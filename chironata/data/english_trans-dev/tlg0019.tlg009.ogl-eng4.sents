OUTSIDE THE HOUSE OF HERACLES.
Enter DIONYSUS walking, and XANTHIAS on a donkey, carrying his masters luggage.X. May I make some old joke, sir, of the sort
At which the audience never fail to laugh ?D.
Yes, anything you like, except ‘I'm bruised Keep clear of that, we've long been sick of it.X.
Nothing else witty?X.
Well now, that very funny joke ?D.
Why, yes, By all means, only mind you don'tX.
Don't what?D. Don't shift your yoke, and ask to ‘ leave the roomX.
Nor say '
My load's so heavy that unless I get relieved, I shall relieve myself'.D. Not till I say I'm going to be sick.X.
Then why had I to carry all these traps, If I do nothing that Ameipsias And Phrynichus and Lycis always make Their luggage-porters do upon the stage ?D.
No, no!
Please don't, for when I'm at the play, And see such tricks as those, I go back home More than a whole year older than I came.X.
Then my poor neck has trebly-rotten luck :
It's sore, but mustn't say so, as that's funny.
D.
He's most impertinent, and vilely spoilt.
Here am I, Dionysus, son of... Cask,
Tramping on foot, and giving him a mount
To save his being tired and bearing weight.X. I bear it, don't I?X.
Yes, bearing this.
X. Well, it's hard to bear.
D.
But the ass, surely, bears the weight you bear.
X.
Not what I've got to bear, I swear he doesn't.D.
How are you bearing, when you're being borne ?X. Can't say-but anyhow this shoulder's bruised.
D. Well, all I say is, if the ass don't help you, You'd better give the ass a lift in turn.
X.
Oh, curse my luck in missing that sea-fight!
Wouldn't I just have made you howl for this!
D. Get off, you scum!
for though I've tramped on foot, I've nearly reached this door, the place where first I must turn in.
Hi!
Boy there !
Boy, I say !
HERACLES.
Who banged the door like that ?
whoever did, 'Twas like a centaur's kicking.
Here 1 what's this ?D. (aside) My boy!X.
What is it?D. Did you notice ?X.
What?D. He's terribly afraidX.
That you're a madman.
H. I can't help laughing!
'pon my soul, I can't:
I bite my lips, but all the same, I laugh.D.
My dear good sir, come here.
I want you, please.
H. But I can't scare away my laughter, really.
What ?
a girl's skirt beneath a lion's skin !
What's up ?
Do slippers and a club agree ?
Where bound for?D. I've been serving—Cleisthenes.H.
Fought in the sea-fight ?D.
Yes, and sank some ships, Some twelve or thirteen of the enemy's.H. I woke:
it was a dream!D.
Well, while on board, as I was all alone And reading the Andromeda, a longing Knocked at my heart, you can t conceive how hardH.
Weren't you with Cleisthenes ?D. Dear boy, don't chaff me, for I'm really ill. “ Such fierce desire is wasting me away.
"H. What sort, my little bruddie ?D. I can't say, And yet I'll try to, by a simile.
You've sometimes felt a sudden lust for soup?
H. Soup ?
blessed thought!
a many thousand times.D. " Are my words plain," or shall I try again ?H.
Not about soup!
0 no!
That's plain enough.D. Well, just exactly so do I desire Euripides.H.
What!
though the fellow's dead ?D.
Yes, and no man's dissuasion can prevent
My going after him.
D. Most certainly, or even down belower.
D. I want a poet with some wits;
" Some are no more, and those we have are bad.
"H. There's Iophon alive.D.
The one good thing That's still remaining, if that's really good:
For I'm by no means certain that it is.H.
But if you must take somebody from there, There Is Sophocles before Euripides.D. No!
I must first get Iophon alone, Apart from Sophocles, and try his metal:
Besides, Euripides is slim enough To try to slip back here with me, but he Is just as easy-going there as here.
D.
He's left me:
he is gone!
A genial poet, missed by all his friends.
D.
To sing ' the song of them that feastH.
But Xenocles?X.
But where do I come in, With my poor shoulder rawed so awfully ?H.
But aren't there here a lot of bits of lads,
Who write ten-thousand tragedies and more, And beat Euripides in talk by furlongs ?D.
They're grapes that never ripen, jabbering things, " Mere schools of swallows," ruiners of Art, Who make one mild assault on Tragedy, Beget one play, and promptly disappear, But a creative poet you won't find, Look where you will, who'll speak a splendid line.
D.
Yes, creative;
one who'll say Some bold original idea like this:
­ " The air, God's bedroom," or " the foot of time Or "
Though my heart refused to swear the oath
My tongue swore falsely what my heart knew not ".
H.
You like that?
D. Like it ?
I go mad with joy.
H. I swear it's drivel, and you think so too.
D. " Rule not my mind ” ;
mind your own house instead.
H. Look here, it's plainly the most feeble stuff.
D. Teach me to dine!X.
But where do I come in ?D.
Now for the reason why I wear this dress,
The same as yours:
I've come to ask what friends
You stayed with (I might want to do the same),
When you went down to fetch up Cerberus.
Tell me about the ports, streets, bakers'-shops, Wells, shelters, sidings, lodgings (double-beds As well as single), and what landladies Keep fewest bugs.X.
But where do I come in ?H.
You daring chap!
Have you the pluck to go ?D.
No more of that, but tell me of the roads, I want to know the quickest way to Hades, And not a hot route nor a very cold.
H. Let's see :
which shall I tell you first, I wonder.
One way to go is by The Rope and Bench, Just hang yourself.
D. Stop, that's a stifling road.
H.
Then there's a path well beaten, a short cut, Go by the Mortar.D. Hemlock, I suppose.
H. Just so.D. But that's a cold and wintry way.
Your shins get numbed the minute you set out.
H. Well, would you try a quick and downhill, road ?D.
I would:
I'm not so very walkative.
H. Just saunter down to Pot-landD.
Yes, what next?
H. Get to the top of that high towerD.
And then?
H. Watch till you see the torch-race being started, And when the lookers-on say ' Send them off!,
Send off yourself as welLD.
Where?
H. Down below!D.
But I should waste a good two pounds of brains.
That's not the road I mean to go.D.
The way you went.H. But there's a long sea trip, For at the first you'll come to a huge lake, All bottomless.
H.
There's an old sailor in a boat this size, Who'll take you all the way across for threepence.
D.
Oh, that ubiquitous Almighty Threepence !
How did it get there ?H.
Theseus introduced it.
Then you'll see snakes, and numberless wild beasts, Most weird.
D.
Don't try to scare or frighten me:
You'll never stop me.H.
Then a mass of mud
And ever-flowing dung, in which they lie
Who ever wronged a stranger anywhere, Or picked a pocket while they stole a kiss, Or beat a mother, gave a father blows Upon the cheek, committed perjury, Or copied out a verse of Morsimus.D.
You surely ought to add another line—
Or learnt the war dance of Cinesias.'H.
Then all around you flutes shall breathe their sound, And you'll see loveliest sunlight, like our own, And myrtle-groves, and happy companies Of men and women, making loud applause.
D.
Who are these people ?X.
I swear, then I'm the donkey in this show.
But there!
(throws down the luggage) I won't stand any more of this.
H.
Who'll tell you anything you'ld like to know, For they live close along the road itself, Just at the very gates of Pluto's home.
Now lad !
Good-bye!
Good luck.D. The same to you :
Lots of good luck. (to XANTHIAS) Pick up those things again.X.
Before they're down ?D.
Yes, and look sharp about it.X. Beg pardon, sir, but can't you hire some man, Some dead chap, coming here to take this trip ?D.
If I can't find one ?X.
Then I'll go.D. All right.
(Enter a funeral procession.)
Why, here's a funeral come just in time.
You there, I say!
I mean the man who's dead ;
Would you take down some bits of things to Hades ?
DEAD MAN.
Let Is see them.D. There.
DM. I shall want eighteen-pence.D.
Then you won't get it.
DM. (to the bearers)
On you go again!D. Stop, my dear sir !
now can't we do a deal?
DM. Pay eighteen-pence, or let's have no more talking.
D. Take one and threepence.
DM. Sooner would I—live!X.
Curse the man's impudence !
Be damned to him!
I'll go myself.D.
You are a real good sort.
Now for the boat.
CH. Hi! easy!
shove her in.X. What Is this?D. What's this ?
Why, this must be the lake
He talked about, and ... yes!
I see a boat.X.
Why, so do I.
There's Charon in it too.
D. Hi!
Charon !
care to carry one across?
CH.
Who's for the place where ills and troubles cease, For Lethe's plain, or Asses'-Shearington, Who's for the Dogs, the Deuce, or—Taenarum ?
CH.
Get in, quick!D.
Where d'you mean to go ?
To the Deuce really ?CH.
Yes, that's right for you.
Get in, do!D.
Here, lad!
CH.
I don't take a slave, Unless he's fought at sea to gain his freedom.X.
Why, no;
unluckily I had bad eyes.
CH.
Then you must run the whole way round the lake.X.
Where shall I wait, then ?
CH.
By the Shrivelling-stone, The Shelter's there.D. You understand ?X. I do;
Worse luck!
What did I meet as I left home ?
Ch. D Sit at your oar.
Any one else?
Look sharp.
What are you doing ?D. Doing?
Why, what else
But sitting on my oar?
You told me to.
CH. Can't you sit there, you fat-guts, eh ?D.
Like this ?
CH.
Get forward now:
stretch out your arms.
D. Like this ?
CH.
Don't keep on fooling, feel your stretcher well, And pull for all you're worth.
D.
But how can I, Who don't know ship, or sea, or Salamis, How can I row ?CH.
Quite easily.
You'll hear Most lovely songs when once you start.
CH. Swanfrogs.
They're splendid!D.
Well then, start us off.
A Company of unseen Frogs, supposed to be under watery begin singing.
FROGS.
Croak, croak, croak, croak!
Sons of the marshy waterspring Lustily chant we our musical lays !
Let us my own sweet carol sing:
Croak!
croak!
we shout aloud.
As we in Marshland, honouring Dionysus, sang the praise Of Zeus's son and Nysa's king, When the merry, tipsy, revelling crowd To my sacred precinct staggered away On the holy Pitchers' day.
Croak, croak, croak, croak!D.
But my behind gets sore, I find.
Croak, croak, croak, croak!
Though you folk there Don't seem to care.
FROGS.
Croak, croak, croak, croak!D. 0 deuce take you and your croaking too !
There's never a word But ' croak' to be heard.
F.
And quite right too, you meddling man ;
For I'm dear to the sweet-songed Muses and Pan, With his horny feet and melodious reeds;
And the harper Apollo loves me well, For deep in the marshes in which I dwell, I rear the stalk that his sweet lyre needs.
Croak, croak, croak, croak !D.
My hands are blistered, Oh dear, Oh!
And my stern was sweating long ago, And when I get forward, 'twill copy your song And utter a similar croak before long.
Come !
stop it, do, you musical crew.
F. Stop it ?
Not we, as you soon shall see:
E'en thus when suns shone merrilie Through weed and sedge we used to leap, Happy and gay, Singing away;
Then diving again, We fled from the rain, Swimming about and diving deep, Fitting our watery madrigal's sound
To the song of the big bubbles bursting around.
D. I haven't been long
In learning your song.
F.
Oh dear!
oh dear!
We shall suffer, I fear.D. But I shall suffer much worse than you, If I have to row till I burst in two.D.
Oh, deuce take you !
I don't care what you do.F. Well croak our song
The whole day long, And every note We've got in our throat Shall find its way out With our vigorous shout, Croak, croak, croak, croak!D.
You won't stop me With that, you'll see.
F.
No more will you, Whatever you do.D.
Oh, not at all!
Why, I'll shout and bawl
If nought else will do, The whole day through, Until somehow I stop your row.
Croak, croak, croak, croak ! ( The Frogs are silent.)
Hullo!
I thought I’Λd make you stop your croak.
CH. Stop !
Easy !
take your oar and shove her in.
You get out here.
Fare, please!D.
There, take your threepence.
Xanthias !
Where's Xanthias ?
Xanthias, are you there ?X. Poof!
Poof!D. Come here.X. I'm glad to see you, sir.D.
What's that out there ?X.
There's darkness there and mud.D.
Well, did you see the parricides he spoke of, And perjurers ?X.
Of course!
Why, didn't you ?D.
Yes, that I did, and I can see them now (pointing to the audience).
What's to be done ?X.
We'd better go ahead, For this must be the place he talked about
Where those weird monsters are.D. Be damned to him '
Twas just his humbug, meant to frighten me :
He knows I'm plucky, and that makes him jealous.
For swagger, nothing equals Heracles.
I should like nothing more than some good row, To make it well worth while our coming here.X. I know you would.
I say!
I hear a noise.
D.
Where is it ?
where ?X. Behind us.X. Now it's in front of us.X.
And now, too, I can see a big wild beast.
D.
What like?X. Oh, awful!
It keeps changing shape;
A cow first,—now a mule,-no, it's a girl!
She's simply lovely!D.
Where ?
I'm after her.X.
Yes, but it's not a girl now, it's a dog.
D.
Then that's Old Bogey.X. Anyhow, its face Is all one blaze.D.
Is one leg made of brass ?X. 'Struth ! that it is, and one of cow-dung too.
'Tis so.D. I'm off, but where?
1X. Yes, where ?
say I.D. (addressing the Priest of Dionysus, sitting in the front row of the theatre) Priest, save me later on, we'll have a drink.
X. King Heracles, we're done for !D. Hush, you fellow!
Don't call me that!
Don't say my name at all.X. Then DionysusD.
Why, that's even worse!X. (to the Bogey) Go on then, if you're going I Here, sir, here !X. Cheer up!
We've done it all to rights.
And we can say, just like Hegelochus, " The storm has passed, and weasel have it fine " Old Bogey's gone.D. You swear it ?X.
That I swear!D. Swear it again.X. I swear!D. Again.X. I swear!
Lord!
when I saw her, didn't I turn pale ?
And what a mess he's made me in, through fright.
D. " Alas!
whence came these ills to fall on me ?
What God shall I call author of my woes ? "
The air, God's bedroom " ? or “ the foot of time " ?X. I say!D.
What is it ?X.
Don't you hear it ?X.
The breath of flutes.D. Yes, and upon me too A very mystic smell of torches came;
But let's crouch down and listen quietly.
(The Chorus of the Initiate approach, singing a Hymn to Iacchus, and enter gradually during the next few lines.)
To thee we sing, Iacchus our King!X.
I've got it, sir.
It's those Initiate He spoke of, playing here.
At any rate That's the same hymn those folk sing through the market.
D.
Yes, so it seems.
The best thing we can do Is to keep quiet;
then we'll find out all.
CHORUS.
To Thee Whom we mightily honour, O King!
E'en here where
Thou dwellest, Iacchus, we sing.
Come to Thy servants, and join with us now The dance through this meadow, Thy holy ones pray.
With the fruit of the myrtle
Thy garland is gay, And the flowers of the myrtle are set on Thy brow, Shake then Thy locks, and tread without fear
The sacred, blameless, sportive measure, More than all else to the Graces dear, Thine own Initiates' purest pleasure.
X. Demeter's daughter !
Highly honoured queen!
What a sweet sniff of roast pork breathed upon me.
—D. Keep quiet!
You might get a bit, with luck.
CH.
Shake the bright torches, Iacchus our king!
Star that gives light to our revels of night, See how the meadow is blazing with light.
Even old men feel their limbs growing gay, Flinging their tedious sad years far away, Such is the might of this mystical rite.
Holy one, hear us!
Let
Thy light cheer us.
On to the meadow that glitters with flowers, On to the plain with this Chorus of ours, On with the youths who Thy mysteries sing.
CHORUS-LEADER.
Keep silence, we pray;
every man must make way as our chorus moves on, and give place, Who cannot take part in our songs, and whose heart the stains of uncleanness disgrace, Who never has seen, nor a worshipper been at the rites of the glorious Muses, Untaught in the song that the rollicking tongue of Cratinus our beef-eater uses, Or delights in the jest that is bad at the best, out of taste, and as much out of season, Nor seeks as he should the citizens' good, and sets not his heart against treason, But stirs up the fire, and blows it up higher, for No.
I anxious to cater, And when, tempest-tossed, the State's Ship seems lost, though in office, is bribed to turn traitor, To our foes letting slip a fort or a ship, smuggling goods that Aegina should have, Despite prohibition, a thorough Thorycion, a dirty tax-gathering knave, Who helps Epidaurus with means to come o'er us, pitch, oar-pads, and canvas for sails, Who some friend will entreat to send pay to the fleet of our enemy, till he prevails, Or, joining the song of the low Cyclic throng, Queen Hecate's statues defiles, Or filches away the poets' due pay, by his villainous orators' wiles, Because of some joke that his venom awoke in our national contest of wit:
Thrice notice receive, thrice notice I give to all the cap happens to fit, Depart and begone, as our chorus moves on, but 'tis your part to keep up the lay, And the revels that last till the night is gone past, and suit this our festival day.
CH. (in procession) HYMN TO PERSEPHONE.
Onward now in manly show
To the flowery fields and vales we go, Dancing and chaffing, Playing and laughing, Now that the plenteous feast is done, Singing lustily every one Hymns to the praise Of our Goddess who says
That she is our Saviour for ever and aye, Whatever Thorycion chooses to say.
CHORUS-LEADER.
And now let us raise a new song of praise to Demeter who brings us the corn, And our voices combine with music divine, our Goddess and Queen to adorn.
CH. Demeter, Queen of holy rites, Stand by, to guard Thy choir, we pray.
Grant us the unalloyed delights Of Jest and Dance the livelong day, And many a joke may I let fall, And many a word of warning add, Praise for the good, blame for the bad, As suits
Thy sacred festival:
And when all's done, may I sit me down, And wreathe my brow with victory's crown.
CHORUS-LEADER.
And now the young and blooming
God let us invite with song
To take in this our dance the share that should to him belong.
CH. O Thou
Whom we honour, Iacchus our king, Thou Who to this our feast dost bring Sweetest and rarest melody, Come to our Goddess, come with me!
And let all see that the longest road Is but easy to Thee, Iacchus our God!
Friend of the dancer, lacchus, lead, Oh!
lead me on!
Here's rare fun, and economy too!
This ragged old coat!
This bit of a shoe !
They're split in two;
but they'll have to do.
For 'tis Thyself hast found us a way Without any loss to dance and play.
Friend of the dancer, lacchus, lead, Oh!
lead me on!
Just now in the dance, when there tripped by my side
The loveliest flapper, I peeped, and I spied In the front of her bodice a pretty big tear, And out looked one breast, so enticingly fair !
Friend of the dancer, lacchus, lead, Oh!
lead me on!D. I always feel inclined to share this sort of game.
That flapper there!
Wouldn't I like the chance to play and dance with her!X.
'Same here,' I say.
(The Chaff at the Bridge.)CH.
Let's now unite our wit, And Archedemus hit, Who'd got no teeth, and joined no guild, at seven years old.
He's now, up overhead, Mob-leader of the dead, And comes out top in everything that's bad and bold.
Then Cleisthenes, they say, Is in a shocking way, Bowed down with grief, he tears his cheeks and his behind;
Among the tombs he creeps, And there for ever weeps Sebinus, his lost lover of the lewdest kind.
While Hippobinus' lad, Our Callias, sails clad With lion-skin on female parts, the foe to find.
D. Can anybody tell
Us where does Pluto dwell, For we're two strangers, only lately come this way ?
CH.
Sir, here you may remain,
And needn't ask again, For there's the door in front of you, as one may say.
D.
Load up again, my lad !X.
What ?
really it's too bad:
Again, again, again, again, again!
all day.
CHORUS LEADER.
Begone!
speed on, Circling round in sacred dance, through the flowery grove, Ye who share this festival dear to the gods above.
I, with the maids and wives, to shed a holy light, Will hie me, where they keep their vigil all the night.
CH. (as they go out)
The flowery meadows now invite With countless roses richly dight.
Forward !
as we ever go,
In fairest dance that man can know.
Kind are the Fates, and we Are here met merrilie.
Us alone the glorious Sun Sends his cheering beams upon, Us, the pure Initiate band, Whose life was just and true To all dwellers in our land, Our friends and strangers too.
D.
Now what's the proper way to knock, I wonder;
The sort of knock the natives give down here.
X. Don't potter at the door.
Try what it's made of.
You're Heracles in figure:
show his vigour.
— D. Boy! Boy!AE.
Who's there ?D.
The mighty Heracles !
AE.
O foul and shameless and audacious man Accurst and all accurst and most accurst!
That stole away our dog, our Cerberus, And seized him by the throat, and dragged him hence, Him whom I kept-but now thou'rt safely caught.
For thee such a black-hearted rock of Styx, And peak of Acheron, that drips with gore, Guard, and the hounds that roam Cocytus round.
Echidna of the hundred heads shall rend
Thine entrails, and upon thy lungs shall fix Tartesian Lamprey, while thy kidneys twain, Yea, and thy very bowels, drenched with blood, Tithrasian Gorgons shall in pieces tear, In quest of whom I'll speed a rushing foot.
(Exit. DIONYSUS falls to the ground.)X.
What have you done ?D. Done . . . something.
Let us pray.X.
You are a joke!
come, get up quick, before Some stranger sees you!D.
Oh, but I'm so faint!
Do bring a sponge, and put it to my heart.
X.
There!
take it, use it.D. Where?X. 0 golden gods!
Your heart's there, is it ?D.
Well, you see, from fright It's crept for refuge to my belly's depths.
X.
Most cowardly of gods and men !D. Who?
I? What ?
Cowardly to ask you for a sponge ?
There's no man else who'ld do as much.X.
What then?D. A coward simply would lie still and stink;
But I stood up, and, what's more, used the sponge.
X. Lord !
you are plucky.D. Yes, I think I am.
But weren't you frightened at his awful words
And threats ?X.
Not I!
I didn't care a damn.
D. Well, since you're brave, and have a plucky fit, Change places with me, take this club of mine
And lion's skin, as you've a fearless heart.
I'll be your baggage-porter in my turn.X. Hand over!
quick!
as I suppose I must;
Now just watch Xanthias-plus-Heracles, See if I'm cowardly, and like yourself.
D.
No, you're just simply Melite's ... bad lot.
Now then, here goes for carrying the traps, (Enter from thefront-door, one of Persephone's maidservants.)
MAIDSERVANT.
You ?
dearest Heracles!
Oh!
do come in.
The minute that our goddess heard you'd come, She baked some loaves, cooked two or three tureens
Of lentil soup, had an ox roasted whole, Made honey-cakes and rolls.
But do come in.X. Thanks!
please excuse me.M. That I won't, indeed!
You shan't refuse.
Why, she's been boiling fowls, She's got dessert, decanted her best wine.
Come, to please me.X
No, thanks.
M. Don't be so silly!
I'll make you.
There's a girl who plays the flute, She's simply lovely, and some chorus-girls, Two or three of them.
X.
What Is that?
Chorus-girls?M. Pretty and young and splendidly got up.
Come in.
They'd got the dinner-table laid, And cook was going to send in the fish.X.
Well, go and first inform those chorus-girls
In there, that I myself am coming in.
(Exit maidservant.)
Now, boy, you come along, and bring my luggage.
D. Drop that!
You can't suppose that when, for fun, I dressed you up like Heracles, I meant it.
Don't keep on fooling, Xanthias, I say, Pick up those traps and carry them again,X.
What ?
you can't mean to take away the things
You yourself gave me!D. Mean it ?
no, but do it.
Off with the skin!X.
Be witness, every man!
I leave this with the gods.
D.
The gods ?
That's good!
What senseless folly to suppose that you, Mortal and slave, could be Alcmena's son.X. Right Oh!
catch hold, perhaps it mayn't be long Before, D.V., you want my help again.
CH.
This is what a man will do Who's got a head, and brains in it too, Who's travelled over waters wide, When the ship rolls, keep the safe side, Instead of standing stock and still, As any painted image will.
No!
he who shifts, in every case, Into a comfortable place, Is cute, or we may say that he's Simply a born ... Theramenes.
D.
A fine joke, yes !
a very fine, If Xanthias, that slave of mine, Wrapped in warm blankets, snug and tight, Cuddled a ballet-girl all night, And bade me fetch him ... what I wouldn't, (Having a ... job ... in hand I couldnt,) Then, while my looks said clearly ‘ No !'
The brute—he's game to do just so, Gave my front teeth a vicious clout And knocked a ‘chorus' of them out.
(Enter the LANDLADY OF AN INN, followed by her maidservant PLATHANE.)LANDLADY.
Here, Plathane !
look, here's that nasty wretch
Who came into our inn some time ago
And ate up sixteen loaves of ours.
PLATHANE.
Dear!
yes!
The very same.X. (aside) That's bad for somebody.
L. Aye, and stewed beef too, twenty plates of it, Penny-a-mouthful each.X. (aside) Some one will catch it.L. And all that lot of garlic.
D. Rubbish!
ma'am;
You don't know what you're saying.
L. Did you think
That if you wore those shoes, I shouldn't know you ?
Why, there I I've never mentioned all that fish.
P. Dear, no!
nor that fresh cheese, Oh drat the man !
He ate the basket it was in, as well, And when I tried to make him pay the bill, He glared so fierce, he did, and roared at me.X.
That's him !
He always does that sort of thing.
L.
And drew his sword, he did.
I thought him mad.P.
Yes, dear!L.
And you and I got so afraid, We scuttled up the ladder to the loft, Then up he picked our rugs, and off he rushed.
X.
That's him again;
but something should be done.
L.
You go and fetch my patron Cleon here.
P. Fetch me Hyperbolus, if you can find him.
We'll pound the man to bits.
L. You cursed throat!
How I should love to take a stone, and smash
Those teeth of yours, that ate that food of mine!
P. How I should love to chuck you in the Pit!L.
How I should love to take a scythe, and np
That gullet out, which swallowed up my tripe!
But off I go to Cleon, for a summons;
He'll twist the whole lot out of him to-day.
(Exeunt LANDLADY and PLATHANE.)D.
Don't I love Xanthias!
Curse me if I don't!X. I know!
I know you !
Stop it!
Stop that talk.
I won't be Heracles, I won't.D. Please, please!
My little Xanthie!X.
How could I, a slave, A mortal too, become Alcmena's son ?D. I know, I know you’re cross, and you're quite right, And if you beat me, I shan't say a word;
But, if I ever rob you after this, May I, my wife, my children, root and branch, Be damned!
... and sore-eyed Archedemus too!X.
That oath will suit.
I'll do it on those terms.
CH.
What you've got to do is plain, Now you take that dress again
Which you lately had to wear ;
Make yourself as young as you can, Look a most ferocious man, Like the god whose form you bear.
If you play the fool at all, If you take to talking small, Soon you'll hear his old refrain '
Pick that luggage up again !
1X.
Friends, your advice is not amiss;
I was thinking too of this, Only just this minute.
I know that, if he finds it pay Once more to take this dress away, a. He'll pretty soon begin it.
Still, you shall see me play the man
And look as peppery as I can.
I guess I'll have to, for I'm sure I hear a rattling of the door.
(Enter AEACUS and three Policemen.)AE.
Seize that dog-stealer!
quick, you two!
we'll have
The law of him.D. (aside) That's bad for somebody.
X.
Get back, you two!
Deuce take you!
AE.
Fighting, eh ? - Come on, you, Ditylas and Skeblyas !
Here !
Pardokas !
Come on, and fight this man.D.
Now isn't it too bad to steal folk's things,
And then to fight like this ?
AE.
It's infamous!D. Quite sad !
Quite dreadful!X.
S'help me now!
look here!
If ever I came here before, or stole A scrap of what was yours, just string me up.
And now I'll treat you like a gentleman.
Look !
here's my slave:
take him and torture him.
If I'm proved guilty, let me have the halter.
AE.
Torture him?
how?X.
Try everything:
the rack, The cat, the knout;
or hang him by the thumbs, Heap bricks on him, squirt acids up his nose.
Do what you like, but one thing I must bar, Don't beat him with a leek or a spring-onion.
AE.
That's fair enough;
and if I harm the boy By flogging him, I'll pay you damages.
X.
Oh, that won't matter.
Take him off to torture.
AE.
No, we'll examine him before your face.
Down with the traps, you.
Quick!
and mind you tell No lies.
D. I warn all men that it's unlawful To torture me who am immortal;
else, You'll have yourself to blame.
AE.
What's that you say ?D. I'm son of Zeus, immortal, Dionysus;
And that's my slave.
AE.
You hear him ?X.
Yes, I do.
All the more reason for his being flogged, If he's a god, he'll never notice it.
D.
Well, come now, if you say that you're a god, Why not take just as many blows as I ?X.
That's fair enough.
And now, the one you see Cries out the first, or seems to mind the pain Of beating, you may say he's not a god.
AE.
Well!
I must say you are a gentleman.
You go straight in for justice.
Strip now, both.X.
How will you try us fairly ?
AE.
That's quite easy.
Hit one, then hit the other.X.
That's all right.X. Mind you notice if I wince at all.
AE.
I've hit you.X.
That you haven't.
AE.
So it seems.
I'll go and hit the other.
—AE.
I've hit you.D.
Did I sneeze ?
I ought to have.
AE.
Can't say.
I'll try the other man again.X. Be quick!
It's awful.
ME. Awful ?
What ?
the pain I gave you ?X.
No ! to think I can't tell when My feast at Diomeia's coming off.
AE.
How truly pious !
Now the other man.D. I see some Cavalry.AE.
But why these tears ?D.
Their onions make me cry.AE.
You're not in pain ?D.
Not I, not in the least.
AE.
Then I'll go back and try the other man.
AE.
What is it ?X.
“Rid me of this thorn !”AE.
Well, this is strange.
Once more the other man.D. " 0 God ...
Thou god of Delos, Pytho's Lord."X. That hurt.
You heard him ?D. Nonsense!
I was trying To recollect one of Hipponax' hymns.X.
You're doing nothing.
Hit him in the ribs.
AE.
No, that's no good.
Here, turn your belly round.D. " O Lord!" ...X.
That hurt.D. "
We raise our song to Thee. - Thine the Aegean cliffs, the deep gray sea."AE.
Upon my soul, I can't as yet be sure
Which is the god.
But come in, both of you.
My lord himself, and Persephassa too, As they're both gods, will find it out at once.
D.
That's true, but I could wish you'd thought of this In time to save my having all those blows.
(Exeunt omnes.)CHORUS."
Come, Muse, to our hallowed chorus, Come forth to the joy of my song.
And gaze on the people before us, A wise and a numberless throng."
Not so eager is Cleophon found, On whose faultily-chattering tongue
The chirps of the swallow resound In a loud Thracian bellowing song, In a groan from the grove of the stranger, A nightingale's roaring, a cry ‘Though acquitted, he 'scapes not the danger, He surely will die.'CHORUS-LEADER.
It befits the sacred chorus on our city to bestow Good advice and good instruction.
First then, for we hold it so, Citizens should all be equal, terror's reign be done away, And if any through the tricks of Phrynichus have gone astray, Those I say who've made a slip, should be allowed to cancel all Former errors, after showing what it was that caused their fall.
Next, there's no man here should be deprived of citizens' full rights ;
For 'tis hard if those who chance to fight in one of our sea-fights
Should be changed from slaves to lords, and rank as the Plataeans do;
Not that I'm at all inclined to say that this is wrong of you.
No!
I praise you:
this one thing, and this alone, your wisdom shows:
But, besides, those men who've often fought with you against your foes, And their fathers too before them, men who are your kith and kin, Should be pardoned, as they beg, for this their one and only sin.
Come then, lay aside your anger, 0 ye wisest of man­ kind, Gladly let's enrol among our kinsfolk every man we find Fighting on our side, and give him all a citizen's full rights.
But if we should swell and swagger, if our land our pride excites, While, amid the rolling waves, the ship of state is in distress, We shall find some day that all men call our wisdom foolishness.
CH. "
If I rightly can judge of the ways
Of a man who must shortly lament," That ape little Cleigenes' days — (How he bores us) ere long will be spent;
That meanest of bathing-house kings, The lords of Cimolian clay, And inferior poisonous things
That compose the cheap soaps of to-day.
This he sees, and that's why, I should say, He's no liking for peace;
but he knows He'd be certainly stripped, pretty quick, (As he staggers home drunk) of his clothes, If he hadn't that stick.
CHORUS-LEADER.
It has very often struck us that our State behaves the same
To those citizens of ours who best of all deserve the name
As to our old-fashioned coinage and the gold of recent date;
For we've ceased to use the finest coinage found in any State Unalloyed and undebased, and stamped with dies that none excel, (Such at least is our opinion) ringing clear as any bell, Coins that pass among the Greeks and foreigners where'er they be;
No, instead of these we've got this wretched copper novelty, Coined a day or two ago, and stamped with a most shabby die.
So, the men whose birth is noble, and whose character is high, Upright men, who nought unworthy of a gentleman would do, Men who've learnt the noblest training of the mind and body too, These we slight;
but red-haired slaves and strangers of the brassy breed, Base in birth and base in nature, we employ for every need, These we trust, these last arrivals, fellows such as this our State To employ for very scapegoats once would gravely hesitate.
Come then, 0 you foolish people, lay your evil ways aside;
Use the useful once again, for if success this change betide Great your gain, while if you make a slip, all men of sense will see, If you must be hanged, at least you're hanged upon a decent tree.
AE.
Lord save us all!
Why, what a gentleman, Your master is.X. Oh, quite a gentleman, Whose only two ideas are wine and women!
AE.
Well, but not flogging you when you were proved Not to be master, as you said, but slave.
X. He'd better!
AE.
Spoken like a thorough slave Exactly!
I love doing that myself.X.
You like it, really?
AE.
Lord!
I feel in heaven,
When I can curse my master unbeknown.X.
What, when you come out muttering to yourself, After a hiding ?
AE.
That's a pleasure too.X.
What about meddling ?
AE.
Lord !
there's nothing like it.X. Same creed as mine!
And when you overhear Our masters' talk ?
AE.
I go clean off my head.X.
When you retail it all outside ?
AE.
What then ?
Why then I simply ... can't contain myself.X.
My word !
give me your hand, let's shake, and kiss
Like brothers !
and do tell me, by the God Who's patron of such jailbirds as us two, What's all this noise indoors and quarrelling And shouts ?
AE.
Euripides and Aeschylus ...X. Ah!AE.
There's a great, a very great, to-do Among the dead, a regular revolt.X.
Why?
AE.
Well, we've got a law in force down here
That the best man among the candidates, Out of all arts accounted great and high, Shall dine for nothing in the Public Hall, And have a seat next Pluto . . .X.
Ah, I see!
AE.
Until some other who's a better man Arrives, and then the first gives up his place.X.
How could this inconvenience Aeschylus ?
AE.
You see, he held the throne of Tragedy, As best Tragedian?X.
Well, who has it now ?
AE.
Why, when Euripides arrived, he gave Lectures to parricides and pickpockets
And thieves and burglars (we've a tidy lot Of such folk here), and when they heard his turns
And twists, and tricks of argument, they all Went worse than mad, and voted him the best, And he got so conceited that he claimed The throne from Aeschylus ...X.
And so got pelted ?
AE.
Lord !
no.
The folk cried out to try the case, And see which of them was the better man.X.
The blackguard-folk?
AE.
Lord !
yes.
They split the sky.X.
Had Aeschylus no friends to back him up ?AE. "
What's good is scarce."
It's just the same as here.
(pointing to the audience)X.
Then what does Pluto now propose to do ?
AE.
To hold at once a contest and a trial, And test the skill of each.X.
But tell me why The throne was never claimed by Sophocles.
AE.
By him ?
Why, there !
as soon as he came down,
He just kissed Aeschylus, and shook his hand And never thought of claiming it.
But now He means, according to Cleidemides, To ‘ wait and see'.
If Aeschylus should win He'll do no more, but if Euripides, For art's sake, he must fight it to the death.
X.
Will it come off?
AE.
It will, and pretty soon.
And then such wonders will be started here!
They're going to weigh poetry in scales.X.
What's that ?
treat tragedy like joints of meat ?
AE.
And bring out rules and rods to measure lines, And pattern-moulds,X.
What ?
going to make bricks ?.
AE.
And squares and wedges, for Euripides Says he shall test their dramas verse by verse.X.
That's hard for Aeschylus to bear, I'm sure.
AE. " E'en as a baited bull his brows he bent."X. Who's to be judge then ?
AE.
That was hard to say, Since cultivated men were scarce, they found;
For Aeschylus and Athens weren't on terms.
X.
Such lots of burglars, I suppose he thought.
AE.
But 'twas a farce, he held, for other folk To judge of poets' brains ;
so now they've asked Your master, as experienced in the art.
But let's go in, for when our lords are keen
On any thing, we may look out for squalls.
(Exeunt.)CH.
Surely a mighty storm of passion
Will in the loud-thunderer's heart hold sway, When he catches a glimpse of his sharp-tongued foe, Eagerly whetting his tusks for the fray;
Then will his eyes roll to and fro, In frenzy's wild terrific fashion.
Words will be bristling like plumes in fight
On the glancing helms, when fierce is the strife, And splinters whirl off left and right, And fairest works are hacked by the knife, As the poor soul parries the words of might, That draw from a master-mind their life.
For shaking the neck that is covered all o'er With a rugged, shaggy, bristling mane
And frowning fierce, he will utter a roar, Hurling huge jointed words again and again, As though great planks asunder he tore, While he pants like a mighty giant in pain.
Then that critic of verse, a tongue sharp and keen, That speaks from the lips and not from the heart, Writhing and champing the bit, in its spleen, Shall range words together and set them apart, And vast though the toil of the lungs has been, 'Twill be pared down to nought by the disputant's art.
Enter DIONYSUS, AESCHYLUS, and EURIPIDES.EURIPIDES.
I won't give up the throne;
don't talk of it:
I say I'm his superior in our art.
DIONYSUS.
Why silent, Aeschylus ?
you hear his words.
EU.
He'll first assume an air of grand reserve;
It's an old trick of his in all his plays.
D. Come, my dear sir, don't be too hard on him.
EU. I know him !
I saw through him long ago, The poet of the savage, stubborn-mouthed;
His tongue knows nought of curb, restraint, or check.
What's argument to him, big bag of swagger?
AESCHYLUS.
" Indeed ?
you son of the " greengrocer " goddess ” !
You call me that ?
you gossip-monger, you!
You beggars' playwright, botcher of old rags !
Say it again!
you daren't.D. Stop, Aeschylus! “
Heat not thy heart to fury in thy wrath.”AE. Stop ?
Not before I've shown what right he has, This cripples' playwright, to insult me thus.D. A lamb!
a black one!
here, boys!
bring it out.
A downright hurricane is coming on.
AE.
You, who collected Cretan solo-songs!
Who put incestuous wedlock on the stage !D. Excuse me, highly honoured Aeschylus!
Out of the way, you poor Euripides !
Avoid the hailstorm, if you've any sense, Lest with some topping word he strike your head
In anger, and knock out your ... Telephus.
Don't lose your temper, Aeschylus, but calmly Test, or be tested.
Poets can't indulge
In virulent abuse, like bakers' wives.
You start by roaring like a blazing log.
EU.
I'm ready, and I won't back out of it, To cut up, or to let him cut up first
The verses, songs, and sinews of my plays, My Meleager, and my Aeolus, My Peleus, and what's more, my Telephus.D.
What's your intention, Aeschylus ?
Let's hear.
AE.
I had no wish for any contest here, For we don't meet on equal terms.
D.
How's that?
AE.
Because my poems didn't die with me.
His did, and so he'll have them here to quote.
Still, if you think it right, it must be done.
D. Now, some one, bring me incense here and fire, That I may pray, before this war of wits, To judge this case in most artistic wise, While you invoke the Muses with a hymn.
CHORUS.
O
Ye pure maids,
Ye heavenly nine!
Muses
Who watch o'er the minds well filled with shrewd­ ness and learning, Minds of the coiners of wit, whose hearts for the contest are burning, Striving the one with the other in wrestling, in twisting, in turning, Come hither, and gaze on the wonderful might Of two tongues surpassing all men of to-day In production of words and of verse-filings fine, For now in real earnest they're ready to fight
The great battle of wit without any delay.
D. Pray now, you two, before you say your lines.
AE. " Demeter, Foster-mother of my soul, May I be worthy of thy mysteries !”D. Take incense now and offer.
EU.
Thank you, no.
The gods I pray to are another sort.
D. Some of your own, fresh coined ?
EU.
Exactly so.D. Call on your amateur-gods, then, for help.
EU. " O air, my food, 0 pivot of my tongue, O mother-wit, 0 nostrils keen of scent," May I confute all words that I attack!
CH.
The very thing that we want to do Is to hear the way in which you two, A clever couple, mean to fight.
Your tongues are sharpened for the fray, Your pluck's unflinching, and your wits Are fired with rivalry, so 'tis right To think the one will make some hits
In a shrewd and polished way;
Whilst the other will on him fall Tearing words up, root and all, And the subtle lines confound That throng his foeman's wrestling-ground.
D.
Well, now you must begin at once, but mind your words are clever;
Avoid similitudes:
let's have no commonplace whatever.
EU.
As for myself, whatever are my merits as a poet I'll tell you last, but first I say of him, and mean to show it,.
He fooled and gulled the audience :
with cheating tricks he caught them, Whose wits were none the brightest after Phrynichus had taught them.
For at the start, upon the stage he'ld set some muffled creature, Achilles, say, or Niobe—you never saw a feature-
A trick to hide the play's weak points, — and not one grunt they muttered.
D.
No more they did.
EU.
Meanwhile the chorus hammered on, and uttered Four songs or so on end, the actors silent still remaining,D. I liked their silence, and I thought it quite as enter­ taining
As nowadays the talk is.
EU.
You were dull of comprehension:
That's clear.
D.
No doubt I was, but what was what's-his-name's in­ tention ?
EU.
'Twas just a dodge to make the audience quietly sit heeding What Niobe was going to say — the play meanwhile proceeding.
D.
The villain that he is!
and how he took me in completely!
What makes you fret and fume ?
EU.
Because I show him up so neatly.
Then after all this fooling, when the play was half com­ pleted, The actor, roaring like a bull, some dozen words repeated Made up of " plumes " and " eyebrows ", ghostly sounds, enought to haunt you, None ever heard the like.
AE.
God help meD.
Do be quiet, can't you ?
EU.
Not one intelligible wordD.
Do keep your teeth from gnashing!
EU.
But " fosses " or " Scamanders ", or " weird griffin-eagles, flashing "
From " brass-wrought work on targes ", and huge beetling­ cliff-like twaddle
That seemed to make small sense.
D. Hear!
hear!
I know my poor old noddle Ached all one night—I got no sleep, by ceaseless thought tormented As to what sort of bird the "tawny cock-horse" represented.
AE.
'Twas a ship's painted figure-head, you dullest of dull creatures!D.
How like Philoxenus's chick Eryxis in its features !
EU.
D'you think, in writing plays, a cock's a help to inspi­ ration ?
AE.
You God-forsaken fool, let's hear the works of your creation.
EU. Mine? not “cock-horses”—not “goat-stags”, like yours, you may be certain;
The sort of things embroidered on some Persian hanging­ curtain.
But when I took our Art in hand, and found you'd left her swelling
And crammed with turgid style, and words whose weight was past all telling, I started thinning diet, and reduced her gross condition
By verselets, little walks, white beet, and by the exhibition Of small-talk juice;
—’twas from my books that I distilled this factor ;
-
Then fed her up with Solos,D. (aside) Plus Cephisophon, your actor!
EU.
Nor trifled with chance subjects, nor mixed all in muddling mystery.
But when the play began, the actor sketched at once the history
Of all the plot.D. (aside)
Your history would less well bear narration.
EU.
Then from the first no character was void of occupation;
All had to talk;
the wife, the slave, the lord, alike were treated;
The girl, the crone, all just the same.
AE.
Were justice duly meted
You would have died for such a crime.
EU.
There, there!
no need to halloa:
I wrote as a sound Liberal.D. Come, come!
you didn't follow
The straightest line in politics :
let's hear no mor e about it.
EU.
And then I taught these folk to talk.
AE.
Yes!
nobody could doubt it.
And if you'd burst in two instead, the better for our nation.
EU.
Then subtle rules I brought, and squares for metre­ regulation.
They learnt to think, see, understand, pervert, contrive dissension, Think evil, question everything.
AE.
True I such was your intention.
EU.
I dealt with scenes in which we live and move and have our being, Which any one could criticize, the audience clearly seeing
If I transgressed the laws of art, but ne'er did I, by dragging Their minds away from reasoning, dumbfounder folk by bragging Of "Cycnus" here, or "Memnon" there, with bells on horses' collars ”.
And you can tell apart at once my own and this man's scholars;
Megaenetus the 'Ninepin' is his style, and so's Phor­ misius, " Spearpoint - moustachioed trumpeters, pine - bending sneerers vicious;
" But Cleitophon's my sort, and so's Theramenes the clever-D. Theramenes ?
A wily chap !
He's never nonplussed— never!
If you and he are partners in a scrape, in half-a-minute Your Coan friend-no Chian, he!—nips out, and leaves you in it.
EU.
Well, that's the way in which I taught
These folk to use their brains, and brought Into my dramas calculation
And diligent investigation, So that they now know This from That And well consider what they're at.
Their homes are better managed, too, Now that they ask ‘
Where's this ?' and ‘ Who Took that ?' and ‘What means this to-do ?'D.
They do, indeed-now each Athe­ nian going home, immediately Shouts to his servants every one, And asks them '
Where's the pitcher gone ?'
‘Who's bitten off the sardine's head ?' I
And is my last year's soup-plate dead ‘I left some garlic yesterday,' ‘That olive has been gnawed, I say.'
But Lord !
instead of acting so, Only a year or two ago, The Mollycoddles sat and gazed Like gaping Moon-calves, daft and dazed.
CH. "
This thou beholdest, Achilles the bravest!"
But what will you say in answer, pray ?
Only beware Lest your anger's reckless force Sweep you right outside the course ;
For his charges are the gravest.
So, true heart, take care!
Don't begin in wrath to rail
Take in reefs, and shorten sail, Then keep gently, gently speeding, Wisely heeding, Not attacking till the breeze is steady and the weather fair.
And now, thou who first of our countrymen durst raise an edifice stately of song, Making tragedy's prate grow grand and ornate, take heart, let the flood sweep along.
AE.
I am grievously vexed, and my heart is perplexed at the evil that falls to my lot, Since 'tis fated that I to him must reply:
Should he say, then, no answer I've got, Come tell me, I pray, for what do you say a poet deserves admiration ?
Eu.
If his counsel be wise, if he soundly advise, and so make the men of our nation Better men than they were.
AE.
Then if you had no share in doing the things you have said, But when they were good, and such as men should be, you turned them out worthless instead, What penalty, pray, do you think you should pay ?D.
Don't ask him !
why, death's the right thing.
AE.
See now what they were when, fresh from my care, he first took them under his wing;
Tall gallant and good sixfooters they stood, not cowardly mean duty-shirkers, Not lubberly louts, not the humbugging touts of to-day, nor yet villainy-workers;
And the joys of their heart were the spear and the dart, and the helm with its white waving crest, And the greave and the axe;
and they met all attacks with a seven-ox-hide-covered breast.
EU.
I knew it!
our bane is upon us again!
Those helmets!
my head will be broke !D.
And what was the way in which, as you say, you made them such excellent folk ?
Come, Aeschylus, come!
don't be sullen and dumb with stubborn and angry disdain.
AE.
By my play all aflame with battle.
D. Its name ?
AE.
I The Knights of the Theban campaign , Which all who have heard have felt their heart stirred with a longing to rush on the foe.D.
Well, that was in fact a villainous act, for you've taught all the Thebans to grow More manly by far when they meet us in war, for which a good hiding's your due.
AE.
But you might have been taught, like them, and you ought,-but you paid no attention thereto.
Then ‘The Persians' I brought on the stage, and I wrought in all minds an enthralling desire
To conquer the foe, making noble deeds glow still brighter by poesy's fire.
D.
That's all very well, when they came on to tell of Darius's death, I must say I was glad he was dead, but the chorus instead beat their hands thus, and cried ‘Well-a-day!'AE.
Aye, such are the things your true poet sings, for ask of the days that are gone, What help for our needs has come from the deeds the noblest of poets have done.
'Twas Orpheus who taught us religion, and brought us to keep from all bloodshedding ways, And Musaeus revealed how disease should be healed, and made oracles plain to our gaze.
Did not Hesiod show how to plough, reap, and sow, and Homer the godlike, whence sprang
The honour and fame that encompass his name?
From the fact that the songs which he sang Taught warriors to fight, march, arm them aright.
D. Well, Pantocles, clumsiest lout, Didn't learn it, you know, for a few days ago, when the Festival-Guard was marched out, He clapped his helm straight on the top of his pate, and then wanted to fix on the crest.
AE.
But he taught others many, as stout hearts as any, brave Lamachus one of the best, The moulds by whose use my mind would produce grand deeds that my lion-heart folk My Teucers might do, my Patrocluses too, our country­ men's hearts to provoke
To a standard as high to aspire, when the cry of the war­ trumpet calls to the fray.
But, by Heaven above!
Sthenoboea's lewd love, or Phaedra's, I scorned to portray
And nobody says that in one of my plays a passion­ swayed woman you'll see.
EU.
That's certainly true, for passion and you were strangers.
AE.
And long may we be !
But passion on you, and your home-circle too, swooped down with such terrible force
That she soon laid you low.
D. By Heaven, that's so !
we know it, we know it, of course!
What you wrote of the lives of other men's wives is simply what happened to you.
EU.
Tell me, fool, your ideas about my Sthenoboeas, what harm to the state do they do ?
AE.
Why, honest men's wives, who had lived honest lives, took poison,—you taught them to do it,- And died with foul shame disgracing their name:
your Bellerophon-folk drove them to it.
EU.
You surely don't hold that the tale which I told of Phaedra was really untrue ?
AE.
No !
true as could be;
but my point is that we should hide what is bad out of view,
And not bring it out and parade it about, for whereas little children at school Must always obey what an elder may say, over adults the poet bears rule.
We are bound to teach men what is useful.
EU.
If then Lycabettus is one of your themes, Or again if you write of Parnassus's height, you ‘teach what is useful', it seems.
You certainly should talk just as men would.
AE.
Poor critic, you surely must see
That words born of great thought and sentiment ought as noble an offspring to be.
Besides, reason teaches that demigods' speeches need language exceeding our powers, For this we confess, when we clothe them in dress far grander than ours.
When such things, through me, were as right as could be, you ruined it all.
AE.
First, you wrapped up your kings in shabby old things, so that people who went to the play Might think what they wanted was pity.
EU.
Well, granted.
What harm do you say that I've done ?
AE.
Why, out of the lot of rich men that we've got, we can't raise a trierarch!
not one !
But in rags each appears, and bursts into tears, and swears that he hasn't a groat.
D.
You're right!
It's quite true !
but he's decent clothes too, underneath, and a warm woolly coat, And if by this plea he gets off, why, you'll see he pops up in the Fishmarket quick.
AE.
Then you taught them to chatter on every matter, and learn every gossiping trick, Till we never can meet with a single athlete, and our boys to their school-benches stick With worn-out behinds, and gossip-fed minds;
and even our sailors are told To argue if they need orders obey, but in my days, the brave days of old, They knew nothing at all except just to bawl for their rations, and sing out 1 Heave-ho!
'D.
And their scorn to display in the filthiest way for the poor lubbers rowing below, And play some foul joke on a messmate, and poke their hands in folk's pockets ashore.
But now they all argue, and simply won't row, Aimlessly pottering to and fro.AE.
But is there a wrong he hasn't wrought, Who on our stage vile panders brought, Women their brothers marrying, Women in temples travailing, And deeming death and life one thing ?
And so our land has grown to be Full of an under-clerkling crew, And vulgar-mouthed mob-monkeys too, Cheating our folk incessantly.
And in the Torch-race, there's not one, Through want of training, fit to run.D.
That's true, I'll swear !
I know that I Last Panathenaea, got quite dry With laughing, when I saw a man, A fat, pale, lazy chap, who ran Bending double, coming in last, In terrible trouble;
and, as he passed, The Potterfolk at the gates began To smack his paunch, ribs, sides, and stern, Till their slaps made him sick of the whole concern, So at last his pent-up steam found vent, And puffed out the torch!-and away he went.
CHORUS.
Great is the matter, vast is the strife, fierce is the war that's now beginning.
'Twill be hard to say who's winning, When one attacks with might and main, And the other wheels about and drives his foeman back again.
Don't remain inert, and slack.
There are many ways of trying cunning modes of fresh attack.
Say, then, what's your next endeavour, Charge!
and give us something dashing, The old and modern styles of slashing.
Make a bold attempt to tell us something witty, something clever.
If, however, you're afraid that those who form your audience Haven't brains to see the sense
Of the witty things you say, Don't be shy about it, things are altered in the present day.
All are old campaigners here;
Every one has got a book, and crams up all the rules of Art;
Wits, by nature very clever, Now are sharpened more than ever.
To it!
then, and have no fear
For your hearers, since they're wise enough to understand their part.
EU.
Well now I'll take your prologues first in hand
To test the foremost part of tragedy Before all else, with this our clever friend;
For when he states a thing, he's quite obscure.
D.
Which do you mean to test ?
EU.
Oh!
lots of them.
The Oresteia first;
begin with that.D. Be silent, all!
Now, Aeschylus, begin.AE. "
Hermes below, o'er-watching Father's sway, Be thou my Saviour, help me when I call, For hither am I come, and do return.”D. Anything wrong ?Eu.
A dozen faults and more.
D.
Why that's not all, but only just three lines.
Eu. Yes, but each one of them has twenty faults.
D. I beg you, Aeschylus, be silent;
else More will be scored against you than three lines.
AE.
Silent for him ?D.
Yes, that's what I advise.
EU.
Why, at the start his blunders are sky-high.
AE.
You're talking nonsense.D. Well, then, please yourself.
AE.
Where am I wrong ?
Eu. Begin the lines again.
AE. " Hermes below, o'er-watching Father's sway."Eu. Does not Orestes say this at the tomb
Of his dead father ?
AE.
To be sure he does.
Eu.
Then did Orestes mean that when his father Was foully murdered in a treacherous way By his own wife, Hermes watched over this ?
AE.
Not he!
It was as one who brings us help
He called ‘Hermes below', and proved this, saying
That he derived this office from his Father.
Eu.
Then your mistake is worse than I supposed;
For if he held this office from his FatherD.
He was a body-snatcher by descent!
AE.
You, Dionysus, drink foul-smelling wine.
D.
Now the next line;
and, you, look out for faults.
AE. " Be thou my Saviour, help me when I call, For hither am I come, and do return."EU.
Wise Aeschylus has said the same thing twice :
EU.
You mark the words ;
I'll quote you them, " Here am I come," he says, " and do return”. " Am come " is just the same as " do returnD.
Yes, just like asking any one to lend A trough to knead in, and a kneading-trough.
AE.
Far from it!
You have talked away your wits Into stupidity.
They're perfect lines.D.
How so ?
Please tell me how you make that out.
AE.
When some one has a right to come, we say He comes, apart from anything besides.
An exile, now, returns as well as comes.D.
That's splendid !
What say you, Euripides?
Eu. Orestes, I assert, did not return, He came back on the sly, without permission.
D.
That's good!—(aside) although I don't know what you mean.
EU.
Now for another line.
D. Yes, say some more, Quick, Aeschylus;
and you see what's amiss.
AE. "
And on this barrow, I beseech my sire To hear and hearken."EU.
Same thing twice, again:
To “hear”, and “hearken”, clearly just the same.
D. 'Twas to the dead he spoke, you silly man.
We call three times, and yet can't make them hear.
AE.
But what about your prologues ?
EU.
You shall hear.
If I repeat myself, or load my lines With needless padding, you may spit on me!D. Quick then!
Begin !
I simply yearn to hear
The perfect measure of your prologues' lines.EU. "
A happy man at first was Oedipus."AE.
Not he, I swear !
for he was born unhappy.
Why, when he wasn't born, Apollo said He'ld kill his father—yes !
before his birth:
So how was he a happy man at first ?EU. "
Then he became most wretched of mankind."AE.
Not he, I swear!
he never left it off.
Why, just as soon as ever he was born, In winter, they exposed him in a crock, To stop his growing up to kill his father, And then he limped to Poly bus-and doom, Lamed in both legs, then married an old crone, While he was young—’twas his own mother too, Then poked his eyes out.
D.
If he held command With Erasinides, I call him happy.
Eu. Nonsense!
I think my prologues excellent.
AE.
Look here, now !
I won't cut your lines to bits Verse after verse, but heaven helping me, I'll spoil your prologues with a little flask.
EU. You! mine!
and with a little flask ?
AE.
Just one.
You write them so that any little thing Such as a little fleece or flask or bag Fits every one.
I'll show you right away.
EU.
You'll show me, will you ?D.
Now, you must quote.
EU. " Aegyptus, as the tale is mostly told, With fifty sons who manned a well-oared boat At Argos landing ”AE.
Lost a little flask.
EU.
Bad luck to it!
Deuce take your little flask!D. Give us another:
let me see again.
EU. " Dionysus, who with wands, and hides of fawns Girt round him, dances down Parnassus' slope Amidst the torches "AE.
Lost a little flask.D. " Ah me!
once more they smite us with ”....the flask.
EU.
Well, never mind !
for I've a prologue now To which he can't tack on his little flask. "
No man is fortunate in every way.
If good by birth, he has no means of life, If ill-born, he has "AE.
Lost a little flask.
EU.
What is it?D. Take in sail !
This little flask will blow a hurricane.
EU. Indeed I shan't.
I wouldn't think of it.
I'll knock it clean out of his hands with this.
D. Go on, then, and avoid the little flask.
EU. "Cadmus, Agenor's son, when he had left His city, Sidon,"AE.
Lost a little flask.D. My dear good sir!
buy back that little flask, Lest it tear up our prologues.
EU.
What d'you say?
Buy it from him ?D.
Yes, that's what I advise.
Eu. Not I—for I have many prologues more
To which he can't tack on his little flask.
" To Pisa Pelops, son of Tantalus, With swift steeds speeding,"AE.
Lost a little flask.D. There!
he's tacked on his little flask again.
Dear Sir, by all means let him have it back !
You'll get a downright beauty for three half-pence.
EU.
Not yet, I swear!
I've lots of prologues left.
" From Earth once Oeneus "AE.
Lost a little flask.
EU.
Allow me first to finish all the line.
" From earth once
Oeneus gained a goodly crop, And, offering firstfruits,”AE.
Lost a little flask.
D. What's that ?
Who stole it while he said his prayers ?
EU.
Leave us alone, Sir!
Let him try with this.
" Zeus, as is told us by the word of Truth "D.
You're done for!
he'll say 'lost a little flask'.
For this same little flask sticks to your lines
Just like so many styes upon your eyes.
For heaven's sake, let's try his lyric songs.
EU.
See now, I know that I can show he wrote Bad lyric songs and all of them alike,What can be going to happen now ?
'Twould puzzle my wits to discover how He means to find fault with the man who could sing More songs by far, more worthy of praise, Than all the poets nowadays.
For I wonder how he can hope to bring Discredit upon our mighty king Inspired by heaven to tune his lay, And I fear he never can win the day.
EU.
Most wondrous songs indeed.
You'll soon see that;
For I shall cut his songs all down to one.
D. Look here, I'll take some stones, and keep the score.
EU. "
Say wherefore, Achilles of Phthia, that hearest the slaughter of men, Alas for the blow!
no succour thou bringest."
“ Hermes, our Father, we honour, a race who abide near the fen.
Alas for the blow !
no succour thou bringest.
"D. A couple of blows for you, Aeschylus, those.
EU. “ Atreus' son, Achaia's glory, Lord of wide rule !
list to my story.
Alas for the blow !
no succour thou bringest."D. There, Aeschylus, see ! that's blow No. 3.EU. " Silence ! behold !
the priestesses come to open the doors of Artemis' home.
Alas for the blow !
no succour thou bringest.
To me is given the right to divine heroes' conquests told by the wayside sign.
Alas for the blow !
no succour thou bringest.
"D. God bless my soul!
why, what a lot of blows.
I really think I'll go and have a bath, My groins are in such pain from all these blows.
EU.
Wait till you've heard another set of songs, Made from his verses written for the harp.
D. Well then, go on, but let's have no more blows.
EU.
How erst the youth of Hellas, Achaia's twin-throned might" Fol-lol-de-rol!
Fol-lol-de-rol! “
The sphinx, a hound that ever presideth o'er mischance ”
Fol-lol-de-rol!
Fol-lol-de-rol!
The fierce bird sendeth forth with vengeful hand and lance " Fol-lol-de-rol!
Fol-lol-de-rol! “ Giving for prey to the swift hounds that range through heaven's height" Fol-lol-de-rol!
Fol-lol-de-rol! "
The host that would have Ajax win the fight."
Fol-lol-de-rol!
Fol-lol-de-rol!D.
What's this ‘ Fol-lol-de-rol' ? from Marathon?
Where did you get that water-drawers' chant ?
AE.
At all events, from good to good I brought them, Lest it should seem that Phrynichus and I Reaped, side by side, the muses' holy mead.
This man gets songs from every little strumpet, Meletus' ballads, Carian flute-tunes, Elegies, dances, as you soon shall see.
Fetch me the lyre.
But no!
Why need we fetch A lyre for this ?
Where's she whom I can hear Playing the bones ?
Muse of Euripides, Come forth !
you'll best accompany such songs.D.
Of old she knew no Lesbian arts, not she.
AE. “
Ye kingfishers, who, by the wave E'er-flowing of ocean, chatter, And the flesh of your pinions lave With the dewy spray ye scatter;
Ye spiders, in corners 'neath the roof, Whose fingers draw the web along, Spin-in-in-inning the loom-worked woof, Care of the shuttle that trills its song, Where the flute-loving dolphin gambolled wild The dark ships' prows between;
Oracles spoken and races won, The budding vineshoots' sheen.
Around me thine elbows cast, child!
Say, do you see that foot ?D. I do.AE.
And this foot too ?D.
Yes, that foot too.
AE.
And dare you call my songs amiss,
You who composed such stuff as this, Whose lyrics of a dozen parts Remind one of Cyrene's arts ?
Such are your choral-songs, and now I mean
To show what sort of things your solos were. " O gloom of night With sable light, What send'st thou me, what dismal dream Forth from the Invisible, Servant of the Lord of Hell, Soul-less, in whom a soul doth dwell, Child of the murky night, A gruesome, fearful sight, In death's dark robes bedight, With eyes that gleam with slaughter, slaughter, And talons fell ?
Handmaids, kindle the tapers' gleam !
Fetch in your pitchers the dew from the rivers, and heat me some water, To wash the god-sent dream away.
O thou Lord of the sea!
'Tis even so.
O ye Who dwell with me here
These portents see:
Glyce hath stol'n my Chanticleer, And gone is she !
Nymphs on the mountain born !
Kitchenmaid!
hands on her lay!
There I sat at my work, ah !
wretch forlorn, Spin-in-in-inning with my hands
The spindle full of flaxen strands, Weaving a skein that early to-morrow To market I'ld bear, And barter it there.
But he, on pinion-tips so light Has fled, has fled, to heaven's height, And left me sorrow, sorrow;
And tear-drops, tear-drops, from my eyes I shed, I shed, in piteous wise.
But, Ida's children I men of Crete !
Seize your bows, and come to my aid!
Nimbly ply your legs, and meet
In a circle round my home.
And let the fair net-wielding maid Artemis, with her puppies come Through the house everywhere.
Thou too, Zeus' daughter, raise on high The twofold torchlights’ glare, In keenest hands, O Hecate !
And into Glyce's house for me Cast beams of light, that entering, I May catch the robber there !
”D. There!
stop the songs now.
AE.
Yes !
I've had enough.
For now I want to bring him to the scales, Since that alone will test our poetry, And let you see how much our verses weigh.
D.
Well, come along then, if my duty is To play cheesemonger with the Poets' art.
Well, clever folk take lots of pains !
Why, here's a most astounding thing, Newfangled, most bewildering;
'Twould puzzle anybody's brains.
By Him above !
if I had heard
The story from just any one, I should have disbelieved his word
And thought he fooled me just for fun.
D.
Come on now !
Stand beside the scales.
AE.
AND Eu. Like this ?D.
Take hold, and say your verses, each of you,
And don't let go until I call out ‘ Cuckoo'!
Now speak your verse into the scale.
EU. "
O would that Argo's barque had not flown through !
”AE. " O stream Sperchius, and the herdsmen's haunts !
”D. Cuckoo !
let go !
Why, this man's scale goes down Much lower.
EU.
But whatever is the cause ?D.
He put a stream in :
as, when men sell wool
They damp the fleeces, so he damped his verse.
But you put in a verse with wings to it.
EU. Well, let him say one more, and weigh against me.D. Take hold again, then.
AE AND EU.
So we have.
D. Say on!EU. " Persuasion hath no other shrine than speech.
"AE. " The only God men cannot bribe is Death."D. Let go !
Let go!
Down goes his scale again.
He put in Death, the heaviest of ills.
EU.
But I Persuasion, a most perfect line.D. Persuasion is a light and senseless thing:
But look out some one of your heavy lines, To weigh down well, a great and mighty one.
EU.
Where have I such a verse ?D. I'll tell you one:
­ " Achilles threw two aces and a four."
Say on !
for this is the last chance you have.
EU. "
His right hand grasped an iron-weighted club."AE. " Chariot on chariot heaped, and corpse on corpse."D. He's done you once again this time.
EU.
But how?D.
He put two chariots and two corpses in.
A hundred men of Egypt couldn't lift them.
AE.
There !
no more verse for verse !
let him get in Himself, his children, wife, Cephisophon, Jump in, sit down, and take his books as well, And I'll say just a couple of my lines.
(Enter PLUTO.)D.
The men are friends of mine:
I won't decide, For I won't be at enmity with either.
I think the one is wise :
I like the other.
PLUTO.
Then you'll do nothing that you came to do ?D.
But if I do decide?
P. Take one, and go.
The one you choose;
or else you came in vain.D.
Thank you so much.
Now, both of you attend.
I came down here to fetch a poet.D.
To save our state, and let it act its plays.
Whichever then shall give advice that's sure
To help our state, that man I mean to take.
First, what you think of Alcibiades Each tell me, for the state is in sore labour.
EU.
But what's her own opinion of him ?D.
What? " She loves, yet hates him ”—but she wants to have him.
But you must tell me what you think of him.
EU. I hate a man who to his land shall seem Slow to do good, but swift to do much harm, Helpful to self, but helpless to his state.
D. That's good I swear!
Now (to AESCHYLUS) your opinion, please.
AE.
No lion cub you in your state should rear.
Far best to rear no lion in your state, But, if you rear one, let him have his way.
D.
By all that's helpful!
I am much perplexed.
For one speaks cleverly, the other clearly.
But give me your opinion once again;
What plan of safety have you for the state ?
EU.
Tie to Cleocritus Cinesias For wings;
then winds could waft them out to sea.D.
That would be fun, but what's the sense of it ?
EU.
If a sea-fight came off, they might have cruets
Of vinegar to shower in our foe's eyes.
I've an idea I'ld like to tell.
D. Tell on.
EU.
When we put trust in what we now mistrust, Mistrusting what we trust.
D.
What do you mean ?
Say something rather stupider but clearer.
EU.
If then we should mistrust those citizens
In whom we now put trust, and use those men
Whom now we do not use, we might be saved.
If now we have ill luck with these, reversing Our present policy should surely save us.D. " A Palamedes 0 what clever wits !”
Was this your notion, or Cephisophon's ?
EU.
My own idea:
the vinegar was his.
D. (to AESCHYLUS) Now your views, please.
AE.
First tell me of the state:
Whom does she use ?
Good men ?D.
Why, what a question!
She hates them bitterly.
AE.
And likes the bad ?D.
Not she !
she uses them because she must.
AE. "
Then how can any one save such a state," Which wants a coat that's neither thick nor thin ?D.
Find out, if you come back again some day.
AE.
There I could tell you, here I'ld rather not.D. O don't say that!
send up what's good from here.
AE.
When they shall hold the country of their foes
To be their own, and their own land the foe's,
The ships as income, income as outgoing,D. Good, but that feeds none but the juryman!
P.
Won't you decide ?D. I'll give my verdict thus :
— "
Him will I choose in whom my soul delights.”EU.
Remember now the Gods by whom you swore.
You'ld surely take me home, and choose your friend.
D. "
My tongue hath sworn, but ” . . .
Aeschylus I'll choose.
EU.
What have you done, most vile of men ?D.
What?
I ?
I've given Aeschylus the prize.
Why not ?EU.
What!
do such wrong and look me in the face ?D. "
What's wrong, unless the " audience " think it so ?
”EU.
What!
cruel wretch !
look on and leave me dead ?D. "
Who knows if life is nothing else but death," Breathing a breakfast, sleep a nappy quilt ?P. Come in now, both, please, Dionysus.P.
To be my guests before you start.
D. Good news!
I know I don't object to such a plan.
CHORUS.
How happy is the man of sense
And accurate intelligence.
This may by many proofs be learned, For by good sense this man has earned
The right to go back home again, A blessing to his countrymen, A blessing to his kith and kin, Such privilege could wisdom win.
And so, the proper way to please
Is not to sit with Socrates, And learn to chatter, passing by The science of true poetry, And giving up the grandest part Of tragedy's ennobling art;
For idly wasting all one's days
In learning words of grand pretence, And scraps of philosophic craze, Proclaims a man bereft of sense.
P.
And now I bid you a hearty good-bye, Friend Aeschylus !
go and save our land
By good advice.
Lay a heavy hand
On fools-of whom there's a large supply-
And take this present to Cleophon, And this to that Financier-crew, Give Myrmex and Nicomachus one, And here's one for Archenomus too.
And bid them make haste, every man,
And come to me here as fast as they can, If they don't make haste, just let them know, I'll brand them and fetter their legs together, And speedily send them down below, With Adeimantus, the son of White-feather.
AE.
So will I do, but as for my throne Let Sophocles take it, and sit thereon
To keep it for me, in case some day I come here again, for he, I say, In our art is the next to me.
But mind that master of villainy, False-tongued and full of buffoonery, Never once my seat may fill, No, not even against his will.
P. Kindle the holy torches' ray And lead him upwards on his way.
With tune and metre alike his own, Let all honour be duly done.
First let us join in a hearty farewell to the poet who leaves us Speeding away to the light, ye Gods in the nether-world dwelling, Sending our country a hearty good wish for the good time that's coming.
Thus shall we wholly be freed from all of our terrible troubles, Freed from war's pitiful strife, but if Cleophon must go a fighting, He and the rest of his kidney can fight in the fields of their fathers.

DIONYSUS, who appears in this play disguised, as he thinks, as Heracles, wears a woman's yellow dress and slippers, under a lion- skin, and carries a heavy club.
He is the typical Athenian 'man-in­ the-street', hardly less ignorant than such characters in our own country, and quite as ready to give his worthless opinion upon every subject.
His slave bears the common slave-name Xanthias (i. e. ‘Sandy' or ‘ Carrots'), derived from the colour of his hair.

The jokes made for the amusement of the' Gallery, which are here ridiculed, were very commonly employed by comedians, and not rarely by Aristophanes himself.
14. Phrynichus, a contemporary comedian, gained the Second prize against the Frogs, and Ameipsias the First prize against the Birds, and the Second against the Clouds.
Lycis is unknown.
22. 4 Son of ... Cask' (or wine-jar), an unexpected substitute for Son of Zeus.
Dionysus was the God of Wine.25-30.
These lines are a skit upon the quibbling disputations common among the disciples of the Sophists.
33. ' That sea-fight.'
The battle of Arginusae, in which slaves were employed as well as citizens, and rewarded with their freedom.
48. Cleisthenes, see below, 1. 428, is frequently satirized by Aristophanes for his vice and effeminacy.
Nothing else is known about him.
52. The Andromeda by Euripides, produced in 412 B. C., has not survived.
It was considered one of his finest tragedies.
55. Melon is said to have been a tragic actor of great size.
73.
Iophon, son of Sophocles, a successful tragedian, appears from this passage to have owed some of his success to his produc­ ing works of Sophocles as his own.
Not long before his father's death, he was afraid that he would be disinherited in favour of his nephew, Sophocles the younger, and tried to prove in Court that his father was of unsound mind;
but to meet the charge, Sophocles merely read a passage from his latest work, Oedipus at Colonus, which had not yet been produced, and at once gained the day.
Sophocles, at the age of 27, defeated Aeschylus, in 468 B.C., winning the first prize for tragedy, and held the stage till 441, when he was defeated by Euripides.
Only seven of his 130 plays are extant:
many critics consider them to be the finest dramatic pro­ ductions in the Greek language.
He died at the age of 90, the year before the Frogs was acted.
83. Agathon, the tragedian, was highly esteemed by Socrates and Plato.
His first success was in 416.
He was celebrated for his beauty, but is satirized by Aristophanes, in the Thesmophoria­ zusae, for his effeminacy, and is said to have left Athens for the Court of King Aechelaus of Macedon in 407, immediately after our author attacked him in the Gerytades (now lost).
86. Xenocles, the smallest of an undersized family, defeated Euripides in 415.
He is ridiculed by Aristophanes in other plays, and by other comedians.
87. Pythangelus, of whom nothing is known, has had ‘2,500 years of immortality', as Professor Gilbert Murray puts it, owing to this mention of his name.
100.
These expressions, so much admired by Dionysus, occur in three of Euripides' plays :
- The Melanippe, the Alexander, and the Hippolytus.124.
Compulsory suicide, by hemlock-drinking, was a common form of execution at Athens.128.
Words with a termination equivalent to -live were largely employed in the philosophical jargon of the day, and are common in Plato's works.
In the Knights (1.1378, &c.) we find 6 quoted in three lines, provoking the suggestion ' Can't you be kickative of the talkative ?’
[This last word, compounded of the only Lithua­ nian word in our language (see Skeat) and Latin, is at least as barbarous as 'walkative129.
The Cerameicus, or Potters' Quarter of Athens, was the scene of the Torch-races (see 1. 1091).
The high tower is said to have been built by the celebrated misanthrope, Timon of Athens.
134.
Dionysus, with perhaps mock humility, calls the two lobes of his brain ' a couple of rissoles'.
140.
The proper fare was I½d., but the war had made things so much dearer that to go to Hades cost as much as to go to the Play, Charon's boat was proverbially small:
Heracles suggests that he could hold it in one hand.
142.
Theseus, the hero of the Athenian constitution, visited Hades with Peirithous to carry off Persephone, but was imprisoned there till Heracles rescued him.
He seems to have parted with some threepenny-pieces during his imprisonment.
151.
Morsimus the oculist, a relative of Aeschylus, is ridiculed elsewhere by Aristophanes as a most inferior tragedian.
153.
Cinesias, mentioned again 1. 367, was an inferior dithy­ rambic poet of the innovating school of music, noted for his spindle shanks and feeble body.
He is criticized unfavourably by four other writers, including Plato.159.
Xanthias says that the joys just mentioned by Heracles will be about as much joy to him as a donkey feels when he walks in a procession, heavily laden.
178.
The dead man naturally substitutes sooner would I live!
for ‘ sooner would I die!'184.
Dionysus hails Charon with a pun on his name, repeated three times, which cannot well be rendered into English.
186.
Asses’-Shearington=the land of Nowhere.
A cavern at Taenarum, S.W. of Laconia, was supposed to be one of the entrances of Hades.
Charon's question may mean, Who's for Hell or Sparta?
they're the same thing.
'191.
'To gain his freedom' (see 11. 33, 693) is possibly the mean­ ing of an expression about which commentators have written a great deal that is not very convincing.
194.
Xanthias has so small an opinion of Charon's rowing that he expects to get round the lake before the boat gets across it.
196.
Xanthias refers to some harbinger of ill-omen that must have crossed his path unnoticed.
204.
The men of Salamis, separated from Attica by only a few miles of sea, were noted for their seamanship.
215.
Nysa was apparently a name given to any mountain on which Dionysus was worshipped, in any country in the world.
218. See p. 95.232.
The bridge of the lyre was often made of reed.
251.
Dionysus has probably altered a terrifying shout or yell by way of parodying the croaking of the Frogs.
(See 1. 262.)272.
Xanthias, though he has got there first, has lost his wind.
293.
The Greek Bogey was able to change into all sorts of things.
Her mule's (or donkey's) leg, which seems to have outlasted her changes on this occasion, is described by Xanthias with a slave's natural coarseness.
297.
The Priest of Dionysus sat in the middle of the front row of the stalls, as we should call them.
It is really Aristophanes himself who thus tells the Priest that he hopes to win the prize for his play, and come to the supper which the Priest gave to the successful competitors after the performance.
303. Hegelochus, while acting the name-part in Euripides' play Orestes (1. 279), mispronounced the word that means ‘calm' and turned it into the equivalent of weasel’.
I have used ' weasel for ‘we shall' in my translation.
318. See p. 94.320.
In this line the reading is very uncertain.
I follow the interpretation of Professor Tucker, in his edition of this play, published in 1906.338.
Pigs were sacrificed at the mysteries.
357.
Cratinus (here called the ‘beef-eater', a title properly belonging to Dionysus himself), a most successful poet of the Old Comedy, who defeated Aristophanes in his 96th year (423), is satirized by our author and others for his drunken habits, but praised most highly for his productions.
363.
Aegina, about 12 miles from the coast of Attica, though a very small island, was once an important state.
Since 431 it had belonged to Athens, and was occupied by Athenians, the native population being expelled.
Thorycion (see 1. 381) is nowhere else mentioned.
364. Epidaurus, the nearest port opposite Aegina, was a station of the Peloponnesian fleet in 411.
Perhaps the treacherous smuggling here mentioned began then, and was continued till the date of this play.
367.
Little shrines, statues, and emblems of Hecate were placed at many of the crossways.
The person here referred to is probably Cinesias (see 1. 153).378. ' The Saviour' was a common title of Persephone.
She, Demeter, and Iacchus were the deities of these mysteries.
404.
The ‘ torn clothes and split shoes' were the proper dress for those taking part in these processions.
They were not neces­ sarily old and ludicrous, and it is probable that Aristophanes does not really mean, as some suppose, that his chorus is shabbily dressed.
416. (See p. 94.)
Archedemus 1the sore-eyed' (see 1. 588) was the originator of the prosecution of the Admirals after Arginusae.
He was guilty of embezzlement and bribery, but is here attacked as not being a genuine Athenian.
The Marquess of Salisbury's sneer at ‘ the black man' represents very fairly the attitude of Aristophanes and the majority of the Athenians towards aliens (see 1. 679).
There is a poor and impossible pun in the next line in the original.
428.
Cleistbenes' lover Sebinus has a name which may be real, but its meaning is so grossly indecent that it is probably altered for the purpose of ridicule, like Hippobinus (really Hipponicus) in the next line.
429.
Callias, who wasted an immense fortune in debauchery, appears in the Birds as a hoopoe with hardly a feather left him, after being plucked by toadies and harlots.
463.
Aeacus, who here acts as Pluto's door-keeper, and later on shows himself to be a rascally slave, was, according to the popular theology, one of the judges in Hades.
His speech is said to be parodied from a tragedy of Euripides, in which it is addressed to Heracles.
The ‘ lamprey of Tartessus', here made so terrible, was a great dainty.
The ‘ Gorgons of Teithras' are the women of one of the demes (or districts) of Attica.501.
' Melite's... bad lot' is a surprise for ' Melite's great hero*;
Heracles had a temple here.
541.
Theramenes (see 1. 968) has the character of being a trimmer in politics.
After Arginusae, where he commanded a ship, he appears to have escaped prosecution by accusing his colleagues.
Aristotle calls him an admirable statesman, but his fellow-citizens called him ‘ the boot that fits either foot549.
Rogers tells us that the Greek dentists of later date called a row of teeth a ' chorus ’.556.
There is some humour in the suggestion that Dionysus, in the character of Heracles, thought he had disguised himself success­ fully by wearing ladies' shoes.
567.
The ‘ rugs' here mentioned were used as bedding.
569.
Cleon, a rich tanner, is represented by Aristophanes and Thucydides as a vulgar and brutal demagogue.
He was, in the early years of the war, a strong opponent of peace, and in 425 his popularity with the lower class was greatly increased by his taking prisoner a body of Spartans, many of them being of high birth, in the island of Sphacteria, which had been blockaded fruitlessly for some months.
His success was largely due to the accidental burning of the woods on the island.
He was thus enabled to fulfil his boast that, if he were general, he would take the place within a few days.
He fell in battle three years later.
Aristophanes, whom he attempted to deprive of his rights of citizenship, attacks him on every possible occasion, and wrote the Knights on purpose to injure him in his public character, but without much success.
He is here represented as being patron or protector of the lower orders in Hades, as he had been on earth.
Grote and other radical writers think that his contemporaries have grossly slandered him.
570.
Hyperbolus, a lampseller, attacked also in the Knights, was a demagogue of the same type.
He was ostracised and went to Samos, where he was murdered by his political enemies in 411.574.
The Pit was a ravine outside Athens into which criminals and the dead bodies of executed persons were thrown.
587.
Dionysus' wife and family are of course imaginary.
608.
Aeacus calls three Scythian archers (policemen) to help the two slaves for whom Xanthias with his club has proved too much.
The police in Athens appear to have been always foreigners (see 1. 1356) and generally Scythians.615.
Xanthias turns the tables on Dionysus, who is enjoying his discomfiture, by availing himself of the right to offer his slave for torture, to prove the falseness of the charge of misdoings on a former occasion.
621.
It was usual to ask that no undue severity might be employed.
Xanthias asks that there may be no undue lenity.
646. Dionysus, in his pretended unconcern at the blow, 'goes one better' than Xanthias, and asks, 'At what o'clock do you mean to begin ?’
No explanation of his question about his sneezing is satisfactory.
We simply don't know what it means, and may as well say so.
650.
The festival of Heracles at Diomeia had not been kept for a long time, owing to the occupation of Attica by the enemy.
654.
The cavalry (knights) when on service carried their pro­ visions, including onions, themselves.
Dionysus, pointing to the knights in the audience, says, 4 These men have brought their onions with them.'657.
Xanthias makes his cry of pain change into a quotation, probably from Sophocles' play Odysseus Acanthoplex, in which the hero is dangerously wounded by a spine-fish.
659.
Dionysus follows suit with a similarly-used quotation from Ananius, his attempt to remember the words of Hipponax being unsuccessful.
This quotation was probably most familiar to all the audience, and Dionysus' mistake is something like crediting Longfellow with some well-known verses of Tennyson's.
The two Greek poets were contemporaries (about 540).
665.
This passage is said to occur in Sophocles' Laocoon, and to be incorrectly quoted.
678.
Cleophon, a demagogue of the most offensive type, and the most violent opponent of peace on all occasions, is here attacked not for his faults, but for his un-Athenian origin, as Archedemus was (see 1. 416).
684.
The meaning of this line is not perfectly clear, but the prophecy came true.
He was murdered before the year was ended.
689.
The Phrynichus here mentioned was an important factor in the revolution of 411, by which the oligarchy of the 400 was established.
After four months it was overthrown, and its supporters disfranchised.
This passage led to their restoration, at the end of the year, to citizenship, and this speech of the Chorus secured the first prize for Aristophanes.
693.
After Plataea was destroyed (427) by the Peloponnesians, its citizens were rewarded for their long loyalty to Athens by being made Athenian citizens with full rights.
708.
Cleigenes is nowhere else mentioned.
The soap supplied by the ‘ Lords of Cimolia' was a clay used for this purpose, which they appear to have adulterated with cheap and inferior substances.
Cimolia is one of the Cyclades.718.
The copper or bronze coinage which is here considered to be the type of the alien, inferior, and vulgar politicians and officials of the day, had been almost literally ‘ coined a day or two ago' and contrasted most unfavourably with the 'old-fashioned coinage' of silver, and the 4 gold of recent date', both of which, as may be seen from existing specimens, were of exceptional excellence.
The old coins probably represent the good old Tories, middle-aged or elderly, and the new gold the younger men who followed in their footsteps, and were not, in Aristophanes' opinion, adulterated by the philosophy of the Sophists or the ' radical' innovations of the favourites of the mob.733.
Two 4 scapegoats a man and a woman, generally criminals of the worst kind, were scourged out of the city and put to death at the festival of the Phargelia in May, to take away the sins of the nation.
737.
An optimistic proverb says that to be hanged on a goodly tree is better than being hanged on an inferior one.
745.
Aeacus compares his feelings to those of the highest rank of the Initiate, who were as absolutely certain of salvation as some of our 4 converted people.
756. ' Patron of jailbirds' is a surprise for A patron of brother­ hood • or ‘ kinship'.
758.
Aeschylus (525-456), author of seventy plays of which seven are extant, won the first prize for tragedy in 484.
Being defeated by Sophocles in 468, he retired to the court of King Hiero of Syracuse.
Ten years later he was in Athens for a short time, and produced the Agamemnon, Choephoroe, and Eumenides.
He died in Sicily two years later.
He improved tragedy by intro­ ducing a second actor and making dialogue possible, and by using better scenery and costumes.
The grandeur of his style is unequalled, but the criticisms of Euripides in this play scarcely exaggerate his grandiloquence and obscurity.
764.
Citizens who rendered conspicuous services to the state were similarly honoured at Athens.791.
Cleidemides, of whom nothing is known, is supposed to have been an actor in Sophocles' tragedies, or a politician given to 'sitting on the fence '.799.
There is here an allusion to the mechanical accuracy and minute regularity of Euripides' verses compared with the more rugged style of Aeschylus.807.
Professor Tucker is probably right in holding that this refers to the political views of Aeschylus, which were aristo­ cratical.
813.
This chorus, describing the character of the coming battle, seems to consist of parody, imitation, and quotation.
It foretells a contest between strength and subtlety.
837. Euripides' charge against Aeschylus, of introducing 'savages' in his plays, is met by the counter-charge of introducing ‘ beggars' and cripples’.
840.
With the exception of the word ' greengrocer' this line is one of Euripides' own.
847.
The sacrifice of a black lamb was customary to avert a threatening storm.
849.
Euripides, in two plays dealing with Crete, introduced love-songs dealing with unholy passion, about which he wrote also in his Aeolus and other dramas.
854.
A ' topping' word probably means one that hits you on the top of the head.
855. ' Telephus' is put as a surprise for brains.
Euripides evidently considered this play as the finest work of his brain.
868. Aeschylus' plays, he says, have outlived him, and are still in the world above.
871.
On such occasions as the present trial, 'the proceedings were opened with prayer.'886.
Aeschylus, born at Eleusis, and initiated into the Mysteries, claims the patronage of Demeter.890.
The reference here is to the contemptible 'new coinage' (see 1. 725).910.
The Phrynichus here mentioned is the poet (see 11. 14 and 1299).918.
Dionysus, vexed at having wrongly admired Aeschylus' treatment of dumb characters, now pettily and spitefully calls him '
What's-his-name ?'925.
Euripides charges Aeschylus with using big noisy words and descriptions of war with its ' Death-or-Glory-Boys' and their accoutrements and heraldic devices and crests.
932.
This bird, who appears in other plays of Aristophanes, is supposed to be a macaw, a cockatoo, or a turkey-cock.939.
Tragedy is here represented by Euripides as an over­ corpulent lady, whom he, as physician, attended with beneficial results.
944.
Cephisophon, an actor who lived with Euripides, was said to have helped him with his plays (see I. 1438), and seduced his wife (see 1. 1048).952.
Euripides' profession of Liberalism appears to have been insincere, if he ever made it outside this play, which is unlikely.
963.
Cycnus and Memnon were demigods who fought on Priam's side in the Trojan war.965.
Megaenetus is unknown.
His nickname may have been something like ‘ the Ninepin'.
In the game called Cottabos, a small bronze statuette was called by this nickname of his.
Phormisius was evidently a much-bearded and moustached man.
A bearer of this name was an honest politician of the old school, who came into prominence at the time of the fall of Athens (403).966.
The robber Sinis used to tie his prisoners to the bent-down heads of two pine-trees, and let the trees fly up and tear the man in two.
He suffered the same fate at the hands of Theseus.967.
Cleitophon was associated with Theramenes in the revolu­ tion which led to the establishment of the Four Hundred (411).
Euripides' claiming him as a disciple is in direct contradiction to 1. 952.970.
' Coan, not Chian.'
The meaning of this is not clear.
It sounds like a proverb :
if so, it must be an old one, which survived its application.
The Chians, until they revolted in 412, were most devoted to the Athenian cause, in return for which they were specially mentioned in treaties, public prayers, &c., and, as a character in the Birds says, tacked on everywhere.'
Possibly the name 4 Chian' came to be considered the equivalent of loyal and honest friend', and this signification outlived the disloyalty of its bearers.
The Coans belonged to the Carian race.
A proverb tells us that ‘ three C's', the Carians, the Cappadocians, and the Cilicians are ‘thoroughly bad’.
Possibly the Coans were the worst-liked Carians, just as the Chians had been the best-liked Ionians.
Some MSS.
call Theramenes a Cean, and commentators have supposed that he really was one ;
but if'he had not been an Athenian, Aristophanes would have taken good care to say so.
There are many other explanations of this passage ;
possibly all wrong, as mine may be ;
certainly none of them more satisfactory.992.
A quotation from the Myrmidons of Aeschylus.1005.
The chorus consider Tragedy to have been mere ' prating' till Aeschylus raised its tone.
1012.
The humour of this lies in its impossibility.
1017.
The shield of Ajax was made seven-ox-hides thick.
1021.
This play, The Seven against Thebes, has survived, as also the Persae (1. 1026).1028.
The death of Darius is not reported in our version of the play, but his ghost appears.
1032.
No genuine writings of Orpheus and Musaeus have survived, but we still have Hesiod's Works and Days.1037.
Pantocles, a lyric poet, gained the nick-name Clumsy from this.
He was taking part in a procession, when he remembered that he had not put the plume on his helmet, and made an attempt to fix it on from the outside.
As it had to be fastened in its place from the inside, he was not successful.
1040.
Lamachus died in the Sicilian expedition.
Before this Aristopbanes constantly attacked him, owing to his persistent op­ position to proposals of peace.
1043.
Phaedra was enamoured of her stepson.
Sthenoboea behaved to Bellerophon as the wife of Potiphar did to Joseph.
Euripides wrote two plays about each of them.
1048.
Euripides had two wives, both unfaithful.
1051.
No satisfactory explanation of this incredible statement can be given.1065.
A rich Athenian might be called upon to equip a ship for the navy, if his means were sufficient.
1068.
The fish-market was frequented by the gourmands and gourmets of Athens.1080.
In his Auge and his Aeolus, Euripides has dealt with these things.
1081.
This expression occurs in his Phrixus and his Polyides.1096.
It was the regular and recognized custom for the Potter­ folk to quicken up the slowest runners in the Torch-race in this way.
The Panathenaea was the greatest of all the festivals of Athens.
Its amusements included games and sports of every description.
1114.
It is uncertain what book the spectators had.
It is impos­ sible that all, or even most of them, can have possessed a copy of the play, even if we do not believe that the theatre held 50,000 persons.
Enough MS.
copies could not have been made between the first and the second performances, supposing these words to have been introduced in the second edition.
But some work on the drama generally may have been lately published and widely read.
1124.
See note, 1. 758, for the plays referred to :
the quotation which follows is from the second of them.
The language is almost as obscure as Euripides asserts.
1144.
Hermes and other gods had as many attributes and functions as those assigned to Our Lady.
1148.
Dionysus' unsavoury joke, as Aeschylus considers it, saves Aristophanes the trouble of finishing what might have been an unconvincing criticism.
1159.
Instead of asking for a couple of kneading-troughs straight out, the borrower calls them by two different names, identical in meaning.1163 and 1174.
Such tautology, familiar to us from its frequent occurrence in our Book of Common Prayer, is generally considered emphatic and not blameworthy.
1182.
This is from the Antigone of Euripides.
1195.
Dionysus pretends to think that Oedipus may have been one of the six admirals executed after Arginusae, as lucky then as ever, if Euripides' idea of luck is right.
1202.
It is not easy to see the point of the ‘ tacking on of the oil­ flask which will fit many of the prologues of Aeschylus and Sopho­ cles equally well.
It is very probably not meant to be a fair, but only an amusing, attack on Euripides.
The plays quoted are :
1206, &c. The Archelaus, the Hypsipyle, the Sthenoboea, the Phrixus, the Iphigeneia in Tauris, the Meleager, and the Me­ lanippe.1248.
The criticism of the Lyric poetry is directed against the music rather than the style or language.
The same is true of Aeschylus' criticisms of Euripides' lyrics.1264, &c.
The plays quoted are the Myrmidons, the Psychagogoe, the Telephus (or the Iphigeneia), the Hiereiae, and the Agamem­ non.
The refrain, which makes sense in the first passage, becomes as meaningless as Calverley's Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese', afterwards.1285, &c.
The plays quoted here are the Agamemnon, the Sphinx, the Agamemnon again, an unknown play, and the Thressae.
The meaning and the appropriateness (or the opposite) of the refrain are absolutely undiscoverable.
1299.
The music of Phrynichus was too tuneful and melodious to suit the stern style of Aeschylus.
1302.
Meletus, one of the chief accusers of Socrates, wrote drinking-songs, erotic ballads, and very inferior tragedies.
1305.
An ugly and very unattractive woman with big ill-shaped feet is heard playing the equivalent of the bones, and now enters.
1308.
The Lesbian courtesans were noted for their unbridled lasciviousness, as well as for their fascinations.1309, &c.
The following passage consists of quotations from Euripides' plays, strung together irrespective of the sense, and sung to his music, shakes and all.
We have one of these shakes on the impossible sound of a short ‘ i', in the word ' spinning' (repeated in 1. 1349).
1322.
Euripides has made a false quantity, which I have repre­ sented by ĕlbōws.
Aeschylus refers to this ‘ foot', and pointing to the muse's ill-shaped ‘ beetle-crusher * implies that they are a good match.
1327.
Cyrene was a courtesan who outdid all others in the variety of her lascivious accomplishments.
1331.
The following monody is not by any means an unfair parody of the style of Euripides.
In it a housewife tells how she had a terrible dream, which came true, about her neighbour making a raid upon her fowlhouse, and stealing her pet rooster.
1340.
Purification after an ill-omened dream was resorted to, in the hope that what it foretold might be averted.
1356.
The police (who were archers) are here called in, in heroic language, and Artemis, goddess of the chase, is invoked to help them, as is Hecate, to whom the night is as clear as the day1364.
The testing verses by weight is of course meant to be mere playing to the gallery.
Euripides' chance was gone, as Rogers suggests, as soon as he had relieved tragedy of its weight (see 1. 941).1374.
Some scrupulous folk omitted the name of any god in their conversational oaths.
Compare the French ‘ sacré’, and our ‘ 0 my’.1382.
The plays from which the rivals quote are :
the Medea, the Antigone, and the Meleager of Euripides, and the Philoctetes, the Niobe, and the Glaucus Potnieus of Aeschylus.
The line Dionysus suggests is from the Telefihus.
1406.
There was no doubt some proverb about the weight-lifting powers of the Egyptians, inferred, as Merry suggests, from their buildings.
1413.
Commentators are about equally divided as to who is ‘ clever' and who is ‘ liked'.
There is the same uncertainty in 1. 1434.1419.
The fall of Athens would mean the death of the drama, which was an essential part of the Greek worship.
1422.
Alcibiades was now living in retirement in Thrace, where he had an estate.
He had been one of the generals appointed to conduct the Sicilian expedition (415) but was at once recalled, on a charge of impiety, when he reached Sicily, and as he did not return, he was exiled.
He joined the Spartan side, but was recalled at the time of the ' Four Hundred' by their opponents, and in 408 was at the head of the army and navy, and practically dictator.
In 406 the Athenian fleet was defeated at Notium, during his un­ justifiable absence, and he was deprived of his command, and went to his estate in voluntary banishment;
1. 1425 Exactly describes the attitude of Athens towards him.
His brilliant genius made him as dangerous as a foe as he was helpful as a friend, and there was a very strong feeling in favour of his recall, which no doubt Aristo­ phanes shared, but preferred to let the audience express their opinion about it.
Euripides is opposed to it;
Aeschylus says ‘ make the best of a bad bargain’.
1437.
Euripides' serious counsel having fallen flat, he offers a suggestion intended to be ridiculous, out of pique, and acknow­ ledges later (1. 1433) that he is not responsible for it.
Cleocritus was a big clumsy ostrich-like man, and Cinesias a skinny, frail, dwarf.1443.
The ridiculous plan having also fallen flat, he gives advice as ambiguous as the answer of an oracle, which in Greek must have sounded even less intelligible than in English;
so he has to explain it (1. 1446, &c.).1451.
The proverbial cleverness of Palamedes made Odysseus so jealous that he caused his death.1459, &c.
These lines probably belong to the second edition of the play, and were substituted for others, as the audience, when the play was first performed, did not take the bait Aristophanes offered them, and pronounce definitely upon Alcibiades' recall.
Aeschylus, speaking for him, says that Athens is past praying for, and that the stage is no longer the place for the expression of political opinions, at such a crisis:
but, when further entreated by Dionysus to suggest some way out of this hopeless condition, he falls back upon the well-known advice of Pericles, given at the beginning of the war, which resembled the modem cry :
'Spend your last penny on your navy.'1466.
Dionysus says that it is easy enough to spend your last penny, but not so easy to see that the navy gets it, when 6,000 jurors must first be paid.
1467.
Some say this is a quotation from Euripides;
others, with greater probability, that it is from some game played by children.
1475.
In the Aeolus of Euripides this line occurs with 'doers' in the place of' audience 1482.
It is most unlikely that Euripides belonged at any time to the Socratic circle, but Aristophanes looks upon Socrates as a teacher of the same new-fangled political and religious opinions as Euripides.
1504.
A rope is sent, for Cleophon to hang himself:
the same, or other instruments of suicide, to the Board of Finance, appointed to raise money after the Sicilian expedition.
Mynnex and Arche­ nomus are unknown.
Nicomachus is attacked in an oration of Lysias, for embezzlement of public money.
1514.
Adeimantus, a general who shared command with Alcibiades in 407, was held reponsible through treachery for the Athenian defeat at Aegospotami in 404, which caused the fall of Athens.
His title ' son of White-Feather' does not, in the original, imply cowardice.

These closing hexameters and, according to some commen­ tators, certain expressions quoted in them, are intended to recall the style of Aeschylus.
In the part taken by the Chorus we have an imitation of some of the ritual, &c., observed in the Eleusinian mysteries, religious ceremonies of the most venerable nature, dating back far into pre­ historic times, and derived, some say, from Egypt, the cradle of sacred mysteries.
They were celebrated twice a year, and were of two degrees of importance, the greater Eleusinia being held at Athens and Eleusis (10 miles distant), in September, the lesser at Agrae, in the environs of the city, in March.
Professor Tucker has shown, with almost absolute certainty, that the latter are repre­ sented in this play.
The Chorus is composed of those who were initiated at this Festival, the ceremony including the sacrifice of a pig, ritual washings, ceremonial purifications, the taking of an oath of secrecy, and certain services of instruction;
it was regarded as introductory to the higher initiation at the Greater Festival.
The representation, beginning at line 324, and ending at line 460, opens with a Hymn to Iacchus, 324-52, while the pig is (in imagination) being sacrificed (1. 338).
Then follows an imitation of the customary warning to the unholy and uninitiated to withdraw, literary and political offenders being substituted for these trans­ gressors.
Three hymns are then sung, the first (372-81) in honour of Persephone, the second (384-93) addressed to Demeter, and the last (398-413) a processional hymn to Iacchus, supposed to be sung on the way to the shrine of his mother Demeter.
Though lacchus is also called Dionysus, he is not identical with the Dionysus who is one of the characters in this play, and who was the son of Semele.
The procession halts at an imaginary bridge, to reproduce the customary topical songs', which dealt with public characters with an unrestrained licence and a freedom of abuse unfamiliar to us, and probably (as Professor Tucker says of Greek abuse in general) meaning nothing in particular, but used in a ‘ Pickwickian sense’.
These jokes at the Bridge were said to have been originally made by some one (Iambe or Baubo), who when Demeter, heartbroken at the loss of her daughter Persephone, sat weeping at the bridge over the Cephisus, in Attica, tried to make her laugh by jokes of this kind.
At line 449 the women who have joined in this pageant pass out of the theatre, and the men remain to fill the part of the regular chorus in the play.
These Lesser Mysteries were connected with the annual festival Anthesteria, held in honour of Dionysus about a month after this play was brought out.
The festival lasted for three days, which were called ' The Broaching of the Casks ’,‘ The Cups ’, and ' The Pitchers'.
The second day was devoted to drinking, from the effects of which those who, on the third day, offered pitchers or pots full of flowers, vegetables, &c., still suffered when they came to worship (see line 218).
It has been conjectured that the second performance of this play took place at this festival.
