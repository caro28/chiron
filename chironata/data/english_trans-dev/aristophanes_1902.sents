THE Ecclesiazusae has come down to us unaccompanied by any didascalia or other evidence of its date, beyond what may be gathered from the play itself and the comments of the Greek Scholiasts thereon.
But the information derivable from these sources makes it abundantly clear that the play was exhibited in the spring of the year B.C. 393, in the third year of the 96th Olympiad, when Eubulides was archon.
In the opening scenes of the comedy, the women, disguised as men, are practising the part which they are shortly to play in the Assembly, ἐκκλησία, of the Athenian people.
And Praxagora, their leader, delivers a speech of considerable length, in the serious part of which she is doubtless expounding the poet's own views respecting the political condition of Athens.
She arraigns the policy of the people for its total want of continuity;
she avers that they are perpetually chopping and changing;
enamoured of one course to-day, and of the opposite course to-morrow;
and in illustration of her statement, she says:
" Then again this Alliance, when we were deliberating about it, they vowed that not to conclude it would be the ruin of the State:
but when once it was concluded, they were disgusted with it;
and the orator who persuaded them into it had straightway to cut and run.”
Lines 193-196.
On this passage the Scholiasts remark, περὶ του̑ συμμαχικου̑, φιλόχορος ίστορεȋ on πρὸ δύο ἐτω̑ν ἐγένετο συμμαχία Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Βοιωτω̑ν. “
As to the Alliance, Philochorus relates that, two years before, an Alliance had been concluded between the Lacedaemonians and the Boeotians."
But as the speaker is referring to an alliance entered into not by the Lacedaemonians, but by the Athenians, Petit has, with general consent, substituted Ἀθηναίων for Λακεδαιμονίων in the Scholium.
And that this is really what the Scholiasts meant is made still plainer by the circumstance that the orator who fell into discredit for pushing the treaty through is by them (on line 196) declared, however wrongly, to have been the illustrious officer Conon, the inveterate enemy of the Lacedaemonians.
We get therefore so far that, according to the statement in the Scholium, the Ecclesiazusae was acted two years after an alliance had been contracted between the Athenians and the Boeotians, an alliance which was considered of momentous, and even of vital, importance to Athens :
and that with this alliance the name of Conon was, or might have been, in some way connected.
And we have next to consider whether we find in history, within the period admissible for the production of this play, any treaty of alliance between the Athenians and the Boeotians which will answer the foregoing conditions.
Now the disastrous termination of the Peloponnesian War not only annihilated the Athenian empire, it reduced Athens herself to the position of a mere satellite and dependency of the Spartan leadership.
The Athenians1 were bound to follow wherever Sparta might lead ;
her enemies were to be their enemies, and her friends their friends;
their navy was limited to twelve triremes;
and the demolition of the Long Walls left them open at once to a blockade by the formidable armies of the Peloponnesian Confederacy.
In this state of humiliation Athens remained for about nine years, from B. c. 404 to B. c. 395.
Yet at the very moment of her fall an undercurrent was working which was ultimately to lift her, not indeed to her former supremacy, but to a position of dignity and complete independence.
At the time when Athens lay helpless at the feet of her conquerors, a great congress was held at Sparta for the purpose of deciding upon her fate.
Many states, and more especially Thebes and Corinth, were urgent that no terms of any kind should be granted her;
insisting that the city should be razed, and all the citizens sold into slavery;
and that sheep should pasture over the ground which once was Athens.
The Lacedaemonians stood resolutely between Athens and this terrible vengeance, declaring that they would not reduce to slavery an Hellenic city, a city too which had done such splendid service for Hellas in the hour of her gravest peril.
And, overruling the eager hostility of the most powerful members of the Confederacy, they granted the terms of peace which have already been mentioned 1.
No moment in all Hellenic history after the great Persian invasion was so noble as this, when Sparta saw her great antagonist prostrate at her feet, forgot the bitter rivalry of the last seven and twenty years, remembered only their comradeship in the death-struggle against the Mede, remembered the gallantry and self-devotion of Athens in those heroic days, and proved herself a worthy representative of the men of Thermopylae and Plataea.
Not a life was taken;
no Athenian was injured in purse or person;
no trophies, not even the Spartan shields captured at Sphacteria, were reclaimed, but Athens was left with all her wealth of architecture and sculpture, with all her art-treasures, and temples, and choruses ;
still an " eye" of Hellas, still the noblest and the loveliest of all Hellenic cities.
The spirit of the dead Callicratidas must have been strong in the Spartan councils on that day, when the Peloponnesian War was closed with this great act of forbearance and magnanimity.
And yet, though it displayed Sparta for the moment as the true Pan-Hellenic leader, though it invested her with a claim to our admiration even surpassing what is clue to her military glories, it undoubtedly sowed the bitter seed which culminated in her own downfall.
Thebes and Corinth, the main props of the Confederacy which acknow­ ledged the leadership of Sparta, were naturally aggrieved to find their fondest wishes overruled, and their hostility to Athens rebuked, by the generous moderation of the Spartan decision.
And very shortly after­ wards the Thebans 1 certainly, and according to Justin the Corinthians -also, received a further rebuff from Sparta:
their claim to share in the wealth which Lysander had brought from Asia for the more effectual prosecution of the war being absolutely repudiated by the Spartan government.
Thenceforward they began to draw away from her side.
And in the following year when Sparta again summoned her allies to invade Attica, and put down the popular party under Thrasybulus, it was noticed that the only states1 which did not obey the summons were Thebes and Corinth.
Nor did these two states ever again act in unison with that great group of Hellenic peoples which recognized Sparta as their chief and leader.
Some two years later the Lacedaemonians went to war with Elis, and summoned the Confederacy to assist them.
Again there were two exceptions to the unanimity with which the allies, including the Athenians, obeyed the call;
and again those two exceptions2 were Thebes and Corinth.
It was, seemingly, in the year B. c. 396 that Agesilaus was planning his great expedition to Asia Minor.
His mind was full of mighty projects and lofty hopes:
even dreaming of those gigantic successes the achievement of which was reserved for a later period, and for a Macedonian king.
He was a second Agamemnon, conducting the hosts of all Greece to conquer a mightier Troy :
a Pan-Hellenic leader, retorting upon Persia the invasion of Hellas by Xerxes.
He named a rendezvous to which all the troops were to repair, and sent messengers to all the Hellenic cities, both within and without Peloponnesus, fixing the particular quota which each was expected to send 3.
The Boeotians appear to have returned a blunt refusal The Corinthians alleged (and Pausanias actually gives credit to their allegations) that they were most desirous of coming, but were deterred by an evil omen, the recent destruction of their Temple of Olympian Zeus.
Anyhow neither.
Thebans nor Corinthians came.
On this occasion, too, the Athenians excused themselves, on the plea that they had not yet sufficiently recovered from the effects of the Peloponnesian War.
So far the symptoms of alienation were merely of a negative character.
Thebes and Corinth had not moved with the rest of the Confederacy at the summons, and under the leadership of Sparta, but neither had they proceeded to any overt acts of hostility.
But before Agesilaus had started for Asia, the Boeotians had offered to him, and through him to Sparta, a direct and deliberate insult.
The King of Sparta, in emulation of his great predecessor the King of Mycenae, was desirous of inaugurating his expedition by a preliminary sacrifice at Aulis, in honour of the Goddess Artemis 1.
He left the fleet assembled at the southern promontory of Euboea, and came with a single trireme to Aulis to perform the sacrifice.
The victims were slain, their thigh­ bones and fat were on the altar, the fire was kindled, when suddenly a squadron of Boeotian cavalry, hastily dispatched by the Boeotarchs, appeared upon the scene and put a forcible stop to the proceedings;
even driving Agesilaus himself from the temple, and casting from the altar and throwing about in all directions the half-consumed sacrificial meats.
It was said that the rites were not being performed in the proper and customary manner;
but we are not here concerned with the right or wrong of the affair.
In any case the conduct of the Boeotians was a grievous affront, and a deliberate provocation, to the Commander-in-Chief of the foremost Hellenic state.
The sacrifice which was to redound to the glory of Agesilaus was turned into a bitter humiliation;
and he re-embarked on his trireme in great anger, calling the Gods to witness the insulting conduct of the Boeotians.
The incident was not forgotten;
and when at the commencement of the year B. C. 395 the Phocians, assailed by the Boeotians, applied for help to Sparta, the latter1 at once seized the opportunity of declaring war against Thebes, and summoned the Peloponnesian Confederacy to invade Boeotia.
Only one member of the Confederacy refused to comply, and of course that member was Corinth 2.
The army from Peloponnesus, led by Pausanias the King, was to invade Boeotia from the south:
whilst another army, under Lysander, the greatest general and most influential personage in Hellas, was to enter it on the north-west from Phocis.
The two armies were to meet at Haliartus.
Alarmed at these formidable preparations the Boeotians sent an embassy to Athens, to propose an alliance, and the formation of an Anti-Spartan League.
The speech of their envoy, as preserved, or invented, for us by Xenophon, points out in strong and exaggerated language the benefits which might accrue to Athens herself from the proposed alliance.
"Ye will become," says the orator, "far greater than ye ever were;
ye will be leaders of all:
of ourselves, of the Peloponnesians, of your former subjects, yea of the great king himself.
"The question for the Athenian Assembly to decide was one of vital and absorbing interest.
Should they, or should they not, concur with Thebes in establishing an Anti-Spartan League, to which Corinth at all events was quite certain at once to accede?
If they did, they would, for the first time since their fall, be moving out of the shadow of the Spartan supremacy, and would become once more a free and independent Republic.
But they would be uniting themselves to their deadliest enemies, against the very Power which, nine years before, had shielded them from the relentless vengeance of those very enemies.
They would be performing an act of great political ingratitude, and at the same time of great political hazard.
If Thebes and Corinth were again to attack them, they had forfeited all claim to be again protected by Sparta;
whilst if Thebes and Corinth were to make peace with Sparta, they would be wholly unable, in the present state of their fortifications, to make any show of resistance to the Peloponnesian armies.
It must have been a time for great searchings of heart amongst the wisest Athenians;
and Thrasybulus, then the most eminent leader of the people, seems to have been seriously perplexed and uncertain which course it would be more prudent to adopt.
For this was doubtless the occasion on which he first promised the Lacedaemonians to speak in their favour, and then, changing his mind, excused himself on the ground of sudden1 indisposition.
He does not seem however to have taken an active part against them.
I do not know on what authority he is represented by Bishop Thirlwall and Mr. Grote as moving the resolution to accept the Theban proposal, or by Mr. Mitford as " countenancing the measure."
He seems to have done nothing beyond communicating the resolution, when passed, to the Theban envoys, and that too in somewhat ungracious terms, showing that he was fully alive to the perilous character of the step.
However very many, πάμπολλοι, spoke in favour of the alliance, and it was ultimately accepted by the Assembly without a dissentient vote.
The Athenian troops at once started for Haliartus, and though the engagement in which Lysander was defeated and slain took place before their arrival, yet their subsequent presence had a determining influence upon the campaign, and compelled the ignominious evacuation of Boeotia, without a battle, by the army of Pausanias.
This great and striking event, the "march to Haliartus" as it was commonly called, made a deep and lasting impression upon the Athenian mind. "
For ye, 0 men of Athens," says Demosthenes, some sixty-five years afterwards, " when the Lacedaemonians were masters of sea and land, and controlled all countries round about Attica with their har­ mosts and their garrisons—Euboea, Tanagra, the whole of Boeotia, Megara, Aegina, Cleonae, the other islands-whilst ye, for your part, had no ships, and your city no walls, ye marched out to Haliartus, and not many days afterwards to Corinth:
though the Athenians of that time had much ill to remember against the Corinthians and the Thebans for their conduct in the Deceleian war;
but they remembered it not.
Far from it 1."
And the name of Haliartus became so familiarly associated with the glories of Athens that more than two centuries later when the Romans, in their war against Perseus, conquered and destroyed the town, the Athenians preferred a request that the site might be given to them­ selves.
One would infer from Polybius, who speaks of their request with some indignation, that the petition was refused;
but Strabo tells us that the Romans did in fact give them the site, and that in his time it was still in their possession.
Here then we find an alliance which precisely answers to the descrip­ tion given in the speech of Praxagora.
That this was the one chance for Athens, that its refusal would ruin the city, is just what some, at least, of the "many orators " who advocated the alliance might reason­ ably be expected to urge.
But Praxagora goes on to say that, when the Athenians had got the Alliance, they became disgusted with it.
Can this be truly said of the Anti-Spartan League within two years of its inception, that is to say in the spring of B. c. 393 ?
About this there is no doubt whatever.
At first, indeed, everything seemed to promise well.
The League was joined at once by the Corinthians and the Argives, and shortly afterwards by the Euboeans, the Acarnanians, the Leucadians, and other states1.
The Spartan garrisons and alliances beyond Boeotia were swept away, and the Phocians completely defeated.
And when in the following spring and summer (B. C. 394) a large 2 army, composed of contingents from all the members of the League, was gathered together at Corinth, the confidence of the leaders was unbounded.
Timolaus of Corinth proposed an immediate march on Sparta:
for rivers, said he, are smallest at their source, before they become swoln by the influx of their tributaries, and wasps are most easily destroyed in their nests.
Doubtless too there was another reason, the hope of concluding the war off-hand before Agesilaus could return from Asia Minor.
The proposal of Timolaus was adopted, and the army, leaving its great camp near Corinth, marched southward as far as the famous valley of Nemea.
But they had under­ rated the military spirit and the military resources of their opponent.
Instead of attacking Sparta at home, they were forced to retrace their steps to repel an attack by Sparta on their own headquarters.
A Pelo­ ponnesian army, nearly as large as their own, had marched through Sicyon, and was ravaging with sword and fire (τέμνοντες καὶ κάοντες τὴν χώραν) the territory of Corinth.
The battle between these two mighty Hellenic armies, ἡ μεγάλη μάχη πρὸς Αακεδαιμονίους, ἡ ἐν Κορίνθῳ, as 3 Demosthenes describes it, resulted in the total rout of the army of the League, and the main body of the 1Athenian troops, assailed at once in front and on their left flank by the Lacedaemonians, suffered more severely than any other contingent.
The defeated army fled for safety to the walls of Corinth, but the Lacedaemonians were following hard after them;
the gates were shut in their faces, and the fugitives were compelled to take refuge in the neighbouring2 camp from which they had issued, only a few days earlier, in the confident expectation of a victorious march upon Sparta.
The battle of Corinth was fought in the summer of B. c. 394;
and its result made it evident that, even in the absence of the army of Agesilaus, Sparta was more than a match for the Anti-Spartan League.
And before that summer had passed away, Agesilaus returning from Asia, and having traversed Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, entered Boeotia from the north, and inflicted another defeat on the army of the League in the battle of Coronea.
Here again1 an Athenian contingent formed part of the defeated army;
but we have no mention made of its losses, and probably they were slight compared with those sustained in the battle of Corinth.
Thus within a few weeks 2 the entire aspect of affairs had, as regarded Athens, undergone a serious change for the worse.
She had lost many citizens without any beneficial results;
the whole force of the League had been defeated both in the north and in the south;
the bright hopes with which the year B. c. 394 had commenced, had altogether died away;
divided counsels were already making themselves felt at Corinth, and it was but natural that the Athenians should become disgusted, ἤχθοντο, at the failure of all those brilliant expectations, through which they had been induced, less than two years before, to take so active a part in the formation of the Anti-Spartan League.
It was at this juncture, at the commencement of the year B. c. 393, that Praxagora comes forward, in the play before us, to condemn the vacillating policy of the men, and to propose that the government of Athens shall be henceforth entrusted to the women, as the more stable and conservative sex.
But before we discuss her proposals, there are two other points to be mentioned.
We have already seen that, according to the Scholiast, the orator who persuaded the Athenians to contract the alliance with Thebes, and was, in consequence, obliged to leave the country, was none other than Conon ;
Κόνωνα λέγει, is his comment on line 196.
This, of course, is a mere delusion.
Conon had never set foot in Athens since the disaster at Aegospotami;
Aristophanes would not have described that gallant officer simply as one τῶν ῥητόρων;
nor did he ever fall into discredit with the Athenian people.
Why then, it may be asked, was his name so intimately connected, in the mind of the Scholiast, with the Anti-Spartan League ?
It was because, whatever benefit accrued to Athens from the League, she derived through the intervention of Conon.
Already, before the com­ mencement of B. c. 393, whilst the horizon was so dark and threatening at home, it was known that he had won a great victory over the Lacedae­ monian fleet at Cnidus, a victory which was speedily followed by the downfall of the Lacedaemonian power in the islands and beyond the sea.
This victory, however, was not won for Athens;
it was achieved by the Persian fleet, consisting of Greek and Phoenician triremes, under the joint command of Conon and Pharnabazus ;
and the isles of Greece and cities of Asia Minor delivered from the Spartan harmosts and garrisons were not handed over to Athens, but were left as free and independent states.
But before another year had rolled away, before the spring of B. c. 392 had arrived, a brilliant and marvellous change, on--­ might almost say a resurrection, had taken place in the affairs of Athens.
Conon had returned, bringing the Persian fleet, and an ample supply of Persian gold to secure her safety;
the other members of the League had readily assisted, Thebes alone sending 500 skilled workmen;
the Long Walls had risen again, the fortifications of Peiraeus were restored, and Athens was entirely delivered from the doubts and the dangers which had so long beset her.
At the commencement of B. c. 393 Athens was in a state of disquiet and perplexity, still halting between two courses.
There was no doubt or wavering at the commencement of B. c. 392.
Her safety was assured.
She had been finally launched on a new career of prosperity.
The foregoing considerations might of themselves be sufficient to show that Petit and Mr. Fynes Clinton, in giving B. c. 392 as the date of the Ecelesiazusae, have fixed it a year too late.
The deservedly high reputa­ tion of Mr. Fynes Clinton in chronological questions has obtained universal acceptance for that date, although the speech of Praxagora, from begin­ ning to end, cries out against it, and demands the previous year.
And clear as the internal evidence is in favour of B. C. 393, the external evidence is almost equally clear.
The subjoined table of the years of the 96th Olympiad may assist us in an examination of the grounds on which those two distinguished chronologers have come to a wrong conclusion :
The question is whether the Ecclesiazusae was exhibited in the archonship of Eubulides, or in that of Demostratus.
And this to a great extent depends upon another question, viz.
whether τὸ συμμαχικὸν, which is said to have been concluded two years before its exhibition, was concluded in the archonship of Phormio, or in that of Diophantus.
Now Petit (to consider his theory first) fixes on the wrong συμμαχία.
He treats the συμμαχία, to which Praxagora refers, as being not the original Anti-Spartan League, but the subsequent accession to the League of Corinth and Argolis.
And true it is that Diodorus, who has spoken of the original Anti-Spartan League and the march to Haliartus in the 81st chapter of his XIVth Book, does, when he returns to the subject in the following chapter, speak of an alliance being made, during the archonship of Diophantus, between the Athenians, Boeotians, Corinthians, and Argives.
But it is impossible that these accessions to the League can have been the alliance of which Praxagora speaks.
They were contem­ plated from the first;
to them no opposition was possible;
no orator was required to push them through;
no one could have argued that the rejection of these new members would ruin the state, for the idea of rejecting them could not have occurred to anybody;
nor were the Athenians afterwards vexed (ἤχθονοτο) at having admitted them.
In no one point does Petit's συμμαχία answer to Praxagora's συμμαχικόν.
This mistake as to the alliance is the sole foundation for Petit's date of the play, and the foundation being removed the superstructure falls.
Mr. Fynes Clinton of course avoids the error into which Petit, and after him Paulmier, fell.
He recognizes that by the alliance Praxagora must mean the original Anti-Spartan League and the march to Haliartus, but he places these events a year too late, viz. in the archonship of Diophantus.
His sole authority is an observation of Plutarch 1 that an oracle was thought to refer to the two battles of Delium and Haliartus, the latter ὔστερον ἔτει τριακοστῷ γενομένην than the former.
But Plutarch's authority on a matter of chronology is of very slight value;
and Mr. Fynes Clinton seems to have overlooked the express statement of Diodorus2 that the formation of the Anti-Spartan League and the march to Haliartus took place during the archonship of Phormio.
Diodorus arranges his facts in the form of annals, prefixing (in this part of his history) to the events of each successive year the names of the Athenian archon and the Roman consuls for that particular year.
And his positive statement as to the date of an event very greatly outweighs an incidental remark of Plutarch.
And here it is in entire accord with the conviction which must be borne in upon the mind of every thoughtful reader, from a careful perusal of the arguments and allegations of Praxagora.
It seems therefore on every ground absolutely certain, that the play was exhibited in February or March, B. C. 393, after the reverses sustained by the Anti-Spartan League, and before the arrival of Conon, and the rebuilding of the Long Walls of Athens.
Reverting now to Praxagora and her scheme for the future govern­ ment of Athens, we find that the main argument put forward in support of her proposed γυναικοκρατία is based on the more conservative character of the female sex.
lien, she says, are always in quest of novelty and cliange.
Women abide by their principles, and the women of the present day use the same customs and follow the same practices that their predecessors have used and followed throughout all generations.
Athens, imperilled by the restlessness of men, will be saved by the steadfast and sober adherence of women to ancient methods and venerable traditions.
Yet no sooner does Praxagora by these arguments and for these purposes obtain the reins of power, than she spontaneously develops a scheme so startling and so novel, as to throw altogether into the shade the wildest extravagances of the men.
It is a scheme of naked socialism, involving the community of goods, the abolition of marriage, and (what is one­ sidedly called) the community of women.
How can we account for this singular phenomenon?
It has no parallel in any other comedy of Aristophanes.
The Chorus indeed will frequently go over to the side which it began by opposing, and some­ times one of the principal characters will yield to argument, or the stress of circumstances:
but there is always enough in the play itself to determine and explain the change.
Here, however, the heroine, who has been earnestly seeking power for one purpose, immediately employs it for the opposite purpose:
her special mission being to put a stop to all political novelties, she at once introduces a political novelty so vast and revolutionary, that she doubts if the men can be brought to accept it.
And there is not a syllable in the play to justify or account for her sudden change.
It is therefore necessary to look for the determining cause in something outside the play itself.
And it seems impossible to doubt that the cause is to be found in the appearance, whilst Aristophanes was engaged on the Ecclesiazusae, of the Republic of Plato, or at all events of that part of the work which now constitutes Books II to V (inclusive)1 of the Republic.
After the death of Socrates, an event which occurred in June, B.C. 399, Plato, we are told1, retired to Megara, then travelled to some other well- known philosophic centres, Cyrene, Italy, and Egypt, and was con­ templating a visit to the Magians, but finally, διὰ τοὺς τῆς 'Ασίος πολέμους, gave up the idea, and returned to Athens.
If by τοὺς τῆς 'Ασίας πολέμ
ους we are to understand, as seems unquestionable, the expeditions of Dercyllidas and Agesilaus (which would naturally render it unsafe for an Hellenic citizen to journey into the interior of the Persian empire), Plato must have returned to Athens a year or two before the date of the present play.
And this would be in accordance with the tradition that he took part in the battle of Corinth, B. c. 394, though, as we have already seen, the tradition itself rests on no very certain foundation.
But, however this may be, it is clear that his Republic, either in its present, or in an incomplete, shape came into the hands of the Athenian people before the termination of that year.
Praxagora, therefore, having obtained supreme power at Athens, with, apparently, authority to remodel its institutions at her will, suddenly finds, all ready to her hand, as a delightful subject for caricature, the elaborate communistic schemes developed with such detail in this new philosophical treatise.
Aristophanes was not the man to let such an opportunity escape him.
What mattered Praxagora's consistency com­ pared with this brilliant opening for philosophic chaff?
And so the greatest novelty of all, a system of undiluted communism, is at once introduced, by the opponent of all novelty, into the practical everyday life of the people of Athens.
Plato had foreseen that these theories were likely to attract the ridicule of the wits, ra τῶν χαριέντων σκώμ­ ματα, and though he could not have anticipated the form which that ridicule would take, yet the epigram prefixed to this Introduction shows that he Lore the poet no malice for the humorous and impersonal caricature.
It seems strange that any one should ever have doubted or ignored the very obvious fact that in the latter half of the Ecclesiazusae, Aristophanes is laughing at the communistic theories of the Platonic Republic.
Many similarities of thought and diction between the Praxagorean and Platonic schemes will be found pointed out in the Commentary :
and it really is quite inconceivable1 that two writers, one a philosopher and one a comic poet, approaching the subject from such different points of views, should, independently of each other, by a mere fortuitous coincidence, have travelled over so exactly the same ground in (allowing for the grave purpose of the one and the comic purpose of the other) so exactly the same way.
It will be sufficient here to consider a single instance.
In both systems, though for widely different reasons, children will be unable to recognize their parents, and parents their children.
In both cases this fact is only brought out in answer to a question.
In both cases the question is propounded in the same form, not Will they recognize?
but How will they recognize?
(πῶς διαγνώσονται, Plato;
πῶς δυνατὸς ἔστat διαγιγνώσκειν, Aristophanes) the answer being, of course, that no recognition is possible;
all youths must consider themselves the children of all the old people.
Out of this novel state of things a variety of strange and startling results might arise;
but in both cases one, and one only, and that by no means the most obvious, is selected, viz.
the greater security of the old people.
For now, if a youth should assault (τύπτῃ, Plato, Aristo­ phanes) his elder, the bystanders would at once interfere;
since, for all they can tell, they may themselves be the children (Plato adds "or the brothers or the parents ") of the sufferer.
Is the identity of this peculiar train of thought, couched, as it is, in such similar phraseology, merely the result of an accident?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Non ego.
Still a caricature, by its very nature, cannot be a fair representation of the thing caricatured:
and no one would gather from Praxagora's wild proposals any notion of the real tone and spirit of the great philosophers dream.
Let us briefly touch upon some of the more salient points of difference between the two schemes.
And in the first place, the Platonic communism did not extend to the population at large, it was entirely confined to the φύλακες, or guardians of the state.
These were a specially selected class of (say) 1,000 persons, of whom the elder and wiser were to be the governors, and the remainder the military protectors of the New Republic.
And the question which Plato set himself to solve was how he could best ensure that these guardians should faithfully fulfil the high duties assigned them, and not themselves become a danger to the citizens they were intended to protect.
Plato knew no better way, and probably there was no better way, of achieving this end, than to detach them as far as possible not only from all human frailty and all human passion, but even from all human sympathies and associations however innocent in themselves.
Every detail of their training and education is elaborated by Plato with extraordinary care.
From their earliest infancy they were to be surrounded by no influences other than those of beauty and goodness, and to be anxiously preserved " from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul."
And when they were grown up, and enrolled among the actual guardians, they were to stand in the position of the Christian knights of former times, who had taken upon them­ selves the vow of poverty.
They were to renounce all private property, and the ties of a separate family and home:
they were to live in common, and have all things in common.
And thus, it was hoped, they would be free from all private interests and predilections, and be qualified to carry out with a single mind the duties which they were selected to perform.
This then is the first great distinction between the system of Praxa­ gora and the system of Plato.
The former applied to all the citizens for their own enjoyment;
the latter only to a special class for the purpose of enabling them to fulfil more efficiently their special duties towards the state.
And secondly even as regards this special class of guardians, there was nothing, until its members had passed their prime (which Plato limits to the age of fifty-five for a man, and of forty for a woman), in any way resembling that promiscuous intercourse between the sexes which formed so prominent a feature in the system of Praxagora.
On the contrary, until that limit of age was reached 1, no intercourse whatever was permitted excepting under the sanction of marriage, a marriage solemnized amid sacrifices and choral hymns, and invested with all possible sanctity.
It is true that the marriage was merely a temporary one;
the pairs were brought together for marriage by a professed sortition, secretly overruled, if necessary, by the judgement of the ἄρχοντες, and on the next solemn marriage-sortition, the husband and wife would in all probability find themselves assorted with, and married to, different partners.
But however unsatisfactory2 were the marriage laws of the Platonic Republic, however strangely they ignored the family, the true unit on which society is based, they were designed not to gratify, but to eradicate, all evil concupiscence and lust;
to suppress all private desires and inclinations;
to subordinate the feelings of the individual to the interests of the state.
They were as far removed, as the east is from the west, from the universal licence accorded by the system of Praxagora.
The guardians were to act, in all things, not as they themselves desired, but as the state prescribed.
It If somebody were to object," asks Adeimantus, when Socrates has unfolded his views on this topic, It that you are not giving your guardians a very happy life, what would you say to that?"
"I should say," replies Socrates, It that it would not surprise me, if they were to be the happiest people in the world:
but that however this may be, it is with a view not to the pre-eminent happiness of one particular class, but to the common happiness of the entire state, that we are building up our Republic.
"And, thirdly, it must never be forgotten that the Republic of Plato was avowedly an unattainable 1 ideal:
a heavenly vision, to be cherished indeed in the soul as a counsel of perfection, but quite impracticable in the grosser atmosphere of the earth and amidst the sordid passions of mankind.
"You are speaking," says Glaucon to Socrates, at the close of the Ninth Book, "you are speaking of that Republic which we have just been creating, a Republic which exists indeed in theory, but which has no local habitation, I imagine, in any region of this earth." " But in heaven perchance," rejoins the Master, "a pattern is laid up for him that will see, and seeing will enrol himself a citizen therein.
But whether it now exists, or shall hereafter exist, is a matter with which we need not concern ourselves;
for be it real or be it not, by its maxims and by none other will a wise man order his goings."
ITo that I readily assent," says Glaucon.
Even in the philosophic pages of the Republic these topics cannot be discussed without the introduction of much that is distasteful to a delicate mind, and this drawback is greatly increased when the subject is transferred to the comic stage.
The old Attic Comedy was the direct outcome of the phallic1 songs, which were sung, as part of a religious ceremony, at the festivals of Dionysus;
and an Athenian audience would never permit it to forget its origin, or to use other than the broadest and most plain-spoken language with regard to the relations of the sexes, and other matters on which we are happily now more reticent.
Twice 2 at least, in the Clouds and in the Birds, Aristophanes endeavoured to lift the comic art into an altogether different atmosphere;
but in each case, although to modern taste these are amongst the most brilliant and successful of his efforts, the play was refused the prize.
The Athenians could not have objected to the Ecclesiazusae on that score ;
and it seemed at first that there must be so many and such considerable gaps
In the translation, including the omission of an entire scene, that it would have, like the translations of the Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae, to folloto the Greek text, instead of appearing on the opposite page.
Consequently various liberties were taken in the translation;
some lines were omitted, and others inserted;
it was not thought necessary to preserve with such accuracy as in other cases the exact meaning of the original;
and, above all, the long Aristophanic lines, the special favourites of the poet, were unworthily represented by mere anapaestic dimeters.
However the only other1 translation in English verse of which I am aware gives the play in its entirety;
and ultimately, after much hesitation, it seemed possible to follow that example without giving any just cause of offence.
And, indeed, the coarsest passages of Aristophanes are mere comic buffoonery, enacted in the open air, not by actors and actresses before a mixed audience of men and women, but by men only before the male population of Athens, no woman being present.
They are broad and plain-spoken, but never morbid and seductive, and could not be injurious to anybody, who did not come to their study with a mind already corrupted and debased.
As regards the observation just made that, at all events in the time of Aristophanes, no women were present at the performance of a comedy;
it may be permissible to conclude this Introduction with a more minute examination of that question than it has hitherto received.
And this seems the more desirable because a very able scholar, Mr. A. E. Haigh, in his most instructive and agreeable work " On the Attic Theatre," has recently expressed a contrary opinion.
That the solution of the question is to be found, if anywhere, in the hints afforded by the comedies of Aristophanes appears to be universally acknowledged.
It is certain that the indecorum of the comic stage would not have deterred Athenian women from attending its representations.
An Athenian maid or matron, walking through the streets of her own city, could not choose but witness on every side, and indeed at every door, signs and symbols of (to Christian minds) " unspeakable pollution."
The pure and honourable maiden, who obtained the coveted distinction of bearing the Holy Basket in the procession at the Dionysia, walked through the admiring crowds accompanied by symbols and songs of, what we should consider, the most appalling immodesty.
Yet to them­ selves the question of decency or indecency would not even occur.
It was their traditional religion;
it was " the very orthodoxy of the myriads who had lived and died" in the city.
And we know that ladies of all sorts and conditions attended the Roman Mimes 2, which had more than all the grossness, without the counterbalancing radiancy and patriotic elevation, of Athenian comedy.
In discussing therefore the question before us the character of the entertainment is not a factor that requires to be taken into consideration.
Nor must we be influenced in the opposite direction by the circumstance that in later times dramatic performances were regularly attended by men and women together;
for the old Attic comedy was part of a religious festival, and in religious observances nothing was more common than the separation of the sexes.
We must, therefore, approach the question without any a priori prejudice on the one side or on the other, and merely consider what Aristophanes tells us with regard to the composition of his audience.
And twice, at least, he appears to enumerate the various classes of which the audience was composed.
In Peace 50-53 an actor is desirous of putting the audience in posses­ sion of the state of affairs at the commencement of the action;
and he says, I will tell it to the loys, and to the mall men, and to the men, and to the most exalted men, and to the most overweeningly exalted men.
He mentions males of every sort and condition, but he makes no allusion to women.
See also lines 765, 766 of the same play.
Just so in the play before us, 1141, 1144-1146, Praxagora's waiting- maid invites to the banquet all such of the audience as are well disposed to the play, τῶνθεατῶνV εἴ τις εὔνους τυγχάνει.
Her master will not hear of any exceptions, and says, Why not invite them all and omit nobody, καὶ μὴπαραλείψεις μηδένα ?
Why not freely ask old man, youth, and boy ?
All the audience are to be invited, but again there is no mention of women.
There are two other passages in the Ecclesiazusae which have some bearing on the subject.
In lines 435-441, Chremes is telling Blepyrus that in the assembly a speaker (who was in reality Praxagora the wife of Blepyrus) had been saying everything in dispraise of men, and every­ thing in praise of women.
"She called you," says he, " a rascal, a thief, a common informer !" " What, me only ?" asks Blepyrus. "
You and the crowd there," τωνδὶ
To πλῆθος, explains Chremes. "' But the woman,' said the speaker, ' was a wit-fraught thing,' &c."
That by τωνδὶ τὸ πλῆθος we are to understand the audience, is universally admitted, and is, indeed, obvious.
Yet they are all treated as men, and all contrasted with women.
In the rehearsal at the beginning of the play, one of the speakers, addressing the audience in the theatre as if they were the assembly in the Agora, commences her speech by saying, It seems to me, 0 women sitting there.
Praxagora at once interrupts her, What in the world makes you call them women, when they are men ?
Oh, says the other, it was all along of Epigonus there (pointing to an effeminate citizen);
glancing his way, I really thought that I was speaking to women.
Eccl. 165-168.
There would have been no point in this sally if she was actually speaking to women as well as to men.
Epigonus was doubtless the most womanlike object in the theatre then, as Cleisthenes had been thirty years before, at the time of the representation of the Clouds.
There the Clouds are described as changing their form and figure in accordance with the objects they behold.
Many instances are given.
Yesterday they saw Cleonymus, τὸν ῥίψασπιν, and assumed the appearance of timid deer ;
to-day, they behold Cleisthenes amongst the audience, and change themselves into women.
Clouds 348-355.
The Clouds would behold in the theatre nothing more womanly than Cleisthenes.
That the audience are always described in the masculine gender, οί θεαταὶ, οὶ θεώμενοι, οἱ καθήμενοι, is of course quite unimportant.
But when Dicaeopolis commences his elaborate speech in the Achamians with the words ἄνδρες ot θεώμενοι (497), and Euelpides commences his explanation in the Birds with the words ὥνδες οἱ παρόντεςἐν λόγῳ(30), is it con­ ceivable that they are either including women under the description of ἄνδρες, or else addressing a section only of the audience ?
There is hardly a play wherein we do not find numerous passages which seem to take for granted that all the spectators are men, such as, for example, Knights 228 τῶν θεατῶν ὅστις ὶστὶδεξιὸς, the catechism in Clouds 1096-1104, the various appeals to the audience to take political proceedings, which men alone can take, of which the Parabasis of the Achamians and the Epirrhema and Antepirrhema of the Frogs are sufficient instances.
Conversely, we find passages relating to women which seem to take for granted that they are not present in the theatre.
Thus in the Antepirrhema to the first Parabasis of the Birds, the Birds are setting forth the many advantages of wings.
And they say, amongst other things, "
If a man is in love with a councillor's wife, and see the councillor in the theatre, he can fly off at once and pay court to the wife."
They do not say, " If the councillor is in the theatre, and his wife is not;
" the latter circumstance they take for granted.
But perhaps the clearest and most convincing evidence is afforded by the Parabasis of the Thesmophoriazusae.
The Chorus in that play represent Athenian matrons, and in the Parabasis they are turning to the audience, and pleading the cause of the women as against the men.
And throughout their address they contrast the women sometimes with men in general and sometimes with the audience, quite indifferently, as though the two classes-the audience and the men—were for this purpose identical.
"All men," they aver, "say that we are a plague" (and, indeed, this is a commonplace of Hellenic poetry). " Well, then, if we are a plague, why do YE," they say to the audience, " marry us, τί γαμεῖθ' ἡμᾶς ;
Why do ye forbid us to walk abroad, κὰπαγορεύετε μήτ'ἐξελθεῖν, &c.?
Why are ye so anxious to preserve a plague, TO κακὸν βούλεσθε φυλάττειν ;
"
And after several similar observations, they propose a test. "
We say that we are much better than you, ύμῶν ἐσμὲνπολὺ βελτίους, and this we will show by taking the name of an individual man and the name of an individual woman, and comparing them with each other."
They accordingly make several witty comparisons, and conclude by saying οὔτωςἡμεῖς πολὺβελτίους τῶνἀνδρῶν εὐχόμεθ' εἶναι.
It was ὑμῶν πολὺ βετίουςat the beginning, it is τῶν ἀνδρῶν πολὺ βελτίους at the end.
But, indeed, almost every line of the Parabasis postulates that the audience are all of the male sex.
In every comedy of Aristophanes (with the exception of the Plutus) there are constant appeals to the audience;
and frequently, as in Wasps 74-84, particular individuals are singled out for personal satire.
Yet nowhere is there the slightest indication of the presence of a woman amongst the spectators.
Contrast with this the case of Shakespeare.
How rarely does he address the audience !
How plain he makes it that women, as well as men, were spectators of his plays!
The passages cited might easily be doubled :
and against them there is not a syllable1 to be set from the first line of the Acharnians to the last line of the Plutus.
And there seems, therefore, no doubt that no women were present at the performance of any of these comedies.
Whether they were present at the representations of the later phases of Athenian comedy, is quite another matter, and on this point I express no opinion.
But the two passages most commonly cited to prove their presence seem to be altogether beside the mark.
Pollux (ix. 5. segm. 44), to illustrate the word κερκὶς, which, like the Latin cunem, meant one of the wedge-shaped sections into which the auditorium was cut by gangways ascending from the bottom to the top, quotes a couplet from the Γυναικοκρατία of Alexis, a poet of the Middle Comedy, Undoubtedly this looks as though the women were taking their seats in the theatre, seemingly as envoys from some foreign state.
But this is in a γυναικοκρατία, where everything is topsy-turvey, where the men and women have changed places, and the women undertake the duties, and enjoy the privileges, which under other forms of government would be undertaken and enjoyed by the men.
In line 460 of the Ecclesiazusae it is announced that the wife, and not the husband, will henceforth attend the dicastery;
and had the subject been pursued, it would doubtless have been elicited that the wife, and not the husband, was thenceforth to attend the theatre.
No inference can be drawn from this passage as to the attendance of women at the Athenian theatre.
The other passage comes from the Epistles of Alciphron, a writer of great wit and ingenuity, in many respects closely resembling Lucian.
He composed various fictitious letters, generally between fictitious people, but sometimes he selected historical personages to be his assumed cor­ respondents.
And one of his letters is feigned to be written by Menander to his mistress Glycera, on his receiving a summons to attend the Court of King Ptolemy in Egypt.
And Alciphron makes the great comedian say that no diadem which Ptolemy can give him is to be compared with the ivy-wreaths with which he has so often been crowned at the Dionysia' "whilst Glycera.
was looking on, and sitting in the theatre," δρώσηςκαὶ καθημένης ἐν τῷ θεάτρὧῳ Γλυκέρας.
Now if this passage stood alone, we might consider it "conclusive proof," not indeed, as Mr. Haigh says, " that women were present at the New Comedy," but that Alciphron who flourished, probably, 500 or 600 years afterwards, was of that opinion.
But the passage does not stand alone.
Alciphron also composed an answer from Glycera to Menander's supposed letter.
And he makes her say, "
What is Menander without his Glycera, who gets ready his masks, and arrays him in his actors robes, and stands in the παρασκήνια " (the wings from which the actors entered the stage) " nervously pinching her fingers, until the theatre breaks out into ringing applause, and then trembling all over, by Artemis, she revives, and clasps him in her embrace ? "
Is it not plain that Alciphron pictured Glycera not amongst the audience, but in the wings of the theatre;
not only not amongst the audience, but not even in their sight ?
These passages, therefore, seem to have no bearing on the question, whether women did or did not sit as spectators in the Athenian theatre, during the representation of what are known as the Middle and the New Comedies.
EASTWOOD, STRAWBERRY HILL, October, 1901.
H is the only MS.
which gives the Dramatis personae.
Its list is as follows:
-THE stage represents an Athenian street, with three houses in the back­ ground, the houses of Blepyrus, Chremes, and the husband of the Second Woman.
The hour is 3 a m.
and the stars are still visible in the sky.
A young and delicate woman, clad in masculine attire, is standing in the street, hanging up a lighted lamp in some conspicuous place.
The woman is Praxagora, the wife of Blepyrus, who has just left her husband asleep within, and has come out wearing his garments, with his sturdy walking-stick in her hand, and his red Laconian shoes upon her feet.
And the lamp is to serve as a signal to other Athenian women who have agreed to meet her here before the break of day.
No one is yet in sight:
and while she is expecting their arrival, she apostrophizes the lamp in mock­ heroic style, using such language as in tragedy might be addressed to the sun or moon or to some divine or heroic personage.
According to the Scholiast the poet, in this opening speech, is glancing at some passage in the tragedies either of Agathon or of Dicaeogenes.
refers to the addresses to the sun con­ tained in the Ajax of Sophocles (845) and in the opening lines of the Phoenissae of Euripides.
The Scholiast is however quite mis­ taken ;
for earthen vessels of this character were regularly fashioned by the potter's wheel, an instrument well described in Dr. Lardner's Museum of Science and Art (vol. ii. 114-117) from which the remarks which follow are derived.
The upper part of the instru­ ment consists of a vertical shaft rising out of a small circular table, and having at its top a circular horizontal disk.
To this shaft a rotatory motion can bePRAXAGORA.
O glowing visage of the earthen lamp, On this conspicuous eminence well-hung,­imparted from below.
The potter's clay, having been moistened with water until it has acquired the consistency of dough, is placed on this horizontal disk, the shaft is made to revolve, and as the disk spins round, the potter gives the desired shape to the plastic clay, by the gentle pressure of his hands and fingers.
The rude and soft mass of dough acquires under his dexterous fingers the most symmetrical and beauti­ ful forms with marvellous facility and celerity.
The potter's wheel is con­ stantly mentioned, as in the Scriptures.
so in the classical writers of Greece and Rome.
Homer compares the light evolutions of the dance with the quick movement of the wheel in the hands of the potter.
"And now, with feet all cunningly gliding, around whirled they Full lightly, as when some potter sitteth and maketh assay Of the wheel to his hands well fitted, to know if it runncth true."
Iliad xviii. 599 (WAY'S translation).
Such passages as the "Amphora coepit Institui:
currente rota cur urceus exit ?
It of Horace (Ars Poet. 21) and the “Testa alta paretur.... Argillam atque rotam citius properate," of Juvenal (iv. 131) are of course well known.
—Scholiast.
The MSS.
read ἐξητημένον, but the Scholiast probably read ἐζητη­ μένον, and therefore endeavoured to explain εὐσκόποισιν by (1) τοῖς σοφοῖς, (2) τοῖς εὖ σκεπτομένοις, and (3) τοῖς φύ­ λαξιν.
But Paulmier who was the first to change the manuscript reading into ἐξηρτημένον, was also the first to explain the true meaning of εὺσκύποισιν.
" Sig­ num nempe erat," says he, "lucerna accensa.
in loco edito suspensa;
ut ibi convenirent mulieres.
Nam εὔσκοποι τόποι aunt loci eminentes qui undequaque prospiciuntur;
et utitur ea voce Aristo­ teles, H. A. ix. 41;
et ideo postea dicit5 103.
γονάς]
Γοναὶ, as Kuster observes, was a term specially appropriate to the birth of a god or goddess, and such expressions as Διονύσου γοναὶ, Ἀφροδίτης 'ovat, and the like, were frequently adopted by dramatists as the names of their plays.
And as to τύχας Bergler refers to the lines which Euripides places in the mouth of his nurse (Medea 57), lines which, as he observes, Philemon, parodying, places in the mouth of his cook in his Στρατιώτς :
4.
τροχῳ̄]
Here the single word τροχή­ haTo' is expanded into a whole line.
ρύμης is rightly explained by the Scholiast to mean τῆς όρμῆς, the impulse imparted to the wheel by the art of the potter.
5.
μυκτῆρσι]
Properly, the nostrils.
μυκτὴρ, -it ῥινὸς τὸ τρῆμα (vulgo τρίμυμα).
—Hesychius. μυκτῆρες· τὰ έκατέρωθεν τῆς ῥινὸς τρήματα.—Photius.
As applied to a lamp, μυκτὴρ is the round hole on the snout (so to call it) of the lamp, through which the lighted wick pro­ trudes and " performs the shining office of the sun." splendidum solis munus as Seidler, on Eur. EL 993, translates the words Xnμπρὰς ήλίου τιμάς.
A great variety of ancient Greek lamps, both metallic and earthen, may be seen in the British Museum.
Where there is but one μυκτὴρ, the snout extends from the front of the lamp, which is held by(For through thy fates and lineage will we go, Thou, who, by whirling wheel of potter moulded, Dost with thy nozzle do the sun's bright duty)—
Awake the appointed signal of the flame!
Thou only k nowest it, and rightly thou, For thou alone, within our chambers standing, Watchest unblamed the mysteries of love.
Thine eye, inspector of our amorous sports, Beholdeth all, and no one saith Begone!
Thou comest, singeing, purifying all
The dim recesses which none else may see;
And when the garners, stored with corn and wine,a handle at the back.
Where there are two μυκτῆρες, in some specimens the two snouts issue from the front, at an acute angle with each other;
in others, there is a snout at each extremity of the lamp, which is then held by a chain, fastened to a loop at the front and the back of the lamp.
There might indeed be any number of μυκτῆρες.
In one specimen in the British Museum there are no less than seven, arranged in a circle round the lamp, so as to form a sort of chandelier.
The round hole at the top of the lamp is not a μυκτὴρ;
it is the orifice through which the oil is poured into the lamp, and is usually covered by a little lid.7.
σοὶ γὰρ μόνῳ]
The women allow the lamp to be present at their secret assembly, because it has often been the witness of and partner in, their secret doings in their bedchambers, δωματίοισιν, when their husbands are away, and yet has never been known to divulge them.
Musaeus commences his "Hero and Leander" with the invocation εὶπὲ, θεὰ. κρυφίων ἐπιμάρτυρα λύχνον ἐρώτων.
And see Lucian's Cataplus, 27.
The words Ἀφροδίτης τρόποι are equivalent to σχή­ ματα συνουοσίας.
In passages like these the translation is not intended to give the precise sense of the original.

—Photius.
So Hesy­ chius, Suidas, and the Scholiast here.
He means that the store-rooms were long narrow chambers like the colon­ naded buildings which went by the name of aTToni.
The use of the words βαϰχίου νάυατος at the end of the line for “wine” is part of the tragic flavour of the speech.15 20 2516.
ίποιγνίσαισι]
Athenian husbands were accustomed to keep their household stores under lock and key, with their seal, for greater security, affixed to the door.
Athenian wives were accustomed, so soon as their husbands' backs were turned, to tamper with the seal, pick the lock, and pilfer from the store-room corn and wine and oil for their own private purposes.
Such at least is the charge brought against them in the Thesmophoriazusae, which teems with allusions to these petty feminine thefts:
see 418-428, 555, 556, 812, 813.
In the first of these passages the word ὑποῖξαι to open surreptitiously is employed, as here, to describe this secret tampering with the door.
18. Σκίροις]
The parasol festival;
a festival celebrated by the women alone, at midsummer, in the month Sciro­ phorion, in honour of Athene Sciras.
The place of its celebration seems to have been a spot on the Sacred Way just outside the gates of Athens, where was the tomb of Scirus, the Dodonaean seer;
and near it a Temple of Athene Sciras.
It was attended by the priestess of Athene, the priest of the Sun, and the priest of Erechtheus who came down from the Acropolis bearing the sacred white parasol, σκιάδειον λευκὸν a λέγεται Σκῖρον.—Scholiast.
See Thesm.834,835, and the Scholiast there;

ον]
That the Athenian assemblies were ordinarily held at break of day is plain from many authorities.
By stealth we open, thou dost stand beside us.
And though thou knowest all this, thou dost not peach.
Therefore our plans will we confide to thee, What at the Scira we resolved to do.
Ah, but there's no one here who should be here.
Yet doth it draw towards daybreak;
and the Assembly Full soon will meet;
and we frail womankind Must take the seats Phyromachus assigned us (You don't forget?) and not attract attention.
What can the matter be ?
Perchance their beards
Are not stitched on, as our decree commanded, Perchance they found it difficult to steal
Their husband's garments.
Stay I I see a lamp
Moving this way.
I will retire and watch, Lest it should haply be some MAN approaching!
And see Ach. 20;
Thesm. 375;
infra 85, &c.22. Φυρόμαχος] Γράφεται, άς Κλεόμαχος. καί фασί Кλεόμαχον τραγικόν ύποκριτήν.
ούτος фαίνεται ύποκρινόμενός ποτε είρηκέναι έδρ
ος έν δράμτι καί έσκŵфθαι διά τύ κακ­ έμφατον.—Scholiast.
We have already seen (in the first note) that these are the lines which the Scholiasts connect with some tragic play of Agathon or Dicaeo­ genes.
And it seems probable that Phyro­ machus (or Sphyromachus or Cleoma­ chus) was the hero of the play, who bad directed his έταίρους (doubtless the Chorus of the drama) to lie unobserved in am­ bush.
whilst he himself was undertaking some perilous adventure.
And here we have, I suspect, the very words of the Coryphaeus, reminding the Chorus of their leader's direction.
This explains the words εὶ μέμνησθ᾽ ἔτι, which other­ wipe would be strangely out of place in Praxagora's soliloquy.
We may well believe that something in the speaker's intonation or, it may be, his known dis­ solute character, suggested the change of τοὺς έταίρ
ους into τὰς έταίρας.
Possibly Κλεόμαχ
ος was the name of the actor or of the Coryphaeus.
The Scholiast offers a second explanation ό δὲ Σφυρόμαχος ψήφισμα εἰσηγήσατο ὤστε τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τοὺς ἄνὸρας χωρὶς καθίζεσθαι, καὶ τὰς έταίρας χωρὶς τῶν ἐλευθέρων.
But as nobody ever heard of such a decree, or can imagine any festival or meeting to which it can possibly apply, this second explanation may safely be disregarded.
The Scholiast evidently takes it to apply to the regular assemblies of the people, which of course is quite out of the question.

ῶρα βαδίζειν]
Confer infra 285.
μία τῶν ἐρχομένων γυναικῶν, says the Scholiast, πρὸς τὴν Πραξαγάρν ταῦτα λέγει. κῆρυξ ό ἀλέκτωρ.
The woman seems to be talking to herself and not addres­ sing Praxagora, who has withdrawn out of sight before these two lines com­ menced, and does not reappear until they are concluded.
She is entering quite alone, and the expression ἡμᾶν προσιόντων is an illustration of the well- known rule which Dawes laid down in his criticism on line 516 of this play, and which is more pointedly enunciated by Person at Hec. 509, " Si mulier de Be loquens, pluralem adhibet numerum, genus etiam adhibet masculinum;
si masculinum adhibet genus, numerum etiam adhibet pluralem."31. κεκόκκυκεν]
The word is used παρὰ προσδοκίαν.
This second cockcrowing is considered to take place about the close of the third watch of the night;
that is, about 3 a.m., each nightwatch occupying three hours;
viz.(1)6 to 9 p.m., (2) 9 p.m. to 12, (3) 12 to 3 a.m., (4) 3 to 6 a.m.
It is strange that Juvenal (ix. 107) should use the expression the crowing of the second cock" for the second crowing of the cock ";
but our own writers do the same.
Thus in Romeo and Juliet, iv. 4, old Capulet, who has been up all night hastening on the wedding festivities, says
The second cock has crowed, 'tis three o'clock."
In the last scene of Richard III, however, Shakespeare puts it rightly "The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn " :
and some time afterwards when the question is asked How far into the .morning is it, lords?
It the answer is " Upon the stroke of four."33.
τὴν νύκτα πᾶσαν] Praxagora, though a woman, is given to exaggeration.
She has.
apparently, been waiting about five minutes.34. θρυγνῶσα]

Σαλαμίνιος]
It is probable that there was a sort of ferry between Salamis and the mainland of Attica;
and that the Salaminians were inces­ santly rowing, ἐλαύνοντες, boats (which were called κέλητες) across the straits, to carry passengers to and fro.
See Lysistrata 60, Frogs 204.
And cf. Xen. Hell. v. 1. 23.
And as the words ἐλαύ­ νειν and κέλης were both used also in re amatoria, the name “Salaminian” became in vulgar language the equiva­ lent of συνουσιαστικός.
We have now on the stage Praxagora and two other women, who are doubtless represented by the three professional or state actors, that is to say, by the three actors pro­ vided by the state at the public expense.
But lines 54-56 are unquestionably delivered by a fourth speaker, and if she were a fourth woman on the stage, she would have been represented by a choregic actor, that is, an additional actor supplied by the choregus at his own expense.
Choregic actors are by no means uncommon in these comedies, and the attempts made to eliminate them have always been ludicrously un­ successful.
Such cases as those of Lysi­ strata, Calonice, Myrrhina, and Lampito in the Lysistrata;
of Dionysus, Xanth­ ias, and the two hostesses in the Frogs;
of Dionysus, Aeschylus, Euripides, and Pluto in the same comedy;
and many others, cannot be explained away.
Still I do not think that we have a choregic actor here, or that any person appears upon the stage in this scene, except Praxagora and the two women already there.
The women who during the next sixteen lines keep dropping in, either singly or in small groups, are in my opinion all members of the Chorus making their way to the orchestra.
They are probably twelve in all, form­ ing a semichorus, and representing that section of Praxagora's followers which dwelt within the city walls.
The other section, the women from the country, enter in a body, infra 800, singing their entrance song.
Then the two semi­ choruses coalesce and become the full Chorus of the play.
And the speaker of lines 54-56, and a few other lines in the conversation, is in my opinion the coryphaeus, who enters with the first semichorus.
41. Κλειναρέτην]
Now enter, on their way to the orchestra, seven other women, all distinguished by their own names or by the names of their husbands.
As they are passing in, the actors, standing on the stage, make their comments about them, exactly as Peisthetaerus and the Hoopoe, in the Birds, discuss the members of the Chorus, hurrying in to the orchestra there.
These seven women were probably well known to the audience, and doubtless there were reasons for their selection with which we are now unacquainted:
but we may conjecture that Smicythion resembled the " auld man" whom Burns's "young lassie " married, who's doyl't an' who's dozin', whose bluid it is frozen," so that Melistiche found no difficulty in escap­ ing from him unobserved.
And Geusi­ strata was probably often seen by her customers in the attitude here depicted, ἔχουσα τὴν λαμπάδα ἐν τη̃ δεξιᾳ̑.
Torches would be frequently blazing in the καπηλεῖον till late at night.

These are the words of the coryphaeus, hurrying on her companions, just as in the parodos of the Wasps, the coryphaeus urges on his slow-paced Chorus.
There the Chorus was composed of men, and the stimulus is found in the " pot of money " which Laches is supposed to possess.
Here the Chorus is composed of women, and the poet plays on the bibulous propen­ sities which he always attributes to Athenian ladies by telling them that " the hindmost" shall forfeit more than two gallons of wine.45. χαίνικα] 0 monstrous!

Chickpease and wine were as familiarly associated by the Athenians, as walnuts and wine by our­ selves:

Some pas­ sages illustrating this practice are cited in the note to Peace 1131.
Glyce, who does not seem to be one of the arrivals, was probably known as a lady of very convivial habits.48.

The coryphaeus, having marshalled her little troop in the orchestra, now, like the second woman, narrates her night's experiences to Praxagora, who is universally recog­ nized as the leader of the movement.57.

She is addressing her comrades on the stage, who accordingly .are found sitting through the ensuing rehearsal scene, save only when they arise to speak.

τὰς μασχάλας] ῎Εθρεψαν γὰρ τρίχας, ἵνα ὅταν χειροτονῶσι, δοκῶσιν ἄνδρες εἶναι.— Scholiast.
It must be remembered that Athenian women were accustomed to pluck out, or singe or shave off, every hair which was thought to detract from the beauty and delicacy of their persons.
Hence the allusion to τὸ ξυρὸν five lines below.
64. πρὸς τὸν ἥλιον]
The object of all this was to give her a sunburnt and athletic, and therefore a masculine, ap­ pearance.
ὥστε μέλαινα γενέσθαι ὡς ὰνὴρ, as the Scholiast says.
In Lucian's Anacharsis, 25, Solon is explaining to the Scythian visitor the advantages which the Athenian youths derived from performing their athletic exercises oiled and naked in the sun.
And, amongst other things, he says that it makes themSEMICH.

᾽Επικράτους]
This Epicrates was the notorious and venal demagogue who took part with Thrasybulus in the overthrow of the Thirty and the restoration of the Athenian democracy.
In person, the Scholiast tells us, he was distinguished by a beard of such dimensions that be was dubbed by the Attic wits ᾽Επικράτης ὁ Σακεσφόρος (from σάκος, σάκου, cf. infra 502) Epicrates of the mighty beard, in allusion, as Bergler observes, to Αἵας o Σακεφόρος (from arator, σάκεος) Αἵας of the mighty shield.
See Bacchylides, xiii. 71;
Soph. Ajax 19.
The Scholiast cites a line from Plato Comicus ἄναξ ὑπήνης, ᾽Επίκρατες σακεσφόρε, to which Bergler adds from the thirteenth of the Socratic epistles, καὶ τῶν τὰ κοινὰ πρασσόντων ᾽Επικράτεα τὸν Σακεφόρον, and Meineke (Hist. Crit. 183) from Plutarch's life of Pelopidas, chap. 30 ᾽Επικράτους ποτὲ TOp βείας.—Harpocration.
The word Σακεσ­ φόρ
ος gave some trouble to copyists,and in Plutarch it was changed to Σκευοφόρος, and in Harpocration, as in the parallel passage in Suidas, into ῎Εφορος, until Maussacus (on Harpo­ cration) restored the genuine reading.
And as in appearance Epicrates was distinguished by a beard of a size un­ usual amongst his contemporaries, so in character he was distinguished by a career of venality and peculation unusual even amongst Athenian dema­ gogues.
When the Persians, alarmed at the progress of Agesilaus in Asia, sent an envoy to stir up hostility against Sparta at home, he was one of the few Athenians (so few that Xenophon ignored them altogether) who con­ descended to accept the Persian gold.- Pausanias, Laconica, ix.
4. Afterwards he was sent with Phormisius (infra 97) and others on an embassy to the Persian Court, and again accepted enormous bribes to carry out the designs of the great king.
On this charge, coupled with charges of peculation, he and his fellow ambassadors were brought to trial at Athens, and Lysias, who seems at one time to have been his friend (see the commencement of the Phaedrus), wrote against him a hostile speech, of which only the peroration, ἐπίλογος, has reached us.
It was apparently on this occasion that, as Plutarch, ubi supra, informs us, he boldly acknowledged that he had been enriched by Persian gifts, and recommended the Athenians instead of electing eleven archons, to elect every year eleven pauper ambassadors, to be enriched at the Persian Court.
At this sally the Assembly laughed consumedly, and Epicmtes seems to have been lèt off.
Athenaeus, vi. 58, cites the same anecdote from Hegesander.
In connexion with this embassy too the poet Plato wrote a play which he called the Ambassadors, Πρέσβεις, (possibly the play from which the line cited by the Scholiast is taken), in which he saidPRAX.

On some subsequent occasions, if we can trust Demosthenes, Epicrates and his fellow ambassadors were condemned to death on a similar charge of corrup­ tion.

She is addressing the women, other than the two who have just asserted their compliance with her wishes.
As to the Λακωνικὰς, the men's " red Laconian shoes," see the note on Wasps 1158 and infra 345.77.
Λαμίου]
Lamias, the speaker's hus­ band, was, the Scholiast says, the δεσμοφύλαξ, or the keeper of the public prison.
He was therefore bound to be extremely watchful, and his wife is naturally jubilant at having got away, unobserved by his vigilant eyes.
His name affords a handle for the unseemly jest which follows, and which is based on an incident in the old legends about the ogress Lamia, ὑπὲρ ἧς, says the Scholiast, ὁ Κράτης λέγει ἐν τῷ όμωνύῳ δράματι, ο̃τι σκυτάλην ἔχουσα ἐπέρδετο. Cf. Wasps 1177 and the note there.
I take the last four words of line 78 to be a quotation either from the Lamia of Crates or from some other version of the old nursery-tale;
and the preceding expression τοῖτ᾽ ἔστ᾽ ἐκεῖνο not to refer to the σκύταλον in particular, but to be the familiar form of recognition, TOuT' ἐκεῖνο (Birds 354, Frogs 1341 and passim), leading up to the quotation.

The meaning of the lines is somewhat obscure, but not, I think doubtful.
The speaker is magnifying her own dexterity in escaping unob­ served, by enlarging upon the extra­ ordinary vigilance of her husband.

Of the public execu­ tioner," who was doubtless placed underthe supervision of the keeper of the prison.
Argus, since
Io while under his charge bore the form of a cow, was popularly regarded as a cowherd, βουκό­ λος, and Bergler aptly refers to Aesch.
Suppl. 297-300
I think therefore that βουκολεῖν here means simply to tend, and not, as most editors take it, to beguile or deceire:
nor can I acquiesce in Bothe's alteration of τὸν δήμιον into τὸ δήλιον the people ;
for Lamias was a gaoler, not a demagogue, and the notion of beguiling the people is quite foreign to the scope of the passage.
88. ἄστρα]
The early scenes in this play, as in the Wasps, are supposed to take place before daybreak.
Night was probably represented on the Athenian stage by some black or star-spangled sky-scene, which when the day was supposed to break would be wound off round one of the περίακτοι, or scene­ rollers, so unwinding from the other roller the day-scene which was to take its place.87.

The women were to occupy the front rows, just below the βῆμα, and so would be face to face with the presiding prytanes.
In after times, these presi­ dents were found too few in number to keep order, and a whole tribe (τὸ δέκατον μέρος τῆς πόλεως) was told off to sit as presidents beside the βῆμα;

Γυνὴ ἔρχεται, φέρουσα καὶ ξαίνουσα ἔρια.—Scholiast.
Although in the translation I have used the more familiar word If spinning," yet ξαίνουσα of course signifies the preliminary opera­ tion of carding the wool, that is, working it between instruments like brushes, but with wire instead of hair, until all knots and matted tangles are rubbed out, and the wool is formed into long rolls of a similar texture throughout, and so rendered fit for the spindle.
See Lysi­ strata 535, 536, and 579.97. Φορμίσιον]
Καὶ οὗτος δασὺς ἦν.
(He had previously said of Epicrates, οὖτος εἰς δασύτητα κωμῳδεἱται.) αἰνίττεται δὲ τὸ γυναικἱον αἰδοῖον.—Scholiast.
The state­ ment in Hesychius (s. v. ᾽Αριστόδημος) that comic writers called To γυναικεῖα αἰδοῖα, amongst other names, Φορμισί
ους is doubtless grounded on the passage before us.
Much that was said about Epicrates in the note on 71 supra might be repeated about Phormisius here.
Like Epicrates, he was a rough big­ bearded man (μέγαν ἔχων πώγωνα· καθίει τὸν πώγωνα.—Scholiast on Frogs 965,966).
Like Epicrates, he took part in the restoration of the democracy:
and we have already seen that he was joined with Epicrates as well in the embassy to the Persian Court, as in the subse­ quent impeachment for receiving bribes therein.
In the Frogs (965, where see the note) he is selected by Euripides as a sample of the rough hirsute personages which the teaching of Aeschylus was calculated to turn out;
in contrast to Θηραμένης ὁ κομψὸς, whom he claims as the product of his own teaching.
After the fall of the Thirty, Phormisius intro­ duced a measure for restricting the franchise to the owners of land, a pro­ posal against which was written the fragment known as the thirty-fourth oration of Lysias, " Against doing away with the ancient constitution of Athens."
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who preserves the fragment, prefaces it with the follow­ ing statement:
Φορμίσιός τις τῶν κατελ­ εὐρύπρωκτος.—Scholiast.
The expression πρότερον ἦν γυνὴ refers of course to unnatural crimes in which Agyrrhius as a youth was supposed to have par­ ticipated.
According to Andocides, whose bitter enemy he was, Agyrrhius for several years farmed the harbour dues at a price (thirty talents a year) very greatly beneath their actual value, buying off competitors by paying them a sum down, and promising a share in the booty.
Andocides, perceiving his knavery, outbid him by offering thirty­ six talents, and even so made a moderate profit (Andoc. De Mysteriis, 133, 134.
It was probably in connexion with these transactions, that he was accused of embezzlement and thrown into prison (Dem. in Timocr. 153):
but at the present moment all these ill deeds were forgotten, and he had become a prime favourite of the people, by the ordinary demagogic trick of increasing the publicNo, if we sit in front and gather round us Our husbands' garments, none will find us out.
Why, when we've got our flowing beards on there, Who that beholds us will suppose we're women ?
Was not Agyrrhius erst a woman ?
Yet Now that he wears the beard of Pronomus, He passes for a man, a statesman too.
O by yon dawning day, 'tis just for that,doles.
The fall of Athens from her imperial position must have made it more difficult for the poorer clashes to earn their living by attending the dicas­ teries, and Agyrrhius hit on the idea of paying them for their attendance at the Assemblies also.
At first he got the payment (τὸ ἐκκλησιαστικὸν, as it was called) fixed at one obol:
but this proved ineffective (infra 302);
and it was raised by Heracleides to two obols.
Thereupon, a year or two before the date of this play, Agyrrhius carried a further decree fixing it, like the δικαστικὸν, at three obols.
—Aristotle, Polity of Athens, chap. 41 ;
and see infra 183-188 and 801-810.
Hence he became a leading personage in the state (πράττει τὰ μέγιστ᾽ ἐν τῇ πόλει, cf. Birds 800), and on the death of Thrasybulus succeeded him as the στρατηγὸς on the coast of Asia (Xen. Hell. iv. 8. 31).
The comedian Plato represented the Athenian Demus as saying —Plutarch, Praecepta GerendaeReipub­ licae, v. See Plutarch's remarks on this election.
The memory of the man who introduced the τριώβολον ἐκκλησιαστικὸν was long popular in Athens, and De­ mosthenes (ubi supra), whilst recording his peculations, yet describes him as The comic poets, on the other hand, had a special grudge against him from the fact that he reduced the gratuity which they bad been accustomed to receive from the state.
See Frogs 867.
Pronomus was probably an Athenian, and not the illustrious Theban who taught Alcibiades the flute.
This little incident of the women's fictitious beards seems to introduce us to all the re­ markable beards at Athens, those of Epicrates, Phormisius, Agyrrhius, Prono­ mus.
—Scholiast.
Agyrrhius, she means, has become a power in the state, by ceasing to be a woman, and assuming the beard and appearance of a man:
and we will try a similar experiment in the hope ofa similar result.
The words νὴ τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν ήμέραν are certainly a strange adjuration;
but we must remember that they are used by a woman, and we should beware of altering the τοι νὴ of the MSS.

θέομεν]
Θεῖν is to scud with sails before the wind, ἐλαύνειν to propel the boat with oars.
Dobree refers to the narrative which Xenophon gives of the hasty voyage of Iphicrates around the coasts of Peloponnesus:
εἰ μὲν αὔρα Φέροι, θέοντες ἄμα ἀνεπαύοντο· εἰ δὲ ἐλαύνειν δέοι, κατὰ fitρος τοὺς ναύτας ἀνέπαυεν.—Hell. vi. 2. 29.
The Scholiast rightly explains the present passage to mean οὔτε ἀνέμοις οὔτε κώπαις (nec velis nec remis) πλέομεν, and cites the proverb which, as Bergler observes, is found in Aristaenetus, i. 14 ad fin. and elsewhere, ἂν ἀργύριον ᾐ, πάντα θεῖ κ’ ἐλαύνεται, everything goes on swimmingly.110.

orators.—Knights 877-880, Clouds 1093.
It may have been merely a hasty generalization from one or two con­ spicuous instances (see the note on 102 supra):
and yet it is conceivable that the total loss of shame which must accompany such turpitude might make men more reckless, and therefore more ready, speakers.
By a converse argu­ ment to that which Praxagora employs, the sophist whom Lucian holds up to our abhorrence in his Rhetorum Prae­ ceptor (23) contends that as women are λαλίστεροι than men, therefore the most effeminate orators will also be the most effective.

The women in general are not to assume their beards until 273 infra.
Only the intending speakers are to put them on now.
Hence Praxagora, when putting hers on, four lines below.
is careful to explain that she does so in view of speaking herself.
122.
τοὺς στεφάνους]
Praxagora ap­ pears to have been holding several chaplets for the use of the speakers.
These she puts down whilst tying on her beard.
126. σηπίαις] ’Απρόσλογ
ος ή εἰκασία, says the Scholiast.
It probably refers to some fanciful similarity between the complexion of the women,lightly bronzed by the sun, and the colour of the white cuttlefish lightly browned by the fire.
λευκαὶ γὰρ αἱ αηπίαι, says one Scholiast;
ἐσταθεμέναις δὲ, ἐξ ἐπιπολῆς ὀπτηθείσαις· σταθεύειν γὰρ τὸ μὴ λίαν ὀπτῆσαι, adds another.
But this is a frivolous woman;
and Praxagora has no time to waste on such idle fancies as these.
She is the one woman of the party who is thoroughly sensible, and thoroughly in earnest;
and taking no notice of her companion's nonsense, she hurries in pantomime through the preliminary ceremonies, after which the REHEARSAL imme­ diately begins.
128.
ὁ περιστἱαρχος]
The peristiarch was an official who superintended the purification of the place in which an Athenian Assembly was to be held by carrying sacrificed sucking-pigs nround its limit.
All who took part in the Assembly were required to come within this line of purification.
Cf. Acharnians44. Pollux (viii segm.
104) has a short article Περὶ Περιστιάρχων, and observes τοῦτο χοιρίδιον ἐκαλεῖτο, As the perist­ arch purified the theatre as well as the place of assembly, he was probably even now sitting amongst the audience,andwas personallyaddressedby Praxagora.
These lustrations were also called περίστια.—
Photius s.v. περιστίαρχος. See Aeschines against Timarchus, 28, and the Scholiasts there;
Schömann de Comitiis Athenien­ sium, i. 8 (Paley'stranslation).
Praxagora substitutes γαλῆν for χοιρίδιον, not wishing in an assembly of ladies to use so ambiguous a word as the latter.
129.
πάριτ’ ἐς τὀ πρόσθεν]
It would seem, from Acharnians 43, 44, that this was the recognized formula wherewith the κῆρυξ invited the people to come within the line of lustration.
Of An­ phrades the Scholiast says ὡς ἀναμεμιγ­ μένου αύταίς' λοιδορείταί δέ πμναίκας αἰσχρὸς ὢν κιθαρῳδός.
Apparently, there­ fore, the Scholiast would identify the person here addressed with that Ari-Maybe I'll make a little speech myself.2nd W. 0, here, sweet love, Praxagora:
look, child !
O what a merry joke this seems to me!
PRAX.

phrades of whose bestiality we have heaid more than enough in the Knights, the Wasps, and the Peace.
And so also the Scholiast on Lucian's Pseudologista, 3. But that was thirty years ago:
those scandals must have long since passed into oblivion.
There is nothing un­ common in the name of Ariphrades;
and the offence here attributed to Ari­ phrades is merely "talking," an offence perhaps not altogether alien to a woman's character, τίς γὰρ γυναικῶν ov λαλεῖν ἐπίσταται;
And in my judgement Praxagora, in the character of κῆρυξ, is merely calling upon one of the women to stop chattering and to come and take her seat within the line of purification.
She naturally uses a man's name (as if she were in the real Assembly, cf. infra 293, 294), though of course the adjective ἀριφραδὴς is both masculine and feminine.
And παριὼν in the next line is used in precisely the same sense as πάριτε in this.130.
τίς ἀγορεύειν βούλεται;
]
Here we have the well-known formula with which the κῆρυξ, declares the debate to be opened.
See Acharnians 45, Thesm. 379.
In each of these instances, as here, the intending speaker simply answers ’Εγώ.
Originally, men over fifty years of age were first invited to speak:
ἐπερωᾷ ἄλλων τὸν βουλόμενοτ.—Aeschi nes against Timarchus, 23.
But as Schö­ mann (De Comitiis, i. 10) remarks, with something like a feeling of personal resentment, “this custom had long been obsolete;
and young men scarcely out of their teens, with a very diminutive stock of knowledge, but a very consider­ able one of impudence, were generally the first to take possession of the bema, and not unfrequently the last to give it up to their betters.
"131. TOP στέφανον] Στφανοῦιται γὰρ οἱ δημηγοροῦντες.— Scholiast.
That Athen­ ian orators wore a wreath while deliver­ ing their speeches is of course well known ;
and the custom is noticed by Aristophanes not only in the scene before us, but also in the Birds and the Thesmophoriazusae.
Wreaths were also worn by revellers;
οἱ ἐν roif συμποσίοιςίστεφανοῦιτο, says the Scholiast on 133 infra.
See infra 691 and the note there.
The assumption of a wreath, therefore, might mean either that the wearer was about to speak (as Praxagora intended it), or that she was about to commence a revel (as her friend interprets it).
A very similar misapprehension occurs, when Peisthetaerus, about to commence his oration to the Birds, calls out:
Boy, bring me a wreath for my hair And a wash for my hands.
Er. Why, what mean these commands?
Is a dinner in near contemplation.
PEI.
No dinner, I ween :
'tis a SPEECH that I mean, a stalwart and lusty oration.
-Birds 463-5.
By a somewhat analogous inference, from the custom of placing a wreath on the head after death, it is argued in the Tagenistae (Fragm. 1 in Meineke's Fragm. Corn. Graec.) that the dead must be going to a banquet in the unseen world:
Why should they lay our corpses out, arranged With wreaths, and perfumed with the sweetest scents, Unless we're straightway going to drink below ?132. πρὶν πιεῖν]

Solemn prayers were usually accompanied by libations:

ἐπὶ ταῖς σπονδαῖς καὶ ταῖς εὐχαῖς, Wasps 863.
The woman therefore infers from the prayers with which the Assemblies were opened, that there must have been wine present for the purpose of the ac­ companying libations;
and insinuates that the prayers were offered for the sake of obtaining the wine.

The second speaker makes a brilliant start, well suited to an orator addressing the Assembly for the first time.
And she goes on swimmingly until the recognized female oath μὰ τὼ θεὼ (by Demeter and Persephone) in­ advertently escapes her and reveals her sex.

The speaker, unaccustomed to public speaking, commences by saying, I'll not permit;
then, recollecting that it is for the Assembly, and not for herself alone, to decide the matter, she adds apologetic cally, So far at least as my single vote [or opinion] goes.
To connect, as is commonly done, μίαν with οὐκ ἐἀσω and ἐμποιείν, I'll not permit one single woman to make, is contrary both to the sense of the passage and to the Greek idiom.

λάκκους]
Λάκκοι were tanks or rectangular pits dug in the ground, and lined with some water-tight cement, κονία, which rendered them safe recep­ tacles for wine or oil.

Pho­ tius.

Blaydes refers to Xenophon's Anabasis, iv. 2. 22 καὶ γὰρ οἴν
ος πολὺς ἦν, ὄν ἐν λάκκοις κονιτοῖς εἶχ

It seems that in some taverns a pernicious custom had grown up, of filling these tanks with water instead of wine:
and against this the wine-loving woman indignantly protests.155.
μὰ τὼ θεώ]
On this, the favourite oath of Athenian women, see Wasps 1396 and the note there.
These unlucky words no sooner slip from the speaker's lips than Praxagora angrily interrupts her and, it would seem from 163 infra, snatches the chaplet from her head.

After adjusting the chaplet on her own head, Praxagora proceeds to deliver a well-considered speech;

There was a time, my friends, we never cameWar:
Cleon, Hyperbolas, Cleopbon.
In Peace 684 the appellation πονηρὸς προστάτης is expressly applied to Hyper­ bolus :
and it would almost seem from Plutus 920 that the combination of these two words had become, in a manner, proverbial.
Cleopbon appears to have acquired his supremacy by insti­ tuting the dole of the θεωρικὸν, and now, we may well believe, Agyrrhius was attaining a similar position by his institution of the dole of the ἐκκλησι­ αστικόν.
See the note on 102 supra.
For, in my judgement, Praxagora is here contrasting Agyrrhius as a πορνηρὸν προσ­ τάτην (whence the epithet πορνηρὸν, 185 infra) with Thrasybulus:
the former haring only his own aggrandisement at heart;
the latter a genuine patriot, earnestly promoting the real welfare of the people.
Yet Agyrrhius was fast becoming the popular favourite, whilst the influence of Thrasybulus was steadily declining.183.
ἐκκλησίαισιν κ.τ.λ.]
Dicit tempus ante Periclem, says Bothe, absurdly.
Praxagora is contrasting the state of things before, with the state of things after, the introduction by Agyrrhius of the τρώβολον ἐκκλησιαστικόν.
She notices two points of contrast:
(1) Before that period the citizens had become quite unaccustomed to attend the Assembly, whereas now they flock to it.
This is the burden of the second semichorus, infra 300-310;
and cf. Plutus 329. (2) Before that period everybody recognized that Agyrrhius was a rogue:
whereas now it is difficult to praise him enough.
The words οὐκ ἐχρώμεθα simply mean that the habit of attending the Assembly had fallen into general disuse.
186.
ύπερεπῄνεσεν]
Here again Bothe absurdly says, nimium laudare solet con­ ciones, whereas the meaning is lauded Agyrrhius to the skies, extravagantly praised Agyrrhius.
But indeed none * of the commentators seem to have the slightest inkling of what Praxagora is talking about in this portion of her speech, all of them esteeming apparently the minutiae of the poet's language of more account than the working of the poet's mind.
Plat,;
θέλων λαβεῖν.—Scholiast.
Accord­ ing to the Scholiast, therefore, it is a case of sour grapes.
They who cannot get the τριώβολον hide their disappoint­ ment by railing at the immorality of those who are more successful.
I think that this is certainly the meaning of the passage, the course which the οὐ λαβὼν takes being introduced as it were παρὰ προσδοκίαν;
though no doubt there were many honest citizens who refused the pay (ἐκκλησιασταὶ οἰκόσιτοι), and sincerely lamented the prevailing cor­ ruption.
And cf. Isocrates de Pace, 155, 156.190.
'Αφροδίτην ὤμοσας]
Like the oath by the twain goddesses, the oath by Aphrodite was peculiarly a woman's oath.
It is employed six times in the present play, six times in the Lysistrata, and once in the Plutus, and invariably by a woman.

then we knew full well Agyrrhius was a rogue:

Then don't acquire the habit.
This League again, when first we talked it over,these comedies is Thesm.
254, and it is an exception which proves the rule;
for there it is used by Mnesilochus, who is being dressed up in woman's clothes, to pass off as a woman, and who there­ fore naturally employs the oath proper to a woman.
The words μηδ᾽ ἐθίζου. two lines below, mean Don't get into the habit of praising me in that manner.
It is not unusual with the poet, when one of his characters is making an argumentative speech, to punctuate each branch of the argument by some such interruption as the present.
See the note on Wasps 559.
Here Praxagora's argument is divided by interruptions into four sec­ tions.
The object of the first section was to show how men mismanage the internal affairs of the state by giving their confidence to corrupt and profli­ gate self-seekers like Agyrrhius, in preference to true and tried friends of the people like Thrasybulus.
The second section relates to their mis­ management of external affairs by reason of their impatience and incon­ stancy.
The third section consists of a proposal that since the men have proved so incompetent to manage the state, its affairs should now be placed in the hands of the women ;
whilst the fourth and last is a prolonged eulogy of the women, showing their really very remarkable qualifications for guiding and preserving the state.
Scholiast.
Petit's suggestion that Λακε­ δαιμονίων in the scholium ought to be ᾽Αθηναίων has met with universal accept­ ance.
For Praxagora is beyond all doubt referring to the momentous Anti-Spartan League of B. c. 395, which was inaugurated by the battle of Haliartus and the death of Lysander, which at once raised Athens from the position of a mere dependency of Sparta into that of a free and leading Hellenic state;
and which in its result altered the whole current of Hellenic history.
Originally struck between Thebes and Athens it was quickly joined by Argos, Corinth, and other important states,and became so powerful that the military leaders proposed at once to march upon Sparta and “ destroy the wasps in their nest."
But in the following summer the great battle of Corinth, ἡ μεγάλη μάχη πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους, ἡ ἐν Κορίνθῳ (Demosthenes in Lept. 59) resulted in a Lacedaemonian victory;
and no contingent suffered so severely as the Athenian, which was assailed both in front and on the flank by the Spartan troops.
And shortly afterwards Agesi­ laus won another victory in the well­ contested battle of Coronea.
No wonder that the Athenians were disgusted, ἤχθοντο, at this discomfiture of the League from which they had expected so much.
The historical allusions contained in this second section of Praxagora's speech are considered more fully in the Introduction.196.
ὁ τοῦτ᾽ ἀναπείσας]
Κόνωνα λέγει, says the Scholiast;
a very natural mistake, since Conon was the author of all the abiding benefits which the Athenians derived from theAnti-Spartan League.
He broke the naval power of Sparta in the battle of Cnidus, swept the Lacedaemonian garrisons from the isles of the Aegean, and returned home, a second Themistocles, to rebuild the Long Walls of Athens and the forti­ fications of Peiraeus.
But far from being the orator who induced them to enter into the League, he was not even in Athens at the time.
From the disaster at Aegospotami until his triumphant return to Athens some months after the exhibition of this play, he had been continuously in the service of Evagoras of Cyprus or the Persian King.
Nor did he ever fall under the censure of the Athenians.
The allusion here is doubtless to the most persuasive of the many speakers (πάμπολλοι ξυνηγόρευον, Xen. Hell. iii. 5. 16) who advocated the formation of the League.
It cannot have been Thrasybulus, who seems to have been very cautious and undecided in the matter, and whose case is mentioned seven lines below.
It was some orator unnamed by Xenophon.197.
ναῦς δεῖ καθέλκειν]
This was another immediate result of the Anti-Spartan League.
Till then the Athenians, since the surrender of their city to Lysander, had been permitted to maintain twelve triremes and no more, a number doubt­ less sufficient for merely defensiveIt seemed the only thing to save the state.
Yet when they'd got it, they disliked it.
He Who pushed it through was forced to cut and run.

purposes.
But so soon as they had recovered their independence, their first object would be to increase their fleet;
and accordingly, a year or two later, we find them in possession of very considerable naval armaments.
At Athens the duty of equipping a trireme was not, as a rule, performed at the public expense, but was imposed upon some wealthy citizen, so that the in­ crease of the fleet was not always a matter for rejoicing with the richer classes, ἐβαροῦντο γὰρ ταῖς τριηραρχίαις, as the Scholiast says.
As to the γεωργοὶ, whether rich or poor, their lands were always exposed to the incursions of an enemy, and they were consequently al­ ways averse to war.
" Had Attica been an island, and the Athenians masters of the sea," says Xenophon (De Rep. Ath. ii. 14), “they would have escaped all the evils of war:
νῦν δὲ οἱ γεωργοῦντες καὶ οὶ πλούσιοι ᾽Αθηναίων ὑπέρχοιται (come under the power of, are exposed to) τοὺς πολεμίους μᾶλλον.”
The terms δοκεῖ and οὐ δοκεῖ relate to the voting of the different classes in the Assembly, and, to a member of Oxford or Cam­ bridge, are well represented in Le Fevre's Latin translation by placet and non placet.200.
καὶ σὺ νῦν κ.τ.λ.]
The Corinthians, whose animosity to Athens had been the immediate occasion of the Peloponnesian War, and who throughout, and at the termination of, the war, had shown themselves her most rancorous enemies, were nevertheless amongst the earliest to join, and the most eager in supporting, the Anti-Spartan League.
But in the second year of the League, the war was transferred into the territory of Corinth, which was systematically desolated by sword and fire.
A large minority of her citizens became desirous of returning to the Spartan alliance;
we hear of the gates of the city being closed against the fugitives after the battle of Corinth;
and it may possibly be inferred from the present passage that there was a recrudescence at Athens of the old anti-Corinthian feeling.
Praxagora therefore, not now merely stating facts, but giving her own opinion, ex­ horts them to meet the friendly dis­ position of Corinth with equal friendli­ ness.
Praxagora, giving instances of the muta­ bility and perversity of Athenian opinion, says, Ye thought Argeius a blockhead, and yet ye think Hieronymus clever.
Whether their characters are reversed, as the Scholiast-thinks, or whether they were both rude and ignorant men, it is im­ possible to say.
Argeius as a proper name occurs in Xenophon's Hellenics and elsewhere.
Hieronymus was a common Athenian name, and it is very unlikely that Praxagora is referring, as Paulmier supposes, to the officer whom Conon, on his departure for Babylon, left in part command of the Persian and allied navy in Cyprus.
The Hierony­ mus mentioned here was doubtless some obscure politician in Athens.
The line appears to be introduced, after the manner of Aristophanes, and like the reference to Aesimus a few lines below, to touch a lighter chord in the midst of Praxagora's serious arraignment of Athenian policy.
202.
Σωτηρία]
Σωτηρία is personified here as Salus in the Latin proverbial expression " Nec Salus nobis saluti jam esse, si cupiat, potest," Plautus, Mostel­ laria, ii.
1. 4;
Captivi, iii. 3. 14;
Cistel­ laria, iv. 2. 76.
The expression is used also by Terence and Cicero, and doubt­ less was borrowed from them by the Elizabethan statesman Davison, when he addressed his queen as one whom Salvation itself is not able to save, if these purposes are continued.

The mean­ ingof παρακίπτειν is well illustrated by the invocation in Peace 978 seq., where Peace is adjured not merely just to show her face and withdraw it again (παρακύπτειν), but to reveal herself in her full and perfect beauty to the gaze of her devoted admirers, ἀπόφηνον ὅλην σαυτήν.
Cf. Thesm. 797-9.
A glimpse of Safety was afforded to the Athenians by the Anti- Spartan League and the victory of Conon at Cnidus, but this, in the opinion of Praxagora, was more or less counter­ balanced by the growing alienation of the people from the counsels of Thrasybulus, who had brought them σωτρίηία in even darker days than these.
203.
Θρασύβουλος]
Thrasybulus him­ self, not now called upon for advice, is banished from our counsels.
It is clear that before the death of Thrasybulus his influence and popularity at Athens had been for some time on the wane.
He did not distinguish himself, either as a general or as a soldier, at the battle of Corinth:
and shortly after­ wards, and apparently about the date of this comedy, Lysias, in the speech com­ posed for Mantitheus, indulges in aSafety just showed her face:
but Thrasybulus, No more called in, is quite excluded now.1st W. Here's a shrewd man I PRAX.
Ah, now you praise me rightly.
Ye are to blame for this, Athenian people, Ye draw your wages from the public purse,gird at " our grand Steirian," on which he would not have ventured, had he not felt confident that the sneer would be relished by his auditors.
Meanwhile Agyrrhius was supplanting him as a popular favourite:
and not long after the date of the play, Conon was at Athens, restoring the Long Walls and the fortifications of Peiraeus, and devising large schemes, which extended from Asia Minor to Sicily, for the rehabilita­ tion of the Athenian empire.
It is quite possible that this adventurous policy, devised by an officer in the Persian service, aided by a Persian satrap, and only feasible by means of Persian ships and Persian gold, was unpalatable to Thrasybulus, and at the same time quite eclipsed, in the minds of the Athenians, his more sober and moderate counsels.
It was a repetition of the rivalry of Themistocles and Aristides some eighty years before.
A year or two later Thrasybulus left Athens, with a fleet of forty triremes, and seems to have done much good work along the coast of Asia Minor from Byzantium to the river Eurymedon.
Whilst his fleet was moored in that river, he received an order re­ calling him and his colleagues to Athens to meet a charge of embezzlement:
but before he could obey the order he was slain by the citizens of Aspendus, who were incensed by wrongs inflicted upon them by his troops.
His colleague Ergocles, returning to stand his trial, was found guilty and put to death.
We still have the speech, or part of the speech, composed by Lysias against Ergocles :
and it is painful to read the language which the orator permitted himself to use about Thrasybulus, his own benefactor, and still more painful to reflect that, in his opinion, such language was calculated to further his cause before the Athenian dicastery.
Thrasybulus, he says, did well to die as he did:
for it was not fitting that he should live:
neither teas it fitting that he should die at your hands, whom he is thought to hare benefited somewhat in other days.
The Scholiast's statement οὑτος αὑθάδης καὶ δωροδόκος, ὑπερόπτης ὤν τοῦ δήμου, ἠβούλετο δι᾽ αὐτοῦ πάντα πάντ­ τεσθαι, may well have been based upon some other speech made on this occasion, and the final clause doubtless refers to his standing aloof from the far-reaching schemes of Conon.
άρίζεται, like ύπερο­ ρίζεται, means is banished (ὑπερώριστ᾽ ἃν ἢ ἀπέθανεν would have been banished or put to death, Aesch. against Ctesiphon, 253), though here it signifies banishment, not from the territory, but from the counsels, of the state.

Aesimus is described by the Scholiast as χωλὸς, ἄτιμος and ἀμαθὴς, and if he deserved the two latter epithets, he can hardly be the distinguished citizen of that name of whom Lysias speaks (Against Agoratus, 86, 87).211.
ἐν ταῖς αἰκίαις]
Lysistrata, as Bergler observes, employs precisely the same argument for precisely the same purpose in the play bearing her name, 493-5:
LYS.
We will ourselves be the treasurers now.
MAG.
You, woman, you be the treasurers?
LYS.
Certainly.
Ahi, you esteem us unable, perchance!
Are we not skilled in domestic economy ?
Do we not manage the household finance ?
It is plain from these passages that the wife had charge of the household money, and managed the domestic ex­ penses.216.
βάπτουσι]
It is surprising that the Scholiast and all the commentators should take Praxagora to mean " they rinse their wools in boiling water";
the Scholiast explaining βάπτουσι by πλύνουσι, and the recognized LatinYet each man seeks his private gain alone.
So the state reels, like any Aesimus.

That they are better in their ways than we I'll soon convince you.
First, they dye their wools
With boiling tinctures, in the ancient style.
You won't find them, I warrant, in a hurry Trying new plans.
ADd would it not have saved The Athenian city had she let alone Things that worked well, nor idly sought things new ?translation haring always been "lanas lavant aqua calida."
For ἔρια βαπτὰ are dyed wools, wools dyed by boiling them in the liquid which was to give them the required colouring;
and βάπτειν ἔρια here can mean nothing else than to dye their wools.
"The best seaweed," says Theophrastus (Hist. Plant, iv. 6. 5), " is found on the rocks of Crete, ᾧ βάπτουσιν ἔρια.”
And in the eighth section of the same chapter, χρήσιμον ἡ δρῦς εἰς βαφὴν ἐρίων ταῖς γυναιξίν.
All will remember Plato's famous comparison, in the fourth book of the Republic, of education with the process of dyeing, which commences219.
εἴ πού τι]
I have accepted Dobree's suggestion of εἴ πού τι for εἰ τοῦτο, but I cannot accept his interpretation of it, viz.
“If anything had happened to be in the best possible order, the Athenians would think the country could never be saved till that was altered."
Praxagora is arguing that the women are the safest persons to guide the fortunes of Athens, because when they have got a good custom, they do not forsake it to seek after novelties;
and she gives the homely instance of their treatment τῶν ἐρίων.
And would not Athens, she asks, be safe, if when she has anything which works -well she did not idly seek some novel substitute ?
And so, I think, the Scholiast understood the passage:
tl ἐφύλαττε τὸν ἀρχαῖον νόμον, εἰ μὴ ἐπολυ­ πραγμόνει καὶ καινὰς ἔφερε πολιτείας.221.
φρύγουσι] Λείπι τὸ τρίχας.—
Scho­ liast.
"I will take my oath," says Le Fevre, " that the Scholiast wrote κριθάς."
And this suggestion, so emphatically recommended, is universally accepted.222.
ἀπὶ τῆς κεφςλῆς]
They carry their burdens (such as a pitcher or a basket) not, after the manner of men, on their shoulders or in their hands, but poised upon their heads.
So the κανηφόρ

so the Irish peasant girls may be seen to-day, carrying their pitchers from the well.
The custom has always been affected by women, partly no doubt because it is known to lend to the female figure a singular elasticity and uprightness of carriage.
Herodotus, indeed, as Bergler observes, mentions as one of the points in which the Egyptians differed from all other peoples, that, amongst them, τὰ άχθεα οί μέν άνδρες έπέ κεфαλέων фορέ- ουσι, αί δὲ γυναῖκες ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων.

They keep their Thesmophoria, as of old :
They bake their honied cheesecakes, as of old ;
They victimize their husbands, as of old :
They still secrete their lovers, as of old:
They buy themselves sly dainties, as of old :
They love their wine unwatered, as of old:
They like a woman's pleasures, as of old :
Then let us, gentlemen, give up to them The helm of state, and not concern ourselves, Nor pry, nor question what they mean to do;
But let them really govern, knowing this, The statesman-mothers never will neglect Their soldier-sons.
And then a soldier's rations, Who will supply as well as she who bare him ?
For ways and means none can excel a woman.
And there's no fear at all that they'll be cheatedwhere also several treatises περὶ πλα­ κούντων are incidentally mentioned.
They werewheaten (or sometimes barley) cakes, flavoured with various rich sub­ stances such as wine and oil and cheese;
but honey seems to have been the special ingredient which distinguished them from ordinary cakes:
and the superiority of the Attic πλακοῦς was attributed to the superiority of the Attic honey.
Athe­ naeus (iii. 59) cites some lines to this effect from Archestratus, the laureate of epicures:
Also a rich honey-cake From Athens be sure that you get us;
If it come not from thence you must take Some honey obtained from Hymettus To give it the flavour which makes The Attic the proudest of cakes.
The same inference may be drawn from the answer of Demonax to one who asked him if he ate πλακοῦντας.
What, think you, said he, that bees make their honey­ combs for fools only ?
—Lucian, Demonax, 52. And cf. Athenaeus, x, chap. 70.240. διάξετε]
With these words Praxa­ gora lays aside her wreath, the BE- HEABSAL is concluded, and the women relapse into their ordinary style of con­ versation.243.
ἐν ταῖς φυγαῖς]
The Scholiast refers these words to the banishments and proscriptions inflicted by the Thirty;
and Dobree, concurring in this view, refers to Plato's Apology, chap.
v, where the Platonic Socrates, commending the loyalty of Chaerephon to the democracy, says ξυνέφυγε τὴν φυγὴν ταύτην, καὶ μεθ' ύμῶν κατῆλθε ;
and where Riddell cites Isocrates de Pace 149, τὰς φυγὰς τὰς ἐπὶ τῶν τυράννων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τριάκοντα γενο­ μένας.
But the Scholiast'e notion that fugitives from the Thirty would en­ deavour to conceal themselves by flock­ ing to the Pnyx, one of the most public and exposed places in Athens, is ob­ viously untenable;
and beyond all ques­ tion Praxagora is speaking, not of a general flight from Athens, but of a general flight into Athens.
Paulmier therefore refers the passage to the crowding of the country people into the city at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. ii. 17) :
and this explanation is now generally ac­ cepted.
But besides the extreme im­ probability that a young woman like Praxagora should represent herself as fleeing into Athens with her husband nearly forty years before, and having at that remote period acquired the rhe­ torical powers which she is now for the first time putting into practice, it must be remembered that the greater part of the audience had probably been born since that date, and that even amongst the elder spectators the memory of those distant days must have grown faint and dim in comparison with the momentous events which had recently occurred at Athens.
And in my opinion the flight to which Praxagora is alluding is the flight of the Athenians from the islands and seaports into the city before the conquering progress of Lysander.
We know that after his great success at Aegospotami, he passed round the coasts
When they're in power, for they're the cheats themselves.
Much I omit.
But if you pass my motion, You'll lead the happiest lives that e'er you dreamed of.1st W. 0, good!
Praxagora.
Well done, sweet wench.
However did you learn to speak so finely ?
PRAX.
I and my husband in the general flight Lodged in the Pnyx, and there I heard the speakers.
1st W. Ah, you were clever to some purpose, dear.
And if you now succeed in your designs
We'll then and there proclaim you chieftainess.
But what if Cephalus, ill fare, insult you,and islands, and compelled all the Athe­ nians he found, whether garrisons or private individuals, to return to Athens on pain of death;
συνήλαυνεν ἅπαντας εὶς τὸ ἅστυ, is Plutarch's expression (Ly­ sander, 13);
ς, says Xenophon, ὅτι, ὅσῳ ἅν πλείους συλλεγῶσιν ἐς τὸ ἄστυ καὶ toy Πειραιᾶ, θᾶττον τῶν ἐπιτηὄείων ἔνὄειαν ἔσεσθαι (Hellenics, ii.2.2).
These streams of fugitives converging from all quarters into Athens must have brought about a situation very similar to that of B. C. 431.
It is to this immigration at the close, and not to that at the beginning, of the Pelo­ ponnesian War that Praxagora's state­ ment refers.
248.
κέΦαλος]
Now comes a little scurrilous dialogue of twenty lines, criti­ cizing some little-known speakers, and making sundry jokes which the audience may have relished, but which have no interest for ourselves.
We learn from the present passage that this Cephalus united the callings of a demagogue and a potter:
and be is doubtless the orator of that name who is mentioned by Ando­ cides, Deinarchus, and Demosthenes.
The Scholiast indeed says be is not;
δημαγωγὸς οὔτος ἔτερος, οὐχ δν λέγει Δημο­ σθένης, ἀλλὰ λοίδορ
ος ;
but I doubt if he had any ground for his assertion except that the orator is praised by Demo­ sthenes.
Yet so is Agyrrhius, see the note on 102 supra;
and apparently the two are coupled together by Plato Comicus;
see Plutarch's Praecepta Ge­ rendae Reipublicae, iv. προσΦθαρεὶς is always used in a bad sense.
Dr. Blaydes aptly refers to Aelian (V. H. xiv. 26), who says that a railing poet έλοιρεῖτο the philosopher Arcesilaus, προσΦθαρεὶς airy.
So we are told that evil companions προσΦθείρονται τῷ νεανίσκῳ whom St. John had committed to the charge of the Bp. of Ephesus "in the sight of Christ and His Church."
—Eusebius, H. E. iii. 23.
The first two retorts of Praxagora rrapa­ Φρονεῖν αὐτὸν and μελαγχολᾱν are con­sidered insufficient, since they merely mention facts which all the citizens know.
Praxagora therefore tries a third, viz. that he is a better politician than potter.
This they don't know, and her questioner therefore, accepting this answer, passes on to another subject.
ἀκαθαρίας.—Scholiast.
It seems to be expected that he will take a prominent part in the Assembly, and he was prob­ ably therefore at this time one of the regular speakers, τῶν ἠθάδων, there.
Ac­ .
cordingly we find him the very first to speak in the debate, infra 398.
In the Plutus we see him lying in the Temple of Asclepius, hoping to be cured of his blindness:
he is there described as τυΦλὸς, but keener to thieve than those who can see.
—Plutus 665.255. ἐς κυνὸς πυγὴν όρᾶν] Παροιμία παι­ δικὴ ἐπὶ τῶν ὀΦθαλμιώντν' ἐς κυνὸς πυγὴν ὁρᾶν καὶ τριῶν ἀλωπέκων.- Scholiast.
If εἴπον is the correct reading it seems to me that either the entire line must be a proverbial saying (cf. 772 infra and the note there), or else Praxagora must be speaking as if the actual assembly, and not merely the rehearsal, were just concluded.
The use of the aorist in a present signification (see Hermann's Viger, p. 734;
Elmsley on Medea 266;
Bp. Monk on Hipp. 1403) has no applica­ tion to the present passage, where, on the ordinary interpretation, an aorist would be used in a future signification, to my mind an impossible usage.
Dindorf takes εἴπον to be an imperative, a sugges-How will you answer him in full Assembly ?
PRAX.
I'll say he's frenzied.
1st W. True enough;
but all
The world know that.
PRAX.
I'll say he's moody-mad.1st W. They know that too.
PRAM.
That he's more fit to tinker
The constitution than his pots and pans.
1st W. If Neocleides, blear-eyed oaf, insult you?
PRAX.
Peep at a puppy's tail, my lad, quoth I.1st W. What if they Interrupt?
PRAX.
I'll meet them there, I'm quite accustomed to that sort of thing.
1st W. 0 but suppose the archers hale you off, What will you do ?
PRAX.
Stick out my elbows, so.
They shan't seize me, the varlets, round my waist.
SEMICH.
Aye, and we'll help:
we'll bid the men let go.1st W. Then that we've settled, wonderfully well.
But this we've not considered, how to mindtion which, as Fritzsche, who agrees with him, truly observes (de Pelargis, p. 90), necessitates the transference of the line to the second woman.
But it is im­ possible to suppose that Praxagora would have no remark whatever to make with regard to Neocleides.256.
ὑποκρούωσιν]
The speaker uses the word in its common sense of " inter- rupting " an orator, cf. infra 588, 596;
Ach. 38;
Lucian, Be Somnio, 17;
but Praxagora takes it in the sense it bears infra 618, a sense continued in the κρου­ μάτων of the following line.
Hence προσ­ κινήσομαι, as in Lys. 227, 228.259.
ἐξαγκωνιῶ]
Neither the sense of the passage nor the composition of the word will admit of the explanation given by the Scholiast and Suidas, ιοὐς ἀγκῶνας ύπὸ Tant πλευραῖς πιήσω.
It means the reverse, I will stick out my elbows, stand with my arms akimbo.261. ἤν αἴρωσ']
This line, which is usually given to one of the women on the stage, I have transferred to the semi­ chorus.
If the archers lift her up bodily, αἴρωσι, sublimem rapiant, then, they say, it will be OUR turn to act;
then WE will-Do what?
Fling ourselves into the fray?
Fly to your rescue?
Not at all.
We will bid them let you be.
The last two words are used 'rapa προσ­ δοκίαν.
The emphatic ἡμεῖς at the corn.
mencement of the line gave promise of some stern and vigorous resolve, and no one could have supposed that they were going to act after the manner of a tragic Chorus;
to utter helpless counsels and unavailing admonitions and to leave their leader to fight the battle by herself.264.
ιὰς χεῖρας αἴρειν]
The voting in the Assembly was by show of hands, χειμοτονία, and Kuster observes that the formula with which the κῆρυξ put the question to the vote is preserved by the Scholiast on Aesch.
SuppL 629 'Αράιω τὰς χεῖρας, ὄτῳ ταῦτα δοκεῖ.
With αἴρειν τὼ σκελη compare Lys. 229.
The manner of voting is clearly described three lines below, ἐξωμισάσαις τὸν ἔτερν βραχίονα, where ἔτερον of course means simply "one," as'in 162 supra, 498 infra, and passim.
The double signification of ó ἔτερος one of the two and the other is very neatly exemplified by a passage in Lucian's Hermotimus (37).
If there were but two men in the temple, says Hermo­ timus, when the sacred cup was stolen, we must discover which of them has got it, for certainly one of the two has it όπό­ τερ
ος ἔχει τὴν Φιάλην, ἔχει δὲ πάντως ὁ ἔτερος.
If then we find it on the first, we shall not search the other τὸν ἔτερ
ον, for evidently he has not got it;
while if we do not find it on the first, the other has certainly got it ὁ ἔτερ
ος πάντως ext.
Here we are told that beyond all doubt 6 ἔτερ
ος (in the one sense) has it, and in the same breath that whether ὁ ἔτερ
ος (in the other sense) has it or not, depends upon the result of investigation.
ἐξω­ μισάσαις is explained by the Scholiast ἅχρι τῶν ὤμων γ
υμνωσάσαις.268. ἅγε νυν]
Praxagora, turning to the semichorus, gives them her final injunctions as to the manner in whichWe lift our hands, and not our feet, in voting.
We're more for lifting feet than lifting hands.
PRAX.
A knotty point.
However we must each
Hold up one arm, bare from the shoulder, so.
Now then, my dears, tuck up your tunics neatly, And slip your feet in those Laconian shoes, Just as ye've seen your husbands do, whenever They're going out, mayhap to attend the Assembly.
And next, so soon as everything is right With shoes and tunics, fasten on your beards, And when ye've got them neatly fitted on, Then throw your husbands' mantles over all, Those which ye stole;
and leaning on your sticks
Off to the meeting, piping as ye go Some old man's song, and mimicking the ways
Of country fellows.
1st W. Good I but let ourselves
Get on before them :
other women soonthey are to wear their husbands' clothes, and march off to attend the Assembly.
They are to gather up the long body­ robe, which being the husband's would probably be too long for the wife;
and over this to throw the himation or outer mantle.
They are to put on their bus­ bands' red Laconian shoes and tie their beards carefully round their chins, and then to start off, leaning on their sticks and singing in chorus some favourite old song.
As we listen to her words, we seem to catch a vivid glimpse of the streets of old Athens in the early morning, with groups of citizens and yeomen marching along them, some to the dicasteries (Wasps 219 and note there), and others to the Assembly, Is stout-hearted citizens singing one song."280. προἴμεν αὐτῶν]
The semichorus are ready to start, and the first woman says "
Let us [that is, the three leaders] go on before them."
Meineke strangely observes "
Non apparet quo pertineat αὐτῶν;
ad rusticas illas, dices, quas in sequentibus commemorat," and he pro­ poses to amend the passage.
I should not have supposed that any person of sound mind could have entertained so absurd an opinion as that which Meineke imputes to his readers had it not already been propounded by Lenting, who says "
Eas mulieres dicit, quas inox dicit sese credere ad forum venturas.
Pronomen igitur airis, quod perraro fit, non adnomen quod praecessit sed ad sequens referendum est."
It is plain that both Lenting and Meineke have altogether failed to appreciate the proceedings on the stage and in the orchestra.281. ἅντικρυς]
Straight to the Pnyx, without coming to the rendezvous to which the twelve city dames had re­ sorted.
They do, indeed, pass through the theatre, but without stopping, enter­ ing no doubt from the eastern side, as ἀπὸ ἀγρῦ, and leaving by the western side, as to the town.
See Haigh's Attic Theatre, iv. 3.285. ὤρα προβαίνειν]
The first four lines, iambic tetrameter catalectics, are spoken by the coryphaeus, as the semi­ chorus are about to move out of the orchestra.
This is the only instance, in these comedies, of what is called a Μετάστασις (Pollux, iv. segm. 108), that is to say, the temporary departure of the Chorus in the middle of a play, leaving the orchestra vacant till their return.
But it is found in the Helen of Euripides, and some other tragic dramas.
See Haigh's Attic Theatre, vi. 4.289. χωρῶμεν κ.τ.λ.]
Τοῦτ' torιτὸ μέλος δ εἴπεν ἔνδον αὐταῖς, TO ἀγροικικόν.- Scholiast
The strophe, from χωρῶμεν to ὀνομάζειν, is sung by the semichorus whom Praxagora has just been instruct­ ing, and who, as we have seen, represent the dwellers in the city.
They are following Praxagora and the two other leaders to the Pnyx, and are chiefly anxious, as we might have anticipated, to avoid all suspicion of being women dressed up as men.
Hence they call themselves by men's names, Charitimi­ des and the like, not alluding to any individuals of that name, any more than Praxagora was, when she called one of her friends, Ariphrades, supra 129.
The strophe consists of twenty-one lines, the first being a compound iambo­ trochaic, very similar to that discussed in the note to Wasps 248, but with an additional syllable at the end.
The other twenty lines are glyconic, fifteen being acatalectic, and five (the fourth, the ninth, the twelfth, the sixteenth,Will come I know from all the countryside Straight for the Pnyx.

That whoever shall fail toand the twentieth) catalectic, or having a syllable short.
The acatalectic line consists of a long or short syllable, followed by a choriamb and an iamb, | The catalectic line is the same, with the final syllable omitted.
The last syllable of the catalectic line may be either long or short, and so in my opinion, notwith­ standing the great authority of Dawes and Gaisford to the contrary, may, though very rarely, the last syllable of the acatalectic be.
In other words, though the last foot of the acatalectic is almost invariably an iamb, yet a pyrrhic is not absolutely inadmis­ sible.
We have one instance in this very strophe, where the sixth glyconic line ends with τρώβολον, and the seventh commences with a vowel, and another in Peace 1351.
It is possible however that this licence is taken only at the end of a paragraph, where there is a natural pause.
For other examples of the same metre, Gaisford (Hephaestion, chap. xi, note) refers to Knights 1111- 50, Peace 1329 to the end, Birds 1731- 41 and Frogs 450-3 and 456-9.290.

The introduction of payment for attendance at the ἐκκλησία necessitated the use of a ticket, which was probably given to each ecclesiast at the opening of the Assembly, and on the production of which, after the Assembly was broken up, he would be paid the three-obol.
But no particulars of the subject are known.298. φίλας]

Before the singers of the strophe, the γυναȋκες ἐξ ἄϭτεως, have quite cleared out of the theatre, the ἔτεραι γυναίκες ἐκ τω̑ν ἀγρω̑ν (supra 280-2) come swinging in, and apparently, at first, there is a little hustling between the two parties.
The newcomers are also twelve in number, and form the second semichorus, who sing the anti strophe, from ὄρα δ' ὄπως to πηλοφου̑ιτες.
They bad not been present at Praxagora's instructions, and whether for that reason, or more pro­ bably because Aristopbanes was glad of the opportunity for giving his own view of the institution of the τριώβολον ἐκκληϭιαϭτικὸν, there is not a word in their song to indicate that they were really women in disguise.
They come in as honest and hearty yeomen, cast­ ing scorn on the town crew (the firstsemichorus) who serve the state for pay.302.
ὀβολόν]
We have already seen (on 102 supra) that the ἐκκλησιαστικὸν originally instituted by Agyrrhius was one obol only ;
but after the loss of their empire the Athenians grew so listless about public affairs that a single obol was insufficient to bring them to the Pnyx:
they preferred to lounge and gossip amongst the wreaths, that is, in the wreath-market ἐν τοίς στεφανώ μασιν.
Dobree refers to the lines which Athenaeus, xv. 82, quotes from the 'Αγαθοὶ, a comedy attributed by some to Pherecrates and by others to Strattis, • The last two substantives are the names of plants.
And cf.Tbesm.

However all this apathy was changed by the introduction of the three-obol ἐκκλησιασ­ τικόν.

As the last notes of the singers die away in the distance, the central door in the background opens and a singular figure makes its appear­ ance ;
a sturdy citizen, clad in a woman's yellow robe, and wearing a woman's slippers.
He turns out to be Blepyrus, the husband of Praxagora, reduced to these extremities because his own gar­ ments have, as the spectators are aware, been abstracted by his wife.
We have seen Praxagora masquerading in her husband's clothes:
we now see her husband masquerading in hers.

Gown.
It is after­ wards called a κροκωτίδιον (332) and a χιτώνιον (374), and was a yellow body­ robe, reaching from the shoulder to the ground, and doubled down from the shoulder to the waist.
It was the inner garment, which a woman was said ἐν­ δύεσθαι;
in contrast to the loose outer mantle, called an ἔγκυκλον infra 586, which she was said περιβάλλεσθαι, toBLEPYRUS.
What's up?
Where's my wife gone?
Why bless the woman, It's almost daybreak and she can't be found.
Here am I, taken with the gripes abed, Groping about to find my overcloke
And shoes i' the dark;
but hang it, they're gone too :
I could not find them anywhere.
Meanwhile Easums kept knocking hard at my back-door;
So on I put this kirtle of my wife's,
And shove my feet into her Persian slippers.

or shall I say All are alike convenient in the dark ?
No man can see me here, I am sure of that.
Fool that I was, worse luck, to take a wife
In my old age.

'Tis for no good.
I warrant, that she's out

However, I can't wait.

The particular:
of a woman's apparel are described in Thesm.
249-262. The diminutives used in refer­ ence to Praxagora's robe are probably designed to show how scanty it was when worn by Blepyrus.820.
ἐν καθαρῳ̃]
A place clear of people ;
a retired place where I shall be out of the way of passers-by.
The Scholiast explains it by ἐν ἐρημἰᾳ.
The words οὐδεὶς ὄψεται two lines below are of course intended for a joke, Blepyrus being in full sight of the whole audience.327.
τίς ἐστιν;
]
Another door opens, and another husband comes out.
The door is that which Praxagora " gently scratched," supra 34, and the man is the husband of the second woman.
He, like Blepyrus, has been left in a destitute condition by the disappearance of his ordinary garments;
but not having the same urgent reason for immediately leaving his house, he has found time to array himself in another tunic.
He is therefore unprepared for the sight of Blepyrus, wrapped in Praxagora's yellow robe, and is at first disposed to think that Cinesias, notorious for having be­ fouled a shrine of Hecate (Frogs 366 and the note there), had performedthe same operation on the person of Blepyrus.333.
ἰμάτιον]
The ἱμάτιον was of course to be thrown over, and not to form a substitute for, the ἠμιδιπλοίδιον.
The man's χιτὼν and ἱμάτιον corresponded to the woman's κροκωτὸς and ἔγκυκλον. Praxagora had abstracted both the former articles, and left the latter in their stead.
Her κροκωτὸς was now .
adorning her husband's person;
her ἔγκυκλον had been thrown over his bed, infra 586.837.
ἐκτετρύπηκεν]
Λάθρᾳ ἐξη̑λθεν. — Scholiast;
and so in substance Hesy­ chius.
τρύπημα is a hole, and ἐκτρυπάω in strictness means “ to bore one's way out through some hole or cranny."
The t with which the following line com­ mences is equivalent, as Kuster observes, to δι’ δ, wherefore.
With that line itself Brunck compares Eur. Med. 37 δέδοικα δ’ αὐτὴν, μή τι βουλεύῃ νέον.840. ᾒ ξύνειμ’ ἐγώ]
So the husband of the second woman describes his wife, and so in line 38 supra she had described him ῳ̒̑ ξύνειμ’ ἐγώ.
The coincidence of phrase is noticed by Bergler.
Sure and it's he himself.
Why tell me, man, What's all that yellow ?

With τὰς ἐμβάδας we must repeat ἔχουσα from the preceding line.
845. Λακωνικάς] " Atqui supra 314 dice­ bat rat ἐμβάδας ζηω̑ν.
Distinguuntur autem hac duo dare in Vespis 1157 ἄγε νυ̑ν ἀποδύου τὰς καταράτ
ους ἐμβάδας, τασδὶ δ’ ἀνύσας ὑπόδυθι τὰς Λακωνικάς.
”-Bergler.
But this is an error, such as we rarely find in the notes of that excellent com­ mentator.
For although the word ἐμ­ βάδες, standing alone, generally signifies common, ordinary shoes, as infra 633,850, &c. (εὐτελὲς ὑπόδημα, Pollux, vii. segm 85), yet it is also a generic term, and is in truth the very substantive understood with such feminine.
as Λακωνικαὶ, Περσι­ καὶ, and the like.
See the note on Wasps 1163.
And the contrast in Wasps 1157 is not between ἐμβάδας and Λακνικὰς, but between τὰς κακαράτ
ους ἐμβάδας, it the infernal shoes" which the old man was wearing, and τὰς Λακωνικὰς ἐμβάδας " the fashionable red shoes" with which his son was endeavouring to invest him.
In this very play the words ἐμβάδες and Λακωνικαὶ are incessantly interchanged:
see lines 47, 74, 269, 314, 342, 345, 508, and 542.
Lucian (Pseudologista, 19) speaks of an ostentatious personage as wearing χρυσα̑ς ἐμβάδας καὶ ἐσθη̑τα τυ­ ραννικήν.349.

Funem cacas.
,aura δὲ λέγει, says the Scholiast, ὡς αὐτου̑ μακρὰ ἀποπατου̑ντος καὶ χέζοντος.
Some have supposed that ἱμονιὰν is to be taken adverbially, on the ground that ἀποπατει̃ν is an intransitive verb.
But verbs of the class to which mro­ πατει̑ in Greek and " to spit" in English belong are intransitive only when the accusative which would follow is in­ volved in the verb itself;
as ἀποπατείν [ἀπόπατον] and " to spit [spittle]."
But when what you ἀποπατει̃ς is not ἀπόπατος, or what you spit is not spittle, an accusa­ tive is properly added, as ἀποπατει̑ν ἱμο­ νιὰνοτ “to spit blood."
Blepyrus explains in his answer that his neighbour has mis­ taken the cause of his protracted session.354.
κἄγωγε]
He speaks as if his neigh­ hour had said "
I am going to the As­ sembly " instead of "
It is full time for me to go."355.
ἀχράς]
The Scholiasts say, artνω­ anιν τῃ̑ γαστρὶ παρέχει, ἐπέχει τὴν γαστέρα ή ἀχράς.
Galen too notices its astringent qualities.
ἀχράδες στύφουσι μα̑λλον τω̑ν ἄλλων anίων, he says De Simplicibus Medicamentorum facultatibus, vi. 1. 52.
The ἀχρὰς is the wild pear, the fruit of the wild pear tree, which is called by Linnaeus, and generally since his time, pirus communis, but was formerly called also pirus achras.
The tree itself was by the Greeks called indifferently ἄχερδος (ἀχρὰς, ὁ καρπὸς τη̑ς ἀχέρδου Bekker's Anecdota, i. 475;
Leake's Topography of Athens, ii. 185) or ἀχράς.
The latter form is invariably adopted by Theo­ phrastus, who in his History of Plants is constantly contrasting the ἀχρὰς with the ἄπιος or garden pear, just as he does the ἐρινεὸς with the συκη̑ (the wild and the cultivated fig tree) and the κότινος with the έλαία (the wild and the culti­ vated olive tree).
Thus in i. 8 he notes that the wild tree has more branchesFor fear I soil my blanket;
'twas a clean one.

CIT.
As Thrasybulus told the Spartans, eh ?than the cultivated tree, οἷον κότινος ἐλαίας, καὶ ἐρινεὸς ϭυκη̑ς, καὶ ἀχρἀς ἀπίου.
And he brings forward the same six trees in iv.
13 as illustrations of the greater longevity of the wild species.
In i. 4 he observes that the fruit of a wild tree is superior in quantity, but inferior in quality, to that of the culti­ vated, and he instances the κότινος and the ὰχράς.
Again in ii.
2 he says that trees propagated by slips retain their quality, but those propagated by seeds degenerate, as ἐκ τῶν ὰπίων [φύεται] μοχ­ θηρὰ ἡ ἀχράς.
The wild-pear tree, the mother of all the orchard and garden varieties, is thorny," as is observed in Miller and Martyn's Gardener's Dic­ tionary, s.v. pyrus.
And its thorny shoots were by the ancient Greeks wattled into fences and sometimes placed as a coping on walls, to prevent any clambering over from within or without.
Thus, in Odyssey xiv.
10 Eumaeus is described as having built a stone wall and coped it with wild-pear branches, καὶ ἐθρίγκωϭεν ἀχέρ­ δῳ;
where the Scholiast explains ὰχέρδῳ by τῇ ἀγρίᾳ ἀπίῳ, and adds ἔχουϭι δὲ αὗται ἀκάνθας, δι ὧν a!
αὶμαϭιαὶ (thorn hedges) γίνονται.
It is unlikely that Blepyrus is alluding to this use of the wild-pear tree :
without any allusion of this kind, the word has the double recommenda­ tion of introducing the reference to Thrasybulus, and permitting the forma­ tion of the deme-name 'Αχραδούϭιος.356.
θραϭύβουλος]
The Scholiast tells us that Thrasybulus had promised to speak against a proposed treaty with Sparta, but being bribed by the Spar­ tans excused himself on the ground of a sudden indisposition brought on by eating wild pears;
οὗτος ἀντιλέγειν μέλλων λέγειν.
But it is plain from the language of Aristophanes that the Scholiast has got hold of the wrong end of the story ;
and that Thrasybulus was excusing him­ self to the Lacedaemonians for having broken his promise to them.
It seems probable that this incident occurred in connexion with the Anti-Spartan League.
Thrasybulus may at first have agreed tospeak against the alliance with Thebes;
but afterwards, whether bribed, or (which is more consonant with what we know of his character) being on consideration doubtful whether the alliance might not be for the best interests of his country, he did not deliver his speech, and gave to the disappointed Lacedaemonians the excuse which is mentioned in the text.
The neighbour now goes out, and Ble­ pyrus,left alone, resumes his interrupted soliloquy.357. ἐνέχεται]
Οἷον ἐπίκειται καὶ — Scholiast.
Fritzsche (Quaestiones Aris­ toph. p. 236) thinks that in this place .
" Blepyrus per DionyRum jurat facetis­ sime," since Thrasybulus in Fritzsche's opinion had a brother named Dionysus.
But there would be no point in an allu­ sion of this kind;
and to me it seems obvious that the oath by Dionysus has no more special reference to Thrasy­ bulus here than it had thirteen lines above.
362. 'Αχραδούϭιος]
The name is of course formed from the word ἀχρὰς used above;
but like Κοπρεαῖος, supra 317, it comes close to the name of a real Attic deme, the 'Αχερδούϭιοι. See Leake's Catalogue of the Demi, Topography of Athens, ii.
185.
The deme is mentioned in many inscriptions and by several ancient writers.
To the list given by Leake may now be added Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 38, where Pro­ fessor Bywater's conjecture of 'Αχερ­ δούϭιος for 'Αχέρδους υἱὸς is no doubt correct.
Here the Scholiast says 'Αχρα-364. τῶν καταπρώκτων]

the reading of one inferior MS.
τῶν κατὰ πρωκτὸν has found favour with several very eminent scholars as referring to doctors who had made a special study of the diseases affecting that particular portion of the human body.
But even if any such reference was intended, I cannot doubt that we ought to read καταπρώκτων, the two persons introduced in the succeeding lines being notorious for the vice which that word implies;
just as in the translation the term "pathick" might include an allusion to allopathies, homoeopathics, hydro­ pathics, &c.
The Scholiast describes Amynon as a ῥήτωρ ἡταιρκὼς, and Anti­ sthenes as an :
arpos θηλυδριώδης, καὶ οὗτος, he adds, τῶν καταπρώκτων.
From the word ἀρνήϭεται we may perhaps infer that Amynon had repudiated all know­ ledge of the vice to which he was be­ lieved to be addicted.267. ϭτεναγμάτων] " Quia nimirum inter cacandum difficulter egerat," says Bergler.

’Αμὶς μὲν, ἐν ᾠ οὐροῦσι σκωραμὶς it, ἐν ᾧ ἀποπατοῖσι,—Scholiast.
A σκωραμὶς was, as its name implies, an apit adapted for the reception of σκῶρ.
It bad no doubt a plug, which, when kept in, prevented, and, when removed, permitted, the passage of the σκῶρ.
In this consisted its resemblance to Ble­pyrus, the ὰρχἀς, in his case, operating as the plug.
Cf. supra 860.372. ΧΡΕΜΗΣ]
The misfortune of Blepyrus has detained him so long, that the Assembly is over before he is ready to start for it.
And now Chremes, his other neighbour (see 127 supra-, return­ ing from its proceedings, finds him still in his wife's clothes and still in a dis­ tressing condition.

τονδὶ φέρων]
He points to his empty θίλακον.
I have substituted these words for the τὸν θίλακον of the MSS.
and editions, which in my opinion was originally a gloss on τoνόὶ and has crept into the text, usurping the place of τονδὶ φέρων, and destroying the sense of the passage.
Bergler refers to Wasps 300- 315.384. ὰθρόος]
All keeping together, in one body.
These of course are Praxa­ gora and her friends, whose efforts to acquire a sunburnt appearance (supra 64) seems to have been remarkably un­ successful.
They are likened to shoe­ makers because the latter, from their indoor occupation, escaped the em­ browning influence of Hellenic sun­ shine;
ἐπειδὴ οἱ σκυτοτόμοι, says the Scholiast, ἐν σκιᾷ καθεζόμενοι ἐργάζονται, τοῦτο ε̃φη.
The Scholiast on Peace 1310 (to which Dr. Blaydes refers) cites a proverb οὐδὲν λευκῶν ἀνδρῶν ε̃ργον εἰ μὴ σκυτ

" Cur λευκοπληθὴς videbatur concio?" says Bergler, "nempe quia erat γυναικοπληθὴς, ut loquitur Aesch. in Pers. 125 and Eurip. in Ale. 951."390. τὸ δεύτερον]
After all it must be admitted that a man can exaggerate quite as well as a woman;
supra 33.
For we, who are in the secret, are well aware that the women, who seem to have been the earliest arrivals at the Pnyx, did not leave the very spot at which the present dialogue is taking place until long after the cock had given its second crow.
See supra 31.
For the interrogative πόθεν;
used as a nega­ tive (How should you ?), see the note on 976 infra.392.
’Αντίλοχ’... μᾶλλον]
These (with the substitution of τεθνηκότος for τριω­ βόλου) are the words addressed (in the Myrmidons of Aeschylus) by the sorrow­ ing Achilles to the messenger who had brought him the tidings of his comrade's death.
Weep, Antilochus, Rather for me, the living, than for him, The loved and lost Patroclus.
The Scholiast ends the quotation with μᾶλλον.
Whether the three following words τὰμὰ γὰρ διοίχεται (ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀπό­ λωλα, Scholiast) are really a continua­ tion of it, as Brunck, Person, and Her­ mann think, or are added by Aristo­ pbanes to complete the line, it is im­ possible to determine with confidence.
These lines of Aeschylus were probably in the mind of Euripides when, inNot had you been there when the cock was giving Its second crow.

The first to ascend the bema is Neocleides 6 γλάμων.
We have already heard of this worthy as a speaker in the Assembly, supra 254.
Here he is introduced merely to be dismissed with a jest.
404.
σκόροδ’]
Neocleides, I suppose, meant ‘
What must I do to save the state ?'
Blepyrus would answer him as if he meant , What must I do to cure my disease ?' and accordingly proposes a remedy which was probably in actual use at that time for cases of λήμη.
’λήμη seems to have been a sort of ulcer or tumour (cf. Clouds 327) filling the eyes with an offensive rheum, whence it is sometimes described as ή τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἀκαθαρσία.
—Scholiast at Lys. 301, Hesy­ chius s.v., and see note on 254 supra.
The three ingredients arc garlic, fig-tree juice, and spurge.
Cf. Plutus 718, 719. Garlic is recommended by Galen (Dc Remediis parabilibus, i. 5) as one of the ingredients of a plaster, κατάπλαμα, for diseases of the eye, it being, as Miller and Martyn (Gardener's Dictionary ) say, very beating and penetrating, and useful in suppurating hard tumours.
Of ὀπὸς the Scholiast says, πάνυ γὰρ δριμίτατος ὁ ὀπός.
By the Greek medical writersὀπὸς is used to signify the juice of any plant, but in classical authors it is specially employed of the juice of the fig tree.
See the note on Wasps 353.
“Verjuice,” by which I have translated it, is the juice of the crab apple.
βλέπων ὀπὸν is used in Peace 1184 in the sense of "with a verjuice look."
τιθύμαλλος, euphorbia, our spurge, is described in precisely the same manner by Greek doctors and English botanists.
τιθύ­ μαλλοι πάντες, says Galen (De Simpli­ cibus Medicamentorum facultatibus, viii. 19.
7) ἐπικρατοῦσαν μὲν ε̃χουσι τὴν δριμεῖαν καὶ θερμὴν δύναμιν ὑπάρχει δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ πικρότης.
The pungency is greatest in the juice, ὀπός;
next in the fruit and leaves, and lastly in the root.
He recommends it for toothache, the .
juice being dropped into the hollow tooth, and says that it gets rid of warts and tumours, and dries and cleanses ulcers;
but that if any of it drops on the skin, it raises a blister.
In accord­ ance with this we read in Miller and Martyn, “ The juice of every species of spurge is so acrid that it corrodes and ulcerates the body wherever it is ap­ plied :
so that it is seldom used in­ ternally.
Externally it is dropped on warts and corns to remove them, and in the hollow of a decayed tooth to remove the pain by destroying the nerve."
Suidas describes τιθύμαλλος as εἰδος βοτάνης δρι­ μυτάτης, trapa Λάκωσιν εύρισκοένης.
And the Scholiast here says ἦν διαβόητος 6 Λακωνικὸς τιθύμαλλος.
These eye-plasters were rubbed on the eyelids, περιχρίομεν τὰ βλέφαρα, says Galen, De Rem. par. i. 5, and again in the treatise called ἰατρὸς, if that be really his.
But in the Plutus, 714-725, the god of healing, having made a plaster of σκόροδα, ὀπὀς, vinegar, and other acrid ingredients, instead of applying it to the outside of the eyelids of Neocleides, claps it on the inside to make them smart the more:
so that the hapless patient runs off howling with pain, and even blinder than before.
Throw in some spurge of the Laconian sort, And rub it on your eyelids every night.
That's what, had I been present, I'd have said.
CHR.
Next came Evaeon, smart accomplished chap, With nothing on, as most of us supposed, But he himself insisted he was clothed.
He made a popular democratic speech.
Behold, says he, I am myself in want
Of cash to save me ;
yet I know the way To save the citizens, and save the state.
Let every clothier give to all that ask Warm woollen robes, when first the sun turns back.
408. Εύαίων]
The second speaker is Evaeon the pauper;
πένης οὖτος, says the Scholiast:
and it is obvious from the whole tenor of his speech that he was a man in want of warm clothing, and sometimes in want of a warm bed.
His clothes on this occasion are so scanty or so threadbare, that people cannot perceive that he has any on.
For I take γυμνὸς to be used in its strict sense, as it plainly is in the passage which Dobree cites from Athenaeus,418.
τετραστατήρου]
He is in want of a half-guinea salvation:
referring prob­ ably not to a single coin, though golden τετραστάτηρα were coined at Cyrene (Pollux, ix. segm. 62) and apparently elsewhere:
but to four silver statera, which were current in several Hellenic states.
Their value is extremely un­ certain;
and four staters have been variously computed as worth from five to fifteen shillings.
Here they represent the price of a new suit of clothes, his need of which was manifest to all the Assembly from the deplorable state of his wardrobe.
This is the salvation which he requires, and he proceeds to show how he hopes to obtain it.
With the words δεόμενον σωτηρίας in the pre­ ceding line, Bergler compares Eur.
Heracleidae 11, where the old and feeble Iolaus, the only protector of the family of the dead Heracles, says, σώζω τάδ', αύτὸς δεύμενος σωτηρίας416.
ἤλιος τραπη̑]
Εὶς χειμεputty δηλοι­ óτι τροπήν.
—Scholiast.

The winter solstice is the commencement of the sun's northwardmovement, the summer solstice of its southward movement.
419.
άποενιμμέους]
The commenta­ tors have entirely missed the meaning of this word, translating it apprime lotos.
It means after they have dined, the term άπονίψασθαι, as we have seen in the Wasps, being specially applicable to the after-dinner wash.
See the note on Wasps 1216.426.
Ναυσικύδους]
We should know nothing certain about this Nausicydes, but for the passage which Bentley (and afterwards, but quite independently, Bergler).
has cited from Xenophon's Memorabilia, ii.
7, where Socrates ob­ .
serves that Nausicydes had amassed such a fortune from his dealings in grain, άπ' άλφιτοποιίας, that he became one of the wealthiest men in Athens, and bad frequently to undertake, at his own expense, some of those onerous public duties which were known as λειτουργίαι.
It was natural that a man who had acquired such great riches in such a trade should be accused, whether justly or unjustly, of having made his money by harsh and ungenerous deal­ ing:
and that is the innuendo in the line before us, In which case the poor would hate gaintd this benefit from Nausicydes.
The combination of ἳνα with a past tense of the indicative must not be overlooked, as implying that, except by means of this compulsory largest they would never gain any benefit from Nausicydes;
see supra 152, Wasps 961.
The construction is illus­ trated by Bp. Monk on Eur.
Hipp. 643 with his usual clearness and accuracy.
The example usually given of it is Oed.
Tyr. 1386, where Oedipus says that had it been possible, he would have destroyed not merely his eyesight, but the fount ofNo more will pleurisy attack us then.

εύπρεπὴς νεανίας]
Praxagora her­ self is the third speaker, " a fair and pleasant-looking youth," says Chremes, little dreaming that he is describing the wife of Blepyrus.
She rises from the strange and pallid crowd of whom he has spoken before.
Both the epithets λευκὸς and εύπρεπὴς are applied to the effeminate Agathon in Thesm.
191,192.428. άνεπήδησε]
Observe the different manner in which the three orators as­ cended the bema.
Neocleides in his dim purblind way παρείπυσεcame crawl­ ing on.
Evaeon simply παρη̑λθε, the ordinary word for an orator coming forward to speak.
See Thucydides, i. 67, 72, 79, 85, and-passim.
Praxagora, in the nervous excitement natural to her position, άνεπήεησε, sprang up to it.
The Nicias to whom she is compared is probably, as Paulmier suggested, the grandson of the famous Nicias who fell in Sicily.
It is true that in his speech "
In the matter of the confiscation of the goods of [Eucrates], the brother of Nicias," Lysias speaks of the grandson in a manner which shows that he must still have been a mere lad at the date of this play:
but the present passage does not, I think, imply that the Nicias to whom it alludes had ever taken part in the proceedings of the Assembly, whilst it does certainly imply that his good looks and graceful manners were generally familiar to the audience.
One can imagine the agreeable surprise it would be to the lad to be thus singled out for a public compliment in the crowded theatre.430.

CHR.
And women lend each other, said the lad,with a general charge of this kind, which each individual would clearly see exactly applied to his neighbours, and had not the slightest application to himself.
Blepyrus too clinches the charge by saying τίς ἄλλωςλέγει;
who denies that?
For the Scholiast is in error in explaining ἄλλως by ματαίως.
ἄλλως is used here as in Frogs 1140, οίκ ἄλλως λέγω, I say not otherwise.
The term " sycophant " in the translation of the previous line is, of course, to be taken in its ancient signification.

From the (festi­ val of the) twain goddesses, Demeter and Persephone, in their character of the bestowers of social rites and customs.
Unfortunately it is too true that these secrets were never betrayed (cf. Thesm. 472), and are consequently entirely un­ known.450.
TOÛTO δρα̑]
To άποστερει̑ν.
—Scholi­ ast. άποστερει̑ν is used here in its strictly proper sense of withholding money or valuables which you have borrowed or which have been entrusted to your care.
See Clouds 1305, 1464, and the Trape­ ziticus of lacerates, passim.
In Plutus 373 it is distinguished from κλέπτειν and άρπάζειν, terms which imply an un­ lawful taking in the first instance, whereas here the wrong consisted in the refusal to restore what in the first instance had been lawfully taken.453.

We must probably here, as Dr. Blaydes suggests, supply the infinitive δρα̑ν from line 450.455.

In say­ ing έπιτρέπεινΣΕ, Chremes is merely constituting Blepyrus the represen­ tative of the citizens generally, just as he did when (supra 435-439) he saidTheir dresses, trinkets, money, drinking-cups, Though quite alone, with never a witness there.
And all restore the loan, and none withhold it.
But men, he said, are always doing this.
BLEP.
Aye to be sure:
though witnesses were there.
CHR.
They don't inform, or prosecute, or put The people down:
but everything that's right.
And much, besides, he praised the womankind.
BLEP.

You're to put the state Into their hands.
This was the one reform
Not yet attempted.

Scholiast.
For it it clearly to this speech of Chremes, and not to the next, that this scholium belongs.473.
λόγος it. τ. X.]
Perhaps
I may be allowed to repeat here a note of my own, published many years ago, on another passage of Aristophanes:
"When the contention between Poseidon and Athenè for the patronage of Athens was decided in favour of the latter, Poseidon in anger imprecated per­ petual δυσβουλία on the new city.
Now the decrees of deities were, like those of the Medes and Persians, supposed to be irreversible, even by themselves:
, what one god had done, no other, nor even himself, could undo;
but he could virtually nullify the effect by a subse­ quent decree.
To use the language of the Roman law, the remedy was obrogatio, not abrogatio.
Hera deprived Teiresias of sight;
Zeus could not restore it, but he gave him the power of prophecy.
Neither could Apollo revoke the gift of prophecy which he had bestowed upon Cassandra, but he could nullify it by making all men disbelieve her.
And so in the instance before us, Athenè could not change the curse of perpetual δυσ­ βουλία, but she could and did nullify its effect by causing it always to have a successful issue."
ϋέγεται, says the Scholiast here, ο̄τε Ποσειδω̑ν κα ὶ 'ΑθηνᾱBLEP.
They'll dock our breakfasts.

If that is for The public good, we needs must all obey.
There is a legend of the olden time, That all our foolish plans and vain conceits Are overruled to work the public good.

But I must go.

BLEP.

And this is why Chremes, in his prayer three lines below, whilst invoking generally all the gods, makes a special appeal to Pallas.477.
ίγίαινε]
Lucian composed a treatise, Pro lapsu inter salutandum, because he had given a friend the even­ ing salutation ύγίαινε, instead of the morning χαι̑ρε.
But it is clear that no such distinction existed in the time of Aristophanes.
And cf. Frogs 165.
With these words Chremes and Blepyrus re- enter their respective houses, and after a short pause, the Chorus are heard, returning from the Assembly.

The words in the preced­ ing line, πολλοὶ yap οἶ πανου̑ργι, are doubtless another delicate compliment, conveyed by glance or gesture, to the audience.483. έπικτυπω̑ν] ψόον ποιω̑ν.—Scho­ liast.

Looking askance with one eye ;
looking out of the corner of your eye, as our expression goes.
The women, whilst engaged in changing their dresses, are yet to cast a sidelong glance out of one of their eyes, to see that no man approaches.
The same phrase occurs in Wasps 497.500.
τὴν στρατηγόν] Praxagora is seen returning from the Assembly.
She is still wearing her husband's garments, and enters the stage alone.
We hear no more of the two women who had been her companions there before.
And nobody else comes on the stage until Blepyrus and Chremes emerge fromSo wrap your garments round you tight, And peep about with all your might, Both here and there and on your right,Or this our plot to save the state will in disaster terminate.
MOVE ON, dear friends, move on apace, for now we're very near the placeFrom whence we started, when we went to join the men in Parliament.
And there's the mansion, full in view, where dwells our lady chieftain, whoThe wise and noble scheme invented to which the state has just assented.
So NOW no longer must we stay, no longer while the time away, False-bearded with this bristly hair,Lest some one see us and declare our hidden secret everywhere.
So draw ye closer, at my call, Beneath the shadow of the wall, And glancing sideways, one and all,Adjust and change your dresses there, and bear the form which erst ye bare.
FOR SEE the noble lady fair, our chieftainess, approaching there.
She's coming home with eager speed from yon Assembly;
take ye heed,And loathe upon your chins to wear that monstrous equipage of hair ;
For 'neath its tickling mass, I know, they've all been smarting long ago.
their respective houses, twenty lines below.
The Chorus fulfil the promise made supra 246.503.
ἀλγου̑σιν]
The MSS.
and editions read ἥκουσιν, which is translated, and taken by all commentators to mean, praeserlim quum illae (the women who enter with Praxagora) adveniant vestem solitam jam pridem indutae.
But the Greek is not open to such an interpreta­ tion, even if it were not perfectly plain that Praxagora enters alone.
In my judgement the entire line is a mere gloss which has pushed out, and stepped into the place of, the original line;
its meaning being, that the women had, in the first, instance, come on the stage prepared with manly beards and manly dresses;
see 482 supra.
Nevertheless, as the original line is lost beyond hope of recovery, I have thought it best to adopt the ingenious suggestion made by Professor Arthur Palmer in the Quarterly Review of October, 1884, who alters ἥκουσιν into ἀλγου̑σιν, and refers the preceding χαὖται to "the tender cheeks of the delicate ladies, which are tired of wearing the rough beards so long."
Praxagora now from the stage addresses the Chorus in the orchestra.507.
ἐμβὰς ἐκποδών]
No doubt a play is intended between ἐκποδὼν and ἐκ ποδω̑ν.
Here, again, ἐμβὰς is employed to denote the Λακωνική.
See the note on 345 supra.508.
συναπτοὺς ἡνἰας]
The Scholiast's interpretation τὰς συναπτούσας καὶ it­ σμευούσας τὰ ὑποδήματα shows that he rightly understood the meaning of ἡνἱας, but συναπτοὺς signifies "fastened," not " fastening."
I take the whole line to .
be a quotation from Euripides or some other tragic poet, which in the original was a direction to some charioteer to let loose the Spartan reins, and give the horse its head, but is here diverted into a pompous description of the shoe­ latchets with which the " red Laco­ nians" were tied.
And this accounts for the use of the singular χάλα, which is otherwise difficult to explain.509. σύ]
Praxagora checks herself in the midst of her directions to the Chorus, and requests the coryphaeus to undertake the arrangements in her stead.
513.
ἁξηνεγκάμην]
Praxagora retires into her house (the house of Blepyrus) to change her dress, whilst the Chorus change theirs in the orchestra.
She almost immediately returns, and hence­ forth all the women are clothed in their proper habiliments.
And now the great work has been accomplished, and thePRAX.

Discard your staves;

What's thatscene closes with an exchange of well­ deserved compliments between Praxa­ gora and her followers.518. ἐκει̑] ’Εν τη̨̑ ἐκκλησία.
—Scholiast.
They had not been daunted by the opposition of the men (supra 432);
nor had they, in that unaccustomed scene, lost their presence of mind, and, as in the rehearsal (supra 132-191), betrayed their sex by womanly language.
On the epithet ἀνδρειόταται as applied to women, see the note on Wasps 1090.520. αὔτη]
She has hardly finished her anapaests when Blepyrus and Chremes emerge from their respective houses, and find her standing alone in the street.
The αὕτη with which Ble­ pyrus hails her, means (like the more common οὖτος addressed to a man), you there!
heus tu!
A bright and saucy dialogue ensues between husband and wife, leading up to the great debate of the play.
That the friend who occa­ sionally intervenes is the mild and tolerant Chremes, I am quite convinced, though he takes so little part in the conversation, that the very presence of a third person is ignored by some.
It is, however, conclusively proved by lines 569, 570 infra, and by the use of thedual σΦω̨̑ν in line 710, as well as by various remarks which cannot with propriety be assigned to either of the disputants.
As a rule be addresses himself to Blepyrus, and speaks of Praxagora in the third person.
In the following line ὡς εὐηθικω̑ς means what a remarkably silly question !522.
παρὰ του̑ μοιχου̑]
The definite article has given some trouble, as seem­ ing to imply that Praxagora possessed a lover.
But even if this were the true .
interpretation it need not cause any surprise, since in these opening lines Praxagora is playfully making sugges­ tions against herself, which, her hus­ band is well aware, have no foundation in fact.
But in reality there is no such implication;
she is merely putting words into her husband's lips:
" You will not say to me, as some husbands might justly say to their wives, you are coming from your lover.
"526. οὐ Si τάλαιν’ ἔγωγε]
Τάλαινα is an expression of self commiseration, 0 that I should be suspected of such a thing.
To you, my man?
BLEP.
What's that to me?
That's cool.
PRAX.
Not from a lover;

BLEP.
Does not a woman sin unless she's perfumed ?
PRAX.

BLEP.
What made you steal
Away so early with my overcloke ?
PRAX.
I was called out ere daybreak, to a friend
In pangs of childbirth.
BLEP.
Why not tell me first, Before you went?
PRAX.

BLEP.
After telling me.

BLEP.
Is that the reason why You did not put your mantle on ?
You threw it Over my bed and took my overcloke, And left me lying like a corpse laid out;
less here it is the latter, and so Bergler and the commentators generally take it.532.
μὰ τὼ θεώ]
Praxagora, with her womanly garments, has resumed the womanly oath which she so vigorously tabooed before (155-158 supra).
ω̃απερ εἰχον, just as I was, without delaying to complete her toilet, or awaken her husband.536. του̃γκυκλον]
Τὸ γυναικει̑ον ἱμάτον. — Scholiast.
The ἔγκυκλον was, as the Scholiast explains, a woman's outer mantle or shawl, corresponding to the man's ἱμάτον, just as her κροκωτὸς cor­ responded to his χιτών.
See the note on 333 supra, and Thesm.
254, 261. ἐμ’ ἀποδύσασα means merely having taken away my clothes.
Apparently, the night being cold, Blepyrus had cast his ἱμάτιον over the bed:
his wife takes it off and leaves her ἔγκυκλον in its place.
537.
ὡσπερεὶ προκείμενον]
Like a corpse laid outfor its burial.
This laying out, or streeking, πρόθεσις, usually took place on the day preceding the day of the burial.
The body was placed on a bier or bed, clothed in white, crowned with wreaths, and with its feet towards the door.
Beside it were placed several of thosesmall vases or bottles of oil, λήκυθοι (of which numerous specimens may be seen in the British Museum), which were in such constant request during an Athenian's life-in his house, at the bath, in the gymnasium, and even on the battlefield;
and which were finally buried with him in his grave.
These funeral λήκυθοι are again mentioned infra 996, 1032, 1101, 1111.
And see generally the treatise of Lucian De Luctu, a satire on the popular funeral ceremonies of the time..

μεθυπεδησάμην]
I changed my shoes for yours, ι̃να σε μιμησαμένη σώσαιμι τὸ ἱμάτιον. — Scholiast.
Save them, she means, from the λωποδυτω̃ν, who were always on the look out at night-time to relieve a solitary wayfarer of his overcloke.
See the note on 668 infra.547.
πυρω̑ν ἑκτέα]
An ἑκτεὺς was the sixth part of a medimnus.
And as Blepyrus means that the triobol which he would have earned by attending the Assembly, would have purchased an ἑκτεὺς of wheat, it follows that a medimnus of wheat would cost about 18 obols, or 3 drachmas.
And Boeckh (Public Economy of Athens, i. 15), comparing the various data which bear on the subject, comes to the conclusion that this would in fact have been the price of a medimnus of wheat at the time of this play.
Blepyrus has sum­ cient presence of mind to conceal from his wife that there were other stringentOnly I'd never a wreath, or bottle of oil.
PRAX.
The night was cold, and I'm so slight and fragile, I took your overcloke to keep me warm.

We must assume it to hare been not one of the ordinary Assemblies, but one con­ voked for the special purpose of con­ sidering what steps should be taken for the safety of the state, supra 396.554.
κάθησο κ.τ.λ.]
The cuttle seems to have been a favourite article of diet with Athenian women:
and although now, I believe, altogether banished from English tables, it was not always so.
"The cuttle,”says Lord Bacon, .. is a delicate meat, and is much in request.”—Nat.Hist. 742. The Scholiast's explanation, οἶον ἐντρυΦω̑σα διὰ τὴν ἐξουσίαν, is followed by all the commen­ tators, who adopt Le Fevre's translation, "sede, et in posterum laute ac beate vivito;
tibi enim magnum imperium paratum video."
But this interpretation would require γὰρ, not δὲ, in the follow­ ing line, and is, in my judgement, altogether erroneous.
Praxagora has re­ presented herself as completely wrapped up in domestic affairs, and ignorant of all that has passed in the public Assembly.
Blepyrus is glorying in his superior knowledge.
Sit you down, he says, scornfully, and che cuttlefish with your gossips.
You do not know, as I do, what great events have occurred to-day.
Then he tells her.
561.
μαρτυρει̑ν]
Not necessarily false witness.
She is speaking of those common informers, the bane of Athens, who got their living by spying out unintentional or immaterial infractions of the law, and harassing the unfortunate offender by giving and procuring evi­ dence against him in the courts of justice.
They are described in Wasps 1040, 1041 as mischief-makers who ἐπὶ τοίσιν άπράγοσιν ύμŵν άντωμοσίας καί προσκλήσεις καὶ ΜΑΡΤΥΡΙΑΣ συνεκόλλων.562.
μηδαμω̑ς τουτὶ ποιήσῃ]
He speaks as if Praxagora had been saying that she would forbid men to do so and so, . whereas she had merely enunciated a categorical proposition, it will not be open to them to do so.
Praxagora dis­ dains to notice his interruption, and yet it affects her own language, making her substitute the dependent negative μὴ for the absolute negative οὐ. " Pergit Praxagora," says Dr. Blaydes, " quasi praecesserit non οὐ yap ἔτι ἔσται Bed ἤδη ἀπαγορευθήσεται.”568.
μηδ’ ἀΦέλῃ μου τὸν βίον] " Vivit scilicet malis istis artibus bonus vir Blepyrus.

The words seem to be borrowed from the line of Sophocles which Bergler quotes, where Pbiloctetes, praying that he may not be deprived of the unerring bow of Heracles, exclaims πρὸς θεω̑ν πατρῴων, τὸν βίον μή pov ’Φέλῃς (Phil. 933 a somewhat careless expression, for βίον would probably have been changed into βιὸν (a bow), if indeed the poet had not guarded against this mistake by writing, two lines earlier, ἀπεστέρηκας τὸν Pi'or τὰ τόξ’ ἑλών.

two words βίος and βιὸς in Plutus 34.567.
ἐνεχυραζόμενον Φέρειν]
Although the general meaning is clear, viz. that there will be an end of executions and distraints, yet the exact meaning of each word is not equally clear.
Pro­ bably however ἐνεχυραζόμενον is the neuter, and equivalent to the substan­ tive ἐνέχ
υ
ρον, in which case the significa­ tion would be to seize goods given as security;
goods over which (an English lawyer might say) the debtor had given a bill of sale.
So in Antiphon's speech
In the matter of a choreutes (11) the defendant choregus says TOP χορὸν συνέ­ )"ia i>t 1ðvJ,áp."J' 11p&tTTa, oBrt CFJfUtÍ.
KTar οὐδένα, οὔτε ἐνέχυρα βίᾳ Φέρων κ.τ.λ.
And so it is taken by Brunck, who translates it non pignora a debitoribus auferre.
It is possible, however, that ἐνεχυραζόμενον is the masculine, in which case Φέρειν would mean to harry (ἔΦερον ἀλλήλους, Thuc. i. 7) the debtor who had given the bill of sale, ferre et raptare hominem a quo pignora capiuntur, as Le Fevre translates it.
The two interpretations come to exactly the same thing.
The process seems to have been familiar to Chremes, who expresses himself with enthusiasm on finding that Praxagora means to do away with this extremely disagreeable proceeding.
Cf. infra 755 ;
Clouds 35, 241;
Plutus 451.571. νυ̑ν δὴ δεί]
The time for expound­ ing the principles of the γυναικοκρατία has arrived:
and the Chorus greet their chieftainess with a little song of advice and encouragement;
the strophe, pro­ bably, to an antistrophe which has dropped out after line 729 infra.
It consists of eighteen lines, all but four of which are composed of a choriamb and an Ionic a minore.
The Ionic is twice shorn of its final syllable, and so .
becomes an anapaest, and once of its first syllable, and so becomes a bacchic foot.
Also the first line has a dissyllabic, and the fourth a monosyllabic, base.
And of course in all non-continuous metres the final syllable may be either long or short:
παντὸς μέτρου ἀδιάφορός έστιν ή τελευταία συλλβή, ŵστε δύνασθαιί είναι αύτήν καί βραχείαν καί μακράν — Hephaestion, iv.
2. Of the four remain­ ing lines, the fifth, eighth, and eleventh are trochaic dipodies;
whilst the final line has an additional trochaic foot, and is therefore a trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic.
The metrical scheme of the chorus is set out in the Appendix.
The first line appears in the MSS.
as νûν δή δεί σε πυκνήν фρένα καί фιλόσοфον ἐγείρειν, but I have struck out the words φρέα καὶ φιλόσ
οφον, which are useless to the sense, and destructive to the metre, and have plainly crept into the text from some gloss on the wordsCHOR.

There is doubtless here a covert reflection upon the poet's rivals, with whose constant harping on the self-same topics he is fond of contrasting his own boundless variety and originality.
"
Unlike them." he says in the Clouds, " I am ἀεὶ καινάς ίδέας είσфέρων, ούδέν άλλήλαισινι όμοίας καί πάσας δεξιάς.
”-Clouds 547, 548. "
You should love and cherish a poet," he says in the Wasps, " who is ever seeking καινόν τι λέγειν κἀξευρίσκειν.” — Wasps 1053.
And compare the opening scene of the Frogs.
He was probably unjust to his rivals, but that his own self-praise was justified, the existing comedies abundantly testify.
If the entire sen­ tence from μισου̑σι to θεῶνται were read as one line, as it is by Brunck and the older editors, it would be in the same metre as the concluding lines of the Wasps.
See the note on Wasps 1518.581. α̃πτεσθαι]
To begin the fray, τβῖς διανοίας, with your novel thoughts and arguments.
These are the weapons with which the is to fight.
Compare Clouds 943, With the expression χαρίτων μετέχει πλεῖστον in the following line, Brunck compares Frogs 334, χαρίτων πλεῖστον ε̃χουσαν μέρος.583.
τοὺς δὲ θεατάς]
She is confident in the merits of her case, but fears that the audience may not approve of so novel a scheme, τοὺς θεατὰς is the ac­ cusative placed before the conjunction, instead of the nominative placed after it.
So Birds 652, 653, 1269, 1270 and passim.
And compare such passages as that in Romeo and Juliet, iv.
2, Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, All our.
whole city is much bound to him.
Throughout the ensuing discussion, the long Aristophanics of the text are in the translation unworthily represented by anapaestic dimeters, in which many lines are omitted, and a few added, and which generally aim at giving rather the spirit of the argument than a literal rendering of the words.
At the time they were written it was supposed that in this play, as in the Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae, it would be necessary to leave such large blanks in the translation as would unfit it for appearing in juxtaposition with the Greek, and consequently various liber­ ties were taken, for which it is hoped that these considerations may be ac­ cepted as an adequate apology.584.
καινοτομεῖν]
It must have been sufficiently diverting to an Athenian audience to hear themselves described as too fond of standing in the old ways, and impatient of everything novel and untried.
For of course, as Blepyrus immediately reminds his wife, their dis­ tinguishing characteristic throughout all their history was their inexhaustible love of novelty and change.
This indeed was their very reason for adopting Praxagora's revolutionary scheme,So come to the point, and at once:
for delay Is a thing the spectators detest in a play.
PRAX.
I've an excellent scheme, if you will but believe it;
But I cannot be sure how our friends will receive it;
Or what they will do, if the old I eschew, And propound them a system erratic and new.
This makes me a trifle alarmed and faint-hearted.
BLEP.
As to that, you may safely be fearless and bold :
We adore what is new, and abhor what is old.
This rule we retain when all else has departed.
PRAX.
Then all to the speaker in silence attend,In Thucydides, iii. 38, Cleon, struggling to maintain the decree for the massacre of the Mitylenaeans, says that the Athenians were δου̑λοι τῶν ἀεὶ ἀτόπων, ὑπερόπται δὲ τῶν εἰωθότων.
And the same character is constantly given of them by Isocrates, Demosthenes, and the other political orators.587.
ἀντ’ ἄλλης ἀρχη̑ς] ’Αντὶ του̑ ἄρχειν TO καινοτομεῖν, as the Scholiast rightly explains it.
The speaker is playing on the words ἀρχη̑ς and ἀρχαίων.
They have lost their fair empire, the καλὴν ἀρχὴν of which Aristophanes speaks in the Knights (ὠ Δη̑με, καλήν γ’ ε̃χεις ἀρχὴν), and now their only substitute is καινοτο­ μεῖν and to keep clear of τῶν ἀρχαἰων, and whatever is in any way connected with ἀρχή.588.
μήνυν κ.τ.λ.]
Praxagora.
hitherto a mere innocent-inquirer, proceeds to develop her scheme with the air and authority of a lawgiver.
Yet she has not told her husband that she had been the leader of the movement, or the speaker in the Assembly, or that she is the elected chieftainess of the New Republic.
Aristophanes seems to have thought this unnecessary ;
the audience knew it, and that was enough for his purpose.
It is not until the discussion has closed that she mentions, and then only incidentally (infra 714), that she is now the ruler of the state.
At the outset she stipulates that nobody shall gainsay or interrupt her, so that her entire plan may be presented to her audience before the heckling begins.
ὑποκρούειν is the regular word for inter- !
rupting a speaker.
Cf. supra 256, infra 596, Ach. 38. So in Lucian's Toxaris, the Hellenic speaker, having been al­ lowed to finish his own speech without interruption, begins at once to interpose in the Scythian's reply.
And the latter says, όρα̜ς, τοῖτο ω̒ς ἐριστικὸν ποιεῖς καὶ589.
του̑ φράζοντος]
She uses the mas­ culine because, as Bergler observes, she is enunciating a general maxim, Oratori auscultandum.
She means, of course, " Listen to me,” but she puts it in the form of a general rule, " Listen to the speaker.
"590. Κοινωνεῖν]
The first word of Praxagora's address strikes the keynote of the scheme she is about to propose, a scheme which aims at making a clean sweep of the existing order of things, social as well as political, and setting up in its place a system of pure un­ adulterated communism, under the con­ trol of the women.
This is the more surprising, because the special qualifica­ tion put forward by the women in their bid for power is the intense innate con­ servatism of their sex (supra 215-238), . as contrasted with the incessant craving for novelty and change exhibited by the men.
But the theories of Plato, which we now find embodied in the Fifth Book of his Republic, were begin­ ning to attract very general attention;
and Aristophanes, having gone so far on one tack, suddenly finds before him a unique opportunity for bringing those theories into ridicule and caricature;
and, unable to resist the temptation, he throws to the winds the consistency of his plot.
Some remarks on this subject will be found in the Introduction to the play.592.
μηδὲ ταφη̑ναι]
These words occur again in Plutus 556, where Poverty says that a poor man's lot is “ for ever to toil and to slave At Poverty's call:
and to leave after all not even enough for a grave,” καταλείψει, μηδὲ ταφη̑ναι.
There, however, the reference is to the cost of the funeral;
here, to the ground required for the interment.
And don't interrupt till I come to the end, And weigh and perpend, till you quite comprehend, The drift and intent of the scheme I present.
The rule which I dare to enact and declare, Is that all shall be equal, and equally share All wealth and enjoyments, nor longer endure
That one should be rich, and another be poor, That one should have acres, far-stretching and wide, And another not even enough to provide Himself with a grave:
that this at his call Should have hundreds of servants, and that none at all.
All this I intend to correct and amend :
Now all of all blessings shall freely partake, One life and one system for all men I make.
BLEP.
And how will you manage it ?
PRAX.
First, I'll provide
That the silver, and land, and whatever besideDiogeiton, 23, where Diogeiton is said to have turned his grandchildren out of their own house ἀνυποδήτους, οὐ μετὰ ὰκολούθου, οὐ μετὰ στρωάτων,
Of μετὰ ἱματίων.
The name was perpetuated both in the Greek empire and in the church, one of the highest dignitaries in the former, and one of the lowest ministers in the other, being designated an acolythe or acolyte.595.
κατέδει σπέλεθον]
Praxagora has stipulated that she shall be allowed to unfold her plan without any interrup­ tion, but hardly has she got through five lines, when her husband strikes in with a quite unnecessary question.
This so exasperates the lady that she hurls at his head a slang expression of abuse, You shall eat muck before I do.
Blepyrus affects to suppose this to be part of her scheme, and innocently inquires whether her communistic system extends to the muck, so that she will share it with him.
No, she says, but you were too quick with your interruption;
you forestalled me by breaking in upon my speech, ε̃φθης μ’ ύποκρούσας.
You inter­ rupted me by asking a question which my next words would hare answered.
After this little ebullition, though Blepyrus continues to interrupt, they get on amicably enough.
As to σπέλεθον, see Acharnians 1170.
These two lines are omitted in the translation, which pro­ ceeds as if the Greek ran, BA.
πῶς οὖν έσται κοιός άπασικ.
ΠΡ. τήν γήν πρώτιστα ποιήσω.597.
τὴν γη̑ν κ.τλ.]
This abolition of private property is very prominently put forward by Plato, though of course in his Republic it applies not to thecitizens generally, but only to one par­ ticular class, the φύλακες, or warders of the state. "
Must they not live in some such fashion as this ?

And in the twelfth chapter of the fifth book (464 B) he refers back to this statement,601.
ἀργύριον καὶ Δαρεικούς]
The silver of Laureium, and the gold of Persia.
The Darics are the famous gold coins of the Persian empire, which from the comparison made by Greek writers between their value and that of their own coinage would be deemed worth about 16s.
3d. each, but which, from the specimens still extant in the British Museum and elsewhere, appear to have been really worth about 21s.
10d. of our money.
See Hussey's Ancient Weights and Money, vii.
3. We know that Darius, the son of Hystaspes, puri­ tied the gold coinage of Persia (Hdt. iv. 166), but it is certain that the Dane was in use long before his time.
εἰσὶ ἑτέρου τινός παλαιοτέρου βασιλέως.
—Har­ pocration and Suidas s. v. and the Aldine Scholiast here.
Indeed, the great pro­ fusion in which they were everywhere found at the time of the Persian wars seems to show that they must have been in existence for a very considerable time.
When Xerxes was marching to the invasion of Hellas, a Lydian named Pythius entertained the king and his whole army, and afterwards offered all his wealth (other than his land and the slaves who tilled it) to fill the coffers of the king.
That wealth consisted of a vast amount of silver, and four million (all but 7,000) Darics of gold.
Xerxes, instead of taking the money, added the 7,000 Darics required to complete the four millions (Hdt. vii 27-80).
On a smaller scale is the anecdote of the Asiatic who endeavoured to bribe the Athenian Cimon by giving him two goblets, one filled with Darics of silver and the other with Darics of gold;
forEach man shall possess, shall be common and free, One fund for the public;
then out of it we Will feed and maintain you, like housekeepers true, Dispensing, and sparing, and caring for you.
BLEP.
With regard to the land, I can quite understand, But how, if a man have his money in hand, Not farms, which you see, and he cannot withhold, But talents of silver and Darics of gold?
PRAM.
All this to the stores he must bring.
BLEP.
But suppose
He choose to retain it, and nobody knows ;
Rank perjury doubtless;
but what if it be?
'Twas by that he acquired it at first.
PRAX.
I agree.
But now 'twill be useless;
he'll need it no more.
BLEP.
How mean you ?
PRAX.
All pressure from want will be o'er.
Now each will have all that a man can desire,there were silver Danes too, though the name, when standing alone, signifies as a rule the golden coin.
—Plutarch, Cimon, x. See also Aelian, V. H. i. 22;
Lysias against Eratosthenes, 12. Peri­ zonius (on Aelian ubi supra) supposes that the older King Darius to whom Harpocration refers was the " Darius the Mede " mentioned by the Prophet Daniel;
and this is likely enough, whatever may have been the real origin of the name " Daric."602. ἀφανη̑ πλου̑τον]
This is a legal term, signifying movable properly, as contrasted with lands and houses, which are always in situ, can easily be identi­ fied, and cannot be concealed or car­ ried away.
ἀΦανὴς οὐσία καὶ φανερά. ἀφανὴς μὲν ἡ ἐν χρήμασι καὶ σώμοσι καὶ σκεύει, φανερὰ δὲ η̒ε̃γγειος—Harpocration.
The reason of the names is excellently illustrated by the present passage.603.
κάν, μὴ καταθεὶς, ψευδορκήση;
]
So I think we should read these words, in lieu of the ordinary καὶ μὴ καταθεὶς ψευ­ δορκήσει, which is usually continued to Praxagora, and does not afford an al­ together satisfactory meaning.
But with the slight alterations made above in the text, all difficulty appears to be removed.
How if he does not deposit them at the stores, but perjures himself by sicearing that he has brought in all his substance ?
(He is likely enough to retain them by perjury) for it was by perjury that he got them.
διὰ του̑το means, as the Scholiast says, διa τό ἐπιορκείν, or more strictly, διὰ TO ψευδ­ ορκεȋν.611.
σκαλαθυ̑ραι] Συνουσιαι.—Scho­ liast.
Hitherto we have been dealing with the subject of the community of goods;
but with this suggestion of Blepyrus we pass over to another branch of the Platonic scheme, that which is called in the Republic ἡ τῶν γυναικῶν re xal παίδων κοινωνία τοῖς φύλαξιν.
See the note three lines below.
To this branch forty lines are devoted ;
and we then return to the question of the com­ munity of goods.
The subject now broached, however, reappears in Praxa­ gora's peroration, infra 693-709;
and again in the scene of the three hags, infra 877-1111.612.
τούτων]
That is, of his own private property, which he has not brought into the public stores.
But the commen­ tators have strangely misconceived the meaning of the latter part of the line.
Dr. Blaydes renders it" Postquam autem cum ilia dormirerit, communium partici­ pabit;
et tantum inde argenti sumet quantum puellae donavcrit."
And he adds “Assumtum Blepyri hoc est:
Si quis puellam formosam viderit, pecunia ei numerata vel praesenti (ut dicitur) opus futurum, quam puellae extemplo do net, tantundem mox ex acervo recupera­ turus.”
But this is not the meaning of the passage.
The words τῶν ἐκ κοινου̑ are a mere piece of flippancy on the part of Blepyrus, meaning "the plea­ sures they will share together," or in other words " the pleasures of love.
"614. κοινάς]
This is, in truth, the very language of Plato in the fifth book ofCakes, barley-loaves, chestnuts, abundant attire, Wine, garlands and fish :
then why should he wish The wealth he has gotten by fraud to retain ?
If you know any reason, I hope you'll explain.
BLEP.
'Tis those that have most of these goods, I believe, That are always the worst and the keenest to thieve.
PRAX.
I grant you, my friend, in the days that are past, In your old-fashioned system, abolished at last;
But what he's to gain, though his wealth he retain, When all things are common, I'd have you explain.
BLEP.
If a youth to a girl his devotion would show, He surely must woo her with presents.
PRAX. 0 no.
All women and men will be common and free, No marriage or other restraint there will be.
BLEP.
But if all should aspire to the favours of one, To the girl that is fairest, what then will be done?
PRAX.
By the side of the beauty, so stately and grand, The dwarf, the deformed, and the ugly will stand;
And before you’re entitled the beauty to woo,the Republic, though here again the rule is of course applicable to the warders of the state and to none others.
There will be a law, he says, τὰς γυναῖκας chap.
vii. 457 C.
And a few lines lower he adds,
As a question of utility, I think that nobody will doubt ώς οὺ μέγιστον ἀγαθὸνκοινὰς μὲν τὰς γυνυῖκαςεἶναι, κοινοὺς δὲ τοὺς παἱδας.
And again, in chap. xii.617. a!
φαυλότεραι ] A! ἄμορφοι.__ Scho­ liast.
As to σιμότεραι it is to be ob­ served that σιμότης, whether in man or in woman, is throughout accounted one of the greatest possible blemishes.
On σεμνὰς Kuster observes—“ Proprie super­ has velfastum prat se ferentes.
At per metonymiam consequentis pro ante­ cedenti, formosas, pulchras.
Puellae enim formosae fastu carere non solent.”
But I doubt if that excellent commen­ tator, when he penned the foregoing criticism, was not himself suffering from the airs of some formosa puella.
σεμνὸς is an epithet of the gods, and thence comes to be applied to menand women, who in beauty, stateliness, and nobility of mind and manners seem to come nearest the gods.620.
ἐκεῖσ’οἶ φῄς ]
Πρὸς τὰς εὐμόρφους, says the Scholiast, rightly as regards the meaning, though as Blepyrus is referring to the language employed by Praxagora, the Scholiast ought perhaps to have written πρὸςτὰς σεμνάς.
He is speaking of the old men here, but the young man asks the same question, infra 1080.621.
οὐχὶ μαχου̑νταιπερὶ σου̑]
Blepyrus is apprehensive lest a certain disaster should befall him :
on which Praxagora says, Of You need not be alarmed:
you will not be in such request as you anticipate.
They won't fight about you."
Blepyrus does not quite catch her meaning.
“ Won't fight!" he re­ torts, "what for?"
Of For the honour of being your bedfellow," she replies.
"No such disaster as you fear will befall you." ύπάρξειιs used here ex­ actly as in Soph.

το μὲν ύμέτερον]
Your part (that is, the provision made for the ladies) γνώμην τιν’ ἔχειhas some sensein it.
TO μὲν ύμέτερον is equivalent to TO τῶν γυναικῶν, and therefore Blepyrus, speak­ ing of the men's part, says TO δὲ τῶν ἀνδρῶν instead of τὸ δὲ ἡμέτερ
ον.
With the expression γνώμην τιν’ ἔχει compare γνώμην ἔχον, Wasps 64.624.
τρύπημα κενόν]
Τρύπημα seems properly to have signified an oar hole:
Your court you must pay to the hag and the shrew.
BLEP.
For the ladies you've nicely provided no doubt;
No woman will now be a lover without.
But what of the men ?
For the girls, I suspect, The handsome will choose, and the ugly reject.
PRAX.
No girl will of course be permitted to mate Except in accord with the rules of the state.
By the side of her lover, so handsome and tall, Will be stationed the squat, the ungainly and small.
And before she's entitled the beau to obtain, Her love she must grant to the awkward and plain.
BLEP.
O then such a nose as Lysicrates shows Will vie with the fairest and best, I suppose.
see Peace 1234;
and there probably is here, as there certainly is there, an allusion to the fraudulent tricks of trierarchs, who sometimes did not pro­ vide the full complement of rowers, so that some τρυπήματα were κενά.626.
ἀλλἀ φυλάξουσ’ κ.τ.λ.]
The φαυλό­ τεροι,the ugly, stunted, clownish, and other unacceptable wooers will keep an eye on the dandies, as they emerge from the banquet (infra 694) flushed with love and wine (infra 948,', and when they go to pay court to their lady loves will claim the precedence, which, says Praxagora, the Jaw awards them.
The translation of this little speech seems to hare quite lost touch with the original.627.
ἐπὶ τοῖσινδημοσίοισιν] Τόποις.- Scholiast.
In the public places, such as the δίοδοι mentioned 693 infra. 628. ol φαυλίτεροι]
The repetition of these two words can hardly be right.
And baring regard to the contrasted epithets in lines 701, 705 infra, I.think that, combining the suggestions of various critics, we might read lines 628, 629 as follows:
-
But this is too uncertain to justify an alteration of the text, and I have therefore, with some of my predecessors, been content to enclose the words in brackets.

ἡΛυσικράτους ρ̒ίς] Σιμὸς καὶ αὶσχρὸς ό Λυσικράτης.—Scholiast.
And yet he was apparently what we call .. a ladies' man," and endeavoured, by dyeing his hair, to make himself look younger.
See 736 infra.
His nose may now hold itself as high as anybody's.681.

A derision, a mocking of.
The word is used in precisely the same sense in Wasps 575, where Philo- cleon, after narrating the manner in which great and wealthy criminals abase themselves before the poor and needy dicast, exclaims:
-
On σφραγῖδες as a sign of luxury cf. Clouds 382.683. ἐμβάδ’ ἔχων]
Here ἐμβὰςmeans a coarse rustic shoe, see supra 345 ;
and ὸ ἐμβάδ’ ἔχων is the country clown as contrasted with 6 σφραγῖδ’ ἔχων, the town gentleman.
The ἐμβάδ’ ἔχων is πρότερος, the other has to play the second fiddle, δευτεριάζειν.
A fuller illustration is given of this infra 701- 709.635. πῶς διαγιγνώσκειν]
Here again we are treading in the footsteps of the Platonic Socrates.

But in what way, said he, will they distinguish the respective fathers and daughters ?
In no way, said I.— Republic, v, chap. ix.
461 C, D.
The system of Praxagora has never, I sup­ pose, been anywhere adopted in its entirety, unless, indeed, it was intro­ duced into Persia by the fanatic Maz­ dak in the sixth century of our era ;
see Gibbon'a Decline and Fall, chap.
xlii, and Milman's note.
But the problem here raised must frequently have been faced in Ceylon, Tibet, and other Asiatic regions, where women are the polygamists. "
The choice of a wife," says Mr. Andrew Wilson in his interesting work on Tibet, " is the right of the elder brother;
and among all the Tibetan-speaking people it uni­ versally prevails that the contract he makes is understood to involve a marital contract with all the other brothers if they choose to avail themselves of it."
Consequently there is sometimes but one wife between five or six brothers.
These numerous husbands with their one wife constitute one family;

But how, may I ask, will the children be known ?
And how can a father distinguish his own ?
PRAX.
They will never be known:
it can never be told;
All youths will in common be sons of the old.
BLEP.
If in vain to distinguish our children we seek, Pray what will become of the agèd and weak ?
At present I own, though a father be known, Sons throttle and choke him with hearty goodwill;
But will they not do it more cheerily still, When the sonship is doubtful ?
PRAX.
No, certainly not.
the strong family feeling prevailing amongst them “ prevents any difficulty arising in connexion with the children, who are regarded as scions of the house rather than of one particular member of it." " There is no noticeable differ­ ence in the relationship of a child to his different fathers."
The surplus women are provided for in the Lamian nunneries.
See Andrew Wilson's The Abode of Snow, chapter xxxv.
These customs prevail even among the Tibetan tribe known as the Ladakis, who dwell under the rule of Kashmir among the Western Himalayas.
See Knight, Where Three Empires meet, chap. ix.
Mr. Wilson refers to Caesar De Bello Gallico, v. 14, where it is said that a somewhat similar custom existed amongst the ancient Britons, a little group of ten or twelve having their wires in common.
To some extent also, under the laws of Lycurgus, the like question must have arisen in Sparta.—
Plutarch, Lycurgus, chap. xv.639. καὶ νυ̑ν]
It should be observed that Blepyrus and his wife employ the adverbs νυ̑ν and τότε in exactly opposite senses.
Blepyrus, not realizing that the revolution of which they are speak­ ing is already an accomplished fact, uses νυ̑ν of the old established govern­ ment, and τότεοf, what he considers, the impending γυναικοκρατία.
Praxagora, on the other band, already the chief­ tainess of the just established γυναικο­ κρατία, uses νυ̑ν of that government, and τότε of the pre-existing and now abolished system.
Her νυ̑ν therefore answers to the τότε, and her τότε to the νυ̑ν, of Blepyrus.640.
ἄγχουσι]
This charge is broughtagainst Athenian youngsters in many of the plays of Aristophanes.
See Clouds 1385;
Wasps 1039;
Birds 1348, 1352.
It cannot be doubted that some startling instances of this crime had occurred in his days.
The last words of the line are rendered by the Latin translators, "quomodo non tune eum etiam male concacabunt?"643. μὴ τὸν ἐκείνου]
Sc. πατέρα, the bystander’s father.
So I think we should read for the common μὴ αὐτὸν ἐκεῖνον, which does not give the sense required.
Hitherto, she argues, if a son assaulted his father, the bystanders would not interfere;
it was no business of theirs­ it was not their own father who was being evil entreated-but under the new system, the victim may, for aught they know, be their own father, and they will at once interpose.
Praxagora is still borrowing the arguments of Plato, who draws precisely the same conclusion from the same considera­ .
lions.
“A youth will not now," he says, "strike or insult his senior;
he will be deterred by two considerations, viz.
reverence and fear:
reverence lest he should perchance be striking his own parent;
and fear lest the by­ danders should come to his victim'a assistance, some as sons, some as brothers, some as fathers."
δέος δὲ τὸ τῷ πάσχοντι Rep. v. chap. xii. 465 B.644. ’Επίκουρος] Epicurus, Leucolo­ phus, and Aristyllus were obviously some of the most disreputable young Athe­ nians of the day.
οὺτοι αἰσχροὶ, says the Scholiast of the two former;
and αἰσχροποιὸς οὺτοςοf Aristyllus.
Of Epi­ curus and Leucolophus we know nothing further:
though looking to the Athenian habit of naming children after their grandfathers, some may conjecture that the former was the grandfather of the famous philosopher, and the latter the son of the traitor Adeimantus.
See Frogs 1513.
Aristyllus, however, is again mentioned in Plutus 314, and that in a way which enables us to understand why a kiss from his lips would have been so specially objection­ able.
For it is plainly indicated there, that his face and gaping mouth had, on some occasion or other, been smothered over with dung.
Cario has been telling the needy agriculturists who form the Chorus, that the god ofFor now if a boy should a parent annoy, The lads who are near will of course interfere;

The Chorus are not slow in expressing their surprise and delight at the prospect:
- CHORUS.

CARI0. 0, yes, you'll all be Midases, if only you've the asses' ears.
CHORUS.
0, I'm so happy, I'm so glad, I needs must dance for jollity, If what you say is really true, and not your own frivolity.
Thereupon they break out into a rustic dance, in which the Chorus personate the comrades of Odysseus, chasing Cario, who at first represents the Cyclops Polyphemus, and afterwards the en­ chantress Circe:
— CARIO.
And now I'll change to Circe's part, who mixed her drugs with baleful art;
Who late in Corinth, as I've learned, Philonides's comrades turned To loathsome swine in a loathsome sty, And fed them all on kneaded dung which, kneading, the amongst them flung;
And turn you all into swine will L

CHORUS.
We'll catch you, Circe dear, we will;
who mix your drugs with baleful skill :
Who with enchantments strange and vile ensnare our comrades and defile.
We'll hang you up, as you erst were hung
By bold Odysseus, lady fair;
and then, as if a goat you were, We'll rub your nose in the kneaded dung.
Like Aristyllus, you'll gape with glee, Wee I wee !
wee I Follow your mother, pigs I quoth he.648.
καλαμίνθς]
The speaker makes a slight pause after the first two syllablesin order to bring out the last two, -μίνθης, with greater emphasis.
For undoubtedly, as Dr. Blaydes observes, -μίνθης is intended to remind the au­ dience of the μίνθος with which the face of Aristyllus was bedaubed.
The reference to Aristyllus in the passage translated in the preceding note is:
— If Aristyllus presses his face to yours, you will certainly be smelling of uίνθος.
The old grammarians thought that there must be some connexion between the words μίνθος and μίνθη.
The author of the EtymoL Magn. s. v. μίνθη, after describing μίνθη as a sweet-smelling herb, adds μήποτ’οὐν ἡμεῖς μίνθον κατὰ ἀντίρασιν τὴν δυσωδίαν καλοῦμεν.
Hesy­ chius under the one title μίνθα has τὸ ἡδύομον καί ἀνθρωπεία κόπρος.
And the Scholiast on Plutus 313 appears to think that μίνθη derives its name because it is an ἅνθος ἐν τη̑ κόπρῳ
Φυόμενον.651. γεωργήσων]
That the Athenians loved to cultivate their own lands, though of course with the assistance of numerous slaves, is plain, as from other authorities, so from countless passages in the plays of Aristophanes;
especially the Acharnians and the Peace.
In the latter play, as indeed in the Plutus, the Chorus consists of free Athenian γεωργοί.652. δεκάπουν]
When the (shadοιο of the) gnomon is ten feet long, that is to say, rather more than half an hour before sunset.
In the primitive dials of which Aristophanes is speaking the hour was determined not by the direc­ tion, but by the length of the shadow.
And according to the most careful observation which I have been able to make or procure, an object casts a shadow of " over twenty-two " times its own height at sunset, and a shadow of ten times its own height about thirty­ one minutes earlier.
It is plain there­ fore that the gnomon or (as we are accustomed to call it) index of an Athenian dial was one foot in height, rising vertically from the ground.
Dials of this kind are frequently mentioned by the ancient writers.
Thus Eubulus (apud Ath. i. 14) tells a story of a para­ site who, being asked to supper when the shadow was twenty feet long, that is, just before sunset, óπηνίκ’ άν ΕϊκοσιPRAX.
But this, sir, is nonsense:
it never could be.
That whelp was begotten before the Decree.

—
Come sup to-morrow, says a friend, When tuenty feet the shades extend.
He rises up before the lark, And runs the dial's face to mark.
Lo, when the sun appears in view, The shade is over twenty-two.
Off to his friend's at once he hies, And, Sorry I'm so late, he cries, ᾽Τuas urgent business made me stay.
This, though he came with break of day.
The expression "
Over twenty-two" is quite accurate:
the shadow beyond that distance becomes imperceptible to the naked eye.
Menander's parasite (apud Ath.
vi. 42) measured the shadow on his dial by moonlight :
So in Lucian's Gallus, 9, a poor man, asked out to supper, is described as συνεχὲς ὲπισκοπῶν, όππσάπουν τὸ στοιχεῖον εῖη.
The Scholiast here explains στοιχεῖον by ἡ τοῦ ἡλὶου σκιὰ, ὄταν ᾗ δέκα ποδῶν.
θέλει οὖν εὶπεῖν, ὄτε γὶνεται τὸ ὀψινόν.

The double inter­ rogative without any conjunctive, though almost unknown in English, is so com­ mon in Greek that if I cite from the 77th epigram of Paulus Silentiarius the question τίς run ταῦτα λέγεις;
it is only as an excuse for giving .
transla.
tion of that singular epigram which purports to be a dialogue between a corpse in his grave (speaking perhaps through the epitaph on his tombstone) and an indifferent paser-by:
My name's—
What matter ?
and my home- I care not My birth was noble-
What and if it were not?
Glory I won—
What boots it in the tomb?
And here I lie - Who says so, and to whom?
By the words παρὰ τοῖς ᾶρχουσι he means .. in the dicastic courts," over each of which,as we know, an archon was ac­ customed to preside. "
If one should lose an action before the archons, how and whence will he pay the fine?
It would not be fair to pay it out of the common fund."
πόθεν is taken as the equivalent to ἐκ τίνος, from which ἐκ is to be understood before τῶν κοινῶν.657.
οὐδὲ δίκαι]
She is again borrow­ ing from the Republic, δικαι re καὶ ἐγκλήματα

—V. chap. 12 (464 D).
And Plutarch tells us that this result did actually follow from the legislation of Lycurgus.
See his Ly­ curgus, chap. 24.
It will be observed that instead of directly answering her husband's question, Praxagora raises a preliminary objection, which disposes of the assumption upon which the question is founded.
This is a common meaning of πρῶτον, Before we get to that point.
So in Lysistrata 497, the magis­ trate having said that the money was required for carrying on the war, Lysi­ strata takes the preliminary objection, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲν δεῖ πρῶτον πολεμεῖν.

And even Chremes, who generally acquiesces in Praxagora's scheme, cannot help sharing the apprehensions of Blepyrus in this matter:
κἀγὼ ταύτῃ γνώμην ἐθέμη´᾽, And I too teas thinking the same;
with which Dindorf compares Sophocles, Philoctetes 1448 and Hdt. i. 120.
Compare St. Chrysostom, Hom. i. in Hebr. ad finem, ταύτῃ τίθεται τὰς ψήφους.660.
ἐδάνεισ᾽]
Praxagora deals with the particular case of money lent;
but her argument is equally applicable to every other sort of debt.
Where there is no private property, there can be no lending of money, no selling of goods, no letting of houses, nor any other transaction whereby the relationship of debtor and creditor is created.
Blepyrus therefore passes from the case of a civil debt to that of a criminal liability.
662.
XP. νὴ τὴν Δημητρ᾽]
This entire line (with γε διδάσκεις for at διδάσκει) was formerly given to Blepyrus;
but Bentley saw that the direct address, "you explain the matter well," could not belong to the speaker who im­ mediately adds " now then, let her tell me," and with his usual acumen trans­ ferred the first six words to the friend of Blepyrus.
But this involves a slight further alteration, for Chremes never addresses Praxagora herself, but always speaks to his friend.
For γε διδάσκεις we should therefore read at διδάσκει.
The change from the latter words to the former was inevitable, so soon as they were supposed to be spoken by Blepyrus.
.. By Demeter," says Chremes, in effect, “she has given you a good answer." “
Then let her tell me this," says Ble­ pyrus, propounding his next difficulty.
And then turning to his wife, he adds, .. That difficulty, I think, you cannot get over."
The translation follows the old reading.663.

The genitive is governed by τήν τιμὴν, understood after ἐκτίσουσιν.
Whence shall they pay the penalty for their as­ sault ?
The altae δίκη (for the word is spelled αἰκίας as well as αἰκείας) is men­ tioned in that chapter of the Republic to which we have already so frequently referred (Book v. chap. 12, 464 E), but in a manner which may seem to indicate that the passage was subsequently added to the Platonic sketch as a reply to the Aristophanic caricature.
For he dis­ misses all such questions with the re­ mark that actions for violence and as­ sault, βιαίων and αἰκίας δίκαι, will find no rightful place amongst the warders, for whose education and mode of life he is there endeavouring to provide.τὴν ζημίαν.—Scholiast.

But here it is not confined to one particular eatable.
It is used, as the Scholiast ob­ serves, and as is frequently the case, for food in general.
There seems little, or no, similarity between this regulation of Praxagora, and the Spartan custom mentioned in Athenaeus, iv. 18, with which Bergler compares it.
The Spartan offender was required to contribute a dessert, or some accessories of a dessert, but he does not seem to have been de­ prived of his own meal, or to have been in any way τᾖ γαστρὶ

ἀποδύσουσ᾽]
See above 544, 565.
From the repeated allusions in this play to these light-fingered gentry, we may infer that they were at this time carrying on their trade pretty briskly.
Their modus operandi is described by Euelpides in Birds 496.
He has been stopping too late at a name-day feast, and is leaving the city at night to re­ turn to Halimus, But scarce I emerge from the wall
When I get such a whack with a stick on my back from a rascally thief, that I fall, And he skims off the cloke from my shoulders or e'er for assistance I'm able to bawl.
As ἀποδύω, λωποδύτης, and the like, are specially applied to highway robberies, Praxagora's first words οὐκ ἤν οἴκοι γε καθεύδῃς are a mere joke;
for it is certain that if a man stays at home, says Le Fevre, "tutum eum a λωποδυτῶν per­ petuo fore, seu sub Praxagora, seu sub ar­ chonte quovis."
But she quickly passes to a more serious answer, Nor indeed if you walk abroad.
Dr. Blaydes's transla­ tion, Nor indeed if you sleep out, seems to miss the very gist of the argument.670.

There are to be no more private apartments, no more private houses:

The term λιθος, though strictly, 1 suppose, applicable only to the ϐη̂μa in the Pnyx (see the note on Peace 680), seems to have been loosely applied to any pulpit from which the orators spoke, and especially to the ϐήμaτa in the law courts.

For it was the custom in old times, that whilst the elders reclined at the banquet, the boys entertained them by singing or reciting the praises of famous men and valiant deeds.

It was the same in ancient Rome, " In conviviis pueri modesti, ut cantarent carmina antiqua in quibus laudes erant majorum, et assa voce, et cum tibicine" (assa voce, with the voice alone, un­ accompanied by instrumental music).- Varro (cited by Nonius, ii. 70).
Various passages relating to these old Roman recitations are collected by Macaulay in the Preface to his Lays of Ancient Rome.
And although the practice of employing boys for this purpose seems to have soon died out, yet, of course, the recitations themselves have every­ where prevailed down to comparatively modern times.
During the mediaeval period they were continually kept up in the halls of powerful chieftains and military knights.
By the law of Castile it was part of the training of a Christian knight that during his repast his mind was to be refreshed with the recital, from history, of deeds of ancient heroism.” — Prescott's Ferdinand and Isabella, Introduction, see.
1. The word ῥαψῳδεῖν carries us back to the Homeric poems.681.
κληρωτήρια
Since the discovery of Aristotle's Polity of Athens, it seems impossible to doubt that these were, not the vessels employed for the purpose of the dicastic sortition, but the stalls or balloting booths in which the sortition took place.
The remarks of that treatise upon the dicastic arrangements at Athens are ably explained by Mr. Poste in the Classical Review (vols. vii and x).
The word is supposed to occur three times in that section of the treatisewhich deals with τὰς κληρωὰς ἀρχάς but in chap.
lxiii the manuscript gives the first three letters only, and Mr. Poste's κλη[ρωτριδες] seems far more probable than the κλ[ρωτήρια] of Mr. Kenyon and Dr. Sandys;
whilst the proposal of Dr. Sandys and Mr. Poste to read in the same chapter εἴσοδοι δέ εἰσιν εἰς τὰ κληρωτήια (for εἰς τὰ δι­ καστήια) δέκα, μία τῃ̑ φυλῃ̑ ἑκάστῃ, though I feel no doubt of its correctness, is yet a pure conjecture, on which it would be unsafe to base an argument.
But in the fragmentary sentences which follow chap.
LXIII the word undoubtedly occurs twice, and its meaning is unmistak­ able.
εισι δὲ κανονδες (ticket-grooves) [δέκα ἐ]ν ἑκάστῳ τῶν κληρωτηίων.
[ἐπειδὰν δ᾽] ἐμβάλῃ τοὺς κύβους ὁ ἄρχων, τὴν фυλήν καλ[εί είς τό κ]ληρωτήριον.—Col. 81, lines 15-18.
Here κληρωτήριον cannot be any­ thing else but what Dr. Sandys calls a " balloting chamber," which was probably, as Mr. Poste suggests, a mere movable erection, like our polling booths.
And this accords with the testimony of all the old grammarians, Pollux alone offering the alternative of a “balloting urn."
The Scholiast's note here, τὰς κληρωτὰς ἀρχἀς, may possibly .
refer to the section of the Polity which contains the account of the κληρωτήρια.
These balloting booths Praxagora will bring into the Agora, and set them up (στήασα) beside the statue of Harmo­ dius.
But her subsequent arrangements have nothing to do with any dicastic proceedings.
To say, as Mr. Paste says, that in the Utopia of Praxagora the men were to dine in their dicastic sections (or as he calls them, their juror brigades) involves a complete misunder­ standing of Praxagora's Utopia.
There are now no dicastic sections;
all dicasts and dicastic matters have been swept for ever away.
All citizens are to come to the banquet, and the lots are merely to assort the individual Athenians into their respective banqueting halls.
682.
στήσασα παρ Ἁρμδιῳ]
Having set up the balloting booths by the statue of Harmodius.
The statues of Harmo­ dius and Aristogeiton — not two separate statues, but a group representing the two friends in the act of delivering their assault - stood at the head of the Agora, nearest the Acropolis.
Words- worth (Athens and Attica, chap. xiv) quotes from an inscription a decree granting to some person unknown the daily banquet in the Prytaneum, a front seat at all public games, and the right of erecting a bronze equestrian statue of himself, εἰκόνα ἑαυτοῦ χαλκῆν ἐφ᾽ ἳππου, in any part of the Agora he pleases, save only by Harmodius and Aristogeiton, πλὴν παρ᾽ ῾Αρμδδιον καὶ Ἀριστογείτονα.
However, in their strange adulation of Demetrius Poliorcetes, the Athenians passed a decree χρυσάς είκύνας έρματος στήσαι, τού τε Άντιγάνου καί Δημητρίου (father and son) πλησίον Ἁρμοδίου καὶAnd there by Harmodius taking my station, I'll tickets dispense to the whole of the nation, Till each one has got his particular lot, And manfully bustles along to the sign
Of the letter whereat he's empanelled to dine.
The man who has A shall be ushered awayἈρίστογείτονος.— Diod.
Sic. XX. 46.
Nearly three centuries later, they more appro­ priately decreed to Brutus and Cassius εὶκόνας χαλκάς παρά τε τήν τοū Άρμοδίου καί τήν τοū Άριστογείτονος, forasmuch as they too were tyrannicides.
—Dio. Cass. xlvii. 20.
It was for a somewhat similar reason that the Chorus of men in the Lysistrata resolved to take their stand beside this group of statuary, with .. swords in myrtles dressed" to bid defiance to the tyranny to which the women aspired.
— Lys. 633. " Some records of the group have been traced in coins and vases, and, it is believed, even copies in sculpture.
By com­ parison of these it is still possible to appreciate the skill with which the figures of the two youths, rushing forward together to an attack, were so composed as to display the action of both in effective combination from whichever side they were regarded."- Watkiss Lloyd, Age of Pericles, chap. xviii.683. ἐν όποίῳ γράμματι]
Having ascer­ tained in what letter (that is, in what banqueting hall) he is to dine, δέον εἰπεἱν δικάζειν εἰπε δειπνῖν, says the Scholiast, merely, however, meaning that δικάζειν would have been the word required under the pre-Praxagorean arrangements.
For while these banquet­ ing halls were still law courts, it was the practice, in the early morn, to affix on each hall, in which a court was to be held that day, one of the second ten letters (from A onwards) of the Greek alphabet.
The second ten letters were employed because the first ten (from A to K) were, appropriated for a different purpose in the process of assorting the dicastic sections.
These dicastic sections, having been fully formed, ascertained the halls in which they were to sit by drawing tickets in the κληρωτήριον :
the section, for instance, which drew a ticket marked with the letter A, went off to determine law suits in the hall over the portals of which the letter Λ was affixed.
But under Praxagora's system all this is changed.
There are no dicastic sections to be assorted, and the first ten letters are therefore available for the banqueting halls themselves.
Every citizen draws his individual letter at Praxagora's balloting booths, and will be duly admitted to the banquet pre­ pared in the hall distinguished by the same letter.
Hence in the Plutus the word γράμμα is used to signify as well the letter on the ticket (277,278) as the hall distinguished by that letter (972).684.
ἐκ τοῦ βη̑τ’]
Τὸ βη̑τα here, like τὸ θη̑τα in the following line, seems to stand for the entire class who have drawnthat particular letter, and οἱ ἐκ τοῦ βη̑τα to signify those of the B class.
Aristo­ phanes does not, as the translation does, select the first three letters of the alphabet.
He picks out, as most appro­ priateto his purpose, the letters B, Θ, K. The Beta class are to dine at the στοιὰν βασίλετον (a στοὰ frequently mentioned by classical authors, as, e. g. by Aristotle, Polity of Athens, chap. vii, wherein, when a court sat, the ἄρχων βασιλεὺς presided), ἐπεὶ, as the Scholiast says, τὸ βασίλετον ἀπὸ τοῦ B ἄρχεται.
The Kappa class are to go to the ἀλφίτων στοιὰν (ἐν ᾑ τὰ ἄλφιτα ἐπωλεȋτο, Hesychius), so giving an opening to the jest of Ble­ pyrus, ἴνα κάπτωσιν ;
that they may gobble up their food voraciously ?
Where the Theta class are to go is more doubtful.
The Scholiast says τούς θήτας, τούς μισθω- τούς είς τό Θησείον' έπεί πάλιν άπό τοū θήτα.
άρχετ. Orjra apxrrat.
But the Theseium was not a δικαστήριον or a στοὰ, nor is there any ground for supposing that the θη̑τα were to go to a hall whose name commenced with 6, any more than the κάππα were to a hall commencing with κ.
That joke was confined to the βη̑τα.
Words- worth (Athens and Attica, chap. xxii) says “the θη̑τα cannot refer to the Theseum, which is not a stoa:
but it refers to the stoa of Zeus Eleutherios, which stood parallel to the stoa Basi­ leios, or παρὰ ταύτην.
(Harpocration in λειος.)
And this was parallel to the stoa Basileios in site, as θη̑τα is to βη̑τα in sound.
”This is very probable;
and for my own part, I think that if Aristo­ phanes had seen his way to making a joke on θη̑τα, he would have made it:
and that his not doing so shows that we are not to look for any jest, or pun, or play upon words.
688. μὴ ’ξελκυσθῃ̑]
It frequently hap­ pened that the state of business did not require that all the ten courts should sit:
and on these occasions some of the ten dicastic sections must have drawn blanks, that is, tickets inscribed with no letter.
Blepyrus supposes that in like manner some of the citizens will still draw blanks;
and not unnaturally,To the Royal arcade;
to the next will go B ;
And C to the Cornmarket.
BLEP.
Merely to see?
PRAX.
No, fool, but to dine.
BLEP.
'Tis an excellent plan.
Then he who gets never a letter, poor man, Gets never a dinner.
PRAX.
But 'twill not be so.
Therein be plenty for all, and to spare.
No stint and no grudging our system will know, But each will away from the revelry go, Elated and grand, with a torch in his hand
And a garland of flowers in his hair.
And then through the streets as they wander, a lot Of women will round them be creeping,since it would be impossible in these halls to accommodate all the 30,000 Athenian citizens.
But of course a Utopia does not trouble itself about such trifles as these;
and Praxagora assures him that every citizen will get a ticket, and, by means of the ticket, a dinner.691.
στεφάνῳ ... δᾳ̑δα]
She is de­ scribing the κῶμος, the drunken revel or procession which followed a feast, and of which the wreath and the torch were the invariable concomitants.
In the Plutus (1040, 1041) two persons discern in the distance a youth of whom they were talking, and they observe to each other, Athenaeus (ri. 42) cites from "
The Scythian " of Antiphanes, Plutarch (Pyrrhus, chap. xiii) tells us that a Tarentine citizen, wishing to dissuade the people from sending for Pyrrhus, came into the assembly, pre­ tending to be tipsy, with a wreath and torch, such as drunkards bear, and pro­ tested that they had better be merry while they could, for they would have mighty little merriment after Pyrrhus had come :

Usually they wore a wreath ofroses, says Barnes on the last-mentioned passage, referring to Anacreon.
And as to the torch, see infra 1150;
Wasps 1331,1390.697.
έτέρα]
It is not absolutely clear whether έτέρα describes the new speaker, or is part of her speech;
and some place a comma after παρ’ ἐμοὶ δ’, and construe έτέρα τις together, as in Lysistrata 524.
This would leave for her speech παρ’ ἐμοὶ δὲ καὶ καλλίστη καὶ λευκοτάτη, which does not seem sufficiently explicit.
And on the whole I think the speech must be παρ’ ἐμοὶ δ’ έτέρα (sc. μεῖραξ), καὶ καλλιστη καὶ λευκοτάτη.
The fact is that έτέρα is wanted in both connexions, but can, as it seems to me, be less easily spared from the speech than from the description of the speaker.
698. ἐξ ὑπερῴου]
This is one of the many passages which show that, in the time of Aristophanes at all events, the apartments of the women were on the upper floor.
Another occurs 961 infra, where the girl is implored to come down (καταδραμοῦσα) to open the door for her lover.
A third is in Thesm.
482, where a wife does go down (καταβαίνω λάθρᾳ) for that purpose.
It is unnecessary to cite passages from other authors.7C8. διφόρου συκη̑ς]
The δίφορ
ος συκη̑ was a fig-tree which bare fruit twice a year, but the word δέφεσθαι in the following line, quite apart from such passages as Peace 1348, 1349, makes it plain that it is here, as Paulmier says, employed to signify τὸ αὶδυῖον.“ 0 come to my lodging," says one, “ I have got Such a beautiful girl in my keeping."“
But here is the sweetest and fairest, my boy," From a window another will say," But ere you're entitled her love to enjoy Your toll to myself you must pay.
”Then a sorry companion, flat-visaged and old, Will shout to the youngster It Avast !
And where are you going, so gallant and bold, And where are you hieing so fast ?
’Tis in vain ;
you must yield to the laws of the state, And I shall be courting the fair,Whilst you must without in the vestibule wait, And strive to amuse yourself there, dear boy, And strive to amuse yourself there.
"709. ἐν τοῖς π ροθύροισι]
In the vestibule :
where lovers awaited the summons to their mistresses' presence.
In the pathetic epigram (Anthology, Plato, vii) on " Lais dedicating her mirror to Aphrodite," she describes herself as The epigram may be, prosaically and imperfectly, rendered as follows:
- I, Lais, whilom of my smiles so free, Who kept a swarm of lovers at my door, Now, Aphrodite, bring my glass to thee;
What I am now, I do not care to see, It cannot show me what I was before.
We should no doubt read ἐνὶ προθύροις for ἐπὶ προθύροις in the " Inscription on a Woman's Bath" (Anthology, Anon. 887), which invites all women to in­ crease their charms and loveliness by bathing in its waters.
"Is it a wife who comes?" it says, " her husband will love her more than ever.
Is it a virgin ?
she will soon have lovers in plenty.
Is it a courtezan ?
The language is evidently borrowed from that of " Lais and her mirror.
"The lovers would be ἐπὶ ται̑ς θύραις (infra 997,1114;
Clouds 467), but ἐν τοι̑ς προθύροισιν (Plato, Protagoras, chap. vi), which were adorned with statues, seats, and the like;
see Anthology, Posi­ dippus, 13.
Lovers of women like Lais are described by St. Chrysostom as δια­ νυκτερεύοντες ἐν τοι̑ς ἐκεινων προθύροις Horn, vii in Eph. (50 A).715.
καταστη̑σαι]
To establish, institute, set going.720. αἆται]
She points to the Chorus who, for this purpose, as Dindorf re­ marks, represent the free Athenian women generally.
The expression ίφαρ­ πάζειν Κύπριν two lines below, doubtless originally borrowed from some tragic poet (Agathon probably, or Euripides), is repeated here from Thesm.
205. It means “ to steal away the love which of right belongs to others."
Cf. infra 921.724. κατωνάκην] κατωνάκη MSS. " Cor­ rigendum credo κατωνάκην,slave-fashion.

727.
θαυμάζετε]
Blepyrus now follows Praxagora off the stage, and Chremes, two lines later, returns to his house to arrange and bring out his chattels.
Of Blepyrus we hear nothing more until the closing scene of the play, when he, his little daughters, and the Chorus all go off to join the festivities, which under the new system are gratuitously provided for the public.
Meanwhile two more or less farcical scenes are intercalated to illustrate the practical working of the new arrangements as to the community of goods and the coin­ munity of women.
First comes the "scene of the two citizens," who are the two neighbours of Blepyrus, Chremes and the husband of the second woman ;
the former, in obedience to the law, preparing to take his goods to the public stores, whilst the other rails at him for his folly in doing so.
After this comes the " scene of the three Hags," all eager to avail themselves of the privileges which Praxagora had promised them, supra 617, 618.729.
τὴν οὐσίαν]
With these words Cbremes disappears into his house;
and the stage is now left vacant.
Whilst he is busy indoors with his chattels, the Chorus sing an ode which is now lost (its sole trace being the survival of the word XOPOY in the Ravenna MS.), but which, judging from the usual practice of Aristophanes, we may safely conclude to have been anti­ strophical to the ode supra 571-581, and to have celebrated the brilliant success of Praxagora's exposition of her scheme, wherein she had more than fulfilled the anticipations expressed in , the strophe.
As soon as the song is concluded, Chremes reappears with his goods, and proceeds to marshal them on the stage after the fashion, as Bergler observes, of a great religious procession at a Panathenaic or other festival.
One is to be the κανηφόρος, the Queen of the May, the young and noble maiden who bore the holy basket (Achamians 242, 253;
Lysiatrata 646).
Next to her walks the διφροφόρ
ος carrying her chair (Birds 1552).
Afterwards come the ίδριαφόροι and σκαφηφόροι,the resident aliens and their wives and daughters, carrying pots of water, and dishes filled with cakes and honeycombs, κηίων καὶ ποπάνων πλήρεις.
See Photius, Hesychius, Harpo­ cration, s. vv.;
Pollux, iii. segm. 55. Nor were the θαλλοφόροι wanting, the feeble old men who walked in the pro­ cession carrying their branches of olive;
see Wasps 544 and the note there.
And doubtless if we knew more fully the details of a Panathenaic procession, we should find something to explain all the other directions which Chremes gives in the passage before us.
The Scholiasts quite misunderstand the scene, and imagine that the procession is one, not of household goods, but of female slaves, and accordingly take κιναχύρα to be ὄνομα δούλης, and explain στρέψασα by κλέψασα, κιθαρῳδὸς by ἡ ἀλετρὶς, and so on.730.
κιναχύρα]
The first article brought out, and placed in the van of the pro­ cession, is the κιναχύρα, a word which does not, I believe, occur elsewhere, but which, from its obvious derivation (παρὰ TO κινει̑ν τὰ ἄχυρα, Bergler), can signify nothing else than the "bran-sifter," a sort of sieve-like instrument for sepa­ rating the fine flour from the bran.
We may infer from the present passage (1) that it was not an agricultural or mill implement, but a kitchen utensil in a private house;
(2) that in figure it was tall and slender, for it seems certain that Aristophanes is selecting the mostCHR.
My sweet bran-winnower, come you sweetly here.
March out the first of all my household goods, Powdered and trim, like some young basket-bearer.
Aye, many a sack of mine you have bolted down.
Now whereas the chair-girl ?
Come along, dear pot, (Wow !
but you're black :
scarce blacker had you chancedappropriate articles to represent the various members of the procession, and not raising a laugh by selecting the most inappropriate;
and (3) that the flour was poured in at the top with the bran still intermingled, and arrived at the bottom as fine flour with no admixture of bran.
It here represents the κανηφόρος, the fair maiden who led the procession, to whom in the Achar­ nians (242-253) the direction πρόïθ’ ἐς τὸ πρόσθεν is given, and to whom there, as here, are applied the terms καλὴ καλω̑ς, “with your sueet face and in your sueet uay,” the καλὴ referring to the maiden's personal beauty, and the καλω̑ς to the charming way in which she dis­ charges her duty.
Speak, my fair, and fairly, Henry V, last scene.
Finally ἐιτετριμμένη, poudered, as applied to a woman, means "with cosmetics rubbed in," whilst as applied to the κιναχύρα it refers to the floury state in which it would naturally be found.
See Lysi­ strata 149.
In the lines cited by the Scholiast on Birds 1551 from the "Gods " of Hermippus, we should probably read ώσπερ αἱ Κανηφόροι Λευκοι̑σιν ἀλφίτοισιν ἐντετριμμέναι, not ἐντετριμμένοις with the Scholiast, nor ἐντετριμμένος with Meineke, nor ἐντετριμμένοι with Bothe.
734. ἡ διφροφόρ
ος ]Immediately after the basket-bearer walked the διφροφόρος (Birds 1552), who carried the chair on which, I presume, the bastet-bearer took her seat, when the procession arrived at Athene's Temple.
The ex­ pression παρ’ αἰτὴν in line 737 has refer­ ence merely to the juxtaposition in which the two articles are placed by Chremes.
In the procession she followed immediately behind the leader.
See Birds 1551, 1552, and the Scholiast there.
Here the chair-girl is repre­ sented by the pot, black and sooty by constant use :
and if the part could be taken by a slave (which, however, is hardly probable), it might be conjec­ tured that there is an allusion here to Ethiopian slaves, who (some years later at least) were considered very fashion­ able at Athens.
In the Characters of Theophrastus, xxi, one example of " Ambition in trifles " is for a man ἐπι­ μεληθη̑ναι ὄπως αὐτῳ̑ ὀ ἀκόλουθος (supra 593) Αἰθίοψ ἔσαι.735. τὸ φάρμακον]
He means the hair- dye.
ὡς TOV Λυσικράτ
ος φαρμάκῳ μελαί­ νοιτος αὑτου̑ τὰς πολιάς.
—Scholiast.
It was doubtless from this passage that Lysicrates and his hair-dye became pro­ verbial in later days, a man who dyedhis hair black being popularly called a second Lysicrates.
Dr. Blaydes quotes Apostol. x. 97 Λυσικράτης ἔτερος’ ἐπὶ τω̑ν these abusive epithets are borrowed from the Scholiast on 630 supra, where see the note.
The expression οὐδ’ εἰ, if the reading is correct, is strangely elliptical:
" integra enim oratio foret," says Kuster, " νὴ Δία μέλαινά γ’ (ὤστε οὐκ ἆν εἴης μελαντέρα) οὐδ’ εἰ τὸ φάρμακον κ.τ.λ.”
And Markland on Eur. Iph. in Taur. 583, referring to this passage, . observes "locum optime explicat.
doc­ tissimus Kusterus.
”737. κομμώτρια]A tire-maiden.
ἐμπλέ­ κτρια, ἡ κοσμου̑σα τὰς γυναι̑κας.—Scholiast.
The tire-maiden, the chair-girl, and the parasol-holder (Birds 1550), who is not mentioned here, were attendants on, and mere appendages to, the noble virgin who bare the holy basket.
Those who follow are independent members of the procession.
We are not told what household articles repre­ sent the κομμώτρια, the ύδριαφόρος, and the σκφηφόρος.739.
ἡ κιθαρῳδός]
He is unquestionably referring, as Brunck observes, to the domestic cock.
Who else would have roused the sleeper before daybreak?
Who else would have sung τὸν ὄρθριον νόμον ?
Even if the present description could have admitted any other inter­ pretation, all doubt would have been removed by the terms in which Aristo­ phanes elsewhere speaks of the bird of dawning.
"
He was once the Great King," says the poet in the Birds, “the Autocrat of all the Persians:
and stillTo boil the dye Lysicrates employs) And stand by her.
Come hither, tiring-maid ;
And pitcher-bearer, bear your pitcher here.
You, fair musician, take your station there, You whose untimely trumpet-call has oft Roused me, ere daybreak, to attend the Assembly.
Who's got the dish, go forward;
take the combs
Of honey;
set the olive branches nigh;
Bring out the tripods and the bottles of oil;
The pannikins and rubbish you can leave.
CIT.
I bring my goods to the stores!
That were to be A hapless greenhorn, ill endowed with brains.
I'll never do it;

and still so mighty is his power, that all mankind spring at once from their beds όπόταν νόμον ὄρθριον ᾄσῃ.”— Birds 489. Cf. Id. 495, 496;
Wasps 100.
The feminine is used because the musician in the real procession was a female;
and should not have given a handle to such idle suggestions as the Scholiast's ἀλετρὶς, and Meineke's μύλη, the hand-mill, in support of which he cites Pherecrates apud Athenaeum, vi. p. 263, and Nico­ stratus, Stobaei Florileg.
IxL. 12. Of course here, as in Wasps 815, the bird produced on the stage is merely a model or picture.742.
σκάφην λαβών]
He who has taken the σκάφην with the intention of bearing it as σκαφηφόρ
ος in the procession.
We have already seen, on 729 supra, that the σκάφαι were filled with κηρία and πόπανα.746.
ἐγὼ καταθήσω]
Now another door opens, the door upon which Praxagora had stealthily scratched, supra 34, and the husband of the second woman again comes out, as he did supra 327.
He is a heady and obstreperous indi­ vidual, the very opposite in all respects to the tolerant and accommodating Chremes, who had from the very first expressed his willingness to adapt him­ , self to the regulations of the new re­ public.
See supra 472.751.
οὐδὶν πρὸς ἔπος] ’Αντὶ του̑, ὡς ἔτυχεν, ἔνεκα μηδενός.— Scholiast.
For no reason.
In the passages cited by Dr. Blaydes from Lucian's Hermotimus, 36 and Philopseudes, 1, the words have a totally different meaning, being equi­ valent to the Latin nihil ad rem.753.
οὖτος]
Whilst he is in the midst of his soliloquy, be suddenly perceives the long row of chattels which Chremes has been ranging in the street, and calls out to know what it all means.
757.
“Ιέρωνι τῷ κήρυκι]Κη̑ρυξ οὖτος, ὄστις τὰ πιπρασκόμενα ἐκήρυττε.—Scho­ liast.
The meaning is, "Are you send­ ing them to be sold by public auction ?"
Hiero was a praeco ad merces turbam qui cogit emendas.
—Horace, A. P. Praeconi, or praeconis voci, bona subjicere was the ordinary Roman phrase for a sale by public auction.
So in Hdt. vi. 121 the words To χρήματα αὺτου̑ κηρυσσόμενα ὑπὸ του̑ δηοσίου ὠνέεσθαι are rightly ren-So idly and so brainlessly away, Before I've fathomed how the matter stands. —

The speaker asks this question in accents of shrill surprise.
He can hardly believe his ears.
761. ρ̍α̣δίως]
The precise meaning of ρ̍α̣δίως here is very uncertain.
Le Fevre's rendering facile dictu has been preserved by all subsequent revisers of the Latin translation.
But more probably we are to take the words κακοδαίμων εἶ as equi­ valent to “You will come to misfortune," and so, when the speaker is asked “ How ? " he retorts "
Easily enough.
"772.
ἰδὼν ἐπειθόμην]
The speaker is not applying these words directly to himself:
he is using a proverbial ex­ pression, When I sate it, I believed, or, as our own proverb goes, Seeing is believing.
For a similar use of a proverbial saying, compare Frogs 51 κἀ̣τ’ ἔγωγ’ ἐξηγρόμην.
The word ἐπειθόμην is altered by Brunck into ἆν ἐπιθόμην,and by Dr. Blaydes into πειθήσομαι, but there is really nojustification for these corruptions of the text.
773.
λέξουσιγάρ]
This and the three similar ejaculations which follow are merely introduced for comic effect.
The first two, indeed, “Aye, talk they tciU," and “Aye, speak they will," are significative of scorn and contempt.
But the second two, “Aye, disbelieve they will," and " Aye, destroy they will," .have not, and are not intended to have, any meaning whatever.775. ἀπολεῖς]
You will be the death of me.—Plutus 390.780. τῶν ἀγαλμάτων] ’Επείδη ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πλεῖστον ra ἀγάλματατῶν θεῶν ὑπτίαςrat χεῖρας ἔχουσιν.
—Scholiast.
By χεῖρ’ ὑπτίαν he means a band with its palm upward, as a beggar would hold it for an alms, or an official for a bribe.
It exactly answers to the χεῖρα κοίλην of Thesm.
937. We learn incidentally from Birds 518 that a sacrificer wa3 accustomed to put a portion of the sacrificial meat into the outstretched hand of the god.784.
τῶν προὔργου τι δρᾶν]

Why, if perchance an earthquake came,merely the Athenians who regarded an earthquake as a token of divine dis­ approval, requiring them to desist from the course they might then be pursuing.
Some eight years before the date of this play, an earthquake had caused Agis and the Spartan army to abandon the invasion of Elis, ἅρτι γὰρ τοῦ στρα­ τῆς χώρας, διαΦῆκε TO στράτευμα.—Xen.
Hell. iii. 2.24.
About three years after the date of this- play, Agesipolis, in­ vading Argos, managed to disregard the warning of a σεισμὸς;
but even he was compelled to abandon his enterprise on the occurrence of a second warning, this time by πῦρ ἀπότρ
οπον.— Id. iv.7.4-7. And see Thucydides, iii. 89.
But these διοσημίαι are more frequently noticed as breaking up a popular assembly.
See SchOman (De Comitiis,i. 13), who refers to Thuc.v. 45;
Plutarch, Nicias, chap. x;
Acharnians 171;
Clouds 580-7.
That at Rome, too, thunder put an end to a meeting is well known from the story of the tribune Apuleius Saturninus.
When he was endeavouring, with the aid of the country tribes, to force his revolutionary measures through the Assembly, ό πολιτικὸς ὄχλος ὲβόα, ώς γενο­792.
trip ἀπότροπον]
Lightning,
It derives its epithet ἀπότροπονfrom the notion that where the fire of God, πῦρ Διὸς, had fallen, the foot of man must never tread:
τὰ βαλλόμενα τοῖς κεραυνοῖς ἀνέμβαταμένειχωρία.
—Plutarch, Pyrrhus, chap.xxix.
In like manner it was believed that neither dog nor bird of prey would approach a body struck by lightning, δοκοῦσικαὶ κύνες καὶ ὄρνιθεςὰπέχεσθαι τῶν διοβλήτωνσωμάτων;
and such bodies were often neither burned nor buried, but fenced round, and left on the spot.
—Id. Symposiacs, iv.
2. 3. From sub­ jects so serious as the earthquake and the thunderbolt, the speaker descends to a ridiculous superstition, " ifa marten cat run across the way."
Kuster refers to Theophrastus, Charact.
xvi, περὶ δεισι­ δαιμονίας, where it is said of the super­ stitious man, καὶ τήν ὁδὸν ἐὰν παραδράμη̩
See also Frogs 196.795.
ou λάβοιςὄποι]
The speaker's meaning is clear enough, but nothing can be more obscure than the words in which he expresses it.
He is still harping on the distinction between giving and taking, on which he has been dwelling with such relish, supra 778- 783.
And so, when Chremes talks of giving in his goods to the public stores, he retorts, " You mean, to receive, don't you?”
But it is difficult to extract this or any other meaning from the words in the text, unless indeed we are to assume (which to my mind is im­ possible) that he is merely substituting λάβοις or λάβη̩ς for the other's καταθείην, and leaving the ὃποι unchanged, thoughOr lightning fell, or a cat cross the street, They'll soon cease bringing in, you blockhead you!
CRit.
A pleasant jest, if I should find no room To bring my chattels!
CIT.
To RECEIVE, you mean.
'Twere time to bring them, two days hence.
CHR.
How mean you ?
CIT.
I know these fellows;
voting in hot haste, And straight ignoring the decree they've passed.
CHR.
They'll bring them, friend.
CIT.
But if they don't, what then ?
CHR.
No fear;
they'll bring them.
CIT.
If they don't, what then ?
CHR.
We'll fight them.
CIT.
If they prove too strong, what then ?
CHR.
I'll leave them.
CIT.
If they won't be left, what then ?as inappropriate to λάβοις as it was suit­ able to καταθείην.
It seems to me that the right expression would be either οὐχ ὁπόθεν λάβοις or λάβη̩ς (this I see has also occurred to Dr. Blaydes) or μὴ γὰρ ὄπον λαβεῖν ἔχοις.
But this is purely conjectural, and does not justify an alteration of the text.796. ἔνης]
The day after to-morrow.
εἰς τρίτην.—Scholiast, Harpocration, Suidas. τὸ μετὰ τὴν αὔριον.— Hesychius.797.
τοίτους]
He points to the audience as representing the Ἀθηναίους ταχυ­ βούλους and μεταβούλους;
quick to make up their minds, and quick to change their minds;
ever ready to pass a resolution, and equally ready to ignore it when passed.
“Were any man to peruse the resolutions ye have voted.” says Demosthenes (De Syntax, 35), " and then go through the deeds ye have done, nothing would persuade him that the resolutions and the deeds were those of the same people.
Ye vote resolutions which are just and noble and worthy of Athens, but ye do not follow them up by a single deed.
"800. κομίσωσι]
The repetition of this question, though a stumbling-block to some, seems not only natural but necessary.
The speaker would not go on to a fresh question whilst the first remained unanswered.
But what if they don't bring them?"
“They're sure to bring them." " Well, but what if they DON'T, I say."802.
κωλύσωσι]
All the manuscripts and editions have πωλῶσ’nuTo, sell the things, a remark which nobody has attempted to explain, and which does not seem to admit of any satisfactory explanation.
I have ventured to sub­ stitute κωλύσωσι, which is what the context requires, and is to some extent confirmed by the Scholiast on 862 infra, where see the note.
The thread of the dialogue is as follows:
"They'll bring them sure enough."
"But what if they don't ? " “We'll fight and compel them."
"What if they are the stronger?" "I'll leave them and walk off." ..
What ifthey won't let you walk off ? "
To this Chremes has no reply ready.807.

It would be far more to his taste.
" Multo sane lepidius ei videretur plus quam triginta dies prius cacare.
”—Brunck.
And yet he would be suffering pain all that time.
See supra 366.
The expression πλεῖν ἢτριάκονθ’ ἡμέραςιs repeated from Acharnians 858.
The πάνυ in the line above is, of course, as Bergler remarked, merely ironical.
And Paulmier and others infer from this passage, perhaps rightly, that Antisthenes was.
a man of niggardly spirit, always very unwilling . to part with his property.
809. Καλλίμαχος]
Οὕτος πένης, says the Scholiast.
But, poor as he was, he yet had more goods to bring in than the once wealthy and luxurious Callias (son of Hipponicus), who, having inherited a colossal fortune, had wasted his sub­ stance in riotous living.
More than twenty years ago he had begun to "shed his feathers" (Birds 283, 284);
but he cannot even yet have reached the utterly destitute condition in which he died, since we find him shortly afterwards in command of an Athenian contingent at Corinth.

And about six years later, Lysias, in the matter of the estate of Aristophanes (50), says that the grandfather of Cal­ lias assessed the rateable value of his estate at 200 talents, and that Callias himself, on his father's death, was esteemed the richest man in Hellas;
and yet the rateable value of his whole estate did not then amount to two talents.

τοιαῦτα ψηΦίσματα]
Resolutions eagerly voted by the Assembly, and presently rescinded or ignored.
He gives three instances:
(1) the case of the salt, (2) the case of the bronze coinage, and (3) the case of the property tax.
We know nothing of any of these ψηΦίσματα, except what we are told in the present passage, or may infer from the language used.814.
περὶ τῶν ἁλῶν]
It is impossible to tell whether this was a tax upon salt, or an attempt to lower its price.
The Scholiast takes the latter view, ὲψηΦίσαντο γὰρ ᾱὐτοὺς εὐωνοτέρους εἰναι, καὶ τὸ ψήισμα ἅκυρον γέγονε.
And his statement is generally accepted.
In either case the resolution failed to effect its purpose.815.
χαλκοῦς]
The expression ἔναγχος, quite recently, with which the case of the property tax is ushered in (823 infra, shows that the case of the bronze coinage belonged to an earlier date;
and no doubt the speaker is referring, as Kuster pointed out, to the bronze coins issued in the archonship of Callias (the Callias who followed Antigenes), very shortly before the exhibition of the Frogs of Aristophanes.
See the notes on the antepirrhema of that play.
They were issued because the supply of silver from the mines of Laureium was stopped by the presence of the Lacedaemonian garrison at Deceleia, and were doubt­ less called in soon after the war wasclosed, and the fountain of silver was again in flow.

τὴν γνάθον]
That it was the custom of the Athenians to carry money in their mouths is, of course, well known.
See Wasps 791 and the note there.
ἀπῆρα, I made of.825.
τεσσαρακοστῆς... Εὐριπίδης]
Οὕτος ἔγραψε
τεσσαρακοστὴν εἰσενεγκεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς οὐσίας εἰς τὸ κοινόν.—Scholiast.
That this τεσσαρακοστὴ was, as the Scholiast says, a direct property tax of 2½ per cent., just as the πεντεκοσιοστὴ mentioned infra 1007 was a direct property tax of one-fifth of a unit per cent.
on the taxable capital is, in my judgement, absolutely certain.
No other percentage could have been expected to raise the enormous sum of 500 talents;
whilst a property tax of one-fortieth would not exceed an income tax for one year of 68.
in the £.
Mr. Grote's objections (History of Greece, chap. lxxv) rest on no substantial foundation.
He says that on one occasion (De Symmoriis, sec. 33) Demosthenes alludes to a pro­ position for raising 500 talents by direct property tax as something extravagant, which the Athenians would not endure to hear mentioned."
But this is not so.
Demosthenes says that the Athenians would not stand a direct property tax of one-twelfth (which would be required to raise 500 talents).
He does not suggest that they would not stand a direct property tax of one-fortieth, which was the proposal of Euripides:
on the contrary, he speaks of a tax of one-fiftieth as if it would create no difficulty whatever.
It seems to me that Euripides (whether a son of the great poet or some other Athenian of the same name) was one of the officers (πορισταὶ)whose duty it was both to devise and levy taxes (see the note on Frogs 1505):
that there had arisen some urgent necessity for 500 talents, possibly on account of the expensesMy cheek with coppers;
then I steered away And went to purchase barley in the market;
When just as I was holding out my sack, The herald cried, No copper coins allowed !
Nothing but silver must be paid or taken !
CIT.
Then that late tax, the two-and-a-half per cent., Euripides devised, weren't we all vowing 'Twould yield five hundred talents to the state ?
Then every man would gild Euripides.
But when we reckoned up, and found the thing A Zeus's Corinth, and no good at all, Then every man would tar Euripides.
incurred by reason of the Anti-Spartan League:
that Euripides proposed to meet this need by a property tax of 2½ per cent.;
that the people were overjoyed to think that they could get out of their difficulties by so small a sacrifice;
that the tax was accordingly voted, and Euripides proceeded to assess it;
but that, no sufficient allowance having been made for the vast decrease of tax­ able capital which had followed the disastrous termination of the Pelopon­ nesian War, it was found that a tax of 2½ per cent, would be quite inadequate (οὐκ ἤρκεσεν) to realize anything like the amount required;
and that there­ upon the popular feeling ran high against the financier who proposed it.
Very possibly at that time, as in the time of Demosthenes, it would have required a tax of one-twelfth, and not merely of one-fortieth, to raise 500 talents.
This ψήΦισμαtherefore became one of those which were passed and bare no fruit.
κακολογεῖν.—Bisetus.828. ὁ Διὸς Κόρινθος]
The origin of this proverbial expression is explained in the note on Frogs 439, to which the reader is referred.
Here it will be sufficient to say that the words ό Διὸς Κόρινθος (Corinthus, son of Zeus, the eponymous founder of Corinth) were used over and over again, by way of menace, to the revolted Megarians by the Corinthian ambassadors, till the Megarians rose up, defeated the Corin­ thians and secured their own indepen­ dence.
Hence the words became a proverbial expression applicable either to wearisome iteration, as in the Frogs, or to grand professions which are not justified by the result, as in the present passage.
830. οὐ ταυτόν]
The cases are not analogous.831. άς γ'έγώ]
This is of course in­ tended merely to express the speaker's contempt for the sex.
Men are accus­ tomed καταχρ
υσου̑ν and καταπιττου̑ν, women, he thinks, are fit only κατουρείν.
Therefore he will give them as wide a berth as possible.
834. Κήρυξ]
A crier enters to summon all the citizens to the state banquet:
νυ̑ν γὐρ ου̑τω ταυ̑τ' ἒχει, he says, meaning that under the old democracy only a few distinguished guests were enter­ tained by the state in the Prytaneum;
but now the invitation is extended to every citizen.
Some would change κη̑ρυξ into κηρύκαινα, referring to 713 above;
but there the crieress was to be the immediate personal assistant of Praxagora.
That she was not going to dispense with the services of men generally is shown by the o τὴν μα̑ζαν φέρων of 851 infra;
and the present speech is plainly that of a man, and not of a woman.837. ὃποι]
This is the reading of the best MSS.

σωσιν.—Scholiast._
The ῤιπὶς was a fan, which played the part of the modern bellows (as we still say, to fan the fire).
See Pollux, x, segm. 94, and the com­ mentators there.
So in Acbarnians.
665-670, the Chorus pray that the Muse will come to them keen and bright, " As the spark leaps up from the oakwood ashes, stirred by the breath of the fan " (Rudd), ὲρεθιζόμενος οὐρίᾳ ῤιπίδι.
The meaning here is that the fish-cutlets are broiling on a well-fanned fire.
846.
Σμοίος] Κύριον ὄνομα, αὶσχροποιὸς εὶς yvi αῖκας.—
Scholiast.
A double mean­ ing runs through lines 845-847, for Bergler is no doubt correct in saying that Smoius is charged with the same bestiality which, a generation earlier, was attributed to the filthy Ariphrades (Knights 1285, Wasps 1283, Peace 885),848.
Γέρων]
Dindorf observes that Geron occurs in some inscriptions as a proper name, and it is unquestionably so used here;
but the bearer of the name was undoubtedly a γέρων, a shabby .
old fellow who, having been rigged out in a new suit of clothes from the public stores, now fancies himself a youth again, and struts about, joking and laughing, with "another youth."850. έμβὰς, τρίβων]
Which he formerly uεed.
As to έμβὰς see the note on 345 supra.
In his speech, " In the matter of the estate of Dicaeogenes," 20, Isaeus says that a claimant who had reduced Cephisodotus to penury by unjustly depriving his cousin, the mother of Cephisodotus, of her share in the estate, now upbraided Cephisodotus ὄτι έμβάδας πένητα πεποίηκεν.

he held it the part of a fool to obey the behests of the law, supra 768.

He has no alternative;
whether he like it or not, he must needs obey.862.

Chremes commences his little string of repartees with the very question with which the second speaker had concluded his.
And this is, I think, the meaning of the Scholium, έξ ὦν πρώην ό μὴ βουλόμινος τὴν οὐσίαν καταθιίναι (i.e. the second speaker) έπηρώτα.864.
καταγελω̑σι]
If they laugh to scorn your threats of a summons ?
The thread of this short dialogue is as follows:
"I must do what the State orders." " What if the women will not let you ?" "
At them, head foremost." " What if they repel you with blows ? " " I'll go to law, I'll summon them." " What if they laugh your summons to scorn?"
Bergk, apparently not perceiving the continuity of the dialogue, would destroy it by substituting, out of his own head, κάπελω̑σι for καταγέλωσι.
I cannot help thinking that if all the MSS.
had read κάπελω̑σι, the genius of a Bentley or a Person would have been equal to restoring καταγελω̄σι.872.
μηχανήματος]
Chremes goes off to deposit his chattels, and share in the public entertainment.
The other, left behind, endeavours to excogitate a scheme by which he also may share in the feast, and yet not deposit his chattels.
His exclamation shows that he has hit upon a plan, the particulars of which he does not divulge, but which he hopes may accomplish his purpose, and away he goes after his companion.876.
δειπνήσοντα]
The accusative is used, says Dr. Blaydes, " quasi praecess­ isset non βαδιστέον sed χρή."
Cf. Birds 1237.
After this line, as after 729 supra, the Ravenna MS.
inserts XOPOY, showing that the scene of the Two Citizens, which is now followed without any interval by the scene of the Three Hags, was formerly separated from it by a choral ode.
Judging from analogy we may suppose it to have been a strophe, to an antistrophe separating the scene of the Three Hags from the entrance of Praxagora's handmaiden;
but if there ever was an antistrophe after line 1111, it has absolutely dis­ appeared, and left not a wrack behind."
Even the XOPOY of the Ravenna MS. is wanting there.877.
τί ποθ' ἃνδρες]
The scenery seems to have remained unchanged throughout the play;
and Blepyrus comes out of the central house at 1128 infra, just as he has already done at 311 and 520 supra.

(Here again was a choral song, now lost.)HAG.
Why don't the fellows come ?
The hour's long past:
And here I'm standing, ready, with my skinthe Second Woman respectively, have changed their occupants;
and one of them has become the abode of an ancient Hag and a young girl.
It is the case contemplated in Praxagora's speech, supra 693-701, but the pro­ ceedings do not exactly follow the lines there shadowed out For one thing, both the girl and her young lover are in full revolt against the regulations of Praxagora.
For another, no Gaffer Hob­ nail, no snub-nosed Lysicrates, comes to claim precedence over the youth.
It is difficult to feel absolute certainty as to the stage arrangements, but in my judgement the Hag is peeping out through the half-closed door (Peace 980, 1), whilst the girl is looking from the window overhead.
The contention between the two could hardly have been carried on, had the girl been standing in one of the balconies (menianorum) which, according to Vitruvius (v. 6, ed Schneider), formed part of the stock scenery of the comic stage:
and indeed such balconies are never mentioned in the Comedies of Aristophanes, and were probably a later invention.

ψιμυθιῳ]
White lead;

—Ben Jonson's Sejanus, ii.

In 1072 infra another Hag is described as άνάπλεως ψιμυθίου.
And in some lines, preserved by Athenaeus, xiii.
6, from the " Wreath-sellers" of Eubulus (to which Bergler refers), harlots are described in both ways as περιπεπλασμέναι ψιμυθίοις and ἀνάπλεῳ ψιμυθίου, doubtless a reminiscence ofthe present scene. "

No authorities need be cited to show that the epithet " Ionian," in this connexion, signifies.

Horace, Odes, iii. 6. 21.
The historian Satyrus, remarking that Alcibiades excelled everybody in everything, says that he excelled the Ionians in luxury, the Thebans in gymnastics, the Thessalians in horsemanship, the Spartans in endur­ ance, the Thracians in hard drinking;
έν, 'Ιωνίᾳ μὲν ών, 'Ιώνων έφαίνετο τρυφερώ­ τερος.—Athenaeus, xii. 47.
Up to this point the Hag alone has made her ap­ pearance, but now the girl looks out from the window above.
Plastered with paint, wearing may yellow gown, Humming an amorous ditty to myself, Trying, by wanton sportiveness, to catch Some passer-by.
Come, Muses, to my lips, With some sweet soft Ionian roundelay.

sing then, and I'll sing against you.

Here, talk to this, and vanish:
but do you, Dear honey piper, take the pipes and play A strain that's worthy you, and worthy me.
(singing)
Whoever is fain lovers bliss to attain, Let him hasten to me, and be blest;
888. it ὂχλου]
This self-depreciation, like the common I hare already detained you too long of our platform speakers, was no doubt intended merely to elicit from the audience a counter expression of encouragement.
The words are used in precisely the same manner by the Athenian orator in Thuc. i. 73.890.
τούτῳ]
Τῳ αίδοίῳ. — Scholiast, referring no doubt to a δερμάτινον αίδοȋον, a penem scorteum, called in Lysistrata 109 an ὂλισβον.
She throws one of these to the girl, and bids her amuse herself with that.
διαλέγου is used in much the same sense as εἰς λόγον έλθη in Knights 806.891. αὺλητά]
Some have thought that the Bag is speaking to a private musician of her own;
but, of course, she is ad­ dressing the theatrical αύλητὴς, who was there for the very purpose of playing accompaniments to the songs.893. εἲ τις]
They now commence their rival madrigals, the shrill cracked treble of the Hag alternating with the full rich tones of the girl.
The Hag has the first turn.
The first three songs are in the trochaic metre;
the second and third corresponding as strophe and anti­ strophe.
The anapaest in the second place of lines 893 and 894, though un­ usual in Aristophanes, is, of course, perfectly regular, τὸ τροχαīκὸν κατὰ μὲν τούτους τε, καὶσπονδεȋον, καὶ ὰνάπαιστον.— Hephaestion, chap. vi. ad init.896.
πεπείροις]
Ripe, mature.
Some MSS.read έμπείροις, experienced, and in good truth, though the two words are quite different in meaning, they would come to the same thing here.
TO σοφὸν, sollertia in re amatoria, is described as τὸ ἒμπειρ
ον by the Scholiast.
And the argument is that repeated in Lucian's .
Amores 25, γυνὴ μὲν ούν, ὰπὸ παρθένου τω̑ν νέων σοφώτερ
ον.
The last words are borrowed from Eur.
Phoenissae 529, 530, where, however, they are used in a totally different connexion.
897.
έθελοι]
Scilicet ὴ νία.
The first four lines of the song are a comparison between two classes, the νέαις and the πεπείροις.
The last four are a com­ parison between two persons, the girl and herself.
The Hag has now had her say, and the girl's turn has come.
The idea of prefixing musical terms to the following songs is, and some of the musical terms themselves are, bor­ rowed from the Rev. Rowland Smith'
sFor knowledge is sure with the ripe and mature, And not with the novice, to rest.

translation.904.
παραλελεξαι]
The Hag's song was addressed to her expected lovers;
but the girl, rejoicing in her youth, makes a direct attack upon the Hag.
You have picked out the shaggy hairs (a sign of age) from your eyebrows, she says.
—Hesychius.
παραλελέχθαι τὰς τρίχας τὸ τὰς περιττὰς ἀφαιρεῖσθαι.—Pollux, ii. segm. 35. κἀντέτριψαι, and hare rubbed paint into your face, supra 782, Lys. 149.
μέλημα, Death's darling, “cura et deliciae mortis" as Kuster translates it.
Cf. infra 973.906. TO τρη̑μα]
At this direct attack, the Hag loses her temper, and utters imprecations which it is not easy or desirable to interpret with exactness.
Le Fevre supposes τρη̑μα to be “eam lecti partem, per quam funiculi intende­ bantur undo Homero τρητοῖς λεχέεσσιν,” and ἐπίκλιντρ
ον a cushion or pillow.
But cf. Lysistrata 410.
ὄφις is used, both in Greek and in Latin erotics, to denote a cold and languid lover.
Two trochaic feet have dropped out of this antistrophe,and I have inserted, in brackets, Bergk's ψυχρὸν, and Blaydes's σαύτη, not as thinking that they are the genuine words of Aristophanes, but to show the reader the metrical completeness of the song.911.
αἶ αἶ]
Instead of bandying threats with the Hag, the girl pursues the doubtless more aggravating course of lifting up her voice in a young maiden's love-ditty.
The words ἀλλ’ J μαῖα, the Scholiast says, are addressed πρὸς τὴν γραυ̑ν, but although on the stage the girl may, by way of mockery, so address them, yet in the song itself μαῖα signifies an overindulgent old nurse, such as she who brought Romeo and Juliet together.
Ὀρθαγόρας is the name which this Juliet bestows on her Romeo.
The transla­ tion might perhaps lead the reader to suppose that the love-sick maiden in the ditty is really bewailing her mother's absence, whereas she merely regards it as affording a good opportunity for a stolen meeting with her lover.
If this song is intended to correspond with the double song which follows, as can hardly be questioned, its opening lines must have been greatly amplified, possibly by the introduction of a further portion of the original love-ditty, from which Aristophanes is borrowing.918.
τὸν ἀπ’ ᾽Ιωνίας τρόπον] ᾽Ως μαλα­ κω̑ν ἐκείνων ὄντων.—Scholiast.
We have already seen (supra 883) that the Ionians were notorious for their dissolute and voluptuous habits.
The girl's song and demeanour may have justified thisGIRL.
(teneramente) 0 dear, what will become of me ?
Where can my lover be flown ?
Mother is out;
she has gone and deserted me, Mother has left me alone.
Nurse, nurse, pity and comfort me, Fetch me my lover, I pray;
So may it always be happy and well with thee, 0, I beseech thee, obey.
HAG. (fortissimo)
These, these, are the tricks of the harlotry, This, the Ionian itch!
GIRL. (con spirito) No! no!
you shall never prevail with me, Mine are the charms that bewitch.
HAG.
Aye, aye, sing on :
keep peeping, peering out Like a young cat.
They'll all come first to me.
GIRL.
What, to your funeral ?
A new joke, hey ?charge, but the old lady is certainly going too far when the imputes to her rival the terrible vice of the Lesbians.
It would seem that this vice (λεσβιάζειν) was at Athens described by its initial letter X (λάβδα or λάμβδα), ἀπὸ του̑ ἄρχοντος στοιχείου, as the Scholiast says.
The same vice is imputed to the flute­ girl in Wasps 1846.921.
ὑφαρπάσαιο]
See supra 722.
The girl closes the contest with a little out­ burst of triumphant insolence.
“Never shall you intercept (wile away) my lovers (τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐραστὰς, Scholiast),” she sings, " Never shall you destroy or carry off the charm of my youth."
With Bergk and Velsen, I have given these last three lines to the girl, for by τὴν ἐμὴν ὤραν we must necessarily under­ stand "my youth.”
It cannot mean, as Bothe, thinking it spoken by the Hag, explains it, " horam, h. e. tempus mihi constitutum atque assignatum lege nova."926. ἐπ’ ἐκφοράν]
I have arranged the speakers in these lines, and indeed fre­ quently elsewhere in this scene, some­ what differently from preceding editors.
The Hag is reduced to iambics, but still asserts her legal rights. "
Sing what you will," she says, " and peep out like a cat:
no man will go first to you:
all will come first to me." " First to you?" retorts the girl, " 0 yes, to your funeral, I suppose.
Is that a novel jest, Mother Mouldy?”
The same question ἐπ’ ἐκ­ φοράν;
occurs in a very similar passage in Plutus 1008, and is there too ad­ dressed to an ancient coquette.
Both there and here some translate it "to carry away your goods";
but in both places it clearly means to carry you outto burial (cf. Frogs 170), and is so taken by all the best scholars.
So Lysias, De Caede Eratostbenis 8, ἐπειδὴ δέ μοι ἡ φθείρεται.
Very possibly the passage in our Plutus was repeated from the first comedy of that name.
so that the joke was a stale one at the date of the Ecclesiazusae.
The girl excuses herself for using an old joke by explaining that it was all the more suitable to an old woman.928.
τοὐμὸν γη̑ρας]
Perhaps this little speech should conclude with a note of interrogation.
As the words stand, they must be translated
It is not my age that will vex you;
meaning, I suppose, that .
it is not by her age, but by her superior wisdom and experience, that she will wile away the girl's lovers. "
Not your age ?" says the girl, " what then ?
your beauty I suppose:
your rouge and ceruse." 929. ἡ ἄγχουσα]
"Αγχουσα (or as some spell it ἔγχουσα) is the plant now known as Dyer's Alkanet (Anchusa tinctoria), of which we are told by Miller and Martyn that it "
Is cultivated in the south of France for the deep purplish red colour of the roots.
It imparts a fine deep red to oils, wax, and all unctuous substances;
its chief use is for colouring plasters, lipsalves, &c.” Hellenic ladies used it as rouge;
and in the British Museum (Third Vase Room, Case 43) some of this rouge may still be seen in a pyxis or rouge-pot discovered in the Greek cemetery at Naucmtis, and ascribed by the Museum authorities to the best period of Greek art.
Both the alkanet and the ceruse (supra 878) were constant accessories to a Greek toilet, and are frequently mentioned in that character.
Thus in Xenophon's Oeconomicus, chap. x, Ischomachus tells us that when he saw his wife (amongst other things) ἐντετριμ-HAG.
No, very old.
GIRL.
Old jokes to an old crone.
HAG.
My age won't trouble you.
GIRL.
No ?
Then what will ?
Your artificial red and white, perchance.
HAG.
Why talk to me ?
GIRL.
Why peeping ?
HAG.
I ?
I'm singing With bated breath to dear Epigenes.
GIRL.
I thought old Geres was your only dear.
HAG.
You'll soon think otherwise:
heR come to me.
O here he is, himself.
GIRL.
Not wanting aught Of you, Old Plague.
HAG.
0 yes, Miss Pineaway.
GIRL.
His acts will show.
I'll slip away unseen.
HAG.
And so will I.
You'll find I'm right, my beauty.931. 'Επιγένει]
Epigenes does not seem intended to represent a real person;
but Geres was doubtless known as a disreputable old man, and therefore, the girl thinks, a fitting partner for the old Hag;
φαλακρὸς οἶτος καὶ πένης, says the Scholiast.
Epigenes is appa­ rently the name of the youth who enters three lines below:
but it would be profitless to prefix that name to his speeches;
since it is merely as a typical νεανίας that he comes before us.934.
ὁὃί γὰρ αιτός]
A youth enters, with a torch in his hand (infra 978), obviously a reveller who has left the dinner table (supra 692).
It is im­ possible that he can be carrying the torch through all the ensuing scene;
and I imagine that he deposits it in some place, where Blepyrus finds it, infra 1150.
The words ὁόξει γε καὶ σοὶ in the preceding line mean Ies, and yourself will be of that opinion soon.937. μεῖζον φρονῶ]
Am much more sensible, know much more about things, than you.
She means that her opinion as to the youth's object in coming will be found more correct than the girl's.
The rivals now profess to retire, so as to yield a free field for the youth to disclose the object of his quest:
but in reality each is endeavouring to outwit the other.
The girl does indeed go in, but she is keeping an eye on the Hag's movements, and reappears the moment the other is gone.
The Hag at first does not withdraw at all, but stays by the door till she has overheard whom the youth is seeking:
she then does retire, but keeps a watch on him, and reappears80 soon as she thinks it desirable to vindicate her legal rights.988-945.
Tyrwhitt was the first to arrange these two stanzas properly, and to show that they are in the most familiar and most famous of all scolium- metres, viz. that of "Harmodius and Aristogeiton."
The metrical system will be found in the note to Wasps 1225.
The first two lines are identical with the hendecasyllables of Catullus and Martial "Doctis, Jupiter, et labo­ riosis."
Tyrwhitt also suggested that the commencement of the first stanza is borrowed from one of the scolia pre­ served by Athenaeus, xv. 50, And this seems probable enough.
See also Fritzsche, Quaest.
Aristoph. p. 48.
But the last line seems also a borrowed line, and possibly the entire stanza is a parody of some lost scolium.
In the passage before us each stanza appears to be a soliloquy:
the youth being un­ aware of the proximity of the Bag;
and the Hag's recitation being an " saide," inaudible to the youth.943. τἀπὶ Χαρξένης]
Cbarixena is de­ scribed by some as a fool (εὐήθης καὶ μωρά.
—Scholiast. ἐπὶ μωρίᾳ διεβεβόητο.- Hesychius);
by others, as a writer ofYOUTH.
0 that I now might my darling wool
Nor first be doomed to the foul embrace
Of an ancient bag with a loathsome face;
To a free-born stripling a dire disgrace!
HAG.
That you never, my boy, can do !
'Tis not Charixena's style to-day ;
Now the laws you must needs obey Under our democratical sway.
I'll run and watch what next you are going to do.
YOUTH.
0 might I catch, dear gods, my fair alone, To whom I hasten, flushed with love and wine.
GIRL. (Reappearing abore)
That vile old Hag, I nicely cozened her.
She deems I'm safe within, and off she's gone.
But here's the very lad of whom we spake.
(Singing)
This way, this way.
Hither, my souPs delight!
amatory songs and melodies (ποιήτρια ἐρωτικῶ—Hesychius.
ποιήτρια κρουμότων —Etymol. Magn. Eustathius on Iliad ii. 711).
And possibly the two cha­ racters are not absolutely inconsistent.
The phrase οἰα τἀπὶ Χαριξέιης passed into a proverb applied to performances without restraint or reason.
It is used not only by Aristophanes, but also by Cratinus and Theopompus (Etymol. Magn).
The passages are collected in Kuster's note.
οὶμώζων in the pre­ ceding line is translated by Brunck magno tuo malo.949.
ἐξηπάτησα]
The Hag having gone in, the girl immediately reappears;
and she from the window above, and her lover from the street below, indulge in a little amatory duet.952.
δεῦρο δή]
That these two songs are antistrophical, as Bentley pointed out, it is impossible to doubt:
the first line, and the last three, are identical in both, and there are many traces of correspondence in the intermediate portions.
But in one or other of them, if not in both, the metrical system has fallen so completely out of gear, that it would require far more conjectural pressure than, in the absence of any help from the MSS., it is permissible to exert, to bring them back into harmony with each other.
Brunck and some others, contrary to all authority and, as it seems to me, contrary to all sense and likelihood, take the first song from the girl and transfer it to the Bag.
The neuter φίλον is used here for the masculine, and in the antistrophe for the feminine, by way of endearment.
958. μέθες]
Let go, set me free:
not from love itself but from the misery of disappointed love.
Le Fevre trans­ lates it, sine, Brunck concede, Bothe cessa, desine me vexare.
The way in which she wishes to be set free is described in the two following lines.
ταῦτα εὶποῦσα εἰσέροχεται, says the Scho­ liast;
and this must of course be the fact, if the youth's song is, as Kuster insists, a παρακλαυσιθυρν, since that is the wail of an excluded lover, and is incompatible with the sight of his mistress.
But there seems no reason why the girl should re-enter the house, until the Hag comes out of it, infra 976;
and in my judgement this is not a παρακλαυσίθυ
ρ
ον at all, but the youth from below is singing to the girl at the window, just as she from above hasO come to my arms, my love, my own, O come to my arms this night.
Dearly I long for my love ;
My bosom is shaken and whirls,
My heart is afire with a wild desire
For my boy with the sunbright curls.
Ah me, what means this strange unrest, This love which lacerates my breast ?
O God of Love, I cry to thee;
Be pitiful, be merciful, And send my love to me.
YOUTH. (Singing.)
Hither, 0 hither, my love, This way, this way.
Run, run down from above Open the wicket I pray:
Else I shall swoon, I shall die!
Dearly I long for thy charms, Longing and craving and yearning to lie
In the bliss of thy snow-soft arms.
O Cypris, why my bosom stir, Making me rage and rave for her ?
O God of Love, I cry to thee, Be pitiful, be merciful, And send my love to me.
Enough, I trow, is said to show the straits I'm in, my lonely grieving.
Too long I've made my serenade:
descend, sweet heart, thy chamber leaving,been singing to him.964.
πληκτίζεσθαι]
Properly to fight, to exchange blows with, but the word is frequently used in the sense here attached to it.
Le Fevre translates it " lascivire cum tuis natibus," and refers to Hesychius, who has πληκτίζεσθαι ύβριστὴς, and again πληκτικώτερον' ὑβρι­ στικώτερ
ον.
And ὑβριστὴς, as Le Fevre remarks, “vox est amatoria."
With καταπεσὼν κείσομαι above, Kuster com­ pares Theocritus, iii. 53 κεισεῦμαι δὲ πεσω̍ν.973.
J δρυσοδαίαλτον]
He addresses her by all the endearing names he can think of.
She is his " golden-glittering, gold-bespangled darling" μέλημο, cf. supra 905), “ a sprig of Aphrodite," " a bee of the Muses," " a nursling of the Graces," .. the embodiment of soft de­ lights."
The expression μέλιττα
Μούσης refers to the honied sweetness of her song;
compare Birds 224,749-751;
just as Sophocles, from the sweetness of his verse, was called the Attic bee.
πρόω­ πον is the personification, representa­ tion, of a thing.
θρέμμα " a nursling."
A variant θρύμμα is well supported, but I prefer θρέμμα, a word very common in such collocations as this.
Nothing can be more natural than to say that she was reared by the powers who confer grace and loveliness;
like Sappho, δν Κύπρις καὶ Eρως συνάμ’ ε̄τραφον (Antipater Sidonius, Epigram 70).
Bergler refers to some dactylics of Ibycus preserved by Athenaeus, xiii.
17,976.
οὗτος]
The door is opened, but the wrong woman comes out.
Expect­ ing his love, he is confronted by the Hag.
She asks if he is seeking her.
He replies with an indirect but strong negative, πόθεν;
Is it likely ?
see Frogs 1455 and the note there.979. ’Αναφλύστιον]
The seaport of Anaphlystus, immediately to the south­ west of the silver mines of Laureium (Xen. De Vect. iv. 43), formed one of the Attic domes;

HAG.
Hi knocking?

YOUTH.
A likely joke.
HAG.
You banged against my door.
YOUTH.
Hanged if I did.
HAG.
Then why that lighted torch ?
What seek you here ?
YOUTH.
Some Anaphlystian burgher.
HAG.
What’s his name ?
YOUTH.
No, not Sebinus;
whom you want belike.
HAG.
By Aphrodite, will you, nill you, sir.
YOUTH.
Ah, but we're not now taking cases over Sixty years old :
they've been adjourned till later;
Anaphlystian really had the misfortune to bear the ill-sounding name of Sebinus;
the double appellation (’Αναφλύστιος as if from ἀναφλᾶν, and Σεβῑνος as if from βινεῖν) prompting the unsavoury jest which is found here, and in Frogs 427.
In the next line, the Hag, whether stimulated by the jest, or getting tired of all this dallying, grapples with the youth, and endeavours to drag him into the house.982.
ίπερεξηκοντέτεις]
'Afro τῶν δικῶν.
ἔλεγον γὰρ ἀεὶ, τὰ πρὸ τόσων ἐτῶν δικάζο­ μεν.-Scholiast.
The courts heard causes of different dates at different times;
at one time, causes commenced or entered for trial (it may be) more than two years previously:
at another, causes commenced or entered for trial (it may be) since the preceding Munychion.
Imitating their language, the youth says, " We are not taking to day γυναῖκας over sixty years old," like the Hag:
"we are taking those under twenty," like the girl.
" Loquitur quasi de litibus forensibus," says Bergler, " et intelligit aetates mulierum."
εἰσάγειν is a well- known forensic term meaning " to intro­ duce an action before the dicastery," see the Wasps, passim.
This duty de­ volved upon the presiding Archon, who was thence called the εἰσαγωγεύς.983.
εἰσαῦθις ἀναβλεβλήμεθα]
We haVe adjourned them to some other time.
At the commencement of Plato's Sym­ posium (chap. 2) Aristodemus is repre­ sented as coming to Agathon's house, just as the guests were about to begin the banquet, and Agathon said to him, " 0 Aristodemus, you are just in time to join our feast:
if you have come on any other business, εἰσαῖθις ἀναβαλοῦ, put it off till another time...
So Lucian, TO λοιπὰ εἰσαῦθις ἀναθμλώμεθα.
Pseudo­sophista, ad fill.
ἀναβαλλέσθαι τὴν δίκην is the proper legal phrase for adjourning an action.987, 988.
κατὰ τὸν it, Παιτοȋς νόμον]
No­ thing is known of this law or custom of the Paetians, who were a Thracian tribe, along whose territory Xerxes passed in his march from the Hellespont to Then­ saly.
—Hdt.vii. 110.
But it was obviously familiar to the Athenians at the date of this play, and must have laid down some rule, which it was optional for a person to adopt, or repudiate, of his own free choice, without incurring any penalty.
The youth then says, “ I have my free choice to take you or not, in accordance with the Paetian law," and the Hag replies, Had you your free choice about your dinner?
Had you not to .
dine at the place assigned you by the state ? " supra 684- 686. " So here:
you must play the part the state assigns you."
Παιτοȋς is the reading of the best MSS., and is confirmed by the Scholiast, who says, Παιτοί· ε̃θνος μέν ἐστι Θρα̣κιόν.
ἔπαιξε δὲ παρὰ τὸ παίειν.
And it was the reading of every edition before Brunck, who substituted πεττοȋς from the only MS.
of which he was cogni­ zant for this part of the play, a MS.
of little value, and as full of futile emen­ dations as if it were a recension by a modern critic.
But it is infinitely more probable that Παιτοȋς should have been corrupted into the familiar πεττοȋς than that the converse corruption should have taken place.
Nobody has attempted to explain the reference to πεσσοὶ, a game apparently bearing a slight re­ semblance to our “draughts,” though played with fewer pieces and doubtless under very different rules.
However, if πεττοȋς were the true reading, the refer­ ence must be to some, now unknown, rule of the game.
If there were a rule that a player when he had an oppor­ tunity of taking one of his adversary's pieces, might either do so.
or else refuse to take it, without the liability of being (as we say) huffed, that is, losing hisWe're taking now those under twenty years.
HAG.
Aha, but that was under, darling boy, The old regime:

You didn't, did you, dine by Paetian law.
YOUTH.
Don't understand you:

HAG.
Aye, but me first:

HAG.
Who is he, I wonder.
own piece, the reference, if we read πεττοȋς, might be to that rule.
991. κρησέραν]
The word is not, I believe, used elsewhere by any writer of the classical period, and its meaning is not altogether clear.
But it seems to me that the basket called a κόφινος was made of wicker cased in coarse linen, and that κρησέρα was the name given to this casing.
Both the Scholiast and Suidas define κρησέρα as τὸ περιβολαιον τω̑ν κοφίνων, and I think that the author of the Etymologicum Magnum would have done the same, had he not been led astray by his own fanciful derivation of the word from κάρα (on the analogy, I presume, of κρήδεμνον), and so con­ sidered it the ἐπι-βολαιον, not the περι­ βολαιον, of a κόφινος.
The word was after­ wards used to denote various articles, probably made of this pack-cloth, such as a strainer, a linen bag, the fan of a winnowing machine.
Galen (in his “linguarum Hippocratis explicatio ”) de­ scribes it as ή του̑ ἀλεύρου πτίσις ὀνομαζο­ μένη, μάραιππος δέ τίς ἐστιν αὐτὴ λινου̑ς.
The application of the word in the present line is not more clear than its signification.
Le Fevre takes the speaker to mean that the Hag might indeed supply him with a κρησέpa, but that is not what he is wanting to-day.
Bergler, with more probability, suggests that she is herself addressed as a κρησέρα, and that this was a cant term at Athens for a common prostitute.
Anyhow there is a play on the words κρ
ουστέον, κρούση̣ς. and κρησέρα.992.
θαυμάζεις]
The Hag speaks as if she were a shy and modest young maiden, whom it is surprising to find out of doors alone.
The youth tells her, in effect, that she is maturo propior funeri.
and that her fittest lover is the " under­ taker," who paints the oil bottles carried out and buried with the dead.
See the note on 537 supra.
And be warns her not to be seen at the door, ἐπὶ θύραισιν, lest the undertaker should think she is a corpse, and come to carry her out.998.
ἐγώ σε]
The full sentence would be otta σε 6 τι βούλει.
See the note on 583 supra.
This is a somewhat peculiar ellipse;
and there is much to be said for the Scholiast's reading ἔγωγε, which he explains by βούλομαί at ἀπιέναι ἐπὶ θάνατον.999. μ’ ἔλαχε κληρουμένη]
Who by lot acquired tHe.
She is alluding to the common notion that every soul at its birth was allotted to the charge of some divinity or δαίμων, who was thence­ forward its guardian and companion through life.
Ἑλλήνων μὲν οὖν, says Origen, οἱ σοφοὶ λεγέτωσαν δαίμονας εἰλη­ χέναι τὴν ἀνθρωπίνην ψυχὴν ἀπὸ γενέσεως.
But we, he says, have been taught by the Lord not to despise one of His little ones, knowing that in Heaven their angels do always behold the face of His Father which is in Heaven.
—Adv. Cels. viii. p. 767 B. Many passages relating to this Hellenic belief are cited by the Commentators on the well-known νεκυία in the Phaedo (chap. 57).
Thus Men­ ander (in Clemens Alexandrines, Strom. v. 14. 130) So in Theocritus, iv. 40, Battus, be­ wailing the loss of Amaryllis, says, αἲ at τω̑ σκληρω̑ μάλα δαίμονος ὅς με λέλογχεν.
And in Alciphron, iii. 49, a parasite ex­ claims & δαȋμον, ὄς με κεκλή
ρωαι καὶ εἳληχας, ὡς πονηρὸς εἶ.
The passage in the Phaedo, to which reference has already been made, is as follows:
YOUTH.
Who paints from life the bottles for the dead.
Away !
begone!
he'll see you at the door.
HAG.
I know, I know your wishes.
YOUTH.
And I yours.
HAG.
I vow by Aphrodite, whose I am, I'll never let you go.
YOUTH.
You're mad, old lady.
HAG.
Nonsense!
Pit drag you recreant to my couch.
YOUTH.
Why buy we hooks to raise our buckets then, When an old hag like this, let deftly down, Could claw up all the buckets from our wells ?
HAG.
No scoffing, honey :
come along with me.
YOUTH.
You've got no rights, unless you've paid the tax, One fifth per cent.
on all your wealth — of years.
HAG.
0 yes, you must;
0 yes, by Aphrodite, Because I love to cuddle lads like you.1001. ἄξω]
With these words she clutches hold of.
the youth, and en­ deavours to drag him indoors.
He, feeling the tight and eager grasp of her skinny fingers, likens her to a κρεάγρα, which in strictness means a flesh-hook (see the note on Wasps 1155), but which was figuratively applied to any grappling-hook for fishing up articles from the depths, as here a bucket from a well.
“
Why should we spend our money," he asks, " in buying grappling.
hooks for our buckets, when this old Hag, if deftly let down, could just as easily claw them up with her fingers ? "1006. ἐτω̑ν]
This is Tyrwhitt's felicitous emendation for the ἐτω̑ν of the MSS.
and older editions.
Boeckh (Public Economy of Athens, iv.
8) supposes that there really was at this time a small tax of one-fifth of a unit per cent.
on the taxable capital of Athens.
And as debtors to the state were ἄτιμοι, de­ prived of the rights and privileges of citizens, the Hag could not exercise any privilege given her by law, until she had paid to the state one five-hundredth of her possessions.
But for τω̑ν ὄντων (bonorum), as Tyrwhitt observes, the youth maliciously substitutes τω̑ν ἐτω̑ν (annorum), perhaps insinuating that her " years " were her only possessions Τω̑ν ἐμω̑ν made no sense at all:
for.
course, a citizen had to contribute one five-hundredth of his own, not of some body else's, possessions.1012.
τουτί]
She brandishes a scroll wherein are contained the words of the law which she presently recites.
1021.
Προκρούστης]
I shall this day become a Procrustes.
The name, of course, is borrowed from that legendary robber whom Theseus slew, who fitted all his captives to the length of his own bed­ stead, by shearing off the extremities of such as were too tall, and stretching the limbs of such as were too short.
But there is no allusion to the legend itself;
the name is employed merely as a play on the προκρούειν of lines 1017, 1018 supra:
a play which I have not attempted to preserve in the translation.1023.
ἀφαιρη̑ται]
He does not mean ἀφαιρεȋσθαι βία̣, take me atcay by force, as the Commentators, without any ex­ ception, understand it.
The expression ἀφαιρεȋσθαι, or (more commonly) ἀφαι­ ρεȋσθαι εἰς ἐλευθερίαν, is a technical one, constantly used by the Orators in the sense of bailing out an accused person (see, for example, [Demosthenes],against Neaera, p 1358):
and the reply to the youth's question conclusively shows that such is its meaning here.1025.
ὑπὲρ μέδιμνον]
No man can bail you out;
for no man's credit extends beyond one medimnus of barley now.
The contracts of women, the Scholiast tells us, were restricted by law to the value of one medimnus:
now, therefore,YOUTH.
But I don't love to cuddle hags like you, Nor will I:
never!
never!
HAG.
0 yes you will, THIS will compel you.
YOUTH.
What in the world is THIS ?
HAG.
THIS is a law which bids you follow me.
YOUTH.
Read what it says.
HAG.
0 yes, my dear, I will.
Be it enacted, please to listen, you, By us the ladies:

if the youth refuse, Then may the beldames lawful violence use
And drag him in, in any way they choose.
YOUTH.
A crusty law!
a Procrustéan law !HAG.
Well, never mind;
you must obey the law.
YOUTH.
What if some Man, a friend or fellow-burgher, Should come and bail me out?
HAG.
A Man, forsooth ?
No Man avails beyond a bushel now.
YOUTH.
Essoign I'll challenge.
HAG.
Nay no quillets now.men and women having changed places, the same limit is imposed upon the contracts of men.
νόμοςἠν, he says, ἀντέστραπται ή πολιτεία.
Bergler cites Isaeus, De Hered.
Aristarch. p. 80, ό γὰρ νόμ
ος διαρρήδην κωλύει παιδὶ A ἐξεȋναι συμ­ βάλλειν, μηδὲ γυναικὶ, πέρα μεδίμνου κριθω̑ν.
And Kuster refers to similar statements by Harpocration, s. v. Ὄτι παιδὶ, and Dio Chrys. p. 638 D. A medimnus was about a bushel and a half of our dry measure:
the medimnus containing nearly twelve gallons, and the bushel eight.φασιν έτέραν τινά.— Etymol.

It was the technical expression for an excuse (such as ill health) put forward upon oath for the purpose of escaping some public duty.
Thus in his speech, De Falsa Legatione, p. 379, Demosthenes alleges that Aeschines, being elected to go on the third embassy to Philip, felt that for divers reasons he could not safely go, ἔδει δὲ μένειν.
πω̑ς οὖν ;
(hoic was he to manage it ?) ἀρρωστεȋν πρ
ο­ ροτονήθη.
In our law the word essoign was employed to signify " an excuse forhim that is summoned to appear and answer to an action, by reason of sick­ ness or infirmity or other just cause of absence."
ἐστρατεύοντο οἱ ἔμποροι.— Scholiast.
The law of Athens, for the encouragement of commerce, wisely exempted every bona fide merchant from liability to military service.
And many, no doubt, sought to avail themselves of this exemption, by pretending to be mer­ chants when they were not really so.
In the Plutus, an applicant is cross­ examined for the purpose of discovering his trade, which was really that of a common informer;
and amongst other questions, he is asked, "Are you an ἔμπορος?”
To which he replies, ναὶ, σκήπτομαί γ’, ὄταντύχω. " I am :
at least I allege so, on occasion."
Plutus 904. .
The youth has three schemes for escaping the cruel exigency of the law;
first he will be bailed out by one of his friends or neighbours;
if that will not do, he will get excused on the ground of ill health;
and as a last resource, he will pretend to be an ἔμπορος, and claim exemption from military service.
His comparison of that service with the duties of love may remind the reader of Ovid's militat omnis amans, and Horace's militavi non sine gloria, though the comparison is not there made in exactly the same sense as here.
1029.
Διομήδεια]
"Ort Διομήδης ό Θρὰ̣, Scholiast.
The expression " Diomedeian necessity," whatever its origin, passed into the proverbial phraseology of the Greeks, and is frequently found in their writings.
We know that all Praxagora's communistic system is a caricature of Plato's theories in the Republic;
and it is possible that the phrase may at this moment have been specially brought to the poet's notice, by its occurrence in that remarkable passage in the sixth book, wherein Socrates is made to define the objects and the teaching of the sophists.
YOUTH.
I'll sham a merchant.
HAG.
You'll repent it then.
YOUTH.
And must I come?
HAG.
You must.
YOUTH.
Is it a stern Necessity ?
HAG.
Yes, quite Diomedéan.
YOUTH.
Then strew the couch with dittany, and set Four well-crushed branches of the vine beneath;
Bind on the fillets;
set the oil beside;
And at the entrance set the water-crock.
HAG.
Now, by my troth, you'll buy me a garland yet.
YOUTH.
A waxen garland.
So, by Zeus, I will.
You'll fall to pieces, I expect, in there.1030.
ύποστόρεσαι]
Then prepare a couch, cries the youth, but under the pretence of describing a nuptial bed, he is really describing a funeral bier.
We may gather from the present pas­ sage that the bier was strewn with ὀρίγανον (that species of marjoram which we know by the name of dittany, Frogs 603), and crushed branches of the vine.
Of the wreathes or fillets which were to be about the corpse, and the bottles of oil which were to be placed by its side, we have already heard, supra 538, &c. ταινίωσαι· στεφάνωσαι ὠς οἱ νεκροί. —Scholiast.
And a waterpot, called ἀρδάνιον, was placed at the house door, that visitors might purify themselves as they passed out.
Kuster refers to Pollux, viii. segm. 65, καὶ ol ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκίαν αλεȋτο ἀρδάνιον.

see for example the trick played by Ptolemy Philopator on the philosopher Sphaerus with wax fruits (Diog. Laert.
Book vii. Sphaerus) or birds (Athenaeus, viii. 50);
and waxen wreaths are mentioned in a pas­ sage of Artemidorus (Oneir. i. 77) cited by Dr. Blaydes στέφανοι κήριιοι πα̑σι κακοὶ, μάλιστα δὲ νοσου̑σιν, ἐπεὶ xat τὸν θάνατον κη̑ρα καλου̑σιν οἱ ποιηταί.

Just as the young couple are walking off in triumph, the door on the other side of the house of Blepyrus opens, and their hopes are dashed to the ground by the appearance of another Hag.
This second Hag is a mere legalist.
She displays neither the amatory propensities of the first, nor the fiery eagerness of the third.
With her the whole transaction is a matter of legal business.
“You are trans­ gressing the law,” she says to the girl:
" ”Tis the late drags you, not I" ;
“ Obey the late, and follow me," she says to the youth.
This characteristic runs through all her remarks.
Nor has she anyGIRL.
Where drag you him ?
HAG.
I'm taking home my husband.
GIRL.
Not wisely then :
the lad is far too young
To serve your turn.
You're of an age, methinks
To be his mother rather than his wife.

Out of sheer envy, but I'll pay you out.

fOdrO γὰρ ἐκείνου]
In the cor­ responding line, infra 1070, we read TOUT' αὐπολὺ τούτου τὸ κακὸν ἐξωλέστερον.
It is ἐκείνου here, because the first hag has disappeared;
it is τούτου there, because the second and third are both present, and the youth points to this and to that.
The αὐ in the later verse refers of course to the speaker's earlier experience here.1055.

This is not an uncommon way of putting the matter.

In Plato's Apology, chap. 28, Socrates, having been found guilty, and being entitled to propose an alternative penalty to the death-punishment de­ manded by his accusers, says that, contrary to his own inclinations, " Plato here and Crito, and Critobulus and Apollodorus tell him to propose a penalty of thirty minas, and that they will be his sureties;

and though she cannot effect that purpose, she sticks to him like a limpet, and continues gamely to pull and drag and vociferate, until they both, the youth and herself, are haled together into the second woman's house.
From the moment sibe appears up to the close of the scene, there is nothing but one unintermitted struggle over the body of the youth.

Now he suddenly discovers what she is, and calls for help to Heracles, the Destroyer of Monsters, and to Castor and Polydeuces, the great twin brethren, the helpers of men in peril and distress.
With these he apostrophizes the Pans and the Corybants, as the authors of those panic fears and frenzies with which his mind is at present distracted.1073.
παρὰ πῶν πλειόνων] Παρὰ τῶν τεκρῶν.— Scholiast.

We ourselves frequently speak of a deceased person as having gone over to, or joined, the majority.
But the phrase ispre-eminently a Greek one.
Pausanias (Attica, i. 43) tells us that the Megarians sent an em-bassy to Delphi to inquire how they might best ensure the prosperity of their city;
and the god replied Μεγαρέας ευ̉
The Megarians therefore, του̃το TO ἕπος it τοὺς τεθνεῶτας ἕχειν νομίζοντες, built their council-chamber so as to include within its precincts τὸν τάφον τῶν ἡρώων.
Polybius (viii. 30) gives a very similar account of the reasons which caused the Tarentines to make their cemeteries within the walls of their city, an oracle having declared ἅμεινον καὶ λώἵον ἕσεθαί πλεόνων.
The expression ad plures in the Trinummus of Plautus (ii. 2. 14) is doubtless a mere translation of Phile­ mon's παρὰ τοὺς πλείονας.
In Alciphron, iii.
7, a parasite, whose wealthy patrons had plied him with wine and tit-bits till they had nearly killed him, writes to a friend, 'Ιατταταιὰξ, τίς δαίμων ἥ θεὸς ἀπὸμηχανη̑ς (deus ex machina) ἐρρύσατό με μελλοντα παρὰτοὺς πλείονας ἰέναι;

0 this is like Cannonus's decree,to expostulate in person with Plato for the treatment he had accorded them in the Gorgias.
The expostulation being finished, the orator proceeds, ταυ̃τ' εἰπόν­ ἕγωγε οὐκ οι̉ματ.—iii 392 (ed. Canter).
Cf. Canter, Nov. Lect. iT. 18. The phrase, which did not find favour with Anacharsis the Scythian (Diog. Laert. in vita), or with the Indian gymno­ sophists (Plutarch, Alexander, chap. 64), occurs twice in the Greek Anthology;
Crinagoras, Epigram SO;
Leonidas of Tarentum, Epigram 79.
Most of the foregoing passages have been already mentioned by preceding editors, from be Fevre and Kuster downward.1086. πορθμη̃ς]
Were you to become ferrymen.
He is alluding, the Scholiast tells us, to the rough competition of the rival ferrymen, each striving to secure the passenger for his own boat;
ἐπειδὴ1089.
Καννώνου]
The youth, fettered on each side by the clutch of a resolute Bag, likens himself to a prisoner on his trial, under the provisions of the pse­ phism of Cannonus, for wrong done to the Athenian people.- See Bishop Thirl­ wall's note to chap.
80 of his History of Greece.
The substance, if not the very language of the psephism, is given us by Xenophon (Hellenics, i. 7. 21).
The psephism of Cannonus, he represents Euryptolemus as saying, enacts that if any one shall wrong the people of Athens, he shall make his defence beforethe people in filters.
And if he shall be found guilty, he shall be put to death and thrown into the Deadman's Pit:
and his goods shall be forfeited to the state, and the tithe thereof shall belong to the goddess.
The distinctive feature of the Decree of Cannonus, and the point in which it resembled the youth's case, was that the prisoner was to plead in fetters.
In like manner Hesychius, s. v. Καννόιου says, εἰσαγγελίαν κρινόμενον.
This is all that the ancient authorities tell us about the Decree of Cannonus.1090.
διαλελημμένον] Μέσον εἰλημμένον. —Scholiast.
Cf. Knights 262.
And this is a very common meaning of the word.
Le Fevre translates hinc illinc prehensum;
Brunck diremtum ;
but I am convinced that the former is the true .
interpretation here.
The prisoner was brought forward in chains, and was probably supported by, if not actually bound to, a jailer on each side.
But Brunck started a novel theory about the psephism of Cannonus, which, it must be admitted, has found some very distinguished supporters, including Mr. Grote in the sixty-fourth chapter of his History.
In the speech, to which refer­ ence is made in the preceding note, Eury­ ptolemus is earnestly pleading that a separate trial should be accorded to each of the accused general;
but well knowing that he must not altogether run counter to the popular feeling, he proposes that these separate trials should be conducted under the severest conditions, either under the provisions of the psephism of Cannonus (which he describes in the terms already given), or under the law against sacrilege and high treason (crimes of which they were not even accused).
And the resolution which he ultimately proposed took the following shape, That each general should have a separate trial, conducted under the provisions of the psephism of Cannonus, κατὰ τό Καννώνου Brunck, laying hold of these words, and apparently having entirely overlooked the account which the speaker had already given of the psephism in ques­ tion, concludes that instead of being, as all the authorities describe it, a severe and rigorous measure against a prisoner,To play the lover, fettered right and left.

0 yes, by Hecate, will yon, nill you, sir.it was really his Magna Charta, ensuring him a separate trial
And he explains the followingpassage as follows:
- Juxta Cannoni decreturn ait adolescens sibi impositam esse necessitatem δίχαέκάσυην, non κίνειν judicare, Bed βινεῖν permolere.
Jocas in eo consistit.
quod quum in de­ creto esset reos διειλημμένους ἀπολογεῖσθαι, seorsum causam dicere, adolescens dicat se διαλελημένον tanquam in direrea di­ ductum binis vetulis simul morigera­ turum.”
Mr. Grote, avoiding the con­ fusion of thought involved in this explanation, observes, ..
The young man does not compare his situation with that ofthe culprit, but with that of the dikastery which tried culprita.
The psephism of Kannonus directed that each defendant should be tried separately;
accordingly if it happened that two defendants were presented for trial, and were both to be tried without a moment's delay, the dikastery could only effect this object by dividing itself into two halves or portions.
By doing this (κρίνειν ὀιαλε­ λημμένον) it could try both the defendunts at once;
but in no other way.
Now the young man in Aristophanes compares himself to the dikastery thus circum­ stanced;
which comparison is signified by the pun of βινεῖν διαλελημμέτον in place of κρίνειν διαλελημμένον."
This amendment of Brunck's explanation, though clear and coherent in itself, shocks all one's notions, not only of Aristophanic humour, but also of dicastic usages.
A dicastery had no power to subdivide itself in the way suggested;
there were dicasteries enough to give a separate and simultaneous trial not only to two, but to ten defendants;
whilst, as regards the proposal of Euryptolemus.
it is clear that he intended the trials to be not simultaneous, but successive.
so that the popular fury might have time to calm down ;
he even suggests which prisoner shall stand his trial first.
There is no ground for supposing a pun between κρίνειν and βνεῖν.
There is no such phrase known as κρίνειν διολελημ­ μένον.
And the youth's βινεῑν διαλελημ­ μένον is intended to answer to the words ἀποὀικεῑν δεδεμέιον which are found in the psephism of Cannonus.1092.
βολϑῶν] 'Επιτήδειοι γὰρ πρὸς συνουσίαν οἱ βολβοί.—Scholiast.
Bergler refers to Athenaeus, ii.chaps.. 64 and 65.
where many passages are cited, showing that βολβοὶ were considered διερτικοὶ ἀφροδιισίων.
And see also Ath. i. 8.1101. Φρύνην]
Φρύνη, which properly means a toad, was a nickname commonly given to courtezans at Athens, possibly from the unnatural brilliance of their eyes.
The Phryne, of whose beauty so many anecdotes are told, belonged of course to a later period.
The words which follow, ἅχουσαν λήκυθ
ον, πρὸς ταῖς γνάθοις, are plainly a continuation of the grim joke which pervades the scene, that the Hag resembles a corpse with her funeral bottle beside her.
It is impossible to accept the Scholiast's explanation ϕ̀’ηκυῖαν, meaning that the Hag's cheeks were swoln like a bottle . of oil.
1104.
συνείρξομαι]
Shall be shut up with, as bride and bridegroom.
In the fifth book of Plato's Republic, to which such constant reference is made in this play, we find the active of this verb used in the sense of "bringing together" a bride and bridegroom;
μὴ ξυνέρξαντ
ος ἄρχοντος, when the Archon has not shut them up together as a wedded pair, chap.
9. Dr. Blaydes refers to Plutarch (Alexander, chap. 2) who, speaking of the marriage of Philip and Olympian, says, ἠ μὲν οὐν νύμφη πμὸ τῆς νυκτὸς, ἵ/ συνείρχθησαν εἰς τὸν θάλαμον, κ.τ.λ., and many other passages.1105.
πολλὰ πολλὰκις]
The reduplica­ tion of πολλὰ increases the emphasis of the phrase, expressing the speaker's conviction that the dreaded event will in all probability occur.
ἐὰν πολλὰκις is merely equivalent to if (which is possible), supra 791.
ἐὰν πολλὰ πολλὰκις means if (which is probable).
On the use of ἐὰν τι πὰθω, if anything happens to me, in the sense of if I should die, see Peace 169;

It would seem that as they go tumbling into the second Hag's house, the youth is sandwiched between the two;
one of whom is κάτω, pulling him in, and the other ἄνω, trying to drag him back.
The one who is κάτω will, as Dr. Blaydes suggests, fall to pieces (διαπσείται, supra 1086);
and so will apparently form the young man's grave.
The one who is ἄνω will survive, but she is to be blackened with pitch, and fixed to the place with molten lead, so as to represent (πρό­ φασιν) one of the funeral λήκυθ
οι.
The youth and his tormentors now disappear from sight;
the scene of the Three Hags is finished;
and we pass into a lighter and pleasanter atmosphere.
1112.
ΘΕΡΑΠΑΙΝΑ]
A waiting-maid of Praxagora enters, with a commission from her mistress to fetch Blepyrus and the children, and bring them down to the public banquet.
In former times it would have been the husband who sent the maid to fetch his wife and children:
but we have changed all that.
The wife is now the head of the house, and it is she who sends the maid to fetch her husband and children.
The waiting-maid calls her mistress μακαριω­ τάτην, because she not only has, like all other wives, assumed the awful rule and right supremacy which formerly belonged to the husband, but has in addition been recognized as the chief­ tainess of the New Republic, which she had so large a part in establishing.1114.
έπὶ ταῖσω θύραις]
That is, the door of Blepyrus's house, the scene having remained unchanged throughout the play.
She goes on to laud her own happiness once more, the fragrance of the Thasian wine being obviously still potent in her brain.1118.
πολὺ δ' ὑπερπέπαικεν]
So the old woman in the Curculio of Plautus (i. 2. 5, to which Brunck also refers), ad­ dressing a flagon of fragrant old wine, exclaims, " Omnium unguentum odor, prae tuo, nautea est."1119. Θύσι' ἀμφορείδια
Of all the unguents with which the outside of her head was perfumed, none was so fragrant as the Thasian wine which had got inside her head.
The Thasian wine was famous for its bouquet, and when it was bottled in these earthen flagons, the vintners were accustomed to put in it wheaten dough (σταῖς) steeped in honey, ῶστε Tit, ὀσμὴν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ, τὴν δὶ γλυκύτητα ἀπὸ τοῦ σταιὸς λαμ ϐάνειν τὸν οἴνον.
See Athenaeus, i. chap. 58, and Theophrastus de Odoribus there quoted.
Aristophanes mentions the Thasian wine in the Lysistrata and in the Plutus, and in each place refers to its delightful fragrance.
Many passages relating to it are collected from the poets in Athenaeus, i. chapters 51-53.
In the latter chapter he cites some hexameters of Hermippus, describing the various kinds of wine:
and of the Thasian he says:
A sweet apple-fragrance so mellow, Has the flagons of Thaws invaded, That the Thasian has hardly its fellow, 'Tis the best of all wines, I'm persuaded, Excepting the rival-defying, The faultless, the exquisite Chian.
And 0 my mistress, luckiest of us all, And ye who now are standing at our door, And all our neighbours, aye and all our town, And I'm a lucky waiting-maid, who now Have had my head with unguents rich and rare Perfumed and bathed ;
but far surpassing all Are those sweet flagons full of Thasian wine.
Their fragrance long keeps lingering in the head, Whilst all the rest evaporate and fade.
There's nothing half so good;
great gods, not half!
Choose the most fragrant, mix it neat and raw,(ἄλυπον leaving no headache after it, cf. Eur. Bacch. 423).
The last two lines are a parody of a favourite couplet of Homer, who says that Nireus was the fairest (II.
ii. 674) and Aias the shape­ liest and mightiest (II. xvii. 280;
Od. xi. 469 and 550;
xxiv. 18), τῶν ἄλλων Δαναῶν, μετ'ἀμύμονα Πηλείωνα.
The Thasian and the Chian are frequently bracketed together as the noblest wines of Hellas;
and though in the days of Horace the Chian seems to have main­ tained an absolute supremacy, yet in softer and more luxurious times, the sweet-tasted and sweet-scented Thasian was at least an equal favourite.
"Ye drink your Thasian wine," says St. Chrysostom to the wealthy members of his congregation (Hom. 48 in Matth.
501 B), "Ye drink your Thasian wine, and will not give even a cup of cold water to the Lord who gave you all," that is, to the poor of Christ.
And in the fifty-third Homily 544 A, he uses the expression οί TOP Θάσιον οίνον πίνον­ τες to describe the rich and luxurious classes in contrast with the poor labourer who drinks the water from the crystal spring.
St. Clement of Alexandria in his Paedagogus, ii. 30, running through the principal Hellenic wines, and ap­ propriating to each its special attribute, gives to the Thasian the epithet ό εὺώδης.1123.
κέρασον ἄκρατον]
These words are of course in direct contradiction to each other.
The speaker was expected to say, " Mix it in the proportion of 3 (water) to 1 (wine) or in the propor­ tion of 2 to 1, or 1 to 1 (ἴσον ἴσω̩)," or otherwise as her taste might suggest.
But instead of this she adds παρὰ π poo­ δοκίαν, the word ἄκρατον;
that is.
in the proportion of 0 to 1:
or in other words, don't mix it at all.
It is the joke which Aristophanes was so fond of making upon the (alleged) bibulous propensities of Athenian women.
With the actual words used may be compared the κεκερασμένου ἀκράτου of the Apoca­ lypse, xiv. 10.1126.
τὸν ἄνὸρα]
The Man is now a secondary personage, to be described by his relationship to the real head of the house.
It was part of the humiliation of King Lear to be styled " my Lady's Father."
κεκτημέν
ος is the regular appellation of a slave's owner.
See Plutus 4.1127. αὐτοὒ μένουσ']
The line would seem to be a quotation from some tragic poet.
It is hardly spoken when the door of the central house is opened.
.and Blepyrus comes out with some little girls, the children of himself and Praxagora.1182.
πλεῖον ἢ τρισμυρίων]
See the note on Wasps 707.
The 20,000 men­ tioned there are the poorer citizens who are to be recipients of the state's bounty.
Here he is reckoning up the entire number of Athenian citizens (for there is no distinction now between rich and poor), and agrees in his computation with Hdt. v. 97 and Plato, Symposium, chap. 3;
Axiochus 369 A.1133.
οὐ δεδείπνηκας μόνος]
These words are probably intended to be taken παρ' ὑπόνοιαν, as the Scholiast says, and as in the following line the Chorus appear to take them.
Yet they are no doubt susceptible of another interpretation, viz. that Blepyrus is happy in still having his dinner to enjoy, whilst the other citizens have nearly finished theirs.
'
Twill make us merry all the whole night through.
But tell me, ladies, where my master is;
I mean, the husband of my honoured mistress.
CHOP.
If you stay here, methinks you'll find him soon.
MAID.
Aye, here he comes.
He's off to join the dinner.
O master, 0 you lucky, lucky man !
BLEP.

MAID.
Yes you, by Zeus, you luckiest man.
What greater bliss than yours, who, out of more
Than thrice ten thousand citizens, alone, Have managed, you alone, to get no dinner ?

MAID.
Hi!

And much the last of all, by Aphrodite.
Well, well, my mistress bade me take you, sir, You and these little girls and bring you thither.
Aye, and there's store of Chian wine remaining, And other dainties too;
so don't delay.
says the Scholiast, and with him the Commentators agree.
But this is to destroy all the pleasantry of the passage.
The μείραες are the little daughters of Blepyrus and Praxagora, who have just come on the stage with their father.
See the notes on 1112 and 1127 supra.
The women who form the Chorus were contemporaries of Praxagora, and, as we know from the entrance scene, were actually married women, who could in no sense be called μείρακες.
And see infra 1151, 2.1139.
Χῖος]
We have seen in the note on 1119 supra that the Chian was deemed the " peerless Achilles" of wines.
And in fact it was the choicest and most expensive of the old Hellenic wines, the drink of the wealthiest citizens, just as the Coan was the worst and cheapest, the drink of the agricultural labourer (Demosthenes, v. Lacritum 39).
The Chian stood at the head, and the Coan at the foot, of the list of Hellenic wines.
And hence it probably was, that dicers, playing in their wine-parties, gave the name of Χῖος to the highest, and Κῳ̄ος to the lowest, throw of the dice. " The ancient medals of Chios," says Dr. Clarke (Travels, iii. 192)," all have reference to the Chian wine, which still maintains its pristine celebrity."
And almost all the ancient Chian coins in the British Museum bear, amongst other emblems, the figure of a wine-jar set underneath a cluster of grapes.1144.
οὔκουν]
Blepyrus, amazed at the magnificent invitation which his waiting-maid issues, ironically proposes to make it still more magnificent.
..
There is no end, no measure, limit, bound," to his invitation.
Had you not better, he says, bid all the spectators come, and not only such of them as are well-disposed ?
and all the judges, and not merely those who look kindly on our play ?
At the same time he intimates that they will get nothing if they do come:
if they really want a dinner, they had better depart each to his own home.
The imaginary character of the proffered feast is several times intimated in these closing lines.
Observe that in his in­ vitation to all the spectators he enumer­ ates merely boys and men of different ages;
he makes no allusion to women.
The question whether women formed part of the audience is discussed in the Introduction to this play.1150.
δᾷδα ταυτηνι]
This is perhaps the torch which the youth was carrying on his first appearance.
See the note on 934 supra.1153.
μέλος μελλοδειπνικόν]
A play on the words is, of course, intended.
Aelian (V. H. viii.
7) calls the "Song before meals" a μέλος συγκλητικόν.
At the wedding-banquet of Alexanderthe Great, he says, one μέλος was sung to summon the guests to the banquet, and another to dismiss them when it was over.
τὸ κλητιὸν, ὄτε ἐσήμαινον ἀπαλλάσσεσθαι.
In the preceding line, as elsewhere, κατα­ βαίνειν is employed in reference to the simple action of leaving the stage.
1154.
rots κριταῖσι]
The Chorus appeal to the theatrical judges, in the character, not of Praxagora's friends, but of theAnd all the audience who are well disposed, And every judge who looks not otherwards, Come on with us;
we'll freely give you all.
BLEP.
Nay, no exceptions;
open wide your mouth, Invite them all in free and generous style, Boy, stripling, grandsire;
yea announce that all Shall find a table all prepared and spread For their enjoyment, in — their own sweet homes.
But I !
I'll hurry off to join the feast, And here at least I've got a torch all handy.
CHOR.
Then why so long keep lingering here, nor take
These little ladies down ?
And as you go, I'll sing a song, a Lay of Lay-the-dinner.
But first, a slight suggestion to the judges.
Aristophanic choreutae, or, in other words, their remarks aie παραβατικά.
That the κριταὶ, in comedy at all events, were five in number is plain upon all the authorities.
Most of them are cited and discussed in Hermann's little treatise, De Quinque judicibus Poetarum (Opuscula, vii. 88).
Thus Hesychius says, πέντε κριταί· τοσοῦτοι τοῖς Κωμικοῖς ἔκρινον, οὐ μόνον Ἀθήνησιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν Σικελίᾳ.
And Photius, πέντε κριταί· οί Tol, Κωμῳδοῖς ἀποδεικνί μενοι.
And the Scholiast on Birds 445, ἔκρινον έ κριταὶ τοὺς Κωικούς· οί δὲ λαμβάνοντες τὰς έ ψήφους εὐδαιμόνουν (έ κριταὶ is Hermann's emendation for οἱ κριταὶ, and its correctness is shown by the subsequent τὰς έψήφους).
The spectators might applaud or hiss, and the judges would no doubt be swayed, and to some extent rightly so, by the reception which a comedy experienced from the assembled people;
but still the ultimate decision rested entirely with the κριταὶ themselves, whether they were the five judges of Athenian comedy, or the more or less numerous judges who might be the umpires in other contests.
Καὶ γὰρ οὖν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἦ ὄσοι δή.
—Lucian, Harmonides, chap.
2.
And hence arose a proverbial expression which Hermann thinks was originally an anapaestic of Epicharmus, ἐν πέντε κριτῶν γούνασι κεῖται, an imitation of the Homeric phrase, θεῶν ἐν γοίνασι κεῖται.
Yet verily all these things on the knees of the high gods lie.
Let Zeus take thought for the issue, but hurl at the foe will I. (WAY, Iliad, :
vii. 514.)ἐν πέντε κριτῶν γούνασι κεῖται. τὸ παλαιὸν πέντε κριταὶ ἔκρινον τοὺς Κωμικούς.—Pro­ verbia Alexandrinorum, 76 (in Plutarch's works).
ἐν πέντε κριτῶν· ἐν ἀλλοτρίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ἐστίν.
πἐντε δὲ κριταὶ τοὺς Κωμι­ κοὺς ἔκρινον.―Hesychius. ἐν πέντε κριτῶν θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κείται.―Zenobius, Provo iii. 64. Suidas.
It is obvious that this address to the judges could have formed no part of the original play.
It could not have been inserted until the play had been not only accepted, but also allotted the first place in the order of performance.1155.
τοίς σοφοῖς]
We know that Aristophanes always claimed the σοφοὐς and δεξιοὺς amongst the audience as his unwavering supporters;
see the note on Wasps 1047.
But here the word σοφοὶ has probably a somewhat more specific meaning.
The play is a compound of philosophic theory and broad farce.
And by σοφοὶ he probably means the philosophic theorists from whom be has borrowed the idea of his eommunistic legislation.
However, according to Plutarch's (if it be Plutarch's) uncritical " Comparison of Aristophanes and Men­ ander," such an appeal as this would meet with no response from any quarter;
for, says that writer, Aristophanes was οὔτε τοῖς πολλοῖς ἀρεστὀς, οὔτε τοῖς φρον­ ίμοις ἀνεκτός.1160.
μἠ 'πιορκεῖν]
Pherecrates, an older contemporary of our poet, in a passage preserved by both Photius and Suidas, a. v. Φίλιος, addresses the judges in a very similar strain.
He has ap­ parently been bringing an accusation of unfairness against the judges in some earlier contest:
Let the wise and philosophic choose me for my wisdom's sake, Those who joy in mirth and laughter choose me for the jests I make;
Then with hardly an exception every vote I'm bound to win.
Let it nothing tell against me, that my play must first begin ;
See that, through the afterpieces, back to me your memory strays ;
Keep your oaths, and well and truly judge between the rival plays.
Be not like the wanton women, never mindful of the past, Always for the new admirer, always fondest of the last.
Now 'tis time, 'tis time, 'tis time,Now to you, the judges, I say, You who judge betwixt us to-day, Keep your oaths, be honest and true, Give to every poet his due.
Else, by Zeus, the lover of friends, (These the words Pherecrates sends), He'll, with chiding sterner than this, Pay you out for judging amiss.
Each line consists of a trochaic dipody, followed by a choriamb.
The judges were chosen, and the oath administered, in the full theatre, after the spectators bad taken their seats, and immediately before the commencement of the dram­ atic performances.
Plutarch tells us that when Sophocles first came forward as a competitor in the tragic contests, the excitement was so great, and the partisan spirit was running so high, that the Archon did not choose the judges by lot, κριτὰς μὲν οὐκ ἐκλήρωσε τοῦ ἀγῶνος, but detained Cimon and the other generals who were present to offer sacrifice and made them take the oath, and sit as judges;
and that, although they were ten in number, one from each tribe, οὐκ ἐφη̑κεν αὐτοὺς ἀπελ­ θεῖν, ἀλλ’ ὁρκώσας ὴνάγκασε καθίσαι καὶ κρῖναι δεκὰ ο̃ντας, ἀπὸ φυλη̑ς μιᾶς ε̃καστον (Cimon 8).
The last four words are apparently used by an oversight for ὰπὸ φυλη̑ς έκάστης ε̃να.
Demosthenes (Meidias 25), amongst other charges which he brings against Meidias, de­ clares that he endeavoured to corrupt the theatrical judges, standing by them, when they were taking the oath, ὀμνύουσι παρεστηκὼς τοῖς κριταῖς.
And of this, he says, all the δικασταὶ themselves, as part of the audience, were witnesses.
1162.
τελευταίων] " With all women," says Sir Charles Pomander, in Reade’s Peg Woffington, chap. 2, .. the present lover is an angel, and the past a demon, and so on in turn."1165.
Κρητικω̑ς]
This refers to the Cretan ὑπορχήματα, and it was not necessary for Yelsen to twist the words from καὶ τάαδε to ῥυθμὸν into Cretic feet.
Probably during the remainder of the play the Chorus are dancing the κόρδαξ.1166.
τοῖτο δρω̑]
From the words ἀκροασάμενος and λαβὼν, infra 1175, 6, we may conclude that Blepyrus was still on the stage (for if he were absent, there would be none but women there), and it seems, therefore, reasonable to suppose that these two words are spoken by him.
1169.
λοποδο- κ.τ.λ.]
My translation of this word (a word fit only for Gar. gantua's mouth), may, perhaps, be justi.
fled by a line in Adam Littleton's pro­ posed Latin inscription for the Monument of London, Fordo- Watermano-Hansono- Hookero - Vinero-Sheldono-Davisionam;
Ford, Waterman, Hanson, Hooker,Viner, Sheldon, and Davis, being the Lord Mayors, during whose successive mayoral­ ties the monument was in course of erec­ tion.
This is no doubt the word of which Eustathius speaks in his Commentary on Iliad, xxii. 427, to which Brunck calls ourattention.
“Homer,” says the learned Archbishop, " was not fond of long com­ pound words;
but later writers, and particularly Attic writers, employed them in great abundance.
More es­ pecially was their use elaborated with exceeding great pains in comedy.
In a little-read comedy of Aristophanes (παρὰ τῷ Κωμικῷ ε̃ν τινι ἀσυνήθει κωμῳεδίᾳ),Sisters dear, 'tis time for certain, if we mean the thing to do,To the public feast to hasten.

It may be likened to a πνῖγος after the Parabatic verses above.
It is, perhaps, not amen­ able to any strict metrical rules, but consists of a string of trisyllables, dactyls and tribrachs intermingled.
The system continues beyond the great word itself to the end of τρύβλιον ;
and indeed still further, if Aristophanes made the i in κόνισαι short.

An omelet.
They have been expatiating on the splendour of the banquet awaiting them, and urging their fellows to hasten to share its abundance;
but "take," they say, "a platter and an omelet ” (a cheap common article of food;
Lysistrata 5621, "in your hands, that you may have some­ thing to dine on";
meaning, we do not advise you to trust to our picture;

Then up with your feet and away to go.
Off, off to the supper we'll run.

Sir Walter Scott records a pleasantry of a somewhat similar character on the part of a Highland chieftain who, when his French allies, dismayed at the barren­ ness of the land, inquired at what season forage and other necessaries for cavalry were to be found in the High­ lands, replied, "At every season-if you bring them."1181.
ὡς ἐπὶ νίκη]
Aristophanes loves, as the play draws to a close, to indulge in notes of triumph and anticipations of victory.
These Bacchic cries (Evoi, Evae) do not merely celebrate the success of Praxagora's revolution, they also prognosticate the poet's own success over his theatrical rivals in the Bacchic contest.
There is a very similar passage in Lysistrata 1292-1294.THE
Ecclesiazusae is found, in whole or in part, in the following MSS.:
— R. The Ravenna MS. H. The Monaco (Herculis Portus) MS. (No. 137).
F. The first Florentine (No. 31, 15 in the Laurentian Library).
P. The first Parisian (No. 2712).
P1. The second Parisian (No. 2715).
Only R. and H. give the play in its entirety.
But F. and P1. omit only about fifty verses at the end, both terminating with line 1136.
P., in Brunck's time (A.D. 1783), contained the first 444 lines, but part of the MS.
has perished since then, and in Velsen's time (A.D. 1883) it went no further than line 282.
All these are collated by Velsen, whose diligence and accuracy as a collator are beyond all praise.
For the readings of P. between 282 and 444 we must rely upon Brunck, who did not profess to give a complete account of its variations.
Of these five MSS., R. H. and P. are far superior to the other two.
F. is full of obvious blunders, destructive alike of the sense and the metre.
The transcriber of Pl. or of the MS.
from which it was copied, seems to have had before him F. or a MS.
of the same type, and to have attempted, by emendations of his own, to restore both sense and metre.
Sometimes be hits upon the true reading, but far more fre­ quently he strays further from it than F. itself does.
The editions of Aristophanes in my possession are enumerated at the commencement of the Appendix to the Frogs.
With the exception of Xeobari (No. 6) all the first nineteen, from Aldus to Dindorf, contain the Ecclesiazusae.
After Dindorf's I have the following editions of the play:
- (19) Bothe.
Leipsic, 1845. (20) Bergk. Leipsic, 1857. (21) Meineke.
Leipsic, 1860. (22) Holden.
London, 1868. (23) Blaydes.
Halle, 1881. (24) Yelsen's Ecclesiazusae.
Leipsic, 1883.
It should be remembered that my account of the readings of the printed editions of Aristophanes is confined to those in my own posses­ sion.
Thus, if I say “All editions before Gelenius read so and so," I mean that all the editions in my possession do so.
If I say that such a word is read by Fracini, Grynaeus, Brunck, recentiores (I use “recen­ tiores" as if it were undeclinable), I mean that Fracini and Gelenius are the only editions in my possession before Brunck which so read, but that all the editions in my possession after Brunck do so.
I believe, however, that my list contains all the editions of any value.
I have taken one or two hints from an article in the Quarterly Review of October, 1884.
From Dr. Blaydes's critical notes on Frogs 76 and elsewhere I gather the Reviewer to have been his friend Arthur Palmer, the late eminent Professor of Latin in the University of Dublin, to whom indeed Dr. Blaydes dedicates his own edition of Aristophanes.
There being so much fewer MSS.
and editions of this play than of the Frogs, I have been able to give a more complete synopsis of the manu­ script readings, and to trace them more minutely through the printed editions;
though-even in the MSS.
it did not seem desirable to enumerate such matters as an erroneous accent or the omission of an iota sub­ scriptum, unless indeed the error or omission might conceivably point to some other reading;
whilst in the printed editions there are often obvious misprints, to record which would be merely to compile a list of If Errata."
In the present play too, the names of the speakers are, in the MSS., so often omitted, and the dialogue, both in the MSS.
and in the editions, is so variously distributed, that I have not, as a rule, thought it necessary to notice these minor points.2. κάλλιστ’ ἐν εὐσκόποισιν H. F. P. Pl. Aldus and all editions down to Meineke;
though Le Fevre had suggested εὐσκό­ τοισιν, which Bentley justly condemned.
κάλλιστ’ ἐν εὐστόχοισιν R. Meineke, Holden. κάλλιστον εὐστόχοισιν Velsen.
The last word in the line is in all the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck (and Bekker afterwards) written ἐξητη­ μένον.
Scaliger suggested ἐξησκημένον.
Dobree suggests that the Scholiast read ἐζητημένον, which is adopted, as the true reading of the text, by Holden and Velsen, but can hardly mean excogitatum.
ἐξηρτημένον Paulmier, Bentley, Jens, Brunck, Invernizzi, Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk. ίξηυρημένον Meineke.
For the last three words of the line Blaydes substitutes τοῖς σοφοῖσιν ἐξηυρημένον from the Scholiast's gloss ἡ ε̃ννοια, καλλιστα
Tins σοφοῖς εὑρημένον, κ.τ.λ.
But if the Scholiast had read τοῖς σοφοῖσιν ἐξηυρη­ μένον, he.
could not possibly have said that the ε̃ννοια (the meaning) of the words was τοῖς σοφοῖς εὑρημένον, so explaining idem per idem.
And indeed it seems pretty clear that the Scholiast is really explaining εὐσκόποισιν.
Moreover line 6 seems to show that the lamp was placed in some conspicuous position, as the signal to which the women were to gather.
And while the expression γονἀς in the succeeding line is satisfied by the τροχηλάτου of line 1, there is nothing to which the expression rvxar can answer unless we read έν εὐσκόποισιν ἐξηρτημένον here.
There is not much force in Meineke's objection, “Suspensae lucemae nullum in sequentibus indi­ cium" (Vind. Aristoph.).
The lamp was certainly somewhere, and wherever it was, there is no mention of it " in sequentibus.
"4. ῦπο is the suggestion of Kuster, approved by Bergk, and adopted by Blaydes and Velsen.

In the preceding line Junta and one or two other editions have τρόπῳ for τρόπων.10.
λορδουμένων MSS.
Brunck, recen­ tiores.
χορδουμένων editions before Brunck, many of which also omit the τε which follows.
But λομδουμένων is read by Suidas s. v.;
and before it was known to be the MS.
reading had been approved by Bisetus, Scaliger, Bentley, Hunter, and Bergler.—ἐπισάτην MSS.

"Dedi ἐπίσκοπον quod multo aptius est”-Blaydes.16. συνδρῶν MSS. vulgo.
συνορῶν Meineke, Holden, " qui enim to says the former (Vind. Aristoph),” facinoris socios se faciunt, ii profecto non verendum at quae cum aliis fecerunt palam faciant, siquidem ipsicriminis reitenentur."
But the lamp was in fact an active partici­ pator in, and not a mere spectator of, these goings on;
the συν in συνομῶν would be meaningless;
and λαλεῖς τοῖς πλησίον is to be understood not of betraying a crime, but of gossiping over household secrets with the neighbours.
20.
πρὸς ὄρθρον γ’ R. H. F. P. vulgo.
πρὸς ὄρθρον P1. Brunck.—ἐστίν.
ἠ δὲ.
So the line is read and divided in the MSS.
and by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
All editions before Brunck had in one sentence καίτοι πρὸς ὄρθρον y' ἐστὶν ἤδ’ ἐκκλησία, generally followed by a full stop.
Then the next line was also one undivided sentence, αὐτίκα μάλ’ ἔσται καταλαβεῖν ἠμᾶς ἔδρας, it will speedily be time for us to take our seats.
And H. too omits the δ’ after καταλαβεῖν.
But otherwise all the MSS.
and Brunck and all subsequent editors read and divide the line as in the text.
22. φυρόμαχός R. Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
Σφυρόμαχός H. F. P. P1. vulgo.
Phyromachus is several times found as a proper name;
Sphyromachus never.
Brunck commences the line with ὠς instead of of.23.
έταίρας MSS.
and all editions before Dindorf, except Junta and Gor­ mont who have έτέρας, obviously a mere copyist's error, since it ruins the metre, neither Junta nor Gormont, nor any other editor before Dindorf, introducing into the line the particle πως.
The MSS.
however have πως though they do not know where to locate it, R. and H. placing it before, and F. P. and P1. after, the participle.
It is, as Meineke admits, " perquam incommoda," and is probably interpolated from some gloss, perhaps from the very scholium cited in the first note in the commentary.
Nevertheless Dindorf introduces it into the text, though in order to make the line scan, he is obliged to resort to the old error of Junta and Gormont, and to substitute έτέρας πως (which is read by no MS. or edition) for the έταίρας of the MSS.
and (save as aforesaid) all the editions.
And he is followed by all subsequent editors, who generally con­ nect έτέρας with ἔδρας the other seats (Meineke ubi supra), which I confess seems to me perilously like nonsense.
Velsen reads τὰς δ’ έτέρας, as if the speaker and her friends were to take the seats assigned them by Phyromachus, and the other women to sit where they could, out of sight.
All these diffi­ culties are avoided if we retain the genuine reading ἑταίρας.
About the participle which follows there is, as it.
seems to me, much more room for doubt.
H. and all the editions before Brunck have κἀγαθιζομένας.
And this is to some extent approved by Bentley who refers to the explanations given by Hesychius and the Etymol.
Magn. of ἀγαθιζομένη.
viz. ἀγαθὰλέγουσαand συνχῶςἀγαθὰ λέγουσα
And if the passage is cited from Agathon, the employment of ἀγα­ θιζεσθαιfor εὐφηυεῖνιs just one of the little conceits which we should expect in his language.
Bentley however him­ self suggested κἀγκαθιζομένας, and this, or the cognate form κἀγκαθεζομένας,is adopted by Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes.
Scaliger had previously proposed ἐγκαθιζομένας, which is followed by Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, and Velsen.
I confess to a strong leaning towards κἀγαθιζομένας, but the word is not found elsewhere, Bentley's alteration is very slight, and seems strongly supported by the scho­ lium above referred to, and by the Scholiast on this verse, and I have therefore adopted it.
Another suggest tion by Bentley was δεῖνfor δεῖ,but this was on the old reading in which καταλαβεῖνwas governed by έσται.
See on 20 supra.
The other MS.
readings are κωλαθιζομέναςR., καθαγιαζομένας F. P. P1.24-26.
τίδῆτ...λαθεῖν.
These three lines are omitted by F. P. P1., the tran­ scriber's eye having passed from the final λαθιῖνοf line 23 to the final λαθεῖν of line 26.
Brunck indeed changes, from his own conjecture, the second λαθεῖνιnto λαβεῖνand is followed by Invernizzi, Dindorf, and Bothe.
But there is no ground for this alteration.25.
τοὺςπώγωναςΗ. vulgo.
τὰςπώ­ γώναοςR. though it retains the ούς which immediately follows.
29. τυγχάνῃ.
So all the editions, and so (except that it omits the iota sub­ script) P1. τυγχάνειςR. H. F. P.So. ΓυνὴΑ.
It is not easy to say how many women take part in the ensuing conversation, or in what manner they should be described.
The MSS.
give us but little assistance.
R. F. P1. gene­ rally omit, the speaker's name alto­ gether, whilst H. and P. have simply γυνήΤΙS, or something equally indefinite.
The editions before Brunck merely indicated the speakers with the exception of Praxagora by γυ., and when two women speak consecutively, introduced the second as έτ. or ᾰλλ’.
Brunck dis­ tinguishes nine women, other than Praxagora, calling them γυ.a:
yv. :
and so on down to γυ.
ί.This was followed by Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, and Bothe.
Bergk rightly reduced the speakers to four:
calling them Praxa­ gora, two women, and the Chorus.
And so, in substance, Meineke, Holden, and Velsen.
Blaydes, omitting the Chorus, reduced them to three:
making the second woman give one account of her­ self in 37-40, and a totally different account in 54-56.
This seems an im­ possible arrangement.
The latter lines are obviously spoken by a woman who has just hurried breathlessly in.
Bergk gives to the Chorus the present speech 30, 31, and 42-45 infra.
The reasons for my own arrangement will be found in the commentary.32. δέ γ’ύμᾶςR. H. P'. vulgo. δ’ ύμᾶς F. P.—ἐγρηγόρεινR. H. P. F. Invemizzi, Bekker, Bergk.

ἐγρηγόρη Dindorf, Bothe, Meineke, Holden, and Velsen.

The deter­ mination to eradicate -ειν, however strongly supported by the MSS., is due to the statement found in the grammarians that the termination -ηιs Attic, and -ειν Hellenic:
as for example Moeris ᾔδη, Ἀττικω̑ς.
Ἑλληνικῶς.
But I have already had occasion to point out (in Appendix to Frogs 819) that "Hellenic" does not mean "un-Attic," and Pierson in his note on Moeris, ubi supra, shows that the termination -εινιs in some places required by the metre.
See infra 650.34.

These are all variations of the same word.40. λαβεῖν.
So every edition except Velsen's.
All the MSS.

Blaydes approves, and Velsen reads, ’λαβον.42. παροῦσανΜSS.
Invernizzi.
παρ­ ιοῦσανDindorf, Bergk, Holden, Velsen. προσιοῦσανevery other edition.
παρι­ oīσανwas introduced by Dindorf under the mistaken notion that it was the reading in R.:
and no doubt Bergk and Holden adopted it in the same belief.
Velsen was aware that R. read παροῦοαν, but says " παριοῦσανnescio quis primo­ rum editorum."
This however is another mistake:
it was nowhere read before Dindorf.
In itself it seems a probable reading, this being the πάροδ
οςοf the First Semichorus, and the word being easily corrupted into παροῦσαν, but it is entirely destitute of authority.
Προσ­ ιοῦσανιs obviously merely adopted from the προσιόντων, προσιούσας, &c., of the context.45.
ἠμῶν.
These three lines are at­ tributed to Praxagora by H. and P., and the editors generally.
This made ἡμῶνιncomprehensible, since Praxagora was not herself one of the women hastening to the signal lamp.
Meineke therefore proposed to change ἡμῶνιnto ἠ μὴν, and Holden so reads;
whilst Velsen would change it into ήμν.
But when it is perceived that these are the words of the Coryphaeus, ἡμῶνιs as natural here as ήμῖνιn the corresponding exhortation, Wasps 242.

The MSS.
and the editions before Bekker have ἀνὴρ, though R. (and R. alone) recognizes the aspirate by reading όπόθ’ instead of ὁπότ’.
In the same note Dawes proposes forἐχλιαινόμην(MSS. vulgo) ἐχλιανόμην;
and so Porson in his Adversaria, observing that the first syllable of χλιαίνωιs long in Lysistrata 386.
I have followed these authorities, though I believe the first syllable of χλιαίνω,as of χλιαρὸς, to be common.
Bergk changed ἐχλιαινόμηνιnto ἐχραι­ νόμηνciting Bekker's Anecd. L 72. 28 'χραίνεθαιπρὸςἤλι
ον’τὸλεγόμενονίπὸ τῶν πολλῶνἐπικαίειν(ἐπικαίεσθαι, Meineke) τῶ̩ἡλίω̩.
And this is followed by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.
Meineke in his Vind.
Aristoph.
says that he himself had originally con­ jectured ἐμελαινόμην,and refers to Galen vol. vi. p. 47 ἐξἡλίουμελανότης, ἐκ μακρᾶςσκιατροφίαςλευκότης.
And whether we read ἐχλιανόμηνἐχραινόμηνοr ἐμελαι­ νόμην,this of course was the object of the women in exposing themselves to the sun, though the object seems to have been very imperfectly attained.

Dindorf's excellent emendation admits of no doubt, and it is very prob­ able, as Blaydes suggests, that the MS.
errors arise from the fact that the ἀλιn ἀλλὰwas attracted to the prefix rYNH as if the meaning were γυνὴἄλλη.
Throughout this opening scene great confusion has been caused by the in­ genious but unnecessary transposition of the lines made by Bergk and other recent editors.

Meineke, in his Aristophanes, suggests οἵδ’ οἵδα (which Blaydes adopts) or εὐοὐδα.
The reason for this suggestion was not appa­ rent, but in his Vind.
Aristoph.
be gives the following explanation:
" Praxa­ gorse dicenti TO σποδεῖσθαι mulieribus per fortem fortunam suppetere, altera respondere vix potuit οὐκ οἰδα, sed εὐ οὶδα.”
It is plain therefore that Meineke altogether misapprehended the speaker's meaning;
for of course she is referring to the argument by which Praxagora has been endeavouring to meet her inquiry, and not to one of the sub­ ordinate facts on which that argument is based.—δεινὸν δ’ R. H. vulgo. δεινόν (without δ’) F. P. P1. Velsen.—ή μὴ ’μπειρία F. P. P1. Bergler, recentiores.

P1. inserts γέ before πον.125.
ὡς καὶ καταγελαστὸν TO πρα̑γpa MSS.
vulgo.
The line is rather jerky, but the woman is tying on her beard, and is perhaps convulsed with laughter.
Three editors have rewritten it, each differently.
Meineke has ὡς καταγελαστὸν του̑το πρᾱγμα.
Holden ὡς καταγελαστὸν πpayμα toti.
And Velsen (after Cobet) οὐκαταμελαστόν σοι, TO πρα̑γμα, with a note of interrogation at the end of the line.
129. πάριτ’ MSS. vulgo. πάριθ’ Le Fevre, Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Din­ dorf, Bothe.
No reason is given, and I can imagine none, for this alteration.
The plural is clearly required here, as in Acharnians 43.130.
κάθιζε παριών.
From not per­ ceiving the obvious meaning of these words (see the Commentary) the con­ jecturers have been busy in suggesting alterations.
Bergk began by proposing, not reading, κάθιζε Παίων or Πρίων.
Meineke reads κάθιζ ό παριὼν, and talks of the employment of παριὼν to describe an orator coming forward to speak, which is true but irrelevant.
Holden, as usual, follows Meineke.
Blaydes offers seven conjectures for the choice of his readers, of which Velsen adopts the second.
They are (1) κάθιζε.
παριὼν τις. (2) κάθιζε. πάριτε. (3) κάθιζε. σίγα. (4) σίγα. σιώπα. (5) κάθιζε, κάθιζε. (6) κάθιζε, Παύσων. (7) Στράτων, κά­ θιζε.132.
πρὶν πιεῖν MSS. vulgo.
Junta and Zanetti have πρὶν ποιεῖν and Farreus πρὶν ποιεῖς, but this can only have been per incuriam, since all read ἰδυὺ πιεῖν in the following line.
Fracini has the same mistake in 157.135.
κἀκεῖ MSS. Junta, Gormont, Brunck, recentiores.
ἐκεῖ the other editions before Brunck.

μεθυόντων MSS. Junta, Gormont, Kuster, recentiores.
But with the ex­ ceptions aforesaid the editions before Kuster have μεθύοντ’.142.
ἐμπεπωκότες Aldus, Junta, and, except as hereinafter mentioned, all the editions.
ἐκπεπωκότες R. Fracini, and the editions from Gelenius to Le Fevre (inclusive), and Invernizzi.
Scaliger however preferred ἐμπεπωκότες which was restored by Kuster, and has since been universally read :
H. and P., two good MSS., read ἐμπεπτωκότες, which must be intended for ἐμπεπωκότες, just as the ἐκπεπτωκότες of F. Pl. must be intended for ἐκπεπτωκότες.144.
κάθησ’ R. Fracini, Gelenius, and subsequent editions to and including Le Fevre, and Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.

ἔοικε φαυανθήσμαι F. P. P1. Junta, Gormont.
But otherwise the older editions have ἔαικεν ἀφαυανθήσομαι.153.
ἐμὴν μίαν.
These words have not found favour with some eminent scho­ lars.
Dawes proposed ἐμὴν βίαν, Toup γνώμην ἐμὴν Kidd (editingDawes) ῥώμην ἐμὴν ;
Reiske at first conjectured ἐμὴν βίαν, but was afterwards convinced by Valcknaer that the MS.
reading is cor­ rect, and says, " Subintelligitur γνώμην, et idem vult atque si dixisset κατὰ τὴν ἐμὴν καίτοι μια̑ς γνώμην.”
Meineke sug­ gests Μίκαν, as the name of some female vintner.
But no one has altered the text except Velsen, who for μίαν sub­ stitutes τινας.157.
πιεῖν γ’ R. Invernizzi, recentiores.
πιεῖν (without γ’) H. F. P. P1. and all editions before Invernizzi.161.
ἐκκλησιάσουσ’.
This was sug­ gested by Bentley, and afterwards by Kuster in his notes, but it was first introduced into the text by Dindorf, who is followed by Bergk and all later editors except Holden.
ἀκκλησιάζουσ MSS. and all editions before Dindorf, and Bothe afterwards.
ἐκκλησιάζουσ’ is unmetrical in all the MSS.
except P1. which for οὐκ
As, has οὐ, and in all the editions except Brunck and Invernizzi who follow P1. here, and find room for ἄν after ἔτερ
ον in the following line.
Holden reads ἐκκλησιω̑σ’ which was an invention of Buttman.166.
& δύστηνε F. Pl. Aldus, Junta, Gormont, Blaydes, Velsen.
σὔδύστηνε R. H. vulgo.
This and several other lines in this part of the play are now missing in P.167. ἐκεῖνον’ ἐπιβλέψασα R. F. P. P1. and all editions (except Aldus, Junta, and Gormo.nt, who with H. read ἐκεῖμον’ εἴ τι βλέψασα, obviously a mere mis­ spelling) before Dindorf.
Elmsley at Ach.
178 making a vast number of corrections to support a very doubtful rule of his own invention, proposed ἐκεινονί.
βλέψασα and so Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
But the compound ἐπι­ βλέψασα seems far more suitable.
At the commencement of this line, by a very singular mistake, all editions before Brunck read μὰ Δῖ ’Επίγονον δι’ ’Επί­ γονον, the MS.
reading, was replaced by Brunck and has since been universally received.-
Perhaps it is wrong to speak of Elmsley's rule, because he does not pro­ fess to lay down any absolute rule.
He merely says, " Longe rarius quam puta­ ram anapaestum in hoc metri genere inchoat ultima vocis syllaba."
And he adds that of the places in which such an arrangement occurs, many admit of an easy emendation, giving as his first example, καὶ τοῖσι φενακισμοῖσιν ἐξαπατω­ μένην, where he would change τοῖσι into τοῖτ.
And this doubtless is the reason why, in 154 supra, Dindorf prefers τοῖς the reading of the inferior, to τοῖστ the reading of the better, MSS.
But if it is admitted, as it is, that Aristophanes sometimes so wrote, it is merely a question of the MSS.
and of the ear, whether he did so in any particular instance.

But if the μὲν two lines above is correct, δι seems necessary here.

The word is variously ac­ cented in the MSS.

ὤμοσας.
All the MSS., and all the editions before Meineke have ὠνὰ­ μασας.
Bentley saw that ὤμοσας was necessary (for any man might name, though only a woman would swear by, Aphrodite), but seems, per incuriam, to have written it ὤμνυσας.
And ὤμοσας is read by Dobree, Meineke, recentiores.

όρίζεται H. vulgo.
οὺχ όρίζεται F. P. Junta, Gormont.
όρείζεται R. οὐ χρήζετε (a mere gloss) Pl. όρίζεται seems perfectly right (see the Commentary), but many efforts have been made to amend it.
Bentley proposed ὠστίζεται or ὠθίζεται, Hermann ὀργίζεται, an anony­ mous writer in the Classical Journal ἐρίζεται, Meineke ὡρᾀζεται, in the sense of delicias facit, Velsen ἐρείδεται.
Meineke's conjecture, though intro­ duced into the text by himself, and adopted by Holden, Blaydes, and Yelsen, is far the most unsuitable of all:
for Praxagora is plainly on the side of Thrasybulus, and she is, in this section of her speech, criticizing the action of the People in regard to their foreign relations, not satirizing the airs and graces of any individual orator.
In the next line Blaydes changes αὐτὸς into αὐτὴν which he does not explain, and which (as he reads ὡρᾀζεται) it is not easy to understand.
204.
ἁνήρ.
The MSS., and editions before Beaker, read ὰνὴρ, but Bentley perceived that the article is required, and the aspirate is added by Bekker and all subsequent editors.205.

εἰ τοῦτο MSS. vulgo.
Dobree's translation (as to which see the Com­ mentary) must have arisen from his not observing that the sentence is inter­ rogative ;
but the note of interrogation at the close of the next line had already been introduced by Brunck, who is followed by all subsequent editors except Bergk and Meineke.221.
πρὸ τοῦ Bekker, recentiores, ex­ cept Bothe.
But as a rule the two words are united into one, προτοῦ, here and elsewhere in all or most of the MSS.
and vulgo.223*.
πέττουσι κ.τ.λ.
This line was introduced from R. by Invemizzi.
It is omitted in all the other MSS.
and in all editions before Invernizzi.226.
αὑαῖς P1. " Hotibius," Bekker, recentiores.
αὐταῖς It. H. F. P. and all editions before Bekker, except Portus, Scaliger, Le Fevre, and Brunck who read αὐτοῖς.227.
οἰνον φιλοῦσ’ εὔζωρ
ον ὣσπερ καὶ πρὸ τοῦ Hanovius, Bergk, Blaydes.
The MSS.
readings are unmetrical.
τὸν οἵνον εὒζωρ
ον φιλοῦσ’ ὥσπερ καὶ πρ
οτοῦ R. H. Le Fevre.
And so (with φιλοῦσιν for φιλοῦσ’) F. P. P1. In Aldus the reading of R. H. is made metrical by omitting the καὶ.
And this is followed by all editors (excepting Le Fevre) down to Bergk.
But all the MSS.
have ὥσπερ κσὶ πρὸ τοῦ as in the eight corresponding lines, and this has been replaced by Bergk and all succeeding editors.
It is therefore necessary to make the earlier part of the line correspond with the other eight, and this is done by Hanovius as in the text.
Cobet con­ jectured πιεῖν φιλοῦσ’ εὔζωρ
ον which is accepted by Velsen.
But πιεἵν is not only unwarranted, it is superfluous, since εὔζωρον φιλοῦσι is identical with πιεῖν εὔζωρον φιλοῦσι.
Meineke reads εὔζωρον ἐμπἰνουσιν, and so Holden, but this is travelling far from the MSS.234.
σώζειν ἐπιθυμήσουσιν R. Inver­ nizzi, recentiores.
σώζειν ἐπιθυμοῦσιν H. and all the editions before Brunck, except Grynaeus, who saves the metre by inserting μὲν after σῶζειν.
Le Fevre, however, had conjectured ἐπιθυμήσουσιν, and Scaliger μάλ’ ἐπιθυμοῦσιν (which Brunck reads);
and both Bentley and Kuster observed that it would be neces­ sary to adopt one or other of these conjectures.
F. P. P1. save the metre at the expense of the sense, reading σώζουσιν, ἐπιθυμοῦσιν.
For εἲτα (R. H. Pl. vulgo) F. and P. have εὶ τὰ.235.
μᾶλλον MSS.
(the line is now missing in P.) and all editions before Dindorf.
Suidas, s. v. θᾶττον, says at τὶ του μᾶλλον τὰ atria τη̑ς τεκούσης θᾶττον ὲπιπέμψειεν ἄν.
It is not easy to see what Suidas meant by ἀντὶ τοῦ μάλλον.
It seems as if he, or the grammarian he is quoting, were offering a conjecture on the line.
Person, however, thought that we should read θᾶττον here:
and it is accordingly read by Dindorf and subsequent editors.
But the word seems rather out of place.
Praxagora men­ tions two benefits which will accrue to the soldiers from their mothers being in power, viz. (1) they will not be recklessly exposed to danger;
and (2) they will be abundantly supplied with provisions.
—ἐπιπέμψειεν R. H. P1. vulgo. ὲπιπέμψειας F.236. ποριζειν. Velsen inserts δ’ after this word.
But in truth the line is merely explanatory of the preceding statement.239.
ἐάσω R. H. F. vulgo.
This line also is now missing in P. ἐάσω γε P1.— κἄν MSS. vulgo. γ’ ἄν Bentley. δ’ ἄν Brunck, Bekker. δ’ ήν Dindorf (in notes). ταῦτ’ ἐὰν Bergk, Blaydes.
Bothe, Meineke, Holden, and Velsen annex ταῦτα to the preceding clause τὰ δ’ ἄλλ’, ἐάσω ταἴτα.
For πείθησθέ (MSS. vulgo), πίθησθέ is substituted by the same editors as on 209 supra.— μοιR. H. P1. vulgo. μου F. Junta, Gormont, Zanetti, Farrens.240. διάξετε R. F. P. P1. vulgo. διέξετε H. διείξετε Aldus alone.
This is the meaning of the entry-in Porson's Ad­ versaria, which Dobree professes him­ self unable to understand.243.

Is not given by Fracini, and is now missing in P.255.
εὶπον R. H. F. P. vulgo. εὶποιμ’ P1. whence Brunck reads μέν by εὶποιμ’, and so Invernizzi.
Elmsley, at Medea 266, objects to this, but probably only on the ground that it makes the par­ ticle μὲν commence an anapaest, as to which see his note on Acharnians 127.
Brunck's reading seems to me very reasonable.
2C2. ταυτὶ ρὶν κ.τ.λ.
This single line is by H. and all editions before Brunck attributed to Praxagora;
the Woman's speech commencing with the following line.265.

and editions into έστ’ ὰποτρέχειν.
With this line P. now ends.
In Brunck's time it continued to line 444.
Between these two lines, therefore, we have such readings only from P. as Brunck thought it desirable to record.286. ώς μη’ ποτ’MSS. vulgo.

Elmsley doubting if ώς could be thus used without ᾱν.
Meineke proposed ῖνα for ώς.287.
ήμᾱς MSS.
vulgo.
Bergk sug­ gested a full stop after followed by ήμῖν γὰρ o κίνδυνος κ.τ.λ.;
whilst Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.) would change ήμᾱς into όρμᾱσθ’, observing that the particle γὰρ " ad illam de viri nomine etiam atque etiam usurpando admoni­ tionem referri non potest."
The γὰρ of course refers to the possibility of their speaking of themselves as women.289.
χωμῶμεν κ.τ.λ.
In the MSS.
this first line is both here and in the antistrophe divided into a dimeter iambic and (except in P1.) a trochaic dimeter catalectic, but the remaining twenty lines are divided very much, though not quite, as in the text.
But in all the editions before Dindorf, the first line is read as here, and the twenty glyconics which follow are combined into ten double lines.
The present arrangement is due to Dawes, Person, and Gaisford (Notes to Hepbaestion, chap. xi), was first introduced into the text by Dindorf, and is now universally accepted.
For ώνδρες ὴπείλησε γὰρ P1. reads ώὂὶ γὰρ ὴπείλησεν, apparently with a view of getting this line into the same metre as the four which precede it290.

The τὸ was omitted in the editions before Brunck.299. χρἣ” μ’R. H. F. and all editions, except those from Gelenius to Le Fevre inclusive, of whom Gelenius and Portus omit the μ’, and Rapheleng, Scaliger, and Le Fevre read χρἣν γ’. P1. has χρὴ μ’.303.
έντοῖς στεφανώμασιν.
These words are omitted in all the MSS.
ex­ cept R., and in all the editions before Invernizzi.
R. has στεφανώμασι and so Invernizzi and Bekker, and I think that this is admissible at the end of a sen­ tence.
See the Commentary on 289.
But the final ν is added by Dindorf and all subsequent editors.
305.
ὰργύριον φέρων MSS. vulgo.
To avoid the recurrence of φέρων at the close of two succeeding lines (as they were in his and all previous editions)
Brunck, not unreasonably, changed the first φέρων into λαβών, and he is followed by lnvernizzi, Dindorf, and Bothe.307.
αὺανκαὶ Reiske, Bergk, Blaydes. aS καὶ R. H. and all editions before Brunck and Invernizzi and Bekker afterwards.
καὶ (omitting αὺ) F. P. P1. Brunck.
It is obvious, having regard to the strophe, that αὺ καὶ is one syllable too short;
and many years ago noting the particularity of the δύο and τρεῑς in the latter part of the sentence, I came to the conclusion that for οὐ we should read ε̃να;
and it was an agree­ able surprise to find that the same idea bad occurred to Bentley.
But I fear that the short syllable ε̄ν cannot end a line like this in the middle of a sentence, and I have come round to Reiske's suggestion αὐον dry, stale, as the simplest and most probable recti­ fication of the metre.
Other con­ jectures are άν καῑσως (καὶ ῐσως), Dawes;
ὰν καὶ πρὸς, Porson;
an emendation surely unworthy of Porson, but followed by Dindorf, Meineke, and Holden:
and αίτον̑ no!, Velsen.
Bothe, for ἄρτον αὐ καὶ, reads ἀρτίδιον άν καὶ to the utter destruction of the metre.
312. ἡ δ ̓ H. Gormont, Kuster, recen­ tiores.

An anapaest is not often found follow­ ing a tribrach ;
but here the sequence is permissible, as Blaydes observes, by reason of the punctuation and pause between the two feet.327-330.
τίς ἐστιν;
... ποθεν.
These entire four lines are given to the new­ comer, as in the text, by Brunck and subsequent editors:
but in all the edi­ tions before Brunck, the words in the second line, νὴ τὸν Δί ̓αἰτὸς δη̑τ ̓ ἐκεȋνος, are the answer of Blepyrus to the ques­ tion asked in the first line ;
whilst the final ποθεν is also given to Blepyrus as a denial of the question asked in the previous part of the fourth line:
cf. infra 389, 976.
But this sense, as Brunck remarks, is hardly compatible with the οὐκ which follows.
For the alteration in the second line Brunck has the authority of F. P. P'.;
though H. is in accord with the older arrange­ ment, and R. has a stroke at the com­ mencement of the line, which is its way of introducing a new speaker.
Brunck refers to very similar passages in Terence, Andr. iv. 6, 6;
Eun. iii. 4, 7:
and on the whole it seems better to acquiesce in his arrangement.333.

which the iota.

In the first nine lines of this speech, F. and P1. omit the latter part of each alternate line.
Here from Δι- (in Διόνυσ
ον to the end;
in 359 from μόνον;
in 361 from μὲν γὰρ;
in 363 from ἰατρόν;
and in 865 from A- hin Ἀμύνων).360.
μοι τὸ R. H. vulgo.
F. and P1. omit the τὸ, and F. has μοι for μου.362.
ἄνθρωπος Ἀχραδούσιος MSS.vulgo:
and I think rightly, the meaning being " this Achradusian fellow whoever he is."
Brunck, however, under the erro­ neous idea that the first syllable in ἀχρὰς is short, prefixed the article, and most of the recent editors aspirate the word:
while Blaydes and Velsen do the like for ἄνθρωπος.364.
καταπρώκτων R. and (ascorrected) H. vulgo.
κατὰ πρώκτων F. and (origin­ ally) H. κατὰ, πρωκτῶν P. κατὰ πρωκτὸν P1. Brunck, Invemizzi, Bekker, Bothe, Meineke, and Velsen.
This had been previously conjectured by Bentley, and was afterwards supported by Dobree who refers to Hdt. ii.
84, where it is said that all the Egyptian doctors are specialists, some of one part of the body, and some of another:
and some are ἰητροὶ τῶν κατὰ νηδύν.
But even if Aristophanes were intending to allude to any real or supposed doctors, τ κατὰ πρωκτὸν, I do not think that he could have forborne to satirize pri­ marily the vices of Amynon and Anti­ sthenes.
Brunck's remark, " non minus quam medici, innui possunt drauci, qua in ambiguitate consistit iocus," is just as applicable to the reading of the best MSS.
which he rejects, as to that of the worst MS.
which he adopts.365. ἀμ’ οἰδ’ MSS. vulgo. a?, οἰδ’ (Hem, scio.

χιτώνιον was introduced by Fracini, and has kept its place ever since.377. νὴ Δί’ R. F. P. P1. Bentley, Brunck, recentiores. νὴ τὰν Δί’ H. edds. before Brunck.
Bentley proposed to give the words ὄρθριον μὲν οὖνto Ble­ pyrus :

380.

All the other editions before Brunck omit the τὸ.381.

Blaydes, Velsen. οἰδὲν ἄλλο P. P1. οὐδέν ἄλλον R. H. F. vulgo.—τονδὶ φέρων, see the Commentary, τὸν θίλακον MSS.

τὸν θύλακον can hardly be right without some alteration in the verse.
Tyrwhitt proposed οὐδὲν μᾶλλον.
Brunck reads ἔχων pa
At οὐδὲν ἄλλο γ’ ἦ τόν θύλακον. "
Recte quidem οἰδὲν ἄλλο γε.
Equidem versum post 381 excidisse suspicor,” Elmsley, in note to Tyrwhitt.
Invernizzi and Velsen follow Brunch.
Dobree says " Collato Br. forsan legen­ dum, ἀλλ’ ὔστερ
ος ἦλθον ω̃στ’ ἔχων αὶσχύνομαιΜὰ τὸν Δί’ οὐδὲν—sed aliquid gravioris corruptelae latere suspicor.
An τονδὶ frustra ferens τὸν θίλακοι ?
Μὰ recte quidem per se :
sed facile ex prava emendatione oriri potuit, ut supra 167."
It seems to me that Dobree intended to commence the line with τονδὶ, instead of Μὰ τὸν at, but did not indicate.
probably had not thought out.
the con­ sequent alterations which would be necessary.
Meineke reads μὰ Δί’ οὐδέν’ ἄλλον μᾶλλον, which sounds like a bur­ lesque of Tyrwhitt's proposal, but is followed by Holden.384.
ἦλθ’ ἀθρόος P1. Brunck, recen­ tiores, except Meineke and Holden.
For ἀθρόος Meineke reads α̃θρους. ἦλθεν ἀθρόος H. F. P1. ἦλθεν ἀθρόως R. and editions before Brunck;
the metre, however.
having been kept right from Gelenius downwards by substituting οὐδέποτ for οὐδεπώποτ’
Dawes retaining οίδεπώποτ’ reads ἦλθ’ ἀθρύως, Misc. Crit. p. 193.
Holden has ἦλθεν ὰθρόως, omitting the τὴν before πύκνα.385.
πάντας σκυτοτόμοις R. Bergler, recentiores, except Blaydes, and so Le Fevre and Kuster had previously con­ jectured.
πάντες σκυτοτόμοι H. F. P. and all the editions before Bergler, taking the words, apparently, as an exclamation whispered amongst Chremes and his neighbours.
Bentley, before R.'s reading was known, suggested σκυτο­ τόμοις, but left πάντες untouched, and so Blaydes reads.
Several of the older editions for ὴκάξομεν write εἰκάξομεν.387.
λευκοπληθὴς R. F. P1. and all the editions except Aldus, which, with H., reads λευκοπληθὲς.392.
ἀποίμωξὀν H. and (as corrected) R. vulgo. ἀποίμωξόν F. P1. and (origin­ ally) R.397.

Schömann (De Comitiis, I. x, Paley's translation), after observing that " the Proedri, in giving permission to the people to declare their sentiments, are said λόγον or γνώμας προτιθέναι," adds in a note, "Aristophanes uses the expression γνώμας καθιέναι in the same sense, Eccles.
397, unless we should read προθεȋναȋναι,” and Bergk and subsequent editors change καθεȋναι into προθεȋναι.400.

μέντούφασκεν H. Bekker, recen­ tiores, except Bothe.
The readings of R. and P1. though not accented in the same way, mean the same thing, μὲν του̃φασκεν R., μέντ’ oC ’φασκεν P'., and the editions before Scaliger.
F.'s read­ ing, however, μέντ οὺ ’φασκεν means the very reverse, .. he excused himself by saying that be had not a garment to wear."
And this is adopted in Scaliger, Le Fevre, Brunck, and Invernizzi.
Tyrwhitt, supposing this the ordinary reading, conjectured μέντοι ’φασκεν, and so Bothe writes it.—ἱμάτιον B. H. F. vulgo.
ἱμάτιόν γ’ P1.420. τω̑ν σκυλοδεψω̑ν R. Fracini, Portus, recentiores.

See Wasps 775.
Dindorf in his notes, however, preferred the " more Attic " form ἀποκλήη, and this is adopted by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.
ἀποκλίνη τη̑ θὑρα R. H. F. all editions before Brunck.
ἀποκλίνη τὴν θύραν P. ἀποκλίνη τη̑ς θύρας P1.
The reading of the older editions was not satisfactory, and Le Fevre suggested ἀποκλείη τὴν θύραν, Kuster ἐπικλίνη τν θύραν, and Brunck ἀποκλείση̩ τη̩̑ θύρα̩.
Brunck, however, adopted Kuster's sug­ gestion, and so Invernizzi, Bekker, and Bothe.433.
γὰρ MSS. vulgo.
Dobree, quite unnecessarily, suggested γ’ἄρ’ or ἄp᾽, referring to Birds 1371, which, though similar in language, involves a some­ what different idea.
Yet ἄp᾽ is adopted by Meineke and Holden.436.
καὶ τί εἰπε MSS. vulgo.

ἄλλως MSS. vulgo.
ἄλλος Gele­ nius and all subsequent editions before Brunck.
Tyrwhitt, supposing this to be the traditional reading, corrected it to ἄλλως, but Elmsley, in his note to Tyrwhitt, observes “ἄλλος typographi error est, qui ex ed. Gelenii in sequentes manavit.
"444. βουλεύοντε Fracini, Gelenius, recentiores.
βουλεύονται R. δουλεύοντε H. F. P1. and all editions, except Fracini, before Gelenius.
With this line P. ended in Brunck's time, see on 282 supra:
so that henceforth we have no assistance from that valuable MS.447.
χρυσἲR. H. vulgo. χρυσἰα F. P1. An χρυσὸν?”

μαρτίρων τ᾽ ἐναντίον H. F. P1. and all edd. except Grynaeus, before Bekker.
μαρτύρωνγ᾽ἐναντίον R. Grynaeus, Bekker, recentiores.
But this would mean "at least if they borrowed before wit­ nesses,” so limiting his acquiescence to cases where witnesses had actually been present at the transaction.
But it is obvious that this is not the meaning of Blepyrus.
He admits that men would cheat, where there were no witnesses to prove the loan:
but be goes further, and adds that they would cheat " even though they borrowed before witnesses.”
The τ᾽ιs obviously right:
the y' seems to have come from 448 supra.455.
ἐπιτρέπεινσεR. H. F. vulgo.
ἐπι­ τρέπεινγεΡ1. Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf,
Bo the. Cobet proposed orι­ τρέπεινδεȋν, Blaydes and Velsen read ȏ τι;

They seem to have forgotten the use of σὲ in 435, 436 supra.458.
ἅπαντάτ᾽ΜSS.
(except that R. H. for τ᾽have θ᾽) vulgo.
Cobet suggested ἅπαντ᾽ἅρ᾽which is adopted by Bergk, recentiores.
But Blepyrus is here simply asking for further information, not, as in the following questions, drawing an inference.
461.
οὐδ᾽ ἔτιR. Gelenius, recentiores.
οὐδέ τι H. edd. before Gelenius.
This line is omitted in F. P1.462.

νῷν MSS. vulgo.
Dobree, on Birds 1008, proposed νὼ, that is τοȋς τηλικούτοιςήλίκοι νὼ, but I much doubt if the words could bear this meaning, and nobody but Meineke has intro­ duced νὼ into the text.
468.
κινεῖν MSS. editions before Ge­ lenius;
and Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Bothe, and Bergk afterwards.
Gelenius introduced βινεῖν, which flowed on until the reading of the MSS.
and the older editions was replaced by Brunck.
Din­ dorf always changes κινεῖν into βινεῖν on the strength of his own ipse dixit on Ach.
1052, “ Hac signification κινεῖν nusquam ridetur dictum esse."
Far more accurately Bergler states “ κινεῖν in hac significatione saepe usurpatur."
Only Meineke, Blaydes, and Velsen follow Dindorf here.469, 470.
These two lines, though found in all the MSS., are omitted in Aldus, Fracini, Gelenius, Portus, and Kuster.470.
ἀριστᾷς R. P1. Le Fevre, recen­ tiores.
ὰριστᾷ H. F. and all editions in which the line is found before Le Fevre.
But I think that in most of the editions it is meant to annex the τε which follows, and become the second person plural.471. ἀλλ’ εἰ R. H. P1. vulgo. ἀλλ’ ἦ F. Junta, Gormont, as if there were a colon after ξυνοίσει.473.
λόγος τέ MSS.
and all editions before Dindorf.
The passage is twice cited by Suidas, s. vv. γεραίτερ
ος and μῶρα,and in each case though some of the MSS.
read λόγος τέ, the bulk of them have λόγ
ος γέ;
and the γε is sub­ stituted for the τε here also by Dindorf, recentiores.
But this alteration does not seem to improve the sense,-γεραι­ τέρων R. P'.
Portus, recentiores.
γηραι­ τέρων H. F. edd. before Portus.474. δσ’ ἀν ἀνώητ’ ἡ μῶρα Bentley, Bekker, recentiores. δσ’ ἄν ἀνόητα καὶ μῶρα H. F. editions before Brunck. ὅσ’ ἄν ἀνόητα χῆ μῶρα R. Invernizzi. ὰνόηθ’ δσ’ ἄν καὶ μῶρα P'. Brunck.
Le Fevre suggested δσ’ἄν ἀνόητα μῶρά τε which Kuster in his notes approved, but did not adopt in his text.482.
ἐκτοὔπισθεν MSS. vulgo.
Blaydes suggests and Velsen reads ἐξόπισθεν.— καταφυλάξη R. H. vulgo.
φυλάξη F. P1. παραφυλάξη Meineke, Holden. σου φι­ λὰξη Blaydes.
It seems probable that καταφυλάξη is derived from the preceding φύλαττε, and has ousted a verb signifying the damage feared, whether detection, theft, or otherwise.
Thus if it were theft, it might be some word analogous to the περιράγη of Ach.
258 or the ἀπέβλισε of Birds 498.
The conjectures proposed do not meet the case.484.
ἡμῑν MSS. vulgo, but Gelenius, probably by a printer's error, has ὑμῖν, and so Portus and subsequent editions until Brunck restored ἡμῖν.—δ’ ἅν αἰ­ σχύνην φέροι R. Brunck, recentiores.
a, αἰσχύνην φέροι H. F. and all editions before Brunck. δέ γ’ αἰσχύνην φέρει P1.485. ἀνδράσιν F. Brunck, recentiores.
ἀνδράσι R. H. P1. edd. before Brunck.486-8. πανταχῆ σκοπουμένη. καὶ περι­ σκοπουμένη R. H. F. vulgo. περισκοπου­ μένη (without the καὶ) P1.
The antis­ trophe shows that an iambic dipody has dropped out somewhere in this and the two following lines;
and the best way of filling the lacuna, in my opinion, is by supplying (with Valcke­ naer) from Birds 424, Thesm.
666 the words ra τῆδε καὶ.
It seems clear, however, that unless another imperative is introduced, as is done by Blaydes, the καὶ before περισκ
οπουμένη cannot stand, and Bentley's suggestion to substitute εὐ is adopted by Velsen.
But I think that the corruption goes a little deeper, and that the specific directions τἀκεῖσε κ.τ. λ. would have been preceded by a more general direction such as πανταχῆ.
See Birds 423;
Thesm 665;
Eur. Phoen. 265;
and I have therefore substituted πανταχῆ for καὶ περι-. R. it may be observed separates περὶ from σκοπουμένη.
Holden in his first edition read τὰ τῆδε as I do, but in his later edition, not seeing his way to prevent the anacoluthon, left the lacuna un­ filled.
The other suggestions for sup­ plying it are, τἀνθένδε καὶ, Cobet, which is vastly inferior to τὰ τὴδε καὶ, but is accepted by Velsen:
περιστρέφου (before τἀκεῖσε) Hermann;
τὰ π άν θ’ δρα Meineke;
and φύλατθ’ ὅπ ως (before μὴ ξυμφορὰ) Blaydes, which is probable enough, and which he places in the text.
The MSS.
and earlier editions have κὰκεῖσε, but Le Fevre suggested τἀκεῖσε, which indeed seems required by τἀκ δεξιᾶς and is now universally adopted.
τἀκ δεξιᾶς is the reading of R. and this too was suggested by Le Fevre and is read by Invernizzi and all subsequent editors.
τά τ’ ἐκ δεξιᾶς H. F. and all editions before Kuster. τά γ’ ἐκ δεξιᾶς Kuster, Bergler.
τά r' ἐκ δεξιῶν Pl. ἐκ δεξιῶν Brunck, who considered the τά τ’ to represent τὰ τῆδε which.
he also read.-γενήσεται TO πρᾶγμα R. H. F. vulgo.
γένηται Pl.;
and Blaydes amongst many other con­ jectures suggested τὸ π payμ ί σοι γένηται which Velsen adopts.
Le Fevre pro­ posed to get rid of the anacoluthon by reading περισκόπει κενουμένη, and Brunck by changing the xai before περισκ
οπου­ μένη into κύκλῳ, but neither of these alterations satisfies the metre.490. ὡρμώμεθ’ Portus, recentiores. όρμώμεθ’ MSS. edd. before Portus.495. ἡμᾶς ὅψεται Hermann, Dindorf, Bergk, Meineke, Holden. ὄψεθ’ ἡμᾶς (contra metrum) R. H. vulgo.

ἰδὼν Velsen after a still more hesitating suggestion of Meineke.— κακείπη R. Bergler, Invernizzi, recen­ tiores.
κατέπτη H. F. P1. edd. before Gelenius.
κατόπτη Gelenius and sub­ sequent editions until Kuster, who in his text replaced κατέπτη, but in his notes suggested that the true reading was κατείοι.
He probably meant κατείπη, which in Bergler's edition is introduced into the text.
Brunck, who never did justice to Bergler, attacked this reading as follows:
" Quod ex Kusteri con­ jectura in textum intulit Berglerus, χἡμῶν ἵσως κατείπη, ineptissimum est.
Multo satius erat corruptam lectionem intactam relinqucre, quam sententiam tarn absurdam ingenioso Comico affin­ gere.
Levis menda cuivis paulo acutius cernenti statim in oculos incidit.
Scri­ bendum erat χἡμῶν ἔσω κατάπ τη, et medium in nostrum agmen involet.”
Unfortu­ nately for Brunck, before any other edition of the play was published, the Ravenna MS. was given to the public, and entirely confirmed the reading of Bergler's edition:
and Bergler's κατεἱπη has been accepted and Brunck's ἔσω κατάπτη repudiated by every subsequent editor without any exception.508.
χάλα MSS. vulgo.
This singular imperative coming in the midst of plurals, has naturally been found very perplexing.
Le Fevre suggested χαλᾶτε, which is read by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Bekker.
Elmsley at Ach. 178 deal­ ing with Brunck's reading, observed “ Fortasse χάλα συ.”
He meant συ to represent συναποὺς, and would have read χάλα συναπτοὺς, not χάλα σὺ συναπ­ τούς.
Blaydes offers five conjectures (1) χαλᾶθ᾽ ύφαπτοὺς, (2) χαλᾶσθ᾽ ἱφαπτοὐς, (3) χαλάσασθ᾽ ὑφαπτοὺς, (4) χαλᾶτέ θ᾽ ἀπτοὺς, (5) χαλᾶτε βαπτοὺς, and in his Addenda gives several others.
But see the Commentary.—συναπτοὺς H.F. vulgo.

I had long thought that the true remedy for the deficient syllable in this verse consisted in dupli­ cating the δὴ of the MSS., and I now find that Bentley here, as in 307 supra, ante nos nostra dixerat.

κεῖται δὲ Pl. Various conjectures have been made for supplying the missing syllable.
Le Fevre led the way by proposing to insert νῦν after ἔργον.

Brunck read ἤδη κεῖται, which is followed by Invernizzi and Bekker.

Bothe, in his notes, suggested ἐντανθοī, and Bergk ἐνταυθί, which is introduced into the text by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.
Cobet recom­ mends the further change of τι κακόν into κακόν τι, and Velsen accepts this also:
but whilst the suggestion of Bothe and Bergk is probable enough, that of Cobet is open to grave metrical objec­ tions.
533.
ω̃σπερ εὶχον.
Meineke, being unable to understand these words, which, he says, " probabilem interpre­ tationem non admittunt," proposes οὶπιρ εὶπον, a proposal which nobody has accepted.536.
ἐπιβαλου̃σα R. F. Pl. Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
ἐπιλαβοῡσα H. editions before Brunck.
Kuster, in a note, says, "Lege ἐπιβαλοίσά τε,” but in his text has ἐπιλαβου̂σά τε, which has also crept into Bergler's text.—τ
ου̃γκυ­ κλον R. H. vulgo.
του̃ κύκλον F. του̃ αύκλου P1.538. μόνον οὐ R. H. F. Brunck, recentiores.
μονονοὐ Pl. edd. before Brunck.
But μονονοὺ would mean all but, which is not the meaning here.540.
ĩν ἀλεαίνοιμι R. F. P1. Kuster, recentiores.
It had already been con­ jectured by Scaliger and Bentley.
ĩνα λεαίνοιμι all edds. before Kuster.— ὴμπισχόμην R. H. P1. vulgo.
And this seems right, see an excellent note by Elmsley on Medea 1128.
But Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen read ἠμπισχόμην after a grammarian in Bek­ ker's Anecdota, p. 281.
ἐμπισχόμενον F.541.

Brunck changed this to ñδησθιί, relying on the statement in the Etymol.
Magn., s.v. ñδεισθα τὸ κοινότεριν, διὰ του̂ E. το δὲ A’ττικώτιρ, διὰ του̂ H. μ̃δησθα, Ευ̃πολισ ;
and see Moeris, s.v.
And he is followed by subsequent editors, except as aforesaid.
But this is the old error of supposing that the commoner
It form was never used by Attic writers.
See Pierson's note on Moeris, ubi supr.554.
κμ́θησο MSS. Scaliger (in notes), Kuster, recentiores.
κμ́θισο all editions before Kuster.559.
ε̃οται TO λοιπίτ.
This and the following line are omitted in F. P1.
owing, no doubt, to the circumstance that 561 commences with the same words.
—ου̃νεκα R. H. vulgo.
εīνεκα Blaydes, Velsen.570. μοί MSS. vulgo.
Cobet (ubi supra) would read ̃τι which is absurd, for Blepyrus had not yet heard, and of course had not gainsaid, Praxagora's scheme.
Yet Meineke and Holden read ε̃τι.
Blaydes and Velsen have ε̃χειτ, which, they say, is a conjecture of Dindorf.571-580.
The metrical scheme of this little chorus is as follows :
—
With the exception of four trochaic lines, each line consists of a choriamb and a (sometimes truncated) Ionic a minore.
See the Commentary.. 571. σε R. H. F. vulgo. γε P1.—πυκνὴν R. F. P1. Junta, Gormont, Bekker, and (except Bothe) recentiores.
πυκνὰν H. all other editions before Bekker;
and Bothe.
After πυκὴν all the MSS.
and (with the .variations mentioned below) all the editions insert φρένα καὶ φιλό­ σοφον, a manifest gloss, destructive of the metre.
Dindorf proposed to change φιλόσοφον into φιλόδημον, and ταίσι below into ταίς σαίσι, so manufacturing out of the first three lines of the choral ode a couple of heroic hexameters —νυ̂ν δὴ δεî at πυκνὴν φρένα καὶ φιλόδημον ἐγείρειν I φροντίδ’ ἐπισταμένην ταîς σαίσι φιλαισιν ἀμύνειν.
And had not the trochaic dipodies barred his further pro­ gress, we should probably have had the entire ode recast in that heroic, but extremely improbable, metre, and cf. on 577.
Blaydes brings these two hexameters into the text:
and Velsen also introduces the first, merely changing φιλόδημον into φιλόμ
ουσον, but does not accept the second.573.
κοινη̂ MSS.
vulgo.
Reiske sug­ gested κοιναίς (to agree with εὐτυχίαισιν) which Blaydes adopts:
whilst Meineke, leaving κοινη̂ untouched, obtains a simi­ lar result by changing εὐτυχίαισιν into εὐτυχία̣ νῡν.576.
δηλου̃ν MSS. vulgo.
δηλου̂ δ’ Meineke. δηλου̂σ’ Holden, after a con­ jecture of Dindorf.
δηλον δ’ Blaydes, Velsen.—δύνασαι Blaydes, Velsen, the former comparing Clouds 811 ἀπολάψεις ο̃τι πλείστον δύνασαι.
δύναται MSS. vulgo, of which some take the nominative to be ἐπίνοια and others καιρός.
Blaydes and Velsen take καιρὸς as governing δηλου̂ν,It istime to show what you can do.
­ καιρός MSS.
vulgo.
καιρὸς Hermann, Dindorf, Bergk, Meineke, Holden.577.

δεῖται τυί γε Holden. ώς δεῖται γε Velsen.
Holden's alteration satisfies the metre:
but Blaydes's dtlrat γάρ rov (omitting τινος after σοφοῡ) makes the line absolutely unmetrical.
Brunck indeed omits the τινος, and so, he says, “ pulcher emergit hexameter heroicus.”
A choriamb and Ionic a minore, are of course equivalent to two dactyls and a spondee, the second moiety of an heroic hexameter:
and the temptation to alter the preceding verse into the commencement of the hexa­ meter proved too strong for the virtue of Brunck and Dindorf.
See on 571 supra.584.
ἐθελήσουσιν R. H. Kuster, recen­ tiores.
ἐθελήσουσι F. P1. editions before Kuster.—ἠθάσι MSS. vulgo;
but P1. has γρ. ἤθεσι, and ἤθεσι is read by Brunck (who knew no other MS. but P1) and Invernizzi.
587.
ἀρχη̄ς MSS.
vulgo.
Bergk made an unhappy conjecture of ἀρετη̄ς which he did not himself introduce into the text, but Blaydes and Velsen have done 80.—ἐστιν R. Brunck, recentiores.
ἐστι H. F. P1. edd. before Brunck.592. μηδέ ... πολλὴν R. H. vulgo. καὶ μὴ... πολλὴν F. Junta, Gormont. καὶ μὴ ... πολλὰ P1.—οὐδ’ ἀκολοὐθω̨ R. Junta, Grynaeus, Brunck, recentiores.
H. omits οὐδ’, and so, with the excep­ tions aforesaid, do all the editions before Brunck:
though Le Fevre, Kuster, and Bergler supply it in their notes.
oM' ἀκολούθοις P1. οἰδ’ ἀλοίθω̨ F.594.
κοινὸν πα̑σιν Kuster, recentiores, save that Meineke and Holden write it ἄπασιν.
κοινὸν πα̑σι R. H. editions before Kuster.
πα̑σι (omitting κοινὸν) F. P1. Junta.
In the following line again the MSS.
and editions before Brunck have ἄπασι for ἄπασιν595.
σπελεθον and, in the following line, σπελεθω̄ν (variously accented) all the MSS., and all the editions except Bekker before Meineke;
but Bothe sug­ gested πέλεθον and πελεθω̑ν as in Ach.
1170, which Meineke and subsequent editors have introduced into the text, and so Bekker.
This alteration, I pre­ sume, is due to the statement of Moeris.
πέλεθον Ἀττικω̑ς, σπέλεθον Ἑλληι ικω̑ς, and to the strange notion that Ἑλληνικω̑ς means non-Attic, a notion refuted by every page of Moeris.—μου R. Pl. Le Fevre (in notes), Bentley, Brunck, re­ centiores, except Velsen who writes or.
pot H. F. editions before Brunck.596.
καὶ τω̄ν MSS.
Junta, Bergler, re­ centiores.
All other editions before Kuster omit the καὶ.
Bentley proposed τω̑ν yap or τω̑ν ovv, Kuster read τω̑ν δὲ.598.
τἀργύριον MSS. vulgo.
Under the erroneous supposition that Praxa­ gora is in this line dealing only with the land, Meineke changed τἀργύριον into τἀγροίκων, and in his Vind.
Aristoph.
proposes to change his own καὶ τἀγροί­ κων into πα̑ν τ’ἔγγειον, and τἄλλ’ into τἄργα.
No one has followed him, but Velsen changes τἀργύριον into σοὺς καρποὺς.603.
BA. κἄν, μὴ καταθεὶς, ψευδορκήοη ;
κἀκτήσατο γὰρ δμὶ τυυ̑το.
I have written this line a little differently to the MSS.
and preceding editors.
R. F. P1. con­ tinue the entire line to Praxagora, reading καὶ μὴ καταθεὶς ψευδορκήσει, κἀκ­ τήσατο yap διὰ του̑το.
And this reading has been followed by every editor, although the distribution of the speakers has varied.
H. and the editions before Bergk leave the first four words to Praxagora, and give the last four to Blepyrus, and so Blaydes.
Bergk and Meineke give the entire line to Ble­ pyrus.
Meanwhile Bentley had pro­ posed BA.
κἄνμὴ καταθη̑;
ΠΡ. ψευδορ­ κήσει, κἀκτήσατο γὰρ διὰ τοῖτο.
Tyrwhitt trisected the line, BA. καὶ μὴ καταθείς ;
ΠΡ.
ψευδορκήσει. BA. κἀκτήσατο γὰρ διὰ του̑το, and so Holden.
Meineke in his critical notes proposed to leave the first three words to Praxagora, and to give the last five to Blepyrus..
And this division is followed by Velsen.
I should have mentioned that P1. has ψευδομόσα for ψευδορκήσει, and that Blaydes changes the final του̑το into τουτί.605.
οὐδὶν F. P1. Fracini, Le Fevre (in notes), Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
οὐδ’ ἐν R. H. the other editions before Brunck.—πενήα̜ R. H. vulgo.
πνεύματι F. P1.615. εἰ πάντες.
No known MS. has this reading, but it was doubtless found in the MS.
or MSS.
from which Marco Musuro derived the text of Aldus, and has been followed by every editor of Aristophanes except those hereinafter mentioned, οὐ πάντες R. H. Fracini, Bekker,Bergk,Meineke,Velsen;
whilst Gelenius, Rapheleng, and Portus make οὐ or οὐ out of the οὐν and εἰ, or the οὐν and οὐ preceding πάντες.
πάντες γὰρ P1. F. has simply πάντες without either εὶ or οὐ.— ἵασιν R. H. vulgo.
ἵσασιν F. P1. Junta, Gormont.616. ἐπἰ τὴν MSS. vulgo, but P1. pre­ fixes
In .rou to the line.—καὶ ζητήσουσι R. Fracini, Gelenius, recentiores.
καὶ ζητοῡσιν H. and all editions (except Fracini) before Gelenius.
ζητοῡσιν (with­ out καὶ) F. P1.621-2. οὐχὶ μαχου̑νται ... ὑπάρξει.
These two lines have had a singular fate.
In all the editions before Brunck, line 621 disappeared entirely with the exception of the first two words, the copyist confusing them with the last two words:
thus, Aldus wrote — A new form was introduced by Fracini, who wrote — Fracini’s last five words were obviously a mere gloss on τοιου̑τον.
Then, to use Kuster's words, "Bisetus utramque lee­ tionem in unam quasi massam conflat, ut versum integrum reddat.
Bed quid multa ?
Expectandi sunt meliores codices, qui facem in his tenebris prae­ ferant.
Malta quidem, fateor, hie aria­ lari liceret;
led quis praestare possit, ea esse Aristophanis ? "
The good sense of Kuster's last words has been entirely ignored by subsequent critics, “ qui multa ubique ariolantur, quae esse Ari­ stophanis, nemo credeie potest."
The combined verse of which Kuster speaks is found in the editions which go by the name of Scaliger and Le Fevre.
These were the three types which, with inconsiderable variations (such as σου̑ for του̑ and ὑπάρχει for ίπάρξει), stood their ground until Brunch, from P1., introduced for the first time the two lines in their entirety.
It is not neces­ sary to go into the details of the earlier editions, and (with one or two excep­ tions) the readings given from the printed editions commence with Brunck.621.
περὶ σου̑ MSS.
Brunck changes this into περὶ του̑ ;
takes it from Praxa­ gora, and gives it to Blepyrus, as in the following line.
And he is followed by subsequent editors except Meineke and Velsen.
Dobree proposed μαχου̑νται, περὶ σου̑ θάρρει μὴ δείση̩ς, οὐχὶ μαχου̑νται Περὶ του̑ μή σοι ξυγκαταδαρθεῖν " omnia scilicet, Praxagorae.”
And so Meineke and (as regards 621) Velsen.
But H. has BA. before the second οὐχὶ μαχου̑νται.
And this seems right.622.
'repi roO ξυγκαταδαρθεῖν.
Here I have hit upon the same reading as Velsen.
The MSS.
read τοῦ μὴ καταδαρ­ θεῖν, and so Brunck and all subsequent editors except Meineke and Yelsen.
Both Bisetus and Dobree, as we have seen, and following them Meineke, attach περὶ τοῦ to ξυγκαταδαρθεῖν, but retain the μὴ, and Dobree and Meineke insert σοι.
But I think that the sense requires the omission of μὴ, and accord­ ingly, with Velsen, I have substituted περὶ TOL for TO?
μὴ. — κοὐ. καὶ MSS. vulgo. — ὑπάρξει H. Aldus, Zanetti, Farreus, Grynaeus, Scaliger, Le Fevre, Bergler, Bothe, Blaydes.
ύπάρχει R. F. Pl. Junta, Gormont, Brunck, and (except as afore­ said) recentiores.
The other editions before Brunck have Fracini's reading, in which the word does not occur.623.
ὑμέτερον R. F. Junta, Gormont, Bentley, Bergler, Dindorf, recentiores. ἡμέτερον H. P'. and (except as aforesaid) all editions before Dindorf, giving of course the sentence to Praxagora.
Here again, as at 495 supra and elsewhere, Brunck's unfair animadversion upon Bergler met with a speedy retribution.
"Mendose Junta," he says, “ ὑμέτερον, quod inepte revocavit Berglerus, non videns haec ex ipsa sententia mulieri continuari debcre."
Soon afterwards the Ravenna MS. and (as a matter of criticism) the supreme authority of Bentley were found to support the reading adopted by Bergler;
modern critics have no doubt of its accuracy;
and for my own part the words seem to me to be appropriate to Blepyrus only.
Praxagora could hardly have said that her plan for the women bad something to recommend it.
— τιν᾽ H. Brunck, recentiores.
τίν᾽ R. F. P1. editions before Brunck.
But the old editions understand the passage rightly enough.625.
φεύξονται MSS. vulgo.
Having regard to the form βαδιοῦνται at the end of the verse, Mr. R. J. Walker in Class.
Review, viii. 18, proposes to read φευξοῦν­ ται here.
But the probability is not sufficient to justify a change in the text.
— ἐπὶ τοὺς δὲ R. Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς H. F. P1. editions before Brunck.626.
οἱ φαυλότεροι MSS. vulgo.
αἱ φαυλότεραι Brunck, apparently per in­ curiam, since he does not mention the alteration in his notes, and retains of φαυλότεροι two lines below.
He is, however, followed by Bekker and Bothe.628.
This line is unfortunately omitted in F. P1.
οἱ φαυλότεροι, as two lines above, R. H. vulgo.
This cannot be right:
and two suggestions have been made for correcting it.
The first is Tyrwhitt's.
“Illud sane οἱ φαυλότεροι, quod in v. 628 secundo occurrit, et plane otiosum est, ab Aristophane profectum esse non possum credere.
Libenter igitur scriberem, stigmate post v. 627 posita;
Κοὐκ ἐξέσται παρὰ τοῖσι καλοῖς καὶ τοῖς μεγάλοις καταδαρθεῖν.”
- Tyrwhitt.
"Tyrwhitti conjecturam probat Por- Bonus apud Gaisfordium ad Marklandi Supplices p. 206.”
- Elmsley
The τοῖς μεγάλοις is introduced by way of contrast to τοῖς μικροῖς in the following verse;
but it is not a likely expression in itself, nor is τοῖς μικροῖς free from suspicion.
I, like others before me, think that the allusion to Lysicrates in line 630 makes it probable that in line 629 we should read σιμοῖς for μικροῖς.
And if we look to lines 701-705 infra to see who are there contrasted with τοῖς σιμοῖς καὶ τοῖς αῖσχροῖς, we light upon τοῖς εὐπρεπέσιν.
So that, following Tyrwhitt's lead, we might read here:
The second suggestion is by Hirschig, who would omit the words καὶ τηρήσουσ᾽ ἐπὶ τοῖσιν δημοσίοισιν οἱ φαυλότερ
οι as a gloss, and read ἀπό τοῦ δείπνου, κοὐκ 'flarat πapa τοῖσι καλοῖς καταδαρθεῖν.
This also seems to me very probable.
On the whole, however, I have thought it better to retain the lines unaltered, merely, with Dindorf and Bergk, en­ closing the second οἱ φαυλότεροι in brackets.
Velsen omits them, marking a lacuna.
Meineke gives them to Ble­ pyrus, placing after them a note of interrogation:
but they would surely make a very unmeaning question in his mouth.
Blaydes adopts Tyrwhitt's suggestion.
I had not observed that Blaydes also suggests for καὶ ToP, μεγά­ λοις either καὶ τοῖς σεμνοῖς or τοῖς r' εὐπρεπέσιν.629.
ταῖσι γυναιξὶ πρὶν ἆν Meineke, Blaydes, Velsen, following the views of Elmsley at Medea 215.
ταῖσι γυναιξὶν πρὶν R. P1. Bergler, and (except as aforesaid) recentiores.
ταῖς γυναιξὶν πρὶν H. F. Aldus, Junta. ταῖς γυναιξὶ πρὶν the other editions before Kuster.
ταῖσι γυ­ ναιξὶ πρὶν Le Fevre (in notes), Kuster.— μικροῖς R. H. F. vulgo.
μικρο ῖσ σι P1. σιμοῖς was suggested by Lennep and Bergk, and is read by Velsen.— χαρίσων­ ται H. vulgo.
χαρίσοντα ι R. χαρί F. χωρὶς Pl. "auctore Porsono legendum χαρίσασθαι,” Elmsley in his note to Tyrwhitt partly quoted on the preceding verse.
And so Reisig, and Elmsley him­ self on Medea 215.633.
This line, again, is omitted in F. P1.
ἐμβάδ᾽ ἔχων R. Invernizii, recentiores, except as hereinafter mentioned.
ἐμβἀδ᾽ (without ἔχων) H. ἐμβάδι γ᾽ editions before Brunck.
ἐμβὰς δή γ᾽ Le Fevre (in notes), Brunck.
Before the true reading was known Bentley jot ted down “ Forte propria nomina sub illis latent Οταν ᾽Εμβαδίᾳ y' εἴπη Πρότερος ” ;
and in a note on Hesychius, ᾽Εμβάδιον• παὶζει ἐπὶ τούτῳ, Heinsius had written "vide Aristoph. in loco corrupto Eccles. 633.”
These suggestions are superseded by the discovery of R.'s reading yet Meineke, reverting to them, introduces ᾽Εμβαδίων into the text, and is followed by Velsen.
—πportρῳ Le Fevre (in notes), Brunck, Bekker, Velsen.
πρότερ
ος R. H. vulgo.638. ἐξῆς R. H. F. vulgo.
The word is omitted in P1.—τότε carra. τὸν πάντα MSS. vulgo.
The τὸν is quite out of place, and Blaydes writes πάντ᾽ ὄντα, which makes a strange jingle with γέροντα ;
while Velsen removes ἄγξουσ᾽ from its place in the line, and wrote ἄγξουσιν after τότε seems a simpler alteration.
639.
ὄντα R. F. P1. Fracini, Gelenius, recentiores.
ἔοντα H. Aldus, Junta, and the other editions before Gelenius.643.
τὸν ἐκείνου, Be. πατέρα, that is the father of the intervener.
This seems to me the right reading, giving the right meaning.
I have no doubt that Le Fevre supposed his suggestion τὸν ἔαυτοῦ would mean the same thing, but it would really mean the father of the striker, and was rightly condemned by Bentley.
αὐτὸν ἐκεῖνον MSS. vulgo.
αὑτοῦ κεῖνον Bothe. αὐτὸν κεῖνος Bergk.—τ ύπτη H. F. vulgo. τύψη P1. τύπτει R. — δρῶσιν Kuster, recentiores.

Λευκόλοφος. Λευκολόφος R. Fracini, and all subsequent editions before Kuster.
Λευκολόφας H. F. P1. Aldus and Junta.
Kuster silently restored the reading of Aldus, which has since been followed.—πάππαν (as elsewhere in Ari­ stophanes) Brunck, recentiores.
πάπαν MSS. editions before Brunck.—καλεῖ R. F. P1. Junta, recentiores, except as hereafter mentioned.
καλῆ H. Aldus. καλοῖ Brunck, Dindorf, Bergk.647. φιλήσειεν R. H. vulgo.
φιλήσει F. P1.—αὑτοῦ Bekker, recentiores.
αὐτοῦ MSS. editions before Bekker.
Mehler suggests σ᾽ αὑτοῦ.
Bergk says "
Malim αὑτὸν,” but this is probably only de­ signed to support his own ridiculous suggestion, that this degraded Aristyllus is meant for the great and noble philo­ sopher, some of whose theories the poet is here engaged in caricaturing, a sug­ gestion so irrational, that I should not have thought it worthy of mention, had not Mr. Browning been deluded into taking it seriously, and introducing it into the poem which he calls “Ari­ stophanes᾽ Apology."648.
γ᾽ ἄν R. F. P1. vulgo. μ᾽ άν H. Aldus. τἄν (probably Bentley, though in the Classical Journal his marginal note is given as τν ἄν) Lenting, Cobet (N. L. 60), Bergk, Meineke, Blaydes, Velsen.
But the particle γ᾽ seems re­ quired—
If he kiss me, he shall at all events smart for it.650.
δέος μὴ R. H. vulgo. δέος οὐ μὴ F. P1. Junta, Gormont.—φελήση R.H. IF.
vulgo.
φιλήσει P1.—ἐπεπόνθειν R. F. P1. Kuster, Bergler, Bergk. ἐπεπόνθην H. editions before Kuster.
Bentley saw that this would not do, and wrote " Lege ἐπεπόνθειν vel -θη Attice."
Of course he was well aware that either form was equally correct, but Brunck, a great offender in substituting the forms which were used by the Athenians only, for those which were used by the Athenians in common with the other Hellenic peoples, wrote ἐπεπόνθη in defiance of all the MSS.
and (save as aforesaid) has been followed by subsequent editors.652.
λιπαρῷ Bentley (referring to Plutus 616), Bothe, recentiores.
λιπαρῶς R. H. F. edd. before Bothe, except Brunck and Bekker, who with P1. read λιπαρὸν, a very probable reading, as an epithet of δεῖπνοι'.655.
η̃ντις R. vulgo.
η̃τις F. ει̃ τις B. ο̃ταν P1.—τῳ R. H. vulgo.
The old editions write it τῷ but this was cor­ rected by Bentley and Bergler.
τῶν F. τις P1.656. ἐκίσει H. F. P1. vulgo.
κτίσηR.­ οὐ γὰρ τῶν κοινῶν γ'ἐστὶ MSS.
vulgo.
Not realizing that some such preposition as ἐκ is to be understood from the pre­ ceding πόθεν, some critics have endea­ voured to introduce ἐκ here.
Blaydes says " οὐ γὰρ δὴ 'κ τῶν κοινῶν γε Cobet.
Quod recipiendum duxi."
He then pro­ pounds three conjectures of his own.
(1) οὐ δὴ 'κ τῶν κοινῶν γ'ἐστὶ. (2) οὐκ ἐκ τῶν κοινῶν γ'In:
. (3) ἐκ γὰρ τῶν κοινῶν γ'οὐχὶ.
His third conjecture he intro­ duces into the text;
and so, with the change of ἐκ into ἀπὸ, Velsen.657.
δίκαι R. H. vulgo.
δίκαια F. P1.­ τουτὶ δὲ πύσυς Le Fevre (in notes), Kuster, recentiores, except as hereafter mentioned.
τουτὶ πόσους editions before Kuster, except that Junta has toti πόσ'.
Bentley suggested τουτί γε πόσους or τοιτί γ'όπόσους. The MS.
readings are τουτὶ πόσσ' H. F. τουτὶπάλιν P'. τοντί τ' οῦπος R.
This last reading looks very like τουτὶ του̃πος, and Meineke accord­ ingly reads τουτὶ του̃π
ος σ', in which he is followed by Holden and Velsen.
Between these two readings τουτὶ δι πόσους and τουτὶ του̃π
ος σε, it is very difficult to decide.
The latter comes nearer to the MSS., and the rejoinder of Chremes, which immediately follows, is perhaps more suitable to a definite statement made than to a question put by the preceding speaker, though the question sufficiently indicates the speaker's opinion.
On the other hand the former reading is far more in the tone which Blepyrus has assumed throughout the dialogue, and is just like his interruption in 562 supra.
And on the whole, though with great hesita­ tion, I have thought it best to retain it.
Blaydes reads Toti δέγ'υ̃σους.659. ένὸς ει̃νεκα MSS. vulgo.
ένὸς ου̃εκα Brunck, Invernizzi, Dindorf, Meineke, Holden.
Meineke is so resolute in his determination to keep Aristophanes to one form that he actually changes ε̃νεκενιn the earlier part of the line to υυ̃νεκα.662.
εὐσε διδάσκει.
The reason for this reading is given in the Commen­ tary.
εὐ γε διδάσκεις MSS. vulgo.663.
τῆς αἰκείας R. Bekker, Blaydes.
And this is the form which both Dawes (ad loc.) and Elmsley prefer. " Scri­ bendum αι̃κεια," says the latter critic on Soph.
Oed. Col. 748, " ostendit ana­ logia.
Substantiva omnia ab adjectiris in -ὴς derivata, aut εἰ dipthongum at εὐσέβεια aut correptum ut ἀμθια, in penultima habent apud Atticos.
Recte igitur ἀεἰκεια ab ἀεικὴς, αι̃κεια ab αἰκής." τὴς αἰκίας H. F. P1. vulgo.
But the geni­ tive has offended some, and Dawes pro­ posed τὰς αἰκείας.
The genitive, how­ ever, appears to depend upon some such word as τὴντιμὴν, or τὸ τίμημα, understood after ἐκτίσουσιν.
Others have objected to the article τῆς. " Vix puto articulum unquam addi in alIaS' υ̃βρεως, etc., δίκη," says Dobree, and he there­ fore proposes τὴν αἰκίας, which is intro­ duced into the text by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.
But Dobree's remark that you would always say υ̃βρεως δίκη not τῆς υ̃βρεως δίκη, and the like, though true, seems quite irrelevant here;
where the meaning is that "they who strike others will pay the penalty of their assault," not " will have an action of assault brought against them."

ὑβρίξουσι F. Junta, Gormont.666. ὐθις R. Invernizzi, recentiores.
The word is omitted by U. F. P'. and all the editions before Invernizzi.
To sup­ ply the missing foot, Le Fevre proposed to insert έξῆς before ὑβριεῖται and Kuster πώποτε before Φαύλως.
Bentley and Tyrwhitt proposed οὐδεὶς after , and Brunck so read.667.
κλέψει πετὸν αὐτῷ Brunck, recen­ tiores.
All the editions before Bergler read κλέψαιμι τὸ 'μαυτου̅. Kuster observed that this was not in accordance with Attic usage.
"Nam Attici," he said, non solent vocabulum ε post articulum TO elidere, sed potius per crasin duas illas syllabas in unam contrahere, dicentes τοὐμαυτοῦ, ut τυὐμὸν pro TO ἐμὸν, του̃πος for TO ε̃πος et sexcenties alia..
It He there - fore proposed a reading which he found in Suidas (to which Bentley had already called attention) κλέψαι, μετὸναὐτῷ.
And Bergler so reads.
And this is found to be the reading of all the MSS.
But both Brunck and Parson pointed out that the true reading must be and this is universally accepted.
669.
οὐὂ ἣνγε... πρότερ
ον.
These words are taken from Praxagora and given to Blepyrus (as a question) by Dobree, Meineke.
Holden, and Velsen.
But this is a change for the worse.
It leaves Praxagora's speech a mere pointless jest:
and the ω̃σπερ πρότερον is quite in her style, as supra 609.
For θύραζ' (MSS. vulgo), Meineke and Holden write θύρασ', I know not why.670.
δώσει. Bergk proposes δώσεις, which Meineke reads.
The alteration must have occurred to everybody, but the third person is more in accord with what follows.672. κυβεύσουσ' R. H. F. vulgo.
κυβεύ­ σουσιν Pl. Brunck, Bothe.
This is doubtless a correction by P1. to save the metre, since H. F. P1. and all editions before Invernizzi read But Inver.
nizzi and all subsequent editors have ἀρ'.
Both Invernizzi and Bekker attribute this reading to R., and I think that this must be right, for Invernizzi could not have invented it himself.
In 668 they attribute ἂρα to R. as well as the other MSS.
On the other hand, Velsen flays that R. reads ἀρα in 668, and that with this exception all the MSS.
read α̃ρα both in 668 and 672.
Velsen is a most careful and excellent transcriber, but in this case I think that he must be wrong.—ἄνθρωποι MSS. rulgo.
ἄνθρωποι Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
But the article seems quite out of place here.675.
εὶς ἀλλήλους R. P1. Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk. Dindorf suggested εἰς ὰλλήλων, which is read by Meineke and Holden.
ώς ἀλλήλους H. F. vulgo.
But the ὥστε and ὠς, so close together, would be very inhar­ monious.
684.

Brunck, knowing no MS.

And one would certainly have expected Praxa­ gora's emphatic "

ὅτο R. ὅταν P1.
The true arrangement of this linewas first pointed out by Bentley and Tyrwhitt.

εὐωχῆσθε H.F.P1. vulgo.
εὐωχεῖσθε R.—σήμερον MSS. edd. before Brunck. τήμερον Brunck, Bekker, recentiores.
This is, of course, Brunck's constant fallacy of changing the Atticum into the magis Atticum.
He acknowledges that σήμερον is bene, but thinks it minus bene than τήμερον.720.
ωσιν αὑται R. H. P1. vulgo.
ἔχωσι αὐται F. αὑται means the women who form the Chorus.
Not understand­ ing this, Brunck altered the words into ἔχωμεν αὐταὶ, which is followed by Invernizzi.
And indeed Scaliger had previously suggested ἔχωμεν.
Invernizzi, however, in his note ("incredibili sagaci­ tate," says Dindorf in his notes to that edition) suggested μὴ ‘χωσιν which Bothe adopts, with αὐταί.
Bergk has ἔχωσιν αὐταί.724.

The other MSS.
have no trace of a Chorus, but Brunck rightly thought that a Choral Ode must have dropped out somewhere, and un­ fortunately fixed its place two lines above, after θαυμάζετε.
This, indeed, was his reason for changing ἐγὼ δ’ into ἔγωγ’.
Still more unfortunately, when the Ravenna MS. was discovered, Din­ dorf removed XOPOY from this place, where it is absolutely required, to the very unsuitable place which Brunck had guessed for it.
And so Blaydes.733. στρέψασ’ F. P1. Le Fevre (in notes), Kuster, recentiores, except as hereinafter mentioned.

The ellipse of the words " icould you be more black,” is no doubt very strange.
Bentley proposed οὺδαμῶς, or οὐ γὰρ ἣ, or ov γὰρ οὐν.
Dobree in his note on Porson's Plutus 886, sus­ pected that a line had dropped out, but in his Addenda to that note, ob­ served that the ellipse might be defended by Lysistrata 307, οὐκοῦν ἄν, εἰ τὼ μὲν ξύλω κ.τ.λ.
In his own Adversaria, published after his death, he again advances the theory of a lost line.
Halbertsma proposed ὠς ἃν εἰ which is adopted by Bergk, Blaydes, and Velsen.
Meineke reads οἰ’ἂνεἰ, which is followed by Holden.737.
ἴθ ἡ MSS.

Meineke conjectured λαχὼν, which seems in every way an alteration for the worse, but Blaydes and Velsen adopt it.743.
θαλλοὺς καθίστη MSS.
Grynaeus, Brunck, recentiores.
θαλλοὺς καὶ καθίστη editions (except Grynaeus) before Brunck.
They make 743 a complete sentence, " bring the olive branches and set them here," placing a colon after 742, and leaving the words τὰ κηρία to shift for themselves.
Le Fevre and Bentley saw that κόμιζε referred to ra κηρία and proposed καὶ θαλλοὐς καθίστη, but the MS.
reading removes all diffi­ culty.744.
τὼ τρίποδ’ R. F. vulgo. τὼ τρίδ’ H. Aldus, Junta τὀν τρίποδ’ P1. Zanetti and Farreus have τρίποδ’ omitting the τὼ.746.
ANHP P1. gives no name to the new comer;
but the other MSS.
and most of the early editions call him ἀνὴρ or ἄλλος φειδωλὸς, a niggard.
This is so obviously a misdescription, that later editors changed the name into ANHP B.
At last Beer came out with a fatuous suggestion that this restive and turbulent fellow is none other than the patient Chremes, with whom he has not one single characteristic in common, and Meineke and Holden actually give him that name in their editions.747.
ἀνὴρ ἔσομαι MSS.
Junta, Gor­ mont, Grynaeus, Brunck, recentiores.
All the other editions before Brunck omit ἀνὴρ, no doubt because they mis­ took it for the speaker's name ;
indeed, Zanetti and Farreus preserve ὰν. in that capacity.
Scaliger suggested νὴ Δι’, which Kuster and (apparently) Bergler approved, but did not adopt.

But all have ἀποφέρειν two lines below.761.
πῶς;
ρ́ᾳθίως MSS.
vulgo.
For πῶς we should rather have expected ὄπως, and ῥα̣δίως is not very suitable to the context;
but none of the attempts to improve the text have been satis­ factory, and we must needs take it as it stands.
Bergk's suggestion is A. κακο­ ὸαίμων ὰρεῖς;
B. νὴ τὸν Δία τὸν σωτῆρ᾽ ἀποίσω.
A. δαιμοᾷς.
Meineke would add another line, A. πῶς;
B. εἰ ῥᾳδίως αὐτὸς τὰ carrot χρήματ᾽ ἀποβαλεῖς τάλαν.
Holden transposes several lines in the text, making them run thus-A. μὰ Δῖ ἀλλ᾽ ἀποφέρειν αὐτὰ μέλλω τῇ πόλει.
B. μέλλεις ἀποφέρειν;
A. πἀνυ yt. B. πῶς ;
σωτήρα, κακοδαίμων άρ' εί, whilst Velsen, marking a lacuna in the text, proposes A. ο̃πως ;
on Μέλλεις ἀπιφίρειν ταῦτά y οὔτω ῥᾳδίως.767.
TO ταττόμενον H. F. P'. and almost all the old editions give the two lines from ῖτι τὸ ταττόμενον to μάλιστα πάντων, to the first citizen (Chremes).
Tyrwhitt restored the humour of the passage by giving line 767 to the second citizen (the husband of the Second Woman);
and he is followed by Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, and all subsequent editors.
In fact, however, R. has its mark for a new speaker here, and Fracini, Gelenius, and Rapheleng, all distribute the lines as Tyrwhitt does.772.
ἐπειθόμην MSS. vulgo.
As, ἐπιθό­ μην Brunck.
πεισθήσομαι Blaydes.773.
λέξουσι all printed editions.
λέ­ γουσι MSS.
The last word of these and the three following lines is changed by Brunck from γὰρ into γοῦν, an altera­ tion which is no improvement, and has found no acceptance.775.
πἀντ᾽ all printed editions.
πάντα R. H.
The word is omitted by F., and σύ γε is substituted by P1.
For ἀπολεῖς Reiske suggests ἀπόλοι᾽.776.
ὁ Zεὐς σέ y MSS.
Brunck, re­ centiores.
6 Zεύς σ᾽ editions before Brunck, except Fracini, who omits σέ γ᾽ altogether.
— ἐπιτρίψοσι MSS.
vulgo.
ἐπιτρίψειε crept into the text of Gelenius, and held its place in all subsequent editions before Brunck.780.
χειρῶ γε τῶν ὰγαλμάτων so R. (except that for γε it had τε).
In­ vernizzi followed R., but Reiske sug­ gested yt, and this is adopted by Bekker, Dindorf, and all subsequent editors.
χειρῶν τε is in fact the reading of all the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck.
The readings before the dis­ covery of R. for τῶν ἀγαλμάτων were very perplexing.
και τἀγάλματα F. P1. Junta, Gormont, Grynaeus, and Brunck, the latter, however, changing the pre­ ceding τε into γε. καὶ [ἀγάλματα] (the latter word in brackets) Portus and subsequent editors before Brunck.
καὶ τἀγαλμάτων Zanetti, Farreus, and Raphe­ leng. καὶ (omitting ἀγαλματα) and so leaving the line too short by an iambic dipody H. Aldus, Fracini, and Gele­ nius.789.
ri δρᾶν R. F. P1. Gelenius, Portus, recentiores. τί δρᾶς H. and the other editions before Portus.
But I am not sure about Fracini, in whose edition, or at least in my copy of it, the final letter is very indistinct.795.
καταθείην Brunck, Dindorf,Bergk, recentiores.
καταθείμην MSS. and the other editions.—μὴ γὰρ οὐ λάβοις ὅποι • MSS.
and all editions before Meineke.
μὴ γὰρ οὐ λάβῃς ὅποι Heindorf (note on Phaedo), Meineke, Holden, and Velsen.

(1) that which he has introduced into the text, ὄπου having been previously suggested by Lenting, and λάβῃς by Heindorf;
(2) μὴ γὰρ οὐχ Professor Palmer, in the essay to which reference has been made more than once, is so certain of his own emenda­ tion that it is only fair to gire his own words.
"
We conceive we have dis­ covered the true reading and explanation beyond all controversy.
Citizen
A is hasting to comply with the decree of the women that all property must be collected in a common store, and is removing all his household goods to deposit them in the appointed place.
Citizen
B is a mocker, and tells him there is no hurry, that the men are likely to repent of having committed the city to the women.
A says in the passage before us, ‘I'd be in a nice fix if I couldn't find a place to deposit my goods in,' thinking every one will be in such a hurry to obey the decree, that all available space in the agora will be taken up.
To which Citizen B the mocker replies, if our view of the passage be right, It would be more reasonable to fear you would not find room to throw them, μὴ γὰρ οὐ βάλοις ὄποι. θάρρει, καταθήσεις κἀν ἔνης ἔλθῃς.
You will find you will have space to put them down the day after to-morrow, never fear!
At present it would be more reasonable to fear there will not be room enough in the agora to throw them about, 158 Quarterly Review, 370.
To me this suggestion seems most improbable.796.
ἔνης MSS.
vulgo.
ἔνην Brunck, under the impression that the word was so written in his only MS.
P1. :
but according to Velsen ε̄νης is found in P1. as well as in R. H. F.799.
οīσουσιν MSS. vulgo.
κομιου̑σιν Velsen.— κομίσωσι.
For this word Tyr­ whitt proposed οἲσωσι, on which Elmsley remarks, " Miror Tyrwhittum μὴ οἲσωσι potius quam μὴ 'νέγκωσι scripsisse."
I do not understand that Elmsley pro­ posed to read 'νέγκωσι, but Dr. Blaydes introduces it into the text.802. ἃπειμ' έάσας vulgo.
Tyrwhitt suggested ἃπει μ'ὲάσας, which is adopted by Bergk and Velsen.
The line is omitted in F. P1., and the letters and accents being identical, it is impossible to say whether R. H. (and perhaps Aldus) read ἃπειμ' έάσας or ἃπει μ' ὲάσας.
—κωλίσωσι so I think we should read for the unmeaning πωλω̑σ' αὺτὰ of the MSS.
and editions.

At the commence­ ment of the line Meineke proposes to change the αῡτ' εἰσενέγκοι of the MSS.
and editions into αὺτοἲς ἐνέγκοι, and the change is made by Blaydes and Velsen.810.
πλείω R. H. Aldus, Fracini, Gele­ nius, and all subsequent editors before Brunck, and afterwards Dindorf, Bergk, and all subsequent editors except Blaydes, who reads πλεȋν γε. πλεȋον P1. and (altered from πλείω) F. and all other editors.
In H. F. P'. and all editions before Dindorf the entire line was continued to the same speaker;
but R. has the sign of a new speaker before πλείω, and the line is divided as in the text by Dindorf, Bergk, and all subse­ quent editors.

έστω̄σ' (id est, έστω̄σαι) H. edi­ tions before Brunck. ίστα̑σ' P1. ίστα̑σίτ' Brunck, Invernizzi.
Thus, before Dawes, the reading was κρατη̑ρα συγκιρνα̑σιν at μυροπώλιδες 'Εστω̑σ' έφεξη̑ς "Poculum temperant unguentariae mulieres, or­ dine stantes " Le Fevre.
Dawes in his note on Wasps 576, lays down the rule podis Atticis non licuisse ullum diph­ thongum elidere, and in proceeding to prove it, comes to the present passage, and observes, " Unicusne obsecro crater satis erat quo se invitarent universi cives Athenienses ?
Nam omnes vocati erant.
Profecto si cui forte lectio vul­ gata adrideat, ab eo cognoscere impense velim, prime quanta cmteris magnitudo;

Person (at Orestes 1645) after discussing Dawes's suggestion proposes κρατη̑ρας οὒς κιρνα̑­ σιν a!
μυροπώλιδες 'Εστα̑σ' έφεξη̑ς, and Bekker adopts this in its entirety.
But all subsequent editors have kept the μυροπώλιδες from the wine-cups;
and treat κρατη̑ρας έγκιονα̑σιν as one sen­ tence, and a! μυροπώλιδες έστα̑σ' έφεξη̑ς as another.844. φρύγεται R. Scaliger (in notes), Brunck, recentiores.
φρύγονται H. F. and all editions before Brunck, though both Kuster and Bergler in their notes agreed with Scaliger.

κονίποδα MSS. vulgo.
κονίποδας Brunck (" Poterat etiam κονίποδε " observes Dindorf), Meineke, Holden, whilst Blaydes adopts Dindorf's observa­ tieD and reads κοιίποδε.
The singular is clearly right;
to the χλανίδα and κονίποδα here the έμβἀς (in the singular) and τρίβων answer two lines below.
If any change were required, we should adopt the plural, since we far more commonly find Λακωνικἀς, Περσικἀς, έμ­ βἀδας and the like, than the dual.
Dr. Blaydes refers to 633 supra έμβάδ' έχων, but there έμβάδ' is probably the singular, as here, and not the dual.
The Γέρων at the commencement of the line was formerly written γέρων, but Dindorf, observing that it is found as a proper name in inscriptions, wrote it with a capital r, and so all recent editors.849.
καχάζων MSS. Pierson (at Moeris, s. v. κακκαχεȋν), Brunck, recen­ tiores.

The ό is omitted in the other editions before Portus, most of whom also, in the following line, have τἀ γνάθους for τἀς γνάθους.855.
μὴ καταθεἰς.
Hence H. and several editors generally give the speeches of Chremes to ό καταθεἰς, and the speeches of the second speaker to 6 μὴ καταθεἰς.
Here, however, and to the end of line 866 all the speeches of Cbremes are attributed to the κη̑ρυξ.859. ε̃θ’ H. F. P1. vulgo. εἰθ’ R. 860. ο̃μως R. F. P1. Junta, Gormont, Portus, recentiores.

See the Commentary.876. όμόσ’ R. H. vulgo. ὀμοσ’ P1. ὁ μὸς F. After this line R. has XOPOY as after 729, and so Bergk, recentiores.
The other MSS.
omit XOPOY, and so all editions before Bergk, except that Brunck prints in his text at this place λείπει ή του̑ Χορου̑ ω̨̉.884.
MEl PAS.
The speaker is called by R. and H. ἅλλη νέα. F. and P1. give her no name.
In the earliest editions she is simply called AA (ἅλλη) which degenerated into ἅλλη γραυ̑ς;
and this is found even in Kuster and Bergler, though in his notes Bergler points out that the speaker is a girl.
Brunck gives NE’ both for the girl and for the youth who presently enters and talks to her, which is of course very confusing.
Invemizzi and most recent editors have ΝΕΑΝΙΣ in full for the girl, and NEANIAS in full for the youth;
but even this is somewhat perplexing;
and I have borrowed the word which Aristo­ phanes himself uses, supra 696, in the foreshadowing of the present scene, viz.
μεȋραξ, leaving νεανίας for the youth.890.
κὰποχώρησον R. Le Fevre (in notes), Brunck (in notes), Bekker, re­ centiores.
κἀπιχώρησον H. F. P1. edd. before Bekker, except that Junta has χηπἀκώρησον.
For τούτω̣ at the com­ mencement of the line, Meineke ludi­ crously reads τύμβω̣.
Halbertsma con­ jectured σαιτη̣̄, which Blaydes introduces into the text.891.
φιλοττύριον. “Vox nihili," says Dr. Blaydes, who gives six conjectures of his own:
(1) φίλε νοττάριον, (2) & νοττάριον, (3) φιλε παιδἀριον, (4) φίλε νηττάριον, (5) φίλε φαττάριον, (6) μελιτ­ τάριον.
But φιλοττάριον is a made-up word of endearment, like the amicellule by which Le Fevre translates it.894.
χρὴ καθεύδειν R. H. vulgo.
These two words are omitted by F. P1.897.
οὐδέ rot R. H. F. all editions before Rapheleng.
οὐδέ τις P1. Ra­ pheleng and all subsequent editions except Velsen.
τις seems to destroy the meaning of the passage, for the speaker is not contrasting herself with other women of her own age, but only with young people like the μεȋραξ.
Velsen reads οὐδέ rot, but having got rid of the obnoxious τις actually reinserts it before ἐθέλοι in the place of ἀν, which he transfers to the next line between φίλον and ῷπερ.
Rapheleng seems to have introduced the word by a clerical error.898.
φίλον γ’ Dindorf (in notes), Meineke, Blaydes. φίλον MSS.vulgo:
but after φίλον H. has ἡ via, doubtless from a marginal gloss.
-The metre requires a long syllable or two short syllables in place of the -ον in φίλον, and Dindorf's way of providing for the want seems the best.
Dobree suggests φίλον ὅτω̨ περ which Blaydes adopts.
Bergk reads τῶν φίλων, which is quite unsuitable.
I have also followed the division of the lines suggested by Dindorf in his ' Metra Aeschyli, etc."900.
ταȋσιν R. Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Bergk, Velsen.
ταȋσι H. F. P1. edd. before Brunck.
In order to bring the line into metrical harmony with 906 infra, Dindorf changed ταȋσιν into ταȋς, and he is followed by Bothe, Meineke, and Blaydes.
But the error, if any, is in line 906.901.
ἐμπέφυκε MSS. vulgo.
In order to bring the line into syllabic uniformity with 907 infra Meineke suggests and Blaydes reads ἐπιπέφυκε, but of course syllabic uniformity is not required in trochaics.906.
ἐκπέσοι yi.
I have inserted γε for the sake of the metre, and so, I ob­ serve, Bergk also suggested.
ἐκπέσοι (without γε) MSS.
vulgo.
ἐκπέσοι πού Velsen.—σου R. H. F. and (as corrected) P1. vulgo.
σοι (before correction) P1. Velsen.909.
ὄφιν.
If the strophe is correct, a foot has fallen out after ὄφιν, and another in the following line.
For the first vacancy Bergk proposed ψυχρὸν, which is adopted by Blaydes and Velsen.
For the second Blaydes inserts σαυτη̣̑ at the end, and Velsen τινὰ σὺ at the beginning of the line.
I have inserted ψυχρὸν and σαυτη̣̑ in brackets, not as thinking that they are the words of Aristophanes, but to make the metre clear to the reader.911.
αἰ a?
MSS. and all editions be­ fore Dindorf.
Dindorf, relying on the authority of Herodian Περὶ Μονήρους Αέξεως, here as elsewhere, changes the reading of all the MSS.
into αἰαȋ, and he is followed by the subsequent editors.
For my part I prefer to rely on the authority of the MSS.
and the far superior beauty of their reading.
­ πείσομαι R. H. vulgo.
πειράσομαι F. P1.— μοὐταȋρ
ος R. Invernizzi, recentiores.
μον τοὐρ
ος H. F. Pl. all editions before Brunck.
This Andrea Divo translated non venit mihi urina.
And this transla­ tion was retained till Brunck.
Le Fevre, however, suggested ταυ̑ρ
ος for τοὐρος, but was not satisfied with his own sugges­ tion.
ταυ̑ρ
ος was again suggested by Bergler (referring to Lysistrata 217), and it was introduced into the text by Brunck, who changed the translation into non venit mihi taurus.
Here, as so frequently elsewhere, the Ravenna MS, has solved the difficulty.914.
καὶ τἄλλα μ’ ούδὲν
To μετὰ ταυ̑τα Dobree, Velsen. καὶ τἄλλ’ οὐδέν με ταυ̑τα H. vulgo. καὶ τἄλλ’ οὐδὲν pra ταυ̑τα R. F. P1. Junta, Gormont, Brunck, In­ vernizzi, Bekker, Bothe, and Blaydes.
The words δεȋ λέγειν are omitted in F. P1. and by Brunck, but are found in R. H. and all other editions.
Bergk brings βέβηκε into the line and reads βέβηκε, κἆ̣—ἀλλ’ oC με ταυ̑τα δεȋ λέγειν :
whilst Meineke has βέβηκε, καίτοι τἄλλα γ’ οὐδὲν at!
λέγειν, which was Hermann's conjecture.916.
ὅπως MSS. vulgo.
Le Fevre suggested ου̑τως, which is adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Bothe.
It is of course the word we should have ex­ pected, but it does not suit the supposed metre.924. παράκυφθ’ R. F. Le Fevre (in notes), Elmsley (at Tyrwhitt), Bekker, recentiores.
παράκυφ’ P1. editions before Brunck. παράκυφρ’ H. Brunck ("cui fraudi fuit MS. sui scriptum ὡς γαλη̑,” says Elmsley ubi supr.) read παράκυψον, and so Invernizzi.—ὥσπερ R. H. vulgo.
F. P. Junta, Gormont, Brunck, Invernizzi.988.
δόξει γε καὶ σοί R. F. P1. Junta, Bekker, and so, but with δόξη for δόξει, H.
This seems perfectly right.
It shall appear so ereM to yourself;
for he will quickly come to me.
Unfortunately Aldus wrote δείξει, taking it probably from three lines below:
and this mistake has, except as aforesaid, travelled down through every edition.
It is most un­ likely that Aristophanes should have written δείξει in both lines.
Blaydes offers six emendations:
(1) δείξει γέ τοί σοι, (2) δείξει τάχ αὺτό, (8) δείξει τάχ’ αὐτός, (4) δείξεινε̃οικε, (5) δείξει γε μέντοι, (6) δείξει ye του̃ργον;
but winds up by saying, “sed cf. Soph. Oed. R. 1294 δείξει δὲ καὶ σοί.”—εἰσιν H. F. P1. vulgo.
εὶσὶν R.935. φθίνυλλα R. F. P1. vulgo, save that two or three of the earlier editions spell it φθίνιλλα.
Φίνυλλα H.
For the σύ at the end of the line Bergk con­ jectures σοὶ, which, I presume, he would attach to the δείξει which immediately follows.939.

Bothe's alteration is no doubt correct, though the reason he gives (viz. that the metre requires it) is wrong, since the last syllable of the third line in the Scolium may be either long or short.945.

H. and all editions, except Junta and Grynaeus, before Brunck.

Brunck, misled by his faulty MS., intro­ duced δράσει, and has been followed by all subsequent editors.949.
ἐξηπάτησα MSS. vulgo.
ἐξηπάτηκα Blaydes.
But the meaning seems to be I took her in by affecting to retire, supra 936.950. μένειν (present) MSS.

This is given once only by Junta and Gormont both here and in 960 infra.
—φίλον ἐμὸν R. H. vulgo. φίλον ἐμοὶ F. P1.953. ξύνευνός μοι MSS. vulgo.
The μοι is omitted by Bothe, Meineke, Blaydes, and Velsen, but Bothe replaces it after ε̃σει.
Bergk reads ξύνευνέ pot.966. ποίησον τήνδ’ R. F. P1. vulgo.
ποίησον τὴν H. Aldus only.
ποίηον τόνδ’ (as in strophe) Gelenius.968-975.
In all the MSS., and in all the editions before Bergk, these eight lines are continued to the youth:
and that they are rightly so continued is plain, as well from their general tenor, as from the word ἄνοιξον.
Hermann .
committed the unaccountable mistake of transferring the first quatrain to the girl, a mistake which has crept through all subsequent editions.
This of course required an alteration in ἄνοιξν, for which Hermann proposed ἄρηξον which is meaningless, and Velsen reads ἄνελθε.
which is cruel:
for the youth could not come up till she had opened the door.

And so all MSS.

Bentley jotted down on the margin of his Portus " Suidas in θρύψις et χαρίτων habet θρύμμα recte, etsi neget Kusterus."
Kuster in his note to this passage also approves θρύμμα, and it has since been found in the Ravenna MS.
Nevertheless, for the reasons given in the Commentary, I, like all other editors, prefer θρέμμα.
Between Τρυφη̑ς and πρόσωπν Dindorf proposed to insert τε, and Velsen does insert σὺ987.

Bentley is thought to have suggested οἰδ’ οἰδ’, but no doubt his marginal note referred to 998 infra.-τηνδεδί R. H. F. Bekker, recentiores.

οἰδ’ οἰδ’ MSS. vulgo, but one οἰδ’ is omitted by Fracini, Gelenius, and all editions between Gelenius and Brunck.
It was therefore omitted in the edition which Bentley used:
and his restoration of οἰδ’ οἰδ’ no doubt re­ ferred to this line.
See on 989 supra. —ἐγώ σε MSS. vulgo.
ε̃γωγε Scholiast, Bothe, which seems a very probable reading.999.
ε̃λαχε MSS. vulgo. ε̃λαχεν Brunck “ ob metrum " and so Invernizzi.
But of course the metre does not require the change.1003.

ὠ τάλαν MSS. vulgo.

But I quite agree with Dr. Blaydes that in the mouth of a woman ὠ τάλαν is preferable to ὠ τα̑ν.1006.

I cannot understand on what ground Boeckh (Public Eco­ nomy, iv.

He gives no reason, and cannot, I think, have suffi­ ciently considered its real bearing.1020.

The same text is found in the two next editions, called Scaliger's and Le Fevre's, but as they translate it by impune, it is clear that the text of Portus is retained by a mere oversight.—λαβομένας MSS.

This read­ ing was doubtless found by Marco Musuro (the Aldine editor) in the MSS.

ε̄λκεις ἂνδρα ;
τὸν (with ἂγω) Bergk. ἒλκεις;
ες Meineke, Blaydes, Velsen.
But with εἰσάγω the preposition is super­ fluous;
and the girl's answer shows that the Hag had declared not merely whither, but for what purpose, she was haling the youth:
viz. to be her bus­ band.—εὶσάγω R. H. P1. vulgo.
εἰσάγων F. ἂγω Bergk.1040.
μήτηρ ἀν H. F. P1. vulgo.
The ἀν is omitted by R.—αὐτῳ̑ R. H. F. vulgo.

This is Le Fevre's sug­ gestion adopted by Brunck, and all sub­ sequent editors.
The MSS.
and all edi­ tions before Brunck read νόμον, which, as Le Fevre says, migrated here from 1041.1049.
τονδὶ, παραβα̑σα Bothe, Meineke, Blaydes, Yelsen.
παραβα̑σα τόνδε MSS. vulgo.
Brunck says "Trajectae voces sic ordinandae, ποῑ, παραβᾱσα τὸν νόμ

but this does not seem permissible.
The collocation τόνδε τὸν νόμον was probably derived from 1043.1063.

The Scholiast in his explanation (which is altogether erroneous) of the youth's meaning has the words πλέον ἢπερ βούλομαι, and Person suggested that this reading should be placed in the text, and it is so placed by Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk, Meineke, and Blaydes:
but Porson's suggestion was made before R.'s reading was known:
and he would not, I feel sure, have made it after­ wards.1065.

Bergk strangely reads ἢτις εἶ γραυ̑, a quite impossible reading, since the youth supposes that he is speaking to a girl, and has not yet discovered that he is in the clutches of another Hag.
With more probability Cobet suggests η̑τις εἶ σὐ, which is ndopted by Mcineke and Velsen.
But there is not the slightest necessity for any alteration of the text.

καλεῖς was suggested by Blaydes in the Preface to his first edition of the Birds (see on 1104 supra) and afterwards by Cobet, and is read by Meineke, Blaydes, and Velsen.

Per­ son in his Preface to the Hecuba objected to the dactyl in trochaics and proposed διὰ TO γελᾶν, which is read by Meineke, Holden, and Velsen.
But see the passage cited from Hephaestion in the Commentary on 893.1164.

παρὰ is the preposition by the side of ” that is to say "along with."
The line is rightly translated by Le Fevre " Laser­ pitium cum meUe interfuso.”
Dindorf, however, suggests πρασο, Meineke καραβο, and Blaydes, followed by Vel­ sen, writes τυρο.
The emendations πρασο and τυρο stand self-condemned, for the word must necessarily be trio syllabic.
If any change were required, I should suggest καρυο, but I feel no doubt that Aristophanea wrote παραο here, as ἐπὶ in the following line.

The sixth which is incomparably the best, he introduces into the text and is fol­ lowed by Velsen.
Dindorf thought that ταχὺ καὶ should be deleted, and I have placed the words in brackets.1176.

Mal, εύαὶ.
From these exclama­ tions to the end, the reading is that of R. and modern editors generally.
H. agrees with R. except that it divides εὺαὶ into two words εὺa?;
and repeats them five times (for R.'s four) in the final line, and has εὺαίως for εὺαὶ, ὼς in the preceding line, and so the editions before Invernizzi.
From Gelenius to Brunck inclusive, έπὶ ῃwas changed into έπινίκί.
Bothe changes εὺαὶ into εὺοὶ everywhere after δειπνήσομεν, and Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes, do the same in the first two words of the final line.
Bergk in 1179 changes εὺαὶ into ὶαὶ."
Not a mere drily correct version, but a spirited piece, which will give the English reader a very good idea of the celebrated ‘ Clouds,' and, what is of more importance, may be perused with pleasure.”—Spectator.“
A most successful performance.
Not only the meaning and metres of Aristo­ phanes are faithfully represented, but also his tone and spirit:
his sparkling wit, his pointed raillery, his broad farce, his poetical flights, and the manly vigour of his sober moods.
Even the puns, and other almost untranslatable forms of expression, are not lost to the English reader.
Excellent notes are appended to the Greek text."- Athenæum."
A good edition and translation of the ‘Clouds.’”—Dr. Donaldson (Classical Scholarship and Classical Learning)."
An able, pleasant, and valuable book.
It has a well-written Preface;
a care­ fully prepared text;
a readable, sometimes striking, translation;
and notes which are lively and full of literature.
We shall be glad to meet Mr. Rogers on this old classical field again.
”—Pall Mall Gazelle."
The version is so terse as to run almost line for line with the Greek, while it is lively enough to tempt the mere English reader, and accurate enough to give pleasure to the scholar who has the Greek before him.
The notes are marked with a pleasant freshness, and contain much interesting information, and not a little old Athenian gossip, culled from Athenæus and elsewhere.
The critical Appendix is most interesting.
The reader will find a remarkably graphic sketch of the feeling in Greece at this time in Mr. Rogers'
Preface.
We anticipate with much pleasure the promise given in the Preface to this play that we may shortly look for a version of the Thesmophoriazusae from the same pen.”—London Review."
The best metrical version which we ever remember to have seen of any of the Plays of Aristophanes.
We hope that so vigorous a translator and so genuine an admirer of Aristophanes will persevere in his undertaking.
General readers will not easily find another translator who does his work with so much spirit and such evident enjoyment.
”—Spectator.
"A scholarly translation, so lively yet so literal as to console for the loss which literature sustains by the unfinished condition of Frere's treatment of the same Play.”—Saturday Review."
In a former translation by Mr. Rogers (as we said at the time), not only the meaning and metres of Aristophanes are faithfully represented, but also his tone and spirit:
his sparkling wit, his pointed raillery, his broad farce, his poetical flights, and the manly vigour of his sober moods.
The work now before us seems to have all the merits which distinguished Mr. Rogers's former performance as a translation, while as a piece of critical editing it is decidedly superior to it.
If the Comedies of Aristophanes are to be naturalized in English, it would not be easy to find a translator more suited in every way for the task than Mr. Rogers has shown himself to be.
Compared with Frere or Mitchell, he has greatly the advantage in terseness and compactness, preserving far more of the form of the original;
and though of course such closeness cannot be attained without occasional loss of freedom and spirit, it is surprising to see how little is really sacrificed.”—Athenæum."
Mr. Rogers has translated the ' Peace in a manner bespeaking an ac­ complished scholar.
His aim is to be literal, but not at the expense of readableness, and the compromise is very cleverly carried into effect.
Freedom as regards metre and expression is recognized within due bounds and under the surveillance of a correct ear and an unpedantic taste.
The result is a very pleasing version.
It entitles him to a rank not far below Walsh and Frere among first-class translators of Aristophanes.”
—Contemporary Review."
We have in this Play, as in the ' Clouds' and ' Peace,' the great advantage of the companionship of Mr. Rogers, whose volumes must be welcomed alike by the scholar, the antiquary, and the English reader.
His translation is a wonderful success, and catches the Aristophanic tone exactly;
in fact we think that neither Mitchell, Walsh, nor Frere comes near him, taking accuracy and spirit both into account.”— Quarterly Review."
We recommend this volume to the reader as the most valuable and pleasant edition of a Greek play that we have ever met.”—British Quarterly."
It would be impossible to excel this admirable line-for-line translation.
Mr. Rogers stands on equal grounds with Frere.”—New Quarterly."
Consists of text, notes, and translations:
the text carefully revised in the light of that classical erudition which Mr. Rogers is known to possess, the translation done in a masterly style that may fairly be pronounced in the manner of Frere, and the notes full of learning and valuable illustration.
No commendation could be too high for most of those portions of the translation done into long rhymed metres.”—London Quarterly.
"All students of Aristophanes will feel grateful to Mr. Rogers.
It is hardly too much to say that he has given a new value and interest to the play.”—Saturday Review."
As for the manner in which Mr. Rogers has done his work, it is difficult to use praise sufficiently high.
His notes are full of excellent scholarship and leave nothing to be desired in the way of explanation.
As for his translation, it is simply a marvel of ease and skill.
It would not be too much to say that no English translation of a classical author surpasses the rhymed portions.”—Spectator.“
A delightful rendering of a famous play.”—Educational Times.
Decidedly the most complete edition as yet published in England.
We earnestly hope that Mr. Rogers will not rest till he has given us the less known plays with equal completeness.”—Academy."
Mr. Rogers has a marvellous facility in metre and rhyme.
In the translation, where all is excellent, it is difficult to select.”—Athenæum."
Quite equal to Frere, and somewhat closer to the original.”—Pictorial Times.“
Mr. Rogers's success as a translator is so marked, we had almost said so brilliant, that we cannot but regret that he did not choose a play which would have afforded freer scope to his powers.
Indeed, in his fertility of rhythmic resource, he may almost be said to rival the inexhaustible wealth of his original.
”—Pall Mall Gazette.“
A very careful, scholarly, and useful book.”—Journal of Education.“
Excellently translated and edited.”—Evening Standard.
Acceptable alike to the scholar and the general reader.”—Press and St. James's Chronicle."
A clear and accurate text, a capital commentary, and, above all, undoubtedly the best verse translation of the play which has yet been published.
By way of adding our quota to the chorus of praise which Mr. Rogers's ' Wasps is eliciting, we need only say that it is his bappiest effort.”—Examiner."
It is not often that either scholar or critic or student of poetry has before him a more satisfying book than this version of the 'Lysistrata.'
As to the execution of the Play in detail, and irrespective of the tact and delicacy shown throughout, it is certainly not less than masterly;
and there is an inimitable litheness and impetuosity of movement in the more difficult and intricate portions of the dialogue.
It is a work which can scarcely be too highly commended.”—London Quarterly."
Every page shows the translator's scholarship, and every difficult passage gives proof-of his delicacy and good taste.”
—Saturday Review."
Mr. Rogers is to be congratulated on a translation which, for spirit and ingenuity of rendering, and for grace and facility of versification, is worthy to take rank beside his excellent edition of the ‘Wasps.’
To the work, as a whole, we can hardly give higher praise than to say that it fully sustains Mr. Rogers's reputation as a translator.
”—Pall .all Gazette."
A version which preserves to us all the spirit and splendour of the original, without its coarse jokes and allusions.
From this single translation the English reader will form the best possible impression of the sparkling wit, the pointed raillery, the unfailing humour, and the strong common sense of the poet's more sober moods.
The spirit of Aristophanes seems to breathe from every line;
yet so easy and unrestrained is its tone that it reads everywhere like an original.”— Press and St. James's Chronicle."
The translation is a marvel of easy elegance, and of fidelity to the spirit, grace, and rhythmical melody of the original, which loses none of its charms by the pure English idiom which is here the main feature of the translator's work.
It will be equally acceptable to the scholar and the general reader who will gain from its pages a better and more faithful impression of the tone and spirit, the fun and frolic, and the manly vigour and political insight of Aristophanes than from any other work on him.”—Public Opinion.
"The translation conveys to English readers in an unusual degree the true meaning and flavour of the original.
The few notes which appear in the present volume show a remarkably sound and independent opinion.
‘—Academy."
Mr. Rogers won his spurs in the field of Aristophanic scholarship many years ago by an admirably executed edition and translation of the ' Clouds';
that he followed up with a still better one of the ' Peace';
and that by a better again of the ' Wasps.'
The present version is full of the highest intelligence and scholar­ ship, and what is still more important in a poetic translation, of fine metrical instinct.
We have seldom had to notice a more thoroughly satisfactory rendering of a classic work into English verse.”—Notes and Queries.
