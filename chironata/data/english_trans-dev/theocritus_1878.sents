FOR the biography of the foremost of Bucolic minstrels, the pastoral poet Theocritus, unfortunately few materials exist.
Indeed the little which is known is inferred either from the actual poems of Theocritus himself, or from such as have been published under his name.
Of the latter class is the 22nd epigram, from which we gather his parentage and birth-place, and which is generally held to have been the work of Ar­ temidorus the grammarian.
Evidently written with a view to distinguishing between our poet and his Chian namesake, an orator and sophist, it fixes for his native place Syracuse, and for his parents Praxagoras and Philinna.
With this account Suidas substantially agrees, though he adds that some make Theocritus the son of Simichus, or Simichidas, and holds that, being originally a native of Cos, he had become a metæch or foreign settler at Syracuse.
Now if we compare this notion with the Scholia on the 7th Idyll, vs. 21, (where it is suggested by some that the name is an assumed one, derived from σίμος, flat-nosed,) as well as with the Θεοκϱίτου γένος, it seems that a confusion has arisen with regard to the identity of Theocritus with Simichidas, into whose mouth the 7th Idyll is put.
It does not seem to have occurred to those who make Simi­ chus the father of the Syracusan poet, that bards are wont to shadow forth their own words, thoughts, and acts, under ficti­ tious names and unreal characters, and that Theocritus might really have described what happened to himself in the "Thaly­ sia," and yet not have used the name of Simichidas, otherwise than Virgil uses that of Tityrus.
—Nor is there any reason to suppose that the claims of Cos to the honour of his birth and early training rest on stronger grounds than that he studied under Philetus of Cos, whom he mentions in Idyll vii.
40, whe­ ther at Cos itself or in Alexandria is not clear.
Of Philetus,. and Asclepiades, of whom he speaks as τὸν ἐσθλὸν Σικελίδαν το̃ν ἐκ Σάμω, (Idyll vii. 40,) it is known that they were dis­ tinguished poets of the Alexandrian school, whom Theocritus professedly admired, and of the former of whom he was pro­ bably a pupil.
There is internal evidence in the Idylls of the poet, that I resided for some space at Alexandria, and afterwards at Syracuse, whilst the 7th Idyll shows such a knowledge of the localities of Cos, as could hardly, one should think, have been obtained without a personal acquaintance with the island.
Here may have arisen his intimacy with Ni­ cias of Miletus, the physician to whom he dedicated the 11th and 13th Idylls, and to whose wife, Theugenis, he wrote a pleasing ditty, (28th,) with a silver distaff.
-But this is mere conjecture, arising probably out of the nearness of Cos to Miletus.
To Alexandria Theocritus was no doubt at­ tracted by the fame of its library, founded by Ptolemy Soter, and raised to its highest point of eminence by his son Philadelphus, under whose care it became the resort of tht, most distinguished literati of the day, Zenodotus, Callimachus, Hegesias, Euclid, Aratus.
To the last of these, the astro­ nomer and poet, who was the author of the Phænomena, he addressed his 6th Idyll, and his name occurs again in the Idyll following.
Association with such a man would not be without its advantages, and we here and there discover traces of his having imbibed from his friend some acquaintance with astronomical matters.
But it was probably at Alex­ andria, too, that he found access to the pages of the Septua­ gint, itself a lasting monument of the Egyptian monarch's zeal in the collection of literary treasures.
No one can read the 16th, 18th, 20th, and 23rd Idylls without being struck by the similarity of thought and expression of passages in each, to portions of the Psalms of David, the Book of Job, the Song of Solomon, and the Prophecies of Isaiah.
The parallels have been pointed out in the notes to the present translation:
but the strength of internal evidence to the supposition that Theo­ critus availed himself of the access, which he might undoubt­ edly have had, to the Septuagint, receives additional force in the comparison of the whole scene of altercation between Pollux and Amycus with the historical record of the encounter be­ tween David and Goliath in the First Book of Samuel.
It can hardly be doubted that Theocritus composed the 14th, 15th, and 17th Idylls at Alexandria :
he could not have enjoyed even the passing favour and brief notice of Ptolemy Phila­ delphus, without becoming interested in the law and records of that strange race, the Jews of many wanderings ;
one hun­ dred and twenty thousand of whom had been liberated by that monarch from the slavery in which Ptolemy Soter had bound them.
Josephus (Antiq. xii.
2) writes at length respecting the interest shown by Ptolemy Philadelphus in obtaining for his vast library an accurate translation of the Books of the Old Testament.
We find from him how the monarch strove to purchase the good will of the nation by sending splendid gifts to the God of Israel:
how he valued the translators and their translations :
and how he conversed with his librarian, Demetrius Phalereus, on the deep meaning and superior wisdom of the Jewish law.
And we know enough of the tide of fashion, especially if it is royal taste that lifts the floodgate, which carries onward successful literature of any class, to feel sure that a scholar could hardly have tarried even for a brief space at Alexandria without inspect­ ing that volume, which even to heathens was a work of wonder, fostered by reflecting credit upon one of the fore­ most of the then rulers of the world.
A poet likewise, im­ bued, as was Theocritus, with a sense of the charm of natural simplicity, and having withal, as some of his poems show, no mean appreciation of the glorious epic, could never have been content with a transient glance at a collection of Such infinite graces, simplicity, grandeur, natural colouring, and noble imagery, as the translation of the Seventy elders, inferior though it be in diction to the original.
No!
like others, he dipped often into that well of wisdom, albeit he knew not the spell which renders it sweeter to the taste than all other waters.
Hovering around those sacred pages, he caught the scent of flowers of poesy, which he has transferred into his Idylls, and we have the gratification of an involuntary testi­ nony from a heathen poet to the charms of composition and material, with which the sacred volume is so richly fraught.
Our taste will be wilfully dull, if it acknowledge not the extreme probability that the Syracusan saw the Septuagint, and there need be no stumbling-block in the argument that he no where mentions the Jews.
He dived for pearls of poesy, leaving unexplored the buried treasures of history and reli­ gion.
Without satisfactory data for any certain conclusion, we can at least give the benefit of probabilities in favour of our poet's acquaintance with the Septuagint.
From this we pass on to other matter.
Theocritus, while at Alexandria, was allowed, we presume, to dedicate his 17th Idyll to Ptolemy Philadelphus ;
and we have reason to suppose that the 14th and 15th were com­ posed there also.
But it is clear that he did not find the monarch and his capital such kindly fosterers of his Muse as he might have expected:
for very soon we find him hymning at Syracuse the praises (considerably qualified by doubts of his open-handedness) of King Hiero the Second.
That monarch had ascended the throne B. C. 270 :
and the Idyll to which reference has been made, appears to have been written during the 1st Punic War, if we may judge from the allusion which he makes to the failing Carthagi­ nians, and Hiero's alliance with their implacable foe.
This would fix the date of the Idyll as 263 B. c.;
when a treaty between Hiero and the Romans was concluded.
But the rays of courtly favour must have .
been here also any thing but warm, the atmosphere chilly, when a poet was to be cher­ ished, or creative genius to be saved from starvation and blight.
Hiero's munificence was bestowed rather on kingdoms and potentates, than on minstrels and their songs.
Perhaps
Theo­ critus discovered at this point the mistake of trusting in princes for the advancement of poetic excellence:
at any rate, the greater portion of his Idylls show him to have sought in the calm tranquillity of country life and pastoral scenery, that independent self-reliance, Which, after all, is the safest nurse of the lovely rhyme.
Though when he rises to heroics, as in the encomiums on Ptolemy and Hiero, and in the 22nd, 24th, and 25th Idylls, he fully sustains his reputation, and no where falls into poverty of language, or mediocrity of conception;
yet it is on the first eleven Idylls, the 14th, 15th, and 21st, that his title to the fame, which has been universally ac­ corded to him, is most really and justly based.
Bion and Moschu3 are pretty conceit-weavers :
they sometimes delight US'with passages unrivalled for warmth of colouring and ten­ derness of pathos :
-but for simple rural life, accurately and tastefully depicted, for the thorough appreciation of nature, and reliance thereupon for the staple of his song, Theocritus ranks immeasurably above them.
He stands alone, with a crowd of imitators at a wide interval of merit.
Virgil's Ec­ logues have no inherent stamp of reality about them.
We lack the shepherd's account of his own life among his sheep.
There is more of polish than of nature.
We have the cour­ tier drawing smooth pictures from fancy ;
not the passion­ ate lover of the country deriving his materials from the real landscapes on which he is actually looking out.
To borrow an apt expression, Virgil's Eclogues are pictures of a polished mind playing at shepherd.
And as to our own pastoral writers, Spenser, Pope, Gay, Lyttleton, and Shenstone, none reach to half the height of Bucolic minstrelsy, to which their great model undeniably attained.
Spenser's dialect and metre are unfavourable to his subject;
and hecan lay no claim to be a true bard of nature ;
while it is matter of fact that beneath his rural images there is an under-current of allusion to matters of religion.
Who can enjoy with true zest the pastoral, where the shepherd Roffin symbolizes a bishop of Rochester, and the watch-dog Lowder, one of his chaplains ?
(See Shepherd's Calendar, Eel. ix.)
And as for Pope, whose pretensions rank next, his pastorals deserve credit only because they were written by a boy of sixteen ;
it were an insult to compare them with the mature productions of Theocritus.
For smoothness of versification, they have indeed won praise from Macaulay and the Earl of Carlisle;
but these two most capable judges assign to them no higher meed.
Indeed, had Pope's pastorals alone survived their author, we may well question whether his name would have even been remembered.
As for the rest, they claim still less right to tread the same ground, to rank in the same order with Theocritus, in that portion of the temple of fame which good taste will always assign to the Pastoral or Bu­ colic poets.
Coarse though the Syracusan bard be here and there, he is indeed, as Quinctilian calls him, " admirabilis in suo genere," nor is it any detraction from his well-won laurels that the same critic goes on to say, " sed musa illa rustica et pastoralis non forum mode, verum ipsam etiam urbem reformidat."
(Inst. Orator, x. 1.)
It must be borne in mind, when we stumble on grave objections against the poems of Theocritus, that his idea of simplicity is not a transcendental, but a natural one.
He has no model Arcadia in view :
his eye is all the while upon the woods and vales and river pastures of his native Sicily ;
taking his shepherds as he found them there, mak­ in,, them speak what they did speak, not what they ought to have spoken.
There are blemishes to his Idylls, which cer­ tainly render an expurgated edition of them a desideratum :
but these affect more or less all the chief writers of antiquity.
The question however which is just now dividing the educa­ tional world of France, seems to us to admit of but one solu­ tion.
What is true of most of the Greek and Latin Classics, is of course true of Theocritus, as one of them.
We cannot) forego the charms of the whole, because our delicacy is of­ fended, our purity shocked, by one or two Idylls, which, while they illustrate the darkest traits in the life of a heathen, only make us the more thankful that Christianity has at least gone far to banish one of the worst forms of human guilt and degradation.)
But upon the whole, the poems of Theocritus, without aiming at any deep moral lesson, are eminently calcu­ lated to nourish in us a growth of that keen taste for rural scenery, which is one of the purest and finest of earthly yearn­ ings :
whilst in liveliness, variety, and rhythm they certainly surpass anything of their kind, ancient or modern.
And this must have arisen from the familiarity in which, we infer, The­ ocritus passed his latter years with rural scenes and characters.
It is seldom that we have no notice, at any rate no tradition, respecting the death of the poets of the ancient world.
Of Hesiod, Simonides, Æschylus, Sophocles, Callimachus, Apol­ lonius, Rhodius, (and these are but a few names taken hap-ha­ zard,) we find some story at least, vague though it be, of their death or their burial-place.
But Theocritus seems to have vanished from before the eyes of men, after he had lamented at Syracuse the small account in which bards of his day were held of tyrants.
May he not have ended his days unnoticed in some quiet spot, to rise long after into fame by his depic­ tion of it, while his bones lay sepulchred on one of the head­ lands which he puts before us so vividly ?
Did he not fall.
asleep afar from the din of cities, bewept, like his fabled Daphnis, by universal nature ?
Ovid, we can hardly doubt, was in his Ibis confusing the poet with his Chian namesake, where he says, Utque Syracosio præstrietâ.
fauce poetæ Sic animæ laqueo sit via clausa tibi.
Lib. in Ibim, 554.
In a note upon this passage in the Delphin edition, it is ob­ served, that the old interpreters understood this to mean that Theocritus was hung by the son of Hiero, king of Sicily, on account of his invectives against him.
But this only proves the fear of him, who wrote the epigram before alluded to, as distinguishing the name-sakes of Syracuse and Chios, to have been a well-grounded fear.
Ovid, if, by the Syracusan poet, he means Theocritus, seems to have stumbled on the rock of which that epigram might have warned him.
The fate of the Chian seems to have been transferred in his mind to the Syracusan, as will be seen by the following extract from Macrobius, Saturnalia, lib. vii. c. 3."King Antigonus put to death the Chian Theocritus, al­ though he was bound by an oath to spare him, on account of an unfortunate joke of that individual at his expense.
For when he was being dragged before Antigonus as if to receive punishment, and his friends were comforting him, and afford­ ing hopes that he would experience the royal clemency, when once he had come before the eyes of the king ;
Then,' observed he, ‘ the hope you hold out of safety is a vain one.'
For the king had lost one eye.
So the ill-timed witticism cost the prisoner his life.
"Now if we thus clear away this very apparent confusion between the two, we have no account of the death of the pastoral poet;
no, nor the vaguest allusion to it.
But the works which survive him are evidence that he has not all died:
while taste survives, he must hold undisputed supremacy in his own branch of the poetic art.
Of the origin and nature of that species of poetry which dates its ascendency from Theocritus, there is little which has not been said again and again.
The student who desires to arrive at the results of older lucubrations on this subject, must wade through subtle distinctions and learned disquisitions respecting pastoral and heroic poetry.
He will find that the birth-place of the former is contended by some to have been Sicily, by others Arcadia.
And while one and another ascribe its first authorship to various poets of more or less historical periods, some have been fain to date it from the golden age.
Now, when we gain experience of the diffi­ culties which arise in reconciling so many and diverse state­ ments, and find that the more effort we make, the further we drift into a sea of troubles, our natural inclination coincides with some sort of likelihood, which is in favour of that last opinion.
The truth may be that some kind of pastoral was the first form of poetry.
What more natural, when we reflect that the eldest of the human race reckoned their superiority by their flocks and herds.
Men were all shepherds:
and so little of shame was there connected with an occupation now so lowly, that no higher or more expressive title for a mighty ruler was sought than that of " shepherd of his peoples."
Of course, under these circumstances, the pastoral was likely to be an early form of poetry, and withal one not likely to be despised.
Indeed, among those who practised it at an early date were Moses and Miriam, Deborah and Barak, as well as the sweet Psalmist of Israel.
When therefore we discuss the age of its invention, we can but say that it was of every age.
The first up-rising of it was, we may conclude, in that primæval condition of men, when the system of concentration into towns and fenced cities had not yet begun:
but when men led a nomad life, and whiled their hours afield by alternate strains, whilst they were pastur­ ing their flocks.
It was the song of nature, little polished per­ haps, but still not without its inspiration, because it flowed directly from the shrines of her, whom he that worships most is ever the truest and most accepted poet.
The rustling of the trees, the vocal pine, the murmurings of rivulets, the very notes of birds, were so many of nature's hints to man to create for himself a harmony more excellent in proportion as the gift of speech excels all inarticulate sounds.
And when we add to this the influence of a sunny sky, a genial atmosphere, a mind unruffled with the cares and sins which harass and pollute the life of crowded cities, the wonder would be if song had not arisen ;
and that song, in common gratitude, of such a kind as should depict and hold up to imitation the life which was so singularly blessed.
Gratitude, too, led them no doubt to celebrate the festivals of their gods, the tutelar deities of light and shade, of cattle and of fruits- Apollo, Diana, Pan, and Ceres.
Prizes offered for such strains at these holy seasons would kindle a rivalry promotive of advancement, and render easier the steps by which they should pass into an art.
This is probably the key to the mythical ascription of pastoral poetry to Apollo Nomius, the herds­ man whilome in the halls of Admetus.
Diomus, Daphnis, and Stesiehorus, all of them Sicilian, may have been its first promoters upon Dorian soil;
and as Theocritus seems to have been the first who applied a highly cultivated mind to the task of infusing into Amæbœan strains the grace and beauty which he has wrought into his Idylls, his country Sicily stands justly foremost as the birth-place of Bucolic minstrelsy.
The Dorian character, too, was apter than that of other races to this kind of poetry:
mimetic art had its eminent representative in the Sicilian Sophron:
and among them mimetic and comic dia­ logue, as well as pastoral, arose in some measure out of the unstudied repartees of the Lydiastæ and Bucolistæ, or of some such performers.
These gave a basis, whereon the more studied Idyll might take its stand, and the great master of whom we are treating, was not slow to apply all his varied knowledge of nature and of art to this lively form of poetry, so calculated to keep the interest from flagging, the hearer or reader from becoming wearied.
He first moulded these rude strains into grace and beauty.
He smoothed the ruggednesses of verse.
He inspired the picture with novel life ;
and, whilst he preserved the guise of nature throughout, evinced that master power which is most teeming with the perfection of art, when its creations look likest nature.
It remains that we should attempt a classification of the various poems of Theocritus which have come down to us.
The arguments to each of these have been prefixed in the body of the translation.
Of the thirty Idylls extant, ten are properly Bucolics, the 1st, the 3rd, and all up to the 12th.
The 2nd Idyll can scarcely come under this head, though the wider term εἴδη, or εἰδύλλια, pictures, that is, of common every­ day life, may embrace that as well as the 14th, 15th, the 21st, and perhaps some others.
Some, however, claim the 2nd and 15th for a separate class under the head of mimetic Idylls.
The 12th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 23rd, 27th, and 29th, are erotic :
the 16th and 17th, encomiastic:
the 22nd, 24th, 25th, and 26th, belong to the epic class ;
whilst the 28th is epistolary, and the 30th Anacreontic.
Of those classed as erotic, the manner and form isvarious, as the reader will ob­ serve.
The genuineness of all the Idylls after the 18th has been much questioned :
this however is not a matter either likely to repay great research, or calculated to interest the general reader.
They are for the most part in hexameter verse :
the thirty-two epigrams are some of them elegiac, some epodic.
It is difficult to fix upon one beauty beyond another in these matchless pastorals, by singling out which one may send the uninitiated reader with a whetted appetite to the whole volume.
A thousand charms of poesy press forward, each claiming foremost commemoration.
In the first Idyll we linger long over the sorrows of Daphnis, which Virgil has transfused into his Eclogues, over the immortal lines (66— 69) which have lost none of their pristine sweetness, when, having passed the ordeal of transplantation, they bloom anew in the Lycidas of Milton, (Lycidas, 1. 50,) "
Where were ye, nymphs, when the remorseless deep," &c.;
or yet again in the same Idyll, over that (to the translator's taste at least) most enviable epitaph, (140, 141,) In the second Idyll, we view the fierceness of disappointed love, in the raging passion of Simætha :
in the sixth, a more rustic and clownish, yet not less touching, hopelessness, at­ tributed to the Cyclops in the song of Damætas.
Or if pretty picturings of scenery are more the object of our search, what translation can-do justice to the 13th Idyll, the Hylas, the charming rural scene in the end of the 7th, or the 25th Idyll from the 34th to the 50th line ?
There are passages in the Hylas unsurpassed by any poet of whatever age or clime ;
as, for instance, from the 35th to the 60th line, where the capture of the youth by the enamoured Naiads is depicted.
The Gossips of Theocritus are such a life-like picture, so capitally drawn, that it were a work of supererogation to point it out, or to commend it.
It is nature itself, not as it was seen in Sicily, or in Alexandria, but as it ever has been throughout the world.
The Epithalamium of Helen (18th) and the Infant Hercules (24th) are excellent in their kinds ;
and the Honey-stealer (19th) won the notice and translating hand of the poet Moore, by its Anacreontic savour.
And by no means must any reader pass by the fishermen of the 21st Idyll.
Their wattled cabin is an old favourite of every lover of Theocritus :
and there is untold humour in Asphalion's dream, and his sage comrade's advice thereupon.
But it is invidious to mention these.
The beauties uncom­ memorated may with ease be proved to eclipse the few which we have instanced.
The touch of Theocritus left no subject without some impress of native grace and liveliness.
" Nihil, quod tetigit, non ornavit.
"Of the Epigrams, the 6th, “ on the loss of the kid," the 14th, an epitaph on Eurymedon, and the 15th, another on the same, are very beautiful.
The Epigram on the Bank of Caicus, (23rd,) might fitly stand translated over the doors of the safest estab­ lishments- of a like nature in modern days ;
whilst, on the principle of keeping the best till last, we are bound to set before all, as praise the noblest in the aim, the most glorious in the acquisition, the conclusion of the Epigram on the Sici­ lian Epicharmus (Epigr. xvii.) :
Full many a rule of life he drew, Still pointing to the fair, the true, The youthful mind:
High favour crowns the bard.
(Polwhele.)IF materials are scanty for a Life of Theocritus, they are much more so for those of his first imitators, Bion and Moschus.
An Elegy of the latter is the only faint glimmer of light, by which we can guess at, we cannot say discern, aught of history of the former.
Yet it would interest us if we could know how far Bion professedly reverenced Theocritus, what value he set upon simplicity in Pastorals, whether he aimed at a new school of that branch of the poetic art, and whether he would account as an improvement that over-refined sentiment­ ality which robs his Muse of all claim to be a child of nature.
But, except the 3rd Idyll of Moschus, no data for his life exist-unless we take upon the authority of Suidas that he was born beside that river, which by tradition is reputed to have reared on its banks the greatest of poets, the immortal Homer, the river Meles, at Phlossa in the neighbourhood of Smyrna.
From the Elegy above referred to, we assume that Bion left his native country for Sicily, and spent at least his latter days in cultivating the Bucolic minstrelsy, so thoroughly identified with that pastoral isle.
It seems hardly safe how­ ever to lay it down, with some, on the faith of the words in Moschus, (Id. iii. 17, &c.,) that Bion visited Thrace and Macedonia;
because the sense of the passage does not neces­ sarily imply more than that Strymonian swans and Æagrian nymphs might well mourn and weep afresh, since a Dorian, equal to their native Orpheus, had ceased to breathe forth his lovely lays.
One fact, however, stands out distinctly, namely, that the poet came to an untimely death by poison, which was administered to him by more than one individual, and that the murderers, whosoever they were, paid the penalty of their crime.
The age of Bion can be determined only by the statement of Moschus, (iii. 100—105,) that he was one of his disciples, and that Theocritus mourned his loss.
Grant - ing this, we must take his date as 280 B. C.
As has been before observed in the Life of Theocritus, the poems of Bion which have come down to us are vastly inferior in pastoral beauty, in natural simplicity, and inherent truthful­ ness, to the works of the Syracusan master.
But here and there we chance upon a passage of eminent loveliness.
Every where the Asiatic softness seems to add luxurious grace to his tuneful songs ;
though this is but a poor substitute for the vigorous and healthy freshness of the Father of Pastorals.
Bion standing alone would soon fade from our memories.
He is fortunate in being preserved with his pupil and elegiast to complete the volume of Greek Pastoral Poets, which is, alas !
our sole legacy in this kind from the Alexandrian school.
His versification is very elegant;
his language, Doric, with some few Ionicisms and Atticisms.
THE poet Moschus seems to have found no kindred spirit to embalm his memory in harmonious numbers :
or if he had that fortune, it has not survived the oblivion which so remorselessly overwhelms the rest of his personal history.
We reckon him a Syracusan, whose day was about the close of the third century before Christ.
And he must have been con­ temporaneous with Bion, probably in age somewhat younger.
He does not reach the excellence of his friend and teacher, far less that of Theocritus.
Indeed there lies over all his pieces a clothing of affectation, and study of ornament, which makes them read as forced and unnatural compositions.
Still many passages might be quoted which are highly poetic, none more so perhaps than that exquisite passage in the third Idyll, (105—114,) where, in a lament over the briefness of this mor­ tal life, the mighty of the earth are contrasted with the flowers of the field in such an earnest tone of pathos, as shows the enlightened heathen dissatisfied with prevailing religions, whilst it teaches our own higher privileges, to us -who have, held out and within our grasp, " the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life.
"THE elegiac poet, Tyrtæus, whose remains, in an English garb, close the present volume, follows immediately in his branch of the poetic art, the founder -of Greek elegy, Callinus.
An elegy, according to the Greek notion, is a poem composed of a combination of hexameters and pentameters.
It seems often to have been of the nature of a dirge or lament, and the word ἔλεγος has no distinct reference to metrical form, though ἐλεγεία has.
Its origin was undoubtedly Asiatic.
Crossing the Ægean, it found one of its most eminent cultivators in Tyr­ tæus, the poet whom tradition has handed down to us as the Athenian present to their hereditary enemies the Spartans, when they had been directed by the Delphic oracle to seek a leader from Athens for the second Messenian war.
The story runs, that Athens, never hearty towards Sparta, save in her hatred, sent her the worst selection that, according to ap­ pearances, could be made,-a lame schoolmaster and composer of verses, who dwelt at Aphidnæ, a village of Attica :
and that this Ionian inspired the Dorian warriors who adopted him, with such spirit through his fiery strains, that victory crowned their prowess.
The second Messenian war is placed by Pausanias between 01. 23, 4 and 28, 1, that is, between B. c. 685 and 668:
but this date is considered by the latest authorities too high, and indeed, as Callinus probably flour­ ished about B. c. 660, and we are led to believe that Tyrtæus was but a few years junior to him, this would seem to be the more probable date.
The main features of the popular tradition, however pleas­ ing to our school-day notions of history, must of course be taken only as containing the germ of certain truths, and not as being themselves broad historical truths.
Castor and Pol­ lux, according to old legends, had been adopted by Aphidnus, the hero from whom Aphidnæ was named :
and as the Dios­ curi were Spartan, the Aphidnæans may have been moved by some feelings or ties of kindred, and not by the will of Athens, to send Tyrtæus to the aid of Laconia.
This would crush the fable of intentional insult on the part of Athens.
And then as to the origin of Tyrtæus, it cannot be doubted that he was of Ionian stock, (whether a native of Attica, or a settler in it from one of her Asiatic colonies, as Suidas states, it matters not, for the inventions of the colonies would soop find their way to their polished metropolis:
) because we know that the branch of poetry in which he excelled was pe­ culiarly Ionian;
and not such as can claim any early vigour or native success among the Dorians.
Whether he came from Miletus to Aphidnæ, or was born at the latter place, we need not inquire ;
there is no ground at any rate for the supposi­ tion that he was a Lacedæmonian by birth, as Strabo and Athenæus have stated on the authority of Philochorus and Callisthenes.
Surely his elegiac strains disprove this.
With regard to his lameness, and his supposed office of village school­ master at Aphidnæ, the truth to be evolved from these state­ ments is probably that he wrote uneven couplets, and, like other early poets, taught the art, of which he was so skilful a master.
If he was either by birth or by sojourn an Aphid­ naean, there is no wonder in his interest for Sparta, nor, on the other hand, any difficulty in understanding why, coining from Attica, he yet became a favourite with the Lacedæmonians.
'
And, certain it is, that whatever may have been his bodily defects, whatever his inexperience in generalship, his martial strains and wise counsels achieved much, in which a skilful general might have failed without them.
As a bard, he was no mean leader of his adopted countrymen :
for ages afterwards, their evening meal on their campaigns closed with the recitation of his spirit-stirring war-songs :
and when the foe was vanquish-The Poet, proposing to celebrate the end of Daphnis, the hero of Sicilian shepherds, finds an opening of his subject in a dialogue be­ tween a goatherd and a shepherd named Thyrsis.
The latter begs the former to sing with the accompaniment of his pipe.
This he de­ clines, for fear of awakening Pan, and strives to prevail upon Thyrsis, by the offer of a goat and a most highly wrought drinking-cup, to sing of the death of Daphnis.
Thyrsis accordingly begins by invok­ ing the Nymphs :
describes the grief of the brute creation at the sorrows of Daphnis:
the sympathy of Pan and Mercury, as well as the shepherds their -worshippers:
the bitterness of Daphnis towards Venus, who had caused his sorrows, but is now inclined to relent.
The song concludes with the farewell of Daphnis to all the objects of his former joys.
After which performance, the goatherd presents Thyrsis with the meed of his song.
Thyrsis.
1 OF a sweet nature, goatherd, is the murmur­ ing of yon pine, which tunefully rustles by the fountains:
and sweetly too do you play on the pipe :
next toPanyou shall carry off the second prize.
If he shall have taken the j horned he-goat, you shall receive the she-goat:
and if he shall have received as a gift of honour the she-goat, 2the yearling falls to your share:
and the flesh of the yearling-kid is good, until you shall have milked it.
Goatherd.
3 Sweeter, good shepherd, is thy melody, than yon resounding water pours down from the rock above.
If the Muses bear-off for themselves the sheep as a gift, you shall receive as your prize the 4young lamb:
but should it please them to receive the lamb, then you shall afterwards bear away the sheep.
Thyrs.
Are you willing, I ask you by the Nymphs, are you willing, goatherd, to take your seat here at this sloping mound, 5 where the tamarisks are, and to play upon your pipe ?
And I meanwhile will tend your she-goats.
Goath.
It is not right, good Shepherd, it is not right for us to pipe at mid-day:
6we are afraid of Pan ;
for in truth it is then he reposes wearied from the chase:
and he is crabbed, and sharp anger ever rests upon his nostril.
But (since you in fact, Thyrsis, have seen the sorrows of Daphnis, and have arrived at the summit of Bucolic minstrelsy) come, let us sit under the elm, opposite to the statue of Priapus, and the fountain-nymphs, even where that pastoral seat is, and the oaks.
And if you shall have sung, as of old you sang, when contending against Chromis from Libya, I will give you both a she-goat, 7 that suckles twins, to milk thrice a day, which though it has two kids will give milk to fill two pails, and a deep drinking-cup of ivy wood, rubbed with sweet wax, with two handles, fresh made, still smacking of the graving tool:
around whose lips ivy twines on 8 high, ivy interspersed with marigold ;
and the helix winds round about it rejoicing in the yellow fruit.
But on the inner sur­ face, a woman, a cunning kind of work of divine art, has been wrought, decked out in a flowing robe, and 9 a coif of-net-work, and, beside her, men with-beautifully-long-hair are contending with words, alternately, one from one side, another from another:
yet the words are not reaching her heart:
but one while she is glancing with a smile towards that man, and at another time she is again casting her thoughts on this:
whilst they by reason of love straining their eyes for a long time, are labouring to no purpose.
And 10 besides these, an old fisherman and a rugged rocf have been wrought, over which the old man is busily drag­ ging a huge net for a cast, 11like a man toiling with all his might.
You would say that he was fishing with the whole strength of his limbs, to such a degree are the sinews swelling every where about his neck, even though he is grey-headed;
Yet his powers are worthy of youth.
12 And at a little dis­ tance from the sea-worn old man, a vineyard is beautifully laden with ripe clusters:
which a little boy is watching, as he sits at the hedge-rows :
and around him two foxes, 13one is roaming up and down the rows, spoiling the ripe grapes, while the other, preparing all his subtlety for the boy's wallet, is vowing he will not leave the lad, before that 14he shall have brought him to beggary, as being without his breakfast.-j
But he in sooth is weaving a fine locust-trap with asphodel stalks, fitting them on rushes:
and neither is he at all con­ cerned for his wallet, nor for the fruits, so much as he is delighting about his platting.
But all about the cup clusters the moist 15 bear's-foot, a kind of Æolian sight:
the marvel would astonish your senses.
As the price of it, I gave to the Calydonian boatman, a goat and a large cheese cake of white milk, nor has it at all anywise reached 16 my lip, but it still lies untouched.
With this I would right willingly gratify you, if you would sing me, friend, that lovely hymn.
And I do not envy you at all.
Come, good sir!
for by no means shall 17 you ever hoard your song, at any rate for Hades that bringeth forgetfulness.
Thyrs. 18 Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
Here am I, Thyrsis from Ætna, and this is the voice of Thyrsis.
19 Wherever, I wonder, wherever were ye, Nymphs, when Daphnis pined away ?
were ye along the fair vales of the 20 Peneus, or along those of Pindus ?
for ye were not occupying, I ween, the broad stream of Anapus at any rate, nor the height of Ætna, nor the sacred wave of Acts.
Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
Him indeed the panthers, him the wolves bewailed.
For him, when dead, even the lion from the thicket wept aloud.
Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
At his feet many cows, ay and many bulls, and again many young heifers and steers lamented.
Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
Foremost came Hermes from the mountain, and said, 'Daph­ is, who wastes thee away ? of whom, my good friend, art ou so enamoured ?'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.21
The herdsmen came, the shepherds, the goatherds came.
All kept asking, what harm had befallen him.
Priapus came and said, ‘ Wretched Daphnis, why pinest thou?
And beyond-help.
Thou wast called indeed a herdsman, but now art thou like a 23 goat-feeder 'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.‘
And thou too, when thou beholdest the maidens, how they smile, wastest away in thine eyes, because thou dancest not with them.'
But to these the herdsman answered no­ thing ;
but kept going-on-with his own bitter love, and kept going-on-with it to the end of destiny.
Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
Ay and there came indeed sweetly, even Venus smiling, 24 smiling indeed secretly-but cherishing severe anger;
and said she, ‘ Thou indeed, Daphnis, didst boast that thou 25 wouldst bend Love!
Hast not thou, in thine own person, been bent by grievous love ?
'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
And Daphnis, I wot, answered her thus, , Harsh Venus, Venus to be dreaded, Venus hateful to mortals:
—for at length all things declare that my sun is setting :
26 Daphnis even in the shades will be a bitter grief of Love.'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
27‘ As to Venus, is not-the herdsman said-Away to Ida.
Go to Anchises.
There (in Ida) are sheltering oaks, here only marsh plants.
Here bees buzz sweetly at the hives.' ./Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
28‘ Adonis too in the prime of youth, since he too tends sheep, both strikes down hares, and hunts all wild beasts.
’Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
29 ‘ See thou go take thy stand again in close combat with Diomed, and say, I conquer the herdsman Daphnis, come contend with me.
'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
'Ye wolves, ye lynxes, ye bears lurking-in-dens along the mountains, farewell!
For you no more is the herdsman Daphnis along the wood:
no more up and down the oak­ coppices or the groves.
Farewell Arethusa;
and ye rivers, that pour beautiful water down 30 Thymbris.
'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
'Here am I, that Daphnis, who tend heifers hereabouts :
31 Daphnis, who lead the bulls and calves to water in these parts.
'Begin, dear Muses, begin the pastoral strain.
‘0 Pan,
Pan, if thou art on the long mountain ranges of Lycæus, or if thou art engaged on 32 great Mænalus, come thou to the Sicilian isle, and leave the foreland 33 of Helice, and that lofty tomb of the son of Lycaon, which is admirable even to the blest immortals.
'34 Cease, Muses, come cease the pastoral strain.
‘Come, 0 king, and bear off this beautiful pipe sweetly smelling from the well-fastened wax, curved about the mouth- piece ;
for in truth I am by Love dragged to Hades at last.
'
Cease, Muses, come cease the pastoral strain.
'Now may ye brambles bear violets, and may ye thorns pear them ;
and may 35 the beautiful narcissus flower on the junipers:
and may all things become changed, and the pine bear pears, since Daphnis dies :
and may the stag trail the dogs, and the owls from the mountains contend-in-song with nightingales.
'
Cease, Muses, come cease the pastoral strain.
And he indeed having said thus much, made an end :
and Aphrodite was willing to raise him up :
but all the threads, I ween, had been exhausted by the Fates:
and Daphnis crossed the 36 stream.
The eddy washed away the man who was dear to the Muses, who was not odious to the Nymphs.
Cease, Muses, come cease the pastoral strain.
And give thou me the she-goat and the cup, that I may milk her, and offer a libation to the Muses :
0 hail, hail oftentimes, ye Muses:
and I to you will also at a future time sing more sweetly.
Goatherd.
May thy lovely mouth, Thyrsis, be full of honey, ay full of honey-combs, 37 and mayest thou eat sweet dried-figs from Ægilus, since thou, for thy part, singest better than a cicala.
Lo !
here is the cup for thee :
observe, my friend, how beautifully it smells.
You will think that it has been washed in 38 the fountains of the Hours.
Come hither, Cimætha:
and do you milk her.
And, ye she- goats, skip not, lest the he-goat mount you.
Simaetha, a maid of Syracuse, of middle rank, (70—74,) seeing herself slighted by Delphis, of whom she is enamoured, becomes suspicious and jealous, and strives to regain his love by charms and philters.
At night, by the light of the moon, she holds a magic rite, to which chosen attendants are admitted.
The object of these is, that the per­ son on whom the charm is designed to work, may suffer the same as the inanimate objects used in the ceremonial.
The rite being over, and Thestylis gone, Simætha details the rise and progress of her love, and her suspicions of the faithlessness of Delphis, addressing herself to the Moon, as presiding over the solemnity.
Lastly, she threatens heavy doom to the faithless youth, if he return not to his love for her.
This Idyll with others, the 15th and 28th, treat of town, not country life.
Virgil, in the 8th Eclogue, has borrowed from it largely.
WHERE, pry thee, are my laurels ?
Bring them, Thestylis.
And where the love-charms ?
Crown the pail 1with choicest purple wool!
that I may 2overpower by magic the lover who is cruel to me, for, wretch that he is, 3'tis twelve days since he has ever been to see me:
neither knows he whether I am dead or 4 alive, nor has he knocked-furiously at the doors, being untoward:
surely Eros has gone off with his fickle heart elsewhere, and Aphrodite.
I will go to-morrow to the palæstra of Timagetus, that I may see him, and reproach him for the way in which he treats me.
But now I will compel him to love by magic rites.
However, 5O Moon, shine brightly, for to thee will I sing softly, 0 goddess, and to infernal Hecate, at whom even whelps tremble, as she goeth along the tombs and the dark gore of the corpses.
Hail!
6 frightful Hecate, and be thou with me to the end, making these potions nowise inferior either to those of 7Circè, or of Medea, or the yellow-haired Perimedè.
8
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
9
Meal, look you, is first consumed in the fire:
nay, sprinkle it over, Thestylis;
wretched girl, whither hast thou flown in wits ?
Is it really so then, that I have become, you loathsome creature, an object of malignant joy even to you ?
Sprinkle, and say these words withal, I sprinkle the bones of Delphis.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
10 Delphis has grieved me:
and I burn the laurel over Delphis:
and as it cracks loudly, when it has caught fire, and is suddenly in a blaze, and not even its ashes do we see;
even so may Delphis too waste in flame as to his flesh.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house !11 As I melt this wax by the help of the goddess, so may Myndian Delphis be presently wasted by love:
and as this brazen wheel is whirled round, so may that man be whirled about by the influence of Aphrodite at my doors.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house!
Now will I sacrifice the bran, and thou, 0 Artemis, might- est move the Adamantine god in Hades, and even whatever else is stedfast-in-purpose.
Thestylis, the bitches are howl­ ing for us up and down the city.
12 The goddess is in the cross-roads:
sound the brass with all speed.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
13 Behold, the sea is still, and the breezes are.
still, yet my grief is not still within my bosom:
but I am all on fire for him, who has made wretched me to be base and unmaidenly, instead of a wife.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
14 Thrice I offer a libation, and thrice say I these words, O venerable goddess !
‘Whether woman lies beside him, or even man, may as much of oblivion hold him, as, they say, held Theseus of yore, when in 15 Dia he forgot Ariadne of the beauteous locks.
'
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
16 Hippomanes is a plant among the Arcadians :
after it all the colts and fleet mares along the mountains are mad.
So may I see Delphis also arrive even at this house, like unto a madman, from out the glowing palæstra.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
17 Delphis lost this border from his mantle, which I now, tearing in pieces, throw down on the raging fire.
Alas, alas, grievous Eros, why hast thou drunk out all the dark blood from my flesh, clinging like a leech from the marsh?
18Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
19 For thee, Delphis, having bruised a lizard, to-morrow I will bring a baneful potion.
But now, Thestylis, take you these drugs and smear them above that man's door-post, to which, ay even now, I am bound in affection, (yet he takes no account of me !) and 20say as you spit upon it, I smear the bones of Delphis.
Wheel, draw thou that man to my house.
Now then, being alone, from what source shall I bewail my love ?
Whence shall I begin ?
Who brought this evil upon me?
Anaxo, the daughter of Eubulus, came to me, 21 bearing a basket to the grove of Artemis:
and for her in truth then many other wild beasts were going in procession round about, and among them a lioness.
22
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
And Theucharila, the Thracian nurse of blessed memory, dwelling near my doors, begged and prayed me to go and view the procession, and I, all wretched as I am, followed her, 23 trailing a fair tunic of fine-linen, 24 and having clad myself in the fine robe-and-train of Clearista.25
And when I was now about the middle of the road, where Lycon's house is, I beheld Daphnis and Eudamippus walking together:
and their beards were yellower indeed than the marigold 26 while their breasts shone far more than thou, 0 Moon, since they had but just left the noble toil of the palæstra.
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
27And as I looked, how I maddened, how my heart, wretch­ ed woman that I am, was smitten through:
my beauty too wasted away, and neither did I at all regard that procession, nor did I know how I returned home:
but a disorder of a burning nature exhausted me ;
and I lay on my couch ten days and ten nights.
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
And my skin indeed became like oftentimes to 28 box-wood:
and all my hair fell from my head:
and only skin and bones were left any longer:
and to whose house did I not go ?
Or the home of what old woman, that used incantations, did I29 miss ?
But there was no relief:
and time kept passing fleetly.
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
And so I told my slave the true statement.
'Come now, Thestylis, devise me some remedy for sore disorder.
The Myndian possesses me wholly, wretched woman that I am.
Go then, and watch at the palæstra of Timagetus, for thither he resorts, and there it is pleasant to him to sit.
'
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
'And whensoever you shall have learnt that he is alone, beckon quietly, and say that Simaetha bids thee, and lead him hither.'
Thus spoke I.
And she went and brought to my house the sleek-skinned Delphis.
But, when I beheld him just crossing with light foot the threshold of the door ;
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon;
30 I became more chilled than snow all over, and from my brow perspiration began to stream down, like the southern dews.
Neither was I able to say any thing, not even as much as children in sleep murmur forth, calling to their dear mo­ ther;
but I became stiff in my fair body, all over, like a plaster 31 doll.
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
And when he had looked on me, the cruel man, having fixed his eyes on the ground, sate upon the couch, and as he sate spake thus!
'
Surely, Simaetha, thou hast 32 been as much beforehand with me, inasmuch as thou invitedst me to thy house before that I arrived there, as I in sooth some time ago was beforehand with graceful Philinus in the race.
'Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !‘
For I too would have come, yea, by sweet Eros I would have come, with 33two or three friends immediately at night­ fall, keeping in my bosom the apples 34 indeed of Bacchus, and having on my head a wreath of poplar, sacred shoot of 35 Hercules, twined all round with purple ribbons.
'
Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
'And if indeed ye should have received me, this would have been agreeable, for I am called active and beautiful among all the youths.
And I should have been 36 at rest, if only I had kissed thy beauteous mouth.
But if ye repelled me to some other quarter, and the door was held by a bar, by all means then axes 37 and torches should have come against you.
'Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !
'But now I declare that I owe thanks indeed to Venus first, and after Venus, thou in the second place hast plucked me, maiden, from the fire, by having invited me to this thine house, when I was absolutely half consumed.
For Eros in sooth ofttimes kindles a hotter blaze than even Liparaean Vulcan.
'Observe my love, whence it arose, 0 Lady Moon !‘
And, by the aid of baneful phrensy, he is wont to hurry away both the virgin from her woman's chamber, and the wedded wife having just deserted the warm bed of her hus. band.38'
Thus he indeed spoke.
But I, too-credulous woman having seized his -hand, made him recline on the soft couch.
And quickly body was warmed by body, and our faces grew hotter than before:
and we were whispering sweetly.
And that I may not prate to thee too long, dear Moon, great­ est things took place, and we both reached the object of our desire.
And neither at all did that man find fault with me up to yesterday, nor I on the other hand with him:
but there came to me to-day 39the mother of Philista, her, I mean, who is my flute-player, and of Melixo, to-day, even when the 1 steeds were coursing up to heaven, bearing the rosy-armed dawn from the ocean.
And she told me much else, indeed, and that in sooth Delphis is in love:
but whether again love for a woman possesses him, or for a man, she said that she knows not accurately:
but only thus much, that he 40was pouring forth of unmixed wine to Eros, and at last went hurriedly 41 away:
and she said that he was going to cover that house of his love with wreaths.
These things my friend has told me:
and she is truthful.
For certainly at other times he was wont to resort to me thrice and four times a day:
and often would leave with me the Dorian oil-flask:
but now ᾽tis even twelve days since I have ever seen him.
Has he not.
then some other delight, and has he not forgotten me ?
Now indeed I will compel him by love-charms;
and if he should still vex me also, by the Fates I swear he shall knock at the gate of Hades.
Such baneful drugs I affirm that I am keep­ ing 42for him in a box, having learned them, 0 Queen, from an Assyrian stranger.
But fare thou well, and turn thy steeds, dread Lady, toward ocean.
And I will bear my trou­ ble;
even as I have undertaken.
Farewell, bright complex­ ioned 43 Moon, and farewell, ye other stars, attendants on the chariot of stilly night.
A goatherd, the care of his flock having been intrusted to the shepherd Tityrus, goes to the cave of his sweet-heart Amaryllis;
and there, after many complaints of her estranged affections, endeavours by gifts, entreaties, rage, and threats, to re-awaken her former love for him.
Then, in hopes she may come nearer, and in order to fix her heart and eyes on himself, he sings a sweet melody and recounts the men of old, whose love Venus has favoured.
At last, seeing that she is deaf ever to this, he gives way to despair.
The Scholiast thinks the scene is laid in the country about Croto;
and that Theocritus introduces him­ self under the character of the Goatherd.
But there seem no suffi.
cient grounds for the assumption.
1 I GO a-serenading to Amaryllis;
whilst my goats browse on the mountain, and Tityrus drives them.
Tityrus, beloved by me in the highest degree, feed my she-goats;
and leal them to the fountain, Tityrus;
and mind that tawny Libya a he-goat, lest he butt thee.0 graceful Amaryllis, why do you not any longer pef forth at this cave, and call me, your sweet-heart ?
Do y( really hate me ?
Or is it that, forsooth, when near, I appe:
. to thee, 0 nymph, to be flat-nosed and long-chinned ? 2
Yo will make me hang myself.
3
Lo, I bring thee ten apple, and I plucked them from that tree, from which you ba e me pluck them:
and to-morrow I will bring thee mo:
e. Regard, I pray you, my heart-grieving pain.
41 would I could become your buzzing bee, and so enter into your ca e penetrating the ivy and the fern, with which you are covei d 1 in.
5
Now know I Eros !
cruel god !
Surely he sucked the teat of a lioness, and in a thicket his mother reared him.
For it is he who is consuming me, and wounding me even to the bone.
0 you that look all-beautifully, and yet are alto­ gether stone, 6 0 dark-browed nymph, embrace me, your goat­ herd, that so I may kiss you.
There is sweet delight even in empty kisses.
You will make me immediately pluck into smallpieces the wreath which I am keeping for you, dear Amaryllis, of ivy leaves, having interwoven it with 7 rose- buds and sweet-scented parsley.
0 woe is me!
what will become of me ?
What 8 of me, lost man that I am !
Do you not hear me ?
Throwing off my coat of 9 skins, I will leap into the waves yonder, where Olpis the fisherman is watch­ ing for the tunnies.
And even if I shall not have perished, thy pleasure at all events has been done.
I learned my fate but lately, when upon my bethinking me whether you loved me, 10not even did the poppy leaf coming in contact make a sound, but withered away just so upon my soft arm.
"Agraeo too, the prophetess of the sieve, who was lately going beside the reapers, and sheaving up the corn, told me the true tale, that I indeed am wholly devoted to you;
but you take no account of me.
In truth I am keeping 11 for you a white she- goat with two kids, which also the dark-skinned Erithacis, daughter of Mermnon, has been begging of me:
and I will give it to her, since you play the coquet with me.
12My right eye throbs !
I wonder whether I shall see her ?
I will sing, having reclined here beside the pine.
And haply she may regard me, since she is not made of adamant.
13 Hippo­ menes, when in truth he was desirous to wed the maiden, took apples in his hands and accomplished the race:
and when Atalanta beheld him, how she maddened, how she leapt into the depths of love !
14
The prophet Melampus too drove the herd from Othrys to Pylos:
but she, the graceful mother of sensible Alphesibaea, reclined in the arms of Bias.
And did not Adonis, tending his sheep on the mountains, drive the lovely Venus to such an excess of phrensy, that not even when he is dead, does she deprive him of her bosom ?
Enviable indeed to me is 15 Endymion, who enjoys his change- less sleep:
and I count happy, dear maiden, 16 Jasion, who obtained so many favours, as ye, that are uninitiated, shall not hear.
My head is in pain.
But you do not care.
No more do I sing ;
but I will fall and lie low, and here the wolves shall eat me:
that this may be as sweet honey down your throat.
This Idyll is wholly of a Bucolic and mimic character.
Two hireling herdsmen chat together without any fixed subject of conversation.
The one, Corydon, is tending the herds of Ægon, who has become a wrestler and gone with Milo to the Olympic games.
The other, Bat­ tus, is a man of a sarcastic turn, and keeps annoying his fellow with various sharp sayings;
above all, predicting death to the ill-tended herds of Ægon.
Corydon, being easy and good-tempered, answers him mildly.
While they are chatting, the calves bark the straying olive branches, and Battus, driving them off, is pricked by a thorn.
While Corydon is tending his wound, they spy the old father of AEgon, and get into a smart talk about his wanton way of living.
This Idyll abounds in pictures of pastoral life and manners.
Its scene is laid in the country, at the foot of an olive-clad hill.
Virgil imitates it in his third Eclogue, together with the next Idyll.
Battus.
1 TELL me, Corydon, whose are these heifers ?
Are they the property of Philondas ?
Corydon.
No !
but of Ægon !
and he gave them to me to tend.
Batt. 2
Do you happen any where to milk them all by stealth at even ?
Coryd.
Nay, the old man puts the calves to their dams to suck, and watches me.
Batt.
And to what quarter has the cowherd himself dis­ appeared ?
Coryd.
Have you not heard ?
Milo has gone off with him to the 3 Alphous.
Batt. 4
Why, when has that fellow seen oil with his eyes ?
Coryd.
They say that in strength and force he vies with Hercules.
Batt.
And so my mother said that I was better than Pollux.
Coryd.
5
And he is gone off with a hoe, and twenty sheep from hence.
Batt. 6 Milo, methinks, would persuade the wolves too to rave straightway.
Coryd. 7
But the young heifers here show their loss of him, by lowing.
Batt. 8
Ay, wretched are they !
How bad a cowherd they have found !
Coryd.
9
Why yes, in very truth they are wretched:
and they no longer care to feed.
Batt. 10
Now of yon calf look you there is nothing but the bones left.
Does she 11 feed on dew-drops, like the cicada ?
Coryd.
No! by earth.
Sometimes I put her to graze near the 12 Æsarus, and give her a nice wisp of soft grass;
and at other times she frolics in the neighbourhood of shady Latymnus.
Batt.
Lean too is yon red bull?
I would the members of the 13Lamprian deme, look you, might light on such an one, when they sacrifice to Juno :
for the deme is 14 in bad case.
Coryd. 15
And yet he is driven to the salt-water lake, and to the ground about Physcus, and to the river Neæthus, where all beautiful plants grow, cammock, and 16 flea-bane, and sweet-smelling baulm.
Batt.
Fie, fie!
these heifers also, 0 wretched Ægon, will go to Hades, since you too have become enamoured of an evil victory ;
and the pans-pipe, which you formerly put together, is besprinkled with mould.
Coryd. 17 Nay, not it!
no, by the Nymphs:
since as he was going off for Pisa, he left it to me for a gift:
and I am Is some­ what of a minstrel.
And well indeed do I play the prelude to the songs of 19 Glauca, and well to those of Pyrrhus.
I celebrate Croton also :
and a fair city is Zacynthus too :
and I celebrate 20 Lacinium which looks eastward, where the boxer AEgon devoured, all alone, eighty cheese-cakes :
and there he seized by the hoof and brought from the mountain the bull, and gave it to Amaryllis :
and the women cried out loudly, whilst the herdsman laughed aloud.
Batt. 0 graceful Amaryllis, of thee alone, not even though thou art dead, shall we be forgetful:
21 dear as are my goats to me, so wast thou dear who hast died.
Alas, alas for the exceeding hard fate which has possessed itself of me !
Coryd.
One ought to take heart, friend Battus :
perchance 'twill be better to-morrow.
22 Hopes are among the living :
and the dead are beyond hope.
And Jove is one while indeed fair, whilst at another time he rains.
Batt.
I take heart.
23 Drive down yon calves :
for the wretched creatures are nibbling the young shoots of the olive.
St! away, you white-skin !
Coryd.
Away, Cymætha, to the hillock.
Don't you hear me ?
I will come, yes, by Pan, and soon make a bad end to you, if you do not get away from that!
See, she is stealing back again thither.
I would I had my crooked staff, that a might strike thee.
Batt.
Look at me, Corydon, I pray you 24 by Jove.
For the thorn has 25 just struck me here under the ancle :
and how deep these 26 thistles are.
A plague upon the heifer.
I was wounded in gaping after her.
Pray do you see it ?
Coryd.
Yes, yes, and I have it in my nails :
and here it is.
Batt.
How slight is the wound !
and how great a man it brings low !
Coryd.
When you go to the mountain, come not unshod, Battus :
for on the mountain flourish both 27 prickly shrubs and white thorns.
Batt.
Come tell me, Corydon, does the little old man still court that dark-eyebrowed love of his, with whom he was formerly smitten ?
Coryd.
Ay to the full, 0 wretch.
Only lately at any rate I myself;
having come upon him, surprised him by the fold when he was at work.
Batt.
Well done, lecher !
thy race in sooth closely rivals either the Satyrs or the thin-shanked Pans.
Two hirelings, one of Eumaras, a goatherd of Sybaris, the other of a shep­ herd of Thurium, meeting each other with their flocks, mutually pro­ voke a conflict of words.
At last, after many recriminations, the one challenges the other to a contest in singing:
and when they have disputed much about the prize for the victor, and the spot for the trial, they fetch one Morson, a woodcutter, for umpire.
They engage in an Amæbæan or alternate strain, in which, with no fixt subject, they wander through various topics,, supplied either by the condition of the singers, the nature of the country and spot, the memory of the past, or by their very anger and inclination.
At last Morson adjudges the prize to Comatas ;
who, on receiving it, brags of it proudly, and promises to offer a victim to the Nymphs.
Much of this Idyll, though not to the taste of our more refined age, is yet eminent for its poetic power and lively colouring of rustic manners.
Its scene is a glade near Sybaris in Lower Italy.
Virgil has gathered from the Idyll many of the verses, as well as the plan, of his third Eclogue.
Comatas.
My she-goats, shun yon, shepherd of 1 Sybartas, Lacon :
yesterday he stole my goat-skin.
Lacon. 2 St!
Won't you be off from the fountain, my lambkins ?
Do you not spy Comatas, that lately stole my pipe?
Com.
What sort of pipe, pray ?
Why, when did you, slave of Sybartas, get possession of a pipe?
3
And why are you no longer content to have a pipe of straw, and to hiss on it, with Corydon ?
Lac.
'Tis one which Lycon gave me, 4 my gentleman !
but what sort of goat-skin in the world have I, Lacon, stolen from you and gone off with ?
Tell me, Comatas :
for not even had your master Eumaras one to sleep on.
Com.
That which Crocylus gave me, the spotted one, when he had sacrificed the she-goat to the Nymphs:
5 but you, rascal, were even then wasting yourself away with envy, 6 and now at last you have stripped me of it.
1Lac. Nay, in truth, nay, by Pan who frequents the shore, I, Lacon, the son of 7Calcethis, have not robbed you, at any rate of your goat-skin:
or else, my man, may I leap down yon rock madly into the Crathis.
8Com.
No, in truth, no, by these Nymphs of the marsh, my good sir :
and may they be both propitious and benevolent to me !
I, Comatas, did not secretly steal your pipe.
Lac.
Could
I believe you, I would undertake the sorrows of Daphnis.
But however, if you choose to stake-a kid, 9 (for 'tis nothing wonderful!) why then I will go on contending with you in song, until you shall have cried " enough.
"Com. 10
The sow strove a strife with Minerva !
See, there lies the kid:
11 but come, do you match against it the well-fed lamb.
Lac.
And pray how, thou shameface ;
will these terms be fair between us ?
Whoever sheared for himself hair instead of wool ?
and who, when a goat that has borne her first young is at hand, 12 prefers to milk a filthy bitch ?
Com.
Whosoever is confident, as you are, that he shall surpass his neighbour, a buzzing wasp against a cicala.
But however the kid is no equal stake to thee :
do you contend ;
for lo, here is the he-goat.
Lac.
Be in no hurry :
13for you are not scorched by fire :
you will sing more sweetly, when you have taken your seat here under the wild olive and these groves:
there cool water flows down :
here springs herbage, and here is a bed of grass, and the locusts chirp here.
14Corn.
Nay, I do not hurry at all!
but I am greatly annoy­ ed, since you, whom once, when you were yet a boy, I used to teach, dare now to look me 15 straight in the face.
See to what the favour comes !
Rear even wolf's 16 whelps, rear dogs, that they may eat you.
Lac.
And when do I remember to have learned or even heard from you aught good, 0 you envious and absolutely disgraceful mannikin ?
Com. 17 * * * * * * * * * * * *# * * * * * Lac. * * * * *
*But however come, come hither, and you shall sing pas­ torals for the last time ?
Com. 18 I will not approach thither !
here are oaks :
here is ' galingale:
' 19 here bees buzz sweetly at their hives.
Here are two fountains of cool water, and the birds on the trees are chirping :
and the shade is nowise like that with you:
but the pine also showers down cones from above.
Lac. 20
In good truth here you shall tread upon lamb-skins and wool, if you shall have come, softer than slumber:
where­ as the goat-skins that are beside you smell stronger than even you smell:
21 and I will set up a great bowl of white milk in honour of the Nymphs:
and I will set also another of sweet oil.
Corn.
But if you shall come, too, here you shall tread soft fern, and flowering 22 penny-royal:
and underneath shall be skins of kids, four times as soft as your lambs.
And I will set up to Pan eight pails of milk, and eight bowls of honey having full combs.
Lac. Contend with me there :
and there sing your pastoral.
Treading your own ground keep to the oaks.
23 But who, who shall judge us?
Would that by hap the herdsman Lycopas would come hither.
Com.
I want nothing of him.
But if you will, we will call in the oak-cutter who is gathering the heather there beside you.
And it is Morson.
Lac.
Let us shout.
Com.
Call you him.
Lac. Come, friend, come hither and listen a little, for we are contending which is the better pastoral minstrel.
But do not you, good Morson, either decide on me by favour, nor on the other hand, help this man as far as you are concerned.
Corn.
Yes, by the Nymphs, dear Morson, neither assign the advantage to Comatas:
nor do you for your part favour this man here.
This, look you, is the flock of Sybartas of Thu­ rium, and you see, friend, the goats of Eumaras, the Sy­ barite.
Lac.
Did any one ask you, by Jove, whether 'tis the flock of Sybartas or my own, most worthless fellow ?
how babbling you are !
Com.
My most worthy sir, I indeed am declaring the whole truth, and am not bragging at all:
but you are too fond of jeering.
Lac. 24 Come, say on, if you have aught to say!
and let the stranger off 25 again with his life to the city.
0 Paean, surely thou wert a talkative fellow, Comatas!
Com. 26 The Muses love me far more than the minstrel Daphnis:
and I sacrificed to them two kids but very lately.
Lac. Well!
Apollo loves me greatly:
and I am feeding a fine ram for him.
But the 27 Carneian festival is even now coming on.
Com.
I am milking the rest of the she-goats with twins except two:
and the damsel beholding me says, Wretched man, do you milk by yourself ?
Lac.
Alas, alas, Lacon fills, look you, nearly twenty baskets with cheese:
and caresses the beardless boy amid the flowers.
Com. 28Clearista too pelts the goatherd with apples, as he drives his goats past:
and cries ‘ hist ' after a sweet fashion.
Lac.
Why me too the shepherd, smooth Cratidas, maddens, as he meets me:
29 and about his neck waves glossy hair.
Com.
But 30 sweet brier and anemone are not to be com­ pared with roses, beds of which grow beside the hedge-rows.
Lac.
Why no, nor are wild-apples with acorns.
The latter indeed have a thin soft bark from the holm-oak ;
but the for­ mer are sweet as honey.
Com.
And I indeed will give presently to the maiden a ring-dove, having taken it from the juniper-for there it broods.
Lac. 31
But I will present to Cratidas, myself, a soft-fleece for a cloak, whensoever I shall have shorn the dusky sheep.
Com. St!
Off from yon wild olive, ye bleating ones:
feed here, at this sloping hillock, where the tamarisks are.
Lac.
Won't you be off there from the oak, you, Comarus !
and you, Cynaetha ?
Ye shall feed here to the east, as Pha­ larus does.
Com.
But I have a pail of cypress-wood, and I have a gob­ let, the work of Praxiteles :
and I am keeping these for my maiden.
Lac.
And I have a dog fond of the flock, which throttles the wolves:
and I am keeping him for the lad, to chase all wild beasts.
Com.
Ye locusts, that overleap my fence, do not spoil my vines, 32 for they are young.
Lac.
Ye cicalas, see how I vex the goatherd!
So ye too, in truth, vex the reapers.
Corn.
I hate the bush-tailed foxes, which are ever going and 33 gathering the grapes of Mi con at evening.
Lac.
And so do I hate the may-bugs, which devour the figs of Philondas, and are borne off with the wind.
Com.
Don't you remember when I beat you, and you, showing your teeth, 34 wriggled famously, and clung to yon oak ?
Lac.
This indeed I do not recollect!
When however once upon a time Eumaras bound you here, and 35 dusted your jacket, that at all events I know very well.
Com.
At length, Morson, some one is growing angry :
Have you not slightly perceived it ?
Go and pluck old squills forthwith from the tomb.
Lac.
I too, Morson, am vexing some one!
ay, and you perceive it.
Go then to 36 the Hales, and dig up the sow­ bread.
Com.
May the 37 Himera flow with milk instead of water !
and mayest thou too, Crathis, grow purple with wine ! 38 and may the yellow-water cresses, look you, bear fruit!
Lac.
And for my sake may the fountain of Sybaris flow with honey !
and, towards dawn, may the maiden in her pitcher 39 draw combs instead of water !
Com.
My goats indeed eat hadder and ægilus, and tread on mastich-twigs, and lie among arbute-trees !
Lac.
But my sheep have at hand baulm to browse, and the wild eglantine, too, blooms in abundance, like roses.
Com.
I love not Alcippe, for but lately she did not kiss me, having caught me 40 by the ears ;
what time I gave her the ring-dove.
Lac.
But I love Eumedes vastly:
for when I held out the pipe to him, he kissed me in a very sweet manner.
Com.
'Tis not right, Lacon, that jays should contend with a nightingale, or 41 hoopoes with the swans :
but you, wretch­ ed man, are prone to strife.
Morson.
I bid the shepherd cease !
And to thee, Comatas, Morson presents the lamb :
and so do you sacrifice to the Nymphs, and presently send a fine portion of meat to Morson.
Com.
I will send it, yes, by Pan.
Wanton now, all my herd of he-goats !
For see how great is the laugh that I also shall raise against this Lacon the shepherd, 42 because at last I have gained the lamb :
I will leap for you to heaven.
Be of good cheer, my horned she-goats:
41 to-morrow I will wash you all in the fountain of Sybaris.
You, sir, the white goat, 44 that butt-with-the-horn, if you molest any of the she goats, I will beat you, yes, before I sacrifice the ewe-lamb to the Nymphs.
Yet he is at it again.
Well, may I become 45 Melan­ thius, instead of Comatas, if I don't beat you.
Damætas and Daphnis, having driven their herds to water, while away the time in Amæbæan strains.
The youths picture Polyphemus seated on a rock overlooking the sea;
and Galatea, his love, on the other hand, sporting in the waves at no great distance from the shore.
Daphnis begins, directing his song to the Cyclops :
and Damætas responds un­ der the character of Polyphemus.
The performance is ended by mu­ tual presents between the swains.
The Idyll is commended by the manner in which the character and temper of the Cyclops is shadowed forth.
Its subject is the same as that of Idyll xi.
Compare also Moschus, Idyll iii. 59—63.DAMÆTAS and Daphnis, the herdsman, once drove the herd to one spot, 1 0 Aratus :
now one of them was reddish in beard, and the other had but half a one:
and both of them, taking their seats at a certain fountain, in summer-time at mid-day, began to sing as follows.
And Daphnis struck up first, since he too was first to challenge.
Daphnis. 2 Galatea, 0 Polyphemus, pelts your flock with apples, calling you the goat-herd inaccessible-to-love :
and you do not regard her, wretched, wretched man, but sit play­ ing sweetly on your pipe.
See again, she is pelting the bitch, which follows you as sheep-watch:
but it is barking, looking toward the sea ;
and the fair waves, as they gently plash, 3 show it running on the shore.
Take care, lest it rush against the legs of the damsel, as she comes forth from the brine, and tear her beauteous flesh.
Yet she, even on the spur of the moment, coquets, like the dried down from a thistle, when the fine summer parches :
and 4 she flies you, if you love her, and if you love her not, pursues you ;
and 5 moves the stone from the line :
for surely, Polyphemus, oft­ times to love what is not fair, seems fair.
And after him Damætas struck up to sing sweetly.
Damætas.
I saw her, yes, by Pan, when she was pelting my.
flock, and she escaped not my notice, no, by my one sweet eye, with which I look till the end of my days;
6 but may the pro­ phet, Telemus, declaring hostile things, 7 carry off to his home what is hostile, that he may lay it up for his children.
However, I myself too, attempting to vex her, do not regard her in turn;
but say, that some other woman possesses me:
and she, when she hears it, is jealous of me, 0 Pæan, and pines away:
8 and she runs wild, peering forth from the sea toward my caves, and toward my flocks.
And I bade my dog bark at her :
for when I was enamoured of her, it used to whine, keeping its nose to her hips.
Now perhaps when she sees me doing this frequently, she will send a messenger.
But I shall shut my doors, until she shall have sworn that she will herself strew for me a beautiful couch 9 on this island.
For 10in truth neither have I so ugly a form as they say I have.
For surely but lately I was looking into the sea (and it was a calm) :
and beautiful indeed my beard, and beautiful my solitary eyeball, (as it has been determined by my judg­ ment,) appeared ;
11 and it reflected a brightness of teeth, whiter than Parian marble.
And that I might not be be­ witched, 12 I spat thrice upon my breast:
for thus the old woman 13 Cotyttaris instructed me to do, who of late used to sing to the reapers in the fields of Hippocoon.
Having sung thus much, Damætas kissed Daphnis ;
and the latter gave the former a pipe, and he a beautiful flute to the latter.
Damætas was playing the flute, and the herdsman Daphnis the pipes.
Forthwith the calves were leaping on soft herbage.
However neither one conquered, but they were unsurpassed.
in this Idyll, one Simichidas is represented describing a celebration of the festival in honour of De meter after harvest, in which he himself and some friends had been engaged at the house of Phrasidamus and Antigenes, on the banks of the Hales.
The former part of the Idyll is a narration of the journey to the feast;
the latter, a description of the feast itself.
On their road, Simichidas and his friends fall in with a goatherd, Lycidas, of great poetic talent, whom they invite to while the length of the way by his song.
He accordingly sings, his love for the boy Ageanax.
After which, Simichidas in turn celebrates the pas­ sion of Aratus for the lad Philinus.
The songs being ended, Lycidas presents Simichidas with a crook, and turns off on another route.
The rest go forward to their proposed destination, where beside the mur­ inuring fountain, in a most delightful spot, they indulge in wine and good cheer.
The scene, according to the Scholiast, is laid in Cos ;
though Heinsius maintains that Sicily is represented.
Theocritus is known to have stayed some time at Cos to hear Philetas, which makes for the Scholiast's view.
It has been supposed that the poet describes himself under the character of Simichidas, and a Cydonian poet of his own day under the name of Lycidas.
Virgil has planned his ninth Eclogue somewhat on the model of this Idyll.1 IT was the time when I and Eucritus were sauntering from the city to the Hales, and with us a third, Amyntas.
For to Ceres both Thrasidamus and Antigenes, two sons of Lycopeus, were preparing the Thalysia;
worthy men, if aught is worthy that springs from the good men of old, being descended both from 2 Clytia and Chalcon himself;
3 he who by his foot raised the fountain Burinna, having planted strongly his knee against the rock :
and beside it, 4the poplars and elms were yielding a grove of shade, 5 overhanging, as they waved, with green foliage.
6
Nor yet had we finished half our way, nor did the tomb of Brasilas yet come in sight to us, when we fell in with a wayfarer, 7 a favourite with the Muses, a man of Cydon, whose name was Lycidas ;
he was a goatherd, nor could any one that looked upon him have mistaken him, for he was exceedingly like a goatherd.
For on his shoulders he wore a 8 tawny skin of a shaggy thick-haired goat, smelling of new rennet:
an old cloak was fastened by a broad belt about his breast;
whilst in his right hand he held a crooked club of wild-olive :
and grinning, he said to me softly with a smiling eye (and laughter played upon his lip) :
9 ‘Simichidas, where, prythee, art thou dragging thy steps at mid-day?
when in sooth even 10the green lizard sleeps on the fences, and the crested larks roam not abroad ?
Art invited and hastening to a banquet ?
or art for storming the wine-vats of some cit ?
since as thou footest it along, every stone rings, as it strikes against 11 thy half-boots.'
Then I answered him, 'Friend Lycidas, all say you are a piper greatly distinguished both among herdsmen and among reapers:
which in truth vastly delights my mind ;
yet in my fancy, I hope to rival you.
Now this is our way to the 12 Thalysia :
for our friends in sooth are making a feast to Demeter of the beautiful robe, offering the first-fruits of their abundance :
since for them, in very bounteous measure, the goddess hath piled the threshing-floor 13 with barley.
But come now, (for our road is in common, and the day is alike ours,) let us sing pas­ torals ;
perhaps the one will gratify the other.
For I 14 too am a clear voice of the Muses, and all men call me an ex­ cellent minstrel;
but I am one not of easy persuasion.
No !
by earth !
for not yet, to my own fancy, do I. surpass in singing either the good 15 Sicelidas from Samos, or Philetas, but strive with them, like a frog among locusts.
'
So spake I, on purpose :
but the goatherd smiling plea­ santly, ‘I give you this 16 club,' quoth he, ‘ because you are a scion of Jove, fashioned altogether for sincerity.
17 For as the architect is odious to me, who attempts to build a house equal to the top of Mount 18Oromedon, so are birds of the Muses, as many as, crowing against the Cbian minstrel, toil to no purpose.
But come, let us commence at once the pastoral strain, Simichidas :
as I will-see now, friend, if this ditty, which I erst finished off on the mountain, suits your taste.
'‘Ageanax shall have a fair voyage to Mitylene, when the south wind chases the moist waves 19 in the season of the Kids at-their-setting, and when 20 Orion rests his feet on the ocean, if haply he shall have rescued Lycidas scorched by Aphro­ dite :
for ardent love of him consumes me.
And halcyons shall 21 smooth the waves, and the sea, and the south-west wind, and the south-east, which stirs the remotest seaweeds:
hal­ cyons, which have been beloved most of birds, whose prey is on the sea, by the green Nereids.
May all things be season­ able to Ageanax, seeking a fair wind for Mitylene:
and may he reach the harbour after a favourable voyage.
22 And I, on that day, crowning my head with a chaplet of dill, or of roses, or even of white 23 violets, will drain from the bowl the 24Pte­ leatic wine, as I recline beside the fire :
and one shall roast me a bean in the flame, and the bed of leaves shall be covered- thickly elbow-deep with flea-bane, and asphodel and curling parsley.
25 Then freely will I drink, in memory of Ageanax, pressing my lip to the very cup even to the dregs.
26 And there shall pipe for me two shepherds, one an Acharnian, and one from Lycope:
and near them Tityrus shall sing, how once the herdsman Daphnis loved the foreign maid, and how he traversed the mountain, and how the oaks bewailed him which grow beside the banks of the river 27 Himeras :
when he wasted away, as any snow on lofty Hæmus, or Athos, or Rhodope, or remotest Caucasus :
he shall sing too how once a wide chest received the goatherd yet living, 28 through the baneful vio­ lence of his master;
and how the flat-nosed bees coming from the meadows to the sweet cedar, were wont to feed him on soft flowers, because the Muses had poured down his throat pleasant nectar.
0 fortunate Comatas, thou in sooth hast experienced these delights, and thou hast been enclosed in a chest, and thou, being fed on the combs of bees, 29hast com­ pleted the spring of the year.
30 Would that in my day thou hadst been numbered among the living, since I would then have tended for thee thy beautiful she-goats, along the mountains, while listening to thy voice :
and thou, divine Comatas, shouldst have reclined under the oaks or under the pines, sweetly singing.
'
And Lycidas having sung thus much, made an end :
but to him in turn I also spoke as follows:
‘Many other good things, friend Lycidas, have the Nymphs taught me too, as I tend my herd along the mountains:
things which 31 haply fame hath carried even to the throne of Jove.
But this at any rate is far pre-eminent beyond all, with which I will proceed to favour you.
Hearken then, since you are a friend to the Muses.'32'
On Simichidas indeed the Loves have sneezed:
for of a truth the luckless wight is as much in love with Myrto, as the she-goats love spring.
But Aratus, who is in the highest degree beloved by that man, cherishes at heart a yearning for a lad.
33 Aristis, a worthy man, and highly excellent, (whose singing with the accompaniment of the lyre not even Phœbus himself beside his tripods would refuse,) knows that by a lad Aratus,is consumed to the very bone with love.
Him I pray thee, 0 Pan, who hast obtained for thy portion the lovely surface of 34 Homole, mayest thou place unbidden in the dear hands of that man, whether it is in sooth the tender Philinus, or some other. !
And -if indeed thou shouldst do thus, 0 dear PaD, then may 35 Arcadian boys in no wise scourge thee with squills on ribs and shoulders, at such times as scanty feasts are provided:
but shouldst thou have decided otherwise, mayest thou be scratched all over thy flesh by the nails, and mayest thou sleep among nettles:
and in mid-winter mayest thou be on the 36mountains of the Edonians, beside the river Hebrus, facing towards and nigh to the north ;
and in summer mayest thou tend herds among the extremest Æthi­ opians, 37 under the rock of the Blemyes, whence the Nile is no longer to be seen.
But do ye, having left the sweet water of 38 Hyetis and Byblis, and dwelling in the lofty 39 seat of golden-haired Dione, 40 0 Loves like unto ruddy apples, strike, I pray you, with your arrows, the lovely Philinus :
strike, for the wretched youth pities not my guest.
And yet he is more over-ripe than a pear, and the women say, Alas, alas, Philinus, thy beauty's bloom wastes away.
No longer, look you, Aratus, let us keep watch at the vestibules, nor wear out our feet, but let the early cock consign 41 another, as he crows, to this painful numbness :
and let Molon alone, my best of friends, be harassed in this sharp exercise:
and to us let both quietness be a care, and an old woman be at hand, who, 42 by spitting, may keep afar off what is not good.
'
Thus much I spoke:
and he, having smiled sweetly, as before, presented me with his crook to be a friendly gift 43arising out of our songs.
And he indeed, having turned off to the left, proceeded on his way to Pyxa:
but I and Eucritus, having bent our steps to the house of Phrasidamus, with the beautiful 44 Amyntichus, reclined there, both.
on deep low­ couches of the sweet mastich-tree, and on fresh-cut vine-twigs, rejoicingly.
And, from above, down upon our heads were waving to and fro many poplars and elms ;
and the sacred stream hard by kept murmuring, as it flowed down from the cave of the Nymphs.
And the fire-coloured cicalas on the shady branches were toiling at chirping;
while, from afar off, in the thick thorn-bushes the thrush was warbling.
Tufted larks and 45 gold-finches were singing ;
the turtle-dove was cooing ;
46 tawny bees were humming round about the foun­ tains :
all things were breathing-the-incense of very plenteous summer, and breathing-the-incense of fruit-time.
47 Pears indeed at our feet, and by our sides apples, were rolling for us in abundance ;
and the boughs hung-in-profusion, weighed down to the ground, with damsons.
48 Moreover the pitch of four years' date was loosened from the mouth of the wine jars.
Ye Castalian Nymphs, inhabiting the height of Parnassus, I wonder whether 49 at all in the rocky cave of Pholus, aged Chiron set up for Hercules a goblet such as this !
I wonder if haply 'twas nectar like this, which induced that shepherd by the Anapus, the strong Polyphemus, who 50 used to hurl crags on the mountain-ranges, to dance about in the sheep­ pens ?
Such nectar I mean, as, 0 Nymphs, ye then broached, beside the altar of Demeter presiding over the threshing-floor:
on the heap of which may I again fasten a great winnowing shovel, and may she smile, holding in both hands 51 wheat sheaves and poppies.
In this Idyll two pastors are represented as contending, Daphnis and Menalcas, both skilled in music and in Amæbæan song.
A challenge is given, and a prize set up, and a goatherd called in as umpire.
They begin the song, so as to answer one another first with four, afterwards with eight verses each.
At last the goatherd adjudges the prize to Daphnis—and the poet represents this victory as laying the foundation of all the future fame of Daphnis, in pastoral poetry.
The scene is laid in Sicily.
Virgil has copied this Idyll much in Eclogues iii.
and vii.
MENALCAS, 1as they say, whilst tending his sheep along the high mountains, fell in with the graceful Daphnis a-driving his herd.
2
Now both of them were 3 red-haired, both lads :
each skilled in playing on the pipes, each in singing.
And first then Menalcas, gazing at Daphnis, addressed him.
Menalcas.
Daphnis, watcher of the lowing oxen, wilt thou sing with me ?
I maintain that I will beat you at singing, to my heart's content.
And him, I ween, Daphnis answered in speech like the following.
Daphnis.
Shepherd of woolly sheep, piper Menalcas, you at all events shall never beat me in singing, no, not if you should die for it.
Men. 4
Are you desirous then to see into it ?
Are you desirous to stake a prize ?
Daph.
I do desire to see into this.
I am desirous to stake a prize.
Men.
Well what shall we stake, that would be of sufficient value for us ?
Daph.
I will stake a calf :
and do you stake on your part 5 a lamb like its mother.
Men.
6I will never stake a lamb, for both ray father is strict, and my mother, and they count all the sheep at evening.
Daph.
Well then, what will you stake ?
And what shall be the advantage the winner shall have ?
Men. 7
A shepherd's-pipe, which I made beautiful with nine notes, and having white wax about it, equal below, equal above.
This I would stake :
but my father's property I will not stake.
Daph.
In truth I too, look you, have a pipe with nine notes, haying white wax about it, equal below, equal above.
I lately fastened it together.
Even still I have a pain in this finger, since the reed, i'fegs, split and cut me.
But who shall try us ?
Who shall be our listener ?
Men.
How if we should call hither yon goatherd, whose dog 8 with-the-white-spot, is barking near the kids.
And the youths indeed shouted to him, and the goatherd came, having heard them.
And the youths on their part be­ gan to sing, and the goatherd was willing to be umpire.
So then first the 9 piper Menalcas proceeded to sing, having ob­ tained precedence by lot.
And then Daphnis took up the alternate pastoral strain.
And thus began Menalcas first.
Men.
Ye dells and rivers, 10a divine progeny, if haply ever the piper Menalcas has sung a pleasant melody, may ye feed my lambkins 11to my heart's content:
and should Daphnis ever chance to have come with his calves, may he find nothing less.
Daph.
Ye springs, and herbage, a pleasant growth, if so be that Daphnis warbles like the nightingales, fatten ye this herd!
And if Menalcas shall have driven any stock hither, may he, to his satisfaction, pasture all in plenty.
Men. 12
Every where it is spring, and every where are pas­ tures :
and every where udders are full of milk, and the young are suckled, where the fair maiden approaches:
but if she should depart, both the shepherd is withered there, and the herbage too.
Daph.
Sheep are there, she-goats with twins are there, bees fill their hives there, and the oaks are loftier, wherever the handsome Milo sets foot;
13 but should he depart, both he who feeds the heifers, and the heifers themselves, are the more dried up.
Men. 0 he-goat, husband of the white she-goats !
14 where there is endless depth of foliage, 0 ye flat-nosed kids, come hither to the water.
For in that place is he!
Go, stump-horn, and say to Milo, that 15 Proteus, even though a god, used to feed sea-calves.
Daph.
Not mine be it to possess the land of Pelops, nor mine to own golden talents, or to outstrip the winds:
but I will sing under this rock, holding thee in my arms, 16looking upon my sheep feeding together, and towards the Sicilian sea.
Men.
To trees indeed winter is a dreadful evil, and to waters drought, and to birds the snare, and to wild beasts nets:
but to man the yearning for a tender maiden.
0 Sire, O Jove, not I alone have been in love.
17 Thou too art a lover of women.
'These strains indeed then the youths sang alternately:
and Menalcas thus commenced his concluding song.
Men.
Spare my kids, spare, wolf, my she-goats with young, and do not hurt me, because, small though I am, I tend many.
18 0 dog Lampurus, does so deep a sleep hold you ?
You ought not to sleep soundly while tending sheep with a lad.
And, ye sheep, neither do you shrink from filling yourselves with the tender herbage.
Ye shall be nowise tired of it, when this springs up again.
St! feed on, feed on, and, all of you, fill your udders, that the lambs may have a part, and I may lay up the rest in cheese baskets.
Next in turn, Daphnis struck up to sing sweetly.
Daph. 19 Me too, a maiden with meeting eye-brows, having seen yesterday from her cave, as I drove past it my heifers, kept declaring to be beautiful, beautiful.
Nor indeed did I even answer her a rude word, but kept trudging on my way, looking downwards.
20 Sweet is the voice of the heifer, sweet the breath of the pipe;
and sweetly too the calf lows, and sweetly also the cow:
and sweet is it 21 in summer-time to sleep in the open air beside running water.
22 The acorns are an ornament to the oak, apples to the apple-tree, and to the cows the calf, the cows themselves to the herdsman.
Thus sang the youths, but the goatherd addressed them as follows:
Goatherd.
Something sweet is thy mouth, and lovely thy voice, 0 Daphnis.
'Tis better to hear thee sing than 23to sip honey.
Take the pipe, for thou hast won in singing.
And if at all you desire to teach me too to sing, while I feed my goats along with you, I will give you, as the price of your teaching, yon hornless she-goat, which always fills the milk- pail above the brim.
As then the youth was delighted, and leapt up, and shouted as victorious;
so would a fawn leap upon its dam.
And as the other smouldered away, and was cast down in heart by chagrin, so also would a nymph grieve, 24when betrothed.
And from this time, Daphnis became first among shepherds, and, while yet in earliest youth, wedded a Naiad nymph.
The scene is laid in Sicily.
Daphnis and Menaleas are challenged by a companion shepherd to contend with one another in singing.
They sing in alternate strains, and each carries off a prize;
Daphnis a crook, and Menalcas a muscle-shell.
It seems clear that the whole Idyll is put in the mouth of a shepherd, who narrates the alternate strains of Daphnis and Menalcas, just as Melibæus (Virg. Ecl. vii.) those of Corydon and Thyrsis.
Warton observes that Menalcas in his song assumes the character of the Cyclops.
SING a pastoral strain, Daphnis, and do you first begin the song;
begin you the 1 song, first, and let Menalcas follow after, when you have put the calves to the heifers, and the bulls to the barren cows.
And let them feed together, and stray among the foliage, 2not at all forsaking the herd :
but do you sing me a bucolic strain in the first place ;
and in the next, in turn let Menalcas answer.
Daphnis.
Sweetly indeed the calf lows, and sweetly too does the heifer;
and sweetly also the pipe sounds, and the herdsman, and sweetly I too.
And by the cool water-side I have a couch of leaves;
and on it have been strown beautiful skins from white heifers, all of which, to my sorrow, as they nibbled the 3arbute-tree, the south-west wind dashed from the mountain peak.
And I care as much for the parching summer 4as lovers care to hear the words of a father or mother.
Thus sang Daphnis to me.
And Menalcas thus.
Menalcas.
Ætna is my mother, and I inhabit a fair cave in the hollow rocks:
and I have in sooth whatever things appear in a dream, 5many sheep and many goats ;
of which the skins lie at my head, and beside my feet.
And on a fire of oak­ boughs entrails are boiling, and on the fire are dry beech- fagots when it is winter ;
and in truth not even have I a care for winter, as much as a toothless person has for nuts, when 6fine meal is at hand.
These indeed I applauded ;
and straightway gave as a pre­ sent, to Daphnis on one hand a crook, which a field of my father's had raised for me, self sprung, and such as not even perhaps a carpenter would have found fault with;
and to the other 7 a beautiful spiral cockle-shell, the flesh of which I my­ self had eaten, after I had 8 lain in wait for it on the Icarian rocks, having divided 9 five shares for five of us;
and he (Men­ alcas) blew upon the shell.
Pastoral Muses, all hail!
and bring to light the song, which formerly I sang in the presence of those herdsmen.
10Never raise a pimple upon the tip of your tongue.
11Cicala is dear to cicala, and ant to ant, and hawks to hawks:
but to me the Muse and song :
of which, I pray, may all my house be full, for neither 12 sleep, nor spring on a sudden, is more sweet, nor flowers to bees, than are the Muses dear to me :
for whomso­ ever they behold with pleasure, such hath 13 Circe never at all hurt with her draught.
In this Idyll, which is strictly pastoral, Milo and Battus, two reapers, converse over their work.
Now Battus, being enamoured of a female flute-player, Bombyce, the daughter of Polybutas, or as some suppose his handmaiden, works but slackly in consequence.
Whereupon Milo asks him why he reaps so lazily, and Battus confesses to him his love;
and recites a ditty composed for his mistress.
Milo then opposes to this song, another of his own, containing precepts on the art of reaping, having first applauded Battus for the fitness and beauty of his composition.
You labouring ploughman, what has befallen you now, wretched man ?
Neither can you 1draw the swathe straight, as of old you used to draw it;
nor do you reap in a line with your neighbour, but are left behind, as a sheep, whose foot a thorn has wounded, is left by the flock.
A fine sort of reaper you will be, won't you, at evening, and after mid-day, seeing that now, when you begin, 2 you do not make a gap in the swathe ?
Battus.
Milo, you who reap till late at even, fragment of stubborn rock, did it never befall you to long after one of the absent ?
Milo.
Never !
And what business has a labouring man with longing after those that are without ?
Batt.
Did it never then chance to you to lie awake through love ?
Mil.
No, and I trust it never may.
3 It's bad to give a dog a taste of guts.
Batt.
Well, but I, Milo, have been in love hard upon eleven days.
Mil.
You evidently draw from the cask !
4 but I have not vinegar enough.
Batt. 5
Therefore all before my doors is unweeded since sowing time.
Mil.
And which of the damsels is ruining you ?
Batt.
The maiden of Polybotas, 6 who lately used to play to the reapers in the fields of Hippocoon.
Mil. 7
The god has found out the sinner !
you have what you have been long wanting.
8
The long-legged grasshopper will lie with you all night.
Batt.
You are beginning to jeer at me.
But not 9 only Plutus is blind, but also the reckless Love.
Do not say any thing boastful.
Mil.
I do not boast at all.
10 Only do you lay low the crop ;
and strike up some loving ditty on the maiden ;
so will you work more pleasantly ;
and in fact in former times you used to be musical.
Batt. Pierian Muses, sing with me of the slim damsel:
for, O goddesses, ye make all things beautiful, whichsoever ye shall have touched.
11 Graceful Bombyce, all call thee Syrian, and shrivelled, and sun-burnt;
but I alone call you 12 honey-complexioned.
The violet too is dark, 13 and the inscribed hyacinth ;
yet still they are gathered the first in garlands.
The she-goat follows 14 the cytisus, the wolf the she-goat, and the 15 crane the plough:
but I am maddened after you.
16 I would I had as much as they say Crœsus of yore possessed;
then both of us wrought in gold should be dedicated to Aphrodite;
you holding the flute indeed, and either a rose, yes, or an apple;
and I wear­ ing 17 a new dress, and new Amyclæan shoes on both feet.
0 graceful Bombyce, 18 thy feet indeed are well turned, and thy voice is soft.
Thy manners however I am not able to express.
Mil.
Surely the ploughman has escaped my notice while making beautiful songs;
how well has he measured the form of his harmony!
19Alas me!
for the beard which I have nursed in vain.
Consider now also the strains of the divine Lytierses.20 0 fruitful Demeter, rich in ears of corn, may this field be well tilled, and fruitful in the highest degree.
Bind up, reapers, the sheaves, lest haply a passer-by should say, 21 good-for-nothing fellows, this hire too is thrown away.
Let the swathe of your mown-grass look to the north or west:
thus the ear fills out.
22 Threshers of corn should avoid sleeping at mid-day :
then, most of all, chaff comes from the stalk.
Reapers ought to begin at the rising of the crested lark, and to cease when it goes to rest:
but to keep holiday during the heat.
The life of the frog is to be prayed for, my boys.
He does not care for one to pour out liquor;
for it is at hand for him in abundance.
It is better, miserly bailiff, to cook the lentil.
23 Don't cut your hand in splitting the cummin.
These couplets it behoves men labouring in the sun to sing:
and 'tis meet that you should tell, 0 rustic, your starved love to your mother lying awake in bed in the morning.
This Idyll commences with a preface to Nicias, a physician of Miletus, (to whom Theocritus inscribes the 13th Idyll, and of whom he makes favourable mention in Idyll xxviii. 6, and Epigr. vii. 3,) respecting the power of song in relieving the pains of disappointed love.
The Cyclops is represented as using this solace for his hopeless passion for Galatea.
Polyphemus, sitting on a rock overhanging the sea, beguiles his hours with song.
He accuses the fair one of pride, and scorn for his deep devotion to her;
and boasts of the gifts of fortune, which he can show, in lieu of gifts of beauty and personal grace.
At last he seems to recover from his infatuation, perceiving the vanity of his hopes.
Virgil has had this Idyll in his eye, while writing Eclogues ii.
and ix.:
and Bion perhaps gathered from it some ideas for the first part of his 15th Idyll.
Compare Ovid Met. xiii. 755, &c., and Callimach. Epigr. xlix. p. 316 (Ernesti).1 THERE is no other remedy for love, 0 Nicias, either 2 in the way of salve, as it seems to me, or of plaster, except the Muses :
but this is a light and sweet thing amongst men, yet 'tis not easy to find.
But methinks you know it well, as being a physician, and in truth a man especially beloved by the nine Muses.
Thus, for instance, the famous Cyclops our countryman, the ancient Polyphemus, used most easily to pass his time, when he was enamoured of Galatea, just as he was now getting a beard about his mouth and temples.
And he was wont to love,­ not at all with roses, or apples, or locks of hair, but with un­ done fury:
and he held all things secondary to his fury.
3
Oft­ times his sheep went back by themselves to the fold from the green herbage ;
whilst he, singing his.
Galatea, pined away' there, on the sea-weedy shore, from break of day, having beneath his breast a most hateful wound inflicted by mighty Venus, 4since she had fastened an arrow in his heart.
5
But he found his remedy, and sitting upon a high rock, looking to­ wards the sea, he was wont to sing such strains as this.'0 fair Galatea, why dost thou spurn thy lover?
6More white than cream-cheese to look upon, more tender than a lamb, more frisky than a calf, more sleek than an unripe grape ?
And you come hither just so, when sweet sleep'pos­ sesses me, but you are straightway gone, when sweet sleep leaves me;
7 and you fly me, like a sheep when it has spied a gray wolf.
8I for my part became enamoured of you, damsel, when first you came with my mother, desiring to cull from the mountain hyacinthine flowers;
and I was acting as your guide.
But to stop, when once I had beheld you, and after­ wards, and even at present, from that time I am unable.
Yet you do not care, no, by Jove, not a whit.
I know, graceful maiden, on account of what you avoid me, 9 because a shaggy eyebrow stretches all over my forehead, from one ear to another, as one great one ;
and one eye is upon my brow, and a broad nostril over the lip.
Yet this same I, being such as you see, 10feed a thousand sheep, and from these, milking them, I drink the best milk.
And cheese fails.
me not, either in summer, or in autumn, or in the depth of winter;
but the baskets are always overbur­ dened.
I am skilled too in playing on the pipes, as no one of the Cyclops here;
singing thee, 11my dear sweet-apple, and myself at the same time, 12 oftentimes early in the night.
And I am rearing for you eleven fawns, all of them 13 wearing collars, and four cubs of a bear.
Nay, then, come you to me, and you shall have nothing worse ;
and suffer the pale-green sea to roll up to the beach :
14you will pass the night with me in my cave more sweetly.
15 There are laurels and tapering cypresses, there is black ivy, and the vine with its sweet fruit;
there is cool water, which wooded Ætna sends forth for me, a diving drink, out of white snow:
(who would prefer to these delights to dwell in sea or waves ?)
But if in truth I seem to you to be rather shaggy, I have oak-branches near, and unresting fire under the embers.
And I could endure to be scorched by you even to my very soul, 16 and that single eye, than which nothing is more dear to me.
17Woe is me, that my mother did not bring me forth having gills, in which case I should have come down to you, and have kissed your hand, if you would not your lips, and I should be 18 bringing you either white lilies, or the soft poppy with red petals.
But the one springs in summer, and the other in the winter, so that I should not have been able to bring you all these together.
Now indeed, dear maiden, yes, now on the spot I will learn to swim, if so be 19 that any foreigner arrive hither, sailing in his ship, that I may learn what possible delight it is to you to dwell in the water-depths.
Mayest thou come out, Galatea, and having come forth, forget (as I do now sitting here) to go away home :
20 and mayest thou wish to feed flocks with me, and to milk along with me, and to press cheese, infusing sharp runnet.
My mother21 alone wrongs me, and I find fault with her:
not a kind word ever at all has she spoken to you on my behalf, and this too, though she sees me becoming thin day after day.
I will say that my head and both my feet are throb­ bing, that she may be pained, since I too am pained.
22 0 Cyclops, Cyclops, whither hast thou flown in reason ?
If thou wouldst forthwith weave baskets, and mowing the young shoots, bear them to the lambs, perhaps thou wouldst have thy senses in a far greater degree.
23 Milk the ewe that is close at hand !
Why dost pursue the one that flies you ?
24 Haply you will find another Galatea even more beautiful.
25 Many damsels bid me sport with them in the night season, and all of them titter whenever I listen to them.
Plainly even I appear to be somebody on the land.
Thus in sooth Polyphemus used to beguile his love by sing­ ing;
and 26 he passed his days more easily than if he had given money for a cure.
This Idyll, which is of a lyric, not a Bucolic character, has been suspect­ ed to be not the work of Theocritus.
It is an expression of love towards a youth on his return to his friend after three days' absence.
The poet goes on to hope that this love may be mutual and perpetual.
It is ended with a strain in honour of the Megarensians, on account of their having instituted annual kissing-matches at the tomb of Dio­ cles.
For the different opinions of commentators, &c., on the author­ ship of this Idyll, see the edition of Kiessling, London, 1829, at the head of the 12th Idyll.
HAST thou come, dear youth, after three nights and morn­ ings ?
Hast thou come ?
1
Yet those who long, grow old in a day.
As much as spring is sweeter than winter, as much as the apple than the sloe, as much as a sheep is more woolly than its lambkin, as much as a virgin is better than a thrice- wed wife, as much as a fawn is swifter than a calf, as much as a clear-voiced nightingale most musical of all birds toge­ ther ;
so much have you gladdened me 2 by having appeared :
and I have run to thee, as some traveller runs to the shelter of a shady beech when the sun is scorching.
3
Would that the loves might breathe upon both of us evenly, and we might be­ come 'a song' 4 to all who shall come after.‘
In truth, a certain pair of men were thus affected one to- -ward another;
the one 5a lover (εἴσπνηλος), as one, who spoke the Amyclæan dialect, would say;
and the other again the Thessalian would call thus, 6 ‘ the beloved' (ἀΐταν).
And they loved each other with equal yoke.
Surely then, I wot, they, golden men of yore, when he that was loved requited that love.'
Yes, would that this might be, 0 father Jove, would it might be, 0 undecaying immortals;
and 8two hundred gener­ ations afterwards some one might bring word to me, unto Acheron, whence we return not, 'Thy love and that of thy graceful loved one is even now in the mouths of men, and espe­ cially among the youths.'
But in truth, of these things indeed the celestials will be arbiters, as they choose ;
yet I, in praising thee as the beautiful, 9 shall not breed fib-marks on the top of my nose.
For even if you should have pained me at all, you have immediately made the hurt innocent, and doubly gratified me, so I have departed having good measure.
100 Nisæan Megarensians, excelling at the oars, may ye dwell happily, since ye have honoured especially the Attic stranger Diodes, the lover of youths.
Ever about his tomb in crowds, in earliest spring, youths contend to bear off the prize of kisses.
And whoso shall have pressed most sweetly lip to lip, goes back to his mother loaded with garlands.
Happy he, who is arbiter of those kisses for the lads.
Surely, me­ thinks, he oft 12 invokes the gladsome Ganymede, that he may have a mouth like the Lydian stone, by which money-changers try gold, whether it be base or pure.
The poet premising somewhat about the power of love over gods and men, opens the subject of the rape of Hylas with a description of the love and care of Hercules for the lad.
When the Argonauts had put to shore at the land of the Cyanians, on the coast of the Propontis, Hylas was sent by Hercules to fetch water.
Whilst drawing from the fountain, in a lovely spot, he is drawn in by the Nymphs, who are captivated by the exceeding beauty of the boy.
Hercules, suspecting some mishap from the delay of Hylas, sets out in quest of him ;
and as his fruitless search detains him a long time, he is left behind by the Argonauts, who suppose he has quitted them purposely.
The hero goes afoot to Colchis.
This Idyll is Epic in its character, but with such a touch of Bucolic sweetness about it as to win it a high place among the Idylls of Theocritus.
Note the description of the fountain, vs. 40, and the anxiety of the Nymphs to console the lad, 54—59.NOT for us alone, as we used to suppose, my Nicias, did he beget Eros, to 1 whomsoever of the gods this child was once born:
nor to us first, who are mortals, 2 and do not see the morrow, do the things that are beautiful appear to be beauti­ ful.
But even the 3brazen-hearted son of Amphitryo, who sustained the attack of the fierce lion, was enamoured of a lad, 4 the graceful Hylas, that wore the curly locks, and he taught him every thing, as a father would his own child, by having learned which he had himself become good and illustrious:
and he was never apart from him, not even if mid-day were rising, nor when the white-horsed chariot of Aurora was mounting to the halls of Jove, nor when the chirping young birds looked to their nest, their mother having fluttered her wings upon her dusky perch:
in order that the boy might be 5 shapen with care according to his mind ;
and drawing well with him, might turn out a perfect man.
6
But when Jason, son of Æson, was sailing in quest of the golden fleece, and the nobles were following along with him, chosen out of all cities, 7 be­ cause there was some help in them, there came also to rich 8Iolchos the much-enduring son of Alcmene, heroine of 9 Midea.
And with him Hylas went down to the well-benched Argo, which vessel touched 10 not the jostling Cyanean rocks, but shot through, (and ran into deep Phasis :
) like an eagle, a great surge, from out which at that time low rocks stood.
11 And what time the Pleiads rise, and far-away spots are feed­ ing the young lamb-spring having now turned-then the 12 godlike flower of heroes began to recollect the voyage, and having taken their seats in the hollow Argo, came to the Hellespont, 13 at the third day's blowing of the south wind.
And they found an anchorage within the Propontis, where oxen widen the furrows of the Cyanians, as they 14rub the ploughshare.
Having landed then on the shore, they busily prepared a feast 15 at evening by pairs :
and many of them strewed for themselves one couch-on-the-ground.
For by them lay a broad meadow, suitable for beds of leaves.
16 Thence they cut for themselves the sharp flowering-rush and low gal­ ingal.
And the auburn-haired Hylas had gone to fetch water for supper, for both Hercules himself and the staunch Tela­ mon, (both which comrades used alway to 17 feed at one table,) with a brazen vessel;
—and quickly he spied a fountain in a low-lying spot;
and around it grew many rushes, and the pale-blue 18 ‘swallow-wort,' and green ‘maiden-hair,’ and blooming parsley, and couch-grass stretching through the marshes :
and in the midst of the water, Nymphs were mak­ ing ready a dance, sleepless Nymphs, dread goddesses to rus­ tics, 19 Eunica and Malis, and Nychea with a look like spring.
In sooth 20 the boy was holding over the fountain an urn that might contain a copious draught, hastening to plunge it;
when they all clung to his hand:
for love for the Argive boy had encircled the tender hearts of them all:
and 21 he fell sheer into the black water, like as when a ruddy star hath fallen from the sky sheer into the sea, and a sailor has said to his 22 shipmates, ‘Loosen the ship's tackle, my lads, here's a breeze for sailing !'
The Nymphs indeed holding on their knees the weeping boy, began to console him with gentle words;
23whilst the son of Amphitryon, disturbed about the lad, went, with his well-bent bow and arrows 24 after the Scythian fashion, and the club which his right hand ever used to hold.
Thrice indeed he 25 shouted Hylas to the full depth of his throat, and thrice, I wot, the boy 26heard:
and a thin voice came from the water;
but though very near he seemed to be afar off.
27 And as when a well-bearded lion, some savage lion on the moun­ tains, upon hearing a fawn crying afar off, hastes from his lair towards a most ready meal, in such wise Hercules kept moving about among the impassable briers through regret for the lad, and kept ranging over much space.
Hapless are they who love !
How he toiled in roaming over 28 mountains and thickets!
and Jason's enterprise was all secondary to it.
The ship indeed was waiting with its sails floating in air ;
and the youths of 29 them that were present, kept washing the hatches at midnight, in expectation of Hercules :
he however was going madly wherever his feet led him, for a cruel god was tearing his heart inwardly.
30 Thus indeed most beauteous Hylas is numbered one of the blest immortals.
But the heroes began to revile Hercules as a deserter of the ship, because he had withdrawn from Argo of the thirty benches.
And he came a-foot to Colchis, and to 31 inhospitable Phasis.
AEschines, jilted by a maiden of whom he was enamoured, declares to Thyonichus the causes of their quarrel.
This leads to an explanation of his heart-sickness, and especially to an account of the banquet, at which their quarrel had arisen.
After this Æschines declares to his friend his purpose of crossing the seas, to find relief for his griefs. .
Thyonichus approves and urges him to go and serve in the armies of Ptolemy;
of which monarch a graceful eulogy follows.
It seems hence not unlikely that this Idyll, which is not of the pastoral kind, was either composed at Alexandria, or at any rate intended for the eye of the monarch.
Æschines.
GOOD morrow to Sir Thyonichus.
Thyonichus.
1Well, the same to you, Æschines..,EscA.
How late you are !
ThOM.
Late ?
And what is your care, pray ?,EscA.
I am not in the best condition, Thyonichus.
Thyon.
Therefore I suppose you are lean, 2 and that upper lip is covered, and your locks are unkempt.
Such a sort of 3 fellow was a Pythagorean, that arrived here but lately, pale and 4 unsandaled, and he said that he was an Athenian.
In truth that man too, methinks, was longing for baked flour.
Æsch.
5
You are always joking, good sir:
but me the graceful Cynisca wrongs ;
6 and I shall go mad without one knowing it, within a hair's breadth.
Tkyon.
You are ever thus, good Æschines, 7 mild or sharp, wanting every thing on the spur of the moment;
but tell me, however, what news ?
Æsch.
The Argive, and I, and Apis, the Thessalian driver of steeds, and Cleonicus, the soldier, were drinking at my country place.
I had killed a couple of young fowls and a sucking pig, and had broached for them the fragrant Thracian 8 wine, almost four years old, as mild as if from the wine-press.
9 A Colchian mushroom had been brought out:
'twas a sweet drink.
And when the cup was now making way, it pleased us 10that neat wine should be poured forth to the health of whomsoever each chose, only he was bound to say to whose.
We indeed began to drink naming our loves, as it had been determined.
But she said nothing, though I was present.
What mind, think you, had I then?
11 ‘Won’t you speak ?
you have seen a wolf,' said some one sportively, 'as the wise man said.'
Then she fired up ;
you might have lighted even a lamp with ease from her.
'Tis Lycus, yes, Lycus it is, son of Labas our neighbour, tall and delicate, and to the fancy of many, beautiful.
His was that much talked-of love with which she was pining away:
and this had been thus quietly whispered in my ear before:
however I had not inquired into it, 12 to no purpose being a bearded man.
And now then we four were in the depth of our cups, when the Larissæan began to sing 'My Lycus,' from the beginning, a kind of Thessalian ditty, misguided mind as he had.
But Cynisca on a sudden began to weep more warmly than a maiden of six years be­ side her mother, longing for her bosom.
Then I, the hot fellow, whom you know, Thyonichus, struck her 13 with my fist on the side of the face, ay and another blow again:
and she, having drawn her robes up around her, went away out quickly.
Do not I please you, my pest?
Is another sweeter to you 14in the bosom ?
Go, caress another lover:
for him those tears of thine flow 15 like sweet apples.
And like as a swallow flies back quickly to gather victuals, 16 fresh sustenance for her young nestlings;
May, more swiftly ran she from her soft seat, right through the vestibule and folding-doors, 17 wherever her feet bore her.
In truth there is a saw spoken, 18 ‘The bull has gone to the wood.'
'Tis twenty now, and eight and nine and ten days beside ;
to-day is the eleventh, add two:
and 'tis two months since we have been parted one from the other, and, 19after the Thracian custom, I have not shavenmyself.
And to her now Lycus is 20 every thing, and to Lycus at night the door is opened.
21 But I am neither worthy any ac­ count, nor am I numbered, wretched Megarensian, being in most dishonoured plight.
And if indeed I could love no more, then every thing would go on as it ought:
but now, 22at last, as the mouse, so the saying is, Thyonichus, I have tasted pitch.
And what is the remedy for hopeless love, I know not:
only Simus, he who was enamoured of the daughter of Epichalcus, Simus, my equal in age, sailed abroad and came back heart-whole.
231 too will sail across the sea :
I shall be neither the worst, nor perhaps the foremost, but an ordinary kind of soldier.
Thyon.
Would that indeed what you desire could turn out to your mind, Æschines !
But if in sooth you are thus deter- mined to go abroad, Ptolemy is the very best of pay-masters to a free-man..,EscA.
And in other respects, what kind of man is he ?
Thyon.
The very best to a free-man;
indulgent, fond of the Muses, given to love, pleasant in the extreme.
He knows him who loves him, still better him that loves him not:
gives much to many:
not refusing, when asked;
as a king should be.
But it is not right to ask on every occasion, Æschines.
So that if you are minded to clasp the top of your mantle up­ on.
your right shoulder, and 24standing firm on both feet will have the nerve to bide the onset of the bold warrior, off with all speed to Egypt!
We all become old men, beginning from the temples, and time that maketh gray creeps on by degrees to the chin.
Those must do something, 25 whose knee is fresh and active.
This Idyll describes a festival in honour of Adonis, kept at the cost of Arsinoe, with great pomp, at Alexandria;
and it affords the poet an opportunity for lauding the queen, and through her, king Ptolemy also.
Two Syracusan women who have Alexandrian husbands, in a low rank of life, start out with their maids to the palace, to see the show.
The Idyll has three scenes, so to speak—first, the dialogue between Gorge and Praxinoe, at the house of the latter;
—then their adventures in the way to the palace ;
-and lastly, the interior of the palace, and the battle of words between these women and a stranger, which is hushed by the song of a female minstrel in honour of Adonis:
when this is ended, they return home.
The poem is true to life in its lighter and more homely parts;
and is also remarkable for the graceful introduction of praise of the royal family.
Gorgo.
Is Praxinoe within ?Praxinoe.
Dear Gorge, how late you are !
I am at home.
'Tis a wonder you have come even now.
1 See for a chair for her, Eunoe:
and put a cushion on it.
Gorg. 2
It does very well.
Praxin.
Be seated.
Gorg.
Oh !
my unbroken spirit, with difficulty have I reached you in safety, Praxinoe, the crowd being great, and the chariots many.
Every where there are 3 booted men ;
every where cavaliers ;
and the road is toilsome, and you live too far from me.
PraxiM.
For this reason that 4 madman came to the extre­ mity of the world, and took 5 a den, not an habitation, in order that we might not be neighbours to each other;
a jealous pest, ever the same for strife.
Gorg.
Don't say such things, my dear, of your goodman Deinon, in the presence of the little one.
See, ma'am, how he is looking at you !
Praxin.
Never mind, little Zoppy, sweet child !
I don't mean 6papa !
Gorg.
The infant understands you, 7by'r Lady.
Pretty papa!
PraxiM.
That papa indeed lately, (and we call every thing lately, you know,) going to buy 8 nitre and ceruse from a stall, even came and brought me mere salt, 9 the great big oaf.
Gorg.
Ay;
and my husband, Diocleidas, is just the same, 10 a ruin of money.
For seven drachmae yesterday he bought five fleeces, mere dog's-hair, mere pluckings of old wallets;
all filth :
trouble on trouble.
But come, don your 11 fine robe and your clasped kirtle.
Let us go to the palace of the king, rich Ptolemy, to be spectators of the ‘Adonis.'
I hear that the queen is getting up a charming kind of affair.
PraxiM.
In the house of a fortunate person all is flourish- ing.
What 12 you have seen, that you might tell, when you have seen it, to them that have not seen it.
Gorg.
It must be time to be off:
to the idle 'tis ever holiday.
Praxin.
Eunoe, 13 bring hither the towel, and place it in the middle again, good-for-nothing hussey:
the cats want to sleep softly.
Come, stir, bring water quickly.
I want water first.
See how she brings the towel.
Well, give it me !
Don't pour in too much water, wasteful!
wretched creature, why are you wetting my kirtle ?
That will do.
14 I am washed enough to satisfy the gods.
Where is the key of the large press ?
Bring it hither.
Gorg.
Praxinoe, that pelisse with ample folds greatly becomes you;
tell me 15 how much did it stand you in from the loom ?
PraxiM.
Don't mention it, Gorge !
more than two pounds of good silver.
But I had set even my life upon the bargain.
Gorg.
Well, it turned out to your wishes.
Praxin.
Yes, you have said well.
Bring me my cloak and my parasol.
Put it about me becomingly.
I won't take you, child.
16 Bugbear !
Horse bites !
Cry as much as you please :
but we must not have you become lame.
Let us be moving.
Phrygian slave, take and play with the little man.
Call the do,,,, in.
Shut the hall door.

Many good works have been done 18 by you, 0 Ptole­ my.
Since your sire has been among the immortals, no evil­ doer assaults the passenger, creeping up in the 19 Egyptian fashion.
Even as formerly men wholly made up of deceit used to sport, like to each other in evil tricks, 20 all worthless.
Sweetest Gorge, what is to become of us ?
Here are the war- horses of the king.
My good man, don't trample on me.
The chesnut charger has reared upright.
See, how fiery he is.
Impudent Eunoe, will you not By ?
He will make an end of his leader.
I am very much delighted, that my child remains in the house.
Gorg.
Courage, Praxinoe:
we are now in the rear of them.
And they have fallen 21 into their rank.
Praxin.
I too am collecting myself at length.
From a child I have been very much afraid of a horse, and the 22 cold snake.
Let us hasten on.
What a vast crowd is pouring upon us !
Gorg.
From court, good mother ?
Old Woman.
I am, my daughters.
Gory.
Then is it easy to pass in ?0.

Fairest of daughters, by trying, in truth, all things are accomplished.

The old woman has departed, "having delivered oracles.
Praxin. 23 Women know every thing:
even how Jove wed­ ded Juno.
Gorg.
Observe, Praxinoe, what a throng around the doors !
PraxiM. Prodigious !
Give me your hand, Gorge.
And do you, Eunoe, take the hand of Eutychis !
Keep close to her, that you may not be lost.
Let us all go in together.
Hold tight to us, Eunoe.
Oh !
wretched me !
my fine summer veil has been torn in two at last, Gorge.
By Jove, if you would be in any degree blest, good sir, keep off my robe.
Stranger.
It is not in my power indeed:
but still I will keep off.
Praxin.
The crowd is all in a heap.
They push like boars.
Strang.
Courage, madam, we are all safe.
PraxiM. 24
Next year and afterwards, dear sir, may you be prosperous, for taking care of us as you did.
What a good compassionate man!
Our Eunoe is being hustled.
Come, wretched girl, burst through.
Well done.
We are all inside, 25 as the man said, when he shut in his bride.
Gorg.
Praxinoe, come hither!
first observe the embroid­ ery ;
how fine and elegant!
26 you would say 'twas the robes of goddesses.
PraxiM.
Our lady Minerva :
what clever spinsters wrought them!
What fine artists 27 have painted these life-like pic- tures ?
How true to nature they stand, and how true they move!
They are breathing, and not inwoven.
Man is a clever kind of contrivance.
And how admirably is lie represented as reclining on a 28 silver couch, just shedding the first down from his temples, the thrice beloved Adonis, who is beloved even in Acheron.2nd Stranger.
Ye wretched women, stop prating incessant­ ly, like turtles.
They will wear us out, pronouncing all their words broadly.
Gorg.
Mother earth, where does the man come from ?
And what is it to you, if we are praters ? 29 When you have ac­ quired a right, order us !
Do you order Syracusan women ?
And that you may know this too, 30 we are Corinthians by descent, as was also Bellerophon.
We speak in the Pelopon­ nesian dialect.
And 'tis lawful, I suppose, for Dorians to speak in the Doric.Praxin. 0 Proserpine, may there never arise but one to be my master.
I do not care, 31 don't give me scant measure.
Gorg.
Hush, Praxinoe, the sister of the Argive woman, a very skilful songstress, who also excelled in the dirge of 32 Sperchis, is going to sing the Adonis.
She will sing some­ thing fine, I am very sure.
She is just now bridling up.
Singing Woman.
33 Mistress, that hast loved Golgus, and Idalium, and lofty Eryx, Aphrodite, sporting in gold, how lovely to thee, in the twelfth month, did the soft-footed Hours bring back Adonis from ever-flowing Acheron;
dear Hours, tardiest of the immortals:
yet they come objects of longing, ever 34bringing something for all mortals:
Dionæan Venus, thou indeed hast made, as the story of men runs, Berenice immortal instead of mortal, having distilled 35 ambrosia into the bosom of a woman :
and paying grateful offerings to thee, O thou of many names, of many temples, Arsinoe, the daugh­ ter of Berenice, resembling Helen, cherishes Adonis with all good things.
Beside him lie fruits in their season, whichso­ ever the topmost branches bear.
And beside him tender 36 quick-growing plants, kept in silver baskets, and golden caskets of 37 Syrian unguent, and honey-cakes, as many as wo­ men shape in a mould, mixing all kinds of flowers with the white fine-meal:
all shapes as many as are made of sweet honey, and those that are wrought in moist oil, fowls and creeping things, are present here for him.
And verdant canopies, weighed down with soft dill,,are constructed;
and the 38boy loves are fluttering about overhead, even as young nightin­ gales, perching on the trees, flit about, making trial of their wings, from bough to bough.
0 the ebony, 0 the gold, 0 ye two eagles of 39 white ivory bearing to Jove, the son of Saturn, a lad as cup-bearer.
And above are purple rugs, softer than sleep, 40 as Miletus will say, and whoso feeds flocks in the Samian land.
Another couch is strown for the beautiful Adonis.
One Venus occupies, the other rosy-armed Adonis, the bridegroom of eighteen or of nineteen years.
41 His kiss does not prick ;
still his lips are reddish all round.
Now, indeed, adieu to Venus, enjoying her own husband.
42
And at dawn we in a body, along with the dew, will carry him out to the waves foaming on the shore:
and having unbound our hair, and having loosened to the ancles the folds of our robes, with bosoms suffered to appear, will begin the clear-sweet song.
Alone of the demigods, as 'tis said, thou comest, dear Adonis, both hither and to Acheron:
neither did Agamemnon enjoy this privilege, nor the great Ajax, hero of grievous wrath, nor Hector, the most honourable of the twenty sons of Hecuba, nor Patrocles, nor Pyrrhus having returned from Troy, nor those who were yet earlier in date, the Lapithæ and 43 Deucalions, nor the descendants of Pelops, and Pelasgi, 44 eldest rulers of Argos.
Be prosperous now, dear Adonis, and mayest thou give pleasure next year;
both now thou hast come, 0 Adonis, and whenever thou mayest arrive, thou wilt come, dear.
Gorg.
Praxinoe, the affair is very clever.
The female is fortunate in having so much knowledge-most fortunate, in that she sings sweetly.
However, it is time even for home:
Diocleidas is without his dinner.
46 And the man is vinegar all over:
and, if he is hungry, don't go near him.
Farewell, beloved Adonis, and go to those who rejoice at your coming.
This poem is written in praise of Hiero, son of Hierocles, tyrant of Sy­ racuse, a ruler of great moderation, and also of warlike renown, ac­ quired in his battles with the Carthaginians.
The poet lashes the avarice of most rulers ;
who, he says, do not favour poets, and so prevent their fame from gaining that immortality, which cannot be attained, save by song.
He goes on to praise Hiero as an honourable exception;
and afterwards prays for the future safety and fortunes of Syracuse, and of Hiero, its ornament and support.
In conclusion he invokes the Graces, to win favour for his strains.
The poem was written in the time of the Punic war, after Hiero's treaty with Rome (B. c. 263),
In character it is epic and encomiastic.
THIS is ever a care to the daughters of Jove, ever to poets, t9 hymn immortals, 1 to hymn the glories of brave men.
The Muses indeed are goddesses ;
goddesses sing of gods:
but we are mortals here ;
let us mortals sing of mortals.
2
Yet who of as many as dwell under the bright dawn, will open his doors, and graciously welcome in his home our 3 Graces, and not send them away again unrewarded ?
Whilst they indig­ nantly return home with naked feet, flouting me much, because they have gone on a fruitless journey ;
and sluggishly again, having thrust their heads upon their 4 starved knees, they abide at the bottom of an empty coffer, where they have 5 a dry seat, whensoever they shall have returned after a bootless errand.
Who of the present generation of men 6 is of such a nature as this ?
Who, I mean, will love one that has spoken well of him ?
I know not!
for no longer, as of old, are men anxious to be celebrated for worthy deeds, but they have been conquered by gains.
And every one keeping his hands in his bosom, regards his 7 money, from what source it shall increase;
and would not even rub the rust off, or give it to any one;
but says immediately, 8 ‘The shin is further off than the knee:
let me have something myself.
Gods honour poets.
And who would listen to another ?
Homer is enough for all.
This is the best of poets, who will carry off nothing from me.'
Strange men !
now what gain is your countless gold laid up within ?
Such is not the advantage of wealth to the wise :
but it is rather to give a part to 9 one's tastes, and a part also to one of the poets:
and to do good to many of one's 10 kins­ men, and many too of other men, and ever to perform sacrifices to the gods;
11 and not to be a bad host, but to send away a guest having treated him kindly at one's board, whensoever he may choose to depart:
but chiefly to honour the sacred inter­ preters of the Muses, that, though buried in Hades, you may be well spoken of;
and may not lament ingloriously in chilly Acheron, like some 12 poor man, having had his hands'made callous inside by the spade, bewailing portionless poverty left him by his fathers.
13
In the mansions of Antiochus and king Aleuas, 14 many serfs had monthly provisions measured out to them:
and many calves lowed with horned heifers, as they were driven to the stalls of the Scopadæ:
and shepherds would let out to feed along the Crannonian plain, ten thousand choice sheep for the hospitable Creondæ :
15 yet had there been no pleasure to them of these things, after that they had poured out their sweet spirits into the broad bark of hateful Acheron;
and, out of mind, having quitted those many and rich resources, they would have lain long ages among the wretched dead, had not the clever bard, 16 the Ceian with his changeful song set to his many-stringed lyre, made them illustrious to posterity;
17for even swift steeds which came to them crowned from the sacred contests, obtained a share in the honour.
And who had ever known the nobles of the 18 Lycians, who the sons of Priam with the flowing locks, or Cycnus called feminine from his complexion, had not bards hymned the battle-dins of olden heroes?
Not even Ulysses, though he wandered one hundred and twenty months over all nations of men, and went alive to extremes!
Orcus, and escaped the cave of the destructive Cy­ clops, would have had lasting renown :
hushed too in silence had been the swine-herd Eumæus, and Philætius busied among the heifers of the herd, and great-hearted Laertes him­ self, had not the 19 songs of a man of Ionia befriended them.
From the Muses comes worthy renown to men ;
but 20 the living consume the wealth of the dead :
since however the toil is the same to measure waves on the shore, as many as the wind drives to land with the green ocean, 21or to wash a muddy brick with dark-coloured water, as to get round a man 22 blinded by avarice, farewell to all such:
and may they have money untold, and ever may a longing for more possess them.
Yet I would prefer 23 to many mules and horses, honour, and the friendship of men.
Now I am in quest of one, to whom among mortals I may come with favour, by the help of the Muses;
for hard are the ways to minstrels, apart from the daughters of Jove, the mighty counsellor.
Not yet hath heaven tired of drawing on months and years ;
many steeds will yet move the chariot's wheel.
Such a man will arise, as shall need me for his bard, when he has achieved as much as mighty Achilles, or strong Ajax in the plain of Simois, where is the sepulchre of Phrygian Ilus.
Already 24 now the Phce­ nicians, dwelling at the very farthest part of Libya under the setting sun, shudderwith alarm :
already Syracusans carry their lances by the middle, having their arms burdened with wicker shields:
and among them Hiero, a match for elder heroes, girds himself, and 25 his horsehair plumes overshadow his helmet.
Oh that, most glorious father Jove, and lady Minerva, and thou, 26 Proserpine, who with thy mother hast obtained by lot the great city of the exceeding-rich Ephyræans, by the waters of Lysimelia, stern necessity would send our enemies out of the island over the Sardinian wave, to announce to wives and children the fate of their dear ones, 27 by the fact of their be- ing numbered by many;
and oh!
might cities be inhabited again by former citizens, cities as many as the hands of enemies have laid waste utterly:
and ok that they might till flourishing fields;
and their 28 thousands unnumbered of sheep, fattened upon the herbage, might bleat along the plain, and heifers, coming in herds to the stalls, urge on the traveller by twilight:
and oh that the fallow lands might be broken up for sowing, what time29 the cicala, watching the shepherds in the open air, chirps within the trees on the topmost branches;
that spiders might distend fine webs in the arms, 30 and not even the name of the battle-cry be heard any longer.
And may minstrels bear lofty glory for Hiero, even beyond the Scy­ thian sea, and where 31 Semiramis having bound a broad wall with asphalt reigned within it.
I indeed am but one man:
yet the daughters of Jove love many others also, to all of whom it is a care to hymn Sicilian 32 Arethusa with her peoples, and 33the warrior Hiero.
34 Ye goddesses having your rise from Eteocles, that love Minyan Orchomenus, hated of old by Thebes, inglorious indeed may I remain at home:
yet with confidence would I go to men's halls, if they call me, along with my Muses, and I will not leave even you behind.
For apart from the Graces what is ever beloved by man ?
May I ever bide with the Graces.
The poet intending to celebrate Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, sets out with the praise of his father, Ptolemy Lagus, to whom after his death a place among the gods had been ascribed ;
and goes on to eulogize Berenice, the mother of Philadelphus, whom Venus was sup­ posed to have received into her temples to be her πάρεδρος, or assessor, He next proceeds to set forth the fortunes and virtues of Philadelphus himself, beginning with the happy omens which had attended his birth in the island of Cos, and portended his future opulence and power.
Then follows an enumeration of the royal territories, and laudation of the royal wealth, augmented as it has been by the blessings of peace.
The poet commends in glowing terms the munificence and discern­ ment of Philadelphus in conferring favours, as well as his filial piety shown so eminently.
He ends with praise of the queen, the wife and sister of Ptolemy.
Reiske, Warton, and others have held this to be a poem of Callimachus;
but Eichstadt declares that, while it equals the lightness of the poems of that writer, it surpasses them in jejuneness.
1 BEGIN we with Jove, and at Jove make an end, ye Muses, whensoever we sing in our minstrelsy the best of immortals.
But of men, on the other hand, let Ptolemy be spoken of among 2 the first, and last, and at the middle;
for he is the most excellent of men.
Heroes, who 3 aforetime sprung from demigods, having done noble deeds have met with skilful poets.
But I, knowing how to speak well, would fain hymn the praise of Ptolemy;
and hymns are a glory even of the immortals themselves.
A wood-cutter having gone to woody Ida, looks around whence to begin his work, though there is abundance at hand.
What shall I first recount ?
for in­ numerable glories occur to tell, with which the gods honoured the best of kings.
From his fathers what a man indeed was Ptolemy son of Lagus 4to accomplish a great work, when he had conceived in his mind a counsel which no other man was able to devise.
5
Him father Jupiter has made equal in honour even to the blest immortals, and for him a chamber of gold has been built in the mansion of Jove;
and beside him sits Alexander, kindly disposed to him, a god hard upon Persians with variegated turbans.
And opposite to them is set the chair of Hercules, slayer of the Centaur, wrought out of solid adamant;
where with other celestials he holds feasts, rejoicing exceedingly in his grandchildren's grandchildren, 6 because the son of Saturn has exempted their limbs from old age.
and because, being of his 7 brood, they are styled immortals.
For to both the brave son of Hercules is an ancestor, and both 8 reckon up their descent to Hercules, as the source.
Wherefore likewise when, at length satisfied with fragrant nectar, he goes from the feast to the chamber of his dear spouse, to the one he gives his bow and the quiver under his elbow, and to the other his iron club, studded with knots;
and they bear the arms to the ambrosial chamber of white-9ancled Hebe, along with their ancestor, Jove's son himself.
And among wise women how did far-famed Berenice shine, a great blessing to her parents !
Upon whose fragrant breast, indeed, the august daughter of Dione, that occupies Cyprus, impressed her slender hands.
Wherefore 'tis said that never did any woman so please her husband, as Ptolemy in fact loved his own wife.
She indeed returned his love far more than other wives.
Thus he could trustfully commit his whole house to his children's care, when­ soever lover-like he ascended to the chamber of his loving wife.
10 But of an unloving woman the thoughts are ever on a stranger ;
and her parturitions are easy, but the children never like the father.
0 Lady Aphrodite, excelling the goddesses in beauty, to thee she was a care, and on account of thee beauteous Berenice did not cross mournful Acheron ;
but having snatched her away ere she had come down to the dark stream, and to the ever-rueful ferryman of the -dead, thou placedst her in thy temple, and gavest her a share in thine honour.
And gentle to all mortals, she ever breathes upon them soft loves, and to one that longs 11 makes his cares light.
12 0 dark-browed Argive lady, thou didst bear Diomed, slayer of hosts, a Calydonian hero, when thou hadst been united to Tydeus.
But deep-bosomed Thetis bare the warrior Achilles to Peleus, son of Æacus:
and thee, 0 warrior Ptolemy, distinguished Berenice to a warrior, Ptolemy.
13 And Cos did rear thee, having received thee a new-born babe from thy mother, when thou sawest the dawn first.
For there the 14daughter of Antigone, weighed down with throes, called out for 15 Lucina, the friend of women in travail.
And she with kind favour stood by her, and in sooth poured down her whole limbs an insensibility to pain, and so a lovely boy, like to his father, was born.
said, with fond hands touching the infant:
17 ‘Blessed, boy, mayest thou be, and mayest thou honour me as much as even Phœbus Apollo honoured Delos of the azure fillet:
and in the same honour mayest thou rank the 18 promontory of Triops, assigning equal 19 favour to the Dorians dwelling near, as also king Apollo lovingly paid to 20 Rhenæ.”
Thus, I wot, spake the island, and the propitious eagle-bird of Jove thrice from on high, above the clouds, screamed with its voice.
This methinks is a sign of Jove.
To Jove the son of Saturn august monarchs are a care:
and chiefly he, whomsoever he shall have kissed at his first birth ;
and great fortune attends him.
Much land rules he, and much sea.
Numberless con­ tinents, as well as myriads of races of men, till corn-fields assisted by the moisture of Jove:
but no region produces so much as low21 lying Egypt, when Nile gushing forth breaks up the moist clods.
Nor hath any so many cities of men skilled in works.
Three hundred indeed of towns have been built for him, ay and three thousand over and above thirty thousand, and two triads, and besides them thrice nine ;
in 22 all which magnanimous Ptolemy is sovereign.
And in truth he cuts off for his portion a part of Phoenicia and Arabia, and of Syria and Libya, and the black Æthiopians ;
and he bears sway over all the Pamphylians, and warrior Cilicians, and Lycians, and war-loving Carians, and the island Cyclades, for 23 his ships are the best that sail over the sea ;
and all sea and land and rushing rivers are ruled over by Ptolemy.
And for him many horsemen and many shield-bearers arrayed in gleaming brass rage and roar.
In wealth indeed he outweighs all monarchs, so much every day comes into his splendid house from every quarter, and the peoples go about his works in peace and quietness.
For no hostile infantry having crossed the Nile abounding in 24 croco­ diles, has raised the battle-cry in strange villages;
nor has any armed man leapt ashore from a swift ship against the cattle of Egypt, as a foe:
such a hero yellow-haired Ptolemy has established himself in her broad plains, skilful to wield the spear;
whose whole care is to protect his patrimony, as a good king's should be;
and other realms he is himself ac­ quiring.
Not however to no purpose, I ween, is the gold in his wealthy house, 25 even as the riches of labouring ants are ever poured in;
but much of it indeed the splendid temples of the gods have, whilst ever and anon he offers first-fruits with other gifts:
and much has he bestowed on brave kings, and much on cities, and much on good comrades;
nor has any man, skilled to strike up a sweet song, 26come to the sacred contests of Bacchus, 27 to whom he has not presented a gift worthy of his craft.
28
And the interpreters of the Muses sing the praise of Ptolemy, in return for his beneficence.
But what can be more honourable to a man of wealth than to win worthy renown among men ?
This remains sure even to the sons of Atreus, while those countless acquisitions, as many as they made, when they had taken the mighty house of Priam, have been hidden some where in the 29mist, from which there- after there is no longer a return.
30 This man, alone of men of former ages, impresses the foot-prints of his parents, yet warm in the dust, as he treads above them.
31 To his loved mother and father he has placed incense-breathing temples, and has set them up therein conspicuous with gold and ivory, as helpers to all mortals.
And many fatted haunches of oxen does he burn, in revolving months, on blood-red altars, him­ self and his goodly spouse, than whom no nobler woman embraces her bridegroom in the palace 32 with bended arm, loving as she does from the heart her brother and husband.
Thus too was consummated 33the holy marriage of the im­ mortals, whom sovereign Rhea bare as sovereigns of Olym­ pus :
and Iris, still a virgin, having washed her hands with unguents, strews one couch for Jupiter and Juno to sleep upon.
Farewell, 0 king Ptolemy ;
but of thee I will make mention like as of other demigods ;
and methinks 34 I shall speak a word not to be spurned by posterity:
'Excellence at any rate one will gain from Jupiter.
'
After the nuptials of Helen and Menelaus, the chief maidens of Sparta, ranging themselves before the bridal chamber, sing an Epithalamium, beginning with the jokes which would naturally be passed at the ex­ pense of the bridegroom.
Menelaus is next felicitated on the score of the prize of beauty which he has won, while so many of the noblest suitors failed.
The poet passes naturally on to a description of Helen's personal and mental graces, and puts into the mouth of the chorus a warm expression of their love and regard for her.
This Idyll is of a lyric character, and is amongst the most beautiful of its kind.
Some have been led, by its dissimilarity from the other Idylls, to suppose Theocritus not to have been its author.
But there is no reason why he should not have excelled in this as in more homely styles.
He may have borrowed from Stesichorus, but the Epithalamium of that poet not being extant, we have no means of deciding whether, or how far, this was the case.
It is of that class of Epithalamia which is called κατακοιμητικὸν, or slumber-inducing.
1 WHILOME in Sparta, at the house of auburn-haired Mene­ laus, maidens having blooming 2 hyacinth in their tresses, formed the dance in front of a 3newly-painted nuptial cham­ ber, the twelve first maidens of the city, 4pride of the Spartan women, when the younger son of Atreus, having wedded Helen the beloved daughter of Tyndarus, had shut her within his chamber.
And they began to sing, I ween, all beating time to one melody with many-twinkling 5 feet, and the house was ringing round with a nuptial hymn.
"Hast thou then fallen asleep thus too early, 0 dear bridegroom ?
Art thou then of a nature over sluggish, or art thou fond of slumber ?

Or wast thou drinking a draught too much, when thou didst lay thyself on thy couch ?
If thou didst want to sleep in season, thou shouldest have done so by thyself, 7 and have suffered the damsel to sport with her maidens beside her fond mother, until morning prime;
since both the day after to-morrow, and to-morrow, and from year to year, 0 Menelaus, she i your bride.
Blest husband, some lucky person 8 sneezed or thee, as thou wentest to Sparta, (whither the rest of the nobles repaired,) that thou 9mightest accomplish thine object.
Alone among demigods thou wilt have Jupiter, son of Saturn, as father-in-law.
A daughter of Jove has gone beneath the same coverlet with thee, being such an one as no other of Greek women, that treads the earth.
Surely a great thing would she bear to thee, if she bare one like its mother.
For we are play-mates all, who had the same course to run, 10 when we had anointed ourselves, like men, beside the banks of Eurotas, four times sixty damsels, a youthful band of maidens;
of whom not one would he faultless, if haply she should have been compared with Helen.
11 As the rising morn would show out its beauteous face against the night, or as bright spring 12when winter has relaxed ;
so also the golden Helen was wont to shine out amongst us.
13 As a tall cypress hath shot up, an ornament to a fertile field or garden, or a Thes­ salian steed to a chariot, thus also the rosy-complexioned Helen is an ornament to Lacedæmon.
14 Neither does any damsel weave such work in the wool-basket, nor cut off from the long upright beams a closer warp in the curiously wrought web, having woven it with the shuttle.
15 No, nor is any damsel so skilled to strike the cithern, 16 singing of Artemis, and broad-chested Athené, as Helen, 17in whose eyes are all loves."
0 beauteous, 0 graceful damsel, thou indeed art a matron now;
but we in the morning shall proceed to the course and the flowery meads, to cull chaplets breathing sweet incense, oft remembering thee, 0 Helen, as suckling lambs yearning for the teat of their mother.
For thee first of any having plaited a chaplet of 18low-growing lotus, we will place it on the shady plane tree ;
and for thee first, taking moist oil from silver flask, we will drop it beneath the shady plane tree, and letters shall be 19 graven on the bark, that any passer-by may recite in Doric:
"Reverence me, I am Helen's tree.”
—Hail, thou bride !
Hail, bridegroom, happy in thy father-in-law.
May Latona indeed, Latona the nurse of youth, grant to you the blessing of children;
and Venus, goddess Venus, that ye may be loved alike one by other;
and Jove, Jove the son of Saturn, lasting riches ;
that they may descend from nobly-born to nobly-born again.
20 Sleep on, breathing into the bosoms each of the other love and desire, and forget 21 not to rise to­ wards morn.
We too will return at dawn, as soon as the earliest 22 songster having reared his crested neck, shall have crowed from his roost, 23 Hymen, 0 Hymenæus, mayest thou joy over these nuptials.
This little poem seems to have been wrought out of the fortieth ode of Anacreon, which has been rendered into English by our freshly lost Thomas Moore ;
to which however it is clearly inferior in the merit of originality and management of subject.
Valkenaer thinks it a poem of Bion ;
but Stobæus (c. 63) quotes the lines as the work of Theo­ critus.
Meleager (Epigr. cviii. Antholog. Jacobs) has taken the same subject for his muse.
1 THE naughty bee once stung the pilferer Eros, as he was plundering a comb from the hives, and pierced all the tips of his fingers;
and he began to lament and blow his hand;
and struck the earth, and leaped aloft.
Then showed he his pain to Aphrodite, and began to complain 'that at any rate the bee is a little creature, and yet what great wounds it inflicts!'
And his mother smiling said-How then ?
are you not a crea­ ture resembling the bees ?
Since little though you be, yet the wounds you inflict, how great are they !
The poet in this Idyll introduces a rustic complaining of the scorn and contempt of a city maiden in rejecting his addresses.
Having de­ clared the cause of this scorn, he shows how undeserving he is of it, as being neither ugly nor a man of the lowest condition, seeing that gods and goddesses had sought out of his rank of life, objects of love.
Heinsius holds this to be a poem of Moschus, but though Valkenaer inclines to the same opinion, the mass of testimony ascribes it to Theocritus.
EUNICA laughed at me when I wished sweetly to kiss her, and, teasing me, said thus:
1 'Away with you from me!
Clown as you are, do you want to kiss me, wretch ?
I have not learned to kiss bumpkins, 2 but to press city lips.
Don't you at any rate kiss my fair mouth, no, not in your dreams.
What a look you have !
what a speech !
3 how rudely you toy
How mincingly you talk!
what wheedling words you utter!
How 4 smooth is the beard you have !
what sweet hair !
5
Nay, your lips in truth are diseased, and your hands are black, and you smell foully.
Away from me, lest you contaminate me!
'
Speaking thus, 6 she spat thrice on her breast, and 7 eyed me all over from my head to my two feet, making mouths at me with her lips, and looking at me askance.
8
And she played the woman with much affectation as to her figure, and laughed at me with a mocking and proud kind of laugh.
But 9quickly my blood boiled up, and I became purple in complexion by reason of my chagrin, as a rose is with dew.
And she indeed left me and went away.
But I bear wrath at my heart, because a worthless mistress has ridiculed me, pleasing though I am.
Shepherds, tell me the truth ;
'am I not beautiful?' 10 Has one of the gods, I wonder, made me on a sudden another mortal?
11For formerly a pleasing kind of beauty was bloom­ ing upon me, as ivy on the trunk, and used to shade my chin ;
and my locks poured, like parsley, around my temples, and my white forehead was wont to shine over dark eye-brows ;
my eyes were far more 12 bright than those of blue-eyed Athené;
13 my mouth more sweet even than cream cheese ;
and 14 from my lips flowed a voice more pleasant than from a honey-comb.
And sweet is my melody, both if I warble to the shepherd's pipe, and if I sing to the flute, or the reed, or the 15 flageolet.
And all the women along the mountains say that I am handsome, and all of them love me ;
but the city miss has not kissed me, but has run past me, because I am a rustic ;
16 and she is not yet aware that beauteous Bacchus used to drive the calf in the valleys.
Neither did she know that Venus maddened after a herdsman, and tended flocks with him on the Phrygian mountains.
17 Adonis, himself, she kissed in the woods, and in the woods she lamented.
18 And who was Endymion ?
Was he not a herdsman?
Yes, and him Selene kissed, as he fed his herds;
and coming from Olympus she went up to the Latmian glade, and slept beside the lad.
19Thou too, Rhea, bewailest thy herdsman.
And hast not even thou, 0 son of Saturn, wandered 20 in the form of a bird through love of a herd-tending boy.
But Eunica alone has not kissed the herdsman, Eunica who is superior no doubt to Cybele, and Venus, and to Selene.
Love no longer even thou, 21 ‛would-be Venus,' thy sweet one either in the city or on the mountain, but sleep alone all night long.
This Idyll contains a conversation of two fishermen by night.
Our poet addressing one Diophantus with a few observations on the force of poverty in rousing men to active pursuits, describes the scene of this colloquy, which is laid in a scantily furnished sea-side but.
One of the fishermen calls upon the other to unriddle him the dream which he has dreamed.
It was this:
that he had in pursuit of his calling caught a golden fish, and thereupon determined with an oath to es­ chew the trade for the future.
Now that the golden hope and his dream have proved alike unreal, he fears lest he ought to consider his oath binding.
His comrade bids him be of good cheer, telling him that his oath is clearly no more real than his dream was.
This is the only Idyll descriptive of fishermen's life that has come down to us;
and it has been suggested, with much reason, that in it Theocritus imitated the θυννοθήρα or Αλιευς of Sophron.
1 POVERTY, 0 Diophantus, alone arouses the arts:
she is the teacher of labour;
for hard cares do not permit labouring men even to sleep.
And even if a man shall have tasted sleep 2for a little space in the night, solicitudes on a sudden present themselves and disturb him.
Two old men, 3hunters of the finny tribe, were reclining together, having strewed for themselves dry sea-weed in their wattled cabin, and resting themselves against its wall of leaves;
and near them were lying the implements of their handicraft, the wicker baskets, the rods, the hooks, and 4 the gum cistus, covered by sea-weed, fishing lines, and weels, and bow-nets of rushes, cords, and 5two oars, and an old boat on its rollers.
Beneath their heads was a scanty cloak of mat-work, garments, and felt caps.
This was to the fishermen their whole 6 stock of im­ plements, this their wealth.
And neither had an earthen pot, or a 7measure ;
all, all seemed superfluous to them;
8 poverty was a friend to their fishing trade.
And no neigh­ hour had they 9near ;
but on all sides the sea would gently float up even to 10 the narrow cabin.
Not yet was Selené's car accomplishing the mid-way of her course, when their wonted toil began to wake the fishermen, and having thrust away slumber from their eyelids, they proceeded to rouse a song in their minds.
Asph.
They were all liars, friend, as many as used to say that the summer nights shorten, when Jove draws out the days to a great length.
Already have I seen a myriad dreams, nor is it yet dawn.
Have I forgotten myself ?
What is the matter ?
11Are the nights then lagging ?
Com.
Asphalion, are you blaming the fair summer?
For it is not the season which has of its own accord over-stepped its due course, but your cares, disturbing your sleep, make the night long to you.
Asph.
Hast ever learnt, I wonder, to interpret dreams ;
for I have seen a good one.
I would not have you be with­ out a share in my vision ;
be partner of all my dreams, even as you are of my spoils.
For you will not be surpassed in understanding;
12he is the best diviner of dreams with whom understanding is the teacher.
Besides there is leisure too ;
for what can a man do as he lies on a bed of leaves close by the waves, 13and sleeps uncomfortably on prickly shrubs, 14 and the light is in the Prytaneum, not here.
15 for they say that that is ever catching spoil.
Com.
Tell me, pray, the vision of the night, and say and signify all to me your comrade.
Asph. 16
At evening, when I fell asleep over my sea-faring labours, (I was not indeed full of meat;
for dining 17at the proper time, if you recollect, we were sparing of our stomachs,) I fancied I saw myself on a rock, busy, and I was sitting and watching for fish, and throwing the sly bait hanging from the rod.
And one of the fat fellows made a bite ;
(for even in sleep every do- scents loaves, and so do I a fish;
) and it indeed clung to the hook, and the blood began to flow, and I was getting the rod bent by his movement.
So stretching out both my hands, I found a struggle about the creature, how I should catch a large fish with hooks rather small for him.
18 Then, remind­ ing him of his wound, 'will you prick me then,' said I :
'Nay, rather you shall be pierced sorely;
' and I extended my rod, while he did not escape it.
I seemed to have accomplished my labour, I drew ashore a golden fish, altogether wrapt up in the gold.
But fear possessed me, lest haply it should be a fish beloved by Neptune, or perhaps a treasure of blue-eyed Amphitrite.
Then softly I disengaged him from the hook, lest ever the hooks should retain the gold from his mouth.
19 And thefish indeed I hauled ashore with ropes, and I swore ,that never in future would I set foot upon the sea, but abide on land and reign over the gold.
This was even what awoke me:
but do you, my friend, resolve my mind henceforward, for I am alarmed at the oath which I have sworn.
Com.
Why then fear it not !
you have not sworn ;
for neither did you find, as you saw, a fish of gold.
But visions resemble falsehoods.
20 And if in reality, and not in sleep, you shall search these spots, the hope of your dreams requires a fish of flesh, lest you should die by famine, though amid dreams of gold.
This hymn to the Dioscuri is divided into two parts-the first (27—134) in praise of Pollux, the second of Castor.
After a proem (1—26) sounding their common praises, a most renowned contest between Pollux and Amycus is described.
When the Argonauts touched at the shores of the Bebrycians, Pollux and Castor, going in quest of water, find in the region, which abounds in springs, one Amycus of great bodily strength;
who gives out to them that they shall then only draw water, when they ':
an conquer him in boxing.
Terms are accepted, the Argonauts and Bebrycians convened, and in the conflict Pollux comes off victorious, although there was reason to fear that his adversary's vast strength might overwhelm him.
In the remainder of the Hymn is commemorated Castor's fight with Lynceus.
The cir­ cumstances of which were these.
When the Dioscuri had carried off the daughters of Leucippus, Idas and Lynceus, the sons of Aphareus, their betrothed lovers, overtake the ravishers at the tomb of Aphareus.
Then Lynceus having in vain tried to persuade the Dioscuri to give back the maidens, challenges Castor to single combat.
Castor accepts the challenge, and they fight first with spears, and then with swords, till Lynceus is wounded, and pierced through at his father's tomb, to which he had fled.
Idas, grieved at the loss of his brother, seizes a fragment of the tomb to hurl at Castor, but is himself overthrown in the act by a thunderbolt from Jupiter.
1WE celebrate the two sons of Leda and Ægis-bearing Jove, 2 Castor and Pollux, formidable to contend in boxing, when he has bound his knuckles over with thongs of ox-hide.
We celebrate both twice, and the third time, the male offspring of the 3daughter of Thestius, twin Lacedæmonian brothers, 4 preservers of men when already at the utmost extremity, and of horses thrown into confusion in the bloody rout, and of ships 5 which, running counter to setting and rising stars of heaven, have chanced upon rough gales.
For these having raised a huge wave at the stern of them, or even at the prow, or wheresoever each may choose, are wont to dash it into the hold, and then break up both the sides of the ship, whilst all the tackle hangs with the sail, broken off hap-hazard ;
and there 6 is a vast rain from the sky, as night steals on, and the broad sea murmurs, 7 struck by the blasts, and by the inces­ sant hail.
8
Yet, notwithstanding, ye, on your part, draw out even from the depths ships with sailors and all, just as they think they are going to perish.
Then quickly cease the winds and there is a clear calm over the sea, and the clouds flee away in different directions ;
and the Bears shine out again, and in the midst of the 9‘asses’ a dusky crib, indicating 10that all the weather for sailing is clear and fine.
Oh !
both of you, helpers to mortals, oh both of you, friends, as horsemen, harpers, wrestlers, minstrels-Shall I begin to sing of Castor;
or Pollux first ?
Celebrating both, I will sing of Pollux first.
Now the ship Argo, I ween, having cleared 11 the rocks that meet in one, and the mischievous mouth of snowy Pontus, arrived at the country of the Bebrycians, carrying the dear children of the gods ;
here upon many heroes were descending by one ladder from both the sides of Jason's ship.
And having landed on the low beach and 12 sheltered shore they were strewing couches, and 13 rubbing sticks to and fro in their hands.
But Castor, manager of steeds, and the dark complex­ ioned Pollux, were both keeping aloof, having strayed from their comrades.
f
And spying on a mountain14 a wild wood of vast size, they found under a smooth cliff an ever-flowing spring, filled with pure water, and the pebbles beneath seemed like crystal or silver, from the depths;
and near the spot there had grown tall pines, and poplars, and plane trees, and cy­ presses with leafy tops, 15 and fragrant flowers, pleasant work for hairy bees, flowers as many as, when spring is ending, sprout up along the meadows.
And here a man of overwhelming size would sit and take the air, terrible to look upon, 16having his cars bruised with hard thumps, 17 and his huge chest and broad back were arched and rounded with iron flesh, like a forged colossus.
And on his strong arms the muscles stood out at the surface of the shoulder, like 18round stones which the river torrent has polished by rolling in its vast eddies;
19but over his back and neck was hung a lion's skin, fastened on by the paws.
And him the prize man Pollux first bespoke.
Poll.
Save you, stranger, whoever you are.
Who are the mortals to whom this country belongs ?
Amyc.
How can I be 20 safe, that is, when, I see men, whom I have never seen ?
Poll.
Be of good cheer!
deem that you see neither unjust men, nor unjust men's SOUSeAmyc.
I am of good cheer!
And not from you is it meet that I should be taught this.
Poll.
You are savage, in every thing malignant and over­ bearing.
Amyc.
I am such as you see me:
yes, and I am not setting foot on your country.
Poll.
Come-and return home again, ay, having met with hospitable treatment.
Amyc.
Do not either you entertain me, and my entertain­ ment is not in readiness.
Poll.
My good sir, would not you at any rate allow us even to drink of this water?
Amyc.
You shall learn, when thirst 21 shall dry your re­ laxed lips.
Poll.
Is it silver, or what is the pay, will you tell us, by which we might persuade you ?
Amyc.
22Lift your hands against me in single combat;
having stood man against man.
Poll.
As a boxer, or even tripping up the heels, and keep­ ing eyes right ?
Amyc.
Having laboured might and main in boxing, spare not your craft.
Poll. 23
Why, who is there with whom I shall match my hands and cæstus ?
Amyc.
He is near.
Don't you see me ?
The boxer shall be called Amycus.
Poll.
Is the prize also ready for which we shall both con­ tend ?
Amyc.
I will be called thine, or thou shalt be called mine, if I shall have conquered.
Poll. 24 Such as these are the cock-fights of crimson-crested birds.
Amyc.
Whether then we be like birds or lions, at all events we will fight for no other prize.
So spake Amycus, and 25having taken a spiral shell, raised a sound from it.
And they quickly gathered together to the shade of the plane trees, at the blast of the trumpet, the always long-haired Bebrycians.
In like manner too Castor, pre- eminent in fight, went and summoned from the Magnesian ship all the heroes.
Now they, when, in fact, they had forti­ fied their hands with coils of ox-hide, and had rolled great thongs 26 around their arms, proceeded to engage in the midst, breathing slaughter one against the other.
Hereupon a great struggle arose to them, as they were urgent which of the two should get the glare of the sun at his back.
But by skill you over-reached a great hero, 0 Pollux, and all the countenance of Amycus was being struck with the rays.
Then he, in sooth, enraged at heart, was advancing forward, taking aim with his hands ;
when the son of Tyndarus hit the tip of his chin as he came on, and he was roused more than before, and dealt his blows 27 at random, and kept rushing on with great force, bending over towards the earth.
And the Bebrycians began to shout;
but on the other side the heroes were cheering on strong Pollux, though fearful lest haply in a narrow spot 28 a tHan resembling Tityus should bear down and subdue him.
But in truth the son of Jove on his part coming up with him in one place and another kept wounding him with both hands in turn, and was checking from his onslaught the son of Nep­ tune, overbearing though he was.
And he 29 stood reeling with blows, and spat out gory blood :
and then all the chiefs raised a shout together, when they saw grievous wounds about his mouth and jaws, and his eyes were straitened for room on his swollen visage.
30 Him, indeed, the prince (Pollux) disturbed, by making feints with his fists on every side;
but when at length he perceived that he was distressed, he drove his fist above the middle of his nose right down his brow, and stripped off all his forehead to the bone.
31 But he, having been stricken, measured his length on his back, among the green foliage.
32 Hereupon, a fierce fight arose again, when he had righted himself, and they were hurting one another by blows with the hard cæstus.
But the ruler of the Bebrycians for his part was directing his fists against the chest, and outside the neck of his foe, while Pollux the invincible was disfiguring all the others visage with unseemly blows.
And his flesh (i. e. that of Amycus) was sinking through sweat, and from being huge he had become on a sudden a little man;
but the other, as he tasted toil, was bearing limbs ever stronger, and still im­ proving in healthy colour.
Now how at last the son of Jove overthrew 33 the athlete, declare, thou goddess!
for thou knowest;
and I, the inter­ preter of others, will speak as much as thou desirest, and as is agreeable to thyself.
In truth, Amycus for his part being desirous to do some great deed, seized with his left hand the left hand of Pollux, bending slantwise with a lunge ;
and with the other hand making his assault, raised 34 his broad fist from his right side, and he would have hit and injured the king of the Amyclæans, but he in turn came up secretly from under with his head, and then with his strong hand struck him under the left temple, and fell on his shoulder ;
then the dark blood poured out rapidly from his gaping temple:
35 and with his left hand he struck his mouth, and the thickset teeth rattled;
whilst he kept maiming his face with ever sharper blows, until he had smashed his cheeks ;
but then all on the 36ground he fell senseless, 37 and lifted up both hands at once, as renouncing the victory, for he was nigh unto death.
To him then, though thou wast victor, 0 boxer Pollux, thou didst nothing madly violent;
and he sware to thee a great oath, calling his sire Neptune from the deep to witness, that never more would he be vexatious to strangers.
And thou indeed, 0 king, hast been celebrated by me.
But I will sing of thee too, Castor, son of Tyndarus, swift on horseback, brandisher of the lance, clad in brazen mail.
The two sons of Jupiter indeed had caught up, and were carrying off, two daughters of Leucippus:
ay, and in sooth these two, 38 two brethren, sons of Aphareus, wooers about to marry, Lynceus and the stout Idas, were pursuing at full speed.
But when they reached the tomb of the deceased Aphareus, from their chariots all at once rushed, one against the other, burdened with spears and hollow shields.
Then spake Lynceus to them 'from out his helmet, shouting loudly.
'Fair sirs, why long ye for battle?
And how is it ye are wrongful in the case of the betrothed of others ;
and 39 why are naked swords in your hands ?
To us, look you, Leucippus promised these his daughters long before any ;
to us this marriage stands upon oath.
But ye, in no seemly manner, in the case of the brides of others, 40 by oxen, and mules, and by goods not your own, have perverted the man ;
and by gifts have stolen our affianced brides.
In very truth I myself have often said the following words before the face of both of you, even though I am not a man of many speeches :
-Not so, kind sirs, is it fitting that princes should woo spouses, for whom bridegrooms are already provided.
41 Wide, look you, is Sparta, and wide equestrian Elis, and Arcadia rich in flocks, and the cities of the Achæans, Messene and Argos, and all the Sisy­ phian coast-land, where myriads of damsels are nurtured under the care of their parents, lacking neither figure nor mind.
'Tis easy for you to wed of these whichsoever you may choose, since many would wish in sooth to be fathers-in- law to the noble;
and ye are distinguished among all heroes, and so are your fathers, and your mother's race at the same time by descent.
Nay, friends, suffer this marriage to be con­ summated for us, and for you two let us all look out another bridal.
—Many such words I was wont to say, but a blast of wind would bear them away to the moist wave, and favour did not follow my speeches.
42 For ye two were inexorable and harsh.
But yet even now be persuaded, for ye both 43 are kinsmen to us on the fathers side.
But if your heart yearns for war, and it must needs be that, 44 having made mutual strife break forth, we end our feuds with bloodshed, Idas, indeed, and his cousin, brave Pollux, shall hold off their hands, having kept from the battle ;
but let us two, I and Castor, being the younger, decide the issue in fight, and let us not leave to our parents exceeding grief.
One corpse is enough from one house, but the others shall feast all their friends as bridegrooms instead of corpses, and shall wed these maidens ;
'tis meet, look you, to remove great strife by a little evil.
'
He spake, and his words in truth the god was not about to render idle.
For they two, indeed, who were elder in age, put off their arms from their shoulders upon the ground;
whilst Lynceus, advanced to the mid space, brandishing his strong lance under the topmost 45 rim of his shield ;
and in like manner brave Castor brandished his pointed spear, and the i plumes of the crests of both kept nodding.
First of all, indeed, with lances 46 they were busied in aiming at each other, if haply they saw any part of the body exposed.
But, in truth, the points of their spears, ere they had wounded one or the other, were broken, having stuck fast in their 47 mighty shields.
Then they two, having drawn their hangers from the scabbards, again proceeded to deal out slaughter one against the other, and there was no withdrawal of battle.
Oft, indeed, Castor pierced into the broad shield and 48 horse-plumed helmet, and oft the 49keen-eyed Lynceus struck the other's shield, and the point reached 50as far as the purple crest.
Now of this man's hand, as he brought his sharp sword in the direction of his (Castor's) left knee, Castor lopped off the extremity, having removed from under the blow with his left foot;
and he, having been wounded, cast away his sword, and speedily set off to fly to the tomb of his father, where brave Idas was re­ clining, and beholding the battle of men akin to each other.
But the son of Tyndarus having rushed after him, thrust his broad blade right through his flank and navel, and the steel quickly scattered in different ways his intestines within, and Lynceus lay bowed to the earth, and down his eye-lids, I ween, a heavy slumber coursed.
51
No, nor did Laocoosa see even the other of her sons con­ summate a marriage dear to him at his father's hearth ;
for of a truth he on his part, Messenian Idas I mean, having broken off a column standing out from the sepulchre of Aphareus, was in act to throw it speedily at his brother's murderer ;
52 but Jupiter bore aid, and dashed out of his hands the wrought marble, and burnt him up with his blaze of light­ ning.
Thus to fight with the sons of Tyndarus 53 is no light matter.
Both they themselves are mighty, and were born of one who is mighty.
Hail, children of Leda !
and may ye ever send worthy fame to my hymns, for friendly, I wot, are all poets to the Tyn­ daridæ, and Helen, and to other heroes, who sacked Troy, in aid of Menelaus.
For you, ye princes, the Chian bard wrought glory, when he had sung the city of Priam, and the ships of the Greeks, and the Ilian battles, and Achilles, 54 tower of war.
And to you, in my turn also, I bear pro­ pitiatory offerings of sweet Muses, such as they themselves provide, and according as my means are ;
and to the gods the 55noblest of honours is song.
This Idyll represents the ungovernable love of a young man for a friend, who despised him, in consequence of which he at last hangs himself.
The other, nowise moved, goes to the baths, and is there slain by a statue of Eros which falls upon and crushes him.
Virgil has taken the idea of his second Eclogue partly from this.
Compare also Ovid Met. xiv. 698.1 A CERTAIN love-sick man was enamoured of a hard youth, in beauty fair, but in disposition no longer on a par.
He hated him that loved him, and had not even a jot of mildness, and he knew not Eros, what god he was, and 2 what sort of bow and arrows he holds in his hands, how grievous shafts he hurls against boys;
but in all respects, whether in speeches or in approaches, he was unbending.
Nor was there any solace of the fires of love, not quivering of lip, nor bright flash of eyes, 3 nor rosy cheek, nor word, nor kiss that relieves love.
4
But as a beast of the forest watches the hunters, so would he do all things against the man :
and fierce were his lips, and sternly looked his eyes;
5they had fate upon them:
and his countenance answered to his bile, and the colour fled from it, 6 clad in arrogance from his wrath.
But even under these circumstances he was beautiful, 7and from his wrath the lover was the more inflamed.
8
At last he could not endure so great a blaze of Cytherea, but went and 9 began to bewail at the cruel dwelling, and kissed the door-post, and thus lifted up his voice:
-Cruel and morose youth, offspring of an evil lioness, 10 flinty youth, and unworthy of love, I have come bringing thee this last present, my rope;
since no longer do I wish to pain thee, lad, angered as thou art, but I am going whither thou hast de­ voted me ;
where, 'tis said, the road is common, and 11 where oblivion is the remedy, for them that love.
12But even though I should have taken it all to my lips, and have drained the cup, not even thus shall I quench my yearning thirst.
But now I add farewell to your vestibule—I know what is coming.
13
Both the rose is lovely, and time withers it.
And the violet is beautiful in spring, yet quickly it grows old.
White is the lily;
when it falls, it withers:
the snow too is white, and it melts after it has become frozen.
And the beauty of childhood is fair, yet it lives but a short space.
That time shall come when even you will love ;
when, scorched at your heart, you shall weep briny tears.
Nay, do you, boy, even now for this last time, do a pleasant act, 14whensoever, having gone forth, you shall have beheld me suspended at your vestibule, pass me not by, wretch as I am, but stand and weep though briefly;
and having shed the liba­ tion of a tear, loose me from the rope, and place about me gar­ ments from your limbs, and cover me, and for the last time 15 kiss me, and make the dead man a present of your lips.
Be not afraid of me.
I cannot live, no, not if, having been recon­ ciled, you shall kiss me.
And hollow me out a tomb, 16 which shall bury my love.
And if you depart, 17 shout this over me thrice:
'0 friend, thou liest low.'
Yes, and if you will, say this too:
'And for me a beautiful companion has perished.'
And write this inscription, which I will engrave for 18you in verses:
‘ Traveller, this man Love slew;
pass not by, but stop and say this, He had a cruel comrade.
'
Thus having said, he took up a stone, and having planted it against a wall even to the middle of the door-posts, a dread­ ful stone, he proceeded 19to attach to them the slender rope, and began to throw the noose around his neck;
and then he rolled the stepping-stone from under his foot, and hung, a corpse.
But the other in his turn opened the doors, and beheld the dead man suspended from his own hall-door ;
nor was he overcome in his spirit, nor did he weep 20for the slaughter of a young man :
but yet more, he polluted for the dead man all the youthful garments, and proceeded to go to the contests of the wrestlers, and to seek, afar off, pleasant baths ;
and he came to the god whom he had insulted, for Eros was standing on a stone basement above the waters.
21 And the statue leaped forth and slew the wretched youth, and the water became purpled, but the voice of the lad kept coming to the top.
Rejoice, ye that love, for he who hated has been slain ;
and ye, beloved youths, be affectionate, for the god knows how to punish.
In this Idyll the first achievement of the boy Hercules is recounted, his victory, to wit, over the hostile dragons sent against him by Juno.
Alcmena, terrified by this prodigy, (62,) sends for Teiresias, the seer, to explain it, and to point out means of appeasing the wrath of the gods.
He comes, and unfolds the labours, the earthly and the hea­ venly glory which should attend the child, when grown to man's estate.
He also orders the dragons to be burned, and the house to be purified.
There follows an enumeration of the masters, whose train­ ing conduced to make Hercules a worthy hero.
The end of the poem, which we may suppose to have gone deeply into the history of his training, has been lost..
Valkenaer thinks that this Idyll, and the 25th, and the Megara of Moschus, are the three parts of one poem, the Heraclea of some nameless author.
Reiske supposed Idylls 24th and 25th to be parts of the Heraclea of Pisander;
but Kiessling points out that the non-preservation of the customs of the heroic age in these two Idylls disproves this theory.
We may safely, with War­ ton, reckon it among the Idylls of Theocritus.ONCE upon a time Alcmena of 1 Midea, having washed both Hercules, now ten months old, and Iphiclus, younger by a night, and having filled them with milk, had laid them down in a 2brazen shield, which, a noble piece of armour, Amphi­ tryon had taken as spoil from fallen Pterelaus.
And the woman, touching the head of her children, spake thus:
'Sleep, my babes, a sweet sleep, and one from which ye may awake;
sleep, my lives, two brothers, secure children, happily may ye sleep, and happily arrive at morn.'
Thus having said, she rocked the great shield, and sleep took possession of them.
But what time 3 the Bear revolves at midnight toward the setting, opposite Orion himself, and he displays his broad shoulder, then in sooth Juno of many schemes set in motion two dreadful monsters, dragons bristling with azure coils, against the broad threshold, where the door-posts of the cham­ ber are hollow, having urged them by threats to devour the babe Hercules.
These twain then having uncoiled themselves, were rolling their ravenous bellies along the ground;
and 4from their eyes, as they went, evil fire was glancing, and they were spit- ting forth noxious venom.
5But when at length, licking their forked tongues, they had come nigh the boys, then, I wot, as Jove knoweth all things, the dear children of Alc­ mena awoke, and a light was raised all over the chamber.
In truth, the one, namely Iphiclus, forthwith shouted out, when he perceived the evil monsters above the hollow shield, and saw their ruthless fangs ;
and kicked away with his feet the fine coverlet, being eager to escape:
but the other, Hercules, opposing them, held fast to them with his hands, and bound both in a firm grasp, having seized them by the throat, where baneful poisons, such as even the gods abhor, are wrought by murderous serpents.
6
And they two, on the other hand, began to wind with their coils around the child, late-born, still a suckling, ever tearless under his nurse's care:
but again they began to uncoil, since they were wearied in their spines, in trying to find a riddance from his constraining grasp.
And Alcmena heard a cry, and awoke first.
'Rise, Amphitryon, for timid fear possesses me :
rise, 7 nor put your sandals on your feet.
Hear you not how greatly the younger of the children is crying?
8Or perceive you not that, some where in the early night, these walls also around are all plain to be seen, without the aid of clear dawn ?
There is some strange thing, I know, in the house, there is, dear husband.
'
Thus said she:
and he, having complied with his wife's request, descended from his couch, and rushed in quest of his curiously-wrought sword, which was 9 always suspended for him upon a peg, above his cedar couch.
In truth he was reaching after his new-spun belt, lifting in the other hand a large scabbard, a work wrought of the lotus;
when, I wot, the spacious chamber was filled again with gloom.
Then at length he shouted to the servants 10 snoring heavily in sleep :
'Bring fire with all speed, having snatched it from the hearth, my servants, and force back the strong bolts of the doors:
rise, ye patient-hearted servants, 11 the master calls.'
12 The servants then speedily came forward with blazing lights, and the chamber was filled with the bustling of each.
In good truth, I ween, when they saw the suckling Hercules tightly holding two monsters in his tender hands, they.
shouted out, clapping their hands together:
but he began to point out the serpents to his sire Amphitryon, and to leap aloft with joy in his boyishness, and laughingly he laid before his father's feet the dire monsters stupified with death.
Alcmena indeed then took to her bosom, dry by reason of fear, Iphiclus in passion­ ate distress ;
and Amphitryon placed the 13 other boy under his coverlet of wool, and again returned to his couch and was mindful of slumber.
The cocks a third time now were pro­ claiming the last of dawn:
then 14 Alcmena having summoned Teiresias the soothsayer, telling all things true, recounted to him the strange matter, and bade him answer how it was likely to end.
'And do not,' said sce, 15‘ if the gods intend any thing adverse, hide it from me through scruples:
for that 'tis impossible for men to escape whatever the Fate 16 forces down the spindle, I teach thee, prophet son of Eueris, very wise though thou art!'
Thus spake the queen.
And he answered thus:
‘ Cheer up, lady, mother of noblest progeny, 17 of the blood of Perseus ;
18 for, by my dear light, long since gone from mine eyes, many Achaian women shall ply the soft yarn with the hand about the knee, 19at even-tide singing of Alcmena by name :
20 thou shalt be a glory to the women of Argos.
This thy son, being such a hero, is about to ascend to the star-bearing heaven, 21 a hero with a broad chest, to whom both all monsters and all other men shall be inferior.
To him it is fated, after he has accomplished twelve labours, to dwell in the halls of Jove:
but all his mortal parts 22 the Trachinian pyre shall have.
And he shall be called son-in- law of the very immortals, who set on these skulking monsters to destroy the babe.
23 In truth, that day shall come, when the sharp-toothed wolf, having seen the kid in his lair, shall not be willing to harm it.
But, lady, let the fire be in readi­ ness, look you, under the ashes, and make ye ready dry logs of 24 aspalathus, or paliurus;
or of bramble ;
or the brittle wild-pear wood shaken by the wind:
and at midnight, when they wished to destroy thy child, burn these two dragons upon the wild cleft-wood.
25 Then at morn let one of the attendants, having gathered the ashes of the fire, carry and throw it thoroughly every whit across the river, upon the rugged rocks, over the boundary, and return home without turning back:
but first of all 26 purify the house with clear sulphur, and next remember to sprinkle with a green branch 27 plenty of pure water, mixed, as is usual, with salt;
and to sacrifice to supreme Jove a boar pig, that ye may ever be superior to your enemies.
'
Teiresias spake, and withdrew with his ivory seat, though he was bent with the weight of many years.
And Hercules was reared under his mother's care, like a 28 young plant in a garden, being called the son of Argive Amphitryon.
Letters 29 aged Linus, son of Apollo, a sleepless guardian, a hero, taught the boy :
and to bend the bow, and to be a good shot with arrows, 30 Eurytus, rich in broad lands from his forefathers.
31 Eumolpus, son of Philammon, made him a minstrel, and moulded both his hands upon a cithern of box- wood.
And in how many ways men of Argos, throwing their adversaries from their legs with a cross-buttock, trip up each other in wrestling, and in how many ways boxers are formi­ dable in the cæstus, and what tricks adapted to their art men ready for every kind of contest have invented, by falling for­ ward to the earth, all these he learned under the teaching of 32 Harpalycus of Phanote, son of Mercury, whom not though beholding him afar off, could any one withstand, as he con­ tended in the games.
Such a scowl rested on his awe-in­ spiring visage.
Moreover, with feelings of love, Amphitryon himself was wont to teach his son to drive steeds in the chariot, and turning safely 33 round the post, to guard the box of the nave of the wheel, since full oft in equestrian Argos he had carried off prizes in contests of speed ;
and his chariots on which he used to mount, 34 still unbroken, burst their reins by reason of age.
But to aim at his man with outstretched spear, keeping his back under cover of his shield, and to bear up against sword-wounds, and to marshal a pha­ lanx, and in making his attack to measure again and again the ambuscades of the enemy, and to cheer on the cavalry, Castor the horseman taught him, having come an exile from Argos, what time 35 Tydeus was holding the whole inheritance and broad vineyard, having received equestrian Argos from Adrastus.
Among the demigods was no other warrior like to Castor, before old age wore out his youthful vigour.
Thus indeed his loving mother 36 had Hercules brought up.
And a couch was made for the lad near his father, 37 a lion's skin, a couch very agreeable to himself:
and 38 his dinner was roast-meat and a huge Dorian loaf in a bread basket;
it would be safe to satisfy a digger and delver.
But 39 at the close of day he was wont to take a little supper, uncooked;
and he was clad in unembroidered garments 40 above the calf of the leg.
In this fragmentary poem we find Hercules in the land of Elis, in the neighbourhood of the famous stables of Augeas.
Having arrived thither, he is led to the king by an old rustic.
The king has retired into the country to visit his herds.
A description of a vast herd re­ turning from pasture is finely interwoven, (84—137,) and Hercules is exhibited repelling with ease the assault of the finest bull of the herd, a proof of valour which excites the admiration of the king and his son.
This son of Augeas, as they travel by the same road, begs Her­ cules to recount to him, by what means he slew the Nemean lion.
The hero, complying, narrates the whole exploit.
Some have doubted whether Theocritus wrote this poem.
It is variously assigned by such, to Pisander, a contemporary of Tyrtæus, to some unknown poet earlier than the date of Theocritus, and to some Alexandrine Rhapso­ dist.
Hermann deems it not unworthy of Theocritus.
Old editions have prefixed to this Idyll a poor attempt of some nameless gram­ marian to furnish a beginning.
And to him spake the old man, a husbandman 1in charge of the tillage, having ceased from the work which lay on his hands :
‘
Stranger, I will readily tell over to you all that you ask, since I stand in awe of the dread vengeance of 2 Hermes by the wayside.
For they say, that, most of all the gods of heaven, he is incensed, if so be that any one spurn a traveller very anxious to know the way.
The fleecy flocks indeed of king Augeas 3feed not all on one pasture, or one spot;
but some, I ween, pasture round about on the banks of 4 Elisus, others beside the sacred stream of divine 5 Alpheus, others again hard by 6Buprasium teeming with grapes, and others also here.
Now separately, for each of these, folds have been built.
But for all the herds, overflowing though they are, still there are here pastures ever rich, along the wide standing- waters of 7 Menius ;
8 for dewy meads and water-pastures luxuriate in fragant herbage in abundance, which in sooth increases the strength of horned heifers.
And here, to your right hand, appears their stall, all of it quite on the other side of the flowing river, in that quarter where the planes grow all the year long, and the green- wild olive, a sacred holy-grove of 9 pastoral Apollo, a most perfect god, stranger.
And right forwards are built very spacious dwellings for us husbandmen, who zealously guard for the king his great and untold wealth, sometimes casting 10the seed into thrice-plough­ ed fallows, and in like manner into four times ploughed.
Now his boundaries the diggers and delvers know, who, hard- workingfellows, come to the wine vats, when the ripe summer season shall have arrived.
For in truth all this is the plain of prudent Augeas, and these his wheat-bearing " acres and wooded orchards, even to the extreme points of the moun­ tain ridge having-many-springs, which we ply with our labour all day long, as is the law for servants, whose life is a-field.
But tell you also me, [which likewise will be better for yourself,] 12 being in need of what have you come here ?
Either, I suppose, you seek Augeas, or one of his servants, whom he has.
Now I, look you, can fully tell you every par­ ticular, as I know them accurately ;
for I think that you at any rate come not of evil people, nor are yourself like unto evil men, such a noble figure is conspicuous about you :
surely, methinks, of such a stamp are the sons of immortals among mortal men.'
And him the valorous son of Jove addressed in answer:
‘Yes, old man, I would wish to see Augeas, ruler of the Epeans, for it was even a want of this which brought me here.
But if now he is abiding in the city among his citizens, engaged in caring for his people, and is deciding questions of law, prythee, aged sir, bid you one of the servants to be my guide, whosoever is the most honour­ able 13 manager over these lands, to whom I might say some­ what, and from whom I might learn somewhat, when he speaks.
For God, in sooth, hath made one man in need of one, and / another of another.
'And him the old man, trusty husbandman as he was, an­ swered yet again :
‘
By the advice, stranger, of some one of the gods you come hither.
Since to you every business, which you wish, quickly finds its accomplishment.
For hither bath come but 14 yesterday from town Augeas, dear son of the Sun, with his child, the strong and noble Phyleus, to visit after many days the property, which he has in countless extent in the country.
Thus, I suppose, even to princes their house seems to be safer, to their mind, if they manage it themselves.
But let us go to him by all means ;
and I will be your guide to my stall, where we shall find the king.
'Thus having spoken, he began to lead the way ;
but 15 in mind he at least was pondering much, as he saw the lion's skin, and the club, which filled his hand, whence the stranger could be :
and he was eager to question him.
But again through fear he was keeping within his lips his speech as it rose, lest he should address to him, in his haste, any inoppor­ tune word :
for 'tis hard to know another man's mind.
And as they approached, 16the dogs quickly noticed them from afar off, in both ways, by their scent of flesh, and by the sound of feet.
And barking furiously they rushed from different sides on Hercules, son of Amphitryon :
but about the old man, barking without need or cause, they kept fawning on the other side.
These indeed he for his part proceeded to frighten into retreating, by stones, merely lifting them from the ground;
and sharply with his voice did he threaten every one of them and check their barking, though he rejoiced in his heart that they protected his stall, yes, when he was absent;
then spake he such words as these :
‘Strange !
what an animal this is, that the gods our rulers have made to be with men :
how sagacious !
if it had but a mind, so far intelligent, within, as to know with whom 'twere right to be angry, and with whom not, then no other of brutes had vied with it for the meed of honour.
But, as it is, 'tis a very wrathful kind of beast, and 17 savage to no purpose.
'
He spoke ;
and speedily they came in their progress to the stall.
The 18 Sun indeed at that time had turned his steeds towards the west, bringing on eventide:
and the fat sheep arrived, coming up from pasture to their 19 folds and pens.
Next full myriads of heifers were seen, one after another, com­ ing, like rainy clouds, as many as in the heaven are being driven forward, either by force of the south wind, or of Thracian Boreas:
of which there is no numbering, as they move in air, no, nor cessation ;
for so many does the violence of the wind roll after the first, and the rest too rise and swell upon others again :
so many herds of heifers, Isay, were coming up ever and anon behind.
Then in sooth all the plain was filled, and all the ways, with the cattle coming in, while the fertile fields were full of lowings, and the stalls easily crowded with trailing-footed oxen ;
the sheep too were fold­ ing themselves in the pens.
20 Here, indeed, no man, though they were numberless, stood inactive by the oxen, in lack of work :
but one was fitting with well-cut thongs wooden logs about the cows' feet, for the purpose of standing close beside to milk them.
Another, again, was putting the dear calves to their own mothers, all eager as they were to drink of the pleasant milk :
another was holding a milk-pail;
another was 21 thickening a rich cheese ;
another was driving in the bulls, apart from the cows.
And Augeas was going over all the ox- stalls, and noting what fruits of his possessions his herdsmen were making for him.
And with him his son as well as mighty and wise Hercules were following, as the king went round his large property.
Hereupon the son of Amphitryon, though hav­ ing in his bosom a spirit unbroken 22 and sternly fixed for ever, yet was vastly astonished on seeing the countless tribe of oxen, I ween.
For no one would say, or 23 have supposed, that the stock of one man, no, nor of ten others, ay, such as were rich in flocks beyond all other men, was so great.
Since Phoebus had presented to his son this special gift, to be rich in cattle above all men;
yes, and he kept altogether prospering for him all his beasts to the uttermost;
24 for no disease, of those which destroy the labours of herdsmen, assailed his herds.
But ever more in number, ever finer sprang up horned heifers duly from year to year:
for of a truth all were 25mothers of live offspring, far beyond others, and all of fe­ male offspring.
And together with these, three hundred bulls were ranged in rows, white-legged and crumple-horned ;
nay, there were other two hundred red;
and all such as were even already full-grown.
And other twelve again beside these were feeding, 26 sacred to the Sun, and in colour they were like swans, so white were they, and they were conspicu­ ous among all the trailing-footed oxen, which also were feeding on the verdant herbage apart from the herd in the pasture ;
so exceedingly were they exulting over themselves.
And whensoever swift wild beasts chanced to sally forth from the bushy thicket into the plain, for the sake of heifers afield, these were they, I wot, that would rush first to the con­ flict, guided by their scent of the skin ;
and bellow fearfully, 27looking slaughter in their visages.
And chief of them in­ deed both in strength, and in his natural force and high courage, was huge Phaethon :
whom in sooth herdsmen were all 28 wont to liken to a star, because as he moved he shone out greatly among other oxen, and was very conspicuous.
Now he in fact, when he beheld the dry hide of a fierce-eyed lion, upon this rushed against wary Hercules himself, so as to bring against his sides his head and sturdy forehead.
But, as he approached, 29the hero quickly seized his left horn with his broad hand, bent his neck, so hard though it was, down to the earth beneath ;
and then thrust him back again, having pressed heavily with his shoulder ;
so the bull, having the tendons of the muscles strained, stood right up on his haunches.
Then marvelled both the king himself, and Phyleus, his war­ like son, and the herdsmen over 31 crumple-horned kine, as they beheld the immense strength of the son of Amphitryon.
Then they two, Phyleus and strong Hercules, began to pro­ ceed to the city, having left there behind them the fruitful fields.
But as soon as they had set 32 foot on the highway, having got over 33 with active feet a narrow path which in sooth extended through the vineyard from the ox-stalls, not being in any way very distinguishable amid green foliage, here then, I say, the dear son of Augeas addressed the offspring of highest Jove, as he came on behind him, having slightly bent his head over his right shoulder :
34 ‘Stranger, I am just now pondering in my mind, that I have certainly heard long ago some famous story about thee.
For there came hither on his way from Argos, one, 35 quite a young man, an Achæan from 36 Helice by the sea-shore, who in truth, look you, was also discoursing among many of the Epeans, that one of the Argives in his presence had destroyed a wild beast, a savage lion, a monster of evil to rustics, having a hollow den 37 in the grove of Nemean Jupiter.
I know not accurately, whether he was from 38 sacred Argos, on the spot, or an inhabitant of the city of Tiryns, or Mycenæ.
Thus he at least used to say :
but by birth he reported that the hero was (that is, if I recollect rightly) 39 of the lineage of Perseus.
I deem that none other of the 40 Ægialæans, but you, has had the courage to do this deed, and the wild beast's hide, which envelopes your sides, very clearly bespeaks the work of your hands.
Come now, tell me first, (that I may know in my mind, O hero, whether I guess rightly or not,) if even you are that hero, 41 of whom the Achæan from Helice told us, his hearers, and I judge of you rightly.
And tell me how you yourself slew this dreadful wild beast, and how it came into the land of well-watered Nemea.
For such a monster you could not find, though you desired to see it, in 42 Apis;
since it surely rears none such, but only bears, and wild boars, 43 and the destructive seed of wolves.
Whereat they used to wonder then, as they heard the story, and some too even thought that the traveller was telling a falsehood, giving freely of a false tongue to please present company.
'Thus having spoken, Phyleus 44 made way from the middle of the road, that it might suffice for them to walk together upon, and also, I ween, that he might more easily hear Her­ cules speak, who, having accompanied him, addressed him in such a speech as follows.'
0 son of Augeas, as to that which you asked me first, you have yourself, and very easily, guessed aright.
And concern­ ing this monster, I will tell you each particular, how it was accomplished, since you desire to hear ;
that is to say, except whence it came;
for that, though there be many Argives, no one can clearly state:
|only we conjecture that some one of the immortals, 45 angry on account of sacrifices, inflicted the pest on the men descended from -Phoroneus.
For overwhelming, like a river, all 46 the men of Pisa, the lion kept ravaging them furiously, and most of all the 47 Bembinæans, who were dwell­ ing near to him, being in most intolerable plight.
Now this conflict Eurystheus imposed on me to accomplish first of all, for he desired that the savage beast might kill me.
But I took my supple bow, and hollow quiver filled with arrows, and set forth:
and in my other hand was my stout club, bark and all, of the shady wild olive, of a good size:
which I myself having found under sacred Helicon, had pulled up whole with its thick roots.
But when I had come to the place where the lion was, then it was that, having taken my bow, and applied the string to the 48 hooked tip, I forthwith set upon it a bane­ ful arrow.
And moving my eyes every where, I proceeded to look out for the destructive monster, if haply I might spy him, and that too before he had caught sight of me.
49 'Twas mid-day, and no where was I able to discern tracks of him, or to hear his roar.
No, nor was there any man, set over cattle, or engaged in tillage, to be seen throughout the arable land, whom I could question :
but pale fear was keeping each in his dwelling.
I had not however stayed my steps, recon­ noitring a woody mountain, ere I even beheld him, and straightway began to make trial of prowess.
In truth, he was 50 going before evening to his den, having fed on flesh and blood ;
and he had got his squalid mane, and grim visage, and chest, bespattered about with gore ;
and was licking his jaws with his tongue.
But I quickly hid myself amid shady bushes on a woody hill-top, awaiting when he might come upon me:
and I hit him, as he drew nearer, on his left flank, but 51 to no purpose;
for in no wise did the barbed missile penetrate through his flesh, but glancing back fell on the green herbage.
Then speedily did he raise in astonishment his blood- red head from the ground, and ran over it on all sides with his eyes, making his observations, and, in yawning, 52he hegave me a view of his gluttonous teeth.
Now at him I proceeded to shoot another arrow from the string, being vexed that before it had escaped fruitlessly from my hand, and I hit him be­ tween the breasts, where the lung is seated.
But not even so did the painful arrow pierce beneath the hide, but fell before his feet, absolutely to no purpose.
Again the third time I was preparing, though grievously disgusted in mind, to draw my bow anew, when the furious beast caught sight of me, 53 as he glared around with his eyeballs :
and 54 he rolled his great tail about the hollow of the knee, and quickly bethought him of battle:
his whole neck was swollen with rage, and his tawny mane 55 bristled, as he chafed ;
whilst his back-bone became curved, like a bow, as he gathered himself up from all sides towards his flanks and loins.
And as, when a chariot­ maker, skilled in many works, 56 bends shoots of the easily cleft wild fig-tree, having first warmed them in the fire, to be wheels for the chariot-seat on its axles, the thick-barked fig­ shoot is apt to fly from out his hands in the bending, and leaps to a distance with one bound, so upon me sprang 57all-at-once the fierce lion from afar, eager to glut himself on my flesh :
but I in one hand was holding before me my arrows, and my double-folded cloak from my shoulders, while with the other, having raised my dry club above his temple, I struck him 58 upon the head, but broke my sturdy olive club right in twain, there upon the shaggy skull of the enormous beast.
Ay, arid he fell, even before he reached me, from on high upon the earth, and stood upon trembling feet, nodding with his head :
for dimness had come over both his eyes, the brain having received a concussion within the skull from the violence.
Now when I observed him to be stunned by severe pain, ere at least he had recovered himself and breathed afresh, being beforehand I struck him on the nape of his sturdy neck, hav­ ing cast on the ground my bow and well-sewn quiver:
and I proceeded to throttle him vigorously, having set my strong hands firmly together behind him, lest he should lacerate my flesh with his claws ;
59 and with my heels I kept strenuously pressing to the ground his hinder feet, having mounted upon him :
while with his sides I kept protecting my thighs, until I had strained his shoulders to the uttermost, having lifted him upright, 60breathless as he was :
and Hades received a monster soul.
And then, in fact, I began to deliberate how I should draw the shaggy hide from off the limbs of the dead beast, 61 a very laborious task:
for it was not able to be cut with steel, nor with stones, though I tried, no, nor with wood.
Thereupon one of the immortals put it into my mind to devise, how to rip up the skin of the lion with his own claws.
With these I speedily flayed him, and placed the skin around my limbs, that it might be to me a defence against skin-wounding Enyalius.
Such, look you, friend, was the destruction of the Nemean monster, after he had first brought many deaths upon sheep and men.
'This poem narrates the slaughter of Pentheus, king of Thebes.
While Agave his mother, with her sisters, Ino and Autonoe, is celebrating the orgies of Bacchus, Pentheus is spied by the Bacchants, concealed amongst some shrubs.
Hereupon they make an attack upon the un­ fortunate offender, and, under the influence of Bacchic phrensy, seize him and mangle him.
At the close of the poem, our poet prays the gods that it may be permitted him to live purely and safely, and adds an encomium on Bacchus and Semele.
The subject has been treated by Euripides and by Lucius Accius, his translator.
See also Ovid's Metamorph.
iii. 701—733.INO and Autonoe, and 1 apple-cheeked Agave, led three 2 companies, themselves being three, to a mountain.
And they indeed having plucked wild foliage of a 3 bushy oak, and green ivy, and asphodel that grows over the ground, had reared 4in an open meadow twelve altars, the three for Semele, the nine for Bacchus:
and, when they had taken in their hands 5from the mystic chest curiously-wrought sacred images, had laid them down silently upon the 6 newly plucked altars, as Bacchus himself was wont to teach, as himself was well pleased it should be.
But Pentheus was beholding all from a high rock, creeping under an ancient mastich tree, a shrub of the country.
Autonoe first spied him, and raised a fearful cry, and rushing in suddenly, with her feet disturbed the orgies of frantic Bac­ chus:
and these, 7 uninitiated persons behold not.
Maddened indeed both she, and maddened, I ween, straightway also others.
Pentheus was flying affrighted;
while they kept pursu­ ing, having drawn-up-tight their robes by the waist to the knee.
Now Pentheus spake thus, ‘What want ye, women ?' But Autonoe said this, ‘Soon shalt thou know, ere thou hast heard it.'
His mother, on the one hand, roared out, as she seized the head of her son, deeply 8as is the roar of a lioness with cubs:
and Ino on the other hand brake his great shoulder with the shoulder-blade, when f'he had trampled on his belly:
and the same was Autonoe's manner of acting:
and the rest of the women tore in pieces the remainder of his flesh, and arrived at Thebes all of them stained with blood, bearing from the mountain 9not Pentheus but πένθημα.
I care not 10for it, nor let another think of being hostile to Bacchus, not even though one has suffered worse treatment than this, and is but nine years old, or even entering on his tenth year.
But may I be pure and holy, and please the pure and holy.

Hail to Bacchus, whom on snowy 12 Dracanus supreme Ju­ piter- deposited, having relieved his vast thigh:
and hail to beauteous Semele, and her Cadmeian sisters, objects of love and care to many heroines, who at the instigation of Bacchus performed this deed, undeserving of blame:
- let no one blame the acts of the gods.
In this truly pastoral Idyll, the herdsman Daphnis is represented as striving to win a maiden, who is tending her goats.
His efforts at wooing and the damsel's coyness are very graphically pictured.
There has been much dispute as to the authorship of this Idyll, which some ascribe to Moschus;
others, to an imitator of Theocritus;
whilst Warton, Eichstadt, and others, agree in determining that it is not the work of Theocritus.
Daphnis.

The prudent Helen Paris, another herdsman, carried off:
my Helen here is kissing me, the herdsman, rather.
Damsel.
Brag not, little satyr, 'tis said the kiss is an empty favour.
Daph. 3
There is even in empty kisses sweet delight.
Dams.
I wipe my mouth, and spit out your kiss.
Daph.
Dost wipe thy lips ?
Give me them again that I may kiss.
Dams.
'Tis good for you to kiss heifers, not 4an unwedded girl.
Dach.
Boast not:
for soon youth passes by you, like a dream.
Dams.
The bunch of grapes is still a bunch of raisins, and the withered rose will not perish wholly.
Daph.
Come under the wild olives, that I may tell thee a tale.
Dams.
I don't choose:
before now you have cajoled me by sweet tales.
Daph.
Come beneath the elms, that you may hear my pipe.
Dams.
Satisfy your own taste:
nothing sorry 5pleases me.
Daph.
Fie, fie, regard, yes, even thou, maiden, the wrath of the Paphian goddess.
Dams.
Farewell to her of Paphos!
Only be Diana pro­ pitious!
Daph.
Say not so;
lest she smite you, and you come into an inextricable net.
Dams.
Let her smite as she will!
On the other hand, Diana aids me.
Lay not your hand upon me.
6
If you do, I will tear your lip too..
Daph.
You do not escape Love, whom never did other maiden escape.
Dams.
I do escape him, yes, by Pan !
But you ever bear the.
yoke.
Daph.
I fear lest, in truth, he shall give thee to a worse man.
Dams.
Many were my wooers:
but not one pleased my taste.
Daph.
I too, as one of many, come hither as your suitor !
Dams.
And what can I do, kind sir ?
Marriages are full of trouble.
Daph.
Nor care nor grief hath marriage, but dancing !
Dams.
Well, but in sooth they say that women fear their husbands.
Daph.
Rather they always rule them !
Whom do women fear ?
Dams.
I fear to be in labour :
Lucina's dart is painful.
Daph.
But your queen is Diana, 7 that helps in hard labours.
Dams.
But I fear to be a mother;
lest I should lose my fair complexion.
Dach.
Yet, if you shall have borne dear children, you will see a new light in your sons.
Dams.
And what 8 nuptial gift bring you me, worth marry­ ing for, if I should consent.
Daph.
You shall have all the herd;
all the groves, and pasture.
Dams. 9
Swear not to go away after wedding, deserting me against my wish ?
Daph.
I will not indeed, no, by Pan;
even though you should wish 10 to drive me off.
Dams.
Are you going to build me a nuptial chamber, and build me a house and stalls ?
Daph.
I am building thee chambers :
and the flocks I tend are beautiful.
Dams.
And what, what story should I tell my aged father ?
Daph.
He will approve your marriage, when he has heard my name.
Dams.
Say that name of thine :
even a name often pleases.
Daph.
I am Daphnis;
and my sire Lycidas, and my mother Nomæa.
Dams.
You come of gentle blood !
but I am no worse than you.
Daph.
Neither are you honourable in the highest degree;
for your sire is Menalcas.
Dams.
Show me your grove, where your stall stands.
Daph.
Come hither and see how my tall cypresses bloom.
Dams.
Feed ye, my she-goats :
I shall go see the works of the herdsman.
Daph. 11Graze well, my bulls, whilst I show the maiden the groves.
12 ************Thus they indeed, delighting in young limbs, were whis­ pering one to the other.
13 A stolen embrace was springing up.
And she indeed, when she had arisen, I wot, went for­ ward to tend her flocks, showing shame in her eyes ;
but her heart was warmed within :
and he proceeded to his herds of oxen, rejoiced at his marriage.
This sweet ditty was written to commend an ivory distaff, which the poet, about to sail to Miletus, intended as a present for Theugenis, the wife of Nicias the physician.
Under the semblance of teaching the distaff what sort of a mistress it is about to have, he cleverly and gracefully praises a most honourable matron and her husband.
The Idyll is of the lyric class;
the metre Choriambic;
a favourite of Alcæus, and one which Horace imitates in the 18th Ode of the first book.
O DISTAFF, practised in wool-spinning, gift of blue- eyed Minerva, labour at thee is fitting to wives who are pru­ dent-housekeepers.
Attend me confidently to the famous city of 2Neleus, where is 3 the temple of Venus, green by reason of the soft reed.
For thither we ask of Jove a favourable voyage, that 41 may be gratified by the sight of my friend Nicias, and be loved by him in turn ;
Nicias, a sacred scion of the Graces of lovely voice;
and may present thee, that wast wrought of much worked ivory, to the hands of the wife of Nicias, as a gift.
With her you will finish off much work for men's robes, and many 5gauze-like garments, such as women wear.
For twice in the same year will the mothers of lambs yield their soft fleeces to be shorn in the pastures, even for the sake of Theugenis of the beautiful ancle.
So industrious is she, and loves all that 6 discreet women love.
Now, I should not wish to present thee, as thou art from our land, to slack and idle houses.
7
For thy country is that which 8Archias from Ephyre founded of old, the richest part of the island, Trinacria, a city of men in repute.
Now indeed, keeping the house of a man who has learnt many saving medicines to ward off from men grievous diseases, you will dwell in lovely Miletus, among lonians ;
that among townsfolk Theugenis may have a good distaff, and you may ever and anon put her in mind of a friend who loves the song.
For looking at you, one shall say this to another:
‘Sure there is great grace with a trifling gift:
and all the gifts from friends are precious.
'
In the Idyll, which is of the lyric character, our poet blames the in.
constancy and fickleness of a beautiful youth, and urges him to con- suit his good name by better faith in future.
The metre is Æolic. .
See Hermann, Element. Doctr. Metr. p. 360, seq.1‘WINE,’ dear youth, ‘and truth,' is the saying;
and we must be true as drunkards.
And I indeed will tell what lies in the depths of my heart.
You choose not to love me with your whole soul, I know it:
2 for the half of life, which I have, lives in thy beauteous form, and the rest has perished.
And whensoever you choose, I pass a day like the gods ;
but when you choose not, I am wholly in gloom.
How is this seemly, 3to consign him that loves thee to cares ?
Nay, if you would be persuaded at all by me, the younger by the elder, then you yourself would be better circumstanced, and commend me for it;
build one nest in one tree, where no savage reptile shall reach.
But now you occupy one branch to-day, and another to-morrow;
and you seek one after another.
And suppose any one shall have seen and praised 4 your fair face, to him then you straightway become a friend of more than three years' date;
whilst you place your first admirer in the third rank.
You seem to savour of arrogant men.
Nay, prefer, as long as you live, to have always one like your­ self.
For if you thus do, you will be well-reported of by the citizens;
and Love would not be troublesome to you, Love, who easily subdues the minds of men, and hath wrought me into softness from being iron-hearted.
But be this as it may, 5I approach thee closely by thy tender lip. , are old, before you spurn us, and wrinkled;
and to have youth recalled is impossible ;
for it hath wings on its shoulders and we are 7too sloW to catch the flitting runaways.
Considering this, you must 8be more agreeable, and return my love, who love you without guile, that so, when you get your mannish chin, we may be to each other fast friends like Achilles.
But if you commit these words to the winds to bear away, and say in your heart, Good fellow, why do you trouble me ?' now let me go for love of thee, even after the golden apples, and in quest of Cerberus, guardian of the dead ;
but then, not even though you called me, would I come forth at the hall-doors, having ceased from violent love.
When Venus, on the death of Adonis, had bidden a boar, the author of the crime, be brought before her, the animal tries to excuse his sin, by pleading, that he had been smitten by love of the beauteous youth, and had therefore longed to kiss his limbs.
Then he surren­ ders himself to Venus, that she may inflict upon him the penalty due to his guilt.
The goddess, taking pity, orders him to go free.
In con­ sequence of which, the boar thenceforth voluntarily attends Venus.
The argument, no less than metre, of this Idyll prove it Anacreontic:
but though Warton deems it the work of Anacreon, or an imitator, it seems to have had a place among the Idylls of Theocritus, from the very oldest edition.
Person says of it, ad Aristoph.

The metre runs .
Herm.
Elem. Doctr. Metr. p. 475.WHEN
Cytherea beheld Adonis already dead, with locks unkempt, and his cheek pale, she bade the Loves bring the wild boar before her.
And they forthwith on wings, 1having traversed all the wood, found out the 2 hateful boar, and bound him once and again.
And one, having tied him with a rope, was dragging on his captive ;
while another, driving him in the rear, kept striking him with his arrows.
Now the beast was advancing timidly, for he was afraid of Cytherea.
Then Aphrodite said to him, ‘Thou worst of all wild beasts, didst thou wound this thigh?
Hast thou stricken 3my lover?'
But the beast answered thus, ‘I swear to thee, Cytherea, by thyself and thy lover, and these my bonds, and these my hunters, I did not wish to wound thy beauteous lover !
but I gazed on him 4 as though I had been a statue, and not being able to endure my warmth, I was mad to kiss the limb which he had bare ;
and then 5my tooth hurt him.
Take these, 0 Venus, and punish them, wrench out (for why do I carry them beyond the due number ?) these passionate teeth.
But if these do not satisfy thee, then take these my lips also ;
for why did they dare to kiss ?
'But Venus pitied him, and bade the Loves to loose his bonds.
Thenceforth he was wont to attend her, and would not go to the woods ;
6and having approached the fire, kept burning his loves.
This fragment from the Berenice, as it is inscribed, is given by Athenæus vii. 284, A. Casaub., and mentioned by Eustathius ad Horn.
Iliad v., ἱερὸν ἰχθύν, p. 1067, 41.
Berenice, called θέος in verse 3, is the Queen of Egypt, wife of Ptolemy Lagidas, who was divinely honour­ ed by her son Ptolemy Philadelphia, (Idyll xv. 106—108, xvii. 34, &c.,) and was supposed to vouchsafe most benignantly all the bless­ ings of plenty.
AND if a man asks good sport and wealth for himself, 1whose subsistence is from the sea, and his nets are his ploughs, then let him slay 2 at nightfall to this goddess a sacred fish, which men call ‘white,' for it is the sleekest of all others ;
and then he will set his nets, and draw them up out of the sea full.
THESE 1dewy roses and yon thick 2 creeping-thyme are dedicated to the Heliconian Muses.
And the dark-leaved bays to thee, 0 Pythian Paean :
for the 3 Delphic rock hath given thee this for an ornament.
And this 4white he-goat with the horns, browsing the extremity of a branch of the turpentine tree, shall stain thy altar.
5
DAPHNIS the fair-complexioned, that did modulate pastoral hymns with beautiful pipe, dedicated to Pan these gifts;
his reed-pipe with stops, his shepherd's crook, his sharp dart, his fawn's skin, and 6 the wallet, in which he once used to carry apples.
DAPHNIS, you sleep on leaf-strown ground, I resting your wearied body;
and the 2 poles are fresh fastened along the mountains.
But Pan is in chase of you, and 3Priapus, who has saffron-berried ivy bound about his lovely head, advancing to the interior of the cave with one bound.
But do you take flight, fly, having 4 shaken off the lethargy of sleep, that is stealing over you.
5
WHEN you have turned down yon lane, goatherd, where the oaks are, you will find 6 a fresh-carved image of fig-wood, 7 with three legs, with the bark on, and without handles, but with creative phallus able to accomplish works of Venus:
and an enclosure duly sacred surrounds it, and an ever-run­ ing stream from the hollow rocks luxuriates on all sides in laurels and myrtles, and fragrant cypress :
where the grape­ begetting vine sheds itself around with its tendrils, and ver- nal blackbirds, with sweet-voiced songs, chaunt various-noted melodies :
yellow nightingales respond with their plaints, warbling with their throats the sounds of music.
Prythee, take your seat there, and supplicate the graceful Priapus, that I may discourage the loves of Daphnis :
and say that I will straightway sacrifice a fine he-goat:
but if he shall have re­ fused, I am willing, after having succeeded in this, to pay three victims.
1For I will offer a heifer, a shaggy he-goat, and a lamb which I am keeping in the stall:
and may the god hear propitiously.
ARE you willing, I ask you by the Nymphs, to sing me some sweet trifle on the 2 double flutes ?
And I will take up 3a harp, and begin to strike it somewhat:
and the cowherd Daphnis shall charm us at the same time, singing to the breathing 4 of a wax-bound pipe.
Then standing near a leafy oak, behind the cave, would we rob of sleep 5the goat-footed Pan.
All !
thou wretched Thyrsis, what boots it thee, if thou waste with tears thy two eyes in lamentation !
The young she-goat 6 is gone, the pretty kid is gone to the shades ;
for a ruthless wolf crushed her with his talons.
And 7 the dogs then give tongue.
What boots it, when, gone as she is, nor a bone nor ash is left of her ?
THE son of Paean came even to Miletus, 2to dwell along with a man that heals diseases, Nicias by name:
3who ever day by day approaches him with sacrifices, and has had this statue carved out of 4 fragrant cedar, having promised the highest price to Eetion, because of his skilful hand ;
and he has thrown all his art into the work.
STRANGER, Orthon, a man of Syracuse, gives thee this charge:
Walk no where, in your cups, of a wintry night.
For such is the fate, which I have met:
and 5 instead of my ample father land, I lie having wrapped myself in foreign soil.
GOOD man, 6 be careful of your life, nor be a voyager out of season:
since life is not long to a man.
Wretched Cleoni­ cus, you, on the other hand, were in haste to go as a merchant from 1Coelesyria to fruitful 2Thasos.
Ay, a merchant, 0 Cleonicus ;
but crossing ocean just about the 3 very setting of the Pleiad, you went down along with the Pleiad.
To you, goddesses, Xenocles dedicated this marble statue, in gratitude 4 to Nine altogether:
a musician, no one will say otherwise, and enjoying repute on the score of this talent, he is not forgetful of the Muses.
THIS monument is of Eusthenes :
he was the philosopher 5 who judged men by their features;
being clever at learning even the mind from the eye.
Worthily have his friends buried him, though a foreigner, in a foreign land:
6 and to lyric poets he was wondrously dear.
The philosopher in death bath all it was fitting he should have;
even though he was powerless, I wot he found friends-to-care-for-him.
DEMOTELES, 2the leader of the choir, who set up the tripod, 0 Dionysus, and 3 thee the sweetest of gods, was pretty- 4 well-in-merit among boys ;
but in the choir of men he gained victory, seeing both the beautiful and the becoming.
5 OUR
Venus is not the vulgar :
propitiate the goddess by having called her ‘heavenly,' the offering of chaste Chryso­ gona in the house of Amphicles, with whom she had both children and life in common ;
and ever it was better to them 6 from year to year, 7 as they began with thee, 0 divine lady;
for if they care for the immortals, mortals find advantage in it themselves.
You left an infant son ;
and yourself too in life's prime, Eurymedon, found a tomb here, in death.
For you indeed there is 1a seat amid godlike men ;
but him citizens will honour, remembering his sire as worthy.
TRAVELLER, I shall know, whether you pay any more honour to the good, than the bad, or if even the coward gets likewise an equal share from you.
You will say 2 Hail to this tomb, for it lies light upon the sacred head of Eurymedon.
STRANGER, regard this statue 3 carefully, and say, when you have returned home, 4‘In Teos, I saw a likeness of Anacreon, 5 pre-eminent, if ever man was, among bards of old.'
And by having added also, that he delighted in the young, you will truthfully describe the whole man.
BOTH the inscription is Doric, and the lOOn, he who in- vented comedy, 1Epicharmus.
0 Bacchus, to thee 2the Pelo­ rians, who are settled in the city of Syracuse, set him up here in brass instead of in his true nature, inasmuch as they are mindful to pay the price of his labours to a fellow citizen, a for he had abundance of wealth ;
for many saws useful for life and conduct taught he to their children.
Great gratitude is due to him.
THE little Medeius raised this monument by the way-side to his of Thracian nurse, and inscribed it ‘Of Cleita.'
The woman will enjoy his thanks in requital for her having reared the boy.
Why not ?
5She has yet another name, Useful.
STAND and behold the ancient poet, ! Archilochus, him of the Iambics, whose 2 infinite renown has reached both to the west and to the east.
Of a truth, I ween, the Muses and Delian Apollo were wont to love him:
so melodious was he, and skilful both in making Iambics and singing to his lyre.
FOR you this man, 3 Pisander from Camirus, first of the former poets, wrote the exploits of Jove's son, the lion-subduer, the quick-of-hand;
and declared how many labours he had ac­ complished.
And this very man, that you may duly know it, the people setup here, having made him of brass, .. many months and years afterwards.
HERE lies 5Hipponax the poet.
If thou art worthless, come not nigh his tomb ;
but if thou art both 1good, and come of good stock, sit down boldly, and sleep, if thou wilt.
2THE Chian Theocritus is another ;
but I, Theocritus who wrote these Idylls, am a Syracusan, one of the commonalty, 3son to Praxagoras and well-known Philina, and I have never 4 claimed to myself another's muse.
THIS bank allows the same to strangers as to citizens.
Deposit your money, and take it up again, 5a calculation being duly made.
Let some one else make excuses;
but 6Caicus tells back the monies of others, even by night if they wish it.
7 THE inscription will declare what is the tomb, and who under it:
I am the grave of her that was called Glaucè.
I WAIL for Adonis ;
beauteous Adonis is dead.
‘Dead is beauteous Adonis;
' the Loves join in the wail.
Sleep no more, Venus, in purple vestments ;
rise, wretched goddess, in thy robes of woe, 1and beat thy bosom, and say to all, ‘Beau­ teous.
Adonis hath perished.'
I wail for Adonis:
the Loves join in the wail.'
Low lies beauteous Adonis on the moun­ tains, having his white thigh smitten by a tusk, a white tusk, and he inflicts pain on Venus, as he breathes out his life faintly ;
but adown his white skin trickles the black blood ;
and his eyes are glazed neath the lids, and the rose flies from his lip;
and round about it dies also the kiss, which Venus will never relinquish.
To Venus, indeed, his kiss, even though he lives not, is pleasant, yet Adonis knew not that she kiss­ ed him as he died.
I wail for Adonis:
the Loves wail in concert.
A cruel, cruel wound hath Adonis in his thigh, 2 but a greater wound doth Cytherea bear at her heart.
Around that youth 3indeed faithful hounds whined, and Oread Nymphs weep;
but Aphrodite, having let fall her braided hair, wanders up and down the glades, sad, unkempt, 4 unsandaled, and the brambles tear her as she goes, and 5cull her sacred blood:
then wailing piercingly she is borne through long valleys, crying for her 6 Assyrian spouse, and calling on her youth.
But around him dark blood was gushing up about his navel, and his breasts were empurpled from his thighs, and to Adonist the parts beneath his breasts, white before, became now deep-red.
Alas, alas for Cytherea, the Loves join in the wail.
She hath lost her beauteous spouse, she hath lost with him her divine beauty.
Fair beauty had Venus, when Adonis was living ;
but with Adonis perished the fair form of Venus, alas, alas !
All mountains, and the oaks say, ‘Alas for Adonis.'
7
And rivers sorrow for the woes of Aphrodite;
and springs on the mountains weep for her Adonis, and 8 flowers redden from grief;
whilst Cytherea sings mournfully along all 9 woody-mountain-passes, and along cities.
Alas, alas for Cytherea, beauteous Adonis bath perished.
And Echo cried in response, 'Beauteous Adonis bath perished.'
10 Who would not have lamented the dire love of Venus ?
alas !
alas !
When she saw, when she perceived the wound of Adonis, which none might stay, when she saw gory blood about his wan thigh, unfolding wide her arms, she sadly cried, ' Stay, ill- fated Adonis, Adonis, stay :
that I may find thee for the last time, that I may enfold thee around, and mingle kisses with kisses.
Rouse thee a little, Adonis, and again this last time kiss me :
kiss me just so far as there is life in thy kiss, 11till from thy heart thy spirit shall have ebbed into my lips and soul, and I shall have drained thy sweet love-potion, and 12have drunk out thy love:
and I will treasure this kiss, even as if it were Adonis himself, since thou, ill-fated one, dost flee from me.
Thou flyest afar, 0 Adonis, 13and comest unto Acheron, and its gloomy and cruel king ;
but wretched I live, and 14 am a goddess, and cannot follow thee.
Take,
Proserpine, my spouse :
for thou art thyself far more power­ ful than I, 15and the whole of what is beautiful falls to thy share ;
yet I am all-hapless, and feel insatiate grief, and mourn for Adonis, since to my sorrow he is dead, and I am afraid of thee.
Art thou dying, 0 thrice-regretted ?
16
Then my longing is fled as a dream ;
and widowed is Cytherea, and idle are the Loves along my halls :
and with thee has my charmed-girdle been undone ;
nay, why, rash one, didst thou hunt ?
Beauteous as thou wert, wast thou mad enough to contend with wild beasts ?'
Thus lamented Venus ;
the Loves join in the wail.
Alas, alas for Cytherea, beauteous Adonis has perished.
The Paphian goddess sheds as many tears as Adonis pours forth blood:
and these all, on the ground, become flowers :
17 the blood begets a rose, and the tears the anemone.
I wail for Adonis :
beauteous Adonis hath perish­ ed. Lament no more, Venus, thy wooer in the glades :
there is a goodly couch, there is a bed of leaves ready for Adonis ;
this bed of thine, Cytherea, dead Adonis occupies;
and though a corpse, he is beautiful, a beautiful corpse, as it were sleeping.
Lay him down on the 18 soft vestments in which he was wont to pass the night:
in which with thee along the night he would take his holy sleep, on a couch all-of-gold;
yearn thou for Adonis, sad-visaged though he be now:
and lay him 19 amid chaplets and flowers ;
all with him, since he is dead, 20 ay, all flowers have become withered :
but sprinkle him with myrtles, sprinkle him with unguents, with perfumes :
perish all perfumes, thy perfume, Adonis, hath perished.
Delicate Adonis reclines in purple vestments ;
and about him weeping Loves set up the wail, 21 having their locks shorn for Adonis :
-and one was trampling on his arrows, another on his bow, and 22 another was breaking his well-feathered quiver ;
and one has loosed the sandal of Adonis, while an­ other is carrying water in golden ewers, and a third is bathing his thighs ;
and another behind him is fanning Adonis with his wings.
The Loves join in the wail for Cytherea herself:
Hy­ menæus has quenched every torch at the door-posts, and shredded the nuptial wreath;
and no more is 23 Hymen, no more Hymen the song that is sung, alas !
alas !
is chanted:
alas, alas for Adonis, wail the Graces, far more than Hy­ menæus, for the son of Cinyras, saying one with another, ‘ Beauteous Adonis hath perished and far more piercingly speak they, than thou, 24 Dione.
The Muses too strike up the lament for Adonis, and invoke him by song, but he heeds them not;
not indeed that he is unwilling, but Proserpine does not release him.
Cease, Cytherea, thy laments, refrain this day from thy dirges.
25 Thou must wail again, and weep again, another year.
A BIRD-CATCHER, yet a boy, hunting birds in a leafy grove, spied Eros, 1from whom men-turn-away, perched on the branch of a box-tree ;
and when he had observed him, in delight because in sooth it seemed to him a great bird,2 fitting together one on another his rods all at once, he proceeded to lay a trap for Eros, as he hopped 3 hither and thither.
And the lad, being chagrined that no success befell him, threw down-his rods, and went to an old rustic, who had taught him this art;
and spoke to him, and showed him Eros perch­ ing.
4
But the old man, gently smiling, wagged his head, and answered the boy:
' Beware of thy sport, and come not at yon bird ;
fly far from it;
'tis an evil brute;
happy will you be, 5 so long as you shall not have caught it;
but if you shall have reached to man's stature, yon bird that now flees, and hops away, will come himself of his own accord, on a sudden, 6 and settle upon your head.
'THE mighty Venus stood beside me, when I was yet 1 in youth's prime, leading with her fair hand infant Eros, nodding towards the ground;
and addressed me as follows, ‘ Prythee, good herdsman, take and teach Eros to sing.'
Thus said she, and herself went away;
but I, witless as I was, began to teach Eros, as though he wished to learn, as many pastorals as I knew ;
namely, how 2Pan invented the cross-flute, how Athena the pipe, how 3 Hermes the lyre, and how sweet Apollo the cithern.
These I began to teach him;
but he did not take heed to my words, but himself kept singing me love- ditties, and teaching me 4 the desires of mortals and immortals, and his mother's doings.
And I forgot indeed all the strains which I was teaching Eros, but whatsoever love-ditties Eros taught me, I learned them all.
THE Muses fear not the savage Eros, but love him from their hearts, and follow him close behind.
And if haply one follow them having an unloving spirit, out of that man's way they fly, and are not willing to teach him.
But if a man agitated in mind by Eros sing sweetly, to him every one of them hasten 1 in flowing stream.
I am witness that this state­ ment is 2 universally true ;
for if indeed I sing of any other mortal or immortal, my tongue 3 stutters, and sings no longer as before;
but if again I warble any ditty to Eros, and to Lycidas, 4why then the strain flows joyously through my lips.
1
I KNOW not how, nor is it fitting I should, to labour at what I have not learned.
If my ditties are beautiful, then these only, which the 2 Muse has presented to me aforetime, will give me renown.
But if these be not to men's taste, what boots it me to labour at more ?
For if indeed Saturn's son or shifting fate had given to us a twofold life-time, so that one term might be spent on pleasure and delights, and the other in toil, 'twere possible perhaps for one, having first laboured, at some after-period to receive the fruits.
But since the gods have allowed but one time for living to come to men, 3 and this a short space, and too brief for all, 4 how long, ah wretched men, do we toil over labours and works ?
And how far are we to throw our whole souls upon gains and upon arts.
longing ever for much more wealth ?
Surely we have all forgotten that we were born mortal, and how brief a time we have had assigned to us by fate.
Cleodamus.
1 OF spring, good Myrson, or winter, or autumn, or summer, what is pleasant to you ?
And what do you desire most to come ?
Is it summer, when all things, as many as we labour at, are completed ?
Or sweet autumn, when hunger comes but lightly on men ?
Or is it even 2idle winter ?
since 'tis e'en in winter that many, while they warm themselves, 3 are overpowered by laziness and sloth.
Or is beauteous spring more agreeable to you ?
Tell me what your inclination prefers ;
for our leisure has given us leave to speak.
Myrson.
For mortals to judge divine works is unmeet;
for all these are holy and sweet;
yet for your sake, Cleodamus, I will speak out which is to me more sweet than all the rest.
I would not it were summer, 4for then the sun scorches me.
I would not it were 5 autumn, for then ripe fruits breed disease.
I dread to endure terrible winter, its falling snow and frosts.
Come spring to me thrice-welcome in the 6 whole year, when there is neither frost, nor does sun oppress us.
In spring every thing is fruitful.
All sweet things burst forth in spring, 7 and night is equal to men, and morning the same.
PERPLEXITY seized on 1 Phœbus experiencing so great grief;
he began to seek every remedy, and strove to obtain a cunning art.
And with ambrosia and nectar he anointed, he anointed all the wound;
but for the fates all remedies are remediless.
BLESSED are they who love, 2whensoever they are loved equally in return.
Blest was 3 Theseus, when Pirithous was with him, even though he had descended to the abode of re­ lentless Hades.
Blest was Orestes among the 4 churlish inhospitables, because Pylades had chosen common paths with him.
5 Achilles, grandson of Æacus, was fortunate in his friend's life-time, blessed was he in his death, because he warded off from him dire fate.
IT is pot well, my friend, on every occasion to have re­ course to a craftsman, nor at all in every matter to have need of another, but 1do you even yourself fashion a Pan's pipe ;
and it is an easy task for you.
MAY
Eros invite the Muses, may the Muses bring Eros :
and to me, always yearning after it, may the Muses give song, the sweet song, than which 2 no charm is sweeter.
3
FROM the frequent drop, as the saying is, ever falling, even the stone is bored into a hollow.
BUT I will go on my way to yon slope, 4 warbling at the sands of the shore, whilst I supplicate cruel Galatea :
for I will not relinquish my sweet hopes even till extreme old-age.
NEITHER leave me unrewarded, since even Phoebus gave a reward to song.
And honour makes the things we do better.
5 BEAUTY is woman's grace:
but man's is courage.
Myrson.
Are you willing now, Lycidas, sweetly to sing me 2 a Sicilian melody, delightsome, charming the mind, and amorous, such as the.
Cyclops Polyphemus sung on the sea- shore to Galatea ?
Lycidas.
And if, Myrson, it be agreeable to me to sing to my pipe, then what shall my song be ?
Myrs.
I admire, Lycidas, the Scyrian strain, sweet love, the stolen kisses, the 3 stolen embrace of the son of Peleus.
How he, a boy, put on a maiden's mantle, and how he belied his form, and how among the daughters of Lycomedes, Deidamia, 4 holding him in her arms, gratified Achilles, son of Peleus.
Lycid.
Once on a day, the herdsman carried off Helen ;
and led her to Ida, a sore grief to Ænone ;
then Lacedæmon was wroth, and gathered all the Achæan host.
Nor did any man of Hellas, of Mycenæ, or Elis, or of the Laconians, stay behind in his home, 5bearing as vengeance dread war.
But only Achilles was lying concealed among the daughters of Ly­ comedes, and was learning skill in wool, instead of arms, and in his white hand was holding a maiden's 6task;
and in ap­ pearance he was as a girl;
for he was equally womanish with them, and as fresh a colour as theirs blushed on his snowy cheeks;
and he was wont to walk with the step of maiden­ hood, and to cover his hair with a veil;
yet had he the spirit of Mars, and possessed the love of a man, and from dawn to nightfall would he sit beside Deidamia ;
and at times indeed he would kiss her hand, and often 7 would he raise her beau­ teous mouth, and the sweet tears would flow forth.
But with no other of like age did he eat;
and he kept doing every thing in eagerness for a sleep in common.
Then he spoke also a word to her, ‘ With one another other sisters slumber, but I remain alone, and thou sleepest 8 apart from me;
we two, vir­ gins of like age, we twain beautiful.
Yet sleep we alone in our several beds, and this evil and troublesome partition-wall 9 wickedly separates me from you.
For not of you am I—’10HESPER!
'golden light of the lovely Foam-born !
Hesper, dear friend, sacred ornament of dark night, hail, thou friend, 2as much more faint than the moon, as thou art eminent above the stars;
and give thou me, as I go a merry-making to a shep­ herd, light instead of the moon :
because she, beginning her course to-day, went down too quickly.
I am not going forth for theft, nor to molest a wayfarer in the night:
but I am a lover;
and 'tis meet to return a lover love for love.
GENTLE Cyprus-born goddess, child of Jove and the sea, why art thou so wroth with mortals and immortals ?
I have said but little;
rather, why dost thou so much hate them, and why, prythee, shouldest thou have given birth to Eros, so great a plague to all, cruel as he is, without natural affection, in mind nowise resembling his form ?
And to what end hast thou given him to us 3 winged and a far-darter, that we might not be able to escape him, bitter as he is.
1‘
My son Eros,' Venus was loudly calling, 'Eros, if any one has seen straying in the cross-roads, he is my runaway:
the informer shall have a reward.
The kiss of Venus shall be your pay;
and if you shall have brought him, not the 2 bare kiss, but, stranger, you shall have even more:
now the lad is very notable;
you would know him among 3twenty together:
in complexion indeed he is not fair, but like to fire;
and his eyes are piercing and fiery-red:
evil his heart, pleasant his speech.
For he does not speak the same as he thinks;
his voice is as honey, 4but if he be wroth, his mind is ruthless;
deceiving, telling truth in nothing, wily child, he 5 sports cruelly.
His head has goodly curls, but "impudent is the face he wears:
his little hands are tiny, 'tis true, yet they shoot far;
shoot even to Acheron, and to the king of Hades.
He is naked indeed so far as his body is concerned, but his mind is 7 shrouded.
And being winged, as a bird, he flies upon now one party of men and women and now another, and settles on their inmost hearts.
He has a very small bow, and upon the bow an arrow:
small is his arrow, yet it carries even to the sky:
and a golden quiver above his back, and within it are the bitter shafts, with which he often wounds even me.
All, all is cruel;
but far most a little torch that he has, 8with which he kindles the sun himself.
If you at any rate shall have caught him, bind and bring him, and do not pity him.
And if ever you shall have seen him weeping, be­ ware lest he beguile you ;
and if he smile, do you drag him on :
and if he should desire to kiss you, avoid it;
his kiss is mischievous, 9his lips poison.
But should he say, ‘ Take these, I present thee all the arms I have,' do not touch them, de­ ceitful gifts;
for they have all been dipt in fire.
'VENUS once sent upon Europa a sweet dream, what time the third portion of night sets in, and dawn is near;
what time sleep sweeter than honey settling on the eyelids, limb-relaxing though it is, fetters down the eyes with soft bond;
2what time moreover the tribe of truthful dreams is roving abroad.
Then as she slumbered in a chamber next the roof, the daugh­ ter of Phoenix, yet a maiden, Europa, fancied 3 that two conti­ nents were contending for her, Asia and the opposite coast, and they were in shape as women.
Now of these the one had the form of a foreign woman, whilst the other in truth re­ sembled a native, and hugged her more closely as her own child;
and kept saying that she-was her mother, and that herself had nurtured her.
But the other, using violence with strong hands, was drawing her away, nothing loth:
for she said that 'twas fated by ægis-bearing Jove that Europa should be her prize.
She then started in affright from 4her strown couch, quak­ in- at heart, for she had beheld the dream as a real appear­ ance ;
and seating herself she kept silence a long time, yet still had she before her waking eyes both the women.
And late at length the maiden uplifted a timid voice, Who of the ce­ lestials has sent upon me such phantoms ?
What manner of dreams are these which have exceedingly scared me, as I slumbered right sweetly in my chamber on my strown couch ?
And who was that foreign woman, whom I beheld in my sleep?
How did a yearning toward her strike me at heart!
How graciously did she too welcome me, and regard me as her own child!
But may the blessed gods decide the dream to me for good.'
Thus saying, she sprang up;
and went to seek her dear companions, in the prime of life, 'her equals in years, well-pleasing, and nobly-born, with whom she was ever wont to sport, 5when she was making ready for the choir, or when she might be washing her skin at the mouths of 6the Anaurus, or whensoever 7 she might be culling odorous lilies from the mead.
And these quickly showed themselves to her, and they had each in their hands a basket for-holding-flowers;
and they proceeded to go to the meadows by-the-shore, where too they were ever wont to gather themselves in one troop, delighting both in the growth of the roses and in the roaring of the sea.
But Europa herself was carrying a basket wrought of gold, and ad­ mirable, a great wonder, a great work of Hephæstus, which he had bestowed on 8 Libya as a gift, when she went to the bed of the Earth-shaker;
and she gave it to very-beauteous Telephas­ sa, who was of near kin to her;
and upon Europa, yet unwed­ ded, her mother, Telephassa, bestowed it as a famous present.
Whereon many sparkling curious-works had been wrought;
on it indeed was wrought 9 of gold
Io the daughter of Inachus, while still a heifer, and she had not the figure of a woman.
And frantic she was going afoot over the briny paths, like unto one swimming;
and a sea had been wrought of dark blue.
And aloft, upon the brow of the shore, were standing two men together, and they were watching the sea-traversing heifer.
On it moreover was 10Jupiter, son of Saturn, patting gently with his hand the heifer daughter of Inachus, whom beside seven-mouthed Nile he was transforming again to a woman from a horned cow.
Of silver indeed was the stream of Nile;
and the heifer, I ween, of brass;
but Jove himself was fashioned of gold.
11 And about the crown of the rounded basket Hermes had been formed ;
and near to him Argus had been represented stretched, distinguished by his sleepless eyes ;
and from his deep-red blood was springing up a bird exulting in the many-hued colour of his wings, having spread wide the plumage of his tail, and like some ship speeding through the sea, he was covering all round with feathers the rims of the golden basket.
Such was very-beauteous Europa's basket.
Now these, when in truth they had entered the flowery meads, were then pleasing their fancy each with various kinds of flowers;
one of them was plucking odorous narcissus, another hyacinth, another the violet, and another the creeping thyme:
and on the ground were falling many leaves of spring-nursed 12 meadows.
But others again were culling in rivalry incense-laden tufts of yellow crocus;
in the midst however stood the princess, gathering with her hands the beauty of the bright-red rose, 13like as foam-born Venus shone conspicuous among the Graces.
Not long however was she destined to please her fancy on flowers, or to 14 preserve, I wot, her virgin zone undefiled.
For of a truth the son of Saturn, when he observed her, had then been smitten at heart, subdued by the unforeseen darts of Venus, who alone can overcome even Jove:
wherefore now, both as desiring-to- avoid the wrath of jealous Here, and wishing to beguile the young fancy of the maiden, he concealed the god, and trans­ formed his body, 15 and became a bull;
not such a one as feeds in the stalls, nor indeed such a one as cleaves a furrow, drag­ ging the curved plough;
nor like one that grazes in the herds, no, nor of such a kind as the bull that is tamed and draws the heavy-laden wain.
But of a truth the rest of his body was chestnut-coloured, whilst a silvery ring was gleaming on his mid forehead, and his eyes were 16 sparkling from under, flashing through desire;
and horns equal one to the other were branching up from his head, like orbs of the horned moon, her disc cut in half;
so came he into the meadow, and did not alarm the maidens by his appearance:
17but a longing to draw near to him arose in all, and to touch the lovely bull;
for his divine scent from afar surpassed even the sweet odour of the meadow.
And he stood before the feet of faultless Europa, and began to lick her neck, and to soften the maiden's heart.
Then would she stroke him, and gently with her hands wipe off from his lips much foam, and she kissed the bull.
But he 18 lowed softly:
you might say that you heard a 19Mygdonian flute, uttering distinctly a clear sound;
then he bent the knee before her feet, and began to look keenly on Europa, with his neck turned towards her, and to display to her his broad back.
Then she bespoke her maidens with-thick-falling hair thus, ‘ Come, dear playmates of like age, that we may delight ourselves in sitting on the bull here;
for in sooth he will spread his back beneath us, and take us all up, even as a ship;
mild is he to look upon, and gentle, nor is he at all like to other bulls ;
20 and a right mind, as of a man, surrounds him, and he wants but speech.'
Thus saying, 21 she took her seat smilingly on his back ;
and the rest were about to do so;
when straightway the bull sprang up, having carried off her whom he wished, and speedily he came to the sea.
But she having turned her round began to call her dear companions, outstretching her hands;
and they could not reach her, for having set foot on the strand he ran forward as a dolphin, and the Nereids emerged from out the brine, ay, the whole of them, I wot, arrayed themselves in line, 22 sitting on the backs of whales.
And moreover heavily-roaring Earth-shaker himself above the sea, levelling the waves, led the briny way for his brother;
and 23 the Tritons, dwellers in deep-flowing ocean, were gathered round him, sounding on long conches a nuptial melody.
But she truly, sitting on the bull-like shoulders of Jupiter, with one hand indeed kept holding the bull's long horn, whilst in the other hand she was drawing back the folds of her purple-flowing robe, in order that the countless spray of the hoary brine might not wet the skirt of it when drawn towards her.
Now the deep robe of Europa had been formed into loose folds at the shoulders, like the sail of a ship, and was wont to lighten the maiden.
But when at length she was far from her fatherland, and 24 there appeared neither any sea- dashed shore, nor tall mountain, but air indeed above, and boundless ocean beneath, peering round about her, she gave vent to words like these:
‘ Whither bearest thou me, divine bull ?
Who art thou ?
Or how dost thou traverse the way 25 with untiring feet, and yet not shudder at the sea ?
For by swift ships the sea is overrun, but bulls dread the briny path.
What kind of drink is sweet to thee ?
what food wilt thou get from the sea ?
Art thou in truth, I wonder, some god ?
For 26 thou dost acts beseeming the gods.
Neither do marine dolphins walk upon land, nor bulls in any wise on the sea.
But thou rushest unwetted over land and sea, and thine 27 hoofs are oars to thee.
Nay, haply also lifted aloft above the azure air, thou wilt take flight, resembling swift birds.
Ah me!
ill-fated assuredly in a high degree;
28even I who, having left afar my father's house, and followed this bull, am pursuing a strange voyage, and roaming alone.
But mayest thou, earth-shaking regent of the hoary sea, graciously light upon me !
I hope to behold this god directing my voyage, as my forerunner.
For not without a god's help do I traverse these watery paths.'
Thus spake she;
and her the broad­ homed bull addressed thus:
'Take heart, maiden, fear not ocean's billow:
I myself, look you, am Jove, though near at hand I seem to be a bull;
yes, for I am able to appear whatso­ ever I choose.
Now desire of thee hath impelled me to measure so much sea, taking the appearance of a bull:
but Crete shall receive thee presently, Crete, which reared even myself;
where shall be thy nuptials:
and by me thou shalt bear illustrious sons, who shall all of them be sceptre-bearers among the dwellers upon earth.
So said he:
and what he said found fulfilment:
Crete indeed at length appeared:
and Jove again assumed his own form.
And he loosed her girdle, and the 29 Hours prepared her bed, and she who was aforetime a maiden became presently bride of Jove. 30 And she bore sons to Jove and became a mother forthwith.[In connexion with this Idyll, Ovid Met. vi. 103, and Fast. v. 605— 612, may be read with advantage.

PLAINTIVELY groan at my bidding, ye woodland dells, and thou Dorian water, and weep, rivers, the lovely Bion;
now wail at my bidding, ye plants, and now, groves, utter a wail ;
now may ye flowers breathe forth your life in sad clusters ;
1 blush now sorrowfully, ye roses, now, thou anemone ;
2 now, hyacinth, speak thy letters, and with thy leaves lisp ‘ ai,' ‘ ai,' more than is thy wont:
a noble minstrel is dead.
Begin Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Ye nightingales, that wail in the thick foliage, tell the news to the Sicilian waters of 3Arethusa, that Bion the herdsman is dead, that with him both the song is dead, and perished is Doric minstrelsy.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Plaintively wail beside the waters, Strymonian swans, and with mournful voices sing a sorrowful ode, with as sweet a sound as was that of old, wherewith he used to sing to your lips.
4
And tell, again, to Æagrian maids, tell to all Bistonian nymphs, that the Dorian Orpheus has perished.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
That darling of the herds no longer sings:
no longer does he warble, as he reclines beneath the solitary oaks:
but in Pluto's realm he chants 5 a song of forgetfulness.
And voice­ less are the hills;
and the heifers, which roam with the bulls, lament and will not go to pasture.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Thy sudden fate, 0 Bion, even Apollo bewailed, and the , Satyrs grieved, and the dark-robed Priapi;
and Pans sigh for thy melody, whilst the fountain nymphs through the wood mourned for thee, 6 and their tears became waters ;
and Echo amid the rocks laments, because thou art mute, and mimics no more thy lips ;
and at thy death the trees have cast off their fruit, and the flowers have all withered;
good milk bath not flowed from ewes;
nor honey from hives;
but it has perished in the wax wasted with grief;
for no longer is it meet, now that thy honey is lost, to gather that.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
7Not so much did the dolphin lament beside the shores of the sea, nor so sang the nightingale ever on the rocks, no, nor* so much complained the swallow along the high mountains 8neither did Ceyx wail so much over the griefs of Halcyon.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
'Neither did Cerylus sing so much in the gray-green waves, nor so much 9did the bird of Memnon, fluttering around his tomb, deplore the son of Aurora in the valleys of the East, as they have bewailed Bion, having perished.
Begin, Silician Muses, begin the lament.
Nightingales, and all swallows, which once he was wont to delight, which he was teaching to speak, sitting on the branches, of trees, kept wailing opposite to each other, whilst the other birds kept responding, Grieve, ye doves, but we will do so too.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Who shall sing to thy pipe, 0 thrice-regretted ?
And who shall apply his lip to thy reeds ?
Who so bold ?
For even yet they breathe of thy lips and thy breath:
and Echo amid the reeds feeds upon thy songs.
To Pan I bear 10the pipe :
haply even he would fear to set his mouth to it, lest he should carry off a second prize after thee.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
11 Galatea too weeps for thy lay, she whom of old thou didst lelight, as she sat in thy company along the sea-beach.
For lot like Cyclops didst thou sing:
from him indeed the fair Galatea used to fly;
but thee she was wont to regard 12with ore sweetness than the sea.
And now, forgetful of the ve, she sits on the lonely sands, and even yet leads thy n to pasture.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
All along with thee, 0 herdsman, have perished the Muses' gifts, charming kisses of maidens, lips of boys :
and around thy tomb weep sad-visaged Loves.
Venus loves thee far more than the kiss, with which lately she kissed dying Adonis.
This is a second grief to thee, most musical of rivers !
This, 3 0 Meles, is a fresh grief;
to thy sorrow perished Homer foretime, that 14 sweet mouth of Calliope, and men say thou lidst deplore thine illustrious son in streams of much weeping, and didst fill all the sea with thy voice:
now again thou deepest another son, and pinest over a fresh woe.
Both were beloved by the fountains;
the one indeed was wont to drink )f the Pegasean .spring ;
the other, to enjoy a draught of the Arethusa.
And the one sang the fair daughter of Tyndarus, and the mighty son of Thetis, and Menelaus, son of Atreus:
but the other would sing not of wars, nor tears, but Pan;
and would sound the praise of herdsmen, and feed the herd as he sang :
and he was wont to fashion Pan's-pipes, and to milk the sweet heifer, and to teach the lips of youths, and to cherish Eros in his bosom, 'and rouse a passion in Aphrodite.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Every famous city laments thee, 0 Bion, as do all the towns:
16Ascra indeed wails for thee, far more than for Hesiod :
not so much does Bœotian Hylæ regret Pindar ;
nor so much did pleasant Lesbos weep about Alcæus:
no, nor bath the Ceian town wept for her bard so much.
Pares regrets thee more than Archilochus ;
and Mitylene yet plaintively utters thy melody instead of Sappho's.
All, as many as have a clear-sounding voice, all singers of pastorals by the Muses' favour, weep for thy fate, now thou art dead.
17 Sicelidas, the glory of Samos, weeps;
and among the Cydonians, he who was aforetime cheerful to look on with his smiling eye, Ly­ cidas, yet sheds tears as he wails :
whilst among the citizens of Cos, Philetas mourns beside the river Halens ;
and among Syracusans, Theocritus :
but I sing for thee a strain of 18 Au­ sonian sorrow, I, no stranger to the pastoral song, but heir to the Doric Muse, which thou didst teach thy scholars :
honouring me, to others indeed thou didst leave thy wealth, but to me thy song.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Alas, alas, when once in a garden the mallows have died, or the green parsley, or blooming crisp dill, they live again after, and spring up another year.
But we, the great, and brave, or wise of men, after we have once died, unheard of in hollow earth, sleep a right long and boundless slumber, from which none are roused.19
And in the earth thou indeed wilt be covered in silence, but it has seemed good to the Nymphs that the frog should croak for ever.
Yet I envy him not:
for 'tis no pretty song he sings.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
Poison came, 0 Bion, to thy lip:
thou knewest poison.
How did it find access to thy lips, yet not become sweet ?
or what mortal was so far ruthless, as to mix for thee, or to give thee the poison, if thou didst speak ?
He shunned the power of song.
Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin the lament.
But justice has overtaken all.
And I, shedding tears over this woe, bewail thy fate;
yet were I able, like 20 Orpheus, having gone down to Tartarus, like Ulysses once, or as Al­ cides in days of yore, I too would haply descend to the home of Pluto, that I might see thee, and, if thou singest to Pluto, that I might hear what thou singest.
Nay, but in the pre­ sence of the damsel (Proserpine) warble some Sicilian strain, sing some pleasant pastoral.
She too, being Sicilian, 21 sport - ed on the Ætnæan shores, and knew the Doric song:
nor will thy strain be unhonoured;
and as of old to Orpheus, sweetly singing to his lyre, she gave Eurydice to return, so will she send thee, Bion, to thy hills.
Yes, if even I could avail aught by singing to my pipe, I too would sing before Pluto.
My mother, why dost thou thus wound thy spirit, being sad beyond measure, and why is the former bloom no longer preserved on thy cheeks ?
Why, I pray thee, art thou vexed so much?
Is it in sooth because thine illustrious son suffers countless annoyances from 1 a man of no account, even as a lion from a fawn ?
Alas me I why then have the immortal gods thus so far dishonoured me ?
why then did my parents beget me to a fate thus adverse ?
Ill-fated am I, who, since I have come to the bed of a faultless hero, whom I did honour indeed like my own eyes, ay, even now both worship and reverence him in my heart.
But than him has no other of living beings been more ill-starred, or tasted so many cares in his own thoughts ;
wretched man, who with the 2bow and arrows, which Apollo himself had provided for him, dire weapons either of one of the Fates, or of Erinnys, 3 slew his own children, and robbed them of their dear life, as he raged about his house, and it was full of slaughter.
Them indeed I, wretched woman, beheld with mine own eyes, stricken by their father;
and this bath befallen no other even in a dream:
nor was I able to succour them, though they loudly called upon their mother;
for re­ sistless evil was nigh.
4
And even as a bird laments over her nestlings as they perish, which while still in infancy a fierce snake devours amid the thick bushes, while she, kind mother, hovers over them shrieking very shrilly, yet is not able, I ween, to succour her children ;
for in truth, she herself hath a great dread of coming nigher to the ruthless monster;
so I, most wretched mother, wailing for mine own offspring, with frantic feet kept running to and fro through my house fre­ quently.
Yes, and would that dying along with my children I too had lain low, having through my heart a poisonous arrow, thou, Artemis, mighty ruler to women, the gentler beings.
So, when they had mourned for us, would our parents with their own hands have placed us on a common pile with many funeral honours;
and having collected into one golden urn the bones of all, would have buried us, where we first were born.
But now they indeed inhabit horse-breeding Thebes, plough­ ing the deep rich 5 clods of the Aonian plain ;
but I at Tiryns, Juno's rocky city, wretched woman that I am, am ever in the same manner wounded at heart by many griefs;
and there is present to me no rest from tears.
But my husband indeed I behold with mine eyes only for a brief space in our house;
for a work is prepared for him of many labours, at which he toils, as he roams over land and sea, yes, for he has within his breast a strong heart of iron or stone;
6 but thou meltest away like water, weeping both at night, and as many days as come from Jove.
None other, however, of my kinsfolk can stand by and comfort me;
for it is not a wall between houses that shuts them in;
no!
but all dwell right beyond the 7piny Isthmus:
nor have I to whom, having looked, as an ill-fated woman, I could unfold my heart, except at least, 'tis true, my sister Pyrrha:
but she herself, too, is grieving more about her husband, thy son, 8 Iphiclus;
for most woeful children of all I deem that you have borne both to a god and a mortal man.
Thus in sooth spake she :
and 9the warmer tears poured the more down from her eyelids on her lovely bosom, as she called to mind her children, and her own parents afterwards.
And in like manner Alcmena was 10bedewing her white cheeks with tears;
and deeply while she groaned even from her heart, with wise words thus did she reply to her dear daughter-in-law:
11 Unhappy in thy children, why then, I pray, bath this fallen upon thy sharp thoughts ?
how is it that thou wishest to disturb us both, by speaking of our unceasing sorrows ?
for not now have they been wept for the first time.
Are not the woes enough, in which we are involved as they arise, ever and anon, each second day?
Yes, fond indeed of laments would be the man, who 12 would wish to add to the numbei of our woes.
Cheer up then!
such fate as this we have met by Heaven's behest;
and in truth I see thee, dear child, la­ bouring under unabating griefs:
yet I am ready to pardon your woe;
for in fact I suppose 13 even of joy there is satiety.
And I very exceedingly lament and pity thee, for that thou hast partaken of our dismal destiny, which also hangs heavily over our heads.
For be Proserpine and richly-robed Demeter witnesses, (by whom with great hurt to himself would any of our foes Swear wilfully a false oath,) that in mine heart I love thee not a whit less, than if thou hadst come from out my womb, and wert to me in mine house a 14late-born daughter:
nor do I imagine that, for thine own part, this at any rate altogether escapes thee.
Wherefore say not ever,15 my young shoot, that I care not for thee, not even if I wail more con­ stantly than fair-haired Niobe:
for 'tis no cause of blame for a mother to weep over an afflicted son:
since for ten months did I labour, before even I first beheld him, whilst I had him in my womb, and he brought me near to 16 Hell's gate-keeper Pluto;
so severe throes did I endure when about to travail hard with him.
But now my son is gone to accomplish a fresh toil on a foreign land, nor know I, ill-starred woman, whether I shall welcome him again having returned hither, or not.
And besides also a fearful dream has scared me during sweet sleep;
and I fear exceedingly, having seen a hurtful vision, lest it betide something untoward to my chil­ dren.
For my son, stout Hercules, seemed to me to hold in both his hands a well-made spade, with which he was delving, as one that had taken the work for hire, a dyke at the outskirt of some flourishing field, stripped, without cloak, and well­ girdled tunic:
but when he had arrived at the end of all the work, labouring at the strong fence of a levelled plot for vines, in truth, he was about, having placed his 17shovel upon the projecting raised bank, to put on the garments, in which he had been clad before;
when, on a sudden, above the deep trench there blazed up a fierce fire, and a vast flame was gathering round him:
but he kept ever drawing back with swift feet, desiring to escape the destructive weapon of He­ phaestus ;
and continually in front of his person he was brand­ ishing, as a 18 shield, his spade:
and with his eyes he kept looking around hither and thither, lest in truth the hostile fire should burn him.
High-souled Iphiclus, desiring, as me­ thought, to lend him help, tripped and fell upon the ground, ay, before he came up to him:
nor could he raise himself erect again, but lay 19 still, like a feeble old man, whom even against his will joyless age has forced to fall;
and there he lies fixedly on the ground, till some passer-by maintaining 20 ancient re­ verence for the hoary beard, has upraised him by the hand ;
so on the ground had spear-brandishing Iphiclus 21 fallen.
But as I beheld my two sons in sore distress, I did weep, till sound sleep at length was dispelled from mine eyes, and forth­ with bright dawn came.
Such dreams, dear one, have thoroughly affrighted my mind all night long :
22 but may they all turn from our house upon Eurystheus ;
and may my spirit become a prophet to him, nor fate accomplish otherwise aught else.
WHEN the breeze gently strikes the gray-green sea, 1 I am roused in my fearful mind, and no longer is land dear to me, 2 but the calm sea attaches me to it far more :
but whensoever the hoary deep has resounded, and the sea-water foams up 3 into an arch, and the waves rage afar, I look out for land and trees, and flee the brine :
and welcome to me is earth ;
then does the shady wood delight me, where though the wind should blow violently, 4 yet the pine tree sings.
Surely a hard life lives the fisherman, whose house is his bark, the sea his occupation, fish his slippery prey.
But sweet to me is sleep beneath a leafy plane, and I should love to hear the sound of the fountain hard by, which, as it babbles, delights, not alarms, the rustic.
PAN loved his neighbour Echo, and Echo was 6 enamoured of the frisky Satyr, while the Satyr was mad after Lyda :
as Echo Pan, so did the Satyr inflame Echo, and Lyda the Satyr :
and love was smouldering in each in their turns.
For as strongly as any one of them hated the lover, so strongly in like manner was he, loving, hated, and was suffer­ ing 1 a requital.
These lessons speak I to all them that love not, 2' Cherish them that love you, that if ye love, ye may be loved again.’3 ALPHEus, when he glides along the sea, past Pisa, comes to Arethusa, bringing his waters 4 laden with wild-olives, bearing as a dower fair leaves and flowers and sacred dust;
and he enters the waves deeply and runs in under the sea beneath, and water mingles not with waters ;
and the sea is not conscious of it, as the river passes through.
Love, knavish boy, plotter of ill, teacher of fearful things, has taught through his spell even a river to dive.
5 HAVING laid aside torch and bow, mischievous Eros took up an ox-goad, and he had a wallet slung-on-his-shoulders ;
and having joined under the yoke the toil-enduring necks of oxen, he sowed the furrow of Ceres, that it should bear grain.
And looking up he said to Jove himself, I‘ Make full the sown fields, lest I place thee, Europa's bull, under the plough.'2 WOULD that my sire had taught me to tend fleecy sheep, in which case, seated beneath the elms, or under the rocks, playing on my pipes, I would solace my cares with reeds.
Let us fly, ye Pierides :
seek we another well-built city for our country;
yet in sooth I will speak out to all, that ruinous drones have harmed the honey-bees.
SWEET is the music which the whispering pine Makes to the murmuring fountains;
sweet is thine, Breathed from the pipe:
the second prize thy due— To Pan, the horned ram;
to thee, the ewe;
And thine the yearling, when the ewe he takes-
A savoury mess the tender yearling makes.
Sweeter thy song than yonder gliding down
Of water from the rock's o'erhanging crown ;
If a ewe-sheep for fee the Muses gain, Thou, shepherd!
shalt a stall-fed lamb obtain ;
But if it rather please the tuneful Nine To take the lamb, the ewe shall then be thine.0 wilt thou, for the Nymphs’ sake, goatherd !
fill
Thy pipe with music on this sloping hill, Where grow the tamarisks ?
wilt sit, dear friend, And play for me, while I thy goats attend ?
We must not pipe at noon in any case;
For then Pan rests him, wearied from the chase.
Him, quick to wrath we fear, as us befits;
On his keen nostril sharp gall ever sits.
But thou-to thee the griefs of Daphnis known, And the first skill in pastoral song thine own-
Come to yon elm, into whose shelter deep Afront Priapus and the Naiads peep-
Where the thick oaks stand round the shepherd's seat
There, sitting with me in that cool retreat, If thou wilt sing, as when thou didst contest With Libyan Chromis which could sing the best, Thine, Thyrsis, this twin-bearing goat shall be, That fills two milk-pails thrice a-day for me ;
And this deep ivy-cup with sweetest wax Bedewed, twin-eared, that of the graver smacks.
Around its lips lush ivy twines on high, Sprinkled with drops of bright cassidony ;
And as the curling ivy spreads around, On every curl the saffron fruit is found.
With flowing robe and Lydian head-dress on, Within, a woman to the life is done-
An exquisite design ! on either side
Two men with flowing locks each other chide, By turns contending for the woman's love, But not a whit her mind their pleadings move.
One while she gives to this a glance and smile, And turns and smiles on that another while.
But neither any certain favour gains-
Only their eyes are swollen for their pains.
Hard by, a rugged rock and fisher old, Who drags a mighty net, and seems to hold, Preparing for the cast:
he stands to sight, A fisher putting forth his utmost might.
A youth's strength in the gray-head seems to dwell, So much the sinews of his neck outswell.
And near that old man with his sea-tanned hue, With purple'grapes a vineyard shines to view.
A little boy sits by the thorn-hedge trim, To watch the grapes-two foxes watching him:
One through the ranges of the vines proceeds, And on the hanging vintage slyly feeds ;
The other plots and vows his scrip to search, And for his breakfast leave him—in the lurch.
Meanwhile he twines and to a rush fits well A locust trap with stalks of asphodel;
And twines away with such absorbing glee, Of scrip or vines he never thinks-not be !
The juicy curled acanthus hovers round Th' Æoliancup-when seen a marvel found.
Hither a Calydonian skipper brought it, For a great cheese-cake and a goat I bought it;
Untouched by lip—this cup shall be thy hire, If thou wilt sing that song of sweet desire.
I envy not:
begin !
the strain outpour ;
'Twill not be thine on dim Oblivion's shore.
Begin, dear Muses !
the bucolic strain ;
For Thyrsis sings, your own Ætneän swain.
Where were ye, Nymphs !
when Daphnis pined away, Where through his Tempe Peneus loves to stray, Or Pindus lifts himself ?
Ye Were not here-
Where broad Anapus flows or Acis clear, Or where tall Ætna looks out on the main.
Begin, dear Muses !
the bucolic strain.
From out the mountain-lair the lions growled, Wailing his death-the wolves and jackals howledBegin, dear Muses !
the bucolic strain :
Around him in a long and mournful train, Sad-faced, a number of the horned kind, Heifers, bulls, cows, and calves, lamenting pined.
First Hermes from the mountain came and said, " Daphnis, by whom art thou disquieted ?
For whom dost thou endure so fierce a flame ?
"Then cowherds, goatherds, shepherds, thronging came, And asked what ailed him.
E'en Priapus went,
And said :
" Sad Daphnis, why this languishment ?
In every grove, by fountains, far and near, Thee the loved girl is seeking every where.
Ah, foolish lover !
to thyself unkind, Miscalled a cowherd, with a goatherd's mind !
The goatherd when he sees his goats at play, Envies their wanton sport and pines away.
And thou at sight of virgins, when they smile, Dost look with longing eyes and pine the while, Because with them the dance thou dost not lead.
"No word he answered, but his grief did feed, And brought to end his love, that held him fast, And only ended with his life at last.
Then Cypris came-the queen of soft desire, Smiling in secret, but pretending ire, And said :
"To conquer love did Daphnis boast, But, Daphnis ! is not love now uppermost ?"
Her answered he :
"
Thou cruel sorrow-feeder !
Curst Cypris !
mankind's hateful mischief-breeder !
'Tis plain my sun is set:
but I shall show The blight of love in Hades' house below.
‘Where Cypris kiss'd a cowherd’—men will speak— Hasten to Ida !
thine Anchises seek.
Around their hives swarmed bees are humming here, Here the low galingale—thick oaks are there.
Adonis, the fair youth, a shepherd too, Wounds hares, and doth all savage beasts pursue.
Go !
challenge Diomede to fight with thee­ 'I tame the cowherd Daphnis, fight with me.'"
Ye bears, who in the mountain hollows dwell, Ye tawny jackals, bounding wolves, farewell!
The cowherd Daphnis never more shall rove
In quest of you through thicket, wood, and grove.
Farewell, ye rivers, that your streams profuse From Thymbris pour ;
farewell, sweet Arethuse !
I drove my kine—a cowherd whilom here-
To pleasant pasture, and to water clear.
Pan !
Pan !
if seated on a jagged peak
Of tall Lycæus now ;
or thou dost seek
The heights of Mænalus—leave them awhile, And hasten to thy own Sicilian isle.
The tomb, which e'en the gods admire, leave now- Lycaon's tomb and Helice's tall brow.
Hasten, my king !
and take this pipe that clips, Uttering its honey breath, the player's lips.
For even now, dragged downward, must I go, By love dragged down to Hades' house below.
Now violets, ye thorns and brambles bear !
Narcissus now on junipers appear !
And on the pine-tree pears !
since Daphnis dies,
To their own use all things be contraries !
The stag trail hounds ;
in rivalry their song
The mountain owls with nightingales prolong !
"He said, and ceased:
and Cypris wished, indeed, To raise him up, but she could not succeed ;
His fate-allotted threads of life were spent, And Daphnis to the doleful river went.
The whirlpool gorged him—by the Nymphs not scorned,, Dear to the Muses, and by them adorned.
Cease!
cease, ye Muses!
the bucolic strain.
Give me the cup and goat that I may drain
The pure milk from her ;
and, for duty's sake, A due libation to the Muses make.
All hail, ye Muses !
hail, and favour me, And my hereafter song shall sweeter be.
Honey and honey-combs melt in thy mouth, And figs from Ægilus!
for thou, dear youth, The musical cicada dost excel.
Behold the cup !
how sweetly doth it smell ! '
Twill seem to thee as though the lovely Hours Had newly dipt it in their fountain-showers.
Hither, Cissætha !milk her !
yearling friskers, Forbear-behold the ram's huge beard and whiskers !
WHERE are the laurels ?
where the philters ?
roll
The finest purple wool around the bowl.
Quick !
Thestylis, that I with charms may bind
The man I love, but faithless and unkind.
This is the twelfth day he my sight hath fled, And knows not whether I be quick or dead;
The twelfth day since he cross'd my threshold o'er, Nor, cruel!
once hath knocked upon my door, In all that time.
His fancy, apt to change, Cypris and Love have elsewhere made to range.
I'll go-to see and chide him for my sorrow- To Timagetus' wrestling-school to-morrow.
Now will I charm him with the magic rite:
Come forth, thou Moon!
with thy propitious light;
Cold, silent goddess !
at this witching hour
To thee I'll chant, and to th' Infernal Power, Dread Hecate;
whom, coming through the mounds
Of blood-swoln corses, flee the trembling hounds.
Hail, Hecate !
prodigious demon, hail!
Come at the last, and make the work prevail;
That this strong brewage may perform its part
No worse than that was made by Circe's art, By bold Medea, terrible as fair, Or Perimeda of the golden hair.
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
First in the fire is burnt the barley meal;
Quick !
Thestylis, quick !
sprinkle more-yet more;
Wretch !
wither do thine idle fancies soar ?
Am I thy scorn and mock ?
sprinkle and say­ "
The bones of Delphis thus I shred away.
"Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
Delphis has made me fiercest tortures feel;
I burn the laurel over Delphis now:
As crackles loud the kindled laurel bough, Blazes, and e'en its dust we not discern-
So may the flesh of Delphis dropping burn !
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
As by the help divine, which I appeal, I melt this wax, may Myndian Delphis melt!
As whirls this wheel, may he, love's impulse felt, At my forsaken door be made to reel!
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
Bran now I offer:
thou, Queen Artemis !
Canst move aught firm, e'en Adamantine Dis.
Hark!
the dogs howl;
the goddess now doth pass
The cross-roads through:
ring, ring the sounding brass!
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
The sea is silent;
not a breath doth steal
Over the stillness;
but the troubled din Of passion is not hushed my heart within;
I burn for him, who hath defamed my life, Undone a virgin, made me not his wife.
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
Thrice the libation poured, I thrice unseal
My lips, August One !
thrice these words I speak ;
Whoever lies with Delphis, cheek by cheek, May he forget her so much as they say Theseus forgot, and left in Dia's bay The bright-haired Ariadne—fast away Sailing from Dia with his rapid keel.
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
A little herb in Arcady there grows, Which colts and mares doth strangely discompose, (Hence called Hippomanes) ;
for this they skurry O'er mountain-ranges with a frantic hurry:
Thus from the wrestling-school, all bright with oil, May Delphis madly rush-with thoughts that boil;
May he for me this maddening passion feel!
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
This fringe he dropt, that ran his cloak across, I tear, and to the furious fire I toss.
Ah, love!
ah, cruel love!
why dost outsuck
All of my blood, like marsh-leech firmly stuck ?
Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
A draught whose ill none antidote can heal From a bruised lizard I'll to-morrow make:
Now, Thestylis, this poisonous brewage take, And smear his threshold-there my mind must be, As thereto bound;
but he cares not for me:
And having smeared the door-way, spitting there, Then say, " The bones of Delphis thus I smear.
"Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel!
How, left alone, shall I with sorrow deal ?
Or where begin with my grief-plighted thought ?
Who first on me this love-this mischief brought ?
Anaxo came, on whom it fell this year
The basket to Diana's grove to bear:
She came for me and told me, in the show 'Mid many a beast a lioness would go.
Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend:
Theucharila, whose life did lately end, My Thracian nurse, now numbered with the blest, Came also to me, prayed me, strongly prest To go and look upon the splendid show.
At last I went—ah, doomed to bitter woe !
My linen tunic, never worn before, And Clearista's glistering robe I wore.
Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend:
Whilst I along the public road did wend, Midway by Lycon's house, I saw, alas !
Delphis and youthful Eudamippus pass.
The beards of both were of a yellower dye
Than the bright gold-bedropt cassidony.
Twain wrestlers, lately breathed, their breasts, bright Queen !
Outshone the sparkles of thy golden sheen.
Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend:
I saw, loved, maddened!
raging love did rend
My very soul;
my bloom of beauty bright Withered at once as by a sudden blight:
The pomp I saw not passing in my view, And how I reached my home I never knew ;
A fiery torment on my vitals fed;
Ten days and nights I lay upon my bed.
Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend:
Such hues and juices of the thapsus lend Gloomed on my cheek ;
off dropt my crown of hair;
I was but skin and bones;
in my despair Whom sought I not ?
what magic-dealing crone Consulted not ?
but I found help from none:
On hastened time, that brings all things to end.
Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend:
Then to my hand-maid I revealed my mind;
"
Some remedy for ray sore sickness find ;
I pine for, dote upon, the Myndian youth, Am altogether his in very sooth;
At Timagetus' school watch, bring him me, For there he visits-there he loves to be.
And when you see him from the rest apart, Then nod and softly whisper him, Sweetheart!
Simætha calls you’—guide him here, my friend.
"Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend:
She went and found the remedy I sought, And to my house the blooming Delphis brought.
But when I saw him o'er my threshold-sill Pass with light foot, I sudden grew more chill
Than wintry snow;
and from my forehead burst Sweat like the dew the melting South hath nurst;
I could not utter—e’en the murmur fine
That sleeping infants to their mothers whine;
Senseless I stiffened in my strange affright, Like a wax-doll, the girl-child's dear delight.
Whence grew my love, divinest Moon !
attend :
The heartless minion first on me did bend
His eager eyes, then sitting on the bed He turned them on the ground, and softly said :
—
“In calling me before I came self-moved, Thou hast as much outpast me, my beloved, As I did lately with swift foot out-pace The beautiful Philinus in the race."
-(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend:
) "
For, by sweet Eros !
with a second friend, Or with a third, I should have come to-night, Bringing sweet apples, crowned with poplar white, Careful the wreath with purple stripes to blend:
"(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend:
) "
Had you received me—well ;
for me, 'mid all, The handsome, active bachelor they call;
A kiss from those rich lips, that sweetly pout, Had been enough ;
but had you shut me out, And your barred doors had interposed delay, Axes and torches then had forced a way.
"
(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend:
)
“To Cypris first in gratitude I bend, Thou, next to her, hast snatched me from the fire, In calling me half burnt with fierce desire;
For Eros oft a fiercer flame awakes Than those Sicilian fires Hephæstus makes.
'(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend :
) "
He from her bed the virgin oft doth send, Stung by his furies ;
and the new-made bride Scares from the warm couch and her husband's side.
"These words he spoke;
but I with credulous mind Held his dear hand, and on the bed reclined :
Our bodies did by touching warmer grow, And on our cheeks there came a hotter glow :
Sweetly we whispered ;
and, in short, dear Moon !
By Eros fired, we gained Cythera's boon.
Nor any blame on me could Delphis lay, Nor haply I on him—’till yesterday.
I only learned to-day his yester ill:
While yet up-prancing the high eastern hill, Her fiery-footed steeds from ocean's dew With rosy-armed Aurora upward flew, There came the mother of the festive pair, Sweet-voiced Philista and Melixo fair, And told me :
—" Delphis loves elsewhere, I know, But whom I know not;
yet enamoured so, That from the banquet suddenly he fled, To hang his lady's house with flowers, he said."
My old friend told me this, and told me truth :
For twice or thrice a day once came my youth, And often left his Dorian pyx with me ;
This the twelfth day since him I last did see.
Has he forgot me for another love ?
With philters will I try his soul to move;
But if he still will grieve, betray me, mock, He shall, by fate!
the door of Hades knock.
That chest has drugs shall make him feel my rage ;
The art I learned from an Assyrian sage.
Thy steeds to ocean now, bright Queen, direct;
What I have sworn to do I will effect.
Farewell, clear Moon !
and skyey cressets bright, That follow the soft-gliding wheels of Night.
I GO to serenade my charming fair, Sweet Amaryllis;
Tityrus, to your care I leave my goats, that on the mountain feed ;
But of yon Libyan tawny ram take heed, Lest with his horn he butt you ;
careful tend, And to the fountain drive them, heart-dear friend !
Sweet Amaryllis!
why dost thou no more, Peeping from out thy cavern as before, Espy and call to thee thy little lover ?
Dost hate me ?
or do I myself discover Flat-nosed, or with a length of chin, when near ?
Thy scorn will make me hang myself, I swear.
Behold, ten apples, nymph !
I bring for thee, Plucked from the place where thou didst order me To pluck them;
others will I bring to-morrow.
Consider now my heart-devouring sorrow :
Oh !
that I were a little humming bee, To pass through fern and ivy in to thee, Where in thy cave thou dost thyself conceal!
I now know love-a grievous god to feel;
He surely sucked a savage lioness, Reared in the wild, who works me such distress, Eating into the marrow of the bone.
0 sweet in aspect!
altogether stone !
Nymph !
with thine eye-brows of a raven hue, Clasp me, that I may suck the honey-dew From off thy lip :
mere kisses yield some joy.
Now wilt thou make me the sweet crown destroy, This wreath of ivy which for thee I brought, With rose-buds and with parsley sweet inwrought.
Ah me !
what shall I do ?
I plead in vain-
Thou nearest not:
I'll plunge into the main, My jerkin stript, where Olpis sits on high, Watching the tunnies.
Should I even die, 'Twill please thee.
This the sign I lately found
For the struck pop-bell gave me back no sound, (When by that proof thy doubtful love I tried,) But withering on my elbow shrunk and dried.
Agræo, the diviner by the sieve, Forewarned me also what I now believe, (Binding the sheaves, the reapers followed she,) That I loved wholly one who loved not me.
A white twin-bearing goat, which the brunette, Old Memnon’s child, Erithacis, would get By wheedling from me, I have kept as thine ;
But since thou scornest me with airs so fine, It shall be hers.
A throbbing, I declare, In my right eye-shall I behold my fair ?
My ditty, leaning on this pine, I'll chant;
She'll haply look, since she's not adamant.
When in the race, mistrustful of his knees, To win the virgin ran Hippomenes ;
Three golden apples in his hand he took, And Atalanta could not help but look-
She saw, and maddened instant at the sight, And rushed into the gulf of love outright.
The seer Melampus from Mount Othrys drove
The stolen herd to Pylos.
Thence did Love His brother Bias crown-for in his arms Alphesibæa’s mother lodged her charms.
Did not Adonis, the fair shepherd youth, So madden Cypris that for very ruth, E'en when she had received his dying gasp, She could not bear to loose him from her clasp ?
Thrice blest, methinks, was that Endymion, Now laid asleep ;
thrice blest Iäsion, Who in his life did those sweet joys obtain, Of which ye must not, shall not hear, profane !
How my head aches !
my anguish doth not move thee ;
I'll sing no more, and since in vain I love thee, Here will I lie—me here the wolves shall eat;
'Twill be to thee like melting honey sweet.
WHOSE are these kine ?
Philondas's, my friend ?
No—Ægon’s,and he gave them me to tend.
Do you not milk them privily at eve ?
I could not the old man's quick eyes deceive ;
And her own calf he puts to every one.
But whither has the master cowherd gone ?
Have you not heard ?
with Ægon by his side, Milon has gone where Alpheus loves to glide.
When did e'er Ægon see th' Olympian oil ?
In strength for every feat of manly toil, They say he is a match for Hercules.
My mother said, believe her if you please, That I surpassed e'en Pollux.
Hence he hied, Taking a spade, and twenty sheep beside.
Nor needed much persuasion, I engage, Ægon to wrestle-and the wolf to rage.
His lowing heifers for their master pine.
They have a worthless keeper-wretched kine fPoor creatures !
they no longer wish to feed.
Here is a calf but skin and bones indeed-
Like a cicada, does she feed on dew ?
Not she, by Earth !
but whiles the fodder new Eats from my hand ;
or else with us she goes, Cropping the verdant bank, where Æsar flows ;
Or up Latymnus bounds away at will, Frisking along the thickly wooded hill.
How lean that red bull is !
just such another May Lampra have to offer to the mother Of Mars !
it is a tribe compact of ill.
Yet at the lake-mouth he doth take his fill, Browses on Physcus, or at times doth go Where the sweet waters of Neæthus flow ;
There the best herbs are freshened by the shower, Wild thyme, and fleabane, and the honey-flower.
Ah, wretched Ægon !
thy poor kine will die, Whilst thou dost aim at evil victory.
Even the pipe, which thou didst whilom make, Lying neglected, doth defilement take.
No !
by the Nymphs !
he gave it me the day
When he to glorious Pisa went away.
The songs of Pyrrhus and dear Glauca's lays I know to sing, and Croton love to praise.
Fair is Zacynthus ;
lovely ever shone
To the bright east up-heaved Lacinion, Where the bold boxer Ægon at a meal Ate eighty cakes ;
where from the mountain's heel He seized and dragged a proud bull by the hoof, And gave it Amaryllis ;
then aloof Shouted the women, and the cowherd smiledSweet Amaryllis !
though by death defiled, Thee shall I ne'er forget:
dear to my heart
As are my frisking goats, thou didst depart, To what a lot was I, unhappy, born !
Take heart;
there will be yet a brighter morn.
While there is life there's hope ;
the dead, I ween, Are hopeless.
One while Zeus shines out serene, Another while is hid in mist and shower.
I do take heart.
But see !
yon calves devour
The olive branches :
pelt them off, I pray ;
Confound the calves !
you white-skin thief, away!
Hist!
to the hill, Cymaetha !
don't you hear ?
If you don't get away, by Pan !
I swear I will so give it you !
now only look !
She comes again—I wish I had my crook !
Here, Corydon !
a thorn has wounded me-
How long and sharp these distaff-thistles be !
Confound the calf!
gaping at her I got
The wound :
under the ankle-see you not ?
Ay !
I have hold of it;
see !
here it is !
How small a wound tames man so tall as this !
Unshod you must not on the mountain go ;
For on the mountain thorns and prickles grow.
LACON my goat-skin filched ;
by timely flight Avoid, my goats!
the thievish Sybarite.
Lambs !
from the fountain, do you not perceive Conatas, who my pipe did lately thieve ?
What sort of pipe ?
when, slave of Sybaris !
Didst own a pipe ?
are you not fain to hiss
Still through a pipe of straw with Corydon ?
'Twas Lycon's gift, good freeman !
worthy one !
From you when and what sort of skin stole I ?
Your master has not one whereon to lie.
The gift of Crocylus, when late he gave The Nymphs a goat in sacrifice :
you, slave Did steal my spotted skin from envy sheer.
No !no !
by the shore-guarding Pan I swear-
Or from that rock into the waters deep
Of rapid Crathis may I madly leap !
Nor, by the Nymphs, the guardians of the lake, Did ever I the pipe of Lacon take-
So may the Nymphs look kindly to my weal.
If I believe you, be it mine to feel
The griefs of Daphnis !
will you stake a kid, (It is none enterprise to men forbid,) And I'll out-sing you, till you cry " Enough !
"Athene challenged by a sow of scruff!
Here is my kid, which, when you beat me, take !
A lamb, fat from the pasture, be your stake.
How is this fair ?
in this you are no fool;
'
Who ever thought of shearing hair for wool, Or passed a goat to milk a sorry bitch ?
Who has for conquest a prevailing itch, Like you conceited, is a wasp that rings
His buzzing horn when the cicada sings.
But since my kid seems insufficient stake, Behold this ram !
at once the song awake.
Softly !
you are not walking over fire:
Here you may sing whatever your muse inspire
More sweetly in this grove, beneath the shade
Of the wild olive ;
here a couch is laid
Of softest herbage ;
locusts babble here ;
Cool water flows a little onward there.
I'm cool-but feel annoyance at your daring
To look at me, yourself with me comparing, Who taught you when a boy.
What thanks one gains !
Rear a wolf-whelp-to rend you for your pains !
Envious and shameless babbler !
any thing Learnt, heard I from you worth remembering ?
Come hither, now, and learn from your defeat
No more with pastoral singers to compete.
Not thither—here are oaks and galingale ;
And round their hives the bees, soft-humming, sail;
Two springs of coolest water murmur near;
A deeper shade and singing birds are here;
And from aloft her nuts the pine-tree throws.
On fleece and lambskins here your may repose, Softer than sleep !
your goat-skins smell more ill— E'en than yourself.
I for the Nymphs will fill A bowl of white milk, of sweet oil an urn.
On flowering pennyroyal and soft fern
You here may tread ;
on skins of kids lie down Softer than lambskins.
I to Pan will crown Eight jars of white milk, and as many more
Of honeycombs with honey running o'er.
Each from his place pour out his rival strain ;
Keep to your oaks, and I will here remain.
But who shall judge between us ?
How I wish The herdsman, good Lycopas, with us-Pish!
I want him not:
but, if you please, we'll cry, And summon to us yonder man doth tieThe broom in bundles near you.
What dost say ?
"Tis Morson.
I'm agreed.
Then bawl away.
Ho !
Morson !
hasten hither, and decide
Which sings the best-a wager to be tried With you for judge :
only impartial be!
Now, by the Nymphs !
nor favour him nor me.
Thurian Sybartas owns the sheep in sight;
The goats Eumaras claims-the Sybarite.
You good-for-nothing babbler !
answer this,
Who asked you whose the sheep were, mine or his ?
I vaunt not, and I speak the simple truth ;
But you are very scurrilous, in sooth.
Sing-if you have a song :
don't kill with babble
Our friend here ;
by Apollo !
how you gabble !
Me more than Daphnis love the Muses true :
Two yearling kids to them I lately slew.
Apollo loves me much ;
for him I rear A goodly ram—his festival is near.
I milk my goats, twin-bearing all but twain :
A sweet girl cries, "
Why milk alone, fond swain ?
"Some twenty baskets Lacon fills with cheese, And gets him kisses wheresoe'er he please.
Me with sweet apples Clearista pelts, While round her lips a honey-murmur melts.
On me a blooming beauty fondly dotes, Round whose white neck the hair bright-shining floats.
With the screened garden-roses cannot vie
The common dog-rose, nor anemony.
The mountain-apples most delicious are-
Who crabbed beech-nuts would with them compare ?
I for my love will snare, and give to her A ring-dove brooding on a juniper.
Wool for a mantle will I give my dear, Soon as my sober-suited sheep I shear.
From the wild-olive, bleaters !
feed at will,
Where grow the tamarisks, on this sloping hill.
Off from that oak Cynætha and Conarus !
Feed eastward-yonder where you see Phalarus.
A cypress milk-pail for my girl I have, And bowl-which old Praxiteles did grave.
A hound, wolf-strangling keeper of the sheep, A faithful guardian, for my love I keep.
Locusts, that overleap my fences, spare My vines-their shoots yet weak and tender are.
Cicadæ !
see this goatherd I provoke :
So to their toil ye wake the reaping folk.
I hate the bush-tailed foxes—nightly troop, That Mycon's vineyard, grape-devouring, swoop.
I hate the scarabs-air-borne host, that mow Philonda's fig-trees, fig-devouring foe.
Do you remember when I smote you, fellow, How you did wriggle round the oak, and bellow ?
No !
but I do remember when with scourge Eumaras did your peccant humours purge.
Some one, my Morson, into rage is dashing ;
Go !
from the tomb pluck gray squills—for a lashing.
I too prick some one, Morson ;
do you take ?
Hasten to Hales ;
and for sowbread rake.
Flow Himera with milk, and Crathis flow Purple with wine !
and fruit on cresses grow!
Fountain of Sybaris, to honey turn,
And fill with honeycombs the maiden's urn !
On goat's-rue feed, my goats, and cytisus ;
On lentisk tread, and lie on arbutus !
Of the rose-eglantine there blooms a heap, And eke the honey-flower—to feed my sheep.
Alcippe for my ring-dove gave no kiss, Holding my ears—I love her not for this.
I love my love because a sweet lip paid With kisses for my pipe-the gift I made.
Nor whoop the swan, nor jay the nightingale May rival;
still you challenge, still to fail.
Cease, shepherd !
Morson gives the lamb to thee, Comatas ;
fail not to remember me, And let my portion of the flesh be nice, When to the Nymphs you make your sacrifice.
By Pan !
I'll send it.
Snort and gambol round.
My buck-goats all!
hark !
what a mighty sound I peal of ringing laughter at the cost Of Lacon, who to me his lamb has lost!
I too will skip.
My horned goats, good cheer!
To-morrow in the fountain, cool and clear, Of Sybaris I'll bathe you.
Hark!
I say, White butting ram!
be modest, till I pay The Nymphs my offering.
Ha !
then blows I'll try—
Or may I like the curst Melanthius die.
To the same field, Aratus, bard divine !
Once Daphnis and Damœtas drove their kine.
This on the chin a yellow beard did show:
On that the down had just begun to grow.
During the noontide of the summer heat, They by a fountain sung their ditties sweet.
But Daphnis first (to whom it did belong As challenger) began the pastoral song."
With apples Galatea pelts thy sheep, Inviting one, whose pulses never leap
To love, whilst thou, cold Polypheme !
dost pipe, Regardless of the sea-born beauty ripe.
And lo !
she pelts the watch-dog—with a bound
He barking starts, and angry looks around-
Then bays the sea ;
the waves soft-murmuring show An angry dog fast running to and fro.
Take heed he leap not on her, coming fresh
From the sea-wave, and tear her dainty flesh.
But like the thistle-down, when summer glows, The sportive nymph, soft moving, comes and goes;
Pursues who flies her, her pursuer flies, And moves the landmark of love's boundaries.
What is not lovely, lovely oft doth seem
To the bewildered lover, Polypheme."Preluding then, Damœtas thus began.“
I saw her pelt my flock, by mighty Pan !
Not unobserved by my dear single eye, Through which I see, and shall see till I die.
Prophet of ill!
let Telemus at home Keep for his own sons all his woes to come.
I, to provoke her, look not in return, And say that for another girl I burn..
At hearing which with envy, by Apollo !
The sea-nymph pines;
and her eye-quest doth follow, Leaping from out the sea like one that raves, Amid my flocks, and peeps into the caves.
I make the dog bark just to discompose her;
He, when I loved her, whining used to nose her.
Noting my action, she perchance will find Some messenger to let me know her mind.
I'll shut my door, till she on oath agree
To make her sweet bed on this isle with me.
Nor am I that unsightly one they say:
For in the calm, smooth wave the other day I saw myself:
and handsome was my beard, And bright, methought, my single eye appeared.
And from the beautiful sea-mirror shone
My white teeth, brighter than the Parian stone.
To screen myself from influence malign, Thrice on my breast I spat.
This lesson fine I learned from that wise crone Cotyttaris.
"This sung, Damœtas gave his friend a kiss.
Of pipe and flute their mutual gifts they made-
Daphnis the pipe, the flute Damœtas played.
Thereto the heifers frisked in gambols rude:
And neither conquered;
both were unsubdued.'
TWAS when Amyntas, Eucritus, and I, Did from the city to sweet Haleus hie;
The harvest-feast by that abounding river Was kept, in honour of the harvest-giver, By Phrasidamus and Antigenes, Sons of Lycopeus both, and good men these, If good there is from old and high descent, From Clytia and from Calchon, who, knee-bent Firmly against the rock, did make outflow The spring Burinna with a foot-struck blow, Near which a thickly wooded grove is seen, Poplars and elms, high overarching green.
Midway not reached, nor tomb of Brasilas, We chanced upon Cydonian Lycidas, By favour of the Muses :
who not knew That famous goatherd as he came in view ?
A tawny, shaggy goat-skin on his back,
That of the suppling pickle yet did smack ;
Bound by a belt of straw the traveller wore
An aged jerkin ;
in his hand he bore A crook of the wild olive coming nigh, With widely parted lips, and smiling eye-
The laughter on his lip was plain to see-
He quietly addressed himself to me:
"
Whither so fast at noon-tide, when no more
The crested larks their sunny paths explore, And in the thorn-hedge lizards lie asleep ?
To feast or to a wine-press do you leap ?
The stones ring to your buskins as you pass.
"To him I made reply—“ Dear Lycidas !
All say you are the piper-far the best 'Mid shepherds and the reapers;
this contest Gladdens my heart;
and yet (to put in speech My fancy) I expect your skill to reach.
Our way is to a harvest-feast, which cater Dear friends of ours for richly robed Damater, Offering their first-fruits—since their garner-floor Her bounteous love hath filled to running o'er.
Let us with pastoral song beguile the way ;
Common the path, and common is the day.
We shall each other, it may be, content;
For I, too, am a mouth-piece eloquent
Of the dear Muses ;
and all men esteem, And call me minstrel good-not that I deem, Not I, by Earth !
Philetas I surpass,
Nor the famed Samian bard, Sicelidas, A frog compared with locusts.
I beguile
The time with song."
He answered with a smile
“This crook I give thee—for thou art all over An imp of Zeus, a genuine truth-lover.
Who strives to build, the lowly plain upon, A mansion high as is Oromedon, I hate exceedingly;
and for that matter The muse-birds, who like cuckoos idly chatter Against the Chian minstrel, toil in vain:
Let us at once begin the pastoral strain ;
Here is a little song, which I did late, Musing along the highlands, meditate:
" To Mitylene sails my heart-dear love:
Safe be the way, and fair the voyage prove, E'en when the south the moist wave dashes high on The setting Kids, and tempest-veiled Orion Places his feet on ocean ;
and, returned, My love be kind to me by Cypris burned;
For hot love burns me :
may the Halcyons smooth
The swell o' the sea, the south and east winds soothe, That from the lowest deep the sea-weed stir- Best Halcyons !
whom of all the birds that skir
The waves for prey, the Nereids love the most.
Safe may my loved one reach the Lesbian coast, And on the way be wind and weather fair!
With dill or roses will I twine my hair, Or on my head will put a coronet, Wreathed with the fragrance of the violet.
I by the fire will quaff the Ptelean wine, And one shall roast me beans, while I recline Luxurious, lying on a fragrant heap
Of asphodel and parsley, elbow deep ;
And mindful of my love the goblet clip, Until the last lees trickle to my lip.
Two swains shall play the flute ;
and Tityrus sing How love for Xenea did our Daphnis sting, How on the mountain he was wont to stray, How wailed for him the oaks of Himera, When he, dissolving, passed away from us, Like snow on Hæmus, or far Caucasus, Athos or Rhodope :
or in his song Recite, how by his master's cruel wrong
The swain was in a cedar ark shut up, While quick-and how from many a flower-cup
The flat-nosed bees to his sweet prison flew, And there sustained him with the honey-dew, For that the Muse into his lip distilled Sweet nectar:
blest Comatas!
that fulfilled A whole spring, feeding on the bag o' the bee, Shut in an ark!
How had it gladdened me, (Would only thou wert of the living now !)
To tend thy goats along the mountain's brow, And hear thee sweetly sing, 0 bard divine !
Lying at leisure under oak or pine !
”He ceased:
I in my turn :
" Dear Lycidas !
Whilst on the highlands with my herd I pass, The Nymphs have taught me precious ditties oft, Which haply Fame has borne to Zeus aloft.
I choose for you the very best I know;
Now listen, since the Muses love you so:
"
The Loves, ill omen !
sneezed on me, who dote On lovely Myrtis, as on spring the goat.
Aratus, whom of men I love the best, Loves a sweet girl.
Aristis, minstrel blest, And worthiest man, whom his own tripod near Phœbus himself would not disdain to hear Sing to the harp, knows that Aratus feels
This scorching flame.
Pan !
whose rich music peals
On Homolus, place in his longing arms
Of her own will the blushing bloom of charms.
So may the youth of Arcady forbear With squills thy shoulders and thy side to tear, When fails the chase.
If thou wilt not, then weep, By nails all mangled, and on nettles sleep !
Where Hebrus flows, in frost-time of the year Dwell on the mountains 'neath the polar bear;
In summer with swart Æthiop, at the pile Of Blemyan rocks, beyond the springs of Nile !
Ye loves !
from Hyetis and Byblis flown, Who make Dione's lofty seat your own;
Ye loves !
that are to blushing apples like, The blooming Phyllis with your arrows strike-
Strike her, because she pities not my friend;
Though softer than a pear, her bloom shall end:
Ah, Phyllis !
Phyllis !
now the bachelors say, Behold thy flower of beauty drops away !
Let us, my friend Aratus !
pace no more, Nor keep our painful watch beside her door;
Let Chanticleer, that crows at dawn, behold Some other lover there benumbed with cold :
Such watch be Molon's, and be his alone ;
But rest be ours-and eke a friendly crone, Who may by spitting and by magic skill Quick disenchant us from foreshadowed ill.
"Ended my song, he, smiling as before, The friendly muse-gift gave-the crook he bore;
Then turning to the left pursued the way To Pyxa;
speeding, presently we lay, Where Phrasidamus dwelt, on loosened sheaves Of lentisk, and the vine's new-gathered leaves.
Near by, a fountain murmured from its bed, A cavern of the Nymphs :
elms overhead, And poplars rustled;
and the summer-keen Cicadæ sung aloft amid the green ;
Afar the tree-frog in the thorn-bush cried;
Nor larks nor goldfinches their song denied ;
The yellow bees around the fountains flew;
And the lone turtle-dove was, heard to coo:
Of golden summer all was redolent, And of brown autumn ;
boughs with damsons bent, We had ;
and pears were scattered at our feet, And by our side a heap of apples sweet.
A four-year cask was broached.
Ye Nymphs excelling Of Castaly, on high Parnassus dwelling, Did ever Chiron in the Centaur's cave Give draught so rich to Hercules the brave ?
Through Polypheme did such sweet nectar glance, That made the shepherd of Anapus dance, The huge rock-hurler—as the generous foam, Which, Nymphs, ye tempered at that harvest-home ?
0 be it mine again her feast to keep, And fix the fan in good Damater's heap ;
And may she sweetly smile, while spikes of corn And up-torn poppies either hand adorn !
MENALCAS met, while pasturing his sheep, The cowherd Daphnis on the highland steep ;
Both yellow-tressed, and in their life's fresh spring,— Both skilled to play the pipe, and both to sing.
Menalcas, with demeanour frank and free, Spoke first:
" Good Daphnis, will you sing with me ?
I can out-sing you, whensoe'er I try, Just as I please."
Then Daphnis made reply:
Shepherd and piper !
that may never be, Happen what will, as you on proof will see.
Ah, will you see it, and a wager make ?
I will to see this, and to pledge a stake.
And what the wager, worthy fame like ours ?
A calf my pledge, a full-grown lamb be yours.
At night my cross-grained sire and mother use
To count the sheep-that pledge I must refuse.
What shall it be then ?
What the victor's prize ?
I'll pledge a nine-toned pipe, that even lies
In the joined reeds, with whitest wax inlaid, The musical sweet pipe I lately made ;
This will I pledge-and not my father's things.
I, too, have got a pipe that nine-toned rings, Compact with white wax, even-jointed, new,- Made by myself:
a split reed sudden flew, And gashed this finger—it is painful still.
But who shall judge which has the better skill ?
Suppose we call that goatherd hither—see!
Yon white dog at his kids barks lustly.
He came when called ;
and, hearing their request
Was willing to decide which sung the best.
Clearly their rival tones responsive rung, Each in his turn, but first Menalcas sung.
Ye mountain-vales and rivers !
race divine !
If aught Menalcas ever sung was sweet, Feed ye these lambs ;
and feed no less his kine, When Daphnis drives them to this dear retreat.
Fountains and herbs, growth of the lively year !
If Daphnis sings like any nightingale, Fatten this herd ;
and if Menalcas here Conduct his flock, let not their pasture fail.
Pastures and spring, and milkful udders swelling, And fatness for the lambs, is every where At her approach :
but if the girl excelling Departs, both herbs and shepherd wither there.
The sheep and goats bear twins ;
the bees up-lay Full honey-stores, the spreading oaks are higher, Where Milto walks :
but if she goes away, The cowherd and his cows themselves are drier.
Uxorious ram, and flat-nosed kids, away For water to that wilderness of wood :
There, ram without a horn !
to Milto say, Proteus, a god too, fed the sea-calf brood.
Nor Pelops' realm be mine, nor piles of gold, Nor speed fleet as the wind ;
but at this rock
To sing, and clasp my darling, and behold
The seas blue reach, and many a pasturing flock.
To forest-beast the net, to bird the noose, Winter to trees, and drought to springs is bad ;
To man the sting of beauty.
Mighty Zeus!
Not only I—thou, too, art woman-mad.
Their sweet notes thus, in turn, they did prolong;
Menalcas then took up the closing song.
Spare, wolf !
my sheep and lambs ;
nor injure me, Because I many tend, though small I be.
Sleepest, Lampurus ?
up!
no dog should sleep
That with the shepherd-boy attends his sheep.
Be not to crop the tender herbage slow, Feed on, my sheep!
the grass again will grow.
Fill ye your udders, that your lambs may have
Their share of milk,—I some for cheese may save.
Then Daphnis next his tones preluding rung, Gave to the music voice, and sweetly sung.
As yesterday I drove my heifers by, A girl, me spying from a cavern nigh, Exclaimed, " How handsome !"
I my way pursued With down-cast eyes, nor made her answer rude.
Sweet is the breath of cows and calves-and sweet To bask by running stream in summer heat.
Acorns the oak;
and apples on the bough Adorn the apple-tree ;
her calf the cow;
His drove of kine, depasturing the field, His proper honour to the cowherd yield.
Th' admiring goatherd then his judgment spake:
Sweet is thy mouth, and sweetest tones awake From thy lips, Daphnis !
I would rather hear
Thee sing, than suck the honeycomb, I swear.
Take thou the pipe, for thine the winning song.
If thou wilt teach me here my goats among Some song, I will that hornless goat bestow, That ever fills the pail to overflow.
Glad Daphnis clapped his hands, and on the lawn
He leaped, as round her mother leaps the fawn.
But sad Menalcas fed a smouldering gloom, As grieves a girl betrothed to unknown groom.
And first in song was Daphnis from that time, And wived a Naiad in his blooming prime.
DAPHNIS !
begin the pastoral song for me;
Begin, and let Menalcas follow thee.
Meanwhile the calves the mother-cows put under, Let the bulls feed-but not roam far asunder, Scorning the herd-and crop the leafy spray ;
And leave the heifers to their frolic play.
Begin for me the sweet bucolic strain, And let Menalcas take it up again."
Sweet low the cow and calf-the tones are sweet, The pipe, the cowherd and myself repeat.
My couch is by cool water, and is strown
With skins of milk-white heifers ;
them threw down,
While they crept arbutus, the south-west wind From the bluff crag.
There stretched, no more I mind
The scorching summer than a loving pair Their parents sage, who bid them each ‘beware !
'"Thus Daphnis sweetly sung at my request;
Menalcas next his dulcet tones exprest."
Ætna !
my mother !
in the hollow rock
My pleasant mansion is;
I own a flock
Of many yearlings and of many sheep, Numerous as those the dreamer sees in sleep.
Fleeces are lying at my head and feet;
On an oak-fire are boiling entrails sweet;
And on my hearth in winter-time I burn Fagots of beech.
I have no more concern
For winter-than the toothless elder cares For walnuts, whose old dame his pap prepares.
"Both I applauded, and made gifts to both, A crook to Daphnis—the spontaneous growth Of my own father's field, yet turned so well, None could find fault with it;
a sounding shell I gave Menalcas;
four besides myself Fed on its flesh—I snared it from a shelf Amid th' Icarian rocks.
The conch he blew, And far abroad the blast resounding flew.
Hail, pastoral Muses !
and the song declare,
Which then I chanted for that friendly pair. “
On your tongue's tip may pustules never grow, For speaking falsely what for false you know !
Cicale the cicale loves;
and ant loves ant;
Hawk, hawk;
and me the muse and song enchant.
Of this my house be full!
nor sudden spring, Nor sleep is sweeter ;
nor to bees on wing
The bloom of flowers more dear delight diffuses, Than to myself the presence of the Muses.
On whomsoe'er they look and sweetly smile, Him Circe may not harm with cup or wile."
PLOUGHMAN, what is the matter with you, pray ?
You cannot draw the furrow straight to-day, Nor with your neighbour even do you keep, But lag behind like a thorn-wounded sheep.
If you cannot the furrow now devour, What will you be, my friend, at evening hour ?
You rock-chip, reaping till the sun's descent, Did you some absent darling ne'er lament ?
Never.
A labourer's heart with love-grief ache !
Did you ne'er chance for love to lie awake ?
No-never may I!
When a dog has eaten Meat for his master, the poor dog is beaten.
I'm deep in love-almost eleven days.
From a full wine-cask you your fancies raise;
I have not even vinegar enough.
Thence lie the sweepings of all sort of stuff
Before my door.
The child of Polybotas—the sweet singer, Who for the mowers at Hippocoon's chaunted.
Sinners heaven pricks—you have what long you wanted ;
A dry tree-frog will hug you close in bed.
None of your jibes :
care-breeding Love is said, And not old Plutus only, to be blind.
Don't talk too big.
I do not-only mind
To cut the corn down, and some love-song try About your girl;
you'll work more pleasantly :
And Battus once, at least, was musical.
To sing my charmer, slender, straight, and tall, Best Muses !
aid me ;
for, with skill divine, Ye, whatsoe'er ye please to touch, refine.
Lovely Bombyce!
though all men beside Call you a Syrian sun-embrowned, and dried, I call you a transparent sweet brunette.
The lettered hyacinth and violetAre dark;
yet these are chosen first of all For the sweet wreath and festive coronal.
The goat the cytisus, the wolf the goat, And cranes pursue the plough-on thee I dote.
Would that I had the wealth report bath told Belonged to Croesus !
wrought in purest gold, Statues of both of us should then be seen, Due dedications to the Cyprian Queen :
Thou with a flute, an apple, and a rose ;
I sandalled, in a robe that proudly flows.
Lovely Bombyce!
beautiful your feet, Twinkling like the quick dice;
your voice is sweet ;
But your sweet nature language cannot tell.
He privily hath learned to sing-how well!
But my poor chin in vain this great beard nurses;
List to a snatch or two of Lytierses.
Damater;
fruit-abounding !
grant this field
Be duly wrought, and rich abundance yield.
Bind without waste, sheaf-binder !
lest one say,
These men of fig-wood are not worth their pay.
Let the sheaf-hillock look to north or west;
The corn, so lying, fills and ripens best.
Ye threshers!
let not sleep steal on your eyes
At noon-for then the chaff most freely flies..
Up with the lark to reap, and cease as soon
As the lark sleeps-but rest yourself at noon.
Happy the frog's life !
none, his drink to pour, He looks for-he has plenty evermore.
Boil, niggard steward !
the lentil;
and take heed, Don't cut your hand-to split a cumin-seed.
Men toiling in the sun such songs befit;
Your puling love, poor rustic little-wit!
Is only fit—to whisper in her ears, When your old mother wakes as dawn appears.
NICIAS !
there is no remedy for love, Except the Muses;
this alone doth prove A sweet and gentle solace for the mind Of love-sick man—not easy though to find.
Full knowledge of this truth I deem is thine, Physician, and beloved of all the Nine !
Thus, Polypheme of yore, our Cyclops, found
The power of song on love's uneasy wound ;
With the first down that budding youth discloses
On cheek and chin, he doted-not with roses
And apples for his love, and the trim curl
To please her eye, but with delirious whirl, Neglecting all things else.
Oft to the stall
His sheep from pasture came without his call, While he from dawn mid sea-weeds and the spray Of Galatea sung, and pined away, By mighty Cypris wounded at the heart, Who in his liver fixed her cruel dart.
He found the cure while from the cliff he flung
His glances seaward, and his ditty sung :
—"
Why, Galatea, scorn for love dost render ?
Whiter than fresh curds, than the lamb more tender;
More skittish than the calf, more clearly bright
Than unripe grape transparent in the light !
Here dost thou show thyself when sleeps thy lover, Still flying ever as my sleep is over, E'en as the sheep, the gray wolf seeing, flees.
I loved when with my mother from the seas
Thou first didst come, and seek the mountain-side To gather hyacinths—and I thy guide.
Since then I never yet have ceased to love thee, Although my passion never yet did move thee..
I know the reason why the beauty flies—
One shaggy eye-brow on my forehead lies
Over one eye, stretched out from tip to tip
Of either ear, and overhangs my lip A nostril broad.
Such as I am, I keep, Drinking their best of milk, a thousand sheep;
My cheeses fail not in their hurdled row In depth of winter nor in summer's glow.
No Cyclops here can breathe the pipe like me, Who sing, when I should sleep, myself and thee, Sweet-apple !
I for thee four bear-whelps rear, And eke eleven fawns that collars wear.
Come live (thou shalt not fare the worse) with me, And to its murmurs leave that azure sea.
Thy nights will sweeter pass within my cave, Where the tall cypress and the laurel wave ;
The sweet-fruit vine and ivy dark are there ;
From the white snow its waters cool and clear Thick-wooded AEtna sends :
whom would it please
In sea to dwell, when land has joys like these ?
Though rough I seem in Galatea's eyes, My wealth of oak a constant fire supplies ;
O fire of love !
I could be well content
That life and precious eye at once were brent.
Had I but fins !
then would I dive and kiss
Thy dainty hand, though daintier lip I miss ;
In different seasons take thee different flowers, The summer lily white in summer hours, And while it winter was, what winter bred, The tender poppy with its pop-bells red.
From some sea-ranger I will learn to swim, To see what charms you in your ocean dim.
Come, Galatea !
sparkling from the foam, And then, like me, forget to turn thee home.
Would that the shepherd and his life could please-
To milk my ewes, with runnet fix the cheese.
My mother is in fault, and only she—
She never spake a friendly word for me ;
Although she sees me pining fast away, Thinner and thinner still from day to day.
I'll tell her that my feet and temples throb, That she, as I have done, with grief may sob.
O Cyclops !
Cyclops !
whither dost thou hover ?
To weave thy baskets would more wit'discover, And get thy lambs green leaves.
Milk the near ewe ;
Why one that faster flies in vain pursue ?
A fairer Galatea you may find;
Others are fair, and all are not unkind:
For many a damsel, when eve's shadow falls, Me to sport with her fondly, sweetly calls ;
And all of them, with eyes that brightly glisten, Giggle most merrily, whene'er I listen:
That I am somebody on earth is plain.
"Thus Polypheme with song relieved love's pain
And from his ails himself did safer free, Than had he given a leech a golden fee.
ART come, dear youth ?
Two days and nights away I For love who passion, wax old-in a day.
As much as apples sweet the damson crude Excel;
the bloomy spring the winter rude;
In fleece the sheep her lamb;
the maid in sweetness
The thrice-wed dame;
the fawn the calf in fleetness;
The nightingale in song all feathered kind-
So much thy longed-for presence cheers my mind.
To thee I hasten, as to shady beech
The traveller, when from the heaven's reach
The sun fierce blazes.
May our love be strong, To all hereafter times the theme of song ! "
Two men each other loved to that degree, That either friend did in the other see A dearer than himself.
They lived of old, Both golden natures in an age of gold."O father Zeus!
ageless Immortals all!
Two hundred ages hence may one recall, Down-coming to the irremeable river, This to my mind, and this good news deliver:
" E'en now from east to west, from north to south, Your mutual friendship lives in every mouth."
This, as they please, the Olympians will decide:
Of thee, by blooming virtue beautified, My glowing song shall only truth disclose ;
With falsehood's pustules I'll not shame my nose.
If thou dost sometime grieve me, sweet the pleasure
Of reconcilement, joy in double measure To find thou never didst intend the pain, And feel myself from all doubt free again.
And, ye Megarians, at Nisæa dwelling, Expert at rowing, mariners excelling, Be happy ever!
for with honours due Th' Athenian Diodes, to friendship true, Ye celebrate.
With the first blush of spring
The youth surround his tomb:
there who shall bring
The sweetest kiss, whose lip is purest found, Back to his mother goes with garlands crowned.
Nice touch the arbiter must have, indeed,
And must, methinks, the blue-eyed Ganymede Invoke with many prayers-a mouth to own True to the touch of lips, as Lydian stone To proof of gold,-which test will instant show The pure or base, as money-changers know.
FRIEND!
not for us alone was love designed, Whoe'er his parent of immortal kind ;
Nor first to us fair seemeth fair to be, Who mortal are, nor can the morrow see.
But e'en Amphitryon's brazen-hearted son, Who stood the lion's rage, did dote upon
The curled and lovely Hylas—made his joy To train him as a father would his boy, And taught him all whereby himself became A minstrel-praised inheritor of fame ;
Nor left him when the sun was in mid-air, Or Morn to Jove's court drove her milk-white pair;
Or when the twittering chickens were betaking Themselves to rest, her wings their mother shaking, Perched on the smoky beam;
that, trained to go In the right track, he might a true man grow.
When Jason sailed to find the golden fleece, And in his train the choicest youth of Greece;
Then with the worthies from the cities round, Came Hercules, for patient toil renowned, And Hylas with him:
from Iölcos they, In the good Argo ploughed the watery way.
Touched not the ship the dark Cyanean rocks,
That justled evermore with crashing shocks, But bounded through, and shot the swell o' the flood, Like to an eagle, and in Phasis stood:
Thence either ridgy rock in station lies.
But at what times the Pleiades arise:
When to the lamb the borders of the field (The spring to summer turning) herbage yield ;
The flower of heroes minded then their sailing ;
And the third day, a steady south prevailing, They reached the Hellespont;
and in the bay Of long Propontis hollow Argo lay :
Their oxen for Cianians dwelling there The ploughshare in the broadening furrow wear.
They land at eve ;
in pairs their mess they keep ;
And many strow a high and rushy heap:
A meadow broad convenient lay thereby, With various rushes prankt abundantly.
And gold-tressed Hylas is for water gone For Hercules and sturdy Telamon, Who messmates were:
a brazen urn he bore, And soon perceived a fountain straight before.
It was a gentle slope, round which was seen A multitude of rushes, parsley green, And the close couch-grass, creeping to entwine Green maiden-hair, and pale-blue celandine.
Their choir the wakeful Nymphs, the rustics' dread, In the mid sparkle of the fountain led ;
Malis, and young Nychea looking spring, And fresh Eunica.
There the youth did bring,
And o'er the water hold his goodly urn, Eager at once to dip it and return.
The Nymphs all clasped his hand;
for love seized all, Love for the Argive boy ;
and he did fall Plumping at once into the water dark, As when a meteor glides with many a spark Plumping from out the heavens into the seas-
And then some sailor cries, " A jolly breeze, Up with the sail, boys !"
Him upon their knees
The Nymphs soft held;
him dropping many a tear With soft enticing words they tried to cheer.
Anxious Alcides lingered not to go, Armed like a Scythian with his curved bow.
He grasped his club ;
and thrice he threw around
His deep, deep voice at highest pitch of sound;
Thrice called on Hylas ;
thrice did Hylas hear, And from the fount a thin voice murmured near ;
Though very near, it very far appeared :
As when a lion, awful with his beard, Hearing afar the whining of a fawn, Speeds to his banquet from the mountain-lawn ;
In such wise.
Hercules, the boy regretting, Off at full speed through pathless brakes was setting.
Who love, much suffer :
what fatigue he bore!
What thickets pierced !
what mountains clambered o'er i What then to him was Jason's enterprise ?
With sails aloft the ship all ready lies;
Midnight they sweep the decks and oft repeat, " Where, where is Hercules ?"
Where'er his feet Convey him, there the frantic mourner hurries, For a fierce god his liver tears and worries.
Fair Hylas thus is numbered with the blest:
Their friend, as ship-deserter, all the rest Reproach ;
while trudges be (and sad his case is) To Colchos and inhospitable Phasis.
Health to Thyonichus!
The same to you.
How late you are!
Late ?
what concernment new ?
It is not well with me.
And therefore lean, With beard untrimmed and dry straight hair you're seen.
But lately one, in seeming much the same, Who called himself Athenian, hither came, A barefoot, pale Pythagorean oaf, In love, methought, and longing-for a loaf.
You'll have your jest:
Cynisca flouts me so, That I shall madden unawares, I know-
There's but a hair's-breadth now 'twixt me and madness.
Extreme in changes ever-brooding sadness, Or moody violence-as the whim makes you Sport of the time:
but what new care o'ertakes you ?
The Argive, I, and the Thessalian knight Good Apis, and Cleunicus, brave in fight, Were drinking at my farm.
We had for fare
Two pullets and a sucking pig;
and rare Rich Biblian wine (near four years old) I drew, And fragrant still, as from the wine-press new.
A Colchian onion gave the brewage zest;
As mirth with drink advanced, we thought it best To quaff the wine's pure juice, each to his flame, And every one was bound to tell her name.
So said, so done:
we drank to them we loved:
But she, my she !
by all my love unmoved, Said nothing, though I then and there named her.
Think what a tempest did my temper stir!
“Won’t speak?" I said :
"or, as the wise man spoke, Hast seen a wolf ? " another said in joke.
From her red burning face (it kindled so) You might have lit a lamp.
Lycus, you know, Is name for wolf;
and there is such an one, Tall, delicate, my neighbour Laba's son ;
And many think him handsome :
for this youth, And his fine love my damsel pined in sooth.
I heard a whisper, nor I sifted it, Having a man's beard without manly wit.
But Apis—we were at our cups again-
Sang out “ My Lycus !" a Thessalian strain.
Then sudden into tears Cynisca burst-
The girl of six years for the breast that nurst
Her tender infancy, not so much weeps.
You know me, how no bound my temper keeps ;
With doubled fist once and again I struck Both of her cheeks.
She thereat did up-tuck
Her skirts and quickly bolted through the door.
Do I not please thee ?
hast a paramour
Nearer thy heart ?
plague o' my life !
go, go !
Hug him for whom your tears, like beads, thick flow.
As for her callow brood, that nested lies
Under the roof, the swallow swiftly flies
To bring them food, and flies for more again :
From her soft couch more swift she fled amain, Through hall, court, gate, as fast as she was able:
" The bull into the wood," as runs the fable.
Add two to this, the eight and fiftieth day, 'Twill be two full months since she went away;
And since we parted, as a sign of woe, My hair has, Thracian-like, been left to grow.
But only Lycus is her sole delight;
For him her door is open e'en at night.
But hapless I, with the Megarian lot, Am held in none account, and quite forgot.
All would be well, could I my love restrain ;
But mice, they say, the taste of pitch retain.
I cannot cure myself, however I try ;
For hapless love I know no remedy;
Except that Simus sailed across the water, When smitten with old Epichalcus' daughter, And came back whole.
I too will cross the wave, Nor best nor worst of soldiers, but a brave.
May all be as you wish, my Æschines !
But if you will depart beyond the seas, Gladly king Ptolemy brave hearts engages, Best man of all that gives the soldier wages.
What sort of man is he in other things ?
To brave and noble souls the best of kings ;
Has a discerning spirit;
takes delight
In all the Muses ;
courteous to the height;
Who loves him and who loves him not, he knows ;
And many gifts on many men bestows.
When asked a boon, he king-like not denies ;
But oft to ask is neither right nor wise.
Then if you wish a martial cloak to fold Around your shoulders, and in station bold, Firm on both feet, abide the shielded foe On-rushing-instantly to Egypt go.
Soon we grow old, and Time steals on apace, Whitening the hair, and withering the face.
We ought to do what us behoves, I ween, While yet our knee is firm, our strength is greenIs Praxinoa at home ?
Dear Gorgo, yes !
How late you are !
I wonder, I confess,
That you are come e'en now.
Quick, brazen-front!
[To EUNOA.
A chair there-stupid !
lay a cushion on't.
Thank you, 'tis very well.
Be seated, pray.
My untamed soul!
what dangers on the way !
I scarce could get alive here :
such a crowd !
So many soldiers with their trappings proud !
A weary way it is—you live so far.
The man, whose wits with sense are aye at war, Bought at the world's end but to vex my soul
This dwelling-no !
this serpent's lurking-hole, That we might not be neighbours :
plague o' my life, His only joy is quarrelling and strife.
Talk not of Dinon so before the boy ;
See !
how he looks at you !
My honey-joy!
My pretty dear !
'tis not papa I mean.
Handsome papa!
the urchin, by the Queen, Knows every word you say.
The other day-
For this in sooth of every thing we say-
The mighty man of inches went and brought me Salt-which for nitre and ceruse he bought me.
And so my Diocleide—a brother wit, A money-waster, lately thought it fit To give seven goodly drachms for fleeces five—
Mere rottenness, but dog's hair, as I live, The plucking of old scrips-a work to make.
But come, your cloak and gold-claspt kirtle take, And let us speed to Ptolemy's rich hall, To see the fine Adonian festival.
The queen will make the show most grand, I hear.
All things most rich in rich men's halls appear.
To those who have not seen it, one can tell
What one has seen.
'Tis time to go—'tis well For those who all the year have holidays.
Eunoa !
my cloak—you wanton !
quickly raise,
And place it near me—cats would softly sleep ;
And haste for water-how the jade does creep !
The water first—now, did you ever see ?
She brings the cloak first:
well, then, give it me.
You wasteful slut, not too much-pour the water !
What!
have you wet my kirtle !
sorrow's daughter ?
Stop, now:
I'm washed-gods love me :
where's the key
Of the great chest ?
be quick, and bring it me.
The gold-claspt and full-skirted gown you wear Becomes you vastly.
May I ask, my dear, How much in all it cost you from the loom ?
Don't mention it:
I'm sure I did consume More than two mince on it:
and I held on The work with heart and soul.
But when done, well done!
Truly—you're right.
My parasol and cloak- Arrange it nicely.
Cry until you choke, I will not take you, child;
horse bites, you know- Boo !
Boo !
no use to have you lame.
Let's go.
Play with the little man, my Phrygian !
call
The hound in ;
lock the street-door of the hall.
Gods, what a crowd :
they swarm like ants, how ever
Shall we work through them with our best endeavour ?
From when thy sire was numbered with the blest, Many fine things, and this among the rest, Hast thou done, Ptolemy !
No villain walks
The street, and picks your pocket, as he talks
On some pretence with you, in Egypt's fashion :
As once complete in every style, mood, passion, Resembling one another, rogues in grain, Would mock and pilfer, and then -mock again.
What will become of us, dear Gorge ?
see !
The king's war-horses !
Pray, don't trample me, Good sir !
the bay-horse rears !
how fierce a one !
Eunoa, stand from him:
dog-heart!
won't you run ?
He'll kill his leader !
what a thought of joy,
That safe at home remains my precious boy !
Courage !
they're as they were-and we behind them.
I nearly lost my senses ;
now I find them, And am myself again.
Two things I hold In mortal dread-a horse and serpent cold, And have done from a child.
Let us keep moving ;
0 !
what a crowd is on us, bustling, shoving.
(To an old woman.)
Good mother, from the palace ?
Yes, my dear.
Is it an easy thing to get in there ?
Th'
Achæans got to Troy, there's no denying ;
All things are done, as they did that-by tryingThe old dame spoke oracles.
Our sex, as you know, Know all things—e'en how Zeus espoused his Juno.
Praxinoa!
what a crowd about the gates !
Immense !
your hand;
and, Eunoa, hold your mate's ;
Do you keep close, I say, to Eutychis, And close to us, for fear the way you miss.
Let us, together all, the entrance gain :
Ah me !
my summer-cloak is rent in twain.
Pray, spare my cloak, heaven bless you, gentleman !
'Tis not with me—I will do what I can.
The crowd, like pigs, are thrusting.
Cheer thy heart, 'Tis well with us.
And for your friendly part, This year and ever be it well with you !
A kind and tender man as e'er I knew.
See !
how our Eunoa is prest—push through-
Well done !
all in-as the gay bridegroom cried, And turned the key upon himself and bride.
What rich, rare tapestry !
Look, and you'll swear
The fingers of the goddesses were here.
August Athene !
who such work could do ?
Who spun the tissue, who the figures drew ?
How life-like are they, and they seem to move !
True living shapes they are, and not inwove !
How wise is man !
and there he lies outspread
In all his beauty on his silver bed, Thrice-loved Adonis !
in his youth's fresh glow, Loved even where the rueful stream doth flow.
Cease ye like turtles idly thus to babble :
They'll torture all of us with brogue and gabble.
Who's you ?
what's it to you our tongues we use ?
Rule your own roost, not dames of Syracuse.
And this too know we were in times foregone Corinthians, sir, as was Bellerophon.
We speak the good old Greek of Pelop's isle :
Dorians, I guess, may Dorian talk the while.
Nymph !
grant we be at none but one man's pleasure ;
A rush for you—don't wipe my empty measure.
Praxinoa, hush !
behold the Argive's daughter, The girl who sings as though the Muses taught her, That won the prize for singing Sperchis' ditty, Prepares to chaunt Adonis;
something pretty I'm sure she'll sing :
with motion, voice, and eye, She now preludes-how sweetly, gracefully !
Of Eryx, Golgos, and Idalia, Queen !
My mistress, sporting in thy golden sheen, Bright Aphrodite !
as the month comes on Of every year, from dureful Acheron What an Adonis-from the gloomy shore
The tender-footed Hours to thee restore !
Hours, slowest of the Blest!
yet ever dear,
That wished-for come, and still some blessing bear.
Cypris!
Dione's daughter !
thou through portal
Of death, 'tis said, hast mortal made immortal, Sweet Berenice, dropping, ever blest!
Ambrosial dew into her lovely breast.
Wherefore her daughter, Helen-like in beauty, Arsinöe thy love repays with duty ;
For thine Adonis fairest show ordains, Bright Queen, of many names and many fanes !
All seasonable fruits ;
in silver cases
His gardens sweet;
and alabaster vases Of Syrian perfumes near his couch are laid ;
Cakes, which with flowers and wheat the women made ;
The shapes of all that creep, or take the wing, With oil or honey wrought, they hither bring ;
Here are green shades, with anise shaded more ;
And the young Loves him ever hover o'er, As the young nightingales, from branch to branch, Hover and try their wings, before they launch Themselves in the broad Air.
But, 0!
the sight
Of gold and ebony ! of ivory white Behold the pair of eagles!
up they move With his cup-bearer for Saturnian Jove.
And see yon couch with softest purple spread, Softer than sleep, the Samian born and bred Will own, and e'en Miletus:
that pavilion Queen Cypris has-the nearer one her minion, The rosy-armed Adonis;
whose youth bears
The bloom of eighteen or of nineteen years ;
Nor pricks the kiss-the red lip of the boy ;
Having her spouse, let Cypris now enjoy.
Him will we, ere the dew of dawn is o'er, Bear to the waves that foam upon the shore ;
Then with bare bosoms and dishevelled hair, Begin to chant the wild and mournful air.
Of all the demigods, they say, but one Duly revisits Earth and Acheron—
Thou, dear Adonis !
Agamemnon's might, Nor Aias, raging like one mad in fight;
Nor true Patroclus ;
nor his mother's boast, Hector, of twenty sons famed, honoured most;
Nor Pyrrhus, victor from the Trojan siege-
Not one of them enjoyed this privilege ;
Nor the Deucalions ;
nor Lapithae ;
Argive Pelasgi ;
nor Pelopidæ.
Now, dear Adonis, fill thyself with glee, And still returning, still propitious be.
Praxinoa, did ever mortal ear A sweeter song from sweeter minstrel hear ?
O happy girl !
to know so many things-
Thrice happy girl, that so divinely sings !
But now 'tis time for home :
let us be hasting ;
My man's mere vinegar, and most when fasting:
Nor has he broken yet his fast to-day ;
When he's a-hungered, come not in his way.
Farewell, beloved Adonis !
joy to see !
When come, well come to those who welcome thee.
JOVE'S daughters hymn the gods;
and bards rehearse
The deeds of worthies in their glowing verse.
The heaven-born Muses hymn the heavenly ring;
Of mortals, then, let mortal poets sing.
Yet who-as many as there be that live Under the grey dawn, will a welcome give To our sweet Graces, or the door-latch lift, Or will not send them off without a gift ?
Barefoot, with wrinkled brows, and mien deject, They chide me for the way of chill neglect;
Though loath, into their empty chest they drop,
And on cold knees their heavy heads they prop ;
And dry their seat is, when no good they earn, But from a fruitless journey back return.
What living man the poet will repay With generous love for his ennobling lay ?
I know not:
men no longer, as before, Would live for good deeds in poetic lore;
But are overcome by detestable gain ;
Close-fisted, every one doth fast retain
His money, thinking how to make it grow, Nor freely would the smallest mite bestow;
But says :
" the knee is nearer than the shin ;
Some good be mine !
from gods bards honour win.
But who will hear another ?
one will do-- Homer, best poet, and the cheapest too--
He costs me nothing."
Fools !
what boots the gold
Hid within doors in heaps cannot be told ?
Not so the truly wise their wealth employ:
With some 'tis fit one's natural man to joy ;
Some to the bard should freely be assigned, To kin—and many others of mankind.
The gods their offerings ;
guests should have their dues, Welcome to come and go whene'er they choose.
But most of all the generous mind prefers
The Muses' consecrate interpreters.
So may you live to fame, when life is done, Nor mourn inglorious at cold Acheron, Like one from birth to poverty betrayed, Whose palms are horny from the painful spade.
To many a serf Antiochus the great, To many king Aleuas in his state, Measured the monthly dole.
Much kine to see Lowed at the full stalls of the Scopadæ.
Innumerous flocks to some cool green retreat
The shepherds drove, to screen them from the heat, O'er Cranon's plain-choice flocks in choicest place, The wealth of Creon's hospitable race.
No pleasure had been theirs these things about, When once their sweet souls they had emptied out Into the broad raft of drear Acheron ;
But they, sad with the thoughts of life foregone, Had lain-their treasures left and memory hid—
Long ages lain the wretched dead amid, Had not the glorious Ceian breathed the fire
Of his quick spirit to the stringed lyre, And would not let them altogether die, But made them famous to posterity :
And e'en their swift-foot steeds obtained renown, Which in the sacred race-course won the crown.
Who would have known the noble Lycian pair-
The sons of Priam with their pomp of hair-
Or Cycnus, as a woman fair to ken, Had no bard sung the wars of former men ?
Nor that Odysseus, who went wandering round, Twice sixty moons, wherever man is found, And, while alive, to farthest Hades sped, And from the cavern of the Cyclops fled, Had been aye famed;
the keeper of the swine, Eumæus, and the man the herded kine Had in his watchful care, Philœtius, And e'en Laertes the magnanimous, Had been in a perpetual silence pent, But for that old Ionian eloquent.
The Muses best renown on men bestow:
The living waste the wealth of those below.
It were all one the waves to number o'er, As many as wind and blue sea drive ashore, Or wash with water from the spring's dark urn
The clay of unbaked brick, as try to turn
The money-lover from his wretched pelf-
But let us leave the miser to himself.
May countless pieces swell his silver store !
And let him ever have a wish for more !
But may I still prefer bright honour's meed, And man's good will, to many a mule and steed!
I am in quest of one whose willing mind I may, by favour of the Muses, find.
Without the Jove-born sisters, harsh and hard Are all approaches found by every bard.
Not weary yet revolving heaven appears
Of bringing round the months and circling years.
The car shall yet be moved by many a steed;
And me shall some one as a minstrel need ;
Than him more deeds heroic never wrought Achilles, or stout Alas, when they fought, Where in his tomb the Phrygian Ilus lies, On the broad plain of mournful Simoeis.
Who, where the sun sets, dwell-on Libya's heel, The bold Phœnicians shuddering terror feel ;
For Syracuse against them takes the field, Each with his ready spear and willow shield.
Amidst them arms heroic Hieron, Equal to heroes of the times foregone ;
Floats o'er his helm, in wavy darkness loose, His horse-hair crest—Athene !
mightiest Zeus !
And thou, who with thy mother reignest queen O'er Ephyra the wealthy, where is seen Lysimeleia's water, may the blow Of harsh Necessity rebuke the foe, And scatter them from our sweet island back O'er the Sardonian ocean's yeasty track ;
And out of many, few return to tell Their wives and children how the perished fell!
In the foe-ruined cities of the plain Soon may their former dwellers live again, And till the fruitful fields !
unnumbered sheep.
And fat, bleat cheerily !
the cattle creep Herded in safety to the wonted stalls, Warning the traveller that evening falls !
For sowing-time be wrought the fallow lea, When the cicada, sitting on his tree, Watches the shepherds in the open day, And blithely sings, perched on the topmost spray ;
O'er martial arms may spiders draw their train, And of fierce war not e'en the name remain ;
And famous Hieron illustrious be, By poets hymned, beyond the Scythian sea ;
Or where Semiramis her station chose, And her huge walls, asphaltos-built, arose !I am but one:
but many others are Dear to the Muses-may it be their care To praise the warrior-king (as poets use), And people, and Sicilian Arethuse !
Ye goddesses !
whose loving favours wait On that Orchomenos, the Thebans' hate, No where unbidden, but to court or hall Bidden, with you will I attend the call, Through your dear presence confident to please, Enchanting daughters of Eteocles !
What good, what fair can men without you see ?
Oh !
may I ever with the Graces be !MusES !
begin and end the song with Zeus,
When of immortals we the chief extol:
Of men the name of Ptolemy produce First, last, and midst-for he is chief of all.
For their exploits the seed heroical
Of demigods life-giving minstrels found :
I, skilled to sing, will Ptolemy install Theme of my song-and glowing hymns redound E'en to their praise, who dwell th' Olympian heights around.
In Ida's thick of wood, perplexed with choice, Which to begin with, the wood-cutter flings
His glance around :
to what shall I give voice
First out of all the many blessed things,
With which the gods have graced the best of kings ?
How great the son of Lagus from his birth !
Born for what deeds !
what great imaginings
His mind conceived beyond the sons of earth !
Up to the gods by Zeus exalted for his worth !
In Jove's own house his golden couch is spread, And by him sits his friend in royal pride, Great Alexander, the portentous dread Of Persians glittering with the turban pied :
And Hercules, the vast Centauricide, Sits opposite on adamantine throne ;
There with the gods he banquets gratified, In his sons' sons rejoicing as his own, Made free of age by Zeus, and as immortals known.
For from heroic Hercules the twain Descended :
therefore when he goes content From the gods'.
banquet to his wife again, Sated with nectar of a fragrant scent, To one his quiver and his bow unbent Ever he hands, and to that other blest
His iron-shotted club, with knobs besprent ;
And so they marshal him unto his rest
In his ambrosial home, white-ankled Hebe's nest.
How excellent of dames was Berenice !
To her dear parents what a wealth of pleasure !
Dionis wiped her fingers on the spicy Swell of her bosom.
No man in such measure E'er loved his wife, as Ptolemy's best leisure Doted on her ;
and she with him contended
In love—yea !
loved him more :
his house and treasure
Thus to his sons he with full trust commended, Since, loving, he the couch of loving wife ascended.
Some stranger draws the wanton's fancy flighty—
Her children many, like the father none !
Loveliest of goddesses !
bright Aphrodite !
Through thee, the way of wailful Acheron Was ne'er by lovely Berenice gone :
Her, thy sweet care, from the Cyanean river, And death's grim ferryman, the gloomy one !
Thou didst, soft-placing in thy fane, deliver, And a conceded share of thine own honours give her.
Soft loves on mortal kind she breathes benign, And makes his love-care light to every lover.
Thou, who in Argos didst with Tydeus twine, Dark brows thy gentle eye-lids arching over, Didst Diomede to light of day discover ;
To Peleus the full-bosomed Thetis bore Achilles;
thee, (for there the birth-pang drove her The aid of Eileithuia to implore,) Bright Berenice brought forth on the Coan shore:
The Woman-helper stood benignant by, Her limbs from pain composing, till she smiled On thee new-born to warrior Ptolemy—
And like his father was the lovely child.
Exulting Cos, with jubilant rapture wild, Fondled the babe, loud-hymning at the sight:
— " Boy !
be thou blest;
for me be honours piled
On thy account, such as the Delian bright Hung round the blue-crowned isle, on which he sprung to light.
“From thee to Triop's hill such honour follow, And no less to the Dorians dwelling nigh, As his Rhenæa had from King Apollo ! " Thus Cos:
the bird of Zeus, up-poised on high, Under the clouds, well-omened thrice did cry:
From king-protecting Zeus the sign was sent;
But when from birth he marks a royalty, That king surpassingly is excellent For wealth, wide rule by sea and o'er much continent.
In many a region many a tribe doth till
The fields, made fruitful by the shower of Zeus ;
None like low-lying Egypt doth fulfil Hope of increase, when Nile the clod doth loose, O'er-bubbling the wet soil:
no land doth use
So many workmen of all sorts, enrolled In cities of such multitude profuse, More than three myriads, as a single fold Under the watchful sway of Ptolemy the bold.
Part of Phoenicia ;
some Arabian lands ;
Some Syrian ;
tribes of swart Æthiopes ;
All the Pamphylians, Lycians he commands, And warlike Carians ;
o'er the Cyclades His empire spreads ;
his navies sweep the seas ;
Ocean and rivers, earth within her bounds Obeys him :
and a host of chivalries, And shielded infantry, with martial sounds
Of their far-glittering brass, the warrior-king surrounds,His wealth, that daily flows from every side, The treasure of all other kings outweighs ;
His busy people's days in quiet glide:
The monster-breeding Nile no hostile blaze Doth overpass, the war-shout there to raise.
Nor hath armed foeman from swift ship outleapt
To seize the kine Egyptian pastures graze ;
For o'er the broad lands of that happy sept
The bright-haired Ptolemy strict ward hath ever kept.
His whole inheritance he cares to keep, As a good king :
himself hath garnered more:
Nor useless in his house the golden heap, Increased like that of ants;
for of his store
The gods have much, since them he doth adore Ever with first-fruits, and his love commends
With other gifts ;
his bounty ne'er is poor;
To noble-minded princes much he sends, ,And gives to cities much, and much to worthy friends.
None in the sacred games e'er took a part, Skilled the melodious song to modulate, Without a royal recompense of art:
Whence Ptolemy the muse-priests celebrate For his munificence.
What meed more great
Than good renown can wealthy man befall ?
This meed doth on the dead Atridæ wait;
Their infinite spoil from Priam's ravaged hall
In the thick gloom lies hid, from whence is no recall.
Only this prince hath in his fathers' ways Exactly walked, and doth their stamp retain ;
Whence he to both his parents loved to raise Temples, and placed their statues in each fane, Of gold and ivory-never sought in vain By prayer of mortals;
on their altars red Fat thighs of oxen burn the royal twain, Himself and consort-one more furnished With love and excellence ne'er clasped her spouse in bed.
Such were the nuptials of the royal pair, Whom Rhea bore, the royalties divine Of blest Olympus :
Iris spread with care, Iris the virgin yet, whose fingers shine With fragrant brightness, when they would recline The marriage couch.
Hail, Ptolemy ! to thee And other demigods I will assign Due praise.
One word for after-men ;
to me
It seems, whatever good there is, from Zeus must be.
TWELVE Spartan virgins, the Laconian bloom, Choired before their Helen's bridal room, New hung with tapestry :
entwined the fair With hyacinths their hyacinthine hair ;
When Menelaus, Atreus' younger pride, Locked in sweet Tyndaris, his lovely bride ;
To the same time with cadence true they beat
The rapid round of intertwining feet;
One measure tript, one song together sung-
Their hymenæan all the palace rung.
So early, bridegroom !
fix'd in slumber deep ?
So heavy-limbed, with such a love for sleep ?
Thyself, wine-heavy, on the bed hast thrown
For only rest ?
thou shouldst have slept alone, And with her mother left the girl to play With only girls until the break of day.
She's thine from day to day, and year to year-
Thrice-happy bridegroom !
on thy way 'tis clear Good demon sneezed, that only thou shouldst gain
The prize so many princes would obtain, Only of demigods, whose bosomed love Her husband makes the son-in-law of Jove !
Jove's daughter, peerless beauty-bud of Greece, Now lies with thee beneath one broidered fleece.
What offspring to thy hopes will she prefer-
Could her dear offspring but resemble her !
Where flows Eurotas in his pleasant place, Thrice eighty virgins, we pursued the race, Like men, anointed with the glistering oil, A bloom of maiden buds—love's blushing spoil:
Of equal years ;
but, seen by Helen's side, Not one in whom some blemish was not spied.
As rising Morn, oh, venerable Night !
Shows from thy bosom dark her face of light ;
As the clear spring, when winter's gloom is gone, So mid our throng the golden Helen shone.
As of a field or garden ornament, The lofty cypress shoots up eminent;
As of the chariot the Thessalian steed, So rosy Helen of the Spartan breed Is ornament and grace.
Like Helen none Draws the fine thread around the spindle spun,
And in the ready basket piles so much ;
None interlaces with so quick a touch
The woof and warp ;
for other never came A web so perfect from the broidering frame.
Like Helen none the cithern knows to ring, Of Artemis or tall Athene sing, Like Helen, in whose liquid-shining eyes Desire, the light of love, dissolving lies.
O fair and lovely girl!
a matron now-
Where meadow-flowers in dewy brightness grow, We'll hie with early dawn, and fondly pull Sweets to twine garlands for our beautiful ;
Remembering Helen with our fond regrets, As for the absent ewe her suckling frets.
Of lotuses we'll hang thee many a wreath Upon the shady plane, and drop beneath Oil from the silver pyx ;
and on the bark, In Doric, shall be graved for all to mark, “To me pay honour—I am Helen's tree."
Hail, bride !
high-wedded bridegroom, hail to thee!
Fruitful Latona fruit of marriage give ;
Cypris in bonds of mutual love to live;
And Zeus the wealth that shall without an end From high-born sire to high-born son descend!
Sleep, happy pair !
in love enjoy your rest, Breathing desire into each other's breast.
But wake at dawn ;
for we'll present us here
At the first call of crested chanticleer.
Hymen, 0 Hymenaean !
joyful spread
With love's contentment sweet this marriage-bed.
As from a hive the thieving Eros drew A honey-comb, a bee his finger stung ;
Then in his anguish on his hand he blew, Stamped, jumped-and then to Cytherea sprung;
Showed her the wound, and cried:
" A thing how wee, How great a wound makes with its little sting ! "
His mother smiled:
“Art thou not like a bee, Such great wounds making-such a little thing ?
”EUNICA, smiling with a bitter scoff, When I would sweetly kiss her, bade me " off !
Fool cowherd !
would you kiss me ?
not to kiss Rude clowns, but city lips, I've learnt, I wis.
You never, man !
shall kiss my lovely mouth-
Not in a dream.
You are—O how uncouth !
Your look offends me, and your speech provokes;
Your play is horse-play ;
vulgar are your jokes.
How smooth in speech !
how delicate an air !
How soft your beard !
how odorous your hair !
Your lips are sickly ;
and your hands are black, And you smell rank:
don't foul me;
back, clown, back!
Thrice on her breast she spat, these hard words saying, Me scornfully from head to foot surveying;
Pouting and muttering proudly looked askaunt, Before mine eyes did plume her form and flaunt, And mocking smiled with lips drawn far apart.
My blood boiled fiercely from my grief of heart, And red my cheeks from passionate anguish grew, As vernal roses from the morning dew.
She left me then :
but angry feelings glow Within my heart, because she used me so.
Am I not handsome, shepherds ?
tell me truly;
Or has some god transformed my person newly ?
For as lush ivy clips the stem o' the tree, The bloom of beauty lately covered me.
My curls, like parsley, round my temples clung ;
A shining forehead my dark brows o'erhung;
My eyes were bluer than Athene's own ;
My mouth than new cheese sweeter ;
every tone Sweeter than honeycombs:
and sweet I take My song to be;
the sweetest sounds I wake From all wind instruments, in very deed-
Straight pipe or transverse, flute or vocal reed.
The girls upon the hills me handsome call;
They kiss me lovingly-they love me all.
But ah !
my city-madam never kist me ;
And for I am a cowherd she dismist me.
That Dionysus in the valleys green Once tended kine, she never heard, I ween ;
Nor knows that Cypris on a cowherd doted, And on the Phrygian hills herself devoted To tend his herd;
nor how the same Dionis In thickets kist, in thickets wept Adonis.
Who was Endymion ?
him tending kine Stooped down to kiss Selena the divine, Who from Olympus to the Latmian grove Glided to slumber with her mortal love.
Didst thou not, Rhea, for a cowherd weep ?
And didst thou not, high Zeus !
the heaven sweep, In form of winged bird, and watch indeed To carry off the cowherd Ganymede ?
Only Eunica (daintier she must be Than were Selena, Cypris, Cybele,) Won't kiss a cowherd.
May'st thou ne'er uncover Thyself, self-worshipt Beauty!
to a lover
In town or country ;
but, vain poppet!
ever Sleep by thyself-despite thy best endeavour.
THE nurse of industry and arts is want;
Care breaks the labourer's sleep, my Diophant!
And should sweet slumber o'er his eyelids creep, Dark cares stand over him, and startle sleep.
Two fishers old lay in their wattled shed, Close to the wicker on one sea-moss bed;
Near them the tools wherewith they plied their craft, The basket, rush-trap, line, and reedy shaft, Weed-tangled baits, a drag-net with its drops, Hooks, cord, two oars, an old boat fixt on props.
Their rush-mat, clothes, and caps, propt either head;
These were their implements by which they fed, And this was all their wealth.
They were not richer
By so much as a pipkin or a pitcher.
All else seemed vanity:
they could not mend
Their poverty-which was their only friend.
They had no neighbours ;
but upon the shore
The sea soft murmured at their cottage door.
The chariot of the moon was midway only, When thoughts of toil awoke those fishers lonely:
And shaking sleep off they began to sing.
The summer-nights are short, when Zeus the king Makes the days long, some say-and lie.
This night I've seen a world of dreams, nor yet 'tis light.
What's all this ?
am I wrong ?
or say I truly ?
And can we have a long, long night in July?
Do you the summer blame ?
The seasons change, Nor willingly transgress their wonted range.
From care, that frightens sleep, much longer seems
The weary night.
Can you interpret dreams ?
I've seen a bright one, which I will declare, That you my visions, as my toil, may share.
To whom should you in mother-wit defer ?
And quick wit is best dream-interpreter.
We've leisure, and to spare:
what can one do, Lying awake on leaves, as I and you, Without a lamp ?
they say the town-hall ever Has burning lights—its booty fails it never.
Well:
let us have your vision of the night.
When yester-eve I slept, outwearied quite With the sea-toil, not over-fed, for our Commons, you know, were short at feeding hour, I saw myself upon a rock, where I Sat watching for the fish—so eagerly !
And from the reed the tripping bait did shake, Till a fat fellow took it-no mistake :
('Twas natural-like that I should dream of fish, As hounds of meat upon a greasy dish :
)
He hugged the hook, and then his blood did flow;
His plunges bent my reed like any bow ;
I stretched both arms, and had a pretty bout, To take with hook so weak a fish so stout.
I gently warned him of the wound he bore ;
" Ha !
will you prick me ?
you'll be pricked much more.”
But when he struggled not, I drew him in;
The contest then I saw myself did win.
I landed him, a fish compact of gold !
But then a sudden fear my mind did hold, Lest king Poseidon made it his delight, Or it was Amphitrite's favourite.
I loosed him gently from the hook, for fear
It from his mouth some precious gold might tear, And with my line I safely towed him home, And swore that I on sea no more would roam, But ever after would remain on land, And there my gold, like any king, command.
At this I woke;
your wits, good friend, awaken, For much I fear to break the oath I've taken.
Fear not:
you swore not, saw not with your eyes
The fish you saw ;
for visions all are lies.
But now no longer slumber :
up, awake !
And for a false a real vision take.
Hunt for the foodful fish that is, not seems ;
For fear you starve amid your golden dreams.
THE twins of Leda, child of Thestius, Twice and again we celebrate in song, The Spartan pair, stamped by Ægiochus, Castor and Pollux, arming with the thong His dreadful hands ;
both merciful as strong Saviours of men on danger's extreme edge, And steeds tost in the battle's bloody throng, And star-defying ships on ruin's ledge, Swept with their crews by blasts into the cruel dredge.
The winds, where'er they list, the huge wave drive, Dashing from prow or stern into the hold ;
Both sides, sail, tackle, yard, and mast, they rive, Snapping at random:
from Night's sudden fold Rushes a flood;
hither and thither rolled, Broad ocean's heaving volumes roar and hiss, Smitten by blasts and the hail-volley cold:
The lost ship and her crew your task it is, Bright pair !
to rescue from the terrible abyss.
They think to die—but lo!
a sudden lull 0' the winds ;
the clouds disperse;
and the hush'd sheen
Of the calmed ocean sparkles beautiful:
The Bears, and Asses with the Stall between, Foreshow a voyage safe and skies serene.
Blest Brothers !
who to mortals safety bring, Both harpers, minstrels, knights, and warriors keen:
Since both I hymn, with which immortal king Shall I commence my song ? of Pollux first I'll sing.
The justling rocks, the dangerous Euxine's mouth, Snow-veiled, when Argo safely passed, and ended Her course at the Bebrycian shore, the youth Born of the gods from both her sides descended, And on the deep shore, from rude winds defended, Their couches spread ;
and strook the seeds of fire From the pyreion.
Forthwith unattended Did Pollux, of the red-brown hue, retire With Castor, whose renown for horsemanship was higher.
L'On a high hill a forest did appear:
The brothers found there a perennial spring, Under a smooth rock, filled with water clear, With pebbles paved, which from below did fling A crystal sheen like silver glistering :
The poplar, plane, tall pine, and cypress, grew Hard by :
and odorous flowers did thither bring
Thick swarm of bees, their sweet toil to pursue, As many as in the meads, when spring ends, bloom to view.
There lay at ease a bulky insolent, Grim-looked :
his ears by gauntlets scored and marred ;
His vast chest, like a ball, was prominent;
His back was broad with flesh like iron hard, Like anvil-wrought Colossus to regard ;
And under either shoulder thews were seen
On his strong arms, like round stones which, oft jarred
In the quick rush with many a bound between, A winter torrent rolls down through the cleft ravine.
A lion's hide suspended by the feet Hung from his neck and o'er his shoulders fell:
Him the prize-winner Pollux first did greet:
" Hail, stranger!
in these parts what people dwell ? " "
The hail of utter stranger sounds not well, At least to me."
“We're not malevolent, Nor sons of such, take heart."
“You need not tell Me that—I in myself am confident." "
You are a savage, quick to wrath and insolent.""
You see me as I am ;
upon your land I do not walk." " Come thither, and return With hospitable gifts." " I've none at hand For you, nor want I yours."
“Pray, let me learn, Wilt let me drink from out this fountain urn ?" " You'll know, if your thirst-hanging lips are dry." " How may we coax you from your humour stern, With silver or what else ?" " The combat try—” " How, pray, with gauntlets, foot to foot and eye to eye ?""
In pugilistic fight, nor spare your skill." - "
Who is my gauntlet-armed antagonist ? " "
At hand !
he's here ;
you see him if you will, I, Amycus, the famous pugilist." "
And what the prize of the victorious fist ? " " The vanquished shall become the victor's thrall." " Red-crested cocks so fight, and so desist." " Cock-like or lion-like the combat call;
This is the prize for which we fight, or none at all.
"Then on a conch he blew a mighty blast:
The long-haired Bebryces, hearing the sound, Under the shady planes assembled fast;
And likewise Castor, in the fight renowned, Hastened and called his comrades to the ground, From the Magnesian ship.
With gauntlets both Armed their strong hands ;
their wrists and arms they bound
With the long thongs;
with one another wroth, Each breathing blood and death, they stood up nothing loth.
First'each contended which should get the sun
Of his antagonist;
but much in sleight
That huge man, Pollux!
was by thee outdone;
And Amycus was dazzled with the light;
But raging rushed straight forward to the fight, Aiming fierce blows ;
but wary Pollux met him, Striking the chin of his vast opposite, Who fiercer battled, for the blow did fret him, And leaning forward tried unto the ground to get him.
Shouted the Bebryces ;
and, for they feared
The man like Tityus might their friend down-weigh In the scant place, the heroes Pollux cheered:
But shifting here and there Jove's son made play, And struck out right and left, but kept away From the fierce rush of Neptune's son uncouth, Who, drunk with blows, reeled in the hot affray, Out-spitting purple blood;
the princely youth Shouted, when they beheld his battered jaws and mouth.
His eyes were nearly closed from the contusion
Of his swoln face ;
the prince amazed him more With many feints, and seeing his confusion, Mid-front he struck a heavy blow and sore, And to the bone his forehead gashing tore;
Instant he fell, and at his length he lay
On the green leaves ;
but fiercely as before, On his uprising, they renewed the fray, Aiming terrific blows, as with intent to slay.
But the Bebrycian champion strove to place His blows upon the broad breast of his foe, Who ceaselessly disfigured all his face:
His flesh with sweating shrunk, that he did show, From huge, but small;
but larger seemed to grow The limbs of Pollux, and of fresher hue The more he toiled:
Muse !
for 'tis thine to know, And mine to give interpretation true.
Tell how the son of Zeus that mighty bulk o’verthrew.
Aiming at something great, the big Bebrycian
The left of Pollux with his left hand caught, Obliquely leaning out from his position, And from his flank his huge right hand he brought, And had he hit him would have surely wrought Pollux much damage;
but escape he found, Stooping his head, and smote him, quick as thought, On the left temple;
from the gaping wound A bubbling gush of gore out-spurted on the ground.
Right on his mouth his left hand then he dashed;
Rattled his teeth ;
and with a quicker hail
Of blows he smote him, till his cheeks he smashed:
Stretched out he lay;
his senses all did fail, Save that he owned the other did prevail
By holding up his hands:
nor thou didst claim
The forfeit, Pollux, taking of him bail Of a great oath in his own father's name, Strangers to harm no more with word or deed of shame.
To Castor now belongs my votive strain, The brass-mailed, shake-spear knight.
The twins of Zeus, It chanced, had carried off the daughters twain Of old Leucippus;
wroth for which abuse, The two bold brothers, sons of Aphareus, Pursued the ravishers incontinent-
Their plighted bridegrooms, Idas and Lynceus.
They overtook them at the monument
Of the dead Aphareus, as on their way they went.
With shields and spears all from their chariots leapt, And Lynceus through his helmet loudly spoke:
" Why not let brides be by their bridegrooms kept ?
Why with your drawn swords, ready for the stroke, Do you so eagerly the fight provoke ?
To us their sire betrothed them, and did swear
An oath thereto-which oath he only broke Persuaded by your gifts, (foul shame to hear In case of others' brides,) kine, mules, and divers gear."
Oft have I said, although no speechifier, Before you both ;
my friends !
it is not right Princes for wives those maidens should desire, Whose bridegrooms wait them and the nuptial night;
Sparta, sweet Arcady with fleeces white, Equestrian Elis, famous Argolis, The Achæan towns, Messenia's ample site, And all the shore-reach of rich Sisyphis, Are all of great extent with choice of maids, I wis."
And you may pick and choose at will of these, Who are in mind, form, feature, excellent;
Good men for sons-in-law most fathers please, And you 'mid heroes are pre-eminent, On either side ennobled by descent.
Come, let our nuptials to their end proceed ;
We'll find brides for you to your heart's content:
The wind to wave swept off my useless rede ;
might as well have preached unto the winds indeed."
You are ungentle in your wilful mood ;
Be now persuaded for your own behoof;
Though we are cousins-if it seems you good
This strife to finish by the battle-proof, Let Idas and brave Pollux stand aloof, While Castor and myself, the younger, try The battle;
thus to the parental roof
We shall not leave an utter misery-
One death is quite enough for one sad family."
Those who survive shall gladden all their friends, (Bridegrooms, not corses,) and these virgins wed:
Good is small ill that great contention ends."
And Providence fulfilled the words he said.
That elder pair their arms deposited;
But Lynceus shook, under his shield's broad rest, His quivering lance, and Castor likewise sped To meet him :
to the conflict fierce they prest;
On either martial head nodded the horse-hair crest.
First with their spears they aimed full many a blow, Where'er an exposed part came into sight, But ere they injured one another so, The spear-heads broke in either broad shield pight:
Then from the sheaths they drew their swords outright, And fiercely on the other either prest, Nor paused a moment in the furious fight;
And each at shield or helm their blows addrest, 3ut quick-eyed Lynceus maimed-only the purple crest.
At Castor's left knee then he fiercely strook, Who, 'scaping, smote the threatening hand away;
He, running, to his father's tomb betook Himself, dropping the hand :
there Idas lay Watching the cousins ply the bloody fray;
But eager Castor drove his thirsty sword Through flank and navel;
out-gushed to the day His bowels, where out-spread he lay begored ;
And down his eyelids dim the heavy sleep was poured.
Nor was it fated that his mother dear
Should see the other wed to her content;
For Idas at that hapless sight did tear A pillar from his father's monument, To slay his brother's slayer;
but Zeus sent, In aid of Castor, his devouring fire, Made drop the marble, and himself up'-brent.
So they did to none easy task aspire, Who fought those mighty ones-the sons of mighty sire.
Hail, sons of Leda !
give my hymns renown :
To you and Helen, dear the minstrel's claim, And dear to all who threw proud Ilion down.
The Chian minstrel, princes!
gave you fame, Of Troy, th' Achæan ships that thither came, The war, and the war's tower, Achilles brave, Hymning the song :
may mine be free from blame!
I give you what to me the Muses gave;
And gods prefer the song to all the gifts they have!
A YOUTH was love-sick for a maid unkind, Whose form was blameless, but not so her mind.
She scorned her lover and his suit disdained;
One gentle thought she never entertained.
She knew not Love-what sort of god, what darts
From what a bow he shoots at youthful hearts !
Her lips were strangers to soft gentleness, And she was difficult of all access.
She had no word to soothe his scorching fire, No sparkle of the lip ;
no moist desire To her bright eyes a dewy lustre lent;
Blushed on her cheek no crimson of consent;
She breathed no word of sighing born-no kiss
That lightens love, and turns its pain to bliss.
But, as the wild game from his thicket spies
The train of hunters with suspicious eyes, So she her lover ;
ever did she turn Toward him scornful lip, and eye-glance stern.
She was his fate:
and on her glooming face, The scorn that burned within her left its trace.
Her colour fled;
and every feature showed Pale from the rage that in her bosom glowed.
Yet even so she was - how fair to see!
The more she scorned him, still the more loved he.
At last by Cypris scorched without her cure, He could no more the raging flame endure.
He went and kist her door, and tears he shed, And, 'midst his tears and kisses, sadly said:
­" Harsh, cruel girl!
stone-heart and pitiless!
The nurseling of some savage lioness, Unworthy love!
my latest gift I bring,
This noose-no more will I thine anger sting.
But now I go where thou hast sentenced me—
The common road which all reports agree
Must at some time by all that live be gone, And where love's cure is found-Oblivion.
Ah !
could I drink it all, I should not slake
My passionate longing:
at thy gates I take My last farewell, thereto commit indeed My latest sigh.
The future I can read-
The rose is beautiful, the rose of prime, But soon it withers at the touch of time;
And beautiful in spring-time to behold
The violet, but ah !
it soon grows old;
White are the lilies, but they soon decay;
White is the snow, but soon it melts away;
And beautiful the bloom of virgin youth, But lives a very little time in sooth.
Thy time will come-thou too at last shalt prove, And weep most bitterly, the flames of love.
But grant, I pray thee, grant my latest prayer:
When thou shalt see me hanging high in air, E'en at thy door—O pass not heedless by !
But drop a few tears to my memory.
From the harsh thong unloose thy hapless lover, And from thy limbs a garment take and cover
The lifeless body, and the last kiss give ;
Fear not that haply I may come alive
At thy lip's touch—I cannot live again ;
Thy kiss, if given in love, were given in vain !
Hollow a mound to hide my love's sad end, And thrice on leaving, cry, 'Here lie, my friend And, if thou wilt, by thee this word be said, ‘Here lies my love, my beautiful is dead.'
And let this epitaph mine end recall, Just at the last I scratch it on thy wall:
‘Love slew him :
stop and say,- Who here is laid Well but not wisely loved a cruel maid.' "
Then in the doorway for its cruel use
He set a stone;
he fitted next the noose ;
Put in his neck, and eagerly he sped, Spurning the stone away-and swung there dead.
But when she saw the corse her doorway kept, She was not moved in spirit, nor she wept:
She felt no ruth, but, scornful to the last, She spat upon the body, as she past;
And careless went to bathe her and adorn, Where stood a statue of the god, her scorn.
From the bath's marble edge whereon it stood, The statue leapt and slew her:
with her blood
The water was impurpled, and the sound
Of the girl's dying accent swam around :
— "
Ah lovers !
she that scorned true love is slain ;
Love is revengeful:
when loved, love again."ALCMENA having washed her twin delight, Her Hercules, who then was ten months old, And her Iphicles, younger by a night, Gave them the breast, then laid them in the hold Of a brass shield won by Amphitryon bold-
The spoil of Pterelas in battle slain;
And, touching either head, her blessing told :
“Sleep, healthful sleep enjoy my blessed twain ;
Sleep happy !
happy wake at coming dawn again.
"And with these words she rocked the mighty shield, And sleep came over them:
in the midnight, What time the Bear, watching Orion's field, (Who then his shoulder shows uprising bright,)
To setting turns, vex'd Hera's wily spite, With many threats of her revengeful ire, To eat the infant Hercules outright, Sent to the chamber-door two monsters dire, Each bristling horribly with his dark-gleaming spire.
They their blood-gorging bellies on the ground Uncoiling rolled ;
their eyes shot baleful flame, And evermore they spat their poison round;
But when, quick brandishing with evil aim Their forked tongues, they to the children came, They both awoke :
(what can escape Jove's eye ?)
Light in the chamber shone ;
and who can blame
Or wonder that Iphicles did outcry, Screaming, when he did their remorseless teeth espy ?
He kicked aside the woollen coverlet, Struggling to flee ;
but Hercules comprest, Relaxing not the gripe his hand did get, With a firm grasp the throat of either pest, Where is their poison, which e'en gods detest.
The boy, that in the birth was long confined, Who ne'er was known to cry, though at the breast A suckling yet, they with their coils entwined :
Infolding him they strained their own release to find,Till wearied in their spines they loosed their fold.
Alcmena heard the noise and woke in fear :
— "
Amphitryon, up !
for me strange fear doth hold-
Up ! up !
don't wait for sandals ;
don't you hear Iphicles screaming ?
see !
the walls appear Distinctly shining in the dead of night, As though 'twere dawn.
There is some danger near ;
I'm sure there is, dear man !"
He then outright Did leap from off the bed to hush his wife's affright.
And hastily his costly sword he sought;
Suspended near his cedar-bed it hung ;
With one hand raised the sheath of lotus wrought, While with the other he the belt unswung.
The room was filled with night again :
he sprung, And for his household, breathing slumber deep, He loudly called ;
his voice loud echoing rung :
" Ho!
from the hearth bring lights !
quick !
do not creep !
Fling wide the doors-awake !
this is no time for sleep.
"They hastened all with lights at his command ;
But when they saw (their eyes they well might doubt)
A serpent clutched in either tender hand
Of suckling Hercules, they gave a shout, And clapped their hands :
he instantly held out The serpents to Amphitryon, and wild With child-like exultation leaped about, And laid them at his father's feet and smiled-
Laid down those monsters grim, in sleep of death now mild.
Alcmena to her fragrant bosom drew Iphicles screaming and with fear half-dead ;
The lamb-wool coverlet Amphitryon threw O'er Hercules and went again to bed.
The cocks, the third time crowing, heralded
The day-dawn:
then Alcmena sent to call Tiresias the seer, who truly said Whate'er he said would be ;
and told him all, And bade him answer her what thing would thence befall:
"
Hide not, I pray, from reverence for me
If aught of ill the gods design :
'tis clear
What fate has spun for him no man can flee ;
But saying this I teach the wise, good seer !”
He answered :
" Woman !
privileged to bear
The noblest offspring, princess of the blood Of Perseus, by my own sweet light I swear, Which once was in these eyes, as name for good Shall be remembered long Alcmena's womanhood."
The Achæan women while they spin, I wis, Alcmena's name to latest eve shall sing ;
And famous shalt thou be in Argolis ;
For this thy son to star-paved heaven shall spring :
All that contend with the broad-breasted king, Or man or beast, shall yield the victory.
Twelve labours wrought, him Destiny shall bring To Jove's own house, but all of him can die On the Trachinian pyre shall perish utterly."
And he the son-in-law of her shall be, Who sent these dragons to destroy the child ;
Then in his lair the sharp-toothed wolf shall see
The fawn, nor harm it, wonderfully mild.
In the hearth-ashes let there now be piled All sorts of thorn, bramble, and prickly pear, And dry, wind-shaken twigs of buck-thorn wild ;
And at the midnight burn these dragons here, Since they to slay the child at midnight did appear."
A maid must cast these ashes with the wind
At morn from yon rock to the rushing tide, Then hasten home and never look behind.
With sulphur let the house be purified ;
Pure water, mixed with salt, from side to side
Then from a full urn sprinkle on the floor :
For so the holy custom doth provide ;
And sacrifice to Zeus supreme a boar, That o'er your foes you may be victors evermore.
"Then, rising from the ivory chair, withdrew Tiresias, and bent with years was he.
But Hercules with his fond mother grew, As grows a young plant in a fruitful lea, And still Amphitryon's boy was thought to be :
Linus, Apollo's son, heroic name !
Instructed him in letters carefully.
And Eurytus, who from rich parents came, Taught him to bend the bow and take unerring aim.
To move his fingers on the harp with ease, And to the music minstrelsy to sing, Him taught Eumolpus Philammonides:
And with what sleights the men of Argos fling Each other, wrestling fiercely in the ring, And every sort of pugilistic sleight, Him taught the son of the Cyllenian king, Harpalicus, whose dreadful brow did fright Men from afar, that few would dare with him to fight.
To drive the chariot, and impel, control
The rapid-bounding steeds, and how to shun Dashing his axle-nave against the goal, He was instructed by Amphitryon, Who willingly did teach his hopeful son :
In Argos oft, whose praises are far-spoken For generous steeds, himself had prizes won ;
And of his skill there was this certain token, Though time had marred the reins, his chariot was unbroken.
In stationary fight to aim the lance, Shielding himself;
to bide swords flashing round ;
To draw his battle out, and bid advance
The cavalry;
to scan the foeman's ground, While to the charge the troops impetuous bound,- He learned from Castor, who, till he was old, Of demigods was warrior most renowned, Exiled from Argos then, which Tydeus bold With all the vine-land broad did from Adrastus hold.
Alcmena thus had taught her Hercules.
His sleeping-place was near his father's bed;
And, what did most of all his fancy please, For the bold boy a lion's hide was spread.
His morning meal, roast meat and Dorian bread-
No ploughman would a larger loaf desire;
His evening meal (the day already sped)
Was very light;
nor such as needed fire.
He always wore, bare to his knees, a plain attire.
WHEN, to perform his fated lord's behest, Amphitryon's son, with toils and perils tried, Hero with the prodigious breadth of breast,- In his right hand his club, the lion's hide Hung from his shoulders by the fore-feet tied,- To the rich vale of fruitful Elis came, Where the sweet waters of Alphëus glide, Seeing herds, flocks, and pastures, none might claim, But only wealthiest lord, some prince well known to fame,He asked a countryman, whose watchful care O'erlooked the grounds, (his task was his delight,) “Good friend!
wilt tell a traveller, whose are These herds, and flocks, and pastures infinite ?
He is, I well may guess, the favourite Of the Olympian gods.
Here should abide
Those I am come to seek."
The man, at sight And claim of stranger, quickly laid aside
The work he had in hand, and courteously replied :
"
What thou dost ask I willingly will tell, Good stranger !
for I fear the heavy wrath Of Hermes, the way-god ;
of all who dwell Above us, most is he provoked, when scath Or scorn is done to him who asks his path.
Not in one pasture all the flocks appear, Nor in one region, King Augeias hath:
Some pasture where Elisson glides ;
some, where Alpheus ;
at vine-clad Buprasion some ;
some, here :
"
And every flock has its particular fold.
Their pasture never fails his numerous kine
In the green lowlands that receiving hold The gush of Peneus, and the dew divine:
As in the genial moisture they recline, The meads throw up soft herbage, which supplies
The strength of the horned kine.
Beyond the shine
Of the far-gliding river-turn your eyes A little to the left-their stalled enclosure lies ;
"
Yonder, where the perennial planes elate Stand lordly, and the green wild-olives grow,- A grove to King Apollo dedicate, The pastoral god, most perfect god we know.
Hard by, our dwellings in a lengthened row ;
Our labour an immense revenue yields
To our good lord, as often as we sow, When thrice or four times ploughed, the fallow fields :
Each of his husbandmen the spade or hoe that wields," Earthing the vine-roots, or at vintage-tide Toils at the wine-press, knows where the domain Of rich Augeias ends on every side.
For his is all the far-extended plain, Orchards thick-set with trees, and fields with grain, E'en to the fount-full hill-tops far away ;
All which we work at (as behoves the swain, Whose life is spent a-field) through all the day.
Why thou art come-to tell may be thy profit-say."
Dost seek Augeias, or some one of those
Who serve him ?
I will give an answer clear, And to the point, as one that fully knows.
Not mean art thou, nor of mean sires, I'd swear, So grand thy form.
The sons of gods appear Such among men."
To him Jove's son replied :
"
In truth, old man !
for that did bring me here, Augeias I would see :
if it betide Th' Epeän chief doth in the city now abide, " And, caring for the folk, as j udge fulfils True judgment;
bid his trusty steward me speed, With whom as guide I may converse.
God wills
That mortal men should one another need."
To him the husbandman :
"
It seems, indeed, Thy way was heaven-appointed :
in thine aim, E'en to thy wish, thou dost at once succeed;
For yesterday Augeias hither came, With his illustrious son, Phyleüs hight by name.
"After long time, his rural wealth to see, He came:
to this e'en princes are not blind, The master there, his house will safer be.
But let us to the stall;
there shall we find Augeias."
Led the way that old man kind :
Seeing the great hand-filling club, and spoil
Of the wild beast, he puzzled much his mind, Who he could be, come from what natal soil;
And with desire to ask him this did inward boil,But caught the word just to his lips proceeding, For fear he might with question indiscreet, Or out of place, annoy the stranger speeding:
'Tis a hard thing another's thought to weet.
The hounds both ways, by scent and fall of feet, Perceived them from afar.
At Hercules
They flew, loud barking at him, but did greet
The old man, whining gently as you please, And round him wagged their tails, and fawning licked his knees.
But he with stones-to lift them was enough-
Scared back the hounds, their barking did restrain,
And scolded them ;
but, though his voice was rough, His heart was glad they did such guard maintain, When he was absent.
Then he spoke again:
" Gods !
what an animal!
what faithful suit
He does to man !
if he where to abstain,
Where rage, but knew, none other might dispute With him in excellence ;
but 'tis too fierce a brute.
"And soon they reached the stall.
The sun his steeds Turned to the west, bringing the close of day.
The herds and flocks, returning from the meads, Came to the stables where they nightly lay.
The kine in long succession trod the way, Innumerous ;
as watery clouds on high, By south or west wind driven in dense array, One on another press, and forward fly, Numberless, without end, along the thickened sky;
So many upon so many impels the wind;
Others on others drive their crests to twine:
So many herds so many pressed behind ;
The plain, the ways, were filled in breadth and line;
The fields were straitened with the lowing kine.
The sheep were folded soon ;
the cattle, too, That inward, as they walk, their knees incline, Were all installed, a multitude to view :
No man stood idle by for want of work to do.
Some to the kine their wooden shoes applied, And bound with thongs;
while some in station near To milk them took their proper place beside :
One to the dams let go their younglings dear, Mad for the warm milk;
while another there
The milk-pail held, the curds to cheese one turned:
Meanwhile Augeias went by every where, And with his own eyes for himself he learned
What revenue for him his cattle-keepers earned.
With him his son and mighty Hercules Through his exceeding show of riches went.
And, though his mind Amphitryonides Was wont to keep on balance and unbent, At sight thereof he was in wonderment:
Had he not seen it, he'd have thought it fable, That any one, however eminent For wealth, or any ten, in fold, stall, stable, The richest of all kings, to show such wealth were able.
Hyperion gave unto his son most dear, That he should all in flocks and herds excel.
His care increased them more from year to year;
For on his herds no sort of ailment fell, Such as destroys the cattle:
his grew well, In pith improving still.
None cast their young,
Which almost all were female.
He could tell Three hundred white-skinned bulls his kine among, And eke two hundred red, that to their pastime sprung.
Twelve swan-white bulls were sacred to the sun, All inknee'd bulls excelling;
these apart Cropped the green pasture, and were never done Exulting;
when from thicket shag did dart Wild beasts, among the herds to play their part, These twelve first rushed, death-looking, to the war, Roaring most terribly.
In pride of heart And strength great Phaethon (men to a star Did liken him) was first, mid many seen afar.
When this bull saw the tawny lion's hide, He rushed on watchful Hercules, intent To plunge his armed forehead in his side:
But then the hero grasped incontinent
The bull's left horn, and to the ground back-bent His heavy neck;
then backward pressed his might.
The bull, more struggling as more backward sent, At last stood, stretching every nerve, upright.
The king, and prince, and swains, all marvelled at the sight.
But to the city, on the following day, Bold Hercules and prince Phyleüs sped.
At first their path through a thick vineyard lay, Narrow, and 'mid the green, through which it led, Half-hid.
This past, Phyleüs turned his head O'er his right shoulder, soon as they did reach
The public road, and to the hero said, Who walked behind him :
“Friend, I did impeach Myself as having lost, concerning thee, some speech" I long since heard :
now I remember me, A young Achæan hither on a day From Argos came, from sea-shore Helice, Who, many Epeans present, then did say He saw an Argive man a monster slay, A lion, dread of all the country round, Whose lair in grove of Zeus the Nemean lay:
I am not sure if on Tirynthian ground, Or else in Argos born, or in Mycenian bound;
"But said, if I remember rightly now, The hero sprung from Perseus:
I confess Methinks none other Argive man but thou Dared that adventure:
yea!
that piece of dress,
The lion's hide, avows that hardiness.
Then, hero, first of all explain tome, That I may know if right or wrong my guess, Whether thou art in truth that very he, Whose deed was told us by the man of Helice."
Next, tell how thou didst slay the dreadful beast, And how his way to Nemean haunt he found:
One, if he searched in Apian land at least, Such monster could not find, though bears abound, Boars and destructive wolves, the country round:
Wherefore all marvelled at the man's recital, And thought the traveller, with idle sound Of his invented wonders, in requital Of hospitable rites, was striving to delight all.
"Then from the mid-path to the road-side near Phyleüs kept, that both abreast might find Sufficient room, and he might better hear What Hercules should say, who, still behind, To him replied:
" Not from the truth declined, But with just balance thou hast judged it well:
Since thou would'st hear, I with a willing mind Will tell, Phyleüs, how the monster fell, But whence he came nor I, nor Argive else can tell.
“Only we think that some immortal sent, For holy rites profaned or left undone, That ill on the Phoronians;
forth he went, And the Piseäns, like a flood, o'errun :
The Bembinaeans least of all could shun His fateful wrath;
they, nearest, fared the worst:
To slay that terrible redoubted one Was task enjoined me by Eurystheus erst;
His wish I undertook, of my set toils the first.
"My flexile bow I took, and quiver full
Of arrows, and my club, the bark still on, The stem of a wild olive I did pull Up by the roots, when thither I was gone, Under the brow of holy Helicon.
But when I came to the huge lion's lair, I to the tip the string did straightway don, And fix'd one of the arrows which I bare:
To see, ere I was seen, I looked around with care.
“It was the mid-day, and not yet I found His traces ;
nor could hear his mighty roar.
I saw no herdsman, ploughman on the ground, To point me where I should his haunt explore:
Green fear kept every man within his door.
Nor till I saw him and his vigour tried, Ceased I to search the sylvan mountain o'er;
And ere came on the cool of eventide, Back to his cavern, gorged with flesh and blood, he hied.
"His dew-lap, savage face, and mane, were gory;
He licked his beard, while I, yet unespied, Lurked in a thicket of the promontory ;
But as he nearer came, at his left side I shot an arrow, but it did not glide, Though sharp, into his flesh, but with rebound Fell on the grass.
The thick he closely eyed, His bloody head up-lifting from the ground, And ghastly grinned, showing his teeth's terrific round."
Then on the string another shaft I placed, And shot—vext that the former idly flew :
Mid-breast I hit him, where the lungs are placed:
His hide the sharp, sharp arrow pierced not through, But at his feet fell ineffectual too :
Again a third I was in act to shoot, Enraged to think in vain my bow I drew, When I was seen by the blood-thirsty brute, Who to the battle-thought his angry signs did suit. "
With his long tail he lashed himself;
and all
His neck was filled with wrath:
the fiery glow
Of his vext mane up-bristled ;
in a ball
He gathered up himself, till like a bow His spine was arched :
as when one, who doth know Chariots to build, excelling in his art, Having first heated in a fire-heat slow Bends for his wheel a fig-branch ;
with a start
The fissile wild-fig flies far from his hands apart.
"Collected for the spring, and mad to rend me, So leapt the lion from afar :
I strove With skin-cloak, bow, and quiver to defend me With one hand;
with the other I up-hove My weighty club, and on his temple drove, But broke in pieces the rough olive wood On his hard shaggy head :
he from above Fell ere he reached me, by the stroke subdued, And nodding with his head on trembling feet he stood.
"
Darkness came over both his eyes :
his brain
Was shaken in the bone ;
but when I spied
The monster stunned and reeling from his pain, I cast my quiver and my bow aside, And to his neck my throttling hands applied, Before he could recover.
I did bear me With vigour in the death-clutch, and astride
His body from behind from scath did clear me, So that he could not or with jaw or talons tear me.
"His hind feet with my heels I pressed aground ;
Of his pernicious throat my hands took care ;
His sides were for my thighs a safe-guard found From his fore-feet:
till breathless high in air I lifted him new sped to hell's dark lair.
Then many projects did my thoughts divide, How best I might the monster's carcass bare, And from his dead limbs strip the shaggy hide :
Hard task it was indeed, and much my patience tried."
I tried and failed with iron, wood, and flint;
For none of these his skin could penetrate ;
Then some immortal gave to me a hint With his own talons I might separate
The carcass and the hide :
success did wait
The trial of this thought;
he soon was flayed.
I wear his hide, that serves me to rebate Sharp-cutting war.
The Nemean beast was laid Thus low, which had of men and flocks much havoc made."THREE troops three sisters to the mountain led;
Agavé with' her cheeks that blossomed red
The bloom of apple ;
and in wildest mood Autonöa and Ino.
From the wood
They stript oak-leaves and ivy green as well, And from the ground the lowly asphodel;
In a pure lawn with these twelve altars placed;
Nine Dionysus, three his mother graced;
Then from the chest the sacred symbols moved, And, as their god had taught them and approved, Upon the leafy altars reverent laid.
Hid in a native mastic's sheltering shade, Them from a steep rock Pentheus then surveyed.
Him perched aloft Autonöa first discerned, And dreadful shrieked, and spurning overturned
The sacred orgies of the frenzied one, Which none profane may ever look upon.
She maddened, maddened all:
scared Pentheus fled, And they, with robes drawn up, pursued :
He said:
" What want ye, dames !
"
Autonöa then:
" Thou, fellow !
Shalt know, not hear "-and mightily did bellow, Loud as a lioness her brood defending ;
His mother clutched his head, whilst Ino rending Tore off his shoulder, trod and trampled o'er him ;
Autonöa likewise:
limb from limb they tore him.
Then all returned to Thebes;
defiled with gore, They of their Pentheus only fragments bore, Their after-grief.
This troubles not my mind :
Not let another, impotent and blind, Name Dionysus as hereby defiled,— Nor though he harsher used some curious child.
May I my life to holy courses give, Dear to the holy who reproachless live !
This omen, sent from aegis-bearing Jove, Shows what he hates, and what his thoughts approve ;
Blest are the children of the godly-ever ;
Blest are the children of the godless-never.
Hail, Blessed!
whom Jove's thigh enclosed for us, Till thou wert born on snowy Dracanus.
Hail, Semele !
Cadmean sisters, hail !
Whose names in songs of heroines prevail.
By Dionysus this (no need of shame) Possest ye did.
The gods let no man blame.
A COWHERD with chaste Helen ran away.
This Helen here was kist by one to-day.
Boast not:
they say there's nothing in a kiss.
But in mere kissing is some touch of bliss.
I wipe my mouth-and off thy kiss is ta'en.
Wipe you your mouth ?
then let me kiss again.
Calves, not a maid, to kiss doth you beseem.
Boast not:
thy youth is flying like a dream.
Ripe grapes are raisins, and dry roses sweet.
Come to yon olives :
I would fain repeat-I will not :
you deceived me once indeed.
Come to yon elms, and hear me play my reed.
Play to yourself:
nought wretched pleases me.
Take heed:
the Paphian will be wroth with thee.
A fig for her, if Artemis be kind.
Hush !
lest she smite you and for ever bind.
Not me—my guard is Artemis the wise.
Canst thou fly Love-none other virgin flies ?
By Pan !
I fly him :
he doth ever drive you.
I fear that Love to some worse man may give you.
Many have woo'd me, but have pleased me—none.
And I am come-of many wooers one.
What can I do ?
marriage brings only care.
Not pain, nor grief, but joys which sweetest are.
They say that women fear their wedded dears.
They rule them rather:
show me one that fears.
Lucina's bolt-the child-bed pang I dread.
Thy sovran, Artemis, puts wives to bed.
Child-bearing will my fine complexion blight.
Thy children will become thy bloom and light.
If I consent, what spouse-gifts shall be mine ?
My pastures, groves, and herd, shall all be thine.
Swear, when 'tis done, thou never wilt forsake me.
By Pan !
not even shouldst thou try to make me.
Chamber and hall will you for me provide ?
Chamber and hall, and fleeces fine beside.
What ?
what shall I my aged father tell ?
Hearing my name, he'll like thy marriage well.
Daphnis, Nomæa's son by Lycidas.
A good descent, but than mine own not higher.
I know it well—Menalcas is thy sire.
Show me thy grove, where stands thy wealthy stall.
See where for me flowers many a cypress tall.
Feed, goats!
while I my lover's wealth inspect.
Feed, bulls !
while I the virgin's way direct.
Hands off!
what business have they in my dress!
First these love-apples will I gently press.
By Pan !
I shudder-take your hand away.
Dear little trembler !
your alarm allay.
The ditch is dirty:
would you throw me down ?
I spread a soft white fleece beneath your gown.
Why do you loose my zone ?
what do you mean ?
This first I offer to the Paphian queen.
Some one will see us :
hist!
I hear a sound.
The cypresses thy marriage whisper round.
My dress is spoiled:
ah me!
what shall I do ?
I'll give thee, love, a better one and new.
Perhaps e'en salt you will not give to me.
Would I could give my very soul to thee!
Pardon, Queen Artemis !
my broken vow.
Eros a calf, Cypris shall have a cow.
I go a woman, who a virgin came.
For virgin thine a wife's and mother's name.
Thus whispered they, their youthful prime enjoying, With their fresh limbs in furtive marriage toying.
She rose and to her flock went, seeming sad, Blushing and shamefaced, but at heart was glad ;
And to his herd the happy Daphnis sped, Rejoicing greatly in his marriage-bed.
DISTAFF !
quick implement of busy thrift, Which housewives ply, blue-eyed Athene's gift!
We go to rich Miletus, where is seen
The fane of Cypris 'mid the rushes green:
Praying to mighty Zeus for voyage fair, Thither to Nicias would I now repair, Delighting and delighted by my host, Whom the sweet-speaking Graces love the most
Of all their favourites ;
thee, distaff bright!
Of ivory wrought with art most exquisite, A present for his lovely wife I take.
With her thou many various works shalt make;
Garments for men, and such as women wear Of silk, whose colour is the sea-blue clear.
And she so diligent a housewife is, That ever for well-ankled Theugenis Thrice in a year are shorn the willing sheep
Of the fine fleeces which for her they keep.
She loves what love right-minded women all ;
For never should a thriftless prodigal
Own thee with my consent:
'twere shame and pity !
Since thou art of that most renowned city, Built by Corinthian Archias erewhile, The marrow of the whole Sicilian isle.
But in the house of that physician wise, Instructed how by wholesome remedies From human-kind diseases to repel, Thou shalt in future with Ionians dwell, In beautiful Miletus ;
that the fame For the best distaff Theugenis may claim, And thou may'st ever to her mind suggest
The memory of her song-loving guest.
The worth of offering from friend we prize
Not in the gift but in the giver lies.
THEY say, my dear, that wine and truth agree:
To speak truth in my cups beseemeth me.
And I will tell you all my secret thought;
You do not wholly love me as you ought.
All of my life-the half that is not fled, Lives only in your form-the rest is dead.
Just as you will, my life is one delight, Like that of gods,-or glooms in thickest night.
How is it right to vex one loves you so ?
Take my advice ;
you will hereafter know, That I your elder taught you for the best, And, to believe me, was your interest.
In one tree build one nest;
so shall not creep Some crawling mischief to disturb your sleep.
See !
how you change about for ever now,
Never two days together on one bough.
And if one .chance to praise your lovely face, Him more than friend of three years proof you grace :
To him that loved you first you are as cold, As to a mere acquaintance three days old.
But now you breathe of wantonness and pride ;
Like should love like ;
in love be this your guide ;
So do, and good renown you shall obtain, And Love will never visit you with pain, Who mortal hearts can easily subdue, And made me, heart of iron, dote on you.
In all the changes of your fitful will, Unchanged I live but in your kisses still.
Remember that you were last year, last week, Younger than now :
we grow old while we speak.
Wrinkles soon come;
and Youth speeds on amain, Wings on her shoulders, ne'er to come again:
We, slow-foot mortals, cannot overtake Birds, or what else a winged passage make.
Take thought, and be more mild :
to me, who burn
In love for you, a guileless love return, That when your bloom of youthful beauty ends, We may be time-enduring, faithful friends.
But if you cast my words unto the wind, Or piqued to anger murmur in your mind, " Why dost thou trouble me ?"
I for thy sake, And thy much scorn, myself will straight betake, Where the gold apples their sweet fragrance spread, To Cerberus, the keeper of the dead.
Then freed from love, and all its anxious pain, E'en at thy call, I could not come again.
CYPRIS, when she saw Adonis Cold and dead as any stone is, All his dark hair out of trim, And his fair cheek deadly dim, Thither charged the Loves to lead The cruel boar that did the deed.
And they, swiftly overflying
All the wood where he was lying, Soon the hapless creature found, And with cords securely bound.
One the captive dragged along Holding at its end the thong;
While another with his bow Struck behind and made him go.
Path of fear they made him tread- Aphrodite was his dread.
Him the goddess thus addrest:
" Of all beasts thou wickedest!
Thou !
didst thou this white thigh tear ?
Didst thou smite my husband dear ? "
Fearfully, then, answered he :
“Cypris !
I do swear to thee By thyself and husband dear, By the very bonds I wear, By these huntsmen, never I Meant to tear thy husband's thigh ;
Thinking there a statue stood, In the fever of my blood, I was mad a kiss to press
On the naked loveliness :
But my long tusk pierced the boy:
Punish these, and these destroy, Tusks that worse then useless prove-
What had they to do with love ?
And if this suffice not, pray, Cypris !
cut my lips away-
What had they to do with kissing ? "
Cypris then, her wrath dismissing, Pitied him that knew no better ;
And she bade them loose his fetter.
The boar, from that time of her train, Went not to the wood again ;
But, approaching to the fire, Fairly burned out his desire.
IF for good sport one prays and lucky gains,
Who from the sea his livelihood obtains, His nets his plough ;
let him at evening-fall, Offering a “white fish," on this goddess call-
The fish called " white " as brightest that doth swim ;
Nor shall his prayer be without fruit for him :
For let him throw his nets into the sea,
And he shall draw them full as they can be.
THICK-GROWING thyme, and roses wet with dew, Are sacred to the sisterhood divine Of Helicon :
the laurel, dark of hue, The Delphian laurel, Pythian Pæan, thine!
For thee shall bleed the white ram which doth chew The downward hanging branch of turpentine.
To Pan, the fair-cheeked Daphnis, whose red lip
To his sweet pipe the pastoral wild notes married, Offered his pipe, crook, fawn-skin, spear, and scrip, Wherein he formerly his apples carried.
Daphnis !
thou sleepest on the leaf-strown ground-
Thy hunting-nets are on the mountain pight:
Thee Pan is hunting-thee Priapus crowned With ivy and its golden berries bright:
Into the cavern both together bound:
Up !
shake off sleep, and safety find in flight.
Where yon oak-thicket by the lane appears, A statue newly made of fig is seen, Three-legged, the bark on still, but without ears, Witness of many a prank upon the green.
A sacred grove runs round ;
soft-bubbling near, A spring perennial from its pebbly seat Makes many a tree to shoot and flourish there, The laurel, myrtle, and the cypress sweet;
And the curled vine with clusters there doth float:
Their sharp shrill tones the vernal blackbirds ring, And yellow nightingales take up the note, And, warbling to the others, sweetly sing.
There, goatherd !
sit, and offer up for me Prayer to the rural god :
if from my love
He only will consent to set me free, A kid shall bleed in honour of his grove.
If I must love, then, should my love succeed
By his good grace, the fattest lamb I rear, A. heifer, and a ram for him shall bleed:
Freely I offer, may he kindly hear!
For the Nymphs’ sake thy double flute provoke
To breathe some sweetness:
I the harp will take, And make it vocal to the quill's quick stroke ;
And Daphnis from the pipe sweet sounds will shake.
Come !
let us stand beside the thick-leaved oak, Behind the cave, and goat-foot Pan awake.
What boots it thee to weep away both eyes, Sad Thyrsis !
of thy pretty kid bereft:
The wild wolf seizes it, and bounding flies, And the dog barks-at his successful theft.
What profit now from weeping can arise ?
For of the kid, nor bone nor dust is left.
The son of Paean to Miletus came, And with the best physician, Nicias, staid, Who, daily kindling sacrificial flame, From fragrant cedar had this statue made.
The highest price was paid Eëtion's fame, Who all his skill upon the work outlaid.
Stranger!
the Syracusian Orthon gives thee charge:
Walk not o' winter nights, with many a cup Reeling :
from this, instead of country large, I have a foreign mound-that shuts me up.
Man!
spare thy life, nor out of season be A voyager:
man's term of life soon flies.
For Thasus Cleonicus put to sea From Cœlesyria with his merchandise:
What time the Pleiad hastes to set, went he, And, with the Pleiad, sunk-no more to rise.
To you, this marble statue, Muses nine !
Xenocles placed ;
the harmonist, whose skill No man denies :
owning your aid divine, He by your aid is unforgotten still.
This is the monument of Eusthenes, Who from one's face his mind and temper knew.
In a strange land all rites the dead can please He had-and he was dear to poets too.
Nothing was wanting to his obsequies:
Homeless, he had dear friends and mourners true.
UPON A TRIPOD DEDICATED TO BACCHUS BY DEMOTELES.
Sweet Dionysus !
sweetest god of all!
To thee this tripod and thy statue placed
The leader of the choir, Damoteles.
Only small praise did on his boyhood fall, But now his manhood is with victory graced, And more, that him virtue and honour please
The heavenly Cypris, not the popular this:
So call her bending lowly on thy knees.
The chaste Chrysogona, for nuptial bliss, Had it set in the house of Amphicles, Her life-long spouse-his home, heart, children, hers:
Their life, begun with thee, from year to year Was happier, goddess!
They are ministers
Of their own blessings, who the gods revere.
Leaving a little son, Eurymedon !
Dead in thy prime, thou in this tomb dost lie;
Thou dwellest with the blest:
thy little son
The state will prize for thy dear memory.
Traveller !
by this it will be understood, If thou dost equal hold the bad and good :
If not, then say:
" Light lie this mound upon
The sacred head of good Eurymedon.
"Stranger!
this statue view with care, And say, when homeward you repair:
" In Teos lately saw these eyes The statue of Anacreon wise.
If ever bard in bower or hall Sang sweetly, sweetest he of all.
Most of all things he loved in sooth
The unblown loveliness of youth."
Thus will you, stranger, in a little Express the whole man to a tittle.
We Dorian Epicharmus praise in Dorian, Who first wrote comedy, but now, alas!
Instead of the true man, the race Pelorian, Bacchus!
to thee present him wrought in brass.
Here stands he in their wealthy Syracuse, Known for his wealth and other service true :
To all he many a saw of practic use Declared:
and mighty honour is his due.
Medeius to his Thracian nurse had made
This way-side monument, scored with her name:
Her nursing cares are to the woman paid :
Why not ?
her usefulness shall live to fame.
Stay, and behold the old Iambic poet, Archilochus, of infinite renown-
That he is known to east and west doth show it:
The Muses and Apollo him did crown With choicest gifts :
his was the poet's fire, And he could sing his verses to the lyre.
The poet of Camirus, first to sing
The labours of the lion-slaying king, The quick-hand son of Zeus omnipotent, Was our Pisander :
this his monument.
They suffered many months and years to pass
After his death-but now 'tis done in brass.
The bard Hipponax, traveller!
lies here:
If wicked, keep aloof;
if in the number Of good men thou, of good men born, draw near, Sit down, and, if thou wilt, in safety slumber.
I am Theocritus, not he that was Of Chios, but a man of Syracuse.
Philina bore me to Praxagoras:
I never flirted with another's muse.
With stranger and with citizen the same I deal:
your own deposit take away, Paying the charge:
excuse let others frame;
His debts Caïcus e'en at night will pay.
,I AND the Loves Adonis dead deplore:
The beautiful Adonis is indeed Departed, parted from us.
Sleep no more
In purple, Cypris !
but in watchet weed, All-wretched!
beat thy breast and all aread— " Adonis is no more."
The Loves and I Lament him.
Oh !
her grief to see him bleed, Smitten by white tooth on his whiter thigh, Out-breathing life's faint sugh upon the mountain high!
Adown his snowy flesh drops the black gore ;
Stiffen beneath his brow his sightless eyes;
The rose is off his lip ;
with him no more Lives Cytherea's kiss-but with him dies.
He knows not that her lip his cold lip tries,
But she finds pleasure still in kissing him.
Deep is his thigh-wound ;
hers yet deeper lies, E'en in her heart.
The Oread's eyes are dim;
His hounds whine piteously ;
in most disordered trim,Distraught, unkempt, unsandalled, Cypris rushes Madly along the tangled thicket-steep ;
Her sacred blood is drawn by bramble-bushes ;
Her skin is torn;
with wailings wild and deep
She wanders through the valley's weary sweep, Calling her boy-spouse, her Assyrian fere.
But from his thigh the purple jet doth leap
Up to his snowy navel;
on the clear Whiteness beneath his paps the deep-red streaks appear."
Alas for Cypris !" sigh the Loves, " deprived
Of her fair spouse, she lost her beauty's pride;
Cypris was lovely whilst Adonis lived, But with Adonis all her beauty died."
Mountains, and oaks, and streams, that broadly glide, Or wail or weep for her;
in tearful rills For her gush fountains from the mountain side ;
Redden the flowers from grief;
city and hills With ditties sadly wild, lorn Cytherea fills.
Alas for Cypris !
dead is her Adonis, And Echo " dead Adonis " doth resound.
Who would not grieve for her whose love so lone is ?
But when she saw his cruel, cruel wound, The purple gore that ran his wan thigh round, She spread her arms, and lowly murmured:
" Stay thee, That I may find thee as before I found, My hapless own Adonis !
and embay thee, And mingle lips with lips, whilst in my arms I lay thee.
“Up for a little !
kiss me back again
The latest kiss-brie as itself that dies
In being breathed, until I fondly "drain""
The last breath of my soul, and greedy-wise Drink it into my core.
I will devise To guard it as Adonis-since from me To Acheron my own Adonis flies, And to the drear dread king;
but I must be A goddess still and live, nor can I follow thee."
But thou, Persephona!
my spouse receive, Mightier than I, since to thy chamber drear All bloom of beauty falls:
but I must grieve Unceasingly.
I have a jealous fear
Of thee, and weep for him.
My dearest dear!
Art dead, indeed ?
away my love did fly, E'en as a dream.
At home my widowed cheer Keeps the Loves idle;
with thy latest sigh My cestus perished too;
thou rash one !
why, oh why" Did'st hunt?
so fair, contend with monsters grim?"
Thus Cypris wailed ;
but dead Adonis lies ;
For every gout of blood that fell from him,
She drops a tear;
sweet flowers each dew supplies-
Roses his blood, her tears anemonies.
Cypris !
no longer in the thickets weep ;
The couch is furnished!
there in loving guise
Upon thy proper bed, that odorous heap, The lovely body lies-how lovely!
as in sleep.
Come !
in those softest vestments now array him
In which he slept the live-long night with thee ;
And in the golden settle gently lay him,— A sad, yet lovely sight;
and let him be High heaped with flowers ;
though withered all when he Surceased.
With essences him sprinkle o'er And ointments ;
let them perish utterly, Since he, who was thy sweetest, is no more.
He lies in purple ;
him the weeping Loves deplore.
Their curls are shorn :
one breaks his bow ;
another
His arrows and the quiver ;
this unstrings, And takes Adonis' sandal off;
his brother In golden urn the fountain water brings ;
This bathes his thighs;
that fans him with his wings.
The Loves, " Alas for Cypris !” weeping say:
Hymen hath quenched his torches ;
shreds and flings
The marriage wreath away ;
and for the lay
Of love is only heard the doleful " weal-away.
Yet more than Hymen for Adonis weep The Graces ;
shriller than Dione vent Their shrieks;
for him the Muses wail and keep Singing the songs he hears not, with intent To call him back:
and would the nymph relent, How willingly would he the Muses hear!
Hush!
hush !
to-day, sad Cypris and consent
To spare thyself-no more thy bosom tear-
For thou must wail again, and weep another year.
HUNTING the birds within a bosky grove, A birder, yet a boy, saw winged Love Perched on a box-tree branch;
rejoicing saw What seemed a large bird, and began to draw His rods together, and he thought to snare Love, that kept ever hopping here and there.
Then fretting that he could not gain his end, Casting his rods down, sought his aged friend, Who taught him bird-catching-his story told, And showed Love perching.
Smiled the ploughman old, And shook his head, replying to the boy. "
Against this bird do not your rods employ ;
It is an evil creature ;
shun him—flee ;
Until you take him, happy will you be.
But if you ever come to manhood's day, He that now flies you and still bounds away, Will of himself, by no persuasion led, Come suddenly and sit upon your head.
"By me in my fresh prime did Cypris stand, Leading the child Love in her lovely hand ;
He kept his eyes fixt, downcast on the ground, While in mine ears his mother's words did sound:
— " Dear herdsman, take and teach for me, I pray, Eros to sing;
" she said, and went her way.
Him, as one fain to learn, without ado I then began to teach whate'er I knew-
Fool that I was !
how first great Pan did suit With numerous tones his new-invented flute ;
Athene wise the straight pipe's reedy hollow;
Hermes his shell;
his cithern sweet Apollo.
I taught him this;
he heeded not my lore, But sang me his love-ditties evermore-
His mother's doings—how Immortals yearn With fond desires, and how poor mortals burn.
All I taught Eros I have quite forgot;
But his love-ditties—I forget them not.
THE Muses fear not, but with heart-love true Affect wild Eros, and his steps pursue.
And if one sings with cold and loveless heart, They shun him, and will never teach their art.
But if one sings Love's agitated thrall, To him in flowing stream they hasten all.
Of this myself am proof;
for whensoe'er For some Immortal else or mortal here I would the glowing path of song explore, Stammers my tongue, and sings not as before ;
But glad and gushing flows the strain from me, Whene'er I sing of Love or Clymene.
IF sweet my songs, or these sufficient be Which I have sung to give renown to me, I know not:
but it misbeseems to strain
At things we have not learned, and toil in vain.
If sweet these songs are not, what profit more Have I to labour at them o'er and o'er ?
If Saturn's son and changeful Fate assigned A double life-time to our mortal kind, That one in joys and one in woes be past, Who had his woes first would have joys at last.
But since Heaven wills one life to man should fall, And this is very brief-too brief for all
We think to do, why should we fret and moil, And vex ourselves with never-ending toil ?
To what end waste we life exhaust our health
On gainful arts, and sigh for greater wealth ?
We surely all forget our mortal state-
How brief the life allotted us by Fate !
WHAT sweet for you has Summer or the Spring, What joy does Autumn or the Winter bring ?
Which season do you hail with most delight ?
Summer, whose fulness doth our toils requite ?
Or the sweet Autumn, when but slight distress From hunger falls on mortal wretchedness ?
Or lazy Winter-since but few are loath To cheer themselves with fire-side ease and sloth ?
Or the Spring, blushing with its bloom of flowers ?
Tell me your choice, since leisure-time is ours.
For man to judge things heavenly is unmeet, And all these seasons holy are and sweet.
But I to please you will indulge your ear, And tell my favourite season of the year.
Not Summer-then I feel the scorching sun ;
Nor Autumn-then their course diseases run ;
And hard I find to bear the Winter frore.
The chilling snow I fear, and crystal hoar.
Of all the year the Spring delights me most, Free from the scorching sun, and bitter frost.
All life-containing shapes conceive in Spring, And all sweet things are sweetly blossoming ;
And in that season of the year's delight
There is for men an equal day and night.
PHŒBUS tried all his means, and thought of new, Scarce knowing what he did in his distress ;
With nectar bathed him, with ambrosial dew;
But Fate made remedies remediless.
HAPPY is love or friendship when returned-
The lovers whose pure flames have equal burned, Happy was Theseus, e'en in Tartarus, With his true heart-friend, good Pirithous.
His Pylades Orestes lorn did bless Amid th' inhospitable Chalybes.
Blest was Achilles in a friend long tried;
Him living loved, for his sake gladly died !
Yourself to artists always to betake, And on yourself in nothing to rely Is misbeseeming:
friend !
your own pipe make
The work is easy, if you will but try.
May Love the Muses evermore invite, The Muses bring me Love !
and to requite
My passion, may they give sweet song to me, Than which no sweeter remedy can be.
When drop on drop, they say, doth ever follow, 'Twill wear the stone at last into a hollow.
I to the sandy shore and seaward slope Will go, and try with murmured song to bend
The cruel Galatea :
my sweet hope I'll cast away-when life itself doth end.
Oh, leave me not unhonoured !
Artists aim And reach at excellence, provoked by Fame.
Woman's strength is in her beauty;
- Man's—to bear and dare for duty.
WILL you, my Lycidas, now sing for me A soothing, sweet Sicilian melody- A love-song, such as once the Cyclops young
On the sea-shore to Galatea sung ?
I'll pipe or sing for you :
what shall it be ?
The song of Scyros dearly pleases me, Sweet love-the pleasant life Pelides led-
His furtive kisses, and the furtive bed.
How he, a boy, put on a virgin's dress, Assumed a virgin's mien, and seemed no less ;
And how Deïdamia, maiden coy, Found her girl bedmate was a wicked boy.
The herdsman, Paris, on an evil day, To Ida bore the lovely Helena.
CEnone grieved;
and Lacedæmon raged, And all th' Achæan s in the feud engaged:
Hellenes, Elians, and Mycenians, came, And brave Laconians, to retake the dame.
When Greece her battle led across the deep, Himself at home no warrior then might keep.
Achilles only went not then, indeed, Hid with the daughters of king Lycomede.
A seeming virgin with a virgin's bloom, Instead of arms his white hand plied the loom.
No virgin of them all had airs more fine, A rosier cheek, or step more feminine :
He veiled his hair;
but Mars and fiery Love, That stings young manhood, all his thoughts did move.
He lingered by Deidamia's side, Close as he could, from morn till eventide:
Often he kissed her hand, and often raised Her broidered work:
her work and fingers praised.
Of all the maids his only messmate she;
And he would fain his bedmate have her be.
And thus he sued with furtive meaning deep :
— "
With one another other sisters sleep ;
In station, love, and age, we twain are one, Why should we, maidens both, each sleep alone ?
Since we together are all day, I wonder
Why we are made at night to sleep asunder ?
”HESPER!
sweet Aphrodite's golden light!
Hesper !
bright ornament of swarthy Night, Inferior to the Moon's clear sheen, as far As thou outshinest every other star;
Dear Hesper, hail!
and give thy light to me, Leading the festive shepherd company.
For her new course to-day began the Moon, And is already set—O much too soon !
'Tis not for impious theft abroad I stir, Nor to way-lay the nightly traveller :
I love ;
and thou, bright star of love !
shouldst lend
The lover light-his helper and his friend.
BRIGHT Cypris!
goddess ever meek and mild, Of mightiest Zeus and loveliest sea-nymph child, Why with Immortals and our mortal kind Art thou so wroth ?
what stung thy gentle mind
To bring forth Love ?
who wills at all to strike, His cruel heart his person how unlike !
Winged and far-darter why didst make him, why, That we the cruel one can never fly ?HER
Eros thus proclaimed the Cyprian Queen "
If any one has in the highway seen My straying Eros, and reports to me His whereabouts, he shall rewarded be;
A kiss for him ;
but if it shall betide One bring him me, a kiss-and more beside.
Midst twenty he is notable to view;
Not fair, but flamy, is his dazzling hue ;
Sharp are his eyes, and flame their glances fleet;
His mind is wicked, but his speech is sweet.
His word and meaning are not like at all ;
His word is honey, and his meaning gall.
He is a mischievous, deceitful child ;
Beguiles with falsehood, laughs at the beguiled.
He has a lovely head of curling hair, But saucy features, with a reckless stare.
His hands are tiny, but afar they throw, E'en down to Dis and Acheron below.
Naked his form, his mind in covert lies;
Winged as a feathered bird, he careless flies From girls to boys, from men to women flits, Sports with their heart-strings, on their vitals sits.
Small is his bow, his arrow small to sight, But to Jove's court it wings its ready flight.
Upon his back a golden quiver sounds, Full of sharp darts, with which e'en me he-wounds.
All cruel things by cruel
Love are done ;
His torch is small, yet scorches e'en the sun.
But should you take him—fast and safely bind him,
And bring him to me with his hands behind him.
If he should weep, take heed-he weeps at will;
But should he smile--then drag him faster still
And should he offer you a kiss, beware !
Evil his kiss, his red lips poisoned are !
And should he say, with seeming friendship hot, ' Accept my bow and arrows,' touch them not !
Tears, smiles, words, gifts, deceitful wiles inspire, And every thing he has is dipt in fire."CYPRIS, when all but shone the dawn's glad beam, To fair Europa sent a pleasant dream ;
When sleep, upon the close-shut eyelids sitting, Sweeter than honey, is eye-fetters knitting, The limb-dissolving sleep !
when to and fro True dreams, like sheep at pasture, come and go.
Europa, sleeping in her upper room, The child of Phoenix, in her virgin bloom, Thought that she saw a contest fierce arise Betwixt two continents, herself the prize ;
They to the dreamer seemed like women quite, Asia, and Asia's unknown opposite.
This was a stranger, that a native seemed, And closer hugged her-so Europa dreamed ;
And called herself Europa's nurse and mother, Said that she bore and reared her;
but that other Spared not her hands, and still the sleeper drew, With her good will, and claimed her as her due, And said that Zeus Ægiochus gave her, By Fate's appointment, that sweet prisoner.
Up-started from her couch the maiden waking, And felt her heart within her bosom quaking ;
She thought it true, and sat in hushed surprise-
Still saw those women with her open eyes ;
Then to her timid voice at last gave vent :
­ "
Which of the gods to me this vision sent ?
What kind of dream is this that startled me, And sudden made my pleasant slumber flee ?
Who was the stranger that I saw in sleep ?
What love for her did to my bosom creep !
And how she hailed me, as her daughter even !
But only turn to good my vision, Heaven !
"So said, and bounded up, and sought her train Of dear companions, all of noble strain, Of equal years and stature ;
'gentle, kind, Sweet to the sight, and pleasant to the mind ;
With whom she sported, when she led the choir, Or in the river's urn-like reservoir She bathed her limbs, or in the meadow stopt, And from its bosom odorous lilies crept.
And soon around her shone the lovely band, Her flower-basket in each maiden's hand ;
And to the meadows near the pleasant shore
They sped, where they had often sped before, Pleased with the roses growing in their reach, And with the waves that murmured on the beach.
A basket by Hephæstus wrought of gold, Europa bore-a marvel to behold ;
He gave it Libya, when, a blooming bride, She went to grace the great Earth-shaker's side;
She gave it Telephassa fair and mild, Who now had given it to her virgin child.
Therein were many sparkling wonders wrought—
The hapless Iö to the sight was brought;
A heifer's for a virgin's form she wore ;
The briny paths she frantic wandered o'er, And was a swimming heifer to the view, While the sea round her darkened into blue.
Two men upon a promontory stood, And watched the heifer traversing the flood.
Again where seven-mouthed Nile divides his strand, Zeus stood and gently stroked her with his hand, And from her horned figure and imbruted To her original form again transmuted.
In brass the heifer—Zeus was wrought in gold ;
Nile softly in a silver current rolled.
And to the life was watchful Hermes shown Under the rounded basket's golden crown ;
And Argus near him with unsleeping eyes Lay stretched at length ;
then from his blood did rise
The bird, exulting in the brilliant pride
Of his rich plumes and hues diversified, And like a swift ship with her out-spread sail, Expanding proudly his resplendent tail, The basket's golden rim he shadowed o'er:
Such was the basket fair Europa bore.
They reached the mead with vernal blossoms full, And each began her favourite flowers to pull.
Narcissus one ;
another thyme did get;
This hyacinth, and that the violet;
And of the spring-sweets in the meadow found Much scented bloom was scattered on the ground.
Some of the troop in rivalry chose rather
The sweet and yellow crocuses to gather ;
Shining, as mid the Graces Cypris glows, The princess in the midst preferred the rose:
Nor long with flowers her gentle fancy charmed, Nor long she kept her virgin flower unharmed.
With love for her was Saturn's son inflamed, By unexpected darts of Cypris tamed, Who only tames e'en Zeus.
To shun the rage Of Here, and the virgin's mind engage, To draw her eyes and her attention claim, He hid his godhead and a bull became ;
Not such as feeds at stall, or then or now, The furrow cuts and draws the crooked plough ;
Not such as feeds the lowing kine among, Or trails in yoke the heavy wain along ;
His body all a yellow hue did own, But a white circle in his forehead shone ;
His sparkling eyes with love's soft lustre gleamed ;
His arched horns like Dian's crescent seemed.
He came into the meadow, nor the sight Fluttered the virgins into sudden flight.
But they desired to touch and see him near;
His breath surpassed the meadow-sweetness there.
Before Europa's feet he halted meek, Licked her fair neck, and eke her rosy cheek;
Threw round his neck her arms the Beautiful, Wiped from his lips the foam and kissed the bull;
Softly he lowed ;
no lowing of a brute
It seemed, but murmur of Mygdonian flute ;
Down on his knees he slunk ;
and first her eyed, And then his back, as asking her to ride.
The long-haired maidens she began to call :
­ "
Come let us ride, his back will hold us all, E'en as a ship ;
a bull unlike the rest, As if a human heart were in his breast, He gentle is and tractable and meek, And wants but voice his gentleness to speak.
"She said, and mounted smiling, but before Another did, he bounded for the shore.
The royal virgin, struck with instant fear, Stretched out her hands and called her playmates dear ;
But how could they the ravished princess reach ?
He, like a dolphin, pushed out from the beach.
From their sea-hollows swift the Nereids rose, Seated on seals, and did his train compose ;
Poseidon went before, and smooth did make
The path of waters for his brother's sake ;
Around their king in close array did keep
The loud-voiced Tritons, minstrels of the deep, And with their conchs proclaimed the nuptial song.
But on Jove's bull-back as she rode along, The maid with one hand grasped his branching horn, The flowing robe, that did her form adorn, Raised with the other hand, and tried to save From the salt moisture of the saucy wave ;
Her robe, inflated by the wanton breeze, Seemed like a ship's sail hovering o'er the seas.
But when, her father-land no longer nigh, Nor sea-dashed shore was seen, nor mountain high, But only sky above, and sea below-
She said, and round her anxious glance did throw :
—"
Whither with me, portentous bull ?
discover
This and thyself:
and how canst thou pass over
The path of waters, walking on the wave, And dost not fear the dangerous path to brave ?
Along this tract swift ships their courses keep, But bulls are wont to fear the mighty deep.
What pasture here ?
what sweet drink in the brine ?
Art thou a god ?
thy doings seem divine.
Nor sea-born dolphins roam the flowery mead, Nor earth-born bulls through Ocean's realm proceed;
Fearless on land, and plunging from the shores
Thou roamest ocean, and thy hoofs are oars.
Perchance anon, up-borne into the sky, Thou without wings like winged birds wilt fly !
Ah me unhappy!
who my father's home
Have left and with a bull o'er ocean roam, A lonely voyager !
my helper be, Earth-shaking regent of the hoary sea !
I hope to see this voyage's cause and guide, For not without a god these things betide.
"To her the horned bull with accent clear :
— "
Take courage, virgin !
nor the billow fear ;
The seeming bull is Zeus;
for I with ease Can take at will whatever form I please ;
My fond desire for thy sweet beauty gave
To me this shape—my footstep to the wave.
Dear Crete, that nursed me, now shall welcome thee;
In Crete Europa's nuptial rites shall be ;
From our embrace illustrious sons shall spring, And every one of them a sceptred king.
"
-And instantly they were in Crete:
his own Form Zeus put on-and off her virgin zone.
Strewed the glad bed the Hours, of joy profuse;
The whilom virgin was the bride of Zeus.YE mountain valleys, pitifully groan!
Rivers and Dorian springs, for Bion weep!
Ye plants, drop tears !
ye groves, lamenting moan !
Exhale your life, wan flowers ;
your blushes deep
In grief, anemonies and roses, steep !
In softest murmurs, Hyacinth ! prolong
The sad, sad woe thy lettered petals keep;
Our minstrel sings no more his friends among- Sicilian Muses !
now begin the doleful song.
Ye nightingales, that 'mid thick leaves let loose
The gushing gurgle of your sorrow, tell The fountains of Sicilian Arethuse That Bion is no more-with Bion fell
The song, the music of the Dorian shell.
Ye swans of Strymon, now your banks along Your plaintive throats with melting dirges swell For him who sang like you the mournful song:
Discourse of Bion's death the Thracian nymphs among;
The Dorian Orpheus, tell them all, is dead.
His herds the song and darling herdsman miss, And oaks, beneath whose shade he propt his head :
Oblivion's ditty now he sings for Dis:
The melancholy mountain silent is ;
His pining cows no longer wish to feed, But mourn for him :
Apollo wept, I wis, For thee, sweet Bion !
and in mourning weed The brotherhood of Fauns, and all the Satyr breed.
The tears by Naiads shed are brimful bourns ;
Afflicted Pan thy stifled music rues ;
Lorn Echo 'mid her rocks thy silence mourns, Nor with her mimic tones thy voice renews :
The flowers their bloom, the trees their fruitage lose No more their milk the drooping ewes supply;
The bees - to press their honey now refuse ;
What need to gather it and lay it by, When thy own honey-lip, my Bion !
thine is dry ?
SicilianMuses !
lead the doleful chaunt:
Not so much near the shore the dolphin moans ;
Nor so much wails within her rocky haunt
The nightingale;
nor on their mountain thrones
The swallows utter such lugubrious tones ;
Nor so much Cëyx wailed for Halcyon, Whose song the blue wave, where he perished, owns;
Nor in the valley, neighbour to the sun, The funeral birds so wail their Memnon's tomb upon-As these moan, wail, and weep, their Bion dead.
The nightingales and swallows, whom he taught, For him their elegiac sadness shed;
And all the birds contagious sorrow caught;
The sylvan realm was all with grief distraught.
Who bold of heart will play on Bion's reed, Fresh from his lip, yet with his breathing fraught ?
For still among the reeds does Echo feed On Bion's minstrelsy.
Pan only may succeedTo Bion's pipe;
to him I make the gift:
But lest he second seem, e'en Pan may fear
The pipe of Bion to his mouth to lift.
For thee sweet Galatea drops the tear, And thy dear song regrets, which sitting near She fondly listed;
ever did she flee The Cyclops and his song;
but far more dear
Thy song and sight than her own native sea :
On the deserted sands the nymph without her feeNow sits and weeps, or weeping tends thy herd.
Away with Bion all the muse-gifts flew—
The chirping kisses breathed at every word :
Around thy tomb the Loves their playmate rue;
Thee Cypris loved more than the kiss she drew And breathed upon her dying paramour.
Most musical of rivers !
now renew
Thy plaintive murmurs :
Meles !
now deplore
Another son of song, as thou didst wail of yore
That sweet, sweet mouth of dear Calliope:
The threne, 'tis said, thy waves for Homer spun With saddest music filled the refluent sea ;
Now melting wail and weep another son !
Both loved of fountains-that of Helicon Gave Melesigenes his pleasant draught;
To this sweet Arethuse did Bion run, And from her urn the glowing rapture quaft:
Blest was the bard who sang how Helen bloomed and laught:
On Thetis' mighty son his descant ran, And Menelaus ;
but our Bion chose Not arms and tears to sing, but Love and Pan;
While browsed his herd, his gushing music rose ;
He milked his kine ;
did pipes of reeds compose ;
Taught how to kiss;
and fondled in his breast Young Love and Cypris pleased.
For Bion flows
In every glorious land a grief contest:
Ascra for her own bard, wise Hesiod, less exprest:
Bœotian Hylæ mourned for Pindar less;
Teos regretted less her minstrel hoar, And Mytelene her sweet poetess ;
Nor for Alcæus Lesbos suffered more;
Nor lovely Pares did so much deplore Her own Archilochus.
Breathing her fire Into her sons of song, from shore to shore
For thee the Pastoral Muse attunes her lyre To woeful utterance of passionate desire.
Sicelidas, the famous Samian star,
And he with smiling eye and radiant face, Cvdonian Lycidas, renowned afar, Lament thee ;
where quick Hales runs his race, Philetus wails ;
Theocritus, the grace Of Syracuse, thee mourns ;
nor these among Am I remiss Ausonian wreaths to place Around thy tomb :
to me doth it belong
To chaunt for thee from whom I learnt the Dorian song.
Me with thy minstrel skill as proper heir Others thou didst endow with thine estate.
Alas !
alas !
when in a garden fair Mallows, crisp dill, or parsley yields to fate, These with another year rcgerminate ;
But when of mortal life the bloom and crown, The wise, the good, the valiant, and the great Succumb to death, in hollow earth shut down We sleep-for ever sleep-for ever lie unknown.
Thus art thou pent, while frogs may croak at will;
I envy not their croak.
Thee poison slew-
How kept it in thy mouth its nature ill ?
If thou didst speak, what cruel wretch could brew
The draught ?
He did, of course, thy song eschew.
But justice all o'ertakes.
My tears fast flow For thee, ray friend !
Could I, like Orpheus true, Odysseus, or Alcides, pass below To gloomy Tartarus, how quickly would I go !
To see and haply hear thee sing for Dis !
But in the Nymph's ear warble evermore, My dearest friend !
thy sweetest harmonies :
For whilom, on her own Etnæan shore, She sang wild snatches of the Dorian lore.
Nor will thy singing unrewarded be ;
Thee to thy mountain haunts she will restore, As she gave Orpheus his Eurydice.
Could I charm Dis with songs, I too would sing for thee."
WHY dost thou vex thy spirit, mother mine ?
Why fades thy cheek ?
at what dost thou repine ?
Because thy son must serve a popinjay, As though a lion did a fawn obey ?
Why have the gods so much dishonoured me ?
Why was I born to such a destiny ?
Spouse of a man I cherished as mine eyes, For whom heart-deep my vowed affection lies, Yet must I see him crossed by adverse fate, Of mortal men the most misfortunate !
Who with the arrows, which Apollo-no !
Some Fate or Fury did on him bestow, In his own house his own sons raging slew-
Where in the house was not the purple dew ?
I saw them slain by him ;
I—I, their mother, Did see their father slaughter them ;
none other Had e'er a dream like this;
to me they cried, ‘ Mother!
save us !' what could I do ?
they died.
As when a bird bewails her callow young, O'er whom, unfeathered yet, she fondly hung, Which now a fierce snake in the bush devours-
Flies round and round-shrieks-cannot help them-cowers, Nor nearer dares approach her cruel foe:
Thus I, most wretched mother!
to and fro Rushed madly through the house, my children dear, My dead, dead children wailing every where.
Would that I too had with my children died, The poisoned arrow sticking in my side !
Then with fast tears my mother and my sire
Had laid me with them on the funeral pyre ;
And to my birth-land given, on their return, Our mingled ashes in one golden urn:
But they in Thebes, renowned for steeds, remain, And still they farm their old Aonian plain ;
But in steep Tiryns I must dwell apart, With many sorrows gnawing at my heart;
Mine eyes are fountains, which I cannot close;
I seldom see him, and but brief repose
My hapless husband is allowed at home ;
By sea or land he must for ever roam;
None but a heart of iron, or of stone, Could bear the labours he has undergone.
Thou, too, like water, meltest still away, For ever weeping every night and day.
None of my kin is here to comfort me, For they beyond the piny isthmus be ;
There's none to whom I may pour out my woes, And like a woman all my heart disclose, But sister Pyrrha ;
-but she too forlorn For her Iphicles, thine and hers doth mourn;
Unhappiest mother thou ! in either son—
Twin stamps of Zeus, and of Amphitryon.
"And, while she spoke, from either tearful well
The large drops faster on her bosom fell, While she her slaughtered children called to mind, And parents in her country left behind.
With tear-stained cheek, and many a groan and sigh, Alcmena to her son's wife made reply­"
Why, hapless mother !
with this train of thought
Dost thou provoke the grief that comes unsought ?
Why dost thou talk these dreadful sorrows o'er, Now wept by us—as we have wept before ?
Are not the new griefs that we look to see From day to day, enough for you and me ?
Lover of dole were he, who would recount
Our tale of woes, and find their whole amount!
Take heart, and bear those ills we cannot cure, But by the will of heaven we must endure.
And yet I cannot bid thee cease to grieve, For even joy to spend itself has leave.
For thee I wail, why wert thou doomed, oh why, To be a partner in our misery ?
I mourn that fate with ours thy fortune blends
Under the woe that over us impends.
Ye !
by whose names unpunished none forswear, Persephona and dread Demeter, hear !
Not less on thee has my true love reposed, Than if my womb thy body had enclosed;
I love thee, sweetest!
as an old-age child, That has, beyond hope, on its mother smiled ;
Thou knowest this ;
then say not, I implore, I love thee not, or foster sorrow more, Or in my grief I careless am of thee, Though I weep more than e'er wept Niobe.
No blame is due to her with anguish wild, Who hapless weeps for her unhappy child.
Ten weary months within my womb he lay-
What pains I suffered ere he came to day!
What pangs !
I all but said farewell to earth, While yet my unborn lingered in the birth.
New toils now task him in a foreign plain-
Oh shall I ever see my son again ?
Besides, an awful vision of the night, Scaring my sleep, hath filled me with affright, And much I fear, when I my dream recall, Lest some untoward thing my sons befall.
Methought, aside his cloak and tunic laid, My Hercules with both hands grasped a spade, And round a cultured field a mighty dyke He delved, as one that toils for hire belike.
But when the dyke around the vineyard run,
And he was just about (his task now done, The shovel thrown on the projecting rim,) With his attire again to cover him ;
Sudden above the bank a fire burst out, Whose greedy flames enclosed him round about:
He to the flames with rapid flight did yield, Holding the spade before him as a shield, And here and there he turned his anxious eye, If he might shun his scorching enemy.
High-souled Iphicles, I remember well As it me-seemed, rushing to help him, fell;
Nor could he raise himself from where he rolled, But helpless lay there like some weak man old, Tript up by joyless age against his will;
Stretched on the ground he was, and seeming still Hopeless of rising, till a passer-by In pity raised the hoar infirmity.
Thus helpless lay the warrior brave in fight;
And I did weep to see that sorry sight-
This son stretched feeble, that engirt with flame, Till sleep forsook me and the day-dawn came.
Such frightful visions on my sleep did fall;
Ye gods ! on curst Eurystheus turn them all!
Oh be this presage true my wish supplies, And may no god ordain it otherwise!
”WHEN on the wave the breeze soft kisses flings, I rouse my fearful heart, and long to be Floating at leisure on the tranquil sea ;
But when the hoary ocean loudly rings, Arches his foamy back and spooming swings
Wave upon wave, his angry swell I flee :
Then welcome land and sylvan shade to me, Where, if a gale blows, still the pine-tree sings.
Hard is his life whose nets the ocean sweep, A bark his house—shy fish his slippery prey;
But sweet to me the unsuspicious sleep Beneath a leafy plane-the fountain's play, That babbles idly, or whose tones, if deep, Delight the rural ear and not affray.
PAN Echo loved ;
she loved the frisky Faun ;
The Faun to Lyda by strong love was drawn;
As Echo Pan, the Faun did Echo burn, And Lyda him:
all fell in love in turn.
And with what scorn the loved the lover grieved Was that one scorned, and like for like received.
Hear, heart-free !
let who love you love obtain,
That if you love, you may be loved again.
ALPHEUS, gliding by old Pisa's towers, Deep in the sea his eager way pursues, With sacred dust, and olive-leaves, and flowers, With which he hastens to his Arethuse.
Smoothly he runs ;
the sea not feels the river
With soft unmingled stream its water rive ;
Eros it was, that subtle counsel-giver, Who taught a river how for love to dive.
His torch and quiver down sly Eros flung, An ox-goad took in hand, a wallet slung, Then yoked strong bulls and made the plough to train, And as he went the furrow sowed with grain.
And looking up he said to Zeus, “ Make full
The harvest, or I'll yoke Europa's bull."WOULD that my sire had brought me up to feed
The happy bloaters of the fleecy flocks !
'Twould soothe my sorrow then to breathe the reed Beneath the shade of elms or hanging rocks.
Now let us fly ;
and other cities seek
To be our country, dear Pierides :
But I my mind to all will plainly speak-
Injurious drones have harmed the honey-beea.

Now it is noble for a 2brave man to die, having fallen opposite the foremost ranks, whilst fighting for his father-land.
But most grievous of all is it for a man 3 to be a beggar, hav­ ing quitted his own city and fertile fields, and wandering with a loved mother and aged father, with little children and 4 wedded wife.
For to whomsoever he shall have come, among them will he be hateful, yielding to need and to wretched poverty.
He disgraces his race, and 5 belies his fair beauty ;
and every kind of 6 dishonour and woe follows him.
Besides, for a man thus vagrant, look you, there is no care, nor has he1

With spirit let us fight for this land, and for our children die, being no longer chary of our lives.
Fight then, young men, standing fast one by another, nor 9be beginners of cowardly flight, or fear.
But rouse a great and valiant spirit in your breasts, and love not life, when ye contend with men.
And the elders, whose limbs are no longer active, the old, I say, desert not or forsake.
For surely this were shameful, that fallen amid the foremost champions, in front of the youths, an older man should lie low, 10 having his head now white and his beard hoary, and breathing out a valiant spirit in the dust;
whilst 11 he covers with his hands his gory loins, (which were a shame, and would make one wroth to behold with his eyes:
) and is stript as to his person:
12 yet all this befits the young, whilst, I wot, he enjoys the 13brilliant bloom of youth;
to mortal men and women he is lovely to look upon, whilst he lives ;
and noble when he has fallen in the foremost ranks.
Then let 14every one with firm stride await the foe, having both feet fixed on the ground, 15 biting his lip with his teeth.
BUT since ye are the race of I invincible Hercules, be ye of good courage;
not yet hath Zeus 2 turned his neck aside from you.
Neither fear ye, nor be affrighted at a host of men, but let hero hold his shield right against the foremost fighters ;
having counted life hostile, and 3 the dark fates of death dear as the rays of the sun.
For ye know that the 4 works of Ares of-many-tears are much-seen, and well have ye learned the 5 temper of troublous war.
Ye have been, 0 young men, with the flying and the pursuing, and have pushed on to a full measure of both.
Now of those, who dare, abiding one be­ side another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions, fewer die, and they save the people in the rear;
but in men 6 that fear, all excellence is lost.
No one could ever in words go through those several ills, which befall a man, 7 if he has been actuated by cowardice.
For 'tis grievous to wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war.
Shameful too is a corpse 8lying low in the dust, 9wounded behind in the back by the point of a spear.
Rather let every one with firm stride await the enemy, having both feet fixed on the ground, biting his lip with his teeth, and having covered with the 10hollow of his broad shield thighs and shins below, and breast and shoulders.
But in his right hand let him brandish a heavy lance, and 11shake above his head a threaten­ in- crest.
Then let him learn war, by doing bold deeds, nor let him stand with his shield out of the range of weapons.
But let each, drawing nigh in close fray, 12hit his foe, wound­ ing him with long lance or sword.
13 And having set foot beside foot, and having fixed shield against shield, and crest on crest, and helmet on helmet, and breast against breast, struggle in fight with his man, having seized either the hilt of his sword, or his long lance.
But do ye, 140 light-armed soldiers, crouching under your shields, some from one quarter, some from another, make them fall with huge stones, and with polished spears, as ye dart at them, and stand near to the 15 heavy-armed troops.

I WOULD neither commemorate, nor hold in account a man, either for excellence in running, or for wrestling;
no, nor though he should have the bulk and strength of the Cyclopes, and in speed surpass 2 Thracian Boreas.
No, nor though he should in personal appearance be more graceful than 3 Titho­ nus, and should be more rich than Midas or 4 Cinyras.
Nor though he should be more kingly than Pelops, son of Tantalus, and have the 5 soft-voiced tongue of Adrastus;
nor yet if he should have all glory, save that of resistless valour;
for he is not a man brave in war, 6 unless he have the courage to face bloody slaughter, and standing near attack the foemen.
But this is excellence, this the best prize among men, and noblest for a young man to carry off.
And this is a common good to a city, and all its people, namely, whatsoever man standing firm bides unceasingly in the front ranks, and is wholly for­ getful of base flight, when he has 7 staked his life, and en­ during spirit;
but has the heart to fall, standing beside his next neighbour.
This man is good in war.
And quickly does he turn in flight the sturdy phalanxes of foemen, and 8 zeal­ ously stem the wave of battle.
He too himself having fallen amid the foremost, loses his life, and (at the same time) having brought renown to his city and people and sire:
pierced in many places through breast, and round shield, and through his cuirass in the front.
Him young alike and old lament, and the whole state is distressed for him with painful regret.
His 9tomb and children are famous among men, ay, 10his children's children, and his race after him.
Never does his fair fame or his name perish, but though he be on earth, be becomes immortal, whom, bravely bearing himself, standing firm, and fighting for country and for children, impetuous Ares shall have destroyed.
But should he have escaped the fate of death that-lays-men-out-at-length ;
and as victor, have borne off the splendid boast of battle won, all honour him, young and old alike;
and 11after tasting many delights, he comes to Hades.
Growing old, he is eminent amid the citizens, nor does any one wish to hurt him in point of respect or justice.
And all 12on the seats, alike young, and those of his age, and they who are still older, give place to him.
Let every one now strive in his spirit to reach the summit of 13excellence like this, not 14slackening warfare.
How long lie ye inactive ?
when will ye have a brave spi­ rit, young men ?
and are ye not 1ashamed of the dwellers all around, since ye dally thus exceedingly ?
For ye think ye 2sit secure in peace, yet war possesses the whole land.

And let a man, as he dies, discharge his javelin for the last time.
For it is both honourable and noble for a man to fight for land, and children, and wedded wife, with his foes,;
and death will come at some time, whensoever in truth the fates shall have allotted.
But let every one, having lifted aloft his lance, and 4 gathered up his stout heart under his shield, go right forward, when the battle first is joined.
For it is not fated by any means that a man should escape death at least, no, not though he be by family of immortal ancestry.
Often 5 he comes forth, after having escaped battle-strife and din of javelins, and in his home fated death found him.
Now the latter is not in like manner a friend 6 to the commonalty, nor regretted by them, whilst the former, the brave man, small and great bewail, if aught shall have happened to him.
For the whole people together regrets a stout-hearted hero, when he dies, and living he is worthy of the demigods.
For they be­ hold him with their eyes even as a 7 tower, since, though single- handed, he performs deeds worth those of many.
