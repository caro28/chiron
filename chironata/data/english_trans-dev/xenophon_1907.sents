A BIOGRAPHICAL Notice of Xenophon is prefixed to the second volume of this translation.
Some remarks are here offered on the authorship of the " Anabasis.
"A passage of the “Hellenica,” in which it is said that a narrative of the Expedition of Cyrus was written by Themis­ togenes of Syracuse, has given rise to the question1 whether the account of that expedition which we now have is that of Xenophon or that of Themistogenes.
When Xenophon, in the course of his narrative of events relating to Greece, comes to the time at which the expedition ot'
Cyrus took place, he says,2 " How Cyrus collected an army, how he marched up the country with it against his brother, how the battle was fought, how Cyrus was killed, and how the Greeks afterwards effected a safe retreat to the sea, has been written by Themistogenes the Syracusan.
"Suidas3 also says that " Themistogenes, a Syracusan his­ torian, wrote the Anabasis of Cyrus, ἦτις ἐν το IS Ξενοφω̃ντος ’Ελληνικοῑς φέϱεται, and some other things concerning his own country."
What sense is to be given to the word φέϱεται in this passage, has been a subject of much doubt.
If the phrase containing it be translated, with Morus, quæ nomina­ tur aut laudatur in Historiâ Græcâ, a sense is given to the verb for which there is no authority;
and if it be rendered, with most interpreters, quæ inserta legitur historiis Græcis, that is said which is not true.
Kuster4 and Dindorf,5 there­ fore, suggest that the word ̔Ελληνικοῑς, which is not found in the Paris manuscripts, should be struck out.
The sense will then be, “which is inserted among the writings of Xenophon.
"Suidas being thus interpreted, the two passages will concur in showing that a narrative of the "Anabasis" was written by Themistogenes.
The next point to be considered is, whether that narrative which we now have is, or is not, the work of Themistogenes.
Plutarch, in his Considerations whether the Athenians were more renowned in Arms or in Letters,1 observes, in alluding to the historians, that “Xenophon was a subject of history for himself, for lie wrote an account of the military matters which lie successfully conducted, but represents that the account was written by Themistogenes the Syracusan, in order that he might have more credit if he spoke of himself as another person, giving to another the reputation of the work."
The passage is somewhat obscure, for there is a word, such as λέγει, want­ ing ;
I translate it in the sense in which it is taken by Leun­ clavius and Wyttenbach.
In agreement with this passage of Plutarch, Tzetzes, in his Chiliads,2 after observing that Phidias made two statues for a young man of whom he was fond, and for whose workman­ ship, it appears, they were to pass, says that "
Xenophon did the same with regard to the Anabasis of Cyrus ;
for he set a certain name to the work to please one whom he loved ;
* * * it is the book of Themistogenes the Syracusan, and afterwards came to be commonly called the work of Xenophon ;
so Plato the philosopher wrote his Dialogues under the names of his friends;
and other writers have composed innumerable things­ in a similar way.”
When he says that “it is the book of Themistogenes," τὸ βιβλίον Θεμιστογένους ἐστι, he can have n.;
other meaning but that it was given to the world by Xeno phon under the name of Themistogenes.
A Scholium, which us appended to the passage by an unknown author, states the matter more briefly and clearly:
“Xenophon inscribed the A nabasis of Cyrus with the name of Themistogenes, yet it ame to be commonly called afterwards the work of Xeno phon.
”From these writers, then, Plutarch, Tzetzes, and his Scholi ast.
it would appear that the " Anabasis," or account of the expedition of Cyrus, was written by Xenophon, and published as the work of Themistogenes.
But from the passage of Xen­ ophon, to which we ought to attribute more authority than to any others as also from that of Suidas, we may rather conceive, as Dindorf suggests, that there were two Anabases, the one writ­ ten by Themistogenes, before Xenophon wrote the third book of the Hellenica, and to which Xenophon was then content to re­ fer, and the other written by Xenophon himself subsequently to that time.
Under this supposition, indeed, we must believe that Xenophon published the Anabasis at a very advanced period of life, while the composition seems to be that of a man in the full vigour of his faculties;
but Sophocles, as Kühner1 observes, wrote with great spirit, after he was eighty years of age;
and the Anabasis might have been written some years before Xenophon sent it out of his hands.
If there were two, that of Themistogenes, from what Xenophon says of it, may have brought the Greeks only to the sea, or to Trebisond ;
that of Xenophon is continued to their junction with Thibron.
If there were but one, Xenophon may have published the first four books, at an earlier period, under the name of Themisto­ genes, and have afterwards added the three other books, and signified that the whole was his own.
One object of the author of the work which we have, observes Mitford,2 was to apologize for the conduct of Xeno­ phon ;
in the latter part the narrative is constantly accom­ panied with a studied defence of his proceedings;
the cir­ cumstances that produced his banishment from Athens, and whatever might excite jealousy against him at Lacedæmon, have been carefully considered ;
if.
therefore,
Themistogenes wrote it, he may have written under the direction of Xeno­ phon ;
if Xenophon wrote it, there may have been good rea­ sons why, at the time of its publication, he should have wished it to pass under another person's name.
If there were two Anabases, we maysuppose that Xenophon’s superseded that of Themistogenes, and caused it to be lost.
The name of Themistogenes, as an author, is mentioned by no writer besides those whom we have noticed ;
while that of Xenophon, as the author of the Anabasis, is specified, as Mitford and Krüger 3 observe, by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Cicero, Diogenes Laertius, Lucian, Ælian, and Athe- næus, besides the grammarians and lexicographers, Hesychius, Pollux, Harpocration, and Ammonius.
But no decisive opinion can be pronounced.
The statement of Plutarch, which he gives, not as a conjecture of his own but as a matter of general belief in his day, and which is sup­ ported by Tzetzes and his Scholiast, may induce many readers, if not the majority, to suppose, with Weiske1 and Kühner, that there was probably but one Anabasis, that which we now have, and which, though the work of Xenophon, was, for whatever reasons on the part of the author, sent into the world as the composition of Themistogenes.
The attractions of the subject, as Dr. Smith2 observes, might have induced more than one or two persons to write upon it.
Of the other work translated in this volume, no doubt has been expressed that Xenophon was the author.
It shows what were the habits and conversation of him who taught that To know That which before us lies in daily life
Is the prime wisdom ;
who brought philosophy down from heaven to dwell with men ;
and who was pronounced the wisest of men by the Delphic oracle, "because he judiciously made choice of human nature for the object of his thoughts, an inquiry into which a?
much exceeds all other learning, as it is of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measures of right and wrong, than to settle the distances of the planets, and compute the time of their circumvolutions.”3
His doctrine was,
On life, on morals, be thy thoughts employed;
Leave to the schools their Atoms and their Void.
He gave indeed, it may be thought, too little encourage­ ment to investigations in physical science.
How far he recommended that mathematical studies should be pursued, may be seen in B. iv. c. 7. The best specimen of Socratic reasoning in the Memorabilia is the philosopher’s conversa­ tion with Euthydemus in B. iv. c. 2.Parentage of Cyrus the Younger.
After the death of his father he is ac­ cused of plotting against his brother Artaxerxes, who imprisons him, but releases him on the intercession of his mother, and sends him back to his province, where he secretly collects forces, of which a large proportion are from Greece, to make war on his brother.
1.
OF Darius1 and Parysatis were born two sons,2 the elder Artaxerxes,3 and the younger Cyrus.
After Darius had fallen sick, and suspected that the end of his life was approach­ ing, he was desirous that both of his sons should attend him.
2. The elder then happened to be present;
Cyrus he sent for from the province of which he had made him satrap.
He had also appointed him commander of all the forces that muster in the plain of Castolus.
4Cyrus accordingly went up, taking with him Tissaphernes as a friend, and having also with him three hundred heavy-arm­ ed Greeks,' and Xenias of Parrhasia,2 their captain.
3.
But when Darius was dead, and Artaxerxes was placed upon the throne, Tissaphernes brought an accusation against Cyrus before his brother, saying that he was plotting against him.
Artaxerxes was induced to give credit to it, and had Cyrus arrested, with the intention of putting him to death;
but his mother, having begged his life, sent him back to his province.
4.
When Cyrus had departed, after being thus in danger and disgrace, he began to consider by what means he might cease to be subject to his brother, and make himself king, if he could, in his stead.
Parysatis, their mother, was well dis­ posed towards Cyrus,3 as she loved him better than Arta­ xerxes, who was on the throne.
5. Whatever messengers from the king4 came to visit him, he let none of them go till he had inclined them to be friends to himself, rather than the monarch.:
He also paid such attention to the Barbarians6 that were with him, that they were in a condition to take the field, and well inclined towards himself.
5. His Greek force he collected as secretly as he could, that he might surprise the king as little prepared as possible.
lie collected troops in the following manner.
Whatever garrisons he had in his towns, he sent orders to the com­ manders of them to procure respectively as many Peloponne­ sians as they could, of the best class of soldiers, on pretence that Tissaphernes was forming designs upon those towns.
For the cities of Ionia had formerly been under the govern­ ment of Tissaphernes, having been assigned to him by the king, but had at this time all revolted to Cyrus except Mile­ tus.
7. Tissaphernes, discovering that the people of Miletus were forming a similar design, [to go over to Cyrus,1] put some of them to death, and sent others into banishment.
Cy­ rus, receiving the exiles under his protection, and assembling an army, laid siege to Miletus by land and sea, and used every exertion to restore these exiles ;
and he had thus another pretext for augmenting the number of his forces.
8. He then sent to the king, and requested that, as he was his brother, these cities should be given to him rather than that Tissa­ phernes should govern them ;
and in this application his mother supported him.
Thus the king had no suspicion of the plot against him, but supposed that Cyrus, from being at war with Tissaphernes, was spending the money upon troops;
60 that he was not at all concerned at the strife between them, especially as Cyrus remitted to him the tribute arising from the cities which Tissaphernes had had.9.
Another army was collected for him in the Chersonesus opposite Abydos, in the following method.
Clearchus, a La­ cedæmonian, happened to be in exile.
Cyrus, having met with him, was struck with admiration for him, and made him a present of ten thousand darics.
2 Clearchus, on receiving the gold, raised, by means of it, a body of troops, and making ex­ cursions out of the Chersonesus, made war upon the Thracians that are situated above the Hellespont, and was of assist­ ance to the Greeks ;
so that the towns on the Hellespont willingly contributed money for the support of his men.
This too was a force thus secretly maintained for Cyrus.to.
Aristippus, also, a Thessalian, happened to be a guest- friend3 of Cyrus, and, being pressed by an adverse faction a home, came to him, and asked him for two thousand mercen­ ary troops, and three months’ pay for them, representing that he would thus be enabled to overpower his enemies.
Cyrus granted him four thousand, and six months’ pay, desiring him not to terminate the strife until he should consult him.
Thus another body of troops was clandestinely supported for him in Thessaly.
11.
He then requested Proxenus a Bœotian, who was also his guest-friend, to join him with as many men as he could procure, stating that he intended to make war on the Pisi­ dians, as they molested his territories.
He also desired Sophænetus of Stymphalus,' and Socrates, an Aehæan, both cf them his guest-friends, to come to him, and bring as many men as possible, pretending that lie was going to war with Tissaphernes on behalf of the Milesiam exiles ;
and they acted as he wished.
Cyrus begins his march, proceeding from Sardis through Lydia into Phry­ gia, where he is joined by new forces.
The city of Celænte;
the plain of Caystrus, where the soldiers demand their arrears of pay, which Cyrus discharges with money received from the queen of Cilicia.
The town of Thymbrium;
the fountain of Midas.
Cyrus enters Cilicia, and is met at Tarsus by Syennesis, the king of the country.
1.
WHEN it seemed to him time to march up into the coun­ try, he made it his pretext for doing so that be wished to expel the Pisidians entirely from the territory, and mustered, as if for the purpose of attacking them, the whole of the troops, as well Barbarian as Greek, that were on the spot.
2
He also sent word to Clearchus to join him, bringing whatever force was at his command;
and to Aristippus, as soon as he had come to terms with the party at home, to send him back the troops that he had.
He also desired Xenias the Arcadian, who commanded for him the mercenaries in the several towns, to bring him all his men except such as would be required to garrison the citadels.
2. He summoned, too, the army that was besieging Miletus, and invited the exiles to accompany him on his expedition;
promising them, that if lie success­ fully accomplished the objects for which lie undertook it, he would never rest till he had re-established them in their country.
They cheerfully consented, as they had confidence in him, and, taking their arms, joined him at Sardis.3.
To Sardis also came Xenias, bringing with him the troops from the several towns, to the number of four thousand heavy-armed men.
Thither came also Proxenus, with heavy- armed men to the number of fifteen hundred, and five hun­ dred light-armed;
Sophænetus the Stymphalian with a thou­ sand heavy-armed ;
Socrates the Achæan with five hundred ;
and Pasion.
of Megara with three hundred heavy-armed, and the same number of peltasts.
1 Both Pasion and Socrates were among those serving in the army at Miletus.4.
These joined him at Sardis.
Tissaphernes, observing these proceedings, and considering the force to be greater than was necessary to attack the Pisidians, set out, with all possi­ ble speed, to give notice of the matter to the king, taking with him about five hundred cavalry;
5. and the king, as soon as he heard from Tissaphernes of the preparations of Cyrus, made arrangements to oppose him.
Cyrus, at the head of the force which I have stated, com­ menced his journey from Sardis,2 and proceeded through Lydia, three days' march,1 a distance of twenty-two para­ sangs,2 as far as the river Mæander.
The breadth of this river is two plethra,3 and a bridge was thrown over it, con­ structed of seven boats.
6. Having crossed the stream, lie went forward through Phrygia, one day's march, eight para­ sangs, till he reached Colossæ, a populous city, wealthy and of considerable magnitude.
Here he halted seven days ;
when Menon the Thessalian joined him with a thousand heavy- armed troops and five hundred peltasts, consisting of Dolo­ pians, Ænianes, and Olynthians.
7.
Hence he proceeded in three days' march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to Celænæ, a populous, large, and rich city of Phrygia.
Here Cyrus had a palace, and an extensive park full of wild beasts, which he was accustomed to hunt on horseback whenever he wished to give himself and his horses exercise.
Through the middle of this park flows the river Mæander ;
its springs issue from the palace itself;
and it runs also through the city of Celænæ.
8. There is also at Celænæ a palace of the Great King,4 situated near the source of the river Marsyas, under the citadel.
This river too runs through the city, and falls into the Mæander.
The breadth of the Marsyas is twenty-five feet.
Here Apollo is said to have flayed Marsyas, after conquering him in a trial of musical skill, and to have hung up his skin in the cave, where the source of the stream rises:
and on this account the river is called the Marsyas.
9. Xerxes is said to have built both this palace and the citadel of Celænæ, when he was returning from Greece after his discomfiture in battle.
Cyrus remained here thirty days ;
during which time Cle­ archus, the Lacedæmonian exile, joined him with a thousand heavy-armed men, eight hundred Thracian peltasts, and two hundred Cretan archers.
At the same time Sosis1 of Syra­ cuse arrived with three hundred heavy-armed men, and So­ phænetus, an Arcadian, with a thousand.
Here Cyrus held a review of the Greeks in the park, and took their number;
and they were in all eleven thousand heavy-armed troops, and about two thousand peltasts.
2 10. Hence he proceeded two days' march, a distance of ten parasangs, to Peltæ, a well- peopled city, where he halted three days, during which Xenias the Arcadian celebrated the sacred rites of Lycæan Jove,3 and held public games on the occasion ;
in which the prizes were golden strigiles.
4 Cyrus was present at the games as a spectator.
Thence he proceeded, two days' march, twelve parasangs, to Ceramon Agora, a populous city, the last on the side of Mysia.11.
Hence he proceeded, in three days' march, the distance of thirty parasangs, to the Plain of Caystrus, a populous city.
Here he halted five days;
and at this time more than three months' pay was due to the troops, which they frequently went to his tent to demand.
Cyrus put them off, giving them hopes, but was evidently distressed;
for it was no part of his character not to pay when he had the means.
IS.
But while he was there, Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis king of the Cilicians, paid him a visit, and was said to have pre­ sented him with a large sum of money.
He in consequence gave the troops pay for four months.
The Cilician queen had with her a body-guard of Cilicians and Aspendians;
and it was reported that Cyrus had connexion with her.
13.
Hence he proceeded two days' march, ten parasangs, to Thymbrium, a populous city.
Here, by the road-side, was a fountain, called the fountain of Midas, king of Phrygia;
at which Midas is said to have captured the Satyr,' by mixing wine with the water.
14. Hence he proceeded, two days' march, ten parasangs, to Tyriæum, a well-peopled city, where he stayed three days.
The Cilician queen is said to have requested Cyrus to show her his army.
With the desire therefore of exhibiting it to her, he reviewed his troops, as well Greek as Barbarian, in the plain.
15. He ordered the Greeks to be marshalled, and to take their places, as they were accustomed to do for battle, each captain arranging his own men.
They were accordingly drawn up four deep ;
Menon and his troops took the right wing;
Clearchus and his men the left;
and the other captains occupied the centre.
16. First of all, then, Cyrus reviewed the Barbarians, who marched past him, drawn up in troops and companies ;
2 and afterwards the Greeks, riding by them in his chariot, with the Cilician queen in her car.
3
They had all brazen helmets, scarlet tunics, greaves, and polished shields.
17. When he had ridden past them all, lie stopped his chariot in front of their phalanx, and sent Pigres the interpreter to the Greek officers, with orders for them to present arms,4 and to advance with their whole phalanx.
The officers communicated these orders to their soldiers ;
and, when the trumpeter gave the signal, they presented arms and advanced.
Then, as they proceeded with a quicker pace and loud shouts, the soldiers of their own ac­ cord took to running, bearing down upon the tents of the Per­ sians.
is.
Upon this, there arose great terror among the rest of the Barbarians ;
the Cilician queen fled from her car ;
and he people in the market deserted their goods and took to their heels ;
while the Greeks marched up to the tents with laugh­ ter.
The Cilician queen, on beholding the splendour and dis­ cipline of the army, was struck with admiration;
and Cyrus was delighted when he saw the terror with which the Greeks inspired the Barbarians.
19.
Hence he advanced, three days' march, a distance of wenty parasangs, to Iconium, the last town ofPhrygia;
where lie halted three days.
He then went forward through Lycao­ nia, five days' march, a distance of thirty parasangs;
and this country, as being that of an enemy, he permitted the Greeks to ravage.
20.
From hence Cyrus despatched the Cilician queen, by the shortest road, into Cilicia ;
and sent with her the troops which Menon had.
and Menon himself.
Cyrus, with the rest of the army, proceeded through Cappadocia, four days' march, a dis­ tance of twenty-five parasangs, to Dana, a populous, large, and wealthy city.
Here he stayed three days;
in the course of which he put to death a Persian, named Megaphernes, a wearer of the royal purple,!
and a certain other person in power, one of the provincial governors having accused them of conspiring against him.
21.
They then made an attempt to enter Cilicia;
but the sole entrance was a road broad enough only for a single car­ riage, very steep, and impracticable for an army to pass, if any one opposed them.
Syennesis, besides, was said to be stationed on the heights, guarding the defile;
on which ac­ count Cyrus halted for a day in the plain.
The next day, a messenger came to inform him that Syennesis had quitted the heights, on receiving information that Menon's army was already in Cilicia within the mountains, and hearing that Tamos had a number of galleys, belonging to the Lacedæ­ monians and Cyrus himself, sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia.
22. Cyrus accordingly ascended the mountains without any opposition, and saw the tents in which the Cilicians kept guard.
Hence he descended into a large and beautiful plain, well watered, and abounding with all kinds of trees, as well as vines.
It also produced great quantities of sesamum, panic, millet,2 wheat, and barley.
A chain of hills, strong and high, encompasses it on all sides from sea to sea.
23. De­ scending through this plain, he proceeded, in four days' march, a distance of twenty-five parasangs, to Tarsus, a large and opulent city of Cilicia.
Here was the palace of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians ;
and through the midst of the city runs a river, called the Cydnus, the breadth of which is two plethra.
24. This city the inhabitants, with Syennesis, had deserted for a strong-hold upon the mountains, except those who kept shops.
3
Those also remained behind, who lived near the sea at Soli and at Issi.25.
Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, had arrived at Tarsus five days before Cyrus.
But in passing over the mountains which skirt the plain, two companies of Menon's troops had perished ;
some said that they had been cut to pieces by the Cilicians, while committing some depredations;
others, that being left behind, and unable to find the rest of the army or their road, they had been destroyed while wandering about.
They amounted to a hundred heavy-armed men.
26. When the rest of Menon's troops came up, full of resentment at the fate of their comrades, they plundered both the city of Tarsus and the pa­ lace in it.
Cyrus, on entering the city, sent for Syennesis to come to him;
but Syennesis answered, that he had never yet put himself in the power of one stronger than himself;
nor would he then consent to go to Cyrus, until his wife pre­ vailed upon him, and he received solemn assurances of safety.
27. Afterwards, when they had met, Syennesis gave Cyrus a large sum of money for the support of his army, and Cyrus in return presented him with such gifts as are held in estimation by a king, a horse with a golden bit, a golden chain and brace­ lets, and a golden scimitar and Persian robe.
He also engaged that his country should no more be plundered, and that he should receive back the captured slaves, if they anywhere met with them.
Cyras is forced to stay twenty days at Tarsus by a mutiny of the Greek sol­ diers, who, suspecting that they were led against the king, refuse to go farther, and offer violence to Clearchus, who endeavours to force them to proceed.
But being told by Cyrus that the expedition is directed against Abrocomas, and promised an increase of pay, they agree to continue their march.
1.
HERE Cyrus and the army remained twenty days ;
for the soldiers refused to proceed farther, as they now began to suspect that they were marching against the king, and said that they had not been hired for this purpose, Clearchus, first of all, endeavoured to compel his soldiers to proceed ;
but, as soon as he began to advance, they pelted him and his baggage-cattle with stones.
2. Clearchus, indeed, on this occasion, had a narrow escape of being stoned to death.
At length, when he saw that he should not be able to proceed by force, he called a meeting of his soldiers;
and at first, stand­ ing before them, he continued for some time to shed tears, while they, looking on, were struck with wonder, and re­ mained silent.
He then addressed them to this effect:
3. "
Wonder not, soldiers, that I feel distressed at the present occurrences;
for Cyrus engaged himself to me by ties of hospitality, and honoured me, when I was an exile from my country, both with other marks of esteem, and by presenting me with ten thousand darics.
On receiving this money, I did not treasure it up for my own use, or squander it in luxury, but spent it upon you.
4. First of all, I made war upon the Thracians, and, in the cause of Greece, and with your assistance, took vengeance upon them by expelling them from the Chersonesus, when they would have taken the coun­ try from its Grecian colonists.
When Cyrus summoned me, I set out to join him, taking you with me, that if he had need of my aid, I might do him service in return for the benefits that I had received from him.
5. But since you are unwill­ ing to accompany him on this expedition, I am under the ob­ ligation, either, by deserting you, to preserve the friendship of Cyrus, or, by proving false to him, to adhere to you.
Whether I shall do right, I do not know ;
but I shall give you the pre­ ference, and will undergo with you whatever may be neces­ sary.
Nor shall any one ever say, that, after leading Greeks into a country of Barbarians, I deserted the Greeks, and adopted, in preference, the friendship of the Barbarians.
6. " Since, however, you decline to obey me, or to follow me, I will go with you, and submit to whatever may be des­ tined for us.
For I look upon you to be at once my country, my friends, and my fellow-soldiers, and consider that with you I shall be respected, wherever I may be:
but that, if separated from you, I shall be unable either to afford assistance to a friend, or to avenge myself upon an enemy.
Feel assured, therefore, that I am resolved to accompany you wherever you go.
"7. Thus he spoke;
and the soldiers, as well those under his own command as the others, on hearing these assur­ ances, applauded him for saying that he would not march against the king;
and more than two thousand of the troops of Xenias and Pasion, taking with them their arms and baggage, went and encamped under Clearchus.8.
Cyrus, perplexed and grieved at these occurrences, sent for Clearchus;
who, however, would not go, but sending a messenger to Cyrus without the knowledge of the soldiers, bade him be of good courage, as these matters would be ar­ ranged to his satisfaction.
He also desired Cyrus to send for him again, but, when Cyrus had done so, he again declined to go.
1 9. Afterwards, having assembled his own soldiers, and those who had recently gone over to him, and any of the rest that wished to be present, he spoke to the following effect:
"It is evident, soldiers, that the situation of Cyrus with regard to us is the same as ours with regard to him ;
for we are no longer his soldiers, since we refuse to follow him, nor is he any longer our paymaster.
10. That he considers himself wronged by us, however, I am well aware;
so that, even when he sends for me, I am unwilling to go to him, princi­ pally from feeling shame, because I am conscious of having been in all respects false to him ;
and in addition, from being afraid, that, when he has me in his power, he may take venge­ ance on me for the matters in which he conceives that he has been injured.
11. This, therefore, seems to me to be no time for us to sleep, or to neglect our own safety;
but, on the contrary, to consider what we must do under these circum­ stances.
2
As long as we remain here, it seems necessary to consider how we may best remain with safety;
or, if we de­ termine upon going at once, how we may depart with the greatest security, and how we may obtain provisions;
for without these, the general and the private soldier are alike inefficient.
3 12. Cyrus is indeed a most valuable friend to those to whom he is a friend, but a most violent enemy to those to whom he is an enemy.
lie has forces, too, both in­ fantry and cavalry, as well as a naval power, as we all alike see and know;
for we seem to me to be encamped at no great distance from him.
It is therefore full time to say whatever any one thinks to be best."
Having spoken thus, he made a pause.
13. Upon this, several rose to speak;
some, of their own accord, to express what they thought;
others, previously in­ structed by Clearchus, to point out what difficulty there would be, either in remaining or departing, without the con- sent of Cyrus.
14. One of these, pretending to be eager to proceed with all possible haste to Greece, proposed that they should choose other commanders without delay, if Clearchus were unwilling to conduct them back;
that they should pur­ chase provisions, as there was a market in the Barbarian camp, and pack up their baggage;
that they should go to Cyrus, and ask him to furnish them with ships, in which they might sail home ;
and, if he should not grant them, that they should beg of him a guide, to conduct them back through such parts of the country as were friendly towards them.
But if he would not even allow them a guide, that they should, without delay, form themselves in warlike order, and send a detachment to take possession of the heights, in order that neither Cyrus nor the Cilicians, (" of whom," said he, "we have many prisoners, and much money that we have taker.,") may be the first to occupy them.
Such were the suggestions that he offered;
but after him Clearchus spoke as follows:
15.
"Let no one of you mention me, as likely to undertake this command ;
for I see many reasons why I ought not to do so;
but be assured, that whatever person you may elect, I shall pay the greatest possible deference to him, that you may see that I know how to obey as well as any other man."16.
After him another arose, who pointed out the folly of him who advised them to ask for ships, just as if Cyrus were not about to sail back,2 and who showed, too, how foolish it would be to request a guide of the very person “ whose plans," said he, “ we are frustrating.
And," he added, “ if we should trust the guide that Cyrus might assign us, what will hinder Cyrus from giving orders to occupy the heights before we reach them ?
17. For my own part, I should be reluctant to embark in any vessel that he might grant us, lest he should send us and the galleys to the bottom together;
I should also be afraid to follow any guide that he may ap­ point, lest he should conduct us into places, from whence there would be no means of escape;
and I had rather, if I depart without the consent of Cyrus, depart without his knowledge;
but this is impossible.
18. I say then that such proposals are absurdities;
and my advice is, that certain per­ sons, such as are fit for the task, should accompany Clearchus to Cyrus, and ask him in what service he wishes to employ us;
and if the undertaking be similar to that in which he be­ fore employed foreign troops, 1 that we too should follow him, and not appear more cowardly than those who previously went up with him.
19. But if the present design seem greater and more difficult and more perilous than the former, that they should ask him, in that case, either to induce us to accom­ pany him by persuasion, or, yielding himself to our persuasions, to give us a passage to a friendly country;
for thus, if we accompany him, we shall accompany him as friends and zeal­ ous supporters, and if we leave him, we shall depart in safety ;
that they then report to us what answer he makes to this application ;
and that we, having heard his reply, take measures in accordance with it."20.
These suggestions were approved ;
and, having chosen certain persons, they sent them with Clearchus to ask Cyrus the questions agreed upon by the army.
Cyrus answered, that he had heard that Abrocomas, an enemy of his, was on the banks of the Euphrates, twelve days' march distant;
and it was against him, he said, that lie wished to march ;
and if Abrocomas should be there, he said that he longed to take due vengeance on him ;
but if he should retreat, “ we will con­ sider there," he added, " how to proceed."21. The delegates, having heard this answer, reported it to the soldiers, who had still a suspicion that he was leading them against the king, but nevertheless resolved to accompany him.
They then asked for an increase of pay, and Cyrus promised to give them all half as much again as they received before, that is to say, instead of a daric, three half-darics a month for every soldier.
But no one heard there, at least publicly, that he was leading them against the king.
The army reaches Issi, the last city in Cilicia, at which the fleet then ar­ rives.
Cyrus proceeds into Syria, where two of the Greek captains, Xenias and Pasion, desert the expedition ;
the good feeling of Cyrus, in forbearing to pursue them, renders the other Greeks more willing to ac­ company him.
He arrives at Thapsacus on the Euphrates, where he dis­ closes the real object of his expedition to the Greek troops, who express discontent, but are induced by fresh promises, and the example of Menon, to cross the river.
1.
HENCE he proceeded, two days' march, a distance of ten parasangs, to the river Psarus, the breadth of which was three plethra.
He then went forward, one day's march, five para­ sangs, to the river Pyramus, the breadth of which is a sta­ dium.
Hence he advanced in two days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to Issi, the last city in Cilicia, situate upon the sea-coast, a populous, large, and rich place.
2.
Here Cyrus remained three days, in which time the ships from Peloponnesus, thirty-five in number, arrived, Pythagoras the Lacedæmonian being their commander.
But Tamos, an Egyptian, had conducted the fleet from Ephesus, who had also with him five-and-twenty other ships, belonging to Cyrus, with which he had blockaded Miletus when it was in the in­ terest of Tissaphernes, and had fought against him on behalf of Cyrus.
3. In these vessels came also Cheirisophus the Lacedaemoniam, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and who had with him seven hundred heavy-armed troops, which he commanded as part of the army of Cyrus.
The ships were moored opposite Cyrus's tent.
Here, too, the Greek mercen­ aries, who were in the pay of Abrocomas, four hundred heavy-armed men, deserted him and came over to Cyrus, and joined in the expedition against the king.
4.
Hence he proceeded, one day's march, five parasangs, to the Gates of Cilicia and Syria.
These were two fortresses;
of the part within them, towards Cilicia, Syennesis and a guard of Cilicians had the charge;
the part without, towards Syria, a garrison of the king's soldiers was reported to oc­ cupy.
Between the two runs a river, called Carsus, a plelh­ rum in breadth.
The whole space between the fortresses was three stadia;
and it was impossible to pass it by force ;
for the passage was very narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, and above were inaccessible rocks.
At each of the fortresses were gates.
5. It was on account of this passage that Cyrus had sent for the fleet, that he might disembark heavy-armed troops within and without the Gates,1 who might force a pass­ age through the enemy, if they still kept guard at the Syrian gates ;
a post which lie expected Abrocomas would hold, as he had under his command a numerous army.
Abrocomas however did not attempt this ;
but, when he heard that Cyrus was in Cilicia, retreated out of Phœnicia, and proceeded to join the king, having with him, as was said, three hundred thousand men.6.
Hence he proceeded through Syria, one day's march, five parasangs, to Myriandrus, a city near the sea, inhabited by Phoenicians ;
this place was a public mart, and many merchant-vessels lay at anchor there.
7. Here they remained seven days ;
and here Xenias the Arcadian captain, and Pasion the Megarean, embarking in a vessel, and putting on board their most valuable effects, sailed away;
being actu­ ated, as most thought, by motives of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to retain under his command their sol­ diers, who had seceded to Clearchus in the expectation of re­ turning to Greece, and not of marching against the king Upon their disappearance, a rumour pervaded the army that Cyrus would pursue them with ships of war;
and some wished that they might be taken, as having acted per­ fidiously;
while others pitied their fate, if they should be caught.
8.
But Cyrus, calling together the captains, said to them, " Xenias and Pasion have left us:
but let them be well as­ sured, that they have not fled clandestinely;
for I know which way they are gone;
nor have they escaped beyond my reach ;
for I have triremes that would overtake their vessel.
But, by the gods, I shall certainly not pursue them ;
nor shall any one say, that as long as a man remains with me, I make use of his services, but that, when he desires to leave me, I seize and ill-treat his person, and despoil him of his property.
But let them go, with the consciousness that they have acted a worse part towards us than we towards them.
I have, in­ deed, their children and wives under guard at Tralles;
but iit even of them shall they be deprived, but shall receive them back in consideration of their former service to me.
"9. Thus Cyrus spoke;
and the Greeks, even such as had been previously disinclined to the expedition, when they heard of the noble conduct of Cyrus, accompanied him with greater pleasure and alacrity.
After these occurrences, Cyrus proceeded four days' march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Clialus, which is a plethrum in breadth, and full of large tame fish, which the Syrians looked upon as gods, and allowed no one to hurt either them or the pigeons.
The villages, in which they fixed their quarters, belonged to Parysatis, having been given her for her girdle.!10.
Thence he advanced, five days' march, a distance of thirty parasangs, to the source of the river Dardes, which is a plethrum in breadth.
Here was the palace of Belesys, the governor of Syria, and a very large and beautiful garden, con­ taining all that the seasons produce.
But Cyrus laid it waste, and burned the palace.
11. Hence he proceeded, three days' march, a. distance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which is there four stadia in breadth, and on which is situated a large and rich city, named Thapsacus.
The army remained there five days ;
and Cyrus sent for the Greek captains, and told them, that his march was directed to Babylon, against the Great King;
and he desired them to make this announcement to the sol.
diers, and to persuade them to accompany him.
12. The leaders, assembling their troops, communicated this information to them ;
and the soldiers expressed them­ selves much displeased with their officers, and said that they had long known this, but concealed it;
and they refused to go, unless such a donative was granted them, as had been given to those who had before gone up with Cyrus to his father, and that, too, when they did not go to fight, but merely attended Cyrus when his father summoned him.
13. This state of things the generals reported to Cyrus;
who in consequence promised to give every man five minæ of silver,1 when they should arrive at Babylon, and their full pay be­ sides, until he should bring back the Greeks to Ionia again.
The greatest part of the Grecian force was thus prevailed upon to accompany him.
But before it was certain what the other soldiers would do, whether they would accompany Cyrus or not, Menon assembled his own troops apart from the rest, and spoke as follows:
14.
“ If you will follow my advice, soldiers, you will, with­ out incurring either danger or toil, make yourselves honoured by Cyrus beyond the rest of the army.
What, then, would I have you do?
Cyrus is at this moment urgent with the Greeks to accompany him against the king ;
I therefore sug­ gest that, before it is known how the other Greeks will an­ swer Cyrus, you should cross over the river Euphrates.
15. For if they should determine upon accompanying him, you will appear to have been the cause of it, by being the first to pass the river;
and to you, as being most forward with your services, Cyrus will feel and repay the obligation, as no one knows how to do better than himself.
But if the others should determine not to go with him, we shall all of us return back again ;
but you, as having alone complied with his wishes, and as being most worthy of his confidence, he will employ in garrison duty and posts of authority;
and whatever else you may ask of him, I feel assured that, as the friends of Cyrus, you will obtain it."16.
On hearing these proposals, they at once complied with them, and crossed the river before the others had given their answer.
And when Cyrus perceived that they had crossed, he was much pleased, and despatched Glus to Menon's troops with this message:
" I applaud your conduct, my friends;
and it shall be my care that you may applaud me ;
or think me no longer Cyrus.”
17. The soldiers, in consequence, being filled with great expectations, prayed that he might succeed;
and to Menon Cyrus was said to have sent most magnifi­ cent presents.
After these transactions, he passed the river, and all the rest of the army followed him ;
and, in crossing the stream, no one was wetted by its waters above the breast.
18. The people of Thapsacus said, that this river had never, ex­ cept on that occasion, been passable on foot, but only by means of boats;
which Abrocomas, going before, had burnt, that Cyrus might not be able to cross.
It seemed, therefore, that this had happened by divine interposition, and that the river had plainly made way for Cyrus as the future king.
19.
Hence he advanced through Syria, nine days' march, a distance of fifty parasangs, and arrived at the rier Araxes, where were a number of villages, stored with corn and wine.
Here the army remained three days, and collected provisions.
the eriny proceeds through Arabia, having the Euphrates on the right.
They suffer from want of provisions, and many of the beasts of burden perish ;
but supplies are procured from the opposite bank of the Eu­ phrates.
A dispute occurs between Clearchus and Menon, which is quelled by Cyrus.1.
CYRUS now advanced through Arabia, having the Eu­ phrates on his right, five days' march through the desert, a distance of thirty-five parasangs.
In this region the ground was entirely a plain, level as the sea.
It was cover,,-! with wormwood, and whatever other kinds of shrub or reed grew on it, were all odoriferous as perfumes.
But there were no trees.
2. There were wild animals, however, of various kinds ;
the most numerous were wild asses;
there were also many ostriches, as well as bustards and antelopes ;
and these ani­ mals the horsemen of the army sometimes hunted.
The wild asses, when anyone pursued them, would start forward a con­ siderable distance, and then stand still;
(for they ran much more swiftly than the horse ;
) and again, when the horse ap­ proached, they did the same;
and it was impossible to catch them, unless the horsemen, stationing themselves at intervals, kept up the pursuit with a succession of horses.
The flesh of those that were taken resembled venison, but was more ten­ der.
3. An ostrich no one succeeded in catching ;
and those horsemen who hunted that bird, soon desisted from the pur­ suit;
for it far outstripped1 them in its flight, using its feet for running, and its wings, raising them like a sail.
2
The bustards might be taken, if a person started them suddenly;
for they fly but a short distance, like partridges, and soon tire.
Their flesh was very delicious.
4. Marching through this region, they came to the river Mascas, the breadth of which is a plethrum.
Here was a large deserted city, of which the name was Corsote, and which was entirely surrounded by the Mascas.
Here they stayed three days, and furnished themselves with provisions.
5.
Thence he proceeded, thirteen days' march through the desert, a distance of ninety parasangs, still keeping the Euphrates on the right, and arrived at a place called the Gates.3
In this march many of the beasts of burden perished of hunger ;
for there was neither grass, nor any sort of tree, but the whole country was completely bare.
The inhabitants, who quarried and fashioned millstones near the river, took them to Babylon, and sold them, and lived upon corn which they bought with the money.
6. Corn, too, failed the army, and it was not possible to buy any, except in the Lydian market among Cyrus's Barbarian troops, where they pur­ chased a capithe1 of wheat-flour or barley-meal for four sigH.
The siglus is equivalent to seven Attic oboli and a half,2 and the capithe contains two Attic chœnices.
The soldiers therefore lived entirely upon flesh.
7. There were some of these marches which he made ex­ tremely long, whenever he wished to get to water or forage.
On one occasion, when a narrow and muddy road presented itself, almost impassable for the waggons, Cyrus halted on the spot with the most distinguished and wealthy of his train, and ordered Glus and Pigres, with a detachment of the Bar­ barian forces, to assist in extricating the waggons.
8. But as they appeared to him to do this too tardily, lie ordered, as if in anger, the noblest Persians of his suite to assist in ex­ pediting the carriages.
Then might be seen a specimen of their ready obedience;
for, throwing off their purple cloaks, in the place where each happened to be standing, they rushed forward, as one would run in a race for victory, down an ex­ tremely steep declivity, having on those rich vests which they wear, and embroidered trowsers, some too with chains about their necks and bracelets on their wrists, and, leaping with these equipments straight into the mud, brought the waggons up quicker than any one would have imagined.
9.
On the whole, Cyrus evidently used the greatest speed throughout the march, and made no delay, except where he halted in order to obtain a supply of provisions, or for some other necessary purpose;
thinking that the quicker he went, the more unprepared he should find the king when lie engaged him, and that the more slowly he proceeded, the more numerous would be the force collected by the kins, And an attentive observer might see that the empire of the king was strong indeed in extent of territory and number of inhabitants, but weak through the length of the roads, and the dispersion of its forces, if an enemy invaded it with rapid movements.
to.
On the other side of the Euphrates, over against their course through the desert, was an opulent and extensive city, called Charmande ;
from this place the soldiers purchased provisions, crossing the river on rafts in the following manner.
They filled the skins, which they had for the coverings of their tents,1 with dry hay, and then closed and stitched them together, so that the water could not touch the hay.
Upon these they went across, and procured necessaries, such as wine made of the fruit of the palm-tree, and panic2 corn ;
for this was most plentiful in those parts.
11. Here the soldiers of Menon and those of Clearchus falling into a dispute about something, Clearchus, judging a soldier of Menon's to be in the wrong, inflicted stripes upon him, and the man, coming to the quarters of his own troops, told his comrades what had occurred, who, when they heard it, showed great displeasure and resentment towards Clearchus.
12. On the same day, Clearchus, after going to the place where the river was crossed, and inspecting the market there, was returning on horseback to his tent through Menon's camp, with a few attendants.
Cyrus had not yet arrived, but was still on his way thither.
One of Menon's soldiers, who was employed in cleaving wood, when he saw Clearchus riding through the camp, threw his axe at him, but missed his aim ;
another then threw a stone at him, and another, and afterwards several, a great uproar ensuing.
13. Clearchus sought refuge in his own camp, and immediately called his men to arms, ordering his heavy-armed troops to remain on the spot, resting their shields against their knees, while he himself, with the Thracians, and the horse- men that were in his camp, to the number of more than forty, (and most of these were Thracians,) bore down towards the troops of Menon, so that they and Menon himself were struck with terror, and made a general rush to their arms;
while some stood still, not knowing how to act under the circum­ stances.
14. Proxenus happened then to be coming up be­ hind the rest, with a body of heavy-armed men following him, and immediately led his troops into the middle space be­ tween them both, and drew them up under arms, begging Clearchus to desist from what he was doing.
But Clearchus was indignant, because, when he had narrowly escaped stoning, Proxenus spoke mildly of the treatment that he had received;
he accordingly desired him to stand out from between them.
15.
At this juncture Cyrus came up, and inquired into the, affair.
He then instantly took his javelins in his hand, and rode, with such of his confidential officers as were with him, into the midst of the Greeks, and addressed them thus:
16.
“Clearchus and Proxenus, and you other Greeks who are here present, you know not what you are doing.
For if you engage in any contention with one another, be assured, that this very day I shall be cut off, and you also not long after me ;
since, if our affairs go ill, all these Barbarians, whom you see before you, will prove more dangerous enemies to us than even those who are with the king."
IT.
Clearchus, on hear­ ing these remonstrances, recovered his self-possession;
and both parties, desisting from the strife, deposited their arms in their respective encampments.
Traces of the king's troops are perceived.
Orontes, a Persian nol leman, a re­ lation of Cyrus, offers to go forward with a body of cavalry, and lay an ambush for the king's army.
Before he sets out, however, he is found to be in correspondence with the king, and is put to death.
1.
As they advanced from this place, the footsteps and dung of horses were observed, and the track was conjectured to be that of about two thousand cavalry.
These, as they went be­ fore, had burnt all the fodder, and whatever else might have been of use to Cyrus.
And here Orontes, a Persian, by birth connected with the king, and reckoned one of the ablest of the Persians in the field, turned traitor to Cyrus;
with whom, indeed, he had previously been at strife, but had been reconciled to him.
2. He now told Cyrus, that if he would give him a thousand horse, he would either cut off, by lying in ambush, the body of cavalry that were burning all before them, or would take the greater number of them prisoners, and hinder them from consuming everything in their way, and prevent them from ever informing the king that they had seen the army of Cyrus.
Cyrus, when he heard his proposal, thought it advantageous;
and desired him to take a certain number of men from each of the different commanders.
3.
Orontes, thinking that lie had secured the cavalry, wrote a letter to the king, saying that he would come to him with as many horse as he could obtain ;
and he de­ sired him to give directions to his own cavalry to receive him as a friend.
There were also in the letter expressions reminding the king of his former friendship and fidelity to him.
This letter he gave to a man, upon whom, as he believed, he could depend, but who, when he received it, carried it to Cyrus.
4. Cyrus, after reading the letter, caused Orontes to be arrested, and summoned to his own tent seven of the most distinguished Persians of his staff, and de­ sired the Greek generals to bring up a body of heavy-armed men, who should arrange themselves under arms around his tent.
They did as he desired, and brought with them about three thousand heavy-armed soldiers.
5. Clearchus he called in to assist at the council, as that officer appeared, both to him­ self and to the rest, to be held most in honour among the Greeks.
Afterwards, when Clearchus left the council, he re­ lated to his friends how the trial of Orontes was conducted ;
for there was no injunction of secrecy.
He said, that Cyrus thus opened the proceedings :
6. "
I have solicited your attendance, my friends, in order that, on consulting with you, I may do, with regard to Orontes here before you, whatever may be thought just before gods and men.
In the first place, then, my father appointed him to be subject to me.
And when afterwards, by the command, as he himself states, of my brother, he engaged in war against me, having possession of the citadel of Sardis, I, too, took up arms against him, and made him resolve to desist from war with me;
and then I received from him, and gave turn in return, the right-hand of friendship.
7. And since that occurrence," lie continued, "is there anything in which I have wronged you? "
Orontes replied that there was not.
Cyrus again asked him, "And did you not then subsequently, when, as you own yourself, you had received no injury from me, go over to the Mysians, and do all the mischief in your power to my territories?"
Orontes answered in the affirmative. "
And did you not then," continued Cyrus, " when you had thus again proved your strength, come to the altar of Diana, and say that you repented, and, prevailing upon me by entreaties, give me, and receive from me in return, pledges of mutual faith?"
This, too, Orontes acknowledged.
8. "What in­ jury, then," continued Cyrus, "have you received from me, that you are now, for the third time, discovered in traitorous designs against me ? " Orontes saying that he had received no injury from him, Cyrus asked him, "You confess, then, that you have acted unjustly towards me ?" " I am necessi­ tated to confess it," replied Orontes.
Cyrus then again in­ quired, "
And would you yet become an enemy to my brother, and a faithful friend to me ? "
Orontes answered, " Though I should become so, 0 Cyrus, I should no longer appear so to you."
9. On this, Cyrus said to those present, " Such are this man's deeds, and such his confessions.
And now, do you first, 0 Clearchus, declare your opinion, whatever seems right to you."
Clearchus spoke thus :
"
I advise, that this man be put out of the way with all despatch ;
that so it may be no longer necessary to be on our guard against him, but that we may have leisure, as far as he is concerned, to benefit those who are willing to be our friends." to.
In this opinion, Clearchus said, the rest concurred.
Afterwards, by the direction of Cyrus, all of them, even those related to the prisoner, rising from their seats, took Orontes by the girdle,1 in token that he was to suffer death;
when those to whom directions had been given, led him away.
And when those saw turn pass, who had previously been used to bow before him, they bowed be­ fore him as usual, though they knew that he was being led to execution.
11.
After he had been conducted into the tent of Artapatas, the most confidential of Cyrus's sceptre-bearers,1 no one from that time ever beheld Orontes either living or dead, nor couti any one say, from certain knowledge, in what manner he died.
Various conjectures were made;
but no burial-place of him was ever seen.
Cyrus enters Babylonia, and reviews his troops;
he addresses the Greeks, and promises them great rewards in ease of victory.
He advances in order of battle, but afterwards, supposing that his brother had no immediate intention to engage, proceeds with less caution.
1. HENCE Cyrus proceeded through Babylonia, three days' march, a distance of twelve parasangs;
and at the end of the third day's march, he reviewed his army, both Greeks and Barbarians, in the plain, about midnight;
for lie expected that with the ensuing dawn the king would come up with his army to offer him battle.
He desired Clearchus to take the command of the right wing, and Menon the Thessalian that of the left, while he himself drew up his own troops.
2.
After the review, at the dawn of day, some deserters from the Great King came and gave Cyrus information respecting the royal army.
Cyrus, assembling the generals and captains of the Greeks, consulted with them how he should conduct the engagement, and then encouraged them with the following exhortations:
3. " It is not, 0 Greeks, from any want of Bar­ barian farces, that I take yon with me as auxiliaries ;
but it is because I think you more efficient and valuable than a multi­ tude of Barbarians, that I have engaged you in my service.
See, then, that you prove yourselves worthy of the liberty of which you are possessed, and for which I esteem you fortunate ;
for be well assured, that I should prefer that freedom to all that I possess, and to other possessions many times as great.
4.
But, that you may know to what sort of encounter you are advancing, I, from my own experience, will inform you.
The enemy's numbers are immense, and they make their onset with a loud shout;
but if you are firm against this, I feel ashamed to think what sort of men, in other respects, you will find those in the country to be.
But if you are true men, and prove yourselves stout-hearted, I will enable those of yon, who may wish to go home, to return thither the envy of their fellow- countrymen ;
but I think that I shall induce most of you to prefer the advantages of remaining with me to those in your own country.
"5. Upon this, Gaulites, an exile from Samos, a man in the confidence of Cyrus, being present, said, " Yet some say, O Cyrus, that you make many promises now, because you are in such a situation of approaching danger;
but that if things should turn out well, you will not remember them;
1 and some, too, say, that even if you have both the memory and the will, you will not have the power of bestowing all that you promise."
6. Hearing this, Cyrus said, " We have before us, my friends, the empire that was my father's, extending, on the south, to the parts where men cannot live for heat;
and on the north, to the parts where they cannot live for cold ;
and over all that lies between these extremes, the friends of my brother are now satraps.
7. But if we conquer, it will be proper for us to make our own friends masters of these regions.
So that it is not this that I fear, that I shall not have enough to give to each of my friends, if things turn out successfully, but that I shall not have friends enough to whom I may give it.
And to each of you Greeks, I will also give a golden crown.
"8. The Greeks who were present, when they heard these as surances, were much encouraged, and reported what he had said to the rest.
The captains, too, and some others of the Greeks, went into his tent, desiring to know for certain what would be their reward if they should be victorious;
and he did not let them go without satisfying the minds of all.
9.
But all, who conversed with him, urged him not to en­ gage in the battle personally, but take his station behind their line.
About this time, also, Clearchus put a question to Cyrus to this effect:
" And do you think, Cyrus, that your brother will come to battle with you ? " " By Jupiter," replied Cyrus, "if he be indeed the son of Darius and Parysatis, and my brother, I shall not gain possession of these dominions without a struggle."10.
In mustering the Greeks under arms, their numbers were found to be ten thousand four hundred heavy-armed men, and two thousand four hundred peltasts ;
of Barbarian troops under Cyrus, there were one hundred thousand, with about twenty chariots armed with scythes.
11.
Of the enemy the number was said to be one million two hundred thousand, with two hundred scythed chariots.
There were, besides, six thousand cavalry, of whom Artagerses had the command;
these were drawn up in front of the king himself.
12. Of the royal army there were four command­ ers, or generals, or leaders,1 each over three hundred thou­ sand men ;
that is to say, Abroeomas, Tissaphernes, Gobryas, and Arbaces.
But of this number only nine hundred thousand were present at the battle, and one hundred and fifty seythed chariots;
for Abrocomas, who was marching from Phœnicia, did not arrive till five days after the battle.
13.
This information was brought to Cyrus by some of the enemy who deserted from the Great King before the battle:
and such of the enemy as were taken prisoners after the bat­ tle gave the same account.
14.
Hence Cyrus proceeded one day's march, a distance of three parasangs, with all his forces, as well Greek as Barba­ rian, drawn up in order of battle;
for he expected that on this day the king would give him battle;
as about the middle of the day's march, there was a deep trench dug;
the breadth of it was five fathoms,2 and the depth three.
15. This ditch extended up through the plain, to the distance of twelve para­ gangs, as far as the wall of Media.
3
Here are the canals which are supplied from the river Tigris ;
1 there are four or them, each a plethrum in breadth, and very deep ;
boats employed in con­ veying corn sail along them.
They discharge themselves into the Euphrates, are distant from each other one parasang, and there are bridges over them.
Near the Euphrates was a nar­ row passage between the river and the trench, about twenty feet in breadth.
16. This trench the Great King had made to serve as a defence, when he heard that Cyrus was march­ ing against him.
By this passage Cyrus and his army made their way, and got within the trench.
17. On this day the king did not come to an engagement, but there were to be seen many traces of men and horses in retreat.
IS.
Cyrus sent for Silanus, the Ambracian soothsayer, and gave him three thousand darics,2 because, on the eleventh day previous, while sacrificing, he had told Cyrus that the king would not fight for ten days;
when Cyrus exclaimed, " He will not then fight at all, if he does not fight within that time;
but if you shall prove to have spoken truly, I promise to give you ten talents."
This money, therefore, he now paid him, the ten days having elapsed.
19.
As the king made no attempt, at the trench, to prevent the passage of Cyrus's army, it was thought both by Cyrus and the rest that he had given up the intention of fighting ;
so that on the day following Cyrus proceeded on his march with less caution.
20. On the day succeeding that, he pursued his journey seated in his chariot, and having but a small body of troops in line before him ;
While the far greater part of the army observed no order on their march, and many of the soldiers' arms were carried on the waggons and beasts of burden.
The enemy are seen advancing in order of battle, and the army of Cyrus hastily prepare for action.
The Greeks, in the right wing, put to flight the troops opposed to them, and pursue them some distance.
Cyrus, in the centre, directs his attack against the king, and is killed.

IT was now about the time of full market,1 and the station, where he intended to halt, was not far off, when Pategyas, a Persian, one of Cyrus's confidential adherents, made his appearance, riding at his utmost speed, with his horse in a sweat, and straightway called out to all whom he met, both in Persian and Greek, " that the king was approach­ ing with a vast army, prepared as for battle."
2. Immediately great confusion ensued ;
for the Greeks and all the rest ima­ gined that he would fall upon them suddenly, before they could form their ranks;
3. and Cyrus, leaping from his chariot, put on his breastplate, and, mounting his horse, took his javelin in his hand, and gave orders for all the rest to arm themselves, and to take their stations each in his own place.
4. They accordingly formed with all expedition ;
Clearchus occupying the extremity of the right wing close to the Euphrates, Prox­ enus being next to him, and after him the other captains in succession.
Menon and his troops occupied the left wing of the Greeks.5.
Of the Barbarian forces, about one thousand Paphlago.
nian cavalry were stationed near Clearchus, and the Grecian peltasts on the right;
and on the left was Ariæus, Cyrus's lieutenant, with the rest of the Barbarian troops.
6. In the centre2 was Cyrus, and with him about six hundred cavalry, the men all armed with breastplates, defences for the thighs, and helmets, except Cyrus alone ;
for Cyrus presented him­ self for battle with his head unprotected.
[It is said, too, that the other Persians expose themselves in battle with their heads uncovered.]
17. All the horses of the cavalry, that were with Cyrus, had defensive armour on the forehead and breast;
and the horse­ men had also Grecian swords.
8.
It was now mid-day, and the enemy was not yet in sight.
But when it was afternoon,2 there appeared a dust, like a white cloud, and not long after, a sort of blackness, extending to a great distance over the plain.
Presently, as they ap.
preached nearer, brazen armour began to flash, and the spears and ranks became visible.
9. There was a body of cavalry, in white armour, on the left of the enemy's line ;
(Tissa­ phernes was said to have the command of them ;
) close by these were troops with wicker shields;
and next to them, heavy-armed soldiers with long wooden shields reaching to their feet;
(these were said to be Egyptians;
) then other cavalry and bowmen.
These all marched according to their nations, each nation separately in a solid oblong.
3 10. In front of their line.
at considerable intervals from each other, were stationed the chariots called scythed chariots;
they had scythes projecting obliquely from the axletree, and others un- der the driver's seat, pointing to the earth, for the purpose of cutting through whatever came in their way;
and the design of them was to penetrate and divide the ranks of the Greeks.
11.
As to what Cyrus had said, however, when, on calling together the Greeks, he exhorted them to sustain unmoved the shout of the Barbarians, he was in this respect deceived;
for they now approached, not with a shout, but with all pos­ sible silence, and quietly, with an even and slow step.
12. Cyrus in the mean time, riding by with Pigres the interpreter, and three or four others, called out to Clearchus to lead his troops against the enemy's centre, for that there was the king ;
" and if," said he, "we are victorious in that quarter, our ob­ ject is fully accomplished."
13. But though Clearchus saw that close collection of troops in the centre of the enemy's line, and heard from Cyrus that the king was beyond the left of the Greeks, (for so much the superior was the king in numbers, that, while occupying the middle of his own line, he was still beyond Cyrus's left,) nevertheless he was unwill­ ing to draw off his right wing from the river, fearing lest he should be hemmed in on both sides ;
and in answer to Cyrus he said, " that he would take care that all should go well."14. During this time the Barbarian army advanced with a uniform pace;
and the Grecian line, still remaining in the same place, was gradually forming from those who came up from time to time.
Cyrus, riding by at a moderate distance from his army, 1 surveyed from thence both the lines, looking as well towards the enemy as to his own men.
15. Xenophon, an Athenian, perceiving him from the Grecian line, rode up to meet him, and inquired whether he had any commands ;
when Cyrus stopped his horse, and told him, and desired him to tell everybody, that the sacrifices and the appearances of the victims were favourable.
2 16. As he was saying this, he heard a murmur passing through the ranks, and asked what noise that was.
He answered,1 " that it was the watchword, passing now for the second time."
2 At which Cyrus won­ dered who had given it, and asked what the word was.
He replied that it was, " JUPITER THE PRESERVER and VICTORY."
17. When Cyrus heard it, " I accept it as a good omen," said he, " and let it be so."
Saying this, he rode away to his own station ;
and the two armies were now not more than three or four stadia distant from each other, when the Greeks sang the pæan, and began to march forward to meet the enemy.
18. And as, while they proceeded, some part of their body fluctu­ ated out of line,3 those who were thus left behind began to run :
and at the same time, they all raised just such a shout as they usually raise to Mars, and the whole of them took to a run­ ning pace.
Some say, that they made a noise with their spears against their shields, to strike terror into the horses.
19. But the Barbarians, before an arrow could reach them, gave way, and took to flight.
The Greeks then pursued them with all their force, calling out to each other, not to run, but to follow in order.
20. The chariots, abandoned by their drivers, were hurried, some through the midst of the enemies themselves, and others through the midst of the Greeks.
The Greeks, when they saw them coming, opened their ranks to let them pass;
some few, however, were startled and caught by them, as might happen in a race-course ;
but these, they said, suffered no material injury;
nor did any other of the Greeks receive any hurt in this battle, except that, on the left of their army, a man was said to have been shot with an arrow.
21. Cyrus, though he saw the Greeks victorious, and pur­ suing those of the enemies who were opposed to them, and though he felt great pleasure at the sight, and was already saluted as king by those about him, was not, however, led away to join in the pursuit;
but keeping the band of six hun­ dred cavalry, that were with him, drawn up in close order around hini, he attentively watched how the king would proceed ;
for lie well knew that he occupied the centre of the Persian army.
22. All the commanders of the Barbarians, indeed, lead1 their troops to battle occupying the centre of their own men ;
thinking that they will thus be most secure, if they have the strength of their force on either side of them, and that if they have occasion to issue orders, their army will receive them in half the time.
23. On the present occasion, the king, though he occupied the centre of his own army, was nevertheless be­ yond Cyrus's left wing.
But as no enemy attacked him in front, or the troops that were drawn up before him, he began to wheel round, as if to enclose his adversaries.
24. Cyrus, in consequence, fearing that he might take the Greeks in the rear, and cut them in pieces, moved directly upon him, and charging with his six hundred horse, routed the troops that were stationed in front of the king, and put the guard of six thousand to flight, and is said to have killed with his own hand Artagerses, their commander.
25.
When this flight of the enemy took place, Cyrus's six hundred became dispersed in the eagerness of pursuit;
only a very few remaining with him, chiefly those who were called "partakers of his table."26. While accompanied by these, he perceived the king and the close guard around him;
when he immediately lost his self-command, and exclaiming, "I see the man," rushed upon him, struck him on the breast, and wounded him through the breastplate, as Ctesias, the physician, relates, stating that he himself dressed the wound.
27. As Cyrus was in the act of striking, some one hit him violently with a javelin under the eye ;
and how many of those about the king were killed, (while they thus fought, the king, and Cyrus, and their re­ spective followers in defence of each,) Ctesias relates ;
for he was with him;
on the other side, Cyrus himself was killed, and eight of his principal officers lay dead upon his body.
28. Artapates, the most faithful servant to him of all his sceptre- bearers, 1 when he saw Cyrus fall, is said to have leaped from his horse, and thrown himself upon the body of his master;
29.
and some say, that the king ordered some one to kill him on the body of Cyrus;
but others relate, that lie drew his scimitar, and killed himself upon the body;
for he had a golden scimitar by his side, and also wore a chain and brace­ lets, and other ornaments, like the noblest of the Persians;
since he was honoured by Cyrus for his attachment and fidel ity to him.
The character of Cyrus.
All his personal friends are killed, except Adæus, who takes to flight.
1.
THUS then died Cyrus;
a man who, of all the Persians since Cyrus the elder, was the most princely and most worthy of empire, as is agreed by all who appeat to have had personal knowledge of him.
2. In the first place, while he was yet a boy, and when he was receiving his education with his brother and the other youths, he was thought to surpass them all in everything.
a.
For all the sons of the Persian nobles are educated at the gates of the king;
2 where they may learn many a lesson of virtuous conduct, but can see or hear nothing disgraceful.
4. Here the boys see some honoured by the king, and others disgraced, and hear of them ;
so that in their very childhood they learn to govern and to obey.
5.
Here Cyrus, first of all, showed himself most remark­ able for modesty among those of his own age, and for paying more ready obedience to his elders than even those who were inferior to him in station ;
and next, he was noted for his fondness for horses, and for managing them in a superior manner.
They found him, too, very desirous of learning, and most assiduous in practising, the warlike exercises of archery, and hurling the javelin.
6. When it suited his age, he grew extremely fond of the chase, and of braving dangers in encounters with wild beasts.
On one occasion, he did not shrink from a she-bear that attacked him, but, in grappling with her, was dragged from off his horse, and received some wounds, the scars of which were visible on his body, but at last killed her.
The person who first came to his assistance he made a happy man in the eyes of many.
7.
When he was sent down by his father, as satrap of Lydia and Great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and was also ap­ pointed commander of all the troops whose duty it is to muster in the plain of Castolus, he soon showed that if he made a league or compact with any one, or gave a promise, lie deemed it of the utmost importance not to break his word.
8. Accordingly the states that were committed to his charge, as well as individuals, had the greatest confidence in him;
and if any one had been his enemy, he felt secure that if Cyrus entered into a treaty with him, he should suffer no in­ fraction of the stipulations.
9. When, therefore, he waged war against Tissaphernes, all the cities, of their own accord, chose to adhere to Cyrus in preference to Tissaphernes, ex­ cept the Milesians;
but they feared him, because he would not abandon the cause of the exiles;
10.
for he both showed by his deeds, and declared in words, that he would never de­ sert them, since he had once become a friend to them, not even though they should grow still fewer in number, and be in a worse condition than they were.
11.
Whenever any one did him a kindness or an injury, lie showed himself anxious to go beyond him in those respects ;
and some used to mention a wish of his, that "he desired to live long enough to outdo both those who had done him good, and those who had done him ill, in the requital that he should make."
12. Accordingly to him alone of the men of our days were so great a number of people desirous of committing the disposal of their property, their cities, and their own persons.
13.
Yet no one could with truth say this of him, that he suffered the criminal or unjust to deride his authority;
for he of all men inflicted punishment most unsparingly;
and there were often to be seen, along the most frequented roads, men deprived of their feet, or hands, or eyes ;
so that in Cyrus's dominions, it was possible for any one, Greek or Bar­ barian, who did no wrong, to travel without fear whither­ soever he pleased, and having with him whatever might suit his convenience.
14.
To those who showed ability for war, it is acknow­ ledged that he paid distinguished honour.
His first war was with the Pisidians and Mysians ;
and, marching in person into these countries, lie made those, whom he saw voluntarily hazarding their lives in his service, governors over the terri­ tory that he subdued, and distinguished them with rewards in other ways.
15. So that the brave appeared to be the most fortunate of men, while the cowardly were deemed fit1 only to be their slaves.
There were, therefore, great numbers of persons who voluntarily exposed themselves to danger, wherever they thought that Cyrus would become aware of their exertions.
16.
With regard to justice, if any appeared to him inclined to display that virtue, he made a point of making such men richer than those who sought to profit by injustice.
17. Ac­ cordingly, while in many other respects his affairs were ad­ ministered judiciously, he likewise possessed an army worthy of the name.
For it was not for money that generals and captains came from foreign lands to enter into his service, but because they were persuaded that to serve Cyrus well, would be more profitable than any amount of monthly pay.
IS.
Besides, if any one executed his orders in a superior man­ ner, he never suffered his diligence to go unrewarded ;
con­ sequently, in every undertaking, the best qualified officers were said to be ready to assist him.
19.
If he noticed any one that was a skilful manager, with strict regard to justice, stocking the land of which he had the direction, and securing income from it, he would never taka anything from such a person, but was ever ready to give him something in addition ;
so that men laboured with cheerful­ ness, acquired property with confidence, and made no conceal­ ment from Cyrus of what each possessed;
for he did not appear to envy those who amassed riches openly, but to en­ deavour to bring into use the wealth of those who con­ cealcd it.
20.
Whatever friends he made, and felt to be well-disposed to him, and considered to be capable of assisting him in any­ thing that lie might wish to accomplish, he is acknowledged by all to have been most successful in attaching them to him.
21. For, on the very same account on which he thought that he himself had need of friends, namely, that lie might have co- operators in his undertakings, did he endeavour to prove an efficient assistant to his friends in whatever he perceived any of them desirous of effecting.
22.
He received, for many reasons, more presents than perhaps any other single individual;
and these he outdid every one else in distributing amongst his friends, having a view to the character of each, and to what he perceived each most needed.
23. Whatever presents any one sent him of articles of personal ornament, whether for warlike accoutre­ ment, or merely for dress, concerning these, they said, he used to remark, that he could not decorate his own person with them all, but that he thought friends well equipped were the greatest ornament a man could have.
24. That he should outdo his friends, indeed, in conferring great benefits, is not at all wonderful, since he was so much more able ;
but, that he should surpass his friends in kind attentions, and an anxious desire to oblige, appears to me far more worthy of admiration.
25. Frequently, when he had wine served him of a peculiarly fine flavour, he would send half-emptied flagons of it to some of his friends, with a message to this effect:
"Cyrus has not for some time met with pleasanter wine than this;
and he has therefore sent some of it to you, and begs you will drink it to-day, with those whom you love best."
26. He would often, too, send geese partly eaten, and the halves of loaves, and other such things, desiring the bearer to say, in present­ ing them, " Cyrus has been delighted with these, and there­ fore wishes you also to taste of them."27.
Wherever provender was scarce, but he himself, from having many attendants, and from the care which he took, was able to procure some, he would send it about, and de­ sire his friends to give that provender to the horses that carried them, so that hungry steeds might not carry his friends.
28. Whenever he rode out, and many were likely to see him, he would call to him his friends, and hold earnest conversation with them, that he might show whom he held in honour ;
so that, from what I have heard, I should think that no one was ever beloved by a greater number of persons, either Greeks or Barbarians.
29. Of this fact the following is a proof;
that no one deserted to the king from Cyrus, though only a subject, (except that Orontes attempted to do so ;
but he soon found the person whom he believed faithful to him, more a friend to Cyrus than to himself,) while many came over to Cyrus from the king, after they became enemies to each other;
and these, too, men who were greatly beloved by the king;
for they felt persuaded, that if they proved themselves brave soldiers under Cyrus, they would obtain from him more adequate rewards for their services than from the king.
30.
What occurred also at the time of his death, is a great proof, as well that lie himself was a man of merit, as that he could accurately distinguish such as were trust-worthy, well disposed, and constant in their attachment.
31. For when he was killed, all his friends, and the partakers of his table, who were with him, fell fighting in his defence, except Ariæus, who had been posted, in command of the cavalry, on the left;
and, when lie learned that Cyrus had fallen in the battle, he took to flight, with all the troops which he had under his command.
The head and right-hand of Cyrus cut off.
Artaxerxes pursues Ariseur.
plunders the camp of Cyrus, and then returns to attack the victorious Greeks, who put hiin to flight, recover what he had seized, and return to their camp.
1.
THE head and right-hand of Cyrus were then cut off.
The king, and the troops that were with him, engaging in pursuit, fell upon the camp of Cyrus ;
when the soldiers of Ariæus no longer stood their ground, but fled through their camp to the station whence they bad last started;
which was said to be four parasangs distant.
2. The king and his fol­ lowers seized upon many other things, and also captured the Phocæan woman, the mistress of Cyrus, who was said to be both accomplished and beautiful.
3. His younger mistress, a native of Miletus, being taken by some of the king's soldiers, fled for refuge, without her outer garment, to the party of Greeks,1 who were stationed under arms to guard the baggage, and who, drawing themselves up for defence, killed several of the pillagers;
and some of their own number also fell;
yet they did not flee, but saved not only the woman, but all the rest of the property and people that were in their quarters.
4.
The king and the main body of Greeks were now distant from each other about thirty stadia, the Greeks pur­ suing those that had been opposed to them, as if they had conquered all;
the Persians engaged in plundering, as if they were wholly victorious.
5. But when the Greeks found that the king with his troops was amongst their baggage;
and the king, on the other hand, heard from Tissaphernes, that the Greeks had routed that part of his line which had been op­ posed to them, and were gone forward in pursuit, the king, on his part, collected his forces, and formed them in line again ;
while Clearchus, on the other side, calling to him Proxenus, who happened to be nearest to him, consulted with him whether they should send a detachment to the camp, or proceed, all of them together, to relieve it.
6. In the mean time, the king was observed again approaching them, as it seemed, in their rear.
The Greeks, wheeling round, prepared to receive him, in the belief that he would attack them on that quarter;
the king, however, did not lead his troops that way, but led them off by the same route by which he had be­ fore passed on the outside of their left wing ;
taking with him both those who had deserted to the Greeks during the en­ gagement, and Tissaphernes with the troops under his com­ mand.
7.
Tissaphernes had not fled at the commencement of the engagement, but had charged through the Greek peltasts, close to the banks of the river.
In breaking through, how­ ever, he killed not a single man, for the Greeks, opening their ranks, struck his men with their swords, and hurled their javelins at them.
Episthenes of Amphipolis had the com­ mand of the peltasts, and was said to have proved himself an able captain.
8. Tissaphernes, therefore, when he thus came off with disadvantage, did not turn back again, but, proceed­ ing onwards to the Grecian camp, met the king there;
and thence they now returned together, with their forces united in battle-array.
9. When they were opposite the left wing of the Greeks, the Greeks feared lest they should attack them on that wing, and, enclosing them on both sides, should cut them off;
they therefore thought it advisable to draw back this wing, 1 and to put the river in their rear.
10. While they were planning this manoeuvre, the king, having passed be­ yond them, presented his force opposite to them, in the same form in which he had at first come to battle;
and when the Greeks saw their enemies close at hand, and drawn up for fight, they again sang the pæan, and advanced upon them with much greater spirit than before.
11. The Barbarians, on the other hand, did not await their onset, but fled sooner1 than at first;
and the Greeks pursued them as far as a certain village,2 where they halted;
12.
for above the village was a hill, upon which the king's troops had checked their flight, and though there were no longer any infantry3 there, the height was filled with cavalry;
so that the Greeks could not tell what was doing.
They said, that they saw the royal standard, a golden eagle upon a spear,4 with expanded wings.
513.
But as the Greeks were on the point of proceeding thither, the cavalry too left the hill;
not indeed in a body, but some in one direction and some in another;
and thus the hill was gradually thinned of cavalry, till at last they were all gone.
14. Clearchus, however, did not march up the hill, but, stationing his force at its foot, sent Lycius the Syracnsan and another up the hill, and ordered them, after taking a view from the summit, to report to him what was passing on the other side.
15.Lycius accordingly rode thither, and having made his observations, brought word that the enemy were fleeing with precipitation.
Just as these things took place, the sun set.
16. Here the Greeks halted, and piling their arms, took some rest;
and at the same time they wondered that Cyrus himself nowhere made his appearance, and that no one else came to them from him ;
for they did not know that he was killed, but conjectured that he was either gone in pursuit of the enemy, or had pushed forward to secure some post.
17. They then deliberated whether they should remain in that spot and fetch their baggage thither, or return to the camp ;
and it was resolved to return, and they arrived at the tents about supper-time.
18. Such was the conclusion of this day.
They found almost all their baggage, and whatever food and drink was with it, plundered and wasted ;
the waggons, too, full of barley-meal and wine, which Cyrus had provided, in order that, if ever a great scarcity of provisions should fall upon the army, he might distribute them amongst the Grecian troops, (and the waggons, as was said, were four hundred in number,) these also the king's soldiers had plundered.
19. Most of the Greeks consequently remained supperless;
and they had also been without dinner;
for before the army had halted for dinner, the king made his appearance.
In this state they passed the ensuing night.
The Greeks are surprised to hear of the death of Cyrus.
Ariæus resolves to return to Ionia, contrary to the advice of Clearchus, who incites him to make an attempt on the throne of Persia.
Artaxerxes sends a message to the Greeks ;
their reply.
I.
How the Grecian force was collected for Cyrus, when he undertook his expedition against his brother Artaxerxes, what occurred in his march up the country, how the battle took place, how Cyrus was killed, and how the Greeks re­ turned to their camp and went to rest, in the belief that they were completely victorious, and that Cyrus was still alive, has been related in the preceding book.
2.
When it was day, the generals met together, and ex­ pressed their surprise that Cyrus had neither sent any person to give directions how they should act, nor had made his ap­ pearance himself.
It seemed best to them, therefore, to pack up what baggage they had, and, arming themselves, to march forward till they could effect a junction with Cyrus.
3. But when they were on the point of starting, just as the sun was rising, there came to them Procles,the governor of Teuthrania, (who was descended from Damaratus, the Lacedæmonian,) and with him Glus, the son of Tamos, who told them that Cyrus was dead, and that Ariæus, having fled, was, with the rest of the Barbarians, at the station whence they started the day before;
and that he said he would wait for the Greeks that day, if they would come to him ;
but on the morrow, he said, he should set off for Ionia, from whence he had come.
4.
The generals, on hearing this intelligence, and the other Greeks, on learning it from them,' were grievously afflicted;
and Clearchus spoke thus:
“ Would that Cyrus were still alive;
but since he is no more, carry back word to Ariæus, that we at least are victorious over the king, and that, as you see, no enemy any longer offers us battle;
and, if you had not come, we should have marched against the king;
and we pro­ mise Ariæns, that, if lie will come hither, we will seat him on the royal throne;
for to those who conquer, it belongs also to rule.”5. Saying this, he dismissed the messengers, and bent with them Cheirisophus the Lacedæmonian, and Menon the Thessalian ;
for Menon himself desired to go, as he was con­ nected with Ariæus by ties of friendship and hospitality.
6.
While they departed on their mission Clearchus walted where he was;
and the troops supplied themselves with food, as well as they could, from the carcases of their baggage-cattle slaughtering their oxen and asses;
and, going a little way in front of the line, to the place where the battle was fouglir, they collected and used as fuel, not only the arrows, which lay in great quantities, and which the Greeks had compelled the deserters from the king to throw down, but also the wicker shields of the Persians, and the wooden ones of the Egyptians ;
and there were also many other light shields, and waggons emptied of their contents,1 to be taken away;
using all which materials to cook the meat, they appeased their hunger for that day.
7.
It was now about the middle of the forenoon,2 when some heralds arrived from the king and Tissaphernes, all of them Barbarians, except one, a Greek named Phalinus, who chanced to be with Tissaphernes, and was highly esteemed by him, for he had pretensions to skill in the arrangement of troops, and in the exercise of heavy arms.
8. These persons having approached, and asked to speak with the commanders of the Greeks, told them, “that the king, since lie had gained the victory and slain Cyrus, required the Greeks to deliver up their arms, and go to the gates of the king,3 and try to obtain, if they could, some favour from him."
9. Thus spoke the king's heralds;
and the Greeks heard them with no small concern ;
but Clearchus only said, “that it was not the part of conquerors to deliver up their arms:
but," he continued, “do you, fellow-captains, give these men such an answer as you think most honourable and proper;
and I will return im­ mediately ;
" for one of the attendants just then called him away to inspect the entrails which had been taken out of the victim, as he happened to be engaged in sacrifice.
10. Cleaner the Arcadian, the oldest of them, then answered, that " they would die before they would deliver up their arms." “ For my part," said Proxenus the Theban, “ I wonder, Phalinus, whether it is as conqueror that the king asks for our arms, or as gifts in friendship ;
for if as conqueror, why should he ask for them at all, and not rather come and take them ?
But if lie wishes to get them from us by means of persuasion, let him say what will be left to the soldiers, if they gratify him in this particular.”11. To this Phalinus replied, " The king considers himself the conqueror, since he has slain Cyrus.
For who is there now that disputes the sovereignty with him ?
And he also looks upon yourselves as his captives, having you here in the middle of his dominions, and enclosed within im­ passable rivers;
and being able to lead such multitudes against you, as, though he gave them into your power, it would be impossible for you to destroy."12. After him, Theopompus,' an Athenian, spoke thus:
“ 0 Phalinus, we have now, as you see, nothing to avail us, ex­ cept our arms and our valour.
While we retain our arms, we may hope to profit by our valour;
but if we were to give them up, we should expect to be deprived also of our lives.
Do not suppose, therefore, that we shall give up to you the only things of value that we possess;
but, with these in our hands.
we will even fight for whatever of value you possess."
13. On hearing him speak thus, Phalinus smiled, and said, "You seem like a philosopher, young man, and express yourself not without grace;
but be assured that you are out of your senses if you imagine that your valour will prove victorious over the might of the king."
14. But it was reported that certain others of the generals, giving way to their fears, said that they had been faithful to Cyrus, and might likewise prove of great service to the king, if he were willing to become their friend;
and that whether he might wish to employ them in any other service, or in an expedition against Egypt, they would assist him in reducing it."15.
In the mean time Clearchus returned, and asked whether they had yet given their answer.
Phalinus, in reply, said, “ Your companions, 0 Clearchus, give each a different an­ swer;
and now tell us what you have to say."
16. Clearchus then said, “ I was glad to see you, 0 Phalinus, and so, I dare say, were all the rest of us ;
for you are a Greek, as we also are ;
and, being so many in number as you see, and placed in such circumstances we would advise with you how we should act with regard to the message that you bring.
17 Give us then, I entreat you by the gods, such advice as seems to you most honourable and advantageous, and such as will bring you honour in time to come, when it is related, that Phalinus, being once sent from the king to require the Greeks to deliver up their arms, gave them, when they consulted him, such and such counsel;
for you know that whatever counsel you do give, will necessarily be reported in Greece."is.
Clearchus craftily threw out this suggestion,' with the desire that the very person who came as an envoy from the king, should advise them not to deliver up their arms, in order that the Greeks might be led to conceive better hopes.
But Phalinus, adroitly evading the appeal, spoke, contrary to his expectation, as follows:
19.
"If, out of ten thousand hopeful chances, you have any single one, of saving yourselves by con- tinuing in arms against the king, I advise you not to deliver up your arms;
but if you have not a single hope of safety in opposing the king's pleasure, I advise you to save yourselves in the only way in which it is possible."
20. Clearchus re­ joined, "Such, then, is your advice ;
but on our part return this answer, that we are of opinion, that, if we are to be friends with the king, we shall be more valuable friends if we retain our arms, than if we surrender them to another ;
but that if we must make war against him, we should make war better if we retain our arms, than if we give them up to another."
21. Phalinus said, " This answer, then, we will report:
but the king desired us also to inform you, that while you remain in this place, a truce is to be considered as existing between him and you;
but, if you advance or retreat, there is to be war.
Give us, therefore, your answer on this point also ;
whether you will remain here, and a truce is to exist, or whether I shall announce from you, that there is war."
22. Clearchus re­ plied, “Report, therefore, on this point also, that our resolution is the same as that of the king." “
And what is that ? " said Phalinus.
Clearchus replied, “ If we stay here, a truce;
but if we retreat or advance, war." 23. Phalinus again asked him, " Is it a truce or war that I shall report ? "
Clearchus again made the same answer:
"A truce, if we stay ;
and if we re­ treat or advance, war."
But of what he intended to do, he gave no intimation.
The Greeks, joining Ariæus, form an alliance with him, and take counsel with him in reference to their return.
During the night following the first day's march they are seized with a panic, which Clearchus allays.
1.
PHALINUS and his companions departed ;
and there now returned, from their interview with Ariæus, Procles and Cheirisophus;
Menon had remained there with Ariæus.
They reported, “ that Ariæus said that there were many Per­ sians, of superior rank to himself, who would not endure that he should be king;
but," he adds, " If you wish to return with him, he desires you to come to him this very night;
if you do not, he says that he will set out by himself early in the morning."
2. Clearchus rejoined. “
And we must certainly do as you say, if we determine to go to him ;
but if not, adopt for yourselves such measures as you may think most for your advantage :
”for not even to them did he disclose what he in­ tended to do.
3.
But afterwards, when the sun was setting, having as­ sembled the generals and captains, he spoke as follows:
“My friends, when I offered a sacrifice with reference to marching gainst the king, the signs of the victims were not favourable, and indeed it was with good cause that they were not so;
for as I now learn, there is between us and the king the river Tigris, a navigable river, which we could not cross without vessels;
and vessels we have none.
Yet it is not possible to remain here;
for we have no means of procuring provisions.
But for going to the friends of Cyrus, the sacrifices were ex­ tremely favourable.
4. We must accordingly proceed thus:
when we separate, we must sup, each of us on what he has ;
when the signal is given with the horn as if for going to rest, proceed to pack up your baggage;
when it sounds the second time, place it on your baggage-cattle ;
and, at the third signal, follow him who leads the way, keeping your baggage-cattle next the river, and the heavy-armed troops on the outside."5.
The generals and captains, after listening to this address, went away, and did as lie directed ;
and thenceforth he com­ manded, and the others obeyed, not indeed having elected him commander, but perceiving that he alone possessed such qua­ locations as a leader ought to have, and that the rest of them were comparatively inexperienced.
6.
The computation of the route which they had come from .
Ephesus in Ionia to the field of battle, was ninety-three days' march, and five hundred and thirty-five parasangs, or sixteen thousand and fifty stadia ;
1 and the distance from the field of battle to Babylon was said to be three hundred and sixty stadia.
7.
Here, as soon as it was dark, Miltocythes the Thracian deserted to the king, with about forty horse that he com- manded, and nearly three hundred of the Thracian infantry.
8. Clearchus led the way for the rest, in the prescribed order ;
and they followed, and arrived at the first halting- place,' to join Ariæus and his troops about midnight;
and the generals and captains of the Greeks, having drawn up their men under arms, went in a body to Ariæus ;
when the Greeks on the one hand, and Ariæus and his principal officers on the other, took an oath not to betray each other, and to be true allies ;
and the Barbarians took another oath, that they would lead the way without treachery.
9. These oaths they took after sacrificing a bull, a wolf,2 a boar, and a ram, over a shield, the Greeks dipping a sword, and the Barbarians a lance, into the blood.10.
When these pledges of mutual fidelity were given, Clearchus said :
“Since then, Ariæus, our route and yours is now the same, tell us,'what is your opinion with respect to our course;
whether we shall return the way we came, or whether you consider that you have thought of a better way."
11. Ariæus replied:
" If we were to return the way we came, we should all perish of hunger:
for we have now no supply of provisions ;
and for the last seventeen days' march, even when we were coming hither, we could procure nothing from the country through which we passed ;
or, if anything was to be found there, we consumed it ourselves in our passage.
But now we propose to take a longer road, but one in which we shall not want for provisions.
12. We must make the first days' marches as long as we can, that we may remove our­ selves to the greatest possible distance from the king's army ;
for if we once escape two or three days' journey from him, the king will no longer be able to overtake us;
since he will not dare to pursue us with a small force ;
and, with a numerous army, he will not be able to march fast enough, and will pro bably experience a scarcity of provisions.
“ Such,” lie con­ eluded, “ is my opinion."13.
This scheme for conducting the army was calculated for nothing else than to effect an escape, clandestinely or openly, by flight.
1
But fortune proved a better leader;
for as soon as it was day they began their march, with the sun on their right, expecting to arrive about sunset at some villages in the Babylonian territory ;
and in this expectation they were not disappointed.
14. But, in the afternoon, they thought that they perceived some of the enemy's cavalry;
and those of the Greeks who happened not to be in their ranks, ran to their places in the ranks ;
and Ariæus (for he was riding in a wag­ gon because he had been wounded) came down and put on his armour, as did those who were with him.
15. But while they were arming themselves, the scouts that had been sent forward returned, and reported that they were not cavalry, but baggage-cattle grazing ;
and every one immediately con­ eluded that the king was encamped somewhere near.
Smoke also was seen rising from some villages not far distant.
16. Clearchus however did not lead his troops against the enemy ;
(for he was aware that his soldiers were tired and in want of food ;
and besides it was now late;
) yet he did not turn out of his way, taking care not to appear to flee, but continued his march in a direct line, and took up his quarters with his vanguard, just at sunset, in the nearest villages, from which even the wood-work of the houses had been carried off by the king's troops.
17. These, therefore, who were in advance, encamped with some degree of regularity;
but those who followed, coming up in the dark, took up with such quarters as they chanced to find, and made so much noise in calling to each other, that even the enemy heard them;
and those of the enemy who were stationed the nearest, fled from their encampments.
is.
That this had been the case, became ap­ parent on the following day;
for there was no longer a single beast of burden to be seen, nor any camp, nor smoke any­ where near.
The king had been alarmed, as it seemed, by the sudden approach of the Grecian army ;
and of this he gave proof by what he did on the following day.
19.
However, in the course of this night, a panic fell upon the Greeks themselves, and there arose such noise and com­ motion in their camp as usually ensues oil the occurrence of sudden terror.
20. Upon this, Clearchus ordered Tolmides, an Eleian, whom he happened to have with him, the best 1 herald of his time, to command silence;
and proclaim, that "the generals give notice, that whoever will give information of the person who turned the ass among the arms,2 shall re­ ceive a reward of a talent of silver."
21. On this proclama­ tion being made, the soldiers were convinced that their alarm was groundless, and their generals were safe.
At break of day, Clearchus issued orders for the Greeks to form themselves under arms, in the same order in which they had been when the battle took place.
The king proposes a truce, and supplies the Greeks with provisions during the negotiation.
Three days after he sends Tissaphernes to them, to ask why they had engaged in hostilities against him;
he is answered by Clearchus.
A treaty is then concluded, the king engaging to send home the Greeks under the conduct of Tissaphernes, and the Greeks promising to do no injury to the countries through which they should pass.
1.
WHAT I just now stated, that the king was alarmed at me approach of the Greeks, became evident by what followed;
for though, when he sent to them on the preceding day, he desired them to deliver up their arms, he now, at sunrise, sent heralds to negotiate a truce.
2. These heralds, upon arriving at the outposts, requested to speak with the commanders.
Their request being reported by the guards, Clearchus, who happened then to be inspecting the several divisions, told the guards to desire the heralds to wait till he should be at leisure.
3. When he had arranged the army in such a manner as to present on every side the fair appearance of a compact pha­ lanx, and so that none of the unarmed were to be seen, lie called for the heralds, and came forward himself, having about him the best-armed and best-looking of his soldiers, and told the other leaders to do the same.
4. When he drew near the messengers, he asked them what they wanted.
They replied, " that they came to negotiate a truce, with full powers to com­ municate with the Greeks on behalf of the king, and with the king on behalf of the Greeks."
5. Clearchus answered, " Tell the king, then, that we must come to battle first;
for we have no breakfast and there is no one who will dare to talk to the Greeks of a truce, without first supplying them with breakfast.
"6.
On hearing this answer, the messengers departed, but soon returned;
from whence it was apparent that the king, or some other person to whom a commission had been given to conduct the negotiation, was somewhere near.
They brought word, " that the king thought what they said was reasonable, and that they now came with guides, who, in case the truce should be settled, would conduct the Greeks to a place where they might procure provisions."
7. Clearchus then inquired, whether the king would grant the benefit of the truce to those only who went to him, on their way thither and back, or whether the truce would be with the rest as well.
2
The mes­ sengers replied, “With all;
until what you have to say is communicated to the king."
8. When they had said this, Clearchus, directing them to withdraw, deliberated with the ther officers ;
and they proposed to conclude the truce at once, and to go after the provisions at their ease, and supply themselves..
9. And Clearchus said, “ I too am of that opinion.
I will not, however, announce our determination immediately, but will wait till the messengers begin to be un­ easy lest we should determine not to conclude the truce.
And yet," said he, " I suspect that a similar apprehension will arise among our own soldiers.”
When he thought therefore that the proper time had arrived, he announced to the messengers that he agreed to the truce, and desired them to conduct him forthwith to the place where the provisions were.
10.
They accordingly led the way ;
and Clearchus proceeded to conclude the truce, keeping his army however in battle- array;
the rear he brought up himself.
They met with ditches and canals so full of water that they could not cross without bridges ;
but they made crossings of the palm-trees which had fallen, and others which they cut down.
11. Here it might be seen how Clearchus performed the duties of a commander, holding his spear in his left hand, and a staff in his right;
and if any of those ordered to the work seemed to him to loiter at it, he would select a fit object for punishment, 1 and give him a beating, and would lend his assistance him­ self,2 leaping into the midst, so that all were ashamed not to share his industry.
12. The men of thirty and under only had been appointed by him to the work;
but the older men, when they saw Clearchus thus busily employed, gave their assistance likewise.
13. Clearchus made so much the more haste, as he suspected that the ditches were not always so full of water;
(for it was not the season for irrigat­ ing the ground ;
) but thought that the king had let out the water upon the plain, in order that even now there might ap pear to the Greeks to be many difficulties in the march.
14.
Proceeding on their way, they arrived at some villages, from which the guides signified that they might procure pro­ visions.
In these villages there was great plenty of corn, and wine made from dates, and an acidulous drink obtained from them by boiling.
15. As to the dates themselves, such as those we see in Greece were here put aside for the use of the serv­ ants ;
but those which were laid by for their masters, were choice fruit, remarkable for beauty and size;
their colour was not unlike that of amber;
and some of these they dried and preserved as sweetmeats.
These were a pleasant accompani­ ment to drink, but apt to cause headache.
16. Here too the sol­ diers for the first time tasted the cabbage1 from the top of the palm-tree, and most of them were agreeably struck both with its external appearance and the peculiarity of its sweetness.
But this also was exceedingly apt to give headache.
The palm-tree, out of which the cabbage had been taken, soon withered throughout.
17.
In this place they remained three days, when Tissa­ phernes arrived from the Great King, and with him the brother of the king's wife, and three other Persians ;
and a numerous retinue attended them.
The generals of the Greeks having met them on their arrival, Tissaphernes first spoke by an interpreter, to the following effect:
18.
"I myself dwell, 0 Greeks, in the neighbourhood of your country;
and when I perceived you fallen into many troubles and difficulties, I thought it a piece of good fortune if I could in any way press a request upon the king to allow me to conduct you in safety back to Greece.
For I think that such a service would be attended with no want of gratitude either from yourselves or from Greece in general.
19. With these considerations, I made my request to the king, representing to him that he might reasonably grant me this favour, because I had been the first to give him intelligence that Cyrus was marching against him, and at the same time that I brought him the intelligence, had come to him with an auxiliary force;
because I alone, of all those opposed to the Greeks, did not flee, but, on the contrary, charged through the midst of them, and joined the king in your camp, whither he came after he had slain Cyrus ;
and because, together with these who are now present with me, and who are his most faithful servants, I engaged in pur­ suit of the Barbarian part of Cyrus's army.
20. The king promised to consider of my request;
and in the mean time de­ sired me to come and ask you, on what account it was that you took the field against him ;
and I advise you to answer with moderation, in order that it may be easier for me to se cure you whatever advantage I can from the king."21. The Greeks then withdrew, and, after some deliberation, gave their answer, Clearchus speaking for them :
"
We neither formed ourselves into a body, with the view of making war upon the king, nor, when we set out, was our march directed against him;
but Cyrus, as you yourself are well aware, de­ vised many pretences for his proceedings, that he might both take you by surprise, and lead us up hither.
22. But when we afterwards saw him in danger, we were ashamed, in the face of gods and men, to desert him, as we had before allowed him tc bestow favours upon us.
23. As Cyrus, however, is now dead, we neither dispute the sovereignty with the king, nor is there any reason why we should desire to do harm to the king's territory ;
nor would we wish to kill him, but would proceed homeward, if no one molest us ;
but we will endeavour with the aid of the gods, to avenge ourselves on any one that may do us an injury ;
while, if any one does us good, we shall not be behind-hand in requiting him to the utmost of our power."
Thus spoke Clearchus.
24. Tissaphernes, hav­ ing heard him, said, “ I will report your answer to the king, and bring back to you his reply ;
and till I return, let the truce remain in force;
and we will provide a market for you."25.
On the following day he did not return ;
so that the Greeks began to be anxious;
but on the third day he came, and said, that he returned after having obtained the king'a permission to be allowed to save the Greeks;
although many spoke against it, saying that it did not become the king to suffer men to escape who bad engaged in war against him.
26. In conclusion he said, " You may now receive from us solemn promises that we will render the country, through which you will pass, friendly to you ;
and will, without treach­ ery, conduct you back to Greece, affording you opportunities of purchasing provisions;
and wheresoever we do not afford you an opportunity of purchasing, we will allow you to take for yourselves necessaries from the adjacent country.
27. On the other hand, it will be incumbent upon you to swear to us, that you will march, as through a friendly territory, without doing harm, only taking a supply of meat and drink, whenever we do not give you an opportunity of purchasing, but that if we give you such opportunity, you will procure your supplies by purchase."
28. These conditions were assented to;
and they took the oaths, and Tissaphernes and the brother of the king's wife gave their right-hands to the generals and captains of the Greeks, and received from the Greeks theirs in return.
29. After this, Tissaphernes said, " And now I shall go back to the king ;
and as soon as I have accomplished what I wish, I will come again, after making the necessary preparations, for the purpose of conducting you back to Greece, and returning myself to my province.
"
The Greeks conceive distrust both of Tissaphernes and Ariæus, and resolve to march apart from the Persians, They commence their march uuder the guidance of Tissaphernes, pass the wall of Media, and cross the Tigris.1.
AFTER these occurrences, the Greeks and Ariæus, en­ camping near each other, waited for Tissaphernes more than twenty days;
1 in the course of which there came to visit Ariæus both his brothers and other relations, and certain other Persians, to see his companions, and gave them encouraging hopes;
some too were the bearers of assurances 2 from tl -a king, that he would not remember to their disadvantage their expedition against him under Cyrus, or anything else that was past.
2. On these things taking place, the followers of Ariæus evidently began to pay the Greeks less attention ;
so that, on this account, they rendered most of the Greeks dissa­ tisfied with them;
and many of them, going to Clearchus and the other generals, said, 3. " Why do we remain here ?
are we not aware that the king would wish above all things to destroy us, in order that a dread of going to war with the Great Monarch may fall upon the rest of the Greeks?
For the present, he craftily protracts our stay, be­ cause his forces are dispersed;
but, when his army is re-as­ sembled, it is not possible but that he will attack us.
4 Perhaps, too, he is digging some trench, or building some wall, that the way may be rendered impassable ;
for he will never consent, at least willingly, that we should go back to Greece, and relate how so small a number as we are have defeated the king at his own gates, and returned after setting him at nought.
"5. To those who thus addressed him, Clearehus answered, " I have been considering all these things as well;
but I think that, if we now go away, we shall be thought to go with a view to war, and to act contrary to the terms of the truce.
Moreover, in the first place, there will be no one to provide us a market, or any means of procuring provisions;
and, in the next place, there will be no one to guide us ;
besides, the mo­ ment that we do this, Ariæus will separate himself from us ;
so that not a friend will be left us ;
and, what is more, our former friends will then become our enemies.
6. Whether there is any other river for us to cross, I do not know ;
but as for the Euphrates, we know that it is impossible to cross that, if the enemy try to prevent us.
Nor yet, if it should be necessary to fight, have we any horse to support us;
while the enemy's cavalry is most numerous and efficient ;
so that, though we were victorious, how many of our enemies should we be able to kill ?
And, if we were defeated, it would not be possible for a man of us to escape.
7. With regard to the king, therefore, who is aided by so many advantages, I know not, if he wishes to effect our destruction, why he should swear, and give his right-hand, and perjure himself before the gods, and render his pledges faithless both to Greeks and Barbarians."
He said much besides to the same effect.
8. In the mean time Tissaphernes arrived, with his army, as if with the view of returning home;
and Orontes came with his army.
Orontes also brought1 with him the lung'a daughter, whom he had received in marriage.
2 9. From hence they now proceeded on their march, Tissaphernes being their gnide, and securing them opportunities of buying pro­ visions ;
Ariæus also, with the Barbarian troops of Cyrus, marched in company with Tissaphernes and Orontes, and en­ camped in common with them.
10. But the Greeks, conceiv­ ing a suspicion of these men, began to march by themselves, taking guides of their own ;
and they always encamped at the distance of a parasang, or little less, from each other ;
and both parties kept on their guard against one another, as if they had been enemies, and this consequently increased their mistrustful feelings.
11. More than once, too, as they were gathering fuel, or collecting grass and other snch things, in the same quarter, they came to blows with each other;
3 and this was an additional source of animosity between them.
12. After marching three days, they arrived at the wall of Media,4 as it is called, and passed to the other side of it.
This wall was built of burnt bricks, laid in bitumen ;
it was twenty feet in thickness, and a hundred in height, and the length of it was said to be twenty parasangs ;
and it was not far distant from Babylon.
13. Hence they proceeded, in two days' march, the distance of eight parasangs;
crossing two canals, the one by a permanent bridge, the other by a temporary one formed ot seven boats.
These canals were supplied from the river Tigris ;
and from one to the other of them were cut ditches across the country, the first of considerable size, and the next smaller;
and at last diminutive drains, such as are cut in Greece through the panic1 fields.
They then arrived at the Tigris;
nea which there was a large and populous city, called Sitace, dis­ tant from the banks of the river only fifteen stadia.
14. In the neighbourhood of this city the Greeks encamped, close to an extensive and beautiful park, thickly planted with all kinds of trees.
The Barbarians, though they had but just crossed the Tigris, were no longer in sight.
15.
After supper Proxenus and Xenophon happened to be walking in front of the place where the arms were piled, when a man approached, and inquired of the sentinels where he could see Proxenus or Clearchus.
But he did not ask for Menon, though he came from Ariæus, Menon's intimate friend.
16. Proxenus replying, " I am the person whom you seek," the man said, “ Ariæus and Artaozus, the faithful friends of Cyrus, who are interested for your welfare, have sent me to you, and exhort you to beware lest the Barbarians should fall upon you in the night;
for there is a considerable body of troops in the adjoining park.
17. They also advise you to send a guard to the bridge over the Tigris, as Tissaphernes designs to break it down in the night, if he can, in order that you may not be able to cross the river, but may be hemmed in between the river and the canal." is.
On hearing the man's message, they conducted him to Clearchus, and told him what lie had said.
When Clearchus heard it he was greatly agitated and alarmed.
19.
But a young man,2 one of those who were present, after reflecting a little on the matter, observed, “ that the imputed designs of making an attack, and of breaking down the bridge, were not consistent;
for," said he, " if they attack us, they must certainly either conquer or be conquered ;
if then they are to conquer us, why should they break down the bridge ?
for even though there were many bridges, we have no place where we could save ourselves by flight;
20.
but if, on the other hand, we should conquer them, then, if the bridge is broken down, they will have no place of retreat ;
nor will any of their friends on the other side of the river, however numerous, be able to come to their assistance when the bridge is destroyed."
21. After listening to these observations, Clear­ chus asked the messenger what was the extent of the country that lay between the Tigris and the canal.
He replied, "that it was of considerable extent, and that there were several vil­ lages and large towns in it."
22. It was then immediately con­ cluded, that the Barbarians had sent this man with an under­ hand object, being afraid lest the Greeks, having taken to pieces1 the bridge, should remain in the island, where they would have, as defences, the river Tigris on the one side, and the canal on the other ;
and might procure a sufficient supply of provisions from the country which lay between, and which was extensive and fertile, with people in it to cultivate it;
and which would also serve as a place of refuge to any that might be inclined to annoy the king.
23.
They then prepared for rest, but did not neglect, how­ ever, to send a guard to the bridge;
but neither did any one attempt to attack them on any quarter, nor did any of the enemies come near the bridge, as those who were stationed on guard there reported.
24.
As soon as it was day they crossed the bridge, which was constructed of thirty-seven boats, with every precaution in their power;
for some of the Greeks, who came from Tis­ saphernes, stated that the enemy meant to attack them as they were crossing;
but this report was also false.
However, as they were going over, GIns made his appearance, with some others, watching to see if they were crossing the river;
and when they saw they were, he immediately rode away.
25.
From the Tigris they proceeded, in four days' march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Physcus, which was a plethrum in breadth, and over which was a bridge.
Hero was situate a large town, called Opis;
near which an ille­ gitimate brother of Cyrus and Artaxerxes, who was leading a numerous army from Susa and Ecbatana, with the intention of assisting the king, met the Greeks, and, ordering his troops to halt, took a view of the Greeks as they passed by.
16 Clearchus marched his men two abreast, and halted occasion ally on the way;
and as long as the van of the army halted, so long there was necessarily a halt throughout the whole of the line;
so that even to the Greeks themselves their army seemed very large, and the Persian was amazed at the sight of it.
17.
Hence they proceeded through Media,1 six days' march through a desert country, a distance of thirty parasangs, when they arrived at the villages of Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus and the king;
which Tissaphernes, in mockery of Cyrus, gave permission to the Greeks to plunder of everything except the slaves.
There was found in them a great quantity of corn, and sheep, and other property.
18. Hence they advanced in a march of five days more through the desert, a distance of twenty parasangs, having the Tigris on their left.
At the end of the first day's march there was situate on the opposite bank of the river a large and opulent city, called Cænæ, whence the Barbarians brought over, on rafts made of hide a supply of bread, cheese, and wine.
After a three days’ halt on the river Zabatus, Clearchus endeavours to pin an end to the distrust between the Persians and the Greeks by an inter­ view with Tissaphernes, He is received so plausibly that he is induced to return on the following day, accompanied by five other generals and twenty captains, in expectation of being informed of the persons who had excited, by false reports, ill feelings between the two armies.
The gener­ als are conducted into the tent and put to death;
the captains and those with them are massacred on the outside, one only escaping to tell the tale.
Ariæus calls on the rest of the Greeks to surrender their arms, but is an­ swered with defiance.
1. SOON after, they arrived at the river Zabatus, the breadth of which was four plethra.
Here they remained three days ;
during which the same suspicions continued, but no open in­ dication of treachery appeared.
2. Clearchus therefore re­ solved to have a meeting with Tissaphernes, and, if it was at all possible, to put a stop to these suspicions, before open hos­ tilities should arise from them.
He accordingly sent a person to say, that he wished to have a meeting with Tissaphernes;
who at once requested him to come.
3. When they met, Clearchus spoke as follows:
“ I am aware, 0 Tissaphernes, that oaths have been taken, and right-hands pledged between us, that we will do no injury to each other:
nevertheless, I observe you on your guard against us, as though we were enemies;
and we, perceiving this, stand on our guard against you.
4. But since, upon attentive observation, I can neither detect yon in any attempt to injure us, and since, as I am certain, we have no such intentions towards you, it seemed proper for me to come to a conference with you, that we may put an end, if we can, to our distrust of one another.
5. For I have, before now, known instances of men, who, being in fear of another, some through direct accusations, and others through mere suspicion, have, in their eagerness to act before they suffered, inflicted irremediable evils upon those who nei­ ther intended nor wished anything of the kind.
6. Think­ ing, therefore, that such misunderstandings may be best cleared up by personal communications, I have come here, and am desirous to convince you that you have no just ground for mistrusting us.
7. In the first and principal place, the oaths, which we have sworn by the gods, forbid us to be ene­ mies to each other;
and I should never consider him to be envied who is conscious of having disregarded such obliga­ tions;
for from the vengeance of the gods I know not with what speed any one could flee so as to escape, 1 or into what darkness he could steal away, or how he could retreat into any stronghold, since all things, in all places, are subject to the gods ;
and they have power over all everywhere alike.
8. Such are my sentiments respecting the gods, and the oaths which we swore by them, in whose keeping we deposited the friend­ ship that we cemented;
but among human advantages, I, for my own part, consider you to be the greatest that we at pre sent possess;
9. for with your assistance, every road is easy, every river is passable, and there will be no want of provi­ sions;
but without you all our way would lie through dark­ ness, (for we know nothing of it,) every river would be diffi­ cult to pass, and every multitude of men would be terrible :
but solitude most terrible of all, as it is full of extreme per­ plexity.
to.
And even if we should be so mad as to kill you, what else would be the consequence, than that, having slain our benefactor, we should have to contend with the king as your most powerful avenger ?
1
For my own part, of how many and how great expectations I should deprive myself, if I at­ tempted to do you any injury, I will make you acquainted.
11. I was desirous that Cyrus should be my friend, as I thought him, of all the men of his time, the most able to benefit those whom he wished to favour.
But I now see that you are in the possession both of the power and the territory of Cyrus, while you still retain your own province, and that the power of the king, which was opposed to Cyrus, is ready to support you.
12. Such being the case, who is so mad as not to wish to be your friend ?
"But I will mention also the circumstances from which I derive hopes that you will yourself desire to be our friend.
13. I am aware that the Mysians give you much annoyance, and these, I have no doubt, I should be able, with my present force, to render subservient to you;
I am aware also that the Pisidians molest you ;
and I hear that there are many such nations besides, which I think I could prevent from ever dis­ turbing your tranquillity.
As for the Egyptians, against whom I perceive you are most of all incensed, I do not see what auxiliary force you could use to chastise them better than that which I now have with me.
14. If, again, among the states that lie around you, you were desirous to become a friend to any one, you might prove the most powerful of friends;
and if any of them gave you any annoyance, you might, by our instrumentality, deal with them2 as a master, as we should serve you not for the sake of pay merely, but from gratitude, which we should justly feel towards you if we are saved by your means.
15. When I consider all these things, it appears to me so surprising that you should distrust us, that I would most gladly hear the name 1 of him who is so persua­ sive a speaker as to make you believe that we are forming designs against you.
"Thus spoke Clearchus.
Tissaphernes replied as follows:
16.
"I am delighted, 0 Clearchus, to hear your judicious ob­ servations ;
for, with these sentiments, if you were to meditate anything to my injury, you would appear to be at the same time your own enemy.
But that you may be convinced that you have no just cause for distrusting either the king or me, listen to me in your turn.
17. If we wisked to destroy you, do we appear to yon to be deficient in numbers either of cavalry or infantry, or in warlike equipments, with the aid of which we might be able to do you injury, without danger of suffering any in return?
IS.
Or do we seem to you likely to be in want of suitable places to make an attack upon you?
Are there not so many plains, which, as the inhabitants of them are friendly to us,2 you traverse with exceeding toil ?
See yon not so many mountains before you to be crossed, which we might, by pre-occupying them, render impassable to you ?
Or are there not so many rivers, at which we might parcel you out,3 as many at a time as we might be willing to engage?
Some of these rivers, indeed, you could not cross at all, unless we secured you a passage.
19. But even suppos­ ing that we were baffled in all these points, yet fire at least would prove its power over the produce of the soil ;
by burn­ ing which, we could set famine in array against you, which, though you were the bravest of the brave, you would find it difficult to withstand.
20. How then, having so many means of waging war with yon, and none of them attended with danger to ourselves, should we select from amongst them all this mode, the only one that is impious in the sight of the gods, the only one that is disgraceful in the sight of men?
31. It belongs, altogether, to men who are destitute of means, deprived of every resource, and under the coercion of neces­ sity, and at the same time devoid of principle, to seek to effect their purposes by perjury towards the gods, and breach of faith towards men.
We, 0 Clearchus, are not so foolish or so inconsiderate;
22.
or why, when we have the opportunity of effecting your destruction, have we made no such attempt?
Be well assured, that the cause of this was my desire to prove myself faithful to the Greeks, and, in consequence of doing them service, to return supported by that very body of foreign troops, to whom Cyrus, when lie went up, trusted only on ac­ count of the pay that he gave them.
23. As to the particulars in which you will be of service to me, some of them you have enumerated, but of the greatest of all I am myself fully conscious;
for though it is permitted to the king alone to wear the turban upright on the head, yet perhaps another than he may, with your assistance, wear that upright which is on the heart.”124.
Tissaphernes, in speaking thus, seemed to Clearchus to speak with sincerity, and he replied, " Do not those, then, who endeavour by calumny to make us enemies, when there are such strong inducements to friendship between us, deserve the severest of punishment?"
23. “ Well, then," said Tissa­ phernes, "if you will come to me, as well generals as captains, in a public manner, I will inform you who they are that tell me that you are forming plots against me and my army."
26. 'I will bring them all," said Clearchus, "and, on my part, will let yon know the quarter whence I hear reports respect­ ing you." 27. After this conversation, Tissaphernes, behav­ ing to Clearchus with much courtesy, desired him to stay with him, and made him his guest at supper.
On the following day, when Clearchus returned to the camp, he plainly showed that he considered himself to be on the most friendly footing with Tissaphernes, and stated what he had proposed ;
and he said that those must go to Tissa­ phernes, whose presence he required, and that whoever of the Greeks should be proved guilty of uttering the alleged calum­ nies, must be punished as traitors, and persons ill-affected to the Greeks.
28. It was Menon that he suspected of making the charges, as he knew that he had had an interview with Tissaphernes in company with Ariæus, and was forming a party and intriguing against himself, in order that, having gained the whole army over to his own interests, lie might secure the friendship of Tissaphernes.
29. Clearchus likewise wished the whole army to have their affections fixed on him­ self, and troublesome rivals to be removed out of his way.
Some of the soldiers urged, in opposition to his advice, that all the captains and generals should not go, and that they ought to place no confidence in Tissaphernes.
30. But Clear­ chus pressed his proposal with great vehemence, till he at length succeeded in getting five generals and twenty captains to go;
and some of the other soldiers followed them, to the number of about two hundred, as if for the purpose of marketing.
131.
When they had arrived at the entrance of Tissaphernes' tent, the general;
, who were Proxenus the Bccotian, Menon the Thessalian, Agias the Arcadian, Clearchus the Lacedæ­ monian, and Socrates the Achæan, were invited to enter;
but the captains waited at the door.
32. Not long after, at one and the same signal, those within were seized, and those with­ out massacred;
and immediately afterwards a body of Bar­ barian cavalry, riding through the plain, killed every Greek, slave or freeman, that they met.
33.
The Greeks, observing the motions of these cavalry from the camp, were filled with astonishment, and wondered what they could be doing, till Nicarchus an Arcadian came fleeing thither, wounded in the belly and holding his intestines in his hands, and related all that had occurred.
34. The Greeks, in consequence, ran to their arms in a state of general consternation, expecting that the enemy would immediately march upon the camp.
35. They however did not all come, but only Ariæus and Artaozus and Mithridates, who had been Cyrus's most confidential friends ;
and the interpreter of the Greeks said, that he saw with them, and recognised, the brother of Tissaphernes.
Other Persians, equipped with corslets, to the number of three hundred, were in attendance on them.
36. As they approached the camp, they called for whatever general or captain of the Greeks might be there, to come out to them, that they might deliver a message from the king.
37. There accordingly went forth to them, with much caution, Cleaner the Orchomenian, and Sophænetus the Stym­ phalian, generals of the Grecks, and with them Xenophon the Athenian, that he might learn news of Proxenus.
As for Cheirisophus, lie happened to be absent at some village look­ in,,, for provisions.
38.
When they had stopped just within hearing, Ariæus said to them:
" Clearchus, 0 Greeks, having been found guilty of perjury, and of violating the truce, has received his just punishment, and is dead ;
Proxenus and Menon, as hav­ ing denounced his treachery, are in great honour;
but the king demands of you your arms ;
for lie says that they are his, as they belonged to Cyrus his subject."
39. To this the Greeks answered, (Cleanor the Orchomenian spoke for them,) " 0 Ariæus, most wicked of men, and the rest of you, as many as were the friends of Cyrus, have you no regard either for gods or men, that, after having sworn that you would consider our friends and enemies to be likewise yours, you have thus,1 after treacherously deserting us in concert with Tissa­ pliernes, the most godless and most unprincipled of human beings, murdered the very men to whom you swore alli­ ance, and, abandoning us who are left, have come against us in conjunction with our enemies?"
40. Ariæus replied, "Clearchus had been previouslydetected in treacherous designs against Tissaphernes and Orontes, and all of us who accom­ pany them."
41. To this Xenophon rejoined, "Clearchus, then, it he infringed the truce in violation of his oath, is de­ serverlly punished;
for it is just that those who violate.
their oaths should suffer death ;
but as for Proxenus and Menon, as they are your benefactors and our generals, send them hither ;
for it is clear that, being friends to both parties, they will endeavour to advise what is best both for you and for us."
42. The Barbarians, after conversing among them­ selves for some time, departed without making any answer to this proposalI.
THE generals, who were thus made prisoners, were takes up to the king, and put to death by being beheaded.
One of them, Clearehus, by the general consent of all who were acquainted with him, appears to have been a man well qualified for war, and extremely fond of military enterprise.
2. For as long as the Lacedæmonians were at war with the Athenians, lie remained in the service of his country;
but when the peace took place, having induced his government to believe that the Thracians were committing ravages on the Greeks, and having gained his point, as well as he could, with the Ephori, he sailed from home to make war upon the Thracians that lie above the Chersonesus and Perin­ thus.
3. But when the Ephori, after he was gone, hav- in.- for some reason changed their mind, took measures to oblige him to turn back from the Isthmus, be then no longer mid obedience to their commands, but sailed away to the Hellespont, 4. and was in consequence condemned to death, for disobedience, by the chief magistrates at Sparta.
Being then an exile, he went to Cyrus;
and by what methods he conciliated the favour of Cyrus, has been told in another place.
Cyrus presented him with ten thousand darics ;
5.
and he, on receiving that sum, did not give himself up to idleness, but having collected an army with the money, made war upon the Thracians, and conquered them in battle, and from that time plundered and laid waste their country, and con­ tinued this warfare till Cyrus had need of his army ;
when he went to him, for the purpose of again making war in COIl­ cert with him.
6.
These seem to me to have been the proceedings of one fond of war, who, when he might have lived in peace without disgrace or loss, chose war in preference ;
when he might have spent his time in idleness, voluntarily underwent toil for the sake of military adventure ;
and when he might have en­ joyed riches in security, chose rather, by engaging in warfare, to diminish their amount.
He was indeed led by inclination to spend his money in war, as he might have spent it in pursuits of gallantry, or any other pleasure ;
to such a degree was he fond of war.
7. He appears also to have been qualified for military undertakings, as he liked perilous adventure, was ready to march day and night against the enemy, and was pos­ sessed of great presence of mind in circumstances of difficulty, as those who were with him on all such occasions were uni­ versally ready to acknowledge.
8.
For commanding troops he was said to be qualified in as great a degree as was consistent with his temper;
for he was excelled by no one in ability to contrive how an army might have provisions, and to procure them ;
and he was equally fitted to impress on all around him the necessity of obeying Clearchus.
9. This he effected by severity ;
for he was of a stern countenance and harsh voice;
and he always punished violently, and sometimes in anger, so that he occa­ sionally repented of what he had done.
He punished too on principle, for he thought that there could be no efficiency in on army undisciplined by chastisement.
10. He is also re- ported to have said, that a soldier ought to fear his commander more than the enemy, if he would either keep guard well, or abstain from doing injury to friends, or march without hesita­ tion against foes.
11. In circumstances of danger, accord­ ingly, the soldiers were willing to obey him implicitly, and wished for no other leader;
for they said, that the sternness in his countenance then assumed an appearance of cheerful­ ness, and that what was severe in it seemed undauntedness against the enemy ;
so that it appeared indicative of safety, and not of austerity.
12. But when they were out of danger, and were at liberty to betake themselves to other chiefs, they de­ serted him in great numbers ;
for he had nothing attractive in him, but was always forbidding and repulsive, so that the soldiers felt towards him as boys towards their master.
13. Hence it was, that lie never hall any one who followed him out of friendship and attachment to his person ;
though such as followed him from being appointed to the service by their country, or from being compelled by want or other necessity, he found extremely submissive to him.
14. And when they began under his command to gain victories over the enemy, there were many important circumstances that concurred to render his troops excellent soldiers ;
for their perfect confi­ dence against the enemy had its effect, and their dread of punishment from him rendered them strictly observant of dis­ cipline.
15. Such was his character as a commander.
But he was said to have been by no means willing to be com­ manded by others.
When he was put to death, he was about fifty years of age.
16, Proxenus the Bœotian.
from his earliest youth, felt a desire to become a man capable of great undertakings ;
and through this desire paid Gorgias of Leontium for instruction.
17. When he had passed some time with him, and thought himself capable of command, and, if honoured with the friendship of the great, of making no inadequate return for their favours, he proceeded to take a part in this enterprise with Cyrus ;
and expected to acquire in it a great name, ex­ tensive influence, and abundant wealth.
IS.
But though he earnestly wished for these things, lie at the same time plainly showed, that he was unwilling to acquire any of them by in­ justice, but that he thought lie ought to obtain them by just and honourable means, or otherwise not at all.
19.
He was indeed able to command orderly and well-dis­ posed men, but incapable of inspiring ordinary soldiers with either respect or fear for him ;
he stood even more in awe of those under his command, than they of him ;
and evidently showed that he was more afraid of being disliked by his sol­ fliers, than his soldiers of being disobedient to him.
20. He thought it sufficient both for being, and appearing, capable of command, to praise turn who did well, and withhold his praise from the offender.
Such, therefore, of his followers, as were of honourable and virtuous character, were much attach­ ed to him, but the unprincipled formed designs upon him, as a man easy to manage.
He was about thirty years old when lie was put to death.
21. As for Menon the Thessalian, he ever manifested an excessive desire for riches, being desirous of command that he might receive greater pay, and desirous of honours that he might obtain greater perquisites ;
and he wished to be well with those in power, in order that when lie did wrong he might not suffer punishment.
22. To accomplish what lie desired, he thought that the shortest road lay through perjury, falsehood, and deceit;
while sincerity and truth he regarded as no better than folly.
23. He evidently had no affection for any man ;
and as for those to whom he professed to be a friend, he was unmistakeably plotting mischief against them.
He never ridiculed an enemy, but always used to talk with his associates as if ridiculing all of them.
1 24.
He formed no designs on the property of his enemies, (for he thought it difficult to take what belonged to such as were on their guard against him,) but looked upon himself as the only person semi.
ible how very easy it was to invade the unguarded property of friends.
25. Those whom he saw given to perjury and injustice, lie feared as men well armed;
but sought to practise on those who were pious and observant of truth, as imbeciles.
26. As another might take a pride in religion, and truth, and justice, so Menon took a pride in being able to deceive, in devising falsehoods, in sneering at friends;
and thought the man who was guileless was to be regarded as deficient in knowledge of the world.
He believed that he must conciliate those, in whose friendship lie wished to stand first, by calumniating such a?
already held the chief place in their favour.
27. The soldier;
he tried to render obedient to him by being an accomplice ir their dishonesty.
lIe expected to be hononred and courted, by showing that he had the power and the will to inflict the greatest injuries.
When any one deserted him, he spoke of it as a favour on his own part that, while lie made use of his services, he did not work his destruction.
28.
As to such parts of his history as are little known, I might, if I were to speak of them, say something untrue of him ;
but those which every one knows, are these.
While yet in the prime of youth he obtained, at the hands of Aristippus, the command of his corps of mercenaries.
He was also, in his prime, most intimate with Ariæus, though a Barbarian, as Ariæus delighted in beautiful youths.
He himself, too, while yet a beardless youth, made a favourite of Tharypas, who had arrived at manhood.
29.
When his fellow-officers were put to death, because they had served with Cyrus against the king, he, though he had done the same, was not put to death with them ;
but after the death of the other generals, he died under a punishment inflicted by the king, not like Clearchus and the other com­ manders, who were beheaded (which appears to be the peediest kind of death):
but after living a year in torture, like a malefactor, he is said at length to have met his end.
30.
Agias the Arcadian and Socrates the Achæan were also put to death.
These no one ever derided as wanting courage in battle, or blamed for their conduct towards their friends
They were both about five and thirty years of age.

1.
WHAT the Greeks did in their march up the country with Cyrus, until the time of the battle, and what occurred after Cyrus was dead, when the Greeks set out to return with Tissaphernes in reliance on a truce, has been related in the preceding part of the work.
2.
After the general;
were made prisoners, and such of the captains and soldiers as had accompanied them were put to death, the Greeks were in great perplexity, reflecting that they were not far from the king's residence ;
1 that there were around them, on all sides, many hostile nations and cities;
that no one would any longer secure them opportunities of purchasing provisions;
that they were distant from Greece not less than ten thousand stadia ;
that there was no one to guide them on the way ;
that impassable rivers would inter­ cept them in the midst of their course;
that the Barbarians who had gone up with Cyrus had deserted them ;
and that they were left utterly alone, having no cavalry to support them, so that it was certain, even if they defeated their one mies, that they would kill not a man of them, and that, if they were defeated, none of themselves would be left alive ;
— 3.
reflecting, I say, on these circumstances, and being dis­ heartened at them, few of them tasted food for that eyening,2 row kindled fires, and many did not come to the place of arms1 during the night, but lay down to rest where they severally happened to be, unable to sleep for sorrow and long­ ing for their country, their parents, their wives and children, whom they never expected to see again.
In this state of mind they all went to their resting-places.
4.
There was in the army a certain Xenophon, an Athe­ nian, who accompanied it neither in the character of general, nor captain, nor common soldier, but it had happened that Prox­ enus, an old guest-friend of his, had sent for him from home, giving him a promise that, if he came, he would recommend him to the friendship of Cyrus, whom he considered, he said, as a greater object of regard than his own country.
5. Xenophon, on reading the letter, consulted Socrates the Athenian, as to the propriety of making the journey;
and Socrates, fearing that if he attached himself to Cyrus it might prove a ground for accusation against him with his country, because Cyrus was thought to have zealously assisted the Lacedæmonians in their war with Athens, advised Xenophon to go to Delphi, and consult the god respecting the expedi­ tion.
6. Xenophon, having gone thither accordingly, inquired of Apollo to which of the gods lie should sacrifice and pray, in order most honourably and successfully to perform the journey which lie contemplated, and, after prosperously ac­ complishing it, to return in safety.
Apollo answered him that "he should sacrifice to the gods to whom it was proper for him to sacrifice."
2 7. When he returned, he repeated the oracle to Socrates, who, on hearing it, blamed him for not asking Apollo in the first place, whether it were better for him to go or stay at homo ;
whereas, having settled with him­ self that lie would go, he only asked how he might best go;
" but since you have," said he, "put the question thus, you must do what the god has directed."
8. Xenophon, there­ fore, having sacrificed to the gods that Apollo commanded, set sail, and found Proxenus and Cyrus at Sardis, just setting out on their march up the country, and was presented to Cyrus.
9. Proxenus desiring that he should remain with them, Cyrus joined in the same desire, and said that as soon as the expedition was ended, lie would send him home again.
The expedition was said to be intended against the Pisidians.
tO.
Xenophon accordingly joined in the enterprise, being thus deceived, but not by Proxenus ;
for he did not know that the movement was against the king, nor did any other of the Greeks, except Clearchus.
When they arrived in Cilicia, however, it appeared manifest to everyone that it was against the king that their force was directed ;
but, though they were afraid of the length of the journey, und unwilling to proceed, yet the greater part of them, out of respectI both for one another and for Cyrus, continued to follow him;
of which number was Xenophon.
11.
When this perplexity occurred, Xenophon was distressed as well as the other Greeks, and unable to rest, but having at length got a little sleep, he had a dream, in which, in the midst of a thunder-storm, a bolt seemed to him to fall upon his father's house, and the house in consequence became all in a blaze.
12. Being greatly frightened, he immediately awoke, and considered his dream as in one respect favourable, (inasmuch as, being in troubles and dangers, he seemed to be­ hold a great light from Jupiter,) but in another respect he was alarmed, (because the dream appeared to him to be from Ju­ piter who was a king, and the fire to blaze all around him,) lest he should be unable to escape from the king'a territories, but should be hemmed in on all sides by inextricable difficulties.
13.
What it betokens, however, to see such a dream, we may conjecture from the occurrences that happened after the dream.
What immediately followed was this.
As soon as lie awoke, the thought that first occurred to him was, "Why do I lie here ?
The night is passing away.
With daylight it is pro­ bable that the enemy will come upon us ;
and if we once fall into the hands of the king, what is there to prevent us from being put to death with ignominy, after witnessing the most grievous sufferings among our comrades, and enduring every severity of torture ourselves ?
14. Yet no one concerts mea­ sures, or takes thought, for our defence, but we lie still, as if we were at liberty to enjoy repose.
From what city, then, do I expect a leader to undertake our defence ?
What age am I wailing for to come to myself?
Assuredly I shall never be older, if I give myself up to the enemy to-day."
15. Aftei these reflections lie arose, and called together, in the first place, the captains that were under Proxenus.
When they were assembled, lie said, " For my part, captains, I cannot sleep, nor, I should think, can you, nor can I lie still any longer, when I consider in what circumstances we are placed ;
16.
for it is plain that the enemy did not openly manifest hostility towards us, until they thought that they had judiciously arranged their plans ;
but on our side no one takes any thought how we may best maintain a contest with them.
17. Yet if we prove remits, and fall into the power of the king, what may we not expect to suffer from a man who cut off the head and hand of his own brother by the same mother and father, even after he was dead, and fixed them upon a stake ?
What may not we, I say, expect to suffer, who have no relative1 to take our part, and who have marched against him to make him a subject instead of a mon­ arch, and to put him to death if it should lie in our power ?
IS.
Will he not proceed to every extremity, that by reducing us to the last degree of ignominious suffering, he may inspire all meli with a dread of ever taking the field against him ?
We it.
ist however try every expedient not to fall into his hands.
to.
For myself, I never ceased, while the truce lasted, to consider ourselves as objects of pity, and to regard the king and his people as objects of envy, as I contemplated how extensive and valuable a country they possessed, how great an abundance of provisions, how many slaves and cattle, and how vast a quantity of gold and raiment ;
20.
while, on the other hand, when I reflected on the condition of our own soldiers, that we had no share in any of all these blessings, unless we bought it, and knew that few of us had any longer money to buy, and that our oaths restrained us from getting provisions otherwise than by buying, I sometimes, on taking all these circumstances into consideration, feared the continu­ ance of peace more than I now fear war.
21. But since they have put an end to peace, their own haughtiness, and our mistrust, seem likewise to be brought to an end ;
for the advantages which I have mentioned lie now as prizes between us, for whichsoever of us shall prove the better men ;
and the gods are the judges of the contest, who, as is just, will be on our side ;
22.
since the enemy have offended them by perjury, while we, though seeing many good things to tempt us, have resolutely abstained from all of them through regard to our oaths;
so that, as it seems to me, we may advance to the combat with much greater confidence than they can feel.
23. We have bodies, moreover, better able than theirs to endure cold and heat and toil ;
and we have, with the help of the gods, more resolute minds;
while the enemy, if the gods, as before, grant us success, will be found more obnoxious to wounds and death 1 than we are.
24. But possibly others of you en­ tertain the same thoughts ;
let us not, then, in the name of heaven, wait for others to come and exhort us to noble deeds, but let us be ourselves the first to excite others to exert their valour.
Prove yourselves the bravest of the captains, and more worthy to lead than those who are now leaders.
25. As for me, if you wish to take the start in the course, I am willing to follow you, or, if you appoint me to be a leader, I shall not make my youth an excuse, but shall think myself sufficiently mature to defend myself against harm."26.
Thus spoke Xenophon;
and the captains, on hearing his observations, all desired him to be their leader, except a certain Apollonides, who resembled a Bœotian in his manner of speaking ;
this man said that "whoever asserted they could gain safety by any other means than by obtaining, if he could, the king's consent to it, talked absurdly;
" and at the same time began to enumerate the difficulties surrounding them.
27. But Xenophon, interrupting him, said, " 0 most wonder­ ful of men !
you neither understand what you see, nor remem­ ber what you hear.
Yet you were on the same spot with those here present, when the king, after Cyrus was dead, being in high spirits at the circumstance, sent to demand that we should deliver up our arms ;
28.
and when we, refusing to de­ liver them up, and appearing in full armour, went and en­ camped over against him, what means did he not try, sending deputies, asking for a truce, and supplying us with provisions until he obtained a truce ?
29. But when, on the other hand, our general,;
and captains went to confer with the Barbarians, as you now advise us to do, without their arms, and relying on the truce, were they not beaten, goaded, insulted, and are they not unable, wretched men, to die, though, I should think, greatly longing for death ?
And do you, knowing all these occurrences, say that those who exhort us to defend ourselves talk absurdly, and advise us to go again to try persuasion?
so.
To me, 0 captains, it seems that we should no longer ad­ iit this man into the same service with ourselves, but take from him his captaincy, and laying baggage on his back, make use of him in that capacity;
for lie disgraces both his own country and all Greece, inasmuch as, being a Greek, he is of such a character."
31. Here Agasias of Stymphalus, pro­ ceeding to speak, said, " But this man, assuredly, has nothing to do either with Bœotia or with Greece at all, for I have ob­ served that he has both his cars bored, like a Lydian."
Such indeed was the ease ;
and they accordingly expelled him.
32. The rest, proceeding to the different divisions of the troops, called up the general wherever there was a general surviving, and the lieutenant-general!
where the geneial was dead, and the captain wherever there was a captain sur living.
33. When they were all come together, they sat down before the place where the arms were piled ;
2 and the generals a. cap­ tains assembled were about a hundred in all.
The time when the meeting took place was about midnight34.
Hieronymus, a native of Elis, the oldest of all the cap­ tains that had served under Proxenus, was the first to speak, as follows :
"
It has seemed proper to us, 0 generals and cap­ tains, on contemplating the present state of OUt.
affairs, to meet together ourselves, and to call upon you to join us, that we may determine, if we can, on some plan for our benefit.
But do you, Xenophon, first represent to the assembly what you have already observed to us."
35. Xenophon accordingly said, " We are all aware that the king and Tissaphernes have made prisoners of as many of us as they could ;
and it is evident that they are forming designs against the rest of us, that they may put us to death if they can.
But on our parts I think that every means should be adopted in order that we may not fall into the Barbarians' hands, but rather that they, if we can accomplish it, may fall into ours.
36. Be well assured then, that you, who have now met together in such numbers, have upon you a most important responsibility ;
1 for all the soldiers look to yeu, and, if they see you dispirited, they will them­ selves lose courage, but if both you yourselves appear well prepared to meet the enemy, and exhort others to be equally prepared, be certain that they will follow you, and strive to imitate you.
37. Perhaps, too, it is right that you should show some superiority over them ;
for you are their generals, their officers, and their captains, and, when there was peace, you enjoyed advantages over them in fortune and honour:
and now, in consequence, when war arises, you ought to prove yourselves pre-eminent over the multitude, and to take the lead in forming plans for them, and, should it ever be neces­ sary, in toiling for them.
38. And, in the first place, I think that you will greatly benefit the army, if you take care that generals and captains be chosen as soon as possible in the room of those whom we have lost;
for without commanders nothing honourable or advantageous can be achieved, I may say in one word, anywhere, but least of all in the field of battle.
Good order conduces to safety, but want of order has al­ ready proved fatal to many.
39. Again, when you have ap­ pointed as many commanders as are requisite, I consider that if you were to assemble and encourage the rest of the soldiers, you would act very suitably to the occasion ;
40.
for you perhaps observe, as well as myself, how dejectedly they have now come to the place of arms,1 and how dejectedly they go upon guard, so that, while they are in such a condition, I know not for what service anyone could employ them, whether required by night or by day.
41. But if any one could change the direction of their thoughts, so that they may not merely contemplate what they are likely to suffer, but what they may be able to do, they will become much more eager for action ;
42.
for you are certain that it is neither numbers nor strength which gives the victory in war, but that whichsoever side advances on the enemy with the more resolute courage, their opponents, in general, cannot withstand their onset.
43. I have also remarked, fellow-soldiers, that such as are eager in the field to preserve their lives at any rate, for the most part perish wretchedly and ignominiously, while I see that such as reflect that death is to all men common and inevitable, and seek in battle only to fall with honour, more frequently, from whatever cause, arrive at old age, and live, while they live, with greater happiness.
44. Being aware, then, of these facts, it behoves us, such are the circumstances in which we are placed, both to prove ourselves to be brave soldiers, and to exhort others to be so likewise."
45. Having spoken thus, he stopped.
After him Cheirisophus said, " Till the present moment, 0 Xenophon, I knew nothing of you, except having heard that you were an Athenian, but now I have to praise you both for what you say and what you do, and could wish that there were very many like you ;
for it would be a general good.
4G. And now," lie added, "let us not delay, my fellow-soldiers, but proceed at once, you who want them, to choose commanders, and when you have elected them, come to the centre of the camp, and bring those that are chosen ;
and we will then call the rest of the soldiers together there.
And let Tolmides the herald," said he, "come with us." 47. As he said this, he rose up, that the necessary measures might not be delayed, but carried at once into execution.
There were accordingly chosen commanders, Timasion a Dardanian in the room of Clearchus, Xanthicles an Achæan in that of Socrates, Cleanor an Arcadian in that of Agias, Philesius an Achæan in that of Menon, and Xenophon of Athens in that of Proxenus.
The new generals hold a council of war.
The speeches of Cheirisophus, Cleanor, and Xenophon.
The order of march is settled, and the duti of each commander appointed.
I.
WHEN the officers were chosen, and day was just dawning, they met in the centre of the camp, and it was resolved to sta­ tion sentinels at the out-posts, and to call together the soldiers.
When the rest of the troops came up, Cheirisophus the Lacedæmonian rose first, and spoke as follows :
2. " Our pre­ sent circumstances, fellow-soldiers, are fraught with difficulty, since we are deprived of such able generals, and captains, and soldiers, and since, also, the party of Arianus, who were for­ merly our supporters, have deserted us ;
3.
yet it behoves us to extricate ourselves from these difficulties as brave men, and not to lose courage, but to endeavour to save ourselves, if we can, by an honourable victory ;
but if we cannot do so, let us at least die with honour, and never, while we live, put ourselves into the power of the enemy ;
for I think that, in that case, we should endure such sufferings as I wish that the gods may inflict on our adversaries.
"4. After him Cleaner the Orchomenian arose and spoke thus:
"You see, soldiers, the perjury and impiety of the king ;
and you see also the faithlessness of Tissaphernes, who, after telling us that he was a neighbour of the Greeks, and would esteem it the highest privilege to save us, and after having given us his right hand as a pledge, has himself de­ ceived and made prisoners our generals, and has not respected even Jupiter, the protector of the rights of hospitality, but, entertaining Clearchus at his own table, has, by this very means, inveigled and destroyed our officers.
5. Ariæus, too, whom we offered to make king, to whom we gave and from whom we received pledges, that we would not betray one another, even he, neither fearing the gods, nor respecting the memory of Cyrus.
though honoured by him in the highest degree while he was alive, has now gone over to his bitterest enemies, and endeavours to distress us who were his friends.
6. But on these men may the gods take vengeance ;
for ourselves, it is incumbent upon us, having this conduct before our eyes, not to be deceived again by them, but, after fighting as bravely as we can, to bear with patience such fortune as the gods may appoint us.
"7. Next stood up Xenophon, who had accoutred himself tor war as splendidly as he could, thinking that if the gods should grant them victory, the finest equipment would be suitable to success, or that, if it were appointed for him to die, it would be well for him to adorn himself with his best armour,1 and in that dress to meet his end.
He pro­ ceeded to speak thus :
8. " Of the perjury and perfidy of the Barbarians Cleanor has just spoken, and you, I am sure, are well aware of it.
If, then, we think of coming again to term?
of friendship with them, we must of necessity feel much dis­ trust on that head, when we see what our generals have suf­ fered, who, in reliance on their faith, put themselves into their hands ;
but if we propose to inflict on them vengeance with our swords for what they have done, and, for the future, to be at war with them at all points, we have, with the help of the gods, many fair hopes of safety."
9. As he was uttering these words, somebody sneezed, and the soldiers, hearing it, with one impulse paid their adoration to the god ;
2 and Xenophon continued, " Since, soldiers, while we were speaking of safety, an omen from Jupiter the Preserver has appeared, it seems to me that we should vow to that god to offer sacrifices for our preservation on the spot where we first reach a friendly country;
and that we should vow, at the same time, to sacri­ lice to the other gods according to our ability.
And to whom­ soever this seems reasonable, let him hold up his hand."
All held up their hands ;
and they then made their vows, and sang the pæan.
When the ceremonies to the gods were duly per­ formed, he recommenced thus:
10.
"I was saying that we had many fair hopes of safety.
In the first place, we have observed our oaths made to the gods;
but the enemy have perjured themselves, and broken the truce and their oaths.
Such being the case, it is natural that the gods should be un­ favourable to our enemies, and should fight on our side;
the gods, who are able, whenever they will, to malo the mighty soon weak, and to save the weak with case, although they be in grievous perils.
11. In the next place, I will remind you of the dangers in which our ancestors were, that you may feel conscious how much it becomes you to be brave, and how the brave are preserved, even from the greatest troubles, by the aid of the gods.
For when the Persians, and those united with them, came with a numerous host, as if to sweep Athens from the face of the earth, 1 the Athenians, by daring to oppose them, gave them a defeat;
12.
and having made a vow to Diana, that whatever number they should kill of the enemy, they would sacrifice to her divinity the same number of goats, and not being able to find enough, they resolved to sacrifice five hundred every year ;
and to this day they still continue to sacrifice them.
13. Again, when Xerxes, having collected that innumerable army of his, came down upon Greece a se­ cond time, our ancestors on that occasion, too, defeated the ancestors of these Barbarians, both by land and sea ;
of which exploits the trophies are still to be seen as memorials;
the greatest of all memorials, however, is the liberty of the states in which you were born and bred, for you worship no man as master, but the gods alone.
Of such ancestors are you sprung.14. " Nor am I going to say that you dishonour them.
It is not yet many days since you arrayed yourselves in the field against the descendants of those Barbarians, and defeated, with the help of the gods, a force many times more numerous than yourselves.
15. On that occasion you showed yourselves brave men to procure a throne for Cyrus ;
and now, when the struggle is for your own lives, it becomes rou to be more valiant and resolute.
16. At present, too, you may justly feel greater confidence against your adversaries ;
for even then, when you had made no trial of them, and saw them in count- less numbers before you, you yet dared, with the spirit of your fathers, to advance upon them, and now, when you have learned from experience of them, that, though many times your number, they shrink from receiving your charge, what reason have you any longer to fear them ?
17. And do not consider it any disadvantage, that the troops of Cyrus, who were formerly arrayed on our side, have now left us;
for they are far more cowardly than those who were defeated by you ;
at least1 they deserted us to flee to them, and those who are so ready to commence flight it is better to see posted on the side of the enemy than in our own ranks.is.
"If, again, any of you are disheartened because we have no cavalry, and the enemy have a great number, con­ sider that ten thousand cavalry are nothing more than ten thousand men;
for no one ever perished in battle of being bitten or kicked by a horse ;
it is the men that do whatever is done in the encounter.
19. Doubtless we, too, rest upon a surer support than cavalry have, for they are raised upon horses, and are afraid, not only of us, but also of falling, while we, taking our steps upon the ground, shall strike such as ap­ proach us with far greater force, and hit much more surely the mark at which we may aim.
In one point alone, indeed, have the cavalry the advantage, that it is safer for them to flee than for us.20. “
But if, though you have courage for battle, you are disquieted at the thought that Tissaphernes will no longer guide you, and that the king will no longer supply you with provisions, consider whether it is better to have Tissaphernes for cur guide, who is manifestly plotting our destruction, or such persons as we ourselves may seize and compel to be our guides, who will be conscious that if they go wrong with re­ gard to us, they go wrong with regard to their own lives and persons.
21. And as to provisions, whether is it better for us to purchase, in the markets which they provide, small measures of food for large sums of money, (no longer, indeed, having the money,) or, if we are successful in the field, to take supplies for ourselves, adopting whatever measure each of us may wish to use ?22. "
Again, if you think, that this state of things will be better, but imagine that the rivers will be impassable, and that you were greatly misled when you came across them, reflect whether the Barbarians have not acted most unwisely also in this respect.
1
For an rivers, though they may be impassable at a distance from their sources, are easy to be forded by those who go to their springs, wetting them not even to the knees.
23. But even if the rivers shall not afford us a passage,2 and no guide skill appear to conduct us, we still need not be in despair ;
for we know that the Mysians, whom we should not call more valiant than ourselves, have settled themselves, against the king's will, in many rich and large cities in the king's territory ;
we know that the Pisi­ dians have acted similarly ;
and we have ourselves seen3 that the Lycaonians, having seized on the strongholds in the plains, enjoy the produce of the land of these Barbarians ;
24.
and I should recommend that we, for the present, should not let it be seen that we are eager to start homewards, but should apparently make arrangements as if we thought of settling somewhere in these parts;
for I am sure that the king would grant the Mysians many guides, and give them many hostages to send them out of the country safely, and even make roads for them, though they should desire to depart in four­ horse chariots ;
and for ourselves, too, I am convinced that he would with thrice as much pleasure do the same, if he saw us making dispositions to remain here.
25. But I am afraid t hat if we should once learn to live in idleness, to revel in abundance, and to associate with the fair and stately wives and daughters of the Medes and Persians, we should, like the lotus-eaters,1 think no more of the road homewards.
26. It seems to me, therefore, both reasonable and just, that we should first of all make an attempt to return to Greece, and to the members of our families, and let our countrymen see that they live in voluntary poverty, since they might see those, who are now living at home without due means of subsistence, enriched on betaking themselves hither.
But I need say no more on this head, for it is plain, my fellow-soldiers, that all these advantages fall to the conquerors.
27.
“I must also suggest to you, however, in what mannei we may proceed on our way with the greatest safety, and how we may fight, if it should be necessary to fight, to the greatest possible advantage.
First of all, then," he continued, “it seems to me that we ought to burn whatever carriages we have, that our cattle may not influence our movements, but that we may march whithersoever it may be convenient for the army ;
and then that we should burn our tents with them, for tents are troublesome to carry, and of no service either for fighting or in getting provisions.
28. I think also that we ought to rid ourselves of whatever is superfluous in the rest of our baggage, reserving only what we have for war, or for meat and drink, that as many of us as possible may be under arms, and as few as possible baggage-bearers;
for you are aware that whatever belongs to the conquered becomes the property of others;
and, if we are victorious, we ought to look upon the enemy as our baggage-carriers.
29.
“It only remains for me to mention a particular which I consider to be of the greatest importance.
You see that the enemy did not venture openly to commence war against us, until they had seized our generals, thinking that as long as we had commanders, and were obedient to them, we should be in a condition to gain the advantage over them in the field, but, on making prisoners of our generals, they expected that we should perish from want of direction and order.
30. It is incumbent, therefore, on our present commanders to be far more vigilant than our former ones, and on those under com-The trees around them all their food poduce, Lotus the name, divine nectareons juice, (Thence called Lotophagi,) which whoso tastes, insatiate riots in the sweet repasts, Nor other home, nor other care intends, But quits his house, his country.
and his friends.
Pope.mand to be far more orderly, and more obedient to their officers, at present than they were before.
31. And if you were also to pass a resolution, that, should any one be dis­ obedient, whoever of you chances to light upon him is to join with his officer in punishing him, the enemy would by that means be most effectually disappointed in their expectations, for, on the very day that such resolution is passed, they will see before them ten thousand Clearehuses instead of one, who will not allow a single soldier to play the coward.
32. But it is now time for me to conclude my speech ;
1 for in an instant perhaps the enemy will be upon us.
Whosoever, therefore, thinks these suggestions reasonable, let him give his sanction to them at once, that they may be carried into execution.
But if any other course, in any one's opinion, be better than this,2 let him, even though he be a private soldier, boldly give us his sentiments;
for the safety, which we all seek, is a ge­ neral concern."33.
Cheirisophus then said, “Should there be need of any other measure in addition to what Xenophon proposes, it will be in our power to bring it forward by and by ;
what he has now suggested we ought, I think, to vote at once to be the best course that we can adopt;
and to whomsoever this seems proper, let him hold up his hand ;
” and they all held them up.
34. Xenophon then, rising again, said, “Hear, soldiers, what appears to me to be necessary in addition to what I have laid before you.
It is plain that we must march to some place from which we may get provisions ;
and I hear that there are some good-looking villages not more than twenty stadia dis­ tant ;
35.
but I should not wonder if the enemy, (like cowardly dogs that run after such as pass by them, and bite them if they can, but flee from those who pursue them,) I should not wonder, I say, if the enemy were to follow close upon us when we begin to march.
36. It will, perhaps, be the safer way for us to march, therefore, forming a hollow square of the heavy- armed troops, in order that the baggage and the large number of camp-followers may be in greater security within it ;
and if it be now settled who is to lead the square, and regu­ late the movements in front, who arc to be on each flank, and who to have charge of the rear, we shall not have to consider of these things when the enemy approach, but may at once act according to what has been arranged.
37. If, then, any one else sees anything better to recommend, let it be settled other­ wise ;
if not, let Cheirisophus lead, since he is also a Lacedæ­ monian ;
1 let two of the oldest generals take the command on each of the flanks;
and let Timasion and myself, the youngest of the officers, take charge, at least for the present, of the rear.
38. After a time, when we have tried this arrangement, we will consider, as occasion may require, what may seem best to be done.
If any one thinks of any better.
plan than this, let him speak."
As nobody made any objection, he said, " Whosoever likes these proposals, let him hold up his hand."
The pro­ posals were approved.
39. “And now," lie added, “it be­ longs to you to go and carry into execution what has been decided upon ;
and whosoever of you wishes to see his friends and relations, let him prove himself a man of valour, for by no other means can lie succeed in attaining that object;
who­ ever of you desires to preserve his life, let him strive to con­ quer, for it is the part of conquerors to kill, but of the con­ quered to die;
and if any one of you covets spoil, let him endeavour to secure victory for us, for it is the privilege of victors at once to save their own property and to seize on that of the vanquished.
”
The Greeks are visited oy Mithridates as a friend, but lie soon shows that he is an enemy, and they resolve to enter into no further negotiations with the Persian king.
They pass the Zabatus, are harassed by Mithridates, and suffer from the want of slingers and cavalry.
Volunteers are enrolled for these services.1. WHEN this speech was concluded, they rose up, and went off to burn their carriages and tents ;
of their superflu- ous baggage they divided among themselves such portions as any needed, and threw the rest into the fire.
Having done this, they went to breakfast.
While they were at their meal, Mithridates rode up to them with about thirty horsemen and requesting the generals to come within hearing, spoke as fol­ lows:
2. " I was faithful to Cyrus, 0 men of Greece, as you yourselves know ;
I am now well disposed towards you;
and I am living here under great apprehensions;
if therefore I should find that you are concerting any safe scheme for your deliverance, I would come and join you, bringing with me all my followers.
Let me know, therefore, what you have in con­ templation, as one who is your friend and well-wisher, and who is willing to march along with you."
3. The general.?, after consulting together, resolved on returning the following answer;
and Cheirisophus delivered it:
"It is our deter­ mination, if no one hinders us from returning home, to pro­ ceed through the country with as little injury to it as possible;
but if any one opposes us on our march, to fight our way against him as vigorously as we can."
4. Mithridates then endeavoured to convince them how impracticable it was to escape without the king's consent.
But it was now concluded that he was insidiously sent;
for one of the followers of Tis­ saphernes was in attendance on him to insure his fidelity.'
5. In consequence, it was thought right by the generals to pass a resolution that the war should be such as to admit of no intercourse by heralds ;
2 for those that came tried to cor­ rupt the soldiers, and succeeded in seducing one of the cap­ tains, Nicarchus an Arcadian, and he deserted in the night with about twenty men.6.
Having then dined, and crossed the river Zabatus, they marched on in regular order, keeping the baggage-cattle and camp-followers in the centre.
But before they had gone far, Mithridates made his appearance again with about two hun­ dred cavalry and about four hundred archers and slingers, very light and active troops.
7. He advanced towards the Greeks as a friend, but, when he came near, some of his men, both horse and foot, suddenly discharged their arrows, and others used their slings, and wounded some of our men.
The rear of the Greeks indeed was much harassed, and could do nothing in return ;
for the Cretan bowmen shot to a less dis­ tance than the Persians, and had also, as being lightly armed, sheltered themselves within the heavy troops;
and the javelin- men did not hurl far enough to reach the slingers.
8. Upon this it seemed to Xenophon that it would be well to pursue them ;
and such of the heavy-armed and peltasts as happened to be with him in the rear, began to pursue, but could over­ take in the pursuit not a single man of the enemy;
9. for the Greeks had no cavalry,1 nor could their infantry, in a short distance, overtake the infantry of the enemy, who took to flight when they were a long way off, since it was impossible for the Greeks to follow them to a great distance from the rest of the army.
10. The Barbarian cavalry, too, inflicted wounds in their retreat, shooting backwards as they rode, and however far the Greeks advanced in pursuit, so far were they obliged to retreat fighting, 11.
Thus during the whole day they did not advance more than five-and-twenty stadia;
however, they arrived at the villages in the evening.
Here again there was much dejection ;
and Cheirisophus and the oldest of the generals blamed Xenophon for pursuing the enemy apart from the main body, endangering himself, and yet being unable to hurt the assailants.
12. Xenophon, hearing this charge, acknowledged that they blamed him justly, and that the result bore testimony in their favour.
" But," said he, " I was under the necessity of pursuing, as I saw that we suffered great damage while remaining at our posts, and were unable to retaliate.
13. But when we began to pursue," continued lie, "the truth was as you say;
for we were none the better able to injure the enemy, and we could not retreat without great difficulty.
14. Thanks are due to the gods, therefore, that the Barbarians did not come upon us in great force, but only with a few troops, so that, whilst they did us no great harm, they showed us of what we stand in need:
15.
for at present the enemy shoot their arrows and sling their stones such a distance, that neither can the Cretans return their shots, nor can those who throw with the hand reach them;
and when we pursue them, we cannot go after them any great distance from the main body, and in a short space a foot-soldier, even if ever so swift, cannot overtake another foot-soldier, starting at bow-shot distance.
16. It therefore we would keep off the enemy, so that they may be unable to hurt us on our march, we must at once provide our­ selves with slingers and cavalry.
There are, I hear, some Rhodians in our army, the greater number of whom, they say, understand the use of the sling, while their weapon carries even double the distance of the Persian sling, 17.
which, as they sling with large stones, reach only a short distance, while the Rhodians know how to use leaden bullets.
is.
If then, we ascertain which of them have slings, and give money to each of them1 for them ;
and pay money also to any one who is willing to plait more, and find some other privilege2 for him who consents to serve in the troop of slingers,3 possi­ bly some will offer themselves who may be able to be of ser­ vice to us.
19. I see also that there are horses in the army, some in my possession, and some left by Clearchus, besides many others taken from the enemy which arc employed in carrying the baggage.
If, then, we collect all these, and put ordinary baggage-cattle in their place, and equip the horses for riders, they will perhaps annoy the enemy in their flight."
20. These suggestions were approved ;
and that very night there came forward slingers to the number of two hundred.
The next day, as many as fifty horsemen and horses were pronounced fit for service ;
leathern jackets4 and breastplates were furnished to them ;
and Lycius the son of Polystratus an Athenian, was appointed their captain.
Mithridates again pursues the Greeks, but is repulsed.
They reach the Tigris, encamp at Mespila, and are attacked by Tissaphernes with a nu­ merous force.
They repel him, and alter their order of march.
Traversing a mountainous part of the country, they arc harassed by the enemy, till, on getting possession of a height, they are enabled to reach the plain be yond it in safety.
1.
HAVING halted for that day, they went forward on the next, rising earlier in the morning than usual;
for they had a ravine formed by a torrent to pass, at which they were afraid that the enemy would attack them while they were crossing.
2. It was not till they had got over, however, that Mithridates again made his appearance, having now with him a thousand horse, and archers and slingers to the number of four thousand ;
for he had solicited and obtained that number from Tissaphernes, promising that, if lie received them, he would deliver the Greeks into his hands ;
for he had con­ ceived a contempt for them, because, in his previous attack on them, though he had but a small force with him, he had suffered no loss, and thought that he had caused them great annoyance.
3. When the Greeks, having crossed, were dis­ tant about eight stadia from the ravine, Mithridates also passed over it with his force.
Instructions had been issued to such of the peltasts and heavy-armed troops as were to pursue, and a charge had been given to the horsemen to pur­ sue with boldness, as a sufficient force would follow to support them.
4. When therefore Mithridates overtook them, and the slings and arrows began to take effect, a signal was given to the Greeks with the trumpet, and those who had been or­ dered immediately hastened to charge the enemy, the cavalry riding forward at the same time.
The enemy however did not wait to receive their charge, but fled back to the ravine.
5. In the pursuit several of the Barbarian foot were killed, and about eighteen of the horse were made prisoners in the defile.
The Greeks, of their own impulse, mutilated the dead bodies, in order that the sight of them might be as horrible as possible to the enemy.
6.
The enemy, after faring thus, went off, and the Greeks, advancing the rest of the day without molestation, arrived at the river Tigris.
7. Here was a large deserted city, the name of which was Larissa, and which the Modes had formerly in­ habited.
The breadth of its wall was five and twenty feet, and the height of it a hundred ;
its circuit was two parasangs.
It was built of bricks made of clay, but there was under it a stone foundation,!
the height of twenty feet.
8. This city the king of the Persians,2 at the time when the Persians wrested3 the empire from the Modes, was unable by any means to take ;
a cloud, however, having covered the sun, hid it from view,4 till the people deserted it,1 and so it was taken.
9. Near the city was a stone pyramid, of the breadth2 of one plethrum, and the height of two plethra.
Upon it3 were many of the Barbarians who had fled from the neighbouring villages.
10.
Hence they proceeded one day's journey, six parasangs, to a large unoccupied fortress,4 situated near a city, the name of which was Mespila;
the Modes had formerly inhabited it.
The foundation of the wall was of polished stone, full of shells,5 the breadth fifty feet, and the height fifty ;
11.
and on it was constructed a wall of bricks, fifty feet broad, and a hundred high ;
the circumference of it was six parasangs.
Here Medea, the king's wife, is said to have taken refuge, when the Medes were deprived of their empire by the Per­ sians.
12. The king of the Persians, on besieging this city, was unable to reduce it either by length of time or by assault, but Jupiter, as with a thunder-stroke,6 deprived the inhabit­ ants of their senses, and thus it was taken.
13.
Hence they proceeded one day's journey, a distance of four parasangs.
In the course of this day's march Tissaphernes made his appearance, having with him the cavalry which he himself commanded, the force of Orontes, who had married the king's daughter,7 the Barbarian troops with which Cyrus went up, the troops with which the king's brother came to assist him, and, besides these, all that the king himself had given him ;
so that his army appeared extremely numerous.
14. When lie came near, he stationed some of his companies in the rear, and brought others round upon our flanks, but did not venture to make a charge, or show any disposition to endanger himself, but ordered his men to use their slings and bows.
15. But when the Rhodians, who were dispersed among the ranks, began to use their slings, and the Scythian archers1 dis­ charged their arrows, no one failing to hit a man, (for it would not have been easy to do so, even if they had been ever so desirous,) Tissaphernes hastily retreated beyond reach of the missiles, and the other divisions drew off at the same time.
16. During the rest of the day the Greeks continued their march, and the enemy followed;
but the Barbarians no longer harassed them with their usual skirmishing ;
for the Rhodians sent their missiles to a greater distance than the Persians.
and than most of the bowmen.
17. The bows of the Persians, too, were large, so that such of their arrows as were taken up, were of service to the Cretans, who continued to use the enemy's arrows, and practised shooting by sending them far up into the air.2
A great number of bowstrings were also found in the villages, and some lead, so that they could use it for their slings.is.
For that day, therefore, as soon as the Greeks reached the villages and encamped, the Barbarians went off, having had the worst in the skirmish ;
and during the next the Greeks remained where they were, and collected provisions, for there was plenty of corn in the villages.
The day after, they proceeded through the open country, and Tissaphernes followed, hurling missiles at them from a distance.
19. Here the Greeks found that a square was a bad disposition for au army when the enemy was behind them;
for it must neces­ sarily happen, that if the flanks of the square close together from the road being narrow, or from hills or a bridge making it necessary, that the heavy-armed men must be pushed out of their places, and march with difficulty,' being at the same time crowded together and thrown into confusion ;
so that when in such disorder they must be nearly useless.
20. And when, again, the flanks divide, those who were previously forced out of their places, must now of necessity separate, and the space between the flanks be left empty;
and men who are thrown into such a condition must doubtless lose heart, if the enemy are behind them.
Whenever, too, they had to pass a bridge, or any other crossing-place, each hastened on to get first, and the enemy had then a fine opportunity of attacking them.
2 21. The generals, seeing that such was the case, formed six companies of a hundred men each, and appointed captains of these companies, as well as captains of fifty and captains of twenty-five.
3
These captains and their companies, on the march, whenever the flanks of the square closed together, fell behind, so as to cause no disorder in the flanks, and then led on outside the flanks;
22.
and whenever the sides of the square opened, they filled up the centre, if the opening was narrow, by companies ;
if rather wide, by fifties ;
if very wide, by twenty-fives;
4 so that the centre was always full.
23. If, then, it was necessary to pass any defile or bridge, they were not thrown into confusion, but the captains and companies went over in succession;
5 and if anything was needed in any part of the main body, these were at hand.
In this order they advanced four days'journey.
24.
As they were pursuing the fifth day's march, they ob­ served a kind of palace, and several villages round it.
The way to this place, they perceived, lay among high hills, which reached down from a mountain, at the foot of which the vil­ lage was.
1
These hills the Greeks were glad to see, as was natural, when the enemy's force consisted of cavalry.
25. But when, after leaving the plain, they had ascended the first hill, and were descending in order to mount the second, the Barbarians came upon them, and from the eminence began, under the lash,2 to hurl darts, use their slings, and shoot arrows, on the ground below;
26.
they wounded many, and had the advantage over the light-armed Greeks, and shut them up within the heavy-armed ;
so that both the slingers and archers were that day entirely useless, being mixed with the crowd that had charge of the baggage.
27. When the Greeks, on being hard pressed, attempted pursuit, they mounted the height but slowly, as being heavily armed, while the enemy sprang up speedily.
28. When, again, they re­ treated back to the rest of the force, they fared equally ill.
The same occurrences took place on the second hill;
so that they thought it proper not to move the soldiers from the third hill, until they led up a body of peltasts to the mountain from the right wing of the square.
29. When these had got above the pursuing enemy, they no longer attacked them in their descent, fearing that they might be cut off from their own body, and that enemies might assail them on both sides.
30. Marching in this manner for the rest of the day, some by the route among the hills, and others advancing abreast of them along the mountain, they arrived at the villages, and ap­ pointed eight surgeons,1 for there were many wounded.
31.
Here they remained three days, both for the sake of the wounded, and because they found, at the same time, abund­ ance of provisions, wheat-flour, wine, and a great quantity of barley laid up for horses;
supplies which had been col­ lected for the satrap of the country.
On the fourth day they went down into the plain.
32. But as Tissaphernes overtook them with his forces, necessity taught them to en­ camp where they first saw a village, and not to march on still fighting;
for there were many unfitted for action, some wounded, some carrying the wounded, and some bearing the arms of those that carried them.
33. When however they were encamped, and the Barbarians, coming up to the village, attempted to skirmish with them, the Greeks had greatly the advantage ;
for they found a great difference2 between sally­ ing from their own ground to repulse the enemy, and fighting with a pursuing enemy on their march.
34.
When evening approached, it became time for the enemy to retire;
for the Barbarians never encamped at a less distance from the Greeks than sixty stadia, fearing lest the Greeks should attack them in the night.
35. For in the night a Persian army is difficult to manage;
as their horses are tied, and for the most part fastened by the feet, that they may not run away if they should be untied ;
and if any sudden at­ tack takes place, the Persian has' to put the housings4 on his horse, and to bridle him, and then, when lie has put on his armour, to mount;
but all these things are troublesome by night and in the midst of an alarm.
On this account they encamped at a distance from the Greeks.
36.
As soon as the Greeks saw that they intended to retire, and were passing the order for doing so, proclamation was made among the Greeks, in the hearing of the enemy, that they were to collect their baggage;
when the Barbarians, for some time, delayed their march ;
but, when it grew late, they went off, for they did not think it expedient to march and ar­ rive at their camp I in the night.
37. When the Greeks ob­ served them evidently moving away, they themselves also decamped2 and began to march, and accomplished as much as sixty stadia.
There was thus so great a distance between the armies, that the enemy did not appear on the following day or on the third ;
but on the fourth, the Barbarians, having gone forward in the night, occupied an elevated position on the right, on the route by which the Greeks were to pass ;
the brow of a mountain, beneath which was the descent into the plain.
38. As soon as Cheirisophus saw that this eminence was pre-occupied, he sent for Xenophon from the rear, and ordered him to bring his peltasts and come to the front.
39. Xenophon however did not bring the peltasts, (for he saw Tissaphernes, and all his force, in full view,) but, riding up alone, asked, " Why do you call me?"
Cheirisophus replied, " You may see ;
for the eminence above the descent has been pre-occupied against us, and it is impossible to pass, unless we cut off those who are on it.
But why did you not bring the peltasts?"
40. Xenophon replied that he did not think it right to leave the rear unguarded when the enemy were in sight.
"But it is high time," he continued, " to consider how some of us may dislodge those men from the hill."
41. Xeno­ phon now noticed that the summit of the mountain3 was above their own army, and that there was a way from it to the hill where the enemy were, and exclaimed, “ It is best for as, Cheirisophus, to hasten as quickly as possible to the summit, for if we gain this, those who arc above our road will be unable to maintain their ground.
But do you, if you please, remain with the army ;
I have a desire to go forward ;
or, if you prefer it, proceed on to the mountain, and I will stay here." 42. " I leave you," replied Cheirisophus, “ to choose which of the two you please."
Xenophon, observing that he was the younger, decided on advancing, but requested Cheirisophus to send with him a detachment from the front, as it was too great a distance to bring one from the rear.
43. Cheirisophus then sent with him the peltasts from the front;
and he took those that were in the middle of the square.
Cheirisophus also ordered the three hundred that he had with him at the head of the square, consisting of picked men, to follow Xenophon.
44. The party then marched forward with all possible speed.
But the enemy on the heights, when they perceived that the Greeks were directing their course towards the sum­ mit, hurried forward also themselves to contend for the pos­ session of the summit.
45. There was then great shouting from the Grecian army, cheering their men, and great shout­ ing also from the troops of Tissaphernes, cheering on theirs.
46. Xenophon, riding along on horseback, encouraged his party, saying, “ Consider, soldiers, that you are now contend­ ing for Greece ;
that after a brief struggle now, we shall march the rest of the way without fighting, to join our chil­ dren and our wives.”
47. Soterides, a Sicyonian, cried out, “ We are not upon an equality, Xenophon ;
for you are car­ ried on a horse, while I have hard work to carry my shield."
48. Xenophon, on hearing this remark, leaped from his horse, pushed Soterides from the ranks, took from him his shield, and marched on with it as fast as he was able.
he happened however to have on his horseman's corslet, so that he was distressed.
Yet he continued to exhort the men in front to lead on gently, and those behind, who followed with difficulty, to come up.
49. But the rest of the soldiers beat and threw stones at Soterides, and reviled him, till they obliged him to re­ sume his shield and march in his place.
Xenophon, remount­ ing, led the way, as long as it was passable for his horse, on horseback, but when it became impassable, he left his horse behind, and hastened forward on foot.
Thus they got the start of the enemy, and arrived first at the summit.
The Greeks arrive at a point where the Carducliian mountains overhang the river, and, as they are still harassed by the enemy, the generals hold a consultation, and determine to march across the mountains.
1.
THE Barbarians, in consequence, turned their backs and fled every one as he could, and the Greeks took possession of the top of the hill.
Tissaphernes and Ariæus turned aside, and went off in another direction.
Cheirisophus and his forces, go­ ing down into the plain, encamped in a village abounding with acceptable supplies;
and there were also in this plain many other villages stored with excellent provisions, lying along the river Tigris.
2. When it was evening, the enemy suddenly showed themselves in the plain, and cut off some of the Greeks who were dispersed over the ground foraging ;
for several herds of cattle had been intercepted as they were being transported to the other side of the river.
3. Here Tissaphernes and his party attempted to set fire to the vil­ lages, and some of the Greeks were much disheartened, being apprehensive that, if they should burn them, they would have no place whence to procure supplies.
4.
Cheirisophus and his men now returned from giving succour;
1 and Xenophon, when he came down, riding past the ranks, as the Greeks, coming in from affording aid, met him, said, 5.
"You see, Greeks, that the enemy admit that the country is now ours, for whereas they stipulated, when they made the truce, that we should not burn the king's coun­ try, they now burn it themselves, as being no longer theirs.
But wherever they leave supplies for themselves, thither also they shall see us direct our march.
6. I think, however, Cheirisophus;
” continued he,“that we ought to resist these burn­ er?, as if in defence of our own territory.” “ I," replied Chei­ risophus, “amof a different opinion ;
rather let us burn also," said he, "and thus they will the sooner cease."7. When they returned to their quarters,!
the soldiers busied themselves about their provisions, but the general and captains held a council.
There was now much perplex­ ity ;
for on one side of them were exceeding high mountains, and on the other a river of such depth, that, when they sounded it.
their spears did not rise above the water.
8. While they were in doubt how to act, a Rhodian came to them, and said, " I am willing to convey you across, 0 Greeks, by four thousand heavy-armed men at a time, if you will furnish me with what I require for the purpose, and give me a talent as a remuneration."
9. Being asked what he should require, he replied, " I shall want two thousand hides made into bags;
and I see here many sheep, goats, oxen, and asses, the hides of which, being blown out,2 would easily furnish the means of crossing.
to.
I shall want also the ropes which you use for the baggage-cattle ;
joining, with these, the bags to one another, steadying each bag by attaching stones to it, let­ ting the stones down like anchors into the water, extending the bags across the stream, and securing them to both banks, I will then lay wood upon them, and strew earth over the wood.
11. That you will not sink, you will at once see;
for each skin will prevent two men from sinking, and the wood and earth will keep them from slipping off."
12. The generals, on hearing this proposal, thought the invention ingenious, but the execution of it impossible, for there were numerous cavalry on the other side to hinder their passage, who, at the commencement, would not have allowed the first that made the attempt to effect their purposes.
13.
The next day they retreated back towards Babylon, to some unburnt villages, having first set fire to those which they abandoned ;
so that the enemy did not come up to them, but watched them, and seemed to be wondering which way the Greeks would turn themselves, and what they had in their mind.
14. The rest of the soldiers then turned their thoughts to getting supplies;
but the generals and captains held ano­ ther council, and, bringing together the prisoners, questioned them as to the whole country around, what each part was.
15. They said that the parts toward the south were on the road towards Babylon and Media, through which the Greeks had come ;
that the road towards the east led to Susa and Eebatana, where the king was said to pass the summer and spring ;
that the one across' the river, towards the west, led to Lydia and Ionia;
and that the other over the mountains, towards the north, led to the Carduchi.
16. This people, they said, lived among the mountains, were very warlike, and did not obey the king;
that on one occasion, a royal army of a hundred and twenty thousand men had penetrated into their country, whence, from the impracticability of the ground, not one of them returned ;
but that, whenever they made a treaty with the satrap of the plain, some of them had intercourse with the Carduchi, and some of the Carduchi with them.
17. The generals, having heard these statements, kept apart by themselves those who said that they knew the road in each direction, not letting it be known which way they intended to go.
It appeared necessary to the generals, however, to make their way over the mountains into the country of the Cardu­ chi ;
for the prisoners said that after passing through this they would come to Armenia, a large and rich country, of which Orontes was governor, whence it would be easy for them to go whichever way they pleased.
18.
With reference to this proceeding, they made a sacri­ fice, in order that, when it should seem time, they might com­ mence their march;
for they were afraid that the passage over the mountains might be pre-occupied by the enemy ;
and they gave orders, that when the soldiers had supped, they should all pack up their baggage and go to rest, and follow their leaders whenever the signal should be given.
The Greeks enter the territory of the Carduchi, where they suffer greatly from the wind and cold, as well as from the Barbarians, who harass them with frequent attacks on their march.
1.
WHAT occurred in the expedition up the country to the time of the battle, and what took place after the battle during the truce which the king and the Greeks that went up with Cyrus concluded, and what hostilities were committed against the Greeks after the king and Tissaphernes had violated the truce, and while the Persian army was pursuing them, have been related in the preceding part of the narrative.
2.
When they had arrived at a spot where the Tigris was quite impassable from its depth and width, and where there was no passage along its banks, as the Carduchian mountains hung steep over the stream, it appeared to the generals that they must march over those mountains, 3. for they had heard from the prisoners that " if they could but cross the Carduchian mountains, they would be able to ford, if they wished, the sources of the Tigris in Armenia, or, if they declined doing so, to make a circuit round them."
The sources of the Eu phrates, too, they said were not far from those of the Tigris, and such is the truth.
14. Their entrance upon the territory of the Carduchi they made in the following manner, endeavouring at once to escape observation, and to anticipate the enemy in getting pos­ session of the heights.
5. When it was about the last watch, and enough of the night was left to allow them to cross the plain under cover of the darkness, they arose at a given sig­ nal, and, marching onwards, reached the hills by break of day.
6. Here Cheirisophus took the lead of the army, having with him both his own men and all the light-armed;
while Xenophon brought up the rear with the heavy-armed troops, having not a single light-armed soldier;
for there seemed to be no danger that any of the enemy would attack them in the rear as they were marching up the mountains.
Cheirisophus indeed mounted the summit before any of the enemy perceived him ;
he then led slowly forward ;
7.
and each portion of the army, as it passed the summit in succession, followed him to the villages which lay in the windings and recesses of the moun­ tains.l
8. The Carduchi, in consequence, quitting their dwell­ ings, and taking with them their wives and children, fled to the hills.
There was plenty of provisions left for the Greeks to take ;
and the houses were furnished with great numbers of brazen utensils, none of which the Greeks took away.
Nor did they pursue the people, being inclined to spare them, if perchance the Carduchi, since they were enemies to the king, might consent to allow them to pass through their country as that of friends ;
9.
the provisions, however, as many as fell in their way, they carried off;
for it was a matter of necessity to do so.
But as for the Carduchi themselves, they would neither listen when they called, nor did they give any other sign of friendly feeling.
10.
But when the rear of the Greeks was descending from the hills into the villages, being now overtaken by darkness, (for, as the way was narrow, their ascent of the heights, and descent to the villages, had lasted the entire day,) some of the Carduchi, collecting together, attacked the hindmost, and killed and wounded some of them with stones and arrows.
They were but few;
for the Greek troops had come on them unawares;
11.
but had they assembled in greater numbers, a great part of the army would have been in danger of being destroyed.
For this night, accordingly, they took up their abode in the villages ;
and the Carduchi lighted a number of fires around them on the hills, and observed the positions of one another.
2 12. As soon as it was day, the generals and captains of the Greeks, meeting together, resolved, when they should march, to reserve only such of the baggage-cattle as were most necessary and most able, abandoning the rest, and to dismiss all the slaves in the army that had been recently captured ;
13.
for the cattle and the slaves, being numerous, rendered their progress slow, and the number of men in charge of them were unable to take part in any encounter;
and be­ sides, when the men were so numerous, it was necessary to procure and carry with them a double quantity of provisions.
This resolution being passed, they made proclamation that the troops should act accordingly.
14. When they had breakfasted, and were on the march, the generals, taking their stand in a narrow part of the way, took from the soldiers whatever of the things mentioned they found had not been left behind;
and the men submitted to this, unless any of them, smitten with desire of a handsome boy or woman, conveyed them past sceretly.
1
Thus they proceeded during this day, sometimes having to fight a little, and some­ times resting themselves.
15. On the next day a great storm arose ;
but they were obliged to pursue their march, for they had not a sufficient supply of provisions.
Cheirisophus con­ tinued to lead, and Xenophon had charge of the rear.
16. The enemy pressed steadily upon them, and, where the passes were narrow, came close up, and used their lows and their slings;
so that the Greeks, sometimes pursuing and some­ times retreating, were compelled to march but slowly;
and Xenophon, when the enemy attacked them violently, had fre­ quently to pass the word for a halt.
17. Cheirisophus, at other times, when the order was passed, halted, but on one occasion he did not halt, but hurried on rapidly, and passed the word to follow;
so that it was manifest that there was some­ thing extraordinary;
but there was no time to go forward and ascertain the cause of the haste;
and the march of the rear-guard became like a flight, 18.
On this occasion a brave soldier, Cleonymus a Lacedæmonian, met his death, being shot with an arrow in the side through his shield and corslet ;
2 and also Basias, an Arcadian, shot right through the head.
19.
When they arrived at the place of encampment, Xeno- phon immediately proceeded, just as he was, to Cheirisophus, and blamed him for not haying halted, as the men had been compelled to flee and fight at the same time.
"
Two honour­ able and brave soldiers," said he, “ have now been killed, and we have been unable either to carry off their bodies or bury them."
20. To this remark Cheirisophus answered, " Cast your eyes upon those mountains, and observe how impassable they all are.
The only road which you see is steep;
and close upon it you may perceive a great multitude of men, who, having occupied the pass, keep guard at it.
21. For these reasons I hastened on, and therefore did not wait for you, to try if I could get the start of the enemy before the pass was seized ;
and the guides whom we have say that there is no other road.”
22. Xenophon rejoined, “ I have two prisoners;
for when the enemy molested us, we placed an ambush, which enabled us to recover breath, and killed some of them;
and we were also anxious to take some alive for this very purpose, that we might use them, as being well acquainted with the country, for guides."23.
Immediately after, bringing forward the two men, they inquired of them separately whether they knew of any other road than that which was open to their view.
The one denied that he knew of any other, though many threats were held out to him ;
and as he would give no useful information, he was put to death in sight of the other.
24. The survivor said that the other had denied any knowledge of a road, because he had a daughter there married to somebody, but stated that he him­ self would lead them by a road that might be passed even by beasts of burden.
25. Being then asked if there was any spot in it difficult to be passed, he replied that there was one height, and that unless a party secured it before-hand, it would be im­ possible for them to pass.
26. Upon this it was thought proper to call together the captains, both of the peltasts and of the heavy-armed men,1 and to acquaint them with the prospect of affairs, and ask whether any of them was willing to prove himself a man of valour, and engage to go on this service as a volunteer.
27. Of the heavy-armed, Aristonymus of Methy­ drium, and Agasias of Stymphalus, both Arcadians, offered themselves ;
and Callimachus of Parrhasia, also an Arcadian, disputed the honour with them, and said that he himself was eager to go, taking with him volunteers from the whole army ;
“ for I am sure,” said lie, “ that many of the yonng men will follow if I take the lead."
28. They then asked if any of the officers of the light-armed troops were willing to join in the attempt;
and Aristeas of Chios presented himself, a man who had often proved himself of great value to the army for similar services.
One of the prisoners is forced to guide them to an eminence, from which they dislodge the Carduchi.
But they are still harassed, and the rear suffers severely.
1.
IT was now afternoon, and the generals1 desired the party to take some refreshment and set forward.
Hav­ ing bound the guide, they put him into their hands, and arranged with them, that, if they should gain the summit, they should keep guard at that post during the night, and give a signal by trumpet at break of day, and that those on the height should then charge the enemy in possession of the apparent egress,2 and those below should issue forth and come n a body to their assistance as soon as they were able.
2.
When they had made this arrangement, the party set ut, being in number about two thousand;
and there was heavy rain at the time.
Xenophon, taking the rear-guard, led them towards the apparent egress, in order that the enemy might turn their attention in that direction, and that those who were going round might as much as possible escape no­ tice.
3. But when the rear-guard came to a ravine, which they had to pass to gain the ascent, the Barbarians then rolled down masses of rock,3 each big enough to load a waggon, with other stones greater and smaller, which, striking in their de­ scent against the rocks, were hurled abroad in all directions ;
1 and it was utterly impossible even to approach the pass.
4. Some of the captains, whan they could not succeed in this part, made attempts in another, and continued their efforts till darkness came on.
When they thought that they might retire unobserved, they went to get their supper ;
for the rear-guard had been dinnerless that day.
The enemy, how­ ever, being evidently in fear, continued to roll down stones through the whole of the night, as it was easy to conjecture from the noise.
5. Those, meanwhile, who had the guide, taking a circuitous route, surprised a guard of the enemy sitting round a fire, and, having killed some of them, and put the rest to flight, remained on the spot, with the notion that they were in possession of the summit.
6. But in possession of it they were not;
for there was a small hill above them, round which lay the narrow pass, at which the guard had been posted.
However, there was a way from thence to that party of the enemy who were stationed at the open egress.
7. Here they remained during the night.
As soon as day began to dawn, they advanced in regular order, and with silence, against the enemy;
and as there was a mist, they came close upon them before they were per­ ceived.
But when they caught sight of one another, the trumpet sounded on the side of the Greeks, who, raising the shout of battle, rushed upon the enemy.
The Barbarians did not stand their charge, but quitted the pass and fled ;
only a few of them were killed, for they were active in moving off.
8. At the same time the party of Cheirisophus, hearing the sound of the trumpet, marched immediately up the plain track;
while others of the officers proceeded by untrodden paths, where each happened to be, and, climbing up as well as they could, drew up one another with their spears;
9. and these were the first to join those who had secured the position.
Xenophon, with the half.
of the rear-guard, went up by the same way as those who had the guide ;
for it was the most practicable for the baggage-cattle ;
the other half he ordered to come up behind the cattle.
to.
In their way they came to a hill overhanging the road, which was occupied by the enemy, whom they must either dislodge or be separated from the rest of the Greeks.
The men themselves, indeed, might have gone the same way as the rest of the army, but the baggage-cattle could ascend by no other route than this.
11. Encouraging one another, therefore, they made an attack upon the hill in files,1 not on every side, but leaving a way of escape for the enemy, if they should be inclined to flee.
12. For a while, as they were making their way as each best could, the Bar­ barians shot arrows and threw stones at them, but did not receive them in close encounter, and at last abandoned the place entirely.
The Greeks had no sooner passed the hill, than they caught sight of another before them occupied also by the enemy.
Upon this hill it was resolved likewise to make an assault.
13. But Xenophon, apprehending that, if he left the hill which they had taken unguarded, the enemy, recovering it, might attack the baggage-cattle as they were passing, (for the train of baggage-cattle reached a great distance, as they were marching along a narrow path,) left upon the hill the captains Cephisodorus the son of Cephisophon, an Athenian, Amphi­ crates the son of Amphidemus, an Athenian, and Archagoras, an exile from Argos, while he himself, with the others, directed his march upon the second hill, which they also captured in similar manner.
14. However, there was still a third hill left for them to take, which was by far the steepest of the whole;
this was an eminence that overhung the post where the guard was surprised in the night by the volunteers.
15. Bit as the Greeks came up, the Barbarians deserted the hill without attempting any defence, so that all were surprised, and sus­ pected that they had left their position from fear of being sur­ rounded and besieged in it.
But the truth was, that having ob- served from the eminence what had passed behind, they all went off with the intention of attacking the rear.
16. Xenophon, with the youngest of his men, ascended to the top, and ordered the rest to march on slowly, so that the companies in the rear might join them ;
and he directed them, after proceeding some distance, to halt under arms, on a level piece of ground.
17. At this juncture Aristagoras the Argive came fleeing from the enemy, and said that the Greeks were driven from the first hill, and that Cephisodorus, and Amphi­ erates, and all the rest, who had not leaped from the rock, and joined the rear-guard, had been killed.
18. The Barbarians, after this success, appeared upon an eminence opposite the third hill, and Xenophon began to treat with them, through an interpreter, about making a twice, and called upon them to give up the dead.
19. They replied, that they would give them up on condition that he would not burn their villages.
To this Xenophon agreed.
But while the rest of the army was passing on, and these were discussing the terms of a truce, all the Barbarians from that part of the country had flocked together.
Here the enemy made a stand;
20.
and when Xenophon's party began to descend the hill, to join the others where the heavy-armed troops were drawn up,1 they came forward in great numbers and with loud shouts.
When they had reached the top of the hill from which Xenophon was descending, they rolled down stones, and broke the leg of one man ;
and Xenophon's shield-bearer deserted him, carrying off his shield, 21.
but Eurylochus, an Arcadian from Lusia,2 a heavy-armed soldier, ran to his support, and went on holding his shield before them both ;
and the rest went to join those who were already drawn up.
22. The entire Grecian force was now together, and took up their quarters in a number of good houses, and in the midst of abundance of provisions.
Wine was so abundant, that they kept it in excavations under ground, which were plastered over.
3 23. Xenophon and Cheirisophus now made an agreement with the enemy, that on receiving the dead bodies they should give up the guide;
and they performed all funeral rites for the deceased, as far as they could, according to what is usually done at the interment of brave men.
24. The next day they proceeded without a guide;
and the enemy, sometimes by skirmishing, and sometimes, where there was a narrow pass, by pre-occupying it, endeavoured to obstruct their progress.
25. Whenever therefore they im­ peded the front, Xenophon, ascending the hills from the rear, endeavoured to break through the opposition made in that quarter, trying always to reach higher ground than the ob­ structing enemy;
26.
and when they assailed the rear, Chei­ risophus, quitting his place, and striving also to get above the enemy, removed the obstruction that was offered to the passage of that part of the army.
Thus they relieved and supported each other with effect.
27. Sometimes, too, when the Greeks had ascended eminences, the Barbarians gave them great annoyance in their descent;
and, as they were nimble, they could escape, though they had but a very short start of us ;
1 for they were encumbered with no other weapons than bows and slings.
28. As archers they were very expert, and had bows nearly three cubits long, and arrows above two cubits ;
and they drew the string, whenever they discharged their arrows, advancing the left foot 2 against the lower ex­ tremity of the bow.
Their arrows penetrated through shields and corslets;
and the Greeks, taking them up, made use of them as javelins, fixing thongs to them.

In these parts tho Cretans were of the greatest service.
Stratocles, a Cretan had the command of them.
The Greeks arrive at the river Centrites, which divides the Carduchi from Armenia.
They see the Persians drawn up on the opposite bank, while the Carduchi threaten their rear.
They are encouraged by a dream of Xenophon's to try a ford, and effect a safe passage across the stream.
I. THIS day the Greeks abode in the villages above the plain near the river Centrites, the breadth of which is about two hundred feet, and which forms the boundary between Armenia and the territory of the Carduchi.
Here they took some rest, being glad to see a piece of level country.
The river is distant from the mountains of the Carduchi about six or seven stadia.
2. It was with great satisfaction that they stayed here, as they had a sufficiency of provisions, and were frequently reflecting on the difficulties that were past, for, during seven days that they had been marching among the Carduchi, they had been constantly fighting, and had suffered more evils than all those which they had endured from the King and Tissaphernes.
1
Having escaped from such hard­ ships, they gladly took repose.
3. At day-break, however, they perceived on the other side of the river a body of cavalry, in complete armour, ready to prevent them from crossing, and on the high banks above the cavalry, another of foot prepared to hinder them from enter­ ing Armenia.
4. These were Armenians, Mardians, and Chaldæans, mercenary troops of Orontes and Artuchas.2
The Chaldæans were said to be a free people, and warlike;
for arms they had long shields and spears.
5. The high banks on which these forces were drawn up, were three or four hundred feet from the river;
and the only road that was visible was one that led upward, apparently a work of art.
Here the Greeks endeavoured to cross, 6. but as, on making trial, the water rose above their breasts, and the bed of the river was rough with large and slippery stones, and as it was impossible for them to carry their arms in the water, or, if they attempted to do so, the river swept them away, (while, if any of them took their arms on their heads, they became exposed to the arrows and other missiles of the enemy,) they in consequence retreated, and encamped at the side of the river.
7.
They now perceived the Carduchi assembled in great numbers under arms on the spot where they themselves had been on the previous night.
Hence great despondency was felt by the Greeks, as they knew the difficulty of passing the river, and saw the Carduchi ready to attack them if they attempted to cross.
8. This day, therefore, and the following night, they remained where they were in great perplexity.
Xenophon however had a dream;
he thought that he was bound in fetters, but that they fell off him of their own accord, so that he was set at liberty, and walked securely1 whithersoever he pleased.
9. When the morning approached, he went to Cheirisophus, told him that he had hopes that all would be well, and related to him his dream.
Cheirisophus was much pleased, and, as soon as it was day, all the general:
who were present offered sacrifice, and the victims were favourable at the very first.
As soon as they left the place of sacrifice, the generals and captains gave directions to the troops to take their breakfast.
10.
While Xenophon was at breakfast, two young men came running up to him, for every one knew that it was allowable to approach him whether breakfasting or supping, and to wake him and speak to him even when asleep, if they had anything to tell of affairs relating to the war.
11. The youths informed him that they had been gathering sticks for their fire, and had chanced to see, on the opposite side of the river, among the rocks that reached down to the stream itself, an old man, a woman, and some girls, depositing in a cavern­ ous rock what appeared to be bags of clothes ;
12.
that when they saw this, they thought it would be safe to cross, as the ground at that point was inaccessible to the enemy's horse ;
that having taken off their clothes, and taken their daggers in their hands, they went over undressed, in expectation of hav­ ing to swim, but that, as they went on, they reached the other side before they were wet to the middle, and, having thus forded the stream, and taken the clothes, they came back again.
13. Xenophon immediately therefore made a libation, and ordered the young men to join in it,2 and to pray to the gods who had sent the dream and pointed out the ford, to complete what was wanting to their success.
After the liba­ tion, he at once conducted the youths to Cheirisophus, and to him they gave the same account.
Cheirisophus, on hear­ ing it, made a libation also.
14. When the libation was over, they gave orders to the soldiers to get their baggage ready ;
while they themselves.
calling the rest of the generals together, consulted with them how they might cross the river to the best advantage, and how they might defeat the enemy in front, and suffer no damage from those in the rear.
15. It was then resolved that Cheiri­ sophus should take the lead, and cross over with half of the army, that the other half should stay behind with Xenophon, and that the baggage-cattle and camp-followers should go over between the two.
16. When these matters were fairly arranged, they began to move, the young men acting as guides, and keeping the river on the left, the distance to the ford being about four stadia.
17. As they proceeded, the lines of the enemy's cavalry advanced abreast of them on the opposite bank;
and when they came to the ford, and the mar­ gin of the river, they halted, laying down their arms;
and then Cheirisophus himself, placing a chaplet upon his head,1 and laying aside his outer garments, took up his arms and commanded the rest to follow his example, directing the cap­ tains to lead their troops in files,2 some on his left hand, and some on his right.
is.
The augurs at the same time sacri­ ficed victims over the river;
3 while the enemy plied their bows and slings, but did not reach the Greeks.
19. As the sacrifices appeared favourable, all the soldiers sung the pæan and raised a shout, and all the women (for there were a number of the men's mistresses in the army) joined in the cry.
20.
Cheirisophus and his men then entered the stream ;
and Xenophon, taking the most active of the rear-guard, marched at full speed back to the ford1 opposite the outlet into the mountains of Armenia, making a feint that he meant to cross the river there, and thus cut off the cavalry that were on the bank ;
21.
when the enemy, seeing Cheirisophus and his men crossing over with ease, and Xenophon and his party hurry­ ing back, were afraid of being intercepted, and fled with pre­ cipitation to gain the outlet that led up from the river, and as soon as they came to that passage, they directed their course up into the mountains.
22. Lycius, who had the command of the troop of horse, and AEschines, who commanded the band of peltasts attending on Cheirisophus, seeing the enemy retreat­ ing with so much haste, set off in pursuit of them ;
and the rest of the soldiers called to each other not to stay behind,2 but to go along with them up the mountains.
23. But Cheiri­ sophus, when he had crossed the river, did not follow the cavalry, but made his way up the high banks that reached down to the river, to attack that portion of the enemy that were on the more elevated ground.
3
This party on the heights, however, seeing their cavalry take to flight, aban­ doned their commanding position above the stream.
24. Xenophon, when lie saw that all was going well on the other side, returned with all possible speed to join that part of the army which was crossing over;
for the Carduchi were evidently descending into the plain, with the view of falling upon the rear.
25. Cheirisophus was now in possession of the heights, and Lycius, who, with his small party, had pro­ ceeded in pursuit of the enemy, had captured some of their baggage that they had left behind, and amongst it some rich garments and drinking-eups.
26. The baggage and camp- followers of the Greeks were still in the act of crossing;
and Xenophon, turning towards the Carduchi, halted under arms over against them, and ordered the captains to form each his own company into divisions of five and twenty men, bringing round each division in line towards the left;
and he directed both the captains, and the officers of the divisions of five and twenty, to advance facing the Carduchi, and the rearmost to halt facing the river.
27.
The Carduchi, when they observed that the rear-guard of the camp-followers was diminished in number, and that they seemed now indeed to be but few, advanced at a quicker pace, singing at the same time certain songs.
Cheirisophus, when he saw that all was safe on his own side, sent the pel­ tasts, and the slingers and archers, to Xenophon, desiring them to do whatsoever he should direct.
28. Xenophon, see­ ing them beginning to cross, sent a messenger to desire that they should remain by the river where they were, without crossing, and that, when his own party should begin to cross, they should come forward into the water on each side opposite to him, the javelin-men holding their weapons by the thong,1 and the archers with their arrows on the string, as if with the intention of crossing over, but not to advance far into the river.
29. His own men lie ordered, as soon as a sling should reach them and a shield should ring,2 to raise the pæan and rush towards the enemy;
and he directed that when the enemy should take to flight, and the trumpeter should sound the signal of attack3 from the river, the rear should wheel to the right and take the lead, and that they should then all run forward as fast as possible, and cross over at the part where each happened to be stationed, so as not to impede one another;
telling them that he would be the best man who should first reach the opposite side.
30. The Carduchi, see- . ing that those who were left were but few, (for many even of those who had been ordered to stay had gone away, some to take care of the cattle, some of their baggage, and others of their mistresses,) began, in consequence, to press forward boldly, and to use their slings and bows.
31. The Greeks then sang the pæan, and rushed upon them at full speed;
and the Barbarians did not stand their charge;
for though they were well enough equipped for a sudden onset and retreat upon the mountains, they were by no means sufficiently armed to receive an enemy hand to hand.
At this juncture the trumpeter sounded, 32.
when the enemy fled still faster, and the Greeks, turning in the opposite direction, made their way over the river with all possible speed.
33. Some of the enemy, perceiving this movement, ran back to the river, and wounded a few of our men with their arrows ;
but the greater number of them, even when the Greeks were on the other side, were observed to continue their flight.
34. The troops, meanwhile, that came to meet Xenophon, being carried away by their courage, and advancing too far, repassed the river in the rear of Xenophon’s men ;
and some of these also were wounded.
The Greeks enter Armenia, pass the sources of the Tigris, and arrive at the Teleboas.
They make a treaty with Tiribazus, the governor of the pro­ vince,and discover his insincerity.
1.
WHEN they had crossed, and had ranged themselves in order about noon, they proceeded through the country of At,­ menia, consisting wholly of plains and gently sloping hills, a distance of not less than five parasangs ;
for there were no villages near the river, in consequence of the hostilities with the Carduchi.
2. The village, however, at which they at length arrived, was of considerable size, and contained a palace for the satrap ;
1 upon most of the houses there were towers, and provisions were in great plenty.
3.
Hence they proceeded, two days' journey, a distance of ten parasangs, until they passed round the sources of the river Tigris.
From hence they advanced, three days' journey, fif- teen parasangs, to the river Teleboas, a stream not large, in­ deed, but of much beauty ;
and there were many villages on its banks, 4. This part of the country was called Western Armenia.
The deputy-governor of it was Tiribazus, who was an intimate friend of the king ;
and no one else, when he was present, assisted the king to mount his horse.
5. He now rode up with a body of cavalry, and sending forward an inter­ preter, said that he wished to speak with the commanders.
The generals thought proper to hear what he had to say, and, advancing within hearing, asked what he wanted.
6. He re­ plied, that he wished to make a treaty with them, on the con­ ditions that he himself should not hurt the Greeks, and that the Greeks should not burn the houses, but should be at liberty to take such provisions as they required.
This pro­ posal was agreeable to the generals, and they concluded a treaty upon these terms.
7.
Hence they proceeded, three days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, through a plain;
and Tiribazus followed them with his troops, keeping at the distance of about ten stadia.
They then came to a palace,3 with several villages around it stored with abundance of provisions.
8. While they were encamped, there fell a great quantity of snow4 in the night;
and in the morning it was thought advisable that the companies and officers should take up their quarters in the neighbouring villages;
for they perceived no enemy, and it appeared to be safe on account of the quantity of the snow.
1
9. Here they fouud all kinds of excellent provisions, cattle, corn, old wines of great fragrance, dried grapes, and vegetables of all kinds.
Some of the soldiers, however, who had strolled away from the camp, brought word that they had caught sight of an army, and that many fires had been visible during the night.
to.
The generals thought it unsafe, therefore, for the troops to quarter apart, and resolved to bring the whole army together again.
They accordingly assembled, for it seemed to be clear­ ing up.2 11. But as they were passing the night here, there fell a vast quantity of snow, so that it covered both the arms and the men as they lay on the ground.
The snow cramped the baggage-cattle, and they were very reluctant to rise ;
for, as they lay, the snow that had fallen upon them served to keep them warm, when it had not dropped off.
12. But when Xenophon was hardy enough to rise without his outer gar­ ment, and to cleave wood, some one else then rose, and, taking the wood from him, cleft it himself.
Soon after, the rest got up, and lighted fires and anointed themselves ;
13.
for abund­ ance of ointment was found there, made of hog's-lard, sesa­ mum,3 bitter almonds, and turpentine, which they used in­ stead of oil.
Of the same materials also an odoriferous unguent was found.
14.
After this it was resolved to quarter again throughout the villages, under shelter;
and the soldiers went off with great shouting and delight to the cottages and provisions.
Those who had set fire to the houses, when they quitted them before, paid the penalty of having to encamp uncomfortably in the open air.
13. Hence they despatched in the night De­ mocrates of Temenos, giving him a detachment of men, to the hills where the stragglers said that they had seen the fires ;
they selected him because he was thought on several former occasions to have brought exact information concerning such matters reporting what was, just as it appeared, and what was not, a:
not existing.
16. Having gone, he said that he saw no fires, but he brought with him a captive that he had taken, having a Persian bow and quiver, and a short battle-axe, such as the Amazons have.
17. Being asked of what country he was, he said that he was a Persian, and that he was going from the army of Tiribazus to get provisions.
They then asked him how large the army was, and for what purpose it was assem­ bled.
IS.
He said that Tiribazus had his own troops, and some mercenaries from the Chalybes and Taochians;
and that he was prepared to attack the Greeks in their passage over the mountains, at a narrow defile through which lay their only road.
19.
The generals, on hearing this, resolved to collect the army, and, leaving a guard, with Sophænetus the Stymphalian as commander over those who stayed behind, proceeded to march without delay, taking the man that had been captured for their guide.
20. After they had passed the mountains, the peltasts, who went before the rest, and were the first to discover the enemy's camp, did not wait for the heavy-armed men, but ran forward with a shout to attack it.
21. The Barbarians, hearing the noise, did not stand their ground, but fled;
some of them however were killed, and about twenty horses taken, as was also the tent of Tiribazus, and in it some couches with silver feet, and drinking-cups, and some prison­ ers, who said that they were bakers and cup-bearers.
22. When the officers of the heavy-armed troops heard what had taken place, they resolved upon marching back as fast as pos­ sible to their own camp, lest any attempt should be made on those who had been left there.
Calling in the men immedi­ ately, therefore, by sound of trumpet, they returned to the camp the same day.
The Greeks march through an uninhabited tract of country, suffering great­ ly from cold winds, snow, and want of provisions.
At length they reach some well-stored villages, where they rest seven days.
I. THE next day it was thought necessary to march away as fast as possible, before the enemy's force should be re­ assembled, and get possession of the pass.
Collecting their baggage at once, therefore, they set forward through a deep snow, taking with them several guides ;
and, having the same day passed the height on which Tiribazus had intended to at­ tack them, they encamped.
2. Hence they proceeded three days'journey through a desert tract of country, a distance of fifteen parasangs,1 to the river Euphrates, and passed it with­ out being wet higher than the middle.
The sources of the river were said not to be far off.
3. From hence they ad­ vanced three days' march, through much snow and a level plain, a distance of fifteen parasangs;
the third day's march was extremely troublesome, as the north-wind blew full in their faces, completely parching up everything and benumb­ ing the men.
4. One of the augurs, in consequence, advised that they should sacrifice to the wind ;
and a sacrifice was accordingly offered;
when the vehemence of the wind ap­ peared to every one manifestly to abate.
The depth of the snow was a fathom ;
2 so that many of the baggage-cattle and slaves perished, with about thirty of the soldiers.
5. They continued to burn fires through the whole night, for there was plenty of wood at the place of encampment.
But those who came up late could get no wood;
those therefore who had arrived before, and had kindled fires, would not admit the late comers to the fire unless they gave them a share of the corn or other provisions that they had brought.
6. Thus they shared with each other what they respectively had.
In the places where the fires were made, as the snow melted, there were formed large pits that reached down to the ground;
and here there was accordingly opportunity to measure the depth of the snow.
7.
From hence they marched through snow the whole of the following day, and many of the men contracted the buli­ mia.
1 Xenophon, who commanded in the rear, finding in his way such of the men as had fallen down with it, knew not what disease it was.
8. But as one of those acquainted with it, told him that they were evidently affected with bulimia, and that they would get up if they had something to eat, he went round among the baggage, and, wherever he saw any­ thing eatable, he gave it out, and sent such as were able to run to distribute it among those diseased, who, as soon as they had eaten, rose up and continued their march.
9. As they proceeded, Cheirisophus came, just as it grew dark, to a vil­ lage, and found, at a spring in front of the rampart, some women and girls belonging to the place fetching water.
10. The women asked them who they were;
and the interpreter answered, in the Persian language, that they were people going from the king to the satrap.
They replied that he was not there, but about a parasang off.
However, as it was late, they went with the water-carriers within the rampart, to the head man of the village;
11.
and here Cheirisophus, and as many of the troops as could come up, encamped;
but of the rest, such as were unable to get to the end of the journey, spent the night on the way without food or fire ;
and some of the soldiers lost their lives on that occasion.
12. Some of the.
enemy too, who had collected themselves into a body, pursued our rear, and seized any of the baggage-cattle that were un­ able to proceed, fighting with one another for the possession of them.
Such of the soldiers, also, as had lost their sight from the effects of the snow, or had had their toes mortified by the cold, were left behind.
13. It was found to be a relief to the eyes against the snow, if the soldiers kept something black before them on the march, and to the feet, if they kept con­ stantly in motion, and allowed themselves no rest, and if they took off their shoes in the night;
14.
but as to such as slept with their shoes on, the straps worked into their feet, and the soles were frozen about them;
for when their old shoes had failed them, shoes of raw hides had been made by the men themselves from the newly-skinned oxen.
15. From such unavoidable sufferings, some of the soldiers were left behind, who, seeing a piece of ground of a black appearance, from the snow having disappeared there, conjectured that it must have melted;
and it had in fact melted in the spot from the effect of a fountain, which was sending up vapour in a woody hol­ low close at hand.
Turning aside thither, they sat down and refused to proceed farther.
16. Xenophon, who was with the rear-guard, as soon as lie heard this, tried to prevail on them by every art and means not to be left behind, telling them, at the same time, that the enemy were collected, and pursuing them in great numbers.
At last he grew angry ;
and they told him to kill them, as they were quite unable to go forward.
17. He then thought it the best course to strike a terror, if possible, into the enemy that were behind, lest they should fall upon the exhausted soldiers.
It was now dark, and the enemy were advancing with a great noise, quarrelling about the booty that they had taken;
is.
when such of the rear- guard as were not disabled, started up, and rushed towards them, while the tired men, shouting as loud as they could, clashed their spears against their shields.
The enemy, struck with alarm, threw themselves among the snow into the hollow, and no one cf them afterwards made themselves heard from any quarter.
19.
Xenophon, and those with him, telling the sick men that a party should come to their relief next day, proceeded on their march, but before they had gone four stadia, they found other soldiers resting by the way in the snow, and covered up with it, no guard being stationed over them.
They roused them up, but they said that the hoad of the army was not moving forward.
20. Xenophon, going past them, and send­ ing on some of the ablest of the peltasts, ordered them to ascer­ tain what it was that hindered their progress.
They brought word that the whole army was in that manner taking rest.
21. Xenophon and his men, therefore, stationing such a guard as they could, took up their quarters there without fire or supper.
When it was near day, he sent the youngest of his men to the sick, telling them to rouse them and oblige them to proceed.
22. At this juncture Cheirisophus sent some of his people from the villages to see how the rear were faring.
The young men were rejoiced to see them, and gave them the sick to conduct to the camp, while they themselves went for ward, and, before they had gone twenty stadia, found them­ selves at the village in which Cheirisophus was quartered.
23. When they came together, it was thought safe enough to lodge the troops up and down in the villages.
Cheirisophus accordingly remained where he was, and the other officers, appropriating by lot the several villages that they had in sight, went to their respective quarters with their men.
24.
Here Polycrates, an Athenian captain, requested leave of absence, and, taking with him the most active of his men, and hastening to the village which Xenophon had been allot­ ted, surprised all the villagers, and their head man, in their houses, together with seventeen I colts that were bred as a tribute for the king, and the head man’s daughter, who had been but nine days married ;
her husband was gone out to hunt hares, and was not found in any of the villages.
25. Their houses were under ground, the entrance like the mouth of a well, but spacious below ;
there were passages dug into them for the cattle, but the people descended by ladders.
In the houses were goats, sheep, cows, and fowls, with their young ;
all the cattle were kept on fodder within the walls.
1 26. There was also wheat, barley, leguminous vegetables, and harley-wine,1 in large bowls ;
the grains of barley floated in it even with the brims of the vessels, and reeds also lay in it, some larger and some smaller, without joints ;
27.
and these, when any one was thirsty, he was to take in his mouth, and suck.
2
The liquor was very strong, unless one mixed water with it, and a very pleasant drink to those accustomed to it.
28.
Xenophon made the chief man of his village sup with him, and told him to be of good courage, assuring him that he should not be deprived of his children, and that they would not go away without filling his house with provisions in re­ turn for what they took, if he would but prove himself the author of some service to the army till they should reach another tribe.
29. This lie promised, and, to show his good- will, pointed out where some wine3 was buried.
This night, therefore, the soldiers rested in their several quarters in the midst of great abundance, setting a guard over the chief, and keeping his children at the same time under their eye.
30. The following day Xenophon took the head man and went with him to Cheirisophus, and wherever he passed by a village, he turned aside to visit those who were quarter­ ed in it, and found them in all parts feasting and enjoying themselves;
nor would they anywhere let them go till they had set refreshments before them ;
31.
and they placed every­ where upon the same table lamb, kid, pork, veal, and fowl, with plenty of bread both of wheat and barley.
32. When­ ever any person, to pay a compliment, wished to drink to another, he took him to the large bowl, where he had to stoop down and drink, sucking like an ox.
The chief they allowed to take whatever he pleased, but he accepted nothing from them;
where he found any of his relatives, however, he took them with him.
33.
When they came to Cheirisophus, they found his men also feasting in their quarters,1 crowned with wreaths made of hay, and Armenian boys, in their Barbarian dresses, wait­ ing upon them, to whom they made signs what they were to do as if they had been deaf and dumb.
34. When Cheiriso­ phus and Xenophon had saluted one another, they both asked the chief man, through the interpreter who spoke the Persian language, what country it was.
He replied that it was Ar­ menia.
They then asked him for whom the horses were bred ;
and he said that they were a tribute for the king, and added that the neighbouring country was that of the Chalybes, and told them in what direction the road lay.
35. Xenophon then went away, conducting the chief back to his family, giving him the horse that he had taken, which was rather old, to fat­ ten and offer in sacrifice, (for he had heard that it had been consecrated to the sun,) being afraid, indeed, that it might die, as it had been injured by the journey.
He then took some of the young horses, and gave one of them to each of the other generals and captains.
36. The horses in this country were smaller than those of Persia, but far more spirited.
The chief instructed the men to tie little bags round the feet of the horses, and other cattle, when they drove them through the snow, for without such bags they sunk up to their bellies.
The Greeks leave the villages under conduct of a guide, who, on beIng struck by Cheirisophus, deserts them, After wandering through the country for seven days, they arrive at the Phasis, and in two days more at some mountains occupied by the Phasiani, Taochi, and Chalybes, whom, by skilful manoeuvring, they dislodge.
1.
WHEN the eighth day was come, Xenophon committed the guide to Cheirisophus.
He left the chiefs all the members of his family, except his son, a youth just coming to mature age ;
him he gave in charge to Episthenes of Amphipolis, in order that If the father should conduct them properly, he might return home with him.
At the same time they carried to his house as many provisions as they could, and then broke up their camp, and resumed their march.
2. The chief con­ ducted them through the snow, walking at liberty.
When lie came to the end of the third day's march, Cheirisophus was angry at him for not guiding them to some villages.
He said that there were none in that part of the country.
Cheiriso­ phus then struck him, but did not confine him ;
3.
and in con­ sequence he ran off in the night, leaving his son behind him.
This affair, the ill-treatment and neglect of the guide, was the only cause of dissension between Cheirisophus and Xenophon during the march.
Episthenes conceived an affec­ tion for the youth, and, taking him home, found him extremely attached to him.
4.
After this occurrence they proceeded seven days'journey, five parasangs each day, till they came to the river Phasis,1 the breadth of which is a plethrum.
5. Hence they advanced two days' journey, ten parasangs;
when, on the pass that led over the mountains into the plain, the Chalybes, Taochi, and Phasians were drawn up to oppose their progress.
6. Chei­ risophus, seeing these enemies in possession of the height, came to a halt, at the distance of about thirty stadia, that lie might not approach them while leading the army in a column.
He accordingly ordered the other officers to bring up their companies, that the whole force might be formed in line.
27.
When the rear-guard was come up, he called together the generals and captains, and spoke to them as follows:
" The enemy, as you see, are in possession of the pass over the mountains ;
and it is proper for us to consider how we may encounter them to the best advantage.
8. It is my opinion, therefore, that we should direct the troops to get their dinner, and that we ourselves should hold a council, in the mean time, whether it is advisable to cross the mountain to-day or to-morrow."
9. “ It seems best to me," exclaimed Cleanor, “ to march at once, as soon as we have dined and resumed our arms, against the enemy;
for if we waste the present day in inaction, the enemy who are now looking down upon us will grow bolder, and it is likely that, as their confidence is increased, others will join them in greater numbers."10.
After him Xenophon said, "I am of opinion, that if it is necessary to fight, we ought to make our arrangements so as to fight with the greatest advantage ;
but that, if we propose to pass the mountains as easily as possible, we ought to consider how we may incur the fewest wounds and lose the fewest men.
11. The range of hills, as far as we see, extends more than sixty stadia in length;
but the people nowhere seem to be watching us except along the line of road ;
and it is therefore better, I think, to endeavour to try to seize unobserved some part of the unguarded range, and to get possession of it, if we can, beforehand, than to attack a strong post and men prepared to resist us.
12. For it is far less difficult to march up a steep ascent without fighting than along a level road with enemies on each side;
and, in the night, if men are not obliged to fight, they can see better what is before them than by day if engaged with enemies;
while a rough road is easier to the feet to those who are marching without molestation than a smooth one to those who are pelted on the head with missiles.
13. Nor do I think it at all impracticable for us to steal a way for ourselves, as we can march by night, so as not to be seen, and can keep at such a distance from the enemy as to allow no possibility of being heard.
We seem likely, too, in my opinion, if we make a pretended attack on this point, to find the rest of the range still less guarded;
for the enemy will so much the more probably stay where they are.
14. But why should I speak doubtfully about stealing ?
For I hear that you Lacedæmonians, 0 Cheirisophus, such of you at least as are of the better class,1 practise stealing from your boyhood, and it is not a disgrace, but an honour, to steal whatever the law does not forbid ;
15.
while, in order that you may steal with the utmost dexterity, and strive to escape discovery, it is appointed by law that, if you are caught stealing, you are scourged.
It is now high time for you, therefore, to give proof of your education, and to take care that we may not receive many stripes."
16. “ But I hear that you Athenians also," rejoined Cheirisophus, "are very clever at stealing the public money, though great danger threatens him that steals it;
and that your best men steal it most, if indeed your best men are thought worthy to be your magistrates;
so that it is time for you likewise to give proof of your education."
17. " I am then ready," exclaimed Xenophon, "to march with the rear-guard, as soon as we have supped, to take possession of the hills.
I have guides too;
for our light-armed men captured some of the marauders following us by lying in ambush;
and from them I learn that the mountains are not impassable, but are grazed over by goats and oxen, so that if we once gain possession of any part of the range, there will be tracks also for our baggage-cattle.
18. I expect also that the enemy will no longer keep their ground, when they see us upon a level with them on the heights, for they will not now come down to be upon a level with us."
19. Cheirisophus then naid, "But why should you go, and leave the charge of the roar?
Rather send others, unless some volunteers present themselves."
20. Upon this Aristonymus of Methydria came forward with his heavy-armed men, and Aristeas of Chios and Xicomachus of Œta1 with their light-armed ;
and they made an arrange­ ment, that as soon as they should reach the top, they should light a number of fires.
21. Having settled these points, they went to dinner;
and after dinner Cheirisophus led forward the whole army ten stadia towards the enemy, that he might appear to be fully resolved to march against them on that quarter.
22. When they had taken their supper, and night came on, those appointed for the service went forward and got posses­ sion of the hills;
the other troops rested where they were.
The enemy, when they saw the heights occupied, kept watch and burned a number of fires all night.
23. As soon as it was day, Cheirisophus, after having offered sacrifice, marched forward along the road;
while those who had gained the heights advanced by the ridge.
24. Most of the enemy, meanwhile, stayed at the pass, but a part went to meet the troops coming along the heights.
But before the main bodies came together, those on the ridge closed with one another, and the Greeks had the advantage, and put the enemy to flight.
25. At the same time the Grecian peltasts ran up from the plain to attack the enemy drawn up to receive them, and Cheirisophus followed at a quick pace with the heavy- armed men.
26. The enemy at the pass, however, when they saw those above defeated, took to flight.
Not many of them were killed, but a great number of shields were taken, which the Greeks, by hacking them with their swords, rendered useless.
27. As soon as they had gained the ascent, and had sacrificed and erected a trophy, they went down into the plain before them, and arrived at a number of villages stored with abundance of excellent provisions.
The Greeks, entering the country of the Taochi, storm a fort, capturing a great number of cattle, on which they subsist while traversing the region of the Chalybes.
They cross the Harpasus, and, marching through the territory of the Scythini, arrive at a town called Gymnias, whence they are conducted to Mount Thechus, from the top of which they see the Euxine.1.
FROM hence they marched five days' journey, thirty parasangs, to the country of the Taochi, where provisions began to fail them ;
for the Taochi inhabited strong fastnesses, in which they had laid up all their supplies.
2. Having at length, however, arrived at one place which had no city or houses attached to it, but in which men and women and a great number of cattle were assembled, Cheirisophus, as soon as he came before it, made it the object of an attack i and when the first division that assailed it began to be tired, another succeeded, and then another;
for it was not possible for them to surround it in a body, as there was a river about it.
3. When Xenophon came up with his rear-guard, peltasts, and heavy-armed men, Cheirisophus exclaimed, “ You come seasonably, for we must take this place, as there are no pro­ visions for the army, unless we take it."4. They then deliberated together, and Xenophon asking what hindered them from taking the place, Cheirisophus replied, “ The only approach to it is the one which you see;
but when any of our men attempt to pass along it, the enemy roll down stones over yonder impending rock, and whoever is struck, is treated as you behold ;
” and he pointed, at the same moment, to some of the men who had had their legs and ribs broken.
5. " But if they expend all their stones," re­ joined Xenophon, " is there anything else to prevent us from advancing ?
For we see, in front of us, only a few men, and but two or three of them armed.
6. The space, too, through which we have to pass under exposure to the stones, is, as you see, only about a hundred and fifty feet in length;
and of this about a hundred feet is covered with large pine trees in groups, against which if the men place themselves, what would they suffer either from the flying stones or the rolling ones?
The remaining part of the space is not above fifty feet, over which, when the stones cease, we must pass at a. running pace."
7. “But,” said Cheirisophus, "the instant we offer to go to the part covered with trees, the stones fly in great numbers." “ That," cried Xenophon, “ would be the very thing we want, for thus they will exhaust their stones the sooner.
Let us then advance, if we can, to the point whence we shall have but a short way to run, and from which we may, if we please, easily retreat.
"8. Cheirisophus and Xenophon, with Callimachus of Par­ rhasia, one of the captains, who had that day the lead of all the other captains of the rear-guard, then went forward, all the rest of the captains remaining out of danger.
Next, about seventy of the men advanced under the trees, not in a body, but one by one, each sheltering himself as he could.
9. Aga­ sias of Stymphalus, and Aristonymus of Methydria, who were also captains of the rear-guard, with some others, were at the same time standing behind, without the trees for it was not safe for more than one company to stand under them.
10. Callimachus then adopted the following stratagem:
he raIl forward two or three paces from the tree under which he was sheltered, and when the stones began to be hurled, hastily drew back;
and at each of his sallies more than ten cart­ loads of stones were spent.
11. Agasias, observing what Cal-. limachus was doing, and that the eyes of the whole army were upon him, and fearing that he himself might not be the first to enter the place, began to advance alone, (neither call­ ing to Aristonymus who was next him, nor to Eurylochus of Lusia, both of whom were his intimate friends, nor to any other person,) and passed by all the rest.
12. Callimachus, seeing him rushing by, caught hold of the rim of his shield, and at that moment Aristonymus of Methydria ran past them both, and after him Eurylochus of Lusia, for all these sought distinction for valour, and were rivals to one another;
and thus, in mutual emulation, they got possession of the place, for when they had once rushed in, not a stone was hurled from above.
13. But a dreadful spectacle was then to be seen;
for the women, flinging their children over the precipice, threw them­ selves after them;
and the men followed their example.
AEneas of Stymphalus, a captain, seeing one of them, who had on a rich garment, running to throw himself over, caught hold of it with intent to stop him.
14. But the man dragged him forward, and they both went rolling down the rocks together, and were killed.
Thus very few prisoners were taken, but a great number of oxen, asses, and sheep.
15. Hence they advanced, seven days' journey, a distance of fifty parasangs, through the country of the Chalybes.
These were the most warlike people of all that they passed through, and came to close combat with them.
They had linen cuirasses, reaching down to the groin, and, instead of skirts,' thick cords twisted.
16. They had also greaves and helmets, and at their girdles a short faulchion, as large as a Spartan crooked dagger, with which they cut the throats of all whom they could master, and then, cutting off their heads, carried them away with them.
They sang and danced when the enemy were likely to see them.
They carried also a spear of about fifteen cubits in length, having one spiked 17.
They stayed in their villages till the Greeks had passed by, when they pursued and perpetually harassed them.
They bad their dwellings in strong places, in which they had also laid up their provisions, so that the Greeks could get nothing from that country, but lived upon the cattle which they taken from the Taochi.
18.
The Greeks next arrived at the river Harpasus, the breadth of which was four plethra.
Hence they proceeded through the territory of the Scythini, four days' journey, making twenty parasangs, over a level tract, until they came to some villages, in which they halted three days, and collect­ ed provisions.
19. From this place they advanced four days' journey, twenty parasangs, to a large, rich, and populous city, called Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent the Greeks a guide, to conduct them through a region at war with his own people.
20. The guide, when he came, said that he would take them in live days to a place whence they should see the sea;
if not, he would consent to be put to death.
When, as he proceeded, he entered the country of their enemies, he exhorted them to burn and lay waste the lands ;
whence it was evident that he had come for this very purpose, and not from any good will to the Greeks.
21. On the fifth day they came to the mountain;
1 and the name of it was Theches.
When the men who were in the front had mounted the height, and looked down upon the sea, a great shout proceeded from them;
22.
and Xenophon and the rear-guard, on hearing it, thought that some new enemies were assailing the front, for in the rear, too, the people from the country that they had burnt were following them, and the rear-guard, by placing an am­ buscade, had killed some, and taken others prisoners, and had captured about twenty shields made of raw ox-hides with the hair on.
23. But as the noise still increased, and drew nearer, and as those who came up from time to time kept running at full speed to join those who were continually shouting, the cries becoming louder as the men became more numerous, it appeared to Xenophon that it must be something of very great moment.
24. Mounting his horse, therefore, and taking with him Lyeius and the cavalry, he hastened forward to give aid, when presently they heard the soldiers shouting, “The sea, the sea !" and cheering on one another.
They then all began to run, the rear-guard as well as the rest, and the baggage- cattle and horses were put to their speed;
25.
and when they had all arrived at the top, the men embraced one another, and their generals and captains, with tears in their eyes.
Sud­ denly, whoever it was that suggested it, the soldiers brought stones, and raised a large mound, 26.
on which they laid a number of raw ox-hides,1 staves, and shields taken from the enemy.
The shields the guide himself hacked in pieces,2 and exhorted the rest to do the same.
27. Soon after, the Greeks sent away the guide, giving him presents from the common stock, a horse, a silver cup, a Persian robe, and ten darics ;
3 but he showed most desire for the rings on their fingers, and obtained many of them from the soldiers.
Having then pointed out to them a village where they might take up their quarters, and the road by which they were to proceed to the Macrones, when the evening came on he departed, pur­ suing his way during the night.
The Greeks proceed unmolested through the country of the Macrones, and enter Colchis.
Putting to flight the Colchians who obstructed their pass­ age, they arrive at Trebisond, a Greek city, where they perform whatever vows they had made, and celebrate games.
1.
HENCE the Greeks advanced three days’journey, a dis­ tance of ten parasangs, through the country of the Macrones.
On the first day they came to a river which divides the terri­ tories of the Macrones from those of the Scythini.
2. On their right they had an eminence extremely difficult of access, and on their left another river,1 into which the boundary river, which they had to cross, empties itself.
This stream was thickly edged with trees, not indeed large, but growing closely together.
These the Greeks, as soon as they came to the spot, cut down,2 being in haste to get out of the country as soon as possible.
3. The Macrones, however, equipped with wicker shields, and spears, and hair tunics, were drawn up on the opposite side of the crossing-place;
they were ani­ mating one another, and throwing stones into the river.
3
They did not hit our men, or cause them any inconvenience.
4.
At this juncture one of the peltasts came up to Xeno­ phon, saying that he had been a slave at Athens, and adding that he knew the language of these men. " I think, indeed," said lie, " that this is my country, and, if there is nothing to prevent, I should wish to speak to the people.”
5. " There is nothing to prevent," replied Xenophon ;
" so speak to them, and first ascertain what people they are."
When he asked them, they said that they were the Macrones.
" Inquire, then," said Xenophon, “why they are drawn up to oppose us, and wish to be our enemies."
6. They replied, “Because you come against our country."
The generals then told him to acquaint them that we were not come with any wish to do them injury, but that we were returning to Greece after hav­ ing been engaged in war with the king, and that we were desirous to reach the sea.
7. They asked if the Greeks would give pledges to this effect;
and the Greeks replied that they were willing both to give and receive them.
The Macrones accordingly presented the Greeks with a Barbarian lance, and the Greeks gave them a Grecian one;
for they said that such were their usual pledges.
Both parties called the gods to witness.
8. After these mutual assurances, the Macrones immediate­ ly assisted them in cutting away the trees, and made a passage for them, as if to bring them over, mingling freely among the Greeks ;
they also gave such facilities as they could for buying provisions, and conducted them through their country for three days, until they brought them to the confines of the Colchians.
9. Here was a range of hills,' high, but accessible, and upon them the Colchians were drawn up in array.
The Greeks, at first, drew up against them in a line,2 with the intention of marching up the hill in this disposition ;
but afterwards the generals thought proper to assemble and deliberate how they might engage with the best effect.
10. Xenophon then said it appeared to him that they ought to relinquish the arrange­ ment in line, and to dispose the troops in columns;
3 "for a line," pursued he, “will be broken at once, as we shall find the hills in some parts impassable, though in others easy of access;
and this disruption will immediately produce despond­ ency in the men, when, after being ranged in a regular line, they find it dispersed.
11. Again, if we advance drawn upverymany deep, the enemy will stretch beyond us on both sides, and will employ the parts that outreach us in any way they may think proper;
and if we advance only a few deep, it would not be at all surprising if our line be broken through by showers of missiles and men falling upon us in large bodies.
If this happen in any part, it will be ill for the whole extent of the line.
12. I think, then, that having formed our companies in columns, we should keep them so far apart from each other as that the last companies on each side may be beyond tho enemy's wings.
Thus our extreme companies will both outflank the line of the enemy, and, as we march in file, the bravest of our men will close with the enemy first, and wher­ ever the ascent is easiest, there each division will direct its course.
13. Nor will it be easy for the enemy to penetrate into the intervening spaces, when there are companies on each side, nor will it be easy to break through a column as it ad­ vances ;
while, if any one of the companies be hard pressed, the neighbouring one will support it;
and if but one of the companies can by any path attain the summit, the enemy will no longer stand their ground."
14. This plan was approved, and they threw the companies into columns.
Xenophon, tiding along from the right wing to the left, said, " Soldiers, the enemy whom you see before you, are now the only ob­ stacle to hinder us from being where we have long been eager to be.
These, if we can, we must eat up alive."
1is.
When the men were all in their places, and they had formed the companies into columns, there were about eighty companies of heavy-armed men, and each company consisted of about eighty men.
The peltasts and archers they divided into three bodies, each about six hundred men, one of which they placed beyond the left wing, another beyond the right, and the third in the centre.
16. The generals then desired the soldiers to make their vows2 to the gods ;
and having made them, and sung the paean, they moved forward.
Cheirisophus and Xenophon, and the peltasts that they had with them, who were beyond the enemy's flanks, pushed on ;
17.
and the ene­ my, observing their motions, and hurrying forward to receive them, were drawn off, some to the right and others to the left, and left a great void in the centre of their line ;
18.
when the peltasts in the Arcadian division, whom Æschines the Acar­ nanian commanded, seeing them separate, ran forward in all haste, thinking that they were taking to flight;
and these were the first that reached the summit.
The Arcadian heavy- armed troop, of which Cleaner the Orchomenian was captain, followed them.
19. But the enemy, when once the Greeks began to run, no longer stood their ground, but went off in flight, some one way and some another.
Having passed the summit, the Greeks encamped in a num­ ber of villages containing abundance of provisions.
20. As to other things here, there was nothing at which they were surprised;
but the number of bee-hives was extraordinary and all the soldiers that ate of the combs, lost their senses, vomited, and were affected with purging, and none of them were able to stand upright;
such as had eaten only a little were like men greatly intoxicated, and such as had eaten much were like mad-men, and some like persons at the point of death.
21. They lay upon the ground, in consequence, in great num­ bers, as if there had been a defeat;
and there was general de- jection.
The next day no one of them was found dead ;
and they recovered their senses about the same hour that they had lost them on the preceding day;
and on the third and fourth days they got up as if after having taken physic.
122.
From hence they proceeded two days' march, seven parasangs, and arrived at Trebisond, a Greek city, of large population, on the Euxine Sea ;
a colony of Sinope, but lying in the territory of the Colchians.
Here they stayed about thirty days, encamping in the villages of the Colchians, 23.
whence they made excursions and plundered the country of Colchis.
The people of Trebisond provided a market for the Greeks in the camp, and entertained them in the city;
and made them presents of oxen, barley-meal, and wine.
24. They negotiated with them also on behalf of the neighbour­ ing Colchians, those especially who dwelt in the plain, and from them too were brought presents of oxen.
25.
Soon after, they prepared to perform the sacrifice which they had vowed.
Oxen enough had been brought them to offer to Jupiter the Preserver, and to Hercules, for their safe conduct, and whatever they had vowed to the other gods.
They also celebrated gymnastic games upon the hill where they were encamped, and chose Dracontius a Spartan, (who had become an exile from his country when quite a boy, for having involuntarily killed a child by striking him with a dagger,) to prepare the course and preside at the contests.
26.
When the sacrifice was ended, they gave the hides2 to Dracontius.
and desired him to conduct them to the place where he had made the course.
Dracontius, pointing to the place where they were standing, said, “This hill is an excellent place for running, in whatever direction the men may wish." "
But how will they be able," said they, " to wrestle on ground so rough and bushy?” " He that falls," said he, " will suffer the more."
27. Boys, most of them from among the prisoners, contended in the short course,' and in the long course1 above sixty Cretans ran;
while others were matched in wrestling, boxing, and the pancratium.
It was a fine sight;
for many entered the lists, and as their friends were spectators, thero was great emulation.
28. Horses also ran ;
and they had to gallop down the steep, and, turning round in the sea, to come up again to the altar.
2
In the descent, many rolled down ;
but in the ascent, against the exceedingly steep ground, the horses could scarcely get up at a walking pace.
There was consequently great shouting, and laughter, and cheering from the people.
Cheirisophus goes to Anaxibius, the Spartan admiral, to obtain ships for the Greeks.
Xenophon, meanwhile, attends to other matters, and devises another plan for procuring vessels, if Cheirisophus should fail in his mis­ sion, and causing the roads to be repaired, in ease the army should be obliged to proceed by land.
Treachery of Dexippus. and efficient exertions of Polycrates.1.
WHAT the Greeks did in their march up the country with Cyrus, and what they underwent in their journey to the Euxine Sea;
how they arrived at the Greek city of Trebi­ send, and how they offered the sacrifices which they had vowed to offer for their safety as soon as they should reach a friendly country, has been related in the preceding part of this narrative.
2.
They now assembled to hold a council concerning the remainder of their journey;
and Antileon, a native of Thurii, stood up first, and spoke thus:
" For my part, my friends, I am now quite exhausted with packing up my baggage, walk­ ing, running, carrying my arms, marching in order, mount­ ing guard, and fighting, and should wish, since we have come to the sea, to rest from such toils, and to sail the remainder of the way ;
and to arrive at Greece, like Ulysses, stretched out asleep ”1 3.
The soldiers, on hearing these remarks, cried out that he spoke well;
and then another, and afterwards all the rest, expressed the same feelings.
Cheirisophus then rose, and spoke as follows:
4. “Anaxibius2 is a friend of mine, and is now admiral.
If, therefore, you will commission me to go to him, I have no doubt that I shall return with galleys and transport-vessels to carry you.
And as you wish to sail, stay here till I come back ;
for I shall come very soon."
When the soldiers heard this offer, they were delighted, and voted that he should set sail with all speed.
5.
After him Xenophon stood up, and spoke to the follow­ ing effect:
“Cheirisophus is going to fetch ships, and we shall remain here ;
and I will now mention what I think it proper for us to do during our stay.
6. In the first place, we must get provisions from the enemy's country;
for the market here is not abundant enough to supply us, nor have we, except some few, a sufficiency of means with which to purchase.
But the country around us is inhabited by ene­ mies;
and there is danger, therefore, that many of you may' be killed, if you go out in quest of provisions heedlessly and unguardedly.
7. It seems to me, then, that we ought to seek provisions in foraging-parties,1 and not to wander about at random ;
so that you may preserve your lives;
and that we, the officers, should have the regulation of these proceedings."
These suggestions were approved.
8. “Attend also," he said, "to the following hints.
Some of you will go out for plunder.
I think it will be better, then, for any one that intends to go out, to give us notice, and say in what direc­ tion, that we may know the number of those who go and of those who stay at home, and may take part in their projects if it should be necessary ;
and that, if it should be requisite to send succour to any party, we may know whither to send it;
while if any of the less experienced make an attempt in any quarter, we may aid his views by trying to learn the strength of the enemy against whom he is going."
To this proposal assent was likewise given.
9. “Consider this too," added he ;
“the enemy have leisure to rob us;
they meditate attacks upon us, and with justice, for we are in possession of their property.
They are also posted above us ;
and it appears to me, therefore, that sentinels should be placed round the camp, so that, if, being divided into parties, we keep guard and watch by turns, the enemy will be less in a condition to catch us by surprise.
10. Take this also into consideration.
If we knew for certain that Cheirisophus would come with a suffi­ cient number of ships to transport us, there would be no occa­ sion for what I am going to say;
but, since this is uncertain, I think that we ought, in the mean time, to endeavour to pro­ vide ourselves with ships from hence;
for, if he comes with ships, and vessels are ready here, we shall sail in a greater number of ships ;
and, if he brings none, we shall make use of what we have procured here.
11. I observe vessels frequently sailing past;
and if therefore we should ask the people of Trebisond for ships of war, and bring them in to the shore and keep them under guard, unshipping their rudders till a sum­ cient number be collected to carry us, we shall possibly not fail of securing such conveyance as we require."
This sugges­ tion was also approved.
12. " Reflect also," said he, "whether it will not be proper to support the mariners whom we bring into harbour from the common stock, as long as they may stay on our account, and to make an agreement with them about the passage-money, that by benefiting us they may also be benefited themselves."
To this they also agreed.
13. " It appears to me further," he continued, “that if our efforts are not successful to procure vessels in sufficient number,' we should enjoin the towns lying on the sea to repair the roads, which, we hear, are scarcely passable;
for they will obey such an injunction both from fear and from a wish to be rid of us.”
14. At this point of his speech they cried out that there must be no travelling by land.
Xenophon, seeing their want of consideration, did not put that particular to the vote.
But he afterwards prevailed on the towns to mend the roads of their own accord, telling them that if the roads were made passable, they would so much the sooner be delivered from the Greeks.
15. They received also a fifty-oared galley from the people of Trebisond, over which they placed Dexippus, a Spartan, one of the periœci ;
2 who, neglecting to get vessels together, went off with the galley clear out of the Euxine.
He however met with a just retribu­ tion some time after;
for being in Thrace, at the court of Seuthes, and engaging in some intrigue, he was killed by Nicander a Lacedæmonian.
16. They received too a thirty- oared galley, over which Polycrates an Athenian was ap­ pointed, who brought all the vessels that he could get to the shore before the camp ;
and the Greeks, taking out their cargoes, if they had any, set guards over them, that they might be secure, and reserved the vessels for their passage.
17.
While these affairs were going on, the soldiers were making excursions for plunder;
and some succeeded and others not;
but Cleænetus, as he was leading out his own troop and another against some strong place, was killed, as well as several of those that were with him.
To augment their stock of provisions, Xenophon undertakes a foraging ex­ pedition against the Drilæ, who lay waste their fields, and shut themselve up in their chief fort, which the Greeks take and burn to the ground.
1.
WHEN it was no longer possible for the foragers to get provisions, so as to return the same day to the camp, Xeno­ phon, taking some of the people of Trebisond as guides, led out half the army against the Drilæ, leaving the other half to guard the camp ;
for the Colchians, having been driven from their homes, were collected in large numbers, and had posted themselves on the heights.
2. The guides from Trebisond, however, did not conduct them to places whence it was easy to get provisions, for the inhabitants of those parts were their friends, but led them with great eagerness into the territories of the Drilæ, from whom they had received injuries, into mountainous and difficult tracts, and against the most warlike of all the people on the shores of the Pontus Euxinus.3.
When the Greeks had got up into their country, the Drilæ retreated, having first set fire to such of their places as seemed easy to be taken ;
and there was nothing for the Greeks to capture but swine, or oxen, or any other cattle that had escaped the fire.
But there was one place that consti­ tuted their metropolis;
and to this they had all flocked.
Around it there was an extremely deep ravine, and the ways of access to the place were difficult.
4. However the peltasts, having outstripped the heavy-armed men by five or six stadia, crossed the ravine, and getting sight of a great deal of cattle and other booty, made an attack upon the place;
and many spear-men,' who had gone out for plunder, followed close upon them;
so that the number of those who crossed the ravine amounted to more than two thousand.
5. As they found themselves unable to take the place by assault, (for there was a broad trench round it, the earth from which had been thrown up as a rampart, and upon the rampart were palisades, and a number of wooden towers erected,) they attempted to retire, but the enemy pressed hard upon them;
6. and a,;
they could not effect a retreat, (for the descent from the place to the ravine would allow only one to pass at a time,) they sent for aid to Xenophon, who was at the head of the heavy-armed men.
7. The messenger said, that the place was stored with abundance of things;
"but," said he, " we are unable to take it, for it is strong;
nor is it easy for us to retreat, for the enemy sally forth and assail our rear, and the way from it is dif­ ficult.
"8. Xenophon, on hearing this account, brought up the heavy-armed to the ravine, and ordered them to halt there under arms, while he himself, crossing over with the captains, deliberated whether it would be better to bring off those that had already gone over, or to lead over the heavy-armed also, in the hope that the place might be taken;
9. for it seemed impossible to bring off the first party without the loss of many lives, and the captains were of opinion that they might take the place.
Xenophon accordingly yielded to their judgment, placing some reliance, at the same time, on the sacrifices;
for the augurs had signified that there would be an action, and that the result of the excursion would be favourable.
to.
He therefore despatched the captains to bring over the heavy- armed men, while he himself remained where he was, keeping back the peltasts, and allowing none of them to skirmish with the enemy.
11. When the heavy-armed troops came up, he ordered each of the captains to form his company in such a manner as he might think most advantageous for fighting;
for those captains, who were perpetually contending with one another in gallantry, were now standing close to each other.
12. They executed his orders ;
and he then directed all the peltasts to advance holding their javelins by the thong,1 as it would be necessary to hurl whenever he should give the signal, and the archers having their arrows resting on the string,1 as, whenever he gave the signal, they would have to shoot;
he ordered the skirmishers2 also to have their bags full of stones, and commissioned proper persons to see these orders executed.
13. When everything was ready, and the captains and lieutenants, and all those1 who thought themselves not inferior to these, were in their places, and had a full view of each other, (for the disposition of the troops, from the nature of the ground, was in the form of a crescent,) the heavy-armed men, 14.
after they had sung the paean and the trumpet had sounded, raised the war-cry to Mars, and ran forward, while the missiles, consisting of lances, arrows, balls from slings, and numbers of stones flung from the hand, were hurled among the enemy;
and some of the men, too, threw fire-brands at the place.
15. By reason, therefore, of the multitude of these missives, the enemy abandoned both the palisades and the lowers;
so that Agasias of Stymphalus and Philoxenus of Pellene, laying aside their armoury mounted the ramparts in their tunics only;
and then one drew up another, and others mounted by themselves, and the place, as it appeared, was taken.
16. The peltasts and light-armed men, accordingly, rushed in and laid hands on whatever they could find ;
while Xenophon, taking his stand at the gates, detained as many of the heavy-armed as he could outside of them, for other bodies of the enemy were showing themselves upon some strong posi­ tions among the hills.
17. After the lapse of a short interval of time, a cry arose within, and the men came fleeing out, some carrying what they had seized, and one or two perhaps wounded ;
and there was great crowding about the gates.
Those who rushed out, being questioned as to the cause, said that there was a citadel within, and a great number of the enemy, who sallied forth and fell upon our men who were in the place.
18. Xenophon then told Tolmides the crier to pro­ claim that whoever wished to get any plunder might go in ;
when many hastened to the entrance, and those who tried to push their way in got the better of those that were hurrying out, and shut up the enemy again within the citadel.
19. All the parts without the citadel were then ravaged, and the Greeks brought out the spoil;
while the heavy-armed men ranged themselves under arms, some round the palisading, and some along the way leading to the citadel.
20. Xenophon and the captains then deliberated whether it would be possible to take the citadel, for, in that case, a safe retreat would be secured ;
otherwise it seemed a difficult matter to retire ;
and it appeared to them, upon consideration, that the citadel was altogether impregnable.
21. They accordingly began to pre­ pare for a retreat;
each of the men pulled up the palisades that were nearest to him;
and the captains sent out of the place the useless hands,1 and those who were loaded with plunder, but retained those in whom they severally confided.
222.
When they commenced their retreat, numbers of the enemy sallied forth upon them from within, armed with light shields, spears, greaves, and Paphlagonian helmets,3 while others climbed upon the houses that were on each side of the road leading to the citadel, 23.
so that it was not safe to pursue them towards the gate leading thither, for they hurled down large pieces of timber from above;
and it was in con­ sequence dangerous either to remain or retreat;
and the night, which was coming on, increased their alarm.
24. But while they were thus engaged and in perplexity, some god gave them the means of saving themselves;
for one of the houses on the right suddenly burst out in flames, whoever it was that set fire to it, and when it fell in, the enemy fled from all the houses on the right;
25.
when Xenophon, having learned this expedient from fortune, gave orders to set fire to all the houses on the left, which were of wood, and soon in a blaze;
and the enemy accordingly fled from these houses also.
26. Those who were directly over against them,4 however, and those only, still continued to annoy them, and gave evident' signs of an intention to fall upon them in their egress and descent.
Xenophon in consequence ordered all who were out of reach of the missiles to bring wood into the space between them and the enemy;
and when a considerable quantity was collected, they set fire to it, setting fire at the same time to the houses close to the palisading, in order that the enemy's at- tention might be engaged about these proceedings.
27. Thus, by interposing fire between themselves and the enemy, they effected, though with difficulty, a retreat from the place.
The whole of the town, houses, towers, palisading, and every­ thing else except the citadel, was reduced to ashes.
28.
The next day the Greeks marched away, carrying with them the provisions that they had taken;
but as they had some fears with regard to the descent to Trebisond, (for it was steep and narrow,) they placed a pretended ambuscade.
29. A certain man, a Mysian by birth, and bearing that name,1 took ten Cretans with him and waited in a woody place, making it appear that he was endeavouring to conceal himself from the enemy;
while their shields, which were of brass, glittered from time to time through the bushes.
30. The enemy accordingly, observing these indications, were afraid as of a real ambuscade ;
and in the mean time the army effected its descent.
When it appeared to the Mysian that they were advanced far enough,3 he gave a signal for them to flee with all speed, and he himself, and those that were with him, started up and hurried off.
31. The others, the Cretans, quitting the road, (for they said4 that they were gained upon in the race,) threw themselves down among the wood into the bushy hollows, and got off safe;
32.
but the Mysian himself, pursuing his flight along the road, was heard to call out for aid, when some ran to his relief, and brought him off wounded.
The party who had rescued him then retreated step by step with their face towards the enemy, being exposed to their missiles, while some of the Cretans discharged their arrows in return.
Thus they all returned in safety to the camp.
Being unable, from want of provisions, to wait longer for Cheirisophus, the Greeks despatch the camp-followers and baggage by sea, and proceed themselves by land to Cerasus, where the whole army is reviewed.
They divide among themselves the money arising from the sale of the prison­ ers, the generals taking charge of the tenth part, which had been vowed to Apollo and Diana.
Description of Xenophon's residence, and of the temple of Diana, at Scillus.1.
As Cheirisophus did not return, and a sufficient number of vessels were not collected, and as there was no longer a possibility of getting supplies, it appeared that they must take their departure.
They accordingly put on board the sick persons, and those who were above forty years of age, with the women and children, and whatever baggage it was not necessary to retain, and appointed Philesius and Sophænetus, the eldest of the generals, to go in the vessels and take charge of them.
The rest of the army proceeded by land ;
for the road was now prepared.
2. Pursuing their march, they ar­ rived on the third day at Cerasus, a Greek city upon the coast in the country of Colchis, and a colony from Sinope.
3. Here they stayed ten days, and a review of the troops under arms was held, and their number taken ;
they were in all eight thousand six hundred.
These were saved out of about ten thousand ;
the rest had been cut off by the enemy and the snow, and perhaps two or three by sickness.
4.
Here also they distributed the money arising from the sale of the prisoners.
The tenth part, which they set aside for Apollo and Diana of Ephesus, the generals took among them, each a portion, to keep for those duties.
Neon of Asina received that which was intended for Cheirisophus.5.
Xenophon, after causing an offering to be made for Apollo, deposited it in the treasury of the Athenians at Delphi, inscribing on it his own name, and that of Proxenus, who was killed with Clearchus;
for he had been his guest- friend.
6. The portion designed for Diana of Ephesus he left with Megabyzus, the warden of that goddess's temple, when he returned1 with Agesilaus out of Asia on an expedi- tion to Bœotia, because he seemed likely to incur some peril, and enjoined him, if he escaped, to return the money to him, but, if he met with an ill fate, to make such an offering as he thought would please the goddess, and dedicate it to her.
7. Afterwards, when Xenophon was banished1 from his country, and was living at Scillus, a colony settled by the Lacedæmonians near Olympia, Megabyzus came to Olympia to see the games, and restored him the deposit.
Xenophon, on receiving it, purchased some land as an offering to the goddess where the god had directed him.
The river Selinus happen to run through the midst of it;
8. and another river named Selinus runs close by the temple of Diana at Ephesus;
and in both there are different kinds of fish, and shell-fish.
On the land near Scillus, too, there is hunting, of all such beasts as are taken in the chase.
9. He built also an altar and a temple with the consecrated money, and continued afterwards to make a sacrifice every year, always receiving a tenth of the produce of the seasons from the land;
and all the people of the town, as well as the men and women of the neighbour­ hood, took part in the festival;
while the goddess supplied those in tents there with barley-meal, bread, wine, sweetmeats.
and a share of the victims offered from the sacred pastures, and of those caught in hunting;
10.
for the sons of Xenophon, and those of the other inhabitants, always made a general hunt against the festival, and such of the men as were willing hunted with them ;
and there were caught, partly on the sacred lands, and partly on Mount Pholoe, boars, and antelopes, and deer.
11. This piece of ground lies on the road from Lacedæmon to Olympia, about twenty stadia from the temple of Jupiter at Olympia.
There are within the place groves and hills covered with trees, adapted for the breeding of swine, goats, oxen, and horses, so that the beasts of the persons coming to the festival are amply supplied with food.
12. Round the temple itself is planted a grove of cultivated trees, bearing whatever fruits are eatable in the different seasons.
The edifice is similar, as far as a small can be to a great one, to that at Ephesus;
and the statue is as like to that at Ephesus as a statue of cypress can be to one of gold.
13. A pillar stands near the temple, bearing this inscription :
THIS GROUND IS SACRED TO DIANA.
HE THAT POSSESSES AND REAPS THE FRUIT OF IT IS TO OFFER EVERY YEAR THE TENTH OF ITS PRODUCE, AND TO KEEP THE TEMPLE IN REPAIR FROM THE RESIDUE.
IF ANY ONE FAIL TO PERFORM THESE CONDITIONS.
THE GODDESS WILL TAKE NOTICE OF HIS NEGLECT.
The Greeks arrive at the country of the Mossynœci, who, relying on their strong-holds, endeavour to stop their progress.
But as they were divided into two parties, the Greeks defeat the one with the aid of the other, burn two fortresses and plunder the chief city.
Account of the barbarous manners of the Mossynœci.1.
FROM Cerasus those who had previously gone on board pursued their voyage by sea ;
the rest proceeded by land.
2. When they came to the confines of the Mossynœci, they sent to them Timesitheus, a native of Trapezus, and a guest- friend of the Mossynœci, to inquire whether they were to march through their country as one of friends or of enemies.
The Mossynœci replied that " they would allow them no pass­ age at all ;
” for they trusted to their strong-holds.
3. Time­ sitheus then acquainted the Greeks that the Mossynœci in the country beyond were at enmity with these;
and it was re­ solved accordingly to ask them whether they were willing to form an alliance with the Greeks.
Timesitheus, being de­ spatched for that purpose, returned with their chiefs.
4.
On their arrival, the chiefs of the Mossynœci and the generals of the Greeks held a conference, when Xenophon spoke, and Timesitheus interpreted.
5. “ We are desirous," said he, " 0 Mossynœci, to effect a safe passage to Greece by land, as we have no ships ;
but these people, who, as we hear, are your enemies, oppose our way.
6. It is in your power, therefore, if you think proper, to take us for your allies, and to avenge yourselves for whatever injury they have done you, and make them subject to you for the future.
1
7. But if you reject our application, consider whence you will again procure so efficient a power to support you."
8. To this the head chief of the Mossynœci answered that they were pleased with the proposal, and would consent to the alliance.
9. “ Well then," said Xenophon, " for what purpose will you want to make use of us, if we become your allies, and how far will you be able to assist us with regard to our passage through the country ?" to.
They replied, " We shall be able to make an irruption, from the farther side, into the country of those who are enemies to both you and us, and to send hither for you, both ships and men, who will be your auxiliaries, and guide you on your way."
11. Having given and received pledges on these terms, they departed.
The next day they returned with three hundred canoes,.
and three men in each, of whom two disembarked, and formed in line under arms, while the third remained on board.
12. The latter sailed off with the canoes, and those who were left behind, ranged themselves in the following manner.
They drew up in lines, of about a hundred men in each, like rows of dancers fronting one another, all bearing shields made of the hides of white oxen, with the hair on, shaped like an ivy­ leaf, and in their right hand a spear six cubits long, with a point at the upper end, and at the lower a round knob formed from the wood of the shaft.
13. They were clad in short tunics, that did not reach to their knees, of the thickness of a linen bag for bed-clothes,2 and had on their heads helmets made of leather like those of the Paphlagonians, with a plait of hair round the middle, nearly resembling a tiara ;
they had also battle-axes of iron.
14. One of them next went forward, and all the rest followed him, singing to a tune;
and then, passing through the lines and heavy-armed troops of the Greeks, they proceeded straight towards the enemy, to attack a. fortress, which appeared easy to be assailed, 15.
and which was situated in front of the city which they call their metro­ polis, occupying the highest point in the country of the Mos­ synœci.
It was about this strong-hold that the present war had arisen ;
for those who for the time being held this posi­ tion, were regarded as chief of all the Mossynæci ;
and they said that the other party had seized it unjustly, and, by ap­ propriating to themselves a common possession, had gained the ascendency over them.
16. Some of the Greeks followed these men, not by orders from their officers, but for the sake of plunder.
While they were advancing, the enemy were quiet for a time, but, as they drew near the fort, they sallied out and put them to flight, killing several of the Barbarians, and some few of the Greeks that went up with them, and continued the pursuit until they saw the main body of the Greeks coming to the rescue.
17. They then turned and fled, and, cutting off the heads of the slain, exhibited them to the Greeks and their own enemies, dancing and singing, at the same time, to some kind of tune.
18.
The Greeks were much vexed on this occasion, because they had rendered the enemy bolder, and because their own men, who had gone out with the party in considerable num­ bers, had run away;
a circumstance which had never before happened during the expedition.
19. Xenophon however, calling the Greeks together, said, “Do not be cast down, sol­ diers, at what has happened, for be assured that the good which has occurred is not less than the evil.
20. In the first place, you are now convinced that those who are to guide us, are in reality enemies to those to whom it is necessary for us also to be enemies.
In the next, those of the Greeks who were regardless of our discipline, and thought themselves able to do as much in conjunction with the Barbarians as with us, have paid the penalty of their rashness ;
so that on any other occasion they will be less inclined to desert our body.
21. And it is now incumbent on you so to prepare yourselves, that you may appear to such of the Barbarians as are your friends to be superior to them in courage, and to prove to your ene­ mies that they will not fight with the same kind of men now, as when they fought with those who were in disorder.”22. Thus they rested for that day.
On the next, when they had sacrificed, and found favourable omens, and had taken their breakfast, they formed themselves in columns, ranging the Barbarians on the left in the same way, and marched forward with the archers between the columns, keep- ing a little within the front ranks of the heavy-armed troops, for some of the enemy's light-armed men ran down and hurled stones at them.
23. These the archers and peltasts tried to keep in check;
the rest of the Greeks proceeded at a slow pace, in the first place, towards the fortress, from which the Barbarians, and the Greeks who were with them, had been repulsed the day before ;
for here the enemy were drawn up to oppose them.
24. The Barbarians awaited the charge of the peltasts, and engaged with them;
but when the heavy- armed came up, they took to flight, when the peltasts immedi­ ately pursued them up the hill to the metropolis, and the heavy-armed followed in order.
25. As soon as they had reached the top, and were close to the houses in the metropo lis, the enemy, being now collected in a body, encountered and hurled lances at them ;
and, using other spears of great thickness and length, such as a man could hardly carry, they endeavoured to defend themselves with them hand to hand.
26.
As the Greeks however did not give way, but engaged them in close combat, they fled also from this part, abandon­ ing the place entirely.
But their king, who resided in a wooden tower,' built upon an eminence, and whom, while he lives there, they all maintain and guard2 in common, would not consent to come out, nor would those who were in the fortress that was first taken,3 but were burnt there toge­ ther with the towers.
27. The Greeks, in ransacking the place, found in the houses stores4 of bread, laid up, as the Mossynœci themselves said, according to their hereditary prac­ tice, and the new corn put by in the straw;
the most of it was spelt.
28. Sliced flesh of dolphins,5 too, was found pic­ kled in jars, and fat of dolphins also in other vessels, which the Mossynœci used as the Greeks use oil.
29.
In the upper part of the houses were vast stores of chestnuts,1 of the broad kind, without any fissure;
these they used in great quantities for food, boiling them and baking loaves of them.
Wine was likewise found, which, when unmixed, seemed sour to the taste by reason of its roughness, but mixed with water, was both fragrant and sweet.
30.
The Greeks, after dining here, proceeded on their march, delivering up the place to the tribe of Mossynœci that had become their allies.
As for the other towns at which they arrived, belonging to the people on that side of the enemy, the Barbarians deserted such as were most accessible, while the inhabitants of others willingly came over to them.
31. Most of these places were situated thus:
they were distant from one another about eighty stadia, some more, some less ;
yet the inhabitants could hear each other calling out from one town to another;
so mountainous and hollow is the country.
32.
When the Greeks, advancing onward, arrived in the country of their friends, they showed them some boys, sons of the richer sort of people, extremely fat, (having been fed on boiled chestnuts,) very soft and fair-skinned, and not far from being equal in height and breadth, painted also on their backs with various colours, and tattooed all over their fore-parts with flowers.
2 33. They wanted to have intercourse in public with the mistresses that the Greeks had with them ;
for such is their custom.
Both the men and women were very fair.. 34. Those engaged in this expedition said that these were the most barbarous of all the people they passed through, and furthest removed from the manners of the Greeks;
for they do those things in a crowd, which other men would do in pri­ vate, or would not venture to do at all;
and they acted, when alone, just as they would have acted in company with others;
they talked to themselves, laughed to themselves, and stopped and danced wherever they happened to be, as if they were ex­ hibiting themselves to others.
The Greeks pass through the territories of the Chalybes, and arrive at Cotyora, a colony from Sinope, in those of the Tibareni.
Not being hos­ pitably received, they subsist by plundering the neighbouring country, and that of the Paphlagonians.
The people of Sinope complain of these depredations, but are appeased by the reply of Xenophon.1.
THROUGH this country, partly hostile and partly friend­ ly, the Greeks proceeded eight days' journey, and arrived among the Chalybes.
This people are few in number, and subject to the Mossynœci;
and the subsistence of most of them is procured by working in iron.
2. They next came to the Tibareni, whose country was much more level, and con­ tained some towns on the sea-coast, not very strongly fortified.
Upon these places the generals were inclined to make an at­ tack, and thus in some degree to benefit the army ;
and accord ingly they did not receive the offerings of hospitality that were sent them from the Tibareni, but ordered those who brought them to wait till they had considered how to act, and then proceeded to sacrifice.
3. After offering several victims, all the augurs at last gave their opinion that the gods by no means approved of war.
They then accepted the presents, and marching on, as through a country belonging to friends, they arrived in two days at Cotyora, a Greek city, a colony from Sinope, situated in the territory of the Tibareni.4.
Thus far the army had proceeded by land.
The length of their journey down the country, from the field of battle near Babylon to Cotyora, was a hundred and twenty-two days' march, six hundred and twenty parasangs, or eighteen thou­ sand six hundred stadia;
and the length of time spent in it was eight months.
5.
Here they stayed forty-five days;
during which they first sacrificed to the gods, and then each of the Greeks, ae­ cording to their tribes celebrated processions and gymnastio games.
6. Their provisions, meanwhile, they took partly from Paphlagonia, and partly from the lands of the Cotyo­ rites ;
for they refused to permit them to purchase, or to re­ ceive their siek within the walls.
7.
During this state of things ambassadors came from the people of Sinope, who were in fear about the city of Cotyora, (for it belonged to them, and the inhabitants paid them tribute,) and about the land, as they had heard that it was being ravaged.
Having arrived at the camp, they said, (Hieronymus, who was thought a man of eloquence, speaking for the rest,) 8. "The people of Sinope, soldiers, have sent us hither, first of all, to offer you commendation, because, being Greeks, you have overcome the Barbarians, and next to con­ gratulate you on haying arrived here safe, as we hear, through many and great struggles.
9. But we think it right that, as we ourselves are Greeks, we should receive favour, and not injury, at the hands of you who are Greeks;
for we have certainly never been aggressors in doing you any ill.
10. The people of Cotyora are colonists of ours, and we gave them this land after having taken it from the Barbarians;
on which ac­ count they pay us an appointed tribute, in the same manner as the people of Cerasus and Trebisond ;
so that whatever evil you do to them, the city of Sinope will consider itself aggrieved by it.
11. We are now informed that, having en­ tered the town by force, you are quartered, some of you, in the houses, and are taking whatever you want from the neighbourhood without having obtained the people's consent.
12. These proceedings we cannot approve, and, if you eontinue to act thus, it will be necessary for us to make friends of Corylas and the Paphlagonians, and whomsoever else we may be able to attach to us."13.
In reply to these complaints Xenophon rose up and spoke in behalf of the army as follows :
"
We, 0 men of Sinope, have come hither, content with having preserved our persons and our arms ;
for to bring away spoil with us, and at the same time to fight with our enemies, was impossible;
14.
and now, since we arrived among the Greek cities, (at Trebisond for example, for there they allowed us to buy,) we have got our provisions by purchase;
and in return for the honours which they did us, and the presents which they gave to the army, we paid them every respect, and abstained from injuring any of the Barbarians that were their friends, while to their enemies, against whom they led us, we did as much harm as we could.
15. Inquire of them, (for the men, whom, through friendship, the city sent along with us as guides, are present here,) what sort of persons they found us.
16 . But whithersoever we come and find no opportunity of purchas­ in,-, whether to a country of Barbarians or of Greeks, we take provisions for ourselves, not tyrannically, but from neces­ sity.
IT.
Thus we made the Carduehi, the Taochi, and the Chaldæans, (not subjects of the king indeed, but very formid­ able people,) our enemies, by being under the necessity of taking provisions from them, as they gave us no opportunity to buy ;
is.
but the Macrones, since they afforded us every facility for purchasing that they could, we regarded, though Barbarians, as friends, and took nothing from them by force.
19. But as for the people of Cotyora, (who, you say, are your subjects,) for whatever we have taken from them they them­ selves are to be blamed;
for they did not make advances to us as friends, but, shutting their gates, would neither admit us within their walls, nor offer us provisions for sale without;
and they alleged that the governor appointed by you was the cause of these proceedings.
20. With regard to your remark that we have entered the city and lodged ourselves in it by force, we requested them to receive our sick under their roofs ;
but, when they would not open their gates, we, effecting an entrance where the place itself would admit us, 1 committed no further act of violence ;
and the sick now lodge in the houses, living upon their own means ;
while we place a guard at the gates, only that our disabled soldiers may not be in the hands of your governor, but that it may be in our power to remove them when we wish.
21. The rest of us, as you see, are en­ camped in order in the open air, prepared, if any one does us a service, to do him a service in return ;
if an injury, to defend ourselves against him.
22. And as to your threat that, if you think proper, you will make Corylas and the Paphlagonians your allies against us, be assured that we, if it be necessary will fight with you both, (for we have already fought with enemies much more numerous than you,) or, if we think fit, we will make the Paphlagonian leader our friend, 23.
for we have heard that he covets both your city and all the other places on the sea.
We shall try to become his friends by as­ sisting him in the attainment of what he desires."24.
After this speech the colleagues of Hecatonymus testi­ fied manifest displeasure at what he had said, and another of them, coming forward, said that they were not come to make war, but to declare that they were friends.
“And if you come," he continued, “ to the city of Sinope, we will receive you there, with tokens of friendship, and, for the present, we will desire the people here to supply you with what they can, for we see that all that you state is true."
25. The people of Cotyora then sent presents to the army, and the generals of the Greeks entertained the ambassadors from Sinope;
and they conversed with one another about many other things that concerned them, and inquired about such particulars as each party wanted to know respecting the remainder of the route.
The Greeks, by the advice of Hccatonymus, resolved to proceed by sea, if the people of Sinope will send them ships enough for theirconveyance.
A project of Xenophon’s to build a city in Pontus is frustrated bythe treachery of Silanus.
Several of the Greeks are inclined to settle in Pontus.1.
SUCH was the end of that day.
On the next, the generals assembled the soldiers, and it was resolved to call in the am­ bassadors from Sinope and consult them about the rest of their journey;
for, if it should be necessary to proceed by land, the Sinopeans seemed likely to prove useful as guides, as they were well acquainted with Paphlagonia ;
or if by sea, it appeared that they would want the aid of the Sinopeans, for they were the only people that seemed able to furnish a suffi­ cient number of ships for transporting the army.
a.
Having requested the attendance of the ambassadors, therefore, they asked their opinion, and desired that, being Greeks, they would in the first place receive them well,' both by being kind to them as Greeks, and by advising them for the best.
3.
Hecatonymus, rising up, first stated in apology for his observation " that they would make the Paphlagonian their friend," that he had said this.
not to imply that they were going to make war upon the Greeks, but that they would prefer the friendship of the Greeks though they had the option of becoming friends to the Barbarians.
When they called upon him to give them his advice, he spoke, with an appeal to the gods, to the following effect:
4. " If I advise you what seems to me to be best, may many good things befall me;
if not, things of a contrary nature;
for that sort of counsel, which is said to be sacred,1 appears now to be required;
and, if I shall be thought to have advised you well, there will be many of you to applaud me, and if ill, many of you to execrate me.
5. I am aware, then, that we ourselves shall have much more trouble if you proceed by sea, for it will be necessary for us to furnish the vessels;
while, if you go by land, it will fall upon you to fight your way.
6. However, I must tell you what I know ;
for I am well acquainted both with the country of the Paphlagonians and with their strength.
As for the country, it presents many beautiful plains, and mountains of a very great height;
7. and I know, in the first place, the part where you must certainly make your entrance into it, for it is impossible to enter it at any other point than where the peaks of a mountain rise to a vast height on each side of the road, which a handful of men in possession of them would be able.
to defend ;
2 and, if they are pre-occupied, not even all the men in the world would be able to force a passage.
These I could show you, if you would send anybody with me.
8. Be­ yond, I know that there are plains, and a body of cavalry which the Barbarians themselves think superior to all the king's cavalry;
and, on a recent occasion, they did not oin him when he summoned them, as their leader1 has too high a spirit to do so.
a.
But if you could even pass the mountains unobserved, or anticipate the enemy in taking pos­ session of them, and could defeat their cavalry, as well as more than a hundred and twenty thousand infantry, in battle on the plain, you would in the next place come to rivers, first to the Thermodon, three hundred feet in breadth, which I consider difficult to pass, especially with a large number of enemies before you, and an equal number following you behind;
next to the Iris, three hundred feet broad also ;
and, thirdly, to the Halys, not less than two furlongs in breadth, which you would be unable to cross without boats ;
and with boats who would supply you ?
The Parthenius, too, at which you would arrive if you were to pass the Halys, is equally impassable.
10. I consider this way, therefore, not merely as difficult, but as ab­ solutely impracticable.
But if you go by sea, you may sail along the coast from hence to Sinope, and from Sinope to Heraclea;
and from Heraclea there will be no difficulty in proceeding either by land or sea, as there are plenty of vessels at Heraclea."
II.
When he had given this advice, some suspected that he had given it through friendship for Corylas, as he was a public guest-friend of his;
others thought that he was to receive a reward for his counsel;
and others, again, imagined that he had thus advised them, in order that they might not, by marching through the territory of the Sinopeans, do any damage to it.
The Greeks however gave their votes for going uy sea.
12.
Xenophon then said, "0 men of Sinope, the soldiers have chosen the mode of travelling which you advise;
and the matter now stands thus;
if the vessels are to be furnished in sufficient numbers, so that not a man of us be left here, we will sail;
but if some of us are to be left here, and others to sail, we shall not go on board the vessels at all ;
13.
for we are sure that wherever we are the stronger, we shall be able both to save ourselves and to get provisions, but that if we are anywhere found weaker than our enemies, it is quite clear wc shall be in the condition of slaves."
14. The ambassadors, on hearing this statement, desired the Greeks to send an embassy to Sinope.
They accordingly sent Callimachus an Arcadian, Ariston an Athenian, and Samolas an Achæan ;
all of whom immediately set out.
15.
In the mean time, when Xenophon contemplated the numerous body of heavy-armed Greeks, as well as the great number of peltasts, archers, slingers, and cavalry, rendered extremely efficient by exercise, that were now in Pontus, where so large a force could not be collected without great expense, it appeared to him that it would be an honourable undertaking to acquire territory and power for Greece by founding a city there.
16. He thought that such a city might became great, when he considered both the number of the Greeks themselves, and that of the surrounding inhabitants of Pontus.
With reference to this project he offered a sacri­ fice, summoning to it Silanus of Ambracia, who had been augur to Cyrus, before he spoke on the subject to any one of the soldiers.
17. Silanus, fearing that the scheme might take effect, and that the army might form a settlement somewhere, spread a report through the army that Xenophon wanted them all to remain there, and form a city, and thus give him fame and power.
is.
But what Silanus himself wished, was to set off for Greece as soon as possible, as lie had saved the three thousand darics that he had received from Cyrus, when, sacrificing for him, he gave a true prediction concerning the ten days.'
19. As to the soldiers, when they heard of the matter, some thought it best to stay there, but the majority were of a different opinion ;
and Timasion the Dardanian and Thorax the Bœotian told some merchants of Heraclea and Sinope who happened to be there, that if they did not procure pay for the troops, so that they might have provisions on the voyage, there would be danger of so great an army remaining in Pontus;
for Xenophon, said they, IS forming this project, and desires us, when the vessels have arrived, suddenly to say to the army, 20. “ Soldiers, we observe that we are now at a loss both how to get provisions for our voyage, and how to benefit our families on returning home.
But if you are inclined to select some spot, wherever you please, in the inhabited country around the Euxine, and to take possession of it, allowing those to go home who are desirous to go, and those who are willing, to settle here, you have ships at command, so that you may make a sudden descent upon any part you may think proper."
21. The merchants, on hearing this account, communicated it to their cities;
and Timasion the Dardanian sent with them Eurymachus, also a Dardanian, and Thorax the Bœotian, to make the same state­ ment.
The people of Sinope and Heraclea, as soon as they learned this, sent to Timasion, and engaged him, on receipt of a certain sum of money, to use his influence in bringing it to pass that the army might sail out of the Euxine.
22. lie willingly listened to this proposal, and made a speech, in an assembly of the soldiers, to the following purport:
" We ought not to give our thoughts, soldiers, to remaining here;
or to esteem any other country as preferable to Greece.
I hear, however, that certain persons are sacrificing with a view to this object, without informing you of it.
23. But, if you will sail out of the Euxine, I engage to give each of you monthly a stater of Cyzicus 1 as pay, computing from the first day of the month ;
and I will then conduct you to Troas, from whence I am an exile, and my city shall aid you, for my countrymen will gladly receive me.
24. I will also guide you to places from which you may get wealth, for I am well acquainted with Æolia, Phrygia, Troas, and all the satrapy of Pharnabazus, partly from being a native of that quarter, and partly from having served there with Clearchus and Dercyl­ lidas."25.
Thorax the Bœotian, who was always contending with Xenophon for the chief command, immediately2 stood up, and said, that if they sailed out of the Euxine, there would be before them the Chersonese,1 a fine and rich country ;
so that such as wished might settle there, and such as were unwilling to do so, might return home;
adding that it was ridiculous, when there was abundance of rich land in Greece, to seek settlements in a country of Barbarians.
26. " And until you arrive there,” said he, " I, as well as Timasion, engage that you shall have pay."
This he said from having learned what the people of Heraelea and Sinope had promised on condition that they sailed away.
Xenophon, in the mean time, was silent.
27. Philesius and Lycon, however, both Achæans, rose up and observed that it was intolerable that Xenophon should privately persuade the soldiers to remain, and sacrifice with a view to their stay, not allowing the army to participate in the sacrifice, and saying nothing on the subject to the general council.
Xenophon was in consequence obliged to rise and speak as follows :
28.
"I sacrifice, as you see, soldiers, to the best of my ability, both for you and for myself, in order that I may say, and think, and do such things as may be most honourable and advantageous both for yourselves and me ;
and I was just now sacrificing about this very consideration, whether it would bo better to proceed to speak and treat with you on this subject, or not to touch on the point at all.
29. Silanus the augur in­ formed me, what was the most important particular, that the victims were favourable, but added (for he knew that I was not unskilled in such matters, from being constantly present at the sacrifices,) that some fraud and treachery was indicated against me by the sacrifices, as being conscious, forsooth, that he himself was treacherously purposing to calumniate me to you ;
for he it was that spread the report that I intended to carry this scheme into execution without gaining your con­ sent.
30. If indeed I had seen you in want, I should have meditated some scheme, of which the result might have been that you, after possessing yourselves of some town,2 might flail home, such of you as were inclined, immediately, and such as were not so, after they had acquired sufficient to be of some benefit to their families.
31. But since I see the people of Heraclea and Sinope sending you vessels to sail in, and individuals here promising you pay from the beginning of the month, it appears to me an excellent thing for us, after getting safe where we wish to be, to receive pay for allowing ourselves to be preserved ;
1 and I myself, accordingly, give up this project, and think that all who have come to me saying that we ought to act in this manner, should give it up likewise.
32. For what I think is this;
that while you continue together, as at present, in large numbers, you are likely to be held in honour, and to find provisions, (since in superior strength lies the privilege of taking what belongs to the weaker ;
) but if you are divided, and your force broken into small bodies, you will neither be able to procure subsistence, nor effect a departure to your satisfaction.
33. My opinion, consequently, is the same with your own, that we ought to set out for Greece, and that if any one remain here, or be found leaving any one be­ hind, before the whole army is in a place of safety, he be brought to trial as a criminal.
And by whomsoever," he added, "these sentiments are approved, let him hold up his hand."
They all held them up.
34. But Silanus cried out in opposition, and attempted to show that such as wished to leave the army ought to be allowed to do so.
This proposition however the soldiers would not endure, but threatened that, if they caught him running away, they would inflict punishment on him.
35. Soon after, when the Heracleans learned that it was resolved to sail out of the Euxine, and that it was Xenophon who had put the matter to the vote, they sent the ships ;
but about the money for pay, which they had promised to Timasion and Thorax, they broke their word.
36. In consequence, those who had engaged for its payment were confounded, and in dread of the army.
Taking with them therefore the rest of the generals, those at least to whom they had communicated what they were previously attempting, (and these were all except Neon of Asina,1 who commanded under Cheirisophus, and Cheirisophus had not yet returned,) they went to Xenophon, and told him that they were sorry for what had been done, and that it seemed the best course to them, since they had vessels, to sail to the river Phasis, and take possession of the country of the Phasians, of whom a grandson of Æetes 2 happened then to be king.
37. Xenophon replied that he would propose nothing of the sort to the troops, "but assemble them yourselves," said he, "and lay the matter before them if you please."
Timasion the Dardanian then gave his opinion that they should not call a general assembly, but that each of the leaders should endeavour, in the first place, to persuade his own men.
They accordingly went off and put this plan in execution.
Xenophon, being accused of encouraging the army to sail to the Phasis, de­ fends himself in a formal speech, and is the means of bringing certain of the soldiers, who had some time before insulted the ambassadors from Cerasus, to punishment.i.
THE soldiers now learned that these matters were in agitation;
and Neon of Asina told them that Xenophon, having brought the other generals over to his side, was re­ solved to deceive the army and take them back again to the Phasis.
2. The soldiers, on hearing this account, were great­ ly displeased, meetings began to be held, and knots collected among them ;
and they gave great reason to fear that they would act as they had done to the heralds of the Colchians and the commissaries of the market;
for as many of them as had not escaped to the sea had been stoned.
3
3. As soon as Xenophon observed this state of things, he thought proper to call the army immediately together, and not to leave them to collect of their own accord.
He therefore ordered the herald to summon a general assembly, 4. and the troops, when they heard the herald’s voice, hastened to the meeting with the greatest alacrity.
Xenophon did not accuse the other generals of having come to him,1 but addressed the troops thus:
5.
“ I hear, soldiers, that some one accuses me of intending to deceive you, and to take you to the Phasis.
Hear me therefore, in the name of the gods, and if I appear to have done wrong, I ought not to depart hence till I have suffered due punishment;
but if, on the contrary, my accusers are proved to be in the wrong, treat them, I beseech you, as they deserve.
6. You doubtless know," he continued, " where the sun rises and where it sets, and that whoever intends to go to Greece must proceed towards the west, and whoever would go to the Barbarians, in the contrary direction towards the east;
and is there any one, then, who would be able deceitfully to persuade you that the sun rises in this quarter and sets in that, sets here, and rises there ? 2 7. You also know that the north wind carries you out of the Euxine Sea towards Greece, and.
the south wind inwards towards the Phasis ;
and you exclaim, when the north wind blows, that it is fair sailing for Greece.
Is it possible, then, that any one could deceive you with re­ gard to this, to induce you to embark when the south wind is blowing?
But you will say, perhaps, I shall put you on board when it is calm.
8. I however shall sail but in one ship, and you in a hundred at least:
and how then could I force you to sail with me against your will, or lead you away by deceit?
9. But I will suppose that you are deceived and bewitched by me, and arrive at the Phasis;
we then land in the country;
you will know very well that you are not in Greece, and I, who have deceived you, shall be but one, while you who have been deceived, will be nearly ten thousand;
with arms in your hands ;
and how could one individual more effectually bring vengeance on himself, than by planning thus concerning himself and you ?
10.
But these charges proceed from foolish men, and men who are jealous of me because I am honoured by you ;
though indeed they arc jealous without reason;
for which of them do I hinder from speaking before you, if he has anything to propose for your advantage, or from fighting, if he wishes, for you and himself, or from watching, if he cares to do so, for your safety?
When you choose officers, do I stand in the way of any one ?
I am ready to resign;
let another1 take the command;
only let him show that lie would do something for your advantage.
11. What I have said, however, upon this point, is sufficient.
But if any one of you thinks that he could of himself have been deceived in this matter, or that any other person could have deceived him in it,2 let him speak and make known his thoughts to us.12. "
IN'lien you are satisfied on this head, do not dis­ perse until you have heard something of a sort of conduct, which, I perceive, is beginning to show itself among the troops;
for if it goes on.
and becomes what it threatens to be, it is time for us to consider about ourselves, that we may not appear in the sight of gods and men, of enemies and friends, to be the basest and most infamous of all men, and bring our­ selves utterly into contempt."
13. The soldiers, on hearing these words, wondered what the matter could be, and desired him to proceed.
He accordingly resumed his speech :
“
Yoti are aware that there were some places upon the mountains belonging to the Barbarians, and in alliance with the people of Cerasus, from which some of the inhabitants came down to us, and offered to sell us cattle for sacrifice, and such other things as they had.
Some of you seem to have gone to the nearest of these places, and to have made some purchases and returned.
14. Clearchus, one of the captains, understanding that this place was small and unguarded, because the people supposed that they were in friendship with us, went against it in the night to plunder it, without telling any of us of his intention.
is.
He had purposed, if he should take the place, not to return again to the army, but, embarking in a vessel, in which his comrades were sailing along the coast, and put­ ting on board whatever he got, to sail clear away out of the Euxine.
His companions in the vessel had concerted all this with him, as I now learn.
16. Assembling therefore as many as he could induce to follow him, he led them towards the place.
But day-light overtook him on his way, and the in­ habitants collecting together, and hurling missiles, and using other weapons, from their places of defence, killed Clearchus and several of the rest;
some few of them retreated to Cera­ sus.
17. These occurrences happened on the day on which we set out hither from Cerasus by land, and while some of those who were to sail1 along the coast were still at Cerasus, not having as yet weighed anchor.
After this, as the people of Cerasus state, three of the older men came from the place, desiring to have an interview with our common assembly.
is.
As they did not find us, they told the people of Cerasus that they wondered why we had thought of attacking them.
The people of Cerasus, however, said that when they told.
them that the outrage had not been committed by public au­ thority, they were delighted, and were going to sail hither to give us an account of what had happened, and to invite those who wished it to take their dead and bury them.
19. But some of the Greeks that had fled happened to be still at Ce­ rasus, and discovering whither the Barbarians were going, had the daring to throw stones at them themselves, and en­ couraged others to do the same.
Thus these men, the three deputies, were stoned to death.20. “
When this crime was committed, some of the people of Cerasus came to us, and gave us an account of the affair.
We, the generals, on listening to it, were greatly concerned at what had happened, and consulted with the men from Cerasus how the dead Greeks might be buried.
21. As we were sit­ ting in council, outside the quarters of the heavy-armed men, we suddenly heard a great outcry of voices, ‘ Strike, strike, throw, throw !' and immediately saw a great number of men running together with stones in their hands, and others pick­ ing them up.
22. The people of Cerasus, as having witnessed what had happened among themselves, retreated in fear to their vessels ;
and there were some of us, by Jove, who were also in fear.
23. I, for my part, went up to them, and asked them what the matter was.
Some of them knew nothing about it;
and yet had stones in their hands.
When at length I met with one who did know, he told me that the commissaries of the market were treating the army in a manner not to be en­ dured.
24. At this moment one of the soldiers perceived the commissary Zetarchus retreating towards the sea, and called out;
the rest, hearing the cry, rushed towards him as if a wild boar or a stag had appeared.
25. The men of Cerasus, seeing the soldiers hurrying in their direction, and thinking that they were coming to attack them, fled in all haste, and threw them­ selves into the sea;
when some of our men threw themselves in likewise, and such as did not know how to swim were drowned.
26. Why do you think that these men fled ?
They had done no wrong;
but they were afraid that some madness, like that of dogs, must have seized our men.
If things are to go on thus, consider what will be the state of our army.
27. You, as a body, will not have the privilege either of commencing war with whom you please, or of breaking it off, but every man that chooses may lead off troops of his own will, on whatever enterprise he thinks proper.
And if any deputies come to you, to ask for peace or anything else, whoever pleases may, by putting them to death, prevent you from hear­ ing the requests of those who apply to you.
as.
Besides, those whom you have all elected generals, will then be of no au­ thority, but whoever may elect himself general, and be inclined to cry '
Throw, throw,' will be able to put to death either officer or private among you, whomsoever he pleases, without a trial, at least if men be found, as in this recent instance, to obey him.29. " Consider, too, what these self-elected leaders have done for you.
If Zelarchus the commissary has done you any wrong, he has sailed off without making any atonement to you ;
if he has done you none, he has fled from the camp for fear of being put to death unjustly and without trial.
30. Those who stoned the deputies have made it unsafe for you alone, of all the Greeks, to go to Cerasus, unless with a power­ ful force;
and with regard to the dead, whom, previously those that killed them invited you to bury, they have rendered it no longer safe for you to carry them off, even though attended with a herald's staff.
Who, indeed, that has killed heralds, will be willing to go as a herald ?
However, we have requested the people of Cerasus to bury them.
31. "If these proceedings be right, let them be sanctioned by you, in order that, as such conduct is to be pursued, every man may procure a guard for himself, and endeavour to pitch his tent in a strong and advantageous position.'
32. But if such acts appear to you rather those of wild beasts than of men, contrive some mode of putting a stop to them;
or, if J'on do not, how, in the name of Jupiter, shall we sacrifice to the gods with any satisfaction, while we are guilty of impious deeds ?
Or how shall we fight with our enemies, if we kill one another ?2 33.
Or what city will receive us with friend­ ship, that sees such lawlessness among us?
Or who, with any confidence, will offer us provisions for sale, if we are found to offend in things of such moment ?3
Or, in the coun­ try where we expected to obtain the praise of all, who will praise us if we bear such a character ?
For I am very certain that we should pronounce others, who should be guilty of such acts, to be bad men."34.
In consequence they all stood up and said that the leaders in these proceedings should suffer punishment ;
that for the future it should be forbidden to enter upon any law­ lessness of the kind, and that whoever attempted any, should be put to death ;
that the generals should bring all such per sons to trial;
and that there should be trials also in case any person had been wronged in any way since Cyrus was killed.
The captains they appointed to be judges.
On the motion of Xenophon, too, and with the concurrence of the augurs, it was resolved to purify the army.
The purification accord­ ingly took place.
A resolution is passed that the generals shall give an account of their con­ duct.
Xenophon is accused by some of the soldiers of having inflicted stripes upon them.
Xenophon acknowledges the facts, but amply justi­ fies his conduct.1.
IT was resolved also that the generals should give an account of their conduct during the time past;
and when they gave it, Philesius and Xanthicles were condemned, for their negligent custody of the cargoes of the merchant ships,1 to pay the sum that was deficient, namely, each twenty minæ ;
2 and Sophænetus was fined ten minæ, because, being chosen a general, he had neglected his duty.
Some also brought accusations against Xenophon, alleging that they had been beaten by him ;
and made their charges on the ground that his conduct had been tyrannical.
2. Xenophon, standing up, called upon him who had spoken first3 to say where he had been beaten.
He replied, " Where we were perishing with the cold, and where the greatest fall of snow was."
3. Xenophon rejoined, "If, during such severe weather as you mention, when provisions were failing us, when we had not wine even to smell to,4 when many of us were exhausted with fatigue, and the enemy were close be­ hind us, if, 1 say, I acted tyrannically at such a time, I ac­ knowledge that I must have been more spiteful even than asses,5 in which they say that from spite fatigue is not pro- duceJ.
4. Tell us, however, for what cause you were beaten.
Did I ask you for anything, and beat you when you would not give it me ?
Or did I demand anything back from you, or was I fighting about any object of affection, or did I abuse you in a fit of Intoxication ?"
5. As lie said that there was nothing of this kind, Xenophon asked him whether lie was one of the heavy-armed men ?
He answered, “ No."
Whether he was one of the peltasts?
He said that he was not, but was a free-man, set to drive a mule by his comrades.
6. Xenophon now recognised him, and asked him, “ Are you the man that was carrying the sick person ?"
"I certainly am," replied he, "for you compelled me to do so, and scattered about the baggage of my comrades."
7. “ The scattering," rejoined Xenophon, "was something in this way;
I distri­ buted it to others to carry, and directed them to bring it to me again ;
and, on receiving it, I restored it all safe to you, after you had produced the man that I gave you in charge.
But hear," he continued, " how the affair happened ;
for it is worth your while.
s.
A man was left behind because he was no longer able to continue his march;
I knew nothing of the man but that he was one of us;
and I obliged you to carry hiin, that he might not perish;
for, as I believe, the enemy were in pursuit of us."
This the man acknowledged.
a. "Then," said Xenophon, “ after I had ordered you to go be­ fore, I soon overtook you, and found you, as I came up with the rear-guard, digging a pit for the purpose of burying the man ;
when I stopped and commended you.
10. But as the man, while we stood by, drew in his leg, all who were present cried out that he was alive;
and you said, ‘He may be as much alive as he likes, for I shall not carry him.'
Upon this I struck you ;
you say but the truth ;
for you seemed to me to have been aware1 that the man was alive."
11. "What then," exclaimed the accuser, "did he the less die, after I had shown him to you ? " “ We shall all die," rejoined Xenc­ phon, "but must we for that reason be buried alive?" 12. At this all the assembly cried out that Xenophon had not beaten him enough.
He then called upon the rest to state on what account each of them had been struck.
is.
But as none of them stood for­ ward, he said, “ I acknowledge, fellow-soldiers, that I have beaten men for leaving their ranks ;
such men as were con­ tent to be saved by our exertions, and, while we marched in order and fought where it was necessary, tried, by quitting their places, and hurrying on before us, to get plunder, and gain in that respect an advantage over us.
Had we all acted in this way, we should all have perished.
14. I also struck some, and forced them to march, who were giving way to in­ action, unwilling to rise, and abandoning themselves to the enemy ;
for I myself, when I was onee waiting, during tIle excessive cold, for some of the men to pack up their baggage, and had sat for a considerable time, found that I could hardly get up and stretch my legs.
15. Having therefore had ex­ perience in my own person, whenever afterwards I saw any other sitting down and indulging in sloth, I drove him on ;
for motion and manful exertion created a certain warmth and suppleness, but sitting and inaction, I observed, contributed to the congealing of the blood, and the mortification of the toes, which you know that many have suffered.
16. Others, perhaps, who had loitered behind from indolence, and who hindered both you who were in front, and us who were in the rear, from advancing, I may have struck with my fist, that they might not be struck with the spear of the enemy.
17. Those, therefore, who have thus been preserved, may now, if they have suffered anything from me contrary to justice, ob­ tain redress;
but if they had fallen into the hands of the enemy, what injury could they have suffered of such magni­ tulle, as that they would ever have claimed to get satisfaction for it!
1 is.
My case," he proceeded, “ is plain ;
for if I have punished any one for his good, I am willing to make such atonement as parents make to their children and masters to their scholars.
Surgeons, too, cut and cauterize for the good of their patients.
19. But if you imagine that I acted thus from a love of tyranny, consider that I have now, through the favour of the gods, more spirit than I had then, and am bolder now than I then was, and drink a greater quantity of wine, and yet strike no one;
for I see you now in a calm ;
an.
but when a storm rises, and a great sea sets in, do you not observe that the commander in the prow,' even for a mere nod, is angry with those in the fore-part of the vessel, and the steersman angry with those in the stern, because, in such circumstances, even small mistakes are sufficient to ruin every­ thing?
21. Even you yourselves, however, have pronounced that I struck these men, on those occasions, with justice, for you stood by with swords, not voting-pebbles, in your hands and might have taken their part if you had thought proper.
But, by Jupiter, you neither took their part, nor joined with me in punishing the disorderly;
22.
and you have in conse­ quence, by letting them alone, given encouragement to.
the bad among them to grow audacious;
for you will find, I think, if you will but examine, that those who were then the worst, are now the most audacious characters.
23. Boiscus, for instance, the Thessalian boxer, strove earnestly, on pre­ tence of sickness, not to carry his shield ;
and now, as I hear, he has robbed many of the people of Cotyora.
24. If there­ fore you are wise, you will treat this man in a way, the re­ verse of that in which they treat dogs ;
for dogs, when they are spiteful, men tie up in the day, and let loose in the night;
but him, if you exercise your judgment, you will tie lip in the night, and let loose only by day.
25. But I wonder," lie added, " why, if I gave offence to any of you, you bear it in mind, and do not fail to speak of it, while, if I relieved any of you during the cold, or kept off any enemy from you, or supplied any of you, in any way, when sick and in want, no one makes mention of these services;
nor, if I have commend­ ed any one for good conduct in any case, or have honoured any man, as far as I could, for valiant exertion, does any of you remember these occurrences.
26. Yet is it more hon­ ourable, and just, and upright, and pleasing, to treasure in the memory good acts than bad.
"They accordingly rose up, and called to mind his services ;
1 and the result was2 that things were settled satisfactorily.
The Greeks receive an embassy from the satrap of Paphlagonia, with whom they make peace.
They sail from Cotyora to Sinope, where they deter­ mine to elect a commander-in-chief, and fix upon Xenophon, who declines the office;
and they then choose Cheirisopitus, who had just returned with vessels from Anaxibius.1.
FROM this time the Greeks, during their stay here, sub­ sisted partly by purchasing provisions, and partly by plunder­ ing the country of Paphlagonia;
while the Paphlagonians, on their part, secretly intercepted, and with great adroitness, the straggling soldiers, and made attempts, during the night, to annoy those who were encamped at the out-posts.

As this verb has no substantive dependent on t, the critics have been in doubt what turn to give it.
Schneider᾽s method has obtained most favour:
"Commemorabant beneficia Xenophontis.”
Amasæus gives “ se memores esse testificati sunt, which is much to the same purpose.
There is no other suggestion worth notice.
sequence of these proceedings they conceived the most hostile feelings toward each other.
2. Corylas, however, who was then governor of Paphlagonia, sent deputies to the Greeks with horses and beautiful robes, to say that “ Corylas was desirous neither to injure the Greeks nor to receive injury from them."
3. The generals replied, that “ they would consider of the matter with the army but received them, at the same time, with hospitality, and invited such of the officers as they thought most eligible1 to meet them ;
4.
when, having killed some of the oxen that they had captured, and other cattle, they set before them a plentiful entertainment, of which they partook reclining on mats made of grassy and drank out of horn cups which they had found in the country.
5.
As soon as the libations were over, and they had sung the pæan, two Thracians rose up, and danced in full armour, to the sound of a pipe ;
they leaped very high, and with great agility, and wielded their swords;
and at last one struck the other, in such a manner that every one thought he had killed him, 6.
(he fell, however, artfully,) and the Paphlagonians cried out;
the other, having despoiled him of his arms, went out singing the Sitalces;
3 while other Thracians carried off the man as if lie had been dead;
though indeed he had suffered no hurt.
7. Afterwards some Ænians and Magnesi­ ans stood up, and danced what they call the Carpæan4 dance, in heavy arms.
8. The nature of the dance was as follows.
One man, having laid aside his arms, sows, and drives a yoke of oxen, frequently turning to look back as if he were afraid.
A robber then approaches, and the other man, when he per­ ceives him, snatches up his arms and runs to meet him, and fights with him in defence of his yoke of oxen ;
(and the men acted all this keeping time to the pipe ;
) but at last the robber, binding the other man, leads him off with his oxen.
Some­ times, however, the ploughman binds the robber, and then, having fastened him to his oxen, drives him off with his hands tied behind him.
9.
Next came forward a Mysian, with a light shield in each hand, and danced, sometimes acting as if two adversaries were attacking him ;
sometimes he used his shields as if en­ gaged with only one ;
sometimes he whirled about, and threw a summerset, still keeping the shields in his hands, presenting an interesting spectacle.
in.
At last he danced the Persian dance,!
clashing his shields together, sinking on his knees, and rising again;
and all this he performed in time to the pipe.
11.
After him some Mantineans, and others of the Arcadi­ ans, coming forward and taking their stand, armed as hand­ somely as they could equip themselves, moved along in time, accompanied by a pipe tuned for the war-movement,2 and sung the pæan, and danced in the same manner as in the pro­ cessions to the gods.
The Paphlagonians, looking on, testified their astonishment that all the dances were performed in armour.
12. The Mysian, observing that they were surprised at the exhibition, and prevailing on one of the Arcadians, who had a female dancer, to let her come in, brought her forward, equipping her as handsomely as lie could, and giving her a light buckler.
She danced the Pyrrhic dance3 with great agility, and a general clapping followed ;
13.
and the Paphla- gonians asked whether the women fought along with the men;
when they replied that it was the women who had driven the king from his camp.
1
This was the conclusion of the enter­ tainments for that night.
14.
Next day the generals brought the deputies before the army ;
and it was resolved by the soldiers that they would neither injure the Paphlagonians nor suffer any injury from them."
The deputies then took their departure ;
and the Greeks, as a sufficient number of ships seemed to be ready, went on board, and sailed all that day and the following night, with a fair wind, keeping Paphlagonia on the left;
15.
and the day after, they arrived at Sinope, and east anchor in Har­ mene, the harbour of that city.
The Sinopeans are situate in the Paphlagonian territory, but are colonists of the Milesians.
They sent the Greeks, as a mark of hospitality, three thousand medimni 2 of flour, and fifteen hundred ceramia 3 of wine.
16. Here Cheirisophus now arrived with some galleys:
the soldiers expected that he was bringing them something;
but he brought them nothing.
He announced however that Anaxi­ bius the admiral, and the rest of the Lacedæmonians, gave them great praise ;
and that Anaxibius4 engaged, if they would come away from the Euxine, that they should have pay.
17.
The troops stayed five days at Harmene ;
and as they considered that they were now near Greece, it became an object with them, even more than before, to return home with some booty in their possession.
is.
And they thought that, if they made choice of one general, that single person would be better able to manage the army, whether by night or day, than it was managed under the existing government of several;
so that if it should be necessary for them, in any ease, to conceal their designs, they would be concealed more effectually, and if to anticipate the movements of the enemy, they would be less likely to be behind-hand;
as there would then be no need of conferences, but whatever was determined by the one commander would be put in execution ;
whereas the generals had hitherto done everything by the vote of the majority..
19. While they were contemplating this scheme, they turned their thoughts to Xenophon ;
and the captains came to him and said that the army was of this opinion, and each, express­ ing his good-will towards him, endeavoured to induce him to undertake the command.
20. Xenophon was in some degred inclined to listen to the proposal, when he reflected that, by this means, greater honour would fall to him, that his name would reach his friends and his country with greater glory, and that possibly he might also be the cause of some advan­ tage to the army.
21. Such considerations influenced him to desire to become commander-in-chief.
But when, on the other hand, he remembered how uncertain it is to all men what the future will produce, and that, consequently, he would be in danger of losing the reputation which he had already acquired, he felt uncertain how to act.
22.
While he was perplexed as to his decision, it appeared to him that the best thing that he could do was to lay the matter before the gods;
and having placed by the altar two victims,2 he sacrificed to Jupiter the King, who had been pointed out to him as the god that he should consult, by the oracle at Delphi;
and he thought that he had received from that god the dream which he saw, when he was first appointed to take charge of the army.
23. He called to mind also, that when he was going from Ephesus to join Cyrus, an eagle cried on his right, in a sitting posture however, which, as the augur, who accompanied him, said, was an omen portending something great, above the fortunes of a private individual;
foretelling what was honourable, but toilsome, since other birds attack the eagle chiefly when sitting;
and he added that the omen was not at all indicative of gain, as the eagle mostly secured prey when flying.
24. While he was sacri­ ficing on the present occasion, the god clearly directed him not to seek any additional command, and not to accept it if they should elect him ;
and this was the issue of the matter.
is.
The army however came together, and all suggested that one commander should be chosen;
and, as it was resolved to do so, they proposed Xenophon.
As it seemed evident too that they would elect him, if any one should put it to the vote, he rose up and spoke as follows :
26.
“My fellow-soldiers, I am delighted, as I have the feelings of a man, at receiving honour from you, and am grateful for it, and pray that the gods may grant me to be the author of some advantage to you ;
but that I should be preferred to be your leader, when a Lacedæmonian is present, appears likely to be of no advan­ tage either to you or me;
on the contrary, it seems probable that if you should require assistance from them, you would on this very account be less likely to obtain it.
I moreover think such dignity by no means safe for me;
27.
for I see that the Lacedæmonians never ceased making war on my country until they made the whole people acknowledge that the Lacedæmonians were masters of them as well as of others;
1 28.
though, when they made this confession, they at once desisted from hostilities, and no longer besieged the city.
If therefore, seeing this state of things, I should seem, where I have the power, to render their supremacy uninfluential, I am apprehensive lest I should very soon be reminded of my duty 29.
As to your opinion, that there will be less faction among you under one commander than under many, be assured that, if you choose another, you will not find me factious;
for I consider that he who in war quarrels with his commander, quarrels with his own safety;
whereas, if you should elect me, I should not wonder if you should find people show resentment against both you and myself.
"30.
After he had thus spoken, far more persons than before rose up, and said that he ought to take upon him the com­ mand.
Agasias of Stymphalus said that it would be ridiculous if things should be in such a state, since the Lacedæmonians might then be enraged even if a party met to sup together did not choose a Lacedæmonian as president of their ban­ quet.
"
If such be the case," added he, "it is not proper even tor us, it would seem, to be captains, because we are Arcadians."
Upon this the assembly showed by a murmur their opinion that Agasias had spoken well.
31.
Xenophon, seeing that there was need of something additional on his part, came forward and said, " But, my fellow-soldiers, that you may be fully informed on this subject, I swear to you by all the gods and goddesses, that after 1 learned your inclination, I sought to ascertain by sacrifice whether it would be better for you to confer this command upon me, and for me to undertake it, or not;
and they gave me such manifest signs, by the victims, that even an untaught person1 would have understood that I ought to decline the command."
32. They in consequence chose Cheirisophus, who, when he was elected, stood forward and said, “ Be as­ sured of this, my fellow-soldiers, that I should have made no factious opposition, if you had chosen another.
However,” added he, "you have done a service to Xenophon by not electing him, as Dexippus2 has recently been accusing him to Anaxibius, as far as he could, although I tried as much as possible to silence him.
Dexippus3 also said that he thought Xenophon 3 would rather be joined in command with Timasion, a Dardanian, over the army of Clearchus, than with himself, a Lacedæmonian.
33. But,” he continued, “ since you have chosen me, I will endeavour, on my part, to do you all the service that I can.
Prepare yourselves, accordingly, to sail to-morrow, if it be weather for sailing.
Our course will be for Heraclea, and it is incumbent on you all to do your utmost to reach it.
Of other matters we will consider when we have arrived there."CHAPTER II.
The Greeks sail to Heraclea, where disagreements arise among them, and they separate into three parties;
one, the most numerous, formed of Arcadians and Achæans, who create for themselves ten captains;
a second attached to Cheirisophus;
and a third to Xenophon.1.
WEIGHING anchor from hence the next day, they sailed with a fair wind along the coast for two days.
In their course they saw the Beach of Jason, where the Argo is said to have been moored;
and the mouths of certain rivers, first that of the Thermodon, then that of the Iris, next that of the Halys, and finally that of the Parthenius.
After sailing by the last, they arrived at Heraclea, a Greek city, a colony of Megara, situate in the territory of the Maryandyni.
2. They came to anchor near the Acherusian Peninsula, where Her­ cules is said to have gone down to bring up the dog Cerberus, and where they now show marks of his descent to the depth of more than two stadia.
3. The people of Heraclea sent the Greeks, as tokens of hospitality, three thousand medimni1 of barley-meal, and two thousand ceramia2 of wine, with twenty oxen and a hundred sheep.
Here a river named Lycus runs through the plain, in breadth about two hundred feet.
4.
The soldiers, assembling together began to deliberate, with regard to the rest of the way, whether it were proper to proceed by land or sea, until they were beyond the Euxine.
Lycon, an Achæan, rising up, said, " I wonder at the generals, my fellow-soldiers, for not endeavouring to procure us money to buy provisions;
for the presents received will not furnish subsistence to the army for three days ;
nor is there any place from whence we can get provisions as we proceed on our journey.
It appears to me, therefore, that we ought to ask of the people of Heraclea not less than three thousand Cyzicene staters."
3 5. Another exclaimed, "Not less than ten thousand," and proposed that, having chosen deputies, we should send them at once to the city, while we were sitting there, and hear what report they brought, and take measures accordingly.
6. They then proposed, as deputies, first Chei­ risophus, because he was general-in-chief, and others then named Xenophon;
but both resolutely refused;
for they concurred in opinion that they ought not to compel a Greek city, and one in friendship with them, to supply them with anything that the inhabitants did not offer of their own accord.
7. As they showed themselves resolved, therefore, not to go, the army sent Lycon the Achæan, Callimachus a Parrhasian, and Agasias of Stymphalus;
who, going to the town, informed the people of the resolutions just passed.
It waS said, too, that Lycon even threatened them with violence, if they did not comply with these demands.
8. The Heracleans listened to them, and said that they would consider of the matter, and then immediately collected their property out of the fields, and conveyed the provisions exposed for sale into the city.
At the same time the gates were shut, and armed men appeared upon the walls.
9.
In consequence, the authors of these dissensions accused the generals of having defeated their plan ;
and the Arcadians and Achæans began to hold meetings together, Callimachus the Parrhasian and Lycon the Achæan being mostly at their head.
10. The remarks among them were, that it was dis­ graceful that one Athenian, who had brought no force to the army, should have the command of Peloponnesians and Lace­ dæmonians ;
that they had the labour, and others the profit, although they themselves had secured the general safety ;
for that those who had accomplished this object were Arcadians and Achæans, and that the rest of the army was compara­ tively nothing;
(and in reality more than half the army were Arcadians and Achæans ;
) 11.
and therefore these, they said, if they were wise, should unite together, and, choosing leaders for themselves, should proceed on their way separately, and endeavour to secure themselves something to their profit.
12. To this proposal assent was given;
and whatever Arcadians and Achæans were with Cheirisophus, leaving him and Xenophon, united with the rest, and all chose ten captains of their own;
and they appointed that these should carry into execution whatever should be decided by the vote of the ma­ jority.
The command of Cheirisophus over the whole army was thus ended on the sixth or seventh day after he had been elected.
13.
Xenophon was inclined to pursue his way in company with them, thinking that this method would be safer than for each to proceed separately.
But Neon persuaded him to go by himself, as having heard from Cheirisophus that Cleander the governor of Byzantium had said that he would come with some galleys to the harbour of Calpe;
14.
and he gave Xenophon this advice, therefore, in order that no one else might take advantage of this opportunity, but that they themselves only, and their own soldiers, might sail on board these galleys.
As for Cheirisophus, who was both disheartened at what had oc­ curred, and who from that time conceived a disgust at the army, he allowed Xenophon to act as he thought proper.
15. Xenophon was also inclined to detach himself from the army altogether, and to sail away ;
but as he was sacrificing to Hercules the Conductor, and consulting him whether it would be better and more advisable to march in company with such of the soldiers as remained, or to take leave of them, the god sig­ nified by the victims that he should march with them.
16. The army was thus divided into three bodies;
the Arcadians and Achæans, to the number of more than four thousand five hun­ dred men, all heavy-armed;
the heavy-armed with Cheiriso­ phus, in number fourteen hundred, with seven hundred pel­ tasts, the Thracians of Clearchus;
and seventeen hundred heavy-armed men, with three hundred peltasts, under Xeno­ phon, who was the only one that had any cavalry, a body of about forty horsemen.
17.
The Arcadians, having procured ships from the people of Heraclea, were the first to set sail, with the view of getting as much booty as they could by making a sudden descent upon the Bithynians, and accordingly disembarked at the harbour of Calpe, somewhere about the middle of Thrace, is.
Chei­ risophus, proceeding straight from the city of Heraclea, marched through the territory belonging to it;
but when h. entered Thrace, he kept along near the sea, for he was then in ill-health.
19. Xenophon, having obtained vessels, landed on the confines of Thrace and the region of Heraclea, and pur­ sued his way through the inland parts.
The Arcadians land at Calpe, and make an incursion into the territory of the Bithynians, where they are defeated by the enemy, and in danger of being cut to pieces;
Xenophon proceeds to rescue them.
All the Greeks join Cheirisophus at Calpe.
1 I. EACH of these three parties fared as follows.
The Ar­ cadians, disembarking by night at the port of Calpe, marched off to attack the nearest villages, lying about thirty stadia from the sea.
As soon as it was light, each of the officers led his own division against a village;
but against any village that appeared larger than the rest, they led two divisions together.
2. They fixed also upon a hill on which they were all to re-assemble.
As they fell upon the people unexpectedly, they seized a great number of slaves and surrounded several flocks of cattle.
A.
But the Thracians,1 as fast as they escaped, collected themselves into a body;
and, as they were light-armed, the number that escaped, even from the very hands of the heavy- armed men, was great.
As soon as they were collected, they proceeded, in the first place, to fall upon the division of Smi­ cres, one of the Arcadian captains, who was marching away to the place agreed upon, and carrying with him considerable booty.
5. For a while the Greeks defended themselves as they pursued their march, but, as they were crossing a ravine, the Thracians put them to the rout, and killed Smicres and all his party.
Of another division of the ten captains, too, that of Hegesander, they left only eight men alive, Hegesander himself being one of those that escaped.
6. The other cap­ tains joined him at the appointed spot, some with difficulty, and others without any.
2
The Thracians, however, in conse­ quence of having met with this success, cheered on one another, and assembled in great spirits during the night.
At day-break, numbers of horsemen and peltasts ranged them­ selves in a circle round the hill upon which the Greeks had encamped;
7. and as more came flocking to them, they at­ tacked the heavy-armed men without danger, for the Greeks had neither archers, nor javelin-men, nor a single horseman, while the Thracians, running and riding up, hurled their darts among them, and when the Greeks offered to attack them, retreated with ease.
8. Some attempted one part, and some another;
and many of the assailed were wounded, but none of the assailants.
The Greeks were in consequence un­ able to move from the spot, and at last the Thracians cut them off even from water.
9. As their distress was great, they began to speak of terms of surrender;
and other points were agreed upon between them, but when the Greeks de­ manded hostages, the Thracians refused to give them;
and upon this the treaty was stopped.
Such were the fortunes of the Arcadians.
10.
Cheirisophus, meanwhile, advancing unmolested along the coast, arrived at the harbour of Calpe.
As for Xenophon, while he was marching through the middle of the country, his horsemen, riding on before him, fell in with some am­ bassadors who were on their journey to some place.
As they were conducted to Xenophon, he inquired of them whether they had anywhere heard of another Greek army.
11. They gave him, in reply, an account of all that had occurred, saying that the Greeks were then besieged upon a hill, and that the whole force of the Thracians was collected round them.
lie therefore had these men strictly guarded, that they might act as guides wherever it might be necessary, and then, after stationing scouts, he called together his soldiers and addressed them thus:
12.
" Soldiers, some of the Areadians are killed, and others are besieged upon a hill;
and I think that, if they are de­ stroyed, there will be no hope of safety for us, the enemy being so numerous and so daring.
13. It seems best for us, therefore, to march to their relief with all possible speed, that, if they still survive, we may join with them in their struggle, and not, being left alone, meet danger alone.
14. Let us for the present, then, pitch our camp, marching on, however, un­ til it seems time to sup,1 and whilst we are on the march, let Timasion, with the horse, ride on before, but keeping us still in sight, and let him reconnoitre the country in front, that nothing may take us by surprise."
15. He despatched, at the same time, some of the most active of the light-armed men to the parts on either flank, and to the hills, that if they saw any­ thing threatening in any quarter, they might give notice of it.
He ordered them also to burn whatever combustible matter they met with ;
16.
"for," said he, " we could not flee from hence to any place of refuge;
since it is a long way to go back to Heraclea, and a long way to go over to Chrysopolis ;
and the enemy are close at hand.
To the harbour of Calpe, indeed, where we suppose Cheirisophus to be, if he is safe, tIle dis­ tance is but short;
but even there, there are neither vessels in which we can sail from the place, nor subsistence, if we remain, even for a single day.
17. Should those who are be­ sieged, however, be left to perish, it will be less advantageous for us to face danger in conjunction with the troops of Chei­ risophus only, than, if the besieged are preserved, to unite all our forces, and struggle for our safety together.
But we must go resolved in mind that we have now either to die gloriously, or achieve a most honourable exploit in the preservation of so many Greeks.
is.
Perhaps some divinity orders it thus, who wishes to humble those that spoke boastfully, ns if they were superior to us in wisdom, and to render us, who com­ mence all our proceedings by consulting the gods, more hon­ onred than they are.
You must follow, then, your leaders, and pay attention to them, that you may be ready to execute what they order."19.
Having spoken thus, he led them forward.
The cavalry, scattering themselves about as far as was safe, spread fire wherever they went, while the peltasts, marching abreast of them along the heights, burned whatever they found that was combustible, as did the main body also, if they met with anything left unburned by the others;
so that the whole country seemed to be on fire, and the Greek force to be very numerous.
20. As soon as it was time, they mounted a hill and encamped, when they caught sight of the enemy's fires, which were distant about forty stadia;
and they them­ selves then made as many fires as they could.
21. But as soon as they had supped, orders were given to put out all the fires;
and, having appointed sentinels, they went to sleep for the night.
At dawn of day, after praying to the gods, and arranging themselves for battle, they continued their march with as much haste as they could.
22. Timasion and the cavalry, taking the guides with them, and riding on before the rest, found themselves, before they were aware, upon the hill where the Greeks had been besieged, but saw no troops, either of friends or enemies, but only some old men and women, and a few sheep and oxen that had been left behind;
and this state of things they reported to Xenophon and the army.
23. At first they wondered what could have happened ;
but at length they learned from the people who were left that the Thracians had gone off at the close of the evening and the Greeks in the morning, but whither they did not know.
24.
Xenophon and his party, on hearing this account, packed up their baggage, after they had breakfasted, and pursued their journey, wishing, as soon as possible, to join the rest of the Greeks at the harbour of Calpe, As they proceeded, they perceived the track of the Arcadians and Achæans on the way to Calpe;
and when they met, they were pleased to see one another, and embraced like brothers.
25. The Ar­ cadians then asked Xenophon's men why they had put out their fires, 1 " for we," said they, " thought at first, when we saw no more fires, that you were coming to attack the enemy in the night;
(and the enemy themselves, as they appeared to its, went off under this apprehension, for they disappeared about that time;
) 26.
but as you did not come, and the time passed by, we concluded that you, hearing of our situation, had been seized with alarm, and had retreated to the sea- coast;
and we determined not to be far behind you.
Accord­ ingly we also marched in this direction.
Description of Calpe.
The army resolve that it shall be a capital offence to propose another separation.
Neon leads out a party of two thousand men to get provisions, contrary to the omens ;
he is attacked by Pharnabazus, and obliged to retire with the loss of five hundred men.
Xenophon covers his retreat.
I. THIS day they remained encamped upon the shore near the port.
The spot which is called the harbour of Calpe, is situate in Asiatic Thrace;
and this division of Thrace, begin­ ring from the mouth of the Euxine Sea, extends on the right )f a person sailing into the Euxine, as far as Heraclea.
2. From Byzantium to Heraclea it is a long day's passage for a galley with oars;
and in the space between these cities there is no other town belonging to the Greeks or their allies ;
but the Bithynian Thracians occupy it;
and whatever Greeks they capture, cast ashore by shipwreck or any other accident, they are said to treat with great cruelty.
3. The harbour of Calpe itself lies half-way between Heraclea and Byzantium, as people sail from either side.
1
On the sea there is a pro­ montory jutting out;
that part of it which reaches down into the water is a steep rock in height, where it is lowest, not less than twenty fathoms ;
the neck of the promontory, which reaches up to the mainland, is in breadth about four hundred feet;
and the space within the neck is large enough to afford accommodation for ten thousand men.
4. The harbour lies close under the rock, with its coast toward the west.
A spring of fresh water, flowing copiously, is close by the sea, and under cover of the promontory.
Abundance of wood, of various other sorts, but especially of such as is good for ship-building,3 grows along the coast.
5. The mountain 4 at the harbour5 extends inland about twenty stadia, and this part of it has a soil of mould, free from stones;
the other part along the sea, to the distance of more than twenty stadia, is covered with plenty of large trees of every kind.
6. The surrounding country is beautiful and of great extent, and there are in it many populous villages ;
for the soil produces barley, wheat, all kinds of leguminous vegetables, millet, sesame, figs in abundance, plenty of vines yielding a sweet wine, and everything else but olive-trees.
7. Such is the nature of the country.
The Greeks took up their quarters on the shore by the sea.
In the part which might have been ground for a city6 they were unwilling to encamp;
for even their approach to it appeared to have been the effect of some insidious design, from the belief that certain persons were desirous to found a city there.
8. For most of the soldiers had sailed from home upon this service, not from want of subsistence, but from hav­ ing heard of the merit of Cyrus, some even bringing men with them, others having spent money on the enterprise, others having left their fathers and mothers, others their chil­ dren, in hope of returning when they had collected money for them, for they heard that other Greeks who were with Cyrus were acquiring considerable wealth.
1 Being men of such character, they longed to return in safety to Greece.9.
When the day after their meeting together began to dawn, Xenophon offered sacrifice with regard to an expedi­ tion, for it was necessary to lead out the troops to get provi­ sions ;
and he was also thinking of burying the dead.
As the victims were favourable, the Arcadians also accompanied him, and buried the greatest part of the dead where they had severally fallen ;
for they had now lain five days, and it was no longer possible to bring them away;
some of them how­ ever they gathered together out of the roads, and buried as becomingly as they could with the means at their command;
while for those whom they could not find they erected a large cenotaph, [with a great funeral pile,] 2 and put garlands upon it.
10. Having performed these rites, they returned to their camp, and, after they had supped, went to rest.
Next day all the soldiers held a meeting;
(Agasias of Stymphalus, one of the captains, and Hieronymus of Elis, also a captain, and others, the oldest of the Arcadian officers, were the most active in bringing them together;
) 11.
and they passed a resolution, that if any one for the future should pro­ pose to divide the army, he should be punished with death;
and that the army should return homewards in the same order in which it was before,1 and that the former leaders should resume the command.
Cheirisophus was now dead, from having taken some drug2 during a fever;
and Neon of Asina took his place.
12. After this Xenophon stood up and said, " It seems evi­ dent, fellow-soldiers, that we must pursue our journey by land, for we have no ships;
and it is necessary for us to set out at once, for there are no provisions for us if we remain.
We will therefore," he continued, " offer sacrifice ;
and you must prepare yourselves, if ever you did so, to fight;
for the enemy have recovered their spirit." is.
The generals then offered sacrifice;
and Arexion the Arcadian assisted as augur;
for Silanus of Ambracia had already fled, having hired a vessel from Heraclea.
They sacrificed with a view to their departure, but the victims were not favourable.
14. This day therefore they rested.
Some had the boldness to say that Xenophon, from a desire to settle a colony in the place, had prevailed on the augur to say that the victims were unfavour­ able to their departure, 15.
Xenophon, in consequence, having made proclamation that whoever wished might be present at a sacrifice on the morrow, and having given notice also, that if there was any augur among the soldiers, he should attend to inspect the victims with them, made another sacrifice, and a great number of persons were present at it;
16.
but though they sacrificed again three times with reference to their de­ parture, the victims were still unfavourable to it.
The soldiers were on this account extremely uneasy, for the provisions which they had brought with them were exhausted, and there was no place near for them to purchase any.
IT.
They therefore held another meeting, and Xenophon Raid, " The victims, as you see, fellow-soldiers, are not yet favourable for our departure;
and I see that you are in want of provisions.
It seems to me necessary, therefore, to offer sacrifice with regard to this matter." is.
Here some one rose up and said, "
It is with good reason, indeed, that the victims are unfavourable ;
for, as I heard from a person belonging to a vessel that came in yesterday by accident, Cleander, the governor of Byzantium, is on the point of coming hither with transport vessels and galleys."
19. In consequence they all resolved to stay.
But it was necessary to go out for provi­ sions ;
and to this end sacrifice was again offered three times, but the victims were still unfavourable.
The soldiers now came to Xenophon's tent, and told him that they had no provisions.
He however replied, that he would not lead them out while the victims were adverse.
an.
The next day sacrifice was offered again, and, as all were concerned, almost the whole army crowded around the sacrifice ;
and the victims fell short.
Still the generals did not lead out the troops, but called them, however, together;
21.
and Xenophon said, "Perhaps the enemy may be assem­ bled in a body, and it may be necessary for us to fight:
if, therefore, leaving our baggage in the strong part of the ground, we march out prepared for battle, the victims may possibly prove more favourable to us."
22. But the soldiers, on hear­ ing this observation, cried out that it was of no use to lead them to the part that he mentioned, but that they ought to sacrifice without delay.
Sheep were no longer to be had, but they bought an ox that was yoked to a waggon, and sacrificed it;
and Xenophon begged Cleaner the Arcadian to be on the alert if anything in the sacrifice should appear propitious.
1
But not even on this occasion were the signs favourable.
23.
Neon was now general in the place of Cheirisophus, and when he saw how the men were suffering from want of food, was desirous to get them relief, and having found a man of Heraclea, who said that lie knew of some villages in the neighbourhood, from which it might be possible to procure provisions, he made proclamation that wnoever was willing might go out to get a supply as there would be a guide to conduct them.
A party accordingly proceeded from the camp, to the number of two thoasand, equipped with spears, leather bags, sacks, and other things for holding what they might find.
24. But when they had reached the villages, and had dispersed themselves to plunder, the cavalry of Pharnabazus first 1 fell upon them, for they had come to aid the Bithynians, designing, if they could, in conjunction with them, to prevent the Greeks from pene­ trating into Phrygia.
These horsemen cut off not less than five hundred of the Gretks;
the rest fled to the mountain.
25.
One of those who escaped immediately carried the news of the occurrence to the camp ;
and Xenophon, as the victims had not been propitious that day, took an ox from a waggon, (for there were no other cattle,) and, after sacrificing it, went forth to give aid, with all the other soldiers not above thirty years of age.
26. They brought off the rest of the party, and returned to the camp.
It was now about sunset, and the Greeks were taking their supper in great despondency, when some of the Bithynians, coming suddenly upon the advanced guard through the thick­ ets, killed part of them, and pursued the rest to the camp.
27. A great outcry arising, all the Greeks ran to their arms;
but it did not seem safe to pursue the enemy, or break up their camp, in the night, for the country was full of wood;
and they therefore passed the night under arms, covered by sum dent out-posts.
The Greeks, moved by their previous dangers, at length consent to encamp in the strong part of the ground.
Xenophon, haying sacrificed, and placed a guard in the camp, led out the troops, who, after burying the dead that they found on the way, and possessing themselves of some booty from the villages, perceive the Barbarians posted upon a hill.
They proceed to attack them, and though obstructed by a valley difficult to cross, are animated by the valour and eloquence of Xenophon to achieve a successful issue.
1.
IN this manner they passed the night.
At day-break the generals proceeded to the strong part of the ground;
2 and the men followed, bringing with them their arms and baggage.
Before it was time for dinner, they completed a trench on the side where the entrance to the place was, and fenced the whole length with palisades, leaving three gates.
A vessel meanwhile had arrived from Heraclea, bringing barley-meal, cattle, and wine.
2.
Xenophon, rising early, had sacrificed with reference to an excursion, and in the first victim the omens were favour­ able.
Just as the sacrifice came to a conclusion, Arexion of Parrhasia, the augur, saw a lucky eagle, and encouraged Xe­ nophon to lead forth.
3. The men, therefore, crossing the trench, ranged themselves under arms;
and the heralds made proclamation that the soldiers, after taking their dinner, should march out equipped for battle, and leave the camp-followers and slaves where they were.
4. All the rest accordingly went out, except Neon ;
for it was thought best to leave him in guard of the people in the camp.
But when the captain?
and soldiers had left them, they were ashamed not to follow where the others went, and in consequence left only those who were above forty-five years of age;
these therefore remained, and the rest went forth.
a.
But before they had proceeded fifteen stadia, they began to meet with dead bodies, and bring­ ing up the rear of their line opposite the corpses that were first seen, they buried all to which the line extended.
6. When they had interred this first set, they marched on, and again bringing up their rear against the first of those that they next found unburied, they buried in like manner as many as the line took in.
When they came to the road that led to the villages, where the dead bodies lay in great numbers, they brought them all together and buried them.
7.
It was now past mid-day, and having marched quite through2 the villages, the men were engaged in taking what­ ever provisions they found within reach of the line, when, on a sudden, they caught sight of the enemy marching over some hills that were facing them, disposed in a line, consisting of a large number of both cavalry and infantry;
for Spithri- dates and Rathines had now arrived with a considerable force from Pharnabazus.
8. As soon as the enemy perceived the Greeks, they halted at the distance of about fifteen stadia.
Upon this Arexion, the angur of the Greeks, immediately offered sacrifice, and in the very first victim the omens were favourable.
9. Xenophon then said, " It appears to me, fel­ low-captains, that we ought to station some divisions on the watch behind the main body, in order that, if it should any­ where be necessary, there may be troops to support that body, and that the enemy, when thrown into disorder, may be re­ ceived by men in array and full vigour."
This proposal was approved by all.
10. Advance then," he continued, "on the road towards the enemy, that, since we have been seen by them, and have seen them, we may not stand still;
and I, after having arranged the divisions in the rear, as you have sanctioned, will join you."11.
The others then advanced quietly forward, and Xeno­ phon, detaching from the main body the three hindmost com­ panies, consisting of about two hundred men each, ordered one of them to follow on the right, at the distance of about a hundred feet behind;
this company Samolas the Achæan commanded.
The second he directed to follow in the centre ;
this company Pyrrhias the Arcadian headed.
The other he stationed on the left;
this Phrasias the Athenian led.
12. As the front line, in marching on, came to a woody ravine, of great extent and difficult to pass, they halted, not knowing whether it were possible to cross it, and passed the word for the generals and captains to come to the front.
13. Xeno­ phon, wondering what it was that stopped their progress, but soon hearing the word passed, rode up as fast as he could.
When the officers came together, Sophænetus, the oldest of the generals, said that it was not worth consideration
I whether a ravine of such a nature were passable or not.
14. But Xe­ nophon, eagerly seizing an opportunity to speak, said," You are certain, my fellow-soldiers, that I have never voluntarily brought danger upon you, for I see that you do not want reputation for valour, but safety.
is.
But now the matter stands thus with us :
it is not possible for us to move from hence without fighting ;
for if we do not advance upon the enemy, the enemy will pursue and attack us when we retreat.
16. Consider, then, whether it is better for us to proceed against the foe holding out our arms in front of us, or, when we have turned them back, to find the enemy following be­ hind us.
it.
You know, assuredly, that to flee from an enemy has no semblance of honour, but that pursuit puts courage even into cowards.
For my own part, I had rather pursue with half the number of men than retreat with twice as many.
As for these enemies, I know that you yourselves do not ex­ pect them to make a stand against us, if we charge them ;
but we are all aware that if we draw back they will have courage enough to follow us.is. "
But that we, by crossing, should place a difficult ravine in our rear, when we are going to engage, is not this an ad­ vantage worth securing ?
As for the enemy, I should wish every spot of ground to appear passable to them, so that they may retreat;
but it is for us to be instructed by the nature of our position that there is no safety for us unless we conquer.
19. I wonder, too, whether any of us thinks this ravine more formidable than many other places that we have passed."
How, indeed, will the plain be passable, unless we defeat the cavalry ?
How will the hills that we have traversed be passable, if so many peltasts pursue us ?
20.
Even if we ar­ rive safe at the sea, how large a ravine will the Euxine prove to us, where there are neither vessels to convey us away, nor provisions to support us if we remain;
and the more haste we should make thither, the more haste must we make to go out again to find subsistence.
21. It is better therefore for us to fight now, when we have dined, than to-morrow, when we may be without a dinner.
The sacrifices,' soldiers, are favour­ able, the omens encouraging, the victims most auspicious.
Let us march against the foe.
Since they have certainly seen us, they ought not now to sup at their ease, or to encamp where they like."22. The captains then bade him lead on, and no one made any objection.
He accordingly put himself at their head.
ordering each to cross at that part of the ravine where be happened to be;
for he thought that the army would thus sooner get over the ravine in a body than if they defiled over the bridge1 that lay across it.
23. When they had passed over, he said, as he passed along the line.
"Remember, soldiers, how many battles, with the assistance of the gods, you have gained by coming to close quarters with the enemy, and how those fare who turn their backs upon their adversaries.
Reflect also that you are at the very gates of Greece.2 24. Follow, then, Hercules your Conductor,3 and exhort one another by name.
4
It is pleasing to reflect, that he who now says and does anything brave and honourable, will preserve a remembrance of himself among those with whom he would wish to preserve it."25.
These exhortations he uttered as he rode along, and at the same time proceeded to lead forward the troops in column ;
and with the peltasts on each flank, they marched upon the enemy.
He gave orders that they should carry their spears upon the right shoulder until a signal should be given with the trumpet, and that then, lowering them for a charge, they should follow their leaders at a steady pace, and that none should advance running.
The word was immediately after given, JUPITER THE PRESERVER AND HERCULES THE CONDUCTOR.
The enemy, meanwhile, kept their position, thinking that they had the ground in their favour.
26. As the Greeks approached them, the peltasts shouted, and ran forward to charge them before any one gave orders;
and the enemy rushed to meet them, both the horse and the mass of Bithynians, and put them to flight.
27. But when the body of heavy-armed men came up, advancing at a quick pace, and when the trumpet sounded, and the men sang the paean and shouted, and lowered their spears, the enemy then no longer awaited their charge.
but took to flight.
28. Timasion and the cavalry pursued them, and killed as many as they could, being but few.
The enemy's left wing, to which the Greek cavalry were opposed, was at once dispersed, but the right, not being closely pursued, rallied upon a hill.
29. As soon as the Greeks, however, saw them making a stand, it appeared to them the easiest and safest thing they could do, to charge them without delay.
Singing the pæan, therefore, they immediately advanced upon them;
and the enemy withdrew.
The peltasts then pursued them till the right wing was also dispersed;
but only a small number were killed;
for the enemy's cavalry, being numerous, kept the Greeks in awe.
so.
But when they observed the cavalry of Pharnabazus still standing in a body, and the Bithynian cavalry flocking to join them, and looking down from an eminence on what was going on, they determined, tired as they were, to make an assault upon them as vigor­ ously as possible, that they might not take breath and re­ cover their courage.
31. Drawing up in close order, there­ fore, they advanced;
when the enemy's horse fled down the hill as if they had been pursued by cavalry;
for there was a valley to receive them, of which the Greeks were not aware, as they had desisted from the pursuit before they reached it, it being now late.
32. Returning then to the place where the first encounter occurred, they erected a trophy, and went off towards the sea about sunset.
The distance to their.
camp was about sixty stadia.
The Greeks plunder Bithyma.
Oleander, the Spartan governor of Byzan­ tium, arrives, and is prejudiced against the Greeks by Dexippus, but re­ conciled to them by the efforts of Xenophon.
Oleander declines the chief command, which is offered him, and the army march under their former generals through Bithynia to Chrysopolis.1.
THE enemy now employed themselves about their cwn affairs, and removed their families and effects as far off as they could.
The Greeks, in the mean time, waited for Oleander and the galleys and transport vessels that were to come, and, going out every day with their baggage-cattle and slaves, brought in, without fear of danger, wheat, barley, wine, legu­ minous vegetables, millet, and figs ;
for the country afforded every useful production except olives.
2.
While the army lay at rest in the camp, the men had liberty, individually, to go out for spoil, and those only who went out had a share of it;
but when the whole army went out, and any one, straggling from the rest, took any booty, it was adjudged to be public property.
3.
They had now abundance of everything ;
for provisions for sale were brought from the Greek cities in every direction, and people who were sailing along the coast, hearing that a city was going to be built, and a harbour formed, willingly put in there.
4. Such of the enemy, too, as lived in the neighbourhood, sent to Xenophon, hearing that he had the management of the intended settlement, to ask what they should do in order to become his friends ;
and he introduced them among the soldiers.'5.
Oleander now arrived with two galleys, but no transport vessel.
At the time of his coming, it happened that the body of the army was gone out;
while some stragglers, going over the mountain for plunder, some one way, some another, hail taken a great number of sheep, and being afraid that they would be taken from them,2 informed Dexippus of the matter, (the same that had run away with the fifty-oared galley from Trebisond,) and requested him to keep the sheep for them, tak­ ing part for himself, and giving them back the rest.
6. Dexippus immediately drove off the soldiers3 that stood round, and who said that the sheep were public property, and, going to Cle­ ander, told him that they were endeavouring to seize them as plunder for themselves.
Oleander desired him to bring who­ ever should seize them before him.
7. Dexippus accordingly laid hold on one of the men, and was taking him off, when Agasias, meeting him, rescued the man ;
the prisoner being a private of his own troop.
The rest of the soldiers that were there began to throw stones at Dexippus, calling him again and again, “the traitor."
Not only he, in consequence, but also many of the men belonging to his galleys, were struck with terror, and fled towards the sea;
and Oleander fled like­ wise.
8. But Xenophon, and the other generals, endeavoured to stop their flight, and told Oleander that there was no reason for alarm,4 but that the resolution passed by the army was the cause of the occurrence.
9. Oleander, however, being instigated by Dexippus, and vexed with himself for having shown so much fear, said that he would sail off, and make proclamation that none of the cities should receive them, as being public enemies.
The Lacedæmonians were at that time masters of all Greece.10.
This affair appeared to the Greeks to threaten evil, and they entreated Cleander not to do so ;
but he said that it could not be otherwise, unless somebody should give up to him the man that began to throw stones, and the person that rescued him.
11. The person that he wanted was Agasias, the con­ stant friend of Xenophon, for which reason Dexippus had ac­ cused him.
As there was much perplexity, therefore, the generals called together the soldiers;
and some of them made light of Cleander's menaces, but to Xenophon the affair ap­ peared of no small importance.
Rising up, he said,12.
“It seems to me, soldiers, a matter of no trifling mo­ ment, if Cleander goes away, as he threatens, cherishing these feelings towards us;
for the Greek cities are close at hand, the Lacedæmonians are the chief people of Greece, and each individual Lacedæmonian is able to do what he pleases in these cities.
13. If therefore he first shuts us out of Byzan­ tium, and then gives notice to the other governors not to ad­ mit us into their cities, as persons refusing obedience to the Lacedæmonians and submitting to no law, and this character of us reaches the ears of Anaxibius the admiral, it will be difficult for us either to remain or to sail away, for at this moment the Lacedæmonians are masters both by land and sea.
14. We ought not, therefore, for the sake of one or two men, to exc'ude ourselves from Greece, but to do whatever they direct;
for the cities, from which we come, yield them obedi­ ence.
is.
1, for my own part, (for I hear that Dexippus assures Cleander that Agasias would have done nothing in the matter, if I had not instigated him,) for my part, I say, I am ready to clear you ai.d Agasias from blame, if Aga­ sias himself shall say that I was at all the cause of these proceedings, and I am prepared to condemn myself, if I en­ couraged stone-throwing or any other act of violence, as deserv­ ing of the severest punishment, and that punishment I will submit to suffer.
16. I say, too, that if Dexippus accuses any other person, he ought to surrender himself to Oleander to be tried;
for by this means you may be exonerated from all cen­ sure.
Under the present complexion of the case, it will be hard, if, when we expeet applause and honour in Greece, we shall, instead of obtaining them, be not even on an equality with the rest of our countrymen, but be excluded from the Greek cities."17.
Agasias then stood up and said, "I swear, my fellow- soldiers, by all the gods and goddesses, that neither Xenophon, nor any other person among you, desired me to rescue the man ;
but, when I saw a brave fellow, one of my own troop, led off by Dexippus, (who, you are aware, has played the traitor towards you,) it seemed to me, I own, intolerable, and I set him free.
is.
You need not, then, deliver me up, for I will surrender myself, as Xenophon recommends, to Cleander, to do to me, after having tried me, whatever he pleases.
As far as this matter is concerned, enter into no contention with the Lacedæmonians.
May each of you return in safety to whatever place he would reach!
Make choice, however, of some of your own number, and send them with me to Clean­ der, that, if I omit anything, they may speak and act for me."
19. Upon this the army allowed him to choose whomsoever he would, and to go.
He chose the generals.
Agasias and the generals, and the man that had been re­ leased by Agasias, accordingly proceeded to Cleander ;
and the generals said, 20.
“The army has sent us to you, 0 Oleander, and requests that if you accuse them all, you will yourself be the judge or them all, and treat them as you may think fit;
or, if you accuse one or two or more, they think it right that they should surrender themselves to you for judg­ ment.
If therefore you accuse any one of us, we are here before you ;
if any other, let us know;
for no man, who is willing to obey us, shall refuse to submit to yon."21. Agasias next stood forward, and said, " I am the per­ son, 0 Oleander, that rescued this man when Dexippus was carrying him off, and that incited the men to stone Dexippus ;
22.
for I knew that the soldier was a deserving man, and I knew also that Dexippus, after having been chosen by the army to command the galley which we begged of the people of Trebisond for the purpose cf collecting transport vessels to save ourselves, had run away and betrayed the soldiers in common with whom lie had preserved his life.
23. Through his misconduct, therefore, we have both deprived the people of Trebisond of their galley, and seem to have acted dishon­ estly;
and, as far as depended upon him, we were utterly un­ done;
for he had heard, as well as we, that it would be im­ practicable for us, going by land, to cross the rivers and get safe to Greece.
24. It was from such a character as this that I rescued the man.
If you had been leading him away, or any one of those belonging to you, and not one of our own deserters, be assured that I should have done nothing of the kind.
Consider, then, that if you put me to death, you will put to death a man of honour for the sake of a coward and a villain.”25.
Cleander, on hearing this statement, said that he could not approve of the conduct of Dexippus, if he had acted in such a way, but observed, at the same time, that even if Dex­ ippus were the worst of villains, he ought not to suffer any violence, but to be tried, ("as you yourselves," said he, "now propose,") and to have his deserts.
26. " For the present then," he continued, "retire, leaving Agasias with me, and, when I give you notice, come to witness his trial.
I neither accuse the army, nor any one else, since Agasias himself con­ fesses that it was he who released the man."
27. The man who had been released then said, “If you suppose, 0 Clean­ der, that I was apprehended for doing something wrong, be assured that I neither struck nor threw stones at any one, but merely said that the sheep were public property;
for it was a resolution passed by the soldiers, that if, when the whole army went out, any particular person made any capture by himself, that capture should go to the public store.
28. This was what I said ;
and Dexippus, in consequence, seized me and was lead­ ing me off, so that no one might utter a syllable,' but that ho himself, securing a share of the booty, might keep the rest for the plunderers, contrary to the resolution of the army."
To this Oleander replied, “Since you are that sort of person, stay here, that we may consider respecting you likewise."29.
Cleander and his party then went to dinner;
and Xe nophon assembled the troops, and advised them to send some persons to Cleander to make intercession for the men.
30. They accordingly resolved to depute the generals and captains, with Dracontius1 the Spartan, and such of the rest as seemed eligible, to entreat Oleander by all means to set the two men free.
31. Xenophon, going to him, said, “You have the men in your hands, 0 Oleander, and the army has allowed you to do what you please with regard both to them and to their whole force.
They now, however, request and entreat of you to give up the two men to them, and not to put them to death ;
for they exerted themselves greatly, in time past, to be of service to the army.
32. Should they obtain this favour from you, they promise you, in return for it, that if you are willing to be their leader, and the gods are propitious, they will let you see both how well-disciplined they are, and how incapable, when obedient to their general, and aided by superior powers, of fearing an enemy.
33. They also beg of you, that when you have come and taken the command of them, you will make trial of Dexippus and the rest of them, ascertain what sort of person each is, and give every one his desert."34. Oleander, on hearing this application, replied, “By the twin gods,2 I will give you an answer at once.
I give up the men to you, and will come to you myself;
and, if the gods permit, I will lead you into Greece.
Your words are very different from the accounts that I heard of some of you, namely, that you were alienating the army from the Lacedæ­ monians."
35. The deputies then took their leave, applaud­ ing Oleander, and taking with them the two men.
Oleander offered a sacrifice with reference to the journey, and associated in a friendly way with Xenophon ;
and they contracted a bond of hospitality between them.
When he saw the Greek soldiers, too, execute their orders with regu­ larity, he grew still more desirous to become their commander.
36. But as the omens were not favourable to his wishes, though he offered sacrifices three days, he called the generals together, and said, "The victims have not been favourable for me to lead you out;
but be not discouraged on that account;
for it is given to you, as it appears, to conduct the army home.
Proceed then;
and we will receive you at Byzantium when you arrive there,1 in the best manner that we can."
37. It was then resolved by the soldiers to make him a present of the sheep that were public property ;
and he, having accepted them, gave them back to the soldiers again, and then sailed off.
The army, having disposed of the corn which they had col­ lected, and the other booty that they had captured, advanced through the territory of the Bithynians.
38. But as, while they pursued the straight road, they met with nothing to enable them to enter the country of their friends with a portion of spoil, they resolved upon marching back for a day and a night;
and, having done so, they took great numbers both of slaves and cattle, and arrived, after six days' march, at Chrysopolis in Chalcedonia, where they stayed seven days to sell their booty.
Anaxibius, at the instigation of Pharnabazus, who wishes to get the Greeks out of his territory, allures them, with hopes of employment and pay, to Byzantium.
They accordingly appear in arms before the city, but find­ ing the gates shut against them, force an entrance, and are with great difficulty pacified by Xenophon.
Cœratades, a Theban, offers to lead them into Thrace, and his proposal is accepted;
but he soon shows his incapacity, and lays down the command.
1.
WHAT the Greeks did in their march up the country with Cyrus, until the battle was fought, what they ex­ perienced in their retreat, after Cyrus was dead, till they reached the Euxine Sea, and how they fared, in their pro­ gress by sea and land, from the time that they arrived at the Euxine until they got beyond the mouth of it to Chrysopolis in Asia, has been related in the preceding part of the nar­ rative.a.
Pharnabazus, fearing that the army of the Greeks might make an irruption into his province, sent to Anaxibius the Spartan admiral, who was at Byzantium, and begged him to transport the army out of Asia, promising to do for him in re­ turn whatever he might require of him.
3. Anaxibius, ac­ cordingly, sent for the generals and captains of the troops to Byzantium, engaging that if they came over to him, pay should be given to the men.
4. The rest of the officers said that they would give him an answer after they had considered of the matter ;
but Xenophon told him that he was going to leave the army, and wanted to sail away.
Anaxibius, however, requested him to come across with the rest, and then to take his departure.
Xenophon therefore said that he would do so.5.
In the mean time Seuthes1 the Thracian sent Medosades to Xenophon, requesting that general to join with him in using his efforts that the army might cross over, and saying that he should have no cause to repent of assisting him in that object.
6. Xenophon replied, " The army will doubtless cross over ;
let him give nothing to me therefore, or to any one else, on that account.
When it has crossed, I shall quit it;
so let him address himself to those who stay, and who may seem able to serve him, in such a manner as may appear likely to be successful.
"7. Soon after, the whole army of the Greeks crossed over to Byzantium.
Anaxibius however gave them no pay, but made proclamation that the soldiers should take their arms and baggage, and go out of the city, signifying that he intended at once to send them away home, and to take their number.
The soldiers were in consequence greatly troubled, because they had no money to get provisions for their journey, and packed up their baggage with reluctance.
8.
Xenophon, who had become a guest-friend to Cleander the governor, went to take leave of him, with the intention of sailing away immediately.
But Cleander said to him, "By no means do so, for, if you do, you will incur blame, since some people, indeed, already accuse you as the cause that the army proceeds out1 so slowly.”
9. Xenophon replied, "I am not the cause of this, but the soldiers, being in want of pro­ visions, are for that reason, of themselves, reluctant to go out."
10. "However I advise you," rejoined Cleander, " to go out with them, as if you intended to accompany them, and when the army is clear of the city, then to quit it."
“We will then go to Anaxibius," said Xenophon, "and further the pro­ ceedings.”
They accordingly went, and told him that such was their intention.
11. He recommended that they should act in conformity with what they said, and that the troops should go out as soon as possible with their baggage packed up;
de­ siring them to give notice, at the same time, that whoever should not be present at the review and numbering of the army, would have himself to blame.
12. The generals then went out first, and the rest of the army followed them.
They were now all out except a few, and Eteonicus2 was standing by the gates, really to shut them, and thrust in the bar, as soon as they were all outside, 13.
when Anaxibius, summoning the generals and captains, said, " You may take provisions from the Thracian villages;
for there is plenty of barley and wheat, and other necessaries, in them ;
and when you have supplied yourselves, proceed to the Chersonesus, and there Cyniscus3 Will give you pay.”
14. Some of the sol­ diers that overheard this, or some one of the captains, com­ municated it to the army.
The generals, meanwhile, in­ quired about Seuthes, whether he would prove hostile or friendly, and whether they must march over the Sacred Mountain,4 or round about through the middle of Thrace.
is.
But while they were talking of these matters, the soldiers, snatching up their arms, ran in haste to the gates, with a de­ sign to make their way back within the walls.
Eteonicus, however, and those about him, when they saw the heavy- armed men running towards them, shut the gates, and thrust in the bar.
16. The soldiers then knocked at the gates, and said that they were treated most unjustly, in being shut out as a prey to the enemy, and declared that they would split the gates asunder, if the people did not open them of their own accord.
17. Some ran off to the sea, and got over into the city by the pier of the wall;
while others of them, who hap­ pened to be still in the town, when they perceived what was passing at the gates, cut the bars in twain with their axes, and set the gates wide open.
They then all rushed in.is.
Xenophon, observing what was going on, and fearing lest the army should fall to plundering, and irreparable mis­ chief be done, not only to the city, but to himself and the men, ran and got within the gates along with the crowd.
19. The people of Byzantium, at the same time, when they saw the army entering by force, fled from the market-place, some to the ships, and some to their houses, while others, who hap­ pened to be within-doors, ran out;
some hauled down the galleys into the water, that they might save themselves in them ;
and all believed themselves ruined, regarding the city as captured.
20. Eteonicus fled to the citadel.
Anaxibius, running down to the sea, sailed round to the same place in a fishing-boat, and immediately sent for men from the garrison at Chalcedon ;
for those in the citadel did not appear sufficient to repel the Greeks.
2t.
The soldiers, as soon as they saw Xenophon, ran up to him in great numbers, and cried, “You have now an oppor­ tunity, 0 Xenophon, to become a great man.
You are in possession of a city, you have galleys, you have money, you have this large number of men.
Now, therefore, if you are inclined, you may benefit us, and we may make you a distin­ guished man."
22. Xenophon replied, “You say well, and I will act accordingly ;
but if you aim at this object, range your­ selves under arms as quickly as possible," for he wished to quiet them, and not only gave these orders himself, but desired the other officers also to command the men to range themselves under arms.
23. As the men, too, began to marshal them­ selves, the heavy-armed troops soon formed eight deep, and the peltasts ran to take their station on each wing.
24. The ground, which was called the Thracian Area,' was excellent for the arrangement of troops, being clear of houses, and level.
When the arms were in their places,2 and the men somewhat tranquillized, Xenophon called the soldiers round him, and spoke as follows :
25.
“That you are angry, soldiers, and think you have been treated strangely in being deceived, I am not at all sur­ prised ;
but if we gratify our resentment, and not only take revenge on the Lacedæmonians, who are here, for their impo­ sition, but plunder the city which is not at all to blame, con­ sider what will be the consequences ;
26.
we shall be tho declared enemies both of the Lacedæmonians and their allies.
What will be the nature of a war with them, we may conjec­ ture, as we have seen and remember what has recently occur­ red.
27. We Athenians entered upon the contest with the Lacedæmonians and their allies, with not less than three hun­ dred3 galleys, some at sea and some in the docks, with a great sum of money in the Acropolis,4 and with a yearly revenue, from our customs at home and our territory abroad, of not less than a thousand talents;
but though we were masters of all the islands, were possessed of many cities in Asia, and many others in Europe, and of this very Byzantium where we now are, yet we were reduced in the war to such a condition as you all know.
28. And what may we now expect to be our fate, when the Lacedæmonians and Achæans are in alliance;
when the Athenians, and those who were then allied with them, have become an accession to the Spartan power;
when Tissaphernes, and all the other Barbarians on the sea-coast, are our enemies, and the king of Persia himself our greatest enemy, whom wc went to despoil of his throne, and, if we could, to deprive of life ?
When all these opponents are united against us, is there anybody so senseless as to think that we could get the superiority ?
29.
Let us not, in the name of the gods, act like madmen, and perish with disgrace, by becoming enemies to our country, and to our own friends and relations !
For our connexions are all in the cities that will make war upon us, and that will make war justly indeed, if, when wo declined to possess ourselves of any Barbarian city, though we were superior in force, we should plunder the first Greek city at which we have arrived.
so.
For my own part, I pray that, before I see such an atrocity committed by you, I may be buried ten thousand fathoms under ground.
I advise you, as you are Greeks, to endeavour to obtain justice by submit­ ting to those who are masters of the Greeks.
Should you be unable to obtain it, however, we ought not, though wronged, to deprive ourselves of all hope of returning to Greece.
31. It appears to me, therefore, that we should now send deputies to Anaxibius, with this message:
‛We came into the city with no design to commit violence, but, if we could, to obtain some service from you;
but, if we obtain none, we intend to show that we shall go out of it, not because we have been de­ ceived, but because we are willing to obey you.'"32.
This proposal met with approbation ;
and they de­ spatched Ilieronymus the Elean, Eurylochus the Arcadian, and Philesius the Achæan, to carry the message.
They ac­ cordingly proceeded to deliver it.
33.
But while the soldiers were still seated, Cœratades,1 a, Theban, came up to them ;
a man who was going about the country, not banished from Greece, but wanting to be a general, and offering his services wherever any city or people required a leader;
and, as he came forward, he said that he was prepared to conduct them to that part of Thrace called the Delta, where they would find plenty of good things, and that, till they should arrive there, he would supply them with meat and drink in abundance.
34. The soldiers listened to this offer, and heard, at the same time, the reply brought from Anaxibius, for he had sent an answer that " if they complied with his wishes, they should have no cause to repent;
and that he would report their conduct to the authorities at Sparta, and would contrive to do for them whatever service he could."
35. The soldiers, in consequence, took Cœratades as their leader, and went out of the city, Cœratades engaging to come to the army next day with victims for sacrifice, an augur, and meat and drink for the troops.
36. As soon as they were gone out, Anaxibius caused the gates to be shut, and proclamation made, that whoever of the soldiers should be found within, should be sold as a slave.
37. Next day Cœratades came with the victims and the augur;
and twenty men followed him carrying barley-meal, and other twenty carrying wine;
three also with as large a load as they could bear of olives ;
one with as much as he could carry of garlic, and another of onions.
Having ordered these things to be laid down, as if for distribution, he proceeded to offer sacrifice.
38. Xenophon, meanwhile, having sent for Cleander, urged him to obtain permission for him to enter the walls, and to sail away from Byzantium.
39. When Cleander arrived, he said, “ I am come, after having obtained the permission with extreme difficulty;
for Anaxibius says that it is not proper for the soldiers to be close to the walls, and Xenophon with­ in ;
and that the Byzantines are split into factions, and at enmity one with another;
yet he has desired you," he added, "to enter, if you intend 1 to sail with him.” 40. Xenophon accordingly took leave of the soldiers, and went into the city with Cleander.
Cœratades, the first day, had no favourable omens from the sacrifice, and distributed nothing among the troops.
The next day the victims were placed at the altar, and Cœratades took his station with a chaplet on his head, as if intending to offer sacrifice;
when Timasion the Dardaniam, Neon the Asinæan, and Cleanor the Orchomenian, came forward and told Cœratades not to sacrifice, as he should not lead the army, unless he supplied it with provisions.
41. He then or­ dered a distribution to be made.
But as his supply fell far short of one day's subsistence for each of the soldiers, he went off, taking with turn the victims, and renouncing the general­ ship.
The generals disagreeing about the route, many of the soldiers desert.
Anaxibius and Xenophon, on their voyage, are met at Cyzicus by Aristar­ chus, Cleander's successor ;
he sells four hundred of the Greeks for slaves.
Xenophon returns to the army, and the Greeks, on his advice, agree to sail back to Asia, but are hindered by Aristarchus.
Their services are solicited by Seuthes, and Xenophon goes to learn his terms.
I. BUT Neon the Asinæan, Phryniscus,1 Philesius, Xanthi­ cles, all Achæans, and Timasion the Dardanian, remained in command of the army, and marching forward to some villages of the Thracians, over against Byzantium, encamped there.
a.
The generals had now some disagreement, Cleanor and Phryniscus wishing to lead the army to Seuthes, (for he had gained them over to his interest, having presented a horse to the one, and a mistress to the other,) and Neon desiring to take it to the Chersonesus, as he thought that if they came into the dominions of the Lacedæmonians, he himself would get the command of the whole army.
Timasion, however, wanted to cross over again into Asia, expecting by this means to effect his return home.
3. The army were of the samo mind;
but, while time was wasted in the discussion, many of the soldiers deserted ;
some, selling their arms up and down the country, sailed away as they could;
others joined2 tho people in the neighbouring towns.
4. Anaxibius was pleased to hear these accounts of the dispersion of the army;
for he thought that by such a state of things he should most gratify Pharnabazus.a.
As Anaxibius was on his voyage from Byzantium, Aris­ tarehus, the successor of Oleander as governor of Byzantium, met him at Cyzicus, and said that Polus, the successor of Anax­ ibius as admiral, was on the point of entering the Hellespont.
6. Anaxibius desired Aristarchus to sell all the soldiers of Cyrus, whom he should find remaining in Byzantium, as slaves.
As for Oleander, he had sold none, but had even at­ tended, from compassion, to such as were sick, and obliged the inhabitants to receive them into their houses;
but Aris­ tarchus, as soon as he arrived, sold not less than four hundred.
7.
Anaxibius, when he had sailed along the coast as far as Parium, sent to Pharnabazus according to an agreement be­ tween them.
But Pharnabazus, when he found that Aris­ tarchus was going as governor to Byzantium, and that Anax­ ibius was no longer admiral, neglected Anaxibius, and entered into a negotiation with Aristarchus about the army of Cyrus, similar to that which lie had previously made with Anaxibius.
8.
Soon after, Anaxibius called Xenophon to him, and urged him, by every means and contrivance, to sail back to the army as soon as possible, to keep it together, to collect as many of the dispersed soldiers as he could, and then, leading them along the coast to Perinthus, to transport them without delay into Asia.
He gave him, at the same time, a thirty- oared galley and a letter, and sent a man with him to tell the people of Perinthus to despatch Xenophon on horseback to the army as soon as possible.
9. Xenophon then sailed across, 1 and arrived at the army.
The soldiers gladly welcomed him, and followed him at once with cheerfulness, in expectation of passing over from Thrace into Asia.10.
Seuthes, when he heard of his return, sent Medosades to him by sea, and begged him to bring the army to him.
promising him whatever he thought likely to prevail on him Xenophon told him in reply that nothing of the kind was pos­ sible;
it and Medosades, on receiving this answer, went away.
When the Greeks came to Perinthus, Neon, drawing off from the rest, encamped apart with about eight hundred men.
All the other troops remained together under the walls of Perinthus.
12.
Xenophon was next engaged in getting vessels, in order that they might cross over to Asia as soon as possible.
But just at this time Aristarchus the governor, instigated by Pharnabazus, came with two galleys from Byzantium, and forbade the masters of the ships to carry over the Greeks, and then, going to the army, desired the soldiers not to go across into Asia.
13. Xenophon told him that Anaxibius had or­ dered them to go, “ and sent me hither,”added he, " with that view." “ Anaxibius," retorted Aristarchus, “ is no longer admiral, and I am governor here ;
and if I find one of you on the sea, I will drown him."
Having said this, he went off into the town.
14. Next day he sent for the generals and captains of the army;
but, as they came up to the wall, somebody gave notice to Xenophon, that if he went in, he would be apprehended, and either suffer some injury there, or be delivered to Phar­ nabazus.
Hearing this, he sent the others on before, and said that he himself had a mind to offer sacrifice.
is.
Returning, accordingly, he sacrificed to know whether the gods would permit him to attempt to lead the army to Seuthes, for he saw that it was not safe to cross over into Asia, as he who would hinder him had galleys at his command, nor was he willing to go to the Chersonesus and be shut up there, or that the army should be in great want of everything in a place where it would be necessary to obey the governor, and where the troops would be able to procure no supplies.
16.
He was engaged about this matter, when the generals and captains returned from Aristarchus, and brought word that he had told them to go away for the present, and to come back to him in the evening.
Hence his treacherous intentions became still more manifest.
17. Xenophon, therefore, as the sacrifices seemed favourable for himself and the army to go in security to Seuthes, took with him Polycrates the Athenian, one of the captains, and from each of the generals, except Neon, a person in whom they confided, and went in the night to the camp of Seuthes, a distance of sixty stadia.
is.
As lie drew near it, lie met with several watch-fires without guards, and thought that Seuthes had decamped;
but, hearing a noise, and the men about Seuthes making signals to one another, he understood that these fires had been kindled by Seuthes in front of the night-posts, in order that the sentinels, being in the dark, might not be seen, or show how many or where they were, while those who approached might not be concealed, but be conspicuous in the light.
19. When he found that such was the case, he sent the interpreter whom he had with him, and told him to let Seuthes know that Xeno­ phon was there, and desired a conference with him.
They inquired if it was Xenophon the Athenian, from the Grecian army, 20.
As he answered that it was he, they leaped upon their horses, and hastened off.
A little after, about two hun­ dred peltasts appeared, and conducted Xenophon and his party to Seuthes.
21.
Seuthes was in a tower, strictly guarded, and round it stood horses ready bridled;
for, through fear, he fed his horses during the day, and kept on guard with them bridled during the night.
22. For Teres, one of his ancestors, when he had once a large army in this country, was said to have lost great numbers of his men, and to have been stripped of his baggage by the natives, who are called Thynians, and are said to be the most formidable of all enemies, especially in the night.
23.
When they approached, Seuthes gave notice that Xeno­ phon, with any two of his attendants that he chose, might enter.
As soon as they went in, they first saluted one another, and, according to the Thracian custom, drank to each other in horns full of wine ;
Medosades, who acted as tho ambassador of Seuthes on all occasions, being present with him.
24. Xenophon then began to speak as follows. “ You sent Medosades, who is present here, to me, 0 Scuthes, for the first time at Chalcedon, requesting me to join my efforts to yours that the army might cross over out of Asia, and, promising, as Medosades here said, that if I succeeded, vou would do me some service in return."
25. When he had said this, he asked Medosades if it was true ;
and he said that it was. “
When I had gone over again to the army from Pari­ um, Medosades came to me a second time, assuring me, that if I would bring the army to you, you would not only treat me as a friend and a brother in other respects, but that the towns also along the sea, of which you are master, would be assigned to me from you."
26. He then again asked Medosades whether he said this, and Medosades acknowledged it.
“ Well then," said Xenophon, "tell Seuthes what answer I gave you, on the first occasion, at Chalcedon."
27. " You answered that the army was going to cross over to Byzantium, and that there would therefore be no occasion oil that account to give anything either to you or to any other person ;
you added that, as soon as you had crossed, you would quit the army ;
and all took place as you said."
28. " And what did I say," con­ tinued Xenophon, "when you came to Selybria ?”1 "You said that what I proposed was impracticable, but that the army was to go to Perinthus, and pass over into Asia."
29. “ Well then,” said Xenophon, " I am now present before you, with Phryniscus here, one of the generals, and Polycrates, one of the captains;
and, without, arc deputies from the other generals, the most confidential friends of each, except from Neon the Lacedæmonian.
so.
If you wish the business to have greater sanction, call them in also;
and do you, Poly­ crates, go and tell them that I desire them to leave their arms outside ;
and do you leave your sword there, and come in again.
"31. Seuthes, on hearing this, said that he would distrust no one of the Athenians, for he knew that they were connected with him by lineage,2 and regarded them as kind friends.
Afterwards, when those who were wanted had come in, Xe­ nophon first asked Seuthes what use he proposed to make of the army.
32. Seuthes then proceeded to speak thus:
"Mæ sades was my father;
and under his government were the Melanditæ, the Thynians, and the Tranipsæ.
But when the power of the Odrysæ declined, my father, being driven from this country, died of a disease, and I, being left an orphan, was bred up with Medocus, the present king.
33. As soon as I became a young man, however, I could not bear to sub­ sist in dependence upon another person's table;
and I sat on my seat' before him as a suppliant that he would give me as many troops as he could, in order that, if I found it at all in my power, I might inflict some evil on those who had expelled us, and might cease to live by looking, like a dog, to his table.
34. In compliance with my request he gave me the infantry and cavalry which you will see as soon as it is day.
I now subsist with the aid of these troops, making depredations on my own hereditary dominions ;
and if you join me, I should expect, with the assistance of the gods, to recover my authority with ease.
This is what I desire of you."35. "If we should come, then," said Xenophon, "what would you be able to give to the soldiers, captains, and generals ?
Let me know, that these who are with me may carry word to them."
36. Seuthes then promised to give every soldier a Cyzicene stater,2 twice as much to a captain, and four times as much to a general, with as much land as they should desire, yokes of oxen, and a walled town near the sea.
37. But if," said Xenophon, " when we attempt this service, we should not succeed, but something to deter us should arise on the part of the Lacedæmonians, will you, if any of us should wish to take refuge with you, receive them into your country ?"
38. "Xay more," replied he, " I will even treat them as brothers, make them guests at my own table, and sharers of all that we may be able to acquire.
To you, Xenophon, I will give my daughter;
and, if you have a daughter, I will buy1 her ac­ cording to the Thracian custom, and will give you Bisanthe, which is the finest of my towns upon the sea, as a residence.
"All the Greeks, except Neon and his party, accept the proposals of Senthea, and join him.
They march with Seuthes against his enemies, whom they surprise unawares, and take a great number of slaves, and much spoil.
1.
THE party having heard these offers, and having ex­ changed right hands, rode off.
They got back to the camp before day-break, find made each his report to those who sent him.
2. As soon as it was light, Aristarchus sent again for the generals and captains, but they determined to decline going to him, and to call together the army.
All the troops came, except those of Neon, who were about ten stadia dis­ tant.
3. When they were met, Xenophon stood up and spoke as follows :
"
Soldiers !
Aristarchus, having galleys at command, seeks to prevent us sailing whither we desire ;
and in consequence it is not safe for us to embark.
He would have us make our way by force over the Sacred Mountain into the Chersonesus ;
and, if we should succeed in crossing that mountain, and ar­ rive there, lie says that he will not again sell any of you, as he did at Byzantium, or deceive you again, but that you shall receive pay, and that he will no longer suffer you, as at present, to be in want of provisions.
4. Thus speaks Aristarchus.
Seuthes, on the other hand, says that if you go to him, lie will be of service to you.
Consider, therefore, whether you will decide on this point while remaining here now, or after having gone hack to get provisions.
5. My own opinion is, that since we have no money here to purchase, and since they will not allow us to take provisions without money, we should return to the villages where the inhabitants, being weaker than we are, permit us to take them, and that there, when we have got supplies, and heard what each of them desiresof you,1 you may choose whatever may seem best.
6. To whomsoever this proposal is agreeable, let him hold up his hand."
They all held up their hands.
"Go then," continued he, "and prepare your baggage, and when any one gives the signal, follow your leader.
"7. Soon after, Xenophon put himself at their head, and they followed him.
Neon, however, and some other persons sent by Aristarchus, tried to persuade them to turn back ;
but they paid no regard to their words.
When they had advanced about thirty stadia, Seuthes met them ;
and Xenophon, when lie saw him, invited him to ride up, that he might state to him, in the hearing of as many as possible, what he thought for their advantage.
8. As he came forward, Xenophon said, " We are going to some place where the army will be likely to get provisions, and where, after hearing your proposals, and those of the Lacedæmonian, we shall determine upon that course which may seem best to us.
If therefore you will conduct us to a place where provisions are in the greatest abundance, we shall consider ourselves as being your guests."
9. Seuthes replied, " I know of several villages lying close to­ gether, containing all sorts of provisions, and distant from us only so far that you may go over to them and dine in com­ fort."
"Conduet us, then," said Xenophon,10.
When they had reached the villages, in the afternoon, the soldiers assembled, and Seuthes spoke thus:
"I wish you, soldiers, to take service with me, and propose to give each of you a Cyzicene stater' monthly, and the captains and generals what is customary.
In addition to this, I will do honour to every man that proves himself worthy of it.
Meat and drink you shall have, as at present, by taking it from the country;
but whatever spoil may be taken, I shall think proper to keep myself, that, by disposing of it, I may provide pay for you.
11. Such enemies as flee from us, and conceal themselves, we shall be able to pursue and discover;
1 and such as resist us, we shall endeavour, with your assistance, to overcome."
12. Xenophon then inquired, " How far from the sea shall you re­ quire the army to follow you?"
He replied, "Never more than seven days' march, and often less."13. Liberty was then given to any one that wished, to speak;
and many concurred in saying that Seuthes made proposals of the greatest advantage, as it was winter, and no longer practicable, even for such as desired, to sail home;
and as it was impossible for them to iive, though in a country of friends, if they were to subsist by purchasing, while it would be safer for them to remain and find subsistence in an enemy's country jointly with Scuthes than by themselves, so many advantages offering themselves, and if, in addition to these, they also re­ ceived pay, it appeared to them an unexpected piece of good fortune.
14. Xenophon then said, " If any one has aught to say against this opinion, let him speak at once ;
if not, let him vote for it."
As no one said anything against it, he put it to the vote, and the decision was in favour of it.
Xenophon immediately told Seuthes that they would take the field with him.
15. The soldiers then pitched their tents according to their divisions;
the generals and captains Seuthes, who occupied a neighbouring village, invited to supper.
16. When they were at the entrance, going in to supper, a man named Heraclides, a native of Maronea,2 presented himself before them.
This man, addressing himself to every one whom lie thought pos­ sessed of anything to present to Seuthes, and first to certain people from Parium,3 who were come to establish a friendship with Medocus, king of the Odrysæ, and had brought presents for Seuthes and his wife, said that Medocus resided up the country, twelve days'journey from the sea, and that Seuthes, since he had taken this force into his service, would be master on the coast;
17. " being your neighbour therefore," he added.
"lie will be greatly in a condition to do you both good and harm;
and, if you are wise, you will accordingly give him what you have brought, and it will be bestowed to better account than if you were to give it to Medocus, who lives at a distance." is.
By these arguments lie prevailed upon them.
Accosting, in the next place, Timasion the Dardanian, as he had heard that he had cups and Persian carpets, he observed that it was customary, whenever Seuthes invited people to supper, for those who were invited to make him presents;
" and," said he, " if he becomes powerful in this country, he will be able either to restore you to yours, or to make you rich here."
In this manner he sued for Seuthes, addressing himself to each of the guests.
19. Advancing also towards Xenophon, he said, " You are of a most honourable city, and your name stands very high with Seuthes;
and perhaps you will desire to have some place of strength, and a portion of land, in this country, as others1 of your countrymen have.
It will be proper for you, therefore, to honour Seuthes most magnificently;
20.
and I give you this advice as your well- wisher;
for I know that the greater presents you make him,2 the greater benefits you will receive from him."
Xenophon, on hearing this, was in some perplexity ;
for he had come over from Parium with only one servant and just enough money for the journey.
21.
When the company went in to supper, consisting of the chief Thracians who were there, the generals and captains of the Greeks, and such ambassadors as had come from any city, the supper was prepared for them as they took their seats in a circle, and tables with three feet were then brought in for each.
These tables were full of pieces of meat piled up, and large leavened loaves were attached to the meat.
22. The tables3 were always placed near the strangers in preference to others;
for such was their custom.
Seuthes then first pro­ ceeded to act as follows:
taking up the loaves that were set by him, he broke them into small portions, and distributed to those whom he pleased, and the flesh in a similar way, leaving for himself only just sufficient to taste.
23. The rest of those, before whom tables were placed, followed his example.
But a certain Arcadian, whose name was Arystas, an extra­ ordinary eater, took no care about distributing, but taking in his hand a loaf of about three chœnices,1 and placing some meat upon his knees, went on with his supper.
24. In the mean time they carried round horns of wine, and everybody took some;
but Arystas, when the cup-bearer came to him with the horn, and he observed that Xenophon had finished his supper, said, " Give it to him, for he is now at leisure;
I am not so yet."
25. Seuthes, hearing the voice, asked the cup-bearer what he said ;
and the cup-bearer (for he knew the Greek language) told him.
A laugh in consequence followed.
26.
As the cup made its way, a Thracian entered leading a white horse, and, taking up a horn full of wine, said, " I drink to you, 0 Seuthes, and present you with this horse, mounted on which, and pursuing whomsoever you please, you will over­ take him, and, when retreating, you will have no cause to fear an enemy."
27. Another, bringing in a boy, presented him, drinking to Seuthes, in like manner, and another vestments for his wife.
Timasion, drinking to him, made him a present of a silver cup, and a carpet worth ten minæ.
28. But one Gnesippus, an Athenian, rose up and said, that it was an ex­ cellent custom in old times, that those who had anything should give presents to the king to do him honour, and that the king should give to those who have nothing;
I therefore beg something of you,2 that I may have something to present you, and to do you honour."29.
As for Xenophon, he was in doubt how to act, for he was seated, as a person held in honour, in the place next to Seuthes ;
and Heraclides now desired the cup-bearer to pre­ sent him the horn.
However he stood up boldly, (for he had by this time drunk rather copiously,) and, taking the horn, said, so.
"I present you, 0 Seuthes, myself, and these my comrades, to be your faithful friends, no one of them being reluctant, but all desiring, even more than myself, to be your adherents.
31. They are now here before you, asking nothing else of you, hut desiring to labour for you, expressing their willingness to incur dangers for your sake;
with whose as­ sistance, if the gods are favourable, you will recover, on the one hand, a large portion of country which was your father's, and, on the other, acquire some in addition ;
and you will also become master of many men and women, whom it will not be necessary to take by force, but they themselves will come to you with presents in their hands."
32. Seuthes then stood up and drank with him.1 and then joined with him in sprinkling what remained in the horn upon himself.
2Soon after some people came in that played on horns, such as they make signals with, and trumpets made of raw ox-hides.
blowing regular tunes, and as if they were playing on the magadis.
3 33. Seuthes himself rose up and uttered the war- cry, and sprang out of his place with the utmost agility, like a man guarding against a missile.
Buffoons also entered.
34.
When the sun was near setting, the Greeks rose, and said that it was time to place the guards for the night, and to give out the watch-word.
They requested Seuthes, at the same time, to give orders that none of the Thracians should enter the Greek camp by night;
" for," said they, " both your enemies are Thracians, and so are you, our friends."
1 35. As they were going out, Seuthes stood up, not at all like a man intoxicated, and, walking forth, and calling back the generals by themselves, said to them, "The enemy, my friends, know nothing as yet of our alliance ;
if, then.
we should march upon them before they are on their guard against a surprise, or are prepared to make any defence, we should be very likely to take both prisoners and booty."
36. The generals expressed their assent to what he said, and desired him to lead them. "
Prepare yourselves then," he replied, "and wait for me, and, when the proper time comes, I will come to you, and, taking the peltasts and yourselves, will, with the aid of the gods, conduet you." 37. "Consider however," rejoined Xenophon, "whether, since we are to march in the night, the Greek practice is not preferable;
for on the march, during the day, whatever part of the army be suitable for the ground, takes the lead, whether it be the heavy-armed men, or the peltasts, or the cavalry ;
but in the night it is the custom among the Greeks for the slowest part of the force to lead the way.
38. Thus the troops are least likely to be dispersed, and least in danger of straggling unobserved from one another ;
for bodies that have been separated often fall foul of each other, and both do and suffer injury unawares."
39. "You say well," replied Seuthes, " and I will conform to your custom ;
I will also pro­ vide you guides, some of the oldest men, best acquainted with the country ;
1 will bring up the rear myself with the cavalry, and, iF there be occasion, will soon come up to the front."
For the watch-word they fixed upon MINERVA, on account of their relationship.'
After this conversation they went to rest.
40.
When it was about midnight, Seuthes came to them with his cavalry clad in their corslets, and his peltasts equipped with their arms.
After he had appointed the guides, the heavy-armed men took the lead, the peltasts followed, and the cavalry formed the rear-guard.
41. As soon as it was day, Seuthes rode up to the front, and extolled the Greek custom, for he said that he himself, when marching in the night, though but with a small force, had often been separated, along with the cavalry, from the infantry;
" but now," he added, " we all appear in a body at break of day, as we ought to be.
But halt here, and take some rest, and I, after having taken a survey of the country, will return to you."
42. When he said this, he rode off over a hill, taking a particular road.
Having come to-some deep snow, he examined whether there were any footsteps of men on it, pointing either forward or the contrary way.
But as he found the way untrodden, he soon came back, and said, 43. " All will be well, my friends, if the gods be but favourable ;
for we shall fall upon the in­ habitants unawares.
For my own part, I will lead the way with the cavalry, in order that, if we come in sight of any per­ son, he may not run off and give notice to the enemy.
Follow me;
and, if you are left behind, keep in the track of the cavalry.
When we have crossed these hills, we shall come to a number of well-stored villages."44. When it was mid-day, lie had already reached the sum­ mit, and, after taking a view of the villages, came riding back to the heavy-armed men, and said, "I will now send off the horse to gallop down into the plain, and the peltasts to attack the villages.
Follow therefore as fast as you can, that it any of the enemy offer resistance, you may give your support."
45. Xenophon, on hearing this, alighted from his horse. " Why do you alight," inquired Seuthes, " when it is necessary to make haste ? "
"I am sure," replied Xenophon, " that you do not want me only;
and the heavy-armed men will hasten on with greater speed and alacrity, if I lead them on foot."
46. Seuthes then rode off, and Timasion, with about forty of the Greek cavalry, went with him.
Xenophon called on the most active men of each company, such as were under thirty years of age, to come forward, and, taking these, he hurried on, while Cleanor led up the rest of the Greeks.
47. When they came to the villages, Seuthes, riding up to Xenophon, with about fifty horse, said, " What you said,' Xenophon, has hap­ pened ;
the inhabitants are captured;
but my cavalry are gone off without a leader, pursuing the people some one way, some another ;
and I am afraid that the enemy, collecting in a body somewhere, may do us some mischief.
It is necessary, too, that some of us should remain in the villages, for they are full of people."
48. " I then," said Xenophon, "with the force that I have, will possess myself of the heights ;
and do you, meanwhile, order Cleanor to extend his line along through the plain by the villages."
When they had made this arrange­ ment, about a thousand slaves, two thousand oxen, and ten thousand head of other cattle, were captured.
They then took up their quarters there for the night.
Seuthes burns the villages, and takes more spoil.
The Greeks suffer from cold.
The Barbarians, who had fled, come down from the mountains on pretence of wishing to make a truce;
they thus reconnoitre the camp, and then attack the Greeks in the night, by whom they are repulsed;
they make submission to Seuthes, and their Lives are spared.
I. THE next day, Seuthes, having entirely burned the vil­ lages, and left not a single house standing, (in order to strike terror into the rest of the people, when they saw what they would sutler if they did not submit,) made a retreat, a.

it.
There was now a great fall of snow, and such severe frost, that the water which the attendants brought in for dinner, and the wine in the vessels, were frozen, and the noses and ears of many of the Greeks were bitten off.
4. Hence it became evident why the Thracians wear the skins of foxes over their heads and cars, and coats that extend not only over their breasts, but round their thighs ;
and why, when on horseback, they wear wide garments,1 not cloaks, reaching down to their feet.
5.
Seuthes, sending some of the prisoners to the mountains, made it known that if the inhabitants did not come down and submit to him, he would burn both their villages and their corn, and that they would then perish with hunger.
In con­ sequence the women, children, and old men came down, but the younger sort encamped in the villages at the foot of the hills.
6. Seuthes, on receiving notice of their proceedings, desired Xenophon to take the youngest of the heavy-armed men, and to follow him.
Starting, accordingly, in the night, they arrived at the villages by break of day.
Most of the occupants tied, for the mountains were elose at hand.
All that Seuthes took, he put to the spear without mercy.
7.
There was with him on this occasion one Episthenes,2 an Olynthian, a great lover of boys, who, seeing a handsome youth, just in his bloom, with a shield in his hand, about to be put to death, ran up to Xenophon, and begged him to intercede for so beautiful a young man.
8. Xenophon, going up to Seuthes, begged him not to kill the youth, and made him ac­ quainted, at the same time, with the character of Episthenes, telling him that lie once raised a company in which he made it his sole object that the men should be handsome;
and that at the head of these he proved himself a man of valour.
9. Seuthes then put this question to Episthenes :
"
Would you be willing, Episthenes, to die for this youth?"
Episthenes, stretching out his neck, replied, " Strike, if the youth desires it, and will feel grateful to me." to.
Seuthes next asked the youth whether he should kill Episthenes instead of him.
The youth would not consent, but besought him to kill neither.
Episthenes then embraced the youth, and said, "Now, Seuthes, you must fight with me for him ;
for I will not give up the youth."
11. Seuthes laughed, and did nothing further in the matter.
It was resolved by Seuthes that they should encamp where they were, in order that the people upon the mountains might not get subsistence from the villages.
He himself, going down a little lower into the plain, pitched his camp there.
Xeno­ phon, with the select body of men,1 fixed himself in the village highest up under the hills.
The rest of the Greeks took up their quarters close by, among the people called the mountain Thracians.
12.
Not many days had elapsed, when the Thracians, coming down from the hills to Seuthes, made a treaty with him about a peace, and the giving of hostages.
Xenophon, at the same time, went and told Seuthes that they were encamped in a dangerous place, and that the enemy were near at hand, and said that he would rather encamp in some secure post abroad, than in a sheltered position with the danger of being cut off.
Seuthes bade him fear nothing, and pointed to the hostages then in his hands.
13. Some of the people from the moun­ tains, too, came down and begged Xenophon to assist them in effecting a treaty.
Xenophon assented, told them to keep up their spirits, and engaged that they should suffer no harm if they submitted to Seuthes.
But they had come with this re­ quest only for the purpose of acting as spies.
14. These things took place during the day.
In the course of the following night the Thracians came down from the hills and attacked them.
Each master of a house acted as a leader, for it would have been difficult for them, under any other ar­ rangement, to find the houses in the villages in the dark, as they were surrounded with high palisades to secure the cattle.
15. When they came up to the door of each house, some hurled their spears in at them, others struck them with their clubs which they carried, they said, to knock off the heads of the spears, while others set fire to the buildings, and calling for Xe.
nophon by name, bade him come forth and be put to death ;
or else they declared that he should be burned to ashes upon the spot.
16. The fire soon began to show itself through the roof, and Xenophon and his men were within, with their corslets on, and their shields, swords, and helmets1 in their hands, when Silanus, a native of Macestus,2 about eighteen years of age,3 blew a signal with the trumpet, and they immediately rushed out, with their swords drawn, as well as those from the neighbouring houses.
IT.
The Thracians at once took t- flight, slinging their shields, as was their custom, over the­ shoulders ;
and some of them, as they were trying to leap ovet the palisades, were caught and suspended, their shields stick­ ing fast among the stakes ;
some were killed through missing the outlets;
and the Greeks drove the rest out of the village.
IS.
A party of the Thynians, however, came back under cover of the darkness, and hurled their javelins at some of the Greeks that were running past a burning house, taking aim out- of the darkness at those who were in the light;
they wounded Hiero­ nymus a Euodean,4 and Theogenes a Locrian, both captains ;
but nobody was killed;
though the clothes and baggage of some of them were burned.
19. Seuthes came to their relief with seven horsemen, the first that he met, bringing with him the Thracian trumpeter;
and, when he saw how matters stood, the trumpet, by his orders, continued to sound as long as he was on the march to give aid;
so that this noise also contributed to strike terror into the enemy.
When he came up, he congratulated the Greeks, and said that he had ex­ pected to find many of them killed.
20.
Xenophon then requested Scuthes to give up the host­ ages to him,1 and to march with him, if lie was willing, to the mountains ;
if not, to permit him to go himself.
21. The next day, accordingly, Seuthes gave him the hostages, (who were men of advanced age, the most considerable persons, as they said, among the mountaineers,) and joined him with his army.
Scuthes had now a force three times as large as before ;
2 for many of the Odrysæ, on hearing what he was doing, had come down to take the field with him.
22. The Thynians, when they beheld from the mountains so vast a force of heavy- armed men, peltasts, and cavalry, came down and besought him to make peace with them, engaging to serve him in every way, and requesting him to accept pledges from them.
23. Seuthes, calling in Xenophon, communicated to him what they said, and observed, at the same time, that he would not make peace, if Xenophon wished to take revenge on them for their attack.
24. Xenophon replied, " I consider my­ self sufficiently revenged, if these people, instead of remain­ ing free, are to become slaves;
" adding, however, that he advised him to take as hostages in future those who had most power to harm him, and to let the old men stay at home.
All the people in this part of the country accordingly submitted 10 Seuthes.
The Greeks are not paid in full, yet continue to serve Seuthes;
the soldiers are dissatisfied, on this account, with Xenophon.
Unfairness of Seuthes;
the expedition to Salmydessus.1.
TIIEY now crossed over3 to the Thracians above By­ zantium, into what is called the Delta.
This had not formed any part of the dominion of Mæsades,1 though it had belonged 10 Teres, a son of Odryses,2 some ancient king.
2. Here He­ raclides met them with the price of the spoil.
Seuthes, selecting three pairs of mules, (for there were no more,) and others of oxen, sent for Xenophon and requested him to accept the first for himself, and to distribute the others among the generals and captains.
3. Xenophon replied, "For myself it will be sufficient to receive something another time ;
give these to the generals and captains that have followed you in company with me."
4. Timasion the Dardanian then re­ ceived one of the pairs, Cleaner the Orchomenian another, and Phryniscus the Achæan the third ;
the pairs of oxen were divided among the captains.
But Seuthes gave the army only twenty days' pay, though the month was expired;
for Heraelides said that he had been unable to sell any more.
3 5. Xenophon, being concerned at this deficiency, exclaimed, with an imprecation, "Yon seem to me, Heraclides, not to have such care for the interests of Seuthes as you ought to have;
for, if you had such care, you would have brought the full pay, even though you had borrowed money to make it up, or sold your own clothes, if you could not raise the sum by any other means."6.
At this reproach Heraclides was extremely vexed, and feared that he should be deprived of the friendship of Seuthes ;
and, from that day, in whatever way he could, he laboured to bring Xenophon into disgrace with Seuthes.
7. The soldiers, too, threw blame upon Xenophon because they did not receive their pay;
and Seuthes was displeased with him because he was earnest in demanding it for them.
s.
Until that time he had been constantly telling him that, when he arrived at the sea, lie would put him in possession of Bisauthe, and Ganos, I The father of Seuthes, c. 2, sect.

Bornemann.
The sense of the pas­ sage seems to be that the Delta had formerly been part of the king­ dom of the Odrysæ in the time of Teres, but had ceased to belong to it before or during the reign of Mæsades, the father of Seuthes.
and Ncontichos, but, after that period, he alluded to none of those places ;
for Heraclides had maliciously insinuated that it was not safe to intrust fortresses to a man at the head of an army.
9.
Xenophon, in consequence, began to consider with him­ self what he ought to do about the expedition farther up the country.
Heraclides, meantime, was thrusting the other ge­ nerals upon Seuthes, and urging them to say that they could lead the army not less effetively than Xenophon ;
he assured them also that, in a few days, their full pay for two months should be given them, and recommended them to continue in the service of Seuthes.
10. To this Timasion replied, "For my part, even if five months' pay were to be given me, I would not serve without Xenophon."
Phryniseus and Cleamor expressed the same sentiments as Tin.asion.
II, Seuthes then blamed Heraclides for not calling in Xe­ nophon with them ;
and they accordingly sent for him alone.
But Xenophon, seeing that this was a trick of Heraclides, to render him unpopular with the rest of the generals, took with.
him, when he went, not only all the generals, but all the cap­ tains.
12. As they were all moved by the arguments of Seuthes, they joined him in an expedition, and proceeded through the country of the Thracians called Melinophagi, keeping the Euxine Sea on the right, to Salmydessus, Here many of the ships sailing into the Euxine are grounded and driven ashore ;
for a shoal there stretches far out into the sea.
13.
The Thracians who live in those parts, set up pillars as boundaries, and each party plunder the wrecks stranded on their own portion of the coast;
but for some time before they erected the pillars, it was said that they fell in great numbers by the hands of each other while engaged in plundering.
14. In this place were found couches, boxes, written books,.
and many other things, such as seamen carry in their wooden store-chests.
1 Having subdued this people, they went back again.
15. Seuthes had now an army superior in number to that of the Greeks;
for many more of the Odrysoe had come down to him, and others, as fast as they submitted, joined his force.
They encamped in a plain above Selybria, at the dis­ tance of about thirty stadia from the sea.
16. No pay as yet appeared ;
the soldiers were greatly dissatisfied with Xeno­ phon;
and Seuthes no longer treated him with familiarity, but, whenever he went to desire to speak with him, many en­ gagements were pretended.
The Greeks are solicited by the Lacedæmonians to join them in a war with Tissaphernes, when a certain Arcadian brings a formal accusation against Xenophon ;
he defends himself, and is justified by others.
He is requested by Scuthes to remain in his service with a thousand men, but resolves to depart.
I.
AT this time, when two months had nearly expired, Charminus, a Lacedæmonian, and Pulynicus, came from Thi­ bron, and stated that the Lacedæmonians had resolved to take the field against Tissaphernes, and that Thibron2 had set sail for tIle purpose of carrying on the war with him ;
adding that he was in want of this auxiliary force, and promised that a daric a month should be the pay for each common soldier, twice as much for the captains, and four times as much for the generals.
a.
When these Lacedæmonians arrived, Heraclides.
hearing that they were come for the army, remarked to Seu­ thes that it was a fortunate occurrence, " for the Lacedæmoni­ ans," said he, " are in want of the army, and you no longer require it;
by resigning it, therefore, you will gratify them, and the soldiers will cease to ask you for pay, and will leave the country.
"3. Seuthes, listening to these representations, desired him to bring the Lacedæmonians to him;
and as they told him that they were come for the army, he said that he would give it up, and was willing to be their friend and ally, and invited them to a banquet, at which he entertained them magnificently, but did not invite Xenophon, or any of the other generals.
4. The Lacedæmonians inquiring what sort of a person Xeno­ phon was, he replied, that in other respects he was not a bad man, but that he was a great friend to the soldiers, " and on that account," added he, " it is the worse for him."
1 " Does the man then," said they, " try to make himself popular with the soldiers?" " Certainly," replied Heraclides.
5. "Will he not then oppose us," said they, "respecting the removal of the army?"
But if you call the soldiers together," rejoined He­ raclides, " and promise them pay, they will show little regard to him, and will hasten away with you."
6. " How, then," said they, "can they be assembled to hear us ?" " To-morrow morning," answered Heraclides, " we will bring you to them, and I feel assured that, as soon as they see you, they will readily flock together."
Thus ended that day.
7. Next morning Seuthes and Heraclides conducted the Lacedæmonians to the army, and the soldiers were called to­ gether.
The Lacedæmonians then stated that it was resolved by their countrymen to go to war with Tissaphernes, " who," said they, " has injured you.
If therefore you join with us, you will both revenge yourselves on an enemy, and will re­ ceive, each of you, a daric a month, a captain double, and a general fourfold."
8. The soldiers listened to this offer will.
pleasure;
and one of the Arcadians immediately rose up to make an accusation against Xenophon.
Semites was also pre­ sent.
being desirous to know how the matter would end, find was standing where he could easily hear, attended by an in terpreter, though he himself understood most of what was spoken in Greek, a. The Arcadian proceeded to say, " We should certainly, 0 Lacedæmonians, have been with you long ago, if Xenophon had not wrought upon us and led us hither, where, serving through a severe winter, we have had no rest night or day ;
while he has the fruit of our labours, and Seu­ thes enriches him personally, and deprives us of our pay;
10.
so that if I, who am the first to speak on this occasion, could see him stoned to death, and paying the penalty for what he has made us suffer in dragging us about, I should think that I had received my pay, and should cease to be concerned at what I have undergone."
After him another stood up, and then another;
whell Xenophon proceeded to speak as follows:
II.
"
A mail may well, indeed, expect any kind of fate, since I now meet with accusations from you, at a time when I am conscious of having displayed the utmost zeal to serve you.
After I had set out homewards, I turned back, not certainly from learning 'liat you were in a satisfactory condition, but rather from hearing that you were in difficulties, and with the intention of aiding you if I could.
2 12. When I got back to the army, though Seuthes here sent many messengers to me, and promised me many advantages, if I would induce you to go to him, I made no attempt, as you yourselves know, to do so, but led you to a place3 from which I thought you would have the quickest passage into Asia;
for I considered that this course would be best for you, and knew that you desired it.
is.
But -hen Aristarehus came with his galleys, and prevented you from sailing aeross, I then (as was doubtless proper) calle you together, that we might consider what measures we ought to take.
14. After hearing then Aristar­ chus, on the one hand, desiring you to go to the Chersonesus, and listening to Seuthes, on the other, urging you to take the field with him, you all said that you would go with Seuthes, and all gave your votes for that course.
In what respect then did I wrong you on that occasion, by leading you whither you all resolved to go ?is. "
Since Seuthes, however, has begun to break his word concerning your pay, you, if I were to express approbation of his conduct, would justly accuse and detest me :
but if I, who was previously his greatest friend, am now most of all men at variance with him, with what reason can I, who have prefer­ red your interest to that.
of Seuthes, incur censure from you for that very conduct through which I have brought upon me his enmity?
16. But perhaps you may say that I have re­ ceived your pay from Seuthes, and am merely deluding you.
This however is certain, that if Seuthes has paid me anything, he did not pay it with a view of losing what he gave me, and of paying, at the same time, an additional sum to you ;
but, I should think, if he had given me anything, he would have given it with this intention, that by bestowing on me a less sum, he might not have to pay you a greater.
17. If there­ fore you suppose that such is the ease, it is in your power to render the compact profitless to both of us, by requiring from him your pay ;
for it is evident that Seuthes, if I have re­ ceived anything from him, will in that case demand it back from me, and will demand it justly, if I fail to fulfil the coil­ tract for which I was bribed?
IS.
But I am conscious of being far from possessing anything that belongs to you ;
for I swear to you by all the gods and goddesses, that I have not even received what Seuthes promised me for myself;
and he is himself present, and as he hears me, knows whether I com­ init perjury or not;
19.
and, that you may be still more sur­ prised, I swear that I have not even received as much as the other generals have received, no, nor even as much as some of the captains.
20. From what motive, then, did I act thus?
I thought, my fellow-soldiers, that the more I participated in his poverty for the time, the more effectually should I render him my friend when he should be able to serve me.
But I now see him at once in a state of prosperity, and understand his real disposition.
21. Possibly some one may say, , Are you not ashamed, then, of having been thus foolishly deceived ?'
I should indeed be ashamed, if I had been thus deceived by an enemy, but in a friend it appears far more disgraceful to de­ ceive than to be deceived.
22. If however we are to be on our guard against friends, I know that we have been on the strictest guard not to give Seuthes any just pretence for re­ fusing to pay us what he promised;
for we have neither done him any harm, nor neglected his interests, nor shrunk from any undertaking to which he called us.
23. " But, you may say, I ought to have taken pledges at the time, that even if he had had the will, lie might not have had the power to deceive.
With regard to this point, hear what I should never have mentioned before him,1 if you had not shown yourselves either extremely inconsiderate or ex­ tremely ungrateful towards me.
24. For recollect in what circumstances you were placed, when I extricated you from them by conducting you to Seuthes.
Did not 2 Aristarchus the Lacedæmonian prevent you from entering Perinthus, shut­ ting the gates if you offered to approach the city ?
Did you not encamp without the walls in the open air ?
Was it not the middle of winter?
Had you not to buy provisions, when you found but few commodities for sale, and had but little with which to buy ?
25. Were you not obliged to remain in Thrace, because galleys at anchor preveNted you from sailing across, while, whoever stayed, had to stay in an enemy's country, where there were numbers of cavalry and numbers of peltasts to oppose you ?
26.
And though we had a heavy- armed force, with which, going to the villages in a body, we might perhaps have procured a moderate supply of food, we had no troops with which we could pursue or capture slaves or cattle;
for I found neither cavalry nor peltasts any longer existing in a body among you.
27. If, then, when you were in such straits, I had, without demanding any pay for you, procured you Seuthes as an ally, who had cavalry and pel­ tasts, of which you were in want, should I have appeared to have consulted ill for you ?
28.
For, through having the aid of these troops, you not only found a greater abundance of provisions in the villages, from the Thracians being obliged to flee with greater precipitation, but had a greater share of both cattle and slaves.
29.
As for enemies, we no longer saw any after the cavalry was attached to us, though, before that time, they pursued us both with horse and peltasts, hindering us from dispersing anywhere in small parties, so as to get pro. visions in greater quantities.
so.
And if he who afforded you this security, did not give you, in addition, very high pay for the security,' is this the dreadful calamity of which you complain, and do you think that, on this account, you ought by no means to allow me to live ?31.
"But under what circumstances is it that you are now leaving the country?
Is it not after having passed the winter in the midst of abundance, and while you have in your pos­ session, besides, whatever you have received from Seuthes?
What you have consumed belonged to the enemy;
and, while faring thus, you have neither seen any of your number killed, nor lost any alive.
32. If any reputation had been gained by you against the Barbarians in Asia, have you not that still undiminished, and have you not added to it new glory by sub­ duing the Thracians, against whom you took the field, in Europe?
I think, indeed, that you may justly return thanks to the gods, as for so many blessings, for those very things for which you are incensed against me.
33. " Such is the state of your affairs;
and now, in the name of the gods, consider what is the condition of mine.
When I first set sail for home, I went off with great praise from you, and with honour, through your means, from the rest of the Greeks.
I was also trusted by the Lacedæmonians, or they would not have sent me back to you.
2 34.
But now I go away calumniated in the eyes of the Lacedæmonians by your statements, and at enmity with Seuthes upon your ac­ count, whom I hoped, by serving him in conjunction with you, to secure as an honourable protector both for myself and my children, if I should have any.
35. Yet you, for whose sake chiefly I have incurred hatred, and incurred it from people far more powerful than myself, and while I do not yet cease attempting whatever good I can for you, entertain such an opinion of me as you now express.
36. But you have me in your power, having neither found me fleeing nor attempting to flee;
and, if you do what you say, you will put to death a. man who has often watched for your safety;
who has gone through many toils and dangers in company with yon, accord­ ing to his share and beyond his share;
who, by the favour of the gods, has raised with you many trophies over the Bar­ barians ;
and who has exerted himself most strenuously for you,1 in every way that he could, in order that you might not make yourselves enemies to any of the Greeks.
37. As it is, you are at liberty to go whither you please, by set or land, without censure;
and now, when abundance of everything presents itself before you, when you are going to sail whither you have long desired to go, when those who are at the height of power solicit your services, when pay is offered, and when Lacedæmonians, who are thought to be the best of leaders, are come to take the command of you, does it seem to you to be a fit time for putting me at once to death ?
38. You had no such inclination when we were in the midst of hard­ ships, 0 men of admirable memories!
2
You then called me father, and promised always to remember me as your bene­ factor.
However, those, who are now come to request your services, are not void of judgment, so that, as I think, you will not, by being such as you are towards me, appear better in their estimation."
Having spoken thus, he ceased.
39.
Charminus, the Lacedæmonian, then stood up and said, " By the twin gods,3 soldiers, you do not appear to be dis­ pleased with this man on any reasonable grounds;
for I my­ self can bear testimony in his favour:
since, when Polymecus and myself asked Seuthes about Xenophon, inquiring what sort of man lie was, he had nothing else to lay to his charge, but, as he said, that he was a great friend to the soldiers, on which account, he observed, it was worse for him1 both with us Lacedæmonians and with himself."
40. Eurylochus an Arcadian, a native of Lusia,2 rising up after him, exclaimed, " It seems to me, Lacedæmonians, that your first act of gener­ alship for us should be this, to exact our pay from Seuthes, either with his consent or against it, and that, till you do so, you ought not to lead us from hence."
41. Polycrates, the Athenian, next rose and spoke in favour of Xenophon :
3 " I see," said he, “ soldiers, Heraclides also present here, who, after receiving the spoil which we obtained by our exertions, and having sold it, gave the proceeds neither to Seuthes nor to us, but, having appropriated it to himself, still keeps possession of it.
If therefore we are wise, we shall lay hold of him, for he is not a Thracian, but, being himself a Greek, acts dis­ honestly to Greeks."42. Heraclides, on hearing this remark, was still more4 alarmed, and, moving towards Seuthes, said, " If we are wise,5 we shall withdraw from hence, out of the power of these men."
Mounting their horses, accordingly, they rode off to their own camp;
43.
from whence Seuthes sent Abrozelmes, his inter­ preter, to Xenophon, and begged him to remain in his service with a thousand heavy-armed men, engaging at the same time, to give him the fortresses on the sea, and the other things which he had promised him.
He also told him, causing it to be com­ municated as a secret, that he had heard from Polynicus, that if he fell into the hands of the Lacedaemonians, he would cer­ tainly be put to death by Thibron.
44. Many other persons, too, sent notice to Xenophon that be had been made an object of calumny, and ought to be upon his guard.
Xenophon, on receiving these communications, took two victims and sacri­ ficed to Jupiter, consulting him whether it would be better for him to stay with Seuthes on the conditions that he pro­ posed, or to go away with the army.
Jupiter signified to him that he had better depart.
The Greeks go to get provisions from the villages.
Medosades tries tosend them away, and prevails on Xenophon to go and consult the Lacedæmoni­ ans.
The Lacedæmonians refuse to take away the army till Seuthes has paid them.
Xenophon's speech to Seuthes.
Seuthes at last produces the money, which Xenophon gives to the Lacedæmonians to be distributed among the soldiers.
1.
SEUTHES then encamped at a great distance;
and the Greeks quartered in villages from which they intended to get plenty of provisions, and then to march to the sea.
These villages had been given by Seuthes to Medosades;
2. who, seeing his property in them consumed by the Greeks, was much displeased;
and, taking with him one of the Odrysa?, the most influential of all those that had come down from the upper country, and about fifty horse, went and called Xenophon out of the Grecian camp.
Xenophon, taking some of the captains, and other proper persons, came out to meet him.
3. Medosades then said, "You act unjustly, 0 Xenophon, in laying waste our villages.
We give you notice therefore, I on the part of Seuthes, and this man on the part of Medocus the king of the upper country, to quit this district;
if, however, you do not quit it, we shall not allow you to continue your depredations, but, if you do harm to our territories, we shall defend ourselves against you as enemies.
"4. Xenophon, on hearing this warning, said, " To give you in answer, when you speak in such terms, is painful, yet for the information of this young man, I will reply to you, that he may know what sort of people you are, and what sort we are.
5. We," lie continued, "before we became your allies, march­ ed through this country whithersoever we thought fit, laying waste what we pleased, and burning what we pleased ;
6.
and you yourself, when you came to us as an ambassador, pitched your tent with us, without fear of any enemy;
but your people never entered this region at all, or, if ever you did venture into it, used to encamp with your horses still bridled, as in the territory of those more powerful than yourselves.
7. But now, since you have become allied with us, and have by our means, and with the assistance of the gods, got possession of the country, you would drive us from that very land which you received from us, when we held it as our own by force of arms, for, as you are aware, the enemy were not strong enough to dispossess us.
8. And you would send us away, not only without offering us a present, or doing us any service in re­ turn for the benefits that you have received from us, but evei.
without allowing us to encamp, as far as you are able to pre­ vent us, when we are just taking our departure.
9. In ad­ dressing us thus, you show no respect either for the gods or for the man that accompanies you, who beholds you now abounding in wealth, but who saw you, before you were our ally, supporting your existence by plunder, as you yourself have acknowledged.1 to.
But why do you address yourself thus to me," added Xenophon, “for I no longer hold the com­ mand, but the Lacedæmonians, to whom you gave the army that they might lead it away, and gave it, 0 most admirable of men, without calling on me to take part in the resignation of it, so that, as I incurred their disapprobation when I brought it to you, I might now do them a pleasure by restor­ ing it to them."it.
When the Odrysian heard this account, he said, "I, 0 Medosades, am ready to sink into the earth with shame, as I listen to such a statement.
Had I known this before, I should certainly not have accompanied you, and shall now take my de­ parture ;
for Medocus, my king, would by no means approve my conduct, if I should assist in expelling his benefactors from the country."
12. As he uttered these words, he mounted his horse and rode off, and all the other horsemen went with him, except four or five.
But Medosades (for the devastation of the country made him uneasy) requested Xenophon to call to him the two Lacedæmonians.
13. Xenophon, taking the most eligible persons to attend him, went to Charminus and Polynicus, and told them that Medosades wished to speak with them, intending to warn them, as they had warned him, to quit the country.
14. "I think, therefore," continued Xenophon, " that you might secure the pay owing to the army, if you were to say that the troops have entreated you to support them in obtaining their dues from Seuthes, whether with his consent or without it;
that they engage to follow you cheerfully if they gain their object;
that they appear to you to say what is just;
and that you have promised them not to depart until they have received their just demands."
IS.
The Lacedæmonians replied that they would say this, and what­ ever else they might be able to urge with the greatest effect;
and immediately set out, with all proper persons accompany­ ing them.
When they arrived, Charminus said, " If you have anything to say to us, Medosades, speak ;
if not, we have something to say to you."
16. Medosades replied, very submissively, "I have to say, and Seuthes says the same, that we desire that those who have become our friends may suffer no evil at your hands ;
for whatever harm you do to them, you do at the same time to us, as they are our allies.”
17. “ We, then," said the Lacedæmonians, " shall be ready to depart, when those who have effected such services for you, have received their pay ;
if they do not receive it, we are here even now to take their part, and to take vengeance on such as have wronged them in violation of their oaths.
If you are of that number, it is from you that we shall begin to require justice for them."
18. " Would you be willing, Medosades,” rejoined Xenophon, " to leave it to the people in whose country we are, (as you say that they are your friends,) to decide whether it is fit that you should quit the country, or we ?”
19.
To this proposal he would not consent, but urged the two Lacedæmonians by all means to go to Seuthes about the pay, and said that he thought they would succeed with Seuthes;
if they did not, he re­ quested them to send Xenophon with him, and promised to support their application.
In the mean time he begged them not to burn the villages.
20.
They then deputed Xenophon, and those who appeared most eligible along with him.
When he came to Seuthes, ho said, “1 am not come, 0 Seuthes, to ask anything of you, but to convince you, if I am able, 21.
that you had no just cause to be displeased with me for demanding, on behalf of the soldiers, the pay which you so readily promised them;
since I thought it would be not less advantageous for you to pay it than for them to receive it;
22.
for I knew that, next to the gods, they have been instrumental in placing you in a con­ spicuous position, by making you king over a large extent of country and great numbers of people, so that it is not possible for you to escape the notice of mankind, whether you do what is good or what is evil.
23. To a man in such a con­ dition it seems to me to be of no small importance that he should not be thought to send away his benefactors with­ out gratitude;
of importance also to have the approbation of six thousand men;
and most important of all to show that you are never to be distrusted in what you say.
24. For I observe the words of the faithless wander about without power, influ­ ence, or regard ;
while the words of those who are known to observe truth, are not less effectual, if they desire anything, in accomplishing their desire, than the strength of other men ;
if they wish to recall any one to his duty, I know that the threats of such men are not less influential in producing re­ form than the actual punishments of others;
and if men of such a character promise anything, they produce no less ef­ fect by their promises than others by giving at the moment.
25. Consider with yourself:
what did you pay us before you obtained our alliance ?
You know that you paid us nothing;
but from confidence being placed in you that you would truly perform what you said, you induced such a number of men to join you in the field, and to conquer for you a kingdom not worth fifty talents merely, the sum which they now think they ought to receive from you, but many times that sum.
26. First of all, then, this confidence which was placed in you, and which secured you the kingdom, is bartered away by you for this sum of money.
27. “Consider, too, how great a matter you then thought it to obtain those dominions which you have now subjugated and possess.
I am well aware that you would have prayed for the accomplishment of what has now been done for you rather than for many times such a sum of money.
28. To me, then, it seems a greater disadvantage, as well as a greater disgrace, not to retain this power than not to have acquired it;
just as it is more grievous to a man to become poor after being rich than never to have been rich at all, and as it is more afflicting to appear as a private man after having been a king, than never to have been on a throne.
29. You are sensible, moreover, that those who have now become your subjects, have not submitted to be governed by you from any affection for you personally, but from necessity, and that they would endeavour to make themselves free again, if there were no fear to restrain them.
30. Whether therefore do you think that they will be more under the restraint of fear, and act more sensibly for your interests, if they should see these troops so disposed towards you, as to be willing to stay now if you request them, or soon to return again if it should be necessary, End find that others, hearing many good accounts of you from.
these, are ready to join you at once whenever you wish.;
or if they should form an unfavourable opinion of you, and believe that no others will engage in your service through distrust arising from what has now happened, and that the Greeks are better affected towards your new subjects than yourself?
31. These people, besides, did not submit to you because they were inferior in number to us, but because they wanted lead­ ers.
It is now a matter of apprehension, then, that they may choose some of our men, who think themselves wronged by you, or the Lacedæmonians, who are still more powerful than they, as leaders, especially if, on the one hand, our soldiers promise to serve the Lacedæmonians with greater alacrity, on condition that they.
exact what is due to them from you, and the Lacedæmonians, on the other, assent to this condition from the need which they have of our army.
32. That the Thracians who have just become subject to you, would march against you much more willingly than with you, is indisput­ able ;
for, while you hold the mastery, servitude is their lot, but, if you are conquered, freedom.33. " If, again, it be your business to take forethought for the country, as being your own property, whether you do think that it would be less exposed to harm, if these soldiers, after having received from you what they claim, should go away leaving peace behind them, or if they stay in the coun­ try as in that of an enemy, and you, with other soldiers more umerous than they, who will be constantly in want of pro­ visions, proceed to take the field against them ?
34. Or whe­ ther will more money be expended by you, if what is due to the Greeks be paid, or if this be left due, and you have at the same time to take other troops, able to overcome them, into your service ?35.
"But this sum, in the opinion of Heraclides, (as he ex­ pressed himself to me,) appears excessively large.
It is doubtless, however, a much lighter matter for you either to receive or pay such a sum, than it was, before we joined you, to receive or pay the tenth part of it.
36. For it is not the actual amount that defines the much or the little, but the ability of him who has to pay or to receive.
But your annual income is now greater than the whole of the property which you formerly possessed.
37. " In these observations, 0 Seuthes, I have had regard to your interest as to that of a friend, in order that you may appear worthy of the advantages which the gods have be­ stowed upon you, and that I, at the same time, may not lose all reputation with the army.
38. For be assured, that if I now wished to do harm to an enemy, I should not be able to effect it with these troops, and that, if I desired again to give assistance to you, I should not be in a condition to do so;
such is the feeling of the army towards me.
39. Yet I call both you yourself, and the gods who know the truth, to witness, that I have neither received anything from you on account of the soldiers, nor have I ever asked of you, for my own private use, what was due to them, nor have I claimed what you pro­ mised me.
40. I also swear to you, that, even though you had offered to pay me, I would not have received anything from you, unless the soldiers had been at the same time to receive what was due to them ;
for it would have been disgraceful in me to have settled my own business, and to have allowed theirs to continue in an unsatisfactory condition, especially when I had received honour from them.
1 "
To Ileraclides, however, everything seems a trifle, in comparison with the acquirement of money by whatever means.
But I, 0 Seuthes, think no possession more honour­ able or more glorious to a man than that of virtue, and justice, and generosity.
42. lie that has these qualities, is rich in the numerous friends that lie has, and rich in the good-will of numbers that wish to become his friends ;
if he is prosperous, he has associates ready to rejoice with him ;
if he meets with a reverse of fortune, he is not in want of people to lend him aid.
-13. " If you have neither understood from my actions that I am a friend to you at heart, nor are able to discover it from my words, yet consider, by all means, the expressions of the soldiers concerning me;
for you were present and heard what those said who sought to asperse rile.
44. They accused me to the Lacedæmonians of regarding you more than them ;
they also charged me with taking more care that your affairs might prosper than their own ;
and they added, that I had received presents from you.
4.5. Whether, then, do you think that they accused me of having received those presents from you, because they saw in me some ill-will towards you, or because they observed in me a great zeal for your good ?
46.
I consider, indeed, that all men are of opinion that grati­ tude ought to be cherished1 towards him from whom they have received favours.
You, before I did you any service, entertained me favourably with looks, and words, and demon­ strations of hospitality, and were never satisfied with promis­ ing how great rewards should be mine;
and now, when you have accomplished what you desired, and have become as great as I could assist you to become, have you the heart to allow me to be thus dishonoured among the soldiers ?
47. I have nevertheless confidence that time will yet teach you to resolve to pay, and that you, of yourself, will not endure to see those who freely did you service,' loading you with re­ proaches.
I entreat you, then, when you make the payment, to study to leave me in as much credit with the army as you found me.
"48. Seuthes, on hearing this address, uttered imprecations on the man who had been the cause that the debt was not dis­ charged long before ;
(and every one surmised that Heracli­ des was meant ;
) " for," said he, " I never meant to deprive the men of their pay, and will now give it to them."
49. Xenophon then said again, " Since therefore you are resolved to pay, I now beg you to make the payment through me, and not to suffer me, on your account, to bear a different character with the army from that which I bore when we came to you." so.
Seuthes replied, " You shall not lose more credit with the army by my means ;
and if you will stay with me with only a thousand heavy-armed men, I will give you the fortresses, and everything else that I promised."
51. “It cannot be so," re­ joined Xenophon ;
“ let us therefore depart.”
“Yet I know," replied Seuthes, “that it will be safer for you to remain with me than to go away." 52. "I commend2 your care of me," rejoined Xenophon, "but it is impossible for me to stay ;
yet be assured that wherever I receive greater honour, there will be good attendant on it for you."
53. Seuthes then said, "I have but very little money, and that I give you, one talent;
3 but I have six hundred oxen, four thousand sheep, and a hun­ dred and twenty slaves;
take these, and the hostages4 from those who were treacherous to you, and depart."
54. “And if these," said Xenophon, laughing, "are not sufficient to make up the pay, for whom shall I say that I have the talent ?
I Will it not be better for me, since danger threaten?
me, to secure myself against stoning by taking my departure?
2
You heard the threats."
The remainder of that day they continued there.
55. The next day Seuthes delivered to them the cattle he had promised, and sent men with them to drive them.
The soldiers, in the mean time, began to say that Xenophon was gone to Seuthes to live with him, and to receive what Seuthes had promised him;
but when they saw him returning, they were rejoiced, and ran to meet him.
56. As soon as Xeno­ phon saw Charminus and Polynicus, he said, “This property has been saved for the army through your influence ;
I deliver it to you;
dispose of it, and divide the proceeds among the soldiers."
The Lacedæmonians accordingly received the cattle, and, appointing salesmen, sold it, and incurred much blame.3 57. As for Xenophon, he took no part in the pro­ ceeding, but openly prepared to return home;
for a vote of banishment had not yet been passed against him at Athens.
But his friends in the camp came to him, and begged him not to desert them until he had led off the army and delivered it to Thibron.
The Greeks pass over to Lampsacus.
Xenophon, having received no pay, is obliged to sell his horse.
lie sacrifices to Jupiter Meilichius.
The Greeks arrive at Pergamus.
Xenophon is prevailed upon to attack Asidates, a Persian nobleman, and at length takes him prisoner, with a great quantity of booty, of which he receives a considerable share.
He delivers the army into the hands of Thibron, to be incorporated with the forces assembled against Tissaphernes.
I. FROM hence they sailed across to Lampsacus, when Eu­ elides the augur, a native of Phlius,l the son of Cleagoras, who wrote THE DREAMS IN THE LYCEUM,2 came to meet Xeno­ phon.
He congratulated Xenophon on haying returned safe, and asked him how much gold lie had.
a. Xenophon assured him, with an oath, that he should not have enough for his ex­ penses in travelling home, unless he sold his horse, and what he had about him.
Euclides did not believe him.
3. But after the people of Lampsacus had sent presents to Xenophon, and Xenophon was proceeding to sacrifice to Apollo, he made Euclides stand beside him at the time, who, on inspecting the victims, said that he was now convinced he had no money. "
But I observe,” added he, " that even if money should ever be likely to come to you, there will be some obstacle, and, if no other, that you will be an obstacle to yourself."
1 Xeno­ phon assented to the justice of the observation.
4. Jupiter Meilichius,2 however, said Euclides, “is an obstacle in your way;
" and then asked whether he had ever sacrificed to that god, "as I was accustomed," continued he, "to sacrifice and offer holocausts for you at home."
3 Xenophon replied, that since he had left home he had not sacrificed to that deity.
Euclides then advised him to sacrifice as he had been used to do, and said that it would be for his advantage.
5. Next day, Xenophon, going on to Ophrynium, offered a sacrifice, burning whole hogs4 after the custom of his country, and found the omens favourable.
6.
The same day Biton and Euclides5 came to bring pay for the army.
These men were hospitably entertained6 byThe Lyceum was a sacred enclosure at Athens, dedicated to Apollo, where the polemarch originally kept his court.
It was de­ corated with fountains, plantations, and buildings, and became the usual place of exercise for the Athenian youth who devoted them­ selves to military pursuits.
Nor was it less frequented by philoso­ pliers, and it was especially the favourite resort of Aristotle and his followers.
Cramer's Ancient Greece, vol. ii. p. 340.
Xenophon, and having repurchased his horse, which he had sold at Lampsacus for fifty darics, (as they suspected that lie had parted with it from necessity, for they had heard that he was fond of the horse,) they restored it to him, and would not receive from him the price of it.
7.
Hence they advanced through Troas, and, passing over Ida, came first to Antandrus ;
then, proceeding along by the sea, they arrived at the plain of Thebe in Lydia.
1
8. March­ ing from hence through Atramyttiuin and Certorium, by Atarneus, to the plain of the Caicus, they reached Pergamus in Mysia.
Here Xenophon was hospitably received by Hellas the wife of Gongylus of Eretria,2 and mother of Gorgion and Gon­ gylus.
9. She told him that Asidates, a Persian, resided in the plain, and said that if he would attack him in the night with three hundred men, he might take him, with his wife and children, and his wealth, which was considerable.
10. To guide him in the enterprise she sent her own cousin, and a man named Daphnagoras, whom she greatly esteemed;
and Xenophon, having these with him, offered sacrifice.
Basias, an augur from Elis, who was present, said that the omens wero extremely favourable, and that the man might easily be cap­ tured.
11. After supper, accordingly, he set out, taking with him such of the captains as were most attached to him, and had constantly been his friends, in order that he might do them a service.
3
Others also came to join the party, forcing themselves upon him, to the number of six hundred;
but the captains sent them back, that they might not have to give them any portion of the booty, which they regarded as ready to their hands.
12.
When they came to the place, about midnight, the slaves that were about the castle, and the greater part of the cattle, escaped them, as they neglected these in order that they might capture Asidates himself and his riches.
13. But as they were unable to take the building by assault, (for it was high and large, and had battlements, and many brave men to defend it,) they proceeded to dig a passage into it.
14. The wall was eight bricks of earth thick;
but a breach was made in it by day-break ;
and the moment an opening appeared, some one from within pierced the thigh of the man that was nearest him through with an ox-spit;
1 and afterwards, by shooting showers of arrows, they rendered it unsafe even to approach.
15. As they uttered loud cries, too, and made signals with torches, Itabelius,2 with his force, came to their assistance, as well as some Assyrian heavy-armed men, and about eighty Hyrcanian cavalry, who were in the king's pay, from Coma­ nia;
and other troops, lightly armed, to the number of eight hundred, with cavalry, some from Parthenium, and others from Apollonia and the neighbouring parts.
16.
It was now time for the Greeks to consider how they should retreat;
and, taking what oxen and sheep were at hand, they drove them off, placing them with the slaves, within a hollow square, not so much because they were anxious about the booty, but lest, if they went off and left it, their retreat might appear like a flight, and the enemy might thus be ren­ dered bolder, and their own men more dispirited ;
whereas they now retired as if resolved to defend their capture.
17. But when Gongylus observed that the Greeks were but few, and those who hung upon their rear were numerous, he sallied forth himself, against the will of his mother, at the head of his own force, wishing to take a share in the action ;
Procles also, and Teuthranias, a descendant of Damaratus,3 came to his support from Halisarne.
is.
Xenophon and his party, as they were sorely harassed by the enemy's arrows and slings, and as they marched in a circle to hold their shields as a defence against the missiles, got with great difficulty across the river Caicus, nearly half of them being wounded.
19. On this oc­ casion Agasias the Stymphalian, one of the captains, was wounded, after making head the whole time against the enemy.
But they at last came off safe, with about two hundred slaves, and cattle enough for sacrifice.
20. On the following day Xenophor.
offered sacrifice, and led out his whole force in the night, with a design to go as far as possible into Lydia, in order that the Persian might not be in fear from his proximity, but be thrown off his guard.
21. But Asidates, hearing that Xenophon had again sacrificed with a view to an attack upon him, and that he would return with all his strength, went out to encamp in some villages lying close under the little town of Parthenium.
22. Here Xenophon and his troop came round upon him, and captured himself, his wife and children, his horses, and all his property;
and thus the omens of the first sacrifice were verified.
23.
They then marched back to Pergamus ;
and here Xeno­ phon had no cause to complain of the god ;
1 for the Lacedæmo­ nians, the captains, the rest of the generals, and the soldiers, all agreed that he should receive select portions of the spoil, consisting of horses, oxen, and other things;
so that be was now able even to serve a friend.
24.
Soon after, Thibron arrived and took charge of the army, and, uniting it with the rest of the Greek force, proceeded to make war upon Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus.
25.2
The governors of the king's country, as much of it as we went through, were these:
of Lydia, Artemas;
of Phrygia, Artacamas;
of Lycaonia and Cappadocia, Mithridates;
of Cilicia, Syennesis;
of Phœnicia and Arabia, Dernes;
of Syria and Assyria, Belesys;
of Babylon, Rhoparas;
of Media, Arbacas ;
of the Phasiani and Hesperitæ, Tiribazus;
(the Carduehi, the Chalybes, the Chaldæans, the Macrones, the Colchians, the Mossynocci, the Cœtæ, and the Tibareni, were independent nations;
) of Paphlagonia, Corylas ;
of the Bithy­ nians, Pharnabazus ;
and of the Thracians in Europe, Scuthes.26.
The computation of the whole journey, the ascent and descent,1 was two hundred and fifteen days'march, one thousand one hundred and fifty-five parasangs, thirty-four thousand six hundred and fifty stadia.
The length of time occupied in the ascent and descent was one year and three months.
To this sum is to he added the march from Ephesus, which is said to have occupied three days:
see Krüger, ed. maj. p. 551. But Xenophon himself (Anab. ii. 2.6) states that “the length of the journey from Ephesus in Ionia to the place where the battle was fought, was ninety-three days' march, five hundred and thirty-five para­ sangs, and sixteen thousand and fifty stadia;
while from the field of battle to Babylon the distance was said to be three hundred and sixty stadia."
Hence it follows, either that Xenophon has made a mistake in reckoning up the numbers, or that the numbers themselves have been corrupted by transcribers.
As to the dates in this table, the reader may consiilt Kriiger, ed. maj. p. 556;

Karl Koch Der Zug der Zehntausend nacb Xenophons Anabasis Leipz. 1850, p. 140, seqq Kühner.So Xenophon (Anab. v. 5. 4) saysthat " the length of the journey down the coun­ try, from the field of battle near Babylon to Cotyora, was a hundred and twenty-two day march, six hundred and twenty parasangs, and eighteen thousand six hundred stadia, occupying eight months," i.e. from September 4th, 401, to May 18th, 400.
The voyage from Cotyora to Slnope took two days, May 19th and 20th ;
the army stayed at Sinope five days, that is, till May 25th;
and two days after, May 27th, they arrived at Heraclea, From thence they proceeded to the Harbour of Calpe, situated in Bithynia, or Asiatic Thrace;
at the beginning of October they crossed over to Byzantium ;
and during December, 400, and January, 399, they were engaged in the service of the Thracian prince Seuthes.
Kühner.Xenophon (v. 5. 4) terminates the Catabasis at Cotyora.
A summary of the events that took place after the Greeks arrived at Cotyora, is subjoined.
TilE zeal and critical acumen of scholars and travellers in­ numerable, have been devoted to the elucidation of the very re­ markable journey of the Greeks under Cyrus, from Sardes, the capital of Lydia in Asia Minor, to Babylonia;
and the still more extraordinary and interesting retreat along the river Tigris by Kurdistan and Armenia to the shores of the Black Sea.
The survey of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris by the expedition under Colonel Chesney, gave, however, opportunities for investi­ gating this very interesting subject, such as had never previously presented themselves;
and these opportunities may be said to have received their complement, by the advantages which were derived from a journey in Kurdistan and Armenia, performed in 1840, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, by the writer, who, upon that occasion, followed the track of the gallant little corps, through the most intricate and difficult portions of their wander­ ings.
The result of these researches were first given to the public in a little book, published in 1844, entitled "Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks.
"
Since that time, however, further elucidations have rapidly suc­ ceeded one another, by far the most important of which are con­ tained in the great work by Colonel Chesney, " The Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris," of which the two first volumes only are yet published.
These volumes, how­ ever, comprise all that refers to the expedition of Cyrus, and con­ tain an immense mass of matter corroborative or corrective of what has been before published.
The brilliant discoveries of Layard in Assyria, and the not less valuable and important philological researches of Colonel Rawlinson, have also, during the lapse of the last ten years, brought a flood of light to bear upon the past history and con­ dition of tne populations that dwelt upon the banks of the Eu. phrates and the Tigris, which are not without their intimate bear­ ings upon the narrative left to us by the Athenian historian and commander.
Several classical scholars have also contributed their share of new and valuable critical inquiries;
among the most important of which is a correction made by Professor Maiden, and published in the Classical Museum, (No. vii. p. 36, et seq.,) of the generally ac­ cepted version of the passage which occurs in the Anabasis, (iv. 6. 4,) and which has been hitherto read as, After this they marched seven days' marches, at the rate of five parasangs a day, to the river Phasis," but which, according to Professor Malden, must be read as along the river Phasis.
There is no real ambiguity, Pro­ fessor Malden avers, in the meaning of παρα in such a context.
The effect which such a correction of seven marches has upon that portion of the Katabasis which refers to Armenia is consider­ able.
The number of marches between the Euphrates and the Phasis or Araxes, is reduced to seven, or by one-half what was previously supposed, and this important correction proportion­ ately affects the subsequent portion of the route.
The commentary or exposition now offered to the public is therefore just as much a commentary on the "Travels in tie Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks," as it is on those works which preceded it, and on those inquiries and speculations which have been entertained since.
It is by no means, however, sup­ posed to carry the subject out of the domain of further inquiry:
milch remains to be done before all the questions connected with this most perplexing subject can receive a complete and satisfactory solution.
SARDES.
—Leaving his relatives and friends in charge of the governments of Lydia, Phrygia, and Ionia, Cyrus is described as commencing his march from Sardes or Sardis in April, displaying, as Colonel Chesney remarks, admirable judgment in taking the more circuitous route along the great plains and through the prin­ cipal cities of Asia Minor, in preference to that by which Xerxes advanced through Cappadocia ;
since it gave him the support of his fleet, by which lie could receive supplies and reinforcements from time to time, besides having a fair chance of concealing for a longer period his bold design.
The capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia was situated a the foot of Mount Tmolus, in a fine plain watered by the river Pactolus, of gold-bearing celebrity.
It was once a great and flour­ ishing city, and from its wealth and importance was the object of much cupidity and of many sieges.
When taken by Cyrus the Great, under Crœsus, its last king, who has become proverbial for his riches, Sardes was one of the most splendid and opulent cities of the East.
After their victory over Antiochus it passed to the Romans, under whom it rapidly declined in rank and importance.
In the time of Tiberius it was destroyed by an earthquake, but was rebuilt by order of the emperor.
The inhabitants of Sardes bore an ill repute among the ancients for their voluptuous habits of life.
Hence, perhaps, the point of the phrase in the Apocalyptic message to the city,—" Thou hast a few names, even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments."
(Rev. iii. 4.) The place that Sardes holds in this message, as one of the " seven churches of Asia," is the source of the peculiar in­ terest with which the Christian reader regards it.
Successive sieges and earthquakes, and the ravages of Saracens and Turks, have reduced this once flourishing city to a heap of ruins, presenting, however, many remains of its former splendour.
When visited by W. J. Hamilton in 1836, with the exception of a few black Yuruk tents, the only habitation was that of a Greek miller, who had taken advantage of one of the streams which flow past the Acropolis, to turn the wheel of his mill.
The principal ruin is that of the Acropolis, situated on the top of a crumbling hill.
The ruin is, however, itself made up of an­ cient fragments, the walls and 'gateway of the fortress being, ac­ cording to Hamilton, probably Byzantine, and there being no traces of walls of Hellenic construction.
Two gigantic Ionic columns, with other huge fragments, mark the site of the temple of Cybele.
There are also remains of a Roman theatre, but the marble seats, the proscenium, and scena, are all gone:
also of a stadium, the northern side of which has been artificially formed by a wall sup­ ported on arches running along the side of the hill.
There are also remains of two early Christian churches, one of which has been too hastily concluded by travellers to have been the church of Sardis to which allusion is made in the Apocalypse;
but besides that tho expression can only have referred to the community of Christians then established, the nature of the structure shows that its date must have been at least posterior to the overthrow of the Pagan religion and the destruction of the temples towards the end of the fourth century.
Many other remains are scattered over the area of the ancient town;
amongst which the most remarkable is the so-called Gerusia, situated near the western limits of the city, partly built of brick and partly of stone, but of a late period;
while to the west of these two walls are the massive marble fragments of another building, apparently of much older date.
A countless number of sepulchral hillocks beyond the Hermus, heighten the desolateness of a spot which the multitudes lying there once made busy by their living presence and pursuits..
MAEANDER.
—The direction of Cyrus' march appears to have been parallel to the Cogamus, and having made in three days twenty-two parasangs, he arrived at the river Maeander, which he passed on a bridge of seven boats, probably above the junction of the Lycus.
The Maeander was celebrated in classic poetry for its tortuousness, whence our term—meandering.
Ovid, in describing the Minotaur's labyrinth, compares it with the Maeander.
As soft Macander's wanton current plays, When through the Phrygian fields it loosely strays;
Backward and forward rolls the dimpled tide, Seeming at once two different ways to glide:
While circling streams their former banks survey, And waters past succeeding waters see;
Now floating to the sea with downward course, Now pointing upward to its ancient source.
It may be remarked here, that considering the stadium and para­ sang as fragments of the earth's true meridional circumference, as more particularly developed by Colonel Jervis, the amount admit­ ted in the Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks, was G07.G2977 English feet for the first, 5468.668 English feet for the second.
The principle upon which this estimate is founded is this:
that the Jewish itinerary measure was the Parsah of 3 Bereh;
each Bereh of 7½ Khebel, or 3000 measures.
The Parsah, correspond­ ing to the Greek παρασγγα, or the Persian Farsakh, the Bereh to the Turkish Beré, and the Khebel, or rope, to the stadium.
The Jewish Bereh was the 24,000th of the earth's true meridional cir­ cumference;
the fundamental measure, therefore, the 72,000,000th of the meridional circumference, which Colonel Jervis having com­ puted to the ellipticity from a comparative summary of the results of the Lapland, British, French, and Indian measurements, is or 21.8724876 inches English.
Now the element is to the common element, of all those itinerary measures alluded to by Eratosthenes, Cleomedes, Posidonins, and othei historians and other writers, whether Egyptian, Jewish, Greek, Roman, or the earlier Arabian, as 5 to 9,—that is, they were, one and all, the 40,000,000th, the Jewish the 72,000,000th, of the earth's meridional circumference;
and hence the true length of the Roman and Greek foot, and cubit, and stadium may be immedi­ ately inferred.
For the Jewish Parsah being the eight-thousandth part of the circumference, or 24,000 such measures above stated, was 5468.668 feet English.
The Bereh, 1-24,000th of the meridional circumfer­ ence, or 3000 such measures, was 5468.668 feet English.
The Khebel, or stadium =729.15584 feet English (the side,-i. e. the length and breadth, of the greatest pyramid, or that of Cheops).
One-ninth of this was the Greek and Roman stadium, 607,62977 feet English;
the 600th part, the true Greek foot, 12.156 English inches;
the 6'25th part, the true Roman foot, 11.67 English inches.
The Greek and Roman cubits respectively 18.2289 and 17.4997 English inches.
Colonel Jervis felt satisfied that these data would serve to clear up many difficulties in the writings of Herodotus, Xenophon, Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus, Curtius, and others, whose apparent discrepancies he believed to be due rather to our misapprehen sion, than to any obscurity or inaccuracy in those authors.
For either we must suppose the earth to have altered in dimension, the situation of remarkable places to have changed, or the ancients to have been wholly devoid of intelligence;
or we must resort to the conclusion that the misapprehension of these difficulties is rather to be sought for in our own want of patient consideration.
Colonel Chesney has proceeded upon a much more latitudina­ rian system. " The modern farsang or barsakh of Persia," he says in his great work, "The Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris," vol. ii. p. 207, "varies according to the nature of the ground, from three and a half to four English miles per hour;
and being always calculated for mules, or good horses, under favourable circumstances, it frequently exceeds four miles.
The ancient parasang appears to have been fixed at thirty stadia, which at 202.84 yards would give three geographical miles.
But this being also a road measure, it no doubt varied as at present, and was regulated according to the nature of the country ;
and for­ tunately we have the means of ascertaining this difference with considerable precision.
A line drawn along the map so as to touch the river, at short distances, from Thapsacus to the river Araxes, is about one hundred and five miles, which for the fifty parasangs of Xenophon, give 2.10 geographical miles each.
By the route followed from Sardis to Thapsacus, it is eight hundred and fifty- three geographical miles, which will give 2.608 geographical miles for each of the three hundred and twenty-seven parasangs.
Again, from Thapsacus to the mounds of Muhammad, thirty-six miles from Babylon, where, for the sake of water, the route constantly follows and almost touches the river Euphrates, it is four hundred and twelve geographical miles, thus giving 1.98 geographical miles for each of the two hundred and eight parasangs, or 2.294 geogra­ phical miles for the mean of both.""
This scarcely differs from the result obtained by the laborious and discriminating geographer, Major Rennell, who, without our present advantages, estimated the parasang at 2.25 miles;
which, in fact, approaches an average of the whole march of Cyrus.
We find that the distance from Sardis to Cunaxa, or the mounds of Muhammad, cannot be much under or over 1265 geographical miles, making 2.364 geographical miles for each of the five hun­ dred and thirty-five parasangs given by Xenophon between those places.
"
"From the preceding calculations," continues Colonel Chesney, " it appears that we are warranted in taking the average value of the parasang at 2.608 geographical miles throughout the march to Thapsacus, and at 1.98, or almost two miles, from thence to Cu­ naxa;
but subsequently it is less than two geographical miles.
The greater speed in the first part of the march, was the natural consequence of moving during the most favourable season of the year, (April and May,) with the additional advantage of roads.
The want of the latter must have been a serious impediment to the carriages during the next fortnight;
for, although the marches were pressing, the heavy-armed men, with their weapons, would have been greatly retarded, by the almost insupportable heat of the summer months ;
in the subsequent retreat, the mountains, the rivers, and unknown tracts, as well as the snow on the ground, must have caused still greater retardations."
This is a view of the subject which I have also been obliged to adopt in the present commentary.
COLOSSAE.
—Advancing from the Maeander through Phrygia, the army made in one day's march eight parasangs, to Colossae, described as being at that time a large city, rich and well inhabit­ ed.
This city had indeed been previously noticed by Herodotus, (vii. 30,) as a large city of Phrygia oil the Lycus, a tributary to the Maeander.
Xerxes, on his march to Sardis, B. C. 481, reached Colossae after leaving Anaua.
Colossae had become a place of comparatively little importance in Strabo's time.
A Christian church was formed here very early, probably by Epaphras, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, to whom Paul, who docs not appear to have ever visited Colossac in person, addressed an Epistle from Rome.
Not long after, the town was, together with Laodicea and Hierapolis, destroyed by an earthquake.
This, ac­ cording to Eusebius, was in the ninth year of Nero;
but the town must have been immediately rebuilt, for in his twelfth year it continued to be named as a flourishing place.
In the middle ages there arose near it a town called Chonae, and Colossae dis­ appeared.
Chonae was the birth-place of Nicetas Choniates, one of the Byzantine historians.
Arundel (Asia Minor, vol. ii. p. 139, &c.) supposed that the ruins at the modern Khonos, which corresponds to Chonac, were also the ruins of Colossac, but Hamilton (Res. &c. i. 508) found exten­ sive ruins of an ancient city about three miles north of Khonos, which appear from certain hydrographical peculiarities alluded to by Herodotus and Pliny, and verified by Hamilton, to be undoubt­ edly the site of Colossac.
CELAENAE.-From Colossac Cyrus made in three days' march twenty parasangs, to Cclacnae, a city of Phrygia, large, rich, and well inhabited, and where was the fortified palace of Xerxes, the palace of Cyrus, the hunting park, and the cave of Marsyas.
He­ rodotus speaks of Celaenae in describing the march of Xerxes to Sardes.
He says (vii. 26) that the sources of the Maeander are here, and those of a stream not less than the Maeander:
it is named Catarrhaetes, and rising in the Agora of Celaenae, flows into the Macander.
The Cattarrhactes of Herodotus is clearly the Marsyas of Xenophon.
Hamilton, who visited the source at a place called Deenair or Dinair, describes it as a considerable stream of water gushing out with great rapidity at the base of a rocky cliff.
It appeared as if it had formerly risen in the centre of a great cavern, and that the surrounding rocks had fallen in from the cliffs above.
In Livy's description (xxxviii. 13) the Maeander rises in the acropolis of Celaenae, and runs through the middle of the city;
and the Marsyas, which rises not far from the sources of the Macander, joins the same river.
Leake thinks that it clearly appears from Strabo that both the rivers (Marsyas and Macander) ran through Celaenae, and that they united in the suburb which afterwards became the new city Apameia.
It did not appear to Hamilton that the cliff above the source of the Marsyas could be the acropolis of Celaenae, which Alexander con­ sidered to be impregnable, and came to terms with the inhabitants.
He supposes that the acropolis may have been further to the N. E., a lofty hill about a mile from the ravine of the Marsyas.
The town of Apameia Cibotus, which was built by Antiochus Soter out of the ruins of Celaenae, was positively stated by Strabo to lie at the source of the Marsyas.
Arundel was the first who clearly saw that Apameia must be at Dinair;
and his conclusions were confirmed by a Latin inscription which he found record­ ing the erection of a monument by the merchants residing there.
Leake has also collected the ancient testimonies as to Apa­ meia.
Hamilton investigated the hydrographic and other fea­ tures of the place most carefully, and obtained several Greek inscriptions from the same neighbourhood.
PELTAE—From Celaenae Cyrus made in two days' march ten parasangs, and arrived at Peltae, a city well inhabited.
Peltac, or rather the Peltenus Campus, has been identified with the plain now called Baklan uvah, which is watered by the Macander.
Hamilton (ii. 163) describes himself as much struck with its level extent, and capabilities for manoeuvring cavalry.
It may be, he says, the plain on which Cyrus reviewed his troops, and celebrated martial games after leaving Apameia:
* for although he was marching to the east, it appears that he did not proceed thither direct;
as Xenophon says that lie passed through Ceramorum Agora, a town on the frontiers of Mysia, twenty-two parasangs from Apameia, which must have been to the N. N. W.Colonel Chesney (ii. 206) attributes these two retrograde marches to the necessity of rounding a difficult portion of the Taurus.
Hamilton met on this plain burial-grounds with large blocks of stone, and broken columns, on one of which he found a mutilated inscription ;
but a whole month, he says, dedicated to the examina­ tion of the numerous villages and burial-grounds which fill this extensive plain, and which increase in number as you advance eastwards, would not be too much to determine the name and sites of the ancient towns which once flourished here.
CERAMON OR CERAMORUM AGORA.
—After halting three days to celebrate the Lupercalian sacrifice, Cyrus advanced twelve para­ sangs to Ccramon Agora, (the market of the Cramians,) the site of which, according to the back distances from Koniyah, would be a little east of the actual town of Ushak, but allowing for variation in the value of the parasang, at Ushak itself.
Pliny having noticed a town called Carinae in Phrygia, Cramer conjectured that this might be the Ceramon Agora.
It has also been supposed to be the same as the Caris or Carides of Stephanus, but that name corresponds to the Carina of Pliny, or Caria, as it perhaps should be read.
Hamilton (ii. 204) describes Ushak as a place of considerable commerce and traffic in the present day;
many of the high roads of Asia Minor passing through it.
He also adds, that to a person going to Mysia from Apameia, (Celaenae,) and supposing, as Strabo says, that Mysia extended to Ghiadiz, (Kadi,) Ushak would be the last town through which lie would pass before entering Mysia, from which it is separated by a mountainous and uninhabited district.
PLAIN OF CAYSTRUS.
—From the market of the Cramians, Cy­ rus made in three days᾽ march 30 parasangs, and arrived at a well-peopled city, called the Plain of Caystrus.
(Caystri Campus.)
It has been previously observed, that the site of the market of the Cramians has been determined by back distances, owing to the difficulty entailed by Cyrus having deviated from his course at Celaenae.
Thus the march from Celaenae to Peltae is 10 para­ sangs;
from Peltae to Ccramon Agora 12 parasangs;
and from Ceramon Agora to the Plain of Caystrus, was 30 parasangs.
From the Plain of Caystrus, Cyrus marched 10 parasangs to Thymbrium, then tO to Tyraeum, and then 20 to Iconium, the last city in Phrygia in the direction of his march;
for after leaving Iconium, he entered Cappadocia.
Iconium is Koniyah, a position well known.
Celaenae may also be considered as a well-determined position.
Now the march of Cyrus from Celaenae to Iconium was 92 parasangs.
The angle thus obtained drives the site of the mar­ ret of the Cramians more or less to the N. W. of Ushak, according to the estimate taken of the parasang, 2.6 geog.
miles according to Chesney, 2.455 geog.
miles according to Hamilton, or 3 according to Colonel Jervis, but I have with others adopted the site of Ushak, as the most likely.
This question has been made the subject of some critical re­ marks by Mr. Long in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geo­ graphy, which I willingly give insertion to here."
Two recent attempts,” Mr. Long writes, " have been made to fix the places between Celaenae and Iconium, one by Mr. Hamil­ ton,(Researches, &c., vol. ii. p. 198,) and another by Mr. Ainsworth (Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand, &c., p. 24).
The ex­ amination of these two explanations cannot be made here for want of space.
But it is impossible to identify with certainty positions on a line of road where distances only are given, and we find no corresponding names to guide us.
Mr. Hamilton supposes that the Caystri Campus may be near the village of Chai Kieui, ' and near the banks of the Eber Ghieulin the extensive plain between that village and Polybotum.'
Chai Kieui is in about 38° 40' N. lat.""Mr. Ainsworth places the Caystri Campus farther west, at a place called Surmeneh, ‘a high and arid upland, as its ancient name designates,' which is traversed by an insignificant tributary to the Eber Göl,’ Mr. Hamilton's Eber Ghieul.
The neighbourhood of Surmeneh, abounds in ancient remains ;
but Chai Kieui is an insig­ nificant place, without ruins."
"Both Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ainsworth, however, agree in fixing the Caystri Campus in the basin of this river, the Eber Ghieul, and so far the conclusion may be accepted as probable.
But the exact site of the place cannot be determined without further evi­ dence.
Cyrus stayed at Caystri Campus five days, and he certainly would not stay with his troops five days in a high and arid upland.
As the plain was called the Plain of Cayster, we may assume that there was a river Cayster, where Cyrus halted.
One of Mr. Ainsworth'a objections to Mr. Hamilton's conclusion is altogether unfounded.
He says that the plain which Mr. Hamilton chooses as the site of the Caystri Campus is 'an extensive plain, but very marshy, being in one part occupied by a perpetual and large lake, called Eber GoI, and most unlikely at any season of the year to present the arid and burnt appearance which could have led the Greeks to call it Caustron or Caystrus, the burnt or barren plain.'
But the word Caystrus could not mean burnt, and Stephanus is guilty of originating this mistake.
It means no male a burnt plain here than it does when applied to the plain above Ephesus.
Both were watery places ;
one we know to be so, and the other we may with great probability conclude to be.
"As it appears that I was misled in the reading of Cayster, I do not wish to insist upon this special identification in the “ Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks."
I may however be permitted to ob­ serve, that the identification was not solely founded upon the cir­ cumstance of Surmanah being a dry upland.
It was also founded on back distances from Iconium 20 parasangs to Tyriaeum, 10 to Thymbrium, and tO to the plain of Caystrus, or 120 geographical miles.
Eber Göl, or Ibar Gül, being at a less distance.
There is a stream of water at Surmanah as well as at Chai Kiui, and Xenophon tells us there was also in Cyrus's time a well-peopled city.
So that it was not because it was an arid plain that it can be also shown not to have been a fit place for a delay of five days.
I may also add that so marshy is the plain of Bulavadin, that the road from the N. W. to that town has to be carried in great part over a raised causeway.
Hamilton (ii. 177) describes Surmanah as “a rich mine of antiquarian treasures," as is also the case with Afyum Kara Hissar in the same neighbourhood, which he looks upon as the site of ancient Synnada.
The same observing traveller however makes mention of no ruins at or near Chai Kiui, which he also identifies with the Holmi of Strabo.
THYMBRIUM.
—During a halt of five days on the plain of Cays­ trus, Cyrus received Epyaxa, the queen of Cilicia ;
whose mysteri­ oils visit and opportune supply of treasure enabled him to appease the Greeks by giving them three months’ arrears of pity.
Ac­ companied by Epyaxa, lie advanced thence, ten parasangs, to Thymbrium, on the borders of Lycaonia.
Estimating the parasang at three geographical miles, I have iden­ tified Thymbrium with the modern Ishakli, reckoning back from leonium.
Even at the reduced estimate of Hamilton, ten parasangs, equal upon his scale to 24 or 25 geographic miles, measured from the site of Ilghun, or from the hot baths, brings us beyond Philo­ melium at Ak-Shahir, and nearly half way between that town and the fountain of Ulu Bunar Darbund.
Hamilton describes that fountain as only four or five miles from Ak-Shahir, whereas I was upwards of two hours travelling from the one to the other.
Colo­ net Chesney (ii. 208) places Thymbrium " at or a little south-east­ ward of the present town of Ak-Shahir,”The expression used by Xenophon, ἐνταυ̃θα ην παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν, would certainly appear to denote that lie passed the fountain of Midas on the road to Thymbrium, although Spelman translates it "
Here was a fountain near the road, called the fountain of Midas."
"There seems, therefore,” says Hamilton, (ii. 202,) “every reason for placing Thymbrium at the foot of Sultan Tagh, between the fountain of Midas and Ak Shehr (Shahir), if indeed it be not an an older name for Philomelium itself."
There certainly seems, however, taking the reduced estimate of the value of the parasang adopted by Hamilton and Colonel Chesney, still to remain more reasons for approximating the site of Thymbrium to the fountain of Midas than to Ak-Shahir, only that towns have mostly sue­ ceeded to one another at the same site.
The road, it is to be re­ marked upon this assumption of the value of the parasang, pre­ sents few difficulties, and it improves still more on approaching Iconium.
I can understand the parasang covering little plane surface in the passes of Kurdistan or the snows of Armenia, but I cannot help feeling, with Colonel Jervis, that to suppose a varying estimate of that value on the plains of Asia Minor, argues a great want of intelligence on the part of the ancients, and reduces them to the semi-barbarous position of the modern Turk and Persian, who, reckoning by time and not by distance, leave it impossible, without actual investigation, to determine from such data the geographical position of places.
It is obvious, therefore, in the instances of Peltae, Ceramon Agora, Caystri Campus, Thymbrium, and Tyriaeum, where we have only distances to go upon, we must remain more or less in a state of uncertainty as to their true posié tions.
The fountain of Midas helps to throw some additional light upon the positioning of Thymbrium, that of Tyriaeum is confirmed by Strabo, and Ushak, as representing the market of the Cramians, remains to the present day a place of considerable traffic and commerce, and a place of meeting of high roads.
These circumstances must be taken into consideration in determining the position of the sites noticed by Xenophon between Celacnae and Iconium, two known positions.
TYRIAEUM.
—Cyrus made in two days' march ten parasangs, and arrived at Tyriaeum, a populous town.
Hamilton and Colonel Chesney, upon the evaluation of distances before alluded to, think that Tyriaeum is probably represented by Ilghun.
I sought for the site at Arkut Khan, but without wishing to put much stress upon so indefinite a point.
Neither Hamilton nor myself saw any remains of ancient times at either Arkut Khan or Ilghun.
There is this to be said of Ilghun, that there is beyond that town a plain much better adapted for the review of the Greek and Bar­ barian forces described by Xenophon, than at Arkut Khan, where the surface of the soil is broken up by slabs of horizontal lime­ stone.
Hamilton also remarks that their identification is confirm­ ed by Strabo's account of the great road from Ephesus to Mazaca ;
for he clearly places Tyriaeum between Philomelium and Laodicea, and near the borders of Lycaonia.
Another argument in favour of this site is, that Strabo states that Holmi was at the commence­ ment of Phrygia Paroreius, which would therefore be at the west­ ern extremity of Sultan Tagh, and he gives the distance from Holmi to Tyriaeum as rather more than 500 stadia.
Now the distance from the commencement of the Sultan Tagh to Ilghun is 55 miles, and from Chai Kiui, which Hamilton identifies with Hol­ mi, just about 50 miles, or 500 stadia.
ICONIOM.
—From Tyriacum
Cyrus made in three days march twenty parasangs, and came to Iconium, the last city of Phrygia.
This, as one of the most ancient and remarkable cities of Asia Minor, requires little notice at our hands.
Pliny calls it urbs cele­ berrima Iconium.
Strabo speaks of it as small but well built.
When visited by the apostle Paul in A. D. 45, it is described as inhabited by a great multitude of Jews and Greeks.
(Acts xiv. 1.) The most remarkable era in the history of Iconium is that of the Seljukian Turks or Tartars, a branch of whom founded a dynasty at Koniyah in Karaman, before the rise of the Osmanli Turks.
Modern Koniyah is still a large town, the seat of a pasha, and of a Greek metropolitan, and it contains many interesting relies of olden times.
Among the most remarkable of which is the mosque built by Sultan Aladin, the mausoleum of Hazrit Mavlana, the founder of the Mavlani darvishes or dervishes, the old Turkish prison, and the Injami Minareh Jami, "the mosque with the minarets towering to the stars."
LYCAONIA.—From Iconium, Cyrus made in five days' march thirty parasangs through Lycaonia, which being an enemy's country, he gave the Greeks leave to plunder it.
From hence he sent the Cilician queen into Cilicia the shortest way.
Now as the next place reached by Cyrus—Dana—is a well-known site, we have only to mark off thirty parasangs from Iconium and twenty­ live to Dana on the map, and the point of intersection will be the spot where Cyrus parted with the queen of Cilicia.
This spot may therefore, if Cyrus kept a northern road, have been at or near the now small town of Kara Bunar, “ the Black Spring;
” or if gallantry led him to take a southerly route, the part­ ing may have taken place at or near Tchurla or Churla, north of Karaman, near which Hamilton found many ruins of ancient sites, notoriously those of Lystra and Derbe, whither Paul and Barna­ has fled after their expulsion from Iconium.
I am most inclined to the latter view of the case.
From this point Epyaxa returned to her husband Syennesis, the king of Cilicia, across the Taurus by Kizil Chasmah, Alan Buzuk, Mazatli, Soli or Pompeiopolis, and onward to Tarsus.
Colonel Chesney remarks upon this incident in the march of Cyrus, that it may be inferred from what subsequently passed in Cilicia, that the object of this remarkable mission and the timely supply of treasure, was to induce Cyrus to take another route, that Syennesis might not be embroiled with Artaxerxes, by permitting the march through his territory;
and it is not improbable that, from her peculiar intimacy with the prince, the queen believed she had been successful.
Cyrus, however, availed himself of her re­ turn, to send a body of Greeks under Menon, nominally as a guard of honour, but in reality to turn the Cilician Gates, the only pass which was practicable for an army through this part of Taurus.
Two companies, amounting to one hundred heavy-armed men, were lost in this undertaking, and the rest, arriving before the main body of the army, and resenting the loss of their companions plundered both the city of Tarsus and the palace that stood thereDANA.
—Cyrus, with the rest of his army, moved on through Cappadocia, and, in four days' march, made five and twenty para­ sangs to Dana, a large and rich city, well inhabited.
Tyana was well known to all antiquity, not only as the residence of Apollonius and the site of a temple of the Asbamaean Jupiter, but also as the town nearest to the Cilician Gates.
Strabo says it was also called Eusebia ad Taurum, and that it was built on a mound raised by Semiramis, or called Semiramis, probably a heap of Assyrian ruins.
Cellarius argued that Δανα was a contraction made by the copyists for Τύανα, and the correction thus made has been strengthened by subsequent inquiry.
Thus Hamilton was enabled to identify the ruins at the site now called Kiz Hissar, "Girls Castle," or Kilis Hissar, “ Castle of the Church," with Tyana, by the existence there of a small lake or pool which presents the peculiar phenomenon ascribed to the fountain of Asmabaeus sacred to Jupiter by Ammianus Marcelli­ nus, of never overflowing its banks, and of bubbling up like a boiling cauldron as described by Philostratus.
(Res. ii. 303.)
An identification which is further confirmed by the mound on which the ruins stand.
The site of Tyana being then determined, the distance from Iconium, the situation of the town at the entrance of the pass of Taurus, and its olden celebrity, point it out as the Dana of Xeno­ phon, or as Cellarius more probably opines, that Dana was a mis­ cript for Tyana.CILlClAN GATES.
—Cyrus is described as preparing at Dana to penetrate into Cilicia ;
the entrance was broad enough for a cha­ riot to pass, very steep, and inaccessible to an army if there had been any opposition;
and Syennesis was said to have possessed himself of the eminences, in order to guard the pass;
for which rea­ son, Cyrus stayed one day in the plain.
The day after, news was brought by a messenger that Syennesis had quitted the eminences, upon information that both Menon's army were in Cilicia, within the mountains, and also that Tamos was sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia with the galleys that belonged to the Lacedæmonians and to Cyrus, who immediately marched up to the mountains without opposition, and made himself master of the tents, in which the Cilicians lay to oppose his passage.
The Cilician Gates, called by the Turks in the present day, Kulak Bughaz, constitute perhaps one of the most remarkable and picturesque mountain-passes in the world.
Colonel Chesney adds to this, (ii. 210,) that it is one of the longest and most difli­ cult passes in the world.
The road through the pass ascends more or less across a wild country from Harakli to Kulu Kushla, a distance of about 28 miles, and up to which point the rivulets are tributary to the Ak Güli, or white lakes, the outlet of which may be justly suspected to be a subterranean channel, having a cavernous exit towards the plain of Adana.
Beyond Kulu Kushla, or “ place of winds," the road descends by a narrow glen into the valley of a tributary to the Sihun or Sa­ rus.
This valley is wooded, and bordered by precipitous clifls.
At a place called Shiftla Khan, some nine or ten miles beyond Kulu Kushla, two valleys meet to form a third, which is an open, wooded, pleasant vale, that leads through the very heart of the Bulghar Tagh.
The road leaves this picturesque valley at a distance of eight or nine miles, to ascend in a south-westerly direction, an open valley bearing a small tributary to the Sihun, which is left behind flow­ ing to the south-east, till an upland is reached, where the celebrated defences of the Egyptians were situated.
Immediately beyond this, a rivulet, flowing in a southerly direction, leads to a pass in the mountains so narrow as to be just broad enough, as Xenophon describes it, for a chariot to pass—if disencumbered of fallen rocks.
This pass is the true Kulak Bughaz;
high precipitous cliffs tower up on both sides;
on the summit of one of which are the remains of a castle with round towers, and a tablet, which once bore an in­ scription, is still to be seen on the face of a large mass of detached rock that lies in the rivulet.
Beyond this, two roads lead, one over hills by Mizarluk, “ the place of graves," chiefly sepulchral grottoes, to Tarsus;
the other along open winding wooded vales, and at first rocky, then low rounded undulating hills, to the great plain of Adana, which is but slightly elevated above the level of the waters of the Mediterranean.
PLAINS OF CILICIA.
—Cyrus is described by his historian as de­ scending from the mountains into a large and beautiful plain, well watered, and full of all sorts of trees and vines;
abounding in sesame, panic, millet, wheat, and barley.
The plain of Adana, as it is now called, is still remarkable for its beauty and fertility.
Portions, especially in the upper parts and around Anazarba, are merely meadow land, or covered with greensward, with, in the least watered portions, a good deal of mimosa, and here and there a lonely dark-leaved carob-tree, a great feature in the scenery.
But a considerable portion of the plain is cultivated, furnishing sesame, panic, millet, wheat, and barley, as in olden time, as also rice, cotton, and sugar-cane, since introduced.
Near Tarsus, or the valley of the Cydnus, there is a good deal of wood, and at Adana a few date-trees speak volumes of a change of climate.
The flocks of small bustards and the numerous gazelles impart another peculiar feature to the plain, as do also its rocky castle-bearing knolls in another direction.
This plain is described by Xenophon as surrounded by a strong and high ridge of hills.
It is, indeed, as well as the Bay of Issus, or Gulf of Alexandretta, perfectly enclosed by Taurus to the west and north, Amanus to the east, and Rhosus to the south.
TARSUS.
—Cyrus having left the mountains, he advanced through the plain, and having made five and twenty parasangs in four days' march, arrived at Tarsus, a large and rich city of Cilicia, where stood the palace of Syennesis, king of Cilicia;
having the river Cydnus running through the middle of it, which river is two hun­ dred feet in breadth.
Tarsus is a city of such great antiquity that its origin is involved in fable.
While Scripture historians affirm that the sons of Tar­ shish, the great-grandson of Noah, settled on this coast, classic mythology insists that Tarsus was built by Perseus son of Jupiter by Danae.
Hypacheans, according to Herodotus;
a colony of Ar­ gives, according to others;
it is certain that it was a city favoured by the Assyrians.
Grotefend states that after Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, had reigned twenty-five years, he extended his conquests over Asia Minor, and took up his abode in the city of Tanakan, a strong place in Etlak, by which, perhaps, Tarsus in Cilicia is meant, of the building of which by Sennacherib a fabulous account is given by Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus in the Armenian version of Eusebius.
After he had introduced into that place the worship of Astarte or Nisroch, and received tribute, he reduced the neighbouring provinces to subjection, and appointed Akharrizadon, or Assarhaddon, as king over them.
This is one of the triumphs supposed to be alluded to in the celebrated obelisk of Nimrud or Athur.
No traces exist of the statue described by Arrian as com­ memorating the building of this city and Anchiale by Sardanapa­ lus in one day.
No contribution to the history of Tarsus has been so rich in re­ suits as the publication of the 11 Lares and Penates” of Cilicia from terra cottas discovered on the spot by Mr. William Burckhardt Barker.
We have among these, evidences of Assyrian mythology, in the presence of the Assyrian Perseus, Sandon or Hercules, (Dayyad the Hunter, and the same as Nimrod,) the Assyrian Bellerophon and Pegasus, and horses of the sun.
We have evi­ dences of Egyptian mythology in representations of Isis, Osiris, Horus, Anubis, and Phre the Hawk-the Egyptian sun.
With these we have, as might be anticipated, a whole host of illustrations of the mythology of Syria and Phœnicia, of Lesser Asia, Greece, and Rome.
Tarsus was a well-known and distinguished seat of Greek philosophy and literature, and from the number of its schools and learned men, was ranked by the side of Athens and Alexan­ dria.
(Strabo, xiv. pp. 673, 674.)To the Christian, Tarsus derives its greatest Interest from being the birth-place of the apostle Paul.
Augustus made Tarsus free
This seems to have implied the privilege of being governed by its own laws and magistrates, with freedom from tribute, but did not confer the jus coloniarum, nor the jus civitatis:
and it was not therefore, as usually supposed, on this account that Paul enjoyed the privilege of Roman citizenship.
Tarsus, indeed, eventually did become a Roman colony, which gave to the inhabitants this privilege;
but this was not till long after the time of Paul.
We thus find that the Roman tribune at Jerusalem ordered Paul to be scourged, though he knew he was a native of Tarsus, but desisted on learning that he was a Roman citizen.
(Acts ix.
It ;
xxi. 39;
xxii. 24, 27.)In the time of Abulfeda, that is, towards the end of the thir­ teenth and beginning of the fourteenth century, Tarsus was still large and surrounded by a double wall, and it was chiefly inhabited by Armenian Christians.
Tarsus has always been a city of considerable commercial im­ portance.
Albertus Aquensis speaks of three thousand ships sail­ ing from the port of Tarsus, and even in the present day a much greater extent might be given to the commerce and the mercantile and agricultural resources of the place.
CYDNUS.
—The river Cydnus which flows through Tarsus, do­ riving its waters from the snows of Taurus at no very great distance from the city itself, are extremely cold, and bear an evil repute since the days of Alexander the Great.
Malaria prevails however to a great extent in the city, quite independent of any more im­ mediate contact with its waters.
CASTLE OF NIMRUD.—
Tarsus is described by Xenophon as abandoned by its inhabitants, who, with Syennesis, fled to a fast­ ness upon the mountains, those only excepted who kept the public- houses.
The fastness here alluded to has been identified with the castle of Nimrud in the adjacent mountains, partly on account of its antiquity, partly because no other likely place is known.
The castle of Nimrud has not however been visited by any competent traveller.
SOLL.
—The inhabitants of Soli and Issus, who lived near the sea, did not quit their habitations.
Issus will be noticed in due course.
Soli was a colony, according to Pomponius Mela and others, found ed by the Argives and Rhodians;
but according to Diogenes Laer­ tius, by Solon, who founded there a colony of Athenians, who gradually corrupting their own language, gave origin to the term Solœcism.
This city was afterwards put under contribution by Alexander and devastated by Tigranes, and Pompey confined to the same locality the pirates who troubled the neighbouring seas, and gave the place his own name—Pompeiopolis.
The ruins of the ancient city still exist near a place now called Aski Shahir, "the old city," near Mazatli on the coast.
They have been minutely described by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort in his Karamania (pp. 246—259, et scq.).
Many additions have been made to these descriptions in Mr. W. B. Barker's work be­ fore alluded to,“ Lares and Penates :
or, Cilicia and its Gorernors” (p. 130 et seq.).
A plan and description of the ruins by Captain Prissick are also to be found, in Dr. Holt Yates' “Modern His­ tory and Condition of Egypt."
RIVER PSARUS.
—Cyrus is described as making from Tarsus, in two days' march, ten parasangs to the river Psarus, which therefore corresponds to the river of Adana, now called Sihun, or Saihun, to distinguish it from its neighbour the Pyramus, called Jihun, or Jaihun, just as the Oxus or Amu of the Turks and Tartars is called Jihun to distinguish it from the Jaxartes, Sir Darah, or head valley, of the Turks, the Sihun of the Arabs.
Jihun is the Arabic corruption for the Hebrew Gihon, the name of one of the rivers of Paradise.
This river is, by my own admeasurements, three hundred and twenty-five feet wide at Adana.
My idea of the distance by road from Tarsus to Adana corresponds more closely to the evaluation of 3 geographical miles to the parasang than of 2½ miles.
Colonel Chesney (ii. 210) himself says it is rather more than twenty-nine miles between the two places.
RIVER PYRAMUS.
—From the Psarus, Cyrus made, in one day's march, five parasangs to the river Pyramus, which was a stadium in width.
The distance here between two well-established points is also at the rate of 3 geographical miles to the parasang.
From whatever point the Greeks crossed the Sihun there would be 15 geographical miles of nearly level plain to reach the Jihun or Jaihun, as the Pyramus is now called.“
The width given by Xenophon," says “ Colonel Chesney, indi­ cates that the passage of the Psarus was effected somewhere about the place now occupied by the city of Adana, and that of the Pyra­ mus in the vicinity of the present town of Mallus or Misis;
and neither of the rivers being fordable, it may be presumed that they were, as in the case of the Maeander, crossed on some kind of tem­ porary bridge.
"Issi, or ISSUS.
—From the river Pyramus Cyrus advanced in two days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to Issi, the last city in Cilicia, situate upon the sea-coast, a populous, large, and rich place.
We are here placed in the dilemma of diminishing the value of the parasang, over a country presenting no particular difficulties, or of supposing, as I have done in the “ Travels in the Track," &c., that Cyrus forded the river in its lower parts, and at a time when its embouchure was at Kara Tash.
This would have taken them across the plain of Ayas, ancient Campus Alieus, by which Philotas, as recorded by Arrian, led the horse, on the occasion of the ad­ vance of the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, and which would give forty-five miles between the Pyramus and Issus, whilst from Misis there is only thirty-three or thirty-four miles.
I do not wish however to lay particular stress upon this view of the case, especially since all other commentators now agree in varying the value of the parasang according to the nature of the ground, and there are on the road from Misis to Issus two ranges of hills to cross.
The first the Jibal an Nur, or mountain of light, presents a little pass that would present obstacles to chariots;
the second also presents a narrow pass, where is the ancient Cyclopean arch, called the Iron gate, or the Black gate, and which corresponds to the Amanian gates with a station, (the latter represented by the ruins at Matakh,) and a further detour is occasioned by the marshes at the end of the plain, on which are situated the ruins of Epiphanea, originally called Oeniandos and Castabala.
These two sites are determined from the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary, and the Theodosian Tables.
The latter place, Epiphanea, 30 M. P. from Anazarbas, and the same distance from Alexandria ad Issuni, now Iskandarun or Alexandretta.
The positioning of Issus gave much more trouble, and involved the careful discussion of the historians of Alexander as compared with Cicero and other accessible authorities.
All the circum­ stances of the case pointed however tolerably satisfactorily to a great extent of ruins scattered over the plain, north of the Dali- chai, or mad river, as the Pinarus is now called.
The only point not satisfactorily cleared up was the position of the altars of Alexander.
It has been suggested that these may be the ruin called Jonas'
Pillars, a point which Alexander had reached before he heard that Darius had crossed the Amanus in his rear, and from whence he returned to engage in the battle of Issus, so fatal to the Persian hosts.
Quintus Curtius said that these altars were erected on the banks of the Pinarus, but Pliny describes the Domitae or altars as between Amanus and Rhosus, which would point to the locality here suggested.
Another difficulty remains with regard to Nikopolis, which Stephanus says was a name given to Issus after the great battle fought there by the Macedonians, but Strabo and Ptolemy both agree in making it a different place.
GATES OF CILICIA AND SYRIA.
—From Issus Cyrus proceeded one day's march, five parasangs, to the Gates of Cilicia and Syria.
"These were two fortresses;
of the part within them, towards Cilicia, Syennesis and a guard of Cilicians had the charge ;
the part without, towards Syria, a garrison of the king's soldiers was reported to occupy.
Between the two runs a river called Carsus, a plethrum in breadth.
The whole space between the fortresses was three stadia;
and it was impossible to pass it by force;
for the passage was very narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, and above were inaccessible rocks.
At each of the fortresses were gates.
"Dr. Anthon says the common text has Κέρσος, but the reading of the best MSS.
is Καρσος. The Rev. J. T. Macmichael has adopted the correction of Psarus for Pharus, but not that of Kar­ sus for Kersus.
There is every reason to believe that this river, now called Markaz su, corresponds to the Κέρσίας of Ptolemy, and the Crocodilon flumen of Pliny.
It was at the foot of that part of Amanus called Mons Crocodilns.
The French annotators of Pliny have suggested an identity between a Syriac word analogous to Kersus, and the Egyptian Kamses, a crocodile, hence Kersus or Karsus would be the same as the Crocodilon flumen.
The Gates of Cilicia and Syria occur at a point where the Ama­ nus approaches most closely to the sea-shore.
Coming from the north, we have the Markaz su, or Karsus, which flows from a gap in the rocks, between high perpendicular precipices, past the mo­ dern village of Markaz, and then divides into two branches, one of which goes nearly directly to the sea;
the other, after losing itself in a marshy lagune, finds its exit into the sea at a distance of about a mile and a half north of the direct branch.
This first or northerly stream is passed by a bridge, and a little distance farther south are ruins on the shore of the termination of a wall with a gate.
At a distance of about six hundred yards, corresponding to the three stadia of Xenophon, are the more perfect ruins of a wall, which can be traced amid a dense shrubbery, from the mountains down to the sea-shore, where it terminates in a round tower.
A little beyond to the right, and on the slope of the hills, is a Saracenic castle, noticed under the same name of Markaz in the Mecca Itinerary, published by the Geographical Society of Paris.
From this castle the rocks advance directly to the shore, leaving a narrow pass over which a paved road is now carried, and upon which stands the ruined gateway called Jonas' Pillars, or Sakal Tutan, “ Beard-catcher," an Oriental expression for a difficult pass.
Colonel Chesney remarks that “ the Markaz or Merκez su, anci­ ent Karsus, determines the sites of the so-called gates or fortresses, which were erected to defend the ground;
the one being in Cilicia, and the other in Syria, the river flowing between them.
"When we consider the important events of which these gates were the scene, in the time of Cyrus the younger, as also in that of Alexander the Great;
the mystical name of the river, which associates it with ancient crocodile worship, and the Axio-Kersian or Samo-Thracian mysteries, and the ruined edifice correspond­ ing to the Bomitae of Pliny, all domineered over by the castle of Saracenic times, it would be difficult to imagine a more interesting mass of ruins, both in a classical and archœological point of view, grouped together in so small a compass.
Nor is the scene so re­ plete with historical associations wanting in picturesque acces­ sories.
MYRIANDRUS.
—Cyrus is described as proceeding from the Gates of Cilicia and Syria, through Syria, one day's march, five parasangs, to Myriandrus, a city near the sea, inhabited by Phœnicians:
this place was a public mart, and many merchant-vessels lay at anchor there.
The site of Myriandrus has not yet been satisfactorily deter­ mined.
According to the distances given by Xenophon of five parasangs from the Gates of Cilicia and Syria, it would be, if on the sea-shore, either some way beyond Alexandretta on the way to Arsus, or if the sea, as was probably the case, extended further in­ land at that time, and occupied the now pestilent marshes of Alexandretta, beyond Godefroy de Bouillon's Castle;
at the foot of the hills near Jacob or Joseph's well, where Rennell sought for the site in question, or a little beyond that, and nearer to the foot of the pass of Baylan.
It is evident that Myriandrus and the town subsequently named after the Macedonian hero, were not the same, for Strabo mentions both, and in the following succession:
Rhosus (Arsus), Myriandrus, and Alexandria.
The ruins may per­ chance yet be found in the wooded country that lies between Alex­ andretta and Rhosus, at or near the coast, about opposite the entrance of the pass of Baylan.
This is a region which has not yet been satisfactorily explored.
RIVER CHALUS.
—Cyrus proceeded four days'march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Chalus, which was a plethrum in breadth, and full of large tame fish, which the Syrians looked upon as gods, and allowed no one to hurt either them or the pigeons.
This is a long journey, of from 50 to 60 miles, in which several objects of interest are passed over without an observation.
Among the first of these is the pass between Amanus and Rhosus, the true Syrian Gates, in which are situated vestiges of the strong town called Pinara by Pliny and Ptolemy, and by corruption Erana by Cicero, who describes it as being in the mountain above the region in which the altars of Alexander were situated-another proof that the “ Bomitae” were at the foot of Amanus and Rhosus, and not, as Quintus Curtius relates, on the banks of the Pinarus.
Pinara was the Pictanus of the Jerusalem Itinerary, and it is now represented by the town of Baylan, whose mosque was built, according to the Mecca Itinerary, by Sultan Selim, and the Khan by Sultan Sulaiman the Magnificent.
There are also remains of a causeway, of an aqueduct, and of a bridge.
Beyond the Syrian Gates was Pagras or Pangrios, represented apparently by the castle of Ibn Abu Daud;
and at the foot of the mountains, the great plain watered bv three different rivers.
theKarasu, the Aswad, and the Afrin, corresponding to the Labotas, the Aenoporas, and Arceuthus of the Romans, and in the centre of which is the great expanse of the lake of Antioch.
The silence of Xenophon with regard to this mountain-pass, the rivers and lake of the plain of Antioch, and the rocky region beyond, now called St. Simon or Shaikh Barakat, has given origin to various surmises on the part of commentators on the Anabasis.
Rennell has supposed, in consequence of this silence and that of Straho, that the lake did not exist at that time;
and Forster, in his Geographical Dissertation, has made this one of the grounds for supposing that Xenophon kept no journal, or at least no regu­ lar one, of the expedition, but that he drew it up a great many years afterwards.
I think it more likely, from the general charac­ ter of the work, that something occurred, sickness or despondency, and the latter might naturally have been brought about by the clandestine departure of Xenias and Pasion, to distract the atten­ tion of our historian or to make him disinclined to write.
Con­ trast, for example, the indifference of the present moment, with the energy displayed and the minuteness of description indulged in when Xenophon became a leader in the passes of Kurdistan.
A tributary to the river Sajur having been found during the survey of northern Syria by the Euphrates Expedition, to still preserve the name of Baluk or Baluklu su, "Fish River," Colonel Chesney makes Cyrus march in a north-easterly direction, over a very difficult country, to that insignificant rivulet, to turn almost back again in a direction south, a little west, to the Chalib or Ku­ wait—the river of Aleppo, at the point where a large group of tells,.
or mounds of ruin, give evidence of the existence of a once prosperous and flourishing community,I do not, however, see any reason for changing the opinion I had adopted in common with other geographers, that the Chalib or Kuwait represents the Chains of Xenophon.
The direct dis­ tance is perhaps not sufficient, but the difficulties of the road pre­ sented by the pass of Baylan, the marshy plain of Antioch, and the necessity of turning northwards up the valley of the Afrin, to avoid the rocky deserts of Shaikh Barakat, give in detail a distance between the Mediterranean and the river Chalib of at least sixty geographical miles, or of three miles to a parasang.
Notwithstanding a statement of Rauwolf's, that fish were scarce in the market of Aleppo, I stated as the results of my own observ­ ation in the Travels in the Track, &c., that the Chalib abounded in fish, and I have since found in Dr. Russell's Natural History of Aleppo, 1794, vol. ii. p. 207, that not only do fish abound in the Chalib, but that there is a fountain called Haïlan, a Syriac word signifying.“ the powerful," (see my Travels and Researches in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, &c. vol. ii. p. 101,) where, as in the fountain of Birkat a! Ibrahim or Abraham, the beloved, at Urfah, of Mambij ancient Hierapolis, at the tomb of Daniyali Akbar, " the greater Daniel," (see Rawlinson in Journal Roy. Geo. Soc. vol. ix. p. 83,) and elsewhere, fish are still, or were till lately, pre­ served unmolested, and therefore more or less reverenced or sacred in the eyes of the true believers.
Dr. Russell says, "From what I had cursorily remarked in the markets, or at the tables of the inhabitants, and from the appear­ ance of the Kowick (Kuwait), I hardly expected to find so great a variety of fish in that river;
but, upon examination, it was found to produce seventeen species, and amongst those, some hitherto undeseribed.
”
"To the assiduity of the fishermen, which is restrained to no particular season, and exercised with little discretion, may be partly ascribed the small size of the fish in general;
for at Heylan (Hailan), and the fountain of fishes, where they are suffered to re­ main unmolested, they grow considerably larger.
"It is almost needless to remark, that this superstitious reverence for fish is a remnant of the Assyrian and Syro-Arabian worship of fish gods.
Berosus (see Cory's Ancient Fragments, p. 22 and 31) makes Oannes the first and Odakon the last of these.
Selden (De Diis Syris, p. 2G5) is persuaded that this Odakon is the Philistine god Dagon.
The further resemblance between Dagon and Ater­ gatis or Derketo is so great in other respects, that the same au­ thority accounts for the only important difference between them— that of sex—by referring to the androgynous nature of many hea­ then gods.
The Greeks embodied their worship, as usual, into their mythology, by a poetic story of the loves of the goddess Derketa or Derceta.
RIVER DARADAX, or DARDES.
—From the villages of Parysatis on the Chalus, Cyrus advanced, five days' march, a distance of thirty parasangs, to the sources of the river Dardes, which is a plethrum in breadth.
Here was the palace of Bclesys, the governor of Syria, and a very large and beautiful garden, containing all that the seasons produce.
The common text has Δαραδακος, but Anthon * gives Δάρδητος with Dindorf, on good MS. authority.
Colonel Chesney's view of this portion of the progress is, " In advancing first in an easterly di­ rection along the Baluk-su, then southward by the banks of the same stream, and again eastward, quitting the latter when opposite to the fountain of Bab, near the source of the stream called Dhahab or Dabb, it is about sixty-one miles to the last, the presumed Dara­ dax:
and if the windings of the Koweik (Kuwait) be followed in the earlier part of the march, it would be seventy or eighty miles from the higher part of the Chalib or Chains, which, as in the time of Xenophon, still abounds in fish.
The distance (thirty para­ sangs) given by Xenophon between the rivers Chains and Dara­ dax, which was accomplished in five marches, agrees with the nature of the intervening country;
for whether the windings of the upper part of the Koweik were followed, or the stream forded two or three times in preference, a fifth march would be requisite, as already mentioned." (ii. p. 213.)
Some difficulties present themselves in accepting this determina­ tion.
In the first place, the distance given would accord better with the idea of Cyrus having crossed the Syrian plains from the Chalus to the Euphrates, notwithstanding Xenophon's silence upon the subject.
The same silence, or rather passing over all notice of the river Euphrates until the army came to Thapsaeus­ is observed throughout, and may have been an inadvertence, for the nature of the country would oblige an army to keep along the banks of the river;
and Colonel Chesney, who identifies the foun­ tain of Dhahab with that of Dardes, still makes Cyrus, notwith­ standing the silence of Xenophon upon the subject, join the Eu­ phrates at Balls.
The name of the site—Balis—corresponding to the Barbalissus or Barbarissus of the Romans, and the ruins existing there, would point to that place as the site of the palace of the Persian satrap.
Then again, at that point there is a great alluvial plain, which to the present day abounds in boars and other game, while all beyond, or westward, is a dry arid upland, a perfect wilderness, which, how­ ever, may be modified somewhat by the waters of the Dhabab.
Lastly, there was a canal, taken from the Euphrates at Balis, which might be a hundred feet wide at its origin, as described by Xenophon, and which it is difficult to imagine the fountain of Fay, as Rennell calls it—al Bab, or Taidiff—could present at its origin.
There is to be added to all this, that the back distance from Thapsacus (Al Hammam) to Balis corresponds precisely with the distance given by Xenophon between the palace of Belesis and Thapsacus, that is, fifteen parasangs or forty-five miles by the bends of the river.
Notwithstanding the points in favour of one and the other view of the subject, common sense would point to a probable visit to the fountain of Dhahab, or Dardes, on the way to the pa­ lace of Belesis at Balis.
But so common sense would also point to the identity of Bayas, or Baiae, with Issus, where is a river to represent the Pinarus, a plain large enough to fight a battle, with­ out being cut up by deep ruts like the plain of Dali-ehai, and where the ships could be moored opposite Cyrus' tent, a proceed­ ing scarcely possible at the mouths of the Dali-chai, only that other circumstances do not uphold this hypothesis.
THAPSACUS.
—Having wantonly destroyed the palace and park of Belesis, Cyrus is described by Xenophon as proceeding, in three days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which is there four stadia in breadth, and on which was situ­ ated a large and rich city, named Thapsacus.
Colonel Chesney (ii. 213) describes these as “ pressing marches, following and constantly touching the Euphrates from Balis," which accords with the view previously taken of this portion of the march.
The distance here given of forty-five miles, corresponds with the overland distance from Balis to the ford celebrated among the Arabs, as that of the Anazah or Badawin.
This ford, as such or as a bridge, was used for the passage alike of Persian, Greek, and Roman armies, and more lately of Arabs, Tartars, and Turks.
Xerxes, who, according to Herodotus, crossed the Hellespont by a bridge of boats, in which one was tied to the other, had con­ structed a similar one at Thapsacus, but this was destroyed by Abrocomas on the approach of Cyrus.
Alexander dragged over the boats necessary for the passage of the river from the Medi­ terranean.
The remains of a paved causeway are still to be observed on both banks of the river, which is here eight hundred yards, or four stadia, in width.
This causeway is marked in the Augustan and Theodosian Tables as part of a road carried by Palmyra to Ba. bylonia, as also northwards to Carrhae, Edessa, and to more re­ mote countries.
A congregation of mounds, well worthy of archœological explor­ ation, are all that remain of the ancient Tiphsah, which was taken possession of by Solomon, probably in connexion with the series of operations (of which the building or fortification of Tadmor was one) adopted by him for the purpose of drawing the Eastern trade into his own dominions.
Tiphsah became afterwards
Thap­ sacus, both signifying the same thing, “the ford."
The same place is called Sura by Pliny and by Ptolemy, and this was its name in medieval times, for it is called in the Ecclesiastical notices of the Lower Empire, Flavia firma Sum.
It was also, according to Stephanus, called Turmeda by the Syrians, and Amphipolis under the successors of Alexander.
The ruins are now called Su­ riyah.
Rennet and D’Anville were induced from the supposed exist­ ence of a ford or pass of the Euphrates at Dair, “ the monastery," and in ignorance of the existence of this ford, to identify Thapsa­ cus with that little Arabic town, which is built upon a vast mound of ruin-the remains of some site of antiquity.
But it is two hun­ dred and eleven miles by the river from Balis to Dair, and to get over this difficulty, these two distinguished geographers were obliged to suppose that Xenophon had, by an oversight, misplaced the distances of Belesis to Thapsacus, (fifteen parasangs,) and from Thapsacus to the Araxes—Xenophon’s name for the Khabur- (fifteen parasangs,) and that it should have been fifty parasangs from Balis to Thapsacus, and fifteen from Thapsacus to the Araxes.
It is satisfactory to find by the true determination of the position of Thapsacus at fifteen parasangs from Balis, that there is no necessity whatsoever for this violation of the accuracy of the historian.
RIVER ARAXES.
—Cyrus having with his army forded the Eu­ phrates at Thapsacus, the waters rising no higher than the breast;
he is described by Xenophon as advancing through Syria, nine days’ march, a distance of fifty parasangs.
to the river Araxes, where were a number of villages, stored with corn and wine.
Having crossed the Euphrates, it is manifest that the country the army was marching in was in reality Mesopotamia, but it was by no means an uncommon thing for the Romans to describe the districts in question sometimes as in Syria, at others in Mesopota­ mia.
Pliny and Strabo both speak of the country lying between Thapsaeus and the Seenite or nomade Arabs, as Syria.
Wherefore Xenophon called the river Khabur, Araxes, it is diffi­ cult to determine.
The name was by no means an uncommon one, and Strabo, in accordance with the national custom of referring foreign names to a Greek origin, connects the word with ἀράσσω, and adds that the Peneus was once called Araxes, on account of its having separated Ossa from Olympus at the gorge of Tempe.
*This river was, however, known to antiquity generally by other names, approaching more or less to its present appellation.
Thus, it is described in the Old Testament (2 Kings xxiv. 15;
Ezek. i. l, 3;
iii. 15, 23;
x. 15, 20) under the name of Chebar, as a river of Mesopotamia, upon the banks of which Nebuchadnezzar plant­ ed a colony of Jews, among whom was the prophet Ezekiel.
Layard says that in the Hebrew text the name is spelt in two dif­ ferent ways.
In Kings we have Khabour.
In Ezekiel it is written Kebar.
So also in the Septuagint it is written Χοβάρ.
It is called Aboras and Abboras by Strabo, Zosimus, Ammianus, Procopius, and others.
Ptolemy writes it Khaboras.
Layard, whilst carrying on his archæological explorations in Assyria, having been informed by the Arabs that two colossal idols, similar to those at Nimrud, had been laid bare by the waters of the Khabur;
he repaired to the spot, and was rewarded by the discovery of a considerable number of monuments of Assyrian times, of which he says, "the Archaic character of the treatment and design, the peculiar form of the features, the rude though for­ cible delineation of the muscles, and the simplicity of the details, certainly convey the impression of greater antiquity than any monuments hitherto discovered in Assyria Proper.
"The Khabur is a large river having its sources in the Karajah Tagh in northern Mesopotamia, and receiving in its course down wards tributaries from Kuhrasar (Sinna) and Has al Ain (Resaina) from the west;
from Masku, Mardin, Dara, Nisibin, (ancient Myg­ donius,) Asnawur, and Cliil Agha from the east, besides a rivulet called Al Hauli or Holi from the marshes of Khatuniyah in the Sinjar.
The main branch of the river is by accident omitted in the map accompanying Layard's account of his discoveries in Nineveh and Babylon. (1853.)At the junction of the Khabur and he Euphrates, we have on the north the ruins of Carchemish of Scripture, called by the Greeks Kirkesion, and by the Romans, with whom it was long a frontier town, Cerensinm.
The place is called by the Arabs in the presen:
day Kirkisiyah, and also from the abundance of ruins, Abu Sarai, “ the father of palaces."
Layard, who did not visit it, says " Abou Psera.”
Al Wakidi, in his History of the Conquest of Mesopotamia by the Arabs, ealls it Karkisha.
To the south are the mounds of Kalneh, supposed by Colonel Chesney (i. 52;
117, 118) to be the site of Calneh, or Chalneh, the fourth of Nimrod’s cities.
(Gen. x. 10.)According to the Chaldee version, with which Eusebius and Jerome agree, this is the same place that was subsequently called Ctesiphon.
Colonel Rawlinson has however, by the aid of those important paleographic researches which promise to throw an entirely new light on Assyro-Babylonian and Chaldean history and geography, discovered the ideograph for Calneh among the inscribed bricks of a place called Niffer.
(Ann. Report of the Royal Asiatic Society vol. xv. p. xix.)
He had previously (Jour, of Roy. Asiat.
Soc. vo.. x. p. 22) identified, as he also said from the evidence of the bricks, the same primeval site with the Chaldean ruins of Kalwadha near Baghdad.
ARABIA.
—Cyrus advanced from the Khabur through Arabia, naving the Euphrates on his right, five days' march through the desert, a distance of five parasangs.
Rawlinson remarks that in the cuneiform inscriptions the name of Arabia (Arabaya) is sometimes introduced between those of Babylon and Assyria, sometimes between Assyria and Egypt;
and lie adds, “ I think, therefore, we may suppose the title to apply to the Mesopotamian Desert, and the basin of the Euphrates, which have always been inhabited by Arab tribes, rather than to the vast Southern Peninsula.
The Jews, in the same way, whose geogra­ phical notions were very limited, designated as Arabia, or the country of the Arabs, the region immediately joining Palestine, and stretching southwards to the Red Sea."
(Journ. of Roy. Asiatic Society, vol. xi. p. 38.)Thus it was that, in accordance with the views entertained at that epoch, we find Xenophon describing those regions of Mesopotamia which lie north-westward of the Khabur, as Syria;
and those to the south, as Arabia.
The Athenian historian's description of the desert is so concise, and so graphic, as to be familiar to every one, and, as a consequent penalty, has been often quoted as descrip­ live of regions which have little in common with the particular territory in question.
RIVER MASCAS AND CITY OF CORSOTE.
—Marching through this region, Xenophon relates, they came to the river Mascas, the breadth of which is a plethrum.
Here was a large deserted city, of which the name was Corsote, and which was entirely surround­ ed by the Mascas.
At a distance of sixty-three miles touching the river curves, or of one hundred miles and upwards by the river's winding, a con­ siderable tract of alluvium is cut off from the main-land, by a canal, which drawn from the river at a northerly point, empties itself by three different embouchures to the south.
Beyond are cliffs of marls and gypsum, upon which traces of ruins of older time are still to be met.
The place is called in the present day Irzah or Izrah, and also by corruption Werdi.
It is not at all improbable from this site being nearly opposite to Al Kayim, the Agamana of Ptolemy, where the great desert route from Palestine to Babylon first touches the Euphrates, that this was one of the cities of bondage, where the captive Israelites awaited the coming of Ezra, with the glad message that was to enable them to return to their own country.
In this case the Masca would correspond to the Ahava of Scripture.
The ruins of Corsote of Xenophon would appear to have been on the plain, being described as entirely surrounded by the Mas­ cas, unless we are to understand, as is more probable, that this description allides to the great bend of the river at this point, and which is described by Balbi, who descended the Euphrates in 1579, as keeping them from morning to noon in sight of the ruins.
When Balbi, however, speaks of these ruins as of greater extent than the city of Cairo, and presenting nothing to view but portions of massy walls and lofty towers, we must conclude that he mis­ took the cliffs and great broken masses of gypsum for fragments of ruin.
Rauwolf, who travelled in 1574, also described the penin­ sula as occupying more than half a day to encompass it.
GATES OF BABYLONIA.
—From Corsote Cyrus proceeded, thir­ teen days' march, through the desert, a distance of ninety para­ bangs, still keeping the Euphrates on the right, and arrived at a place called the Gates.
Colonel Chesney is inclined to think, that as it appears by the subsequent movements, that the “Gates” were about twenty-four miles short of the Median Wall, the past, in question may safely be placed about twenty-seven miles below Hit, or nearly opposite to the village of Jarrah, from which, by the map, there are about one hundred and seventy-five or one hundred and seventy-seven geographical miles to represent the ninety parasangs from Corsote to the Pylae, which at 1.98 each, give 178.2 geographical miles.
(ii. 214.)
The banks of the Euphrates in this part of the route, and more particularly in the lower portion, are exceedingly rocky and irre­ gular, till we arrive at the level alluvial plains of Babylonia.
It is difficult among these irregular hills to distinguish one place as more worthy of being designated as a pass than the other, and I had hence been induced by that circumstance, and by a consider­ ation of the distance travelled, (and which, by supposing the troops to have been compelled to keep to the banks of the river, I had given a much greater length to than Colonel Chesney,) to identify the Pylae with the pass or descent from the hills upon the plain of Babylonia itself.
Rennell, it is to be observed, coincides in this view of the subject, as he conjectures that the term pylae refers to the shutting up of the river itself between the mountains, which terminate at the same place on both sides of the river.
This termination of the hilly country at the level alluvial plain of Babylonia constitutes indeed a very remarkable feature in the physical aspect of these regions.
The Rev. J. F. Maemichael,in his edition of Xenophon, (Appen­ dix, p. 336,) suggests the conclusion that Pylae was neither city (as Larcher surmised) nor mountain defile, but the ancient pass into Babylonia through the Median Wall, at a time when it ex­ tended—as when entire it must have done—to the Euphrates.
There is a great deal of plausibility in this suggestion.
CHARMANDE.—
On this long march through the desert, the troops are described as passing over on rafts of skins to an opulent and extensive city, called Cliarmande.
As no distances are given, I was inclined to identify this site with the most important posi­ tion on the right bank of the Euphrates, that occurs within the inter­ val between Corsote and the “ Gates," viz. the city of Iz or Izaneso­ polis, whose bitumen fountains were visited by Alexander, by Trajan, by Severus, and by Julian;
but Colonel Chesney (ii. 214) is more inclined to seek for the site at some ruins, which occur on the right bank opposite to the island of Jibbah or Jubbah.
This is evidently, at the present moment, a position that is not satisfac­ torily determined.
FIELD OF REVIEW IN BABYLONIA.
—Cyrus is described as pro­ ceeding through Babylonia, three days' march, a distance of twelve parasangs;
and at the end of the third day's march, he reviewed his army, both Greeks and Barbarians, in the plain, about mid­ night;
for he expected that with the ensuing dawn the king would come up with his army to offer him battle.
The spot at which this review took place would, allowing 3 geo.
miles to the parasang, be 36 miles beyond the Pylae, 32 miles south of the Wall of Media, 36 miles north of Cunaxa, and 72 miles north of Babylon.
If we allow only 2.5 geo. miles, or place the Pylæ north of the plain of Babylonia, the distances will be proportionately diminished.
We have, however, a means of deter­ mining the positioning of the army of Cyrus on the plain of Baby­ lonia a little more accurately, from the events recorded in the next day's march.
TRENCH OF ARTAXERXES.
—Cyrus proceeded from the field of re­ view on the plain of Babylonia, one day's march, a distance of three parasangs, with all his forces, as well Greek as Barbarian, drawn up in order of battle;
for he expected that on this day the king would give him battle;
as about the middle of the day's march, there was a deep trench dug;
the breadth of it was five fathoms, and the width three.
This ditch extended up through the plain, to the distance of twelve parasangs, as far as the Wall of Media.
Here are the canals which are supplied from the river Tigris;
there are four of them, each a plethrum in breadth, and very deep;
boats employed in conveying corn sail along them.
They discharge themselves into the Euphrates, are distant from each other one parasang, and there are bridges over them.
Near the Euphrates was a narrow passage between the river and the trench, about twenty feet in breadth.
This trench the Great King had made to serve as a defence, when he heard that Cyrus was marching against him.
By this passage Cyrus and his army made their way, and got within the trench.
If the trench or ditch, here spoken of, had been a canal drawn diagonally from the river Tigris, such a canal 36 geo.
miles in length, starting from the N. E. or Tigris end of the Median Wall, would just touch on the maps attached to the Expedition for the Survey of the Euphrates and Tigris, the Nahr Isa or Saklawiya canal at or about the ruins of Sifairah, ancient Sippara.
But there seems no reason to suppose that it was a canal.
Xenophon appears to distinguish this trench or ditch from the four canals derived from the river Tigris which he describes in the same para­ graph.
This, however, may be open to doubt.
In such a situation a trench or ditch mignt naturally be supposed to be full of water.
But whichever may be the case, it is not said that it was drawn from the Tigris, but merely that it extended upwards to the Me­ dian Wall.
Now a distance of 36 geo.
miles laid down on the Expedition map from a central portion of the Median Wall, would carry the trench to the Abu Gharib country, somewhere about where the Nahr Malka or Malik has its origin.
This would place the field of review in the same region, some seven or eight miles to the northward, and would lead us to suppose, as would be most naturally the case, that the four canals were drawn from the great overflow of the Tigris near Accad, called Al Hur, and from the Tigris itself between that and Al Ghirarah, in the very line in fact of Colonel Chesney's proposed line of communication.
All the com­ mentators on Xenophon have found great difficulty in admitting the historian's accuracy in this point, because he differs from other authorities, as Herodotus, Diodorus, Arrian, Pliny, and Ammianus, in making the canals flow from the Tigris;
all others describing them as flowing from the Euphrates.
But this difficulty loses its force, when we consider that the alluvial plain between the two rivers is so level that it merely requires to alter the diagonal direc­ tion of a canal to determine which way its waters shall flow, and thus the marsh of Al Hur is flooded at one season by the Tigris, at another by the Euphrates through the Isa canal.
Thus also the Isa, Nahr Malik and other canals flow from the Euphrates to the Tigris, while the Shat al Hai flows from tke Tigris to the Euphrates.
It is probable that, at the time of Artaxerxes, the usual canals may have also flowed from Euphrates to Tigris, and that the four canals of Xenophon described as only 2½ or 3 miles from one another, were exceptions to the Nile, and drawn from the marsh of Accad and the Tigris, above the canals of Babylon itself, which may have flowed from the Euphrates to the Tigris.
BATTLE-FIELD OF CUNAXA.
—As the king made no attempt at the trench to prevent the passage of Cyrus's army, it was thought both by Cyrus and the rest that he had given up the intention of fighting;
so that on the day following Cyrus proceeded on his march with less caution.
This was still more the case on the next day's march ;
when news came that the Great King was approach­ ing, and the battle so fatal to Cyrus took place.
We have here an account of short desultory and irregular marches, which would have brought the allies, according to Colo­ nel Chesney, to at or near the mounds of Muhammad, 34 or 36 miles along the river from the Median Wall;
but, according to my former estimate of the value of the parasang, nearer to the site of Imsayab or Mussayib about 15 miles direct, but upwards of 20 by the bends of the river north of Babylon.
It is evident that Cyrus deemed himself very near to Babylon, since he had almost given up any thoughts of resistance on the part of Artax­ erxes.
Xenophon describes the battle fully, but does not mention the name of the place where it was fought.
Plutarch, in his Life of Arta­ xerxes, has alone preserved it, and states that it was 500 stadia from Babylon.
This would make it fifty miles north of Babylon.
Xenophon, however, says that the distance from the field of battle to Babylon was only 360 stadia, or 36 miles, a distance which would tally best with that of the before-mentioned mounds of Muhammad.
MOUND, ON PLAIN OF BABYLONIA.
—The night of the battle, the Greeks pursued the Persians as far as a certain village, where they hailed;
for above the village was a hill, upon which the king's troops had checked their flight.
The hill here alluded to appears to have been one of the numerous artificial mounds, topes, or tells, sometimes sepulchrai sometimes heaps of ruin, which abound on the plain of Babylonia.
The word used to designate the hill is sufficiently descriptive, γηλοφος, a compound of γη, earth, and λοφοι, hill, mound, or tumulus, “ a heap of earth.
"It is the more important to establish this fact, as there are no natural hills on the plain of Babylonia;
and therefore the mention made by Xenophon of a hill at this place, has led the distinguished traveller, Baillie Fraser, to consider it as furnishing evidence of the battle having been fought to the north of the Median Wall.
BABYLONIAN VILLAGES.
—As soon as a retreat had been decided upon between the Greeks and the Barbarians, and the line of route to be followed determined by Ariaeus, they started on a long day's journey to certain villages, the position of which would be in a great measure determined by a more satisfactory conclusion as to the site of Cunaxa.
Colonel Chesney places these villages on the Abu Gharib or Nahr Sarsar of Abulfeda, near the extensive mounds and ruins of Kusli or Sindiyah.
The direction of the next march is not given, but it is stated that the army met with ditches and canals, so full of water, that they could not cross without bridges;
but they made crossings of the palm-trees which had fallen, and others which they cut down.
There is every reason to believe from this statement that the Greeks were led into the interior of Babylonia, and Clearchus ap­ pears justly to have suspected that the ditches had been filled with water purposely, as it was not the season for irrigating the land.
At last they arrived at some villages, where was plenty of corn, hnd wine made from dates, and where it would appear they re­ mained twenty-three or twenty-four days.
WAI.L OF MEDIA.
—At length, after marching three days, they arrived at the Wall of Media, as it is called, and passed to the other side of it.
This wall was built of burnt bricks, laid in bitu­ men ;
it was twenty feet in thickness, and a hundred in height, and the length of it was said to be twenty parasangs;
and it was not far distant from Babylon.“
Not the least remarkable of the discoveries," says the Rev. J. F. Macmichael in the Appendix to his Xenophon," which of late years have marked the progress of geographical inquiry in this most interesting—but, till of late, unexplored—region, is the actual existence at the present time of an ancient wall stretching across Mesopotamia at the head of the Babylonian plain.
Mr. Ross, who first examined it at its eastern terminus, in 1836, describes it under the name of Khalu or Sidd Nimrud, (wall or embankment of Nimrod.) and as a straight wall 25 long paces thick, and from 35 to 40 feet high, running S. W. J N. as far as the eye could reach, to two mounds called Ramelah, (Sifairah, Ainsw. p. 81-2,) on the Euphrates, some hours above Felujah.
—The eastern extremity was built of the small pebbles of the country, cemented with lime of great tenacity;
and farther inland, his Bedwin guides told him it was built of brick, and in some places worn down level with the desert,—and was built by Nimrod to keep off the people of Nineveh, with whom he had an implacable feud.
(Journal of It. Geog. S. ix. p. 446.)
It was further examined by Captain Lynch, and its eastern extremity determined to be in lat. 34° 3'30", and long. 21' 50" W. of Baghdad. (Ibid. p. 472.)"
The identity of this wall with Xenophon's Wall of Media was assumed by the explorers tacitly, but with strong ground of pro­ bability.
Of the great antiquity of the Sidd Nimrud there can be no question;
record of its origin there is none, except local tra­ dition assigning it to Nimrod.
On the other hand, the continued existence of a wall (corresponding to the Median) from Xeno­ phon’s age down to comparatively recent times, is attested by a chain of scattered notices in later writers.
Such a wall is men­ tioned by Eratosthenes, (in the third century B. C., quoted by Strabo ii. l, and xi. 14,) as τὀ τὴς Σεμιράμιδος διατειχισμα, having its eastern terminus at or near Opis.
Again, its western terminus was noticed (in a state of ruin) by Amm.
Marcellinus (363 A. D.) at Macepracta on the Euphrates, near the head of a canal, which he distinguishes from the Naha Malcha, (Nahr Malik,) doubtless the Saklawiyeh, a few miles north of which is the S. W. extremity of the Sidd Nimrud."..
Their identity is further attested by their occupying the same general position as a partition-line between the rocky desert of Arabia and the fertile alluvial plain of Babylonia :
the Sidd Nim­ rud, for all practical purposes, distinguishes the Babylonian plain from the hilly and rocky country.
(Ainsw. p. 82, note 2.)
—And that a like position must be assigned to the Median Wall is strong­ ly indicated by the name it bears, TO Μηδιας τεἵχος.
For the Medes under Cyaxares had conquered all Assyria up to Babylonia, a tract which, in Herodotus, includes the entire canal distinct, (i. 193,) and in Xenophon commences where the desert of Arabia terminates—at or near a place called Pylae, (i. 5. 5,) where, accord­ ingly, we should look for the western terminus of the Median Wall.
”
From a consideration of the different circumstances detailed by Xenophon of the first retrograde steps taken after the battle of Cunaxa, I was induced to believe that Tissaphernes, having arrived with his army and the guides, marched, as Xenophon expresses it, as if he designed to return home;
that he led the Greeks three days' march, or about thirty-six miles, towards Sifairah, at which point he turned round, and conducted them through the Wall into Sitacene, thus leaving them in perplexity with regard to the rela­ tions of that rich and fertile province to the city of Babylon.
(Trav. in the Track, &c., p. 108-9.)
The following is the account given by Colonel Chesney of this the first portion of the Katabasis, and which is so difficult to un­ derstand.
“In taking a northerly direction from the presumed position of the camp, it would be necessary to cross the Nalir Malka;
and on account of this obstruction, as well as the pre­ sence of an enemy, the distance made would scarcely exceed ten miles.
Fatigued by the march, and without sustenance, a slight circumstance was sufficient to cause a tumult, and almost a panic, among the Greeks.
The panic was, however, speedily calmed by the ingenuity of Clearchus, and at day-break he marched with the intention of becoming the assailant.
This bold manœuvre led to a negotiation with the king on equal terms, and guides were in consequence appointed to conduct the Greeks across the Nahr Sersar, and its affluents, which intersect this part of the country.
These cuts appear to have been filled with water, but the difficulties were overcome by cutting down the palm-trees to make bridges, in which operation Clearchus set the example;
and the army reached the intended halting-place in some villages probably not more than ten miles from the preceding station.
These were abundantly provided with corn, vinegar, and wine made from dates After spending about twenty-three days in negotiations, having made engagements to be faithfully conducted homeward, and ob­ tained supplies, the Greeks, the troops of Ariacus, and those of the king under Tissaphernes, commenced what seemed a peace­ able march, although certain circumstances attending it gave rise to suspicion, and some precautions were adopted in conse­ quence by the Greeks.
In three days, probably, taking, as in the preceding march, a westerly direction, in order to round the marshes and inundations near Akar Kuf, the armies came up to and de parted from the Median Wall into the interior.
This wall, whose remains are described in Xenophon, was of bricks, and once 100 feet high and 20 feet thick :
it is still to be traced, with its towers and ditch, running south-westward from the Tigris, nearly opposite Kadisiyeh, to the Euphrates, near Felujah, a distance of forty­ two or forty-three miles.
"This view of the subject is illustrated by the following note.
"The translation of this passage of Xenophon, ἀφικοντο πρὸς τὀ Μηδιας τεῑχος, καὶ παρη̃λθον αυτου εισω, (Anabasis, lib. ii. cap. iv.,) has been much discussed and variously rendered.
In Allpress's Xeno­ phon. p. 80, the army is made to arrive at, and pass along within, the Median Wall;
which translation is also given in the Anabasis of Xenophon, by Charles Anthon, L.L. D. William Tegg and Co. Cheapside (By passing within this wall, Dr. Anthon does not appear to understand keeping to the south side of it, but passing through it, for he says in a note, (p. 157 of the 1st edition,) Ains­ worth thinks that this going throughtheMedian Wall, &c. W. F.A.);
by the Rev. Dr. Butcher, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin;
as well as by Schneider, who, in a note on this passage, condemns Halbkardt for translating it, 'Kamen sie zur Medischen Mauer, nnd setzen nŭn jenseit derselben ihren Marsch fort.
'
"Viger, in his Greek Idioms, also quotes an instance from Xeno­ phon, where the verb occurring in the passage in question joined with a substantive in the genitive case, signifies “departure from" or deflection;
and Donnegan’s Greek Lexicon gives εἴσω as an ad­ verb, with the signification of “ in the interior," “ inside," or with­ in, which renderings of the passage are in conformity with the relative geographical positions of the Median Wall and Sitace, On the other hand, Hutchinson, in his edition of Xenophon, p. 139, (Hutchinson’s translation is “ intrάque eum ingressi sunt,” p. 145, Oxford edition, 1745. W.F.A.,) and Mitford, History of Greece, vol. iv. p. IS!:
!, state that the Greeks came up to and passed through the Median Wall;
and this interpretation has been followed by Bishop Thirlwall, in his History of Greece, vol. iv. p. 335, cd. Lon don, 18-17, since he conceives, in accordance with Passow, in his Greek Lexicon, that when joined with a verb of motion, εἴσω must bear the signification of to the inside, not on the inside.
The bishop of St. David's considers that Schneider's condemnation of Halb­ kardt arises solely from the great difficulty of reconciling his trans lation with the geographical position of Sitace, but that the philo.
logical difficulty thus raised by Schneider, is quite as great as the geographical difficulty of the ether.
The same opinion appears to be held by other Grecian scholars;
the Right Rev. Dr. Wilson, Lord Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, and the Rev. Dr. Mac-Donnell, Senior Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, among the number.” (Vol. ii. p. 219 et seq.)To this array of authorities I may add that of the Rev. J. F. Macmichael, Head-master of the Grammar School, Burton on Trent, who says, “ We gather from the narrative, that they commenced the retreat (after joining Ariaeus) in a northerly direction, (ii. 2. 8,) and continued it with Tissaphernes—who was journeying home­ wards (ώς εις οικον ἀπιών, iv. 8)—far enough in this direction to pass out of Babylonia ;
for on the sixth day of the retreat, they passed within the Median Wall (παρη̃λθον εἵσω αὐτοῡ, iv. 12)—an expression which can only signify an entry through it into Baby­ lonia.
(Cf. 1. iv. 4, 5—vii. 16.)
The line of route suggested by Mr. Ainsworth, viz.
back by Pylae, and then for some distance on the, N. side of the Wall, is apparently the only one consistent with the data, geographical and historical, of the problem,” P. 339.
Apart, however, from the respect due to Colonel Cliesney's views of the matter—it remains quite an open question, whether a north- westerly route, to avoid the Hur or marshes of Akka Knf, would not have taken the Greeks to a position so near to the Median Wall as to be described by them as within that wall, before they turned to the eastward towards Sitaee,SITACE.
—From the Wall of Media they proceeded, in two days' march, the distance of eight parasangs;
crossing two canals, the one by a permanent bridge, the other by a temporary one, formed of seven boats.
These canals were supplied from the river Tigris ;
and from one to the other of them were cut ditches across the country, the first of considerable size, and the next smaller;
and at last diminutive drains, such as are cut in Greece through the panic fields.
They then arrived at the Tigris ;
near which there was a large and populous city, called Sitace, distant from the banks of the river only fifteen stadia.
Xenophon, by repeating the circumstance here, that the canals ere derived from the Tigris, lends additional weight to his prior statement, that at that time the northerly part of the plain of Babylonia was watered from the Tigris.
The Arabs of Balad in.
formed Captain Lynch, that there were anciently two canals, which ran across from the Tigris to the Euphrates—one from Istabalat, called Jalilu-i-Darb, near where the Dnjail, "Little Tigris," leaves the Tigris, and one that ran from the Dujail itself, called Bu Khai­ mah.
(Journal of It. G. S., vol. ix. p. 474.)There are also in the same district the remains of several canals which were drawn in olden time from the river Tigris to flow back into the same river.
Among the most remarkable are the Dujail, or Dijail,or Little Tigris;
the Shat Aidha and the Ishakli.
Akbara, a favourite residence of the Khalifs, was on the Shat Aidha.
Mr. Ross sought for Sitace at Shiriat at Baidha, or the White River, where there are extensive ruins, consisting of mounds and embankments, and the dry ditch of a canal extending northwards some miles, and westwards almost to the colossal ruin of Akka Knf or Accad—the only remaining examine of an Assyrian or Baby- Ionian ruin not converted by the lapse of time and disintegration of materials into a tel or mound.
Having been led to reject the identification of the river Physcus with the modern Athaim, as surmised by Mr. Ross and Captain Lynch, upon the grounds advanced by Colonel Rawlinson, that if the Katur or Nahrawan canals existed in the time of Xenophon, they would represent the Physcus and not the Athaim, I was further induced, by considering the incompatibility of the distance between Shiriat al Baidha and Opis at the confluence of the Athaim, with that reported by Xenophon, to seek for the ruins of Sitace at or near the site of Akbara.
Colonel Chesney has, by placing Opis at or a little above Kayim or Kaim, and close to the head of a second or lower branch of the Nahr-wan, called the Nahr al Risas, and which he identifies with the Physcus, got over this difficulty.
"In taking the distance backward," says Colonel Chesney, vol. ii. p. 221, “ at the average rate of the march through Asia Minor, or 2.608 geographical miles per parasang along the Upper Tigris, (at the favourable season of the year,) from the Known point of the river Zab, there would be 130 geographical miles for the fifty parasangs to Opis, which places that city a little above Kaim, and close to the head of the Nahrawan, instead of being, as before sup­ posed, some miles lower down near the river Athaim.
Twenty parasangs, or fifty-two geographical miles, from the latter, the anci­ ent bed of the Tigris, would place Sitace about ten miles north- west of Baghdad, near Sheriat el Beidha, the presumed site of the Sitace of Xenophon.
"This identification, it will be observed, establishes the correspond­ ence of the old bed of the river Tigris—the Shat Aidha—with the Tigris of Xenophon.
OPIS.
—From the Tigris, the Greeks are described as proceeding in four days' march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Physcus, which was a plethrum in breadth, and over which was a bridge.
Here was situate a large town, called Opis.
The discussion of the true positioning of Sitace involved, it has ocen seen, a knowledge of the site of Opis, which was situated at the issue of the Katur, or Nahrawan, from the Tigris.*
The Rev. Mr. Macmichael remarks upon this identification of a river with a canal, that it is not improbably the third instance in the work of Xenophon.
“ Ainsworth," he says in the Appendix, (p. 339,) "fol­ lowing Colonel Rawlinson, who is inclined to identify the Physcus with the ancient canal, Katur or Nahrawan, (compare the case of the Daradax and Masca, called ποταμοί, 1. iv. 10, n., and v. 4;
the breadth also, (a plethrum,) which is uniformly that of canals, (v. 1;
vii. 15,) somewhat favour the supposition.
"
Opis was a city of considerable commercial importance at one time, having, according to the learned Dr. Vincent, risen into emi.
nence upon the decline of the Assyrian cities on the Tigris, and then again decayed in its turn, as Seleucia, and Apamea, the erea- Lion of the Seleucidae, became conspicuous ;
hence its positioning is of great interest to comparative geography generally.
VILLAGES OF PARYSATIS.—From Opis the Greeks proceeded through Media, six days' march through a desert country, a dis­ tanqe of thirty parasangs, when they arrived at the villages of Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus and the king.
At 2.608 geographical miles for each of the thirty parasangs, or 78.24 geographical miles, the villages in question would have been situated, according to Colonel Chesney, (ii. 222,) about three miles beyond the Lesser Zab — a river concerning the existence of which Xenophon is as silent as he was regarding the Lake of Antioch and its tributaries.
The position of these villages, according to the distance stated in the text, would, says Dr. Anthon, (note to Xenophon, p. 163,) both in Lynch's and in Rich's maps, fall pretty nearly at the position marked Tel Kunus in the first, and Tel Geloos in the second.
This is the same identification as in the “ Travels in the Track."
It is however over-estimated, being laid down in the maps, in­ stead of as in other cases corrected for the difficulties of road, which in most cases render my estimate of 3 geo.
miles equal to not more than 2.5 on the map, making them really of the same value as accorded by Rennell, Colonel Chesney, Hamilton, and Layard.
CAENAE.
—From the villages of Parysatis the Greeks advanced in a march of five days more through the desert, a distance of twenty parasangs, having the Tigris on their left.
At the end of the first day's march, there was situate on the opposite bank of the river, a large and opulent city, called Caenae, whence the Barba­ rians brought over, on rafts made of hide, a supply of bread, cheese, and wine.
Captain Lynch having found some ruins with a canal called Senn, not far from the embouchure of the Great Zab on the oppo­ site side of the Tigris, I was induced to identify the Gaenae of the Greeks with that spot, puzzled however at the same time to iden­ tify this site with the Scena of Strabo, and which according to the Amasian geographer was a remarkable city—the capital of the Seenite Arabs — eighteen schaeni or one hundred and eight milt.!
from Seleucia, and with a canal which was carried thence to the confines of Babylonia.
Notwithstanding the difficulty of getting a canal through tho hilly ranges south of Kalah Shirgat, still, considering the correc­ lion given to the distances by Colonel Chesney, I am inclined to suppose that the site must be the same as the ruins at the last­ mentioned place, and not exactly, as Colonel Chesney has it, at the ruins of the Ur of the Persians, which he says arc three or four miles below Shirkat—or Toprak Kalahsi. (ii. p. 222.)Kalah Shirgat, since the time when I first visited it in company with Layard, in 1840, has been the scene of many most remark­ able and interesting discoveries in Assyrian Archaeology, made by that most successful explorer.
Among other monuments of olden time, a cylinder, a splendid relic, containing 800 lines of beautiful writing, at least 100 years older than the oldest monument hitherto discovered in Assyria, was found here.
It was, when found, broken into a hundred frag­ ments, and in some parts even reduced to powder;
but the whole bas been carefully joined together, and barely a dozen lines lost.
Colonel Rawlinson states (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, vol. xv. p. xvi. et seq.) that it contains the bulletins of Tiglath Pile­ ser 1., a king who is mentioned in the annals of Assur-akh-pal, as a remote ancestor;
and as Divanuras, the builder of Calah, must, Colonel Rawlinson thinks, intervene between the connected series and this king, and as there is no mention on the cylinder either of Calah or Nineveh;
the Colonel is led to believe that the capital of the empire at that early period, that is, before the building of Nineveh, was Kilch Shirgat, as he spells it, itself, and which is everywhere on the cylinder named Assur, as it is also in the well- known sitting figure obtained from the same place by Layard, and now in the British Museum.
This ancient and pre-Ninevite capital of the Assyrian empire being then named Assur, was also, according to Colonel Rawlinson, the Allasar of Genesis, of which Arioch was the king.
It is also the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resell;
and instead, therefore, of Resell being between Nineveh and Calah, it should be Calah, which was between Nineveh and Resen. “ I consider,” adds the Colonel, "these three sites to be now determin­ ately fixed—Nineveh at Nebbi Yunus, Calah at Nimrud, and Resen at Shirgat.
"Notwithstanding such high authority, I cannot help feeling that there will yet be found no reason for thus forcing the reading of the Mosaic record.
The term Assur has been found at Nimrud as well as at Shirgat.*
And it is very likely to apply to the coun­ try rather than to the city.
If, as I suspect it will still turn out to be the case, Nimrud is ever identified by satisfactory paleogra­ phic research with Resen, and Kalah Shirgat with Calah, the Biblical expression will be found to be correct.
Colonel Rawlinson has himself been induced to change his opinions with progressive inquiry, he having in 1839 identified Calah with Holwan near Sar Puli Zohab (Journ. 'of Roy. Geo. Soc. ix. p. 35 et seq.);
and in 1849 or 50, identified the same place with Nimrud.
(Journ. of Roy. Asiat.
Soc. xii. p. 417.)In the “Memoir on Cuneiform Inscriptions," published in the eleventh volume of the Jour.
Roy. Asiat.
Soc., Colonel Rawlinson speaks of Athur-a and Athur-aya as the cuneiform expression for our Assyria.
He then adds in a note, the Arabic geographers always give the title of Athur to the great ruined capital near the mouth of the Upper Zab.
If so, that place is just as likely to be the Tel Assur of the Targums as Kalah Shirgat, and consequently, as far as any identification founded on such data will go-the same as Resen.
RIVER ZABATUS.
Soon after, they arrived at the river Zabatus, the breadth of which was four plethra.
The river Zab is too well known to detain us long.
It is in the present day called Zab Ala.
Thevenot and Tavernier called it Zarb and Zarbe.
It is the Lycus of the older geographers, with the exception of Pliny, who calls it Zerbis, and Marcellinus, who mispells it Diaba.
The Zab is one of the principal confluents of the Tigris, and at certain seasons of the year brings down a larger body of water than the main stream.
There are many tels or mounds of ruin on the south side of the Zab near its confluence with the Tigris, in the plain of Shumanuk, or Shomanok, now tenanted by the Tai Arabs, some of which the indefatigable Layard caused to be excavated by the Jehesh Arabs under his pay.
Among the most remarkable of these is the lofty mound of Kashaf or Keshaf, an artificial platform of earth and unbaked bricks resting upon limestone rock, and crowned by the remains of a deserted fort, — the mounds and ruins called Muk­ hamur or Mokhamour, in the pastoral plains between the Kara­ juk hills and the Tigris—the mound of Abu Jerdah—that of Abu Shitha or Abou Sheetha, and eight others enumerated by Layard, all indicative of a large and prosperous population in olden times.
Speaking more particularly of the mound called Abu-Shitha, Layard says, (p. 225,) "
Near this ruin, perhaps at its very foot, must have taken place an event which led to one of the most cele­ brated episodes of ancient history.
Here were treacherously seized Clearchus, Proxenus, Menon, Agias, and Socrates ;
and Xenophon, elected to the command of the Greek Auxiliaries, com­ menced the ever-memorable retreat of the Ten Thousand.
The camp of Tissaphernes, dappled with its many-coloured tents, and glitter­ ing with golden arms and silken standards, the gorgeous display of Persian pomp, probably stood on the Kordereh, (Kur Darah, valley of Cyrus ?) between Abou Shcetha and the Kasr.
The Greeks having taken the lower road to the west of the Karaehok range, through a plain even then as now a desert, turned to the east, and crossed the spur of the mountain, where we had recently seen the tents of the Howar, in order to reach the fords of the Zab."PASS OF THE ZABATUS.—
Misfortunes awaited the Greeks at this point, and active hostilities ensuing upon the passage of the Zab, that passage was deferred for a short time.
The Persians having been described by Xenophon as taking up a position at the ford over the Zab, I was induced to identify the place of pass­ age, not withstanding its distance from the confluence of the Zab and Tigris, with the ford at Kulak Kupar, which is beyond the ferry called Kulak Izidi, or the pass of the Yezidees.“
The fact of their leaving the Tigris," says the Rev. Mr. Mac­ michael in the Appendix to the Xenophon, (p. 340,) “ and marcit­ ing up the Zab before crossing it, though not expressly stated, la sufliciently indicated by the remark that they arrived at the Tigris near Larissa (iii. 4. 6) after two marches from the ford.
It is also to be added to this, that it seems probable that they crossed above the junction of the Khazir su or Bumadus, as they are de­ scribed as passing on their way to Larissa, a valley formed by a torrent.
”Colonel Chesney makes the Greeks cross the Zab near its con­ fluence, “ probably in boats," (ii. 222).
Layard, who has examined the country about the confluence of the two rivers with great care, says, “ the ford by which the Greeks crossed the great Zab (Zabates) may, I think, be accurately determined.
It is still the principal ford in this part of the river, and must, from the nature of the bed of the stream, have been so from the earliest periods.
It is about twenty-five miles from the confluence of the Zab and Tigris.
A march of twenty-five stadia, or nearly three miles, in the direction of Larissa, would hive brought them to the Ghazer or Burmadus;
and this stream was, I have little doubt, the deep valley formed by the torrent where Mithridates, venturing to attack the retreating army, was signally defeated."
(Discov. in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, p. 60.)
Layard is wrong in saying that “ Mr. Ainsworth would take the Greeks up to the modern ferry, where there could never have been a ford."
I said distinetly (Trav. in the Track, &c., p. 119) the actual ferry is at Kelek Izedi, (or Kulak Izidi,) but beyond this, at Kelek Gopar, (Kulak Kupar,) the river is said to be ford­ able at favourable seasons.
This Mr. Rassam and myself ascer­ tained on the spot.
As it appears, nowever, that there is a ford lower down the river, and yet above the confluence of the Khazir­ su, it is evidently useless to go higher up the river in search of a spot for the passage of the Greeks.
LARISSA.
—Having crossed the Zabatus, the Greeks were only enabled, owing to the hostile front presented by Mithridates, the satrap of the new district they had entered upon, to advance some five and twenty stadia to some villages on the plain.
The next morning they started earlier than usual on account of the ravine, but the Persians did not attack them till they had crossed the torrent, and being driven back, the Greeks travelled the rest of the day without molestation, arriving at the river Tigris, where was a large deserted city, the name of which was Larissa, and which the Modes had formerly inhabited.
The identity of the Larissa of Xenophon with the ruins of Nim­ rud, the scene of Layard's most remarkable discoveries, appearing to be undisputed by those who have written since the publication of the " Travels in the Track," it only remains to notice some facts that have sprung out of more recent researches.
The learned Boehart first advanced the supposition that this Assyrian city was the same as the primeval city, called Resen in the Bible, and that the Greeks having asked its name, were answered.
At Resen, the article being prefixed, and from whence they made Larissa, in an easy transposition.
I adopted this presumed identity as extremely probable, and Colonel Chesney (ii. 223) has done the same—not as an established fact, but as a presumed identity.
Layard was satisfied with looking upon Nimrud as a quarter of Nineveh. "
That the ruins at Nimroud were within the preeincts of Nineveh," he says in Nineveh and its Remains, (vol. ii. p. 243,) " if they do not alone mark its site, appears to be proved by Strabo, and by Ptolemy's statement, that the city was on the Lycus, cor­ roborated by the tradition preserved by the earliest Arab geogra­ phers.
Yakut, and others, mention the ruins of Athur, near Sela­ miyah, which gave the name of Assyria to the province;
and Iun Said expressly states, that they were those of the city of the As­ syrian kings who destroyed Jerusalem.
They are still called, as it has been shown, both Athur and Nimroud.
"Certain cuneiform characters represented in Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, (vol. ii. p. 228, 229,) were, from their frequent recurrence both in the sculptures and the bricks, supposed to re­ present the name of Asshur.
Dr. Hineks deemed them to repre­ sent either the name, or an abbreviation of the name, of Athur, the country of Assyria. "
It is possible," Layard remarks upon this, " that Nineveh, or Athur, may be indiscriminately used in speaking of the country.
"Athor, or Athyr, has also been read by Dr. Hincks as the name of the presiding divinity on the monuments of Assyria, somewhat we suppose, in the same way, only wIth more religious feeling mixed up with it, that Britannia represents Great Britain.
In 1846, Colonel Rawlinson, speaking of Nimrud, noticed it as probably the Rehoboth of Scripture, but he added in a note, " I have no reason for identifying it with Rehoboth, beyond its evident antiquity, and the attribution of Resen and Calah to other sites.
(Journal of Roy.
Asiat. Soc. vol. x. p. 26.)
At this time Colonel Rawlinson identified Calah with Holwan or Sir Pul-i-Zohab, and hesen, or Dasen, with Yasin Teppeh in the plain of Shahrizur in murdistan.
(See note to p. 23 op. cit.)In 1849, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat.
Soc. vol. xi. p. 10,) Colonel Rawlinson said, " The Arabic geographers always give the title of Athur to the great ruined capital near the month of the Upper Zab.
The ruins are now usually known by the name of Nimrud
It would seem highly probable that they represent the Calah of Genesis, for the Samaritan Pentateuch names this city Lachisa, which is evidently the same title as the Λαρισσα of Xenophon, the Persian Υ being very usually replaced both in Median and Baby­ lonian by a guttural.
"In 1850, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat.
Soc. vol. xii.,) Colonel Rawlin.
son added the discovery of a cuneiform inscription bearing the title Levekh, which lie reads Halukh.
"Nimrud," says the distin­ guished palaeographist, " the great treasure-house which has furnished us with all the most remarkable specimens of Assyrian sculpture, although very probably forming one of that group of cities, which, in the time of the prophet Jonas, wore known by the common name of Nineveh, has no claim itself, I think, to that particular appellation.
The title by which it is designated on the bricks and slabs that form its buildings, I read doubtfully as Le­ vekh, and I suspect this to be the original form of the name which appears as Calah in Genesis, and Halah in Kings and Chron­ icles, and which indeed, as the capital of Calaehene, must needs have occupied some site in the immediate vicinity.
"Lastly, in 1853, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat.
Soc. vol. xv. p. vi. et seq.,) Colonel Rawlinson describes the remarkable cylinder before al­ luded to as found at Kilah Shirgat, which establishes that site to have been the most ancient capital of the Assyrian empire, and to have been called Assur as well as Nimrud and Nineveh Proper.
This Assur, wo have seen, he identifies with the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resen;
and instead, there­ fore, of Resen being between Nineveh and Calah, it should be Ca­ lah, which was between Nineveh and Resen.
But, notwithstanding such very high authority, the conclusion thus arrived at does not appear to be perfectly satisfactory.
The discovery of the expression Levekh, and its analogy in the Samari­ tan Lachisa and the Greek Larissa, is very curious and very remarkable, but not conclusive.
The name Assur, or Athur, occurs just as frequently in connexion with Nimrud as with Shir­ gat, and therefore the same argument of its being the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resen, would apply to the one as well as to the other.
It is possible to imagine two cities like Nineveh and Resen to have been within some twenty miles of one another, but it is not so easy to imagine that in after times one was in the province of Adiabene, the other in that of Cala­ chene.
This part of the subject will be found discussed at length in the " Papers of the Syro-Egyptian Society," (vol. i. part ii.).
The whole question indeed regarding Nineveh and Assur ap­ pears to be involved in a great deal of philological confusion.
It is evident that the name of the country came from Assur or Athur, and we cannot therefore feel surprised at finding the name at Ki­ lah Shirgat, afterwards transposed to Nimrud and to Nineveh, just as we find the Chaldean priests using it in the present day in their bibles at Musul or Mausil.
It does not appear, therefore, that any correct data will be derived for naming any of the Assyrian cities from the presence of this epithet.
Then again, with regard to Nineveh, it may at one time have designated one place, at another time another place, according to where the king took up his abode:
and again, it may, in the time of Jonah, have embraced the whole group of cities, as Colonel Rawlinson remarks, in Assyria Proper.
Layard does not dispute that the different portions of Nineveh, thus comprehensively viewed, may have had different names.
Much light has already been thrown upon the history of the different Assyrian cities and edi­ fices, as well as upon the dwellers therein, and that is quite suf­ ficient to show that we are as yet only upon the threshold of what will be eliminated by the labours of our truly zealous and laborious paleographers and archaeologists.
Since the above was written, a letter from Colonel Rawlinson appears in the Athenæum, No. 1381, making mention of the dis­ covery in the S. E. palace at Nimrud, of a perfect statue of the god Nebo, with an inscription on the breast, stating that the figure in question was executed by a certain sculptor of Lakisa or Calah, and dedicated by him to the Lord Phal-lukha, king of Assyria, and to his Lady, Sammuramit, Queen of the Palace.
In the same in­ scription the territorial name of Sutgan is mentioned in conjunc­ tion with that of the city of Calah, being, Colonel Rawlinson says, the title given by the Samaritan interpreter for the Hebrew of Re­ hoboth Ir.
The Colonel identifies the king and queen here no­ ticed together with the Belochus and Semiramis of the Greek As­ syrian lists.
He believes Semiramis to have been the daughter of the king of Medo-Armenia, to have married Phal-lukha, the king of Armenia, when she changed her name from Atossa to Semi­ ramis, and to have reigned with her husband as joint monarch of Nineveh in the eighth century before Christ.
MESPILA.
—From Larissa the Greeks are described as proceed­ mg, in one day's journey, six parasangs, to a large unoccupied for­ tress, situated near a city, the name of which was Mespila.
Upon the data here given, I identified the fortress with the ruins at Yarumjah, and Mespila with Nineveh.
Colonel Chesncy appears to coincide in this view of the subject. " That Larissa and Mes­ pila are represented by the ruins of Nimroud and Kouyunjik," Layard says, (Nineveh and Babylon, p. Gl,) " no one can reason­ ably doubt.
"Colonel Rawlinson however says, (Journ.
Roy. Asiat.
Soc. vol. xii. p. 419,) "
It seems to me very possible, that Xenophon's name, of Mespila may denote Mosul, and not Nineveh."
The term Mes­ pila or Meso-pulai, "middle pass or gates," would certainly appear to apply to the pass of the river between Musul and Kuyunjik or Nabbi Yunus, and there may have been ruins on both banks, for a great mound still exists in Musul, not far from the river, but there is no evidence of such extensive ruins, as are described by Xenophon as being at Mespila, having existed on the right bank of the river, whilst we know they do occur on the left.
Rennell has, however, also conjectured Musul to be derived from Mesulae, a corruption of Meso-pulai.
It does not matter much.
Xenophon's name, no doubt, applied to the pass of the Tigris, and therefore to Musul and Nineveh, and his description of ruins to the latter.
VILLAGES BEYOND MESPILA.
—The Greeks proceeded from the pass of the Tigris, one day's journey, a distance of four parasangs, to some villages where there was plenty of corn.
Fertility is the characteristic of the plain of Nineveh to the present day, and there are no want of villages.
From the data here given, I identified the particular villages at which the Greeks encamped with Tel Kaif, an Assyrian mound with a village or small town at its foot.
Colonel Chesney joins me in this identification.
Layard, however, says, " they probably halted near the modern village of Batnai, between Tel Kef and Tel Eskof, an ancient site exactly four hours, by the usual caravan road, from Kouyunjik."
There is no doubt that Tel Kaifis not above nine geog.
miles from Kuyunjik, and Bat­ nai is twelve.
But this is allowing the full three geog.
miles to the parasang, and that when the Greeks were harassed throughout the journey by Tissaphernes.
Tel Kaif is evidently also an old As­ syrian site, which is not so certain with respect to Batnai, and I therefore, considering all the circumstances of the site, prefer the first identification.
PALACE AND VILLAGES.
—The Greeks remained at the villages on the Assyrian plain the ensuing day, after which they proceeded through the open country, five days' march, till thev came to hills, beyond which was a kind of palace and several villages round it.
The first bills that are met with in proceeding northwards from Assyria to Karduchia, are those which constitute the triple range, designated as the Jibal Abyad by the Arabs, and Cha Spi by the Kurds, both signifying white hille," and immediately beyond them is the castle of Zakhu, with villages around it, like a feudal castle of olden times.
In no part of the journey do the circum­ stances of the case more closely correspond with Xenophon's de­ scriptions, especially of the difficulties met with in passing the hilly range, and the unforeseen opposition they met with in the now wooded valleys between the ranges.
Colonel Chesney (ii. 224) and Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 61) both agree with me in this identification.
It is remarkable that Xenophon does not mention the Khabur, which Dr. Grant confounded with the Chebar of Scripture—the Khabur of Meso­ potamia-althongh he must have crossed that viver either by a ford or bridge.
VILLAGE IN TilE PLAIN.
—There being plenty of provisions at Zakhu, the Greeks remained there three days, and on the fourth they went down into the plain.
Xenophon neglects here to notice either the Khabur or its tributary the Hazil, both of which the army must apparently have crossed.
They are reported as having eneampod at the first village they came to, which I have supposed might correspond with Tel Kubbin, where a mound of ruin marks an ancient site, but Layard does not think they got beyond the Hazil su.
The first village in the plain in the present day is Bidari, inhabited by Chaldeans.
FOOT OF TItE MOUNTAINS.
—The Greeks evidently continued their march across the plain of Zakhu—the Romaion Ager of Procopius—till they reached the foot of the hills south of Jizirah.
A superior knowledge of the country had, however, been turned to account by the Persians in the mean time, and the Greeks, to their astonishment, found the enemy in possession of the heights over wnich they necessarily must pass, whilst the troops of Ariacus and Tissaphernes pressed upon the rear.
The scene of this second conflict in the outlying mountains of Kurdistan I have identified with the low hills which con­ stitute that spur of the Jibal Jndi which advances immediately beyond the plain of Zakhu down to the banks of the Tigris, and where is the now ruinous castle of Rabahi—the Rabdium of the Low Empire, Tur Abdin of Al Wakidis' History of the Conquest of Mesopotamia by the Saracens, and Tur Rabdin of the Jihan Numa.
Colonel Chesney agrees with me in this explanation of mat­ ters, but Layard takes the Greeks (p. 62) all the way to Fynyk or Finik, a view of the subject that will meet with very little support from those who will be at the pains to consider the details carefullyKURDISH PLAIN WITH VILLAGES.
—The Greeks having driven the enemy from the commanding position which they held, they descended into a plain, in which were many villages, stored with excellent provisions, lying along the river Tigris.
This plain ex­ ists precisely in the position indicated, between the Rabahi spur of the Jibal Judi and the low eminences which again block up the plain opposite to Jizirah ibn Umar, the Zozarta of the Chaldeans, and Bezabde of the Romans, and at the farther or northern end of which is the Chaldean village of Mansuriyah.
There was formerly a bridge over the Tigris in this plain, the ruins of which still exist.
The Greeks are described as being much perplexed, for on one side of them were exceeding high mountains, and on the other a river of such depth, that when they sounded it, their spears did not rise above the water.
They were also obliged to retrace their steps to a certain extent.
The Persians having set fire to some of the villages before them, they had to return in search of provisions to some that were un­ burnt.
These villages may have been at the westerly end of the plain of Zakhu, where are in the present day Kalah Salahsani or Sayid Bay's castle, Nahrwan, Girgi Pedros or Afar Yiorgio, (Church of St. George,) Zibarra, Wasit, Perishabur, and other villages mostly Chaldean.
I prefer this view of the case to the one I first entertained, that they went up the valley of Mar Yu­ hannah.
The whole district, however, as Colonel Chesney (ii. 225) justly remarks, included the tract round Jizirah ibn Umar.Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 62) identifies the villages in question with those still found around Funduk, but it appears evident from what follows in chapter i. of the 10th book of the Katabnsis, that the Greeks had not yet fought their way through the chief pass of the Tigris, and which is met with immediately beyond Jizirah ibn Umar and the valley of Mar Yuhannah, or the Dargilah of Layard—Fynyk, ancient Phœnica, command­ ing the pass in question from above.
I cannot but attribute the great discrepancy that occurs here between my identifi­ cations and those admitted by Layard, to the circumstances of his having travelled from the north, I from the south.
Coming in the first direction, Layard first saw the plains of Assyria through the gap made by the river stretching before him, as it were at his feet, from the heights of Funduk, and all other passes were from that moment looked at as insignificant;
coming, on the con­ trary, from the south, the great range of the Jibal Judi seems to Item in the Tigris immediately beyond Jizirah, like a mighty wall of rock.
There is no mistaking this great physical feature in .lie configuration of the country.
The pass of the Tigris, where the Greeks stopped awe-struck at the formidable aspect of the country before them, was at or near the Bezabde of the Romans.
That town has been from time immemorial the fortress which has commanded the great pass of the Tigris.
PASS OF TilE TIGRIS.
—The Greeks are described in the next book as having arrived at a spot where the Tigris was quite impassable from its depth and width, and where there was no passage along its banks, as the Karduchian mountains hung steep over the stream, and hence their further progress became a matter of seri­ ous and anxious discussions.
This is the great pass of the Tigris I have just alluded to imme­ diately beyond Jizirah ibn Umar.
There cannot be a moment's question upon the subject.
It was a point of such great import­ ance in the retreat, that it is made the scene of discussion of all the principal routes that presented themselves to get out of the country, and Xenophon begins another book with the account of the passage of this remarkable pass, which the Greeks effected with their characteristic gallantry and expedition, arriving beyond the summit in certain villages of Karduchians that lay dispersed in the valleys and recesses of the mountains.
It is perhaps scarcely necessary to say that Colonel Chesney quite coincides with this view of the matter.
VILLAGES OF KAUDUCHIANS.
—The pass of the Tigris will be found minutely described in the Travels in the Track, p. 154.
After the summit of the pass is gained, the line of hills and cliffs gradually recede from the river, till suddenly, from having a nearly horizontal stratification, additional beds of rock make their appearance in front of the cliffs, dipping nearly vertically to the west, and rising in rude irregular conical summits, in front of what had been hitherto one continuous wall of rock.
The recesses thus left between the hills are in the present day the seat of villages, as they were in the time of Xenophon, and the crags in front and in the rear bristle with the small and rude rock-forts of the Kurds.
This place cor­ responds to the Phoenica of Amm.
Marcellinus, of the existence of which Mr. Rich obtained some intelligence;
but as I was, I be­ lieve, the first traveller to visit it in modern times, I cannot refrain from quoting the description given of this remarkable spot in the Tray. in the Track, &c. p. 154 et seq."
My surprise and pleasure may be well imagined (after crossing the before-mentioned wild rocky pass) at finding extending before me a considerable expanse of well-wooded gardens, which stretch­ ed from the hills down to the water-side, and for about two miles up the river-course.
Nothing could exceed the rich luxuriance of these groves and orchards;
there were open spaces here and there for maize, melon, gourd, and cucumber, but otherwise the groves of plum, apricot, and peach appeared almost inaccessible, from the dense lower growth of fig-trees and pomegranates, them selves again half hid beneath clustering vines.
Overlooking this scene of vegetative splendour, and upon the side of the hill, were the ruins -if a castellated building, the battlemented wall and irre­ gularly dispersed towers of which still remain.
This building covered a considerable space, being six hundred yards in depth, by eleven hundred in length.
Traces of out-works, and of buildings connected with it, were also quite evident, stretching downward to the gardens."
On two mounds, not far distant from each other, and close to the river, are the ruins of two smaller castles of similar character to the large one, only with double battlements, and consequently rising more loftily trom the deep green groves, in the midst of which they are situated."
In a deep and rocky glen at the head of these gardens is situated the village of Güli or Kuli Shirafi, (so called from its being in a narrow strait or pass,) many of the houses of which are hewn out of rock, and some of them out of fallen masses, which often stand erect at the foot of the cliffs, like great obelisks with a door-way in front:
on the cliffs around are also numerous sepulchral grots, and the remains of aqueducts."
To the north of this glen is another of greater dimensions, in which is the modern village of Fynvk, containing about one hun­ dred houses, many of them excavated.
The village is defended by several Kurd forts, two of which were on the opposite hill-tops, while other small ones succeeded to one another along the crest and acclivities down to the village.
This pass of the Tigris was rendered quite impracticable to strangers by the Kurds of these villages till the time of Rashid Pasha.
"It is manifest that it is these villages to which Xenophon al­ ludes when he speaks of such being in rocky recesses.
Layard however looks for these villages at Funduk (p. 62).
Whilst resting during the heat of day in the gardens down by the river Tigris, Layard was lucky enough to have had informa­ tion brought to him of the existence of sculptures in one of these ravines—the description appears to apply rather to that of Knli Shirafi than to that of Finik or Fynyk proper. "
We rode," he says, (p. 54,) " up a narrow and shady ravine, through which leapt a brawling torrent, watering fruit trees and melon beds.
The rocks on both sides were honey-combed with tombs.
The bas-relief is somewhat above the line of cultivation, and is surrounded by ex­ cavated chambers.
It consists of two figures, dressed in loose vests and trousers, one apparently resting his hand on the shoulder of the other.
There are the remains of an inscription, but too much weather-worn to be copied with any accuracy.
The costume of the figures, and the forms of the characters as far as they can be distinguished, prove that the tablet belongs to the Parthia.
period.
It closely resembles monuments of the same epoch existing in the mountains of Persia.
"What further satisfies me that the glen or ravine which my informants told me was called Kuli Shirafi is the same as that in which Layard found the bas-reliefs, is that Layard adds, " Beneath them (the figures) is a long cutting, and tunnel in the rock, pro­ bably an ancient watercourse for irrigation, to record the construc­ tion of which the tablets may have been sculptured.
"
Layard also discovered some sculptures of a similar character in the valley which leads from Jizirah to Darghilah, the former stronghold of Badir Khan Bay, or as I have called it from a Chal­ dean church, and the seat of a Chaldean episcopacy, the valley of Mar Yuhannah.
These sculptures were about two miles from the high road, near a small fort built by Mir Saif-ad-din, the hereditary chief of Buhtan, in whose name Badir Khan Bay exercised his authority.
There were two tablets, one above the other;
the upper contained a warrior on horseback, the lower a simple figure.
Al­ though no traces of inscription remain, the bas-relief may confi­ dently be assigned to the same period, Layard says, as that of Fynyk.
PASS OF SCRUTINY.
—Beyond Finik, or Fynyk, the hills and the river recede from one another, the latter being closed up amidst precipitous cliffs, and to avoid this long precipitous bend, the road is carried over the hills by the village of Finduk or Funduk.
As the Greeks did not start from Finik till after breakfast, more than seven to eight geographical miles cannot be allowed to the first day's march thence, which would carry them to the slope of those heights where are now the remains of Kunakti and other castles, which defended the approach to Finduk.
There is only one pass in the line of road thus traversed, adapted for the purposes men­ tioned by Xenophon, of examining the men in a file, and scrutiniz­ ing their baggage or impedimenta, and that is the ravine of the rivulet of Zawiyah, which is deep and narrow, and to which there is only one descent on either side, the remainder being vertical cliffs in which are here and there a sepulchral grotto.
PASS OF FINDUK.
—On the next day a great storm arose in the very place to expect such, on the ascent of the highlands of Fin­ duk;
but they were obliged to go on, for their provisions failed them.
Beyond the castle of Kunakti, the road enters a narrow glen, and winds round along similar passes, till turning the face of a lofty precipice, it advances upon more open and cultivated high­ lands by the village or town of Finduk, down again into the valley of the Tigris, where are the villages of Kuwarru, Baravan, and others, inhabited in the present day by Syrian Christians.
Layard gives an amusing account of his passage through Fin­ duk, whose inhabitants, he says, during the rule of Badir Khan Bay were notorious amongst even the savage tribes of Buhtan, for their hatred and insolence to Christians.
At the time of my visit Badir Khan had not been subdued, and the dangers of the road were proportionably greater, but the only annoyance the savage old chieftain Rasul gave me, (if it can be even so termed,) was to ask me contemptuously if I was a Christian.
The Greeks were subjected to much annoyance by the Kurde on this passage, and Xenophon was irritated at Cheirisophus hastening, as he deemed, too rashly forward;
but the rival leader pointed to the river pass and mountains before him, and urged the necessity of haying hurried forward to secure the position they were in.
That this was on the banks of the Tigris is evidenced by a prisoner they had taken, promising, under fear of death, to lead them over the hills, instead of by the river-banks, which are indeed at this point impassable, except when the waters are low, besides being commanded by the neighbouring hills.
PASS OF KULAK.
—At the point where they had now arrived then, that is, where the Tigris is hemmed in by the mountains, and yet there is no short cut over the latter, as at Finduk;
the Greeks were obliged to detach a party to take possession of the heights before they could attempt to force the passage below.
Notwith­ standing these precautions, the Kurds rolled down great stones upon the Greeks and entailed considerable delay.
The scene of this event appears to have been at the entrance of the pass, where is a ferry and villages on each side of the river known as Kulak, as is also the ferry on the Zab—pronounced by the Kurds, Kelek or Chelek.
At this point a rivulet of clear water flows into the Tigris, by a narrow ravine, which is hemmed in, as the Tigris is also from this point northwards, by perpendicular rocks.
A road, carried up in part by steps cut in the rock, leads up the eliff to the ruins of a eastle that once commanded this im­ portant position.
To gain this pass, the Greeks had to fight three separate con. flicts, on as many distinct eminences;
after which they arrived at a number of good houses, and in the midst of abundance of pro­ visions.
Wine was so abundant, that they kept it in excavations under ground, which were plastered over.
On emerging from the hills that hem in the river below Kulak, there are at the present day no villages close to the river, but there are several in the interior, and a little farther on the ruins of a large village, and of a Khan built of stone.
Kulak, with its tall Kurdish castle, stands on the right bank of the river, a little far­ ther on.
The plastered cisterns noticed by Xenophon are still to be met with in Kurdistan, Armenia, and Syria.
THE CENTRITES—The next day the Greeks pursued their way one party as usual ascending the mountains from behind to drive the enemy away, and leave the passage below free to their com­ rades.
By these means they were enabled to force another wooded and picturesque pass, that is met with north of Kulak, and to reach the more open country where the ISuhtan chai or Centrites joins the Tigris.
The army did not encamp on the banks of the Centrites, but, as is described by Xenophon, above the plain, where are some villages of Chaldeans in the present day.
At the point of junction of the Tigris and Centrites is the ancient Armenian site of Til, or Till, (written by Layard, Tilleh,) which was celebrated in history as fa­ voured by Tigranes, and as the burial-place of several of the early Armenian pontiffs.
Layard having got the Greeks on their first day's march over the Karduchian hills, as far as Finduk, he says, “There now re­ mained about ten parasangs to the plain through which flows the eastern branch of the Tigris;
but the country was difficult, and at this time of the year (nearly mid-winter) the lower road along the river was impassable.
The Greeks had therefore to force their way over a series of difficult passes, all stoutly defended by warlike tribes.
They were consequently four days in reaching the Cen­ trites, or eastern Tigris, the united waters of the rivers of Bitlis, Sort, and Bohtan."
FORD OF TilE CENTRITES.
—The passage of the river was op­ posed by an united army of Armenians, Mardians, or, as it was previously read, Mygdonians, and Chaldeans.
These mercenaries were drawn up on high banks, three or four hundred feet from the river;
and the only road that was visible, was one that led up­ ward, apparently a work of art, and the Greeks attempted to cross the river at this point, but without success.
They in consequence retreated, and when they had encamped on the banks of the river, they found their previous station occupied by the Kurds.
That day, therefore, and the following night they remained where they were in great perplexity.
But the next morning two young men came to Xenophon, when he was at breakfast, and told him they had found a ford.
This ford was at a distance of about four stadia, and the Greeks effected the passage by a series of ingenious manoeuvres which are described in the text.
Layard, who forded the Buhtan chai in the month of September I believe, (he disembarked at Trebizond on the 31st of August,) says, “ We crossed the lower or eastern ford, which we found wide and exceedingly rapid, the water, however, not reaching above the saddle-girths.
The villagers raised the luggage, and supported the horses against the current, which rushing over loose and slippery stones, affording an uncertain footing, threatened to sweep the animals down the stream.
* * The spot at which we crossed was one of peculiar interest.
It was here that the Ten Thousand in their memorable retreat forded this river, called, by Xenophon, the Centrites (p. 49).
The next paragraph but one he says, " The ford was deep, and its passage disputed by a formidable force of Armenians, Mygdonians, (Mardians?) and Chaldeans, drawn up on an emi­ nence 300 or 400 feet from the river.
In this strait Xenophon dreamt that he was in chains, and that suddenly his fetters burst asunder of their own accord.
His dream was fulfilled when two youths casually found a more practicable ford, by which the army after a skilful stratagem on the part of their commander, safely reached the opposite bank.
These two paragraphs contradict one another.
Layard also says at page 63, “The stream was rapid, the water reaching to the breast, and the ford, owing to the unevenness of the bot­ torn and the loose slippery stones, exceeding difficult;
such, it will be remembered, we found to be the case near Tilleh.
The opposite banks were, moreover, defended by the combined forces of the Armenians, Mygdonians, and Chaldeans.
It was impossible to cross the river at this spot in the face of the enemy.
At length a ford was discovered higher up, and Xenophon, by skilful strategy, effected the passage.
This must have been at a short distance from Tilleh, as the river, narrowed between rocky banks, is no longer fordable higher up.
”This latter statement is founded in error, for Mr. Rassam and myself forded it a few miles higher up, in the month of September, when the water was in its deepest part not above three feet, but generally two.
Supposing the Greeks to have first attempted the ford at Til, it is evident, according to Layard's own showing, that they crossed ultimately higher up the river.
But the fact is that the point at which the Greeks passed must be determined by where they first reached the river-banks.
On reaching the plain of the Centrites, the Tigris makes a great bend to the westward before receiving the Centrites, and as the course of the Greeks lay northward, conceive it very unlikely that they would have turned unneces sarily out of their way towards the junction of the two rivers.
Again, at the point where they approached the river, the enemy is described as occupying high banks from 300 to 400 feet from the river.
This description would correspond with that part of the valley where the Buhtan chai is first hemmed in by low hills, now called Janiminiyah.
About four miles beyond this there are in the pre­ sent day the ruins of a bridge, over which lay formerly the road to Radwan.
Beyond this again is an artificial causeway carried up the face of a limestone rock, partly by steps cut out of the rock tself, and partly by a causeway paved with large blocks of stone.
This is the high-way to Sa'art, and appears to be of remote anti­ quity.
Here is also a ford, but as the river is fordable at its em­ bouchure, it is evident there may be many fords between the two.
It is not necessary to presume then that the higher ford was crossed, although the reference to the artificial causeway carried up the face of the cliffs, and which remains to the present day, is very curious;
but as it appears almost certain that they did not approach the river till where it is hemmed in by low hills, and which is precisely what they would be expected to do from the route taken and the configuration of the valley, and as they crossed about four stadia above that point, the place where the Greeks forded the river was manifestly beyond the said low nills.
PALACE OF ARMENIAN SATRAP.
-Having forced the passage of the Centrites, the Greeks are described as proceeding through Armenia, over plains and gently sloping hills, a distance of not less than five parasangs, arriving ultimately at a village of con­ siderable size, which contained a palace for the satrap ;
upon most of the houses there were towers, and provisions in great plenty.
This spot, by the distance given, would appear to correspond with the town now called Sa'art or Se'ert.
TilE TELEBOAS.
—The Greeks are described as advancing from the palace of the Armenian satrap, two days' journey, a distance of ten parasangs, until they passed beyond the sources of the river Tigris.
From hence they advanced, three days' journey, fifteen parasangs, to the river Teleboas, a stream not large, indeed, but of much beauty;
and there were many villages on its banks.
This part of the country was called Western Armenia.
There is a difficulty about the identification of the Teleboas, which has been revived by Mr. Layard's going back to the old view of the case.
My ideas, as propounded from an unbiassed consideration of the facts of the case, are given in the “Travels in the Track, &c.,” in the following words.
“Had the Greeks marched by the great road from Sa'art to Bitlis, the distance here given at the onset would take them to the difficult pass called the Darah i Tasul, when they would leave behind them the minor tributaries to the Kharzan su, (anc. Arsa­ nius,) but only to arrive, after another ascent and descent, at the river Bakiyah or of Bitlis, the greatest of the easterly tributaries to the Tigris.
So that Xenophon could hardly be expected to have made the mistake regarding the passing the sources of the Tigris, besides that the distance given from his passing the head- waters of the Tigris, to the river Teleboas, much exceeds the distance of the Darah-i-Tasul from the Bakiyah river.
Lastly, the Teleboas was a small river with many villages on its banks, the Bakiyah is not large, but is so goodly a stream, that the his­ torian would not have gone out of his way to describe it as small, nor is it a district in which (except at Bitlis) many villages pro­ bably ever existed.
All these circumstances taken into consider­ ation leave no doubt that the Greeks ascended directly towards the great chain of the Ali Tagh, the ancient Niphates, in a direc­ lion nearly north;
by which proceeding, a journey of thirty miles would have carried them beyond the head-waters of the tributaries to the Tigris, in those districts, and another forty-five miles would have brought them into the valley of the Kara-su, recognised by many as the Teleboas of our author, and situate in the district of Moxoene, the present Mush,—apparently from the most remote times the seat of numerous towns and villages, and having a large population.
That this is the only version that can be given to this portion of the narrative, is further corroborated by the fact that from the Teleboas they proceeded through a plain which would not apply itself to the river Bakiyeh, (nor to the river of Bitlis,) both of which are enclosed in deep and wooded mountain valleys.
”Colonel Chesney's view of the subject is as follows. “
It is con­ sidered to be a journey of thirty-eight hours from Se'rt to Mush by the shortest route, (see Colonel Sheil's Journey from Tabriz through Kurdistan, Jour. of Roy. Geo. Soc. vol. viii. p. 77,) but as the Greeks approached the source of the Tigris, theirs must have been rather longer.
About twenty hours would be consumed on their march to the high ground in question;
and about twenty hours more in reaching the supposed Teleboas or Kara-su at the village of Arisban near Mush.
”This is the most satisfactory explanation of all, because by crossing the Niphates to Mush instead of to the valley of the Ka­ ra su at the foot of the Nimrud Tagh, the Greeks would have had the advantage of the high-way from Hazu to Mush.
It may also be observed here, that had the Greeks intended keeping to the country of the Kardnchians, and passing the mountains by Bitlis, they need not have fought their way over the Centrites;
and Xenophon, when he speaks of passing above Tigris, was, there is every reason to believe, well enough aware that he was crossing the great water­ shed.
The historian also distinguishes the country they had ad­ vanced into as a different region of Armenia, under its own satrap.
In the face of all these facts, Layard says, " Six marches, of five parasangs each, brought them to the small river Teleboas.
I am convinced that this river cannot be identified with the Kara su, which would be at least between forty and fifty parasangs, or from eight to ten days' march, from Tilleh, supposing Xenophon to have made the smallest possible deviation to the west."
(This is sup­ posing the Greeks to have started from Tilleh, which is not pro­ bable, and then to have travelled to the Kara su by way of Bitlis, which is left out of the consideration.) “ I believe," continues Layard, “ the Teleboas to have been the river of Bitlis.
After cross­ ing the low country of Kharzan, well described by Xenophon as 'a plain varied by hills of an easy ascent,' the Greeks must neces­ sarily have turned slightly to the eastward to reach the Bitlis val­ ley, as inaccessible mountains stopped all further progress."
This is not the case;
Colonel Sheil, as before quoted, describes a road from Sa'art of thirty-eight hours to Mush direct, which does not pass through Bitlis :
and the Colonel adds, " this must be the road which Macdonald Kinneir supposes the Ten Thousand to have taken after they crossed the river, which he calls the Khabur, nt Se'rt." (Op. cit. p. 77.)
Viscount Pollington passed through the Niphates on his journey from Erzrum to Aleppo in 1838;
and Mr Consul Brant did the same on his journey from Kharput by Mush to Bitlis.
This was by the valley of the Kolb su, (Handle water,) but Mr. Brant says there was another road crossing theImmediately south of Mush.
(See Journ. of Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. n. p. 445 et seq. and p. 352 et seq.)
Either of those roads would have been preferable to the mountain route through Kurdistan b) Bitlis, to the Greeks.
Mr. Layard remarks, that the text of Xenophon describes the Greeks as coming to, not crossing, the Teleboas.
This would ap­ ply itself alike to the origin of the Kara-su at the foot of the Nim­ rud Tagh—to the rivulet of Mush or Ak su—the White Water-a tributary to the Kara-su, or to the rivulet at Kizil Aghaz on the north side of the Kolb Tagh.
It would scarcely apply to the rivet of Bitlis, with which they would have had to keep company some time.
Beyond either of the above rivers there are plains, not so at the head of the Bitlis river, and all these rivers are beyond the water-shed of the Tigris, which is not the case with the river of Bitlis.
PALACE OF TIRIBAZUS.
—The Greeks proceeded from the Tele­ boas three days' march, a distance of five parasangs, through a plain, till they came to a palace, with several villages around it, stored with abundance of provisions.
The direction followed by the Greeks, after reaching the plains of Armenia, must be chiefly judged of by the time spent before they crossed the Euphrates.
Had they pursued a direct northerly course, they could have reached the river in a day's march, but at a point where it is searce­ 'y fordable.
Probably they were informed of this fact, and hence led to pursue a north-easterly course to where the river was suf­ ficiently fordable, and which was not attained till the sources of the river lire described as being not far off.
The palace of Tiribazus and surrounding villages may, from the distance given, be at or near the sites of Perak or Lis, north of Lake Nazuk, but this, in the absence of corroborative information, is naturally a merely speculative suggestion.
The plain of Mush attains an average elevation, from my own observations, of 4200 ft. above the sea, which is some 1800 ft. below that of Arzrum, vulgo Erzrum, Erzerum, and Erzeroom.*
But between the two, or the valleys of the western Euphrates and that of the Murad su, the generality of the valleys and uplands which attain their culminating point in the Bin gill Tagh—the mountain of a thousand lakes—the Abus of the Romans—and on which are patches of perpetual snow, art much higher.
The knowledge which we now possess of the great elevation of these Armenian uplands explains the extreme severity of the win­ ters, which has been the subject of much controversy;
so much so, that Tournefort, the traveller and botanist, suggested that it might be owing to so unnatural a cause as the impregnation of the soil with sal-ammoniac.
Positive elevation, in which the immediate re­ lulls of a lower temperature are increased by a continental climate, and a long continuity of open woodless tracts, appear to be the main causes of the phenomena in question.
The Hon. Mr. Curzon, who spent the winter of 1842-43 at Ar­ zrum, speaking of the intense cold experienced at that city, the present capital of Armenia, says, “ During great part of the year.
and naturally in the winter, the cold was so severe that any one standing still for even a very short time, was frozen to death.
Dead frozen bodies were frequently brought into the city;
and it is common in the summer, on the melting of the snow, to find nu­ merous corpses of men and bodies of horses, who had perished in the preceding winter.
So usual an event is this, that there is a custom, or law, in the mountains of Armenia, that every summer the vil­ lagers go out to the more dangerous passes and bury the dead whom they are sure to find."
(Armenia, &c. p. 162.)
This will give some idea of what the Greeks had to suffer during a winter ionrney across the uplands of Armenia.
FORD OF THE EUPHRATES.
—From these villages an attack was made upon Tiribazus, who held a pass that lay on their way, after which the whole body set forward through deep snow, and tra­ velled three days' journey, through a desert tract of country, a dis­ tance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which they passed without being wet higher than the middle.
“
The sources of the river were said to be not far off.
”Rennell and Kinneir had both remarked that this distance is too great for troops marching through deep snow.
All the proba­ bilities of the case are, however, that the Greeks crossed the Murad su above its confluence with the Char Buhar su, and the river of Khanus or Kalah su, as beyond those points there would be so much the less water.
Layard having taken the Greeks through Karduchia to Bitlis, says, “ the high road from Bitlis to Northern Armenia would lead in exactly thirty hours, or six marches, to the Euphrates, which it crosses near Karaghal.
I believe, therefore, that, after issuing from the valley of Bitlis, Xenophon turned to the westward, leav­ ing the lake of Wan a little to the right, though completely con­ cealed from him by a range of low hills.
Skirting the western foot of the Nimroud Dagh range, he passed through a plain thickly inhabited, abounding in well-provisioned villages, and crossed here by ranges of hills.
The country still tallies precisely with Xeno­ phon's description."
The upper valley of the Kara-su here alluded to, certainly abounds in villages, but I saw no ranges of hills actu­ ally crossing it.
It is, however, commanded by low hills where it takes a westerly turn.
Colonel Chesney (ii. 229) says, " Agreeably to the intention of fording the great rivers towards their sources, (previously expressed.
Anab. iv. l,) the Greeks would necessarily procced from the Tele boas in a north-eastern direction, through a very mountainous tract, till they could cross the Murad Chai:
this could not have been the case before they reached 39° 10' north latitude, or some­ where about seventy miles from the Kara su, which, under existing circumstances, would require the seven marches given by Xeno­ phon.
This would identify the place where the Greeks forded the Mu­ rad su with a position not far beyond the junction of the river of Khanus or the Kalah-su;
as would indeed be deduced from the general facts of the case.
TRIBUTARIES TO THE EUPHRATES.
—From the Euphrates they advanced three days' march, through much snow and a level plain, a distance of fifteen parasangs:
the third day's march was ex­ tremely troublesome, as the north wind blew full in their faces.
The depth of the snow was a fathom;
so that many of the bag­ gage-cattle and slaves perished, with about thirty of the soldiers.
There was plenty of wood at the encampment, which would indi­ cate that they had reached the banks of a river, as it is almost only in such situations that wood is found in this part of Armenia.
The valley most probably of one of the tributaries to the river of Khanus, or, if farther east, a tributary to the Murad su, on the plain of Arishkart.
If in a westerly direction, the distances would lead them to the upper valley of the Kalah su or river of Khanus.
In all these instances a northerly wind would still have blown more or less in their faces.
VILLAGES IN KHANUS DISTRIcT.-From thence they made one day's irregular march through the snow, the men affected with bulimia, snow-blindness, and mortification of the toes.
Five or six geographic miles are as much as can be allowed for such a march:
and at dark they arrived at a village with a rampart.
The satrap residing a parasang off, very possibly at Khanus Ka­ lahsi, which is apart from the villages.
A Thermal spring, it is to be noted, was met with on this day's march.
Xenophon with the rear did not get up to the villages till the next day.
The de­ scription of the houses of the Armenians corresponds with what is observed in the present day, they are in part subterranean, and the live stock herd with the people during these severe winters.
As these Armenians had laid in their stores for the winter, the Greeks found plenty of provisions, including barley-wine, and even grape-wine, in these villages.
Professor Maiden rather sharply criticises this identification of Khanus with the villages in question, adopted by.
Rennell also long previously, but on different grounds. “
There is absolutely nothing," he says, “ according to Air.
Ainsworth's notion of the route, but the existence of villages round the modern castle of Khanus, to identify that district with the group of villages where the Greeks rested a week;
for Mr. Ainsworth goes beyond his author, when he speaks of ‘ the palace of the satrap,' and would fain suppose the modern castle to be on the same site.
”
—The impression I received and still retain, however, is that the women and girls at the foun­ tain, when the Greeks told them that they were going to the satrap, answered by informing them, that he was about a parasang off, meaning thereby, not that he and his army were hovering at that distance, but that his residence was there;
and having read of the palace of the satrap Orontes and of that of Tiribazus a few pages before, I pictured to myself a palace or castle for the satrap of the Khanus district, more especially since the chief of that district dwells in a feudal castle to the present day.
In identifications like these, the traveller often differs from the cabinet geographer or scholar, inasmuch as his identifications are not only founded upon what exists, but that he has also in his mind at the same time what he does not enter into at length, a mass of negative matter as to what does not exist.
The mere bare results thus presented often do not satisfy the critic upon the grounds given.
When he doubts or condemns an identification, however, upon such grounds he does not take sufficiently into consideration, that the territory perhaps presents no other re­ sources.
Thus, for example, in the present instance, it is quite possible that the Greeks held on a due northerly course.
I by no means wish to insist upon the point that they did not do so, as the north wind blew in their faces, and they would, in such a case, reach the upper and watered valleys of the Tag Tagh.
But what has been omitted to be explained in the “Travels in the Track," is that these upper valleys of the Bin Gill Tagh, and Tag Tagh, are utterly unproductive, except of a little short grass, and a narrow fringe or belt of low wood on the banks of the rivu­ lets.
They are neither cultivated nor inhabited.
It seems much more likely, therefore, that the Greeks found villages and cultivation, and heard of a satrap's residence, where there are in the present day villages and a chieftain’s residence, than that they found such higher up the country, where there are none such nor traces of such to be met with, nor a possible culti­ vation to induce the natives to settle at such a point.
THE ARAS.
—After stopping eight days at these villages, the Greeks started under guidance of a native, who, leading them three days' marches without coming to any villages, so irritated Cheiri­ sophus that he struck him, which was the occasion of his running away in the night.
From what follows in the account of their journey, it appears that during these three days the Greeks turned the Tag Tagh, an easterly spur of the Bin Gül Tagh, and reached the tributaries of the Aras.
This they would do travelling from fifteen to twenty geographic miles in the three days.
The Bin Giil Tagh, one of the remarkable mountains of Central Armenia, gives birth to the south, to tributaries to the Murad su, to the west and north-west, to the tributaries to the Western Euphrates, and to the north and north-east, to tributaries to the Aras.
River Phasin or ARAXES.
—After losing the guide, the Greeks are described as proceeding seven days' journey, five parasangs each day, along the river Phasis.
I am indebted for this important correction of all previous versions to Professor Maiden, who has published it in the 7th number of the Classical Museum, April, 1845, p. 36 et seq.
There is, the Professor states, no real ambiguity in the meaning of the word παρά in such a context.
The meaning is the same as in v. 10.
1, ἔπλεον ήμέρας δύο παρα την γη̃ν, " they sailed two days along the coast.
"This being admitted, then, it will be observed that Xenophon, who mistook the Aras for the Colehian Phasis, describes it as only a plethrum, or a hundred feet, broad, where they joined it.
This would show that it was not far from its sources.
With such an indefinite point to start from, and a very uncertain value of the parasang in a journey through snow, it is difficult to measure off 35 parasangs on the map.
Allowing, however, two geog.
miles to the parasang, the utmost that can be done under the circumstances, 70 miles laid down on the map to illustrate the routes by Mr. Ains­ worth, Mr. Suter, Mr. Brant, and Lord Pollington, published in the 10th volume of the Journ. of the Roy. Geog.
Soc., would carry the Greeks to the junction of the Karu su, or river of Oran, with the Aras.
Professor Malden has conjectured, that having mistaken the Araxes for the Phasis, they followed the course of the stream, in the hope that it would lead them towards the Euxine, till, seeing that it continued to flow eastward, they resolved to try a somewhat more direct line.
Now, nothing would have so aroused the Greeks to a sense of the mistake they were labouring under so much as coming to a large river flowing into the Aras from the north, at the very same time that the supposed Phasis took a bend rather to the south of east.
Nothing would be left for them in their de­ spair but (having crossed the Aras at its head) to turn away from it and follow the course of the new river they had come to north­ wards towards its sources.
The distances granted are, however, very great, and the very same reflections may have forced them­ selves upon them at the very first stream they came to which flowed from the north-the river of Hassan Kalah.
This would give a distance of fifty miles direct, and upwards of seventy miles by river from the point at which Mr. Brant and myself crossed the Aras.
That river is already at that point fifty to sixty yards in width, the current rapid, the water reaching above the horse's girths.
See Brant's Journal (Journ. of Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. x. p 344).
If the Greeks passed it to the westward of this, then (which if, not likely, as the Bin Gill Tagh presented an impediment to so doing) the chances of their not having got beyond the junction of the Hassan Kalah tributary, is still further increased.
Colonel Chesney's view of this portion of the retreat is as fol­ lows (ii. 229):
"From hence, (the Murad su,) in a north-western direction, to a point where the river Aras, or Phasis of Xenophon, is generally fordable, namely, at the junction of the Hassan Kalah su and the Bin Gül su, near Kupri Kiui, (Bridge village,) it cannot be less than from seventy to eighty miles;
since the shorter distance from the latter point to the upper part of the Murad su, near Kara Ki­ lisa, (Black or ruined Church,) is sixty-six miles.
"
"It has just been seen, that the distance in question occupied thirteen marches, or, including four days not particularly men­ tioned, about sixty-nine parasangs.
But, as it is to be observed that these were intended to be road distances answering to one hour, it may fairly be presumed, that an army could not accom­ plish much more than about one mile in each, especially through snow so deep that the whole of the specified time must have been consumed between the rivers Euphrates and Araxes;
even the pressing marches through Mesopotamia were less than two miles per hour.
We are told, that it even became necessary to tie bags stuffed with hay to the horses'feet to prevent their sinking."
It is obvious, that if we admit such a judicious estimate of the value of the parasang, under the described circumstances, that the diffi­ culties of explaining the marches between the Euphrates and the Black Sea will be considerably diminished, and that the Greeks, notwithstanding their seven days' journey along the Aras, as estab­ lished by Professor Malden, may in reality have only travelled some thirty-five miles along that river, and not beyond the first westerly—not northerly—affluent, the river of Hassan Kalahsi.
The point at which that river joins the Aras is thirty miles by map from where Mr. Brant and myself crossed the Aras, but it would be a good thirty-five or more by the river.
PASS OF TilE TAOCHI.
—Quitting, it is to be supposed, the Aras, the Greeks advanced two days' journey, ten parasangs;
when on the pass that led over the mountains into the plain, the Chalybes, Tnochi, and Phasians were drawn up to oppose their progress.*
As soon as they had gained this pass, and had sacrificed and erect­ ed a trophy, they went down into the plain before them, and arrived at a number of villages stored with abundance of excellent provisions.
These villages would apparently be situated in the valley of Kara Oran or Kara Osman, which is watered by the Kara su.
Kara Oran ought possibly to be read Kara Wiran, "Black Ruin."MOUNTAIN STRONG-HOLD OF THE TAOCHIANS. —
From hence they marched five days' journey, thirty parasangs, to the country of the Taochi, where provisions beginning to fail them, they at­ tacked one of the fastnesses, which is described as containing no houses, but defended by high rocks, down which the Taochians tolled great stones.
Supposing the country of the Taochians to correspond to that which is in part occupied by the Suwanli or Sughanli Tagh, if the parasang did not amount to more than a mile, in a difficult and hostile country, this journey would have only conducted the Greeks to the head waters of the river of Bardes.
The forest range of the Suwanli 'agii is described by Hamilton as constituting an important and interesting feature in the geography of that part of the country, being the only district in which forests of any extent are to be found for many miles round, and its passage by Bardes and Gushlah is full of natural obstacles.
It is to be observed that traces of the name of Taochi are sup­ posed to be found in the Tauk or Taok of the Turks, and Tuchi or Taoutchie of the Georgian districts.
These people and those of the little Kabarda are said by Captain Stoltzman, as quoted by Colonel Chesney, to still retire occasionally into wattled enclo­ sures.
COUNTRY OF THE CHALYBES.
—Hence they advanced, seven days' journey, a distance of fifty parasangs, through the country of the Chalybes, who had their dwellings in strong places, in which they had also laid up their provisions, so that the Greeks could get nothing from that country, but lived upon the cattle which they had taken from the Taochi.
The distance from the head waters of the river ofBardes to the main tributary to the Arpa chai, is as the crow flies some forty miles, but by following the road to Kars, as the great road does in the present day, and crossing the mountains from liars to the Arpa chai at Kizil Chak Chak, it would be upwards of fifty miles —a fair allowance for the fifty parasangs under the circumstances described in the text.
RIVER HARPASUS.
—The Greeks next arrived at the river Har­ pasus, the breadth of which was four plethra.
Supposing the modern Arpa chai to represent the Harpasus, we have shown, that the point where the Greeks would be expected to touch that river, by the distances given, would be at or where the present high road from Arzrum and Kars to Ardahan and Ahkiskah crosses it at Kizil Chak Chak.
It must be already a goodly river at such a place, but there are no data for giving it a width of four hundred feet.
So much obscurity indeed pervades this part of the route, that I am much inclined to doubt the correctness of the identifica.
tion of the Harpasus of Xenophon with the modern Arpa chai, and with Colonel Chesney and Layard to consider that the histo­ rian applied that name to the river now called the Juruk su or l'choruk su, and which was called in later times the Apsarus and Acampsis.
The Juruk in the lower part of its course would pre­ sent a width fully of four hundred feet.
COUNTRY OF THE SCYTHINI.
—Hence they proceeded through the territory of the Scythini, four days' journey, making twenty parasangs, over a level tract, until they came to some villages, in which they halted three days, and collected provisions.
The distance here given, allowing about
It mile for the para­ sang, would carry the Greeks up the valley of the Arpa chai across the watershed of that river, and down the valley of the river of Olti, a tributary to the Juruk su, to about the site of Olti itself.
Or it is possible that they may have crossed the country that in­ tervenes between the river of Olti and the Araxes in a more direct line to the Juruk su, nearly touching Hamilton's route, at the head waters of the rivers of Narman, Liefgaff, Turtum, and Yani Kiui, a line of country which Hamilton's, and still more lately Mr. Curzon's, descriptions show to be wooded, rocky, precipitous, and most difficult.
CITY OF GYMNIAS.
—From this place they advanced four days' journey, twenty parasangs, to a large, rich, and populous city, called Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent the Greeks a guide, to conduct them through a region at war with the people.
The distance given of twenty parasangs, allowing l½ mile per parasang, would carry the Greeks along the valley of the Olti river and up that of the Juruk su to Ispir or Ispira, a town of great antiquity, described at length by Hamilton in his Researches (vol. i. p. 219 et seq.).
It is to be observed also, that supposing Mount Theches to cor­ respond to Tekiya Tagh, it is about sixty miles thence to Ispir, following the valley of the Juruk su;
this in five days would give an average of twelve miles a day, which the Greeks may well be supposed to have got over in a route that did not present so many difficulties as usual.
It is evident, however, that it will require further corroborative testimony before Gymnias can be admitted to be the same as the modem Ispir.
MOUNT THECHES.
—On the fifth day from Gymnias, distances not given, they came to a mountain, the name of which was The­ ches, and whence, to their great delight, the Greeks saw the sea.
The distance allowed between Mount Theches and the country of the Macrones, which in such a country did not much exceel twenty miles, places Mount Theehes between the Juruk su, the river of Baiburt, and the Kurash Tagh.
It is in the present day called Takiya Tagh, which may be a corruption of Theches.
OY
Theches of it, or it may simply mean the mountain of the monas­ tery.
This is the name also given to it by Hamilton, who adds a sketch of a remarkable mountain castle near Takiya.
Mr. Vivien de St. Martin calls the mountain in his map Hak Mesdjidy Tagh.
This name, like that of Takiya, refers to some holy edifice ex­ isting at the spot, and indicates that tradition has preserved the character imputed to the mountain by Xenophon down to existing times.
COUNTRY OF THE MACRONES.
— From Mount
Theches the Greeks advanced three days' journey, a distance of ten parasangs, through the country of the Macrones.
On the first day they came to a river which divided the territory of the Macrones from that of the Scythini.
On their right they had an eminence extremely difficult of access, and on their left another river, into which the boundary river which they had to cross emptied itself.
Allowing l½ geo. miles to the parasang in this difficult country, the country of the Macrones would correspond to the mountain land that lies between Gumush Khana or the silver mines, and the Kara Darah su, the Hyssus of Arrian's Periplus.
This mountain is called Korash Tagh in Brant's map of 1836.
The river to which they came would appear to correspond with the river beyond Kalah Kiui, or castle village, one of the head tributaries of the Kharshut river, or river of Gumush Khana, into which the river of Kalah Kiui itself flows from the left.
As the Grecks crossed the boundary river above its junction with the river to the left, this very fact of its being in such a direction shows that it must have been a stream flowing westward, and not eastward.
Had it had an easterly flow, and yet been to the left hand, it must have joined the boundary river before the Greeks crossed it.
COUNTRY OF TilE COLCHIANS.
—The Macrones conducted the Greeks through their country for three days, until they brought them to the confines of the Colchians.
At this point there was a range of hills high, but accessible, and upon them the Colchians were drawn up in array.
Having passed the summit, the Greeks encamped in a number of villages containing abundance of pro­ visions.
These villages, from the distance travelled the next day to Trebi­ zond, manifestly correspond with the Greek villages which occupy at the present day the head of the valley, whence a very precipitous road leads down from the Kohat or Kolat Tagh (quære Kulak Tagh, mountain of the pass) of Brant's map, (Journ. of Roy. Geo Soc. vol. vi.,) and the Kara Kaban of Hamilton, and which appeart to have been the range on which the Colchians had posted them selves.
The rivulet in question is called Surmel in Hamilton's map, where one of the villages is marked as Jivislik.
(Kara Kapan and Djevisak of St. Martin's map.)
It is recorded in my own notes as Muhurjï-wooded valley with Greek villages, and a bridge over rivulet, at the foot of the Kara Kapan.
TREBIZOND.
—From the villages of the Colchians, the Greeks proceeded two days' march, seven parasangs, and arrived at Trebi­ zond, a Greek city of large population, on the Euxine Sea;
a colony of Sinope, but lying in the territory of the Colchians.
Here they stayed thirty days, encamping in the villages of the Colchians.
It is obvious that, in sketching out a possible line of travel through the countries of the Taochians, Chalybes, Scythians, Ma­ cronians, and Colchians, a region as yet little investigated, that other explanations might be admitted.
One of these is, that the Greeks took a more central line, between the Aras and the Juruk su.
This is not at all improbable.
Hamilton explored this country from Bardes to Ispira, and found it so mountainous and difficult, as to fully account for a very great lapse of time in traversing it in almost a direct line.
The difficulty that would remain to ac­ count for here, would be the account given of the Greeks having arrived at the Harpasns where it was four plethra in breadth.
But may not this have been the Bardes su or the river of Narman, or some other river, not yet correctly delineated on the maps in the interval between the Juruk su, the Aras, the Olti river, and the river of Kars ?
Colonel Chesney is with a still greater degree of probability inclined to identify the Harpasus with the Juruk su or Tchoruk su—variously designated as the Apsarus and Acampsis by the Romans.
Upon the subject of the prolonged marches made by the Greeks between the Aras and the Euxine, Colonel Chesney offers the fol­ lowing general explanations.
"On the second day after crossing the latter river, (the Araxes,) which Colonel Chesney supposes to have been crossed, as previously observed, near Kupri Kiui, the Greeks discovered the inhabitants of the surrounding countries, namely, the Chalybeans, the Taochians, and the Phasians, assembled to dispute their passage, and occupy­ ing strong ground, probably between the territory of the two last.
Here, as when difficulties of the same kind previously occurred, the eminences were gained by an attack made in the flank by volunteers;
and the disheartened defenders having fled with loss, the Greeks got possession of some well-stored villages in advance.
During the succeeding five marches of thirty parasangs, made through the territory of the Taochians, provisions were scarce, it being the custom of the country people to place their supplies in secret fastnesses, probably wattled enclosures, such as those still in use in the Little Kabarda, and district of Tuchi.
One of these in­ trenchments, containing a number of oxen, asses, and sheep, was, however, taken after a prolonged resistance;
during which the women chose to perish rather than fall into the power of the Greeks.
The latter now proceeded a distance of fifty parasangs through the territory of the Chalybeans to the river Harpasus, which they accomplished in seven marches;
notwithstanding the dime ilties caused by the most warlike and the most troublesome people hitherto encountered.
The system of hostilities pursued chiefly consisted in constantly harassing the rear;
but when pressed in turn, they retreated to fastnesses in which their provisions were secured:
so that the Greeks would have been starved by their systematic and persevering opposition, had it not been for the supply of cattle taken from the Taochians.
The difficulties experienced by Rennell, Ainsworth, and other commentators in following this part of the retreat of the Ten Thou­ sand, will be greatly lessened if it be borne in mind, that the daily marches, through deep snow in January, the army being also harassed by the Chalybeans, must have been very short.
From the supposed crossing-place on the Aras, keeping a little way northward of the direct line, it is about 110 miles to the Tchoruk su (Juruk su) or Acampsis, near Kara Aghatch, which would coincide with the fourteen marches given by Xenophon, as docs also the position of the river in question with the Harpasus;
the last seven marches being, as we are informed, through the country of the Chalybeans, the Chaldeans of Strabo (xii. 549).
This probably was the southern part of the district of Tchildir;
for the Chaldeans, as a separate people, occupied a tract next to the Colchians, which was, however, afterwards extended to Pontus, and formed a considerable kingdom under Mithridates.
Quitting the river Harpasus, twenty parasangs, made in four marches, brought the Greeks to a halting-place at some villages, possibly near the present town of Baiburt, in which they remained three days to obtain provisions.
From hence, apparently proceed­ ing towards the western pass through the great northern chain, they made twenty parasangs in three additional marches, to the rich and well-inhabited city of Gymnias.
Possibly this place may now be represented by the small town of Gemeri on the Kara su, an affluent of the river Frat;
in which case the distance thither, being about 60 miles, would occupy seven or eight marches along the slope of the Paryadres, a branch of the Taurus, or, as it is stated, through the country of the Scythinians.
This appears to be the only trace of that ephemeral power, which commenced with the Sacae or Scythians, on the banks of the Araxes;
from whence the people extended their name and authority over Imiretia, Col­ chis, Georgia, the Caucasus, Media, Persia, and even Palestine;
according to Herodotus, the same people ruled Asia during twenty- eight years.
On leaving Gymnias, the guide furnished by the satrap of the district delighted the Greeks by saying that he would forfeit his head if he did not show them the sea in five marches;
and ac­ cordingly on the fifth day, in ascending the holy mountain of The­ dies, the Greeks gave a tremendous shout of surprise and delight, on finding his promise realized.
The mountain alluded to may be the present Gaur Tagh;
(from the summit of which Colonel Ches­ ney saw the sea in 1831;
) and from thence to Tarabuzun, although the direct distance is not great, the journey occupied five days with good horses.
This was owing to the necessity of passing along what in reality is more a winding chasm than a mountain valley in the ordinary acceptation of the word;
and it is scarcely necessary to observe, that the marches through the mountains of Kurdistan and Armenia often must have presented difficulties and caused delays susceptible of the same kind of explanation.
Gaur
Tagh is not, however, the only mountain in this part of the country from which the Euxine may be seen, for the guide inform­ ed the author that it was visible from three other peaks, namely, the Zigani mountain, two hours N. W. of Godol;
again, with a more extensive view, from Fililein, two hours on the other side of Godol towards Gumish Khanah ;
and, lastly, at the higher peak of Karagul, three hours southward of the latter.
The name of the first, " Infidel mountain," and its position with respect to Tarabazun, claim for it the honour of representing the holy Theches;
the localities also appear to correspond to the de­ seription.
Xenophon tells us that in the first day they came to a river separating the Macronians from the Scythinians;
and on this, which disembogned into another river, the Macronians were drawn up to dispute the passage.
A negotiation, followed by a treaty, produced, however, friendship with that people.
Eleven or twelve miles N. N. W. of Gaur Tagh (visible from thence) is the village of Damajula, which is situated near the meeting of four valleys and two rivers.
One of the latter coming from the N.
W. has remarkably steep banks, rising fifteen or twenty feet, with hills above, of difficult ascent on the eastern side, and a chain of more accessible shoulders on the opposite;
both are covered with firs, and silver poplars of small size.
This valley would have been met during the first day's march from Gaur Tagh, and troops posted on the opposite sides would be with­ in speaking distance, although they must have been complete­ ly separated by the difficult nature of the ravine.
Peace being concluded, the Greeks were conducted by this people during the succeeding three marches through the remainder of their territory;
no doubt following the valleys of Damoulee and Godol, till at the termination of the latter, and about thirty-one miles from Dama­ jula, they entered that of Gumush Khanah, a little northward of the town of this name.
The great and deep valley in question runs northward from chence along the foot of the Colchian mountains for about twelve miles, where an abutment of the latter, called Karakaban, crosses it near Zigani, at an elevation of 5300 feet, and the pass thus formed was occupied in force by the Colchians.
Being in a state of hostility with the latter, the Macronians re­ turned to their own country, a distance of about forty-three miles, which would correspond with the three marches made in a more favourable season (February) than the preceding part of the march.
It is difficult to imagine a stronger barrier or a more formidable position than that which here presented itself, to exercise the ta­ lent and display the unshaken intrepidity of the Grecian chief.
Owing to the nature of the ground, as well as the numbers by which it was occupied, the Greeks, even could they have passed the latter unbroken, would have been out-flanked had they attack­ ed in line.
But Xenophon, without hesitation, turned this circum­ stance to his own advantage, by a master-piece of tactics hitherto unequalled.
The Greeks were formed in eleven columns, three of which, each consisting of GOO targeteers and archers, occupied the flanks and centre;
these ascended the hill at such distances from one another that Xenophon not only outstretched the flanks of the Colchians, but was also prepared to attack them in rear, if, con­ trary to expectation, they had stood the shock and maintained their ground.
At first the Colchians advanced, but before they closed with the Greek columns, they opened right and left, and eventually fled in disorder, abandoning the well-stored villages in their rear.
After three days' halt, suffering from the quantity and nature of the honey, which, from the abundance of the azalea pontica, the rhododendron ponticum, and the hellebore, in this fine country, affects the brain for a time, the Greeks, in two marches of seven parasangs, reached the villages near Tarabuzun (Trebizond).
(Vol. ii. p. 230 et seq.)Colonel Chesney's explanation gains a manifest advantage in simplicity of detail over mine, by his not taking the Greeks out the way to reach the Arpa chai, Hamilton's Harpasus, but it loses it again by going out of the way to the westward to the Gaur Tagh, because the Colonel saw the sea from that point.
It is evident that there must be many heights of the mountains east as well as west of the river of Gumush Khanah, from whence the sea can be discerned.
In this part of the retreat, where probably the points will never be all definitively settled, that explanation which presents the greatest degree of simplicity, and at the same time meets most closely all the exigencies of the case, will be the one which will ultimately meet with the most general acceptance.
M. Vivien de Saint Martin, in his admirable Histoire des Decou­ vertes Gengraphiques, (tome ii. p. 324,) after identifying Gymnias with a village called Djinnis, situated near the left bank of the Eu. phrates, about six leagues from Arzrum to the westward, says:
“The body of the Greeks having left Gymnias or Djinnis, on the Upper Euphrates, must have ascended the Kop Tagh, de­ scended the Massa Deressi (Marsah Darahsi) or river of Baiburt, then re-ascended up the course of the river of Balakhor (Balak Hur, "Fish stream?") to the Takiya Tagh, where the name of Theches is still preserved.
From thence they descended to the upper valley of the Balak Hur, which led them to the precipitous chain of the Kolat Tagh, evidently the same as the mountain of the Colchians of Xenophon;
this chain separates the two water­ sheds, which pour their waters to the south in the Upper Tchoruk or river of Ispir, to the north directly to the Black Sea, towards the coast of Trebizond.
The divers circumstances of the narrative do not appear to us to leave the least doubt upon this itinerary, of which nature has marked the features in an ineffaceable manner in this country of deeply contrasted configurations.
"It is scarcely necessary, but for fear of misconception it may be as well to remark that this identification of the Kolat Tagh with the mountain of the Colchians, upon the strength of the name, will not be received by scholars in this country.
Professor Malden, after recurring to the mistake made by Major Rennell, Kinneir, and myself, in supposing that the Greeks marched seven days after the guide ran away from them before they reached the Phasis;
adds,“Rennell, however, has probably fallen into a further mistake in thinking that the Greeks did not cross the Harpasus;
for this seems to be his opinion.
He supposes that they came to the river between its conflux with the Araxes and the conflux of the river of Kars with the other streams that form it, and then turned back from it towards the west;
so that their subsequent marches for four days were still between the Harpasus and the Phasis or Araxes;
and he is inclined to identify the city of Gymnias with a modern town on the latter river.
Xenophon certainly does not say distinctly that they crossed the Harpasus, but his language implies it.
He says, ‘After this the Greeks arrived at the river Harpasus, which was four hundred feet broad.
Thence they marched through the country of the Scythini,' &c. (iv. 7. 18).
He does not say that they did not cross it, and the notice of the breadth of the river is not much to the purpose unless they did cross it;
and besides, he uses the very same language with respect to rivers which were certainly crossed.
(See i. 4, §§ 9 and 19;
and iv. 4, §§ 3 and 7.)"
But, if they crossed it, it was probably the branch called the river of Kars which they crossed, not the stream below the junc­ tion of this branch with those to the east of it;
otherwise, we should have them still persevering in their mistaken easterly course;
and they would have had to cross the eastern branch on their way back towards the west.
In crossing the river of Kars they would be going northward;
and if they then turned westward, they would fall in with no considerable river till they came to the Apsarus or Shoruk, (Juruk,) which accords with Xenophon's narrative;
the Shoruk being identified with the river of the Macrones.
"After examining all the circumstances of the story, if we sup­ pose the Greeks to have crossed the Phasis at the point which Rennell indicates, near the modern bridge of Koban Kupri, (same as Kupri Kiui,) or perhaps even nearer to its source;
and then, in consequence of their confusion between the two rivers Phasis, to have turned eastward, and marched seven days along its north­ ern bank, and even when they left the river to have inclined but little towards the north, and to have reached the Harpasus about the junction of the river of Kars with the other branches, thus traversing the diagonal of the space between the Araxes and the Arpa-su, we assign them a march, which in winter, through an unknown country, and in the presence of an active enemy, might well occupy the time given for it.
The time is twenty-one days;
and the distance from point to point in a straight line, if the Greeks had not kept to the river-side for the first seven days, would be about 120 miles.
If we admit, therefore, a very reasonable ac­ count of deviation from the direct course, and allow that the length of the days' marches has either been over-rated by Xenophon, or exaggerated by errors of the transcribers, the difficulties seem to be removed.
"The problem which remains is to fix the position of the city of Gymnias north of the river of Kars."
(The Classical Museum, No. vii. p. 41 et seq.)
The most superficial glance at the map published by the Roy. Geog.
Soc. to illustrate routes of Mr. Ainsworth, Mr. Brant, Mr. Suter, and Lord Pollington, in the tenth volume of their Journal, would satisfy Professor Malden that it was along the Bin Giil su or Upper Aras, that the Greeks would have performed their seven days’ journey, and not on the Kalah su, which they joined at Ku­ pri Kiui, where I suppose them to have terminated their seven days' march, having Professor Malden's correction in mind.
I quite agree, however, with the Professor, that the correct determine ation of the position of Gymnias will do much towards elucidating this most abstruse part of the narrative, and the determination may yet be expected, from the constant progress that geographical and archæological research are making in the East.
The question has, indeed, been much narrowed in its cOmpass already, from the day when Rennell conceived that the Greeks, having lost their way, wandered up and down after crossing the Araxes.
A mere intimate acquaintance with the physical charae.
ters of northern Armenia has shown it to be a country peculiarly difficult to travel in-a constant succession of hills and valleys- precipices and ravines-rocky ledges and foaming torrents.
Air.
Curzon, who has given a very picturesque account of some of the difficulties to be met with in travelling from Arzrum to Trebizond, in his little work on Armenia, mentions having met a rich Persian merchant on the 2nd of January, at a hovel called Khaderach Khan, who had been eighteen days on the road from Trebizond, which was thirty-two hours of Tartar posting.
At the pass of Husha-Bunar he also came upon a party of Persians, seated on the ledge of a precipice, looking despairingly at a number of their baggage-horses which had tumbled over, and were wallowing in the snow many hundred feet below.
At the Zigana Tagh, a whole caravan had been overwhelmed in an avalanche.
When these difficulties come to be better appreciated, it will be easy to understand how the Greeks should, in the depth of winter and the natives in open hostility to them, have spent so much time in this part of the country.
“We have not," says Layard, “I conceive, sufficient data in Xenophon's narrative to identify with any degree of certainty his route after crossing the Euphrates.
We know that about twenty parasangs from that river, the Greeks encamped near a hot spring, and this spring might be recognised in one of the many which abound in the country.
It is most probable that the Greeks took the road still used by caravans through the plains of Hinnis (Kha­ nus) and Hassan-Kalah, as offering the fewest difficulties.
But what rivers are we to identify with the Phasis and Harpasus, the distance between the Euphrates and Phasis being seventy para­ sangs, and between the Phasis and Harpasus ninety-five, and the Harpasus being the larger of the two rivers?
I cannot admit that the Greeks turned to the west and passed near the site of the mo­ dern Erzeroom.
There are no rivers in that direction to answer the description of Xenophon.
Moreover, the Greeks came to the high mountain, and beheld the sea for the first time, at the dis­ tance of thirty-two parasangs from Trebizond.
Had they taken either of the three modern roads from Erzeroom to the coast, and there are no others, they must hive seen the Euxine in the im­ mediate vicinity of Trebizond, certainly not more than six or eight parasangs from that city.
I am, on the whole, inclined to believe, that either the Greeks took a very tortuous course after leaving the Euphrates, making daily but little actual progress towards the great end of their arduous journey, the sea-coast, or that there is a considerable error in the amount of parasangs given by Xeno­ phon;
that the Harpasus must be the Tcheronk, (Juruk,) and the Phasis, either the Araxes or the Kur;
and that.
Mount Theches, the holy mountain, from which the Greeks beheld the sea, was be­ tween Batun and Trebizond, the army having followed the valley of the Tcherouk, but leaving it before reaching the site of the mo­ dern port on the Black Sea."
(Nineveh and Babylon, p. 65.)
This is, at all events, an uncompromising statement of the ob­ scurities that envelope this part of the retreat, if it is not a lucid re­ cord of the details.
Colonel Chesney having seen the sea with his own eyes from the Gaur or Jawur Tagh, is an answer to one objec­ tion—that it could certainly not be seen at a greater distance than six or seven parasangs from Trebizond.
With regard to other diffi­ culties, Layard would throw the whole subject back again to the dark .period that preceded the investigations of Rennell and Kin­ neir.
I have endeavoured to show what has been added to those able and conscientious researches, and the patience and zeal of future inquirers will, most assuredly, sift what is good from all these statements, will expunge that which will not stand the test of time, and will arrive ultimately at some clear and satisfactory conclusions regarding these very remarkable Armenian wanderings.
CERASUS.
—The Greeks recruited themselves at Trebizond, till the supplies furnished by the surrounding country were nearly ex­ hausted, and then, only a portion of the necessary shipping having been obtained, they embarked their women and children, with the sick and the aged, under the two oldest generals, Philesius and Sophaenetus, while the remainder proceeded by land;
and in three marches they reached the Greek city Cerasus, or, more correctly, Kerasus.
Hamilton has shown that the ancient Kerasus does not correspond with the modern Kirasunt, but that the site must be sought for at the rivulet of Kirasun Darah su, about eight miles from Cape Yurus, and not quite forty from Trebizond.
Consider­ ing the difficulties of the country, it is not likely, Colonel Ches­ ney remarks, that a greater distance could have been accomplished in three days.
THE MOSSYNOECI.
—The territory of the Mossynoeci or Moschi, in which the Greeks became engaged in a struggle that had nearly been disastrous to them, appears to have stretched from a little dis­ lance westward of Trebizond, to the district of Pharnaeia, or up­ wards of seventy miles along the coast.
The fort or citadel of these fierce people appears to have been in the neighbourhood of Cerasus.
These Mossynoeci—the Mossyni of Pliny and of Pom­ ponius Mela-and who are said to derive their name from the wooden turrets or the trees they dwelt in, are described as being the most barbarous people the Greeks met with during the whole of their journey.
THE CHALYBES.
—The Greeks were eight days travelling through the territory of the Mossynoeci, after which they came to that of the Chalybes.
These were subject to the Mossynoecians, and far from being numerous, they lived by the manufacture of iron, and were mixed with the Tibarenians.
Hamilton found the poor na­ tives of the coast occupied in the present day in extracting iron from the superficial soil, not exactly at this spot, but to the west of Cotyora, and between the ruins of Polemonium and the Ther­ modon, directly south of Uniyah Kalah, ancient Oenoe.
COTYORA.
—Marching through the country of the Tibareni, which is described as being more campaign, and the towns near the sea not so strong, the Greeks came to Cotyora, a Greek city, and a colony of Sinopians, situated in the territory of the Tibare­ nians.
Cotyora was replaced by Pharnacia, which was built, ac­ cording to Strabo, out of its spoils, and hence, in the time of Ar­ rian, was already a mere village.
Hamilton has identified the site with a place called Ordu or Urdu, where are some remains of an ancient port, and Colonel Chesney has accepted the identification.
There are some diffi­ culties in the way of this identification with the distances given by Arrian in the Periplus of the Euxine Sea, which led me to prefer the site of Parshambah.
It is, however, by no means a point to he insisted upon.
SINOPE.
—After discussing the question of forming a Greek set­ tlement on the Euxine, as well as the relative advantages of a homeward voyage by sea, and a march thither by land, the Greeks adopted the former course;
and the Cotyorians having provided the necessary shipping to get rid of their uninvited guests, a fair wind carried the Greeks rapidly along the coast of Paphlagonia, when passing in succession the rivers Thermodon (Thirmah su), Iris (Yashil Irmak), and Halys (Kiz.il Irmak), they landed at Harmene or Armene, a port five miles from the flourishing city of Sinope, once a Milesian colony.
The site of this port and city is too well known to require further illustration.
HERACLEA.-After electing Cheirisophus commander-in-chief, the Greeks sailed from Sinope along the coast of Paphlagonia and Bithynia, to Heraclea, where the army disembarked at the close of the second day's sail.
Xenophon makes the Greeks pass the rivers Thermodon and Halys on this journey, by mistake;
instead of on that from Cotyora to Sinope.
The Greeks came to an anchor near to the peninsula of the Acherusians-the site of one of Hercules’ fabled exploits.
The modern town of Harakli occupies only the south-west corner of the space covered by the ancient city.
The Lycus noticed by Xeno­ phon is called the Kilij su or Sword river, significative of the same thing-its sudden wolf-like or destructive risings.
CALPE.-The Greeks, in their apparent great anxiety for booty —an anxiety which attained its acme as they were getting near home, divided into three bodies.
The Arcadians and the Achae­ ans, mustering about 4500 heavy-armed men, proceeded by sea to Calpe.
while the other heavy-armed men and the Thracian targe­ teers, who amounted to about 2100 men under Cheirisophus, marched along the coast to Thrace;
Xenophon himself, at the head of 1700 heavy-armed men, 300 targeteers, and 40 horsemen, marching, ac­ cording to Colonel Chesney, towards Calpe in a direct line.
I read it, however, through the middle of the country, a phrase which is twice repeated in the account of the journey, and as the district that lies between the shore and the plains of Tuz-cha and Saban­ cha, is occupied by the Yailah Tagh, a densely wooded range of hills, totally impassable to a body of troops, there remained no alternative but to keep to the shore or to take to the middle of the country.
My idea, as expressed in the “Travels in the Track," and which I am still inclined to hold by, is, that Xenophon, in the pursuit of booty,crossed the Yailah Tagh—ancient Mons Hypius,and descend­ ed upon the fertile plain of Prusa ad Hypium, but on nearing of the the straits in which his comrades were placed at Calpe, he re­ turned thither through the westerly prolongation of the same hills.
The promontory of Calpe enjoyed in those times the same name as that of Gibraltar.
It is now called Kirpah or Kafkan Adasi.
CHRYSOPOLIS.
—After a long stay and no small disasters entailed by the restlessness of the Greeks at Calpe, they started from that place, marching through Bithynia, or Asiatic Thrace, as it was also called, six days' march, to Chrysopolis—the Golden city, the mo­ dern Uskudar or Scutari, opposite to Constantinople.
The dis­ lance travelled upon this occasion by road of some eighty miles in six days, gives an average of thirteen miles a day, showing that eight, ten, and twelve were as often assumed ordinary day's jour­ neys, under circumstances of greater difficulties, according to the exigencies of the case, and may indeed have been still less.
The retreat of the Ten Thousand may in reality be said to end at this point, for the kind of business which they became engaged in after crossing the Bosphorus, has nothing to do with that on which they were originally taken from their homes by the ambition of Cyrus.
The Ten Thousand in European THRACE.
—From Chrysopolis the Greeks crossed over to Byzantium, where they were but scur­ vily treated by the Lacedaemonian admiral Anaxibius, and hence obliged to quarter in some Thracian villages.
Xenophon sailed in the mean time to Cyzicus, (now Baal Kiz,) from whence he re­ turned to his comrades, and led them all, except such as remained with Neon and such as had disbanded on finding themselves in Europe, to Perinthus, now Haraldi.
From this point they were induced by large promises to assist Seuthes, son of Maesades, to recover his patrimony as one of the independent kings of Thrace.
In execution of this compact they marched into the country called the Delta of the Thracians, above Byzantium, that of the Melino­ phagi, who dwelt in the eastern part of the Kutchuk Balkhan, (Little Balkhan,) and they arrived at Salmydissus or Kalmydissus, now Midiyah, on the Euxine.
After they had subdued the in- habitants, who lived chiefly by the plunder of wrecks, they re­ turned and encamped on a plain above Selymbria.
The Greeks arrive at PERGAMUS.
—At this point the Greeks parted from Seuthes, who had failed to fulfil his promises made to them, and crossing the Propontis, they repaired to Lampsacns, a well-known port on the Hellespont, now called Lamsaki.
From hence they marched through Troas, and passing over the celebrated Mount Ida, they came first to Antandrus, now Antandros, near Adramiti.
Hence they continued their march along the coast of the Lydian sea, to the plain of Thebes.
It is known, from Herod­ otus and Livy, that the plain of Adramyttium was so called.
Thence they passed through Adramyttium or Atramyttium Cer tonium, which is believed to be the Karene of Herodotus, and Atarne, an Aeolian city-the Atarneus of Strabo, from whence they reached Pergamus, where the narrative of the historian finally ceases.
The whole of the way, both of the Expedition and of the Re­ treat, is said to have comprised two hundred and fifteen days' march, of eleven hundred and fifty-five parasangs, and of thirty thousand six hundred and fifty stadia.
and the time employed iD both.
was a year and three months.
ABYDUS, i. 1. 9. A city of Mysia on the Hellespont, nearly op­ posite Sestus on the European shore.
Aidos or Avido, a modern village on the Hellespont, may be the site of Abydus, though the conclusion from a name alone is not admitted by some critics.

Arabia, i. 5. 1 ;
vii. S. 25.
The term Arabia is used by Xenophon to designate those parts of Mesopotamia which lie south of the river Khabur, the same as are described by Strabo, (i. 2, p. 65;
xvi. 1, p. 351,) as inhabited by the Arabes Scenitae or Nomade Arabs, and which are in the present day chiefly occupied by the Shamar Arabs.
Araxes, i. 4. 19.
There is every reason to believe that what Xenophon calls the Araxes, (a river of Mesopotamia running into the Euphrates,) is the same river that is called Chaboras by Ptolemy and Pliny, Aborras by Strabo, Zosimus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and other writers:
and by the Arabs, the Khabur.
A contributor to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, art.
Chaboras, has however thought fit to question this identification.

there being now a place named Kidonia, near the sup­ posed situation of Certonium.

Tlie two charges on which Socrates was condemned to death by the Athe nians, sect.
1. The first charge refuted by several arguments:
for So­ crates used to sacrifice to the gods, 2;
he practised divination, and his dœmon was no new god, 2—5;
he recommended that the gods should be consulted by man in perplexing circumstances, 6—9;
he was guilty of no impiety, he avoided vain speculations respecting the gods, and said that the business of philosophy was the study of virtue, 10-17;
his life was in accordance with the precepts of morality, 18-20.1.
I HAVE often wondered by what arguments the accusers1 of Socrates persuaded the Athenians that lie deserved death from the state ;
for the indictment against him was to this effect:
SOCRATES OFFENDS AGAINST THE LAWS IN NOT PAYING RESPECT2 TO THOSE GODS WHOM THE CITY RE­ SPECTS, AND INTRODUCING OTHER NEW DEITIES ;
HE ALSO OFFENDS AGAINST THE LAWS IN CORRUPTING THE YOUTH.2
In the first place, that he did not respect the gods whom the city respects, what proof did they bring ?
For he was seen frequently sacrificing at home, and frequently on the public altars of the city;
nor was it unknown that he used divination ;
as it was a common subject of talk, that “Socrates used to say that the divinity instructed him;
" and it was from this circumstance, indeed, that they seem chiefly to have derived the charge of introducing new deities.
3. He how­ ever introduced nothing newer than those who, practising divination, consult auguries, voices,1 omens, and sacrifices ;
for they do not imagine that birds, or people who meet them, know what is advantageous for those seeking presages, but that the gods, by their means, signify what will be so ;
and such was the opinion that Socrates entertained.
4. Most people say that they are diverted from an object, or prompted to it, by birds, or by the people who meet them ;
but Socrates spoke as he thought, for he said it was the divinity that was his monitor.
He also told many of his friends to do certain things, and not to do others, intimating that the divinity had forewarned him;
and advantage attended those who obey­ ed his suggestions, but repentance, those who disregarded them.
5.
Yet who would not acknowledge that Socrates wished to appear to his friends neither a fool nor a boaster ?
But lie would have seemed to be both, if, after saying that intima­ tions were given him by a god, he had then been proved guilty of falsehood.
It is manifest, therefore, that he would have uttered no predictions, if he had not trusted that they would prove true.
But who, in such matters, would trust to any one but a god ?
And how could he, who trusted the gods, think that there were no gods ?
26. He also acted towards his friends according to his con­ victions, for he recommended them to perform affairs of ne­ cessary consequence1 in such a manner as he thought that they would be best managed;
but concerning those of which it was doubtful how they would terminate, he sent them to take auguries whether they should be done or not.
7. Those who would govern families or cities well, he said, had need of divination ;
for to become skilful in architecture, or working in brass, or agriculture, or in commanding men, or to become a critic in any such arts,2 or a good reasoner, or a skilful regu­ lator of a household, or a well-qualified general, lie considered as wholly matters of learning, and left to the choice of the human understanding;
s. but he said that the gods reserved to themselves the most important particulars attending such matters, of which nothing was apparent to men ;
for neither was it certain to him who had sown his field well, who should reap the fruit of it ;
nor certain to him who had built a house well, who should inhabit it;
nor certain to him who was skilled in generalship, whether it would be for his advantage to act as a general;
nor certain to him who was versed in political affairs, whether it would be for his profit to be at the head of the state ;
nor certain to him who had married a beautiful wife in hopes of happiness, whether he should not incur misery by her means;
nor certain to him who had acquired powerful connexions in the state, whether he might not be banished by them:
9. and those who thought that none of these thing,;
depended on the gods, but that all were dependent on the human understanding, he pronounced to be insane ;
as he also pronounced those to be insane who had recourse to omens re­ specting matters which the gods had granted to men to dis cover by the exercise of their faculties;
as if, for instance, a man should inquire whether it would be better to take for the driver of his chariot, one who knows how to drive, or one who does not know;
or whether it would be better to place over his ship one who knows how to steer it, or one who does not know;
or if men should ask respecting matters which they may learn by counting, or measuring, or weighing;
for those who inquired of the gods concerning such matters he thought guilty of impiety, and said that it was the duty of men to learn whatever the gods had enabled them to do by learning, and to try to ascertain from the gods by augury whatever was obscure to men ;
as the gods always afford in­ formation to those to whom they are rendered propitious.
in.
He was constantly in public, for he went in the morning to the places for walking and the gymnasia;
at the time when the market was full1 he was to be seen there;
and the rest of the day he was where he was likely to meet the greatest number of people;
he was generally engaged in discourse, and all who pleased were at liberty to hear him;
11.
yet no one ever either saw Socrates doing, or heard him saying, any­ thing impious or profane;
for lie did not dispute about the nature of things as most other philosophers disputed,2 specu­ lating how that which is called by sophists the world was produced, and by what necessary laws everything in the hea­ vens is effected, but endeavoured to show that those who chose such objects of contemplation were foolish;
12.
and used in the first place to inquire of them whether they thought that they already knew sufficient of human affairs, and therefore proceeded to such subjects of meditation, or whether, when they neglected human affairs entirely, and speculated on celes­ tial matters, they thought that they were doing what became them.
13. He wondered, too, that it was not apparent to them that it is impossible for man to satisfy himself on such points, since even those who pride themselves most on dis­ cussing them, do not hold the same opinions one with another, but are, compared with each other, like madmen ;
14.
for of mad­ men some have no fear of what is to be feared, and others fear what is not to be feared ;
some think it no shame to say or do anything whatever before men, and others think that they ought not to go among men at all;
some pay no respect to temple, or altar, or anything dedicated to the gods, and others worship stones, and common stocks, and beasts:
so of those who speculate on the nature of the universe, some imagine that all that exists is one, others that there are worlds infinite in number;
some that all things are in perpetual motion, others that nothing is ever moved;
some that all things are generated and decay, and others that nothing is either gener­ ated or decays.
15.
He would ask, also, concerning such philosophers, whether, as those who have learned arts practised by men, expect that they will be able to carry into effect what they have learned, either for themselves, or for any one else whom they may wish, so those who inquire into celestial things, imagine that, when they have discovered by what laws every­ thing is effected, they will be able to produce, whenever they please, wind, rain, changes of the seasons, and whatever else of that sort they may desire, or whether they have no such expectation, but are content merely to know how everything of that nature is generated.
to.
Such were the observations which he made about those who busied themselves in such speculations ;
but for himself, he would hold discourse, from time to time, on what concerned mankind, considering what was pious, what impious;
what was becoming, what unbe­ coming;
what was just, what unjust;
what was sanity, what insanity;
what was fortitude, what cowardice;
what a state was, and what the character of a statesman ;
what was the nature of government over men, and the qualities of one skilled in governing them;
and touching on other subjects, with which he thought that those who were acquainted were men of worth and estimation, but that those who were ignor­ ant of them might justly be deemed no better than slaves.
17.
As to those matters, then, on which Socrates gave no intimation what his sentiments were, it is not at all wonderful that his judges should have decided erroneously concerning him;
but is it not wonderful that they should have taken no account of such things is all men knew ? is.
For when he was a member of the senate, and had taken the senator's oath, in which it was expressed that he would vote in accordance with the laws, he, being president in the assembly of the people when they were eager to put to death Thrasyllus, Erasinides, and all the nine generals, by a single vote con­ trary to the law, refused,!
though the multitude were en­ raged at him, and many of those in power uttered threats against him, to put the question to the vote, but considered it of more importance to observe his oath than to gratify the people contrary to what was right, or to seek safety against those who menaced him;
19.
for he thought that the gods paid regard to men, not in the way in which some people suppose, who imagine that the gods know some things and do not know others, but he considered that the gods know all things, both what is said, what is done, and what is medi­ tated in silence, and are present everywhere, and give ad­ monitions to men concerning everything human.20.
I wonder, therefore, how the Athenians were ever per­ suaded that Socrates had not right sentiments concerning the gods ;
a man who never said or did anything impious towards the gods, but spoke and acted in such a manner with respect to them, that any other who had spoken and acted in the same manner, would have been, and have been considered, emi­ nently pious.
Reply to the other charge against Soerates.
He did not corrupt the youth, for his whole teaching dissuaded them from vice, and encouraged them to tem­ perance and virtue of every kind, sect.
1-8. He exhorted them to obey the laws, 9—11.
If Critias and Alcibiades, who listened to his discourses, became corrupt, the fault was not his, 12—28;
he endeavoured to reclaim them, till they deserted him;
and others, who resigned themselves wholly to his instructions, became virtuous and honourable men, 28—48.
Other frivolous assertions refuted, 49—60.
His benevolence, disinterestedness.
and general merits, 61—61.I.
IT also seems wonderful to me, that any should have been persuaded that Socrates corrupted the youth;
Socrates, who, in addition to what has been said of him, was not only the most rigid of all men in the government of his passions and appetites, but also most able to withstand cold, heat, and every kind of labour ;
and, besides, so inured to frugality, that, though he possessed very little, lie very easily made it a sum­ ciency.
2. How, then, being of such a character himself, could he have rendered others impious, or lawless, or luxuri­ ous, or incontinent, or too effeminate to endure labour ?
On the contrary, he restrained many of them from such vices, leading them to love virtue, and giving them hopes, that if they would take care of themselves, they would become hon­ ourable and worthy characters.
3. Not indeed that he even professed to be an instructor in that way, but, by showing that he was himself such a character, he made those In his society hope that, by imitating him, they would become such as he was.
4.
Of the body lie was not neglectful, nor did he commend those who were.
He did not approve that a person should eat to excess, and then use immoderate exercise, but recom­ mended that he should work off, by a proper degree of exer­ cise, as much as the appetite received with pleasure ;
for such a habit, he said, was peculiarly conducive to health, and did not prevent attention to the mind.
5. He was not, however, fine or ostentatious in his clothes or sandals, or in any of his habits of life;
yet he did not make those about him lovers cf money,1 for he checked them in this as well as other passions, and asked no remuneration from those who desired his com­ pany.
6. By refraining from such demand, lie thought that he consulted his liberty, and called those who took money for their discourses their own enslavers, since they must of neces­ sity hold discussions with those from whom they received pay.
7. He expressed wonder, too, that any one who pro­ fessed to teach virtue, should demand money, and not think that he gained the greatest profit in securing a good friend, but fear that he whom he had made an honourable and worthy character would not retain the greatest gratitude towards his greatest benefactor.
8. Socrates, indeed, never expressed so much to any one ;
yet he believed that those of his associates who imbibed what he approved, would be always good friends both to himself and to each other.
How then could a man of such a character corrupt the young, unless, indeed, the study of virtue be corruption ?9.
"But assuredly," said the accuser, "he caused those who conversed with him to despise the established laws, by saying how foolish it was to elect the magistrates of a state by beans,1 when nobody would be willing to take a pilot elected by beans, or an architect, or a flute-player,2 or a person in any other profession, which, if erroneously exercised, would cause far less harm than errors in the administration of a state;
” and declared that such remarks excited the young to con­ temn the established form of government, and disposed them to acts of violence."
10. But I think that young men who exercise their understanding, and expect to become capable of teaching their fellow-citizens what is for their interest, grow by no means addicted to violence, knowing that on violence attend enmity and danger, but that, by persuasion, the same results are attained without peril, and with good- will;
for those who are compelled by us, hate us as if despoiled of something, while those who are persuaded by us, love us as if they had received a favour.
It is not the part, there­ fore, of those who cultivate the intellect to use violence;
for to adopt such a course belongs to those who possess brute force without intellect, 11.
Besides, he who would venture to use force, had need of no small number of allies, but lie who can succeed with persuasion, has need of none, for, though left alone, he would think himself still able to persuade ;
and it by no means belongs to such men to shed blood, for who would wish to put another man to death rather than to have him is a living subject persuaded to obey?
12. "But," said the accuser, "Critias and Alcibiades, after having been associates of Socrates, inflicted a great number of evils on the state;
for Critias was the most avaricious and violent of all that composed the oligarchy, and Alcibiades was the most intemperate, insolent, and turbulent of all those in the democracy."
13. For whatever evil they did the state, I shall make no apology;
but as to their intimacy with Socrates, I will state how it took place.
14. These two men were by nature the most ambitious of all the Athenians, and wished that everything should be done by their means, and that they themselves should become the most celebrated of all men.
But they knew that Socrates lived with the utmost content­ ment on very small means, that he was most abstinent from every kind of pleasure, and that he swayed those with whom he conversed just as he pleased by his arguments;
is.
and, seeing such to be the case, and being such characters as they have just been stated to be, whether will any one say that they sought his society from a desire to lead such a life as Socrates led, and to practise such temperance as he practised, or from an expectation that, if they associated with him, they would become eminently able to speak and act?
16. I myself, indeed, am of opinion, that if a god had given them their choice, whether they would live their whole lives as they saw Socrates living, or die, they would have chosen rather to die;
and they showed this disposition by what they did;
for as soon as they considered themselves superior to their asso­ ciates, they at once started away from Socrates, and engaged in political life, to qualify themselves for which they had sought the society of Socrates.
17.
Perhaps some one may observe on this point, that Socrates should not have taught his followers politics before he taught them self-control.
To this remark I make no reply at present;
1 but I see that all teachers make themselves examples to their pupils how far they practise what they teach, and stimulate them by precepts ;
is.
and I know that Socrates made himself an example to those who associated with turn as a man of honourable and excellent character, and that he discoursed admirably concerning virtue and other things that concern mankind.
I know, too, that those men exercised self-control as long as they conversed with Socrates, not from fear lest they should be fined or beaten by him, but from a persuasion at the time that it was best to observe such conduct.
19.
Perhaps, however, many of those who profess to be philosophers, may say that a man once just, can never become unjust, or once modest, immodest;
and that, with regard to any other qualification, (among such as can be taught,) he who has once learned it can never become ignorant of it.
But regarding such points I am not of that opinion ;
for I see that as those who do not exercise the body, cannot perform what is proper to the body, so those who do not exercise the mind, cannot perform what is proper to the mind;
for they can neither do that which they ought to do, nor refrain from that from which they ought to refrain.
20. For which reason fathers keep their sons, though they be of a virtuous disposi­ tion, from the society of bad men, in the belief that associa­ tion with the good is an exercise of virtue, but that association with the bad is the destruction of it.
One of the poets also bears testimony to this truth, who says, From good men you will learn what is good;
but if you associate with the bad, you will lose the understanding which is in yon.
1
And another, who observes, A good man is at one time good, and at another bad.
21. I also concur with them;
for I see that as people forget metrical compositions when they do not practise the repetition of them, so forgetfulness of precepts of instruction is produced in those who neglect them.
But where a person forgets moral admonitions, he forgets also what the mind felt when it had a desire for self-government;
and, when he forgets this, it is not at all wonderful that he forgets self-government also.
22. I see, too, that those who arc given up to a fondness for drinking, and those who have fallen in love, are less able to attend to what they ought to do, and to refrain from what they ought not to do;
for many, who can be frugal in their expenses before they fall in love, are, after falling in love, unable to continue so;
and, when they have exhausted their resources, they no longer abstain from means of gain from which they previously shrunk as thinking them dishonourable.
23. How is it impossible, then, that he who has once had a control over himself, may afterwards cease to maintain it, and that he who was once able to observe justice, may subsequently become unable?
To me everything honourable and good seems to be maintained by exercise, and self-control not the least;
for sensual desires, generated in the same body with the soul, are constantly exciting it to abandon self-control, and to gratify themselves and the body as soon as possible.
24. Critias and Alcibiades, then, as long as they associated with Socrates, were able, with the assistance of his example, to maintain a mastery over their immoral inclinations;
but, when they were separated from him, Critias, fleeing to Thes­ saly, formed connexions there with men who practised dis­ honesty rather than justice ;
and Aleibiades also, being sought by many women, even of high rank, for his beauty, and being corrupted by many men, who were well able to seduce him by their flattery, on account of his influence in the city and among the allies, and being also honoured by the people, and easily obtaining the pre-eminence among them, became like the wrestlers in the gymnastie games, who, when they are fairly superior to others, neglect their exercise ;
so he grew neglectful of self-control.
25. When such was their for­ tune, and when they were proud of their birth, elated with their wealth, puffed up with their power, corrupted by many associates, demoralized by all these means, and long absent from Socrates, what wonder is it if they became headstrong ?
26.
And then, if they did anything wrong, does the accuser blame Socrates for it?
and does Socrates seem to the accuser deserving of no praise, for having, when they were young, and when it is likely that they were most inconsiderate and in­ tractable, rendered them discreet?
27. Yet other affairs are not judged of in such a way;
for what flute-player, or what teacher of the harp, or what other instructor, if he produces competent pupils, and if they, attaching themselves to other masters, become less skilful, is blamed for their deterioration ?
Or what father, if his son, while he associated with one man, should be virtuous, but afterwards, on uniting himself to some other person, should become vicious, would blame the former of the two ?
would he not rather, the more corrupt his son became with the second, bestow the greater praise on the first ?
Not even parents themselves, when they have their sons in their society, are blamed if their sons do anything wrong, provided they themselves are correct in their conduct.
28. In the same manner it would be right to judge of Socrates ;
if he had done anything immoral, he would justly be thought to be a bad man ;
but if he constantly observed morality, how can he reasonably bear the blame of vice which was not in him ?an.
Or even if be himself did nothing wrong, but com­ mended others when he saw them doing wrong, he would justly be censured.
When he perceived, however, that Critias was enamoured of Euthydemus, and was seeking to have the enjoyment of his society, like those who abuse the persons of others for licentious purposes, he dissuaded him from his in­ tention, by saying that it was illiberal, and unbecoming a man of honour and proper feeling, to offer supplications to the ob­ ject of his affections, with whom he wished to be held in high esteem, beseeching and entreating him, like a beggar, to grant a favour, especially when such favour was for no good end.
30. But as Critias paid no regard to such remonstrances, and was not diverted from his pursuit, it is said that Socrates, in the presence of many others as well as of Euthydemus, observed that " Critias seemed to him to have some feeling like that of a pig, as he wished to rub against Euthydemus as swine against stones."
31. Critias, in consequence, conceived such a hatred to Socrates, that when he was one of the Thirty Tyrants, and was appointed a law-maker1 with Charicles, he remembered the circumstance to his disadvantage, and insert­ ed in his laws that " none should teach the art of disputa­ tion," intending an insult to Socrates, yet not knowing how to affect him in particular, but laying to his charge what was imputed to the philosophers by the multitude,2 and calumni­ ating him to the people;
at least such is my opinion;
for I myself never heard this from Socrates, nor do 1 remember having known any one say that he heard it from him.
32. But Critias showed that such was the case;
for when the Thirty had put to death many of the citizens, and those not of the inferior class, and had encouraged many to acts of injus­ tice,1 Socrates happened to observe, that “it seemed surprising to him if a man, becoming herdsman of a number of cattle, and rendering the cattle fewer and in worse condition, should not confess that lie was a bad herdsman, and still more surprising if a man, becoming governor of a city, and rendering the peo­ ple fewer and in worse condition, should not feel ashamed, and be conscious of being a bad governor of the city."
33. This remark being repeated to the Thirty, Critias and Charicles summoned Socrates before them, showed him the law, and forbade him to hold discourse with the youth.
Socrates in­ quired of them, if he might be permitted to ask a question as to any point in the prohibitions that might not be understood by him.
They gave him permission.
34. “Then," said he, “I am prepared to obey the laws;
but that I may not unconsciously transgress through ignorance, I wish to ascertain exactly from you, 'whether it is because you think that the art of reasoning is an auxiliary to what is rightly spoken,2 or to what is not rightly spoken, that you give command to abstain from it;
for if it be an adjunct to what is rightly spoken, it is plain that we have to abstain from speaking rightly ;
but if to what is not rightly spoken, it is plain that we ought to en­ deavour to speak rightly.’”
33. Charicles, falling into a passion with him, said, " Since, Socrates, you are ignorant of this particular, we give you an order more easy to be under­ stood, not to discourse at all with the young." " That it may not be doubtful, then," said Socrates, “whether I do anything contrary to what is enjoined, define for me till what age I must consider men to be young." " As long," replied Chari­ cles, "as they are not allowed to fill the office of senator, as not being yet come to maturity of understanding ;
and do not discourse with such as are under thirty years of age."
36. "And if I wish to buy anything," said Socrates, " and a. person under thirty years of age has it for sale, may I not ask him at what price he sells it?" " Yes, such questions as these," replied Charicles, " but you are accustomed to ask most of your ques­ tions about things, when you know very well how they stand ;
such questions, therefore, do not ask." " If then any young man," said he, "should ask me such a question as 'where docs Charicles live?' or where is Critias?' may I not answer him, if I know?"
"Yes, you may answer such questions," said Charicles.
37. " But," added Critias, "it will be necessary for you to abstain from speaking of those shoemakers, 1 and carpenters, and smiths;
indeed I think that they must now be worn out, from being so often in your mouth." " I must therefore," said Socrates, "abstain from the illustrations that I attach to the mention of those people, illustrations on jus­ tice, piety, and other such subjects."
"Yes, by Jupiter," retorted Charicles", " and you must abstain from illustrations taken from herdsmen;
for, if you do not, take care lest you yourself make the cattle fewer."
2 38. Hence it was evident that they were angry with Socrates on account of his remark about the cattle having been reported to them.
What sort of intercourse Critias had with Socrates, and how they stood towards each other, has now been stated.
39. But I would say that no regular training is derived by any one from a teacher who does not please him ;
and Critias and Alcibiades did not associate with Socrates, while their associ­ ation with him lasted, as being an instructor that pleased them, but they were, from the very first, eager to be at the head of the state, for, while they still attended Socrates, they sought to converse with none more than with those who were most engaged in affairs of government.
40. Alcibiades, it is said, before he was twenty years of age, held the following dis­ course with Pericles, who was his guardian, and chief ruler of the state, about laws.
41. " Tell me," said he, "Pericles, can you teach me what a law is." " Certainly," replied Peri clef!. "
Teach me then, in the name of the gods," said Alcibiades, " for I, hearing some persons praised as being obedient to the laws, consider that no one can fairly obtain such praise who does not know what a law is."
42. " You desire no very difficult matter, Alcibiades," said Pericles, "when you wish to know what a law is;
for all those regulations are laws, which the people, on meeting together and approving them, have enacted, directing what we should do and what we should not do." "
And whether do they direct that we should do good things, or that we should do bad things ?" " Good, by Jupiter, my child," said he, "but bad by no means." 43. "And if it should not be the whole people, but a few, as where there is an oligarchy, that should meet together, and enact what we are to do, what arc such enactments ?" " Everything," replied Pericles, " which the supreme power in the state, on determin­ ing what the people ought to do, has enacted, is called a law." "
And if a tyrant, holding rule over the state, prescribes to the citizens what they must do, is such prescription called a law." " Whatever a tyrant in authority prescribes," returned Pericles, "is also called a law." 44. " What then, Pericles," asked Alcibiades, " is force and lawlessness ?
Is it not when the stronger obliges the weaker, not by persuasion, but by compulsion, to do what he pleases ? " "
So it appears to me," replied Pericles. "
Whatever then a tyrant compels the people to do, by enacting it without gaining their consent, is that an act of lawlessness ? " " Yes," said Pericles, " it appears to me that it is, for I retraet my admission 1 that what a tyrant prescribes to the people wIthout persuading them, is a law."
10. " But what the few enact, not from gaining the consent of the many, but from having superior power, should we say that that is force, or that it is not ?"
"Everything," said Peri­ cles, " which one man obliges another to do without gaining his consent, whether he enact it in writing or not, seems to me to be force rather than law." " Whatever, then, the whole people, when they are stronger than the wealthier class, enact without their consent, would be an act of force rather than a law?"
46. Certainly, Alcibiades," said Pericles ;
" and I, when I was of your age, was very acute at such disquisitions ;
for we used to meditate and argue about such subjects as you now appear to meditate." " Would therefore," said Alci­ biades, " that I had conversed with you, Pericles, at the time when you were most acute in discussing such topics ! " 47. When Alcibiades and Critias, therefore, began to think them­ selves superior to those who were then governing the state, they 110 longer attended Socrates, (for he was not agreeable to them in other respects, and they were offended, if they went to him at all, at being reproved for any error that they had committed,) but devoted themselves to political employ­ ments, with a view to which they had at first associated with Socrates.
48. But Crito was also an attendant on Socrates, as well as Chærephon, Chærecrates, Hermocrates, Simmias, Cebes, and Phædondes, who, with others that attended him, did not seek his society that they might be fitted for popular orators or forensic pleaders, but that, becoming honourable and good men, they might conduct themselves irreproachably towards their families, connexions, dependants, and friends, as well as towards their country and their fellow-citizens ;
and no one of all these, whether in youth or at a more advanced age, either was guilty, or was accused, of any crime.49. , ut Socrates," said the accuser, "taught children to show contempt for1 their parents, persuading his followers that lie rendered them wiser than their fathers, and observing that a son was allowed by the law to confine his father on convicting him of being deranged, using that circumstance as an argu­ ment that it was lawful for the more ignorant to be confined by the wiser."
50. But what Socrates said was, that he thought'he who confined another for ignorance, might justly be himself confined by those who knew what he did not know;
and, with a view to such cases, lie used to consider in what respect ignorance differed from madness, and expressed his opinion that madmen might be confined with advantage to themselves and their friends, but that those who did not know what they ought to know, might reasonably learn from those who did know.
51. "But Socrates," proceeded the accuser, "not only caused parents, but other relations, to be held in contempt by his followers, saying that relatives, as relatives, were of no profit to people who were sick, or to people going to law, but that physicians aided the one, and lawyers the other."
52. The accuser asserted, too, that Socrates said concerning friends that " it was of no profit that they were well-disposed, unless they were able also to assist;
and that he insisted that those only were deserving of honour who knew what was for the advantage of others and could make it intelligible to them;
and that by thus persuading the young that he himself was the wisest of mankind, and most capable of making others wise, he so disposed his pupils towards him, that other people were of no account with them in comparison with himself."
53. I am aware, indeed, that he did express himself concern­ ing parents and other relatives, and concerning friends, in such a manner as this;
and used to say, besides, that when the soul has departed, in which alone intelligence exists, men take away the body of their dearest friend, and put it out of sight as soon as possible.
54. He was accustomed to say, also, that every man, while lie is alive, removes of himself from his own body, which he loves most of all things, and allows others to remove from it, everything that is useless and un­ profitable ;
since men themselves take off portions of their nails, and hair, and callous parts, and resign themselves to surgeons to cut and burn them with labour and pain, and think it their duty even to pay them money for their operations;
and the saliva from the mouth, he said, men spit away as far as pos­ sible, because, while it is in the mouth, it profits them nothing, but is far more likely to harm them.
55. But such observa­ tions Socrates uttered, not to teach any one of his followers to bury his father alive, or to cut himself to pieces, but, by showing that what is senseless is worthless, he exhorted each to study to become as intelligent and useful as possible, so that, whether he wished to be honoured by his father, by his brother, or by any one else, he might not be neglectful of himself through trusting to his relationship, but might endea­ vour to be serviceable to those by whom lie desired to be respected.
56.
The accuser also said that Socrates, selecting the worst passages of the most celebrated poets, and using them as arguments, taught those who kept him company to be un­ principled and tyrannical.
The verse of Hesiod, for example, Work is no disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace,1 they say that lie used to explain as intimating that the poet bids us abstain from no kind of work, dishonest or dishonour­ able, but to do such work for the sake of profit.
57. But when Socrates maintained that to be busy was useful and beneficial for a man, and that to be unemployed was noxious and ill for him, that to work was a good, and to be idle an evil, he at the same time observed that those only who do something good really work, and are useful workmen,2 but those who gamble, or do anything bad and pernicious, he called idle;
and in this view the sentiment of the poet will bo unobjectionable, Work is no disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace.
58. That passage of Homer, too, the accuser stated that he often used to quote, in which it is said that Ulysses, Whatever king or eminent hero he found, Stood beside him, and detained him with gentle words.
"
Illustrious chief, it is not fit that you should shrink back as a coward;
Sit down yourself, and make the rest of the people sit down."
But whatever man of the people he noticed, and found clamouring, He struck him with his staff, and rebuked him with words:
" Worthless fellow, sit down in peace, and hear the exhortations of others, Who are much better than you ;
for you are unwarlike and power­ less, Neither to be numbered in the field nor in the council."
1 so.
And he said that he used to explain it as if the poet re­ commended that plebeians and poor people should be beaten.
Socrates, however, said no such thing, (for he would thus have given an opinion that he himself ought to be beaten,) but what he did say was, that those who benefited others neither by word nor deed, and who were incapable of serving the army, or the state, or the common people, if they should ever be called upon to serve, should, especially if, in addition to their incapacity, they were of an insolent spirit, be curbed in every way, even though they might be ever so rich.
CHI.
But, contrary to the charge of the accuser, Socrates was evidently a friend to the common people, and of a liberal dis­ position;
for though he received numbers of persons desirous to hear him discourse, as well citizens as foreigners, he never required payment for his communications from any one, but imparted to every one in abundance from his stores, of which some2 receiving fragments from him for nothing, sold them at a great price to others, and were not, like him, friends to the common people, for they declined to converse with such as had not money to give them.
61. But Socrates, in the eyes of other men, conferred glory on the city, far more than Liehas, who was celebrated in this respect, on that of the Lacedæ­ monians ;
for Lichas indeed entertained the strangers that visited Lacedæmon at the Gymnopædiæ,3 but Socrates, through the whole course of his life, freely imparted whatever he had to bestow, and thus benefited in the highest degree all who were willing to receive from him, making those who asso­ ciated with him better before he let them go.
62.
To me, therefore, Socrates, being a man of such a character, appeared to be worthy of honour rather than of death;
and any one, considering his case according to the laws, would find such to be the fact;
for, by the laws, death is the punishment for a man if he be found stealing, or strip­ ping people of their clothes, or cutting purses, or house- breaking, or kidnapping, or sacrilege, of which crimes So­ crates was the most innocent of all men.
63. Nor was he ever the cause of any war ending unfortunately for the state, or of any sedition or treachery ;
nor did he ever, in his private transactions, either deprive any man of what was for his good, or involve him in evil;
nor did he ever lie under suspicior of any of the crimes which I have mentioned.
64. How then could he have been guilty of the charges brought against him ?
a man who, instead of not acknowledg­ ing the gods, as was stated in the indictment, evidently paid respect to the gods more than other men ;
and instead of cor­ rupting the youth, as the accuser laid to his charge, plainly led such of his associates as had vicious inclinations, to cease from indulging them, and exhorted them to cherish a love of that most honourable and excellent virtue, by which men successfully govern states and families.
How then, pursuing such a course of conduct, was he not deserving of great honour from the city ?
Confirmation of the character of Socrates given in the preceding chapters.
He worshipped the gods, and exhorted others to worship them, sect.
1. His notions how the gods were to be supplicated, 2. His judgment as to what was acceptable to them in a sacrifice, 3. His regard for omens, 4. His observance of temperance, and recommendation of it to others, 5—151.
BUT to show how lie appeared to improve those whc associated with him, partly by showing them what his character was, and partly by his conversation, I shall record whatever I can remember of him relating to these points.
As to what had reference to the gods, then, he evidently acted and spoke in conformity with the answer which the priestess of Apollo gives to those who inquire how they ought to proceed with regard to a sacrifice, to the worship of their uncestors, or to any such matter ;
for the priestess replies that they will act piously, if they act in agreement with the laMo of their country, and Socrates both acted in this manner him­ self, and exhorted others to act similarly;
and such as acted in any other way he regarded as doing what was not to the purpose, 1 and guilty of folly.
2.
To the gods lie simply prayed that they would give him good things, as believing that the gods knew best what things are good;
and those who prayed for gold, or silver, or dominion, or anything of that kind, he considered to utter no other sort of requests than if they were to pray that they might play at dice, or fight, or do anything else of which it is quite uncertain what the result will be.3.
When lie offered small sacrifices from his small means, he thought that he was not at all inferior in merit to those who offered numerous and great sacrifices from ample and abundant means;
for lie said that it would not become the gods to delight in large rather than in small sacrifices;
since, if such were the case, the offerings of the bad would often­ times be more acceptable to them than those of the good ;
nor would life be of any account in the eyes of men, if oblations from the bad were better received by the gods than oblations from the good;
but he thought that the gods had most plea­ sure in the offerings of the most pious.
lie also used to quote, with approbation, the verse, Perform sacrifices to the gods according to your ability, and used to say that it was a good exhortation to men, with regard to friends, and guests, and all other relations of life, to perform according to their ability.
4.
If anything appeared to be intimated to him from the gods, be could no more have been persuaded to act contrary to such intimation, than any one could have persuaded him to take for his guide on a journey a blind man, or one who did not know the way, instead of one who could see, and did know it;
and he condemned the folly of others, who act con­ trary to what is signified by the gods, through anxiety to avoid the ill opinion of men.
As for himself, he undervalued everything human, in comparison with counsel from the gods.'5.
He disciplined his mind and body by such a course of life, that he who should adopt a similar one, would, if no supernatural influence prevented, live in good spirits and un­ interrupted health;
nor would he ever be in want of the necessary expenses for it.
So frugal was he, that I do not know whether any one could earn so little by the labour of his hands, as not to procure sufficient to have satisfied So­ crates.
He took only so much food as he could eat with a keen relish ;
and, to this end, he came to his meals2 so dis­ posed that the appetite for his meat was the sauce to it.
Every kind of drink was agreeable to him, because he never drank unless he was thirsty.
6. If he ever complied with an invitation to go to a feast, he very easily guarded, what is extremely difficult to most men, against loading his stomach to excess.
Those who were unable to do so, he advised to bo cautious of taking anything that would stimulate them to eat when they were not hungry, and to drink when they were not thirsty ;
for he said that those were the things that dis­ ordered the stomach, the head, and the mind ;
7.
and he used to say, In jest, that he thought Circe transformed men into swine, by entertaining them with abundance of such luxuries, but that Ulysses, through the admonition of Mercury, and through being himself temperate, and forbearing to partake of such delicacies to excess, was in consequence not changed into a. swine.
8.
Such jests lie would utter on these subjects, but with an earnest meaning.
As to love, his counsel was to abstain rigidly from familiarity with beautiful persons;
for he ob­ served that it was not easy to be in communication with such persons, and observe continence.
Hearing, on one occasion, that Critobulus, the son of Criton, had kissed the son of Alci­ biades,1 a handsome youth, he asked Xenophon, in the pre­ sence of Critobulus, saying, “ Tell me, Xenophon, did you not think that Critobulus was one of the modest rather than the forward, one of the thoughtful rather than of the thoughtless and inconsiderate?"
9. “ Certainly,” replied Xenophon.
“You must now, then, think him extremely headstrong and daring ;
one who would even spring upon drawn swords, and leap into the fire."
10. "And what," said Xenophon, "have you seen him doing, that you form so unfavourable an opinion of him ? " " Why, has he not dared," rejoined Socrates, "to kiss the son of Alcibiades, a youth extremely handsome, and in the flower of his ago ? " “ If such a deed," returned Xenophon, " is one of daring and peril, I think that even I could undergo such peril."
11. “ Unhappy man ! " exclaimed Socrates, “ and what do you think that you incur by kissing a handsome person ?
Do you not expect to become at once a slave instead of a free­ man ?
To spend much money upon hurtful pleasures ?
To have too much occupation to attend to anything honourable and profitable ?
And to be compelled to pursue what not even a madman would pursue?”
12. By Hercules," said Xenophon, "what extraordinary power you represent to bo in a kiss ! ” “
Do you wonder at this ?
” rejoined Socrates;
“ are you not aware that the Tamntula,2 an insect not as large as half an obolus, by just touching a part of the body with its mouth, wears men down with pain, and deprives them of their senses ? " " Yes, indeed," said Xenophon, “but the Tarantula infuses something at the bitten part ? " 13. “ And do you not think, foolish man," rejoined Socrates, " that beauti­ ful persons infuse something when they kiss, something which you do not see ?
Do you not know that the animal, which they call a handsome and beautiful object, is so much more formidable than the Tarantula, as those insects instil something when they touch the body, but this creature, without even touching, but if a person only looks at it, though from a very great distance, instils something of such potency, as to drive people mad ?
Perhaps indeed Cupids aloe called archers for no other reason but because the beautiful wound from a dis­ tance.
But I advise you, Xenophon, whenever you see any handsome person, to flee without looking behind you ;
and I recommend to you, Critobulus, to absent yourself from hence for a year, for perhaps you may in that time, though hardly indeed, be cured of your wound."14. Thus he thought that those should act with regard to objects of love who were not secure against the attractions of such objects;
objects of such a nature, that if the body did not at all desire them, the mind would not contemplate them, and which, if the body did desire them, should cause us no trouble.
For himself, he was evidently so disciplined with respect to such matters, that he could more easily keep aloof from the fairest and most blooming objects than others from the most deformed and unattractive.
15.
Such was the state of his feelings in regard to eating, drinking, and amorous gratification ;
and he believed that he himself, with self-restraint, would have no less pleasure from them, than those who took great trouble to pursue such grati­ fications, and that he would suffer far less anxiety.
Socrates not only exhorted men to practise virtue, but led them to the prac­ tice of it;
his dialogue with Aristodemus, sect.
1, 2. Things formed for a purpose, must be the production, not of chance, but of reason, 3, 4.
The human frame is a structure of great excellence, and admirably fitted for its purposes;
and we must therefore suppose that man is the object of divine forethought, 5—7.
The order of things throughout the universe shows that it is under the providence of a superior nature, 8,9.
The supe­ riority of man over the inferior animals proves that he is more immedi­ ately under the care of the higher powers, 10—14.
The gods also give instruction to man as to his conduct, 1,5.
That they care for man both in­ dividually and collectively is evident from various considerations, 15, 16.
As the mind governs the body, so the providence of the gods governs the world, 17.
If men therefore worship the gods rightly, they may feel persuaded that the gods will be ready to aid them, 18, 19.1.
BUT if any suppose that Socrates, as some write and speak of him on conjecture,1 was excellently qualified to ex­ hort men to virtue, but incapable of leading them forward in it, let them consider not only what he said in refutation, by questioning, of those who thought that they knew everything, (refutations intended to check the progress of those disput­ ants,)2 but what he used to say in his daily intercourse with his associates, and then form an opinion whether he was capa­ ble of making those who conversed with him better.
2. I will first mention what I myself once heard him advance in a dialogue with Aristodemus, surnamed The Little,3 concerning the gods;
for having heard that Aristodemus neither sacri­ ficed to the gods, nor prayed to them, nor attended to augu­ ries, but ridiculed those who regarded such matters, he said to him, "Tell me, Aristodemus, do you admire any men for their genius?" "I do," replied he.
"Tell us their names, then,” said Socrates.
3. "In epic poetry I most admire Homer, in dithyrambic Melanippides,1 in tragedy Sophocles, in statuary Polycletus, in painting Zeuxis."
4. " And whether do those who form images without sense and motion, or those who form animals endowed with sense and vital energy, ap­ pear to you the more worthy of admiration ? " "
Those who form animals, by Jupiter, for they are not produced by chance, but by understanding." "
And regarding things of which it is uncertain for what purpose they exist, and those evidently existing for some useful purpose, which of the two would you say were the productions of chance, and which of intelli­ gence ? " " Doubtless those which exist for some useful pur­ pose must be the productions of intelligence." a. “ Docs not he, then," proceeded Socrates, " who made men at first, ap­ pear to you to have given them, for some useful purpose, those parts by which they perceive different objects, the eyes to see what is to be seen, the ears to hear what is to be heard ?
What would be the use of smells, if no nostrils had been as­ signed us ?
What perception would there have been of sweet and sour, and of all that is pleasant to the mouth, if a tongue had not been formed in it to have a sense of them ?
6. In ad­ dition to these things, does it not seem to you like the work of forethought, to guard the eye, since it is tender, with eye­ lids, like doors, which, when it is necessary to use the sight, are set open, but in sleep are closed ?
To make the eyelashes grow as a screen, that winds may not injure it ?
To make a cop­ in,-, on the parts above the eyes with the eye-brows, that the perspiration from the head may not annoy them ?
To provide that the ears may receive all kinds of sounds, yet never be ob­ structed ?
and that the front teeth in all animals may be adapted to cut, and the back teeth to receive food from them and grind it ?
To place the mouth, through which animals take in what they desire, near the eyes and the nose?
and since what passes off from the stomach is offensive, to turn the channels of it away, and remove them as far as possible from the senses?—can you doubt whether such a disposition of things, made thus apparently with attention, is the result of chance or of intelligence ? " 7. " No, indeed," replied Aris­ todemus, “ but to one who looks at those matters in this light, they appear like the work of some wise maker who studied the welfare of animals ?”
"And to have engendered in them a love of having offspring, and in mothers a desire to rear their progeny, and to have implanted in the young that are reared a desire of life, and the greatest dread of death?” "
Assuredly these appear to be the contrivances of some one who designed that animals should continue to exist.
"8. “ And do you think that you yourself have any portion of intelligence?" " Question me, at least, and I will answer.”
1 “ And can you suppose that nothing intelligent exists any­ where else ?
When you know that you have in your body but a small portion of the earth, which is vast, and a small portion of the water, which is vast, and that your frame is constituted for you to receive only a small portion of each of other things, that are vast, do you think that you have seized for yourself, by some extraordinary good fortune, in­ telligence alone which exists nowhere else, and that this assemblage of vast bodies, countless in number, is maintained in order by something void of reason?"
9. “By Jupiter, I can hardly suppose that there is any ruling intelligence among that assemblage of bodics,2 for I do not see the directors, as I see the agents of things which are done here." “
Nor do you see your own soul, which is the director of your body;
so that, by like reasoning, you may say that you yourself do nothing with understanding, but everything by chance.
"10. "However, Socrates,” said Aristodemus, "I do not despise the gods, but consider them as too exalted to need my attention."
"But," said Socrates, "the more exalted they arc, while they deign to attend to you, the more ought you to honour them."
11. “ Be assured," replied Aristodemus, " that if I believed the gods took any thought for men, I would not neglect them." “ Do you not, then, believe that the gods take thought for men?
the gods who, in the first place, have made man alone, of all animals, upright, (which uprightness ables him to look forward to a greater distance, and to con­ template better what is above, and renders those parts less liable to injury in which1 the gods have placed the eyes, and cars, and mouth;
) and, in the next place, have given to other animals only feet, which merely give them the capacity of walking, while to men they have added hands, which execute most of those things through which we are better off than they.
12. And though all animals have tongues, they have made that of man alone of such a nature, as, by touching sometimes one part of the mouth, and sometimes another, to express articulate sounds, and to signify everything that we wish to communicate one to another.
Do you not see, too, that to other animals they have so given the pleasures of sexual in­ tercourse as to limit them to a certain season of the year, but that they allow them to us uninterruptedly till extreme old age?
13. Nor did it satisfy the gods to take care of the body merely, but, what is most important of all, they implanted in him the soul, his most excellent part.
For what other animal has a soul to understand, first of all, that the gods, who have arranged such a vast and noble order of things, exist?
What other species of animal, besides man, offers worship to the gods ?
What other animal has a mind better fitted than that of man, to guard against hunger or thirst, or cold or heat, or to relieve disease, or to acquire strength by exercise, or to labour to attain knowledge;
or more capable of remembering whatever it has heard, or seen, or learned?
14. Is it not clearly evident to you, that, in comparison with other animals, men live like gods, excelling them by nature, both in body and mind ?
For an animal, having the body of an ox, and the understanding of a man, would be unable to execute what it might meditate;
and animals which have hands,1 but are without reason, have no advantage over others ;
and do you, who share both these excellent endowments, think that the gods take no thought for you ?
What then must they 1o, before you will think that they take thought for you?”2 15. "I will think so," observed Aristodemus, "when they send me, as you say that they send to you, monitors, to show what I ought, and what I ought not, to do." “
But when they send admonitions to the Athenians, on consulting them by divination, do you not think that they admonish you also?
Or when they give warnings to the Greeks by sending por­ tents, or when they give them to the whole human race, do they except you alone from the whole, and utterly neglect you ?
16.
Do you suppose, too, that the gods would have en­ gendered a persuasion in men that they are able to benefit or injure them, unless they were really able to do so, and that men, if they had been thus perpetually deluded, would not have become sensible of the delusion?
Do you not see that the oldest and wisest of human communities, the oldest and wisest cities and nations, are the most respectful to the gods, and that the wisest age of man is the most observant of their worship?
17. Consider also, my good youth," continued Socrates, " that your mind, existing within your body, directs your body as it pleases;
and it becomes you therefore to believe that the intelligence pervading all things directs all things as may be agreeable to it, and not to think that while your eye can extend its sight over many furlongs, that of the divinity3 is unable to see all things at once, or that while your mind can think of things here, or things in AEgypt or Sicily, the mind of the deity is incapable of regarding every- thing at the same time.
is.
If, however, as you discover, by paying court to men, those who are willing to pay court to you in return, and, by doing favours to men, those who are willing to return your favours, and as, by asking counsel of men you discover who are wise, you should, in like manner, make trial of the gods by offering worship to them, whether they will advise you concerning matters hidden from man, you will then find that the divinity is of such power, and of such a nature, as to see all things and hear all things at once, to be present everywhere, and to have a care for all things at the same time.
"19.
By delivering such sentiments, Socrates seems to me to have led his associates to refrain from what was impious, or unjust, or dishonourable, not merely when they were seen by men, but when they were in solitude, since they would con­ ceive that nothing that they did would escape the knowledge of the gods.
Temperance and self-control recommended:
lie that is destitute of tem­ perance can be profitable or agreeable neither to himself nor others, sect.
1—4. Without temperance nothing can be learned or done with duo effect, 5. Socrates not only encouraged to temperance by precepts, but by his example, 6.1, IF temperance, moreover, be an honourable and valuable quality in a man, let us consider whether lie at all promoted, its observance by reflections of the following kind concern­ ing it.
"If, my friends, when a war was coming upon us, we should wish to choose a man by whose exertions we might ourselves be preserved, and might gain the mastery over our enemies, should we select one whom we knew to be unable to resist gluttony, or wine, or sensuality, or fatigue, or sleep ?
How could we think that such a man would either serve us, or conquer our adversaries ?
2. Or if, being at the close of life, we should wish to commit to any one the guardianship of our sons, or the care of our unmarried daughters, or the preservation of our property, should we think an intemperat( man worthy of confidence for such purposes?
Should we in­ trust to an intemperate slave our herds, our granaries, or the superintendence of our agriculture?
Should we be willing to accept such a slave as an agent, or purveyor, even for nothing ?
3. But if we would not even accept an intemperate slave, how can it be otherwise than important for every man to take care that he himself does not become such a character ?
For the intemperate man is not injurious to his neighbour and pro­ fitable to himself, (like the avaricious, who, by despoiling others of their property, seem to enrich themselves,) but, while he is mischievous to others, is still more mischievous to himself, for it is, indeed, mischievous in the highest degree, to ruin not only his family, but his body and mind.
4. In society, too, who could find pleasure in the company of such a man, who, lie would be aware, felt more delight in eating and drinking than in intercourse with his friends, and preferred the company of harlots to that of his fellows?
Is it not the duty of every man to consider that temperance is the founda­ tion of every virtue, and to establish the observance of it in his mind before all things ?
5. For who, without it, can either learn anything good, or sufficiently practise it ?
Who, that is a slave to pleasure, is not in an ill condition both as to his body and his mind ?
It appears to me, by Juno,1 that a free­ man ought to pray that he may never meet with a slave of such a character, and that lie who is a slave to pleasure should pray to the gods that he may find well-disposed masters;
for by such means only can a man of that sort be saved.”6. While such were the remarks that he made, he proved himself more a friend, to temperance by his life than by his words ;
for he was not only superior to all corporeal pleasures, but also to those attendant on the acquisition of money;
thinking that he who received money from any one,2 set up a master over himself, and submitted to a slavery as disgrace­ ful as any that could be.
Three dialogues of Socrates with Antipho.
I. Antipho ridicules the poverty and frugality of Socrates, and his forbearance to receive pay for his in­ structions, sect.
1—3;
Socrates replies that, by not receiving remunera­ tion, he is more at liberty to choose his audience, 4, 5 ;
that there are various advantages attendant on plainness of diet and dress, 6, 7;
that the frugal man has the advantage over the man of pleasure in facilities for self-improvement, for doing his duty to his country, and for securing general happiness, 8—10.
II.
Antipho asserts that Socrates might be a Just man, but was by no means wise, in accepting no payment, 11, 12;
Socrates replies that to sell wisdom is to degrade it, and that more good is gained by the acquisition of friends than of money, 13, 14.
III.
An­ tipho asks Socrates why, when he trained others to manage public affairs, he took no part in public affairs himself;
Socrates replies that he was of more service to his country by training many to govern it, than he could have been by giving his single aid in the government of it, 15.1.
IT is due to Socrates, also, not to omit the dialogues which he held with Antipho the sophist.
Antipho, on one occasion, wishing to draw away his associates from him, came up to Socrates, when they were present, and said, 2. " I thought, Socrates, that those who studied philosophy were tc become happier than other men ;
but you seem to have reaped from philosophy fruits of an opposite kind;
at least you live in a way in which no slave would continue to live with his master;
you eat food, and drink drink, of the worst kind;
you wear a dress, not only bad, but the same both summer and winter, and you continue shoeless and coatless.
1 3. Money, which cheers men when they receive it, and enables those who possess it to live more generously and pleasantly, you do not take;
and if, therefore, as teachers in other professions make their pupils imitate themselves, you also shall produce a similar effect on your followers, you must consider yourself but a teacher of wretchedness."
4. Socrates, in reply to these remarks, said, " You seem to me, Antipho, to have conceived a notion that I live so wretchedly, that I feel persuaded you yourself would rather choose to die than pass your life as I pass mine.
Let us then consider what it is that you find dis­ agreeable in my mode of life.
5. Is it that while others, who receive money, must perform the service for which they re­ ceive it, while I, who receive none, am under no necessity to discourse with any one that I do not like ?
Or do you despise my way of living, on the supposition that I eat less whole­ some or less strengthening food than yourself?
Or is it that my diet is more difficult to procure than yours, as being more rare and expensive ?
Or is it that what you procure for yourself is more agreeable to you than what I provide for myself is to me?
Do you not know that he who cats with the most pleasure is he who least requires sauce, and that he who drinks with the greatest pleasure is he who least desires other drink than that which he has ?
6. You know that those who change their clothes, change them because of cold and heat, and that men put on sandals that they may not be pre­ vented from walking through annoyances to the feet;
but have you ever observed me remaining at home, on account of cold, more than any other man, or fighting with any one for shade because of heat, or not walking wherever I please be­ cause my feet suffer ?
7. Do you not know that those who are by nature the weakest, become, by exercising their bodies, stronger in those things in which they exercise them, than those who neglect them, and bear the fatigue of exercise with greater ease ?
And do you not think that I, who am con­ stantly preparing my body by exercise to endure whatever may happen to it, bear everything more easily than you who take no exercise ?
8. And to prevent me from being a slave to gluttony, or sleep, or other animal gratifications, can you imagine any cause more efficient than having other objects of attention more attractive than they, which not only afford pleasure in the moment of enjoying them, but give hopes that they will benefit me perpetually ?
You are aware of this also, that those who think themselves successful in nothing, are far from being cheerful, but that those who regard their agricul­ ture, their seamanship, or whatever other occupation they pursue, as going on favourably for them, are delighted as with present success ?
9. But do you think that from all these gratifications so much pleasure can arise as from the consci­ ousness that you are growing better yourself, and are acquir­ ing more valuable friends ?
Such is the consciousness, then, which I continue to enjoy.“
But if there should be occasion to assist our friends or our country, which of the two would have most leisure to attend to such objects, he who lives as I live now, or he who lives, as you think, in happiness?
Which of the two would most readily seek the field of battle, he who cannot exist without expensive dishes, or he who is content with whatever comes before him ?
Which of the two would sooner be reduced by a siege, he who requires what is most difficult to be found, or he who is fully content with what is easiest to be met with ?
10. You, Antipho, seem to think that happiness consists in luxury and extravagance;
but I think that to want nothing is to resemble the gods, and that to want as little as possible is to make the nearest approach to the gods;
that the Divine nature is perfection, and that to be nearest to the Divine nature is to be nearest to perfection."11.
On another occasion, Antipho, in a conversation with Socrates, said, "I consider you indeed to be a just man, So­ crates, but by no means a wise one;
and you appear to me yourself to be conscious of this;
for you ask money from no one for the privilege of associating with you;
although, if you considered a garment of yours, or a house, or any other thing that you possess, to be worth money, you would not only not give it to anybody for nothing, but you would not take less than its full value for it.
12. It is evident, therefore, that if you thought your conversation to be worth anything, you would demand for it no less remuneration than it is worth.
You may, accordingly, be a just man, because you deceive nobody from covetousness, but wise you cannot be, as you have no knowledge that is of any value."
13. Socrates, in reply, said, " It is believed among us, Antipho, that it is possible to dispose of beauty, or of wisdom, alike honourably or dishonourably;
1 for if a person sells his beauty for money to any one that wishes to purchase, men call him a male pros­ titute;
but if any one makes a friend of a person whom he knows to be an honourable and worthy admirer, we regard him as prudent:
and, in like manner, those who sell their wisdom for money, to any that will buy, men call sophists, or, as it were, prostituters of wisdom ;
Iut whoever makes a friend of a person whom he knows to be deserving, by teach­ in,,,, him all the good that he knows, we consider him to act the part which becomes an honourable and good citizen.
14. As any other man, therefore, Antipho, takes delight in a good horse, or do,-, or bird, so I, to a still greater degree, take de­ light in valuable friends;
and, if I know anything good, I communicate it to them, and recommend them, also, to any other teachers by whom I conceive that they will be at all advanced in virtue.
The treasures, too, of the wise men of old, which they have left written in books, I turn over and peruse in company with my friends, and if we find anything good in them, we remark it, and think it a great gain if we thus become more attached 1 to one another."
To me, who heard him utter these sentiments, Socrates appeared to be both happy himself, and to lead those that listened to him to honour and virtue.
15.
Again, when Antipho asked him how he imagined that he could make men skilful statesmen, when he himself took no part in state affairs, if indeed he knew anything of them, "In which of the two ways," said he, "Antipho, should I better promote the management of affairs ;
if I myself engage in them alone, or if I make it my care that as many as possi­ ble may be qualified to engage in them?
"Dissuasions from ostentation.
He that desires to be distinguished, should endeavour to be what he would wish to seem.
He that pretends to be what he is not, exposes himself to great ineonvenicnce and ridicule, and may bring disgrace and detriment on his country.
I. LET us consider also, whether, by dissuading his fol­ lowers from ostentation, he excited them to pursue virtue.
He always used to say that there was no better road to honour­ able distinction, than that by which a person should become excellent in that in which he wished to appear excellent.
2.
That he said what was just, he used to prove by the fol­ lowing arguments.
"Let us consider," he would say, " what a person must do, if, not being a good flute-player, he should wish to appear so ?
Must he not imitate good flute-players in the adjuncts of their art ?
In the first place, as flute-players procure fine dresses, and go about with a great number of attendants, he must act in a similar manner;
and as many people applaud them, lie must get many to applaud him;
yet lie must never attempt to play, or he will at once be shown to be ridiculous, and not only a bad flute-player, but a vain boaster.
Thus, after having been at great expense without the least benefit, and having, in addition, incurred evil repute, how will he live otherwise than in uneasiness, unprofitable­ ness, and derision ?3.
"In like manner, if any one should wish to be thought a good general, or a good steersman of a ship, without being so, let us reflect what would be his success.
If, when he longed to seem capable of performing the duties of those characters, he should be unable to persuade others of his capability, would not this be a trouble to him?
and, if he should per­ suade them of it, would it not be still more unfortunate for him ?
For it is evident that he who is appointed to steer a vessel, or to lead an army, without having the necessary knowledge, would be likely to destroy those 1 whom he would not wish to destroy, and would come off himself with disgrace and suffering."4. By similar examples he showed that it was of no profit for a man to appear rich, or valiant, or strong, without being so;
for lie said that demands were made upon such persons too great for their ability, and that, not being able to comply with them, when they seemed to be able, they met with no indulgence.
5.
He called him, also, no small impostor, who, obtaining money or furniture from his neighbour by persuasion, should defraud him ;
but pronounced him the greatest of all impostors, who, possessed of no valuable qualifications, should deceive men by representing himself capable of governing his country.
To me he appeared, by discoursing in this manner, to deter his associates from vain boasting.
Socrates, suspecting that Aristippus, a man of pleasure, was aspiring to a place in the government, admonishes him that temperance is an essential qualification in a statesman, sect.
1—7. But as Aristippus says that ho looked only to a life of leisure and tranquil enjoyment, Socrates intro­ duces the question, whether those who govern, or those who are governed, live the happier life, 8—10.
Aristippus signifies that he wished neither to govern nor to be governed, but to enjoy liberty;
and Socrates shows that such liberty as he desired is inconsistent with the nature of human society, 11—13.
Aristippus still adhering to his own views, and declaring his intention not to remain in any one country, but to visit and sojourn in many, Socrates shows him the dangers of such a mode of life, 14—16.
But as Aristippus proceeds to aceuse those of folly who prefer a life of toil in the affairs of government to a life of case, Socrates shows the difference between those who labour voluntarily, and those whe labour from compulsion, and observes that nothing good is given to mor­ tals without labour, 17—20;
in illustration of which remark he relates the fable of Prodicus, THE CHOICE OF HERCULES, 21—31.I.
HE appeared also to me, by such discourses as the fol­ lowing, to exhort his hearers to practise temperance in their desires for food, drink, sensual gratification, and sleep, and endurance of cold, heat, and labour.'
But finding that one of his associates was too intemperately disposed with regard to such matters, he said to him, " Tell me, Aristippus, I if it were required of you to take two of our youths and educate them, the one in such a manner that he would be qualified to govern, and the other in such a manner that he would never seek to govern, how would you train them respectively?
Will you allow us to consider the matter by commencing with their food, as with the first principles?"
"Food, indeed," re­ plied Aristippus, "appears to me one of the first principles ;
for a person could not even live if he were not to take food."
2. "It will be natural for them both, then," said Socrates, "to desire to partake of food when a certain hour comes." "
It will be natural," said Aristippus.
"And which of the two, then," said Socrates, "should we accustom to prefer the discharge of any urgent business to the gratification of his appetite?" "
Tile one undoubtedly," rejoined Aristippus, " who is trained to rule, that the business of the state may not be neglected during his administration." " And on the same person," continued Socrates, " we must, when they desire to drink, impose the duty of being able to endure thirst?"
"Assuredly," replied Aristippus.
3. And on which of the two should we by the necessity of being tem­ perate in sleep, so as to be able to go to rest late, to rise early, or to remain awake if it should be necessary?"
"Upon the same, doubtless."
"And on which of the two should we im­ pose the obligation to control his sensual appetites, that he may not be hindered by their influence from discharging whatever duty may be required of him ?" " Upon the same."
"And on which of the two should we enjoin the duty of not shrinking from labour, but willingly submitting to it?"
"This also is to be enjoined on him who is trained to rule."
"And to which of the two would it more properly belong to acquire whatever knowledge would assist him to secure the mastery over his rivals?"
"Far more, doubtless, to him who is trained to govern, for without such sort of acquirements there would be no profit in any of his other qualifications."
4. "A man, then, who is thus instructed, would appear to you less liable to be surprised by his enemies than other animals, of which some, we know, are caught by their greediness;
and others, though very shy, are yet attracted to the bait by their desire to swallow it, and consequently taken;
while others also are entrapped by drink." " Indisputably," replied Aris­ tippus.
"Are not others, too, caught through.
Their salacious­ ness, as quails and partridges, which, being attracted to the call of the female by desire and hope of enjoyment, and losing all consideration of danger, fall into traps?"
To this Aris­ tippus expressed his assent.
5. " Docs it not then," proceeded Socrates, "appear to you shameful for a man to yield to the same influence as the most senseless of animals;
as adulterers, for instance, knowing that the adulterer is in danger of suffer­ in.- what the law threatens, and of being watched, and dis­ graced if caught, yet enter into closets ;
and, though there are such dangers and dishonours hanging over the intriguer, and so many occupations that will free him from the desire of sensual gratification, does it not seem to you the part of one tormented with an evil genius, to run, nevertheless, into im­ minent.
peril?"
"It does seem so to me." said Aristippus.
6. " And since the greater part of the most necessary employ­ ments of life, such as those of war and agriculture, and not a few others, arc to be carried on in the open air, does it not appear to you to show great negligence, that, the majority of mankind should be wholly unexercised to bear cold and heat ?
"
Aristippus replied in the affirmative.
"Does it not then appear to you that we ought to train him who is intended to rule, to bear these inconveniences also without, difficulty?" " Doubtless," answered Aristippus.
7. " If, therefore, we class those capable of enduring these things among those who are qualified to govern, shall we not class such as are incapable of enduring them among those who will not even aspire to govern ?"
Aristippus expressed his assent. "
In conclusion, then, since you know the position of each of these classes of men, have you ever considered in which of them you can reasonably place yourself?"
s. "I have indeed," said Aris­ tippus, "and I by no means place myself in the class of those desiring to rule ;
for it appears to me that, when it is a task of great difficulty to procure necessaries for one's self, it is the mark of a very foolish man not to be satisfied with that occupation,1 but to add to it the labour of procuring for his fellow-countrymen whatever they need.
And is it not the greatest folly in him, that while many things which he desires are out of his reach, he should, by setting himself at the head of the state, subject himself, if he does not accomplish all that the people desire, to be punished for his failure?
9. For the people think it right to use their governors as I use my slaves ;
for I require my slaves to supply me with the neces­ saries of life in abundance, but to take no part of them them­ selves ;
and the people think it the duty of their governors to supply them with as many enjoyments as possible, but themselves to abstain from all of them.
Those, therefore, who wish to have much trouble themselves, and to give trouble to others, I I would train in this manner, and rank among those qualified to govern ;
but myself I would number with those who wish to pass their lives in the greatest pos­ sible ease and pleasure."10.
Socrates then said, " Will you allow us to consider this point also, whether the governors or the governed live with the greater pleasure?" " By all means," said Aristippus. "
In the first place, then, of the nations of which we have any knowledge, the Persians bear rule in Asia, and the Syrians, Phrygians, and Lydians are under subjection ;
the Seythians govern in Europe, and the Medians2are held in subjection;
the Carthaginians rule in Africa, and the Libyans are under subjection.
Which of these do you regard as living with the greater pleasure?
Or among the Greeks, of whom you your­ self arc, which of the two appear to you to live more happily, those who rule, or those who are in subjection ?"
11. "Yet, on the other hand,"3 said Aristippus, "I do not consign myself to slavery;
but there appears to me to be a certain middle path between the two, in which I endeavour to pro- ceed, and which leads, not through slavery, but through liberty, a path that most surely conducts to happiness."
12. “ If this path of yours, indeed," said Socrates, “ as it lies neither through sovereignty nor servitude, did not also lie through human society, what you say would perhaps be worth consideration ;
but if, while living among mankind, you shall neither think proper to rule nor to be ruled, and shall not will­ ingly pay respect to those in power, I think that you will see that the stronger know how to treat the weaker as slaves, mak­ ing them to lament both publicly and privately.
13. Do those escape your knowledge who fell and destroy the corn and trees of others that have sown and planted them, and who assail in every way such as are inferior to them, and are unwilling to flat­ ter them, until they prevail on them to prefer slavery to carrying on war against their superiors?
In private life, too, do you not see that the spirited and strong enslave the timor­ ous and weak, and enjoy the fruits of their labours?" " But for my part," answered Aristippus, “ in order that I may not suffer such treatment, I shall not shut myself up in any one state, but shall be a traveller everywhere.”
14. “ Doubtless," rejoined Socrates, " this is an admirable plan that you pro­ pose;
for since Sinnis, and Sciron, and Procrustes1 were killed, nobody injures travelers.
Yet those who manage the government in their several countries, even now make laws, in order that they may not be injured, and attach to themselves, in addition to such as are called their necessary connexions, other supporters;
they also surround their cities with ramparts, and procure weapons with which they may repel aggressors, securing, besides all these means of defence, other allies from abroad ;
and yet those who have provided themselves with all these bulwarks, nevertheless suffer injury ;
13.
and do you, having no protection of the sort, spending a long time on roads on which a very great number are out­ raged, weaker than all the inhabitants of whatever city you may arrive at, and being such a character2 as those who are eager to commit violence most readily attack, think, never­ theless, that you will not be wronged because you are a stranger?
Or are you without fear, because these cities pro­ claim safety to any one arriving or departing?
Or because you think that you would prove a slave of such a character as would profit no master, for who, you perhaps ask yourself, would wish to keep in his house a man not at all disposed to labour, and delighting in the most expensive fare?
in.
But let us consider how masters treat slaves of such a sort.
Do they not tame down their fondness for dainties by hunger?
Do they not hinder them from stealing by excluding them from every place from whence they may take anything?
Do they not prevent them from running away by putting fetters on them?
Do they not overcome their laziness by stripes?
Or how do you yourself act, when you find any one of your slaves to be of such a disposition?”
17. “ I chastise him,” said Aristippus, “ with every kind of punishment, until I compel him to serve me ?
But how do those, Socrates, who are trained to the art of ruling, which yon seem to me to con­ sider as happiness, differ from those who undergo hardships from necessity, since they will have (though it be with their own consent) to endure hunger, and thirst, and cold, and want of sleep, and suffer all other inconveniences of the same kind ?
18.
For I, for lilY own part, do not know what differ­ ence it makes to a man who is scourged on the same skin, whether it be voluntarily or involuntarily, or, in short, to one who suffers with the same body in all such points, whether lie suffer with his consent or against it, except that folly is to be attributed to him who endures troubles voluntarily.” “ What then, Aristippus,” said Socrates, “do not voluntary endur­ ances of this kind seem to you to differ from the involuntary, inasmuch as he who is hungry from choice may eat when he pleases, and he who is thirsty from choice may drink when he pleases, the same being the case with regard to other voluntary sufferings, while he who endures such hardships from necessity has no liberty to relieve himself from them when he wishes ?
Besides, lie who undergoes trouble will­ ingly, is cheered in undergoing it with some expectation of good, as the hunters of wild animals bear fatigue with plea­ sure in the.
hope of capturing them.
19. And such rewards of toil are indeed but of small worth ;
but as for those who toil that they may acquire valuable friends, or that they may subdue their enemies, or they may, by becoming vigorous in body and mind, manage their own household judiciously, and be of service to their friends and of advantage to their coun­ try, how can you think that they labour for such objects otherwise than cheerfully, or that they do not live in happi­ ness, esteeming themselves, and being praised and envied by others?
20. But indolence, moreover, and pleasures enjoyed at the moment of desire,1 are neither capable of producing a good constitution of body, as the teachers of gymnastic exer­ cises say, nor do they bring to the mind any knowledge wor­ thy of consideration ;
2 but exercises pursued with persevering labour lead men to the attainment of honourable and valuable objects, as worthy men inform us;
and Hesiod somewhere says, Vice it is possible to find in abundance and with ease;
for the way to it in smooth, and lies very near.
But before the temple of Virtue the immortal gods have placed labour, and the way to it is long and steep, and at the commencement rough;
but when the traveller has arrived at the summit, it then becomes easy, however difficult it was at first.
A sentiment to which Epicharmus gives his testimony in this verse, The gods for labour sell us all good things;
and in another place he says, O wretched mortal, desire not what is soft, lest you find what is hard 21.
Prodicus the sophist, 1 also, in his narrative concerning Her­ eules,2 which indeed he declaims to most people as a specimen of his ability, expresses a similar notion respecting virtue, speaking, as far as I remember, to the following effect:
For he says that Hercules, when he was advancing from boyhood to manhood, a period at which the young, becoming their own masters, begin to give intimations whether they will enter on life by the path of virtue or that of vice, went forth into a solitary place, and sat down, perplexed as to which of these two paths lie should pursue ;
22.
and that two female figures, of lofty stature, seemed to advance towards him, the one of an engaging and graceful mien, gifted by nature with elegance of form, modesty of look, and sobriety of demeanour,3 and clad in a white robe ;
the other fed to plumpness and softness, but assisted by art both in her complexion, so as to seem fairer and rosier than she really was, and in her gesture, so as to seem taller than her natural height;
she had her eyes wide open,4 and a robe through which her beauty would readily show itself;
she frequently contemplated her figure, and looked about to see if any one else was observing her;
and she frequently glanced back at her own shadow.
23. As they approachednearer to Hercules, slip, whom I first de­ scribed, came forward at the same pace, but the other, eager to get before her, ran up to Hercules, and exclaimed, "I see that you are hesitating, Hercules, by what path you shall enter upon life ;
if, then, you make a friend of me, I will conduct you by the most delightful and easy road, and you shall taste of every species of pleasure, and lead a life free from every sort of trouble.
24. In the first place, you shall take no thought of wars or state affairs, but shall pass your time considering what meat or drink yon may find to gratify your appetite, what you may delight yourself by seeing or hearing, what you may be pleased with smelling or touching, with what objects of affection you may have most pleasure in associating, how you may sleep most softly, and how you may secure all these enjoyments with the least degree of trouble.
25. If an apprehension of want of means, by which such de­ lights may be obtained, should ever arise in you, there is no fear that I shall urge you to procure them by toil or suffering either of body or mind ;
but you shall enjoy what others ac­ quire by labour, abstaining from nothing by which it may be possible to profit, for I give my followers liberty to benefit themselves from any source whatever."26.
Hercules, on hearing this address, said, " And what, 0 woman, is your name ?" "My friends," she replied, "call me Happiness, but those who hate me, give me, to my disparage­ ment, the name of Vice."27.
In the mean time the other female approached, and said, "I also am come to address you, Hercules, because I know your parents, and have observed your disposition in the training of your childhood, from which I entertain hopes, that if you direct your steps along the path that leads to my dwelling, you will become an excellent performer of whatever is honourable and noble, and that I shall appear more honour­ able and attractive through your illustrious deeds.
I will not deceive you, however, with promises of pleasure, but will set before you things as they really are, and as the gods have ap­ pointed them ;
as.
for of what is valuable and excellent, the gods grant nothing to mankind without labour and care;
and if you wish the gods, therefore, to be propitious to you, you must worship the gods;
if you seek to be heloved by your friends, you must serve your friends;
if you desire to be honoured by any city, you must benefit that city ;
if you long to be admired by all Greece for your merit, you must endea­ vour to be of advantage to all Greece;
if you are anxious that the earth should yield you abundance of fruit, you must cultivate the earth ;
if you think that yon should enrich your­ self from herds of cattle, you must bestow care upon herds of cattle ;
if you are eager to increase your means by war, and to secure freedom to your friends and subdue your enemies, you must learn the arts of war, and learn them from such as understand them, and practise how to use.
them with ad­ vantage;
or if yon wish to be vigorous in body, you must accustom your body to obey your mind, and exercise it with toil and exertion."29. Here Vice, interrupting her speech, said, (as Prodicus relates,) "
Do you see, Hercules, by how difficult and tedious a road this woman conducts you to gratification, while I shall lead you, by an easy and short path, to perfect happiness?
"30. " Wretched being," rejoined Virtue, " of what good are you in possession ?
Or what real pleasure do you experience, when you are unwilling to do anything for the attainment of it ?
You, who do not even wait for the natural desire of gratification, but fill yourself with all manner of dainties be­ fore you have an appetite for them, eating before you are hungry, drinking before you are thirsty, procuring cooks that you may eat with pleasure, buying costly wines that you may drink with pleasure, and running about seeking for snow) in summer;
while, in order to sleep with pleasure, you prepare not only soft beds,'2 but couches, and rockers under your couches, for you do not desire sleep in consequence of labour, but in consequence of having nothing to do;
you force the sensual inclinations before they require gratification, using every species of contrivance for the purpose, and abusing male and female ;
for thus it is that you treat your friends, insulting their modesty at night, and making them sleep away the most useful part of their day.
31. Though you are one of the immortals, yon are cast out from the society of the gods, and despised by the good among mankind ;
the sweetest of all sounds, the praises of yourself,1 you have never heard, nor have you ever seen the most pleasing of all sights, for you have never beheld one meritorious work of your own hand.
Who would believe you when you give your word for any­ thing?
Or who would assist you when in need of anything?
Or who, that has proper feeling, would venture to join your company of revellers?
for while they are young they grow impotent in body, and when they are older they are impot­ ent in mind ;
they live without labour, and in fatness, through their youth, and pass laboriously, and in wretched­ ness, through old age;
ashamed of what they have done, op­ pressed with what they have to do, having run through their pleasures in early years, and laid up afflictions for the close of life.
32. But I am the companion of the gods;
I associate with virtuous men ;
no honourable deed, divine or human, is dune without me ;
I am honoured, most of all, by the deities, and by those among men to whom it belongs to honour me, being a welcome co-operator with artisans, a faithful house­ hold guardian to masters, a benevolent assistant to servants, a benign promoter of the labours of peace, a constant auxiliary to the efforts of war.
an excellent sharer in friendship.
33. My friends have a sweet and untroubled enjoyment of meat and drink, for they refrain from them till they feel an appe­ tite.
They have also sweeter sleep than the idle ;
and are neither annoyed if they lose a portion of it, nor neglect to do their duties for the sake of it.
The young are pleased with praises from the old ;
the old are delighted with honours from the young.
They remember their former acts with pleasure, and rejoice to perform their present occupations with success;
being, through my influence, dear to the gods, beloved by their friends, and honoured by their country.
And when the destined end of life comes, they do not lie in oblivion and dis­ honour, but, celebrated with songs of praise, flourish forever in the memory of mankind.
By such a course of conduct, 0 Hercules, son of noble parents, you may secure the most ex­ alted happiness."34. Nearly thus it was that Prodicus related the instruction of Hercules by Virtue ;
adorning the sentiments, however, with far more magnificent language than that in which I now give them.
It becomes you, therefore, Aristippus, reflecting on these admonitions, to endeavour to think of what concerus the future period of your life.
A dialogue between Socrates and his son Lamprocles, who had expressed resentment against his mother.
on the duty of children to their parents.
The ungrateful are to be deemed unjust, stet.
1, 2.
The greater benefits a person has received, the more unjust is he if he is ungrateful;
and there are no greater benefits than those which children experience from their parents, 3—6.
Hence it follows that a son ought to reverence his mother, though she be severe, when he knows that her severity proceeds from kind motives, 7—12.
How great a crime the neglect of filial duty is, ap­ pears from the fact that it is punished by the laws and execrated by mail­ kind, 13, 14.
I.
HAVING learned, one day, that Lamprocles, the eldest1 of his sons, had exhibited anger against his mother, " Tell me, my son," said he, " do you know that certain persons are called ungrateful?" " Certainly," replied the youth.
"And do you understand how it is they act that men give them this appellation ?"
"I do," said Lamprocles, " for it is those that have received a kindness, and that do not make a return when they are able to make one, whom they call ungrateful."
"
They then appear to you to class the ungrateful with the unjust?" " I think so." a.
"And have you ever considered whether, as it is thought unjust to make slaves of our friends, but just to make slaves of our enemies, so it is unjust to be ungrateful to­ wards our friends, but just to be so towards our enemies ?” ‘ I certainly have," answered Lamprocles, "and from whom­ soever a man receives a favour, whether friend or enemy, and does not endeavour to make a return for it, he is in my opinion unjust."3. “If such, then, be the case,” pursued Socrates, “ ingra­ titude must be manifest injustice?”
Lamprocles expressed his assent. " The greater benefits, therefore, a person has received, and makes no return, the more unjust he must be.”
He assented to this position also. " Whom, then," asked Socrates, "can we find receiving greater benefits from any persons than children receive from their parents ?
children whom their parents have brought from non-existence into ex­ istence, to view so many beautiful objects, and to share in so many blessings, as the gods grant to men;
blessings which appear to us so inestimable, that we shrink, in the highest degree, from relinquishing them;
and governments have made death the penalty for the most heinous crimes, in the sup­ position that they could not suppress injustice by the terror of any greater evil.
4. You do not, surely, suppose that men beget children merely to gratify their passions, since the streets are full, as well as the brothels, of means to allay desire;
but what we evidently consider, is, from what sort of women the finest1 children may be born to us, and, uniting with them, we beget children.
5. The man maintains her who joins with him to produce offspring, and provides, for the children that are likely to be born to him, whatever he thinks will conduce to their support, in as great abundance as he can ;
while the woman receives and bears the burden, oppressed and endan­ gering her life, and imparting a portion of the nutriment with which she herself is supported ;
and, at length, after bearing it the full time, and bringing it forth with great pain, she suckles and cher shes it, though she has received no previous benefit from it, nor does the infant know by whom it is tended, nor is it able to signify what it wants, but she, conjecturing what will nourish and please it, tries to satisfy its calls, and feeds it for a long time, both night and day, submitting to the trouble and not knowing what return she will receive for it.
6. Nor does it satisfy the parents merely to feed their offspring, but as soon as the children appear capable of learning anything, they teach them whatever they know that may be of use for their conduct in life;
and whatever they consider another more capable of communicating than themselves, they send their sons to him at their own expense, and take care to adopt every course that their children may be as much improved as possible.
"7. Upon this the young man said, “ But, even if she has done all this, and many times more than this, no one, assuredly, could endure her ill-humour,” “ And which do you think," asked Socrates, more difficult to be endured, " the ill-humour of a wild beast, or that of a mother ?
”"I think," replied Lamprocles, " that of a mother, at least of such a mother as mine is.,, " Has she ever then inflicted any hurt upon you, by biting or kicking you, as many have often suffered from wild beasts ? "
8. “ No ;
but, by Jupiter, she says such things as no one would endure to hear for the value of all that he possesses." "
And do you reflect," returned Socrates, " how much grievous trouble you have given her by your peevish­ ness, by voice and by action, in the day and in the night, and how much anxiety you have caused her when you were ill ? ” “
But I have never said or done anything to her,” re­ plied Lamprocles, " at which she could feel ashamed."
9. " Do you think it, then," inquired Socrates, "a more difficult thing for you to listen to what she says, than for actors to listen when they utter the bitterest reproaches against one another in tragedies?" “ But actors, I imagine, endure such re­ preaches easily, because they do not think that, of the speakers, the one who utters reproaches, utters them with intent to do harm, or that the one who utters threats, utters them with any evil purpose." "
Yet you are displeased at your mother, although you well know that whatever she says, she not only says nothing with intent to do you harm, but that lie wishes you more good than any other human being.
Or do you sup­ pose that your mother meditates evil towards you ? ” “ No indeed,” said Lamprocles, "that I do not imagine."
10. “ Do you then say that this mother,” rejoined Socrates, "who is so benevolent to you, who, when you are ill, takes care of you, to the utmost of her power, that you may recover your health, and that you may want nothing that is necessary fur you, and who, besides, entreats the gods for many blessings on your head, and pays vows for you, is a harsh mother ?
For my part, I think that if you cannot endure such a mother, you cannot endure anything that is good?
11. But tell me," continued he, " whether you think that you ought to fay re­ spect to any other human being, or whether you are resolved to try to please nobody, and to follow or obey neither a general nor any other commander ? " " No indeed," replied Lamprocles, "I have formed no such resolution."
12. “Are you then willing," inquired Socrates, " to cultivate the good-will of your neighbour, that lie may kindle a fire for you when you Want it, or aid you in obtaining some good, or, if you happen to meet with any misfortune, may assist you with willing and ready help ? "
"I am," replied he. "
Or would it make no difference,” rejoined Socrates, “ whether a fellow-traveller, or fellow-voyager, or any other person that you met with, should be your friend or enemy ?
Or do you think that you ought to cultivate their good-will?"
"I think that I ought," re­ plied Lamprocles.
is. "
You are then prepared,” returned So­ crates, " to pay attention to such persons ;
and do you think that you ought to pay no respect to your mother, who loves you more than any one else ?
Do you not know that the state takes no account of any other species of ingratitude, nor allow?
any action at law for it, overlooking such as receive a favour and make no return for it, but that if a person does not pay due regard to his parents, it imposes a punishment on him,1 rejects his services, and does not allow him to hold the arch­ onship, considering that such a person cannot piously perform the sacrifices offered for the country, or discharge any other duty with propriety and justice.
Indeed if any one does not keep up the sepulchres of his dead parents, the state inquires into it in the examinations of candidates for office.
14. You therefore, my son, if you are wise, will entreat the gods to pardon you if you have been wanting in respect towards your mother, lest, regarding you as an ungrateful person, they should be disinclined to do you good ;
and you will have regard, also, to the opinion of men, lest, observing you to be neglectful of your parents, they should all contemn you, and you should then be found destitute of friends;
for if men surmise that you arc ungrateful towards your parents, no one will believe that if he does you a kindness he will meet with gratitude in return.
"Socrates, hearing that two brothers, Chærephon and Chærecrates, had quar­ relled, recommends brotherly love to Chærecrates by the following argu­ ments.
A brother ought to be regarded as a friend, and esteemed more than wealth, sect.
1;
for wealth is an uncertain possession, if the possess or of it is destitute of friends, 2, 3. Fraternal love an appointment of Nature;
and men who have brothers are more respected than those who have one, 4. Even though a brother should conceive ill feelings towards us, we should still endeavour to conciliate him, 5—9.
How such concili­ ation may be effected, 10—14.
The endeavour to conciliate is still more the duty of a younger than of an elder brother, and the more noble the disposition of a brother is, the more easy will it he to conciliate him, 15—17.
Brothers should act in unison with one another, like different members of the same body, 18, 19.1.
SOCRATES, having observed that Chærephon and Chære crates, two brothers well known to hint, were at variance with each other, and having met with Chærecrates, said, “ Tell me, Chærecrates, you surely are not one of those men, are you, who think wealth more valuable than brothers, when wealth is but a senseless thing, and a brother endowed with reason, when wealth needs protection, while a brother can afford pro­ tection, and when wealth, besides, is plentiful, and a brother but one?
1
2. It is wonderful, too, that a man should con­ sider brothers to be a detriment to him, because he does not possess his brothers' fortunes, while he does not consider his fellow-citizens to be a detriment, because he does not possess their fortunes;
but, in the latter case, he can reason with himself, that it is better for him, living in society with many, to enjoy a competency in security, than, living alone, to possess all the property of his fellow-citizens in fear of danger, while, with regard to brothers, he knows not how to apply such rea- soning.
3. Those who are able, too, purchase slaves, that they may have helpers in their work, and procure friends, as being in need of supporters, while they neglect their brothers, as if friends could be made of fellow-citizens, but could not be made of brothers.
4. Yet it surely conduces greatly to friend­ ship to have been born of the same parents, and to have been brought up together, since, even among brutes, a certain affec­ tion springs up between those that are reared together.
In addition to these considerations, men pay more respect to those who have brothers than to those who have none, and are less forward to commit aggression on them.
”5. To this Chærecrates made answer, " If, indeed, Socrates, the dissension between us were not great, it might perhaps be my duty to bear with my brother, and not shun his society for slight causes;
for a brother, as you say, is a valuable possession, if he be such as he ought to be;
but when he is nothing of the sort, and is indeed quite the reverse of what he should be, why should I attempt impossibilities ?"
6. " Whether, then, Chærecrates,” rejoined Socrates, " is Chærephon unable to please anybody, as he is unable to please you, or are there some whom he certainly can please ?" "
Yes," replied Chærecrates, " for it is for this very reason that I justly hate him, that he can please others, while to me he is on all occasions, whenever he comes in contact with me, a harm rather than a good, both in word and deed."
7. " IS the ease then thus,” said Socrates, " that as a horse is a harm to him who knows not how to manage him, and yet tries to do so, so a brother is a harm, when a person tries to manage him without knowing how to do it ?"
8. " But how can I be ignorant," replied Chærecrates.
“how to manage my brother, when I know how to speak well of him who speaks well of me, and to do well to him who does well to me ?
As to one, however, who seeks to vex me both by word and deed, f should not be able either to speak well of him, or to act well towards him, nor will I try."
9. " You speak strangely, Chærecrates," rejoined Socrates, “ for if a dog of yours were of service to watch your sheep, and fawned upon your shep­ herds, but snarled when you approached him, you would for­ bear to show any ill feeling towards him, but would endeavour to tame him by kindness;
but as for your brother, though you admit that he would be a great good to you if he were such as lie ought to be, and though you confess that you know how to act and speak well with respect to him, you do not even attempt to make him of such service to you as he might be.”1 10. " I fear, Socrates," replied Chærecrates, " that I have not wisdom enough to render Chærephon such as he ought to be towards me." " Yet there is no need to contrive anything artful or novel to act upon him,” said Socrates, " as it appears to me;
for I think that he may be gained over by means which you already know, and may conceive a high es­ teem for you.”
11. " Tell me first," said the other, " whether you have observed that I possess any love-charm, which I was not aware that I knew ? "
“Answer me this question," said Socrates:
"if you wished to induce any one of your ac­ quaintance, when he offered sacrifice, to invite you to his feast, what would you do?”
"I should doubtless begin by inviting him when I offered sacrifice.”
12. "And if you wished to prevail on any of your friends to take care of your property, when you went from home, what would you do ? " "I should certainly first offer to take care of his property, when he went from home."
13. "And if you wished to induce an acquaintance in a foreign land to receive you hospitably when you visited his country, what would you do ?”
"I should unquestionably be the first to receive him hospitably when he came to Athens;
and if I wished him to be desirous to effect for me the objects for which I went thither, it is clear that I must first confer a similar service on him." it.
“Have you not long been un­ awares acquainted, then, with all the love-charms that exist among mankind ?
Or are you afraid," continued Socrates, " to make the first advances, lest you should seem to degrade yourself, if you should be the first to propitiate your brother ?
Yet he is thought to be a man deserving of great praise, who is the first to do harm to the enemy, and to do good to his friends.
If, then, Chærephon had appeared to me more likely to bring you to this frame of mind, I would have endeavoured to persuade him first to try to make you his friend ;
but, as things stand, you seem more likely, if you take the lead, to effect the desired object.”
IS. "
You speak unreasonably, Socrates," rejoined Chærecrates, “ and not as might be expected from you, when you desire me, who am the younger, to take the lead;
for the established practice among all men is quite the reverse, being that the elder should always be first, both to act and speak." if-,.
“How,” said So­ crates;
" is it not the custom everywhere that the younger should yield the path to the elder when he meets him, rise from his seat before him, honour him with the softest couch, and give place to him in conversation?
Do not therefore hesitate, my good young friend, but endeavour to conciliate your brother, and he will very soon listen to you.
Do you not see how fond of honour, and how liberal-minded, he is ?
Mean-minded persons you cannot attract more effectually than by giving them something;
but honourable and good men you may best gain by treating them in a friendly spirit."
17. “ But what if he should become no kinder," said Chærecra­ tes, “after I have done what you advise ?” "
It will be of no consequence," replied Socrates, "for what other risk will you run but that of showing that you arc kind and full of brother­ ly aflèction, and that lie is mean-spirited and unworthy ot any kindness ?
But I apprehend no such result;
for I con­ ceive that when lie finds you challenging him to such a con­ test, he will be extremely emulous to excel you in doing kindnesses both by word and deed.
18. At present, you are in the same case as if the two hands, which the gods have made to assist each other, should neglect this duty, and begin to impede each other;
or as if the two feet, formed by divine providence to co-operate with one another, should give up this office, and obstruct one another, 19.
Would it not be a. great folly and misfortune to use for our hurt what was formed for our benefit?
And indeed, as it appears to me, the gods have designed brothers to be of greater mutual service than the hands, or feet, or eyes, or other members which they have made in pairs for men ;
for the hands, if required to do things, at the same time, at greater distance than a fathom, would be unable to do them ;
the feet cannot reach two objects, at the same time, that are distant even a fathom;
and the eyes, which seem to reach to the greatest distance, cannot, of objects that arc much nearer, see at the same time those that are be­ fore and behind them ;
but brothers, if they are in friendship, can, even at the greatest distance, act in concert and for mu­ tual benefit.
"On the value of friendship.
Many are more desirous to acquire property than friends, sect.
1—4. But no species of property is more valuable, lasting, and useful than a good friend:
his qualities enumerated, 5—7.I.
I HEARD him, also, on one occasion, holding a discourse concerning friends,1 by which, as it seems to me, a person might be greatly benefited, both as to the acquisition and use of friends ;
for he said that lie had heard many people observe that a true and honest friend was the most valuable of all possessions, but that he saw the greater part of mankind at­ tending to anything rather than securing friends.
2. He ob­ served them, he added, industriously endeavouring to procure houses and lands, slaves, cattle, and furniture;
but as for a friend, whom they called the greatest of blessings, he saw the majority considering neither how to procure one, nor how those whom they had might be retained.
3. Even when friends and slaves were sick, he said that he noticed people calling in physicians to their slaves, and carefully providing other means for their recovery, but paying no attention to their friends;
and that, if both died, they grieved for their slaves, and thought that they had suffered a loss, but con­ sidered that they lost nothing in losing friends.
Of their other possessions they left nothing untended or unheeded, but when their friends required attention, they utterly neg­ lected them.
4.
In addition to these remarks, he observed that he saw the greater part of mankind acquainted with the number of their other possessions, although they might be very numer­ ous, but of their friends, though but few, they were not only ignorant of the number, but even when they attempted to reckon it to such as asked them, they set aside again2 some that they had previously counted among their friends;
so little did they allow their friends to occupy their thougnts.
5. Yet in comparison with what possession, of all others, would not a good friend appear far more valuable ?
What sort of horse, or yoke of oxen, is so useful as a truly good friend?
What slave is so well-disposed or so attached, or what other acqui­ sition so beneficial?
6. For a good friend is ready to supply whatever is wanting on the part of his friend, whether in his private affairs, or for the public interests ;
if he is re­ quired to do a service to any one, he assists him with the means ;
if any apprehension alarms him, he lends him his aid, sometimes sharing expenditure with him, sometimes co-oper­ ating with him, sometimes joining with him to persuade others, sometimes using force towards others;
frequently cheering him when he is successful, and frequently support­ ing him when he is in danger of falling.
7. What the hands do, what the eyes foresee, what the cars hear, what the feet accomplish, for each individual, his friend, of all such ser­ vices, fails to perform no one ;
and oftentimes, what a person has not effected for himself, or has not seen, or has not heard, or has not accomplished, a friend has succeeded in ex­ ecuting for his friend ;
and yet, while people try to foster trees for the sake of their fruit, the greater portion of mankind are heedless and neglectful1 of that most productive possession which is called a friend.
On the different estimation in which different friends are to be held.
We ought to examine ourselves, and ascertain at what value we may expect our friends to hold us.1.
I HEARD one day another dissertation of his, which seemed to me to exhort the hearer to examine himself, and ascertain of how much value he was to his friends.
Finding that one of his followers was neglectful of a friend who was oppressed with poverty, he asked Antisthenes, in the presence of the man that neglected his friend, and of several others, saying, “Are there certain settled values for friends, Antis­ thenes, as there are for slaves?
2. For, of slaves, one, per­ haps, is worth two minæ, another not even half a mina, ano­ ther five minæ, another ten.
Nicias, the SOil of Niceratus, is said to have bought an overseer for his silver mines1 at the prise of a whole talent.
I am therefore considering whether, as there are certain values for slaves, there are also certain values for friends."
3. " There are, undoubtedly," replied Antisthenes;
“at least I, for my part, should wish one man to be my friend rather than have two mince ;
another I should not value even at half a mina;
another I should prefer to ten minæ;
and another I would buy for my friend at the sacri­ fice of all the money and revenues in the world."
2 4. “If such be the ease, therefore," said Socrates, “it would be well for each of us to examine himself, to consider of what value he is in the estimation of his friends;
and to try to be of as much value to them as possible, in order that his friends may be less likely to desert him;
for I often hear one man saying that his friend has abandoned him, and another, that a person whom he thought to be his friend has preferred a mina to him.
5. I am considering, accordingly, whether, as one sells a bad slave, and parts with him for whatever he will fetch, so it may be advisable to give up a worthless friend, when there is an opportunity of receiving more than he is worth.
Good slaves I do not often see sold at all, or good friends aban­ doned.
”What sort of persons we should choose for our friends, sect.
I—5.
How we may ascertain the characters of men, before we form a friendship wilh them, 6, 7. How we may attach men to us as friends, 8—13.
Friend­ ship can exist only between the good and honourable, 14—19;
between whom it will continue to subsist in spite of differences of opinion, 19—28.
Deductions from the preceding remarks, 29—39.I. HE appeared to me, also, to make his followers wise in examining what sort of persons it was right to attach to themselves as friends, by such conversations as the following.
“Tell me, Critobulus," said he, " if we were in need of a good friend, how should we proceed to look for one ?
Should we not, in the first place, seek for a person who can govern his appetite, his inclination to wine or sensuality, and abstain from immoderate sleep and idleness ?
for one who is overcome by such propensities would be unable to do his duty either to himself or his friend.”
“Assuredly he would not," said Critobulus. "
It appears then to you that we must avoid one who is at the mercy of such inelinations?”
“Undoubtedly,” replied Critobulus.
2. “Besides,” continued Socrates, “does not a man who is extravagant and yet unable to support him­ self, but is always in want of assistance from his neighbour, a man who, when lie borrows, cannot pay, and when he cannot borrow, hates him who will not lend, appear to you to be a dangerous friend?”
“Assuredly,” replied Critobulus.
“We must therefore avoid such a character?"
“We must indeed,” a.
“Again :
what sort of friend would he be who has the means of getting money, and covets great wealth, and who, on this account, is a driver of hard bargains, and delights to receive, but is unwilling to pay?”
Such a person appears to me,” said Critobulus, “ to be a still worse character than the former.”
4. “What then do you think of him, who, from love of getting money, allows himself no time for thinking of any­ thing else but whence he may obtain it?"
“We must avoid him, as it seems to me;
for he would be useless to any one that should make an associate of him.”
“And what do you think of him who is quarrelsome, and likely to raise up many enemies against his friends?”
“We must avoid him also, by Jupiter."
"But if a man have none of these bad qualities, but is content to receive obligations, taking no thought of re­ turning them?”
“He also would he useless as a friend.
But what sort of person, then, Socrates, should we endea­ your to make our friend ?”
5. “A person, I think, who, being the reverse of all this, is proof against the seductions of bodily pleasures, is upright and fair in his dealings, and emulous not to be outdone in serving those who serve him, so that he is of advantage to those who associate with him."
6. How then shall we find proof of these qualities in him, Socrates, before we associate with him?" " We make proof of statu­ aries," rejoined Socrates, " not by forming opinions from their words, but, whomsoever we observe to have executed his pre­ vious statues skilfully, we trust that he will execute others well."
7. "You mean, then, that the man who is known to have served his former friends, will doubtless be likely to serve such as may be his friends hereafter?"
"Yes;
for whom­ soever I know to have previously managed horses with skill, I expect to manage other horses also with skill."8. "Be it so," said Critubulus ;
"but by what means must we make a friend of him who appears to us worthy of our friendship?"
"In the first place," answered Socrates, "we must consult the gods, whether they recommend us to make him our friend." "
Can you tell me, then," said Critobulus, " how he, who appears eligible to us, and whom the gods do not disapprove, is to be secured?"
9. "Assuredly," returned Socrates, " he is not to be caught by tracking him like the hare, or by wiles, like birds, or by making him prisoner by force, like enemies;
for it would be an arduous task to make a man your friend against his will, or to hold him fast if you were to bind him like a slave;
for those who suffer such treat­ ment are rendered enemies rather than friends." to.
"How then are men made friends?" inquired Critobulus.
They say that there are certain incantations, which those who know them, chant to whomsoever they please, and thus make them their friends ;
and that there arc also love-potions, which those who know them, administer to whomsoever they will, and arc in consequence beloved by them."
11. "And how can we dis­ cover these charms?"
"You have heard from Homer the song which the Sirens sung to Ulysses, the commencement of which runs thus:
ceived such a suspicion, lie would rather be rendered an enemy, and would repel men from him ;
as, for instance, if a person were to praise as beautiful, and tall, and strong, one who is conscious that he is short, and deformed, and weak.
But," added Critobulus, " do yon know any other charms ? " 13. "No," said Socrates, "but I have heard that Pericles knew many, which lie used to chant to the city, and make it love him." "
And how did Themistocles make the city love him?"
"Not, by Jupiter, by uttering charms to it, but by conferring1 on it some advantage."
14. " You appear to me to mean, Socrates, that if we would attach to us any good person as a friend, we ourselves should be good both in speak­ ing and acting."
2 "And did you think it possible," said So­ crates, " for a bad person to attach to himself good men as his friends?"
15. "I have seen," rejoined Critobulus, "bad orators become friends to good orators, and men bad at com­ manding an army become friends to men eminently good in the military art."
16. Do you, then," said Socrates, "re­ garding the subject of which we are speaking,3 know any persons, who, being themselves useless, can make useful per sons their friends ? "
"No, by Jupiter," replied Critobulus;
" hilt if it is impossible for a worthless person to attach to him­ self good and honourable friends, it becomes now an object of consideration with me, whether it is possible for one who is himself honourable and good, to become, with case, a friend to the honourable and good."
17. " What perplexes you, Cri­ tobulus, is, that you often see men who are honourable in their conduct, and who refrain from everything disgraceful, involved, instead of being friends, in dissensions with one another, and showing more severity towards each other than the worthless part of mankind."
18. " Nor is it only private persons," rejoined Critobulus, "that act in this manner, but even whole communities, which have the greatest regard for what is honourable, and are least inclined to anything dis­ graceful, are often hostilely disposed towards one another.in.
When I reflect on these differences," continued Crito­ bulus, “I am quite in despair about the acquisition of friends ;
for I see that the bad cannot be friends with one another;
for how can the ungrateful, or careless, or avaricious, or faithless, or intemperate, be friends to each other ?
indeed the had appear to me to be altogether disposed by nature to be mutual enemies rather than friends.
20, Again, the bad, as yon observe, can never harmonize in friendshipwith the good ;
for how can those who commit bad actions be friends with those who abhor such actions?
And yet, if those also who practise virtue fall into dissensions with one another about pre-eminence in their respective communities, and even hate each other through envy, who will ever be friends, or among what class of mankind shall affection and attachment b found?"
21. “But these affections act in various ways," re­ joined Socrates, "for men have by nature inclinations to attacliment, since they stand in need of each other, and feel compassion for each other, and co-operate for mutual benefit, and, being conscious that such is the case, have a sense of gratitude towards one another;
but they have also propen­ sities to enmity, for such as think the same objects honour­ able and desirable, engage in contention for them, and, divided in feelings, become enemies.
Disputation and anger lend to war;
the desire of aggrandizement excites ill-will ;
and envy is followed by hatred.
22. But, nevertheless, friendship, in­ sinnating itself through all these hindrances, unites together the honourable and good ;
for such characters, through affec­ tion for virtue, prefer the enjoyment of a moderate competency without strife, to the attainment of unlimited power by means of war ;
they can endure hunger and thirst without discon­ tent, and take only a fair share of meat and drink, and, though delighted with the attractions of youthful beauty, they can control themselves, so as to forbear from offending those whom they ought not to offend.
23. By laying aside all avaricious feelings too, they can not only be satisfied with their lawful share of the common property, but can even assist one another.
They can settle their differences, not only without mutual offence, but even to their mutual benefit.
They can prevent their anger from going so far as to cause them repentance;
and envy they entirely banish, by sharing their own property with their friends, and considering that of their friends as their own.
24. " How, then, can it be otherwise than natural, that the honourable and good should be sharers in political dis­ tinctions, not only without detriment, but even with advan­ tage, to each other?
Those indeed who covet honour and power in states, merely that they may be able to embezzle money, to do violence to others, and to live a life of luxury, must be regarded as imprincipled and abandoned characters, and incapable of harmonious union with other men.
25. But when a person wishes to attain honours in a community, in order, not merely that he may not suffer wrong himself, but that he may assist his friends as far as is lawful, and may endeavour, in his term of office, to do some service to his country, why should he not, being of such a character, form a close union with another of similar character?
Will he be less able to benefit his friends if he unite himself with the honourable and good, or will he he less able to serve his coun­ try if he have the honourable and good fOr his colleagues?
26.
In the public games, indeed, it is plain, that if the strong­ est were allowed to unite and attack the weaker, they would conquer in all the contests, and carry off all the prizes ;
and accordingly people, do not permit them, in those competitions, to act in such a manner;
but since, in political affairs,1 in which honourable and good men rule, no one hinders another from serving his country in concert with whomsoever he pleases, how can it be otherwise than profitable for him to conduct affairs with the best men as his friends, having these as colleagues and co-operators, rather than antagonists, in his proceedings?
27. It is evident, too, that if one man com­ mences hostilities against another, lie will need allies, and will need a great number of them, if he oppose the honourable and good ;
and those who consent to be his allies must be well treated by him, that they may be zealous in his interests ;
and it is much better for him to serve the best characters, who are the fewer, than the inferior, who are more numerous ;
for the bad require far more favours than the good.
28. But strive with good courage, Critobulus,” he continued, " to be good yourself, and, having become so, endeavour to gain the friendship of men of honour and virtue.
Perhaps
I myself also may be able to assist you in this pursuit of the honourable and virtuous, from being naturally disposed to love, for, for whatever persons I conceive a liking, I devote myself with ardour, and with my whole mind, to love them, and be loved in return by them, regretting their absence to have mine regretted by them, and longing for their society while they on the other hand long for mine.
29. I know that you also must cultivate such feelings, whenever you desire to form a friendship with any person.
Do not conceal from my knowledge, therefore, the persons to whom you may wish to become a friend ;
for, from my carefulness to please those who please me, I do not think that I am unskilled in the art of gaining men's affections."so. " Indeed, Socrates,” replied Critobulus, “ I have long desired to receive such instructions as yours, especially if the same knowledge will have effect at once on those who are amiable in mind, and handsome in person."
31. “ But, Crito­ bulus,” replied Socrates, “ there is nothing in the knowledge that I communicate to make those who are handsome in per­ son endure him who lays hands upon them;
for I am per­ suaded that men shrunk from Scylla because she offered to put her hands on them ;
while every one, they say, was ready to listen to the Sirens, and were enchanted as they listened, because they laid hands on no one, but sang to all men from a distance.”
32. “ On the understanding, then, that I shall lay my hands on no one," said Critobulus, "tell me if you know any effectual means for securing friends."
"But will you never," asked Socrates, " apply your lips to theirs ?” “ Be of good courage, Socrates," said Critobulus, " for I will never apply my lips to those of any person, unless that person be beauti­ ful." " You have now said,” rejoined Socrates, “ the exact contrary to what will promote your object;
for the beautiful1 will not allow such liberties, though the deformed receive them with pleasure, thinking that they arc accounted beau­ tiful for their mental qualities."
33. As I shall caress the beautiful, then," said Critobulus, "and caress the good with the utmost ardour, teach me, with confidence, the art of at­ taching my friends to me." “
When, therefore, Critobulus," said Socrates, "you wish to become a friend to any one, will you permit me to say to him concerning you, that you admire him, and desire to be his friend ?" "
You may say so," an­ swered Critobulus, “ for I have never known any one dislike those who praised him."
34. " But if I say of you, in addition, that, because you admire him, you feel kindly disposed to­ wards him, will you not think that false information is given of you by me ?” “
No :
for a kind feeling springs up in my­ self also towards those whom I regard as kindly disposed towards me.”
35. “ Such information, then," continued So­ crates, " I may communicate regarding you to such as you may wish to make your friends;
but if you enable me also to say concerning you, that you are attentive to your friends ;
that you delight in nothing so much as in the possession of good friends;
that you pride yourself on the honourable con­ duct of your friends not less than on your own ;
that you rejoice at the good fortune of your friends not less than at your own ;
that you are never weary of contriving means by which good fortune may come to your friends ;
and that you think it the great virtue of a man to surpass his friends in do­ ing them good and his enemies in doing them harm, I think that I shall be a very useful assistant to you in gaining the affections of worthy friends."
36. “ But why," said Crito­ bulus, " do you say this to me, as if you were not at liberty to say of me anything you please?" " No, by Jupiter," replied Socrates;
“ I have no such liberty, according to a remark that I once heard from Aspasia;
for site said that skilful match- makers, by reporting with truth good points of character, had great influence in leading people to form unions, but that those who said what was false, did no good by their praises, for that such as were deceived hated each other and the match-maker alike;
and as I am persuaded that this opinion is correct, I think that I ought not to say, when I praise you, anything that I cannot utter with truth."
37. " You are, therefore," returned Critobulus, “ a friend of such a kind to me, Socrates, as to assist me, if I have myself any qualities adapted to gain friends;
but if not, you would not be willing to invent any­ thing to serve me." “ And whether, Critobulus,” said So­ crates, “ should I appear to serve you more by extolling you with false praises, or by persuading you to endeavour to be­ come a truly deserving man ?
38. If this point is not clear to you, consider it with the following illustrations:
If, wishing to make the owner of a ship your friend, I should praise you falsely to him, pronouncing you a skilful pilot, and he, believing me, should intrust his ship to you to steer when you are incapable of steering it, would you have any expectation that you would not destroy both yourself and the ship ?
Or if, by false representations, I should persuade the state, publicly, to intrust itself to you as a man skilled in military tactics, in judicial proceedings, or in political affairs, what do you think that yourself and the state would suffer at your hands ?
Or if, In private intercourse, I should induce any of the citizens, by unfounded statements, to commit their property to your care, as being a good and diligent manager, would you not, when you came to give proof of your abilities, be convicted of dis­ honesty, and make yourself appear ridiculous ?
39. But the shortest, and safest, and best way, Critobulus, is, to strive to be really good in that in which you wish to be thought good.
Whatever are called virtues among mankind, you will find, on consideration, capable of being increased by study and exer­ cise.
I am of opinion, that it is in accordance with these sentiments, that we ought to endeavour to acquire friends ;
if you know any other way, make me acquainted with it."
"I should be indeed ashamed,” replied Critobulus, " to say any­ thing in opposition to such an opinion ;
for I should say what was neither honourable nor true.
”Jocrates endeavoured to alleviate the necessities of his friends by his instruc­ tions, and by exhorting them to assist each other.
In this chapter it is particularly shown that any person of liberal education may, when op­ pressed by poverty, honourably use his talents and accomplishments for his support.
1.
SUCH difficulties of his friends as arose from ignorance, ne endeavoured to remedy by his counsel;
such as sprung from poverty, by admonishing them to assist each other ac­ cording to their means.
With reference to this point, I will relate what I know of him from having been an car-witness of what he said.
Observing Aristarchus,1 on one occasion, looking gloomily, “ You seem," said he, “ Aristarchus, to be taking something to heart;
but you ought to impart the cause of your uneasiness to your friends;
for perhaps we may by some means lighten it."
2. "I am indeed, Socrates," replied Aristarchus, "in great perplexity ;
for since the city has been disturbed,2 and many of our people have fled to the Piræcus, my surviving sisters, and nieces, and cousins have gathered about me in such numbers, that there arc now in my house fourteen free- born persons.
3
At the same time, we receive no profit from our lands, for the enemy are in possession of them ;
nor any rent from our houses, for but few inhabitants are left in the city;
no one will buy our furniture, nor is it possible to bor­ row money from any quarter;
a person, indeed, as it seems to me, would sooner find money by seeking it on the road, than get it by borrowing.
It is a grievous thing to me, therefore, to leave my relations to perish ;
and it is impossible for me to support such a number under such circumstances."
3. So­ crates, on hearing this, replied, "
And how is it that Cera­ nion,4 yonder, though maintaining a great number of people, is not only able to procure what is necessary for himself and them, but gains so much more, also, as to be positively rich, while you, having many to support, arc afraid lest you should all perish for want of necessaries?"
Because, assuredly,” replied Aristarchus, “ he maintains slaves, while I have to support free-born persons.”
4. " And which of the two," in­ quired Socrates, " do you consider to be the better, the free- born persons that arc with you, or the slaves that are with Ceramon ?” “ I consider the free persons with me as the better.' “ Is it not then a disgrace that he should gain abund­ ance by means of the inferior sort, and that you should be in difficulties while having with you those of the better class?"
"Such certainly is the case;
but it is not at all wonderful;
for' he supports artisans ;
but I, persons of liberal education."
5. “ Artisans, then," asked Socrates, “are per­ sons that know how to make something useful ?" “ Unques­ tionably,” replied Aristarchus. " Is barley-meal, then, use­ ful ?" "Very." " Is bread?" " Not less so." "
And are men's and women's garments, coats, cloaks, and mantles, use­ ful?" "
They are all extremely useful."
"And do those who are residing with you, then, not know how to make any of these things ? " "
They know how to make them all, as I believe."
6. " And arc you not aware that from the manu­ facture of one of these articles, that of barley-meal, Nau­ sicydes2 supports not only himself and his household, but a great number of swine and oxen besides, and gains, indeed, so much more than he wants, that he often even assists the govern­ ment with his money ?
Are you not aware that Cyrebus, by making bread, maintains his whole household, and lives luxu­ riously ;
that Delea, of Collytus,3 supports himself by mak­ ing cloaks, Menon by making woollen cloaks, and that most of the Megarians live by making mantles ?"
"Certainly they do," said Aristarchus;
"for they purchase barbarian slaves and keep them, in order to force them to do what they please;
but I have with me free-born persons and relatives."
7. " Then," added Socrates, " because they are free and re­ lated to you, do you think that they ought to do nothing else but cat and sleep ?
Among other free persons, do you see that those who live thus spend their time more pleasantly, and do you consider them happier, than those who practise the arts which they know, and which arc useful to support life ?
Do you find that idleness and carelessness are serviceable to man­ kind, either for learning what it becomes them to know, or for remembering what they have learned, or for maintain­ ing the health and strength of their bodies, or for acquiring and preserving what is useful for the support of life, and that industry and diligence are of no service at all ?
8. And as to the arts which you say they know, whether did they learn them as being useless to maintain life, and with the in­ tention of never practising any of them, or, on the contrary, with a view to occupy themselves about them, and to reap profit from them ?
In which condition will men he moro temperate, living in idleness, or attending to useful employ­ ments ?
In which condition will they be more honest, if they work, or if they sit in idleness meditating how to procure necessaries ?
9. Under present circumstances, as I should sup­ pose, you neither feel attached to your relatives, nor they to you, for you find them burdensome to you, and the) see that you are annoyed with their company.
From such feelings there is danger that dislike may grow stronger and stronger, and that previous friendly inclinations may be diminished.
But if you take them under your direction, so that they may be em­ ployed, you will love them, when you see that they are ser­ viceable to you, and they will grow attached to you, when they find that you feel satisfaction in their society;
and remember­ ing past services with greater pleasure, you will increase the friendly feeling resulting from them, and consequently grow more attached and better disposed towards each other.
10. If, indeed, they were going to employ themselves in anything dishonourable, death would be preferable to it;
but the ac­ complishments which they know, are, as it appears, such as are most honourable and becoming to women;
and all people execute what they know with the greatest ease and expedition, and with the utmost credit and pleasure.
Do not hesitate, therefore," concluded Socrates, " to recommend to them this line of conduct, which will benefit both you and them;
and they, as it is probable, will cheerfully comply with your wishes.”
11. “By the gods," exclaimed Aristarchus, “you seem to me to give such excellent advice, Socrates, that though hitherto I did not like to borrow money, knowing that, when I had spent what I got, I should have no means of ro- paying it, I now think that I can endure to do so, in order to gain the necessary means for commencing work.
12.
The necessary means were accordingly provided ;
wool was bought;
and the women took their dinners as they con­ tinued at work, and supped when they had finished their tasks ;
they became cheerful instead of gloomy in countenance, and, instead of regarding each other with dislike, met the looks of one another with pleasure ;
they loved Aristarchus as their protector, and he loved them as being of use to him.
At last he came to Socrates, and told him with delight of the state of things in his house;
adding that "the women complained of him as being the only person in the house that ate the bread of idleness."
13. “ And do you not tell them,” said Socrates, " the fable of the dog ?
For they say that when beasts had the faculty of speech, the sheep said to her master, 'Jon act strangely, in granting nothing to us who supply you with wool, and lambs, and cheese, except what we get from the ground ;
while to the dog, who brings you no such profits, you give a share of the food which you take yourself.'
14. The do,-, hearing these remarks, said, 'And not indeed with­ out reason ;
for I am he that protects even yourselves, so that you are neither stolen by men, nor carried off by wolves ;
while, if I were not to guard you, you would be unable even to feed, for fear lest you should be destroyed.'
In consequence it is said that the sheep agreed that the dog should have supe­ rior honour.
You, accordingly, tell your relations that you are, in the place of the dog, their guardian and protector, and that, by your means, they work and live in security and plea­ sure.
without suffering injury from any one.
”Socrates persuades Eutherus, who was working for hire, to seek some more eligible employment, as his present occupation was not suited for old age, and recommends to him the post of steward to some rich man.
An ob­ jection on the part of Eutherus, that lie should dislike to have to render an account to a master, Socrates opposes with the remark that there is no office in the world free from responsibility.
I. SEEING an old friend one day, after a considerable inter­ val of time, he said, “Whence do you come, Eutherus ?"
"I am returned, Socrates," replied Eutherus, “ from my retire­ ment abroad at the conclusion of the war and I come now from the immediate neighbourhood ;
for since we were robbed of all our possessions beyond the borders, and my father left me nothing in Attica, I am obliged to live in the city and work with my own hands to procure the necessaries of life ;
but this seems to me better than to ask aid of anybody, espe­ cially as I have nothing on which I could borrow.”
2. " And how long,” said Socrates, " do you think that your bodily labour will serve to earn what you require ? " “ Not very long, by Jupiter,” replied Eutherus.
"Then," said Socrates, "when you grow older, you will doubtless be in want of money, and no one will be willing to give you wages for your bodily labour." "
What you say is true," rejoined Eutherus.
3. “ It will be better for you, therefore," continued Socrates, " to apply yourself immediately to some employment which will maintain you when you are old, and, attaching yourself to some one of those that have larger fortunes, (who requires a person to assist him,) and, superintending his works, help­ ing to gather in his fruits, and preserve his property, to benefit him, and to be benefited by him in return."
4. "I should with great reluctance, Socrates," said he, "submit to slavery."
"Yet those who have the superintendence in states, and who take care of the public interests, are not the more like slaves on that account, but are thought to have more of the free- man."
5. “ In a word, however,” rejoined Eutherus, “I am not at all willing to make myself liable to any one's censure." " But assuredly, Eutherus,” said Socrates, "it is not very easy to find an employment in which a person would not be ex­ posed to censure ;
for it is difficult to do anything so as to commit no error;
and it is difficult, even if you have done it without error, to meet with a considerate judge ;
for even in the occupation in which you are now engaged I should wonder if it be easy for you to go through it without blame.
6. But you must endeavour to avoid such employers as are given to censure, and seek such as are candid;
to undertake such duties as you are able to do, and to decline such as you cannot fulfil;
and to execute whatever you take upon you in the best manner and with the utmost zeal;
for I think that, by such conduct, you will be least exposed to censure, you will most readily find assistance in time of need, and you will live with the greatest ease and freedom from danger, and with the best pro­ vision for old age.
Crito, a rich man, complaining that he is harassed by informers, Socrates recommends him to secure the services of Archedemus, a poor man well skilled in the law, to defend him against them;
a plan by which both are benefited.
Archedemus also assists others, and gains both reputation and emolument.1.
I KNOW that he also heard Crito once observe, how difficult it was for a man who wished to mind his own busi­ ness to live at Athens.
1
"For at this very time," added he, " there are people bringing actions against me, not because they have suffered any wrong from me, but because they think that I would rather pay them a sum of money than have the trouble of law proceedings."
2. “ Tell me, Crito," said Socrates, " do you not keep dogs, that they may drive away the wolves from your sheep?" " Certainly," answered Crito, "for it is more profitable to me to keep them than not." "
Would you not then be inclined to keep a man also, who would be willing and able to drive away from you those that try to molest you ?"
"I would with pleasure," returned Crito, "if I were not afraid that he would turn against me."
3. " But do you not see," said Socrates, "that it would be much more pleasant for him to serve himself by gratifying such a man as you than by incurring your enmity.
And be assured that there are such characters here, who would be extremely ambitious to have you for a friend."4. In consequence of this conversation, they fixed upon Archedemus, a man of great ability both in speaking and acting, but poor;
for he was not of a character to make money by every means, but was a lover of honesty, and a person of superior mind, so that lie could draw money from the informers.'
Crito, therefore, whenever he gathered in his corn, or oil, or wine, or wool, or anything else that grew on his land, used to select a portion of it, and give it to Ar­ chedemus ;
and used to invite him whenever he sacrificed,2 and paid him attention in every similar way.
5. Archedemus, accordingly, thinking that Crito's house would be a place of refuge for him, showed him much respect, and quickly dis­ covered, on the part of Crito's accusers, many illegal acts, and many persons who were enemies to those accusers, one of whom he summoned to a public trial, in which it would be settled what lie should suffer or pay.
3
6. This person, being conscious of many crimes, tried every means to get out of the hands of Archedemus;
but Archedemus would not let him off, until he ceased to molest Crito, and gave himself a sum of money besides.
7.
When Archedemus had succeeded in this and some other similar proceedings, then, as when any shepherd has a good dog, other shepherds wish to station their flocks near him, in order to have the benefit of his dog, so likewise many of the friends of Crito begged him to lend them the services of Archedemus as a protector.
8. Archedemus willingly gratified Crito in this respect, and thus not only Crito himself was left at peace, but his friends.
And if any of those with whom lie was at variance taunted him with receiving favours from Crito, and paying court to him, Archedemus would ask, " whether is it disgraceful to be benefited by honest men, and to make them your friends by serving them in return, and to be at variance with the unprincipled, or to make the honourable and good your enemies by trying to wrong them, and to make the bad your friends by co-operating with them, and associate with the vicious instead of the virtuous ?"
From this time Archedemus was one of Crito's friends, and was honoured by the other friends of Crito.
Socrates exhorts Diodorus, a rich man, to aid his friend Hermogenes, who is in extreme poverty.
A man endeavours to preserve the life of a slave, and ought surely to use greater exertions to sate a friend, who will well repay our kindness.
I.
I AM aware that he also held a conversation with Dio­ dorns, one of his followers, to the following effect. "
Tell me, Diodorus,” said he, " if one of your slaves runs away, do you use any care to recover him?"
2. “ Yes, indeed," an­ swered he, “and I call others to my aid, by offering rewards for capturing him."
“And if any of your slaves falls ill," continued Socrates, “do you pay any attention to him, and call in medical men, that lie may not die?" "Certainly," replied the other.
"And if any one of your friends, who is far more valuable to you than all your slaves, is in danger of perishing of want, do you not think that it becomes you to take care of him, that his life may be saved ?
3. But you are not ignorant that Hermogenes is not ungrateful, and would be ashamed, if, after being assisted by you, he were not to serve you in return ;
and indeed to secure such a supporter as he, willing, well-disposed, steady, and not only able to do iliaS he is directed, but capable of being useful of himself, and of taking forethought, and forming plans for you, I consider equivalent to the value of many slaves.
4. Good economists say that you ought to buy, when you can purchase for a little what is worth much ;
but now, in consequence of the troubled state of affairs, it is possible to obtain good friends at a very easy rate."
5. " You say well, Socrates," rejoined Diodorus;
“ and therefore tell Hermogenes to come to me." “ No, by Jupiter," said Socrates, “I shall not;
for I think it not so honourable for you to send for him as to go yourself to him;
nor do I consider it a greater benefit to him than to you that this intercourse should take place."
6. Diodorus accordingly went to Hermogenes, and secured, at no great expense, a friend who made it his business to consider by what words or deeds he could profit or please Diodorus.
Socrates used to exhort those who aspired to publio offices to learn the duties that would be required in them.
The duties of a military com­ mander, and his responsibilities, sect.
1—5. lie must know many things besides military taeties, 6—11.1.
I WILL.
now show that Socrates was of great service to those who aspired to posts of honour,' by rendering them attentive to the duties of the offices which they sought.
Having heard that Dionysodorus2 had arrived at the city, offering to teach the art of a general, he said to one of those who were with him, whom he observed to be desirous of obtaining that honour in the state, 2. “ It is indeed unbe­ coming, young man, that he who wishes to be commander of an army in his country should neglect to learn the duties of that office when he has an opportunity of learning them;
and such a person would be far more justly punished by his coun­ try than one who should contract to make statues for it, when he had not learned to make them ;
3.
for as the whole state, in the perils of war, is intrusted to the care of the general, it is likely that great advantages will occur if he act well, and great evils if he fall into error.
How, then, would not he, who neglects to learn the duties of the office, while he is eager to be elected to it, be deservedly punished?"
By making such observations, he induced the young man to go and learn.
4.
When, after having learned, he returned to Socrates again, he began to joke upon him, saying, “ Since Homer, my friends, has represented Agamemnon as dignified,1 does not this young mail, after learning to be a general, seem to you to look more dignified than before?
For as he who has learned to play the lyre is a lyrist, though he may not use the instru­ ment, and he who has learned the art of healing is a physician, though he may not practise his art, so this youth will from henceforth be a general, though no one may elect him to com­ mand ;
but he who wants the proper knowledge is neither general nor physician, even though he be chosen to act as such by all the people in the world.
5. But," he continued, " in order that we may have a better knowledge of the mili­ tary art, in case any one of us should have to command a troop or company under you, tell us how he began to teach you generalship?"
"He began," replied the youth, “with the same thing with which he ended ;
for he taught me tactics, and nothing else."
6. “But," said Socrates, " how small a part of the qualifications of a general is this !
For a general must be skilful in preparing what is necessary for war, able2 in securing provisions for his troops, a man of great contrivance and activity, careful, persevering, and sagacious ;
kind, and yet severe;
open, yet crafty ;
careful of his own, yet ready to steal from others ;
profuse, yet rapacious ;
lavish of presents, yet eager to acquire money ;
cautions, yet enter­ prising ;
and many other qualities there are, both natural and acquired, which he, who would fill the office of general with ability, must possess.
7. It is good, indeed, to be skilled in tactics;
for a well-arranged army is very different from a disorderly one;
as stones and bricks, wood and tiles, if thrown together in confusion, are of no use whatever;
but when the stones and tiles, materials not likely to rot or decay, are placed at the bottom and the top, and the bricks and wood are arranged in the middle, (as in building,) a house, which is a valuable piece of property, is formed."
1 8. “ What you have said, Socrates," rejoined the youth, “ is an exact illustration of our practice;
for in the field of battle we must place the bravest troops in the front and rear, and the cowardly in the middle, that they may be led on by those before them, and pushed forward by those behind."
2 9. “If indeed he has taught you to distinguish the brave and cowardly," rejoined Socrates, " that rule may be of use ;
but if not, what profit is there in what you have learned?
for if he ordered you, in arranging a number of coins, to lay the best first and last, and the worst in the middle, and gave you no instructions how to distinguish the good and bad, his orders to you would be to no purpose."
"But indeed," he replied, " lie did not teach me this;
so that we must distinguish the brave from the cowardly ourselves.”3 10. “ Why should we not consider then," said Socrates, " how we may avoid mistakes as to that matter?"
"I am willing," returned the young man. "
If then we had to capture a sum of money, and were to place the most covetous men in front, should we not arrange them properly?"
"It appears so to me."
"And what must generals do when entering on a perilous enterprise?
Must they not place the most ambitious in front?”
"They at Least," said the young man, "are those who are ready to brave danger for the sake of praise;
and they are by no means difficult to discover, but will be everywhere con­ spicuous and easy to be selected.”4 11. But did your in- structor," inquired Socrates, " teach you to arrange an army, merely, or did lie tell you for what purpose, and in what manner, you must employ each division of your forces?"
“Not at all," replied lie. “
Yet there are many occasions, on which it is not proper to draw up an army, or to conduct it, in the same way." " But, by Jupiter, he gave me no ex­ planation as to such occasions."
"Go again, then, by all means," said Socrates, "and question him;
for if he knows, and is not quite shameless, he will blush, after taking your money, to send you away in ignorance.
"
A good general ought to take measures for the safety, maintenance, and success of his troops;
and not to study his own honour alone, but that of his whole army.
1.
HAVING met, on some occasion, a person who had been elected general, Socrates said to him, " Why is it, do you think, that Homer has styled Agamemnon Shepherd of the people ?'
Is it not for this reason, that as a shepherd must be careful that his sheep be safe, and have food, and the ob­ ject may be effected for which they are kept, so a general must take care that his soldiers be safe, and have provisions, and that the object be effected for which they serve ?
and they serve, no doubt, that they may increase their gratifiea.
tions by conquering the enemy.
2. Or why has he praised Agamemnon in the following manner, saying that he was Both characters, a good king, and an efficient warrior?
1
Does he not mean that he would not have been " an efficient warrior,” if he had fought courageously alone against the enemy, and if he had not been the cause of courage to his whole army ;
and that he would not have been " a good king," if lie had attended to his own subsistence only, and had not been the cause of comfort to those over whom he ruled ?
3. For a man is chosen king, not that he may take good care of himself, but that those who have chosen him may prosper by his means;
and all men, when they take the field, take it that their lives may be rendered as happy as possible, and choose generals that they may conduct them to the accomplishment of that object.
4. It is incumbent on the leader of an army, therefore, to carry into execution the views of those who have chosen him their leader.
Nor is it easy to find anything more honourable than such exertion, or more disgraceful than an opposite course of conduct.
"Thus considering what was the merit of a good leader, lie omitted other points in his character, and left only this, that he should render those whom he commanded happy.
The duty of a commander of cavalry is twofold, to improve the condition both of his men and his horses;
and not to leave the care of the horses to the troops, sect.
1-4. How he should train his men, and how he should be himself qualified to do so, 5-10.
He should acquire oratorical power, that he may incite his men to exertion, and fire them with the desire of glory, 11-15.1.
I REMEMBER that lie held a dialogue with a person who had been chosen Hipparch,1 to the following purport.
“Could you tell me, young man," said he, " with what object you de­ sired to be a Hipparch ?
It certainly was not for the sake of rid­ ing first among the cavalry ;
for the horse-archers are honoured with that dignity, as they ride even before the Hipparchs.” " You say the truth," said the youth. "
Nor was it, surely, for the sake of being noticed, for even madmen are noticed by everybody." " You say the truth in that respect also.”
2. But was it, then, that you expect to render the cavalry better, and present them in that condition to your country, and that, if there should be need for the services of cavalry, you hope, as their leader, to be the author of some advantage to the state ? " "I do hope so, certainly." “
And it will be truly honourable to you," continued Socrates, "if you are able to effect that object.
But the office, to which you have been chosen, takes charge of both the horses and riders ?” " It does so," said the young man.
3. " Come then, tell me this first of all, how you propose to render the horses better?"
“That,” replied the other, "I do not consider to be my business ;
for I think that each man, individually, must take care of his own horse."
4. " If, then," said Socrates, " sonic of the men should present their horses before you so diseased in the feet, so weak in the legs, or so feeble in body, and others theirs so ill-fed, that they could not follow you ;
others, theirs so unmanageable, that they would not remain where you posted them;
others, theirs so vicious that it would not be possible to post them at all;
what would he the use of sueh cavalry to you ?
Or how would you be able, at the head of them, to be of any service to your country ? " "
You admonish me well," said the youth, " and I will try to look to the horses as far as may be in my power."
5, " And will you not also endeavour," asked Socrates, "to make the riders better ?" "I will," said lie.
“You will first of all, then, make them more expert in mounting their horses." " I ought to do so;
for if any of them should fall off, they would thus be better prepared to recover themselves.”
6. “If, then," said Socrates, " you should be obliged to hazard an engagement, whether will you order your men to bring the enemy down to the level sand1 on which you have been accustomed to ride, or will you try to exercise them on such ground as that on which the enemy may show themselves ?" " The latter method will be the better," said the young man.
7. " Will you also take any care that the greatest possible number of your men may be able to hurl the dart on horse­ back ? " "
That will be better too," replied he. “
And have you considered how to whet the courage of your cavalry, since you intend to make them more courageous, and animate them against the enemy ?"
"If I have not yet considered," said he, " I will now try to do so."
8. “And have you at all considered how your cavalry may be induced to obey you ?
For without obedience you will have no profit either from horses or horsemen, spirited and valiant as they may be."
“You say the truth, Socrates," said he ;
“ but by what means can a leader most effectually induce them to obedience ? "
9. " You are doubtless aware that in all circumstances men most willingly obey those whom they consider most able to direct;
for in sickness patients obey him whom they think the best physician ;
on ship-board, the passengers obey him whom they think the best pilot, and in agriculture, people obey him whom they deem the best husbandman."
Unques­ tionably," said the young man.
“Is it not then likely," said Socrates, " that in horsemanship also, others will be most will­ ing to obey him who appears to know best what he ought to do ?" in. " If, therefore, Socrates, I should myself appear the best horseman among them, will that circumstance be sufficient to induce them to obey me ?” " If you convince them in addition," said Socrates. " that it is better and safer for them to obey you." " Ilow, then, shall I convince them of that?"
“With much more ease,” replied Socrates, “than if you had to convince them that bad things are better and more profitable than good."
11. " You mean," said the young man, “that a commander of cavalry, in addition to his other qualifications, should study to acquire some ability in speak­ ing." “
And did you think," asked Socrates, "that you would command cavalry by silence ?
Have you not reflected, that whatever excellent principles we have learned according to law,1 principles by which we know how to live, we learned all through the medium of speech;
and that whatever other valuable instruction any person acquires, he acquires it by means of speech likewise?
Do not those who teach best, use speech most;
and those who know the most important truths, discuss them with the greatest eloquence ?
12. Or have you not observed,2 that when a band of dancers and musicians is formed from this city, as that, for instance, which is sent to Delos,1 no one from any other quarter can compete with it;
and that in no other city is manly grace2 shown by num­ bers of people like that which is seen here ?"
"What you say is true," said he.
13. “ But it is not so much in sweet­ ness of voice, or in size and strength of body, that the Athe­ nians excel other people, as in ambition, which is the greatest incitement to whatever is honourable and noble.” " This also is true," said he.
14. “Do you not think, then.” said So­ crates, “that if any one should study to improve the cavarry here, the Athenians would excel other people in that depart­ ment also, (as well in the decoration of their arms and horses as in the good order of the men, and in boldly defying danger to encounter the enemy,) if they thought that by such means they would acquire praise and honour?"
“It is probable,” said the young man. "
Do not delay, therefore," added So­ crates, "but try to excite your men to those exertions by which you will both be benefited yourself, and your countrymen through your means."
I will assuredly try," replied he.
Nicomachides complaining that the Athenians had not chosen him general, though he was experienced in war, but Antisthenes, who had seen no military service, Socrates proceeds to show that Antisthenes, although he had never filled the office of commander, might have qualities to indicate that he would fill it with success.
I. SEEING Nicomaehides,3 one day, coming from the as­ sembly for the election of magistrates, he asked him, " Who have been chosen generals, Nicomachides?” “ Are not the Athenians the same as ever, Socrates?" lie replied;
"for they have not chosen me, who am worn out with serving on the list,1 both as captain and centurion,2 and with having re­ ceived so many wounds from the enemy, (he then drew aside his robe, and showed the scars of the wounds,) but have elected Antisthenes, who has never served in the heavy-armed infantry, nor done anything remarkable in the cavalry, and who indeed knows nothing, but how to get money."
2. " Is it not good, however, to know this," said Socrates, "since lie will then be able to get necessaries for the troops?" “
But merchants," replied Nicomachides, " are able to collect money ;
and yet would not, on that account, be capable of leading an army."
3. " Antisthenes, however,” continued Socrates, " is given to emulation, a quality necessary in a general.
Do you not know that whenever he has been chorus-manager3 lie has gained the superiority in all his choruses ?" " But, by Jupi­ ter," rejoined Nicomachides, “ there is nothing similar in managing a chorus and an army."
4. “ Yet Antisthenes,” said Socrates, “ though neither skilled in music nor in teach­ ing a chorus,4 was able to find out the best masters in these departments."
"In the army, accordingly," exclaimed Nico­ machides, “ he will find others to range his troops for him, and others to fight for him !”
5. " Well, then,” rejoined So­ crates, "if lie find out and select the best men in military affairs, as he has done in the conduct of his choruses, lie will probably attain superiority in this respect also;
and it is likely that he will be more willing to spend money for a vic­ tory in war on behalf of the whole state, than for a victory with a chorus in behalf of his single tribe.”5 6. Do you say, then, Socrates," said he, " that it is in the power of the same man to manage a chorus well, and to manage an army well?" " I say," said Socrates, "that over whatever a man may preside, he will, if he knows what he needs, and is able to provide it, be a good president, whether he have the direc­ lion of a chorus, a family, a city, or an army."
7. "By Jupiter, Socrates," cried Nicomachides, "I should never have expected to hear from you that good managers of a family would also be good generals."
" Come, then," proceeded So crates, " let us consider what are the duties of each of them, that we may understand whether they are the same, or are in any respect different."
" By all means," said he.
8. " Is it not, then, the duty of both," asked Socrates, " to render those under their command obedient and submissive to them?" "Unquestionably." "
Is it not also the duty of both to in­ trust various employments to such as are fitted to execute them?"
"That is also unquestionable."
"To punish the bad, and to honour the good, too, belongs, I think, to each of them." "Undoubtedly." a. "
And is it not honourable in both to render those under them well-disposed towards them?" " That also is certain." "
And do you think it for the interest of both to gain for themselves allies and auxiliaries or not?"
"It assuredly is for their interest."
"Is it not proper for both also to be careful of their resources?" "Assuredly." "
And is it not proper for both, therefore, to be attentive and industrious in their respective duties ?" to.
All these par­ ticulars," said Nicomachides, " are common alike to both ;
but it is not common to both to fight." " Yet both have doubtless enemies," rejoined Socrates. "
That is probably the case," said the other.
"Is it not for the interest of both to gain the superiority over those enemies?" 11. Certainly;
but to say nothing on that point, what, I ask, will skill in managing a household avail, if it be necessary to fight ?"
"It will doubtless, in that case, be of the greatest avail," said So­ crate.a ;
" for a good manager of a house, knowing that nothing is so advantageous or profitable as to get the better of your enemies when you contend with them, nothing so unprofitable and prejudicial as to be defeated, will zealously seek and pro­ vide everything that may conduce to victory, will carefully watch and guard against whatever tends to defeat, will vigor­ ously engage if he sees that his force is likely to conquer, and, what is not the least important point, will cautiously avoid en­ gaging if he find himself insufficiently prepared.
12. Do not therefore, Nicomachides," he added, "despise men skilful in managing a household;
for the conduct of private affairs differs from that of public concerns only in magnitude;
in other respects they are similar;
but what is most to be ob­ served, is, that neither of them are managed without men, and that private matters are not managed by one species of men, and public matters by another ;
for those who conduct public business make use of men not at all differing in nature from those whom the managers of private affairs employ ;
and those who know how to employ them, conduct either private or public affairs judiciously, while those who do not know, will cir in the management of both.
"Conversation of Socrates with Pericles the younger on the mannei in which the Athenians might be made to recover their ancient spirit and ambition.
They ought to be reminded of the deeds of their ancestors, sect.
1—12 ;
and to be taught that indolence has been the cause of their degeneracy, 13.
They oughttorevivethe institutions of their forefathers, or imitate those of the Lacedæmonians, 14 ;
and to pay great attention to military affairs, 15—25.
How the territory of Attica might be best secured against invasion, 26—28.I.
CONVERSING, on one occasion, with Pericles,1 the son of the great Pericles, Socrates said, “I have hopes, Pericles, that under your leadership the city will become more eminent and famous in military affairs, and will get the better of her ene­ mies."
“I wish, Socrates," said Pericles, " that what you say may happen ;
but how such effects are to be produced, I cannot understand.” " Are you willing, then," asked So- crates, " that we should have some conversation on these points, and consider how far there is a possibility of effecting what we desire.
”“I am quite willing," replied Pericles.
2. “Are you aware, then," said Socrates, “that the Athenians are not at all inferior in number to the Bœotians?” " I am,” said Pericles. "
And whether do you think that a greater number of efficient and well-formed men could be selected from the Bœotians, or from the Athenians?" " The Atheni­ ans do not appear to me to be inferior in this respect." "
And which of the two peoples do you consider to be more united among themselves?”
"I think that the Athenians are ;
for many of the Bœotians, being oppressed by the The­ bans, entertain hostile feelings towards them.
But at Athens I see nothing of the kind."
3. " But the Athenians are more­ over of all people most eager for honour and most friendly in disposition ;
qualities which most effectually impel men to face danger in the cause of glory and of their country."
"The Athenians are certainly not to be found fault with in these respects.”
“And assuredly there is no people that can boast of greater or more numerous exploits of their ancestors than the Athenians ;
a circumstance by which many are prompted and stimulated to cultivate manly courage and to become brave.
”4. “All that you say is true, Socrates, but you see that since the slaughter of the thousand occurred at Lebadeia under Tolmides,1 and that at Delium under Hippocrates,2 the reputation of the Athenians has suffered as far as regards the Bœotians, and the spirit of the Bœotians has been raised as far as regards the Athenians, so that the Bœotians, indeed, who formerly did not dare, even on their own soil, to meet the Athenians in the field without the aid of the Spartans and other Peloponnesians, now threaten to invade Attica tingle-handed ;
while the Athenians, who formerly, when the Bœotians were unsupported, ravaged Boeotia.
are afraid lest the Bœotians should lay waste Attica.
5. " I perceive, in­ deed,” said Socrates, "that such is the ease;
but the city seems to me now to be more favourably disposed for any good general;
for confidence produces in men earelessness, indo­ lence, and disobedience, but fear renders them more attentive, obedient, and orderly, 6. You may form a notion of this from people in a ship ;
for as long as they fear nothing, they are all in disorder, but as soon as they begin to dread a storm, or the approach of an enemy, they not only do everything that they are told to do, but are hushed in silence, waiting for the directions to be given, like a band of dancers.”
1 7. " Well then," said Pericles, “ if they would now, assuredly, obey, it would be time for us to discuss how we might incite them to struggle to regain their ancient spirit, glory, and happiness.”
8. "If then," said Socrates, “we wished them to claim property of which others were in possession, we should most effectively urge them to lay claim to it, if we proved that it belonged to their fathers, and was their rightful inheritance;
and since we wish that they should strive for pre-eminence in valour, we must show them that such pre- eminence was indisputably theirs of old, and that if they now exert themselves to recover it, they will be the most power­ ful of all people."
9. “How, then, can we convince them of this?” “I think that we may do so, if we remind them that they have heard that their most ancient forefathers, of whom we have any knowledge, were the bravest of men."
10. "Do you allude to the dispute between the gods, of which Cecrops, and his assessors had the decision on account of their valour ?" " I do allude to that, and to the education and birth of Erech- theus,1 and the war which occurred in his time witn the people of the whole adjoining continent,2 as well as that which was waged under the Heracleidæ against the Peloponnesians,3 and all the wars that were carried on under Theseus,4 in all of which they showed themselves the bravest people of their time;
11.
and also, if you please, to what their descendants have since done, who lived not long before our day, not only contending, with their own unassisted strength, against the lords of all Asia and of Europe, as far as Macedonia, (who inherited vast power and wealth from their ancestors, and who had themselves performed great achievements,) but also distinguishing themselves, in conjunction with the Pelopon­ nesians, both by land and sea.
They, doubtless, are cele­ brated as having far surpassed other men of their time.” " They are so," said Pericles.
12. In consequence, though many migrations occurred in Greece, they remained 5 in their own country;
and many, when contending for their rights, submitted their claims to their arbitration, while many others, also, when persecuted by more powerful people, sought refuge with them."
13.“I wonder, indeed, Socrates,” said Pericles, "how our city ever degenerated."
"I imagine," said So­ crates, "that as some other nations6 have grown indolent through excessive exaltation and power, so likewise the Athenians, after attaining great pre-eminence, grew neglect­ ful of themselves, and consequently became degenerate.”14. "By what means, then," said Pericles, "could they now recover their pristine dignity?"
"It appears to me," replied Socrates, “ not at all difficult to discover;
for I think that if they learn what were the practices of their ancestors, and observe them not less diligently than they, they will become not at all inferior to them ;
but if they do not take that course, yet, if they imitate those1 who are now at the head of Greece, adhere to their institutions, and attend to the same duties with diligence equal to theirs, they will stand not at all below them, and, if they use greater exertion, even above them." is. “ You intimate," returned Pericles, “ that honour and virtue are far away from our city ;
for when will the Athenians reverence their elders as the Spartans do, when they begin, even by their own fathers, to show disrespect for older men ?
Or when will they exercise themselves like them, when they not only are regardless of bodily vigour, but deride those who cultivate it.
16. Or when will they obey the magistrates like them, when they make it their pride to set them at nought?
Or when will they be of one mind like them, when, instead of acting in concert for their mutual in­ terests, they inflict injuries on one another, and envy one another more than they envy the rest of mankind ?
More than any other people, too, do they dispute in their private and public meetings;
they institute more law-suits against one another, and prefer thus to prey upon one another than to unite for their mutual benefit.
They conduct their public affairs as if they were those of a foreign state ;
2 they contend about the management of them, and rejoice, above all things, in having power to engage in such contests.
17. From such conduct much ignorance and baseness prevail in the republic, and much envy and mutual hatred are engendered in the breasts of the citizens ;
on which accounts I am constantly in the greatest fear lest some evil should happen to the state too great for it to bear." is.
Do not by any means suppose, Pericles," rejoined Socrates, " that the Athenians are thus disordered with an incurable depravity.
Do you not see how orderly they are in their naval proceedings, how precisely they obey the presidents in the gymnastic games, and how, in the arrangement of the choruses, they submit to the directions of their teachers in a way inferior to none?" if. " This is indeed surprising," said Pericles, "that men of that classI should obey those who are set over them, and that the in­ fantry and cavalry, who are thought to excel the ordinary citizens in worth and valour, should be the least obedient of all the people."
20. “ The council of the Areopagus, too," said Socrates, "is it not composed of men of approved cha­ racter ?”2 "Undoubtedly," replied Pericles. "
And do you know of any judges who decide causes, and conduct all their business, with more exact conformity to the laws, or with more honour and justice ?"
“I find no fault with them," said Pericles. “ We must not therefore despair," said Socrates, " as if we thought that the Athenians are not inclined to be lovers of order."
21. " Yet in military affairs,” observed Peri­ cles, "in which it is most requisite to act with prudence, and order, and obedience, they pay no regard to such duties."
"It may be so," returned Socrates, "for perhaps in military affairs men who are greatly deficient in knowledge have the command of them.
Do you not observe that of harp-players, choristers, dancers, wrestlers, or pancratiasts, no one ventures to assume the direction who has not the requisite knowledge for it, but that all, who take the lead in such matters, are able to show from whom they learned the arts in which they are masters ;
whereas the most of our generals undertake to com­ mand without previous study.
3 22. I do not however imagine you to be one of that sort;
for I am sensible that you can tell when you began to learn generalship not less certainly than when you began to learn wrestling.
I am sure, too, that you have learned, and keep in mind, many of your father's prin­ ciples of warfare, and that you have collected many others from every quarter whence it was possible to acquire any­ thing that would add to your skill as a commander.
23. I have no doubt that you take great care that you may not un­ awares be ignorant of anything conducive to generalship, and that, if you have ever found yourself deficient in any such matters, you have applied to persons experienced in them, sparing neither presents nor civilities, that you might learn from them what you did not know, and might render them efficient helpers to you."
21. " You make me well aware, Socrates," said Pericles, "that you do not say this from a belief that I have diligently attended to these matters, but from a wish to convince me that he who would be a general must attend to all such studies;
and I indeed agree with you in that opinion.
"25. “ Have you considered this also, Pericles," asked So­ crates, “ that on the frontier of our territories lie great moun­ tains,1 extending down to Boeotia, through which there lead into our country narrow and precipitous defiles ;
and that our country is girded by strong mountains,2 as it lies in the midst of them?”
"Certainly," said he.
26. “Have you heard, too, that the Mysians and Pisidians, who occupy extremely strong positions in the country of the Great King,3 and who arc lightly armed, are able to make descents on the king's territory, and do it great damage, while they themselves pre­ serve their liberty?"
"This, too, I have heard," said Peri­ cles, 27.
“And do you not think that the Athenians,” said Socrates, "if equipped with light arms while they are of an age for activity, and occupying the mountains that fence our country, might do great mischief to our enemies, and form a strong bulwark for the inhabitants of bur country?" “ I think, Socrates," said he, " that all these arrangements would be useful."
28. "If these plans, then." concluded Socrates, “appear satisfactory to you, endeavour my excellent friend, to act upon them ;
for whatsoever of them you carry into exe­ cution, it will be an honour to yourself and an advantage to the state;
and if you fail in the attempt for want of power, you will neither injure the state nor disgrace yourself.
"Socrates, by his usual process of interrogation, leads Glaucon, a young man who was extravagantly desirous of a post in the government, to confess that he was entirely destitute of the knowledge necessary for the office to which he aspired.
He then shows that, unless a ruler has acquired an exact knowledge of state affairs, he can do no good to his country or cre­ dit to himself.
1.
WHEN Glaucon,1 the son of Ariston, attempted to ha­ rangue the people, from a desire, though he was not yet twenty years of age,2 to have a share in the government of the state, no one of his relatives, or other friends, could prevent him from getting himself dragged down from the tribunal, and making himself ridiculous;
but Socrates, who had a friendly feeling towards him on account of Charmides3 the son of Glaucon, as well as on account of Plato,4 succeeded in prevailing on him, by his sole dissuasion, to relinquish his purpose.
2. Meeting him by chance, he first stopped him by addressing him as follows, that he might be willing to listen to him :
" Glaucon," said he, “ have you formed an intention to govern the stale for us ? "
"I have, Socrates," replied Glaucon. " By Jupiter," rejoined Socrates, "it is an hon­ ourable office, if any other among men be so ;
for it is certain that, if you attain your object, you will be able yourself to secure whatever you may desire, and will be in a condition to benefit your friends ;
you will raise your father's house, and increase the power of your country ;
you will be celebrated, first of all in your own city, and afterwards throughout Greece, and perhaps also, like Themistocles, among the Bar­ barians ;
and, wherever you may be, you will be an object of general admiration.”
3. Glaucon, hearing this, was highly elated, and cheerfully stayed to listen.
Socrates next pro­ ceeded to say, “But it is plain, Glaucon, that if you wish to be honoured, you must benefit the state." " Certainly," answered Glaucon. “
Then, in the name of the gods," said Socrates, “ do not hide from us how you intend to act, but inform us with what proceeding you will begin to benefit the state ?
" 4. But as Glaucon was silent, as if just considering how he should begin, Socrates said, " As, if you wished to aggran­ dize the family of a friend, you would endeavour to make it richer, tell me whether you will in like manner also endea­ vour to make the state richer ? " " Assuredly," said he.
5. " Would it then be richer, if its revenues were increased ? " "
That i3 at least probable," said Glaucon.
"Tell me then," proceeded Socrates, " from what the revenues of the state arise, and what is their amount;
for you have doubtless considered, in order that if any of them fall short, you may make up the deficiency, and that if any of them fail, you may procure fresh supplies." " These matters, by Jupiter," re­ plied Glaucon, “ I have not considered."
6. " Well then," said Socrates, "if you have omitted to consider this point, tell me at least the annual expenditure of the state ;
for you undoubtedly mean to retrench whatever is superfluous in it." “ Indeed," replied Glaucon, " I have not yet had time to turn my attention to that subject."
" We will therefore,” said Socrates, " put off making our state richer for the pre­ sent ;
for how is it possible for him who is ignorant of its expenditure and its income to manage those matters ?"
7. " But, Socrates," observed Glaucon, "it is possible to enrich the state at the expense of our enemies."
"Extremely possi­ ble indeed,” replied Socrates, "if we be stronger than they ;
but if we be weaker, we may lose all that we have.” "
What you say is true," said Glaucon.
a. “Accordingly,” said So­ crates, " lie who deliberates with whom lie shall go to war, ought to know the force both of his own country and of the enemy, so that, if that of his own country be superior to that of the enemy, he may advise it to enter upon the war, but, if inferior, may persuade it to be cautious of doing so." " You say rightly,” said Glaucon.
9. “In the first place, then," proceeded Socrates, " tell us the strength of the country by land and set, and next that of the enemy."
“But, by Jupiter," exclaimed Glaucon, "I should not be able to tell you on the moment, and at a word." "
Well, then, if you have it written down," said Socrates, "bring it, for I should be extremely glad to hear what it is."
“But to say the truth," replied Glaucon, " I have not yet written it down."
10. “We will therefore put off considering about war for the present," said Socrates, “for it is very likely that, on account of the magnitude of those subjects, and as you are just commencing your administration, you have not yet examined into them.
But to the defence of the country, I am quite sure that you have directed your attention, and that you know how many gar­ risons are in advantageous positions, and how many not so, what number of men would be sufficient to maintain them, and what number would be insufficient, and that you will advise your countrymen to make the garrisons in advantageous posi­ tions stronger, and to remove the useless ones." it.
"By Jove,” replied Glaucon, "I shall recommend them to remove them all, as they keep guard so negligently, that the property is secretly carried off out of the country.” "
Yet if we re­ move the garrisons," said Socrates, " do you not think that liberty will be given to anybody that pleases to pillage ?
But,” added he, “have you gone personally, and examined as to this fact, or how do you know that the garrisons conduct themselves with such negligence?"
"I form my conjec­ tures," said he. "
Well then," inquired Socrates, “shall we settle about these matters also, when we no longer rest upon conjecture, but have obtained certain knowledge ? " “Perhaps that," said Glaucon, "will be the better course." 12. " To the jilver mines, however," continued Socrates, "I know that you have not gone, so as to have the means of telling us why a small­ er revenue is derived from them than came in some time ago " " I have not gone thither," said he. "
Indeed the place,” saia Socrates, " is said to be unhealthy, so that, when it is neces­ sary to bring it under consideration, this will be a sufficient excuse for you." " You jest with me,”1 said Glaucon.
13. " I am sure, however," proceeded Socrates, " that you have not neglected to consider, but have calculated, how long the corn, which is produced in the country, will suffice to maintain the city, and how much it requires for the year, in order that the city may not suffer from scarcity2 unknown to you, but that, from your own knowledge, you may be able, by giving your advice concerning the necessaries of life, to support the city, and preserve it." " You propose a vast field for me," observed Glaucon, "if it will be necessary for me to attend to such subjects."
14. "Nevertheless," proceeded Socrates, “a man cannot order his house properly, unless he ascertains all that it requires, and takes care to supply it with everything ne­ cessary ;
but since the city consists of more than ten thousand houses, and since it is difficult to provide for so many at once, how is it that you have not tried to aid one first of all, sup­ pose that of your uncle,3 for it stands in need of help ?
If you be able to assist that one, you may proceed to assist more ;
but if you be unable to benefit one, how will you be able te benefit many ?
Just as it is plain that, if a man cannot carry the weight of a talent, he need not attempt to carry a greater weight."
15. " But I would improve my uncle’s house," said Glaucon, " if he would but be persuaded by me."
“And then," resumed Socrates, “when you cannot persuade your uncle, do you expect to make all the Athenians, together with your uncle, yield to your arguments ?
16. Take care, Glaucon, lest, while you are eager to acquire glory, you meet with the reverse of it.
Do you not see how dangerous it is for a person to speak of, or undertake, what he does not understand ?
Contemplate, among other men, such as you know to be cha­ factors that plainly talk of, and attempt to do, what thee' do not know, and consider whether they appear to you, by such conduct, to obtain more applause or censure, whether they seem to be more admired or despised ?
17. Contemplate, again, those who have some understanding of what they say and do, and you will find, I think, in all transactions, that such as are praised and admired are of the number of those who have most knowledge, and that those who incur censure and neglect are among those that have least.
is.
If therefore you desire to gain esteem and reputation in your country, endeavour to suc­ ceed in gaining a knowledge of what you wish to do;
for if, when you excel others in this qualification, you proceed to manage the affairs of the state, I shall not wonder if you very easily obtain what you desire.
"Socrates exhorts Charmides, a man of ability, and acquainted with public affairs, to take part in the government, that lie may not be charged with indolence, sect.
1—4. As Charmides distrusts his abilities for public speaking, Socrates encourages him by various observations, 5—9.I. OBSERVING that Charmides,1 the son of Glaucon,1 a man of worth, and of far more ability than those who then ruled the state, hesitated to address the people, or to take part in the government of the city, lie said to him, “ Tell me, Char mides, if any man, who was able to win the crown in the public games,2 and, by that means, to gain honour for himself, and make his birth-place more celebrated in Greece, should nevertheless refuse to become a combatant, what sort of per­ son would you consider him to be?"
"I should certainly think him indolent and wanting in spirit," replied Charmides.
2. “And if any one were able," continued Socrates, “by tak­ ing part in public affairs, to improve the condition of his country, and thus to attain honour for himself, but should yet shrink from doing so, might not lie be justly regarded as wanting in spirit?"
"Perhaps so," said Charmides;
"but why do you ask me that question?"
“Because,” replied So. crates, " I think that you yourself, though possessed of suffi­ cient ability, yet shrink from engaging even in those affairs in which it is your duty as a citizen to take a share."
3. " But in what transaction have you discovered my ability," said Charm ides, "that you bring this charge against me?" "
In those conferences," answered Socrates, “in which you meet those who are engaged in the government of the stale;
for when they consult you on any point, I observe that you give them excellent advice, and that, when they are in any way in the wrong, you offer judicious objections."
4. “But it is not the same thing, Socrates,” said lie, " to converse with people in private, and to try one’s powers at a public assem­ bly."
"Yet," said Socrates, "he that is able to count, can count with no less exactness before a multitude than alone, and those who can play the harp best in solitude are also the best performers on it in company."
5. " But do you not see," said Charmides, "that bashfulness and timidity arc naturally inherent in mankind, and affect us far more before a multitude than in private conversations?"
"But I am prompted to remind you," answered Socrates, "that while you neither feel bashfulness before the most intelligent, nor timid before the most powerful, it is in the presence of the most foolish and weak that you are ashamed to speak.
6. And is it the fullers among them, or the cobblers, or the carpenters, or the copper-smiths, or the ship-merchants,1 or those who barter in the market, and meditate what they may buy for little and sell for more, that you are ashamed to address ?
For it is of all such characters that the assembly is composed.
7. How then do you think that your conduct differs from that of a wrestler, who, being superior to well-practised opponents, should yet fear the unpractised?
For is not this the case with you, that mough you converse at your ease with those who have attained eminence in state affairs, and of whom some un­ dervalue you, and though you are far superior to many who make it their business to address the people, you yet shrink from uttering your sentiments before men who have never thought of political affairs, and who have shown no disrespect for your talents, from an apprehension that you may be laughed at?"
8. “And do not the people in the assembly," asked Charmides, "appear to you often to laugh at those who speak with great judgment?”
“Yes,” said Socrates, “and so do the other sort of people;
1 and therefore I wonder at yon, that you so easily silence one class of persons when they do so, and yet think that you shall not be able to deal with another?
9. Be not ignorant of yourself,2 my friend, and do not commit the error which the majority of men commit;
for most persons, though they are eager to look into the affairs of others, give no thought to the examination of their own.
Do not you, then, neglect this duty, but strive more and more to cultivate your own powers;
and do not be regardless of the affairs of your country, if any department of them can be im­ proved by your means;
for, if they are in a good condition, not only the rest of your countrymen, but your own friends and yourself, will reap the greatest benefit.
"Socrates meets the captious questions of Aristippus about goodness and beauty in such a manner as to show that nothing is good or bad in itself, but only with reference to some object, sect.
1—3;
and that nothing is beautiful or otherwise in itself, but that the beautiful must be considered with regard to the useful, 4—7.
His remarks ou buildings, to the same effect, 8—10.I. WHEN Aristippus attempted to confute Socrates, as he himself had previously3 been confuted by him, Socrates, wishing to benefit those who were with him, gave his an­ swers, not like those who are on their guard lest their words be perverted,1 but like those who are persuaded that they ought2 above all things to do what is right.
a.
What Aris­ tippus had asked him, was, ' whether he knew anything good, in order that if he should say any such thing as food, or drink, or money, or health, or strength, or courage, he might prove that it was sometimes an evil.
But Socrates, re­ flecting that if anything troubles us, we want something to relieve us from it, replied, as it seemed best to do,3 " Do you ask me whether I know anything good for a fever?"
3. “I do not."
“Anything good for soreness of the eyes ?” "No." “For hunger?" "No, nor for hunger either.”
“Well then," concluded Socrates, "if you ask me whether I know anything good that is good for nothing, I neither know any­ thing, nor wish to know.
”4. Aristippus again asking him if he knew anything beau­ tiful, lie replied, " Many things.” " Are they then," inquired Aristippus, "all like each other?"
“Some of them," an­ swered Socrates, “are as unlike one another as it is possible for them to be."
“How then," said he, “ can what is beau­ tiful be unlike what is beautiful?"
"Because, assuredly," replied Socrates, "one man, who is beautifully formed for wrestling, is unlike another who is beautifully formed for running ;
and a shield, which is beautifully formed for de­ fence, is as unlike as possible to a dart, which is beautifully formed for being forcibly and swiftly hurled.”
5. " You an­ swer me,” said Aristippus, “ in the same manner as when I asked you whether you knew anything good.” " And do you imagine," said Socrates, " that the good is one thing, and the beautiful another?
Do you not know that with reference to the same objects all things are both beautiful and good?
Virtue, for instance, is not good with regard to some things and beautiful with regard to others;
and persons, in the same way, are called beautiful and good with reference to the same objects;
and human bodies, too, with reference to the same objects, appear beautiful and good;
and in like manner all other things, whatever men use, are considered beautiful and good with reference to the objects for which they are service­ able."
6. “ Can a dung-basket, then," said Aristippus, "be a beautiful thing?" “ Yes, by Jupiter," returned Socrates, “ and a golden shield may be an ugly thing, if the one be beautifully formed for its particular uses, and the other ill formed?"
7. Do you say, then, that the same things may be both beautiful and ugly?”
“Yes, undoubtedly, and also that they may be good and bad ;
for oftentimes what is good for hunger is bad for a fever, and what is good for a fever is bad for hunger;
oftentimes what is beautiful in regard to run­ ning is the reverse in regard to wrestling, and what is beauti­ ful in regard to wrestling is the reverse in regard to running;
for whatever is good is also beautiful, in regard to purposes for which it is well adapted, and whatever is bad is the re­ verse of beautiful, in regard to purposes for which it is ill adapted.
"8. When Socrates said, too, that the same houses that were beautiful were also useful, he appeared to me to instruct us what sort of houses we ought to build.
He reasoned on the subject thus, “Should not he, who purposes to have a house such as it ought to be, contrive that it may be most pleasanr, and at the same time most useful, to live in?" 9. This being admitted, he said, “ Is it not then pleasant to have it cool in summer, and warm in winter?" "
When his hearers had as­ sented to this, he said, “In houses, then, that look to the south, does not the skin, in the winter, shine into the porticoes, while, in the summer, it passes over our heads, and above the roof, and casts a shade ?
If it is well, therefore, that houses should thus be made,1 ought we not to build the parts towards the south higher, that the sun in winter may not be shut out, and the parts toward the north lower, that the cold winds may not fall violently on them?2 10. To sum up the matter briefly, that would be the most pleasant and the most beauti­ ful residence, in which the owner, at all seasons, would find the most satisfactory retreat, and deposit what belongs to him with the greatest safety.
"Paintings, and coloured decorations of the walls,!
deprive its, he thought, of more pleasure than they give.
The most suitable ground for temples and altars,2 he said, Kühner contents himself with adducing, without any remark, the comment of Lange :
“
As far as the summer is concerned, the posi­ tion of a house (in Greece) need not be considered, whether it looks to the south or any other quarter of the heaven ;
for it must be shady in the hottest season of the year, when, indeed, the sun send.
down its rays almost perpendicularly, and makes a shade in what­ ever position the house may be.
(Umbrosa tamen sit fervidissimo anni tempore, sole nimirum radios suos rectis lineis deorsum mit­ tente, et in quovis domûs situ umbram efficiente.)
In building a house, (in Greece,) therefore, it is necessary to take thought only for the winter, that at that season of the year the house may be as warm as possible.
To effect this object, let one row of buildings (una domorum series) face the south, and the other the north, in such a way, that those looking towards the south may be higher than those 'ooking in the opposite direction ;
for thus the higher will enjoy the sun in winter, and the lower, facing the north, will be defended from the winds blowing from that quarter."
(The part near um­ brosa tamen sit seems to be defective, or incorrect in some way.)
But to me the text seems capable of explanation only on the suppo­ sition that Socrates is speaking with reference to the porticoes or colonnades merely, as we can easily conceive why he should recom­ mend porticoes towards the south to be made high, in order to admit the sun in winter, (the summer sun, as Lange remarks, being not at all regarded,) and those toward the north to be made low, in order to exclude in some degree the keen north winds.
Thus Columella, R. R. i. 6. 2, says, Ambulationes meridiano œquinoctiali subjectœ sint, ut hieme plurimum solis et œstate minimum recipiant:
a passage which Schneider says is not to be compared with this of Xenophon ;
but it might not be very difficult to prove the contrary.
was such as was most open to view, and least trodden by the public;
for that it was pleasant for people to pray as they looked on them, and pleasant to approach them in purity.
1Various definitions of fortitude, prudence and temperance, madness, envy, idleness, command, happiness, given by Socrates.
Fortitude is not equal in all men;
it may be increased by exercise, sect.
1—3. Prudence and temperance not distinct from each other, 4. Justice, as well as other vir­ tues, is wisdom, 5.
The opposite to prudence is madness ;
ignorance dis­ tinct from madness, 6, 7. Envy is uneasiness of mind at the contempla­ tion of the happiness of others, 8. Idleness is forbearance from useful occupation, 9. Command is exercised, not by those who bear the name, merely, of kings and rulers, but by those who know how to command, 10—13.
The best object of human life is to act well;
the difference be­ tween acting cell and acting fortunately, 14, 15.1.
BEIXG asked, again, whether Fortitude was a quality acquired by education, or bestowed by nature, " I think,” said he, " that as one body is by nature stronger for enduring toil than another body, so one mind may be by nature more courageous in meeting dangers than another mind ;
for I see that men who are brought up under the same laws and insti­ tutions differ greatly from each other in courage.
2. I am of opinion, however, that every natural disposition may be im­ proved, as to fortitude, by training and exercise;
for it is evident that the Scythians and Thracians would not dare tc take bucklers and spears and fight with the Lacedæmonians;
and it is certain that the Lacedæmonians would not like tc fight the Thracians with small shields and javelins, or the Scythians with bows.
3. In other thing, also, I see that men differ equally from one another by nature, and make great improvements by practice ;
from which it is evident that it concerns all, as well the naturally ingenious as the naturally dull, to learn and study those arts in which they de­ sire to become worthy of commendation.
"4. Prudence and Temperance1 he did not distinguish;
for he deemed that he who knew what was honourable and good, and how to practise it, and who knew what was dishonourable, and how to avoid it, was both prudent and temperate Being also asked whether he thought that those who knew what they ought to do, but did the contrary, were prudent and tem­ perate, he replied, " No more than I think the [openly] im­ prudent and intemperate to be so;
2 for I consider that all [prudent and temperate] persons choose from what is possible what they judge for their interest, and do it;
and I therefore deem those who do not act [thus] judiciously to be neither prudent nor temperate."5. He said, too, that justice, and every other virtue, was [a part of] prudence, for that everything just, and everything done agreeably to virtue, was honourable and good ;
that those who could discern those things, would never prefer anything else to them;
that those who could not discern them, would never be able to do them, but would even go wrong if they attempted to do them;
and that the prudent, accordingly, did what was honourable and good, but that the imprudent could not do it, but went wrong even if they at­ tempted to do it;
and that since, therefore, all just actions, and all actions that are honourable and good, are done in agreement with virtue, it is manifest that justice, and every other virtue, is [comprehended in] prudence.
6.
The opposite to prudence, lie said, was Madness ;
3 he did not, however, regard ignorance as madness;
though for a man to be ignorant of himself, and to fancy and believe that he knew what he did not know, he considered to be something closely bordering on madness.
The multitude, he observed, do not say that those are mad who make mistakes in matters of which most people are ignorant, but call those only mad who make mistakes in affairs with which most people are ac­ quainted ;
7.
for if a man should think himself so tall as to stoop when going through the gates in the city wall, or so strong as to try to lift up houses, or attempt anything else that is plainly impossible to all men, they say that he is mad;
but those who make mistakes in small matters are not thought by the multitude to be mad;
but just as they call strong desire" "love," so they call " great disorder of intellect " " madness."s.
Considering what Envy was, he decided it to be a cer­ tain uneasiness, not such as arises, however, at the ill success of friends, nor such as is felt at the good success of enemies, but those only he said were envious who were annoyed at the good success of their friends.
When some expressed sur­ prise, that any one who had a friendly feeling for another should feel uneasy at his good fortune, he reminded them that many are so disposed towards others as to be incapable of neglecting them if they are unfortunate, but would relieve them in ill fortune, though they are uneasy at their good for­ tune.
This feeling, he said, could never arise in the breast of a sensible man, but that the foolish were constantly af­ fected with it.a.
Considering what Idleness was, he said that he found most men did something;
for that dice-players and buffoons did something;
but he said that all such persons were idle, for it was in their power to go and do something better;
he ob­ served that a man was not idle, however, in passing from a better employment to a worse, but that, if he did so, he, as he [previously] had occupation, acted in that respect viciously.in.
Kings and Commanders, he said, were not those who held sceptres merely, or those elected by the multitude, or those who gained authority by lot, or those who attained it by violence or deceit, but those who knew how to command.
11. For when some one admitted that it was the part of a commander to enjoin what another should do, and the part of him who was commanded, to obey, he showed that in a ship the skilful man is the commander, and that the owner and all the other people in the ship were obedient to the man of knowledge;
that, in agriculture, those who had farms, in sickness, those who were ill, in bodily exercises, those who practised them, and indeed all other people, who had any business requiring care, personally took the management of it if they thought that they understood it, but if not, that they were not only ready to obey men of knowledge who were pre­ sent, but even sent for such as were absent, in order that, by yielding to their directions, they might do what was proper.
In spinning, too, he pointed out that women commanded men, as the one knew how to spin, and the other did not know.
12. But if any one remarked in reply to these observations, that a tyrant is at liberty not to obey judicious advisers, he would say, " And how is lie at liberty not to obey, when a penalty hangs over him that does not obey a wise monitor ?
for in whatever affair a person does not obey a prudent ad­ viser, he will doubtless err, and, by erring, will incur a penalty."
13. If any one also observed that a tyrant might put to death a wise counsellor, " And do you think," he would say, " that he who puts to death the best of his allies will go unpunished, or that he will be exposed only to casual punishment ?
Whether do you suppose that a man who acts thus would live in safety, or would be likely, rather, by such conduct, to bring immediate destruction on himself ?"14. When some one asked him what object of study he thought best for a man, he replied, " good conduct."
When he asked him again whether he thought "good fortune" an object of study, lie answered, "'Fortune' and 'Conduct'I think entirely opposed ;
for, for a person to light on anything that he wants without seeking it, I consider to be 'good for­ tune,' but to achieve anything successfully by learning and study, I regard as ' good conduct;
' and those who make this their object of study appear to me to do well.
"15.
The best men, and those most beloved by the gods, he observed, were those who, in agriculture, performed their agricultural duties well, those who, in medicine, performed their medical duties well, and those who, in political offices, performed their public duties well;
but he who did nothing well, he said, was neither useful for any purpose, nor accept­ able to the gods.
Socrates was desirous to benefit artisans by discoursing with them on the principles of their several arts.
Of painting, sect.
1. Of representing perfect beauty, 2. Of expressing the affections of the mind, 3—5.
Of statuary, 6—8.
In what the excellence of a corslet consists, 9—15.1.
WHENEVER he conversed with any of those who were engaged in arts or trades, and who wrought at them for gain, he proved of service to them.
Visiting Parrhasius1 the painter one day, and entering into conversation with him, he said, "Pray, Parrhasius, is not painting the representation of visi­ ble objects ?
At least you represent substances, imitating them by means of colour, whether they be concave or convex, dark or light, hard or soft, rough or smooth, fresh or old." "
What you say is true," said Parrhasius.
2. " And when you would represent beautiful figures, do you, since it is not easy to find one person with every part perfect, select, out of many, the most beautiful parts of each, and thus represent figures beautiful in every part ?" " We do so," said he.
3. " And do you also," said Socrates, "give imitations of the disposition of the mind, as it may be most persuasive, most agreeable, most friendly, most full of regret, or most amiable ?
Or is this inimitable ? " "
How can that be imitated, Socrates," said he, "which has neither proportion, nor colour, nor any of the qualities which you just now mentioned, and is not even a visible object ? " 1 4. "Is it not often observable in a man that he regards others with a friendly or unfriendly look ?" " I think so," said he. "
Is this then possible to be copied in the eyes ? " " Assuredly."
"And at the good or ill fortune of people's friends, do those who are affected at it, and those who are not, appear to you to have the same sort of look ? " "
No, indeed ;
for they look cheerful at their good, and sad at their evil, fortune. " "
Is it possible, then, to imitate these looks ?" "Unquestionably."
5. "Surely, also, nobleness and generosity of disposition, meanness and illiber­ ality, modesty and intelligence, insolence and stupidity, show themselves both in the looks and gestures of men, whether they stand or move." " What you say is just." " Can these peculiarities be imitated ? " " Certainly." " Whether, then," said Socrates, "do you think that people look with more plea­ sure on paintings in which beautiful, and good, and lovely characters are exhibited, or those in which the deformed, and evil, and detestable are represented ?"
"There is a very great difference indeed, Socrates," replied Parrhasius.2G.
Going once, too, into the workshop of Cleito,3 the statu­ ary, and beginning to converse with him, he said, " I see and understand, Cleito, that you make figures of various kinds, runners and wrestlers, pugilists and pancratiasts, but how do you put into your statues that which most wins the minds of the beholders through the eye, the life-like appearance ? "
7. As Cleito hesitated, and did not immediately answer, So­ crates proceeded to ask, "Do you make your statues appear more life-like by assimilating your work to the figures of the living ? "
"Certainly," said he. "
Do you not then make your figures appear more like reality, and more striking, by imitating the parts of the body, that are drawn up or drawn down, compressed or spread out, stretched or relaxed, by the gesture?" "Undoubtedly," said Cleito. "
And the repre­ sentation of the passions of men engaged in any act, does it not excite a certain pleasure in the spectators ? "
"It is na tural, at least, that it should be so," said he.
"Must you not, then, copy the menacing looks of combatants ?
And must you not imitate the countenance of conquerors, as they look joyful ?"
"Assuredly," said he.
"A statuary, therefore," concluded Socrates, "must express the workings of the mind by the form."9.
Entering the shop of Pistias,1 a corset-maker, and Pis­ tias having shown him some well-made corslets, Socrates ob­ served, " By Juno, Pistias, this is an excellent invention, that the corslet should cover2 those parts of a man's body that need protection, and yet should not hinder him from using his hands.
10. But tell me, Pistias," he added, "why do you sell your corslets at a higher price than other makers, though you neither make them stronger nor of more costly materials ?" " Because, Socrates," said he, " I make them better propor­ tioned." "
And do you make this proportion appear in the measure or weight of your corslets, that you set a higher price on them ?
For I suppose that you do not make them all equal or similar, if you make them to fit different persons."
"Indeed," replied he, " I do make them to fit, for there would be no use in a corslet without that quality."
11. Are not then," said Socrates, " the bodies of some men well-propor­ tioned, and those of others ill-proportioned ? " " Certainly," said Pistias. " How, then," asked Socrates, " do you make a well-proportioned corslet fit an ill-proportioned body ?"
"As I make it fit," answered Pistias ;
"for one that fits is well-proportioned."
12. " You seem to me," said Socrates, " to speak of proportion considered not independently, but with respect to the wearer, as if you should say of a shield, or a cloak, that it is well-proportioned to him whom it suits;
and such appears to be the case with regard to other things, according to what you say.
is.
But, perhaps, there may be some other considerable advantage attendant on being made to fit." " Tell me, Socrates," said he, " if you know any."
"Those corslets which fit," answered Socrates, "are less oppressive by their weight, than those which do not fit, though they be both of equal weight;
while those which do not fit, are, either from hanging wholly on the shoulders, or from pressing heavily on some other part of the body, inconvenient and uneasy;
but those which fit, as they distribute their weight partly over the collar-bone1 and shoulder, partly over the upper part of the arm, and partly over the breast, back, and stomach, appear almost like, not a burden to be borne, but a natural appendage."
14. " You have hit upon the very quality," said Pistias, "for which I consider my manufacture deserving of the very highest price;
some, however, prefer purchasing ornamented and gilded corslets." "
Yet if on this account," said Socrates, " they purchase such as do not fit, they appear to me to purchase an ornamented and gilded annoyance.
But," added he, " since the body does not continue always in the same position, but is at one time bent, and at another straight, how can a corslet, which is exactly fitted to it, suit it ?" " It cannot by any means," said Pistias. " You mean, therefore," said Socrates, " that it is not those which are exactly fitted to the body that suit, but those that do not gall in the wearing." " You say what is clearly the case, Socrates," replied he, " and exactly comprehend the matter.

THERE being at one time a beautiful woman in the city, whose name was Theodota,2 a woman ready to form a con- nexion with any one that made advances to her, and some­ body in company with Socrates making mention of her, and saying that her beauty was beyond description, and that painters went to her to take her portrait, to whom she showed as much of her person as she could with propriety, " We ought then to go and see her," remarked Socrates, " for it is not possible to comprehend by hearing that which surpasses description." " You cannot be too quick in following me, then," said he who had mentioned her.
2.
Going, accordingly, to the house of Theodota, and find­ ing her standing to a painter, they contemplated her figure;
and when the painter had left off, Socrates said, " My friends, whether ought we to feel obliged to Theodota for having shown us her beauty, or she to us for having viewed it with admiration ?
If the exhibition be rather of advantage to her, ought not she to feel grateful to us, or if the sight has given rather more pleasure to us, ought not we to feel grateful to her ?"
3. Somebody saying that he spoke reasonably, he added, " She. then, for the present, gains praise from us, and, when we have spoken of her to others, will gain profit in addition ;
but as for us, we now desire to embrace what we have seen, and shall go away excited, and long for her after we are away from her ;
the natural consequence of which is that we shall be her adorers, and that she will be worshipped as our mistress."
"If this be the case, indeed," said Theodota, "I must feel gratitude to you for coming to see me.
"4. Soon after, Socrates, seeing her most expensively attired, and her mother with her in a dress and adornment above the common, with several handsome female attendants, not unbecomingly apparelled, and her house richly furnished in other respects, said to her, " Tell me, Theodota, have you an estate?"
"Not I indeed," replied site. "
But perhaps you have a house that brings you an income?" " Nor a house either," said she. "
Have you then any slaves that practise handicrafts?"1 "No, nor any slaves."
"How then," said Socrates, "do you procure subsistence ?
"If any one be­ comes my friend," she replied, "and is willing to benefit me, lie is my means of subsistence."
5. "By Juno, Theodota," rejoined Socrates, "and he is an excellent acquisition to you ;
and it is much better to have a flock of friends than of sheep, oxen, and goats, But," added lie, " do you leave it to chance whether a friend, like a fly, shall wing his way to you, or do you use any contrivance to attract them ?"
6. "And how," said she, "can I find a contrivance for such a purpose?" "
Much more readily," said he, " than spiders can ;
for you know how they try to get subsistence ;
they weave fine nets, and feed upon whatever falls into them."
7. "And do you ad­ vise me, too," said she, " to weave a net ?" "
Yes," said he, " for you ought not to think that you will catch friends, the most valuable prey that can be taken, without art.
Do you not see how many arts hunters use to catch hares,1 an animal of but little worth ?
8, As the hares feed in the night, they procure dogs for hunting by night, with which they chase them ;
as they conceal themselves in the day, they pro­ vide other dogs, which, perceiving by the smell the way that they have gone from their feeding-place to their forms, trace them out;
and as they arc swift of foot, so as soon to escape from view by running, they procure also other dogs, of great speed, that they may be caught by pursuit;
and because some of them escape even from these dogs, they stretch nets across the paths by which they flee, that they may fall into them and be entangled."
9. " By what art of this kind, then," said she, " can I catch friends ?" " If," said he, " instead of a dog, you get somebody to track and discover the lovers of beauty, and the wealthy, and who, when lie has found them, will contrive to drive them into your nets." " And what nets have I ?" said site.
to. "
You have one at least," he replied, " and one that closely embraces its prey, your person ;
and in it you have a mind, by which you understand how you may gratify a person by looking at him, and what you may say to cheer him, and learn that you ought to receive with transport him who shows concern for you, and to shut out him who is insolent, to attend carefully on a friend when he is ill, to re­ joice greatly with him when he has succeeded in anything hon­ ourable, and to cherish affection in your whole soul for the man who sincerely cares for you.
To love I am sure that you know, not only tenderly, but with true kindness of heart;
and your friends try to please you, I know, because you conciliate them, not with words merely, but by your behaviour towards them." " Indeed," replied Theodota, " I use none of these schemes."
11." Yet," said Socrates, " it is of great importance to deal with a man according to his disposition, and with judgment;
for by force you can neither gain nor keep a friend, but by serving and pleasing him the animal1 is easily taken and attached to you."
" What you say is true," said she.12. " It becomes you, therefore," proceeded Socrates, " in the first place, to request of your lovers only such favours as they will perform with least cost to themselves;
and you must then make a return by obliging them in a similar way;
;
2 for thus they will become most sincerely attached to you, and will love you longest, and benefit you most.
13. But you will please them most, if you grant them favours only when they solicit them ;
for you see that even the most savoury meats, if a person offer them to another before he has an appetite for them, appear to him distasteful;
and in the satisfied they ex­ cite even loathing;
but if one offers food to another after having raised an appetite in him, it seems, though it be of a very ordinary kind, extremely agreeable."
14. "How then can I," said she, "excite such an appetite in any one of those that visit me ? " "
If, when they are satiated," said he, " you, in the first place, neither offer yourself to them, nor remind them of you, until, coming to an end of their satiety, they again feel a desire for you;
and, when they do feel such de­ sire, remind them of your fondness by the most modest ad­ dress, and by showing yourself willing to gratify them, hold­ ing back, at the same time, until they are filled with impatient longing';
for it is far better to grant the same favours at such a time, than before they had an appetite for them."
15. "Why do not you, then, Socrates," said she, "become my helper in securing friends ? " "I will indeed," said he, " if you can persuade me."
"And how then," said she, "can I persuade you ?" "You yourself will seek and find means to do so, if you should at all need me." " Come often to see me, then," said she.
16. Then Socrates, joking upon his own easy life, said, "But, Theodota, it is not easy for me to find leisure ;
for my own numerous occupations, private and public,1 allow me no rest;
and I have friends2 also, who will not suffer me to leave them day or night, learning from me love-charms and incantations."
IT.
Do you then know such arts, too, So­ crates ? " said Theodota. "
Through what other influence do you suppose that Apollodorus3 here, and Antisthenes,4 never leave me?
and through what other influence do you suppose that Cebes5 and Simmias5 come to me from Thebes?
Be assured, that such effects were not produced without many love-charms, incantations, and magic wheels."
6 Is.
Lend me, then, your magic wheel," said site, " that I may set it a going," first of all, against yourself." " But, by Jupiter," ex­ claimed Socrates, " I do not wish that I should be drawn to you, but that you should come to me."
"I will come then," said she, "only take care to let me in." " I will let you in replied he, " if another more acceptable than you be not within."
8Socrates shows the benefit of gymnastic exercises, as well on the health of the mind as on that of the body, sect.
1—4. The advantages of health and vigour, 5—8.1.
NOTICING that Epigenes, one of his followers, was both very young and weak in body, he said to him, " How very unlike an athlete1 you are in frame, Epigenes ! "
"I am not an athlete, Socrates," replied he.
"You are not less of an ath­ lete," rejoined Socrates, " than those who are going to con­ tend at the Olympic games.
Does the struggle for life with the enemy, which the Athenians will demand of you when circumstances require, seem to you to be a trifling contest ?
a.
Yet, in the dangers of war, not a few, through weakness of body, either lose their lives, or save them with dishonour ;
many, from the same cause, arc taken alive, and, as prisoners of war, endure for the rest of their lives, if such should be their fate, the bitterest slavery;
or, falling into the most grievous hardships, and paying for their ransom sometimes more than they possess, pass the remainder of their existence in want of necessaries, and in the endurance of affliction ;
and many, too, incur infamy, being thought to be cowards merely from the imbecility of their bodily frame.
3. Do you think lightly of such penalties attached to weakness of body, or do you expect that you will endure such calamities with ease ?
I believe that what lie must bear who attends to the health of his body, is far lighter and more pleasant than such afflic­ tions.
Or do you suppose that an ill condition of body is more salutary and advantageous than a good condition ?
Or do you despise the benefits secured by a good state of the body?
4. Yet the lot which falls to those who have their bodies in good condition is exactly the reverse of that which falls to those who have them in ill condition ;
for those who have their bodies in a good state are healthy and strong;
and many, from being possessed of this advantage, save themselves with honour amid the struggles of war, and escape every peril;
many, also, assist their friends and benefit their coun­ try, and, for such services, are thought worthy of favour, ac­ quire great glory, and attain the highest dignities ;
and, on these accounts, pass the rest of their lives with greater plea­ sure and honour, and bequeath finer fortunes1 to their chil­ dren.
5. Nor, because the city does not require warlike exercises publicly,2 ought we, on that account, to neglect them privately, but rather to practise them the marc;
3 for be well assured that neither in any other contest, nor in any affair whatever, will you at all come off the worse because your body is better trained than that of other men ;
since the body must bear its part in whatever men do ;
and in all the services required from the body, it is of the utmost import­ ance to have it in the best possible condition ;
6.
for even in that in which you think that there is least exercise for the body, namely, thinking, who does not know that many fail greatly from ill-health ?
and loss of memory, despondency, irritability, and madness, often, from ill-health of body, at­ tack the mind with such force as to drive out all previous knowledge.
7. But to those who have their bodies in good condition, there is the utmost freedom from anxiety, and no danger of suffering any such calamity from weakness of con­ stitution;
whilst it is likely, rather, that a healthy state of body will avail to produce consequences the reverse of those which result from an unhealthy state of it;
and, indeed, to secure consequences the reverse of what we have stated, what would a man in his senses not undergo?
8. It is disgraceful, too, for a person to grow old in self-neglect, before he knows what he would become by rendering himself well-formed and vigorous in body;
but this a man who negleets himself can­ not know;
for such advantages are not wont to come spon­ taneously.
Several brief sayings of Socrates.
We should not be offended at rudeness of manner more than at personal defects, sect.
1. Fasting the best remedy for loathing of food, 2. We should not be too nice as to food or drink, 3. He that punishes his slave, should consider whether he himself deserves like punishment, 4. Admonitions to travellers, 5.
It is disgraceful to him who has been trained in the gymnasium to be outdone by a slave in enduring toil, 6.I.
A PERSON being angry, because, on saluting another, lie was not saluted in return, " It is an odd thing," said Socrates to turn, " that if you had met a man in-conditioned in body, you would not have been angry, but to have met a man rudely disposed in mind provokes you."a.
Another person saying that he ate without pleasure, " Acumenus,”1 said Socrates, ‟ prescribes an excellent remedy for that disease.
”The other asking, ‟What sort of remedy?” " To abstain from eating,” said Socrates ;
" for he says that, after abstaining, you will live with more pleasure, less ex­ pense, and better health.”3. Another saying that the water which lie had to drink at his house was warm, ‟When you wish to bathe in warm water, then,” said Socrates, " it will be ready for you."
"But it is too cold to bathe in," said the other. ‟
Are your slaves, then," asked Socrates, ‟ inconvenienced by drinking or bathing in it?" ‟ No, by Jupiter," replied he;
"for I have often wondered how cheerfully they use it for both those purposes.” ‟
And is the water in your house,” said Socrates, ‟or that in the temple of Æsculapius,2 the warmer for drink­ ing?"
"That at the temple of Æsculapius,” replied he. "
And which is the colder for bathing in, that at your house, or that in the temple of Amphiaraus ?"3 ‟ That in the temple of Amphiaraus,” said he. " Consider, then," said Socrates, " that you seem to be harder to please than your slaves or the sick."4. Another person beating his attendant severely, Socrates asked him why he was so angry at the slave.
"Because," said he, ‟ he is very gluttonous and very stupid, very covet­ ous and very idle." ‟
And have you ever reflected," rejoined Socrates, "which of the two deserves the greater number of stripes, you or your slave?"5. A person being afraid of the journey to Olympia, "Why," said Socrates to him, " do you fear the journey ?
Do you not walk about at nome almost all day ?
And, if you set out thither, you will walk and dine, walk and sup, and go to rest.
Do you not know that if you were to extend in a straight ':
ne the walks which you take in five or six days, you would easily go from Athens to Olympia ?
But it will be better for you to start a day too soon than a day too late;
for to be obliged to extend your days' journeys beyond a moderate length is disagreeable;
but to spend one day more on the road gives great ease;
and it is better, therefore, to hasten to start than to hurry on the way.
"6. Another saying that he was utterly wearied with a long journey, Socrates asked him whether he carried any burden.
"
No, by Jupiter," said he, ‟ I did not, except my cloak." "
And did you travel alone," said Socrates, " or did an at­ tendant accompany you?"
"An attendant was with me." " Was he empty-handed, or did he carry anything?" " He carried, certainly, the bedding3 and other utensils."
‟And how did he get over the journey?" ‟
He appeared to me to come off better than myself."
"If you, then, had been obliged to carry his burden, how do you imagine that you would have fared?”
"Very ill," by Jupiter;
"or rather, I should not have been able to carry it at all." ‟
And how can you think that it becomes a man trained to exercise to be so much less able to bear fatigue than a slave?"fable-talk of Socrates in praise of frugality.
In contributions to feasts, one guest should not strive to surpass another in the quality or quantity of what he contributes, sect.
1. lie may be called ὀψοφάγος, flesh-cater, who cats flesh alone, or with very little bread, 2—4.
He that cats of many dishes at once acts foolishly in various ways, 6, 6. lie may be truly said to banquet, who lives on plain and wholesome food, 7.1.
WHEN, among a number of persons who had met to­ gether to sup, some brought little meat, and others a great quantity, Socrates desired the attendant either to set the smallest dish on the table for common participation, or to dis­ tribute a portion of it to each.
They, accordingly, who had brought a great deal, were ashamed not to partake of what was put on table for the company in general, and not, at the same time, to put their own on table in return.
They therefore offered their own dishes for the participation of the company;
and when they had no greater share than those who brought but little, they ceased to buy meat at great cost.
2.
Observing one of those at table with him taking no bread, but eating meat by itself, and a discussion having arisen at the same time about names, for what cause any par ticular name was given, ‟Can we tell,” said Socrates, "for what cause a man should be called ὀψοφúγος ?1 For everybody eats flesh with his bread when he has it;
but I do not sup­ pose that people are called ὀψοφάγοι on that account.” ‟ I should think not,” said one of the company.
3. ‟ But,” said Socrates, " if a person should eat meat by itself without bread, not for the purpose of training,2 but of gratifying his appetite, whether would he seem to be an ὀψοφάγος or not?" " Scarcely any other would more justly seem so," said he ‟And he that eats a great deal of meat with very little bread,” said another of the company, ‟what should lie be calle ?” "To me,” replied Socrates, ‟it appears that he would justly be called ὀψοφάγος, and when other men pray to the gods for abundance of corn, lie may pray for abundance of fles.”
4. When Socrates said this, the young man, thinking that the words were directed at him, did not indeed leave off eating meat, but took some bread with it.
Socrates, observ­ ing him do so, said, "Notice this young man, you that sit near him, whether he takes bread to his meat, or meat to his bread."5. Seeing another of the company taste of several dishes with the same piece of bread, " Can any cookery be more ex­ travagant,” said he, “or more adapted to spoil dishes, than that which he practises who eats of several at the same time, putting all manner of sauces into his mouth at once ?
For as he mixes together more ingredients than the cooks, he makes what he eats more expensive;
and as he mixes what they for­ bear to mix as being incongruous, he, if they do right, is in the wrong, and renders their art ineffectual.
6. And how can it be otherwise than ridiculous," he added, " for a man to pro­ vide himself with cooks of the greatest skill, and then, though he pretends to no knowledge of their art, to undo what has been done by them ?
But there is another evil attendant on him who is accustomed to eat of several dishes at once;
for, if lie has not several sorts of meat before him, he thinks himself stinted, missing the variety to which he has been used.
But he who is accustomed to make one piece of bread, and one piece of meat, go together, will be able to partake contentedly of one dish when several are just at hand.
"7. He observed also that εὐωχει̃ϭϑαι, " to fare wen,”1 was in the language of the Athenians called ἐϭϑίειν, "to eat;
" and that the εὖ, " well," was added to denote that we should eat such food as would disorder neither mind nor body, and such as would not be difficult to be procured ;
so that he applied εὐωχει̃ϭϑαι, "to fare well," to those who fared temperately.
Socrates liked the society of young men;
how he judged of them;
his de­ sire that they should be well educated, sect.
1, 2. The more powerful the mind in youth, the more likely it is, if ill trained, to run into viee, 3, 4.
Happiness does not depend on riches, but on knowledge, and on being useful to our fellow-ereatures, and gaining their esteem, 5.1.
So serviceable was Socrates to others, in every kind of transaction, and by every possible means, that to any one who reflects on his usefulness, (even though he possess but moderate discernment,) it is manifest that nothing was of greater be­ nefit than to associate with Socrates, and to converse with him, on any occasion, or on any subject whatever;
since even the remembrance of him, when he is no longer with us, bene­ fits in no small degree those who were accustomed to enjoy his society, and heard him with approbation;
for he sought to improve his associates not less in his humorous than in his serious conversation.
a.
He would often say that he loved some particular person ;
but he was evidently enamoured, not of those formed by nature to be beautiful, but of those naturally inclined to virtue.
He judged of the goodness of people's abilities from their quickness in learning the things to which they gave their attention, from their re­ membrance of what they learned, and from their desire for all those branches of knowledge by means of which it is possi­ ble to manage a family or an estate well, and to govern men and their affairs with success ;
for he thought that such cha­ racters, when instructed, would not only be happy themselves, and regulate their own families judiciously, but would be able to render other men, and other communities besides their own, happy.
3. He did not however make advances to all in the same manner.
Those who thought that they had good natural abilities, but despised instruction, he endeavoured to con­ vince that minds which show most natural power have most need of education, pointing out to them that horses of the best breed, which are high-spirited and obstinate, become, if they are broken in when young, most useful and valuable, but if they are left unbroken, remain quite unmanageable and worthless ;
and that hounds of the best blood, able to endure toil, and eager to attack beasts, prove, if they are well trained, most serviceable for the chase, and every way excellent, but, if untrained, are useless, rabid, and disobedient.
4. In like manner, he showed that men of the best natural endowments, possessed of the greatest strength of mind, and most energetic in executing what they undertake, became, if well disciplined and instructed in what they ought to do, most estimable cha­ racters, and most beneficent to society, (as they then per­ formed most numerous and important services,) but that, if uninstructed, and left in ignorance, they proved utterly worth­ less and mischievous ;
for that, not knowing what line of conduct they ought to pursue, they often entered upon evil courses, and, being haughty and impetuous, were difficult to be restrained or turned from their purpose, and thus occasioned very many and great evils.
5.
But those who prided themselves on their wealth, and thought that they required no education, but imagined that their riches would suflice to effect whatever they desired, and to gain them honour from mankind, he tried to reduce to reason by saying that the man was a fool who thought that he could distinguish the good and the evil in life without in­ struction ;
and that he also was a fool, who, though he could not distinguish them, thought that he would procure whatever he wished, and effect whatever was for his interest, by means of his wealth.
He also said that the man was void of sense, who, not being qualified to pursue what was for his good, fancied that he would be prosperous in the world, and that everything necessary for his comfort was fully, or at least sufficiently, provided for him ;
and that he was equally void of sense, who, though he knew nothing, thought that he would seem good for something because of his riches, and, though evidently despicable, would gain esteem through their in­ fluence.
No dependence to be placed on natural abilities without education.
Socrates proceeds to show Euthydemus, a self-conceited young man, that in every art it is proper to have recourse to instructors, sect.

Further instructions given to Euthydemus, 30—40.1.
1
I will now show how Socrates addressed himself to such as thought that they had attained the highest degree of knowledge, and prided themselves on their ability.
Hearing that Euthydemus,2 surnamed the Handsome, had collected many writings3 of tIle most celebrated poets and sophists, and imagined that by that means he was outstripping his con­ temporaries in accomplishments, and had great hopes that he would excel them all in talent for speaking and acting, and finding, by his first inquiries about him, that he had not yet engaged in public affairs on account of his youth,4 but that, when he wished to do any business,5 he usually sat in a bridle- maker's shop near the Forum, he went himself to it, accom­ panied by some of his hearers;
2. and as somebody asked, first of all, " whether it was from his intercourse with some of the wise men, or from his own natural talents, that The­ mistocles attained such a pre-eminence above his fellow- citizens, that the republic looked to him whenever it wanted the service of a man of ability," Socrates, wishing to excite the attention of Euthydemus, said that "it was absurd to believe that men could not become skilled in the lowest mechanical arts without competent instructors, and to imagine that ability to govern a state, the most important of all arts, might spring up in men by the unassisted efforts of nature."3. Oil another occasion, when Euthydemus was one of tile company, and Socrates saw him leaving it, from apprehension lest lie should seem to admire him for his wisdom, he observed, "It is evident, my friends, from the studies that he pursues, that Euthydemus here, when lie comes of age, and the govern­ ment give liberty of discussion1 on any point, will not refrain from offering his counsel;
and I imagine that lie has already framed an exordium for his public oration, taking precau­ tion that lie may not be thought to have learned anything from anybody;
and it is pretty certain, therefore, that when he begins to speak, he will make his opening thus:
4. ' I, 0 men of Athens, have never learned anything from any per­ son, nor, though I heard of some that were skilled in speaking and acting, have I sought to converse with them;
nor have I been anxious that anyone of the learnedshould become my mas­ ter ;
but I have done the exact contrary;
for I have constant­ ly avoided not only learning anything from any one, but even the appearance of learning anything;
nevertheless I will offer you such advice as may occur to me without premeditation.
5. So it might be proper for a person to commence a speech who desired to obtain a medical appointment2 from the go­ vernment :
'
I, 0 men of Athens, have never learned the medical art from any one, nor have been desirous that any physician should be my instructor ;
for I have constantly been on my guard, not only against learning anything of the art from any one, but even against appearing to have learned any­ thing ;
nevertheless confer on me this medical appointment;
for I will endeavour to learn by making experiments3 upon you.'"
At this mode of opening a speech all who were pre­ sent burst out into laughter.
6.
As Euthydemus had now evidently begun to attend to what Socrates was saying, but was cautious of speaking him­ self, as thinking by his silence to clothe himself with reputa­ tion for modesty, Socrates, wishing to cure him of that fancy, said, “ It is indeed strange, that those who desire to play on the lyre, or on the flute, or to ride, or to become expert in any such accomplishment, should endeavour to practise, as constantly as possible, that in which they desire to excel, and not by themselves merely, but with the aid of such as are considered eminent in those attainments, attempting and undergoing every­ thing, so as to do nothing without their sanction, as supposing that they can by no other means attain reputation;
but that of those who wish to become able to speak and act in affairs of government, some think that they will be suddenly qualified to achieve their object, without preparation or study, and by their own unassisted efforts.
7. Yet these pursuits are mani­ festly more difficult of attainment than those, inasmuch as of the very many who attempt them a much smaller number succeed in them ;
and it is evident, therefore, that those who pursue the one are required to submit to longer and more dili­ gent study than those who pursue the other."
8. Socrates used at first to make such remarks, while Eu­ thydemus merely listened;
but when he observed that he stayed, while lie conversed, with more willingness, and hearkened to him with more attention, he at last came to the bridle-maker's shop unattended.
As Euthydemus sat down beside him, he said, " Tell me, Euthydemus, have you really, as I hear, collected many of the writings1 of men who are said to have been wise." " I have indeed, Socrates," replied he, "and I am still collecting, intending to persevere till I get as many as I possibly can."
9. By Juno," rejoined Socrates, "I feel admiration for you, because you have not preferred ac­ quiring treasures of silver and gold rather than of wisdom ;
for it is plain you consider that silver and gold are unable to make men better, but that the thoughts of wise men enrich their possessors with virtue."
Euthydemus was delighted to hear this commendation, believing that lie was thought by Socrates to have sought wisdom in the right course.
10. Socrates, ob­ serving that he was gratified with the praise, said, " And in what particular art do you wish to become skilful, that you collect these writings?"
As Euthydemus continued silent, considering what reply he should make, Socrates again asked, “ Do you wish to become a physician ?
for there are many writings of physicians."
" Not I, by Jupiter," replied Eu­ thydemus.
"Do you wish to become an architect, then?
for a man of knowledge is needed for that art also.
”1 " No, in­ deed," answered he.
“
Do you wish to become a good geome­ trician, like Theodorus?”2 "Nor a geometrician either,” said he.
"Do you wish then to become an astronomer?" said Socrates.
As Euthydemus said “ No," to this, “ Do you wish then," added Socrates, " to become a rhapsodist,3 for they say that you are in possession of all the poems of Homer."
"No indeed," said he, "for I know that the rhapsodists, though eminently knowing in the poems of Homer, are, as men, extremely foolish."
11. " You are perhaps desirous then,” proceeded Socrates, " of attaining that talent by which men become skilled in governing states, in managing households, able to command, and qualified to benefit other men as well as themselves." “ I indeed greatly desire," said he, “ Socra­ tes, to acquire that talent."
“ By Jupiter," returned Socrates, "you aspire to a most honourable accomplishment, and a most exalted art, for it is the art of kings, and is called the royal art.
But," added he, “ have you ever considered whether it is possible for a man who is not just to be eminent in that art ?" "
I have certainly,” replied he ;
" and it is not possible for a man to be even a good citizen without justice.,, 12. “ Have you yourself, then, made yourself master of that virtue ?" " I think," said he, " Socrates, that I shall be found not less just than any other man.”
“Are there then works of just men, as there are works of artisans ?" "
There are, doubtless,” replied he. “ Then,” said Socrates, “as arti­ sans are able to show their works, would not just men be able also to tell their works?"
"And why should not I," asked Euthydemus, "be able to tell the works of jus­ tice;
as also indeed those of injustice;
for we may see and hear of no small number of them every day?
"13. “ Are you willing then," said Socrates, “ that we should make a delta on this side, and an alpha3 on that, and then that we should put whatever seems to us to be a work of justice under the delta, and whatever seems to be a work of injustice under the alpha?”
"If you think that we need those letters,” said Euthydemus, "make them."
14. Socrates, having made the letters as he proposed, asked, “ Does false­ hood then exist among mankind?"
"It does assuredly," replied he.
"Under which head shall we place it?" "Under injustice, certainly."
"Does deceit also exist?” "Unques­ tionably." " Under which head shall we place that?"
“Evi dently under injustice.” “Docs mischievousness exist?" “Undoubtedly.”
"And the enslaving of men?" “That, too, prevails."
“And shall neither of these things be placed by us under justice, Euthydemus?" "
It would be strange if they should be," said he.
15. "But," said Socrates, "if a mail, being chosen to lead an army, should reduce to slavery an unjust and hostile people, should we say that he committed injustice?” “
No, certainly," replied he.
“Should we not rather say that he acted justly?” “Indisputably.”
"And if, in the course of tIle war with them, he should practise de­ ceit?"
“That also would be just," said he.
"And if he should steal and carry off their property, would he not do what was just?" "Certainly," said Euthydemus;
"but I thought at first that you asked these questions only with reference to our friends.” " Then," said Socrates, " all that we have placed under the head of injustice, we must also place under that of justice?" " It seems so," replied Euthydemus.
16. "Do you agree, then,” continued Socrates, “that, having so placed them, we should make a new distinction, that it is just to do such things with regard to enemies, but unjust to do them with regard to friends, and that towards his friends our general should be as guileless as possible?" " By all means," replied Euthydemus.
17. “ Well, then," said Socrates, “ if a general, seeing his army dispirited, should tell them, invent­ ing a falsehood, that auxiliaries were coming, and should, by that invention, check the despondency of his troops, under which head should we place such all act of deceit ?”
“It ap­ pears to me,” said Euthydemus, "that we must place it under justice."
"And if a father, when his son requires medicine, and refuses to take it, should deceive him, and give him the medicine as ordinary food, and, by adopting such deception, should restore him to health, under which head must we place such an act of deceit?” “
It appears to me that we must put it under the same head." “
And if a person, when his friend was in despondency, should, through fear that lie might kill himself, steal or take away his sword, or any other weapon, under which head must we place that act?"
"That, as­ suredly, we must place under justice."
Is. “ You say, then," said Socrates, “ that not even towards our friends must we act on all occasions without deceit ?"
“
We must not indeed," said he, “ for I retract what I said before, if I may be per­ mitted to do so." " It is indeed much better that you should be permitted," said Socrates, “than that you should not place actions on the right side.
19. But of those who deceive their friends in order to injure them, (that we may not leave even this point unconsidered,) which of the two is the more unjust, he who docs so intentionally or he who does so involuntarily ?” “ Indeed, Socrates,” said Euthydemus, “I no longer put con­ fidence in the answers which I give;
for all that 1 said be­ fore appears to me now to be quite different from what I then thought;
however, let me venture to say3 that he who de­ ceives intentionally is more unjust than he who deceives in­ voluntarily ?
"20. " Does it appear to you, then, that there is a way of learning and knowing what is just, as there is of learning and knowing how to read and write?"
"I think there is." "
And which should you consider the better scholar, him who should purposely write or read incorrectly, or him who should do so unawares?" " Him who should do so purposely, for, when­ ever he pleased, he would be able to do both correctly." " He, therefore, that purposely writes incorrectly may be a good scholar, but he who does so involuntarily is destitute of scholarship?” “ How can it be otherwise?" "
And whether does lie who lies and deceives intentionally know what is just, or he who docs so unawares ?"
“Doubtless he who does so intentionally."
"You therefore say that he who knows how to write and read is a better scholar than he who does not know?"
"Yes."
"And that he who knows what is just is more just than he who does not know?" “ I seem to say so ;
but I appear to myself to say this I know not how."
21. "But what would you think of the man, who, wishing to tell the truth, should never give the same account of the same thing, but, in speaking of the same road, should say at one time that it led towards the east, and at another towards the west, and, in stating the result of the same calculation, should sometimes assert it to be greater and sometimes less, what, I say, would you think of such a man?”
"It would be quite clear that lie knew nothing of what he thought he knew.
”122. " Do you know any persons called slave-like ?”2 "I do." " Whether for their knowledge or their ignorance?"
“For their ignorance, certainly."
“Is it then for their ignorance of working in brass that they receive this appellation ?"
“Not at all."
"Is it for their ignorance of the art of building?" "Nor for that." " Or for their ignorance of shoemaking?" " Not on any one of these accounts;
for the contrary is tho case, as most of those who know such trades are servile."
"Is this, then, an appellation of those who are ignorant of what is honourable, and good, and just?"
"It appears so to me." 23. " It therefore becomes us to exert ourselves in every way to avoid being like slaves."
" But, by the gods, Socrates," rejoined Euthydemus, "I firmly believed that I was pursuing that course of study, by which I should, as I expected, be made fully acquainted with all that was proper to be known by a man striving after honour and virtue ;
but now, how dispirited must you think I feel, when I see that,with all my previous labour, I am not even able to answer a ques­ tion about what I ought most of all to know, and am ac­ quainted with no other course which I may pursue to become better !
"24. Socrates then said, “Tell me, Euthydemus, have you ever gone to Delphi ?" " Yes, twice," replied he. "
And did you observe what is written somewhere on the temple wall, KNOW THYSELF?"
"I did."
"And did you take no thought of that inscription, or did you attend to it, and try to examine yourself, to ascertain what sort of character you are?" "I did not indeed try, for I thought that I knew very well already, since I should hardly know anything else if I did not know myself,” 25. " But whether does he seem to you to know himself, who knows his own name merely, or he who, (like people buying horses, who do riot think that they know the horse that they want to know, until they have ascertained whether he is tractable or unruly, whether he is strong or weak, swift or slow, and how lie is as to other points which are serviceable or disadvantageous in the use of a horse, so he,) having ascertained with regard to himself how lie is adapted for the service of mankind, knows his own abilities ?"
“It appears to me, I must confess, that he who does not know his own abilities, does not know himself." an. "
But is it not evident," said Socrates, " that men enjoy a great number of blessings in consequence of knowing themselves, and incur a great number of evils, through being deceived in them­ selves?
For they who know themselves know what is suitable for them, and distinguish between what they can do and what they cannot;
and, by doing what they know how to do, pro­ cure for themselves what they need, and are prosperous, and, by abstaining from what they do not know, live blamelessly, and avoid being unfortunate.
By this knowledge of them­ selves, too, they can form an opinion of other men, and, by their experience of the rest of mankind,1 obtain for them- ,-elves what is good, and guard against what is evil.
27. But they who do not know themselves, but are deceived in their own powers, are in similar case with regard to other men,1 and other human affairs, and neither understand what they require, nor what they are doing, nor the characters of those with whom they connect themselves, but, being in error as to all these particulars, they fail to obtain what is good, and fall into evil.
28. They, on the other hand, who understand what they take in hand, succeed in what they attempt, and become esteemed and honoured ;
those who resemble them in character willingly form connexions with them ;
those who are unsuccessful in life desire to be assisted with their ad­ vice,2 and to prefer them to themselves ;
they place in them their hopes of good, and love them, on all these accounts, be­ yond all other men.
20. But those, again, who do not know what they are doing, who make an unhappy choice in life, and arc unsuccessful in what they attempt, not only incur losses and sufferings in their own affairs, but become, in con­ sequence, disreputable and ridiculous, and drag out their lives in contempt and dishonour.
Among states, too, you see that such as, from ignorance of their own strength, go to war with others that are more powerful, are, some of them, utterly verthrown, and others reduced from freedom to slavery.”30. "Be assured, therefore," replied Euthydemus, “that I feel convinced we must consider self-knowledge of the highest value;
but as to the way in which we must begin3 to seek self-knowledge, I look to you for information, if you will kindly impart it to me.”
31. “Well, then," said Socrates, "you doubtless fully understand what sort of things are good, and what sort are evil."
“Yes, by Jupiter," replied Euthy­ demus, "for if I did not understand such things, I should be in a worse condition than slaves arc."
“Come then," said Socrates, "tell me what they are,” " That is not difficult," said he, “for, in the first place, health I consider to be a good, and sickness an evil, and, in the next, looking to the causes of each of them, as drink, food, and employments, I esteem such as conduce to health to be good, and such as lead to sick­ ness to be evil.”
32. “Consequently," said Socrates, " health and sickness themselves, when they are the causes of any good, will be good, and when they are the causes of any evil, will be evil.”
“But when," exclaimed Euthydemus, “can health be the cause of evil, and sickness of good?"
“When, for example,” said Socrates, “some portion of a com­ munity, from being in good health, take part in a disgraceful expedition by land, or a ruinous voyage by sea, or in any other such matters, which are sufficiently common, and lose their lives, while others, who are left behind from ill-health, are saved.”
“What you say is true,” said Euthydemus, "but you see that some men share in successful enterprises from being in health, while others, from being in sickness, are left out of them.”
“Whether then,” said Socrates, “are those things which are sometimes beneficial, and sometimes injuri­ oil.,, goods, rather, or evils ?" “Nothing, by Jupiter, is to be settled with regard to them1 by considering thus.
33. But as to wisdom, Socrates, it is indisputably a good thing ;
for what business will not one who is wise conduct better than one who is untaught?”
“Have you not heard, then, of Dædalus,” said Socrates, "how he was made prisoner by Minos and compelled to serve him as a slave;
how he was cut off, at once, from his country and from liberty, and how, when he endeavoured to escape with his son, he lost the child, and was unable to save himself, but was carried away among barbarians, and wade a second timo a slave?”
“Such a story is told, in­ deed,” said Euthydemus.
“Have you not heard, too, of the sufferings of Palamedes?
for everybody says that it was for his wisdom he was envied and put to death by Ulysses."
“That, too, is said," replied Euthydemus. "
And how many other men do you think have been carried off to the king2 on account of their wisdom, and made slaves there?
”34. " But as to happiness, Socrates,” said Euthydemns, “that at least appears to be an indisputable good." " Yes, Euthydemus," replied Socrates, “if we make it consist in things that are themselves indisputably good.”1 " But what.” said he, "among things constituting happiness can be a doubtful good ?” “Nothing,” answered Socrates, “unless we join with it beauty, or strength, or wealth, or glory, or any other such thing."
35. But we must assuredly join them with it," said Euthydemus;
" for how can a person be happy without them ? "
“We shall then join with it, by Jupiter," said Socrates, "things from which many grievous calamities happen to mankind;
for many, on account of their beauty, are ruined by those who are maddened with passion2 for their youthful attractions ;
many, through confidence in their strength, have entered upon undertakings too great for it, and involved themselves in no small disasters ;
many, in consequence of their wealth, have become enervated, been plotted against, and destroyed ;
and many, from the glory and power that they have acquired in their country, have suffered the greatest calamities."
36. " Well, then," said Euthydemus, " if I do not say what is right when I praise happiness, I confess that I do not know what we ought to pray for to the gods.
"
"These points, however," proceeded Socrates, "you have perhaps not sufficiently considered, from too confident a belief that you were already well acquainted with them;
but since you intend to be at the head of a democratic government, you doubtless know what a democracy is."
"Assuredly," said he.
37. “Do you think it possible for a person to know what a democracy is, without knowing what the Demos is ?" "No, indeed." "
And what do you conceive the Demos to be?"
"I conceive it to be the poorer class of citizens."
"Do you know, then, which are the poor?” “I low can I help know­ ing ? "
“You know then which arc the rich?" "Just as well as I know which arc the poor.”
“Which sort of persons then do you call poor, and which sort rich ? " "
Those who have not sufficient means to pay for the necessaries of life,3 I regard as poor;
those who have more than sufficient, I con- sider rich.”
38. " Have you ever observed, then, that to some who have very small means, those means are not only suffici­ ent, but that they even save from them, while, to many, very large fortunes are not sufficient?"
"I have indeed," said Euthydemus, "(for you very properly put me in mind of it,) since I have known some princes, who, from poverty, have been driven to commit injustice like the very poorest people."
39. " Then,” said Socrates, "if such be the case, we must rank such princes among the Demos, and those that have but little, we must rank, if they be good managers, among the rich ? " "
My own want of knowledge,1 indeed," said Enthydemus, obliges me to admit even this ;
and I am considering whether it would not be best for me to be silent;
for I seem to know absolutely nothing.
"He went away, accordingly, in great dejection, holding him­ self in contempt, and thinking that he was in reality no better than a slave.
40.
Of those who were thus addressed by Socrates, many came to him no more;
and these he regarded as too dull to be improved.
But Euthydemus, on the contrary, conceived that he could by no other means become an estimable charac­ ter, than by associating with Socrates as much as possible;
and he in consequence never quitted him, unless some neces­ sary business obliged him to do so.
He also imitated many of his habits.
When Socrates saw that he was thus disposed, he no longer puzzled him with questions, but explained to him, in the sim­ plest and clearest manner, what he thought that he ought to know, and what it would be best for him to study.
The necessity of temperance or self-control, and of right notions concerning the gods, sect.
1, 2. The gods have a providential care for mankind, 3—9.
Other animals are formed by the gods for the use of man, 10.
In addition to the senses common to man with the inferior animals, the gods have given him reason and speech, 11, 12.
Though we do not see the gods, we are convinced of their existence from their works, 13, 14.
We ought therefore to pay them honour according to our means, 15—18.1.
SOCRATES was never in haste that his followers should become skilful in speaking, in action, or in invention,1 but, previous to such accomplishments, he thought it proper that a love of self-control should be instilled into them ;
for he con­ sidered that those who had acquired those qualifications were, if devoid of self-control, only better fitted to commit injustice and to do mischief.
2. In the first place, therefore, he endea­ voured to impress his associateo with right feelings towards the gods.
Some, who were present with him when he con­ versed with others on this subject, have given an account of his discourses;
but I myself was with him when he held a conversation with Euthydemus to the following effect.
3.
"Tell me," said he, “Euthydemus, has it ever occurred to you to consider how carefully the gods have provided for men everything that they require ? ” “
It has indeed never occurred to me," replied he. "
You know at least," proceeded Socrates, “ that we stand in need, first of all, of light, with which the gods supply us." “ Yes, by Jupiter,” answered Eu­ thydemus, "for if we had no light, we should be, as to the use of our eyes, like the blind."
"But, as we require rest, they afford its night, the most suitable season for repose." “
That is assuredly," said Euthydemus, " a subject for thankfulness."
4. “ Then because the sun, being luminous, shows us the hours of the day, and everything else, while the night, being dark, prevents us from making such distinctions in it,2 have they not caused the stars to shine in the night, which show us the night-watches, and under the direction of which we perform many things that we require ? " "
So it is," said he.
“
The moon, too, makes plain to us not only the divisions of the night, but also of the month."
“Assuredly,” said he.
5. " But that, since we require food, they should raise it for us from the earth, and appoint suitable seasons for the purpose, which prepare for us, in abundance and every variety, not only things which we need, but also things from which we derive pleasure, what do you think of such gifts ?" "
They certainly indicate love for man.”
6. “ And that they should supply us with water, an element of such value to us, that it causes to spring up, and unites with the earth and the seasons in bringing to maturity, everything useful for us, and assists also to nourish ourselves, and, being mixed with all our food, renders it easier of digestion, more serviceable, and more plea­ sant;
and that, as we require water in great quantities, they should supply us with it in such profusion, what do you think of such a gift? ” “ That also," said he, "shows thought for us.” 7. " That they should also give us fire, a protection against cold and darkness, an auxiliary in every art and in everything that men prepare for their use, (for, in a word, men produce nothing, among the various things neces­ sary to life, without the aid of fire,) what do you think of such a gift?"
"That likewise," said he, "gives eminent proof of regard for man." 8. 1 [“ That they should diffuse the air also around us everywhere in such abundance, as not only to preserve and support life, but to enable us to cross the seas by means of it, and to get provisions by sailing hither and thither among foreign lands, is not this a boon inexpressi­ bly valuable ?" “
It is indeed inexpressibly so," replied he.
J “ That the sun, too, when it turns towards us in the winter, should approach to mature some things, and to dry up others2 whose season for ripening has passed away ;
and that, having effected these objects, he should not come nearer to us, but turn back, as if taking care lest lie should hurt us by giving us more heat than is necessary ;
and that when again, in his de­ parture, he arrives at the point at which it becomes evident that, if he were to go beyond it, we should be frozen by the cold, he should again turn towards us, and approach us, and revolve in that precise part of the heaven in which he may be of most advantage to us, what do you think of things so regu­ lated ? " " By Jupiter," replied Euthydemus, they appear to be appointed solely for the sake of man.”
9. “Again, that the sun, because it is certain that we could not endure such beat or cold if it should come upon us suddenly, should ap­ proach us so gradually, and retire from us so gradually, that we are brought imperceptibly to the greatest extremes of both, what do you think of that appointment?" " I am reflecting, indeed," said Euthydemus, " whether the gods can have any other business than to take care of man ;
only this thought embarrasses me, that other animals partake in these benefits.
"10.
"But is not this also evident," said Socrates, “ that these animals are produced and nourished for the sake of man ?”
For what other animal derives so many benefits from goats, sheep, horses, oxen, asses, and other such creatures, as man ?
To me it appears that he gains more advantages from them than from the fruits of the earth ;
at least he is fed and enriched not less from the one than from the other;
and a great portion of mankind do not use the productions of the earth for food, but live by herds of cattle, supported by their milk, and cheese, and flesh;
and all men tame and train the useful sort of animals, and use their services for war and other purposes." " I agree with what you say on that point," said Euthydemus, “ for I see some animals, much stronger than we, rendered so subservient to men that they use them for whatever they please."
11. “But that, since there are num­ berless beautiful and useful objects in the world, greatly dif­ fering from one another, the gods should have bestowed on men senses adapted to each of them, by means of which wo enjoy every advantage from them;
that they should have im­ planted understanding in us, by means of which we reason about what we perceive by the senses, and, assisted by the memory, learn how far everything is beneficial, and contrive many plans by which we enjoy good and avoid evil;
12.
and that they should have given us the faculty of speech, by mean of which we convey information to one another, and mutually impart whatever is good, and participate in it, enact laws, and enjoy constitutional government, what think you of such blessings ? " “ The gods certainly appear, Socrates, to exer­ cise the greatest care for man in every way.”
"And that, since we are unable to foresee what is for our advantage with regard to the future, they should assist us in that respect, communicating what will happen to those who inquire of them by divination, and instructing them how their actions may be most for their benefit, what thoughts does that produce in you ? " “
The gods seem to show you, Socrates," rejoined he, " more favour than other men, since they indicate to you, without being asked, what you ought to do, and what not to do."13.
“And that I speak the truth,1 you yourself also well know, if you do not expect to see the bodily forms of the gods, but will be content, as you behold their works, to wor­ ship and honour them.
Reflect, too, that the gods themselves give us this intimation 2 for the other deities3 that give us blessings, do not bestow any of them by coming manifestly before our sight ;
and lie that orders and holds together the whole universe, in which are all things beautiful and good, and who preserves it always unimpaired, undisordered, and undecaying, obeying his will swifter than thought and with­ out irregularity, is himself manifested only in the perform­ ance of his mighty works, but is invisible to us while he regulates them.
14. Consider also that the sun, which ap­ pears manifest to all, does not allow men to contemplate him too curiously, but, if any one tries to gaze on him steadfastly, deprives him of his sight.
The instruments of the deities you will likewise find imperceptible;
for the thunder-bolt, for in­ stance, though it is plain that it is sent from above, and works its will with everything with which it comes in contact, is yet never seen either approaching, or striking, or retreating ;
the winds, too, are themselves invisible, though their effects are evident to us, and we perceive their course.
The soul of man, moreover, which partakes of the divine nature if any­ thing else in man does, rules, it is evident, within us, but is itself unseen.
Meditating on these facts, therefore, it be­ hoves you not to despise the unseen gods, but, estimating their power from what is done by them, to reverence what is divine.”is.
"I feel clearly persuaded, Socrates," said Euthydemus, “ that I shall never fail, in the slightest degree, in respect for the divine power, but I am dejected at the thought that no one among mankind, as it seems to me, can ever requite the favours of the gods with due gratitude."
16. "But be not dejected at that reflection, Euthydemus," said Socrates, "for you know that the deity at Delphi, whenever any one con­ suits him how he may propitiate the gods, answers, ACCORD­ ING TO TIlE LAW OF YOUlt COUNTRY ;
1 and it is the law, indeed, everywhere, that every man should propitiate the gods with offerings according to his ability ;
and how, there­ fore, can any man honour the gods better or more piously, than by acting as they themselves direct?
17. It behoves us, however, not to do less than we are able, for, when any one acts thus, he plainly shows that he does not honour the gods.
But it becomes him who fails, in no respect, to honour the gods according to his means, to be of good courage, and to hope for the greatest blessings;
for no one can reasonably hope for greater blessings from others than from those who are able to benefit him most;
nor on any other grounds than by propitiating them ;
and how can he propitiate them better than by obeying them to the utmost of his power ?”is.
By uttering such sentiments, and by acting according to them himself, he rendered those who conversed with him more nious and prudent.
Socrates inculcated a love of justice into his followers, He gave them an example of adherence to justice in his own life, sect.
1—4. He commence a conversation with Hippias, a sophist, 4—9.
It is better to be just than merely to talk of justice, 10, 11 ;
it is a part of justice to obey the laws;
what a law is, 12—14 j who are the best magistrates in states, 15 ;
a ge­ neral observance of the laws maintains concord, 16—18;
there are certain unwritten laws, which it is not possible to transgress without incurring punishment, 19—24;
to observe the divine laws is to be just, 25.1.
CONCERNING justice, too, he did not conceal what senti­ ments he entertained, but made them manifest even by his actions, for he conducted himself, in his private capacity, justly and beneficently towards all men, and, as a citizen, he obeyed the magistrates in all that the laws enjoined, both in the city and on military expeditions, so that lie was distin­ guished above other men for his observance of order.
a.
When he was president in the public assembly, lie would not permit the people to give a vote contrary to law, but opposed himself, in defence of the laws, to such a storm of rage on the part of the populace as I think that no other man could have withstood.
1
3. When the Thirty Tyrants commanded him to do anything contrary to the laws, lie refused to obey them ;
for both when they forbade him to converse with the young, and when they ordered him, and some others of the citizens, to lead a certain person2 away to death, he alone did not obey, because the order was given contrary to the laws.
4.
When he was accused by Meletus,3 and others were ac­ customed, before the tribunal, to speak so as to gain the favour of the judges, and to flatter them, and supplicate them, in violation of the laws,4 and many persons, by such practices, had often been acquitted by the judges, he refused, on his trial, to comply with any practices opposed to the laws, and though he might easily have been acquitted by his judges, if he had but in a slight degree adopted any of those customs, he chose rather to die abiding by the laws than to save his life by transgressing them.
5.
He held conversations to this effect with others on several occasions, and I know that he once had a dialogue of the following kind, concerning justice, with Hippias of Elis;
1 for Hippias, on his return to Athens after an absence of some time, happened to conic in the way of Socrates as he was ob­ serving to some people how surprising it was that, if a man wished to have another taught to be a shoemaker, or a car­ penter, or a worker in brass, or a rider, lie was at no loss whither he should send him to effect his object ;
2 [nay, that every place, as some say, was fall of persons who would make a horse or an ox observant of right for any one that desired ;
] while as to justice, if any one wished either to learn it him­ self, or to have his son or his slave taught it, he did not know whither he should go to obtain his desire, 6. Ilippias, hear­ ing this remark, said, as if jesting with him, " What!
are you still saying the same things, Socrates, that I heard from you so long ago?"
"Yes," said Socrates, "and what is more wonderful, I am not only still saying the same things, but am saying them on the same subjects;
but you, perhaps, from being possessed of such variety of knowledge, never say the same things on the same subjects." " Certainly,” replied Hippias, " I do always try to say something new."
7. " About matters of which you have certain knowledge, then," said Socrates, "as, for instance, about the letters of the alphabet, if any one were to ask yon how many and what letters are in the word ' Socrates,' would you try to say sometimes one thing, and sometimes another;
or to people who might ask you about numbers, as whether twice five arc ten, would you not give the same answer at one time as at another?"
"About such matters, Socrates," replied Hippias, " I, like you, always say the same thing;
but concerning justice I think that I have certainly something to say now which neither you nor any other person can refute."
8. “By Juno," returned So­ crates, " it is a great good that you say you have discovered, since the judges will now cease from giving contradictory sen­ tences, the citizens will cease from disputing about what is just, from going to law, and from quarrelling, and communi­ ties will ceasc from contending about their rights and going to war ;
and I know not how I can part with you till I have learned so important a benefit from its discoverer."
9. " You shall not hear it, by Jupiter," rejoined Hippias, “ until you yourself declare what you think justice to be ;
for it is enough that you laugh at others, 1 questioning and confuting every­ body, while you yourself are unwilling to give a reason to anybody, or to declare your opinion on any subject." to. " What then, Hippias,” said Socrates, " have you not per­ ceived that I never cease declaring my opinion as to what I conceive to be just ?" "
And what is this opinion of yours ?" said Hippias. "
If I make it known to you, not by words merely, but by actions, do not deeds seem to you to be a stronger evidence than words?" “ Much stronger, by Jupi­ ter," said Hippias, " for many who say what is just do what is unjust, but a man who does what is just cannot be himself unjust."
11. Have you ever then found me bearing false witness, or giving malicious information, or plunging my friends or the state into quarrels, or doing anything else that is unjust?"
"I have not." "
And do you not think it jus­ tice to refrain from injustice?"
“You are plainly now," said Hippias, " endeavouring to avoid expressing an opinion as to what you think just;
for what you say is, not what the just do, but what they do not do."
12. But I thought," rejoined Socrates, " that to be unwilling to do injustice was a sufficient proof of justice.
If this, however, does not satisfy you, consider whether what I next say will please you better;
for I assert that what is in conformity with the laws is just." " Do you say, Socrates, that to be conformable to the laws, and to be just, is the same thing?" " I do indeed."
13. "I am puzzled;
for I do not understand what you call conform­ able to law, or what you call just." “ Do you know the laws of the state ?" said Socrates. “ I do," said the other.
"And what do you consider them to be?"
"What the citizens in con­ cert have enacted as to what we ought to do, and what we ought to avoid doing." “
Would not he, therefore," asked Socrates, “ be an observer of the laws, who should conduct himself in the community agreeably to those enactments, and he be a violater of the laws who transgresses them ?" " Undoubt­ edly," said Hippias. “ Would not lie then do what is just who obeys the laws, and he do what is unjust who disobeys them ?” “Certainly.” "
Is not he then just who does what is just, and he unjust who does what is unjust?"
“How can it be other­ wise?" “
He therefore that conforms to the laws is just," added Socrates, ”and he who violates the laws, unjust.
"14. “ But,” objected Hippias, “ how can any oneimagine the laws, or obedience to them, to be a matter of absolute im­ portance, when the very persons who make them often reject and alter them ?”
“That objection is of no consequence," said Socrates, "for states, which have commenced war, often make peace again." "
Undoubtedly they do," said Hippias. "
What difference will there be in your conduct, then, think you, 1 if you throw contempt on those who obey the laws, be­ cause the laws may be changed, and if you blame those who act properly in war, because peace may be made ?
Do you condemn those who vigorously support their country in war ?” “ I do not indeed," replied Hippias.
is. ”
Have you ever heard it said of Lycurgus the Lacedæmonian, then," said So­ crates, “ that he would not have made Sparta at all different from other states, if he had not established in it, beyond others, a spirit of obedience to the laws ?
Do you not know, too, that of magistrates in states, those are thought the best who are most efficient in producing obedience to the laws, and that that state, in which the citizens pay most respect to the laws, is in the best condition
In peace, and invincible in war?
16. The greatest blessing to states, moreover, is concord ;
and the senates and principal men in them often exhort the citizens to unanimity;
and everywhere throughout Greece it is a law that the citizens shall take an oath to observe concord, an oath which they every where do take;
but I conceive that this is done, not that the citizens may approve of the same choruses, or that they may praise the same flute-players, or that they may prefer the same poets,1 or that they may take delight in the same spectacles, but that they may obey the laws ;
for while the citizens adhere to these, states will be eminently powerful and happy;
but without such unanimity, no state can be well governed, nor any family well regulated.
17. As an indi­ vidual citizen, too, how could any person render himself less liable to penalties from the government, or more likely to have honours bestowed upon him, than by being obedient to the laws?
How else would he incur fewer defeats in the courts of justice, or how more certainly obtain sentence in his favour?
To whom would any one believe that he could more safely confide his money, or his sons or daughters ?
Whom would the whole community deem more trustworthy than him who respects the laws ?
From whom would parents, or relatives, or domestics, or friends, or citizens, or strangers, more certainly obtain their rights ?
To whom would the enemy sooner trust in cessations of arms, or in making a truce, or articles of peace?
To whom would people more willingly become allies than to the observer of the laws, and to whom would the allies more willingly trust the leadership, or com­ mand of a fortress, or of a city ?
From whom would any one expect to meet with gratitude, on doing him a kindness, sooner than from the observer of the laws ?
Or whom would any one rather serve than him from whom he expects to re­ ceive a return ?
To whom would any one more desire to be a friend, or less desire to be an enemy, than such a man ?
With whom would any one be less inclined to go to war, than with him to whom lie would most wish to be a friend, and least of all an enemy, and to whom the greatest part of mankind would wish to be friends and allies, and but a small number to be antagonists and enemies?
is.
I, therefore, Hippias, pronounce that to obey the laws and to be just is the same if you hold an opinion to the contrary, tell me."
“Indeed, Socrates," rejoined Hippias, " I do not know that I entertain any sentiments opposed to what you have said of justice.
"19. “ But are you aware, Ilippias," continued Socrates, " that there are unwritten laws?"
"You mean those," said Hippias, that are in force about the same points every­ where."
“Can you affirm, then, that men made those laws?” "
How could they,” said Hippias, "when they could not all meet together, and do not all speak the same language?" "
Whom then do you suppose to have made these laws?"
"I believe,” said he, "that it was the gods who made these laws for men, for among all men the first law is to venerate the gods." 20. " Is it not also a law everywhere to honour parents?”
"It is so."
"Is it not a law, too, that parents shall not intermarry with their children, nor children with their parents?”
“This does not as yet, Socrates, appear to me to be a law of the gods?" " Why?” " Because I find that some nations transgress it."
21. “ Many others, too, they transgress,” said Socrates;
"but those who violate the laws made by the gods incur punishment which it is by no means possible for man to escape, as many transgressors of the laws made by men escape punishment, some by concealment, others by open violence."
22. “ And what sort of punishment, Socrates," said he, "cannot parents escape who intermarry with their children, and children who intermarry with their parents?”
"The greatest of all punishments, by Jupiter," replied Socrates, for what greater penalty can those who beget children incur, than to have bad children ?” 23. “ How then," said Hippias, "do they necessarily have bad children, when nothing hinders but that they may he good themselves, and have children by good partners?”
“Decause,” returned Socrates, “it is not only necessary that those who have chil­ dren by each other should be good, but that they should be in full bodily vigour.
1
Or do you suppose that the seed of those who are at the height of maturity is similar to that of those who have not yet reached maturity, or to that of those who are far past it?" “ By Jupiter,” replied Hippias, “ it is not at all likely that it should be similar." " Which of the two then is the better?"
"Doubtless that of those at full maturity.” "
That of those who are not at full maturity, then, is not sum­ ciently energetic.” " Probably not." " Accordingly they ought not to have children?"
"No." “Do not those, therefore, who have children under such circumstances, have them as they ought not?”
"So it appears to me."
“What other persons, therefore, will have bad children, if not these?" “ Well,” said Hippias, " I agree with you on this point also.
"24. "Is it not everywhere a law, also," said Socrates, “that men should do good to those who do good to them?” “
It is a law,” answered Hippias, “but it is transgressed.” "
Do not those therefore who transgress it incur punishment,” continued Socrates, " by being deprived of good friends, and being com­ pelled to have recourse to those who hate them?
Are not such as do service to those who seek it of them good friends to themselves, and are not those who make no return to such as serve them hated by them for their ingratitude ;
and yet, be­ cause it is for their advantage to have their support, do they not pay the greatest court to them?”
“Indeed, Socrates,” replied Hippias, "all these things seem to suit the character of the gods;
for that the laws themselves should carry with them punishments for those who transgress them, appears to me to be the appointment of a lawgiver superior to man."as.
“Whether, therefore, Hippias,” added Socrates, "do you consider that the gods appoint as laws, what is agreeable to justice, or what is at variance with justice ?”
Not what is at variance with justice, certainly," said Hippias,” “for scarcely would any other make laws in conformity with justice, if a god were not to do so."
"It is the pleasure of the gods, therefore, Hippias,” concluded Socrates, "that what is in conformity with justice should also be in conformity with the laws."
1By uttering such sentiments, and acting in agreement with them, he rendered those who conversed with him more ob­ servant of justice.
Socrates rendered his followers better qualified for public life.
The neces­ sity of temperante, sect.
1,2;
the evils of intemperance, 3—7;
the benefits arising from temperance, 8—10;
the conduct of the temperate man, 11, 12.I.
I WILL now relate how lie rendered his followers better qualified for the management of public business.
Thinking it expedient that temperance should be observed by him who would succeed in anything honourable, he first made it evi­ dent to those who conversed with him, that he practised this virtue beyond all other men, and then, by his discourse, he exhorted his followers, above everything, to the observance of temperance.
He continued always, therefore, to make allu­ sions to whatever was conducive to virtue ;
and I know that he once held a conversation on temperance with Euthydemus to the following effect:
2. " Tell me," said he, "Euthydemus, do you regard liberty as an excellent and honourable posses­ sion for an individual or a community ? "
“The most excel­ lent and honourable that can be,” replied he.
3. “ Do you consider him, then, who is held under control by the pleasures of the body, and is rendered unable, by their influence, to do what is best for him, to be free ?" " By no means," replied Euthydemus.
"Perhaps, then, to have the power of doing what is best seems to you to be freedom, but to be under in­ fluences which will hinder, you from doing it, you consider to be want of freedom?" "Assuredly," said he.
4. Do not the intemperate appear to you, then, to be absolutely without freedom?"
"Yes, by Jupiter, and naturally so." "
And whether do the intemperate appear to you to be merely pre­ vented from doing what is best, or to be forced, also, to do what is most dishonourable?"
"They appear to me," replied Eu­ thydemus, “ to be not less forced to do the one than they are hindered from doing the other."
5. And what sort of mas­ ters do you consider those to be, who hinder men from doing what is best, and force them to do what is worst?” " The very worst possible, by Jupiter," replied he. "
And what sort of slavery do you consider to be the worst ? " " That," said he, “ under the worst masters." " Do not then the in- temperate," said Socrates, "endure the very worst of slavery?" '
It appears so to me," answered Euthydemus.
e.
And does not intemperance seem to you, by banishing from men prudence, the greatest good, to drive them into the very oppo­ site evil?
Does it not appear to you to hinder them from attending to useful things, and learning them, by drawing them away to pleasure, and frequently, by captivating those who have a perception of good and evil, to make them choose the worse instead of the better ?" “ Such is the case," said he.
7. " And whom can we suppose, Euthydemus, to have less participation in self-control than the intemperate man ?
for assuredly the acts of self-control and of intemperance are the very opposite to each other.” " I assent to this also,” said he. "
And do you think that anything is a greater hindrance to attention to what is becoming, than intemperance ?"
"I do not."
“And do you imagine that there is any greater evil to man, than that which makes him prefer the noxious to the beneficial, which prompts him to pursue the one and to neg­ lect the other, and which forces him to pursue a contrary course of conduct to that of the wise ? ” “
There is none," said Euthydemus.8. " Is it not natural, then," said Socrates, “ that temperance should be the cause of producing in men effects contrary to those which intemperance produces?” “ Undoubtedly,” said Euthydemus. "
Is it not natural, therefore, also, that what produces those contrary effects should be best for man ? " "
It is natural," said he.
"Is it not consequently natural, then, Euthydemus, that temperance should be best for man ? " "It is so, Socrates," said he.
9. And have you ever reflected upon this, Enthydemus ? " “ What ? " “
That even to those pleasures, to which alone intemperance seems to lead men, it cannot lead them, but that temperance produces greater plea­ sure than anything else?"
"How?" said he. "
Because intemperance, by not allowing men to withstand hunger, thirst, or the desire of sensual gratification, or want of sleep, (through which privations alone is it possible for them to eat, and drink, and gratify other natural appetites, and go to rest and sleep with pleasure, waiting and restraining themselves until the inclinations may be most happily indulged,) hinders them from having any due enjoyment in acts most necessary and most habitual;
but temperance, which alone enables men to endure the privations which I have mentioned, alone enables them to find delight in the gratifications to which I have alluded."
“ What you say," observed Euthydemus, “ is indis­ putably true."
10. “ From learning what is honourable and good, moreover, and from the study of those accomplishments by which a man may ably govern himself, judiciously regulate his household, become useful to his friends and the state, and gain the mastery over his enemies, (from which studies arise not only the greatest advantages, but also the greatest plea­ sures,) the temperate have enjoyment while they practise them, but the intemperate have no share in any of them ;
for to whom can we say that it less belongs to participate in such advantages, than to him who has the least power to pursue them, being wholly occupied in attention to present pleasures ?”
II.
“You seem to me, Socrates,” said Euthydemus, "to say that the man who is under the influence of bodily pleasures, has no participation in any one virtue." "
For what differ­ ence is there, Euthydemus," said he, " between an intemperate man and the most ignorant brute ?
How will he, who has no regard to what is best, but seeks only to enjoy what is most seductive by any means in his power, differ from the most senseless cattle ?
To the temperate alone it belongs to con­ sider what is best in human pursuits, to distinguish those pur­ suits, according to experience and reason, into their several classes, and then to choose the good and refrain from the evil."12.
Thus it was, he said, that men became most virtuous and happy, and most skilful in reasoning;
and he observed that the expression διαλέγεσϑαι, " to reason," had its origin in people's practice of meeting together to reason on matters, and distinguishing them, διαλέγοντας, according to their several kinds.
It was the duty of every one, therefore, he thought, to make himself ready in this art, and to study it with the greatest diligence;
for that men, by the aid of it, became most accomplished, most able to guide others, and most acute in discussion.
The value of skill in argument and definition, sect.

of WISDOM, 7 ;
of GOODNESS and BEAUTY, 8, 9 of COURAOE, 10, 11.
Some other definitions, 12. Remarks on the So­ cratic method of argument, 13—15.1.
I WILL now endeavour to show that Socrates rendered those who associated with torn more skilful in argument.
For he thought that those who knew the nature of things sever­ ally, would be able to explain them to others;
but as to those who did not know, he said that it was not surprising that they fell into error themselves, and led others into it.
He therefore never ceased to reason with his associates about the nature of things.
1
To go through all the terms that he defined, and to show how lie defined them, would be a long task ;
but I will give as many instances as I think will suffice to show the nature of his reasoning.
2.
In the first place, then, he reasoned of PIETY, in some such way as this. “ Tell me,” said he, “Euthydemus, what sort of feeling do you consider piety to be ? " “ The most noble of all feelings," replied he. "
Can you tell me, then, who is a pious man ? " " The man, I think, who honours the gods."
"Is it allowable to pay honour to the gods in any way that one pleases ? " "
No ;
there are certain laws in con­ formity with which we must pay our honours to them."
3. " He, then, who knows these laws, will know how he must honour the gods ?" “ I think so." “ He therefore who knows how to pay honour to the gods, will not think that he ought to pay it otherwise than as he knows?" " Doubtless not."
“Bu does any one pay honours to the gods otherwise than as he thinks that he ought to pay them ?" " I think not.”
4. "He therefore who knows what is agreeable to the laws with re­ gard to the gods, will honour the gods in agreement with the laws?" “Certainly.”
"Does not he, then, who honours the gods agreeably to the laws honour them as he ought ? " "How can he do otherwise ?” “
And he who honours them as he ought, is pious ?" "Certainly." “
He therefore who knows what is agreeable to the laws with regard to the gods, may be justly defined by us as a pious man ?” “
So it appears to me," said Euthydemus.5.
"But is it allowable for a person to conduct himself towards other men in whatever way he pleases ?" "
No;
but with respect to men also, he who knows what is in conformity with the laws, and how men ought, according to them, to conduct themselves towards each other, will be an observer of the laws." " Do not those, then, who conduct themselves towards each other according to what is in conformity with the laws, conduct themselves towards each other as they ought?"
"How can it be otherwise ?" "Do not those, there­ fore, who conduct themselves towards each other as they ought, conduct themselves well ?" " Certainly.”
"Do not those, then, that conduct themselves well towards each other, act pro­ perlyin transactions between man and man?” "Surely." " Do not those, then, who obey the laws, do what is just ?" “ Un­ doubtedly."
6. “ And do you know what sort of actions are called just?" " Those which the laws sanction."
"Those, therefore, who do what the laws sanction, do what is just, and what they ought ? " "
How can it be otherwise ? " "
Those who do just things, therefore, arc just ? "
"I think so." "
Do you think that any persons yield obedience to the laws who do not know what the laws sanction ?"
"I do not."
"And do you think that any who know what they ought to do, think that they ought not to do it ?" “ I do not think so." "
And do you know any persons that do other things than those which they think they ought to do ?" " I do not." “ Those, therefore, who know what is agreeable to the laws in regard to men, do what is just?" "Certainly."
"And are not those who do what is just, just men?"
“Who else can be so?"
"Shall we not define rightly, therefore," concluded Socrates, “ if we define those to be just who know what is agreeable to the laws in regard to men ? ” “ It appears so to me,” said Euthydemus.7. “
And what shall we say that WISDOM is ?
Tell me, whether do men seem to you to be wise, in things which they know, or in things which they do not know?"
"In what they know, certainly ;
for how can a man be wise in things of which he knows nothing ?" “
Those, then, who are wise, are wise by their knowledge?"
"By what else can a man be wise, if not by his knowledge?"
"Do you think wisdom, then, to be anything else than that by which men are wise?' “ I do not." " Is knowledge, then, wisdom ? " “ It ap­ pears so to me." " Does it appear to you, however, that it is possible for a man to know all things that are?" " No, by Jupiter;
not even, as I think, a comparatively small portion of them ?" “ It is not therefore possible for a man to be wise in all things?"
"No, indeed."
"Every man is wise, there­ fore, in that only of which he has a knowledge ?" "So it seems to me."8. "Shall we thus, too, Euthydemus," said he, "inquire what is GOOD?" “ How?” said Euthydemus.
"Does the same thing appear to you to be beneficial to everybody?" "No." "And does not that which is beneficial to one person appear to you to be sometimes hurtful to another?" " As­ suredly." “ Would you say, then, that anything is good that is not beneficial?"
"I would not."
“What is beneficial, therefore, is good, to whomsoever it is beneficial?" “
It ap­ pears so to me," said Euthydemus.9. “
And can we define the BEAUTIFUL in any other way than if you term whatever is beautiful, whether a person, or a vase, or anything else whatsoever, beautiful for whatever purpose you know that it is beautiful ?”1 "No, indeed," said Euthydemus. "
For whatever purpose, then, anything may be useful, for that purpose it is beautiful to use it ?" " Cer­ tainly."
"And is anything beautiful for any other purpose than that for which it is beautiful to use it ?" “ For no other purpose," replied he. "
What is useful is beautiful, therefore, for that purpose for which it is beautiful?"
"So I think," said lie.10.
"As to COURAGE, Euthydemus,” said Socrates, "do you think it is to be numbered among excellent things?" " I think it one of the most excellent," replied Euthydemus.
But you do not think courage a thing of use for small occa­ sions."
" No, by Jupiter, but for the very greatest." “
Does it appear to you to be useful, with regard to formidable and dangerous things, to be ignorant of their character?"
"By no means." ‟
They, therefore, who do not fear such things, because they do not know what they are, are not courage­ ous ?" "
Certainly not;
for, in that case, many madmen and even cowards would be courageous." “
And what do you say of those who fear things that are not formidable?"
"Still less, by Jupiter, should they be called courageous." "
Those, then, that are good, with reference to formidable and danger­ ous things, you consider to be courageous, and those that are had, cowardly ?" "Certainly."
11. “ But do you think that any other persons are good, with reference to terrible and dangerous circumstances, except those who are able to conduct themselves well under them?"
"No, those only," said he. "
And you think those bad with regard to them, who are of such a character as to conduct themselves badly under them ?" “ Whom else can I think so?"
"Do not each, then, conduct themselves under them as they think they ought?" "
How can it be otherwise?”
"Do those, therefore, who do not conduct themselves properly under them, know how they ought to conduct themselves under them?" "Doubtless not." "
Those then who know how they ought to conduct them­ selves under them, can do so?"
"And they alone." "
Do those, therefore, who do not fail under such circumstances, conduct themselves badly under them?"
"I think not." " Those, then, who do conduct themselves badly under them, do fail?" ..
It seems so." “ Those, therefore, who know how to conduct themselves well in terrible and dangerous circum­ stances are courageous, and those who fail to do so are cow­ ards?" “ They at least appear so to me,” said Euthydemus.
12.
" Monarchy and tyranny he considered to be both forms of government, but conceived that they differed greatly from one another ;
for a government over men with their own con­ sent, and in conformity with the laws of free states, he re­ garded as a monarchy;
but a government over men against their will, and not according to the law of free states, but just as the ruler pleased, a tyranny;
and wherever magistrates were appointed from among those who complied with the injunctions of the laws, he considered the government to be an aristocracy ;
wherever they were appointed according to their wealth, a plutocracy;
and wherever they were appointed from among the whole people, a democracy.
13.
Whenever any person contradicted him on any point who had nothing definite to say, and who perhaps asserted, without proof, that some person, whom he mentioned, was wiser, or better skilled in political affairs, or possessed of greater courage, or worthier in some such respect, [than some other whom Socrates had mentioned,] he would recall the whole argument, in some such way as the following, to the primary proposition:
14. “ Do you say that he whom you commend, is a better citizen than he whom I commend?"
"I do say so." "
Why should we not then consider, in the first place, what is the duty of a good citizen ? " “ Let us do so." " Would not he then be superior in the management of the public money who should make the state richer?"
"Un­ doubtedly." "
And he in war who should make it victorious over its enemies?" " Assuredly.” " And in an embassy he who should make friends of foes ?" “ Doubtless." “
And he in addressing the people who should check dissension and inspire them with unanimity?"
"I think so."
When the discussion was thus brought back to fundamental principles, the truth was made evident to those who had opposed him.
15.
When he himself went through any subject in argu­ ment, he proceeded upon propositions of which the truth was generally acknowledged, thinking that a sure foundation was thus formed for his reasoning.
Accordingly, whenever he spoke, he, of all men that I have known, most readily pre­ vailed on his hearers to assent to his arguments ;
and he used to say that Homer 1 had attributed to Ulysses the character of a sure orator, as being able to form his reasoning on points acknowledged by all mankind.
How Socrates rendered his followers μηχανικοὐς, ingenious and adapted for business;
his frankness and sincerity, 1. How far he thought that Geo­ metryshould be studied, 2, 3.
How far he recommended that Astronomy shouldbe pursued, 4—7.
Vain investigations to be avoided, 8. Regard to be paid to health, 9. Counsel to be asked of the gods, 10.I. THAT Socrates expressed his sentiments with sincerity to those who conversed with him, is, I think, manifest from what I have said.
I will now proceed to show how much it was his care that his followers should be competently qualified for em­ ployments suited to their powers.
Of all men that I have known, he was the most anxious to discover in what occupa­ tion each of those who attended him was likely to prove skilful;
and of all that it becomes a man of honour and virtue to know, he taught them himself, whatever he knew, with the utmost cheerfulness ;
and what he had not sufficient know­ ledge to teach, he took them to those who knew, to learn.
2.
He taught them also how far it was proper that a well­ educated man should be versed in any department of know­ ledge.
1 Geometry, for instance, he said that a man should study until he should be capable, if occasion required, to take or give land correctly by measurement;
or to divide it or por­ tion it out for cultivation ;
2 and this, he observed, it was so easy to learn, that he who gave any attention at all to mensur­ ation, might find how large the whole earth was, and perfectly understand how it was measured.
3. But of pursuing the study of geometry to diagrams hard to understand, he disap­ proved ;
for he said that he could not see of what profit they were,3 though he himself was by no means unskilled in them ;
but he remarked that they were enough to consume a man's whole life, and hinder him from attaining many other valuable branches of knowledge.
4.
He recommended his followers to learn astronomy also, but only so far as to be able to know the hour of the night, the month, and the season of the year, with a view to travel­ ling by land or sea, or distinguishing the night-watches ;
and to be competent, by knowing the divisions of the above-men­ tioned times, to profit by the signs for whatever other things are done at a certain period of the night, or month, or year.
These particulars, he said, were easily learned from men who hunted by night, from pilots, and from many others whose business it was to know them.
5. But to continue the study of astronomy so far as to distinguish the bodies which do not move in the same circle with the heaven,1 the planets, and the irre­ gular stars,2 and to weary ourselves in inquiring into their distances from the earth, the periods of their revolutions, and the causes of all these things, was what lie greatly discoun­ tenanced ;
for he saw, he said, no profit in these studies either, 3 though he had himself given attention to them ;
since they also, lie remarked, were enough to wear ont the life of a man, and prevent him from attending to many profitable pursuits.
6.
Concerning celestial matters in general, he dissuaded every man from becoming a speculator how the divine power contrives to manage them ;
for he did not think that such points were discoverable by man, nor did lie believe that those acted dutifully towards the gods who inquired into things which they did not wish to make known.
He observed, too, that a man who was anxious about such investigations, was in danger of losing his senses, not less than Anaxagoras, who prided himself highly on eXplaining the plans of the gods, lost his.
7. For Anaxagoras, when he said that fire and the sun were of the same nature, did not reflect that people can easily look upon fire, but cannot turn their gaze on the sun, and that men, if exposed to the rays of the sun, have complexions of a darker shade, but not if exposed to fire;
he omitted to con­ sider, too, that of the productions of the earth, none can come fairly to maturity without the rays of the sun, while, if warmed by the heat of fire, they all perish ;
and when he said that the sun was a heated stone, he forgot that a stone placed in the fire does not shine, or last long, but that the sun continues perpetually the most luminous of all bodies.
8.
He advised his followers also to learn computations,1 but in these, as in other things, lie exhorted them to avoid useless labour;
as far as it was of any profit, he investigated every­ thing himself, and went through it with his associates,9.
He earnestly recommended those who conversed with him to take care of their health, both by learning whatever they could respecting it from men of experience, and by at­ tending to it, each for himself, throughout his whole life, studying what food or drink, or what exercise, was most suitable for him, and how he might act in regard to them so as to enjoy the best health;
for he said it would be difficult for a person who thus attended to himself to find a physician that would tell better than himself what was conducive to his health.
10.
But if any one desired to attain to what was beyond human wisdom, he advised him to study divination ;
for he said that he who knew by what signs the gods give indications to men respecting human affairs, would never fail of obtaining counsel from the gods.
Socrates, though condemned to death, was not convicted of falsehood with regard to his DÆMON.
His resolution to die.
His innocence inspires nim with courage.
He thinks it good to die, and escape the evils of old age.
Summary of the arguments of the Memorabilia.1.
BUT if any one thinks that he was convicted of falsehood with regard to his DÆMON, because sentence of death was pronounced on him by the judges although he said that the dæmon admonished him what he ought and what lie ought not to do, let him consider, in the first place, that he was already so advanced in years,2 that lie must have ended his life, if not then, at least not long after;
and, in the next, that he relinquished only the most burdensome part of life, in which all feel their powers of intellect diminished, while, in­ stead of enduring this, he acquired great glory by proving the firmness of his mind, pleading his cause, above all men, with the greatest regard to truth, ingenuousness, and justice, and bearing his sentence at once with the utmost resignation and the utmost fortitude.
2.
It is indeed acknowledged that no man, of all that are remembered, ever endured death with greater glory ;
for he was obliged to live thirty days after his sentence, because the Delian festival1 happened in that month, and the law allowed no one to be publicly put to death until the sacred deputation should return from Delos ;
and during that time he was seen by all his friends living in no other way than at any preceding period;
and, let it be observed, throughout all the former part of his life he had been admired beyond all men for the cheerfulness and tranquillity with which he lived.
3.2 How could any one have died more nobly than thus?
Or what death could be more honourable than that which any man might most honourably undergo ?
Or what death could be happier than the most honourable ?
Or what death more ac­ ceptable to the gods than the most happy ?4.
I will also relate what I heard3 respecting him from Hermogenes,4 the son of Ilipponicus, who said that after Meletus had laid the accusation against him, he heard him speaking on any subject rather than that of his trial, and re­ marked to him that he ought to consider what defence he should make, but that he said at first, " Do I not appear to you to have passed my whole life meditating on that subject ?"5 and then, when he asked him " How so?" he said that "he had gone through life doing nothing but considering what was just and what unjust, doing what was just and abstaining from what was unjust, which he conceived to be the best meditation for his defence."
5. Hermogenes said again, "Do you not see, Socrates, that the judges at Athens have already put to death many innocent persons, from being otfended at their language, and have allowed many that were guilty to escape?" " But, by Jupiter, Hermogenes," replied he, " when I was proceeding, a while ago, to study my address to the judges, the dæmon testified disapprobation." " You say what is strange," rejoined Hermogenes. "
And do you think it strange," inquired Socrates, "that it should seem bet­ ter to the divinity that I should now close my life?
Do you not know, that, down to the present time, I would not admit to any man that he has lived either better or with more pleasure than myself?
for I consider that those live best who study best to become as good as possible ;
and that those live with most pleasure who feel the most assurance that they are daily growing better and better.
7. This assurance I have felt, tc the present day, to he the case with respect to myself;
and associating with other men, and comparing myself with others I have always retained this opinion respecting myself;
and, not only I, but my friends also, maintain a similar feeling with regard to me, not because they love me, (for those whc Cove others may be thus affected towards the objects of their love,) but because they think that while they associated with me they became greatly advanced in virtue.
8. If I shall live a longer period, perhaps I shall be destined to sustain the evils of old age, to find my sight and hearing weakened, to feel my intellect impaired, to become less apt to learn, and more forgetful, and, in fine, to grow inferior to others in all those qualities in which I was once superior to them.
If I should be insensible to this deterioration, life would not be worth retaining;
and, if I should feel it, how could I live otherwise than with less profit, and with less comfort ?
9. If I am to die unjustly, my death will be a disgrace to those who unjustly kill me;
for if injustice is a disgrace, must it not be a disgrace to do anything unjustly?
But what disgrace will it be to me, that others could not decide or act justly with re­ gard to me?
16. Of the men who have lived before me, I see that the estimation left among posterity with regard to such as have done wrong, and such as have suffered wrong, is by no means similar;
and I know that I also, if I now die, shall obtain from mankind far different consideration from that which they will pay to those who take my life ;
for I know that they will always bear witness to me that I have never wronged any man, or rendered any man less virtuous, but that I have always endeavoured to make those better who con­ versed with me."
Such discourse he held with Hermogenes, and with others.
11.
Of those who knew what sort of man Socrates was, such as were lovers of virtue, continue to regret him above all other men, even to the present day, as having contributed in the highest degree to their advancement in goodness.
To me, being such as I have described him, so pious that he did nothing without the sanction of the gods;
so just, that he wronged no man even in the most trifling affair, but was of service, in the most important matters, to those who enjoyed his society ;
so temperate, that lie never preferred pleasure to virtue;
so wise, that he never erred in distinguishing better from worse, needing no counsel from others, but being suffi­ cient in himself to discriminate between them ;
so able to ex­ plain and settle such questions by argument;
and so capable of discerning the character of others, of confuting those who were in error, and of exhorting them to virtue and honour, he seemed to be such as the best and happiest of men would be.
But if any one disapproves of my opinion, let him compare the conduct of others with that of Socrates, and determine accordingly.

M. i 4. 3ON the sense of the phrase άναπτυσσμν το ρας, Anab. i. 10. 9. I might have expressed myself in the note with more decision.
The meaning of the words is evidently similar to that of ἀναπτύσσοντας την φάλαγγα, and ἀναπτυχϧείσης τη̄ς φάλαγγος, Cyrop. vii. 5. 3 and 5, where those expressions are fully explained by the context.
A portion of the men were withdrawn from one or both wings of the φάλαγξ, or main body, and sent to the rear, making the line at once shorter and deeper.
Thus the Greeks acted with regard to their wing;
they either drew back the wing altogether, and formed it be­ hind the main body, or drew back a portion of the men from the extremity of the wing, and formed them behind the front ranks of the wing, in order to make the wing itself deeper and more com­ pact.
I think the latter supposition, which confines ἀναπτὺσσειν to ὸ κέρας, the more probable.
The Greeks " pu' the river in their rear " by wheeling round.
Of Professor Maiden's translation of παρἀ τὸν φᾱσιν ποταμόν, "along the river Phasis," I was not aware, until I saw it mentioned by Mr. Ainsworth in his Commentary, p. 226, or I should have adopted it.
If the student should observe that the negative οὔκουν, in Kühner's text of the Memorabilia, is, in some few passages, not translated negatively, he inst suppose that, in such cases, I thought a posi­ tive sense would be better Editors vary, in many places, in the accentuation of this wordLONDON PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, DURE STREET STAMFORD AND GREAT WINDMILL STREET.
