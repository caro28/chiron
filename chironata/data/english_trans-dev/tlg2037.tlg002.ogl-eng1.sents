IT may be necessary to mention, that in arranging the Odes, the Translator has adopted the Order of the Vatican MS.
For those who wish to refer to the original, he has prefixed an Index, which marks the number of each Ode in Barnes and the other editions.
SIR, IN allowing me to dedicate this Work to your Royal Highness, you have conferred upon me an honour, which I feel very sensibly;
and I have only to regret, that the pages which you have thus distinguished, are not more deserving of such illustrious patronage.
Believe me, SIR, With every sentiment of respect, Your Royal Highness's Very grateful and devoted Servant, THOMAS MOORE.ODE BARNES.
For the order of the rest, see the Notes.

Hence, sprung the laurels of the ancient Greek!
Nay, if we read the Samian sage* aright, That souls through various bodies wend their flight, No more we wonder, when we all agree, Anacreon's spirit is transfused in thee.
THERE is little known with certainty of the life of Anacreon.
Chamæleon Hera- cleotes,* who wrote upon the subject, has been lost in the general wreck of ancient literature.
The editors of the poet have collected the few trifling anecdotes, which are scattered through the extant authors of antiquity, and supplying the deficiency of materials by fictions of their own imagina- tion, they have arranged, what they call, a life of Anacreon.
These specious fabrica- tions are intended to indulge that interest which we naturally feel in the biography of illustrious men;
but it is rather a dangerous kind of illusion, as it confounds the limits of history and romancer and is too often supported by unfaithful citation.
tOur poet was born in the city of T2os, in the delicious region of Ionia, where every thing respired voluptuousness. ‡
The time of his birth appears to have been in the sixth century before Christ, and he flourished at that remarkable period, when, under the polished tyrants Hipparchus and Polycrates, Athens and Samos were the rival asylums of genius.
The name of his father is doubt- ful, and therefore cannot be very interesting.
His family was, perhaps, illustrious;
but those who discover in Plato that he was a descendant of the monarch Codrus, exhibit, as usual, more zeal than accuracy.
tThe disposition and talents of Anacreon recommended him to the monarch of Samos, and he was formed to be the friend of such a prince as Polycrates.
Susceptible only to the pleasures, he felt not the corruptions of the court;
and while Pythagoras fled from the tyrant, Anacreon was celebrating his praises on the lyre.
We are told too by Maximus Tyrius, that by the influence of his amatory songs, he softened the mind of Polycrates into a spirit of benevolence towards his subjects.
*The amours of the poet, and the rival- ship of the tyrant, † I shall pass over in silence;
and there are few, I presume, who will regret the omission of most of those anecdotes, which the industry of some edi- tors has not only promulged, but discussed.
Whatever is repugnant to modesty and vir- tue is considered in ethical science, by a supposition very favourable to humanity, as impossible;
and this amiable persuasion should be much more strongly entertained, where the transgression wars with nature as well as virtue.
But why are we not allowed to indulge in the presumption?
Why are we officiously reminded that there have been such instances of depravity ?
Hipparchus, who now maintained at Athens the power which his father Pisis- tratus had usurped, was one of those ele- gant princes who have polished the fetters of their subjects.
He was the first, accord- ing to Plato, who edited the poems of Ho- mer, and commanded them to be sung by the rhapsodists at the celebration of the Panathenæa.
As his court was the galaxy of genius, Anacreon should not be absent.
Hipparchus sent a barge for him;
the poet embraced the invitation, and the muses and the loves were wafted with him to Athens.
*The manner of Anacreon's death was singular.
We are told that in the eighty- fifth year of his age he was choked by a grape-stone ;
† and however we may smile at their enthusiastic partiality, who pretend that it was a peculiar indulgence of Heaven which stole him from the world by this easy and characteristic death, we cannot help admiring that his fate should be so emblematic of.
his disposition.
Cælius Calcagninus alludes to this catastrophe in the following epitaph on our poet:
* Then, hallow'd Sage, those lips which pour’d along
The sweetest lapses of the cygnet's song, A grape has clos'd forever!
Here let the ivy kiss the poet's tomb, Here let the rose he lov'd with laurels bloom, In bands that ne'er shall sever!
But far be thou, oh !
far, unholy vine, By whom the favourite minstrel of the Nine Expir'd his rosy breath ;
Thy god himself now blushes to confess, Unholy vine !
he feels he loves thee less, Since poor Anacreon's death!
There can scarcely be imagined a more delightful theme for the warmest specula- tions of fancy to wanton upon, than the idea of an intercourse between Anacreon and Sappho.
I could wish to believe that they were cotemporary:
any thought of an interchange between hearts so congenial in warmth of passion and delicacy of genius, gives such play to the imagination, that the mind loves to indulge in it;
but the vision dissolves before historical truth;
and Chamæleon and Hermesianax, who are the source of the supposition, are considered as having merely indulged in a poetical anachronism.
*To infer the moral dispositions of a poet from the tone of sentiment which pervades his works, is sometimes a very fallacious analogy:
but the soul of Anacreon speaks so unequivocally through his odes, that we may consult them as the faithful mirrors of his heart.*
We find him there the elegant voluptuary, diffusing the seductive charm of sentiment over passions and propensities at which rigid morality must frown.
His heart, devoted to indolence, seems to think that there is wealth enough in happiness, but seldom happiness enough in wealth;
and the cheerfulness with which he brightens his old age is interesting and endearing:
like his own rose, he is fragrant even in decay.
But the most peculiar feature of his mind is that love of simplicity, which he attributes to himself so very feelingly, and which breathes characteristically through all that he has sung.
In truth, if we omit those vices in our estimate, which ethnic religion not only connived at, but consecrated, we shall say that the disposition of our poet was amiable;
his morality was relaxed, but not abandoned;
and Virtue, with her zone loosened, may be an emblem of the character of Anacreon.
*Of his person and physiognomy time has preserved such uncertain memorials, that perhaps it were better to leave the pencil to fancy;
and few can read the Odes of Anacreon without imagining the form of the animated old bard, crowned with roses, and singing to the lyre;
but the head pre- fixed to this work* has been considered so authentic, that we scarcely could be justified in the omission of it;
and some have thought that it is by no means defici- ent in that benevolent suavity of expression, which should characterize the countenance of such a poet.
After the very enthusiastic eulogiums bestowed by the ancients and moderns upon the poems of Anacreon, we need not be diffident in expressing our raptures at -their beauty, nor hesitate to pronounce them the most polished remains of antiquity.*
They are all beauty, all enchantment.*
He steals us so insensibly along with him, that we sympathize even in his excesses.
In his amatory odes there is a delicacy of compli- ment not to be found in any other ancient poet.
Love, at that period, was rather an unrefined emotion;
and the intercourse of the sexes was animated more by passion than sentiment.
They knew not those little tendernesses which form the spiritual part of affection;
their expression of feeling was therefore rude and unvaried, and the poetry of love deprived of its most capti- vating graces.
Anacreon, however, attained some ideas of this gallantry;
and the same delicacy of mind which led him to this re- finement, prevented him from yielding to the freedom of language, which has sullied the pages of all the other poets.
His descriptions are warm;
but the warmth is in the ideas, not the words.
He is sportive without being wanton, and ardent without being licentious.
His poetic inven- tion is most brilliantly displayed in those allegorical fictions, which so many have endeavoured to imitate, because all have confessed them to be inimitable.
Simplicity is the distinguishing feature of these odes, and they interest by their innocence, while they fascinate by their beauty;
they are, indeed, the infants of the Muses, and may be said to lisp in numbers.
I shall not be accused of enthusiastic par- tiality by those who have read and felt the original;
but to others I am conscious that this should not be the language of a trans- lator, whose faint reflection of these beauties can but little justify his admiration of them.
In the age of Anacreon music and poetry were inseparable.
These kindred talents were for a long time associated, and the poet always sung his own compositions to the lyre.
It is probable that they were not set to any regular air, but rather a kind of musi- cal recitation, which was varied according to the fancy and feelings of the moment.*
The poems of Anacreon were sung at ban- quets as late as the time of Aulus Gellius, who tells us that he heard one of the odes performed at a birth-day entertainment.
*The singular beauty of our poet's style, and perhaps the careless facility with which he appears to have trifled, have induced, as I remarked, a number of imitations.
Some have succeeded with wonderful felicity, as may be discerned in a few odes which are attributed to writers of a later period.
But none of his emulators have been so danger- ous to his fame as those Greek ecclesiastics of the early ages, who, conscious of infe- riority to their prototypes, determined on removing the possibility of comparison, and, under a semblance of moral zeal, destroyed the most exquisite treasures of antiquity.*
Sappho and Alcæus were among the victims of this violation;
and the sweetest flowers of Grecian literature fell beneath the rude hand of ecclesiastical presumption.
It is true they pretended that this sacrifice of genius was canonized by the interests of religion;
but I have already assigned the most probable motive;
† and if Gregorius Nazianzenus had not written Anacreontics, we might now perhaps have the works of the Teian unmutilated, and be empowered to say exultingly with Horace, Nec si quid olim lusit Anacreon Delevit ætas.
The zeal by which these bishops professed to be actuated, gave birth more innocently, indeed, to an absurd species of parody, as repugnant to piety as it is to taste, where the poet of voluptuousness was made a preacher of the gospel, and his muse, like the Venus in armour at Lacedæmon, was arrayed in all the severities of priestly instruction.
Such was the “ Anacreon Recantatus,” by Carolus de Aquino, a Jesuit, published 1701, which consisted of a series of palinodes to the several songs of our poet.
Such too was the Christian Anacreon of Patrignanus, another Jesuit,* who preposterously transferred to a most sacred subject all that Anacreon had sung to festivity.
His metre has been very frequently adopted by the modem Latin poets.
Scaliger, Taubmannus, Barthius,* and others, have evinced, that it is by no means uncongenial with that language.
†
The Anacreontics of Scaliger, however, scarcely deserve the name;
they are glit- tering with conceits, and, though often elegant, are always laboured.
The beauti- ful fictions of Angerianus* have preserved more happily than any the delicate turn of those allegorical fables, which, frequently passing through the mediums of version and imitation, have generally lost their finest rays in the transmission.
Many of the Italian poets have sported on the sub- jects, and in the manner of Anacreon.
Bernardo Tasso first introduced the metre, which was afterwards polished and enriched by Chabriera and others.!
If we may judge by the references of Degen, the German language abounds in Anacreontic imita- tions :
and Hagedorn‡ is one among many who have assumed him as a model.
La Farre, Chaulieu, and the other light poets of France, have professed too to cultivate the muse of Teos;
but they have attained all her negligence with little of the grace that embellishes it.
In the delicate bard of Schiras* we find the kindred spirit of Anacreon:
some of his gazelles, or songs, possess all the character of our poet.
We come now to a retrospect of the editions of Anacreon.
To Henry Stephen we are indebted for having first recovered his remains from the obscurity in which they had reposed for so many ages.
He found the seventh Ode, as we are told, on the cover of an old book, and communicated it to Victorius, who mentions the circum- stance in his “ Various Readings.”
Stephen was then very young;
and this discovery was considered by some critics of that day as a literary imposition.*
In 1554, however he gave Anacreon to the world, t accompa- nied with annotations and a Latin version of the greater part of the odes.
The learned still hesitated to receive them as the relics of the Teian bard, and suspected them to be the fabrication of some monks of the sixteenth century.
This was an idea from which the classic muse recoiled;
and the Vatican MS.
consulted by Scaliger and Salmasius, confirmed the antiquity of most of the poems.
A very inaccurate copy of this MS. was taken by Isaac Vossius, and this is the authority which Barnes has followed in his collation;
accordingly he misrepresents almost as often as he quotes;
and the subsequent editors, relying upon him, have spoken of the manuscript with not less confidence than ignorance.
The literary world has at length been gratified with this curious memorial of the poet, by the industry of the Abbé Spaletti, who, in 1781, published at Rome a fac-simile of the pages of the Vatican manuscript, which contained the odes of Anacreon.
*Monsieur Gall has given a catalogue of all the editions and translations of Anacreon.
I find their number to be much greater than I could possibly have had an opportunity of consulting.
I shall, therefore, content myself with enumerating those editions only which I have been able to collect;
they are very few, but I believe they are the most important.
The edition by Henry Stephen, 1554, at Paris-the Latin version is by Colomesius attributed to John Dorat.
*The old French translations, by Ronsard and Belleau—the former published in 1555, the latter in 1556.
It appears that Henry Stephen communicated his manuscript of Anacreon to Ronsard before he published it, by a note of Muretus upon one of the sonnets of that poet.

I SAW the smiling bard of pleasure, The minstrel of the Teian measure;
'Twas in a vision of the night, He beamed upon my wondering sight;
I heard his voice, and warmly prest The dear enthusiast to my breast.
This ode is the first of the series in the Vatican manuscript, which attributes it to no other poet than Anacreon.
They who assert that the manuscript imputes it to Basilius, have been misled by the words
Τϫ αυτϫ βασιλιϰως in the margin, which are merely intended as a title to the following ode.
Whether it be the production of Anacreon or not, it has all the features of ancient simplicity, and is a beautiful imitation of the poet's happiest manner.
His tresses wore a silvery die, But beauty sparkled in his eye;
Sparkled in his eyes of fire, Through the mist of soft desire.
His lip exhale when'er he sigh'd,
The fragrance of the racy tide;
Sparkled in his eyes of fire, Through the mist of soft desire.] " How could he know at the first look (says Baxter) that the poet was ϕιλευνος?"
There are surely many tell-tales of this propensity;
and the following are the indices, which the physiognomist gives, describing a disposi- tion perhaps not unlike that of Anacreon:
Οϕθαλμοι ϫτε αμϫσιοι. Adamantius. "
The eyes that are humid and fluctuating show a propensity to pleasure and love;
they bespeak too a mind of integrity and beneficence, a generosity of disposition, and a genius for poetry.
"
Baptista Porta tells us some strange opinions of the ancient physiognomists on this subject, their reasons for which were curious, and perhaps not altogether fanciful.
Vide Physiognom.

And, as with weak and reeling feet
He came my cordial kiss to meet, An infant, of the Cyprian band, Guided him on with tender hand.
Quick from his glowing brows he drew
His braid, of many a wanton hue;
I took the braid of wanton twine, It breathed of him and blushed with wine!
I took the braid of wanton twine, It breath'd of him, &c.]
Philostratus has the same thought in one of his Ερωτιϰα, where he speaks of the garland which he had sent to his mistress.
E, to gratify thy lover, send him back the remains of the garland, no longer breathing of roses only, but of thee !"
Which pretty conceit is borrowed (as the author of the Observer remarks) in a well known little song of Ben Jonson's:
"
But thou thereon didst only breathe, " And sent it back to me;
" Since when it looks and smells, I swear, " Not of itself, but thee!"I hung it o'er my thoughtless brow, And ah!
I feel its magic now!
I feel that even his garland's touch Can make the bosom love too much!
And ah!
I feel its magic now!]
This idea, as Longepierre remarks, is in an epigram of the seventh book of the Anthologia.
While I unconscious quaff'd my wine, 'Twas then thy fingers slyly stole Upon my brow that wreath of thine, Which since has madden'd all my soul 1GIVE me the harp of epic song, Which Homer's finger thrilled along;
But tear away the sanguine string, For war is not the theme I sing.
Proclaim the laws of festal rite, I'm monarch of the board to-night;
And all around shall brim as high, And quaff the tide as deep as I!
And when the clusters mellowing dews
Their warm, enchanting balm infuse, Our feet shall catch th' elastic bound, And reel us through the dancers round.
Proclaim the laws of festal rite.]
The ancients prescribed certain laws of drinking at their festivals, for an account of which see the commentators.
Anacreon here acts the symposiarch, or master of the festival.
I have translated according to those, who consider ϰυπελλα ϑεσμων as an inversion
Of ϑεσμϫς ϰυπελλων.
,Oh Bacchus!
we shall sing to thee, In wild but sweet ebriety!
And flash around such sparks of thought, As Bacchus could alone have taught!
Then give the harp of epic song, Which Homer's finger thrilled along;
But tear away the sanguine string, For war is not the theme I sing!
LISTEN to the Muse's lyre, Master of the pencils fire!
Sketched in painting's bold display, Many a city first portray;
Many a city, revelling free, Warm with loose festivity.
Picture then a rosy train, Bacchants straying o'er the plain;
Piping, as they roam along, Roundelay or shepherd-song.
Paint me next, if painting may Such a theme as this portray, All the happy heaven of love, These elect of Cupid prove.
Monsieur La Fosse has thought proper to lengthen this poem by considerable interpolations of his own, which he thinks are indispensably necessary to the completion of the description.
VULCAN!
hear your glorious task;
I do not from your labours ask
In gorgeous panoply to shine, For war was ne'er a sport of mine.
No-let me have a silver bowl, Where I may cradle all my soul;
But let not o'er its simple frame
Your mimic constellations flame;
Nor grave upon the swelling side Orion, scowling o'er the tide.
I care not for the glittering wane, Nor yet the weeping sister train.
But oh!
let vines luxuriant roll
Their blushing tendrils round the bowl.
This is the ode which Aulus Gellius tells us was performed by minstrels at an entertainment where he was present.
While many a rose-lip'd bacchant maid
Is culling clusters in their shade.
Let sylvan gods, in antic shapes, Wildly press the gushing grapes;
And flights of loves, in wanton ringlets, Flit around on golden winglets;
While Venus, to her mystic bower, Beckons the rosy vintage-Power.
While many a rose-lip'd, bacchant maid, &c.]
I have given this according to the Vatican manuscript, in which the ode concludes with the following lines, not inserted accurately in any of the editions:
GRAVE me a cup with brilliant grace, Deep as the rich and holy vase, Which on the shrine of Spring reposes, When shepherds hail that hour of roses.
Grave it with themes of chaste design, Formed for a heavenly bowl like mine.
Display not there the barbarous rites, In which religious zeal delights;
Nor any tale of tragic fate, Which history trembles to relate!
No-cull thy fancies from above, Themes of heav'n and themes of love.
Degen thinks that this ode is a more modern imitation of the preceding.
There is a poem by Cælius Calcagninus, in the manner of both, where he gives instructions about the making of a ring.
Let Bacchus, Jove's ambrosial boy, Distil the grape in drops of joy, And while he smiles at every tear, Let warm ey'd-Venus, dancing near, With spirits of the genial bed, The dewy herbage deftly tread.
Let Love be there, without his arms,
In timid nakedness of charms;
Let Love be there, without his arms, &c.]
Thus Sannazaro in the eclogue of Gallicio nell' Arcadia:
Fluttering on the busy wing, A train of naked Cupids came, Sporting round in harmless ring, Without a dart, without a flame.
And thus in the Pervigilium Veneris:
Ite nymphæ, posuit arma, feriatus est Amor.
Love is disarm'd—ye nymphs, in safety stray, Your bosoms now may boast a holiday!
And all the Graces, linked with Love, Blushing through the shadowy grove;
While rosy boys disporting round, In circlets trip the velvet ground;
But all!
if there Apollo toys, I tremble for my rosy boys!
But ah !
if there Apollo toys, I tremble for my rosy boys!]
An allusion to the fable, that Apollo had killed his beloved boy Hyacinth, while playing with him at quoits. "
This (says M. La Fosse) is assuredly the sense of the text, and it cannot admit of any other.
"The Italian translators, to save themselves the trouble of a note, have taken the liberty of making Anacreon explain this fable.
Thus Salving the most literal of any of them:
As late I sought the spangled bowers, To cull a wreath of matin flowers, Where many an early rose was weeping, I found the urchin Cupid sleeping.
The Vatican MS. pronounces this beautiful fiction to be the genuine offspring of Anacreon.
It has all the features of the parent:
et facile insciis Noscitetur ab omnibus.
The commentators, however, have attributed it to Julian, a royal poet.
Where many an early rose was weeping, I fund the urchin Cupid sfeeping.]
This idea is prettily imitated in the following epigram by Andreas Naugerius:
Florentes dum forte vagans mea Hyella per hortos Texit odoratist lilia cana rosis, Ecce rosas inter latitantem invenit Amorem, Et simul annexisfloribus implicuit.
Luctatur primo, et contra nitentibus alis Indomitus tentat solvere vincta puer,I caught the boy, a goblets tide Was richly mantling by my side, I caught him by his downy wing, And whelm'd him in the racy spring.
As fair Hyella, through the bloomy grove, A wreath of many mingled flowrets wove, Within a rose a sleeping Love she found, And in the twisted wreaths the baby bound.
Awhile he struggled, and impatient tried To break the rosy bonds the virgin tied;
But when he saw her bosom's milky swell, Her features, where the eye of Jove might dwell;
And caught th' ambrosial odours of her hair, Rich as the breathings of Arabian air;
" Oh! mother Venus" (said the raptur'd child, By charms, of more than mortal bloom, beguil'd) "
Go, seek another boy, thou'st lost thine own, " Hyella's bosom shall be Cupid's throne!
"Oh!
then I drank the poison'd bowl, And Love now nestles in In, soul!
Yes, yes, my soul is Cupid's nest, I feel him fluttering in my breast.
THE women tell me every day
That all my bloom has past away.
" Behold," the pretty wantons cry, " Behold this mirror with a sigh;
"
The locks upon thy brow are few, " And, like the rest, they're withering too!"
Whether decline has thinned my hair, I'm sure I neither know nor care;
But this I know, and this I feel, As onward to the tomb I steal,Albert!
has imitated this ode in a poem, beginning Nisa mi dice e Clori Tirsi, tu se' pur veglio.
Whether decline has thinn'd my hair, I'm sure I neither know nor careHenry Stephen very justly remarks the elegant negligence of expression in the original here:
That still as death approaches nearer, The joys of life are sweeter, dearer;
And had I but an hour to live, That little hour to bliss I'd give!
And Longepierre has adduced from Catullus, what he thinks a similar instance of this simplicity of manner:
Ipse quis sit, utrum sit, an non sit, id quoque nescit.
Longepierre was a good critic;
but perhaps the line which he has selected is a specimen of a care- lessness not very elegant;
at the same time I confess, that none of the Latin poets has ever appeared to me so capable of imitating the graces of Anacreon as Catullus, if he had not allowed a depraved imagina- tion to hurry him so often into vulgar licentiousness.
That still as death approaches nearer, The joys of life are sweeter, dearer;

Pontanus has a very delicate thought upon the subject of old age:
Quid rides, Matrona?
senem quid temnis amantem?
Quisquis amat, nullâ est conditioner senex.
Why do you scorn my want of youth, And with a smile my brow behold ?
Lady dear!
believe this truth,
That he who loves cannot be old.
I CARE not for the idle state Of Persians king, the rich, the great!
I envy not the monarches throne, Nor wish the treasured gold my own.

Baxter conjectures that this was written upon the occasion of our poet's returning the money to Poly crates, according to the anecdote in Stobæus.
I care not for the idle stateOf Persia's king, &c.] "
There is a fragment of Archilochus in Plutarch, ' De tranquillitate animi,' which our poet has very closely imitated here;
it begins, Ου μοι τα Γυγεω τϫ ῶολυχρυσϫ μελει."
Barnes.
In one of the monkish imitators of Anacreon we find the same thought:
Be mine the odours, richly sighing, Amidst my hoary tresses flying.
Be mine the odours, richly sighing, Amidst my hoary tresses flying.]
In the original, μυροισι ὑπηνην.
On account of this idea of perfuming the beard, Cornelius de Pauw pronounces the whole ode to be the spurious production of some lascivious monk, who was nursing his beard with unguents.
But he should have known, that this was an ancient eastern custom, which, if we may believe Savary, still exists:
" Vous voyez, Monsieur (says this traveller), que l'usage antique de se parfumer la tête et la barbe,* celebre par le prophete Roi, subsiste encore de nos jours."
Lettre 12.
Savary likewise cites this very ode of Anacreon.
Angerianus has not thought the idea inconsistent:
he has intro- duced it in the following lines:
Hæc mihi cura, rosis et cingere tempera myrto, Et curas multo delapidare mero.
Hæc mihi cura, comas et barbam tingere succo Assyrio et dulces continuare jocos.
This be my care, to twine the rosy wreath, And drench my sorrows in the ample bowl;
To let my beard th' Assyrian unguent breathe, And give a loose to levity of soul!
To-day I'll haste to quaff my wine, As if to-morrow ne'er should shine;
But if to-morrow comes, why then- I'll haste to quaff my wine again.
And thus while all our days are bright, Nor Time has dimmed their bloomy light, Let us the festal hours beguile With mantling cup and cordial smile;
And shed from every bowl of wine
The richest drop on Bacchus' shrine!
For Death may come, with brow unpleasant, May come, when least we wish him present, And beckon to the sable shore, And grimly bid us—drink no more!
I PRAY thee, by the gods above, Give me the mighty bowl I love, And let me sing, in wild delight, " I will—I will be mad to-night!"
Alcmæon once, as legends tell, Was frenzied by the fiends of hell;
Orestes too, with naked tread, Frantic pac'd the mountain-head;
And why ?
a murdered mothers shade Before their conscious fancy played.
The Poet here is in a frenzy of enjoyment, and it is, indeed, " amabilis insania.
"This is, as Scaliger expresses it, Insanire dulce Et sapidum furere furorem.
But I can ne'er a murderer be, The grape alone shall bleed by me;
Yet can I rave, in wild delight, " I will—I will be mad to-night."
The SOIl of Jove, in days of yore, Imbru'd his hands in, youthful gore, And brandish'd, with a maniac joy, The quiver of th' expiring boy:
And Ajax, with tremendous shield, Infuriate scour'd the guiltless field.
But I, whose hands no quiver hold, No weapon but this flask of gold;
The trophy of whose frantic hours
Is but a scattered wreath of flowers;
Yet, yet can sing with wild delight, " I will—I will be mad to-night!"TELL me how to punish thee, For the mischief done to me?

Shall I clip that wheeling wing ?
This ode is addressed to a swallow.
I find from Degen and from Gail's index, that the German poet Weisse has imitated it, Scherz.

that Ramler also has imitated it, Lyr. Blumenlese, lib. iv. p. 335;
and some others.

where Iophon complains to Eraston of being wakened by the crowing of a cock from his vision of riches.
Silly swallow!
prating thing, &c.]
The loquacity of the swallow wa sproverbialized;
thus Nicostratus:
If in prating from morning till night, A sign of our wisdom there be;
The swallows are wiser by right, For they prattle much faster than we.
Or, as Tereus did of old (So the fabled tale is told) Shall I tear that tongue away, Tongue that uttered such a lay?
How unthinking hast thou been!
Long before the dawn was seen,
When I slumbered in a dream, (Love was the delicious theme!)
Just when I was nearly blest, Ah!
thy matin broke my rest!
Or, as Tereus did of old, &c.]
Modern poetry has confirmed the name of Philomel upon the nightin- gale ;
but many very respectable ancients assigned this metamorphose to Progne, and made Philomel the swallow, as Anacreon does here."
TELL me, gentle youth, I pray thee, " What in purchase shall I pay thee "
For this little waxen toy, " Image of the Paphian boy?"
Thus I said the other day, To a youth who passed my way:
" Sir," (he answer'd, and the while Answered all in Doric style,) "
Take it, for a trifle take it;
" Think not yet that I could make it;
" Pray, believe it was not I;
" No-it cost me many a sigh,It is difficult to preserve with any grace the narrative simplicity of this ode, and the humour of the turn with which it concludes.
I feel that the translation must appear very vapid, if not ludicrous, to an English reader."
And I can no longer keep "
Little gods, who murder sleep!" " Here, then, here," (I said with joy,) " Here is silver for the boy:
" He shall be my bosom guest, " Idol of my pious breast!"
Little Love!
thou now art mine, Warm me with that torch of thine;
Make me feel as I have felt, Or thy waxen frame shall melt.
I must burn in warm desire, Or thou, my boy, in yonder fire!
And I can no longer keep, Little gods, who murder sleep!]
I have not literally rendered the epithet ϖαντορεϰτα , if it has any meaning here, it is one, perhaps, better omitted.
I must burn in warm desire, Or thou, my boy, in yonder fire!]
Monsieur Longe- pierre conjectures from this, that, whatever Anacreon might say, he sometimes felt the inconveniences of old age, and here solicits from the power of Love a warmth which he could no longer expect from nature.
THEY tell how Atys, wild with love, Roams the mount and haunted grove;
Cybele's name he howls around, The gloomy blast returns the sound!
Oft too by Claros' hallowed spring, The votaries of the laurell'd kingThey tell how Atys, wild with love, Roams the mount and haunted grove;
]
There are many contradictory stories of the loves of Cybele and Atys.
It is certain that he was mutilated, but whether by his own fury, or her jealousy, is a point which authors are not agreed upon.
Cybele's name he howls around, &c.]
I have adopted the accentuation which Elias Andreas gives to Cybele:
In montibus Cybelen:
Magno sonans boatu.
Oft too by Claros' hallow'd spring, &c]
This foun- tarn was in a grove, consecrated to Apollo, and situated between Colophon and Lebedos, in Ionia.
Quaff the inspiring, magic stream, And rave, in wild prophetic dream.
But frenzied dreams are not for me, Great Bacchus is my deity!
Full of mirth, and full of him,
While waves of perfume round me swim;
While flavoured bowls are full supplied, And you sit blushing by my side, I will be mad and raving too-
Mad, my girl!
with love for you!
The god had an oracle there.
Scaliger has thus alluded to it in his Anacreontica:
While waves of perfume round me swim;
]
Spaletti has mistaken the import of ϰορεθεις, applied to the poet's mistress:
" Mea fatigatus amicâ."
He interprets it, in a sense which must want either delicacy or gallantry.
I WILL;
I will;
the conflicts past, And I'll consent to love at last.
Cupid has long, with smiling art, Invited me to yield my heart;
And I have thought that peace of mind Should not be for a smile resign'd;
And I've repell'd the tender lure, And hop'd my heart should sleep secure.
But, slighted in his boasted charms, The angry infant flew to arms;
He slung his quivers golden frame, He took his bow, his shafts of flame, And proudly summoned me to yield, Or meet him on the martial field.
And what did I unthinking do ?
I took to arms, undaunted too;
And what did I unthinking do ?
I took to arms, undaunted too;
]
Longepierre has quoted an epigram from the Anthologia, in whichAssumed the corslet, shield, and spear, And, like Pelides, smil'd at fear.
the poet assumes Reason as the armour against Love.
With Reason I cover my breast as a shield, And fearlessly meet little Love in the field;
Thus fighting his godship, I'll ne'er be dismayed, But if Bacchus should ever advance to his aid, Alas!
then, unable to combat the two, Unfortunate warrior I what should I do ?
This idea of the irresistibility of Cupid and Bacchus united, is delicately expressed in an Italian poem, which is so very Anacreontic, that I may be pardoned for introducing it.
Indeed, it is an imitation of our poet's sixth ode.
Then (hear it, all you powers above!) I fought with Love!
I fought with Love!
And now his arrows all were shed-
And I had just in terrors fled-
When, heaving an indignant sigh, To see me thus unwounded fly,The urchin of the bow and quiver Was bathing in a neighbouring river, Where, as I drank on yester-eve, (Shepherd-youth!
the tale believe,) 'Twas not a cooling, crystal draught, 'Twas liquid flame I madly quaff'd;
For Love was in the rippling tide, I felt him to my bosom glide.
And now the wily, wanton minion Plays o'er my heart with restless pinion.
This was a day of fatal star, But were it not more fatal far, If, Bacchus, in thy cup of fire, I found this fluttering, young desire?
Then, then indeed my soul should prove, Much more than ever, drunk with love!
And, having now no other dart, He glanced himself into my heart!
My heart-alas the luckless day!
Received the God, and died away.
Farewel, farewel, my faithless shield!
Thy lord at length is forc'd to yield.
Vain, vain, is every outward care, My foe's within, and triumphs there.
And, having left no other dart, He glanc'd himself into my heart !]
Dryden has parodied this thought in the following extravagant lines:
—— I'm all o'er Love;
Nay, I am Love, Love shot, and shot so fast, He shot himself into my breast at last.
COUNT me, on the summer trees, Every leaf that courts the breeze;
Count me, on the foamy deep, Every wave that sinks to sleep;
The poet, in this catalogue of his mistresses, means nothing more, than, by a lively hyperbole, to tell us, that his heart, unfettered by any one object, was warm with devotion towards the sex in general.
Cowley is indebted to this ode for the hint of his ballad, called " The Chronicle;
" and the learned Monsieur Menage has imitated it in a Greek Anacreontic, which has so much ease and spirit, that the reader may not be displeased at seeing it here:
Then, when you have numbered these Billowy tides and leafy trees, Count me all the flames I prove, All the gentle nymphs I love.
Tell the foliage of the woods, Tell the billows of the floods, Number midnight's starry store, And the sands that crowd the shore;
Then, my Bion, thou mayst count Of my loves the vast amount!
I've been loving, all my days, Many nymphs, in many ways,First, of pure Athenian maids Sporting in their olive shades, You may reckon just a score, Nay, I'll grant you fifteen more.
Virgin, widow, maid, and wife— I've been doting all my life.
Naiads,
Nereids, nymphs of fountains, Goddesses of groves and mountains, Fair and sable, great and small, Yes—I swear I've loNd them all!
Every passion soon was over, I was but the moment's lover;
Oh!
I'm such a roving elf.
That the Queen of Love herself, Though she practised all her wiles, Rosy blushes, golden smiles, All her beauty's proud endeavour Could not chain my heart forever!
Count me, on the summer trees, Every leaf, &c.]
This figure is called, by the rhetoricians, αδυιατον, and is very frequently made use of in poetry.
The amatory writers have exhausted a world of imagery by it, to express the infinity of kisses, which they require from the lips of their mistresses:
in this Catullus led the way.
In the sweet Corinthian grove, Where the glowing wantons rove,As many stellar eyes of light, As through the silent waste of night, Gazing upon this world of shade, Witness some secret youth and maid, Who fair as thou, and fond as I, In stolen joys enamoured lie!
So many kisses, ere I slumber, Upon those dew-bright lips I'll number, So many vermil, honied kisses, Envy can never count our blisses.
No tongue shall tell the sum but mine;
No lips shall fascinate, but thine!
In the sweet Corinthian grove, Where the glowing wantons rove, &c.]
Corinth was very famous for the beauty and the number of its courtezans.
Venus was the deity principally worshipped by the people, and prostitution in herChains of beauties may be found, Chains, by which my heart is bound;
There indeed are girls divine, Dangerous to a soul like mine!
Many bloom in Lesbos' isle;
Many in Ionia smile;
Rhodes a pretty swarm can boast;
Caria too contains a host.
temple was a meritorious act of religion.
Conform- able to this was their constant and solemn prayer, that the gods would increase the number of their courtezans.
We may perceive from the application of the verb ϰορινθιαζειν, in Aristophanes, that the wantonness of the Corinthians became proverbial.
There indeed are girls divine, Dangerous to a soul like mine!] " With justice has the poet attributed beauty to the women of Greece."
Degen.
Monsieur de Pauw, the author of Dissertations upon the Greeks, is of a different opinion;
he thinks, that by a capricious partiality of nature, the other sex had all the beauty, and accounts upon this supposition for a very singular deprava- tion of instinct among them.
Sum these all-of brown and fair You may count two thousand there!
What, you gaze!
I pray you, peace!
More I'll find before I cease.
Have I told you all my flames, 'Mong the amorous Syrian dames ?
Have I number'd every one, Glowing under Egypt's sun?
Or the nymphs, who blushing sweet Deck the shrine of Love in Crete;
Where the God, with festal play, Holds eternal holiday?
Still in clusters, still remain Gade's warm, desiring train;
Still there lies a myriad more
On the sable Indians shore;
These, and many far remove All are loving-all are lov'd!
The music of the Gaditanian females had all the voluptuous character of their dancing, as appears from Martial:
Cantica qui Nili, qui Gaditana susurrat.

Ariosto had this ode of our bard in his mind, when he wrote his poem " De diversis amoribus."
See the Anthologia Italorum.TELL me, why, my sweetest dove, Thus your humid pinions move, Shedding through the air in showers Essence of the balmiest flowers ?
The dove of Anacreon, bearing a letter from the poet to his mistress, is met by a stranger, with whom this dialogue is imagined.
The ancients made use of letter-carrying pigeons, when they went any distance from home, as the most certain means of conveying intelligence back.
That tender domestic attachment, which attracts this delicate little bird through every danger and difficulty, till it settles in its native nest, affords to the elegant author of " The Pleasures of Memory" a fine and interesting exemplification of his subject.
Led by what chart, transports the timid dove
The wreaths of conquest, or the vows of love?
See the poem.
Daniel Heinsius has a similar senti- ment, speaking of Dousa, who adopted this method at the siege of Leyden:
Quo patriæ non tendit amor?
Mandata referre Postquam hominem nequiit mittere, misit avem.
Tell me whither, whence you rove, Tell me all, my sweetest dove.
Curious stranger!
I belong To the bard of Teian song;
With his mandate now I fly To the nymph of azure eye;
Ah!
that eye has maddened many, But the poet more than any!

This passage is invaluable, and I do not think that any thing so beautiful or so delicate has ever been said.
What('Twas in sooth a gentle lay,) Gave me to the bard away.
See me now his faithful minion, Thus with softly-gliding pinion, To his lovely girl I bear Songs of passion through the air.
Oft he blandly whispers me, " Soon, my bird, I'll set you free."
But in vain he'll bid me fly, I shall serve him till I die.
Never could my plumes sustain Ruffling winds and chilling rain, O'er the plains, or in the dell, On the mountain's savage swell;
an idea does it give of the poetry of the man, from whom Venus herself, the mother of the Graces and the Pleasures, purchases a little hymn with one of her favourite doves!"
Longepierre.
De Pauw objects to the authenticity of this ode, because it makes Anacreon his own panegyrist;
but poets have a license for praising themselves, which, with some indeed, may be considered as comprised under their general privilege of fiction.
Seeking in the desert wood Gloomy shelter, rustic food.
Now I lead a life of ease, Far from such retreats as these From Anacreon's hand I eat Food delicious, viands sweet;
Flutter o'er his goblets brim, Sip the foamy wine with him.
Then I dance and wanton round
To the lyre's beguiling sound;
Or with gently-fanning wings
Shade the minstrel while he sings:
On his harp then sink in slumbers, Dreaming still of dulcet numbers!
This is all-away-away-
You have made me waste the day.

The lovely maid that's far away.
This ode and the next may be called companion- pictures ;
they are highly finished, and give us an excellent idea of the taste of the ancients in beauty.
Franciscus Junius quotes them in his third book " De Pictura Veterum.
"This ode has been imitated by Ronsard, Giuliano Goselini, &c. See.
Scaliger alludes to it thus in his Anacreontica:
The Teian bard, of former days, Attun'd his sweet descriptive lays, And taught the painter's hand to trace His fair beloved's every grace!
Far away, my soul!
thou art,
But I've thy beauties all by heart.
Paint her jetty ringlets straying, Silky twine in tendrils playing;
In the dialogue of Caspar Barlæus, entitled "
An formosa sit ducenda," the reader will find many curious ideas and descriptions of beauty.
Thou, whose soft and rosy hues Mimic form, and soul infuse;
] I have followed the reading of the Vatican MS.
ϱοδεης.
Painting is called " the rosy art," either in reference to colouring, or as an indefinite epithet of excellence, from the association of beauty with that flower.
Salvini has adopted this reading in his literal translation:
Della rosea arte signore.
The lovely maid that's far away.]
If the portrait of this beauty be not merely ideal, the omission of her name is much to be regretted.
Meleager, in an epigram on Anacreon, mentions " the golden Eurypyle" as his mistress.
Paint her jetty ringlets straying, Silky twine in tendrils playing;
]
The ancients have been very enthusiastic in their praises of hair.
Apuleius, in the second book of his Milesiacs, says,And, if painting hath the skill To make the spicy balm distil, Let every little lock exhale A sigh of perfume on the gale.
that Venus herself, if she were bald, though sur- rounded by the Graces and the Loves, could not be pleasing even to her husband Vulcan.
Stesichorus gave the epithet ϰαλλιπλοϰαμος to the Graces, and Simonides bestowed the same upon the Muses.
See Hadrian Junius's Dissertation upon Hair.
To this passage of our poet, Selden alluded in a note on the Polyolbion of Drayton, song the second, where observing, that the epithet " black-haired" was given by some of the ancients to the goddess Isis, he says, " Nor will I swear, but that Anacreon (a man very judicious in the provoking motives of wanton love), intending to bestow on his sweet mistress that one of the titles of women's special ornament, well-chaired thought of this when he gave his painter direction to make her black-haired.
"And, if painting hath the skill To make the spicy balm distil, &c.]
Thus Philostra- tus, speaking of a picture:
επαινω τον ενδρ
οσον των admire the dewiness of these roses, and could say that their very smell was painted.
"Where her tresses' curly flow Darkles o'er the brow of snow, Let her forehead beam to light, Burnish'd as the ivory bright.
Let her eyebrows sweetly rise
In jetty arches o'er her eyes, Gently in a crescent gliding, Just commingling, just dividing.
But hast thou any sparkles warm, The lightning of her eyes to form?
Let them effuse the azure ray, With which Minerva's glances play, And give them all that liquid fire, That Venus' languid eyes respire.
And give them all that liquid fire, That Venus' languid eyes respire.]
Marchetti explains thus the ὑγρον of the original:
Tasso has painted in the same manner the eyes of Armida, as La Fosse remarks:
O'er her nose and cheek be shed Flushing white and mellowed red;
Gradual tints, as when there glows
In snowy milk the bashful rose.
Within her humid, melting eyes A brilliant ray of laughter lies, Soft as the broken, solar beam, That trembles in the azure stream.
The mingled expression of dignity and tenderness, which Anacreon requires the painter to infuse into the eyes of his mistress, is more amply described in the subsequent ode.
Both descriptions are so exquisitely touched, that the artist must have been great indeed, if he did not yield in painting to the poet.
Gradual tints, as when there glows
In snowy milk the bashful rose.]
Thus Propertius, eleg. 3. lib. ii.
And Davenant, in a little poem called 'The Mistress,' Catch as it falls the Scythian snow, Bring blushing roses steeped in milk.
Then her lip, so rich in blisses!
Sweet petitioner for kisses!
Pouting nest of bland persuasion, Ripely suing Lovers invasion.
Thus too Taygetus:
Quæ lac atque rosas vincis candore rubenti.
These last words may perhaps defend the " flushing white" of the translation.
Then her lift, so rich in blisses!
Sweet petitioner for kisses !]
The " lip, provoking kisses," in the original, is a strong and beautiful expression.
Achilles Tatius speaks of χειλη μαλθαϰα ϖρ
ος τα ϕιληματα " Lips soft and delicate for kissing."
A grave old commentator, Dionysius Lambinus, in his notes upon Lucretius, tells us with all the autho- rity of experience, that girls who have large lips kiss infinitely sweeter than others!
" Suavius viros osculantur puellæ labiosæ, quam quæ sunt brevibus labris."
And Æneas Sylvius, in his tedious uninter- esting story of the adulterous loves of Euryalus and Lucretia, where he particularizes the beauties of the heroine (in a very false and laboured style of latinity), describes her lips as exquisitely adapted, for biting. "
Os parvum decensque, labia corallini coloris ad morsum aptissima."
Epist. 114. lib. i.
Then beneath the velvet chin,
Whose dimple shades a love within, Mould her neck, with grace descending, In a heaven of beauty ending;
While airy charms, above, below, Sport and flutter on its snow.
Now let a floating, lucid veil, Shadow her limbs, but not conceal;
Then beneath the velvet chin, Whose dimple shades a love within, &c.]
Madame Dacier has quoted here two pretty lines of Varro:
In her chin is a delicate dimple, By the finger of Cupid imprest;
There Softness, bewitchingly simple, Has chosen her innocent nest.
Now let a floating, lucid veil, Shadow her limbs, but not conceal;

the imitations of this beautiful poem.
Ronsard is exceptionably minute;
and Politianus, in his charm- ing portrait of a girl, full of rich and exquisite diction, has lifted the veil rather too much.
The " questo che tu m' intendi" should be always left to fancy.
AND now, with all thy pencil's truth, Portray Bathyllus, lovely youth!
Let his hair, in lapses bright, Fall like streaming rays of light;
And there the raven's die confuse With the yellow sunbeam's hues.
The reader, who wishes to acquire an accurate idea of the judgment of the ancients in beauty, will be indulged by consulting Junius de Pictura Veterum, ninth chapter, third book, where he will find a very curious selection of descriptions and epithets of personal perfections;
he compares this ode with a description of Theodoric, king of the Goths, in the second epistle, first book of Sidonius Apollinaris.
Let his hair, in lapses bright, Fall like streaming rays of light;
&c.]
He here describes the sunny hair, " the flava coma," which the ancients so much admired.
The Romans gave this colour artificially to their hair.
See Stanisl.
Kobienzyck de Luxu Romanorum.
Let not the braid, with artful twine, The flowing of his locks confine;
But loosen every golden ring, To float upon the breeze's wing.

If the original here, which is particularly beautiful, can admit of any additional value, that value is conferred by Gray's admiration of it.
See his letters to West.
Some annotators have quoted on this passage the description of Photis's hair in Apuleius;
but nothing can be more distant from the simplicity of our poet's manner, than that affectation of richness which distinguishes the style of Apuleius.
Front, as fair as mountain-snow, And guileless as the dews of dawn, &c.]
Torrentius, upon the words " insignem tenui fronted in the thirty-third ode of the first book of Horace, is of opinion that " tenui" bears the meaning of απαλον here;
but he is certainly incorrect.
Mingle, in his jetty glances, Power that awes, and love that trances;
Mingle, in his jetty glances, Power that awes, and love that trances;
&c.]
Tasso gives a similar character to the eyes of Clorinda:
Her eyes were glowing with a heavenly heat, Emaning fire, and e'en in anger sweet!
The poetess Veronica Cambara is more diffuse upon this variety of expression:
Oh!
tell me, brightly-beaming eye, Whence in your little orbit lie
So many different traits of fire, Expressing each a new desire.
Now with angry scorn you darkle, Now with tender languish sparkle, And we who view the various mirror, Feel at once both hope and terror.
Steal from Venus bland desire, Steal from Mars the look of fire, Blend them in such expression here, That we by turns may hope and fear!
Now from the sunny apple seek
The velvet down that spreads his cheek;
And there let Beauty's rosy ray In flying blushes richly play;
Blushes, of that celestial flame Which lights the cheek of virgin shame.
Then for his lips, that ripely gem—
But let thy mind imagine them!
Paint, where the ruby cell uncloses, Persuasion sleeping upon roses;

In Shakspeare's Cymbeline there is a similar method of description:
———this is his hand, His foot mercurial, his martial thigh, The brawns of Hercules.
Let Bacchus then the breast supply, And Leda's son the sinewy thigh.
But oh!
suffuse his limbs of fire
With all that glow of young desire, Which kindles, when the wishful sigh Steals from the heart, unconscious why.

Longepierre thinks that the hands of Mercury are selected by Anacreon, on account of the graceful gestures which were supposed to characterize the god of eloquence;
but Mercury was also the patron of thieves, and may perhaps be praised as a light-fingered deity.
But oh!
suffuse his limbs of fire With all that glow of young desire, &c.]
I have taken the liberty here of somewhat veiling the original.
Madame Dacier, in her translation, has hung out lights (as Sterne would call it) at this passage.
It is very much to be regretted, that this substitution of asterisks has been so much adopted in the popular interpretations of the Classics;
it serves but to bring whatever is exceptionable into notice, " claramque facem præferre pudendis.
"Which now in veiling shadow lies, Removed from all but Fancy's eyes.
Now, for his feet-but hold-forbear- I see a godlike portrait there;
So like Bathyllus!—sure there's none So like Bathyllus but the sun!
Oh!
let this pictured god be mine, And keep the boy for Samos' shrine;
Phœbus shall then Bathyllus be, Bathyllus then the deity!
—But hold—forbear— I see a godlike portrait there;
&c.]
This is very spirited, but it requires explanation.
While the artist is pursuing the portrait of Bathyllus, Anacreon, we must suppose, turns round and sees a picture of Apollo, which was intended for an altar at Samos;
he instantly tells the painter to cease his work;
that this picture will serve for Bathyllus;
and that, when he goes to Samos, he may make an Apollo of the portrait of the boy which he had begun."
Bathyllus (says Madame Dacier) could not be more elegantly praised, and this one passage does him more honour than the statue, however beautiful it might be, which Polycrates raised to him.
"Now the star of day is high, Fly, my girls, in pity fly, Bring me wine, in brimming urns, Cool my lip, it burns, it bums!
Sunned by the meridian fire, Panting, languid I expire!
Give me all those humid flowers, Drop them o'er my brow in showers."
An elegant translation of this ode may be found in Ramler's Lyr. Blumenlese, lib. v. p. 403." Degen.
Bring me wine, in brimming urns, &c.]
Orig. ϖιειν αμυςι. "
The amystis was a method of drinking used among the Thracians.
Thus Horace, Threïciâ vincat amystide."
Mad. Dacier, Longepierre, &c. &c.Parrhasius, in his 26th epistle (Thesaur. Critic, vol. i.) explains the amystis as a draught to be exhausted without drawing breath," uno haustu."
A note in the margin of this epistle of Parrhasius says, " Politianus vestem esse putabat," but I cannot find where.
Give me all those humid flowers, &c.]
By the origi- nal reading of this line, the poet says, " Give me theScarce a breathing chaplet now Lives upon my feverish brow;
Every dewy rose I wear Sheds its tears, and withers there.
flower of wine"—Date flosculos Lyæi, as it is in the version of Elias Andreas;
and Deh porgetimi del fiore Di quel almo e buon liquore, as Regnier has it, who supports the reading.
Ανθος would undoubtedly bear this application, which is somewhat similar to its import in the epigram of Simonides upon Sophocles:
And flos in the Latin is frequently applied in this man- ner :
thus Cethegus is called by Ennius, Flos inlibatus populi, suadæque medulla, " The immaculate flower of the people, and the very marrow of persuasion, in those verses cited by Aulus Gellius, lib. xii. which Cicero praised, and Seneca thought ridiculous.
But in the passage before us, if we admit εϰεινων, ac- cording to Faber's conjecture, the sense is sufficiently clear, and we need not have recourse to refinements.
Every dewy rose I wear Sheds its tears, and withers there.]
There are some beautiful lines, by Angerianus, upon a garland, which I cannot resist quoting here:
But for you, my burning mind!
Oh!
what shelter shall I find?
Can the bowl, or flowret's dew, Cool the flame that scorches you ?
By Cellars arbour all the night Hang, humid wreath, the lovers vow;
And haply, at the morning light, My love shall twine thee round her brow.
Then, if upon her bosom bright Some drops of dew shall fall from thee, Tell her, they are not drops of night, But tears of sorrow shed by me!
In the poem of Mr. Sheridan's, " Uncouth is this moss-covered grotto of stone," there is an idea very singularly coincident with this of Angerianus, in the stanza which begins, And thou, stony grot, in thy arch mayst preserve.
But for you, my burning mind! &c.]
The transition here is peculiarly delicate and impassioned;
but the commentators have perplexed the sentiment by a variety of readings and conjectures.
HERE recline you, gentle maid, Sweet is this imbowering shade;
Sweet the young, the modest trees, Ruffled by the kissing breeze;
The description of this bower is so natural and animated, that we cannot help feeling a degree of coolness and freshness while we read it.
Longepierre has quoted from the first book of the Anthologia, the following epigram, as somewhat resembling this ode:
Come, sit by the shadowy pine
That covers my sylvan retreat;
And see how the branches incline
The breathing of zephyr to meet.
See the fountain, that, flowing, diffuses Around me a glittering spray;
By its brink, as the traveller muses, I sooth him to.
sleep with my lay!
Sweet the little founts that weep, Lulling bland the mind to sleep;
Hark!

reads βαθυλλϨ, which renders the whole poem metaphorical.
Some commentator suggests the read- ing of βαθυλλον, which makes a pun upon the name;
a grace that Plato himself has condescended to in writing of his boy αςης.
See the epigram of this, philosopher, which I quote on the twenty-second ode.
There is another epigram by this philosopher, preserved in Laertius, which turns upon the same word.
In life thou wert my morning-star, But now that death has stol'n thy light, Alas!
thou shinest dim and far, Like the pale beam that weeps at night.
In the Veneres Blyenburgicæ, under the head of " allusiones," we find a number of such frigid conceits upon names, selected from the poets of the middle ages.
Tell me, tell me, is not this All a stilly scene of bliss?
Who, my girl, would pass it by?
Surely neither you nor I!
Who, my girl, would pass it by?
Surely neither you nor I!]
What a finish he gives to the picture by the simple exclamation of the original!
In these delicate turns he is inimitable;
and yet, hear what a French translator says on the passage:
" This conclusion appeared to me too trifling after such a description, and I thought proper to add somewhat to the strength of the original.
ONE day, the Muses twin'd the hands
Of baby Love, with flow'ry bands;
And to celestial Beauty gave
The captive infant as her slave.
By this allegory of the Muses making Cupid the prisoner of Beauty, Anacreon seems to insinuate the softening influence which a cultivation of poetry has over the mind, in making it peculiarly suscepti- ble to the impressions of beauty.
Though in the following epigram, by the philoso- pher Plato, which is found in the third book of Diogenes Laertius, the Muses are made to disavow all the influence of Love."
Yield to my gentle power, Parnassian maids
Thus to the Muses spoke the Queen of Charms;
" Or Love shall flutter in your classic shades, And make your grove the camp of Paphian arms !
"His mother comes with many a toy, To ransom her beloved boy;
" No," said the virgins of the tuneful bower, " We scorn thine own and all thy urchin's art;
Though Mars has trembled at the infants power, His shaft is pointless o'er a Muse's heart!
"There is a sonnet by Benedetto Guidi, the thought of which was suggested by this ode.
His mother sues, but all in vain !
He ne'er will leave his chains again.
Love, wandering through the golden maze
Of my beloved's hair, Traced every lock with fond delays, And, doting, lingered there.
And soon he found 'twere vain to fly, His heart was close confin'd;
And every curlet was a tie, A chain by Beauty twin'd.
Now Venus seeks her boy's release, With ransom from above:
But, Venus!
let thy efforts cease, For Love's the slave of love.
And, should we loose his golden chain, The prisoner would return again!
His mother comes, with many a toy, To ransom her beloved boy;
&c.]
Venus thus proclaims the reward for her fugitive child in the first idyll of Moschus:
Nay, should they take his chains away, The little captive still would stay. "
If this," he cries, " a bondage be, " Who could wish for liberty,.
On him, who the haunts of my Cupid can show, A kiss of the tenderest stamp I'll bestow;
But he, who can bring me the wanderer here, Shall have something more rapturous, something more dear.
This " something more" is the quidquid post oscula dulce of Secundus.
After this ode, there follow in the Vatican MS.
these extraordinary lines:
These lines, which appear to me to have as little sense as metre, are most probably the interpolation of the transcriber.
OBSERVE when mother earth is dry, She drinks the droppings of the sky;
And then the dewy cordial gives
To ev'ry thirsty plant that lives.
The commentators who have endeavoured to throw the chains of precision over the spirit of this beautiful trifle, require too much from Anacreontic philosophy.
Monsieur Gail very wisely thinks that the poet uses the epithet μελαινη, because black earth absorbs moisture more quickly than any other;
and accordingly he indulges us with an experimental disquisition on the subject.
See Gail's notes.
One of the Capilupi has imitated this ode, in an epitaph on a drunkard:
The vapours, which at evening weep, Are beverage to the swelling deep;
And when the rosy sun appears, He drinks the ocean's misty tears.
While life was mine, the little hour
In drinking still unvaried flew;
I drank as earth imbibes the shower, Or as the rainbow drinks the dew;
As ocean quaffs the rivers up, Or flushing sun inhales the sea:
Silenus trembled at my cup, And Bacchus was outdone by me!
I cannot omit citing those remarkable lines of Shakspeare, where the thoughts of the ode before us are preserved with such striking similitude:
I'll example you with thievery.
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea.
The moon's an arrant thief, And her pale fire she snatches from the sun.
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The mounds into salt tears.
The earth's a thief, That feeds, and breeds by a composture stol'n From general excrements.
The moon too quaffs her paly stream
Of lustre, from the solar beam.
Then, hence with all your sober thinking!
Since Nature's holy law is drinking;
I'll make the laws of nature mine, And pledge the universe in wine!
THE Phrygian rock, that braves the storm, Was once a weeping matrons form;
And Progne, hapless, frantic maid, Is now a swallow in the shade.
Ogilvie, in his Essay on the Lyric Poetry of the Ancients, in remarking upon the Odes of Anacreon, says, " In some of his pieces there is exuberance and even wildness of imagination;
in that particularly, which is addressed to a young girl, where he wishes alternately to be transformed to a mirror, a coat, a stream, a bracelet, and a pair of shoes, for the different purposes which he recites:
this is mere sport and wantonness.
"It is the wantonness however of a very graceful Muse;
ludit amabiliter.
The compliment of this ode is exquisitely delicate, and so singular for the period in which Anacreon lived, when the scale of love had not yet been graduated into all its little progressive refinements, that if we were inclined to question the authenticity of the poem, we should find a much more plausible argument in the features of modern gallantry which it bears, than in anyOh!
that a mirror's form were mine, To sparkle with that smile divine;
And like my heart I then should be, Reflecting thee, and only thee!
of those fastidious conjectures upon which some commentators have presumed so far.
Degen thinks it spurious, and De Pauw pronounces it to be miserable.
Longepierre and Barnes refer us to several imitations of this ode, from which I shall only select an epigram of Dionysius:
I wish I could like zephyr steal To wanton o'er thy mazy vest;
And thou wouldst ope thy bosom-veil, And take me panting to thy breast!
I wish I might a rose-bud grow, And thou wouldst cull me from the bower, And place me on that breast of snow, Where I should bloom, a winterv flower.
Or were I, love, the robe which flows
O'er every charm that secret glows, In many a lucid fold to swim, And cling and grow to every limb!
I wish I were the lily's leaf, To fade upon that bosom warm;
There I should wither, pale and brief, The trophy of thy fairer form!
Allow me to add, that Plato has expressed as fanciful a wish in a distich preserved by Laertius:
Why dost thou gaze upon the sky ?
Oh!
that I were that spangled sphere,
And every star should be an eye, To wonder on thy beauties here!
Apuleius quotes this epigram of the divine philo- sopher, to justify himself for his verses on Critias and Charinus.
See his Apology, where he also adduces the example of Anacreon ;
" Fecere tamen et alii talia, et si vos ignoratis, apud Græces Teius quidam, &c. &c."Oh!
could I, as the streamlet's wave, Thy warmly-mellowing beauties lave, Or float as perfume on thine hair, And breathe my soul in fragrance there!
I wish I were the zone, that lies Warm to thy breast, and feels its sighs!
Or like those envious pearls that show So faintly round that neck of snow, Yes, I would be a happy gem, Like them to hang, to fade like them.
I wish I were the zone, that lies Warm to thy breast, and feels its sighs!]
This ταινιη was a riband, or band, called by the Romans fascia and strophium, which the women wore for the purpose of restraining the exuberance of the bosom.
Vide Polluc.
Onomast.
Thus Martial:
The women of Greece not only wore this zone, but condemned themselves to fasting, and made use of certain drugs and powders, for the same purpose.
To these expedients they were compelled, in consequence of their inelegant fashion of com- pressing the waist into a very narrow compass, which necessarily caused an excessive tumidity in the bosom.
See Dioscorides, lib. v.
What more would thy Anacreon be ?
Oh!
any thing that touches thee.
Nay, sandals for those airy feet—
Thus to be pressed by thee were sweet!

The sophist Philostratus, in one of his love-letters, has borrowed this thought;
ω αδετοι ω̃οδες ω ϰαλλος ελευθρος ω τρι- σευδαιμων εγω ϰαι μαϰαριος εαν ω̃ατησετε με. "
Oh lovely feet!
oh excellent beauty!
oh!
thrice happy and blessed should I be, if you would but tread on me!"
In Shakspeare, Romeo desires to be a glove:
Oh!
that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might kiss that cheek!
And, in his Passionate Pilgrim, we meet with an idea somewhat like that of the thirteenth line:
He, spying her, bounced in, where as he stood, " 0 Jove!" quoth she, " why was not I a flood?
"In Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, that whim- sical farrago of " all such reading as was never read," there is a very old translation of this ode, before 1632.
" Englished by Mr. B. Holiday in his Technog.

But when the soaring theme I try, Along the chords my numbers die,This ode is first in the series of all the editions, and is thought to be peculiarly designed as an intro- duction to the rest;
it however characterizes the genius of the Teian but very inadequately, as wine, the burden of his lays, is not even mentioned in it.
The twenty-sixth ode συ μεν λεγεις τα Θηης, might, with as much propriety, be the harbinger of his songs.
Bion has expressed the sentiments of the ode before us with much simplicity in his fourth idyll.
I have given it rather paraphrastically;
it has been so frequently translated, that I could not otherwise avoid triteness and repetition.
And whisper, with dissolving tone, " Our sighs are given to love alone!"
Indignant at the feeble lay, I tore the panting chords away, Attuned them to a nobler swell, And struck again the breathing shell;
In all the glow of epic fire, To Hercules I wake the lyre!
But still its fainting sighs repeat, " The tale of love alone is sweet!
"But still its fainting sighs repeat," The tale of love alone is sweet!"]
The word αντε- ϕωνει, in the original, may imply that kind of musical dialogue practised by the ancients, in which the lyre was made to respond to the questions proposed by the singer.
This was a method which Sappho used, as we are told by Hermogenes:
" όταν την λυραν ερωτ
αThen fare thee well, seductive dream, That mad'st me follow Glory's theme;
For thou my lyre, and thou my heart, Shall never more in spirit part;
And thou the flame shalt feel as well
As thou the flame shalt sweetly tell!
To all that breathe the airs of heaven, Some boon of strength has Nature given.
When the majestic bull was born, She fenced his brow with wreathed horn.
Henry Stephen has imitated the idea of this ode in the following lines of one of his poems:
And the same thought occurs in those lines, spoken by Corisca in Pastor Fido:
The lion boasts his savage powers,
And lordly man his strength of mind;
But beauty's charm is solely ours, Peculiar boon, by heaven assigned!
She arm'd the coursers foot of air, And winged with speed the panting hare.
She gave the lion fangs of terror, And, on the ocean's crystal mirror, Taught the unnumbered scaly throng To trace their liquid path along;
While for the umbrage of the grove, She plumed the warbling world of love.
To man she gave the flame retina
The spark of heav'n—a thinking mind!
To man she gave the flame refined, The spark of heav'n—a thinking mind!]
In my first attempt to translate this ode, I had interpreted ϕρονημα, with Baxter and Barnes, as implying courage and military virtue;
but I do not think that the gallantry of the idea suffers by the import which I have now given to it.
For, why need we consider this posses- sion of wisdom as exclusive?
and in truth, as the design of Anacreon is to estimate the treasure ofAnd had she no surpassing treasure, For thee, oh woman!
child of pleasure?
She gave thee beauty-shaft of eyes, That every shaft of war outflies!
She gave thee beauty-blush of fire, That bids the flames of war retire!
beauty, above all the rest which Nature has distri- buted, it is perhaps even refining upon the delicacy of the compliment, to prefer the radiance of female charms to the cold illumination of wisdom and prudence;
and to think that women's eyes are—— the books, the academies, From whence cloth spring the true Promethean fire.
She gave thee beauty—shaft of eyes, That every shaft of war outflies !]
Thus Achilles ερωτιϰω τραυματι. " Beauty wounds more swiftly than the arrow, and passes through the eye to the very soul;
for the eye is the inlet to the wounds of love.
"Woman!
be fair, we must adore thee;
Smile, and a world is weak before thee!
Woman!
be fair, we must adore thee;
Smile, and a world is weak before thee!]
Longe- pierre's remark here is very ingenious:
" The Romans," says he, " were so convinced of the power of beauty, that they used a word implying strength in the place of the epithet beautiful.
Thus Plautus, act 2. scene 2. Bacchid.ONCE in each revolving year, Gentle bird!

When Nature wears her summer vest, Thou com'st to weave thy simple nest;
But when the chilling winter lowers, Again thou seek'st the genial bowers Of Memphis, or the shores of Nile, Where sunny hours of verdure smile.

Thus Love is represented as a bird, in an epigram cited by Longepierre from the Anthologia:
That linger in this hapless breast, And never, never change their nest!
Still every year, and all the year, A flight of loves engender here;
And some their infant plumage try, And on a tender winglet fly;
'Tis Love that murmurs in my breast, And makes me shed the secret tear;
Nor day nor night my heart has rest, For night and day his voice I hear.
A wound within my heart I find, And oh!
'tis plain where Love has been;
For still he leaves a wound behind, Such as within my heart is seen.
Oh bird of Love!
with song so drear, Make not my soul the nest of pain;
Oh!
let the wing which brought thee here, In pity waft thee hence again!
While in the shell, impregn'd with fires, Cluster a thousand more desires;
Some from their tiny prisons peeping, And some in formless embryo sleeping.
My bosom, like the vernal groves, Resounds with little warbling loves;
One urchin imps the others feather, Then twin-desires they wing together, And still as they have learned to soar, The wanton babies teem with more.
But is there then no kindly art, To chase these cupids from my heart?
No, no!
I fear, alas!
I fear They will forever nestle here!
THY harp may sing of Troy's alarms, Or tell the tale of Theban arms;
With other wars my song shall burn, For other wounds my harp shall mourn.
'Twas not the crested warriors dart, Which drank the current of my heart;
Nor naval arms, nor mailed steed, Have made this vanquished bosom bleed;
No-from an eye of liquid blue, A host of quiver'd cupids flew;

Longepierre has quoted part of an epigram from the seventh book of the Anthologia, which has a fancy something like this:
And now my heart all bleeding lies Beneath this army of the eyes!
Archer Love!
though slily creeping, Well I know where thou dost lie;
I saw thee through the curtain peeping, That fringes Zenophelia's eye.
The poets abound with conceits on the archery of the eyes, but few have turned the thought so naturally as Anacreon.
Ronsard gives to the eyes of his mistress " un petit camp d'amours"WE read the flying coursers name Upon his side, in marks of flame;
And, by their turban'd brows alone, The warriors of the east are known.
But in the lover's glowing eyes, The inlet to his bosom lies;
This ode forms a part of the preceding in the Vatican MS.
but I have conformed to the editions in translating them separately."
Compare with this (says Degen) the poem of Ramler Wahrzeichen der Liebe, in Lyr. Blumen- lese, lib. iv. p. 313."But in the lover's glowing eyes, The inlet to his bosom lies"
We cannot see into the hearty says Madame Dacier.
But the lover answers-Monsieur La Fosse has given the following lines, as enlarging on the thought of Anacreon:
Through them we see the small faint mark, Where Love has dropped his burning spark!
In vain the lover tries to veil
The flame which in his bosom lies;
His cheeks' confusion tells the tale, We read it in his languid eyes:
And though his words the heart betray, His silence speaks e'en more than they.
As in the Lemnian caves of fire, The mate of her who nursed desire Moulded the glowing steel, to form Arrows for Cupid, thrilling warm;
While Venus every barb imbues With droppings of her honied dews;
And Love (alas the victim-heart!)
Tinges with gall the burning dart;
This ode is referred to by La Mothe le Vayer, who, I believe, was the author of that curious little work, called ' Hexameron Rustique.'
He makes use of this, as well as the thirty-fifth, in his ingenious but indelicate explanation of Hornets Cave of the Nymphs.

Thus Claudian:
Once, to this Lemnian cave of flame, The crested Lord of battles came;
In Cyprus' isle two rippling fountains fall, And one with honey flows, and one with gall:
In these, if we may take the tale from fame, The son of Venus dips his darts of flame.
See the ninety-first emblem of Alciatus, on the close connexion which subsists between sweets and bitterness.
Apes ideo pungunt (says Petronius) quia ubi dulce, ibi et acidum invenies.
The allegorical description of Cupid's employ- ment, in Horace, may vie with this before us in fancy, though not in delicacy:
And Cupid, sharpening all his fiery darts, Upon a whetstone stain'd with blood of hearts.
Secundus has borrowed this, but has somewhat softened the image by the omission of the epithet " cruenta."
'Twas from the ranks of war he rush'd, His spear with many a life-drop blushed!
He saw the mystic darts, and smil'd Derision on the archer-child. "
And dost thou smile?" said little Love;
"
Take this dart, and thou mayst prove, " That though they pass the breeze's flight, " My bolts are not so feathery light."
He took the shaft—and oh!
thy look, Sweet Venus!
when the shaft he took-
He sighed, and felt the urchin's art;
He sigh'd, in agony of heart, " It is not light—I die with pain! " Take-take thy arrow back again.,, " No," said the child, " it must not be, " That little dart was made for thee!
"YES—loving is a painful thrill, And not to love more painful still;
Yes—loving is a painful thrill, And not to love more painful still;

Monsieur Menage, in the allowing Anacreontic, enforces the necessity of loving.
But surely 'tis the worst of pain, To love and not be lov'd again!
Affection now has fled from earth, Nor fire of genius, light of birth,Thou!
of tuneful bards the first, Thou!
by all the graces nurst;
Friend!
each other friend above, Come with me, and learn to love.
Loving is a simple lore, Graver men have leaned before;
Nay, the boast of former ages, Wisest of the wisest sages,Nor heavenly virtue, can beguile From beauty's cheek one favouring smile.
Gold is the woman's only theme, Gold is the woman's only dream.
Sophroniscus' prudent son, Was by lovers illusion won, Oh!
how heavy life would move, If we knew not how to love!
Lovers a whetstone to the mind;
Thus 'tis pointed, thus refined.
When the soul dejected lies, Love can waft it to the skies;
When in languor sleeps the heart, Love can wake it with his dart;
When the mind is dull and dark, Love can light it with his spark.
Come, oh!
come then, let us haste
All the bliss of love to taste;
Let us love both night and day, Let us love our lives away!
And when hearts, from loving free, (If indeed such hearts there be,) Frown upon our gentle flame, And the sweet delusion blame;
This shall be my only curse, (Could I, could I wish them worse?)
May they ne'er the rapture prove
Of the smile from lips we love!
Oh!
never be that wretch forgiven-
Forgive him not, indignant heaven!
Whose grovelling eyes could first adore, Whose heart could pant for sordid ore.
Since that devoted thirst began, Man has forgot to feel for man;
The pulse of social life is dead, And all its fonder feelings fled!
War too has sullied Nature's charms, For gold provokes the world to arms!
And oh!
the worst of all its art, I feel it breaks the lover's heart!

TWAS in an airy dream of night, I fancied, that I winged my flight
On pinions fleeter than the wind, While little Love, whose feet were twined (I know not why) with chains of lead, Pursued me as I trembling fled;
Pursued-and could I e'er have thought ?—
Swift as the moment I was caught!
What does the wanton Fancy mean
By such a strange, illusive scene ?
I fear she whispers to my breast, That you, my girl, have stolen my rest;
Barnes imagines from this allegory, that our poet married very late in life.
I do not perceive any thing in the ode which seems to allude to matrimony, except it be the lead upon the feet of Cupid;
and I must confess that I agree in the opinion of Madame Dacier, in her life of the poet, that he was always too fond of pleasure to marry.
That though my fancy, for a while, Has hung on many a woman's smile, I soon dissolved the passing vow, And ne'er was caught by love till now!
ARM'D with hyacinthine rod, (Arms enough for such a god, Cupid bade me wing my pace, And try with him the rapid race.
The design of this little fiction is to intimate, that much greater pain attends insensibility than can ever result from the tenderest impressions of love.
Longepierre has quoted an ancient epigram (I do not know where he found it), which has some similitude to this ode:
O'er the wild torrent, rude and deep, By tangled brake and pendent steep, With weary foot I panting flew, My brow was chill with drops of dew.
Upon my couch I lay, at night profound, My languid eyes in magic slumber bound, When Cupid came and snatched me from my bed, And forc'd me many a weary way to tread. " What!" said the god, " shall you, whose vows are known, " Who love so many nymphs, thus sleep alone?"
I rise and follow;
all the night I stray, Unshelter'd, trembling, doubtful of my way.
Tracing with naked foot the painful track, Loth to proceed, yet fearful to go back.
Yes, at that hour, when Nature seems interred, Nor warbling birds, nor lowing flocks are heard;
I, I alone, a fugitive from rest, Passion my guide, and madness in my breast, Wander the world around, unknowing where, The slave of love, the victim of despair!
And now my soul, exhausted, dying, To my lip was faintly flying;
And now I thought the spark had fled, When Cupid hovered o'er my head,My brow was chill with drops of dew.]
I have followed those who read τειρεν ίδρως for ω̃ειρεν ὐδρος;
the former is partly authorised by the MS.
which reads ω̃ειρεν ἱδρως.
And now my soul, exhausted, dying, To my lift was faintly flying;

In the original, he says, his heart flew to his nose;
but our manner more naturally transfers it to the lips.
Such is the effect that Plato tells us he felt from a kiss, in a distich, quoted by Aulus Gellius:
Whenever thy nectar'd kiss I sip, And drink thy breath, in melting twine, My soul then flutters to my lip, Ready to fly and mix with thine.
Aulus Gellius subjoins a paraphrase of this epi- gram, in which we find many of those mignardises of expression, which mark the effemination of the Latin language.
And fanning light his breezy plume, Recall'd me from my languid gloom;
Then said, in accents half-reproving, " Why hast thou been a foe to loving?

The facility with which Cupid recovers him, signifies that the sweets of love make us easily forget any solicitudes which he may occasion."

None but Love should fill the goblet of Anacreon.
Sappho has assigned this office to Venus, in a fragment.
Which may be thus paraphrased:
Hither Venus!
queen of kisses,
This shall be the night of blisses!
This the night, to friendship dear, Thou shalt be our Hebe here.
Fill the golden brimmer high, Let it sparkle like thine eye!
Bid the rosy current gush, Let it mantle like thy blush!
In this delicious hour of joy, Young Love shall be my goblet-boy;
Folding his little golden vest, With cinctures, round his snowy breast, Himself shall hover by my side, And minister the racy tide!
Swift as the wheels that kindling roll, Our life is hurrying to the goal:
A scanty dust, to feed the wind, Is all the trace 'twill leave behind.
Why do we shed the resets bloom
Upon the cold, insensate tomb ?
Can flowery breeze, or odour's breath, Affect the slumbering chill of death ?
Venus!
hast thou e'er above Seen a feast so rich in love ?
Not a soul that is not mine!
Not a soul that is not thine!"

Anacreon appears to have been a voluptuary even in dreaming, by the lively regret which he expresses at being disturbed from his visionary enjoyments.

" I pray thee," said the wanton child, (My bosom trembled as he smil'd,) " I pray thee let me try my bow, " For through the rain I've wander'd so, " That much I fear, the ceaseless shower "
Has injur'd its elastic power."
The fatal bow the urchin drew;
Swift from the string the arrow flew;
Oh!
swift it flew as glancing flame, And to my very soul it came! "
Fare thee well," I heard him say, As laughing wild he wing'd away;
" Fare thee well, for now I know "
The rain has not relaxed my bow;

It still can send a madd'ning dart, " As thou shalt own with all thy heart!

And chirp thy song with such a glee, That happiest kings may envy thee!
Whatever decks the velvet field, Whatever the circling seasons yield, Whatever buds, whatever blows, For thee it buds, for thee it grows.
Nor yet art thou the peasants fear, To him thy friendly notes are dear;
For thou art mild as matin dew, And still, when summery flowery hue Begins to paint the bloomy plain, We hear thy sweet, prophetic strain;
See what Licetus says about grasshoppers, cap. 93 and 185.
And chirp, tlzy song with such a glee, &c.] " Some authors have affirmed (says Madame Dacier), that it is only male grasshoppers which sing, and that the females are silent;
and on this circumstance is founded a bon-mot of Xenarchus, the comic poet, who says ειτ' εισιν ὁι τεττιγες Ϩϰ ευδαιμονες, ὡν ταις γυναιξιν Ϩδ' ὁυι Ϩν ϕωνης ενι;
' are not the grasshoppers happy in having dumb wives'?"
This note is originally Henry Stephen's;
but I chose rather to make Madame Dacier my authority for it.
Thy sweet, prophetic strain we hear, And bless the notes and thee revere!
The Muses love thy shrilly tone;
Apollo calls thee all his own;
'Twas he who gave that voice to thee, 'Tis he who tunes thy minstrelsy.
Unworn by age's dim decline, The fadeless blooms of youth are thine.
Melodious insect!
child of earth!
In wisdom mirthful, wise in mirth;
The Muses love thy shrilly tone;

calls this insect ΜϨσαις ϕιλος, the darling of the Muses, and ΜϨσων ορνιν, the bird of the Muses;
and we find Plato compared for his eloquence to the grasshopper, in the following punning lines of Timon, preserved by Diogenes Laertius:
This last line is borrowed from Homer's Iliad, γ. where there occurs the very same simile.
Exempt from every weak decay,
That withers vulgar frames away;
With not a drop of blood to stain
The current of thy purer vein;
So blest an age is passed by thee, Thou seem'st—a little deity!
Melodious insect!
child of earth!]
Longepierre has quoted the two first lines of an epigram of Antipater, from the first book of the Anthologia, where he prefers the grasshopper to the swan:
In dew, that drops from mornings wings, The gay Cicada sipping floats;
And drunk with dew his matin sings Sweeter than any cygnet's notes.
CUPID once upon a bed
Of roses laid his weary head;
Luckless urchin, not to see Within the leaves a slumbering bee!
Theocritus has imitated this beautiful ode in his nineteenth idyll, but is very inferior, I think, to his original, in delicacy of point and naivete of expres- sion.
Spencer, in one of his smaller compositions, has sported more diffusely on the same subject.
The poem to which I allude, begins thus:
Upon a day, as Love lay sweetly slumbering All in his mothers lap;
A gentle bee, with his loud trumpet murmuring, About him flew by hap, &c &c.
In Almeloveen's collection of epigrams, there is one by Luxorius, correspondent somewhat with the turn of Anacreon, where Love complains to his mother of being wounded by a rose.
The ode before us is the very flower of simplicity.
The infantine complainings of the little god, andThe bee awak'd—with anger wild
The bee awak'd, and stung the child.
the natural and impressive reflection which they draw from Venus, are beauties of inimitable grace.
I hope I shall be pardoned for introducing another Greek Anacreontic of Monsieur Menage, not for its similitude to the subject of this ode, but for some faint traces of this natural simplicity, which it appears to me to have preserved:
Loud and piteous are his cries;
To Venus quick he runs, he flies! " Oh mother!
—I am wounded through- " I die with pain-in sooth I do!
As dancing o'er the enamell'd plain, The flowret of the virgin train, My soul's Corinna lightly played, Young Cupid saw the graceful maid;
He saw, and in a moment flew, And round her neck his arms he threw;
And said, with smiles of infant joy, " Oh!
kiss me, mother, kiss thy boy!"
Unconscious of a mothers name, The modest virgin blush'd with shame!
And angry Cupid, scarce believing
That vision could be so deceiving, Thus to mistake his Cyprian dame, The little infant blush'd with shame. " Be not asham'd, my boy" I cried, For I was lingering by his side, " Corinna and thy lovely mother, " Believe me, are so like each other, " That clearest eyes are oft betrayed, " And take thy Venus for the maid.
"Zitto, in his Cappriciosi Pensieri, has translated this ode of Anacreon."
Stung by some little angry thing, " Some serpent on a tiny wing- " A bee it was—for once, I know " I heard a rustic call it so."
Thus he spoke, and she the while Heard him with a soothing smile;
Then said, " My infant, if so much "
Thou feel the little wild-bee's touch, " How must the heart, ah Cupid!
be, " The hapless heart that's stung by thee!"IF hoarded gold possessed a power To lengthen lifers too fleeting hour, And purchase from the hand of death A little span, a moments breath, How I would love the precious ore!
And every day should swell my store;
That when the Fates would send their minion, To waft me off on shadowy pinion,Monsieur Fontenelle has translated this ode, in his dialogue between Anacreon and Aristotle in the shades, where he bestows the prize of wisdom upon the poet."
The German imitators of it are, Lessing, in his poem ' Gestern Brüder, &c.' Gleim, in the ode ' An den Tod,' and Schmidt, in der Poet.

The com- mentators, who are so fond of disputing " de lanâ caprinâ," have been very busy on the authority ofI might some hours of life obtain, And bribe him back to hell again.
But, since we ne'er can charm away
The mandate of that awful day, Why do we vainly weep at fate, And sigh for lifers uncertain date?
The light of gold can ne'er illume
The dreary midnight of the tomb!
And why should I then pant for treasures ?
Mine be the brilliant round of pleasures;
The goblet rich, the board of friends, Whose flowing souls the goblet blends!
the phrase ἱν ἀν ϑανειν επελθη.
The reading of ἱν ἀν Θανατος επελθη, which De Medenbach proposes in his Amœnitates Litterariæ, was already hinted by Le Fevre, who seldom suggests any thing worth notice.
The goblet rich, the hoard of friends, Whose flowing souls the goblet blends !]
This com- munion of friendship, which sweetened the bowl of Anacreon, has not been forgotten by the author of the following scholium, where the blessings of life are enumerated with proverbial simplicity.
'Υγιαινειν
Mine be the nymph, whose form reposes Seductive on that bed of roses;
And oh!
be mine the souPs excess, Expiring in her warm caress!
Of mortal blessings here, the first is health, And next, those charms by which the eye we move;
The third is wealth, unwounding guiltless wealth, And then, an intercourse with those we love!'TWAS night, and many a circling bowl
Had deeply warmed my swimming soul;
As lull'd in slumber I was laid, Bright visions o'er my fancy played!"
Compare with this ode the beautiful poem ' der Traum' of Uz." Degen.
Monsieur Le Fevre, in a note upon this ode, enters into an elaborate and learned justification of drunk- enness ;
and this is probably the cause of the severe reprehension, which I believe he suffered for his Anacreon.
" Fuit olim fateor (says he in a note upon Longinus), cum Sapphonem amabam.
Sed ex quo illa me perditissima fœmina pene miserum perdidit cum sceleratissimo suo congerrone (Anacreontem dieD, si nescis, Lector), noli sperare, &c. &c."
He adduces on this ode the authority of Plato, who allowed ebriety, at the Dionysian festivals, to men arrived at their fortieth year.
He likewise quotes the following line from Alexis, which he says no one, who is not totally ignorant of the world, can hesitate to confess the truth of:
" No lover of drinking was ever a vicious man.
"With virgins, blooming as the dawn, I seemed to trace the opening lawn;
Light, on tiptoe bathed in dew, We flew, and sported as we flew!
Some ruddy striplings, young and sleek, With blush of Bacchus on their cheek, Saw me trip the flowery wild With dimpled girls, and slyly smiled;
Smil'd indeed with wanton glee, But, ah!
'twas plain they envied me.
And still I flew—and now I caught
The panting nymphs, and fondly thought To kiss-,,-hell all my dream of joys, Dimpled girls and ruddy boys,—when all my dream of joys, Dimpled girls and ruddy boys, All were gone!] " Nonnus says of Bacchus, almost in the same words that Anacreon uses, Waking, he lost the phantom's charms, He found no beauty in his arms;
Again to slumber he essay'd, Again to clasp the shadowy maid!
Longepierre.
All were gone! " Alas!"
I said, Sighing for th' illusions fled, " Sleep!
again my joys restore, " Oh!
let me dream them o'er and o'er!"," Sleep !
again my joys restore, " OIl!
let me dream them o'er and o'er!"]
Doctor Johnson, in his preface to Shakspeare, animadverting upon the commentators of that poet, who pretended, in every little coincidence of thought, to detect an imitation of some ancient poet, alludes in the follow- ing words to the line of Anacreon before us:
"I have been told that when Caliban, after a pleasing dream, says, ' I cried to sleep again,' the author imitates Anacreon, who had, like any other man, the same wish on the same occasion."
LET us drain the nectar'd bowl, Let us raise the song of soul To him, the God who loves so well The nectar'd bowl, the choral swell!
Him, who instructs the sons of earth
To thrid the tangled dance of mirth;
Him, who was nursed with infant Love, And cradled in the Paphian grove;
Him, that the snowy Queen of Charms Has fondled in her twining arms."
Compare with this beautiful ode the verses of Hagedorn, lib. v. das Gesellschaftliche;
and of Bürger, p. 51, &c. &c." Degen.
Him, that the snowy Queen of Charms Has fondled in her twining arms.']
Robertellus, upon the epithalamium of Catullus, mentions an ingenious derivation of Cytherea, the name of Venus, ω̃αρα το ϰευθειν τϨς ερωτας, which seems to hint that " Love's fairy favours are lost when not concealed.
"From him that dream of transport flows, Which sweet intoxication knows;
With him, the brow forgets to darkle, And brilliant graces learn to sparkle.
Behold!
my boys a goblet bear, Whose sunny foam bedews the air.
Where are now the tear, the sigh?
To the winds they By, they fly!
Grasp the bowl;
in nectar sinking, Man of sorrow, drown thy thinking!
Oh!
can the tears we lend to thought
In lifers account avail us aught ?
Can we discern, with all our lore, The path we're yet to journey o'er?
No, no!
the walk of life is dark;
'Tis wine alone can strike a spark!
No, no !
the walk of life is dark;
'Tis wine alone can strike a spark!']
The brevity of life allows arguments for the voluptuary as well as the moralist.
Among many parallel passages which Longepierre has adduced, I shall content myself with this epigram from the Anthologia:
Then let me quaff the foamy tide, And through the dance meandering glide;
Let me imbibe the spicy breath
Of odours chafed to fragrant death;
Or from the kiss of love inhale A more voluptuous, richer gale!
Of which the following is a loose paraphrase:
Fly, my beloved?
to yonder stream, We'll plunge us from the noontide beam;
Then cull the rose's humid bud, And dip it in our goblet's flood.
Our age of bliss, my nymph, shall fly, As sweet, though passing, as that sigh, Which seems to whisper o'er your lip, " Come, while you may of rapture sip."
For age will steal the rosy form,
And chill the pulse, which trembles warm !
And death-alas!
that hearts, which thrill
Like yours and mine, should e'er be still!
To souls, that court the phantom Care, Let him retire and shroud him there;
While we exhaust the nectar'd bowl,
And swell the choral song of soul To him, the God who loves so well The nectar'd bowl, the choral swell!
How I love the festive boy, Tripping wild the dance of joy!
How I love the mellow sage, Smiling through the veil of age!
And whene'er this man of years
In the dance of joy appears, Age is on his temples hung, But his heart-his heart is young!
Age is on his temples hung, But his heart—his heart is young!]
Saint Pavin makes the same distinction in a sonnet to a young girl:
Fair and young, thou bloomest now, And I full many a year have told;
But read the heart and not the brow, Thou shalt not find my love is old;
My lovers a child;
and thou canst say How much his little age may be, For he was born the very day
That first I set my eyes on thee!
I KNOW that Heaven ordains me here, To run this mortal lifers career;
The scenes which I have joumied o'er, Return no more-alas!
no more;
And all the path I've yet to go, I neither know nor ask to know.
Then surely, Care, thou canst not twine
Thy fetters round a soul like mine;
No, no!
the heart that feels with me, Can never be a slave to thee!
No, no !
the heart that feels with me, Can never be a slave to thee Longepierre quotes an epigram here from the Anthologia, on account of the similarity of a particular phrase;
it is by no means Anacreontic, but has an interesting simplicity, which induced me to paraphrase it, and may atone for its intrusion.
And oh!
before the vital thrill,
Which trembles at my heart, is still, I'll gather Joy's luxuriant flowers, And gild with bliss my fading hours;
Bacchus shall bid my winter bloom, And Venus dance me to the tomb!
At length to Fortune, and to you, Delusive Hope!

The charm that once beguiled is o'er, And I have reached my destined shore!
Away, away!
your flattering arts May now betray some simpler hearts,
And you will smile at their believing, And they shall weep at your deceiving!
Bacchus shall bid my winter bloom, And Venus dance me to the tomb!]
The same commentator has quoted an epitaph, written upon our poet by Julian, where he makes him give the precepts of good fellowship even from the tomb.
This lesson oil in life I sung, And from my grave I still shall cry, " Drink, mortal!
drink, while time is young, " Ere death has made thee cold as I."WHEN Spring begems the dewy scene, How sweet to walk the velvet green, And hear the Zephyrs languid sighs, As o'er the scented mead he flies!
How sweet to mark the pouting vine, Ready to fall in tears of wine;
And with the maid, whose every sigh
Is love and bliss, entranced to lie
Where the imbowering branches meet-
Oh!
is not this divinely sweet?
And with the maid, whose every sigh
Is love and bliss, &c.]
Thus Horace:
And does there then remain but this,
And hast thou lost each rosy ray Of her, who breath'd the soul of bliss, And stole me from myself away!
YES, be the glorious revel mine, Where humour sparkles from the wine!
Around me, let the youthful choir Respond to my beguiling lyre;
The character of Anacreon is here very strikingly depicted.
His love of social, harmonized pleasures, is expressed with a warmth, amiable and endearing.
Among the epigrams imputed to Anacreon is the following;
it is the only one worth translation, and it breathes the same sentiments with this ode:
When to the lip the brimming cup is prest, And hearts are all afloat upon the stream;
Then banish from my board th' unpolished guest, Who makes the feats of war his barbarous theme.
But bring the man, who o'er his goblet wreathes The Muse's laurel with the Cyprian flower;
Oh!
give me him, whose heart expansive breathes
All the refinements of the social hour.
And while the red cup circles round, Mingle in soul as well as sound!
Let the bright nymph, with trembling eye, Beside me all in blushes lie;
And, while she weaves a frontlet fair Of hyacinth to deck my hair, Oh!
let me snatch her sidelong kisses, And that shall be my bliss of blisses!
My soul, to festive feeling true, One pang of envy never knew;
And little has it learned to dread
The gall that envy's tongue can shed.
Away—I hate the slanderous dart, Which steals to wound the unwary heart;
And oh!
I hate, with all my soul, Discordant clamours o'er the bowl, Where every cordial heart should be Attuned to peace and harmony.
Come, let us hear the soul of song
Expire the silver harp along;
And through the dancers ringlet move, With maidens mellowing into love;
Thus simply happy, thus at peace, Sure such a life should never cease!
WHILE our rosy fillets shed Blushes o'er each fervid head, With many a cup and many a smile
The festal moments we beguile.
And while the harp, impassion'd, flings Tuneful rapture from the strings, Some airy nymph, with fluent limbs, Through the dance luxuriant swims,And while the harp, impassion'd) flings Tuneful rapture from the strings, &c.]
On the barbiton an host of authorities may be collected, which, after all, leave us ignorant of the nature of the instrument.
There is scarcely any point upon which we are so totally uninformed as the music of the ancients.
The authors,.
extant upon the subject, are, I imagine, little understood;
but certainly if one of their moods was a progression by quarter-tones, which we are told was the nature of the enharmonicWaving, in her snowy hand, The leafy Bacchanalian wand, Which, as the tripping wanton flies, Shakes its tresses to her sighs!
A youth the while, with loosened hair, Floating on the listless air, Sings, to the wild harp's tender tone, A tale of woes, alas!
his own;
And then, what nectar in his sigh, As o'er his lip the murmurs die!
scale, simplicity was by no means the characteristic of their melody;
for this is a nicety of progression, of which modern music is not susceptible.
The invention of the barbiton is, by Athenxus, attributed to Anacreon.
See his fourth book, where it is called TO έυρημα τϨ Αναϰρεοντος. Neanthes of Cyzicus, as quoted by Gyraldus, asserts the same.
Vide Chabot. in Horat. on the words " Lesboum barbiton," in the first ode.
And then, what nectar in his sigh, As o'er his lip the murmurs die!]
Longepierre has quoted here an epigram from the Anthologia:
Surely never yet has been So divine, so blest a scene!
Has Cupid left the starry sphere, To wave his golden tresses here ?
Of which the following may give some idea:
The kiss that she left on my lip, Like a dew-drop shall lingering lie;
'Twas nectar she gave me to sip, 'Twas nectar I drank in her sigh!
The dew that distill'd in that kiss, To my soul was voluptuous wine;
Ever since it is drunk with the bliss, And feels a delirium divine!
Has Cupid left the starry sphere, To wave his golden tresses here ?]
The introduction of these deities to the festival is merely allegorical.
Madame Dacier thinks that the poet describes a masquerade, where these deities were personated by the company in masks.
The translation will conform with either idea.
Oh yes!
and Venus, queen of wiles, And Bacchus, shedding rosy smiles, All, all are here, to hail with me The genius of festivity!
All, all are here, to hail with me
The genius of festivity !]
Κωμος, the deity or genius of mirth.
Philostratus, in the third of his pictures (as all the annotators have observed), gives a very beautiful description of this god.
BUDS of roses, virgin flowers, Cull'd from Cupid's balmy bowers, In the bowl of Bacchus steep, Till with crimson drops they weep!
Twine the rose, the garland twine, Every leaf distilling wine;
Drink and smile, and learn to think
That we were born to smile and drink.
This spirited poem is an eulogy on the rose;
and again, in the fifty-fifth ode, we shall find our author rich in the praises of that flower.
In a fragment of Sappho, in the romance of Achilles Tatius, to which Barnes refers us, the rose is very elegantly styled " the eye of Bowers and the same poetess, in another fragment, calls the favours of the Muse " the roses of Pieria."
See the notes on the fifty- fifth ode."
Compare with this forty-fourth ode (says the German annotator) the beautiful ode of Uz die Rose."Rose!
thou art the sweetest flower
That ever drank the amber shower;
Rose!
thou art the fondest child
Of dimpled Spring, the wood-nymph wild!
Even the Gods, who walk the sky, Are amorous of thy scented sigh.

a This sweet idea of Love dancing with the Graces, is almost peculiar to Anacreon."

The epithet βαθυϰολπος, which he gives to the nymph, is literally " full-bosomed:
" if this was really Anacreon's taste, the heaven of Mahomet would suit him in every particular.
See the Koran, cap. 72.
While gales of roses round me rise, In perfume, sweetened by her sighs, I'll bill and twine in airy dance, Commingling soul with every glance!
WITHIN this goblet, rich and deep, I cradle all my woes to sleep.
Why should we breathe the sigh of fear, Or pour the unavailing tear?
For death will never heed the sigh, Nor soften at the tearful eye;
And eyes that sparkle, eyes that weep, Must all alike be seal'd in sleep;
Then let us never vainly stray, In search of thorns, from pleasure's way;
Then let us never vainly stray, In search of thorns, from pleasure's way;
&c.]
I have thus endeavoured to convey the meaning of τι δε τον βιον ω̃λανωμαι;
according to Regnier's paraphrase of the line:
Oh!
let us quaff the rosy wave, Which Bacchus loves, which Bacchus gave;
And in the goblet, rich and deep, Cradle our crying woes to sleep!
SEE the young, the rosy Spring, Gives to the breeze her spangled wing;
While virgin Graces, warm with May, Fling roses o'er her dewy way!
The fastidious affectation of some commentators has denounced this ode as spurious.
Degen pro- nounces the four last lines to be the patch-work of some miserable versificator, and Brunck condemns the whole ode.
It appears to me to be elegantly graphical;
full of delicate expressions and luxuriant imagery.
The abruptness of 'Ιδε ω̃ως εαρ
ος ϕανεντος is striking and spirited, and has been imitated rather languidly by Horace;
Vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte
The imperative ιδε is infinitely more impressive, as in Shakspeare, But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill.
There is a simple and poetical description of Spring, in Catullus's beautiful farewel to Bithynia.
Carm. 44.
The murmuring billows of the deep
Have languish'd into silent sleep;
And mark!
the flitting sea-birds lave
Their plumes in the reflecting wave;
Barnes conjectures, in his life of our poet, that this ode was written after he had returned from Athens, to settle in his paternal seat at Teos;
there, in a little villa at some distance from the city, which commanded a view of the Ægean Sea and the islands, he contemplated the beauties of nature and enjoyed the felicities of retirement.
Vide Barnes, in Anac. vita, § xxxv.
This supposition, however unauthenticated, forms a pleasant association, which makes the poem more interesting.
Monsieur Chevreau says, that Gregory Nazian- zenus has paraphrased somewhere this description of Spring;
I cannot find it.
See Chevreau CEuvres Melees."
Compare with this ode (says Degen) the verses of Hagedorn, book fourth der Frühling, and book fifth der Mai.
"While virgin Graces, Warm with May, Fling roses o'er her dewy way /]
De Pauw reads, Χρς ςοδ βςv8σlυ, " the roses display their graces."
This is not uningenious;
but we lose by it the beauty of the personification, to the boldness of which Reg- nier has objected, very frivolously.
While cranes from hoary winter fly To flutter in a kinder sky.
Now the genial star of day Dissolves the murky clouds away;
And cultured field, and winding stream, Are sweetly tissued by his beam.
Now the earth prolific swells
With leafy buds and flowery bells;
Gemming shoots the olive twine, Clusters ripe festoon the vine;
All along the branches creeping, Through the velvet foliage peeping, Little infant fruits we see Nursing into luxury!

Ασxος was a kind of leathern vessel for wine, very much in use, as should seem by the proverb ατxος;
xαι Ϥυλαxος, which was applied to those who were intemperate in eating and drinking.
This proverb is mentioned in some verses quoted by Athenæus, from the He- sione of Alexis.
The only thyrsus e'er I'll ask!]
Phornutus assigns as a reason for the consecration of the thyrsus to Bacchus, that inebriety often renders the support of a stick very necessary.
Let those, who pant for Glory's charms, Embrace her in the field of arms;
While my inglorious, placid soul Breathes not a wish beyond the bowl.
Then fill it high, my ruddy slave, And bathe me in its honied wave!
For though my fading years decay, And though my bloom has passed away, Like old Silenus, sire divine, With blushes borrowed from my wine, I'll wanton 'mid the dancing train, And live my follies all again!
WHEN my thirsty soul I steep, Every sorrow's lulled to sleep.
Talk of monarchs!

On my velvet couch reclining, Ivy leaves my brow entwining, While my soul dilates with glee, What are kings and crowns to me ?
Ivy leaves my brow entwining, &c.] " The ivy was consecrated to Bacchus (says Montfaucon), because he formerly lay hid under that tree, or, as others will have it, because its leaves resemble those of the vine."
Other reasons for its consecration, and the use of it in garlands at banquets, may be found in Longepierre, Barnes, See. &c.
If before my feet they lay, I would spurn them all away!
Arm you, arm you, men of might, Hasten to the sanguine fight;

This, the preceding ode, and a few more of the same character, are merely chansons a boire.
Most likely they were the effusions of the moment of con- viviality, and were sung, we imagine, with rapture in Greece;
but that interesting association, by which they always recalled the convivial emotions that produced them, can be very little felt by the most enthusiastic reader;
and much less by a phlegmatic grammarian, who sees nothing in them but dialects and particles.
Who, with the sunshine of the bowl, Thaws the winter of our soul;
&c. ]
Λvαιος is the title which he gives to Bacchus in the original.
It is a curious circumstance, that Plutarch mistook the name of Levi among the Jews for Αευï(one of the bacchanal cries), and accordingly supposed that they worshipped Bacchus.
-When to my inmost core he glides, And bathes it with his ruby tides, A flow of joy, a lively heat, Fires my brain, and wings my feet!
'Tis surely something sweet, I think, Nay, something heavenly sweet, to drink!
Sing, sing of love, let music's breath Softly beguile our rapturous death, While, my young Venus, thou and I To the voluptuous cadence die!
Then waking from our languid trance, Again we'll sport, again we'll dance.
WHEN I drink, I feel, I feel, Visions of poetic zeal!
Warm with the goblet's fresh'ning dews, My heart invokes the heavenly muse.
Faber thinks this spurious;
but, I believe, he is singular in his opinion.
It has all the spirit of our author.
Like the wreath which he presented in the dream, " it smells of Anacreon.
"The form of this ode, in the original, is remark- able.
It is a kind of song of seven quatrain stanzas, each beginning with the line
The first stanza alone is incomplete, consisting but of three lines."
Compare with this poem (says Degen) the verses of Hagedorn, lib. v. der Wein, where that divine poet has wantoned in the praises of wine.
"When I drink, I feel, Ifeel, Visions of pœtic zeal!] " Anacreon is not the only one (says Longepierre), whom wine has inspiredWhen I drinks my sorrow's o'er;

Could our poet imagine such bombast as the following ?
Venus!
I breathe my vows to thee, In many a sigh of luxury!
When I drink, my heart refines,
And rises as the cup declines;
Rises in the genial flow, That none but social spirits know, When youthful revellers, round the bowl, Dilating, mingle soul with soul!
When I drink, the bliss is mine;
There's bliss in every drop of wine!
When youthful revellers, round the bowl, Dilating, mingle soul with soul!]
Subjoined to Gail's edition of Anacreon, there are some curious letters upon the θιαοι of the ancients, which appeared in the French Journals.
At the opening of the Odeon in Paris, the managers of the spectacle requested Professor Gail to give them some uncommon name for the fêtes of this institution.
He suggested the word " Thiase," which was adopted;
but the literati of Paris questioned the propriety of it, and addressed their criticisms to Gail through the medium of the public prints.
Two or three of the letters he has inserted in his edition, and they have elicited from him some learned research on the subject.
All other joys that I have known, I've scarcely dar'd to call my own;
But this the Fates can ne'er destroy, Till death overshadows all my joy!
FLY not thus my brow of snow, Lovely wanton!
fly not so.
Though the wane of age is mine, Though the brilliant flush is thine,Albert!
has imitated this ode;
and Capilupus, in the following epigram, has given a version of it:
Oh!
why repel my soul's impassioned vow, And fly, beloved maid, these longing arms?
Is it, that wintry time has strew'd my brow, And thine are all the summers roseate charms ?
See the rich garland, culled in vernal weather, Where the young rosebud with the lily glows;
In wreaths of love we thus may twine together, And I will be the lily, thou the rose!
Still I'm doomed to sigh for thee, Blest, if thou couldst sigh for me!
See, in yonder flowery braid, Cull'd for thee, my blushing maid, How the rose, of orient glow, Mingles with the lily's snow;
Mark, how sweet their tints agree, Just, my girl, like thee and me!
See, in yonder flowery braid, Cull'd for thee, my blushing maid,] " In the same manner that Anacreon pleads for the whiteness of his locks, from the beauty of the colour in garlands, a shepherd, in Theocritus, endeavours to recommend his black hair:
Longepierre, Barnes, &c.A WAY, away, you men of rules, What have I to do with schools ?
They'd make me learn, they'd make me think, But would they make me love and drink drink?
Teach me this;
and let me swim
My soul upon the goblets brim;
"
This is doubtless the work of a more modern poet than Anacreon:
for at the period when he lived rhetoricians were not known."
Degen.
Though the antiquity of this ode is confirmed by the Vatican manuscript, I am very much inclined to agree in this argument against its authenticity;
for though the dawnings of rhetoric might already have appeared, the first who gave it any celebrity was Corax of Syracuse, and he flourished in the century after Anacreon.
Our poet anticipated the ideas of Epicurus, in his aversion to the labours of learning, as well as his devotion to voluptuousness.
πασαv ωαιδεlα μαxαρlol ϕευγετε, said the philosopher of the garden in a letter to Pythocles.
Teach me this, and let me twine
My arms around the nymph divine!
Age begins to blanch my brow, I've time for nought but pleasure now.
Fly, and cool my goblets glow
At yonder fountain's gelid flow;
I'll quaff, my boy, and calmly sink
This soul to slumber as I drink!
Soon, too soon, my jocund slave, You'll deck your master's grassy grave;
Teach me this, and let me twine
My arms around the nymph divine!]
By χρμσης Αϕροδιτης here, I understand some beautiful girl, in the same manner that Λυαιος is often used for wine.
" Golden" is frequently an epithet of beauty.
Thus in Virgil, " Venus aurea;
" and in Propertius, " Cynthia aurea."
Tibullus, however, calls an old woman, " golden.
"The translation d'Autori Anonimi, as usual, wantons on this passage of Anacreon:
And there's an end-for ah!
you know
They drink but little wine below!
And there's an end-for ah !

They drink but little wine below!]
Thus the witty Mainard:
From Mainard, Gombauld, and De Cailly, old French poets, some of the best epigrams of the English language are borrowed.
When I behold the festive train
Of dancing youth, I'm young again!
Memory wakes her magic trance, And wings me lightly through the dance.
Come, Cybeba, smiling maid!

Licetus, in his Hieroglyphica, quoting two of our poet's odes, where he calls for garlands, remarks," Constat igitur floreas coronas poetis et potantibus in symposia convenire non autem sapientibus et philosophiam affectantibus."-"
It appears that wreaths of flowers were adapted for poets and revellers at banquets, but by no means became those who had pretensions to wisdom and philosophy."
On this principle, in his 152d chapter, he discovers a refinement in Virgil, describing the garland of the poet Silenus as fallenAnd let me, while the wild and young Trip the mazy dance along, Fling my heap of years away, And be as wild, as young as they.

He still can chant the festive hymn, He still can kiss the goblets brim;

which distinguishes, he thinks, the divine intox- ication of Silenus from that of common drunkards, who always wear their crowns while they drink.
This, indeed, is the " labor ineptiarum" of com- mentators.
He still can kiss the goblet's brim;

Wine is prescribed by Galen, as an excellent medicine for old men. " Quod frigidos et humoribus expletos calefaciat, &c." but Nature was Anacreon's physician.
There is a proverb in Eriphus, as quoted by Athensæs, which says, " that wine makes an old man dance whether he will or not.
"He still can act the mellow raver, And play the fool as sweet as ever!
METHINKS, the pictured bull we see Is amorous Jove-it must be he!
How fondly blest he seems to bear
That fairest of Phœnician fair!
How proud he breasts the foamy tide, And spurns the billowy surge aside!"
This ode is written upon a picture which repre- sented the rape of Europa."
Madame Dacier.
It may perhaps be considered as a description of one of those coins, which the Sidonians struck off in honour of Europa, representing a woman carried across the sea by a bull.
Thus Natalis Comes, lib. viii. cap. 23. " Sidonii numismata cum foemina tauri dorso insidente ac mare transfretante, cuderunt in ejus honorem."
In the little treatise upon the goddess of Syria, attributed very falsely to Lucian, there is mention of this coin, and of a temple dedi- cated by the Sidonians to Astarte, whom some, it appears, confounded with Europa.
Moschus has written a very beautiful idyll on the story of Europa.
Could any beast, of vulgar vein, Undaunted thus defy the main ?
No:
he descends from climes above, He looks the God, he breathes of Jove!
No:
he descends from climes above, He looks the God, he breathes of Jove /]
Thus Moschus:
The God forgot himself, his heaven, for love, And a bull's form belied th'almighty Jove.
WHILE we invoke the wreathed spring, Resplendent rose!
to thee we'll sing;
Resplendent rose, the flower of flowers, Whose breath perfumes Olympus, bowers;
This ode is a brilliant panegyric on the rose.
" All antiquity (says Barnes) has produced nothing more beautiful.
"From the idea of peculiar excellence, which the ancients attached to this flower, arose a pretty pro- verbial expression, used by Aristophanes, according to Suidas, ςοδα " You have spoken roses," a phrase somewhat similar to the " dire des fleu- rettes" of the French.
In the same idea of excellence originated, I doubt not, a very curious application of the word ςοδοv, for which the inquisitive reader may consult Gaulminus upon the epithalamium of our poet, where it is introduced in the romance of Theo- dorus.
Muretus, in one of his elegies, calls his mistress his rose:
Jam te igitur rursus teneo, formosula, jam te (Quid trepidas?) teneo;
jam, rosa, te teneo.
Eleg. 8.Whose virgin blush, of chastened dye, Enchants so much our mortal eye.
When pleasure's bloomy season glows, The Graces love to twine the rose;
Now I again embrace thee, dearest, (Tell me, wanton, why thou fearest?)
Again my longing arms infold thee, Again, my rose, again I hold thee.
This, like most of the terms of endearment in the modern Latin poets, is taken from Plautus;
they were vulgar and colloquial in his time, and they are among the elegancies of the modern Latinists.
Passeratius alludes to the ode before us, in the beginning of his poem on the Rose:
Resplendent rose!
to thee we'll sing;
] I have pas- sed over the line συν εταιρει, αυξει μελπην;
it is corrupt in this original reading, and has been very little im- proved by the annotators.
I should suppose it to be an interpolation, if it were not for a line which occurs afterwards:
θερεδη ϕνσιν λεγωμεν.
The rose is warm Dione's bliss, And flushes like Dione's kiss!
Oft has the poet's magic tongue
The resets fair luxuriance sung;
The rose is warm Dione's bliss, &c] Belleau, in a note upon an old French poet, quoting the original here αϕροδιςιων τ'αθυρμα, translates it, " comme les delices et mignardises de Venus.
"Oft has the poet's magic tongue
The rose's fair luxuriance sung;
&c.]
The fol- lowing is a fragment of the Lesbian poetess.
It is cited in the Romance of Achilles Tatius, who appears to have resolved the numbers into prose.
EtIf Jove would give the leafy bowers
A queen for all their world of flowers,
The rose would be the choice of Jove, And blush, the queen of every grove.
Sweetest child of weeping morning, Gem, the vest of earth adorning, Eye of flowrets, glow of lawns, Bud of beauty, nurs'd by dawns:
And long the Muses, heavenly maids, Have reared it in their tuneful shades.
When, at the early glance of morn, It sleeps upon the glittering thorn, 'Tis sweet to dare the tangled fence, To cull the timid flowret thence, And wipe with tender hand away The tear that on its blushes lay!
'Tis sweet to hold the infant stems, Yet dropping with Aurora's gems, And fresh inhale the spicy sighs
That from the weeping buds arise.
When revel reigns, when mirth is high, And Bacchus beams in every eye, Our rosy fillets scent exhale, And fill with balm the fainting gale!
Soft the soul of love it breathes, Cypria's brow with magic wreaths, And, to the Zephyrs warm caresses, Diffuses all its verdant tresses, Till, glowing with the wanton's play, It blushes a diviner ray!
Oh!
there is nought in nature bright, Where roses do not shed their light!
When morning paints the orient skies, Her fingers burn with roseate dres;
The nymphs display the resets charms, It mantles o'er their graceful arms;
Through Cytherea's form it glows, And mingles with the living snows.
The rose distils a healing balm, The beating pulse of pain to calm;
Preserves the cold inurned clay, And mocks the vestige of decay.
When morning paints the orient skies, Her fingers burn with roseate dies;
&c.]
In the original here, he enumerates the many epithets of beauty, borrowed from roses, which were used by the poets, Των σοϕων.
We see that poets were dignified in Greece with the title of sages:
even the careless Anacreon, who lived but for love and volup- tuousness, was called by Plato the wise Anacreon.
Fui.t hæc sapientia quondam.
Preserves the cold inurned clay, &c.]
He here alludes to the use of the rose in embalming;
and, perhaps (as Barnes thinks), to the rosy unguent withAnd when at length, in pale decline, Its florid beauties fade and pine,which Venus anointed the corpse of Hector.
Ho- mer's Iliad ψ.
It may likewise regard the ancient practice of putting garlands of roses on the dead, as in Statius, Theb. lib. x. 782.
Where " veris honor," though it mean every kind of flowers, may seem more particularly to refer to the rose, which our poet in another ode calls ἐχρ
ος μελημα.
We read, in the Hieroglyphics of Pierius, lib.
Iv.
that some of the ancients used to order in their wills, that roses should be annually scattered on their tombs, and he has adduced some sepulchral inscriptions to this purpose.
And mocks the vestige of decay.]
When he says that this flower prevails over time itself, he still alludes to its efficacy in embalment (tenera poneret ossa rosa.
Propert. lib. i. eleg. 17), or perhaps to the subsequent idea of its fragrance surviving its beauty;
for he can scarcely mean to praise for du- ration the , nimium breves flores" of the rose.
Phi- lostratus compares this flower with love, and says, that they both defy the influence of time;
χρονον δε anSweet as in youth its balmy breath Diffuses odour e'en in death!
Oh!
whence could such a plant have sprung?
Attend-for thus the tale is sung.
When, humid, from the silvery stream, Effusing beauty's warmest beam, Venus appear'd, in flushing hues, Mellowed by ocean's briny dews;
When, in the starry courts above, The pregnant brain of mighty Jove Disclosed the nymph of azure glance, The nymph who shakes the martial lance!
Epis, 8τε ςοδα οιδεν.
Unfortunately the similitude lies not in their duration, but their transience.
Sweet as in youth, its balmy breath Diffuses odour e'en in death /]
Thus Casper Bar- læus, in his Ritus Nuptiarum:
Nor then the rose its odour loses, - When all its flushing beauties die;
Nor less ambrosial balm diffuses,- When wither'd by the solar eye!
Then, then, in strange eventful hour, The earth produced an infant flower, Which sprung, with blushing tinctures drest, And wanton'd o'er its parents breast.
The gods beheld this brilliant birth, And hail'd the Rose, the boon of earth!
With nectar drops, a ruby tide, The sweetly orient buds they dyed,With nectar drops, a ruby tide, The sweetly orient buds they dyed, &c.]
The author of the " Pervigilium Veneris" (a poem attributed to Catullus, the style of which appears to me to have all the laboured luxuriance of a much later period) ascribes the tincture of the rose to the blood from the wound of Adonis.
According to the emendation of Lipsius.
In the following epigram this hue is differently accounted for:
And bade them bloom, the flowers divine
Of him who sheds the teeming vine;
And bade them on the spangled thorn Expand their bosoms to the morn.
While the enamoured queen of joy Flies to protect her lovely boy, On whom the jealous war-god rushes;
She treads upon a thorned rose, And while the wound with crimson flows, The snowy flowret feels her blood, and blushes !
HE, who instructs the youthful crew To bathe them in the brimmer's dew, And taste, uncloy'd by rich excesses, All the bliss that wine possesses!
He, who inspires the youth to glance
In winged circlets through the dance;
Bacchus, the god again is here, And leads along the blushing year;

Degen.
This appears to be one of the hymns which were sung at the anniversary festival of the vintage;
one of the επιληνιοl vμοι) as our poet himself terms them in the fifty-ninth ode.
We cannot help feeling a peculiar veneration for these relics of the religion of antiquity.
Horace may be supposed to have written the nineteenth ode of his second book, and the twenty- fifth of the third, for some bacchanalian celebration of this kind.
The blushing year with rapture teems, Ready to shed those cordial streams, Which, sparkling in the cup of mirth, Illuminate the sons of earth!
And when the ripe and vermil wine, Sweet infant of the pregnant vine, Which now in mellow clusters swells, Oh!
when it bursts its rosy cells,
The heavenly stream shall mantling flow, To balsam every mortal woe!
No youth shall then be wan or weak, For dimpling health shall light the cheek;
Which ,sparkling in the cup of mirth, Illuminate the sons of earth!]
In the original treroy πςονον Madame Dacier thinks that the poet here had the nepenthe of Homer in his mind.
Odyssey, lib. iv.
This nepenthe was a something of exquisite charm, infused by Helen into the wine of her guests, which had the power of dispelling every anxiety.
A French writer, with very elegant gallantry, conjectures that this spell, which made the bowl so beguiling, was the charm of Helen's conver- sation.
See De Mere, quoted by Bayle, art.
Helene.
No heart shall then desponding sigh, For wine shall bid despondence fly!
Thus-till another autumn's glow Shall bid another vintage flow!
AND whose immortal hand could shed Upon this disk the ocean's bed?
This ode is a very animated description of a pic- ture of Venus on a discus, which represented the goddess in her first emergence from the waves.
About two centuries after our poet wrote, the pencil of the artist Apelles embellished this subject, in his famous painting of the Venus Anadyomene, the model of which, as Pliny informs us, was the beau- tiful Campaspe, given to him by Alexander;
though, according to Natalis Comes, lib.
vii. cap. 16, it was Phryne who sat to Apelles for the face and breast of this Venus.
There are a few blemishes in the reading of the ode before us, which have influenced Faber, Heyne, Brunck, &c. to denounce the whole poem as spurious.
Non ego paucis offendar maculis.
I think it is beautiful enough to be authentic.
And whose immortal hand could shed Upon this disk the ocean's bed?]
The abruptness of αρα τις τοςενσε
wοντον, is finely expressive of sudden admiration, and is one of those beauties, which we cannot but admire in their source, though, by fre- quent imitation, they are now become languid and unimpressive.
And, in a frenzied flight of soul Sublime as heaven's eternal pole, Imagine thus, in semblance warm, The Queen of Lovers voluptuous form Floating along the silvery sea
In beauty's naked majesty!
Oh!
he has given the captured sight A witching banquet of delight;
And all those sacred scenes of love, Where only hallowed eyes may rove, Lie faintly glowing, half-concealed, Within the lucid billows veiled.
Light as the leaf, that summers breeze
Has wafted o'er the glassy seas,And all those sacred scenes of love, Where only hallow'd eyes may rove, &c.]
The picture here has all the delicate character of the semi-reducta Venus, and is the sweetest emblem of what the poetry of passion ought to be;
glowing but through a viel, and stealing upon the heart from concealment.
Few of the ancients have attained this modesty of description, which is like the golden cloud that hung over Jupiter and Juno, impervious to every beam but that of fancy.
She floats upon the ocean's breast, Which undulates in sleepy rest, And stealing on, she gently pillows Her bosom on the amorous billows.

In languid luxury soft she glides, Encircled by the azure tides,Her bosom, like the humid rose &c.] " Ροδεωγ (says an anonymous annotator) is a whimsical epithet for the bosom."
Neither Catullus nor Gray have been of his opinion.
The former has the expression, En hic in roseis latet papillis.
And the latter, Lo! where the rosy-bosom'd hours, &c.Crottus, a modern Latinist, might indeed be cen- sured for too vague an use of the epithet" rosy," when he applies it to the eyes:
" e roseis oculis.
"Like some fair lily, faint with weeping, Upon a bed of violets sleeping!
Beneath their queen's inspiring glance, The dolphins o'er the green sea dance, Bearing in triumph young Desire, And baby Love with smiles of fire!

In the original '0 δραπετης o χρυσος.
There is a kind of pun in these words, as Madame Dacier has already remarked;
for Chrysos, which signifies gold, was also a frequent name for a slave.
In one of Lucian's dialogues, there is, I think, a similar play upon the word, where the followers of Chrysippus are called golden fishes.
The puns of the ancients are, in general, even more vapid than our own;
some of the best are those recorded of Diogenes.
Andflies me (as he flies me ever ), &c.J Αει δ', αει με ϕενγει.
This grace of iteration has already been taken notice of.

Sweet are the sighs that thrill the lyre;

Original:
Horace has " Desiderîque temperare poculum," not figuratively, however, like Anacreon, but im- porting the love-philtres of the witches.
By " cups of kisses" our poet may allude to a favourite gallantry among the ancients, of drinking when the lips of their mistresses had touched the brim:
"
Or leave a kiss within the cup, " And I'll not ask for wine.
"As in Ben Jonson's translation from Philostratus ;
and Lucian has a conceit upon the same idea, " 'Iva xαι ωινης αμα χαι ϕιλης" " that you may at once bath drink and kiss.
"When my full soul, in Fancy's stream, Pours o'er the lyre its swelling theme.
Away, away!

Now, now they press the pregnant grapes,
And now the captive stream escapes, In fervid tide of nectar gushing, And for its bondage proudly blushing!
The title Επιληνις;
νμνος, 'which Barnes has given to this ode, is by no means appropriate.
We have already had one of those hymns (ode 56), but this is a description of the vintage :
and the title εις;
olvov which it bears in the Vatican MS.
is more correct than any that have been suggested.
Degen, in the true spirit of literary scepticism* doubts that this ode is genuine, without assigning any reason for such a suspicion.
"
Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare;
" but this is far from satisfactory criticism.
While, round the vat's impurpled brim, The choral song, the vintage hymn
Of rosy youths and virgins fair, Steals on the cloyed and panting air.
Mark, how they drink, with all their eyes,
The orient tide that sparkling flies;
The infant balm of all their fears, The infant Bacchus, born in tears!
When he, whose verging years decline
As deep into the vale as mine, When he inhales the vintage-spring, His heart is fire, his foot's a wing;
And as he flies, his hoary hair Plays truant with the wanton air!
While the warm youth, whose wishing soul Has kindled o'er th' inspiring bowl,- Impassioned seeks the shadowy grove, 4 Where, in the tempting guise of love, Reclining sleeps some witching maid, Whose sunny charms, but half display'd, Blush thro' the bower, that, closely twin'd, Excludes the kisses of the wind!
The virgin wakes, the glowing boy Allures her to th' embrace of joy;
Swears that the herbage heaven had spread, Was sacred as the nuptial bed;
That laws should never bind desire, And love was nature's holiest fire!
The virgin weeps, the virgin sighs;
He kissed her lips, he kissed her eyes;
The sigh was balm, the tear was dew, They only raised his flame anew.
Swears that the herbage heaven had spread, Was sacred as the nuptial bed;

The original here has been variously interpreted.
Some, in their zeal for our author's purity, have supposed, that the youth only persuades her to a premature marriage.
Others understand from the words ωροδοτlv γαμωυ yενσθι, that he seduces her to a violation of the nuptial vow.
The turn which I have given it is somewhat like the sentiment of Heloïsa, " amorem conjugio, libertatem vinculo præferre."
(See her original Letters.)
The Italian translations have almost all wantoned upon this description;
but that of Marchetti is indeed " nimium lubricus aspici.
"And oh!

But we ought not to judge from this diver- sity of style, in a poet of whom time has preserved such partial relics.
If we knew Horace but as a satirist, should we easily believe there could dwell such animation in his lyre?
Suidas says that our poet wrote hymns, and this perhaps is one of them.
We can perceive in what an altered and imperfect state his works are -at present, when we find a scho- liast upon Horace citing an ode from the third book of Anacreon.
Which, as my trembling lips repeat, Thy chords shall echo back as sweet.

I sing the blushing Daphne's flight From this æthereal youth of light;

Whose leaves, with sympathetic thrill, In terror seemed to tremble still!

Original:
I find the word xεvτpov here has a double force, as it also signifies that " omnium parentem, quam sanctus Numa, &c. &c." (See Martial.)
In order to confirm this import of the word here, those who are curious in new readings, may place the stop after ϕνσεως, thus:
This sweetly-mad'ning dream of soul Has hurried me beyond the goal.

Which fly to wound celestial hearts,

Such is the lesson given us by the lyrist;
and if, in poetry, a simple elegance of sentiment, enriched by the most playful felicities of fancy, be a charm which invites or deserves imitation, where shall we find such a guide as Anacreon ?
In morality too, with some little reserve, I think we might not blush to follow in his footsteps.
For if his song be the lan- guage of his heart, though luxurious and relaxed, he was artless and benevolent;
and who would not forgive a few irregularities, when atoned for byStill let the nectar'd numbers float, Distilling love in every note!
virtues so rare and so endearing?
When we think of the sentiment in those lines:
Away!
I hate the slanderous dart, Which steals to wound th'unwary heart,how many are there in the world, to whom we would wish to say, Tov Avαχςεοτα μιμ8 !
Here ends the last of the odes in the Vatican MS.
whose authority confirms the genuine antiquity of them all, though a few have stolen among the number, which we may hesitate in attributing to Anacreon.
In the little essay prefixed to this translation, I observed that Barnes has quoted this manuscript incorrectly, relying upon an imperfect copy of it, which Isaac Vossius had taken;
I shall just mention two or three instances of this inaccuracy, the first which occur to me.
In the ode of the Dove, on the words ΙΙτεροlσl συγχλυψω, he says, " Vatican MS. συσxιδων etiam Prisciano invito," though the MS.
reads συγxαλνψω, with σνσxιασω interlined.
Degen too, on the same line, is somewhat in error.
In the twenty-second ode of this series, line thirteenth, the MS.
has τενιη with αι interlined, and Barnes imputes to it the reading of τενιδη.
In the fifty-seventh, lineAnd when the youth, whose burning soul Has felt the Paphian starts controul, When he the liquid lays shall hear, His heart will flutter to his ear, And drinking there of song divine, Banquet on intellectual wine!
twelfth, he professes to have preserved the reading fo the MS.
Αλαλημενη δ' εωαντη while the latter has αλαλημενος δ' eπ αντα.
Almost all the other annotators have transplanted these errors from Barnes.
GOLDEN hues of youth are fled;
Hoary locks deform my head.
Bloomy graces, dalliance gay, All the flowers of life decay.
The intrusion of this melancholy ode, among the careless levities of our poet, has always reminded me of the skeletons, which the Egyptians used to hang up in their banquet-rooms, to inculcate a thought of mortality even amidst the dissipations of mirth.
If it were not for the beauty of its numbers, the Teian Muse should disown this ode.
Quid habet illius, illius quæ spirabat amores?
To Stobæus we are indebted for it.
Bloomy graces, dalliance gay, All theflowers of life decay.]
Horace often, with feeling and elegance, deplores the fugacity of human enjoyments.
See book ii.

and thus in the second epistle, book ii.
Withering age begins to trace Sad memorials o'er my face;
- Time has shed its sweetest bloom, All the future must be gloom!
This awakes my hourly sighing;
Dreary is the thought of dying!
Pluto's is a dark abode, Sad the journey, sad the road:
The wing of every passing day Withers some blooming joy away;
And wafts from our enamoured arms
The banquet's mirth, the virgin's charms.
Dreary is the thought of dying ! &c.]
Regnier, a libertine French poet, has written some sonnets on the approach of death, full of gloomy and trembling repentance.
Chaulieu, however, supports more consistently the spirit of the Epicurean philosopher.
See his poem, addressed to the Marquis La Farre.
Plus j'approche du terme et moins je le redoute, &c.
I shall leave it to the moralist to make his reflec- tions here;
it is impossible to be very Anacreontic on such a subject.
And, the gloomy travel o'er, Ah!
we can return no more!
And, the gloomy travel o'er, - Ah!
we can return no more!]
Scaliger, upon Catullus's well-known lines, " Qui nunc it per iter, &c. remarks, that Acheron, with the same idea, is called ανεξοδος by Theocritus, and δνσεxδρομος by Nicander.
FILL me, boy, as deep a draught, As e'er was fill'd, as e'er was quaff'd;
But let the water amply flow,- To cool the grape's intemperate glow;
Let not the fiery god be single, But with the nymphs in union mingle.
This ode consists of two fragments, which are to be found in Athenaæus, book x. and which Barnes, from the similarity of their tendency, has combined into one.
I think this a very justifiable liberty, and have adopted it in some other fragments of our poet.
Degen refers us here to verses of Uz, lib. iv. der Trinker.
But let the water amply flow, To cool the grape's intemperate glow ;
&c.]
It was Amphictyon who first taught the Greeks to mix water with their wine;
in commemoration of which circumstance they erected altars to Bacchus and the nymphs.
On this mythological allegory the follow- ing epigram is founded:
For though the bowl's the grave of sadness, Oh!
be it ne'er the birth of madness!
No, banish from our board to-night
The revelries of rude delight ?
To Scythians leave these wild excesses, Ours be the joy that sooths and blesses !
And while the temperate bowl we wreathe, Our choral hymns shall sweetly breathe, Beguiling every hour along With harmony of soul and song!
Which is, non verbum verbo,
While heavenly fire consum'd his Theban dame, A Naiad caught young Bacchus from the flame, And dipped him burning in her purest lymph;
Still, still he loves the sea-maid's chrystal urn, And when his native fires infuriate burn, He bathes him in the fountain of the nymph.
To Love, the soft and blooming child, I touch the harp in descant wild;
To Love, the babe of Cyprian bowers, The boy, who breathes and blushes flowers!
To Love, for heaven and earth adore him, And gods and mortals bow before him!"
This fragment is preserved in Clemens Alex- andrinus, Strom. lib. vi. and in Arsenius, Collect.
Græc." Barnes.
It appears to have been the opening of a hymn in praise of Love.
HASTE thee, nymph, whose winged spear Wounds the fleeting mountain-deer!
Dian, Jove's immortal child, Huntress of the savage wild!
Goddess with the sun-bright hair!
Listen to a peopled prayer,This hymn to Diana is extant in Hephæstion.
There is an anecdote of our poet, which has led some to doubt whether he ever wrote any odes of this kind.
It is related by the Scholiast upon Pindar (Isthmionic. od. ii. v. 1. as cited by Barnes).
Ana- creon being asked, why he addressed all his hymns to women, and none to the deities?
answered, " Because women are my dieties.
"I have assumed the same liberty in reporting this anecdote, which I have done in translating some of the odes;
and it were to be wished that these little infidelities were always considered pardonable in the interpretation of the ancients;
thus, when nature is forgotten in the original, in the translation " tamen usque recurret.
"Turn, to Lethe's river turn, There thy vanquished people mourn!
Come to Lethe's wavy shore, There thy peopled peace restore.
Thine their hearts, their altars thine;
Dian!
must they, must they pine ?
Turn, to Lethe's river turn, There thy vanquished people mourn /]
Lethe, a river of Ionia, according to Strabo, falling into the Mean- der :
near to it was situated the town Magnesia, in favour of whose inhabitants our poet is supposed to have addressed this supplication to Diana.
It was written (as Madame Dacier conjectures) on the occasion of some battle, in which the Magnesians had been defeated.
LIKE some wanton filly sporting, Maid of Thrace!
thou fly'st my courting.
Wanton filly!
tell me why Thou trip'st away, with scornful eye, And seem'st to think my doating heart
Is novice in the bridling art ?
Believe me, girl, it is not so;
Thou'lt find this skilful hand can throwThis ode, which is addressed to some Thracian girl, exists in Heraclides, and has been imitated very frequently by Horace, as all the annotators have remarked.
Madame Dacier rejects the allegory, which runs so obviously throughout it, and supposes it to have been addressed to a young mare belonging to Polycrates:
there is more modesty than ingenuity in the lady's conjecture.
Pierius, in the fourth book of his Hieroglyphics, cites this ode, and informs us, that a horse was the hieroglyphical emblem of pride.
The reins upon that tender form, However wild, however warm!
Thou'It own that I can tame thy force, And turn and wind thee in the course.
Though wasting now thy careless hours, Thou sport amid the herbs and flowers, Thou soon shalt feel the rein's controul, And tremble at the wish'd.

To thee, the Queen of nymphs divine, Fairest of all that fairest shine;
To thee, thou blushing young desire, Who rul'st the world with darts of fire!
And oh!
thou nuptial power, to thee Who bear'st of life the guardian key;
This ode is introduced in the Romance of Theo- dorus Prodromus, and is that kind of epithalamium which was sung like a scolium at the nuptial banquet.
Among the many works of the impassioned Sappho, of which time and ignorant superstition have deprived us, the loss of her epithalamiums is not one of the least that we deplore.
A subject so interesting to an amorous fancy, was warmly felt, and must have been warmly described, by such a soul and such an imagination.
The following lines are cited as a relic of one of her epithalamiums:
See Scaliger, in his Poetics, on the Epithalamium.
1
Breathing my soul in fragrant praise, And weaving wild my votive lays, For thee, 0 Queen!
I wake the lyre, For thee, thou blushing young desire!
And oh!
for thee, thou nuptial power, Come and illume this genial hour.
Look on thy bride, luxuriant boy!
And while thy lambent glance of joy Plays over all her blushing charms, Delay not, snatch her to thine arms, Before the lovely, trembling prey, Like a young birdling, wing away!
Oh!
Stratocles, impassioned youth!
Dear to the Queen of amorous truth, And dear to her, whose yielding zone Will soon resign her all thine own;
Turn to Myrilla, turn thine eye, Breathe to Myrilla, breathe thy sigh!
To those bewitching beauties turn, For thee they mantle, flush and bum!
Not more the rose, the queen of flowers, Outblushes all the glow of bowers, Than she unrivalled bloom discloses, The sweetest rose where all are roses!
Oh!
may the sun, benignant, shed His blandest influence o'er thy bed;
And foster there an infant tree, To blush like her, and bloom like thee!
And foster there an infant tree, To blush like her and bloom like thee!']
Original Κυπαριττ
ος δε ωεϕνοι σευ ευι χηπω.
Passeratius, upon the words, " cum castum amisit florem," in the nuptial song of Catullus, after explaining " flos" in somewhat a similar sense to that which Gaulminus attributes to ςοδον, says, " Hortum quoque vocant in quo flos ille carpitur, et Græcis χηποv εςι -TO εϕ γυμαιxωυ."
-May I remark, that the author of the Greek ver- sion of this charming ode of Catullus, has neglected a most striking and Anacreontic beauty in those verses, " Ut flos in septis, &c." which is the repeti- tion of the line, " Multi ilium pueri, multæ optavere puellæ," with the slight alteration of nulli and nullæ.
Catullus himself, however, has been equally injudi- cious in his version of the famous ode of Sappho;
he has translated yελωσας ιμεροεν, but takes no notice of αδv ϕωv8σας.
Horace has caught the spirit of it more faithfully:
GENTLE youth!
whose looks assume
Such a soft and girlish bloom, Why, repulsive, why refuse
The friendship which my heart pursues ?
Thou little know'st the fond controul ,With which thy virtue reins my soul!
Then smile not on my locks of grey;
Believe me, oft with converse gay,I have formed this poem of three or four different fragments, which is a liberty that - perhaps may be justified by the example of Barnes, who has thus compiled the fifty-seventh of his edition, and the little ode beginning ϕεp'
υδος, ϕερ olνον, a ωαι, which he has subjoined to the epigrams.
The fragments combined in this ode, are the sixty-seventh, ninety-sixth, ninety-seventh, and hun- dredth of Barnes's edition, to which I refer the reader for the names of the authors by whom they are pre- served.
I've chained the ear of tender age, And boys have lov'd the prattling sage!
For mine is many a soothing pleasure, And mine is many a soothing measure;
And much I hate the beamless mind, Whose earthly vision, unrefin'd, Nature has never formed to see The beauties of simplicity!
Simplicity, the flower of heaven, To souls elect, by nature given!
And boys have lov'd the prattling sage /]
Monsieur Chaulieu has given a very amiable idea of an old man's intercourse with youth:
RICH in bliss, I proudly scorn The stream of Amalthea's horn!,
Nor should I ask to call the throne
Of the Tartessian prince my own;
To totter through his train of years, The victim of declining fears.
One little hour of joy to me Is worth a dull eternity!
This fragment is preserved in the third book of Strabo.
Of the Tartessian prince my own;

He here alludes to Arganthonius, who lived, according to Lucian, an hundred and fifty years, and reigned, according to Herodotus, eighty.

Now Neptune's sullen month appears,
The angry night-cloud swells with tears;
And savage storms, infuriate driven, Fly howling in the face of heaven!
Now, now, my friends, the gathering gloom With roseate rays of wine illume:
And while our wreaths of parsley spread
Their fadeless foliage round our head, We'll hymn th'almighty power of wine, And shed libations on his shrine!
This is composed of two fragments;
the seventieth and eighty-first in Barnes.
They are both found in Eustathius.
THEY wove the lotus band to deck, And fan with pensile wreath their neck;
And every guest, to shade his head, Three little breathing chaplets spread;
Three fragments form this little ode, all of which are preserved in Athenæus.
They are the eighty- second, seventy-fifth, and eighty-third, in Barnes.

Longepierre, to give an idea of the luxurious estimation in which garlands were held by the ancients, relates an anec- dote of a courtezan, who, in order to gratify three lovers, without leaving cause for jealousy with any of them, gave a kiss to one, let the other drink after her, and put a garland on the brow of the third;
so that each was satisfied with his favour, and flattered himself with the preference.
This circumstance is extremely like the subject of one of the tensons of Savari de Mauleon, a Trou- badour.
See L'Histoire Litteraire des Troubadours.
The recital is a curious picture of the puerile gal- lantries of chivalry.
And one was of Egyptian leaf, The rest were roses, fair and brief!
While, from a golden vase profound, To all on flowery beds around, A goblet-nymph, of heavenly shape, Poured the rich weepings of the grape!
A BROKEN cake, with honey sweet, Is all my spare and simple treat;
And while a generous bowl I crown
To float my little banquet down, I take the soft, the amorous lyre, And sing of lovers delicious fire!
In mirthful measures, warm and free, I sing, dear maid, and sing for thee!
This poem is compiled by Barnes, from Athenæus, Hephæstion, and Arsenius.
See Barnes, 80th.WITH twenty chords my lyre is hung, And while I wake them all for thee, Thou, 0 virgin, wild and young, Disport'st in airy levity.
The nursling fawn, that in some shade Its antler'd mother leaves behind, Is not more wantonly afraid, More timid of the rustling wind!
This I have formed from the eighty-fourth and eighty-fifth of Barnes's edition.
The two fragments are found in Athensæus.
The nursling fawn, that in some shade Its antler'd mother leaves behind, &c.]
In the original:
" Horned" here, undoubtedly, seems a strange epithet;
Madame Dacier however observes, that Sophocles,' Callimachus, &c. have all applied it in the very same manner, and she seems to agree in the conjecture of the Scholiast upon Pindar, that perhaps horns are not always peculiar to the males.
I think we may with more ease conclude it to be a license of the poet, " jussit habere puellam cornua."
FARE thee well, perfidious maid!
My soul, too long on earth delay'd, Delay'd, perfidious girl!
by thee, Is now on wing for liberty.
I By to seek a kindlier sphere, Since thou hast ceased to love me here!
This fragment is preserved by the Scholiast upon Aristophanes, and is the eighty-seventh in Barnes.
I BLOOMED awhile, in happy flower, Till Love approach'd one fatal hour, And made my tender branches feel
The wounds of his avenging steel.
Then, then I fell, like some poor willow That tosses on the wintry billow!
This is to be found in Hephæstion, and is the eighty-ninth of Barnes's edition.
I must here apologize for omitting a very, consi- derable fragment imputed to our poet, Εανθη ð'Etlpu" πυλη μελεl, &c. which is preserved in the twelfth book of Atheηæus, and is the ninety-first in Barnes.
If it was really Anacreon who wrote it, nil fuit un- quam sic impar sibi.
It is in a style of gross satire, and is full of expressions which never could be grace- fully translated.
MONARCH Love!
resistless boy, With whom the rosy Queen of Joy, And nymphs, that glance ethereal blue, Disporting tread the mountain-dew;
Propitious, oh!
receive my sighs,
Which, burning with entreaty, rise, That thou wilt whisper to the breast
Of her I love thy soft behest;
And counsel her to learn from thee The lesson thou hast taught to me.
Ah!
if my heart no flattery tell, Thou'lt own I've learned that lesson well!
This fragment is preserved by Dion Chrysostom.

This fragment, which is extant in Athenaeus (Barnes, 101), is supposed, on the authority of Chameleon, to have been addressed to Sappho.
We have also a stanza attributed to her, which some romancers have sup- posed to be her answer to Anacreon.
" Mats par malheur (as Bayle says), Sappho vint au monde environ cent ou six vingt ans avant Anacreon."

The following is her fragment, the compliment of which is very finely imagined;
she supposes the Muse has dictated the verses of Anacreon:
And, on those wings that sparkling play, Waft, oh!
waft me hence away!
Love!
my soul is full of thee, Alive to all thy luxury.
But she, the nymph for whom I glow, The pretty Lesbian, mocks my woe;
Smiles at the hoar and silvered hues Which Time upon my forehead strews.
Alas!
I fear she keeps her charms, In store for younger, happier arms!
Oh Muse!
who sitt'st on golden throne, Full many a hymn of dulcet tone The Teian sage is taught by thee;
But, Goddess, from thy throne of gold, The sweetest hymn thou'st ever told, He lately learn'd and sang for me.
HITHER, gentle Muse of mine, Come and teach thy votary old, Many a golden hymn divine, For the nymph with vest of gold.
Pretty nymph, of tender age, Fair thy silky locks unfold;
Listen to a hoary sage, Sweetest maid with vest of gold!
This is formed of the 124th and 119th fragments in Barnes, both of which are to be found in Scaliger's Poetics.
De Pauw thinks that those detached lines and couplets, which Scaliger has adduced as examples in his Poetics, are by no means authentic, but of his own fabrication.
WOULD that I were a tuneful lyre, Of burnished ivory fair;
Which, in the Dionysian choir, Some blooming boy should bear!
Would that I were a golden vase, And then some nymph should hold My spotless frame, with blushing grace, Herself as pure as gold!
This is generally inserted among the remains of Alcæus.
Some, however, have attributed it to Anacreon.
See our poet's twenty-second ode, and the notes.
WHEN Cupid sees my beard of snow, Which blanching Time has taught to flow, Upon his wing of golden light He passes with an eaglets flight, And flitting on he seems to say, " Fare thee well, thou'st had thy day!

This fragment, to which I have taken the liberty of adding a turn, not to be found in the original, is cited by Lucian in his little essay on the Gallic Hercules.
CUPID, whose lamp has lent the ray, Which lightens our meandering way;
Cupid, within my bosom stealing, Excites a strange and mingled feeling, Which pleases, though severely teasing, And teases, though divinely pleasing!
Barnes, 125th.
This, if I remember right, is in Scaliger's Poetics.
Gail has omitted it in his col- lection of fragments.
LET me resign a wretched breath, Since now remains to me No other balm than kindly death To sooth my misery!
This fragment is extant in Arsenius and Hephæ- tion.
See Barnes (69th), who has arranged the metre of it very elegantly.
I KNOW thou lov'st a brimming measure, And art a kindly, cordial host;
But let me fill and drink at pleasure, Thus I enjoy the goblet most.

This fragment,"which is quoted by.
Athenæus, is an excellent lesson for the votaries of Jupiter Hospitalis.
I FEAR that love disturbs my rest, Yet feel not love's impassioned care;
I think there's madness in my breast, Yet cannot find that madness there!
This fragment is in Hephæstion.
See Barnes, 95th.Catullus expresses something of this contrariety of feelings:
I love thee and hate thee, but if I can tell
The cause of my love and my hate, may I die!
I can feel it, alas!
I can feel it too well, That I love thee and hate thee, but cannot tell why.
FROM dread Leucadia's frowning steep, I'll plunge into the whitening deep:
And there I'll float, to waves resign'd, For Love intoxicates my mind!
This also is in Hephæstion, and perhaps is a fragment of some poem, in which Anacreon had commemorated the fate of Sappho.
It is the 123d of Barnes.
Mix me, child, a cup divine, Crystal water, ruby wine:
Weave the frontlet, richly flushing, O'er my wintry temples blushing.
Mix the brimmer—Love and I Shall no more the gauntlet try.
Here-upon this holy bowl, I surrender all my soul!
This fragment is collected by Barnes from Deme- trius Phalareus, and Eustathius, and is subjoined in his edition to the epigrams attributed to our poet.
And here is the last of those little scattered flowers, which I thought I might venture with any grace to transplant.
I wish it could be said of the garland which they form, To δ' ωζ Avαϰρεοντς.
Among the Epigrams of the Anthology there are some panegyrics on Anacreon, which I had translated, and originally intended as a kind of Coronis to the work;
but I found, upon consideration, that they wanted variety;
a fre- quent recurrence of the same thought, within the limits of an epitaph, to which they are con- fined, would render a collection of them rather uninteresting.
I shall take the liberty, however, of subjoining a few, that I may not appear to have totally neglected those elegant tributes to the reputation of Anacreon.
The four epi- grams which I give are imputed to Antipater Sidonius.
They are rendered, perhaps, with too much freedom;
but designing a translation of all that are on the subject, I imagined it was necessary to enliven their uniformity by some- times indulging in the liberties of paraphrase.
AROUND the tomb, oh bard divine!
Where soft thy hallowed brow reposes, Long may the deathless ivy twine, And Summer pour her waste of roses!
Antipater Sidonius, the author of this epigram, lived, according to Vossius, de Poetis Græcis, in the second year of the 169th Olympiad.
He appears, from what Cicero and Quintilian have said of him, to have been a kind of improvvisatore.
See Institut. Orat. lib. x. cap. 7. There is nothing more known respecting this poet, except some particulars aboutAnd many a fount shall there distil, And many a rill refresh the flowers;
But wine shall gush in every rill,
And every fount be milky showers.
Thus, shade of him, whom Nature taught To tune his lyre and soul to pleasure, Who gave to love his warmest thought, Who gave to love his fondest measure!
his illness and death, which are mentioned as curious by Pliny and others;
and there remain of his works but a few epigrams in the Anthologia, among which are these I have selected, upon Anacreon.
Those remains have been sometimes imputed to another poet* of the same name, of whom Vossius gives us the following account:
" Antipater Thessalonicensis vixit tempore August!
Cæsaris, ut qui saltantem viderit Pyladem, sicut constat ex quodam ejus epi- grammate Ανθολογιας, lib. iv. tit. εις ορχηςριδας.
At eum ac Bathvllum primos fuisse pantomimos ac sub Augusto claruisse, satis notum ex Dione, &c. &c.
"Thus, after death, if spirits feel, Thou mays't, from odours round thee streaming, A pulse of past enjoyment steal, And live again in blissful dreaming!
The reader, who thinks it worth observing, may find a strange oversight in Hoffman's quotation of this article from Vossius, Lexic.
Universe
By the omission of a sentence he has made Vossius assert that the poet Antipater was one of the first panto- mime dancers in Rome.
Barnes, upon the epigram before us, mentions a version of it by Brodæus, which is not to be found in that commentator;
but he more than once confounds Brodaeus, with another annotator on the Anthologia, Vincentius Obsopœus, who has given a translation of the epigram.
HERE sleeps Anacreon, in this ivied shade;
Here mute in death the Teian swan is laid.
Cold, cold the heart, which liv'dbutto respire
All the voluptuous frenzy of desire!
tile Teian swan is laid. ]
Thus Horace of Pindar :
A swan was the hieroglyphical emblem of a poet.
Anacreon has been called the swan of Téos by another of his eulogists.
And yet, oh Bard!
thou art not mute in death, Still, still we catch thy lyre'sdelicious breath;
And still thy songs of soft Bathylla bloom, Green as tIle ivy round the mouldering tomb!
God of the grape !
thou hast betray'd
In wine's bewildering dream
The fairest swan that ever play'd Along the Muse's stream!
The Teian, nurs'd with all those honied boys, The young Desires, light Loves, and rose-lip'd Joys !
Still, still we catch thy lyre's delicious breath ;
]
Thus Simonides, speaking of our poet:
Nor yet are all his numbers mute, Though dark within the tomb he lies;
But living still, his amorous lute With sleepless animation sighs!
Nor yet has death obscured thy fire of love, Still, still it lights thee through the Elysian grove;
And dreams are thine, that bless th'elect alone, And Venus calls thee e'en in death her own!
This is the famous Simonides, whom Plato styled " divine;
" though Le Fevre, in his Poetes Grecs, supposes that the epigrams under his name are all falsely imputed.
The most considerable of his remains is a satirical poem upon women, preserved by Stobasus, Ψογ γυναιϰων.
We may judge from the lines I have just quoted, and the import of the epigram before us, that the works of Anacreon were perfect in the times of Simonides and Antipater.
Obsopceus, the commen- tator here, appears to exult in their destruction;
and telling us they were burned by the bishops and patriarchs, he adds, " nec sane id necquicquam fece- runt," attributing to this outrage an effect which it could never produce.
On!
stranger, if Anacreon's shell
Has ever taught thy heart to swell With passions throb or pleasure's sigh, In pity turn, as wandering nigh,The spirit of Anacreon utters these verses from the tomb, somewhat " mutatus ab illo," at least in simplicity of expression.
if Anacreon's shell Has ever taught thy heart to swell, &c.]
We may guess from the words εϰ βιλων εμων, that Anacreon was not merely a writer of billets-doux, as some French critics have called him.
Amongst these Mr.And drop thy goblet's richest tear
In exquisite libation here !
So shall my sleeping ashes thrill With visions of enjoyment still.
Le Fevre, with all his professed admiration, has given our poet a character by no means of an elevated cast:
See the verses prefixed to his Poetes Grecs.
This is unlike the language of Theocritus, to whom Anacreon is indebted for the following simple eulo- glum:
I cannot e'en in death resign
The festal joys that once were mine, When Harmony pursued my ways, And Bacchus wanton'd to my lays..
Upon the Statue of Anacreon.
Stranger!
who near this statue chance to roam, Let it awhile your studious eyes engage;
And you may say, returning to your home, " I've seen the image of the Teian sage, " Best of the bards who deck the Muse's page."
Then, if you add " that striplings lov'd him well," You tell them all he was, and aptly tell.
The simplicity of this inscription has always delighted me;
I have given it, I believe, as literally as a verse translation will allow.
And drop thy goblet's richest tear, &c.]
Thus Si- monides, in another of his epitaphs on our poet:
Let vines, in clustering beauty wreath'd, Drop all their treasures on his head, Whose lips a dew of sweetness breath'd, Richer than vine hath ever shed !
Oh!
if delight could charm no more, If all the goblets bliss were o'er, When fate had once our doom decreed, Then dying would be death indeed!
Nor could I think, unblest by wine, Divinity itself divine!
And Bacchus wanton'd to my lays, &.]
The original here is corrupted;
the line ὡς o Διονυσϫ, See. is unin- telligible.
Brunck's emendation improves the sense, but I doubt if it can be commended for elegance.
He reads the line thus:
See Brunck, Analecta Veter. Poet. Græc. vol.- ii.
AT length thy golden hours have wing'd their flight, And drowsy death that eyelid steepeth;
Thy harp, that whisper'd through each lingering night, Now mutely in oblivion sleepeth!
Thy harp, that whisper'd through each lingering night, &c.]
In another of these poems, " the nightly- speaking lyre" of the bard is not allowed to be silent even after his death.
She, too, for whom that harp profusely shed
The purest nectar of its numbers, Shea the young spring of thy desires, has fled, And with her blest Anacreon slumbers!
Farewel!
To beauty's smile and wine's delight, To joys he lov'd on earth so well, Still shall his spirit, all the night, Attune the wild aerial shell.
She, the young spring of thy desires, &c.]
The ori- ginal, το Ποθων εας, is beautiful.
We regret that such praise should be lavished so preposterously, and feel that the poet's mistress Eurypyle would have deserved it better.
Her name has been told us by Meleager, as already quoted, and in another epigram by Antipater.
Long may the nymph around thee play, Eurypyle, thy soul's desire!
Basking her beauties in the ray
That lights thine eyes' dissolving fire!
Farewel!
thou hadst a pulse for every dart
That love could scatter from his quiver;
And every woman found in thee a heart, Which thou, with all thy soul, didst give her!
Sing of her smile's bewitching power, Her every grace that warms and blesses;
Sing of her browns luxuriant flower, The beaming glory of her tresses.
The expression here, ανθ ϰομης, " the flower of the hair," is borrowed from Anacreon himself, as appears by a fragment of the poet preserved in Sto- bæus :
Απεϰειρας δ' ἁπαλης αμωμον ανθ.
The purest nectar of its numbers, &c.
Thus, says Brunck, in the prologue to the Satires of Persius:
Cantare credas Pegaseium nectar." Melos" is the usual reading in this line, and Casaubon has defended it;
but " nectar," I think, is much more spirited.
Farewell thou hadst a pulse for every dart, &c.]
εΦνς σϰοπ, " scopus eras natural not" speculator," as Barnes very falsely interprets it.
Vincentius Obsopceus, upon this passage, contrives to indulge us with a little astrological wisdom, and talks in a style of learned scandal about Venus, " male posita cum Marte in domo Saturni.
"And every woman found in thee a heart, &c.]
This couplet is not otherwise warranted by the original, than as it dilates the thought which Antipater has figuratively expressed.
Critias, of Athens, pays a tribute to the legitimate gallantry of Anacreon, calling him, with elegant conciseness, γυναιϰων ηπεροπευμα.
Téos gave to Greece her treasure, Sage Anacreon, sage in loving ;
Fondly weaving lays of pleasure
For the maids who blush'd approving!
