DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS, 1 the author of the following Satires, was born at Aquinum, an inconsiderable town of the Volsci, about the year of Christ 38.2
He was either the son, or the foster-son, of a wealthy freedman, who gave him a liberal education.
From the period of his birth, till he had attained the age of forty, nothing more is known of him than that he continued to perfect himself in the study of eloquence, by declaiming, according to the practice of those days ;
yet more for his own amusement, than from any intention to prepare himself either for the schools or the courts of law.
About this time he seems to have discovered his true bent, and be­ taken himself to poetry.
Domitian was now at the head of the government, and showed symptoms of reviving that system of favouritism which had nearly ruined the empire under Claudius, by his unbounded partiality for a young pantomime dancer of the name of Paris.
Against this minion, Juvenal seems to have directed the first shafts of that satire which was destined to make the most powerful vices tremble, and shake .
the masters of the world on their thrones.
He composed a few lines1 on the influence of Paris, with considerable success, which encouraged him to cultivate this kind of poetry :
he had the prudence, however, not to trust himself to an auditory, in a reign which swarmed with informers ;
and his compositions were, therefore, secretly handed about amongst his friends.
1
By degrees he grew bolder;
and, having made many large additions to his first sketch, or perhaps re-cast it, produced what is now called his Seventh Satire, which he recited to a numerous assemblage.
The consequences were such as he had probably anticipated:
Paris, informed of the part which he bore in it, was seriously offended, and complained to the emperor, who, as the old account has it, sent the author, by an easy kind of punishment, into Egypt with a military com­ mand.
To remove such a man from his court must undoubt­ edly have been desirable to Domitian ;
and, as he was spoken of with kindness in the same Satire, which is entirely free from political allusions, the " facetiousness " of the punishment (though Domitian's was not a facetious reign) renders the fact not altogether improbable.
Yet, when we consider that these reflections on Paris could scarcely have been published before LXXXIV., and that the favourite was disgraced and put to death almost immediately after, we shall be inclined to doubt whether his banishment actually took place;
or, if it did, whether it was of any long duration.
That Juvenal was in Egypt is certain ;
but he might have gone there from motives of personal safety, or, as Salmasius has it, of curiosity.
How­ ever this may be, it does not appear that he was ever long absent from Rome, where a thousand internal marks clearly show that all his Satires were written.
But whatever punish­ ment might have followed the complaint of Paris, 1 it had no other effect on our author, than that of increasing his hatred of tyranny, and turning his indignation upon the emperor himself, whose hypocrisy, cruelty, and licentiousness, became, from that period, the object of his keenest reprobation.
He profited, indeed, so far by his danger or his punishment, as to recite no more in public;
but he continued to write during the remainder of Domitian's reign, in which he finished, as I conceive, his second, third,1 fifth, sixth,2 apd perhaps thir- teenth1 Satires ;
the eighth2 I have always looked upon as his first.
In xcv., when Juvenal was in his 54th year, Domitian ban­ ished the philosophers from Rome, and soon after from Italy, with many circumstances of cruelty;
an action, for which, I am sorry to observe, he is covertly praised by Quintilian.
Though Juvenal, strictly speaking, did not come under the description of a philosopher, yet, like the hare in the fable, he might not unreasonably entertain some apprehensions for his safety, and, with many other persons eminent for learning and virtue, judge it prudent to withdraw from the city.
To this period I have always inclined to fix his journey to Egypt.
Two years afterwards the world was happily relieved from the tyranny of Domitian;
and Nerva, who succeeded him, recalled the exiles.
From this time there remains little doubt of Juvenal's being at Rome, where he continued his studies in tranquillity.
His first Satire after the death of Domitian, seems to have been what is now called the fourth.
About this time, too, he probably thought of revising and publishing those which he had already written ;
and composed or completed that intro­ ductory piece,' which now stands at the head of his works.
As the order is every where broken in upon, it is utterly im­ possible to arrange them chronologically;
but I am inclined to think that the eleventh Satire closed his poetical career.
All else is conjecture;
but in this he speaks of himself as an old man, " Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula solem and indeed he had now passed his grand climacteric.
This is all that can be collected of the life of Juvenal;
and how much of this is built upon uncertainties !
I hope, how­ ever, that it bears the stamp of probability;
which is all I contend for;
and which, indeed, if I do not deceive myself, is somewhat more than can be affirmed of what has been hitherto delivered on the subject.
Little is known of Juvenal's circumstances;
but, happily, that little is authentic, as it comes from himself.
He had a competence.
The dignity of poetry is never disgraced in him, as it is in some of his contemporaries, by fretful complaints of poverty, or clamorous whinings for meat and clothes :
-the little patrimony which his foster-father left him, he never diminished, and probably never increased.
It seems to have equalled all his wants, and, as far as appears, all his wishes.
Once only he regrets the narrowness of his fortune ;
but the occasion does him honour ;
it is solely because he cannot afford a more costly sacrifice to express his pious gratitude for the preservation of his friend:
yet " two lambs and a youthful steer " bespeak the affluence of a philosopher;
which is not belied by the entertainment provided for his friend Persicus, in that beautiful Satire which is here called the last of his works.
Further it is useless to seek :
from pride or modesty, he has left no other notices of himself;
or they have perished.
Horace and Persius, his immediate predecessors, are never weary of speaking of themselves.
The life of the former might be written, from his own materials, with all the mi­ nuteness of a contemporary history:
and the latter, who attained to little more than a third of Juvenal's age, has left nothing to be desired on the only topics which could interest posterity,-his parent, his preceptor, and his course of studies.
IT will now be expected from me, perhaps, to say something on the nature and design of Satire ;
but in truth this has so frequently been done, that it seems, at present, to have as little of novelty as of utility to recommend it.
Dryden, who had diligently studied the French critics, drew up from their remarks, assisted by a cursory perusal of what Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, and Scaliger had written on the subject, an account of the rise and progress of dramatic and satiric poetry amongst the Romans ;
which he prefixed to his translation of Juvenal.
What Dryden knew, he told in a manner that renders every attempt to recount it after him equally hopeless and vain ;
but his acquaintance with works of literature was not very extensive, while his reliance on his own powers sometimes betrayed him into inaccuracies, to which the influence of his name gives a dangerous importance."
The comparison of Horace with Juvenal and Persius," which makes a principal part of his Essay, is not formed with much niceness of discrimination, or accuracy of judgment.
To speak my mind, I do not think that he clearly perceived or fully understood the characters of the first two :
-of Persius indeed he had an intimate knowledge ;
for, though he certain­ ly deemed too humbly of his poetry, he yet speaks of his beau­ ties and defects in a manner which evinces a more than com­ mon acquaintance with both.
What Dryden left imperfect has been filled up in a great measure by Dusaulx, in the preliminary discourse to his trans­ lation of Juvenal, and by Ruperti, in his critical Essay " De diversa Satirarum Lucil.
Herat.
Pers. et Juvenalis indole.
"With the assistance of the former of these I shall endeavour to give a more extended view of the characteristic excellencies and defects of the rival Satirists than has yet appeared in our language;
little solicitous for the praise of originality, if I may be allowed to aspire to that of candour and truth.
Pre­ viously to this, however, it will be necessary to say something on the supposed origin of Satire:
and, as this is a very beaten subject, I shall discuss it as briefly as possible.
It is probable that the first metrical compositions of the Ro­ mans, like those of every other people, were pious effusions for favours received or expected from the gods :
of these, the earliest, according to Varro, were the hymns to Mars, which, though used by the Salii in the Augustan age, were no longer intelligible.,
To these succeeded the Fescennine verses, which were sung, or rather recited, after the vintage and harvest, and appear to have been little more than rude praises of the tutelar'divinities of the country, intermixed with clownish jeers and sarcasms, extemporally poured out by the rustics in some kind of measure, and indifferently directed at the audi­ ence, or at one another.
These, by degrees, assumed the form of a dialogue;
of which, as nature is every where the same, and the progress of refinement but little varied, some resem­ blance may perhaps be found in the grosser eclogues of Theo­ critus.
Thus improved, (if the word may be allowed of such bar­ barous amusements,) they formed, for near three centuries, the delight of that nation :
popular favour, however, had a dan­ gerous effect on the performers, whose licentiousness dege­ nerated at length into such wild invective, that it was found necessary to restrain it by a positive law:
" Si qui populo occentassit, carmenve condisit, quod infamiam faxit ftagitium­ ve alteri, fuste ferito."
From this time we hear no further complaints of the Fescennine verses, which continued to charm the Romans ;
until, about a century afterwards, and during the ravages of a dreadful pestilence, the senate, as the histo­ rians say, in order to propitiate the gods, called a troop of players from Tuscany, to assist at the celebration of their ancient festivals.
This was a wise and a salutary measure :
the plague had spread dejection through the city, which was thus rendered more obnoxious to its fury ;
and it therefore be­ came necessary, by novel and extraordinary amusements, to divert the attention of the people from the melancholy objects around them.
As the Romans were unacquainted with the language of Tuscany, the players, Livy tells us, omitted the modulation and the words, and confined themselves solely to gestures, which were accompanied by the flute.
This imperfect exhi­ bition, however, was so superior to their own, that the Romans eagerly strove to attain the art;
and, as soon as they could imitate what they admired, graced their rustic measures with music and dancing.
By degrees they dropped the Fescennine verses for something of a more regular kind, which now took the name of SATIRE.
1
These Satires (for as yet they had but little claim to the title of dramas) continued, without much alteration, to the year 514, when Livius Andronicus, a Greek by birth, and a freed­ man of L. Salinator, who was undoubtedly acquainted with the old comedy of his country, produced a regular play.
That it pleased cannot be doubted, for it surpassed the Satires, even in their improved state ;
and, indeed, banished them for some time from the scene.
They had, however, taken too strong a hold of the affections of the people to be easily forgotten, and it was therefore found necessary to reproduce and join them to the plays of Andronicus, (the superiority of which could not be contested,) under the name of Exodia or After-pieces.
These partook, in a certain degree, of the general amelioration of the stage ;
something like a story was now introduced into them, which, though frequently indecent and always extrava­ gant, created a greater degree of interest than the reciprocation of gross humour and scurrility in unconnected dialogues.
Whether any of the old people still regretted this sophisti­ cation of their early amusements, it is not easy to say ;
but Ennius, who came to Rome about twenty years after this period, and who was more than half a Grecian, conceived that he should perform an acceptable service by reviving the ancient Satires.
1
He did not pretend to restore them to the stage, for which indeed the new pieces were infinitely better calcu­ lated, but endeavoured to adapt them to the closet, by refining their grossness and softening their asperity.
Success justified the attempt.
Satire, thus freed from action, and formed into a poem, became a favourite pursuit, and was cultivated by several writers of eminence.
In imitation of his model, Ennius confined himself to no particular species of verse, nor indeed of language, for he mingled Greek expressions with his Latin at pleasure.
It is solely with a reference to this new attempt that Horace and Quintilian are to be understood, when they claim for the Romans the invention 2 of this kind of poetry ;
and certainly they had opportunities of judging which we have not, for little of Ennius, and nothing of the old Satire, remains.
It is not necessary to pursue the history of Satire further in this place, or to speak of another species of it, the Varro­ nian, or, as Varro himself called it, the Menippean, which branched out from the former, and was a medley of prose and verse:
it will be a more pleasing, as well as a more useful employ, to enter a little into what Dryden, I know not for what reason, calls the most difficult part of his undertaking­ " a comparative view of the Satirists not certainly with the design of depressing one at the expense of another, (for though I have translated Juvenal, I have no quarrel with Horace and Persius,) but for the purpose of pointing out the characteristic excellencies and defects of them all.
To do this the more effectually, it will be previously necessary to take a cursory view of the times in which their respective works were pro­ duced.
LUCILIUS, to whom Horace, forgetting what he had said in another place, attributes the invention of Satire, flourished in the interval between the siege of Carthage and the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutons, by Marius.
He lived therefore in an age in which the struggle between the old and new manners, though daily becoming more equal, or rather inclining to the worse side, was still far from being decided.
The freedom of speaking and writing was yet unchecked by fear, or by any law more precise than that which, as has been already men­ tioned, was introduced to restrain the coarse ebullitions of rustic malignity.
Add to this, that Lucilius was of a most respectable family, (he was great-uncle to Pompey,) and lived in habits of intimacy with the chiefs of the republic, with Laelius, Scipio, and others, who were well able to protect him from the Lupi and Mutii of the day, had they attempted, which they probably did not, to silence or molest him.
Hence that boldness of satirizing the vicious by name, which startled Horace, and on which Juvenal and Persius delight to felici­ tate him.
Too little remains of Lucilius, to enable us to judge of his manner:
his style seems, however, to bear fewer marks of delicacy than of strength, and his strictures appear harsh and violent.
With all this, he must have been an extraordinary man ;
since Horace, who is evidently hurt by his reputation, can say nothing worse of his compositions than that they are careless and hasty, and that if he had lived at a more refined period, he would have partaken of the general amelioration.
I do not remember to have heard it observed, but I suspect that there was something of political spleen in the excessive popu­ larity of Lucilius under Augustus, and something of courtly complacency in the attempt of Horace to counteract it.
Au­ gustus enlarged the law of the twelve tables respecting libels ;
and the people, who found themselves thus abridged of the liberty of satirizing the great by name, might not improbably seek to avenge themselves, by an overstrained attachment to the works of a man who, living, as they would insinuate, in better times, practised without fear, what he enjoyed without restraint.
The space between Horace and his predecessor, was a dreadful interval " filled up with horror all, and big with death."
Luxury and a long train of vices, which followed the immense wealth incessantly poured in from the conquered provinces, sapped the foundations of the republic, which were finally shaken to pieces by the civil wars, the perpetual dic­ tatorship of Cæsar, and the second triumvirate, which threw the Roman world, without a hope of escape, into the power of an individual.
Augustus, whose sword was yet reeking with the best blood of the state, now that submission left him no pretence for fur­ ther cruelty, was desirous of enjoying in tranquillity the fruits of his guilt.
He displayed, therefore, a magnificence hitherto unknown ;
and his example, which was followed by his min­ isters, quickly spread among the people, who were not very unwilling to exchange the agitation and terror of successive proscriptions, for the security and quiet of undisputed des­ potism.
Tiberius had other views, and other methods of accomplish­ ing them.
He did not indeed put an actual stop to the elegant institutions of his predecessor, but he surveyed them with silent contempt, and they rapidly degenerated.
The race of informers multiplied with dreadful celerity;
and danger, which could only be averted by complying with a caprice not always easy to discover, created an abject disposition, fitted for the recep­ tion of the grossest vices, and eminently favourable to the designs of the emperor ;
which were to procure, by universal depravation, that submission which Augustus sought to obtain by the blandishments of luxury and the arts.
From this gloomy and suspicious tyrant, the empire was transferred to a profligate madman.
It can scarcely be told without indignation, that when the sword of Chærea had freed the earth from his disgraceful sway, the senate had not suf­ ficient virtue to resume the rights of which they had been deprived ;
but, after a timid debate, delivered up the state to a pedantic dotard, incapable of governing himself.
To the vices of his predecessors, Nero added a frivolity which rendered his reign at once odious and contemptible.
Depravity could reach no further, but misery might yet be extended.
This was fully experienced through the turbulent and murderous usurpations of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius;
when the accession of Vespasian and Titus gave the groaning world a temporary respite.
To these succeeded Domitian, whose crimes form the sub­ ject of many a melancholy page in the ensuing work, and need not therefore be dwelt on here.
Under him, every trace of ancient manners was obliterated;
liberty was unknown, Jaw openly trampled upon, and, while the national rites were either neglected or contemned, a base and blind superstition took possession of the enfeebled and distempered mind.
Better times followed.
Nerva, and Trajan, and Hadrian, and the Antonines, restored the Romans to safety and tran­ quillity ;
but they could do no more;
liberty and virtue were gone for ever:
and after a short period of comparative happi­ ness, which they scarcely appear to have deserved, and which brought with it no amelioration of mind, no return of the ancient modesty and frugality, they were finally resigned to destruction.
I now proceed to the " comparative view " of which I have already spoken:
as the subject has been so often treated, little of novelty can be expected from it ;
to read, compare, and judge, is almost all that remains.
HORACE, who was gay, and lively, and gentle, and affec­ tionate, seems fitted for the period in which he wrote.
He had seen the worst times of the republic, and might therefore, with no great suspicion of his integrity, be allowed to acqui­ esce in the infant monarchy, which brought with it stability, peace, and pleasure.
How he reconciled himself to his poli­ tical tergiversation it is useless to inquire.
1
What was so general, we may suppose, brought with it but little obloquy;
and it should be remembered, to his praise, that he took no active part in the government which he had once opposed.
2
If he celebrates the master of the world, it is not until he is asked by him whether he is ashamed that posterity should know them to be friends;
and he declines a post, which few of his detractors have merit to deserve, or virtue to refuse.
His choice of privacy, however, was in some measure con­ stitutional ;
for he had an easiness of temper which bordered on indolence ;
hence he never rises to the dignity of a decided character.
Zeno and Epicurus share his homage and undergo his ridicule by turns:
he passes without difficulty from one school to another, and he thinks it a sufficient excuse for his versatility, that he continues, amidst every change, the zealous defender of virtue.
Virtue, however, abstractedly considered, has few obligations to his zeal.
But though, as an ethical writer, Horace has not many claims to the esteem of posterity;
as a critic, he is entitled to all our veneration.
Such is the soundness of his judgment, the correctness of his taste, and the extent and variety of his knowledge, that a body of criticism might be selected from his works, more perfect in its kind than any thing which antiquity has bequeathed us.
As he had little warmth of temper, he reproves his con­ temporaries without harshness.
He is content to " dwell in decencies," and, like Pope's courtly dean, " never mentions hell to ears polite."
Persius, who was infinitely better ac­ quainted with him than we can pretend to be, describes him, I think, with great happiness:
" Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico Tangit, et admissus circum præcordia ludit, Callidus excusso populum suspendere naso." " He, with a sly insinuating grace, Laugh'd at his friend, and look'd him in the face :
Would raise a blush, where secret vice he found, And tickle, while he gently probed the wound :
With seeming innocence the crowd beguiled ;
But made the desperate passes when he smiled."
These beautiful lines have a defect under which Dryden's translations frequently labour ;
they do not give the true sense of the original.
Horace " raised no blush," (at least Persius does not insinuate any such thing,) and certainly " made no desperate passes."
1 His aim rather seems to be, to keep the objects of his satire in good humour with himself, and with one another.
To raise a laugh at vice, however, (supposing it feasible,) is not the legitimate office of Satire, which is to hold up the vicious, as objects of reprobation and scorn, for the example of others, who may be deterred by their sufferings.
But it is time to be explicit.
To laugh even at fools is superfluous ;
­ if they understand you, they will join in the merriment;
but more commonly, they will sit with vacant unconcern, and gaze at their own pictures :
to laugh at the vicious, is to encourage them;
for there is in such men a wilfulness of disposition, which prompts them to bear up against shame, and to show how little they regard slight reproof, by becoming more au­ dacious in guilt.
Goodness, of which the characteristic is modesty, may, I fear, be shamed;
but vice, like folly, to be restrained, must be overawed.
Labeo, says
Hall, with great energy and beauty­ "
Labeo is whipt, and laughs me in the face ;
Why ?
for I smite, and hide the galled place.
Gird but the Cynic's helmet on his head, Cares he for Talus, or his flayle of lead ?
"PERSIUS, who borrowed so much of Horace's language, has little of his manner.
The immediate object of his imitation seems to be Lucilius;
and if he lashes vice with less severity than his great prototype, the cause must not be sought in any desire to spare what he so evidently condemned.
But he was thrown " on evil times;
" he was, besides, of a rank distin­ guished enough to make his freedom dangerous, and of an age when life had yet lost little of its novelty;
to write, therefore, even as he has written, proves him to be a person of very singular courage and virtue.
In the interval between Horace and Persius, despotism had changed its nature:
the chains which the policy of Augustus concealed in flowers, were now displayed in all their hideous­ ness.
The arts were neglected, literature of every kind dis­ couraged or disgraced, and terror and suspicion substituted in the place of the former ease and security.
Stoicism, which Cicero accuses of having infected poetry, even in his days, and of which the professors, as Quintilian observes, always disregarded the graces and elegancies of composition, spread with amazing rapidity.
1
In this school Persius was edu­ cated, under the care of one of its most learned and respect­ able masters.
Satire was not his first pursuit;
indeed, he seems to have somewhat mistaken his talents when he applied to it.
The true end of this species of writing, as Dusaulx justly says, is the improvement of society;
but for this, much knowledge of mankind (" quicquid agunt homines ") is previously neces­ sary.
Whoever is deficient in that, may be an excellent moral and philosophical poet;
but cannot, with propriety, lay claim to the honours of a satirist.
And Persius was moral and philosophical in a high degree:
lie was also a poet of no mean order.
But while he grew pale over the page of Zeno, and Cleanthes, and Chrysippus;
while he imbibed, with all the ardour of a youthful mind, the para­ doxes of those great masters, together with their principles, the foundations of civil society were crumbling around him, and soliciting his attention in vain.
To judge from what he has left us, it might almost be affirmed that he was a stranger in his own country.
The degradation of Rome was now com­ plete ;
yet he felt, at least he expresses, no indignation at the means by which it was effected:
a sanguinary buffoon was lording it over the prostrate world ;
yet he continued to waste his most elaborate efforts on the miserable pretensions of pe­ dants in prose and verse !
If this savour of the impassibility of Stoicism, it is entitled to no great praise on the score of outraged humanity, which has stronger claims on a well- regulated mind, than criticism, or even philosophy.
Dryden gives that praise to the dogmas of Persius, which he denies to his poetry. "
His verse," he says, " is scabrous and hobbling, and his measures beneath those of Horace."
This is too severe;
for Persius has many exquisite passages, which nothing in Horace will be found to equal or approach.
The charge of obscurity has been urged against him with more justice;
though this, perhaps, is not so great as it is usually represented.
Casaubon could, without question, have defended him more successfully than he has done;
but he was overawed by the brutal violence of the elder Scaliger ;
for I can scarcely persuade myself that he really believed this ob­ scurity to be owing to " the fear of Nero, or the advice of Cornutus."
The cause of it should be rather sought in his natural disposition, and in his habits of thinking.
Generally speaking, however, it springs from a too frequent use of tropes, approaching in almost every instance to a catachresis, an anxiety of compression, and a quick and unexpected trans­ ition from one over-strained figure to another.
After all, with the exception of the sixth Satire, which, from its ab­ ruptness, does not appear to have received the author's last touches, I do not think there is much to confound an attentive reader :
some acquaintance, indeed, with the porch " braccatis illita Medis," is previously necessary.
His life may be con­ templated with unabated pleasure:
the virtue he recommends, he practised in the fullest extent;
and at an age when few have acquired a determinate character, he left behind him an established reputation for genius, learning, and worth.
JUVENAL wrote at a period still more detestable than that of Persius.
Domitian, who now governed the empire, seems to have inherited the bad qualities of all his predecessors.
Tiberius was not more hypocritical, nor Caligula more bloody, nor Claudius more sottish, nor Nero more mischievous, than this ferocious despot;
who, as Theodorus Gadareus indig­ nantly declared of Tiberius, was truly πηλον αιματι πεφυραμε­ νον, a lump of clay kneaded up with blood !
Juvenal, like Persius, professes to follow Lucilius ;
but what was in one a simple attempt, is in the other a real imi­ tation, of his manner.
1 Fluent and witty as Horace, grave and sublime as Persius ;
of a more decided character than the former, better acquainted with mankind than the latter;
he did not confine himself to the mode of regulating an inter­ course with the great, or to abstract disquisitions on the na­ ture of scholastic liberty;
but, disregarding the claims of a vain urbanity, and fixing all his soul on the eternal distinc­ tions of moral good and evil, he laboured, with a magnificence of language peculiar to himself, to set forth the loveliness of virtue, and the deformity and horror of vice, in full and per­ fect display.
Dusaulx, who is somewhat prejudiced against Horace, does ample justice to Juvenal.
There is great force in what he says;
and, as I do not know that it ever appeared in English, I shall take the liberty of laying a part of it before the reader, at the hazard of a few repetitions."
The bloody revolution which smothered the last sighs of liberty,2 had not yet found time to debase the minds of a people, amongst whom the traditionary remains of the old manners still subsisted.
The cruel but politic Octavius scat­ tered flowers over the paths he was secretly tracing towards despotism:
the arts of Greece, transplanted to the Capitol, flourished beneath his auspices;
and the remembrance of so many civil dissensions, succeeding each other with increasing rapidity, excited a degree of reverence for the author of this unprecedented tranquillity.
The Romans felicitated them- selves at not lying down, as before, with an apprehension of finding themselves included, when they awoke, in the list of proscription:
and neglected, amidst the amusements of the circus and the theatre, those civil rights of which their fathers had been so jealous."
Profiting of these circumstances, Horace forgot that he had combated on the side of liberty.
A better courtier than a soldier, he clearly saw how far the refinement, the graces, and the cultivated state of his genius (qualities not much con­ sidered or regarded till his time 1) were capable of advancing him, without any extraordinary effort."
Indifferent to the future, and not daring to recall the past, he thought of nothing but securing himself from all that could sadden the mind, and disturb the system which he had skil­ fully arranged on the credit of those then in power.
It is on this account, that, of all his contemporaries, he has celebrated none but the friends of his master, or, at least, those whom he could praise without fear of compromising his favour."
In what I have said of Horace, my chief design has been to show that this Proteus, who counted among his friends and admirers even those whose conduct he censured, chose rather, to capitulate than contend;
that he attached no great import­ ance to his own rules, and adhered to his principles no longer than they favoured his views."
JUVENAL began his satiric career where the other finished, that is to say, lie did that for morals and liberty, which Horace had done for decorum and taste.
Disdaining artifice of every kind, he boldly raised his voice against the usurpation of power;
and incessantly recalled the memory of the glorious era of independence to those degenerate Romans, who had substituted suicide in the place of their ancient courage ;
and from the days of Augustus to those of Domitian, only avenged their slavery by an epigram or a bon-mot."
The characteristics of Juvenal were energy, passion, and indignation:
it is, nevertheless, easy to discover that lie is sometimes more afilicted than exasperated.
His great aim was to alarm the vicious, and, if possible, to exterminate vice, which had, as it were, acquired a legal establishment.
A noble enterprise!
but be wrote in a detestable age, when the laws of nature were publicly violated, and the love of their country so completely eradicated from the breasts of his fellow-citizens, that, brutified as they were by slavery and voluptuousness, by luxury and avarice, they merited rather the severity of the executioner than the censor.“
Meanwhile the empire, shaken to its foundations, was rapidly crumbling to dust.
Despotism was consecrated by the senate;
liberty, of which a few slaves were still sensible, was nothing but an unmeaning word for the rest, which, unmean­ ing as it was, they did not dare to pronounce in public.
Men of rank were declared enemies to the state for having praised their equals;
historians were condemned to the cross, phi­ losophy was proscribed, and its professors banished.
Indi­ viduals felt only for their own danger, which they too often averted by accusing others ;
and there were instances of chil­ dren who denounced their own parents, and appeared as witnesses against them !
It was not possible to weep for the proscribed, for tears themselves became the object of proscrip­ tion ;
and when the tyrant of the day had condemned the accused to banishment or death, the senate decreed that he should be thanked for it, as for an act of singular favour."
Juvenal, who looked upon the alliance of the agreeable with the odious as utterly incompatible, contemned the feeble weapon of ridicule, so familiar to his predecessor:
he there­ fore seized the sword of Satire, or, to speak more properly, fabricated one for himself, and rushing from the palace to the tavern, and from the gates of Rome to the boundaries of the empire, struck, without distinction, whoever deviated from the course of nature, or from the paths of honour.
It is no longer a poet like Horace, fickle, pliant, and fortified with that in­ difference so falsely called philosophical, who amused himself with bantering vice, or, at most, with upbraiding a few errors of little consequence, in a style, which, scarcely raised above the language of conversation, flowed as indolence and pleasure directed ;
but a stern and incorruptible censor, an inflamed and impetuous poet, who sometimes rises with his subject to the noblest heights of tragedy.
"From this declamatory applause, which even La Harpe allows to be worthy of the translator of Juvenal, the most rigid censurer of our author cannot detract much ;
nor can much perhaps be added to it by his warmest admirer.
I could, indeed, have wished that he had not exalted him at the expense of Horace ;
but something must be allowed for the partiality of long acquaintance;
and Casaubon, when he pre­ ferred Persius, with whom he had taken great, and indeed successful pains, to Horace and Juvenal, sufficiently exposed, while he tacitly accounted for, the prejudices of commentators and translators.
With respect to Horace, if he falls beneath I Juvenal (and who does not?) in eloquence, in energy, and in a vivid and glowing imagination, he evidently surpasses him in taste and critical judgment.
I could pursue the parallel through a thousand ramifications, but the reader who does me the honour to peruse the following sheets, will see that I have incidentally touched upon some of them in the notes:
and, indeed, I preferred scattering my observations through the work, as they arose from the subject, to bringing them to­ gether in this place ;
where they must evidently have lost something of their pertinency, without much certainty of gaining in their effect.
Juvenal is accused of being too sparing of praise.
But are his critics well assured that praise from Juvenal could be ac­ cepted with safety ?
I do not know that a private station was " the post of honour " in those days ;
it was, however, that of security.
Martial, Statius, V. Flaccus, and other parasites of Domitian, might indeed venture to celebrate their friends, who were also those of the emperor.
Juvenal's, it is proba­ ble, were of another kind ;
and he might have been influenced no less by humanity than prudence, in the sacred silence which he has observed respecting them.
Let it not be forgot­ ten, however, that this intrepid champion of virtue, who, under the twelfth despot, persisted, as Dusaulx observes, in recog­ nising no sovereign but the senate, while he passes by those whose safety his applause might endanger, has generously celebrated the ancient assertors of liberty, in strains that Tyrtæus might have wished his own.
He is also charged with being too rhetorical in his language.
The critics have discovered that he practised at the bar, and they will therefore have it that his Satires smack of his pro­ fession, " redolent declamatorem.”
1 That he is luxuriant, or, if it must be so, redundant, may be safely granted;
but I doubt whether the passages which are cited for proofs of this fault, were not reckoned amongst his beauties, by his contem­ poraries.
The enumeration of deities in the thirteenth Satire is well defended by Rigaltius, who admits, at the same time, that if the author had inserted it any where but in a Satire, he should have accounted him a babbler;
“faterer Juv. hic περιλαλον fuisse et verborum prodigum."
He appears to me equally successful, in justifying the list of oaths in the same Satire, which Creech, it appears, had not the courage to translate.
The other passages adduced in support of this charge, are either metaphorical exaggerations, or long traits of indirect Satire, of which Juvenal was as great a master as Horace.
I do not say that these are interesting to us;
but they were eminently so to those for whom they were written;
and by their pertinency at the time, should they, by every rule of fair criticism, be estimated.
The version of such passages is one of the miseries of translation.
I have also heard it objected to Juvenal, that there is in many of his Satires a want of arrangement;
this is particularly observed of the sixth and tenth.
I scarcely know what to reply to this.
Those who are inclined to object, would not be better satisfied, perhaps, if the form of both were changed for I suspect that there is no natural gradation in the in­ numerable passions which agitate the human breast.
Some must precede, and others follow;
but the order of march is not, nor ever was, invariable.
While I acquit him of this, however, I readily acknowledge a want of care in many places, unless it be rather attributable to a want of taste.
On some occasions, too, when he changed or enlarged his first sketch, he forgot to strike out the unnecessary verses:
to this are owing the repetitions to be found in his longer works, as well as the transpositions, which have so often perplexed the critics and translators.
Now I am upon this subject, I must not pass over a sloven­ liness in some of his lines, for which he has been justly re­ proached by Jortin and others, as it would have cost him no great pains to improve them.
Why he should voluntarily debase his poetry, it is difficult to say :
if he thought that be was imitating Horace in his laxity, his judgment must suffer considerably.
The verses of Horace are indeed akin to prose ;
but as he seldom rises, he has the art of making his low flights, in which all his motions are easy and graceful, appear the effect of choice.
Juvenal was qualified to " sit where he dared not soar."
His element was that of the eagle, “ descent and fall to him were adverse," and, indeed, he never appears more awkward than when he flutters, or rather waddles, along the ground., I have observed in the course of the translation, that he embraced no sect with warmth.
In a man of such lively pas­ sions, the retention With which be speaks of them all, is to be admired.
From his attachment to the writings of Seneca, I should incline to think that he leaned towards Stoicism ;
his predilection for the school, however, was not very strong :
perhaps it is to be wished that he had entered a little more deeply into it, as he seems not to have those distinct ideas of the nature of virtue and vice, which were entertained by many of the ancient philosophers, and indeed, by his immediate pre­ decessor, Persius.
As a general champion for virtue, he is commonly successful, but he sometimes misses his aim;
and, in more than one instance, confounds the nature of the several vices in his mode of attacking them:
he confounds too the very essence of virtue, which, in his hands, has often “ no local habitation and name," but varies with the ever-varying passions and caprices of mankind.
I know not whether it be worth while to add, that he is accused of holding a different language at different times respecting the gods, since in this he differs little from the Greek and Roman poets in general;
who, as often as they introduce their divinities, state, as Ju­ venal does, the mythological circumstances coupled with their names, without regard to the existing system of physic or morals.
When they speak from themselves, indeed, they give us exalted sentiments of virtue and sound philosophy;
when they indulge in poetic recollections, they present us with the fables of antiquity.
Hence the gods are alternately, and as the subject requires, venerable or contemptible ;
and this could not but happen through the want of some acknowledged re­ ligious standard, to which all might with confidence refer.
I come now to a more serious charge against Juvenal, that of indecency.
To hear the clamour raised against him, it might be supposed, by one unacquainted with the times, that he was the only indelicate writer of his age and country.
Yet Horace and Persius wrote with equal grossness :
yet the rigid Stoicism of Seneca did not deter him from the use of expres­ sions, which Juvenal perhaps would have rejected:
yet the courtly Pliny poured out gratuitous indecencies in his frigid hendecasyllables, which he attempts to justify by the example of a writer to whose freedom the licentiousness of Juvenal is purity!
It seems as if there was something of pique in the singular severity with which he is censured.
His pure and sublime morality operates as a tacit reproach on the generality of mankind, who seek to indemnify themselves by questioning the sanctity which they cannot but respect;
and find a secret pleasure in persuading one another that “ this dreaded sa­ tirist " was at heart no inveterate enemy to the licentiousness which he so vehemently reprehends.
When we consider the unnatural vices at which Juvenal directs his indignation, and reflect, at the same time, on the peculiar qualities of his mind, we shall not find much cause, perhaps, for wonder at the strength of his expressions.
I should resign him in silence to the hatred of mankind, if his aim, like that of too many others, whose works are read with delight, had been to render vice amiable, to fling his seducing colours over impurity, and inflame the passions by meretricious hints at what is only innoxious when exposed in native deformity:
but when I find that his views are to render depravity loath­ some ;
that every thing which can alarm and disgust is di­ rected at her in his terrible page, I forget the grossness of the execution in the excellence of the design ;
and pay my invo­ luntary homage to that integrity, which fearlessly calling in strong description to the aid of virtue, attempts to purify the passions, at the hazard of wounding delicacy and offending taste.
This is due to Juvenal:
in justice to myself, let me add, that I could have been better pleased to have had no occasion to speak at all on the subject.
Whether any considerations of this or a similar nature de­ terred our literati from turning these Satires into English, I cannot say;
but, though partial versions might be made, it was not until the beginning of the seventeenth century that a complete translation was thought of;
when two men, of ce­ lebrity in their days, undertook it about the same time;
these were Barten Holyday and Sir Robert Stapylton.
Who en­ tered first upon the task, cannot well be told.
There appears somewhat of a querulousness on both sides;
a jealousy that their versions had been communicated in manuscript to each other:
Stapylton's, however, was first published, though that of Holyday seems to have been first finished.
Of this ingenious man it is not easy to speak with too much respect.
His learning, industry, judgment, and taste are every where conspicuous :
-nor is he without a very consider­ able portion of shrewdness to season his observations.
His poetry indeed, or rather his ill-measured prose, is intolerable;
no human patience can toil through a single page of it;
1 but his notes will always be consulted with pleasure.
His work has been of considerable use to the subsequent editors of Juvenal, both at home and abroad;
and indeed, such is its general accuracy, that little excuse remains for any notorious deviation from the sense of the original.
Stapylton had equal industry, and more poetry;
but he wanted his learning, judgment, and ingenuity.
His notes, though numerous, are trite, and scarcely beyond the reach of a school-boy.
He is besides scandalously indecent on many occasions, where his excellent rival was innocently unfaithful, or silent.
With these translations, such as they were, the public was satisfied until the end of the seventeenth century, when the necessity of something more poetical becoming apparent, the booksellers, as Johnson says, " proposed a new version to the poets of that time, which was undertaken by Dryden, whose reputation was such, that no man was unwilling to serve the Muses under him.
"Dryden's account of this translation is given with such can­ dour, in the exquisite dedication which precedes it, that I shall lay it before the reader in his own words."
The common way which we have taken, is not a literal translation, but a kind of paraphrase, or somewhat which is yet more loose, betwixt a paraphrase and a translation.
Thus much may be said for us, that if we give not the whole sense of Juvenal, yet we give the most considerable part of it:
we give it, in general, so clearly, that few notes are sufficient to make us intelligible :
we make our author at least appear in a poetie dress.
We have actually made him more sounding, and more elegant, than he was before in English:
and have endeavoured to make him speak that kind of English, which he would have spoken had he lived in England, and had written to this age.
If sometimes any of us (and it is but seldom) make him express the customs and manners of his native country, rather than of Rome, it is, either when there was some kind of analogy betwixt their customs and ours, or when, to make him more easy to vulgar understandings, we gave him those manners which are familiar to us.
But I de­ fend not this innovation, it is enough if I can excuse it.
For to speak sincerely, the manners of nations and ages are not to be confounded.
”
1This is, surely, sufficiently modest.
Johnson's description of it is somewhat more favourable :
"
The general character of this translation will be given, when it is said to preserve the wit, but to want the dignity, of the original."
Is this correct ?
Dryden frequently degrades the author into a jester;
but Juvenal has few moments of levity.
Wit, indeed, he possesses in an eminent degree, but it is tinctured with his peculiarities ;
“ rarὸ jocos," as Lipsius well observes, “ sæpius acerbos sales miscet."
Dignity is the predominant quality of his mind :
he can, and does, relax with grace, but he never forgets himself;
he smiles, indeed;
but his smile is more terrible than his frown, for it is never excited but when his indignation is mingled with contempt;
" ridet et odit!"
Where his dignity, there­ fore, is wanting, his wit will be imperfectly preserved.
1
On the whole, there is nothing in this quotation to deter succeeding writers from attempting, at least, to supply the deficiencies of Dryden and his fellow-labourers ;
and, perhaps, I could point out several circumstances which might make it laudable, if not necessary:
-but this would be to trifle with the reader, who is already apprized that, as far as relates to myself, no motives but those of obedience determined me to the task for which I now solicit the indulgence of the public.
When I took up this author, I knew not of any other trans­ lator ;
nor was it until the scheme of publishing him was started, that I began to reflect seriously on the nature of what I had undertaken, to consider by what exertions I could ren­ der that useful which was originally meant to amuse, and justify, in some measure, the partiality of my benefactors.
My first object was to become as familiar as possible with my author, of whom I collected every edition that my own interest, or that of my friends, could procure ;
together with such translations as I could discover either here or abroad:
from a careful examination of all these, I formed the plan, to which, while I adapted my former labours, I anxiously strove to accommodate my succeeding ones.
Dryden has said, " if we give not the whole, yet we give the most considerable part of it."
My determination was to give the whole, and really make the work what it professed to be, a translation of Juvenal.
I had seen enough of castrated editions, to observe that little was gained by them on the score of propriety;
since, when the author was reduced to half his bulk, at the expense of his spirit and design, sufficient re­ mained to alarm the delicacy for which the sacrifice had been made.
Chaucer observes with great naivete, " Whoso shall tell a tale after a man,
He moste reherse as neighe as ever he can Everieh word, if it be in his charge, All speke he never so rudely and so large."
And indeed the age of Chaucer, like that of Juvenal, al­ lowed of such liberties.
Other times, other manners.
Many words were in common use with our ancestors, which raised no improper ideas, though they would not, and indeed could not, at this time be tolerated.
With the Greeks and Romans it was still worse:
their dress, which left many parts of the body exposed, gave a boldness to their language, which was not perhaps lessened by the infrequency of women at those social conversations, of which they now constitute the refine­ ment and the delight.
Add to this, that their mythology, and sacred rites, which took their rise in very remote periods, abounded in the undisguised phrases of a rude and simple age, and being religiously handed down from generation to gener­ ation, gave a currency to many terms, which offered no vio­ lence to modesty, though abstractedly considered by people of a different language and manners, they appear pregnant with turpitude and guilt.
When we observe this licentiousness (for I should wrong many of the ancient writers to call it libertinism) in the pages of their historians and philosophers, we may be pretty conn­ dent that it raised no blush on the cheek of their readers.
It was the language of the times—“ hæc illis natura est omnibus una:
" and if it be considered as venial in those, surely a little further indulgence will not be misapplied to the satirist, whose object is the exposure of what the former have only to notice.
Thus much may suffice for Juvenal:
but shame and sorrow on the head of him, who presumes to transfer his grossness into the vernacular tongues !
" Legimus aliqua ne legantur," was said of old, by one of a pure and zealous mind.
Without pretending to his high motives, I have felt the influence of his example, and in his apology must therefore hope to find my own.
Though the poet be given'entire, I have endea­ voured to make him speak as he would probably have spoken if he had lived among us;
when, refined with the age, he would have fulminated against impurity in terms, to which, though delicacy might disavow them, manly decency might listen without offence.
I have said above, that “ the whole of Juvenal" is here given ;
this, however, must be understood with a few restric­ tions.
Where vice, of whatever nature, formed the immediate object of reprobation, it has not been spared in the transla­ tion ;
but I have sometimes taken the liberty of omitting an exceptionable line, when it had no apparent connexion with the subject of the Satire.
Some acquaintance with the original will be necessary to discover these lacunae, which do not, in all, amount to half a page:
for the rest, I have no apologies to make.
Here are no allusions, covert or open, to the follies and vices of modern times ;
nor has the dignity of the original been prostituted, in a single instance, to the gratification of private spleen.
I have attempted to follow, as far as I judged it feasible, the style of my author, which is more various than is usually supposed.
It is not necessary to descend to particulars ;
but my meaning will be understood by those, who carefully com­ pare the original of the thirteenth and fourteenth Satires with the translation.
In the twelfth, and in that alone, I have perhaps raised it a little ;
but it really appears so contemptible a performance in the doggerel of Dryden's coadjutor, that I thought somewhat more attention than ordinary was in justice due to it.
It is not a chef-d’œuvre by any means ;
but it is a pretty and a pleasing little poem, deserving more notice than it has.
usually received.
I could have been sagacious and obscure on many occasions, with very little difficulty;
but I strenuously combated every inclination to find out more than my author meant.
The general character of this translation, if I do not deceive my­ self, will be found to be plainness;
and, indeed, the highest praise to which I aspire, is that of having left the original more intelligible to the English reader than I found it.
On numbering the lines, I find that my translation contains a few less than Dryden's.
Had it been otherwise, I should not have thought an apology necessary, nor would it perhaps appear extraordinary, when it is considered that I have in­ troduced an infinite number of circumstances from the text, which he thought himself justified in omitting;
and that, with the trifling exceptions already mentioned, nothing has been passed;
whereas he and his assistants overlooked whole see­ tions, and sometimes very considerable ones.
1
Every where, too, I have endeavoured to render the transitions less abrupt, and to obviate or disguise, the difficulties which a difference of manners, habits, &c., necessarily creates:
all this calls for an additional number of lines;
which the English reader, at least, will seldom have occasion to regret.
Of the “ borrowed learning of notes," which Dryden says he avoided as much as possible, I have amply availed myself.
During the long period in which my thoughts were fixed on Juvenal, it was usual with me, whenever I found a passage that related to him, to impress it on my memory, or to note it down.
These, on the revision of the work for publication, were added to such reflections as arose in my own mind, and arranged in the manner in which they now appear.
I confess that this was not an unpleasant task to me, and I will venture to hope, that if my own suggestions fail to please, yet the fre­ quent recurrence of some of the most striking and beautiful passages of ancient and modern poetry, history, &c., will ren­ der it neither unamusing nor uninstructive to the general reader.
The information insinuated into the mind by miscel­ laneous collections of this nature, is much greater than is usually imagined ;
and I have been frequently encouraged to proceed, by recollecting the benefits which I formerly derived from casual notices scattered over the margin, or dropped at the bottom of a page.
In this compilation, I proceeded on no regular plan, further than considering what, if I had been a mere English reader, I should wish to have had explained :
it is therefore extremely probable, as every rule of this nature must be imperfect, that I have frequently erred ;
have spoken where I should be silent, and been prolix where I should be brief:
on the whole, how­ ever, I chose to offend on the safer side ;
and to leave nothing unsaid, at the hazard of sometimes saying too much.
Tedious, perhaps, I may be;
but, I trust, not dull ;
and with this ne­ gative commendation I must be satisfied.
The passages pro­ duced are not always translated;
but the English reader needs not for that be discouraged in proceeding, as he will frequently find sufficient in the context to give him a general idea of the meaning.
In many places I have copied the words, together with the sentiments of the writer;
for this, if it call for an apology, I shall take that of Macrobius, who had some­ what more occasion for it than I shall be found to have :
“
Net:
mihi vitio vertas, si res quas ex lectione varia mutuabor, ipsis sæpè verbis quibus ab ipsis auctoribus enarratoe sunt expli­ cabo, quia proesens opus non eloquentiæ ostentationem, sed noscendorum congeriem pollicetur," &c. Saturn.
lib. i. c. 1.
I have now said all that occurs to me on this subject:
a more pleasing one remains.
I cannot, indeed, like Dryden, boast of my poetical coadjutors.
No Congreves and Creeches have abridged, while they adorned, my labours;
yet have I not been without assistance, and of the most valuable kind.
Whoever is acquainted with the habits of intimacy in which I have lived from early youth with the Rev. Dr. Ireland, 1 will not want to be informed of his share in the following pages.
To those who are not, it is proper to say, that besides the passages in which he is introduced by name, every other part of the work has been submitted to his inspection.
Nor would his affectionate anxiety for the reputation of his friend suffer any part of the translation to appear, without undergoing the strictest revision.
His uncommon accuracy, judgment, and learning have been uniformly exerted on it, not less, I am confident, to the advantage of the reader, than to my own satisfaction.
It will be seen that we sometimes differ in opi­ nion ;
but as I usually distrust my own judgment in those cases, the decision is submitted to the reader.
I have also to express my obligations to Abraham Moore, Esq., Barrister at Law, a gentleman whose taste and learning are well known to be only surpassed by his readiness to oblige:
of which I have the most convincing proofs ;
since the hours dedicated to the following sheets (which I lament that he only saw in their progress through the press) were snatched from avocations as urgent as they were important.
Nor must I overlook the friendly assistance of William Por­ den, Esq.,1 which, like that of the former gentleman, was given to me, amidst the distraction of more immediate concerns, with a readiness that enhanced the worth of what was, in itself, highly valuable.
A paper was put into my hand by Mr. George Nicol, the promoter of every literary work, from R. P. Knight, Esq., containing subjects for engravings illustrative of Juvenal, and, with singular generosity, offering me the use of his marbles, gems, &c.
As these did not fall within my plan, I can only here return him my thanks for a kindness as extraordinary as it was unexpected.
But I have other and greater obliga­ tions to Mr. Nicol.
In conjunction with his son, Mr. William Nicol, he has watched the progress of this work through the press with unwearied solicitude.
During my occasional ab­ sences from town, the correction of it (for which, indeed, the state of my eyes renders me at all times rather unfit) rested almost solely on him;
and it is but justice to add, that his habitual accuracy in this ungrateful employ is not the only quality to which I am bound to confess my obligations.
THE first Satire appears, from internal evidence, to have been written subsequently to at least the larger portion of the other Satires.
But in this, as probably in many others, lines were interpolated here and there, at a period long after the original composition of the main body of the Satire ;
the cycle of events reproducing such a combination of circumstances, that the Satirist could make his shafts come home with two- fold pungency.
For instance, the lines 60 et seq., which pro­ bably were in the first edition of the Satire directed against Nero and his favourite Sporus, would tell with equal effect against Hadrian and Antinous.
It is impossible therefore, from any one given passage, to assign a date to any of the Satires of Juvenal.
All that can be done, is to point out the allusion probably intended in the particular passages, and by that means fix a date prior to which we may reasonably conclude that portion could not have been written.
In those Satires whose subject is less complicated and ex­ tensive, a nearer approximation may be obtained to the date of the composition;
as e. g. iu the case of the second and eleventh Satires, and we may add the thirteenth and fifteenth.
But in the first Satire, the allusions extend over so wide a period, that unless we may suppose, as in the case just cited, that other persons are intended under the names known to history, to whom his readers would apply immediately the covert sarcasm, we can hardly imagine that they could all at any one given time serve to give point to the shaft of the Satirist.
Thus Crispinus, mentioned 1. 27, was made a senator by Nero, and lived probably under Domitian also.
The bar­ ber alluded to in 1. 25, (if, as the commentators suppose, Cin­ namus is the person,) must have lost all his wealth, and been reduced to poverty, some where about A. D. 93, the date of Martial’s seventh book of Epigrams (who mentions the fact, and advises him to recur to his old trade, Ep. VII. lxiv.).
Massa and Carus (1. 35, 36) are mentioned by Martial as apparently flourishing when he wrote his twelfth book, which was sent to Rome A. D. 104.
Again, line 49 seems to refer to the condemnation of Marius as a recent event;
but this took place in A. D. 100.
And in that same year M. Cornelius Fronto was consul with Trajan ;
and may have been the pro­ prietor of the plane-groves, mentioned 1. 12.
But then, again, we hear of Julius Fronto in A. D. 129, and Hadrian's conduct towards Antinous in that and the following year, might well have given occasion to the 60th and following lines;
and if we are right in applying line 40 to Plotina’s manoeuvring to secure the succession to Hadrian, it will furnish an additional argument for supposing these passages to have been added some time after.
We may therefore offer the conjecture, that the first Satire was written shortly after the year A. D. 100, as a preface or introduction to the book, and that a few ad­ ditions were made to it, even so late as thirty years subse­ quently.
The second Satire was, in all probability, the first written.
The allusion in the first line to the Sarmatæ, may perhaps be connected with the Sarmatian war, which took place A. D. 93, and in which Domitian engaged in person.
And this date will correspond with the other references in the Satire by which an approximation to the time of its composition may be obtained.
In A. D. 84 Domitian received the censorship for life, (1. 121,) at the same time that he was carrying on an incestuous intercourse with his own niece Julia.
This con­ nexion was continued for some years.
Shortly after the death of Julia, the Vestal virgin Cornelia was buried alive, A. D. 91.
These are alluded to as recent events (1. 29, " nuper”).
Agri­ cola, too, the conqueror of Britain, died A. D. 93, (cf. 1. 160,) whose campaigns are spoken of as recent occurrences, “ modo captas Orcadas."
The mention of Gracchus also connects this with the eighth Satire, part of which at least was probably written soon after the consulship of Lateranus in A. D. 94.
We may therefore conjecture that the Satire was composed between the years A. D. 93 and 95.
The third Satire may perhaps have been written in the reign of Domitian, and may refer to the general departure of men of worth from Rome, when Domitian expelled the phi­ losophers, A. D. 90.
Umbritius, who predicted the murder of Galba, A. D. 69, might have been alive at that time;
and, from his political views, would have been a friend of Juvenal, who was a bitter enemy of Otho.
The nightly deeds of violence perpetrated by Nero would have been still fresh in men's memories (1. 278, seq.;
cf. Pers. Sat. iv. 49);
as would the ju­ dicial murder of Barea SOl'anus, and the arrogance of Fabri­ cius Veiento (1. 116, 185).
Still there are other parts of the Satire that seem to bear evidence of a later date.
The name of Isæus would hardly have been so familiar in Rome till ten years after this date, 1. 74.
It was not till A. D. 107 that Trajan undertook the draining of the Pomptine marshes;
to which there is most probably an allusion in 1. 32 and 307 ;
to which nothing of importance had been done since the days of Augustus.
The great influx of foreigners into Rome, in the train of Hadrian, at a still later date, A. D. 118, probably gave rise to the spirited episode from 1. 58—125. (See Chronology.)
We may therefore consider it probable that the main body of the Satire was written towards the close of the reign of Do­ mitian, and received additions in the commencement of the reign of Hadrian.
The fourth Satire in all probability describes a real event;
and would have possessed but little interest after any great lapse of time, subsequent to the fact described.
We may therefore fairly assign it to the early part of Nerva's reign, very shortly after the death of Domitian, which is mentioned at the close of the Satire.
The fifth Satire contains nothing by which we can de­ termine the date.
From Juvenal's hatred of Domitian, we may suppose that 1. 36 was suggested by the condemnation of Senecio, who was put to death for writing a panegyric on Helvidius Priscus, A. D. 90.
If the Aurelia (1. 98) be the lady mentioned by Pliny, (Epist. ii. 20,) this would strengthen the conjecture, as Pliny's second book of Epistles was pro­ bably written very shortly before that date.
There is little doubt that considerable portions of the sixth Satire were written in the reign of Trajan.
1. The lines 407—411 describe exactly the events that took place at Anti­ och, in A. D. 115, when Trajan was entering on his Armenian and Parthian campaigns.
2. The coins of Trajan of the year A. D. 110, have the legend Dacicus and Germanicus, cf. 1. 205 ;
and although Domitian triumphed over the Dacians and Ger­ mans, none of his extant coins bear that inscription ;
the ge­ neral title being Augustus Germanicus simply.
3. Again, 1. 502 describes a kind of head-dress, very common on the coins of the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian, representing Plotina the wife of Trajan, Marciana his sister, and Sabina the wife of Hadrian, and others:
and this fashion was a very short-lived one.
Beginning with the court, it probably soon descended to the ladies of inferior rank;
but like its unnatural antitype, the towering, powdered, and plastered rolls of our own country­ women, in the degraded days of the two first Georges, it was too unnatural and disfiguring to remain long in vogue with that sex, to whom " tanta est quærendi cura decoris tanquam famæ discrimen agatur aut animæ.”
4. The subject itself also affords an additional reason for supposing that the Satire was composed when the poet was advanced in life.
The vices of women are hardly a topic for a young writer to select:
but the vigorous manner in which he handles the lash, rather marks the state of mind of the man who has outgrown the passions of early manhood, and from "the high heaven of his philosophy ” looks down with cold austerity on the desires, and with bitter indignation at the vices, of those whose feelings he has long since ceased to share.
Juvenal was, as Hodgson says, " an impenetrable bachelor," and if, as he conjectures, he was jilted in his early youth, this fact would give additional bitterness to the rancour which in old age he would feel towards the sex by whom his personal happiness had been embittered, as well as the ruin of his native country precipitated.
5. If we are right in supposing that by Heliodorus, Juvenal meant Artemi­ dorus Capito, (and the change in the name is both simple and readily suggested,) this would also bring down the date of this Satire to Juvenal's later years, as about A. D. 122 was the time when this court-physician of Hadrian had attained his greatest reputation.
6. In line 320, Saufeia is spoken of in similar terms to those employed in the eleventh Satire, which was confessedly the work of his later years.
7. Compare also the mention of Archigenes (1. 236) with the 98th line of the thirteenth Satire, written A. D. 118.
8. The allusions to the importation of foreigners, with their exotic vices, would also refer to the same date.
See Chron. A. D. 118.
The date of the seventh Satire will depend mainly on the question, Whom does Juvenal intend to panegyrize in his 1st line ? "
Et spes et ratio studiorum in Cæsare tantum."
Gifford pronounces unhesitatingly in favour of Domitian, and his argument is very plausible.
“ The Satire," he says, " would appear to have been written in the early part of Domitian's reign ;
and Juvenal, by giving the emperor ' one honest line' of praise, probably meant to stimulate him to extend his pa­ tronage.
He did not think very ill of him at the time, and augured happily for the future."
Juvenal's subsequent hatred of Domitian was caused, he thinks, by his bitter mortification at finding, in a few years, this “ sole patron of literature " changed into a ferocious and bloody persecutor of all the arts.
This opinion he supports by some references to contemporary writers, and by the evidence of coins of Domitian existing with a head of Pallas on the reverse, to symbolize his royal patronage of poetry and literary pursuits.
But in almost every instance Gifford errs in assigning too early a date to the Satires ;
and one or two points in this clearly show that we must bring it down to a much later period.
Domitian suc­ ceeded to the throne A. D. 81, and it could only have been in the earlier years of his reign that even his most servile flat­ terers could have complimented him upon his patronage of learning.
Now, 1. It was not till about ten years after this that the actor Paris acquired his influence and his wealth;
and even allowing the very problematical story of the banish­ ment of Juvenal having been caused by the offence given to the favourite by the famous lines (85—92) to be true, this would bring it down to a time subsequent to the banishment of philosophers from Rome ;
after which act Juvenal, cer­ tainly, would not have written the first line on Domitian.
2. Again, in A. D. 90, Quintilian was teaching in a public school at Rome, and receiving a salary from the imperial treasury ;
it could hardly therefore be so early as this date that he had acquired the fortune and estates alluded to in 1.
189. 3. In 1. 82, the Thebaid of Statius is mentioned.
This poem was finished A. D. 94;
and though it is true that Statins might, most probably, have publicly recited portions of it during its progress, it would have hardly earned the great reputation implied in Juvenal's lines, at a sufficiently early date to allow us to assign it to the first two or three years of Domitian's reign.
I should, therefore, rather suppose that by Cæsar we are to understand Nerva.
The praise of Domitian is incompatible with Juvenal's universal hatred and execration of him.
The opening of the reign of the mild and excellent Nerva might well inspire hopes of the revival of a taste for literature and the arts;
and I would conjecture the close of A. D. 96 as the date of the Satire.
Before the end of the year Statius was dead;
but Juvenal's words seem to imply that he was still living.
Again,
Matho the lawyer has failed, and is in great poverty, (l. 129,) to which Martial alludes in lib.
xi. Ep., part of which book was evidently written shortly before A. D. 97.
But if we are right in supposing the first Satire to have been written about A. D. 100, the intervening years will have given Matho ample time to retrieve his fortune by his infamous trade of informing, and reappear as the luxurious character described Sat. i. 32.
Of the eighth Satire, if " Lateranus " be the true reading, (1. 147,) or if be be intended by " Damasippus," as I believe, we may assume the year A. D. 101 or 102 as the probable date:
Lateranus had been consul A. D. 94, and in the year A. D. 101 Trajan for the first time extended the arms of Rome beyond the Danube.
Cf. 1. 169.
The plunder of his province of Africa, by Marius Priscus, was a recent event (1. 120 " nuper ");
but, as we have said above, he was impeached by Pliny and Tacitus in the year A. D. 100.
Ponticus, to whom the Satire is addressed, may be the person to whom Martial refers in his twelfth book, which was written A. D. 104.
There are two allusions by which we may form a conjecture as to the date of the ninth Satire.
Crepereius Pollio is men­ tioned as nearly in the same circumstances of profligate po­ verty (1. 6, 7) as is described in the eleventh Satire, (1. 43,) which was undoubtedly written in Juvenal's later years;
and he alludes (1. 117) to Saufeia, in very much the same terms in which he speaks of her in the sixth Satire, (1. 320,) which we suppose to have been written in his old age.
The internal evidence, supplied by the sustained majesty and dignified flow of language of the tenth (as well as of the fourteenth) Satire, without taking into consideration the phi­ losophical nature of the subject of both, is quite sufficient to prove that they must have been the finished productions of a late period of a thoughtful life.
We are therefore quite pre­ pared to admit the conjecture that the allusion in line 136 is to the column of Trajan, erected in the year A. D. 113.
The repetition of the line (226) also connects this with the first Satire, which it probably preceded only by a short interval.
The 203rd line of the eleventh Satire fixes its date to the later years of Juvenal's life.
It breathes, besides, throughout the spirit of a calm and philosophic enjoyment of the blessings of life, that tells of declining age ;
cheered by a chastened ap­ preciation of the comforts by which it is surrounded, but far removed from all extraneous or meretricious excitement, and utterly abhorrent of all noisy or exuberant hilarity.
An ad­ ditional argument is mentioned in the Chronology for referring it to the date A. D. 124.
The twelfth Satire contains nothing by which we can fix its date with any certainty.
If, however, as the commentators suppose, the wife of Fuscus, in the 45th line, be Saufeia, it will be connected with the sixth, ninth, and eleventh Satires, and may probably be considered the work of his advanced age.
The thirteenth Satire is fixed by line 17 to the year A. D. 118, the 60th after the consulship of L. Fonteius Capito.
This is the only Satire to which Mr. Clinton has assigned a date.
The argument applied to the tenth Satire will apply with nearly equal force to the fourteenth.
We are therefore prepared to admit the plausibility of the conjecture, that 1. 196 refers to the progress of Hadrian through Britain, which would fix the date to A. D. 120;
a very short time previous to the compo­ sition of the following Satire.
The event recorded in the fifteenth Satire occurred shortly after the consulship of Junius, 1. 27, " nuper consule Junio gesta."
This was, in all probability, Junius Rusticus, who was consul with Hadrian A. D. 119.
The 110th line also probably refers to the influx of Greeks and other foreigners into Rome, in the train of Hadrian, (to which we have alluded in discussing the date of the third Satire,) which took place in the preceding year.
The sixteenth Satire may have either been the draught of a longer poem, commenced in early life, (as 1. 3 may imply,) which the poet never cared to finish ;
or an outline for a more perfect composition, which he never lived to elaborate.
The mention of Fuscus may connect it with the twelfth Satire.
But though there is quite enough remaining to warrant us in unhesitatingly ascribing the authorship to Juvenal, there is too little left to enable us to form even a probable conjecture as to the date of its composition.
It is hardly necessary to add, that, after a careful examina­ tion of the foregoing Chronology, it must be evident to every novice in scholarship, that the whole life of Juvenal, as usually given, is a mere myth, to which one cannot even apply, as in many legendary biographies, the epithet of poetical.
THIS Satire seems, from several incidental circumstances, to have been produced subsequently to most of them;
and was probably drawn up after the author had determined to collect and publish his works, as a kind of Introduction.
He abruptly breaks silence with an impassioned complaint of the im­ portunity of bad writers, and a resolution of retaliating upon them;
and after ridiculing their frivolous taste in the choice of their subjects, declares his own intention to devote himself to Satire.
After exposing the cor­ ruption of men, the profligacy of women, the luxury of courtiers, the baseness of informers and fortune-hunters, the treachery of guardians, and the peculation of-officers of state, he censures the general passion for gambling, the servile rapacity of the patricians, the avarice and gluttony of the rich, and the miserable poverty and subjection of their dependents;
and after some bitter reflections on the danger of satirizing living villany, concludes with a resolution to attack it under the mask of departed names.
This Satire contains an animated attack upon the hypocrisy of the phi­ losophers and reformers of the day, whose ignorance, profligacy, and impiety it exposes with just severity.
Domitian is here the object;
his vices are alluded to under every dif­ ferent name ;
and it gives us a high opinion of the intrepid spirit of the man who could venture to circulate, even in private, so faithful a repre­ sentation of that blood-thirsty tyrant.
Umbritius, an Aruspex and friend of the author, disgusted at the pre­ valence of vice and the disregard of unassuming virtue, is on the point of quitting Rome;
and when a little way from the city, stops short to acquaint the poet, who has accompanied him, with the causes of his re­ tirement.
These may be arranged under the following heads :
-That Flattery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome ;
in these, especially the first, foreigners have a manifest superiority over the natives, and con­ sequently engross all favour-that the poor are universally exposed to scorn and insult-that the general habits of extravagance render it diffi­ cult for them to subsist-that the want of a well-regulated police subjects them to numberless miseries and inconveniences, aggravated by the crowded state of the capital, from all which a country life is happily free on the tranquillity and security of which he dilates with great beauty.
In this Satire Juvenal indulges his honest spleen against Crispinus, already noticed, and Domitian, the constant object of his scorn and ab­ horrence.
The introduction of the tyrant is excellent;
the mock solem­ nity with which the anecdote of the Turbot is introduced, the procession of the affrighted counsellors to the palace, and the ridiculous debate which terminates in as ridiculous a decision, show a masterly hand.
The whole concludes with an indignant and high-spirited apostrophe.
Under pretence of advising one Trebius to abstain from the table of Virro, a man of rank and fortune, Juvenal takes occasion to give a spirit­ ed detail of the insults and mortifications to which the poor were subjected by the rich, at those entertainments to which, on account of the political connexion subsisting between patrons and clients, it was sometimes thought necessary to invite them.
The whole of this Satire, not only the longest, but the most complete of the author's works, is directed against the female sex.
It may be dis­ tributed under the following heads :
—Lust variously modified, imperious­ ness of disposition, fickleness, gallantry, attachment to improper pursuits, litigiousness, drunkenness, unnatural passions, fondness for singers, dancers, &c.;
gossiping, cruelty, ill manners;
outrageous pretensions to criticism, grammar, and philosophy;
superstitious and unbounded cre­ dulity in diviners and fortune-tellers;
introducing supposititious children ;
poisoning their step-sons to possess their fortunes ;
and lastly, murdering their husbands.
This Satire contains an animated account of the general discourage­ ment under which literature laboured at Rome.
Beginning with poetry, it proceeds through the various departments of history, law, oratory, rhetoric, and grammar;
interspersing many curious anecdotes, and en­ livening each different head with such satirical, humorous, and senti­ mental remarks as naturally flow from the subject.
Juvenal demonstrates, in this Satire, that distinction is merely per­ sonal ;
that though we may derive rank and titles from our ancestors, yet if we degenerate from the virtues by which they obtained them, we cannot be considered truly noble.
This is the main object of the Satire;
which, however, branches out into many collateral topics-the profligacy of the young nobility ;
the miserable state of the provinces, which they plundered and harassed without mercy;
the contrast between the state of debasement to which the descendants of the best families had sunk, and the opposite virtues to be found in persons of the lowest station and humblest descent.
The Satire consists of a dialogue between the poet and one Nævolus, a dependent of some wealthy debauchee, who, after making him subser­ vient to his unnatural passions, in return starved, insulted, hated, and discarded him.
The whole object seems to be, to inculcate the grand moral lesson, that, under any circumstances, a life of sin is a life of slavery.
The subject of this inimitable Satire is the vanity of human wishes.
From the principal events of the lives of the most illustrious characters of all ages, the poet shows how little happiness is promoted by the attain­ ment of what our indistinct and limited views represent as the greatest of earthly blessings.
Of these he instances wealth, power, eloquence, military glory, longevity, and personal accomplishments;
all of which, he shows, have proved dangerous or destructive to their respective pos­ sessors.
Hence he argues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations of Heaven ;
and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he points out with great force and beauty the objects for which a rational being may presume to approach the Almighty.
Under the form of an invitation to his friend Persicus, Juvenal takes occasion to enunciate many admirable maxims for the due regulation of life.
After ridiculing the miserable state to which a profligate patrician had reduced himself by his extravagance, he introduces the picture of his own domestic economy, which he follows by a pleasing view of the sim­ plicity of ancient manners, artfully contrasted with the extravagance and luxury of the current times.
After describing with great beauty the en­ tertainment he proposes to give his friend, he concludes with an earnest recommendation to him to enjoy the present with content, and await the future with calmness and moderation.
Catullus, a valued friend of the poet, had narrowly escaped shipwreck.
In a letter of rejoicing to their common friend, Corvinus, Juvenal de­ scribes the danger that his friend had incurred, and his own hearty and disinterested delight at his preservation, contrasting his own sacrifices of thanksgiving at the event, with those offered by the designing legacy- hunters, by which the rich and childless were attempted to be insnared.
Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidential per­ son, who, when he came to re-demand it, forswore the deposit.
The in­ dig'nation and fury expressed by Calvinus at this breach of trust, reached the ears of his friend Juvenal, who endeavours to soothe and comfort him under his loss.
The different topics of consolation follow one another naturally and forcibly, and the horrors of a troubled conscience were per­ haps never depicted with such impressive solemnity as in this Satire.
The whole of this Satire is directed to the one great end of self-im­ provement.
By showing the dreadful facility with which children copy the vices of their parents, the poet points out the necessity as well as the sacred duty of giving them examples of domestic purity and virtue.
After briefly enumerating the several vices, gluttony, cruelty, debauchery, &c., which youth imperceptibly imbibe from their seniors, he enters more at large into that of avarice;
of which he shows the fatal and inevitable consequences.
Nothing can surpass the exquisiteness of this division of the Satire, in which he traces the progress of that passion in the youthful mind from the paltry tricks of saving a broken meal to the daring violation of every principle, human and divine.
Having placed the absurdity as well as the danger of immoderate desires in every point of view, he con­ cludes with a solemn admonition to rest satisfied with those comforts and conveniences which nature and wisdom require, and which a decent competence is easily calculated to supply.
After enumerating with great humour the animal and vegetable gods of the Egyptians, the author directs his powerful ridicule at their sottish and ferocious bigotry;
of which he gives an atrocious and loathsome example.
The conclusion of the Satire, which is a just and beautiful description of the origin of civil society, (infinitely superior to any thing that Lucretius or Horace has delivered on the subject,) founded not on natural instinct, but on principles of mutual benevolence implanted by God in the breast of man, and of man alone, does honour to the genius, good sense, and enlightened morality of the author.
Under a pretence of pointing out to his friend Gallus the advantages of a military life, Juvenal attacks with considerable spirit the exclusive privileges which the army had acquired or usurped, to the manifest injury of the civil part of the community.

Shall I never retaliate,1 though plagued so often with the Theseid of Codrus,2 hoarse with reciting it?

But if old laws and statutes are to be raked up,2 before all others the Scatinian ought to be revived.
First scrutinize and look into the conduct of the men.
They commit the greater atrocities;
but it is their number protects them, and their phalanxes close serried with their shields.
There is a wonderful unanimity amongst these effeminates.
You will not find one single instance of such execrable conduct in our sex.
3 Tædia does not caress Cluvia, nor Flora Catulla.
Hispo acts both sex's parts, and is pale with two-handed lust.
Do ue ever plead causes?
Do we study civil law?
or dis­ turb your courts with any clamour of our tongues ?
A few of us perhaps may wrestle, or diet themselves on the trainer's food;
but only a few.
You men, you spin wool, and carry home in women's baskets your finished tasks.
You men twist the spindle big with its fine-drawn thread more deftly than Penelope, more nimbly than Arachne ;
work, such as the dirty drab does that sits crouching on her log.
Every one knows why Hister at his death made his freedman his sole heir, while, when alive, he gave his maiden wife1 so many presents.
She will be rich, without a doubt, who will submit to lie third in the wide bed.
Get married then, and hold your tongue, and ear-rings 2 will be the guerdon of your silence !
And after all this, forsooth, a heavy sentence is to be passed on us women!
Censure acquits the raven, but falls foul of the dove!
"From this rebuke so true and undeniable, the counterfeit Stoics recoiled in confusion.
For what grain of untruth was there in Lauronia's words ?
Yet, what will not others do, when thou, Creticus, adoptest muslin robes, and to the amaze­ ment of the people, inveighest in such a dress against Procula or Pollinea ?
Fabulla, thou sayest, is an adulteress.
Then let her be condemned, if you will have it so, and Carfinia also.
Yet though condemned, she would not put on such a dress as that.
“ But it is July, it is raging hot, I am on fire !"
Then plead stark naked !
3
To be thought mad would be a less disgrace !
Is that a dress to propound laws and statutes in, in the ears of the people when flushed with victory, with their wounds yet green, or that noble race, fresh from their ploughs ?
What an outcry would you make, if yon saw such a dress on the person of a Judex!
I ask, would such a robe be suitable even in a witness?
Creticus!
the implacable, the indomit­ able, the champion of liberty, is transparent!
Contagion has caused this plague-spot, and will extend it to many more, just as a whole flock perishes in the fields from the scab of one sheep, or pigs from mange, and the grape contracts the taint from the grape it comes in contact with.
Ere long you will venture on something more disgraceful even than this dress.
No one ever reached the climax of vice at one step.
You will by degrees enter the band of those who wear at home long fillets round their brows, and cover their necks with jewels, and propitiate Bona Dea with the belly of a young sow and a huge bowl of wine ;
but by an inversion of the old custom Women, kept far aloof, dare not cross the threshold.
The altar of the goddess is accessible to males alone.
" With­ draw, profane females !" is the cry.
No minstrel here may make her cornet sound !
Such were the orgies by the secret torch-light which the Baptæ celebrated, who used to weary out even the Athenian Cotytto.
1
One with needle held oblique adds length to his eyebrows touched with moistened soot, and raising the lids paints his quivering eyes.
Another drains a Priapus-shaped glass, and confines his long thick hair with a caul of gold thread, clothed in sky-blue checks, or close-piled yellow stuffs;
while his attendant also swears by Juno, the patron deity of his master.
Another holds a mirror, the weapon wielded by the pathic Otho, “ the spoil of Auruncan Actor,"2 in which he surveyed himself when fully armed, before he gave the signal to engage,-a thing worthy to be recorded in the latest annals and history of the day.
A mirror !
fit baggage for a civil war !
0 yes, forsooth !
to kill old Galba shows the consummate general, to pamper one's complexion is the consistent occupation of the first citizen of Rome;
to aspire to the empire as the prize on Bebriacum's 3 plains, and then spread over his face a poultice applied with his fingers !
Such an act as neither the quivered Semiramis perpetrated in the Assyrian realms, or Cleopatra flying de­ jected in her Actian galley.
Among this crew there is neither decency of language, nor respect for the proprieties of the table.
Here is the foul licence that Cybele enjoins, the lisping speech, the aged priest with hoary hair, like one pos­ sessed, a prodigy of boundless appetite, open to hire.
Yet why do they delay ?
since long ago they ought after the Phrygian custom to have removed with their knives the superfluous flesh.
Gracchus4 gave four hundred sestertia as his dowry, with himself, to a bugler, or else one that blew the straight trumpet.
The marriage deeds were duly signed, the blessing invoked, a great dinner provided, the lie-bride lay in the bridegroom's arms.
a nobles!
is it a censor we need, or an aruspex ?
You would without doubt be horrified, and deem it a prodigy of portentous import, if a woman gave birth to a calf, or a cow to a lamb.
The same Gracchus puts on flounces, the long robe and flame-coloured 1 veil, who, when bearing the sacred shields swinging with mysterious thong, sweated be­ neath the Ancilia !
Oh !
father of our city !
whence came such heinous guilt to the shepherds of Latium ?
Whence, a Gradivus, came this unnatural lust that has tainted thy race ?
See !
a man illustrious in birth and rank is made over to a man!
Dost thou neither shake thy helmet, nor smite the earth with thy lance ?
Dost thou not even appeal to thy father Jove ?
Begone then !
and quit the acres of the Campus once so severe, which thou ceasest to care for !
“
I have some duty-work to perform to-morrow at break of day in the Quirinal valley."
" What is the occasion ?" "
Why ask ?
my friend is going to be married;
only a few are invited !"
If we only live to see it, these things will be done in the broad light of day, and claim to be registered in the public acts.
Meanwhile, there is one grievous source of pain that clings to these male-brides, that they are incapable of bearing, and re­ taining their lords' affections by bringing them children.
No !
better is it that nature in this case gives their minds no power over their bodies !
They must die barren !
Vain, in their case, is fat Lyde with her medicated box ;
vain the hold­ ing out their hands to the nimble Luperci.
Yet even this prodigy of crime is surpassed by the trident of Gracchus in his gladiator's tunica when in full flight he traverses the middle of the arena.
Gracchus !
more nobly born than the Manlii, and Marcelli, and Catulus' and Paulus' race, and the Fabii, and all the spectators in the front row.
Ay, even though you add to these the very man himself, at whose expense he cast his net as Retiarius.
That there are departed spirits, and realms beneath the earth,-that Charon's pole exists, and the foul frogs in the Stygian whirlpool,—and that so many thousand souls cross its waters in a single bark, not even boys believe, 'save those as yet too young to be charged for their bath.
1
But do thou believe them true !
What does Curius feel, and the two Scipios, what Fabricius and the shades of Camillus, what the legion cut off at Cremera, and the flower of Roman youth slaughtered at Cannæ—so many martial spirits—what do they feel, when such a shade as this passes from us ito them ?
They would long to be cleansed from the pollution of the contact, could any sulphur and pine-torches be supplied to them, or could there be a bay-tree to sprinkle them with water.
To such a pitch of degradation are we come !2
We have, indeed, advanced our arms beyond Juvertia's shore, and the Orcades3 recently subdued, and the Britons content with night contracted to its briefest span.
But those abominations which are committed in the victorious people's city are un­ known to those barbarians whom we have conquered.]“
Yet there is a story told of one, an Armenian Zalates, who, more effeminate than the rest of his young countrymen, is reported to have yielded to the tribune's lust."
See the result of in­ tercourse with Rome !
He came a hostage !
Here they learn to be men!
For if a longer tarry in the city be granted to these youths, they will never lack a lover.
Their plaids, and knives, and bits, and whips, will soon be discarded.
•
Thus it is the vices of our young nobles are aped even at Artaxata.
4ALTHOUGH troubled at the departure of my old friend, yet I cannot but commend his intention of fixing his abode at Cumæ, now desolate, and giving the Sibyl one citizen at least.
It is the high road to Baiæ, and has a pleasant shore ;
a de­ lightful retreat.- I prefer even Prochyta1 to the Suburra.
For what have we ever looked on so wretched or so lonely, that you would not deem it worse to be in constant dread of fires, the perpetual falling-in of houses, and the thousand dangers of the cruel city,2 andpoets spouting in the month of August.
3
But while his whole household is being stowed in a single waggon, my friend Umbritius halted at the ancient tri­ umphal arches 4 and the moist Capena.
Here, where Numa used to make assignations with his nocturnal mistress, the grove of the once-hallowed fountain and the temples are in our days let out to Jews, whose whole furniture is a basket and bundle of hay.
5
For every single tree is bid to pay a rent to the people, and the Camenæ having been ejected, the wood is one mass of beggars.
We descended into the valley of Egeria and the grottoes, so altered from what nature made them.
How much more should we feel the influence of the presiding genius of the spring,6 if turf enclosed the waters with its margin of green, and no marble profaned the native tufa Here then Umbritius began :
7"
Since at Rome there is no place for honest pursuits, no profit to be got by honest toil—my fortune is less to-day than it was yesterday, and to-morrow must again make that little less—we purpose emigrating to the spot where Dædalus put off his wearied wings, while my grey hairs are still but few, my old age green and erect;
while something yet remains for Lachesis to spin, and I can bear myself on my own legs, without a staff to support my right hand.
Let us leave our native land.
There let Arturius and Catulus live.
Let those continue in it who turn black to white;
for whom it is an easy matter to get contracts for building temples, clear­ ing rivers, constructing harbours,l cleansing the sewers, the furnishing a funeral,2 and under the mistress-spear set up the slave to sale.”
3These fellows, who in former days were horn-blowers, and constant attendants on the municipal amphitheatres, and whose puffed cheeks were well known through all the towns, now themselves exhibit gladiatorial shows, and when the thumbs of the rabble are turned up, let any man be killed to court the mob.
Returned from thence, they farm the public jakes...And why not every tiling ?
Since these are the men whom Fortune, whenever she is in a sportive mood, raises from the dust to the highest pinnacle of greatness.
4.What shall I do at Rome ?
I cannot lie ;
if a book is bad, I cannot praise it and beg a copy.
I know not the motions of the stars.
I neither will nor can promise a man'to secure his father's death.
I never inspected the entrails of a toad.
5
Let others understand how to bear to a bride the messages and presents of the adulterer;
no one shall be a thief by my co-operation;
and therefore I go forth, a companion to no man,1 as though I were crippled, and a trunk useless from its right hand being disabled.
2Who, now-a-days, is beloved except the confidant of crime, and he whose raging mind3 is boiling with things concealed, and that must never be divulged.?
He that has made you the partaker of an honest secret, thinks that he owes you nothing, and nothing will he ever pay..
He will be Verres' dear friend, who can accuse Verres at any time lie pleases.
Yet set not thou so high a price on all the sands of shady Tagus,4 and the gold rolled down to the sea, as to lose your sleep, and to your sorrow take bribes that ought to be spurned,5 and be always dreaded by your powerful friend..
(What class of men is now most welcome to our rich men, and whom I would especially shun, I will soon tell you;
nor shall shame prevent me.
6
It is that the city is become Greek, Quirites, that I cannot tolerate ;
and yet how small the proportion even of the dregs of Greece !
Syrian Orontes has long since flowedinto the Tiber and brought with it its language, morals, and the crooked harps with the flute-player, and its national tambourines, and girls made to stand for hire at the Circus.
Go thither, ye who fancy a barbarian harlot with embroidered turban. (.
That rustic of thine, Quirinus, takes his Greek suwper-eloak, and wears Greek prizes on his neck besmeared with Ceroma.
1
One forsaking steep Sicyon, another Amydon, a third from Andros, another from Samos, another again from Tralles, or Alabanda,2 swarm to Esquiliae, and the hill called from its osiers, destined to be the very vitals, and future lords of great houses.
3
These have a quick wit, desperate impudence, a ready speech, more rapidly fluent even than Isæus.4
Tell me what you fancy he is ?
He has brought with him whatever character you wish-grammarian, rhetorician, geometer, painter, trainer,5 soothsayer, rope- dancer, physician, wizard—he knows every thing.
Bid the hungry Greekling go to heaven !
He '11 go.6
In short, it was - neither Moor, nor Sarmatian, nor Thracian, that took wings, but one born in the heart of AthensJ Shall I not shun these men's purple robes ?
Shall this fellow take precedence of me in signing his name, and.
recline pillowed on a more honour­ able couch than I, though imported to Rome by the same wind that brought the plums and figs?
8
Does it then go so utterly for nothing, that my infancy inhaled the air of Aven­ tine, nourished on the Sabine berry ?
Why add that this nation, most deeply versed in flattery, praises the conversa­ tion of an ignorant, the -face of a hideously ugly friend, and compares some weak fellow's crane-like neck to the brawny shoulders of Hercules, holding Antæus far from his mother Earth:
and is in raptures at the squeaking voice,9 not a whit superior in sound to that of the cock as he bites the hen.
We may, it is true, praise the same things, if we choose.
But they are believed.
Can he be reckoned a better actor,1 when he takes the part of Thais, or acts the wife in the play, or Doris 2 without her robe.
It is surely a woman in reality that seems to speak, and not a man personifying one.
LYou would swear it was a woman, perfect in all respects.
In their coun­ try, neither Antiochus, nor Stratocles, or Demetrius and the effeminate Hæmus, would call forth admiration.
For there every man's an actor.
Do you smile ?
He is convulsed with a laugh far more hearty.
If he spies a tear in his friend's eye, he bursts into a flood of weeping ;
though in reality he feels no grief.
If at the winter solstice you ask for a little fire, he calls for his thick coat.
If you say, I am hot!
he breaks into a sweat.
Therefore we are not fairly matched;
he has the best of it, who can at any time, either by night or day, assume a fictitious face;
kiss his hands in ecstasy, quite ready to praise his patron's grossest acts;
if the golden cup has emitted a sound, when its bottom is inverted.
Besides, there is nothing that is held sacred by these fel­ lows, or that is safe from their lust.
Neither the mistress of the house, nor your virgin daughter, nor her suitor, unbearded as yet, nor your son, heretofore chaste.
If none of these are to be found, he assails his friend's grandmother.
They aim at learning the secrets of the house, and from that knowledge be feared,And since we have begun to make mention of the Greeks, pass on to their schools of philosophy, and hear the foul crime of the more dignified cloak.
3
It was a Stoic that killed Bareas—the informer, his personal friend-the old man, his own pupil-bred on that shore4 on which the pinion of the Gorgonean horse lighted.
There is no room for any Roman here, where some Protogenes, or Diphilus, or Erimanthus reigns supreme;
who, with the common vice of his race, never shares a friend, but engrosses him entirely to himself.
For when he has infused into his patron's too ready ear one little drop of the venom of his nature and his country, I am ejected from the door;
all my long-protracted -service goes for nought.
No where is the loss of a client of less account.
Besides (not to flatter ourselves) what service can the poor man render, what merit can he plead, even though he be zealous enough to hasten in his toga1 before break of day, when the very prætor himself urges on his lictor, and bids him hurry on with headlong speed, since the childless matrons have been long awake, lest his colleague2 be before-hand with him in paying his respects to Albina and Modia.
Here, by the side of a slave, if only rich, walks the son of the free­ born;
3 for the other gives to Calvina, or Catiena, (that-he may enjoy her once or twice,) as much as the tribunes in the legion receive ;
4 whereas you, when the face of a well-dressed harlot takes your fancy, hesitate to hand Chione from her exalted seat.
Produce me at Rome a witness of as blameless integrity as the host of the Idæan deity;
5 let Numa stand forth, or he that rescued Minerva when in jeopardy from her temple all in flames :
the question first put would be as to his income, that about his moral character would come last of all.
“How many slaves does he keep ?
How many acres of public land does he occupy?
6
With how many and what expensive dishes is his table spread ? "
In exact proportion to the sum of money a man keeps in his chest, is the credit given to his oath.
Though you were to swear by all the altars of the Samo- thracian and our own gods, the poor man is believed to despise the thunder-bolts and the gods, even with the sanc­ tion of the gods themselves.
Why add that this same poor man famishes material and grounds for ridicule to all, if his cloak is dirty and torn, if his toga is a little soiled, and one shoe gapes with its upper leather burst;
or if more than one patch displays the coarse fresh darning thread, where a rent has been sewn up.
Poverty, bitter though it be, has no sharper pang than this, that it makes men ridiculous. "
Let him retire, if he has any shame left, and quit the cushions of the knights, that has not the income required by the Jaw, and let these seats be taken by"—the sons of pimps, in whatever- brothel born !
Here let the son of the sleek crier applaud among the spruce youths of the gladiator, and the scions of the fencing-school.
Such is the will of the vain Otlio, who made the distinction between us.
Who was ever allowed at Rome to become a son-in-law if his estate was inferior, and not a match for the portion of the young lady ?
What poor man's name appears in any will ?
When is he summoned to a consultation even by an ædile ?
All Quirites that are poor, ought, long ago to have emigrated in a body.
3
Difficult indeed is it for those to emerge from obscurity whose noble qualities are cramped by narrow means at home ;
I but at Rome, for men like these, the attempt is still more hopeless;
it is only at an exorbitant price they can get a wretched lodging, keep for their servants, and a frugal meal.
4
A man is ashamed here to dine off pottery ware,5 which, were he suddenly transported to the Marsi and a Sa­ bine board, contented there with a coarse bowl of blue earthen­ ware, he would no longer deem discreditable.
There is a large portion of Italy, (if we allow the fact,) where no one puts on the toga, except the dead.
6
Even when the very majesty of festival days is celebrated in a theatre reared of turf, 1 and the well-known farce at length returns to the stager when the rustic infant on its mother's lap is terrified at the wide mouth of the ghastly mask, there you will see all costumes equal and alike, both orchestra and common people.
White tunics are quite sufficient as the robe of distinction for the highest personages there, even the very ædiles.
Here, in Rome, the splendour of dress is carried beyond men's means ;
here, something more than is enough, is taken occasionally from another's chest.
In this fault all participate.
Here we all live with a poverty that apes our betters.
Why should I detain you ?
Every thing at Rome is coupled with high price.
What have you to give, that you may occasionally pay your respects to Cossus ?
that Veiento may give you a passing glance, though without deigning to open his mouth ?
One shaves the beard, another deposits the hair of a favourite;
the house is full of venal cakes.
3
Now learn this fact, and keep it to work within your breast.
We clients are forced to pay tribute and increase the private income of these pampered slaves.
Who dreads, or ever did dread, the falling of a house at cool Proeneste, or at Volsinii seated amongst the well-wooded hills, or simple Gabii,4 or the heights of sloping Tibur.
We, in Rome, inhabit a city propped in great measure on a slender shore.
5
For so the steward props, up the falling walls,6 and when he has plastered over the old and gaping crack, bids us sleep without sense of danger while ruin hangs over our heads!
7
I must live in a place, where there are no fires, no nightly alarms.
Already is Ucalegon shouting for water, already is he removing his chattels:
the third story in the house you live in is already in a blaze.
Yet you are uncon­ scious !
For if the alarm begin from the bottom of the stairs, he will be the last to be burnt whom a single tile protects from the rain, where the tame pigeons lay their eggs.
Co­ drus had a bed too small for his Procula, six little jugs the ornament of his sideboard, and a little can besides beneath it, t and a Chiron reclining under the same marble;
and a chest now grown old in the service contained his Greek books, and opic1 mice gnawed poems of divine inspiration.
Codrus possessed nothing at all;
who denies the fact ?
and yet all that little nothing that he had, he lost.
But the climax that;
crowns his misery is the fact, that though he is stark naked and begging for a few scraps, no one will lend a hand to help him to bed and board.
But, if the great mansion of Asturius has fallen, the matrons appear in weeds,2 the senators in < mourning robes, the prætor adjourns the courts.
Then it is we groan for the accidents of the city;
then we loathe the very name of fire.
The fire is still raging, and already there runs up to him one who offers to present him with marble, and contribute towards the rebuilding.
Another will pre­ sent him with naked statues of Parian marble,3 another with a chef-d'œuvre of Enphranor or Polycletus.
4
Some lady will contribute some ancient ornaments of gods taken in our Asiatic victories;
another, books and cases5 and a bust of Minerva ;
another, a whole bushel of silver.
Persicus, the most splendid of childless men, replaces all he has lost by things more numerous and more valuable, and might with reason be suspected of having himself set his own house oil fire.
If you can tear yourself away from the games in the circus,2 you can buy a capital house at Sora, or Fabrateria, or Frusino, for the price at which you are now hiring your dark hole for one year.
There you will have your little garden, a well so shallow as to require no rope and bucket, whence with easy draught you may water your sprouting plants.
Live there, en­ amoured of the piteh-fork, and the dresser of your trim garden,3 from which you could supply a feast to a hundred Pythagoreans.
It is something to be able in any spot, in any retreat whatever, to have made oneself proprietor even of a single lizard.
Here full many a patient dies from want of sleep ;
but that exhaustion is produced by the undigested food that loads the fevered stomach.
For what lodging-houses allow of sleep ?
None but the very wealthy can sleep at Rome.
4
Hence is the source of the disease.
The passing of waggons in the narrow curves of the streets, and the mutual revilings of the team­ drivers5 brought to a stand still, would banish sleep even from Drusus and sea-calves.
6
If duty calls him, the rich man will be borne through the yielding crowd, and pass rapidly over their heads on the shoulders of his tall Liburnian, and, as he goes, will read or write, or even sleep inside his litter,8 for his sedan with win­ dows closed entices sleep.
And still he will arrive before us.
In front of us, as we hurry on, a tide of human beings stops the way;
the mass that follows behind presses on our loins in dense concourse;
one man pokes me with his elbow, an­ other with a hard pole ;
1 one knocks a beam against my head, „ another a ten-gallon cask.
My legs are coated thick with mud;
then, anon, I am trampled upon by great heels all round me, and the hob-nail of the soldier's caliga remains imprinted on my toe.
Do you not see with what a smoke the sportula is fre­ quented ?
A hundred guests !
and each followed by his port­ able kitchen.
2 Even Corbulo3 himself could scarcely carry such a number of huge vessels, so many things piled upon his head, which, without bending his neck, the wretched little slave supports, and keeps fanning his fire as he runs along.
4Tunics that have been patched together are torn asunder again.
Presently, as the tug approaches, the long fir-tree quivers,- other waggons are conveying pine-trees ;
they totter from their height, and threaten ruin to the crowd.
For if that wain, that is transporting blocks of Ligustican stone, is upset, and pours its mountain-load upon the masses below, what is there left of their bodies ?
Who can find their limbs or bones ?
Every single carcass of the mob is crushed to;
minute atoms as impalpable as their souls.
While, all this while, the family at home, in happy ignorance of their mas­ ter's fate, are washing up the dishes, and blowing up the fire with their mouths, and making a clatter with the well-oiled strigils, and arranging the bathing towels with the full oil­ flask.
Such are the various occupations of the bustling slaves.
But the master himself is at this moment seated5 on the banks of Styx, and, being a novice, is horrified at the grim ferry-man, and dares not hope for the boat to cross the murky stream:
nor has he, poor wretch, the obol in his mouth to hand to Charon.
Now revert to other perils of the night distinct from these.
What a height it is from the lofty roofs, from which a pot­ sherd tumbles on your brains.
How often cracked and chipped earthenware falls from the windows!
with what a weight they dint and damage the flint-pavement where they strike it!
You may well be accounted remiss and improvident against unforeseen accident, if you go out to supper without having made your will.
It is clear that there are just so many chances of death, as there are open windows where the inmates are awake inside, as you pass by.
Pray, therefore, and bear about with you this miserable wish, that they may be con­ tented with throwing down only what the broad basons have held.
One that is drunk, and quarrelsome in his cups, if he has chanced to give no one a beating, suffers the penalty by loss of sleep;
he passes such a night as Achilles bewailing the loss of his friend lies now on his face, then again on his back.
Under other circumstances, he cannot sleep.
In some persons, sleep is the result of quarrels;
but though daring from his years, and flushed with unmixed wine, he cautiously avoids him whom a scarlet cloak, and a very long train of attendants, with plenty of flambeaux and a bronzed candela­ brum, warns him to steer clear of.
As for me, whose only attendant home2 is the moon, or the glimmering light of a rush light, whose wick I husband and eke out-he utterly despises me!
Mark the prelude of this wretched fray, if fray it can be called, where he does all the beating, and I am only beaten.
3
He stands right in front of you, and bids you stand !
Obey you must.
For what can you do, when he that gives the command is mad with drink, and at the same time stronger than you.
"
Where do you come from?" he thunders out:
" With whose vinegar and beans are you blown out ?
What cobbler has been feasting on chopped leek4 or boiled sheep's head with you ?
Don't you answer ?
Speak, or be kieked !
Say where do you hang out ?
In what Jew's begging-stand shall I look for you ?"
Whether you'attempt to say a word or retire in silence, is all one ;
they beat you just the same, and then, in a passion, force you to give bail to answer for the assault.
This is a poor man's liberty !
When thrashed he humbly begs, and pummelled with fisty-cuffs supplicates, to be allowed to quit the spot with a few teeth left in his head.
Nor is this yet all that you have to fear, for there will not be wanting one to rob you, when all the houses are shut up, and all the fastenings of the shops chained, are fixed and silent.
Sometimes too a footpad does your business with his knife, whenever the Pontine marshes and the Gallinarian wood are kept safe by an armed guard.
Consequently they all flock thence to Rome as to a great preserve.
What forge or anvil is not weighed down with chains ?
The greatest amount of iron used is employed in forging fetters;
so that you may well fear that enough may not be left for ploughshares, and that mattocks and hoes may run short.
Well may you call our great grandsires 1 happy, and the ages blest in which they lived, which, under -kings and tribunes long ago, saw Rome contented with a single gaol.
2
To these I could subjoin other reasons for leaving Rome, and more numerous than these;
but my cattle summon me to be moving, and the sun is getting low.
I must go.
For long ago the muleteer gave me a hint by shaking his whip.
Fare­ well then, and forget me not!
and whenever Rome shall re­ store you to your native Aquinum, eager to refresh your strength, then.
you may tear me away too from Cumæ to Helvine Ceres,3 and your patron deity Diana.
Then, equip­ peel with my caligæ,4 I will visit your chilly regions, to help you in your satires-unless they scorn my poor assistance.
ONCE more behold Crispinus!
1 and often shall I have to call him on the stage.
A monster!
without one virtue to redeem his vices-of feeble powers, save only in his lust.
It is only a widow's charms this adulterer scorns.
What matters it then in what large porticoes he wearies out his steeds-through what vast shady groves his rides extend2—how many acres close to the forum, or what palaces he has bought ?
No bad man is ever happy.
Least of all he that has added incest to his adultery, and lately seduced the filleted priestess,3 that with her life-blood still warm must descend into the earth.
But now we have to deal with more venial acts.
Yet if any other man had committed the same, he would have come under the sentence of our imperial censor.
4
For what would be infamous in men of worth, a Titius or Seius, was becoming to Crispinus.
What can you do when no crime can be so foul and loathsome as the perpetrator himself?
He gave six sestertia for a mullet.
5
A thousand sesterces, forsooth !
for every pound of weight, as they allege, who exaggerate stories already beyond belief.
I should commend the act as a master- stroke of policy, if by so noble a present he had got himself named chief heir6 in the will of some childless old man.
A better plea still would be that he had sent it to some mistress of rank, that rides in her close chair with its wide glasses.
Nothing of the sort!
He bought it for himself!
We see many things which even Apicius7 (mean and thrifty com­ pared with him) never was guilty of.
Did you do this in days of yore, Crispinus, when girt about with your native papyrus ?1 What!
pay this price for fish-scales ?
Perchance you might have bought the fisherman cheaper than the fish !
You might have bought a whole estate for the money in some of our provinces.
In Apulia, a still larger one.
2
What kind of luxuries, then, may we suppose were gorged by the em­ peror himself, when so many sestertia, that furnished forth but a small portion, a mere side-dish of a very ordinary din­ ner, were devoured by this court buffoon, now clothed in purple.
Chief of the equestrian order now is he who was wont to hawk about the streets shads from the same borough 3 with himself.
Begin, Calliope !
here may we take our seats !
This is no poetic fiction ;
we are dealing with facts!
Relate it, Pierian maids !
and grant me grace for having called you maids.
When the last of the Flavii was mangling the world, lying at its last gasp, and Rome was enslaved by a Nero,4 ay, and a bald one too, an Adriatic turbot of wonderful size fell into the net, and filled its ample folds, off the temple of Venus which Doric Ancona5 sustains.
No less in bulk was it than those which the ice of the Mæotis encloses, and when melted at length by the sun's rays, discharges at the outlets of the sluggish Euxine, unwieldy from their long sloth, and fattened by the long-protracted cold.
This prodigy of a fish the owner of the boat and nets de­ signs for the chief pontiff.
For who would dare to put up such a fish to sale, or to buy it?
Since the shores too would be crowded with informers ;
these inspectors of sea-weed, prowl­ ing in every nook, would straightway contest the point 6 with the naked fisherman, and would not scruple to allege that the fish was a " stray," and that having made its escape from the emperor's ponds, where it had long revelled in plenty, ought of course to revert to its ancient lord.
If we place any faith in Palfurius or Armillatus, whatever is pre-eminently fine in the whole sea, is the property of the exchequer, wherever it swims.
So, that it may not be utterly lost, it will be made a present of, though now sickly autumn was giving place to winter, and sick men were already expecting1 their fits of ague, though the rude tempest whistled and kept the fish fresh, yet the fisherman hurries on as though a mild south wind were blowing.
And when the lakes were near at hand, where, though in ruins, Alba2 still preserves the Trojan fire, and her Lesser Vestal the wondering crowd for a short space impeded his entrance ;
as they made way for him, the folding­ doors flew open on ready-turning hinge.
The senators, shut out themselves, watch the dainty admitted.
He stands in the royal presence.
Then he of Picenum begins, " Deign to ac­ cept what is too great for any private kitchen :
let this day be celebrated as the festival of your genius, haste to relieve your stomach of its burden, and devour a turbot reserved to honour your reign.
4
It insisted on being caught."
What could be more fulsome ?
and yet the great man's crest rose.
What flattery is there that it is not prepared to believe, when power is praised as equal to the gods.
But there was no dish of sufficient size for the fish.
Therefore the senators are sum­ moned to a council—men whom he hated !
men on whose faces sat the paleness engendered by the wretched friendship with the great I At the loud summons of the Liburnian slave, " Run !
the emperor is already seated !” the first to snatch up his cloak and hurry to the place was Pegasus, lately set as bailiff over the amazed city ;
5 for what else were the prefects of Rome in those days ?
of whom he was the best and most con- scientious dispenser of the laws, though in those days of terror he thought all things ought to be administered by justice un­ armed.
Crispus1 came too, that facetious old man, with high character equal to his eloquence and mild disposition.
Who could have been a more serviceable minister to one that ruled seas, and lands, and peoples, if, under that bane and pest of mankind, he had been allowed to reprobate his savage nature and give honest advice ?
But what is more ticklish than a tyrant's ear, with whom the life even of a favourite was at stake, though he might be talking of showers or heat, or a rainy spring ?
He, therefore, never attempted to swim against the stream, nor was he a citizen who dared give vent to the free sentiments of his soul, and devote his life to the cause of truth:
and so it was that he saw many winters and eighty summers;
safe, by such weapons, even in a court like that.
Next to him hurried Acilius, a man of the same time of life ;
with a youth2 that ill deserved so cruel a death as that which awaited him, so prematurely inflicted by the tyrant's swords ;
but nobility coupled with old age, has long since been a miracle.
Consequently, for myself, I should prefer being a younger brother of the giants.
3
It was of no avail therefore to the wretched man, that as a naked huntsman in the amphi­ theatre of Alba, he fought hand to hand with Numidian bears.
For who, in our days, is not up to the artifices of the patricians ?
Who would now admire that primitive cunning of thine, Brutus ?
It is an easy thing to impose on a king that wears a beard!
4
Then came Rubrius not a whit less pale, though he was no noble, one accused of an ancient and name­ less crime, and yet more lost to shame than the pathic satir­ ist.
5
There too is to be seen Montanus' paunch, unwieldy from its size, and Crispus reeking with unguent though so early in the day, more than enough to furnish forth two funerals;
and Pompeius, still more ruthless even than he at cutting men's throats by his insinuating whisper;
and he that kept his entrails only to fatten the Dacian vultures, Fuscus, that studied the art of war in his marble palace ;
and the shrewd Veiento with the deadly Catullus,l who raged with lust for a girl he could not see, a monster and prodigy of guilt even in our days, the blind flatterer, a common bridge-beggar2 invested with this hateful power, whose worthiest fate would be to run begging by the carriages on the road to Aricia, and blow his fawning kisses to the chariot as it descends the hill.
No one showed more'astonishment at the turbot, for he was profuse in his wonder, turning towards the left, but unfortunately the fish lay on the other side.
This was just the way he used to praise the combat and fencing of the Cilician gladiator, and the stage machinery, and the boys caught up by it to the awning.
Veiento is not to be outdone by him;
but, like one inspired by the maddening influence of Bellona, begins to di­ vine.
"A mighty omen this yon have received of some great and noble triumph.
Some captive king you'll take, or Arvi­ ragus will be hurled from his British car.
For the monster is a foreign one.
Do you see the sharp fins bristling on his back like spears?"
In one point only Fabricius was at fault, he could not tell the turbot's country or age.
“
What then is your opinion ?
Is it to be cut up?"
"Heaven forefend so great dishonour to the noble fish !” says Montanus. "
Let a deep dish be provided, whose thin sides may enclose its huge circumference.
Some cunning Prometheus to act on this sudden emergency is required.
Quick with the clay and potter's wheel !
But henceforth, Cæsar, let potters always at­ tend your armies !"
This opinion, worthy of the author, car­ ried the day.
He was well versed in the old luxury of the imperial court, and Nero's nights,3 and a second appetite when the stomach was fired with the Falernian.
4
No one in my day was a greater connoisseur in good eating;
he could detect at the first bite whether the oysters were natives from Circeii, or the Lucrine rocks, or whether they came from the Rutu­ pian beds, and told the shore an Echinus came from at the first glance.
They rise ;
and the cabinet being dismissed, the great chief bids the nobles depart whom he had dragged to the Alban height, amazed and forced to hurry, as though he were about to announce some tidings of the Catti and fierce Sicambri;
as though from diverse parts of the world some alarming express had arrived on hurried wing.
And would that he had de­ voted to such trifles as these those days of horror and cruelty, in which he removed from the city those glorious and illus­ trious spirits, with none to punish or avenge the deed !
But he perished as soon as he began to be an object of alarm to cobblers.
This was what proved fatal to one that was reek­ ing with the blood of the Lamise!
IF you are not yet ashamed of your course of life,1 and your feeling is still the same, that you consider living at another man's table to be the chief gbod ;
if you can put up with such things as not even Sarmentus1 or Galba, contemptible as he was, would have submitted to even at the unequal2 board of Cæsar himself;
I should be afraid to believe your evidence though you were on oath.
I know nothing more easily satisfied than the cravings of nature.
Yet even suppose this little that is needed to be wanting, is there no quay vacant ?
is there no where a bridge, and a piece of mat, somewhat less than half, to be- upon ?
Is the loss of a supper so great a matter?
is your craving so fierce?
when, in faith, it were much more reputable3 to shiver there, and munch mouldy fragments of dog-biscuit.
In the first place, bear in mind, that when invited to dinner, you receive payment in full of your long-standing account of service.
The sole result of your friendship with the great man is-a meal!
This your patron sets down to your account, and, rare though it be, still takes it into the calculation.
Therefore, if after the lapse of two months he deigns to send for his long-neglected client, only that the third place may not be unoccupied in one couch of his triclinium1—“
Let us sup together," he says ;
the very summit of your wishes !
What more can you desire ?
Trebius has that for which he ought to break his rest, and hurry away with latchet all untied, in his alarm lest the whole crowd at his patron's levee shall have already gone their round of compliments, when the stars are fading, or at the hour when the chill wain of sluggish Bootes wheels slowly round.
2
But what sort of a supper is it after all ?
Wine, such as wool just shorn would not imbibe.
3
You will see the guests become frantic as the priests of Cybele.
Wranglings are the prelude of the fray:
but soon you begin to hurl cups as well in retaliation;
and wipe your wounds with your napkin stained with blood;
as often as a pitched battle, begun with pitchers of Saguntine ware, rages between you and the regiment of freedmen.
The great man himself drinks wine racked from the wood under some consul with long hair,4 and sips5 the juice of the grape pressed in the Social war;
never likely, however, to send even a small glass to a friend, though sick at heart.
To-morrow, he will drink the produce of the mountains of Alba or Setia,6 whose country and date age has obliterated by the accumulated mould on the ancient amphora ;
such wine as, with chaplets on their heads, Thrasea and Helvi­ dius used to drink on the birth-days of the Bruti and Cassius.
Virro himself holds capacious cups formed of hetears of the Heliades 1 and phialæ incrusted with beryl
You are not trusted with gold:
or even if it is ever handed to you, a servant is set as a guard over you at the same time, to count the gems and watch your sharp nails.
Forgive the precau­ tion :
the jasper so much admired there is indeed a noble one :
for, like many others, Virro transfers to his cups the gems from off his fingers, which the youth, preferred to the jealous Hiarbas,2 used to set on the front of his scabbard.
You will drain a cup with four noses, that bears the name of the cobbler of Beneventum,3 already cracked, and fit to be ex­ changed, as broken glass, for brimstone.
4
If your patron's stomach is overheated with wine and food, he calls for water cooled by being boiled and then iced in Scythian snow.
5
Did I complain just now that the wine set before you was not the same as Virro's ?
Why, the very water you drink is different.
Your cups will be handed you by a running footman from Gætulia, or the bony hand of some Moor, so black that you would rather not meet him at midnight, while riding through the tombs on the steep Latin way.
Before Virro himself stands the flower of Asia, pur­ chased at a greater sum than formed the whole revenue of the warlike Tullus, or Ancus—and, not to detain you.
the whole fortunes6 of all the kings of Rome.
And so, when you are thirsty, look behind you for your black Ganymede that comes from Africa.
A boy that costs so many thousands deigns not to mix wine for the poor.
Nay, his very beauty and bloom of youth justify his sneer.
When does he come near you ?
When would he come, even if you called him, to serve you with hot or cold water ?
He scorns, forsooth, the idea of obeying an old client, and that you should call for any thing from his hand;
and that you should recline at table, while he has to stand.
Every great house is proportionably full of saucy menials.
See, too, with what grumbling another of these rascals hands you bread that can scarce be broken ;
the mouldy frag­ ments of impenetrable crust, which would make your jaws ache, and give you no chance of a Dite.
But delicate bread, as white as snow, made of the finest flower, is reserved for the great man.
Mind you keep your hands off!
Maintain the respect due to the cutter of the bread !1 Imagine, however, that you have been rather too forward ;
there stands over you one ready to make you put it down., . " Be so good, audacious guest, as to help yourself from the bread-basket you have been used to, and know the colour of your own particular bread." " So then !2 it was for this, forsooth, that I so often quitted my wife, and hurried up the steep ascent of the bleak Esqui­ line, when the vernal sky rattled with the pelting of the piti­ less hail, and my great coat dripped whole showers of rain !
"See ! with how vast a body the lobster which is served to your patron fills the dish, and with what fine asparagus it is garnished all round ;
with what a tail he seems to look down in scorn on the assembled guests, when he comes in raised on high by the hands of the tall slave.
But to you is served a common crab, scantily hedged in 3 with half an egg sliced, a meal fit only for the dead,4 and in a dish too small to hold it.
Virro himself drowns his fish in oil from, Venafrum;
but the pale cabbage set before you, poor wretch, will stink of the lamp.
For in the sauce-boats you are allowed, there is served oil such as the canoe of the Micipsæ has im­ ported in its sharp prow;
for which reason no one at Rome would bathe in the same bath with Bocchor ;
which makes the blackamoors safe even from the attacks of serpents.
Your patron will have a barbel furnished by Corsica, or the rocks of Tauromenium, when all our own waters have been ransacked and failed;
while gluttony is raging, and the market is plying its unwearied nets in the neighbouring seas, and we do not allow the Tyrrhene fish to reach their full growth.
The provinces, therefore, have to supply our kitchen ;
and thence we are furnished with what Lenas the legacy- hunter may buy, and Aurelia sell again.
1 Virro is presented with a lamprey of the largest size from the Sicilian whirlpool.
For while Auster keeps himself close, while he seats himself and dries his wet pinions in prison, the nets,2 grown venture­ some, despise the dangers even of the middle of Charybdis.
An eel awaits you—first-cousin to the long snake-or a coarse pike3 from the Tiber, spotted from the winter's ice, a native of the bank-side, fattened on the filth of the rushing sewer, and used to penetrate the drain even of the middle of Su­ burra. \"
I should like to have a word with Virro, if he would lend an attentive ear.
No one now expects from you such pre­ sents as used to be sent by Seneca to his friends of humble station, or the munificent gifts which the bountiful Piso or Cotta used to dispense ;
for in days of old the glory of giving was esteemed a higher honour than fasces or inscriptions.
All we ask is that you would treat us at supper like fellow- citizens.
Do this, and then, if you please, be, as many now- a-days are, luxurious when alone, parsimonious to your guests.
"
Before Virro himself is the liver of a huge goose;
a fat capon, as big as a goose ;
and a wild boar, worthy of the spear of the yellow-haired Meleager, smokes.
Then will be served up truffles, if it happen to be spring, and the thunder, devoutly wished for by the epicure, shall augment the supper.
"
Keep your corn, 0 Libya," says Alledius, " unyoke your oxen ;
pro­ vided only you send us truffles !"
Meanwhile, that no single source of vexation may be wanting, you will see the carver4 capering and gesticulating with nimble knife, till he has gone through all the directions of his instructor in the art.
Nor is it in truth a matter of trifling import with what an air a leveret or a hen is carved.
You would be dragged by the heels, like Cacus' when conquered by Hercules, and turned out of doors, if you were ever to attempt to open your mouth, as though you had three names.
2
When does Virro pass the cup to you, or take one that your lips have contaminated ?
Which of you would be so rash, so lost to all sense of shame, as to say, " Drink, sir !” to your patron lord ?
There are very many things which men with coats worn threadbare dare not say.
If any god, or god-like hero, kinder to you than the fates have been, were to give you a knight's estate, what a great man would you, small mortal, become all at once from nothing at all!
What a dear friend of Virro's ! “
Give this to Trebius !3
Set this before Trebius !
My dear brother, will you take some of this sweet-bread ?"0 money!
it 'is to thee he pays this honour !
it is thou and he are the brothers !
But if you wish to be my lord, and my lord's lord, let no little Æneas sport in your hall,4 or a daughter more endearing than he.
It is the barrenness of the wife that makes a friend really agreeable and beloved.
But even suppose your Mycale should be confined, though she should even present you three boys at a birth, lie will be the very one to be delighted with the twittering nest;
will order his green stomacher 5 to be brought, and the filberts,6 and the begged-for penny, whenever the infant parasite shall come to dine with him.
Before his friends whom he holds so vile will be set some very questionable toadstools—before the great man himself, a mushroom7—but such an one as Claudius eat, before that furnished by his wife, after which he eat nothing more.
Virro will order to be served to himself and his brother Virros such noble apples, on whose fragrance alone you are allowed to revel ;
such as the eternal autumn of the Phæacians pro­ duced ;
or such as you might fancy purloined from the Afri­ can sisters.
You feast upon some shrivelled windfall, such as is munched at the ramparts by him that is armed with buck­ ler and helmet:
and, in dread of the lash, learns to hurl his javelin from the shaggy goat’s1 back.
You may imagine, perhaps, that Virro does all this from stinginess.
No! his very object is to vex you.
For what play, what mime is better than disappointed gluttony ?
All this, therefore, is done, if you don't know it, that you may be forced to give vent to your bile by your tears, and gnash long, your compressed teeth.
You fancy yourself a freeman-the great man's welcome guest!
He looks upon you as one caught by the savour of his kitchen:
Nor does he conjecture amiss.
For who is so utterly destitute as twice to bear with his in­ solence, if it has been his good fortune, when a boy, to wear the Tuscan gold,2 or even the boss, the badge of leather, that emblem of poverty.
The hope of a good dinner deludes you.
“ See !
sure he '11 send us now a half-eaten hare, or a slice of that wild-boar haunch.
3
Now we shall get that capon, as he has helped him­ self!"
Consequently you all sit in silent expectation, with bread in hand, untouched and ready for action.
And he that uses you thus, shows his wisdom-if you can submit to all these things, then you ought to bear them.
Some day or other, you will present your head with shaven crown, to be beaten :
nor hesitate to submit to the harsh lash-well wor­ thy of such a banquet and such a friend as this !
I BELIEVE that while Saturn still was king, chastity lingered upon earth, and was long seen there:
when a chill cavern furnished a scanty dwelling, and enclosed in one common shade the fire and household gods, the cattle, and their owners.
When a wife, bred on the mountains, prepared a rustic bed with leaves and straw and the skins of the wild beasts their neighbours;
not like thee, Cynthia,1—or thee whose beaming eyes the death of a sparrow dimmed with tears,-but bearing breasts from which her huge infants might drink, not suck, and often more uncivilized even than her acorn-belching husband.
Since men lived very differently then, when the world was new, and the sky but freshly created, who, born from the riven oak, or moulded out of clay, had no parents.
Many traces of primæval chastity, perhaps, or some few at least, may have existed, even under Jove ;
but then it was be­ fore Jove's beard was grown;
before the Greeks were yet ready to swear by another's head ;
when no one feared a thief for his cabbages or apples, but lived with garden unenclosed.
Then by degrees Astræa retired to the realms above, with chastity for her companion, and the two sisters fled together.
To violate the marriage-bed, and laugh to scorn the genius that presides over the nuptial couch, is an ancient and a hack­ neyed vice, Postumus.
Every other species of iniquity the age of iron soon produced.
The silver age witnessed the first adulterers.
And yet are you preparing your marriage covenant, and the settlement,2 and betrothal, in our days, and are already under the hands of the master barber, and perhaps have al­ ready given the pledge for her finger !
Well!
you used to be sane, at all events !
You, Postumus, going to marry !
Say, what Tisiphone, what snakes are driving you mad ?
Can you submit to be the slave of any woman, while so many halters are to be had ?
so long as high and dizzy windows are open for you, and the Æmilian bridge presents itself so near at hand ?
Or if, out of so many ways of quitting life, none pleases you, do you not think your present plan better, of having a stripling to sleep with you, who lying there, reads you no curtain lectures, exacts no little presents from you, and never complains that you are too sparing in your efforts to please him ?
But Ursidius is delighted with the Julian law,1—he thinks of bringing up a darling heir, nor cares to lose the fine turtle­ dove and bearded mullets,2 and all the baits for legacies in the dainties of the market.
What will you believe to be im­ possible, if Ursidius takes a wife ?
If he, of yore the most notorious of adulterers, whom the chest of Latinus in peril of his life has so often concealed, is now going to insert his idiot head in the nuptial halter ;
nay, and more than this, is looking out for a wife possessed of the virtues of ancient days !
Haste, physicians, bore through the middle vein !
What a nice man !
Fall prostrate at the threshold of Tarpeian Jove, and sacri­ fice to Juno a heifer with gilded horns, if you have the rare good fortune to find a matron with unsullied chastity.
So few are there worthy to handle the fillets of Ceres ;

In all the public walks can a woman be pointed out to you, that is worthy of your wish.
On all their benches do the public shows hold one that you could love without mis­ givings ;
or one you could pick out from the rest ?
While the effeminate Bathyllus is acting Leda in the ballet, Tuccia cannot contain herself, Appula whines as in the feat of love, ihymele is all attention to the quick, the gener, ana the slow ;
and so Thymele, rustic as she was before, becomes a pro­ ficient in the art.
But others, whenever the stage ornaments, packed away, get a respite, and the courts alone are vocal, (since the theatres are closed and empty, and the Megalesian games come a long time after the plebeian,) in their melancholy handle the mask and thyrsus and drawers of Accius.
Urbicus provokes a laugh by his personification of Autonoe in the Atellan farce.
Ælia, being poor, is in love with him.
For others, the fibula of the comic actor is unbuckled for a large sum.
Some women prevent Chrysogonus from having voice to sing.

Do you expect then that the worthy Quintilianus will be the object of their love ?
You take a wife by whom Echion the harper, or Gla­ phyrus, or Ambrosius the choral flute-player, will become a father.
Let us erect long lines of scaffolding along the narrow streets.
Let the door-posts and the gate be decorated with a huge bay, that beneath the canopy inlaid with tortoiseshell,1 thy infant, Lentulus, supposed to be sprung from a noble sire, may be the counterpart of the Mirmillo Euryalus.
Hippia, though wife to a senator, accompanied a gladiator to Pharos and the Nile, and the infamous walls of Lagos.
2 Even Canopus itself reprobated the immorality of the imperial city.
She, forgetful of her home, her husband, and her sister, showed no concern for her native land, or, vile wretch as she was, her weeping children, and, to amaze you even more, quitted the shows and Paris.
But though when a babe she had been pil­ lowed in great luxury, in the down of her father's mansion, and a cradle of richest workmanship, she despised the perils of the sea.
Her good name she had long before despised­ the loss of which, among the soft cushions of ladies, is very cheaply held.
Thereford with undaunted breast she faced the Tuscan waves and wide-resounding Ionian Sea, though the sea was so often to be changed.
If the cause of the peril be reasonable and creditable, then they are alarmed-their coward hearts are chilled with icy fear-they cannot support themselves on their trembling feet.
They show a dauntless spirit in those things which they basely dare.
If it is their husband that bids them, it is a great hardship to go on board ship.
Then the bilgewater is insufferable !
the skies spin round them !
She that follows her adulterer, has no qualms.
The one is sick all over her husband.
The other dines among the sailors and walks the quarter-deck, and delights in hand­ ling the hard ropes.
And yet what was the beauty that in­ flamed, what the prime of life that captivated Hippia ?
What was it she saw in him to compensate her for being nicknamed the fencer's whore ?
For the darling Sergius had now begun to shave his throat;
and badly wounded in the arm to anti­ cipate his discharge.
Besides, he had many things to dis­ figure his face, as for instance-he was galled with his helmet, and had a huge wen between his nostrils, and acrid rheum for ever trickling from his eye.
But then he was a gladiator !
It is this that makes them beautiful as Hyacinthus !
It was this she preferred to her children and her native land, her sister and her husband.
It is the steel they are enamoured of.
This very same Sergius, if discharged from the arena, would begin to be Veiento in her eyes.
Do you feel an interest in a private house, in a Hippia's acts ?
Turn your eyes to the rivals of the gods !
Hear what Claudius had to endure.
As soon as his wife perceived he was asleep, this imperial harlot, that dared prefer a coarse mattress to the royal bed, took her hood she wore by nights, quitted the palace with but a single attendant, but with a yellow tire concealing her black hair ;
entered the brothel warm with the old patch-work quilt, and the cell vacant and appropriated to herself.
Then took her stand with naked breasts and gilded nipples, assumi the name of Lycisca, and displayed the person of the mother of the princely Britannicus, received all comers with caresses and asked her compliment, and submitted to often-repeated embraces.
Then when the owner dismissed his denizens, sadly she took her leave, and (all she could do) lingered to the last before she closed her cell;
and still raging with unsatisfied desire, tired with the toil but yet unsated, she retired with sullied cheeks defiled, and, foul from the smoke of lamps, bore back the odour of the stews to the pillow of the emperor.
Shall I speak of the love-philters, the incantations, the poison mingled with the food and given to the step-son ?
The acts which they commit, to which they are impelled by the imperative suggestions of their sex, are still more atrocious:
those they commit through lust are the least of their crimes. “
Then, how can it be that even by her husband's showing Cesennia is the best of wives ? "
She brought him a thousand sestertia !
that is the price at which he calls her chaste.
It is not with Venus' quiver that he grows thin, or with her torch he burns;
it is from that his fires are fed ;
from her dowry that the arrows emanate.
She has purchased her liberty:
therefore, even in her husband's presence, she may exchange signals, and answer her love-letters.
A rich wife, with a covetous husband, has all a widow's privileges. " Why then does Sertorius burn with passion for Bibula?"
If you sift the truth, it is not the wife he is in love with, but the face.
Let a wrinkle or two make their appearance, and the shrivelled skin grow flaccid, her teeth get black, or her eyes smaller­ "
Pack up your baggage," the freedman will say, " and march.
You are become offensive.
You blow your nose too frequently.
March !
and be quick about it!
Another is coming whose nose is not so moist."
Meanwhile she is hot and imperious, and demands of her husband shepherds and sheep from Ca­ nusium, and elms2 from Falernum.
What a trifle is this?
Then every boy she fancies, whole droves of slaves,'and what­ ever she has not in her house, and her neighbour has, must be bought.
Nay, in the mid-winter month, when now the merchant Jason is shut up, and the cottage3 white with hoar frost de­ tains the sailors all equipped for their voyage, she takes huge crystalline vases,4 and then again myrrhine of immense size:
then an adamant whose history is well known, and whose value is enhanced by having been on Berenice's finger.
This in days of yore a barbarian king gave his incestuous love- Agrippa to his own sister!
where bare-foot kings observe festal sabbaths, and a long-established clemency grants long life to pigs.“
Is there not one, then, out of such large herds of women, that seems to you a worthy match ?"
Let her be beautiful, graceful, rich, fruitful;
marshal along her porticoes her rows of ancestral statues;
let her be more chaste than any single Sabine that, with hair dishevelled, brought the war to a close ;
be a very phoenix upon earth, rare as a black swan ;
who could tolerate a wife in whom all excellencies are concen­ trated !
I would rather, far rather, have a country maiden from Venusia, than you, O Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, if along with your exalted virtues you bring as portion of your dower a haughty and disdainful brow, and reckon as part of your fortune the triumphs of your house !
Away, I be,, with your Hannibal and Syphax conquered in his camp, and tramp with all your Carthage !“
Spare, I pray thee, Pæan !
and thou, 0 goddess, lay down thine arrows!
The children are innocent.
Transfix the mother herself!"
So prays Amphion.
Yet Pæan bends his bow.
Therefore she had to bury her herds of children, to­ gether with their sire, while Niobe seems to herself to be more noble than Latona's race, and moreover more fruitful even than the white sow.
What dignity of deportment, what beauty, can compensate for your wife's always throwing her own worth in your teeth ?
For all the satisfaction of this rare and chief good is destroyed, if, entirely spoilt by haughti­ ness of soul, it entails more bitter than sweet.
But who is so devotedly uxorious, as not to feel a dread of her whom he praises to the skies, and hate her seven hours out of every twelve ?
There are some things, trifling indeed, and yet such as no husband can tolerate.
For what can be more sickening than the fact that no one woman considers herself beautiful, unless instead of Tuscan she has become a little Greek-meta­ morphosed from a maid of Sulmo to a "maid of Athens."
Every thing is in Greek.
(While surely it is more disgrace­ ful for our countrywomen not to know their mother tongue.)
In this language they give vent to their fears, their anger, their joys and cares, and all the inmost workings of their soul.
Nay more, they kiss a la Grecque !
This in young girls you may excuse.
But must thou, forsooth, speak Greek, that hast had the wear and tear of six and eighty years ?
In an old woman this language becomes immodest, when interspersed with the wanton Ζωὴ καὶ ψυχή.
You are employing in pub­ lie, expressions one might think you had just used under the counterpane.
For whose passion would not be excited by these enticing and wanton words ?
It has all the force of actual touching.
Yet though you pronounce them all in more insinuating tones than even Hæmus or Carpophorus, your face, the tell-tale of your years, makes all the feathers droop.
If you are not likely to love her that is contracted and united to you in lawful wedlock, there seems no single reason why you should marry, nor why you should waste the wed­ ding dinner and bride cakes1 which you must dispense, when their complimentary attendance is over, to your bridal guests already well crammed;
nor the present given for the first nuptial night, when, in the well-stored dish, Dacicus2 and Germanicus glitters with its golden legend.
If you are pos­ sessed of such simplicity of character as to be enamoured of your wife, and your whole soul is devoted to her alone, then bow your head with neck prepared to bear the yoke.
You will find none that will spare a man that loves her.
Though she be enamoured herself, she delights in tormenting and fleecing her lover.
Consequently a wife is far more dis­ astrous to him that is likely to prove a kind and eligible husband.
You will never be allowed to make a present without your wife's consent.
If she opposes it, you must not sell a single thing, or buy one, against her will.
She will give away your affections.
That good old friend of many long years will be shut out from that gate that saw his first sprouting beard.
1
While pimps and trainers have free liberty to make their own wills, and even gladiators enjoy the same amount of privilege, you will have your will dictated to you, and find more than one rival named as your heirs.“
Crucify that slave." " What is the charge, to call for such a punishment ?
What witness can you produce ?
Who gave the information ?
Listen !
Where man's life is at stake no deliberation can be too long." " Idiot!
so a slave is a man then !
Granted he has done nothing.
I will it, I insist on it!
Let my will stand instead of reason !
”Therefore she lords it over her husband:
- but soon she quits these realms, and seeks new empires and wears out her bridal veil.
Then she flies back, and seeks again the traces of the bed she scorned.
2
She leaves the doors so recently adorned, the tapestry still hanging on the house, and the branches still green upon the threshold.
Thus the number grows :
thus she has her eight3 husbands in five years.
A notable fact to record upon her tomb !
,All chance of domestic happiness is hopeless while your wife's mother is alive.
She bids her exult in despoiling her husband to the utmost.
She teaches her how to write back nothing savouring of discourtesy or inexperience to the mis­ sives of the seducer.
She either baulks or bribes your spies ;
then, though your daughter is in rude health, calls in Archi­ genes, and tosses off the bed-clothes as too oppressive.
Mean­ while the adulterer, concealed apart, stands trembling with impatient expectation.
Do you expect, forsooth, that the mother will inculcate virtuous principles, or other than she cherishes herself ?
It is right profitable too for a depraved old hag to train her daughter to the same depravity.
There is scarcely a single cause in which a woman is not engaged in some way in fomenting the suit.
If Manilia is not defendant, she will be plaintiff.
They draw up and frame bills of indictment unassisted,' quite prepared to dictate even to Celsus2 the exordium and topics he should use.
The Tyrian Endromides3 and the Ceroma for women who is ignorant of?
Or who has not seen the wounds of the Plastron,4 which she dints with unwearied foil, and attacks with her shield, and goes with precision through her ex­ ercise ?
A matron most pre-eminently worthy of the trumpet of the Floralia.
Unless indeed in that breast of hers she is plotting something deeper, and training in real earnest for the amphitheatre.
3
What modesty can a woman show that wears a helmet, and eschews her sex, and delights in feats of strength ?
And yet, in spite of all, this virago would not wish to become a man.
For how small is our pleasure compared to theirs !
Yet what a goodly array would there be, if there were an auction of your wife's goods :
belt and gauntlets6 and crest, and the half-armour for the left leg!
Or if she shall engage in a different way of fighting,7 you will be lucky in­ deed when your young wife sells her greaves.
Yet these very same women perspire even in their muslin ;
whose deli­ cate frames even a slip of sarcenet oppresses.
See !
with what a noise she makes the home-thrusts taught her by the trainer, and what a weight of helmet bows her down, how firmly she plants herself on her haunches, in what a thick mass is the roll of clothes.
Then smile when, laying aside her arms, she takes her oblong vessel.
Tell me, ye granddaughters of Le­ pidus or blind Metellus, or Fabius Gurges, what actress ever wore a dress like this ?
When would Asylus' wife cry Hah !
at the Plastron ?
The bed in which a wife lies is the constant scene of quar­ rels and mutual recriminations.
There is little chance of sleep there.
Then is she indeed bitter towards her husband, fiercer than tigress robbed of her whelps ;
when, conscious of her secret guilt, she counterfeits groans, or hates the servants, or upbraids you with some rival of her own creation, with tears ever fruitful, ever ready at their post, and only waiting her command in what way to flow.
You believe it genuine love.
You, poor hedge-sparrow, plume yourself, and kiss off the tears !
Ah !
what amorous lays, what letters would you read, if you were but to examine the writing-case of that adulteress that counterfeits jealousy so well!
But suppose her actually caught in the arms of a slave or knight.
" Pray suggest in this case some colour able excuse, Quintilian!” " We are at fault!
Let the lady herself speak !" "
It was formerly agreed," she says, “ that you should do what you pleased, and that I also might have full power to gratify myself.
In spite of your outcry and confounding heaven and sea, I am mortal."
Nothing is more audacious than these women when detected.
They affect resentment, and borrow courage from their very guilt itself.
Yet should you ask whence are these unnatural prodigies, or from what source they spring;
it was their humble for­ tune that made the Latin women chaste in days of yore, nor did hard toil and short nights’ rest, and hands galled and hard­ ened 1 with the Tuscan fleece, and Hannibal close to the city, and their husbands mounting guard at the Colline tower, suffer their lowly roofs to be contaminated by vice.
Now we are suffering all the evils of long-continued peace.
Luxury, more ruthless than war, broods over Rome, and exacts vengeance for a conquered world.
No guilt or deed of lust is wanting, since Roman poverty has disappeared.
This was the source whence Sybaris flowed to these seven hills, and Rhodes too, and Miletus, and Tarentum crowned with gar­ lands, insolent and flushed with wine !
Money, the nurse of debauchery, was the first that intro­ duced foreign manners, and enervating riches sapped the si­ news of the age with foul luxury.
For what cares Venus in her cups ?
All difference of head or tail is alike to her who at very midnight devours huge oysters, when unguents mixed with neat Falernian foam, when she drains the conch, 1 when from her dizziness the roof seems to reel, and the table to rise up with the lights doubled in number.
2
Go then, and know­ ing all this, doubt, if you can, with what a snort of scorn Tul­ lia snuffs up the air, when she passes the ancient altar of Chastity ;
or what Collatia says to her accomplice Maura.
Here they set down their litters at night, and bedew the very image of the goddess with copious irrigations, while the chaste moon witnesses their abominations,3 over which, when morn returns, you pass on your way to visit your great friends.
The secrets of Bona Dea are well known.
When the pipe excites them, and inflamed alike with the horn and wine, these Mænads of Priapus rush wildly round, and whirl their locks and howl!
Then, as their passions rise, how burning is their lust, how frantic their words, when all power of re­ straining their desires is lost!
A prize is proposed, and Saufeia4 challenges the vilest of her sex, and bears off the prize.
In these games nothing is counterfeit, all is acted to the life;
so that even the aged Priam, effete from years, or Nestor himself, might be inflamed at the sight.
Then their lust admits of no delay.
Then the woman appears in all her native depravity;
and by all alike is the shout re-echoed from the whole den—"
Now is the proper time.
Let in the men !"
But the adulterer still sleeps ;
so she bids the youth put on a female hood, and speed to the spot.
If none can be found, they have recourse to slaves.
If there is no hope of slaves, they will hire some water-carrier to come.
If this fails too, and no men can be found, she would not hesitate to descend still lower in the scale of creation.
Oh, would that our ancient rites and public worship could at least be celebrated, uncontaminated by such pollutions as these !
But even the Moors and Indians know what singing wench produced his wares equal in bulk to Cesar's two Anticatos, in a place whence even a mouse, conscious of his sex, would flee, and every picture is veiled over that represents the other sex.
Yet, even in those days, what man despised the deity ?
or who had dared to ridicule Numa's earthen bowl and black dish, and the brittle vessels from Mount Vatican.
But now what altars are there that a Clodius does not assail ?
I hear the advice that my good friends of ancient days would give-"
Put on a lock !
keep her in confinement!"
But who is to guard the guards themselves?
Your wife is as cunning as you, and begins with them.
And, in our days, the highest and the lowest are fired with the same lust.
Nor is she that wears out the black pavement with her feet, better than she who is borne on the shoulders of her tall Syrian slaves.
Ogulnia, in order that she may go in due state to the games, hires a dress, and attendants, and a sedan, and pillow, and female friends, and a nurse, and yellow-haired girl1 to whom she may issue her commands.
Yet all that remains of her family plate, and even the very last remnants of it,2 she gives to well-oiled Athletes.
Many women are in straitened circum­ stances at home ;
yet none of them has the modest self­ restraint that should accompany poverty, or limits herself within that measure which her poverty has allotted and as­ signed to her.
Yet men do sometimes look forward to what may be to their interest hereafter, and, with the ant for their instructress, some have at last felt a dread of cold and hunger.
Yet woman, in her prodigality, perceives not that her fortune is fast coming to nought;
and as though money, with vege­ tative power, would bloom afresh 1 from the drained chest, and the heap from which she takes would be ever full, she never reflects how great a sum her pleasures cost her.
Some women ever take delight in unwarlike eunuchs, and soft kisses, and the loss of all hope of beard, that precludes the necessity of abortives.
Yet the summit of their pleasure is when this operation has been performed in the heat and prime of man­ hood, and the only loss sustained is that the surgeon Helio­ dorus cheats the barber of his fees.
Such is his mistress' will:
and, conspicuous from afar, and attracting the eyes of all, he enters the baths, and vies even with the god that guards our vines and gardens.
Let him sleep with his mis­ tress !
But, Postumus, suffer not the youthful Bromius to enter the lists with him.
If she takes delight in singing, the fibula of none of these fellows that sells his voice to the prætor holds out:
the instruments are for ever in her hands;
the whole lyre sparkles with the jewels thickly set.
She runs over the strings with the vibrating quill,2 with which the soft Hedy­ meles performed:
this she holds in her hands;
with this she consoles herself, and lavishes kisses on the plectrum, dear for its owner's sake.
One of the clan of the Lamite,3 a lady of lofty rank, inquired with meal-cake and wine of Janus and Vesta, whether Pollio might venture to hope for the oaken crown at the Capitoline games,4 and promise it to his lyre.
What more could she do were her husband sick ?
What, if the physicians had despaired of her infant son ?
She stood before the altar, and thought no shame to veil her head for a harper:
and went through in due form the words prescribed, 1 and grew pale as the lamb was opened.
Tell me now, I pray, tell me, thou ancientest of gods, father Janus!
dost thou return answer to these ?
Great must be indeed the leisure 2 of heaven !
There can be no business there, as far as I see, stirring amongst you.
One womau consults you about comic actors ;
another would fain commend a tragedian to your notice:
the soothsayer will become varicose.
3But let her rather be musical than By through the whole city, with bold bearing ;
and encounter the assemblies of men, and in her husband's presence herself converse with generals in their scarlet cloaks,4 with unabashed gaze and breasts exposed.
She too knows all that is going on in the whole world-what the Seres or Thracians are engaged in­ the secrets of the step-mother and her son—what adulterer is in love, or is in great request.
She will tell you who made the widow pregnant-in what month it was — in what lan­ guage and manner each act of love takes place.
She is the first6 to see the comet that menaces the Armenian and Par­ thian king;
and she intercepts 7 at the gates the reports and freshest news.
Some she invents as well.
That Niphates8 has overwhelmed whole nations, and that the whole country is there laid under water by a great deluge;
that cities are tottering, the earth sinking down-this she tells in every place of resort to every one she meets.
And yet that vice is not more intolerable, than that, though earnestly entreated,' she will seize upon her poor neighbours, and have them cut in two with lashes.
For if her sound slumbers are disturbed by the barking of a dog, "Bring the clubs 2 here at once !" she cries :
and orders the owner first to be beaten with them, and then the dog.
Terrible to encounter, most awful in visage, she enters the baths by night-by night she orders her bathing vessels and camp to be set in motion.
She delights in perspiring with great tumult;
when her arms have sunk down wearied with the heavy dumb-bells ;
and the sly anointer has omitted to rub down no part of her body.
Her poor wretches of guests meanwhile are overcome with drowsiness and hunger.
At last the lady comes ;
flushed, and thirsty enough for a whole flagon,3 which is placed at her feet and filled from a huge pitcher:
of which a second pint is drained before she tastes food, to make her appetite quite ravenous.
Then having rinsed out her stomach, the wine re­ turns in a cascade on the floor-rivers gush over the marble pavement,5 or the broad vessel reeks of Falernian-for thus, just as when a long snake has glided into a deep cask, she drinks and vomits.
Therefore her husband turns sick ;
and with eyes closed smothers his rising bile.
And yet that woman is more offensive still, who, as soon as she has taken her place at table, praises Virgil, and excuses the suicide of Dido:
matches and compares poets together :
in one scale weighs Maro in the balance, and Homer in the other.
The grammarians yield;
rhetoricians are confuted;
the whole company is silenced;
neither lawyer nor crier 1 can put in a word, nor even another woman.
Such a torrent of words pours forth, you would say so many basons or bells were all being struck at once.
Henceforth let no one trouble trumpets or brazen vessels;
she will be able singly to relieve the moon when suffering 2 an eclipse.
The philosopher sets a limit even to those things which are good in themselves.
For she that desires to appear too learned and eloquent, ought to wear a tunic reaching only to the middle of the leg, to sacri­ fice a pig to Sylvanus,3 and bathe for a quadrans.
Let not the matron that shares your marriage-bed possess a set style of eloquence, or hurl in well-rounded sentence the enthymeme curtailed 4 of its premiss;
nor be acquainted with all histories.
But let there be some things in books which she does not un­ derstand.
I hate her who is for ever poring over and study­ ing Palcemon's5 treatise;
who never violates the rules and principles of grammar;
and skilled in antiquarian lore, quotes verses I never knew;
and corrects the phrases of her friend as old-fashioned, I which men would never heed.
A husband should have the privilege of committing a solecism.
There is nothing a woman will not allow herself, nothing she holds disgraceful, when she has encircled her neck with emeralds, and inserted ear-rings of great size in her ears, stretched with their weight.
Nothing is more unbearable than a rich woman !
Meanwhile her face, shocking to look at, or ridiculous from the large poultice, is all swoln ;
or is redolent of rich Poppæan unguents,2 with which the lips of her wretched husband are glued up.
She will present herself to her adulterer with skin washed clean.
When does she choose to appear beauti­ ful at home ?
It is for the adulterers her perfumes are pre­ pared.
It is for these she purchases all that the slender In­ dians send us.
At length she uncases her face and removes the first layer.
She begins to be herself again ;
and bathes in that milk,3 for which she carries in her train she-asses, even if sent an exile to Hyperborean climes.
But that which is overlaid and fomented with so many and oft-changed cosmetics, and receives poultices of boiled and damp flour, shall we call it a face, I or a sore ?
It is worth while to find out exactly what their occupations and pursuits are through the livelong day.
If her husband has gone to sleep with his back towards her, the housekeeper is half killed,-the tire-women are stript to be whipped,-the Liburnian slave is accused of having come behind his time, and is forced to pay the penalty of another's sleep;
one has rods broken 2 about him, another bleeds from the whips, a third from the cow-hide.
Some women pay a regular salary to their torturers.
While he lashes she is employed in enamel­ ling her face.
She listens to her friend's chat, or examines the broad gold of an embroidered robe.
Still he lashes.
She pores over the items in her long diary.
3
Still he lashes.
Un­ til at length, when the torturers are exhausted, " Begone!"
she thunders out in awful voice, the inquisition being now complete.
The government of her house is no more merciful than the court of a Sicilian tyrant.
For if she has made an assign­ ation, and is anxious to be dressed out more becomingly than usual, and is in a hurry, and has been some time already waited for in the gardens, or rather near the chapels of the Isiac 4 procuress ;
poor Psecas arranges her hair, herself with dishevelled locks and naked shoulders and naked breasts.
"
Why is this curl too high ? "
Instantly the cow-hide avenges the heinous crime of the misplacing of a hair.
What has poor Psecas done ?
What crime is it of the poor girl's, if your own nose has displeased you ?
Another, on the left hand, draws out and combs her curls and rolls them into a band.
The aged matron assists at the council, who having served her due period 1 at the needle, now presides over weighing out the tasks of wool.
Her opinion will be first taken.
Then those who are her inferiors in years and skill will vote in order, as though their mistress's good name or life were at stake.
So great is the anxiety of getting beauty!
Into so many tiers she forms her curls, so many stages high she builds 2 her head ;
in front you will look upon an Andromache, behind she is a dwarf,-you would imagine her another person.
Excuse her, pray, if nature has assigned her but a short back, and if, without the aid of high-heeled buskins, she looks shorter than a Pigmy 3 maiden ;
and must spring lightly up on tiptoe for a kiss.
No thought meanwhile about her husband !
not a word of her ruinous expenditure !
She lives as though she were merely a neighbour 4 of her hus­ band's, and in this respect alone is nearer to him—that she hates her husband's friends and slaves, and makes grievous inroads on his purse.
But see!
the chorus of the maddened Bellona and the mother of the gods enters the house!
and the huge eunuch (a face to be revered by his obscene inferior) who long ago emasculated himself with a broken shell;
to whom his hoarse troop and the plebeian drummers give place, and whose cheek is covered with his Phrygian tiara.
With voice grandiloquent he bids her dread the approach of September and the autumn blasts, unless she purifies herself with a hecatomb of eggs, and makes a present to him of her cast-off murrey-coloured 1 robes :
that whatever unforeseen or mighty peril may be impending over her may pass into the tunics, and at once expiate the whole year.
She will break the ice and plunge into the river in the depth of winter, or dip three times in Tiber at early dawn, and bathe her timid head in its very eddies, and thence emerging will crawl on bleeding knees, naked and shivering, over the whole field of the haughty king.
2
If white Io com­ mand, she will go to the extremity of Egypt, and bring back water fetched from scorching Meroë, to sprinkle on the tem­ ple of Isis, that rears itself hard by the ancient sheep-fold.
3
For she believes that the warning is given her by the voice of the goddess herself.
And this, forsooth, is a fit soul and mind4 for the gods to hold converse with by night!
He there­ fore gains the chief and highest honour, who, surrounded by his linen-robed flock 5 and a bald-headed throng of people uttering lamentations, runs to and fro personating the grin­ ning Anubis.
He it is that supplicates for pardon whenever the wife does not refrain from nuptial joys on days to be ob­ served as sacred, and a heavy penalty is incurred from the violation of the snowy sheeting.
And the silver serpent was seen to nod his head!
His are the tears, and his the studied mumblings, that prevail on Osiris not to withhold pardon for her fault, when bribed by a fat goose and a thin cake.
When he has withdrawn, some trembling Jewess, having quitted her basket and hay, begs in her secret ear, the interpretess of the laws of Solyma, the potent priestess of the tree-the trusty go-between from highest heaven !1
And she crosses her hand with money, but sparingly enough:
for Jews will sell you any dreams you please for the minutest coin.
The soothsayer of Armenia or Commagene,2 handling the liver of the dove still reeking, engages that her lover shall be devoted, or promises the rich inheritance of some childless rich man;
he pries into the breasts of chickens and the entrails of a puppy ;
sometimes too even of a child — he does acts of which he will himself turn informer !
3,But their confidence in Chaldæans will be greater still:
whatever the astrologer tells them, they will believe reported straight from the fountain of Ammon;
since at Delphi the oracles are dumb, and darkness as to the future is the punish- ment of the human race.
However, of these he is in the highest repute who has been often banished ;
by whose friend­ ship and venal 1 tablets it came to pass that a citizen of high rank 2 died, and one dreaded by Otho.
Hence arises confidence in his art, if both his hands have clanked with chains, and he has been long an inmate of the camp-prison.
No astro­ loger that has never been condemned will have any reputa­ tion for genius:
but he that has hardly escaped with his life, and scarcely had good fortune enough to be sent to one of the Cyclades,3 and at length to be set free from the confined Seriphos, he it is whom your Tanaquil 4 consults about the death of her jaundiced mother, for which she has been long impatient:
but first, about yourself!
when she may hope to follow to the grave her sister and her uncles;
whether her adulterer will survive her, for what greater boon than this have the gods in their power to bestow ?
And yet she is ignorant what the ill-omened planet of Saturn forebodes ;
with what star Venus presents herself in fortunate conjunction;
what is the month for ill-luck;
what seasons are assigned to profit.
Remember to shun even a casual meeting with her in whose hands you see, like the unctuous amber,5 their calendars well thumbed;
who instead of consulting others is now herself consulted;
who when her husband is going to join his camp or revisit his home, will refuse to accompany him if restrained by the calculations of Thrasyllus.
1
When it is her fancy to ride as far as the first mile-stone, the lucky hour is taken from her book:
if the corner of her eye itches when she rubs it, she calls for ointment after a due inspection of her horoscope:
though she lies sick in bed no hour appears suited to taking food, save that which Petosiris 2 has directed.
If she be of moderate means, she will traverse the space on both sides of the pillars of the circus, and draw lots, and present her fore­ head and her hand to the fortune-teller that asks for the fre­ quent palming.
The rich will obtain answers from some soothsayer of Phrygia or India hired for the purpose, from some one skilled in the stars and heavens, or one advanced in years who expiates the public places which the lightning 3 has struck.
The destiny of the plebeians is learnt in the circus, and at Tarquin's rampart.
4
She that has no long necklace of gold to display, inquires in front of the obelisks and the dol­ phin-columns,5 whether she shall jilt the tapster and marry the old-clothes man.
Yet these, when circumstances so require, are ready to en­ counter the perils of childbirth, and endure all the irksome toils of nursing.
But rarely does a gilded bed contain a woman lying-in :
so potent are the arts and drugs of her that can insure barrenness, and for bribes kill men while yet un­ born.
Yet grieve not at this, poor wretch!
and with thine own hand give thy wife the potion, whatever it be:
for did she choose to bear her leaping children in her womb, thou wouldst perchance become the sire of an Æthiop;
a blacka­ moor would soon be your sole heir, one whom you would not see of a morning.!
I say nothing of supposititious children, and all a husband's joys and fond hopes baffled at the dirty pools ;
2 and the Pon­ tifices and Salii selected thence, who are to bear in their counterfeit persons the noble name of Scauri.
Fortune, that delights in mischief, takes her stand by night and smiles upon the naked babes.
All these she cherishes and fosters in her bosom:
then proffers them to the houses of the great, and prepares in secret a rich sport for herself.
These she dotes on :
3 on these she forces her favours ;
and smiling, leads them on to advancement as her own foster-children.
One fellow offers a wife magical incantations.
Another sells her love-potions from Thessaly, to give her power to disturb her husband's intellects, and punish him with the indignity of the slipper.
To these it is owing that you are reduced to dotage :
hence comes that dizziness of brain, that strange forgetfulness of things that you have but just now done.
Yet even this is endurable, if you do not go raving mad as well, like that uncle of Nero for whom his Cæsonia infused the whole forehead of a foal new-dropt.
Who will not follow where the empress leads ?
All things were wrapt in flames and with joints dis­ ruptured were tottering to their fall, exactly as if Juno had driven her spouse to madness.
Therefore the mushroom I of Agrippina had far less of guilt:
since that stopped the breath but of a single old man, and bade his trembling head descend to heaven,2 and his lips that slavered with dribbling saliva.
Whereas this potion of Cæsonia3 calls aloud for fire and sword and tortures, and mangles in one bloody mass both senators and knights.
So potent is a mare's offspring !
Such mighty ruin can one sorceress work !
Women hate their husbands' spurious issue.
No one would object to or forbid that.
But now it is thought allowable to kill even their husbands' sons by a former marriage.
Take my warning, ye that are under age and have a large estate, keep watch over your lives !
trust not a single dish!
The rich meats steam, livid with poison of your mother's mix­ ing.
Let some one take a bite before you of whatever -,-lie that bore you hands you ;
let your pedagogue, in terror of his life, be taster of your cups.
All this is our invention !
and Satire is borrowing the tragic buskin, forsooth;
and transgressing the limits prescribed by those who trod the path before us, we are wildly declaiming in the deep-mouthed tones of Sophocles4 a strain of awful grail­ deur, unknown to the Rutulian hills and Latin sky.
Would that it were but fable !
But Pontia5 with loud voice exclaims, " I did the deed.
I avow it!
and prepared for my own chil­ dren the aconite, which bears palpable evidence against me.
Still 1 the act was mine !" "
What, cruellest of vipers !
didst thou kill two at one meal!
Two, didst thou slay ?
"Ay, seven, had there haply been seven !
"Then let us believe to be true all that tragedians say of the fierce Colchian or of Progne.
I attempt not to gain­ say it.
Yet they perpetrated atrocities that were monstrous even in their days-but not for the sake of money.
Less amazement is excited even by the greatest enormities, when­ ever rage incites this sex to crime, and with fury burning up their very liver, they are carried away headlong;
like rocks torn away from cliffs, from which the mountain-height is reft away, and the side recedes from the impending mass.
I cannot endure the woman that makes her calculations, and in cold blood perpetrates a heinous crime.
They sit and see Alcestis2 on the stage encountering death for her husband, and were a similar exchange allowed to them, would gladly purchase a lap-dog's life by the sacrifice of their husband's!
You will meet any morning with Danaides and Eriphylce in plenty;
not a street but will possess its Clytæmnestra.
This is the only difference, that that famed daughter of Tyndarus grasped in both hands a bungling, senseless axe.3
But now the business is despatched with the insinuating venom of a toad.
But yet with the steel too ;
if her Atrides has been cautious enough to fortify himself with the Pontic antidotes of the thrice-conquered 4 king.
ALL our hope and inducement to study I tests on Caesar alone.
For he alone casts a favouring eye3 on the Muses, who in our days are in a forlorn state.
When poets, now become famous and men of renown, would fain try and hire a little bath at Gabii, or a public oven at Rome.
While others, again, would esteem it neither shocking nor degrading to turn public criers:
since Clio herself, if starving, would quit the vales of Aganippe, and emigrate to courts.
4
For if not a singles farthing is offered you in the Pierian shades, be content with\ the name and calling of Machaera :
5 and sooner sell what the auction duly set6 sells to those that stand around ;
wine­ flagons, trivets, book-cases, chests ;
the " Alcyone" of Paccius, or the " Thebes" and " Tereus" of Faustus.
This is prefer­ able to asserting before the judge that you are a witness of, what you never did see.
7 Even though Asiatic,8 and Cappa­ docian, and Bithynian knights stoop to this:
fellows whom Gallo-Gnesia transports hither with chalked feet.
9
Here- after, however, no one will be compelled to submit to an em­ ployment derogatory to his studies, who unites loftiness of expression to tuneful numbers, and has chewed the bay.
1
Set vigorously to work then, young men !
The kindness2 of the emperor is looking all around, and stimulates your exertions, while he is seeking worthy objects of his patronage.
N
If you think that from any other quarter you may look for encourage-, ment in your pursuits, and with that view fill the parchment of your yellow3 tablet;
call with all speed for a faggot, and make a present of all your compositions, Telesinus, to Ven us' husband:
4 or lock them up, and let the bookworm5 bore them through as they lie stowed away.
Destroy your pens, poor wretch !
Blot out your battles that have lost you your nights' rest, you that write sublime poetry in your narrow garret,6 that you may come forth worthy of an ivy-crown and meagre image.
You have nothing further to hope for.
The stingy patron of our days has learnt only to admire and praise the eloquent as boys do Juno's peacock.
7
But your prime of life is ebbing away;
that is able to bear the fatigue of the sea, the helmet, or the spade.
Then weariness creeps over the spirits:
and an old age, that is indeed learned but in rags 8 curses itself and the Muses that it courted.
Now learn the devices of the great man you pay court to, to avoid laying out any money upon you:
quitting the temple of the Muses, and Apollo, he composes verses himself, and only yields the palm to Homer himself on the score of his priority by a thousand years.
But if inflamed by the charms of fame you recite your poetry, he kindly lends you a dirty mansion, and places at your service one that has been long barred up, whose front gate emulates those of a city in a state of siege.
He knows how to place his freedmen in seats at the farther end of the audience, and how to arrange his clients who are to cheer you lustily.
1
None of these great lords will give you as much as would pay for the benches,2 or the seats that rise one above another on the platform you have to hire;
or your orchestra of chairs, which must be returned when your recit­ ation is over.
Yet still we ply our tasks, and draw furrows in the profitless dust, and keep turning up the sea-shore with sterile plough.
For even if you try to abandon the pursuit, the long habit 3 of indulging in this vain-glorious trifling,4 holds you fast in its fetters.
An inveterate itch of writing, now incurable, clings to many, and grows old in their distempered body.
But the poet that is above his fellows, whose vein is not that of the common herd;
that is wont to spin out no stale or vulgar subject, and stamps no hackneyed verse from a die that all may use;
such an one as I cannot embody in words, and can only feel in my soul, is the offspring of a mind free from solicitude, exempt from all that can embitter life, that courts the quiet of the woods, and loves to drink the fountains of the Aonides.
Nor can it be that poverty should sing in the Pierian cave, or handle the thyrsus, if forced to sobriety, and lacking that vile penthe body needs both day and night.
Well plied with food and wine is Horace when he shouts out his Evoe ! 1
What scope is there for fancy, save when our breasts are harassed by no thoughts but verse alone ;
and are hurried along 2 under the influence of the lords of Cirrha and Nysa, admitting of no divided3 solicitude.
It is the privilege of an exalted soul, and not of one bewildered how to get enough to buy a blanket, to gaze on chariots and horses and the forms of divinities, and in what dread shapes Erinnys4 appals the Rutulian.
For had Virgil lacked a slave and comfortable lodging, all the serpents would have vanished froa-Alecto's hair:
his trumpet, starved to silence, would have blazed no note of terror.
Is it fair to expect that Ruprenus Lappa should not fall short of the buskin of the ancients, while his Atreus5 forces him to pawn his very sauceboats and his cloak ?
Poor Numitor is so unfortunate as to have nothing he can afford to send his protégé !
Yet he can find something to give Quintilla,—he managed to pay for a tame lion, that must have pounds of flesh to feed him.
No doubt the huge beast is kept at far less expense;
and a poet's stomach is far more capa­ cious !
Let Lucan recline at his ease in his gardens among his marble statues, satisfied with fame alone.
But to poor Serranus, and starving Saleius, of what avail will glory be, however great, if it be glory only ?
All flock in crowds to hear his sweet voice, and the tuneful strains of the Thebais, when Statius1 has gladdened the city, and fixed the day for reciting it.
So great is the charm with which he captivates their souls;
such the eager delight with which lie is listened to by the multitude.
But when the very benches are broken down by the ecstasies with which his verses are applauded, he may starve, unless he sells2 his unpublished "Agave "3 to Paris.
It is he that bestows on many the honours due to military service, and encircles the fingers of poets with the ring that marks their six-months' command.
4
What nobles will not give, a player will!
And dost thou, then, still pay court to the Camerini and Bareæ, and the spacious halls of nobles ?
It is "Pelopea" that makes prefects, "Philomela" tribunes.
Yet envy not the bard whom the stage maintains.
Who is your Mæcenas now, or Proculeius, or Fabius ?
Who will act Cotta's part again, or be a second Lentulus ?
In those days talent had its meet reward:
then it was profitable to many to become pale, and abstain from wine the whole of December.
Your toil, forsooth, ye writers of histories !
is more profit­ able, it requires more time and more oil.
For regardless of all limit, it rises to the thousandth page ;
and grows in bulk, expensive from the mass of paper used.
This the vast press of matter requires, and the laws of composition.
Yet what is the crop that springs from it ?
what the profit from the soil upturned ?
Who will give an historian as much as he would a notary?
1 "But they are an idle race, that delight in sofas and the cool shade."
Well, tell me then, what do the services rendered their fellow citizens, and their briefs they carry about with them in a big bundle, bring in to the lawyers ?
Even of themselves, they talk grandly enough, but especially when their creditor is one of their hearers;
or if one still more pressing nudges their side, that comes with his great account- book to sue for a doubtful debt.
Then the hollow bellows of their lungs breathe forth amazing lies ;
they foam at the mouth till their breast is covered.
But if you like to calculate the I actual harvest they reap, set in one scale the estate of a hun­ dred lawyers, and yon may balance it on the other side with the single fortune of Lacerna, the charioteer of the Red.
2
The chiefs have taken their seats !3
You, like Ajax, rise with pallid cheek, and plead in behalf of liberty that has been called in question, before a neat-herd 4 for a juryman !
Burst your strained lungs, poor wretch !
that, when exhausted, the green palm-branches 5 may be affixed to crown your stair­ case with honour !
Yet what is the reward of your eloquence ?
A rusty ham, or a dish of sprats ;
or some shrivelled onions, the monthly provender of the Africans ;
1 or wine brought down the Tiber.
Five bottles2 for pleading four times !
If you have been lucky enough to get a single gold pieee,3 even from that you must deduct the stipulated shares of the at­ torneys.
4
Æmilius will get as much as the law allows ;
5 al­ though we pleaded better than he.
For he has in his court­ yard a chariot of bronze with four tall horses6 yoked to it ;
and he himself, seated on his fierce charger, brandishes aloft his bending spear, and meditates battles with his one eye closed.
So it is that Pedo gets involved, Matho fails.
This is the end of Tongillus, who usually bathes with a huge rhinoceros' horn of oil, and annoys the baths with his draggled train ;
and weighs heavily in his ponderous sedan on his sturdy Median slaves, as he presses through the forum to bid for7 slaves, and plate, and myrrhine vases, and villas.
For it is his foreign 1 purple with its Tyrian tissue that gets him credit.
And yet this answers their purpose.
It is the purple robe that gets the lawyer custom—his violet cloaks that attract clients.
It suits their interest to live with all the bustle and outward show of an income greater than they really have.
But pro­ digal Rome observes no bounds to her extravagance.
If the old orators were to come to life again, no one now would give even Cicero himself two hundred sesterces, unless a huge ring sparkled on his finger.
This is the first point he that goes to law looks to-whether you have eight slaves, ten attendants, a sedan to follow you, and friends in toga to go before.
Paulus, consequently, used to plead in a sardonyx, hired for the occasion:
and hence it was that Cossus' fees were higher than those of Basilus.
Eloquence is a rare quality in a thread-bare coat fWhen is Basilus allowed to produce in court a weeping mother ?
Who could endure Basilus, however well he were to plead ?"
Let Gaul become your home, or better still that foster-nurse of pleaders, Africa, if you are determined to let your tongue for hire.
Do you teach declamation ?
Oh what a heart of steel must Vectius have, when his numerous' class kills cruel tyrants !
For all that the boy has just conned over at his seat, he will then stand up and spout,-the same stale theme in the same sing-song.
It is the reproduction of the cabbage2 that wears out the master's life.
What isthe plea to be urged;
what the character of the cause;
where the main point of the case hinges ;
what shafts may issue from the opposing party ;
— this all are anxious to know;
but not one is anxious to pay ! "
Pay do you ask for ?
why, what do I know ?"
The blame, forsooth, is laid at the teacher's door, because there is not a spark of energy in the breast of this scion of Arcadia,1 who dins his awful Hannibal into my ears regularly every sixth day.
Whatever the theme be that is to be the subject of his deliberation ;
whether he shall march at once from Cannæ on Rome ;
or whether, rendered circumspect after the storms and thunderbolts, he shall lead his cohorts, drenched with the tempest, by a circuitous route.
Bargain2 for any sum you please, and I will at once place it in your hands, on condition that his father should hear him his lesson as often as I have to do it!
But six or more sophists are all giving tongue at once;
and, debating in good earnest, have abandoned all fic­ titious declamations about the ravisher.
No more is heard of the poison infused, or the vile ungrateful husband,3 or the drugs that can restore the aged blind to youth.
He therefore that quits the shadowy conflicts of rhetoric for the arena of real debate, will superannuate himself, if my advice has any.
weight with him, and enter on a different path of life;
that he may not lose even the paltry sum that will purchase the miserable ticket4 for corn.
Since this-is the most splendid reward you can expect.
Just inquire what Chrysogonus receives, or Pollio, for teaching the sons of these fine gentle­ men, and going into all the details5 of Theodorus' treatise.
The baths will cost six hundred sestertia, and the colon­ nade still more, in which the great man rides whenever it rains.
Is he to wait, forsooth, for fair weather ?
or bespatter his horses with fresh mud ?
Nay, far better here !
for here the mule's hoof shines unsullied.
1
On the other side must rise a spacious dining-room, supported on stately columns of Numidian marble, and catch the cooP sun.
However much the house may have cost, he will have besides an artiste who can arrange his table scientifically;
another, who can season made-dishes.
Yet amid all this lavish expenditure, two poor sestertia will be deemed an ample remuneration for Quinti­ lian.
Nothing will cost a father less than his son's education."
Then where did Quintilian get the money to pay for so many estates ?"
Pass by the instances of good fortune that are but rare indeed.
It is good luck that makes a man hand­ some and active;
good luck that makes him wise, and noble, and well-bred, and attaches the crescent of the senator to his black shoe.
Good luck too that makes him the best of orators and debaters, and, though he has a vile cold, sing well!
For it makes all the difference what planets welcome you when you first begin to utter your infant cry, and are still red from your mother.
If fortune so wills it, you will become consul instead of rhetorician ;
vor, if she will, instead of rhetorician, consul !
What was Ventidi us1 or Tullius ought else than a lucky planet, and the strange potency of hidden fate?
Fate, that gives kingdoms to slaves, and triumphs to captives.
Yes !
Quintilian was indeed lucky, but he is a greater rarity even than a white erow.
But many a man has repented of this fruitless and barren employment, as the sad end of Thrasymachus2 proves, and that of Secundus Carrinas.3
And ' you too, Athens, were witness to-the poverty of him on whom , you had the heart to bestow nothing save the hemlock thaf chilled4 his life-blood!
Light be the earth, ye gods!
5 and void of weight, that presses on our grandsires' shades, "and round their urn bloom fragrant crocus and eternal spring, who maintained that a tutor should hold the place and honour of a revered parent.
Achilles sang on his paternal hills, in terror of the lash, though now grown up:
and yet in whom even then would not the tail of his master, the harper, provoke a smile ?
But now Rufus6 and others are beaten each by their own pupils ;
Rufus !
who so often called Cicero " the Allobrogian !"
Who casts into Enceladus'1 lap, or that of the learned Palæmon,2 as much as their grammarian labours have merited ?
And yet even from this wretched sum, however small, (and it is smaller than the rhetorician's pay,) Acænonoëtus, his pupil's pedagogue, first takes his slice;
and then the steward who pays you de­ ducts his fragment.
Dispute it not, Palæmon !
and suffer some abatement to be made, just as the pedlar does that deals in winter rugs and snow-white sheetings.
3
Only let not all be lost,4 for which you have sat from the midnight hour, when no smith would sit, nor even he that teaches how to draw out wool with the oblique iron.
Lose not your whole reward for having smelt as many lamps as there were boys standing -round you ;
while Horace was altogether discoloured, and the foul smut clave to the well-thumbed Maro.
Yet rare too is the pay that does not require enforcing by the Tribune's court.
5
But do you, parents, impose severe exactions on him that is to teach your boys;
that he be perfect in the rules of grammar for each word—read all histories6—know all authors as well as his own finger-ends ;
-that if questioned at hazard, while on his way to the Thérmæ or the baths of Phoebus, he should be able to tell the name of Anchises' nurse,7 and the name and native land of the step-mother of Anchemolus—tell off-hand how many years Acestes lived-how many flagons of wine the Sicilian king gave to the Phrygians.
Require of him that he mould their youthful morals as one models a face in wax.
Require of him that he be the reverend father of the company, and check every approach to immorality.
It is no light task to keep watch over so many boyish hands, so many little twinkling eyes.—" This," says the father, "be the object of your care!"—and when the year comes round again, Receive for your pay as much gold1 as the people demand for the victorious Charioteer !
WHAT is the use of pedigrees?
2
What boots it, Ponticus, to be accounted of an ancient line, and to display the painted faces 3 of your ancestors, and the Æmiliani standing in their ears, and the Curii diminished to one-half their bulk, and Corvinus deficient of a shoulder, and Galba that has lost his ears and nose4—what profit is it to vaunt in your capacious genealogy of Corvinus, and in many a collateral line4 to trace dictators and masters of the horse begrimed with smoke, if before the very faces of the Lepidi you lead an evil life ?
To what pur­ pose are the images of so many warriors, if the dice-box rat­ tles all night long in the presence of the Numantini :
5 if you retire to rest at the rising of that star,6 at whose dawning those generals set their standards and camps in motion ?
Why does Fabius plume himself on the Allobrogici and the " Great Altar," as one born in Hercules' own household, if he is covet­ ous, empty-headed, and ever so much more effeminate than the soft lamb of Euganea.
2
If with tender limbs made sleek by the pumice3 of Catana he shames his rugged sires, and, a purchaser of poison, disgraces his dishonoured race by his image that ought to be broken up.
4
Though your long line of ancient statues adorn your ample halls on every side, the sole and only real nobility is virtue.
Be a Paulus,5 or Cossus, or Drusus, in moral character.
Set that before the images of your ancestors.
Let that, when you are consul, take precedence of the fasces themselves.
What I claim from you first is the noble qualities of the mind.
If you deserve indeed to be accounted a man of blameless in­ tegrity, and staunch love of justice, both in word and deed, then I recognise the real nobleman.
All hail, Gætulicus !
6 or thou, Silanus,l or from whatever other blood descended, a rare and illustrious citizen, thou fallest to the lot of thy rejoicing country.
Then we may exultingly shout out what the people exclaim when Osiris is found.
2For who would call him noble that is unworthy of his race, and distinguished only for his illustrious name ?
We call some one's dwarf,3 Atlas;
a negro, swan;
a diminutive and deformed wench, Europa.
Lazy curs scabbed 4 with inveterate mange, that lick the edges of the lamp now dry, will get the name of Leopard, Tiger, Lion, or whatever other beast there is on earth that roars with fiercer throat.
Therefore you will take care and begin to fear lest it is upon the same princi­ ple you are a Creticus5 or Camerinus.
Whom have I admonished in these words ?
To you my words are addressed, Rubellius6 Plautus!
You are puffed up with your descent from the Drusi, just as though you had yourself achieved something to deserve being ennobled;
and she that gave you birth should be of the brilliant blood of lulus, and not the drudge that weaves for hire beneath the shelter of the windy rampart.
1 "You are the lower orders!" he says;
" the very dregs of our populace !
Not a man of you could tell where his father was born !
But I am a Cecropid ! "
Long may you live 2 and long revel in the joys of such a descent!
Yet from the lowest of this common herd you will find one that is indeed an eloquent Roman.
It is he that usually pleads the cause of the ignorant noble.
3
From the toga'd crowd will come one that can solve the knotty points of law, and the enigmas of the statutes.
He it is that in his prime carves out his fortune with his sword, and goes to Euphrates, and the legions that keep guard over the conquered Batavi.
While you are nothing but a Ceeropid, and most like the shapeless pillar crowned with Hermes' head.
Since in no other point of difference have you the advantage save in this-that his head is of marble,4 and your image is endowed with life !
Tell me, descendant of the Teucri, who considers dumb animals highly bred, unless strong and courageous ?
Surely it is on this score we praise the fleet horse-to grace whose speed full many a palm glows,5 and Victory, in the circus hoarse with shouting, stands exulting by.
He is the steed of fame, from whatever pasture he comes, whose speed is brilliantly be­ fore the others, and whose dust is first on the plain.
But the brood of Corytha, and Hirpinus' stock, are put up for sale if victory sit but seldom on their yoke.
In their case no re- gard is had to their pedigree,-their dead sires win them no favour,-they are forced to change their owners for paltry prices, and draw waggons with galled withers, if slow of foot, and only fit to turn Nepos’1 mill.
Therefore that we may ad­ mire you, and not yours, first achieve some noble act2 that I may inscribe on your statue's base, besides those honours that we pay, and ever shall pay, to those to whom you are indebted for all.
Enough has been said to the youth whom common report represents to us as.
haughty and puffed up from his relation­ ship to Nero.3
For in that rank of life the courtesies 4 of good breeding are commonly rare enough.
But you, Ponticus, I would not have you valued for your ancestors' renown, so as to contribute nothing yourself to deserve the praise of pos­ terity.
It is wretched work building on another's fame;
lest the whole pile crumble into ruins when the pillars that held it up are withdrawn.
The vine that trails along the ground sighs for its widowed elms in vain.
Prove yourself a good soldier, a faithful guardian, an in­ corruptible judge.
If ever you shall be summoned as a witness in a doubtful and uncertain cause, though Phalaris himself command you to turn liar, and dictate the perjuries with his bull placed before your eyes, deem it to be the sum­ mit of impiety1 to prefer existence to honour,2 and for the sake of life to sacrifice life's only end !
He that deserves to die is dead, though he still sup on a hundred Gauran 3 oysters, and plunge in a whole bath of the perfumes of Cosmus.
4
When your long-expected province shall at length receive you for its ruler, set a bound to your passion, put a curb on your avarice.
Have pity on our allies whom we have brought to poverty.
You see the very marrow drained from the empty bones of kings.
Have respect to what the laws pre­ scribe, the senate enjoins.
Remember what great rewards await the good, with how just a stroke ruin lighted on Capito5 and Numitor, those pirates of the Cilicians, when the senate fulminated its decree against them.
But what avails their condemnation, when Pansa plunders you of all that Natta left ?
Look out for an auctioneer to sell your tattered clothes, Chærippus, and then hold your tongue !
It is sheer madness to lose, when all is gone, even Charon's fee.
1
There were not the same lamentations of yore, nor was the wound inflicted on our allies by pillage as great as it is now, while they were still flourishing, and but recently conquered.
2
Then every house was full, and a huge pile of money stood heaped up, cloaks from Sparta, purple robes from Cos, and along with pictures by Parrhasius and statues by Myro, the ivory of Phidias seemed instinct with life ;
3 and many a work from Polycletus' hand in every house;
few were the tables that could not show a cup of Mentors chasing.
Then came Dolabella,4 and then Antony, then the sacrilegious Verres ;
5 they brought home in their tall 6 ships the spoils they dared not show, and more7 triumphs from peace than were ever won from war.
Now our allies have but few yokes of oxen, a small stock of brood-mares, and the patriarch 8 of the herd will be harried from the pasture they have already taken pos­ session of.
Then the very Lares themselves, if there is any statue worth looking at, if any little shrine still holds its single god.
For this, since it is the best they have, is the highest prize they can seize upon.
You may perhaps despise the Rhodians unfit for war, and essenced Corinth;
and well you may!
How can a resin- smeared I youth, and the depilated legs of a whole nation, re­ taliate upon you.
You must keep clear of rugged Spain, the Gallic car,2 and the Illyrian coast.
Spare too those reapers 3 that overstock the city, and give it leisure for the circus 4 and the stage.
Yet what rewards to repay so atrocious a crime could you carry off from thence, since Marius 5 has so lately plundered the impoverished Africans even of their very girdles ?
6You must be especially cautious lest a deep injury be in­ flicted on those who are bold as well as wretched.
Though you may strip them of all the gold and silver they possess, you will yet leave them shield and sword, and javelin and helm.
Plundered of all, they yet have arms to spare !
What I have just set forth is no opinion of my own.
Be­ lieve that I am reciting to you a leaf of the sibyl, that cannot lie.
If your retinue are men of spotless life, if no favourite youth 7 barters your judgments for gold, if your wife 8 is clear from all stain of guilt, and does not prepare to go through the district courts,9 and all the towns of your province, ready, like a Celæno1 with her crooked talons, to swoop upon the gold, -then you may, if you please, reckon your descent from Picus ;
and if high-sounding names are your fancy, place the whole army of Titans among your ancestors, or even Prome­ theus2 himself.
Adopt a founder of your line from any book you please.
But if ambition and lust hurry you away head­ long, if you break your rods3 on the bloody backs of the allies, if your delight is in axes blunted by the lictor worn out with using them,-then the nobility of your sires themselves begins to rise in judgment against you, and hold forth a torch to blaze upon your shameful deeds.
5
Every act of moral tur­ pitude incurs more glaring reprobation in exact proportion to the-rank of him that commits it.
Why vaunt your pedigree to me ?
you, that are wont to put your name to forged deeds in the very temples6 which your grandsire built, before your very fathers triumphal statues !
or, an adulterer that dares not face the day, you veil your brows concealed beneath a Santon7 cowl.
The bloated Damasippus is whirled in his rapid car past the ashes and bones of his ancestors-and with his own hands, yes !
though consul!
with his own hands locks his wheel with the frequent drag-chain.
1
It is, indeed, at night.
But still the moon sees him!
The stars strain on him their attesting eyes.
2
When the period of his magistracy is closed, Damasippus3 will take whip in band in the broad glare of day, and never dread meeting his friend now grown old, and will be the first to give him the coachman's salute, and untie the trusses and pour the barley4 before his weary steeds himself.
Meantime, even while according to Numa's ancient rites he sacrifices the woolly victim and the stalwart bull be­ fore Jove's altar, he swears by Epona5 alone, and the faces daubed over the stinking stalls.
But when he is pleased to repeat his visits to the taverns open all night long, the Syro­ phoenician, reeking with his assiduous perfume,6 runs to meet him, (the Syrophœnician that dwells at the Idumæan7 gate,) with all the studied courtesy of a host, he salutes him as “lord”8 and “king and Cyane, with gown tucked up, with her bot­ tle for sale.
One who wishes to palliate his crime will say to me, " Well;
we did so too when we were young !”
Granted.
But surely you left off, and did not indulge in your folly be­ yond that period.
Let what you basely dare | be ever brief!
There are some faults that should be shorn away with our first beard.
Make all reasonable allowance for boys.
But Damasippus frequents those debauches of the bagnios, and the painted signs,1 when of ripe age for war, for guarding Armenia2 and Syria's rivers, and the Rhine or Danube.
His time of life qualifies him to guard the emperor's person.
Send then to Ostia!
3 Cæsar—send !
But look for your general in some great tavern.
You will find him reclining with some common cut-throat;
in a medley of sailors, and thieves, and run-away slaves ;
among executioners and cheap coffin- makers,4 and the now silent drums of the priest of Cybele, lying drunk on his back.
5
There there is equal liberty for all —cups in common-nor different couch for any, or table set aloof from the herd.
What would you do, Ponticus, were it your lot to have a slave of such a character ?
Why surely you would despatch him to the Lucanian or Tuscan bridewells.
6
But you, ye Trojugenæ !
find excuses for yourselves, and what would disgrace a cobler1 will be becoming in a Volesus or Brutus !
What if we never produce examples so foul and shameful, that worse do not yet remain behind !
When all your wealth - was squandered, Damasippus, you let your voice for hire2 to the stager to act the noisy Phasma4 of Catullus.
Velox Len­ tulus acted Laureolus, and creditably too.
In my judgment he deserved crucifying in earnest.
Nor yet can you acquit the people themselves from blame.
The brows of the people are too hardened that sit5 spectators of the buffooneries of the patricians, listen to the Fabii with naked feet, and laugh at the slaps on the faces of the Mamerci.
What matters it at what price they sell their lives:
they sell them at no tyrant's compulsion,6 [nor hesitate7 to do it even at the games of the prætor seated on high.]
Yet imagine the gladiator's sword1 on one side, the stage on the other.
Which is the better alter- native ?
Has any one so slavish a dread of death as to become the jealous lover of Thymele,2 the colleague of the heavy Corinthus ?
Yet it is nothing to be wondered at, if the emperor turn harper, that the nobleman should turn actor.
To crown all this, what is left but the amphitheatre ?3
And this disgrace of the city you have as well-Gracchus4 not fighting equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or faulchion, (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such an equipment.)
Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet.
See!
he wields a trident.
When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his un­ covered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognised, flees across the whole arena.
We cannot mistake the tunica since the riband of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap.
Therefore the dis­ grace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.
Were the people allowed the uncontrolled exercise of their votes, who could be found so abandoned as to hesitate to prefer Seneca6 to Nero.
For whose punishment there should have been pre­ pared not a single ape only, or one snake or sack.
8 " His crime is matched by that of Orestes ! "1 But it is the motive cause that gives the quality to the act.
Since he, at the in­ stigation of the gods themselves, was the avenger of his father butchered in his cups.
But he neither imbrued his hands in Electra's blood, or that of his Spartan wife;
he mixed no aconite for his relations.
Orestes never sang on the stage ;
he never wrote “ Troïcs.”
What blacker crime was there for Virginius’2 arms to avenge, or Galba leagued with Vindex ?
In all his tyranny, cruel and bloody as it was, what exploit did Nero3 achieve?
These are the works, these the accom­ plishments of a high-born prince-delighting to prostitute4 his rank by disgraceful dancing on a foreign stage, and earn the parsley of the Grecian crown.
Array the statues of your ancestors in the trophies of your voice.
At Domitius' feet lay the long train of Thyestes, or Antigone, or Menalippe's mask, and hang your harp6 on the colossus of marble.

What could any one find more noble than thy birth, Cati­ line, or thine, Cethegus !
Yet ye prepared arms to be used by night, and flames for our houses and temples, as though ye had been the sons of the Braccati,l or descendants of the Senones.
Attempting what one would be justified in punishing by the pitched shirty
But the consul is on the watch3 and restrains your bands.
He whom you sneer at as a novus 4 homo from Arpinum, of humble birth, and but lately made a municipal knight at Rome, disposes every where his armed guards to protect the terrified people, and exerts himself in every quar­ ter.
Therefore the peaceful toga, within the walls, bestowed on him such honours and renown as not even Octavius bore away from Leucas5 or the plains of Thessaly, with sword reek­ ing with unintermitted slaughter.
But Rome owned him for a parent.
Rome, when unfettered,6 hailed Cicero as father of his father-land.
Another native of Arpinum was wont to ask for his wages when wearied with another's plough on the Volscian hills.
After that, he had the knotted vine-stick7 broken about his head, if lie lazily fortified the camp with sluggard axe.
Yet lie braved the Cimbri, and the greatest perils of the state, and alone protected the city in her alarm.
And therefore when the ravens, that had never lighted on bigger carcases,l flocked to the slaughtered heaps of Cimbrians slain, his nobly-born colleague is honoured with a laurel inferior to his.
2The souls of the Decii were plebeian, their very names ple­ beian.
Yet these are deemed by the infernal deities and mother Earth a fair equivalent for the whole legions, and all the forces of the allies, and all the flower of Latium.
For the Decii3 were more highly valued by them than all they died to save!
It was one born from a slave 4 that won the robe and dia­ dem and fasces of Quirinus, that last of good kings!
They that were for loosening the bolts of the gates betrayed to the exiled tyrants, were the sons of the consul himself!
men from whom we might have looked for some glorious achievement in behalf of liberty when in peril;
some act that Mucius’ self, or Codes, might admire ;
and the maiden that swam across 5 the Tiber, then the limit of our empire.
He that divulged to the fathers the secret treachery was a slave,6 afterwards to be mourned for by all the Roman matrons:
while they suffer the well-earned punishment of the scourge, and the axe,l then first used by Rome since she became republican.
I had rather that Thersites2 were your sire, provided you resembled Æacides and could wield the arms of Vulcan, than that Achilles should beget you to be a match to Thersites.
And yet, however far you go back, however far you trace your name, you do but derive your descent from the infamous sanctuary.
3
That first of your ancestors, whoever he was, was either a shepherd, or else,-what I would rather not mention !
I SHOULD like to know, Nævolus,4 why you so often meet me with clouded brow forlorn, like Marsyas after his defeat.
What have you to do with such a face as Ravola had when detected with his Rhodope ?5
We give a slave a box on the ear, if he licks the pastry.
Why !
Crepereius Pollio6 had not a more woe-begone face than yours ;
he that went about ready to pay three times the ordinary interest, and could find none fools enough to trust him.
Where do so many wrinkles come from all of a sudden ?
Why, surely before, contented with little, you used to live like a gentleman's gentleman —a witty boon-companion with your biting jest, and sharp at repartees that savour of town-life !
Now all is the reverse;
your looks are dejected;
your tangled hair bristles like a thicket;
1 there is none of that sleek­ ness over your whole skin, such as the Bruttian plaster of hot pitch used to give you ;
but your legs are neglected and rank with a shrubbery of hair.
What means this emaciated form, like that of some old invalid parched this many a day with quartan ague and fever that has made his limbs its home ?
You may detect2 the anguish of-themind that lurks in the sickly body-and discover its joys also.
For the face, the index of the mind, takes its complexion from each.
You seem, therefore, to have changed your course of life, and to run counter to your former habits.
For, but lately, as I well remember, you used to haunt the temple of Isis,3 and the statue of Ganymede in the temple of Peace,4 and the secret palaces of the imported mother5 of the gods ;
ay, and Ceres too, (for what temple is there in which you may not find a woman,)—a more notorious adulterer even than Aufidius, and under the rose, not confining your attentions to the wives !“
Yes :
even this way of life is profitable to many.
But I never made it worth my while :
we do occasionally get greasy cloaks, that serve to save our toga, of coarse texture and in­ different dye, the clumsy workmanship of some French weaver's lay;
or a small piece of silver of inferior metal.
1
The Fates control the destinies of men :
nay, there is fate even in those very parts which the lap of the toga conceals from view.
For if the stars are unpropitious, your manly powers, remaining unknown, will profit you nothing, even though the liquorish Virro has seen you stript, and seductive billets-doux, closely following each other, are for ever assail­ ing you:
for such a fellow as he even entices others to sin.
Yet, what monster can be worse than one miserly as well as effeminate?
2 "I gave you so much, then so much, and then soon after you had more ! "
He reckons up and still acts the wanton. "
Let us settle our accounts !
Send for the slaves with my account-book!
Reckon up five thousand sesterces in all!
Then count up your services ! "
Are then my duties so light, and so little against the grain ?
Far less wretched will be the poor slave that digs the great man's land !
But you, forsooth, thought yourself delicate, and young, and beau­ tiful !
fit to be cup-bearer in heaven !
Will you ever bestow favours on a humble dependant, or be generous to one that pays you court, when you grudge even the money you spend on your unnatural 3 gratifications?
See the fellow !
to whom you are to send a present of a green parasol and large amber 4 bowls, as often as his birth-day comes round, or rainy spring begins ;
or pillowed on his cushioned sofa, he fingers presents set apart for the female Kalends!
5
Tell me, you sparrow, for whom it is you are keeping so many hills, so many Apulian 1 farms, so many kites wearied in flying across your pastures ?
Your Trifoline estate enriches you with its fruitful vines;
and the hill that looks down 3 on Cumæ, and caverned Gaurus.
Who seals up more4 casks of wine that will bear long keeping ?
How great a matter would it be to present the loins of your client, worn out in your service, with a few acres?
Would yon rustic child, with his mother, and her hovel,5 and his playmate cur, more justly become the inheritance of your cymbal-beating friend ?
"You are a most importunate beggar!" he says:
But Rent cries out to me "Beg ! ” My only slave calls on me to beg !
loudly as Polyphemus6 with his one broad eye, by which the crafty Ulysses made his escape.
I shall be compelled to buy a second, for this one is not enough for me ;
both must be fed.
What shall I do in mid-winter ?
When the chill north wind whistles in December,l what shall I say, pray, to my poor slaves' naked feet and shoulders ? "
Courage,2 my boys !
and wait for the grasshoppers ? "
But however you may dis­ semble and pass by all other matters, at how much do you estimate it, that had I not been your devoted client your wife would still remain a maid ?
At all events, you know all about those services, how hard you begged, how much you promised !
Often when your young wife was eloping, I caught her in my embrace.
She had actually torn 3 the marriage contract, and was on the point of signing a new one.
It was with dif­ ficulty that I set this matter right by a whole night's work, while you stood whimpering outside the door.
I appeal to the bed as my witness !
nay, to yourself, who heard the noise, and the lady's cries !
In many a house, when the marriage bonds were growing feeble and beginning to give way, and were almost severed, an adulterer has set all matters right.
How­ ever you may shift your ground, whatever services you may reckon first or last, is it indeed no obligation, ungrateful and perfidious man !
is it none, that you have an infant son or daughter born to you through me ?
For you bring them up as yours !
and plume yourself on inserting at intervals in the public registers4 these evidences of your virility !
Hang gar­ lands5 on your doors !
You are now a father !
I have given you what you may cast in slander's teeth !
You have a fa­ ther's privileges ;
through me you may inherit a legacy, yes, the whole sum 1 left to you, not to mention some pleasant windfall!
2 Besides, many other advantages will be added to these windfalls, if I make the number complete and add a third!”"
Your ground of complaint is just indeed, Nævolus :
what does he allege in answer?""
He casts me off, and looks out for some other two-legged ass to serve his turn ?
But remember that these secrets are in­ trusted to you alone ;
keep them to yourself, therefore, buried in the silence of your own breast;
for one of these pumice- smoothed 3 fellows is a deadly thing if he becomes your enemy.
He that intrusted his secret to me but the other day, now is furious, and detests me just as though I had divulged all I know.
He does not hesitate to use his dagger, to break my skull with a bludgeon, or place a firebrand at my doors:
4 and deem it no light or contemptible matter that to men of his wealth the price of poison is never too costly.
Therefore you must keep my secrets as religiously as the court of Mars at Athens.""
Oh !
Corydon,5 poor simple Corydon !
Do you think aught that a rich man does can be secret ?
Even though his slaves should hold their tongues, his cattle will tell the tale ;
and his dogs, and door-posts, and marble statues !
Close the shutters, cover all the chinks with tapestry, fasten the doors, remove every light from the chamber, 1 let each one keep his counsel, let not a soul lie near.
Yet what he does at the second cock-crow,2 the next tavern-keeper will know before dawn of day:
and will hear as well all the fabrications of his steward, cooks, and carvers.
3
For what charge do they scruple to concoct against their masters, as often as they revenge them­ selves for their strappings4 by the lies they forge?
Nor will there be wanting one to hunt you out against your will in the public thoroughfares, and pour his drunken tale into your miserable ears.
Therefore ask them what you just now begged of me !
They hold their tongues !
Why they would rather blaze abroad a secret than drink as much Falernian (all the sweeter because stolen) as Saufeia5 used to drink, when sacrificing6 for the people !
One should lead an upright life for very many reasons ;
but especially for this-that you may be able to despise your servants' tongues.
For bad as your slave may be, his tongue is the worst part about him.
Yet far worse still is he that places himself in the power of those whose body and soul he keeps together with his own bread and his own money.
7“
Well, the advice you have just given me to enable me to laugh to scorn my servants' tongues is very good, but too general.
Now, what do you advise in my particular case, after the loss of my time and the disappointment of my hopes.
For the short-lived bloom I and contracted span of a brief and wretched life is fast fleeting away!
While we are drinking,2 and calling for garlands, and perfumes, and women, old age steals on us unperceived !
Do not be alarmed !
So long as these seven hills stand fast you will never lack a pathic friend.
Those effeminates, who scratch their heads with one finger,3 will flock from all quarters to these hills, in carriages and ships.
You have still another and a better hope in store.
All you have to do is to chew eringo vigorously." " Tell this to luckier wights!
My Clotho and Lachesis are well content, if I can earn a subsistence by my vile labours.
Oh !
ye small Lares,4 that call me master, whom I supplicate with a fragment of frankincense, or meal, and a poor garland, when shall I secure 5 a sum that may insure my old age against the beggar's mat and crutch ?
Twenty thousand sesterces as interest, with good security for the principal ;
some small vessels of silver not enchased, but such as Fabricius,6 if cen­ sor, would condemn ;
and two sturdy Mœsian slaves,7 who, hearing me on their shoulders, might bid me stand without inconvenience in the noisy circus !
Let me have besides an engraver stooping over his work, and another who may with all speed paint2 me a row of portraits.
This is quite enough -since poor I ever shall be.
A poor, wretched wish in­ deed !
and yet I have no hope even of this !
For when dame Fortune3 is invoked for me, she stops her ears with wax fetched from that ship which escaped the Sirens' songs with its deaf rower.
IN all the regions which extend from Gades 4 even to the farthest east and Ganges, there are but few that can discrimin­ ate between real blessings and those that are widely different, all the mist 5 of error being removed.
For what is there that we either fear or wish for, as reason would direct ?
What is there that you enter on under such favourable auspices, that you do not repent of your undertaking, and the accomplish- ment of your wish ?
The too easy gods have overthrown1 whole families by granting their owners' prayers.
Our prayers are put up for what will injure us in peace, and injure us in war.
To many the copious fluency2 of speech, and their very eloquence, is fatal.
It was owing to his strength3 and won­ drous muscle, in which he placed his trust, that the Athlete met his death.
But money heaped up with overwhelming care, and a revenue surpassing all common patrimonies as much as the whale of Britain 4 exceeds dolphins, causes more to be strangled.
Therefore it was, that in that reign of Ter­ ror, and at Nero's bidding, a whole cohort5 blockaded Longi­ nus 6 and the spacious gardens of the over-wealthy Seneca, 7 and laid siege to the splendid8 mansion of the Laterani.9
It is but rarely that the soldier pays his visit to a garret.
Though you are conveying ever so few vessels of unembossed silver, entering on your journey by night, you will dread the ban­ dit's knife and bludgeon, and tremble at the shadow of a reed as it quivers in the moonshine.
1
The traveller with empty2 pockets will sing even in the robber's face.
The prayers that are generally the first put up and best known in all the temples are, that riches,3 that wealth may in­ crease ;
that our chest may be the largest in the whole forum.
4
But no aconite is drunk from earthenware.
It is time to dread it when you quaff jewelled cups,5 and the ruddy Setine blazes in the broad gold.
And do you not, then, now com­ mend the fact, that of the two sages,6 one used to laugh 7 when­ ever he had advanced a single step from his threshold;
the other, with sentiments directly contrary, used to weep.
But easy enough to any one is the stern 'censure of a sneering laugh :
the wonder is how the other's eyes could ever have a sufficient supply of tears.
8
Democritus used to shake his sides with perpetual laughter, though in the cities of those regions there were, no prætextae, no trabeæ,1 no fasces, no litter, no tribunal !
What, had he seen the prætor 2 standing pre-eminent in his lofty car, and raised on high in the mid dust of the cir­ cus, dressed in the tunic of Jove, and wearing on his shoulders the Tyrian hangings of the embroidered toga;
and the circlet of a ponderous crown,3 so heavy that no single neck could en­ dure the weight:
4 since the official, all in a sweat, supports it, and, that the consul may not be too elated, the slave rides in the same car.
Then, add the bird that rises from his ivory sceptre:
on one side the trumpeters;
on the other, the long train of.
attendant clients, that march before him, and the;
Quirites, all in white togas, walking by his horses' heads men whose friendship he has won by the sportula buried deep in his chest.
Even in those days he found subject for ridicule in every place where human beings meet, whose wisdom proves that men of the highest intellect, men that will furnish noble examples, may be born in the country of wether-sheep, and in a foggy5 atmosphere.
He used to laugh at the cares and also the joys of the common herd;
sometimes even at their tears:
while he himself would bid Fortune, when she frowned, " Go hang ! ” and point at her his finger1 in scorn !
Superfluous therefore, or else destructive, are all those objects of our prayers, for which we think it right to cover the knees of the gods with waxen tablets 2Power, exposed to great envy, hurls some headlong down to ruin.
The long and splendid list of their titles and honours sinks 3 into the dust.
Down come their statues,4 and are dragged along with ropes:
then the very wheels of the chariot are smashed by the vigorous stroke of the axe, and the legs of the innocent 5 horses are demolished.
Now the fires roar!
Now that head, once worshipped by the mob, glows with the bellows and the furnace!
Great Sejanus crackles!
Then from that head, second only in the whole wide world, are made pitchers, basons, frying-pans,7 and plat­ ters ! "
Crown your doors with bays!
8 Lead to Jove's Capi­ tol a huge and milk-white ox!
Sejanus is being dragged along by the hook!
a glorious sight !”
Every body is de­ lighted.
"What lips he had !
and what a face!
If you believe me, I never could endure this man !” " But what was the charge under which he fell ?.
Who was the accuser ?
what the information laid ?
By whose witness did he prove it?"
"Nothing of the sort!
a wordy and lengthy epistle came from Capreæ.” " That's enough !
I ask no further.
But how does the mob of Remus behave ? ” “ Why, follow For­ tune,' as mobs always do, and hate him that is condemned!”
'That self-same people, had Tuscan Nurscia 2 smiled propitious on her country man,—had the old age of the emperor been crushed while he thought all secure,-would in that very hour have saluted Sejanus as Augustus.
Long ago they have thrown overboard all anxiety.
For that sovereign people that once gave away military command, consulships, legions, and every thing, now bridles it desires, and limits its anxious longings to two things only,-bread, and the games of the cir­ cus ! " I hear that many are involved in his fall.” " No doubt:
the little furnace3 is a capacious one;
I met my friend Bru­ tidius4 at the altar of Mars looking a little pale ! " "
But I greatly fear that Ajax, being baffled, 5 will wreak fearful ven­ geance, as having been inadequately defended.
Let us rush headlong;
and, while he still lies on the river-bank, trample on Cæsar’s foe !
But take care that our slaves witness the act!
lest any of them should deny it, and drag his master to trial with a halter round his neck !"
Such were the convers- ations then about Sejanus ;
such the smothered whispers of the populace
Would you then have the same court paid to you that Sejanus had?
possess as much, bestow on one the highest curule honours, give another the command of armies,' be esteemed the lawful guardian ?
of the prince that lounged away3 his days with his herd of Chaldæan astrologers, in the rock of Caprere that he made his palace ?
4
Would you have centuries and cohorts, and a picked body of cavalry,5 and præ­ torian bands at your beck ?
Why should you not covet these ?
Even those who have not the will to kill a man, would gladly have the power.
But what brilliant or prosperous fortune is of sufficient worth that your measure of evils should balance your good luck ?
Would you rather put on the prætexta of him that is being dragged along, or be the magistrate of Fidenæ or Gabii, and give sentence about false weights, 6 and break up scanty measures as the ragged ædile of the deserted Ulubræ ? 7
You acknowledge, therefore, that Sejanus did not know what ought to have been the object of his wishes.
For he that coveted excessive honours, and prayed for excessive wealth,, was but rearing up the multiplied stories of a tower raised on high, only that the fall might be the deeper,' and horrible the headlong descent of his ruin2 once accelerated !
VWhat overthrew the Crass! ?3 and Pompey and his sons ?4 and him that brought Rome's haughty citizens quailing5 be­ neath his lash ?
Surely it was the post of highest advance­ ment, reached by every possible device, and prayers for great­ ness heard by gods who showed their malignity in granting them !
Few kings go down without slaughter and wounds to Ceres' son-in-law.
Few tyrants die a bloodless death !
He that as yet pays court to6 Minerva, purchased by a single as, that is followed by his little slave7 to take charge of his diminutive satchel, begins to long, and longs through all his quinquatrian8 holidays, for the eloquence and the renown of Demosthenes or Cicero.
But it was through their elo­ quence that both of these orators perished :
the copious and overflowing fount of talent gave over each to destruction ;
by talent, was his hand and head cut off!

Cruel was the end that carried him off also whom Athens used to admire as.
his words flowed from his lips in a torrent3 of eloquence, and he swayed at will the passions of the crowded theatre.
With adverse gods and inauspicious fate was he born, whom his father, blear-eyed with the grime of the glowing mass, sent from the coal, and pincers,4 and the sword-forging anvil, and sooty Vulcan,5 to the rhetorician's school!
The spoils of war, the cuirass fastened to the truncated I trophy, the cheek-piece hanging from the battered helm, the car shorn of its pole, the streamer of the captured galley,2 and the sad'captive on the triumphal arch-top,3 are held to be goods exceeding all human blessings.
For these each gene­ ral, Roman, or Greek, or Barbarian, strains as his prize !
Full compensation for his dangers and his toils be sees in these!
So much greater is the thirst after fame than virtue.
For who would embrace4 virtue herself, if you took away the re­ wards of virtue ?
And yet, ere now, the glory of a few has been the ruin of their native land ;
that longing for renown, and those inscriptions that are to live on the marble that guards their ashes ;
and yet to burst asunder this, the mis­ chievous strength of the barren fig-tree has power enough.
Since even to sepulchres5 themselves are fates assigned.

To that soul, that once shook the very world's base, it is not sword, nor stone, nor javelin, that shall give the final stroke;

Men do believe that Athos was sailed through of yore;
and all the bold assertions that lying Greece hazards in history­ that the sea was bridged over by the same fleets, and formed into a solid pavement for the transit of wheels.
We believe that deep rivers failed, and streams were drunk dry5 when the Persian dined;
and all the flights of Sostratus'1 song, when his wings are moistened by the god of wine.
And yet, in what guise did he return after quitting Salamis, who, like a true barbarian as he was, used to vent his rage in scourges on Corns and Eurus, that had never suffered in this sort in AEolus' prison ;
and bound in gyves Ennosigæus2 himself.
It was, in faith, an act of clemency that he did not think he de­ served branding3 also.
Would any of the gods choose to serve such a man as this?
But how did he return ?
Why, in a single ship;
through waves dyed with blood, and with his galley retarded5 by the shoals of corpses.
Such was the penalty that glory, for which he had so often prayed, exacted."
Grant length of life, great Jove, and many years ! "
This is your only prayer in health and sickness.
But with what unremitting and grievous ills is old age crowded!
First of all, its face is hideous, loathsome, and altered from its former self;
instead of skin a hideous hide and flaccid cheeks;
and see!
such wrinkles, as, where Tabraca6 extends her shady dells, the antiquated ape7 scratches on her wizened jowl!
There are many points of difference in the young:
this youth is handsomer than that;
and he again than a third:
one is far sturdier than another.
Old men's faces are all alike—limbs tottering and voice feeble, 1 a smooth bald pate, and the second childhood of a drivelling nose ;
the poor wretch must mumble his bread with toothless gums;
so'loathsome to his wife, his children, and even to himself, that he would excite the disgust even of the legacy-hunter Cossus !
His palate2 is grown dull;
his relish for his food and wine no more the same ;
the joys of love are long ago forgotten ;
and in spite of all efforts to reinvigorate them, all manly energies are hopelessly extinct.
Has this depraved and hoary lechery aught else to hope ?
Do we not look with just suspicion on the lust that covets the sin but lacks the power ?
4 f Now turn your eyes to the loss of another sense.
For what pleasure has he in a singer, however eminent a harper it may be ;
nay, even Seleucus himself;
or those whose habit it is to glitter in a cloak of gold ?5
What matters it in what part of the wide theatre he sits, who can scarcely hear the horn-blowers, and the general clang of trumpets ?
You must bawl out loud, before his ear can distinguish who it is his slave says has called, or tells him what o'clock it is.
6
Besides, the scanty blood that flows in his chillI body is warmed by fever only.
Diseases of every kind dance round him in full choir.
If you were to ask their names, I could sooner tell you how many lovers Hippia had ;
how many patients Themison2 kill­ ed in one autumn ;
how many allies Basilus plundered;
how many wards Hirrus defrauded ;
(how many lovers long Maura received in the day;
how many pupils Hamillus corrupts.
-I could sooner run through the list of villas owned by him now, beneath whose razor3 my stiff beard resounded when I was in my prime.
One is weak in the shoulder;
another in the loins;
another in the hip.
Another has lost both eyes, and envies the one-eyed.
Another's bloodless lips receive their food from others' fingers.,
He that was wont to relax his fea­ tures to a smile at the sight of his dinner, now only gapes4 like the young swallow, to whom the parent bird, herself fast­ ing,5 flies with full beak.
But worse than all debility of limb is that idiocy which recollects neither the names of his slaves, nor the face of the friend with whom he supped the evening before ;
not even those whom he begot and brought up !
For by a heartless will he disinherits them;
and all his- property is made over to Phiale :

Even though the powers of intellect retain their vigour, yet 'he must lead forth the funerals of his children;

and now begins to count his years on his right hand,4 and has drunk so often of the new-made wine.
I pray you, lend me your ear a little space;
and hear how sadly he himself complains of the decrees of fate, and too great powers of life, when -he watches the blazing beard of Antilochus5 in his bloom, and asks of every friend that stands near, why it is he lingers on to this day;
what crime he has committed to deserve so long a life!
Such, too, is Peleus' strain, when he mourns for Achilles prematurely snatched from him:
and that other, whose lot it was to grieve for the shipwrecked6 Ithacensian.
Priam would have joined the shade of Assaracus with Troy still standing, with high solemnities, with Hector and his brothers supporting his bier on their shoulders, amid the weep­ ing Troades, so that Cassandra would lead off the wail, and Polyxena7 with mantle rent, had he but died at any time but that, after that Paris had begun to build his audacious ships.
What then did length of days confer on him ?
He saw his all o'erthrown :
Asia laid low by flame and sword.
Then the poor tottering warrior 1 laid down his diadem and donned his arms, and fell before the altar of supreme Jove ;
like some old ox2 that yields his attenuated and miserable neck to his owner's knife, long ago scorned 3 by the ungrateful plough.
That was at all events the death of a human being :
but his wife who survived him barked fiercely from the jaws of a bitchyI hasten on to our own countrymen, and pass by the king of Pontus, and Crœsus,5 whom the eloquent voice of the right- judging Solon bade look at the closing scene 6 of a life how­ ever long.
Banishment, and the gaol, and the marshes of Minturnæ,7 and his bread begged in conquered Carthage, took their rise from this.
What could all nature, what could Rome, have produced more blest in the wide world than that citizen, had he breathed forth his soul8 glutted with spoils, while the captive train followed around his chariot, in all the pomp and circumstance of war, when he was about to alight from his Teutonic 9 car!
Campania,10 in her foresight for Pompey, had given him a fever he should have prayed for.
But the many cities and their public prayers prevailed.
Therefore his own malignant fortune and that of Rome pre­ served him only that conquered he should lose his head.
Lentulus' escaped this torment;
Cethegus paid not this pe­ nalty, but fell unmutilated ;
and Catiline lay with corpse entire.
The anxious mother, when she visits Venus' temple, prays for beauty for her boys with subdued whisper;
2 with louder voice for her girls, carrying her fond wishes3 even to the verge of trifling.
"
But why should you chide me ? " site says ;
“Latona4 delights in the beauty of Diana."
But, Lu­ cretia5 forbids a face like hers to be the subject of your prayers :
Virginia would gladly give hers to Rutila, and receive her wen in exchange.
But, a son possessed of exquisite person keeps his parents in a constant state of misery and alarm.
So rare is the union 6 of beauty with chastity.
Though the house, austere in virtue, and emulating the Sabines of old, may have handed down,7 like an inheritance, purity of morals, and bounteous Nature with benignant hand may give, besides, a chaste mind and a face glowing with modest blood, (for what greater boon can Nature bestow on a youth ?
Nature, more powerful than any guardian, or any watchful care !) still they are not allowed to attain to manhood.
For the villany of the corrupter, prodigal in its guilt, dares to assail with tempting offers the parents themselves.
So great is their confidence in the success of bribes!
No tyrant in his cruel palace ever castrated a youth that was deformed ;
nor did even Nero carry off a stripling if club-footed, or disfigured by wens, pot-bellied, or hump-backed !
Go then, and exult in the beauty of your darling boy!
Yet for whom are there greater perils in store ?
He will become the adulterer of the city, and dread all the punishments1 that angry husbands inflict.
Nor will he be more lucky than the star of Mars, even though he never fall like Mars into the net.
2
But some­ times that bitter wrath exacts even more than any law per­ mits, to satisfy the husband's rage.
One despatches the adulterer with the sword ;
another cuts him in two with bloody lashes ;
some have the punishment of the mullet.
But your Endymion, forsooth, will of course become the lover of some lady of his affections!
But soon, when Servilia3 has bribed him, he will serve her whom he loves not, and will despoil her of all her ornaments.
For what will any woman refuse, to get her passions gratified ?
whether she be an Oppia, or a Catulla.
A depraved woman has all her morality4 con­ centered there).
“But what harm does beauty do one that is chaste ?"
Nay, what did his virtuous resolve avail Hippo­ lytus, or what Bellerophon ?
Surely she5 fired at the rejec­ tion of her suit, as though treated with indignity.
Nor did Sthenobæa burn less fiercely than the Cretan ;
and both lashed themselves into fury.
A woman is then most ruthless, when shame sets sharper spurs 6 to her hate.
Choose what course you think should be recommended him to whom Cæsar's wife1 purposes to marry herself.
This most noble and most beautiful of the patrician race is hurried off, poor wretched man, a sacrifice to the lewd eyes of Messalina.
She is long since seated with her bridal veil all ready :
the nuptial bed with Tyrian hangings is openly prepared in the gardens, and, according to the antique rites, a dowry of a million sesterces will be given ;
the soothsayer2 and the witnesses to the set­ tlement will be there !
Do you suppose these acts are kept secret ;
intrusted only to a few ?
She will not be married otherwise than with all legal forms.
Tell me which alterna­ tive you choose.
If you refuse to comply, you must die be­ fore night-fall.
3
If you do commit the crime, some brief delay will be afforded you, until the thing, known to the city and the people,4 shall reach the prince's ears.
He will be the last to learn the disgrace of his house!
Do you meanwhile obey her behests, if you set so high a value on a few days' existence.
Whichever you hold the better and the safer course, that white and beauteous neck must be presented5 to the sword!
Is there then nothing for which men shall pray ?
If you will take advice, you will allow the deities themselves to de­ termine what may be expedient for us, and suitable to our condition.
For instead of pleasant things, the gods will give us all that is most fitting.
Man is dearer to them than to himself-
We, led on by the impulse of our minds, by blind and headstrong passions, pray for wedlock, and issue by our wives ;
but it is known to them what our children will prove ;
of what character our wife will be !
Still, that you may have somewhat to pray for, and vow to their shrines the entrails and consecrated mincemeat1 of the white porker, your prayer must be that you may have a sound mind in a sound body.
Pray for a bold spirit, free from all dread of death ;
that reckons the closing scene of life among Nature's kindly boons ;
2 that can endure labour, whatever it be;
that knows not the­ passion of anger ;
that covets nothing ;
that deems the gnaw­ ing cares of Hercules,3 and all his cruel toils, far preferable to the joys of Venus, rich banquets, and the downy couch of Sardanapalus.
I show thee what thou canst confer upon thy­ self.
The only path that surely leads to a life of peace lies through virtue.
If we have wise foresight, thou, Fortune, hast no divinity..4
It is we that make thee a deity, and place thy throne in heaven !5IF
Atticus1 sups extravagantly, he is considered a splendid2 fellow:
if Rutilus does so, he is thought mad.
For what is received with louder laughter on the part of the mob, than Apicius,3 reduced to poverty ?
Every club,4 the baths, every knot of loungers, every theatre,5 is full of Rutilus.
For while his sturdy and youth­ ful limbs are fit to bear arms,6 and while he is hot in blood, he is driven7 (not indeed forced to it, but unchecked by the tribune) to copy out8 the instructions and imperial commands of the trainer of gladiators.
Moreover you see many whom their creditor, often cheated of his money, is wont to look out for at the very entrance of the market ;
9 and whose inducement to live exists in their palate alone.
The greatest wretch amongst these, one who must soon fail, since his ruin is already as clear1 as day, sups the more extravagantly and the more splendidly.
Meanwhile they ransack all the elements for dainties ;
2 the price never standing in the way of their grati­ fication.
If you look more closely into it, those please the more which are bought for more.
Therefore they have no scruple3 in borrowing a sum, soon to be squandered, by pawning4 their plate, or the broken5 image of their mother;
and, with the 4006 serterces, seasoning an earthen7 dish to tickle their palate.
Thus they are reduced to the hotchpotch8 of the gladiator.
It makes therefore all the difference, who it is that pro­ cures these same things.
For in Rutilus it is luxurious ex­ travagance.
In Ventidius it takes a praiseworthy name, and derives credit from his fortune.
I should with reason despise the man, who knows how much more lofty Atlas is than all the mountains in Libya, yet this very man knows not how much a little purse differs from an iron-bound chest.
1 “Know thyself," came down from heaven :
2 a proverb to be implanted and cherished in the memory, whether you are about to contract matrimony,3 or wish to be in a part of the sacred4 senate :
-( for not even Thersites5 is a candidate for the breastplate of Achilles:
in which Ulysses exhibited himself in a doubtful character :
6)— or whether you take upon yourself to defend a cause of great moment.
Consult your own powers ;
tell yourself who you are;
whether you are a powerful orator, or like a Curtius, or a Matho,7 mere spouters.
One must know one's own measure, and keep it in view, in the greatest and in most trifling matters ;
even when a fish is to be bought.
Do not long for a mullet,1 when you have only a gudgeon in your purse.
For what end awaits you, as your purse fails and your gluttony increases:
when your patri­ mony and whole fortune is squandered upon your belly, what can hold your money out at interest, your solid plate, your flocks, and lands ?
By such proprietors as these, last of all4 the ring is parted with, and Pollio5 begs with his finger bare.
It is not the premature funeral pile, or the grave, that is luxury's horror, but old age,G more to be dreaded than death itself.
These are most commonly the steps:
money, borrowed at Rome, is spent before the very owners' faces;
then when some trifling residue is left, and the lender of the money is growing pale, they give leg-bail7 and run to Baiæ and Ostia.
For now-a- days to quit the forum8 is not more discreditable to you than to remove to Esquiline from hot1 Suburra.
This is the only pain that they who flee their country feel, this their only sor­ row, to have lost the Circensian games2 for one year.
Not a drop of blood remains in their face;
few attempt to detain modesty, now become an object of ridicule and fleeing from the city.
You shall prove to-day by your own experience, Persicus, whether all these things, which are very fine to talk about, I do not practise in my life, in my moral conduct, and in reality:
but praise vegetables,4 while in secret I am a glutton:
in others' hearing bid my slave bring me water-gruel,5 but whisper “cheese-cakes in his ear.
For since you are my promised guest, you shall find me an Evander :
6 you shall come as the Tirynthian, or the guest, inferior indeed to him, and yet himself akin by blood to heaven :
the one sent to the skies by watery the other by fire.
Now hear your bill of fare,8 furnished by no public market.
9
From my farm at Tibur there shall come a little kid, the fat­ test and tenderest of the whole flock, ignorant of the taste of grass, that has never yet ventured to browse even on the low twigs of the willow-bed, and that has more milk than blood in his veins:
and asparagus' from the mountains, which my bailiff's wife, having laid down her spindle, gathered.
Some huge eggs besides, and still warm in their twisted hay, shall be served up, together with the hens themselves:
and grapes kept a portion of the year, just as they were when fresh upon the vines :
pears from Signia2 and Syria:
and, from the same basket, apples rivalling those of Picenum,3 and smelling quite fresh ;
that you need not be afraid of, since they have lost their autumnal moisture, which has been dried up by cold, and the dangers to be feared from their juice if crude.
This would in times gone by have been a luxurious supper for our senate.
Curius4 with his own hands used to cook over his little fire pot-herbs which he had gathered in his little gar­ den :
such herbs as now the foul digger in his heavy chain rejects with scorn, who remembers the flavour of the vile dainties1 of the reeking cook-shop.
It was the custom for­ merly to keep against festival days the flitches of the smoked swine, hanging from the wide-barred rack, and to set bacon as a birth-day treat before one's relations, with the addition of some fresh meat, if a sacrificial victim furnished any.
Some one of the kin, with the title of “Thrice consul," that had held command in camps, and discharged the dignity of dicta­ tor, used to go earlier2 than his wont to such a feast as this, bearing his spade over his shoulder from the mountain he had been digging on.
But when men trembled at the Fabii,3 and the stern Cato, and the Scauri and Fabricii;
4 and when, in fine, even his colleague stood in dread of the severe character of the strict Censor;
no one thought it was a matter of anxiety or serious concern what kind of tortoiseS floated in the wave of ocean, destined to form a splendid and noble couch for the Trojugenæ.
But with side devoid of ornament, and sofas of diminutive size, the brazen front displayed the mean head of an ass wearing a chaplet,6 at which the country lads laughed in wantonness.
The food then was in keeping with the master of the house and the furniture.
Then the soldier, uncivilized, and too ig­ norant7 to admire the arts of Greece, used to break up the drinking-cups, the work of some renowned artists, which he found in his share of the booty when cities were overthrown, that his horse might exult in trappings,1 and his embossed helmet might display to his enemy on the point of perishing, likenesses of the Romulean wild beast bidden to grow tame by the destiny of the empire, and the twin Quirini beneath the rock, and the naked image of the god coming down 2 with buckler and spear, and impending over him.
Whatever sil­ ver he possessed glittered on his arms3 alone.
In those days, then, they used to serve all their furmety in a dish of Tuscan earthenware :
which you may envy, if you are at all that way inclined.
4
The majesty of temples also was more evidently near5 to men, and a voice6 heard about midnight and through the midst of the city, when the Gauls were coming from the shore of ocean, and the gods discharged the functions of a prophet, warned us of these.
This was the care which Jupiter used to show for the af­ fairs of Latium, when made of earthenware,7 and as yet pro- faned by no gold.
Those days saw tables made of wood grown at home and from our native trees.'
To these uses was the timber applied, if the east wind had chanced to lay prostrate some old walnut-tree.
But now the rich have no satisfaction in their dinner, the turbot and the venison lose their flavour, perfumes and roses seem to lose their smell, unless the broad circumference of the table is supported by a huge mass of ivory, and a tall leopard with wide-gaping jaws, made of those tusks, which the gate of Syene2 transmits, and the active Moors, and the Indian of duskier hue than the Moors;
3 and which the huge beast has deposited in some Nabathæan4 glen, as now grown too weighty and burdensome to his head :
by this their appetite5 is whetted:
hence their stomach acquires its vigour.
For a leg of a table made only of silver is to them what an iron ring on their finger would be:
I therefore cau­ tiously avoid a proud guest, who compares me with himself, and looks with scorn on my paltry estate.
Consequently I do not possess a single ounce of ivory :
neither my chess-board I nor my men are of this material ;
nay, the very handles of my knives are of bone.
Yet my viands never become rank in flavour by these, nor does my pullet cut up the worse on that account.
Nor yet will you see a carver, to whom the whole carving-school2 ought to yield the palm, some pupil of the professor Trypherus, at whose house the hare, with the large sow's udders,3 and the wild-boar, and the roe-buck,4 and phea­ sants,5 and the huge flamingo,6 and the wild goat7 of Gætulia, all forming a most splendid supper, though made of elm, are carved with the blunted knife, and resounds through the whole Suburra.
My little fellow, who is a novice, and uneducated all his days, does not know how to take dexterously off a slice of roe, or the wing of a guinea-lien ;
8 only versed in the mys­ teries of carving the fragments of a small collop.
9
My slave, who is not gaily dressed, and only clad so as to protect him from cold, will hand you plebeian cups1 bought for a few pence.
He is no Phrygian or Lycian, or one pur­ chased from the slave-dealer 2 and at great price.
When you ask for any thing, ask in Latin.
They have all the same style of dress;
their hair close-crept and straight, and only combed to-day on account of company.
One is the son of a hardy shepherd, another of a neat-herd:
he sighs after his mother whom he has not seen for a long time, and pines for his hovel3 and his play-mate kids.
A lad of ingenuous face, and ingenu­ ous modesty;
such as those ought to be who are clothed in brilliant purple.
He shall hand you wine4 made on those very hills from which he himself comes, and under whose summit he has played:
for the country of the wine and the attendant is one and the same.
Gambling is disgraceful, and so is adultery, in men of mo­ derate means.
Yet when rich men commit all those abomina­ tions, they are called jovial, splendid fellows.
Our banquet to-day will furnish far different amusements.
The author of the Iliad5 shall be recited, and the verses of high-sounding Mars, that render the palm doubtful.
What matter is it with what voice such noble verses are read?
6
But now having put off all your cares, lay aside business, and allow yourself a pleasing respite, since you will have it in your power to be idle all day long.
Let there be no mention of money out at interest.
Nor if your wife is accustomed to go out at break of day and return at night, let her stir up your bile,' though you hold your tongue.
Divest yourself at once of all that annoys you, at my threshold.
Banish all thoughts of home and servants, and all that is broken and wasted2 by them­ especially forget ungrateful friends !
Meantime, the spectacles of the Megalesian towel3 grace the Idæan solemnity:
and, like one in a triumph, the prey of horses, the prætor, sits:
and, if I may say so without offence to the immense and overgrown crowd, the circus to-day encloses the whole of Rome:
4 and a din reaches my ears, from which I infer the success of the green faction.
5
For should it not win, you would see this city in mourning and amazement, as when the consuls were conquered in the dust6 of Cannæ.
Let young men be spectators of these, in whom shouting and bold betting, and sitting by a trim damsel, is becoming.
Let our skin,' which is wrinkled with age, imbibe the vernal sun and avoid the toga'd crowd.
Even now, though it wants a whole hour to the sixth, you may go to the bath with unblushing brow.
You could not do this for five successive days ;
because even of such a life as this there would be great weariness.
It is a more moderate use2 that enhances pleasures.
THIS day, Corvinus, is a more joyful one to me than even my own birth-day ;
3 in which the festal altar of turf4 awaits the animals promised to the gods.
To the queen of the gods we sacrifice a snow-white5 lamb:
a similar fleece shall be given to her that combated the Mauri- tanian Gorgon.'
But the victim reserved for Tarpeian Jupi­ ter, shakes, in his wantonness, his long-stretched2 rope, and brandishes his forehead.
Since he is a sturdy calf;
ripe for the temple and the altar, and ready to be sprinkled with wine;
ashamed any longer to drain his mother's3 teats, and butts the oaks with his sprouting horn.
4
Had I an ample fortune, and equal to my wishes, a bull fatter than Hispulla,5 and slow- paced from his very bulk, should be led to sacrifice, and one not fed in a neighbouring pasture ;
but his blood should flow, giving evidence of the rich pastures of Clitumnus,6 and with a neck that must be struck by a ministering priest of great strength, to do honour to the return of my friend who is still trembling, and has recently endured great horrors, and won­ ders to find himself safe.
For besides the dangers of the sea, and the stroke of the lightning which he escaped, thick darkness obscured the sky in one huge cloud, and a sudden thunder-bolt struck the yard-arms, while every one fancied he was struck by it, and at once, amazed, thought that no shipwreck could be com­ pared in horror with a ship on fire.
7
For all things hap- pen so, and with such horrors accompanying, when a storm arises in poetry.
1Now here follows another sort of danger.
Hear, and pity him a second time;
although the rest is all of the same de­ scription.
Yet it is a very dreadful part, and one well known to many, as full many a temple testifies with its votive picture.
(Who does not know that painters2 are maintained by Isis ?)
A similar fortune befell our friend Catullus also :
when the hold was half full of water, and when the waves heaved up each side alternately of the labouring ship, and the skill of the hoary pilot could render no service, he began to compound with the winds by throwing overboard, imitating the beaver who makes a eunuch of himself, hoping to get off by the sa­ crifice of his testicles ;
so well does he know their medicinal properties.
"
Throw overboard all that belongs to me, the whole of it!" cried Catullus, eager to throw over even his most beautiful things—a robe of purple fit even for luxurious Mæcenases, and others whose very fleece the quality of the generous pasture has tinged, moreover the exquisite water with its hidden properties, and the atmosphere of Bætica1 contributes to enhance its beauty.
He did not hesitate to cast overboard even his plate, salvers the workmanship of Parthenius, a bowl2 that would hold three gallons, and worthy of Pholus when thirsty, or even the wife of Fuscus.3
Add to these bascaudæ,4 and a thousand chargers, a quantity of embletic work, out of which the cunning purchaser of Olyn­ thus5 had drunk.
But what other man in these days, or in what quarter of theglobe,has the courage to prefer his life to his money, and his safety to his property?
Some men do not make fortunes for the sake of living, but, blinded by avarice, live for the sake of money-getting.
The greatest part even of necessaries is thrown overboard :
but not even do these sacrifices relieve the ship-then in the urgency of the peril, it came to such a pitch that he yielded his mast to the hatchet, and rights himself at last though in a crippled state.
Since this is the last resource in danger we apply, to make the ship lighter.
Go now, and commit your life to the mercy of the winds ;
trusting to a hewn plank, with but four digits1 between you and death, or seven at most, if the deal is of the thickest.
And then together with your provision-baskets and bread and wide-bellied flagon,2 look well that you lay in hatchets,3 to be brought into use in storms.
But when the sea subsided into calm, and the state of affairs was more propitious to the mariner, and his destiny prevailed over Eurus and the sea, when now the cheerful Parcæ draw kindlier tasks with benign hand, and spin white wool,4 and what wind there is, is not much stronger than a moderate breeze, the wretched bark, with a poor make-shift, ran be­ fore it, with the sailors' clothes spread out, and with its only sail that remained :
when now the south wind subsided, toge­ ther with the sun hope of life returned.
Then the tall peak beloved by lulus, and preferred as a home by him to Lavinium,5 his stepmother's seat, comes in sight;
to which the white sow6 gave its name-( an udder that excited the astonishment of the gladdened Phrygians)—illustrious from what had never been seen before, thirty paps.
At length he enters the molest built through the waters enclosed within them, and the Pharos of Tuscany, and the arms extending back, which jut out into the middle of the sea, and leave Italy far behind.
You would not bestow such admiration on the harbour which nature form­ ed :
but with damaged bark, the master steers for the inner smooth waters of the safe haven, which even a pinnace of Baiæ could cross;
and there with shaven crowns2 the sailors, now re­ lieved from anxiety, delight to recount their perils that form the subject of their prating.
Go then, boys, favouring with tongues and minds ;
3 and place garlands in the temples, and meal on the sacrificial knives, and decorate the soft hearths and green turf-altar.
I will follow shortly, and the sacrifice which is most important4 having been duly performed, I will then return home, where my little images, shining in frail wax, shall receive their slen­ der chaplets.
Here I will propitiate1 my own Jove, and offer incense to my hereditary Lares,2 and will display all colours of the violet.
All things are gay;
my gateway has set up long branches,3 and celebrates the festivities4 with lamps lighted in the morning.
Nor let these things be suspected by you, Corvinus.
Ca­ tullus, for whose safe return I erect so many altars, has three little heirs.
You may wait long enough for a man that would expend even a sick hen at the point of death for so unprofitable a friend.
But even this is too great an outlay.
Not even a quail will ever be sacrificed in behalf of one who is a father.
If rich Gallita5 and Paccius, who have no children, begin to feel the approach of fever, every temple-porch is covered with votive tablets,6 affixed according to due custom.
There are some who would even promise a hecatomb7 of oxen.
Since elephants are not to be bought here or in Latium, nor is there any where in our climate such a large beast generated ;
but;
fetched from the dusky nation, they are fed in the Rutu­ lian forests, and the field of Turnus, as the herd of Cæsar, prepared to serve no private individual, since their ancestors used to obey Tyrian Hannibal, and our own generals, 1 and the Molossian king, and to bear on their backs cohorts-no mean portion of the war—and a tower that went into battle.
It is no fault, consequently, of Novius, or of Ister Pacuvius,2 that that ivory is not led to the altars, and falls a sacred vic­ tim before the Lares of Gallita, worthy of such great gods, and those that court their favour !
One of these two fellows, if you would give him licence to perform the sacrifice, would vow the tallest or all the most beautiful persons among his flock of slaves, or place sacrificial fillets on his boys and the brows of his female slaves.
And if he has any Iphigenia3 at home of marriageable age.
he will offer her at the altars, though he cannot hope for the furtive substitution of the hind of the tragic poets.
I commend my fellow-citizen, and do not compare a thousand4 ships to a will:
for if the sick man shall escape Libitina,5 he will cancel his former will, en­ tangled in the meshes of the net,6 after a service so truly won­ derful :
and perhaps in one short line will give his all to Pacuvius as sole1 heir.
Proudly will he strut over his defeated rivals.
You see therefore what a great recompense the slaughtered Mycenian maid earns.
Long live Pacuvius, I pray, even to the full age of Nestor.
2
Let him own as much as ever Nero plundered,3 let him pile his gold mountains high, and let him love no one,4 and be loved by none.
EVERY act that is perpetrated, that will furnish a precedent for crime, is loathsome 5 even to the author himself.
This is the punishment that first lights upon him, that by the verdict 6 of his own breast no guilty man is acquitted;
though the corrupt influence of the prætor may have made his cause pre­ vail, by the urn 7 being tampered with.
What think you, Calvin us,1 is the opinion of all men touching the recent vil­ lany, and the charge you bring of breach of trust ?
But it is your good fortune not to have so slender an income, that the weight of a trifling loss can plunge you into ruin :
nor is what you are suffering from an unfrequent occurrence.
This is a case well known to many,-worn threadbare,—drawn from the middle of fortune's heap.
2
Let us, then, lay aside all excessive complaints.
A man's grief ought not to blaze forth beyond the proper bounds, nor exceed the loss sustained.
Whereas you can scarcely bear even the very least diminutive particle of misfortune, how­ ever trifling, boiling with rage in your very bowels because your friend does not restore to you the deposit he swore to return.
Can he be amazed at this, that has left threescore years behind him, born when Fonteius was consul?
3
Have you gained 4 nothing by such long experience of the world ?
Noble indeed are the precepts which philosophy, that triumphs over fortune, lays down in her books of sacred wisdom.
Yet we deem those happy too who, with daily life 5 for their instruct­ ress, have learnt to endure with patience the inconveniences of life, and not shake off the yoke.
6What day is there so holy that is not profaned by bringing to light theft, treachery, fraud-filthy lucre got by crime of every dye, and money won by stabbing or by poison ?
1
Since rare indeed are the good !
their number is scarce so many as the gates of Thebes,2 or the mouths of fertilizing Nile.
We are now passing through the ninth age of the world:
an era far worse than the days of Iron ;
for whose villany not even Nature herself can find a name, and has no metal 3 base enough to call it by.
Yet we call heaven and earth to witness, with a shout as loud as that with which the Sportula,4 that gives them tongues, makes his clients applaud Fæsidius as he pleads.
Tell me, thou man of many years, and yet more fit to bear the boss 5 of childhood, dost thou not know the charms that belong to another's money ?
Knowest thou not what a laugh thy simplicity would raise in the common herd, for expecting that no man should forswear himself, but should believe some deity is6 really present in the temples and at the altars red with blood ?
In days of old the aborigines perhaps used to live after this fashion:
before Saturn in his flight laid down his diadem, and adopted the rustic sickle :
in the days when Juno was a little maid;
and Jupiter as yet in a private 1 sta­ tion in the caves of Ida:
no banquettings of the celestials above the clouds, no Trojan boy or beauteous wife of Hercules as cup-bearer;
or Vulcan (but not till he had drained the nectar) wiping2 his arms begrimed with his forge in Lipara.
Then each godship dined alone ;
nor was the crowd of deities so great3 as it is now-a-days :
and the heavens, content with a few divinities, pressed on the wretched Atlas with less grievous weight.
No one had as yet received as his share the gloomy empire of the deep:
nor was there the grim4 Pluto with his Sicilian bride, nor Ixion's wheel, nor the Furies, nor Sisy­ phus' stone, nor the punishment of the black vulture,5 but the shades passed jocund days with no infernal king.
In that age villany was a prodigy !
They used to hold it as a heinous sin, that nought but death could expiate, if a young man had not risen up to pay honour to an old one,6 or a boy to one whose beard was grown ;
even though he himself gloated over more strawberries at home, or a bigger pile of acorns.
1So just a claim to deference had even four years' priority;
so much on a par with venerated old age was the first down of youth !
Now, if a friend should not deny the deposit2 in­ trusted to him, if he should give back the old leathern purse with all its rusty3 coin untouched, it is a prodigy of honesty, equivalent to a miracle,4 fit to be entered among the marvels in the Tuscan records,5 and that ought to be expiated by a lamb crowned for sacrifice.
6
If I see a man above the com­ mon herd, of real probity, I look upon him as a prodigy equal to a child born half man, half brute ;
7 or a shoal of fish turned up by the astonished8 plough ;
or a mule9 with foal!
in tre­ pidation as great as though the storm-cloud had rained stones ;
10 or a swarm of bees1 had settled in long cluster from some temple's top ;
as though a river bad flowed into the ocean with unnatural eddies,2 and rushing impetuous with a stream of milk.
Do you complain of being defrauded of ten sestertia by im­ pious fraud ?
What if another has lost in the same way two hundred, deposited without a witness !
3 and a third a still larger sum than that, such as the corner of his capacious strong-box could hardly contain !
So easy, and so natural is it to despise the gods above,4 that witness all, if no mortal man attest the same !
See with how bold a voice he denies it!
What unshaken firmness in the face be puts on !
He swears by the sun's rays, by the thunderbolts of Tarpeian Jove, the glaive of Mars, the darts of the prophet-god of Cirrha,5 by the arrows and quiver of the Virgin Huntress, and by thy trident, C Neptune, father of the Ægæan !
He adds the bow of Hercules, Minerva's spear, and all the weapons that the arsenals of heaven hold.
6
But if he be a father also, he says, " I am ready to eat my wretched son's head boiled, swimming in vinegar from Pharos."
7There are some who refer all things to the accidents of for­ tune,8 and believe the universe moves on with none to guide its course ;
while nature brings round the revolutions of days and years.
And therefore, without a tremor, are ready to lay their hands 1 on any altar.
Another does indeed dread that punishment will follow crime;
he thinks the gods do exist.
Still he perjures himself, and reasons thus with himself:
" Let Isis 2 pass whatever sentence she pleases upon my body, and strike my eyes with her angry Sistrum, provided only that when blind I may retain the money I disown.
Are consump­ tion, or ulcerous sores, or a leg shrivelled to half its bulk, such mighty matters !
If Ladas 3 be poor, let him not hesitate to wish for gout that waits on wealth, if he is not mad enough to re­ quire Anticyra4 or Archigenes.5
For what avails the honour of his nimble feet, or the hungry branch of Pisa's olive ?
All­ powerful though it be, that auger of the gods, yet surely it is slow-paced!
If, therefore, they set themselves to punish all the guilty, when will they come to me ?
Besides, I may per­ chance discover that the deity may be appeased by prayers !
It is not unusual with him to pardon1 such perjurics as these.
Many commit the same crimes with results widely different.
One man receives crucifixion2 as the reward of his villany;
another, a regal crown !
"Thus they harden their minds, agitated by terror inspired by some heinous crime.
Then, when you summon him to swear on the sacred shrine, he will go first!
3
Nay, he is quite ready to drag you there himself, and worry you to put him to this test.
For when a wicked cause is backed by impudence, it is believed by many to be the confidence 4 of innocence.
He acts as good a farce as the runaway slave, the buffoon in Ca­ tullus'5 Vision!
You poor wretch, cry out so as to exceed Stentor,6 or rather, as loudly as Gradivus7 in Homer;
" Hearest thou8 this, great Jove, and openest not thy lips, when thou oughtest surely to give vent to some word, even though formed of marble or of brass ?
Or, why then do we place on thy glowing altar the pious I frankincense from the wrapper undone, and the liver of a calf cut up, and the white caul of a hog ?2
As far as I see, there is no difference to be made between your image and the statue of Vagellius !
3Now listen to what consolation on the other hand he can offer, who has neither studied the Cynics, nor the doctrines of the Stoics, that differ from the Cynics only by a tunic,4 and pays no veneration to Epicurus,5 that delighted in the plants of his diminutive garden.
Let patients whose cases are des­ perate, be tended by more skilful physicians ;
you may trust your vein even to Philippus' apprentice.
If you can show me no act so heinous in the whole wide world, then, I hold my tongue ;
nor forbid you to beat your breast with your fists, nor thump your face with open palm.
For, since you really have sustained loss, your doors must be closed;
and money is bewailed with louder lamentations from the household, and with greater tumult,6 than deaths.
No one, in such a case, counterfeits sorrow;
or is content with merely stripping 7 down the top of his garment, and vexing his eyes for forced rheum.
1
The loss of money is deplored with genuine tears.
But if you see all the courts filled with similar complaints, if, after the deeds have been read ten times over, and each time in a different quarter,2 though their own hand-writing,3 and their principal signet-ring,4 that is kept so carefully in its ivory casket, convicts them, they call the signature a for­ gery and the deed not valid ;
do you think that you, my fine fellow, are to be placed without the common pale ?
What makes you the chick of a white hen, while we are a worthless brood, hatched from unlucky eggs ?
What you suffer is a trifle ;
a thing to be endured with moderate choler, if you but ) turn your eyes to crimes of blacker dye.
Compare with it the hired assassin, fires that originate from the sulphur of incendiaries,5 when your outer gate is the first part that catches fire.
Compare those who carry off the ancient tem­ ple's massive cups,6 incrusted with venerable rust-the gifts of nations ;
or, crowns7 deposited there by some king of an­ cient days.
If these are not to be had, there comes some sacrilegious wretch that strikes at meaner prey:
who will scrape the thigh of Hercules encased in gold, and Neptune's face itself, and strip off from Castor his leaf-gold.
Will he, forsooth, hesitate, that is wont to melt down whole the Thun- derer 1 himself?
Compare too the compounders and vend­ ers of poisons ;
2 or him that ought to be launched into the sea in an ox's hide,3 with whom the ape,4 herself innocent, is shut up, through her unlucky stars.
How small a portion is this of the crimes which Gallicus,5 the city's guardian, list­ ens to from break of day to the setting of the sun !
Would you study the morals of the human race, one house is quite enough.
Spend but a few days there, and when you come out thence, call yourself, if you dare, a miserable man !
Who is astonished at a goitred throat 6 on the Alps ?
or who, in Meroë, 7 at the mother's breast bigger than her chubby infant ?
Who is amazed at the German's 8 fierce grey eyes, or his flaxen hair with moistened ringlets twisted into horns ?
Simply because, in these cases, one and all are alike by na­ ture.
The pygmy 1 warrior in his puny panoply charges the swooping birds of Thrace, and the cloud that resounds with the clang of cranes.
Soon, no match for his foe, he is snatched away by the curved talons, and borne off through the sky by the fierce crane.
If you were to see this in our country, you would be convulsed with laughter:
but there, though battles of this kind are sights of every day, no one even smiles, where the whole regiment is not more than a foot high."
And is there, then, to be no punishment at all for this perjured wretch and his atrocious villany?
"Well, suppose him hurried away at once, loaded with dou­ ble irons, and put to death in any way our wrath dictates, (and what could revenge wish for more ?) still your loss re­ mains the same, your deposit will not be refunded ! "
But the least drop of blood from his mangled body will give me a consolation that might well be envied.
Revenge is a blessing, sweeter than life itself Yes !
so fools think, whose breasts you may see burning with anger for trivial causes, sometimes for none at all.
How small soever the occasion be, it is matter enough for their wrath.
Chrysippus 2 will not hold, the same language, nor the gentle spirit of Thales, or that old man that lived by sweet Hymettus'1 hill, who, even amid those cruel bonds, would not have given his accuser one drop of the hemlock 2 he received at his hands !
Philosophy, blest 3 power !
strips us by degrees of full many a vice and every error !
She is the first to teach us what is right.
Since revenge is ever the pleasure of a paltry spirit, a weak and abject mind !
Draw this conclusion at once from the fact, that no one delights in revenge more than a woman !
Yet, why should you deem those to have escaped scot-free whom their mind,4 laden with a sense of guilt, keeps in con­ stant terror, and lashes with a viewless thong ?
Conscience, as their tormentor, brandishing a scourge unseen by human eyes !
Nay !
awful indeed is their punishment, and far more terrible even than those which the sanguinary Cæditius5 in­ vents, or Rhadamanthus!
in bearing night and day in one's own breast a witness against one's self.
The Pythian priestess gave answer to a certain Spartan,6 that in time to come he should not go unpunished, because he hesitated as to retaining a deposit, and supporting his villany by an oath.
For he inquired what was the opinion of the deity;
and whether Apollo counselled him to the act.
He did restore it therefore:
but, through fear,1 not from principle.
And yet he proved that every word that issued from the shrine was worthy of the temple, and but too true:
being exterminated together with all his progeny and house, and, though derived from a wide-spreading clan, with all his kin !
Such is the penalty which the mere wish to sin incurs.
For he that meditates within his breast a crime that finds not even vent in words,2 has all the guilt of the act !
What then if he has achieved his purpose ?
A respiteless anxiety is his:
that ceases not, even at his hours of meals :
while his jaws are parched as though with fever, and the food he loathes swells3 between his teeth All wines4 the miserable wretch spits out:
old Alban wine, of high-prized antiquity, disgusts him.
Set better before him !
and thickly-crowding wrinkles furrow his brow, as though called forth by sour6 Falernian.
At night, if anxious care has granted him per­ chance a slumber however brief, and his limbs, that have been tossing over the whole bed, at length are at rest, immediately he sees in dreams the temple and the altar of the deity he has insulted;
and, what weighs upon his soul with especial ter­ rors,2 he sees thee!
Thy awful3 form, of more4 than human bulk, confounds the trembling wretch, and wrings confession 5 from him.
These are the men that tremble and grow pale at every light­ ning-flash :
and, when it thunders, 6 are half dead with terror at the very first rumbling7 of heaven ;
as though not by mere chance, or by the raging violence of winds, but in wrath and vengeance the fire-bolt lights8 upon the earth !9
That last storm wrought no ill!
Therefore the next is feared with heavier presage, as though but deferred by the brief respite of this calm.
Moreover, if they begin to suffer pain in the side, with wakeful fever, they believe the disease is sent to their bodies from the deity, in vengeance.
These they hold to be the stones and javelins of the gods !
They dare not vow the bleating sheep to the shrine, or promise even a cock's 1 comb to their Lares.
For what hope is vouchsafed to the guilty sick?
2 or what victim is not more worthy of life ?
The character of bad men is for the most part fickle and variable.
3
While they are engaged in the guilty act they have resolution enough, and to spare.
When their foul deeds are perpetrated, then at length they begin to feel what is right and wrong.
Yet Nature ever reverts to her depraved courses, fixed and immutable.
For who ever prescribed to himself a limit to his sins?
or ever recovered the blush 5 of ingenuous shame once banished from his brow now hardened ?
What mortal man is there whom you ever saw contented with a single crime ?
This false friend of ours will get his foot entangled in the noose, and endure the hook of the gloomy dungeon:
or some cragS in the Ægean Sea, or the rocks that swarm with exiles of rank.
You will exult in the bitter punishment of the hated name;
and at length with joy confess7 that no one of the gods is either deaf or a Tiresias.
8THERE are very many things, Fuscinus,1 that both deserve a bad name, and fix a lasting spot on a fortune otherwise splen­ did, which parents themselves point the way to, and inculcate upon their children.
If destructive gambling2 delights the sire, the heir while yet a child plays 3 too;
and shakes the self-same weapons in his own little dice-box.
Nor will that youth allow any of his kin to form better hopes of him who has learnt to peel truflles,4 to season a mushroom,5 and drown beccaficas6 swimming in the same sauce, his gourmand sire with his hoary gluttony7 showing him the way.
When his seventh8 year has past over the boy's head, and all his second teeth are not yet come, though you range a thousand bearded9 philosophers on one side of him, and as many on the other, still he will be ever longing to dine in sumptuous style, and not degenerate from his sire's luxurious kitchen.
Does Rutilus inculcate a merciful disposition and a cha­ racter indulgent to venial faults ?
does he hold that the souls and bodies of our slaves2 are formed of matter like our own and of similar elements ?
or does he not teach cruelty, that Rutilus, who delights in the harsh clang of stripes, and thinks no Siren's 3 song can equal the sound of whips ;
the Antiphates 4 and Polyphemus of his trembling household ?
Then is he happy indeed whenever the torturer5 is summoned, and some poor wretch is branded with the glowing iron for stealing a couple of towels !
What doctrine does he preach to his son that revels in the clank of chains, that feels a strange delight in branded slaves,6 and the country gaol ?
Do you expect that Larga's 7 daughter will not turn out an adulteress, who could not possibly repeat her mother's lovers so quickly, or string them together with such rapidity, as not to take breath thirty times at least ?
While yet a little maid she was her mother's confidante ;
now, at that mother's dictations she fills her own little tablets, and gives them to her mother's agents to bear to lovers of her own.
Such is Nature's law.
1
The examples of vice that we wit­ ness at home2 more surely and quickly corrupt us, when they insinuate themselves into our minds, under the sanction of those we revere.
Perhaps just one or two young men may spurn these practices, whose hearts the Titan has formed with kindlier art, and moulded out of better clay.
3
But their sire's footsteps, that they ought to shun, lead on all the rest, and the routine4 of inveterate depravity, that has been long before their eyes, attracts them on.
Therefore refrain5 from all that merits reprobation.
One powerful motive, at least, there is to this-lest our children copy our crimes.
For we are all of us too quick at learning to imitate base and depraved examples:
and you may find a Catiline in every people and under every sky ;
but no where a Brutus,6 or Brutus' uncle !
Let nothing shocking to eyes or ears approach those doors that close upon your child.
Away !
far, far away,7 the pander's wenches, and the songs of the parasite 8 that riots the livelong night!
The greatest reverence1is due to a child!
If you are contemplating a disgraceful act, despise not your child's tender years, but let your infant son act as a check upon your purpose of sinning.
For if, at some future time, he shall have done any thing to deserve the censor's 2 wrath, and show himself like you, not in person only and in face, but also the true son of your morals, and one who, by follow­ ing your footsteps, adds deeper guilt to your erimes—then, forsooth !
you will reprove and chastise him with clamorous bitterness, and then set about altering your will.
Yet how dare you assume the front severe, and licence of a parent's speech;
you, who yourself, though old, do worse than this;
and the exhausted eupping-glass4 is long ago looking out for your brainless head ?
If a friend is coming to pay you a visit, your whole house­ hold is in a bustle. "
Sweep the floor, display the pillars in all their brilliancy, let the dry spider come down with all her web;
let one clean5 the silver, another polish the embossed6 plate—" the master's voice thunders out, as he stands over the work, and brandishes his whip.
You are alarmed then, wretched man, lest your entrance­ hall, befouled by dogs, should offend the eye of your friend who is coming, or your corridor be spattered with mud ;
and yet one little slave could clean all this with half a bushel of saw-dust.
And yet, will you not bestir yourself that your own son may see your house immaculate and free from foul spot or crime ?
It deserves our gratitude that you have pre­ sented a citizen to your country and people, 1 if you take care that he prove useful to the state-of service to her lands;
useful in transacting the affairs both of war and peace.
For it will be a matter of the highest moment in what pursuits and moral discipline you train him.
The stork feeds her young on snakes2 and lizards which she has discovered in the trackless fields.
They too, when fledg­ ed, go in quest of the same animals.
The vulture, quitting the cattle and dogs and gibbets, hastens to her callow brood, and bears to them a portion of the carcass.
Therefore this is the food of the vulture too when grown up, and able to feed itself and build a nest in a tree of its own.
Whereas the ministers of Jove, I and birds of noble blood, hunt in the forest for the hare2 or kid.
Hence is derived the quarry for their nest:
hence too, when their progeny, now matured, have poised themselves on their own wings, when hunger pinches they swoop to that booty, which first they tasted when they broke the shell.
Centronius had a passion for building;
and now on the embayed shore of Caieta,3 now on the highest peak of Tibur,4 or on Prasneste's5 hills, he reared the tall roofs of his villas, of Grecian6 and far-fetched marbles;
surpassing the temple of Fortune7 and of Hercules as much as Po- sides1 the eunuch outvied our Capitol.
While, therefore, he is thus magnificently lodged, Centronius lessened his estate and impaired his wealth.
And yet the sum of the portion that he left was no mean one:
but all this his senseless son ran through by raising new mansions of marble more costly than his sire's.
Some whose lot it is to have a father that reveres sabbaths, worship nothing save clouds and the divinity of heaven ;
and think that flesh of swine, from which their sire abstained, differs in nought from that of man.
Soon, too, they submit to circumcision.
But, trained to look with scorn upon the laws of Rome, they study and observe and reverence all those Jewish statutes that Moses in his mystic volume handed down:
never to show the road except to one that worships the same sacred rites-to conduct to the spring they are in quest of, the circumcised2 alone.
But their father is to blame for this;
to whom each seventh3 day was a day of sloth, and kept aloof from all share of life's daily duties.
All other vices, however, young men copy of their own free choice.
Avarice is the only one that even against their will they are constrained to put in practice.
For this vice deceives men under the guise and semblance 1 of virtue.
Since it is grave in bearing-austere in look and dress.
And, with­ out doubt, the miser is praised as "a frugal2 character," "a sparing man," and one that knows how to guard his own,3 more securely than if the serpent of the Hesperides4 or of Pon­ tus had the keeping of them.
Besides, the multitude considers the man of whom we are speaking, a splendid carver5 of his own fortune.
Since it is by such artificers as these that estates are increased.
But still, increase they do by all means, fair or foul, and swell in bulk, from the ceaseless anvil and ever-glowing forge.
The father, therefore, considers misers as men of happy minds,6 since he admires wealth, and thinks no instance can be found of a poor man that is also happy:
and therefore ex­ horts his sons to follow the same track, and apply themselves earnestly to the doctrines of the same sect.
There are certain first elements 7 of all vices.
These he instils into them in re­ gular order, and constrains them to become adepts in the most paltry lucre.
Presently he inculcates an insatiable thirst for gain.
While he is famishing himself, he pinches his servants’8 stomachs with the scantiest allowance.
9
For he never endures to consume the whole of the blue fragments of mouldy1 bread, but saves, even in the middle of September,2 the mince3 of yesterday ;
4 and puts by till to-morrow's dinner the summer bean5 with a piece of stockfish and half a stinking shad :
6 and, after he has counted them, locks up the shreds of chopped leek.
7
A beggar from a bridge8 would decline an invitation to such a meal as this !
But to what end is money scraped to­ gether at the expense of such self-torture?
Since it is un­ doubted madness,9 palpable insanity, to live a beggar's life, simply that you may die rich.
Meanwhile, though the sack swells, full to the very brim, the love of money grows10 as fast as the money itself grows.
And he that has the less, the less he covets.
Therefore you are looking out for a second villa, since one estate is not enough for you, and it is your fancy to extend11 your terri- tories;
and your neighbour's corn-land seems to you more spacious and fertile than your own;
therefore you treat for the purchase of this too, with all its woods and its hill that whitens with its dense olive-grove.
But if their owner will not be prevailed upon to part with them at any price, then at night, your lean oxen and cattle with weary necks, half­ starved, will be turned into his corn-fields while still green, and not quit it for their own homes before the whole crop1 has found its way into their ruthless2 stomachs-so closely cropped that you would fancy it had been mown.
You could hardly tell how many have to complain of similar treatment, and how many estates wrongs like this have brought to the hammer. "
But what says the world ?
What the trumpet of slanderous fame ?—"" What harm does this do me ?”3 he says ;
“
I had rather have a lupin's pod, than that the whole village neighbourhood 4 should praise me, if I am at the same time to reap the scanty crops of a diminutive estate.
"You will then, forsooth, be free from all disease5 and all infirmity, and escape sorrow and care;
and a lengthened span of life will hereafter be your lot with happier destiny, if you individually own as much arable land as the whole Roman people used to plough under king Tatius.
And after that, to men broken down with years, that had seen the hard service of the Punic wars, and faced the fierce Pyrrhus and the Molossian swords, scarce two acres1 a man were bestowed at length as compensation for countless wounds.
Yet that re­ ward for all their blood and toil never appeared to any less than their deserts-or did their country's faith appear scant or thankless.
Such a little glebe as this used to satisfy the father himself and all his cottage troop:
where lay his preg­ nant wife, and four children played-one a little slavey the other three freeborn.
But for their grown-up brothers3 when they returned from the trench or furrow, there was another and more copious supper prepared, and the big pots smoked with vegetables.
Such a plot of ground in our days is not enough for a garden.
/It is from this source commonly arise the motives to crime.
Nor has any vice of the mind of man mingled more poisons or oftener dealt 1 the asassin's knife, than the fierce lust for wealth unlimited.
For he that covets to grow rich,2 would also grow rich speedily.
But what respect for laws, what fear or shame is ever found in the breast of the miser hasting to be rich ? "
Live contented with these cottages, my lads, and these hills of ours !"
So said, in days of yore, the Marsian and Hernican and Vestine sire—“
Let us earn our bread, suf­ ficient for our tables, with the plough.
Of this the rustic deities3 approve ;
by whose aid and intervention, since the boon of the kindly corn-blade, it is man's fortune to loathe the oaks he fed upon before.
Nought that is forbidden will he desire to do who is not ashamed of wearing the high country boots4 in frosty weather, and keeps off the east winds by in­ verted skins.
The foreign purple, unknown to us before, leads on to crime and impiety of every kind.
"Such were the precepts that these fine old fellows gave to their children !
But now, after the close of autumn, even at midnight5 the father with loud voice rouses his drowsy son :
— "
Come, boy !
get your tablets and write !
Come, wake up !
Draw indictments !
get up the rubricated statutes1 of our fathers—or else draw up a petition for a centurion's post.
But be sure Lælius observe your hair untouched by a comb, and your nostrils well covered with hair,2 and your good brawny shoulders.
Sack the Numidians' hovels,3 and the forts of the Brigantes,4 that your sixtieth year may bestow on you the eagle that will make you rich.
Or, if you shrink from enduring the long-protracted labours of the camp, and the sound of bugles and trumpets makes your heart faint, then buy something that you may dispose of for more than half as much again as it cost you ;
and never let disgust at any trade that must be banished beyond the other bank of Tiber, enter your head, nor think that any difference can be drawn be­ tween perfumes or leather.
The smell of gain is good5 from any thing whatever !
Let this sentiment of the poet be for ever on your tongue-worthy of the gods, and even great Jove himself!—‘
No one asks how you get it, but have it you must.'
This maxim old crones impress on boys before they can run alone.
This all girls learn before their A B C.
"Any parent whatever inculcating such lessons as these I would thus address:
Tell me, most empty-headed of men !
who bids you be in such a hurry ?
I engage your pupil shall better your instruction.
Don't be alarmed !
You will be out-done;
just as Ajax outstripped Telamon, and Achilles excelled Peleus.2 Spare their tender years !3
The bane of vice matured has not yet filled the marrow of their bones !
As soon as he begins to trim a beard, and apply the long ra­ zor's edge, he will be a false witness-will sell his perjuries at a trifling sum, laying his hand4 on Ceres' altar and foot.
Look upon your daughter-in-law as already buried, if she has entered your family with a dowry that must entail death on her.
1
With what a gripe will she be strangled in her sleep !
For all that you suppose must be gotten by sea and land, a shorter road2 will bestow on him !
Atrocious crime involves no labour ! "
I never recommended this," you will hereafter say, “nor counselled such an act."
Yet the cause and source of this depravity of heart rests at your doors;
for he that in­ culcated a love for great wealth, and by his sinister lessons trained up his sons to avarice,3 does give full licence, and gives the free rein 4 to the chariot's course ;
then if you try to check it, it cannot be restrained, but, laughing you to scorn, is hur­ ried on, and leaves even the goal far behind.
No one holds it enough to sin just so much as you allow him, but men grant themselves a more enlarged indulgence.
When you say to your son, "
The man is a fool that gives any thing to his friend,5 or relieves the burden6 of his neigh- bour’s poverty," you are, in fact, teaching him to rob and cheat, and get riches by any crime, of which as great a love exists in you as was that of their country in the breast of the Deciï,1 as much, if Greece speaks truth, as Menæceus2 loved Thebes !
in whose furrows3 legions with their bucklers spring from the serpent's teeth, and at once engage in horrid war, as though a trumpeter had arisen along with them.
Therefore you will see that fire4 of which you yourself supplied the sparks, raging far and wide, and spreading universal destruc­ tion.
Nor will you yourself escape, poor wretch !
but with loud roar the lion-pupil5 in his den will mangle his trem­ blin- master.
Your horoscope is well known to the astrologers.

Yes !
but it is a tedious business to wait for the slow-spinning7 distaffs.
You will be cut off long before your thread8 is spun out.

If you only become spectator at what risk to life the additions to fortune are procured, the ample store in the brass-bound3 chest, the gold to be deposited in watchful Castor's4 temple;

You may give up, therefore, the games of Flora,5 of Ceres, and of Cybele,7 such far superior sport is the real business of life !
Do bodies projected from the petaurum,l or they that come down the tight-rope, furnish better entertainment than you who take up your constant abode in your Corycian2 bark, ever to be tossed up and down by Corus and by Auster?
the desperate merchant of vile and stinking wares!
You, who delight in importing the rich3 raisin from the shores of ancient Crete, and wine-flasks,4—Jove’s own fellow-countrymen !
Yet he that plants his foot with hazardous tread, by that perilous barter earns his bread, and makes the rope ward off both cold and hunger.
You run your desperate risk, for a thousand talents and a hundred villas.
Behold the harbour !
the sea swarming with tall ships !
more than one half the world is now at sea.
Wherever the hope of gain invites, a fleet will come ;
nor only bound over the Carpathian and Gætulian seas, but leaving Calpe5 far behind, hear Phoebus hissing in the Herculean main.
A noble recompense indeed for all this toil !
that you return home thence with well-stretched purse ;
and exulting in your swelled money-bags,l brag of having seen Ocean's monsters,2 and young mermen !
A different madness distracts different minds.
One, while in his sister's arms, is terrified at the features and torches of the Eumenides.
3
Another, when he lashes the bull,4 believes it is Agamemnon or Ulysses roars.
What though he spare his tunic or his cloak, that man requires a keeper,5 who loads his ship with a cargo up to her very bulwarks, and has but a plank6 between himself and the wave.
While the motive cause to all this hardship and this fearful risk, is silver cut up into petty legends and minute portraits.
Clouds and light­ ning oppose his voyage.

It is but summer-lightning !

And lie, to whose covetous desires1 but lately not all the gold sufficed which Tagus or Pactolus3 rolls down in its ruddy sand, must now be content with a few rags to cover his na­ kedness, and a scanty morsel, while as a “ poor shipwrecked mariner" he begs for pence, and maintains himself by his painting of the stormyYet, what is earned by hardships great as these, involves still greater care and fear to keep.
Wretched, indeed, is the guardianship 5 of a large fortune.
Licinus,6 rolling in wealth, bids his whole regiment of slaves mount guard with leathern buckets7 all in rows;
in dread alarm for his amber, and his statues, and his Phrygian marble,1 and his ivory, and massive tortoise-shell.
The tub of the naked Cynic2 does not catch fire !
If you smash it, another home will be built by to-morrow, or else the same will stand, if soldered with a little lead.
Alexander felt, when he saw in that tub its great inhabitant, how much more really happy was he who coveted nothing, than he who aimed at gaining to himself the whole world;
doomed to suffer perils equivalent to the exploits he achieved.
Had we but foresight, thou, Fortune, wouldst have no divinity.

It is we that make thee a goddess !
Yet if any one were to consult me what proportion of income is suf­ ficient, I will tell you.
Just as much as thirst and hunger4 and cold require;
as much as satisfied you, Epicurus,5 in your little garden !
as much as the home of Socrates contained be­ fore.
Nature never gives one lesson, and philosophy another.

Were Ulysses to relate at supper such a deed as this to the amazed Alcinous, he would perhaps have excited the ridicule or anger of some, as a lying babbler.

Does he suppose the heads of the Phæacians so void2 of brains ?
”So might any one with reason have argued, who was not yet drunk,3 and had taken but a scanty draught4 of the po­ tent wine from the Corcyræan5 bowl;
for the Ithacan6 told his adventures alone, with none to attest his veracity.
We are about to relate events, wondrous indeed, but achieved only lately, while Junius7 was consul, above the walls of sultry Coptos.
8
We shall recount the crime of a whole people, deeds more atrocious than any tragedy could furnish.
For from the days of Pyrrha,1 though you turn over every tragic theme,2 in none is a whole people3 made the perpetrators of the guilt.
Hear, then, an instance which even in our own days ruthless barbarism4 produced.
There is an inveterate and long-standing grudge,5 a deathless hatred and a rankling wound that knows no cure, burning fiercely still between Ombos6 and Tentyra, two neighbouring peoples.
On both sides the principal rancour arises from the fact that each place hates its neighbour's gods,7 and believes those only ought to be held as deities which itself worships.
But at a festive period of one of these peoples, the chiefs and leaders of their enemies determined that the opportunity must be seized, to prevent their enjoying their day of mirth and cheerfulness, and the delights of a grand dinner, when their tables were spread near the temples and cross-ways, and the couch that knows not sleep, since occasionally even the seventh day's sun finds it still there, spread without intermission of either night or day.
1 Savage,2 in truth, is Egypt!
But in luxury, so far as I myself remarked, even the barbarous mob does not fall short of the infamous Canopus.
3Besides, victory is easily gained over men reeking4 with wine, stammering 5 and reeling.
On one side there was a crew of fellows dancing to a black piper;
perfumes, such as they were;
and flowers, and garlands in plenty round their brows.
On the other side was ranged fasting hate.
But, with minds inflamed, they begin first of all to give vent to railings1 in words.
This was the signal-blast2 of the fray.
Then with shouts from both sides, the conflict begins;
and in lieu of weapons,3 the unarmed hand rages.
Few cheeks were without a wound.
Scarcely one, if any, had a whole nose out of the whole line of combatants.
Now you might see, through all the hosts engaged, mutilated faces,4 features not to be recognised, bones showing ghastly beneath the lacerated cheek, fists dripping with blood from their ene­ mies' eyes.
But still the combatants themselves consider they are only in sport, and engaged in a childish5 encounter, be­ cause they do not trample any corpses under foot.
What, forsooth, is the object of so many thousands mixing in the fray, if no life is to be sacrificed ?
The attack therefore is more vigorous ;
and now with arms inclined along the ground they begin to hurl stones6 they have picked up—Sedition's7 own peculiar weapons.
Yet not such stones as Ajax8 or as Turnus9 hurled;
nor of the weight of that with which Tydides1 hit Æneas' thigh ;
but such as right hands far different to theirs, and produced in our age, have power to project.
For even in Homer's2 life-time men were beginning to degenerate.
Earth now gives birth to weak and puny mortals.
3
Therefore every god that looks down on them, sneers and hates them!
After this digression4 let us resume our story.
When they had been reinforced by subsidies, one of the parties is em­ boldened to draw the sword, and renew the battle with deadly­ aiming5 arrows.
Then they who inhabit Tentyra,6 bordering on the shady palms, press upon their foes, who all in rapid flight leave their backs exposed.
Here one of them, in excess of terror urging his headlong course, falls7 and is caught.
Forthwith the victorious crowd having cut him up into numberless bits and fragments, in order that one dead man might furnish a morsel for many, eat him completely up, having gnawed his very bones.
They neither cooked him in a seething cauldron, nor on a spit.
So wearisome' and tedious did they think it to wait for a fire, that they were even content with the carcass raw.
Yet at this we should rejoice, that they profaned not the deity of fire which Prometheus' stole from highest heaven and gave to earth.
I congratulate3 the ele­ ment!
and you too, I ween, are glad.
4
But he that could bear to chew a human corpse, never tasted a sweeter 5 morsel than this flesh.
For in a deed of such horrid atrocity, pause not to inquire or doubt whether it was the first maw alone that felt the horrid delight!
Nay!
he that came up last,6 when the whole body was now devoured, by drawing his fingers along the ground, got a taste of the blood !
The Vascones,7 as report says, protracted their lives by the use of such nutriment as this.
But the case is very different.
There we have the bitter hate of fortune !
the last extremity of war, the very climax of despair, the awful destitution1 of a long-protracted siege.
For the instance of such food of which we are now speaking, ought to call forth our pity.
2
Since it was only after they had exhausted herbs of all kinds,3 and every animal to which the gnawings of an empty stomach drove them, and while their enemies themselves commiserated their pale and emaciated features and wasted limbs, they in their ravenous famine tore in pieces others' limbs, ready to devour even their own !
What man, or what god even, would refuse his pardon to brave men4 suffering such fierce extrem­ ities ?
men, whom the very spirits of those whose bodies they fed on, could have forgiven !
The precepts of Zeno teach us a better lesson.
For he thinks that some things only, and not all, ought to be done to preserve life.

But whence could a Cantabrian learn the Stoics' doctrines ?
especially in the days of old Metellus.
Now the whole world has the Grecian and our Athens.
Eloquent Gaul 1 has taught the Britons2 to become plead­ ers;
and even Thule3 talks of hiring a rhetorician.
Yet that noble people whom we have mentioned, and their equal in courage and fidelity, their more than equal in calam­ ity, Saguntum,4 has some excuse to plead for such a deed as this !
Whereas Egypt is more barbarous even than the altar of Mæotis.
Since that Tauric5 inventress of the impious rite (if you hold as worthy of credit all that poets sing) only sa­ crifices men;
the victim has nothing further or worse to fear than the sacrificial knife.
But what calamity was it drove these to crime ?
What extremity of hunger, or hostile arms that bristled round their ramparts, that forced these to dare a prodigy of guilt so execrable ?
What greater enormity6 than this could they commit, when the land of Memphis was parched with drought to provoke the wrath7 of Nile when unwilling to rise?
Neither the formidable Cimbri, nor Britons, nor fierce Sarmatians or savage Agathyrsi, ever raged with such frantic brutality, as did this weak and worthless rabble, that wont to spread their puny sails in pinnaces of earthenware, 1 and ply the scanty paddles of their painted pottery-canoe.
You could not invent a punishment adequate to the guilt, or a torture bad enough for a people in whose breasts " anger " and " hunger " are convertible terms.
Nature confesses that she has bestowed on the human race hearts of softest mould, in that she has given us tears.
2
Of all our feeling this is the noblest part.
She bids us therefore bewail the misfortunes of a friend in distress, and the squalid appearance of one accused, or an orphan3 summoning to jus­ tice the guardian who has defrauded him.
Whose girl-like hair throws doubt4 upon the sex of those cheeks bedewed with tears !
It is at nature's dictate that we mourn when we meet the funeral of a virgin of marriageable years, or see an infant1 laid in the ground, too young for the funeral-pyre.
For what good man, who that is worthy of the mystic torch,2 such an one as Ceres' priest would have him be, ever deems the ills of others3 matter that concerns not himself?
This it is that distinguishes us from the brute herd.
And therefore we alone, endued with that venerable distinction of reason4 and a capacity for divine things, with an aptitude for the practice as well as the reception of all arts and sciences, have received, transmitted to us from heaven's high citadel,5 a moral sense, which brutes prone6 and stooping towards earth, are lacking in.
In the beginning of the world, the common Creator of all vouchsafed to them only the principle of vitality;
to us he gave souls7 also, that an instinct of affection recipro- cally shared, might urge us to seek for, and to give, assistance;
to unite in one people, those before widely-scattered;
1 to emerge from the ancient wood, and abandon the forests2 where our fathers dwelt;
to build houses, to join another's dwelling to our own homes, that the confidence mutually en­ gendered by a neighbour's threshold might add security3 to our slumbers ;
to cover with our arms a fellow-citizen4 when fallen or staggering from a ghastly wound;
to sound the battle- signal from a common clarion;
to be defended by the same ramparts, and closed in by the key of a common portal.
But now the unanimity5 of serpents is greater than ours.
The wild beast of similar genus spares his kindred 6 spots.

The tigress of India 8 maintains unbroken harmony with each tigress that ravens.
Bears, savage to others, are yet at peace among themselves.
But for man !1 he is not content with forging on the ruthless anvil the death-dealing steel!
While his progenitors, those primæval smiths, that wont to hammer out nought save rakes and hoes, and wearied out with mattocks and ploughshares, knew not the art of manufacturing swords.

Here we behold a people whose brutal passion is not glutted with simple mur­ der, but deem3 their fellows' breasts and arms and faces a kind of natural food.
What then would Pythagoras4 exclaim ;
whither would he o not flee, could he be witness in our days to such atrocities as these!

WHO could possibly enumerate, Gallus,1 all the advantages that attend military service when fortunate ?
For if I could but enter the camp with lucky omen, then may its gate wel­ come me, a timid and raw recruit, under the influence of some auspicious planet.
For one hour of benignant Fate is of more avail than even if Venus'2 self should give me a letter of recommendation to Mars, or his mother Juno, that delights in Samos' sandy shored
Let us treat, in the first place, of advantages in which all share;
of which not the least important is this, that no ci­ vilian4 must dare to strike you.
Nay, even though he be himself the party beaten,5 he must dissemble his wrath, and not dare to show the prætor 6 the teeth he has had knocked out, and the black bruises on his face with its livid swell­ ings, and all that is left of his eye, which the physician can give him no hopes of saving.
If he wish to get redress for this, a Bardiac1 judge is assigned him—the soldier's boot, and stalwart calves that throng the capacious benches of the camp, the old martial law and the precedent of Camillus2 being strictly observed, " that no soldier shall be sued outside the trenches, or at a distance from the standards.
"
Of course, where a soldier is concerned, the decision of the centurion will needs be most equitable ;
3 nor shall I lack my just revenge, provided only the ground of the complaint I lay be just and fair.
Yet the whole cohort is your sworn enemy;
and all the maniples, with wonderful unanimity, obstruct the course of justice.
Full well will they take care that the redress you get shall be more grievous than the injury itself.
It will be an act, therefore, worthy of even the long-tongued Vagellius' mulish heart,4 while you have still a pair of legs, to provoke the ire of so many buskins, so many thousand hob-nails !
5
For who can go so far from Rome ?
Besides, who will be such a Pylades as to venture beyond the rampart of the camp ?
So let us dry up our tears forthwith, and not trouble our friends, who will be sure to excuse themselves.
When the judge calls on you, "Produce your witness, "2 let the man, whoever he may be, that saw the cuffs, have the courage to stand forth and say, "I saw3 the act," and I will hold him worthy of the beard,4 and worthy of the long hair of our an­ cestors.
You could with greater ease suborn a false witness against a civilian,5 than one who would speak the truth against the fortune and the dignity of the man-at-arms.
'Now let us observe other prizes and other solid advantages of the military life.
If some rascally neighbour has defrauded me of a portion of the valley of my paternal fields, or en­ croached on my land and removed the consecrated stone from the boundary that separates our estates, that stone which my pulse has yearly1 honoured with the meal-cake derived from ancient days, or if my debtor persists in refusing repayment of the sum I lent him, asserting that the deed is invalid and the signature a forgery:
I shall have to wait a whole year occupied with the causes of the whole nation, before my case comes on.
But even then I must put up with a thousand tedi­ ous delays, a thousand difficulties.
So many times the benches only are prepared;
then, when the eloquent Cæditius2 is lay­ ing aside his cloak, and Fuscus must retire for a little, though all prepared, we must break up ;
and battle in the tediously­ protracted arena of the court.
But in the case of those who wear armour, and buckle on the belt, whatever time suits them is fixed for the hearing of their cause, nor is their fortune frittered away by the slow drag-chain 3 of the law.
Besides, it is only to soldiers that the privilege is granted, of making their wills while their fathers are still alive.
4
For it has been determined that all that has been earned by the hard toil of military service should not be incorporated with that sum of which the father holds the entire disposal.
And so it is, that while Coranus follows the standards and earns his daily pay, his father, though tottering on the edge of the grave, pays court to his son that he may make him his heir.
His duties regularly discharged procure the soldier ad­ vancement ;
and yield to every honest exertion1 its justly merited guerdon.
2
For doubtless it appears to be the interest of the general himself, that he that proves himself brave should also be most distinguished for good fortune, that all may glory in their trappings,3 all in their golden chains.

To such as these I recommend 4 the prætor's edict 5 in the morning, and after dinner—Callirhoe.
This Satire, as well as the tenth Satire of Juvenal, is based upon the Second Alcibiades of Plato, which it closely resembles in arrangement as well as sentiment.
The object is the same in all three;
to set before us the real opinion which all good and worthy men entertained, even in the days of Pagan blindness, of the manner and spirit in which the deity is to be approached by prayer and sacrifice, and holds up to reprobation and ridicule the grovelling and low-minded notions whieh the vulgar herd, besotted by ignorance and blinded by self-interest, hold on the subject.
While we admire the logical subtlety with which Plato leads us to a necessary acknowledgment of the justiee of his view, and the thoroughly practical philosophy by which Ju­ venal would divert men from indulging in prayers dictated by mere self- interest, we must allow Persius the high praise of having compressed the whole subject with a masterly hand into a few vivid and comprehensive sentences.
The Satire consists of three parts.
The first is merely an introduction to the subject.
Taking advantage of the custom prevalent among the Ro­ mans of offering prayers and victims, and receiving presents and con­ gratulatory addresses from their friends, on their birth-day, Persius sends a poetical present to his friend Plotius Macrinus, with some hints on the true nature of prayer.
He at the same time compliments him on his superiority to the mass of mankind, and especially to those of his own rank, in the view he took of the subject.
In the second part he exposes the vulgar errors and prejudices respecting prayer and sacrifice, and shows that prayers usually offered are wrong, 1st, as to their matter, and 2ndly, as to their manner :
that they originate in low and sordid views of self-interest and avarice, in ignorant supersti­ tion, or the cravings of an inordinate vanity.
At the same time he holds up to scorn the folly of those who offer up costly prayers, the fulfilment of which they themselves render impossible, by indulging in vicious and depraved habits, utterly incompatible with the requests they prefer.
Lastly, he explains the origin of these sordid and worse than useless prayers.
They arise from the impious and mistaken notions formed by men who, vainly imagining that the Deity is even such a one as them­ selves, endeavour to propitiate his favour in the same grovelling spirit, and with the same unworthy offerings with which they would bribe the good-will of one weak and depraved as themselves;
as though, in Plato's words, an ἐμπορικὴ, τὲΧνη had been established between themselves and heaven.
The whole concludes with a sublime passage, describing in language almost approaching the dignity of inspired wisdom, the state of heart and moral feeling necessary to insure a favourable answer to prayers preferred at the throne of heaven.
MARK this day, Macrinus, with a whiter stone,2 which, with auspicious omen, augments3 thy fleeting years.

Pour out the wine to thy Genius !1
Thou at least dost not with mercenary prayer ask for what thou couldst not intrust to the gods un­ less taken aside.
But a great proportion of our nobles will make libations with a silent censer.
It is not easy for every one to remove from the temples his murmur and low whispers, and live with undisguised prayers.

But in his inmost breast, and beneath his breath, he murmurs thus, “ Oh that my uncle would eva­ porate!

and oh that by Hercules' good favour a jar6 of silver would ring beneath my rake !
or, would that I could wipe out7 my ward, whose heels I tread on as next heir!

Then dandles2 him in her arms, and with suppliant prayer transports him either to the broad lands of Licinus 3 or the palaces of Crassus.

"Him may some king and queen covet as a son-in- law !
May maidens long to ravish him !
Whatever he treads on may it turn to roses ! "
But I do not trust prayers to a nursed Refuse her these requests, great Jove, even though she make them clothed in white !
6You ask vigour for your sinews,7 and a frame that will in­ sure old age.
Well, so be it.
But rich dishes and fat sausages prevent the gods from assenting to these prayers, and baffle Jove himself.
You are eager to amass a fortune, by sacrificing a bull;
and court Mercury's favour by his entrails. "
Grant that my household gods may make me lucky !
Grant me cattle, and increase to my flocks !
How can that be, poor wretch, while so many cauls of thy heifers melt in the flames ?
Yet still he strives to gain his point by means of entrails and rich cakes.

Were I to offer you 1 goblets of silver and presents embossed with rich gold,2 you would perspire with delight, and your heart, palpitating with joy in your left breast,3 would force even the tear-drops from your eyes.
And hence it is the idea enters4 your mind of covering the sacred faces of the gods with triumphal gold.

For amongst the Brazen brothers,6 let those be chief, and let their beards be of gold, who send dreams purged from gross humours.
Gold hath expelled the vases of Numa7 and Saturnian8 brass, and the vestal urns and the pottery of Tuscany.
Oh !
souls bowed down to earth !
and void of aught celes­ tial !
Of what avail is it to introduce into the temples of the gods these our modes of feeling, and estimate what is accept­ able to them by referring to our own accursed flesh.

This it is that has dissolved Cassia in the oil it pollutes.
This has dyed the fleece of Calabria2 with the vitiated purple.
To scrape the pearl from its shell, and from the crude ore to smelt out the veins of the -glowing mass ;
this carnal nature bids.
She sins in truth.
She sins.
Still from her vice gains some emolument.
Say ye, ye priests !
of what avail is gold in sacrifice ?
As much, forsooth, as the dolls which the maiden bestows on Venus !
Why do we not offer that to the gods which the blear-eyed progeny of great Messala cannot give even from his high-heaped charger.
Justice to god and man enshrined3 within the heart;
the inner chambers 4 of the soul free from pollution;
the breast imbued5 with generous honour.
Give me these to present at the temples, and I will make my suc­ cessful offering1 with a little meal.
2In this Satire, perhaps more than in any other, we detect Persius' predilec­ tion for the doctrines of the Stoics.
With them the summum bonum was "the sound mind in the sound body."
To attain which, man must ap­ ply himself to the cultivation of virtue, that is, to the study of philosophy.
He that does not, can aspire to neither.
Though unknown to himself, he is labouring under a mortal disease, and though he fancies he possesses a healthy intellect, he is the victim of as deep-seated and dangerous a de­ lusion as the recognised maniac.
The object of the Satire is to reclaim the idle and profligate young nobles of his day from their enervating and pernicious habits, by the illustration of these principles.
The opening scene of the Satire presents us with the bed-chamber where one of these young noblemen, accompanied by some other youths pro­ bably of inferior birth and station, is indulging in sleep many hours after the sun has risen upon the earth.
The entrance of the tutor, who is a pro­ fessor of the Stoical philosophy, disturbs their slumbers, and the confusion consequent upon his rebuke, and the thin disguise of their ill-assumed zeal, is graphically described.
After a passionate outburst of contempt at their paltry excuses, the tutor points out the irretrievable evils that will result from their allowing the golden hours of youth to pass by unim­ proved :
overthrows all objections which are raised as to their position in life, and competency of means rendering such vigorous application super- fluous ;
and in a passage of solemn warning, full of majesty and power, describes the unavailing remorse which will assuredly hereafter visit those who have so far quitted the rugged path that leads to virtue's heights, that all return is hopeless.
He then proceeds to describe the defects of his own education;
and the vices he fell into in consequence of these defects- vices however which were venial in himself, as those principles which would have taught him their folly were never inculcated in him.
Whereas those whom he addresses, from the greater care that has been bestowed on their early training, are without apology for their neglect of these pal­ pable duties.
Then, with great force and vigour, he briefly describes the proper pursuits of well-regulated minds ;
and looks down with contemptu­ ous scorn on the sneers with which vulgar ignorance would deride these truths, too transcendent for their gross comprehension to appreciate.
The Satire concludes very happily with the lively apologue of a glutton ;
who, in despite of all warning and friendly advice, perseveres even when his health is failing, in such vicious and unrestrained indulgence, that he falls at length a victim to his intemperance.
The application of the moral is simple.
The mind that is destitute of philosophical culture is hopelessly diseased, and the precepts of philosophy can alone effect a cure.
He that despises these, in vain pronounces himself to be of sound mind.
On the approach of any thing that can kindle the spark, his passions burst into flame ;
and in spite of his boasted sanity, urge him on to acts that would call forth the reprobation even of the maniac himself.
The whole Satire and its moral, as Gifford says, may be fitly summed up in the solemn in­ junction of a wiser man than the schools ever produced :
" Wisdom is the principal thing:
therefore get Wisdom."WHAT !
always thus !1
Already the bright morning is en­ tering the windows,2 and extending3 the narrow chinks with light.
We are snoring4 as much as would suffice to work off the potent Falernian,5 while the index 6 is touched by the fifth shadow of the gnomon.
See !
What are you about ?
The raging Dog-star1 is long since ripening the parched harvest, and all the flock is under the wide-spreading elm.
One of the fellow-students2 says, " Is it really so ?
Come hither, some one, quickly.
Is nobody coming !"
His vitreous bile3 is swelling.
He is bursting with rage :
so that you would fancy whole herds of Arcadia4 were braying.
Now his book, and the two­ coloured5 parchment cleared of the hair, and paper, and the knotty reed is taken in hand.
Then he complains that the ink, grown thick, clogs in his pen ;
then that the black sepia t vanishes altogether, if water is poured into it ;
then that the reed makes blots with the drops being diluted.
0 wretch !
and every day still more a wretch !
Are we come to such a pitch ?
Why do you not rather, like the tender ring-dove,2 or the sons of kings, call for minced pap, and fractiously refuse your nurse's lullaby !-Can I work with such a pen as this, then ?
Whom are you deceiving ?
Why reiterate these paltry shifts ?
The stake is your own !
You are leaking away,3 idiot!
You will become an object of contempt.
The ill-baked jar of half-prepared clay betrays by its ring its defect, and gives back a cracked sound.
You are now clay, moist and pliant:
4 even now you ought to be hastily moulded and fashioned uninter­ mittingly by the rapid wheel.
5
But, you will say, you have a fair competence from your hereditary estate ;
a pure and stain­ less salt-cellar.
6
Why should you fear ?
And you have a paten free from care, since it worships your household deities.
1
And is this enough ?
Is it then fitting you should puff out your lungs to bursting because you trace the thousandth in descent from a Tuscan stock;
2 or because robed in your trabea you salute the Censor, your own kinsman ?
Thy trappings to the people !
I know thee intimately, inside and out !
Are you not ashamed to live after the manner of the dissolute Natta ?3
But he is besotted by vicious indulgence;
the gross fat1 is incrusted round his heart:
he is free from moral guilt;
for he knows not what he is losing ;
and sunk in the very depth of vice, will never rise again to the surface of the wave.
O mighty father of the gods !
when once fell lust, imbued with raging venom, has fired their spirits, vouchsafe to punish fierce tyrants in no other way than this.
Let them see Virtue,2 and pine away at3 having forsaken her !
Did the brass of the Sicilian' bull give a deeper groan, or the sword2 suspended from the gilded ceiling over the purple-clad neck strike deeper terror, than if one should say to himself, " We are sinking, sinking headlong down," and in his inmost soul, poor wretch, grow pale at what even the wife of his bosom must not know ?
I remember when I was young I often used to touch 3 my eyes with oil, if I was unwilling to learn the noble words of the dying Cato;
4 that would win great applause from my senseless master, and which my father, sweating with anxiety, would listen to with the friends he had brought to hear me.
And naturally enough.
For the summit of my wishes was to know what the lucky sice would gain ;
how much the ruin­ ous ace5 would sweep off;
not to miss the neck of the narrow jar;
1 and that none more skilfully than I should lash the top with a whip.
Whereas you are not inexperienced in detecting the obli­ quity of moral deflections, and all that the philosophic porch,3 painted over with trowsered Medes, teaches;
over which the sleepless and close-shorn youth lucubrates, fed on husks and fattening polenta.
To thee, besides, the letter that divides the Samian branches,4 has pointed out the path that rises steeply on the right-hand track.
And are you snoring still ?
and does your drooping head, with muscles all relaxed, and jaws ready to split with gaping, nod off your yesterday's debauch ?
Is there indeed an object at which you aim, at which you bend your bow ?
Or are you following the crows, with potsherd and mud, careless whither your steps lead you, and living only for the moment?
When once the diseased skin begins to swell, you will see men asking in vain for hellebore.
Meet the disease on its way to attack you.
Of what avail is it to promise mountains of gold to Craterus ?
1 Learn, wretched men, and investigate the causes of things ;
-what we are,-what course of life we are born to run,-what rank is assigned to us,—how delicate the turning round2 the goal, and whence the starting-point,­ what limit must be set to money,-what it is right to wish for,-what uses the rough coin3 possesses,—how much you ought to bestow on your country and dear relations,-what man the Deity destined you to be, and in what portion of the human commonwealth your station is assigned.
Learn :
and be not envious because full many a jar grows rancid in his well-stored larder, for defending the fat Umbri­ ans,4 and pepper, and hams, the remembrances of his Marsian client;
or because the pilchard has not yet failed from the first jar.

Here some one of the rank brood of centurions may say, “I have philosophy enough to satisfy me.
I care not to be what Arcesilas was, and woe-begone Solons, with head awry1 and eyes fastened on the ground, while they mumble suppressed mutterings, or idiotic silence, or balance words on their lip pouting out, pondering over the dreams of some palsied dotard, 'that nothing can be generated from nothing ;
nothing can return to nothing.
'
—Is it this over which you grow pale ?
Is it this for which one should go without his dinner?"
At this the people laugh, and with wrinkling nose the brawny2 youth loudly re-echo the hearty peals of laughter.
“Examine me !
My breast palpitates unusually ;
and my breath heaves oppressedly from my fevered jaws:
examine me, pray !”
He that speaks thus to his physician, being or­ dered to keep quiet, when the third night has seen his veins flow with steady pulse, begs from some wealthier mansion some mellow Surrentine,3 in a flagon of moderate capacity, as lie is about to bathe.
" Ho !
my good fellow, you look pale !"
"It is nothing!" "
But have an eye to it, whatever it is !
Your sallow skin is insensibly rising." " Well, you look pale too !
worse than I!
Don't play the guardian to me !
I buried him long ago—you remain." " Go on !
I will hold my peace !”
So, bloated with feasting and with livid stomach he takes his bath, while his throat slowly exhales sulphureous malaria.
But shivering4 comes on over his cups, and shakes the steam­ ing beaker5 from his hands;
his teeth, grinning, rattle in his head;
then the rich dainties dribble from his flaccid lips.
Next follow the trumpets and funeral-torches ;
and at last this votary of pleasure, laid out on a lofty bier, and plastered over with thick unguents,' stretches out his rigid heels2 to the door.
Then, with head covered, the Quirites of yesterday3 support his bier."
Feel my pulse, you wretch !
put your hand on my breast.
There is no heat here !
touch the extremities of my feet and hands.
They are not cold !
"If money has haply met your eye,4 or the fair maiden of your neighbour has smiled sweetly on you, does your heart beat steadily ?
If hard cabbage has been served up to you in a cold dish, or flour shaken through the people's sieve,5 let me examine your jaws.
A putrid ulcer lurks in your tender mouth, which it would not be right to grate against with vul­ gar beet.
6
You grow cold, when pallid fear has roused the bristles on your limbs.
Now, when a torch is placed beneath, your blood begins to boil, and your eyes sparkle with anger ;
and you say and do what even Orestes7 himself, in his hour of madness, would swear to be proofs of madness.
Had Persius lived after instead of before Juvenal, we might have imagined that he had taken for the theme the noble lines in his eighth Satire, “Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se Crimen habet quanta Major qui peccat habetur." viii. 140.
“For still more public scandal Vice extends, As he is great and noble who offends.”—Dryden.
Or had he drawn from the fountains of inspired wisdom, that he had had in his eye a passage of still more solemn import:
" A sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places.
For mercy will soon pardon the meanest;
but mighty men shall be mightily tormented."
Wisdom vi.
5. Either of these passages might fairly serve as the argument of this Satire.
What, however, Persius really took as his model is the First Alcibiades of Plato, and the imitation of it is nearly as close as is that of the Second Al­ cibiades in the Second Satire.
And the subject of his criticism is no less a personage than Nero himself.
The close analogy between Nero and Alcibiades will be further alluded to in the notes.
We must remember that Nero was but seventeen years old when he was called to take the reins of government, and was but three years younger then Persius him­ self.
The Satire was probably written before Nero had entirely thrown off the mask;
at all events, before he had given the full evidence which he afterwards did of the savage ferocity and gross licentiousness of his true nature.
There was enough indeed for the stern Satirist to censure ;
but still a spark of something noble remaining, to kindle the hope that the reproof might work improvement.
In his First Satire he had ridiculed his pretensions to the name of Poet;
in this he exposes his inability as a Politician.
—The Satire naturally and readily divides itself into three parts.
In the first he ridicules the misplaced ambition of those who covet exalted station, and aspire to take the lead in state affairs, without possessing those qualifications of talent, education, and experience, which alone could fit them to take the helm of government;
and who hold that the adventitious privileges of high birth and ancient lineage can countervail the enervating effects of luxurious indolence and vicious self-indulgence.
The second division of the subject turns on the much-neglected duty of self-examina­ tion ;
and enforces the duty of uprightness and purity of conduct from the consideration, that while it is hopeless in all to escape the keen scrutiny that all men exercise in their neighbour's failings, while they are at the same time utterly blind to their own defects, yet that men of high rank and station must necessarily provoke the more searching criticism, in ex­ act proportion to the elevation of their position.
He points out also the policy of checking all tendency to satirize the weakness of others, to which Nero was greatly prone, and in fact had already aspired to the dignity of a writer of Satire;
as such sarcasm only draws down severer recrimination on ourselves.
In the third part he reverts to the original subject;
and urges upon the profligate nobles of the day the duty of rigid self-scrutiny, by reminding them of the true character of that worthless rabble, on whose sordid judgment and mercenary applause they ground their claims to ap­ probation.
This love of the “aura popularis” was Nero's besetting vice;
and none could doubt for whom the advice was meant.
Yet the allusions to Nero throughout the Satire, transparent as they must have been to his contemporaries, are so dexterously covered that Persius might easily have secured himself from all charge of personally attacking the emperor, under the plea that his sole object was a declamatory exercise in imitation of the Dialogue of Plato."
DOST thou wield the affairs of the state ?1—(Imagine the bearded2 master, whom the fell draught of hemlock3 took off, to be saying this:
)—Relying on what?
Speak, thou ward4 of great Pericles.
Has talent, forsooth, and precocious know­ ledge of the world, come before thy beard ?
Knowest thou what must be spoken, and what kept back ?
And, therefore, when the populace is boiling with excited passion, does your spirit move you to impose silence on the crowd by the majesty of your hand ?1 and what will you say then ? "
I think, Qui­ rites, this is not just!
That is bad !
This is the properer course !"
For you know how to weigh the justice of the case in the double scale of the doubtful balance.
You can discern the straight line when it lies between curves,2 or when the rule misleads by its distorted foot;
and you.
are competent to affix the Theta3 of condemnation to a defect.
Why do you not then (adorned in vain with outer skin4) cease to display your tail1 before the day to the fawning rab­ ble, more fit to swallow down undiluted Anticyras?

What is your chief good?
to have lived always on rich dishes;
and a skin made delicate by constant basking in the sun?

Stay:
this old woman would scarce give a different answer,—“ Go now !
I am son of Dinomache !”4 Puff your­ self up 1—“ I am beautiful."
Granted !
Still Baucis, though in tatters, has no worse philosophy, when she has cried her herbs5 to good purpose to some slovenly slave.
How is it, that not a man tries to descend into himself?
Not a man !
But our gaze is fixed on the wallet6 on the back in front of us!
You may ask, " Do you know Vectidius' farms !"
Whose ?
The rich fellow that cultivates more land at Cures than a kite7 can fly over !
Him do you mean ?
Him, born under the wrath of Heaven, and an inauspicious Genius, who whenever he fixes his yoke at the beaten cross-ways,1 fearing to scrape off the clay incrusted on the diminutive vessel, groans out, " May this be well!" and munching an onion in its hull, with some salt, and a dish of frumety, (his slaves applauding the while,) sups up the mothery dregs of vapid vinegar.
But if, well essenced, you lounge away your time and bask in the sun, there stands by you one, unkenned, to touch you with his elbow, and spit out his bitter detestation on your morals-on you, who by vile arts make your body delicate !
While you comb the perfumed hair2 on your cheeks, why are you closely shorn elsewhere ?
when, though five wrestlers pluck out the weeds, the rank fern will yield to no amount of toil."
We strike;
1 and in our turn expose our limbs to the arrows.
It is thus we live.
Thus we know it to be.
You have a secret wound, though the baldric hides it with its broad gold.
As you please!

“While the whole neighbourhood pronounces me to be su­ per-excellent, shall I not credit2 them ?
"If you grow pale, vile wretch, at the sight of money;
if you execute all that suggests itself to your lust;
if you cau­ tiously lash the forum with many a stroke,3 in vain you pre- sent to the rabble your thirsty1 ears.
Cast off from you that which you are not.
Let the cobbler2 bear off his presents.
Dwell with yourself,3 and you will know how short your household stuff is.
On this Satire, which is the longest and the best of all, Persius may be said to rest his claims to be considered a Philosopher and a Poet.
It may be compared with advantage with the Third Satire of the second book of Horace.
As the object in that is to defend what is called the Stoical para­ dox, " that none but the Philosopher is of sound mind," " Quern mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri Caecum agit, insallum Chrysippi porticus et grex Autumat:
" i. 43—45.
so here, Persius maintains that other dogma of the Stoics, " that none but the Philosopher is truly a free man."
Horace argues (in the person of a Stoic) that there can be but one path that leads in the right direction ;
all others must lead the traveller only further astray.
"
Unus utrique error sed variis illudit partibus:
" (ἐσθλοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἁπλῶς παντοδαπῶς δὲ κακοί.
Arist. Eth. II. vi. 4.)
So Persius argues, whatever are the varied pursuits of different minds, he that is under the influence of some overwhelming passion, can offer no claim to be accounted a free agent.
" Mille hominum species, et rerum discolor usus." (52.) In fact, if we substitute free­ dom " for " wisdom," the whole argument of the last part of the Satire may be expressed in the two lines of Horace :
" Quisquis Ambitione malâ aut argenti pallet amore Quisquis Luxuria tristive Superstitions
Aut alio mentis morbo calet:
" that man can neither be pronounced free or of sound mind.
The Satire consists of two parts;
the first serving as a Proëm to the other.
It is, in fact, the earnest expression of unbounded affection for his tutor and early friend Annæus Cornutus, from whom he had imbibed those principles of philosophy, which it is the object of the latter part of the Satire to elucidate.
After a few lines of ridicule at the hackneyed pro­ logues of the day, he puts into the mouth of Cornutus that just criticism of poetical composition which there is very little doubt Persius had in re­ ality derived from his master;
and in answer to this, he takes occasion to profess his sincere and deep-seated love and gratitude towards the pre­ ceptor, whose kind care had rescued him from the vicious courses to which a young and ardent temperament was leading him;
and whose sound judgment and dexterous management had weaned him from the tempta­ tions that assail the young, by making him his own companion in those studies which expanded his intellect while they rectified the obliquity (to use the Stoics' phrase) of his moral character.
Such mutual affection, he urges, could only exist between two persons whom something more than mere adventitious circumstances drew together;
and he therefore concludes that the same natal star must have presided over the horoscope of both.
He then proceeds to the main subject of the Satire, viz.
that all men should aim at attaining that freedom which can only result from that perfect " soundness of mind " which we have shown to be the summum bonum of the Stoics.
This real freedom no mere external or adventitious cir­ cumstances can bestow.
Dama, though freed at his master's behest, if he be the slave of passion, is as much a slave as if he had never felt the prae­ tor's rod.
Until he have really cast off, like the snake, the slough of his former vices, and become changed in heart and principles as he is in po­ litical standing, he is so far from being really free from bondage that he cannot rightly perform even the most trivial act of daily life.
True free­ dom consists in virtue alone;
but " Virtus est vitium fugere :
" and he who eradicates all other passions, but cherishes still one darling vice, has but changed his master.
The dictates of the passions that sway his breast are more imperious than those of the severest task-master.
Whether it be avarice, or luxury, or love, or ambition, or superstition, that is the domi­ nant principle, so long as he cannot shake himself free from the control of these, he is as much, as real a slave as the drudge that bears his master's strigil to the bath, or the dog that fancies he has burst his bonds while the long fragment of his broken chain still dangles from his neck.
The last few lines contain a dignified rebuke of the sneers which such pure senti­ ments as these would provoke in the coarse minds of some into whose hands these lines might fall;
perhaps, too, they may be meant as a gentle reproof of the sly irony in which the Epicurean Horace indulged, while professing to enunciate the Stoic doctrine, that none but the true Philosopher can be said to be of sound mind.
IT is the custom of poets to pray for a hundred voices, 1 and to wish for a hundred mouths and a hundred tongues for their verses;
2 whether the subject proposed be one to be mouthed3 by a grim-visaged 4 Tragœdian, or the wounds5 of a Parthian drawing his weapon from his groin.

What is the object of this ?
or what masses1 of robust song are you heaping up, so as to require the support of a hundred throats ?
Let those who are about to speak on grand subjects collect mists on Helicon ;
2 all those for whom the pot of Procne 3 or Thyestes shall boil, to be often supped on by the insipid Glycon.
4
You neither press forth the air from the panting bellows, while the mass is smelting in the furnace;
nor, hoarse with pent-up murmur, foolishly croak out something ponderous, nor strive to burst your swoln cheeks with puffing.
You adopt the language of the Toga,6 skilful at judicious combination, with moderate style, well rounded,7 clever at lashing depraved morals,8 and with well­ bred sportiveness to affix the mark of censure.
Draw from this source what you have to say;
and leave at Mycenæ the tables,.
with the head1 and feet, and study plebeian dinners.
PERSIUS.
For my part, I do not aim at this, that my page may be inflated with air-blown trifles, fit only to give weight2 to smoke.
We are talking apart from the crowd.
I am now, at the instigation of the Muse, giving you my heart to sift;
3 and delight in showing you, beloved friend, how large a por­ tion of my soul is yours, Cornutus!
Knock then, since thou knowest well how to detect what rings sound,4 and the gloz­ ings of a varnished5 tongue.
For this I would dare to pray for a hundred voices, that with guileless voice I may unfold how deeply I have fixed thee in my inmost breast;
and that my words may unseal for thee all that lies buried, too deep for words, in my secret heart.
When first the guardian purple left me, its timid charge,6 and my boss7 was hung up, an offering to the short-girt 8 Lares ;
when my companions were kind, and the white centre-fold 1 gave my eyes licence to rove with impunity over the whole Suburra ;
at the time when the path is doubtful, and error, ignorant of the purpose of life, makes anxious minds hesi­ tate between the branching cross-ways ;
—I placed myself under you.
You, Cornutus, cherished my tender years in your So­ cratic bosom.
Then your rule, dexterous in insinuating Itself being applied to me, straightened my perverted morals;
my mind was convinced by your reasoning and strove to yield subjection ;
and formed features skilfully moulded by your plastic thumb.
For I remember that many long nights I spent with you ;
and with you robbed our feasts of the first hours of night.
Our work was one.
We both alike arranged our hours of rest, and relaxed our serious studies with a frugal meal.
Doubt not, at least, this fact;
that both our days harmonize by some definite compact,3 and are derived from the self-same planet.
Either the Fate, tenacious of truth,4 suspended our natal hour in the equally-poised balance;
or else the Hour that presides over the faithful divides between the twins the harmonious destiny!
of us two:
and we alike correct the in­ fluence of malignant Saturn2 by Jupiter, auspicious to both.
At all events there is some star, I know not what, that blends my destiny with thine.
There are a thousand species of men ;
and equally diversi­ fied is the pursuit of objects.
Each has his own desire ;
nor do men live with one single wish.
One barters beneath an orient sun,3 wares of Italy for wrinkled pepper4 and grains of pale cumin.5
Another prefers, well-gorged, to heave in dewy6 sleep.
Another indulges in the Campus Martius.
An­ other is beggared by gambling.
Another riots in sensual7 pleasures.
But when the stony8 gout has crippled his joints, like the branches of an ancient beech,-then too late they mourn that their days have passed in gross licentiousness, their light has been the fitful marsh-fog;
and look back upon the life they have abandoned.

4 " To-morrow, the case will be just the same !"
What, do you grant me one day as so great a matter ? "
But when that other day has dawned, we have already spent yesterday's to-morrow.
For see, another to- morrow wears away our years, and will be always a little beyond you.
For though it is so near you, and under the self-same perch, you will in vain endeavour to overtake the felloe5 that revolves before you, since you are the hinder wheel, and on the second axle.

I may live as I please ;

On this the Stoic (his ear well purged3 with biting vinegar) says, " Your inference is faulty;
the rest I admit, but cancel ‘I may,' and ‘ as I please.'"“
Since I left the praetor's presence, made my own master by his rod,4 why may I not do whatever my inclination dic­ tates, save only what the rubric of Masurius5 interdicts ?

There are few points on which men practically differ more than on the question, What is the right use of riches ?
On this head there was as much diversity of opinion among the philosophers of old as in the present day.
Some maintaining that not only a virtuous, but also a happy life consisted in the absence of all those external aids that wealth can bestow ;
others as zealously arguing that a competency of means was absolutely necessary to the due performance of the higher social virtues.
The source of error in most men lies in their mistaking the means for the end ;
and the object of this Satire, which is the most original, and perhaps the most pleasing of the whole, is to point out how a proper employment of the for­ tune that falls to our lot may be made to forward the best interests of man.
—Persius begins with a warm encomium on the genius and learning of his friend Cæsius Bassus, the lyric poet;
especially complimenting him on his antiquarian knowledge, and versatility of talent:
and he then proceeds to show, by setting forth his own line of conduct, how true happiness may be attained by avoiding the extremes of sordid meanness on the one hand, and ostentatious prodigality on the other ;
by disregarding the suggestions of envy and the dictates of ambition.
A prompt and liberal regard to the necessities and distresses of others is then inculcated;
for this, coupled with the maintenance of such an establishment as our fortune warrants us in keeping up, is, to use the words of the poet, " to use wealth, not to abuse it."
He then proceeds with great severity and bitter sarcasm to expose the shallow artifices of those who attempt to disguise their sordid selfish­ ness under the specious pretence of a proper prudence, a reverence for the ancient simplicity and frugality of manners, and a proper regard for the interests of those who are to succeed to our inheritance.
The Satire con­ cludes with a lively and graphic conversation between Persius and his imaginary heir, in which he exposes the cupidity of those who are waiting for the deaths of men whom they expect to succeed;
and shows that the anxiety of these for the death of their friends, furnishes the strongest mo­ tive for a due indulgence in the good things of this life;
which it would be folly to hoard up merely to be squandered by the spendthrift, or feed the insatiable avarice of one whom even boundless wealth could never satisfy.
This Satire was probably written, as Gifford says, " while the poet was still in the flower of youth, possessed of an independent fortune, of estimable friends, dear connexions, and of a cultivated mind, under the consciousness of irrecoverable disease :
a situation in itself sufficiently af­ fecting, and which is rendered still more so, by the placid and even cheer­ ful spirit which pervades every part of the poem."

”THE occasion of the following Satire is generally known as " the expulsion of the philosophers from Rome by Domitian.”
As the same thing took place under Vespasian also, it becomes worth while to inquire who are the persons intended to be included under this designation;
and in what manner the fears of the two emperors could be so worked upon, as to pass a sweeping sentence of banish­ ment against persons apparently so helpless and so little formidable as the peaceful cultivators of philosophy.
It seems not improbable then that the fears both of Vespasian and Domitian were of a per­ sonal as well as of a political nature.
We find that in both cases the " Mathematici ” are coupled with the " Philosophi."
Now these persons were no more nor less than pretenders to the science of judicial astrology [cf. Juv. iii. 43 ;
vi. 562 ;
xiv. 248 ;
Suet. Cal. 57 ;
Tit. 9 ;
Otho, 4 ;
Gell. i. 9] ;
and to what an extent those who were believed to possess this knowledge were dreaded in those days of gross superstition, may be easily inferred by merely looking into Juvenal's sixth and Persius' fifth Satire.
Besides the baleful effects of incantations, which were sources of terror even in Horace's days, the mere possession by another of the nativity of a person whose death might be an object of desire to the bearer, was supposed, at the time of which we are now speaking, to be a sufficient ground of serious alarm.
We are not surprised therefore to find it recorded as an instance of great generosity on the part of Vespasian, that on one occasion he pardoned one Metius Pomposianus, although he was informed that he had in his possession a " Genesis Imperatoria;
" or that the possession of a similar document with regard to Domi­ tian cost the owner his life.
(Cf. Suet. Vesp. 14;
Domit. 10.)
With regard to the philosophers, it appears that the followers of the Stoic school were those against whom the edict was especially directed.
Not only did the tenets of this school inculcate that in­ dependence of thought and manners most directly at variance with the servility and submissiveness inseparable from a state of thraldom under a despot;
but the cultivation of this branch of philosophy was held to be nothing more than a specious cover for an attach­ ment to the freedom of speech and action enjoyed under the re­ publican form of government;
and philosophy was accounted only another name for revolution and rebellion.
'The story told of Demetrius the Cynic, in Dio, (Ixvi. 13,) and confirmed by Suetonius, (Vesp. c. 13,) illustrates this view of the subject.
(Cf. Tac. Hist. iv. 40.)
It appears to have been at the suggestion of Mucianus,2 that all philosophers, but especially the Stoics, were banished from Rome ;
and that the celebrated Muso­ nius Rufus was the only one who was suffered to remain.
This took place A. D. 74.
Sixteen years after this we find a decree of the senate passed to a similar effect.
Now, as philosophy may be studied equally well any where, there seems no reason why, if it were not in some way connected with their political creed, all these votaries of Stoicism should in the interim have taken up their abode at Rome.
And though, no doubt, the unoffending may have suf­ fered with the guilty, the history of the edict seems pretty plainly to show what particular doctrines of their philosophy were so ob­ noxious to Domitian.
Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio all agree in the cause assigned for the sentence :
viz. that Juuius Arulenus Rusticus and Herennius Senecio had been enthusiastic in their praises of Thrasea Pætus and Helvidius Priscus;
and that therefore " all phi­ losophers were removed from Rome." (" Cujus criminis occasione philosophos omnes Urbe Italiàque submovit."
Suet. Domit. 10. Cf. Tac. Agric. 2. Dio, lxvii. 13.)
But it was for their undisguised hatred of tyrants, and for no dogma of the schools, that the former of these was put to death by Nero, and the latter by Vespasian.
Both of them, as we know, celebrated with no ordinary festivities the birth-days of the Bruti (Juv. v. 36);
and Helvidius, even while prætor, went so far as to omit all titles of honour or distinction be­ fore the name of Vespasian.
(Suet. Vesp. 15.)
We must not therefore fall into the common error of supposing this " banish­ ment of philosophers " to have been a mere act of wanton, sense­ less tyranny, or of brutal ignorance.
Even by his enemies' show­ ing, the opening scenes of Domitian's life' are at direct variance with such an idea.
(Cf. ad Juv. vii. 1.) And though we regret to find that men like Epictetus and Dio of Prusa were included in the disastrous sentence, it is some relief to learn that Pliny the younger, though living at the time in the house of the philosopher Artemidorus, and the intimate friend of Senecio and six or seven others of the banished, to whom he supplied money, (a fact which, as he himself hints, could not but have been known to the emperor, as Pliny was prætor at the time,) yet escaped unscathed.
(Cf. Plin. iii. Ep. XI. vii. 19. Gell. xv. 11.)How far Sulpicia was connected with this movement, or whether she was involved in the same sentence which overwhelmed the others, we have now no means of ascertaining.
It is quite clear that all her sympathies were with the Greeks;
and the passage concerning Scipio and Cato (1. 45—50) leaves little doubt that her philosophical opinions were those of the Stoics.
She rivals Juvenal in her thorough hatred of Domitian ;
which may, perhaps, be partly also attributed to family reasons.
For we must remember that she belonged to the gens which produced Servius Sulpicius Galba ;
and, as we have noticed on many occasions with regard to Juvenal, an attachment to that emperor seems to go hand in hand with hatred of Otho and Domitian.
From the conclusion of the Satire, it is probable that her husband was not implicated.
The Sulpician gens produced many distinguished men ;
of whom we may mention the commissioner sent to Greece, and the con­ querors of the Samnites, of Sardinia, and of Pyrrhus, besides the notorious friend of Marius.
Of this illustrious stock she was no unworthy scion.
Martial1 bears the strongest testimony to the purity of her morals and the chastity of her life, as well as to her devoted conjugal affection;
which latter virtue she illustrated in a poem replete with the most lively, delicate, and virtuous sentiments;
and which, had not the licentiousness of the age been beyond such a cure, might have produced a deep moral effect on the peculiar vices which especially disgraced the æra of the Cæsars.
Her bus­ band's name was Calenus, who not improbably belonged to the Fufian gens,2 and with him she enjoyed fifteen years of the purest domestic felicity, as we learn from the Epigram addressed to him by Martial, in which, not without a tinge of envy, he congratulates Calenus on the possession of so inestimable a treasure.
Both Epi­ grams are exceedingly beautiful, and every reader of Martial will be only too ready to say, " 0 si sic omnia."
Of her other works we unfortunately do not possess a single fragment;
3 and even the solitary Satire which bears her name, was at one time, as Scaliger tells us, falsely attributed to Ausonius.
Very much of the Satire is corrupt.
Wernsdorf's seems, on the whole, the best approximation to a true reading;
and the Com­ mentary of Dousa is, as far as it goes, satisfactory.
The Satire opens with an Invocation of Calliope, the Mnse of Heroic poetry.
The dignity of the subject, which is in fact the undeserved sufferings of the good and great men whom Domitian's edict was ejecting from their homes, deserves a higher strain than is compatible with the more common- place, and therefore less powerful, invectives of Iambic metre.
The effect produced by such a measure is described as nothing less than forcing the civilized world to retrograde to a state of primeval barbarism.
The cause which has led to such a perversion of taste and degradation of intellect is then examined;
which arc shown to be the result of a long-protracted peace.
The old Roman valour which had raised the city to the proud position promised by the father of gods and men, had become gradually enervated and enfeebled, as it ceased to have an object on which to exercise itself.—
The stern and rigid virtue of the best period of the city's history, which had led her greatest men, even in the fierce struggles for existence against the rival republic, to appreciate and patronize the philosophy of Greece, the love of country and the ties of brotherhood which had been fostered by that “ rugged nurse Adversity," were now all buried in the corpse-like lethargy induced by the enervating influence of a lengthened peace.
-The Satire concludes with a bitter denunciation of coming vengeance against the tyrant;
and a prophetic anticipation of the lasting fame to be enjoyed by the poem.
GRANT me, 0 Muse,1 to tell my little tale in a few words, in those numbers in which thou art wont to celebrate2 heroes and arms !
For to thee I have retired;
with thee revising3 my secret plan.
4
For which reason, I neither trip on in the measure of Phalæcus,1 nor in Iambic2 trimeter;
nor in that metre which, halting with the same foot, learnt under its Clazomenæan guide boldly to give vent to its wrath.
All other things3 moreover, in short, my thousand sportive effusions;
and how I was the first that taught our Roman matrons to rival the Greeks, and to diversify their subject with wit un­ tried before, consistently1 with my purpose, I pass by;
and thee I invoke, in those points in which thou art chief of all, and, supreme in eloquence, art best skilled.
Descend2 at thy votary's prayer and hear !
Tell me, 0 Calliope, what is it the great3 father of the gods purposes to do ?
Does he revert to earth, and his father's age ;
and wrest from us in death the arts that once he gave;
and bid us, in silence, nay, bereft of reason too, just as when we arose in the primeval age,4 stoop again5 to acorns,6 and the pure stream ?
Or does he guard with friendly care all other lands and cities, but thrusts away7 the race of Ausonia, and the nurselings of Remus ?
8For, what must we suppose ?
There are two ways by which Rome reared aloft her mighty head.
Valour in war, and wisdom in peace.
But valour, practised1 at home and by civil warfare, passed over to the seas of Sicily and the citadels of Carthage, and swept away also all other empires and the whole world.
Then as the victor, who, left alone in the Grecian stadium, droops, and though with valour undaunted, feels his heart sink within him—just so the Roman race, when it had ceased from its struggles, and had bridled peace in lasting trammels ;
then, revising at home the laws and discoveries of the Greeks,2 ruled with policy and gentle influence3 all that had been won by sea and land as the prizes of war.
By this Rome stood-nor could she indeed have maintained her ground without these.
-Else with vain words4 and lying lips would Jupiter 5 have been proved to have said to his queen, " I have given them empire6 without limit!
"Therefore, now, he who sways the Roman state7 has com- manded all studies, and the philosophic name and race of men, to depart out of doors and quit the city.
What are we to do?
We left the Greeks and the cities of men,l that the Roman youth might be better instructed in these.
Now, just as the Gauls,2 abandoning their swords and scales, fled when Capitoline Camillus thrust them forth ;
so our aged men are said to be wandering forth,3 and like some deadly burden, themselves eradicating their own books.
Therefore the hero of Numantia and of Libya, Scipio, erred in that point, who grew wise under the training of his Rhodian4 master;
and that other band, fruitful in talent, in the second war;
5 amongst whom the divine apophthegm1 of Priscus Cato held it of such deep import to determine whether the Roman stock would better be upheld4 by prosperity or adversity.
-By ad­ versity, doubtless ;
for when the love of country urges them to defend5 themselves by arms, and their wife held prisoner together with their household gods, they combine6 just like wasps, (a bristling band, with weapons all unsheathed along their yellow bodies,) when their home and citadel is assailed.
But when care-dispelling peace has returned, forgetful of labour, commons and fathers together lie buried in lethargic sleep.
A long-protracted and destructive peace7 has therefore been the ruin of the sons of Romulus.

Thus our tale comes to a close.
Henceforth, kind Muse, without whom life is no pleasure to me, I pray thee warn them that, like the Lydian of yore, when Smyrna fell,9 so now also they may be ready to emigrate;
or else, in fine, whatever thou wishest.
This only I beseech thee, goddess !
Present not in a pleasing light to Calenus1 the walls of Rome and the Sabines.
Thus much I spake.
Then the goddess deigns to reply in few words, and begins :
—“

For we haunt the laurel groves of Numa,2 and the self-same springs, and, with Egeria for our companion,3 deride all vain essays.

Its destined fame awaits the grief that does thee honour.
Such is the promise of the Muses' choir, and of Apollo4 that presides over Rome."IF but little is known of the personal character and life of the other Satirists of Rome, it is unfortunately still more the case with Lucilius.
Although the research and industry of modern scholars have collected nearly a hundred passages from ancient writers where his name is mentioned, the information that can be gleaned from them with respect to the events of his life is very scanty indeed;
and even of these meagre statements, there is scarcely one that has not been called in question by one or more critics of later days.
It will be therefore, perhaps, the most satisfactory course to present in a continuous form the few facts we can gather respecting his personal history;
and to mention afterwards the doubts that have been thrown on these statements, and the attempts of recent editors to reconcile them with the accredited facts of history.
Caius Lucilius, then, was born, according to the testimony of S. Hieronymus, (in Euseb. Chron.,) B. c. 148, in the first year of the 158th Olympiad, and the 606th of the founding of the city, (Varronian Computation,) in the consulship of Spurius Posthumius Albinus and Lucius Calpurnius Piso.
There was a plebeian Lucilian gens, as well as a patrician, but it was to the latter that the family of the poet undoubtedly belonged.
Horace says of himself, (ii. Sat. i. 74,) " Quidquid sum ego, quamvis infra Lucili censum ingeniumque tamen me cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque Invidia."
Porphyrion, in his commentary on the passage, says, Lucilius was the great uncle of Pompey the Great;
Pompey's grandmother being the poet's sister.
But Acron says he was Pompey's grandfather.
Velleius Paterculus, (ii. 29,) on the other hand, says that Lucilia, the mother of Pompey, was daughter of the brother of Lucilius, and of senatorian family.
His birth-place was Suessa, now Sessa, capital of the Aurunci, in Campania;
hence Juvenal (Sat. i. 19) says, " Cur tamen hoc potius libeat decurrere campo, per quern magnus equos Auruncæ flexit alumnus, Si vacat et placidi rationem admittitis edam ;
" and Auso­ nius, (Ep. xv.,) " Rudes Camænas qui Suessæ prævenis.”
At the age of fifteen, B. C. 134, he accompanied his patron, L. Scipio Afri­ canus Æmilianus, to the Numantine war, where he is said to have served as eqnes.

Pat. ii. 9, 4. Here he met with Marius, now about in his twenty-third year, and the young Jugurtha ;
who were also serving under Africanus, and learning, as Velleius says, “ that art of war, which they were afterwards to employ against each other."
In the following year Numantia was taken and razed to the ground, and Lucilius returned with his patron to Rome, shortly after the sedition and death of Tiberius Gracchus;
and lived on terms of the most familiar friendship with him and C. Læ­ lius, until the death of Scipio, B. c. 129;
and even at that early age had already acquired the reputation of a distinguished Satirist.
According to Pighius, (in Tabulis,) he held the office of quæstor, B. c. 127, two years after Scipio's death, and the prætorship, a. c. 117.
Van Heusde is also of opinion that he acted as publicanus;
and from a passage in Cicero, (de Orat. ii. 70,) some suppose he kept large flocks of sheep on the Ager publicus.
Besides Africanus and Lælius, (with whose father-in-law Crassus, however, he was not on very good terms, vid. Cic. de Or. i. 16,) he is said to have enjoyed the friendship of the following distinguished men, Sp. Al­ binus, L. Ælius Stilo, Q. Vectius, Archelaus, P. Philocomus, Lælius Decimus, and Q. Granins Præco.
He had a violent quarrel with C. Cælius, for acquitting a man who had libelled him.
He is said to have lived under Velia, where the temple of Victory afterwards stood, in a house built at the public expense for the son of king Antiochus when hostage at Rome.
(Asc. Pedian. in Ciceron.
Orat. c. L. Pisonem, p. 13.)
He made a voyage to Sicily, but for what cause, or at what period of his life, is not stated.
His closing years were spent at Naples, whither he retired to avoid, as some think, the effects of the hatred of those whom his Satire had offended;
and here he died, B. C. 103, in his forty-sixth year, and was honoured, according to Eusebius, with a public funeral.
He had a faithful slave named Metrophanes, whose honesty and fidelity he rewarded by writing an epitaph for his tomb, quoted by Martial as an instance of antique and rugged style of writing, xi. Ep. 90. “ Carmina nulla probas molli quw limite currant, Sed quæ per salebras altaque saxa caduut:
Et tibi Mæonio res carmine major habetur Luceili Columella heic situ' Metrophaues."
The name of his mistress is said to have been Collyra, to whom the sixteenth book of his Satires was inscribed.
He wrote thirty books of Satires, of which the first twenty and the last are in Heroic metre.
The other nine in Iambics or Trochaics.
He is not to be confounded with a comic poet of the same name, mentioned by the Scholiast on Horace and by Fulgentius.
Such is the traditional, and for a long time currently-believed, story of Lucilius' life.
The greater accuracy, or greater scepticism, of modern scholars has called into question nearly every one of these meagre facts.
Even the method of spelling his name has been a subject of fierce controversy.
In the best manuscripts, especially those of Horace, Cicero, and Nonius Marcellus, the name of Lucilius is invariably spelt with one 1.
Yet in spite of this testimony, in order to square with some pre-conceived notions of orthography, the I was doubled by Hadrian Turnebe, Claude de Saumaise, Joseph Scaliger, Lambinus, Jos. Mercer, and Cortius.
The propriety, however, of omitting the second I has been fully established by an appeal to MSS.
and inscriptions ;
and to Varges and ElleDdt the credit is due of successfully restoring the correct mode of spelling.
(Cf. Rhenish Philolog.
Museum for 1835, and Ellendt on Cicero de Orat. iii. 43.)Again, his prænomen is by some stated to be Lucius;
whereas, not to mention others, Cicero and Quintilian always speak of him asCaius.
But far more serious doubts, and with great probability, have been cast upon the dates assigned by S. Hieronymus for his birth and death.
Bayle, in his Dictionary, was the first to suggest them ;
and they were taken up and urged with great zeal and learning by Van Heusde, (in his Studia Critica in C. Lucilium Poetam, 1842,) who accused Jerome of negligence and incorrectness in the dates he assigns to many other events:
e. g. the overthrow of Numantia, the deaths of Plautus, Horace, Catullus, Lucretius, and Livius the tragedian, and the birth of Messala Corvinus.
The charge against the chronographer has been repeated, and with some show of truth, by Ritschel in the Rhenish Museum, 1843.
Van Heusde's line of argument is simply this, that the dates of Hieron.
are inconsistent with what Horace and Velleius say of Lucilius, and with what the poet says of himself,-that it is absurd to suppose that a lad of fifteen could have served as an eques;
or that so young a person would have been admitted to such intimate familiarity with men like Scipio Africanus and Laelius ;
and that at the time of Scipio's death, when, as it is said, Lucilius had already gained a great reput­ ation as a Satirist, he could have been barely over nineteen years old;
that if be had died at the age of forty-six, Horace would not have applied to him the epithet " Senex,"—that the year of his birth must be therefore carried back at least six years, and his death assigned to a much later period, as he mentions the Leges Liciniæ and Calpurnia, passed some years after the time fixed by Hieron.
for his death at Naples.
In this view Milman coincides—"
Notwith­ standing the distinctness of this statement of S. Hieronymus, and the ingenuity with which many writers have attempted to explain it, it appears to me utterly irreconcilable with facts."
(Personæ Horatianæ, p. 178.)
Clinton also says,1 (F. H. ann. B. c. 103,) " The expression of Horace, Sat. II.
i. 34, by whom Lucilius is called ‘ Senex,' implies that he lived to a later period.
"Such are the principal objections to the common accounts.
Of those who hold their accuracy, and endeavour to explain away the difficulties attaching to them, the chief are Varges and Gerlach.
The principal points will be taken in the order in which they occur.
With regard to the first, Varges shows, in opposition to Bayle, that it was the custom for young Romans to serve long before the legal age, either voluntarily, that they might apply themselves sooner to civil matters, by getting over their period of military service ;
or compulsorily, to supply the waste of soldiers caused by the incessant wars in which Rome was engaged.
Hence the necessity for the law of C. Gracchus to prevent enlistment under the age of seventeen.
(νεώτερονἐτω̃ν ἐπτακαίδεκα μὴ καταλέγεσθαι στρατιώτην.) Cf. Liv. xxv. 5. Duk. ad Liv. xxvi. 25.
As the equestrian service was the more honourable, it was probably conceded to Lucilius on ac­ count of bis gentle birth and early promise.
Gerlach thinks that Tibullus2 was only thirteen when he accompanied M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus in his Aquitanian campaign.
Now Tibullus was only of squestrian family.
There is no difficulty therefore in supposing that Lucilius, who was of senatorian family, might have served as eques at the age of fifteen.
3
As to the fact of Scipio and Lælius admitting him to their inti­ mate friendship at so early an age, a parallel may be found in the case of Archias the poet.
Besides, Scipio and Lælius were the most likely men to discover and to foster the early talent of the young poet.
For the fact of the intimacy we have the testimony of Horace, Sat. II.
i. 71, " Quin ubi se a vulgo et scena in secreta remorant Virtus Scipiadæ et mitis sapientia Lælî Nugari cum illo et discincti ludere, donee Decoqueretur olus, soliti."
On which the commentator says, " That the three were on such in­ timate terms, that on one occasion Lælius was running round the sofas in the Triclinium, while Lucilius was chasing him with a twisted towel to hit him with."
This story agrees exactly with the description given by Cicero' (de Orat. ii.
6) of the conduct of Scipio and Lælius, who speaks of their retiring together to the country- house of the former, and to have descended, for the relaxation of their minds, to the most childish amusements, such as gathering shells on the shore of Caieta.
Who would be more likely than such men as these to be captivated by the precocious wit and pun­ gent sarcasm of a sprightly lad ?
Again, the character of Lucilius' compositions admits of eminence at an earlier period of life than the other branches of poetry.
And yet Catullus and Propertius, not to mention many others, attained great eminence as poets at a very early age ;
certainly long before their twentieth year.
The Satiric poetry of Lucilius depending more on a keen per­ ception of the ludicrous, and shrewd observation of passing events and the foibles of individuals, would more readily win approbation at an early age, than compositions whose excellence would consist in the display of judgment, knowledge of the world, and elaborate finish.
There is therefore no reason to suppose that his talent may not, like that of Cicero, have been developed at an early age, and having come under the notice, might have won the approbation, of men of such character in private life as Scipio and Lælius are re­ ported to have been.
But Horace calls him " senex," ii. Sat. 28, seq. " Ille (Lucilius) velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim Credebat libris :
neque si male cesserat, unquam Decurrens alio, neque si bene, quo fit ut omnis Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita Senis—"
To this it is answered :
nothing can be more loose and vague than the employment by Roman writers of terms relating to the different periods of human life :
e. g. " puer, adolescentulus, adolescens, juvenis, senex."
We have seen that Tibullus at the age of forty may be called "juvenis."
Hannibal, at the age of forty-four, (i. e. two years younger than Lucilius at his death,) calls himself senex.
(Cf. Liv. xxx. 30, compared with c. 28, and Crevier's note.)2 So Persius (Sat. i. 124) calls Aristophanes " prægrandis senex," though, as Ranke shows in his Life, (p. xc.,) he was not of great age.
We might add that Horace himself uses the phrase, " poetarum seni­ eram turba," (i. Sat. x. 67,) as equivalent to priorum.
In the fourth Fragment of the twentieth book, Lucilius mentions the Calpurnian Law. " Calpurnî sævam legem Pisoni' reprendi Eduxique animam in primoribu' naribus."
This Van Heusde holds to be the Lex Calpurnia, de ambitu, passed by C. Calpurnius Piso, when consul, A. U. c. 687, B. c. 67, at which time Lucilius would have been eighty-one years old.
But there was another Lex Calpurnia, de pecuniis repetundis, passed by L. Calpurnius Piso, tribune, in A. u. c. 604, n. c. 150.
Van Heusde says the former must be meant, because Lucilius applies to it the epithet sceva, and Cicero (pro Muræna, c. 46) also styles it "seve­ rissime scriptam."
He explains the second line of the Fragment to mean, that Lucilius " all but paid the penalty of death for his ani­ madversions of the law," but these words more correctly imply the fierce snorting of an angry man."
So Pers. Sat. v. 91, "Ira cadat naso."
Varro, R. R. ii. 3, 5, " Spiritum naribus ducere."
Mart. vi. Ep. 64, " Rabido nec perditus ore fumantem nasum vivi tentaveris ursi."
And any law whatever would be naturally termed "sæva" by him who came under the influence of it.
In the 132nd of the Fragmenta Incerta, we have (quoted from A. Cell. Noct. Att. ii. 24) these words, " Legem vitemus Licini."
The object of this law was to give greater sanction to the provisions of the Lex Fannia, a sumptuary law, which had become nearly obsolete.
If passed by P. Licinius Crassus Dives Lusitanicus, when consul, it must be referred to the year A. U. c. 657, B. c. 97, six years after the supposed date of Lucilius' death.
But there is no reason why this law should not have been passed by Licinius when tribune or præto?-, as well as when consul;
probably during his prætorship, as nearer the consulship, though Pighius, (Annal. iii. 122,) though without giving any authority, assigns it to his tri­ buneship.
The Orchian Law was passed by C. Orchius when tribune.
The Fannian and many other sumptuary laws were passed by prætors or tribunes.
The argument therefore derived from the law having been passed by Licinius, when consul, falls to the ground.
Allowing, however, that Lucilius was alive during the consul­ ship of Licinius, we have the incidental, and therefore more valua­ ble, testimony of Cicero that he must have died very shortly after.
In his " De Oratore," he introduces the speakers in the Dialogue quoting Lucilius, as one evidently not very recently dead.
Now this imaginary Dialogue is supposed to have taken place B. c. 91.
To the first book there is said to have been annexed an Epistle to L. AElius Stilo, the friend of the poet, to whom in all probability this book was dedicated.
(Fr. 16.)
We know from a note of Servius on the tenth book of the Æneid, (1. 104,) that the subject was a council of gods held to de­ liberate on the fortune of the Roman state ;
the result of the conference being, that nothing but the death of certain obnoxious individuals could possibly rescue the city from plunging headlong into ruin.
It is a kind of parody on the council of Celestials held in the first book of the Odyssey, to discuss the propriety of the return of Ulysses to Greece:
and as Homer represents Neptune, the great enemy of Ulysses, to have been absent from the meeting, so here (Fr. 2) we find an allusion to some previous council, at which Jupiter, by the machinations of Juno, (Fr. 15,) was not present.
Virgil, as Servius says, borrowed the idea of his discussion be­ tween Venus, Juno, and Jupiter, from this book;
only he translated the language of Lucilius into a type more suited to the dignity of Heroic verse.
Lucilius's council begin with discussing the affairs of mankind at large, and theu proceed to consider the best method of prolonging the Roman state, (Fr. 5,) which has no greater enemies than its own corrupt and licentious morals, and the wide-spreading evils of avarice and luxury.
But amidst the growing vices which undermined the state, must especially be reckoned the study of a spurious kind of philosophy, of rhetoric, and logic, which not only was the cause of universal indolence and neglect of all serious duties, but also led men to lay snares to entrap their neighbours.
(Fr. inc. 2.) A fair instance of these sophistical absurdities is given (Fr. inc. 12) ;
and the doctrine of the Stoics, to which Horace alludes, (i. Sat. iii. 124,) is also ridiculed.
(Fr. inc. 23.)
The pernicious effects of gold are then described, as destructive of all honesty, good faith, and every religious principle (Fr. inc. 39—47) ;
the result of which is, that the state is fast sinking into helpless ruin. (Fr. inc. 50.)
Nor are the evils of luxury less baleful.
(Fr. 19—21.)All this discussion, in the previous conference, had been nugatory on account of the absence of Jupiter, and the divisions that had arisen amongst the gods themselves.
In this debate Neptune had taken a very considerable part, since we hear that, discussing some very abstruse and difficult point, he said, it could not be cleared up, even though Orcus were to permit Carneades himself to revisit earth.
(Fr. 8.) Apollo also was probably one of the speakers, and expressed a particular dislike to his cognomen of " the Beautiful." (Fr. inc. 144.)
Perhaps all the gods but Jove (Fr. 3) had been present;
but as they could not agree, the whole matter was re­ ferred to Jupiter;
who, expressing his vexation that he was not present at the first meeting, blames some and praises others.
(Fr. 55, inc.)
The cause of his absence was probably the same as that described (Iliad xiv. 307—327) by Homer;
which passage Lueilius probably meant to ridicule.
(Fr. 15.)
The result of the deliberation is a determination on the part of the gods, that the only way to save the Roman state is by requiring the expiatory sacrifice of the most flagitious and impious amongst the citizens;
and the three fixed upon are, P. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, L. Papirius Carbo, and C. Hostilius Tubulus.
(To this book may perhaps also be referred Fr. inc. 2, 46, 61, 63.)
This book must have been published subsequently to the death of Carneades, which took place the same year as that of Scipio, B. C. 129, twenty-six years after his embassy to Rome.1 .... held counsel about the chief affairs of men—2 I could have wished, could it so have happened ..
I could have wished, at that council of yours before which you mention, I could have wished, Celestials, to have been present at your previous council!3 .... that there is none of us, but without exception is styled " Best Father of Gods," as Father Neptune, Liber, Saturn, Father Mars, Janus, Father Quirinus.4 Had Tubulus, Lucius, Lupus, or Carbo, that son of Nep­ tune, believed that there were gods, would he have been so perjured and impious ?5 .... in what way it might be possible to preserve longer the people and city of Rome.6 .... though many months and days .... yet wicked men would not admire this age and time.
7
When he had spoken these words, he paused-8 Not even though Orcus should send back Carneades him­ self...9 ... made ædile by a Satura ;
who from law may loose ...10 ... against whom, should the whole people conspire, they would be scarce a match for him—11 ... they might, however, discharge their duty and de­ fend the walls.12 ... might put it off, if not longer, at least to this one lustrum.13 I will bring them to supper;
and first of all will give each of them, as they arrive, the bellies of thunny and heads of acharne.14 ...15 .... so that I could compare [the embraces] of Leda daughter of Thestius, and the spouse of Ixion.16
These things we have sent, written to thee, Lucius Ælius !17 .. to creep on, as an evil gangrene, or ulcer, might.18 A countenance too, like .... death, jaundice, poison.19 .... to hate the infamous, vile, and disgraceful cook's shop.20 prætextæ and tunics, and all that foul handiwork of the Lydians.
21 Velvets and double piles, soft with their thick naps.22 .. that, like an angry cur, speaks plainer than a man.23 .. the common herd stupidly look for a knot in a bulrush.24 ... and legions serve for pay.25 .... quote prodigies, elephants.26 ... ladles and ewers.
27 Vulture.28 ... like a fool, you came to dance among the Pathics.29
Oh the cares of men !
Oh how much vanity is there in human affairs!
On the subject of this book the commentators differ;
some supposing that it was directed against luxury and effeminacy.
But the avarice and licentiousness of the times form a considerable portion of the writings of Lucilius, and there are very few of his Satires in which these are not in­ cidentally glanced at.
From the sixth Fragment, which after all is a very obscure one, Ellendt supposed it was written to expose Æmilius Scaurus.
Corpet maintains that it contained the description of a sanguinary brawl, in which many persons were engaged;
that one person was taken up for dead, his house purified, (Fr. 22,) and all preparations made for his funeral, when some one saw another lying in his bier.
Fr. 1. It is quite clear that Fr. 14, 24, and perhaps 2, refer to luxury;
if by Manlius, in the second Fragment, is intended Cn. Manlius Vulso.
(Vid. note.)1 ... whom, when Hortensius and Posthumius had seen ;
the rest, too, saw that he was not on his bier, and that another was lying there.
2 Hostilius ... against the plague and ruin which that halting Manlius, too, [introduced among] us.3 .. which were all removed in two hours, when the sun set, and was enveloped in darkness.
4 ... that he, having been ill-treated, attacked the other's jaws, and beat the breath out of him.
5
Now for the name:
next I will tell you what I have got out of the witnesses, by questioning.6 ... which I charm and wrest and elicit from Æmilius.
7
I say not.
Even though he conquer, let him go like a vagabond into exile, and roam an outlaw.
8
The prætor is now your friend;
but if Gentilis die this year, he will be mine-9 ... if he has left on his posteriors the mark of a thick and large-headed snake.10
Of a rough-actioned, sorry, slow-paced jade-11 ... that unclean, shameless, plundering fellow.12
Sleeved tunics of gold tissue, scarfs, drawers, turbans.13
What say you ?
Why was it done ?
What is that guess of yours ?14 .... who may now ruin you, Nomentanus, you rascal, in every thing else !15 So surrounded was I with all the cakes.16 .. to penetrate the hairy purse.l7 .... for a man scarce alive and a mere shadow.18 as skilled in law.19 ... he would lead these herds-20 .. for what need has he of the amulet and image attached to him, in order to devour fat bacon and make rich dishes by stealth.21 .... her that shows light by night.22 .. purified—expiated—23 .... a journey from the lowermost (river) to be told, and heard.
24
Long life to you, gluttons, gormandizers, belly-gods.25 .... him that wanders through inhospitable wastes there accompanies the greater satisfaction of things conceived in his mind.
We have not only much more ample and satisfactory information respecting the subject of this Satire from ancient writers, but the Fragments which have come down to us give sufficient evidence that their statements are correct.
It is the description of a journey which Lucilius took from Rome to Capua, and thence to the Straits of Messina;
with an account of some of the halting-places on his route, and incidents of travel.
Besides this, which was the main subject, he indulged by the way in a little pleasing raillery against some of his contemporaries, Ennius, Pacuvius, Cæcilius, and Terence, according to the old Scholiast.
This Satire formed the model from which Horace copied his Journey to Brundusium, i. Sat. v.
The special points of imitation will be seen in the notes ;
from which it will appear that the particular incidents mentioned by Horace, are probably fictitious.
As to the journey itself, Varges and Gerlach are both of opinion that it was a real one, and undertaken solely for purposes of pleasure ;
as it was not unusual for the wealthier Romans of that day to travel into Campania, or even to Lucania, and as far as the district of the Bruttii.
(Cf. Hor. i. Sat. vi. 102, seq.)
These journeys were occasionally performed on foot:
as we hear of Cato travelling on foot through the different cities of Italy, bearing his own arms, and attended only by a single slave, who carried his baggage and libation-cup for sacrificing.
But Lucilius probably on this occasion had his hackney, (canterius,) like Horace, which carried not only his master's saddle-bags, but himself also.
(Cf. Fr. 9. Hor. i. Sat. vi 104.)
It is not quite clear whether the scene described at Capua was a gladiatorial exhibition, or merely a drunken brawl that took place in the streets, from which one of the parties came very badly off.
Several of the " uncertain Fragments " may be fairly referred to this book;
evidently Fr. inc. 27.
Cf. Hor. i. Sat. v. 85. Probably Fr. inc. 77, 95, 53, 11, 10, 14, 36.1 ... you will find twice five and eighty full miles;
from Capua too, two hundred and fifty—2 ... from the gate to the harbour, a mile ;
thence to Salernum.3 ... thence to the people of the Dicæarcheans and Delos the less.5 .... three miles in length.6 ...
But there, all these things were mere play-and no odds.
They were no odds, I say, all mere play-and a joke.
The real hard work was, when we came near the Setine country ;
goat-clambered mountains ;
Ætnas all of them, rugged Athosès.

Besides, the whole of this way is toilsome and muddy-8 Moreover, the scoundrel, like a rascally muleteer, knocked against all the stones-9
My portmanteau galled my hackney's ribs by its weight.10

The Scholiast, on the third Satire of Persius, tells us that the subject of that Satire, which is directed against the luxury and vices of the rich, was borrowed from the fourth book of Lucilius.
In all probability the form of the Satire is not the same;
as the dialogue between the severe censor and his pupils approaches too near the Greek form, to have suited the taste of Lucilius.
No doubt there is a much closer imitation in the second Satire of Horace's second book, which also was confessedly composed upon this model;
where the plain and rustic simplicity of Ofella takes the place of the grave and sententious philosophy of the more dignified Lælius.
The first six Fragments are evidently to be referred to Lselius ;
expatiating on the praises of frugality, and exhibiting, by examples, the hollowness of all the pleasures of luxury and gluttony.
We have then allusions to a combat of gladiators;
and several references to women, and to the impetuous and restless anxieties attendant upon the passion of love ;
which are incon­ sistent with the character of Lælius, and were therefore put into the mouth of some other speaker.
To the first part of the Satire we may probably refer the Fragments, 192, 193, 132, 133, incert.
1 # * * *
At which that wise Lælius used to give vent to railings ;
addressing the Epicures of our order-2 " Oli thou glutton, Publius Gallonius!
a miserable man thou art!" he says. “
Thou hast never in all thy life supped well, though all thou hast thou squanderest on that lobster and gigantic sturgeon !”3
If you ask me, we enjoy food well cooked, and seasoned and pleasing conversation—4 ... because you prefer sumptuous living, and dainties to wholesome food-5 .... to devise besides what each wished to be brought to him;

from which the snow has abated nought, or the wine-strainer robbed-7 ... there was Æserninus, a Samnite, at the games ex­ hibited by the Flacci, a filthy fellow, worthy of such a life, and such a station.
He is matched with Pacideianus, who was by far the very best gladiator since the world began-8 I will kill him, and conquer, said he, if you ask that:
But so I think it will be;
I will smite him on the face before I plant my sword in the stomach and lungs of Furius.
I hate the man !
I fight in a rage !
nor is there any further delay than till some one fits a sword to my right hand;
with such passion, and hatred of the man, am I transported with anger.9 .... although he himself was a good Samnite in the games, and with the wooden swords, rough enough for any one ..10 But if no woman can be of so hardy a body, yet she may remain juicy, with soft arms, and the open hand may rest on her breast full of milk-11 †Tisiphone devoured unguent from his lungs and fat;

The person to whom this book is addressed, is supposed by Sealiger to have been a professor of the art of rhetoric.
Lucilius complains that this friend, though he knew he had been ill, had never come to see him ;
and at the same time he ridicules the affected and pedantie style of language then in vogue in the schools of the rhetoricians.
He then glances slightly at the fickleness and inconstancy of his friend's attachment, contrasting the pre­ sent state of his feelings with his staunch friendship in former days;
at the same time assuring him that his own heart remains unchanged.
He ad­ mits, however, that there is some ground for excuse for this disappointment of his hopes, as even the good Tiresias of yore was occasionally found tripping.
(Fr. 10.)
The causes which lead to breach of friendship are then discussed, the chief of which is avarice, that lust of gold, that nothing can satiate;
while, meantime, the people are lacking the common neces­ saries of life.
With avarice, ambition springs up ;
as sure a divider of faithful hearts as avarice itself.
Yet Lælius, that true-hearted and single- minded man, could hold the highest offices of state, without losing his integrity of heart, or sacrificing the simplicity of his rugged virtues.
This treachery, however, is gradual in its growth.
(Fr. 3.)
At first a large bribe alone has power to sever the bonds of friendship ;
yet soon they give way before the most paltry inducement.
Yet such is the infatuation and gross folly of men, that they even aim at deceiving the gods themselves by an affectation of piety.
With this depraved state of morals he contrasts the frugal simplicity of ancient days, describing by the way the plain and homely elements that composed their forefathers' rustic meal.
There is supposed to be also an allusion in this book to one Q. Metellus Caprarius;
a man who proved the worthlessness of his character, both during his ad­ ministration as prætor, and afterwards when serving in the camp before Numantia.
(Fr. 11, 23, 20, 21, 22, Gerl.)
Horace had perhaps part of this Satire in view, when he wrote his first Satire of the first book;
especially where he mentions avarice as one of the causes which make men discon­ tented with their lot in life.
Very similar sentiments to those expressed in this book, may be found in Sallust also.
(Bell. Cat. c. xii. init.)1

Gerlach sees in it little more than Lucilius' favourite theme, the exposure of vile and sordid avarice.
The miser's anxious alarm for the safety of his money-bags, (Hor. i. Sat. i. 70, " Congestis undique saccis indormis inhians,") which he can­ not bear out of his sight, and from which no earthly power can tear him away, (Fr. 1, 2,) the miserable appliances of his scanty furniture, and the absence of any thing approaching to luxury.
or even comfort, form the first portion of the Satire.
The remaining Fragments seem rather to apply to the manners of the nobles.
Their insolent disregard of the feelings of others, (Fr. 4,) their unbridled licentiousness, their arrogance of look and bearing, and haughty contempt of all union with plebeians, are depicted in very bold language.
Yet these same men are described as condescending to the most servile and fulsome flattery in courting the favour of these same ple­ beians, when such condescension is necessary to advance their own am­ bitious schemes.
The extravagant gesture and overstrained language of some bad orator is then described, (Fr. 3,) which Gerlach considers to apply to one of these patricians when pleading his own cause.
Van Heusde refers to no one in particular, but Corpet supposes there is an allusion to Caius Gracchus, who is mentioned by Plutarch as having been “the first of the Romans who used violent gesticulation in speaking, walking up and down the rostrum, and pulling his toga from his shoulder."
What connexion the Fragment in which Crass-as and Mucius are mentioned has with the main subject, as also the allusion in Fr. 5 to some immodest female, is not known.1 .. who has neither hackney nor slave, nor a single at­ tendant.
His bag, and all the money that he has, he carries with him.

The general subject of the book seems to be agreed upon by all commentators, though they differ as to the details.
Schoenbeck says it is directed against the lusts of women ;
particularly the occasions where those lusts had most opportunity of being exhibited and gratified, the festivals of the Matron­ alia and the kindred Saturnalia.
Petermann considers that it refers simply to the intercourse between husbands and wives, in which view Dousa seems to coincide.
Duentzer takes a wider view, and says it refers to all licen­ tious pleasures.
Van Heusde leaves the matter undecided.
Gerlach coin­ cides with the general view, but supposes that the passions and the quarrels alluded to, must be referred to slaves, or at all events persons of the lowest station;
for whom festivals, like the Segellaria, (alluded to in Fr. 4,) were more particularly intended.
-The first two Fragments evidently describe a matrimonial brawl.
The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, refer to an unhallowed passion.
The fifth, sixth, and thirteenth, to the unnatural and effeminate refinements practised by a class of persons too often re­ ferred to in Juvenal and Persius.
The fifteenth, to the fastidious taste of those who professed to be judges of such matters.
The connexion of the seventh Fragment is uncertain, as it applies apparently to rewards for military service.

22 Here is Macedo if Acron is too long flaccid.
The eighth book, as Schoenbeck supposes, consisted of an exposition of do­ mestic life, with a discussion as to the virtues which a good wife ought to possess.
Duentzer would rather connect it with the last book, and imagines unlawful love to have been the theme, and that the ancient title of the book countenanced this opinion.
-The second, fourth, fifth, eleventh, and thir­ teenth Fragments seem to confirm the conjecture;
the drift of the others is not apparent.

The subject of the ninth book is known from several notices in the old grammarians.*
It is said to have contained strictures on the orthography of the ancient writers ;
some emendations of the verses of Accius and En­ nius, (with especial reference to the former, who is said to have always used double vowels to express a long syllable,) and a mention of the double genius, who, according to the notion of Euclides the Socratic, attends upon each individual of the human race.
The exact connexion of this latter topic with the foregoing, is not at present evident to us.
It appears that this book had anciently the title of " Fornix," as the work of Pomponius on a cognate subject was called “ Marsyas.
”Van Heusde supposes that it took its name from the Fabian arch on the Via Sacra, and that its sub­ ject resembled the ninth of Horace's first book of Satires.
The poet, in his walk along the Via Sacra, meets with a troublesome fellow near the arch of Fabius, who pesters him with a speech which he is about to deliver, as defendant in a cause, and which he wishes Lucilius to look over and cor­ rect ;
and that this furnishes the poet with the groundwork for a discussion on several points in grammar, orthography, and rhetoric.
With this view Gerlach so far agrees, as to suppose the subject of both Horace's and Lu­ cilius's Satires to have been similar ;
especially since many similar phrases and sentiments occur in both ;
but he considers a detailed disquisition on single letters and syllables, inconsistent with a desultory conversation, or with a cursory criticism of an oration, and considers it better to confess one's ignorance honestly, than indulge in vain-glorious conjecture, par­ ticularly, since many other Fragments of this book have come down to us, wholly irreconcilable with this view of the subject;
some referring to avarice, others to the Salii;
which though they might certainly be inci­ dentally mentioned, imply too diversified a subject to be definitely circum­ scribed within so limited an outline, as Van Heusde conjectures.
1 .. only let the nap of the woof stand erect within ....2 First is A.
I will begin with this;
and the words spelt with it.
In the first place, A is either a long or short syllable ;
consequently we will make it one, and, as we say, write it in one and the same fashion, “Pacem, Plăcide, Jānum, Aridum, Acetum," just as the Greeks do.
Ἄϱες "Αϱες.3 ... not very different from this, and badly put together, if with a burr like a dog, I say AR ......... this is its name.4 .... and there is no reason why you should make it a question or a difficulty whether you should write AC- CURRERE with a D or a T.5
But it is of great consequence whether ABBITERE have a D or B—6 "Now come PUEREI."
Put E and I at the end, to make " pueri " the plural;
if you put I only, as Pupilll, Puerl, Luceill, this will become the singular number.
" Hoc illi factum est unI."
Being singular, you will put I only. " Hoc IllEI fecere"
Add E to mark the plural.
Add also E to MendacEI and FurEI, when you make it the dative case.
" MEIle hominum, duo MEIlia."
Here too we must have both vowels, MEIles, MEIlitiam.
Pila, " a ball to play with," Pilum, " a pestle to pound with," will have I simply.
But to PEIla, "javelins," you must add E, to give the fuller sound.
7
Our S, and what after a semi-Greek fashion we call Sigma, admits of no mistake.8 ... in the word PeLLiciendo.
9 For just as we see Intro (within) to be a very different word from Intus, (inside,) so apud se is very different from, and has not the same force as, ad se. "
A man in­ vites us to come in and join him (intro ad se).
He keeps himself at home, inside his own house (intus apud se).
"10 " The water boils," may be expressed by Fervit (of the third conjugation), or Fervet (of the second conjugation).
Or again, Fervit may be the present tense, Fervet the fu­ ture;
both of the third conjugation.
11 So Fervĕre (with the E short, of the third conjugation).
12
You do not perceive the force of this;
or how this differs from the other.
In the first place, this which we call " Poema " is a small portion.
So also an epistle, or any distich-which is of no great length, may be a " Poema."
A " Poesis " is a whole work, as the whole Iliad;
it is one Thesis.
So also the Annals of Ennius, that is also a single work, and of much greater magnitude than what I just now styled Poëma.
Wherefore I assert, that no one who finds fault with Homer, finds fault with him all through ;
nor does he criticize, as I said before, the whole Poesis ;
but simply a single verse, word, proposition, or passage.13 ... that he is a misshapen old man, gouty in his joints and feet-that he is lame, wretched, emaciated, and rup­ tured—14 I seize his beak, and smash his lips, Zopyrus-fashion, and knock out all his front teeth.15

So be it.26 her motion was as though she were winnowing corn.
The old Scholiast, in his Life of Persius, tells us that " after he had quitted school, and the instruction of his tutors, he was so much struck with the tenth book of the Satires of Lucilius, that he was seized with a vehement desire of writing Satire, and immediately applied himself to the imitation of this book, and after first detracting from his own merits, proceeded to disparage the poetical attempts of others."
Van Heusde supposes that the book contained a detailed account of the life of Lucilius;
and hence the saying of the Scholiast, that " the whole life of Lucilius was as distinctly known as if it had been portrayed in pictures."
(So Horace says, Sat. II. i. 30,) " Quo fit ut omnis Votivà pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita senis."
He conjectures the difference between the subjects of the ninth and tenth books to have been this :
that in the ninth, Lucilius criticised the ignorance and corrected the mistakes of the Librarii;
i. e. those who copied the com­ positions of the poets, only incidentally, and by the way, touching on the poets themselves.
Whereas the tenth was intended directly as an attack upon the poets who preceded him.
Jahn, in his prolegomena on Persius, imagines this imitation of the tenth book to have been carried further than we are perhaps justified in assuming ;
he conjectures that the lion­ decasyllabic Prologue of Persius was a direct imitation of a similar proem, and in the same metre which formed the commencement of this book.
This opinion he fortifies by two quotations, one from Petronius, Sat. iv., the other from Apuleius, de Deo Soer. p. 364.
In this view Gerlach docs not coincide, though he is disposed to admit that Lucilius in all probability began the book with a disparagement of himself, and so far furnished an example for Persius to imitate.
It is a question that must remain doubt­ ful, and is of no great importance.
It is, however, also clear that this hook contained criticisms on the verses of Aceius and Ennius.
(Vid. Schol. ad Hor. i. Sat. x.)Perhaps the Fragments (incert. 3, 4, and 5) on Albutius and Mucius may have belonged to this book.
I ... as we wrote before, the judgment to be formed is concerning the honours of the Crassi ... that is, in each case let us lay down what I should choose, what not.
2 Behind stood the nimble skirmisher in his cloak.
3 .... although suddenly to bring down from three pair of stairs.

7 .... verily, he said, I cut up the ox magnificently in the temple.
8 ...... would seem importunate, boastful, bad, and ne­ farious.
Schoenbeck supposes this book to have been written in memory of the Ibe­ rian war;
because it not only touches on military affairs, but contains also some bitter sarcasms on the morals of certain young men, who served in that campaign.
Petermann coincides in the same opinion.
Corpet sup­ poses that the principal object of the book, was an elaborate defence of the character of Scipio Africanus;
especially with regard to the salutary and strict discipline which he restored to the Roman army during the Numan­ tine war.
Gerlach admits the probability of these conjectures, though he scarcely thinks that the Fragments which have come down to us of this book, are of sufficient length to enable us to pronounce definitively on the question.
It is quite clear that the mention of Opimius the father, or of the elder Lucius Cotta, can bear no relation to the Numantine war, since they both lived before it began ;
still it is possible that their names might have been introduced, to render the morals of their sons still more con­ spicuous.
How the Fragment (2) respecting the plebeian Caius Cassius Cephalo was connected with the main subject, is not clear;
unless he was introduced for the purpose of incidentally mentioning the bribery of the unjust judge, Tullius.
The fourth and ninth Fragments may clearly refer to the Numantine war;
as may perhaps the seventh;
as we learn from Cicero, that while Scipio Africanus was before Numantia, he received some munificent presents, which were sent to him from Asia by king Attalus, and which he ac­ cepted in the presence of his army.
(Cic. pro Dei, 7.)
This happened probably only a few months before the death of Attains ;
and Lucilius was most likely an eyewitness of the fact.
The thirteenth Fragment also may refer to the same campaign;
though Diintzer supposes it to be an allusion to the miserable penurionsness of Ælius Tubero.
The fifth and sixth Fragments apparently refer rather to civil than military matters.
1 QUINTUS Opimius, the famous father of this Jugurthinus, was both a handsome man and an infamous, both in his early youth ;
latterly he conducted himself more uprightly.
2
This Caius Cassius, a labourer, whom we call Cefalo—a cut-purse and thief—him, one Tullius, a judge, made his heir ;
while all the rest were disinherited.

he is now a soldier in winter quarters, serving with us10 .. thence, while still of tender age and a mere boy, comes to Rome11 Nor have I need of him as a lover, nor a mean fellow to bail me-12 .. he is a jibber, a shuffler, a hard-mouthed, obstinate brute.13

The extant Fragments of this book are too few and too varied in their mat­ ter to enable us to form any definite idea of the general subject.
From a passage in Diomedes, (lib. iii. p. 483,) which contains the seventh Frag­ ment, Schoenbeck supposes it must have referred to scenic matters;
which conjecture he considers further strengthened by the first Fragment.
(Cf. Plaut.
Pers. I. iii. 78.)
But, as Gerlach observes, " Chorago " in this passage can hardly be understood in its primitive sense, since it is coupled with the word " Quæstore ;
" and as the quæstors had nothing to do with the Ludi Scenici, except when it fell to them to take the place of the præ­ tors or ædiles, this office could hardly be reckoned amongst their positive or regular duties.
1 ... that this man stands in need of some quæstor and choragus to furnish gold at the public expense, and from the treasury.

The Fragments of this book, as well as of the twelfth, are too few to admit of any opinion being satisfactorily arrived at with respect to its subject.
Schoenbeck supposes it was directed against sumptuous extravagance and luxurious banquets.
Petermann adopts the same view.
Gerlach, though he considers the Fragments so vague that they might support any hypo­ thesis, allows that this conjecture is tenable, as the third, fifth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh appear to " savour of the kitchen."

Duentzer, on the other hand, says the subject was ambition.
The two notions are not so much opposed, says Gerlach, as at first sight they seem;
the object of the poet being to contrast the frugal simplicity and tranquil leisure of a rustic life, with the empty vanities and arrogant assumption of the ambitious man.
Thus the Fragments 2, 4, 5, 12, 15, 16, and perhaps 1, contain the praises of frugal parsimony and an honourable leisure;
3, 6, 7, 8, and perhaps others, describe the heart-burn­ ings and disappointments of a life devoted to ambition.

who says that the poet intended it as a defenee of true tranquillity of mind, in opposition to the precepts and dogmas of the Stoies.
In the sixth Frag­ ment we certainly have mention made of a philosopher;
but it is only to assert that many common and homely articles in daily and constant use, are of more real value than any philosopher of any sect.
This, however, may be supposed to be the opinion of some vulgar and ignorant plebeian, or of a woman.
In the fifth Fragment we have the eharaeter of a wife portrayed, such as Juvenal describes so graphically in his sixth Satire.
Indolent and slatternly in her husband's presence, she reserves all her graces of manner and elegance of ornament for the presenee of strangers.
We have besides a notice of the wonders in Homer's narratives, the praises of a good horse, a picture of an usurer, an account of a soldier who has seen service in Spain, an eulogy of frugality, and other matters;
how all these can possibly be arranged under one head, is, as Gerlach says, a matter of the greatest obscurity.
1 MEN think that many wonders described in Homer's verses are prodigies ;
amongst the chief of which is Polyphemus the Cyclops, two hundred feet long :
and then besides, his walking-stick, greater than the main-mast in any mer­ chantman—2 ... no high-actioned Campanian nag will follow him that has conquered by a mile or two * * * *3 ... moreover, as to price, the first is half an as, the second a sestertius, and the third more than the whole bushel.

We have in the old grammarians two conflicting accounts of the subject of this book.
Censorinus (de Die Natali, iii.) says that it contained a dis­ cussion on the " double genius " which the Socratic Euclidcs assigned to all the human race.
On the other hand, Porphyrion (in a note of the twenty-second ode of Horace's first book) 'tells us that, Horace here imi­ tated Lucilius, who inscribed his sixteenth book to his mistress Collyra;
hence this book was called Collyra, as the ninth was styled Fornix (in which also we may observe that it was stated that the double genius of Euclides was discussed).
Priscian again seems to imply (III. i. 8) that it was inscribed to Fundius;
and that Horace copied from it his fourteenth Epistle of the first book.
Gerlach considers the 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Fragments may form part of a conversation between Lucilius and his stew­ ard, on the true use of riches.
The 10th Fragment may refer to Collyra, especially if we may suppose that the 13th Fragment (incert.) refers to the same person.
If so, she was probably, like the Fornarina of Raffaelle, some buxom ἀρτοκόπος (cf. Herod. i. 51) or confectioner.
And this her name seems to imply, Collyra being a kind of circular wheaten-cake, either prepared in a frving-pan, or baked on the coals or in an oven.
(Cf. Coli­ phium, Juv. ii. 53, and Plaut. Pers. 1. iii. 12, " Collyræ facite ut madeant et coliphia.")
She is therefore the " valida pistrix " who understands the whole mystery of making Mamphulæ, which, as Festus tells us, was a kind of Syrian bread or cake, made without leaven.

This book contained, according to Schoenbeck's view, a discussion on the dogma of the Stoics, " that no one could be said to possess any thing pe­ culiarly his own."
The poet therefore ridicules the creations of the older poets, who have dignified their heroines with every conceivable embellish­ ment, and invested them with the attractions of every virtue that adorns humanity.
He then goes through the list of all the greatest mythological personages that occur in the various Epic poets, in order to show the fal­ lacy of their ideas, and establish his own theory on the subject of moral virtue.
—Gerlach, on the other hand, considers that the subject was merely a disparagement of the boasted virtues of the female character;
by show­ ing that even these creations of ideal perfection, elaborated by poets of the greatest genius, and endowed with every excellence both of mind and body, are not even by them represented as exempt from those passions and vices which disgrace their unromantic fellow-mortals.
In this general detrac­ tion of female purity, not even the chaste Penelope herself escapes.
The 6th Fragment seems to be directed against those whose verses are com­ posed under the inspiration of sordid gain.
1
Now that far-famed lady with the " beautiful ringlets," “and beautiful ancles ? " Do you think it was forbidden to touch her ......?

From the small portion of this book that has come down to us, it is but mere idle conjecture to attempt to decide upon its subject.
Petermann says it treated " of fools and misers."
There are some lines in the first Satire of Horace's first book, which bear so close a resemblance to some lines in this book, that Gerlach considers it was the model which Horace had before his eyes.
The passages are quoted in the notes.
1 TAKE twelve hundred bushels of corn, and a thousand casks of wine ..2
In short, as a fool never has enough, even though he has every thing ..3 ... for even in those districts, there will be drunk a cup tainted with rue and sea-onion ..4 ..

The same may be said of this book as of the eighteenth.
The few Fragments that remain being insufficient to furnish any data for a positive opinion as to its subject.
From the 2nd and 3rd Fragments, Mercer supposes that the same question was discussed, which Cicero refers to in the Offices, (lib. ii. c. 20,) "
Whether a worthy man, without wealth, was to be pre­ ferred to a very rich man who had but an indifferent reputation."
The second Fragment clearly contains a precept respecting the laying up a store which may be made available in time of distress ;
which Horace had per­ haps in his eye in book i. Sat. i. 1. 33, seq.
Itcontains likewise a criticism on a verse of Eunius, as being little more than empty sound, devoid of true poetic sentiment;
which probably was the basis of Cicero's censure in the Tusculan disputations.
The study of dramatic composition is also dis­ couraged, from the fact that the most elaborate passages are frequently spoiled by the want of skill in the Tragic actor.
In the 9th Fragment, Däcke supposes there is an allusion to the Dulorestes of Pacuvius.
The 7th Fragment may also probably refer to Ennius, as the principal word in it is employed by him in the eleventh book of his Annals.
There is pro­ bably also a hit at those poets who adopt a style of diction quite unintelli­ gible to ordinary readers.
1 WRINKLED and shrivelled old men are in quest of all the same things.
2
So do thou seek for those fruits, which hereafter in unge­ nial winter thou mayest enjoy;

The tragic poet who spoils his verses through Orestes about to grow hoarse.10 .. twenty thousand gravers and pincers11 .... and to pluck out teeth with crooked pincers.12 .... desire may be eradicated from a man, but never covetousness from a fool.
Gerlach without hesitation pronounces the subject of this book to have been “the superstition of the lower orders, and the luxury of the ban­ quets of the wealthy."
There were, even in the days of Lucilius, many who could see through, and heartily despise, the ignorant superstition by which their fellow-men were shackled.
Hence the famous saying of Cato, that he wondered how a soothsayer could look another of the same pro­ fession in the face without laughing.
The 3rd and 4th Fragments are probably part of the speech of some notorious epicure, who cordially de­ tests the simplicity and frugality of ancient days;
and the 5th may con­ tain the fierce expression of his unmeasured indignation at any attempt to suppress or curtail the lavish munificence and luxurious self-indulgence of men like himself.
The 6th, 7th, and 9th Fragments may also refer to the sumptuous banquets of the day.
1 THESE bug-bears, Lamiæ, which the Fauni and Numas set up,—at these he trembles, and sets all down as true..

Gerlach considers this book to contain the strongest evidences of how much Horace was indebted to Lucilius, not only in the choice of his subjects, but also in his illustration and method of handling the subject when chosen.
In the 105th of the Fragments incerta, we find the words " Valeri sententia dia" (which Horace imitates, i. Sat. ii. 32, " sententia dia Catonis”).
By Valerius he here supposes Q. Valerius Soranus to be intended;
a man of great learning, and an intimate friend of Publius Scipio and Lucilius.
He was author of a treatise on grammar, entitled ἐποπτίδων;
which contained, according to Turnebe's conjecture, a dis­ cussion on the mysteries of literature and learning (ἐπόπτης being applied to one initiated into the Mysteries).
This is not improbable ;
as he is said to have lost his life for divulging the sacred and mysterious name of Rome.
Vid. Pluto Qu. Rom. lxi. [Two verses of his are quoted by Varro, L. L. vii. 3, & x. 70. Cf. Plin. H. N. Præf. p. 6, Hard. A. Gell. ii. 10.]With him, therefore, as a man of judgment and experience, Lucilius, who had already acquired some ill-will from his Satires, consults, as to the best method of avoiding all odium for the future, and as to the subjects he shall select for his compositions.
This book then contains an account of this interview between the poet and his adviser;
and Gerlach most in­ geniously arranges the fragments in such an order, as to represent in some manner the topics of discussion in a methodical sequence.
These are, chiefly, the propriety of his continuing to pursue the same style of writing, and the enunciation of the opinions of both on matters relating to war, marriage, and literary pursuits.
Van Heusde and Schoenbeck give no definite idea of the subject.
Peter­ mann considers the subject matter to have been far more diversified.
The book begins, in his opinion, with a vivid description of the miseries of conjugal life, introducing a very graphic matrimonial quarrel;
this is followed by so infinitely diversified a farrago of sentiments, that it is hopeless to attempt to establish any systematic connexion between them.
Corpet considers the whole to have been a philosophical discussion of the miseries of human life, especially those attendant on the married state, which the poet illustrated by the very forcible example of Agamemnon and Clytæmnestra.
The whole of the book was composed in the Trochaic metre ;
consisting of tetrameters catalectic and acatalectic.
A few Fragments consist of Iambic heptametcrs and octometers, (Iambici septenarii et octonarii,) unless, as is not improbable, these lines have been referred to this book, through the inadvertence of grammarians or copyists.
It might, however, have been intentional, as in the succeeding books we find Iambic, Trochaic, and Dactylic metres, indiscriminately employed.

The Fragments of this book are of too diversified a character to form a cor­ rect conclusion with regard to the general subject.
Corpet admits the difficulty, but considers that it contained a criticism upon the philosophic opinions of the day.
Mercer thinks that the principal portion was occu­ pied by a matrimonial discussion, in which the lady had decidedly the better of the argument;
who being sprung from a more noble descent, and being possessed of a more ample fortune, considered that the control of the household pertained to herself, as a matter of right.
These conjectures, however satisfactory as far as they go, will not sufficiently account for the greater portion of the Fragments.
Gerlach supposes that the book con­ tained a defence of the poet's own pursuits and habits of life against the attacks of calumniators.
The book begins, therefore, with a conversation between the poet and a friend, when the various points at issue are brought forward and refuted.
The chief of these are the study of poetry;
which, as Lucilius maintains, conduces greatly to the well being of the state.
He then defends his choice of the particular branch of poetry which he has adopted, and proves that his satiric view is to be attributed to no arrogance, self-sufficiency, or malevolence, or envy towards his fellow-men ;
that he himself is possessed of a certain evenness of temper, neither elated by prosperity nor depressed by adversity.
The result of this temperament is an openness of heart, and frankness of disposition, which leads him to form friendships rapidly, without that cautious circumspection which commonly attends men of less equable tone of mind.
This peculiar dis­ position of mind is alto one which, extending to itself no indulgence for any frailty, is but little inclined to overlook the weaknesses of others, but impartially corrects the failings of itself and others:
whereas the more common character of mankind is to be indulgently blind to those faults to which they are themselves inclined, and severely critical of the imperfec­ tions of their neighbours.
While others, again, make it their whole study hypocritically to conceal their own defects.
He concludes with a sentiment which Horace has borrowed and enlarged upon, that whereas no perfec­ tion can be expected in this life, he is to be accounted to have arrived most nearly at the wished-for goal, who is disfigured by the fewest defects;
and since all human affairs are at the best but frail and fleeting, it is a charac­ teristic of wisdom out of evils to choose the least.

Lucilius greets the people in such elaborate verses as he can;
and all this too zealously and assiduously.
5 .. do you think Lucilius will be content, when I have wearied myself out, and used all my best endeavours ...6 .. for such a return as this indeed they foreboded, and to offend in no other thing.
7 ... those, too, who have approached the door they throw out of the windows on their head-8 .. that I envy no one, nor often cast a jealous eye on their luxuries9 .. he on the other hand ... all things imperceptibly and gradually ... out of doors, that he might hurt no one10 nor, like the Greeks, at whatever question you ask, do we inquire, where are the Socratic writings ?11 This is little better than moderate ;

Van Heusde considers that this book contained some severe strictures on the part of a morose old man, or stern uncle, on the over-indulgence of a fond and foolish father.
Yet a considerable portion of the Satire seems to contain a defence of the poet himself against the assaults of some invidious maligners, and in order to do this, he enters, generally, into a discussion of the habits and manners of young men of the age.
Their licentiousness, he is prepared to admit, has been in great measure produced by the want of restraint in early youth.
This petulance developes itself in an uncon­ trolled licence of speech, regardless of all annoyance to the feelings of others, —in avarice,—in haughtiness, the peculiar vice of men of rank,—ambition, luxury, and love of sensual pleasure.
These charges he illustrates by a passage quoted from Cæcilius.
Even those who do show some taste for better things, and apply themselves to the cultivation of philosophy, do not, like Polemon, adopt the severe maxims of a self-denying system, but attach themselves to the school of Epicurus or Aristippus.
To such as these, all good advice, all endeavours to reclaim them to the rugged paths of a stricter morality, are utterly hopeless and unavailing.

The remains of this book are so mutilated and so diversified, that, as Ger­ lach says, " one might be disposed to imagine that the very essence of the subject was its unconnected variety."
Both he and Merula, however, consider that it contained a long episode on the state of morality in the good old days;
when the war with Hannibal rendered a luxurious in­ dulgence incompatible even with personal safety.
(Cf. Juv. vi. 291. Sulpic. 51, 52.)
An old man is introduced, inveighing bitterly against the sloth, the luxury, and immoderate extravagance of the young men of his day;
of their unscrupulousness as to the means by which the money was ac­ quired, which was squandered on their licentious pleasures.
He then describes one of these scenes of dissipation;
and shows how young men, once entangled in the snares of their worthless paramours, not only become lost to every principle of virtue and sense of shame, but are so completely enslaved and enthralled by their passions, that they are able to refuse no­ thing, however unworthy of them, which is exacted by their tyrannical mistresses.
This corruption extends itself, also, not only to the courts of law, where justice has become a matter of barter, both with advocates and judges, but its fatal effects may also be traced in the debasement and de­ terioration of literature, of poetry, and of the public taste.

WHEN he has done this, the culprit will be handed over along with others to Lupus:

. . . . still he will deprive him— 2 .. and rest assured in your mind, that it will be a very weighty reason indeed with me, which would draw me away from any thing that would serve you.3 .. who communicates to me what the difference is between the race of mankind and brutes, and what it is connects them together.

This is their way of reckoning:

73Most of the commentators seem to be agreed that the subject of this book was “matrimonial life."
Mercer considers that it contained an altercation between a married couple, in which the lady strenuously refuses to submit to the lawful authority of her husband.
Van Heusde says that in it were depicted the miseries of married life generally;
especially of those husbands who are so devoted to their wives, that they surrender the reins of govern­ ment into the hands of those, for whom the law compels them to provide subsistence, not only at the expense of their own personal labour, but also at the risk of life itself:
the only return which they receive as an equiva­ lent from the hands of their wives, being opprobrious language, ill-temper, haughty exaction, treachery, and unfaithfulness to the marriage-bed.
In addition to this, Gerlach thinks that in this, his last book, Lucilius reca­ pitulated the subjects of his previous Satires;
and consequently many Fragments are assigned to this book, which might easily be inserted in others.
Amongst other matters, the poet also defends himself against the malignant charges of envious critics, one, Gaius, being especially noticed
The story of the old lion, which Horace has copied, [i. Ep. i. 74,] may also lead us to suppose that the treachery of false friends formed part of the matter of the poem.
N. B. Gerlach considers that the 30th was undoubtedly the last book.
The passages quoted from subsequent books are the result of the carelessness of the Librarii.
These passages, therefore, will all be found incorporated into the preceding books.
If... Lamia and Pytho ... with sharp teeth .. those gluttonous, abandoned, obscene hags ...2 .. a sick and exhausted lion ...3
Then the lion said with subdued voice, " Why will you not come hither yourself ? "4 What does it mean ?
how does it happen that the footsteps, all without exception, lead inwards, and towards you ?5 For, be assured that disease is far enough removed from men in wine, when one has regaled himself pretty sump­ tuously.

Immediately, as soon as the gale has blown a little more violently, it has raised and lifted up the waves.

You may see all things glittering within, in the glowing recess.10 must I first break you in, fierce and haughty as you are, with a Thessalian bit, like an unbroken filly, and tame you down by war ?11 or when I am going some where, and have invented some pretext as to the goldsmiths, to my mother, a relation or female friend's.

heavens-while THUS hoarse Codrus perseveres
To force his Theseid on my tortured ears, Shall I not ONCE attempt " to quit the score," ALWAYS an auditor, and nothing more!
For ever at my side, shall this rehearse
His elegiac, that his comic verse, Unpunished ?
shall huge Telephus, at will, The livelong day consume, or, huger still, Orestes, closely written, written, too, Down the broad marge, and yet-no end in view !
Away, away !-None knows his home so well
As I the grove of Mars, and Vulcan's cell, Fast by the ޺Æolian rocks !
-How the Winds roar, How ghosts are tortured on the Stygian shore, How Jason stole the golden fleece, and how The Centaurs fought on Othrys' shaggy brow;
The walks of Fronto echo round and round-
The columns trembling with the eternal sound, While high and low, as the mad fit invades, Bellow the same trite nonsense through the shades.
I, TOO, CAN WRITE,-and, at a pedant's frown, ONCE pour'd my fustian rhetoric on the town ;
And idly proved that Sylla, far from power, Had pass'd, unknown to fear, the tranquil hour :
—
Now I resume my pen;
for, since we meet Such swarms of desperate bards in every street, 'Tis vicious clemency to spare the oil, And hapless paper they are sure to spoil.
But why I choose, adventurous, to retrace The Auruncan's route, and, in the arduous race, Follow his burning wheels, attentive hear, If leisure serve, and truth be worth your ear.
When the soft eunuch weds, and the bold fair Tilts at the Tuscan boar, with bosom bare ;
When one that oft, since manhood first appeared, Has trimmed the exuberance of this sounding beard, In wealth outvies the senate;
when a vile, A slave-born, slave-bred, vagabond of Nile, Crispinus, while he gathers now, now flings
His purple open, fans his summer rings ;
And, as his fingers sweat beneath the freight, Cries, " Save me—from a gem of greater weight! ”
'Tis hard a less adventurous course to choose, While folly plagues, and vice inflames the Muse.
For who so slow of heart, so dull of brain, So patient of the town, as to contain His bursting spleen, when, full before his eye, Swings the new chair of lawyer Matho by, Crammed with himself!
then, with no less parade, That caitiff's, who his noble friend betrayed, Who now, in fancy, prostrate greatness tears, And preys on what the imperial vulture spares !
Whom Massa dreads, Latinus, trembling, plies With a fair wife, and anxious Cams buys!
When those supplant thee in thy dearest rights, Who earn rich legacies by active nights ;
Those, whom (tbe shortest, surest way to rise)
The widow's itch advances to the skies!
Not that an equal rank her minions hold :
Just to their various powers, she metes her gold, And Proculeius mourns his scanty share, While Gillo triumphs, hers and nature's heir !
And let him triumph !
'tis the price of blood :
While, thus defrauded of the generous flood, The colour flies his cheek, as though he prest, With unsuspecting foot, a serpent's crest;
Or stood engaged at Lyons to declaim, Where the least peril is the loss of fame.
Ye gods !—what rage, what frenzy fires my brain,
When that false guardian, with his splendid train, Crowds the long street, and leaves his orphan charge To prostitution, and the world at large!
When, by a juggling sentence damned in vain, (For who, that holds the plunder, heeds the pain ?)
Marius to wine devotes his morning hours, And laughs, in exile, at the offended Powers:
While, sighing o'er the victory she won, The Province finds herself but more undone !
And shall I feel, that crimes like these require
The avenging strains of the Venusian lyre, And not pursue them ?
shall I still repeat
The legendary tales of Troy and Crete ;
The toils of Hercules, the horses fed On human flesh by savage Diomed, The lowing labyrinth, the builder's flight, And the rash boy, hurl'd from his airy height ?
When, what the law forbids the wife to heir, The adulterer's Will may to the wittol bear, Who gave, with wand'ring eye and vacant face, A tacit sanction to his own disgrace ;
And, while at every turn a look he stole, Snored, unsuspected, o'er the treacherous bowl!
When he presumes to ask a troop's command, Who spent on horses all his father's land, While, proud the experienced driver to display, His glowing wheels smoked o'er the Appian way :
—
For there our young Automedon first tried His powers, there loved the rapid car to guide;
While great Pelides sought superior bliss, And toyed and wantoned with his master-miss.
Who would not, reckless of the swarm he meets, Fill his wide tablets, in the public streets, With angry verse ?
when, through the mid-day glare, Borne by six slaves, and in an open chair, The forger comes, who owes this blaze of state To a wet seal, and a fictitious date ;
Comes, like the soft Mæcenas, lolling by, And impudently braves the public eye!
Or the rich dame, who stanched her husband's thirst With generous wine, but-drugged it deeply first!
And now, more dext'rons than Locusta, shows Her country friends the beverage to compose, And, midst the curses of the indignant throng, Bear, in broad day, the spotted corpse along.
Dare nobly, man !
if greatness be thy aim,
And practise what may chains and exile claim :
On Guilt's broad base thy towering fortunes raise, For Virtue starves on-universal praise!
While crimes, in scorn of niggard fate, afford
The ivory couches, and the citron board, The goblet high-embossed, the antique plate, The lordly mansion, and the fair estate !0 !
who can rest-who taste the sweets of life, When sires debauch the son's too greedy wife;
When males to males, abjuring shame, are wed, And beardless boys pollute the nuptial bed !
No :
INDIGNATION, kindling as she views, Shall, in each breast, a generous warmth infuse, And pour, in Nature and the Nine's despite, Such strains as I, or Cluvienus, write!
E'er since Deucalion, while, on every side, The bursting clouds upraised the whelming tide, Reached, in his little skiff, the forked hill, And sought, at Themis' shrine, the Immortals' will;
When softening stones grew warm with gradual life, And Pyrrha brought each male a virgin wife;
Whatever passions have the soul possest, Whatever wild desires inflamed the breast, Joy, Sorrow, Fear, Love, Hatred, Transport, Rage, Shall form the motley subject of my page.
And when could Satire boast so fair a field ?
Say, when did Vice a richer harvest yield ?
When did fell Avarice so engross the mind ?
Or when the lust of play so curse mankind ?—
No longer, now, the pocket's stores supply
The boundless charges of the desperate die :
The chest is staked !-muttering the steward stands, And scarce resigns it, at his lord's commands.
Is it a SIMPLE MADNESS,—I would know, To venture countless thousands on a throw, Yet want the soul, a single piece to spare, To clothe the slave, that shivering stands and bare !
Who called, of old, so many seats his own, Or on seven sumptuous dishes supped alone ?—
Then plain and open was the cheerful feast, And every client was a bidden guest;
Now, at the gate, a paltry largess lies, And eager hands and tongues dispute the prize.
But first, (lest some false claimant should be found,) The wary steward takes his anxious round, And pries in every face;
then calls aloud, " Come forth, ye great Dardanians, from the crowd! " For, mixed with us, e'en these besiege the door, And scramble for-the pittance of the poor! " Despatch the Prætor first," the master cries, " And next the Tribune." " No, not so;
” replies The Freedman, bustling through, " first come is, still, First served ;
and I may claim my right, and will !-
Though born a slave, ('tis bootless to deny, What these bored ears betray to every eye,)
On my own rents, in splendour, now I live, On five fair freeholds !
Can the PURPLE give Their Honours, more ?
when, to Laurentum sped, NOBLE Corvinus tends a flock for bread!- Pallas and the Licînii, in estate, Must yield to me :
let, then, the Tribunes wait."
Yes, let them wait!
thine, Riches, be the field!—
It is not meet, that he to HONOUR yield, To SACRED HONOUR, who, with whitened feet, Was hawked for sale, so lately, through the street.
O gold !
though Rome beholds no altars flame, No temples rise to thy pernicious name, Such as to Victory, Virtue, Faith are reared, And Concord, where the clamorous stork is heard, Yet is thy full divinity contest, Thy shrine established here, in every breast.
But while, with anxious eyes, the great explore
How much the dole augments their annual store, What misery must the poor dependant dread.
Whom this small pittance clothed, and lodged, and fed ?
Wedged in thick ranks before the donor's gates, A phalanx firm, of chairs and litters, waits :
Thither one husband, at the risk of life, Hurries his teeming, or his bedrid wife;
Another, practised in the gainful art, With deeper cunning tops the beggar's part;
Plants at his side a close and empty chair :
“My Galla, master;
give me Galla's share." " Galla !" the porter cries ;
" let her look out." " Sir, she's asleep.
Nay, give me ;
-can you doubt!
”What rare pursuits employ the clients' day I First to the patron's door their court to pay, Next to the forum, to support his cause, Thence to Apollo, learned in the laws, And the triumphal statues;
where some Jew, Some mongrel Arab, some—I know not who-
Has impudently dared a niche to seize,- Fit to be pagainst, or-what you please.-
Returning home, he drops them at the gate :
And now the weary clients, wise too late, Resign their hopes, and supperless retire, To spend the paltry dole in herbs and fire.
Meanwhile, their patron sees his palace stored
With every dainty earth and sea afford :
Stretched on tli' unsocial couch, he rolls his eyes
O'er many an orb of matchless form and size, Selects the fairest to receive his plate, And, at one meal, devours a whole estate !—
But who (for not a parasite is there)
The selfishness of luxury can bear?
See !
the lone glutton craves whole boars !
a beast Designed, by nature, for the social feast !-
But speedy wrath o'ertakes him:
gorged with food, And swollen and fretted by the peacock crude, He seeks the bath, his feverish pulse to still, Hence sudden death, and age without a Will!
Swift flies the tale, by witty spleen increast, And furnishes a laugh at every feast;
The laugh, his friends not undelighted hear, And, fallen from all their hopes, insult his bier.
NOTHING is left, NOTHING, for future times
To add to the full catalogue of crimes;
The baffled sons must feel the same desires, And act the same mad follies, as their sires.
VICE HAS ATTAINED ITS ZENITH :
-Then set sail, Spread all thy canvass, Satire, to the gale-But where the powers so vast a theme requires ?
Where the plain times, the simple, when our sires Enjoyed a freedom, which I dare not name, And gave the public sin to public shame, Heedless who smiled or frowned ?
-Now, let a line
But glance at Tigellinus, and you shine, Chained to a stake, in pitchy robes, and light, Lugubrous torch, the deepening shades of night;
Or, writhing on a hook, are dragged around, And, with your mangled members, plough the ground.
What, shall the wretch of hard, unpitying soul, Who for THREE uncles mixed the deadly bowl, Propped on his plumy couch, that all may see, Tower by triumphant, and look down on me !
Yes ;
let him look.
He comes !
avoid his way, And on your lip your cautious finger lay ;
Crowds of informers linger in his rear, And, if a whisper pass, will overhear.
Bring, if you please, iEneas on the stage, Fierce war, with the Rutulian prince, to wage;
Subdue the stern Achilles;
and once more, With Hylas!
Hylas!
fill the echoing shore ;
Harmless, nay pleasant, shall the tale be found, It bares no ulcer, and it probes no wound.
But when Lucilius, fired with virtuous rage, Waves his keen falchion o'er a guilty age, The conscious villain shudders at his sin, And burning blushes speak the pangs within ;
Cold drops of sweat from every member roll, And growing terrors harrow up his soul:
Then tears of shame, and dire revenge succeed-
Say, have you pondered well the adveut'rous deed ?
Now—ere the trumpet sounds-your strength debate ;
The soldier, once engaged, repents too late.
J. Yet I MUST write :
and since these iron times, From living knaves preclude my angry rhymes, I point my pen against the guilty dead, And pour its gall on each obnoxious head.
O FOR an eagle's wings!
that I might fly
To the bleak regions of the polar sky, When from their lips the cant of virtue falls, Who preach like Curii, live like Bacchanals !
Devoid of knowledge, as of worth, they thrust, In every nook, some philosophic bust;
For he, among them, counts himself most wise, Who most old sages of the sculptor buys ;
Sets most true Zenos, or Cleanthes' heads, To guard the volumes which he-never reads !
TRUST NOT TO OUTWARD SHOW :
in every street Obscenity, in formal garb, we meet.-
And dost thou, hypocrite, our lusts arraign, Thou ! of Socratic catamites the drain !
Nature thy rough and shaggy limbs designed To mark a stern,.
inexorable mind;
But all's so smooth below !—“ the surgeon smiles, And scarcely can, for laughter, lance the piles.
"Gravely demure, in wisdom's awful chair, His beetling eyebrows longer than his hair, In solemn state, the affected Stoic sits, And drops his maxims on the crowd by fits !— Yon Peribomius, whose emaciate air, And tottering gait, his foul disease declare, With patience I can view;
he braves disgrace, Nor skulks behind a sanctimonious face :
Him may his folly, or his fate excuse-
But whip me those, who Virtue's name abuse, And, soiled with all the vices of the times, Thunder damnation on their neighbour's crimes !"
Shrink at the pathic Sextus !
Can I be, Whate'er my guilt, more infamous than he ? ”
Varillus cries :
Let those who tread aright, Deride the halt;
the swarthy Moor, the white ;
This we might bear;
but who his spleen could rein, And hear the Gracchi of the mob complain ?
Who would not mingle earth, and sea, and sky, Should Milo murder, Verres theft, decry, Clodius adultery ?
Catiline accuse Cethegus, Lentulus, of factious views, Or Sylla's pupils, soil'd with deeper guilt, Arraign their master for the blood he spilt ?
Yet have we seen,—O shame, for ever fled !—
A barbarous judge start from the incestuous bed, And, with stern voice, those rigid laws awake, At which the powers of War and Beauty quake, What time his drugs were speeding to the tomb
The abortive fruit of Julia's teeming womb !-And must not, now, the most debased and vile, Hear these false Scauri with a scornful smile ;
And, while the hypocrites their crimes arraign, Turn, like the trampled asp, and bite again !
They must;
they do :
—When late, amidst the crowd, A zealot of the sect exclaimed aloud, Where sleeps the Julian law ?
Laronia eyed
The scowling Stoicide, and taunting, cried, " Blest be the age that such a censor gave, The groaning world to chasten and to save!
Blush, Rome, and from the sink of sin arise- Lo !
a THIRD CATO, sent thee from the skies!
But-tell me yet—
What shop the balm supplied, Which, from your brawny neck and bristly hide, Such potent fragrance breathes ?
nor let it shame
Your gravity, to show the vender's name."
If ancient laws must reassume their course, Give the Scantinian first its proper force.
Look, look at home ;
the ways of men explore-
Our faults, you say, are many;
theirs are more :
Yet safe from censure, as from fear, they stand, A firm, compact, impenetrable band!
We know your monstrous leagues ;
but can you find
One proof in us, of this detested kind ?
Pure days and nights with Cluvia, Flora led, And Tedia chastely shared Catulla's bed ;
While Hippo's brutal itch both sexes tried, And proved, by turns, the bridegroom and the bride!
We ne'er, with misspent zeal, explore the laws, We throng no forum, and we plead no cause :
Some few, perhaps, may wrestle, some be fed, To aid their breath, with strong athletic bread.
Ye fling the shuttle with a female grace, And spin more subtly than Arachne's race ;
Cowered o'er your labour, like the squalid jade, That plies the distaff, to a block belayed.
“Why Hister's freedman heired his wealth, and why His consort, while he lived, was bribed so high, I spare to tell ;
the wife that, swayed by gain, Can make a third in bed, and near complain, Must ever thrive :
on secrets jewels wait:
Then wed, my girls;
be silent, and-be great!"
Yet these are they, who, fierce in Virtue's cause, Consign our venial frailties to the laws ;
And, while with partial aim their censure moves, Acquit the vultures, and condemn the doves ! "
She paused :
the unmanly zealots felt the sway Of conscious truth, and slunk, abashed, away.
But how shall vice be shamed, when, loosely drest, In the light texture of a cobweb vest, You, Creticus, amid the indignant crowd At Prod a and Pollinea rail aloud ?—
These, he rejoins, are " daughters of the game."
Strike, then ;
-yet know, though lost to honest fame, The wantons would reject a veil so thin, And blush, while suffering, to display their skin. " But Sirius glows ;
I burn."
Then, quit your dress ;
'Twill thus be madness, and the scandal less.
0 ! could our legions, with fresh laurels crowned, And smarting still from many a glorious wound, Our rustic mountaineers, (the plough laid by, For city cares,) a judge so drest descry, What thoughts would rise ?
Lo !
robes, which misbecome
A witness, deck the awful bench of Rome ;
And Creticus, stern champion of the laws, Gleams through the tissue of pellucid gauze !
Anon from you, as from its fountain-head, Wide and more wide the flagrant pest will spread;
As swine take measles from distempered swine, And one infected grape pollutes the vine.
Yes,
Rome shall see you, lewdlier clad, erewhile, (FOR NONE BECOME, AT ONCE, COMPLETELY VILE,) In some opprobrious den of shame, combined With that vile herd, the horror of their kind, Who twine gay fillets round the forehead ;
deck With strings of orient pearl the breast and neck ;
Soothe the GOOD GODDESS with large bowls of wine, And the soft belly of a pregnant swine.-
No female, foul perversion !
dares appear, For males, and males alone, officiate here ;
" Far hence," they cry, " unholy sex, retire, Our purer rites no lowing horn require ! "
-At Athens thus, involved in thickest gloom, Cotytto's priests her secret torch illume ;
And to such orgies give the lustful night, That e'en Cotytto sickens at the sight.
With tiring-pins, these spread the sooty dye, Arch the full brow, and tinge the trembling eye ;
Those bind their flowing locks in cawls of gold, Swill from huge glasses of immodest mould, Light, filmy robes of azure net-work wear ;
And, by their Juno, hark !
the attendants swear!
This grasps a mirror—pathic Otho's boast, (Auruncan Actor's spoil,) where, while his host, With shouts, the signal of the fight required, He viewed his mailed form ;
viewed, and admired!
Lo, a new subject for the historic page, A MIRROR, midst the arms of civil rage !—
To murder Galba, was-a general's part!
A stern republican's—to dress with art!
The empire of the world in arms to seek, And spread-a softening poultice o'er the cheek !
Preposterous vanity!
and never seen,
Or in the Assyrian or Egyptian queen, Though one in arms near old Euphrates stood, And one the doubtful fight at Actium viewed.
Nor reverence for the table here is found ;
But brutal mirth and jests obscene go round :
They lisp, they squeal, and the rank language use Of Cybele's lewd votaries, or the stews :
Some wild enthusiast, silvered o'er with age, Yet fired by lust's ungovernable rage, Of most insatiate throat, is named the priest, And sits fit umpire of th' unhallowed feast;
Why pause they here ?
Phrygians long since in heart, Whence this delay to lop a useless part ?
Gracchus admired a cornet or a fife, And, with an ample dower, became his wife.
The contract signed, the wonted bliss implored, A costly supper decks the nuptial board ;
And the new bride, amid the wondering room, Lies in the bosom of the accursed groom !-
Say now, ye nobles, claims this monstrous deed, The Aruspex or the Censor ?
Can we need More expiations ?-sacrifices ?-vows ?
For calving women, or for lambing cows?
The lusty priest, whose limbs dissolved with heat, What time he danced beneath the Ancilia's weight, Now flings the ensigns of his god aside, And takes the stole and flammea of a bride!
Father of Rome!
from what pernicious clime, Did Latian swains derive so foul a crime ?
Tell where the poisonous nettle first arose, Whose baneful juice through all thy offspring flows.
Behold!
a man for rank and power renowned, Marries a man!—and yet, with thundering sound, Thy brazen helmet shakes not!
earth yet stands,
Fixed on its base, nor feels thy wrathful hands !
Is thy arm shortened ?
Raise to Jove thy prayer- But Rome no longer knows thy guardian care ;
Quit, then, the charge to some severer Power, Of strength to punish in the obnoxious hour. " To-morrow, with the dawn, I must attend
In yonder valley ! "
Why so soon ? "
A friend Takes HIM a husband there, and bids a few "— FEW, yet:
but wait awhile;
and we shall view Such contracts formed without or shame or fear, 195 And entered on THE RECORDS OF THE YEAR!
Meanwhile, one pang these passive monsters find, One ceaseless pang, that preys upon the mind ;
They cannot shift their sex, and pregnant prove
With the dear pledges of a husband's love:
Wisely confined by Nature's steady plan, Which counteracts the wild desires of man.
For them, no drugs prolific powers retain, And the Luperci strike their palms in vain.
And yet these prodigies of vice appear, Less monstrous, Gracchus, than the net and spear, With which equipped, you urged the unequal fight, And fled, dishonoured, in a nation's sight;
Though nobler far than each illustrious name
That thronged the pit, (spectators of your shame,) Nay, than the Prætor, who the SHOW supplied, At which your base dexterity was tried.
That angry Justice formed a dreadful hell, That ghosts in subterraneous regions dwell, That hateful Styx his sable current rolls, And Charon ferries o'er unbodied souls, Are now as tales or idle fables prized ;
By children questioned, and by men despised :
YET THESE, DO THOU BELIEVE.
What thoughts, declare, Ye Scipios, once the thunderbolts of war!
Fabricius, Curius, great Camillus' ghost!
Ye valiant Fabii, in yourselves an host!
Ye dauntless youths at fatal Cannæ slain!
Spirits of many a brave and bloody plain!
What thoughts are yours, whene'er, with feet unblest, An UNBELIEVING SHADE invades your rest ?
—Ye fly, to expiate the blasting view;
}
Fling on the pine-tree torch the sulphur blue, And from the dripping bay, dash round the lustral dew.
And yet-to these abodes we all must come, Believe, or not, these are our final home;
Though now Iërne tremble at our sway, And Britain, boastful of her length of day ;
Though the blue Orcades receive our chain, And isles that slumber in the frozen main.
But why of conquest boast ?
the conquered climes
Are free, 0 Rome, from thy detested crimes.
No ;
-one Armenian all our youth outgoes, And, with cursed fires, for a base tribune glows.
True :
such thy power, Example!
He was brought
An hostage hither, and the infection caught.- 0, bid the striplings flee!
for sensual art
Here lurks to snare the unsuspecting heart;
Then farewell, simple nature!
—Pleased no more, With knives, whips, bridles, (all they prized of yore,) Thus taught, and thus debauched, they hasten home, To spread the morals of Imperial Rome!
GRIEVED though I am to see the man depart, Who long has shared, and still must share, my heart, Yet (when I call my better judgment home) I praise his purpose ;
to retire from Rome, And give, on Cumæ’s solitary coast, The Sibyl-one inhabitant to boast!
Full on the road to Baiæ, Cumæ lies, And many a sweet retreat her shore supplies-
Though I prefer ev'n Prochyta's bare strand To the Suburra for, what desert land, What wild, uncultured spot, can more affright, Than fires, wide blazing through the gloom of night, Houses, with ceaseless ruin, thundering down, And all the horrors of this hateful town ?
Where poets, while the dog-star glows, rehearse, To gasping multitudes, their barbarous verse!
Now had my friend, impatient to depart, Consigned his little all to one poor cart:
For this, without the town, be chose to wait;
But stopped a moment at the Conduit-gate.-
Here Numa erst his nightly visits paid,
And held high converse with the Egerian maid :
Now the once -hallowed fountain, grove, and fane, Are let to Jews, a wretched, wandering train.
Whose furniture's a basket filled with hay,— For every tree is forced a tax to pay;
And while the heaven-born Nine in exile rove, The beggar rents their consecrated grove!
Thence slowly winding down the vale, we view The Egerian grots—ah, how unlike the true!
Nymph of the Spring;
more honoured hadst thou been, If, free from art, an edge of living green, Thy bubbling fount had circumscribed alone, And marble ne'er profaned the native stone.
Umbritius here his sullen silence broke, And turned on Rome, indignant, as he spoke.
Since virtue droops, he cried, without regard,
And honest toil scarce hopes a poor reward ;
Since every morrow sees my means decay, And still makes less the little of to-day ;
I go, where Dædalus, as poets sing, First checked his flight, and closed his weary wing :
While something yet of health and strength remains,
And yet no staff my faltering step sustains;
While few grey hairs upon my bead are seen,
And my old age is vigorous still, and green.
Here, then, I bid my much-loved home farewell-
Ab, mine no more!—there let Arturius dwell, And Catulus;
knaves, who, in truth's despite, Can white to black transform, and black to white, Build temples, furnish funerals, auctions hold, , Farm rivers, ports, and scour the drains for gold!
ONCE they were trumpeters, and always found, With strolling fencers, in their annual round, While their puffed cheeks, which every village knew, Called to “high feats of arms " the rustic crew :
Now they give Snows themselves ;
and, at the will
Of the base rabble, raise the sign-to kill, Ambitious of their voice :
then turn, once more, To their vile gains, and farm the common shore !
And why not every thing ?-since Fortune throws
Her more peculiar smiles on such as those, Whene’er, to wanton merriment inclined, She lifts to thrones the dregs of human kind!
But why, my friend, should I at Rome remain ?
I cannot teach my stubborn lips to feign ;
Nor, when I hear a great man's verses, smile, And beg a copy, if I think them vile.
A sublunary wight, I have no skill
To read the stars;
I neither can, nor will, Presage a father’s death ;
I never pried, In toads, for poison, nor-in aught beside.
Others may aid the adulterer's vile design, And bear the insidious gift, and melting line, Seduction's agents !
I such deeds detest;
And, honest, let no thief partake my breast.
For this, without a friend, the world I quit;
A palsied limb, for every use unfit.
Who now is loved, but he whose conscious breast Swells with dark deeds, still, still to be supprest ?
He pays, he owes, thee nothing, (strictly just,) Who gives an honest secret to thy trust;
But, a dishonest !-there, he feels thy power, And buys thy friendship high from hour to hour.
But let not all the wealth which Tagus pours In Ocean's lap, not all his glittering stores, Be deemed a bribe, sufficient to requite
The loss of peace by day, of sleep by night :
- 0 take not, take not, what thy soul rejects, Nor sell the faith, which he, who buys, suspects !
The nation, by the GREAT, admired, carest, And hated, shunned by ME, above the rest, No longer, now, restrained by wounded pride, I haste to show, (nor thou my warmth deride,) I cannot rule my spleen, and calmly see, A GRECIAN CAPITAL, IN ITALY !
Grecian ?
0, no !
with this vast sewer compared,
The dregs of Greece are scarcely worth regard :
Long since, the stream that wanton Syria laves
Has disembogued its filth in Tiber's waves, Its language, arts ;
o'erwhelmed us with the scum Of Antioch’s streets, its minstrel, harp, and drum.
Hie to the Circus !
ye who pant to prove A barbarous mistress, an outlandish love ;
Ilie to the Circus !
there, in crowds they stand, Tires on their head, and timbrels in their hand.
Thy rustic, Mars, the trechedipna wears, And on his breast, smeared with ceroma, bears A paltry prize, well-pleased ;
while every land, Sicyon, and Amydos, and Alaband, Tralles, and Samos, and a thousand more, Thrive on his indolence, and daily pour Their starving myriads forth :
hither they come, } And batten on the genial soil of Rome ;
Minions, then lords, of every princely dome!
A flattering, cringing, treacherous, artful race, Of torrent tongue, and never-blushing face ;
A Protean tribe, one knows not what to call, Which shifts to every form, and shines in all :
Grammarian, painter, augur, rhetorician, Rope-dancer, conjurer, fiddler, and physician, All trades his own, your hungry Greekling counts ;
And bid him mount the sky,—the sky he mounts!
You smile-was't a barbarian, then, that flew?
No, 'twas a Greek ;
'twas an ATHENIAN, too !
-Bear with their state who will :
for I disdain To feed their upstart pride, or swell their train :
Slaves, that in Syrian lighters stowed, so late, With figs and prunes, (an inauspicious freight,)
Already see their faith preferred to mine, And sit above me !
and before me sign !—
That on the Aventine I first drew air, And, from the womb, was nursed on Sabine fare, Avails me not!
our birthright now is lost, And all our privilege, an empty boast!
For lo!
where versed in every soothing art, The wily Greek assails his patron's heart, Finds in each dull harangue an air, a grace, And all Adonis in a Gorgon face ;
Admires the voice that grates upon the ear, Like the shrill scream of amorous chanticleer;
And equals the crane neck, and narrow chest, To Hercules, when, straining to his breast
The giant son of Earth, his every vein Swells with the toil, and more than mortal pain.
We too can cringe as low, and praise as warm, But flattery from the Greeks alone can charm.
See!
they step forth, and figure to the life, The naked nymph, the mistress, or the wife, So just, you view the very woman there, And fancy all beneath the girdle bare !
No longer now, the favourites of the stage Boast their exclusive power to charm the age ;
The happy art with them a nation shares.
GREECE IS A THEATRE, WHERE ALL ARE PLAYERS.
For lo!
their patron smiles,-they burst with mirth ;
He weeps,-they droop, the saddest souls on earth ;
He calls for fire,—they court the mantle's heat;
'Tis warm, he cries,-and they dissolve in sweat.
Ill-matched !-secure of victory they start, Who, taught from youth to play a borrowed part, Can, with a glance, the rising passion trace, And mould their own, to suit their patron's face ;
At deeds of shame their hands admiring raise, And mad debauchery's worst excesses praise.
Besides, no mound their raging lust restrains, All ties it breaks, all sanctity profanes;
Wife, virgin-daughter, son unstained before, And, where these fail, they tempt the grandam hoar :
They notice every word, haunt every ear, Your secrets learn, and fix you theirs from fear.
Turn to their schools :
—yon grey professor see, Smeared with the sanguine stains of perfidy !
That tutor most accursed his pupil sold!
That Stoic sacrificed his friend to gold!
A true-born Grecian !
littered on the coast, Where the Gorgonian hack a pinion lost.
Hence, Romans, hence !
no place for you remains, Where Diphilus, where Erimanthus reigns;
Miscreants, who, faithful to their native art, Admit no rival in a patron's heart :
-
For let them fasten on his easy ear, And drop one hint, one secret slander there, Sucked from their country's venom, or their own, That instant they possess the man alone;
While we are spurned, contemptuous, from the door, Our long, long slavery thought upon no more.
'Tis but a client lost !—and that, we find, Sits wondrous lightly on a patron's mind :
And (not to flatter our poor pride, my friend)
What merit with the great can we pretend, Though, in our duty, we prevent the day, And, darkling, run our humble court to pay;
When the brisk prætor, long before, is gone, And hastening, with stern voice, his lictors on, Lest his colleagues o'erpass him in the street, And first the rich and childless matrons greet, Alba and Modia, who impatient wait, And think the morning homage comes too late!
Here freeborn youths wait the rich servant's call, And, if they walk beside him, yield the wall ;
And wherefore ?
this, forsooth, can fling away, On one voluptuous night, a legion's pay, While those, when some Calvina, sweeping by, Inflames the fancy, check their roving eye, And frugal of their scanty means, forbear, To tempt the wanton from her splendid chair.
Produce, at Rome, your witness :
let him boast, The sanctity of Berecynthia's host, Of Numa, or of him, whose zeal divine Snatched pale Minerva from her blazing shrine :
To search his rent-roll, first the bench prepares, His honesty employs their latest cares :
What table does he keep, what slaves maintain, And what, they ask, and where, is his domain ?
These weighty matters, known, his faith they rate, And square his probity to his estate.
The poor may swear by all the immortal Powers, By the Great Gods of Samothrace, and ours, His oaths are false, they cry;
he scoffs at heaven, And all its thunders;
scoffs,—and is forgiven!
Add, that the wretch is still the theme of scorn, If the soiled cloak be patched, the gown o'erworn;
If, through the bursting shoe, the foot be seen, Or the coarse seam tell where the rent has been.
0 Poverty, thy thousand ills combined }
Sink not so deep into the generous mind, As the contempt and laughter of mankind !" Up ! up!
these cushioned benches,” Lectius cries, " Befit not your estates :
for shame!
arise."
For “shame!”—but you say well:
the pander's heir, .
The spawn of bulks and stews, is seated there ;
The cryer's spruce son, fresh from the fencer's school, And prompt the taste to settle and to rule.-
So Otho fixed it, whose preposterous pride First dared to chase us from their Honours' side.
In these cursed walls, devote alone to gain, When do the poor a wealthy wife obtain ?
When are they named in Wills ?
when called to share
The Ædile’s council, and assist the chair ?—
Long since should they have risen, thus slighted, spurned, And left their home, but- not to have returned !
Depressed by indigence, the good and wise, In every clime, by painful efforts rise;
HERE, by more painful still, where scanty cheer, Poor lodging, mean attendance,-all is dear.
In earthen ware HE scorns, at Rome, to eat, WHO, called abruptly to the Marsian's seat, From such, well pleased, would take his simple food, Nor blush to wear the cheap Venetian hood.
There's many a part of Italy, 'tis said, Where none assume the toga but the dead :
'
There, when the toil foregone and annual play, Mark, from the rest, some high and solemn day, To theatres of turf the rustics throng, Charmed with the farce that charmed their sires so long ;
While the pale infant, of the mask in dread, Hides, in his mother's breast, his little head.
No modes of dress high birth distinguish THERE;
All ranks, all orders, the same habit wear, And the dread Ædile's dignity is known, O sacred badge!
by his white vest alone.
But HERE, beyond our power arrayed we go, In all the gay varieties of show;
And when our purse supplies the charge no more, Borrow, unblushing, from our neighbour's store :
Such is the reigning vice ;
and so we flaunt, Proud in distress, and prodigal in want!
Briefly, my friend, here all are slaves to gold, And words, and smiles, and every thing is sold.
What will you give for Cossus' nod ?
how high
The silent notice of Veiento buy ?
-One favourite youth is shaved, another shorn ;
And, while to Jove the precious spoil is borne, Clients are taxed for offerings, and, (yet more To gall their patience,) from their little store, Constrained to swell the minion's ample hoard, And bribe the page, for leave to bribe his lord.
Who fears the crash of houses in retreat ?
At simple Gabii, bleak Præneste's seat, Volsinium's craggy heights, embowered in wood, Or Tibur, beetling o'er prone Anio's flood ?
While half the city here by shores is staid, And feeble cramps, that lend a treacherous aid :
For thus the stewards patch the riven wall, Thus prop the mansion, tottering to its fall;
Then bid the tenant court secure repose, While the pile nods to every blast that blows.0 !
may I live where no such fears molest, No midnight fires burst on my hour of rest!
For here 'tis terror all;
midst the loud cry Of " water!
water ! ” the scared neighbours fly, With all their haste can seize-the flames aspire, And the third floor is wrapt in smoke and fire, While you, unconscious, doze :
Up, ho !
and know,
The impetuous blaze which spreads dismay below, By swift degrees will reach the aerial cell, Where, crouching, underneath the tiles you dwell, Where your tame doves their golden couplets rear, " And you could no mischance, but drowning, fear! "" Codrus had but one bed, and that too short
For his short wife ;
" his goods, of every sort, Were else but few :
-six little pipkins graced
His cupboard head, a little can was placed
On a snug shelf beneath, and near it lay A Chiron, of the same cheap marble,—clay.
And was this all ?
0 no :
he yet possest A few Greek books, shrined in an ancient chest, Where barbarous mice through many an inlet crept, And fed on heavenly numbers, while he slept.- " Codrus, in short, had nothing."
You say true ;
And yet poor Codrus lost that nothing too !
One curse alone was wanting, to complete His woes :
that, cold and hungry, through the street, The wretch should beg, and, in the hour of need, Find none to lodge, to clothe him, or to feed !
But should the raging flames on grandeur prey, And low in dust Asturius' palace lay, The squalid matron sighs, the senate mourns, The pleaders cease, the judge the court adjourns;
All join to wail the city's hapless fate, And rail at fire with more than common hate.
Lo !
while it burns, the obsequious courtiers haste, With rich materials, to repair the waste :
This, brings him marble, that, a finished piece, The far-famed boast of Polyclete and Greece ;
This, ornaments, which graced of old the fane Of Asia's gods;
that, figured plate and plain ;
This, cases, books, and busts the shelves to grace, And piles of coin his specie to replace-
So much the childless Persian swells his store, (Though deemed the richest of the rich before,)
That all ascribe the flames to thirst of pelf, And swear, Asturius fired his house himself.0, had you, from the Circus, power to fly, In many a halcyon village might you buy Some elegant retreat, for what will, here, Scarce hire a gloomy dungeon through the year !
There wells, by nature formed, which need no rope, No labouring arm, to crane their waters up, Around your lawn their facile streams shall shower, And cheer the springing plant and opening flower.
There live, delighted with the rustic's lot, And till, with your own hands, the little spot;
The little spot shall yield you large amends, And glad, with many a feast, your Samian friends.
And, sure,-in any corner we can get, To call one lizard ours, is something yet!
Flushed with a mass of indigested food, Which clogs the stomach and inflames the blood, What crowds, with watching wearied and o'erprest, Curse the slow hours, and die for want of rest!
For who can hope his languid lids to close, Where brawling taverns banish all repose ?
Sleep, to the rich alone, " his visits pays :
"
And hence the seeds of many a dire disease.
The carts loud rumbling through the narrow way, The drivers' clamours at each casual stay, From drowsy Drnsus would his slumber take, And keep the calves of Proteus broad awake !
If business call, obsequious crowds divide, While o'er their heads the rich securely ride, By tall Illyrians borne, and read, or write, } Or, (should the early hour to rest invite,) Close the soft litter, and enjoy the night.
Yet reach they first the goal;
while, by the throng Elbowed and jostled, scarce we creep along;
Sharp strokes from poles, tubs, rafters, doomed to feel;
And plastered o'er with mud, from head to heel:
While the rude soldier gores us as he goes, Or marks, in blood, his progress on our toes!
See, from the Dole, a vast tumultuous throng, Each followed by his kitchen, pours along !
Huge pans, which Corbulo could scarce uprear, With steady neck a puny slave must bear, And, lest amid the way the flames expire, Glide nimbly on, and gliding, fan the fire;
Through the close press with sinuous efforts wind, And, piece by piece, leave his botched rags behind.
Hark!
groaning on, the unwieldy waggon spreads
Its cumbrous load, tremendous!
o'er our heads,
Projecting elm or pine, that nods on high, And threatens death to every passer by.
Heavens!
should the axle crack, which bears a weight
Of huge Ligurian stone, and pour the freight
On the pale crowd beneath, what would remain, What joint, what bone, what atom of the slain ?
The body, with the soul, would vanish quite, Invisible as air, to mortal sight !-
Meanwhile, unconscious of their fellow's fate, At home, they heat the water, scour the plate, Arrange the strigils, fill the cruise with oil, And ply their several tasks with fruitless toil:
For he who bore the dole, poor mangled ghost, Sits pale and trembling on the Stygian coast, Scared at the horrors of the novel scene, At Charon's threatening voice, and scowling mien ;
Nor hopes a passage, thus abruptly hurled, Without his farthing, to the nether world.
Pass we these fearful dangers, and survey
What other evils threat our nightly way.
And first, behold the mansion's towering size, Where floors on floors to the tenth story rise ;
Whence heedless garretteers their potsherds throw, And crush the unwary wretch that walks below !
Clattering the storm descends from heights unknown, Ploughs up the street, and wounds the flinty stone!
'Tis madness, dire improvidence of ill, To sup abroad, before you sign your Will;
Since fate in ambush lies, and marks his prey, From every wakeful window in the way :
Pray, then,-and count your humble prayer well sped, If pots be only-emptied on your head.
The drunken bully, ere his man be slain, Frets through the night, and courts repose in vain;
And while the thirst of blood his bosom burns, From side to side, in restless anguish, turns, Like Peleus' son, when, quelled by Hector's hand, His loved Patroclus prest the Phrygian strand.
There are, who murder as an opiate take, And only when no brawls await them wake :
Yet even these heroes, flushed with youth and wine, All contest with the purple robe decline;
Securely give the lengthened train to pass, The sun-bright flambeaux, and the lamps of brass.-
Me, whom the moon, or candle's paler gleam, Whose wick I husband to the last extreme, Guides through the gloom, he braves, devoid of fear :
The prelude to our doughty quarrel hear, If that be deemed a quarrel, where, heaven knows, He only gives, and I receive, the blows !
Across my path he strides, and bids me STAND !
I bow, obsequious to the dread command;
What else remains, where madness, rage, combine With youth, and strength superior far to mine ?"
Whence come you, rogue ? " he cries;
" whose beans to-night
Have stuffed you thus ?
what cobbler clubbed his mite, For leeks and sheep's-head porridge ?
Dumb !
quite dumb!
Speak, or be kicked.-
Yet, once again !
your home ?
Where shall I find you ?
At what beggar's stand (Temple, or bridge) whimp'ring with out-stretched hand ?
"Whether I strive some humble plea to frame, Or steal in silence by, 'tis just the same ;
I'm beaten first, then dragged in rage away;
Bound to the peace, or punished for the fray !
Mark here the boasted freedom of the poor!
Beaten and bruised, that goodness to adore, Which, at their humble prayer, suspends its ire, And sends them home, with yet a bone entire !
Nor this the worst;
for when deep midnight reigns, And bolts secure our doors, and massy chains, When noisy inns a transient silence keep, And harassed nature woos the balm of sleep, Then, thieves and murderers ply their dreadful trade ;
With stealthy steps our secret couch invade :
—
Roused from the treacherous calm, aghast we start, And the fleshed sword-is buried in our heart!
Hither from bogs, from rocks, and caves pursued, (The Pontine marsh, and Gallinarian wood,) The dark assassins flock, as to their home, And fill with dire alarms the streets of Rome.
Such countless multitudes our peace annoy, That bolts and shackles every forge employ, And cause so wide a waste, the country fears A want of ore for mattocks, rakes, and shares.0 !
happy were our sires, estranged from crimes;
And happy, happy, were the good old times, Which saw, beneath their kings', their tribunes' reign, One cell the nation's criminals contain !
Much could I add, more reasons could I cite, If time were ours, to justify my flight;
But see!
the impatient team is moving on, The sun declining ;
and I must he gone :
Long since, the driver murmured at my stay, And jerked his whip, to beckon me away.
Farewell, my friend!
with this embrace we part:
Cherish my memory ever in your heart;
And when, from crowds and business, you repair, To breathe at your Aquinum freer air, Fail not to draw me from my loved retreat, To Elvine Ceres, and Diana's seat :
-
For your bleak hills my Cumæ I '11 resign, And (if you blush not at such aid as mine)
Come well equipped, to wage, in angry rhymes, Fierce war, with you, on follies and on crimes.
AGAIN Crispinus comes !
and yet again,
And oft, shall he be summoned to sustain
His dreadful part :
-the monster of the times, Without ONE virtue to redeem his crimes!
Diseased, emaciate, weak in all but lust, And whom the widow's sweets alone disgust.
Avails it, then, in what long colonnades
He tires his mules ?
through what extensive glades
His chair is borne ?
what vast estates he buys,
What splendid domes, that round the Forum rise ?
Ah, no !-Peace visits not the guilty mind, Least his, who incest to adultery joined, And stained thy priestess, Vesta;
—whom, dire fate!
The long dark night and living tomb await.
Turn we to slighter vices :
-yet had these, In others, Scius, Titius, whom you please, The Censor roused ;
for what the good would shame, Becomes Crispinus, and is honest fame.
But when the actor's person far exceeds,
In native loathsomeness, his loathsom'st deeds, Say, what can satire ?
For a fish that weighed Six pounds, six thousand serterces he paid !
As those report, who catch, with greedy ear, And magnify the mighty things they hear.
Had this expense been meant, with well-timed skill, To gull some childless dotard of a Will ;
Or bribe some rich and fashionable fair, Who flaunts it in a close, wide-windowed chair ;
'Twere worth our praise :
-but no such plot was here.
'Twas for HIMSELF he bought a treat so dear !
This, all past gluttony from shame redeems, And even Apicius poor and frugal seems.
What!
You, Crispinus, brought to Rome, erewhile, Lapt in the rushes of your native Nile, Buy scales, at such a price!
you might, I guess,
Have bought the fisherman himself for less ;
Bought, in some countries, manors at this rate, And, in Apulia, an immense estate!
How gorged the emperor, when so dear a fish, Yet, of his cheapest meals, the cheapest dish, Was guttled down by this impurpled lord, Chief knight, chief parasite, at Cæsar’s board, Whom Memphis heard so late, with ceaseless yell, Clamouring through all her streets—“
Ho !
shads to sell!
"Pierian MAIDS, begin ;
-but, quit your lyres,
The fact I bring no lofty chord requires :
Relate it, then, and in the simplest strain, Nor let the poet style you MAIDS, in vain.
When the last Flavius, drunk with fury, tore The prostrate world, which bled at every pore, And Rome beheld, in body as in mind, A bald-pate Nero rise, to curse mankind ;
It chanced, that where the fane of Venus stands, Reared on Ancona's coast by Grecian hands, A turbot, wandering from the Illyrian main, Fill'd the wide bosom of the bursting seine.
Monsters so bulky, from its frozen stream, Mæotis renders to the solar beam, And pours them, fat with a whole winter's ease, Through the bleak Euxine, into warmer seas.
The mighty draught the astonished boatman eyes, And to the Pontiff’s table dooms his prize :
For who would.
dare to sell it ?
who to buy?
When the coast swarmed with many a practised spy, Mud-rakers, prompt to swear the fish had fled From Cæsar's ponds, ingrate !
where long it fed,
And thus recaptured, claimed to be restored To the dominion of its ancient lord!
Nay, if Palphurius may our credit gain, I Whatever rare or precious swims the main, Is forfeit to the crown, and you may seize
The obnoxious dainty, when and where you please.
This point allowed, our wary boatman chose To give-what, else, he had not failed to lose.
Now were the dogstar's sickly fervours o'er, Earth, pinched with cold, her frozen livery wore;
The old began their quartan fits to fear, And wintry blasts deformed the beauteous year, And kept the turbot sweet:
yet on he flew, As if the sultry South corruption blew.—
And now the lake, and now the hill he gains, Where Alba, though in ruins, still maintains The Trojan fire, which, but for her, were lost, And worships Vesta, though with less of cost.
The wondering crowd, that gathered to survey
The enormous fish, and barred the fisher's way, Satiate, at length retires ;
the gates unfold !—
Murmuring, the excluded senators behold
The envied dainty enter :
-On the man To great Atrides pressed, and thus began."
This, for a private table far too great, Accept, and sumptuously your Genius treat:
Haste to unload your stomach, and devour A turbot, destined to this happy hour.
I sought him not ;
-he marked the toils I set, And rushed, a willing victim, to my net.
"Was flattery e'er so rank !
yet he grows vain,
And his crest rises at the fulsome strain.
When, to divine, a mortal power we raise, He looks for no hyperboles in praise.
But when was joy unmixed ?
no pot is found, Capacious of the turbot's ample round :
In this distress, he calls the chiefs of state, At once the objects of his scorn and hate, In whose pale cheeks distrust and doubt appear, And all a tyrant's friendship breeds of fear.
Scarce was the loud Liburnian heard to say, " He sits," ere Pegasus was on his way ;
Yes :
-the new bailiff of the affrighted town, (For what were Prefects more?) had snatched his gown, And rushed to council:
from the ivory chair, He dealt out justice with no common care ;
But yielded oft to those licentious times, And where he could not punish, winked at crimes.
Then old, facetious Crispus tript along, Of gentle manners, and persuasive tongue :
None fitter to advise the lord of all, Had that pernicious pest, whom thus we call, Allowed a friend to soothe his savage mood, And give him counsel, wise at once and good.
But who shall dare this liberty to take, When, every word you hazard, life's at stake ?
Though but of stormy summers, showery springs- For tyrants' ears, alas!
are ticklish things.
So did the good old man his tongue restrain ;
Nor strove to stem the torrent's force in vain.
Not one of those, who, by no fears deterred, Spoke the free soul, and truth to life preferred.
He temporized-thus fourscore summers fled, Even in that court, securely, o'er his head.
Next him, appeared Acilius hurrying on, Of equal age,-and followed by his son;
Who fell, unjustly fell, in early years, A victim to the tyrant's jealous fears :
But long ere this were hoary hairs become A prodigy, among the great, at Rome;
Hence, had I rather owe my humble birth, Frail brother of the giant-brood, to earth.
Poor youth !
in vain the ancient sleight you try ;
In vain, with frantic air, and ardent eye, Fling every robe aside, and battle wage With bears and lions, on the Alban stage.
All see the trick :
and, spite of Brutus' skill, There are who count him but a driveller still ;
Since, in his days, it cost no mighty pains
To outwit a prince, with much more beard than brains.
Rubrius, though not, like these, of noble race, Followed with equal terror in his face ;
And, labouring with a crime too foul to name, More, than the pathic satirist, lost to shame.
Montanus' belly next, and next appeared
The legs, on which that monstrous pile was reared.
Crispinus followed, daubed with more perfume, Thus early!
than two funerals consume.
Then bloodier Pompey, practised to betray, And hesitate the noblest lives away.
Then Fuscus, who in studious pomp at home, Planned future triumphs for the Arms of Rome.
Blind to the event!
those arms, a different fate, Inglorious wounds, and Dacian vultures, wait.
160Last, sly Veiento with Catullus came, Deadly Catullus, who, at beauty's name Took fire, although unseen :
a wretch, whose crimes Struck with amaze even those prodigious times.
A base, blind parasite, a murderous lord, From the bridge-end raised to the council-board ;
Yet fitter still to dog the traveller's heels, And whine for alms to the descending wheels!
None dwelt so largely on the turbot's size, Or raised with such applause his wondering eyes;
But to the left (0, treacherous want of sight)
He poured his praise ;
—the fish was on the right!
Thus would he at the fencer's matches sit, And shout with rapture, at some fancied hit;
And thus applaud the stage-machinery, where The youths were rapt aloft, and lost in air.
Nor fell Veiento short :
-as if possest With all Bellona's rage, his labouring breast Burst forth in prophecy ;
" I see, I see The omens of some glorious victory!
Some powerful monarch captured !—lo, he rears, Horrent on every side, his pointed spears!
Arviragus hurled from the British ear :
The fish is foreign, foreign is the war.
"Proceed, great seer, and what remains untold, The turbot's age and country, next unfold;
So shall your lord his fortunes better know, And where the conquest waits and who the foe.
The emperor now the important question put, " How say ye, Fathers, SHALL THE FISH BE CUT?" " 0, far be that disgrace," Montanus cries ;
"
No, let a pot be formed, of amplest size, Within whose slender sides the fish, dread sire, May spread his vast circumference entire!
Bring, bring the tempered clay, and let it feel
The quick gyrations of the plastic wheel :
— But, Cæsar, thus forewarned, .make no campaign, Unless your potters follow in your train !
"Montanus ended ;
all approved the plan, And all, the speech, so worthy of the man!
Versed in the old court luxury, he knew
The feasts of Nero, and his midnight crew ;
Where oft, when potent draughts had fired the brain, The jaded taste was spurred to gorge again.- And. in my time, none understood so well
The science of good eating:
he could tell, At the first relish, if his oysters fed On the Rutupian, or the Lucrine bed;
And from a crab, or lobster's colour, name The country, nay, the district, whence it came.
Here closed the solemn farce.
The Fathers rise, And each, submissive, from the presence hies :
— Pale, trembling wretches, whom the chief, in sport, Had dragged, astonished, to the Alban court;
As if the stern Sicambri were in arms, Or the fierce Catti threatened new alarms;
As if ill news by flying posts had come, And gathering nations sought the fall of Rome !O! that such scenes (disgraceful at the most)
Had all those years of cruelty engrost, Through which his rage pursued the great and good, Unchecked, while vengeance slumbered o'er their blood!
And yet he fell !-for when he changed his game.
And first grew dreadful to the vulgar name, They seized the murderer, drenched with Lamian gore, And hurled him, headlong, to the infernal shore!
IF—by reiterated scorn made bold, Your mind can still its shameless tenor hold, Still think the greatest blessing earth can give, Is, solely at another's cost to live ;
If—you can brook, what Galba would have spurned, And mean Sarmentus with a frown returned, At Cæsar's haughty board, dependants both, I scarce would take your evidence on oath.
The belly's fed with little cost:
yet grant
You should, unhappily, that little want, Some vacant bridge might surely still be found, Some highway side ;
where, grovelling on the ground, Your shivering limbs compassion's sigh might wake, And gain an alms for " Charity's sweet sake!
What !
can a meal, thus sauced, deserve your care ?
Is hunger so importunate ?
when THERE, THERE, in your tattered rug, you may, my friend, On casual scraps more honestly depend ;
With chattering teeth toil o'er your wretched treat, And gnaw the crusts, which dogs refuse to eat !
—For, first, of this be sure :
whene'er your lord
Thinks proper to invite you to his board, He pays, or thinks he pays, the total sum Of all your pains, past, present, and to come.
Behold the meed of servitude!
the great Reward their humble followers with a treat, And count it current coin :
-they count it such, And, though it be but little, think it much.
If, after two long months, he condescend To waste a thought upon a humble friend, Reminded by a vacant seat, and write, " You, Master Trebius, sup with me to-night."
'Tis rapture all!
Go now, supremely blest, Enjoy the meed for which you broke your rest, And, loose and slipshod, ran your vows to pay, What time the fading stars announced the day ;
Or at that earlier hour, when, with slow roll, Thy frozen wain, Boötes, turned the pole;
Yet trembling, lest the levee should be o'er, And the full court retiring from the door !
And what a meal at last!
such ropy wine,
As wool, which takes all liquids, would decline ;
Hot, heady lees, to fire the wretched guests, And turn them all to Corybants, or beasts.-
At first, with sneers and sarcasms, they engage, Then hurl the jugs around, with mutual rage ;
Or, stung to madness by the household train, With coarse stone pots a desperate fight maintain;
While streams of blood in smoking torrents flow, And my lord smiles to see the battle glow !
Not such his beverage :
he enjoys the juice
Of ancient days, when beards were yet in use, Pressed in the Social War !—but will not send One cordial drop, to cheer a fainting friend.
To-morrow, he will change, and, haply, fill
The mellow vintage of the Alban hill, Or Setian ;
wines, which cannot now be known, So much the mould of age has overgrown
The district, and the date;
such generous bowls, As Thrasea and Helvidius, patriot souls!
While crowned with flowers, in sacred pomp, they lay, To FREEDOM quaffed, on Brutus' natal day.
Before your patron, cups of price are placed, Amber and gold, with rows of beryls graced :
Cups, you can only at a distance view, And never trusted to such guests as you !
Or, if they be,-a faithful slave attends, To count the gems, and watch your fingers' ends.
You'll pardon him ;
but lo!
a jasper there,
Of matchless worth, which justifies his care :
For Virro, like his brother peers, of late, Has stripped his fingers to adorn his plate;
And jewels now emblaze the festive board, }
Which decked with nobler grace the hero's sword, Whom Dido prized, above the Libyan lord.
From such he drinks:
to you the slaves allot
The Beneventine cobbler's four-lugged pot, A fragment, a mere shard, of little worth, But to be trucked for matches-and so forth.
If Virro's veins with indigestion glow, They bring him water cooled in Scythian snow :
What!
did I late complain a different wine Fell to thy share ?
A different water's thine !
Getulian slaves your vile potations pour, Or the coarse paws of some huge, raw-honed Moor, Whose hideous form the stoutest would affray, If met, by moonlight, near the Latian way :
On him a youth, the flower of Asia, waits, So dearly purchased, that the joint estates Of Tullus, Ancus, would not yield the sum, Nor all the wealth-of all the kings of Rome!
Bear this in mind ;
and when the cup you need, Look to your own Getulian Ganymede ;
A page who cost so much, will ne'er, be sure, Come at your beck :
he heeds not, he, the poor ;
But, of his youth and beauty justly vain, Trips by them, with indifference or disdain.
If called, he hears not, or, with rage inflamed— Indignant, that his services are claimed By an old client, who, ye gods !
commands, And sits at ease, while his superior stands !
Such proud, audacious minions swarm in Rome, And trample on the poor, where'er they come.
Mark with what insolence another thrusts
Before your plate th' impenetrable crusts, Black, mouldy fragments, which defy the saw, The mere despair of every aching jaw!
While manchets, of the finest flour, are set Before your lord ;
but be you mindful, yet, And taste not, touch not :
of the pantler stand
In trembling awe, and check your desperate hand-
Yet, should you dare-a slave springs forth, to wrest The sacred morsel from you.
" Saucy guest," He frowns, and mutters, " wilt thou ne'er divine What's for thy patron's tooth, and what for thine ?
Never take notice from what tray thou'rt fed, Nor know the colour of thy proper bread ?
"Was it for this, the baffled client cries, The tears indignant starting from his eyes, Was it for this I left my wife ere day, And up the bleak Esquilian urged my way, While the wind howled, the hail-storm beat amain, And my cloak smoked beneath the driving rain!
But lo, a lobster introduced in state, Stretches, enormous, o'er the bending plate!
Proud of a length of tail, he seems to eye
The humbler guests with scorn, as, towering by, He takes the place of honour at the board, And crowned with costly pickles, greets his lord !
A crab is yours, ill garnished and ill fed, With half an egg—a supper for the dead!
He pours Venafran oil upon his fish, While the stale coleworts, in your wooden dish, Stink of the lamp ;
for such to you is thrown, Such rancid grease, as Afric sends to town ;
So strong !
that when her factors seek the bath, All wind, and all avoid, the noisome path ;
So pestilent!
that her own serpents fly
The horrid stench, or meet it but to die.
See!
a sur-mullet now before him set, From Corsica, or isles more distant yet, Brought post to Rome ;
since Ostia's shores no more Supply the insatiate glutton, as of yore, Thinned by the net, whose everlasting throw Allows no Tuscan fish in peace to grow.
Still luxury yawns, unfilled ;
the nations rise, And ransack all their coasts for fresh supplies :
Thence come your presents;
thence, as rumour tells, The dainties Lenas buys, Aurelia sells.
A lamprey next, from the Sicilian straits, Of more than common size, on Virro waits--
For oft as Auster seeks his cave, and flings
The cumbrous moisture from his dripping wings, Forth flies the daring fisher, lured by gain, While rocks oppose, and whirlpools threat in vain.
To you an eel is brought, whose slender make Speaks him a famished cousin to the snake ;
Or some frost-bitten pike, who, day by day, Through half the city's ordure sucked his way!
Would Virro deign to hear me, I could give A few brief hints :
—We look not to receive What Seneca, what Cotta used to send, What the good Piso, to an humble friend ;
— For bounty once preferred a fairer claim, Than birth or power, to honourable fame :
No ;
all we ask (and you may this afford)
Is, simply, civil treatment at your hoard ;
Indulge us here ;
and be, like numbers more, Rich to yourself, to your dependants poor!
Vain hope!
Near him a goose's liver lies;
A capon, equal to a goose in size ;
A boar, too, smokes, like that which fell, of old, By the famed hero, with the locks of gold.
Last, if the spring its genial influence shed, And welcome thunders call them from their bed, Large mushrooms enter :
ravished with their size, " 0 Libya, keep thy grain ! "
Alledius cries, " And bid thy oxen to their stalls retreat, Nor, while thou grow'st such mushrooms, think of wheat!
"Meanwhile, to put your patience to the test, Lo!
the spruce carver, to his task addrest, Skips, like a harlequin, from place to place, And waves his knife with pantomimic grace, Till every dish be ranged, and every joint Severed, by nicest rules, from point to point.
You think this folly—'tis a simple thought-
To such perfection, now, is carving brought, That different gestures, by our curious men, Are used for different dishes, hare and hen.
But, think what e'er you may, your comments spare ;
For should you, like a free-born Roman, dare To hint your thoughts, forth springs some sturdy groom, And drags you straight, heels foremost, from the room!
Does Virro ever pledge you ?
ever sip
The liquor touched by your unhallowed lip ?
Or is there one of all your tribe so free, So desperate, as to say—" Sir, drink to me ? " 0, there is much, that never can be spoke
By a poor client in a threadbare cloak !
But should some godlike man, more kind than fate, Some god, present you with a knight's estate, Heavens, what a change !
how infinitely dear Would Trebius then become!
How great appear, From nothing !
Virro, so reserved of late, Grows quite familiar :
"
Brother, send your plate, " Dear brother Trebius!
you were wont to say
You liked this trail, I think-Oblige me, pray."- O Riches!—this " dear brother " is your own,
To you this friendship, this respect is shown.
But would you now your patron's patron be ?
Let no young Trebius wanton round your knee, No Trebia, none :
a barren wife procures
The kindest, truest friends!
such then be yours.-
Yet, should she breed, and, to augment your joys, Pour in your lap, at once, three bouncing boys, Virro will still, so you be wealthy, deign To toy and prattle with the lisping train ;
Will have his pockets too with farthings stored, And when the sweet young rogues approach his board, Bring out his pretty corslets for the breast, His nuts, and apples, for each coaxing guest.
You champ on spongy toadstools, hateful treat!
Fearful of poison in each bit you eat:
He feasts secure on mushrooms, fine as those Which Claudius, for his special eating, chose, Till one more fine, provided by his wife, Finished at once his feasting, and his life!
Apples, as fragrant, and as bright of hue, As those which in Alcinoiis' gardens grew, Mellowed by constant sunshine ;
or as those, Which graced the Hesperides, in burnished rows;
Apples, which you may smell, but never taste, Before your lord and his great friends are placed :
While you enjoy mere windfalls, such stale fruit, As serves to mortify the raw recruit, When, armed with helm and shield, the lance he throws, And trembles at the shaggy master's blows.
You think, perhaps, that Virro treats so ill To save his gold :
no, 'tis to vex you still:
For, say, what comedy such mirth can raise, As hunger, tortured thus a thousand ways ?
No ;
(if you know it not,) 'tis to excite
Your rage, your frenzy, for his mere delight;
'Tis to compel you all your gall to show, And gnash your teeth in agonies of woe.
You deem yourself, (such pride inflates your breast,) Forsooth, a freeman, and your patron's guest ;
He thinks you a vile slave, drawn, by the smell
Of his warm kitchen, there;
and he thinks well :
For who so low, so wretched as to bear Such treatment twice, whose fortune 'twas to wear The golden boss;
nay, to whose humbler lot, The poor man's ensign fell, the leathern knot!
Your palate still beguiles you :
Ah, how nice
That smoking haunch !
NOW we shall have a slice!
Now that half hare is coming !
NOW a bit
Of that young pullet!
now—and thus you sit, Thumbing your bread in silence ;
watching still, For what has never reached you, never will!
I
No more of freedom-!
'tis a vain pretence :
Your patron treats you like a man of sense :
For, if you can, without a murmur, bear, You well deserve the insults which you share.
Anon, like voluntary slaves, you 'll throw Your humbled necks beneath the oppressor's blow, Nay, with bare backs, solicit to be beat, And merit SUCH A FRIEND, and SUCH A TREAT !YES, I believe that CHASTITY was known, And prized on earth, while Saturn filled the throne ;
When rocks a bleak and scanty shelter gave, When sheep and shepherds thronged one common cave, And when the mountain wife her couch bestrewed With skins of beasts, joint tenants of the wood, And reeds, and leaves plucked from the neighbouring tree :
—
A woman, Cynthia, far unlike to thee, Or thee, weak child of fondness and of fears, Whose eyes a sparrow's death suffused with tears :
But strong, and reaching to her burly brood Her big-swollen breasts, replete with wholesome food, And rougher than her husband, gorged with mast, And frequent belching from the coarse repast.
For when the world was new, the race that broke, Unfathered, from the soil or opening oak, Lived most unlike the men of later times, The puling brood of follies and of crimes.
Haply some trace of Chastity remained, While Jove, but Jove as yet unbearded, reigned;
Before the Greek bound, by another's head, His doubtful faith ;
or men, of theft in dread, Had learned their herbs and fruitage to immure, But all was unenclosed, and all secure !
At length Astrea, from these confines driven, Regained by slow degrees her native heaven ;
With her retired her sister in disgust, And left the world to rapine, and to lust.
'
Tis not a practice, friend, of recent date, But old, established, and inveterate, To climb another's couch, and boldly slight
The sacred Genius of the nuptial rite :
All other crimes the Age of Iron curst;
But that of Silver saw adulterers first.
Yet thou, it seems, art eager to engage
Thy witless neck, in this degenerate age!
Even now, thy hair the modish curl is taught, By master-hands ;
even now, the ring is bought;
Even now-thou once, Ursidius, hadst thy wits, But thus to talk of wiving !—O, these fits !
What more than madness has thy soul possest ?
What snakes, what Furies, agitate thy breast?
Heavens!
wilt thou tamely drag the galling chain, While hemp is to be bought, while knives remain?
While windows woo thee so divinely high, And Tiber and the Æmilian bridge are nigh ?—" 0, but the law," thou criest, " the Julian law, Will keep my destined wife from every flaw;
Besides, I die for heirs."
Good!
and for those, Wilt thou the turtle and the turbot lose, And all the dainties, which the flatterer, still Heaps on the childless, to secure his Will ?
But what will hence impossible be held, If thou, old friend, to wedlock art impelled ?
If thou, the veriest debauchee in town, With whom wives, widows, every thing went down, Shouldst stretch the unsuspecting neck, and poke Thy foolish nose into the marriage yoke ?
Thou, famed for scapes, and, by the trembling wife, Thrust in a chest so oft, to save thy life !
—But what!
Ursidius hopes a mate to gain, Frugal, and chaste, and of the good old strain :
Alas, he's frantic!
ope a vein with speed,
And bleed him copiously, good doctor, bleed.
Jewel of men !
thy knees to Jove incline, And let a heifer fall at Juno's shrine, If thy researches for a wife be blest, With one, who is notneed I speak the rest ?
Ah !
few the matrons
Ceres now can find,
Her hallowed fillets, with chaste hands, to bind ;
Few whom their fathers with their lips can trust, So strong their filial kisses smack of lust!
Go then, prepare to bring your mistress home, And crown your doors with garlands, ere she come.-
But will one man suffice, methinks, you cry, For all her wants and wishes ?
Will one eye !
And yet there runs, 'tis said, a wondrous tale, Of some pure maid, who lives-in some lone vale.
There she MAY live ;
but let the phoenix, placed At Gabii or Fidense, prove as chaste so As at her father's farm!
—Yet who will swear, That nought is done in night and silence there ?
Time was, when Jupiter and Mars, we're told, With many a nymph in woods and caves made bold;
}
And still, perhaps, they may not be too old.
Survey our public places;
see you there One woman worthy of your serious care ?
See you, through all the crowded benches, one
Whom you might take securely for your own ?—
Lo !
while Bathyllus, with his flexile limbs, Acts Leda, and through every posture swims, Tuccia delights to realize the play, And in lascivious trances melts away;
While rustic Thymelè, with curious eye, Marks the quick pant, the lingering, deep-drawn sigh, And while her cheeks with burning blushes glow, Learns this-learns all the city matrons know.
Others, when of the theatres bereft, When nothing but the wrangling bar is left, In the long tedious months which interpose 'Twixt the Cybelian and Plebeian shows, Sicken for action, and assume the airs, The mask and thyrsus, of their favourite players.
—Midst peals of mirth, see Urbicus advance, (Poor Ælia's choice,) and, in a wanton dance, Burlesque Autonoë's woes !
the rich engage
In higher frolics, and defraud the stage ;
Take from Chrysogonus the power to sing, Loose, at vast prices, the comedian's ring, Tempt the tragedian-but I see you moved-
Heavens!
dreamed you that QUINTILIAN would be loved!
Then hie thee, Lentulus, and boldly wed, That the chaste partner of thy fruitful bed May kindly single from this motley race Some sturdy Glaphyrus, thy brows to grace :
Haste ;
in the narrow streets long scaffolds raise, And deck thy portals with triumphant bays ;
That, in thy heir, as swathed in state he lies, The guests may trace Mirmillo's nose and eyes!
Hippia, who shared a rich patrician's bed, To Egypt with a gladiator fled, While rank Canopus eyed, with strong disgust, This ranker specimen of Roman lust.
Without one pang, the profligate resigned Her husband, sister, sire ;
gave to the wind Her children's tears ;
yea, tore herself away, (To strike you more,)—from PARIS and the PLAY !
And though, in affluence born, her infant head Had pressed the down of an embroidered bed, She braved the deep, (she long had braved her fame ;
But this is little-to the courtly dame,) And, with undaunted breast, the changes bore Of many a sea, the swelling and the roar.
Have they an honest call, such ills to bear ?
Cold shiverings seize them, and they shrink with fear;
But set illicit pleasure in their eye, Onward they rush, and every toil defy !
Summoned by duty, to attend her lord, How, cries the lady, can I get on board ?
How bear the dizzy motion ?
how the smell ?
140 But-when the adulterer calls her, all is well!
She roams the deck, with pleasure ever new, Tugs at the ropes, and messes with the crew;
But with her husband—O, how changed the case!
Sick !
sick !
she cries, and vomits in his face.
But by what youthful charms, what shape, what air, Was Hippia won, the opprobrious name to bear Of FENCER'S TRULL?
The wanton well might dote !
For the sweet Sergius long had scraped his throat, Long looked for leave to quit the public stage, Maimed in his limbs, and verging now to age.
Add, that his face was battered and decayed ;
The helmet on his brow huge galls had made, A wen deformed his nose, of monstrous size, And sharp rheum trickled from his bloodshot eyes :
But then he was a SWORDSMAN !
that alone Made every charm and every grace his own ;
That made him dearer than her nuptial vows, Dearer than country, sister, children, spouse.­
'Tis BLOOD THEY LOVE :
Let Sergius quit the sword, And he'll appear, at once,-so like her lord!
Start you at wrongs that touch a private name, At Hippia's lewdness, and Veiento's shame ?
Turn to the rivals of the immortal Powers, And mark how like their fortunes are to ours !
Claudius had scarce begun his eyes to close, Ere from his pillow Messalina rose ;
(Accustomed long the bed of state to slight For the coarse mattress, and the hood of night;
)
And with one maid, and her dark hair concealed Beneath a yellow tire, a strumpet veiled !
She slipt into the stews, unseen, unknown, And hired a cell, yet reeking, for her own.
There, flinging off her dress, the imperial whore Stood, with bare breasts and gilded, at the door, And showed, Britannicus, to all who came, The womb that bore thee, in Lycisca's name !
Allured the passers by with many a wile, And asked her price, and took it, with a smile.
And when the hour of business now was spent, And all the trulls dismissed, repining went;
Yet what she could, she did;
slowly she past, And saw her man, and shut her cell, the last, -Still raging with the fever of desire, Her veins all turgid, and her blood all fire, With joyless pace, the imperial couch she sought, And to her happy spouse (yet slumbering) brought Cheeks rank with sweat, limbs drenched with poisonous dews, The steam of lamps, and odour of the stews !
'Twere long to tell what philters they provide, What drugs, to set a son-in-law aside.
Women, in judgment weak, in feeling strong, By every gust of passion borne along, Act, in their fits, such crimes, that, to be just, The least pernicious of their sins is lust.
But why's Cesennia then, you say, adored, And styled the first of women, by her lord ?
Because she brought him thousands :
such the price
It cost the lady to be free from vice !—
Not for her charms the wounded lover pined, Nor felt the flame which fires the ardent mind, Plutus, not Cupid, touched his sordid heart;
And 'twas her dower that winged the unerring dart.
She brought enough her liberty to buy, And tip the wink before her husband's eye.
A wealthy wanton, to a miser wed, Has all the license of a widowed bed.
But yet, Sertorius what I say disproves, For though his Bibula is poor, he loves.
True !
but examine him ;
and, on my life, You 'll find he loves the beauty, not the wife.
Let but a wrinkle on her forehead rise, And time obscure the lustre of her eyes;
Let but the moisture leave her flaccid skin, And her teeth blacken, and her cheeks grow thin ;
And you shall hear the insulting freedman say, " Pack up your trumpery, madam, and away !
Nay, bustle, bustle;
here you give offence, With snivelling night and day ;
-take your nose hence !
"
—But, ere that hour arrive, she reigns indeed!
Shepherds, and sheep of Canusinian breed, Falernian vineyards, (trifles these,) she craves, And store of boys, and troops of country slaves ;
Briefly, for all her neighbour has, she sighs, And plagues her doting husband, till he buys.
In winter, when the merchant fears to roam, And snow confines the shivering crew at home ;
She ransacks every shop for precious ware, Here cheapens myrrh and crystal vases ;
there, That far-famed gem which Berenice wore, The hire of incest, and thence valued more ;
A brothers present, in that barbarous State, Where kings the sabbath, barefoot, celebrate;
And old indulgence grants a length of life To hogs, that fatten fearless of the knife.
What!
and is none of all this numerous herd Worthy your choice ?
not one, to be preferred ?
Suppose her nobly born, young, rich, and fair, And (though a coal-black swan be far less rare) Chaste as the Sabine wives, who rushed between
The kindred hosts, and closed the unnatural scene ;
Yet who could bear to lead an humbled life, Cursed with that veriest plague, a faultless wife!-
Some simple rustic at Venusium bred, O let me, rather than Cornelia, wed, If, to great virtues, greater pride she join, And count her ancestors as current coin.
Take back, for mercy's sake, thy Hannibal!
Away with vanquished Syphax, camp and all !
Troop, with the whole of Carthage!
I'd be free From all this pageantry of worth-and thee."
0 let, Apollo, let my children live, And thou, Diana, pity, and forgive ;
" Amphion cries ;
" they, they are guiltless all:
The mother sinned, let then the mother fall."
In vain he cries ;
Apollo bends his bow, And, with the children, lays the father low ?
They fell;
while Niobe aspired to place Her birth and blood above Latona's race;
And boast her womb,-too fruitful, to be named With that WHITE Sow, for thirty sucklings famed.
Beauty and worth are purchased much too dear, If a wife force them hourly on your ear ;
For, say, what pleasure can you hope to find, Even in this boast, this phoenix of her kind, If, warped by pride, on all around she lour, And in your cup more gall than honey pour ?
Ah!
who so blindly wedded to the state, As not to shrink from such a perfect mate, Of every virtue feel the oppressive weight, And curse the worth he loves, seven hours in eight ?
Some faults, though small, no husband yet can bear :
'Tis now the nauseous cant, that none is fair, Unless her thoughts in Attic terms she dress;
A mere Cecropian of a Sulmoness !
All now is Greek :
in Greek their souls they pour, In Greek their fears, hopes, joys ;
-what would you more ?
In Greek they clasp their lovers.
We allow These fooleries to girls :
but thou, 0 thou, Who tremblest on the verge of eighty-eight, To Greek it still !—'tis, now, a day too late.
Fob !
how it savours of the dregs of lust, When an old bag, whose blandishments disgust, Affects the infant lisp, the girlish squeak, And mumbles out, " My life!
My soul ! " in Greek!
Words, which the secret sheets alone should hear, But which s'he trumpets in the public car.
And words, indeed, have power-But though she woo
In softer strains than e'er Carpophorus knew, Her wrinkles still employ her favourite's cares ;
And while she murmurs love, he counts her years!
But tell me ;
—if thou CANST NOT love a wife, Made thine by every tie, and thine for life, Why wed at all ?
why waste the wine and cakes,
The queasy-stomached guest, at parting, takes ?
And the rich present, which the bridal right Claims for the favours of the happy night ?
The charger, where, triumphantly inscrolled, The Dacian Hero shines in current gold!
If thou CANST love, and thy besotted mind Is, so uxoriously, to one inclined, Then bow thy neck, and with submissive air Receive the yoke-thou must for ever wear.
To a fond spouse a wife no mercy shows :
-
Though warmed with equal fires, she mocks his woes, And triumphs in his spoils :
her wayward will Defeats his bliss, and turns his good to ill!
Nought must be given, if she opposes;
nought, If she opposes, must be sold or bought;
She tells him where to love, and where to hate, Shuts out the ancient friend, whose beard his gate }
Knew, from its downy to its hoary state:
)
And when pimps, parasites, of all degrees, Have power to will their fortunes as they please, She dictates his ;
and impudently dares
To name his very rivals for his heirs !"
Go, crucify that slave."
For what offence ?
Who the accuser ?
Where the evidence ?
For when the life of MAN is in debate, No time can be too long, no care too great ;
Hear all, weigh all with caution, I advise­ "
Thou sniveller!
is a slave a MAN ? " she cries.
He's innocent!
be 't so :
—'tis my command, My will;
let that, sir, for a reason stand.
"Thus the virago triumphs, thus she reigns :
Anon she sickens of her first domains, And seeks for new ;
husband on husband takes, Till of her bridal veil one rent she makes.
Again she tires, again for change she burns,
And to the bed she lately left returns, While the fresh garlands, and uufaded boughs, Yet deck the portal of her wondering spouse.
Thus swells the list ;
EIGHT HUSBANDS IN FIVE YEARS :
A rare inscription for their sepulchres !
While your wife's mother lives, expect no peace.
She teaches her, with savage joy, to fleece A bankrupt spouse :
kind creature!
she befriends
The lover's hopes, and, when her daughter sends
An answer to his prayer, the style inspects, Softens the cruel, and the wrong corrects :
Experienced bawd !
she blinds, or bribes all eyes, And brings the adulterer, in despite of spies.
And now the farce begins ;
the lady falls "
Sick, sick, oh !
sick ;
" and for the doctor calls :
Sweltering she lies till the dull visit's o'er, While the rank lecher, at the closet door Lurking in silence, maddens with delay, And in his own impatience melts away.
Nor count it strange :
What mother e'er was known
To teach severer morals than her own ?—
No ;
—with their daughters' lusts they swell their stores, And thrive as bawds, when out of date as whores!
Women support the BAR :
they love the law, And raise litigious questions for a straw ;
They meet in private, and prepare the Bill, Draw up the Instructions with a lawyer's skill, Suggest to Celsus where the merits lie, And dictate points for statement or reply.
Nay more, they FENCE !
who has not marked their oil,
Their purple rugs, for this preposterous toil ?
Room for the lady—lo!
she seeks the list, And fiercely tilts at her antagonist, A post!
which, with her buckler, she provokes,
And bores and batters with repeated strokes;
Till all the fencer's art can do she shows,
And the glad master interrupts her blows.
O worthy, sure, to head those wanton dames, Who foot it naked at the Floral games ;
Unless, with nobler daring, she aspire, And tempt the arena's bloody field-for hire !
What sense of shame is to that female known,
Who envies our pursuits, and hates her own ?
Yet would she not, though proud in arms to shine, (True woman still, her sex for ours resign ;
For there's a thing she loves beyond compare, And we, alas !
have no advantage there.
-Heavens!
with what glee a husband must behold
His wife's accoutrements, in public, sold ;
And auctioneers displaying to the throng Her crest, her belt, her gauntlet, and her thong!
Or, if in wilder frolics she engage, And take her private lessons for the stage, Then three-fold rapture must expand his breast, To see her greaves " a-going," with the rest.
Yet these are they, the tender souls!
who sweat
In muslin, and in silk expire with heat.- Mark, with what force, as the full blow descends,
She thunders " hah ! " again, how low she bends
Beneath the opposer's stroke ;
how firm she rests, Poised on her hams, and every step contests:
How close tucked up for fight, behind, before, Then laugh-to see her squat, when all is o'er!
Daughters of Lepidus, and Gurges old, And blind Metellus, did ye e'er behold Asylla (though a fencer's trull confest)
Tilt at a stake, thus impudently drest!
'
Tis night;
yet hope no slumbers with your wife ;
The nuptial bed is still the scene of strife :
There lives the keen debate, the clamorous brawl, And quiet " never comes, that comes to all."
Fierce as a tigress plundered of her young, Rage fires her breast, and loosens all her tongue, When, conscious of her guilt, she feigns to groan, And chides your loose amours, to hide her own ;
Storms at the scandal of your baser flames, And weeps her injuries from imagined names, With tears that, marshalled, at their station stand, And flow impassioned, as she gives command.
You think those showers her true affection prove, And deem yourself-so happy in her love!
With fond caresses strive her heart to cheer, And from her eyelids suck the starting tear:
-But could you now examine the scrutore
Of this most loving, this most jealous whore, What amorous lays, what letters would you see, Proofs, damning proofs, of her sincerity !
But these are doubtful-Put a clearer case :
Suppose her taken in a loose embrace, A slave's or knight's.
Now, my Quintilian, come, And fashion an excuse.
What!
you are dumb ?
Then, let the lady speak.
" Was't not agreed The MAN might please himself? " It was;
proceed. "
Then, so may I"—O, Jupiter! " No oath :
MAN is a general term, and takes in both."
When once surprised, the sex all shame forego ;
And more audacious, as more guilty, grow.
Whence shall these prodigies of vice be traced ?
From wealth, my friend.
Our matrons then were chaste, When days of labour, nights of short repose, Hands still employed the Tuscan wool to tose, Their husbands armed, and anxious for the State, And Carthage hovering near the Colline gate, Conspired to keep all thoughts of ill aloof, And banished vice far from their lowly roof.
Now, all the evils of long peace are ours ;
Luxury, more terrible than hostile powers, Her baleful influence wide around has hurled, And well avenged the subjugated world!
-Since Poverty, our better Genius, fled, Vice, like a deluge, o'er the State has spread.
Now, shame to Rome !
in every street are found
The essenced Sybarite, with roses crowned, The gay Miletan, and the Tarentine, Lewd, petulant, and reeling ripe with wine !
Wealth first, the ready pander to all sin, Brought foreign manners, foreign vices in ;
Enervate wealth, and with seductive art, Sapped every bomebred virtue of the heart;
Yes, every :
-for what cares the drunken dame, (Take head or tail, to her 'tis just the same,) Who, at deep midnight, on fat oysters sups, And froths with unguents her Falernian cups ;
Who swallows oceans, till the tables rise, And double lustres dance before her eyes!
Thus flushed, conceive, as Tullia homeward goes, With what contempt she tosses up her nose At Chastity's hoar fane !
what impious jeers Collatia pours in Maura's tingling ears !
Here stop their litters, here they all alight, And squat together in the goddess' sight :
-
You pass, aroused at dawn your court to pay, The loathsome scene of their licentious play.
Who knows not now, my friend, the secret rites
Of the GOOD GODDESS ;
when the dance excites
The boiling blood ;
when, to distraction wound, By wine, and music's stimulating sound, The mænads of Priapus, with wild air, Howl horrible, and toss their flowing hair !
Then, how the wine at every pore o'erflows!
How the eye sparkles!
how the bosom glows!
How the cheek burns,!
and, as the passions rise, How the strong feeling bursts in eager cries!-
Saufeia now springs forth, and tries a fall
With the town prostitutes, and throws them all;
But yields, herself, to Medullina, known For parts, and powers, superior to her own.
Maids, mistresses, alike the contest share, And 'tis not always birth that triumphs there.
Nothing is feigned in this accursed game :
'Tis genuine all;
and such as would inflame The frozen age of Priam, and inspire The ruptured, bedrid Nestor with desire.
Stung with their mimic feats, a hollow groan
Of lust breaks forth ;
the sex, the sex is shown !
And one loud yell re-echoes through the den, " Now, now, 'tis lawful!
now admit the men ! "
There's none arrived. " Not yet!
then scour the street, And bring us quickly, here, the first you meet."
There's none abroad. " Then fetch our slaves."
They're gone. " Then hire a waterman."
There's none.
" Not one ! "— Nature's strong barrier scarcely now restrains
The baffled fury in their boiling veins !
And would to heaven our ancient rites were free!- But Africa and India, earth and sea, Have heard, what singing-wench produced his ware, Vast as two Auti-Catos, there, even there, Where the he-mouse, in reverence, lies concealed, And every picture of a male is veiled.
And who was THEN a scoffer ?
who despised
The simple rites by infant Rome devised, The wooden bowl of pious Numa's day, The coarse brown dish, and pot of homely clay ?
Now, woe the while !
religion's in its wane ;
And daring Clodii swarm in every fane.
I hear, old friends, I hear you :
"
Make all sure :
Let spies surround her, and let bolts secure."
But who shall KEEP the KEEPERS ?
Wives contemn
Our poor precautions, and begin with THEM.
Lust is the master passion ;
it inflames, Alike, both high and low;
alike, the dames, Who, on tall Syrians' necks, their pomp display, And those who pick, on foot, their miry way.
Whene'er Ogulnia to the Circus goes, To emulate the rich, she hires her clothes, Hires followers, friends, and cushions ;
hires a chair, A nurse, and a trim girl, with golden hair, To slip her billets :
-prodigal and poor, She wastes the wreck of her paternal store
On smooth-faced wrestlers ;
wastes her little all, And strips her shivering mansion to the wall!
There's many a woman knows distress at home;
Not one who feels it, and, ere ruin come, To her small means conforms.
Taught by the ant, Men sometimes guard against the extreme of want, And stretch, though late, their providential fears,To food and raiment for their future years :
But women never see their wealth decay;
With lavish hands they scatter night and day, As if the gold, with vegetative power, Would spring afresh, and bloom from hour to hour;
As if the mass its present size would keep, And no expense reduce the eternal heap.
Others there are, who centre all their bliss
In the soft eunuch, and the beardless kiss:
They need not from his chin avert their face, Nor use abortive drugs, for his embrace.
But oh !
their joys run high, if be be formed,
When his full veins the fire of love has warmed ;
When every part's to full perfection reared, And nought of manhood wanting, but the beard.
But should the dame in music take delight, The public singer is disabled quite :
In vain the prætor guards him all be can ;
She slips the buckle, and enjoys her man.
Still in her hand his instrument is found, Thick set with gems, that shed a lustre round ;
Still o'er his lyre the ivory quill she flings, Still runs divisions on the trembling strings, The trembling strings, which the loved Hedymel Was wont to strike-so sweetly, and so well!
These still she holds, with these she soothes her woes, And kisses on the dear, dear wire bestows.
A noble matron of the Lamian line Inquired of Janus, (offering meal and wine,) If Pollio, at the Harmonic Games, would speed, And wear the oaken crown, the victor's meed!
What could she for a husband, more, have done, What for an only, an expiring son ?
Yes ;
for a harper, the besotted dame Approached the altar, reckless of her fame, And veiled her head, and, with a pious air, Followed the Aruspex through the form of prayer ;
And trembled, and turned pale, as he explored
The entrails, breathless for the fatal word !
But, tell me, father Janus, if you please, Tell me, most ancient of the deities, Is your attention to such suppliants given ?
If so-there is not much to do in heaven!
For a comedian, this consults your will, For a tragedian, that;
kept standing, still, By this eternal route, the wretched priest Feels his legs swell, and dies to be releast.
But let her rather sing, than roam the streets, And thrust herself in every crowd she meets ;
Chat with great generals, though her lord be there, With lawless eye, bold front, and bosom bare.
She, too, with curiosity o'erflows, And all the news of all the world she knows;
Knows what in Scythia, what in Thrace is done ;
The secrets of the step-dame and the son;
Who speeds, and who is jilted :
and can swear, }
Who made the widow pregnant, when and where, And what she said, and how she frolicked there.
-She first espied the star, whose baleful ray, O'er Parthia, and Armenia, shed dismay :
She watches at the gates, for news to come, And intercepts it, as it enters Rome;
Then, fraught with full intelligence, she flies Through every street, and, mingling truth with lies, Tells how Niphates bore down every mound, And poured his desolating flood around ;
How earth, convulsed, disclosed her caverns hoar, And cities trembled, and-were seen no more !
And yet this itch, though never to be cured, Is easier, than her cruelty, endured.
Should a poor neighbour's do, but discompose
Her rest a moment, wild with rage she grows;
" Ho! whips," she cries, " and flay that brute accurst;
" But flay that rascal there, who owns him, first."
Dangerous to meet while in these frantic airs,
And terrible to look at, she prepares
To bathe at night;
she issues her commands, And in long ranks forth march the obedient bands, With tubs, cloths, oils :
-for 'tis her dear delight To sweat in clamour, tumult, and affright.
When her tired arms refuse the balls to ply, And the lewd bath-keeper has rubbed her dry, She calls to mind each miserable guest, Long since with hunger, and with sleep opprest, And hurries home;
all glowing, all athirst, For wine, whole flasks of wine!
and swallows, first, Two quarts, to clear her stomach, and excite A ravenous, an unbounded appetite !
Huisch !
up it comes, good heavens !
meat, drink, and all, And flows in purple torrents round the hall;
Or a gilt ewer receives the foul contents, And poisons all the house with vinous scents.
So, dropt into a vat, a snake is said To drink and spew :
-the husband turns his head, Sick to the soul, from this disgusting scene, And struggles to suppress his rising spleen.
But she is more intolerable yet, Who plays the critic when at table set;
Calls Virgil charming, and attempts to prove Poor Dido right, in venturing all for love.
From Maro, and Masonides, she quotes
The striking passages, and, while she notes
Their beauties and defects, adjusts her scales, And accurately weighs which bard prevails.
The astonished guests sit mute :
grammarians yield, Loud rhetoricians, baffled, quit the field;
Even auctioneers and lawyers stand aghast, And not a woman speaks !
-So thick, and fast, The wordy shower descends, that you would swear A thousand bells were jangling in your ear, A thousand basins clattering.
Vex no more
Your trumpets and your timbrels, as of yore, To ease the labouring moon ;
her single yell Can drown their clangour, and dissolve the spell.
She lectures too in Ethics, and declaims On the CHIEF GOOD !-but, surely, she who aims
To seem too learn'd, should take the male array ;
A hog, due offering, to Sylvanus slay, And, with the Stoic's privilege, repair To farthing baths, and strip in public there!
Oh, never may the partner of my bed With subtleties of logic stuff her head ;
Nor whirl her rapid syllogisms around, Nor with imperfect enthymemes confound!
Enough for me, if common things she know, And boast the little learning schools bestow.
I hate the female pedagogue, who pores O'er her Palæmon hourly;
who explores All modes of speech, regardless of the sense, But tremblingly alive to mood and tense :
Who puzzles me with many an uncouth phrase, From some old canticle of Numa's days ;
Corrects her country friends, and cannot hear Her husband solecise without a sneer!
A woman stops at nothing, when she wears Rich emeralds round her neck, and in her ears Pearls of enormous size ;
these justify Her faults, and make all lawful in her eye.
Sure, of all ills with which mankind are curst, A wife who brings you money is the worst.
Behold !
her face a spectacle appears, Bloated, and foul, and plastered to the ears With viscous paste :
-the husband looks askew, And sticks his lips in this detested glue.
She meets the adulterer bathed, perfumed, and drest, But rots in filth at home, a very pest!
For him she breathes of nard ;
for him alone
She makes the sweets of Araby her own ;
For him, at length, she ventures to unease, Scales the first layer of roughcast from her face, And, while the maids to know her now begin, Clears, with that precious milk, her frowzy skin, For which, though exiled to the frozen main, She'd lead a drove of asses in her train!
But tell me yet;
this thing, thus daubed and oiled, Thus poulticed, plaistered, baked by turns and boiled, Thus with pomatums, ointments, lackered o'er, Is it a FACE, Ursidius, or a SORE ?'Tis worth a little labour, to survey
Our wives more near, and trace 'em through the day.
If, dreadful to relate!
the night foregone, The husband turned his back, or lay alone, All, all is lost;
the housekeeper is stripped, The tiremaid chidden, and the chairman whipped:
Rods, cords, and thongs avenge the master's sleep, And force the guiltless house to wake and weep.
There are, who hire a beadle by the year, To lash their servants round;
who, pleased to hear
The eternal thong, bid him lay on, while they, At perfect ease, the silkman's stores survey, Chat with their female gossips, or replace The cracked enamel on their treacherous face.
No respite yet :
-they leisurely hum o'er
The countless items of the day before, And bid him still lay on ;
till, faint with toil, He drops the scourge ;
when, with a rancorous smile, " Begone ! " they thunder in a horrid tone, " Now your accounts are settled, rogues, begone !
"But should she wish with nicer care to dress, And now the hour of assignation press, (Whether the adulterer for her coming wait In Isis' fane, to bawdry consecrate, Or in Lucullus' walks,) the house appears A true Sicilian court, all gloom and tears.
The wretched Psecas, for the whip prepared, With locks dishevelled, and with shoulders bared, Attempts her hair :
fire flashes from her eyes, And, " Strumpet!
why this curl so high ? " she cries.
Instant the lash, without remorse, is plied, And the blood stains her bosom, back, and side.
But why this fury?
—Is the girl to blame, If your air shocks you, or your features shame ?
Another, trembling, on the left prepares To open and arrange the straggling hairs
In ringlets trim :
meanwhile, the council meet:
And first the nurse, a personage discreet, Late from the toilet to the wheel removed, (The effect of time,) yet still of taste approved, Gives her opinion :
then the rest, in course, As age, or practice, lends their judgment force.
So warm they grow, and so much pains they take, You'd think her honour or her life at stake!
So high they build her head, such tiers on tiers, With wary hands, they pile, that she appears, Andromache, before :
-and what behind ?
A dwarf, a creature of a different kind.
-Meanwhile, engrossed by these important cares,
She thinks not on her lord's distrest affairs, Scarce on himself;
but leads a separate life, As if she were his neighbour, not his wife ?'
Or, but in this,-that all control she braves ;
Hates where he loves, and squanders where he saves.
Room for Bellona's frantic votaries!
room For Cybele's mad enthusiasts!
lo, they come!
A lusty semivir, whose part obscene, A broken shell has severed smooth and clean, A raw-boned, mitred priest, whom the whole choir Of curtailed priestlings reverence and admire, Enters, with his wild rout;
and bids the fair Of autumn, and its sultry blasts, beware, Unless she Instrate, with an hundred eggs, Her household straight :
-then, impudently begs Her cast-off clothes, that every plague they fear May enter them, and expiate all the year!
But lo!
another tribe !
at whose command, See her, in winter, near the Tiber stand, Break the thick ice, and, ere the sun appears, Plunge in the crashing eddy to the ears ;
Then, shivering from the keen and eager breeze, Crawl round the banks, on bare and bleeding knees.
Should milkwhite
Iö bid, from Meroë's isle She'd fetch the sunburnt waters of the Nile, To sprinkle in her fane ;
for she, it seems, Has heavenly visitations in her dreams-
Mark the pure soul, with whom the gods delight
To hold high converse at the noon of night !
For this she cherishes, above the rest, Her Iö's favourite priest, a knave protest, A holy hypocrite, who strolls abroad, With his Anubis, his dog-headed god !
Girt by a linen-clad, a bald-pate crew Of howling vagrants, who their cries renew In every street, as up and down they run, To find OSIRE, fit father to fit son !
He sues for pardon, when the liquorish dame Abstains not from the interdicted game
On high and solemn days ;
for great the crime, To stain the nuptial couch at such a time, And great the atonement due ;
—the silver snake, Abhorrent of the deed, was seen to quake !
Yet he prevails :
—Osiris hears his prayers, And, softened by a goose, the culprit spares.
Without her badge, a Jewess now draws near, And, trembling, begs a trifle in her ear.
No common personage !
she knows full well
The laws of Solyma, and she can tell
The dark decrees of heaven ;
a priestess she, An hierarch of the consecrated tree!
Moved by these claims thus modestly set forth, She gives her a few coins of little worth;
For Jews are moderate, and, for farthing fees, Will sell what fortune, or what dreams you please.
The prophetess dismissed, a Syrian sage Now enters, and explores the future page, In a dove's entrails :
there he sees exprest A youthful lover :
there, a rich bequest, From some kind dotard :
then a chick he takes,
And in its breast, and in a puppy's, rakes, And sometimes in— an infant's :
he will teach
The art to others, and, when taught, impeach !
But chiefly in Chaldeans she believes :
Whate'er they say, with reverence she receives, As if from Hammon's secret fount it came;
Since Delphi now, if we may credit fame, Gives no responses, and a long dark night Conceals the future hour from mortal sight.
Of these, the chief (such credit guilt obtains !)
Is he, who, banished oft, and oft in chains, Stands forth the veriest knave;
he who foretold
The death of Galba,—to his rival sold !
No juggler must for fame or profit hope, Who has not narrowly escaped the rope;
Begged hard for exile, and, by special grace, Obtained confinement in some desert place.-
To him your Tanaquil applies, in doubt How long her jaundiced mother may hold out;
But first, how long her husband :
next, inquires,
When she shall follow, to their funeral pyres, Her sisters, and her uncles ;
last, if fate Will kindly lengthen out the adulterer's date Beyond her own ;
-content, if he but live, And sure that heaven has nothing more to give!
Yet she may still be suffered ;
for, what woes
The louring aspect of old Saturn shows ;
Or in what sign bright Venus ought to rise, To shed her mildest influence from the skies ;
Or what fore-fated month to gain is given, And what to loss, (the mysteries of heaven,)
She knows not, nor pretends to know :
but flee
The dame, whose Manual of Astrology Still dangles at her side, smooth as chafed gum, And fretted by her everlasting thumb !—
Deep in the science now, she leaves her mate
To go, or stay;
but will not share his fate, Withheld by trines and sextiles ;
she will look, Before her chair be ordered, in the book, For the fit hour ;
an itching eye endure, Nor, till her scheme be raised, attempt the cure ;
Nay, languishing in bed, receive no meat, Till Petosyris bid her rise and eat.
The curse is universal:
high and low Are mad alike the future hour to know.
The rich consult a Babylonian seer, Skilled in the mysteries of either sphere;
Or a grey-headed priest, hired by the state, To watch the lightning, and to expiate.
The middle sort, a quack, at whose command
They lift the forehead, and make bare the hand ;
While the sly lecher in the table pries,
And claps it wantonly, with gloating eyes.
The poor apply to humbler cheats, still found Beside the Circus wall, or city mound ;
While she, whose neck no golden trinket bears,
To the dry ditch, or dolphin's tower, repairs, And anxiously inquires which she shall choose, The tapster, or old-clothes man ?
which refuse ?
Yet these the pangs of childbirth undergo,
And all the yearnings of a mother know ;
These, urged by want, assume the nurse's care, And learn to breed the children which they bear.
Those shun both toil and danger;
for, though sped, The wealthy dame is seldom brought to bed :
Such the dire power of drugs, and such the skill
They boast, to cause miscarriages at will!
Weep'st thou ?
0 fool!
the blest invention hail,
And give the potion, if the gossips fail ;
For, should thy wife her nine months' burthen bear, An Æthiop's offspring might thy fortunes heir ;
A sooty thing, fit only to affray, And, seen at morn, to poison all the day!
Supposititious breeds, the hope and joy Of fond, believing husbands, I pass by ;
The beggars' bantlings, spawned in open air, And left by some pond side, to perish there.-
From hence your Flamens, hence your Salians come ;
Your Scauri, chiefs and magistrates of Rome !
Fortune stands tittering by, in playful mood, And smiles, complacent, on the sprawling brood ;
Takes them all naked to her fostering arms, Feeds from her mouth, and in her bosom warms :
Then, to the mansions of the great she bears
The precious brats, and, for herself, prepares A secret farce ;
adopts them for her own :
And, when her nurslings are to manhood grown, She brings them forth, rejoiced to see them sped, And wealth and honours dropping on their head !
Some purchase charms, some, more pernicious still, Thessalian philters, to subdue the will Of an uxorious spouse, and make him bear Blows, insults, all a saucy wife can dare.
Hence that swift lapse to second childhood ;
hence
Those vapours which envelop every sense;
This strange forgetfulness from hour to hour ;
And well, if this be all :
-more fatal power, More terrible effects, the dose may have, And force you, like Caligula, to rave, When his Cæsonia squeezed into the bowl The dire excrescence of a new-dropt foal.-
Then Uproar rose ;
the universal chain Of Order snapped, and Anarchy's wild reign Came on apace, as if the queen of heaven Had fired the Thunderer, and to madness driven.
Thy mushroom, Agrippine ! was innocent, To this accursed draught;
that only sent One palsied, bedrid sot, with gummy eyes, And slavering lips, heels foremost to the skies :
This, to wild fury roused a bloody mind, And called for fire and sword;
this potion joined
In one promiscuous slaughter high and low, And levelled half the nation at a blow.
Such is the power of philters !
such the ill,
One sorceress can effect by wicked skill!
They hate their husband's spurious issue :
-this, If this were all, were not, perhaps, amiss :
But they go further ;
and 'tis now some time Since poisoning sons-in-law scarce seemed a crime.
Mark then, ye fatherless !
what I advise,
And trust, 0, trust no dainties, if you're wise :
Ye heirs to large estates !
touch not that fare, Your mother's fingers have been busy there ;
See!
it looks livid, swollen :
—O check your haste, And let your wary fosterfather taste, Whate’er she sets before you :
fear her meat, And be the first to look, the last to eat.
But this is fiction all!
I pass the bound Of Satire, and encroach on Tragic ground !
Deserting truth, I choose a fabled theme, And, like the buskined bards of Greece, declaim, In deep-mouthed tones, in swelling strains, on crimes As yet unknown to our Rutulian climes!
Would it were so !
but Pontia cries aloud, " No, I performed it."
See !
the fact's avowed­ " I mingled poison for my children, I;
'Twas found upon me, wherefore then deny ? " What, two at once, most barbarous viper !
two! " Nay, seven, had seven been mine:
believe it true!
"Now let us credit what the tragic stage Displays of Progne and Medea's rage ;
Crimes of dire name, which, disbelieved of yore, Become familiar, and revolt no more :
Those ancient dames in scenes of blood were bold, And wrought fell deeds, but not, as ours, for gold :
—
In every age, we view, with less surprise, Such horrors as from bursts of fury rise, When stormy passions, scorning all control, Rend the mad bosom, and unseat the soul.
As when impetuous winds, and driving rain, Mine some huge rock that overhangs the plain, The cumbrous mass descends with thundering force, And spreads resistless ruin in its course.
Curse on the woman, who reflects by fits, And in cold blood her cruelties commits !—
They see, upon the stage, the Grecian wife Redeeming with her own her husband's life ;
Yet, in her place, would willingly deprive
Their lords of breath to keep their dogs alive!
Abroad, at home, the Belides you meet, And Clytemnestras swarm in every street;
But here the difference lies :
-those bungling wives, With a blunt axe hacked out their husbands' lives;
While now, the deed is done with dexterous art, And a drugged bowl performs the axe's part.
Yet, if the husband, prescient of his fate, Have fortified his breast with mithridate, She baffles him e'en there, and has recourse
To the old weapon for a last resource.
YES, all the hopes of learning, 'tis confest, And all the patronage, on CÆSAR rest:
For he alone the drooping Nine regards-
When, now, our best, and most illustrious bards, Quit their ungrateful studies, and retire, Bagnios and bakehouses, for bread, to hire ;
With humbled views, a life of toil embrace, And deem a crier's business no disgrace ;
Since Clio, driven by hunger from the shade, Mixes in crowds, and bustles for a trade.
And truly, if (the bard's too frequent curse)
No coin be found in your Pierian purse, 'Twere not ill done to copy, for the nonce, Machæra, and turn auctioneer at once.
Hie, my poetic friend ;
in accents loud, Commend your precious lumber to the crowd, Old tubs, stools, presses, wrecks of many a chest, Paccius' damned plays, Thebes, Tereus, and the rest.-
And better so-than haunt the courts of law, And swear, for hire, to what you never saw :
Leave this resource to Cappadocian knights, To Gallogreeks, and such new-fangled wights, As want, or infamy, has chased from home, And driven, in barefoot multitudes, to Rome.
Come, my brave youths !-the genuine sons of rhyme, Who, in sweet numbers, couch the true sublime, Shall, from this hour, no more their fate accuse, Or stoop to pains unworthy of the Muse.
Come, my brave youths!
your tuneful labours ply, Secure of favour ;
lo!
the imperial eye 30 Looks round, attentive, on each rising bard, For worth to praise, for genius to reward!
But if for other patronage you look, And therefore write, and therefore swell your book, Quick, call for wood, and let the flames devour
The hapless produce of the studious hour;
Or lock it up, to moths and worms a prey, And break your pens, and fling your ink away :
—
Or pour it rather o'er your epic flights, Your battles, sieges, (fruit of sleepless nights,) Pour it, mistaken men, who rack your brains
In dungeons, cocklofts, for heroic strains ;
Who toil and sweat to purchase mere renown, A meagre statue, and an ivy crown !
Here bound your expectations :
for the great, Grown, wisely, covetous, have learned, of late, To praise, and ONLY praise, the high-wrought strain, As boys, the bird of Juno's glittering train.
Meanwhile those vigorous years, so fit to bear
The toils of agriculture, commerce, war, Spent in this idle trade, decline apace, And age, unthought of, stares you in the face :
— O then, appalled to find your better days
Have earned you nought but poverty and praise, At all your barren glories you repine, And curse, too late, the unavailing Nine !
Hear, now, what sneaking ways your patrons find, To save their darling gold :
-they pay in kind !
Verses, composed in every Muse's spite, To the starved bard they, in their turn, recite;
And, if they yield to Homer, let him know, ’Tis—that he lived a thousand years ago!
But if, inspired with genuine love of fame, A dry rehearsal only be your aim, The miser's breast with sudden warmth dilates, And lo !
he opes his triple-bolted gates ;
Nay, sends his clients to support your cause, And rouse the tardy audience to applause :
But will not spare one farthing to defray
The numerous charges of this glorious day, The desk where, throned in conscious pride, you sit, The joists and beams, the orchestra and the pit.
Still we persist;
plough the light sand, and sow Seed after seed, where none can ever grow :
Nay, should we, conscious of our fruitless pain, Strive to escape, we strive, alas ! in vain;
Long habit and the thirst of praise beset, And close us in the inextricable net.
The insatiate itch of scribbling, hateful pest, Creeps, like a tetter, through the human breast, Nor knows, nor hopes a cure ;
since years, which chill All other passions, but inflame the ill!
But HE, the bard of every age and clime, Of genius fruitful, ardent and sublime, Who, from the glowing mint of fancy, pours No spurious metal, fused from common ores, But gold, to matchless purity refined, And stamped with all the godhead in his mind;
He whom I feel, but want the power to paint, Springs from a soul impatient of restraint, And free from every care ;
a soul that loves The Muse's haunts, clear founts and shady groves.
Never, no never, did He wildly rave, And shake his thyrsus in the Aonian cave, Whom poverty kept sober, and the cries
Of a lean stomach, clamorous for supplies :
No ;
the wine circled briskly through the veins, When Horace poured his dithyrambic strains!-
What room for fancy, say, unless the mind, And all its thoughts, to poesy resigned, Be hurried with resistless force along, By the two kindred Powers of Wine and Song ! 0 ! 'tis the exclusive business of a breast Impetuous, uncontrolled,—not one distrest With household cares, to view the bright abodes, The steeds, the chariots, and the forms of gods :
And the fierce Fury, as her snakes she shook, And withered the Rutulian with a look !
Those snakes, had Virgil no Mæcenas found, Had dropt, in listless length, upon the ground ;
[sound.
And the still slumbering trump, groaned with no mortalYet we expect, from Lappa's tragic rage, Such scenes as graced, of old, the Athenian stage ;
Though he, poor man, from hand to mouth be fed, And driven to pawn his furniture for bread !
When Numitor is asked to serve a friend, " He cannot;
he is poor."
Yet he can send Rich presents to his mistress!
he can buy Tame lions, and find means to keep them high!
What then ?
the beasts are still the lightest charge ;
For your starved bards have maws so devilish large!
Stretched in his marble palace, at his ease, Lucan may write, and only ask to please ;
But what is this, if this be all you give, To Bassus and Serranus?
They must live !
When Statius fixed a morning, to recite His Thebaid to the town, with what delight
They flocked to hear !
with what fond rapture hung
On the sweet strains, made sweeter by his tongue!
Yet, while the seats rung with a general peal
Of boisterous praise, the bard had lacked a meal, Unless with Paris he had better sped, And trucked a virgin tragedy for bread.
Mirror of men !
he showers, with liberal hands,
On needy poets, honours and commands :
—
An actor's patronage a peer's outgoes, And what the last withholds, the first bestows!
-And will you still on Camerinus wait, And Bareas ?
will you still frequent the great ?
Ah, rather to the player your labours take, And at one lucky stroke your fortune make!
Yet envy not the man who earns hard bread
By tragedy :
the Muses' friends are fled !— Mæcenas, Proculeius, Fabius, gone, And Lentulus, and Cotta,—every one!
THEN worth was cherished, then the bard might toil, Secure of favour, o'er the midnight oil;
Then all December's revelries refuse, And give the festive moments to the Muse.
So fare the tuneful race :
but ampler gains Await, no doubt, the grave HISTORIANS’ pains!
More time, more study they require, and pile
Page upon page, heedless of bulk the while, Till, fact conjoined to fact with thought intense, The work is closed, at many a ream's expense!
Say now, what harvest was there ever found, What golden crop, from this long-laboured ground ?
'Tis barren all;
and one poor plodding scribe Gets more by framing pleas than all the tribe.
True :
—’tis a slothful breed, that, nurst in ease, Soft beds, and whispering shades, alone can please.
Say then, what gain the LAWYER'S toil affords, His sacks of papers, and his war of words ?
Heavens!
how he bellows in our tortured ears;
But then, then chiefly, when the client hears, Or one prepared, with vouchers, to attest Some desperate debt, more anxious than the rest, Twitches his elbow :
then, his passions rise !,
Then, forth he puffs the immeasurable lies From his swollen lungs!
then, the white foam appears, And, drivelling down his beard, his vest besmears!
Ask you the profit of this painful race ?
'Tis quickly summed :
Here, the joint fortunes place Of five-score lawyers ;
there, Lacerta's sole-
And that one charioteer's, shall poise the whole !
The Generals take their seats in regal wise.
You, my pale Ajax, watch the hour, and rise, In act to plead a trembling client's cause, Before Judge Jolthead—learned in the laws.
Now stretch your throat, unhappy man !
now raise
Your clamours, that, when hoarse, a bunch of bays, Stuck in your garret window, may declare, That some victorious pleader nestles there !
O glorious hour !
but what your fee, the while ?
A rope of shrivelled onions from the Nile, A rusty ham, a jar of broken sprats, And wine, the refuse of our country vats ;
Five flagons for four causes!
if you hold,
Though this indeed be rare, a piece of gold;
The brethren, as per contract, on you fall, And share the prize, solicitors and all!
Whate'er he asks, Æmilius may command, Though more of law be ours :
but lo !
there stand Before his gate, conspicuous from afar, Four stately steeds, yoked to a brazen car :
And the great pleader, looking wary round, On a fierce charger that disdains the ground, Levels his threatening spear, in act to throw, And seems to meditate no common blow.
Such arts as these, to beggary Matho brought, And such the ruin of Tongillus wrought, Who, with his troop of slaves, a draggled train, Annoyed the baths, of his huge oil-horn vain ;
Swept through the Forum, in a chair of state, To every auction,-villas, slaves, or plate;
And, trading on the credit of his dress, Cheapened whate'er he saw, though penniless!
And some, indeed, have thriven by tricks like these :
Purple and violet swell a lawyer's fees ;
Bustle and show above his means conduce
To business, and profusion proves of use.
The vice is universal :
Rome confounds
The wealthiest;
—prodigal beyond all bounds !
Could our old pleaders visit earth again, Tully himself would scarce a brief obtain, Unless his robe were purple, and a stone, Diamond or ruby, on his finger shone.
The wary plaintiff, ere a fee he gives, Inquires at what expense his counsel lives;
Has he eight slaves, ten followers ?
chairs to wait, And clients to precede his march in state ?
This Paulus knows full well, and, therefore, hires A ring to plead in ;
therefore, too, acquires More briefs than Cossus :
-preference not unsound, For how should eloquence in rags be found?
Who gives poor Basilus a cause of state ?
When, to avert a trembling culprit's fate, Shows he a weeping mother ?
or who heeds
How close he argues, and how well he pleads ?
Unhappy Basilus !-but he is wrong:
Would he procure subsistence by his tongue, Let him renounce the forum, and withdraw To Gaul, or Afric, the dry-nurse of law.
But Vectius, yet more desperate than the rest, Has opened (0 that adamantine breast!)
A RHETORIC school ;
where striplings rave and storm
At tyranny, through many a crowded form.-
The exercises lately, sitting, read, Standing, distract his miserable head, And every day and every hour affords
The selfsame subjects, in the selfsame words ;
Till, like bashed cabbage served for each repast, The repetition-kills the wretch at last!
Where the main jet of every question lies, And whence the chief objections may arise, All wish to know;
but none the price will pay. "
The price," retorts the scholar, " do you say !
What have I learned ? "
There go the master's pains, Because, forsooth, the Arcadian brute lacks brains !
And yet this oaf, every sixth morn, prepares
To split my head with Hannibal's affairs, While he debates at large, " Whether 'twere right "
To take advantage of the general fright, And march to Rome ;
or, by the storm alarmed, And all the elements against him armed, The dangerous expedition to delay, And lead his harassed troops some other way."
-Sick of the theme, which still returns, and still
The exhausted wretch exclaims, Ask what you will, I'll give it, so you on his sire prevail, To hear, thus oft, the booby's endless tale!
So Vectius speeds :
his brethren, wiser far, Have shut up school, and hurried to the bar.
Adieu the idle fooleries of Greece, The soporific drug, the golden fleece, The faithless husband, and the abandoned wife, And Æson, coddled to new light and life, A long adieu !
on more productive themes, On actual crimes, the sophist now declaims:
Thou too, my friend, would'st thou my counsel hear, Should'st free thyself from this ungrateful care ;
Lest all be lost, and thou reduced, poor sage, To want a tally in thy helpless age !
Bread still the lawyer earns;
but tell me yet, What your Chrysogonus and Pollio get, (The chief of rhetoricians,) though they teach Our youth of quality, THE ART OF SPEECH ?
Oh, no !
the great pursue a nobler end :
—
Five thousand on a bath they freely spend;
More on a portico, where, while it lours, They ride, and bid defiance to the showers.
Shall they, for brighter skies, at home remain,
Or dash their pampered mules through mud and rain ?
No :
let them pace beneath the stately roof, For there no mire can soil the shining hoof.
See next, on proud Numidian columns rise An eating-room, that fronts the eastern skies, And drinks the cooler sun.
Expensive these !
But, (cost whate'er they may,) the times to please, Sewers for arrangement of the board admired, And cooks of taste and skill must yet be hired.
Mid this extravagance, which knows no bounds, Quintilian gets, and hardly gets, ten pounds :
—
On education all is grudged as lost, And sons are still a father's lightest cost.
Whence has Quintilian, then, his vast estate ?
Urge not an instance of peculiar fate :
Perhaps, by luck.
The lucky, I admit, Have all advantages;
have beauty, wit, And wisdom, and high blood :
the lucky, May take, at will, the senatorial shoe ;
Be first-rate speakers, pleaders, every thing;
And, though they croak like frogs, be thought to sing.0, there's a difference, friend, beneath what sign We spring to light, or kindly or malign !
FORTUNE IS ALL :
She, as the fancy springs, Makes kings of pedants, and of pedants kings.
For, what were Tullius, and Ventidius, say, But great examples of the wondrous sway Of stars, whose mystic influence alone, Bestows, on captives triumphs, slaves a throne ?
He, then, is lucky;
and, amidst the clan, Ranks with the milk-white crow, or sable swan :
While all his hapless brethren count their gains, And execrate, too late, their fruitless pains.
Witness thy end, Thrasymachus !
and thine, Unblest Charinas !-Thou beheld'st him pine, Thou, Athens !
and would'st nought but bane bestow;
The only charity-thou seem'st to know !
Shades of our sires !
0, sacred be your rest,
And lightly lie the turf upon your breast!
Flowers round your urns breathe sweets beyond compare, And spring eternal shed its influence there !
You honoured tutors, now a slighted race, And gave them all a parent's power and place.
Achilles, grown a man, the lyre essayed
On his paternal hills, and, while he played, With trembling eyed the rod ;
-and yet, the tail Of the good Centaur, scarcely, then, could fail To force a smile :
such reverence now is rare, And boys with bibs strike Rufus on his chair, Fastidious Rufus, who, with critic rage, Arraigned the purity of Tully's page!
Enough of these.
Let the last wretched band, The poor GRAMMARIANS, say, what liberal hand Rewards their toil:
let learned Palæmon tell, Who proffers what his skill deserves so well.
Yet from this pittance, whatso'er it be, (Less, surely, than the rhetorician's fee,) The usher snips off something for his pains, And the purveyor nibbles what remains.
Courage, Palæmon!
be not over-nice, But suffer some abatement in your price;
As those who deal in rugs, will ask you high, And sink by pence, and half-pence, till you buy.
Yes, suffer this ;
while something's left to pay Your rising hours before the dawn of day, When e'en the labouring poor their slumbers take, And not a weaver, not a smith's awake :
While something's left to pay you for the stench
Of smouldering lamps, thick spread o'er every bench, Where ropy vapours Virgil's pages soil, And Horace looks one blot, all soot and oil!
Even then, the stipend thus reduced, thus small, Without a lawsuit, rarely comes at all.
Add yet, ye parents, add to the disgrace, And heap new hardships on this wretched race.
Make it a point that all, and every part, Of their own science, be possessed by heart;
That general history with our own they blend, And have all authors at their fingers' end :
Still ready to inform you, should you meet, And ask them at the bath, or in the street, who nursed Anchises ;
from what country came
The step-dame of Archemorus, what her name ;
How long Acestes flourished, and what store
Of generous wine the Phrygians from him bore-
Make it a point too, that, like ductile clay, They mould the tender mind, and day by day Bring out the form of Virtue;
that they prove A father to the youths, in care and love ;
And watch that no obscenities prevail-
And trust me, friend, even Argus' self might fail, The busy hands of school boys to espy, And the lewd fires which twinkle in their eye.
All this, and more, exact;
and, having found
The man you seek, say-
When the year comes round, We ’ll give thee for thy twelvemonths’ anxious pains, As much-as, IN AN HOUR, A FENCER GAINS !" YOUR ancient house! " No more.—I cannot see
The wondrous merits of a pedigree :
No, Ponticus ;
-nor of a proud display
Of smoky ancestors, in wax or clay ;
Æmilius, mounted on his car sublime, Curius, half wasted by the teeth of time, Corvinus, dwindled to a shapeless bust, And high-born Galba, crumbling into dust.
What boots it, on the LINEAL TREE to trace, Through many a branch, the founders of our race, Time-honoured chiefs ;
if, in their sight, we give A loose to vice, and like low villains live ?
Say, what avails it, that, on either hand, The stern Numantii, an illustrious band, Frown from the walls, if their degenerate race Waste the long night at dice, before their face?
If, staggering, to a drowsy bed they creep, At that prime hour when, starting from their sleep, Their sires the signal of the fight unfurled, And drew their legions forth, and won the world ?
Say, why should Fabius, of the Herculean name, To the GREAT ALTAR vaunt his lineal claim, If, softer than Euganean lambs, the youth, His wanton limbs, with Ætna’s pumice, smooth.
And shame his rough-hewn sires?
if greedy, vain,
If, a vile trafficker in secret bane, He .blast his wretched kindred with a bust, For public vengeance to-reduce to dust!
Fond man!
though all the heroes of your line Bedeck your halls, and round your galleries shine
In proud display ;
yet, take this truth from me, VIRTUE ALONE IS TRUE NOBILITY.
Set Cossus, Drusus, Paulus, then, in view, The bright example of their lives pursue;
Let these precede the statues of your race, And these, when Consul, of your rods take place.
O give me inborn worth !
Dare to be just, Firm to your word, and faithful to your trust :
These praises hear, at least deserve to hear, I grant your claim, and recognise the peer.
Hail!
from whatever stock you draw your birth, The son of Cossus, or the son of Earth, All hail!
in you, exulting Rome espies
Her guardian Power, her great Palladium rise ;
And shouts like Egypt, when her priests have found, A new Osiris, for the old one drowned!
But shall we call those noble, who disgrace
Their lineage, proud of an illustrious race?
Vain thought !-but thus, with many a taunting smile, The dwarf an Atlas, Moor a swan, we style ;
The crookbacked wench, Europa ;
and the hound, With age enfeebled, toothless, and unsound, That listless lies, and licks the lamps for food, Lord of the chase, and tyrant of the wood!
You, too, beware, lest Satire's piercing eye The slave of guilt through grandeur's blaze espy, And, drawing from your crime some sounding name, Declare at once your greatness, and your shame.
Ask you for whom this picture I design ?
Plautus, thy birth and folly make it thine.
Thou vaunt'st thy pedigree, on every side
To noble and imperial blood allied ;
As if thy honours by thyself were won, And thou hadst some illustrious action done.
To make the world believe thee Julia's heir, And not the offspring of some easy fair, Who, shivering in the wind, near yon dead wall, Plies her vile labour, and is all to all."
Away, away!
ye slaves of humblest birth, Ye dregs of Rome, ye nothings of the earth, Whose fathers who shall tell!
my ancient line Descends from Cecrops."
Man of blood divine !
Live, and enjoy the secret sweets which spring
In breasts, affined to so remote a king !—
Yet know, amid these " dregs," low grandeur's scorn, Will those be found whom arts and arms adorn :
Some, skilled to plead a noble blockhead's cause, And solve the dark enigmas of the laws ;
Some, who the Tigris' hostile banks explore, And plant our eagles on Batavia’s shore :
While thou, in mean, inglorious pleasure lost, With " Cecrops!
Cecrops ! " all thou hast to boast, Art a full brother to the crossway stone, Which clowns have chipped the head of Hermes on :
For 'tis no bar to kindred, that thy block
Is formed of flesh and blood, and theirs of rock.
Of beasts, great son of Troy, who vaunts the breed, Unless renowned for courage, strength, or speed ?
'Tis thus we praise the horse, who mocks our eyes, While, to the goal, with lightning’s speed, he flies !
Whom many a well-earned palm and trophy grace, And the Cirque hails, unrivalled in the race!
—Yes, he is noble, spring from whom he will, Whose footsteps, in the dust, are foremost still;
While Hirpine's stock are to the market led, If Victory perch but rarely on their head :
For no respect to pedigree is paid, No honour to a sire's illustrious shade.
Flung cheaply off, they drag the cumbrous wain, With shoulders bare and bleeding from the chain ;
Or take, with some blind ass in concert found, At Nepo's mill, their everlasting round.
That Rome may, therefore, YOU, not YOURS, admire, By virtuous actions, first, to praise aspire ;
Seek not to shine by borrowed light alone, But with your father's glories blend your own.
THIS to the youth, whom Rumour brands as vain, And swelling-full of his Neronian strain;
Perhaps, with truth :
-for rarely shall we find A sense of modesty in that proud kind.
But were my Ponticus content to raise
His honours thus, on a forefather's praise, Worthless the while,—’twould tinge my cheeks with shame— 'Tis dangerous building on another's fame, Lest the substructure fail, and on the ground Your baseless pile be hurled, in fragments, round.-
Stretched on the plain, the vine's weak tendrils try To clasp the elm they drop from ;
fail-and die!
Be brave, be just;
and, when your country's laws Call you to witness in a dubious cause, Though Phalaris plant his bull before your eye, And, frowning, dictate to your lips the lie, Think it a crime no tears can e'er efface, To purchase safety with compliance base, At honour's cost a feverish span extend, AND SACRIFICE FOR LIFE, LIFE'S ONLY END !
LiFE !
'tis not life-who merits death is dead ;
Though Gauran oysters for his feasts be spread, Though his limbs drip with exquisite perfume, And the late rose around his temples bloom !0, when the Province, long desired, you gain, Your boiling rage, your lust of wealth, restrain, And pity our allies :
all Asia grieves-
Her blood, her marrow, drained by legal thieves.
Revere the laws, obey the parent state ;
Observe what rich rewards the good await, What punishments the bad :
how Tutor sped, While Rome’s whole thunder rattled round his head !
And yet what boots it, that one spoiler bleed, If still a worse, and still a worse succeed ;
If neither fear nor shame control their theft, And Pansa seize the little Natta left ?
Haste then, Chærippus, ere thy rags be known, And sell the few thou yet canst call thine own, And 0, conceal the price!
'tis honest craft;
Thou could'st not keep the hatchet,-save the haft.
Not such the cries of old, nor such the stroke, When first the nations bowed beneath our yoke.
Wealth, then, was theirs, wealth without fear possest, Full every house, and bursting every chest-
Crimson, in looms of Sparta taught to glow, And purple, deeply dyed in grain of Co ;
Busts, to which Myro's touch did motion give, And ivory, taught by Phidias' skill to live ;
On every side a Polyclete you viewed, And scarce a board without a Mentor stood.
These, these, the lust of rapine first inspired, These, Antony and Dolabella fired, And sacrilegious Yerres:
—so, for Rome
They shipped their secret plunder;
and brought home More treasures from our friends, in peace obtained, Than from our foes, in war, were ever gained !
Now all is gone !
the stallion made a prey, The few brood-mares and oxen swept away, The Lares,—if the sacred hearth possest One little god, that pleased above the rest- Mean spoils, indeed!
but such were now their best.
Perhaps you scorn (and may securely scorn)
The essenced G reek, whom arts, not arms, adorn :
Soft limbs, and spirits by refinement broke, Would feebly struggle with the oppressive yoke But spare the Gaul, the fierce Illyrian spare, And the rough Spaniard, terrible in war;
Spare too the Afric hind, whose ceaseless pain Fills our wide granaries with autumnal grain, And pampers Rome, while weightier cares engage Her precious hours-the Circus and the Stage !
For, should you rifle them, 0 think in time, What spoil would pay the execrable crime, When greedy Marius fleeced them all so late, And bare and bleeding left the hapless state!
But chief the brave, and wretched-tremble there ;
Nor tempt too far the madness of despair :
For, should you all their little treasures drain, Helmets, and spears, and swords, would still remain ;
THE PLUNDERED NE'ER WANT ARMS.
What I foretell Is no trite apophthegm, but-mark me well-
True as a Sibyl's leaf!
fixed as an oracle!
If men of worth the posts beneath you hold, And no spruce favourite barter law for gold;
If no inherent stain your wife disgrace, Nor, harpy-like, she flit from place to place, A fell Celæno, ever on the watch, And ever furious, all she sees to snatch ;
Then choose what race you will:
derive your birth From Picus, or those elder sons of earth, Who shook the throne of heaven;
call him your sire, Who first informed our clay with living fire ;
Or single from the songs of ancient days, What tale may suit you, and what parent raise.
But-if rash pride, and lust, your bosom sway, If, with stern joy, you ply, from day to day, The ensanguined rods, and head on head demand, Till the tired axe drop from the lictor's hand ;
Then, every honour, by your father won, Indignant to be borne by such a son, Will, to his blood, oppose your daring claim, And fire a torch to blaze upon your shame !—
Vice glares more strongly in the public eye, As he who sins, in power or place is high.
SEE !
by his great progenitors' remains Fat Damasippus sweeps, with loosened reins.
Good Consul!
he no pride of office feels, But stoops, himself, to clog his headlong wheels. "
But this is all by night," the hero cries.
Yet the MOON sees !
yet the STARS stretch their eyes, Full on your shame !
-A few short moments wait, And Damasippus quits the pomp of state :
Then, proud the experienced driver to display, He mounts his chariot in the face of day, Whirls, with bold front, his grave associate by, And jerks his whip, to catch the senior's eye :
Unyokes his weary steeds, and, to requite
Their service, feeds and litters them, at night.
Meanwhile, 'tis all be can, what time lie stands At Jove's high altar, as the law commands, And offers sheep and oxen, he forswears The Eternal King, and gives his silent prayers To thee, Hippona, goddess of the stalls, And gods more vile, daubed on the reeking walls!
At night, to his old haunts he scours, elate, (The tavern by the Idumean gate,) Where, while the host, bedrenched with liquid sweets, With many a courteous phrase his entrance greets, And many a smile ;
the hostess nimbly moves, And gets the flagon ready, which he loves.
Here some, perhaps, my growing warmth may blame :
"
In youth's wild hours," they urge, " we did the same."
'Tis granted, friends ;
but then we stopped in time, Nor hugged our darling faults beyond our prime.
Brief let our follies be!
and youthful sin Fall, with the firstlings of the manly chin!-
Boys we may pity, nay, perhaps, excuse:
But Damasippus STILL frequents the stews, Though now mature in vigour, ripe in age, Of Cæsar’s foes to check the headlong rage, On Tigris' banks, in burnished arms, to shine, And sternly guard the Danube, or the Rhine."
The East revolts."
IIo !
let the troops repair To Ostium, quick! " But where's the General? " Where!
Go, search the taverns ;
there the chief you’ll find, With cut-throats, plunderers, rogues of every kind, Bier-jobbers, bargemen, drenched in fumes of wine, And Cybele's priests, mid their loose drums, supine!
There none are less, none greater than the rest, There my lord gives, and takes the scurvy jest;
There all who can, round the same table sprawl,
And there one greasy tankard serves for all.
Blessings of birth !-but, Ponticus, a word :
Owned you a slave like this degenerate lord, What were his fate ?
your Lucan farm to till, Or aid the mules to turn your Tuscan mill.
But Troy's great sons’dispense with being good, And boldly sin by courtesy of blood ;
Wink at each other's crimes, and look for fame
In what would tinge a cobbler's cheek with shame.
And have I wreaked on such foul deeds my rage, That worse should yet remain to blot my page !- See Damasippus, all his fortune lost, Compelled, for hire, to play a squealing ghost!
While Lentulus, his brother in renown, Performs, with so much art, the perjured clown, And suffers with such grace, that, for his pains, I hold him worthy of-the CROSS he feigns.
Nor deem the heedless rabble void of blame :
—
Strangers alike to decency and shame, They sit with brazen front, and calmly see
The hired patrician's low buffoonery;
Laugh at the Fabii's tricks, and grin to hear
The cuffs resound from the Mamerci's ear!
Who cares how low their blood is sold, how high ?—
No Nero drives them, now, their fate to try:
Freely they come, and freely they expose
Their lives for hire, to grace the public shows!
But grant the worst:
suppose the arena here, And there the stage ;
on which would you appear ?
The first :
for who of death so much in dread, As not to tremble more, the stage to tread, Squat on his hams, in some blind nook to sit, And watch his mistress, in a jealous fit !-
But 'tis not strange, that, when the Emperor tunes A scurvy harp, the lords should turn buffoons;
The wonder is, they turn not fencers too, Secutors, Retiarians—AND THEY DO !'
Gracchus steps forth :
No sword his thigh invests,- No helmet, shield-such armour he detests, Detests and spurns ;
and impudently stands, With the poised net and trident in his hands.
The foe advances—lo!
a cast he tries,
But misses, and in frantic terror flies Round the thronged Cirque ;
and, anxious to be known, Lifts his bare face, with many a piteous moan. "
'Tis he ! ’tis he!
—I know the Salian vest, With golden fringes, pendent from the breast;
The Salian bonnet, from whose pointed crown
The glittering ribands float redundant down.
O spare him, spare !
"-The brave Secutor heard, And, blushing, stopped the chase;
for he preferred Wounds, death itself, to the contemptuous smile, Of conquering one so noble, and-so vile !
Who, Nero, so depraved, if choice were free, To hesitate 'twixt Seneca and thee ?
Whose crimes, so much have they all crimes outgone, Deserve more serpents, apes, and sacks, than one.
Not so, thou say'st;
there are, whom I could name, As deep in guilt, and as accursed in fame;
Orestes slew HIS mother.
True ;
but know,
The same effects from different causes flow:
A father murdered at the social board, And heaven's command, unsheathed his righteous sword.
Besides, Orestes, in his wildest mood, Poisoned no cousin, shed no consort's blood, Buried no poniard in a sister's throat, Sung on no public stage, NO TROICKS WROTE.—
THIS topped his frantic crimes !
THIS roused mankind!
For what could Galba, what Virginius find, In the dire annals of that bloody reign, Which called for vengeance in a louder strain ?
Lo here, the arts, the studies that engage
The world's great master!
on a foreign stage, To prostitute his voice for base renown, And ravish, from the Greeks, a parsley crown !
Come then, great prince, great poet!
while we throng
To greet thee, recent from triumphant song, Come, place the unfading wreath, with reverence meet, On the Domitii's brows!
before their feet
The mask and pall of old Thyestes lay, And Menalippé;
while, in proud display, From the colossal marble of thy sire, Depends, the boast of Rome, thy conquering lyre!
Cethegus!
Catiline !
whose ancestors
Were nobler born, were higher ranked, than yours ?
Yet ye conspired, with more than Gallic hate, To wrap in midnight flames this hapless state ;
On men and gods your barbarous rage to pour, And deluge Rome with her own children's gore Horrors, which called, indeed, for vengeance dire, For the pitched coat and stake, and smouldering fire !
But Tully watched-your league in silence broke, And crushed your impious arms, without a stroke.
Yes he, poor Arpine, of no name at home, And scarcely ranked among the knights at Rome, Secured the trembling town, placed a firm guard In every street, and toiled in every ward :
—
And thus, within the walls, the GOWN obtained, More fame, for Tully, than Octavius gained At Actium and Philippi, from a SWORD, Drenched in the eternal stream by patriots poured!
For Rome, free Rome,'hailed him, with loud acclaim, THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY—glorious name !
360Another Arpine, trained the ground to till, Tired of the plough, forsook his native hill, And joined the camp ;
where, if his adze was slow, The vine-twig whelked his back with many a blow :
And yet, when the fierce Cimbri threatened Rome With swift, and scarcely evitable doom, This man, in the dread hour, to save her rose, And turned the impending ruin on her foes!
For which, while ravening birds devoured the slain, And their huge bones lay whitening on the plain, His high-born colleague to his worth gave way, And took, well pleased, the secondary bay.
The Decii were plebeians!

And mean the parent stock from which they came :
Yet they devoted, in the trying hour, Their heads to Earth, and each infernal Power ;
And by that solemn act, redeemed from fate, Auxiliars, legions, all the Latian state;
L More prized than those they saved, in heaven's just estimate!
jAnd him, who graced the purple which he wore, (The last good king of Rome,) a bondmaid bore.
The Consul's sons, (while storms yet shook the state, And Tarquin thundered vengeance at the gate,)
Who should, to crown the labours of their sire, Have dared what Codes, Mutius, might admire, And she, who mocked the javelins whistling round, And swam the Tiber, then the empire's bound;
Had to the tyrant's rage the town exposed, But that a slave their dark designs disclosed.- For Him, when stretched upon his honoured bier, The grateful matrons shed the pious tear, While, with stern eye, the patriot and the sire Saw, by the axe, the high-born pair expire :
They fell-just victims to the offended laws, And the first sacrifice to FREEDOM'S cause!
For me, who nought but innate worth admire, I'd rather vile Thersites were thy sire, So thou wert like Achilles, and could'st wield Vulcanian arms, the terror of the field, Than that Achilles should thy father be, And, in his offspring, vile Thersites see.
And yet, how high soe'er thy pride may trace
The long-forgotten founders of thy race, Still must the search with that Asylum end, From whose polluted source we all descend.
Haste then, the inquiry haste ;

Thy sire some vagrant slave, some bankrupt hind, Some-but I mark the kindling glow of shame, And will not shock thee with a baser name.
Juv. STILL drooping, Nævolus!
What, prithee, say, Portends this show of grief from day to day, This copy of flayed Marsyas ?
what dost thou With such a rueful face, and such a brow, As Ravola wore, when caught-Not so cast down Looked Pollio, when, of late, he scoured the town, And, proffering treble rate, from friend to friend, Found none so foolish, none so mad.
to lend !
But, seriously, for thine's a serious case, Whence came those sudden wrinkles in thy face ?
I knew thee once, a gay, light-hearted slave, Contented with the little fortune gave;
A sprightly guest, of every table free, And famed for modish wit and repartee.
Now all's reversed :
dejected is thy mien,
Thy locks are like a tangled thicket seen ;
And every limb, once smoothed with nicest care, Rank with neglect, a shrubbery of hair!
What dost thou with that dull, dead, withered look, Like some old debauchee, long ague-shook ?
All is not well within;
for, still we find
The face the unerring index of the mind, And as THIS feels or fancies joys or woes, THAT pales with sorrow, or with rapture glows.
What should I think ?
Too sure the scene is changed,
And thou from thy old course of life estranged For late, as I remember, at all haunts, Where dames of fashion flock to hire gallants, At Isis and at Ganymede's abodes, At Cybele's, dread mother of the gods, Nay, at chaste Ceres', (for at shame they spurn, And even her temples now to brothels turn,) None was so famed :
the favourites of the town, Baffled alike in business and renown, Murmuring retired ;
wives, daughters, were thy own, And-if the truth MUST come-not THEY alone.
NÆV.
Right:
and to some this trade has answered yet;
But not to me :
for what is all I get ?
A drugget cloak, to save my gown from rain, Coarse in its texture, dingy in its grain, And a few pieces of the " second vein !
3 FATE GOVERNS ALL.
Fate, with full sway, presides
Even o'er those parts, which modest nature hides;
And little, if her genial influence fail, Will vigour stead, or boundless powers avail:
Though Virro, gloating on your naked charms, Foam with desire, and woo you to his arms, With many a soothing, many a flattering phrase-
For your cursed pathics have such winning ways !
Hear now this prodigy, this mass impure, Of lust and avarice ! "
Let us, friend, be sure.:
I've given thee this, and this ;
-now count the sums :
"
(He counts, and woos the while,) " behold!
it comes
To five sestertia, five !-now, look again,
And see how much it overpays thy pain :
"
What!
" overpays ?
"-but you are formed for love, And worthy of the cup and couch of Jove !
-Will those relieve a client!—those, who grudge A wretched pittance to the painful drudge
That toils in their disease ?—0 mark, my friend, The blooming youth, to whom we presents send, Or on the Female Calends, or the day Which gave him birth !
in what a lady-way He takes our favours as he sits in state, And sees adoring crowds besiege his gate !
Insatiate sparrow!
whom do your domains,
Your numerous hills await, your numerous plains ?
Regions, which such a tract of land embrace, That kites are tired within the unmeasured space !
For you the purple vine luxuriant glows, On Trifoline's plain, and on Misenus' brows ;
And hollow Gaurus, from his fruitful hills, Your spacious vaults with generous nectar fills :
What were it, then, a few poor roods to grant
To one so worn with lechery and want ?
Sure yonder female, with the child she bred, The dog their playmate, and their little shed, Had, with more justice, been conferred on me, Than on a cymbal-beating debauchee !
"I'm troublesome,” you say, when I apply, And give ! give ! give!
is my eternal cry.”—
But house-rent due solicits to be sped, And my sole slave, importunate for bread, Follows me, clamouring in as loud a tone As Polyphemus, when his prey was flown.
Nor will this one suffice, the toil's so great!
Another must be bought;
and both must eat.
What shall I say, when cold December blows, And their bare limbs shrink at the driving snows, What shall I say, their drooping hearts to cheer ? "
Be merry, boys, the spring will soon be here !
"But though my other merits you deny, One yet must be allowed-that had not I, I, your devoted client, lent my aid, Your wife had to this hour remained a maid.
You know what motives urged me to the deed, And what was promised, could I but succeed :
—
Oft in my arms the flying fair I caught, And back to your cold bed, reluctant, brought, Even when she'd cancelled all her former vows, And now was signing to another spouse.
What pains it cost to set these matters right, While you stood whimpering at the door all night, I spare to tell:
—a friend like me has tied Full many a knot, when ready to divide.
Where will you turn you now, sir ?
whither fly ?
What, to my charges, first, or last, reply ?
Is it no merit, speak, ungrateful!
none,
To give you thus a daughter, or a son, Whom you may breed with credit at your board, And prove yourself a man upon record ?—
Haste, with triumphal wreaths your gates adorn, You 're now a father, now no theme for scorn ;
My toils have ta'en the opprobrium from your name, And stopt the babbling of malicious fame.
A parent's rights you now may proudly share, Now, thank my industry, be named an heir ;
Take now the whole bequest, with what beside, From lucky windfalls, may in time betide ;
And other blessings, if I but repeat My pains, and make the number THREE complete.
Juv.
Nay, thou hast reason to complain, I feel:
But, what says Virro ?
NÆV.
Not a syllable ;
But, while my wrongs and I unnoticed pass, Hunts out some other drudge, some two-legged ass.
Enough ;
-and never, on your life, unfold
The secret thus to you, in friendship told ;
But let my injuries, undivulged, still rest Within the closest chamber of your breast :
How the discovery might be borne, none knows-
And your smooth pathics are such fatal foes !
Virro, who trusts me yet, may soon repent,
And hate me for the confidence he lent;
With fire and sword my wretched life pursue, As if I'd blabbed already all 1 knew.
Sad situation mine !
for, in your ear, The rich can never buy revenge too dear;
And-but enough :
be cautious, I entreat, And secret as the Athenian judgment-seat.
Juv.
And dost thou seriously believe, fond swain, The actions of the great unknown remain ?
Poor Corydon !
even beasts would silence break, And stocks and stones, if servants did not, speak.
Bolt every door, stop every cranny tight, Close every window, put out every light;
Let not a whisper reach the listening ear, No noise, no motion;
let no soul be near;
Yet all that passed at the cock's second crow, The neighbouring vintner shall, ere daybreak, know;
With what besides the cook and carver's brain, Subtly malicious, can in vengeance feign!
For thus they glory, with licentious tongue, To quit the harsh command and galling thong.
Should these be mute, some drunkard in the streets
Will pour out all he knows to all he meets, Force them, unwilling, the long tale to hear, And with his stories drench their hapless ear.
Go now, and earnestly of those request, To lock, like me, the secret in their breast:
Alas!
they hear thee not;
and will not sell
The dear, dear privilege-to see and tell, For more stolen wine than late Saufeia boused, When, for the people's welfare, she—caroused !
LIVE VIRTUOUSLY :
-thus many a reason cries, But chiefly this, that so thou may'st despise
Thy servant's tongue ;
for, lay this truth to heart, The tongue is the vile servant's vilest part:
Yet viler he, who lives in constant dread
Of the domestic spies that—eat his bread.
NÆV.
Well have you taught, how we may best disdain
The envenomed babbling of our household train ;
But this is general, and to all applies :
—
What, in my proper case, would you advise ?
After such flattering expectations crost, And so much time in vain dependence lost ?
For youth, too transient flower!
of life's short day
The shortest part, but blossoms-to decay.
Lo !
while we give the unregarded hour
To revelry and joy, in Pleasure's bower, While now for rosy wreaths our brows to twine, And now for nymphs we call, and now for wine, The noiseless foot of Time steals swiftly by, And ere we dream of manhood, age is nigh!
Juv.
Oh, fear not:
thou canst never seek in vain A pathic friend, while these seven hills remain.
Hither in crowds the master-misses come, From every point, as to their proper home :
One hope has failed, another may succeed ;
Meanwhile do thou on hot eringo feed.
NÆV.
Tell this to happier men;
the Fates ne'er meant Such luck for me :
my Clotho is content, When all my toil a bare subsistence gains, And fills my belly, by my back and reins.0, my poor Lares!
dear, domestic Powers !
To whom I come with incense, cakes, and flowers, When shall my prayers, so long preferred in vain, Acceptance find ?
0, when shall I obtain Enough to free me from the constant dread
Of life's worst ill, grey hairs and want of bread ?
On mortgage, six-score pounds a year, or eight, A little sideboard, which, for overweight, Fabricius would have censured ;
a stout pair Of hireling Mæsians, to support my chair, In the thronged Circus:
add to these, one slave Well skilled to paint, another to engrave ;
And I—but let me give these day-dreams o’er—
Wish as I may, I ever shall be.
poor ;
For when to Fortune I prefer my prayers,
The obdurate goddess stops at once her ears;
Stops with that wax which saved Ulysses' crew, When by the Syrens' rocks and songs they flew, False songs and treacherous rocks, that all to ruin drew.
IN every clime, from Ganges' distant stream To Gades, gilded by the western beam, Few, from the clouds of mental error free, In its true light or good or evil see.
For what, with reason, do we seek or shun?
What plan, how happily soe'er begun, But, finished, we our own success lament, And rue the pains, so fatally misspent ?—
To headlong ruin see whole houses driven, Cursed with their prayers, by too indulgent heaven !
Bewildered thus by folly or by fate, We beg pernicious gifts in every state, In peace, in war.
A full and rapid flow
Of eloquence, lays many a speaker low :
Even strength itself is fatal ;
Milo tries
His wondrous arms, and-in the trial dies !
But avarice wider spreads her deadly snare, And hoards amassed with too successful care, Hoards, which o'er all paternal fortunes rise, As o'er the dolphin towers the whale in size.
For this, in other times, at Nero's word, The ruffian bands unsheathed the murderous sword, Rushed to the swelling coffers of the great, Chased Lateranus from his lordly seat, Besieged too-wealthy Seneca's wide walls, And closed, terrific, round Longinus' halls :
While sweetly in their cocklofts slept the poor, And heard no soldier thundering at their door.
The traveller, freighted with a little wealth, Sets forth at night, and wins his way by stealth :
Even then, he fears the bludgeon and the blade, And starts and trembles at a rush's shade ;
While, void of care, the beggar trips along, And, in the spoiler's presence, trolls his song.
The first great wish that all with rapture own, The general cry, to every temple known, Is, gold, gold, gold!—“ and let, all-gracious Powers, The largest chest the Forum boasts be ours! "
Yet none from earthen bowls destruction sip :
Dread then the draught, when.
mantling, at your lip,
The goblet sparkles, radiant from the mine, And the broad gold inflames the rnby wine.
And do we, now, admire the stories told Of the two Sages, so renowned of old;
How this for ever laughed, whene'er he stept Beyond the threshold ;
that, for ever wept ?
But all can laugh :
-the wonder yet appears,
What fount supplied the eternal stream of tears !
Democritus, at every step he took, His sides with unextinguished laughter shook, Though, in his days, Abdera's simple towns, No fasces knew, chairs, litters, purple gowns.—
What!
had he seen, in his triumphal car, Amid the dusty Cirque, conspicuous far, The Prætor perched aloft, superbly drest In Jove's proud tunic, with a trailingvest Of Tyrian tapestry, and o'er him spread A crown, too bulky for a mortal head, Borne by a sweating slave, maintained to ride
In the same car, and mortify his pride !
Add now the bird, that, with expanded wing, From the raised sceptre seems preparedtospring ;
And trumpets here ;
and there the long parade
Of duteous friends, who head the cavalcade;
Add, too, the zeal of clients robed in white, Who hang upon his reins, and grace the sight, Unbribed, unbought,—save by the dole, at night!
Yes, in those days, in every varied scene, The good old man found matter for his spleen :
A wondrous sage!
whose story makes it clear
That men may rise in folly's atmosphere, Beneath Bœotian fogs, of soul sublime, And great examples to the coming time.-
He laughed aloud to see the vulgar fears, Laughed at their joys, and sometimes at their tears :
Secure the while, he mocked at Fortune's frown, And when she threatened, bade her hang or drown !
Superfluous then, or fatal, is the prayer, Which, to the Immortals' knees, we fondly bear.
Some, POWER hurls headlong from her envied height, Some, the broad tablet, flashing on the sight, With titles, names :
the statues, tumbled down, Are dragged by hooting thousands through the town ;
The brazen cars torn rudely from the yoke, And, with the blameless steeds, to shivers broke-
Then roar the fires!
the sooty artist blows, And all Sejanus in the furnace glows;
Sejanus, once so honoured, so adored, And only second to the world's great lord, Runs glittering from the mould, in cups and cans, Basons and ewers, plates, pitchers, pots, and pans."
Crown all your doors with bay, triumphant bay !
Sacred to Jove, the milk-white victim slay;
For lo !
where great Sejanus by the throng, A joyful spectacle !
is dragged along.
What lips!
what cheeks!
ha, traitor!—for my part, I never loved the fellow-in my heart." "
But tell me;
Why was he adjudged to bleed ?
And who discovered ?
and who proved the deed ? ” “ Proved !—a huge, wordy letter came to-day From Capreæ.”
Good!
what think the people ?
They!
They follow fortune, as of old, and hate, With their whole souls, the victim of the state.
Yet would the herd, thus zealous, thus on fire, Had Nurscia met the Tuscan's fond desire, And crushed the unwary prince, have all combined, And hailed Sejanus, MASTER OF MANKIND!
For since their votes have been no longer bought, All public care has vanished from their thought;
And those who once, with unresisted sway, Gave armies, empire, every thing, away, For two poor claims have long renounced the whole, And only ask,—the Circus and the Dole."
But there are more to suffer." " So I find ;
A fire so fierce for one was ne'er designed.
I met my friend Brutidius, and I fear, From his pale looks, he thinks there’s danger near.
What if this Ajax, in his frenzy, strike, Suspicious of our zeal, at all alike ! " "
True :
fly we then, our loyalty to show;
And trample on the carcass of his foe, While yet exposed on Tiber's banks it lies "— But let our slaves be there," another cries:
" Yes ;
let them (lest our ardour they forswear, And drag us, pinioned, to the Bar,) be there."
Thus of the favourite's fall the converse ran,
And thus the whisper passed from man to man.
Lured by the splendour of his happier hour, Would'st thou possess Sejanus' wealth and power ;
See crowds of suppliants at thy levee wait, Give this to sway the army, that the state ;
And keep a prince in ward, retired to reign O'er Capreæ’s crags, with his Chaldean train ?
Yes, yes, thou would'st (for I can read thy breast)
Enjoy that favour which he once possest, Assume all offices, grasp all commands, The Imperial Horse, and the Praetorian Bands.
'Tis nature, this;
even those who want the will, Pant for the dreadful privilege to kill:
Yet what delight can rank and power bestow, Since every joy is balanced by its woe !
-STILL would'st thou choose the favourite's purple, say ?
Or, thus forewarned, some paltry hamlet sway ?
At Gabii, or Fidenæ, rules propound, For faulty measures, and for wares unsound ;
And take the tarnished robe, and petty state, Of poor Ulubræ’s ragged magistrate ?
—You grant me then, Sejanus grossly erred, Nor knew what prayer his folly had preferred :
For when he begged for too much wealth and power, Stage above stage, he raised a tottering tower, And higher still, and higher ;
to be thrown, With louder crash, and wider ruin down!
What wrought the Crassi, what the Pompeys' doom, And his, who bowed the stubborn neck of Rome ?
What but the wild, the unbounded wish to rise, Heard, in malignant kindness, by the skies!
Few kings, few tyrants, find a bloodless end, Or to the grave, without a wound, descend.
The child, with whom a trusty slave is sent, Charged with his little scrip, has scarcely spent
His mite at school, ere all his bosom glows
With the fond hope he never more foregoes, To reach Demosthenes' or Tully's name, Rival of both in eloquence and fame !—
Yet by this eloquence, alas !
expired Each orator, so envied, so admired!
Yet by the rapid and resistless sway Of torrent genius, each was swept away!
Genius, for that, the baneful potion sped, And lopt, from this, the hands and gory head :
While meaner pleaders unmolested stood, Nor stained the rostrum with their wretched blood.
" HowfortuNATE A NATAL day was thine, In that LATE conSULATE, 0 Rome, of mine !"
Oh, soul of eloquence !
had all been found
An empty vaunt, like this, a jingling sound, Thou might'st, in peace, thy humble fame have borne, And laughed the swords of Antony to scorn !
Yet this would I prefer, the common jest, To that which fired the fierce triumvir's breast, That second scroll, where eloquence divine Burst on the ear, from every glowing line.
And he too fell, whom Athens, wondering, saw Her fierce democracy, at will, o'erawe, And "fulmine over Greece! " some angry Power Scowled, with dire influence, on his natal hour.-
Bleared with the glowing mass, the ambitions sire, From anvils, sledges, bellows, tongs, and fire, From tempting swords, his own more safe employ, To study RHETORIC, sent his hopeful boy.
The spoils of WAR;
the trunk in triumph placed, With all the trophies of the battle graced, Crushed helms, and battered shields;
and streamers borne From vanquished fleets, and beams from chariots torn;
And arcs of triumph, where the captive foe Bends, in mute anguish, o'er the pomp below, Are blessings, which the slaves of glory rate Beyond a mortal's hope, a mortal's fate!
Fired with the love of these, what countless swarms, Barbarians, Romans, Greeks, have rushed to arms, All danger slighted, and all toil defied, And madly conquered, or as madly died !
So much the raging thirst of fame exceeds
The generous warmth, which prompts to worthy deeds, That none confess fair Virtue's genuine power, Or woo her to their breast, without a dower.
Yet has this wild desire, in other days, This boundless avarice of a few for praise, This frantic rage for names to grace a tomb, Involved whole countries in one general doom :
Vain " rage ! " the roots of the wild fig-tree rise, Strike through the marble, and their memory dies !
For, like their mouldering tenants, tombs decay, And, with the dust they hide, are swept away.
Produce the urn that Hannibal contains, And weigh the mighty dust, which yet remains :
AND IS THIS ALL!
Yet THIS was once the bold, The aspiring chief, whom Afric could not hold, Though stretched in breadth from where the Atlantic roars, To distant Nilus, and his sun-burnt shores ;
In length, from Carthage to the burning zone, Where other moors, and elephants are known.
-.-Spain conquered, o'er the Pyrenees he bounds :
Nature opposed her everlasting mounds, Her Alps, and snows;
o'er these, with torrent force, He pours, and rends through rocks his dreadful course.
Already at his feet Italia lies ;

Big words !-but view his figure !

Subdued on Zama's memorable day, He flies in exile to a petty state, With headlong haste!
and, at a despot's gate, Sits, mighty suppliant!
of his life in doubt, Till the Bithynian's morning nap be out.
No swords, nor spears, nor stones from engines hurled, Shall quell the man whose frown alarmed the world :
The vengeance due to Cannæ's fatal field, And floods of human gore, a ring shall yield !—
Fly, madman, fly !

One world, the ambitious youth of Pella found Too small ;
and tossed his feverish limbs around, And gasped for breath, as if immured the while In Gyaræ, or Seripho's rocky isle :
But entering Babylon, found ample room Within the narrow limits of a tomb!
255 Death, the great teacher, Death alone proclaims
The true dimensions of our puny frames.
The daring tales, in Grecian story found, Were once believed :
-of Athos sailed around, Of fleets, that bridges o'er the waves supplied, Of chariots, rolling on the stedfast tide, Of lakes exhausted, and of rivers quaft, By countless nations, at a morning's draught, And all that Sostratus so wildly sings, Besotted poet, of the king of kings.
265But how returned he, say ?
this soul of fire, This proud barbarian, whose impatient ire Chastised the winds, that disobeyed his nod, With stripes, ne'er suffered from the Æolian god;
Fettered the Shaker of the sea and land-
But, in pure clemency, forbore to brand!
And sure, if aught can touch the Powers above, This calls for all their service, all their love !-
But how returned be ?
say
His navy lost, In a small bark he fled the hostile coast, And, urged by terror, drove his labouring prore, Through floating carcasses, and floods of gore.
So Xerxes sped, so speed the conquering race;
They catch at glory, and they clasp disgrace!"

For this, with earnest cries,
Or sick or well, we supplicate the skies.
Pernicious prayer !
for mark what ills attend, Still, on the old, as to the grave they bend :
A ghastly visage, to themselves unknown, For a smooth skin, a hide with scurf o'ergrown, And such a cheek, as many a grandam ape, In Tabraca's thick woods, is seen to scrape.
Strength, beauty, and a thousand charms beside, With sweet distinction, youth from youth divide;
While age presents one universal face :
A faultering voice, a weak and trembling pace, An ever-dropping nose, a forehead bare, And toothless gums to mumble o'er its fare.
Poor wretch !
behold him, tottering to his fall, So loathsome to himself, wife, children, all, That those who hoped the legacy to share, And flattered long,-disgusted, disappear.
The sluggish palate dulled, the feast no more Excites the same sensations as of yore ;
Taste, feeling, all, a universal blot, And e'en the rites of love remembered not:
Or if,—through the long night he feebly strives
To raise a flame where not a spark survives;
\ While Venus marks the effort with distrust, And hates the grey decrepitude of lust.
Another loss !-no joy can song inspire, Though famed Seleucus lead the warbling quire :
The sweetest airs escape him ;
and the lute, Which thrills the general ear, to him is mute.—
He sits, perhaps, too distant:
bring him near ;
Alas !
'tis still the same :
he scarce can bear
The deep-toned horn, the trumpet's clanging sound, And the loud blast which shakes the benches round.
Even at his ear, his slave must bawl the hour, And shout the comer's name, with all his power!
Add that a fever only warms his veins,
And thaws the little blood which yet remains;
That ills of every kind, and every name, Rush in, and seize the unresisting frame.
Ask you how many ?
I could sooner say How many drudges Hippia kept in pay, How many orphans Basilus beguiled, How many pupils Hæmolus defiled, How many men long Maura overmatched, How many patients Themison despatched In one short autumn;
nay, perhaps, record, How many villas call my quondam barber lord !
These their shrunk shoulders, those their hams bemoan;
This hath no eyes, and envies that with one :
This takes, as helpless at the board he stands, His food, with bloodless lips, from others' hands ;
While that, whose eager jaws, instinctive, spread
At every feast, gapes feebly to be fed, Like Progne's brood, when, laden with supplies, From bill to bill, the fasting mother flies.
But other ills, and worse, succeed to those :
His limbs long since were gone ;
his memory goes.
Poor driveller!
he forgets his servants quite, Forgets, at morn, with whom he supped at night;
Forgets the children he begot and bred ;
And makes a strumpet heiress in their stead.-
So much avails it the rank arts to use, Gained, by long practice, in the loathsome stews !
But grant his senses unimpaired remain ;
Still woes on woes succeed, a mournful train!
He sees his sons, his daughters, all expire, His faithful consort on the funeral pyre, Sees brothers, sisters, friends, to ashes turn, And all he loved, or loved him, in their urn.
Lo here, the dreadful fine we ever pay For life protracted to a distant day!
To see our house by sickness, pain pursued, And scenes of death incessantly renewed :
In sable weeds to waste the joyless years, And drop, at last, mid solitude and tears !
The Pylian's (if we credit Homer's page)
Was only second to the raven's age.
" 0 happy, sure, beyond the common rate, Who warded off, so long, the stroke of fate !
Who told his years by centuries, who so oft Quaffed the new must!
0 happy, sure "-But, soft.
This " happy " man of destiny complained, Cursed his grey hairs, and every god arraigned ;
What time he lit the pyre, with streaming eyes, And, in dark volumes, saw the flames arise Round his Antilochus :
—" Tell me," he cried, To every friend who lingered at his side, " Tell me what crimes have roused the Immortals' hate, That thus, in vengeance, they protract my date ?
"So questioned heaven Laertes—Peleus so- (Their hoary heads bowed to the grave with woe)
While this bewailed his son, at Ilium slain ;
That his, long wandering o'er the faithless main.
While Troy yet flourished, had her Priam died, With what solemnity, what funeral pride, Had he descended, every duty paid, To old Assaracus, illustrious shade !—
Hector himself, bedewed with many a tear, Had joined his brothers to support the bier;
And Troy's dejected dames, a numerous train, Followed, in sable pomp, and wept amain, As sad Polyxena her pall had rent, And wild Cassandra raised the loud lament:
Had he but fallen, ere his adulterous boy Spread his bold sails, and left the shores of Troy.
But what did lengthened life avail the sire ?
To see his realm laid waste by sword and fire.
Then too, too late, the feeble soldier tried Unequal arms, and flung his crown aside;
Tottered, his children's murderer to repel, With trembling haste, and at Jove's altar fell, Fell without effort;
like the steer, that, now, Time-worn and weak, and, by the ungrateful plough, Spurned forth to slaughter, to the master's knife Yields his shrunk veins and miserable life.
His end, howe'er, was human ;
while his mate, Doomed, in a brute, to drain the dregs of fate, Pursued the foes of Troy from shore to shore, And barked and howled at those she cursed before.
I pass, while hastening to the Roman page, The Pontic king, and Croesus, whom the Sage Wisely forbad in fortune to confide, Or take the name of HAPPY, till he died.
That Marius, exiled from his native plains, Was hid in fens, discovered, bound in chains ;
That, bursting these, to Africa he fled, And, through the realms he conquered, begged his bread, Arose from age, from treacherous age alone:
For what had Rome, or earth, so happy known, Had he, in that blest moment, ceased to live, When, graced with all that Victory could give, " Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war," He first alighted from his Cimbrian car!
Campania, prescient of her Pompey's fate, Send a kind fever to arrest his date :
When lo !
a thousand suppliant altars rise, And public prayers obtain him of the skies.
Ill done!
that head, thus rescued from the grave, His Evil Fate and ours, by Nilus' wave, Lopt from the trunk :
-such mutilation dire }
Cornelius 'scaped;
Cethegus fell entire;
And Catiline pressed, whole, the funeral pyre.
Whene'er the fane of Venus meets her eye, The anxious mother breathes a secret sigh For handsome boys;
but asks, with bolder prayer, " That all her girls be exquisitely fair ! "
And wherefore not ?
Latona, in the sight Of Dian's beauty, took unblamed delight."
True ;
but Lucretia cursed her fatal charms,
When spent with struggling in a Tarquin's arms ;
And poor Virginia would have changed her grace For Rutila's crooked back and homely face."
But boys may still be fair ? "
No ;
they destroy
Their parents' peace, and murder all their joy ;
For rarely do we meet, in one combined, A beauteous body and a virtuous mind, Though, through the rugged line, there still has run A Sabine sanctity, from sire to son.—
Besides, should Nature, in her kindest mood, Confer the ingenuous flush of modest blood, The disposition chaste as unsunned snow- (And what can Nature more than these bestow, These, which no art, no care can give ?)—even then, They cannot hope, they must not, to be men!
Smit with their charms, the imps of hell appear, And pour their proffers in a parent's ear, For prostitution !—infamously bold, And trusting to the almighty power of gold :
While youths in shape and air less formed to please, No tyrants mutilate, no Neros seize.
Go now, and triumph in your beauteous boy, Your Ganymede!
whom other ills annoy, And other dangers wait:
his graces known, He stands professed, the favourite of the town;
And dreads, incessant dreads, on every hand, The vengeance which a husband's wrongs demand :
For sure detection follows soon or late ;
Born under Mars, he cannot scape his fate.
Oft on the adulterer, too, the furious spouse Inflicts worse evils than the law allows ;
By blows, stripes, gashes some are robbed of breath, And others, by the mullet, racked to death."
But my Endymion will more lucky prove, And serve a beauteous mistress, all for love."
No;
he will soon to ugliness be sold, And serve a toothless grandam, all for gold.
Servilia will not lose him ;
jewels, clothes, All, all she sells, and all on him bestows;
For women nought to the dear youth deny, Or think his labours can be bought too high :
When love's the word, the naked sex appear, And every niggard is a spendthrift here."
But if my boy with virtue be endued, What harm will beauty do him ? "
Nay, what good ?
Say, what availed, of old, to Theseus' son, The stern resolve ?
what, to Bellerophon ?— 0, then did Phædra redden, then her pride Took fire, to be so stedfastly denied !
Then, too, did Sthenoboea glow with shame, And both burst forth with unextinguished flame !
A woman scorned is pitiless as fate, For, there, the dread of shame adds stings to hate.
But Silius comes.
—Now, be thy judgment tried :
Shall he accept, or not, the proffered bride, And marry Cæsar's wife ?
hard point, in truth :
Lo !
this most noble, this most beauteous youth, Is hurried off, a helpless sacrifice
To the lewd glance of Messalina's eyes !
-Haste, bring the victim :
in the nuptial vest Already see the impatient Empress drest;
The genial couch prepared, the accustomed sum Told out, the augurs and the notaries come. "
But why all these ? "
You think, perhaps, the rite Were better, known to few, and kept from sight :
Not so the lady ;
she abhors a flaw, And wisely calls for every form of law.
But what shall Silius do ?
refuse to wed ?
A moment sees him numbered with the dead.
Consent, and gratify the eager dame ?
He gains a respite, till the tale of shame, Through town and country, reach the Emperor's ear, Still sure the last-his own disgrace to hear.
Then let him, if a day's precarious life
Be worth his study, make the fair his wife ;
For wed or not, poor youth, 'tis still the same, And still the axe must mangle that fine frame !
Say then, shall man, deprived all power of choice, Ne'er raise to heaven the supplicating voice ?
Not so ;
but to the gods his fortunes trust :
Their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just.
What best may profit or delight they know, And real good for fancied bliss bestow :
With eyes of pity they our frailties scan ;
More dear to them, than to himself, is man.
By blind desire, by headlong passion driven, For wife and heirs we daily weary Heaven :
Yet still 'tis Heaven's prerogative to know, If heirs, or wife, will bring us weal or woe.
But, (for 'tis good our humble hope to prove,) That thou may'st, still, ask something from above ;
Thy pious offerings to the temple bear, And, while the altars blaze, be this thy prayer.
O THOU, who know'st the wants of human kind, Vouchsafe me health of body, health of mind;
A soul prepared to meet the frowns of fate, And look undaunted on a future state ;
That reckons death a blessing, yet can bear Existence nobly, with its weight of care ;
That anger and desire alike restrains, And counts Alcides' toils, and cruel pains, Superior far to banquets, wanton nights, And all the Assyrian monarch's soft delights !
Here bound, at length, thy wishes.
I but teach
What blessings man, by his own powers, may reach.
THE PATH TO PEACE IS VIRTUE.
We should see, If wise, 0 Fortune, nought divine in thee :
But we have deified a name alone, And fixed in heaven thy visionary throne!
IF
Atticus in sumptuous fare delight, 'Tis taste :
if Rutilus, 'tis madness quite :
And what diverts the sneering rabble more Than an Apicius miserably poor ?
In every company, go where you will, Bath, forum, theatre, the talk is still Of Rutilus!
—While fit (tliey cry) -to wield, With firm and vigorous arm, the spear and shield, While his full veins beat high with youthful blood, Forced by no tribune-yet by none withstood, He cultivates the gladiator's trade, And learns the imperious language of the blade.
What swarms we see of this degenerate kind !
Swarms whom their creditors can only find
At flesh and fish-stalls :
—thither they repair, Sure, though deceived at home, to catch them there.
These live but for their palate ;
and, of these, The most distressed, (while Ruin hastes to seize
The crumbling mansion and disparting wall,) Spread richer feasts, and riot as they fall !-
Meanwhile, ere yet the last supply be spent, They search for dainties every element, Awed by no price ;
nay, making this their boast, And still preferring that which costs them most, Joyous, and reckless of to-morrow's fate, To raise a desperate sum, they pledge their plate, Or mother's fractured image ;
to prepare Yet one treat more, though but in earthen ware!
Then to the fencer's mess they come, of course, And mount the scaffold as a last resource.
No foe to sumptuous boards, I only scan, When such are spread, the motives, and the man, And praise or censure, as I see the feast
Or by the noble or the beggar drest :
In this, 'tis gluttony ;
in that, fit pride, Sanctioned by wealth, by station dignified.—
Whip me the fool, who marks how Atlas soars
O'er every hill on Mauritania's shores, Yet sees no difference 'twixt the coffer's hoards, And the poor pittance a small purse affords !
Heaven sent us, " KNOW THYSELF!
"-Be this imprest, In living characters, upon thy breast, And still revolved ;
whether a wife thou choose, Or to the SACRED SENATE point thy views.-
Or seek'st thou rather, in some doubtful cause, To vindicate thy country's injured laws ?
Knock at thy bosom, play the censor's part, And note with caution what and who thou art, An orator of force and skill profound, Or a mere Matho, emptiness and sound!
Yes, KNOW THYSELF :
in great concerns, in small, Be this thy care, for this, my friend, is all :
Nor, when thy purse will scarce a gudgeon buy, With fond intemperance, for turbots sigh !
O think what end awaits thee, timely think,
If thy throat widens as thy pockets shrink, Thy throat, of all thy father's thrift could save, Flocks, herds, and fields, the insatiable grave !—
At length, when nought remains a meal to bring, The last poor shift, off comes the knightly ring, And " sad Sir Pollio " begs his daily fare, With undistinguished hands, and finger bare!
To these, an early grave no terror brings. "
A short and merry life ! " the spendthrift sings ;
Death seems to him a refuge from despair, And far less terrible than hoary hair.
Mark now the progress of their rapid fate!
Money, (regardless of the monthly rate,) On every side, they borrow, and apace, Waste what is raised before the lender's face:
Then, while they yet some wretched remnant hold, And the pale usurer trembles for his gold, They wisely sicken for the country air, And flock to Baiæ, Ostia, Jove knows where.-
For now 'tis held (so rife the evil's grown)
No greater shame, for debt, to flee the town, Than from the thronged Suburra to remove, In dog-days, to the Esquilian shades above.
One thought alone, what time they leave behind Friends, country, all, weighs heavy on their mind, One thought alone,-for twelve long months to lose
The dear delights of Rome, the public shows!
Where sleeps the modest blood !
In all our veins, No conscious drop, to form a blush, remains :
SHAME, from the town, derided, speeds her way, And few, alas!
solicit her to stay.
Enough :
to-day my Persicus shall see
Whether my precepts with my life agree ;
Whether, with feigned austerity, I prize The spare repast, a glutton in disguise!
Bawl for coarse pottage, that my friends may hear, But whisper " sweetmeats! " in my servant's ear.
For since, by promise, you are now my guest, Know, I invite you to no sumptuous feast, But to such simple fare, as long, long since, The good Evander bade the Trojan prince.
Come then, my friend, you will not, sure, despise
The food that pleased the offspring of the skies ;
Come, and while fancy brings past times to view, I 'll think myself the king, the hero you.
Take now your bill of fare • my simple board with no dainties from the market stored, But dishes all my own.
From Tibur's stock
A kid shall come, the fattest of the flock, The tenderest too, and yet too young to browse
The thistle's shoots, the willow's watery boughs, With more of milk than blood ;
and pullets drest With new-laid eggs, yet tepid from the nest, And sperage wild, which, from the mountain's side, My housemaid left her spindle to provide ;
And grapes long kept, yet pulpy still, and fair, And the rich Signian and the Syrian pear ;
And apples, that in flavour and in smell
The boasted Picene equal, or excel :
-
Nor need you fear, my friend, their liberal use, For age has mellowed and improved their juice.
How homely this!
and yet this homely fare A senator would, once, have counted rare ;
When the good Curius thought it no disgrace
O'er a few sticks a little pot to place, With herbs by his small garden-plot supplied-
Food, which the squalid wretch would now deride, Who digs in fetters, and, with fond regret, The tavern's savoury dish remembers yet!
Time was, when, on the rack, a man would lay
The seasoned flitch, against a solemn day ;
And think the friends who met, with decent mirth, To celebrate the hour which gave him birth, On this, and what of fresh the altars spared, (For altars then were honoured,) nobly fared.
Some kinsman, who had camps and senates swayed, Had thrice been consul, once dictator made, From public cares retired, would gaily haste, Before the wonted hour, to such repast, Shouldering the spade, that, with no common toil, Had tamed the genius of the mountain soil.- the Fabian name, The Scauran, and Fabrician ;
when they saw A censor's rigour even a censor awe, 140 No son of Troy e'er thought it his concern, Or worth a moment's serious care, to learn, What land, what sea, the fairest tortoise bred, Whose clouded shell might best adorn his bed.-
His bed was small, and did no signs impart
Or of the painter's or the sculptor's art, Save where the front, cheaply inlaid with brass, Showed the rude features of a vine-crowned ass ;
An uncouth brute, round which his children played, And laughed and jested at the face it made !
Briefly, his house, his furniture, his food, Were uniformly plain, and simply good.
Then the rough soldier, yet untaught by Greece To hang, enraptured, o'er a finished piece, If haply, mid the congregated spoils, (Proofs of his power, and guerdon of his toils,) Some antique vase of master-hands were found, Would dash the glittering bauble on the ground ;
That, in new forms, the molten fragments drest, Might blaze illustrious round his courser's chest, Or, flashing from his burnished helmet, show (A dreadful omen to the trembling foe)
The mighty sire, with glittering shield and spear, Hovering, enamoured, o'er the sleeping fair, The wolf, by Rome's high destinies made mild, And, playful at her side, each wondrous child.
Thus, all the wealth those simple times could boast, Small wealth !
their horses and their arms engrost;
The rest was homely, and their frugal fare, Cooked without art, was served in earthen ware :
Yet worthy all our envy, were the breast
But with one spark of noble spleen possest.
THEN shone the fanes with majesty divine, A present god was felt at every shrine !
And solemn sounds, heard from the sacred walls, At midnight's solemn hour, announced the Gauls, Now rushing from the main ;
while, prompt to save, Stood Jove, the prophet of the signs he gave !
Yet, when he thus revealed the will of fate, And watched attentive o'er the Latian state, His shrine, his statue, rose of humble mould, Of artless form, and unprofaned with gold.
Those good old times no foreign tables sought;
From their own woods the walnut tree was brought, When withering limbs declared its pith unsound, Or winds uptore, and stretched it on the ground.
But now, such strange caprice has seized the great, They find no pleasure in the costliest treat, Suspect the flowers a sickly scent exhale, And think the ven'son rank, the turbot stale, Unless wide-yawning panthers, towering high-
Enormous pedestals of ivory, Formed of the teeth which Elephantis sends, Which the dark Moor, or darker Indian, vends, Or those which, now, too heavy for the head, The beasts in Nabathea's forest shed-
The spacious ORBS support:
then they can feed, And every dish is delicate indeed !
For silver feet are viewed with equal scorn, As iron rings upon the finger worn.
To me, for ever be the guest unknown, Who, measuring my expenses by his own, Remarks the difference with a scornful leer, And slights my humble house and homely cheer.
Look not to me for ivory ;
I have none :
My chess-board and my men are all of bone ;
Nay, my knife-handles ;
yet, my friend, for this, My pullets neither cut nor taste amiss.
I boast no artist, tutored in the school
Of learned Trypherus, to carve by rule ;
Where large sow-paps of elm, and boar, and hare, And phœnicopter, and pygargus rare, Getulian oryx, Scythian pheasants, point, The nice anatomy of every joint;
And dull blunt tools, severing the wooden treat, Clatter around, and deafen all the street.
My simple lad, whose highest efforts rise
To broil a steak in the plain country guise, Knows no such art;
humbly content to serve, And bring the dishes which he cannot kerve.
Another lad, (for I have two to-day,) Clad, like the first, in home-spun russet grey, Shall fill our earthen bowls :
no Phrygian he, No pampered attribute of luxury, But a rude rustic :
-when you want him, speak, And speak in Latin, for he knows not Greek.
Both go alike, with close-crept hair, undrest, But spruced to-day in honour of my guest;
And both were born on my estate, and one
Is my rough shepherd's, one, my neatherd's son.
Poor youth !
he mourns, with many an artless tear, His long, long absence from his mother dear ;
Sighs for his little cottage, and would fain Meet his old play fellows, the goats, again.
Though humble be his birth, ingenuous grace Beams from his eye, and flushes in his face ;
Charming suffusion !
that would well become
The youthful offspring of the chiefs of Rome.—
He, Persicus, shall fill us wine which grew
Where first the breath of life the stripling drew, On Tibur's hills ;
-dear hills, that, many a day Witnessed the transports of his infant play.
But you, perhaps, expect a wanton throng Of Gaditanian girls, with dance and song, To kindle loose desire ;
girls, that now bound Aloft with active grace, now, on the ground, } Quivering, alight, while peals of praise go round.
Lo !
wives, beside their husbands placed, behold, What could not in their ear, for shame, be told Expedients of the rich, the blood to fire, And wake the dying embers of desire.
Behold ?
0 heavens !
they view, with keenest gust,
These strong provocatives of jaded lust;
With every gesture feel their passions rise, And draw in pleasure both at ears and eyes !
Such vicious fancies are too great for me.
Let him the wanton dance unblushing see, And hear the immodest terms which, in the stews, The veriest strumpet would disdain to use, Whose drunken spawlings roll, tumultuous, o'er The proud expansion of a marble floor :
For there the world a large allowance make, And spare the folly for the fortune's sake.- Dice, and adultery, with a small estate, Are damning crimes;
but venial, with a great;
Venial ?
nay, graceful:
witty, gallant, brave, And such wild tricks " as gentlemen should have !
"My feast, to-day, shall other joys afford :
Hushed as we sit around the frugal board, Great Homer shall his deep-toned thunder roll, 'And mighty Maro elevate the soul;
Maro, who, warmed with all the poet's fire, Disputes the palm of victory with his sire :
Nor fear my rustic clerks;
read as they will, The bard, the bard, shall rise superior still !
Come then, my friend, an hour to pleasure spare, And quit awhile your business and your care ;
The day is all our own :
come, and forget Bonds, interest, all;
the credit and the debt;
Nay, e'en your wife :
though, with the dawning light, She left your couch, and late returned at night;
Though her loose hair in wild disorder flowed, Her eye yet glistened, and her cheek yet glowed, Her rumpled girdle busy hands exprest—
Yet, at my threshold, tranquillize your breast;
There leave the thoughts of home, and what the haste
Of heedless slaves may in your absence waste;
And, what the generous spirit most offends, 0, more than all, leave there, UNGRATEFUL FRIENDS.
But see!
the napkin, waved aloft, proclaims
The glad commencement of the Idæan games, And the proud prætor, in triumphal state, Ascends his car, the arbiter of fate !
Ere this, all Rome (if 'tis, for once, allowed, To say all Rome, of so immense a crowd) The Circus throngs, and—Hark !
loud shouts arise-
From these, I guess the GREEN has won the prize;
For had it lost, all joy had been supprest, And grief and horror seized the public breast;
As when dire Carthage forced our arms to yield, And poured our noblest blood on Cannæ's field.
Thither let youth, whom it befits, repair, And seat themselves beside some favourite fair, Wrangle, and urge the desperate bet aloud ;
While we, retired from business and the crowd, Stretch our shrunk limbs by sunny bank or stream, And drink, at every pore, the vernal beam.
Haste, then :
for we may use our freedom now,
And bathe, an hour ere noon, with fearless brow- Indulge for once :
-Yet such delights as these, In five short morns, would lose the power to please ;
For still, the sweetest pleasures soonest cloy, And its best flavour temperance gives to joy.
NOT with such joy, Corvinus, I survey My natal hour, as this auspicious day;
This day, on which the festive turf demands
The promised victims, at my willing hands.
A snow-white lamb to Juno I decree, Another to Minerva ;
and to thee, Tarpeian Jove !
a steer, which, from afar, Shakes his long rope, and meditates the war.
'Tis a fierce animal, that proudly scorns
The dug, since first he tried his budding horns Against an oak ;
free mettled, and, in fine, Fit for the knife, and sacrificial wine.0, were my power but equal to my love, A nobler victim should my rapture prove!
A bull high fed, and boasting in his veins, The luscious juices of Clitumnus' plains, Fatter than fat Hispulla, huge and slow, Should fall, but fall beneath no common blow-
Fall for my friend, who now, from danger free, Revolves the recent perils of the sea ;
Shrinks at the roaring waves, the howling winds, And scarcely trusts the safety which he finds !
For not the gods' inevitable fire, The surging billows that to heaven aspire, Alone, perdition threat;
black clouds arise, And blot out all the splendour of the skies ;
Loud and more loud the thunder's voice is heard, And sulphurous fires flash dreadful on the yard.-
Trembled the crew, and, fixed in wild amaze, Saw the rent sails burst into sudden blaze ;
While shipwreck, late so dreadful, now appeared A refuge from the flames, more wished than feared.
Horror on horror!
earth, and sea, and skies, Convulsed, as when POETIC TEMPESTS rise!
From the same source another danger view, With pitying eye,—though dire alas!
not new ;
But known too well, as Isis' temples show, By many a pictured scene of votive woe ;
Isis, by whom the painters now are fed, Since our own gods no longer yield them bread !—
And such befell our friend :
for now a sea, Upsurging, poured tremendous o'er the lee, And filled the hold;
while, pressed by wave and wind, To right and left, by turns, the ship inclined :
Then, while Catullus viewed, with drooping heart, The storm prevailing o'er the pilot's art, He wisely hastened to compound the strife, And gave his treasure to preserve his life.
The beaver thus to scape his hunter tries,
And leaves behind the medicated prize ;
Happy to purchase, with his dearest blood, A timely refuge in the well-known flood."
Away with all that's mine," he cries, "away!"
And plunges in the deep, without delay, Purples, which soft Mæcenases might wear, Crimsons, deep-tinctured in the Bætic air, Where herbs, and springs of secret virtues, stain The flocks at feed, with Nature's richest grain.
With these, neat baskets from the Britons bought, Rare silver chargers by Parthenius wrought, A huge two-handed goblet, which might strain A Pholus, or a Fuscus' wife, to drain ;
Followed by numerous services of plate, Plain, and enchased ;
with cups of ancient date, In which, while at the city's strength he laughed, The wily chapman of Olynthus quaffed.
Yet show me, in this elemental strife, Another, who would barter wealth for life !—
Few GAIN TO LIVE, Corvinus, few or none, But, blind with avarice, LIVE TO GAIN alone.
Now had the deep devoured their richest store ;
Nor seems their safety nearer than before:
The last resource alone was unexplored-
To cut the mast and rigging by the board ;
Haply the vessel so might steadier ride
O'er the vexed surface of the raging tide.
Dire threats the impending blow, when, thus distrest, We sacrifice a part, to save the rest!
Go now, fond man, the faithless ocean brave, Commit your fortune to the wind and wave ;
Trust to a plank, and draw precarious breath, At most, seven inches from the jaws of death !
Go, but forget not that a storm may rise, And put up hatchets with your sea supplies.
But now the winds were hushed ;
the wearied main Sunk to repose, a calm, unruffled plain ;
For fate, superior to the tempest's power, Averted from my friend the mortal hour :
A whiter thread the cheerful Sisters spun, And lo, with favouring hands their spindles run!
Mild as the breeze of eve, a rising gale Rippled the wave, and filled their only sail;
Others the crew supplied, of vests combined, And spread to catch each vagrant breath of wind :
By aids like these, slow o'er the deep impelled, The shattered bark her course for Ostia held;
While the glad sun uprose, supremely bright, And hope returned with the returning light.
At length the heights, where, from Lavinum moved, Iülus built the city which he loved, Burst on the view;
auspicious heights!
whose name From a white sow and thirty sucklings came.
And now, the port they gain ;
the tower, whose ray Guides the poor wanderer o'er the watery way, And the huge mole, whose arms the waves embrace, And stretching, an immeasurable space, Far into Ocean's bosom, leave the coast, Till, in the distance, Italy is lost!-
Less wonderful the bays which Nature forms, And less secure against assailing storms :
Here rides the wave-worn bark, devoid of fear ;
For Baian skiffs might ply with safety here.
The joyful crew, with shaven crowns, relate
Their timely rescue from the jaws of fate ;
On every ill a pomp of words bestow, And dwell delighted on the tale of woe.
Go then, my boys-but let no boding strain Break on the sacred silence-dress the fane With garlands, bind the sod with ribands gay, And on the knives the salted offering lay :
This done, I'11 speed, myself the rites to share, And finish what remains, with pious care.
Then, hastening home, where chaplets of sweet flowers Bedeck my Lares, dear, domestic Powers!
I '11 offer incense there, and at the shrine
Of highest Jove, my father's god, and mine ;
There will I scatter every bud that blows,
And every tint the various violet knows.
All savours here of joy :
luxuriant bay }
O'ershades my portal, while the taper's ray Anticipates the feast, and chides the tardy day.
Nor think, Corvinus, interest fires my breast :
Catullus, for whose sake my house is drest, Has three sweet boys, who all such hopes destroy, And nobler views excite my boundless joy.
Yet who besides, on such a barren friend, Would waste a sickly pullet?
who would spend
So vast a treasure, where no hopes prevail, Or, for a FATHER, sacrifice a quail ?
—But should the symptoms of a slight disease
The childless Paccius or Gallita seize, Legions of flatterers to the fanes repair, And hang in rows their votive tablets there.
Nay, some with vows of hecatombs will come-
For yet no elephants are sold at Rome ;
The breed, to Latium and to us unknown, Is only found beneath the burning zone :
Thence to our shore, by swarthy Moors conveyed, They roam at large through the Rutulian shade, Kept for the imperial pleasure, envied fate !
And sacred from the subject, and the state.
Though their progenitors, in days of yore, Did worthy service, and to battle bore
Whole cohorts ;
taught the general's voice to know, And rush, themselves an army, on the foe.
But what avails their worth !
could gold obtain
So rare a creature, worth might plead in vain :
Novins, without delay, their blood would shed, To raise his Paccius from affliction's bed;
An offering, sacred to the great design, And worthy of the votary and the shrine !
Pacuvius, did our laws the crime allow, The fairest of his numerous slaves would vow ;
The blooming boy, the love-inspiring maid, With garlands crown, and to the temple lead;
Nay, seize his Iphigene, prepared to wed, And drag her to the altar, from the bed ;
Though hopeless, like the Grecian sire, to find, In happy hour, the substituted hind.
And who shall say my countryman does ill ?
A thousand ships are trifles to a Will!
For Paccius, should the fates his health restore, May cancel every item framed before, (Won by his friend's vast merits, and beset, On all sides, by the inextricable net,) And, in one line, convey plate, jewels, gold, Lands, every thing to him, " to have and hold."
With victory crowned, Pacuvius struts along, And smiles contemptuous on the baffled throng ;
Then counts his gains, and deems himself o'erpaid For the cheap murder of one wretched maid.
Health to the man!
and may he THUS get more Than Nero plundered !
pile his shining store
High, mountain high ;
in years a Nestor prove, And, loving none, ne'er know another's love!
MAN, wretched man, whene'er he stoops to sin, Feels, with the act, a strong remorse within ;
'Tis the first vengeance :
Conscience tries the cause, And vindicates the violated laws;
Though the bribed Prætor at their sentence spurn, And falsify the verdict of the Urn.
What says the world, not always, friend, unjust, Of his late injury, this breach of trust ?
That thy estate so small a loss can bear, And that the evil, now no longer rare, Is one of that inevitable set, Which man is born to suffer, and forget.
Then moderate thy grief;
'tis mean to show An anguish disproportioned to the blow.
But thou, so new to crosses, as to feel
The slightest portion of the slightest ill, Art fired with rage, because a friend forswears
The sacred pledge, intrusted to his cares.
What, thou, Calvinus, bear so weak a mind !
Thou, who hast left full three-score years behind!
Heaven, have they taught thee nothing!
nothing, friend !
And art thou grown grey-headed to no end !
—Wisdom, I know, contains a sovereign charm, To vanquish fortune, or at least disarm :
Blest they who walk in her unerring rule !—
Nor those unblest, who, tutored in life's school, Have learned of old experience to submit, And lightly bear the yoke they cannot quit.
What day so sacred, which no guilt profanes,
No secret fraud, no open rapine stains ?
What hour, in which no dark assassins prowl, Nor point the sword for hire, nor drug the bowl ?
THE GOOD, ALAS, ARE FEW! "
The valued file," Less than the gates of Thebes, the mouths of Nile!
For NOW an age is come, that teems with crimes, Beyond all precedent of former times;
An age so bad, that Nature cannot frame A metal base enough to give it name !
Yet you, indignant at a paltry cheat, Call heaven and earth to witness the deceit, With cries as deafening, as the shout that breaks
From the bribed audience, when Fæsidius speaks.
Dotard in nonage!
are you to be told
What loves, what graces, deck another's gold ?
Are you to learn, what peals of mirth resound, At your simplicity, from all around ?
When you step forth, and, with a serious air, Bid them abstain from perjury, and beware }
To tempt the altars,-for A GOD IS THERE !
Idle old man !
there was, indeed, a time, When the rude natives of this happy clime Cherished such dreams :
'twas ere the king of heaven, To change his sceptre for a scythe was driven;
Ere Juno yet the sweets of love had tried, Or Jove advanced beyond the caves of Ide.
'Twas when no gods indulged in sumptuous feasts, No Ganymede, no Hebe served the guests ;
No Vulcan, with his sooty labours foul, Limped round, officious, with the nectared bowl ;
But each in private dined :
'twas when the throng
Of godlings, now beyond the scope of song, The courts of heaven, in spacious ease, possest, And with a lighter load poor Atlas prest !—
Ere Neptune's lot the watery world obtained, Or Dis and his Sicilian consort reigned;
Ere Tityus and his ravening bird were known, Ixion's wheel, or Sisyphus's stone :
While yet the shades confessed no tyrant's power, And all below was one Elysian bower !
Vice was a phoenix in that blissful time, Believed, but never seen :
and 'twas a crime, Worthy of death, such awe did years engage, If manhood rose not up to reverend age, And youth to manhood, though a larger hoard Of hips and acorns graced the stripling's board.
Then, then was age so venerable thought,
That every day increase of honour brought;
And children, in the springing down, revered The sacred promise of a hoary beard!
Now, if a friend, miraculously just, Restore the pledge, with all its gathered rust, 'Tis deemed a portent, worthy to appear Among the wonders of the Tuscan year ;
A prodigy of faith, which threats the state, And a ewe lamb can scarcely expiate!-
Struck at the view, if now I chance to see A man of ancient worth and probity, To preguant mules the MONSTER I compare, Or fish upturned beneath the wondering share :
Anxious and trembling for the woe to come, As if a shower of stones had fallen on Rome ;
As if a swarm of bees, together clung, Down from the Capitol, thick-clustering, hung ;
Or Tiber, swollen to madness, burst away, And roll'd, a milky deluge, to the sea.
And dost thou at a trivial loss repine !
What, if another, by a friend like thine, Is stript of ten times more !
a third, again, Of what his bursting chest would scarce contain !
For 'tis so common, in this age of ours, So easy, to contemn the Immortal Powers, That, can we but elude man's searching eyes, We laugh to scorn the witness of the skies.
Mark, with how bold a voice, and fixed a brow, The villain dares his treachery disavow "
By the all-hallowed orb that flames above, I HAD IT NOT !
By the red bolts of Jove, By the winged shaft that laid the Centaur low, By Dian's arrows, by Apollo's bow, By the strong lance that Mars delights to wield, By Neptune's trident, by Minerva's shield, And every weapon that, to vengeance given, Stores the tremendous magazine of heaven!-
Nay, IF I HAD, I'll slay this son of mine, And eat his head, soused in Egyptian brine.
"There are, who think that chance is all in all, That no First Cause directs the eternal ball;
But that brute Nature, in her blind career, Varies the seasons, and brings round the year :
These rush to every shrine, with equal ease, And, owning none, swear by what Power you please.
Others believe, and but believe, a god, And think that punishment MAY follow fraud ;
Yet they forswear, and, reasoning on the deed, Thus reconcile their actions with their creed :
"
Let Isis storm, if to revenge inclined, And with her angry sistrum strike me blind, So, with my eyes, she ravish not my ore, But let me keep the pledge which I forswore.
Are putrid sores, catarrhs that seldom kill, And crippled limbs, forsooth, so great an ill!
Ladas, if not stark mad, would change, no doubt, His flying feet for riches and the gout ;
For what do those procure him ?
mere renown,
And the starved honour of an olive crown."
But grant the wrath of heaven be great;
'tis slow, And days, and months, and years, precede the blow.
If, then, to punish ALL, the gods decree, When, in their vengeance, will they come to me ?
But I, perhaps, their anger may appease-
For they are wont to pardon faults like these :
At worst, there's hope;
since every age and clime
See different fates attend the self-same crime ;
Some made by villany, and some undone, And this ascend a scaffold, that a throne.
"These sophistries, to fix awhile suffice
The mind, yet shuddering at the thought of vice ;
And, thus confirmed, at the first call they come, Nay, rush before you to the sacred dome :
Chide your slow pace, drag you, amazed, along, And play the raving Phasma, to the throng.
(For impudence the vulgar suffrage draws, And seems the assurance of a righteous cause.)
While you, poor wretch, suspected by the crowd, With Stentor's lungs, or Mars', exclaim aloud :
" Jove!
Jove! will nought thy indignation rouse?
Canst thou, in silence, hear these faithless vows ?
When all thy fury, on the slaves accurst, From lips of marble or of brass should burst!-
Or else, why burn we incense at thy shrine, And heap thy altars with the fat of swine, When we might crave redress, for aught I see, As wisely of Bathyllus as of thee !
"Rash mail!-but hear, in turn, what I propose, To mitigate, if not to heal, your woes ;
I, who no knowledge of the schools possess, Cynic, or Stoic, differing but in dress, Or thine, calm Epicurus, whose pure mind To one small garden every wish confined.
In desperate cases, able doctors fee;
But trust your pulse to Philip's boy—or me.
If no example of so foul a deed
On earth be found, I urge no more :
proceed,
And beat your breast, and rend your hoary hair ;
'Tis just :
-for thus our losses we declare ;
And money is bewailed with deeper sighs, Than friends or kindred, and with louder cries.
There none dissemble, none, with scenic art, Affect a sorrow, foreign from the heart;
Content in squalid garments to appear, And vex their lids for one hard-gotten tear :
No, genuine drops fall copious from their eyes, And their breasts labour with unbidden sighs.
But when you see each court of justice thronged With crowds, like you, by faithless friendship wronged, See men abjure their bonds, though duly framed, And oft revised, by all the parties named, While their own hand and seal, in every eye, Flash broad conviction, and evince the lie ;
Shall you alone on Fortune's smiles presume, And claim exemption from the common doom ?
-From a white lien, forsooth, 'twas yours to spring, Ours, to be hatched beneath some luckless wing!
Pause from your grief, and, with impartial eyes, Survey the daring crimes which round you rise ;
Your injuries, then, will scarce deserve a name, And your false friend be half absolved from blame !
What's he, poor knave !
to those who stab for hire, Who kindle, and then spread, the midnight fire ?
Say, what to those who, from the hoary shrine, Tear the huge vessels age bath stamped divine, Offerings of price, by grateful nations given, And crowns inscribed, by pious kings, to heaven ?
What to the minor thieves, who, missing these, Abrade the gilded thighs of Hercules, Strip Neptune of his silvery beard, and peel Castor's leaf gold, where spread from head to heel ?
Or what to those, who, with pernicious craft, Mingle and set to sale the deadly draught;
Or those, who in a raw ox-hide are bound, And, with an ill-starred ape, poor sufferer ! drowned ?
Yet these-how small a portion of the crimes, That stain the records of those dreadful times, And Gallicus, the city prefect, hears, From light's first dawning, till it disappears!
The state of morals would you learn at Rome ?
No further seek than his judicial dome :
Give one short morning to the horrors there, And then complain, then murmur, if you dare!
Say, whom do goitres on the Alps surprise ?
In Meroë, whom the breast's enormous size ?
Whom locks, in Germany, of golden hue, And spiral curls, and eyes of sapphire blue ?
None ;
for the prodigy, among them shared, Becomes mere nature, and escapes regard.
When clouds of Thracian birds obscure the sky, To arms!
to arms !
the desperate Pigmies cry :
But soon, defeated in the unequal fray, Disordered flee ;
while, pouncing on their prey, The victor cranes descend, and, clamouring, bear The wriggling mannikins aloft in air.
Here, could our climes to such a scene give birth, We all should burst with agonies of mirth ;
There, unsurprised, they view the frequent fight, Nor smile at heroes scarce a foot in height."
Shall then no ill the perjured bead attend, No punishment o'ertake this faithless friend ? "
Suppose him seized, abandoned to your will, What more would rage ?
to torture or to kill;
Yet still your loss, your injury would remain, And draw no retribution from his pain. "
True ;
but methinks the smallest drop of blood, Squeezed from his mangled limbs, would do me good :
Revenge, THEY SAY, and I believe their words, A pleasure sweeter far than life affords."
WHO SAY ?
the fools, whose passions, prone to ire, At slightest causes, or at none take fire ;
Whose boiling breasts, at every turn, o'erflow With rancorous gall :
Chrysippus SAID not so;
Nor Thales, to our frailties clement still;
Nor that old man, by sweet Hymettus' hill, Who drank the poison with unruffled soul, And dying, from his foes withheld the bowl.
Divine philosophy !
by whose pure light
We first distinguish, then pursue the right, Thy power the breast from every error frees, And weeds out all its vices by degrees :
—
Illumined by thy beam, revenge we find, The abject pleasure of an abject mind, } And hence so dear to poor, weak, woman-kind.
But why are those, Calvinus, thought to scape Unpunished, whom, in every fearful shape, Guilt still alarms, and conscience, ne'er asleep, Wounds with incessant strokes, " not loud but deep," While the vexed mind, her own tormentor, plies A scorpion scourge, unmarked by human eyes!
Trust me, no tortures which the poets feign, Can match the fierce, the unutterable pain He feels, who night and day, devoid of rest, Carries his own accuser in his breast.
A Spartan once the Oracle besought To solve a scruple which perplexed his thought, And plainly tell him, if be might forswear A purse, of old confided to his care.
Incensed, the priestess answered—“ Waverer, no!
Nor shalt thou, for the doubt, unpunished go."
With that, he hastened to restore the trust;
But fear alone, not virtue, made him just:
Hence, he soon proved the Oracle divine, And all the answer worthy of the shrine ;
For plagues pursued his race without delay, And swept them from the earth, like dust, away.
By such dire sufferings did the wretch atone
The crime of meditated fraud alone !
For, IN THE EYE OF HEAVEN, a wicked deed Devised, is done :
What, then, if we proceed ?—
Perpetual fears the offender's peace destroy, And rob the social hour of all its joy :
Feverish, and parched, he chews, with many a pause, The tasteless food, that swells beneath his jaws :
Spits out the produce of the Albanian hill, Mellowed by age;
—you bring him mellower still, And lo, such wrinkles on his brow appear, As if you brought Falernian vinegar !
At night, should sleep his harassed limbs compose, And steal him one short moment from his woes, Then dreams invade ;
-sudden, before his eyes
The violated fane and altar rise;
And (what disturbs him most) your injured shade, In more than mortal majesty arrayed, Frowns on the wretch, alarms his treacherous rest, And wrings the dreadful secret from his breast.
These, these are they, who tremble and turn pale
At the first mutterings of the hollow gale!
Who sink with terror at the transient glare
Of meteors, glancing through the turbid air!
Oh, 'tis not chance, they cry ;
this hideous crash not the war of winds;
nor this dread flash
The encounter of dark clouds ;
but blasting fire, Charged with the wrath of heaven's insulted sire!
That dreaded peal, innoxious, dies away;
Shuddering, they wait the next with more dismay, As if the short reprieve were only sent To add new horrors to their punishment.
Yet more ;
when the first symptoms of disease, When feverish heats, their restless members seize, They think the plague by wrath divine bestowed, And feel, in every pang, the avenging God.
Racked at the thought, in hopeless grief they lie, And dare not tempt the mercy of the sky :
For what can such expect!
what victim slay, That is not worthier far to live than they!
With what a rapid change of fancy roll
The varying passions of the guilty soul !-
Bold to offend, they scarce commit the offence, Ere the mind labours with an innate sense
Of right and wrong ;
-not long, for nature still, Incapable of change, and fixed in ill, Recurs to her old habits :
-never yet Could sinner to his sin a period set.
When did the flush of modest blood inflame
The cheek, once hardened to the sense of shame ?
Or when the offender, since the birth of time, Retire, contented with a single crime ?
And this false friend of ours shall still pursue
His dangerous course, till vengeance, doubly due, O'ertake his guilt;
then shalt thou see him cast
In chains, 'mid tortures to expire his last;
Or hurried off, to join the wretched train Of exiled great ones in the Ægean main.
THIS, THOU SHALT SEE ;
and, while thy voice applauds
The dreadful justice of the offended gods, Reform thy creed, and, with an humble mind, Confess that Heaven is NEITHER DEAF NOR BLIND!
YES, there are faults, Fuscinus, that disgrace
The noblest qualities of birth and place ;
Which, like infectious blood, transmitted, run, In one eternal stream, from sire to son.
If, in destructive play, the senior waste
His joyous nights, the child, with kindred taste, Repeats, in miniature, the darling vice, Shakes the small box, and cogs the little dice.
Nor does that infant fairer hopes inspire, Who, trained by the grey epicure, his sire, Has learned to pickle mushrooms, and, like him, To souse the beccaficos, till they swim !—
For take him, thus to early luxury bred, Ere twice four springs have blossomed o'er his head, And let ten thousand teachers, hoar with age, Inculcate temperance from the stoic page ;
His wish will ever be, in state to dine, And keep his kitchen's honour from decline !
Does Rutilus inspire a generous mind, Prone to forgive, and to slight errors blind ;
Instil the liberal thought, that slaves have powers, Sense, feeling, all, as exquisite as ours;
Or fury ?
He, who hears the sounding thong With far more pleasure than the Syren's song;
Who, the stern tyrant of his small domain, The Polypheme of his domestic train, Knows no delight, save when the torturer's hand Stamps, for low theft, the agonizing brand.- 0, what but rage can fill that stripling's breast, Who sees his savage sire then only blest, When his stretched ears drink in the wretches' cries, And racks and prisons fill his vengeful eyes !
And dare we hope, yon girl, from Larga sprung, Will e'er prove virtuous ;
when her little tongue Ne'er told so fast her mother's wanton train, But that she stopt and breathed, and stopt again ?
Even from her tender years, unnatural trust!
The child was privy to the matron's lust :
-
Scarce ripe for man, with her own hand, she writes
The billets, which the ancient bawd indites, Employs the self-same pimps, and looks, ere long, To share the visits of the amorous throng!
So Nature prompts :
drawn by her secret tie, We view a parent's deeds with reverent eye;
With fatal haste, alas!
the example take, And love the sin, for the dear sinner's sake.-
One youth, perhaps, formed of superior clay, And warmed, by Titan, with a purer ray, May dare to slight proximity of blood, And, in despite of nature, to be good :
One youth—the rest the beaten pathway tread, And blindly follow where their fathers led.
O fatal guides!
this reason should suffice
To win you from the slippery route of vice, This powerful reason;
lest your sons pursue
The guilty track, thus plainly marked by you !
For youth is facile, and its yielding will Receives, with fatal ease, the imprint of ill :
Hence Catilines in every clime abound ;
But where are Cato and his nephew found!
Swift from the roof where youth, Fuscinus, dwell, Immodest sights, immodest sounds expel;
THE PLACE IS SACRED :
Far, far hence, remove, Ye venal votaries of illicit love!
Ye dangerous knaves, who pander to be fed, And sell yourselves to infamy for bread !
REVERENCE TO CHILDREN, AS TO HEAVEN, IS DUE :
When you would, then, some darling sin pursue, Think that your infant offspring eyes the deed;
And let the thought abate your guilty speed, Back from the headlong steep your steps entice, And check you, tottering on the verge of vice.
O yet reflect!
for should he e'er provoke, In riper age, the law's avenging stroke, (Since not alone in person and in face, But even in morals, he will prove his race, And, while example acts with fatal force, Side, nay outstrip, you, in the vicious course,) Vexed, you will rave and storm ;
perhaps, prepare, Should threatening fail, to name another heir!
-Audacious ! with what front do you aspire
To exercise the license of a sire ?
When all, with rising indignation, view The youth, in turpitude, surpassed by you, By you, old fool, whose windy, brainless head, Long since required the cupping-glass's aid !
Is there a guest expected ?
all is haste,
All hurry in the house, from first to last. "
Sweep the dry cobwebs down! " the master cries,
Whips in his hand, and fury in his eyes, " Let not a spot the clouded columns stain ;
Scour you the figured silver;
you, the plain !
"O inconsistent wretch !
is all this coil, Lest the front hall, or gallery, daubed with soil, (Which, yet, a little sand removes,) offend
The prying eye of some indifferent friend ?
And do you stir not, that your son may see
The house from moral filth, from vices free !
True, you have given a citizen to Rome;
And she shall thank you, if the youth become, By your o'er-ruling care, or soon or late, A useful member of the parent state :
For all depends on you ;
the stamp he'll take, From the strong impress which, at first, you make ;
And prove, as vice or virtue was your aim, His country's glory, or his country's shame.
The stork, with snakes and lizards from the wood, And pathless wild, supports her callow brood ;
And the fledged storklings, when to wing they take, Seek the same reptiles, through the devious brake.
The vulture snuffs from far the tainted gale, And, hurrying where the putrid scents exhale, From gibbets and from graves the carcass tears, And to her young the loathsome dainty bears ;
Her young, grown vigorous, hasten from the nest, And gorge on carrion with the parent's zest.
While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood, Scours the wide champaign for untainted food, Bears the swift hare or swifter fawn away, And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey;
Her nestlings hence, when from the rock they spring, And, pinched by hunger, to the quarry wing, Stoop only to the game they tasted first, When, clamorous, from the shell, to light they burst.
Centronius planned and built, and built and planned ;
And now along Cajeta's winding strand, And now amid Præneste's hills, and now On lofty Tibur's solitary brow, He reared prodigious piles, with marble brought From distant realms, and exquisitely wrought:
Prodigious piles!
that towered o'er Fortune's shrine, As those of gelt Posides, Jove, o'er thine !
While thus Centronius crowded seat on seat, He spent his cash, and mortgaged his estate;
Yet left enough his family to content:
Which his mad son, to the last farthing, spent, While, building on, he strove, with fond desire, To shame the stately structures of his sire !
Sprung from a father who the sabbath fears, There is, who nought but clouds and skies reveres ;
And shuns the taste, by old tradition led, Of human flesh, and swine's, with equal dread :
—
This first :
the prepuce next he lays aside, And, taught the Roman ritual to deride, Clings to the Jewish, and observes with awe All Moses bade in his mysterious law :
And, therefore, to the circumcised alone Will point the road, or make the fountain known ;
Warned by his bigot sire, who whiled away, Sacred to sloth, each seventh revolving day.
But youth, so prone to follow other ills, Are driven to AVARICE, against their wills;
For this grave vice, assuming Virtue's guise, Seems Virtue's self, to undiscerning eyes.
The miser, hence, a frugal man, they name ;
And hence, they follow, with their whole acclaim, The griping wretch, who strictlier guards his store, Than if the Hesperian dragon kept the door.-
Add that the vulgar, stilla slave to gold, The worthy, in the wealthy, man behold ;
And, reasoning from the fortune be has made, Hail him, A perfect master of his trade !
And true, indeed, it is-such MASTERS raise Immense estates ;
no matter, by what ways ;
But raise they do, with brows in sweat still dyed, With forge still glowing, and with sledge still plied.
The father, by the love of wealth possest, Convinced-the covetous alone are blest, And that, nor past, nor present times, e'er knew A poor man happy,-bids his son pursue
The paths they take, the courses they affect, And follow, at the heels, this thriving sect.
Vice boasts its elements, like other arts;
These, he inculcates first:
anon, imparts
The petty tricks of saving;
last, inspires, Of endless wealth, the insatiable desires.-
Hungry himself, his hungry slaves he cheats, With scanty measures, and unfaithful weights ;
And sees them lessen, with increasing dread, The flinty fragments of his vinewed bread.
In dog-days, when the sun, with fervent power, Corrupts the freshest meat from hour to hour, He saves the last night's hash, sets by a dish Of sodden beans, and scraps of summer fish, And half a stinking shad, and a few strings
Of a chopped leek—all told, like sacred things,
And sealed with caution, though the sight and smell Would a starved beggar from the board repel.
But why this dire avidity of gain ?
This mass collected with such toil and pain ?
Since 'tis the veriest madness, to live poor, And die with bags and coffers running o'er.
Besides, while thus the streams of affluence roll, They nurse the eternal dropsy of the soul, For thirst of wealth still grows with wealth increast, And they desire it less, who have it least.
-Now swell his wants :
one manor is too small, Another must be bought, house, lands, and all;
Still " cribbed confined," he spurns the narrow bounds, And turns an eye on every neighbour's grounds :
There all allures;
his crops appear a foil To the rich produce of their happier soil. "
And this, I'll purchase, with the grove," he cries, " And that fair hill, where the grey olives rise."
Then, if the owner to no price will yield, (Resolved to keep the hereditary field,) Whole droves of oxen, starved to this intent, Among his springing corn, by night, are sent, To revel there, till not a blade be seen, And all appear like a close-shaven green.
" Monstrous ! " you say-And yet, 'twere hard to tell, What numbers, tricks like these have forced to sell.
But, sure, the general voice has marked his name, And given him up to infamy and shame :
— "
And what of that ? " he cries. " I valued more A single lupine, added to my store, Than all the country's praise;
if cursed by fate With the scant produce of a small estate."—
'Tis well!
no more shall age or grief annoy, But nights of peace succeed to days of joy, If more of ground to you alone pertain, Than Rome possest, in Numa's pious reign !
Since then, the veteran, whose brave breast was gored, By the fierce Pyrrhic, or Molossian sword, Hardly received for all his service past, And all his wounds, TWO ACRES at the last;
The meed of toil and blood!
yet never thought
His country thankless, or his pains ill bought.
For then, this little glebe, improved with care, Largely supplied, with vegetable fare, The good old man, the wife in childbed laid, And four hale boys, that round the cottage played, Three free-born, one a slave :
while, on the board, Huge porringers, with wholesome pottage stored, Smoked for their elder brothers, who were now, Hungry and tired, expected from the plough.-
Two ACRES will not now, so changed the times, Afford a garden-plot :
-and hence our crimes !
For not a vice that taints the human soul, More frequent points the sword, or drugs the bowl, Than the dire lust of an " untamed estate "— Since, he who covets wealth, disdains to wait :
Law threatens, Conscience calls-yet on he hies, And this he silences, and that defies, Fear, Shame,—he bears down all, and, with loose rein, Sweeps headlong o'er the alluring paths of gain !"
Let us, my sons, contented with our lot, Enjoy, in peace, our hillock and our cot," (The good old Marsian to his children said,) . " And from our labour seek our daily bread.
So shall we please the rural Powers, whose care, And kindly aid, first taught us to prepare
The golden grain, what time we ranged the wood, A savage race, for acorns, savage food !
The poor who, with inverted skins, defy
The lowering tempest and the freezing sky, Who, without shame, without reluctance go, In clouted brogues, through mire and drifted snow, Ne'er think of ill :
'tis purple, boys, alone, Which leads to guilt,-purple, to us unknown.
"Thus, to their children, spoke the sires of yore.
Now, autumn's sickly heats are scarcely o'er, Ere, while deep midnight yet involves the skies, The impatient father shakes his son, and cries, " What, bo, boy, wake !
Up ;
pleas, rejoinders draw, Turn o'er the rubric of our ancient law;
Up, up, and study :
or, with brief in hand, Petition Lælius for a small command, A captain's!
—Lælius loves a spreading chest, Broad shoulders, tangled locks, and hairy breast.
The British towers, the Moorish tents destroy, And the rich Eagle, at threescore, enjoy !"
But if the trump, prelusive to the fight, And the long labours of the camp affright, Go, look for merchandise of readiest vent, Which yields a sure return of cent.
per cent.
Buy this, no matter what;
the ware is good, Though not allowed on this side Tiber's flood :
Hides, unguents, mark me, boy, are equal things, And gain smells sweet, from whatsoe'er it springs.
This golden sentence, which the Powers of heaven, Which Jove himself, might glory to have given, Will never, never, from your thoughts, I trust,- NONE QUESTION WHENCE IT COMES;
BUT COME IT MUST."
This, when the lisping race a farthing ask, Old women set them, as a previous task ;
The wondrous apophthegm all run to get, And learn it sooner than their alphabet.
But why this haste ?
Without your care, vain fool!
The pupil will, ere long, the tutor school:
Sleep, then, in peace;
secure to be outdone, Like Telamon, or Peleus, by your son.
0, yet indulge awhile his tender years :
The seeds of vice, sown by your fostering cares, Have scarce ta'en root;
but they will spring at length, " Grow with his growth, and strengthen with his strength."
Then, when the firstlings of his youth are paid, And his rough chin requires the razor's aid, Then he will swear, then to the altar come, And sell deep perjuries for a paltry sum !—
Believe your step-daughter already dead, If, with an ample dower, she mount his bed :
Lo !
scarcely laid, his murderous fingers creep, And close her eyes in everlasting sleep.
For that vast wealth which, with long years of pain,
You thought would be acquired by land and main, He gets a readier way :
the skill's not great, The toil not much, to make a knave complete.
But you will say hereafter, " I am free:
He never learned those practices of me."
Yes, all of you :
-for he who, madly blind, Imbues with avarice his children's mind, Fires with the thirst of riches, and applauds
The attempt, to double their estate by frauds, Unconscious, flings the headlong wheels the rein, Which he may wish to stop, but wish in vain ;
Deaf to his voice, with growing speed they roll, Smoke down the steep, and spurn the distant goal!
None sin by rule ;
none heed the charge precise, THUS, AND NO FURTHER, MAY YE STEP IN VICE ;
But leap the bounds prescribed, and, with free pace, Scour far and wide the interdicted space.
So, when you tell the youth, that FOOLS alone Regard a friend's distresses as their own;
You bid the willing hearer riches raise, By fraud, by rapine, by the worst of ways ;
Riches, whose love is on your soul imprest, Deep as their country's on the Decii's breast;
Or Thebes on his, who sought an early grave, (If Greece say true,) her sacred walls to save.
Thebes, where, impregned with serpents' teeth, the earth Poured forth a marshalled host, prodigious birth !
Horrent with arms, that fought with headlong rage, Nor asked the trumpet's signal, to engage.-
But mark the end !
the fire, derived, at first, From a small sparkle, by your folly nurst, Blown to a flame, on all around it preys, And wraps you in the universal blaze.
So the young lion rent, with hideous roar, His keeper's trembling limbs, and drank his gore."
Tush!
I am safe," you cry;
" Chaldæan seers Have raised my Scheme, and promised length of years."
But has your son subscribed ?
will he await
The lingering distaff of decrepit Fate ?
No ;
—his impatience will the work confound, And snap the vital thread, ere half unwound.
Even now your long and stag-like age annoys
His future hopes, and palls his present joys.
Fly then, and bid Archigenes prepare An antidote, if life be worth your care ;
If you would see another autumn close, And pluck another fig, another rose :
—
Take mithridate, rash man, before your meat, A FATHER, you ?
and without medicine eat!
Come, my Fuscinus, come with me, and view A scene more comic than the stage e'er knew.
Lo! with what toil, what danger, wealth is sought, And to the fane of watchful Castor brought;
Since MARS THE AVENGER slumbered, to his cost, And, with his helmet, all his credit lost !
Quit then the plays!
the FARCE OF LIFE supplies A scene more comic in the sage's eyes.
For who amuses most ?-the man who springs, Light, through the hoop, and on the tight-rope swings ;
Or he, who, to a fragile bark confined, Dwells on the deep, the sport of wave and wind ?
Fool-hardy wretch !
scrambling for every bale
Of stinking merchandise, exposed to sale ;
And proud to Crete, for ropy wine, to rove, And jars, the fellow citizens of Jove!
THAT skips along the rope, with wavering tread, Dangerous dexterity, which brings him bread;
THIS ventures life, for wealth too vast to spend, Farm joined to farm, and villas without end !
Lo, every harbour thronged and every bay, And half mankind upon the watery way!
For, where he bears the attractive voice of gain, The merchant hurries, and defies the main.-
Nor will he only range the Libyan shore, But, passing Calpé, other worlds explore :
See Phœbus, sinking in the Atlantic, lave His fiery car, and hear the hissing wave.
And all for what ?
0 glorious end!
to come,
His toils o'erpast, with purse replenished, home, And, with a traveller's privilege, vent his boasts, Of unknown monsters seen on unknown coasts.
What varying forms in madness may we trace !—
Safe in his loved Electra's fond embrace, Orestes sees the avenging Furies rise, And flash their bloody torches in his eyes ;
While Ajax strikes an ox.
and, at the blow, Hears Agamemnon or Ulysses low :
And surely he (though, haply, he forbear, Like these, his keeper and his clothes to tear) just as mad, who to the water's brim Loads his frail bark-a plank 'twixt death and him!
When all this risk is but to swell his store With a few coins, a few gold pieces more.
Heaven lours, and frequent, through the muttering air, The nimble lightning glares, or seems to glare :
" Weigh!
weigh ! " the impatient man of traffic cries, " These gathering clouds, this rack that dims the skies, Are but the pageants of a sultry day;
A thunder shower, that frowns, and melts away."
Deluded wretch !
dashed on some dangerous coast, This night, this hour, perhaps, his bark is lost;
While he still strives, though whelmed beneath the wave, His darling purse with teeth or hand to save.
Thus he, who sighed, of late, for all the gold Down the bright Tagus and Pactolus rolled, Now bounds his wishes to one poor request, A scanty morsel and a tattered vest;
And shows, where tears, where supplications fail, A daubing of his melancholy tale !
Wealth, by such dangers earned, such anxious pain, Requires more care to keep it, than to gain:
Whate'er my miseries, make me not, kind Fate, The sleepless Argus of a vast estate!
The slaves of Licinus, a numerous band, Watch through the night, with buckets in their hand, While their rich master trembling lies, afraid Lest fire his ivory, amber, gold, invade.
The naked Cynic mocks such restless cares, His earthen tub no conflagration fears;
If cracked, to-morrow he procures a new, Or, coarsely soldering, makes the old one do.
Even Philip's son, when, in his little cell Content, he saw the mighty master dwell, Owned, with a sigh, that he, who nought desired, Was happier far, than he who worlds required, And whose ambition certain dangers brought, Vast, and unbounded, as the object sought.-
Fortune, advanced to heaven by fools alone, Would lose, were wisdom ours, her shadowy throne."
What call I, then, ENOUGH ? "
What will afford A decent habit, and a frugal board ;
What Epicurus' little garden bore, And Socrates sufficient thought, before :
These squared by Nature's rules their blameless life- Nature and Wisdom never are at strife.
You think, perhaps, these rigid means too scant, And that I ground philosophy on want;
Take then, (for I will be indulgent now, And something for the change of times allow,) As much as Otho for a knight requires :
—
If this, unequal to your wild desires, Contract your brow ;
enlarge the sum, and take As much as two,-as much as three-will make.
If yet, in spite of this prodigious store, Your craving bosom yawn, unfilled, for more, Then, all the wealth of Lydia's king, increast ,By all the treasures of the gorgeous East, Will not content you ;
no, nor all the gold Of that proud slave, whose mandate Rome controlled, Who swayed the Emperor, and whose fatal word Plunged in the Empress' breast the lingering sword !
WHO knows not to what monstrous gods, my friend, The mad inhabitants of Egypt bend ?—
The snake-devouring ibis, these enshrine, Those think the crocodile alone divine;
Others, where Thebes' vast ruins strew the ground, And shattered Memnon yields a magic sound, Set up a glittering brute of uncouth shape, And bow before the image of an ape!
Thousands regard the hound with holy fear, Not one, Diana :
and 'tis dangerous here, To violate an onion, or to stain The sanctity of leeks with tooth profane.
O holy nations !
Sacro-sanct abodes !
Where every garden propagates its gods !
They spare the fleecy kind, and think it ill, The blood of lambkins, or of kids, to spill :
But, human flesh—O! that is lawful fare, And you may eat it without scandal there.
When, at the amazed Alcinous' board, of old, Ulysses of so strange an action told, He moved of some the mirth, of more the gall, And, for a lying vagrant, passed with all. “ Will no one plunge this babbler in the waves, (Worthy a true Charybdis,)—while he raves
Of monsters seen not since the world began, Cyclops and Læstrigons, who feed on man!
For me—I less should doubt of Scylla's train, Of rocks that float and jostle in the main, Of bladders filled with storms, of men, in fine, By magic changed, and driven to grunt with swine, Than of his cannibals :
-the fellow feigns, As if he thought Phæacians had no brains.
"Thus, one, perhaps, more sober than the rest, Observed, and justly, of their travelled guest, Who spoke of prodigies till then unknown;
Yet brought no attestation but his own.
—I bring my wonders, too ;
and I can tell, When Junius, late, was consul, what befell, Near Coptus' walls;
tell of a people stained With deeper guilt than tragedy e'er feigned:
For, sure, no buskined bard, from Pyrrha's time, E'er taxed a whole community with crime ;
Take then a scene yet to the stage unknown, And, by a nation, acted—IN OUR OWN!
Between two neighbouring towns a deadly hate, Sprung from a sacred grudge of ancient date, Yet burns;
a hate no lenients can assuage, No time subdue, a rooted, rancorous rage!
Blind bigotry, at first, the evil wrought:
For each despised the other's gods, and thought Its own the true, the genuine, in a word, The only deities to be adored !
And now the Ombite festival drew near:
When the prime Tent'rites, envious of their cheer, Resolved to seize the occasion, to annoy Their feast, and spoil the sacred week of joy.—
It came :
the hour the thoughtless Ombites greet, And crowd the porches, crowd the public street, With tables richly spread ;
where, night and day, Plunged in the abyss of gluttony, they lay :
(For savage as the nome appears, it vies In luxury, if I MAY TRUST MY EYES, With dissolute Canopus:
)
Six were past, Six days of riot, and the seventh and last Rose on the feast:
arid now the Tent'rites thought, A cheap, a bloodless victory might be bought, O'er such a helpless crew;
nor thought they wrong, Nor could the event be doubtful, where a throng
Of drunken revellers, stammering, reeling-ripe, And capering to a sooty minstrel's pipe, Coarse unguents, chaplets, flowers, on this side fight;
On that, keen hatred, and deliberate spite!
At first both sides, though eager to engage, With taunts and jeers, the heralds of their rage, Blow up their mutual fury ;
and anon, Kindled to madness, with loud shouts rush on ;
Deal, though unarmed, their vengeance blindly round, And with clenched fists print many a ghastly wound.
Then might you see, amid the desperate fray, Features disfigured, noses torn away, Hands, where the gore of mangled eyes yet reeks, And jaw-bones starting through the cloven cheeks!
But this is sport, mere children's play, they cry—
As yet beneath their feet no bodies lie, And, to what purpose should such armies fight
The cause of heaven, if none be slain outright ?
Roused at the thought, more fiercely they engage, With stones, the weapons of intestine rage ;
Yet not precisely such, to tell you true, As Turnus erst, or mightier Ajax, threw:
Nor quite so large as that two-banded stone, Which bruised Æneas on the huckle-bone ;
But such as men, in our degenerate days, Ah, how unlike to theirs!
make shift to raise.
Even in his time, Mæonides could trace Some diminution of the human race :
Now, earth, grown old and frigid, rears with pain A pigmy brood, a weak and wicked train ;
Which every god, who marks their passions vile, Regards with laughter, though he loathes the while.
But to our tale.
Enforced with armed supplies,
The zealous Tent'rites feel their courage rise, And wave their swords, and, kindling at the sight, Press on, and with fell rage renew the fight.
The Ombites flee ;
they follow :
-in the rear, A luckless wretch, confounded by his fear, Trips and falls headlong ;
with loud yelling cries, The pack rush in, and seize him as he lies.
And now the conquerors, none to disappoint
Of the dire banquet, tear him joint by joint, And dole him round;
the bones yet warm, they gnaw, And champ the flesh that heaves beneath their jaw.
They want no cook to dress it—'twould be long, And appetite is keen, and rage is strong.
And here, Volusius, I rejoice at least, That fire was unprofaned by this cursed feast, Fire, rapt from heaven!
and you will, sure, agree
To greet the element's escape, with me.
-But all who ventured on the carcass, swore
They never tasted-aught so sweet before !
Nor did the relish charm the first alone-
Those who arrived too late for flesh, or bone, Stooped down, and scraping where the wretch had lain, With savage pleasure licked the gory plain!
The Vascons once, (the story yet is rife,) With such dire sustenance prolonged their life ;
t then the cause was different:
Fortune, there, Proved adverse :
they had borne the extremes of war, The rage of famine, the still-watchful foe, And all the ills beleaguered cities know.
(And nothing less should prompt mankind to use Such desperate means.)
May this their crime excuse !
For after every root and herb were gone,
And every aliment to hunger known ;
When their lean frames, and cheeks of sallow hue, Struck even the foe with pity at the view, And all were ready their own flesh to tear, They first adventured on this horrid fare.
And surely every god would pity grant
To men so worn by wretchedness and want, And even the very ghosts of those they ate, Absolve them, mindful of their dreadful state!
True, we are wiser;
and, by Zeno taught, J Know life itself may be too dearly bought;
But the poor Vascon, in that early age, Knew nought of Zeno, or the Stoic page.-
Now, thanks to Greece and Rome, in wisdom's robe
The bearded tribes rush forth, and seize the globe :
Already, learned Gaul aspires to teach Your British orators the Art of Speech ;
And Thule, blessings on her !
seems to say, She'll hire a good grammarian, cost what may.
The Vascons, then, who thus prolonged their breath, And the Saguntines, true, like them, to death, Brave too, like them, but by worse ills subdued, Had some small plea for this abhorred food.
Diana first, (and let us doubt no more
The barbarous rites we disbelieved of yore,) Reared her dread altar near the Tauric flood, And asked the sacrifice of human blood :
Yet there the victim only lost his life, And feared no cruelty beyond the knife.
Far, far more savage Egypt's frantic train, They butcher first, and then devour the slain !
But say, what cause impelled them to proceed, What siege, what famine, to this monstrous deed ?
What could they more, had Nile refused to rise, And the soil gaped with ever-glowing skies, What could they more, the guilty Flood to shame, And heap opprobrium on his hateful name !
Lo !
what the barbarous hordes of Scythia, Thrace, Gaul, Britain, never dared-dared by a race
Of puny dastards, who, with fingers frail, Tui, the light oar, and hoist the little sail, In painted pans!
What tortures can the mind Suggest for miscreants of this abject kind, Whom spite impelled worse horrors to pursue, Than famine, in its deadliest form, e'er knew !
NATURE, who gave us tears, by that alone Proclaims she made the feeling heart our own ;
And 'tis her noblest boon :
This bids us fly, To wipe the drops from sorrowing friendship's eye, Sorrowing ourselves ;
to wail the prisoner's state, And sympathize in the wronged orphan's fate, Compelled his treacherous guardian to accuse, While many a shower his blooming cheek bedews, And through his scattered tresses, wet with tears, A doubtful face, or boy or girl's, appears.
As Nature bids, we sigh, when some bright maid Is, ere her spousals, to the pyre conveyed ;
Some babe-by fate's inexorable doom, Just shown on earth, and hurried to the tomb.
For who, that to the sanctity aspires Which Ceres, for her mystic torch, requires, Feels not another's woes ?
This marks our birth ;
The great distinction from the beasts of earth !
And therefore,—gifted with superior powers, And capable of things divine,—'tis ours, To learn, and practise, every useful art;
And, from high heaven, deduce that better part, That moral sense, denied to creatures prone, And downward bent, and found with man alone!
—
For He, who gave this vast machine to roll, Breathed LIFE in them, in us a REASONING SOUL;
That kindred feelings might our state improve, And mutual wants conduct to mutual love;
Woo to one spot the scattered hordes of men, From their old forest and paternal den ;
Raise the fair dome, extend the social line, And, to our mansion, those of others join, Join too our faith, our confidence to theirs, And sleep, relying on the general cares :
—
In war, that each to each support might lend, When wounded, succour, and when fallen, defend ;
At the same trumpet's clangour rush to arms, By the same walls be sheltered from alarms, Near the same tower the foe's incursions wait, And trust their safety to one common gate.
-But serpents, now, more links of concord bind :
The cruel leopard spares the spotted kind ;
No lion spills a weaker lion's gore, No boar expires beneath a stronger boar;
In leagues of friendship, tigers roam the plain, And bears with bears perpetual peace maintain.
While man, alas !
fleshed in the dreadful trade, Forges without remorse the murderous blade, On that dire anvil, where primæval skill, As yet untaught a brother's blood to spill, Wrought only what meek nature would allow, Goads for the ox, and coulters for the plough !
Even this is trifling :
we have seen a rage
Too fierce for murder only to assuage ;
Seen a whole state their victim piecemeal tear, And count each quivering limb delicious fare.
0, could the Samian Sage these horrors see, What would he say ?
or to what deserts flee ?
He, who the flesh of beasts, like man's, declined, And scarce indulged in pulse-of every kind !WHO can recount the advantages that wait, Dear Callus, on the Military State ?—
For let me once, beneath a lucky star, Faint as I am of heart, and new to war, But join the camp, and that ascendant hour Shall lord it o'er my fate with happier power, Than if a line from Venus should commend
My suit to Mars, or Juno stand my friend !
And first, of benefits which all may share :
'Tis somewhat-that no citizen shall dare To strike you, or, though struck, return the blow :
But wave the wrong ;
nor to the Prætor show His teeth dashed out, his face deformed with gore, And eyes no skill can promise to restore !
A Judge, if to the camp your plaints you bear, Coarse shod, and coarser greaved, awaits you there :
By antique law proceeds the cassocked sage, And rules prescribed in old Camillus' age ;
To Mit, Let soldiers seek no foreign bench.
Nor plead to any charge without the french.
O nicely do Centurions sift the cause, When buff-and-helt-men violate the laws!
And ample, if with reason we complain, Is, doubtless, the redress our injuries gain !
Even so :
-but the whole legion are our foes, And, with determined aim, the award oppose. "
These snivelling rogues take special pleasure still
To make the punishment outweigh the ill."
So runs the cry ;
and he must be possest
Of more, Vagellius, than thy iron breast, Who braves their anger, and, with ten poor toes, Defies such countless hosts of hobnailed shoes.
Who so untutored in the ways of Rome, Say, who so true a Pylades, to come Within the camp ?-no :
let thy tears be dried, Nor ask that kindness, which must be denied.
For, when the Court exclaims, " Your witness, here! " Let that firm friend, that man of men, appear, And testify but what he saw and heard;
And I pronounce him worthy of the beard And hair of our forefathers!
You may find False witnesses against an honest hind, Easier than true, (and who their fears can blame ?)
Against a soldier's purse, a soldier's fame!
But there are other benefits, my friend, And greater, which the sons of war attend:
Should a litigious neighbour bid me yield
My vale irriguous, and paternal field ;
Or from my bounds the sacred landmark tear, To which, with each revolving spring, I bear, In pious duty to the grateful soil, My humble offerings, honey, meal, and oil;
Or a vile debtor my just claims withstand, Deny his signet, and abjure his hand ;
Term after Term I wait, till months be past, And scarce obtain a hearing at the last.
Even when the hour is fixed, a thousand stays Retard my suit, a thousand vague delays :
The cause is called, the witnesses attend, Chairs brought, and cushions laid-and there an end!
Cæditius finds his cloak or gown too hot, And Fuscus slips aside to seek the pot;
Thus, with our dearest hopes the judges sport, And when we rise to speak, dismiss the Court!
But spear-and-shield-men may command the hour;
The time to plead is always in their power ;
Nor are their wealth and patience worn away, By the slow drag-chain of the law's delay.
Add that the soldier, while his father lives,
And he alone, his wealth bequeaths or gives ;
For what by pay is earned, by plunder won, The law declares, vests solely in the son.
Coranus therefore sees his hoary sire, To gain his Will, by every art, aspire!- HE rose by service ;
rank in fields obtained, And well deserved the fortune which he gained.
And every prudent chief must, sure, desire, That still the worthiest should the most acquire ;
That those who merit, their rewards should have, Trappings, and chains, and all that decks the brave.
80'TWAS never yet my luck, I ween, To drench my lips in Hippocrene ;
Nor, if I recollect aright, On the forked Hill to sleep a night, That I, like others of the trade, Might wake-a poet ready made !
Thee, Helicon, with all the Nine, And pale Pyrene, I resign, Unenvied, to the tuneful race, Whose busts (of many a fane the grace) Sequacious ivy climbs, and spreads Unfading verdure round their heads.
Enough for me, too mean for praise, To bear my rude, uncultured lays To Phœbus and the Muses' shrine, And place them near their gifts divine.
Who bade the parrot cry ;
And forced our language on χαι̃ρε the pie ?
The BELLY :
Master, he, of Arts, Bestower of ingenious parts ;
Powerful the creatures to endue With sounds their natures never knew!
For, let the wily hand unfold
The glittering bait of tempting gold, And straight the choir of daws and pies, To such poetic heights shall rise, That, lost in wonder, you will swear Apollo and the Nine are there !
ALAS, for man !
How vain are all his cares!
And oh !
what bubbles,, his most grave affairs !
Tush !
who will read such trite-Heavens!
this to me ?
Not one, by Jove.
Not one ?
Well, two, or three ;
Or rather—none :
a piteous case, in truth !
Why piteous ?
lest Polydamas, forsooth, And Troy's proud dames, pronounce my merits fall Beneath their Labeo's!
I can bear it all.
Nor should my friend, though still, as fashion sways, The purblind town conspire to sink or raise, Determine, as her wavering beam prevails, And trust his judgment to her coarser scales.
O not abroad for vague opinion roam ;
The wise man's bosom is his proper home :
And Rome is—What ?
Ah, might the truth be told !—
And, sure it may, it must.—When I behold
What fond pursuits have formed our prime employ, Since first we dropt the play-things of the boy, To grey maturity, to this late hour, When every brow frowns with censorial power, Then, thenO yet suppress this carping mood.
Impossible !
I could not if I would;
For nature framed me of satiric mould, And spleen, too petulant to be controlled.
Immured within our studies, we compose ;
Some, shackled metre;
some, free-footed prose ;
But all, bombast :
stuff, which the breast may strain, And the huge lungs puff forth with awkward pain.
'
Tis done !
and now the bard, elate and proud, Prepares a grand rehearsal for the crowd.
Lo !
be steps forth in birth-day splendour bright, Combed and perfumed, and robed in dazzling white;
And mounts the desk ;
his pliant throat he clears,
And deals, insidious, round his wanton leers :
While Rome's first nobles, by the prelude wrought, Watch, with indecent glee, each prurient thought, And squeal with rapture, as the luscious line Thrills through the marrow, and inflames the chine.
Vile dotard !
Canst thou thus consent to please !
To pander for such itching fools as these !
Fools,—whose applause must shoot beyond thy aim, And tinge thy cheek, bronzed as it is, with shame!
But wherefore have I learned, if, thus represt, The leaven still must swell within my breast ?
If the wild fig-tree, deeply rooted there, Must never burst its bounds, and shoot in air ?
Are these the fruits of study!
these of age!
O times, 0 manners !-Thou misjudging sage, Is science only useful as 'tis shown, And is thy knowledge nothing, if not known ?" But, sure, 'tis pleasant, as we walk, to see The pointed finger, hear the loud That's he, On every side :
-and seems it, in your sight, So poor a trifle, that whate'er we write
Is introduced to every school of note, And taught the youth of quality by rote ?
—Nay, more !
Our nobles, gorged, and swilled with wine, Call, o'er the banquet, for a lay divine.
Here one, on whom the princely purple glows, Snuffles some musty legend through his nose;
Slowly distils Hypsipyle's sad fate, And love-lorn Phillis, dying for her mate, With what of woeful else is said or sung;
And trips up every word, with lisping tongue.
The maudlin audience, from the couches round, Hum their assent, responsive to the sound.—
And are not now the poet's ashes blest!
Now lies the turf not lightly on his breast!
They pause a moment-and again, the room Rings with his praise :
now will not roses bloom, Now, from his relics, will not violets spring, And o'er his hallowed urn their fragrance fling!"
You laugh, ('tis answered,) and too freely here Indulge that vile propensity to sneer.
Lives there, who would not at applause rejoice, And merit, if he could, the public voice ?
Who would not leave posterity such rhymes,
As cedar oil might keep to latest times ;
Rhymes, which should fear no desperate grocer's hand, Nor fly with fish and spices through the land !
Thou, my kind monitor, whoe'er thou art, Whom I suppose to play the opponent's part, Know-when I write, if chance some happier strain (And chance it needs must be) rewards my pain, Know, I can relish praise with genuine zest;
Not mine the torpid, mine the unfeeling breast:
But that I merely toil for this acclaim, And make these eulogies my end and aim, I must not, cannot grant:
for-sift them all.
Mark well their value, and on what they fall:
Are they not showered (to pass these trifles o'er) On Labeo's Iliad, drunk with hellebore ?
On princely love-lays drivelled without thought,
And the crude trash on citron couches wrought ?
You spread the table—'tis a master-stroke, And give the shivering guest a threadbare cloak, Then, while his heart with gratitude dilates
At the glad vest and the delicious cates, Tell me, you cry,—for truth is my delight, What says the Town of me, and what I write ?
He cannot :
-he has neither ears nor eyes.
But shall I tell you, who your bribes despise ?
-Bald trifler !
cease at'once your thriftless trade;
That mountain paunch for verse was never made.
O Janus, happiest of thy happy kind!-
No waggish stork can peck at thee behind ;
No tongue thrust forth, expose to passing jeers;
No twinkling fingers, perked like ass's ears, Point to the vulgar mirth :
-but you, ye Great, To a blind occiput condemned by fate, Prevent, while yet you may, the rabble's glee, And tremble at the scoff you cannot see !—"
What says the Town "-precisely what it ought :
All you produce, sir, with such skill is wrought, That o'er the polished surface, far and wide, The critic nail without a jar must glide;
Since every verse is drawn as straight and fine
As if one eye had fixed the ruddled line.
—Whate'er the subject of his varied rhymes, The humours, passions, vices of the times ;
The pomp of nobles, barbarous pride of kings, All, all is great, and all inspired he sings !
Lo !
striplings, scarcely from the ferule freed, And smarting yet from Greek, with headlong speed Rush on heroics;
though devoid of skill To paint the rustling grove, or purling rill;
Or praise the country, robed in cheerful green, Where hogs, and hearths, and ozier frails are seen, And happy hinds, who leap o'er smouldering hay, In honour, Pales, of thy sacred day.
—Scenes of delight!—there Remus lived, and there, In grassy furrows, Quinctius tired his share ;
Quinctius, on whom his wife, with trembling haste, The dictatorial robes, exulting, placed, Before his team;
while homeward, with his plough, The lictors hurried—Good ! a Homer, thou !
There are, who hunt out antiquated lore ;
And never, but on musty authors, pore ;
These, Accius' jagged and knotty lines engage, And those, Pacuvius' hard and horny page ;
Where, in quaint tropes, Antiopa is seen Toprop her dolorific heart with teen !0, when you mark the sire, to judgment blind, Commend such models to the infant mind, Forbear to wonder whence this olio sprung, This sputtering jargon which infests our tongue ;
This scandal of the times, which shocks my ear, And which our knights bound from their seats to hear !
How monstrous seems it, that we cannot plead, When called to answer for some felon deed, Nor danger from the trembling head repel, Without a wish for—Bravo !
Vastly well !
This Pedius is a thief, the accusers cry.
You hear them, Pedius :
now, for your reply ?
In terse antitheses he weighs the crime, Equals the pause, and balances the chime;
And with such skill his flowery tropes employs, That the rapt audience scarce contain their joys.
0 charming!
charming !
he must sure prerail.
THIS, charming !
Can a Roman wag the tail ?
Were the wrecked mariner to chaunt his woe, Should I or sympathy or alms bestow ?
Sing you, when, in that tablet on your breast, I see your story to the life exprest;
A shattered bark, dashed madly on the shore, And you, scarce floating, on a broken oar ?—
No, he must feel that would my pity share, And drop a natural, not a studied tear.
But yet our numbers boast a grace unknown
To our rough sires, a smoothness all our own.
True :
the spruce metre in sweet cadence flows,
And answering sounds a tuneful chime compose :
Blue Ncreus here, the Dolphin swift divides ;
And Idè there, sees Attin climb her sides :
Nor this alone-for, in some happier line, We win the chine of the long Apennine!
Arms and the man-Here, too, perhaps, you find A pithless branch beneath a fungous rind ?
Not so ;
-a seasoned trunk of many a day, Whose gross and watery parts are drawn away.
But what, in fine, (for still you jeer me,) call
For the moist eye, bowed head, and lengthened drawl, What strains of genuine pathos?
O'er the hill
The dismal slug-horn sounded, loud and shrill, A Mimallonian blast:
fired at the sound, In maddening groups the Bacchants pour around, Mangle the haughty calf with gory hands, And scourge the indocile lynx with ivy wands ;
While Echo lengthens out the barbarous yell, And propagates the din from cell to cell !0 were not every spark of manly sense, Of pristine vigour quenched, or banished hence, Could this be borne !
this cuckoo-spit of Rome, Which gathers round the lips in froth and foam !
-The haughty calf, and Attin's jangling strain, Dropt, without effort, from the rheumy brain;
No savour they of bleeding nails afford, Or desk, oft smitten for the happy word.
But why must you, alone, displeased appear, And with harsh truths thus grate the tender ear ?
O yet beware !
think of the closing gate !
And dread the cold reception of the great:
This currish humour you extend too far, While every word growls with that hateful gnar!
Right!
From this hour, (for now my fault I see,) All shall be charming-charming all, for me :
What late seemed base, already looks divine, And wonders start to view in every line!
'Tis well, you cry :
this spot let none defile, Or turn to purposes obscene and vile.
Paint, then, two snakes entwined ;
and write around, URINE NOT, CHILDREN, HERE ;
'TIS HOLY GROUND.
Awed, I retire :
and yet-when vice appeared, Lucilius o'er the town his falchion reared ;
On Lupus, Mutius, poured his rage by name, And broke his grinders on their bleeding fame.
And yet-arch Horace, while he strove to mend, Probed all the foibles of his smiling friend ;
Played lightly round and round the peccant part, And won, unfelt, an entrance to his heart:
Well skilled the follies of the crowd to trace, And sneer, with gay good humour in his face.
And I!—I must not mutter ?
No;
nor dare-
Not to myself ?
No.
To a ditch ?
No where.
Yes, here I'll dig—here, to sure trust confide
The secret which I would, but cannot, hide.
My darling book, a word ;
—" King Midas wears (These eyes beheld them, these !) such ass's ears !
"—This quip of mine, which none must hear, or know, This fond conceit, which takes my fancy so, This nothing, if you will;
yon should not buy With all those Iliads that you prize so high.
But thou, whom Eupolis' impassioned page, Hostile to vice, inflames with kindred rage, Whom bold Cratinus, and that awful sire, Force, as thou readest, to tremble and admire;
0, view my humbler labours :
-there, if aught More highly finished, more maturely wrought, Detain thy ear, and give thy breast to glow With warmth, responsive to the inspiring flow- I seek no further :
-Far from me the rest, Yes, far the wretch, who, with a low-born jest, Can mock the blind for blindness, and pursue With vulgar ribaldry the Grecian shoe :
Bursting with self-conceit, with pride elate, Because, forsooth, in magisterial state, His worship (ædile of some paltry town)
Broke scanty weights, and put false measures down.
Far too be he-the monstrous witty fool, Who turns the numeral scale to ridicule ;
Derides the problems traced in dust or sand, And treads out all Geometry has planned-
Who roars outright to see Nonaria seize, And tug the cynic's beard-To such as these I recommend, at morn, the Prætor's bill, At eve, Calirrhoë, or—what they will.
HEALTH to my friend !
and while my vows I pay, O mark, Macrinus, this auspicious day, Which, to your sum of years already flown, Adds yet another-with a whiter stone.
Indulge your Genius, drench in wine your cares
It is not yours, with mercenary prayers
To ask of Heaven what you would die with shame, Unless you drew the gods aside, to name;
While other great ones stand, with down-cast eyes, And with a silent censer tempt the skies !
—Hard, hard the task, from the low, muttered prayer, To free the lanes ;
or find one suppliant there, Who dares to ask but what his state requires, And live to heaven and earth with known desires!
Sound sense, integrity, a conscience clear, Are begged aloud, that all at hand may hear:
But prayers like these (half whispered, half supprest)
The tongue scarce hazards from the conscious breast:
O that I could my rich old uncle see, In funeral pomp !
—O that some deity To pots of buried gold would guide my share I O that my ward.
whom I succeed as heir, Were once at rest!
poor child, he lives in pain,
And death to him must be accounted gain.-
By wedlock, thrice has Nerius swelled his store, And now—is he a widower onee more !
These blessings, with due sanctity, to crave, Once, twice, and thrice in Tiber's eddying wave He dips each morn, and bids the stream convey
The gathered evils of the night, away!
One question, friend :
-an easy one, in fine—
What are thy thoughts of Jove ?
My thoughts !
Yes;
thine.
Wouldst thou prefer him to the herd of Rome ?
To any individual ?-But, to whom ?
To Staius, for example.
Heavens !
a pause ?
Which of the two would best dispense the laws ?
Best shield the unfriended orphan ?
Good!
Now move
The suit to Staius, late preferred to Jove :
— " 0 Jove! good Jove ! " he cries, o'erwhelmed with shame, And must not Jove himself, 0 Jove!
exclaim ?
Or dost thou think the impious wish forgiven, Because, when thunder shakes the vault of heaven, The bolt innoxious flies o'er thee and thine.
To rend the forest oak and mountain pine ?
-Because, yet livid from the lightning's scath, Thy smouldering corpse (a monument of wrath)
Lies in no blasted grove, for public care
To expiate with sacrifice and prayer ;
Must, therefore, Jove, unsceptred and unfeared, Give to thy ruder mirth his foolish beard ?
What bribe hast thou to win the Powers divine, Thus, to thy nod ?
The lungs and lights of swine.
Lo !
from his little crib, the grandam hoar, Or aunt, well versed in superstitious lore, Snatches the babe ;
in lustral spittle dips
Her middle finger, and anoints his lips And forehead :
—" Charms of potency," she cries, " To break the influence of evil eyes ! "
The spell complete, she dandles high in air Her starveling Hope ;
and breathes a humble prayer, That heaven would only tender to his hands All Crassus' houses, all Licinius' lands !— "
Let every gazer by his charms be won,
And kings and queens aspire to call him son :
Contending virgins fly his smiles to meet, And roses spring where'er he sets his feet!
"Insane of soul-But I, 0 Jove, am free.
Thou knowest, I trust no nurse with prayers for me :
In mercy, then, reject each fond demand, Though, robed in white, she at thy altar stand.
This begs for nerves to pain and sickness steeled, A frame of body, that shall slowly yield To late old age :
—'Tis well, enjoy thy wish.-
But the huge platter, and high-seasoned dish, Day after day the willing gods withstand, And dash the blessing from their opening hand.
That sues for wealth :
the labouring ox is slain, And frequent victims woo the " god of gain." " 0 crown my hearth with plenty and with peace, And give my flocks and herds a large increase ! "— Madman !
how can he, when, from day to day, Steer after steer in offerings melts away ?—
Still he persists;
and still new hopes arise, With harslet and with tripe, to storm the skies. "
Now swell my harvests !
now my fields !
now, now,
It comes-it comes-auspicious to my vow ! "
While thus, poor wretch, he hangs 'twixt hope and fear, He starts, in dreadful certainty, to hear His chest reverberate the hollow groan
Of his last piece, to find itself alone !
If from my side-board I should bid you take Goblets of gold or silver, you would shake With eager rapture ;
drops of joy would start, And your left breast scarce hold your fluttering heart :
Hence, you presume the gods are bought and sold ;
And overlay their busts with captured gold.
For, 01 the brazen brotnerhood, the Power Who sends you dreams, at morning's truer hour, Most purged from phlegm, enjoys your best regards, And a gold beard his prescient skill rewards !
Now, from the temples, GOLD has chased the plain
And frugal ware of Numa's pious reign ;
The ritual pots of brass are seen no more, And Vesta's pitchers blaze in burnished ore.
O grovelling souls !
and void of things divine !
Why bring our passions to the Immortals' shrine, And judge, from what this CARNAL SENSE delights, Of what is pleasing in their purer sights ?—
THIS, the Calabriau fleece with purple soils, And mingles cassia with our native oils;
Tears from the rocky conch its pearly store, And strains the metal from the glowing ore.
This, this, indeed, is vicious ;
yet it tends
To gladden life, perhaps ;
and boasts its ends ;
But you, ye priests, (for, sure, ye can,) unfold-
In heavenly things, what boots this pomp of gold ?
No more, in truth, than dolls to Venus paid, (The toys of childhood,) by the riper maid !
No ;
let me bring the Immortals, what the race Of great Messala, now depraved and base, On their huge charger, cannot ;
—bring a mind, Where legal and where moral sense are joined With the pure essence ;
holy thoughts, that dwell
In the soul's most retired and sacred cell;
A bosom dyed in honour's noblest grain, Deep-dyed :
-with these let me approach the fane, And Heaven will hear the humble prayer I make, Though all my offering be a barley cake.
WHAT!
ever thus ?
See!
while the beams of day
In broad effulgence o'er the shutters play, Stream through the crevice, widen on the walls, On the fifth line the gnomon's shadow falls!
Yet still you sleep, like one that, stretched supine, Snores off the fumes of strong Falernian wine.
Up ! up !
mad Sirius parches every blade, And flocks and herds lie panting in the shade.
Here my youth rouses, rubs his heavy eyes, " Is it so late ?
so very late ?
" he cries ;
"
Shame, shame !
Who waits ?
Who waits there ?
quick, my Why, when !"
His bile o'erflows ;
he foams with rage, [page !
And brays so loudly, that you start in fear And fancy all Arcadia at your ear.
Behold him, with his bedgown and his books, His pens and paper, and his studious looks, Intent and earnest!
What arrests his speed, Alas !
the viscous liquid clogs the reed.
Dilute it.
Pish !
now every word I write Sinks through the paper, and eludes the sight;
Now the pen leaves no mark, the point's too fine ;
Now 'tis too blunt, and doubles every line!
O wretch !
whom every day more wretched sees-
Are these the fruits of all your studies ?
these !
Give o'er at once :
and like some callow dove, Some prince's heir, some lady's infant love, Call for chewed pap ;
and, pouting at the breast, Scream at the lullaby that woos to rest !"
But why such warmth ?
See what a pen !
nay, see! "
And is this subterfuge employed on me ?
Fond boy!
your time, with your pretext, is lost;
And all your arts are at your proper cost.
While with occasion thus you madly play, Your best of life unheeded leaks away, And scorn flows in apace :
the ill-baked ware, Rung by the potter, will its fault declare ;
ThusBut you yet are moist and yielding clay :
Call for some plastic hand without delay, Nor cease the labour, till the wheel produce A vessel nicely formed, and fit for use."
But wherefore this ?
My father, thanks to fate, Left me a fair, if not a large, estate :
—
A salt unsullied on my table shines,
And due oblations, in their little shrines, My household gods receive ;
my hearth is pure, And all my means of life confirmed and sure :
What need I more ? "
Nay, nothing ;
it is well.
Andit becomes you, too, with pride to swell, Because, the thousandth in descent, you trace Your blood, unmixed, from some high Tuscan race;
Or, when the knights march by the censor's chair, In annual pomp, can greet a kinsman there!
Away!
these trappings to the rabble show :
Me they deceive not;
for your soul I know, Within, without.
-And blush you not to see Loose Natta's life and yours so well agree ?
-But Natta's is not life :
the sleep of sin Has seized his powers, and palsied all within ;
Huge cawls of fat envelope every part, And torpor weighs on his insensate heart:
Absolved from blame by ignorance so gross, He neither sees nor comprehends his loss ;
Content in guilt's profound abyss to drop, Nor, struggling, send one bubble to the top!
Dread sire of gods !
when lust's envenomed stings
Stir the fierce natures of tyrannic kings ;
When storms of rage within their bosoms roll, And call, in thunder, for thy just control, 0, then relax the bolt, suspend the blow, And thus, and thus alone, thy vengeance show, In all her charms, set Virtue in their eye, And let them see their loss, despair, and—die !
Say, could the wretch severer tortures feel, Closed in the brazen bull ?
-Could the bright steel, That, while the board with regal pomp was spread, Gleamed o'er the guest, suspended by a thread, Worse pangs inflict than he endures, who cries, (As on the rack of conscious guilt he lies, In mental agony,) " Alas!
I fall, Down, down the unfathomed steep, without recall! "
And withers at the heart, and dares not show His bosom wife the secret of his woe !
Oft, (I remember yet,) my sight to spoil, Oft, when a boy, I bleared my eyes with oil, What time I wished my studies to decline, Nor make great Cato's dying speeches mine ;
Speeches my master to the skies had raised, Poor pedagogue !
unknowing what be praised;
And which my sire, suspense 'twixt hope and fear, With venial pride, had brought his friends to hear.
For then, alas!
'twas my supreme delight To study chances, and compute aright, What sum the lucky sice would yield in play, And what the fatal aces sweep away :
Anxious no rival candidate for fame
Should hit the long-necked jar with nicer aim ;
Nor, while the whirling top beguiled the eye, With happier skill the sounding scourge apply.
But you have passed the schools ;
have studied long, And learned the eternal bounds of Right and Wrong, And what the Porch, (by Mycon limned, of yore, With trowsered Medes,) unfolds of ethic lore, Where the shorn youth, on herbs and pottage fed, Bend, o'er the midnight page, the sleepless head :
And, sure, the letter where, divergent wide, The Samian branches shoot on either side, Has to your view, with no obscure display, Marked, on the right, the strait but better way.
And yet you slumber still!
and still opprest
With last night's revels, knock your head and breast!
And stretching o'er your drowsy couch, produce Yawn after yawn, as if your jaws were loose!
Is there no certain mark at which to aim ?—
Still must your bow be bent at casual game ?
With clods, and potsherds, must you still pursue Each wandering crow that chance presents to view;
And, careless of your life's contracted span, Live from the moment, and without a plan?
When bloated dropsies every limb invade, In vain to hellebore you fly for aid :
Meet with preventive skill the young disease, And Craterus will boast no golden fees.
Mount, hapless youths, on Contemplation's wings, And mark the Causes and the End of things :
—
Learn what we are, and for what purpose born, What station here 'tis given us to adorn ;
How best to blend security with ease, And win our way through life's tempestuous seas ;
What bounds the love of property requires, And what to wish, with unreproved desires:
How far the genuine use of wealth extends ;
And the just claims of country, kindred, friends ;
What Heaven would have us be, and where our stand, In this GREAT WHOLE, is fixed by high command.
Learn these-and envy not the sordid gains
Which recompense the well-tongued lawyer's pains :
Though Umbrian rustic-,;
, for his sage advice, Pour in their jars of fish, and oil, and spice, So thick and fast, that, ere the first be o'er, A second, and a third, are at the door.
But here, some brother of the blade, some coarse
And shag-haired captain, bellows loud and hoarse;
"
Away with this cramp, philosophic stuff!
My learning serves my turn, and that's enough.
I laugh at all your dismal Solons, I;
Who stalk with downcast looks, and heads awry, Muttering within themselves, where'er they roam, And churning their mad silence till it foam !
Who mope o'er sick men's dreams, howe'er absurd, And on protruded lips poise every word ;
Nothing can come from nothing.
Apt and plain!
Nothing return to nothing.
Good, again !
And this it is for which they peak and pine, This precious stuff, for which they never dine !
"Jove, how he laughs !
the brawny youths around Catch the contagion, and return the sound ;
Convulsive mirth on every cheek appears, And every nose is wrinkled into sneers !"
Doctor, a patient said, employ your art, I feel a strange wild fluttering at the heart;
.
My breast seems tightened, and a fetid smell Affects my breath,—feel here ;
all is not well.
"
Medicine and rest the fever's rage compose, And the third day his blood more calmly flows.
The fourth, unable to contain, he sends A hasty message to his wealthier friends, And just about to bathe—requests, in fine, A moderate flask of old Surrentin wine."
Good heavens!
my friend, what sallow looks are here ? "
Pshaw, nonsense!
nothing! “
Yet 'tis worth your fear, Whate'er it be :
the waters rise within, And, though unfelt, distend your sickly skin."
Andyours still more !
Whence springs this freedom, tro' ?
Are you, forsooth, my guardian ?
Long ago I buried him ;
and thought my nonage o'er :
But You remain to school me ! "
Sir, no more.
"
-Now to the bath, full gorged with luscious fare, See the pale wretch his bloated carcass bear ;
While from his lungs, that faintly play by fits, His gasping throat sulphureous steam emits !—
Cold shiverings seize him, as for wine lie calls, His grasp betrays him, and the goblet falls !
From his loose teeth the lip, convulsed, withdraws, And the rich cates drop through his listless jaws.
Then trumpets, torches come, in solemn state ;
And my fine youth, so confident of late, Stretched on a splendid bier, and essenced o'er, Lies, a stiff corpse, heels foremost at the door.
Romans of yesterday, with covered head, Shoulder him to the pyre, andall is said!"
But why to me ?
Examine every part;
My pulse :
-and lay your finger on my heart;
You'll find no fever :
touch my hands and feet, A natural warmth, and nothing more, you'll meet."
'Tis well!
But if you light on gold by chance, If a fair neighbour cast a sidelong glance, Still will that pulse with equal calmness flow, And still that heart no fiercer throbbings know ?
Try yet again.
In a brown dish behold, Coarse gritty bread, and coleworts stale and old :
Now, prove your taste.
Why those averted eyes ?
Hah !
I perceive :
-a secret ulcer lies Within that pampered mouth, too sore to bear
The untender grating of plebeian fare!
Where dwells this natural warmth, when danger's near, And " each particular hair " starts up with fear ?
Or where resides it, when vindictive ire Inflames the bosom ;
when the veins run fire, The reddening eye-balls glare ;
and all you say, And all you do, a mind so warped betray, .
That mad Orestes, if the freaks he saw, Would give you up at once to chains and straw!
WHAT !
you, ray Alcibiades, aspire To sway the state!
—(Suppose that bearded sire, Whom hemlock from a guilty world removed, Thus to address the stripling that he loved.)
On what apt talents for a charge so high, Ward of great Pericles, do you rely ?
Forecast on others by grey hairs conferred, Haply, with you, anticipates the beard !
And prompts you, prescient of the public weal, Now to disclose your thoughts, and now conceal!
Hence, when the rabble form some daring plan, And factious murmurs spread from man to man, Mute and attentive you can bid them stand, By the majestic wafture of your hand!
Lo !
all is hushed :
what now, what will he speak,
What floods of sense from his charged bosom break !
" Romans !
I think—I fear—I think, I say, This is not well :
-perhaps, the better way."
—O power of eloquence !
But you, forsooth, In the nice, trembling scale can poise the truth, With even hand ;
can with intentive view, Amidst deflecting curves, the right pursue ;
Or, where the rule deceives the vulgar eye With its warped foot, the unerring line apply :
And, while your sentence strikes with doom precise, Stamp the black Theta on the front of vice!
Rash youth !
relying on a specious skin,
While all is dark deformity within, Check the fond thought;
nor, like the peacock proud, Spread your gay plumage to the applauding crowd, Before your hour arrive Ah, rather drain
Whole isles of hellebore, to cool your brain !
For, what is YOUR chief good ? "
To heap my board
With every dainty earth and sea afford ;
To bathe, and bask me in the sunny ray, And doze the careless hours of life away.
"
—Hold, hold !
yon tattered beldame, hobbling by, If haply asked, would make the same reply. "
But I am nobly born."
Agreed. " And fair."
'Tis granted too :
yet goody Baucis there, Who, to the looser slaves, her pot-herbs cries, Is just as philosophic, just as wise.
-How few, alas !
their proper faults explore!
While, on his loaded back, who walks before, Each eye is fixed.
—You touch a stranger's arm, And ask him if he knows Vectidius' farm ? " Whose," he replies ?
That rich old chuff's, whose ground Would tire a hawk to wheel it fairly round."
0, ho !
that wretch, on whose devoted head III stars and angry gods their rage have shed!
Who on high festivals, when all is glee, And the loose yoke hangs on the cross-way tree, As, from the jar, he scrapes the incrusted clay, Groans o'er the revels of so dear a day ;
Champs on a coated onion dipt in brine ;
And while his hungry hinds exulting dine
On barley broth, sucks up, with thrifty care, The mothery dregs of his palled vinegar!
"But, if “ YOU bask you in the sunny ray, And doze the careless hours of youth away," There are, who at such gross delights will spurn, And spit their venom on your life in turn;
Expose, with eager hate, your low desires, Your secret passions, and unhallowed fires.— " Why, while the beard is nurst with every art, Those anxious pains to bare the shameful part ?
In vain :
-should five athletic knaves essay To pluck, with ceaseless care, the weeds away, Still the rank fern, congenial to the soil, Would spread luxuriant, and defeat their toil!
"Misled by rage, our bodies we expose, And while we give, forget to ward, the blows ;
This, this is life !
and thus our faults are shown, By mutual spleen :
we know-and we are known !
But your defects elude inquiring eyes !—
Beneath the groin the ulcerous evil lies, Impervious to the view ;
and o'er the wound
The broad effulgence of the zone is bound !
But can you, thus, the inward pang restrain,
Thus cheat the sense of languor and of pain ?"
But if the people call me wise and just, Sure I may take the general voice on trust!
"—No :
-If you tremble at the sight of gold ;
Indulge lust's wildest sallies uncontrolled ;
Or, bent on outrage, at the midnight hour, Girt with a ruffian band, the Forum scour ;
Then, wretch ! in vain the voice of praise you hear.
And drink the vulgar shout with greedy ear.
Hence, with your spurious claims!
Rejudge your cause, And fling the rabble back their vile applause :
To your own breast, in quest of worth, repair, And blush to find how poor a stock is there !
PERSIUS.
POETS are wont a hundred mouths to ask, A hundred tongues,—whate'er the purposed task;
Whether a tragic tale of Pelops' line
For the sad actor, with deep mouth, to whine ;
Or Epic lay;
—the Parthian winged with fear, And wrenching from his groin the Roman spear. [wrong,)CORNUTUS.
Heavens!
to what purpose, (sure, I heard thee Tend those huge gobbets of robustious song, Which, struggling into day, distend thy lungs, And need a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues ?
Let fustian bards to Helicon repair, And suck the spongy fogs that hover there, Bards, in whose fervid brains, while sense recoils, The pot of Progne, or Thyestes boils, Dull Glyco's feast !-But what canst thou propose ?
Puffed by thy heaving lungs no metal glows;
Nor dost thou, mumbling o'er some close-spent strain, Croak the grave nothings of an idle brain ;
Nor swell, until thy cheeks, with thundering sound, Displode, and spurt their airy froth around.
Confined to common life, thy numbers flow, And neither soar too high, nor sink too low ;
There strength and ease in graceful union meet, Though polished, subtle, and though poignant, sweet;
Yet powerful to abash the front of crime, And crimson error's cheek with sportive rhyme.
0 still be this thy study, this thy care :
Leave to Mycenæ's prince his horrid fare, His head and feet;
and seek, with Roman taste, For Roman food-a plain but pure repast.
PERSIUS.
Mistake me not.
Far other thoughts engage
My mind, Cornutus, than to swell my page With air-blown trifles, impotent and vain, And grace, with noisy pomp, an empty strain.
Oh, no :
the world shut out, 'tis my design, To open (prompted by the inspiring Nine)
The close recesses of my breast, and bare
To your keen eye each thought, each feeling, there ;
Yes, best of friends !
'tis now my wish to prove
How much you fill my heart, engross my love.
Ring then-for, to your practised ear, the sound Will show the solid, and where guile is found Beneath the varnished tongue :
for THIS, in fine, I dared to wish an hundred voices mine ;
Proud to declare, in language void of art, How deep your form is rooted in my heart, And paint, in words,—ah, could they paint the whole,- The ineffable sensations of my soul.
When first I laid the purple by, and free, Yet trembling at my new-felt liberty, Approached the hearth, and on the Lares hung The bulla, from my willing neck unstrung;
When gay associates, sporting at my side, And the white boss, displayed with conscious pride, Gave me, unchecked, the haunts of vice to trace, And throw my wandering eyes on every face, When life's perplexing maze before me lay, And error, heedless of the better way, To straggling paths, far from the route of truth, Woo'd, with blind confidence, my timorous youth, I fled to you, Cornutus, pleased to rest My hopes and fears on your Socratic breast, Nor did you, gentle Sage, the charge decline :
Then, dextrous to beguile, your steady line Reclaimed, I know not by what winning force, My morals, warped from virtue's straighter course;
While reason pressed incumbent on my soul, That struggled to receive the strong control, And took like wax, tempered by plastic skill, The form your hand imposed ;
and bears it still!
Can I forget how many a summer's day, Spent in your converse, stole, unmarked, away ?
Or how, while listening with increased delight, I snatched from feasts the earlier hours of night ?
-One time, (for to your bosom still I grew,) One time of study, and of rest, we knew;
One frugal board where, every care resigned, An hour of blameless mirth relaxed the mind.
And sure our lives, which thus accordant move, (Indulge me here, Cornutus,) clearly prove
That both are subject to the self-same law, And from one horoscope their fortunes draw ;
And whether Destiny's unerring doom
In equal Libra poised our days to come ;
Or friendship's holy hour our fates combined, And to the Twins a sacred charge assigned ;
Or Jove, benignant, broke the gloomy spell By angry Saturn wove ;
—I know not well-
But sure some star there is, whose bland control Subdues, to yours, the temper of my soul!
Countless the various species of mankind, Countless the shades which separate mind from mind;
No general object of desire is known ;
Each has his will, and each pursues his own ;
With Latian wares, one roams the Eastern main, To purchase spice, and cummin's blanching grain ;
Another, gorged with dainties, swilled with wine, Fattens in sloth, and snores out life, supine;
This loves the Campus that, destructive play ;
And those, in wanton dalliance melt away :
—
But when the knotty gout their strength has broke, And their dry joints crack like some withered oak, Then they look back, confounded and aghast, On the gross days in fogs and vapours past;
With late regret the waste of life deplore, No purpose gained, and time, alas!
no more.
But you, my friend, whom nobler views delight, To pallid vigils give the studious night;
Cleanse youthful breasts from every noxious weed, And sow the tilth with Cleanthean seed.
There seek, ye young, ye old, secure to find
That certain end which stays the wavering mind ;
Stores, which endure, when other means decay, Through life's last stage, a sad and cheerless way.“
Right ;
and to-morrow this shall be our care."
Alas !
to-morrow, like to-day, will fare. "
What !
is one day, forsooth, so great a boon ? "
But when it comes, (and come it will too soon,) Reflect, that yesterday's to-morrow's o'er.—
Thus " one to-morrow !
one to-morrow ! more,"
Have seen long years before them fade away ;
And still appear no nearer than to-day !
So while the wheels on different axles roll, In vain (though governed by the self-same pole)
The hindmost to o'ertake the foremost tries ;
Fast as the one pursues the other flies !
FREEDOM, in truth, it steads us much to have :
Not that by which each manumitted slave, Each Publius, with his tally, may obtain A casual dole of coarse and damaged grain.
—O souls!
involved in Error's thickest shade, Who think a Roman with one turn is made!
Look on this paltry groom, this Dama here, Who at three farthings would be prized too dear;
This blear-eyed scoundrel, who your husks would steal, And outface truth to hide the starving meal;
Yet-let his master twirl this knave about, And MARCUS DAMA in a trice steps out!
Amazing!
MARCUS surety ?-yet distrust!
MARCUS your judge ?-yet fear a doom unjust!
MARCUS avouch it ?-then the fact is clear.
The writings !—set your hand, good MARCUS, here.
"This is mere liberty,-a name, alone :
Yet this is all the cap can make our own."
Sure, there's no other.
All mankind agree
That those who live without control are free :
I live without control;
and therefore hold Myself more free than Brutus was of old.
Absurdly put;
a Stoic cries, whose ear, Rinsed with sharp vinegar, is quick to hear :
True ;
-all who live without control are free ;
But that YOU live so, I can ne'er agree."
No ?
From the Prætor's wand when I withdrew, Lord of myself, why, might I not pursue
My pleasure unrestrained, respect still had To what the rubric of the law forbad ?
"Listen,-but first your brows from anger clear, And bid your nose dismiss that rising sneer;
Listen, while I the genuine truth impart, And root those old wives' fables from your heart.
160It was not, is not in the " Prætor's wand," To gift a fool with power, to understand
The nicer shades of duty, and educe, From short and rapid life, its end and use :
The labouring hind shall sooner seize the quill, And strike the lyre with all a master's skill.
Reason condemns the thought, with mien severe,
And drops this maxim in the secret ear, " Forbear to venture, with preposterous toil, On what, in venturing, you are sure to spoil."
In this plain sense of what is just and right
The laws of nature and of man unite;
That Inexperience should some caution show, And spare to reach at what she does not know.
Prescribe you hellebore !
without the skill
To weigh the ingredients, or compound the pill ?— Physic, alarmed, the rash attempt withstands, And wrests the dangerous mixture from your hands.
Should the rude clown, skilled in no star to guide
His dubious course, rush on the trackless tide, 180 Would not Palemon at the fact exclaim, And swear the world had lost all sense of shame !
Say, is it yours, by wisdom's steady rays, To walk secure through life's entangled maze ?
Yours to discern the specious from the true, And where the gilt conceals the brass from view ?
Speak, can you mark, with some appropriate sign,
What to pursue, and what, in turn, decline ?
Does moderation all your wishes guide, And temperance at your cheerful board preside?
Do friends your love experience ?
are your stores
Now dealt with closed and now with open doors,
As fit occasion calls ?
Can you restrain
The eager appetite of sordid gain ;
Nor feel, when in the mire a doit you note, Mercurial spittle gurgle in your throat ?
If you cau say, and truly, " THESE ARE MINE, And THIS I CAN :
"—suffice it.
I decline All further question ;
you are wise and free, No less by Jove's than by the law's decree.
But if, good Marcus, you, who formed so late One of our batch, of our enslaved estate, Beneath a specious outside, still retain
The foul contagion of your ancient strain;
If the sly fox still burrow in some part, Some secret corner, of your tainted heart;
I straight retract the freedom which I gave, And hold your Dama still, and still a slave !
Reason concedes you nothing.
Let us try.
Thrust forth your finger.
"See." 0, heavens, awry!
Yet what so trifling ?
-But, though altars smoke, Though clouds of incense every god invoke, In vain you sue, one drachm of RIGHT to find, One scruple, lurking in the foolish mind.
Nature abhors the mixture :
the rude clown
As well may lay his spade and mattock down, And with light foot and agile limbs prepare To dance three steps with soft Bathyllus' air!"
Still I am free."
You!
subject to the sway
Of countless masters, FREE!
What datum, pray, Supports your claim ?
Is there no other yoke
Than that which, from your neck, the Prætor broke !­ "
Go, bear these scrapers to the bath with speed ;
What !
loitering, knave ?
"—Here's servitude indeed !
Yet you unmoved the angry sounds would hear ;
You owe no duty, and can know no fear.
But if within you feel the strong control-
If stormy passions lord it o'er your soul, Are you more free than he whom threatenings urge To bear the strigils, and escape the scourge ?
'Tis morn ;
yet sunk in sloth you snoring lie.
“ Up ! up ! " cries Avarice, " and to business hie ;
Nay, stir."
I will not.
Still she presses, " Rise ! " I cannot. " But you must and shall," she cries.
And to what purpose ? "
This a question !
Go,
Bear fish to Pontus, and bring wines from Co ;
Bring ebon, flax, whate'er the East supplies, Musk for perfumes, and gums for sacrifice :
Prevent the mart, and the first pepper take From the tired camel ere his thirst he slake.
Traffic forswear, if interest intervene "— But Jove will over-hear me.—“ Hold, my spleen !
O dolt!
but, mark-that thumb will bore and bore
The empty salt (scraped to the quick before)
For one poor grain, a vapid meal to mend, If you aspire to thrive with Jove your friend!
"You rouse, (for who can truths like these withstand ?)
Victual your slaves, and urge them to the strand.
Prepared in haste to follow;
and, ere now, Had to the Ægean turned your vent'rous prow, But that sly Luxury the process eyed, Waylaid your desperate steps, and, taunting, cried," Ho, madman !
whither, in this hasty plight ?
What passion drives you forth ?
what furies fright ?
Whole urns of hellebore might hope in vain To cool this high-wrought fever of the brain.
What !
quit your peaceful couch, renounce your ease, To rush on hardships, and to dare the seas!
And while a broken plank supports your meat, And a coiled cable proves your softest seat, Suck from squab jugs that pitchy scents exhale, The seaman's beverage, sour at once and stale !
And all for what ?
that sums, which now are lent
At modest five, may sweat out twelve per cent.!—" 0 rather cultivate the joys of sense, And crop the sweets which youth and health dispense ;
Give the light hours to banquets, love, and wine :
THESE are the zest of life, and these are mine !
Dust and a shade are all you soon must be :
Live, then, while yet you may.
Time presses.
—See!
Even while I speak, the present is become
The past, and lessens still life's little sum.
"Now, sir, decide;
shall this, or that, command ?
Alas !
the bait, displayed on either hand, Distracts your choice :
-but, ponder as you may, Of this be sure ;
both, with alternate sway, Will lord it o'er you, while, with slavish fears, From side to side your doubtful duty veers.
Nor must you, though in some auspicious hour You spurn their mandate, and resist their power, At once conclude their future influence vain :
—
With struggling hard the dog may snap his chain ;
Yet little freedom from the effort find, If, as he flies, he trails its length behind. "
Yes, I am fixed ;
to Love a long adieu !—
Nay, smile not, Davus ;
you will find it true."
So, while his nails, gnawn to the quick, yet bled, The sage Chærestratus, deep-musing, said.­ " Shall I my virtuous ancestry defame, Consume my fortune, and disgrace my name, While, at a harlot's wanton threshold laid, Darkling, I whine my drunken serenade!
"'Tis nobly spoken :
-Let a lamb be brought To the Twin Powers that this deliverance wrought. "
But-if I quit her, will she not complain ?
Will she not grieve ?
Good Davus, think again.
"Fond trifler !
you will find her " grief" too late ;
When the red slipper rattles round your pate, Vindictive of the mad attempt to foil Her potent spell, and all-involving toil.
Dismissed, you storm and bluster :
hark !
she calls,
And, at the word, your boasted manhood falls.
" Mark, Davus ;
of her own accord, she sues!
Mark, she invites me!
Can I now refuse ?
Yes, Now, and EVER.
If you left her door Whole and entire, you must return no more.
"Right.
This is He, the man whom I demand;
This, Davus;
not the creature of a wand Waved by some foolish lictor.
—And is he, This master of himself, this truly free, Who marks the dazzling lure Ambition spreads, And headlong follows where the meteor leads ? "
Watch the nice hour, and on the scrambling tribes Pour, without stint, your mercenary bribes, Vetches and pulse ;
that, many a year gone by, Greybeards, as basking in the sun they lie, May boast how much your Floral Games surpast, In cost and splendour, those they witnessed last! "
A glorious motive !
And on Herod's day, When every room is decked in meet array, And lamps along the greasy windows spread, Profuse of flowers, gross, oily vapours shed ;
When the vast tunny's tail in pickle swims, And the crude must foams o'er the pitcher's brims ;
You mutter secret prayers, by fear devised, And dread the sabbaths of the circumcised !
Then a cracked egg-shell fills you with affright, And ghosts and goblins haunt your sleepless night.
Last, the blind priestess, with her sistrum shrill, And Galli, huge and high, a dread instil Of gods, prepared to vex the human frame With dropsies, palsies, ills of every name, Unless the trembling victim champ, in bed, Thrice every morn, on a charmed garlic-head.
Preach to the martial throng these lofty strains, And lo!
some chief more famed for bulk than brains,
Some vast Vulfenius, blessed with lungs of brass, Laughs loud and long at the scholastic ass ;
And, for a clipt cent-piece, sets, by the tale, A hundred Greek philosophers to sale!
SAY, have the wintry storms, which round us beat, Chased thee, my Bassus, to thy Sabine seat ?
Does music there thy sacred leisure fill, While the strings quicken to thy manly quill ?—
O skilled, in matchless numbers, to disclose How first from Night this fair creation rose ;
And kindling, as the lofty themes inspire, To smite, with daring hand, the Latian lyre!
Anon, with youth and youth's delights to toy, And give the dancing chords to love and joy ;
Or wake, with moral touch, to accents sage, And hymn the heroes of a nobler age!
To me, while tempests howl and billows rise, Liguria's coast a warm retreat supplies,Where the huge cliffs an ample front display, And, deep within, recedes the sheltering bay.
The Port of Luna, friends, is worth your note—
So, in his sober moments, Ennius wrote, When, all his dreams of transmigration past, He found himself plain Quintus at the last!
Here to repose I give the cheerful day, Careless of what the vulgar think or say ;
Or what the South, from Afric's burning air, Unfriendly to the fold, may haply bear :
And careless still, though richer herbage crown My neighbours' fields, or heavier crops embrown.
— Nor, Bassus, though capricious Fortune grace
Thus with her smiles a low-bred, low-born race, Will e'er thy friend, for that, let Envy plough One careful furrow on his open brow ;
Give crooked age upon his youth to steal, Defraud his table of one generous meal;
Or, stooping o'er the dregs of mothery wine, Touch, with suspicious nose, the sacred sign.
But inclinations vary :
-and the Power That beams, ascendant, on the natal hour, Even Twins produces of discordant souls, And tempers, wide asunder as the poles.
The one on birth-days, and on those alone, Prepares (but with a forecast all his own)
On tunny-pickle, from the shops, to dine, And dips his withered pot-herbs in the brine;
Trembles the pepper from his hands to trust, And sprinkles, grain by grain, the sacred dust.
The other, large of soul, exhausts his hoard, While yet a stripling, at the festive hoard.
To USE my fortune, Bassus, I intend :
Nor, therefore, deem me so profuse, my friend, So prodigally vain, as to afford
The costly turbot for my freedmen's board ;
Or so expert in flavours, as to show How, by the relish, thrush from thrush T know."
Live to your means ”—’tis wisdom's voice you hear-
And freely grind the produce of the year :
What scruples check you?
Ply the hoe and spade, And lo!
another crop is in the blade.
True ;
but the claims of duty caution crave.
A friend, scarce rescued from the Ionian wave, Grasps a projecting rock, while in the deep
His treasures, with his prayers, unheeded sleep :
I see him stretched, desponding, on the ground, His tutelary gods all wrecked around, His bark dispersed in fragments o'er the tide, And sea-mews sporting on the ruins wide.
Sell, then, a pittance ('tis my prompt advice)
Of this your land, and send your friend the price ;
Lest, with a pictured storm, forlorn and poor, He ask cheap charity from door to door.“
But then, my angry heir, displeased to find
His prospects lessened by an act so kind, May slight my obsequies ;
and, in return, Give my cold ashes to a scentless urn ;
Reckless what vapid drugs he flings thereon, Adulterate cassia, or dead cinnamon !—
Can I (bethink in time) my means impair, And with impunity provoke my heir ?
-Here Bestius rails—“ A plague on Greece," he cries, " And all her pedants !-there the evil lies ;
For since their mawkish, their enervate lore, With dates and pepper, cursed our luckless shore, Luxury has tainted all;
and ploughmen spoil Their wholesome barley-broth with luscious oil.
"Heavens !
can you stretch (to fears like these a slave)
Your fond solicitude beyond the grave ?
Away !-But thou, my heir, whoe'er thou art, Step from the crowd, and let us talk apart.
Hearest thou the news ?
Cæsar has won the day, (So, from the camp, his laurelled missives say,) And Germany is ours !
The city wakes,
And from her altars the cold ashes shakes.- Lo !
from the imperial spoils, Cæsonia brings Arms, and the martial robes of conquered kings, To deck the temples ;
while, on either hand, Chariots of war and bulky captives stand In long array.
I, too, my joy to prove, Will to the emperor's Genius, and to Jove, Devote, in gratitude for deeds so rare, Two hundred well-matched fencers, pair by pair.
Who blames-who ventures to forbid me?
You ?
Woe to your future prospects !
if you do.
-And, sir, not this alone;
for I have vowed A supplemental largess to the crowd, Of corn and oil.
What!
muttering still ?
draw near,
And speak aloud, for once, that I may hear. "
My means are not so low that I should care
For that poor pittance you may leave your heir.
"Just as you please :
but were I, sir, bereft
Of all my kin ;
no aunt, no uncle left;
No nephew, niece ;
were all my cousins gone, And all my cousins' cousins, every one, Aricia soon some Manius would supply, Well pleased to take that “pittance," when I die."
Manius !
a beggar of the first degree, A son of earth, your heir ! "
Nay, question me, Ask who my grandsire's sire ?
I know not well, And yet, on recollection, I might tell;
But urge me one step further—I am mute :
A son of earth, like Manius, past dispute.
Thus his descent and mine are equal proved, Aud we at last are cousins, though removed.
But why should you, who still before me run, Require my torch ere yet the race be won ?
Think me your Mercury :
Lo !
here I stand,
As painters represent him, purse in hand':
Will you, or not, the proffered boon receive, And take, with thankfulness, whate'er I leave ?
Something, you murmur, of the heap is spent.
True :
as occasion called it freely went;
In life 'twas mine :
but death your chance secures, And what remains, or more or less, is yours.
Of Tadius' legacy no questions raise, Nor turn upon me with a grandsire-phrase, " Live on the interest of your fortune, boy ;
To touch the principal is to destroy.""
What, after all, may I expect to have ? "
Expect!
—Pour oil upon my viands, slave, Pour with unsparing hand!
shall my best cheer
On high and solemn days be the singed ear Of some tough, smoke-dried hog, with nettles drest;
That your descendant, while in earth I rest, May gorge on dainties, and, when lust excites, Give to patrician beds his wasteful nights ?
Shall I, a napless figure, pale and thin, Glide by, transparent, in a parchment skin, That he may strut with more than priestly pride, And swag his portly paunch from side to side ?
Go, truck your soul for gain !
buy, sell, exchange ;
From pole to pole in quest of profit range.
Let none more shrewdly play the factor's part;
None bring his slaves more timely to the mart ;
Puff them with happier skill, as caged they stand, Or clap their well-fed sides with nicer hand.
Double your fortune-treble it-yet more­ 'Tis four, six, ten-fold what it was before :
O bound the heap—You, who could yours confine, Tell me, Chrysippus, how to limit mine!
JOHN CHILDS AND SON, BUNGAY.
