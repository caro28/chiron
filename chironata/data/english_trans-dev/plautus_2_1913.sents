AMPHITRYON, the Tbeban GeneraLSOSIA, the servant of Amphitryon.
BLEPHARO, the Pilot of Amphitryon's Shar.AN ACTOR.ALCMENA, wife of Amphitryon.
Scene.
—Thebes before the house of AMPHITRYOL.CREON, King of Thebes, being at war with the Teleboans or Tapbians, under the command of Ptereias, sends an army against them.
This is commanded by Amphitryon, who leaves his wife Alcmena pregnant at his departure from '"hebes.
During his absence from home, Jupiter, assuming his form, and blercury that of his servant Sosia, present themselves to Alcmena, as though just returned from the expedition against the Taphians.
By means of this stra­ tagem, Jupiter is admitted to the embraces of Alcmena.
While Mercury is keeping watch at the door of Amphitryon's house, Sosia, who has just arrived at Thebes with Amphitryon, makes his appearance for the purpose of announcing to Alcmena his master's return.
Mercury, pretending that he himself is the real Sosia, and that the other is an impostor, drives him away from the door.
He goes back to his master, who returns with him to the house, and on meeting Alcmena, she denies his assertion that he has but that moment returned from the expedition, and now presents himself to her for the first time since his return.
On this, Amphitryon charges her with infidelity, and goes away to the harbour to find a witness who may persuade Alcmena of the truth of his assertions.
When he returns, he is first driven away from the house by Mercury, and is after­ wards accused by Jupiter of attempting to personate Amphitryon, which person Jupiter asserts himself to be.
The dispute is referred to Blepharo, the pilot of Amphitryon, who.
after making minute enquiries into the matter, professes himself utterly unaole to aecide between them.
In the Fifth Act, at the moment in which Alcmena is delivered of Hercules and Iphiclus, a violent peal of thunder is heard, and Amphitryon swoons with the shock.
Bromia, the attendant of Alcmena, comes out of the house, and having raised Amphitryon from the ground, on his recovery informs him of the delivery of Alcmena.
At this juncture, Jupiter descends in his own character, and reveals the mystery to Amphitryon, who then becomes reconciled with his wite.
'UPITER, being captivated by love (Amore) for Alcmena, has changed (Mutavit) himself into the form of her husband, while Amphitryon is fighting for (Pro) his country with the foe;
in the form (Habitu) of Sosia, Mercury acts as his servant.
He (Is) imposes upon the master and the servant, on their arrival.
Amphitryon commences a quarrel (Turbas) with his wife;
and Jupiter and Amphitryon seize (Raptant) one another as adulterers.
Blepharo, chosen as umpire, is not able to determine which of the two (Uter1) is Amphitryon.
At last they understand all (Omnem) the matter;
and she brings forth twins.
As, in purchasing and selling your merchandize2, you are desirous to render me propitious to your bargains, and that I should assist you in all things;
and as both in foreign coun­ tries and at home, you desire me to turn to the best advantage the business and the accounts of you all, and that with fair and ample profit, without end, I should crown the ventures both which you have begun, and which you shall begin;
ana, as you wish me to delight you and all yours with joyous news3-these tidings will I bring, that I may announce their.
to you, things which in especial are for your common interest (for already do you know, indeed, that it has been given and as­ signed to me by the other Divinities, to preside over news and profit) :
as you would wish me to favour and promote these things, that lasting gain may ever be forthcoming for you, so shall you give silence for this play, and so shall you be fair and upright judges here, all of you.
Now, by whose command, and for what reason 1 am come, I'll tell you, and at the same time, myself, I will disclose my name.
By the command of Jupiter I am come;
my name is Mercuryl.
My father has sent me hither to you to entreat, although, what should as his commands be enjoined on you, he knew that you would do, inasmuch as he knew full well that you venerate and fear himself, as is befitting Jupiter.
But, certainly, he bade me ask this of you with entreaty, in gentle tones, and in bland accents.
For, in fact, this Jupiter, by whose command I am come, dreads a mishap2 not less than any one of you.
Born of a mortal mother, a mortal sire, it is not reasonable to be surprised if he has apprehensions for himself.
And I too, as well, who am the son of Jupiter, through my relationship to my father, stand in dread of ill.
Therefore, in peace am I come to you, and peace do I bring.
I wish a thing to be asked of you that's reasonable and feasible;
for, reasonable things to ask of the reasonable, a reasonable mediator have I been sent.
For from the reasonable it is not right to ask things unrea­ sonable ;
whereas from the unreasonable to ask things reason­ able, is sheer folly, since these unrighteous persons are ignorant of what is right, and observe it not.
Now then, all lend your attention here to the things which I shall say.
What we wish, you ought to wish as well:
both I and my father have well deserved of you and of your state.
But why should I men­ tion how in Tragedies I have seen others, such as Neptune, Valour, Victory, Mars, Bellona, making mention of the good services which they had done you ?
Of all these benefits, the ruler of the Deities, my sire, was the founder.
But this has never been the habit of my father, to throw in your teeth what good he has done unto the good.
He thinks that this is gratefully returned by you to him, and that he bestows these blessings on you deservedly, which he does bestow.
Now, the matter which I came here to ask, I'll first premise, after that I'll tell the subject of this Tragedy.
Why have you con­ tracted your brows ?
Is it because I said that this would be a Tragedy ?
I am a God, and I'll change it.
This same, if you wish it, from a Tragedy I'll make to be a Comedy, with all the lines the same.
Whether would ye it were so, or not ?
But I'm too foolish ;
as though I didn't know, who am a God, that you so wish it;
upon this subject I understand what your feelings are.
I'll make this to be a mixture-a Tragi-comedy1.
For me to make it entirely to be a Comedy, where Kings and Gods appear, I do not deem right.
What then ?
Since here the servant has a part as well, just as I said, I'll make it to be a Tragi-comedy.
Now Jupiter has ordered me to beg this of you, that the inspectors2 should go among each of the seats throughout the whole theatre3, amid the spectators, that, if they should see any suborned applauders of any actor, there should in the theatre be taken away from them the pledge of their coats, as a security for their good behaviour.
But if any should solicit the palm of victory for the actors, or if for any artist, whether by written letters, or whether any person him­ self should solicit personally, or whether by messenger ;
or i the Ædiles, too, should unfairly adjudge to any one the re­ ward;
Jupiter has commanded the law to be the same as if he had sought by solicitation an appointment for himself or for another.
By valour has he declared that you exist as victors, not by canvassing or unfair dealing.
Why any the less should there be the same principle for the player, which there is for the greatest man ?
By merit, not by favourers, ought we to seek our ends.
He who does aright has ever favourers enough, if there is honesty in them in whose disposal this matter!
rests.
This, too, he directed me likewise in his injunctions, that there should be inspectors over the players;
that, he who should have procured suborned persons to applaud himself, or ne who should have contrived for another give less satis­ faction, from the same they might strip off his dress and leather2 mask.
I don't wish you to be surprised, for what reason Jupiter now concerns himself about actors.
Don't be surprised, Jupiter himself is about to take part in this play.
Why are you wondering at this ?
As though, indeed, a new thing were now mentioned, that Jupiter takes to the calling of a player.
But a year since3, when here on the stage the actors invoked Jupiter, he came;
he aided them.
Besides, surely in Tragedy he has a place.
This play, I say, Jupiter himself will take a part in this day, and I together with him.
Now do you give attention while 1 shall relate to you the subject of this Comedy.
This city is Thebes;
in that house there (pointing), Am­ phitry on4 dwells, born at Argos, of an Argive sire;
whose wife is Alcmena, daughter of Electryon.
This Amphitryon is now the general of the Theban troops;
for between the Tele­ boans and the Theban people there is war.
He, before he de­ parted hence for the expedition, left his wife Alcmena pregnant.
But I believe that you already know how my father is disposed how free in these affairs he has been, and how great a lover of many a woman, if any object once has captivated him.
Un­ known to her husband, he began to love Alcmena, and took temporary possession of her person for himself, and made her pregnant, too, by his embrace.
Now, that more fully you may understand the matter with respect to Alcmena, she is preg­ nant by both;
both by her husband and by supreme Jupiter And my father is now lying here (he points to the house) in-doors with her;
and for this reason is this night made longer, while he is taking this pleasure with her whom he desires.
But he has so disguised himself, as though he were Amphitryon.
Now, that you may not be surprised at this dress of mine, in­ asmuch as I have come out here this way in servile garb, an ar­ cient and an antique circumstance, made new, will I relate to you, by reason of which I have come to you attired in this new fashion ;
for lo!
my father Jupiter, now in the house, changes himself into the likeness of Amphitryon, and all the servants who see him think it is he, so shifting in his shape does he render himself when he chooses.
I have taken on myself the form of the servant Sosia, who has gone hence together with Amphitryon on the expedition, that I may be able to serve my father in his amour, and that the servants may not be enquiring who I am, when they see me here frequenting oft the house.
Now, as they will suppose me a servant and their fellow-servant, not any one will enquire who I am, or why I'm come.
My father, now in-doors, is gratifying his inclination, and is embracing her of whom he is especially enamoured.
What has been done there at the army, my father is now re­ lating to Alcmena.
She, who really is with a paramour, thinks that he is her own husband.
There, my father is now relating how he has routed the legions of the enemy;
how he has been enriched with abundant gifts.
Those gifts which there were given to Amphitryon, we have carried off;
what he pleases, my father easily performs.
Now will Amphitryon come hither this day from the army, his servant too, whose form I am bearing.
Now, that you may be able the more easily to distinguish between us, I always shall carry these little wings here (pointing) upon my broad-brimmed cap;
then besides, for my father there will be a golden tuft beneath his cap ;
that mark will not be upon Amphitryon.
These marks no one of these domestics will be able to see;
but you will see them.
But yonder is Sosia, the servant of Amphitryon;
he is now coming yonder from the harbour, with a lantern.
I will now drive him, as he arrives, away from the house.
Attend, it will be worth the while of you spectators, for Jupiter and Mercury to perform here the actors' part.
Sos. (to himself).
What other person is there more bold than I, or who more stout of heart, who know the humours of young men1, and who am walking at this hour of night alone ?
What shall I do, if now the officers of the watch2 should thrust me into prison.
To-morrow shall I be dealt out;
from there3, just as though from a store-closet, for a whipping;
nor will it be allowed me to plead my cause, nor will there be a bit of aid from my master;
nor will there be a person but that they will imagine, all of them, that I am deserving.
And so will eight sturdy fellows be thumping on wretched me just like an anvil;
in this way, just come from foreign parts, I shall be received with hospitality by the public.
The inconsiderate­ ness of my master compels me to this, who has packed me off from the harbour at this time of night whether I would or no.
Couldn't he as well have sent me here by daylight ?
For this reason, is servitude to a man of high station a greater hardship;
for this reason is the servant of a wealthy man the more wretched:
both night and day, without ceasing, there is enough, and more than enough of work for him ;
for doing or for saying occasion is ever arising, so that you can't be at rest.
The master, abounding in servants1, and free from labour himself, thinks that whatever he happens to choose, can be done;
he thinks that just, and reckons not what the labour is;
nor will he ever consider whether he commands a thing that's reasonable or unreasonable.
Wherefore, in ser­ vitude many hardships do befall us;
in pain this burden must be borne and endured.
MERC. (to the AUDIENCE).
'Twere with better reason for me to complain of servitude after this fashion;
I, who to-day was free, and whom my father is now employing as a slave:
this fellow is complaining, who was born a slave.
Sos. (to himself).
Really I am a rascal beyond a doubt;
for only this moment it has suggested itself to me, that on my arrival I should give thanks, and address the Gods for their kindnesses vouchsafed.
For surely, by my troth, if they were only desirous to give me a return according to my deserts, they would commission some person on my arrival soundly to box my ears, since those kindnesses which they have done me I have held as worthless and of no value.
MERC. (apart).
He does what people are not generally in the habit of doing, in knowing what his deserts are.
Sos. (to himself).
What I never expected, nor any one else of my townsmen, to befall him, that same has come to pass, for us to come home safe and sound.
Victorious, the enemy con­ quered, the troops are returning home, this very mighty war brought to an end, and the enemy slain.
A city that has caused many a bitter death for the Theban people, that same has been conquered by the strength and valour of our sol­ diers, and taken by storm, under the command and conduct of my master Amphitryon in especial.
With booty, terri­ tory, and glory2, too, has he loaded his fellow-citizens, and for Creon, King of Thebes, has he firmly fixed his sway.
From the harbour he has sent me before him to his house that I may bear these tidings to his wife, how he has pro­ moted the public good by his guidance, conduct, and com­ mand.
This now will I consider, in what manner I shall address her, when I've arrived there.
If I tell a falsehood, I shall be doing as I am accustomed after my usual wont;
for when they were fighting with all their might, then with all my might I ran away.
But still I shall pretend as though I was present, and I'll tell her what I heard.
But in what manner and with what expressions it is right for me to tell my story, I still wish first to consider here with myself.
(He assumes an attitude of thought.)
In these terms will I give this narrative. “
In the first place, when we arrived there, when first we made land, Amphitryon immediately made choice of the powerful men among the chieftains.
Those he despatched on the embassy, and bade them tell his mind to the Tele­ boans;
that if without constraint and without warfare they should be ready to deliver up what was plundered and the plunderers, and if they should be ready to restore what they had carried off, he would immediately conduct the army home­ wards, that the Greeks would depart from their territory, and that he would grant peace and quietness to them :
but if they should be otherwise disposed, and not concede the things which he demanded, he, in consequence, would attack their city with extreme violence and with his men.
When the embassa­ dors had repeated these things, which Amphitryon had en­ joined, in order to the Teleboans, being men stout of heart, relying on their valour, and confident in their prowess, they rebuked our embassadors very rudely.
They answered that they were able in warfare to protect themselves and theirs, and that at once they must lead the army with all haste out of their territories.
When the embassadors brought back this mes­ sage, straightway Amphitryon drew out all his army from the encampment;
on the other side, the Teleboans led forth their legions from the town, furnished with most gorgeous arms.
After they had gone forth on either side in full array, the soldiers were marshalled, the ranks were formed.
We, after our manner and usage, drew up our legions;
the enemy, too, drew up their legions facing us.
Then either general went forth into the mid-space beyond the throng of the ranks, and they parleyed together.
It was agreed between them, that, which ever side should be conquered in that battle, they should sur­ render up their city, lands, altars, hearths, and themselves.
After that was done, the trumpets on either side gave the signal;
the earth re-echoed, they raised a shout on either side.
Each general, both upon this side and on that, offered vows to Jupiter, and then encouraged his troops.
Each man according to his ability does that which each one can and has the strength to do ;
he smites with his falchion;
the weapons crash;
the welkin bellows with the uproar of the men;
of breaths and pantings a cloud is formed;
men fall by wounds inflicted by men.
At length, as we desired, our troops conquered;
the foe fell in numbers;
ours, on the other hand, pressed on;
firm in our strength, we were victorious.
But still not one betook himself to flight, nor yet gave way at his post, but standing there1 he waged the combat.
Sooner than quit the spot, they parted with their lives;
each, as he stood, lay there and kept his rank in death.
When my master Amphitryon saw this, at once he ordered the cavalry on the right to charge.
The cavalry obeyed directly;
from the right wing, with a tremendous shout, with brisk onset they rushed on;
and rightfully did they slaughter and trample down the impious forces of the foe."MERC. (apart).
Not even one word of these has he yet uttered correctly;
for I was there in the battle personally, and my father too, when it was fought.
Sos. (continuing). " The enemy betook themselves to flight.
Then was new spirit added to our men, the Teleboans flying, with darts were their bodies filled, and Amphi­ tryon himself, with his own hand, struck off the head of Pterelas their king.
This battle was being fought there even from the morning till the evening.
This do I the better remember for this reason ;
because on that day I went with­ out my breakfast.
But night at last, by its interposing, cut short this combat.
The next day, the chiefs came weep­ ing from the city to us at the camp.
With covered hands2, they entreated us to pardon their offences;
and they all sur- rendered up themselves, and all things divine and human, their city and their children, into the possession and unto the disposal of the Theban people.
Lastly, by reason of his va­ lour, a golden goblet was presented to my master Amphitryon, from which king Pterelasl had been used to drink."
These things I'll thus tell my mistress.
I'll now proceed to obey my master's order and to betake me home.
(He moves.)MERC. (apart).
Heyday!
he's about to come this way;
I'll go meet him ;
and I'll not permit this fellow at any time to-day to approach this house.
Since 1 have his form upon myself, I'm resolved to play the fellow off.
And indeed, since I have taken upon me his figure and his station, it is right for me likewise to have actions and manners like to his.
Therefore it befits me to be artful, crafty, very cunning, and by his own weapon, artfulness, to drive him from the door.
But what means this ?
He is looking up at the sky.
I'll watch what scheme he's about.
Sos. (lookillg up at the sky).
Upon my faith, for sure, if there is aught besides that I believe, or know for cer­ tain, I do believe that this night the God of Night2 has gone to sleep drunk;
for neither does the Wain move itself in any direction in the sky, nor does the Moon bestir herself anywhere from where she first arose;
nor does Orient or the Evening Star4, or the Pleiades, set.
In such a fashion are the stars standing stock-still, and the night is yielding not a jot to the day.
MERC. (apart).
Go on, Night, as you've begun, and pay obedience to my father.
In best style1, the best of services are you performing for the best of beings;
in giving this, you reap a fair return.
SOS. (to himself).
I do not think that I have ever seen a longer night than this, except one of like fashion, which live­ long night I was hanging up, having been first whipped.
Even that as well, by my troth, does this one by far exceed in its length.
I' faith, I really do believe that the Sun'a asleep, and is thoroughly drenched.
It's a wonder to me if he hasn't indulged himself a little too much at dinner.
MERC. (apart).
Do you really say so, you scoundrel ?
Do you think that the Gods are like yourself ?
I' faith, you hang-dog, I'll entertain you for these speeches and misdeeds of yours;
only come this way, will you, and you'll find your ruin.
Sos. (to himself).
Where are those wenchers, who unwil­ lingly lie a-bed alone?
A rare night this for making the best of what was a bad bargain at first2.
MERC. (apart).
My father then, according to this fellow's words, is doing rightly and wisely, who in his amorousness, indulging his passion, is lying in the embraces of Alcmena.
Sos. (to himself).
I'll go tell Alcmena, as my master ordered me.
(Advancing, he discovers MERCURY.)
But who is this fellow that I see before the house at this time of night ?
I don't like it.
MERC. (aside).
There is not in existence another such cow­ ardly fellow as this.
Sos. (aside).
Now, when I think of it, this fellow wishes to take my mantle off once more3.
MERC. (aside).
The fellow's afraid;
I'll have some sport with him.
Sos. (aside).
I'm quite undone, my teeth are chattering.
For sure, on my arrival, he is about to receive me with the hospitality of his fist.
He's a merciful person, I suppose;
now, because my master has obliged me to keep awake, with his fists just now he'll be making me go to sleep.
I'm most confoundedly undone.
Troth now, prithee, look, how big and how strong he is.
MERC. (aside).
I'll talk at him aloud, he shall hear what I say.
Therefore indeed, in a still greater degree, shall he conceive fears within himself.
(In a loud voice, holding up hisfists.)
Come, fists, it's a long time now since you found provision for my stomach ;
it seems to have taken place quite a long time ago, when yesterday yon laid four men asleep, stript naked.
Sos. (ȧside).
I'm dreadfully afraid lest I should be chang­ ing my name here, and become a Quintusl instead of a Sosia.
He declares that he has laid four men asleep;
I fear lest I should be adding to that number.
MERC. (throwing about his arms).
Well, now then for it.
This is the way I intend.
Sos. (aside).
He is girded tight;
for sure, he's getting himself ready.
MERC.
He shan't get off without getting a thrashing..
Sos. (aside).
What person, I wonder?
MERe.
Beyond a doubt, whatever person comes this way, he shall eat my fists.
Sos. (aside).
Get out with you, I don't wish to eat at this time of night;
I've lately dined.
Therefore do you, if you are wise, bestow your dinner on those who are hungry.
MERe.
The weight of this fist is no poor one.
Sos. (aside).
I'm done for;
he is poising his fists.
MERC.
What if I were to touch him, stroking him down2, so that he may go to sleep ?
Sos. (aside).
You would be proving my salvation;
for I've been watching most confoundedly these three nights running3.
MERC.
My hand refuses to learn to strike his cheek;
it cannot do a disgraceful action.
Hand of mine, of a changed form must he become whom you smite with this fist.
Sos. (aside).
This fellow will be furbishing me up, and be moulding my face anew.
MERC. (to his fist).
The man that you hit full, his face must surely be boned.
Sos. (aside).
It's a wonder if this fellow isn't thinking of boning me just like a lamprey.
Away with a fellow that bones people!
If he sees me, I'm a dead roan.
MERC.
Some fellow is stinking to his destruction.
Sos. (aside).
Woe to me!
Is it I that stink ?
MERC.
And he cannot be very far off;
but he has been a long way off from here.
Sos. (aside).
This person's a wizard1.
MERC.
My fists are longing.
Sos. (aside).
If you are going to exercise them upon me, I beg that you'll first cool them down against the wall.
MERC.
A voice has come flying to my ears.
Sos. (aside).
Unlucky fellow, for sure, was I, who didn't clip its wings.
I've got a voice with wings, it seems.
MERC.
This fellow is demanding of me for himself a heavy punishment for his beast's back2.
Sos. (aside).
As for me, I've got no beast's back.
MERC.
He must be well loaded with my fists.
Sos. (aside).
I' faith, I'm fatigued, coming from board ship, when I was brought hither ;
even now I'm sea-sick.
With­ out a burden, I can hardly creep along, so don't think that with a load I can go.
MERC.
Why, surely, somebody3 is speaking here.
Sos. (aside).
I'm all right, he doesn't see me;
he thinks it's “ Somebody" speaking:
Sosia is certainly my name.
MERC.
But here, from the right-hand side, the voice, as it seems, strikes upon my ear.
Sos. (aside).
I'm afraid that I shall be getting a thrashing here this day, in place of my voice, that's striking him.
(Moves.)MERC.
Here he is—he's coming towards me, most oppor­ tunely.
Sos. (aside).
I'm terrified—I'm numbed all over.
Upon my faith, I don't know where in the world I now am, if any one should ask me;
and to my misfortune, I cannot move myself for fright.
It's all up with me;
the orders of his master and Sosia are lost together.
But I'm determined boldly to address this fellow to his face, so that I may be able to appear valiant to him;
that he may keep his hands off me (Advances towards the door.)MERC. (accosting him).
Where are you going, you that are carrying Vulcan enclosed in your horn1 ?
Sos.
Why do you make that enquiry, you who are boning men's heads with your fists ?
MERC.
Are you slave or free man ?
Sos.
Just as it suits my inclination.
MERC.
Do you really say so ?
Sos.
I really do say so.
MERC.
Whip-scoundrel2!
Sos.
Now you are telling a lie.
MERC.
But I'll soon make you own that I'm telling the truth.
Sos.
What necessity is there for it?
MERC.
Can I know whence you have set out, whose you are, or why you are come ?Sos. (pointing).
This way I'm going, and I'm the servant of my master.
Are you any the wiser now ?
MERC.
I'll this day make you be holding that foul tongue of yours.
Sos.
You can't;
it is kept pure3 and becomingly.
MERC.
Do you persist in chattering ?
What business now have you at this house ?
(-Points to the house.), Sos. Aye, and what business have you ?
MERC.
King Creon always sets a watch every night.
Sos.
He does right;
because we were abroad, he has been protecting our house.
But however, do go in now, and say that some of the family servants have arrived.
MERC.
How far you are one of the family servants I don't know.
But unless you are off from here this instant, family servant as you are, I'll make you to be received in no familiar style.
Sos.
Here, I say, I live, and of these people I am the servant.
MERC.
But do you understand how it is P Unless you are off, I'll make you to be exaltedl this day.
Sos.
In what way, pray ?
MERC.
You shall be carried off, you shan't walk away, if I take up a stick.
Sos.
But I declare that I am one of the domestics of this family.
MERC.
Consider, will you, how soon you want a drubbing, unless you are off from here this instant.
Sos.
Do you want, as I arrive from foreign parts, to drive me from my home ?
MERC.
Is this your home ?
Sos.
It is so, I say.
MERC.
Who is your master, then ?
Sos.
Amphitryon, who is now the general of the Theban forces, to whom Alcmena is married.
MERC.
How say you ?
What's your name ?
Sos.
The Thebans call me Sosia, the son of my father Davus.
MERC.
Assuredly, at your peril have you come here this day, with your trumped-up lies, your patched-up knaveries, you essence of effrontery.
Sos.
Why no, it's rather with garments patched-up that I'm arrived here, not with knaveries.
MERC.
Why, you are lying again;
you come with your feet, surely, and not with your garments.
Sos.
Yes, certainly.
MERC.
Then certainly take that for your lie.
(He strikes him.)Sos.
By my troth, I certainly don't wish for it of course.
MERC.
But by my faith, you certainly shall have it of course, whether you wish or not:
for, in fact, this is certainly my de­ termination, and it is not at your own option.
(He strikes him.)Sos.
Mercy, I entreat of you.
MERC.
Do you dare to say that you are Sosia, when I my­ self am he ?
(Strikes him.)Sos. (crying at the top of his voice).
I'in being murdered.
MERC.
Why, you are crying out for a trifle as yet, com­ pared with what it will be.
Whose are you now ?
Sos.
Your own;
for with your fists you have laid hands on me1.
Help, help, citizens of Thebes.
(MERCURY strik­ ing him.)MERC.
What, still bawling, you scoundrel ?
Speak-what have you come for?
Sos.
For there to be somebody for you to belabour with your fists.
MERC.
Whose are you ?
Sos. Amphitryon's Sosia, I tell you.
MERC.
For this reason then you shall be beaten the more, because you prate thus idly;
I am Sosia, not you.
Sos. (aside).
I wish the Gods would have it so, that you were he in preference, and that I were thrashing you.
MERC.
What, muttering still?
(Strikes him).
Sos. I'll hold my tongue then.
MERC.
Who is your master ?
Sos.
Whoever you like.
MERC.
How then ?
What's your name now ?
Sos.
Nothing but what you shall command.
MERC.
You said that you were Amphitryon's Sosia.
Sos.
I made a mistake;
but this I meant to say, that I was Amphitryon's associatedMERC.
Why, I was sure that we had no servant called Sosia except myself.
Your senses are forsaking you.
Sos.
I wish that those fists of yours had done so.
MERC.
I am that Sosia, whom you were just now telling me that you are.
Sos.
I pray that I may be allowed to discourse with you in quietness, so as not to be beaten.
MERC.
Well then, let there be a truce for a short time, if you want to say anything.
Sos.
I'll not speak unless peace is concluded, since you are the stronger with your fists.
MERC.
If you wish to say anything, speak ;
I'll not hurt you.
Sos.
Am I to trust in your word ?
MERC.
Ies, in my word.
Sos.
What, if you deceive me?
MicRo.
Why, then may Mercury be angry with Sosia1.
Sos.
Then give.
attention:
now I'm at liberty to say in free­ dom anything I please.
I am Sosia, servant of Amphitryon.
MERC.
What, again?
(Offering to strike him.)Sos.
I have concluded the peace, ratified the treaty—I speak the truth.
MERC.
Take that, then.
(He strikes him.)Sos.
As you please, and what you please, pray do, since you are the stronger with your fists.
But whatever you shall do, still, upon my faith, I really shall not be silent about that.
MERC.
SO long as you live, you shall never make me to be any other than Sosia at this moment.
Sos.
I' faith, you certainly shall never make me to be any other person than my own self;
and besides myself we have no other servant of the name of Sosia—myself, who went hence on the expedition together with Amphitryon.
MERC.
This fellow is not in his senses.
Sos.
The malady that you impute to me, you have that same yourself.
How, the plague, am I not Sosia, the servant of Amphitryon ?
Has not our ship, which brought me, arrived here this night from the Persian port2 ?
Has not my master sent me here?
Am I not now standing before our house?
Have I not a lantern in my hand ?
Am I not talking ?
Am I not wide awake ?
Has not this fellow been thumping me with his fists ?
By my troth3, he has been doing so ;
for even now, to my pain, my cheeks are tingling.
Why, then, do I hesitate ?
Or why don't I go in-doors into our house ?
(He makes towards the door.)MERE. (stepping between).
How-your house?
Sos.
Indeed it really is so.
MERC.
Why, all that you have been saying just now, you have trumped up ;
I surely am Amphitryon's Sosia.
For in the night this ship of ours weighed anchor from the Persian port, and where king Pterelas reigned, the city we took by storm, and the legions of the Teleboans in fighting we took by arms, and Amphitryon himself cut off the head of king Pterelas in battle.
Sos. (aside).
I do not trust my own self, when I hear him affirm these things;
certainly, he really does relate exactly the things that were done there.
(Aloud.)
But how say you ?
What spoil from the Teleboans was made a present to Amphitryon?
MERC.
A golden goblet, from which king Pterelas used to drink.
Sos. (aside).
He has said the truth.
Where now is this goblet ?
MERC.
'Tis in a casket, sealed with the seal of Amphi.
tryon.
Sos.
Tell me, what is the seal ?
MERC.
The Sun rising with his chariot.
Why are you on the catch for me, you villain ?Sos. (aside).
He has overpowered me with his proofs.
I must look out for another name.
I don't know from whence he witnessed these things.
I'll now entrap him finely;
for what I did alone by myself, and when not another person was pre­ sent in the tent, that, he certainly will never be able this day to tell me.
(Aloud.)
If you are Sosia, when the armies were fighting most vigorously, what were you doing in the tent P If you tell me that, I'm vanquished.
MERC.
There was a cask of wine;
from it I filled an earthen pot1.
Sos. (aside).
He has got upon the track.
MERC.
That I drew full of pure wine, just as it was born from the mother grape.
Sos. (aside).
It's a wonder if this fellow wasn't lying hid inside of that earthen pot.
It is the fact, that there I did drink an earthen pot full of wine.
MERC.
Well—do I now convince you by my proofs that you are not Sosia ?
Sos.
Do you deny that I am ?
MERC.
Why should I not deny it, who am he myself?
Sos.
By Jupiter
I swear that I am he, and that I do not say false.
MERC.
But by Mercury, I swear that Jupiter does not believe you;
for I am sure that he will rather credit me without an oath than you with an oath.
Sos.
Who am I, at all events, if I am not Sosia ?
I ask you that.
MERC.
When I choose not to be Sosia, then do you be Sosia;
now, since I am he, you'll get a thrashing, if you are not off hence, you fellow without a name.
Sos. (aside).
Upon my faith, for sure, when I examine him and recollect my own figure, just in such manner as I am (I've often looked in a glass1), he is exactly like me.
He has the broad-brimmed hat and clothing just the same;
he is as like me as I am myself.
His leg, foot, stature, shorn head, eyes, nose, even his lips, cheeks, chin, beard, neck-the whole of him.
What need is there of words ?
If his back is marked with scars, than this likeness there is nothing more like.
But when I reflect, really, I surely am the same person that I always was.
My master I know, I know our house;
I am quite in my wits and senses.
I'm not going to obey this fellow in what he says;
I'll knock at the door.
(Goes towards the door.)MERC.
Whither are you betaking yourself?
Sos. Home.
MERC.
If now you were to ascend the chariot of Jove and fly away from here, then you could hardly be able to escape destruction.
Sos. Mayn't
I be allowed to deliver the message to my mistress that my master ordered me to give ?
MERC.
If you want to deliver any message to your own mistress;
this mistress of mine I shall not allow you to ap­ roach.
But if you provoke me, you'll be just now taking hence your loins broken.
Sos.
In preference, I'll be off.
(Aside.)
Immortal Gods, I do beseech your mercy.
Where did I lose myself?
Where have I been transformed ?
Where have I parted with my figure?
Or have I left myself behind there, if perchance I have forgotten it ?
For really this person has possession of all my figure, such as it formerly was.
While living, that is done for me, which no one will ever do for me when dead1.
I'll go to the harbour, and I'll tell my master these things as they have happened-unless even he as well shall not know me, which may Jupiter grant, so that this day, bald, with shaven crown, I may assume the cap of freedom2.
(Exit.MERC.
Well and prosperously has this affair gone on for me;
from the door have I removed the greatest obstacle, so that it may be allowed my father to embrace her in security.
When now he shall have reached his master, Amphitryon there, he will say that the servant Sosia has repulsed himself from the door here;
and then the other will suppose that he is telling him a lie, and will not believe that he has come here as he had ordered him.
Both of them and the whole household of Amphitryon I will fill with mistakes and distraction, even until my father shall have had full enjoyment of her whom he loves;
then at last all shall know what has been done.
In the end Jupiter shall restore Alcmena to the former affection of her husband.
For Amphitryon will just now be beginning a quarrel with his wife, and will be accusing her of in­ continence ;
then will my father change for her this strife into tranquillity.
Now, inasmuch as yet I've said but little about Alcmena, this day will she bring forth two sons, twins;
the one will be born in the tenth month after he was be­ gotten, the other in the seventh month1;
of these the one is the son of Amphitryon2, the other of Jupiter.
But of the younger son the father is the superior, of the elder the inferior.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Now do you comprehend this how it is ?
But for the sake of the.honor3 of this Alcmena, my father will take care that it shall happen at one birth, so that in one tra­ vail she may complete her double pangs, and not be laid under suspicion of unchastity, and that the clandestine connexion may remain concealed.
Although, as I have said just now, Amphitryon shall still know all the matter in the end.
What then ?
No one surely will impute it to Alcmena as a disgrace;
for it does not seem that a God is acting justly to permit his own offences and his own faultiness to fall upon a mortal.
I'll cut short my talk:
the door makes a noise.
See, the counterfeit Amphitryon is coming out of doors, and together with him Alcmena, the wife that he has taken the loan of.
SCENE III.
—Enter JUPITER and ALCMENA,from the house.
JUP.
Kindly fare you well, Alcmena;
take care, as you are doing, of our common interest, and pray be sparing of yourself;
you see that now your months are completed.
It's necessary for me to go away from here;
but the offspring that shall be born do you bring up1.
ALC.
What business is this, my husband, since you thus suddenly leave your home ?
JUP.
By my troth, 'tis not that I am wearied of you or of my home;
but when the chief commander is not with the army, that is sooner done which ought not to be done than that which needs to be done.
MERC. (aside).
This is a very clever counterfeit, who really is my own father.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Do you observe him, how blandly he smoothes the lady over.
ALC.
I' faith, I find by experience how much you value your wife.
JuP.
If there is no one among women whom I love so much, are you satisfied ?MERC. (aside).
Verily, upon my faith, if Juno only knew that you were giving your attention to such matters, I'd war­ rant that you'd rather be2 Amphitryon than Jupiter.
ALC.
I would rather that I should find it so by experience, than that it should be told me.
You leave me before the spot in the bed where you have been lying has well grown warm.
Yesterday, in the middle of the night, you came, and now you are going away.
Is this your pleasure ?MERC. (aside).
I'll approach, and address her, and play second fiddle to my father.
(-Be approaches ALCMENA.)
Never, upon my faith, do I believe that any mortal did so distractedly love his wife as he distractedly dotes upon you.
JUP.
Scoundrel!—don't I know you of old?
Won't you be off out of my sight P
What business have you in this matter, whip-knave ?
or why your muttering ?
Whom this very instant, with this walking-stick, I'll(Shakes his stick over his head.)ALC.
Oh don't.
JUP.
Only make a whisper.
MERC. (aside).
My first attempt at playing second fiddle had almost come to an unfortunate conclusion.
JUP.
But as to what you say, my wife, you ought not to be angry with me.
I came away privately from the army these moments I stole for you, that you the first might know from me the first, how I had managed the common interests.
All this have I related to you.
If I had not loved you very much, I should not have done so.
MERC. (aside).
Isn't he doing just as I said?
In her alarm, he is smoothing her down.
JUP.
That the army then mayn't find it out, I must re­ turn there privately, lest they should say that I have preferred my wife before the common interests.
ALC.
By your departure you set your wife in tears.
JUP.
Be quiet;
don't spoil your eyes:
I'll return very shortly.
ALC.
That "very shortly" is a long time.
JUP.
I do not with pleasure leave you here;
or go away from you.
ALC.
I am sensible of it;
for, the night that you have come to me, on the same you go away.
(She embraces him.)JUP.
Why do you hold me ?
It is time to go:
I wish to depart from the city before it dawns.
Now, Alcmena, this goblet which has been given me there on account of my valour, from which king Pterelas used to drink, he whom 1 slew with my own hand, the same I present to you.
(-Presents to her the goblet.)ALC. (taking the goblet).
You do as you are wont in other things.
By heavens, it is a noble gift;
like him who gave the gift.
MERC.
Aye, a noble gift;
just like her to whom it has been given as a gift.
JuP.
What, still going on ?
Can't I, you scoundrel, make an end of you ?
ALC.
Amphitryon, there's a dear, don't be angry1 with Sosia on my account.
JUP.
Just as you wish I'll do.
MERC. (aside).
From his intriguing, how very savage he does become!
J UP.
Do you wish for anything else ?
Arc.
That when I am absent you will love me—me, who am yours, though absent.
MERC.
Let's go, Amphitryon;
it's already dawning.
JUP.
Go you first, Sosia. (-Exit MERCURY.)
I'll follow this instant.
(To ALCMENA.)
Is there anything you wish ?
ALC.
Yes;
that you'll come back speedily.
JUP.
I will;
and sooner than you expect will I be here therefore be of good heart.
(ALCMENA goes into the house.)JUP.
Now Night, thou who hast tarried for me, I permit thee to give place to Day, that thou mayst shine upon mortals with a bright and brilliant light.
And Night, as much as on this last thou wast too long, so much the shorter will I make the Day to be, that a Day of equal disparity may suc­ ceed the Night.
I'll go and follow Mercury.
(Exit.Enter AMPHITRYON and SOSIA, at the end of the stage.
AMPH.
Come, do you follow after me.
Sos.
I'm following;
I'm following close after you.
AMPH.
I think that you are the veriest rogueSos.
But for what reason ?
AMPH.
Because that which neither is, nor ever was, nor will be, you declare to me.
Sos.
Look at that;
you are now acting according to your usual fashion, to be putting no trust in your servants.
AMPH.
Why is it so ?
For what reason ?
Surely now, by the powers, I'll cut out that villanous tongue of yours, you villain.
Sos.
I am yours;
do each thing just as it is agreable and as it pleases you.
Still you never can, by any method, hinder me from saying these things just as they took place here.
AMPH.
You consummate villain, do you dare tell me this, that you are now at home, who are here present ?
Sos.
I speak the truth.
AMPH.
A mishap shall the Gods send upon you, and I this day will send it as well.
Sos.
That's in your power, for I am your property.
AMPH.
Do you dare, you whip-scoundrel, to play your tricks with me, your master ?
Do you dare affirm that which no person ever yet before this has seen, and which cannot pos­ sibly happen, for the same man to be in two places together at the same time ?
Sos.
Undoubtedly, such as I say is the fact.
AMPH.
May Jupiter confound you !
Sos.
What evil, master, have I been deemed deserving of in your service ?
AMPH.
Do you ask me, you rogue, who are even making sport of me ?
Sos.
With reason might you curse me, if it had not so happened.
But I tell no lie, and I speak as the thing really did happen.
AMPH.
This fellow's drunk, as I imagine.
Sos.
What, I ?
AMPH.
Yes—you there.
Sos.
I wish I were so.
AMPH.
You are wishing for that which is fact;
where have you been drinking ?
Sos.
Nowhere, indeed.
AMPH.
What is this, that is the matter with the fellow ?
Sos.
Really I have told you ten times over.
I am both at home now, I say (do you mark me ?), and I, Sosia, am with you likewise.
Don't 1 appear, master, to have told you quite distinctly, and quite circumstantially, that this is so.
AMPH.
Avaunt, get away with you from me.
AMPH.
A pestilence possesses you.
Sos.
But why do you say so to me ?
I really am quite well and in perfect health, Amphitryon.
AMPH.
But I'll make you this very day, just as you have deserved, not to be quite so well, and to be miserable instead of your perfect health, if I return home.
Follow me, you who in this fashion are making sport of your master with your crack-brained talk;
you, who, since you have neglected to perform what your master ordered, are now come even of your own accord to laugh at your master.
Things which neither can happen, and which no one ever yet heard of in talk, you are telling of, you villain;
on your back I'll take care and make those lies to tell this very day.
Sos.
Amphitryon, this is the most wretched of wretched­ ness to a good servant, who is telling the truth to his master, . if that same truth is overpowered by violence.
AMPH.
Discuss it with me by proofs.
Why, how the plague can such a thing happen, for you now to be both here and at home ?
That I want to be told.
Sos.
I really am both here and there;
this any person has a right to wonder at;
nor, Amphitryon, does this seem more strange to you than to myself.
AMPH.
In what way ?
Sos.
In no degree, I say, is this more strange to you than to myself;
nor, so may the Deities love me, did I at first credit Sosia—me myself, until that Sosia, I myself, made me to believe me myself.
In order did he relate every­ thing, as each thing came to pass, when we sojourned with the enemy;
and then besides, he has carried off my figure together with my name.
Not even is milk more like to milk than is that I myself like to me myself .
For when some time since, before daybreak, you sent me from the harbour home before you—AMPH.
What then ?
Sos.
I had been standing a long time at the door before I had got there.
AMPH.
Plague on it, what nonsense!
Are you quite in your senses ?
Sos.
I'm just as you see me.
AMPH..
Some mischief, I know not what, has befallen this fellow from an evil hand1 since he left me.
Sos.
I confess it;
for I have been most shockingly bruised with his fists.
AMPH.
Who has been beating you ?
Sos.
I myself, who am now at home, beat me myself.
AMPH.
Take you care to say nothing but what I shall ask' you.
Now, do you answer me.
First of all, who this Sosia is, of that I want to be informed.
Sos.
He is your servant.
AMPH.
Really I have even more than I desire by your own one self.
Never, too, since I was born, had I a servant Sosia besides yourself.
Sos.
But now, Amphitryon, I say this ;
I'll make you, I say, on your arrival, meet with another Sosia at home, a ser­ vant of yours, besides myself, a son of Davus, the same father with myself, of figure and age as well just like myself.
What need is there of words ?
This Sosia of yours is be­ come twofold.
AMPH.
You talk of things extremely wonderful.
But did you see my wife ?
Sos.
Nay, but it was never allowed me to go in-doors into the house.
AMPH.
Who hindered you ?
Sos.
This Sosia, whom I was just now telling of, he who thumped me.
AMPH.
Who is this Sosia?
Sos.
Myself, I say;
how often must it be told you ?
AMPH.
But how say you ?
Have you been sleeping the while ?
Sos.
Not the slightest in the world.
AMPH.
Then, perhaps, you might perchance have seen some Sosia in your dreams.
Sos.
I am not in the habit of performing the orders of my master in a sleepy fashion.
Awake I saw him, awake I now see you, awake I am talking, awake did he, a little while since, thump me about with his fists.
AMPH.
What person did so ?
Sos. Sosia, that I myself,— he, I say.
Prithee, don't you understand ?
AMPH.
How, the plague, can any one possibly under­ stand ?
You are jabbering such nonsense.
Sos.
But you'll know him shortly.
AMPH.
Whom ?
Sos.
You'll know this servant Sosia.
AMPH.
Follow me this way, then;
for it is necessary for me first to enquire into this.
But take care that all the things that I ordered are now brought from the ship.
Sos.
I am both mindful and diligent that what you order shall be performed;
together with the wine, I have not drunk up your commands.
AMPH.
May the Gods grant, that, in the event, what you have said may prove untrue.
(They stand apart.)ALC.
Is not the proportion of pleasures in life and in passing our existence short in comparison with what is dis­ agreable ?
So it is allotted to each man in life;
so has it pleased the Gods that Sorrow should attend on Pleasure a her companion;
but if aught of good befalls us, more of trouble and of ill forthwith attends us.
For this do 1 now feel by experience at home and in relation to myself, to whom delight has been imparted for a very short time, while I had the opportunity of seeing my husband for but one night;
and now has he suddenly gone away hence from me before the dawn.
Deserted do I now seem to myself, be­ cause he is absent from here, he whom before all I love.
More of grief have I felt from the departure of my husband, than of pleasure from his arrival.
But this, at least, makes me happy, that he has conquered the foe, and has returned home loaded with glory.
Let him be absent, if only with fame acquired he betakes himself home.
I shall bear and ever endure his absence with mind resolved and steadfast;
if only this reward is granted me, that my husband shall be hailed the conqueror in the warfare, sufficient for myself will I deem it.
Valour is the best reward;
valour assuredly surpasses all things:
liberty, safety, life, property and parents, country too, and children, by it are defended and preserved.
Va­ lour comprises everything in itself:
all blessings attend him in whose possession is valour.
AMPH. (apart).
By my troth, I do believe that I shall come much wished for by my wife, who loves me, and whom, in return, I love:
especially, our enterprise crowned with suc­ cess, the enemy vanquished, whom no one bad supposed to be able to be conquered:
these, under my conduct and com­ mand, at the first meeting, have we vanquished ;
but I know for sure that I shall come to her much wished for.
Sos. (aside).
Well, and don't you think that I shall come much wished for to my mistress ?
ALC. (to herself).
Surely, this is my husband.
AMPH. (tc SOSIA).
Do you follow me this way.
ALC. (to herself).
But why has he returned, when just now he said that he was in haste ?
Is he purposely trying me, and is he desirous to make proof of this, how much I regret his departure ?
By my faith, against no inclination of mine has he betaken himself home,Sos. Amphitryon, it were better for us to return to the ship.
AMPH.
For what reason ?
Sos.
Because there's no person at home to give us a breakfast on our arrival.
AMPH.
How comes that now into your mind PSos.
Why, because we have come too late.
AMPH.
How so ?
Sos.
Because I see Alcmena standing before the house, with her stomach-full1 already.
AMPH.
I left her pregnant here when I went away.
AMPH.
What's the matter with you ?
Sos.
I have come home just in good time to fetch the water2 in the tenth month after that, according as I understand you to compute the reckoning.
AMPH.
Be of good heart.
Sos.
Do you know of how good heart I am ?
By my troth, do you never after this day entrust to me aught that is sacred, if I don't draw up all the life of that well, if I do but make a beginning.
AMPH.
Do you only follow me this way.
I'll appoint an­ other person for that business;
don't you fear.
ALC. (advancing).
I think that I shall now be doing my duty more, if I go to meet him.
(They meet.)AMPH.
With joy, Amphitryon greets his longed-for wife­ her, whom of all women in Thebes her husband deems by far the most excellent, and whom so much the Theban citizens truthfully extol as virtuous.
Have you fared well all along ?
Do I arrive much wished for by you ?
Sos. (aside).
I never saw one more so ;
for she greets her own husband not a bit more than a dog.
AMPH.
When I see you pregnant, and so gracefully bur­ dened, I am delighted.
ALC.
Prithee, in the name of all that's good, why, for the sake of mockery, do you thus salute and address me, as though you hadn't lately seen me—as though now, for the first time, you were betaking yourself homeward here from the enemy ?
For now you are addressing me just as though you were seeing me after a long time.
AMPH.
Why, really for my part, I have not seen you at all this day until now.
ALC.
Why do you deny it?
AMPH.
Because I have learned to speak the truth.
ALC.
He does not do right, who unlearns the same that he has learned.
Are you making trial what feelings I possess ?
But why are you returning hither so soon ?
Has an ill omen delayed you, or does the weather keep you back, you who have not gone away to your troops, as you were lately speaking of ?
AMPH.
Lately ?
How long since was this "lately?"ALC.
You are trying me;
but very lately, just now.
AMPH.
Prithee, how can that possibly be as you say ?— “ but very lately, just now."ALC.
Why, what do you imagine ?
That I, on the other hand, shall trifle with you who are playing with me, in saying that you are now come for the first time, you who but just now went away from here ?
AMPH.
Surely she is talking deliriously.
Sos.
Stop a little while, until she has slept out this one sleep.
AMPH.
Is she not dreaming with her eyes open ?
ALC.
Upon my faith, for my part I really am awake, and awake I am relating that which has happened;
for, but lately, before daybreak, I saw both him (pointing at SOSIA) and yourself.
AMPH.
In what place ?
ALC.
Here, in the house where you yourself dwell.
AMPH.
It never was the fact.
Sos.
Will you not hold your peace ?
What if the vessel brought us here from the harbour in our sleep ?
AMPH.
Are you, too, going to back her as well ?
Sos. (aside to AMPHITRYON).
What do you wish to be done?
Don't you know, if you wish to oppose a raving Bacchanal, from a mad woman you'll render her more mad— she'll strike the oftener1;
if you humour her, after one blow you may overcome her ?
AMPH.
But, by my troth, this thing is resolved upon, somehow to rate her who this day has been unwilling to greet me on my arrival home.
Sos.
You'll only be irritating hornets.
AMPH.
You hold your tongue.
Alcmena, I wish to ask you one thing.
ALC.
Ask me anything you please.
AMPH.
Is it frenzy that has come upon you, or does pride overcome you ?
ALC.
How comes it into your mind, my husband, to ask me that ?
AMPH.
Because formerly you used to greet me on my arrival, and to address me in such manner as those women who are virtuous are wont their husbands.
On my arrival home I've found that you have got rid of that custom.
ALC.
By my faith, indeed, I assuredly did both greet you yesterday, upon your arrival, at that very instant, and at the same time I enquired if you had continued in health all along, my husband, and I took your hand and gave you a kiss.
Sos.
What, did you welcome him yesterday ?
ALC.
And you too, as well, Sosia.
Sos.
Amphitryon, I did hope that she was about to bring you forth a son;
but she isn't gone with child.
AMPH.
What then ?
Sos. With madness.
ALC.
Really I am in my senses, and I pray the Gods that in safety I may bring forth a son;
but (to SOSIA) hap-ill shall you be having, if he does his duty:
for those ominous words, omen-maker, you shall catch what befits you.
dOSe
Why really an apple1 ought to be given to the lady thus pregnant, that there may be something for her to gnaw if she should begin to faint.
AMPH.
Did you see me here yesterday ?
ALC.
I did, I say, if you wish it to be ten times repeated.
AMPH.
In your sleep, perhaps ?ALC.
NO—I, awake, saw you awake.
AMPH.
Woe to me!
Sos.
What's the matter with you?
AMPH.
My wife is mad.
Sos.
She's attacked with black bile ;
nothing so soon turns people mad.
AMPH.
When, madam, did you first find yourself affected?
ALC.
Why really, upon my faith, I'm well, and in my senses.
AMPH.
Why, then, do you say that you saw me yesterday, whereas we were brought into harbour but last night ?
There did I dine, and there did I rest the livelong night on board ship, nor have I set my foot even here into the house, since, with the army, I set out hence against the Teleboan foe, and since we conquered them.
ALC.
On the contrary, you dined with me, and you slep;
with me.
AMPH.
How so ?
ALC.
I'm telling the truth.
AMPH.
On my honor, not in this matter, really;
about other matters I don't know.
ALC.
At the very break of dawn you went away to your troops.
AMPH.
By what means could IfSos.
She says right, according as she remembers;
she's telling you her dream.
But, madam, after you arose, you ought to have sacrificed to Jove, the disposer of prodigies1, either with a salt cake or with frankincense.
ALC.
A mischief on your head !
Sos.
That's your own business, if you take due care.
ALC.
Now again this fellow is talking rudely to me, and that without punishment.
AMPH. (to SOSIA).
You hold your tongue.
(To ALC­ MENA.)
Do you tell me now—did I go away hence from you at daybreak?
ALC.
Who then but your own self recounted to me how the battle went there ?
AMPH.
And do you know that as well ?
ALC.
Why, I heard it from your own self, how you had taken a very large city, and how you yourself had slain king Pterelas.
AMPH.
What, did I tell you this ?
ALO.
You yourself, this Sosia standing by as well.
AMPH. (to SOSIA).
Have you heard me telling about this to-day ?
Sos.
Where should I have heard you ?
AMPH.
Ask her.
Sos.
In my presence, indeed, it never took place, that I know of.
Arc.
It would be a wonder1 if he didn't contradict you.
AMPH.
Sosia, come here and look at me.
Sos. (looks at him).
I am looking at you.
AMPH.
I wish you to tell the truth, and I don't want you to humour me.
Have you heard me this day sav to her these things which she affirms ?
Sos.
Prithee now, by my troth, are you, too, mad as well, when you ask me this, me, who, for my part, my own self now behold her in company with you for the first time ?
AMPH.
How now, madam ?
Do you hear him ?
ALC.
I do, indeed, and telling an untruth.
AMPH.
Do you believe neither him nor my own self, your husband ?
Arc. NO;
for this reason it is, because I most readily be­ lieve myself, and I am sure that these things took place just as I relate them.
AMPH.
Do you say that I came yesterday ?
ALC.
Do you deny that you went away from here to-day ?
AMPH.
I really do deny it, and I declare that I have now come home to you for the first time.
ALC.
Prithee, will you deny this too, that you to-day made me a present of a golden goblet, with which you said that you had been presented ?
AMPH.
By heavens, I neither gave it nor told you so :
but I had so intended, and do so now, to present you with that goblet.
But who told you this ?
ALC.
Why, I heard it from yourself, and I received the goblet from your own hand.
(She moves as if going.)AMPH.
Stay, stay, I entreat you.
Sosia, I marvel much how she knows that I was presented there with this golden goblet, unless you have lately met her and told her all this.
Sos.
Upon my faith, I have never told her, nor have I ever beheld her except with yourself.
AMPH.
What is the matter2 with this person ?
ALC.
Should you like the goblet to be produced ?
AMPH.
I should like it to be produced.
ALC.
Be it.
so.
Do you go, Thessala, and bring from in- doors the goblet, with which my husband presented me to- day.
(THESSALA goes into the house, and AMPHITRYON and SOSIA walk on one side.)
AMPH.
Sosia, do you step this way.
Really, I do wonder extremely at this beyond the other wondrous matters, if she has got this goblet,Sos.
And do you believe it, when it's carried in this casket, sealed with your own seal.
(He shows the ca8ket.)AMPH.
Is the seal whole ?
Sos. Examine it.AMPH. (examining it).
All right, it's just as I sealed it up.
Sos.
Prithee, why don't you order her to be purifiedl as a frantic person?
AMPH.
By my troth, somehow there's need for it, for, i' faith, she's certainly filled with sprites.
ALC.
What need is there of talking?
See, here's the goblet;
here it is.
AMPH.
Give it me.
ALO.
Come, now then, look here, if you please, you who deny what is fact, and whom I shall now clearly convict in this case.
Isn't this the goblet with which you were pre­ sented there ?
AMPH.
Supreme Jupiter!
what do I behold ?
Surely this is that goblet.
Sosia, I'm utterly confounded.
Sos.
Upon my faith, either this woman is a most consum­ mate juggler, or the goblet must be in here (pointing to the casket).
AMPH.
Come, then, open this casket.
Sos.
Why should I open it ?
It is securely sealed.
The thing is cleverly contrived ;
you have brought forth another Amphitryon, I have brought forth another Sosia;
now if the goblet has brought forth a goblet, we have all produced our doubles.
AMPH.
I'm determined to open and examine it.
Sos.
Look, please, how the seal is, that you may not hereafter throw the blame on me.
AMPH.
Now do open it.
For she certainly is desirous to drive us mad with her talking.
ALC.
Whence then came this which was made a present to ne, but from yourself?
AMPH.
It's necessary for me to enquire into this.
Sos. (opening the casket).
Jupiter, 0 Jupiter!
AMPH.
What is the matter with you ?
Sos.
There's no goblet here in the casket.
AMPH.
What do I hear.
Sos.
That which is the truth.
AMPH.
But at your peril now, if it does not make its ap­ pearance.
ALC. (showing it).
Why, it does make its appearance.
AMPH.
Who then gave it you ?
ALC.
The person that's asking me the question.
Sos. (to AMPHITRYON).
You are on the catch for me, in­ asmuch as you yourself have secretly run before me hither from the ship by another road, and have taken the goblet away from here and given it to her, and afterwards you have secretly sealed it up again.
AMPH.
Ah me!
and are you too helping her frenzy as well ?
(To ALCMENA )
Do you say that we arrived here yes­ terday ?
ALC.
I do say so, and on your arrival you instantly greeted me, and I you, and I gave you a kiss.
Sos. (aside).
That beginning now about the kiss doesn't please me.
AMPH.
Go on telling it.
ALC.
Then, you bathed.
AMPH.
What, after I bathed ?
Arc.
You took your place at table.
Sos. Bravo, capital!
Now make further enquiry.
AMPH. (to SOSIA).
Don't you interrupt.
(To ALCMENA).
Go on telling me.
ALC.
The dinner was served;
you dined with me;
I reclined together with you at the repast.
AMPH.
What, on the same couch ?
ALC.
On the same.
Sos.
Oh dear, I don't like this banquet.
AMPH.
Now do let her give her proofs.
(To ALCMENA.)
What, after we had dined ?
ALC.
You said that you were inclined to go to sleep;
the table was removed;
thence we went to bed.
AMPH.
Where did you lie ?
ALC.
In the chamber, in the same bed together with your­ self.
AMPH.
You have proved my undoing.
Sos.
What's the matter with you ?
AMPH.
This very moment has she sent me to my grave.
ALC.
How so, pray ?
AMPH.
Don't address me.
Sos.
What's the matter with you ?
AMPH.
To my sorrow I'm undone, since, in my absence from here, dishonor has befallen her chastity.
Arc.
In heaven's name, my lord, why, I beseech you, do I hear this from you ?
AMPH.
I, your lord ?
False one, don't call me by a false name.
Sos. (aside).
'Tis an odd matter!
this, if indeed he has been made into my lady from my lord.
ALC.
What have I done, by reason of which these ex­ pressions are uttered to me ?
AMPH.
You yourself proclaim your own doings;
do you enquire of me in what you have offended ?
ALC.
In what have I offended you, if I have been with you to whom I am married PAMPH.
You, been with me ?
What is there of greater effrontery than this impudent woman?
At least, if you were wanting in modesty of your own, you might have bor­ rowed it.
ALC.
That criminality which you lay to my charge befits not my family.
If you try to catch me in incontinence, you cannot convict me.
AMPH.
Immortal Gods!
do you at least know me, Sosia ?
Sos.
Pretty well.
AMPH.
Did I not dine yesterday on board ship in the Persian Port ?ALC.
I have witnesses as well, who can confirm that which I say.
Sos.
I don't know what to say to this matter, unless, perchance, there is another Amphitryon, who, perhaps, though you yourself are absent, takes care of your business, and who, in your absence, performs your duties here.
For about that counterfeit Sosia it is very surprising.
Certainly, about this Amphitryon, now, it is another matter still more surprising.
AMPH.
Some magician, I know not who, is bewildering this woman.
ALC.
By the realms of the supreme Sovereign I swear, and by Juno, the matron Goddess, whom for line to fear anu venerate it is most especially fitting, that no mortal being!
except yourself alone has ever touched my person in contact with his so as to render me unchaste.
AMPH.
I could wish that that was true.
ALC.
I speak the truth, but in vain, since you will not believe me.
AMPH.
You are a woman;
you swear at random.
Arc.
She who has not done wrong, her it befits to be bold and to speak confidently and positively in her own behalf.
AMPH.
That's very boldly said.
ALC.
Just as befits a virtuous woman.
AMPH.
Say you so ?
By your own words you prove it.
Arc.
That which is called a dowry, I do not deem the same my dowry;
but chastity, and modesty, and subdued desires, fear of the Gods, and love of my parents, and con­ cord with my kindred;
to be obedient to yourself, and bounteous to the good, ready to aid the upright.
Sos.
Surely, by my troth, if she tells the truth in this, she's perfect to the very ideal2.
AMPH.
Really I am so bewildered, that I don't know my­ self who I am.
Sos.
Surely you are Amphitryon;
take you care, please, that you don't peradventure lose yourself;
people are chang­ ing in such a fashion since we came from abroad.
AMPH.
Madam, I'm resolved not to omit having this matter enquired into.
ALC.
I' faith, you'll do so quite to my satisfaction.
AMPH.
How say you P Answer me;
what if I bring your own kinsman, Naucrates, hither from the ship, who, together with me, has been brought on board the same ship;
and if he denies that that has happened which you say has happened, what is proper to be done to you ?
Do you allege any reason why I should not at your cost dissolves this our marriage ?
ALC.
If I have done wrong, there is no reason.
AMPH.
Agreed.
Do you, Sosia, take these1 people in-doors.
I'll bring Naucrates hither with me from the ship.
(-Exit.Sos. (going close to ALCMENA).
Now then, there's no one here except ourselves;
tell me the truth seriously, is there any Sosia in-doors who is like myself ?
ALC.
Won't you hence away from me, fit servant for your master?
Sos.
If you command me, I'm off.
(Goes into the house.)ALC. (to herself).
By heavens, it is a very wondrous prd­ ceeding, how it has pleased this husband of mine thus to accuse me falsely of a crime so foul.
Whatever it is, I shall now learn it from my kinsman Naucrates.
(Goes into the house.)JUP.
I am that Amphitryon, whose servant Sosia is the same that becomes Mercury when there is occasion—I, who dwell in the highest story3, who sometimes, when it pleases me, become Jupiter.
But, hither soon as ever I turn my steps, I become Amphitryon that moment, and I change my garb.
Now hither am I come for the sake of a compliment to you, that I may not leave this Comedy incomplete.
I've come as well to bring assistance to Alcmena, whom, guiltless woman, her husband Amphitryon is accusing of dishonor.
For what I myself have brought about, if that undeservedly should fall as an injury upon her in her innocence, it would be my blame.
Now, as I have already begun, I'll again pretend that I am Amphitryon, and this day will I introduce extreme confusion into this household.
Then afterwards, at last, I'll cause the matter to be disclosed, and to Alcmena timely aid will I bring, and will cause that at one birth she shall bring forth, without pangs1, both the child with which she is preg­ nant by her husband and that with which she is pregnant by myself.
I have ordered Mercury forthwith to follow me, if I should wish to give him any commands.
Now will I accost her.
(-He stands apart.)ALC.
I cannot remain in the house.
That I should be thus accused by my husband of dishonor, incontinence, and dis­ grace !
he cries aloud that things which have been done, have really not been done;
and of things which have not been done, and of which I have not been guilty, he accuses me, and supposes that I shall treat it with indifference.
By heavens, I will not do so, nor will I allow myself to be falsely charged with dishonor;
but rather I'll either leave him, or make him give satisfaction and swear as well2 that he wishes unsaid the things which he has alleged against me in my innocence.
JuP. (apart).
This must be done by me, which she requires to be done, if I wish for her to receive me into her company as loving her:
since that which I have done, that same con­ duct has proved to the detriment of Amphitryon, and since my love has already created trouble for him who is really guiltless, why now his wrath and his resentment towards her shall fall on me that am not accused.
ALC.
And lo!
I see him, who just now was accusing wretched me of incontinence and dishonor.
JuP. (advancing).
Wife, I would discourse with you.
(She turns from him.)
Why turn yourself away ?
Arc.
Such is my disposition;
I always hate to look upon my enemies.
JUP.
Heyday!
enemies indeed3!
ALC.
It is so, I speak the truth ;
unless you are going to allege that this is falsely said as well.
JuP. (offering to embrace her).
You are too angry.
ALC. (repulsing him).
Can't you keep your hands off?
For surely if you were wise, or quite in your senses, with her, whom you deem and pronounce to be unchaste, you would neither hold discourse, in mirth or in seriousness, unless, indeed, you are more foolish than the most foolish.
JUP.
If I did say so, not a bit the more are you so, nor do I think you so, and therefore have I returned hither that I might excuse myself to you.
For never has anything proved more grievous to my feelings than when I heard that you were angry with me.
"
Why did you charge me ?" you will say.
I'll tell you ;
by my troth, not that I deemed you to be unchaste;
but I was trying your feelings, what you would do, and in what manner you would bring yourself to bear it.
Really, I said these things to you just now in jest, for the sake of the joke.
Do but ask Sosia this.
ALC.
But why don't you bring here my kinsman, Nau­ crates, whom you said just now that you would bring as a witness that you had not come here ?
JUP.
If anything was said in joke, it isn't right for you to take it in earnest.
ALC.
I know how much this has pained me at heart.
JUP.
Prithee, Alcmena (taking her hand), by your right hand I do entreat you, grant me pardon;
forgive me, don't be angry.
ALC.
By my virtue have I rendered these accusations vain.
Since then I eschew conduct that's unchaste, I would wish to avoid imputations of unchastity.
Fare you well, keep your own1 property to yourself, return me mine.
Do you order any maids to be my attendants ?
JUP.
Are you in your senses ?
ALC.
If you don't order them, let me go alone;
chastity shall I take as my attendant.
( Going.)JUP.
Stay-at your desire, I'll give my oath that I believe my wife2 to be chaste.
If in that I deceive you, then, thee, supreme Jupiter, do I entreat that thou wilt ever be angered against1 Amphitryon.
ALC.
Oh !
rather may he prove propitious.
J UP.
I trust that it will be so ;
for before you have I taken a truthful oath.
Now then, you are not angry ?
ALC.
I am not.
JUP.
You act properly.
For in the life of mortals many things of this nature come to pass ;
andnow they take their pleasures, again they meet with hardships.
Quarrels intervene, again do they become reconciled.
But if perchance any quarrels of this nature happen between them, when again they have become reconciled, twofold more loving are they between themselves than they were before.
ALC.
At the first you ought to have been careful not to say so;
but if you excuse yourself to me for the same, it must be put up with.
JuP.
But bid the sacred vessels to be got ready for me, that I may fulfil all those vows which I made when with the army, in case I should return safe home.
ALC.
I'll take care of that.
JUP. (To a SERVANT).
Call out Sosia hither.
Let him fetch Blepharo, the pilot that was on board my ship, to breakfast with us.
(Aside.)
He shall be fooled this day2 so as to go without his breakfast, while I shall drag Amphitryon hence by the throat.
ALC. (aside).
It's surprising what he can be arranging alone in secrecy with himself.
But the door opens;
Sosia's coming out.
Sos.
Amphitryon, I'm here;
if any way you have need of me, command me ;
your commands I will obey.
JUP.
Very opportunely are you come.
Sos.
Has peace been made then between you two ?
But since I see you in good humour, I'm delighted, and it is a pleasure to myself.
And so does it seem becoming for a trusty servant to conduct himself;
just as his superiors are, so should he be likewise;
by their countenances he should fashion his own countenance;
if his superiors are grave, let him be grave;
if they rejoice, let him be merry.
But come, answer me;
have you two now come to a reconciliation ?
JUP.
You are laughing at me, who know full well that these things were just now said by me in joke.
Sos.
In joke did you say it ?
For my part, I supposed that it was said seriously and in truthfulness.
JUP.
Still, I've made my excuses;
and peace has been made.
Sos.
'Tis very good.
JUP.
I shall now perform the sacri­ ' fice in-doors, and the vows which I have made.
Sos.
So I suppose.
JUP.
Do you invite hither, in my name, Blepharo, the pilot, from the ship, so that when the sacrifice has been performed, he may breakfast with me.
Sos.
I shall be here again, while you'll be thinking that I'm there.
JUP.
Return here directly.
(Exit SOSIA.)
ALC.
Do you wish for anything else, but that I should go in-doors now, that the things that are requisite may be got ready ?
JUP.
Go then, and take care that everything is prepared as soon as possible.
ALC.
Why, come in-doors whenever you please;
I'll take care that there shall not be any delay.
JUP.
You say well, and just as befits an attentive wife.
(ALCMENA.
goes into the house.)JUP.
Now both of these, both servant and mistress, are, the pair of them, deceived, in taking me to be Amphitryon;
egregiously do they err.
Now, you immortal Sosia, take you care and be at hand for me.
You hear what I say, although you are not present here.
Take care that you contrive to drive away Amphitryon, on his arrival just now, by some means or other, from the house.
I wish him to be cajoled, while with this borrowed wife I now indulge myself.
Please, take care that this is attended to just in such way as you know that I desire, and that you assist me while to myself I am offering sacrifice1.
(Goes into AMPHITRYON'S house.)MERC.
Stand by and make room all of you, get you out of the way.
And let not any person now be so presumptuous as to stand before me in the road.
For surely, why, by my troth, should I, a God, be any less allowed to threaten the public, if it does not get out of my way, than a slave in Comedies1 ?
He is bringing news that the ship is safe, or else the ap­ proach of some angry old blade ;
whereas I am obeying the bidding of Jove, and by his command do I now hie me.
For this reason, it is more fitting to get out of the road and to make room for me.
My father calls me, I am following him, to his orders so given am I obedient.
As it befits a son to be dutiful to his father, just so am I to my.
father;
in his amours I play second fiddle to him, I encourage him, assist him, advise him, rejoice with him.
If anything is pleasing to my father, that pleasure is an extremely great one for myself.
Is he amorously disposed ?
He is wise;
he does right, inas­ much as he follows his inclination;
a thing that all men ought to do, so long as it is done in a proper manner.
Now, my father wishes Amphitryon to be cajoled;
I'll take care, Spec­ tators, that he shall be rarely cajoled, while you look on.
I'll place a chaplet on my head, and pretend that I am drunk.
And up there (pointing to the top of the house) will I get;
from that spot, at the top of the house, I'll cleverly drive this person off when he comes hither:
I'll take care that, sober, he shall be drenched.
Afterwards, his own servant Sosia will pre- sently be suffering the punishment for it;
he'll be accusing him of doing, this day, the things which I myself have done what's that to me P It's proper for me to be obedient to my father;
it's right to be subservient to his pleasure.
But see !
here is Amphitryon;
he's coming.
Now shall he be rarely fooled, if, indeed, (to the AUDIENCE) you are willing, by listen­ ing, to lend your attention.
I'll go in-doors, and assume a garb1 that more becomes me;
then I'll go up upon the roof, that I may drive him off from hence.
(Goes into the house, andfastens the door.)AMPH. (to himself).
Naucrates, whom I wanted to find, was not on board ship;
neither at home nor in the city do I meet with any one that has seen him ;
for through all the streets have I crawled, the wrestling-rings and the perfumers' shops, to the market, too, and in the shambles, the school for exercise, and the Forum, the doctors' shops, the barbers' shops, and among all the sacred buildings.
I'm wearied out with seek­ ing him, and yet I nowhere meet with Naucrates.
Now I'll go home, and from my wife will I continue to make enquiry into this matter, who the person was, by the side of whom she submitted her body to dishonor.
For it were better that I was dead, than that I this day should leave this enquiry in­ complete.
(Goes up to the door.)
But the house is closed.
A pretty thing indeed!
This is done just like the other things have been done:
I'll knock at the door.
(Knocks.)
Open this door;
ho there!
is there anybody here?
Is any one going to open this door ?
MERC.
Who's that at the door ?
AMPH.
'Tis I.MERC.
Who's “ 'tis I ?" AMPH.
'Tis I that say so.
MERC.
For sure, Jupiter and all the Deities are angered with you who are banging at the door this way.
AMPH.
In what manner?
MERC.
In this manner, that without a doubt you must be spending a wretched life.
AMPH.
Sosia.
MERC.
Well;
I'm Sosia, unless you think that I've forgotten myself.
What do you want now ?
AMPH.
What, you rascal, and do you even ask me that, what it is I want ?
MERC.
I do so ask you;
you blockhead, you've almost broken the hinges from off the door.
Did you fancy that doors were supplied us at the public charge ?
Why are you looking up at me, you stupid ?
What do you want now for yourself, or what fellow are you ?
AMPH.
You whip-scoundrel, do you even ask me who I am, you hell of elm-saplings1?
I'faith, this day I'll make, you burn with smarts of the scourge for these speeches of yours.
MERC.
You surely must have formerly been a spendthrift in your young days.
AMPH.
How so ?
MERC.
Because in your old age you come begging a hap-ill2 of me for yourself.
AMPH.
Slave!
for your own torture do you give vent to these expressions this day.
MERC.
Now I'm performing a sacrifice to you.
AMPH.
How?
MERC.
Why, because I devote you to ill-luck3 with this libation.
(Throws water on him.) * * *[AMPH.
What, you, devote me4, you villain ?
If the Gods have not this day taken away my usual form, I'll take care that you shall be laden with bull's hide thongs, you victim of Saturn1.
So surely will I devote you to the cross and to torture.
Come out of doors, you whip-knave.
MERC.
You shadowy ghost—you, frighten me with your threats?
If you don't betake yourself off from here this!
instant, if you knock once more, if the door makes a noise with your little finger even, I'll break your head with this tile, so that with your teeth you may sputter out your tongue.
AMPH.
What, rascal, would you be for driving me away from my own house ?
What, would you hinder me from knocking at my own door?
I'll this instant tear it from off all its hinges.
MERC.
Do you persist ?
AMPH.
I do persist.
MERC.
Take that, then.
(Throws a tile at him.)AMPH.
Scoundrel!
at your master ?
If I lay hands upon you this day, I'll bring you to that pitch of misery, that you shall be miserable for evermore.
MERC.
Surely, you must have been playing the Bacchanal2, old gentleman.
AMPH.
Why so ?
MERC.
Inasmuch as you take me to be your slave.
AMPH.
What ?
I—take you ?
MERC.
Plague upon you!
I know no master but Amphitryon.AMPH. (to himself).
Have I lost my form ?
It's strange that Sosia shouldn't know me.
I'll make trial.
(Calling out).
How now!
Tell me who I appear to be?
Am I not really Amphitryon ?
MERC.
Amphitryon ?
Are you in your senses ?
Has it not been told you before, old fellow, that you have been playing the Bacchanal, to be asking another person who you are ?
Get away, I recommend you, don't be troublesome while Amphitryon, who has just come back from the enemy, is indulging himself with the company of his wife.
AMPH.
What wife ?
MERC.
Alcmena.
AMPH.
What man ?
MERC.
How often do you want it told ?
Amphitryon, my master;
—don't be troublesome.
AMPH.
Who's he sleeping with ?
MERC.
Take care that you don't meet with some mishap in trifling with me this way.
AMPH.
Prithee, do tell me, my dear Sosia.
MERC.
More civilly said—with Alcmena.
AMPH.
In the same chamber ?
MERC.
Yes, as I fancy, he is sleeping with her side by side.
AMPH.
Alas !-wretch that I am !MERC. (to the AUDIENCE).
It really is a gain which he ima­ gines to be a misfortune.
For to lend one's wife to another is just as though you were to let out barren land to be ploughed.
AMPH.
Sosia!
MERC.
What, the plague, about Sosia ?
AMPH.
Don't you know me, you whip-scoundrel ?
MERC.
I know that you are a troublesome fellow, who have no need to go buy1 a lawsuit.
AMPH.
Still once more—am I not your master Amphitryon ?
MERC.
You are Bacchus himself2, and not Amphitryon.
How often do you want to be told ?
Any times more ?
My master Amphitryon, in the same chamber, is holding Alcmena in his embraces.
If you persist, I'll produce him here, and not without your great discomfiture.
AMPH.
I wish him to be fetched.
(Aside.)
I pray that this day, in return for my services, I may not lose house, wife, and household, together with my figure.
MERC.
Well, I'll fetch him ;
but, in the meantime, do you mind about the door, please.
(Aside.)
I suppose that by this he has brought the sacrifice that he was intending, as far as the banquets.
(Aloud.)
If you are troublesome, you shan't escape without my making a sacrifice of you.
(He re­ tires into the house.)AMPH.
Ye Gods, by my trust in you, what madness is distracting my household?
What wondrous things have I seen since I arrived from abroad!
Why, it's true, surely, what was once heard tell of, how that men of Attica were transformed in Arcadia1, and remained as savage wild beasts, and were not ever afterwards known unto their parents.
BLEPH.
What's this, Sosia ?
Great marvels are these that you are telling of.
Do you say that you found another Sosia at home exactly like yourself?
Sos.
I do say so—but, hark you, since I have produced a Sosia, Amphitryon an Amphitryon, how do you know whether you, perchance, may not be producing another Blepharo ?
0 that the Gods would grant that you as well, belaboured with fists, and with your teeth knocked out, going without your breakfast, might credit this.
For I, that other Sosia, that is to say, who am yonder, has mauled me in a dreadful manner.
BLEPH.
Really, it is wonderful;
but it's as well to mend our pace;
for, as I perceive, Amphitryon is waiting for us, and my empty stomach is grumbling.
AMPH. (apart).
And why do I mention foreign legends ?
More wondrous things they relate to have happened among our Theban race2 in former days ;
that mighty searcher for Eu­ ropa, attacking the monster sprung from Mars, suddenly produced his enemies from the serpent-seed;
and in that battle fought, brother pressed on brother with lance and helm ;
the Epirote land, too, beheld the author of our race, together with the daughter of Venus3, gliding as serpents.
From on high supreme
Jove thus willed it;
thus destiny directs.
All the noblest of our country, in return for their bright achievements, are pursued with direful woes.
This fatality is pressing hard on me—still I could endure disasters so great, and submit to woes hardly to be endured-
Sos. Blepbaro.
BLEPH.
What's the matter ?
Sos.
I don't know;
I suspect something wrong.
BLEPH.
Why ?
Sos. Look, please, our master, like an humble courtierl, is walking before the door bolted fast.
BLEPH.
It's nothing;
walking to and fro, he's looking for an appetite2.
Sos.
After a singular fashion, indeed;
for he has shut the door, that it mayn't escape out of the house.
BLEPH.
You do go yelping on.
Sos.
I go neither yelping on nor barking on;
if you listen to me, observe him.
I don't know why he's by himself alone;
he's making some calcula­ tion, I suppose.
I can hear from this spot what he says­ don't be in a hurry.
AMPH. (apart).
How much I fear lest the Gods should blot out the glory I have acquired in the conquest of the foe.
In wondrous manner do I see the whole of my household in com­ motion.
And then my wife, so full of viciousness, inconti­ nence, and dishonor, kills me outright.
But about the goblet, it is a singular thing;
yet the seal was properly affixed.
And what besides ?
She recounted to me the battles I had fought;
Pterelas, too, besieged and bravely slain by my own hand.
Aye, aye-now I know the trick;
this was done by Sosia's contrivance, who as well has disgracefully presumed to-day to get before me on my arrival.
Sos. (to BLEPHARO).
He's talking about me, and in terms that I had rather not.
Prithee, don't let's accost this man until he has disclosed his wrath.
BLEPH.
Just as you please.
AMPH. (apart).
If it is granted me this day to lay hold of that whip-scoundrel, I'll show him what it is to deceive his master, and to assail me with threats and tricks.
Sos.
Do you hear him?
BLEPH.
I hear him.
Sos.
That implement (pointing to AMPHITRYON'S walking- stick) is a burden for my shoulder-blades.
Let's accost the man, if you please.
Do you know what is in the habit of being commonly said ?
BLEPH.
What you are going to say, I don't know;
what you'll have to endure I pretty well guess.
Sos.
It's an old adage—“ Hunger and delay summon angel to the nostrilsl."
BLEPH.
Aye, and well suited to the occasion.
Let's ad­ dress him directly—Amphitryon!
AMPH. (looking round).
Is it Blepharo I hear ?
It's strange why he's come to me.
Still, he presents himself opportunely, for me to prove the guilty conduct of my wife.
Why have you come here to me, Blepharo ?
BLEPH.
Have you so soon forgotten how early in the morning you sent Sosia to the ship, that I might take a re­ past with you to-day ?
AMPH.
Never in this world was it done.
But where is that scoundrel ?
BELPH.
Who ?
AMPH.
Sosia.
BLEPH.
See, there he is.
(Points at him.)AMPH. (looking about).
Where ?
BLEPH.
Before your eyes;
don't you see him ?
AMPH.
I can hardly see for anger, so distracted has that fellow made me this day.
You shall never escape my making a sacrifice of you.
(Offers to strike SOSIA, on which BLE­ PHARO prevents him.)
Do let me, Blepharo.
BLEPH.
Listen, I pray.
AMPH.
Say on, I'm listening- (gives a blow to SOSIA) you take that.
Sos.
For what reason ?
Am I not in good time ?
I couldn't have gone quicker, if I had betaken myself on the oar- like wings2 of Dædalus.
(AMPHITRYON tries to strike him again.)BLEPH.
Prithee, do leave him alone;
we couldn't quicken our pace any further.
AMPH.
Whether it was the pace of a man on stilts or that of the tortoise, I'm determined to be the death of this villain.
(Striking him at each sentence.)
Take that for the roof;
that for the tiles;
that for closing the door;
that for making fun of your master;
that for your abusive language.
BLEPH.
What injury has he been doing to you ?
AMPH.
Do you ask ?
Shut out of doors, from that house­ top (pointing to it) he has driven me away from my house.
Sos.
What, I ?
AMPH.
What did you threaten that you would do if I knocked at that door ?
Do you deny it, you scoundrel ?
Sos.
Why shouldn't I deny it ?
See, he's sufficiently a wit­ ness with whom I have just now come;
I was sent*on purpose that by your invitation I might bring him to your house.
AMPH.
Who sent you, villain?
Sos.
He who asks me the question.
AMPH.
When, of all things ?
Sos.
Some little time since-not long since—-just now.
When you were reconciled at home to your wife.
AMPH.
Bacchus must have demented you.
Sos.
May I not be paying my respects to Bacchus this day, nor yet to Ceres1.
You ordered the vessels to be made clean, that you might perform a sacrifice, and you sent me to fetch him (pointing to BLEPHARO), that he might breaks fast with you.
AMPH.
Blepharo, may I perish outright if I have either been in the house, or if I have sent him.
(To SOSIA.)
Tell me-where did you leave me ?
Sos.
At home, with your wife Alcmena.
Leaving you, I flew towards the harbour, and invited him in your name.
We are come, and I've not seen you since till now.
AMPH.
Villanous fellow!
With my wife, say you?
You shall never go away without getting a beating.
(Gives him a blow.)Sos. (crying out).
Blepharo!
BLEPH.
Amphitryon, do let him alone, for my sake, and listen to me.
AMPH.
Well then, I'll let him alone.
What do you want ?
Say on.
BLEPH.
He has just now been telling me most extraordi nary marvels.
A juggler, or a sorcerer, perhaps, has en- chanted all this household of yours.
Do enquire in other quarters, and examine how it is.
And don't cause this poor fellow to be tortured, before you understand the matter.
AMPH.
You give good advice;
let's go in, I want you also to be my advocate against my wife.
(Knocks at the door.)JUP.
Who with such weighty blows has been shaking this door on all the hinges ?
Who has been making such a great disturbance for this long while before the house ?
If I find him out, I'll sacrifice him to the shades of the Teleboans.
There's nothing, as the common saying is, that goes on well with me to-day.
I left Blepharo and Sosia that I might find my kinsman Naucrates ;
him I have not found, and them I have lost.
But I espy them;
I'll go meet them, to enquire if they have any news.
Sos.
Blepharo, that's our master that's coming out of the house;
but this man's the sorcerer.
BLEPH. 0 Jupiter!
What do I behold ?
This is not, but that is, Amphitryon ;
if this is, why really that cannot be he, unless, indeed, he is double.
JUP.
See now, here's Sosia with Blepharo ;
I'll accost them the first.
Well, Sosia, come to us at last P I'm quite hungry.
Sos. Didn't I tell you, Blepharo, that this one was the sorcerer ?
AMPH.
Nay, Theban citizens, I say that this is he (point­ ing to JUPITER) who in my house has made my wife guilty of incontinence, through whom I find a store of unchastity laid up for me.
Sos. (to JUPITER).
Master, if now you are hungry, crammed full of fisticuffs, I betake me to you.
AMPH.
Do you persist, whip-scoundrel ?
AMPH.
What, I a sorcerer ?
(Strikes him.)
Take that.
JUP.
What madness possesses you, stranger, for you to be beating my servant ?
AMPH.
Your servant ?
JUP.
Mine.
AMPH.
You lie.
JUP.
Sosia, go in-doors, and take care the breakfast is got ready while I'm sacrificing this fellow.
Sos. I'll go. (Aside.)
Amphitryon, I suppose, will receive the other Amphitryon as courteously as I, that other Sosia, did me, Sosia, a while ago.
Meantime, while they are con­ tending, I'll turn aside into the victualling department1:
I'll clean out all the dishes, and all the vessels I'll drain.
( Goes into the house.)
JUP.
Do you say that I lie ?
AMPH.
You lie, I say, you corrupter of my family.
JUP.
For that disgraceful speech, I'll drag you along here, seizing you by the throat.
(Seizes him by the throat.)AMPH.
Ah wretched me!
JUP.
But you should have had a care of this beforehand.
AMPH.
Blepharo, aid me!
BLEPH. (aside).
The two are so exactly alike that I don't know which to side with.
Still, so far as possible, I'll put an end to their contention.
(Aloud.)
Amphitryon, don't slay Amphitryon in fight;
let go his throat, I pray.
JUP.
Are you calling this fellow Amphitryon ?
BLEPH.
Why not ?
Formerly he was but one, but now he has become double.
While you are wanting to be he, the other, too, doesn't cease to be of his form.
Meanwhile, prithee, do leave go of his neck.
JUP.
I will leave go.
(Lets go of AMPHITRYON.)
But tell me, does that fellow appear to you to be Amphitryon ?
BLEPH.
Really, both of you do.
AMPH.
0 supreme Jupiter !
when this day didst thou take from me my form ?
I'll proceed to make enquiry of him;
are you Amphitryon ?
JUP.
Do you deny it ?
AMPH.
Downright do I deny it, inasmuch as in Thebes there is no other Amphitryon besides myself.
JUP.
On the contrary, no other besides myself;
and, in fact, do you, Blepharo, be the judge.
BLEPH.
I'll make this matter clear by proofs, if I can.
(To AMPHITRYON.)
Do you answer first.
AMPH.
With pleasure.
BLEPH.
Before the battle with the Taphians was begun by you, what orders did you give me ?
AMPH.
The ship being in readiness, for you carefully to keep close to the rudder.
JUP.
That if our people should take to flight, 1 might betake myself in safety thither.
BLEPH.
Anything else as well?
AMPH.
That the bag loaded with treasure should be carefully guarded.
JUP.
Because the moneyBLEPH.
Hold your tongue, you, if you please;
it's my place to ask.
Did you know the amount ?
JUP.
Fifty Attic talents.
BLEPH.
He tells the truth to a nicety.
And you (to AM­ PHITRYON), how many Philippeans ?
AMPH.
Two thousand.
JUP.
And obols1 twice as many.
BLEPH.
Each of you states the matter correctly.
Inside the bag one of you must have been shut up.
JUP.
Attend, please.
With this right hand, as you know, I slew king Pterelas;
his spoils I seized, and the goblet from which he had been used to drink I brought away in a casket;
I made a present of it to my wife, with whom this day at home I bathed, I sacrificed, and slept.
AMPH.
Ah me !
what do I hear ?
I scarcely am myself.
For, awake, I am asleep;
awake, I am in a dream ;
alive and well, I come to destruction.
I am that same Amphitryon, the descendant of2 Gorgophone, the general of the Thebans, and the sole combatant for Creon against the Teleboans;
I, who have subdued by my might the Acarnanians and the Taphians, and, by my consummate warlike prowess, their king.
Over these have I appointed Cephalus, the son of the great Deioneus.
JUP.
I am he who by warfare and my valour crushed the hostile ravagers.
They had destroyed Electryon and the brothers of my wife.
Wandering through the Ionian, the Ægean, and the Cretan seas, with piratical violence they laid waste Achaia, Ætolia, and Phocis.
AMPH.
Immortal Gods!
I cannot trust my own self.
so exactly does he relate all the things that happened there.
Consider, Blepharo.
BLEPH.
One thing only remains;
if so it is, do you be Am­ phitryons both of you.
JuP.
I knew what you would say.
The scar that I have on the muscle of my right arm, from the wound which Pte­ relas gave meBLEPH.
Well, that.
AMPH.
Quite to the purpose.
JUP.
See you!
look, behold!
BLEPH.
Uncover, and I'll look.
JUP.
We have uncovered.
Look!
(They show their naked arms.)BLEPH.
(looking at the right arm of each).
Supreme Jupi­ ter, what do I behold ?
On the right-arm muscle of each, in the same spot, the scar clearly appears with the same mark, reddish and somewhat livid, just as it has first commenced to close.
Reasoning is at a standstill, all judgment is struck dumb;
I don't know what to do1.]
BLEPH.
Do you settle these matters between yourselves ;
I'm off, for I have business ;
and I do not think that I have ever anywhere beheld such extraordinary wonders.
AMPH.
Blepharo, I pray that you'll stay as my advocate, and not go away.
BLEPH.
Farewell.
What need is there of me for an advo­ cate, who don't know which of the two to side with ?
JUP.
I'm going hence in-doors:
Alcmena is in labour.
(Exit BLEPHARO, and JUPITER goes into AMPHITRYON'S house.)AMPH. (aloud to himself).
I'm undone, wretch that I am ;
for what am I to do, when my advocates and friends are now forsaking me ?
Never, by heavens, shall he deride me unre­ venged, whoever he is.
Now will I betake myself straight to the king, and tell him of the matter as it has happened.
Bv my faith, I will this day take vengeance on this Thessahan sorcerer, who has wrongfully distracted the minds of my household.
But where is he ?
(Looking around.)
By my troth, he's off into the house, to my wife, I suppose.
What other person lives in Thebes more wretched than myself ?
What now shall I do ?
I, whom all men deny and deride just as they please.
I am resolved;
I'll burst into the house;
there, whatever person I perceive, whether maid-servant or man-servant, whether wife or whether paramour, whether father or whether grandfather, I'll behead that person in the house;
neither Jupiter nor all the Deities shall hinder me from this, even if they would, but that I'll do just as I have resolved.
(As he advances to the door, it thunders, and he falls in a swoon upon the ground.)BROM. (to herself).
The hopes and resources of my life lie buried in my breast, nor is there any boldness in my heart, but what I have lost it.
So much to me do all things seem, the sea, the earth, the heavens, to be conspiring, that now I may be crushed, that I'may be destroyed.
Ah, wretched me!
I know not what to do.
Prodigies so great have come to pass within the house.
Ah!
woe is me!
I'm sick at heart, some water I could wish!
I'm overpowered and I'm utterly undone.
My head is aching, and I cannot hear, nor do I see well with my eyes
No woman is there more wretched than myself, nor can one seem to be more so.
Thus has it this day befallen my mistress;
for when she invoked for herself the Deities of travail, what rumblings and grumblings1, crashes and flashes;
suddenly, how instantaneously did it thunder, and how woundy loud.
On the spot where each one stood, at the peal he fell;
then some one, I know not who, exclaimed in a mighty voice," Alcmena, succour is at hand, fear not:
propitious both to thee and thine, the Ruler of the Heavens comes.
Arise," it said, "ye who have fallen down in your terror through dread of me."
As I lay, I arose;
I fancied that the house was in flames.
Then Alcmena called me ;
and then did that circumstance strike me with horror.
Fears for my mistress took possession of me;
I ran to her to enquire what she wanted;
and then I beheld that she had given birth to two male children ;
nor yet did any one of us perceive when she was delivered, or indeed expect it.
(Sees AMPHITRYON.)
But what's this?
Who's this old man that's lying thus before our house ?
Has Jupiter then smitten him with his thunders ?
By my troth, I think so ;
for, oh Jupiter!
he is in a lethargy just like one dead.
I'll approach, that I may learn who it is.
(She ad­ vances.)
Surely, this is my master Amphitryon.
(Calls aloud.)
Ho / Amphitryon!
AMPH.
I'm dead.
BROM.
Arise.
AMPH.
I'm slain outright.
BROM.
Give me your hand.
( Takes his hand.)AMPH. (recovering).
Who is it that has hold of me PBROM.
Bromia, your maid-servant.
AMPH. (rising).
I tremble all over, to such a degree has Jove pealed against me.
And no otherwise is it than if I had come hither from Acheron.
But why have you come out of the house ?
BROM.
The same alarm has scared ourselves, affrighted with horror;
in the house where you yourself dwell, have I seen astounding prodigies.
Woe to me, Amphitryon;
even now do my senses fail me to such a degree.
AMPH.
Come now, tell me;
do you know me to be your master Amphitryon ?
BROM.
I do know it.
AMPH.
Look even once again.
BROM.
I do know it.
AMPH.
She alone of all my household has a sane mind.
BROM.
Nay but, really, they are all of them sane.
AMPH.
But my wife causes me to be insane by her own shameful practices.
BROM.
But I'll make you, Amphitryon, to be holding other language;
that you may understand that your wife is dutiful and chaste, upon that subject I will in a few words discover some tokens and some proofs.
In the first place of all, Alc­ mena has given birth to two sons.
AMPH.
Two, say you ?
BROM.
Two.
AMPH.
The Gods preserve me!
BROM.
Allow me to speak, that you may know that all the Deities are propitious to yourself and to your wife.
AMPH.
Say on.
BROM.
After that, this day, your wife began to be in labour, when the pangs of childbirth came or, as is the custom with women in travail, she invoked the im­ mortal Gods to give her aid, with washed hands1 and with covered head.
Then forthwith it thundered with most tre­ mendous crash.
At first we thought that your house was falling ;
all your house shone bright, as though it had been made of gold.
AMPH.
Prithee, relieve me quickly from this, since you have kept me long enough in suspense.
What happened then ?
BROM.
While these things were passing, meanwhile, not one of us heard your wife groaning or complaining;
and thus, in fact, without pain was she delivered.
AMPH.
Then do I rejoice at this, whatever she has merited at my hands.
BROM.
Leave that alone, and hear these things which I shall tell you.
After she was delivered, she bade us wash the babes;
we commenced to do so.
But that child which I washed, how stout, how very powerful he is;
and not a person was there, able to wrap him in the swaddling-clothes.
AMPH.
Most wondrous things you tell of.
If these things are true, I do not apprehend but that succour has been brought to my wife from heaven.
BROM.
Now shall I make you own to things more won­ drous still.
After he was laid in the cradle, two immense crested serpents glided down through the skylight;
instantly they both reared their heads.
AMPH.
Ah me!
BROM.
Be not dismayed—but the ser­ pents began to gaze upon all around.
After they beheld the children, quickly they made towards the cradle;
I, fearing for the children, alarmed for myself, going backwards, began to draw and pull the cradle to and fro, and so much the more fiercely did the serpents pursue.
After that one of the children caught sight of the serpents, he quickly leapt from the cradle, straightway he made an attack upon them, ana suddenly he grasped them, one in each hand.
AMPH.
You tell of wondrous things;
a very fearful exploit do you relate;
for at your words horror steals upon the limbs of wretched me.
What happened then ?
Say on.
BROM.
The child slew both the serpents.
While these things are passing, in a loud voice there calls upon your wifeAMPH.
What person?
BROM.
Jupiter, the supreme Ruler of Gods and men.
He said that he had secretly enjoyed Alcmena in his embraces, and that he was his own son who had overcome those serpents;
the other, he said, was your child.
AMPH.
By my troth, I am not sorry if I am allowed to take my half of a blessing in partnership with Jupiter.
Go home, and bid the sacred vessels to be at once prepared for me, that with many victims I may seek my peace with supreme Jove.
I will apply to Tiresiasl the soothsayer, and consult him what he considers ought to be done;
at the same time I'll relate to him this matter just as it has happened.
(It thunders.)
But what means this ?
How dreadfully it thunders!
Ye Gods, your mercy, I do entreat.
JuP.
Be of good cheer, Amphitryon;
I am come to thy aid:
thou hast nothing to fear;
all diviners and soothsayers let alone.
What is to be, and what has past, I will tell thee;
and so much better than they can, inasmuch as I am Jupiter.
First of all, I have made loan of the person of Alc­ mena, and have caused her to be pregnant with a son.
Thou, too, didst cause her to be pregnant, when thou didst set out upon the expedition;
at one birth has she brought forth the two together.
One of these, the one that is sprung from my parentage, shall bless thee2 with deathless glory by his deeds.
Do thou return with Alcmena to your former affection;
she merits not that thou shouldst impute it to her as her blame;
by my power has she been compelled thus to act.
I now return to the heavens.
(-He ascends.)AMPH.
I'll do as thou dost command me;
and I entreat thee to keep thy promises.
I'll go in-doors to my wife.
I dismiss the aged Tiresias from my thoughts.
Spectators, now, for the sake of supreme Jove1, give loud applause.

Scene.—Near Cyrene, in Africa;
not far from the sea-shore, and before the cottage of DAEMONES and tho Temple of Venus, whicl has, probably, a small court before it, surrounded with a low walLDÆMONES, an aged Athenian, having lost his property goes to live in retrirement near the sea-shore of Cyrene, in the vicinity of the Temple of Venus.
It so happens that Labrax, a Procurer, makes purchase of two damsels, Palæstra and Ampelisca, and comes to reside at Cyrene.
Plesidippus, a young Athenian, sees Palæstra there, and falls in love with her;
and making an arrangement with the Procurer, gives him a sum in part payment for her, on which occa­ sion, Labrax invites him to a sacrifice in the Temple of Venus.
A Sicilian guest of his, however, named Charmides, persuades him to carry the young women over to Sicily, where he is sure to make a greater profit by them.
On this, the Procurer, accompanied by his guest, sets sail with them.
A tem­ pest arises, and they are shipwrecked.
The young women escape in a boat, and arriving ashore, are hospitably received by the Priestess of Venus.
Labrax and Charmides also escape, and on discovering where the women are, the former attempts to drag them by force from the Temple.
On this they are protected by Dæmones and Plesidippus, who, through Trachalio, finds out where they are.
In the wreck a wallet has been lost, which belongs to Labrax, and in which is a casket enclosing some trinkets belonging to Palæstra.
Gripus, a servant of Dæmones, draws this up with the rope attached to his net;
and by means of these trinkets it is discovered that Palæstra is the daughter of Dæmones, whom he had lost in her infancy;
on which she is given in marriage to Plesidippus by her father, who becomes reconciled to Labrax.
A FISHERMAN draws a wallet out of the sea in his net (Reti), in which (Ubi) are the trinkets of his master's daughter, who, having been stolen, had come into the possession of a Procurer as her owner (Dominum).
She (Ea), having suffered shipwreck (Naufragio), without knowing it comes under the protec­ tion of her own father;
she is recognized, and is married to her (Suo) lover Plesidippus.
WITH him who sways all nations, seas, and lands, I am a fellow-citizen in the realms of the Gods.
I am, as you see2, a bright and shining star, a Constellation that ever in its season rises here on earth and in the heavens.
Arcturus is my name.
By night, I am glittering in the heavens and amid the Gods, passing among mortals in the day.
Other Constellations, too, descend from the heavens upon the earth ;
Jove, who is the ruler of Gods and men—he disperses us here in various directions among the nations, to observe the actions, manners, piety, and faith of men, just as the means of each avail him.
Those who commence villanous suits at law upon false testimony, and those who, in court, upon false oath deny a debt, their names written down, do we return to Jove.
Each day does he learn who here is calling for vengeance.
Whatever wicked men seek here to gain their cause through perjury, who succeed before the judge in their unjust de­ mands, the same case adjudged does he judge over again, and he fines them in a penalty much greater than the results of the judgment they have gained.
The good men written down on other tabletsl does he keep.
And still these wicked persons entertain a notion of theirs, that they are able to appease Jupiter with gifts, with sacrifice ;
both their labour and their cost they lose.
This, for this reason, is so, because no petition of the perjured is acceptable to Him.
If any person that is supplicating the Deities is pious, he will more easily procure pardon for himself than he that is wicked.
Therefore I do advise you this, you who are good and who pass your lives in piety and in virtue-still persevere, that one day you may rejoice that so you did.
Now, the reason for which I've come hither, I will disclose to you.
First, then, Diphilus2 has willed the name of this city to be Cyrene3.
There (pointing to the cottage) dwells Dæmones, in the country and in a cottage very close adjoining to the sea, an old gentleman who has come hither in exile from Athens, no unworthy man.
And still, not for his bad deserts has he left his country, but while he was aiding others, meanwhile himself he embarrassed:
a property honorably acquired he lost by his kindly ways.
Long since, his daughter, then a little child, was lost;
a most villanous fellow bought her of the thief, and this Procurer brought the maiden hither to Cyrene.
A certain Athenian youth, a citizen of this city, beheld her as she was going home from the music-school.
He begins to love her;
to the Procurer he comes;
he purchases the damsel for himself at the price of thirty minæ, and gives him earnest, and binds the Procurer with an oath.
This Procurer, just as befitted hini, did not value at one straw his word, or what, on oath, he had said to the young man.
He had a guest, a fit match for himself, an old man of Sicily, a rascal from Agrigentum1, a traitor to his native city;
this fellow began to extol the beauty of that maiden, and of the other damsels, too, that were be­ longing to him.
On this he began to persuade the Procurer to go together with himself to Sicily;
he said that there the men were given to pleasure;
that there he might be enabled to become a wealthy man;
that there was, the greatest profit from courtesans.
He prevails.
A ship is hired by stealth.
Whatever he has, by night the Procurer carries it on board ship from his house;
the young man who purchased the dam­ sel of him he has told that he is desirous of performing a vow to Venus.
This is the Temple of Venus, here (pointing at it), and here, for that reason, has he invited the youth hither to a breakfast2.
From there at once did he embark on board ship, and he carried off the courtesans.
Some other persons informed the young man what things were going on, how that the Procurer had departed.
When the young man came to the harbour, their ship had got a great way out to sea.
When I beheld how that the maiden was being carried off, I brought at the same instant both relief to her and destruction to the Procurer;
the storm I rebuked, and the waves of the sea I aroused.
For the most violent Constellation of them all am I, Arcturus;
turbulent I am when rising, when I set, more tur­ bulent still.
Now, cast ashore there, both the Procurer and his guest are sitting upon a rock ;
their ship is dashed to pieces.
But this maiden, and another as well, her attendant, affrighted, have leaped from the ship into a boat.
At this moment the waves are bringing them from the rocks to land, to the cot­ tage of this old man, who is living here in exile, whose roof and tiles the storm has stript off.
And this is his servant who is coming out of doors.
The youth will be here just now, and you shall see him, who purchased the maiden of the Procurer.
Now, fare ye well, and may your foes1 dis­ trust themselves.
(Exit.SeEr. (to himself).
0 ye immortal Gods, what a dreadful tempest has Neptune sent us this last night!
The storm has unroofed the cottage.
What need of words is there ?
It was no storm, but what Alcmena met with in Euripides3;
it has so knocked all the tiles from off the roof;
more light has it given us, and has added to our windows.
PLES.
I have both withdrawn you from your avocations, and that has not succeeded on account of which I've brought you;
I could not catch the Procurer down at the harbour.
But I have been unwilling to abandon all hope by reason of my remissness;
on that account, my friends, have I the longer detained you.
Now hither to the Temple of Venus aIr.
I come to see, where he was saying that he was about to perform a sacrifice.
SCEP.
(aloud to himself, at a distance).
If 1 am wise, I shall be getting ready this clay that is awaiting me.
(Falls to work digging.)PLES. (looking round).
Some one, I know not who, is speaking near to me.
SCEP.
Who's calling me by name ?
DÆM.
He who paid his money for you.
SCEP. (turning round).
As though you would say, Dæ­ mones, that I am your slave,DÆM.
There's occasion for plenty of clay1, therefore dig up plenty of earth.
I find that the whole of my cottage must be covered;
for now it's shining through it, more full of holes than a sieve.
PLES. (advancing).
Health to you, good father, and to both of you, indeed.
DÆM. Health to you.
SCEP. (to PLESIDIPPUS, who is muffled up in a coat).
But whether are you male or female, who are calling him father ?
PLES.
Why really, I'm a man.
DÆM.
Then, man, go seek a father elsewhere.
I once had an only daughter, that only one I lost.
Of the male sex I never had a child.
PLES.
But the Gods will giveSCEP.
(going on digging).
A heavy mischance to you indeed, i' faith, whoever you are, who are occupying us, already occu­ pied, with your prating.
PLES. (pointing to the cottage).
Pray are you dwelling there ?
SCEP.
Why do you ask that ?
Are you reconnoitring the place for you to come and rob there ?
PLES.
It befits a slave to be right rich in his savings, whom, in the presence of his master, the conversation cannot escape, or who is to speak rudely to a free man.
SCEP.
And it befits a man to be shameless and impu­ dent, for him to whom there's nothing owing, of his own accord to come to the house of another person annoying people.
DÆM.
Sceparnio, hold your tongue.
(To PLESIDIPPUS.)
What do you want, young man ?
PLEa.
A mishap to that fellow, who is in a hurry to be the first to speak when his master's present.
But, unless it's troublesome, I wish to make enquiry of you in a few words.
DÆM.
My attention shall be given you, even though in the midst of business.
SCEP. (to PLESIDIPPUS).
Rather, be off with you to the marsh, and cut down some reeds1, with which we may cover the cottage, while it is fine weather.
DÆM.
Hold your tongue.
Do you tell me (to PLESIDIPPUS) if you have need of anything.
PLES.
Inform me on what I ask you;
whether you have seen here any frizzle-headed fellow, with grey hair, a worth­ less, perjured, fawning knave.
DÆM.
Full many a one;
for by reason of fellows of that stamp am I living in misery.
PLEa.
Him, I mean, who brought with him to the Temple of Venus here two young women, and who was to make pre­ parations for himself to perform a sacrifice either to-day or yesterday.
DÆM.
By my faith, young man, for these very many days past I haven't seen anyone sacrificing there;
and yet it can't be unknown to me if any one does sacrifice there.
They are always asking here for water, or for fire, or for vessels, or for a knife, or for a spit, or for a pot for cooking2, or something or other.
What need is there of words?
I procured my vessels and my well, for the use of Venus, and not my own.
There has now been a cessation of it for these many days past.
PLES.
According to the words you utter, you tell me I'm undone.
DÆM.
Really, so far as I'm concerned, i' faith, you may be safe and sound.
SCEP. (stopping in his digging).
Hark you, you that are roaming about Temples for the sake of your stomach, 'twere better for you to order a breakfast to be got ready at home.
Perhaps you've been invited here1 to breakfast.
He that invited you, hasn't he come at all ?
PLES.
'Tis the fact.
SCEP.
There's no risk then in your betaking yourself hence home without your breakfast.
It's better for you to be a waiter upon Ceres than upon Venus;
the latter attends to love, Ceres attends to wheat.
PLES. (to DÆMONES).
This fellow has been making sport of me in a digraceful manner.
DÆM.
(looking out at the side).
0 ye immortal Gods, Sce­ parnio, what means those people near the sea-shore ?
SCEP.
According to my notion, they've been invited to a parting breakfast2.DÆM.
How so?
SeEp.
Why, because, after dinner, I fancy, they yesterday washed themselves clean;
their ship has gone to pieces out at sea.
DÆM. (looking steadfastly).
Such is the fact.
SCEP.
But, i' faith, on dry land our cottage and tiles have done the same.
DÆM.
Oh dear!
what unfortunate creatures you are;
(tc SCEPARNIO) how the shipwrecked people are swimming.
PLES.
Prithee, where are these people ?DÆM. (pointing to the distance).
This way, to the right;
don't you see them near the shore ?
PLES. (looking the same way).
I see them;
(to his FRIENDS) follow me.
I only wish it may be he that I'm seeking, that most accursed fellow.
(To DÆMONES and SCEPARNIO.)
Fare you well.
SeEp.
If you hadn't put us in mind, we should have thought of that ourselves.
(-Exeunt PLESIDIPPUS and FRIENDS.
SCEP.
(looking out towards the sea).
But, 0 Palæmon1, hallowed associate of Neptune, who art said to be the partner of Hercules, what shocking thing do I see ?
DÆM.
What do you see ?
SCEP.
I see two young women sitting in a boat alone.
How the poor things are being tossed about!
That's good, that's good, well done.
The surge is driving the boat away from the rock towards the shore.
Not a pilot could have ever done it better.
I don't think that I ever saw billows more huge.
They are saved, if they can escape those waves.
Now, now's the danger;
it has sent one overboard!
See you that one whom the waves have thrown out of the boat ?
Still, she's in a shallow place;
she'll easily wade through it now.
0 capital!
now she's safe;
she has escaped from the water;
she's now on shore.
But that other one has now sprung towards the land from the boat-from her alarm she has fallen into the waves upon her knees.
She has got up again;
if she takes this direction, the matter's safe;
(a pause) but she has taken to the right, to utter destruction.
Ah, she will be wandering all the dayDÆM.
What signifies that to you ?
SeEr.
If she should fall down from that rock towards which she is wending her way, she'll be putting a period to her wandering.
DÆM.
If you are about to dine this evening at their ex­ pense, I think you may then be concerned for them, Sceparnio ;
if you are going to eat at my house, I wish your services to be devoted to myself.
SCEP.
You ask what's good and proper.
DÆM.
Then follow me this way.
SCEP.
I follow2. (Exeunt.PAL. (to herself).
By heavens, the mishaps of mortals are spoken of as much less bitter than ** * * * * * the sharp pangs that are inflicted in the experience of them * * * * Has this then pleased the Deity, that I, clad in this guise, should, in my terror, be cast pon a spot unknown ?
Shall I then declare that I have been born to this wretched lot ?
Do I receive this meed in return for my exemplary piety ?
For to me it would not prove a hardship to endure this laborious lot, if I had conducted myself undutifully towards my parents or the Gods;
but if studiously I have exerted myself to beware of that, then, unduly and unjustly, Deities, you send upon me this.
For what henceforth shall the glaringly impious receive, if after this fashion you pay honor to the guiltless ?
But if I knew that I or my parents had done anything wicked, now should I have grieved the less.
But the wickedness of this master of mine is pressing hard upon me, his impiety is causing my woes;
everything has he lost in the sea;
these are the remains (looking at her dress) of his property.
Even she, who was carried together with me in the boat, was washed out by the violence of the waves;
I am now alone.
If she at least1 had been saved for me, through her aid my affliction here would have been lighter to me.
Now, what hope or aid or what counsel shall I receive, a spot so lonesome here have I lighted upon alone ?
Here are the rocks, here roars the sea, and not one individual comes across my path.
This dress that I am clothed in forms all my riches quite entirely;
nor know I with what food or roof I am to be provided.
What hope have I through which to desire to live ?
Neither am I acquainted with the place, nor was I ever here before.
At least I could have wished for some one who would point out to me either a road or a path from these spots;
so much am I now at a loss for ad­ vice whether to go this way or that;
neither, indeed, do I see2 anywhere near here a cultivated spot.
Cold, distraction, and alarm, have taken possession of all my limbs.
My parents, you know not of this, that I am now thus wretched;
I that was born a woman entirely free, was so to no purpose.
Am I at all the less in servitude now, than if I had been born a slave ?
And never in any way has it been a profit to those who for their own sakes reared me up.
(She advances for­ ward, and rests on one side against the cliff?)AMP. (to herself).
What is there better for me, what more to my advantage, than to shut out life from my body ?
Sa. wretched am I in my existence, and so many deadening cares are there in my breast;
so despicable is my lot;
I care not for my life;
I have lost the hope with which I used to comfort myself.
All places have I now rambled about, and through each covert spot have I crawled along, to seek my fellow-slave with voice, eyes, ears, that I might trace her out.
And still I find her nowhere, nor have I yet determined whither to go, nor where to seek her, nor, in the meantime, do I find any person here to give me an answer, of whom I might make enquiry.
No place, too, is there on earth more solitary than are these spots and this locality.
And yet, if she lives, never while I exist will I cease before I discover her alive.
PAL. (aloud).
Whose voice is it that sounds close by me here ?AMP. (starting).
I am alarmed.
Who's speaking near me ?
PAL.
Prithee, kind Hope, do come to my aid.
AMP.
It's a woman:
a woman's voice reaches my ears.
Will vou not rescue wretched me from this alarm ?
PAL.
Surely a woman's voice reached my ears.
Prithee.
is it Ampelisca PAMP.
Is it you, Palæstra, that I hear ?
PAL.
But why don't I call her by her own name, that sho may hear me ?
( With a loud voice.)
Ampelisca!AMP.
Ha!
who's that ?
PAL.
'Tis I.AMP.
Is it Palæstra ?
PAL.
It is.
AMP.
Tell me where you are.
PAL.
Troth, I'm now in the midst of a multitude of woes.
AMP.
I am your partner;
and no less is my own share than yours.
But I long to see you.
PAL.
In that wish you are my rival.
AMP.
Let's follow our voices with our steps;
where are you ?
PAL.
See, here am I.
Step onward towards me, and come straight on to meet me.
AMP.
I'm doing so with care.
(They meet in front of the stage. )PAL.
Give me your hand.
AMP.
Take it.
PAL.
Are you still alive ?
Prithee, tell me.
AMP.
You, indeed, make me now wish to live, since I'm empowered to touch you.
How hardly can I persuade myself of this, that I am holding you.
Prithee, do embrace me (they embrace), my only hope;
how you are now easing me of all my woes.
PAL.
You are beforehand with me in using expressions which belong to me.
Now it befits us to be going hence.
PAL.
Let's keep along this sea-shore.
(Pointing to the shore.)
AMP.
Wherever you please, I'll follow.
PAL.
Shall we go along thus with our wet clothing ?
AMP.
That which exists, the same must of necessity be borne.
(Looking up at the Temple.)
But, pray, what's this ?
PAL.
What is it?
AMP.
Prithee, don't you see this Temple ?
(Pointing towards it.)PAL.
Where is it ?
AMP.
On the right hand.
PAL.
I seem to be looking at a place becoming the Divini­ ties.
AMP.
There must be people not far hence;
it is so de­ lightful a spot.
Whoever the Godis, I pray him to relieve us from these troubles, and to succour us females, wretched, help­ less, and in distress.
(They advance towards the Temple, and kneel down before it.)PTOL.
Who are these, that in their prayers are soliciting aid from my Patroness ?
For the voice of suppliants has brought me hither out of doors.
They pay suit to a kind and compliant Goddess and a Patroness that makes no difficulties, and one who is verv benevolent.
PAL.
Mother, we bid you hail.
PTOL.
Maidens, hail to you.
But, prithee, whence am I to say that you are hither come with your wet garments, thus wofully arrayed ?
PAL.
Just now, we came from a place there (pointing towards the shore), not a great way from this spot;
but it is a great way off from here, whence we have been brought hither.
PTOL.
Have you been borne, do you mean, by a ship, the wooden steedl, over the azure paths ?
PAL.
Even so.
PTOL.
Then it were more fitting that you should have come arrayed in white and provided with vic­ tims;
it isn't the practice for people to come to this Temple in that fashion.
(Pointing at their dresses.)PAL.
Prithee, whence would you have us, who have been both cast away at sea, to be bringing victims hither ?
Now, in want of assistance, do we embrace your knees, we who are of hopes undefined in places unknown, that you may receive us under your roof and shelter us, and that you will pity the miseries of us both, who have neither any place of refuge nor hope at hand, nor have anything whatever of our own beyond that which you see.
PTOL.
Give me your hands, arise, both of you, from off your knees ;
no one among women is more compassionate than 1.
(They arise from the ground.)
But, maidens, my circumstances are poor and limited;
with difficulty I support my own exist­ ence ;
Venus I serve for my maintenance.
AMP.
Prithee, is this a Temple of Venus ?
PTOL.
I will admit it;
I am styled the Priestess of this Temple.
But whatever it is, it shall be done by me with a hearty welcome, so far as my means shall suffice.
Come with me this way.
PAL.
Kindly and attentively, mother, do you show your attentions to us.
PTOL.
So I ought to do.
(They go into the Temple.)A FISHERMAN.
Persons who are poor live wretchedly in every way, especially those who have no calling and have learned no art.
Of necessity must that be deemed enough, whatever they have at home.
From our garb, then, you pretty well understand how wealthy we are.
These hooks and these rods here are as good to us as a calling and as our clothing.
Each day from the city do we come out hither to the sea to seek for forage.
Instead of exertion in the wrestling-school and the place for exercise, we have this:
sea-urchins, rock­ mussels, oysters, limpets1, cockles, sea-nettles, sea-mussels, and spotted crabs2, we catch.
After that, we commence our fishing with the hook and among the rocks, and thus we take our food from out of the sea.
If success does not befall us, and not any fish is taken, soaked in salt waterS and thoroughly drenched, we quietly betake ourselves home, and without dinner go to sleep.
And since the sea is now in waves so boisterous, no hopes have we ;
unless we take some cockles, without a doubt we've had our dinners.
Now let's adore good Venus here, that she may kindly befriend us to-day. ( They advance towards the door of the Temple.)TRACH. (to himself).
I've carefully given all attention that I mightn't pass my master anywhere;
for when some time since he went out of the house, he said that he was going to the harbour, and he ordered me to come here to meet him at the Temple of Venus.
But see, opportunely do I espy some people standing here of whom I may enquire;
I'll accost them.
(Goes up to the EIHERMEN.)
Save you, thieves of the sea, shellfish-gatherers and hook-fishers4, hun­ gry race of men, how fare ye ?
How perish apace5 ? 2 Spotted crabs)—Ver. 298.
It is not known what kind of fish the " plagusia" was.
FISHER.
Just as befits a fisherman with hunger, thirst, and expectation.
TRACH.
Have you seen to-day, while you've been standing here, any young man, of courageous aspect, ruddy, stout, of genteel appearance, come by this way, who was taking with him three men in scarfs, with swords ?
FISHER.
We know of no one coming this way of that ap­ pearance which you mention.
TRACH.
Have you seen any old fellow, bald on the forehead and snub-nosed, of big stature, pot-bellied, with eyebrows awry, a narrow forehead, a knave, the scorn of Gods and men, a scoundrel, one full of vile dishonesty and of iniquity, who had along with him two very pretty-looking young women ?
FISHER.
One who has been born with qualities and endow­ ments of that sort, 'twere really fitter for him to resort to the executioner than to the Temple of Venus.
TRACH.
But tell me if you have seen him.
FISHER.
Really, no one has passed this way.
Fare you well.
TRACH.
Fare ye well.
(Exeunt FISHERMEN.TRACH. (to himself).
I thought so ;
it has come to pass as I suspected;
my master has been deceived;
the cursed Pro­ curer has taken himself off to distant lands.
He has em­ barked on board ship, and carried the women away ;
I'm a wizard.
He invited my master here to breakfast, as well, this very spawn of wickedness.
Now what is better for me than to wait here in this spot until my master comes ?
At the same time, if this Priestess of Venus knows anything more, if I see her, I'll make enquiries ;
she'll give me the in.
formation.
AMP. (to the PRIESTESS, within).
I understand;
here at this cottage (pointing to it), which is close by the Temple of Venus, you've requested me to knock and ask for water.
TRACH.
Whose voice is it that has flown to my ears ?
AMP.
Prithee, who's speaking here ?
Who is it that I see PTRACH.
Isn't this Ampelisca that's coming out from the Temple ?AMP.
Isn't this Trachalio that I see, the servant of Ple­ sidippus ?
TRACH.
It is she.
AMP.
It is he ;
Trachalio, health to you.
AMP.
In misery I pass a life not far advanced1.
TRACH.
Do give some better omen.
AMP.
Still it behoves all prudent persons to confer and talk together.
But, prithee, where'a your master, Plesidippus ?
TRACH.
Marry, well said, indeed;
as if he wasn't within there.
(Pointing to the Temple.)AMP.
By my troth, he isn't, nor, in fact, has he come here at all.
TRACH.
He hasn't come ?
AMP.
You say the truth.
TRACH.
That's not my way, Ampelisca.
But how nearly is the breakfast got ready ?
AMP.
What breakfast, I beg of you ?
TEACH.
The sacrifice, I mean, that you are performing here.
AMP.
Prithee, what is it you are dreaming about ?
TRACH.
For certain, Labrax invited Plesidippus hither to a breakfast, your master, my master.
AMP.
By my troth, you're telling of no wondrous facts :
if he has deceived Gods and men, he has only acted after the fashion of Procurers.
TRACH.
Then neither yourselves nor my master are here performing a sacrifice.
AMP.
You are a wizard.
TRACH.
What are you doing then ?
AMP.
The Priestess of Venus has received here into her abode both myself and Palæstra, after many mishaps and dreadful alarm, and from being in danger of our lives, desti­ tute of aid and of resources.
TRACH.
Prithee, is Palæstra, here, the beloved of my master ?
AMP.
Assuredly.
TRACH.
Great joyousness is there in your news, my dear Ampelisca.
But I greatly long to know what was this danger of yours.
AMP.
Last night our ship was wrecked, my dear Trachalio.
TRACH.
How, ship ?
What story's this ?
AMP.
Prithee, have you not heard in what way the Pro­ curer intended secretly to carry us away hence to Sicily, and how, whatever there was at home, he placed on board ship ?
That has all gone to the bottom now.
TRA.CH. 0 clever Neptune, hail to thee!
Surely, no dicer is more skilful than thyself.
Decidedly a right pleasant throw1 hast thou made ;
thou didst break a-villain.
But where now is the Procurer Labrax ?
AMP.
Perished through drinking, I suppose;
Neptune last night invited him to deep potations.
TEACH.
By my troth, I fancy it was given him to drink by way of cup of necessity2.
How much I do love you, my dear Ampelisca;
how pleasing you are;
what honied words you do utter.
But you and Palæstra, in what way were you saved ?
AMP.
I'll let you know.
Both in affright, we leapt from the ship into a boat, because we saw that the ship was being borne upon a rock ;
in haste, I unloosed the rope, while they were in dismay.
The storm separated us from them with the boat in a direction to the right.
And so, tossed about by winds and waves, in a multitude of ways, we, wretched crea­ tures, during the livelong night * * * * * * * half dead, the wind this day has scarce borne us to the shore.
TRACH.
I understand;
thus is Neptune wont to do ;
he is a very dainty Ædile3;
if any wares are bad, over he throws them all.
AMP.
Woe to your head and life!
TRACH.
To your own, my dear Ampelisca.
I was sure that the Procurer would do that which he has done;
I often said so.
It were better I should let my hair grow4, and set up for a soothsayer.
AMP.
Did you not take care then, you and your master, that he shouldn't go away, when you knew this?
TRACH.
What could he do ?
AMP.
If he was in love, do you ask what he could do ?
Both night and day he should have kept watch ;
be should have been always on his guard.
But, by my troth, he has done like many others ;
thus finely has Plesidippus taken care of her.
TEACH.
For what reason do you say that?
AMP.
The thing is evident.
TRACH.
Don't you know this ?
Even he who goes to the bath to bathe, while there he carefully keeps an eye upon his garments, still they are stolen;
inasmuch as some one of those that he is watching is a rogue ;
the thief easily marks him for whom he's upon the watch;
the keeper knows not which one is the thief.
But bring me to her;
where is she ?AMP.
Well then, go here into the Temple of Venus;
you'll find her sitting there, and in tears.
TRACH.
How disagreab.e is that to.
me already.
But why is she weeping ?
AMP.
I'll tell you;
she's afflicting herself in mind for this;
because the Procurer took away a casket from her which she had, and in which she kept that by which she might be enabled to recognize her parents;
she fears that this has been lost.
TRACH.
Where was that little casket, pray PAMP.
There, on board the ship ;
he himself locked it up in his wallet, that there mightn't be the means by which she might recognize her parents.
TEACH.
0 scandalous deed!
to require ner to be a slave, who ought to be a free woman.
AMP.
Therefore she now laments that it has gone to the bottom along with the ship.
There, too, was all the gold and silver of the Procurer.
TRACH.
Some one, I trust, has dived and brought it up.
AMP.
For this reason is she sad and disconsolate, that she has met with the loss of them.
TRACH.
Then have I the greater occasion to do this, to go in and console her, that she mayn't thus distress herself in mind.
For I know that many a lucky thing has happened to many a one beyond their hopes.
AMP.
But I know too that hope has deceived many who have hoped.
TRACH.
Therefore a patient -mind is the best remedy for affliction.
l'IT go in, unless you wish for anything.
(Goes into the Temple.)AMP.
Go. (To herself.)
I'll do that which the Priestess requested me, and I'll ask for some water here at the neigh­ bour's ;
for she said that if I asked for it in her name, they would give it directly.
And I do think that I never saw a more worthy old lady, one to whom I should think that it is more befitting for Gods and men to show kindness.
How courteously, how heartily, how kindly, how, without the least difficulty, she received us into her home, trembling, in want, drenched, shipwrecked, half dead;
not otherwise, in fact, than if we had been her own offspring.
How kindly did she herself, just now, tucking up her garments, make the water warm for us to bathe.
Now, that I mayn't keep her waiting, I'll fetch some water from the place where she re­ quested me.
(Knocking at the door of DÆMONES.)
Hallo, there, is there any one in the cottage ?
Is any one going to open this door ?
Will any one come out ?
SCEP.
Who is it so furiously making an attack upon our door?
AMP.
It's I. SCEP.
Well now, what good news is there?
(Aside.)
Dear me, a lass of comely appearance, i' troth.
AMP.
Greeting to you, young man.
SCEP.
And many greetings to you, young woman.
AMP.
I'm come to youSCEP.
I'll receive you with a welcome, if you come in the evening, by-and-by, just such as I could like;
for just now I've no means1 to receive you, a damsel, thus early in the morning * * .
But what have you to say, my smiling, pretty one.
(Chucks her under the chin.)AMP.
Oh, you're handling me too familiarly.
(Moves away.)SCEP. 0 ye immortal Gods!
she's the very image of Venus.
What joyousness there is in her eyes, and, only do see, what a skin;
'tis of the vulture's tint1,—rather, the eagle's, indeed, I meant to say.
Her breasts, too, how beautiful;
and then what expression on her lips!
(Takes hold of her.)AMP. (struggling).
I'm no common commodity for the whole township2;
can't you keep your hands off me PSCEP.
(patting her).
Won't you let me touch you, gentle one, in this manner, gently and lovingly ?. * * * * * **AMP.
When I have leisure, then I'll be giving my atten­ non to toying and dalliance to please you ;
for the present, prithee, do either say me " Yes" or " No" to the matter for which I was sent hither.
SCEP.
What now is it that you wish ?
AMP.
(pointing to her pitcher).
To a shrewd person, my equipment would give indications of what it is I want.
SCEP.
To a shrewd woman, this equipment, too, of mine, would give indication of what it is I want.
AMP. (pointing to the Temple).
The Priestess there of Ve­ nus, requested me to fetch some water from your house here.
SCEP.
But I'm a lordly sort of person;
unless you entreat me, you shan't have a drop.
We dug this well with danger to ourselves, and with tools of iron.
Not a drop can be got out of me except by means of plenty of blandishments.
AMP.
Prithee, why do you make so much fuss about the water-a thing that even enemy affords to enemy ?
SCEP.
Why do you make so much fuss about granting a favour to me, that citizen grants to citizen ?
AMP.
On the contrary, my sweet one, I'll even do every­ thing for you that you wish.
SCEP. 0 charming!
I am favoured;
she's now calling me her sweet one.
The water shall be given you, so that you mayn't be coaxing me in vain.
Give me the pitcher.
AMP.
Take it (gives it to him):
make haste and bring it out, there's a dear.
SCEP.
Stay a moment;
I'll be here this instant, my sweet one.
(Goes into the cottage.) * * * * * * * * * * *AMP.
What shall I say to the Priestess for having delayed here so long a time ?
* * * * * * *
How, even still, in my wretchedness do I tremble, when with my eyes I look upon the sea.
( She looks towards the shore.)
But what, to my sorrow, do I see afar upon the shore ?
My master, the Procurer, and his Sicilian guest, both of whom wretched I supposed to have perished in the deep.
Still does thus much more of evil survive for us than we had imagined.
But why do I delay to run off into the Temple, and to tell Palæstra this, that we may take refuge at the altar before this scoundrel of a Procurer can come hither and seize us here ?
I'll betake myself away from this spot;
for the necessity suddenly arises for me to do so.
(Runs into the Temple.)SCEP. (to himself).
0 ye immortal Gods, I never did ima­ gine that there was so great delight in water;
how heartily I did draw this.
The well seemed much less deep than formerly.
How entirely without exertion did I draw this up.
With all deferencel to myself, am I not a very silly fellow, in having only to-day made a commencement of being in love2 ?
(Turning slowly round, he holds out the pitcher.)
Here's the water for you, my pretty one;
here now, I would have you carry it with as much pleasure as I carry it, that you may please me.
(Stares around him.)
But where are you, my tit-bit ?
Do take this water, please;
where are you ?
(Again looks about.)
I' troth, she's in love with me, as I fancy;
the roguish one's playing bo-peep1.
Where are you ?
Are you going now to take this pitcher ?
Where are you, I say ?
You've carried the joke far enough.
Really, do be serious at last.
Once more, are you going to take this pitcher ?
Where in the world are you ?
(Looks about.)
I' troth, I don't see her anywhere, for my part;
she's making fun of me.
I' faith, I shall now set down this pitcher in the middle of the road.
But yet, suppose any per­ son should carry away from here this sacred pitcher of Venus, lie would be causing me some trouble.
I' faith, I'm afraid that this woman's laying a trap for me, that I may be caught with the sacred pitcher of Venus.
In such case, with very good reason, the magistrate will be letting me die in prison, if any one shall see me holding this.
For it's marked with the name ;
itself tells its own tale, whose property it is.
Troth now, I'll call that Priestess here out of doors, that she may take this pitcher.
I'll go there to the door.
(He knocks.)
Hallo there!
Ptolemocratia.
(Calling aloud.)
Take this pitcher of yours, please;
some young woman, I don't know who, brought it here to me.
(A pause.)
It must then be carried in-doors by me.
I've found myself a job, if, in fact, of my own accord, water is to be carried by me for these people as well.
(Goes into the Temple with the pitcher.)LAB. (grumbling to himself).
The person that chooses him.
self to be wretched and a beggar, let him trust himself and.
his life to Neptune.
For if any one has any dealings at all with him, he sends him back home equipped in this guise.
(Surveying himself.)
By my troth, Liberty, you were a clever one, who were never willing3 to put even a foot, i' faith, on board ship with me.
But (looking round) where's this guest of mine that has proved my ruin ?
Oh, see, here he comes.
CHARM.
Where the plague are you hurrying to, Labrax ?
For really I cannot follow you so fast.
LAB.
I only wish that you had perished by direful torments in Sicily before I bad looked upon you with my eyes, you on whose account this misfortune has befallen me.
CHARM.
I only wish that on the day on which you admitted me into your house, I had laid me down in a prison sooner.
I pray the immortal Gods, that so long as you live, you may have all your guests just like your own self.
LAB.
In your person I admitted misfortune into my house.
What business had I to listen to a rogue like you, or what to depart hence ?
Or why to go on board ship, where I have lost even more wealth1 than I was possessor of?
CHARM.
Troth,
I'm far from being surprised if your ship has been wrecked, which was carrying yourself, a villain, and your property villanously acquired.
LAB.
You've utterly rained me with your wheedling speeches.
CHARM.
A more accursed dinner of yours have I been dining upon than the ones that were set before Thyestes and Tereus2.
LAB.
I'm dying;
I'm sick at heart.
Prithee, do hold up ray head.
CHARM.
By my troth, I could very much wish that you would vomit up your lungs.
LAB.
Alas !
Palæstra and Ampelisca, where are you now?
CHARM.
Supplying food for the fishes at the bottom, I suppose.
LAB.
You have brought beggary upon me by your means, while I was listening to your bragging lies.
CHARM.
You have reason deservedly to give me many hearty thanks, who from an insipid morsel by my agency have made you salts.
LAB.
Nay, but do you get out from me to extreme and utter perdition.
CHARM.
You be off;
I was just going to do that very thing.
LAB.
Alas!
what mortal being is there living more wretched than I ?CHARM.
I am by very far much more wretched, Labrax, than yourself.
LAB.
How so P CHARM.
Because I am not deserving of it, whereas you are deserving.
LAB.
0 bulrush, bulrush, I do praise your lot, who always maintain your credit for dryness.
CHARM. (his teeth chattering).
For my part, I'm exercising myself for a skirmishing fight1, for, from my shivering, I utter all my words in piecemeal flashes.
LAB.
By my troth, Neptune, you axe a purveyor of chilly baths;
since I got away from you with my clothes, I've been freezing.
No hot liquor-shop2 at all for sure does he provide ;
so salt and cold the potions that he prepares.
CHARM.
How lucky are the blacksmiths, who are always sitting among hot coals ;
they are always warm.
LAB.
I only wish that I were now enjoying the lot of the duck, so as, although I had just come from out of the water, still to be dry.
CHARM.
What if I some way or other let myself out at the games for a bobgoblin3 ?
LAB.
For what reason PCHARM.
Because, i' faith, I'm chattering aloud with my teeth.
But I'm of opinion that, with very good reason, I've had this ducking.
CHARM.
Why, haven't I ventured to go on board ship with yourself, who have been stirring up the ocean for me from the very bottom PLAB.
I listened to you when advising me ;
you assured me that there in Sicily was very great profit from courtesans;
there, you used to say, I should be able to amass wealth.
CHARM.
Did you expect, then, you unclean beast, that you were going to gobble up the whole island of Sicily ?
LAB.
What whale, I wonder, has gobbled up my walle here all my gold and silver was packed up ?
CHARM.
That same one, I suppose, that has swallowed my purse, which was full of silver in my travelling-bag.
LAB.
Alas!
I'm reduced even to this one poor tunic (stretching it out) and to this poor shabby cloak ;
I'm done for to all intents.
CHARM.
Then you may even go into partnership with me;
we have got equal shares.
LAB.
If at least my damsels had been saved, there would have been some hope.
Now, if the young man Plesidippus should be seeing me, from whom I received the earnest for Palæstra, he'll then be causing me some trouble in conse­ quence.
(He begins to cry.)CHARM.
Why cry, you fool ?
Really, by my troth, so long as your tongue shall exist, you have abundance with which to make payment to everybody1.
SCEP. (to himself, aloud).
What to-do is this, I'd like to know, that two young women here in the Temple, in tears, are holding in their embrace the statue of Venus, dread­ ing I know not what in their wretchedness ?
But they say that this last night they have been tossed about, and to-day cast on shore from the waves.
LAB. (overhearing).
Troth now, young man, prithee, where are these young women that you are talking of?
SCEP.
Here (pointing) in the Temple of Venus.
LAB.
How many are there ?
SCEP.
Just as many as you and I make.
LAB.
Surely, they are mine.
SCEP.
Surely, I know nothing about that.
LAB.
Of what appearance are they ?
SCEP.
Good-looking;
I could even fall in love with either of them, if I were well liquored.
LAB.
Surely, they are the damsels.
SCEP.
Surely, you are a nuisance;
be off, go in and see, if you like.
LAB.
These must be my wenches in here, my dear Char­ mides.
CHARM.
Jupiter confound you, both if they are and still if they are not.
LAB.
I'll straightway burst into this Temple of Venus here.
CHARM.
Into the bottomless pit, I would rather.
(LABRAX rushes into the Temple, and shuts the door.)CHARM.
Prithee, stranger, show me some spot where I may go to sleep.
SCEP.
Go to sleep there, wherever you please (points to the ground);
no one hinders, it's free to the public.
CHARM. (pointing to his clothes).
But do you see me, in what wet clothes I'm dressed ?
Do take me under shelter;
lend me some dry clothes, while my own are drying;
on some occasion I'll return you the favour.
SCEP.
See, here's my outer coat, which alone is dry;
that, if you like, I'll lend you.
(Takes it off and holds it out to him.)
In that same I'm wont to be clothed, by that same protected, when it rains.
Do you give me those clothes of yours;
I'll soon have them dried.
CHARM.
How now, are you afraid that, as I've been washed bare1 last night at sea, I mayn't be made bare again here .
upon shore ?
SCEP.
Wash you bare, or anoint, you well, I don't care one fig2.
I shall never entrust anything to you unless upon a pledge being taken.
Do you either sweat away or perish with cold, be you either sick or well.
I'll put up with no stranger-guest in my house;
I've had disagreements enough.
Puts on his coat again, and goes into the house of DÆMONES.)CHARM.
What, are you off?
(A pause.)
He's a traf­ ficker in slaves for money1;
whoever he is, he has no bowels2 of compassion.
But why in my wretchedness am I standing here, soaking ?
Why don't I rather go away from here into the Temple of Venus, that I may sleep off this debauch which I got with drinking last night against the bent of my inclina­ tion?
Neptune has been drenching us with salt water as though we were Greek wines3, and so he hoped that our stomachs might be vomited up with his salt draughts.
What need of words ?
If he had persisted in inviting us a little longer, we should have gone fast asleep there;
as it is, hardly alive has he sent us off home.
Now I'll go see the Pro­ curer, my boon companion, what he's doing within.
(Goes into the Temple.)DÆM. (to himself).
In wondrous ways4 do the Gods make sport of men, in wondrous fashions do they send dreams in sleep.
Not the sleeping, even, do they allow to rest.
As, for example, I, this last night which has gone by, dreamed a won­ derful and a curious dream.
A she-ape seemed to be endea­ vouring to climb up to a swallow's nest;
and she was not able thence to take them out.
After that, the ape seemed to come to me to beg me to lend a ladder to her.
I in these terms gave answer to the ape, that swallows are the descendants of Philomela5 and of Progne.
I expostulated with her, that she might not hurt those of my country.
But then she began to be much more violent, and seemed gratuitously to be threatening me with vengeance.
She summoned me to a court of justice.
Then, in my anger, I seemed to seize hold of the ape by the middle, in what fashion I know not;
and I fastened up with chains this most worthless beast.
Now to what purpose I shall say that this dream tends, never have I this day been able to come to any conclusion.
(A loud noise is heard in the Temple.)
But what's this noise that arises in this Temple of Venus, my neighbour ?
My mind's in wonder about it.
TRACH. (aloud).
0 citizens of Cyrene, I implore your aid, countrymen, you who are near neighbours to these spots, bring aid to helplessness, and utterly crush a most vile at­ tempt.
Inflict vengeance, that the power of the wicked, who wish themselves to be distinguished by crimes, may not be stronger than of the guiltless.
Make an example for the shameless man, give its reward to modest virtue;
cause that one may be allowed to live here rather under the control of the laws than of brute force.
Hasten hither into the Temple of Venus;
again do I implore your aid, you who are here at hand and who hear my cries.
Bring assistance to those who, after the recognized usage, have entrusted their lives to Venus and to the Priestess of Venus, under their protection.
Wring ye the neck of iniquity before it reaches yourselves.
DÆM.
What's all this to-do ?
TRACH. (embracing his knees).
By these knees of yours, I do entreat you, old gen­ tleman, whoever you areDÆM.
Nay, but do you let go my knees, then, and tell me why it is that you are making a noise ?
TRACH.
I do beg and entreat you, that if you hope this year that you will have abundance of laserwort and silphium1, and that that export will arrive at Capua2 safe and sound, and that you may ever enjoy freedom from diseased eyesDÆM.
Are you in your senses PTRACK.
-Or whether you trust that you will have plenty of juice of silphium1, that you will not hesitate to give me the aid which I shall entreat of you, aged sir.
DÆM.
And I, by your legs, and ancles, and back, do entreat you that, if you hope that you will have a crop of elm-twigs, and that a fruitful harvest of beatings will this year be your lot, you will tell me what's the matter here, by reason of which you are making this uproar.
TRACH.
Why do you choose to speak me ill ?
For my part, I wished you everything that's good.
DÆM.
And for my part, I'm speaking you well, in praying that things which you deserve may befall you.
TRAcK.
Prithee, do prevent this.
DÆM.
What's the matter, then ?
TRACH. (pointing to the Temple).
Two innocent women are inside here, in need of your aid, on whom, against law and justice, an injury has been, is being, glaringly committed here in the Temple of Venus.
Besides, the Priestess of Venus is being disgracefully insulted.
DÆM.
What person.
is there of effrontery so great as to dare to injure the Priestess ?
But these women, who are they ?
Or what injury is being done to them ?
TRACH.
If you give me your attention, I'll tell you.
They have clung to the statue of Venus;
a most audacious fellow is now trying to tear them away.
They ought, by rights, both of them to be free.
DÆM.
What fellow is it that so lightly holds the Gods ?
In a few words tell me.
TRACH.
One most full of fraud, villany, parricide, and perjury ;
a lawbreaker, an immodest, unclean, most shameless fellow;
to sum up all in one word, he is a Procurer;
why need I say more about him PDÆM.
Troth now, you tell of a man that ought to be handed over to retribution.
TRACH.
A villain, to seize the Priestess by the throat.
DÆM.
By my troth, but he has done it at his own great peril.
(Calls aloud at his door.)
Come you out of doors here, Turbalio and Sparax ;
where are you ?
TEACH.
Prithee, do go in, and hasten to tneir rescue.
DÆM. (impatiently).
And am I to call for them once more PDÆM.
Follow me this way.
TEACH.
Come on now this instant, bid them tear his eyes out, just in the way that cooks do cuttle-fish1.
DÆM.
Drag the fellow out here by his legs, just like a slaughtered pig.
(DÆMONES and his SERVANTS go into the Temple.)TRACH. (listening at the door).
I hear a scuffling ;
the Pro­ curer, I guess, is being belaboured with their fists ;
I'd very much like them to knock the teeth out of the jaws of the most villanous fellow.
But see, here are the women them­ selves coming out of the Temple in consternation.
PAL.
Now is that time arrived when destitution of all re­ sources and aid, succour and defence, overtakes us.
Neither hope nor means is there to bring us aid, nor know we in what direction we should commence to proceed.
In exceeding terror now are we both, in this our wretchedness.
Such cruelty and such outrage have been committed towards us just now in-doors here by our master, who, in his villany, pushed down the old lady, the Priestess, headlong, and struck her in a very disgraceful manner, and .with his violence tore us away from the inner side2 of the statue.
But as our lot and fortunes are now showing themselves, 'twere best to die, nor in our miseries is there anything better than death.
TEACH, (behind).
What's this?
Whose words are those?
Why do I delay to console them ? (Aloud.)
Harkye, Pa­ læstra, Ampelisca, harkye !PAL.
Prithee, who is it that calls us ?
AMP.
Who is it that calls me by name PTRACH.
If you turn round and look, you'll know.
PAL. (turning round).
0 hope of my safety!
TRACH.
Be silent and of good courage ;
trust me1.
PAL.
If only it can be so, let not violence overwhelm us.
TRACH.
What violence ?
PAL.
That same which is driving me to commit violence on myself.
TRACH.
Oh, do leave off;
you are very silly.
PAL.
Then do you leave off at once your consoling me in my misery with words.
AMP.
Unless you afford us protection in reality2, Trachalio, it's all over with us.
PAL.
I'm resolved to die sooner than suffer this Procurer to get me in his power.
But still I am of woman's heart;
when, in my misery, death comes into my mind, fear takes possession of my limbs.
TRACH.
By my troth, although this is a bitter affliction, do have a good heart.
PAL.
Why where, pray, is a good heart to be found for me ?
TEACH.
Don't you fear, I tell you;
sit you down here by the altar.
(Points to it.)AMP.
What can this altar possibly avail us more than the statue here within the Temple of Venus, from which just now, embracing it, in our wretchedness, we were torn by force PTRACE.
Only you be seated here;
then I'll protect you in this spot.
This altar you possess as though your bul­ warks3 ;
these your fortifications;
from this spot will I defend you.
With the aid of Venus, I'll march against the wicked­ ness of the Procurer.
PAL.
We follow your instructions (they advance to the altar and kneel) ;
and genial Venus, we both of us, in tears, implore thee, embracing this thy altar, bending upon our knees, that thou wilt receive us into thy guardianship, and be our protector ;
that thou wilt punish those wretches who have set at nought thy Temple, and that thou wilt suffer us to occupy this thy altar with thy permission, we who last night were by the might of Neptune cast away ;
hold us not in scorn, and do not for that reason impute it to us as a fault, if there is anything that thou shouldst think is not so well attended to1 by us as it ought to have been.
TRACH.
I think they ask what's just;
it ought, Venus, by thee to be granted.
Thou oughtst to pardon them;
'tis terror forces them to do this.
They say that thou wast born from a shell2;
take thou care that thou dost not despise the shells of these.
But see, most opportunely the old gentleman is coming out, both my protector and your own.
(He goes to the altar.)
DÆM.
Come out of the Temple, you most sacrilegious of men, as many as have ever been born.
Do you go (calling to the WOMEN) and sit by the altar.
(Not seeing them near the door.)
But where are they ?
TRACH.
Look round here.
DÆM. (looking round).
Very good;
I wanted that3.
Now bid him come this way.
(To LABRAX.)
Are you attempting here among us to commit a violation of the laws against the Deities ?
(To the SERVANTS, who obey with alacrity.)
Punch his face with your fists.
LAB.
I'm suffering these indignities at your own cost.
DÆM.
Why, the insolent fellow's threatening even.
LAB.
I've been robbed of my rights;
you are robbing me of my female slaves against my will.
TRACH.
Do you then find some wealthy man of the Senate of Cyrene as judge, whether these women ought to be yours, or whether they oughtn't to be free, or whether it isn't right that you should be clapped into prison, and there spend your life, until you have worn the whole gaol out with your feet.
LAB.
I wasn't prepared to prophesy for this day that I should be talking with a hang-gallows1 like yourself.
(Turn­ ing to DÆMONES.)
You do I summon to judgment.
DÆM. (pointing to TRACHALIO).
In the first place, try it with him who knows you.
LAB. (to DÆMONES).
My suit is with yourself.
TEACH.
But it must be with myself.
(Pointing to the WOMEN.)
Are these your female slaves ?
LAB.
They are.
TEACH.
Just come then, touch either of them with your little finger only.
LAB.
What if I do touch them ?
TEACH.
That very instant, upon my faith, I'll make a hand­ ball2 of you, and while you're in the air I'll belabour you with my fists, you most perjured, villain.
LAB.
Am I not to be allowed to take away my female slaves from the altar of Venus ?
DÆM.
You may not;
such is the law with is.
LAB.
I've no concern with your laws;
for mv part, I shall at once carry them both away from here3.
If you are in love with them, old gentleman (holding out his hand), you must down here with the ready cash.
DÆM.
But these women have proved pleasing to Venus.
LAB.
She may have them, if she pays the money.
DiEm.
A Goddess, pay you money ?
Now then, that you may understand my determination, only do you commence in mere joke to offer them the very slightest violence;
I'll send you away from here with such a dressing, that you won't know your own self.
You, therefore (turning to his SER­ VANTS), when I give you the signal, if you don't beat his eyes out of his head, I'll trim you round about with rods just like beds of myrtle1 with bulrushes.
LAB.
You are treating me with violence.
TRACH.
What, do you even upbraid us with violence, you flagrant specimen of flagitiousness ?
LAB.
TOU, you thrice- dotted villainy do you dare to speak abusively to me PTeach.
I am a thrice-dotted villain;
I confess it;
you are a strictly honorable man;
ought these women a bit the less to be free ?
LAB.
What—free ?
TRACH.
Aye, and your mistresses, too, i' faith, and from genuine Greece3;
for one of them was born at Athens of free-born parents.
DÆM.
What is it I hear from you ?
TRACH.
That she (pointing to PALÆSTRA) was born at Athens, a free-born woman.
DÆM. (to TRACHALIO).
Prithee is she a countrywoman of mine ?
TRACH.
Are you not a Cyrenian?
DÆM.
No;
born at Athens in Attica, bred and educated there.
TRACH.
Prithee, aged sir, do protect your countrywomen.
DÆM. (aside).
0 daughter, when I look on her, separated from me you remind me of my miseries:
(aloud) she who was lost by me when three years old;
now, if she is living, she's just about as tall, I'm sure, as she.
(Pointing to PALÆSTRA.)LAB.
I paid the money down for these two, to their owners, of whatever country they were.
What matters it to me whether they were born at Athens or at Thebes, so long as they are rightfully in servitude as my slaves ?
TRACH.
Is it so, you impudent fellow ?
What, are you, a cat prowling after maidens, to be keeping children here kidnapped from their parents and destroying them in your disgraceful calling ?
But as for this other one, I really don't know what her country is;
I only know that she's more de­ serving than yourself, you most abominable rascal.
LAB.
Are these women your property ?
TEACH.
Come to the trial, then, which of the two according to his back is the more truthful;
if you don't bear more com­ pliments1 upon your back than any ship of war2 has nails, then I'm the greatest of liars.
Afterwards, do you examine mine, when I've examined yours;
if it shall not prove to be so untouched, that any leather flask makerS will say that it is a hide most capital and most sound for the purposes of his business, what reason is there why 1 shouldn't mangle you with stripes, even till you have your belly full ?
Why do you stare at them ?
If you touch them I'll tear your eyes out.
LAB.
Yet notwithstanding, although you forbid me to do so, I'll at once carry them off both together with me.
DÆM.
What will you do ?
LAB.
I'll bring Vulcan;
he is an enemy to Venus4.
(Goes towards DÆMONES' cottage.)
TRACH.
Whither is he going ?
LAB.
(calling at the door).
Hallo!
Is there anybody here ?
Hallo!
I say.
DÆM.
If you touch the door, that very instant, upon my faith, you shall get a harvest upon your face with fists for your pitchforks5.
SERVo
We keep no fire, we live upon dried figs.
DÆM.
I'll find the fire, if only I have the opportunity of kindling it upon your head.
LAB.
Faith, I'll go somewhere to look for some fire.
DÆM.
What, when you've found it ?
LAB.
I'll be making a great fire here.
DÆM.
What, to be burning1 a mortuary sacrifice for your­ self?
LAB.
No, but I'll burn both of these alive here upon tho altar.
DÆM.
I'd like that.
For, by my troth, I'll forthwith seize you by the head and throw you into the fire, and, half-roasted, I'll throw you out as food for the great birds.
(Aside.)
When ] come to a consideration of it with myself, this is that ape, that wanted to take away those swallows from the nest against my will, as I was dreaming in my sleep.
TRACH.
Aged sir, do you know what I request of you ?
That you will protect these females and defend them from violence, until I fetch my master.
DÆM.
Go look for your master, and fetch him here.
TEACH.
But don't let himDÆM.
At his own ex­ treme peril, if he touches them, or if he attempts to do so.
TRACH.
Take care.
DÆM.
Due care is taken;
do you be on.
TRACH.
And watch him too, that he doesn't go away any­ where.
For we have promised either to give the executioner a great talent, or else to produce this fellow this very day.
DÆM.
Do you only be off.
I'll not let him get away, while you are absent.
TEACH.
I'll be back here soon.
(Exit TRACHALIO.DÆM. (to LABRAX, who is struggling with the SERVANTS).
Which, you Procurer, had you rather do, be quiet with a thrashing, or e'en as it is, without the thrashing, if you had the choice ?
LAB.
Old fellow, I don't care a straw for what you say.
My own women, in fact, I shall drag away this instant from the altar by the hair, in spite of yourself, and Venus, and supreme Jove.
DÆM.
Just touch them.
LAB. (going towards them), I' troth, I surely will touch them.
DÆM.
Just come then;
only approach this way.
LAB.
Only bid both those fellows, then, to move away from there.
DÆM.
On the contrary, they shall move towards you.
LAB.
I' faith, for my own part, I don't think so.
DÆM.
If they do move nearer to you, what will you do PLAB.
I'll retire.
But, old fellow, if ever I catch you in the city, never again, upon my faith, shall any one call me a Procurer, if I don't give you some most disagreable sport.
DÆM.
Do what you threaten.
But now, in the mean­ time, if you do touch them, a heavy punishment shall be inflicted on you.
LAB.
How heavy, in fact ?
DÆM.
Just as much as is sum­ cient for a Procurer.
LAB.
These threats of yours I don't value one straw;
I certainly shall seize them both this instant without your leave.
DÆM.
Just touch them.
LAB.
By my troth, I surely will touch them.
DÆM.
You will touch them, but do you know with what result ?
Go then, Turbalio, with all haste, and bring hither from out of the house two cudgels.
LAB.
Cudgels ?
DÆM.
Aye, good ones;
make haste speedily.
(TURBALIO goes in.)
I'll let you have a reception this day in proper style, as you are deserving of.
LAB. (aside).
Alas!
cursedly unfortunate.
I lost my head­ piece in the ship;
it would now have been handy for me, if it had been saved.
(To DÆMONES.)
May I at least address these women ?
DÆM.
You may not * * ** * (TURBALIO enters, bringing two cudgels.)
Well now, by my faith, look, the cudgel-man is coming very opportunely here.
LAB. (aside).
By my troth, this surely is a tingling for my ears.
DÆM.
Come, Sparax, do you take this other cudgel.
( Giving him one.
) Come, take your stand, one on one side, the othei in oneother.
Take your stations both of you.
(They stand with lifted cudgels on each side ofthe altar.)
Just so.
Now then attend to me:
if, i' faith, thatfellow there should this day touch these women with his finger against their inclination, if youdon't give him a receptionl with these cudgels even to that degree that he shan't know which way he is to get home, you are undone, both of you.
If he shall call for any one, do you make answer to this fellow in their stead.
But if he himself shall attempt to get away from here, that instant, as hard as you can, lay on to his legs with your sticks.
LAB.
Are they not even to allow me to go away from here ?
DÆM.
I've said sufficient.
And when that servant comes here with his master, he that has gone to fetch his master, do you at once go home.
Attend to this with great dili­ gence, will you.
(DÆMONES goes into his house.)LAB.
0 rare, by my troth, the Temple here is surely changed all of a sudden;
this is now the Temple of Her­ cules2 which was that of Venus before ;
in such fashion has the old fellow planted two statues here with clubs.
I' faith, I don't know now whither in the world I shall fly from here;
so greatly are they both raging now against me, both land and sea.
Palæstra !SERVo
What do you want ?
LAB.
Away with you, there is a misunderstanding between us ;
that, indeed, is not my Palæstra3 that answers.
Harkye, Ampelisca.
SERVo
Beware of a mishap, will you.
LAB. (aside).
So far as they can, the worthless fellows advise me rightly enough.
(Aloud.)
But, harkye, I ask you, whether it is any harm to you for me to come nearer to these women ?
SERV.
Why none at all to ourselves.
LAB.
Will there be any harm to myself?
SERV.
None at all, if you only take care.
LAB.
What is it that I'm to take care against?
SERVo
Why, look you, against a heavy mishap.
LAB.
Troth now, prithee, do let me approach them.
SERV.
Approach them, if you like.
LAB.
I' faith, obligingly done;
I return you thanks, I'll go nearer to them.
(Approaches them.)SERVo
Do you stand there on the spot, where you are.
(Drags him to his place, with the cudgel over his head.)LAB. (aside).
By my faith, I've come scurvily off in many ways.
Still, I'm resolved to get the better of them this day by constantly besieging them.
PLES.
And did the Procurer attempt by force and violence to drag my mistress away from the altar of Venus ?
TRACH.
Even so.
PLES.
Why didn't you kill him on the instant ?
TRACH.
I hadn't a sword.
PLEa.
You should have taken either a stick or a stone.
TRACH.
What!
ought I to have pelted this most villanous fellow with stones like a dog ?
* * * * * * * * *LAB. (aside, on seeing them).
By my troth, but I'm un­ done now;
see, here's Plesidippus;
he'll be sweeping me away altogether this moment with the dust.
PLES.
Were the damsels sitting on the altar even then when you set out to come to me ?
TRACH.
Tes, and now they are sitting in the same place.
PLES.
Who is now protecting them there ?
TRACH.
Some old gentleman, I don't know who, a neigh­ hour of the Temple of Venus-he gave very kind assistance;
he is now protecting them with his servants—I committed them to his charge.
PLEa.
Lead me straight to the Procurer.
Where is this fellow ?
(They go towards LABRAX.)LiE. Health to you.
PLES.
I want none of your healths.
Make your choice quickly, whether you had rather be seized by your throat wrenched1, or be dragged along;
choose which­ ever you please, whIle you may.
LAB.
I wish for neither.
PLES.
Be off then, Trachalio, with all speed to the sea-shore ;
bid those persons that I brought with me to hand over this rascal to the executioner, to come from the harbour to the city to meet me ;
afterwards return hither and keep guard here.
I'll now drag this scoundrelly outcast to justice.
(Exit TRACHALIO.PLES. (to LABRAX).
Come, proceed to a court of justice.
LAB.
In what have I offended?
FLES.
Do vou ask?
Didn't you receive an earnest of me for this woman (pointing to PALÆSTRA), and carry her off from here ?
LAB.
I didn't carry her off.
PLES.
Why do you deny it ?
LAB.
Troth now, because I put her on board ship ;
carry her off, unfortunately, I couldn't.
For my part, I told you that this day I would make my appearance at the Temple of Venus;
have I swerved at all from that ?
Am I not there ?
PLES.
Plead your cause in the court of justice;
here a word is enough.
Follow me.
(They lay hold of him.)LAB. (calling aloud).
I entreat you, my dear Charmides, do come to my rescue;
I am being seized with my throat wrenched.
CHARM. (looking about).
Who calls my name ?
LAB.
Do you see me how I'm being seized ?
CHARM.
I see, and view it with pleasure.
LAB.
Don't you venture to assist me ?
CHARM.
What person is seizing you ?
LAB.
Young Plesidippus.
CHARM.
What you've got, put up with ;
'twere better for you, with a cheerful spirit, to slink to gaol;
that has be­ fallen you which many greatly wish for for themselves.
LAB.
What's that ?
CHARM.
To find for themselves that which they are seeking.
LAB.
I entreat you, do follow me.
CHARM.
You try to persuade me, just like what you are :
you are being taken off to gaol, for that reason is it you entreat me to follow you ?PLEB. (to LABRAX).
Do you still resist PLAB.
I'm undone.
PLES.
I trust that may prove the truth.
You, my dear Palæstra and Ampelisca, do you re­ main here in the meanwhile, until I return hither.
SERVo I would advise them rather to go to our house, until you return.
PLEB.
I'm quite agreable;
you act obligingly.
(The SERVANTS open the door of the cottage, and PALÆSTRA and AMPELISCA go in.)LAB.
You are thieves to me.
SERVo How, thieves ?
PLES.
Lead him along.
(The SERVANTS seize him.)LAB. (calling out).
I pray and entreat you, Palæstra.
PLES.
Follow, you hang-dog.
LAB.
Guest, Charmides!
CHARM.
I am no guest of yours;
I repudiate your hospi­ tality.
LAB.
What, do you slight me in this fashion ?
CHARM.
I do so ;
I've been drinking with you once already1.
LAB.
May the Deities confound you.
CHARM.
To that person of yours, say that.
(PLESIDIPPUS leads LABRAX off,followed by the SERVANTS.)CHARM.
I do believe that men are transformed, each into a different beast.
That Procurer, I guess, is transformed into a stock-dove2;
for, before long, his neck will be in the itocks.
He'll to-day be building his nest in the gaol.
Still, nowever, I'll go, that I may be his advocate,-if by my aid he may possibly be sentenced any the sooner.
DÆM. (to himself.)
'Twas rightly done, and it s a pleasure this day for me to have given aid to these young women;
I have now found some dependants, and both of them of comely looks and youthful age.
But my plaguy wife is watching me in all ways, lest I should be giving any hint to the young women.
But I wonder what in the world my servant Gripus is about, who went last night to the sea to fish.
Troth, he had done wiser if he had slept at home ;
for now he throws away both his pains and his nets, seeing what a storm there now is and was last night.
I'll thoroughly cook upon my fingers what he has caught to-day;
so violently do I see the ocean heaving.
(A bell rings.)
But my wife's calling me to breakfast;
I'll return home.
She'll now be filling my ears with her silly prating.
(Goes into the cottage.)GRIP. (to himself).
These thanks do I return to Neptune, my patron, who dwells in the salt retreats, the abode of fishes, inasmuch as he has despatched me finely laden on my return from his retreats, and from his Temples, laden with most abundant booty, with safety to my boat, which in the stormy sea made me master of a singular and rich haul.
In a won­ drous and incredible manner has this haul turned out prosper­ ously for me, nor yet have I this day taken a single ounce weight of fish, but'only that which I am here bringing with me in my net.
For when I arose in the middle of the night, and without sloth, I preferred profit to sleep and rest;
in the raging tempest, I determined to try how I might lighten the poverty of my master and my own servitude, not sparing of my own exertions.
Most worthless is the man that is sloth­ ful, and most detestably do I hate that kind of men.
It be­ hoves him to be vigilant who wishes to do his duty in good time;
for it befits him not to be waiting until his master arouses him to his duties.
For those who sleep on for the love of it, rest without profit to themselves and to their own cost.
But now I, who have not been slothful, have found that for myself through which to be slothful if I should choose.
(Points to the wallet.)
This have I found in the sea to-day;
whatever's in it, it's something heavy that's in it;
I think it's gold that's in it.
And not a single person is there my confidant in the matter.
Now, Gripus, this opportunity has befallen you, that the Prætor1 might make you a free man from among the multitude.
Now, thus shall I do, this is my determination;
I'll come to my master cleverly and cunningly, little by little I'll promise money for my freedom, that I may be free.
Now, when I shall be free, then, in fine, I'll provide me land and houses2 and slaves:
I'll carry on merchandize with large ships :
among the grandees I shall be considered a grandee.
Afterwards, for the sake of pleasing myself, I'll build me a ship and I'll imitate Stratonicus3, and I'll be carried about from town to town.
When my greatness is far-spread, I shall fortify some great city:
to that city I shall give the name of " Gripus," a memorial of my fame and ex­ ploits, and there I'll establish a mighty kingdom.
I am re­ solving here in my mind to prepare for mighty matters.
At present I'll hide this booty.
But this grandee (pointing to himself) is about to breakfast upon vinegar4 and salt, with­ out any good substantial meat.
(Gathers up the net, and drags it after him.)TRACH.
Hallo there!
stop.
GRIP.
Why should I stop ?
TEACH.
While I coil up this rope5 for you that you are dragging.
GRIP.
Now let it alone.
TRACH.
Troth, but I'll assist you.
What's kindly done to worthy men, isn't thrown away.
GRIP.
* * * * *
There was a boisterous tempest yesterday ;
no fish have I, young man;
don't you be supposing I have.
Don't you see that I'm carrying my dripping net without the scaly race ?
TEACH.
I' faith, I'm not wishing for fish so much as I am in need of your conversation.
GRIP.
Then, whoever you are, you are worrying me to death with your annoyance.
TRACH. (takes hold of him).
I'll not allow you to go away from here;
stop.
GRIP.
Take you care of a mishap, if you please;
but why the plague are you dragging me back ?
TRACH.
Listen.
GRIP.
I won't listen.
GRIP.
Nay but, another time, tell me what you want.
TEACH.
Come now, it's worth your while at once to hear what I want to tell you.
GRIP.
Say on, whatever it is.
TRACH.
See whether any person is following near us.
(Looks back.)
GRIP.
Why, what reason is there that it should matter to me ?
TRACH.
So it is;
but can you give me some good advice ?
GRIP.
What's the business ?
Only tell me.
TRACH.
I'll tell you;
keep silence;
if only you'll give me your word that you won't prove treacherous to me.
GRIP.
I do give you my word;
I'll be true to you, whoever you are.
TRACH.
Listen.
I saw a person commit a theft;
I knew the owner to whom that same property belonged.
Afterwards I came myself to the thief, and I made him a proposal in these terms:
" I know the person on whom that theft was com­ mitted ;
now if you are ready to give me half, I'll not make a discovery to the owner."
He didn't even give me an answer.
What is it fair should be given me out of it ?
Half, I trust you will say.
GRIP.
Aye, even more;
but unless he gives it you, I think it ought to be told to the owner.
TRACH.
I'll act on your advice.
Now give me your atten­ tion ;
for it is to yourself all this relates.
GRIP.
What has been done by me ?
TRACH.
(pointing at the wallet).
I've known the person for a long time to whom that wallet belongs.
GRIP.
What do you mean ?
TRACH.
And in what manner it was lost.
GRIP.
But I know in what manner it was found;
and I know the person who found it, and who is now the owner.
That, i' faith, is not a bit the more your matter than it is my own.
I know the person to whom it now belongs;
you, the person to whom it formerly belonged.
This shall no indivi­ dual get away from me ;
don't you be expecting to get it in a hurry.
TRACH.
If the owner comes, shan't he get it away ?.
GRIP.
That you mayn't be mistaken, no born person is there that's owner of this but my own self-who took this in my own fishing.
TRACH.
Was it really so PGRIP.
Which fish in the sea will you say "is my own?"
When I catch them, if indeed I do catch them, they are my own;
as my own I keep them.
They are not claimed as having a right to freedoml, nor does any person demand a share in them.
In the market I sell them all openly as my own wares.
Indeed, the sea is, surely, common to all persons.
TRACH.
I agree to that;
prithee, then, why any the less is it proper that this wallet should be common to me ?
It was found in the sea.
GRIP.
Assuredly you are an outrageously impudent fellow;
for if this is justice which you are saying, then fishermen would be ruined.
Inasmuch as, the moment that the fish were exposed upon the stalls, no one would buy them;
every person would be demanding his own share of the fish for him­ self;
he would be saying that they were caught in the sea that was common to all.'
TRACH.
What do you say, you impudent fellow ?
Do you dare to compare a wallet with fish ?
Pray, does it appear to be the same thing ?
GRIP.
The matter doesn't lie in my power;
when I've cast my hook and net into the sea, whatever has adhered I draw out.
Whatever my net and hooks have got, that in especial is my own.
TEACH.
Nay but, i' faith, it is not;
if, indeed, you've fished up any article that's made1.
GRIP.
Philosopher, you.
TRACH.
But look now, you conjurer, did you ever see a fisherman who caught a wallet-fish, or exposed one for sale in the market ?
But, indeed, you shan't here be taking possession of all the profits that you choose;
you expect, you dirty fellow, to be both a maker of wallets2 and a fisherman.
Either you must show me a fish that is a wallet, or else you shall carry nothing off that wasn't produced in the sea and has no scales.
GRIP.
What, did you never hear before to-day that a wallet was a fish ?
TRACH.
Villain, there is no suchfish.
GRIP.
Yes, there certainly is;
I, who am a fisherman, know it.
But it is seldom caught;
no fish more rarely comes near the land.
TRACH.
It's to no purpose;
you hope that you can be cheating me, you rogue.
Of what colour is it ?
GRIP.
(looking at the wallet).
Of this colour very few are caught:
some are of a purple skin, there are great and black ones also.
TRACH.
I understand;
by my troth, you'll be turning into a wallet-fish I fancy, if you don't take care;
your skin will be purple, and then afterwards black.
GRIP. (aside).
What a villain this that I have met with to-day!
TRACH, We are wasting words;
the day wears apace.
Consider, please, by whose arbitration do you wish us to proceed ?
GRIP.
By the arbitration of the wallet.
TRACH.
Really so, indeed ?
You are a fool.
GRIP.
My respects to you, Mister Thales3.
(Going.)TRACK. (holding him).
You shan't carry that off this day, unless you find a place of safe keeping for it, or all umpire, by whose arbitration this matter may be settled.
GRIP.
Prithee, are you in your senses ?
TRACH.
I'm mad, in need of hellebore.
GRIP.
But I'm troubled with sprites;
still I shan't let this go.
(Hugs the wallet.)
TRACH.
Only add a single word more, that instant I'll drive my fists smash into your brains.
This instant on this spot, just as a new napkin is wont to be wrung, I'll wring out of you whatever moisture there is, if you don't let this go.
(Seizes the wallet.)GRIP.
Touch me;
I'll dash you down on the ground just in such fashion as I'm in the habit of doing with a poly­ pus fish1.
Would you like to fight?
(Assumes a boxing at­ titude.)
TRACH.
What need is there P Nay, in preference, divide the booty.
GRIP.
You can't get anything from here but harm to your­ self, so don't expect it.
I'm taking myself off.
TRACH.
But I'll turn aside your ship from that direction, that you mayn't be off anywhere-stop.
(Stands in front of him, and holds the rope.)GRIP.
If you are the helmsman of this ship, I'll be the pilot.
Let go of the rope now, you villain.
TRACH.
I will let go;
do you let go of the wallet.
GRIP.
I' faith, you shall never this day become a scrap the more wealthy from this.
TRACH.
You cannot convince me by repeatedly denying, unless either a part is given me, or it is referred to arbitra­ tion, or it is placed in safe keeping.
GRIP.
What, that which I got out of the sea?
TRACH.
But I spied it out from the shore.
GRIP.
-With my own pains and labour, and net and boat.
TRACH.
If now the owner, whose property it is, were to come, how am I, who espied from afar that you had taken this, a bit the less the thief than yourself ?
GRIP.
None whatever.
(Going.)TRACK. (seizing the net).
Stop, you whip-knave;
just let me learn of you by what reasoning I am not the sharer, and yet the thief.
GRIP.
I don't know;
neither do I know these city laws of yours, only that I affirm that this is mine.
(Looks at the wallet.)
TRACH.
And I, too, say that it is mine.
GRIP.
Stay now;
I've discovered by what method you may be neither thief nor sharer.
TEACH.
By what method ?
GRIP, Let me go away from here;
you quietly go your own way, and don't you inform against me to any one, and I won't give anything to you.
You hold your tongue;
I'll be mum.
This is the best and the fairest plan.
TRACH.
Well, what proposition do you venture to make ?
GRIP.
I've made it already;
for you to go away, to let go of the rope, and not to be a nuisance to me.
TEACH.
Stop while I propose terms.
GRIP.
I' faith, do, prithee, dispose- of yourself forthwith.
TRACH.
Do you know any one in these parts ?
GRIP.
My own neighbours I must know.
TRACH.
Where do you live here?
GRIP. (pointing).
At a distance out away yonder, as far off as the farthest fields.
TRACH. (pointing to the cottage of DÆMONES).
The person that lives in that cottage, should you like it to be decided by his arbitration ?
GRIP.
Let go of the rope for a moment while I step aside and consider.
TRACH.
Be it so.
(Lets go of the rope.)GRIP. (aside).
Capital, the thing's all right;
the whole of this booty is my own.
He's inviting me here inside of my own abode to my own master as umpire.
By my troth, he never this day will award three obols away from his own servant.
Assuredly, this fellow doesn't know what proposal he has been making.
(To TRACHALIO.)
I'll go to the arbi­ trator with you.
TRACH.
What then?
GRIP.
Although I know for sure that this is my own lawful right, let that be done rather than I should now be fighting with you.
TRACH.
Now you satisfy me.
GRIP.
Although you are driving me before an arbitrator whom I don't know, if he shall administer justice, although he is unknown, he is as good as known to me;
if he doesn't, though known, he is the same as though entirely unknown.
DÆM. (to the WOMEN).
Seriously, upon my faith, young women, although I wish what you desire, I'm afraid that on your account my wife will be turning me out of doors, who'll be saying that I've brought harlots here before her very eyes.
Do you take refuge at the altar rather than II..
THE WOMEN.
We, wretched creatures, are undone.
(They weep.)DiEm.
I'll place you in safety;
don't you fear.
But why (turning to the SERVANTS) are you following me out of doors ?
Since I'm here, no one shall do them harm.
Now then, be off, I say, in-doors, both of you, you guards from off guard. ( They go in.)GRIP.
0 master, save you.
DÆM.
Save you.
How goes it ?
TRACH. (pointing to GRIPUS).
Is he your servant ?
GRIP.
I'm not ashamed to say yes.
TEACH.
I've nothing to do with you.
GRIP.
Then get you gone hence, will you.
TRACH.
Prithee, do answer me, aged sir;
is he your ser­ vant ?
DÆM.
He is mine.
TRACia.
Oh then, that is very good, since he is yours.
Again I salute you.
DÆM.
And I you.
Are you he who, not long since, went away from here to fetch his master ?
TRACH.
I am he.DÆM.
What now is it that you want ?
TRACH. (pointing to GRIPUS).
This is your servant, you say?
DÆM.
He is mine.
TRACH.
That is very good, since he is yours.
DÆM.
What's the matter ?
TRACH. (pointing to GRIPUS).
That's a rascally fellow there.
DÆM.
What has the rascally fellow done to you ?
TRACH.
I wish the ancles of that fellow were smashed.
DÆM.
What's the thing about which you are now disputing between yourselves ?
TRACH.
I'll tell you.
GRIP.
No, I'll tell you.
TRACH.
I fancy I'm to move the matter first.
GRIP.
If indeed you were a decent person, you would be moving yourself off from here.
DÆM.
Gripus, give attention, and hold your tongue.
GRIP.
In order that that fellow may speak first ?
DÆM.
Attend, Itellyou.
(To TRACHALIO.)
Do you say on.
GRIP.
Will you give the right of speaking to a stranger sooner than to your own servant ?
TRACH.
0 dear !
how impossible it is for him to be kept quiet.
As I was beginning to say, that Procurer, whom some little time since you turned out of the Temple of Venus-see (pointing at the wallet), he has got his wallet.
GRIP.
I haven't got it.
TRACH.
Do you deny that which I see with my own eyes ?
GRIP.
But I only wish you couldn't see.
I have got it, and I haven't got it;
why do you trouble yourself about me, what things I do ?
TRACH.
In what way you got it does matter, whether rightfully or wrongfully.
GRIP.
If I didn't take it in the sea, there's not a reason why you shouldn't deliver me up to the cross.
If I took it in the sea with my net, how is it yours rather than my own ?
TRACH. (to DÆMONES).
He is deceiving you;
the matter happened in this way, as I am telling you.
GRIP.
What do you say ?
TRACH.
So long as the per­ son that has the first right to speak is speaking, do (to DÆ­ MONES) put a check on him, please, if he belongs to you.
GRIP.
What, do you wish the same thing to be done to myself, that your master has been accustomed to do to your­ self ?
If he is in the habit of putting a check upon you, this master of ours isn't in the habit of doing so with us.
DÆM. (to TRACHALIO).
In that remark only has he got the betterl of you.
What do you want now ?
Tell me.
TRACK.
For my part, I neither ask for a share of that wallet there, nor have I ever said this day that it is my own;
but in it there is a little casket that belongs to this female (pointing to PALESTRA), whom a short time since I averred to be free born.
DÆM.
You are speaking of her, I suppose, whom a short time since you said was my countrywoman PTRACH.
Just so ;
and those trinkets which formerly, when little, she used to wear, are there in that casket, which is in that wallet.
This thing is of no service to him, and will'be of utility to her, poor creature, if he gives it up, by means of which to seek for her parents.
DÆM.
I'll make him give it up;
hold your tongue.
GRIP.
I' faith, I'm going to give nothing to that fellow.
TEACH.
I ask for nothing but the casket and the trinkets1.
GRIP.
What if they are made of gold PTEACH.
What's that to you ?
Gold shall be paid for gold, silver shall have its weight in silver in return.
GRIP.
Please let me see the gold;
after that I'll let you see the casket.
DÆM. (to GRIPUS).
Do you beware of punishment, and hold your tongue.
(To TRACHALIO.)
As you commenced to speak do you go on.
TEACH.
This one thing I entreat of you, that you will have compassion on this female, if, indeed, this wallet is that Pro­ curer's, which I suspect it is.
In this matter, I'm saying nothing of certainty to you, but only on conjecture.
GRIP.
Do you see how the rascal's wheedling him ?
TEACH.
Allow me to say on as I commenced.
If this is the wallet that belongs to that villain whose I say it is, these women here will be able to recognize it;
order him to show it to them.
GRIP.
Say you so ?
To show it to them ?
DÆM.
He doesn't say unreasonably, Gripus, that the wallet should be shown.
GRIP.
Yes, i' faith, confoundedly unreasonably.
DÆM.
How so ?
GRIP.
Because, if I do show it, at once they'll say, of course, that they recognize it.
TRACH.
Source of villany, do you suppose that all other people are just like yourself, you author of perjury ?
GRIP.
All this I easily put up with, so long as he (point­ ing to DÆMONES) is of my way of thinkingl.
TRACH.
But now he is against you ;
from this (pointing to the wallet) will he obtain true testimony.
DÆM.
Gripus, do you pay attention.
(To TRACHALIO.)
You explain in a few words what it is you want ?
TRACH.
For my part, I have stated it;
but if you haven't understood me, I'll state it over again.
Both of these women (pointing to them), as I said a short time since, ought to be free ;
(pointing to PALÆSTRA) she was stolen at Athens when a little girl.
GRIP.
Tell me what that has got to do with the wallet, whether they are slaves or whether free women ?
TRACH.
You wish it all to be told over again, you rascal, so that the day may fail us.
DÆM.
Leave off your abuse, and explain to me what I've been asking.
TEACH.
There ought to be a casket of wicker-works in that wallet, in which are tokens by means of which she may be enabled to recognize her parents, by whom, when little, she was lost at Athens, as I said before.
GRIP.
May Jupiter and the Gods confound you.
What do you say, you sorcerer of a fellow ?
What, are these wo­ men dumb, that they are not able to speak for themselves ?
TEACH.
They are silent for this reason, because a silent woman is always better than a talking one.
GRIP.
Then, i' faith, by your way of speaking, you are neither a man nor a woman to my -notion.
TRACH.
How so ?
GRIP.
Why, because neither talking nor silent are you ever good for anything.
Prithee (to DÆ­ MONES), shall I ever be allowed to-day to speak ?
DÆM.
If you utter a single word more this day, I'll break your head for you.
TRACH.
As I had commenced to say it, old gentleman, IF beg you to order him to give up that casket to these young women;
if for it he asks any reward for himself, it shall be paid;
whatever else is there besides, let him keep for himself.
GRIP.
Now at last you say that, because you are aware it is my right;
just now you were asking to go halves.
TEACH.
Aye, and even still I ask it.
GRIP.
I've seen a kite making a swoop, even when he got nothing at all however.
DÆM. (to GRIPus).
Can't I shut your mouth without a drubbing ?
GRIP. (pointing to TRACHALIO).
If that fellow is silent, I'll be silent;
if he talks, allow me to talk in my own behalf.
DiEm.
Please now give me this wallet, Gripus.
GRIP.
I'll trust it to you ;
but for you to return it me, if there are none of those things in it.
DÆM.
It shall be returned.
GRIP.
Take it.
(Gives him the wallet.)DÆM.
Now then listen, Palæstra and Ampelisca, to this which I say:
is this the wallet, in which this Procurer said that your casket was ?
PAL.
It is the same.
GRIP. (aside).
Troth, to my sorrow, l'in undone ;
how on the instant, before she well saw it, she said that it was it.
PAL.
I'll make this matter plain to you, instead of difficult.
There ought to be a casket of wicker-work there in that wallet;
whatever is in there I'll state by name ;
don't you show me anything.
If I say wrong, I shall then have said this to no purpose;
then you shall keep these things, what­ ever is in there for yourselves.
But if the truth, then I en­ treat you that what is my own may be restored to me.
DÆM.
I agree ;
you ask for bare justice only, in my way of thinking, at least.
GRIP.
But, i' faith, in mine, for extreme injustice;
what ii she is a witch or a sorceress, and shall mention exactly everything that's in it ?
Is a sorceress to have it ?DÆM.
She shan't get it, unless she tells the truth;
in vair will she1 be conjuring.
Unloose the wallet, then (giving it to GRIPUS), that as soon as possible I may know what is the truth.
GRIP.
(first unfastens the straps of the wallet, and then hands it to his MASTER).
Take it2, it's unfastened.
(DÆMONES takes out the casket.)
Alas, I'm undone ;
I see the casket.
DÆM. (holding it up, and addressing PALÆSTRA).
Is this it ?PAL.
That is it.
0 my parents, here do I keep you locked up;
here have I enclosed both my wealth and my hopes of recognizing you.
GRIP. (aside).
Then, by my faith, the Gods must be enraged with you, whoever you are, who fasten up your parents in so narrow a compass.
DÆM.
Gripus, come hither, your cause is being tried.
(To PALESTRA.)
Do you, young woman, away at a distance there say what's in it, and of what appearance ;
mention them all.
By my troth, if you make ever so slight a mistake, even if afterwards you wish, madam, to correct yourself, you'll be making a great mistake.
GRIP.
You demand what's real justice.
TRACH.
By my troth, then, he doesn't demand yourself;
for you are the op­ posite of justice.
DÆM.
Now then, say on, young woman.
Gripus, give at­ tention and hold your tongue.
PAL.
There are some trinkets.
DÆM. (looking in the casket).
See, here they are, I espy them.
GRIP. (aside).
In the first onset I an.
worsted;
(takes hold of the arm of DÆMONES) hold, don't be showing.
DÆM.
Of what description are they ?
Answer in their order.
PAL.
In the first place, there's a little sword of gold, with an inscription.
DÆM.
Just tell me, what the characters are upon that little sword.
PAL.
The name of my father.
Next, on the other side, there's a little two-edged axe, of gold likewise, with an inscription:
there on the axe is the name of my mother.
DÆM.
Stay ;
tell me, what's the name of your father upon the little sword ?
PAL.
Dæmones.
DÆM. Immortal Gods!
where in the world are my hopes PGRIP.
Aye, by my troth, and where are mine ?
DÆM.
Do proceed forthwith, I entreat you.
GRIP.
Cautiously, or else (aside) away to utter perdition.
DÆM.
Say, what's the name of your mother, here upon the little axe ?
PAL.
Dædalis.
DÆM.
The Gods will that I should be pre­ served.
GRIP.
But that I should be ruined.
DÆM.
This must be my own daughter, Gripus.
GRIP.
She may be for me, indeed.
(To TRACHALIO.)
May all the Gods confound you who this day saw me with your eyes, and myself as well for a blockhead, who didn't look about a hundred times first to see that no one was watching me, before I drew the net out of the water.
PAL.
Next, there's a little knife of silver, and two little hands linked together, and then a little sow.
GRIP. (aside).
Nay, then, go and be hanged, you with your little sow and with your little pigs.
PAL.
There's also a golden drop1, which my father pre­ sented to me upon my birthday.
DÆM.
Undoubtedly there is;
but I cannot restrain myself any longer from embracing you.
My daughter, blessings on you;
I am that father who begot you;
I am Dæmones, and see, your mother Dædalis is in the house here (pointing to his cottage).
AMP. (embracing him).
Blessings on you, my unlooked­ for father.
DÆM.
Blessings on you;
how joyously do I embrace you.
TRACH.
'Tis a pleasure to me, inasmuch as this falls to your lot from your feelings of affection.
DÆM.
Come then, Trachalio, if you can, bring that wallet into the house.
TRACH. (taking the wallet).
See the villany of Gripus ;
inasmuch, Gripus, as this matter has turned out unfortu­ nately for you, I congratulate you.
DÆM.
Come, then, let's go, my daughter, to your mother, who will be better able to enquire of you into this matter from proofs;
who had you more in her hands, and is more thoroughly acquainted with your tokens.
TRACH.
Let's all go hence in-doors, since we are giving our common aid.
PAL.
Follow me, Ampelisca.
AMP.
That the Gods favour you, it is a pleasure to me.
( They all go into the cottage of DÆMONES, except GRIPUS.)GRIP. (to himself).
Am I not a blockhead of a fellow, to have this day fished up that wallet ?
Or, when I had fished it up, not to have hidden it somewhere in a secret spot ?
By my troth, I guessed that it would be a troublesome booty for me, because it fell to me in such troublous weather.
I' faith, I guess that there's plenty of gold and silver there.
What is there better for me than to be off hence in-doors and secretly hang myself-at least for a little time, until this vexation passes away from me ?
(Goes into the cottage.)DÆM. (to himself.)
0 ye immortal Gods, what person is there more fortunate than I, who unexpectedly have discovered my daughter ?
Isn't it the fact, that if the Gods will a blessing to befall any person, that longed-for pleasure by some means or other, falls to the lot1 of the virtuous ?
I this day, a thing that I never hoped for nor yet believed, have unexpectedly discovered my daughter, and I shall bestow her upon a re­ spectable young man of noble family, an Athenian, and my kinsman.
For that reason I wish him to be fetched hither to me as soon as possible, and I've requested my servant to come out here, that he may go to the Forum.
Still, I'm surprised at it that he isn't yet come out.
I think I'll go to the door.
(Opens the door, and looks in.)
What do I behold ?
Embracing her, my wife is clasping my daughter around her neck.
Her caressing is really almost too foolish and sicken­ ing2.
(Goes to the door again, and calls out.)
'Twere better, wife, for an end to be made at last of your kissing;
and make all ready that I may perform a sacrifice, when I come in-doors, in honor of the household Gods, inasmuch as they have increased our family.
At home I have lambs and swine for sacred use.
But why, ladies, are you detaining that Trachalio ?
Oh, I see he's coming out of doors, very seasonably.
TRACH, (speaking to those within).
Wheresoever he shall be, I'll seek Plesidippus out at once, and bring him together with me to you.
DÆM.
Tell him how this matter has fallen out about my daughter.
Request him to leave other occupations and to come here.
TEACH.
Very wells.
DÆM.
Tell him that I'll give him my daughter for a wife.
TRACH.
Very well.
DÆM.
And that I knew his father, and that he is a relation of my own.
TEACH.
Very well.
DÆM.
But do make haste.
TRACH.
Very well.
DÆM.
Take care and let a dinner be prepared here at once.
TRACH.
Very well.
DÆM.
What, all very well ?
TRACH.
Very well.
But do you know what it is I want of you ?
That you'll remember what you promised, that this day I'm to be free.
DÆM.
Very welll.
TRACH.
Take care and entreat Plesi­ dippus to give me my freedom.
DÆM.
Very well.
TEACH.
And let your daughter re­ quest it;
she'll easily prevail.
DÆM.
Very well.
TRACK.
And that Ampelisca may marry me, when I'm a free man..
DAM.
Very well.
TRACH.
And that I may experience a pleasing return to myself in kindness for my actions.
DiEM. Very well.
TEACH.
What, all very well ?
DÆM.
Very well.
Again I return you thanks.
But do you make haste to proceed to the city forthwith, and betake yourself hither again.
TRACH.
Very well.
I'll be here directly.
In the mean­ while, do you make the other preparations that are neces­ sary.
(Exit TRACHALIO.DÆM.
Very well-may Hercules ill befriend him with his “ very-welling2 he has so stuffed my ears with it.
What­ ever it was I said, " very well" was the answer.
GRIP.
How soon may I have a word with you, Dæmones ?
DÆM.
What's your business, Gripus ?
GRIP.
Touching that wallet, if you are wise, be wise;
keep what goods the Gods provide you.
DÆM.
Does it seem right to you, that, what belongs to another I should assert to be my own ?
GRIP.
What, not a thing that I found in the sea ?
DÆM.
So much the better does it happen for him who lost it;
none the more is it necessary that it should be your wallet.
GRIP.
For this reason are you poor, because you are too scrupulously righteous.
DiEM. 0 Gripus, Gripus, in the life of man very many traps there are, in what they are deceived by guile.
And, by my troth, full often is a bait placed in them, which bait if any greedy person greedily snaps at, through his own greedi­ ness he is caught in the trap.
He who prudently, skilfully, and warily, takes precaution, full long he may enjoy that which is honestly acquired.
This booty seems to me1 to be about to be made a booty of by me, that it may go hence with a greater blessing than itfirst came.
What, ought I to con­ ceal what I know was brought to me as belonging to an­ other ?
By no means will my friend Dæmones do that.
'Tis ever most becoming for prudent men to be on their guard against this, that they be not themselves confederates with their servants in evil-doing.
Except only when I'm gaming, I don't care for any gain.
GRIP.
At times, I've seen the Comedians, when acting, in this fashion repeat sayings in a wise manner, and be ap­ lauded for them, when they pointed out this prudent con­ duct to the public.
But when each person went thence his own way home, there wasn't one after the fashion which they had recommended.
DÆM.
Go in-doors, don't be troublesome, moderate your tongue.
I'm going to give you nothing, don't you deceive yourself.
GRIP. (apart).
Then I pray the Gods that whatever'a in that wallet, whether it's gold, or whether silver, it may all become ashes.
(Goes into the cottage.)DÆM.
This is the reason why we have bad servants.
For this master, if he had combined with any servant, would have made both himself and the other guilty of a theft.
While he was thinking that he himself had made a capture, in the meantime he himself would have been made a capture :
cap­ ture would have led to capture.
Now will I go in-doors from here and sacrifice;
after that, I'll at once order the dinner to be cooked for us.
Goes into the cottage.)

(They go into the cottage of DÆMONES.)LAB. (to himself).
What other mortal being is there living this day more wretched than myself, whom before the commis­ sioned judges2 Plesidippus has just now cast ?
Palæstra has just been taken from me by award.
I'm ruined outright.
But I do believe that Procurers were procreated for mere sport;
so much do all persons make sport if any misfortune befalls a Procurer.
Now I'll go look here, in the Temple of Venus, for that other female, that her at least I may take away, the only portion of my property that remains.
(He retires a little distance.)GRIP. (calling to the PEOPLE within).
By the powers, you shall never this day at nightfall behold Gripus alive, unless the wallet is restored to, me.
LAB. (bekind).
I'm ready to die;
when I hear mention made anywhere of a wallet, I'm thumped, as it were with a stake, upon the breast.
GRIP, (at the door, continuing).
That scoundrel is free ;
I, the person that held the net in the sea, and drew up the wallet, to him you refuse to give anything.
LAB. (behind), 0 ye immortal Gods!
by his talk this person has made me prick up my ears.
GRIP. (continuing).
By my troth, in letters a cubit long, I'll immediately post it up in every quarter, “ If any person has lost a wallet with plenty of gold and silver, let him come to Gripus."
You shan't keep it as you are wishing.
LAB. (behind).
I' faith, this person knows, as I think, who has got the wallet.
This person must be accosted by me;
ye Gods, aid me, I do entreat you.
GRIP.
Why are you calling me back in-doors ?
(He rubs away at the spit.)
I want to clean this here before the door.
But surely this, i' faith, has been made of rust, and not of iron;
so that the more I rub it, it becomes quite red and more slender.
Why surely this spit has been druggedl;
it does waste away so in my hands.
LAB. (accosting him).
Save you, young man.
GRIP.
May the Gods prosper you with your shorn pate2.
LAB.
What's going on ?
GRIP.
A spit being cleaned.
GRIP.
What are you ?
Prithee, are you a medicant3 ?
LAB.
No, i' faith, I am more than a medicant by one letter.
GRIP.
Then you are a " mendicant."LAB.
You've hit it to a nicety4.
GRIP.
Your appearance seems suitable to it.
But what's the matter with you ?
LAB.
Troth, this last night I was shipwrecked at sea the vessel was cast away, and to my misfortune I lost there everything that I had.
GRIP.
What did you lose ?
LAB.
A wallet with plenty of gold and silver.
GRIP.
Do you at all remember what there was in the wallet which was lost P LAB.
What matters for us now to be talk.
ing of it, if, in spite of it, it's lost ?
GRIP.
What if I know who has found it ?
I wish to learn from you the tokens.
LAB.
Eight hundred golden pieces were there in a purse, besides a hundred Philippean minæ in a wash-leather bag apart.
GRIP. (aside).
Troth, it is a noble prize ;
I shall be get­ ting a handsome reward.
The Gods show respect to mor­ tals ;
therefore I shall come off bounteously rewarded.
No doubt, it is this man's wallet.
(To LABRAX.)
Do you pro­ ceed to relate the rest.
LAB.
A large talent of silver of full weight was in a purse, besides a bowl, a goblet, a beaker, a boat, and a cup.
GRIP.
Astonishing!
you really did have some splendid riches.
LAB.
A shocking expression is that, and a most abominable one.
“ You did have, and now have not."GRIP.
What would you be ready to give to one who should find these out for you, and give you information ?
Say, speedily and at once.
LAB.
Three hundred didrachms.
GRIP.
Rubbish.
LAB.
Four hundred.
GRIP.
Old thrums.
LAB.
Five hundred.
GRIP.
A rotten nut.
LAB.
Six hundred.
GRIP.
You are prating about mere tiny weevils.
LAB.
I'll give seven hundred.
GRIP.
Your mouth is hot, you are cooling it1 just now.
LAB.
I'll give a thousand didrachms.
GRIP.
You are dreaming.
LAB.
I add no more;
be off with you.
GRIP.
Hear me then;
if, i' faith, I should be off from here, I shan't be here.
LAB.
Would you like a hundred as well as the thousand ?
GRIP.
You are asleep.
LAB.
Say how much you ask.
GRIP.
That you mayn't be adding anything against your inclination, a great talent;
it's not possible for three obols to be bated thence;
then do you say either “yes” or “no” at once.
LAB. (aside).
What's to be done here ?
It's a matter of necessity, I see :
(to GRIPUS) the talent shall be paid.
GRIP.
(going towards the altar).
Just step this way;
I wish Venus here to put the question to you.
LAB.
Whatever you please, that command me.
GRIP.
Touch this altar of Venus.
LAB.
(touching it).
I am touching it.
GRIP.
By Venus here must you swear to me.
LAB.
What must I swear ?
GRIP.
What I shall bid you.
LAB.
Dictate in words just as you like.
(Aside.)
What I've got at home, I shall never beg1 of any one else.
GRIP.
Take hold of this altar.
LAB.
(taking hold of it).
I am taking hold of it.
GRIP.
Swear that you will pay me the money on that same day on which you shall gain possession of the wallet.
LAB.
Be it so.
GRIP.
(speaking, while LABRAX repeats after him).
Venus of Cyrene, I invoke thee as my witness, if I shall find that wallet which I lost in the ship, safe with the gold and silver, and it shall come into my possession—GRIP. “
Then to this Gripus do I promise ;
” say so and place your hand upon me.
LAB.
Then to this Gripus do I promise, Venus, do thou hear meGRIP. (followed by LABRAX). "
That I will forthwith give him a great talent of silver."
GRIP.
If you defraud me, say, may Venus utterly destroy your body, and your existence in your calling.
(Aside.)
As it is, do you have this for yourself, when you've once taken the oath.
LAB.
If, Venus, I shall do anything amiss against this oath, I supplicate thee that all Procurers may henceforth be wretched.
GRIP. (aside).
As it is, it shall be so, even if you do keep your oath.
Do you wait here;
(going towards the cottage)— I'll at once make the old gentleman come out;
do you forth­ with demand of him that wallet.
(Goes in.)LAB. (to himself).
If ever so much he shall restore to me this wallet, I'm not this day indebted to him three obols even.
It's according to my own intention what my tongue swears.
(The door opens.)
But I'll hold my peace;
see, here he's coming out, and bringing the old man.
GRIP.
Follow this way.
Where is this Procurer ?
Hark you (to LABRAX), see now;
this person (pointing at DÆ­ MONES) has got your wallet.
DÆM.
I have got it, and I confess that it is in my posses­ sion ;
and if it's yours, you may have it.
Everything, just as each particular was in it, shall in like manner be given safe to you.
(Holding it out.)
Take it, if it's yours.
LAB.
Immortal Gods, it is mine.
(Takes it.)
Welcome, dear wallet.
DÆM.
Is it yours ?
LAB.
Do you ask the question ?
If indeed, i'faith, it were in Jove's possession, still it is my own..DÆM.
Everything in it is safe;
there has only been one casket taken out of it, with some trinkets, by means of which this day I have found my daughter.
LAB.
What person ?
DÆM. Palæstra, who was your pro­ perty, she has been discovered to be my own daughter.
LAB.
By my troth, it has happily turned out so;
since this matter has happened so fortunately for you according to your wishes, I'm rejoiced.
DÆM.
In that I don't readily believe you.
LAB.
Aye, by my faith, that you may be sure that I'm rejoiced, you shan't give me three obols for her;
I excuse you.
DÆM.
I' faith, you are acting kindly.
LAB.
No, troth ;
it's really yourself, indeed, that's doing (Going off with the wallet.)GRIP.
Hark you, you've got the wallet now.
LAB.
I have got it.
GRIP.
Make haste.
LAB.
Make haste about what?
GRIP.
To pay me the money.
LAB.
By my troth, I'll neither give you anything nor do I owe you anything.
GRIP.
What mode of proceeding is this ?
Don't you owe it me ?
LAB.
Troth, not I indeed.
GRIP.
Didn't you promise it me upon your oath ?
LAB.
I did take an oath, and now I'll take an oath, if it is in any way my own pleasure oaths were invented for preserv­ ing property, not for losing it.
GRIP.
Give me,will you, a great talent of silver, you most perjured fellow.
DÆM.
Gripus, what talent is it you are asking him for ?
GRIP.
He promised it me on oath.
LAB.
I chose to swear;
(turning to DÆMONES) are you the priestl as to my perjury ?DÆM. (to GRIPUS).
For what reason did he promise you the money ?
GRIP.
If I restored this wallet into his hands, he swore that he would give me a great talent of silver.
LAB.
Find me a person with whom I may go to the judge, to decide whether you did not make the bargain with wicked fraudulence, and whether I am yet five-and-twenty years old2.
GRIP. (pointing to DÆMONES).
Go to the judge with him.
LAB.
No ;
I must have some other person.
DÆM. (to LABRAX).
Then I shan't allow you to take it away from him, unless I shall have found him guilty.
Did you promise him the money ?
LAB.
I c. less it.
DÆM.
What you promised my slave must needs be my own.
Don't you be.
supposing, Pro­ curer, that you are to be using your pimping honesty here.
That can't be.
GRIP. (to LABRAX).
Did you fancy now that you had got hold of a person whom you might cheat ?
It must be paid down here (holding his hand), good silver coin;
I shall, at once, pay it to him (pointing to DÆMONES), so that he may give me my liberty.
DÆM.
Inasmuch, therefore, as I have acted courteously towards you, and by my means these things (pointing to the wallet) have been saved for youGRIP.
I' faith, by my means, rather;
don't say by yours.
DÆM. (to GRIPUS).
If you are prudent you'll hold your tongue.
(To LABRAX.)
Then it befits you in a like cour­ teous manner kindly to return the obligation to myself, who so well merit the same.
LAB.
You are pleading, of course, for my right ?DÆM. (ironically).
It would be a wonder if I didn't, at a loss to myself, ask you to forego your right.
GRIP, (aside).
I'm all right;
the Procurer's giving way;
my freedom is at hand..DEM. (pointing to GRIPUS).
He found this wallet;
he is my slave.
I therefore have preserved this for you, together with a large sum of money.
LAB.
I return you thanks, and with regard to the talent that I promised on oath to him, there's no reason that you shouldn't receive it.
GRIP.
Hark you, give it me then, if you are wise.
DÆM. (to GRIPUS).
Will you hold your tongue, or not ?
GRIP.
You pretend to be acting on my side :
I tell you * * * * * * by my troth, you shan't do me out of that, if I did lose the other bootyl.
DÆM.
You shall have a beating if you add a single word.
GRIP.
Troth now, do you kill me even ;
I'll never be silent on any terms, unless my mouth is shut with the talentLAB.
For yourself, in fact, is he using his exertions;
do hold your tongue.
DÆM.
Step this way, Procurer.
LAB.
Very well.
(They walk on one side.)GRIP.
Proceed openly;
I don't want any whisperings or mumblings to be going on.
DÆM.
Tell me, at what price did you buy that other young woman, Ampelisca ?
LAB.
I paid down a thousand didrachms.
DÆM.
Should you like me to make you a handsome offer PLAB.
I should like it much.
DÆM. I'll divide the talent.
LAB.
You act fairly.
DÆM.
For that other woman Ampelisca, that she may be free, take you one half, and give the other half to him.
LAB.
By all means.
DÆM.
For that half I'll give his freedom to Gripus, by means of whom you found your wallet, and I my daughter.
LAB.
You act fairly;
I return you many thanks.
(They return to GRIPUS.)GRIP.
How soon then is the money to be returned to me PDÆM.
The money's paid, Gripus ;
I've got it.
GRIP.
You, faith;
but I had rather it were myself.
DÆM.
I' faith, there's nothing for you here, so don't you De expecting it.
I wish you to release him from his oath.
GRIP. (aside.)
Troth, I'm undone;
if I don't hang myself1, I'm utterly done for.
(Aloud.)
I' faith, after this day you certainly shall never be cheating me again.
DÆM.
Dine here to-day, Procurer.
LAB.
Be it so;
the proposal is to my taste.
DÆM.
Do you both follow me in-doors.
(He comes forward and addresses the AUDIENCE.)
Spectators, I would invite you to dinner as well, were it not that I'm going to give nothing, and that there is no good cheer at all at home;
and if, too, I didn't believe that you are invited to dinner elsewhere.
But if you shall be willing to give hearty applause to this Play, do you all come to make merry at my house some sixteen years hence.
Do you (to LABRAX and GEIPUS) both dine here with me to-day.
GRIP.
Be it so.
Give to your applause)—Ver. 1423.
This Play, though pronounced to be one of the best of this author, does not conclude satisfactorily.
We are not told what becomes of Ampelisca, or of Trachalio, who aspires to the honor of her hand.

and Dæmones loses all claim to our estimation, by inviting such an infamous villain as Labrax to take a place at his table, who certainly, according to the usual les of Dramatic retribution, richly dukevres to lose his wallet anu its contentsDEMIPHO, an aged Athenian.

Scene.
—Athens;
before the houses of LYSIMACHUS and DEMIPHO which are adjacent to each other.
THIS Play (which is thought by some not to have been the composition of Plautus) describes the follies of a vicious old man and his son.
Two years before th< period when the Play opens, Charinus has been sent by his father Demipho to traffic at Rhodes.
Returning thence, he brings with him a young woman, named Pasicompsa, who is in reality his mistress, but whom he pretends to have pur­ shased for the purpose of her being an attendant upon his mother.
Demipho, in the absence of his son, goes down to the ship, and seeing the young woman there, falls desperately in love with her.
He then pretends to Charinus that she is too hand­ some to be brought into the house as a servant, and that she must be sold again.
Insisting upon this.
he persuades his friend, Lysimachus, to purchase her for him in his own name, and to take her to his own house.
This being done, and the damsel brought to the house, the wife of Lysimachus unexpectedly returns home from the country, and finds her there.
In the meanwhile, Charinus, being reduced to despair on losing his mistress, determines to leave the coun­ try.
His friend Eutychus, the son of Lysimachus, having discovered his friend's mistress in his father's house, stops him just as be is about -to depart, and informs him where she has been found.
He then reconciles his own parents, and the Play concludes with his very just censure of Demipho for his conduct.
A YOUNG man, being sent (Missus) by his father to traffic, buys (Emit) a dam­ set of remarkable beauty, and brings her home.
The old man, after he has seen her, makes enquiry (Requirit) who she is.
The servant pretends (Con­ fingit) that she has been bought by the son as an attendant for his mother.
The old man falls in love with (Amat) her, and pretending that he has sold her, gives her in the charge of (Tradit) his neighbour.
His wife thinks that he has brought (Obduxe) a mistress home.
Then his friend stops (Retrahit) Cha­ rinus in his flight, after he has discovered his mistress.
Two things have I now resolved to do at the same time;
both the subject and my own amours will I disclose.
I am not doing like as I have seen other lovers do in Come­ dies, who relate their woes either to the night or to the day, or to the Sun or to the Moon;
who, faith, I don't suppose pay much regard to the complaints of mortals, either what they wish or what they don't wish.
To yourselves in preference will I now relate my woes.
In the Greek this Play is called the Emporos 1 of Philemon;
the same in the Latin is the Mer­ cator of Marcus Accius.
My father sent me hence to trade at Rhodes.
Two years have now passed since I left home.
There I began to love a fair one of remarkable beauty.
But how I was captivated by her, I'll tell you, if you'll lend ear, and if you'll have the kindness to give your attention to this.
And yet in this, but little have I followed the method of our forefathers in my own person, and on the spot as a tell-tale 1 of my own amours am I represented before you.
But all these fail­ ings are wont to attend on love-care, trouble, and refinement overmuch.
Not only him who loves, but every one to whom this latter fault extends, him with a great and weighty evil does it affect;
nor by my troth, in fact, does any one aim at refinement, beyond what his means allow of, without heavy disaster.
But to love as well are these evils incident, which I have not as yet recounted-sleeplessness, a troubled mind, confusion, terror, and apprehension, trifling, and folly even, rashness too, thoughtlessness, foolhardy impudence, wanton­ ness, lust, and malevolence;
covetousness is inherent as well, idleness, injustice, want, contumely and wastefulness, talkative­ ness or moody silence.
This latter is the fact, because things which relate not to the purpose, nor are of utility, the same does the lover give utterance to full oft at an unseasonable moment;
and yet again, this moody silence for this reason do I commend, because no lover is ever so skilled in eloquence, as to be en­ abled to give utterance to that which is for his own interest.
You, then, must not be offended with myself for my babbling;
Venus bestowed it upon me on that same day on which this passion.
To that point am I resolved to return, that what I commenced upon I may disclose.
In the first place, when in life I had passed from my boyish days, and my disposition was weaned from childish pursuits, I began distractedly to love a Courtesan in this place.
Forthwith, unknown to my father, my means went to be wasted upon her;
an exacting Procurer, the owner of this damsel, by every method that he could, grasped everything into his own possession2.
Night and day my father censured me for this;
represented the perfidy, the wickedness of Procurers;
how that his own property was being forcibly rent in pieces, while that of this Procurer was increasing;
this too in the loudest tones;
sometimes mutter­ ing to himself;
refusing to speak to me ;
even denying that I was his child ;
crying aloud through all the city and proclaim­ ing that all should withhold from trusting me when desiring to borrow;
that love had allured many a one to ruin;
that I, passing all bounds, regardless of decency, and acting wrong­ fully, laid hands upon and tore whatever I could from him at home;
that 'twas a most vile system that those choice possessions which he, by enduring every hardship, had acquired, should all be squandered away and parted with through the violence of my desire.
That now for so many years he had supported myself, a reproach to him;
that were I not ashamed, I ought not to desire to live.
That he himself, at the very moment after he had passed his boyish days, did not, like me, devote his attention to love or indolence in slothfulness, nor, indeed, had he the control of himself, so very strictly by his father was he held in check ;
that in the various sordid pur­ suits of the country he was employed, and that only every fifth year even was he then enabled to visit the city, and that im mediately after he had had a sight of the Festival 1, back again instantly into the country was he wont to be driven by his father.
That there by far the most of all the household did he toil, while thus his father would say to him:
"
For yourself you are ploughing, for yourself you harrow, for your­ self you sow, for your own self too do you reap;
for yourself, in fine, will this labour be productive of happiness."
That after life had left his father's body, he had sold the farm, and with that money had bought for himself a bark of fifteen tons2, and with the same had transported merchandize to every quarter, even until he had acquired the property which he then possessed.
That I ought to do the same, if I would be as it behoved me to be.
I, when I found that I was disliked by my father and was an object of hate to him whom I was bound to please, distracted and in love as I was, resolutely made up my mind.
I said that I would go to traffic, if he pleased;
that I would renounce my amour, so as to be obe­ dient to him.
He gave me thanks, and praised my good feeling, but failed not to exact my promise;
he built a mer­ chant-ship1, and purchased merchandize;
the ship ready, he placed it on board;
besides, to myself with his own hand hepaid down a talent of silver;
with me he sent a servant, who formerly had been my tutor from the time when I was a little child, to be as though a guardian to me.
These things completed, we set sail;
we came to Rhodes, where the mer­ chandize which I had brought I sold to my mind according as I wished;
I made great profits, beyond the estimate of the merchandize which my father had given me;
and so I made a large sum.
But while in the harbour I was walking there, a certain stranger recognized me, and invited me to dinner.
I went, and took my place at table, being merrily and hand­ somely entertained.
When at night we went to rest, behold, a female came to me, than whom not another female is there more charming.
That night, by order of my entertainer, did she pass with me;
consider your own selves, how very much he gratified me.
Next day, I went to my host;
I begged him to sell her to me;
I said that for his kindnesses I should ever be grateful and obliged.
What need is there of talking ?
I bought her, and yesterday I brought her hither.
I don't wish my father to come to know I've brought her.
For the present, I've left her and a servant in the harbour on board the ship.
But why do I see my servant running hither from the harbour, whom I forbade to leave the ship ?
I dread what the reason may be.
(Stands aside.)AcAN. (to himself).
With your utmost power and might always try and endeavour that your younger master!!
may by your aid be preserved.
Come. then, Acanthio, away with weariness from you;
take care and be on your guard against sloth.
At the same time put an end to this panting;
troth, I can hardly fetch my breath;
at the same time, too, drive right full against all those persons who come in the way, shove them aside, and push them into the road.
This custom here is a very bad one;
no one thinks it proper for him to give way to one who is running and in haste ;
and thus three things must be done at the same moment, when you have commenced upon but one;
you must both run and fight, and squabble as well, upon the road.
CHAR. (apart).
What's the reason of this, that he'a re­ quiring speed for himself at a rate so rapid ?
I have some anxiety, what the business is, or what news he brings.
ACAN. (to himself).
I'm trifling about it.
The more I stop, the greater the risk that's run.
CHAB. (apart).
He brings news of some misfortune, I know not what.
ACAN. (to himself).
His knees are failing this runner.
I'm undone, my spleen is in rebellion 1, it's taking possession of my breast.
I'm done up, I can't draw my breath.
A very worthless piper should I be.
I' faith, not all the baths will ever remove this lassitude from me.
Am I to say that my master Charinus is at home or abroad ?CHAR. (apart).
I'm doubtful in my mind what the matter is ;
I'd like for myself to learn of him, that I may become acquainted with it.
AcAN. (to himself).
But why still standing here ?
Why still hesitating to make splinters of this door ?
(Knocks at the door of DEMIPHO'S house, and calls.)
Open the door, some one.
Where's my master, Charinus ?
Is he at home or abroad P Does any one think fit to come to the door ?
CHAR. (-presenting himself).
Why, here am I, whom you're looking for, Acanthio.
ACAN. (not seeing him).
There is nowhere a more lazy management than in his house.
CHAR.
What matter is afflicting you so terribly ?
ACAN. (turning round).
Many, master, both yourself and me.
CHAR.
What's the matter ?
ACAN.
We are undone.
CHAR.
That beginning do you present unto our foes.
ACAN.
But your own self it has befallen, as fate would have it.
CHAR.
Tell me this matter, whatever it is.
ACAN.
Quietly—I want to take a rest.
(He pants.)CHAR.
But, i' faith, do take the skirt of your coat 1, and wipe the sweat from off you.
ACAN.
For your sake, I've burst the veins of my lungs;
I'm spitting blood already.
(He spits.)CHAR.
Swallow Ægyptian resin with honey;
you'll make it all right.
AcAN.
Then, i' faith, do you drink hot pitch2;
then your troubles will vanish.
CHAR.
I know no one a more tetchy fellow than yourself.
ACAN.
And I know no one more abusive than yourself.
CHAR.
But what if l'in persuading you to that which I take to be for your benefit ?
ACAN.
Away with benefit of that sort, that's accompanied with pain.
CHAR.
Tell me, is there any good at all that any one can enjoy entirely without evil;
or where you mustn't endure labour when you wish to enjoy it ?
•ACAN.
I don't understand these things ;
I never learnt to philosophize, and don't know how.
I don't want any good to be given me, to which evil is an accompaniment.
CHAR. (extending his hand).
Come now, Acanthio, give me your right hand.
ACAN.
It shall be given;
there then, take it.
( Gives his hand.)CHAR.
Do you intend yourself to be obedient to me, or don't you intend it ?
ACAN.
You may judge by experience, as I've ruptured my­ self with running for your sake, in order that what I knew, you might have the means of knowing directly.
CHAR.
I'll make you a free man within a few months.
ACAN.
You are smoothing me down.
CHAR.
What, should I presume ever to make mention of an untrue thing to you ?
On the contrary, before I said so, you knew already whether I intend to utter an untruth.
ACAN.
Ah!
your words, upon my faith, are increasing my weakness.
You are worrying me to death!
CHAR.
What, is this the way you're obedient to ine ?
ACAN.
What do you want me to do ?
CHAR.
What, you ?
What I want is thisACAN.
What is it then that you do want ?
CHAR.
I'll tell you.
ACAN.
Tell me, then.
CHAR.
But still, I'd like to do it in a quiet way.
ACAN.
Are you afraid lest you should wake the drowsy Spectatorsl from their nap ?
CHAR.
Woe be to you!
ACAN.
For my part, that same am I bringing to you from the harbour.
CHAR.
What are you bringing ?
Tell me.
ACAN.
Violence, alarm, torture, care, strife, and beggary.
CHAR.
I'm undone!
You really are bringing me hither a store of evils.
I'm ruined outright.
ACAN.
Why, yes, you areCHAR.
I know it already;
you'll be saying I'm wretched.
ACAN.
'Tis you have said so ;
I'm mum.
CHAR.
What mishap is this ?
ACAN.
Don't enquire.
It is a very great calamity.
CHAR.
Prithee, do relieve me at once.
Too long a time have I been in suspense.
ACAN.
Softly;
I still wish to make many enquiries before I'm beaten.
CHAR.
By my troth, you assuredly will be beaten, unless you say at once, or get away from here.
ACAN.
Do look at that, please, how he does coax me;
there's no one more flattering when he sets about it.
CHAR.
By heavens, I do entreat and beseech you to dis­ close to me at once what it is;
inasmuch as I see that I must be the suppliant of my own servant.
ACAN.
And do I seem so unworthy of it ?
CHAR.
Oh no, quite worthy.
ACAN.
Well, so I thought.
CHAR.
Prithee, is the ship lost ?
ACAN.
The ship's all right;
don't fear about that.
CHAR.
Well then, the rest of the cargo ?
ACAN.
That's right and tight.
CHAR.
Why then don't you tell me what it is, for which, just now, running through the city, you were seeking me ?
ACAN.
Really, you are taking the words out of my mouth.
CHAR.
I'll hold my tongue.
ACAN.
Do hold your tongue.
I doubt, if I brought you any good news, you'd be dreadfully pressing, who are now insisting upon my speaking out, when you must hear bad news.
CHAR.
Troth then, prithee do you let me know what this misfortune is.
ACAN.
Since you beg of me, I'll tell you.
Your fatherCHAR.
My father did what?
ACAN.
Your mistressCHAR.
What about her ?
ACAN.
He has seen her.
CHAR.
Seen her ?
Ah wretch that I am!
What I ask you, answer me.
ACAN.
Nay, but do you ask me, if you want anything.
CHAR.
How could he see her ?
ACAN.
With his eyes..
CHAR.
In what way ?
ACAN.
Wide open.
CHAR.
Away hence and be hanged.
You are trifling, when my life's at stake.
ACAN.
How the plague am I trifling, if I answer you what you ask me ?
CHAR.
Did he see her for certain ?
ACAN.
Aye, troth, as certainly as I see you and you see me.
CHAR.
Where did he see her ?
ACAN.
Down on board the ship, as he stood near the prow and chatted with her.
CHAR.
Father, you have undone me.
Come now, you, come now, you sir ?
Why, you whip-rascal, did:
t you take care that he mightn't see her?
Why, villain, didn't you stow her away, that my father mightn't perceive her ?
ACAN.
Because we were busily employed about our busi­ ness ;
we were engaged in packing up and arranging the cargo.
While these things were being done, your father was brought alongside in a very small boat;
and not an indi­ vidual beheld the man until he was aboard the ship.
CHAR.
In vain have I escaped the sea with its dreadful tempests!
Just now I really did suppose that I was both ashore and in a place of safety ;
but I see that by the raging waves I am being hurried towards the rocks.
Say on;
what took place ?
ACAN.
After he espied the woman, he began to ask her to whom she belonged.
CHAR.
What did she answer?
ACAN.
That instant I ran up and interposed, saying that you had bought her as a maid-servant for your mother.
CHAR.
Did he seem to believe you in that ?
ACAN.
Do you e'en ask me that ?
Why the rogue began to take liberties with her.
CHAR.
Prithee, what, with her ?
ACAN.
'Twere a wonder if he had taken liberties with myself.
CHAR.
By heavens, my heart is saddened, which, drop by drop is melting away, just as though you were to put salt in water.
I'm undone.
ACAN.
Aye, aye, that one expression have you most truly uttered.
CHAR.
This is mere folly.
What shall I do ?
I do think my father won't believe me if I say that I bought her for my mother ;
and then, besides, it seems to me a shame that I should tell a lie to my parent.
He'll neither believe, nor indeed is it credible, that I bought this woman of surpassing beauty as a maid-servant for my mother.
ACAN.
Won't you be quiet, you most silly man?
Troth, he will believe it, for he just now believed me.
CHAR.
I'm dreadfully afraid that a suspicion will reach my father how the matter really stands.
Prithee, answer me this that I ask you.
ACAN.
What do you ask ?
CHAR.
Did he seem to suspect that she was my mistress ?
ACAN.
He did not seem.
On the contrary, in everything, just as I said it, he believed me.
CHAR.
As being true-as he seemed to yourself at least.
A CAN.
Not so;
but he really did believe me.
CHAR.
Ah!
wretched man that I am!
I'm ruined!
But why do I kill myself here with repining, and don't be off to the ship ?
Follow me.
(Hastening along.)ACAN.
If you go that way, you'll conveniently come slap upon your father.
As soon as he shall see you, dismayed and out of spirits, at once he'll be stopping you, and enquiring where you bought her, and for how much you bought her;
he'll be trying you in your dismay.
CHAR. (turning about).
I'll go this way in preference.
Do you think that by this my father has left the harbour ?
ACAN.
Why, it was for that reason I ran before him hither, that he mightn't come upon you unawares and fish it out of you.
CHAR.
Very properly done.
(Exeunt.DEM. (to himself).
In wondrous ways 1 do the Gods make sport of men, and in wondrous fashions do they send dreams in sleep.
As, for instance, I, this very last night that has passed, have sufficiently experienced in my sleep, and, mortal that I am, was much occupied therewith.
I seemed, to have purchased for myself a beautiful she-goat.
That she might not offend that other she-goat which I had at home be­ fore, and that they mightn't disagree if they were both in the same spot, after that I had purchased her, I seemed to entrust her to the charge 'of an ape.
This ape, not very long afterwards, came to me, uttered imprecations against me, and assailed me with reproaches;
he said that by her means and through the arrival of the she-goat he had suffered injury and loss in no slight degree;
he said that the she-goat, which I had entrusted to him to keep, had gnawed away the marriage-portion of his wife.
This seemed extremely wonderful to me, how that this single she-goat could possibly have gnawed away 2 the marriage-portion of the wife of the ape.
The ape, however, insisted that it was so, and, in short, gave me this answer, that if I didn't make haste and remove her away from his own house, he would bring her home into my house to my wife.
And, by my troth, I seemed very greatly to take an interest in her, but not to have any one to whom to entrust this she-goat;
wherefore the more, in my distress, was I tormented with anxiety what to do.
Mean­ while, a kid appeared to address me, and began to tell me that he had carried off the she-goat from the ape, and began to laugh at me.
But I began to lament and complain that she was carried off.
To what reality I am to suppose that this vision points, I can't discover;
except that I suspect that I have just now discovered this she-goat, what she is, or what it all means.
This morning, at davbreak, I went away hence down to the harbour.
After I had transacted there what I wanted, suddenly I espied the ship from Rhodes, in which my son arrived here yesterday.
I had an inclination, I know not why, to visit it;
I went on board a boat, and put off to the ship;
and there I beheld a woman of surpassing beauty, whom my son has brought as a maid-servant for his mother.
After I had thus beheld her, I fell in love with her, not as men in their senses, but after the fashion in which madmen are wont.
I' faith, in former times, in my youthful days, I fell in love, 'tis true;
but after this fashion, according as I'm now distracted, never.
Now beyond a doubt, surely thus this matter stands;
this is that she-goat.
But what that ape and that kid mean, I'm afraid.
One thing, i' faith, I really do know for certain, that I'm undone for love;
(to the AUDIENCE) con- Rider yourselves the other point, what a poor creature I am 1.
But I'll hold my tongue;
lo!
I see my neighbour;
he's coming out of doors.
(Stands aside.)LYS.
Really I will have this goat mutilated, that's giving as so much trouble at the farm.
DEM. (apart).
Neither this omen nor this augury pleases me;
I'm afraid that my wife will be just now mutilating me like the he-goat, and be acting the part of this same ape.
LYS.
Do you go hence to my country-house, and take care and deliver personally into his own hands those rakes to the bailiff Pistus himself.
Take care and tell my wife that I have business in the city, so that she mayn't expect me;
for do you mention that I have three causes coming on for judgment to-day.
Be off, and remember to say this.
SERV.
Anything more ?
LYS.
That's enough.
(Exit SERVANT.DEM. (Stepping forward).
Greetings to you, Lysimachus.
LYS.
Well met!
and greetings to you, Demipho.
How are you ?
How goes it ?
DEM.
As with one that's most wretchedl.
LYS.
May the Gods grant better things.
DEM.
As for the Gods, it's they that do this.
LYS.
What's the matter?
DEM.
I'd tell you, if I saw that you had time or leisure.
LYS.
Although I have business in hand, if you wish for anything, Demipho, I'm never too busy to give attention to a friend.
DEM.
You speak of your kindness to myself who have ex­ perienced it.
How do I seem to you as to age ?
LYS.
A subject for Acheron—an antiquated, decrepit old fellow.
DEM.
You see in a wrong light.
I am a child, Lysima­ elms, of seven years old.
LYS.
Are you in your senses, to say that you are a child ?
DEM.
I'm telling what's true.
LYS.
I' faith, it has this moment come into my mind what you mean to say;
directly a person is old, no longer has he sense or taste;
people say that he has become a child again.
DEM.
Why, no;
for I'm twice as hearty as ever I was before.
LYS.
I' faith, it's well that so it is, and I'm glad of it.
DEM.
Aye, and if you did but know;
with my eyes, too, I see even better now than I did formerly.
LYS.
That's good.
DEM.
Of a thing that's bad, I'm speaking.
LYS.
Then that same is not good.
DEM.
But, if I wished at all, could I venture to disclose something to you ?
LYS.
Boldly.
DEM. Give heed, then.
Lys.
It shall be carefully done.
DEM.
This day, Lysimachus, I've begun to go to school to learn my letters.
I know three letters already.
LYS.
How ?
Three letters ?DEM. (spelling).
A M 0 [I am in love].
LYS.
What!
you, in love, with your hoary head, you most shocking old fellow?
DEM.
Whether that is hoary, or whether red, or whether black, I'm in love.
LYS.
You're now playing upon me in this, I fancy, Demipho.
DEM.
Cut my throat, if it's false, what I'm saying.
That you may be sure I'm in love, take a knife, and do you cut off either my finger, or my ear, or my nose, or my lip:
if I move me, or feel that I'm being cut, then, Lysimachus, I give you leave to torture me to death here with being in love.
LYS. (aside to the AUDIENCE).
If ever you've seen a lover in a picture, why, there he is (pointing at DEMIPHO):
for really, in my way of thinking, an antiquated, decrepit old man is just about the same as though he were a figure painted upon a wall.
DEM.
Now, I suppose, you are thinking of censuring me.
LYS.
What, I, censure you ?
DEM.
Well, there's no reason that you should censure me.
Other distinguished men have done the like before.
It's natural to be in love, it's natural, as well, to be con­ siderate.
Then, please, don't reprove me;
no inclination impelled me to this.
LYS.
Why, I'm not reproving you.
DEM.
But still, don't you think any the worse of me for acting thus.
LYS.
I, think the worse of you ?
0, may the Deities forbid it.
DEAF.
Still, please, only do take care of that.
LYS.
Due care is taken.
DEM. Quite sure ?
Lys.
You're wearing me out.
(Aside.)
This person's de­ ranged through love.
(To DEMIPHO.)
Do you desire aught with me ?
DEM.
Farewell!LYS.
I'm making haste to the harbour;
for I've got busi­ ness there.
DEM.
Good luck go with you.
LYS.
Heartily fare you well.
DEM.
Kindly fare you well.
(Exit LYSIMACHUS.DEM. (to himself).
And what's more, I too as well have got some business at the harbour;
now, therefore, I shall be off thither.
But, look!
most opportunely I see my son.
Ill wait for the fellow;
it's necessary for me now to see him, to persuade him, as far as I possibly can, to sell her to me, and not make a present of her to his mother;
for I've heard that he has brought her as a present for her.
But I have need of precaution, that he mayn't any way imagine that I have set my fancy upon her.
CHAR, (to himself).
Never, I do think, was any person more wretched than myself, nor one who had more everlast­ ing crosses.
Isn't it the fact, that whatever thing there is that I have commenced to attempt, it cannot fall out to my wish according as I desire ?
To such an extent is some evil fortune always befalling me, which overwhelms my fair in­ tentions.
To my misfortune, I procured me a mistress to please my inclination ;
I acquired her for a sum of money, fancying that I could keep her unknown to my father.
He has found her out, and has seen her, and has undone me.
Nor have I yet determined what to say when he asks me, so much do uncertain thoughts, eye, tenfold, struggle within my breast;
nor know I now in my mind what resolution I can possibly take;
so much uncertainty, mingled with anxiety, is there in my feelings, at one moment the advice of my ser­ vant pleases me, then again it doesn't please me, and it doesn't seem possible for my father to be induced to think that she was bought as a maid-servant for my mother.
Now, if I say, as is the fact, and declare that I purchased her for myself, what will he think of me ?
He may take her away, too, and carry her hence beyond sea, to be sold!
Well taught at home, I know how severe he is.
Is this, then, being in love ?
I'd rather be at the plough-taill than love in this fashion.
Before to-day, long ago, he drove me away against my inclination from his house, my home, and bade me go and traffic.
There did I meet with this misfortune.
When its misery can surpass its pleasure, what is there delightful in it ?
In vain I've hidden her, concealed her, kept her in secret;
my father's a very fiy 1;
nothing can be kept away from him;
nothing so sacred or so profane is there, but that he's there at once;
neither have I any assured hope in my mind through which to feel confidence in my fortunes.
DEM, (apart).
What's the reason -of this, that my son is talking to himself alone ?
He seems to me anxious about some matter, I know not what.
CHAR, (looking round).
Heyday, now!
Why, surely it's my father here that I see.
I'll go and accost him.
(Ac­ costing him.)
How goes it, father ?
DEM.
Whence do you come ?
Why are you in a hurry, my son ?
CHAR.
It's all right, father.
DEM.
So I trust;
but what's the reason that your colour's so changed ?
Do you feel ill at all ?
CHAR.
I know not what it is affects my spirits, father;
this last night I didn't rest quite as well as I wished.
DEM.
As you've been travelling by sea, your eyes, I sup­ pose, are at present rather unaccustomed to the shore.
CHAR.
No doubt it is that;
but it will be going off presently.
DEM.
Troth, it's for that reason you are pale;
if you were prudent, you'd go home and lie down.
CHAR.
I haven't the leisure;
I wish to attend to business on commission.
DEM.
Attend to it to-morrow;
the day after, attend to it.
CHAR.
I've often heard from you, father, it behoves all wise men, the first thing, to give their earliest attention to business upon commission.
DEM.
Do so, then;
I have no wish to be striving against your opinion.
CHAR. (aside).
I'm all right, if, indeed, his adherence to that sentiment is immoveable and lasting.
DEM. (aside).
Why is it that he calls himself aside into counsel with himself?
I'm not afraid now lest he should be able to come to know that I'm in love with her, because I've not as yet done anything in a foolish manner, as people in love are wont to do.
CHAR. (aside).
I' faith, the affair for the present is really quite safe ;
for I'm quite certain that he doesn't know any­ thing about that mistress of mine;
if he did know, his talk would have been different.
DEM. (aside).
Why don't I accost him about her ?CHAR. (aside).
Why don't I betake myself off hence?
(Aloud.)
I'm going to deliver the commissions from my friends to their friends.
(Moves as if going.)DEM.
Nay, but stop ;
I still want to make a few enquiries of you first.
CHAR.
Say what it is you wish.
DEM.
Have you all along been well ?
CHAR.
Quite well all the time, so long, indeed, as I was there ;
but as soon as I had arrived here in harbour, 1 don't know what faintness it was came over me.
DEM.
I' faith, I suppose it arose from sea-sickness;
but it will be going off just now.
But how say you ?
What ser­ vant-maid is this that you have brought from Rhodes for vour mother ?
CHAR.
I've brought one.
DEM.
Well, what sort of a woman is she as to appearance ?
CHAR.
Not an ill-favored one, i' faith.
DEM.
How is she as to manners ?
CHAR.
In my way of thinking, I never saw one better.
DEM.
So, indeed, i' faith, she seemed to me when I saw her.
CHAR.
How now, have you seen her, father ?
DEM.
I have seen her;
but she doesn't suit our ways, and so she doesn't please me.
CHAR.
Why so ?
DEM.
Because she hasn't a figure suit­ able to our establishment;
we stand in need of no female servant but one who can weave, grind, chop wood, make yarn, sweep out the house, stand a beating, and who can hav3 every day's victuals cooked for the household.
This one will be able to do not any single one of these things.
CHAR.
Why, in fact, for this reason I purchased her, to make a present of her to my mother.
DEM.
Don't you be giving her, nor mention that you have brought her.
CHAR. (aside).
The Deities favour me.DEM. (aside).
I'm shaking him by slow degrees.
(Aloud.)
But, what I omitted to say,—she can neither with due pro­ priety follow your mother as an attendant, nor will I allow it.
CHAR.
But why ?
DEM.
Because, with those good looks, it would be scandalous if she were to be following a matron when she's walking through the streets;
all people would be staring, gazing, nodding, winking, hissing, twitching, crying out, be annoying, and singing serenades at our door;
my door, perhaps, would be filled with the charcoal marks 1 of her praises;
and, according as persons are scandalizing at the present day, they might throw it in the teeth of my wife and myself, that we are carrying on the business of a Procurer.
Now what occasion is there for this ?
CHAR.
Why, faith, you say what's just, and I agree with vou.
But what shall be done with her now ?
DEM.
Exactly;
I'll buy for your mother some stout wench of a female slave, not a bad servant, but of ungainly figure, as befits the mistress of a family-either a Syrian or an Egyp tian woman:
she shall do the grinding, spin out the yarn, and stand a lashing;
and on her account no disgrace at all will be befalling our doors.
CHAR.
What then if she is restored to the person of whom she was purchased ?
DEM.
By no means in the world.
CHAR.
He said that he would take her back, if she didn't suit.
DEM.
There's no need of that;
I don't want you to get into litigation, nor yet your honor to be called in question.
I' troth, I would much rather, if any must be endured, put up with the loss myself, than that disgrace or scandal on account of a woman should be brought upon my house.
I think that I am able to sell for you at a good profit.
CHAR.
I' faith, so long, indeed, as you don't be selling her at a less price than I bought her at, father.
DEM.
Do you only hold your tongue;
there is a certain old gentleman who commissioned me to buy one for him of just that same appearance.
CHAR.
But, father, a certain young man commissioned me to buy one for him of just that same appearance that she is of.
DEM.
I think that I am able to dispose of her for twenty minæCHAR.
But, if I had chosen, there have been already seven­ and-twenty minæ offered.
DEM.
But ICHAR.
Nay, but I, I sayDEM.
But you don't know what I was going to say;
do hold your tongue.
I can add three minæ even to that, so that there will be thirty.
(Looks as though on one side at a distance.)CHAR.
What are you turning yourself towards ?
DEM.
Towards him who's making the purchase.
CHAR. (staring about).
Why, where in the world is this person ?
DEM.
Look there, I see him 1, yonder (pointing);
he's bidding me even still to add five minæ.
CHAR. (aside).
By my troth, may the Gods send a curse upon him, whoever he is!
DEM. (looking in the distance).
There he is again, making a sign to me, even still, for me to add six minæ.
CHAR.
My man is bidding seven minæ, for her, full weight, father.
(Aside.)
I' faith, he shall never this day outdo' me.
DEM.
He's bidding in vain;
I will have her!
CHAR.
But the other one made the first offer.
DEM.
I care nothing for that.
CHAR.
He bids fifty.
DEAF.
No, a hundred's the offer.
Can't you desist from bid.
ding against the determination of my mind.
I' troth, you'll be having an immense profit, in such a way is this old gentleman for whom she's being purchased.
He's not in his senses by reason of his love;
whatever you as , you'll get.
CHAP..
I' faith, that young man, for whom I'm purchasing, is assuredly dying with distraction for love of her.
DEM.
Troth, very much more so is that old gentleman, if you did but know it.
CHAR.
I' faith, that old man never was nor ever will be more distracted with love than that young man, father, to whom I'm lending this assistance.
DEM.
Do be quiet, I tell you;
I'll see to that matter, that it's all right.
CHAR.
How say you?
DEM.
What is it ?
CHAR.
I didn't take her for a slave;
but it was he that took her for such.
DEM.
Let me alone.
CHAR.
By law you cannot put her - up for sale.
DEM.
I'll somehow see to that.
CHAR.
And then besides, she's the common property of myself and another person;
how do I know how he's disposed, whether he does wish or doesn't wish to sell her ?
DEM.
I'm sure he does wish.
CHAR.
But, i' faith, I believe that there's a certain person who doesn't wish.
DEM.
What matters that to me?
CHAR.
Because it's right that he should have the disposal of his own property.
DEM.
What is it you say?
CHAR.
She is the common property of myself and another person;
he isn't here at present.
DEM.
You are answering me before I ask.
CHAR.
You are buying, father, before I sell.
I don't know, I say, whe­ ther he chooses to part with her or not.
DEM.
But if she is purchased for that certain person who gave you the commission, will he choose it then ?
If I pur.
chase her for that person who gave me the commission, will he then not choose it ?
You avail nothing.
Never, on my faith, shall any person have her in preference to the person that I wish.
That I'm resolved upon.
CHAR.
Have you made up your mind that it is resolved upon ?
DEM.
Why, I'm going hence at once to the ship j there she shall be sold.
CHAR.
Do you wish me to go there with you ?
DEM.
I don't wish you.
CHAR.
You don't choose it, then.
DEM.
It's better for you to give your earliest attention to the business which you've been commissioned upon.
CHAR.
You are hindering me from doing so.
DEM.
Then do you make your excuse that you have used all diligence.
Don't you go to the harbour, I tell you that now.
CHAR.
That shall oe attended to.
DEM. (aside).
I'll be off to the harbour, and (I have need of caution lest he should find it out) I'll not buy her myself, but commission my friend Lysimachus;
he said just now that he was going to the harbour.
I'm delaying while I'm standing here.
(Exit.CHAR.
(wringing his hands, and crying aloud).
I'm lost- I'm undone.
They say that the Bacchanals tore Pentheus to pieces 1.
I do believe that that was the merest trifle com­ pared with the manner in which I am rent asunder in different ways.
Why do I exist ?
Why don't I die ?
What good is there for me in life ?
I'm determined, I'll go to a doctor 2, and there I'll put myself to death by poison, since that is being taken from me for the sake of which I desire to remain in existence.
(He is going off.)BUT.
Stop, prithee, stop, Charinus.CHAR. (turning).
Who is it that calls me back ?
EUT.
Eutychus, your friend and companion, your nearest neighbour as well.
CHAR.
You don't knows what a vast weight of my woes I am enduring.
BUT.
I do know.
I listened to it all at the door:
I know the whole matter.
CHAR.
What is it that you know?
EUT.
Your father wishes to sellCHAR.
You have the whole matter.
EUT.
-Your mistress CHAR.
You know by far too much.
BUT.
-Against your wish.
CHAR.
You know everything.
But how do you know that this woman is my mistress ?
EUT.
You yourself told me yesterday.
CHAR.
Isn't it the fact that I had quite forgotten that I told you yesterday ?
EUT.
It's not surprising it is so.
CHAR.
I now consult you.
Answer me;
by what death do you think that I should die in preference ?
EUT.
Won't you hold your peace ?
Take you care how you say that.
CHAR.
What then do you wish me to say ?
EUT.
Should you like me to trick your father nicely ?
CHAR.
I really should like it.
EUT.
Should you like me to walk to the harbourCHAR.
What, rather than that you should fly ?
EUT.
And release the fair one for a sum.
CHAR.
What, rather than you should pay her weight in gold ?
BUT.
Whence is it to come ?
CHAR.
I'll entreat Achilles to lend me the gold with which Hector was ransomed EUT.
Are you in your senses ?
CHAR.
I' faith, if I were in my senses, I shouldn't be seek­ ing you for my physician.
EUT.
Do you wish her to be purchased for as high a price as he asks ?
CHAR.
Throw in something by way of surplus;
even a thousand didrachms more than he shall demand.
EUT.
Now, do hold your peace.
But what say you as to this ?
Whence will the money come, for you to give, when your father asks for it ?
CHAR.
It shall be found, it shall be sought out, something shall be done.
EUT.
You are worrying me to death.
For I'm afraid of that " Something shall be done."CHAR.
Why won't you hold your tongue ?
EUT.
You give your commands to one who is dumb.
CHAR.
Is this matter sufficiently pointed out to you ?
EUT.
Can't you possibly be attending to something else PCHAR.
It isn't possible.
EUT. (going).
Kindly fare you well.
CHAR.
I' faith, I cannot fare well, before you come back to me.
EUT.
To better purpose, recover your senses.
CHAR.
Farewell, and prevail, and be my preserver.
EUT.
I'll do so.
Wait for me at home.
CHAR.
Do you take care, then, to betake yourself back just now with the booty.
(Exit EUTYCHUS, and CHARINUS goes into DEMIPHO'S house.
LYS. (to himself).
I've lent my assistance to my friend in .a friendly manner;
this piece of goods, which my neighbour requested me, I've purchased.
(Turning to PASICOMPSA.)
You are my own;
then follow me.
Don't weep.
You are acting very foolishly;
spoiling such eyes.
Why, really you have more reason to laugh than to be crying.
LYS.
Ask me what you please.
PAS.
Why have you bought me ?
LYS.
What, I, bought you ?
For you to do what you are bidden;
in like manner what you bid me, I'll do.
PAS.
I am determined, to the best of my ability and skill, to do what I shall think you desire.
LYS.
I shall bid you do nothing of laborious work.
PAS.
Why, really, for my part, my good old gentleman, I haven't learnt, i' faith, to carry burdens, or to feed cattle at the farm, or to nurse children.
LYS.
If you choose to be a good girl, it shall be well for you.
PAS.
Then, i' faith, to my sorrow, I'm undone.
LYS.
Why so ?
PAS.
Because in the place from which I have been conveyed hither, it used to be well with the worthless 1.LYS. (aside).
By my troth, her talk alone is worth more than the sum that she was purchased at.
(To PASICOMPSA.)
As though you would say that no woman is good.
PAS.
Indeed I don't say so;
nor is it my way, to say a thing which I believe all people are acquainted with.
LYS.
I want to ask this one thing of you.
PAS.
I'll answer you when you ask.
LYS.
What say you now?
What am I to say your name is ?
PAS.
Pasicompsa.
LYS.
The name was given you from your good looks2.
But what say you, Pasicompsa ?
Can you, if occasion should arise, spin a fine woof ?
PAS.
I can.
LYS.
If you know how to do a fine one, I'm sure you can spin a coarser one.
PAS.
For spinning, I fear no woman that's of the same age.
LYS.
Upon my faith, I take it that you are good and industrious, since, young woman, now that you are grown up, you know how to do your duty.
PAS.
I' faith, I learned it from a skilful mistress.
I won't let my work be called in question.
LYS.
Well, thus the matter stands, i' faith.
Look now, I'll give you a sheep for your own, one sixty years old.
PAS.
My good old gentleman, one so old as that ?
LYS.
It's of the Grecian breed.
If you take care of it, it is a very good one;
it is shorn very easily.
PAS.
For the sake of the compliment, whatever it is that shall be given me, I shall receive it with thanks.
LYS.
Now, damsel, that you mayn't be mistaken, you are not mine;
so don't think it.
LYS.
You've been bought back for your own master.
I've bought you back for him1;
he requested me to do so.
PAS.
My spirits have returned, if good faith is kept with me.
LYS.
Be of good courage;
this person will give you your liberty.
I' troth, he did so dote upon you this day as soon as ever he had seen you.
PAS.
I' faith, it's now two years since he commenced his connexion with me.
Now, as I'm sure that you are a friend of his, I'll disclose it.
LYS.
How say you?
Is it now two years since he formed the connexion with you ?
PAS.
Certainly, it is;
and we agreed, on oath, between ourselves, I with him, and he with me, that I would never have intercourse with any man except himself, nor he with any woman except myself.
LYS.
Immortal Gods!
Isn't he even to sleep with his wife ?
PAS.
Prithee, is he a married man ?
He neither is nor will he be.
LYS.
Indeed, I wish he wasn't.
I' faith, the fellow has been committing perjury.
LYS.
Why, really he's a child, vou simpleton;
for, in fact, it'is not so very long a time since his teeth fell out.
PAS.
What ?
His teeth?
LYS.
It's no matter ?
Follow me this way, please;
he requested that I would find you room for one day in my house, since my wife is away in the country.
(He goes into his home, followed by PASICOMPSA.)DEM. (to himself).
At last I've managed to ruin myself:
a mistress has been purchased for me without the knowledge of my wife and son.
I'm resolved on it;
I'll have recourse again to former habits and enjoy myself.
In my allotment of existence, almost now run through, the little that there re­ mains of life, I'll cheer up with pleasure, wine, and love.
For it's quite proper for this time of life to enjoy itself.
When you are young, then, when the blood is fresh, it's right to devote your exertions to acquiring your fortune ;
and then when at last, you are an old man, you may set yourself at your ease;
drink, and be amorous;
this, the fact that you are living, is now so much profit.
This, as I say, I'll carry out in deed.
(Turning to his house.)
Meanwhile, however, I'll take a look in-doors here at my house ;
my wife has been some time expecting me at home quite hungry:
now, she'll be worrying me to death with her scolding, if I go in-doors.
But, in fine, whatever comes of it, i' faith, I'll not go, but I'll first meet this neighbour of mine before I return home;
I want him to hire some house for me, where this damsel may dwell.
And, see, he's coming out of doors.
LYS. (to PASICOMPSA, within).
I'll bring him to you directly, if I meet him.
DEM. (behind).
He's meaning me.
LYS. (turning about).
How say you, Demipho ?DEM.
Is the damsel at your house ?
LYS.
What do you suppose ?
DEM.
What if I go see her ?
(Moves towards the house.)LYS.
Why making such haste ?
Stay.DEM.
What am I to do ?
LYS.
What you ougl it to do;
take care and consider.
DEM.
Consider what ?
Why troth, for my own part, I think there's need for my doing this, going in-doors therq I mean.
LYS.
What, is it so, you old wether ?
Would you be going in ?
DEM.
What should I do else ?
LYS.
First listen to this, and attend;
there's something even before this that I think it proper you should do.
For if you now go in-doors to her, you'll be wishing to em­ brace her, chatting with her, and kissing her.
DEM.
Really you know my feelings;
you understand what 1 would be at.
LYS.
You will be doing wrong.
DEM.
What, with that which you love ?
LYS.
So much the less reason.
Would you, full of hungri­ ness, with a foul breath, a stinking old fellow, be kissing a woman ?
And wouldn't you, as you approached, be setting a female vomiting ?
DEM.
I' faith, I'm sure that you're in love, as you point out these things beforehand to me.
What then, if I give a dinner ?
If you approve of this, let's lay hold of some cook, who may be cooking away a meal 1 here at your house, even until the evening.
LYS.
Well, I'm of that way of thinking.
Now you are talking wisely, and like a lover.
DEM.
Why are we standing here ?
Why then don't we be off and procure the provisions, that we may be comfortable ?
LYS.
For my part, I'll follow you.
And, i' troth, you'll be finding out a lodging for her, if you are prudent;
for, i' faith, she shan't be at my house a single day beyond the present;
I'm afraid of my wife, lest, if she should return from the country to-morrow, she'll be finding her here.
(Exeunt.CHAR. (to himself).
Am I not a wretched mortal, who can rest quietly nowhere ?
If I'm at home, my mind's abroad;
but if I'm abroad, my mind's at home.
To such a degree has love kindled a flame in my breast and in my heart;
did not the tears fall from my eyes, why then, I doubt, my head would be on fire.
I cling to hope;
safety I've lost;
whether she'll return or no, I know not.
If my father seizes her, as he has said, then my welfare is gone in exile;
but if my companion has done what he promised, then my welfare has not departed.
But still, even if Eutychus had had gouty feet, he could have been back from the harbour by this.
This is a very great fault of his, that he is too slow, against the wishes of my feelings.
But (looking towards the side) isn't this he whom I espy running P 'Tis he himself;
I'll go meet him.
(Clasps his hands.)
Thou who art the overlooker of Gods and of men and the mistress of mortals as well, inas­ much as thou hast indulged me in this hope that I enter­ tained, I do return thee thanks.
Does any hope remain?
Alas!
I'm utterly undone.
His countenance by no means pleases me!
He moves along in sadness.
My breast bums.
I am in doubt.
He shakes his head.
Eutychus!EUT.
Alas!
Charinus.
(He pants.)CHAR.
Before you take breath, in one word, speak out.
Where am IF Here, or among the dead ?
EUT.
You are neither among the dead nor here.
CHAR.
I'm saved, immortality has been vouchsafed me— he has purchased her.
He has nicely tricked my father.
There's no one living more clever at gaining his purpose.
Prithee, do tell me;
if I'm neither here nor at Acheron, where aID I ?BUT.
Nowhere in the world.
CHAR.
I'm utterly undone!
That speech has just put an end to me here.
Whatever it is, do come to the material points of the matter.
EUT.
First of all, we are ruined.
CHAR.
But why don't you in preference tell me that which I don't know ?
It is an annoying way of speaking, when you should despatch the business, to be beating about the bush 1.BUT.
The damsel has been taken away from you.
CHAR.
Eutychus, you are guilty of a capital offence.
EUT.
How so ?
CHAR.
Because you are killing your year's-mate and friend, a free citizen.
EUT.
May the Gods forbid it!
CHAR.
You've thrust a sword into my throat;
this moment I shall fall.
BUT.
Troth now, prithee, don't be desponding in mind.
CHAR.
I have none to be desponding in.
Tell on, then, the rest of your bad news;
for whom has she been purchased ?
BUT.
I don't know.
She had been already knocked down to the bidder and taken off by him, when I got to the harbour.
CHAR.
Ah me!
Already, indeed, have you heaped burn­ ing mountains of woe upon me.
Proceed, executioner, tor­ ment me on, since you have once begun.
EUT.
This is not more a cause of anguish to yourself, than it has proved to me this day.
CHAR.
Tell me, who bought her PEUT.
I' faith, I do not know.
CHAR.
Well, is this a good friend giving one his aid ?
EUT.
What would you have me do ?
CHAR.
The same that you see me doing, die with grief.
But did you make enquiry, what was the appearance of the person that had bought her?
Perhaps the damsel might have been traced out by that means.
EUT.
Ah!
wretch that I am-CHAR.
Do cease lament­ ing ;
attend to that which you are now about.
EUT.
What have I done ?
CHAR.
Proved the destruction of myself, and with myself of your own word.
BUT.
The Gods know that that is not any fault of mine.
CHAR.
A fine thing, indeed!
You mention the G ods, who are absent, as witnesses;
how am I to believe you in that ?
BUT.
Why, it rests with your own self what to believe;
with myself, what to say, that rests with me.
CHAR.
On that point you are ready, so as to give answer like for like;
but as to what you are requested, you are lame, blind, dumb, defective, and weak.
You promised that you would trick my father;
I myself supposed that I was entrusting the matter to a skilful person, and I entrusted it to an utter stone.
BUT.
What could I do ?
CHAR.
What could you do, do you ask me ?
You should have enquired, and asked who he was or whence he was, of what lineage;
whether he was a citizen or a foreigner——EUT.
They said that he was a citizen of Attica.
CHAR.
At least, you should have found out where he lives, if you couldn't the name.
BUT.
No person was able to say he knew.
CHAR.
But at least you should have enquired what was the appearance of the man.
EUT.
I did do so.
CHAR.
Of what figure, then, did they say he was ?
EUT.
I'll tell you:
grey-headed, bandy-legged, pot-bellied, wide-mouthed, of stunted figure, with darkish eyes, lank jaws, splay-footed rather.
CHAR.
You are mentioning to me not a human being, but a whole storehouse, I don't know what, of deformities.
Is there anything else that you can tell about him PEUT.
It is just as much as I know.
CHAR.
I' troth, for sure, with his lank jaws he has caused my jaw to drop 1. I cannot endure it;
I'm determined that I'll go hence in exile.
But what state in especial to repair to, I'm in doubt;
Megara, Eretria, Corinth, Chalcis, Crete, Cyprus, Sicyon, Cnidos, Zacynthus, Lesbos, or Bœotia.
EUT.
Why are you adopting that design ?
CHAR.
Why, because love is tormenting me.
BUT.
What say you as to this ?
Suppose, if when you have arrived there, whither you are now intending to go, you begin there to fall desperately in love, and there, too, you fail of success, then you'll be taking flight from there as well, and after that, again, from another place, if the same shall happen, what bounds, pray, will be set to your exile, what limits to your flight P
What country or home can possibly be certain for you ?
Tell me that.
Say now, if you leave this city, do you fancy that you'll leave your love here behind ?
If it is so fully taken as certain in your mind that so it will be, if you hold that as a point resolved upon, how much better is it for you to go away somewhere in the country, to be there, to live there, until the time when desire for her and passion have set you at liberty ?
CHAR.
Have you now said your say ?
EUT.
I have said it.
CHAR.
You have said it to no pur­ pose ;
this is my full determination.
I'll be off home, to pay my duty to my father and my mother ;
after that, unknown to my father, I'll fly from this country, or adopt some other plan.
(Goes into DEMIPHO'S house.)EUT. (to himself).
How suddenly he has taken himself off and gone away.
Ah !
wretch that I am!
if he goes away, all will say that it has happened through my remissness.
I'm determined at once to order as many criers as possible to be hired to search for her to find her;
after that, I'll go to the Prætor forthwith, and beg him to give me search-warrant officers in all the quarters of the city;
for I find that nothing else whatever is now left for me to do.
(Exit.DOR. (to herself).
Since a messenger came to me in the country from my husband, that he couldn't come into the country, I made up my mind, and came back to follow after him who fled from me.
But (looking round) I don't see our old woman Syra following.
Aye, look, there she comes at last.
DOR.
Why don't you go quicker ?
SYR.
By my troth, I cannot;
so great is this burden that I'm carrying.
DOR.
What burden ?
SYR.
Fourscore years and four, and to that are added servitude, sweat, and thirst;
these things as well which I am carrying weigh me down.
DOR.
Give me something, Syra, with which to decorate this altar of our neighbourl.
SYR. (holding out a sprig).
Present this sprig of laurel, then.
DOR.
Now do you go into the house.
SYR.
I'm going.
(Goes into the house of LYSIMACHUS.)DOR.
(laying the sprig on the altar).
Apollo, I pray thee that thou wilt propitiously grant peace, safety, and health, unto our household, and that in thy propitiousness thou wilt show favour to my son.
SYR.
I'm utterly undone!
Wretch that I am, I'm ruined!
Ah!
wretched me DOR.
Prithee, are you quite in your senses ?
What are you howling for ?
SYR.
Dorippa, my dear Dorippa!
DOR.
Prithee, why are you crying out ?
SYR.
Some woman, I know not who, is here in-doors in the house.
DOR.
Is it so, really ?
SYR.
In serious truth.
You know how to act very prudently, in not remaining in the country.
A fool even could have found it out that she was the mistress of your very pretty husband.
DOR.
By heavens, I believe it.
SYR. (taking her arm).
Step this way with me, that you, my Juno, may see as well your rival Alcmena.
DOR.
I' troth, I certainly shall go there, as fast as I can.
(They go into the house of LYSlMACHUS.)Lys. (to himself).
Is this too little of a misfortune that Demipho's in love, that he must be extravagant as well ?
If he had been inviting ten men of highest rank to dinner, he has provided too much.
But the cooks he directed in such a way just as at sea the time-keeper1 is wont to direct the rowers.
I hired a Cook myself, but I'm surprised that he hasn't come as I directed him.
But who's this, I wonder, that's coming out of my house ?
The door's opening.
(He stands aside.)DOR. (weeping).
No woman ever will be, or ever has been, more wretched than myself in being married to such a hus­ band.
Alas!
unhappy that I am!
Just see, to what a husband have you committed yourself and the property you have!
Just see, to what a person I brought ten talents for a portion;
that I should see these things, that I should endure these insults.
LYS. (behind).
I' troth, I'm undone;
my wife's returned from the country already.
I do believe she has seen the damsel in the house.
But what she says I cannot distinctly ear from hence ;
I'll go nearer to her.
(Approaches her.)DOR.
Ah! woe to wretched meLys. (behind).
Aye, and to me as well.
DOR.
I'm utterly undone!
LYS. (behind).
As for me, i' faith, to my sorrow I'm down­ right undone!
she has seen her.
May all the Gods con. found you, Demipho!DOR.
I' troth, this was it, why my husband wouldn't go into the country.
LYS. (behind).
What shall I do now, but go up and speak to her ?
(Goes up to her.)
The husband bids health to his wife.
Are the country peoplel becoming townsfolk ?
DOR.
They are acting more decently than those who are not become country people.
LYS.
Are the people in the country at all in fault ?
DOR.
I' faith, less so than the townsfolk, and much less mischief do they meet with for themselves.
LYS.
But in what have the townsfolk done wrong ?
Tell me that.
DOR.
Whose woman is that in the house ?
LYS.
What, have you seen her ?
DOR.
I have seen her.
LYS.
Whose is she, do you ask?
DOR.
I shall find out, in spite of you;
i' faith, I long to know.
But you are trying me on purpose.
LYS.
Do you wish me to tell you whose she is ?
She, she (Aside.)
Ah me!
upon my faith, I don't know what to say.
LYS. (aside).
I never saw one who did it more.
DOR.
But why don't you tell me ?
LYS.
Nay, but if I mayDOR.
You ought to tell me.
LYS.
I cannot, you hurry me so;
you press me as though were guilty.
DOR. (ironically).
I know you are free from all guilt.
LYS.
Speak out as boldly as you please.
DOR.
Tell me, then.
LYS.
I, tell you ?
DOR.
Why, it must be told, in spite of everything.
LYS.
She isDo you wish me tell her name as well ?
DOR.
You are trifling.
I've caught you in the fact;
you are guilty.
LYS.
Guilty of what P If now I had no occasion for silence, now I shouldn't tell you 1.
Why, this same woman isDOR, Who is she ?
LYS.
She——DOR.
Marry, come up !
don't you know who she is ?
LYS.
Why, yes, I do know.
I've been chosen as an arbi­ trator with respect to her.
DOR.
An arbitrator ?
Now I know ;
you have invited her here to consult with you.
LYS.
Why no;
she has been given me as a deposit.
DOR. (ironically).
I understand.
LYS.
By my troth, it's not anything of that sort.
DOR.
You are clearing yourself too soon9.
LYS. (aside).
Too much of a business have I met with ;
really I'in stuck fast.
COOK.
Make haste, get quickly on, for I've got to cook a dinner for an old gentleman in love.
And, in fact, when I think of it again, it's to be cooked for ourselves, not him for whom we've been hired:
for a person that's in love, if he has that with which he is in love, he esteems that as food, to see her, embrace her, kiss her, chat with her;
but we, I trust, shall return well laden home.
Step this way.
But see, here's the old gentleman that hired us.
LYS. (aside).
Why, look!
I'm undone!
here's the Cook.
COOK (going up to LYSIMACHUS).
We are come.
LYS.
Be off!
COOK.
How, be off?
LYS. (in a low voice).
Hush!
Be off!
COOK.
What, I, be off?
LYS.
Be off, I say.
COOK.
Are you not going to have a dinner ?
LYS.
We are full already.
DOR.
ButLYS. (aside).
I'm utterly undone.
DOR.
What say you ?
Have those persons ordered these things to be brought to you as well, between whom you were appointed arbitrator PCOOK.
Is this person (pointing to DORIPPA) your mis­ tress, whom a little time since you told me you were in love with, when you were baying the provisions ?
LYS.
Won't you hold your tongue ?
COOK.
A'very pretty figure of a woman !
I' faith, she does love a sweetheart.
LYS.
Won't you be off to perdition ?
COOK.
She's not amiss.
LYS.
But you are amiss.
COOK.
I' troth, I do fancy she's a nice bed-fellow.
LYS.
Won't you be off?
I'm not the person that hired you just now.
COOK.
How's that?
Nay but, upon my faith, you are that very man.
LYS. (aside).
Alas!
wretch that I am!
COOK.
Your wife's in the country, I suppose, whom you were saying a little time ago you hated full as much as vipers.
LYS.
I, said that to you ?
COOK.
Aye, to me, upon my faith.
LYS.
So may Jupiter love me, wife, I never did say that.
DOR.
Do you deny that as well ?COOK (to DORIPPA).
He didn't say he hated you, but his wife.
DOR.
This is made clear, that you detest me.
LYS.
But I deny it.
COOK.
And he said that his wife was in the country.
LYS. (pointing to DORIPPA).
This is she.
Why are you annoying me ?
COOK.
Because you say that you don't know me.
Are you afraid of her ?
LYS.
I'm wise in being so;
for she's my only companion.
COOK.
Do you wish to use my services ?
LYS.
I don't wish.
COOK.
Give me my pay.
LYS.
Ask for it to-morrow ;
it shall be given you;
for the present, be off.
(Aside.)
Alas, wretch that I am!
I now find that that old saying is a true one, that some bad comes through a bad neighbour.
COOK (to the SCULLIONS).
Why are we standing here ?
LYS.
Why don't you be gone ?
COOK (aside to LYSIMACHUS).
If any inconvenience hap­ pens to you, that's not my fault.
LYS. (aside to the COOK).
Why, you are utterly ruining wretched meCOOK (aside to LYSIMACHUS).
I understand now what you want.
You mean, you wish me to go away from here.
LTS. (aside to the COOK).
I do wish it, I say.
COOK aside to LYSIMACHUS).
I'll be off.
Pay me a drachma.
LYS. (aside to the COOK).
It shall be paid.
COOK (aside to LYSIMACHUS).
Then order it to be paid me, please.
It can be paid in the meantime, while they are putting down the provisions.
LYS. (aside to the COOK).
Why don't you be off?
Can't you cease being troublesome ?
(Slips the money into his hand.)COOK (to the SCULLIONS).
Come, do you set down those provisions before the feet of that old gentleman.
These baskets I'll order to be fetched from your house either by- and-by or else to-morrow.
(To the SCULLIONS.)
Do you follow me.
(Exeunt, having set down the provisions.)LYS.
Perhaps you are surprised at that Cook, that he came and brought these things.
I'll tell you why it is.
DOR.
I'm not surprised if you do anything wrongful or criminal;
and, by heavens, I'll not put up with it, that I am married thus unfortunately, and that harlots are brought into my house in this way.
Syra, go ask my father, in my name, to come here directly together with you.
SYR.
I'll go.
LYS.
Prithee, wife, you don't know what the matter is.
In set form now will I make oath, that I have never had any­ thing to do with her.
(-Exit SYRA.)
What, is Syra gone now ?
By heaven, I'm undone ! (DORIPPA goes into the house.)LYS. (to himself).
But, see, she's off as well!
Woe to wretched me !
Then, neighbour Demipho, may the Gods and Goddesses confound you, together with your mistress and your intriguings!
He has most unjustly loaded me with suspicions;
he has stirred up enemies against me.
At 'home my wife is most infuriated.
I'll be off to the Forum, and tell this to Demipho, that I'll drag this woman by the hair into the street, unless he takes her hence out of this house wherever he chooses.
(Goes to the door and calls.)
Hark you!
wife, wife!
although you're angry at me, you'll order, if you are wise, these things to be carried hence in- doors.
We shall be able by-and-by to dine all the better upon the same.
SYR. (to herself).
Whither my mistress sent me, to her father ,he's not at home;
they said that he has gone off into the country.
Now, I'll take home this answer.
I' faith, the women do live upon hard terms, and, wretched creatures, on much more unjust ones than the men.
For if a husband has been keeping a mistress without the knowledge of his wife, if the wife comes to know it, the husband gets off with impunity;
if, unknown to the husband, the wife goes from the house out of doors, a pretext arises for the husband, the marriage is dissolved 1.
I wish the law was the same for the husband as for the wife;
for the wife that is a good one, is content with one husband;
why, any the less, should the husband be content with one wife ?
By my troth, I'd give cause, if men were punished in the same way (if any one should be keeping a mistress unknown to his wife), as those women are repudiated who are guilty of a slip, that there should be more divorced men than there are women now.
EUT. (to himself, apart).
I'm quite tired with hunting the whole city through;
I find nothing whatever about this woman.
But ray mother has returned from the country;
for I see Syra standing before the house.
Syra!SYR.
Who is it that's calling me ?
EUT.
'Tis I, your master and foster-child.
SYR. (turning round).
Save you, my foster-child.
BUT.
Has my mother returned from the country then ?
Answer me.
SYR.
Aye, for her own especial sake and that of the family.
EUT.
What is it that's the matter ?
SYR.
That very pretty father of yours has brought a mis­ tress into the house.
BUT.
HOW say you ?
SYR.
Your mother, on arriving from the country, found her at home.
EUT.
By my troth, I didn't think my father was a person for those practices.
Is the woman now even still in-doors ?
SYR.
Even still.
EUT.
Do you follow me.
(He goes into the house of LYS- MACHUS.)[SYR. (to herself).
How now 1 ?
Do I see Peri strata here, the wife of Demipho ?
She quickens her pace;
she glances about with her eyes;
she turns herself round;
she inclines her neck on one side.
I'll observe from here what matter she's about;
it's something of importance, whatever scent she's upon.
(Stands aside.)PER.
The Goddess Astarte2 is the might of mortals and of the Gods, their life, their health;
she, the same, who is like­ wise their death, destruction, downfall, the seas, the earth, the heaven, and the stars.
Whatever Temples of Jove we inhabit, they are guided by her nod;
her do they obey;
to her do they pay regard;
what displeases her, the other Deities do quickly put aside.
Whatever pleases her, that, all things, which live and have sense, do pursue.
Some she tortures, destroys;
others, with her own milk does she nourish and raise aloft;
but those whom she tortures, they live and enjoy their senses;
those whom she hastens to rear and raise aloft, these last indeed do perish forthwith, and to their sorrow use their senses.
Then, well-wishers, they lie prostrate, objects of dislike they bite the ground, grovel upon their faces, roar out, and make a riot;
and when they think they live, then in especial do they rush on to ruin, then, then do they show eagerness in the pursuit of the object beloved;
young men stumble, aged men likewise are led away.
They love themselves;
the object which they love, they wish to be loved and known.
But if at that age they begin to fall in love, much more grievous is their madness.
But if they do not love, then they hate, they are morose, too, and way­ ward;
tattlers, haters, ill-disposed, passionate, envious for themselves and theirs.
What they have formerly been shame­ lessly guilty of themselves, if it is done in a more quiet way, fathers do not tolerate as they ought to do;
but they proclaim it, and indecently cry it out aloud.
SYR. (apart).
So far as I understand, Demipho is treating this lady badly too.
PER.
This is the truth.
My son is in love and is dying ;
when his father came to know of it, he was enraged beyond bounds.
What insanity is this ?
This same husband of mine at one time packed my son off to Rhodes to traffic ;
now, ac­ cording to the news Acanthio brings, he'll be betaking him­ self into banishment.
0 unjust father!
0 unfortunate son!
whither will you betake yourself?
Where will you leave your mother ?
Shall I pass my life bereft ?
Shall I lose my son ?
I will not endure it.
Has his father sold her ?
Wherever she shall be found, the mother will redeem her.
Do you tell me, Lycissa, do they suppose that she was brought into this neighbourhood ?
LYC.
(pointing to the house of LYSIMACHUS).
To that, I fancy;
to the house of a certain old gentleman, a friend.
PER.
Here, there is no one that 1 know of besides Lysi­ machus.
SYR. (apart).
They are mentioning Lysimachus.
It's a wonder if the old fellows, who are neighbours, haven't been going halves in the same nest.
PER.
I'll go look for Dorippa, his wife.
(The door of the house of LYSIMACHUS opens.)LYC.
Why go look for her ?
Don't you see her ?
PER.
Indeed, I do see her.
Let's listen;
she's muttering something in a passion, I know not what, to herself.
(They stand aside.)DOR. (to herself).
Syra hasn't come back, whom, poor wretch, it's now a long time since I sent to fetch my father;
in her very slowness, she has either hardened into a stone, or she has stopped from swelling with the sting of a serpent.
SYR. (apart), I'm undone;
here's my mistress, -lie s look.
ing after me.
Don. (continuing).
I cannot remain at home;
my eyes cannot abide that pretty young harlot;
I would have shut her out of doors, but my son Eutychus prevented me.
Still, I shan't altogether belie ve the news he brings.
LYC. (apart).
Do you hear, mistress ?PER. (apart).
I hear;
let her go on.
LYC. (apart).
I'll let her.
DOR, (to herself).
He says that she has come hither to our house for the sake of an old gen.
tleman, a friend;
that he has her for sale, so that he may with draw her from his son, who's in love with her.
This really is a falsehood, either in my husband or my son;
the accounts differ.
The husband says that she was given him as a deposit;
but the son says that she's on sale.
SYR. (apart).
I'll go meet her on a sudden, that she mayn't find out that I've been loitering.
DOR.
In this matter I shan't believe my son, who's acting in compliance with his father;
for, for him, like a regular cuckoo 1, has he determined to tell abundance of lies :
for my own part I shall believe the Cook, in preference.
But see, here's Svra.
How the old witch does run.
Svra!SYR.
Who's calling me ?
(Stares around he;
.)DOR.
The Gods send a plague upon you!
SYR.
Mistress, if you are wise, bestow this upon your rival and your husband in preference.
DOR.
For saying that, I'm no longer angry with you.
But where's your father ?
Why does he delay ?
Does gout hinder the man ?
SYR.
He's lame with neither gout nor chalk-stones 2, whom his feet carry into the country.
DOR.
Not at home ?
SYR.
No.SYB.
They say he's in the country, and that it's uncertain whether he'll return to-day, he has such a large account with his bailiff.
DOR.
Everything is befalling me this day contrary to my wishes.
I shan't live till the evening, unless I drive that hussy away from the house.
(She turns to the door.)
I'm going home.
LYC. (apart).
The mistress is going away.
PER. (apart).
What, going away?
Call her.
LYC. (calling).
Dorippa!
Dorippa!DOR. (turning round).
What nuisance is this?
Who's calling me back ?
PER.
I'm not a nuisance, but a well-wisher;
and it's your friend Peristrata addresses you.
Prithee, do stay.
DOR.
Why, Peristrata—i’ faith, I didn't know you:
dread­ ful vexation is tormenting and agitating me.
PER.
This I enquire about—prithee don't deny me.
I heard you just now;
tell me what annoyance is troubling you.
DOR.
Peri strata, so may the Gods prosper your only son, do kindly lend me your attention;
none could be given me more agreably:
our ages are alike;
together we grew up;
we have husbands alike in age;
with no one do I converse with greater pleasure.
I'm really annoyed with good reason.
What now would your feelings be, if at this time of life your husband Demipho were to bring a mistress before your eyes ?
PER.
Has he brought one ?
DOR.
So it is.
PER.
She's at your house ?
DOR.
At my house;
aye, and cooks were hired;
a ban­ quet was being prepared, if my coming hadn't upset every­ thing.
Venus and Cupid are tormenting the wretched old fellow at an unseasonable time.
PER.
But these things are trifles, Dorippa.
I wish that I wasn't more wretched.
DOR.
Trifles ?
PER.
Really trifles.
DOR.
What worse could your husband do ?
PER.
A ye, worse than worse.
DOR.
What is it ?
Prithee do say.
As you to me, so I to you, let's give advice to each other what needs to be done.
It's an old saying, that, "he's truly wise who is wise at the risk of another."PER.
Dorippa, I have an only son;
do you know that ?
DOR.
I do know it.
PER.
Him his father some time ago packed off from his own house to Rhodes.
DOR.
For what reason ?
PER.
Because he was in love.
DOR.
For that very thing?
PER.
Yes, and the very same thing now as well-inasmuch as he had brought a female slave here, his father coming to know of it, took her away, and put her up for sale.
DOR.
Aye, aye, I know it;
my son told me the truth.
I fancied she was the mistress of my husband.
To whom was she entrusted ?
PER.
To a certain old gentleman in this neighbourhood, his friend.
I think that he has no other friend here except your husband.
DOR. (aside).
It certainly is she.

What does your son ?
PER.
He declares that he'll leave this city.
DOR.
The matter's in a safe position.
What if he finds her ?
PER.
I imagine he'll stay.
DOR.
Beyond expectation we are saved;
don't doubt it;
she's at my house.
PER.
At your house ?
It was she, I suppose, about whom J beard you talking just now.
DOR.
It was she.
PER.
0 well done;
I love you with reason;
you've re­ stored me my son.
Do let me see her.
DOR.
Let's go in-doors then.
PER. Let's go. (Turning round.)
Come here, Lycissa.
Do you go tell these things to Acanthio.
I'll go here to Dorippa's house.
(Exit LYCISSA.
DORIPPA, PERISTRATA, and SYRA go into the house of LYSIMACHUS.)]
CHAR.
(looking towards the door).
0 higher and lower1 portions of the threshold, now both of you farewell.
This day for the last time do I raise this foot within my father's house.
The ease, the enjoyment, the in-dwelling, the habita­ tion of this house is henceforth for me cut off, destroyed, and alienated.
I am undone !
The household Gods of my parents, the Lar the father of the family2, to you do I recommend, that you will kindly protect the possessions of my parents.
I shall now seek other household Gods for myself, another Lar, another city, another state.
The people of Attica I do do­ test ;
for where worse manners are on the increase every day, where, those who are friends, those who are faithless, you are not able to distinguish, and where that is torn away from you, which especially pleases your taste, there, in fact, if a kingdom were given one, that country is not desirable.
(Stands aside in deep thought.)EUT. (to himself).
Thou who art the overlooker of Gods and of men, and the mistress of mortals as well, inasmuch as thou hast indulged me in this hope that I entertained, I do return thee thanks.
What Deity is there now that is joyous with gladness like mine ?
That was at home which I was in search of.
There did I find six companions, life, friendship, my native land, festivity, mirth, and jollity.
On finding these, at the same moment did I utterly destroy ten very bad things, wrath, hatred, folly, ruin, perverseness, grief, tears, exile, want, and loneliness.
Ye Gods, I pray you grant me a speedy opportunity of meeting him.
CHAR.
( to himself, not seeing EUTYCHUS).
I'm ready pre­ pared, as you see.
Pride I cast aside;
I'm my own companion, attendant, horse, groom, esquire;
I'm my own master, I, too, obey myself;
for my own self do I carry what I require.
0 Cupid!
how powerful art thou.
For easily dost thou render any one resolute through thy deeds, and then again, the same person diffident forthwith from being over bold.
EUT. (to himself).
I'm thinking which way to run in search of him.
CHAR. (continuing).
The matter's resolved upon, that I'll seek her everywhere, wherever in the world she has been carried off from hence;
and neither shall any river stand in my way, nor mountain, nor the sea, indeed, nor heat, nor cold;
I dread neither wind nor hail;
the torrents of rain I'll submit to;
labour, heat, and thirst, will I endure.
I'll neither stop nor rest anywhere at night, or in the day, assuredly, before I shall have met with either my mistress or my death.
EUT. (looking round).
Some voice, I know not who's, flew to my ear.
CHAR. (continuing).
You do I invoke, ye Lares of the roads1, that you will kindly lend me aid.
EUT. (seeing CHARINUS).
Jupiter! isn't that Charinus?CHAR. (turning round).
Fellow-citizens, fare ye well.
EUT. (aloud).
Charinus, stop, this instant.
CHAR.
Who calls me back ?
EUT.
Hope, Safety, Victory.
CHAR.
What do you want with me ?
EUT.
To go along with you.
CHAR.
Look for another companion;
these companions that have possession of me, will not part with me.
EUT.
Who are they ?
CHAR.
Care, misery, sickness, tears, and lamentation.
BUT.
Drive away those companions, and look this way and return.
CHAR:
If indeed you wish to speak to me, do you follow.
(Moves on.)EUT.
Stop, this instant!
CHAR.
You do amiss, in de­ laying me as I haste;
the sun is setting.
BUT.
If you would make haste in this direction, just as you are hastening in that one, you'd be doing more rightly;
this way there is now a prospering gale, only tack about.
Here is a fair Westerly breeze;
there is a showery Southern blast.
The one causes a calm;
the other stirs up all the waves.
Betake yourself towards the land, Charinus, in this direction.
Don't you see right opposite ?
Black clouds and showers are coming on.
Look now to the left, how full the heaven is of brightness.
Don't you see right opposite ?
CHAR.
He has thrown religious scruples2 in my way;
I'll betake myself in that direction.
(Turns towards EUTY­ CHUS.)BUT.
You are wise.
0 Charinus, turn your steps, and turn your feet as well, in the opposite direction.
Extend your arm.
Catch hold of me.
Do you hold me new ?
CHAR.
I'm holding you.
EUT.
Hold on, then.
Whither now were you going ?
CHAR.
Into banishment.
EUT.
What to do there ?
CHAR.
As a wretched person would.
BUT.
Don't fear;
this instant shall I restore you to joyousness before you go away.
CHAR.
I'm going.
(Moves.)EUT.
A thing that you especially long to hear, the same shall you hear for you to rejoice at.
Stay this instant;
I'm come as a friend, full of the kindest feelings.
CHAR.
What is it ?
EUT.
Your mistress —CHAR.
What of her P EUT.
I know where she is.
CHAR.
Prithee, do you P EUT.
She's safe and sound.
CHAR.
Where is she safe P EUT.
I know where.
CHAR.
I'd much rather I did.
EUT.
Can't you possibly be calm in your feelings ?
CHAR.
What if my feelings are agitated PEUT.
I'll bring them for you into a safe and tranquil state;
don't you fear.
CHAR.
Prithee * * * do say where she is —where you've seen her.
Why are you mute ?
Speak­ you are torturing to death wretched me by your silence.
EUT.
She isn't far from here.
CHAR.
Why then don't you point her out, if you see her ?
EUT.
I' faith, I don't see her at this moment;
but I saw her just now.
CHAR.
Why, then, don't you cause me to see her ?
EUT.
I will cause it.
CHAR.
That means a long time for one in love.
EUT.
Are you still in apprehension P I'll disclose it all.
No person is there living more beloved by me than is he who has got her;
nor is there one to whom it is right that I should be a better wisher.
CHAR.
I don't care about that;
I'm looking for her.
EUT.
About her, then, I'm telling you.
Really, this has not come into my mind but this moment, to tell it you —CHAR.
Tell me, then, where she is.
EUT.
In our house.
CHAR.
If you are telling the truth, a worthy house, and aptly built, I deem it.
But how am I to credit that ?
Have you seen her;
or do you speak from hearsay ?
EUT.
I've seen her myself.
CHAR.
Who took her to your house ?
EUT.
Why, you're asking an unfair question.
What matters it to you with whom she came ?
CHAR.
So long as she's there—EUT.
She certainly is.
CHAR.
Then, for these tidings, do you wish whatever you please.
BUT.
What if I do wish ?
CHAR.
Pray to the Gods to bring its fulfilment.
EUT.
You are laughing at me.
CHAR.
My fortunes, in fine, are redeemed, if I can see her.
But why don't I lay aside this garb?
(Goes to the door of DEMIPHO’S house, and calls.)
Hallo, somebody, come here this instant out of doors.
Come out, and bring me thence a cloak this way.
'EUT.
Well, now how much you do gratify me.
CHAR. (to a BOY who enters, bringing his cloak).
Tomboy, who have come with such speed, take my scarf (giving it), and now stand aside there;
that, if these things are not true, I may hasten to go upon this intended journey.
(To EUTY­ CHUS.)
Are you telling the truth PEUT.
Really, Charinus, you are not ashamed of anything.
Don't you believe me ?
CHAR.
For my part, I really do believe everything that you tell me.
But why don't you introduce me to her, that I may see her ?
EUT.
Wait a little.
CHAR.
Why am I to wait ?
EUT.
It's not a convenient moment to go into the house.
CHAR.
You are torturing me to death.
EUT.
There's no need, I tell you, for you to go into the house just now.
CHAR.
Answer me—for what reason ?
BUT.
She's not at leisure.
CHAR.
Why so ?
EUT.
Because it isn't convenient to her,CHAR.
Is it so ?
Not convenient to her who loves me, and whom I love in return?
He's trifling with me in every way.
I'm too foolish to believe him.
He's only delaying me.
(Turns to the Boy.)
I'll put on my scarf again.
EUT.
Stop a little, and listen to this.
CHAR. (taking off the cloak).
You boy, take this cloak1, please.
(Puts on the travelling scarf.)EUT.
Really this hasn't come but this moment into my mind to tell it you.
My mother's dreadfully angry with my father, because he has brought into the house a harlot before her very eyes, while she was away in the country.
She sus­ pects that she's his own mistress.
CHAR. (not attending to him).
I've taken up my beltl.
(Puts it on.)BUT.
She's now enquiring into this matter in-doors.
CHAR. (inattentive).
Now my sword's in hand.
(Taking it from the BOY.)EUT.
But if I were now to introduce you ?CHAR. (inattentive).
I'll take my bottle, and be off from here.
(Moves.)CHAR.
You are mistaken;
you can't deceive me.
EUT.
And, i' faith, I have no wish.
CHAR.
Why, then, don't you allow me to proceed upon my journey ?
EUT.
I won't let you.
CHAR.
I'm delaying myself.
Boy, do you this instant be off hence in-doors.
(The BOY goes into the house.)
Now I've ascended the chariot;
now I've taken the reins in my hands.
(Imitating the action of a charioteer.)EUT.
You are not in your senses.
CHAR.
Feet of mine, why don't ye betake yourselves into the chariot, straight for Cyprus, since my father determines on my banishment ?
BUT.
You are silly.
Prithee, don't be saying this.
CHAR. (as though to himself).
l'in resolved to persist—to use my endeavours to seek her out where she is.
EUT.
Why, she's at our house.
CHAB. (as though to himself).
For what that person said, he told a falsehood in it.
BUT.
Really, I told you the truth.
CHAR. (continuing).
Now I've come to Cyprus.
EUT.
Nay, but follow me, that you may see her whom you are looking for.
(Moves towards his FATHER’S house.)CHAR.
(pretending not to hear).
Enquiring there, I didn't find her.
EUT.
I'll not care then for my mother'a anger.
CHAR. (still pretending).
I'll still go on to seek her.
Now I've got to Chalcis;
I see there my former host at Zacynthus;
I tell him why I've come thither;
I make enquiry if he has heard say who has brought her thither, who has got possession of her.
EUT.
Why don't you cease that nonsense, and step with me this way in-doors ?
CHAR. (still pretending).
My host answered that figs grew, not bad ones, at Zacynthus.
EUT.
He didn't say false there.
CHAR. (continuing).
But he says that he has heard about my mistress, that she's here at Athens.
EUT.
Really, this Zacynthian is quite a Calchas1.
CHAR. (continuing).
I get aboard ship, and start at once.
I'm now at home;
now I've returned from banishment.
My friend, Eutychus (turning towards him), greetings to you!
How have you been ?
How are my parents ?
Are they well ?
Do you come to my mother, you say—you invite me kindly;
you speak politely.
At your house to-morrow;
for the pre­ sent at home.
So it is proper;
so it ought to be done.
EUT.
How now ?
What are you dreaming about ?
This man's not in his senses.
CHAR.
Why don't you, as a friend, make haste to cure me then ?
EUT.
Follow me, please.
CHAR. (running close behind him).
I'm following.
EUT. (turning round).
Softly, pray:
you are treading on my heels.
Don't you hear me ?
CHAR.
I've heard you for some time past.
EUT.
I want a reconciliation to be made between my father and mother;
for now she's in a passion—CHAR.
(pushing him).
Only do go on.
EUT.
About that woman—CHAR.
(pushing him).
Only do go on.
BUT.
Therefore take care— CHAR.
( pushing him).
Nay, but do go on then;
I'll make her as mild as Juno is when she’s kind to Jupiter.
(They go into the house of LYSIMACHUS.)[LYS.
Demiphol, this saying of the wise, I think you have often heard, " Pleasure is the bait for misfortune;
" because, by it, not less are men :
-aught than are fishes with the hook.
Although aged people fly trom it, still you don't pay that regard to your old age:
since it hasn't even withdrawn love from you, but has forced you to it even more vehemently.
Wherefore it utterly confounds yourself and your understand ing and your mind, and dazzles your eyesight.
Myself too have you brought into great trouble, and I know not what to do.
DEM.
Lysimachus, this is the will of the Gods, not of men.
If you reflect upon this with yourself, you will be of opinion that you are not doing right, in censuring so heavily a person your friend and the sharer of your secrets.]
As though you yourself had never done anything like this action.
LYS.
By heavens, never, I took care not to do anything:
wretch that I am, I am scarcely alive;
for my wife is lying all in a ferment about her,DEM.
But I'll undertake to clear you, so that she mayn't be angry.
LYS.
Follow me—but I see my son coming out.
EUT. (as he comes out, to CHARINUS, within).
I'll go to mv father, that he may know my mother's wrath is appeased.
I'll return just now.
LYS. (to DEMIPHO).
The beginning pleases me.
(Going up to EUTYCHUS.)
What are you about ?
How goes it, Eutychus PEUT.
Extremely opportunely have you both met me.
Lys.
What's the matter ?
EUT.
Your wife is peaceful and appeased.
Give me your right hands this moment.
(Shakes hands with them both.)LYS.
The Gods are favouring me.
EUT. (to DEMIPHO).
I bring you word that you have got no mistress.
DEM.
The Gods confound you.
Why, prithee, what affair is this ?
BUT.
I'll tell you.
Give your attention then, both of you.
LYS.
Well then, we are giving you our attention, both of us.
EUT.
Those who are born of a good family, if they are of bad tendencies, by their own faultiness withdraw nobleness from their rank, and disgrace their disposition.
DEM.
He says what's true.
LYS.
Then it's to yourself he says it.
EUT.
For this reason is this the more true;
for at this time of life, it wasn't just for you to take away from your son, a young man, his mistress, purchased with his own money.
DEM.
How say you ?
Is she the mistress of Charinus ?EUT. (aside).
How the rogue does dissemble.
DEM.
Why, he said that he had bought her as a maid- servant for his mother.
EUT.
Was it for that reason, then, vou bought her, you young lover, you old boy ?
LYS.
Very well said, i' troth!
Proceed, proceed.
I'll stand by him here on the other side.
Let's both load him well with such speeches as he's worthy of.
DEM. (aside).
I'm done for.
EUT.
Who has done an in­ justice so great to his blameless son;
whom, in fact, upon my faith, I brought back home just when he was setting out in self-banishment;
for he was going into exile.
DEM.
Has he gone then?
LYS.
What, do you speak, you hobgoblin ?
At this time of life you ought to abstain from those pursuits.
DEM.
I confess it;
undoubtedly I've acted wrong.
EUT.
What, do you speak, you hobgoblin ?
You ought at this time of life to have done with these guilty practices.
Just as the seasons of the year, so different lines of conduct befit different ages;
but if this is proper, that old fellows should be wenching in their old age, where in the world it cur common welfare ?
DEM.
Alas!
wretch that I am!
I'm undone.
EUT.
The young men are more in the habit of giving their attention to following those pursuits.
DEM.
Troth, now, prithee, do take her to yourselves, with pigs and with basket1.
EUT.
Restore her to your son;
let him have her, now, as he wishes.
DEM.
So far as I'm concerned, he may have her.
EUT.
High time, i' faith, since you haven't the power of doing otherwise.
DEM.
For this injury let him take what satisfaction he likes ;
only do you make peace, I beg of you, that he mayn't be angry with me.
I' faith, if I had known it, or if, indeed, he had told me in the slightest way of joke that he was in love with her, I should never have proceeded to take her away from him so in love.
Eutychus, you are his com­ panion, preserve and rescue me, I beg of you.
Make this old fellow your client.
You shall say that I'm mindful of a kindness.
LYS.
Entreat him that he'll pardon his offences and his youthful age2.DEM.
Heyday now, are you still persisting in inveighing against me with your airs ?
I trust that a like opportunity will befall me as well for returning you a similar compliment.
LYS.
I've long made an end of those pursuits.
DEM.
And really so shall I from this time forward.
LYS.
Not a bit of it.
Through usage your inclinations will be leading you to it again.
DEM.
Prithee, do now be satisfied.
Rather, scourge me with thongs even, if you like.
LYS.
You say right.
But that your wife will do, when she comes to know of this.
DEM.
There's no need for her to come to know of it.
EUT.
What's that ?
She shan't come to know of it ;
don't be afraid.
Let's go in-doors ;
this place isn't a suitable one for your practices, for there to be persons to overhear who are passing through the street, while we are talking.
DEM.
Why, faith, you say what's right;
that way the story will be shorter.
Let's be off.
BUT.
Your son is in-doors here at our house.
DEM.
It's very good.
We'll pass that way through the garden1 home.
LYS.
Eutychus, I want this affair to be settled before I set my foot again within doors.
BUT.
What is it ?
LYS.
Each person thinks about his own concerns.
Answer me this:
do you know for certain that your mother isn't angry with me ?
EUT.
I do know it.
LYS.
Take care.
EUT.
Trust me for it.
Are you satisfied ?
LYS.
I am.
But still, troth now, prithee, do take care.
BUT.
Don't you believe me LYS.
Yes, I do believe you;
but still I'm dreadfully afraid.
DEM.
Let's go in-doors.
EUT.
Aye, but I think we must pronounce the law for the old men before we depart, on what terms they are to keep check upon themselves and to be continent.
Whoever shall be sixty years of age, if we know of any one, whether husband or, i' faith, whether bachelor, in fact, who goes a wenching, upon these terms shall we deal with him;
we shall deem him a fool.
And, i' faith, so far as we're concerned, he shall be in want who has squandered away his property.
And let no one hereafter forbid his youthful son to be in love and to keep a mistress, so it be done in a decent manner.
If he shall forbid him, let him, unknown to himself, suffer more loss than if he had openly permitted him.
Let this law, then, from this night forward, be binding upon the old men.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Young men, kindly fare you well;
and if this law, enacted for the sake of the old ones, pleases you, it is right that you should give us loud applause.
THE GOD OF HELP, who speaks the Prologue in the Second ActPHANOSTRATA, wife of Demipho.
SILENIUM, their daughter, beloved by Alcesimarchus.
HALISCA, her servant.
A PROCURESS, the mother of Gymnasium.
GYMNASIUM, a Courtesan.
Scene.—Sicyon, in Peloponnesus.
Before the houses of DEMIPHO, SILENILE.
and the father of ALCESIMARCHUS.
DEMIPHO, a merchant of Lemnos, having ravished Phanostrata, a ycung woman of Sicyon, she is brought to bed of a female child.
This she gives to her servant Lampadiscus, to be exposed.
On this being done, in the sight of Lampadiscus, a Procuress picks up the infant, and afterwards makes a present of it to her friend Melænis, by whom it is brought up, under the name of Silenium.
Al­ cesimarchus, a young man of Sicyon, falls violently in love with her, and takes her under his protection.
In the meantime, Demipho, who has married another wife, after her death marries Phanostrata, and comes to live at Sicyon.
He and his wife are then anxious, if possible, to regain their lost child.
The daughter of Demipho by his first wife is destined by her father to become the wife of Alcesimarchus;
on hearing which, Melænis removes her foster-child from his protection.
At this conjuncture Lampadiscus finds out the Pro­ curess that had taken up the infant when exposed, and from her discovers that the child of his mistress is with Melænis.
He informs his mistress of this, while Melænis is, unknown to them, standing by;
upon which she deter­ mines to confess the truth, and to restore Sileninm to her parents.
While she is thinking upon this plan, Alcesimarchus lays hands on Silenium, and carries her off to his father's house.
In the confusion attendant on this, Halisca, the servant of Melænis, drops a casket in the street, containing some trinkets which had been worn by Silenium at the time when she was exposed.
Phanostrata and Lampadiscus find the casket, and on Halisca coming to search for it, they dis­ cover where Silenium is.
They go into the house, and Phanostrata discovers ner long-lost child.
A YOUNG man of Lemnos ravishes (Comprimit) a woman of Sicyon.
He (Is) returns to his country, and becomes father of a daughter by his marriage there.
The woman of Sicyon (Sicyonia) also bears a daughter.
A servant takes (Tollit) and exposes her, and keeps watch in secret;
her (Earn), taken up, a Courtesan presents to another.
Coming back afterwards from Lemnos (Lemno), he marries her whom he had ravished;
and his daughter born at Lemnos (Lemni) he promises in marriage to a young man captivated by passion (Amore) for the one that had been exposed.
On making enquiry (Requirens), the servant finds her whom he bad exposed;
and so (Itaque) legally and properly does Alcesimarchus (A lcesimarchus) gain her recognized as a tree woman, whom before he had had as a concubine.
SIL.
Inasmuch as hitherto I have loved you, and have deemed you to be my friend, my dear Gymnasium, and your mother as well;
so have you shown it to me this day, both you and she.
If you had been my own sister, how more you two could possibly have held me in esteem I know not;
but, according as is my way of thinking, I conceive it could not possibly be, such ready assistance, all other things laid aside, have you given me.
For this reason do I love you, and for it a vast obligation have you both conferred upon me.
GYM.
I' faith, at such a price as this, indeed, it's easy for us to give you our attendance and to do you good offices;
so handsomely and so elegantly have you entertained us at breakfast at your house, as we shall ever remember.
SIL.
It has been done with hearty good will by me, and will be done, to get those things which I shall think you are desirous of.
PROC.
As the man said, who was borne by a prospering breeze on a calm sea:
“I rejoice that we camel to you;
" in such a delightful manner have we been here this day received;
nor except in the management, was there anything there at your house but what pleased me.
PROC.
Too seldom did the servant give me something to drink, and, as it was, it clouded the colour of the wine.
GYM.
Pray, is that becoming to be mentioned here PPROC.
It's both right and proper;
there's no other person here.
SIL.
With reason do I love you both.
who esteem and honor me.
PROC.
I' faith, my dear Silenium, it befits this class to be kindly disposed among themselves, and carefully to keep up friendships, when you see these matrons of elevated rank, born of the noblest families, how they value friendship, and how carefully they keep it united between themselves.
If we do that same thing, if we imitate the same example, still as it is, with difficulty do we exist with their extreme dis­ like.
Of their own enjoyments they would have us to be in want, in resources of our own they would have us not to pos­ sess any power, and to stand in need of them in all matters, that we may be their humble servants2.
If you wait upon them, you'd rather be giving your room than your company.
So very kind are they before the world to our class;
in pri. vate, if ever there's the opportunity, underhandedly they pour cold water3 upon us.
They declare that we are in the habit of having commerce with their husbands;
they say that we are their supplanters;
they attempt to crush us.
Because we are the free daughters of slaves4, both I and your mother, we became Courtesans;
she brought up yourself, and I this girl (pointing to GYMNASIUM), by chance-fathers.
Nor yet for the sake of vanity have I driven her to the calling of a Courtesan, but that I mightn't starve.
SIL.
But it had been better to give her in marriage to a husband in preference.
PROC.
Heyday, now!
Surely, faith, she's married to a bus.
band every day;
she has both been married to one to-day, she'll be marrying again to-night.
I've never allowed her to go to bed a widow.
For if she weren't to be marrying, the household would perish with doleful famine.
GYM.
It behoves me, mother, to be just as you wish I should be.
PROC.
I' troth, I don't regret it, if you will prove such as you say you'll be;
for if, indeed, you shall be such as I intend, vou'll never be a Hecalel in your old age, and you'll ever keep that same tender age which you now have, and you'll prove a loss to many and a profit to myself full oft, without any outlay of my own.
GYM.
May the Gods grant it.
PROC.
Without your own energies2, the Gods cannot pos­ sibly do anything in this.
GYM.
I' faith, for my own part, I'll zealously devote my energies to it.
But what mean you amid this conversation, apple of my eye, my own Silenium ?
(never did I see you more Bad;
) prithee, do tell me, why does mirth so shun you .
And you are not so neat as you usually are.
(SILENIUM sighs.)
Do look at that, please, how deep a sigh she heaved.
You are pale too.
Tell us both what's the matter with you, and in what you want our aid;
so that we may know.
Prithee, don't by your tears be causing me anxiety.
SIL.
My dear Gymnasium, I'in sadly affected;
I feel ill, I am shockingly distrest;
I am pained in spirits, I feel pain in my eyes, I am in pain from faintness.
What shall I say, but that my own folly drives me to sadness ?
GYM.
Take you care, then, that you have your folly en­ tombed in that very same place from which it takes its rise.
SIL.
What shall I do ?
GYM.
Hide it in darkness, in the very deepest recesses of your breast.
Take you care and have it so, that you yourself are alone sensible of your own folly, without any other witnesses.
SIL.
But I've got the heart-ache.
GYM.
Why so?
For what reason have you the heart- ache, prithee, tell me, a thing that I neither have, nor any other woman whatever, according as the men say ?
SIL.
If there's any heart to feel pain, it does feel pain;
but if there isn't, still this pains me here.
(Pointing to her left-side.)PROC.
This woman's in love.
GYM.
Come now, to begin to be in love, is it bitter, prithee ?
PROC.
Why, troth, love is most fruitful both in honey and in gall;
inasmuch as it produces sweetness in a mere taste, but causes bitterness even to repletion.
SIL.
Of that character is the malady that afflicts me, my dear Gymnasium.
GYM.
Love is full of treachery.
SIL.
He's taking his spoils of me, then.
GYM.
Be of good courage, you'll get the better of this malady.
SIL.
I trust it will be so, if the physician comes that can administer the medicine to this malady.
GYM.
He will come.
SIL.
A hard expression is that to one in love, “He will come," unless he does come.
But by my own fault and foolishness, am I, wretched creature, more afflicted, because for him alone have I longed for myself, with whom to pass my life.
PROC.
That is more suitable to a married woman, my dear Silenium, to love but one, and with him to pass her life, to whom she has once been married;
but, indeed, a Courtesan is most like a flourishing city;
she cannot alone increase her fortunes without a multitude of men.
SIL.
1 want you to give heed to this matter;
the thing on account of which you have been sent for to me, I'll disclose.
Now, my mother, because I don't wish myself to be called a Courtesan, complied with my desire;
in that matter she indulged myself who have been obedient to her;
to allow me to live with him alone whom I so ardently loved.
PROC.
I' faith, she acted foolishly.
But look, have you ever kept company with any man ?
SIL.
With no one, indeed, except Alcesimarchus;
nor has any other person whatever committed an infringement on my chastity.
PROC.
Prithee, by what means did this maa gain your good graces ?
SIL.
At the festival of Bacchus my mother took me to see the procession.
While I was returning home, from a secret look-out he secretly traced me even to the door;
after that, he insinuated himself into the friendship of my mother and my­ self as well, by endearments, presents, and gifts.
PROC.
I should like a man of that sort to be offered me.
How I'd work him.
SIL.
What need is there of words ?
Through intercourse, I on the other hand began to love him, and he myself.
PROC.
0 my dear Silenium !
SIL.
What's the matter ?
PROC.
You ought to pretend to be in love;
for if you fall in love at once, you'll be much better consulting the interests of him whom you love than your own.
SIL.
But in solemn form he took an oath before my mother that he would take me as his wife.
Now, another woman is about to be taken home by him, a Lemnian lady, his relation, who is living here hard by (pointing to DEMIPH'S house) ;
for his father has compelled him.
Now my mother is enraged with me, because I didn't return home to her, when I came to know of this matter, that he was about to take another as his wife.
PROC.
Nothing's unfair in love.
SIL.
Now, I entreat you that you'll let her (pointing to GYMNASIUM) be here only for the next three days, and keep house for me ;
for I've been sent for to my mother's house.
PROC.
Although this will be a troublesome three days for me, and you'll be causing me a loss, I'll do so.
SIL.
You act kindly and like a friend.
But you, my dear Gymnasium, if in my absence Alcesimarchus shall come, don't you chide him roughly;
however he has deserved of myself, still he has my affections;
but, prithee, act gently, so that you mayn't say anything that may cause him pain.
Take the keys (giving them to her) ;
if you have need to take out any­ thing for use, take it out.
I wish to goGYM. (weeping).
How you have drawn tears from me.
SIL.
My dear Gymnasium, kindly, farewell.
GYM.
Take care of yourself, there's a dear.
Prithee, will you go in this dishabille ?
(Pointing to her dress.)SIL.
It'a right that such neglect should attend upon my prospects thus disarranged.
GYM.
At least do lift up that outer garmentl..
SIL.
Let it be dragged, while I myself am being dragged down.
GYM.
Since so it pleases you, fare you well and prosper.
SIL.
If I could, I would.
(Exit.GYM.
Mother, do you wish anything of me, before I go in- doors P Upon my faith, to me she does seem to be in love.
PROC.
For this reason, then, it is, that I'm repeatedly din­ ning it into your ears, not to be in love with any man.
Go in-doors.
GYM.
Do you wish anything of me ?
PROC.
That you may fare well.
GYM.
Fare you well.
(GYMNASIUM goes into the house of SILENIUM.)PROC. (to the AUDIENCE).
It's the same fault with myself us with a great part of us women who are following this call­ ing ;
who, as soon as ever we have got our load of food, are forthwith full of talk;
more than is enough do we say.
Why, myself now, inasmuch as I'm filled to my heart's content, and because I've charged myself quite full of the choicest of wine, it pleases me to use my tongue more at freedom;
to my misfortune I can't keep silent on that which it were ne­ cessary to be silent upon.
But once upon a time, that girl, who has gone hence in tears, from a lane I carried off a little child exposed.
There is here a certain youth, of the highest rank;
his father, of a very high family, is living at Sicyon2;
he is dying desperately in love for this young woman, who has just now gone hence in tears;
on the other hand, she is smitten with love.
I made a present of her to my friend, this Courtesan:
who bad often made mention of it to me that somewhere I must find for her a boy or a girl, just born, that she herself might pass it off as her own.
As soon as ever the opportuuity befell me, I immediately granted her request in that which she had asked of me.
After she had received this female child from me, at once she was brought to bed of the same female child which she had received from me, without the aid of a midwife and without pain, just as other women bring forth, who seek a trouble to themselves;
but she said that her lover was a foreigner, and that by reason of that circum­ stance she was palming it off.
This, we two alone are aware of, I who gave the child to her, and she who received it from me;
(to the AUDIENCE) except yourselves, indeed.
Thus was this affair managed;
if any occasion should arise, I wish you to remember this circumstance.
I'm off home.
(-Exit.(To the AUDIENCE.)
This old woman is both a much-talker and a much-tippler.
Isn't it the fact that she has hardly left room to a Divinity for him to speak, so much has she forestalled him in talking about the substitution of this girl ?
But if she had held her tongue, still I was about to mention it-a God, who could do it better;
for my name is Help.
Now (to the AUDIENCE) lend your attention, that I may clearly explain this plot to you.
Some time since, at Sicyon, there was the Festival of Bacchus;
a merchant of Lemnos2 came hither to the games, and he, an ungovernable young man, ravished a maidens in the dark, in the street, at the dead of night.
He, as he knew that be was deserving of a heavy punishment, at once found shelter with his heels, and made off for Lemnos, where he then lived.
She whom he had ravished, the ninth ensuing month completed, brought forth a daughter here4.
Since she did not know the person guilty of this deed, who he was, she made the servant5 of her father partaker of her counsels, and gave to that servant the child to be ex­ posed to death.
He exposed it;
this woman took up the child;
that servant, who had exposed it, secretly took note whither or to what house she carried away the child.
As you have heard her own self confess, she gave this child to the Courtesan Melænis;
and she brought her up as being her own daughter, honestly and virtuously.
But then, this Lem­ nian married a neighbour there, his relation, for his wife.
She departed this life;
there she was compliant to her hus­ band.
After he had performed the due obsequies to his wife, at once he removed hither;
here he married for his wife that same woman1 whom formerly,when a maid, he ravished.
When he understood that it was she whom he had ravished, she told him that, in consequence of the violation, she had brought forth a daughter, and had at once given her to a servant to be exposed.
He forthwith ordered this same servant to make enquiries, if anyhow he could discover who had taken it up.
Now to that task is the servant always assiduously de­ voting his attention, if he can find out that Courtesan, whom formerly, when he himself exposed her, he from his hiding- place had seen take her up.
Now, what remains unpaid, I wish to discharge, that my name may be struck out, so that I mayn't remain a debtor.
A young man2 is here at Sicyon, his father is alive;
with affection he distractedly dotes upon this exposed girl, who just now went hence in tears unto her mother;
and she loves him in return, which is the most delight­ ful love of all.
As human matters go, nothing is granted for everlasting:
the father is wishful to give the young man a wife.
When the motherS came to know of this, she ordered her to be sent for home.
Thus have these matters come to pass.
Kindly fare you well, and conquer by inborn valour, as you have done before;
defend your allies, both ancient ones and new;
increase resources by your righteous laws ;
destroy your foes;
laud and laurels gather;
that, conquered by you, the Poeni4 may suffer the penalty.
(Exit.ALC.
I do believe that Love was the first to invent torture among mankind.
This conjecture do I form from myself at home, not to go seek it out of doors;
I, who surpass all men, exceed them in the pangs of my feelings.
I'm tossed, tor­ mented, agitated, goaded, whirled on the wheel of love in my misery, I'm deprived of sensation, carried one way, carried another way, I'm torn and rent asunder;
such clouded faculties of mind have I, where I am, there I am not;
where I am not, there my thoughts are;
to such a degree have I now all kinds of feelings in me;
what I like, then all at once I like not the same;
so much does love trifle with me changing my mind, drive me, pursue, desire, and seize for itself, retain, trepan, and promise;
what it gives, it gives not;
it deludes me;
what this moment it has persuaded me, it now dissuades me from ;
what it has dissuaded me from, it now points out to me that same.
After the manner of the sea is it experienced by me;
so much does it distract my enamoured feelings;
and only in that, in my misery, I do not sink utterly, is there any evil removed from me thus ruined;
in such a way has my father detained me these six days running in the country, at his house there;
nor has it been allowed me in the meantime to visit my mistress.
Isn't this dreadful to relate ?
MEL.
Are you joking for this reason, because you've got another wife engaged, a rich lady of Lemnos ?
Have her then!
We are neither of a family so great as you are, nor is our wealth so substantial as yours;
but still I have no fears that any one will impeach our oath;
you then, if you shall feel any pain, will know for what reason you do feel pain.
ALC.
May the Gods confound me—— MEL.
Whatever you wish for, I desire it may befall you.
ALC.
If ever I'll marry that wife which my father has en­ gaged for me.
MEL.
And me, if ever I give you my daughter for a wife.
ALC.
Will you allow me to be forsworn ?
MEL.
Tes, and a little more easily than myself and my affairs to go to ruin, and my daughter to be trifled with.
Begone !
go seek where there is confidence enough in your oaths ;
here now, with us, Alcesimarchus, you've renounced your title!
to our friendship.
ALC.
Make trial of me but once..
MEL.
I have made that trial full oft;
which I lament has been so made.
ALC.
Give her back to me.
MEL.
Under new circum­ stances I'll use an old proverb:
" What I have given, I wish I had not given;
what's left, that I shall not give."ALC.
Won't you restore her again to me ?
MEL.
Answer yourself for me.
ALC.
You won't restore her then ?
MEL.
You know the whole of my resolution already.
ALC.
Is that quite resolved upon by you in your heart ?
MEL.
Why, in fact, I'm thinking about something else;
i' faith, I don't at present catch these words of yours with my ears.
ALC.
Not hear ?
Why, what are you doing ?
MEL.
Then do you give heed at once, that you may know what you are doing.
ALC.
Then, so may the Gods and Goddesses of above and below, and of middle rank1, and so may Juno the queen and the daughter2 of supreme Jove, and so may Saturn his uncle——MEL.
I' troth, his fatherALC.
And so may Ops the opulent, his grandam-MEL.
Indeed, his mother, rather.
ALC.
Juno his daughter, and Saturn his uncle, supreme Jove—You are maddening me;
it's through you I make these mistakes.
MEL.
Go on saying so.
ALC.
Is it that I'm to know3 what conclusion you are going to come to ?
MEL.
Go on talking;
I shall not send her back, that's resolved upon.
ALC.
Why then, so may Jupiter, and so may Juno and Saturn, to me, so may—I don't know what to say-Now I know-Yes, madam, listen, that you may know my mind;
may all the Deities, great and small, and those hone red with the platterl * * * cause me not sur­ viving to give a kiss this day to Silenium, if I don't this very day murder you and your daughter and myself, and after that, with the break of day, if I don't to-morrow kill you both, and indeed, by all the powers, if at the third onset I don't demolish you all, if you don't send her back to me.
I've said what I intended.
Farewell.
(Goes into his FATHER'S house.)LAM. (to himself).
I've followed the old woman with my clamour through the streets;
I've kept her most dreadfully plagued.
In what a multitude of ways has she, this day, kept guard upon herself, and been able to remember nothing.
How many alluring things, what advantages I've promised her.
How many inventions I've applied to her, how many stratagems in questioning her.
With difficulty have I ex­ torted it from her that she should tell me, because I promised to give her a cask of wine.
PHAN. (to herself).
I seemed just now to be hearing the voice of my servant Lampadiscus before the house.
LAM. (stepping forward).
You are not deaf, mistress, you heard aright.
PHAN.
What are you doing here ?
LAM.
A thing for you to rejoice at.
PHAN.
What's that?
LAM. (pointing to the house of SILENIUM).
A little while ago, I saw a woman coming out of that house there.
PHAN.
Her that took up my daughter ?
LAM.
You have the matter right.
PHAN.
What after that ?
LAM.
I told her in what way I had seen her take up the daughter of my mistress from the Hippodrome.
Then she was in a fright.
MEL. (apart).
Now my body's in a shudder, my heart is throbbing;
for I recollect that from the Hippodrome the little female infant was brought to me, and that I brought it up as my own.
PHAN.
Come, prithee, do go on;
my soul's longing to hear how the matter proceeded.
MEL. (apart).
I only wish you couldn't hear.
LAM.
I proceed ✻ ✻ ✻ saying1, “This old woman calls you her daughter wrongfully.
* ✻ * ✻ ✻ ✻ ✻ ✻
For this woman here is your foster-mother, so don't think she is your mother.
I'm to take you back and invite you to opulence, where you may be settled in a noble family, where your father may present you with twenty great talents for a por­ tion.
For this is not a place where after the Etrurian mode2 you are disgracefully to earn a dowry for yourself by prosti­ tution of your person."
PHAN.
Is she, pray, a Courtesan, who took it up ?LAM.
Yes, she was a Courtesan.
But how it happened, I'll tell you about that matter.
I was now winning her over to me by my persuasion.
The old woman embraced her knees, weeping and entreating that she would not forsake her;
saying that she was her own daughter;
and she took a solemn oath to me that she herself had borne her.
" Her," said she, " whom you are in search of, I gave to a friend of mine to bring her up as her own daughter;
and she is alive," said she. "
Where is she ?" immediately said I.PHAN.
Preserve me, ye Gods, I do entreat you.
MEL. (apart).
But me you are undoing!
PHAN.
You ought to have enquired to whom she gave it.
LAM.
I did enquire, and she said to the Courtesan Melænis.MEL. (apart).
He has mentioned my name?
I'm utterly undone!
LAM.
When she mentioned her, I straightway asked, "Where does she live?" said I;
" take and show me."
"She has been carried off hence," says she, " to live abroad."
MEL.
He's sprinklingl a little cold water now.
LAM. "
Wherever she has been carried off, thither we will follow.
Do you trifle in this fashion?
You are undone, if, i' faith, you don't disclose this."
I insisted to such a degree, that the old woman swore that she would soon in­ form me.
PHAN.
But you oughtn't to have let her go.
LAM.
She's all safe;
but she said that she wished first to meet a certain woman, a friend of hers, with whom this was a matter of interest in common, and I'm sure she'll come.
MEL. (apart).
She'll be discovering me, and adding her own distress to mine.
PHAN.
Make me acquainted what you now wish me to do.
LAM.
Go in-doors, and be of good heart.
If your hus­ band shall come, bid him wait at home, lest he should be required by me, if I want him for anything.
I'm going to run back to the old woman.
LAM.
I'll have this matter well managed.
PHAN.
I trust in the Gods and in yourself.
LAM.
And I in the same — that you'll now go home.
(PHANO STRATA goes into her house.)MEL. (coming forward).
Young man, stay and listen.
LAM.
What, are you calling to me, woman ?
MEL.
To you.
LAM.
What's the matter ?
For I'm fully engaged.
MEL. (Pointing to the house of DEMIPHO).
Who lives there ?
LAM.
Demipho, my master.
MEL.
It is he, I suppose, that has betrothed his daugh­ ter with such great wealth to Alcesimarchus ?
LAM.
It is he himself.
MEL.
HOW now, you?
What other daughter, then, are you people now in search of ?
LAM.
I'll tell you ;
not his daughter by his wife, but his wife's daughter.
MEL.
What's the meaning of that speech ?
LAM.
By a former woman, I say, my master had a daugh­ ter born.
MEL.
Surely, just now you said you were in search of the daughter of her who has been talking here.
LAM.
Her daughter I am in search of.
MEL.
In what way then, pray, is she a "former woman," who is now his wife ?
LAM.
Woman, whoever you are, you weary me with your prating.
The middle woman1 whom he had for a wife, of her this maiden was born that's being given to Alcesimarchus.
That wife is dead.
Do you understand now PMEL.
I understand that quite well;
but it's this knotty point I'm enquiring about, how the first can be the last, the last be the first.
LAM.
The fact is this;
this woman he ravished before he took her home as his wife;
before that she was pregnant, and before that she gave birth to a daughter:
after she gave birth to her, she ordered the infant to be exposed ;
I myself exposed her;
another woman took her away;
I was on the look-out;
after that, my master married her.
That girl, her daughter, we are now in search of.
(MELÆNIS turns aside her head.)
Why now, with face upturned, are you looking up towards the heavens ?
MEL.
Now, then, be off at once whither you were hasten­ ing ;
I won't detain you;
I understand it now.
LAM.
I' troth, to the Deities I do give thanks ;
for if you hadn't understood me, I do think you would never have let me go.
(Exit.MEL. (to herself).
Now it's necessary for me to be honest, whether I will or no, although I had rather not;
I find the thing is discovered.
Now will I myself lay them under an obligation to me, rather than she shall peach upon me.
I'll go home, and I'll bring Silenium to her parents.
(Exit.MEL.
I've disclosed the whole matter to you ;
follow, my Silenium, that you may rather belong to those to whom you ought to belong, than be mine.
Although against my will I shall part with you, still I'll reconcile my mind to consult that which in especial conduces to your benefit.
(Giving her a casket.)
For here in this are the trinketsl, together with which she who gave you to me formerly brought you to me ;
that your parents may recognize you the more easily.
Take this casket, Halisca, and then go and knock at that door (pointing to the house of DEMIPHO) :
say that I request that some one will come from within.
Make haste, quickly.
ALO. (calling aloud).
Death, receive me unto thyself, a friend and well-wisher to me !
SIL.
My mother, to our sorrow, we are undone!
ALC. (aloud, to himself).
Whether shall I pierce my side here (striking his right side) or on the left.
MEL. (to SILENIUM).
What's the matter with you?
SIL. (pointing).
Don't you see Alcesimarchus?
He's grasp­ ing a sword.
ALC. (aloud, in afrantic manner).
What art about?
Thou art delaying.
Quit the light of day.
SIL.
Do run and aid him, pray, that he mayn't kill him­ self.
(They run to assist him, on which HALISCA drops the casket.)ALC.
0 Safety more healthful than my own safety, you now, whether I wish or don't wish, alone do cause me to live.
MEL.
Fie on it!
Were you ready to commit such violence ?
ALC.
I've nought to do with you—to you I'm dead.
(Clasping SILENIUM in his arms.)
Her, as I hold her, I'm de­ termined not to lose.
For, by heaven, I am resolved hence- forth to have her entirely rivetted fast unto me.
(Goes to the door of the house, and calls.)
Where are you, servants ?
Shut the door with bolts, with bars, when I shall have carried her within the threshold!
(He carries SILENIUM into the house, followed by HALISCA.)MEL.
(exclaiming, while wringing her hands).
He's gone off:
he has carried the damsel away.
I'll go—I'll at once fallow him in-doors, that he may know of me these same hings, if from being angered with me I can render him pleased.
(Goes into the house.)LAM.
I do believe I never saw a more tormenting old nag than this is.
What she just now confessed to me, is che to be denying it?
But look, I see my mistress.
Why (seeing the casket on the ground), how's this, that this casket is lying here with these trinkets, and that I see no other person in the street ?
I must act the child's part1;
I'll stoop to pick up the casket.
(Picks it up.)PHAN.
What are you about, Lampadio ?LAM.
(giving the casket to PHANO STRATA).
Is this casket from out of our house here, I wonder.
For I picked it up, lying here near the door.
PITAN.
What news do you bring about the old woman ?
LAM.
That there's not one other on earth more wicked.
She denies all those things which she just now confessed to me.
But, i' faith, for me to allow that old jade to be laugh­ ing at me, it's preferable for me to die by any kind of death.
PHAN.
Ye Gods, I do adjure you by our trust in you!
(Opening the casket.)LAM.
Why do you call upon the Gods ?
PHAN.
Save us!
LAM.
What's the matter ?
PHAN.
These arc the trinkets with which you exposed my little daughter to death.
LAM.
Are you in your senses ?
PHAN.
These certainly are.
LAM.
Do you persist ?
PHAN.
These are they.
LAM.
If any other woman were to speak to me after that fashion, I should say she was drunk.
PHAN.
By heaven!
I'm talking no nonsense.
But pri­ thee, whence in the world did these come, or what Deity placed this before our door ?
As though for a given purpose, at the very instant sacred Hope comes to my aid ?HAL. (to herself).
Unless the Gods give me some aid, I'm utterly undone;
nor do I know whence I am to seek for aid.
To such a degree does carelessness possess wretched me in mind, which I sadly fear may be lighting upon my own back, if my mistress knows that I'm so negligent as I really am.
The casket which I took and held in my hands here before the door, where it is I know not;
except, as I fancy, it was dropt by me about this spot.
(Looks about on the ground.)
My good sirs (to the AUDIENCE), my kind Spectators, do give me information if any one has seen it, if any one has taken it away, or any one picked it up;
and whether in this direction or that he has taken his departure ?
(She pauses for a reply.)
I'm none the wiser for asking these persons, or for worrying them, who are always delighted at a woman's mishaps.
Now I'll mark if there are any foot­ steps here;
for if no one had passed this way since I went in-doors, the casket would be lying here.
Why say " here ?"
It's lost, I guess;
it's done for.
It's all over with unhappy and unlucky me!
It's nowhere, and nowhere am I.
This, by its loss, has proved my loss.
But still, as I've begun, I'll' e'en go on ;
I'll make search;
for both within do I fear, and without I am afraid;
so much, on either side, does fear agitate me now.
In this are mortals intensely wretched.
He is now joyous, whoever he is, that has found it, which is of no use at all to any person else;
to myself it may be.
But I cause delay to myself, while I'm doing this with remissness.
Halisca, attend to what you are about:
look down upon the ground, and look round about;
search with your eyes;
guess with shrewdness.
LAM. (apart, at a distance).
Mistress!PHAN. (apart).
Well, what's the matter?
LAM. (apart).
That's she.
(Pointing at HALISCA.)PHAN. (apart).
Who?LAM. (apart.)
She who let fall the casket.
Why surely she's tracing out that spot where it fell.
PHAN. (apart.)
It seems so.
HAL. (to herself, looking on the ground).
But that person has gone this way;
this way I perceive the imprint of his shoe1;
this way I'll follow him.
(She moves along, still looking on the ground.)
In this spot now has he stopped, along with another person.
Here now a circle2 presents itself to my sight, nor did he go straight for­ ward this way;
here he came to a pause.
This way did he come out of that circle.
Here was a conference with some one.
It points to two persons now.
Who are these ?
Hey­ day !
I see the footsteps of only one.
But he has gone this way.
I'll consider it:
hither he went from thence;
from hence he has never gone.
I'm troubling myself to no pur­ pose.
What's lost is lost;
my hide3 along with the casket.
I'll go in-doors again.
( Going towards the house of the FATHER of ALCESIMARCHUS.)PHAN. (calling out).
Hallo, woman-stop;
there are some persons who wish to meet with you.
HAL.
Who's calling me back ?
LAM.
A good female and a bad male want you.
HAL.
Away with you, bad male;
I want a good one.
(To herself.)
After all, he who calls knows better what he wants than I who am called;
I'll return.
(Aloud.)
Prithee, have you seen any person hereabouts pick up a casket with some trinkets, which I, to my misfortune, have lost here ?
For when, just now, we were running into the nouse of Alce­ simarchus, that he mightn't put an end to his life, at that moment I think that, through terror, the casket fell down from me here.
LAM. (aside to PHANOSTRATA).
This woman's to our pur­ pose ;
let's then give heed to her a little, mistress.
HAL.
To my sorrow, I'm utterly undone.
What shall I say to my mistress, who bade me with such earnestness take care of it, through which Silenium might the more readily recognize her parents-who, when little, was adopted by my mistress as her own, and whom a certain Courtesan gave to her?
LAM. (aside).
She's talking about this matter of ours.
According as she gives these indications by her talk, she must surely know where your daughter is.
HAL.
Now is she desirous of her own accord to restore her to her father and mother, whose daughter she is;
prithee, my good sir, you are attending to something else;
I commend my matter to you.
LAM.
I'm giving my attention to this, and this is as good as food to me, that you are talking of;
but amid my attend­ ing to this matter, I was answering this mistress of mine what she was enquiring;
now I return to you, If you have need of anything, say you, and give your orders.
What were you looking for ?
HAI.
My good sir and my good madam, I greet you.
PHAN.
And we you.
But what are you looking for ?
HAL.
I'm tracing footsteps here, the way that something has escaped me here, I don't know how.
PHAN.
What is it ?
LAM.
What is it, pray ?
HAL.
Something to bring a loss to another, and a cala­ mity on our family.
LAM. (aside to PHANOSTRATA).
A worthless baggage is this, mistress, and a crafty one.
FRAN. (aside).
I' faith, and so she seems.
LAM. (aside).
She imitates a worthless animal and a mis­ chievous.
PHAN. (aside).
Which one, prithee ?
LAM. (aside).
A caterpillar, which twisting about winds itself in the leaf of the vine;
just in the same way does she begin a story that twists about.
(To HALISCA.)
What are you looking for?
HAL.
A casket, my good young man, has flown away from me here.
LAM.
You ought to have put it in a cage.
HAL.
I' faith, the booty was no great one.
LAM.
It's a wonder, if a whole troop of slaves1 isn't there ir the casket.
PHAN.
Do let her speak.
LAM.
If indeed she would speak.
PHAN. (to HALISCA).
Come say you, what was in it ?
HAL.
Trinkets only.
LAM.
There's a certain man, who declares that he knows where it is.
HAL.
But, by my faith, he'll confer an obligation on a certain woman if he'll discover it.
LAM.
But this certain man wishes a reward to be given to him.
HAL.
But, by my faith, this certain woman, that has lost this casket, declares that she has nothing to give to this cer­ tain man.
LAM.
But still this certain man looks for some money.
HAL.
But still he looks for it in vain.
LAM.
But, by my faith, good woman, in no matter does this certain man give his pains for nothing.
PHAN.
Lend me your conversation:
it will now be for your own advantage.
We confess that we have got the casket.
HAL.
Then may Salvation preserve you;
where is it now ?• PHAN. (producing the casket).
See, here it is, safe.
But I wish to discourse with you upon a matter of importance to myself;
I take you as a sharer with me in my own preserva­ tion.• HAL.
What matter is this, or who are you ?
PRAN.
I am the mother of her who had these things with her, when exposed.
HAL.
Do you live here then ?
(Pointing to the house.)PHAN.
You are a diviner.
But, prithee, good woman, do lay aside all mystification, and to the point;
tell me at once, whence did you get these trinkets ?
HAL.
This daughter of my mistress had them.• LAM.
You tell a falsehood;
for my own mistress's daughter had them, not yours.
PHAN.
Don't interrupt.
LAM.
I'll be mum.
PHAN.
Good woman, go on speaking.
Where is she who had them ?
HAL.
-pointing to the house of ALCESIMARCHUS).
Here, next door.
PHAN.
By the powers, surely the son-in-taw of my husband is living there.
LAM.
Surely—— PHAN. (to LAMPADISCUS).
Interrupting again ? (To HALISCA.)
Go on relating it.
How many years old is she said to be ?
HAL.
Seventeen.
PHAN.
She is my own daughter then !
LAM.
'Tis she, as the number of her years has proved.
HAL.
What you are seeking, you have found;
I now seek what's mine.
LAM.
Why, faith, they've found what's their own, I'll seek for number three1.
PHAN.
My daughter, the object which I was seeking, I have discovered.
HAL.
It's proper to keep in safety what has been entrusted in confidence, lest a kindness should turn out a detriment to the well-deserving.
This fosterling of ours is assuredly your daughter, and my mistress is about to restore you your own, and for that purpose has she come from her house.
But, prithee, enquire of her own self;
I am but a servant.
PHAN.
You ask what's just.
HAL.
To her rather do I choose this obligation to belong.
But I beg that you'll restore me that casket.
PHAN.
What's to be done, Lampadio ?
LAM.
What's your own, keep as your own.
PHAN.
But I feel compassion for her.
LAM.
This I think ought to be done ;
give her the casket, and go in-doors together with her.
PHAN.
I'll follow your advice.
(Giving it to HALISCA.)
Take you the casket.
Let's go in-doors.
But what's the name of your mistress ?
HAL.
Melænis.
PHAN.
Go first;
I'll follow you at once.
(Exit LAMPADISCUS, and the others go into the house oj the FATHER of ALCESIMARCHUS.)DEM.
What affair is this, that all persons are talking about in the street-that my daughter has been fouud ?
They say, too, that Lampadiol has been seeking me in the Forum.
LAM.
Master, whence come you P DEM.
From the Senate.
LAM.
I rejoice that through my means there is an addition to your children.
DEM.
But it don't please me;
I don't want that I should be having more children by means of another person.
But what is the meaning of this PLAM.
(pointing to the house of the FATHER of ALCESIMAR­ CHUS).
Make haste, and go in-doors here to the house of your neighbour;
you'll at once recognize your daughter.
Your wife's in-doors there as well.
Go quickly.
DEM.
I'm resolved that this shall, before all other matters, be attended to.
(They go into the house of the FATHER of ALCESIMARCHUS.)
Don't you wait, Spectators, till they come out to you;
DO one will come out;
they'll all finish the business in- doors ;
when that shall be done, they'll lay aside their dress;
then, after that, he that has done amiss will get a beating2 ;
he that has not done amiss will get some drink.
Now as to what's left, Spectators, for you to do, after the manner of your ancestors, give your applause at the conclu­ sion of the Play.

—Athens;
before the houses of PHRONESIUM and of the father of STRABAXPHRONESIUM, a Courtesan, has three admirers—Dinarchus, a dissipated young Athenian;
Strabax, a young man from the country;
and Stratophanés, an officer in the Babylonian army.
To impose upon the last, she palms off a child upon him, pretending that it is hers, and that he is the father of it.
In the first part of the Play, Dinarchus returns from abroad, and is admitted by the ser­ vant Astaphinm into the house of Phronesium.
After this, Astaphium goes to the house where Strabax lives, to invite him to visit Phronesium, but is roughly repulsed by Stratilax, his servant.
Dinarchus quits the house of Phronesium, not having been allowed to see her, on the excuse that she is at the bath.
Phronesium at length comes out, and, in their conversation, tells Dinarchus that she is pretending to have been pregnant by the Captain Stra­ tophanes, and has procured a child to pass off as his.
She also begs Dinar­ chus to make her a present, which he promises to do, and then takes his leave.
She then gets everything in readiness to look as though she had just lain in.
The Captain arrives from abroad, and produces his presents;
but as ready money does not form a part of them, Phronesium expresses extreme dissatisfac­ tion and contempt.
At this moment Geta, the servant of Dinarchus, comes with his present, in money and provisions.
A quarrel ensues between the Cap­ tain and Geta, who at last takes to his heels, on which Phronesium goes into her house.
Strabax then arrives from the country with some ready money, and is admitted to visit Phronesium.
Stratilax comes to look for him, and after some parley falls a prey to the allurements of Astaphium.
Dinarchus then arrives, but, despite of his recent generosity, suffers a repulse.
Before he quits the stage, Callicles, an old gentleman, comes with two female-servants, whom be examines as to what they have done with a female child that his daughter haU' been recently delivered of.
They confess that they have carried it to Phrone­ sium to be passed off as her own, and that Dinarchus is really the father of it.
Dinarchus, in great alarm, overhears this conversation, and then accosts Cal­ licles, and, confessing his fault, offers to marry his daughter forthwith.
His offer is accepted;
on which he revisits Phronesium, to request her to restore to him the child.
She, however, prevails upon him to lend it to her for a few days, that she may fully carry out her design of imposing upon the Captain.
After this, Stratophanes appears again, and brings fresh presents.
He then has a quarrel with Strabax, and the Play ends by Phronesium promising to divide her favours between them both.
The text of this Play is in a most cor­ rupt state.
THREE (Tres) young men are desperately in love for the same woman-one from the country (Rure), another from the city, the third from abroad;
and tha (Utque) she may touch the Captain for a heavy haul, she secretly (Clam) passes off as her own a child that has been born by stealth.
A servant uses great violence (Vi) and churlish manners, that Courtesans (Lupæ) may not squander the savings of his master;
and (Et) yet he is softened.
The Cap­ tain arrives, and for the sake of the child (Nati) gives costly presents.
At length (Tandem), the father of her that has been debauched comes to know all, and agrees that (Utque) he shall marry her who has seduced her;
and he asks back his own (Suum) child that has been passed off by the Courtesan as hers.
A VERY small portion of room does Plautus ask from out of your vast and pleasant city within the walls, whither, without builders, he may transport Athens.
What then?
Will vou give it or not?
They nod assent.
I fancied, indeed, that I should obtain it of you without hesitation.
What if I were to ask something of your private means ?
They shake their heads.
Only see, i' faith, how the ancient habit still indwells among you, to keep your tongues ever ready for a denial.
But let's to the point, on account of which I came hither.
Let this be Athens, just as this is our stage, only for the while that we perform this Play.
Here (pointing to her house) dwells a female whose name is Phro­ nesium;
she has in herself the manners of the present age;
she never asks of her lover that which has been given;
but what is left, she does her best that it mayn't be left, by beg­ ging for it and carrying it off, as is the habit of the women;
for all of them do this when they discover that they are loved.
She is pretending to a Captain that she has been brought to bed, that the more speedily she may sweep away his property from him every atom.
Why say more?
If the life of this woman should only last, he will be sweeping off his sub­ stance with his very life into her hands.
* * * * * * * * * *DIN. (to himself)
Not a whole life is sufficient for a lover thoroughly to learn, until be has become full well aware of this, in how many modes he may come to ruin;
nor does Venus herself, in whose hands lie the sum and substance of covers, ever instruct us in that art of reckoning-in how many ways one in love may be deluded, in how many modes he may come to ruin, and with how many modes of entreaty he may be entreated.
How many blandishments are there in it, how many pettish ways in it, how many perils must be courted!
Ye Gods !
by our trust in you!
Hey!
what ground for perjury as well, besides the everlasting presents !
In the first place then, there's the yearly allowance;
that'a her first haul1.
For that the favour of three nights is granted.
In the meantime she's trying for either money, or wine, or oil, or corn, to prove whether you are lavish or thrifty.
Just like the person that throws a casting-net into a fish-pond;
when the net has gone and sunk, then he contracts the folds;
but if he has rightly thrown it, he takes care that the fish may not escape;
then in this direction and that does he enfold the fish netted well, until he has taken them out of the water:
just so is the lover.
If he gives that which is asked for, and is lavish rather than thrifty, nightly favours are given in addition.
Meanwhile he swallows down the hook.
If once he has partaken of the cup of love unmixed, and that draught has made its way within his breast, forthwith both himself is .ruined, and his fortune, and his credit.
If the mistress is angry with her lover perchance, doubly is the lover ruined, both in fortune and in mind;
but if one man is preferable to another in her eyes, just as much is he ruined;
if he enjoys but few of her favours, in mind is he ruined;
if he enjoys them in abundance, he himself is joyous, his fortunes are ruined.
* * *
Thus is it in the houses kept by procurers;
before you've given a single thing, she'a preparing a hundred to ask for;
either a golden trinket'a lost, or a martie has been torn, or a female servant bought;
or some silver vessel, or some vessel of brass, or expensive couch, or a Grecian cabinet, or there's always something to be lost and for the lover to be replacing for his mistress.
And with one common earnestness do we conceal these losses while we are losing our fortunes, and our credit, and ourselves, lest our parents or our relatives should know something;
whom, while we conceal it from them, if we were to make acquainted with it, for them in time to restrain our youthful age, we should be giving what has been received from them before to our descendants in reversion;
I'd be for causing, that as there are now more procurers and harlots, there should be fewer and fewer of spendthrift fellows than there are at present;
for now-a-days there are almost more procurers and harlots than flies at the time when it is most hot.
For, if they are nowhere else, the procurers with their harlots are around the bankers' shops each day as though on siege.
That score is the principal one;
inasmuch as I know for certain, that now- a-days there are more harlots ready for the money than there are weights for weighing it.
And I really don't know what purpose to say it is to serve that these procurers are thus keep­ ing them at the bankers' shops, except as in the place of ac­ count-books, where the sums lent on loan may be set down­ the sums received I mean, those expended let no one take count of.
In fine, in a great nation, amid numberless persons, the state being tranquil and in quiet, the enemy vanquished, it befits all to be in love who have anything to give.
Now, this Courtesan (pointing to the house) Phronesium, who dwells here, has totally expelled from my breast her own name.
Phrone­ sium, for Phronesis is wίsdom1.
For I confess that I was with her first and foremost;
a thing that's very disastrous to a lover's cash.
The same woman, after she had found another out, a greater spendthrift, who would give more, a .Babylonian Cap­ tain2, whom the hussy said was troublesome and odious to her, forthwith banished me from the spot.
He now is said to be about to arrive from abroad.
For that reason has she now cooked up this device;
she pretends that she has been brought to bed.
That she may push me out of doors, and with the Captain alone live the life of a jovial Greek, she pretends that this Captain is the father of the child;
for that reason does this most vile hussy need a palmed-off child.
She fancies that she's deceiving me!
Does she suppose that she could have concealed it from me, if she had been pregnant ?
Now I arrived at Athens the day before yester­ day from Lemnos, whither I have been on an embassy from this place on the public service.
But who's this woman?
It's her servant-maid Astaphium.
With her too as well I've had some acquaintanceship.
(Stands aside.)AST. (speaking to the SERVANTS within).
Listen at the door and guard the house, that no one who comes may go away more loaded than he came, or who has brought empty hands into our house may take them full out of it.
(To herself.)
I know the ways of people;
of such habits are the young men now-a-days.
For as soon as ever the jolly companions have arrived at the courtesans' houses, their plans are formed.
When they've arrived in-doors, some one of them is inces­ santly bestowing kisses on his mistress.
While they are en­ gaged, the others are pilfering1.
But if they see that any one is observing them, they play some trick, by which to amuse the observer with pleasantry and sport.
Full oft do they devour that belonging to us just as the sausage-makers2 do.
Upon my faith, this is the case, and some of the Spectators (to the AUDIENCE), i' faith, you know full well that I tell no lie in this.
There with them is the struggle and the valour, to carry oil a booty from the plunderers.
But we again nicely give a like return to these robbers of us;
for they them­ selves look on, while we are heaping up their property;
indeed, of their own accord even do they themselves bring it to us.
DIN. (apart).
In those words she's surely lashing myself;
for I've been heaping up presents there.
AST. (in answer to some one who calls from PHRONESIUM'S house).
I well recollect it.
I' troth, his own self, if he's at home, I'll at once bring here with me.
(Runs on.)DIN. (calling out).
Hallo!
Astaphium, do stop a moment, before you go away.
AST.
Who's calling me back ?
DIN.
You shall know;
look back this way.
AST.
Who is it ?
DIN.
One who wishes many a blessing to yourselves.
AST.
Give them then, if you wish us to have them.
DIN.
I'll let you have them.
Only do look back this way.
AST.
0 dear, you're teazing wretched me to death, who­ ever you are.
(Runs on.)DIN.
Worst of women, stop.
AST.
Best of men, go on;
you are troublesome.
(Turns round.)
Is that Dinarchus?
Why, it is he.
DIN.
He's going to your house;
and do you give me your hand (holding out his) in return, and walk together with me.
AST.
I am your servant, and am obedient to your command.
(Gives her hand.)DIN.
Yourself, how are you?
AST.
I'm well, and am holding by the hand one who's well.
Since you've arrived from abroad, a dinner must be givenl.
DIN.
You speak obligingly.
AST.
But, prithee, do let me go whither she ordered me.
( Withdrawing her hand.)DIN. (lets go her hand).
Be off then.
But how say you—?
AST.
What do you want ?
DIN.
He, that you are on your road to, who is it that you're going to fetch PAST.
Achiva, the midwife.
DIN.
You are an artful damsel.
AST.
I'm as usual then;
that's my practice.
DIN.
You deceitful hussy, I've caught you detected in a lie.
AST.
How so, pray?
DIN.
Because you said that you were going to bring his own self,” and not "herself."
A woman, then, has been made out of a man.
You are an artful one.
AST.
A conjurer!
DIN.
But, pray, tell me, Astaphium.
who is this person ?
A new lover ?
AST.
I think that you are a gentleman too much at his ease.
DIN.
Why now do you think so?
AST.
Because you trouble yourself about things that don't concern your own clothing and food.
DIN.
It's yourselves have made me a gentleman at ease.
AST.
Why so P .
DIN.
I'll explain it to you.
I've lost ray property;
with my property you've robbed me of occu­ pation.
If I had preserved my property, there had been something with which I might have been occupied.
AST.
And do you suppose that you can possibly well manage the affairs of state, or those of love, on any other terms without being a gentleman at ease ?
DIN.
It was she held a public employment, not I;
you misinterpret me.
But, against the law, in spite of my tax paid for pasturage1, she has received other cattle beside myself.
AST.
Most persons who manage their property badly, do the same as you are doing;
when they haven't wherewith to pay the tax, they blame the farmers of the taxes.
DIN.
My pasturage contract with you turns out but badly;
now in its turn, I wish to have, according to my nar­ ro' circumstances, a little bit of arable land here with you.
AST.
Here is no arable, but the field is pasture land.
If you desire some ploughing, you had better go to those9 who are in the habit of ploughing;
we hold this public emolument, the right of pasturage ;
those are farmers of other taxes.
DIN.
Full well enough do I know both sides.
AST.
I' troth, it's that way you are a gentleman at ease, since you've been going wrong both in that direction ana in this.
But the acquaintance of which do you like the best ?
DIN.
You are the more exacting, but they are perjured.
Whatever's given to them is.
lost outright, nor with them­ selves is there any show at all of it;
you, if you gain any­ thing, do at least drink and feast it away.
In short, they are unprincipled;
you are good-for-nothings, and full of airs.
AST.
All this abuse which, Dinarchus, you are uttering against us and them, you utter against yourself, both as re­ spects us and them.
DIN.
How's that ?
AST.
I'll tell the reason;
because he who accuses another of dishonesty, him it behoves to look into himself.
You who are so prudent, have got nothing from us;
we, who are good-for-nothings, have got all out of you.
DIN.
0 Astaphium!
you were not in the habit of speaking to me in that fashion formerly, but courteously, when I my­ self possessed that which is now in your possession.
AST.
While he's alive, you may know a person;
when he's dead, you may keep yourself quiet.
I used to know you when you were alive.
DIN.
Do you consider me to be dead PAST.
Prithee, how can it be plainer ?
He who formerly was esteemed a first-rate lover, for him to be bringing to his mistress nought but lamentations1.DIN.
I' faith, through your own faults it was done, who in former days were in haste to plunder me.
You ought to have done it leisurely, that, unscathed, I might last the longer for you.
AST.
A lover is like an enemy's fortress.
DIN.
On what ground ?
AST.
The sooner the lover can be taken by storm, the better it is for the mistress.
DIN.
I confess it;
but far different is the friend from the lover.
I' faith, for sure, the oldest friend's the best one pos­ sible for a man.
I' faith, my lands and tenements are not yet all gone.
AST.
Why then, prithee, are you standing before the door as a stranger and an alien ?
Do go in-doors.
Really you are no stranger;
for, upon my faith, not one person this day does she more love in her heart and soul—(aside) if, indeed, you've got land and tenements.
DIN.
Your tongues and talk are steeped in honey;
your doings and dispositions are steeped in gall and sour vinegar.
From your tongues you utter sweet words ;
you make your lovers of bitter heart if any don't give you presents.
AST.
I've not learnt to say what's false.
DIN.
It was not this liberality of mine that taught you to say what's false, but those niggardly fellows who are strug­ gling against their appetites.
You are a sly one, and the same artful coaxer that you used to be.
AST.
How ardently longed for have you returned from abroad!
But, prithee, do come, my mistress wants to see you.
DIN.
How so, pray ?
AST.
You alone of all mankind does she love.
DIN. (aside).
Well done, lands and tenements ;
you have come to my aid in good time.
(To ASTAPHIUM.)
But how say you, Astaphium—?
AST.
What do you want ?
DIN.
Is Phronesium in-doors just now ?
AST.
To you at all events she's in-doors.
DIN.
Is she well ?
AST.
Aye, faith, and I do believe she'll be still better when she sees you.
DIN.
This is our greatest fault:
when we're in love, then we are undone;
if that which we wish is told us, when mani­ festly they are telling lies, in our folly we believe it t> be true;
verily as though with a tide we fluctuate.
AST.
Heyday now-such is not the fact.
DIN.
Do you say that she loves me ?
AST.
Aye, you only, alone.
DIN.
I heard that she was brought to bed.
AST.
Oh, prithee Dinarchus, do hold your tongue.
DIN.
Why so?
AST.
I shudder in my alarm, as often as mention is made of childbirth, with such difficulty has Phronesium survived for you.
Prithee, do come in-doors now ;
do go to see her and wait there a little.
She'll be out just now;
for she was at the bath.
DIN.
What do you say ?
She who was never pregnant, how could she be brought to bed?
For really, I never, that I am aware of, perceived her to be in a breeding state.
AST.
She concealed it from you and was afraid, lest you should persuade her to have recourse to abortion1, and -go destroy the child.
DIN.
Troth then, who's the father of this child ?
AST.
A Babylonian Captain, whose arrival she is now ex­ pecting.
So much so, indeed, that, according as was reported, they say that he'll be here just now.
I wonder he has not arrived by this.
DIN.
Shall 1 go in, then ?
AST.
Why not ?
As boldly as at home, into your own house ;
for even still are you now one of us, Dinarchus.
DIN.
How soon are you on your return ?
AST.
I'll be there this instant;
it's close at hand where I was going.
DIN.
But do return directly;
meanwhile I'll wait for you at your house.
(He goes into the house of PHRONESIUM.)AST. (laughing).
Ha, ha, ha!
I'm at rest, since my plague has gone in-doors ;
now, indeed, I shall speak according to my own inclination, freely, as I please.
My mistress has sung a funeral dirge2 at our house for this fellow, her lover, over his estate;
for his lands and tenements are mortgaged for his treats in his amour.
But with him does my mistress speak freely upon the objects of her plans, and so he is rather a friend by way of counsel to her than by way of maintenance.
While he had it, he gave;
now he has got nothing;
what he did have, we have got;
what we had, he has now got the same.
The common course of things has happened.
For. tunes are wont to change upon the instant.
Life is checquered-
We remember him as rich, and he us as poor;
our remi­ niscences have shifted places.
He must be a fool to wonder at it.
If he is in want, it's necessary that he should allow us to make a living;
that's proper to be done.
'Twere a dis­ grace for us to have compassion on men that squander away their fortunes.
A clever Procuress ought to have good teeth ;
to smile upon whoever comes, to address him in flattering terms;
to design mischief in her heart, but to speak fairly with her tongue.
A Courtesan it befits to be like a briar;
whatever man she touches, for either mischief or loss cer­ tainly to be the result.
A Courtesan ought never to listen to the plea of a lover, but, when he has nothing to give, do you pack him off home from service as a deserterl;
and never is any gallant good for anything unless he's one who is the enemy of his own fortune.
It's trifling, if, when he has just given, he doesn't take a pleasure in giving afresh.
That person's esteemed with us who forgets that that has been given which he has given.
As long as he has anything, so long let him go on loving;
when he has got nothing, then let him look out another employment;
if he himself has got nothing, let him, with a contented mind, make way for others who have.
He's a proper lover who, neglecting his affairs, squanders away his property.
But among themselves the men declare that we act ill, and are greedy.
Prithee, do we in fact at all act ill ?
For, by my troth, never did any lover whatever give enough to his mistress ;
nor, i' faith, have we ever received enough, nor has any woman ever asked for enough.
For when a gallant is barren with his gifts * * * * *
If he denies that he has anything to give, alone * *** *
Nor do we receive enough, when a person has not enough to give us.
It is ever our duty to look after fresh givers, who take from untouched treasures, and make presents to us.
Just like this young man from the country, who dwells here (pointing to the house where STRABAX lives), i'.
faith, a very pleasant creature, and a very bounteous giver.
But he, without the knowledge of his father, even this very last night, leapt over the wall by way of the garden, and came to Our house.
I wish to meet with him.
But one servant has he, a very great savage, who, when he sees any one of us near the door, if you approach that way, drives us off just as he scares the geese away with his noise from the corn;
he's such a bumpkin.
But come what may, I'll knock at the door.
(Knocks at the door, and calls.)
Who, I wonder, has the keeping of this door ?
Is anybody coming out from in-doors ?
STRAT.
Who's this1, that's so sturdily plying his battering­ ram against our door ?
AST.
It's I. Look round at me.
STRAT.
Who's I ?AST.
Am I not seen by you ?
STRAT.
(turning to her).
Woe worth thee!
What mean you by this coming so near this door, or why's this knocking ?
AST.
Health to you.
STRAT.
Enow of thy health have I;
I care nought for't, I've got no health;
I'd rather be sick, than be a bit the sounder with health from thee.
This I want to know, what's owing thee here in our house ?
AST.
Do keep closeSTRAT.
Yea, faith, to my own good woman I trust;
let him keep close to thee whose habit 'tis.
A rare fine joke !
a silly hussy to be tempting a countryman to naughty tricks.
AST.
Keep close your anger, I meant.
STRAT.
As thee'st begun with me, so I'd e'en lay a wager2 there's not another like thee.
AST. (half to herself).
Really this fellow's very churlish.
STRAT.
Woman, dost thee go on abusing me ?
AST.
Why, what did I say to you ?
STRAT.
Why, because thee dost call me churlish.
There­ fore now, if thee doesn't be off this instant, and tell me quickly what thee want'st, adzookers, woman, I'll be, here this very instant, trampling thee beneath my feet like a sow her piglings.
AST.
This is indeed right country, and no mistake;
'tis an abominable and truly a monkey race.
STRAT.
(holding up his fist).
Dost thee throw the country in my teeth, when thee hast found a man who's ashamed of what's foul ?
Hast thee come hither to tempt me with thy decked out bones1 ?
Was it for that, shameless slut, thee dyed thy mantle of its smoke-dried colour, or art thee so fine because that thee's been a stealing ?
Come thee towards me then.
AST.
Now you charm me.
STRAT.
HOW much I wish I could charm thee.
AST.
You tell a lie.
STRAT.
Tell meAST.
What ?
STRAT.
What I ask thee.
Dost thee wish to be taken for a bondswoman, who dost carry on thee those rings ?
(Pointing to her fingers.)AST.
They give them to those who are worthy.
STRAT.
These are the spoils of Laverna2 which thee dost possess.
(Lays hold of her.)AST.
Don't be touching me.
(Moving away.)STRAT.
I, touch thee ?
So help me my weeding-hoe, I'd rather i' the country for me to be harnessed like an ox with crumpled horns, and with it spend the livelong night upon the straw, than that a hundred nights with thee, with a din ner apiece, were given me for nothing!
But what busi­ ness, woman, hast thee at our house ?
Why dost thee come running this way as often as we come to town ?
AST.
I want to meet with your women.
STRAT.
What women art thee talking to me about, when there's not even a single woman-fly within the house ?
AST.
What, does no woman live here ?
STRAT.
They've gone into the country, I say.
Be off.
AST.
Why are you bawling out, you lunatic ?
STRAT.
If thee doesn't make haste to get away from this with prodigious speed, I'll forthwith be separating even from thy brains those falsified, daintily arranged, corkscrew curls of thine, with all their grease as well.
AST.
For what reason, pray P STRAT.
Why, because thee hast even presumed to approach our door anointed up with thine unguents, and because thee hast those cheeks so nicely painted pink.
AST.
I' troth, it was by reason of your clamour that I coloured in my alarm.
STRAT.
And is it so ?
Thee coloured ?
As though, hussy, thee really hadst left to thy skin the power of re­ ceiving any colour.
Redden up thy cheeks, thee hast given all thy skin its colour with chalky
Ye are scoundrelly jades.
What's the reason, abominable hussies, that this way * * * * * ?
I know more than thee think'st I know.
AST.
Prithee, what's this that you know ?
STRAT.
How Strabax, my master's son, is ruining himself at your house;
how you are all enticing him to fraud and present-making.
AST.
If you appeared in your senses, I'd tell you.
You're uttering abuse only ;
not a person is in the habit of being ruined here at our house;
they waste their property ;
when they've wasted their property, they may go bare thence, if they choose.
I don't know this young man of yours.
STRAT.
Indeed so.
AST.
In sober truth.
STRAT.
Aye, but that garden wall2 that's in our garden says so, which is becoming every night less by a brick, over which he travels to your house on the road to destruction.
AST.
The wall's an old one;
it isn't wonderful if the bricks, being old, do tumble down.
STRAT.
And says thee, hussy, that old bricks do tumble down ?
By my fakes, may never any mortal man henceforth trust me upon the twc grand points1, if I don't inform of these goings on of yours to my elder master.
AST.
Is he a savage as well ?
STRAT.
Why, he didn't get his money by enriching harlots, but by thriftiness, and living hard;
which now, however, is being carried off to you, abomi­ cable jades.
(Takes her by the shoulders and shakes her.)
There's for thee, six-clawed hussy;
a wretched life to both oj ye.
Am I to keep mum about these matters P
But, lookye now, I'll be off to the Forum at once and tell these going on to the old gentleman, that he mayn't somehow be cherish­ ing within this matting2 a whole swarm of misfortunes.
(Exit.AST. (to kerself).
Upon my faith, if this fellow were living on mustard, I don't think he could possibly be as snappish.
But, i' troth, how much a well-wisher to his master he is.
Still, although he is a savage, I trust that he can be changed by coaxing, allurements, and other arts of the courtesan.
I've seen a horse from unruly become tamed, and other brutes as well.
Now I'll go back to see my mistress.
But see, my plague's coming out.
(The door of PHRONESIUM'S house is opened.)
He's coming out with a sad air;
he hasn't even yet had a meeting with Phronesium.
DIN.
I do believe that the fishes, that are always bathing as ong as they live, do not take so long in bathing as this Phro­ nesium does in bathing.
If women could be loved on as long as3 they take in bathing, all lovers would be becoming bath­ keepers.
AST.
Can't you endure waiting for a short time even PDIN.
Why, 'pon my faith, I'm wretchedly tired with wait­ ing already.
AST.
I, as well, shall be obliged to go bathe from wearinessDIN.
But, i' faith, Astaphium, prithee do go in-doors and teil her that I'm here.
Do go at once, and persuade her that she has bathed long enough by this.
AST.
Very well.
(Going.)
DIN.
And do you hear as well ?
AST.
What do you want?
(Comes back.)
DIN.
May the Gods confound me for calling you back.
I had nothing to say to you, only do be off.
AST.
Why did you call me back then, you worthless and good-for-nothing fellow ?
A delay to me which has produced fully a mile's delay to- you.
(Goes into the house of PHRONE­ SIUM.)DIN. (to himself.)
But yet why was she standing here so long before the house ?
Some one, I don't know who, she certainly was waiting for;
the Captain, I suppose.
That's it;
see now, how, just like vultures1, a whole three days beforehand they foresee on what day they are to have a feast.
They're all agape for him;
on him are all their minds fixed.
No one will be giving any more attention to myself, when he comes, than if I had been dead two hundred years ago.
How delightful a thing it is to keep one's money!
Ah wretched me!
after it's done I'm punished, who lost what I once had.
But now, if any great and splendid fortune should chance to fall to my lot, now, after I know it, what sweets and what bitters come of money, by my troth, I'd so keep it, I'd live in a manner so sparing, that—in a few days I'd make there to be none at all.
I'd then confute those who now censure me.
But I perceive that this tide-like door is opening (the door of PHRONESIUM'S house is opened), which sucks up whatever comes within its bolts.
PHRON.
Please now, is my door apt to bite2, that you are afraid to come in, my love ?DIN. (aside).
Behold the spring!
How all blooming it is!
how fragrantly does it smell!
how brightly does it shine.
PHRON.
Why so ill-mannered, as not, on your arrival from Lemnos1, to give a kiss to your mistress, my Dinarchus ?DIN. (aside).
0 dear, by my troth, I'm being punished now, and most terribly-PHRON.
Greetings to you as well.
Will you dine here to-day, as you've arrived in safety ?
DIN.
I'm engaged.
PHRON.
Where will you dine then ?
DIN.
Wherever you request me;
here.
PHRON.
You'll give me pleasure by doing so.
(They take their places at a collation spread before the house.)DIN.
I' troth, myself still more.
You'll give me your com­ pany to-day, I suppose, my Phronesium ?
PHRON.
If it could possibly be done, I would.
DIN.
Give me my shoes2 then-make haste, remove the table.
PHRON.
Are you in your senses, pray ?
DIN.
By heavens, I cannot drink now;
so sick at heart am I.
PHRON.
Stay;
something shall be done.
Don't go.
DIN.
Ah, you've refreshed me with cold water!
My senses have now returned.
Take off my shoes3;
give me something to drink.
PHRON.
By my faith, you are just the same that you used to be.
But tell me, have you sped successfully ?
DIN.
I' troth, successfully enough, indeed, hither to you, inasmuch as I enjoy the opportunity of seeing you.
PHRON.
Embrace me then.
DIN.
With pleasure.
(He embraces her.)
Oh, this is honey sweeter than sweet honey
In this, Jove, my fortune does exceed thine own !,PHRON.
Won't you give me a kiss ?
DIN.
Aye, ten even.
(Kisses her.)PHRON.
You are not niggardly in that.
You promise more than I ask of you.
(Tarns away her head.)DIN.
I only wish that from the first I had been as sparing of my property, as you are now thrifty of your kisses.
PHRON.
If I could possibly cause you any saving, i' troth, I could wish it done.
DIN.
Have you bathed then?
PHRON.
I'troth, indeed I have then, to my own satisfaction and that of my eyes.
Do I seem to be loathsome to you ?
DIN.
I' faith, not to myself indeed;
but I remember that there was once a time when between ourselves we were loath­ some1, the one to the other.
But what doing of yours is this I've heard upon my arrival ?
What new matter have you been scheming here in my absence ?'
PHRON.
Why, what is it ?
DIN.
In the first place, that you've been blessed with children, and that you've safely got over it, I'm delighted.
PHRON. (to some ATTENDANTS near the door).
Go you away from there into the house, and shut the door.
( They go in, and shut the door.)
You now alone are left to be pre­ sent at my communication;
to you I've ever entrusted my designs.
For my own part, I've neither had any child nor have I been pregnant;
but I've pretended that I was preg­ nant ;
I wasn't though.
DIN.
For what reason, 0 my life ?
PHRON.
On account of a Babylonian Captain, who kept me as though his wife for a year, while he was here.
DIN.
That I knew.
But what means this ?
For what purpose was your design in pretending this ?
PHRON.
That there might be a certain bond and tie- for him to be returning to me again.
Now he has lately sent me a letter hither, that he'll make trial how much I value him.
If I should raise and bring up the child which I should bear, that then I should have all his property.
DIN.
I listen with pleasure.
In fine, what is it you are contriving ?
PHRON.
My mother ordered the servant-maids, since now the tenth month is arriving close at hand, each to go in some different direction, to seek out and bespeak a boy or a girl, to be passed off as my own.
Why need I make many words ?
You know Syra, the female hair-dresser1, who now lives hard by our house ?
DIN.
I, know her.
PHRON.
She, with the utmost care, went about among the families, and secretly found out a child, and brought it to me.
She said it was given to her.
DIN. 0 shocking traffic!
She then hasn't borne this child who at first did bear it, but you who come afterwards.
PHRON.
You have the whole matter in its order.
Now, as the Captain has sent a message before to me, he'll be here no long time hence.
DIN.
Now, in the mean time, you are treating yourself here as though one who had just lain in ?
PHRON.
Why not, when, without trouble, the matter can be nicely managed ?
It's proper that every one should be alive at his own trade.
DIN.
What's to become of me when the Captain comes ?
Forsaken, can I live without you ?
PHRON.
When I've got from him that which I want, I shall easily find a way how to create discord and a separation between us ;
after that, my delight, I shall be always at your side.
DIN.
Aye, faith, but I'd rather it were at my couch2.
PHILON.
Moreover, I wish to sacrifice to-day to the Deities for the child, on this the fifth dayS, as is proper to be done.
DIN.
I think you ought.
PHRON.
Can't you venture to give me some trifling present ?
DIN.
Upon my faith, my delight, I seem to be making a gain for myself when you ask anything of me.
PHRON. (aside).
And I, when I've got it.
DIN.
I'll take care it shall be here just now.
I'll send mv servant hither.
PHRON.
Do so.
DIN.
But whatever it shall be, do take it in good part.
PHRON.
I' troth, I'm sure that you'll give all attention to your present, of which I shan't be ashamed so long as you send it to me.
DIN.
Do you wish anything else of me ?
PHRON.
That, when you have leisure, you'll come again to see me.
PHRON.
Farewell.
(Goes into her house.)DIN. (to himself).
0 immortal Gods!
'twere the part not of a woman in love, but of a partner of kindred feelings and confiding, to do what she just now has done for me, in dis­ closing to me the palming of the child upon the Captain,—a thing that a sister entrusts not to her own born sister.
She discloses herself now to me from her very soul, that sha will never prove faithless to me so long as she exists.
Ought I not to love her?
Ought I not to wish her well?
I'll rather not love myself, than that love should be wanting for her.
Shall I not send her a present ?
This instant, then, I'll order five minæ to be brought to her from my house, besides catering to the amount of a mina at least.
Much rather shall kindness be shown to her who wishes kindly to me, than to myself, who do every mischief to myself.
(Exit.PHRON. (speaking at the door to the SERVANTS within).
Give the breast to that child.
( To herself, coming forward.)
How wretchedly and anxiously are mothers1 distressed in mind.
I' faith, 'twas craftily contrived ;
and when I revolve this matter in my mind, we are accounted to be much less artful than we naturally are in disposition.
I'm now speak­ ing of what, but lately, for the first time, I've been taught at home;
how great is my anxiety of mind, what pangs I do feel in my heart, lest through the death of the child the plot should fail.
Because I'm styled its mother, for that reason am I the more anxious for its life, who have ven­ tured thus secretly to attempt a stratagem so great.
In my avarice, for the sake of gain, have I entered on this dis­ graceful scheme;
the pangs of others have I falsely shammed t'or myself.
You must attempt nothing by craftiness, un­ less you would carry it out with cunning and with care.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
You yourselves now see in what garb1 I go;
I'm now pretending that I'm an invalid from having lain in.
A thing that a woman attempts to do in fraud, unless she is perfect in carrying it out, that same is as bad as disease to her, that same is as bad as old age to her, that to her, wretched creature, is wretchedness:
if she begins to do what's right, soon does weariness of it overtake her.
How very few are tired who have commenced to do what's wrong;
how very few carry it out, if they have commenced to do anything, aright.
To a female it is a much less burden to do bad than good.
In that I'm an artful one, through the agency of my mother2 and my own artful dis­ position am I artful, who have thus feigned to the Babylonian Captain that I am pregnant.
I wish now the Captain may find this artful plot concocted well.
He'll be here no long time hence, I suppose;
forewarned of that I'm now forearmed, and I'm wearing this garb, as though I had just lain in in pregnancy.
(Calls to the SERVANTS within.)
Bring me hither some myrrh and fire for the altar, that I may pay adoration to my Lucina.
(They bring it.)
Place it here (pointing to an altar near the door), and go out of my sight.
Ho there!
Pithecium, help me to lay me down.
Come hither;
thus is it proper to help one who has just lain in.
(A. couch is brought in by ASTAPHIUM and two HANDMAIDS, and site lays herself down.)
Take off my sandals;
throw a coverlet here over me, Archylis.
Astaphium, where are you ?
Bring me hither, holy herbs, frankincense, and sweet­ meats.
Bring water for my hands.
( The SERVANTS go and fetch the things as ordered.)
Now, i' faith, I could wish that the Captain should come.
(The SERVANTS stand aside.)STRAT. (to the AUDIENCE).
Don't you be expecting.
Spec­ tators, that I should recount my combats;
with my hands in battle I'm wont to recount them, and not in words.
I know that many a soldier have told lies ;
both the Homeric poetlings1,and a thousand others besides them could be named, who have been both convicted and condemned for their sham battles.
He's not to be commended who trusts another any further than he sees.
It pleases me not when those com­ mend more who hear than those who see;
of more value is one eye-witness than ten hearsays.
Those who hear, speak of what they've heard;
those who see, know beyond mistake.
I like him not whom the town-gossips2 are praising, and the men of his maniple are mum about;
nor yet those whose tongues at home make blunt the edgeS of our swords.
The valiant are much more serviceable to the public than the eloquent and skilled.
Valour easily finds for itself a fluent eloquence;
without valour, for my own part, I esteem an elo­ quent citizen as a hired mourner4, who praises other people, but can't do the same for herself.
Now, after ten months, am I come to Athens of Attica to see my mistress, how she gets on, whom I left pregnant by my embrace.
PHRON. (raising herself on the couch, and speaking to As­ TAPHIUM).
See who's talking.
AST. (coming forward, and looking about).
The Captain's now close at hand, my mistress Phronesium:
Stratophanes is coming to you.
(In a low voice.)
Now is it requisite for you to pretend yourself an invalid.
PHRON. (in a low voice).
Hold your tongue.
What, the plague, dc I want you for as an adviser in this matter ?
Is it possible to excel myself in craftiness ?
STRAT. (to himself).
Madam's brought to bed, as I fancy.
AST. (in a low voice).
Would you like me to accost the gentleman ?
PHRON.
I wish you.
(ASTAPHIUM moves forward.)
STRAT.
0 delightful!
Why, see, here's Astaphium coming to meet me.
AST. (affecting surprise).
By all the powers!
welcome to you, Stratophanes, that you're safe arrivedSTRAT.
I know it all.
But, prithee, has Phronesium been brought to bed ?
AST.
She has been delivered of a very fine boy.
STRAT.
Is it like me at all ?
AST.
Do you ask the question?
Why, the moment it was born, it asked for a sabre and shield for itself.
STRAT.
It's my own;
I know it at once from the proofs.
AST.
Indeed it is extremely like you.
STRAT.
Ye Gods above!
Is it of full growth already ?
Has it already chosen some army which it intends to plunder PAST.
Why really, it was only born five days ago.
STRAT.
What then, after it was born ?
After so many days, i' faith, something really ought by this time to have been done.
What business had it to leave the womb before it could go forth to battle ?
AST.
Follow me, and wish her joy, and congratulate her.
STRAT.
I follow.
(They move to the other side of the stage.)PHRON. (in a faint voice).
Prithee, where is she who has left me here and forsaken me ?
AST.
I'm here;
I'm bringing you Stratophanes, so much longed for by you.
PHRON.
Prithee, where is he ?
STRAT.
(going close to the couch).
Mars, on his arrival from abroad, salutes Neriene his spousel.
Since you've well got over it, and since you've been blest with offspring, I congra­ tulate you in that you have given birth to a great glory to me and to yourself.
PHRON.
Welcome to you, you who have almost deprived me of life and light;
and who have, for your own gratification, centred in my body the cause of great anguish, with the pangs of which I'm even now dreadfully afflicted.
STRAT .
Well, well;
not to your misfortune, my love, do these pains befall you.
You've brought forth a son who'll be filling your house with plunder.
PHRON.
By the powers, there's very much greater need to have our granaries well filled with wheat;
lest, before he takes the plunder, hunger should be putting an end to us here.
PHRON.
Do, please, take a kiss from me here.
I cannot lift up my head;
such pain I've felt, and in such pain I now am;
and I cannot as yet, of my own strength, walk upon my feet.
STRAT. (stooping down, and kissing her).
If, right from the middle of the sea, you were to order me to take a kiss from you, I would not hesitate to fetch it, my sweet.
Y ou'vo experienced it already so to be;
and now shall you experi.
ence it, my Phronesium, that I do dote upon you.
(Pointing to a distance behind him.)
See there, I've brought you two female slaves from Syria;
I present you with them.
(To a SERVANT behind him.)
Do you bring those women this way.
Now, these were both of them queens at their own homes;
but with my own band I laid waste their country, I present you with them.
(Handing themforward to her.)PHRON.
Are you dissatisfied with the number of female slaves I have already, that you must be still making ad­ ditions to the number, to be devouring food for me ?
STRAT.
I' troth, if this indeed isn't acceptable to you, you boy (beckoning to the SERVANT), do you give me that bag.
See here, my love, I've brought this mantle from Panchæa1 for you.
Take it for yourself.
(He presents it to her.)PHRON.
What, is so little as this to be given me in return for pain so great ?
STRAT. (aside).
I' faith, to my misfortune, I'm undone!
My son's already costing me his weight in gold.
(To PHRO­ NESIUM.)
Do you still set such little value on me ? !
've brought you a purple garment from Sarra2, and two pretty ones from Pontus.
(Takes the garments from the SERVANT, and presents them.)
Take this for yourself, my love.
( To the SERVANT.)
Take those Syrian women hence out of my sight.
(The SERVANT takes them into the house.)
Do you love me at all?
PHRON.
Not at all, i' faith;
nor do you deserve it.
STRAT. (aside).
What, is nothing enough for her ?
Really, to myself she hasn't even said one word.
I do believe that these presents would sell for more than twenty minæ, which I have given her.
Now she's desperately enraged with me;
I perceive and understand it;
but I'll address her still.
(Tc PHRONESIUM.)
What say you then ?
Do you wish me, my love, to go to dinner where I was invited, and after that to return hither to your house to sleep ?
Why are you silent P (Aside.)
I' troth, beyond a doubt, I'm undone.
But what fine affair is this ?
Who's this fellow that's leading such a long train ?
I'm resolved to watch whither they are taking it.
It's being brought to her, I do believe;
but I'll soon know more.
(He stands at a distance.)GETA.
Get on, get on this way together with you, mules laden with money only to be squandered, you emptyers out of the house, you carriers off of property by waggon-loads!
(To the AUDIENCE.)
And can't he who is in love do without being good for nought, and cleaning himself out by his disgraceful practices ?
But how I know this, don't any one be asking that of me;
we've a lover at home, who's engaged in disgraceful pursuits ;
who esteems property just as dung:
he's in dread of the public officersl;
most cleanly in his ways is he.
He wishes his house to be cleaned out;
whatever he has at home, it's swept completely “ dehors2."
Since he himself is sending his own self to ruin, for my part, i' faith, I'll help him by stealth, and not through my assistance, indeed, shall he be ruined e'en a bit the less speedily than he may.
For now from these provisions, from the one mina I've just now abstracted five didrachms;
I've deducted for myself the Herculean share3.
But this is just like as though a person should turn off a stream for himself from a river;
if it is not turned off into a channel, still all that water would go into the sea.
For this is going into the sea, and is being utterly wasted to no good purpose whatever.
When I see these things going on, I pilfer, I purloin, from plunder I plunder take.
1 take a harlot to be just like what the sea is;
what you give her she swallows down, and yet never overflows.
But this at least the sea does preserve;
what's in it is seen.
Give her as much as ever you please, it's never seen either by the giver or the acceptor.
For instance, this harlot by her blandish­ merits has reduced my poor master to poverty;
has robbed him of fortune, life, honor, and friends.
(Catching sight of her.)
Heyday !
why look, she's close by.
I do think sEe has heard me saying all this.
She's pale, as she has been delivered of a child.
I'll address her, as though I didn't know her.
(Addressing PHRONESIUM.)
I present you my respects.
PHRON.
Our Geta, what is it you're about P How are you ?
GETA.
I'm well, and I'm come to one who's not so well, and I'm bringing something with which she may get well.
My master, the apple of your eye, bade me bring these presents to you, which you see those persons carrying, and these five minæ of silver.
PiRRus.
I' faith, it's not thrown away, that I'm so very fond of him.
GETA.
He bade me beg that you would accept these in kind part.
PHRON.
I' troth, I do accept them kindly and thankfully.
(To CYAMUS, who comes out of the house.)
Go, Cyamus, and order them to be taken in-doors.
Do you hear at all this which has been ordered ?
(The SERVANTS take up the things.)GETA.
I don't want them to take away the vessels;
I'd tike to have them emptied.
PHRON.
An impudent fellow, i' faith, how busy he is.
GETA.
What ?
do you say that I'm impudent, you who yourself are a receptacle of villany ?
PHRON.
Tell me, I beg of you, where is Dinarchus ?
GETA.
At home.
PHRON.
Tell him, that, for these presents which he has sent me, I love him the most of all men, and that in return I hold him in the highest esteem of all, aDd entreat that he will come hither to me.
GETA.
This instant.
But who's that person, pray (looking towards STRATOPHANES), that's devouring himself1, scowling with malignant eyes ?
I' faith, the man's distressed in his mind, whoever he is.
PHRON.
I' troth, he's deserving of it.
GETA.
What's the matter?
PHRON.
Prithee, don't you know ?
He that's yonder used to live with me;
he, there, is the father of my child.
He ordered it to be brought up till about a before-daylight breakfast2.
I waited his coming, I listened to his injunctions ;
I attended to the child.
GETA.
The good-for-nothing fellow that I knew so well, prithee, is that he ?
PHRON.
That's he.
GETA.
He looks at me as he groans.
He heaved a sigh from the very bottom of his breast.
Observe that now;
he gnashes his teeth ;
he strikes his thigh.
Prithee, is he deranged3, that he's beating his own self?
STRAT. (coming forward).
Now will I at once summon up my ungovernable indignation and my wrath from my breast!
(To GETA.)
Say, whence are you ?
To whom do you belong ?
Why have you dared to speak rudely against me ?
GETA.
It's my pleasure.
STRAT.
Do you answer me in that way ?
GETA.
In this way (snaps hisfingers) ;
I don't care one straw for you.
STRAT. (to PHRONESIUM).
What say ycu ?
Why have you dared to say that you love another man ?
PHRON.
I chose to.
STRAT.
Say you so;
indeed ?
I'll first make trial of that.
Do you, for the sake of such a shabby present, vegetables, and comestibles, and vinegar- water, bestow your love upon an effeminate, frizzle-pated, dark-haunt frequenting, drum-drubbing debauchee1, a fellow not worth a nutshell ?
GETA.
What new thing's this ?
Do you dare, you rogue, to speak ill of my master, you spring-head of vice and per­ jury ?
STRAT.
Add a single word to that;
by the powers, I'll that instant here with this cut you up into mincemeat upon the spot.
(Shaking his sword at him.)GETA.
Only touch me;
I'll that instant be making a lamb of you on the spot, and I'll slice you asunder in the middle.
If you have the renown of a warrior with your troops, still I'm a Mars2 in the kitchen.
PIIRON. (to STRATOPHANES).
If you did the thing that's right, you'd not be abusing my visitors, whose gifts I hold as acceptable and pleasing, and your own which I have received of you as unacceptable.
STRAT.
Then, i' faith, I'm both deprived of my presents and undone as well !
GETA.
Clearly it is so.
PHRON.
Why then are you now here, with your annoyance, who confess that you are worsted in every point ?
STRAT. (aside).
I' faith, I'm this day undone, if I don't drive this fellow away from you.
(He approaches GETA.)GETA.
(holding up hisfist).
Only approach this way;
only step this way!
STRAT.
Scoundrelly fellow, threatening even ?
Whom this very, very, very instant I'll be chopping up into splinters.
What business have you coming here ?
What business have you to approach her?
(Pointing to PHRONESIUM.)
What business have you, I say, to be knowing my mistress ?
You shall die this instant if you make the slightest movement with your hand.
GETA.
Why shouldn't I move my hand?
STRAT.
Do as I commanded;
stop;
I'll this instant cut you up into mincemeat on the spot.
GETA. (aside).
I'm done for.
STRAT.
'Twere best to be off.
GETA.
It's a ticklish point;
you have a longer sword there than this is (pointing to a knife in his girdle) ;
but just let me go seek a spit, if indeed I must be having a battle with you.
I'll be off home.
Warrior, for me and you I'll choose an impartial judge.
(Aside.)
But why am I delaying to betake myself off hence, while with a safe inside I may ? (Exit.PHRON. (to her SERVANTS).
Give me my sandals1, and take me at once in-doors;
for my head aches shockingly from the air.
STRAT.
What's to become of me, to whom the two female slaves cause ache enough, with which I presented you ?
(PHRO­ NESIUM is led into the house.)
Are you off then ?
Well, thus one's used in return.
How can you possibly shut me out.
(The door is slammed to.)
Prithee, can anything be more clear than that I'm now shut out ?
I'm finely fooled.
Be it so.
With how little difficulty (placing his foot against the door) might I now be persuaded to break the ankles of this entire mansion!
Do the manners of covetous women change at all ?
Since she has brought forth a son, she has plucked her spirit up.
Now it's as though she said to me, " I neither ask you nor forbid you to come into the house."
But I won't—I shan't go—I'll make her to be saying in a very few days that I'm a cruel man.
(To his ATTENDANTS.)
Follow me this way.
A word's enough.
(-Exit.STRAB. (to himself).
One morning a short time since my father ordered me to go hence, to deal out the mastfor food for the oxen.
After I got there a person arrived at the farm- house (so it pleased the Gods), who was owing money to my father, who hadformerly purchased some Tarentine sheep of my father ;
he asked for my father;
I said he was in the city;
I enquired what he wanted with him.
The fellow takes a purse from off his neck, and gives me twenty minae;
with pleasure I receive them, and stow them in my purse;
these bad sheep1, the minæ, have I brought in my purse hither to the city.
By my troth, Mars has proved very angry with my father;
for his sheep are not very far away from the wolves2.
Now, with this one stroke shall I send adrift those finical town gallants, and be bundling them all out of doors.
My father, in the first place, I'm quite resolved to ruin, root and branch;
then next in turn, my mother.
Now to-day I'll carry this money to her whom I love more than my own mother.
(Goes towards the door of PHRONESIUM, and knocks.)
Hillo there-is any one here ?
There's not a woman.
Is any one going to open this door ?
AST.
Why so a stranger, pray, my dear Strabax ?
Why don't you come in at once ?
Ought you to have been doing so, you, indeed, who are so intimate ?
STRAB.
I'll go in then, that you mayn't think I'm loiter­ ing.
(Goes into the house.)AST.
You act obligingly.
STRAT. (to himself).
It seems marvellous to me, that Strabax, my master's son.
hasn't returned from the country, unless perchance he has slily slipt in here into this den of cor­ ruption of his.
AST. (aside).
Now, faith, he'll be roaring at me if he espies me.
STRAT.
I'm much less savage now, Astaphium, than I was before.:
I'm not churlish now;
don't thee fear.
(She runs to a distance.)
What wouldst thee be at ?
What ?A ST.
What, say you ?
Why, I'm waiting for your churlish­ ness.
STRAT.
Say, command me what thee dost please, and in what way thee dost please.
I've got all my manners anew:
my old ones I've parted with.
I can e'en fall in love, or take a mistress now.
A ST.
Upon my faith, you do tell me fine news.
But tell me, have youPSTRAT.
A mistressl, perhaps, thee means.
AST.
You've understood nicely what I meant to say.
STRAT.
Hark you, since I've been so many times, back­ wards and forwards to the city, I've become quite a chat­ terer ;
I'm now a right good stalker2.
AST.
Prithee, what's that ?
That's nonsense;
perhaps you intend to mean “ talking."
STRAT.
Just so;
it differs mighty little from stalking.
A ST.
Prithee, do follow me in-doors, my love.
STRAT.
(holding out some money to her).
Take this for thyself;
keep it as a ledgers for thee, that thee mayst give me thy company this night.
AST. (taking the money).
You are the death of me, with your "ledger."
What kind of beast am I to say that is ?
Why don't you say " pledgeSTRAT.
The “ r" I make a saving of;
just as the Præ­ nestmes4 have "conia," for “ciconia.”AST.
Prithee, do follow me.
STRAT.
I'll wait here a little for Strabax, till he comes from the farm.
AST.
Why, Strabax is at our house.
He has just come from the farm.
STRAT.
What, before he went to his own mother P Alas, the man's worth nought, i' faith.
AST.
What now, your old habit ?
STRAT.
Well, I'll say nought.
AST.
Prithee, do come in- doors.
Give me your hand.
(Takes his hand.)STRAT.
Well, take it.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
I'm being led off into a public-house, where I shall be but poorly enter­ tained for my money.
(They go into the house of PHRO­ NESIUM.)DIN. (to himself).
There's not a person born, nor will there be born, nor can there be found one, to whom I would now wish praises to be given, or on whom attentions bestowed, rather than on Venus.
Ye great Gods, how joyous I am, and how I'm transported with joyousness!
Such great tidings of joy has Cyamus brought to me this day;
that my presents have been esteemed and deemed acceptable by Phronesium.
While this now is a delight, then besides this in especial is rare honey-drink to me, that the Captain's presents are held as disagreable and not acceptable.
I'm all enraptured!
The ball's my own1;
if the Captain's sent adrift, the woman will be mine.
I'm saved, because I'm going to ruin;
if I didn't go to ruin, it's clear I should die.
Now I'll keep watch, what's going on there, who goes into the house, who comes out of doors;
from here at a distance will I observe what is to be my lot.
Because I've got nothing, my feelings remind me of one thing;
I'll do everything by begging.
AST. (speaking to her MISTRESS as sAe comes out).
I'll cle­ verly do my duty, mistress;
do you only take care that in-doors you do yours as well;
love that which you ought, your own interest;
clean that fellow thoroughly out.
Now, while it pleases the fellow, while he has got something, adapt the oppor­ tunity to that purpose.
Display all your charms to your lover that you may heighten his joys.
I meantime will stay here behind and watch at this door so long as he is thus transport­ ing his presents home to you;
nor, in the meantime, will I admit any one from there to you who may cause you annoyance.
Do you go on, just as you please.
Are you not diddling these fellows ?
DIN.
How now, Astaphium, tell me, who is this fellow that's on the road to ruin ?
AST.
Prithee, were you here ?
DIN.
What—am I troublesome ?
AST.
More now than you were;
for unless a person is of use to us, he is troublesome to us.
But, prithee, do lend me your attention, that I may say what I want.
DIN.
Why, what is it ?
Does it concern myself ?
AST.
Not a rap.
But what hauls he is making present of in-doors.
DIN.
How ?
Some new lover ?
AST.
A fresh one, and a brimming treasure she has hit upon.
DIN.
Who is he ?
AST.
I'll tell you, but you be mum.
Don't you know this Strabax ?
(Pointing to his FATHER'S house.)DIN.
Why shouldn't I ?AST.
He alone rules the roast here at our house.
He just now is a landed estate to us.
With right good spirit is he wantonly wasting away his property.
DIN.
He's on the road to ruin;
i' faith, I, too, have come to ruin.
AST.
You are a simpleton, to expect with words to make undone what is done.
DIN.
Even Thetis, too, in weeping, made lamentation for her son.
Can I not now be admitted in-doors to your house?
AST.
Why so rather than the Captain ?DIN.
Why, because I've given more.
AST.
But you were admitted more, when you were giving more;
let those who give, in return for that which they give, enjoy our services.
You've learnt your letters;
since you know them yourself, let others learn them.
DIN.
Let them learn, so long as it is allowed me to com my lesson, that I may not forget what I have paid for.
AST.
In the meantime, while you, who are a master, shall be conning your lesson, she, as well, is desirous to con hers.
DIN.
How so ?
AST.
In receiving money ever and anon.
DIN.
For my own part, this very day I gave five minæ of silver to be carried to her, besides one for provisions.
AST.
I know that the same was brought;
with it we are now enjoying ourselves upon your liberality.
DIN.
For these enemies of mine here to be devouring my property!
By heavens, I'd rather that I were dead than submit to that!
AST.
You are a simpleton.
DIN.
How'a that?
AST.
Because, I' troth, I'd rather that my enemies should envy me, than I my enemies;
for to envy because it goes well with another, and goes badly with yourself, is wretchedness.
Those who are envious, are in want;
they who are envied, possess property.
DIN.
May I not be a partaker of the provisions bought with the mina ?
AST.
If you wanted to be a partaker, you should have taken half home.
For here an account of the receipts is entered just as at Acheron;
we take in-doors;
when it's got by us, it can't be carried out of doors.
(Turning on her heel.)
Kindly farewell.
DIN.
(catching hold of her).
Do stay.
AST. (struggling).
Let me go!
Leave off!
DIN.
Do let me go in.
AST.
Yes, to your own house.
DIN.
Aye, but here into your house.
AST.
You cannot go.
DIN.
I can, very well.
Do let me try.
AST.
No, wait here;
it's sheer violence to try.
I'd say that you are here, if she wasn't engaged.
(Runs to the door.)DIN.
Ha!
Do stop!
AST.
It's of no use.
DIN.
Are you going to return or not ?
AST.
I'd return, but a voice is calling me that has more influence with me than you have.
DIN.
In one word I'll say it.
You'll receive me PAST.
You are telling a lie—be off.
One word, you said ;
but now three words have you uttered, and those untrue.
(Goes into the house, and shuts the door.)DIN. (to himself).
She's off, and she's gone hence in-doors.
That I should endure these things to be done to me.
By heavens, enticer, with my cries I'll be exposing you to ridicule in the street, you who, contrary to law, have received money from many a one.
Upon my faith, I'll forthwith cause you name to be before every magistrate1, and after that I'll sue you for fourfold2, you sorceress, you kidnapper of children.
By the powers, I'll now disclose all your disgraceful deeds.
Worthless creature that I am, who have lost everything I had!
I'm become desperate, and now I haven't the slightest bit of concern what shoes I wear3.
But why am I trying here ?
What, suppose she were to order me to be let in ?
I could swear in solemn form that I wouldn't do it if she wished.
It's nonsense.
If you thump a goad with your fists, your hands are hurt the most.
It's no good to be angry at a thing of nothing;
a creature that doesn't value you a straw.
(Starting.)
But what's this?
0 immortal Gods, I see old Callicles, him who was my connexion by marriage4, bringing two female slaves in bonds, the one the hair-dresser of this Phronesium, the other his own servant- maid.
I'm greatly alarmed!
inasmuch as one care has so recently taken possession of my heart, I'm afraid lest all my former misdeeds should be discovered.
(Stands aside.)CALL. (to his SERVANT).
Do I use ill language to you or do I wish you so very ill ?
According to my ideas, you have both pretty well experienced how mild and gentle a person I am.
I interrogated you both, as you were lashed and hanging up by the arms ;
I well remember it;
the way in which you quite confessed each point, I know.
Here now, I wish in the same way to learn;
do you confess without a punishment.
Although you are both of you of the ser­ pent nature, I tell you beforehand, you mustn't be having double tongues, lest with your two tongues I should be putting you to death;
unless, perhaps, you wish to be taken to the men who go clink, clink1.
MAID.
Violence forces me to confess the truth;
the thongs do so gall my arms.
CALL.
But, if you confess the truth to me, you shall be relieved from the chains.
DIN. (apart).
Even now, what's the matter, I'm at a loss to know and uncertain;
except that still I'm afraid.
SYRA.
What I've done wrong I know not.
CALL.
First of all, then, you stand apart.
(They stand apart.)
Aye, so;
that's what I mean ;
that you mayn't be making signs between you, I'll be a party-wall.
(To his MAID-SERVANT.)
Speak you.
MAID.
What am I to speak about ?
CALL.
What was done with the child that my daughter was delivered of?
My grandchild, I mean?
Tell me the circumstances of the case.
MAID.
I gave it to her.
(Pointing to SYRA.)CALL. (to the MAID-SERVANT).
Now hold your tongue.
(To SYRA.)
Did you receive the child from her ?
SYRA.
I did receive it.
CALL. (to SYRA).
Hold your tongue;
I want no more;
you've confessed enough.
SYRA.
I'm not going to deny it.
CALL.
By this you've now caused some relief for your shoulder-blades.
So far, the account of each of them tallies.
DIN. (apart).
Ah wretched me!
my doings are now being disclosed, which I hoped would be concealed.
CALL. (to the MAID-SERVANT).
Speak, you.
Who bade you give the child to her ?
MAID.
My elder mistress.
CALL. (to SYRA).
What say you ?
Why did you receive it ?
SYRA.
My young mistress entreated me that the child might be brought, and that all this might remain secret.
CALL. (to SYRA).
Speak, you.
What did you do with this child ?
SYRA.
I took it to my mistress.
CALL.
What did your mistress do with this child PSYRA.
Gave it at once to my mistress.
CALL.
Plague on it, to what mistress ?
MAID.
There are two of them.
CALL. (to the MAID).
Take you care, unless I ask you Anything, only to answer that which I ask of you.
SYRA.
The mother, I say, made a present of it to the daughter.
CALL.
You are saying more than you did just now.
SYRA.
You are asking more.
CALL.
Answer me quickly;
what did she do, to whom it was given ?
Tell me.
SYRA.
She passed it off asCALL.
Whose ?
SYRA.
As her own son.
CALL.
As her own son ?
Ye Gods, by my trust in you I do appeal to you, how much more easily does another than she to whom it belongs, bring forth another's child!
She, by the labours of another, has brought forth this child without pain.
A child blest indeed!
two mothers it has got, and grandams two1.
I'm now afraid how many fathers there may have been.
Do see, please, the shocking deeds of women!
MAID.
I' troth, this fraud relates rather to the men than to the women.
'Twas a man, and not a woman, that caused her pregnancy.
CALL.
I know that too.
You were a trusty guardian for it.
MAID.
He can do the most, who is strong the most.
Ho was a man;
he was the strongest;
he prevailed;
what he wanted, he carried off.
CALL.
And, i' faith, he too brought a heavy mishap, in fact, upon yourself.
MAID.
The thing itself experienced, I myself fully know that, even if you had held your tongue.
CALL.
Never, this day, have I been able to make you de­ clare who he was.
MAID (asside, on catching sight of DINARCHUS).
I've held my tongue;
but now I shan't hold my tongue, since he'a here;
it's necessary I should tell.
DIN. (apart).
I'm petrified;
in my wretchedness, I dare not move myself;
the matter's all out!
The trial's now going on here for my life!
These are my misdeeds, this is my folly.
I'm in dread how soon I may be named.
CALL. (to the MAID-SERVANT).
Speak out, who was it debauched my maiden daughter ?
MAID.
I see him near you.
CALL.
Hussy, who was it ?
MAID.
A supporter of the wall1.DIN. (apart).
I'm neither alive nor dead, nor know I what I am now to do;
neither know I how to go away hence, nor how to accost him;
I'm numbed with fear.
CALL.
Will you tell me, or no ?
MAID.
It is Dinarchus, to whom you first betrothed her.
CALL. (looking round).
Where is this person whom you mention ?DIN. (stepping forward).
Here I am, Callicles.
(Falling on the ground.)
By your knees I do entreat you that you wil.
bear with wisdom that which was done in folly;
and that you will pardon me that, which, losing my senses, I did through the bad influence of wine.
CALL.
You please me not.
You throw the blame on what is dumb2, that which cannot speak.
But the wine, if it could speak, would defend itself.
It's not wine that's in the habit of ruling men, but men wine;
those, indeed, who are virtuous men;
but he who is bad, although he drinks water, or if indeed he abstains from intoxicating liquors, still, by nature he's bad.
DIN.
Well, I'm sensible that many reproaches must be heard by me, which I would prefer not.
I confess that I've offended you, and am privy to the crime.
MAID.
Callicles, prithee beware that you do injury to no person;
the accused is pleading his cause at large, the wit­ nesses you are keeping in bonds.
CALL. (to his SLAVES).
Release those women.
(They are unbound.)
Come (to each of them in turn), do you be off home, and you home as well.
( To SYRA.)
Tell your mistress this.
she must give up the child, if any one asks for it.
(SYRA.
goes into the house of PHRRONESIUM, and exit the MAID-SERVANT.)
You, Dinarchus, let's go before the judge.
DIN.
Why do you wish me to go before the judge ?
You are the Prætor to me.
But I entreat of you, Callicles, that you'll give me your daughter for a wife.
CALL.
I' faith, I find, indeed, that you've come to a decision on that point yourself;
for you haven't waited till I gave her;
you have helped yourself.
Now keep her, as you've got her, but I'll fine you this grand haul;
six great talents will I deduct from her dowry for this folly.
DIN.
You act kindly towards me.
CALL.
'Twere best for you to demand your son back from thence.
(Pointing to the house of PHRONESIUM.)
But your wife, as soon as possible, take away from my house.
I shall at once.
therefore, send a messenger to that kinsman of mine by marriage, and tell him to look out for another match for his son.
(-Exit.DIN. (to himself).
But I'll demand back the child of her, lest by-and-by she should deny it.
That's of no use;
for she herself, of her own accord, has discovered the whole matter to me, how it happened.
But see, right opportunely, i' faith, is she coming out of doors from her house.
Assuredly, a far-darting sting has that woman, who even from that dis­ tance is wounding my heart.
(Stands aside.)PinON. (to herself).
A woman is a spoony and a trolloping slut, if she hasn't a view to her own interests, even in her cups.
If her other limbs are soaked in wine, at least let her head be sober.
But it's a vexation to me that my hair-dresser has been thus badly treated.
She has been telling me that this child has been discovered to be the son of Dinarchus.
When I heard that * * * * (She moves, as if going.)DIN. (apart).
She's going, in whose hands are all my for­ tune and my children.
PHRON. (seeing DINARCHUS).
I see him who has consti­ tuted me the guardian of his property.
DIN. (coming forward).
Madam, here am I.PRRON.
It certainly is he.
"What's the matter, my love ?
DIN.
No love;
cease your trifling.
I've nothing now to do with that subject.
PHRON.
By my faith, I know what you want, and what you desire, and what you ask for.
You want to see me;
you desire to caress me;
you ask for the child.
DIN. (aside).
Immortal Gods!
how plain she speaks.
How, in a few words, has she hit upon the very point!
PHRON.
As for me, I know that you are betrothed, and that you have a son by your betrothed, and that a wife is now going to be married by you ;
that now your thoughts are else­ where, that myself you are going to consider as forsaken.
But still consider, the little mouse, how sagacious an animal it is, which never entrusts its life to one hole only ;
inasmuch as, if one hole is blocked up, it seeks another as a place of refuge.
DIN.
When there's leisure, then I'll talk to you on those matters more at large;
at present, give me up the child.
PHRON.
No;
do, there's a dear, let it be at my house the few next days.
DIN.
Certainly not.
PHRON.
Do, there's a dear.
DIN.
What occasion is there ?
PHRON.
It's for my interest.
This for the next three days at least, until the Captain is circumvented somehow;
for that same purpose.
If I get anything, it shall be for your own advantage as well.
If you take the child away, all hope in the Captain will evaporate from my heart.
DIN.
I would have that done;
but, when it's taken home, to do it again1, if I were to wish it, I have not the opportunity.
Now make use of the child, and take care of it, because you have the means by which to take care of it.
PHaRoN.
Upon my faith, I do love you much for this matter.
When you shall be afraid of a scolding at home, do you take shelter here in my house.
At least, prove a friend, to help me to a profitable speculation.
DIN. (moving).
Kindly farewell, Phronesium.
PHRON.
Won't you any logger call me " apple of your eye?"
DIN.
That name too, meanwhile, shall be repeated full oft.
PHRON.
Do you wish for anything else ?
DIN.
Fare thee well;
when I have leisure, I'll come to your house.
(Exit.PHRON.
Well, he's gone away from here, and has taken his departure;
we may say here whatever we please.
'Tis a true proverb that's quoted, " Where the friends are, there are the riches."
Through him, there's still some hope that the Captain may be duped to-day;
whom, by the powers, I love better than my own self,-so long as I get out of him what I want:
since, when we have got much, not much of it is seen that has been given.
Such are the brilliant prospects of Courtesans!
AST.
Hush!
hush!
be quiet.
AST.
The father of the child is coming.
PHRON.
Well, let him come here.
Let him, if it only is he, let him come himself straight up to me here just as he chooses.
If he does come, for very sure, i' faith, I'll do him to-day with some cunning tricks.
(They go into the house.)STRAT. (to himself).
That I should love1 for this!
l'in taking an atonement for my offences to my mistress!
That that may be taken by her in kindly part which I've squandered before, I'll add this as well.
But what's this ?
I see the mistress and her maid before the house.
I must accost her.
(Addressing them.)
What are you doing here ?
PHRON.
Don't speak to me.
STRAT.
You are too angry.
(Pats her on the shoulder.)
PHRON.
Leave me alone.
Can't you possibly cease to be an annoyance to me ?
STRAT.
What is the matter, my dear little Astaphium?
AST.
I' faith, she's angry with you with good reason.
PHRON.
What, I ?
I'm not even half spiteful enough to.
wards that fellow.
STRAT.
My love, if I have at all offended before, I present you with this mina of gold.
If you smile upon me, deign me a look.
PHRON.
My hand forbids me to believe anything, before it holds in its possession.
We require food for the child;
we require it for the dame1, as well, that bathes the child;
we require it for the nurse2, as well, that she may have a leather bottle full of old wine in ample style, that night and day she may tipple;
we stand in need of fire;
we want coals, too;
we want swathes, napkins, the cradle, the cradle-bed;
oil we want;
the child requires flourforpap;
all day we are wanting something;
never, in the same one day, can our task be performed, but what there's always need of something;
for the children of officers cannot be reared upon medlars3.
STRAT.
Look upon me then.
Take this (presenting the, money), with which to satisfy these necessities.
PHRON. (taking it).
Give it me, although it's very little.
STRAT.
Whatever you shall order, shall be given at your demand.
Give me a kiss now.
(Tries to kiss her.)PHRON.
Leave me alone, I say!
You are a nuisance!
STRAT. (aside).
It's no use, I'm not loved by her.;
the day wears apace.
More than ten pounds of silver have I lost in this short time by reason of my passion.
PHRON. (giving the money to ASTAPHIUM).
Take this, and carry it away in-doors.
(ASTAPHIUM carries it in.)STRAB. (to himself).
Where in the world is ray mistress?, I get on with no business, either in the country or here, at this rate ;
I'm spoiling with mouldiness, I'm grown so dread­ fully numbed with lying waiting here upon the couch.
But look, I perceive her.
Hallo!
sweetheart, what are you about ?
STRAT.
What fellow is that ?
PHRON.
One that, upon my honor, I love far more than yourself.
STRAT.
Than myself?
In what way?
PHRON.
Why, this way, that you are not to be troublesome to me.
(Moves as if going.)STRAT.
Are you going now, after you've got the gold ?
PHRON.
What you've given me, I've put away in-doors.
STRAB.
Come here, sweetheart;
I've got something to say to you.
PHRON.
Why, I was just coming to you.
PHRON.
In serious truth, i' faith.
STRAB.
Although I seem a simpleton to you, I like myself to have a bit of recreation.
For pretty though you are, you are so to your own loss, unless I amuse myself a bit with you.
PHRON.
Should you like me to embrace you and give you a kiss ?
STRAB.
Do whatever you like, I'll deem it agreable.
(She kisses him.)STRAT.
What, shall I suffer her to be embracing other men before my eyes ?
I' faith, 'twere better that I were dead.
Woman, take your hands off of him, unless, perhaps, by this b.. ord of mine, won from the enemy, you wish yourself and him to die.
(Flourishing his sword.)
PHRON.
There's no use in " badinage1," Captain.
If you want yourself to be loved, with gold, Stratophanes, not with iron, may you prevent him from loving me.
STRAT.
How, the plague, are you pretty or witty, to be fond of a fellow of that description ?
PHRON. (aside, to STRATOPHANES).
Don't it come to your recollection what an actor once said upon the stage ? "
All people have an eye to their profit, and are not over delicate."
STRAT.
That you could possibly caress this fellow, so dirty and foul!
PaRON.
Although he is dirty, although he is foul, still, he's pretty to me.
STRAT.
Didn't I give you some gold ?
PaEON.
To me ?
You gave money for the child's food.
STRAB.
Now, if you hope to have her, another mina of gold is requisite.
STRAT.
A sore mishap upon these people, and a weighty one!
STRAB.
By all means, keep that by way of provision for your own journey.
STRAT.
What does she owe you ?
STRAB.
Three things.
STRAT.
What, pray P STRAB.
Perfumes, her favours, and kisses.
PHRON. (apart).
He answers him like for like.
(To STRATOPHANES.)
But now, at all events, if you do love me, do you give me some little trifle from your most abundant treasures.
STRAT.
Do say, there's a dear, what it is that I'm to give you;
only say.
If I have it left, you shall have it.
PHRON.
Mere kickshaws1 you're talking about.
Be off, be off.
(STBABAX kisses her.)STRAT.
I've considered this over with myself.
My good sir, take you care, will you, that she don't inflict a wound upon you, whose teeth are made of iron.
She's allowing access to her to all in common.
You take your hand off of her.
STRAB. (striking him).
Then, by my troth, do you take that, with a hearty punch, warlike man!
STRAT.
I've given her gold.
STRAB.
And I, silver.
STRAT.
And I a mantle and a purple garment.
STRAB.
And I, sheep and wool;
and many other things that she shall ask for I'll give.
'Twere better for you to con­ test it with me with minæ than with menaces2.
PHRON.
Upon my faith you are a funny mortal, my Strabax.
Prithee, do proceed—— (Aside.)
A fool and a madman are contending for their ruin;
I'm all right.
STRAT.
Come, younker, do you offer something first.
STRAB.
Why no;
do you squander first, and come to ruinSTRAT. (to PHRONESIUM).
Well, here's a talent of silver for you.
It's in Philippean coins.
Take it for yourself.
PHRON. (taking the money).
So much the better.
Be one of our family, but live at your own expense.
STRAT. (to STRABAX).
Where is that which you are going to give ?
Open your purse-strings3.
PHRON.
That's a challenge.
STRAT. (to STRABAX).
What are you afraid of?
STRAB.
You are from abroad1.
I live here (points to his FATHER'S house).
I am afraid.
STRAT.
I am not.
Walk off, then.
STRAB.
I'm bringing her some sheep fastened in a purse to my neck.
STRAT.
Because I gave that, how I did flounder the fellow2.
STRAB.
Why no, indeed, it's I, who am going to give.
PHRON. (to STRATOPHANES).
Come in-doors now, prithee, and (to STRABAX) do you then stay with me here.
STRAT.
You will give me your company then ?
STRAB.
What do you say ?
What, with this fellow ?
Am I to be postponed ?
STRAT.
I have made my present.
PHRON. (to STRATOPHANES).
You have given;
(pointing to STRABAX) he's going to give just now;
the one I've got, the other I expect.
But each of the two shall be indulged to his heart's content.
STRAB.
So be it.
As I see the matter stands, that must be taken that's offered.
STRAT.
Indeed, I shall assuredly not be letting you take possession of my couch.
PHRON. (aside).
I' faith, I've cleverly netted them, and quite to my satisfaction.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
And as I see my affairs successfully managed, yours likewise3 would I success­ fully manage.
I'll caress you in reality.
If lou are disposed to be doing anything, take care, will you, and let me know at once.
For the sake of Venus, applaud;
this Play is in her honor.

A YOUNG WOMAN, daughter of Saturio.
Scene.
—Athens :
before the houses of DORDALUS and of the Master of TOXILUSTOXILUS, who is left in charge of his master's house in his absence, is desirous of obtaining the liberty of his mistress Lemniselene, who belongs to the Procurer Dordalus.
He applies to his friend Sagaristio to lend him the sum necessary for that purpose.
Sagaristio has not the money himself, but succeeds in finding some for the use of his friend.
With the view of getting back the money when paid to Dordalus, Toxilus prevails on the Parasite Saturio to allow his daughter to be sold by Sagaristio to Dordalus, as though she were a slave.
While these arrangements are being made, Lemniselene sends her attendant Sophoclidisca with a letter to Toxilus, and he at the same time sends the boy Pægnium with a message to Lemniselene.
On receiving the money from Sagaristio, Toxilus pays it to Dordalus, who sets Lemniselene at liberty.
Immediately after this, Sagaristio, dressed as a Persian, brings the daughter of Saturio, also dressed as a Persian captive, and sells her to Dordalus, without warranty, for a large sum of money.
Immediately upon the departure of Sagaristio, Saturio makes his appearance, and claiming his daughter, takes her away Toxilns and Sagaristio conclude with a feast, and make merry over the Procurer's misfortunes.
His master being absent (Profecto), Toxilus purchases (Emit) his mistress, and contrives that the Procurer sets her at liberty;
and he then persuades him to buy of her capturer a young woman, a captive (Raptam), the daughter of his Parasite being dressed up (Subornatâ) for that purpose;
and (Atque) as he carouses, he makes sport of Dordalus, thus cajoled.
Tox. (to himself).
He who, falling in love, destitute of means, has first entered upon the paths of love, has in his own labours exceeded all the labours of Hercules.
For with the lion2, and with the Hydra, with the stag, with the Æto­ .ian boar, with the birds of Stamphalus, with Antæus, would I rather contend than with love.
So wretched am I become with hunting after money to borrow;
and yet, those whom I ask know of nothing to answer me, except " I have got none."SAG. (apart).
The servant that is desirous faithfully to serve his master, i' troth, it surely does behove him to trea­ sure up full many a thing in his breast which he may think will please his master, both present and abroad.
I neither serve with cheerfulness, nor am I quite to my master's satis­ faction ;
but, as though from a running eye, my master is still unable to keep his hands off me, in giving me his coin­ mands, in making me the support of his affairs.
Tox.
Who's this that's standing opposite to me ?
SAG.
Who's that that's standing opposite to me ?
Tox.
It's like Sagaristio.
SAG.
Surely this is my friend Toxilus.
Tox.
Certainly it is he.
SAG.
I think it is he.
Tox.. I'll go meet him.
SAG.
I'll go up and accost him.
Tox. (meeting him).
0 Sagaristio, may the Gods bless you.
SAG.
0 Sagaristio, the Gods grant you what you may de­ sire.
How fare you ?
Tox.
Just as I can.
SAG.
What's the matter ?
Tox.
I still live.
SAG.
Quite then to your satisfaction ?
Tox.
If the things come to pass which I desire, quite.
SAG.
You deal with your friends in a very silly fashion.
Tox.
How so ?
SAG.
Because you ought to give them your commands.
Tox.
As for myself, you were already dead to me, because I haven't seen you.
SAG.
Business, upon my faithTox.
In the iron chain line, perhaps.
SAG.
For more than a twelvemonth I've been promoted in chains to be commanding officer in the basting line1 at the mill.
Tox.
Why, that's your old line of service.
SAG.
Have you been quite well all along ?
Tox.
Not very.
SAG.
I' faith, it's with reason then you are so pale.
Tox.
I've been wounded in the battles of Venus;
Cupid has pierced my heart with his arrow.
SAG.
Do servants then fall in love here ?
Tox.
Why, what could I do ?
Was I to be struggling against the Gods ?
Was I, like the sons of Titan, to be waging war with the Deities, with whom I am not quite able to cope ?
SAG.
Do you only take care that "catapult" made of elm2 don't pierce your sides.
Tox.
In right royal manner I'm celebrating the feast of Freedoml.
SAG.
How so P Tox.
Because my master's gone abroad.
SAG.
Do you say so P Is he gone abroad ?
Tox.
If you can bear to be enjoying yourself, do you come:
you shall live with me;
you shall be treated with right royal entertainment.
SAG.
Out upon it (rubbing himself) ;
my shoulder-blades are quite itching now, because I've heard you mention these things.
Tox.
But this one thing is torturing me.
SAG.
Why, what is it ?
Tox.
This day is the very last day, to determine whether my mistress is to be free, or whether she is to endure lasting servitude.
SAG.
What, then, do you now desire P.Tox.
You have it in your power to make me your friend for ever.
SAG.
In what way ?
Tox.
In lending me six hundred didrachms, for me to pay the same for her freedom, which I will forthwith refund you in the next three or four days.
Come, do be good-natured;
give me your help.
SAG.
With what assurance, you impudent fellow, do you venture to ask so much money of me ?
Why, if I myself were to be sold all in one lot, it's hardly possible for as much to be received as you are asking me for;
for now you are asking for water from a pumice-stone, which is all a-dry itself.
Tox.
Ought you to be treating me in this fashion ?
Tox.
Do you ask the question?
Beg it on loan from somebody.
SAG.
You do the same as you are asking me.
Tox.
I've been trying;
I've found it nowhere.
SAG.
I really will try, if any one will trust me.
TOX.
Am I then to consider it1 as a thing in possibility ?
SAG.
If I had had it at home, I'd promise it at once.
This is in my power, to use my best endeavours.
Tox.
Whatever it is, come you home to me.
1SAG. Still do you try to get it;
I'll carefully do the same.
If anything shall turn up, I'll let you know at once.
Tox.
I entreat.
you, and entreat over and over again, do give me your stanch help in this.
SAG.
0 dear!
you are worrying me to death by your im­ portunity.
Tox.
It's through the fault of love, and not my own, that I'm now become a silly prater to you.
SAG.
Then, i' troth, I'll now be taking my leave of you.
(Moving.)Tox.
Are, you going away, then?
A good walk tc you.
But betake yourself back as soon as you can, and•do take care that I haven't to seek you;
I shall be close at home 'until I have cooked up a mishap for the Procurer.
(-EXit SAGARISTIO, and TOXILUS goes into the house.
SAT. (to himself).
The old and ancient calling of my fore­ fathers do I follow, and hold, and cultivate with great care.
For never was there any one of my forefathers, but that by acting the parasite they filled their bellies:
my father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, his father, and his grandfather, just like mice, always fed on the victuals of others, and in love of good eating no one could excel them.
Hard Heads2 was their surname.
From them have I derived this calling, and the station of my forefathers;
nor do I wish myself to turn informers, nor indeed does it become me, without risk of my own, to go seize upon the goods of other people ;
nor do those persons please who do so;
I'm speaking out.
For whoever does this, more for the sake of the public than of his own benefit, my mind can be induced to believe that he is a citizen both faithful and de­ serving ;
but if he should not prosecute to conviction the breaker of the laws, let him pay one half of the intended penalty to the public.
And let this, too, be written in that law;
when an informer has prosecuted any one, let the other in his turni sue him for just as much, and upon equal terms let them come before the Triumvirs2.
If that were done, assuredly I'd make those nowhere to be seen, who here with their whitened nets3 lay siege to the property of others.
But am I not a simpleton, to be taking care of the public interests when there arc the magistrates, whose duty it is to take care of them ?
Now I'll in-doors here;
I'll go look after the scraps from yesterday, whether they have rested well or not;
whether they have had a fever4;
whether they've been well covered up or not, so that no one could creep up to them.
But the door is opening;
I must pause in my steps.
Tox. (to himself).
I've hit upon the whole matter, so that with his own money the Procurer may this day make her his freed-woman.
But see, here's the Parasite whose assistance I have need of.
I'll make believe as though I didn't see him;
in that way I'll allure the fellow.
(Goes to the door, and calls to the SERVANTS within.)
Do you attend, you there, and quickly make haste, that I mayn't have any delay when I come in-doors.
Mix the honied wine;
get ready the quinces and the junkets1, that they may be nicely warmed upon the dishes, and throw in some scented cala­ mus2.
I' faith, that boon-companion of mine, I fancy, will be here just now.
SAT. (apart).
He's meaning me—bravo!
Tox.
1 think that he'll be here just now from the baths when he has bathed.
SAT. (apart).
How he does keep everything in its due order.
Tox.
Take you care that the gravy-cakes3 and the cheese- biscuits4 are hot;
don't be giving them to me unbaked.
SAT. (apart).
He'a speaking the very fact;
they are worth nothing raw, only if you swallow them warm.
Then, unless the broth for the gravy-cakes is of a thick consistency, that miserable, thin, pale, transparent stuff, is worth nothing at all.
The broth for a gravy-cake ought to be like a soup.
I don't want it to be going into my bladder, I want it for my stomach.
Tox. (pretending not to see him).
Some one, I know not who, is talking near me here.
SAT. (accosting him).
0 my earthly Jupiter, your fellow­ feaster addresses you.
Tox. 0 Saturio, you've come opportunely for me.
SAT.
Upon my faith, you are telling a lie, and it becomes you not;
for as Hungeriol I'm come, not as Saturio am I come.
Tox.
But you shall have something to eat;
for now the creature-comforts for the stomach are smoking away in-doors.
I've ordered the remnants to be warmed.
SAT.
Why, it's the proper thing for the gammon to be served up cold the day after.
Tox.
I've ordered it so to be done.
SAT.
Any caviare2 ?
Tox.
Get out-do you ask the question ?
SAT.
You have a capital notion of what's good3.
Tox.
But do you at all remember the matter about which I was making mention to you yesterday ?
SAT.
I recollect;
that the lamprey and the conger ought not to be made warm;
for they are much better stripped of their meat4 when cold.
But why do we delay to com­ mence the engagement ?
While it's the morning, it befits all people to eat.
Tox.
It's almost too early in the morning.
SAT.
The business that you begin to do in the morning, that same lasts on throughout the day.
Tox.
Prithee, do give your attention to this.
For yester­ day I mentioned it to you, and entreated you to lend me six hundred didrachms.
SAT.
I recollect it and am aware, both that you did ask me, and that I hadn't any to lend.
A Parasite's good for nothing that has got money at home;
he has a longing at once to begin upon an entertainment, and to gobble away at his own expense, if he has anything at home.
A Parasite ought to be a right down needy Cynic;
he ought to have a leather bottle1, a strigil, an utensil2, a pair of slippers, a cloak, and a purse;
and in that a little of the needful, with which he may just cheer up the existence of his own household.
Tox.
I don't want money now;
lend me your daughter.
SAT.
By my troth, never to any person whatsoever have I lent her as yet.
Tox.
Not for that purpose which you are insinuating.
SAT.
Why do you want her then ?
Tox.
You shall know ;
because she's of a pretty and genteel figure.
SAT.
Such is the fact.
Tox.
This Procurer (pointing to the house of DORDALUS) neither knows yourself nor your daughter.
SAT.
How should any one know me, except him who finds me food ?
Tox.
Such is the fact.
This way you can find some money for me.
SAT.
I' faith, I wish I could.
Tox.
Then do you allow me to sell her.
SAT.
You to sell her ?
Tox.
Why no, I'll depute another person to sell her, and to say that he is a foreigner;
since it isn't six months since that Procurer removed hither from Megaras.
SAT.
The remnants are spoiling;
this, however, can be done afterwards.
Tox.
Do you understand on what terms it can ?
Never, on my word, shall you eat here this day, so don't be mistaken, before you declare to me that you'll do this that I'm request­ ing and unless you bring your daughter with you hither at once as soon as you can, by my faith, I'll cashier you from this squad.
What now ?
What's the matter ?
Why don't you say what you will do ?
SAT.
I' troth, prithee sell even myself as well, if you like, so long as you sell me with my stomach full.
Tox.
If you are going to do this, do it.
SAT.
For my part, I'll do what you desire,Tox.
You act kindly.
Make haste, be off home;
cleverly tutor your daughter beforehand, instruct her cunningly, what she is to say, where she is to declare she was born, who were her parents, how she was kidnapped.
But let her declare that she was born at a distance from Athens;
and let her shed tears when she makes mention of it.
SAT.
Now won't you hold your tongue ?
Three times more artful is she than you would have her be.
Tox.
I' troth, you say ,what's excellent.
But do you know what you are to do ?
Get a tunic and a girdle, and bring a scarf and a broad-brimmed hat for him to wear who is to sell 'her to this ProcurerSAT.
Well-capital!
Tox.
As though he were a foreigner.
SAT.
I approve of itTox.
And do you bring your daughter cleverly drest up after a foreign fashion.
SAG. " Ou sont1" the dresses P Tox.
Borrow them of the chorus-leader2.
He ought to lend them ;
the Ædiles3 have contracted for them to be found.
SAT.
I'll have them here just now.
But I'm to be acquainted with nothing of these matters ?
Tox.
I' faith, nothing, in fact.
But, when I've got the money, do you at once claim her of the Procurer.
SAT.
Let him keep her for himself, if I don't immediately carry her off from him.
Tox.
Be off and attend to this.
(Exit SATURIO.)
In the meantime, I want to send a boy to my mistress;
that she may be of good courage, and that I shall manage it to-day.
I'm talking too much at length.
(Goes into the house.)SOPH.
It were enough to tell an untaught, thoughtless, silly girl the same thing so many times over;
really, in fact, I do imagine that I'm quite looked upon by you as a block­ head and a country booby.
Although I do drink wine, still I'm not in the habit of swallowing down your commands together with it.
I really had fancied that both myself and my ways had now been sufficiently proved by you;
for, as for me, I've attended you now these five years;
whereas, in that time, a cuckoo even, I do believe, if he had gone to school, could by now have been made to know his letters well;
while, in the meantime, whether speaking or not speaking1, you have not made yourself acquainted with my disposition.
Can you not hold your tongue ?
Can you not cease advising me ?
I remember, and I know, and I understand, and I keep in mind;
i' faith, you are in love, poor thing ;
on that account your mind's disturbed.
I'll cause that that shall be calmed for you.
LEMN.
Wretched is the person that's in love.
(Goes into the house.)SOPH. (to herself).
Good for nothing, indeed, he certainly is, who is in love with nothing.
What need has that person of life ?
I ought to go, that I may prove obedient to my mistress;
that through my aid she may the sooner become a free woman.
I'll go meet this Toxilus, however;
his ears I'll stuff with what has been enjoined upon me.
(Stands aside.)
Tox.
Are these things quite clear and certain to you—do you quite remember and understand them ?
PÆG.
Better than you who have instructed me.
Tox.
Say you so, you whip-rascal ?
PÆG.
I really do say so.
Tox.
What did I say then PPÆG.
I'll tell it to her all correctly.
Tox.
I' faith, you don't know it.
P޺ÆG. Troth now, lay me a wager that I don't remember and know it all.
Tox.
Why, for my part, I'll lay a wager with you on this, whether you know your own self, how many fingers you have this day upon your hand.
PÆG.
Without hesitation-if you are desirous to lose.
Tox.
A fair truce rather let there be.
PÆG.
For that reason, then, do you let me go.
Tox.
I both bid and permit you.
But I wish you so to attend to it, that you are back home while I'm thinking that you are there.
PÆG. I'll do so.
(Moves towards their own house.)
Tox.
Whither are you now going ?
PÆG.
Home;
that I may be at home while you are thinks ing that I am there.
Tox.
You are a rascal of a boy, andfor this service I'll give you something to add1 to your savings.
PÆG.
I'm aware how want of shame is wont to be imputed to a master's word, and that masters cannot ever be compelled to appear before the judge on account of those promises.
Tox.
Be off now.
PÆG.
I'll give you reason to command me.
Tox.
But, Pægnium, take you care and give that letter to Lemniselene herself, and tell her what I bade you.
SOPH. (apart).
Do I delay to go whither I was sent?
PÆG.
I'm off.
Tox.
Then do be off;
I'll off home.
Take care and manage this business with attention.
Fly post haste.
(Goes into the house.)PÆG.
That's what the ostrich2 is wont to do in the Circus.
He's off from here m-doors there.
But who's this woman that's coming towards me ?
SOPH. (advancing).
Surely this is Pægnium.
PÆG.
This is Sophoclidisca, the private servant of her to whom I'm sent.
SOPH. (aside).
There's not a person this day that's reported to be more artful than this boy.
I'll accost him.
PÆG.
At this bar1 I must come to a stop.
SOPH.
Pægnium, my charmer of a boy, save you;
how are you ?
How do you do ?
PÆG.
Sophoclidisca, the Gods will favour me.
SOPH.
Why “me ?” Which of us ?
PÆG.
I' faith, I don't know.
But if they were to do as you deserve, by my troth they'd hold you in hate, and treat you but badly.
SOPH.
Do leave off your abusive talking.
PÆG.
Since I'm saying just as you I'm talking to deserve, properly, not abusively..
SOPH.
What are you about now ?
P޺ÆG.
Standing opposite to you, looking at a worthless woman.
SOPH.
For my own part, assuredly, I do not know any more good-for-nothing boy than yourself.;
PÆG.
What mischief do I do, or to what person do I speak abusively?
SOPH.
I' faith, to every one that you have the opportunity.
PÆG.
Not an individual has ever thought so.
SOPH.
But, i' faith, full many a one knows that so it is.
PÆG.
Heyday, indeed!
SOPH.
Heyday, indeed!
PÆG.
According to your own disposition you judge of the ways of others.
SOPH.
I certainly do confess that I'm just as befits one of a Procurer's household to be.
PÆG.
I've now'had enough of your chattering.
SOPHi.
What say you ?
Do you plead guilty to what I take you to be ?
PÆG.
If I were so, I should confess it.
SOPH.
Be off then;
you've got the victory.
PÆG.
Now then be off with you.
SOPH, Do you then tell me this-whither are you going ?
PÆG.
Whither are you ?
SOPH.
Say you.
PÆG.
Say you.
SOPH.
I was the first to ask.
PÆG.
Then you shall be the last to know.
SOPH.
I'm going not far hence.
P޺ÆG.
And I, indeed, not far.
SOPH.
Whither then, you rascal ?
PÆG.
Unless I know first of you, you shall never know this of me that you are enquiring.
SOPH.
On my honor you shall never this day know before I've heard it of you.
PÆG.
Is such the fact ?
SOPH.
Is such the fact ?
PÆG.
You are a worthless one.
SOPH.
Rogue.
PÆG.
That befits me.
SOPH.
Me then it does not befit.
PÆG.
What do you say ?
Are you quite determined, you hussy, to conceal whither you are going ?
SOPH.
And are you quite resolved to hide whither you are betaking yourself, you scoundrel ?
PÆG.
You are giving answer to what I say like for like;
be off with you then, since such is your determination.
I don't care at all to know.
Good-bye. (Moving.)SOPH.
Stop!
PÆG.
But I'm in a hurry.
SOPH.
And, i' faith, I as well.
PÆG.
Have you got anything ?
(Pointing to her hand.)SOPH.
Have you anything ?
(Pointing likewise.)PÆG. Really nothing whatever.
PÆG. (showing his right hand).
Is this the hand ?
SOPH.
Where is that other, the pilfering left hand PPÆG.
(hiding his left hand).
Why, it is at home, d'ye see;
I've not brought one hither.
SOPH. (trying to seize his hand).
You've got something, what it is I know not.
P޺ÆG. (pushing her away).
Don't be mauling me about you she-groper.
SOPH.
But suppose I'm in love with you.
PEG.
You employ your pains to no purpose.
SOPH.
Why so?
PEG.
Why, because you are in love with nothing at all, when you are in love with one who doesn't return it.
SOPH.
It befits these youthful looks and age to be on the watch for pleasure in good time;
so that, when your hair comes to change its hue, you may not be always in a gro­ yelling servitude.
Why, really, as yet you are not eighty pounds in weight.
PÆG.
Still, that warfare is waged much more successfully by spirit than by weight.
But I'm losing my pains.
SOPH.
Why so PP޺ÆG.
Because I'm teaching those who know it all.
But I'm loitering here.
(Moves.)SOPH.
(taking hold of him).
Do stop.
PEG.
You are annoying to me.
SOPH.
And so I shall be then, if I don't find out whither you are betaking yourself.
PÆG.
To your house.
SOPH.
And I to your house, i' faith.
SOPH.
What's that to you ?PÆG. (standing before her).
Why, you shan't go now, unless, in return, I know.
SOPH.
You are teazing.
PÆG. I choose to.
SOPH.
Never, upon my faith, shall you wring this out of me, so as to prove yourself more artful than I am.
PEG.
It's a misery to contend with you in artfulness.
SOPH.
You are a mischievous baggage.
PÆG.
What is there for you to fear ?
SOPH.
The very same that there is for you.
PÆG.
Say then, what is it ?
SOPH.
But I'm forbidden to tell this to any person, and am instructed that all the dumb people are to speak of it before myself.
PÆG.
And most especially was I cautioned not to trust this to any person, so that all the dumb people were to men.
tion this before myself.
SOPH.
Still, do you do so;
on giving our words, let's trust each other.
PÆG. 1 know this—all procuresses are light of faith, and the weight of a water-gnat1 is not more light than is the word of a procurer.
SOPH.
Tell me, there's a dear.
PÆG.
Tell me, there's a dear.
SOPH.
I don't want to be your dear.
PÆG.
You'll easily prevail upon me in that.
SOPH.
Keep it yourself.
PÆG.
And you be mum about this.
(Showing her a letter.)SOPH.
It shall be kept a secret.
PÆG.
It shall not be known.
(She shows him a letter.)SOPH.
I'm carrying this letter to Toxilus, your master.
PÆG.
Be off;
he's there at home.
And I am carrying this pinewood tablet sealed, to Lemniselene, your mistress.
SOPH.
What's written there.
PÆG.
If you don't know, pretty much like yourself, I don't know, except soft words, perhaps.
SOPH.
I'm off.
PÆG.
And I'll be off.
SOPH.
Move on then.
( Theygo into the respective houses.)SAG. (to himself).
To Jove the opulent, the renowned, the son of Ops2, the strong, the mighty in power, who riches, hopes, kind plenty does bestow, joyously and grate­ fully do I offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, inasmuch as in a friendly way they have bestowed for my friend this opportunity of satisfying his necessity and of borrowing the money, so that I can lend him aid in his need.
Whereas I no more dreamed, or thought, or imagined that I should have this opportunity-that same has now fallen from heaven as it were.
For my master has sent me to Eretria8;
he has given me the money to purchase some trained oxen for him;
but he said that the fair would take place seven days hence;
a simpleton to trust this money to me whose propensity he knew;
for this money I shall misapply in some other purpose:
there were no oxen for me to buy.
Now I'll both promote the success of my friend, and will give my in­ clination full enjoyment.
The pleasures that belong to a Iong time will I serve up in a single day.
Crack, crack1 it will be upon my back;
I don't care.
Now, to a person that is my friend I shall present these trained oxen from out of my purse;
for this, in fact, is a delightful thing, handsomely to bite your thrice-dotted niggardly, antiquated, covetous, spiritless people, who against their servant seal up the salt­ cellar with the salt..
It's a virtue, when occasion prompts, to hold them in contempt.
What will he do to me ?
He'll order me to be beaten with stripes, the fetters to be put on.
I may get a beating.
Don't let him fancy that I shall go negging to him.
Woe be unto him !
Nothing new can now be inflicted upon me but what I have already experienced it.
But see, here comes Pægnium, Toxilus's boy.PÆG. (to himself).
My task that was set me I've finished;
now I'm hastening home.
SAG.
Stop, although you are in haste-Pægnium, listen to me.
PÆG.
You ought to buy a person, for you to desire to be obedient to you.
(Moves on.)SAG.
Stop there, I say.
PÆG.
You'd be giving some trouble, I fancy, if I were to be owing you anything, who are now so troublesome.
SAG.
You rascal, will you look back then ?
PÆG.
I am aware of what age I am;
for that reason you.
shall get off for this abuse with impunity.
SAG.
Where is Toxilus, your master ?PÆG.
Wherever he pleases, and he don't ask your advice.
SAG.
Won't you tell me, then, where he is, you villain ?
PÆG.
I don't know, I say, you eim-twig spoiler1.
SAG.
You are abusive to your senior.
PÆG.
As you deserved it first, do you put up with it.
My master bade me hold my labour at his bidding, my tongue in freedom.
SAG.
Will you not tell me, where is Toxilus PPÆG.
I tell you that—you may go to perdition ever­ lasting.
SAG.
This day you shall be flogged with a rope's end.
PÆG.
On your account, indeed, you cuckoo!
I' faith, you carrion, if I were to give you a broken head, I shouldn't be afraid of that.
SAG.
I understand you, you've been up to2 some bad work just now.
PÆG.
So I have.
What business is that to you P But I haven't, like yourself, all for nothing.
SAG.
Assurance!PÆG.
I' faith, I certainly am;
for I am assured that I shall be free;
don't be hoping that you'll ever be so.
SAG.
Can't you cease your impertinence PP.ÆG.
That which you are mentioning, you can't do your self.
SAG.
Away with you to utter perdition.
PÆG.
And off home with you;
for there it's all ready prepared for you.
SAG.
He summons me3 on my recognizances.
PÆG.
I only wish the sureties may be out of the way, so that you may get to prison.
SAG.
Why's this ?
PÆG.
Aye, why is it PSAG.
Still abusing me, rascal ?
PÆG.
Why, inasmuch as you are a slave, it ought at least to be allowed a slave to abuse you.
SAC.
And is it so ?
Just look (holding up his fist) what I shall give you.
PÆG.
Nothing ;
for nothing have you.
SAG.
May all the Gods and Goddesses confound me, if I don't this very day, if I lay hold of you, fell you to the ground with blows.
PÆG.
I am your friend;
I trust that what you wish may befall you, and that it may come to pass;
if you fell me1, may others make you feel yourself fixed to the cross before long.
SAG.
But you may the Gods and Goddesses—You understand what I was going to say after that, if I hadn't been able to restrain my tongue.
Can't you be off?
PÆG.
You drive me off with ease;
for already my sha­ dow's getting2 a whipping in-doors.
(Goes into the house.)SAG. (to himself).
May the Gods and Goddesses confound that fellow!
just like a crawling serpent he has got a double tongue, and is a wicked one.
Upon my faith, I'm glad he's gone.
(Going towards the door.)
Open, you door.
But look!
he's coming from within, the person that I most especially wished to meet with.
Tox. (to SOPHOCLIDISCA).
Tell her that it's now arranged whence the money is to come.
Bid her be of good heart;
tell her that I love her exceedingly.
When she cheers up, then does she cheer me up.
What I've told you to tell her, do you quite understand it ?
SOPH.
Better than your legs3 under-stand you, do I under- stand it.
Toy.
Make all haste, be off home.
(SOPHOCLIDISCA goes into the house of DORDALUS.)SAG. (apart).
Now I'll make myself a perfect droll towards him;
I'll carry myself with arms akimbo, and assume a lordly air1.
(Struts along.)
Tox.
But who's this that'a walking like a two-handled jug2 ?SAG. (apart).
I'll spit about me in a dignified style.
(Spits about.)
Tox.
Why, surely this is Sagaristio.
How are you.
Saga­ ristio ?
How do you do ?
Is there any tiny hope in you as to that which I entrusted to you ?
SAG.
(in a lofty way).
Step this way;
it shall be seen to;
I would have it done.
Advance-move forward.
Tox.
What's this swellingS here upon your neck?
(Touches his neck.)SAG.
It's a tumour;
forbear to press it, for when any person touches it with a rude hand, pain is the result.
Tox.
When did that first come upon you ?
SAG.
To-day.
Tox.
You should order it to be lanced.
SAG.
I'm afraid to lance it before it's ripe, lest it should cause me more trouble.
Tox.
I'd like to examine your complaint.
(Comes nearer.)SAG. . (retreating).
Be off, and do be careful, will you, of the horns.
Tox.
Why so ?
SAG.
Because a couple of oxen are here in the purse.
Tox.
Do let them out, please;
don't starve them with hunger-do let them go to pasture.
SAG.
Why, I'm afraid that I mayn't be able to drive them back to their stall, lest they should wander.
Tox.
I'll drive them back;
be of good heart.
SAG.
You shall be trusted then;
I'll lend them you Follow this way, please (taking the purse from his neck) ;
in this there is the money which you were asking me for a short time since.
Tox.
What is it you say ?
SAG.
My master has sent me to Eretria to purchase some oxen;
at present my Eretria shall be this house of yours.
Tox.
You speak quite enchantingly;
and I shall very soon return you all the money safe;
for now I've ar­ ranged and put in readiness all my devices, in which way I'm to get this money out of this Procurer.
SAG.
So much the better.
Tox.
Both for the damsel to be set at liberty, and, still far­ ther, for himself to pay the money.
But follow me;
I have need of your assistance in this affair.
SAG.
Make use of it just as you please.
(They go into the house.)SAT.
May this same matter turn out well for me, and for yourself, and for my stomach, and for everlasting victuals for it as well for all time to come;
that I may have more than enough, a superfluity, and that it may outlast me.
Follow me this way, my daughter, with the Gods' good leave.
The matter to which we are to give our attention, you know, you remember, you understand ;
to you I have commu­ nicated all my designs.
For that reason have I dressed you out after this fashion;
young woman, to-day you are to be sold.
DAU.
Prithee, my dear father, although you do eagerly long for victuals at another's cost, are you for the sake of your appetite going to sell your own daughter ?
SAT.
It is a wonder, indeed, if I don't sell you, who are my own, for the sake of King Philip or Attalus2, rather than my own.
DAU.
Whether do you regard me as your slave or as your daughter ?
SAr.
I' faith, that of the two which shall appear most for the interest of my stomach;
it's my authority over you, I suppose, not yours over me.
DAU.
This power is yours, father;
but still, although our circumstances are but very limited, it's better to pass our lives with frugality and moderation;
for if disgrace is added to poverty, poverty will be more unendurable, our character more frail.
SAT.
Why really you are impertinent.
DAU.
I am not, nor do I think that I am, when, though of youthful age, I give good advice to my father.
For enemies carry about slander not in the form in which it took its rise.
SAT.
Let them carry it about, and let them go to utter and extreme perdition.
I don't value all their enmities any more than if an empty table were now set before me.
DAU.
Father, the scandal of men is everlasting;
even then does it survive, when you would suppose it to be dead.
SAT.
What ?
Are you afraid lest I should sell you ?
DAU.
I am not afraid of that, father;
but I wish you not to pretend to do so.
SAT.
Then it's in vain you wish me not;
this shall be done rather after my own fashion than yours.
SAT.
What is the matter, now?
DAU.
Father, reflect upon these words:
if a master has threatened punishment to a slave, although it is not in­ tended to be, still, when the whip is taken up, while he is taking off his tunics, with what an amount of misery is he afflicted.
Now, that which is not to be, I'm still in fear of.
SAT.
Damsel or woman none will there ever be, but what she must be good for nothing, who is too wise to be giving satisfaction to her parents.
DAU.
Damsel and woman none can there be, but what she must be good for nothing, who holds her peace if she sees anything going on wrong.
SAT.
'Twere better for you to beware of a mischief.
DAU.
But if I cannot beware, what am I to do ?
For it'a as to yourself I wish to beware.
DAU.
You are not, nor is it becoming for me to say so;
but for this purpose am I using my endeavours, that others may not say so who have that liberty.
SAT.
Let each one say what he pleases;
from this purpose I shall not be moved.
DAU.
But, could it be after my own way, you would be acting prudently, rather than foolishly.
SAT.
It is my pleasure.
DAU.
I know that I must let it be your pleasure so far as I'm concerned;
but it should not please you to be your pleasure, if I had my way.
SAT.
Are you going to be obedient to your father's orders, or not ?
DAU.
To be obedient.
SAT.
Do you know then what I instructed you ?
DAU.
Everything.
SAT.
Both this, how you were stolen ?
DAU.
I understand it perfectly well.
SAT.
And who your parents were ?
DAU.
I keep it in my memory.
You cause me of neces­ sity to be artful;
but take you care, when you wish to give me in marriage, that this story doesn't cause the match to be given up.
SAT.
Hold your tongue, simpleton.
Do you not see the customs of people now-a-days, that marriage is easily effected here with a reputation of any kind ?
So long as there's a marriage-portion, no fault is reckoned as a fault.
DAU.
Then take you care, and let this occur to your thoughts, that I am without a fortune.
SAT.
Take you care, please, how you say that.
By my faith, through the merits of the Gods and of my ancestors I'll say it, you must not say that you are without a fortune, WhO nave a marriage-portion at home.
Why look, I've got a whole carriage-full1 of books at home.
If you carefully give your attention to this matter in which we are exerting ourselves, six hundred bon-mots shall be given you out of them as a fortune, all Attic ones2, too ;
you shall not receive a single Sicilian one.
With this for a fortune, you might safely marry a beggar even1.
DAU.
Why, then, don't you take me, father, if you are going to take me anywhere ?
Either do you sell me, or do with me what you please.
SAT.
You ask what's fair and right.
Follow me this way.
DAU.
I'm obedient to your command.
(They go into the house, to TOXILUS.)DOR. (to himself).
I wonder what I'm to say my neighbour is going to do, who swore to me that he would pay the money to-day P
But if he should not pay it, and this day go by, I shall have forfeited the money, he his oath.
But the door there makes a noise.
I wonder who's coming out of doors ?
Tox. (speaking at the door to the PERSONS within).
Take you care of that in-doors;
I shall betake myself home just now.
DOR.
Toxilus, how are you ?
Tox.
How now!-pimping filth mixed up with mud!
How now!—public dung-heap!
dirty, dishonest, lawless, enticer, disgrace to the public;
you hawk after money, greedy and envious;
you impudent, rapacious, craving fellow (in three hundred lines no person could run through your villanies), will you take the money ?
(Holding out the purse.)
Take the money, will you, shame­ less fellow.
Take hold of the money, will you.
Are you going to take the money, then P Can I make you take the money, filth ?
(Keeps moving it away.)
You didn't suppose that I should have had so much money—you, who didn't venture to trust me at all except upon oath ?
DOR.
Do let me recover breath, so as to give you an answer.
Fellow, dregs of the populace, you stable for she­ slaves, you liberator of harlots, you surface for the lash, you wearer-out of the fetters, you citizen of the treadmill, you slave everlastingly, you gormandizer, glutton, pilferer, run­ away, give me the money, will you.
Give me the money, impudence.
Can I get the money out of you?
Give me the money, I say.
Why don't you give me the money ?
Are you ashamed of nothing ?
You impersonation of sla­ very, a Procurer is asking money of you for the liberation of your mistress, so that all may hear it.
Tox.
Troth now, prithee, do hold your tongue.
For sure your voice is in first-rate strength.
DOR.
I've got a tongue made for returning a compliment.
Salt is provided for me at the same price as for yourself;
Unless this tongue protects me, it shall never lick a bit of salt.
Tox.
I'll cease to be angry now.
It was for this I blamed you, because you refused to trust me for the money.
DOR.
'Twas a wonder, indeed, that 1 didn't trust you, that you might do the same to me that some of the bankers do1.
When you've entrusted them with anything, they imme­ diately run more quickly away from the Forum than a hare, when, at the games2, he's let out of the entrance of his cage.
Tox. ([holding out the money).
Take this, will you.
DOR.
Why don't you give it then ?
Tox. (giving it).
There will be here six hundred di­ drachms, full weight and counted;
cause the damsel to be set at liberty, and bring her out here forthwith.
DOR.
I'll have her here this moment.
I' faith, I don't know to whom now to give this money to be tested3.
Tox.
Perhaps you are afraid to entrust it to any one's hands ?
DOR.
Strange if I wasn't.
More quickly, now-a- days, do bankers abscond from the Forum, than a wheel spins round in a race.
Tox. (pointing).
Do you go that way, through the alleys, the back way to the Foruml;
let this damsel pass through the same way to our house, through the garden.
DOR.
I'll have her here this moment.
Tox.
But not in public view.
DOR.
Very discreet.
Tox.
To-morrow she must go to return thanks2.
DOR.
I' faith, just so indeed.
Tox.
While you've been loitering, you might have got back.
(Exit DORDALUS ;
TOXILUS goes into the house.)Tox. (to himself.).
If you give attention to any matter with steadiness or with good management, that same is wont properly to thrive to your satisfaction.
And, by my faith, pretty nearly according as each man gives attention to his business, in the same manner do the results3 finally ensure him success.
If he is knavish or a rogue, the business turDS out badly which he has commenced;
but if he uses good management, it results profitably.
Cleverly and skilfully did I commence upon this business;
for that reason do I trust that it will turn out well for me.
Now, I'll this day have the Procurer so hampered, that he shan't know himself which way to extricate himself.
(Goes to the door.)
Saga- ristio, hallo!
Come forth, and bring out the ycung woman, and that letter which I sealed for you, which you brought me all the way from Persia, from my master.
SAG.
Have I delayed at all ?
Tox.
Bravo! bravo!
dressed out in splendid style.
(To SAGARISTIO.)
The tiara1 does finely set off your dress.
Then, too, how beautifully does the slipper become this stranger damsel!
But are you thoroughly up in your parts ?
SAG.
Tragedians and Comedians have never been up so well.
Tox.
Troth, you-are giving me kind assistance.
Come, be off that way (pointing), to a distance out of sight, and hold your tongue.
When you see me conversing with the Procurer, that will be the time to accost us;
now be off, you, -away with you.
(SAGARISTIO and the DAMSEL go aside, out of sight.)DOR. (to himself).
The man to whom the Deities are pro­ pitious, in his way they throw some profit.
For I this day have made a saving of two loaves daily;
this way, she who this day was my slave is now her own;
by his cash he has prevailed;
this day then she'll be dining at the expense of another, she'll be tasting nothing of mine.
Am I not a worthy man, am I not a courteous citizen, who this day have made the extensive state of Attica still larger, and increased it by a female citizen ?
But how obliging have I been to-day!
To how many have I given credit, and have from no person taken surety ;
so readily did I give credit to all:
and I don't fear that of those whom I've trusted to-day any one will forswear himself against me upon trial.
I wish from this day forth to be honest-a thing that never will be and never was.
Tox. (apart).
This fellow, this very day, by clever contri­ vances, I'll catch in a springe;
and so the snare is cunningly laid for him;
I'll accost the fellow.
(Aloud.)
What are you about ?
DOR.
Giving credit.
Tox.
Whence do you betake yourself, Dordalus ?
DOR.
I'm going to give you credit1.
Tox.
May the Gods grant whatever you may desire.
How now, have you given the damsel her liberty by this ?
DOR.
I'm going to give you credit, i' faith, I'm going to give you credit, I repeat.
Tox.
Are you now increased in number by one freed- woman ?
DOR.
You worry me to death.
Why, I tell you that I'll give you credit.
Tox.
Tell me in sober truth, is she now at liberty ?
DOR.
Go, go to the Forum, to the Prætor2;
make all en­ quiries, since you don't choose to give me credit.
She is at liberty, I say.
Do you hear me at all ?
Tox.
May all the Deities bless you then.
And never from this time forward, will I wish to you or yours what you don't wish.
DOR.
Be off:
don't be swearing that.
I quite believe you.
Tox.
Where is your freed-woman now ?
DOR.
At your house.
Tox.
Do you say so ?
Is she at our house ?
DOR.
I do say so, I tell you;
she is at your house, I say.
Tox.
So may the Deities favour me, for this thing many blessings from me are in store for you:
for there's a certain matter, which I refrained from mentioning to you ;
now I'll disclose it, and from it you can make a very large profit.
I'll give you cause to remember me so long as you exist.
DOR.
My ears are wanting some kind deeds by way of assistance to these kind words.
Tox.
It's only your deserts, that I should do as you de­ serve.
And that you may know that I will do so, take this letter (showing him a letter) ;
read it over.
DOR.
What has this got to do with me ?
Tox.
Why yes, it bears reference to yourself, and it does relate to you.
But it has just now been brought me from Persia, from my master.
DOR.
When ?
Tox.
Not long since.
DOR.
What does it say PTox.
Make enquiry of its own self:
it will tell you itself.
DOR.
Give it me, then.
(Taking it from TOXILUS.)Tox.
But read it aloud.
DOR.
Be silent while I read it over.
Tox.
I'll not utter a word.
DOR. (reading). " Timarchides sends health to Toxilus and all the family.
If you are well, I am glad;
I am quite well, and carrying on my business, and am making money;
and I am not able to return home for these eight months, for there is some business which detains me here;
the Per­ sians have taken Chrysopolis1, a city of Arabia, full of good things, and an ancient town ;
there the booty is being col­ lected, that a public auction may be made;
this matter causes me to be absent from home.
I wish attention and hospitality to be shown to the person who brings this letter to you.
Attend to what he wants;
for at his own house at home he has shown me the greatest attentions."
What has it to do with me or my welfare, what matters the Persians are about, or what your master is doing ?
Tox.
Hold your tongue, silly babbler;
you don't know what blessing awaits you.
It's in vain that Fortune is ready to light for you her torch that leads to profit.
DOR.
What Fortune is this that leads to profit ?
Tox. (pointing to the letter).
Ask that which knows:
I know about as much as yourself, except that I was the first to read it through.
But as you've begun, learn the matter from the letter.
DOR.
You counsel me aright.
Keep silence.
Tox.
Now you'll come to that which does relate to your interest.
DOR. (reading on). "
The person that brings this letter, has taken with him a well-bred female of engaging charms, who has been stolen, and brought from the in- most parts of Arabia;
I wish you to take charge of her that she may be sold there;
but he who makes purchase of her, must buy her at his own risk;
nobody will promise or give a warranty.
Take you care that he receives money full weight and counted.
Pay attention to this, and give attention that the stranger is attended to.
Farewell."Tox.
What then ?
After you have read over what has been committed to the wax, do you believe me now ?
DOR.
Where now is this stranger that brought this let­ ter ?
Tox.
He'll be here just now, I believe;
he has sent for her from the ship.
DOR.
I don't want any lawsuits or quirks at all.
Why should I be laying out so much money at such a distance P Unless I get her on warranty, what need have I of this purchase ?
Tox.
Will you, or will you not, hold your tongue ?
I never did believe you to be such a blockhead.
What are you afraid of?
DOR.
I' faith, I really am afraid;
I've experienced it now so many times, and it will not befall me without having already experienced it, to be getting stuck in such a quag­ mire.
Tox.
There seems to be no risk.- DOR.
I know that;
but I'm afraid about myself.
Tox.
It matters nothing whatever to me, so far as I'm concerned ;
it's for your sake I mentioned it, that I might at the earliest moment give you an opportunity of advanta­ geously purchasing her.
DOR.
I return you thanks ;
but it's a nicer thing for you to become wise through others, than for others through yourself.
Tox.
Surely no person can follow after her from the in­ most parts of Arabia.
Will you make purchase of her, then ?
DOR.
Only let me see the commodity.
Tox.
You say what's fair.
But look, most a propos, the stranger is coming himself, who brought this letter hither.
DOR. (pointing down the side-scene).
Is that he ?
Tox.
That's he.
DOR.
And is that the girl that was stolen PTox.
I know just about as well as yourself, except that I have seen her.
Upon my faith, she certainly is genteel look­ ing, whoever she is.
DOR.
Faith, she has pretty regular features.
Tox. (aside).
With what contempt the hang-dog does seak of her.
( To DORDALUS.)
Let's examine her beauty in silence.
DOR.
I approve of your advice.
(They stand aside.)SAG.
Doesn't Athens seem to you a rich and opulent place ?
DAU.
I've seen the appearance of the city;
the customs of the people I've observed but little of.
Tox. (apart).
At the very outset has she forborne to make a wise remark.
DOR. (apart).
I cannot by her very first words form an estimate of her wisdom.
SAG.
What as to that which you have seen ?
How does the city seem fortified to you, with its wall ?
DAU.
If the inhabitants have good morals, I think it's pro­ perly fortified.
If Perfidiousness, and Peculation, and Avarice are exiled from the city, Envy in the fourth place, Ambition in the fifth, Scandal in the sixth, Perjury in the seventh.
DAU.
Idleness in the eighth, Injustice in the ninth, Immo­ rality, which is the very worst in its attack, in the tenth.
If these things shall not be away from it, a wall a hundred-fold were too little for preserving its interests.
Tox. (apart).
What say you?
DOR. (apart).
What do you mean ?
Tox. (apart).
You are among those ten companions;
you must depart in banishment from here.
DOR. (apart).
Why so?
Tox. (apart).
Because you are perjured.
DOR. (apart).
Really she has spoken not without some cleverness.
Tox. (apart).
That's to your advantage, I say;
you buy her.
DOR. (apart).
Upon my faith, the more I look at her, the more she pleases me.
Tox. (apart).
If you do buy her, immortal Gods, no other Procurer will be more wealthy than yourself;
at your will you'll be turning people out of their estates and households ;
you'll be transacting business with men of the highest rank ;
they'll be longing for your favour;
they'll be coming to make merry at your house.
DOR. (apart).
But I shan't allow them to be admitted.
Tox. (apart).
But then at night they'll be singingl before your threshold, and be burning down your door ;
do you at once order your house to be fastened with a door of iron2, change for a house of iron, fix in thresholds of iron, a bar of iron and a ring ;
if you don't prove sparing of the iron, do you order thick fetters of iron to be rivetted upon yourself.
DOR. (apart).
Away to utter perdition !
Tox. (pushing him).
Go then, make purchase of her, and follow my advice.
DOR. (apart).
Only let me know how much he asks for her.
Tox. (apart).
Should you like me to call him here ?
DOR. (apart).
I'll go to him.
Tox. (accosting him).
How fare you, guest ?
SAG.
I'm come;
I've brought her (pointing to the DAM­ SEL), as I just now said I would.
For yesterday at night the ship arrived in harbour:
I want her to be sold, if she can if she cannot, I intend to go away from here as soon as I can.
DOR.
Greetings to you, young man.
SAG.
If indeed I shall dispose of her at her own priceTox.
(pointing to DORDALUS).
Why, you'll either sell her handsomely with him for your purchaser, or you can to no one.
SAG.
Are you a friend of his ?
Tox.
In the same measure as all the Divinities who inhabit the heavens.
DOR.
Then you are an assured enemy to me;
for to the race of procurers no God was ever so kind as to prove pro­ pitious.
SAG.
Attend to the business in hand.
Have you any need to purchase her PDOR.
If you have need for her to be sold, I, too, have need to purchase her;
if you have no sudden occasion to sell, just in the same degree have I to buy.
SAG.
State a sum;
name a price.
DOR.
The commodity is your own;
it's for you to name a sum.
Tox. (to SAGARISTIO).
He asks what's right.
SAG.
Do you wish to buy at a bargain ?
DOB.
Do you wish to sell at a handsome profit ?
Tox.
I' faith, I'm sure that both of you would like to do so.
DOR.
Come, boldly name your price.
SAG.
I tell you beforehand ;
no one will dispose of her to you on warranty.
Do you so understand it, then ?
DOR.
I understand it.
Declare what's the lowest price at which you'll offer her, for which she may be taken by the purchaser.
Tox.
Hold your tongue, hold your tongue.
Really, upon my faith, you are a very simple man, with your childish ways.
Tox.
Why because I wish you first to make enquiries )f the damsel which relate to your interest.
DOR.
And really, upon my faith, you've given me no bad advice.
Look at that, will you.
I, an experienced Procurer, had almost fallen into the pit, if you had not been here.
How important a point it is to have a person your friend at hand when you are about anything.
Tox.
I want you to make enquiry of her, of what family or in what country she was born, or of what parents, so that you mayn't say that you've bought her at hazard by my persuasion or suggestion.
DOR.
On the contrary, I approve of your counsel, I tell you.
Tox. (to SAGARISTIO).
Unless it's troublesome, he's de­ sirous to make a few enquiries of her.
SAG.
By all means;
at his own pleasure.
Tox. (to DORDALUS).
Why do you delay ?
Go to him yourself;
and do you yourself ask him as well, that you may be allowed to make such enquiries as you please;
although he has told me that he gives permission to do so of her, still I had rather that you yourself should go to aim, that he mayn't be holding you in contempt.
DOR.
You give me very proper advice.
(Accosting SAGA­ RISTIO.)
Stranger, I should like to ask some questions of her.
(Pointing to the YOUNG WOMAN.)SAG.
From earth to heaven, whatever you like.
DOR.
Just bid her to step this way to me.
SAG. (to the YOUNG WOMAN).
Go you, then, and humour him.
(To DORDALUS.)
Make enquiry, question her, just as you please.
Tox. (to DORDALUS).
Well, welll, get on then;
make your preparations.
(Aside to the YOUNG WOMAN.)
Take you care to commence with a good omen.
DAU.
The auspices are favourable.
Tox. (Aside to the YOUNG WOMAN).
Hold your tongue.
( To DORDALUS.)
Step you aside here;
I will now conduct her to you.
DOR.
Do what you think is most for my interest.
Tox. (to the YOUNG WOMAN, who advances with him).
Follow me.
(To DORDALUS.)
I've brought her, if you are wishful to make any enquiries of her.
DOR.
But I want you to be present.
Tox.
I cannot do otherwise than pay attention to this stranger (pointing to SAGARISTIO), whom my master bade me show courtesy to.
What if he doesn't choose that I should be present together with you ?
SAG.
Yes, but do come.
Tox. (to DORDALUS).
I'll lend you my assistance, then.
DOR.
You're lending it yourself as well when you are assisting your friend.
Tox.
Examine her.
(Aside to the YOUNG WOMAN.)
Hark you, be on your guard.
DAU. (aside).
Enough has been said to me.
(Aloud.)
Although I am a slave, I know my duty, so that whatever he asks I'll tell the truth as I have heard it.
Tox. (pointing to DORDALUS).
Young woman, this is an honorable man.
DAU.
I believe you.
Tox.
You'll not be long in servitude with him.
DAU.
I' faith, and so I trust, if my parents do their duty.
DOR.
I do not wish you to be surprised, if we make en­ quiries of you about either your country or your parents.
DAU.
Why should I be surprised at that, my dear sir ?
My state of servitude has forbidden me to be surprised at any misfortune of my own.
Tox. (aside).
May the Gods confound her!
so cunning and crafty is she.
She has got shrewd sense:
how readily she does say what's needed.
DOR.
What's your name ?
Tox. (aside).
Now I'm afraid she'll be tripping.
DAU.
My name was Lucrisl in my own country.
Tox.
The name and the omen are worth any price.
Why don't you make purchase of her ? (Aside.)
I was greatly afraid that she would be tripping.
She has got herself free.
DOR.
If I make purchase of you, I trust that you'll prove Lucris to myself as well.
Tox.
If you do make purchase of her, never, on my word, do I think that she'll remain your slave throughout the month.
DOR.
And so indeed I'd hope, i' faith.
Tox.
That what you wish may come to pass, employ your own energies.
(Aside.)
In nothing even as yet has she made a slip.
DOR.
Where were you born ?
DAU.
According to what my mother told me,in the kitchen2, in.
a corner on the left hand.
Tox. (to DORDALUS).
This woman will prove a lucky Courtesan for you;
she has been born in a warm spot, where full oft there is an abundance of all good things.
(Aside.)
The Procurer was taken in when he asked where she was born.
She has played him off nicely.
DOR.
But I ask of you, what is your country ?
DAU.
What should be mine but that where I now am ?
DOR.
But this I'm asking, what was ?
DAU.
Everything that was, do I consider as nothing, since it was, and is not now.
Just like a man when he has breathed forth his spirit;
why enquire of him who he was ?
Tox. (aside).
So may the Deities kindly favour me, right cleverly.
And yet I really do pity her.
DOR.
But still, young woman, come, tell me at once which is your country ?
Why are you silent ?
DAU.
For my part, I really am telling you my country.
Since I'm in servitude here, this is my country.
Tox.
Do cease now making enquiries about that.
Don't you see that she's unwilling to declare, lest you should recall to her the remembrance of her misfortunes PDOR.
What's the matter ?
Is your father in captivity ?
DAU.
Not in captivity;
but what he had, he has lost.
Tox.
She will prove to be born of a good family;
she knows how to say nothing but the truth.
DOR.
Who was he ?
Tell me his name ?
DAU.
Why should I tell of him, wretched man, who he was ?
For the present 'twere proper for him to be called Miserable, and me Miserable.
DOR.
What kind of a person was he considered by the public ?
DAU.
Not a person more acceptable;
slaves and free persons all liked him.
Tox.
You do speak of a miserable man, inasmuch as he'a almost lost himself, and has lost his friends.
DOR.
I shall purchase her, I think.
Tox.
What, still “ I think ?"DOR.
I imagine that she's of a noble family.
Tox.
You'll make riches by her.
DOR.
May the Gods grant it so.
Tox.
Do you only buy her.
DAU.
Now this I tell you:
my father will be here di­ rectly, when he knows that I've been sold, and will ransom me thus separated from him.
Tox.
What say you now ?
DOR.
What's the matter ?
Tox.
Do you hear what she says ?
DAU.
For although his fortunes are broken, he still has friends.
(Pretends to cry.)DOR.
Don't weep, please;
you'll soon be at liberty, if— you have sweethearts enough1.
Would you like to belong to me?
DAU.
So long, indeed, as I don't belong to you too long, I'd like.
Tox.
How well she does keep in mind her liberty.
She'll be producing you fine hauls.
About it, if you are about it.
I'll go back to him.
(To the YOUNG WOMAN.)
Do you follow me.
To SAGARISTIO.)
I've brought her back to you.
DOR.
Young man, are you disposed to sell her PSAG.
I'd like it, rather than lose her.
DOR.
Do you compress it then into a few words;
state the price at which she's offered.
SAG.
I'll do so, as I see you wish it.
Take her for a hundred minæ.
DOR.
That's too much.
SAG.
For eighty.
DOR.
That's too much.
SAG.
There can't a didrachm be abated from the price which I shall now name.
DOR.
What is it, then ?
Speak out at once and name it.
SAG.
At your own risk, she's offered at sixty minæ.
Tox. (aside to DORDALUS).
The Gods and Goddesses are pursuing you with their vengeance, you rogue, for not making haste to purchase her.
DOR.
Take them, then.
Tox.
Well done, you have got a rich prize!
Be off, and fetch the money out here.
On my faith, she's not dear at three hundred minæ.
SAG.
Hark you, for her clothing there'll be ten minæ added to this as well.
DOR.
Yes, be deducted, not added.
Tox.
Do hold your tongue, will you;
don't you see that he's seeking an excuse to have the bargain broken?
Why don't you be off and fetch the money ?
DOR. (to TOXILUS, as he is going).
Hark you, do you keep an eye upon him.
Tox.
Why don't you then go in ?
DOR.
I'll go and fetch the money.
(Goes into his house.)Tox.
Upon my word, young lady, you have given us praise worthy aid, good, and wise, and sensible.
DAU.
If for good persons anything good is done, the same is wont to be both important and pleasing.
Tox.
Do you hear, you Persian, when you've got the money of him, do you pretend as though you are going straight to the ship.
SAG.
Don't teach me.
Tox.
Betake yourself back again to our house, that way (pointing) down the lane through the garden.
SAG.
You are naming what's intended to be done.
Tox.
But don't you at once be changing your quarters with the money, I recommend you.
SAG.
What's worthy of yourself, do you take to be worthy of me ?
Tox.
Hold your tongue;
lower your voice;
the spoil is coming out of doors.
DOR.
Sixty minæ of assayed silver are here (pointing at the bag), less two didrachms.
SAG.
What's the meaning of those didrachms ?
DOR.
To pay for this bag, or else to cause it to come home again.
SAG.
Lest you mightn't be enough of a Procurer, did you fear, wretched, filthy, avaricious creature, that you might lose your bag ?
Tox.
Pray, let him alone;
since he is a Procurer, he isn't doing anything surprising.
DOR.
I've judged from omens that I should make some profit to-day;
nothing is of value so small to me, but that I grudge to lose it.
Come, take this, will you ?
(Holds out the bag to SAGARISTIO.)SAG.
Place it around my neck, if it is not too much trouble.
DOR.
Certainly, it shall be done.
(Hangs it round his neck.)SAG.
Is there anything else that you wish with me ?
Tox.
Why are you in such haste ?
SAG.
My business is of that nature;
the letters that have been entrusted me, I want to deliver;
and I've heard that mv twin-brother's a slave here;
I wish to be off to seek him out, and redeem him.
Tox.
And, i' faith, you've not badly put me in mind of it;
I think that I've seen here one very like you in figure, of just the same size.
SAG.
Why, it must surely be my brother1.
DOR.
But we'd like to know what your name is.
Tox.
What does it matter to us to know ?
SAG.
Listen then, that you may know;
my name is Lying­ speakerus2, Virgin-seller-onides, Trifle-great-talker-ides, Sil­ ver-screwer-outides, Thee-worthy-to-talk-to-ides, Wheedler­ out-of-coin-ides, What-he-has-once-got-hold-of-ides, Never- again-part-with-it-ides.
DOR.
Dear me;
upon my faith, this name of yours is written in many ways.
SAG.
Such is the way with the Persians;
we have long names of many words twisted together.
Do you wish for anything else ?
SAG.
And youfarewell;
for my mind's aboard ship already.
DOR.
You'd better have gone to-morrow, and dined here to-day.
(SAGARISTIO is going.)
Farewell!
Tox.
Since that fellow's gone, I may say here whatever I please.
This day has assuredly shone a gainful one for you;
for you've not been buying her, but making a clear profit of her.
DOR.
He indeed quite understands what he has been about, in having sold me a stolen woman at my own risk;
lie has got the money, and taken himself off.
How do I know now whether she mayn't be claimed at once P Whither am I to follow him P To the Persians, nonsense.
Tox.
I imagined that my services would be a cause for thankfulness with you.
DOR.
Why, yes, indeed, I do return you thanks, Toxilus, for I found that you zealously gave me your assistance.
Tox.
What, I, to you PDOR.
In seriousness, yes.
By-the-bye, I forgot just now to give some directions in-doors, which I intended to be given Do keep watch on her.
(Pointing to the YOUNG WOMAN.)Tox.
She's all safe, for certain (DORDALUS goes into his house.)DAU.
My father's delaying now.
Tox.
What, if I put him in mind ?
DAU.
It's full time.
Tox. (going to the side of the stage, and calling aloud).
Hallo!
Saturio, come forward;
now's the opportunity for taking vengeance on the enemy.
SAG.
See, here I am.
Have I delayed at all?
Tox.
Well, go you off there at a distance out of sight;
keep siLence.
When you see me talking to the Procurer, do you then make a row.
SAT.
A word's enough to the wise.
(-Be withdraws out of sight.)DOR.
On coming into the house, I lashed them all with the whip;
my house and furniture are in such a dirty state.
Tox.
Are you returned at last ?
DOR.
I'm returned.
Tox.
Assuredly, I have this day done you many services.
DOR.
I confess it;
I give you thanks.
Tox.
Do you want anything else with me ?
DOR.
That happiness may attend you.
Tox.
I' faith, all that indeed I shall surely enjoy at home now;
for I shall now go take my place at table with your freed-woman.
You, when I'm goneDOR.
Why don't you hold your tongue ?
I know what it is you want.
(TOXILUS goes into the house.)SAT.
If I don't prove the destruction of that fellow—DOR.
I'm undone.
SAT.
And most luckily there he is, himself, before the door.
DAU.
(running towards him).
Most welcome, my dear father.
(She embraces him.)SAT.
Welcome, my child.
DOR. (aside).
That Persian has utterly ruined me!
DAU. (to DORDALUS).
This is my father.
DOR.
Ha!—what ?-father ?
I'm utterly undone!
Why then, in my misery, do I delay to bewail my sixty minæ ?
SAT.
By my faith, you scoundrel, I'll give you cause to bewail your own self as well.
DOR.
I'm undone!
SAT.
Come, walk before a magistrate, Procurer.
SAT.
I'll tell you there, before the Prætor.
But before the magistrate I summon you.
DOR.
Don't you summon!
a witness ?
SAT.
What, for your sake, hangdog, am I to be touching the ear of any being that's free—you, who are here trading in persons, free citizens ?
DOR.
Let me but speak— SAT.
I won't.
DOR.
Hear me.
SAT.
I'm deaf.
Walk on-follow me this way (dragging him), you villanous mouser after maidens!
Follow after me this way, my daughter, to the Prætor.
DAU.
I'll follow.
(Exit SATURIO, dragging DORDALUS, his DAUGHTERfollowing.)Tox. (to himself).
The foe subdued, the citizens safe, the state in tranquillity, peace fully ratified, the war finished, our affairs prospering, tne army and the garrisons untouched;
masmuch, Jupiter, and all you other Deities potent in the heavens, you have kindly aided us, for that reason do I return and give you thanks;
because I have been fully revenged upon my foe.
Now, for this reason, among my partners will I divide and allot the spoil.
(To the SLAVES in the house, who obey his orders.)
Come out of doors;
here, before the entrance and the door, I wish to entertain my commates with hospitality.
Lay down the couches here;
place here the things that are usual.
Here am I determined that my eagle!
shall be first pitched;
from which spot I'll cause all to become merry, joyous, and delighted, by the aid of whom those things which I wished to be effected have been ren­ dered for me easy to be done;
for worthless is the man who knows how to receive a kindness, and knows not how to return it.
LEM.
My Toxilus, why am.
I without you ?
And why are you without me ?
Tox.
Come then, my own one, approach me, and embrace me, please.
LEM.
Indeed I will.
(Embraces him.)Tox. 0, nothing is there more sweet than this.
But, there's a dear, apple of my eye, why don't we at once betake us to the couches ?
LEM.
Everything that you wish, the same do I desire.
Tox.
It's mutual.
Come, come-come then.
You, Saga­ ristio, recline in the upper place.
SAG.
I don't at all care for it.
Give me but equal shares in what I've earned.
Tox.
All in good time.
SAG.
For me that “ good time" is too late.
Tox.
Attend to the matter in hand.
Take your place;
this delightful day let's keep as a joyous birthday of mine.
(To the SLAVES.)
Bring water for our hands;
arrange the table.
(The SLAVES obey, and the GUESTS take their places.)
To you, blooming one (addressing LEMNISELENE), I give this blooming wreath.
(-Places a garland on her head.)
You shall be our governess here.
Come, lad, commence these games from the top with a round of seven cups.
Bestir your hands;
make haste.
Pægnium, you are slow in giving me the cups;
really, do give them.
Here's luck to me, luck to you, luck to my mistress, luck to us all.
This much wished-for day has been sent me by the Gods this day, inas­ much as I am allowed to embrace you a free woman.
(He drinks.)LEM.
By your own agency it was effected.
(Giving him the cup.)
This cup my hand presents to you, as it becomes a mistress to her love.
Tox.
Give it me.
LEM.
Take it.
( Gives him the cup.)Tox.
Here's luck to him who envies me, and to him who rejoices in this joy.
(Drinks.)DOR. (to himself).
Those who are, and those who shall be, and those who have been, and those who are to be here­ after, all of them I singly by far surpass, in being the most wretched of men alive.
I'm undone, ruined quite!
This day has shone upon me the most unfortunate of days;
that miner Toxilus has so outmanoeuvred me, and has so laid waste my property!
A whole cartload of silver, to my mis­ fortune, have I upset, and lost, and have not that for which I did upset it.
May all the Deities utterly confound that Persian, and all Persians, and all persons besides !
in such a way has Toxilus, the wretch, conjured this up against me.
Because I didn't trust him for the money, for that reason has he contrived this plan against me,—a fellow, that, by my faith, if I only live, I'll bring to torture and the fetters;
if, indeed, his master ever returns here, as I trust he will.
(Catching sight of the REVELLERS.)
But what is it I see ?
Do look at that.
What play is this ?
By my troth, they're carousing here surely.
I'll accost them.
(-He goes up to them.) 0 worthy sir (to TOXILUS), my greetings to you— you, too (to LEMNISELENE), my worthy freed-woman.
Tox.
Why surely this is Dordalus.
SAG.
Invite him, then, to come.
Tox. (to DORDALUS).
Come here, if you like.
(Aside.)
Come, let's sing his praises.
(Aloud.)
Dordalus, most de­ lightful fellow, welcome, here's a place for you;
take your place here (pointing to a couch).
Bring water for his feet (to the SLAVES.)
Are you going to give it, lad ?
(Is going to pat DORDALUS on the shoulder.)DOR.
Don't you, please, be touching me with a single finger, lest I should fell you to the ground, you villain.
PÆG. (holding up a cup).
And I this very instant will be striking out your eye with this tankard.
DOR.
What do you say, gallows1, you wearer-away of the whip?
How have you imposed upon me2 to-day?
Into what embarrassments have you thrown me ?
How have I been baulked about the Persian ?
Tox.
You'll be off with your abuse from here, if you are wise.
DOR. (to LEMNISELENE).
But, my worthy freed-woman, you knew of this, and concealed it from me.
LEM.
It's folly for a person who can enjoy himself to turn to brawling in preference.
'Twere more proper for you to arrange about those matters another time.
DOR.
My heart's in flames.
Tox.
Give him a goblet, then;
put out the fire, if his heart's in flames, that his head mayn't be burnt.
DOR.
You're making sport of me, I find.
Tox.
Would you likes a new playfellow for you, Pægnium ?
(Pointing at DORDALUS.)
But sport on as you are wont, as this is a place of freedom.
(PÆGNIUM struts about round DORDALUS.) 0 rare!
you do stalk in a princely style and right merrily.
PÆG.
It befits me to be merry, and I've a longing to play this Procurer some pranks, since he's deserving of it.
Tox.
As you commenced, proceed.
PÆG. (striking him).
Take that, Procurer!
DOR.
I'm undone!
he has almost knocked me down!
PÆG.
Hey—be on your guard4 again.
(Strikes at him.)DOR.
Sport on just as you please, while your master's away from here.
PÆG. (skipping around him).
Don't you see how obedient I am to your request ?
But why, on the other hand, are not you obedient to my request as well, and why don't you do that which I advise you ?
DOR.
What's that ?
PÆG.
Do you take a stout rope for yourself, and go hang yourself.
DOR.
(shaking his stick).
Take you care, will you, that you don't touch me, lest I give you a heavy return with this walking-stick.
PÆG.
Make use of it;
I give you leave.
Tox.
Come, come, Pægnium, put an end to it.
DOR.
By my faith, I'll utterly destroy you all.
Tox.
But he, who dwells above!
us, wishes you all ill, and will do you all ill.
It's not they that tell you so, but I.Tox.
Come (to the SLAVES), carry round the honied wine2;
give us drink in goblets quite full:
it's a long time now since we last drank;
we've been athirst too long.
DOR.
May the Gods grant that you may drink that which may never pass through you.
PÆG.
I cannot forbear, Procurer, from at least dancing a hornpipes for you, which Hegea formerly composed.
But just look if it quite pleases you.
(He dances.)SAG. (rising).
I'd like also to repeat that one which Dio­ dorus formerly composed in Ionia.
(Goes close to DOR­ DALUS.)DOR.
I'll be doing you a mischief, if you are not off!
SAG.
Still muttering, impudence ?
If you provoke me, I'll just now be bringing you the Persian again.
DOR.
I' faith, I'm silenced now.
Why, you are the Persian that has been fleecing me to the quick!
Tox.
Hold your tongue, simpleton;
this is his twin- brother.
DOR.
Is it he ?
Tox.
Aye, and a very twin of twins.
DOR.
May the Gods and Goddesses rack both yourself and your twin-brother.
SAG.
Him, you mean, who has been ruining you;
for I don't deserve anything.
DOR.
But still, what he deserves, I hope that that may prove to your undoing.
Tox. (to SAGARISTIO).
Come, if you like, let's have some sport with this fellow, unless he isn't deemed worthy of it.
SAG.
Just now it's right.
LEM. (aside).
But it isn't proper for me.
Tox. (aside).
For the reason, I suppose, that he made no difficulties when I purchased you.
LEM. (aside).
But stillTox. (aside).
No “ still."
Beware, then, of a mishap, will you, and obey me.
It becomes you to be heedful of my orders;
for, i' faith, had it not been for me and my protec­ tion, he would before long have made a street-walker of you.
But such are some of those who have gained their free­ dom, unless they thwart their patron, they don't appear to themselves free enough, or wise enough, or honest enough, unless they oppose him, unless they abuse him, unless they are found ungrateful to him who has been kind.
LEM. (aside).
I' troth, your kindnesses command me to pay obedience to your commands.
Tox. (aside).
I clearly am your patron, who paid the money for you to that man (pointing to DORDALUS) ;
in re­ turn for that, I choose that he shall be made sport of.
LEM. (aside).
For my part, I'll do my utmost.
DOR.
For sure, these persons are consulting to do some­ thing, I know not what, to injure me.
SAG.
Hark you.
Tox.
What do you say PSAG.
Is this person here, Dordalus the Procurer, who deals in free women?
Is this he who was formerly sc stalwart ?
DOR.
What means this ?
(PÆGNIUM strikes him.)
Oh, oh!
he has given me a slap in the face !
I'll do you a mis­ chief.
(Shakes his fist at him.)Tox.
But we have done you one, and shall do it again too.
DOR. (PÆGNIUM pinching him).
Oh, oh!
he's pinching my behind.
PÆG.
Of course;
it has been many a time twitched be­ fore this.
DOR.
Are you still prating, you bit of a boy ?LEM. (to DORDALUS).
My patron, do, there's a dear, come in-doors to dinner.
DOR.
My lump of laziness, are you now scoffing at me ?
LEM.
What, because I invite you to enjoy yourself ?
DOR.
I don't want to enjoy myself.
LEM, Then don't.
Tox.
How then?
The six hundred didrachms, how are they ?
What disturbances they do cause.
DOR. (aside).
I'm utterly undone!
They understand full well how to return the compliment to an enemy.
Tox.
Have we now had satisfaction enough ?
DOR.
I confess it;
I hold up my hands1 to you.
Tox.
And, ere long, you shall be holding them beneath the bilboes2.
Be off in-doors.
SAG.
To perdition!
DOR. (to the AUDIENCE).
Have these fellows here worked me in too slight a degree ?

Keep in mind that you met with a Toxilus.
( To the AUDIENCE.)
Spectators, kindly fare you well.
The Procurer is demolished.
Grant us your applause.
STALINO, an aged Athenian.
CHALINUS, the armour-bearer of Euthynicns, son of StalinoA COOK.
MALE SLAVES.
PARDALISCA, her maid-servant.
Two MAID-SERVANTS of Cleostrata..—Athens before the of STALINO and ALCESMUSA SERVANT, having obtained from a woman a female infant which was about to be exposed, brings it to his mistress, Cleostrata, who brings it up with the greatest care.
The child is called Casina;
and when she grows ulT, loth Sta­ lino, the husband, and Euthynicus, the son of Cleostrata, fall in love with her.
Cleostrata, being aware of this, and favouring the passion of Euthynicns, is desirous to give Casina in marriage to Chalinus, his armour-bearer, as a covert method of putting her in the power of Euthynicus.
On the other hand, Stalino wishes her to be married to Olympic, the bailiff of his farm, as a means of getting her into his own possession.
It is at last arranged that the matter shall be decided by lot, which being drawn, Olympic is the winner.
Cleostrata then resorts to a stratagem to defeat her husband's plan.
With the assistance of Myrrhina and her own female servants, she dresses up Chalinus represent Casina, who is taken by the bridegroom Olympic to a house in the vicinity, which has been secretly engaged by Stalino.
The Play concludes with Olympic and Stalino rushing out of the house in dismay, after having been soundly beaten by Chalinus.
Stalino implores pardon of his wife, which, at the inter­ cession of Myrrhina, is granted.
It is then discovered that Casina is really the daughter of Alcesimus, and the Audience is informed that she is tc to riven in marriage to Enthynicus.
Two fellow-servants seek their fellow-servant (Conservam) as a wife;
the old man prompts the one (Alium), his son the other.
A decision by lot (Sors) favours the old man;
but he is deceived by a stratagem;
and so (Ita) for him, in place of the damsel, a rascally (Nequam) servant is substituted, who thrashes his master and the bailiff.
The young man (Adolescens) marries Casina, when known to be a citizen.
I BID you, most worthy Spectators, welcome;
who most highly esteem the Goddess Faith2, and Faith esteems you.
If I have said the truth, then give me loud applause, that even now, from the very beginning forward, I may know that you are favourably disposed towards me.
Those who make use of aged wine, I deem to be wise;
and those as well, who, through choice, are the spectators of ancient Plays.
Since antique works and words are pleasing to you, 'tis just that ancient Plays should in preference please you;
for the new Comedies which come out now-a-days are much more worthless than the new-coined moneys.
We, since we have heard the report in public, that you ardently wish for the Playa of Plautus, have brought forward this ancient Comedy of his., which you, who are among the older ones, have formerly ap­ proved.
But I am aware that those who are among the younger ones are not acquainted with it;
still, that they may make ac­ quaintance with it, we will carefully use our best endeavours.
When this was first represented, it surpassed all other Plays.
In those days there was the very élite of the poets, who have now departed hence to the place common to all.
But though departed, yet do they prove of advantage to those who are still existing.
All of you, with the greatest earnestness, I would have entreated that you'll kindly lend attention to this our com­ pany.
Dismiss from your thoughts cares and monies due;
let no man stand in dread of his duns.
'Tis a holiday this­ to the bankers a holiday has been given.
'Tis now a calm ;
about the Forum these are Halcyon days1.
Reasonably do they act:
during the games2 they ask no manner money ;
but during the games to no one do they pay.
If your ears are disengaged, give me your attention;
I wish to mention to you the name of the Play. “ Clerumenæ3” this Comedy is called in Greek;
in Latin, “Sortientes."
Diphilus wrote it in Greek, and after that, over again, Plautus with the barking name4 in Latin afresh.
(Pointing to the house of STALlNO.)
An old married man is living here;
he has a son;
he, with his father, is dwelling in this house.
He has a certain slave, who with disease is confined—aye, faith, to his bed, he really is, that I may tell no lie.
But sixteen years ago, it happened that on a time this servant, at early dawn, beheld a female child being exposed.
He went at once to the woman who was exposing it, and begged her to give it to himself.
He gained his request:
he took it away, and carried it straight home.
He gave it to his mistress, and entreated her to take care of it, and bring it up.
His mistress did so;
with great care she brought it up, as though it had been her own daughter, not much different.
Since then she has grown up to that age to be able to prove an attraction to the men;
but this old gentleman loves this girl distractedly, and, on the other hand, so does his son as well.
Each of them now, on either side, is preparing his legions, both father and son, each unknown to the other.
The father has de­ puted his bailiff to ask her as his wife;
he hopes that, if she's given to him, an attraction out of doors will be, un­ known to his wife, provided for him.
But the son has de­ puted his armour-bearer to ask her for himself as a wife.
He knows that if he gains that request, there will be an object for him to love, within his abode.
The wife of the old gen­ tleman has found out that he is gratifying his amorousness;
for that reason, she is making common cause together with her son.
But this father, when he found out that his son was in love with this same woman, and was a hindrance to him, sent the young man hence upon business abroad.
His mo­ ther, understanding this, still lends him, though absent, her assistance.
Don't you expect it;
he will not, in this Play, to-day, return to the city.
Plautus did not choose it:
he broke down the bridge that lay before him in the way.
There are some here, who, I fancy, are now saying among themselves, " Prithee, what means this, i' faith ?-the mar­ riage of a slave1?
Are slaves to be marrying wives, or asking them for themselves ?
They've introduced something new­ a thing that's done nowhere in the world."
But I affirm that this is done in Greece1, and at Carthage, and here in our own country, and in the Apulian country;
and that the marriages of slaves are wont to be solemnized there with more fuss than even those of free persons.
If this is not the fact, if any one pleases, let him bet with me a stake towards a jug of honied wine2, so long as a Carthaginian is the umpire in my cause, or a Greek in fact, or an Apulian.
(A pause.)
What now ?
You don't take it ?
No one's thirsty, I find.
I'll return to that foundling girl, whom the two slaves are, with all their might, contending for as a wife.
She'll be found to be both chaste and free, of freeborn parents, an Athenian girl, and assuredly of no immodesty at all will she be guilty3 in this Comedy at least.
But i' faith, for sure, directly afterwards, when the Play is over, if any one offers the money, as I guess, she'll readily enter into matrimony with him, and not wait for good omens.
Thus much I have to say.
Farewell;
be prosperous in your affairs, and conquer by true valour, as hitherto you've done4.
OL.
Isn't it to be allowed me for myself to speak and think about my own affairs by myself, just as I choose, with­ out you as an overlooker ?
Why the plague are you fol­ lowing me about ?
CHA.
Because I'm resolved, just like your shadow, wher­ ever you go, to follow you about.
Why troth, even if you are ready to go to the cross, I'm determined to follow you.
Hence judge of the sequel, whether you can or not, by your arti­ fices, slily deprive me of Casina for a wife, just as you are attempting.
OL.
What business have you with me ?
CHA.
What say you, impudence ?
Why are you creeping about in the city, you bailing so very valuable in this place ?
OL.
Because I choose.
CHA.
But why ain't you in the country, at your post of command ?
Why don't you rather pay attention to the business that has been entrusted to you, and keep yourself from meddling in city matters ?
Have you come hither to deprive me of my betrothed ?
Be off to the country-be off to your place of command, and be hanged to you.
OL.
Chalinus, I have not forgotten my duty.
I've given charge to one who will still take care that alps right in the country.
When I've got that for which I came hither to the city, to take her as my wife whom you are dying for -the fair and charming Casina, your fellow-servant-when I've carried her off with myself into the country as my wife, I'll then stick fast in the country, at my post of command.
CHA.
What, you marry her P By my faith, 'twere better I should die by a halter, than that you should be the winner of her.
OL.
She's my prize;
do you put yourself in a halter at once.
CHA.
Fellow, dug up from your own dunghill, is she to be your prize ?
OL.
You'll find that such is the fact.
Woe be unto you!
in what a many ways, if I only live, I'll have you tormented at my wedding!
CIA.
What will you do to me ?
OL.
What will I do to you ?
In the first place of all, you shall hold the lighted torch for this new-made bride oj mine;
that always, in future, you may be worthless1, and not esteemed.
Then next after that, when you get to the country- house, a single pitcher2 shall be found you, and a single path, a single spring, a single brass cauldron, and eight casks;
and unless these shall be always kept filled, I'll load you with lashes.
I'll make you so thoroughly bent with carry­ ing water, that a horse's crupper might be manufactured out of you.
And then, in future, unless in the country you either feed on pulse, or, like a worm, upon the soil, should you require to taste of any better food, never, upon my faith, is hunger as full of hungriness as I'll make you to be in the country.
After that, when you're tired out, and starved with famine, care shall be taken that, at night, you go to bed as you deserve.
CHA.
What will you do ?
OL.
You shall be shut up fast in a nook with bars, where you can listen while I'm caressing her, while she is say­ ing to me, “ My soul, my own Olympic, my life, my sweet, my delight, do let me kiss your dear eyes, my love!
do, there's a dear, let yourself be loved!
my own day of happiness, my sparrow-chick, my own dove, my leveret!"
When these expressions shall be being uttered to me, then will you, you villain, be wriggling about like a mouse in the middle of the wall.
Now, that you mayn't be trying to give me an an­ swer, I'll off in-doors ;
I'm tired of your talk.
(Goes into the house of STALINO.)CHA.
I'll follow you.
Here, indeed, on my word, assu­ redly you shall do nothing without me for an overlooker.
(Follows him into the house.)CLE. (at the door, to the SERVANTS, within).
Seal fast the store-roomsl, bring back the signet to me.
I'm going here to my next door neighbour;
if my husband wants me for anything, take care and send for me thence.
PAR.
The old gentleman ordered a breakfast to be got ready for him to-day.
CLE.
Tut!
Hold your tongue, and be off.
(PARDALISCA goes into the house.)
I don't prepare it, and it shan't be cooked;
since he sets himself against myself and his son, for the sake of his passion and his appetite.
A disgraceful fellow that!
I'll punish this lover with hunger, I'll punish him with thirst, with abuse, with hardships.
By my faith, I'll tho­ roughly worry him with disagreable speeches;
I'll make him to pass a life in future just as he deserves—fit food for Acheron, a hunter after iniquity, a stable of infamy!
Now I'll away hence to my neighbours, to lament my lot.
But the door makes a noise;
and see, she's coming out of doors herself.
On my word, I've not started for my call at a convenient time.
MYRR. (to her SERVANTS, at the door).
Follow me, my attendants1, here next door.
You there!
Does any one hear this that I say ?
I shall be here, if my husband or any person shall seek me.
Did I order my distaff to be taken there ?
For when I'm at home alone, drowsiness takes effect upon2 my hand.
CLE.
Myrrhina, good morrow.
MYRR.
Good morrow, my dear Cleostrata.
But, prithee, why are you sad ?
CLE.
So all are wont to be who are unfortunately married;
at home and abroad, there's always enough to make them sad.
But I was going to your house.
MYRR.
And, troth, I was coming here to yours.
But what is it that now distresses your mind ?
For the thing that distresses you, that same is a trouble to me.
CLE.
On my word, I do believe you.
For with good reason no female neighbour of mine do I love better than yourself, nor any one with whom I have more ties of in­ timacy, to afford me pleasure.
MYRR.
I thank you kindly, and I long to know what this is.
CLE.
My husband has put slights upon me in a most unworthy manner.
MYRR.
Hah!
What is it ?
Prithee, repeat that same again ;
for, on my word, I don't in my mind sufficiently com­ prehend your complaints.
CLE.
My husband has put slights upon me in a most un­ worthy manner, and I have not the advantage of enjoying my own rights.
MYRR.
'Tis surprising, if you say the truth;
for husbands can scarce obtain from their wives what's their own right.
CLE.
Why, against my will, he demands a female servant of me, who belongs to myself, and was brought up at my own expense, for him to give to his bailiff.
But he is in love with her himself.
MYRR.
Pray, do hold your tongue.
CLE. (looking round).
But here we may speak at present;
we are aloneMYRR.
It is so.
But whence did you get her?
For a good wife ought to have no property unknown to her hus­ band ;
and she who has got any, it is not to her credit, for she must either have purloined it from her husband, or ob­ tained it by unfaithfulness.
Whatever is your own, all that I take to be your husband's.
CLE.
Surely, you're saying all this out of opposition to your friend.
MYRR.
Do hold your tongue, will you, simpleton, and at­ tend to me.
Do you forbear to oppose him, will you.
Let him love on;
that which he chooses let him do, so long as nothing's denied you at home.
CLE.
Are you quite in your senses ?
For really, you are saying these things against your own interest.
MYRR.
Silly creature, do you always take care and be on guard against this expression from your husband- CLE.
What expression?
MYRR. “ Woman!
out of doors with you1!”CLE. (in a low voice).
'St! be quiet.
MYRR.
What's the matter ?
CLE.
Hush!
(Looks in a particular direction.)MYRR.
Who is it that you see ?
CLE.
Why look, my husband's coming;
go you in-doors.
Make all haste;
be off, there's a dear.
MYRR.
You easily prevail;
I'm off.
CLE.
At a future time, when you and I shall have more .eisure, then I'll talk to you.
For the present, adieu!
MYRR.
Adieu!
(Goes into her house.
CLEOSTRATA stands aside.)STA. (to himself).
I do believe that love excels all things and delights that are exquisite.
It is not possible for anything to be mentioned, that has more relish and more that's deli­ cious in it.
Really, I do much wonder at the cooks, who employ sauces so many, that they don't employ this one seasoning, which excels them all.
For where love shall be the seasoning, that I do believe will please every one;
nor can there be anything relishing or sweet, where love is not mixed with it.
Act II.
The gall which is bitter, that same it will make into honey;
a man from morose into one cheerful and pleasant.
This conjecture do I form rather from myself at home than from anything I've heard;
who, since I've been in love with Casina, more than in my young days have excelled Neatness herself in neatness ;
I give employment to all the perfumers;
wherever an unguent is excellent, I perfume myself, that I may please her.
And I do please her, as I think.
But inasmuch as she keeps living on, my wife's a torment.
(Catches sight of his WIFE, and speaks in a low voice.)
I espy her standing there in gloominess.
This plaguy baggage must be addressed by me with civility.
(Going towards her.)
My own wife and mj delight, what are you about ?
(Takes hold of her.)CLE. (shaking him off).
Get you gone, and keep your hand off!
STA.
0 fie! my Juno.
You shouldn't be so cross to your own Jupiter.
Where art come now ?
CLE.
Let me alone.
(Moves as if going.)STA.
Do stay.
CLE. (still going).
I shan't stay.
STA.
I' troth, then I'll follow you.
(-Follows her.)CLE. (turning round).
Prithee, are you in your senses?
STA.
In my senses, inasmuch as I love von.CLE.
I don't want you to love me.
STA.
You can't have your way there.
CLE.
You plague me to death.
STA.
I only wish you spoke the truth.
CLE.
There I believe you.
(Moves on.)STA.
Do look back, 0 my sweet one.
CLE.
About as much, I suppose, as you are to me.
Whence is this strong smell of perfumes, prithee ?STA. (aside).
0 dear, I'm undone;
to my misfortune, I'm caught in the fact.
Why delay to rub it off my head with my cloak ?
(Rubs his head with his cloak.)
May good Mercury1 confound you, you perfumer, who provided me with this.
CLE.
How now, you worthless grey gnat2!
I can hardly restrain myself from saying what you deserve.
In your old age, good-for-nothing, are you walking along the streets reeking with perfumes ?
STA.
I' faith, I lent my company to a certain friend oj mine, while be was purchasing some perfumes.
CLE.
How readily he did trump that up.
Are you ashamed of anything ?
STA.
Of everything that you like.
CLE.
In what dens of iniquity have you been lying ?STA. (with an air of surprise).
I, in dens of iniquity?
CLE.
I know more than you think I do.
STA.
What is it that you know ?
CLE.
That not one among all the old men is more worth­ less anyourself, an old man.
Whence come you, good- for-nothing ?
Where have you been ?
In what den amusing yourself?
Where have you been drinking ?
You are come, on my word;
look at his cloak, how it's creased.
(Points at it.
)STA.
May the Gods confound both me and yourself, if I this day have put a drop of wine into my mouth.
CLE.
Very well then;
just as you like:
drink, eat, and squander away your property!
STA.
Hold, wife;
there's now enough of it;
you din me too much.
Do leave a little of your talk, that you may wrangle with me to-morrow.
But what say you?
Have you by this time subdued your temper, so as to do that in preference which your husband wishes to be done, rather than strive against him ?
CLE.
About what matter are you speaking ?
STA.
Do you ask me ?
About the handmaid Casina—that she may be given in marriage to our bailiff, an honest ser­ vant, where she'll be well off, in wood, warm water, food, and clothing, and where she may properly bring up the children which she may have, in preference to that rascally servant of an armour-bearerl, a good-for-nothing and dis­ honest, a fellow that hasn't this day a leaden dump of money his own.
CLE.
Upon my faith, I am surprised that in your old age you do not remember your duty.
STA.
How so ?
CLE.
Because if you were to act rightly or becomingly, you'd let me manage the maid-servants, which is my own province.
STA.
Why the plague do you wish to give her to a fellow that carries a shield ?
CLE.
Because it's our duty to gratify our only son.
STA..
But although he is an only one, not a bit the more is he my only son than I am his only father.
It's more becoming for him to conform to me, than for me to him.
CLE.
By my troth, sir, you're providing for yourself a serious piece of trouble.
STA. (aside).
She suspects it, I find that.
(To his wife.)
What, I, do you mean ?
CLE.
You;
but why do you stammer so ?
Why do you wish for this with such anxiety ?
STA.
Why, that she may rather be given to a servant that's honest, than to a servant that's dishonest.
CLE.
What if I prevail upon, and obtain of the bailiff, that for my sake he'll give her up to the other one ?
STA.
But what if I prevail upon the armour-bearer to give her up to the other one ?
And I think that I can prevail upon him in this.
CLE.
That's agreed upon.
Should you like that, in your name, I should call Chalinus hither out of doors ?
Do you beg of him, and I'll beg of the bailiff.
STA.
I'm quite willing.
CLE.
He'll be here just now.
Now we'll make trial which of us two is the most persuasive.
(She goes into the house.)STA. (to himself).
May Hercules and the Gods confound her!—a thing that now I'm at liberty to say.
I'm wretchedly distracted with love;
but she, as though on purpose, thwarts me.
My wife has some suspicion now of this that I'm plan­ ning ;
for that reason is she purposely lending her assistance to the armour-bearer.
STA. (aside, on seeing him).
May all the Gods and God­ desses confound him!
CHA.
(addressing him).
Your wife said that you were calling me.
STA.
Why yes, I did order you to be sent for.
CHA.
Tell me what you want.
STA.
In the first place, I want you to speak to me a with a more cheerful countenance.
CHA.
It would be folly for me to be morose toward you whose rule is the strongest.
STA.
Indeed!
I consider you to be an honest fellow.
CHA.
So I find.
But if you think so, why don't you give me my freedom ?
STA.
Why so I wish to do;
but it'a of no use for me to wish a thing to be done, unless you aid me with your actions.
CHA.
What you wish, I only wish myself to be acquainted with it.
STA.
Listen then;
I'll tell you.
I've promised to give Casina as a wife to our bailiff.
CHA.
But your wife and your son have promised her to me.
STA.
I know it;
but whether now would you prefer your­ self to be single and a free man, or, as a married man, to pass your lives, yourself and your children, in slavery ?
This choice is your own:
whichever condition of these two you prefer, take it.
CHA.
If I am free, I live at my own cost;
at present I live at yours.
As to Casina, I'm resolved to give way to no born man.
STA.
Go in-doors, and at once be quick and call my wife here, out of doors;
and bring hither together with you an urn1, with some water, and the lots.
CHA.
I'm quite agreable.
STA.
I' faith, in some way or other I'll now ward off this weapon of yours;
for if, as it is, I shall not be able to prevail by persuasion, at least I'll try it by lot.
There I shall take vengeance upon you and your abettors.
CHA.
Still, for all that the lot will fall to meSTA.
Aye, faith, for you to go to perdition with direful torments.
CHA.
She shall marry me, contrive what you will, in any way you please.
STA.
Won't you away hence from my sight ?
CHA.
Unwillingly you look upon me, still I shall live on.
(Goes into the house.)STA. (to himself).
Am I not a wretched man ?
Don't all things go quite contrary with me ?
I'm now afraid that my wife will prevail upon Olympic not to marry Casina.
If that's done, why look, it's all over with me in my old age!
If she does not prevail, there is still some tiny hope in the lots.
But if the lots fail me, I'll make a pillow of a sword, and lay me down upon it.
But see, most opportunely Olym­ pio's coming out of doors.
OL.
By my faith, all in an instant shut me up in a hot furnace, and parch me there for a hard-baked biscuit1, good mistress, before you shall gain that point of me which you desire.
STA. (apart).
I'm all right.
My hope's realized, accord­ ing as I hear his words.
OL. (at the door, to his MISTRESS, within).
But why do you frighten me about liberty?
Why, even though you should oppose it, and your SOIl as well, against your wills and in spite of you both, for a single penny2 I can become free.
STA. (stepping forward).
What's this ?
Who are you wrangling with, Olympic ?
OL.
With the same person that you always are.
STA.
What, with my wife ?
OL.
What wife are you speak­ ing of to me ?
Really you are a hunter, as it were:
your nights and days you pass with a female cur3.
STA.
What does she say?
What's she talking to you about ?
OL.
She's begging and entreating of me that I won't be taking Casina as my wife.
STA.
What did you say after that ?
OLi.
Why, I declared that I wouldn't give way to Jupiter himself, if he were to entreat me.
STA.
May the Gods preserve you for me!
OL.
She's now all in a ferment;
she's swelling so against me.
STA.
By my troth, I could like her to burst in the middle.
OL.
I’ faith, I fancy she will, if indeed you manage cle­ verly.
But your amorousness, i' faith, is a cause of trouble to me;
your wife is at enmity with me, your son at enmity, my fellow-servants at enmity.
STA.
What matters that to you?
So long as (pointing to himself) this Jupiter only is propitious to you, do you take care and esteem the lesser Gods at a straw's value.
OL.
That's great nonsense;
as if you didn't know how suddenly your human Jupiters take to dying.
So after all, if you, my Jupiter, are dead and gone, when your realm devolves upon the lesser Gods, who shall then come to the rescue of my back, or head, or legs ?
STA.
Affairs will go with you better than you expect, if I obtain this-the enjoyment of my Casina.
OL.
I' faith, I do not think it possibly can be;
so earnestly is your wife striving that she shall not be given to me.
STA.
But this way I'll proceed:
I'll put the lots in an urn, and draw the lots for yourself and Chalinus.
I find that the business has come to this pass;
it's necessary to fight with swords hand to hand.
OL.
What, if the lot should turn out different from what you wish ?
STA.
Speak with good omen.
I rely upon the Gods;
we'll trust in the Gods.
OL.
That expression I wouldn't purchase at a rotten thread, for all people are relying upon the Gods;
but still I've frequently seen many of those deceived who relied upon the Gods.
STA.
But hold your tongue a little while.
(Pointing.)OL.
What is it you mean ?
STA.
Why look;
here's Chalinus coming from the house, out here, with the urn and the lots.
Now, with standards closing, we shall fight.
CLE.
Let me know, Chalinus, what my husband wants with me.
CHA.
By my troth, he wants to see you burn­ in,, outside of the Metian gate1.
CLE.
I' faith, I believe he does want that.
CHA..
But, by my troth, I don't believe it, but I know it for certain.
STA. (aside to OLYMPIO).
I've got more men of business than I imagined:
I've got this fellow, a Diviner, in my house.
What, if we move our standards nearer, and go to meet them ?
Follow me.
(Goes up to CLEOSTRATA and CHA­ LINUS.)
What are you about ?
CHA.
All the things are here which you ordered;
your wife, the lots, the urn, and myself.
STA.
By yourself only, there is more here than I want.
CHA.
I' faith, so it seems to you indeed.
I'm a stinger to you now;
I'm pricking that dear little heart of yours;
even now it's palpitating from alarm.
STA.
Whip-knave—— CLE.
Hold your tongue, Chalinus.
OL.
Do make that fellow be quiet.
CHA.
No, that fellow rather (pointing to OLYMPIO), who has learned to misbehavedSTA. (to CHALINUS).
Set the urn down here.
(CHALINUS puts it down.)
Give me the lots:
lend your attention now.
But I did think, my wife, that I could have prevailed upon you thus far, for Casina to be given me as my wife, and even now I think so.
CLE.
She, given to you ?
STA.
Why yes, to medear me, I didn't mean to say that.
While I meant for myself3, I said him;
(aside) why really, while I'm wanting her for myself, I've already, i' faith, been chattering at random.
CLE. (overhearing him).
Upon my word, you really have;
and you are still doing so.
STA.
For him—no, no;
for myself, i' faith4.
Plague take it, at last, with great difficulty, I've got into the right road!
CLE.
Very often, i' faith, you are making your mistakes.
STA.
Such is the case when you desire anything very much.
But each of us, both he (pointing to OLYMPIO) and I, apply to you for our rightsCLE.
How's that ?
STA.
Why, I'll tell you, my sweet.
As to this Casina, you must make a present of her to this jailiff of ours.
CLE.
But, i' faith, I neither do make it, nor do I in tend it.
STA.
In that case, then, I'll divide the lots between them.
CLE.
Who forbids you?
STA.
I judge with reason that that is the best and fairest way.
In fine, if that happens which we desire, we shall be glad;
but if otherwise, we'll bear it with equanimity.
( Giving a lot to OLYMPIO.)
Take this lot—take it;
see what's written on it.
OL. (looking at it).
Number one.
CHA.
It isn't fair, be­ cause that fellow has got one before me.
STA. (giving one to CHALINUS).
Take this, will you.
CHA. (taking it).
Give it me.
Stop though;
one thing has just now come into my mind.
(To CLEOSTRATA.)
Do you see that there's no other lot in there by chance at the bottom of the water.
STA.
Whip-rascal!
do you take me to be your own self?
(To CLEOSTRATA.)
There is none;
only set your feelings at rest.OL. (to CHALINUS).
May it prove lucky and fortunate to me, a great mischance to you!
CHA.
I' faith, it will certainly fall to you, I fancy;
I know your pious ways.
But stop a bit;
is that lot of yours of poplar or of fir ?
OL.
Why do you trouble yourself about that ?
CHA.
Why, because I'm afraid that it may float on the surface of the water.
(They go up to the urn.)STA.
Capital!-take care!
Now then, both of you, throw your lots in here.
(Pointing to the urn.)
Look now, wife, all's fair.
(They throw them in.)OL.
Don't you trust your wife,OL.
Upon my faith, I do believe that she'll lay a speL upon the lots this very day, if she touches them.
OL.
I'll hold my tongue.
I pray the GodsCHA.
Aye, that this day you may have to endure the chain1 and the bilboes2.
OL.
That the lot may fall to me.
CHA.
Aye, faith, that you may hang up by the feet.
OL.
Aye, that you may blow your eyes out of your head through your nose.
CHA. (to STALINO).
What are you afraid of?
It must be ready by this(Turning to OLYMPIO.)
A halter for you, I mean.
OL. (to CHALINUS).
You're undone !
STA.
Give attention, both of you.
OL.
I'll be mum.
STA.
Now you, Cleostrata, that you may not say that any­ thing has been done cheatingly by me in this matter, or sus­ pect it, I give you leave, do you yourself draw the lots.
Or. (to STALINO).
You are ruining me.
CHA.
He's gaining an advantage rather.
CLE. (to STALINO).
You do what's fair.
CHA. (to OLYMPIO).
I pray the Gods that your lot nay run away out of the urn.
OL.
Say you so ?
Because you are a runaway yourself, do you wish all to follow your example ?
I wish, indeed, that that lot of yours, as they say that of the descendants of Her­ cules3 once did, may melt away while the lots are drawing.
CHA.
And you, that you may melt away yourself, and just now be made hot with twigs.
STA.
Attend, will you, to the business in hand, Olympic!OL.
Yes, if this thrice-dotted1 fellow '11 let me.
STA.
May this prove lucky and fortunate to me.
OL.
Yes indeed;
to me as well..
CHA.
Not so.
OL.
By my troth, yes, I say.
CHA.
By my troth, yes, for myself, I say.STA. (to OLYMPIO).
He'll be the winner;
you'll live in wretchedness.
Do you give him a punch in the face this instant!
Well, what are you about ?CLE. (to OLYMPIO).
Don't you raise your hand.
Or. (to STALINO).
With clenched or open hand am I to strike him ?
STA.
Do just as you please.
OL. (striking CHALINUS).
There's for you, take that!
CLE. (to OLYMPIO).
What business have you to touch him ?
OL.
Because my Jupiter (pointing to STALINO) commanded me.
CLE. (to CHALINUS).
Do you slap him in the face in return.
(CHALINUS strikes OLYMPIC in the face.)OL. (calling out to STALINO).
I'm being murdered, I'm being punched with his fists, Jupiter!STA. (to CHALINUS).
What business had you to touch him ?
CHA.
Because this Juno of mine (pointing to CLEOSTRATA) ordered me.
STA.
I must put up with it, since, as long as I live, my wife will have the mastery.
CLE. (to STALINO).
He (pointing to CHALINUS) ought to oe allowed to speak as much as that fellow.
OL.
Why by his talk does he occasion me an unlucky omen1.
STA.
I think, Chalinus, you should be on your guard against a mishap.
CHA.
Full time, after my face has been battered!
STA.
Come, wife, now then draw the lots.
(To the SER­ VANTS.)
Do you give your attention.
(To CLEOSTRATA.)
And give it, you, as well.
OL.
Where I am I know not.
I'm undone, I've got my heart full of maggots, I think;
it's jumping about already;
with its throbbing it beats against my breast.
CLE. (putting her hand into the urn).
I've got hold of a lot.
STA.
Draw it out, then.
CHA. (to OLYMPIO).
Are you not dead now ?
OL.
Show it.
(She shows it.)
It's mine.
CHA.
Really this is an unlucky mishap.
CLE.
You are beaten, Chalinus.
STA.
Then I'm glad that we are to survive after all, Olympic.
OL.
Through my own piety and that of my forefathers has it happened.
STA.
Wife, go in-doors and make ready for the wedding.
CLE.
I'll do as you bid me.
STA.
Do you know that it's to a distance in the country, at the farm-house, that he is to take her ?
CLE.
I know.
STA.
Go in-doors, and although this is disagreable to you, still take care and attend to it.
CLE.
Very well.
(Goes into the house.)STA. (to OLYMPIO).
Let us, as well, go in-doors;
let's en­ treat them to make all haste.
OL.
Am I delaying at all ?
For in his presence (pointing to CHALINUS) I don't want there to be any further conversa­ tion.
(They go into the house.)CHA. (to himself).
If now I were to hang myself, I should be losing my pains, and besides my pains, putting myself to the expense of purchasing a rope, and doing a plea­ sure to my evil-wishers.
What need is there for me, who, indeed, am dead even as it is ?
At the lots I'm beaten;
Casina's to be married to the bailiff.
And this now is not so much to be regretted, that the bailiff has got the better, as the fact that the old man so vehemently desired that she shouldn't be given me, and should marry him.
How frightened he was, how in his misery he did bustle about, how he did caper about after the bailiff had won.
By-the- bye, I'll step aside here;
I hear the door opening.
(Sees STALING and OLYMPIO, coming out.)
My well-wishers and friends1 are coming out.
Here in ambush I'll lay in wait against them.
(Goes on one side.)OL.
Only let him come into the country;
I'll send the fellow back into the city to you with his porter's knot2, as black as a collier.
OL.
I'll have that done and well taken care of.
STA.
I intended, if he had been at home, to send Chalinu3 to cater with you;
that, even in his sadness, I might, in addition, inflict this misfortune upon our foe.
CHA. (apart, retreating to the wall of the house).
I'll betake me back again to the wall;
I'll imitate the crab.
Their con­ versation must be secretly picked up by me;
for the one of them is tormenting me, the other wasting me with anguish.
Why, this whip-rascal is marching along in his white garb3, a very receptacle for stripes.
My own death I defer;
I'm determined to send this fellow to Acheron before me.
OL.
How obsequious have I been found to you!
A thing that you especially desired, that same have I put in your power;
this day the object that you love shall be with you, unknown to your wife.
STA.
Hush!
So may the Deities kindly bless me, I can hardly withhold my lips from kissing you on account of this, my own delight!
CHA. (apart).
What?
Kiss him What's the meaning of this ?
What's this delight of yours ?
OL.
Do you love me at all now ?
STA.
Aye, by my faith, myself even less than you.
May I embrace you ?
OL.
You may.
(STALINO embraces him.)STA.
How, when I touch you, I do seem to myself to be tasting honey!
CHA. (apart).
I really do think he intends to choke the jailinf.
OL. (pushing STALING away).
Away with you, you lover;
get off, with your too close acquaintanceship!
CHA. (apart).
I' faith, I think that1 this very day they'll be making terms.
Surely, this old fellow is an universal admirer.
This is the reason, this is it why he made him his bailiff;
some time ago, too, when I came in his way, he wanted to make me his chamberlain upon the like terms.
OL.
How subservient have I proved to you to-day, how attentive to your pleasure!
STA.
How surely, so long as I live, will I prove more of a well-wisher to you than to my own self!
How will I this day give full many a kiss to Casina!
How will I, unknown to my wife, right pleasantly enjoy myself!
CHAL. (apart).
Oho!
Now, faith, at last I've got into the right track.
It's himself that's dying for Casina.
I've caught the fellows.
STA.
Even now, by my troth, am I longing to embrace her;
even now to be kissing her.
OL.
Do let her be brought out first from the house.
Why the plague are you in such a hurry ?
OL.
But I don't think that this can possibly be managed to-day.
STA.
It can, if, indeed, you think that you can possibly receive your freedom to-morrow.
CHA. (apart).
Why, really, I must make still better use here of my ears;
now, in one thicket, I shall be cleverly catching two boars.
STA. (pointing to the house of ALCESIMUS).
At the house of this friend and neighbour of mine there's a place pro­ vided ;
I have confided to him all my amorousness:
he said that he would find me a room.
OL.
What will his wife do ?
Where will she be ?STA.
I've cleverly contrived that:
my wife will invite her here, to her own house, to the wedding;
to be here with her, to help her, to sleep with her.
I have requested it, and my wife has said that she will do so.
She'll be sleeping here:
I'll take care her husband is away from home.
You shall take your wife home into the country;
that country shall be this house, for a period, until I've had my marriage with Casina.
Hence, before daylight, you shall afterwards take her home to-morrow.
Isn't it very skilfully managed ?CHA. (apart).
Only do proceed;
contrive away.
By my troth, to your own mischance are you so clever.
STA.
Do you know what you must do now ?
OL.
Tell me.
STA. (giving him a purse).
Take this purse.
Be off and buy some provisions:
make haste.
But I want it nicely done:
delicate eatables, just as she herself is a delicate bit.
OIL.
Very well.
STA.
Buy some cuttle-fish, mussels, calamaries, barley-fish1.
CHA. (apart).
Aye, wheaten fish, if you know what you're about.
STA.
Some sole-fish2.
CHA. (apart).
Prithee, why those rather than soles of wood, with which your head may be banged, you most vile old fellow?
OL.
Should you like some tongue-fish3 ?
STA.
What need is there, since my wife's at home ?
She is our tongue-fish, for she's never silent.
OL.
While I'm about it, I must make choice out of the supply of fish what to purchase.
STA.
You say what's good:
be off.
I don't care to spare for cost;
provide abundantly.
But it's requisite also that I should see this neighbour of mine, that he may attend to what I've requested.
OL.
Am I to go now ?
STA.
I wish you.
(Exit OLYM PIO.
STALING goes into the house of ALCESIMUS.)CHAL. (coming forward).
By three freedoms I could not be induced this day to do other than provide a heavy re­ tribution for them, and at once disclose all this matter to my mistress.
I've caught and fully detected my enemies in their guilt.
But if my mistress is ready now to do her duty, the cause is all our own:
I'll cleverly be beforehand with the fellows.
With omens in our favour the day pro­ ceeds:
just conquered, we are the conquerors.
I'll go in- doors, that that which another cook has seasoned, I now, in my turn, may season after another fashion;
and that for him for whom it was prepared, it may really not be pre­ pared ;
and that that may be prepared for him, which before was not prepared1.
(Goes into the house.)STA.
Now, AJcesimus, I shall know whether you are the very picture of friend or foe to me;
now is the proof upon, view;
now is the contest going on. " But why do I do so;
" forbear to correct me;
save yourself all that. " With your hoary head, at an age unfit;
" save yourself that as wet. "
One who has a wife;
" save yourself that likewise.
ALC.
I never saw a person more distracted with love than yourself.
STA.
Do take care that the house is clear.
ALO.
Why, faith, men-servants, maid-servants, all of them I'm determined to send out of the house to yours.
STA.
Heyday!
with your adroitness you are very adroit!
But only take care and remember the lines which Colax repeats1 ;
take care that every one comes with his own pro­ visions, as if they were going to Sutrium2.
ALC.
I'll remember it.
STA.
Why now there's no public ordinances better ordered than yourself, in fact.
Attend to this.
I'm now going to the Forum;
I shall be here just now.
ALC.
Luck go with you.
STA.
Take care that your house gets a tongue.
ALC.
Why so ?
STA.
That when I come, it may invite me.
ALC.
Pooh, pooh!
you are a person that stands in good need of a basting;
you're making too free with your fun.
STA.
Of what use is it for me to be in love, unless I'm quite ready and talkative ?
But take you care that you haven't to be sought for by me.
ALC.
I'll be at home all the while.
(-Exit STALING;
AL­ CESIMUS goes into his house.)CLE. (to herself).
This was the reason, then, i' faith, why my husband entreated me, with such great earnestness, to make haste and invite my female neighbour to our house­ that the house might be clear for him to be taking Casina there.
Now, therefore, I shall by no means invite her, so that liberty of free range shan't be any way given to worn-out bell-wethers.
(ALCESIMUS is coming out of his house.)
But look, the pillar of the Senate's coming forward, the safeguard of the public, my neighbour, the person who is finding free range for my husband.
I' faith, the measure of wit4 that has been sold to him, was purchased at no cheap rate.
ALC. (to himself).
I'm wondering that my wife, who'a already waiting at home, dressed out, to be sent for, hasn't been invited by this to my neighbour's here.
But see, here she is;
she's come to fetch her, I guess.
(Going up to CLEO­ STRATA.)
Good day, Cleostrata!
CLE.
And you the same, Alcesimus.
Where's your wife ?
ALC.
She's waiting in-doors for you to send for her;
for your husband requested me to send her to help you.
Do you wish me to call her ?
(Going towards the door.)CLE.
Let it alone;
I don't care;
* * if she's busy.
ALC.
She's at leisure.
CLE.
I don't care about it;
I don't want to be trouble­ some to her;
I'11 see her at a future time..
ALC.
Are you not getting ready for a wedding there at your house ?
CLE.
I am getting ready and making preparations.
ALC.
Don't you require an assistant then ?
CLE.
We have enough at home.
When the marriage has taken place, then I'll call upon her;
for the present, fare­ well, and bid her the same from me.
(Goes into her house.)ALC. (to himself).
What am I to do now?
To my sorrow Itve done a most disgraceful action for the sake of that vile and toothless goat, who has engaged me in this.
I've pro­ mised the aid of my wife out of doors, as though to go lick dishes1 like a dog.
A worthless fellow, to tell me that his wife was going to send for her, whereas she herself declares that she does not want her.
And upon my faith, it's a wonder if this female neighbour of mine hasn't already her suspicions of this.
But yet, on the other hand, when I reflect with myself on this notion, if there were anything of that, there would have been enquiries of me.
I'll go in-doors, that I may lay up the ship:
!
again in the dockyard.
(Goes into his house.)CLE. (to herself).
Now he has been finely made a fool oi.
In what a bustle are these unfortunate old fellows.
Now 1 do wish that that good-for-nothing decrepit husband of mine would come, that I might make a fool of him in his turn, after I have thus fooled the other one.
For I long to make a bit of a quarrel between these two.
But look, he's coming.
Why, when you see him so serious, you'd think him a decent person.
(She stands on one side, unseen.)STA. (aloud, to himself).
It's a great folly, to my notion at least, for any man that's in love to go to the Forum on that day on which the object which he loves is close at hand1;
as I in my folly have been doing;
I've spent the day, standing pleading2 for a certain relative of mine, who, faith, I'm very delighted has lost his cause;
so that he hasn't for nothing chosen me as his advocate to-day.
He ought first to ask and make enquiry, whether his mind is at home or not at home, whom he's choosing for his advocate;
if he says it isn't, without his mind he should send him off home.
(Catches sight of his wife.)
But look, there's my wife before the house!
Alas!
wretch that I am!
I'm afraid that she isn't deaf, and has heard this.
CLE. (apart).
By my troth, I have heard it to your great cost.
STA.
I'll go nearer to her.
(Goes up to CLEOSTRATA.)
What are you about, my delight ?
CLE.
I' faith, I was waiting for you.
STA.
Are the things ready now ?
Have you by this brought over here to our house this female neighbour of yours, who was to assist you ?
CLE.
I sent for her as you requested me;
but this com­ panion of yours, your very good friend, was in a pet with his wife about something, I don't know what;
he said, when I went to fetch her, that he wouldn't send her.
STA.
That's your greatest fault;
you are not courteous enough.
CLE.
It's not the part of matrons, but of harlots, to be showing courtesies, my husband, to the husbands of others.
Go yourself and fetch her;
I wish to attend in-doors, my husband, to what is requisite to be done.
STA.
Make haste then.
CLE.
Very well.
(Aside.)
Now, faith, I shall inspire some apprehensions in his heart.
I'll this day render this love­ sick man completely miserable.
(She goes into the house.)ALC. (to himself).
I'll go see here if the lover has come back home from the Forum, who, an old ghost, has been making fools of myself and my wife.
But see, there he is before his house.
(Addressing STALINO.)
I' faith, 'twas just in good time I was coming to your house.
STA.
And, i' faith, I to yours.
How say you, you good- for-nothing fellow ?
What did I enjoin you ?
What did I beg of you ?
ALC.
What's the matter ?
STA.
How nicely you've had your house empty for me!
How well you have sent your wife over to our house here!
Isn't it through yourself that I and the opportunity are lost, both of us ?
ALC.
Why don't you go hang yourself ?
Why, 'twas you yourself said that your wife would come and fetch mine from our house ?
STA.
Then she declares that she has been to fetch her, and that you said you wouldn't let her go.
ALC.
But she herself, of her own accord, said to me that she didn't care for her assistance.
STA.
But 'tis she1 herself who has deputed me to come and fetch her.
ALC.
But I don't care for that.
STA.
But you are proving my ruin.
ALC.
But that's as it should be.
But I shall still go on delaying;
but I very much long for nothing but to do you some mischief;
but I'll do it with pleasure.
Never this day shall you have a " but" the more than I.
But, in fine, really, upon my faith, may the Gods confound you.
STA.
What now ?
Are you going to send your wife to my house ?
ALC.
You may take her, and be off to utter and extreme perdition, both with her and with that one of yours, and with that mistress of yours as well.
Away with you, and attend to something else;
I'll at once bid my wife to pass thither through the garden to your wife.
STA.
Now you are proving yourself a friend to me in genuine style!
(ALCESIMUS goes into his house.)
Under what auspices am I to say that this passion was inflicted upon me, or what have I ever done amiss towards Venus, that when I'm thus in love crosses so many should befall me in my path?
(A noise is heard.)
Heyday!
what's that noise, prithee, that's going on in our house PPAR.
(bawling out at the door).
I'm undone, I'm undone, I'm utterly, utterly ruined!
My heart is deadened with fear.
My limbs, in my misery, are all a-trembling!
I know not whence to obtain or look for any assistance, safety, or refuge for my­ self, or any means of .relief:
things so surprising, in a manner so surprisingly done, have I just now witnessed in-doors, a new and unusual piece of audacity.
Be on your guard, Cleostrata!
prithee do get away from her, lest amid such transports she may be doing you some mischief!
Tear away that sword from her, who's not in possession of her senses!
STA.
Why, what is the matter-that she, frightened and half dead with fear, rushes hither out of doors ?
Pardalisca!PAR.
(looking wildly about her).
Whence do my ears catch the sound?
STA.
Just look back at me.
PAR.
I'm undone, and you are undone.
STA.
Disclose it, what's the matter with you ?
STA.
Aye, and the same to yourself.
PAR.
That I mayn't fall down, prithee do hold, hold me.
(Staggers, on which STALING supports her.)STA.
Whatever it is, tell me quickly.
PAR.
Do support my throbbing breast, prithee do make a little air with your cloak.
STA.
(fanning her with the lappet ofhis cloak) I'm in alarm as to what is the matter;
(aside) unless this woman has been somewhere upsetting herself with the pure cream1 of Bacchus.
PAR.
Hold my ears, pray do.
(Her head falls on her shoulder.)STA.
Away to utter perdition;
breast, ears, head, and your­ self, may the Gods confound!
For, unless I quickly learn from you this matter, whatever it is, I'll forthwith be knock­ ing your brains out, you viper, you hussey, who have thus far been making a laughing-stock of me.
PAR.
You are too angry.
STA.
You are saying so too soon.
But whatever this is, tell it;
relate in a few words what has been the disturbance in-doors.
PAR.
You shall know.
Hear this most foul crime which just now in-doors at our house your female slave began to at­ tempt after this fashion, a thing that does not befit the regu­ lations of Attica.
STA.
What is it ?
PAR.
Fever prevents the use of my tongue.
STA.
What is it ?
Can I possibly learn from you what is the matter ?
PAR.
I'll tell you.
Your female slave, she whom you in­ tend to give as a wife to your bailiff, in-doors sheSTA.
In-doors what ?
What is it ?
PAR.
Is imitating the wicked practices of wicked women, in threatening her husbandSTA.
What is it ?
PAR.
She says that she intends to take her husband's life.
A swordSTA.
What about that sword ?
PAR.
She has got one.
STA.
Ah!
wretch that I am!
Why has she got it ?
PAR.
She is pursuing them all at home all over the house, and she won't allow any person to approach her;
and so, all, hiding in chests and under beds, are mute with fear.
STA.
I'm murdered and ruined outright!
What malady is this that has so suddenly befallen her ?
PAR.
She is mad.
STA.
I do think that I am the most unfortunate of men !
PAR.
Aye, and if you were to know the speeches she uttered to-day.
STA.
I long to know about what she said.
PAR.
Listen.
By all the Gods and Goddesses she swore that she would murder the person with whom she should bed.
STA.
Will she murder me ?
PAR.
Does that bear reference to yourself in any way ?
STA.
Pshaw!
PAR.
What business have you with her ?
STA.
I made a mistake;
him, the bailiff, I meant to say.
PAR.
It's on purpose1 that you are turning aside from the high road into bye-paths.
STA.
Does she threaten anything against myself?
PAR.
She is hostile to you individually more than any person.
PAR.
Because you have given her as a wife to Olympic;
she says that she'll neither suffer your life, nor her own, nor that of her husband, to be prolonged until the morrow.
I have been sent hither to tell you this, that you might beware of her.
STA. (aside).
By my troth, to my misery I'm quite undone!
There neither is nor ever was any old man in love so wretched as I.PAR. (aside, to the AUDIENCE).
Don't I play him off cleverly?
For everything that I've been telling him as taking place, I've been telling him falsely.
My mistress and she who lives next door have concocted this scheme.
I've been sent to fool him.
STA.
There is something that I want to enquire of you about.
PAR.
You are causing me delay.
STA.
Why, you are causing me sorrow.
But has Casina got that sword even still ?
PAR.
She has;
but two of them.
STA.
Why two ?
PAR.
She says that this very day she'll murder you with the one, the bailiff with the other.
STA.
I am now the most utterly murdered of all people that do exist.
I'll put on me a coat of mail;
I think that's the best.
What did my wife do ?
Didn't she go and take them away from her ?.
PAR.
No person dares go near her.
STA.
She should have prevailed on her.
PAR.
She is entreating her.
She declares that assuredly she will lay them down on no other terms, unless she under­ stands that she shall not be given to the bailiff.
STA.
But whether she likes it or no, because she refuses, she shall marry him this day.
For why shouldn't I carry this out that I've begun, for her to marry me ?-that, in­ deed, I didn't intend to say—but, our bailiff?
PAR.
You're making your mistakes pretty often.
STA.
It's alarm that impedes my words.
But, prithee, do tell my wife, that I entreat her to prevail upon her to put down the sword, and allow me to return in-doors.
PAR.
I'll tell her.
STA.
And do you entreat her.
PAR.
And I'll entreat her.
STA.
And in soft language, in your usual way.
But do you hear me ?
If you manage this, I'll give you a pair of shoes1 and a gold ring2 for your finger, and plenty of nice things.
PAR.
I'll do my best.
STA.
Take care and prevail.
PAR.
Now then I'll be off;
unless you detain me for anything.
STA.
Be off, and take care.
PAR. (aside).
Look, his assistant is returning, at last, with the provisions;
he's bringing a train after him.
(She goes into the house.)OIL. (to the COOK).
See, you thief, that you lead on your briars beneath their banners1.
COOK.
But how are they briars POIL.
Because that which they have touched, they instantly seize hold of;
if you go to snatch it from them, they instantly rend it;
so, wherever they come, wherever they are, with a twofold loss2 do they mulct their masters.
COOK.
Heyday, indeed !
OL.
Well, well!
This way I'm delaying to go meet my master with a magnificent, patrician, and patronizing air.
(He struts along.)STA.
My good man, save you.
OL.
I admit that so I ans.
OL.
You are in love, but I'm hungering and thirsting.
STA.
You have come capitally provided.
OL.
Pooh!
pooh !
(Goes towards the door.)STA.
But stop you, although you do hold me in con­ temptOL.
0 dear, 0 dear!
your converse has a bad smell to me.
(Moving away.)STA.
What's the matter?
OL. (pointing to the baskets qf provisions).
That's the matter.
STA.
Will you not stop there POL.
Why, really, you are causing me ennui4.
STA.
I shall be giving you a grand coup1, I fancy, if you don't stand still forthwith.
(Catches hold of him.)OL. 0 mon Dieu2!
Can't you get away from me, unless you would like me to be sick just now ?
OL.
How's this ?
(Staring at him.)
What person's this ?
OL.
I, a slave ?
STA.
Aye, and mine.
OL.
Am I not a free man?
Remember!
remember!
STA.
Stop and stay you there!
(Catches hold of him.
OL.
That's very good.
STA.
My dear little Olympic, my father, my patron, I do beg of youOL.
Well, you certainly are in your senses.
OL.
What need have I of so worthless a slave ?
STA.
Well now, how soon are you going to provide me some amusement3 ?
OL.
If the dinner were but drest.
STA.
Then let them be off this instant in-doors.
(To the COOK and his ASSISTANTS.)
Go you into the house and despatch with all haste.
I'll come in just now.
Have the dinner charmingly sauced up4 for me;
I want to have a charming meal.
I really don't care, now, to be eating in the style of your sumptuous foreigners5.
Be off, will you;
but for the present, however, I take up my abode here.
(The COOK and his ASSISTANTS go into the house.)OL.
Is there anything that detains you here?
STA.
The servant-maid says that Casina has got a sword in-doors, to deprive you and me of life with it.
OL.
I understand it.
Just let her alone with it.
They are imposing on you:
I know these worthless baggages.
How­ ever, do you now go into the house with me.
STA.
But, i' faith, I'm fearful of mischief:
only do you go.
Reconnoitre, first, what's going on within.
OL.
My life's as dear to me as yours is to you.
STA.
But only do go now.
OL.
If you'll go yourself, I'll go in with you.
(They go into the house.)PAR. (to herself).
Upon my faith, I do not believe that at Nemea1, nordoIthink that at Olympia, or anywhere else, there ever where such funny games as these ridiculous games that are going on in-doors here with our old gentleman and our bailiff Olympic.
In-doors, all over the house, all are in a bustle;
the old man is bawling away in the kitchen, and urging on the cooks. "
Why don't you go to work at once ?
Why don't you serve up, if you are going to serve up ?
Make haste;
the dinner ought to have been cooked by this."
And then this bailiff is strutting about with his chaplet2, clothed in white and finely rigged out.
And then these women are dressing up the armour-bearer in the bedroom, to give him to be married to our bailiff in place of Casina;
but the artful baggages very cleverly conceal what the upshot of this3 is really to be.
Then too, in a manner quite worthy of them, the cooks are very cleverly doing their best to the end that the old gentleman mayn't get his dinner.
They are upsetting the pots, and putting out the fire with the water.
At the request of these ladies they are so doing;
they, too, are determined to bundle the old fellow dinnerless out of doors, that they by themselves may blow out their own stomachs.
I know these female gluttons;
a merchant-ship1 full of vic­ tuals they can devour.
But the door is opening.
STA. (speaking to CLEOSTRATA, within).
If you are wise, wife, you'll dine, after all, when the dinner's cooked.
I shall dine in the country, for I'm desirous to attend the new- made husband and the newly-made bride into the country (I know the mischievous habits of persons), that no one may carry her off.
Do you people indulge your appetite.
But do make haste and send him and her out immediately, that at least we may get there in daylight.
I shall be here to- morrow ;
to-morrow, wife, I'll be having a banquet still.
PAR. (aside).
'Tis as I said it would be;
the women are packing the old fellow dinnerless out of doors.
STA. (to PARDALISCA).
What are you doing here?
PAR.
I'm going whither she sent me.
STA.
Really ?
PAR.
Seriously.
STA.
What are you looking for here PPAR.
Really I'm looking for nothing at all.
STA.
Be off;
you are loitering here;
the others are bustling about in-doors.
PAR.
I'm off.
STA.
Be off, then, will you, away from here, you jade of jades.
(PARDALISCA goes into the house.)
Is she gone then ?
I may now say here anything I please.
He that's in love, i' faith, even if he is hungry, isn't hungry at all.
But see, the bailiff, my associate2, companion, and husband-in­ copartnership, is coming out of doors with wreath and torch.
OL. (to one of the MUSICIANS).
Come, piper, while they are escorting the new-made bride out of doors, make the whole of this street resound with a sweet wedding-tune1.
(He sings aloud.)
Io Hymen hymenæe!
Io Hymen!OL.
I'm very hungry, faith ;
and, in fact, I'm not thirsty a little.
STA.
But I'm in love.
OL.
Still, upon my faith, love, I shan't be making any trial of you.
For some time past my inside has been grumbling with emptiness.
STA.
But why is she now delaying so long in-doors, just as though on purpose ?
The greater the haste I'm in, in so much the less is she.
Or..
What if I were even to trill an hymeneal lay ?
STA.
I agree to that;
and I'll help you at these our common nuptials.
OL. (STALINO joining, they sing).
Hymen hymenæe!
Io Hymen.!STA.
Upon my faith, I'm dreadfully done up;
one may burst one's self with singing this hymeneal lay;
if I do burst this way2, I can't burst any other, that I may make sure of.
OL.
Upon my faith, for sure, if you were a horse, you'd never be broken in.
STA.
On what grounds ?
OL.
You are too hard-mouthed.
STA.
Have you ever found me so ?
OL.
The Gods forbid!
But the door makes a noise;
they are coming out.
STA.
I' troth, the Gods do will me to be preserved at last.
I already smell Casinas at a distance.
( They move to a distance.)
SERVo Move on, and raise your feet a little over the threshold1, newly-married bride;
prosperously commence this journey, that you may always be alive for your husband, that you may be his superior in power, and the conqueror, and that your rule may gain the upper hand.
Let your husband find you in clothes;
you plunder your husband;
by night and day to be tricking your husband, prithee, do remember.
OL. (to STALINO).
Upon my faith, at her downright peril, the instant she offends me ever so little!
STA.
Hold your tongue.
OL.
I shall not hold my tongue.
STA.
What's the matter?
OL.
These wicked jades are wickedly teaching her wicked lessons.
STA.
Instead of being all ready, they'll be bringing this matter all into confusion for me.
They are striving at that, wishing for it, that they may have it all undone.
SERVo Come, Olympio, as soon as you please, receive this wife of yours from us.
(They present CHALINUS to him.)OL.
Hand her to me then, if you are going to hand her to me at all to-day.
( They hand CHALINUS to him.)STA. (to the FEMALE SERVANTS).
Be off in-doors.
SERVo Prithee, do deal gently with her who is so young and inexperienced.
STA.
It shall be so.
Farewell;
be off now.
SERV.
Farewell. ( They go into the house.)STA.
Is my wife now gone ?
OL.
She's in the house;
don't be afraid.
STA.
Hurra!
Now, faith, I'm free at last.
(Addressing himself to CHALINUS as CASINA.)
My sweetheart, my spring- flowed, my little honey!
(Embraces him.)OL.
But, hark you!
you'll beware, if you are wise, of some mishap:
she's mine.
STA.
I know that;
but mine's the first enjoyment.
OL. (holding him the torch).
Hold this torch for me.
STA.
Why, no, I'll hold her in my arms in preference.
All-powerful Venus, a happy existence hast tho u given me in giving me the possession of her !
A dear little body !
a dear little honey !
(Hugs CHALINUS, who pretends to struggle.)OL. (shouting aloud).
0 my dear little wife !
(Jumps about on one leg.)OL.
She has trod upon my toes.
STA. (aside).
I'll compliment her, as it were.
A mist is not so soft as is(Pulls CHALINUS about.)
A pretty little bosom, upon my faith.
(CHALINUS gives hint a thrust with his elbow, on which he roars out.)
Woe to unfortunate me!
OL.
What's the matter ?
STA.
She struck me in the breast with her elbow.
OL.
Why then, pray, do you maul her about ?
But she does not do so to me, who touch her gently.
(CHALINUS gives him a poke with his elbow.)
0 me!STA.
What's the matter ?
OL.
Prithee, how robust she is!
she has almost laid me flat with her elbow.
STA.
She wishes, then, to go to bed1.
Or.
Nay but, why don't we be off?
STA. (taking hold of CHALINUS).
My pretty, pretty little dear!
(They go into the house of ALCESIMUS.)MYRR.
Having been well and handsomely entertained in- doors, we've come out here in the street to see the wedding- sports.
I'd like to know how Chalinus gets on-the newly- married bride with her new-made husband.
Never, upon my faith, any day did I laugh so much, nor in the time that's to come do I think I shall laugh more ;
and no poet ever did con trive a more artful plot than this was skilfully contrived by us.
I'd now very much like the old fellow to come out, with his face well battered, than whom there is not a more wicked old man alive.
Not even him do I deem to be more wicked who finds the room for him.
Now, Pardalisca, do you be guard here (pointing to the door of her house) ;
that whoever comes out from here, you may have some sport with him.
PAR.
I'll do it with pleasure, and in my usual way.
MYRR.
Observe from here everything that's going on in- doors.
PAR.
Prithee, get behind me.
MYRR.
You have liberty, too, to say freely and boldly to him anything you like.
PAR. (in a low voice).
Be quiet;
your door makes a noise.
( The hide themselves.)OL. (bawling aloud).
Neither where to fly to, nor where to conceal myself, nor how to hide this disgrace, do I know;
so much have my master and myself been supereminently disgraced at these nuptials of ours.
I'm now so ashamed, and now so afraid, and so ridiculous are we both.
But, a sim­ pleton, I'm now doing what's new to me:
I'm ashamed at that which has never shamed me before.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Lend me your attention, while I repeat my exploits;
it's worth your while to catch them with your ears ;
so ridiculous to be heard, to be repeated, are these mishaps which I have met with in the house.
[When straightwayl I had led my new-made bride into the room, I fastened the bolt;
but, however, the gloom there was just like the night.
I placed, I propped things against the door ;
I struggled hard2 that before the old fellow * * * * with my bride.
Then I began to be slow in my proceedings, for I looked behind me every now and then, lest the old fellow should break in * * * * *, a kiss, that provocative to lust, I asked of her first.
She pushed back my hand, and allowed me not to give her a kiss in a quiet way.
But then the more anxious was I, the more desirous to assert my privilege with Casina, and I longed to do the old fellow out of that task.
The door I blocked up, so that the old man might not over­ power me.
MYRR. (apart to CLEOSTRATA).
Come now, you accost him (Pointing to OLYMPIO.)CLE. (accosting OLYMPIO).
Where is your newly-made bride ?OL. (aside).
By heavens, I'm utterly undone;
the thing's all out.
CLE. (overhearing him).
It's right, then, that you should relate the whole affair as it happened.
What's going on in-doors ?
How fares Casina ?
Is she quite obsequious to your will ?
OL.
I'm ashamed to tell it.
CLE.
Relate it in its order just as you proceeded.
OL.
Upon my faith, I am ashamed.
CLE.
Proceed boldly.
After you went to bed, I want you to tell what took place after that.
OL.
But it's a disgraceful matter.
CLE.
I'll take care that those who hear it shall be on their guard as to mentioning it.
OL.
That's the principal thing.
CLE.
You kill me with weariness.
Why don't you pro­ ceed ?

Num cucumis POL.
When I addressed Casina, " Casina," said I, “my dear wife, why do you slight your husband in this fashion ?
Really, upon my faith, you do this quite without my deserving it, inasmuch as I have given you the preference as my wife."
She answered not a word.
When I attempted a kiss, a beard pricked my lips just like briars.
Forthwith, as I was upon my knees, she struck my head with her feet.
I tumbled headlong from the bed;
she leapt down upon me and punched my face.
From there in silence out of doors I came in this guise;
by your leaves I say it;
may the old fellow drink of the same cup that I have been drinking of.
CLE.
Most excellent.
But where's your cloak ?OL. (pointing to the house of ALCESIMUS).
I left it here in-doors.
CLE.
Well now;
hasn't a very nice trick been played you?
OL.
Yes, and deservedly.
Hush!
the door makes a noise.
What, is she following me, I wonder?
(They go to a distance.)STA. (aloud to himself).
I'in branded with the greatest disgrace, nor what, under my circumstances to do, do I know.
Nor yet how to look my wife in the face;
so utterly un­ done am I!
All my misdeeds are discovered.
In every way, to my confusion, I am ruined!
So clearly am I hooked fast by the jaws!
nor know I in what way to clear myself before mv wife;
wretch that I am, to have been stripped of my cloak:
* * * * These clandestine nuptials are all discovered.
* * * * I judge it best for me * * * *
She taught my wife * the way * *
But who is there, what person would be ready to undertake this office for me ?
What now to do I know not, except to imitate worthless slaves, and fly from the house;
for there's no safety for my shoulder-blades if I return home.
I may tell lies there;
i' faith, I shall get a basting, though much against my will, although I have earned my punishment.
I'll at once betake myself in this direction in flight.
(-He begins to run.)Or.. (coming forward with the others).
Hallo there!
Stop, this instant, you amorous one !STA. (to himself).
I'm utterly undone!

Won't you hold your tongue POL.
I' troth, I certainly shall not hold my tongue ;
for with the greatest earnestness you begged me to ask for Cassina as my wife.
STA.
That I did on account of my love for you.
CLE.
I' faith, of her rather.

He'd have been making an attack upon you, in fact.

CLE.
And do you ask me that ?
STA.
If indeed I have done so, I've been doing wrong.
CLE.
Just come back in-doors here;
I'll remind you, if you have forgotten anything.
STA.
Troth, I think, I'll believe you in preference as to what you say.
But, wife, do grant pardon to your husband for this;
Myrrhina, do entreat Cleostrata!
If ever, from this time forward, I love Casina, or even think of it, should I love her, I say, should I ever hereafter, in fact, be guilty of such a thing, there's no reason, wife, why you shouldn't lash me with twigs as I hang up by the arms.
MYRR.
On my word, I do think that forgiveness may be granted for this.
CLE. (to MYRRHINA).
I'll do as you request me.
(To STALINO.)
On this account with the less difficulty do I now grant you this pardon, that, from being a long one, we mayn't be making this Play still longer.
STA.
You are not angry ?
CLE.
I am not angry.
CLE.
You may my word.
STA.
No person ever did have a more amiable wife than I've got.
CHA.
Keep to her, then.
CLE. (to CHALINUS).
Come you, give him back his walking-stick and cloak.
CHA.
(taking them from behind him, where he had held them).
Take them, if you wish.
Upon my faith, a great in­ justice has really been most egregiously done me ;
I've been married to two husbands;
neither has behaved to me as to a new-made bride.
Spectators, what's to be done within, we'll tell you here.
This Casina will be discovered to be the daughter of this person next door1, and she'll be married to Euthynicus, our master's son.
Now it's only fair that with your deserving hands you should give us deserved applause.
He who does so, may he always keep his.
mistress without the knowledge of his wife.
But be who doesn't with his hands clap as loud as he can, in place of a mistress, may a he-goat, soused in bilge- water, be palmed off upon him2.

Scene—Calydon, a city of Ætolia.
Before the houses of AGORASTOCLES and LYCUS, and the Temple 01 Venus.
THERE were two cousins, citizens of Carthage;
the daughters of one of them, named Hanno, were stolen in their childhood, and being carried off to Calydon, were there purchased by Lyons, a Procurer.
In the same place there is living Agorastocles, the son of the cousin of Hanno, who, having been stolen in his infancy, was sold to a wealthy old man, and finally adopted by him.
Here, without knowing their relationship, Agorastocles falls in love with Adelphasium.
the elder of the sisters, while Anthemonides, a military officer, entertains a passion for Anterastylis, the younger sister.
The Procurer being at enmity with Agorastocles, the latter, with the assistance of his servant Milphio, devises a plan for outwitting him.
Collybiscus, the bailiff of Agorastocles, is dressed up as a foreigner, and, a sum of money being given him for the purpose, pretends to take up his abode in the house of Lycus.
On this being effected, by previous arrangement Agorastocles comes with witnesses, and accuses the Procurer of harbouring his slave, and encouraging him to rob his master.
At this conjuncture, Hanno arrives at Calydon in search of his daughters.
He discovers them, and finds that Agorastocles is the son of his deceased cousin.
The play ends with the removal of the damsels from the house of Lycus, who is brought to task for his iniquities;
and Adelphasium is promised by her father in marriage to Agorastocles.
A BOY (Puer), seven years old, is stolen at Carthage.
An old man, a hater (Ose- ) of women, adopts him when bought, and (Et) makes him his heir.
His two kinswomen and their nurse (Nutrix) are also carried off.
Lyons buys them and torments (Vexat) Agorastocles in love.
But he palms off his bailiff w th some gold upon the Procurer (Lenoni), and so convicts him of theft.
Hanno, the Carthaginian, comes ( Venit), discovers him to be the son of his cousin, ano recognizes his own (Suas) daughters whom lie had lost.
I HAVE a mind to imitate the Achilles of Aristarchus2:
from that Tragedy I'll take for myself the opening:
“ Be silent, and hold your tongues, and give attention."
The head-manager it is who bids you listen, that with a good grace they may be seated on the benches, both those who have come hungry and those who have come well filled.
You who have eaten, by far the most wisely have you done:
you who have not eaten, do you be filled with the Play.
But he who has something ready for him to eat, 'tis really great folly in him, for our sakes, to come here to Bit fasting.
Rise up, cryer!
bespeak attention among the people:
l'in now waiting to see if you know your duty.
Exercise your voice, by means of which you subsist and find your clothes ;
for unless you do cry out, in your silence starvation will be creeping upon you.
Well, now sit down again, that you may earn double wages.
Heaven grant success!
do you obey my commands.
Let no worn-out debauchee2 be sitting in the front of the stage, nor let the lictor or his rodas be noisy in the least;
and let no seat-keeper4 be walking about before people's faces, nor be showing any to their seats, while the actor is on the stage.
Those who have been sleeping too long at home in idleness, it's right for them now to stand contentedly, or else let them master their drowsiness.
Don't let slaves be occupying the seats5, that there may be room for those who are free;
or else let them pitY down the money for their places6;
if that they cannot do, let them be off home, and escape a double evil, lest they be variegated both here with scourges, and with thongs at home, if they've not got things in due order when their masters come home.
Let nurses keep children, baby-bantlings, at home, and let no one bring them to see the Play;
lest both they them- selves may be athirst1, and the children may die with hun­ ger;
and that they mayn't be squealing about here, in their hungry fits, just like kids.
Let the matrons see the piece in silence, in silence laugh, and let them refrain from screaming here with their shrill voices;
their themes for gossip let them carry off home, so as not to be an annoyance to their husbands both here and at home.
And, as regards the managers of the performance, let not the palm of victory be given to any player wrongfully, nor by reason of favour let any be driven out of doors, in order that the inferior may be preferred to the good ones.
And this, too, besides, which I had almost forgotten:
while the performance is going on, do you, lac­ queys, make an onset on the cooks hops;
now, while there's an opportunity, now, while the tarts2 are smoking hot, hasten there.
These injunctions, which have been given as the manager's command, Heaven prosper them !
troth now, let every one remember for himself.
Now, in its turn, I wish to go back to the plot, that you may be equally knowing with myself.
Its site, its limits, its boundaries I'll now lay down;
for that purpose have I been appointed surveyor.
But, unless it's troublesome, I wish to give you the name of this Comedy:
but if it is an annoyance, I'll tell you still, since I have leave from those who have the management.
This Comedy is called the “ Carthaginian3;
” in the Latin, Plautus has called it "the Pulse-eating Kinsman4."
You have the name, then;
now hear the rest of the story;
for here will this plot be judged of by you.
Its own stage is the proper place for every plot;
you are the critics;
I pray you lend attention.
There were two cousins-ger- man1, Carthaginians, of a very high and very wealthy family.
One of them is still alive, the other's dead.
The more con­ fidently do I inform you of this, because the undertaker2 told me so, who anointed him for the pile.
But the only SOil there was of that old man who died, being separated from his father, was stolen at Carthage when seven years old, six years, in fact, before his father died.
When he saw that his only )n was lost to him, he himself, from grief, fell sick;
he nade this cousin-german of his his heir;
he himself de­ parted for Acheron without taking leaves.
The person who stole the child, carried him off to Calydon, and sold him here to a certain rich old man for his master, one de­ sirous of children, but a hater of women.
This old man, without knowing it, bought the son of his host, that same child, and adopted him as his own son, and made him his heir when he himself departed this life.
This young man is dwelling here in this house.
(Pointing to the house of AGO­ RASTOCLES.)
Once more do I return to Carthage.
If you want to give any commission, or anything to be managed- unless a person4 gives the money, he will be mistaken;
but he who does give it will be very much more mistaken.
But this father's cousin of his at Carthage, the old man who is still alive, had two daughters.
The one when in her fifth year, the other in her fourth, were lost, together with their nurse, from the walks in the suburbs5.
The person who kidnapped them, carried them off to Anactorium1, and sold them al, both nurse and girls, for ready money, to a man (if a Procurer is a man) the most accursed of men, as many as the earth con­ tains ;
but do you yourselves now form a conjecture what sort of man it is whose name is Lycus2.
He removed, not long ago, from Anactorium, where he formerly lived, to Calydon3 here, for the sake of his business.
He dwells ir that house.
(Pointing to the house of Lycus.)
This young man is dying distractedly in love with one of them, his kins­ woman, not knowing that fact;
neither is he aware who she is, nor has he ever touched her (so much does the Procurer hamper him) ;
neither has he hitherto ever had any improper connexion with her, nor ever taken her home to his home;
nor has that Procurer been willing to send her there.
Be­ cause he sees that he is in love, he wishes to touch this man for a good haul.
A certain Captain, who is desperately in love with her, is desirous to buy this younger one to be his mistress.
But their father, the Carthaginian, since he lost them, has been continually seeking them in every quarter, by sea and land.
When he has entered any city, at once he seeks out all the courtesans, wherever each of them is living;
he gives her gold, and prolongs the night in his enquiries ;
after that he asks whence she comes, of what country, whether she was made captive or kidnapped, born of what family, who her parents were.
So diligently and so skilfully does he seek for his daughters.
He knows all languages, too ;
but, though he knows them, he pretends not to know them :
what need is there of talking ?
He is a Carthaginian all over4.
He, in the evening of yesterday, came into liar­ bour here on board ship.
The father of these girls, the same is the father's cousin of this young man.
Now d'yo take1 this ?
If you d o take it, draw it out:
take care not to break it asunder;
pray, let it proceed.
(-Moving as if to go.)
Dear me!
I had almost forgotten to say the rest.
He who adopted this young man as his own son, the same was the guest of that Carthaginian, this old man's father.
He will come here to-day, and discover his daughters here, and this person, his cousin's son, as indeed I've learnt.
He, I say, who'll come to-day, will find his daughters and this his cousin's son.
But after this, farewell !-attend;
I'm off;
I now intend to become another man2.
As to what remains, some others remain who'll explain all to you.
I'll go and dress.
With kindly feelings do you then recognize me.
Farewell!
and give me your aid, that Salvation may prove propitious to you.
AGO.
Full oft have I entrusted many matters to you, Milphio, matters of doubt and necessity, and standing in need of good counsel, which you wisely, discreetly, cleverly, and skilfully have by your aid brought to completion for me.
For which services I do confess that both your liberty and many kind thanks are due unto you.
MIL.
An old adage, if you timely introduce it, is a clever thing:
but your compliments are to me what are wont to be called sheer nonsense, and, upon my faith, mere bagatelles3.
Just now, you are full of kind speeches towards me;
yester­ day, without hesitation, upon my back you wore out three bulls' hides withflogging.
AGo.
But if, being in love, I did anything by reason of my distraction, Milphio, it's only reasonable that you should pardon me for it.
MIL.
I've seen nothing more reasonable.
I, too, am now dying for love;
allow me to thrash you just as you did me, for no fault at all;
and then, after that, do you pardon me being thus in love.
AGo.
If you have a mind for it, or it gives you pleasure, I do permit it;
tie me up, bind me, scourge me;
I recommend you, I give you my permission.
MIL.
If, hereafter, you should revoke your permission, when you are unloosed, I myself should be hung up1 for punishment.
A GO.
And would I venture to do that, to yourself espe­ cially ?
On the contrary, if I see you but struck, it gives me pain immediately.
MIL.
To me, indeed, i' faith.
AGo.
No, to me.
MIL.
I could prefer that to be the case.
But what now do you wish ?
AGO.
Why need I tell a lie to you ?
I am desperately in love.
MIL.
My shoulder-blades feel that.
AGO.
But I mean with this damsel, my neighbour Adel­ phasium, the elder Courtesan that belongs to this Procurer.
MIL.
For my own part, I've heard that from yourself already.
AGO.
I'm on the rack with love for her.
But than this Procurer Lycus, her master, not dirt itself is more dirty.
MIL.
Do you wish now to present him with some mis­ chief?
AGO.
I should like it.
MIL.
Why look then, present him with me.
AGO.
Go and be hanged!
MIL.
But tell me seriously, do you wish to present him with a plague ?
AGO.
I should like it.
MIL.
Well then, present him with this selfsame me ;
I'd cause him to be having both a mischief and a plague.
AGO.
You are joking.
MIL.
Should you like this very day, without risk to yourself, to make her free1 ?
AGO.
I should like it, Milphio.
MIL.
I'll manage for you to make her so.
You have in- doors three hundred golden Philippean pieces2.
AGO.
Six hundred even.
MIL.
Three hundred are enough.
AGO.
To do what with them ?
MIL.
Hold your peace.
This day I'll make you a present of the Procurer, whole, with all his household.
AGO.
What to do ?
MIL.
You shall soon know.
Colly­ biscus, your bailiff, is in the city just now.
The Procurer doesn't know I im.
Do you fully understand ?
AGO.
I' faith, I understand that;
but what you are driving at I know not.
MIL.
You don't know?
AGO.
Not I, faith.
MIL.
But I'll soon let you know.
The gold shall be given him, for him to take to the Procurer, and say that he's a stranger from another city;
that he's amorously inclined, and wishes to gratify his inclinations;
that he wants free range to be found him, where he may secretly indulge his appetite, so that there may be no overlooker.
The Procurer, greedy for the gold, will at once take him into his house;
he'll conceal the man and the gold.
AGO.
The design pleases me.
MIL.
Do you then enquire of him whether your slave hasn't come to him.
He'll think that I am being sought for;
im­ mediately he'll say no to you.
Have you any doubt but that the Procurer will at once have to double the gold for you, and be considered to have stolen the man ?
Neither has he the means of raising it.
When he comes to trial, the Prætor will awards his whole household to you.
Thus with a pitfall shall we deceive the Procurer Lycus.
AGO.
The design pleases me.
MIL.
Aye, when I've polished it up, you'll then say so still more even;
now it's but in the rough.
AGO.
I'm going to the Temple of Venus, unless, Milphio, you wish for anything.
It's the Aphrodisiac to-day.
MIL.
I know.
AGO.
I wish to amuse my eyes with the harlot finery.
MIL.
Let's first proceed to this, the plan we have resolved upon.
Let's go in-doors, that we may instruct Collybiscus, the bailiff, how to plant this cheatery.
AGO.
Although Cupid has the sway in my heart, still I'll listen to you.
MIL.
I'll cause you to be glad it's done.
(AGORASTOCLES goes into his house.)
There is a speck of love upon this man's breast, which cannot by any means be washed out without great harm;
this Lycus, too, the Procurer, is such a wicked person, against whom the engine of mischief is now well aimed, which before long I shall discharge from my battery2.
But see, here's Adelphasium coming out, and Anterastylis.
The first is the one who renders my master distracted.
But I'll call him out.
(Goes to the door and calls.)
Hallo!
Agorastocles, come out of doors if you would see most joyous sports!
AGO.
What's this bustle, Milphio ?MIL.
(pointing to the door of LYCUS'S house).
Why, here's your mistress, if you'd like to see her.
AGo.
0 may the Gods bestow many a blessing on you, for having presented to me a sight so charming as this!
(They stand apart.)ADEL.
The man who wants to find abundance of employ­ ment for himself-a woman and a ship, these two things, let him procure;
for no two things do produce more trouble, if, perchance, you begin to equip them;
neither are these two things ever equipped enough, nor is the largest amount of equipment sufficient for them.
And as I mention these things, from experience at home do I now say thus;
for we two, even from daybreak up to the present hour of the day, have never ceased either washing, or scrubbing, or rubbing, or dressing, smoothing, polishing, painting, trim­ ming, with all our might, and at the same time the two maid-servants, that have been provided for each of us, have been giving us their assistance in washing and cleaning;
and in carrying water two men have become quite weary.
Fie upon it!
how great a plague there is in one female.
But if there are two, I know full well that they are able to give to any one, the mightiest nation whatsoever, more trouble than enough, in being night and day, always, at all hours, dress­ ing, washing, rubbing, polishing.
In fine, there's no mode­ ration in women, nor do we understand how ever to set a limit to washing and scrubbing.
But she who is washed clean, unless she is thoroughly dressed, in my notion at least, is just as though she were dirty.
ANT.
I really wonder, sister, that you talk in this fashion;
you who are so knowing, and discreet, and clever;
for when with all care we have ourselves in trim, hardly and with diffi­ culty do we find poor pitiful admirers.
ADEL.
Such is the fact;
but still reflect upon this one thing;
a limit is best to be observed in all thins s, sister;
all things in excess give too much trouble to mortals of them­ selves.
ANT.
Sister, prithee, do reflect that we are accounted just in the same way as pickled salt-fish1 is thought of-without any relish and without sweetness;
unless full oft and long it is soaked in water, it smells badly, and is salt, so that you cannot touch it.
Just so are we.
Women of this class are utterly tasteless, and devoid of grace, without dress and expense.
MIL. (apart).
She surely is a cook, Agorastocles, accord­ ing to my notion ;
she knows how to soak pickled fish.
AGO.
(pushing him away).
Why are you thus troublesome PADEL.
Sister, do, there's a dear, forbear.
It's quite sum­ cient for others to say that to us, not to be ourselves as well proclaiming our foibles.
ANT.
I'll have done, then.
ADEL.
I thank you:
but now answer me this;
are all things here which ought to be provided for propitiating the Gods ?
ANT.
I've taken care of everything.
AGO. (apart).
How charming and joyous a day, and full of delight, worthy of Venus, by my troth, whose Aphrodisia are celebrated to-day!
MIL. (apart).
Any thanks for me, for calling you out of doors ?
Oughtn't I now to be presented with a cask of old wine ?
Say it shall be given.
Don't you answer me ?
His tongue has fallen out, I imagine.
What, plague on it, have you been struck with amazement standing here ?
(He shakes him.)AGO. (apart).
Do let me love on;
don't disturb me, and do hold your peace.
MIL. (apart).
I'll hold my peace.
AGO. (apart).
If you had held your peace, why then that “ I'll hold my peace" would not have been in existence.
ANT.
Let's go, my sister.
(She moves.)ADEL.
How now-why, prithee, are you now hastening that way ?
ANT.
Do you ask me P Because our master is waiting for .us at the Temple of Venus.
ADEL.
Let him wait, i' faith.
Do you stay;
there's a crowd just now at the altar.
Do you wish yourself to be pushed about among those common prostitutes, the doxies of bakers, the cast-offs of the spelt-bread sellers ;
wretched creatures, daubed over with greasel, followers of poor slaves, who stink for you of their stable and stall2, their seats and very sheds;
whom, in fact, not a single freeman has ever touched or taken home with him, the twopenny strumpets of dirty trumpery slaves ?MIL. (apart).
Away with you to utter perdition!
Do you dare, then, to despise the slaves, you hussey ?
As if she was a beauty, as if kings were in the habit of making her their choice.
A monstrosity of a woman!
Diminutive as she is, she does spit out such mighty words-seven nights with whom I wouldn't purchase at a cupful of vapour.
AGO. (apart).
Immortal and omnipotent Divinities, what is there among you more beauteous ?
What have you that I should deem you more immortal than I am myself, in be­ holding with my- eyes these delights so great?
But Venus is not Venus ;
for my own part, her will I worship as Venus ;
that she may love me and prove propitious.
Milphio!— hallo!
Milphio, where are you ?MIL. (apart).
See, here I am with you.
AGO. (apart).
But I want you boiled2.
MIL. (apart).
Why really, master, you are making merry.
AGO. (apart).
Why, it was from yourself I learnt all this.
MIL. (apart).
What, even to be in love with her whom you have never touched ?
Really, that is nonsense.
AGO. (apart).
I’ faith, the Gods as well do I love and fear from whom, nevertheless, I keep off my hands.
ANT.
Alas!
upon my word, when I look at the dress of us both, I'm grieved at the way we are dressed out.
ADEL.
Why really, it's quite in a proper style;
for our master's gain and our own we are dressed quite well enough.
For no profits can result, if the outlay exceeds them, sister ;
therefore, that is better to be had which is enough, than that which is more than enough.
AGO. (apart).
So may the Gods love me, may she love ine (I had rather she than the Gods), Milphio;
why, this woman has it in her power to force a flint-stone to be in love with her.
MIL. (apart).
Upon my faith, in that you certainly tell no lie, for you are more senseless than a flint-stone to be in love with her.
AGO. (apart).
But consider this, will you;
I've never soiled her1 with a kiss.
MIL. (apart).
I'll run, then, somewhere to a fish-pond or a pool, and fetch some soil.
AGO. (apart).
What need is there of that ?
MIL. (apart).
I'll tell you;
to soil her lips and yours.
AGO. (apart).
To utter perdition with you!
MIL. (apart).
For my part, I'm there already.
AGO. (apart).
Do you persist ?MIL. (apart).
I'll hold my tongue.
AGO. (apart).
But I wish you to do so always.
MIL. (apart).
Why really, master, you challenge me at my own game, and still you make fun of me.
ANT.
At present, sister, I suppose you think yourself quite well enough drest;
but when the instances of other courtesans are compared, then you will be having the heart- ache, if perchance you should see any one more nicely drest.
ADEL.
Envy was never inbred in me, my sister, nor yet spitefulness:
I had rather by far that I was adorned with a good disposition than with gold;
gold is met with by luck, a good disposition is found by nature.
I very much prefer for myself to be called good than fortunate.
It more befits a courtesan to show modesty than purple;
and more does it become a courtesan to show modesty than golden jewels.
Evil habits soil a fine dress more than mud;
good manners, by their deeds, easily set off a lowly garb.
AGo. (apart to MILPHIO).
How now, you;
would you like to play a merry and a frolicsome prank ?MIL. (apart).
I should like.
AGO. (apart).
Can you, then, give attention to me?
MIL. (apart).
I can.AGO. (apart).
Be off home, and go hang yourself.
MIL. (apart).
Why?
AGO. (apart).
Because you'll never again hear so many words as sweet as these.
What need have you to live ?
Only listen to me, and go hang yourself.
MIL. (apart)
Why yes, if, like grapes that are drying1, you'll hang together with me.
AGO. (apart).
But I do love her.
MIL. (apart).
But I, to eat and drink.
ADEL. (to her SISTER).
How now, you?
How say you—PANT.
What is it you ask me ?
ADEL.
Do you see ?
My eyes which were full of dirt, are they clear now PANT.
(looking close at her eyes).
Why, even still there's a little dirt in the middle of the eye.
A-DEL.
Lend me your right hand, please.
AGO. (apart).
And would you really touch or rub her eyes with unwashed hands ?
ANT.
Too great indolence has taken possession of us to-day.
ADEL.
For what reason, prithee ?
ANT.
Why, because we didn't come long since, before day­ light, to the Temple of Venus, to be the first to place fire upon her altar.
ADEL.
0, there's no need for doing that;
those who have faces suited for the night only, make haste to go and sacri­ fice by night;
before Venus is awake, they are already hurry­ ing with all haste to sacrifice;
for if they were to come when Venus is awake, so ugly are they, upon my faith, I do believe they would drive Venus herself away from the Temple.
AGO. (apart).
Milphio!
MIL. (apart).
Poor Milphio, i' faith!
What do you want with me now ?AGO. (apart).
Troth now, prithee, do mark how she speaks honied wine!
MIL. (apart).
Nothing at all, except tile-cakes2, sesamum, and poppies, wheat and parched nuts.
AGO. (apart).
Do I seem at all to be in love ?
MIL. (apart).
In love to your loss, a thing that Mercury is by no means in love with3.
AGO. (apart).
Why, really, by my troth, it befits no lover to be in love with pelf.
ANT.
Let's go, my sister.
ADEL.
Do, please, just as you like.
Follow me this way.
ANT.
I'll follow.
(They move.)AGO. (apart).
They are going.
What if we accost them?
MIL. (apart).
You accost them.
AGO.
(going towards them).
In the first place, health to you, the elder;
and you, the younger, health to you in the second degree of estimation;
(to the ATTENDANT) you, the third, health to you, without any place in my estimation.
ATT.
In that case, faith, I've wasted my oil and my labour.
AGO. (to ADELPHASIUM).
Whither are you betaking your­ self ?
ADEL.
What I To the Temple of Venus.
AGO.
Why thither P ADEL.
To propitiate Venus.AGO.
How now ?
Is she angry, then ?
Upon my faith, she is propitious.
I will even answer for her.
(Stands before her.)AGO.
Thus cruel ?
Alas!
ADEL.
Let me go away, I beg of you.
AGO.
Why in such a hurry ?
There's a crowd there at present.
ADEL.
I know it;
there are other females there whom I wish to see, and by whom to be seen.
AGO.
How can it give you pleasure to look at ugly people, and to afford one so beauteous to be looked at ?
ADEL.
Because to-day, at the Temple of Venus, there's a fair for the courtesans;
there the dealers meet;
there I wish myself to be shown.
AGO.
To wares unsaleable, its right to entice the buyer of one's own accord;
good wares easily meet with a purchaser, although they may be placed in concealment.
How say you ?
When, at my house here (pointing) will you lay your head and side by me ?
ADEL.
On the day on which Orcus sends away the dead1 from Acheron.
AGO.
I've got in-doors I know not how many golden coins in a state of madness.
ATEL.
Bring them to me;
I'll make their madness pretty soon come to an end.
MIL. (with indignation).
A nice one, upon my word !
AGO.
Away to utter and extreme perdition with you, and go and be hanged!
MIL. (aside to AGORASTOCLES).
The more I look at her, the more insignificant!
she is, and a mere bauble.
AGO.
Keep your prating to yourself;
I'm tired of it.
( To ADELPHASIUM.)
Come, do lift up this outer garment.
(Raises it from the ground, and attempts to embrace her.)ADEL.
I'm in a state of purity2 ;
prithee forbear to touch me, Agorastocles.
AGO.
What am I to do, then ?
ADEL.
If you are wise, you may be saving yourself your anxiety.
AGO.
What?
Me not be anxious on your account?
What are you about, Milphio ?
(Beckons to him.)MIL. (aside).
See now, my aversion, this3.
(Aloud.)
What is it you want with me ?AGO.
(pointing to ADELPHASIUM).
Why is she angry with me ?
MIL.
Why is she angry with you ?
Why should I trouble myself about that ?
For that is rather your own concern.
AGO.
On my word, it's all over with you this very instant, if you don't make her as smooth for me as the sea is at the time when the halcyon4 is rearing her young ones there.
AGO.
Entreat her, soothe, and flatter her.
MIL.
I'll do so with all diligence;
but see.
please, that you don't afterwards be giving this ambassador of yours a dressing with your fists.
AGo.
I'll not do so.
ADEL. (to her SISTER).
Let's now begone.
(AGORASTO­ CLES stands before her.)
Do you detain me still P
You act badly;
you make me many fair promises;
of those many, the whole come to nothing at all.
Not once, but a hundred times, have you sworn to give me my freedom.
While de­ pending on you, I have neither anywhere procured any other resources for myself, nor is this assistance of yours at all visible.
And thus none the less am I still a slave.
Move on, sister.
(To AGORASTOCLES.)
Get you gone from me!
AGo.
Utterly undone!
Come now, Milphio, what are you about ?
Points at ADELPHASIUM.)MIL. (addressing ADELPHASIUM).
My joy, my delight, my life, my pleasure, apple of my eye, my little lip, my health, my sweet kiss, my honey, my heart, my biestings, my cream-cheese—AGO. (aside).
Am I to allow these things to be said in my presence ?
I'm quite distracted, wretch that I am, if I don't order him at full speed to be hurried off to the exe­ cutioner in a chariot and four!
MIL. (to ADELPHASIUM).
Prithee, for my sake, don't be angry with my master.
I'll makeADEL.
Let me alone.
MIL.
You are too cross.
He'll pay the money for you, and make you a citizen of Attica2, and a free woman.
ADEL. (to MILPHIO, who is standing before her).
But why don't you let me go away ?
What is it you want ?
Just as he wishes me well, in like manner do you wish me well.
MIL.
If, indeed, he has deceived you before, from this time forward he shall be truthful to you.
ADEL.
Get you gone hence, will you, you trepanner.
MIL.
I'll obey you.
But on what terms-do you under­ stand ?
Do let me prevail upon you;
do let me take you by those little ears3;
do let me give you a kiss.
By my troth, I shall now set him a weeping, if I don't make you kind;
Act L and (unless I do make you kind he certainly will do it) I'm dreadfully afraid lest he should beat me.
I know the harsh manners of this crabbed man.
Wherefore, my delight, pray do let me prevail upon you.
AGO. (aside).
I'm not a man worth threepence1, if I don't tear out the eyes and teeth of that whip-scoundrel.
(He beats MILPHIO.)
There's your delight for you!
There's your honey !
There's your heart!
There are your biestings2!
There's your health!
There's your sweet kiss!
(Giving him a blow at each sentence.)MIL.
Master, you are rendering yourself guilty of impiety I You are beating an ambassador.
AGO.
More than that even still.
(Beating him again.)
I shall now add the apple of the eye, the little lip too, and the tongue,MIL.
When will you be making an end ?
AGO.
Was it in that fashion I requested you to plead for me ?
MIL.
How then was I to plead ?
AGO.
Do you ask me that ?
Why thus you should have said, you scoundrel:
" his” delight, I do entreat of you, " his” honey, "his" heart, "his" little lip, "his" tongue, "his" street kiss, "his" biestings, "his" sweet cream-cheese, you whip-scoundrel.
All these things which you spoke of as yours, you should have mentioned as mine.
MIL. (addressing ADELPHASIUM).
By my troth, I do en­ treat you, his delight and my own aversion;
his full-bosomed mistress, my enemy and evil-wisher;
his eye, my eyesore;
his honey, my gall—don't you be angry with him ;
or, if that cannot be, do take a rope and hang yourself, with your master and your household:
for I see that henceforth, on your account, I shall have to live upon sighing;
and as it is, I've already got my back about as hard with weals as an oyster-shell, by reason of your amours.
ADEL.
Prithee, do you wish me to hinder him from beat­ ing you, rather than that he should not prove untrue to­ wards me ?ANT. (to her SISTER).
Do answer him in somewhat kindly terms, there's a dear, that he mayn't be annoying to us ;
for he's detaining us from our purpose.
ADEL.
That's true.
This one fault more will 1 pardon you for, Agorastocles.
I am not angry.
AGO.
You are not ?
ADEL.
I am not.
AGO.
That I may believe you, give me a kiss then.
ADEL.
I'll give you one by-and-by, when I return from the sacrifice.
AGo.
Be off, then, in all haste.
ADEL.
Follow me, sister.
AGo.
And do you hear too ?
Pay all compliments to Venus in my name.
ADEL.
I'll pay them.
AGO.
Listen to this, tooADEL.
What is it ?
AGO.
Perform the ceremony in few words.
And do you hear?
Look back at me.
(She looks back.)
She did look back.
By my troth, I trust that Venus will do the same for you.
(ADELPHASIUM, ANTERASTYLlS, and ATTENDANT, go into the Temple of Venus.)AGO.
What now do you advise me to do, Milphio ?
MIL.
To give me a beating, and then have an auction1;
for (pointing to the house) really, upon my faith, with utter impunity you might put up this house for sale.
AGO.
Why so ?
MIL.
For the greater part you make your dwelling in my mouth2.
AGo.
Do have done with those expressions.
MIL.
What now do you wish ?
AGO.
I just now gave three hundred Philippeans to the bailiff Collybiscus, before you called me out of doors.
I now adjure you, Milphio, by this right hand, and by this left hand its sister, and by your eyes, and by my passion, and by my own Adelphasium, and by your liberty3—MIL.
Why, now you adjure me by nothing at all.
AGo.
My dear little Milphio, my kind occasion, my safe­ guard, do what you promised me you would do, that I may prove the ruin of this Procurer.
MIL.
Why, that's very easy to be done.
Be off, bring here with you your witnesses;
meanwhile, in-doors I'll forth­ with provide your bailiff with my disguise and stratagems.
Make haste and be off.
AGo.
I fly.
MIL.
That's more my part1 than yours.
AGO.
Should I not, should I not, if you effect this adroitly2MIL.
Only do begone.
AGO.
Ought I not this very day-MIL.
Only do be off.
AGo.
To give you freedom—MIL.
Only do begone.
A GO.
By my troth, I should not deserve—ah!
MIL.
Bah!
Only do be off.
AGO.
As many as are the dead in Acheron-MIL.
Will you, then, move off?
AGo.
Nor yet as many as there are waves in the sea—MIL.
Are you going to move off?
AGO.
Nor as many as there are clouds—MIL.
Do you persist in going on this way?
AGO.
Nor as there are stars in heavenMIL.
Do you persist in dinning my ears ?
AGo.
Neither this thing nor that;
nor yet, indeed, seri­ ously speaking-nor, by my faith, indeed.
What need is there of words ?
And why not ?-a thing that in one word -here we may say anything we please-and yet, i' faith, not seriously in reality.
D'ye see how 'tis ?
So may the Gods bless me!—do you wish me to tell you in honest truth ?
A thing that here we may between ourselves-so help me Jupiter Do you see how ?
Look you—do you believe what I tell you ?
MIL.
If I cannot make you go away, I shall go away myself:
for really;
"pon my faith, there's need of an Œdipus1 as a diviner for this speech of yours, him who was the interpreter to the Sphinx.
(He goes into the house of AGORASTOCLES.)AGO.
He has gone off in a passion;
now must 1 be­ ware, lest, through my own fault, I place an impediment in the way of my love.
I'll go and fetch the witnesses since love commands me, a free man, to be obedient to my own slave.
(-Exit.LYC. (to himself).
May all the Gods render him unfortunate, should any Procurer, after this day, ever immolate any victim to Venus, or should any one sacrifice a single grain of frank­ incense.
For wretched I, this day, have sacrificed to my most wrathful Deities2 six lambs, and still I could not manage to make Venus to be propitious unto me.
Since I could not ap­ pease her, forthwith I departed thence in a passion;
I forbade the entrails to be cut, and would not examine them.
Inasmuch as the soothsayer pronounced them not propitious, I deemed the Goddess not deserving.
By these means I fairly played a trick upon the greedy Venus.
When, that which was enough, she would not have to be enough, I made a pause.
'Tis thus I act, and thus it befits me to act.
I'll make the other Gods and Goddesses henceforth more contented, and less greedy, when they know how the Procurer put a trick upon Venus.
The soothsayer, in manner right worthy of him, a fellow not worth threepence, said that in all the entrails misfortune and loss were portended to me, and that the Gods were angry with me.
In what matter either divine or human is it right for me to put trust in him ?
Just after that, a mina of silver was given me.
But where, pray, has this Captain stopped just now, who gave it me, and whom I've invited to breakfast ?
But look!
here he comes.
ANTH.
So, as I began to tell you, you sorry pimp, about that Pentetbronic battle1, in which, with my own hands, in one day, I slew sixty thousand flying men.
LYC.
Heyday!
Flying men ?
ANTH.
Certainly I do affirm it.
LYC.
Prithee, are there anywhere men that fly ?
ANTH.
There were ;
but I slew them.
LYC.
How could you ?
ANTH.
I'll tell you.
I gave birdlime and slings to my troops;
beneath it they laid leaves of coltsfoot2.
LYC.
For what purpose ?
ANTH.
That the birdlime mightn't adhere to the slings.
LYC.
Proceed. (Aside.)
I' faith, you do lie most egregi­ ously.
(Aloud.)
What after that ?
ANTH.
They placed pretty large pellets of birdlime in their slings:
with which I ordered them to be taken aim at as they flew.
Why many words ?
Each one did they hit with the birdlime—they fell to the ground as thick as pears.
As each one dropped, I straightway pierced him through the brain with his own feathers, just like a turtle-dove.
LYC.
By my troth, if ever this did take place, then may Jupiter make me to be ever sacrificing, and never propitiat­ ing him.
ANTH.
And don't you believe me in this ?
LYC.
I do believe, in the same degree that it is proper that I should be believed.
Come, let's go in-doors, until the entrails are brought home.
LYC.
I don't care about it.
ANTH.
Do listen.
LYC.
Upon my faith, no.
ANTH.
Why then I'll break your head this instant, if you don't listen, or else be off to utter perdition!
Lie.
I'd sooner go to utter perdition !
LYC.
Determined.
ANTH.
In that case, do you, then, upon this lucky day, the Aphrodisia, make over to me the younger one of your courtesans.
LYC.
The sacred ceremony has by its omens been to me to- day of such a nature—I put off all serious matters from to- day until another day.
I am resolved to make it really a holiday.
Now let's go hence in-doors.
Follow me this way.
ANTE.
I follow.
For this day, then, I'm out on hire to you.
(They go into the house of LYCUS.)AGO.
So- may the Deities love me, there's nothing more annoying than a tardy friend, especially to a man in love, who's in a hurry in everything that he does ;
just as I'm leading on these assistants, fellows of most crawling step;
they are more slow than merchant-ships in a calm sea.
And upon my faith, I really did on purpose wave my aged friends;
I knew they were too slow through their years;
I apprehended delay to my passion;
in vain I selected for myself these young fellows on their preferment, timber-legged, most tardy chaps.
Well (turning round to them), if you are going to come to-day, get on, or get off hence to utter perdition!
Is this the way it befits friends to give their assistance to a person in love ?
Why sure, this pace was bolted through a fine flour- sieve1;
unless you have been practising in fetters to creep along thus with this step.
ASSIST.
Hark you!
although we seem to you of the coin­ monalty and poor, if you don't speak us fair, you rich mail of highest rank, we are in the habit of boldly playing the mis­ chief with the rich man;
we are under no engagement to you, about what it is that you love or hate.
When we paid money for our freedom1, we paid our own, not yours ;
it's right that we should be under no restraint.
We value you at nought;
don't you fancy that we've been made over as slaves to your passion.
It's proper for free men to go through the city at a moderate pace;
I deem it like a slave to be running along in a bustle.
Especially when the state is at peace and the enemies are slain, it is not decent to make a tumult.
But if you were for making greater haste, you ought to have brought us here as assistants the day before.
Don't you fancy it-not any one of us will this day be running through the streets, nor yet shall the people pelt us with stones for madmen.
AGO.
But if I had said that I was taking you to a Temple2 to breakfast, you would have surpassed a stag in speed, or a man on stilts in your steps.
Now, because I have said that I am taking you as my assistants and witnesses, you are gouty, and in the slowness of your pace have been outdoing the snail.
ASSIST.
Why, really, is there not good cause for running swiftly, where you are to drink and eat at another man's ex­ pense as much as you please, until you are full, what you need never return against your will to your host, at whose expense you have been eating ?
But still, in some way or other, although we are poor men, we have at home something to eat;
don't you browbeat us in such a contemptuous way.
Whatever that very little is, that little of ours is all at home;
we neither dun any one ourselves, nor does any one dun us.
Not one of us is going to burst the veins of his lungs for your sake.
AGO.
You are too warm;
really, I said this to you in joke.
ASSIST.
Consider it said in joke as well what we have said to you in answer.
AGO.
Troth now, prithee, do give me this aid of yours like a fly-boat, not a merchant-ship.
Do hobble along at least, for I do not ask you to hurry.
ASSIST.
If you wish to do anything quietly and leisurely.
we lend our aid;
if you are in a hurry, it would be better for you to hire runners1 as your assistants.
AGO.
You understand (the matter I've informed you of), that I have need of your assistance with regard to this Pro­ curer, who has so long trifled with me in my amour;
that a scheme is to be planned against him about the gold and my servant.
ASSIST.
All that we know already, if these Spectators know.
For the sake of these Spectators it is that this Play is now being acted.
'Twere better for you to inform them, that when you do anything, they may know what it is you are doiug.
Don't you trouble about us;
we know the whole matter;
since we all learnt it together in company with your­ self, so that we can answer you.
AGo.
Such really is the fact;
but come, that I may be sure then that you know it, repeat the matter at length, and tell me what I told you just now.
ASSIST.
Are you trying in this way whether we know ?
Do you suppose we don't remember how you have given three hundred Philippeans to Collybiscus your bailiff, for him to bring here to the Procurer, your enemy, and to pretend that he is a foreigner from a distance, from another city ?
When lie has brought them, you'll go there to seek your servant together with the money.
AGO.
You remember it by heart;
you have saved me.
ASSIST.
He'll be for denying it;
he'll suppose your Milphio is being looked for.
He'll have to pay double all the money stolen;
the Procurer will be adjudged to you.
In this matter you wish us to be your witnesses.
AGO.
You've got the matter fast.
ASSIST.
I' faith, hardly with the tips- of our fingers, in­ deed ;
it is so very small a one.
AGo.
This must be done quickly and with expedition.
Make as much haste, then, as you can.
ASSIST.
(moving as though going).
Kindly fare you well, then;
it's better for you to provide some active assistants, we are but slow ones.
AGO.
You move very welll.
(Aside.)
But very badly do you speak me, faith.
(Aloud.)
Moreover, I could wish your thighs to fall down into your ankles.
ASSIST.
And, i' faith, we that your tongue hadfallen into your loins, and your eyes upon the ground.
AGO.
Heyday!
it's not for you to be angry at what I said in joke.
ASSIST.
Nor for you, indeed, to be speaking ill to your friends in joke.
AGO.
Drop this.
What I want to do, you understand.
ASSIST.
We know full well:
to undo the perjured Pro­ curer, it's that you wish.
AGO.
You've got the matter right.
See, Milphio and the bailiff are opportunely coming out together.
He's coming rigged out like a nobleman, and appropriately, for the plot.
MIL.
Have you now got your instructions by heart ?
COLL.
Nicely.
MIL.
Take care you understand them, please.
COLL.
What need is there of talking ?
I won't let my own legs understand2 as well.
MIL.
Only take you care that your speeches are learnt by heart for this plot.
COLL.
Why, upon my faith, I am more perfect than tragic or comic actors are.
MIL.
You are a capital fellow.
AGO. (to the ASSISTANTS).
Let's go nearer to them.
(Accosting MILPHIO and COLLYBISCUS.)
Here are the wit­ nesses,MIL. (to AGORASTOCLES).
Really you could not have brought as many men better suited for this purpose;
for not one of them is tongue-tied as a witness3;
they are genuine men of the law-courts;
there they take up their abode;
there you may see them more frequently than the Prætor.
At this very time there are no better cookers-up of a lawsuit1, to stir up litigation, than are these men;
for they, if there is no litigation, sow litigation.
ASSIST.
May the Gods confound you!
MIL.
You I really do commend, inasmuch as, whoever you are, still you act both worthily and kindly in giving your aid to my master thus in love.
(To AGORASTOCLES.)
But do they now know what the business is ?
AGO.
The whole matter, all in its order.
MIL.
In that case, do you, then, give me your attention.
Do you know this Procurer Lycus ?
ASSIST.
Perfectly.
COLL.
But, upon my faith, I don't know him, of what ap­ pearance he is.
I wish that you would point this fellow out to me.
ASSIST.
We'll take all care:
we've been instructed quite enough.
AGO. (pointing to COLLYBISCUS).
He has got three hundred pieces counted out.
ASSIST.
Then it's right, Agorastocles, that we should see this gold, that we may know what to say by-and-by as our testimony.
AGO.
Come and look at it.
(Opens the bag which COLLY- DISCUS holds in his hand.)COLL. (to the AUDIENCE).
Undoubtedly it's gold, Spec­ tators—playhouse gold2;
upon this, soaked in water, in fo­ eign lands, the cattle become fats:
but, for the carrying out of this design, 'tis real Philippean gold.
ASSIST.
We'll make believe it is so.
COLL.
But do you make believe as though I were a foreigner.
ASSIST.
Just so;
and, in fact, as though you, on your arrival to-day, had asked us to show you a spot for free­ dom and pleasure ;
where you might wench, drink, and live like a Greek.
MIL.
Dear me !
Crafty fellows, upon my faith!
AGO.
But it was I who instructed them.
MIL.
And who you, in your turn ?CaLL.
Come, be off in-doors, Agorastocles, lest the Pro­ curer should see you together with me, and some accident might befall our plan.
MIL.
This person is extremely prudent.
(To AGORAS­ TOCLES.)
Do as he bids you.
AGO.
Let's be off.
(To the ASSISTANTS.)
But you—has enough been said ?
CaLL.
Do you be off.
AGO.
I'm off.
Immortal Gods, I begCaLL.
Nay, but why don't you be off ?
AGo.
I'm off.
CaLL.
You do wisely.
(AGORASTOCLES and MILPHIO go into the house.)
Hush!
be quiet.
ASSIST.
What's the matter ?
CaLL.
This door (pointing to the door of the house of LYCUS) was guilty of a great indecency just now.
ASSIST.
What indecency is that ?
COLL.
It rumbled aloud.
ASSIST.
May the Deities con­ found you!
Get you behind us.
COLL.
Be it so.
(Goes behind them.)ASSIST.
We'll walk first.
COLL. (aside).
They do what town-fellows are in the habit of doing:
they put worthy men behind themselves.
ASSIST.
(pointing to the PROCURER'S house).
That man that's coming out is the Procurer.
COLL.
He's a real good one;
for he's like a bad mail.
Even now, as he comes forth, I'll suck out his blood at this distance.
LYC. (speaking to ANTHEMONIDES, within).
I'll return here this moment, Captain.
I wish to find us some fitting guests, to join us.
Meanwhile, they'll bring the entrails;
and at the same time, the women, I suppose, will soon be making their appearance at home after the sacrifice.
But why are such a number of people coming this way r I wonder what they are bringing?
He, too, ir.
the scarf, that's following at a distance, who is he, I wonder ?
He is not an Ætolian.
ASSIST.
We greet you, Lycus.
Although against our will, we give you this salul ation, and although in a very moderate degree do we entertain good wishes for procurers.
LYC.
May you all be fortunate-a thing that I know for certain you neither will be, nor will Fortune permit it so to be.
ASSIST.
That is a treasure hoarded in the tongues of fools, to deem it gainful to speak amiss to their superiors.
LYC.
He who knows not the road by which to arrive at the sea, him it befits to seek a river as his own com­ panion.
I know not the way of speaking abusively to you.
Now you are the rivers to me;
you I'm resolved to follow.
If you speak blessings, along your banks I'll follow you;
if you utter curses, along your track I'll go.
ASSIST.
To do good to the bad is a danger just as great as to do bad to the good.
LYC.
But why?
ASSIST.
You shall learn.
If you do any good to the bad, the benefit is lost:
if you do any bad to the good, it lasts for a length of time.
LYC.
Cleverly said !
But what does that matter to me ?
ASSIST.
Because for the sake of your own well-doing we came hither, although in a very moderate degree do we enter­ tain good wishes for procurers.
LYC.
If you bring anything that's good, I give you thanks.
ASSIST.
Of our own, we neither bring nor give you any­ thing that's good, nor do we promise you, nor, in fact, do we wish to give it.
LYC.
I' faith, I do believe you;
such is your kindly feel­ ing.
But what now do you wish ?
ASSIST. (pointing to COLLYBISCUS).
This person in the scarf, whom you see, with him Mars is angered.
COLL. (aside, to himself).
May he be so indeed with your own heads!
ASSIST.
We are now bringing him here, Lycus, to you, for tearing asunderl.
COLL. (aside, to himself).
This huntsman, myself, will be going home to-day with some spoil;
the dogs are cleverly driving Lycus into the toils.
LYC.
Who is this person ?
ASSIST.
We really don't know who he is, except that some time since, after daybreak, when we went down to the harbour, at the same moment we saw him lauding from a merchant-ship.
Disembarking, he came up to us at once-he saluted us ;
we answered him.
COLL. (aside).
The artful fellows!
how cleverly they do enter upon the plot!
LYC.
What after that ?
ASSIST.
Then he joined in dis­ course with us:
he said that he was a foreigner, unacquainted with this city:
that he wanted a convenient place to be found here, for him to indulge his appetite.
We brought the man to you;
if the Gods are favourable to you, it's an opportunity for you to ply your trade.
LYC.
Is he eager to that degree ?
ASSIST.
He has got gold.
LYC. (aside).
That booty is mine.
ASSIST.
He wishes to drink and wench.
LYC.
I'll find him a nice place.
ASSIST.
But still he wants to be quite private, in a quiet way, that no persons may know it, and that there may be no overlookers;
for he has been a soldier in Sparta, as, indeed, he himself has told us, with King Attalus1;
from there he fled hither, when the town was surrendered.
COLL. (aside).
Very clever that, about the soldier!
about Sparta, most capital!
LYC. (in a low voice).
May the Gods and Goddesses bestow many blessings on you, for having given me kindly informa­ tion, and finding me a choice prey.
ASSIST.
Aye, and, as he himself has told us, that you may receive him the better, he has brought three hundred Philip­ pean pieces as a provision.
LYC.
I'm a king if I can to-day entice this man to my house.
ASSIST.
Nay but, he really is your own.
LYC.
By my troth, prithee, do persuade him to take up his abode at my house, as the best lodging.
ASSIST.
It befit us neither to persuade nor to dissuade a person who is a foreigner ;
you'll transact your own business, if you are prudent.
We have brought the ringdove for you, even to the trapping-ground;
now it's better for yourself to catch him, if you wish him to be caught.
(They move as if going.)LYC.
Are you going now ?COLL. (to the ASSISTANTS).
What about the matters that I commissioned you upon, strangers ?
ASSIST.
(pointing to LYcus).
It's better for you, young sir, to speak to him about your own concerns ;
he's clever in those matters which you are enquiring about.
COLL. (aside).
But, for my part, I could like you to see when I deliver him the gold.
ASSIST. (aside).
At a distance there we shall be witnesses of that.
COLL. (to the ASSISTANTS).
You've given me kind assist­ ance.
(The ASSISTANTS go out of sight.)LYC. (aside, so as to be heard).
The profit comes to me.
COLL. (aside, to himself).
Aye, just so, indeed, the way that the ass kicks1 with his heels.
LYC.
I'll speak the fellow fairly.
(To COLLYBISCUS.)
A stranger salutes a stranger ;
I'm glad that you have arrived in safety.
COLL.
May the Deities grant you many blessings, since you wish me well.
LYC.
They say that you are in search of a lodging.
COLL.
I am in search.
LYC.
So those persons told me, who left me just now, that you are in search of one that is free from flies.
COLL.
By no means in the world.
LYC.
Why so ?
COLL.
Because if I had been looking for a retreat from the flies2, on arriving here 1 should have straightway gone to gaol.
I'm in search of this kind of lodging, where I may be treated more delicately than the eyes of King An­ tiochus3 are in the habit of being treated.
LYC.
Upon my faith, for sure, I can provide you a charm­ ing one, if, indeed, you can put up with yourself being in a charming room, on a couch charmingly laid, a charming dam­ sel cuddling you.
COLL.
You are in the right road, Procurer.
LYC.
Where, with Leucadian, Lesbian, Thasian, and Coan wine1, toothless with old age2, you may soak yourself.
There I'll quite drench you with the effusion of unguents.
Why many words ?
I'll cause, when you've bathed, the bath­ keeper to set up unguent-shop there.
But (speaking confi­ dentially) all these things that I have mentioned let out their services for pay.
COLL.
Why so ?
LYC.
Because they demand ready money.
COLL.
Why, upon my faith, you are not more ready to re­ ceive than I to give.
LYC.
Why then follow me in-doors.
COLL.
Lead me in-doors, then;
you've got me devoted to your will.
( The ASSISTANTS come forward.
LYCUS and COLLYBISCUS go apart.)ASSIST. (among themselves).
What if we call Agorastoclos hither out of doors, that he himself may be his own witness, past all exception ?
(They go to the door of AGORASTOCLES and call out, in a loud whisper.)
Hallo !
you that are to catch the thief, come out quickly, that you yourself may witness him giving the gold to the Procurer.
SCENE IV.
—Enter AGORASTOCLES, in haste, from his house.
AGO.
What's the matter?
What is it you want, wit­ nesses ?
ASSIST.
Look to the right hand;
your servant is paying gold to the Procurer himself.
COLL. (apart to Lycus).
Come, take this, will you:
here are three hundred gold coins, counted out, which are called Philippeans.
(Gives him the bag.)
With these do you pro­ vide for me.
I wish these to be spent with all speed.
Lie.
By my troth, you have found a lavish steward for yourself.
Come, let's away in-doors.
COLL.
I follow you.
LYC.
Well, well, walk on;
and then we'll talk together about the other matters that remain.
COLL.
As for me, I'll tell you about the Spartan affairs.
LYC.
Why then follow me.
COLL.
Lead me in-doors;
lead me in, you have got me made over to you.
(They go into the house of LYCUS.)AGO.
What do you advise me now ?
ASSIST.
To be moderate.
AGO.
What if my feelings will not let me be PASSIST.
Then be as they will let you.
AGo.
Did you see it, when the Procurer received the money?
ASSIST.
We saw it.
AGO.
Did you know that he is my slave ?
ASSIST.
We knew it.
AGO.
That it is a thing against the reiterated laws of the people ?
ASSIST.
We knew it.
AGO.
Well then, all these things I wish you to keep in memory before the Prætor by-and-by, when occasion shall come.
ASSIST.
We remember them.
AGO.
What if, while the matter has so recently happened, I knock at the door ?
ASSIST.
I think you ought.
AGO.
If I do knock, he won't open it1.
ASSIST.
Then break the pannel2.AGO.
If the Procurer comes out, do you think I ought to enquire of the fellow whether my slave has come to him or not ?
ASSIST.
Why not ?
AGO.
With two hundred golden Philippean pieces ?
ASSIST.
Why not ?
AGO.
Then the Procurer will be going astray at once.
ASSIST.
About what matter ?
AGO.
Do you ask ?
Because a less sum will be named by one hundred pieces.
ASSIST.
You judge rightly.
AGO.
He'll think that some other person is being looked after.
ASSIST.
No doubt.
AGO.
He'll be denying it at once.
ASSIST.
On his oath even.
AGO.
The fellow will involve himself in the guilt of theftASSIST.
Beyond a doubt, it certainly is so.
AGO.
Of however much it is that shall have been brough to him.
ASSIST.
Why not?
AGO.
Jupiter confound you1!
ASSIST.
Why not your own self?
AGO. (going towards the door of LYCUS).
I'll go and knock at this door.
ASSIST.
Even so.
Why not P AGO.
It's time to be quiet, for the door makes a noise.
I see the Procurer Lycus coming out of doors;
come this way, pray!
ASSIST.
Why not ?
But, if you please, cover up our heads, that the Procurer mayn't know us, who have been his de­ coyers2 into so great a calamity.
(He throws the lappets of their garments over their heads.)LYC. (to himself).
Let all soothsayers go bang themselves now at once.
Why should I believe them in future, as to what they say ?
For they, just now at the sacrifice, told me that evil and the greatest disaster was portended to me.
1 have since then amplified my fortune with profit.
AGO.
(accosting him).
Save you, Procurer.
LYC.
May the Gods bless you, Agorastocles.
AGO.
You now salute me more kindly than hitherto.
LYC.
A calm has come, as though to a ship at sea.
Just as the wind is, to that quarter is the sail shifted.
AGO.
May those ladies be well in your house, to whom I wish it, but to yourself I do not wish it.
LYC.
They are well, as you desire;
not for you, though.
AGO.
Send your Adelphasium to my house, to-day, please, upon this celebrated and famous festival, the Aphrodisia.
LYC.
Have you been breakfasting on a hot breakfast to- day ?
Tell me.
AGO.
Why so ?
LYC
Because now you are only cool­ ing your mouth3, when you ask me.
AGO.
Attend to this, Procurer, will you;
I've heard that my slave is at your house.
Lie.
At my house ?
You'll find that has never been the fact.
AGO.
You lie;
for he has come to your house, and car­ ried off some gold there.
Word has been brought me to that effect, by persons I fully believe.
(Pointing to the ASSISTANTS.)LYC.
You are an artful fellow :
you've come to entrap me with your witnesses.
There's no one of your people in my house, nor anything of yours.
AGO. (turning round to the ASSISTANTS).
Remember that, assistants.
ASSIST.
We will remember it.
Lie. (laughing).
Ha, ha, ha!
I now understand how it is.
I've this instant seen through it.
These persons, who a short time since introduced that Spartan stranger to me, their brain is now fired at it, because I'm going to make a gain of these three hundred Philippean pieces ;
now, because they knew that this person was an enemy of mine, they have set him on to say that his slave, together with his gold, is in my house.
It's a planned contrivance for them to deprive me of it, and to divide it among themselves.
They are wanting to get away the lamb from the wolf1.
They are wasting their pains.
AGO.
What, do you deny that either the gold or my slave is at your house ?
Lie.
I do deny it;
and, if it's of any use, I make myself hoarse with denying it.
ASSIST.
You are undone, Procurer;
for that person whom we told you was a Spartan, is his bailiff;
who brought you just now the three hundred Philippean pieces;
and that same gold, too, is in his purse.
Lie. (shaking hisfist at them).
Woe unto you!
ASSIST.
That, indeed, is close at hand for yourself.
AGO.
Come, you hang-dog, give up the purse this instant.
You are clearly a thief, caught by me in the fact.
(To the ASSISTANTS.)
By my troth, I do beg of you, lend me your aid, so as to see me bring my slave out of his house.
(Hc voes into the PROCURER'S house.)
Lie.
I' faith, I'm now undone for certain, beyond a doubt!
This has been done on purpose that a snare might be laid for me.
But why do I hesitate to betake me hence to utter perdition, before I'm dragged off to the Prætor by the throat?
Alas!
what soothsayers I've been having for my diviners, who, if they promise anything that's fair, it comes to pass but slowly;
that which they promise as unfortunate, comes directly.
Now I'll be off:
I'll consult my friends in what way-they deem it best in especial for me to hang myself.
(Exit.AGO.
Be off you, get out you, that the witnesses may see you coming out from here.
Isn't this my servant ?
(To the ASSISTANTS.)COLL.
I' faith, I really am, Agorastocles.
AGO.
How now, villanous Procurer ?
ASSIST.
He, with whom you have the dispute, has made off.
AGO.
I hope he's gone hence to utter perdition.
ASSIST.
It's proper that we should wish the same.
AGO.
To-morrow I'll bring my action against the fellow.
COLL.
Anything further with me ?
AGo.
You may go;
put on your own dress.
COLL.
It wasn't for nothing that I turned soldier.
I made a little booty in-doors.
While the household of the Procurer was asleep, I got myself well filled with the entrails.
I'll be off from here in-doors.
AGO. (to the ASSISTANTS).
'Twas kindly done by you.
Assistants, you have lent me your good services.
To-mor­ row morning I beg you'll meet me at the court of justice.
(To COLLYBISCUS.)
Do you follow me in-doors.
(To the ASSISTANTS.)
To you, farewell!
ASSIST.
And you, farewell!
(AGORASTOCLES goes into his house, followed by COLLYBISCUS.)
This fellow wants a thing that's notoriously unfair;
he thinks that we are to serve him at our own expense.
But such are all these rich people of ours:
if you do anything of service, their thanks are lighter than a feather;
if there's any offence, they show vengeance like lead.
Let's now go to our houses, if you like, forthwith, since we've effected that for which we lent our services, to ruin this corrupter of our fellow-citizens.
(Exeunt.
MIL.
I'm awaiting in what way my plot is to proceed.
I'm bent upon ruining this Procurer, since he torments my afflicted master;
but he in his turn beats me, and strikes me with his fist and heels.
It's a misery to be in the service of one who is in love, especially one who is debarred from the object which he woos.
Heyday!
I see Syncerastus, the Pro­ curer's servant, betaking himself from the Temple.
I'll listen to what he has to say.
(-He stands aside.)SYN. (to himself)
It's quite clear that Gods and men neglect the benefit of him who has a master like a person of such character as I have for a master.
There's not an­ other person anywhere in the world more perjured or more wicked than is my master, nor one so filthy or so defiled with dirt.
So may the Gods bless me, I'd rather pass my life either in the stone quarries or at the mill, with my sides hampered with heavy irons, than pass this servitude with a Procurer.
What a race this is!
What corruptors of men they are!
Ye Gods, by our hopes in you, every kind of men you may see there, just as though you had come to Acheron -horse and foot, a freed-man, a thief, or a runaway, if you choose, one whipped, chained, or condemned to slavery.
He who has got money to pay, whatever sort of person he is-all kinds are taken in;
throughout all the house, in consequence, are darkened spots and hiding-places:
drinking and eating are going on, just as though in a cookshop, and in no less degree.
There may you see epistles written in letters in­ ribed on potteryl, and sealed with pitch:
the names are upon them in letters a cubit long;
such a perfect levy or vintners1 have we got at our house.
MIL. (apart).
Upon my faith, it is quite wonderful, if his master doesn't make him his heir;
for really, the way he soliloquizes, he's making a speech over him as though dead and gone.
I'd both like to accost the fellow, and yet I listen to him with extreme delight.
SYN. (to himself).
When I see these things going on, I'm vexed that slaves, purchased at the heaviest price, should at our house be robbed of the savings2 which ought to go to their masters.
But at last nothing is left visible:
" badly gotten, badly gone."MIL. (apart).
This man goes on talking quite as though he himself were an honest fellow, when, upon my faith, he himself is able to make worthlessness more worthless.
SYN. (to himself).
Now I'm taking home these vessels from the Temple of Venus, where with his sacrifice my master has not been able to propitiate Venus on her festive day.
MIL. (apart).
Charming Venus !SYN. (to himself).
But our Courtesans, with their first ictims, appeased Venus in an instant.
MIL. 0 charming Venus, once again!
SYN. (moving).
Now I'll go home,MIL. (coming forward).
Hallo!
Syncerastus!SYN. (looking around).
Who's calling Syncerastus ?
MIL.
Your friend.
SYN.
You don't act like a friend, in causing me delay when I've got a burden.
MIL.
But in return for this matter I'll lend you my aid, when you please, and when you give me your commands.
Consider the agreement signed.
SYN.
If so it is to be, I'll give you my services in thisMIL.
In what way ?
SYN, Why that, when I'm to havo a beating, you yourself may substitute your hide.
MIL.
Get along with you.
SYN.
I don't understand what sort of person you are.
MIL.
I'm good for nothing.
SYN.
Be so to yourself, then.
MIL.
I want you.
SYN.
But my burden is pressing me.
MIL.
Then, do you set it down, and turn your face to me.
SYN.
I'll do so, although I have no leisure.
(Puts down his load.)MIL.
Save you, Syncerastus.
SYN. 0 Milphio, may all the Gods and Goddesses favourMIL.
What person, pray ?
SYN.
Neither you, nor me, Milphio, nor my own master, in fact.
MIL.
Whom are they to favour, then PSYN.
Any one else they please;
for not one of us is de serving of it.
MIL.
You speak wittily.
SYN.
It befits me to do so.
MIL.
What are you doing ?
SYN.
I'm doing that which, clearly, adulterers don't generally do.
MIL.
What's that ?
SYN.
Bringing all off in safety1.
MIL.
May the Gods confound you and your master!
SYN.
May they not confound me.
I could make them ruin him, if I chose-ruin my master, did I not fear for myself, Milphio.
MIL.
What is it P Tell me.
SYN.
You are a bad one.
MIL.
I am a bad one.
SYN.
It goes but badly with me.
MIL.
Just tell me, then;
you ought to be in quite other plight.
Why is it that it goes badly with you, who have at home in superabundance what to eat, and what to drink ?
You don't give a single three-obol piece away to a mistress, and have her for nothing.
SYN.
May Jupiter so love meMIL.
I' faith, in the degree that you deserve, to wit.
SYN.
How I do long for this family to come to ruin.
MIL.
If you long for it, lend your aid.
SYN.
Without feathers it isn't easy to fly:
my wings have got no feathers.
MIL.
Troth, then, don't pluck out any hairs;
then, in the next two months, your arm-pits will be fit for flying.
SYN.
Away to utter perdition!
MIL.
Away yourself, and your master!
SYN.
But, really, if a person knew him well, the fellow might soon be mined.
MIL.
Why so ?
SYN.
* * * Just as though you could be silent on any matter.
MIL.
I'll keep the matter more strictly secret for you than that which has been told to a dumb woman.
SYN.
I could easily bring my mind to believe you there, if I did not know you.
MIL.
Trust me boldly at my own peril.
SYN.
I shall trust you to my cost, and still I will trust you.
MIL.
Don't you know that your master is a mortal enemy of my master ?
SYN.
I know it.
MIL.
By reason of the love affair ?
SYN.
You are losing all your pains.
MIL.
Why so ?
SYN.
Because you are teaching one that has been taught.
MIL.
Why, then, do you doubt that my master will do a mischief to your master with pleasure, so far as he can do, with his deserving it ?
Then besides, if you lend some assist- -trice, on that account he'll be able to do it the more easily.
SYN.
But I'm afraid of this, Milphio——MIL.
What is it that you're afraid of?
SYN.
That while I'm preparing the plot against my master, I may be betrayed by yourself.
If my master knows that I've been talking to any individual, he'll forthwith be making me from Syncerastus into Brokenlegs1.
MIL.
On my word, never shall any mortal be made the wiser by me;
only to my master alone will I tell it;
and to him, too, in such a way that he shall not disclose that this -matter originated in yourself.
SYN.
I shall trust you at my peril, and yet I will trust you.
But do you keep this a secret to yourself.
MIL.
To Faith herself it is not more safely confided.
Speak out boldly (there's room and opportunity);
we are here alone.
SYN.
If your master chooses to act with caution, he'll provo the ruin of my master.
MIL.
How can that be ?
SYN.
Easily.
MIL.
Then let me be acquainted with this " easily,’ that be may know it as well.
SYN.
Because Adelphasium, whom your master dotes on, is free by birth.
MIL.
In what way?
SYN.
In the same way that her other sister Anterastylis is.
MIL.
But how am I to believe that ?
SYN.
Because he bought them at Anactorium, when little children, of a Sicilian pirate.
MIL.
For how much ?
SYN.
For eighteen minæ.
MIL. (with an air of surprise).
These two for eighteen minæ1 ?
SYN.
And their nurse for the third.
He, too, who sold them told him that he was selling persons who had been kid­ napped:
he said that they were free-born, and from Carthage.
MIL.
Ye Gods, by our hopes in you!
you mention a most interesting matter;
for my master Agorastocles was born in the same place;
he was stolen thence when about six years old;
after that, the person who stole him brought him here and sold him to my master;
that person adopted him as heir to his wealth, when he departed this life.
SYN.
You mention everything that can render it the more easy;
let him assert their freedom, his own countrywomen, in an action on their freedom.
MIL.
Only do keep silence and hold your tongue.
SYN.
He certainly will bring the Procurer to a back­ gammon, if he gets them away.
MIL.
Nay but, I'll cause him to be ruined before he moves one foot2;
'tis so contrived already.
SYN.
May the Gods grant it so, that I don't continue the slave of this Procurer.
MIL.
On the contrary, upon my faith, I'll cause you to be a free man with myself, if the Gods are willing.
SYN.
May the Gods grant it so!
Do you detain me for anything else, Milphio ?
MIL.
Fare you well, and may happiness attend you.
SYN.
I' faith, that lies in the power of yourself and your master.
Farewell, and mind that these things have been told in secrecy.
MIL..
This has not been mentioned even.
Farewell.
SYN.
But really it's of no use, unless this is done while it is warm.
MIL.
You are right in your advice, and so it shall be done.
SYN.
There's excellent material, if you provide an excellent workman.
MIL.
Can't you hold your tongue PSYN.
I'll hold my tongue and be off.
MIL.
A grand opportunity you've made for me.
(SYN­ CERASTUS goes into the house of LYCUS.)
He's gone from here.
The immortal Gods do will my master to be preserved, and this Procurer utterly ruined;
a mischief so great is impend­ ing upon him.
Is it not the fact, before one weapon has been launched, then another presses upon him ?
I'll go in-doors, that I may recount these matters to my master.
For if I were to call him out hither before the house, and, what you've (to the AUDIENCE) just heard, if I were now here to repeat the same, it would be folly.
I'd rather in-doors be an annoyance to my master singly, than be so here to all of you.
Immortal Gods, what misfortunes, what great calamities do this day await this Procurer.
But now there's no reason why I should delay.
This business is resolved upon;
no pausing is allowed;
for both this must be cleverly managed, which has just now been entrusted to me, and that plan as well which was formed at home must be attended to.
If there's any delay, he who sends me a heavy mischance will be acting rightly.
Now I'll off in-doors;
until my master comes from the Forum, I'll wait at home.

(in a loud voice).
Do you say, Milphio, that Synce­ rastus told you that both of these women were freeborn, and stolen away from Carthage ?
MIL.
I do say so;
and if you were willing to act wisely, you'd at once assert their liberty by an action on their free­ dom.
For it's a disgrace to you for you to allow your own country-people to be slaves before your eyes, who were free women at home.
HAN.
(overhearing, apart).
0 ye immortal Gods, I do en­ treat your aid!
What speech is this that my ears devour!
Surely the words of these persons are made of chalk;
how have they cleansed away all the dark spots of woe from me !
AGO.
If you've got witnesses of this matter, I'll do as you bid me.
MIL.
Why speak you to me about witnesses ?
Why don't you stoutly insist upon it ?
Some way or other, Fortune will be your assistant.
AGO.
It's much more easy to begin a thing than to bring it about.
MIL. (catching sight of HANNO, attended by his SER­ VANTS).
But what bird is this1, pray, that's coming hither with the tunic on ?
Is he from the baths2, I wonder, enve­ loped in his cloak ?
I' faith, the countenance is surely Car­ thaginian.
The man's a Gugga3.
I' faith, he certainly has got some ancient and antiquated servants.
AGO.
How do you know?
MIL.
Don't you see the fellows folowing, loaded with luggage?
And, as I fancy, they've got no fingers on their hands.
AGO.
Why so ?
MIL.
Why, because they go with their rings in their ears1.
I'll approach them, and address them in the Punic language:
if they answer, I'll continue to speak in the Punic tongue if not, then I'll adapt my language to their usage.
How say you, do you still remember anything of the Punic lan­ guage ?
AGO.
Nothing at all, i' faith;
for tell me, how could I know, who was but six years old when I was stolen away from Car­ thage ?
HAN. (apart).
0 ye immortal Gods!
very many freeborn children have been lost from Carthage after this manner.
MIL.
How say you ?
AGo.
What do you want ?
MIL.
Should you like me to address this person in the Punic tongue ?
AGO.
Do you understand it ?
MIL.
No Punic man this day is a better Punic than I.AGO.
Go and address him, as to what he wants, why he's come, who he is, of what country, and whence he comes.
Don't be sparing of your questions.
MIL. (addressing HANNO and his SERVANTS).
Avo2!
Of what country are you, or from what city ?
AGO.
What does he say ?
MIL.
He says that he is Hanno from Carthage, a Cartha­ ginian, son of Muthumbal.
HAN.
Avo!
MIL.
He salutes us.
HAN.
Donni3.
MIL.
He intends to present you with some " donation" out of this;
what, I don't know.
Don't you hear him promise ?
AGO.
Salute him again in Punic, in my name.
MIL. (to HANNO).
" Avo donni" he tells me to say to you in his name.
(Pointing to AGORASTOCLES.)HAN.
Mehar bocca1!
MIL.
Be that for yourself rather than me!
AGO.
What does he say ?
MIL.
He declares that his " box" for his teeth is painful.
Perhaps he takes us to be doctors.
AGo.
If it is so, tell him that we are not;
I don't wish a stranger to be mistaken.
MIL. (to HANNO).
Hear you.
Rufen nuco istam2.
AGO.
This is my wish, that in fact everything should be ex­ plained to him just as it is.
Ask him whether he has need of anything.
MIL. (to HANNO).
You who have got no girdleS, why have you come to this city, or what is it you seek ?
HAN.
Muphursa4.
A GO.
What is it he says ?
HAN.
Moin lechianna6.
AGO.
Why has he come ?
MIL.
Don't you hear ?
He declares that he is wishful to give African mice to the Ædiles as a show at the games.
HAN.
Lalech lachananim liminichot6.
AGO.
What does he say now PMIL.
He says he has brought latchets, water-channels7, and nuts;
he's now begging that you'll lend him your assist­ ance in having them sold.
AGO.
He is a merchant, I suppose ?
HAN.
Is amar binaml.
AGO.
What is it he says ?
HAN.
Palum erga dectha2.
AGO.
Milphio, what is he saying now ?
MIL.
He says that he has got spades and forks3 given him for sale, for digging the garden and reaping the corn.
AGO.
What is that to me ?
MIL.
He wishes you to be informed ofit, so that you mayn't suppose that he has taken anything secretly and by stealth.
He has really, I do believe, been sent here to your harvesting.
HAN.
Muphonium sucoraim4.
MIL.
SO there!
do take care, please, how you do what he's begging of you.
AGO.
What is he saying, or what is he begging ?
Ex­ plain it.
MIL.
For you to order him to be placed beneath a hurdleS, and for many stones to be heaped upon it, so as to put him to death.
AGO.
Tell me what it is that he's saying.
MIL.
I' faith, now I really don't at all know.
HAN. (speaking in their own language).
But that you may know, now from this moment henceforth will I speak Latin.
(To MILPHIO.)
Upon my faith, you must be a worthless and bad servant, to be laughing at a person, a foreigner and a stranger.
MIL.
But, i' faith, at yourself a person that's both a swindler and a cheat, who have come here to take us in, you half­ and-half Lybian, you double-tongue, just like a crawling reptile.
AGO. (to MILPHIO).
Away hence with your abusiveness !
do restrain your tongue.
You'll keep it from uttering abuse, if you are prudent;
I don't want you to be speaking harshly to my kinsmen.
I was born at Carthage ;
do you remember that.
HAN.
0 my fellow-countryman, greetings to you!
AGO.
And you, troth, whoever you are;
and if you have need of anything, pray mention it, and command me for the sake of our common country.
HAN.
I return you thanks;
but I've got a place of enter­ tainment here;
I'm in search of the son of Antidamas;
do point me out Agorastocles, if you know him.
Do you know any young man here named Agorastocles ?
AGO.
If, indeed, you are in search of the adopted son of Antidamas, I am the very person whom you are in search of.
HAN. (starting).
Hah!
what's that I hear ?
AGo.
That I am the son of Antidamas.
HAN.
If so it is, if you would like to compare the token of hospitality1, see here, I've brought it.
(Shows him the ticket.)AGO.
Come then, show it here.
(He takes it in his hand, and looks at it.)
It is exactly true;
for I've got the counter­ part at home.
HAN.
0 my host, hail to you right earnestly;
for it was your father, then, Antidamas, that was my own and my father's guest;
this was my token of hospitality with him.
AGo.
Then here at my house shall hospitality be shown you;
for I don't reject either Hospitality or Carthage, from which I sprang.
HAN.
May the Gods grant you all you may desire.
How say you ?
How could it happen that you were born at Carthage, but had a father of Ætolia here ?
AGO.
I was stolen away from there;
this Antidamas, your guest, bought me, and adopted me as his son.
HAN.
He himself, likewise, was adopted by Demarchus.
But about him I say no more, and return to you.
Tell me, de you at all remember the names of your parents ?
AGO.
I remember my father and my mother's name.
HAN.
Repeat them, then, to me, to see if I know them, per­ chance, or if they are relatives of mine.
AGO.
Ampsigura was my mother, and lachon my father.
HAN.
I could wish that your father and mother were alive.
AGO.
Are they dead ?
HAN.
So it is, a thing which I bore with much grief;
for your mother Ampsigura was my cousin-german;
your father -he was my uncle's son, and when he died he made me his heir;
of whom being deprived by death, I am greatly affected.
But if it is the fact that you really are the son of Sachon, there ought to be a mark upon your left hand, a bite which an ape gave you when a child, playing with it.
Show it, that 1 may look at it;
open your hand.
AGO.
(opening his hand.)
Look, if you like;
see, there it is.
My kinsman, welcome to you!
HAN.
And welcome to you, Agorastocles!
I seem to my­ self to be born again, in having found you.
MIL.
By my troth, I'm delighted that this matter has fallen out so happily foryou.
(To HANNO.)
And would you decline to take advice PHAN.
Really, I should wish to be advised.
MIL.
His father's property ought to be restored to the son;
it's fair that he should have the property which his father possessed.
HAN.
I wish no otherwise;
everything shall be restored.
I'll give his own property to him all safe, when he comes there.
MIL.
Take care and restore it, will you, even though he should live here still.
HAN.
Nay but, he shall have my own as well, if anything should happen to me1.
MIL.
A pleasant project has just now come into my mind,HAN.
What's that ?
MIL.
There's need of your assistance.
HAN.
Tell me what you wish.
Really, you shall have my services just as you please.
What is the business ?
MIL.
Can you act the cheat ?
HAN.
Towards an enemy, I can;
to a friend, it would be mere folly.
MIL.
I' faith, it is an enemy of his.
(Pointing at AGO­ RASTOCLES.)HAN.
I could do him a mischief with pleasure.
MIL.
He's in love with a person who belongs to a Procurer.
HAN.
I deem that he acts discreetly.
MIL.
This Procurer lives close at hand.
HAN.
I could do him a mischief with pleasure.
MIL.
He has two slave girls, courtesans, sisters ;
one of these he is desperately in love with, nor has he ever takei any liberties with her.
HAN.
It's an unhappy kind of passion.
MIL.
The Procurer plays upon him.
HAN.
He's enhancing his own profits thereby.
MIL.
He wishes to do him an evil turn.
HAN.
He's right, if he does do it.
MIL.
Now I adopt this plan, and prepare this contrivance, that we should cite you;
you are to affirm that they are your daughters, and that they were stolen when little from Carthage, and to maintain the cause of both in an action on their freedom, as though they were both your own daughters.
Do you understand ?
HAN.
On my faith, I do understand;
for I likewise did have two daughters who were stolen away when little chil­ dren, together with their nurse.
MIL.
Upon my word, you do feign it cleverly.
At the very commencement this amuses me.
HAN. (aside, weeping).
Much more, i' troth, than I could, wish.
MIL.
(aside to AGORASTOCLES).
Dear me!
a subtle person, upon my word, artful and knowing, both tricky and crafty!
How he does whimper, in order that with his gestures he may effect this all the more easily.
Even myself, now, the master-workman, does he excel in skill.
HAN.
But their nursel, of what appearance was she ?
Tell me.
MIL.
Of stature not tall, of a dusky complexion2.
HAN.
'Tis the very person.
MIL.
Of agreable form, with, a small mouth, and very dark eyes.
HAN.
I' faith, you really have depicted her form exactly in your words.
MIL.
Should you like to see her ?
HAN.
I'd rather see my daughters.
Still, go and call her out of doors.
If they are my daughters, if she is their nurse, she'll recognize me at once.
MIL. (knocking at the door of the PROCURER’S house).
Hallo there!
is there any one here?
Tell Giddeneme to come out of doors;
there's a person wants to see her.
GID.
Who is it that knocks ?
MIL.
One that's a near acquaintance of yours.
GID.
What do you want ?
MIL.
Come now (pointing to HANNO), do you know that person in the tunic, who it is ?
GID.
Why, whom do I behold?
0 supreme Jupiter!
this sure is my master, the father of my foster-children, Hanno, the Carthaginian!
MIL.
Now, do see the cunning hussey !
this Carthaginian is really a clever juggler;
he has brought all over to his own opinion.
GriD. (running up to HANNO).
0 my master!
welcome to you, Hanno!
most unhoped for by myself and your daugh­ ters, welcome to you!
But look you, don't be wondering, or gazing so intently upon me.
Don't you know Giddeneme, your female slave ?
HAN.
I know her.
But where are my daughters?
That I’m longing to know.
GID.
At the Temple of Venusl.
HAN.
What are they doing there ?
Tell me.
GID.
To-day is the Aphrodisia, the festive day of Venus!
they have gone there to entreat the Goddess to be propitious to them.
MIL.
I' faith, they've fully prevailed, I'm sure, inasmuch as he has arrived here.
AGO. (aside to GIDDENEME).
How now, are these his daughters ?
GID.
Just as you say.
(To HANNO.)
Your kindness has clearly come to our rescue, in your having arrived here to-day at the very time;
for this day their names were to have beep changed1, and they were to have made a livelihood, disgraceful to their station, by their persons.
AGO.
What is it they are saying among them selves?
Tell me.
MIL.
He's saluting his mother, and she this her son.
HAN.
Hold your peace, and let alone the woman's gear.
MIL.
What gear is that ?
HAN.
Loud talking without limit.
(To MILPHIO.)
Do you lead these people in-doors (pointing to his SERVANTS), and bid this nurse to come away together with you to your house.
AGo. (to MILPHIO).
Do as he requests.
GID. (to HANNO).
But who's to point them out to you ?
AGO.
I will, right skilfully.
GID.
I'll go away then.
AGO.
I'd only rather that you would do so, than say so.
(She goes into the house of AGORASTOCLES.)MIL.
Upon my faith, I do think that this day the very thing that I said by way of joke will be coming to pass both soberly and seriously, that these will be discovered to-day to be his daughters.
AGO.
Troth, that very thing is quite certain now.
Do you, Milphio, take them (pointing to the SERVANTS) in-doors ;
we'll wait here for these damsels.
I wish a dinner to be got ready for my kinsman on his arrival.
MIL.
Lachananim4 you! (aside to the SERVANTS), whom I'll just now be packing off to the mill-stones, and from there after that to the dungeon and the oaken log5.
I'll give you reason to praise your treatment here but slightly.3 AGo. (to HANNO).
Do you hear, kinsman ?
I say, don't you revoke what has been said;
promise me your elder daugh­ ter in marriage.
HAN.
Consider the thing as agreed on.
AGO.
Do you promise her, then ?
HAN.
I do promise her.
AGO.
My kinsman, blessings on you!
for now you are mine beyond a doubt;
now at length shall I converse with her without restraint.
Now, kinsman, if you wish to see your daughters, follow me.
HAN.
Why, really, this long time I've been longing for it, and I'll follow you.
AGO.
What if we go and meet them ?
HAN.
But I'm afraid lest we should pass them on the road.
Great Jupiter, do now reinstate my fortunes for me as being certain instead of uncertain!
AGO.
I trust that my charmer will be my own.
But look, I catch sight of them.
HAN.
What, are these my daughters?
How tall from being such little creatures have they now become!
AGO.
Do you know how it is ?
These are Grecian columns1 ;
they are wont to be erect.
( They stand aside.)ADEL.
'Twas worth the while, to-day, of him who has a taste for loveliness to afford a feast to his eyes, in coming hither to the Temple this day to see the sights.
Upon my faith, I was charmed there to-day with the most elegant offerings of the courtesans, worthy of Venus, the most handsome Goddess;
nor did I despise her worship this day;
so great an abundance of beauteous objects was there there, each nicely arranged in its own place.
The odours of Arabia and of myrrh filled everything.
The festive day seemed to be affected with no gloom, Venus, nor did thy Temple;
so great a throng of her dependants was there, who had come to Venus of Calydon.
ANT.
But certainly, as far indeed as regarded us two, sister, we were all-powerful in our prayers, beauteous and gainers of her favour;
neither were we there held in ridicule by the young men, which, i' faith, sister, happened to all the rest.
ADEL.
I'd rather that it should so appear to other persons, than that you, sister, should praise yourself.
ANT.
Indeed, I trust so.
ADEI.
Troth, and so do I, when I reflect of what breeding we and the others are.
We were born in that station, that it befits us to be un­ blemished by faultiness.
HAN. (apart).
Jupiter, who dost preserve and feed the race of men, through whom we pass this mortal life, in whose hands are the hopes of life in all men, prithee, do grant this day as a prosperous one for my fortunes!
Those whom I've missed for many years, and whom when little I lost from their native land, to them restore their liberty, that I may be sure that for an indomitable sense of duty there is a reward.
AGO. (apart).
I'll engage that Jove shall do it all;
for to me he is indebted1, and stands in awe of me.
HAN. (apart).
Prithee, do hold your peace.
(He weeps.)AGO. (apart).
Kinsman, do not weep.
ANT. (apart).
As it is a pleasure for a man, my sister, if he succeeds in anything, to have the credit of victory, just so did we this day among the rest excel them all in beauty.
ADEL.
Sister, you are more silly than I could wish.
Prithee, do you really think yourself a beauty, if your face has not been besmeared with soot2 ?AGO. (apart).
0 kinsman!
0 kinsman, dearest of all kins­ men3 to me!
HAN. (apart).
What is it, son of my cousin?
My son, tell me, what is it you wish ?AGO. (apart).
Why, really, I do wish you to attend to thisJHAN. (apart).
Why, really, I am attending to it.
AGO. (apart).
Kinsman, kinsman, dearest of all kinsmen to me!
HAN. (apart).
What's the matter?
AGo. (apart).
She's a clever and a nice girl.
How shrewd she is !
HAN. (apart).
She has her father's disposition in being shrewd.
AGO. (apart).
How's that P This long time, i' faith, she has surely used up your shrewdness.
’Tis from here (pointing to himself) she now derives her shrewdness ;
'tis from here her sense;
whatever she does shrewdly, through my love does she act so shrewdly.
ADEL.
We are not born of that rank, although we are slaves, sister, that it should befit us to do anything which any man may laugh at.
Many are the faults of women;
but of the many, this one is the greatest, to please themselves too much, and to give their attention too little to pleasing the men.
ANT.
It was a very great delight that was portended in our sacrifice of the entrails, sister, and what the soothsayer said about us bothAGO. (apart).
I wish he bad said something about me !
ANT.
That we should be free in a few days, in spite of our owner.
I don't know why I should hope for that, unless the Gods or our parents do something.
AGO. (apart).
'Twas through confidence in me1, kinsman, upon my faith, that the soothsayer promised them liberty, I'm sure of it, because he knows I'm in love with her.
ADEL.
Sister, follow me this way.
(Moves as if going.)ANT.
1 follow.
(Moves also.)HAN. (stepping forward).
Before you go away2, I want you both.
Unless it's inconvenient, stop.
ADEL.
Who's calling us back?
AGO.
One who wishes to do you a kindness.
ADEL.
There's opportunity for doing it.
But who is the person?
AGO.
A friend of yours.
ADEL.
One who is not an enemy, in fact.
AGO.
This is a good man, my love.
ADEL.
I' faith, I should prefer him rather than a bad one.
AGO.
If, indeed, friendship must be engaged in, with such a person ought it to be engaged in.
ADEL.
I don't beg for it.
AGO.
He wishes to do you many services.
ADEL.
Being good yourself, you will be doing good to the good.
RAN.
I will cause you joyADEL.
And, i' faith, we pleasure to you.
HAN.
And liberty.
ADEL.
At that price you'll easily make us your own.
AGO.
My kinsman, so may the Gods bless me, if I were Jupiter, upon my faith I'd at once marry her for my wife, and pack Juno out of doors.
How quietly did she utter her words, how considerately and becomingly!
how modestly did she frame her speech!
certainly she is my own!
HAN. (apart to AGORASTOCLES).
But how skilfully I ac­ costed her!
A GO.
Cleverly and becomingly, upon my faith.
HAN.
Am I still to go on testing them ?
AGO.
Compress it in a few words;
the people who are sitting here are getting thirstyl.
HAN.
Well, why don't we proceed to do that which was to be done?
(To the WOMEN.)
I summon you to justice.
AGO.
Seize hold of this one, kinsman, if you are wise.
Should you like me to catch hold of her ?
ADEL.
Is this person your kinsman, Agorastocles ?AGO.
I'll soon let you know.
Now, by my word, I'll be nicely revenged on you;
for I'll make—you my bride.
HAN.
Come before a court of justice;
don't delay!
AGO.
Summon me as your witness2, and take me;
I'll be a witness for you;
and after that, her (pointing to ADEL­ PHASIUM) will I love and embrace.
But 'twas this, indeed, I intended to say-why yes, I did say that which I intended to say.
HAN. (to the DAMSELS).
You are lingering.
I summon you to justice, unless it is more becoming for you to be dragged thither.
ADEL.
Why do you summon us to justice?
What are we in your debt ?
AGo.
He'll tell it there.
ADEL.
Are even my own dogs barking at me ?
AGO.
Then, troth, do you caress me;
give me a kiss in place of a piece of meat;
present your lips in place of a bone1:
that way I'll render this dog more smooth for you than oil.
HAN.
Come on, if you are coming.
ADEL.
What have we done to you ?
HAN.
You are thieves, both of you.
ADIEL.
What, we, as regards you ?
HAN.
You, I say.
AGO.
And I know it.
ADEL.
What theft is this?
AGO.
Enquire of him.
HAN.
Because for many years you have been concealing my daughters from me, and, in fact, persons free-born, and free, and born of the highest rank.
ADEL.
I' faith, you'll never find that villany to have been committed by us.
AGo.
Make a bet of a kiss now, if you are not forsworn, which is to give it to the other.
ADEL.
I've nothing to do with you;
prithee, get you gone.
AGO.
But, i' faith, I've got something to do with you;
for he is my kinsman;
it's necessary for me to be his advo­ cate.
And I'll inform him how you are guilty of many a theft, and in what way you have got his daughters as slaves at your house, whom you know to be free women stolen from their native land.
ADEL.
Where are these, or who are they.
prithee ?AGO. (aside to HANNO).
They have been teased sufficiently.
HAN. (aside).
Why not speak out, then?
AGo. (aside).
I' faith, I'm of that opinion, kinsman.
ADEL.
I'm dreadfully afraid what this business can mean, my sister;
so astounded am I, I stand here without my senses.
HAN.
Damsels, give me your attention.
In the first place, if it could possibly come to pass, for the Gods not to send upon the innocent what is undeserved, that could I have wished to happen;
now for the good the Gods bestow upon me, upon yourselves and upon your nursel, 'tis due that we should give to the Deities our endless thanks, since the im­ mortal Gods approve and reward our piety.
You are my daughters, both of you, and this is your relation, Agorastocles, the son of my cousin.
ADEL.
Prithee, are they deluding us with imaginary joys ?
AGO.
Really, so may the Deities preserve me, this is your father.
Give him your hands.
ANT. (embracing him).
Welcome, father!
much wished and longed for!
We are both your daughters;
we both embrace you.
AGO.
Who'll be for embracing me in the next place ?
HAN.
Now am I happy !
Now with this delight do I allay the miseries of many a year.
ADEL.
We hardly seem to believe this.
HAN.
I'll tell you something to make you believe it the more:
why, it was your nurse who recognized me first.
ADEL.
Prithee, where is she ?HAN.
(pointing to AGORASTOCLES).
She's at his house.
AGO. (to ADELPHASIUM, who is embracing her father).
Pray, why does it please you to clasp his neck so long, before he has betrothed you to me P Dear one, much longed- for, blessings on you!
(He embraces her.)ADEL. (struggling).
Do leave off your salutations !
AGO.
I will leave off.
And you the other one.
(To AN­ TERASTYLIS, whom he embraces.)ANT. (struggling).
I don't want that;
you torment me to death!
HAlf.
Let us each clasp the other in our arms, than whom :
s there anything on earth more happy?
AGO.
Blessings befall the deserving.
(Pointing to HANNO.)
At last his wishes are realized!
0 Apelles! 0 Zeuxis2 the painter!
why did you die too soon?
Would that you could paint a subject after this!
For I don't care for other com­ mon painters to be treating subjects of this description.
HAN.
Gods and Goddesses all!
I return you deservedly extreme thanks, for having blest me with this gladness so supreme and with these joys so great;
as my daughters have returned to me and into my possession.
ADEL.
My father, your own piety has clearly come to our aid.
AGO.
Kinsman, take care and keep it in memory that you've betrothed your elder daughter to meHAN.
I remember it.
AGO.
The portion, too, that you promised.
ANTH. (to himself).
If I don't take full revenge for that mina which I gave to the Procurer, then really may the townspeople make a butt of me!
This most rascally fellow even brought me to his house to breakfast.
He himself went away out of doors, and left me as his chamberlainl in the house.
When neither the Procurer nor these women came back, nor anything was given me to eat, for the best part of the breakfast I took a pledge2, and came out of doors.
This way I'll pay him.
I'll touch up the rascally Procurer in the military way of payments.
He did get hold of a person for him to bamboozle out of a mina of silver !
But I wish that my mistress would now come in my way while thus enraged.
Then, by my troth, with my fists I'd make her quite black all over;
I'd cover her so with swarthiness, that she should be much more swarthy than the Egyptians, or than those who carry the buckets1 at the games in the Circus.
ADEL.
(running to AGORASTOCLES).
Do hold me fast, please, my love;
I sadly fear the kites;
this is an evil animal —lest perchance he may carry me off, your chick.
ANT. (embracing her FATHER).
I cannot clasp you fast enough, my father!
ANTH. (to himself).
I'm delaying.
(Looking in his hand.)
I can now pretty nearly cater a breakfast for myself with this.
(Raising his eyes.)
But what's this ?
How's this ?
What’s this ?
What's this I see ?
How now ?
What means this strange conjunction ?
What's this coupling together ?
Who's this fellow with the long skirts, just like a. tavern-boy ?
Do I quite see with my eyes ?
Isn't this my mistress, Anterastylis ?
Why, surely it is she.
For some time past I've perceived that I'm set at nought.
Isn't the girl ashamed to be hugging a tawny fellow in the middle of the street ?
I' faith, I shall give him up forthwith to the executioner to be tortured all over.
Surely this is a womanish race2, with their tunics hanging down to their heels.
But I'm determined to accost this African female lover.
(To HANNO.)
Hallo !
you woman, I say, are you not ashamed ?
What business have you with her, pray P Tell me.HA.N. Young man, greetings to you.
ANTH.
I don't want them;
that's nothing to you.
What business have you to touch her with a finger ?
HAN.
Because I choose.
ANTH.
You choose ?
HAN.
I say so.
ANTH.
Away to utter perdition, you shoe-latchet!
What, do you dare to be acting the lover here, you great toe of a man3, or to be meddling with an object which masculine men are fond of, you skinned pilchard, you deformed image of Serapis1, you half-apron, you sheepskin-jacket2, you pot of stinking sea- salt ;
more crammed, too, to boot, with leeks and garlick than the Roman rowers ?
AGO.
Young man, do your jaws or your teeth itch, that you are annoying this person, or are you in search of a heavy mishap ?
ANTH.
Why didn't you use a drums while you were saying that ?
For I take you to be more of an effeminate wretch than a real man.
AGO.
Do you understand what sort of effeminate wretch I am ?
(Calling aloud.)
Servants, come out of doors, bring out some cudgels!
,ANTH.
Hark you, if I have said anything in a joke, don't you be for taking it seriously.
ANT.
Prithee, what pleasure have you, Anthemonides, in speaking rudely to our kinsman and father ?
For this is our father ;
he has just now recognized us, and him as the son of his cousin.
ANTH.
So may Jupiter kindly bless me, I heartily rejoice that it is so, and I am delighted, if, in fact, any great misfor­ tuue befalls this Procurer, and since a fortune awaits you equal to your merits.
ANT.
I' faith, he says what's worthy of belief;
do believe him, my father.
HAN.
I do believe him.
AGo.
And I believe him.
But look (pointing), I espy the Procurer Lycus, the worthy fellow;
look, there he is­ he's betaking himself homeward.
HAN.
Who is this ?
AGO.
He's which you please, both the Procurer and Lycus.
He has been keeping your daughters in servitude, and from myself he has stolen some gold.
HAN.
A pretty fellow for you to be acquainted with!
AGO.
Let's bring him to justice.
HAN.
By no means.
AGo.
For what reason ?
HAN.
Because 'twere better for an action of damages to be brought against him1.
LYC. (to himself).
No one, in my opinion at least, is de­ ceived, who rightly states his case to his friends.
But by all my friends the one same thing is agreed upon, that I ought to hang myself, so as.
not to be adjudged to Agoras­ tocles.
AGO.
(stepping forward).
Procurer, let's away to the court of justice.
LYC.
I do entreat you, Agorastocles, that I may be at liberty to hang myself.
HAN.
I summon you to justice.
LYC.
But what have you to do with me ?
HAN.
(pointing at his DAUGHTERS).
Because I affirm that both of these are my daughters, free women, and free by birth, who, when little, were kidnapped together with their nurse.
LYC.
Indeed, I knew that already, and I wondered that no one came to assert their freedom;
they really are none of mine, indeed.
ANTH.
Procurer, you must come to justice.
LYC.
You are talking about the breakfast;
it is owing to you;
I'll give it.
AGO.
Twofold compensation I must have for the theft.
LTC. (pointing to his neck).
Take it out of this, then.
HAN.
And I require a full satisfaction.
LYC. (pointing to his neck).
Take out of this whatever you please.
ANTH.
And I, indeed, a mina of silver.
LYC. (pointing to his neck).
Take out of this whatever you please.
'I'll at once settle the matter for all with my neck, just like a porter.
AGO.
Do you refuse me in any way ?
LYC.
Not a word, in fact.
AGO.
Go in-doors, then, damsels.
But (to HANNO), my kinsman, betroth me your daughter, as you promised.
HAN.
I should not venture to do otherwise.
ANTH.
Kindly farewell!
AGO.
And kindly farewell to you!
ANTH.
(holding up what he has got in his hand).
Procurer, I take this as a pledge with me for my mina.
LYC.
By heavens, I am ruined!
AGo.
Why yes, before very long, when you've come to justice.
LYC.
Nay but, I own myself your slave.
What need of the Prætor have we ?
But I beseech you that I may be allowed to pay the simple sum1, three hundred Philippeans.
I think it can be scraped together;
to-morrow I'll have an auction.
AGO.
On condition, then, that you shall be in wooden cus­ tody at my house.
LYC.
So be it.
AGO.
Follow me in-doors, my kinsman, that we may keep this festive day in joyousness, upon his misfortune and our good fortune.
AUDIENCE).
Heartily fare you well.
To great length have we gone;
at last all these misfortunes fall upon the Procurer.
Now-that which is the last seasoning for our Play-if it has pleased you, our Comedy asks applause.
AGO.
What is it you are about, Captain ?
Why does it please you to speak rudely to my relative ?
Don't be sur­ prised that the damsels do follow after him;
he has just now discovered that both of them are his own daughters.
LYC. (starting).
Hah!
what speech was it that reached my ears ?
Now I am undone!
(To AGORASTOCLES.)
From what house were these females lost ?
AGO.
They are Carthaginians.
LYC.
Then I am ruined.
I was always in dread of that, lest some one should recognize them, a thing which has now come to pass.
Woe unto wretched me!
My eighteen minæ are lost, I guess, which I paid for them.
AGO.
And you yourself are lost, Lycus.HAN.
Who is this ?
AGO.
Which you please, he's either the Procurer or Lycus.
He has been keeping your daughters in servitude, and from myself he has stolen some gold.
HAN.
A pretty fellow for you to be acquainted with!
AGO.
Procurer, I always deemed you to be avaricious, but they know you to be a thief as well, who know more of you.
LYC.
I'll approach him.
(He falls on the ground before AGORASTOCLES.)
By your knees I do beseech you, and by him (pointing to HANNO), whom I understand to be your re­ lative ;
since you are deserving persons, as it befits deserving persons to do, do then come to the aid of your suppliant!
Indeed, already did I know them to be free women, and was waiting for some one to claim their freedom, for really they are none of mine.
Then besides, I'll restore your gold that I've got in my house, and I'll make oath that I have done nothing, Agorastocles, with ill intent.
AGO.
As it's right for me to do, I shall still consult my own notions.
Let go of my knees.
LYC.
I'll let them go, if such is your determination.
(He rises from the ground, and retires to a distance.)AGO.
Hark you!
Procurer.
LYC.
What do you want with a Procurer amid business ?
AGO.
You to restore me my money before I take you hence to be laid in fetters.
LYC.
May the Gods grant better things!
AGO.
Even so;
you'll be dining away from home.
I see.
Gold, silver, and your neck, Procurer, the three things are you now owing to me all at once.
HAN.
What it befits me to do in this matter, I'm consider­ ing with myself.
If I should attempt to take vengeance oil thisfellow, I shall be engaging in litigation in a strange city.
So far as I hear, his disposition and manners, of the nature that they areADEL.
My father, do have no dealings with this man, I conjure you.
ANT.
Do listen to my sister.
Come, put an end to your strife with the rascal.
HAN.
Attend to this, will you, Procurer.
Although I know that you deserve to come to ruin, I'll not try the matter with you.
AGO.
Nor I, if you restore me my gold;
- Procurer, when let go from the fetters—you may get thrust into prison.
LYC.
What, your old habit still ?
ANTH.
Carthaginian, I wish to excuse myself to you.
If I have said anything in my passion against the inclination of your feelings, J beg that you will pardon it;
and as you have found these daughters of yours, so may the Deities bless me, it is a pleasure to me.
HAN.
I both forgive and believe you.
ANTH.
Procurer, do you take care either to find me a mis­ tress, or return me the mina of gold.
LYC.
Should you like to have my music-girl PANTH.
I don't care for a music-girl;
you don't know which is the greater, their cheeks or their bosoms.
LYC.
I'll find one to please you.
ANTH.
Mind thatLYC.
(to AGORASTOCLES).

Yes, I'll follow you.

How say you, kinsman?
When are you thinking of leaving here for Carthage ?-for I'm deter­ mined to go together with you.

It's necessary for you to stop here some days, until I've had an auction.

Scene—Athens:
before the houses of PERIPHANES, APÆCIDES, and CHÆRIBULUS.THE plot of this Play is if an involved nature.
Periphanes, an aged Athenian, has a son, born in wedlock, named Stratippocles.
By Philippa, a woman of Epi­ daurus, whom he has formerly seduced, he has had a daughter, named Telestia who has been residing with her mother at Thebes.
A war arising between the Athenians and Thebans, Stratippocles, on setting out for the army, commis­ sions Epidicus, his father's servant, to purchase for him Acropolistis, a music- girl, of whom he is enamoured.
Epidicus, on this, persuades Periphanes that this girl is really his daughter by Philippa, whom he has not seen for many years, and that she has been taken captive at Thebes, and brought to Athens.
On this the old man gives Epidicus the requisite sum, and she is brought home and introduced to him as his daughter Telestis.
In the meantime, Stratippocles meets with another damsel who has been taken captive, and agrees with a Banker to borrow forty minæ, for the purpose of purchasing her.
He returns to Athens, and resolves not to meet his father until he has paid the money to the Banker and gained possession of the damsel, and Epidicus is threat­ ened by him with a severe punishment, if he does not manage to raise the sum required.
On this he accosts his aged master, and tells him that he must find a wife for his son, who is about to purchase a singing-girl of the name of Acropolistis.
The old man is persuaded to give a sum of money to Epidicus for the purpose of buying Acropolistis, that she may be kept out of the way of his son.
On receiving the money, Epidicus hands it over to Stratippocles, to be paid to the Banker.
The old gentleman having that morning ordered a singing-girl to be hired to perform at a sacrifice at his house, she is brought to him as Acropolistis, having been instructed how to play her part.
A Cap­ tain, who admires Acropolistis, having heard that Periphanes has purchased her, applies to him, and offers to give him a profit of ten minæ if he will trans­ fer her to him.
Periphanes, thereupon, brings to him the music-girl who is assuming that character (while the real Acropolistis is taken for his daughter), on which the Captain discovers the deception, and Periphanes finds out that the girl is already free, and has been only brought to his house to perform at the sacrifice.
At this conjuncture Philippa arrives, having heard that her daughter has been brought to Athens.
Periphanes meets her, and assures her that her daughter is safe at his house.
On this, Philippa is introduced to Acropolistis, and declares that she is not her daughter, and that Periphanes has been imposed upon.
On being questioned, Acropolistis COil­ esses that she has only called Peripbanes her father because he has called her his daughter.
Epidicus, on being discovered to be guilty of this second fraud upon his master, is greatly alarmed;
but just then he perceives the Banker, who has come for the money, leading the Theban captive.
He immediately recognizes her as Telestis, the real daughter of Periphanes and Philippa.
Stra­ tippocles, somewhat to his sorrow, is informed that the captive is his half-sister, and therefore, most probably, consoles himself with Acropolistis.
For making this discovery, Epidicus is not only pardoned by Periphanes, but receives his freedom.
AN old gentleman, thinking her his daughter, purchases (Emit) a music-girl, by the advice (Persuasu) of his servant, who, a second time (Iterum), substi­ tutes for him, in place of his son's mistress, another one hired;
he gives (Dat to his master's son the money;
with it the young man, not knowing it (Im­ prudens), purchases his sister.
Soon afterwards, by the aid of a woman whom he has seduced, and of a Captain, the old man understands (Cognoscit) that he has been imposed upon, as (Ut) the one is in search of his mistress, the other of her daughter.
But (Sed) on finding his daughter, he gives his servant his liberty.
EPID. (pulling THESPRIO by the cloak).
Harkye!
young man.
THES.
Who pulls me by the cloak, when thus in haste ?
EPID.
An intimate.
THES.
I confess it;
for with your annoyance you are too intimate.
EPID.
But do look back, Thesprio!
THES.
(looking round).
What ?
Is it Epidicus that I see ?
EPID.
Why surely you've the use of your eyes.
THES.
Greetings to you.
EPID.
May the Gods grant what you desire.
I'm glad that you've got here safe.
THES.
What besides ?
EPID.
According to the usage, a dinner shall be given you1.
THES.
I agree.
EPID.
What to do ?
THES.
That I'll accept it, if you offer it.
EPID.
How are you ?
Fare you as you could wish ?
THES.
The proof's before you.
EPID.
I understand.
(Eyeing him from top to toe.)
Marvellous!
You seem quite plump and hearty.
THES.
(pointing to his left hand).
Thanks to this.
EPID.
Which, indeed, you ought to have parted with2 long ago.
THES.
I'm less of a pilferer now than formerly.
EPID.
How so ?
TilES, I rob above-boards.
EPID.
May the immortal Gods confound you, with what huge strides you do walk!
for when I caught sight of you at the harbour, I began to run at a rapid pace;
I was hardly able to overtake you just now.
THES.
You are a town wit.
EPID.
I know that you, on the other hand, are a military gentleman.
THES.
Speak out as boldly as you please.
EPID.
How say you?
Have you been well all along?
TIlES.
In a varied way.
EPID.
Those who are well in varied way4, a race of men of the goat kind or of the panther kind, don't please me.
THES.
What do you wish me to tell you but that which is fact ?
EPID.
To answer to these things fairly;
how's our master's son ?
Is he well ?
THES.
Stout as a boxer and an athlete.
EPID.
You've brought me joyous tidings on your arrival.
But where is he ?
THES.
I came here together with him.
EPID.
Where is he then ?
Unless, perchance, you've brought him in your wallet, or, perhaps, in your knapsack.
THES.
May the Gods confound you!
EPID.
I want to make enquiries of you.
Lend me your attention;
attention shall be lent you in return.
THES.
You say what's lawl.
EPID.
It becomes me to do so.
THES.
But why now are you acting the Prætor over us ?
EPID.
What other person in Athens will you say is more deserving of it than I ?THES.
But still, Epidicus, one thing is wanting for your Prætorship.
EPID.
What, pray ?
THES.
You shall know;
two lictors2 two osier bundles of twigsEPID.
(shaking his fist at him).
Woe unto you!
But how say you ?
THES.
What is it you ask ?
EPID.
Where are the arms8 of Stratippocles ?
THES.
I' faith, they've gone over to the enemy.
EPID.
What, his arms ?
THES.
Aye, and quickly too.
EPID.
Do you say that seriously ?
THES.
Seriously I say it;
the enemy have got them.
EPID.
By my troth, a disgraceful affair.
THES.
Still, before now, other persons have done the same.
This affair will turn out to his honor4.
EPID.
How so ?
THES.
Because it has been so to others before.
EPID.
Mulciber, I suppose, made the arms which Stratip­ pocles had;
they flew over to the enemy1.
THES.
Why, then, e'en let this son of Thetis lose them;
the daughters of Nereus will bring him others.
EPID.
Only this must be looked to, that material may be found for the armourers, if in each campaign he yields a spoil to the enemy.
THES.
Have done now with these matters.
EPID.
You yourself make an end of them when you please.
THES.
Cease your enquiries then.
EPID.
Say, where is Stratippocles himself?
THES.
There is a reason, for which reason he has been afraid to come together with me.
EPID.
Pray, what is it ?
TIRES.
He doesn't wish to see his father as yet.
EPID.
For what reason ?
THES.
You shall hear;
because he has purchased out of the spoil a young female captive of charming and genteel figure.
EPID.
What is it I hear from you PTHES.
That which I'm telling you.
EPID.
Why has he purchased her PTHES.
To please his fancy.
EPID.
How many fancies has this man ?
For assuredly, before he went away from home to the army, he himself commissioned me, that a music-girl whom he was in love with should be purchased of a Procurer for him.
That I have managed to accomplish for him.
THES.
Whichever way the wind is at sea, Epidicus, in that direction the sail is shifted.
EPID.
Woe unto wretched me!
He has utterly undone meTHES.
What's the meaning of this ?
What's the matter, pray?
EPID.
Well now—she whom he has bought, at what sum has he purchased her PTHES.
A very little.
EPID.
That I don't ask you.
THES.
What then ?
EPID.
For how many minæ ?
THES.
(holding up all his fingers four times).
For so many.
EPID.
Forty minae THES.
For that purpose, he borrowed the money on interest of a Banker at Thebes, at a didrachm for each silver mina per day.
EPID.
Surprising!
THES.
This Banker, too, has come together with him, and is dunning for his money.
EPID. Immortal Gods!
now I'm fairly done forTHES.
Why so, or what's the matter, Epidicus PEPID.
He has proved my ruin!
THES.
Who?
EPID.
Who ?
He who lost his arms.
THES.
But why so ?
EPID.
Because he himself was every day sending me letters from the army-but I shall hold my tongue;
it's best to do so.
It's best for a man in servitude to know more than he says;
that's true wisdom.
THES.
On my faith, I don't understand why you are alarmed.
You are frightened, Epidicus ;
I see it by your countenance.
You seem here, in my absence, to have got into some scrape or other.
EPID.
Can't you cease annoying me PTHES.
I'll be off.
(Moves as if going.)EPID.
Stand still;
I'll not let you go from here.
(Holds him.)
THES.
Why do you hold me back ?
EPID.
Is he in love with her whom he has purchased out of the spoil ?
THES.
Do you ask me?
He dotes to death upon her.
EPID.
The hide will be stripped from off my back.
THES.
He loves her, too, more than ever he loved you.
EPID.
May Jupiter confound you!
THES.
Let me go now;
for he has forbidden me to go to our house;
he ordered me to come here (pointing to the house) to our neighbour's, Chæribulus;
there he bade me wait;
he's about to come there himself.
EPID.
Why so ?
THES.
I'll tell you ;
because he doesn't wish to meet with or see his father, before he has paid down this money which is owing for her.
EPID. 0 dear!
an involved business, i' faith.
TilEs.
Do let go of me, that I may now be off forthwith.
EPID.
When the old gentleman knows this, our ship will fairly founder.
THES.
What matters it to me in what way you come to your end ?
EPID.
Because I don't wish to perish alone;
I'd like you to perish with me, well-wisher with well-wisher.
THES. (tearing himself away from EPIDICUS).
Away with you from me to utter and extreme perdition with those terms of yours !
EPID.
Be off, then, if you are in great haste about any­ thing.
THES. (aside).
I never met with any person from whom I parted with greater pleasure.
( Goes into the house of CHÆ­ RIBULUS.)EPID. (to himself).
He's gone away from here;
you are now alone.
In what plight this matter is, you now see, Epi­ dicus.
Unless you have some resources in your own self, you are done for.
Ruination so great is impending over you—un­ less you support yourself stoutly, you cannot hold up;
to such a degree are mountains of misfortune threatening to tumble on you.
Neither does any plan just now please me by means of which to find myself disengaged from my entanglement.
To my misfortune, by my trickeries I have forced the old man to imagine that he was making purchase of his own daugh­ ter;
whereas he has bought for his own son a music-girl whom he was fond of, and whom on his departure he commissioned me about.
He now, to please his fancy, has brought another one from the army.
I've lost my hide, for when the old man finds out that he has been played tricks with, he'll be flaying my back with twigs.
But still, do you take all precautions.
(He stands still and thinks.)
That's of no use!
clearly this head of mine is addled!
You are a worthless fellow, Epi­ dicus.
(In another tone.)
What pleasure have you in being abusive ?
Because you are forsaking yourself.
What am J to do ?
Do you ask me the question ?
Why you yourself, in former days, were wont to lend advice to others.
Well, well;
something must be found out.
But why delay to go meet the young man, that I may know how the matter stands ?
And here he is himself.
He is in a grave mood.
He's coming with Chæribulus, his year's-mate.
I'll step aside here, whence at my leisure T'U follow their discourse.
(He steps aside.)STRAT.
I've told you all the matter, Chæribulus, and I have fully disclosed to you the sum of my griefs and loves.
CHÆR.
You are foolish, Stratippocles, beyond your age and lineage.
Does it shame you, because you have bought a cap­ tive girl, born of good family, from among the spoil?
Who will there be to impute it as a fault to you ?
STRAT.
Through doing this, I've found that those who are envious are all enemies to me ;
but I've never offered violence1 or criminal assault against her chastity.
CHIER.
Then, so far, in my opinion at least, you are a still more deserving man, inasmuch as you are temperate in your passion.
STRAT.
He effects nothing who consoles a desponding man with his words :
he is a friend, who, in dubious circum­ stances, aids in deed when deeds are necessary.
STRAT.
To lend me forty minæ of silver, to be paid to the Banker from whom I borrowed it on interest.
CHÆR.
On my word, if I had it, I would not deny you.
STRAT.
What then does it signify your being bounteous in talk, if all aid in the matter2 is dead outright.
CHÆR.
Why faith, I myself am quite wearied and dis­ tracted with being dunned.
STRAT.
I had rather my friends of that sort were thrust into a furnace than into litigation3.
But now I could wish to buy me the assistance of Epidicus at a weighty price, a fellow whom I'll hand over well-liquored with stripes to the bakery unless he this day finds me forty minæ before I've mentioned to him the last syllable of the sum.
EPID. (apart).
The matter's all right;
he promises well.
he'll keep faith, I trust.
(Ironically.)
Without any expen­ diture of my own, an entertainment, is already provided for my shoulder-blades.
I'll accost the man.
(-He goes up to STRATIPPOCLES.)
The servant Epidicus wishes health to his master Stratippocles, on his arrival from abroad.
STRAT. (turning round).
Where is he ?
EPID.
Here he is;
I'm delighted that you have returned safe.
STRAT.
I believe you as much in that as I do myself.
EPID.
Have you been well all along ?
STRAT.
I've been free from disease;
in mind I've been ailing.
EPID.
As regarded myself, I've taken care of what you entrusted to me;
it has been obtained;
the female captive has been bought, about which matter you were sending me letters so often.
jSTRAT.
You've lost all your labour.
EPID.
But why have I lost it ?
STRAT.
Because she is not dear to my heart, nor does she please me.
EPID.
What means it, then, that you gave me such strict injunctions, and sent letters to me PSTRAT.
Formerly I did love her;
but now another passion influences my heart.
EPID.
I' faith, it is a shocking thing for that to be unplea­ sant for a man which you have managed wellfor him;
whereI've done well, I've in reality done ill, since love has shifted sides.
STRAT.
I wasn't right in my mind when I sent those letters to you.
EPID.
Is it proper that I should be the atonement for your folly, so as for you to substitute my back as the scape-goat2 for your folly ?
STRAT.
Why are we making words about that ?
This man (pointing to himself) has need of forty minæ, ready money, and in all haste, for him to pay a Banker, and speedily too.
EPID.
Only tell me from what quarter you wish me to get them.
From what banker am I to seek them ?
STRAT.
From where you like.
But if I don't finger them before sunset, don't you enter my house;
off with yourself to the mill.
EPID.
You easily say that without risk and concern, and with a gay heart.
I know our floggers ;
I feel the pain when I'm beaten.
STRAT.
How say you now ?
Will you suffer me to de­ stroy myself ?
EPID.
Don't do that.
I'll cope with this peril and bold attempt in preference.
STRAT.
Now you please me;
now do I commend you.
EPID.
I'll submit to this in any way that's pleasing to you.
STRAT.
What then is to be done about this music-girl ?
EPID.
Some method shall be found out;
by some means I'll disengage myself;
some way I shall get extricated.
STRAT.
You are full of scheming;
I know you of old.
EPID.
There is a rich Captain of Eubœ1, abounding in plenty of gold, who, when he knows that that one was bought for you, and that this other one has been brought here, will forthwith be entreating you, of his own accord, to transfer that other one to him.
But where is she whom you have brought with you ?
STRAT.
I shall have her here just now.
CHÆR.
What are we now doing here ?
STRAT.
Let's go in-doors here at your house, that, for the present, we may pass this day merrily.
(They go into the house of CHÆRIBULUS.)EPID. (to himself).
Go in-doors ;
I'll now call2 a council in my heart to adopt measures about this money business, against whom, in especial, war is to be declared, and out of whom I'm to get the money.
Epidicus, consider what you are to do ;
thus suddenly has this business been thrown upon you.
But now you must not be slumbering, nor have you any leisure for delay.
Now must you be daring!
'Tis my fixed determination to lay siege to the old man.
I'll go in- doors ;
I'll tell the young man, my master's son, not to walk abroad here, or come anywhere in the way of the old gentle­ man.
(Goes into the house of CHÆRIBULUS.)Ap.
Mostly all men1 are ashamed when they have no occa­ sion to be;
when they ought to be ashamed, then does shame forsake them, when there's a necessity for their being ashamed.
That man, in fact, are you.
What is there to be ashamed of in your bringing home a wife, poor, but born of good family ?
Especially her, whose daughter you say this girl is, who is at your house ?
PERI.
I have some regard for my son2.
AP.
But, i' faith, the wife whom you buried I thought you had felt some respect for;
whose tomb as oft as you see, you straightway sacrifice victims to Orcus;
and not without reason, in fact, since you've been allowed to get the better of her by surviving her.
PERI.
Ah me!
I was a Hercules while she was with me;
and, upon my faith, the sixth labourS was not more difficult to Hercules than the one that fell to my lot.
AP.
I' faith, money's a handsome dowry.
PERI.
Troth, so it is, which isn't encumbered with a wife.
EPID. (at the door, as he enters).
Hist!
hist be silent, and have good courage;
with a fair omen have I come out of doors, the bird upon the left hand1.
(Pointing to his head.)
I've got a sharp knife, with which to embowel the old man's purse;
but see!
here he is before the house of Apæcides, the two old fellows, just as I want.
Now I shall change me into a leech, and suck out the blood of these who are called the pillars of the Senate.
PERI.
Let him be married at once.
AP.
I approve of your design.
PERI.
For I've heard that he's entangled with love with a certain music-girl, I don't know who.
At that I'm vexed to death.
EPID. (apart).
By my troth, all the Deities do aid, amplify, and love me;
really, these men themselves are pointing out to me the way by means of which I'm to get the money out of them.
Now then, come, equip yourself, Epidicus, and throw your cloak about your neck (suiting the action to the word), and pretend as though you had been in search of the man all the city over.
On with it, if you are going to do it!
(-He hurries past the OLD MEN as though he didn't see them, and calls out aloud.)
Immortal Gods!
I do wish I could meet with Periphanes at home, whom I'm tired with search­ ing for all over the city, throughout the doctors' shops, throughout the barbers' shops, in the gymnasium, and in the Forum, at the perfumers' shops and the butchers' stalls2, and round about the bankers' shops.
I'm become hoarse with enquiring;
I've almost dropped down with running.
PERI.
Epidicus!
EPID. (looking round).
Who is it that's calling Epidicus back ?
PERI.
It's I, Periphanes.
Ap. And I, Apæcides.
EPID.
And I, indeed, am Epidicus.
But, master, I find that you've both met me at the nick of time.
PERI.
What's the matter P EPID.
Wait, wait! (puffs ana bloics);
prithee, do let me get breath!
PERI.
By all means, rest yourself.
EPID.
I'm quite faint;
I must recover my breath.
Ap.
Do rest yourself at your leisure.
EPID.
Lend me your attention.
All the men of the army have been remanded home from Thebes1.
Ap.
Who knows for certain that this has been done PEPID.
I say that it has been done.
PERI.
Are you sure of that P EPID.
I am sure of it.
PERI.
Why are you sure of it PEPID.
Because I've seen the soldiers marching through the streets in shoals.
They are bringing back their arms and their baggage-horses.
PERI.
Very good indeed!
EPID.
Then, what prisoners they've got with them!
boys, girls, in twos and threes;
another one has got five ;
there's a crowd in the streets;
they are looking out each for his son.
PERI.
I' troth, a business very well managed!
EPID.
Then, fully as many of the courtesans as there are in the whole city were going decked out each to meet her lover;
they were going to trap them;
that's the fact, inasmuch as I gave especial attention to it;
several of these nad with them nets beneath their garments.
When 1 came to the harbour, forthwith I espied her waiting there, and with her were four music-girls.
PERI.
With whom, Epidicus ?
EPID.
With her whom your son has been loving and doting on for years, with whom he's making all haste to ruin credit, property, himself, and yourself.
She was on the look- out for him at the harbour.
PERI.
Just see the sorceress now!
EPID.
But decked out, sparkling with gold, and adorned so splendidly!
so nicely!
so fashionably!
PERI.
What was she drest in ?
Was it a royal robe, or was it a plain dress ?
EPID.
A skylight one2, according as these women coin names for garments.
PERI.
What!
was she dressed in a skylight ?
EPID.
What's there wonderful in that ?
As though many women didn't go through the streets decked out with farma upon them.
But when the tax is demanded, they declare it cannot be paid1;
while to these hussies, to whom a larger tax is paid, it can be paid.
Why, what new names every year these women are finding for their clothing-the thin tunic, the thick tunic, your fulled linen cloth, chemises, bor­ dered shifts, the marigold or saffron-coloured dress, the under­ petticoat or else the light vermilion dress, the hood, the royal or the foreign robe, the wave pattern!!
or the feather- pattern, the wax or the apple-tint.
The greatest nonsense!
From dogs, too, do they even take the names.
PERI.
How so ?
EPID.
They call one the Laconians.
These names compel men to make auctions.
PERI.
But do you say on as you commenced.
EPID.
Two other women behind me began to speak thus between themselves;
I, like my wont, went away a little distance from them;
I pretended that I wasn't attending to their talk:
I didn't quite hear all, and still I wasn't deceives in a word they said.
PERI.
I long to hear it.
EPID.
Then one of them said to the other with whom she was talkingEPID.
Be quiet then, that you may hear.
After they had caught sight of her whom your son is dying for:
" Prithee, how happily and luckily has it befallen that woman for her lover to be wishing to set her free." " Who is he ?" said the other.
She mentioned Stratippocles.
PERI.
Troth now, I'm undone;
what is it I hear of you ?
EPID.
That which really took place.
After this, I myself, when I heard them talking, began again to draw closer towards them little by little, as though the crowd of people was pushing me, whether I would or no.
PERI.
I understand.
EPID.
Then the one asked the other, " How do you know?" " Why, because a letter has been brought her to-day from Stratippocles;
that he has borrowed money on interest from a banker at Thebes;
that it is ready, and he himself has brought it for that purpose."
PERI.
Tell on—I'm undone!
EPID.
She said that she had heard so from her and from the letter which sAe had seen.
PERI.
What am I to do now ?
I ask your advice, Apæcides.
AP.
Let us find some clever, useful expedient;
for he, indeed, will either be here just now, or is here already.
EPID.
If it were right for me to be wiser than you, I could give you some good advice, which you will praise, I fancy, both of youPERI.
Then where is it, Epidicus ?
EPID.
Yes, and useful for this purpose.
AP.
Why do you hesitate to mention it ?
EPTD.
It's proper for yourselves, who are the wiser, to be the first to speak, and for me to speak afterwards.
PERI.
Aye, aye, of course-come, say on.
EPID.
But you'll laugh at me.
AP.
On my word, we will not do so.
EPID.
Well then, if it pleases you, use my advice;
if it doesn't please you, find better.
There's neither sowing nor reaping1 for me in this matter;
only that I do wish the same that you wish.
PERI.
I return you thanks.
Make us partakers in your wisdom.
EPID.
Let a wife at once be chosen for your son;
and so take vengeance on this music-girl whom he wants to liberate, and who is corrupting him for you;
and so let it be managed, that even until her dying day she may remain a slave.
Ap.
It ought to be so managed.
PERI.
I am ready to do anything, so long only as this may be brought aboutEPID.
Well then, now there's an opportunity of doing so, before he comes into the city, as to-morrow he will be here;
to-day he will not have come.
EPID.
I do know, because another person told me, who came from there, that he would be here in the morning.
PERI.
Then say you what we are to do.
EPID.
I'm of opinion that you ought to do thus:
you must pretend as though you were desirous to give her liberty to the music-girl for your own whim, and as though you were violently in love with her.
PERI.
To what advantage does that tend ?
EPID.
Do you ask that ?
Why, that you may purchase her beforehand with money, before your son comes, and may say that you bought her to set her at libertyPERI.
I understand.
EPID.
When she's bought, you must remove her somewhere out of the city;
unless your own feel­ ings are any way opposed.
PERI. 0 no, skilfully suggested.
EPID.
But what say you, Apæcides ?
Ap.
Why, what should I ?
Except that I think you've contrived it very cleverly.
EPID.
Then, in consequence, all thoughts of marriage with her will be removed from him, so that he will make no diffi­ culties as to what you wish.
AP.
Long life to you, wise as you are, it really does please us.
EPID.
Do you then skilfully do whatever you are going to do.
PERI.
I' faith, you speak to the purpose.
EPID.
I have found, too, how this suspicion may be re­ moved from yourself.
PERI.
Let me know it.
EPID.
You shall know it;
just listen.
A?.
He's come with a breast full of counsel.
EPID.
There's need of a person to carry the money there for the music-girl;
but there's no equal necessity for your­ self to do it.
PERI.
Why so?
EPID.
Lest he should think you are doing it for the sake of your sonPERI.
Cleverly thought of!
EPID.
By which means you'll keep him away from her;
lest any difficulty might arise by reason of that suspicion.
PERI.
What person shall we find suited to this purpose ?
EPID. (pointing to APÆCIDES.)
He will be the best;
he will be able to take all due precautions, as he understands the laws and ordinances.
PERI.
Epidicus, receive my thanks.
But I'll attend to this with all care.
EPID.
I'll find him and bring him here to you, to whom the music-girl belongs;
and I'll take the money along with him.
(Pointing to APÆCIDES.)PERI.
For how much, at the lowest, can she be bought ?
EPID.
What, she ?
Perhaps she might possibly be bought at the lowest for forty minæ;
but if you give me more, I shall return it.
There's no trickery in this matter.
This money, too, of yours won't be locked up ten days.
PERI.
How so?
EPID.
Why, because another young man is dying with love for this woman, one abounding in money, a great warrior, a Rhodian, a spoiler of his foes1, a boaster;
he'll buy her of you, and give the money with plea­ sure.
You only do it;
there's a large profit for you here.
PERI.
I really pray the Gods it may be so.
EPID.
You'll obtain your prayer.
AP.
Why then, don't you go in-doors and bring the money out here P I'll go visit the Forum.
Epidicus, do you come thither.
EPID. (to APÆCIDES).
Don't you go away from there before I come to you.
AP.
I'll wait till then.
PERI, (to EPIDICUS).
Do you follow me in-doors.
EPID.
Go and count it out;
l'It not detain you at all.
Exit APÆCIDES, and PERIPHANES goes into his house.)EPID. (to himself).
I do think that in the Attic land there is no spot of land so fertile as is this Periphanes of ours;
why, from the locked and sealed-up money-chest I summon forth silver just as much as I please.
But this, i' troth, I am afraid of, that if the old man should come to know it, he'll be making parasites of elm-twigs1, to be shaving me quite clean.
But one matter and consideration disturbs me—what music-girl, one that goes out on hire, I'm to show to Apæcides.
(He muses.)
And that as well I've got:
this morning the old gentleman bade me bring for him on hire some music-girl to his house here, to sing for him while he was performing a sacrifice2.
She shall be hired, and be instructed beforehand in what way she's to prove herself cunning towards the old man.
I'll away in-doors;
I'll get the money out of the swindled old fellow.
(He goes into the house of PERIPHANES.)STRAT.
I'm distractedly in suspense and worn to the heart with waiting how the fair promises of Epidicus will turn out for me.
I've been tormented too long.
Whether there is to be anything, or whether there is not, I wish to know.
CHÆR.
For all these resources you may still seek some other resources for yourself.
For my part, I knew at the first, on the instant, that there was no help for you in him.
1CHÆR.
You act absurdly in tormenting yourself in mind.
By my troth, if I should catch him, I would never allow that slave of a fellow to be laughing at us with impunity.
STRAT.
What can you expect him to do, you, who have such great wealth at home, and have not a coin of it, as you say, and have in yourself no resources for your friend ?
CHiER.
I' faith, if I had had it, I should have proffered it with pleasure;
but something in some manner2, in some way, in some direction, from some person, some hope I have for you, that there'll be some good fortune for you to share with me.
STRAT.
Woe to you, you sneaking fellows.
CHiER.
Why does it please you to abuse me ?
STRAT.
Why, because you are prating to me about some thing in some manner, from somewhere or other, from some persons, that nowhere exists, and I won't admit it to my ears.
Of no more assistance are you unto me than he who never yet has been born.
(They stand near the door of the house of CHÆRIBULUS.)EPID. (to PERIPHANES, within the house).
You've done your duty then;
it now befits me to do mine.
Through this care of mine, you may be allowed to be at ease.
(In a lower voice.)
This, in fact, is now lost to you;
don't at all be setting your hopes on it.
(Holding some of the coins in hit, hands.)
How very shining it is!
You only trust me for that.
This way I'm going to act, this way my forefathers have acted before me.
0 ye immortal Gods, what a brilliant day you have bestowed upon me in this!
how propitious and how favourable to my requests!
But why do I delay to take my departure hence, that I may bear this supply with lucky auspices to the colony1.
I'm delaying while I'm standing here..
But what means this ?
Before the house I see the two companions, my master and Chæribulus.
(Accosting them.)
What are you doing?
Take this, will you.
( Give- STRATIPPOCLES the bag of money.)
STRAT.
How much is there in this ?
EPID.
As much as is enough, and more than enough;
a superabundance;
I've brought more by ten minæ than you owe to the Banker.
So long as I please and obey you, I value my own back at a straw.
STRAT.
But why so ?
EPID.
Because I shall make your father a bag-murderer2.
STRAT.
What kind of expression is that PEPlD.
I don't at all care for your old-fashioned and every­ day words;
you chouse by purses full3, but I'll chouse by bags full.
For the procurer took away a whole lot of money for the music-girl (I paid it;
with these hands I counted it out), her whom your father supposes to be his own daughter.
Now, again, that your father may be deceived, and assistance be provided for you, I've discovered a method.
In such a way have I persuaded the old gentleman-and had a talk to this effect, that, when you returned, you might not have pos­ session of her4EPID.
She's now at your houses in place of her.
STRAT.
I understand.
EPID.
Now he has given me Apæ­ cides by way of guarantee in this matter (he's waiting for me at the Forum), as if to seem the purchaser.
STRAT.
Not a bad precaution!
EPID.
The cautious man's now taken in himself;
your owu father himself placed this purse around my neck1.
He's making preparation, that immediately on your arrival home you shall be married.
STRAT.
In one way only will he persuade me;
if Orcus takes her away from me, who has been brought with me.
EPID.
Now I've hit upon this scheme:
I'll go by myself alone to the procurer's house;
I'll instruct him, if any one comes to him, to say that the money has been paid him for the music-girl;
inasmuch as, the day before yesterday, I paid it down with my own hands for this mistress of yours, whom your father takes to be his own daughter.
Then the procurer, unknowingly, will be staking his accursed head, as though he had received the money for her who has now been brought here together with you.
CHÆR.
You are more versatile than a potter's-wheel.
EPID.
Now I'll get ready some artful music-girl, who's hired at a didrachm, to pretend that she has been purchased, and cleverly to trick the two old fellows:
Apæcides, together with her, will bring her to your father.
EPID.
Her, prepared beforehand with my devices, and provided with my schemes, I shall send to him.
But I'm talking at too great length ;
you have delayed me too long:
you now know these things how they are to be;
I'll be off.
STRAT.
Success attend you!
(Exit EPIDICUS.)CHÆR.
He is very clever at artful tricks.
STRAT.
Indeed, by his plans, he has saved me, that's sure.
CHÆR.
Let's go hence into my house.
STRAT.
Yes, and a little more joyfully than I came out of your house, by the courage and conduct of Epidicus, do I return into camp with the spoil.
(They go into the house.)PERI. (to herself).
Not only for the sake of the face were it right for men to have a mirror for themselves wherein to look at their faces ;
but one with which they might be enabled to examine the heart of discretion, and therefore be able to examine the resources of the mind;
when they had looked in that, they might afterwards consider how they had once passed their lives in youth.
Just as myself, for instance, who, for the sake of my son, began to torment myself in mind, as though my son had been guilty of some offence against me, or as though my own misdeeds had not been most heavy in my youth.
In truth, we old fellows are out of our senses sometimes.
This, in my own opinion at least, has proved ad­ vantageous.
But my friend Apæcides is coming with the spoil.
I'm glad that the negotiator has returned safe.
PERI.
How goes it ?
Ap. The Gods and Goddesses are favouring you.
PERI.
The omen pleases me.
AP.
A person with whom all things go on prosperously.
But do you order her to be taken in-doors.
PERI. (going to the door of his house, and calling).
Hallo there !
come out of doors here, some one.
(A SERVANT comes out.)
Take that woman into the house!
And, do you hear ?
PERI.
Take care you don't permit this woman to as­ sociate with my daughter, or to see her.
Now do you un­ derstand ?
I wish her to be shut up apart in that little chamber;
there's a great difference between the manners of a maiden and a courtesan.
( The SERVANT leads the MUSIC- GIRL into the house.)
AP.
You speak cleverly and judiciously;
each man cannot keep too strict a guard upon the chastity of his daughter.
Upon my faith, we certainly did forestall this woman from your son just in time.
PERI.
Why so?
Ap.
Because another person told me that he had just seen your son here.
PERI.
I' troth, he was stirring in this business.
Ap.
Upon my faith, it really is so, clearly.
You really have a clever servant, and worth any price.
PERI.
At his weight in gold he would not be dear.
A-?.
How well he kept1 that Music-girl quite in ignorance that she was purchased for you;
so full of joke and fun did he bring her hither along with him.
PERI.
It's wonderful how that could be managed.
Ap.
He said that you were going to offer a sacrifice at home for your son, because he had returned safe from Thebes.
PERI.
He hit upon the right thing.
Ap.
Yes, and he himself told her that she bad been hired to assist you here in the sacrifice.
He said that you were about to perform it, and that you had a sacrifice at home.
But I then made pretence that I was ignorant, as it were, inas.
much as I made myself out half-witted2.
PERI.
Why yes;
it was right to do so.
AP.
An important trial of a friend is going on at the Forum ;
I want to go as his advocate.
PERI.
Go, and when you have leisure, return to me mediately.
AP.
I'll be here just now.
(Exit.PERI. (to himself).
Nothing is there more opportune to man than a friend in need;
without labour of your own, whac you want is done nevertheless.
If I had commissioned any pne upon this business, a less skilful person, and less fitted for this matter, he would have been gulled;
and so, grinning with his white teeth, my son would have most deservedly laughed at me.
But who is this I see coming this way, that with his swaggering makes his scarf to be streaming in the wind ?
(He stands aside.)CAPT. (to his SERVANT).
Take care not to pass by any house without asking where lives the old gentleman, Peri- phanes of Plothea1.
Take care that you don't return to me without knowing it.
PERI.(comingforward).
Young man, if I point out to you the person whom you are in search of, what thanks shall I get of you PCArT.
In arms, by the might of war, I've deserved that all people ought to give me thanks.
PERI.
You haven't found out, young man, a tranquil spot where to recount your virtues as you wish ;
for, if an inferior vaunts his battles to a superior, by his lips they become soiled;
but this Periphanes of Plothea whom you are seeking, I am he, if you want him for anything.
CAPT.
Him, you mean, who in his youth among kings in arms, by his skill in war, gained vast wealth ?
PERI.
Aye, if you were to hear of my achievements, drop ping your hands you would run off home.
CAPT.
I' faith, l'in rather in search of one to whom to speak of my own, than ot one to be speaking of his to me.
PERI.
This is not the place for it.
Do you then look out for another person, into whom to stuff your scraps of nonsense2.
(Aside.)
And yet this is folly, for me to impute that to him as a fault, which I myself used to do in my youth when I was a soldier;
in recounting my battles I used to tear out men'a ears by the roots, when I had once begun.
CAPT.
Lend your attention, that you may learn what I've come to you about.
I've heard that you have purchased my mistress.
PERI. (aside).
Heyday!
now at last I know who he is;
the officer whom Epidicus was telling me about a short time since.
(To the OFFICER.)
Young man, it is as you say;
I have purchased her.
CAPT.
I want a few words with you, if it is not incon­ venient to you.
PERI.
Upon my faith, I don't know whether it's convenient or not, until perhaps you say what you want.
CART.
I want you to transfer her to me, and take the ransom.
PERI.
You may have her.
CART.
But why should I hesitate to speak out to you ?
I wish at once to make her my freed-woman, that she may be my mistress1.
PERI.
I'll make short work with you;
she was bought for me for fifty minæ of silver;
if sixty minæ are paid down to me, I'll let the damsel employ your holidays2, and so assuredly so, that, if you like,you may remove her from this country.
CAPT.
Is she then purchased by me ?
PERI.
On those terms you may have her.
You have made a good bargain.
(Going to the door of his house.)
Hallo there !
bring out of doors the Music-girl you took in.
The harp, too, as well, that was thrown in with her, I'll make you a present of it for nothing.
PERI. (takinq her by the hand and leading her to the CAP­ TAIN).
Come, take her, please.
CAPT.
What madness possesses you ?
What mystery are you devising for me ?
Why don't you order the Music-girl 3 to be brought from in-doors ?
PERI.
Why, this is the Music-girl.
There's no other one here.
CAPT.
You can't impose on me.
Why don't you bring out here the Music-girl Acropolistis PPERI.
This, I tell you, is she.,CAPT.
This, I tell you, is not she.
Do you suppose that I can't know my own mistress ?
PERI.
It was this Music-girl,I tell you, for whom my son was dying with love.
CAPT.
This is not she.
PERI.
How, not she ?CAPT.
It is not.
PERI.
Where in the world, then, does she come from ?
For my part, i' faith, I certainly paid the money for her.
CAPT.
Foolishly paid, I guess, and a mighty mistake.
PERI.
Nay, but this is she;
for I sent the servant who is in the habit of attending my son;
he himself this moment pur­ chased the Music-girl.
CAPT.
Well then, this fellow has cut you up joint by joint, old gentleman, this servant of yours.
PERI.
How, cut me up ?
CAPT.
Such is my suspicion;
for she has been palmed upon you for that Music-girl.
Old gentleman, you've been bubbled clearly and cleverly.
I shall now go seek her wherever she is.
Warrior, farewell!
(Exeunt the OFFICER and SERVANT.
PERI. (stamping with rage).
Bravo, bravo!
Epidicus
You're a clever fellow!
You have fought well—you’re a man!
you've wiped my nose when snivelling, worthless fellow that I am!
(To the MUSIC-GIRL.)
Did Apæcides purchase you to-day of the procurer ?(A pause.)
Come now, tell me.
Mus.-G. I never heard of that person before to-day, nor, indeed, was any one able to purchase me for any money;
I've been free now for more than five years.
PERI.
What business have you, then, at my house PMus.-G.
You shall hear;
I came, being hired to perform for an old gentleman while he was sacrificing.
PERI.
I do confess that I am the most worthless of all men in Athens of Attica.
But do you know Acropolistis the Music-girl ?
Mus.-G.
As well as my own self.
PERI.
Where does she live ?
Mus.-G. Since she has been made free, I don't know for certain.
PERI.
Well now, I should like to know who has made her free, if you know PMus.
-Gr. That which I have heard, you shall hear;
I heard that Stratippocles1, the son of Periphanes, had provided in his absence that she should be made free.
PERI.
By heavens, I'm undone1, most clearly, if these things are true.
Epidicus has disembowelled my purse!
Mus.-G. I've heard to that effect.
Do you want me for anything else ?
PERI.
Away to perdition in the veriest torments, and off this instant !
Mus.-G.
Won't you give me back my harp ?
PERI.
Neither harp nor pipes.
Make haste, then, and escape from here, if the Gods love you!
Mus.-G. I'll be off.
At a future time, however, you'll re­ store it, with the greater disgrace2 to yourself.
(Exit.PERI. (to himself).
What now?
Shall I, who have been placed before so many edicts3, allow him to get off with im­ punity ?
No;
even though as much again should be re­ quired to be lost, I'll lose it rather than allow myself to be held in derision with impunity and plundered by them.
That I should have been thus cheated openly to my face, and that I should have been set at nought before this Apæcides, who is famed as being the framer and founder of all the laws and ordinances!
He too declares that he is a wise man!
that the hammer, forsooth, should be wiser than the handle4!
(He stands aside.)PHIL. (to herself).
If a mortal being has aught of misery, through which, miserable creature, to be wretched from the heart, that same do I experience, for whom full many a woe unites in the same spot, which, all, at the same instant are beating against my breast.
A multitude of troubles keep me in suspense.
Poverty and misery alarm the thoughts of my heart;
nor have I anywhere a spot of safety where to fix my hopes;
in such a way has my daughter fallen into the power of the enemyl;
nor do I know where she now is.
PERI. (apart).
Who is this woman coming from a distance with a breast filled with alarms, and who thus bewails her lot ?
PHIL. (to herself).
It was told me that Periphanes was living in this neighbourhood.
PERI. (apart).
She's mentioning me;
need of hospitality has befallen her, I suppose.
PHIL. (to herself).
I would be very willing to give a re­ ward to any one who would point me out that man, or where he dwells.
PERI. (apart).
I recognize her;
for I think I have seen her before;
where, I know not.
Is it, or is it not she, whom my mind suspects her to be ?
PHIL.
(seeing him).
Good Gods!
I have seen this person before !
PERI. (to himself).
It surely is she, a poor woman whom I remember having an intrigue with at Epidaurus.
PHIL. (to herself).
Surely it is he, who at Epidaurus first violated my maiden modesty.
PERI. (to himself).
She who had the daughter by me whom I've now got at home.
PHIL. (to herself).
What if I accost him PPERI. (to himself).
I don't know whether to make up to her.
If this is shePHIL. (to herself).
But if it is the man, as length of years renders me doubtful——PERI. (to himself).
Length of time renders my mind un­ certain.
But if it is she, whom with some doubt I conjecture it to be, I'll accost her circumspectly.
PHIL. (to herself).
A woman's artfulness must be em­ ployed by me.
PERI. (to himself).
I'll address her.
PHIL. (to herself).
I'll bring my powers of conversation to bear against him.
PERI. (accosting her).
Health to you!
PHIL.
That health I accept for me and mine.
PERI.
What besides ?
PHIL.
Health to yourself;
what you lent me, I return.
PERI.
I don't impeach your punctuality.
Don't I know you?
PHIL.
If I know you, I'll move your feelings, so that you shall know me.
PERI.
Where have I been in the habit of seeing you ?
PHIL.
You are unfairly hard upon me.
PERI.
Why so ?
PHIL.
Because you think it right that I should be the prompter of your memory.
PERI.
You speak to the purpose.
PHIL.
You say what's strange tome, Periphanes.
PERI.
Ah now!
that's better.
Do you remember, Phi­ lippaPHIL.
Tes, I remember that.
PERI.
At Epidaurus——PHIL.
Ah!
you have moistened my burning breast with a little drop of comfort.
PERI.
How I relieved the poverty of you, a poor young maiden, and your mother?
PHIL.
What, are you he who for your own gratification brought heavy troubles upon me ?
PERI.
I am he.
Health to you.
PHIL.
I am in health, since I see you in health.
PERI.
Give me your hand.
PHIL.

Take it—you hold by the hand a woman distrest and full of woes.
PERI.
What is it that disturbs your features ?
PHIL.
The daughter whom I had by youPERI.
What of her ?
PHIL.
When I had brought her up, I lost her;
she fell into the hands of the enemy.
PERI.
Keep your mind in quiet and at rest.
Why look, she's here at my house safe and sound.
For immediately I heard from my servant that she was a captive, instantly I gave the money for her to be purchased;
he managed this affair as is discreetly and frugally as in other matters hePHIL.
Let me see her, whether it is she or no.
PERI. (going to the door of his house).
Hallo there!
you —Canthara, this instant bid my daughter1 come out before the house, that she may see her mother.
PHIL.
My spirits now at last return to me.
ACRO.
Why is it, father, that you have called me out before the house ?
PERI.
That you may see and accost your mother, and wish her health on her arrival, and give her kisses.
ACRO. (looking about).
What mother of mine?
PERI. ( pointing to PHILIPPA).
She who, half dead, is follow­ ing your gaze.
PHIL.
Who is this that you are requesting to kiss me ?
PERI.
Your own daughter.
PHIL.
What, she ?
PERI.
She.
PHIL.
What—am I to kiss her ?
PERI.
Why not, her who was born of you ?
PHIL.
Man, you are mad.
PERI.
What, I ?PHIL.
Yes, you.
PERI.
Why ?
PHIL.
Because this woman—I neither know nor understand who she is, nor have I beheld her with my eyes before this day.
PERI.
I know why you are mistaken;
because this woman has her dress and ornaments changed.
PHIL.
Puppies have one smell2, pigs quite another;
I say that I do not know her, who she is.
PERI. (stamping with rage).
Oh!
by our trust in Gods and men, what is this ?
Am I following the calling of a Procurer, to be keeping strange women in my house, and to be empty­ ing my house of my money ?
(To ACROPOLISTIS.)
What are you to be calling me your father and kissing me ?
Why stand you stupidly there ?
Why do you keep silent ?
ACRO.
What do you want me to say ?
PERI. (pointing to PHILIPPA).
She denies that she is your mother.
ACRO.
Don't let her be so, if she don't choose.
For my own part, whether she likes it or not, I shall be my mother's daughter still.
It isn't right for me to compel this woman to be my, mother if she doesn't like.
PERI.
Why then did you call me lather ?
ACRO.
That is your own fault, not mine;
ought I not to call you father when you call me daughter ?
Her too, as well (pointing to PHILIPPA), if she were to call me daughter, I should call mother.
She declares that I am not her daughter;
then she is not my mother.
In fine, this is no fault of mine;
what I've been taught, I've told you all of it.
Epidicus was my instructor.
PERI.I'm undone!
I've upset my waggon1 !
ACRO.
Have I done anything amiss towards that ?
PERI.
Upon my faith, if I ever hear you call me father, I'll put an end to your life, you jade!
ACRO.
I shan't call you so.
When you want to be my father, then be so;
when you don't want, don't be my father.
PHIL. (to PERIPHANES).
What?
Did you purchase her for that reason, because you supposed her to be your daugh­ ter ?
By what signs did you recognize her ?
PERI.
By none.
PHIL.
Why did you suppose her to be our daughter ?
PERI.
My servant Epidicus told me so.
PHIL.
What if it had seemed to your servant otherwise P Prithee, could you not have known ?
PERI.
How should I, who had never seen her after having once beheld her.
PHIL.
Wretched creature, I'm quite undone!
(Begins to weep.)PERI.
Don't weep, madam;
go in-doors;
be of good cou­ rage ;
I'll find her out.
PHIL.
An Attic citizen from Athens here purchased her Indeed, they said it was a young man who had bought her.
PERI.
I will find her ;
hold your peace.
Only do go in-doors, and keep an eye upon this Circe1, this daughter of the Sun.
(She goes into the house, followed by ACROFOLISTIS.)
All business laid aside, I'll give my attention to seeking for Epidicus.
If I find him, I'll make this day become the final one for him.
(Exit.STRAT. (to himself).
The Banker2 is inattentive to me, not to seek the money of me, or bring this woman who has been purchased out of the spoil.
But see-here comes Epidicus How's this, that in gloominess his brow is wrinkled ?1EPID. (to himself).
If Jupiter unto himself were to take the eleven Gods3 beside himself, even then, all of them would not be able to rescue Epidicus from torture.
I've seen Peri­ phanes buying the thongs;
Apæcides was together with him;
now, I do believe that these persons are in search of me.
They have found it out;
they know that they've been im­ posed upon.
STRAT. (coming forward).
What are you about, my ready occasion ?
EPID.
That which a wretched fellow is about.
STRAT.
What's the matter with you ?
EPID.
Why don't you prepare for me the necessaries for flight before I'm quite undone?
For the two fleeced old gentlemen are hunting for me through the city;
they are carrying in their hands handcuffs an inch and a half thick.
EPID.
Of course I will, whose freedom is so close at hand1.
STRAT.
I will preserve you.
EPID.
I' faith, they'll do it better for me, if they catch me.
But who's this young woman, this greyish old fellow, too, that's coming along ?
STRAT.
This is the Banker, and this is the woman whom I purchased out of the spoil.
EPID.
What, is this she ?
STRAT.
It is she.
Isn't she just like what I told you ?
Look at her.
EPID.
Is it she ?
STRAT.
Survey her, Epidicus.
Even from her nail to the top of her hair she is most lovely!
Is she not ?
Do look at her!
Observe her!
You'll be looking at a picture beauti­ fully painted.
EPID.
Judging from your words you are foretelling that my hide will be beautifully painted;
me, whom Apelles and Zeuxis2, the pair of them, will be painting with elm-tree pigments.
STRAT. (to the BANKER).
Immortal Gods!
I'm surprised at your slowness.
The man that's spoken of in the proverb with swollen feet, would have got here sooner than you have arrived for me.
BAN. (pointing to TELESTIS).
I' faith, 'twas she delayed me.
STRAT.
If indeed you delayed for her sake, because she wished it, you have come too quickly.
BAN.
Well, well, dispatch with me and count out the money, that I mayn't be detaining my friends.
STRAT.
It has been counted out.
BAN. (giving him a bag).
Take this bag;
put it into it.
STRAT.
You come discreetly provided!
Wait till I bring out the money to you.
BAN.
Make haste.
STRAT.
It's at home, (Goes into the house of CHÆRIBULUS.)EPID. (looking steadily at TELESTIS).
Have I the use of my eyes quite unimpaired, or is it otherwise ?
Do I not behold in you, Telestis, the daughter of Periphanes, born at Thebes of your mother Pbilippa, and conceived at Epidaurus ?
TEL.
What person are you who are making mention of the name of my parents and my own ?
EPID.
Don't you know me ?
TEL.
Not, indeed, so far as recurs to my mind just now.
EPID.
Don't you remember my bringing you a crescent upon your birthday, and a little gold ring for your finger ?
(STRATIPPOCLES returns with the money.)TEL.
I remember it.
What, are you that person ?
EPID.
I am, and (pointing to STBATIPPOCLES, at a distance) he there is your brother by another mother and the same father.
TEL. in;
agitation).
What of my father ?
Is he alive ?
EPID.
Be of calm and composed feelings;
hold your peace.
TEL.
The Gods will that from being lost I should be saved, if you speak the truth.
EPID.
I have no occasion to be telling untruths to you.
STRAT. (to the BANKER).
Take this money, Banker;
here are forty minæ.
If any piece shall be doubtful I'll change it.
(Gives him the money.)BAN.
You do well.
Kindly farewell.
(Exit.STRAT. (to TELESTIS).
Now then you are my ownTEL.
Why yes—sister, i' faith, that you may know it as well.
Greetings to you, brother.
STRAT. (to EPIDICUS).
Is this woman in her senses ?
EPID.
In her senses, if she calls you her brother.
STRAT.
How's this ?
Have I just now become her bro­ ther while going in-doors and coming out ?
EPID.
What good fortune there is, do you in silence keep your peace thereon and rejoice.
STRAT.
Sister, you have both lost and found me !
EPID.
Simpleton, hold your tongue!
Through my en­ deavours, there's ready for you at home, in fact, a Music-girl for you to make love to;
I too, through my endeavours, have restored your sister to liberty.
EPID.
B3 off into the house, and order the water to be made warm1 for her.
The rest I'll let you know afterwards, when there's leisure.
STRAT.
Follow me this way, sister.
EPm. I'll bid Thesprio2 come across to you.
But re­ member, if the old gentlemen are at all savage, you, with your sister, to run and help me.
STRAT.
That will be easy.
(He and TELESTIS go into the house of PERIPHANES.)EPID.
(going to the door of the house of CHÆRIBULUS).
Thesprio, come this way through the garden.
Come to my rescue at home!
The matter's of importance!
( To himself.)
I care much less for the old fellows than I did just now.
I'll return in-doors, that the strangers may be attended to on their arrival.
I'll tell these same things that I know, in-doors to Stratippocles.
I shall not take to flight;
I'm determined to be there at home, and he shan't throw it in my teeth that he has been provoked by my running away3.
I'll away in-doors ;
I've been talking too long.
(Goes into the house of PERI­ PHANES.)PERI.
Hasn't this fellow quite made a laughing-stock of us two decrepit old people4 ?
AP.
Why yes, I' faith, you've really kept me plagued in a shocking fashion.
PERI.
Now do hold your tongue.
Only let me catch the fellow!
AP.
I'll tell you now, that you may know it.
It's best for you to seek another companion;
so much, while I've been following you, has the congested blood, from weariness, come down into the knees of poor me.
PERI.
After how many fashions has this fellow made sport of me and you to-day!
besides, how he has disembowelled my silver resources for me!
A p. Away with him from me;
for surely he's the son of Vulcan in his wrath:
wherever he touches, he sets all on fire;
if you stand by him, he scorches you with his heat.
EPID. (to himself).
More than the twelve Gods, the im­ mortal Gods as many as are in the heavens, are now assistants in my rescue, and are fighting on my side.
As to whatever I have offended in, I have aid and assistance at boree.
All my enemies I quite spurn by the heels2.
PERI. (looking about).
Where in the world shall I look for him PAP.
So long as you look for him without me, you may look for him even in the middle of the sea, as far as I'm concerned.
EPID.
(coming forward, and addressing PERIPHANES).
Why are you looking for me ?
Why are you taking this trouble ?
Why are you worrying him ?
(Pointing to APECIDES.)
See, here I am.
Have I run away from you ?
Have I betaken myself from the house ?
Have I hid myself from your sight ?
I don't entreat you either.
Do you wish to bind me ?
Look then, I present my hands.
(Holding out his hands.)
You have got thongs;
I saw you purchase them.
Why do you delay now ?
Do bind me !
PERI.
It's all over3.
He gives bail to me of his own ac­ cord for his appearance.
EPID.
Why don't you bind me ?
AP.
A wicked slave, upon my faith!
EPID.
Really, Apæcides, I don't want you to intercede for me.
AP.
You easily obtain your wish, Epidicus.
EPID. (to PERIPHANES).
Are you going to do anything?
PERI.
What, at your pleasure ?
EPID.
Troth, at my own, indeed, and not at yours, are these hands to be bound by you to-day.
PERI.
But I don't choose;
I shan't bind them.
AP. (to PERIPHANES).
He's preparing to throw a drag­ net over you;
he's framing some plan, I know not what.
EPID.
You are causing delay to yourself, while I stand un­ bound ;
bind them, I tell you, bind them together.
PERI.
But I choose rather to question you unbound.
EPID.
But you shall know nothing.
AP.
What are you to do ?
Let him be complied with.
EPID.
You are a worthy person, Apæcides.
PERI.
Hold out your hands then.
EPID. (holding out his hands).
They don't at all object;
bind them fast together too.
Don't be afraid.
(PERIPHANES binds his hands.)
I'm submissive.
When the job is done, then pronounce your judgmentl.
PERI.
There, that is good.
EPID.
Now then, to the point, with your enquiries of me;
ask me what you please.
PERI.
In the first place, with what assurance did you pre­ sume to say that she who was bought the day before yester­ day was my daughter ?
EPID.
I chose to;
on that assurance.
PERI.
Do you say so?
You chose to?
EPID.
I do say so.
Even lay me a wager that she is not the daughter——PERI.
A woman whom the mother declares she doesn't know ?
EPID.
Then, if she isn't the daughter of her mother, make me a bet about it, my didrachm to your talent2.
PERI.
Why, that's a mere catch.
But who is this woman ?
EPID.
The mistress of your son.
that you may know the whole matter.
PERI.
Did I not give you the thirty minæ for my daughter ?
EPID.
I confess that they were given, and that with that money I purchased this Music-girl, your son's mistress, instead of your daughter.
As to those thirty minæ, in fact, I imposed upon you.
PERI.
For what reason did you play a trick upon me about that hired Music-girl PEPID.
I' faith, I really did do it, and I think it was rightly done.
PERI.
In the last place, what has been done with the silver I gave you?
EPID.
I'll tell you;
I gave it to a person neither bad nor yet good1—your son Stratippocles.
PERI.
Why did you dare to give it him ?
EPID.
Because it pleased me.
PERI. (stamping).
Plague on it!
what insolence is this ?
EPID.
Am I to be bawled at just as if I were a slave ?
PERI. (ironically).
As you are a free man, I rejoice.
EPID.
I have deserved to become so.
PERI.
You—deserved ?
EPID.
Go look in-doors;
I'll let you know that this is the truth.
PERI.
What's the matter?
EPID.
The thing itself will tell you so at once.
Only do go in-doors.
PERI.
Aye, aye!
this is not without its meaning.
Do you keep an eye on him, Apæcides.
(Goes into his house.)Ap. What's the meaning of this, Epidicus ?
EPID.
I' faith, it's with the greatest injustice that I'm standing here bound, through whose aid his daughter has been discovered to-day.
Ap.
Do you say that you have found his daughter?
EPID.
I have found her, and she is at home.
But how hard it is, when, for services done, you reap a harvest of evil.
A p. What, her whom this day we've both been weary with seeking throughout the city ?
EPID.
I'm weary with finding, you weary with seeking.
PERI. (at the door, to those within).
Why do you entreat me thus earnestly in his behalf ?
For I find that he does deserve that I should be pleased to act according to his deserts.
(To EPIDICUS.)
Hold out your hands, you, that I may unbind them.
EPID.
Don't you touch them.
PERI.
But do you present them to me.
EPID.
I don't choose.
PERI.
You don't do right.
EPID.
Upon my faith, I'll never allow myself to be un­ bound this day, unless you give me satisfaction.
PERI.
You ask what's very fair and very just.
Shoes, a tunic, and a cloak I'll give you.
EPID.
What next, after that?
PERI.
Your freedom.
EPID.
But after that?
There's need for a new-made freed-man to pick a bit1.
PERI.
It shall be given;
I'll find you food.
EPID.
On my word, never this day shall you release me, unless you beg my pardon.
PERI.
I do entreat you, Epidicus, to forgive me, if un­ awares in fault I've done anything wrong.
But by way of return for this matter, be a free man.
EPm.
Against my inclination do I grant you this pardon, but I'm compelled by necessity.
Unbind them then, if you choose.
(He holds out his hands, which are unbound by PERIPHANES, and they go into his house.)
This is that man who by his roguery2 has gained his free­ dom.
Clap your hands, and fare you well!
Stretch your loins, and rise from your seats.
THEUROPIDES, a merchant of Athens.
SIMO, an aged Athenian, his neighbour.
PHlLOLACHES, son of Theuropides.
CALLIDAMATES, a young Athenian, friend of PhilolachesTRANIO, servant of Philolaches.
GRUMIO, servant of Thenropides.
ANOTHER SERVANT of Callidamates.
A BANKER.A BOY.
PHILEMATIUM, a music-girl, mistress of Philolaclice.
SCAPHA, her attendant.
DELPHIUM, mistress of Callidamates.
Scene—Athens;
before the houses of THEUROPIDES and .WHILE Theuropides is absent from home on business, his son Philolaches leads a dissolute life at home with his friend Callidamates and his own servant Tranio
While they are in the midst of their carousals, the father of Philolaches unex­ pectedly arrives at Athens.
Their first impulse is to leave the house imme­ diately, but, Callidamates being in a state of helpless intoxication, they are prevented from so doing.
In this dilemma, Tranio undertakes to rescue them.
He requests them to remain perfectly quiet in the house, and not to stir out of it.
The house is then shut up, and he sallies forth to meet Theuropides.
He pre­ tends to him that the house has been shut up for some months past, in conse­ quence of its being haunted.
In the midst of the conversation, he is accosted by a Banker, who duns him for the interest of some money which Philolaches has borrowed of him for the purpose of procuring the freedom of Philematium, his mistress.
Thenropides enquires what the money was borrowed for, on which Tranio says that Philolaches has purchased a house with it.
On Theuropides making further enquiries, Tranio says that he has bought the house in which Simo is living.
On this, Theuropides wishes to examine this new purchase, and sends Tranio to request Simo to allow him to do so, if not inconvenient.
Tranio obtains the permission, Simo being ignorant of the object, and they go over the house, Theuropides being much pleased with his son's bargain.
Tranio is then sent by Theuropides into the country to fetch Philolaches thence, he having pretended that he is there.
Shortly after, a servant of Callidamates comes to the house that is shut up to fetch his master home.
Theuropides questions him, and then finds out the deception that has been practised upon him;
and on receiving further information from Simo, who declares that he has not sold his own house, he resolves to punish Tranio.
The latter, on finding this to be the case, runs to an altar for refuge.
Callidamates, who is now sober, and has got out of the house by the back-gate, now makes his appearance, and, at his earnest intercession, pardon is granted by Theuropides to Philo­ laches and Tramo.
PmLOLACHES has given liberty to (Manumisit) his mistress who has been bought by him, and he consumes all (Omnem) his substance in the absence of his father.
When he returns, Tranio deceives the old man (Senem);
he says that frightful (Terrifica) apparitions have been seen in the house, and (Et) that at once they had removed from it.
A Usurer, greedy of gain (Lucripeta), comes up in the meantime, asking for the interest of some money, and again the olo man is made sport of (Lusus);
for the servant says that a deposit for a house which has been bought has been taken up (Acceptum) on loan.
The old man enquires (Requirit) which it is;
he says that of the neighbour next door.
He then looks over (Inspectat) it.
Afterwards he is vexed that he has been laughed at;
still by (Ab) the companion of his son he is finally appeased.
GRU.
Get out of the kitchen, will you;
out of it, you whip-scoundrel, who are giving me your cavilling talk amid the platters;
march out of the house, you ruin of your master.
Upon my faith, if I only live, I'll be soundly revenged upon you in the country.
Get out, I say, you steam of the kitchen.
Why are you skulking thus ?
TRA.
Why the plague are you making this noise here before the house?
Do you fancy yourself to be in the country2 ?
Get out of the house;
be off into the country.
Go and hang yourself.
Get away from the door.
(Striking him.)
There now, was it that you wanted ?
Gnu. (running away).
I'm undone !
Why are you beat­ ing me ?
TRA.
Because you want it.
GRIT.
I must endure it.
Only let the old gentleman re­ turn home;
only let him come safe home, whom you are de­ vouring in his absence.
TRA.
You don't say what's either likely or true, you , blockhead, as to any one devouring a person in his absence.
GRIT.
Indeed, you town wit, you minion of the mob, do you throw the country in my teeth ?
Really, Tranio, I do believe that you feel sure that before long you'll be handed over to the mill.
Within a short period, i' faith, Tranio, you'll full soon be adding to the iron-bound race1 in the country.
While you choose to, and have the opportunity, drink on, squander his property, corrupt my master's son, a most worthy young man, drink night and day, live like Greeks2, make purchase of mistresses, give them their freedom, feed parasites, feast yourselves sumptuously.
Was it thus that the old gentle­ man enjoined you when he went hence abroad ?
Is it after this fashion that he will find his property well husbanded ?
Do you suppose that this is the duty of a good servant, to be ruining both the estate and the son of his master ?
For I do consider him as ruined, when he devotes himself to these goings on.
A person, with whom not one of all the young men of Attica was before deemed equally frugal or more steady, the same is now carrying off the palm in the opposite direction.
Through your management and your tutoring has that been done.
TRA.
What the plague business have you with me or with what I do ?
Prithee, haven't you got your cattle in the country for you to look to ?
I choose to drink, to intrigue, to keep my wenches;
this I do at the peril of my own back, and not of yours.
GRIT.
Then with what assurance he does talk!
(Turning away in disgust.)
Faugh!TRA.
But may Jupiter and all the Deities confound you;
you stink of garlick, you filth unmistakeable, you clod, you he-goat, you pig-sty, you mixture of dog and she-goat.
GRU.
What would you have to be done ?
It isn't all that can smell of foreign perfumes, if you smell of them;
or that can take their places at table above their master, or live on such exquisite dainties as you live upon.
Do you keep to yourself those turtle-doves, that fish, and poultry;
let me enjoy my lot upon garlick diet.
You are fortunate;
I unlucky.
It must be endured.
Let my good fortune be awaiting me, your bad yourself.
TRA.
You seem, Grumio, as though you envied me, be­ cause I enjoy myself and you are wretched.
It is quite my due.
It's proper for me to make love, and for you to feed the cattle;
for me to fare handsomely, you in a miserable way.
GRU.
0 riddle for the executioner1, as I guess it will turn out;
they'll be so pinking you with goads, as you carry your gibbet2 along the streets one day, as soon as ever the old gentleman returns here.
TRA.
How do you know v hether that mayn't happen to yourself sooner than to me ?
GRIT.
Because I have never deserved it;
you have deserve . it, and you now deserve it.
TRA.
Do cut short the trouble of your talking, unless you wish a heavy mischance to befall you.
GRU.
Are you going to give me the tares for me to take for the cattle?
If you are not, give me the money.
Go on, still persist in the way in which you've commenced!
Drink, live like Greeks, eat, stuff yourselves, slaughter your fatlings !
TRA.
Hold your tongue, and be off into the country;
I in­ tend to go to the Piræus to get me some fish for the evening.
To-morrow I'll make some one bring you the tares to the farm.
What's the matter ?
Why now are you starmg at me, gallows-bird ?
Gnu.
I' faith, I've an idea that will be your own title before long.
TRA.
So long as it is as it is, in the meantime I'll put up with that " before long."
GRU.
That's the way;
and understand this one thing, that that which is disagreable comes much more speedily than that which you wish for.
TRA.
Don't you be annoying;
now then, away with you into the country, and betake yourself off.
Don't you deceive yourself, henceforth you shan't be causing me any impedi­ ment.
(Exit.GRU. (to himself).
Is he really gone?
Not to care one straw for what I've said!
0 immortal Gods, I do implore your aid, do cause this old gentleman of ours, who has now been three years absent from here, to return hither as soon as pos­ sible, before everything is gone, both house and land.
Unless he does return here, remnants to last for a few months only are left.
Now I'll be off to the country;
but look!
I see my master's son, one who has been corrupted from having been a most excellent young man.
(Exit.PHIL. (to himself).
I've often thought and long reflected on it, and in my breast have held many a debate, and in my heart (if any heart I have) have revolved this matter, and long discussed it, to what thing I'm to consider man as like, and what form he has when he is born?
I've now discovered this likeness.
I think a man is like unto a new house when he is born.
I'll give my proofs of this fact.
( To the AUDIENCE.)
And does not this seem to you like the truth ?
But so I'll manage that you shall think it is so.
Beyond a doubt I'll convince you that it is true what I say.
And this your­ selves, I'm sure, when you have heard my words, will say is no otherwise than just as I now affirm that it is.
Listen while I repeat my proofs of this fact;
I want you to be equally knowing with myself upon this matter.
As soon as ever a house is built up, nicely polished off, carefully erected, and according to rule, people praise the architect and ap­ prove of the house, they take from it each one a model for himself.
Each one has something similar, quite at his own expense;
they do not spare their pains.
But when a worth­ less, lazy, dirty, negligent fellow betakes himself thither with an idle family, then is it imputed as a fault to the house, while a good house is being kept in bad repair.
And this is often the case;
a storm comes on and breaks the tiles and gutters;
then a careless owner takes no heed to put up others.
A shower comes on and streams down the walls;
the rafters admit the rain;
the weather rots the labours of the builder;
then the utility of the house becomes diminished;
and yet this is not the fault of the builder.
But a great part of mankind have contracted this habit of delay;
if any­ thing can be repaired by means of money, they are always still putting it off, and don't * * * do it until the walls come tumbling down1;
then the whole house has to be built anew.
These instances from buildings I've mentioned;
and now I wish to inform you how you are to suppose that men are like houses.
In the first place then, the parents are the builders-up of the children, and lay the foundation for the children ;
they raise them up, they carefully train them to strength, and that they may be good both for service and for view before the public.
They spare not either their own pains or their cost, nor do they deem expense in that to be an expense.
They refine them, teach them literature, the ordinances, the laws ;
at their own cost and labour they struggle, that others may wish for their own children to be like to them.
When they repair to the army, they then find them some relation2 of theirs as a pro­ tector.
At that moment they pass out of the builder's hands.
One year's pay has now been earned;
at that period, then, a sample is on view how the building will turn out.
But 1 was always discreet and virtuous, just as long as I was under the management of the builder.
After I had left him to follow the bent of my own inclinations, at once I entirely spoiled the labours of the builders.
Idleness came on;
that was my storm;
on its arrival, upon me it brought down hail and showers, which overthrew my modesty and the bounds of virtue, and untiled them for me in an instant.
After that I was neglectful to cover in again;
at once passion like a torrent entered my heart;
it flowed down even unto my breast, and soaked through my heart.
Now both property, credit, fair fame, virtue, and honor have forsaken me;
by usage have I become much worse, and, i' faith (so rotten are these rafters of mine with moisture), I do not seem to myself to be able possibly to patch up my house to prevent it from falling down totally once for all, from perishing from the foundation, and from no one being able to assist me.
My heart pains me, when I reflect how I now am and how I once was, than whom in youthful age not one there was more active in the arts of exercise1, with the quoit, the javelin, the ball, racing, arms, and horses.
I then lived a joyous life2;
in frugality and hardihood I was an example to others;
all, even the most deserving, took a lesson from me for them­ selves.
Now that I'm become worthless, to that, indeed, have I hastened through the bent of my inclinations.
(He stands apart.)
PHILE.
On my word, for this long time I've not bathed in cold water with more delight than just now;
nor do I think that I ever was, my dear Scapha, more thoroughly cleansed than now.
SCA.
May the upshot of everything be unto you like a plenteous year's harvest.
PHILE.
What has this harvest got to do with my bathing ?
SCA.
Not a bit more than your bathing has to do with the harvest.
PHILO. (apart).
0 beauteous Venus, this is that storm of mine which stripped off all the modesty with which I was roofed;
through which Desire and Cupid poured their shower into my breast;
and never since have I been able to roof it in.
Now are my walls soaking in my heart;
this building is utterly undone.
PHILE.
Do look, my Scapha, there's a dear, whether this dress quite becomes me.
I wish to please Philolaches my protector, the apple of my eye.
SCA.
Nay but, you set yourself off to advantage with pleasing manners, inasmuch as you yourself are pleasing.
The lover isn't in love with a woman's dress, but with that which stuffs out1 the dress.
PHILO. (apart).
So may the Gods bless me, Scapha is waggish;
the hussy's quite knowing.
How cleverly she under­ stands all matters, the maxims of lovers too !
PHILE.
Well now ?
SCA..
What is it ?
PHILE.
Why look at me and examine, how this becomes me.
SCA.
Thanks to your good looks, it happens that whatever you put on becomes you.
PHILO. (apart).
Now then, for that expression, Scapha, I'll make you some present or other to-day, and I won't allow you to have praised her for nothing who is so pleasing to me.
PHILE.
I don't want you to flatter me.
SCA.
Really you are a very simple woman.
Come now, would you rather be censured undeservedly, than be praised with truth ?
Upon my faith, for my own part, even though undeservedly, I'd much rather be praised than be found fault with with reason, or that other people should laugh at my appearance.
PHILE.
I love the truth;
I wish the truth to be told me ;
I detest a liar.
SCA.
So may you love me, and so may your Philolaches love you, how charming you are.
PHILO. (apart).
How say you, you hussy ?
In what words did you adjure ? "
So may I love her ?"
Why wasn't "
So may she love me" added as well ?
I revoke the present.
What I just now promised you is done for;
you have lost the present.
SCA.
Troth, for my part I am surprised that you, a person so knovring, so clever, and so well educated, are not aware that you are acting foolishly.
PHILE.
Then give me your advice, I beg, if I have done wrong in anything.
SCA.
I' faith, you certainly do wrong, in setting your mind upon him alone, in fact, and humouring him in particular in this way and slighting other men.
It's the part of a married woman, and not of courtesans, to be devoted to a single lover.
PHILO. (apart).
0 Jupiter!
Why, what pest is this that has befallen my house ?
May all the Gods and Goddesses destroy me in the worst of fashions, if I don't kill this old hag with thirst, and hunger, and cold.
PHILE.
I don't want you, Scapha, to be giving me bad advice.
SCA.
You are clearly a simpleton, in thinking that he'll for everlasting be your friend and well-wisher.
I warn you of that ;
he'll forsake you by reason of age and satiety.
PHILE.
I hope not.
SCA.
Things which you don't hope happen more frequently than things which you do hope.
In fine, if you cannot be persuaded by words to believe this to be the truth, judge of my words from facts ;
consider this instance, who I now am, and who I once was.
No less than your are now, was I once beloved, and I devoted myself to one, who, faith, when with age this head changed its hue, forsook and deserted me.
Depend on it, the same will happen to yourself.
PHILO. (apart).
I can scarcely withhold myself from flying at the eyes of this mischief-maker.
PHILE.
I am of opinion that I ought to keep myself alone devoted to him, since to myself alone has he given freedom for himself alone.
PHILO. (apart).
0 ye immortal Gods!
what a charming woman, and of a disposition how chaste!
By heaven, 'tis excellently done, and I'm rejoiced at it, that it is for her sake I've got nothing left.
SCA.
On my word you really are silly.
PHILE.
For what reason ?
SCA.
Because you care for this, whether he loves you.
PHILE.
Prithee, why should I not care for it PSCA.
You now are free.
You've now got what you wanted ;
if he didn't still love you, as much money as he gave for your liberty, he'd lose.
PHILO. (apart).
Heavens,
I'm a dead man if I don't tor­ ture her to death after the most shocking fashion.
That evil-persuading enticer to vice is corrupting this damsel.
PHILO.
Scapha, I can never return him sufficient thanks for what he deserves of me;
don't you be persuading me to esteem him less.
SCA.
But take care and reflect upon this one thing, if you devote yourself to him alone, while now you are at this youthful age, your be complaining to no purpose in your aged years.
PHILO. (apart).
I could wish myself this instant changed into a quinsy, that I might seize the throat of that old witch, and put an end to the wicked mischief-maker.
PHILE.
It befits me now to have the same grateful feelings since I obtained it, as formerly before I acquired it, when I used to lavish caresses upon him.
PHILO. (apart).
May the Gods do towards me what they please, if for that speech I don't make you free over again, and if I don't torture Scapha to death.
SCA.
If you are quite assured that you will have a provi­ sion to the end, and that this lover will be your own for life, I think that you ought to devote yourself to him alone, and assume the character of a wife1.
PHILE.
Just as a person's character is, he's in the habit of finding means accordingly;
if I keep a good character for myself I shall be rich enough.
PHILO. (apart).
By my troth, since selling there must be, my father shall be sold much sooner than, while I'm alive, I'll ever permit you to be in want or go a-begging.
SCA.
What's to become of the rest of those who are in love with you ?
PHILE.
They'll love me the more when they see me display­ ing gratitude to one who has done me services.
PHILO. (apart).
I do wish that news were brought me now that my father's dead, that I might disinherit myself of my property, and that she might be my heir.
SCA.
This property of his will certainly soon be at an end;
day and night there's eating and drinking, and no one dis­ plays thriftiness;
'tis downright crammingl.
PHILO. (apart).
I' faith, I'm determined to make trial on yourself for the first to be thrifty;
for you shall neither eat nor drink anything at my house for the next ten days.
PHILE.
If you choose to say anything good about him, you shall be at liberty to say it;
if you speak otherwise than well, on my word you shall have a beating instantly.
PHILO. (apart).
Upon my faith, if I had paid sacrifice to supreme Jove with that money which I gave for her liberty, never could 1 have so well employed it.
Do see, how, from her very heart's core, she loves me!
Oh, I'm a fortunate man;
I've liberated in her a patron to plead my cause for me.
SCA..
I see that, compared with Philolaches, you disregard all other men;
now, that on his account I mayn't get a beating, I'll agree with you in preference, if you are quite satisfied that he will always prove a friend to you.
PHILE.
Give me the mirror2, and the casket with my trinkets, directly, Scapha, that I may be quite dressed when Philolaches, my delight, comes here.
SCA.
A woman who neglects herself and her youthful age has occasion for a mirror;
what need of a mirror have you, who yourself are in especial a mirror for a mirror.
PHILO. (apart).
For that expression, Scapha, that you mayn't have said anything so pretty in vain, I'll to-day give something for your savings-to you, my Philematium.
PHILE. (while SCAPHA is dressing her hair).
Will you see that each hair is nicely arranged in its own place ?
SCA.
When you yourself are so nice, do believe that your hair must be nice.
PHILO, (apart).
Out upon it!
what worse thing can pos- sibly be spoken of than this woman ?
-Now the jade's a flat­ terer, just now she was all contradictory.
PHILE.
Hand me the cerusel.
SCA.
Why, what need of ceruse have you ?
PHILE.
To paint my cheeks with it.
SCA.
On the same principle, you would want to be making ivory white with ink.
PHILO. (apart).
Cleverly said that, about the ink and the ivory!
Bravo!
I applaud you, Scapha.
PHILE.
Well then, do you give me the rouge.
SCA.
I shan't give it.
You really are a clever one.
Do you wish to patch up a most clever piece with new daubing ?
It's not right that any paint should touch that person, nei­ ther ceruse, nor quince-ointment, nor any other wash.
Take the mirror, then.
(Hands her the glass.)PHILO. (apart.)
Ah wretched me !—she gave the glass a kiss.
I could much wish for a stone, with which to break the head of that glass.
SCA.
Take the towel and wipe your hands.
PHILE.
Why so, prithee ?
SCA.
As you've been holding the mirror, I'm afraid that your hands may smell of silver;
lest Philolaches should sus­ pect you've been receiving silver somewhere.
PHILO. (apart).
I don't think that I ever did see anyone procuress more cunning.
How cleverly and artfully did it occur to the jade's imagination about the mirror!
PHILE.
Do you think I ought to be perfumed with unguents as well ?
SCA.
By no means do so.
PHILE.
For what reason ?
SCA.
Because, i' faith, a woman smells best2 when she smells of nothing at all.
For those old women who are in the habit of anointing themselves with unguents, vampt up crea­ tures, old hags, and toothless, who bide the blemishes of the person with paint, when the sweat has blended itself with .the unguents, forthwith they stink just like when a cook has poured together a variety of broths;
what they smell of, you don't know, except this only, that you understand that badly they do smell.
PHILO. (apart).
How very cleverly site does understand everything !
There's nothing more knowing than this know­ ing woman!
(To the AUDIENCE.)
This is the truth, and a very great portion, in fact, of you know it, who have old women for wives at home who purchased you with their por­ tions.
PHILE.
Come now, examine my golden trinkets and my mantle;
does this quite become me, Scapha ?
SCA.
It befits not me to concern myself about that.
PHILE.
Whom then, prithee ?SCA.
I'll tell you;
Philolaches;
so that he may not buy any­ thing except that which he fancies will please you.
For a lover buys the favours of a mistress for himself with gold and purple garments.
What need is there for that which he doesn't want as his own, to be shown him still ?
Age is to be enveloped in purple;
gold ornaments are unsuitable for a woman.
A beautiful woman will be more beautiful naked than drest in purple.
Besides, it's in vain she's well-drest if she's ill-conducted;
ill-conduct soils fine ornaments worse than dirt.
But if she's beauteous, she's sufficiently adorned.
PHILO. (apart).
Too long have I withheld my hand.
(Coming forward.)
What are you about here ?
PHILE.
I'm decking myself out to please you.
PHILO.
You are dressed enough.
( To SCAPHA.)
Go you hence in-doors, and take away this finery.
(SCAPHA goes into the house.)
But, my delight, my Philematium, I have a mind to regale together with you.
PHILE.
And, i' faith, so I have with you;
for what you have a mind to, the same have I a mind to, my delight.
PHILO.
Ha!
at twenty minæ that expression were cheap.
PHILE.
Give me ten, there's a dear;
I wish to let you have that expression bought a bargain.
PHILO.
You've already got ten minæ with you;
or reckon up the account:
thirty minæ I gave for your freedom——PHILE.
Why reproach me with that ?
PHILO.
What, I reproach you with it ?
Why, I had ra­ ther that I myself were reproached with it;
no money what­ ever for this long time have I ever laid out equally well.
PHILE.
Sorely, in loving you, I never could have better employed my pains.
PHILO.
The account, then, of receipts and expenditure fully tallies between ourselves;
you love me, I love you.
Each thinks that it is so deservedly.
Those who rejoice at this, may they ever rejoice at the continuance of their own happiness.
Those who envy, let not any one henceforth be ever envious of their blessings.
PHILE. (pointing to a couch on the stage).
Come, take your place, then.
(At the door, to a SERVANT, who obeys.)
Boy, bring some water for the hands ;
put a little table here.
See where are the dice.
Would you like some perfumes ?
(They recline on the couch.)PHILO.
What need is there ?
Along with myrrh I am reclining.
But isn't this my friend who's coming hither with his mistress ?
'Tis he;
it's Callidamates ;
look, he's coming.
Capital!
my sweet one, see, our comrades are approaching;
they're coming to share the spoil.
CALL. (to his SERVANT).
I want you to come for me1 in good time to the house of Philolaches;
listen you;
well then!
those are your orders.
(Exit SERVANT.)
For from the place where I was, thence did I betake myself off;
so confoundedly tired was I there with the entertainment and the discourse.
Now I'll go to Philolaches to have a bout there he'll receive us with jovial feelings and handsomely.
Do I seem to you to be fairly drenched, my bubsy ?
DEL.
You ought always to live pursuing this course of life,CALL.
Should you like, then, for me to hug you, and you me ?
DEL.
If you've a mind to do so, of course.
CALL.
You are a charming one.
(He stumbles.)
Do hold me up, there's a dear.
DEL. (holding him, by the arm).
Take care you don't fall.
Stand up.CALL. 0 ! you are the apple of my eye.
I'm your foster­ ling, my honey.
(He stumbles.)DEL. (still holding him up).
Only do take care that you don't recline in the street, before we get to a place where a couch is ready laid.
CALL.
Do let me fall.
DEL.
Well, I'll let you.
(Lets go.)CALL. (dragging her as he falls).
But that as well which I've got hold of in my hand.
DEL.
If you fall, you shan't fall without me falling with you.
Then some one shall pick us both up as we lie (Aside.)
The man's quite drenched.
CALL. (overhearing).
Do you say that I am drenched, my bubsy ?
DEL.
Give me your hand;
I really do not want * * you hurt.
CALL. (giving his hand).
There now, take it.
DEL.
Come, move on with me.
CALL.
Where am I going, do you know ?
DEL.
I know.
CALL.
It has just come into my head:
why, of course I'm going home for a booze.
DEL.
Why yes, really now I do remember that.
PHILO.
Won't you let me go to find them, my life?
Of all persons I wish well to him especially.
I'll return just now.
(Goes forward towards the door.)PHILE.
That just now" is a long time to me.
CALL. (going to the door and knocking).
Is there any per­ son here?
CALL. (turning round).
Bravo!
Philolaches, good day to you, most friendly to me of all men.
PHILO.
May the Gods bless you.
(Pointing to a couch.)
Take your place, Callidamates.
(He takes his place.)
Whence are you betaking yourself ?
CALL.
Whence a drunken man does.
PHILO.
Well said.
But, my Delphium, do take your place, there's a dear.
(She takes her place on a couch.)CALL.
Give her something to drink.
I shall go to sleep directly.
(Nods and goes to sleep.)
PHILO.
He doesn't do anything wonderful or strange.
What shall I do with him then, my dear ?
DEL.
Let him alone just as he is.
PHILO.
Come,you boy.
Meanwhile, speedily pass the goblet round, beginning with Delphium.
TEA. (to himself).
Supreme Jove, with all his might and resources, is seeking for me and Philolaches, my master's son, to be undone.
Our hopes are destroyed ;
nowhere is there any hold for courage;
not even Salvationl now could save us if she wished.
Such an immense mountain of woe have I just now seen at the harbour:
my master has arrived from abroad;
Tranio is undone!
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Is there any person who'd like to make gain of a little money, who could this day endure to take my place in being tortured ?
Where are those fellows hardened to a flogging, the wearers­ out of iron chains, or those, who, for the consideration of three didrachms, would get beneath besieging towers2, where some are in the way of having their bodies pierced with fifteen spears ?
I'll give a talent to that man who shall be the first to run to the cross for me;
but on condition that twice his feet, twice his arms3 are fastened there.
When that shall have been done, then ask the money down of me.
But am I not a wretched fellow, not at full speed to be running home ?
PHILO.
Here come the provisions;
see, here's Tranio;
he'a come back from the harbour.
TRA. (running).
Philolaches!
PHILO.
What's the matter ?
TEA.
Both I and youPHILO.
What about " Both I and you ?"TEA.
Are undone!
PHILO.
Why so ?
TEA.
Your father's here.
PHILO.
What is it I hear of you ?
TRA.
We are finished up.
Your father's come, I say.
PHILO.
(starting up.)
Where is he, I do entreat you ?
TRA.
He's coming.
PHILO.
Coming?
Who says so?
Who has seen him ?
TRA.
I saw him myself, I tell you.
PHILO.
Woe unto me!
what am I about ?
TRA.
Why the plague now do you ask me what you are about ?
Taking your place at table, of course.
PHILO.
Did you see him ?
TRA.
I my own self, I tell you.
PHILO.
For certain ?
TRA.
For certain, I tell you.
PHILO.
I'm undone, if you are telling the truth.
TRA.
What good could it be to me if I told a lie ?
TRA.
(pointing to the table and couches).
Order all these things to be removed from here.
(Pointing.)
Who's that asleep there ?
DEL.
(bawling out in his ear).
Callidamates!
Callidamates!
awake!
CALL. (raising himself a little).
I am awake;
give me something to drink.
DEL.
Awake;
the father of Philolaches has arrived from abroad.
CALL.
I hope his father's well.
PHILO.
He is well indeed;
but I am utterly undone.
CALL.
You, utterly undone ?
How can that be ?
PHILO.
By heavens!
do get up, I beg of you;
my father has arrived.
CALL.
Your father has come ?
Bid him go back again.
What business had he to come back here so soon ?
PHILO.
What am I to do ?
My father will, just now, be coming and unfortunately finding me amid drunken carousals, and the house full of revellers and women.
It's a shocking bad job, to be digging a well at the last moment, just when thirst has gained possession of your throat;
just as I. on the arrival of my father, wretch that I am, am now enquiring what I am to do.
TRA. (pointing at CALLIDAMATES).
Why look, he has laid down his head and gone to sleep.
Do arouse him.
PHILO.
(shaking him).
Will you awake now ?
My father, I tell you, will be here this instant.
CALL.
How say you ?
Your father ?
Give me my shoes, that I may take up arms.
On my word, I'll kill your father this instant.
PHILO. (seizing hold of him).
You're spoiling the whole business;
do hold your tongue.
(To DELPHIUM.)
Prithee, do carry him off in your arms into the house.
CALL.
(To DELPHIUM, who is lifting him up).
Upon my faith, I'll be making an utensil of you just now, if you don't find me one.
(He is led off into the house.)
PHILO.
I'm undone!
TRA.
Be of good courage;
I'll cleverly find a remedy for this alarm.
PHILO.
I'm utterly ruined!
TRA.
Do hold your tongue;
I'll think of something by means of which to alleviate this for you.
Are you satisfied, if on his arrival I shall so manage your father, not only that he shall not enter, but even that he shall run away to a distance from the house ?
Do you only be off from here in-doors, and remove these things from here with all haste.
PHILO.
Where am I to be ?
TRA.
Where you especially desire:
with her (pointing to PHILEMATIUM) ;
with this girl, too, you'll be.
(Pointing to DELPHIUM.)DEL.
How then ?
Are we to go away from here ?
TRA.
Not far from here, Delphium.
For carouse away in the house not a bit the less on account of this.
PHILO.
Ah me!
I'm in a sweat with fear as to how these fine words are to end !
TRA.
Can you not be tranquil in your mind, and do as I bid you ?
PHILO.
I can be.
TRA.
In the first place of all, Phile­ matium, do you go in-doors;
and you, Delphium.
DEL.
We'll both be obedient to you.
(They go into the house.)TRA.
May Jupiter grant it so!
Now then, do you give attention as to what I'd have attended to.
In the first place, then, before anything, cause the house to be shut up at once.
Take care and don't let any one whisper a word in- doors.
PHILO.
Care shall be taken.
TEA.
Just as though no living being were dwelling within the house.
I PHILO.
Very well.
TEA.
And let no one answer, when the old gentleman knocks at the door.
PHILO.
Anything else ?
TRA.
Order the master-key1 of the house to be brought me at once from within;
this house I'll lock here on the outside.-
PHILO.
To your charge I commit myself, Tranio, and my hopes.
(He goes into the home, and the things are removed from the stage.)TRA. (to himself).
It matters not a feather whether a patron or a dependant is the nearest at hand for that man who has got no courage in his breast.
For to every man, whe­ ther very good or very bad, even at a moment's notice, it is easy to act with craft;
but this must be looked to, this is the duty of a prudent man, that what has been planned and done in craftiness, may all come about smoothly and without mishap;
so that he may not have to put up with anything by reason of which he might be loth to live;
just as I shall manage, that, from the confusion which we shall here create, all shall really go on smoothly and tranquilly, and not produce us any inconvenience in the results.
(Enter a Box, from the house.)
But, why have you come out ?
l'in undone!
(The Box shows him the key.) 0 very well, you've obeyed my orders most opportunely.
Box.
He bade me most earnestly to entreat you some way or other to scare away his father, that he may not enter the house.
TRA.
Even more, tell him this, that I'll cause that he shan't venture even to look at the house, and to take to flight, covering up his head1 with the greatest alarm.
Give me the key (taking it), and be off in-doors, and shut to the door, and I'll lock it on this side.
(The Box goes into the house, and TRANIO locks the door.)
Bid him now come forthwith.
For the old gentleman here while still alive this day will I institute games2 in his presence, such as I fancy there will never be for him when he's dead.
(Moving away.)
I'll go away from the door to this spot;
hence, I'll look out afar in which direction to lay the burden on the old fellow on his arrival.
(Exit to a little distance.)THEU. (to himself).
Neptune, I do return extreme thanks to thee that thou hast just dismissed me from thee, though scarce alive.
But if, from this time forward, thou shalt only know that I have stirred a foot upon the main, there is no reason why, that instant, thou shouldst not do with me that which thou hast now wished to do.
Away with you, away with you from me henceforth for ever after to-day;
what I was to entrust to thee, all of it have I now entrusted.
TRA. (apart).
By my troth, Neptune, you've been much to blame, to have lost this opportunity so fair.
THEU.
After three years, I've arrived home from Egypt..
I shall come a welcome guest to my household, I suppose.
TRA. (apart).
Upon my faith, he might have come a much more welcome one, who had brought the tidings you were dead.
THEU.
(looking at the door).
But what means this?
Is the door shut in the daytime ?
I'll knock.
(Knocks at the door.)
Hallo, there!
is any one going to open this door for me?
TRA. (coming forward, and speaking aloud).
What person is it that has come so near to our house PTHEU.
Surely this is my servant Tranio.
TRA.
0 Tbeuropides, my master, welcome ;
I'm glad that you've arrived in safety.
Have you been well all along ?
THEU.
All along, as you see.
TRA.
That's very good.
THEU.
What about yourselves ?
Are you all mad PTHEU.
For this reason;
because you are walking about outside ;
not a born person is keeping watch in the house,, either to open or to give an answer.
With kicking witn my feet I've almost broken in the pannels ?
TRA.
How now ?
Have you been touching this house PTHEU.
Why shouldn't I touch it P Why, with kicking :
.t, I tell you, I've almost broken down the door.
THEU.
I touched it, I tell you, and knocked at it.
TRA.
By heavens!
'twas ill done.
THEU.
What is the matter ?
TRA.
It cannot be expressed how shocking and dreadful a mischief you've been guilty of.
TRA.
Take to flight, I beseech you, and get away from the house.
Fly in this direction, fly closer to me.
(He runs to wards TRANIO.)
What, did you touch the door ?
THEU.
How could I knock, if I didn't touch it ?
TRA.
By all that's holy, you've been the deathTHEU.
Of what person ?
TRA.
Of all your family.
THEU.
May the Gods and Goddesses confound you with that omen.
TRA.
I'm afraid that you can't make satisfaction for your.
self and them.
THEU.
For what reason, or what new affair is this that you thus suddenly bring me news of?
TRA.
And (whispering) hark you, prithee, do bid those people to move away from here.
(Pointing to the AT­ TENDANTS of THEUROPIDES.)THEU. (to the ATTENDANTS).
Move away from here.
TRA.
Don't you touch the house.
Touch you the ground1 as well.
(Exeunt the ATTENDANTS.
THEU.
I' faith, prithee, do speak out now.
TRA.
Because it is now seven months that not a person has set foot within this house, and since we once for all left it.
THEU.
Tell me, why so ?
TRA.
Just look around, whether there's any person to overhear our discourse.
THEU. (looking around).
All's quite safe.
TRA.
Look around once more.
THEU. (looking around).
There's nobody;
now then, speak out.
TRA. (in a loud whisper).
The house has been guilty of a capital offence2.
THEU.
I don't understand you.
TRA.
A crime, I tell you,has been committed there, a long while ago, one of olden time and ancient date.
THEU.
Of ancient date P TRA.
'Tis but recently, in fact, that we've discovered this deed.
THEU.
What is this crime, or who committed it ?
Tell me.
TRA.
A host slew his guest, seized with his hand;
he, I fancy, who sold you the house.
THEU.
Slew him ?
TRA.
And robbed this guest of his gold, and buried this guest there in the house, on the spot.
THEU.
For what reason do you suspect that this took place ?
TRA.
I'll tell you;
listen.
One day, when your son had dined away from home, after he returned home from dining;
we all went to bed, and fell asleep.
By accident, I had forgotten to put out my lamp;
and he, all of a sudden, called out aloudTHEU.
What person ?
My son ?
TRA.
Hist!
hold your peace:
just listen.
He said that a dead man came to him in his sleepTHEU.
In his dreams, then, you mean ?
TRA.
Just so.
But only listen.
He said that he had met with his death by these meansTHEU.
What, in his sleep ?
TRA.
It would have been surprising if he had told him awake, who had been murdered sixty years ago.
On some occasions you are absurdly simple.
But look, what he said:
" I am the guest of Diapontius, from beyond the seas;
here do I dwell;
this has been assigned me as my abode;
for Orcus would not receive me in Acheron, because prematurely I lost my life.
Through confiding was I deceived:
my enter­ tainer slew me here, and that villain secretly laid me in the ground without funereal rites, in this house, on the spot, for the sake of gold.
Now do you depart from here;
this house is accursed, this dwelling is defiled."
The wonders that here take place, hardly in a year could I recount them.
Hush, hush!
(He starts.)THEU.
Troth now, what has happened, prithee ?
TRA.
The door made a noise.
Was it he that was knocking ?
THEU. (turning pale).
I have not one drop of blood \
Dead men are come to fetch me to Acberon, while alive !TRA. (aside).
I'm undone!
those people there will mar my plot.
(A noise is heard from within.)
How much I dread, lest he should catch me in the fact.
THEU.
What are you talking about to yourself?
(Goes near the door.)TRA.
Do get away from the door.
By heavens, fly, I do beseech you.
THEU.
Fly where ?
Fly yourself, as well.
TRA.
I am not afraid :
I am at peace with the dead.
A VOICE (from within).
Hallo!
Traniol.
TRA. (in a low voice, near the door).
You won't be calling me, if you are wise.
(Aloud, as if speaking to the APPARI­ TION.)
'Tis not I that's guilty;
I did not knock at the door.
THEU.
Pray, what is it that's wrong?
What matter is agitating you, Tranio ?
To whom are you saying these things ?
TRA.
Prithee, was it you that called me ?
So may the Gods bless me, I fancied it was this dead man expostulating because you had knocked at the door.
But are you still standing there, and not doing what I advise you ?
THEU.
What am I to do ?
TRA..
Take care not to look back.
Fly;
cover up your head!
THEU.
Why don't you fly ?
TRA.
I am at peace with the dead.
THEU.
I recollect.
Why then were you so dreadfully alarmed just now ?
TRA.
Have no care for me, I tell you;
I'll see to myself.
You, as you have begun to do, fly as quick as ever you can;
Hercules, too2, you will invoke.
TRA. (to himself.)
And I, as well, old fellow, that this day he'll send some heavy mishap upon you.
0 ye immortal Gods, I do implore your aid.
Plague on it!
what a mess I have got into to-day.
(-Exit.BAN. (to himself).
I never knew any year worse for money upon interest, than this year has turned out to me.
From morning even until night, I spend my time in the Forum;
I cannot lend out a coin of silver to any one.
TRA. (apart).
Now, faith, I am clearly undone in an everlasting way!
The Banker's here who found the money with which his mistress was bought.
The matter's all out, unless I meet him a bit beforehand, so that the old man may not at present come to know of this.
I'll go meet him.
But (seeing THEUROPIDES) I wonder why he has so soon be­ taken himself homeward again.
I'm afraid that he has heard something about this affair.
I'll meet him, and accost him.
But how dreadfully frightened I am!
Nothing is more wretched than the mind of a man with a guilty con­ science, such as possesses myself.
But however this matter turns out, I'll proceed to perplex it still further:
so does this affair require.
TRA. (accosting him).
Whence come you ?
THEU.
I met that person from whom I bought this house.
TRA.
Did you tell him anything about that which I was telling you ?
THEU.
I' faith, I certainly told him everything.
TRA. (aside).
Woe to unfortunate me!
I'm afraid that my schemes are everlastingly undone!
THEU.
What is it you are saying to yourself ?
TRA.
Why nothing.
But tell me, prithee, did you really tell him ?
THEU.
I told him everything in its order, I tell you.
TRA.
Does he, then, confess about the guest ?
THEU.
Why no ;
he utterly denies it.
TRA.
Does he deny it ?
THEU.
Do you ask me again?
I should tell you if he had confessed it.
What now are you of opinion a ught to be done ?
TRA.
What is my opinion ?
By my troth, I beg of you, appoint an arbitrator together with him;
but take you care that you appoint one who will believe me;
you'll overcome him as easily as a fox eats a pearl.
BAN. (to himself).
But see, here's Tranio, the servant of Philolaches, people who pay me neither interest nor prin­ cipal on my money.
(Goes towards TRANIO, who steps for­ ward to meet him.)THEU. (to TRANIO).
Whither are you betaking yourself?
TRA.
I'm going no whither.
(Aside.)
For sure, I am a wretch, a rascal, one born with all the Gods,my foes!
He'll now be accosting me in the old man's presence.
Assuredly, I am a wretched man;
in such a fashion both this way and that do they find business for me.
But I'll make haste and accost him.
(-Moves towards the BANKER.)BAN. (apart).
He's coming towards me.
I'm all right I've some hopes of my money;
he's smiling.
TRA. (to himself).
The fellow's deceived.
(To the BANKER.
I heartily bid you hail, my friend Saturides2.
BAN.
And hail to you.
What about the money ?
TRA.
Be off with you, will you, you brute.
Directly you come, you commence the attackS against me.
BAN. (apart).
This fellow's empty-handed.
TRA. (overhearing him).
This fellow's surely a conjurer.
BAN.
But why don't you put an end to this trifling ?
TRA.
Tell me, then, what it is you want.
BAN.
Where is Philolaches ?
TRA.
You never could have met me more opportunely than you have met me.
BAN.
How's that ?
TRA. (taking him aside).
Step this way.
BAN. (aloud).
Why isn't the money repaid me ?
TiA.
I know that you have a good voice ;
don't bawl out so loud.
BAN. (aloud).
I' faith, I certainly shall bawl out.
TRA.
0, do humour me now.
BAN.
What do you want me to humour you in ?
TRA.
Prithee, be off hence home.
BAN.
Be off ?
TRA.
Return here about mid-day.
BAN.
Will the interest be paid then ?
TRA.
It will be paid.
Be off.
BAN.
Why should I run to and fro here, or use or waste my pains ?
What if I remain here until mid-day in pre­ ference ?
TRA.
Why no;
be off home.
On my word, I'm telling the truth.
Only do be off.
BAN. (aloud).
Then do you pay me my interest.
Why do you trifle with me this way ?
TRA.
Bravo !
faith.
Really now, do be off;
do attend to me.
BAN. (aloud).
I' faith, I'll call him now by name.
TRA.
Bravo!
stoutly done!
Really you are quite rich now when you bawl out.
BAN. (aloud).
I'm asking for my own.
In this way you've been disappointing me for these many days past.
If I'm troublesome, give me back the money;
I'll go away then.
That expression1 puts an end to all replies.
TRA. (pretending to offer it him).
Then, take the prin­ cipal2.
BAN. (aloud).
Why no, the interest;
I want that first.
TRA.
What ?
Have you, you fellow most foul of all fel­ lows, come here to burst yourself?
Do what lies in your power.
He's not going to pay you ;
he doesn't owe it.
BAN.
Not owe it?
TRA.
Not a tittle, indeed, can you get from here.
Would you prefer for him to go abroad, and leave the city in exile, driven hence for your sake ?
Why then, in preference let him pay the3 principal.
BAN.
But I don't ask for it.
THEU.
(calling out to TRANIO, from a distance).
Hark you !
you whip-knave, come back to me.
TRA. (to THEUROPIDES).
I'll be there just now.
(To the BANKER.)
Don't you be troublesome:
no one'a going to pay you;
do what you please.
You are the only person, I suppose, that lends money upon interest.
(Moves towards THEUROPIDES.)BAN. (bawling aloud).
Give me my interest!
pay me my interest!
you pay my interest!
Are you going to give me my interest this instant ?
Give me my interest!
TRA.
Interest here, interest there!
The old rogue knows how to talk about nothing but interest.
I do not think that ever I saw any beast more vile than you.
BAN.
Upon my faith, you don't alarm me now with those expressions.
This is of a hot nature;
although it is at a distance off, it scorches badly1.
TRA.
Don't you be troublesome;
no one's going to pay you;
do what you please.
You are the only person, I sup­ pose, that lends money upon interest.
THEU. (to TRANIO).
Pray, what interest is this that he is asking for ?
TRA.
(in a low voice, to the BANKER).
Look now;
his father has arrived from abroad, not long since;
he'll pay you both interest and principal;
don't you then attempt any further to make us your enemies.
See whether he puts you off.
BAN.
Nay but, I'll take it, if anything's offered.
THEU. (to TRANIO, coming towards him).
What do you say, then?
TRA.
What is it you mean ?
THEU.
Who is this ?
What is he asking for ?
Why is he thus rudely speaking of my son Philolaches in this way, and giving you abuse to your face ?
What's owing him ?
TRA. (to THEUROPIDES).
I beg of you, do order the money to be thrown in the face of this dirty brute.
THEU.
I, order it ?
TRA.
Order the fellow's face to be pelted with money.
BAN. (coming nearer).
I could very well put up with a pelting with money.
THEU. (to TRANIO).
What money's this ?
TRA.
Philolaches owes this person a little.
THEU.
How much ?
TRA.
About forty minæ.
BAN. (to THEUROPIDES).
Really, don't think much of that;
it's a trifle, in fact.
TRA.
Don't you hear him Troth now, prithee, doesn't he seem just suited to be a Banker-a generation that's most roguish ?
THEU.
I don't care, just now, for that, who he is or whence he is;
this I want to be told me, this I very much wish to know—I heard from him that there was interest owing on the money as well.
TRA.
Forty-four minæ are due to him.
Say that you'll pay it, that he may be off.
THEU.
I, say that I'll pay it ?
TRA.
Do say so.
THEU.
What, I ?TRA.
You yourself.
Do only say so.
Do be guided by me.
Do promise.
Come now, I say;
I beg of you.
THEU.
Answer me;
what has been done with this money ?
TRA.
It's safe.
THEU.
Pay it yourselves then, if it's safe.
TRA.
Your son has bought a house.
THEU.
A house ?
TRA.
A house.
THEU.
Bravo!
Philolaches is taking after his father!
The fellow now turns to merchandize.
A house, say you?
TRA.
A house, I tell you.
But do you know of what sort ?
THEU.
How can I know ?
TRA.
Out with you!
THEU.
What's the matter ?
TRA.
Don't ask me that.
THEU.
But why so ?
TRA.
Bright as a mirror, pure brilliancy itself.
THEU.
Excellently done, upon my faith!
Well, how much did he agree to give for it ?
TRA.
As many great talents as you and I put together make;
but these forty minæ he paid by way of earnest.
(Pointing to the BANKER.)
From him he received what we paid the other man.
Do you quite understand1 P For after this house was in s".ch a state as I mentioned to you, he ac once purchased another house for himself.
THEU.
Excellently done, upon my faith!
BAN. (touching TRANIO).
Hark you.
Mid-day is now close at hand.
TRA.
Prithee, do dismiss this puking fellow, that he mayn't worry us to death.
Forty-four minæ are due to him, both principal and interest.
BAN.
'Tis just that much;
I ask for nothing more.
TRA.
Upon my faith, I really could have wished that you had asked more, if only by a single coin.
THEU. (to the BANKER).
Young man, transact the business with me.
BAN.
I'm to ask it of you, you mean ?
THEU.
Come for it to-morrow.
BAN.
I'll be off, then;
I'm quite satisfied if I get it to- morrow.
(Exit.TRA. (aside).
A plague may all the Gods and Goddesses send upon him!
so utterly has he disarranged my plans.
On my word, no class of men is there more disgusting, or less acquainted with fair dealing than the banking race.
THEU.
In what neighbourhood did my son buy this house ?TRA. (aside).
Just see that, now!
I'm undone!
THEU.
Are you going to tell me that which I ask you ?
TRA.
I'll tell you;
but I'm thinking what was the name of the owner.
(-Pretends to think.)
THEU.
Well, call it to mind, then.
TRA. (aside).
What am I to do now, except put the lie upon this neighbour of ours next door ?
I'll say that his son has bought that house.
I' faith, I've heard say that a lie piping-hot is the best lie ;
this is piping-hot;
although it is at a distance off, it scorches badly.
Whatever the Gods dictate, that am I determined to say.
THEU.
Well now ?
Have you recollected it by this ?TRA. (aside).
May the Gods confound that fellow!
-no this other fellow, rather.
(To THEUROPIDES.)
Your son has bought the house of this next-door neighbour of yours.
THEU.
In real truth ?
TRA.
If, indeed, you are going to pay down the money, then in real truth;
if you are not going to pay it, in real truth he has not bought it.
THEU.
He hasn't bought it in a very good situation.
TRA.
Why yes, in a very good one.
THEU.
I’ faith, I should like to look over this house;
just knock at the door, and call some one to you from within, Tranio.TRA. (aside).
Why just look now, again I don't know what I'm to say.
Once more, now, are the surges bearing me upon the self-same rock.
What now P I' faith, I can't dis­ cover what I am now to do;
I'm caught in the fact.
THEU.
Just call some one out of doors;
ask him to show us round.
TRA. (going to the door of SIMO’S house).
Hallo there, you!
(Turning round)
But there are ladies here;
we must first see whether they are willing or unwilling.
THEU.
You say what's good and proper;
just make enquiry, and ask.
I'll wait here outside until you come out.
TRA. (aside).
May all the Gods and Goddesses utterly confound you, old gentleman!
in such a fashion are you thwarting my artful plans in every way.
Bravo!
very good!
Look,
Simo himself, the owner of the house, is coming out of doors.
I'll step aside here, until I have con­ vened the senate of council in my mind.
Then, when I've discovered what I am to do, I'll join him.
(THEUROPIDES and TRANIO stand at a distancefrom STMO'S house, in opposite directions, THEUBOPIDES being out of sight.)SIM. (to himself).
I've not enjoyed myself better at home this year than I have to-day, nor has at any time any meal pleased me better.
My wife provided a very nice breakfast for me;
now she bids me go take a nap.
By no means!
It instantly struck me that it didn't so happen by chance.
She provided a better breakfast than is her wont;
and then, the old lady wanted to draw me away to my chamber.
Sleep is not good1 after breakfast-out upon it!
I secretly stole away from the house, out of doors.
My wife, I'm sure, is now quite bursting with rage at home.
TRA. (apart).
A sore mischance is provided for this old fellow by the evening;
for he must both dine and go to bed in-doors in sorry fashion.
SIM. (continuing).
The more I reflect upon it in my mind:
if any person has a downed wife, sleep has no charms for him.
I detest going to take a nap.
It's a settled matter with me to be off to the Forum from here, rather than nap it at home.
And, i' faith (to the AUDIENCE), I don't know how your wives are in their behaviour;
this wife of mine, I know right well how badly she treats me, and that she will prove more annoying to me hereafter than she has been.
TRA. (apart).
If your escape, old gentleman, turns out amiss, there'll be no reason for you to be accusing any one of the Gods;
by very good right, you may justly lay the blame upon yourself.
It's time now for me to accost this old fellow.
'Tis down upon him1.
I've hit upon a plan whereby to cajole the old fellow, by means of which to drive grief2 away from me.
I'll accost him.
(Accosting him.)
May the Gods, Simo, Bend on you many blessings!
(Takes him by the hand.)SIM.
Not amiss.
What are you about ?
TRA.
Holding by the hand a very worthy man.
SIM.
You act in a friendly way, in speaking well of me.
TRA.
It certainly is your due.
SIM.
But, i' faith, in you I don't hold a good servant by the hand.
THEU.
(calling from a distance, where he is not perceived by SIMO).
Hark you!
you whip-knave, come back to me.
TRA. (turning round).
I'll be there just now.
SIM.
Well now, how soon?
TRA.
What is it ?
SIM.
The usual goings-on.
TRA.
Tell me then, these usual goings-on, what are they ?
SlM.
The way that you yourselves proceed.
But, Tranio, to say the truth, according as men are, it so befits you to humour them ;
reflecting, at the same time, how short life is.
TRA.
What of all this ?
Dear me, at last, after some diffi- culty, I perceive that you are talking about these goings-on of ours.
SlM.
I' faith, you people are living a merry life, just as befits you:
on wine, good cheer, nice dainty fish, you enjoy life.
TRA.
Why yes, so it was in time past, indeed;
but now these things have come to an end all at once.
SIM.
How so ?
TRA.
So utterly, Simo, are we all undone !
SIM.
Won't you hold your tongue ?
Everything has gone on prosperously with you hitherto.
TRA.
I don't deny that it has been as you say ;
undoubt­ edly, we have lived heartily, just as we pleased;
but, Simo, in such a way has the breeze now forsaken our shipSIM.
What's the matter ?
In what way?
TRA.
In a most shocking way.
SlM. What, wasn't it hauled ashore1 in safety ?
TRA.
Ah me!
SIM.
What's the matter?
TRA.
Ah wretched me!
I'm utterly undone!
SIM.
How so ?
TRA.
Because a ship has come, to smash the hull of our ship.
SIM.
I would wish as you would wish, Tranio, for your own sake.
But what is the matter ?
Do inform me.
TRA.
I will inform you.
My master has arrived from abroad.
SIM.
In that case, the cord will be stretched for you;
thence to the place where iron fetters clink;
after that, straight to the cross.
TRA.
Now, by your knees, I do implore you, don't give information to my master.
SIM.
Don't you fear;
he shall know nothing from me.
SIM.
I don't care for clients of this description for myself.
TRA.
Now as to this about which our old gentleman has sent me.
SIM.
First answer me this that I ask you.
As yet, has your old gentleman discovered anything of these matters ?
SIM.
Has he censured his son at all ?
TERi.
He is as calm as the calm weather is wont to be.
Now he has requested me most earnestly to beg this of you, that leave may be given him to see over this house of yours.
SIM.
It's not for sale.
TRA.
I know that indeed;
but the old gentleman wishes to build a woman's apartment1 here in his own house, baths, too, and a piazza, and a porch.
SIM.
What has he been dreaming of ?
TRA.
I'll tell you.
He wishes to give his son a wife as soon as he can;
for that purpose he wants a new apartment for the women.
But he says that some builder, I don't know who, has been praising up to him this house- of yours, as being remarkably well built;
now he's desirous to take a model from it, if you don't make any objection——SIM.
Indeed, he is really choosing a plan for himself from a piece of poor workmanship.
TRA.
It was because he heard that here the summer heat was much modified;
that this house was wont to be inhabited each day all day long.
SIM.
Why really, upon my faith, on the contrary, while there's shade in every direction, in spite of it, the sun is always here from morning till night:
he stands, like a dun, continually at the door;
and I have no shade anywhere, unless, perhaps, there may be some in the well.
TRA.
Well now, have you one from Sarsina, if you have no woman of Umbria2 ?
SIM.
Don't be impertinent.
It is just as I tell you.
TRA.
Still, he wishes to look over it.
SIM.
He may look over it, if he likes.
If there is any­ thing that takes his fancy, let him build after my plan.
TRA.
Am I to go and call this person hither ?
SIM.
Go and call him.
TRA. (to himself, as he goes to the other side of the stage to call THEUROPlDES).
They say that Alexander the Great and Agathocles1 achieved two very great exploits;
what shall be the lot of myself, a third, who, unaided, am achieving deeds imperishable ?
This old fellow is carrying his pack-saddle, the other one, as well.
I've hit upon a novel trade for my­ self, not a bad one;
whereas muleteers have mules to carry pack-saddles;
I've got men to carry the pack-saddles.
They are able to carry heavy burdens;
whatever you put upon them, they carry.
Now, I don't know whether I am to address him.
I'll accost him, however.
(Calling aloud.)
Hark you, Theuropides!
THEU.
(coming forward).
Well;
who's calling me?
TRA.
A servant most attached to his master.
Where you sent me, I got it all agreed to.
THEU.
Prithee, why did you stay there so long ?
TRA.
The old gentleman hadn't leisure;
I was waiting until then.
THEU.
You keep up that old way of yours, of being tardy.
TRA.
Hark you!
if you please reflect upon this proverb:
to blow and swallow2 at the same moment isn't easy to be done;
I couldn't be here and there at the same time.
TRA.
Come and look, and inspect it at your own pleasure.
THEU.
Very well, you go before me.
TRA.
Am I delaying to do so ?
THEU.
I'll follow after you.
TRA. (as they advance).
Look, the old gentleman himself is awaiting you before the door, but he is concerned that he has sold this house.
TRA.
He begs me to persuade Philolaches to let him off.
THEU.
I don't think he will.
Each man reaps on his own farmS.
If it had been bought dear, we shouldn't have had permission to return it on his hands.
Whatever profit there is, it's proper to bring it home.
It don't, now-a-days, befit men to be showing compassion.
TRA.
I' faith, you are losing time while you are talking.
Follow me.
THEU.
Be it so.
TRA. (to THEUROPIDES).
I'll give you my services.
(Pointing.)
There's the old gentleman.
(To SIMO.)
Well now, I've brought you this person.
SIM.
l'in glad that you've arrived safely from abroad, Theuropides.
THEU.
May the Gods bless you.
SIM.
Your servant was telling me that you were desirous to look over this house.
THEU.
Unless it's inconvenient to you.
SIM.
Oh no;
quite convenient.
Do step in-doors and look over it.
THEU. (pausing).
But yet-the ladiesSIM.
Take you care not to trouble yourself a straw about any lady.
Walk in every direction, wherever you like, all over the house, just as though it were your own.
THEU. (apart to TRANIO).
" Just as though ?"TRA. (whispering).
Oh, take care that you don't throw it in his teeth now in his concern, that you have bought it.
Don't you see him, how sad a countenance the old gentleman has ?
THEU. (apart).
I see. TRA. (apart).
Then don't seem to exult, and to be overmuch delighted;
in fact, don't make mention that you've bought it.
THEU. (apart).
I understand;
and I think you've given good advice, and that it shows a humane disposition.
(Turning to SIMO.)
What now ?
SIM.
Won't you go in?
Look over it at your leisure, just as you like.
THEU.
I consider that you are acting civilly and kindly.
SIM.
Troth, I wish to do so.
Should you like some one to show you over.
THEU.
Away with any one to show1 me over.
I don't want him.
SIM.
Why?
What's the matter?
THEU.
I'll go wrong, rather than any one should show me over.
TRA. (pointing).
Don't you see, this vestibule before the house, and the piazza, of what a compass it is ?
THEU.
Troth, really handsome!
TRA.
Well, look now, what pillars there are, with what strength they are built, and of what a thickness.
THEU.
I don't think that I ever saw handsomer pillars.
SIM.
I' faith, they were some time since bought by me at such a price!
TRA. (aside, whispering).
Don't you hear—
“They were once "?
He seems hardly able to refrain from tears.
THEU.
At what price did you purchase them PSIM.
I gave three minæ for the two, besides the carriage.
(He retires to some distance.)THEU.
(after looking close at them, to TRANIO).
Why, upon my word, they are much more unsound than I thought them at first.
TRA.
Why so ?
THEU.
Because, i' faith, the woodworm has split them both from the bottom.
TRA.
I think they were cut at an improper season;
that fault damages them;
but even as it is, they are quite good enough, if they are covered with pitch.
But it was no foreign pulse-eating artisan1 did this work.
Don't you see the joints in the door ?
(Pointing.)THEU.
I see them.
TRA.
Look, how close together they are sleeping.
THEU.
Sleeping?
TRA.
That is, how they wink, I in­ tended to say.
Are you satisfied ?
THEU.
The more I look at each particular, the more it pleases me.
TRA. (pointing).
Don't you see the painting, where one crow2 is baffling two vultures ?
The crow stands there;
it's pecking at them both in turn.
This way, look, prithee, towards me3, that vou may be able to see the crow.
(THEUROPIDES turns towards him.)
Now do you see it?
THEU. (looking about).
For my part, I really see no crow there.
1TRA.
But do you look in that direction, towards yourselves, since you cannot discover the crow, if perchance you may be able to espy the vultures.
(THEUROPIDES turns towards SIMO.)
Now do you see them?
THEU.
Upon my faith, I don't see them.
TRA.
But I can see two vultures.
THEU.
To make an end of it with you, I don't see any bird at all painted here.
TRA.
Well then, I give it up.
I excuse you;
it is through age you cannot see.
THEU.
These things which I can see, really they do all please me mightily.
SIM. (coming forward).
Now, at length, it's worth your while to move further on.
THEU.
Troth, you give good advice.
SIM. (calling at the door).
Ho there, boy !
take this person round this house and the apartments.
But I myself would have shown you round, if I hadn't had business at the Forum.
THEU.
Away with any one to show me over.
I don't want to be shown over.
Whatever it is, I'd rather go wrong than any one should show me over.
SIM.
The house I'm speaking of.
THEU.
Then I'll go in without any one to show me over.
SIM.
Go, by all means.
THEU.
I'll go in-doors, then.
TRA. (holding him back).
Stop, please;
let me see whether the.
dogTHEU.
Very well then, look.
(TRANIO looks into the passage.)TRA.
There is one.
THEU. (looking in).
Where is it?
TRA. (to the dog).
Be off and be hanged!
'St, won't you be off to utter perdition with you?
What, do you still linger ?
'St, away with you from here!
SIM. (coming nearer to the door).
There's no danger.
You only move on.
It's as gentle1 as a woman in childbed.
You may boldly step in-doors wherever you like.
I'm going hence to the ForumTHEU.
You've acted obligingly.
Good speed to you.
(Exit SIMO.)
Tranio, come, make that do- move away from the door inside, although it isn't to be feared.
TRA.
Nay but (pointing), you look at it, how gently it lies.
Unless you'd like yourself to appear troublesome and cowardly——THEU.
Very well, just as you like.
TRA.
Follow me this way then.
THEU.
For my part, I shall not move in any direction from your feet.
(They go into the house.)PHA. (to himself).
Servants who, though they are free from fault, still stand in awe of punishment, those same are wont to be serviceable to their masters.
But those who fear nothing, after they have merited punishment, hit upon foolish plans for themselves:
they exercise themselves in running;
they take to flight.
But, if they are caught, they acquire from punishment a hoard, which by good means they cannot.
They increase from a very little, and from that they lay by a treasure.
The resolution that's in my mind is to be deter­ mined to be on my guard against punishment, before my back comes to lose its state of soundness.
As hitherto it has been, so does it become my hide still to be, without a bruise, and such that I should decline its being beaten.
If I have any control over it, I shall keep it well covered up1.
When punishment is being showered down on others, don't let it be showered down on me.
But as servants wish their master to be, such is he wont to be.
He is good to the good, bad to the bad.
But now at our house at home there do live so many rogues, lavish of their property2, bearers of stripes.
When they are called to go fetch their master, " I shan't go;
don't be plaguing me;
I know where you are hurrying off to," is the reply. “
Now, faith, you mule, you're longing to go to pasturage out of doors3."
With better deserts, this advantage have I reaped from them, and, in consequence, I have come from home.
I alone, out of so many servants, am going to fetch my master.
When, to-morrow, my master comes to know this, in the morning he will chastise them with bull's-hide spoils.
In fine, I care less for their backs than for my own.
Much rather shall they be bull's-hide-scourged than I be rope-scourged1.
(Moves on.)SEE.
Hold you and stop this instant.
Phaniscus!
look round, I say!
PHA. (not turning round).
Don't be annoying to me.
SER.
Do see how'scornful the monkey is!
PHA.
I am so for myself;
I choose to be.
Why do you trouble yourself about it ?
( Walking on.)SEE.
Are you going to stop this instant, you dirty para­ site ?
PHA. (turning round).
How am I a parasite ?
SER.
Why, I'll tell you:
you can be drawn anywhere by victuals.
Do you give yourself airs, because your master's so fond of you ?
PHA.
(rubbing his eyes).
0 dear, my eyes do ache2.
SER.
Why so ?
PHA.
Because the smoke's so troublesome.
SER.
Hold your tongue, will you, you clever workman, who are in the habit of coining money out of lead3.
PHA.
You cannot compel me to be abusive to you.
My master knows me.
SEE.
Why, really, his own pillow4 he ought to know,for resting on when drunk.
PHA.
If you were sober, you wouldn't be abusive.
SER.
Am I to give heed to you, when you won't to mePHA.
But, you rascal, you come along with me to fetch him.
SER.
Troth now, Phauiscus, prithee, do leave off talking about these matters.
PHA.
I'll do so, and knock at the door.
(Knocks at the door ofthe house of THEUROPIDES.)
Hallo there!
is there any person here to protect this door from a most serious injury ?
(Knocking again.)
Is any one, is any one, I say, coming out here and going to open it P Why, really, no one comes out here.
Just as befits such worthless fellows, so they are.
But on that account, I've the more need to be cautious that no one may come out and use me ill.
( They stand aside.)TRA.
What's your opinion of this bargain ?
THEU.
I am quite delighted.
TRA.
Does it seem to you to have been bought too dear ?
THEU.
I' faith, I'm sure that I never anywhere saw a house thrown away, this one only excepted.
TRA.
Does it please you, then ITHEU.
Does it please me, do you ask me
Why yes, upon my faith, it really does please me very much.
TRA.
What a fine set of rooms for the women!
What a porch!
THEU.
Exceedingly fine.
For my part, I don't think that there is any porch larger than this in the public buildings.
TRA.
Why, I myself and Philolaches have taken the mea­ sure of all the porches in the public buildings.
TRA.
This is far larger than all of them.
THEU.
Immortal Gods-a splendid bargain!
On my word, if he were now to offer six great talents of silver, ready money, for it, I would never take it.
TRA.
Upon my faith, if you were inclined to take it, I would never let you.
THEU.
My money has been well invested upon this purchase.
TRA.
Boldly confess that by my advice and prompting it was done, who urged him to take up the money of the Banker upon interest, which we paid this person by way of deposit.
THEU.
You've saved the whole ship.
Eighty minæ1, you say, are owing for it ?
TRA.
Not a coin more.
THEU.
He may have it to-day.
TRA.
By all means so, that there may be no dispute arising;
or else pay them over to me, I'll then pay them over to him.
THEU.
But still, don't let there be any taking me in, if I do give them to you.
TRA.
Could I venture to deceive you in deed or word even in jest only ?
THEU.
Could I venture not to be oil my guard against you, so as not to trust anything, to you ?
TRA.
Why, have I ever imposed upon you in anything, since I was your servant ?
THEU.
But I've taken good care of that;
I owe thanks to myself and my own judgment for that.
If I'm only on my guard against you solely, I'm quite wise enough.
TRA. (aside).
I agree with you.
THEU.
Now be off into the country;
tell my son that I've arrived.
TRA.
I'll do as you wish.
THEU.
Run with all speed;
bid him come to the city at once together with you.
TRA.
Very well.
(Aside.)
Now I'll betake myself this way by the back-door to my boon-companions;
I'll tell them that things are quiet here, and how I have kept him away from here.
(Exit.PHA. (coming forward).
Really, I don't hear either the sound of revellers here, as once it was, nor yet the music-girl sinking, nor any one else.
(Goes towards the door.)THEU.
What's the matter here ?
What are these people seeking at my house ?
What do they want ?
What are they peeping in for ?
PHA.
I shall proceed to knock at the door.
(Knocks.)
Hallo there, unlock the door !
Hallo, Tranio!
are you going to open it, I say ?
THEU. (advancing).
What story's this, I wonder?
PHA. (aloud).
Are you going to open it, I say ?
I've come to fetch my master Callidamates.
THEU.
Harkye, you lads!
what are you doing there ?
Why are you breaking down that door ?
PHA.
Our master's at a drink ing-party here.
THEU.
Your master at a drinking-party here ?
PHA.
I say so.
THEU.
You're carrying the joke too far, my lad.
PHA.
We've come to fetch him.
THEU.
What person?
PHA.
Our master.
Prithee, how often must I tell you ?
THEU.
There's no one living here my lad;
for I do think that you are a decent lad.
PHA.
Doesn't a young gentleman called Philolaches live in this house ?SER. (aside).
This old fellow's crack-brained, surely.
PHA.
You are entirely mistaken, respected sir1;
for unless he moved from here to-day or yesterday, I know for certain that he's living here.
THEU.
Why, no one has been living here for these six months past.
SEE..
You are dreaming.
THEU.
What, I ?SEE.
You.
THEU.
Don't you be impertinent.
Let me speak to the lad.
(Pointing to PHANISCUS.)
PHA.
No one lives there?
0 dearTHEU.
It's the fact.
PHA.
Really!
why, yesterday and the day before, four, five, six days ago, all along, in fact, since his father went abroad from here, eating and drinking have never ceased for a single three days here.
THEU.
What is it you say ?
PHA.
That eating and drinking have never stopped for a single three days here, bringing in wenches, living like Greeks, hiring harpists and music-girls.
THEU.
Who was it did this ?
PHA.
the whose father I take to be Theuropides.
THEU. (apart).
0 dear, 0 dear!
I'm utterly undone, if he says the truth in this.
I'll continue to question him still
Do you say that this Philolaches, whoever he is, has been in the habit of drinking here together with your master ?
PHA.
Here, I tell you.
THEU.
My lad, contrary to your appearance, you are a fool.
See now, please, that you've not perchance been dropping in somewhere for an afternoon's whet1, and have been drinking there a little more than was enough.
PHA.
What do you mean?
THEU.
Just what I say:
don't be going by mistake to other persons' houses.
PHA.
I know where I ought to go;
and the place to which I was to come.
Philolaches lives here, whose father is Theuropides;
and who, after his father went away to trade, made free a music-girl here.
THEU.
Philolaches, say you?
PHA.
Just so;
Philema­ tium, I mean.
THEU.
For how much P SER.
For thirty talents.
PHA.
No, by Apollo9;
you mean minæ.
THEU.
Do you say that a mistress was purchased for Philolaches for thirty minæ ?
PHA.
I do say so.
THEU.
And that he gave her her freedom ?
PHA.
I do say so.
THEU.
And that after his father had departed hence abroad, he has been carousing here continually with your master PPHA.
I do say so.
THEU.
Well, has he made purchase of the house next door here ?
PHA.
I don't say so.
THEU.
Has he given forty minæ, too, to this person, to be as a deposit ?
PHA.
Nor yet do I say so.
THEU.
Ah me!
you've proved my ruin!
PHA.
Aye, and he has proved the ruin of his father.
THEU.
You prophesy the truth!
I could wish it false!
PHA.
A friend of his father, I suppose PTHEU.
Ah me!
Upon my faith, you do pronounce him to be a wretched father.
PHA.
Why really, this is nothing at all-thirty minæ, in comparison with the other expenses he has incurred in good living.
He has ruined his father.
There's one servant there, a very great scoundrel, Tranio by name;
he could even waste the revenue of a Hercules1.
On my word, I'm sadly distrest for his father;
for when he comes to know that things have gone on thus, a hot coal will be scorching his breast, poor man.
THEU.
If, indeed, this is the truth.
PHA.
What am I to gain, that I should tell a lie?
(Knocks again at the door.)
Hallo, you!
is any one coming to open this door ?
SER.
Why do you knock in this way, when there's no one in the house ?
PHA.
I fancy that he's gone elsewhere to carouse.
Now then, let's begone.
(They move as ifgoing.)THEU.
What, my lad, are you off then?
Liberty's the overcoat for your back2.
PHA.
Nothing have I with which to cover my back, except to pay respect and service to my master.
(-ExeUnt PHANISCUS and SERVANT.THEU. (to himself).
By my troth, I am undone!
What need is there of talking ?
According to the words I have heard, 1 surely haven't lately voyaged hence to AEgypt, but even to some desolate land and the most remote shores have I been borne about, so much am I at a loss to know where I now am.
But I shall soon know;
for see, here's the person of whom my son bought the house.
THEU.
What are you about ?
SIM.
I'm coming home from the Forum.
THEU.
Has anything new been going on at the Forum to-day?
SIM.
Why yes.
THEU.
What is it, pray ?
SIM.
I saw a dead man being carried to burial.
THEU.
Dear me !
that is something new!
SIM.
I saw one who was dead being carried out to burial1
They said that he had been alive but just before.
THEU.
Woe to that head of yours for your nonsense !
SIM.
Why are you, thus idling about, enquiring after the news ?
THEU.
Because I've just arrived from abroad.
SIM.
I'm engaged out to dine:
don't suppose I shall in­ vite you2.
THEU.
I' faith, I don't want.
SIM.
But, to-morrow, unless any person invites me first, I'll even dine with you.
THEU.
I' faith, and that, too, I don't want.
Unless you are engaged with something of greater importance, lend me your attention.
SIM.
By all means.
THEU.
You have received, as far as I understand, forty minæ of Philolaches.
SIM.
Never a coin, so far as I know.
THEU.
What?
Not from my servant Tranio ?
SIM.
Much less is that the case.
THEU.
Which he gave you by way of deposit ?
SIM.
What are you dreaming about ?
THEU.
What, I ?
Why, really, 'tis yourself, who hope that, by dissembling in this manner, you'll be able to make void this bargain.
SIM.
Why, what do you mean ?
THEU.
The business that, in my absence, my son transacted with you here.
SIM.
How did your son, in your absence, transact any business with me ?
What pray, or on what day ?
THEU.
I owe you eighty minæ of silver.
SIM.
Not to me, indeed, upon my faith;
but still, if you do owe them, give them me.
Faith must be kept.
Don't be attempting to deny it.
THEU.
Assuredly, I shall not deny that I owe them :
and I shall pay them.
Do you take care how you deny that you received the forty from him.
SIM.
Troth now, prithee, look this way at me, and answer me.
He said that you were wishful to give a wife to your son ;
for that reason, he said that you intended building on your own premises.
THEU.
J, intended building here ?
SIM.
So he told me.
THEU.
Ah me!
I'm ruined outright!
I've hardly any voice leftl.
Neighbours, I'm undone, ruined quite!
SIM
Has Tranio been causing any confusion ?
THEU.
Yes;
he has thrown everything into confusion.
He has made a fool of me to-day in a disgraceful manner.
SIM.
What is it you say ?
THEU.
This matter is just as I am telling you:
he has this day made a fool of me in an outrageous manner.
Now I beseech you that you'll kindly aid me, and lend me your assistance.
SIM.
What would you have ?
THEU.
I beg of you, come this way together with me.
SIM.
Be it so.
THEU.
Lend me the assistance of your slaves and some scourges.
SIM.
Take them by all means.
THEU.
At the same time I'll tell you about this, in what a fashion he has this day imposed upon me.
(They go into the house of SIMO.)TRA. (to himself).
The man that shall prove timid in cri­ tical matters, will not be worth a nutshell.
And, really, to say what that expression, " worth a nutshell," means, I don't know.
But after my master sent me into the country to fetch his son hither, I went that way (pointing) slily through the lane to our garden.
At the entrance to the garden that's in the lane, I opened the door;
and by that road I led out all the troop, both men and women.
After, from being in a state of siege, I had led out my troops to a place of safety, I adopted the plan of convoking a senate of my comrades, and when I had convoked it, they forthwith banished me from the senate.
When I myself perceived that the matter must be decided by my own judgment, as soon as ever I could, I did the same as many others do, whose affairs are in a critical or a perplexed state;
they proceed to render them more per­ plexed, so that nothing can be settled.
But I know full well, that now by no means can this be concealed from the old man.
But how's this, that our next neighbour's door makes a noise?
Why, surely this is my master:
I'd like to have a taste of his talk.
(Goes aside, out of sight of THEUROPIDES.)THEU. (in the doorway, speaking to SIMO'S SLAVES).
Do you stand there, in that spot within the threshold;
so that, the very instant I call, you may sally forth at once.
Quickly fasten the handcuffs upon him.
I'll wait before the house for this fellow that makes a fool of me, whose hide I'll make a fool of in fine style, if I live.
TRA. (apart).
The affair's all out.
Now it's best for you, Tranio, to consider what you are to do.
THEU. (to himself).
I must go to work to catch him cle­ verly and artfully when he comes here.
I'll not disclose to him my feelings all at once;
I'll throw out my line;
I'll con­ ceal the fact that I know anything of these matters.
TRA. (apart).
0 cunning mortal!
not another person in Athens can be pronounced more clever than he.
One can no more this day deceive him than he can a stone.
I'll accost the man;
I'll address him.
THEU. (to himself).
Now I do wish that he would come here.
TRA. (apart).
I' faith, if me indeed you want, here I am ready at hand for you.
(Comes forward.)
THEU.
Bravo!
Tranio, what's being done ?
TRA.
The country people are coming from the country Philolaches will be here in a moment.
THEU.
I' faith, he comes opportunely for me.
This neigh­ bour of ours I take to be a shameless and dishonest fellow.
THEU.
Inasmuch as he denies that he knows you.
TRA.
Denies it?
THEU.
And declares that you never gave him a single coin of moneyTRA.
Out with you, you are joking me, I do believe;
he doesn't deny it.
THEU.
How so?
TRA.
I am sure now that you are joking;
for surely he doesn't deny it.
THEU.
Nay but, upon my faith, he really does deny it;
or that he has sold this house to Philolaches.
TRA.
Well now, pray, has he denied that the money was paid him ?
THEU.
Nay more, he offered to take an oath to me, if I desired it, that he had neither sold this house, nor had any money him paid been.
I told him the same that you told me.
TRA.
What did he say P THEU.
He offered to give up all his servants for examination.
TRA.
Nonsense!
On my faith, he never will give them up.
THEU.
He really does offer them.
TRA.
Why then, do you summon him to trial.
THEU.
Wait a bit;
I'll make trial as I fancy.
I'm deter­ mined on it.
TRA.
Bring the fellow here to me.
THEU.
What then, if I go fetch some men ?
TRA.
It ought to have been done already;
or else bid the young man to demand possession of the house.
THEU.
Why no, I want to do this first—to put the ser­ vants under examinationl.
TRA.
I' faith, I think it ought to be done.
Meantime, I'll take possession of this altar9.
(Runs to the altar.)THEU.
Why so ?
TRA.
You can understand nothing.
Why, that those may not be able to take refuge here whom he shall give up for examination, I'll keep guard here for you;
so that the examination may not come to nothing.
THEU.
Get up from the altar.
TRA.
By no means.
THEU.
Prithee, don't you take possession of the altar.
THEU.
You shall hear;
why, because I especially want this, for them to be taking refuge there.
Do let them;
so much the more easily shall I get him fined before the judg?.
TRA.
What you intend to do, do it.
Why do you wish to sow further strife ?
You don't know how ticklish a thing it is to go to law.
THEU.
Just get up, (beckoning) this way;
it's, then, to ask your advice upon something that I want you.
TRA.
Still, as I am, I'll give my advice from this spot:
my wits are much sharper when I'm sitting1.
Besides, ad­ vice is given with higher sanction from holy places-.
THEU.
Get up;
don't be trifling.
Just look me in the face.
TRA.
(looking at him).
I am looking.
THEU.
Do you see me ?
TRA.
I do see-that if any third person were to step in here, he would die of hunger.
THEU.
Why so ?
TRA.
Because he would get no profit;
for, upon my faith, we are both artful ones.
THEU.
I'm undone!
TRA.
What's the matter with you?
THEU.
You have deceived me.
TRA.
How so, pray ?
THEU.
You've wiped me cleans.
TRA.
Consider, please, if it wasn't well done ;
is your nose running still ?
THEU.
Aye, all my brains besides have you been wiping out of my head as well.
For all your villanies I have dis­ covered from their very roots ;
and not from the roots, in­ deed, i' faith, but even from beneath the very roots.
Never this day, by my troth, will you have planned all this with­ out being punished.
I shall at once, you villain, order fire and faggots4 to be placed around you.
TRA.
Don't do it;
for it's my way to be sweeter boiled than roasted.
THEU.
Upon my faith, I'll make an example of you.
TRA.
Because I please you, you select me for an ex­ ample.
THEU.
Say now:
what kind of a person did I leave my son, when I went away from here PTRA.
One with feet and hands, with fingers, ears, eyes, and lips.
THEU.
I asked you something else than that.
TRA.
For that reason I now answer you something else.
But look, I see Callidamates, the friend of your son, coming this way.
Deal with me in his presence, if you want any­ thing.
CALL. (to himself).
When I had buried all drowsiness1, and slept off the debauch, Philolaches told me that his father had arrived here from abroad;
in what a way too his servant had imposed upon the man on his arrival;
he said that he was afraid to come into his presence.
Now of our company I am deputed sole ambassador, to obtain peace from his father.
And look, most opportunely here he is.
(Accosting THEUROPIDES.)
I wish you health, Theuropides, and am glad that you've got back safe from abroad.
You must dine here with us to-day.
Do so.
THEU.
Callidamates, may the Gods bless you.
For your dinner I offer you my thanks.
CALL.
Will you come then?
TRA.
(To THEUROPIDES.)
Do promise him;
I'll go for you, if you don't like.
THEU.
Whip-scoundrel, laughing at me still ?
TRA.
What, because I say that I'll go to dinner for you ?
THEU.
But you shan't go.
I'll have you carried to the cross, as you deserve.
TRA.
Come, let this pass, and say that I shall go to the dinner.
Why are you silent ?CALL. (to TRANIO).
But why, you greatest of simpletons, have you taken refuge at the altar ?
TRA.
He frightened me on his arrival.
( To THEUROPIDES.)
Say now, what I have done amiss.
Look, now there's an .umpire for us both;
come, discuss the matter.
THEU.
I say that you have corrupted my son.
TRA.
Only listen.
I confess that he has done amiss;
that he has given freedom to his mistress ;
that in your absence he has borrowed money at interest;
that, I admit, is squan­ dered away.
Has he done anything different to what sons of the noblest families do ?
THEU.
Upon my faith, I must be on my guard with you;
you are too clever a pleader.
CALL.
Just let me be umpire in this matter.
( To TRANIO.)
Get up;
I'll seat myself there.
THEU.
By all means:
take the management of this dispute to yourself.
(Pushes him to one side of the altar.)TRA.
Why, this is surely a trick.
Make me, then, not to be in a fright, and yourself to be in a fright in my stead.
THEU.
I consider now everything of trifling consequence, compared with the way in which he has fooled me.
TRA.
I' faith, 'twas cleverly done, and I rejoice that it was done.
Those who have white heads ought at that age to be wiser.
THEU.
What am I now to do if my friend Demipho or PhilonidesTRA.
Tell them in what way your servant made a fool of you.
You would be affording most capital plots for Comedies.
CALL.
Hold your tongue awhile;
let me speak in my turn.
—Listen.
THEU.
By all means.
CALL.
In the first place of all then, you know that I am the companion of your son;
he has gone to my house, for he is ashamed to come into your presence, because he knows that you are aware what he has done.
Now, I beseech you, do pardon his simplicity and youthfulness.
He is your son;
yoa know that this age is wont to play such pranks;
whatever he has done, he has done in company with me.
We have acted wrong:
the interest, principal, and all the sum at which the mistress was purchased, all of it we will find, and will contribute together, at our own cost, not yours.
THEU.
No mediator could have come to me more able to influence me than yourself.
I am neither angry with him1, nor do I blame him for anything:
nay more, in my presence, wench on, drink, do what you please.
If he's ashamed of this, that he has been extravagant, I have sufficient satisfaction.
CALL.
l'in quite ashamed myself.
TRA.
He grants pardon thus far;
now then, what is tc become of me ?
THEU.
Filth, tied up as you hang, you shall be beaten with stripes.
TRA.
Even though I am ashamed1 ?
THEU.
Upon my faith, I'll be the death of you, if I live!
CALL.
Make this pardon general;
do, pray, forgive Tranio this offence, for my sake.
THEU.
I would more readily put up with your obtaining any other request of me than that I should forbear sending to perdition this fellow for his most villanous doings.
CALL.
Pray, do pardon him.
TRA.
Do pardon me ?
THEU.
Look there, don't you see how the villain sticks there?
(Pointing to the altar.)CALL.
Tranio, do be quiet, if you are in your senses.
THEU.
Only do you be quiet in urging this matter.
I'll subdue him with stripes, so that he shall be quiet.
CAJL.
Really, there is no need.
Come now, do allow yourself to be prevailed upon.
THEU.
I wish you would not request me.
CALL.
Troth now, I do entreat you.
THEU.
I wish you would not request me, I tell you.
CALL.
It's in vain you wish me not;
only do grant this one pardon for his offence, pray, for my sake, I do entreat you.
TRA.
Why make this difficulty?
As if to-morrow I shouldn't be very soon committing some other fault;
then, both of them, both this one and that, you'll be able tc punish soundly.
CALL.
Do let me prevail upon you.
THEU.
Well then, have it so;
begone, unpunished!
(TRA­ NIO jumps down from the altar.)
There now, (pointing to CAL­ LIDAMATES) return him thanks for it.

Spectators, this Play is finished;

Neither night nor day was I ever at rest;
now I'll go to sleep.
Really, I have neither taken nor touched with any plea­ sure.
A tipsy man is wont to be cured by sleep.
Those who set raw herbs before me, and give pickled fish,I dug ten ditches in a day.
Surely this headstrong fellow has appointed a guard.
Quoted by Aulus Gellius :
How I did gull the fellow.
Quoted by Porphyrins, a Commentator on Horace :
Myrtle [masculine], myrtle [feminine]l.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
The cap that he had, he took off, and raised it towards the heavens.

he'll now be setting my loins at the value of a straw.

Quoted by Cledonius:
I'm quite tired.
Quoted by Fulgentius.
In such a way do you keep us and our household in a worry.

An ill-omened bird came in the evening.
Quoted by Servius, in his Commentary on the Æneid:
Unless, perchance, at some time you break out of prison, your house.

A little man, made of potter's clay and of mud.
Quoted by Diomedes :
Carry away the pots.
Quoted by Charisius:
Is not this at the public charge ?
Quoted by Priscian :
I've lost my goods, and I've found ills:
from yourselves I have become estranged.
Whom, by stratagem, I have beggared after wealth so great.
Like a wolf am I strong in the shoulders;
my loins I have unhurt.
I'd much rather do my work than go to sleep.
I dread a lethargy.
Now I'm at liberty to say whatever I please;
there's no one left behind.
An unguent, which would have made bilge-water in the nostrils of the muleteers.
Quoted by Varro :
Follow, follow, Polybadiscus;
I wish to gain my expec­ tations.
POLYB.
I' faith, I certainly do follow;
for with pleasure do I follow what I hope for.
Factious women make provisions dear instead of cheap for the men.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus:
You really bore me through with an auger.
To betake himself to his heels forthwith from this neigh­ bourhood.
Quoted by Festus:
Let it be well bored;
and add dovetail cramps.

Winnowings of corn.
Quoted by Varro and Festus:
Not like her are the wan snails3 here, twopenny4 haunters of the theatres, singular creatures.

Quoted by Festus and Priscian:
With ankles worn out, with saffron-coloured legs.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
With hair cut short, and close-cropped ears.
A way with your evils ;
I stand in need of good.
Quoted by Festus:
Like the drawing-beam of a well, or the Grecian javelin1, you go to and fro on even ground.
But why don't you go, if you are going ?
You are too slow in your pace.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
I' faith, mother, I've been more trained by you for lying down than for running;
for that reason I'm somewhat slow.
Quoted by Fulgentius, on the Purity of Virgil:
What ?
Are you afraid of your mistress, lest she should strike you with her sleeve ?
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
She keeps me at a distance from her very great riches, her fair and ample portion.
I' troth, I'll clear myself of all, even to croaking hoarseness.
You, who, as it were, are cleaning out the alleys of the butcher.
I'll go in-doors;
for really it's the part of a prostitute, for a Courtesan to be standing in the street alone.
They have been mindful of their duty.
Quoted by Aulus Gellius:
Can you not, fellow, do a bold deed ?
There are plenty of others who can do it;
really I do not care for myself to be considered a daring man.
Quoted by Priscian:
What, are you then my dear little mother PMy own dear sister born.
If, indeed, you request according to my means, according to my limited circumstances.
You, old gentlemen, are wont to be the finders of very pleasant jobs for us.
I could neigh after this little mare, if she were left by her­ self with me alone.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
For such a smell of new wine has reached my nostrils.
Quoted by Priscian :
Do you require me to answer ?
'Tis unfair.
It always becomes me voluntarily to make my terms with the men;
that's the calling I follow.
Promising is good for nothing.
Quoted by Macrobius:
What mortal is there that ever was blessed with such good fortune as I now am, for whose stomach this procession is moving along ?
Even this sturgeon2, which has hitherto lain hidden from me in the sea, whose side with my teeth I shall just now stow away into my own sides.
Quoted by Aulus Gellius:
May the Gods confound that man who first disclosed the hours, and who first, in fact, erected a sun-dial here;
who, for wretched me, minced the day up into pieces.
For when I was a boy, this stomach was the sun-dial, one much better and truer than all of these;
when that used to warn me to eat, except when there was nothing to eat.
Now, even when there is something to eat, it's not eaten, unless the sun chooses ;
and to such a degree now, in fact, is the city filled with sun-dials, that the greater part of the people are creeping along the streets shrunk up with famine.
Quoted by Macrobius:
He said that a thin-shelled nut-tree1 was hanging over his tiles.
From the “Carbonaria,” or “Charcoal Manufactory."Quoted by Priscian:
Close by the altar itself I concealed the gold.
Quoted by Festus:
I want gammon of bacon, sow's udders, the belly-piece the brawn, the kernels of the throat.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus:
Bearing my gibbet I shall be carried through the city afterwards I shall be nailed to the cross.
Quoted by Sospiter Charisius :
Not anything at all was done except with art, nor was any thing placed there without luxuriousness, gold, ivory, silver, pictures, purple, spoils, and statues.
And never shall you get her away from me against my will.
To view the games with magnificence and pomp.
He is abroad3.
I wish his farm was worth as much again as it is worth.
Such are the robbers ;
they spare no one whatever.
I wish you to be a witness that it is carefully done.
The enemies are withdrawn ;
the stones are removed.
If he does not readily confess where the gold is, we wil cut off his limbs with a saw.
I have not done otherwise than I ought.
A
Who are you who that are leading me ?A. I' troth, I am undone !
it is the African.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
He had a golden goblet of eight pounds' weight;
the other would not accept it.
Found by Angelo Mai among the Fragments of Plautus :
Those who, giving their word, by breaking it, have deceived him who trusted them;
crafty flatterers who are near the King, who in their speeches say one thing to the King, but mean quite otherwise in their minds.
Quoted by Priscian;
Headlong I'll jump into the pit.
Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ:
Shall I bear this thus early in the morning, like one out of his senses ?
Light the torches.
Festus says, under the word " Pro," Plautus uses " Pro!" in the " Condalium," as an exclamation of surprise.
Quoted by Diomedes the Grammarian :
Let the house be scented like Arabia.
Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ:
He who for ten years has served the King Demetrius.

See, here's out Circus2.

I am a virgin;
not yet have I learned to repeat the words used at weddings4.
Quoted by Festus :
Hark you!
What, in a foreign land, a freed-woman is reported to have said to her patroness, that same do I say to you:
“Freed-woman, hail to you !
Take that thump, Papyria5.
Quoted by Diomedes the Grammarian :
Which I shall ransack thoroughly.
Quoted by Aulus Gellius :
Now this is just the ram's answer2 which is given at the preat games:
I shall perish if I don't do it3;
if I do, I shall get a beating.
Quoted by Sospater Charisius :
Let us discourse leisurely.
Quoted by Priscian and Festus :
He was to me the bile, the dropsy, the cough, the chilly fevers.
Quoted by Festus and Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ :
A.
Follow me this way, will you, all you legions of Laverna.
Light armed soldiers, where are you ?B. See, here they are.
A. Where are the supernumeraries6?D. See, here we are.
A. Come, then, fall back, all of you, as the veterans7 are wont to do.

And I shall get the better of all the female hired mourners1 in screaming.

Then first her breasts, like two twin-brothers, were begin­ ning to swell;
this I meant to say, like two twin-sisters.
What need is there of talking ?
Quoted by Priscian :
0 friend Cephalic!
out of many my only one.
Quoted by Festus :
Take the haunch of lamb2.
Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ:
A. Well, well, see the weals, what great ones they are!B. Now I've looked.
What's the matter ?

Meat from off the haunches, it is veal;
you shall have a dinner.
Quoted by Festus:
Let the crier4 be there with a wreath;
and for what he' - fetch, let him be sold.
Quoted by Fulgentius :
I had rather that he was fastened to the fishing-boat, that he might be always fishing, even though there were a very great tempest.
Quoted by Festus and Priscian :
This boy is grieved that he is put up for sale.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
I looked in a mirror ;
I observed my cloak.
Cheese for a Parasite may be scraped with sticks.

At home I left a virgin past her prime.
Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ :
With a file I forthwith sharpened the rasp.
Quoted by Festus :
They hinder me from doing my business in another quarter.
Very speedily may we be made free.
It becomes a gallant to be profusely prodigal.
Wine very weak;
because it makes them infirm either in body or in mind.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
Both of them are in love to madness.
Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latind :
From thence, well drenched, at early dawn I began to pro­ ceed straight homeward on my way.
Quoted by Festus:
Both decked out with great praises;
in fine, we are both not worth a nutshell.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
Add mussels, sea-urchins, and oysters3.
Quoted by Priscian :
I don't want a drone in my hive, to eat up the food of the bees.
Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ :
The honor of the minced meat, the gammons, and the kernels of pig's throat is gone.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
For he has a red forehead;
he's slender and thins.
Festus says, " Plautus in his Saturio mentions that the Romans used to eat, that is fed upon, the flesh of puppies.
"
Pliny the Elder, in his 29th Book, doubtless alludes to this Play, when he says, " The Comedies of Plautus give proof that puppies' flesh was used at the public feasts.
"Quoted from Festus:
She cannot be drawn back, whichever way she has once proceeded.
A. I see it has fared ill with you.B.
Why, he was as smooth as a kidney.
Get a reinforcement of a hundred people, to amuse you at home.
From the " Scytha Liturgus5," " The Scythian Body-Guard.
"Quoted by Varro, De Linguâ Latinâ:
You are a woman, dear wife!
be off;
I understand you ;
I know you are a caviller.
Quoted by Festus :
So she might afterwards produce me deformed children ;
either a bandy-legged, or a knock-kneed, or a bow-legged, or a squint-eyed, or a tusk-toothed son1.
Quoted by Aulus Gellius:
Had I not run away, he would have bitten me through the middle, I do believe.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
Wherever he saw each stalk, he plundered all.
Quoted by Prisciun :
A slave, I know not who, leaped out of the myrtle grove.
This is a poor affair.
Tell me, if you please, who the woman is, whom you desire to make your wife.
A mussel is placed before it;
but I'll tell what the mark is.
Attend to me, both of you, please.
Put down the wallet here.
I will keep it as though you had given it as a deposit.
I shall return it to neither.
Until this matter is decided.
I don't object to the deposit.
Penury, mourning, sorrow, poverty, cold, hunger.
Bacchanals of that description have made a Pentheus3 of our ship.
Now, as we've left the wallet as a deposit.
Now will the servant coax my father out of the money.
Aye this, that this is my country, and that this man is my father;
but that person is the father of the Soterini.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus:
I had rather that those who belong to me should d.e, than be beggars:
good men pity the one;
bad men laugh at the other.
The impression seemed right;
his ring I compared with it.
Why many words ?
We have contended enough.
Quoted by Fulgentius Planciades, and (according to Mar­ cellus) by another Grammarian, whose name is unknown :
Order him to be sewed up in a sack1, and to be thrown into the deep, if you wish for provisions to be cheap.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus:
As I was fishing there, with my three-pronged fork I struck the wallet.
Quoted by Junius Philargyrius, in his Commentary on the Eclogues of Virgil:
For I've heard say that a woman once brought forth a lion.
Quoted by Varro, De Lingua Latinâ:
In the fish-pond, where there are various things.
A smoke-making Epeus2, who has victuals cooked for our troops.
The odious fellow has been dinning the ears of all the household.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus:
For your father never had even any intercourse with her.
Quoted by Festus :
You may be off post haste.
Now, for your deserts, is your hide made so thick.
May the Gods prosper it!
Take the purse;
in it there will be thirty minæ.
I do believe that, among men, there is nothing more swift than fame.
He is a fool, considering his age and the white hue of his head.
Are my eyes dim ?
Is not this our Hermio ?
He has forsworn warfare.
You slip in upon me daily, just like a beaver among the willows.
When Plautus says, “ Herbani do" [I give you grass], he means, "I own myself subdued."
This is a characteristic of the ancient and pastoral life;
for those who in the fields were contending in races or trials of strength, when they were subdued, plucked some grass from that spot on which the contest took place, and presented it to the adversary.
Quoted by Festus :
Has a fever ever seized upon you ?
I value not a rush your Muneral1 or your Lenonian Law, whether it had been proposed or not.
Caught in your treachery.
I' faith, you're fitting your neck with the chain.
But I see pickled fish in vessels like fish-ponds, good oysters, lobsters, and crabs2, plump sea-urchins, shells for the fish-ponds.
Don't I know you, you seaman's scribes, you impudent slave's collar ?
You would not disoblige him, if you are at all wise in the eyes of the Persians.
Whether you hold it sacred or profane, it matters little.
Full of sores, loaded with fetters, branded with irons, filthy.
Quoted by Nonius Marcellus :
Swarms of dormice.
But the Procurer's coming out of doors.
Here in a secret place I'll pick up his conversation.
Why do you mutter to yourself, and torment yourself?
Nor yet, sword, dare you to grind your teeth at me ?
Quoted by Fulgentius :
I care a straw for what you do.
Quoted by Donatus, in his Commentary on the Phormio of Terence:
Make money of it.
Quoted by Junius Philargyrius, in his Commentary on the Georgies of Virgil:
They hasten to prepare the breakfast.
Quoted by Pontanus, in his Commentary on Mfacrobius:
He does not eat to gather strength, but he desires to gather strength that he may eat.
Quoted by Donatus, in his Commentary on the Hecyra of Terence :
Perhaps suspect that they are in love.
Paulus Diaconus, quoting from Festus, mentions “ Thocus," as used by Plautus to signify a kind of seat.
Quoted by Festus :
Surely you have ever held me as of the greatest conse­ quence in your affairs.
Quoted by Diomedes the Grammarian :
What, am I to be sold to him ?
Quoted by Charisius:
Be inside there, until I come back again.
Charisius says:
" ‘ Butu batta.'
These words Plautus has used as signifying a ‘ mere nothing,' and a ' trifling matter,' as in the glossaries of the ancients, ‘ battati' is a certain quivering and effeminate sound of the voice.
"Quoted by Servius, in his Commentary on the Æneid B. 1, 1. 178:
I'll write on your body with elm-tree rods.
I never come to the city;
except when the Garment of Minerva1 is borne in procession.
To defile the hands.
The bird itself brings about its own death.
I'll lead you about as one possessed.
This woman is poor.
Quoted by an ancient Commentator on Horace, Sat. B. 2 s. 5,1.11:
Cilix, Lyciscus, Sosia, Stichus, Parmeno, come out, and bring each a stick in his hand.
Quoted by Porphyrins, in his Commentary on the Odes of Horace :
This weak old woman portends danger.
Quoted by Phocas the Grammarian:
To my father surely.
Quoted by Diomedes the Grammarian:
There is one:
she has cut the head off.
Quoted by Macrobius:
With me dwell disease, maladies1, and debt.

Aulus Gellius:
How is this ?
My cloak is creased-I am not properly drest.
Come you forth, Davus;
come, sprinkle some water.
I want this vestibule to be clean.
My Venus is about to come;
it should not be dusty.
Quoted by Festus:
You have no Syrus.
I hardly can survive the griefs which, ah wretched me!
wax stronger day by day.
Quoted by Priscian :
Who is such a one of the number of his daughters.
Priscian says that in the writings cf Plautus, the word " pullaria," means " the right hand.
"Festus says that Plautus uses " vesperna" to signify " cœna," or " the afternoon's meal.
"Quoted in a fragment of Festus:
A.
A sow's stomach * * (I'll call it by its own name" scrutillus.")
* * *B. I myself to-day * * if I had eaten any thing- should perhaps have drunk.
Quoted by M. Valerius Probus the Grammarian:
This is my stall.
He also says that one word with the termination “ dur," is found in Plautus, " magadur.
"Quoted by Fulgentius :
Bring out the casket with the trinkets.
Quoted by Pontanus, on the Commentary “ In SomniumHe exposes his scars, and tells of his dangers.
While the little birds begin their song in spring.
To repel religious scruples from himself.* * But still don't you quite put your fists in my power * * * .
Neither is it just for Gods or men to do so, though I may be hereafter.
She who was placed under my charge, and entrusted to my honor, who was to pass her life with me, with me in marriage * * Let her enter into the compact;
take her I must, and not put her aside.
* * * *
But what do you advise me now ?
* * * *
Where are the things I commanded?
Surely * * * 'tis not enough, I think, to have ad­ vised the guilty.
In acting this way, whether are you mad, prithee, or are you dreaming in your love ?
* * * *
Who do not wish me to bring * * a coat of mail;
after that, many with lances, many light- armed skirmishers, many of them, with many others.
These things you * * did say to me.
Prithee, did I not say the same ?
Just now, indeed, i' faith, you did say so, not indeed in my presence.
You are a juggler, since, indeed, you are not here, and are out of your senses.
I see that you are greatly suffering from the poison of love, young man1;
for that reason do I wish you the more to be advised.
Advise me.
Take you care, will you, never to go to war with love.
What shall I do ?
Go to the house2 of her mother;
clear yourself, protest on oath, blandly supplicate her with prayers, and entreat her not to be angry with you.
I' faith, I'll clear myself of all, even to croaking hoarseness3.
* * * Troth, if so it were, indeed, that my clever little woman were decked out, although I am an old geld­ ing, at me, even now, I fancy she would neigh4.
I could do the same for this little mare, if she alone were left with me by herself5.
It happens very opportunely for me, that Alcesi­ marchus has returned.
For no one, when alone, is wont to be very unwilling.
* * Don't be alone * *
But when I put a construction on her speeches, on my faith, 'tis she, as I guess, who has corrupted my son.
* * What if I accost her, and accuse her of -evil and mischief ?
Allurements or * *In the " Miles GloriosusBetween lines 185 and 186, read:
“ So that she really does not fall short at all of a woman's astuteness6.
"A few mutilated lines of the " Vidularia" were found by Mai, which are incapable, from their disjointed nature, of any connected translation;
with the exception of the fol­ lowing line:
I'll stand here, and watch if any one accosts my friend.
Of the “ Kakistus," some fragments were discovered by Mai;
a few lines of which only admit of any translation:
Oil my word, you have this day related to me your woes, many in number, and on that account * * espe­ cially, and more openly, * * * because I had compassion on you.
There is that young mail whom all * * * * * Pay me no interest * * * * For I ask for one to lend on interest.
