I. IN what manner Callirrhoe, the love­ lieft of women, was joined in wed­ lock, under the aufpices of Venus, to Chæreas the most handsome among men:
and how, being thought dead on occasion of a violent blow given her by Chæreas, in a fit fit of jealoufy, she was magnificently inter­ red :
How afterwards recovering, pyrates drew her, in the dead of night, out of the sepulchre;
and crossing the fea, fold her in Ionia to Dionyfius :
His paffion for Callir­ rhoe;
her fidelity to Chasreas ;
and the necef­ fity the was under, on account of her preg­ nancy, to marry again :
Theron's confeffion ;
with Chæreas's voyage, in order to feek his wife :
His captivity with Polycharmus;
and their being fold in Caria :
How Mithri­ dates knew Chæreas again, just as he was going to suffer ;
and the strong endeavours used by the former, to- unite the fevered to­ vers:
In what manner Dionysius, having dif­ covered thefe particulars, by means of let­ ters, accufed Mithridates to Pharnaces ;
and how the latter informed against Mithridates to the king.
Lastly, how the monarch sum­ moned both the parties to take their trial-
All All thefe incidents have been related ;
and we now proceed to the fequel of the story.—
Callirrhoe was not difpleafed with her voyage till her arrival in Cilicia, as she had hitherto heard the Greek language fpoke;
and could fee that part of the ocean which flows to­ wards Syracpfe :
but when the came to the Euphrates, on the other fide whereof is a continent subject to the king of Perfia, stretch­ ing out a vaft length ;
she then began to sigh for her native country, and her relations ;
and despaired of ever returning again to them.
Hereupon, Handing on the banks of the river, the ordered all her attendants to retire, her faithful Plangon excepted, and then poured forth thefe words;
O envious Fortune !
too obstinately bent to persecute a haplefs, forlorn woman.
Thou didst shut me up in a sepulchre;
and deliver me thence, not out of pity, but to put me into the hands of of pyrates.
Theron, and the ocean, divid­ ed my flight between them.
I, though the daughter of Hermocrates, was fold;
and what is still more grievous to me than bon­ dage, have been beloved ;
and, in Chæreas's life-time, married to another man.
Yet thou now envieft me even thefe nuptials.
Thou doft not banish me to Ionia.
I there, indeed, was in a foreign land;
but then its inhabitants were Greeks;
and I had the fond consolation to dwell in the neigh­ bourhood of the sea.
Thou doll- now force me from the accustomed air which I firft breathed;
and a whole world lies between me and my native country.
Thou doft drive me from Miletus, as before from Syracuse.
I, born an islander, am dragged over the Euphrates;
and fhut up in the interior parts of a barbarous country ;
which no fea wa(hes.
What hopes have I, that a Sicilian ship will ever ever fail this way ?
0 my Chæreas !
I am even fevered from thy sepulchre.
Excellent Manes!
Who will henceforward offer up fa­ crifices to thee?
Bactra and Sufa will, for ever after, be my habitation and my grave.
O Euphrates!
never shall I crofs thy flood again.
I do not fo much dread the length of the journey, as the misfortune of my ap­ pearing, there, beautiful in the eyes of tome one.——
Having faid thefe words, the kissed the earth ;
and then going on board, crossed the river.
Dionyfius had a grand retinue, and fplendor shone in every part of it;
he being refolved to exhibit, to his wife, the utmoft magnificence on this occafion ;
which alfo might make him more acceptable to the king.
He met with universal courtesy in his progrefs;
the people of one province conducting him to the next;
and each go­ vernor recommending him to the neighbour- ing.
ing one:
for Callirrhoe's beauty fascinated and enflaved every beholder.
Thofe Barba­ rians were likewise in hopes, that this wo­ man would one day be very powerful.
Hence all were extremely defirous of entertaining them in their houfes;
and, by laying her under obligations, they expected a return of favour.
Thus were matters circumstanced at this juncture.
II.
But Mithridates was more expeditious in his progrefs, which was through Armenia;
he being apprehensive that, should he go the fame road with Callirrhoe, and immediately after her, this would be represented, to the king, as an argument of his guilt.
He alfo was very desirous of arriving first, in order that he might have time to prepare every thing necessary for, and of advantage to, his trial.
Being come to Babylon, where the king king then resided ;
Mithridates ftaid at home all that day, and devoted it wholly to rest ;
each governor having his particular quarter aligned him.
On the morrow he went to court, where he firft vifited thofe of his own rank, who are called Homotimi.
After hav­ ing faluted the eunuch Artaxates, and pre­ rented gifts to him;
he being in a moft ex­ alted station, and very powerful with the king ;
—O Artaxates!
(faid he) fpeak thus to my liege.
Mithridates, thy Servant, is come hither, in order to clear himfelf from the accufation brought againft him by the Greek;
and to fall profirate before his fovereign.——
Artaxates coming out a little after, brought the following answer :
That the king ad­ vifed Mithridates not.
to prevaricate;
and, with regard to the trial, that it would be entered upon fo foon as Dionyfius should ar­ rive.
—Mithridates then paid his adoration, and and went away.
Being returned to his lodg­ ings, and alone, he fent for Chæreas, and spake thus :
—I am persecuted, and charged with a defign to reftore Callirrhoe to thee:
for Dionyfius declares, that the letter which thou didft write to thy wife, was drawn up by me ;
and imagines, that he has got evi­ dent proofs of an adulterous commerce.
He is firmly persuaded, that thou art dead;
and let him continue in that belief, till the day of the trial;
that thou mayeft then appear on a fudden, and unexpectedly.
One re­ queft I have to make, in return for my great kindness to thee, viz.
that thou wouldeft have so much patience as to lie concealed;
and to forbear feeing Callirrhoe, or even making the leaft enquiry concerning her.
Chæreas obeyed, though with the utmoft reluctance ;
and fpite of his violent struggle, to conceal the fecrets of his foul, yet tears gushed gushed infenfibly from his eyes;
whereupon he thus replied:
——My Lord!
Thy com­ mands shall be obeyed..
Then retiring to the apartment where he, and his friend Poly­ charmus, lodged;
Chæreas threw himself on the floor, and tore his garments;
after which,Then weeping, said :
O my Callirrhoe !
We are near ;
and yet muft not fee each other.
But this is no ways thy fault, as thou knowest not that Chæreas is still alive.
But I am the moft wicked of men, who, . being bid not to fee thee;
am yet fo much a coward, and fo fond of life, as tamely to Submit to a tyrannical order:
whereas, had had fuch an injunction been laid on thee, thou wouldeft have died.
—Polycharmus employed the most toothing wolds, in hopes of con­ doling him ;
about which time Dionyfius was advanced pretty near to Babylon.
Fame had previoufly filled the city with the news of the approach of the woman, whose beauty was not human, but rather of the celestial kind ;
and fuch as Sol did not behold in his mighty progress.
As the Barbarians are, by nature, distractedly fond of females, every houfe, and every ftreet echoed with this re­ port ;
which reaching the king's ear, he asked the eunuch Artaxates, whether the Mi­ lesian woman was come.
Dionysius had long felt great uneasinefs, on account of his wife's being fo universally talked of ;
a circumstance that prevented his enjoying, with Security, the happinefs he really possest ;
but when he reflected that he was going to Babylon, he he was not merely grieved, but all on fire;
whereupon, venting a deep figh, he groaned thus within himself :
Thou art not now (0 Dionyfius !) in Miletus, thine own coun­ try.
Even there thou wert afraid of se- ducers.
How then couldest thou be fo rati, fo thoughtless of futurity, as thy felf to take Callirrhoe to Babylon, where are so many Mithridates's ?
In Sparta, that city so renowned for the chastity of its morals, Me­ nelaus could not keep Helen wholly to him­ self ;
but found a rival in a barbarous shep­ herd.
Many a Paris is met with in Persia.
Perceived thou not the dangers ?
Seest thou not the prelude to thefe things ?
Entire cities come forth to meet us, and governors lavish their favours upon us.
This has already fwelled Callirrhoe's pride, though the king has not yet seen her.
The only way then left for thee to keep thy wife, will be to conceal her.
her.
If (he can but be hid, I shall Secure her to my felf.
Having thus reasoned in his own mind, he mounted on horfeback, and left Callirrhoe alone in the chariot, after drawing the curtains round her.
And had it not been for an incident which happened, his defires would very probably have been accomplished.
III.
The wives of the greater Persian Lords went to Statira, the king's contort when one of them thus addressed her:
Royal lady I a contemptible, female Grecian, our enemy, who has long been the subject of univerfal admiration, is coming hither.
We are in danger (and that through our own fault,) of lofing, in this age, the glory which fo highly distinguishes the Persian fair.
Let us rouze then, and consider how we may pre­ vent our beauty, and the reputation of it, from from being obfcured by this female fo­ reigner.
—The queen fmiled at thefe words;
she giving little credit to the report, and fpake thus :
The Greeks are vain, and pay no regard to truth ;
they making the moft trifling things the subject of admiration;
whence they loudly pronounce Callirrhoe lovely, and Dionyfius rich.
When therefore she fhall be arrived in the city, let one of us come forth, and eclipfe at once the imaginary charms of that mean, Insignificant slave.—
All the ladies paid adoration to the queen;
and admiring her wifdom, they cried aloud, as with one voice:
Would (0 queen!) that thou mighteft be feen in public.
They afterwards differed very much in opi­ nion ;
on which occasion many women, re- Downed for their exquifite charms, being named;
they proceeded to the election, as in a theatre ;
when Rhodogune, daughter to to Zopyrus, and wife to Megabyzus, was chosen ;
she being a model of perfect beauty, and as renowned all over Alia, as Callirrhoe was throughout Ionia.
Hereupon the ladies led forth the chofen fair, and began to deck her ;
each contributing fome trinket, or other ornament, for that purpose.
The queen alfo presented her with bracelets and collars.
Being thus fplendidly arrayed, and prepared for the congress ;
she fet out, in high Spirits, to meet Callirrhoe;
which she likewise was induced to do from a family motive;
Rhodo­ gune being sister to Pharnaces, he who had writ to the king concerning Dionyfius.
All Babylon came forth to this fpeaacle;
inso­ much that the crouds stopt the passages at the several gates.
Rhodogune being conducted out of the palace, and attended by a princely train, stopt on an eminence very vifible on every side ;
when, assuming the moft affected airs, airs, she deemed to challenge the approaching stranger.
Instantly she attracted all eyes, when one said to another :
We are con­ querors !
The Persian lady will eclipfe the foreign woman.
Let her vie with Rhodogune if she can:
Let the Greeks now learn, that they are a compound of pride and vanity.-
While they were thus talking, Dionyfius ar­ rived ;
when being informed that the sister of Pharnaces was present, he alighted im­ mediately from his horfe ;
and went up to her, to pay his respects.
Rhodogune, half blufhing, faid:
I muft falute my sister ;
and thereupon flew to the chariot.
It was now impossible to conceal Callirrhoe any longer behind the curtains;
so, that Dionysius was forced, though with infinite reluctance ;
with fighs;
and through fhame, to defire his wife to alight.
instantly the multitude not only directed their glances, but fixed their their very fouls, on Callirrhoe;
infomuch that they almost fell over one another;
every one longing to fee her firft ;
and to get as near her as possible.
Her face then shone ;
and its lightning dazzled the eyes of every beholder;
like as when a ftrong effulgence bursts fud­ denly from amid the gloom of night.
The Barbarians, now feized with astonishment, worshipped her;
and no one thought that Rhodogune was present;
who finding her felf vanquished ;
being unable to go forward, and yet unwilling to flay behind, fhe stole into the chariot to Callirrhoe ;
and thus Sub­ mitted to be carried off by her conqueror.
The chariot (whofe curtains were still drawn) went forward:
and the people, being now deprived of the fight of Callirrhoe, blew kisses after her.
The king hearing of Dio­ nyfius's arrival, commanded Artaxates the eunuch to make the following declaration to him :
him :
—
As thou haft brought a charge, againft a man whom I entrusted with the go­ vernment of a large province;
thou shouldest not have been to flow in thy journey.
How­ ever, I pardon thy fault, as thou didst travel with thy wife.
I now celebrate a festival, and am chiefly employed in Sacrifices.
Thirty days hence I will hear thy fuit.
Dionysius paid his adoration, and withdrew.
IV.
Preparations for the trial began pre. fently to be made, on both fides, as for a mighty war.
The Barbarians, in general, were divided into two parties.
All the go­ vernors, and thofe who had any dependanoc on them, were for Mithridates;
he being originally a Bactrian ;
and lately come into Caria.
Dionyfius had the favour of the common people;
as fnares had been laid for him, on occasion of his wife;
and fuch a wife.
wife as Callirrhoe:
and especially as great injury seemed to have been done him, con­ trary to the laws.
Neither were the Persian women eafy on this occasion, they alb being divided in opinion.
Such of them as were proud of their own charms, envied Callir­ rhoe ;
and wished, that the might be brought to confusion at the trial.
But moft of the reft, being jealous of the beauties of their own country, prayed that the foreigner might, still maintain her shining reputation, and bear away the palm.
Both parties thought them- (elves Cure of the victory.
Dionyfius trusted in the letters which Mithridates was fuppofed to have writ to Callirrhoe, in Chareas's name, whom he imagined to be dead :
While, on the other, hand, Mithridates could produce Chæreas himself;
and thence was firmly per­ fuaded that no evil could befal him.
He yet pretended fear ;
and engaged many advocates, in tn order that the unexpected issue might make his defence the more glorious.
During these thirty days, the Perfians, both men and wo­ men, talked of nothing but the trial;
so that, to fay the truth, all Babylon teemed as one tribunal.
The day appointed for the de­ cifion appeared to have been too long de­ layed ;
not only to all the people, but even to the king himfelf.
What Olympic games, what Eleufinian nights, were, at any time, fo impatiently expected ?
But now the day of trial was come ;
when the king took his feat, in the apartment appointed Solely for hearing causes;
it being the most spacious, and mod magnificent faloon, in the whole palace.
In the center of this falcon flood the throne, with feats on each fide for the king's friends;
and for thofe who, either on ac­ count of their rank, or of their virtues, pof­ sessed the lirA employments in the govern­ ment.
merit.
Round the throne flood the centu­ rions, the Tribunes, and the most honourable among the king's freedmen :
whence it might justly have been said, of this assembly, that,The perfonages allowed seats, were introdu­ ced with filence and respect.
The morning being come, Mithridates firft entered the court, accompanied by his relations and friends j not fplendidly drest, nor with an open, chearful countenance;
but, on the contrary, discovering fuch a miferable aspect, as teemed to pronounce him guilty.
Dionyfius follow­ ed in a Grecian habit, wearing a Milesian.
robe, and holding the letters in his hand.
Being introduced, they paid their adoration, when the king commanded the fecretary to read the letters;
that of Pharnaces, and the anfwer answer to it:
in order that thofe who, with himfelf, were to judge the caute, might be made acquainted with the origin of the pro­ cefs.
The letters being read, the assembly gave the higher testimonies of applaufe;
all admiring the moderation and justice of their prince.
Silence being proclaimed, Dionyfius was to be heard firft, as the accuser ;
when all eyes were fixed upon him.
Neverthelefs Mithridates fpake thus :
(O my Liege !)
I would not anticipate my defence, and know well the order to be observed here ;
but be­ fore we proceed to the trial, it is necessary that all the parties should be prefent.
Where then is the woman who gave occasion to this contest?
whofe pretence thou (Royal Sir!) didft think necessary;
whore appearance thou did st command ;
and who is come to this city accordingly.
Let not then Dionysius se­ crete the perfon who is the chief, the first cause, cause, of the prefect session.——Here Dio­ nysius replied;
——It is acting too like an adulterer, to insist upon the bringing forth another man's wife, before a gazing multi­ tude, contrary to his will;
she being neither the accuser nor the person accufed.
Had she been feduced, she then ought to have been present, as a culprit;
but thou didft endea­ vour to corrupt Callirrhoe, who was wholly ignorant of thy machinations.
But I do not now want her, either as a witness or as an advocate.
What necessity then is there for her forth coming, as she is wholly unconcern­ ed in this process?—
—Thus argued Dio­ nysius, as a man well verged in the civil law ;
but his fubtilty and Specious eloquence had not the gift of perfuafion, because all longed to fec Callirrhoe.
As the king, though he wifhed for the fame, yet did not think it be­ coming his dignity to command her appear­ ance ;
ance ;
his friends artfully referred to his let­ ter, by which her prefence was declared ne­ cessary.
—
—Would it not be extremely abfurd (cried one) should this woman, who is come from Ionia, and now in Babylon, not make her appearance at the trial ?—
—It being then ;
refolved that Callirrhoe fhould come forth;
Dionyfius, who had not told her a word con­ cerning this affair, but even concealed the true motive of their journey to Babylon j fearing his wife's just anger, as she could not but think herself impofed upon, fhould he take her into court, without previously ac­ quainting her with his reasons for this;
he therefore put off the trial, till next day, and the court broke up.
V. Dionyfius now returned home;
and being a wife man, and a scholar, he held fuch difcourfes with his wife as suited the pre- sent sent exigency.
His arguments feemed plaufi­ ble and perfuafive;
he informing her, very readily and with great composure of mind, of each particular.
Callirrhoe could not hear him without tears;
and, at the name of Chæreas, the fighed and wept bitterly.
And now, shuddering at the thoughts of the trial, there words burft from her:
——To complete my wretchedness, the only thing wanting was, for me to be dragged before the judge.
I have been laid in the sepulchre as dead, and taken from thence by robbers:
I have been fold;
have been in slavery:
and now (O Fortune!)
I muft be forced to appear in a court of judicature.
It was not enough that thou didft induce Chæreas to think me guilty;
but thou alfo muft expofe me to be tried as an adulterer now I am married to Dionyfius.
By thy triumphant calumny, (O Fortune!)
I then was carried to the tomb;
and now now to the tribunal of a king.
I am become the jeft of Europe and of Alia.
With what eye shall I behold the judge ?
What words must I be contained to hear ?
0 treacherous beauty!
bestowed upon me by nature, only that I might be loaded with flander.
The daughter of Hermocrates is Summoned to a trial, where she has no father to plead her caufe.
Others, when they come before a court, fupplicate its favour and good-will;
whereas, hapless I, am afraid of appearing too agreeable in the eyes of my judge.
——Cal­ lirrhoe thus bemoaning herfelf, part the whole day fadly dejected in mind.
N.ght being come, she was conveyed in a dream to Sy­ racufe, where, in her virgin Hate, she feemed to enter the temple of Venus;
and, on her leaving it, to see Chæreas;
she likewise per­ ceived her nuptial day, and the whole city crowned with chaplets;
with.
her parents leading leading her to the bridegroom's house.
And flOW going (as the thought,) to kifs her dar­ ling Chæreas, fhe started suddenly from her Numbers, and called to Plangon;
for Dio­ nysius had risen before, in order to meditate upon the trial.
Plangon after being told the dream, fpake thus :
Be comforted (my good Lady!)
This vision is aufpicious both to thee, and to Chæreas.
Let nothing trouble thee.
All that thou faweft in thy sleep, thou wilt behold when awake.
Go then to the tribunal of the king, as to the temple of Ve­ nus.
Remember who thou art, and refume thy bridal charms.
—Saying thefe words, the dreft Callirrhoe very splendidly, who, from a secret impulse, grew chearful on a sudden, as an omen of her future felicity.
In the morning numberless multitudes flocked to the palace, all the avenues to which were now crowded.
Every one seemed desirous of hearing hearing the trial;
but the real motive was to get a fight of Callirrhoe;
nor were they deceived in their expectations;
so far from it, that she then as far surpassed herfelf in beauty, as file before out-(hone the rest of her fex, As the divine poet * represents Helen, appearing Suddenly before Priam, Panthous, and Thymoetes when debating:
Such Callirrhoe entered the court.
Her pre­ fence caufed univerfal astonishment apd fi­ lence ;
and all,And had the courfe of the proceedings re­ quired Mitbridates to fpeak first, he would have been bereaved of voice;
as his former paffion, for Callirrhoe, had now received a far deeper wound.
VI. Dionysius began his harangue in man­ nor following.
Most gracious Sovereign !
I return thee all imaginable thanks for the honour thou haft done me;
and not only me, but virtue also, and all married perfons in general.
For thou hast not contemned a private man whom one of thy chief officers has greatly injured;
but, on the contrary, hast fummoned him hither, to punish him for his leudness, and his infolent conduit towards me;
and to prevent other men from attempt­ ing the like actions for the future.
But this crime calls for a more fevere punishment, as he who committed it is of high rank.
Mi­ thridates, who far from being my enemy, was once my gueft and my friend, endea­ voured to rob me, not of any part of my elate, but of what I prize beyond body and foul, even of my darling wife.
This very man ought to have aided me, had.
any other person person offered fuch an infult;
if not for my sake, at kail out of reverence to thee, (my Liege!)
Thou haft entrusted him with the government of a mighty province;
of which he has proved himfelf unworthy ;
and there­ by betrays, and even reflects dishonour on those who repofed fuch confidence in him.
I am not ignorant of the solicitations, the power, and pomp, of which Mithridates avails himfelf on occafion of the prefent process.
I know that I am not upon an equal footing, with him, in thofe respects:
I yet rely, (0 mighty Prince !) on thy juftice ;
on the facred ties of marriage ;
and on the laws which thou doll adminifter impartially to all.
Sbouldeft thou difmifs Mithridates, it were much better that he had never been fummon­ ed hither;
as otherwise all men would have concluded, that injuries and infults could never escape punishment, when brought before before thy tribunal.
But on the contrary, should Mithridates, after being judged by thee, be fuffered to depart with impunity;
thou wilt henceforward be contemned.
My caufe is clear and concife.
I am hufband to Callirrhoe, and the has made me a father.
I married her, not when a virgin, but the widow of a certain Chæreas, who died fome time since;
and whore Mausolæum is now standing in our country.
Mithridates being In Miletus, and my gueft;
and having by that means an opportunity of feeing, pursuant to the laws of hospitality, my wife;
he did not behave afterwards as became a friend, a modeft, or a worthy man;
nor as thou re­ quirest thole to do, to whom thou doll en­ truft the government of thy cities:
He, on the contrary, acting with great infolence and tyranny.
Being afterwards fully convinced of Callirrhoe's strict virtue, and her great love love for me, her hufband;
and thence doubt­ ing whether it would be possible for him to,.
win her, either by perfuafions or by rich gifts;
he (a moft crafty man !) had recourse to wonderful artifices, as he imagined them to be.
Mithridates pretended that Chæreas, her first husband, is still living;
and having forged a letter, to my wife, in his name, he tent it to her by his fervants.
Thy fortune (mighty Monarch!) fuccoured me, who, (I trust) am not unworthy of thy countenance;
and, by the providence of the Gods, this letter was discovered:
for Bias, Prætor of Priene, fent it me, with the ser­ vants who had it in charge.
Having thus detected Mithridates, I informed Phamaces,.
governor of Lydia and Ionia, of this matter:
when he acquainted thee (0 Prince!) with the fame.
I have here fet forth the whole fact, of which thou art to judge.
The proofs proofs are inconteflible ;
for either Chæreas must be proved to be still living :
or Mithri­ dates mull:
be convicted as an adulterer.
He cannot fay, that he is ignorant of Chæreas's death;
as we have raided a monument, to his memory, in Miletus.
Mithridates himfelf was there, and accompanied the funeral pro­ ceffion.
But whenever he wants to seduce another man's wife, he can easily raife the dead.
I will now only mention the letter which he difpatched, by his fervants, from Caria to Miletus.
Do thou (secretary !) read it ——I, Chæreas, am ftill living.
Let Mi­ thridates prove this, and then be let at li­ berty.
Reflect (O my Liege!) how audacious that man must be, who dares to invent a fat­ fity, even with regard to a person deceased.—
Thefe words, pronounced by Dionyfius, firing the whole affembly, every voice was instantly in his favour:
when the king, in­ flamed flamed with anger, darted a fierce and me­ nacing look at Mithridates.
VII.
And now Mithridates, being no ways difmayed, replied:
——I bereech thee (O my king !) as thou art juft and merciful, not to condemn me unheard:
nor to permit calum­ ny to triumph over truth;
by thy giving cre­ dit to the malicious fiction which a worthless Greek has artfully invented concerning me.
I am fenfible, that the exquifite beauty of Callirrhoe, may naturally raife a fufpicion of me;
as it does not feem unlikely, but that an attempt may have been made to feduce her.
My past life has been chaste and temperate;
and I was never exposed, till now, to the darts of slander.
Besides, had I been of a lafcivious and abandoned difpofition, your entrusting me with the government of so many cities, mull have reformed me.
What man man could be fo void of fenfe, as to lose so many precious advantages, merely for the sake­ of indulging in one pleafure, and that of the brutal kind ?
Had I been conscious to my felf of the leaft guilt, I might have lawfully ob­ jected to the concerning my felf with this trial.
For Dionysius does not charge me with endeavouring to feduce a woman whom he bad lawfully married ;
but one who had been exposed to fate, and purchased by him.
Now slaves are not comprehended in the laws relating to adultery.
Let him first read to thee the instrument of manumission, and speak of the marriage afterwards.
And dareft thou to call this woman thy wife whom thou didst buy for a talent, of Theron the pyrate, after he had stole her from the sepulchre ?
But thou wilt fay thus:
She was free when I bought her.
In that cafe thou wouldest be a woman-stealer, rather than a husband.
hufband.
Nevertheless, I will now prove my innocence, as though thou wert really one.
Suppofe, for a moment, that the pur­ chafe was as the marriage, and the price, (a talent) as the dower;
and let her, though born in Syracufe, be confidered as a Mile­ fian :
I yet would have thee (my Liege!) to know, that I have not injured Dionyfius, ei­ ther as a husband or as a mafter.
In the hirA place, he accuses me of an adulterous act not yet committed, but intended:
and not being able to prove the fact, he produces a vain letter that proves nothing.
Now the laws punifh facts.
ShouldeR:
thou bring forth the letter;
I then could juftly affirm that it did not come from me.
Thou haft not my hand-writing.
Chæreas is in Search of Cal­ lirrhoe.
Charge him with adultery.
Yes, (fayeft thou) but Chæreas is dead ;
and thou wouldeft feduce my wife under his name.--- O O Dionyfius :
Thou haft made me a chal­ lenge, which will no ways turn to thy advan­ tage.
I conjure thee, as thy friend and thy gueft, to withdraw the charge.
Befeech the king to ftop all proceedings.
Recant all thy injurious expreffions;
and fay thus:
Mi­ thridates is innocent, and I accused him with­ out foundation.
But fhouldeft thou perfift in thy obftinacy, thou wilt repent it, and pronounce fentence againft thyfelf.
I foretell thee, thou wilt lore Callirrhoe, and the king will find thee, and not me, to be the adulterer.
Here Mithridates ftopt :
when the eyes of the whole affembly were turned to Dionyfius ;
they being anxious to know, whether, as it was left to his option, he would withdraw the accusation, or firongly perM in it:
for they were ftrangers to what Mithridates had hinted at obfcurely ;
but imagined that Dionyfius underwood his mean­ ing ing perfectly.
Now the latter, who did not know, nor could in the leaft fufpect, that Chæreas was ftill living, cried thus:
Say what thou wilt;
Thou fhalt not impofe upon me, either by fophiftry or by fpecious threats ;
nor fhall it ever be proved, that Dionyfius is a falfe accufer.
Here Mithridates, raif­ ing his voice, like as when the prieft, full of the God, is going to offer up facrifice, uttered there words :
Ye regal, celeftial and in­ fernal Deities!
0 ! fuccour a virtuous man, who, with pure hands, has frequently ad­ dreffed his vows to you;
and offered up the moft fplendid facrifices in your honour :
Do ye, as a reward for my piety, wipe off each provoking, each flanderous afperfion.
O ! lend me Chæreas, at leaft for this trial.
Ap­ pear, thou excellent fhade !
Thy Callirrhoe calls thee.
Stand, ftand between Dionyfius and and me;
abd tell the king, which of us two is the adulterer!
VIII.
Mithridates had Scarce ended, when, as had been concerted, Chæreas himself came forth.
Callirrhoe, at the fight of him, cried out:
And daft thou live, my Chæreas ?— the was flying to him, when Dionyfius, rufh­ ing in between, prevented their mutual em­ braces:
Now who could represent, in due colours, the face of this affembly ?
What poet ever brought, upon the ftage, fo un­ common, fo marvellous an incident?
Thofe present might imagine they beheld a theatre, where a thoufand oppofite paffions, all the impulfes of the foul, were viable ;
fuch as joy, grief, aftonifhment, pity, diftruft and defire.
They proclaimed Chæreas bleft;
they con­ gratulated Mithridates;
they pitied Dionyfius;
but, but, with regard to Callirrhoe, they were in doubt what to fay, or how to aft;
be­ caufe fhe, being all amazement and ftruck dumb, fixed her ardent eyes on Chaereas only.
It is my opinion, that the king himfelf would gladly have been Chæreas.
Rivals are ever ready to wrangle with one another ;
and the pretence of the inchanting prize heigh.
tened the interesting contention ;
infomuch that they would certainly have fought, had not the reverence, for their fovereign, re­ ftrained them.
However, their quarrel went no farther than words;
when the following dialogue enfued *:
I am the firft huf­ band,— band.
But I am more conftant, I having never drove away my wife ;
whereas thou didft bury her.
Shew me the inftrument of divorce.
—
—Seeft thou the Sepulchre ?— Callirrhoe's father difpofed of her, to me, in marriage.-
But the gave herself to me.—
Thou art unworthy the daughter of Hermo­ crates.
——Thou art Hill more fo, thou fhackled Have of Mithridates!
I am come to demand Callirrhoe.—But I poffefs her.-
Thou withholdeft another man's wife.—
Thou didft kill thine, Thou adulterer !—
Thou murtherer!——Thus did they con­ tend with, and reproach each other.
In the mean time Callirrhoe, with downcaft eyes, fhed a flood of tears ;
fhe loving Chæreas to the foul, yet blufhing on account of Dio­ nyfius.
nyfius.
The king then having commanded the contending parties to withdraw, he be­ gan to deliberate with his friends, not on Mithridates, who had made fo noble a de­ fence ;
but whether it would become him, to pronounce definitively, which of the two hufbands had a right to Callirrhoe.
Some were of opinion, that it would be beneath the king to take cognizance of fuch a fuit.—
Thou haft heard very juftly (faid they) the charge brought by Mithridates, he being a governor;
but the other two are private per­ tons.
——Neverthelefs moft thought diffe­ rently, both on account of Callirrhoe's fa­ ther Hermocrates, who had formerly been of fome fervice to the royal family:
and be­ caufe the king would not, on this occasion, judge a new caufe ;
but one, part of which he he bad already heard.
However, none of them cared to discover the true motive of the advice they gave, which was, that they could not bear to be deprived of the fight of Cal- Jirrhoe.
The king having font for thofe whom he, a little before, had commanded to leave the court, fpake thus:
I now ac­ quit Mithridatcs, who may fet out for his go­ vernment to-morrow, after having received the ufual prefents.
As to Chæreas and Dio­ nyfius, they may lay, before me, their re­ fpective claims to the woman;
for I ought to protect the daughter of that Hermocrates who, in a naval engagement, vanquifhed the Athenians, the moft hateful, the moft trou­ blefome enemies to me and to Perfia.
Artaxerxes having pronounced this fentence, Mithridates paid his adoration;
but the other parties parties were greatly furprized and exafperat­ ed, and knew not what to do;
which the king perceiving,—I fhall not (faid he) haften ye ;
but on the contrary, will allow ye five days to prepare for the trial;
and, when ye are ready, return hither.
In the mean time Statira, my contort, fhall take care of Cal­ lirrhoe :
it not being juft that a woman, the poffeffion of whom is contefted by two huf- . bands, fhould be brought into court by either of them.
The aflembly then broke up, with forrow and diffatisfaction in their coun­ tenances, Mithridates excepted, who was all joy;
and who, after receiving the royal gifts, flayed that night in Babylon, and next morning fet out for Caria, with greater Splen­ dor than before.
IX.
TheIX.
The eunuchs to whom Callirrhoe was delivered, conduced her to the queen, with­ out firft informing her of their coming ;
the king never fending previous notice, on any occafion whatfover.
Statira, at the fudden appearance of Callirrhoe, Parted from her bed ;
imagining that fhe faw Venus;
a god­ defs to whom fhe paid peculiar worship.
Immediately Callirrhoe proftrated herfelf be­ fore the queen, whofe error and furprize being perceived by the eunuch :
This (faid he) is Callirrhoe.
The king has rent her hither, in order that fhe may be under thine eye, till the day of trial.
—Statira heard this with pleafure;
when fuppreffing all female envy, fhe fhewed greater kindnefs to Callirrhoe, on account of the honour which Artaxerxes had done her, in giving fo exquisite a beauty to her her in charge.
The queen indeed was charmed with Callirrhoe, when taking her by the hand :
My dear woman (faid fhe) be comforted, and dry thy tears :
Artaxerxes is the moft benevolent, the moft gracious of princes.
Thou fhalt poffefs that hufband who is nearer to thy heart;
and, when the trial is over, thy nuptials fhall be folemnizcd with greater magnificence than before.
Go now and reft thyfelf;
as I perceive that thou art much fatigued, and thy mind vaftly un­ eafy.——
Callirrhoe was glad to hear there words, fhe wifhing much for repofe.
When fhe was put to bed, and every one retired, laying her hands on her eyes:
And have ye really, (faid fhe,) beheld Chæreas ?
Was it my own Chæreas ?
or was it an illufion ?
Perhaps Mithridates, in order to favour his Cult, fuit, called up this phantom at the trial;
for it is faid, that there are magicians in Perfia.
But then it fpake.
It related every particular, as though it.
had been an intelli­ gent Being.
Yet how could he refrain from embracing me?
We even Separated without a kits.
While Callirrhoe was ruminating on thefe things, fhe heard the found of feet, and female voices;
for all the women flocked to the queen ;
imagining that they might be indulged the full liberty of gazing on Callir­ rhoe.
But Statira faid :
—We mull:
not difturb her:
the is not well:
there will be days enough for us to fee, to hear, and to converfe with her.
Yet all went away greatly diffatisfied, but returned on the mor­ row ;
and crouded, in this manner, daily;
fo that the palace was much more frequented than than before.
The king himfelf came oftner to the apartments of the women, upon pre­ tence of vifiting Statira.
Many rich gifts were fent to Callirrhoe, but the conftantly refufed them all ;
fhe ftill appearing in the­ garb of an unfortunate woman;
being clad in mourning;
unadorned;
and fitting on the ground j notwithstanding which fhe appeared Rill more beautiful.
Being afked by the king, which of her hufbands the would pre­ fer;
fhe made no anfwer, but burft into tears.
Such was Callirrhoe's fituation, while Diony­ fius ftrove to bear his misfortunes like a man ;
he being endued with uncommon fortitude of foul, and devoting himself to the fludy of moral philofophy.
But fo great, fo un­ ufual, fo unexpected a woe, as that he la­ boured under, might eafily have overpowered the the ftrongeft brain.
His love was far more violent, than when he lived in Miletus;
as, in the infancy of his paffion, beauty only had attraaed him;
but now he was inflamed ftill more from many other causes;
fuch as familiarity and cohabitation with Callirrhoe :
Affection for the fond pledge fhe had brought him;
his fear left the fhould prove ungrate­ ful, and forfake him for another:
Jealoufy ;
and, above all, the extraordinary circum­ dances with which this incident was attended.
X. Dionyfius would often cry out on a fud­ den:
Who is this Protefilaus returned again, at this time, to life ?
What infernal Deity can I have offended, that I thus find a rival in one deceased, whofe fepulchre ftands
On my land ?
Thou (0 Venus!) haft laid fnares fdares for me, though I confecrated thee In various parts of my eftate, and offered up a multitude of Sacrifices in thine honour.
Wherefore didft thou fhew me Callirrhoe, If our union.
was not to be lafting ?
Why make him a father, who is not a hufband ?—
Then damping his fon, and fhedding a flood of tears:
— Ah!
haplefs infant, (cried he,) thy birth teemed aufpicious, but thou now art a burthen to me;
a fad inheri­ tance left me by thy mother;
a monument of an ill-fated paffion.
Thou, though a child, yet art not altogether infenfible of thy father's fufferings.
We fet but, with an evil omen, on our journey;
and Should not have left Miletus.
Babylon has been our our ruin.
I loft my caufe in the firft hear­ ing, when Mithridates was my accuser ;
and my chief fear arifes from the fecond, for there furely is not lefs danger in it;
and I entertain no hopes from the beginning of the trial, My wife has been torne from me, though I am yet un-fentenced ;
and I now contend, in great peril, with another man, for the poffeffion of her ;
and, what is ftill more aggravating, I know not on which of the two her choice may fall.
But thou (my darling child!) mayeft earn it from her, as fhe is thy mother.
Go then, and fuppli­ cate her for thy father.
Weep;
kifs her;
and fay:
Deareft mother!
My father loves thee.
But take care that thou employ not any any injurious or reproachful expreffions.
But (Pedagogue !) why do I talk thus wild­ ly ?
No one will permit us to enter the pa­ lace.
0 barbarous tyranny!
to fhut out a fon who carries, from his father, a moft tender meffage to his other parent.
In this manner did Dionyfius pafs his time, till the day of trial;
he acting as judge in this center between love and reafon ;
and re­ folving to beftow the palm on the victor.
On the other hand, Choreas, oppreffed with grief, was quite inconfolable:
when feigning himfelf lick, he ordered Polycharmus to accompany Mithridates, their common be­ nefactor, who was fetting out.
Being now left alone, he fixed a halter, when fpringing forward, in order to perpetrate a horrid deed, deed, he fpake thus:
I Should have quit­ ted life with lefs reluctance in Caria, when being a Cave, I was there faftened to the Crofs, on a falfe accusation:
for then I should have died in the fweet delufion that Callirrhoe still loved me;
whereas I now ball not only lore my life, but alfo the con­ folation I muft otherwife have found in death.
Callirrhoe faw me, and yet did not come forward.
She did not kits me;
but shew­ ed, in my pretence, a regard for another man.
However, she shall behave so no more, I will anticipate the fentence, and not wait for an inglorious end.
Poor and inconfider­ able as I am;
a foreigner, and quite un­ known, I muft necessarily be an unequal com­ petitor with, Dionyfius.
Yet mayest thou live live happy (O my wife!) for wife I still call thee, though thou lovest another man.
I shall now depart, for ever!
and not inter­ rupt thy conjugal felicity.
May riches fur­ round thee!
Mayeft thou luxuriate in de­ lights !
and long, long enjoy the splendors of Ionia.
Possess then the hufband who is dear to thee.
The last boon, which the dying Chæreas has to request is, that thou, when I shall be no more, mayeft approach my corps ;
and shed, if possible, a tear over it.
I shall prize this more than Im­ mortality.
Reclining on the pillar of my sepulchre, pronounce, at least, the follow­ ing words;
even though thy hufband, even though thy infant, should fee thee:
- Thou now, (O Chæreas!) art really gone;
thou now art dead.
Hadft thou lived, and the the king fat as judge, I then would have made choice of thee for my hufband.
I shall hear thy voice (O wife!) and, per­ haps, believe thee;
and, by thy means, I may acquire authority, and appear glorious in the eyes of the infernal Deities :
Thus bemoaning himfelf, he kissed the rope, crying out:
Thou art my consolation !
Thou my patron!
By thee I shall triumph over every woe ;
thou lovest me more than Callirrhoe.
Then fpringing forward to the halter, and fixing it round his neck, Po­ lycharmus entered on a sudden ;
and with­ held held him, as a man out of his fenfes;
and on whom neither Toothing words, nor' good counter had the leaft effect.
And now the] day appointed for the trial was at hand.
END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.
THEI.
AS the king was to pronounce the day following, whether Chæreas or Dionyfius should be the hufband of Callir­ rhoe, all Babylon was in tuppence;
every one faying, both at home and in the streets To- To morrow will be the nuptials of Callir­ rhoe.
Which of the two will, at laft, be.
the fortunate man ?
Now the city was di­ vided into two parties.
Thofe who favour­ ed Chæreas, faid :
He is the firft huf­ band :
he married Callirrhoe, when a virgin;
loving her, and being beloved.
He received Callirrhoe from her father.
She was buried by her country.
He did not forsake his wife, nor she abandon him.
Dionysius nei­ ther bought nor efpoufed Callirrhoe.
Rob­ bers fold her;
but it is not lawful to pur­ chafe a free-born woman.
On the other hand, the advocates for Dionysius fpake thus:
He rescued Callirrhoe from py­ rates, when expofed to their murthering dag­ gers ;
and gave a talent for her redemption.
He firft faved, and then took her to his bed.
Chæ- Chæreas, after marrying Callirrhoe, killed her.
She cannot have forgot her nuptials.
One ftrong argument that is apparent to all men, and which must Secure the victory to Dionyfius, is, her having borne him a son, who is Hill living.
Thus reafoned, among, themfelves, the men.
As to the women, they not only addressed Callirrhoe with the most animating exhortations;
but albo gave her advice, as though the had been present.
Do not quit (faid they) the hufband who efpoufed thee, when a virgin.
Take thy first lover, thy fellow citizen.
Thus mayest thou again behold thy father:
otherwise thou wilt live, as an exile, in a foreign land.
Others faid:
Prefer thy deliverer ;
he who faved, and did not assassinate thee.
Should Chæreas be fired anew with rage, thou then wouldest wouldest be again consigned to the tomb.
Do not betray thy fon, but honour his fa­ ther, Such, was the general difcourfe, throughout Babylon, which appeared as one court of Judicature.
It was now the night which preceded the day of trial, when the king and queen revolved, as they lay in bed, reflexions of a very different nature.
The queen wished earnestly for morning, in order to get rid of Callirrhoe, who was now a kind of burthen to her;
as the exquisite beauty of this Greek, gave rife to compari­ sons no ways advantageous to the queen, when both were feen together.
Farther:
The frequent visits paid by the king, and his great courtesy at unufual hours, raided the queers fufpicion;
as he, till then, had been rarely feen in the apartment of the women:
but but evet fince Callirrhoe's residence in the palace, he was running to them perpetually.
She alfo obferved, that while the king was conversing familiarly with Callirrhoe, he would frequently ogle her;
and dart fecret glances, which were directed to her from an involuntary impulse.
For thefe reafons, Sta­ lira was overjoyed at the near approach of the day of trial:
while far different thoughts employed the king;
he not fleeping a wink all that night, butPerplexed with a variety of thoughts, he was continually laying to himself:
The day of trial is near;
and I was too precipitate in not fixing it later.
What mull be done tomorrow morning ?
Callirrhoe will certain- ly ly return;
either to Miletus or to Syracuse.
There now remains a very short fpace of time;
a span, for me to feast on an inchant­ ing object;
after which, my Servant will be happier than I. Confider, (0 my foul!) what is to be done.
Be ever prefent and prepared.
No one fpreads fnares against thee but thy felf.
Cupid is now the beguiler of love.
Firft then anfwer thefe questions to thine own heart:
Who art thou ?
The lover of Callirrhoe, or her judge ?
But impofe not on thy felf.
Thou art deeply smitten, though thou knoweft it not.
-Of this thou wilt be fooner convinced, by not em­ ploying force againft her.
Why then thus torment thyfelf ?
Phoebus, from whom thou art descended, chofe and allotted, for thee, a creature the most lovely, the moft perfect, his his eye ever beheld:
and yet thou doft reject the gift of this God.
Thou art anxious for thy mean slaves, Chæreas and Dionyfius;
at a Time that thou art to decide, which of them fhall conquer in this trial, and be the huiband of Callirrhoe.
I, the mighty king, am acting the part of an antiquated Pander.
But then I have undertaken to judge this caufe, and the whole world, knows it.
But my greater uneafinefs, on this occasion, arifes from Statira.
Do thou therefore nei­ ther divulge thy passion, nor put an end to, the trial.
It will be enough for thee to gaze upon Callirrhoe.
Postpone therefore the de­ cision, fince a Plebeian judge might do this.
II.
As foon as it was day-light, the offi­ cers prepared the royal hall, when vast mul- titudes titudes flocked to the palace.
All Babylon was in motion ;
and, as in the Olympic games, the champions went to the field of exercife, followed, by a long train;
our two rivals were cfcorted in like manner.
Dionysius was accompanied by Persians of rank;
while Chæ­ reas was attended by the populace.
Ten thou­ fand voices and joyful acclamations were heard, of thole who favoured the respective parties, and wished them fuccefs;
crying:
-Justice is on thy fide.
It is thou wilt conquer.-
The prize, on this fignal occafion, was not an olive leaf, nor apples, nor the branch of a pine-tree ;
but the firft beauty in the world, for whom the gods themselves might justly have contended.
Now the king, having call­ ed for-the eunuch Artaxates his chief favou­ rite, fpake thus to him:
- The celestial Deities Deities having appeared to me on a sudden, in a dream, and required victims ;
I there­ fore muft acquit myself of the duty which piety, towards them, demands.
Be then aH Alia enjoined to celebrate a folemn festival, during thirty days;
and let every kind of bufinefs, all law proceedings, be fufpended during that time.
Artaxates published the royal ordinance ;
when immediately the city was crouded with multitudes, crowned with chaplets, and offering up sacrifices.
Nought was heard but the warbling of flutes, and the found of rural pipes, intermixed with voices.
Incenfe was burnt in the courts be­ fore each houfe, and banquets were feen in every ftreet.
The The king prefented fplendid victims at the altar.
He then facrificed, for the firft time, to the God of Love, among other Deities;
. and frequently addressed Venus, beseeching that goddefs to interceed powerfully, with her fon, in his favour.
Amid this general joy, three persons only were in the deeper affliction;
Callirrhoe, Dionyfius ;
and, more than either, Chæreas.
Callirrhoe could not show her grief, as The was in the palace;
but then the groaned bitterly in fecret, and vented dreadful imprecations againft the fefti­ val.
But Dionysius called for curves upon himseif, for his having left Miletus:
—Wretch that thou art, (cried he) fubmit patiently to evils which thou haft brought upon thyself!
Thou mighteft have possessed Callirrhoe, even though Chæreas had been living:
Thou waft wast the master in Miletus;
and not a letter could have been delivered, to Callirrhoe, with­ out thy content.
Who could have feen ;
who could have come near her ?
Thou now haft thrown thyfelf, spontaneously, into the midft of thine enemies;
and would it were thy felf only, and not the object who is dearer to thee than thy foul!
Hence art thou furiously attacked on every fide.
What fayeft thou (Madman!)
Chæreas is thy adversary, and thy fovereign is become thy rival.
The king now fees visions;
and the gods demand of him those victims which he sacrifices to them daily.
Shameful conduct!
for a man, who has the wife of another in his houfe, to pro­ tract a trial, and yet fet up for a judge.
Thus did Dionyfius lament his wretched fate :
during which Chæreas, refufing the least sustenance, sustenance, and being refolved to give up life ;
he thus addreffed his friend Polycharmus, who would not permit him to die of hunger.-
Thou, under the femblance of a friend, art my greater enemy ;
because thou doft keep me in torments, and art delighted with my pains.
Were thou my friend, thou would­ eft not envy my attempt, to free myself from the cruel tyranny under which, by the malevolence of I know not what Deity, I fo fhamefully groan.
How often might I have been blest, had it not been for thee ?
Thrice happy were my lot, had I been buried in Syracufe with Callirrhoe !
But when I wished earnestly to die, thou didft withhold my hand;
and thereby deprive me of the sweetest companion to the shades be­ low.
Perhaps she would not have left the fe­ sepulchre, nor have abandoned me, though dead.
And had she quitted me, I now should be lying peaceably in the grave;
and thereby have avoided flavery ;
the band of pyrates;
chains;
and, what is still more grievous, to me, than even crucifixion, the king.
Death would have been welcome to me, for then I should not have heard of the Second nuptials of Callirrhoe.
And, since the opening of the trial, Should I not have left the world, hadst thou not pre­ vented me ?
I faw Callirrhoe, but could not approach, nor kifs her.
0 unparelleled and incredible incident!
It is disputed in a court of justice, whether Chæreas is, or is not, the husband of Callirrhoe.
But envious fate will not permit this trial, whatever may be the refult of it, ever to come to a period.
I am hated by the gods, both fleeping and wak­ waking:
Chæreas having uttered thole words, was going to rufh upon his sword, when Polycharmus stopped his hand;
and, holding him fast, thereby prevented his de­ ftroying himfelf.
III.
The king having font for his most faithful eunuch, was at firft afhamed to fee him :
when Artaxates perceiving his confu­ sion, and the difficulty with which he utter­ ed his words, faid thus Why doll thou (O my liege !) conceal any thing from thy fervant, who wishes thee every felicity, and can faithfully trcafure up a secret ?
What mighty evil can have befallen thee ?
Much I fear, that Shares are spread for thee :
-
Very dangerous ones, (replied the Monarch) are preparing ;
yet not by a mortal, but by a a Deity.
Who Cupid is, I had already learnt, both from profe-writers, and from poets;
and that all the gods are fubject to his em­ pire, and even Jupiter :
-But then I doubted, whether any of them was mightier than my­ felf.
But that God is now prefent ;
and, with the ftrongeft impetuofity, has taken paffeffion of my whole heart.
It is grievous to confefs it;
and yet I mufl be forced to reveal the truth, which is, that I am the cap-. tive of this god:
—In uttering there words, a violent flood of tears burft from him, and flopped his tongue.
And now Artaxates discovered, by the king's fudden filence, who it was that had wounded him ;
for his tears were not feigned, and the eunuch had before obferved his riling paffion ;
and indeed it was obvious, and beyond all doubt, that Artax- erxes, erxes, whenever Callirrhoe was prefent, could not be enamoured of any other wo­ man.
Nevertheless the eunuch, pretending ignorance on this occasion, faid:
What fair-one (O king !) how charming foever, can have enflaved thee, whom all things beauti­ ful obey?
as gold, filver, rich veftments, horres, cities, nations ;
and many lovely wo­ men;
efpecially Statira, the moft charming of her fex under the fun, and who is enjoy­ ed by thee only.
Thou indeed mayeft not now covet her, as poffeffion is apt to take away defire ;
except that fome goddefs
Should be descended from the fkies, or another Thetis rifen from the ocean :
for it is my opi­ nion that the Deities would wilh for thy con­ verfe.
— Perhaps (faid Artaxerxes) thou haft now fpoke the truth, in fuppofing this woman woman to be a divinity, for her beauty is more than human.
However, fhe will not own this, but feigns herfelf a Greek of Syra­ cufe.
Now a circumftance which feems to indicate deceit, is the precaution the has taken, to prevent her being detected in a falfity ;
I mean her not mentioning a city within our empire ;
but fixing the fcene of her ftory beyond Ionia, and crofs a wide-extended ocean.
She is come hither upon pretence of a trial, but the whole is a fiction of her own invention.
I am amazed how thou canft call Statira the moft beautiful among women, when Callirrhoe is prefent.
But I muft free my felf from this anxiety.
Do thou employ all the powers of thy imagination ;
and dif­ cover, if poffible, a remedy for me.
——My Liege ! (replied Artaxates,) the remedy thou feekeft feekeft is to be met with equally among the Greeks and Barbarians.
The only cure, for thy paffion, is to poffefs the beloved object.
This doubtless is the meaning of the renown­ ed oracle, viz.
They who inflict a wound can alfo heal it.
-The king, afhamed at what he heard, cried:
Prefume not to advife me to reduce another man's wife.
I well remember the laws which I myfelf fra­ med, and the jufiice I cxercife on all occafions.
I cannot charge myfelf with intemperance of any kind ;
nor am I captivated to fo violent a degree.
Artaxates fearing that he had fpoke too inadvertently, turned his difcourfe to praife, by faying:
——My fovereign!
ge­ nerous, and worthy of thy felf is thy way of thinking.
Apply not that remedy to love, which is employed by other men ;
but a more more efficacious, a princely remedy, I mean, the combating thine own inclinations ;
for thou, Singly, mayefl vanquifh that Deity.
Devote thy felf to pleafures of every kind.
Hunting is thy favourite diverfion;
I having feen thee pafs whole days in that exercife (fo great was thy fondness for it,) without eating or drinking.
It is better to purfue the chafe, than to flay in the palace by the fire-fide.
IV.
This advice being approved, a royal chafe was proclaimed.
There then marched forth, on horfeback, foldiers richly habited ;
with the chief nobles of Perfia, and the flower of the army;
the whole making a muft magnifi­ cent fpectacle.
But, above all alione the king, he being mounted on a tall and moft beautiful Nifean horfe ;
whofe bridle, and the Several trappings, trappings, were of gold.
He was clad in a robe of tyrian purple of Babylonifh work.
On his head was a yellow Tiara.
A golden fcymitar was girded on his thigh.
He held two darts in his hand.
By his fide hung his bow and quiver, the precious workmanship of China.
He fat his horfe with a fierce air.
Love is naturally fond of fplendor in drefs.
Artaxerxes was defirous of being beheld, in the midft of his retinue, by Callirrhoe;
and, as he paffed through the city, he gazed on every fide, to fee whether file did not furvey the pompous proceffion from fome eminence.
Immediately the mountains echoed with the fhouts of hunters;
the barking of dogs ;
the neighing of hordes ;
and the cries of rouzed wild beafts.
Such universal tumult might have banifhed love from the breast of any other other man ;
as this sport was very laborious;
joy being intermixed with fear, and pleafure with danger.
But as to the king, he did not fec a fingle horfe, though fo many horfemen ran before him:
nor one wild beaU, though fuch numbers were chafed:
nor could he hear the barking of dogs, though fuch mul­ titudes were abroad;
nor the cries of the people, though fuch crouds were affembled.
He raw Callirrhoe only, though fhe was ab­ rent, and heard no other voice, though the fpake not.
Cupid accompanied him in the chafe:
and as a Deity who is pleaded with contention, feeing his adverfary armed againft him, and in battle array;
and acting very wifely in his own conceit;
the amorous god turned the monarch's arts upon himfelf;
and, employing the fame remedies, thereby inflam­ 3 ed ed him the more:
and having got poffef­ lion of the inward recedes of the king's heart, he whifpered it thus:
How de­ lightful would it be to fee Callirrhoe here, in a fhort veft;
her arms bare;
with a ruddy countenance :
out of breath, andAnd thus imaging Callirrhoe to his mind, his paffion increafed to a violent degree *.
************
Saying there words, Artaxates replied:
My My Liege!
Thou haft forgot what is paft.
Callirrhoe has no hufband :
and the law has not yet determined to whom fhe fhall be de­ livered :
Reflect then that thou loveft a wi­ dow.
Fear not the laws, as there relate to marriage ;
nor be apprehensive of thy com­ mitting adultery;
fince, in that cafe, there muft firft be a hufband who had been injured, and then an adulterer who wronged him.—
There words were highly pleating to the mo­ narch, they foothing his paffion ;
when throw­ ing his arms round the eunuch's neck, he kiffed him, and faid:
——It is with juftice that I efteem thee above all others, as thou beared me the warmer affection, and art my beft overfeer.
Go therefore and bring Cal­ lirrhoe to me, but in the manner I fhall corn­ mand ;
that is, privately, and without corn­ pulfion ;
pulfion ;
for thou muft employ perfuafion and artifice.
Inftantly the king founded a re­ treat, and departed full of joy, imagining that he had made Callirrhoe his lovely prize.
Artaxates was not lets delighted, as thinking he was going upon a noble commiffion :
and.
that, for the future, he fhould govern the court entirely ;
not doubting but both the king and Callirrhoe would be very willing to promote him, in reward of this fervice.
But he relied chiefly on Callirrhoe.
Artaxates being a eunuch, a flave, and a Barbarian, thought this an eafy tafk ;
he not having any idea of the generous fpirit of the Greeks ;
ef­ pecially of Callirrhoe's natural modefty, and the extreme love the bore her hufband.
V.
The eunuch, watching a proper op­ portunity, came to Callirrhoe, when taking her her apart:
— Woman, (faid he,) I offer thee an invaluable treasure.
Thou wilt not for­ get the Signal Service I now do thee;
I be­ lieving thee to be of a grateful difpofition.—
Callirrhoe was in raptures at the opening of this Speech;
as we naturally expect what we ardently wifh.
Thus fhe did not doubt but that Chæreas would be reftored to her in­ ftantly.
This fhe longed to hear;
and there­ fore promised to recom pence Artaxates, for bringing fuch joyful news.
Artaxates, after much circumlocution, went on as follows.-... Indulgent nature, (0 woman !) has bellowed on thee divine beauty ;
but this has not hi­ therto been of any fignal, any mighty ad­ vantage.
That name, fo much renowned throughout the world, has not yet found a hufband or a lover worthy of it;
on the con­ contrary, it fell to the lot of two men, the one a pitiful Kinder, and the other a vaffal of the king.
Has any thing great or Splendid accrued to thee by their means ?
What fruit­ ful lands, what rich, female ornaments have they brought thee ?
What cities doft thou govern ?
What Haves proftrate themselves at thy feet ?
The Babylonifh matrons keep fer­ vants richer than thee.
Yet art thou not to­ tally neglected.
Even the gods are mindful of thee.
For this they conducted thee hither, upon pretence of the trial, in order that the great king might behold thee:
and the licit joyful news I falute thee with, is, that he fees thee with delight.
I frequently call thee to his remembrance, and am ever fpeaking to him in thy praife.
—
—Thefe laft words Vere not true ;
it being the cuftom for all Haves, flaves, whenever they fpeak to their mafters concerning any one, to commend themselves at the fame time, imagining that this may turn to their own advantage.
Though there words were as daggers to Callirrhoe's heart, fhe yet pretended not to underhand them, but faid:
May the gods be ever propi­ tious to the king, and the king to thee ;
fince thou art moved to companion for an unfortu­ nate woman!
I only implore Artaxerxes, to free me as fOOD as poffible from my anxiety, by fini(hing the trial ;
that I may no longer be an incumbrance to any one, and especially to the queen.
The eunuch thinking that he had not fufficiently expreffed his meaning;
and that CalUrrhoe did not underhand him, fpake more plainly, as follows:
——In one circumftance thou, (0 woman!) art ex- tremely tremely fortunate, which is, that neither Haves nor mean persons are thy lovers;
but the great king, who can beftow on thee Mi­ letus, and all Ionia ;
together with Sicily, and other more considerable nations.
Sacri­ fice then to the gods;
pronounce thyfelf bleft;
do every thing in thy power, -to pleafe the monarch more and more :
and when thou fhalt be wealthy, let not Artaxates be for­ got.——
Callirrhoe would, at firft, have glad­ ly tome out the reducer's eyes, had this been poffible:
but knowing mankind ;
and being able to, govern her temper ;
recollecting im­ mediately the place the was in ;
who fhe her­ felf was;
and the person who fpake, her rage foon changed into fcorn of this Barba­ rian.
1 am not, (faid fhe) fo weak as to fancy myfelf worthy of the great king;
I being being no ways fuperior to the naves of the Perfian ladies :
I therefore intreat thee, moft earneftly, never to mention me again to thy fovereign;
for though he is not now difpleafed with thee, he doubtlefs will afterwards be exafperated, when he calls to mind, thy hav­ ing fubjected, to the Have of Dionyfius, the mafter of the world.
I am furprized that thou, being the wifeft of men, fhouldeft be a ftranger to the king's humanity;
he not loving an unfortunate woman, but pitying her.
Let us then break off this difcourfe, left fome one fhould calumniate us to the queen.
At thefe words the ran away fwiftly, leaving the eunuch dumb and Spirit­ lefs;
for he, having been brought up under a fupremely-tyrannical government, had fup- pofed pored that nothing was impoffible to the king, nor even to himself.
VI.
Artaxates being now left alone, and not thought worthy of an answer, went away, tortured by a thousand different paffions.
He was angry at Callirrhoe;
he was vexed on his own account;
and he dreaded his fo­ vereign's difpleafure j concluding that Ar­ taxerxes would not, perhaps, believe that he had talked with Callirrhoe on this fubject, though ineffectually;
but, on the contrary, muft certainly fuppofe, that he had betrayed his truft, purely to oblige the queen.
Laftly, he was apprehenfive that Callirrhoe would acquaint Static with their whole converfa­ lion ;
and that fhe, exasperated at this, would me- meditate fome grievous vengeance againft him;
for his having been, not only the meffenger in this amour, but albo the promoter of the king's paffion.
In the mean time the eunuch revolved, in his own mind, how he might in­ form the king of all that had paft, without injuring himfelf.
And now Callirrhoe, being alone, reflected thus :
Alas !
I prefaged all that is come to pars.
0 Euphrates!
Thou art witness that I foretold I fhould never crofs thy ftream again.
Farewell father !
Fare­ well mother!
Farewell my native Syracufe !
I never fhall behold ye more.
Callirrhoe is now really dead at laft.
I efcaped indeed from the fepulchre;
but not even Theron the pyrate could take me from hence.
O infidi­ ous Beauty!
Thou art the caufe of all my fuf­ fufferings.
Through thee I was killed * ;
through thee was fold;
through thee was married to Dionyfius;
through thee was forced away to Babylon;
and through thee I appeared at the trial.
To how many evils haft thou expofed me?
To robbers;
to the ocean ;
to the fepulchre ;
to flavery;
to the trial;
and, far worfe than all thefe, to the king's love.
I will not here fpeak of his anger, I dreading, fUll more, the queen's jealousy:
a paffion, which Chæreas himfelf, though a Greek, could not conquer.
What then may not a woman, a barbarous miftrefs, perpetrate?
Come then (Callirrhoe!) refolve on fome heroic act, worthy the daughter of Her- Hermocrates.
Kill thyself!
yet ftay a little ;
for that was merely a conference, and made through the channel of an eunuch.
Should, violence be ufed with regard to me;
then will be the time for me to prove my fidelity to Chæreas, and that in his prefence ——
And now Artaxatcs going to the king, con­ cealed from him all that had paft;
alledging bufinefs in excufe, and the ftrict eye which the queen kept over Callirrhoe ;
insomuch that it was next to impoffible to get admit­ tance to her.
Thou, (faid he) my Liege !
didft command me to keep this affair fecret;
and that with reafon and juftice, as thou haft affumed the venerable character of a judge;
and doft ftudy to gain the affection of the Perfians, for which the higheft applaufes are bellowed on thee univerfally.
The Greeks wrangle wrangle for mere trifles, and are a loqua­ cious people.
Now fhouldeft thou make the leaft attempt, they would immediately blazon it to the world:
Callirrhoe out of vanity, for being beloved by a king;
Dionyfius, and Chæreas, out of jealoufy.
Befides, it would not be proper to difguft the queen, whore beauty this trial has heightened.
Thus, out of deeming regard to his fovereign, he threw many obftacles in his way;
in order to divert him, if poffible, from this paffion ;
and to free himfelf from fo very difficult a commiffion.
VII.
The eunuch's perfuafion was effectual at that junctare;
but night being come, the king found himfelf re-inflamed, when the amorous god thus whimpered him:
How be­ bewitching are Callirrhoe's eyes!
How lovely her lips !
-He then praifed her trefles, her mien, her voice.
Next, with what grace fhe entered the court of juftice !
and with what dignity fhe flood there !
how inchanting her Speech !
How eloquent her filence !
Her joy how fweet!
Her tears how beautiful!
Thus did the king pafs almoft the whole night without fleep ;
except while he faw, for a few moments, Callirrhoe in a dream.
And now, waking in the morning, he called to him the eunuch, and faid :
Go, and be upon the watch the whole day, for thou doubtlefs wilt find means to talk privately with Callirrhoe, though but for a few minutes.
Was I inclined to fatiate my defires openly, and to employ force, my Satellites would be ready for that purpose.
Artaxates having paid paid his adoration, promifed to obey the royal injunction ;
no one being permitted to oppofe the king's commands.
However, knowing that Callirrhoe would not give him an oppor­ tunity of fpeaking to her ;
but, on the con­ trary, would always keep near the queen, purpofely to prevent his talking with her:
to remedy this evil, Artaxates turned the fubject, not to the woman who was watched, but to her keeper.
—
—If it pleafe thee, my Liege ! (faid he) fend for Statira, as though thou hadft fome fecret to communicate;
by which tneans her abfence will give me an opportu­ nity of converging at leifure with Callirrhoe.—
Let this be done, (replied the king).
Artaxates then waiting on the queen, paid his adoration, and faid :
Princefs !
Thy hufband requires thy prefence.- Statira prof­ trated trated herfelf, on hearing the king's name;
and riling, flew to him.
The eunuch, now finding Callirrhoe apart from the queen, took the former by the hand, as though he had been a friend to the Greeks, and of a humane difpofition;
and drew her from among the croud of waiting-women.
Callirrhoe, though fhe underwood his meaning;
yet follow­ ed him pale and fpeechlefs.
They being alone, he addreft her in thefe words:
Didft thou observe how the queen, the in­ ftant the heard the name of Artaxerxes, fell proftrate, and then ran to him ?
Yet thou, though a flave, canft not bear thine own fe­ licity ;
nor art fatisfied that he, who could command thy pretence, is fo gracious;
and does thee fo fignal an honour, as to invite and intreat thee.
However, having a refpect for for thee, I would not inform the king of thy folly;
but, on the contrary, have promifed fomething in thy name.
Two paths now lie open before thee.
Which of them wilt thou ftrike into ?
I will point out both.
If tho.u comply with the king's will, thou wilt re­ ceive very precious gifts;
and obtain the huf­ band who is the object of thy wifhes ;
for Artaxerxes will not marry thee, but thou wilt delight him for tome time.
On the con­ trary, fhouldeft thou disobey, hear what they undergo who are enemies to the king ;
fuch only are not permitted to die, when they with for death.
Callirrhoe Smiling:
This' (faid fhe) is not the firft time I have fuffered evils.
I have been long acquainted with mi­ fery.
What punifhment could the king in.
flict, more grievous than that which now tortures tortures me ?
I have been buried-alive;
and no prifon is fo contracted as the grave.
I was delivered into the hands of robbers, and now endure the greater of all evils, being deprived of the fight of my Chæreas.
There words betrayed her ;
for the eunuch, being fharp and fubtle, thereby found that fhe entertained a paffion for fome one ;
and thereupon, faid Thou Purely mull:
be the moft foolifh of thy fex, to prefer the flave of Mithridates to the king.
—Callirrhoe, exafperated to hear Chærcas mentioned thus contemptuoufly, cried:
Speak, (O man !) more refpectfully :
Chæreas is of noble birth, and chief of that city which withftood the arms of the Athenians, who yet overthrew thy great king at Marathon and at Salamis.—
Having uttered there words, fhe burn into a flood flood of tears ;
when Artaxates faid :
——
Thou art the caufe of the delay of this trial.
To obtain favour from thy judge, thou muft yield to his defires, and thou thereby wilt again poffefs the hufband who is dear to thee.
Chæreas may poffibly know nothing of this affair;
and, fhould he be informed of it, he will not be jealous of one who is fo greatly his fuperior;
but, on the contrary, mutt efteem thee ftill more for thy having pleafed the king.
The eunuch added thefe laft words ;
not to foothe Callirrhoe, but becaufe they were his real fentiments :
for all the Bar­ barians behold their monarchs with awe and aftonifhment ;
and confider fuch as Deities revealing themfelves to mortals.
With regard to Callirrhoe, fhe would not have accepted of the nuptials of even Jove himfelf;
nor pre­ preferred immortality to the paffing a fingle day with Chæreas.
Artaxates, finding he could not work upon Callirrhoe :
Wo­ man !
(faid he) I will give thee leifure to de­ liberate bn thefe things.
In the mean time, think ferioufly, not merely for thine own fake, but alfo for that of Chæreas, who cer­ tainly is in danger of fuffering a moft cruel death;
for the king will not bear to fee an­ other preferred to himfelf in an affair of love.
—
—The eunuch then withdrew ;
and his laft words were as a poniard to Callir­ rhoe's heart.
VIII.
But fortune gave a fudden turn td all thefe conferences, and love negotiations ;
and changing the fcene, furnifhed matter for new incidents, Expreffes now brought ad- vice vice to Artaxerxes, that the Egyptians hav­ ing raifed a mighty and moft formidable army, were in open rebellion ;
and after murthering the governor fet over them by the king, had elected a monarch from among their countrymen ;
who, having marched through Pelufium, was making dreadful ha­ vock in Syria and Phœnicia, which they over-ran ;
infomuch that the cities in general were no more able to refift the fury of their arms, than an impetuous flood or a raging flame.
At this news the king was greatly alarmed.
And the Perfians were thunder-ftruck;
all the Babylonians wore forrowful countenances, and fear diftracted their minds.
Then the interpreters of dreams and the foothfayers declared, that the king's vifion had foretold what would come to pafs t pafe :
for as the gods, by demanding vic­ tims, firewed that danger was at hand, it denoted victory at the fame time.
As ufual, every thing was now faid, every thing done, which a fudden, and unexpected war might require;
and all Alia was in confufion.
The king then fummoned the principal Perfians;
and as many governors of different nations as were at court, whom he ufed to confult on matters of high importance.
The council differed widely in opinion, when debating on the present crifis.
But it was unanimoufly agreed, that expedition would be neceffary ;
and that not a fingle day, ought to be loft, and this for two reasons:
Firft, to prevent the enemy from increafing ;
and fecondly, to animate their friends, by fhewing fhewing them that fuccour was nigh.
It was added, that delay would produce the con­ trary of this, fince their enemies would then defpife them as cowards;
and their friends fubmit, finding themselves neglected.
That it was extremely fortunate for the king, that this advice had been brought him, not in Bactria nor in Ecbatana, but in Babylon, near to Syria;
because, had he croffed the Euphrates, the rebels would have been im­ mediately upon him.
It was therefore judg­ ed expedient, to order all the troops near at hand to march forth ;
and to iffue a pro­ clamation, commanding all the forces, where- foever difperfed, to alembic on the banks of the Euphrates.
The Perfians can, with the greater eafe, raife an army;
Cyrus, their their firft monarch, having promulgated an ordinance, fetling, which nations fhould fur­ nifh the cavalry, and what number;
which people the infantry, and how many;
which the bow-men and their number;
which Should fend chariots armed with fcythes, or un­ armed ;
from what region the elephants were to come, and how many :
likewise the other articles, each country, refpectively, was to contribute.
Now all thefe contingents could be provided, by the various nations, in as fhort a time as a fingle man can fit out himfelf.
IX.
The fifth day after the arrival of the news, the king marched from Babylon, fol­ lowed by thofe who were of age to bear arms;
arms;
all fuch being ordered to attend.
Among them came Dionyfius, who was aa Ionian ;
for no fubject or dependent was per­ mitted to flay behind.
Being clad in rich and beautiful armour, and his attendants forming a considerable band;
he took poft among the firft and moft illuftrious perfo­ nages.
Dionyfius feemed to meditate fome great exploit, he being naturally ambitious :
and entertaining the higheft idea of valour, he thought it one of the nobleft virtues.
He likewife had fome faint hopes, that could he make himself of ufe in this war, he then might escape the law-fuit;
and receive Cal­ lirrhoe from the king, as a recompence for his bravery.
The queen would not take Callirrhoe with her, and therefore did not not once mention her to the king;
nor afk him how the foreigner fhould be difpofed of.
Artaxates was alfo filent on this head ;
he not daring, as his Sovereign was in fo much danger, to remind him of an amour.
The truth was, he would gladly have got rid of Callirrhoe, as of a wild beaft ;
and it is my opinion, that he was pleafed with the war, fince it might cure the king of a paffion which indolence had begun and fomented.
But Artaxerxes did not forget Callirrhoe;
he, even amid the inexpreffible tumult and confufion, recalling her beauty to his memory.
And yet he was not willing to fay what Should be done with her, left he might betray a childifh weakness ;
by having mentioned a beautiful woman, in the beginning of fo mighty a war.
However the king, urged'by the violence of his flame, thought of the follow­ ing artifice, but unknown either to Statira or to the eunuch;
though the latter knew of his paffion.
It is cuftomary for the king, and the chief men among the Perfians, when they go to war, to take with them their wives and children;
their gold, filver, and apparel ;
their eunuchs, concubines, and tables;
as likewise their precipus furniture, and all their instruments of luxury.
The king then lent for the fuperintendant over all there matters;
and after much difcourfe with bim, and giving orders with refpect to every particular article;
he at laft mentioned Callirrhoe, when affuming an air of indif­ ference, as though he had not the leaft re­ gard for her:
Let that poor, foreign creature, (faid the monarch) whofe caufe I have have undertaken to hear, follow the other women.
Thus did Callirrhoe leave Baby­ lon, and very willingly, as fhe hoped that Chæ­ reas would quit it alfo.
She calling to mind, that the event of war is uncertain;
that vi­ ciffitudes are often of advantage to the un­ happy;
and that poffibly a period would be put to the trial, by the Speedy conclufion of a peace.
END OF THE SIXTH BOOK.
THEI.
c HÆREAS was not Summoned to the field, while all the reft marched forth, with the king at their bead, againft the Egyptians ;
Chæreas not being a fubject of Artaxerxes ;
and the only freeman then in Babylon;
Babylon;
a circumstance which filled him with joy, as he had flattered himfelf that Callirrhoe would continue there likewife:
He thereupon went next day to the palace to enquire for his wife ;
but finding it shut, and a strong guard at the gates, he ran all over the city in fearch of her;
and was inces­ fantly calling out to his friend Polycharmus, like one distracted :
Where is Callirrhoe ?
What is become of her ?
She Purely cannot be gone with the army !
But not finding her, he flew to the houfe of his rival Dio­ nysius, whence a perfon came out in a feem­ ing hurry;
who told Chæreas whatever he had been taught to fay.
For Dionyfius being refolved to deprive Chæreas of all hopes of ever recovering his wife;
and desirous that he fhould depart before the trial was ended, had had therefore thought of the following stra­ tagem.
At his fetting out for the war, he left a perfon to inform Chæreas
That the king of Persia, being in want of allies, had rent Dionysius to raife forces againft the Egyptians;
and, to induce him to ferve with fidelity and difpatch, had restored to him Callirrhoe.
—Chæreas immediately gave credit to what he heard, the unfortunate being very eafily impofed upon.
And now tearing his cloaths and his hair, and touting his breaft, he thus cried :
- 0 faithless Babylon!
0 abominable receptacle !
and quite a defart with regard to me!
Moft admirable judge, thus a pander to another man's wife !
Nuptials in the raidst of war I was medi­ tating and preparing my caufe;
and am fully persuaded that I should have pleaded it with truth truth and eloquence.
But I now am con­ demned though absent;
and Dionyfius, who has sled from the trial, is victor without having uttered a fingle word.
He yet shall not en­ joy his conqueft ;
for Callirrhoe will not bear to live, thus fevered from her Chæreas, who is Hill living, and here prefent.
He deceived Callirrhoe at firft, by making her believe that I was dead.
Why then do I not murther myself before the palace;
and pour forth my blood at the gates of my judge ?
Let the Perfians and Medes know the injustice of the king's decision.
Polycharmus find­ ing that no words, no arguments could divert Chæreas from his fad resolution;
and that it would be impoffible to save him, spake thus:
There was a time (my deareft friend !) when sost language from me, could, give give thee consolation;
and fach has often prevented thy destroying tbyfelf:
but I now think thou doft determine most wifely;
and, so far from being an obstacle on this occafion, I rather am prepared to die with thee.
Let us then confider which is the noblest kind of death;
for that mentioned by thee, though it might cast an odium on the king, and dis­ grace him with posterity;
yet would it not be a revenge adequate to the evils we have suffered.
I therefore am of opinion, that the death, to which we muft one day submit, ought to be employed in taking vengeance on the tyrant.
How glorious will it be, after our having made a mighty daughter of the troops of our foe;
and done him every other mifchief, to force him to repent ?
How much will it redound to our glory, when it shall be be related in hiftory, that two Greeks, whd had been wronged by an unjuft fentence of the great king;
afterwards revenged their injuries, and died as became brave men ?
But how (refumed Chæreas,) will it be pof­ fible for us, indigent and banifhed men, fing-
Jy to annoy a prince, master of so many and fuch powerful nations;
and commander over fuch mighty armies, as we ourfelves saw;
a prince protected and furrounded by fo vast a number of centinels and body-guards ?
and though we should happen, at last, to kill one of thefe, or burn one of his palaces ;
he yet would not feel the loss.
—
—Thy arguments, (replied Polycharmus) were just, was not this a time of war:
But now advice is brought that Egypt has taken up arms;
that Phœ­ nicia is conquered, and Syria is overrun :
and that that the king will be attacked even before he crosses the Euphrates:
We therefore are not alone;
but have, in our aid, as many com­ panions ;
as great a quantity of arms;
as numerous forces, and as many ships, as the Egyptian now possesses, Let us then make ufe of his troops to revenge our wrongs.
Polycharmus had not ended, when Chaereas cried aloud Away to the army!
I will take justice on my judge in the field.
If.
They then fet out with amazing fpeed after the king, as if it had been their inten­ tion to join him;
they hoping, upon that pretence, to have an opportunity of fafely crowing the Euphrates.
They got up with the army upon the banks of that river;
when mixing with thofe who had the care of the birds, birds., they went forward;
but on their arrival in Syria, deferted to the Egyptian.
They then were Seized by the centinels, who examined them strictly;
for as they had not the appearance of embassadors, they were looked upon rather as fpies:
and would cer­ tainly have been expofed to imminent danger, had not a Greek, who was there by accident, underwood their language.
They then de­ fired to be conducted to the king, as having Something to offer which would be of great Service to him.
Being introduced, Chæreas faid :
—We are Greeks, and Patricians of Sy­ racufe.
My friend here came to Babylon purely out of affection to me;
and I to feek my my wife, daughter to Hermocrates;
if thou haft ever heard of Hermocrates the Prætor, who defeated the Athenians in a naval en­ gagement.
The Egyptian faid, that he was not a Granger to this victory;
and in­ deed every nation had heard of the calamities, which the Athenians suffered, during the Si­ cilian war.
Chæreas added:
The tyrant Artaxerxes has exercifed the greater cruelty ever us:
-Saying which, they related every particular.
We therefore (continued Chæ­ reas) spontaneously devote ourselves to thee, as thy most faithful friends;
we being in­ fpired with courage from two very ftrong motives ;
a desire of death, and a thirft pf vengeance;
for as to my own sufferings, I would have left the world long fince;
and I now live only to annoy my foe.
I'llThe Egyptian was delighted with there words, when ftretching forth his hand:
Thou art come, 0 young man !
(faid he) at a happy juncture both for thyfelf, and for me.
He then inftantly gave orders that each fhould ' be provided with arms and a tent.
Not long after, he made Chæreas his gueft, and, at laft his counfellor;
as he perceived, in him, great prudence, fortitude, and fidelity;
for Chæreas was naturally of a good difpofition, and had been liberally educated.
But above all, his conteft with the king fired him, and rendered him ftill more confpicuous;
as like­ wife his ardent defire to prove himfelf a man' who who was not to be defpifed, nor ill treated with impunity;
but, on the contrary, de­ served every honour.
Accordingly Chaereas Soon performed a mighty exploit.
The Egyp­ tians had hitherto Succeeded with little dif­ ficulty on all occasions;
they, after the in­ curfion, having poffeffed themfelves of every part of Syria;
and Seized on all Phœnicia, Tyre excepted.
The Tyrians are naturally valiant, and ambitious of acquiring glory 4
In order not to appear unworthy of Hercules who is held, by them, in peculiar veneration;
they having dedicated their city almoft to him only.
The Tyrians depended likewise on the ftrength of the place, for their city was built in the midft of the ocean ;
and a narrow neck of land joining it to the conti­ nent, it was, by that'means, almoft an ifland.
This
This city lay in the form of a Chip, which coming into the harbour puts out its ladder on fhore.
Thus the Tyrians could eafily repulfe an enemy, from what quarter foever he might come:
They keeping out the land army by means of the fea (the harbour being fufficient for that purpofe;
) and the walls fe­ curing them from the attacks of the gallies or fhips;
Tyre being furrounded by vaftly ftrong fortifications, and inclofed by ports as a houfe.
III.
Thus the Tyrians, as was before ob­ served, were the only people who contemned the Egyptians;
though thefe had made a con­ queft of every other country.
This exafpe­ rating the Egyptian, he fummoned a coun­ cil of war, to which Chæreas was called, for the the firft time ;
when the former fpake thus :
Ye fee, my fellow foldiers !
(for I cannot call ye fervants,) the great ftraits we are reduced to;
we being like a fhip which, after long enjoying a profperous courfe, is, on a fud­ dcn, buffetted by contrary winds.
The ob­ ftinacy of Tyre checks our rapid progrefs ;
and we hear that the king is pufhing forward.
How then are we to act, as we cannot poffefs ourfelves of Tyre, nor advance without tak­ ing it;
fince, ftanding as a mid-wall, it fhuts us out of all Afia ?
I therefore think it ad­ vifeable, to retire from hence as fpeedily as poffible, before the Persian army fhall have joined the Tyrians;
as we otherwife fhall run the hazard, of being taken in an enemy's country.
Now Pelufium is a well fortified city, where we need not fear either the Ty- rians, nans, the Medes, or even the whole world :
as the fands
Are impaffible, and the accefs to it very narrow.
But the fea is open to us, and the Nile is a friend to the Egyptians.-
The king having ended his fpeech, thofe round him flood confounded, filent, and with forrowful countenances;
when Chæreas only dared to express his Sentiments thus O king!
(faid he) for thou art truly a king, and not him of Perfia, who of all men is the moft wicked;
thou grieved me to hear thee talk of running away in the midft of triumphs.
We fhall certainly conquer if the gods are propitious ;
and be in poffeffion, not only of Tyre, but of Babylon alfo.
Many obftacles arife in war;
yet thefe fsould not fuddenly fink our fpirits:
on the contrary, fortified by hope, we ought to put our hands vigo­ vigoroufly to the work.
Thefe very Tyrians who now deride us, will I drag along;
and lay them naked, and in- chains, at thy feet.
If thou doft not credit my words, firft fa­ crifice me, and then depart;
for while I have life, never will I fhare in thy flight.
If thou art firmly determined to go, leave me, at leaft, fome few men, who may abide of their own accord.
Polycharmus and I are ardent­ ly defirous of fighting manfully;
and came hither under the aufpices of the gods.
All were afhamed not to content to Chæreas's propofal;
when the king admiring his noble fpirit, permitted him to felect, out of the whole army, as many men as he might think proper.
Chæreas did not fet about the choice rafhly, but entering the feveral tents, he ordered Polycharmus to do the like;
and, ia in this manner he went through the whole army, to fee if there were any Greeks.
On this occasion he found many mercenaries, from among whom he drew forth only the Spar­ tans, the Corinthians, and the Peloponne­ fians.
Here he met alfo with about twenty v Sicilians.
Chæreas having then affembled a body of three hundred men, he fpake thus:
-O ye Greeks !
as the king has given.
me leave to chufe, out of his whole army, the flower of it, I have felected ye:
for I myfelf am a Greek, a Syracufian, and ori­ ginally from Doris.
Ye therefore muff fur­ pars the Barbarians, not only in fplendor of birth, but likewife in valour.
Let none of ye then dread the attempt to which I call ye forth;
for it will not be found above human ftrength, nor perplexed with difficulties;
thefe there being greater in imagination, than in execution.
As fmall a number of Greeks withflood Xerxes at Thermopylae Now the Tyrians are not five millions.
On the con­ trary, they are few ;
very vain ;
defpifers of their enemies;
and ftrangers to greatness of foul, or wifdom in council.
Let them then know, how vaftly fuperior the Greeks are to the Tyrians.
However, I am not ambitious of being your general;
but ready to follow him, among ye, who will chufe to bead the enterprize ;
and fuch fhall find me obedient;
I feeking not my own glory, but that of my country.
-Immediately all cried aloud:
— Be thou our captain !-
Whereupon Chæreas faid :
Ye have bellowed on me the fu­ preme command :
be then allured, that I will endeavour fo to conduct myfelf, as not to give give ye caufe to repent of your kindnefs, nor of your confidence in chufing me your leader.
Ye now, by the favour of the gods, will all acquire more wealth, and greater ho­ nour, than your fellow-foldiers;
your names will be immortal;
and all nations will, to la­ ten:
pofterity, celebrate the three hundred who followed Chæreas, in like manner as the foldiers headed by Miltiades;
and the three hundred who fought under Leonidas.-
Chæreas had not done Speaking, when all cried aloud:
Lead on !
And inftantly all flew to arms.
IV.
Chæreas having clad them in Splendid armour, and furnished them with weapons of every kind, led them to the royal tent.
The king was all aftonifhment at the light;
and could could not believe them to be the fame men ;
when promifing them noble rewards:
Of this, (faid Chæreas) we have not the leaft doubt.
In the mean time do thou keep the reft of the forces under arms ;
and draw not near Tyre, till we fhall have made ourfelves mafters of it, and call out to ye, from the walls.
—May the Gods grant (faid the king) that this come to pafs.
-Chæreas now drew up his men clofe together, in order that they might appear much fewer in number;
whenHe then marched them towards Tyre, unfeen at firft by the enemy.
Approaching ftill nearer, and being at laft fpied by the centi­ nels on the walls ;
thefe gave notice to the.
town, that a body of men was advancing, but but without the lean fufpicion of their being foes.
Who indeed could furmife, that fuch a handful of men would have presumed to advance againft a moft powerful city, which the whole Egyptian army dared not to be­ fiege ?
Being by this time come near to the walls, the Tyrians afked who they were, and what they wanted ?
-Chæreas replied
We are Grecian mercenaries, who, have not only been refused our pay by the king of, Egypt, but even run the hazard of being deftroyed by his machinations :
and we appear here in order to take vengeance, in con­ junction with you, of our common foe.
Thefe words being reported to the people within the walls, the gates were opened;
when the governor coming forth with only a few a few men ;
Chæreas firft flew him, and then ran to the reft, whenThey now killed one another, like as when lions fall upon a herd of oxen, whofe keeper is not with them.
Inftantly the city echoed with fhrieks and lamentations;
for few could be eye-witneffes to the prodigious havock then making, and all were in the utmoft confufion ;
the rabble poured tumultuoufly through the gates, in order to fee what was doing ;
doing;
and to this was principally owing the lots of Tyre :
for thofe in the city ftruggled with all their might to get out;
while fuch as were out of it, being cut with fabres, and pierced by fpears, made as violent efforts to force in.
Meeting thus, and running againft one another, they fell an eafy prey to the de­ ftructive fword;
and fuch heaps of dead bodies lay before the gates, that it was not poffible to lhut them.
In this inexpreffible confufion, Chæreas only retained his pretence of mind and judgment;
when forcing his way through all oppofition, he got within the gates.
And now himfelf and nine more afcended the walls, whence he called to the Egyptians, who immediately rufhing forward, the city was taken.
The Egyptians being thus matters of Tyre, were all joy and fefti­ vity.
vity.
But Chæreas would neither offer up facrifices nor put on a crown;
he faying:
-
To what purpofe fhould I appear with any infignia of victory, if thou (0 Callirrhoe!) doft not fee them ?
Never fince our bridal night have I wore a crown ;
for fhouldeft.
thou be dead, it would be impious in me to rejoice.
On the other hand, fhouldeft thou be living, how could I mix in feaftings with­ out thee, who, poffibly art now furrounded with a thousand evils?
During this in­ terval, the king of Perfia, having croft the Euphrates, marched forward with all poffible fpeed, in order to fight the enemy.
For hav­ ing received advice that Tyre was taken, he was afraid for Sidon and all Syria;
as he found that the enemy would oppofe him with equal numbers.
Hence he thought it moft prudent prudent to march without his baggage, or other impediment ;
as he fhould thereby ad­ vance much fwifter, and have nothing to check him in his career.
Hereupon felecting the flower of his army, he left, in the place where he then was, all fuch men as were not of age to bear arms ;
as likewise the queen, with the treafures, the rich veftments and royal equipages.
Artaxerxes reflecting after­ wards, that tumult and confufion reigned univerfally, by means of the war;
and that this had fpread even to the cities near the Euphrates;
he therefore thought it were fafeft to lodge, in Aradus, every thing he might now leave behind him.
V.
This ifland is thirty furlongs from the continent ;
and in it ftands an antient temple facred facred to Venus.
Here the women were free and fafe as in their owa houfes.
Cal­ lirrhoe
Spying the Goddefs, who flood oppo­ fite to her;
the at firft continued filent:
then weeping, reproached Venus with being the caufe of her tears;
and, at laft, thus whifpered to herfelf—
Behold me now in Aradus, a fmall ifland, in ex­ change for the wide-extended Sicily;
and without a fingle relation or friend.
This furely is enough, 0 Goddess!
How much longer wilt thou persecute me?
If I have highly offended thee, thou muft have chat.
tiled me fufficiently.
Should .
my ill-fated beauty have juftly excited envy, confider that it has proved my ruin.
I alto have felt the horrors of war, which alone were wanting to complete my fufferings.
Babylon, in com- parifon parifon of my present evils, has treated me with lenity.
There Chæreas was near to me;
but he furely is now no more ;
for methinks he could not live, after my departure from that city.
But of whom can I enquire what is become of him ?
All I here behold are ftrangers and Barbarians;
perfons who envy and hate me;
or, what is ftill worfe, who love me.
Do thou then (0 Goddefs inform me, whether Chæreas be ftill living.
Cal­ lirrhoe, after faying thefe words, left the temple, when fhe met on a fudden Rhodo­ gune, daughter to Zopyrus and wife to Me­ gabyfus ;
both men of the higheft rank among the Perfians;
the firft lady of that na­ tion, who went to meet Callirrhoe when the entered Babylon *.
The Egyptian hearing that that Artaxerxes was near, and had made mighty preparations both by fea and land, fent for Chæreas and fpake thus:
I have not yet had an opportunity of rewarding thee, with due honour, for thy firft magnanimous ex­ plaits.
Thou haft put Tyre into my hands.
With regard to the future, let us not lofe the conquers which now offer themselves , and thefe I will fhare with thee.
Egypt will be a Efficient empire for me, and Syria fhall be thine.
Let us now confider what is to be done, for the war rages both by fea and land.
I leave it to thy option, either to head the army, or the fleet.
However, I imagine that the ocean is more naturally thy element, as the Sy­ racufians defeated the Athenians in a naval engagement.
Thou now mull fight againft the Perfians, who were defeated by the Athenians.
Thou
Thou wilt command the Egyptian gallies, which are larger, and more in number, than thofe of Sicily.
Do thou then imitate, in this expedition, the glorious example fet thee by Hermocrates thy father-in-law.
-—Dangers of every kind (faid Chæreas) will be pleating to me.
For thy fake I undertook to wage war with the king of Perfia, whom I mor­ tally hate.
Give me only, with the fleet of gallies, my three hundred men.
- Takq thofe, (replied the Egyptian) and as many more as thou mayeft want.
This was put in execution forthwith, as matters preyed exceedingly.
And now the Egyptian, head­ log the land forces, marched againft the enemy;
and Chæreas was appointed admiraL
This firft ftep difheartened infinitely the foldiers, as Chæreas, their favourite, was not DOt to command them;
for, led on by him, they never doubted of victory.
This was in fome meafure like plucking out an eye from a huge body.
On the contrary, thofe on board the fleet were infpired with frefh hopes and greater courage;
as they were to be headed by fo brave, fo excellent a com­ mander.
And now all the fea-captains, the pilots, the mariners, and the foldiers, fo far from loitering, were inftantly rouzed and in action;
each being eager to fet the example, and to fhow how ready he was to obey Chæ­ reas, and to give him the moft fignal proofs valour.
The battles were fought, on one and the fame day, both by fea and land.
On this occafion the Egyptian infantry long refifted the Medes and Perfians.
but being at at laft overpowered by numbers, they were forced to yield.
Artaxerxes purfued them with his cavalry;
when equal was the ftrug­ gle :
the king of Egypt endeavouring to get into Pelufium, and the Perfian monarch to intercept him in his flight.
The Egyptian would perhaps have efcaped, had not Dio­ nyfius firft routed all who oppofed him ;
he fighting valiantly near the king, in order to be feen by him;
and he performed wonders during the whole engagement.
As the pur­ fuit of the enemy was tedious, and continued day and night;
Dionyfius obferving that this troubled the king, fpake thus:
Do not (my Liege!) perplex thyfelf, for I will pre­ vent the Egyptian from efcaping, provided thou thou wilt lend me a body of chofen cavaf­ ry.
The king applauded his fpirit, and gave him five thousand horfe.
Dionyfius then marched, in one day, the number -of miles ufually rode in two:
when falling un­ expectedly on the enemy, in the night, he took a great number of them alive;
flew many more;
and routed their whole army.
The Egyptian being feized alive, laid violent hands an himfelf;
when Dionyfius carried his head to the king, who, at the fight of it, cried :
Thou fhalt be recorded in the royal annals, as a benefactor to myhoufe;
and I now beftow on thee a gift, which, of all things, thou moft defireft, Thy wife Callirrhoe.
The war has decided.
the law- fuit :
fuit:
and thou wilt now receive the moft beautiful reward for thy valour.
Diony­ flus fell proftrate, and imagined himfelf equal to the gods;
being firmly perfuadcd, that he fhould henceforward continue the huf­ band of Callirrhoe, and be never more fepa­ sated from her.
VI.
Such were the tranfactions on land:
but Chæreas won a complete victory at fea ;
his enemies not daring to come out, and face him with equal numbers:
They not coding the attack of the Egyptian gallies, nor once turning their prows towards them;
but part fled with all the fail they could croud;
and part, running afhore, the crews fell tell into the hands of Chæreas;
and tht ocean was covered with the wrecks of the Median veflels.
Artaxerxes knew not that his fleet was overcome;
nor did Chæreas hear that the Egyptian army had been defeated;
on the contrary, both thought themselves victors by fea and land.
The fame day that the battle was fought, Chæreas coming off Aradus with his fleet, ordered his ships to furround the island;
and to keep fo sharp a look-out, as might enable them to give a good account, to their commander, of all that past.
Accordingly, those who had re­ ceived there orders, drove the eunuchs, the women-Haves, and all the populace into a spacious square or market-place;
on which oc­ occasion the multitude was To great, that part were forced to pars the night under porticos, and part in the open air.
Thofe of fome rank were led to the town-house, where the Archontes, or chief magnates, ufed to af­ femble, and transact the business of the state.
The women fat on the earth round the queen ;
they having neither lighted up fires, nor re­ ceived any sustenance;
being fully perfuaded that the king was taken prifoner;
that the Persians were totally undone;
and that the Egyptian had conquered every where.
This was a night, in Aradus, of the greater joy to fome, and of the deepeR:
affliction to others:
The Egyptians, on the one hand, being delighted that the war was at an end, and themselves freed from Persian flavery:
vhile, while, on the other hand, the Persian cap­ fives exposed nothing but chains, outrages, Scourges, slaughter;
or, as the mildest pu­ nishment, flavery.
Statira, laying her head on Callirrhoe's knees, wept.
The latter being a Greek, having had a generous education, and been long conversant with adverfity, greatly comforted the queen.
Now it happened, at this juncture, that an Egyptian foldier, who flood guard over fuch as were confined in the town-house, knowing that the queen was there;
he, struck with the awe which all the Barbarians naturally feel, on hearing the royal name pronounced, dared not to approach Statira;
but standing at the door, which was fhut, he fpake thus to Callirrhoe:
——0 Lady!
be not dejected, for for the admiral knows not that thou art dixit up here with the other captives;
but when this shall be told him, he will treat thee with the ut most humanity, and take all Imaginable care of thee.
He is not only brave, but na­ turally a lover of thy sex, and will make thee his wife.
——Callirrhoe, at thefe words, vent­ ed a deep figh;
and tearing her hair, burst into the following exclamation:
—— I now am a slave indeed 1 0 strike a poniard to my heart, rather than bring me rach tidings!
I cannot hear of marriage, and only with for death.
Let them murther me, let them conTume me to ashes, I will not flir from hence.
This fpot shall be my grave.
If thy chiestain, (as thon fayest) is of a benign and generous temper, let him grant me one boon ;
beon ;
I mean, put an end to my life here.—
The soldier renewed his in treaties, yet Cal­ lirrhoe would not rife from the earth, but lay with her head covered.
Hereupon the Egyptian began to confider how he should act ;
he not daring to employ force, nor was he master of eloquence fufficient to win her.
He then returned with a dejected count.. nance to Chæreas, who fpake thus:
— What can all this mean ?
I am robbed of the most precious part of my booty;
but I will take vengeance on thofe who have done this.
—
—The soldier replied :
——My Lord !
no iniquity has been practised on this occa­ sion:
but the woman whom I found extended in the market place, refuses to let me bring her to thee.
On the contrary, she is still lying prostrete, and calling out for a fword, wishes wishes to die.
Chærcas fmiling, cried:
— 0 thou most ignorant of mortals!
knowest thou not the arts by which a woman is won ?
by foothing, by flattery, by promises ;
and above all, by making her fancy that she is be­ loved.
Thou perhaps mayeft have ufed vio­ lence or opprobrious language :
——In no manner, (answered the foldier:
)
On the contrary, I have not only done all that thou haft now mentioned, but even twice as much.
I have invented a falsity with regard to thee, by laying that thou wouldeft marry her, at which the deemed moPe offended.
—I furely, (faid Chæreas) mull be vastly handfome and engaging, fince this captive declares an a- verfion, though she never faw me.
Be this as it will, she feems of a generous spirit.
Let no one therefore presume to employ force;
force;
but leave her to act as she may think proper.
It is incumbent on me to revere and protect virtue.
Perhaps this woman may bewail a loft hufband.
END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.
THEI.
I T has been related, in the preceeding book, how Chæreas, fuspecting that Callirrhoe had been decreed to Dionyfius, was fired with revenge, and revolted to the Egyptian;
who appointing him admiral, he won won the empire of the sea :
and how Chæ­ reas, thus victorious, seized upon Aradus, where Artaxerxes had left his contort, his retinue, and Callirrhoe.
Fortune was now preparing an incident which was Scarce cre­ dible, and of a forrowful call:
viz.
Chæ­ reas, though possessed of Callirrhoe, yet knew not that she was in his hands;
and having taken the wives of other men on board, he was failing away with them ;
while he left his own in Aradus;
not as Bacchus abandoned his wife Ariadne when asleep ;
but as a prey to his enemies.
Hereupon Ve­ nus, difpleafed at fo unnatural an event, re­ folved to unravel and clear up the whole.
For the now began to be reconciled to Chæ­ reas, with whom she before had been offend­ ed, on account of his violent jealoufy, and his his ingratitude to her;
after the had beftow­ ed, on him, a moft beautiful gift;
a gift more precious than that which Alexander, called Paris, bore away.
And now Chæreas, having fettled all matters with Cupid, and made full satisfaction to that God, by having been long toft, from Weft to East, and exposed to numberlefs disasters :
Venus took pity on the wanderer;
and determined to reftore, at last, to each other, a most exquifitely-beau­ tiful pair, whom she firft joined;
and who had undergone a vaft variety of sufferings, both by fea and land.
—I am of opinion, that this laft book will be highly entertaining to my readers;
and expiate, as it were, for all the mournful incidents in the former ones.
Robbers, slavery, trials, contests, fixed re­ folutions to die;
war, and captivity, will be told told no more -. but chafte loves, and lawful nuptials, be the subjects of the following book.
I shall now declare, in what manner Venus threw light over this obscure' affair;
and how Chæreas and Callirrhoe, not knowing each other, were, by means of that goddefs, reciprocally restored.—
It was evening, and many slaves were yet to be put on board the gallies.
Chæreas, who was greatly fatigued, now rote up, to order and prepare the de­ parture of his fleet.
As he was palling through the market place, the Egyptian said to him :
——Here (my Lord !) is the woman, who will not go on board, and obfiinately refolves to starve herself.
But thou wilt (perhaps) be able to perfuade her to rife ;
for why leave behind thee the moll:
lovely part of thy fpoils ?
Polycharmus Second­ ed ed this hint, he being vastly defirous of en­ gaging Chæreas, if poffible, in a new amour ;
to console him for the lots of Callirrhoe :
upon which Polycharmus faid :
—Chæreas !—
Let us go in.
Having paft the threshold, and feeing the woman Wretched on the ground, with her head covered ;
Chæreas im­ mediately, from her breathing and the form of her body, found himself greatly agitated, and in fufpence;
and would certainly have then known again Callirrhoe, had he not been firmly perfuaded, that she was gone away with Dionysius.
Hereupon approaching very foftly :
Woman !
(faid he) whoever thou art, be comforted, for no violence shall be offered thee;
and thou shalt possess the husband whom thou coveted.
At. there words, Callirrhoe, hearing his well-known voice, voice, threw off her veil, and both cried aloud:
CHÆREAS !—CALLIRRHOE !— when fondly clafping each other, they faint­ ed, and fell on the ground.
Polycharmus, at fo wonderful and unexpected an event, was at first struck dumb;
but fpake as fol­ lows, a little after.
Rife!
rife !
Ye now are mutually restored.
The gods have in­ dulged the ardent wishes of both.
However, confider that ye are not in your native isle, but in an enemy's country:
and that it will be necessary ye
Should now fettle every thing upon fo folid a footing, as may prevent any future separation—Polycharmus pronounced there words aloud :
but the transported pair heard them imperfectly;
as persons, at the bottom of a well, would a voice coming from above.
It was with great difficulty they re­ covered covered from their extafy ;
when fondly gaz­ ing on each other, they repeated their kisses, and again swooned away.
This they did a fecond, and a third time, saying only :
-Do I certainly fold thee ?
Art thou, indeed, Cal­ lirrhoe ?
-Art thou really Chæreas?
Intently fame published, that the admiral had recovered his contort.
And now, not a foldier continued in his tent;
not a mariner on board his galley;
nor a porter, or feryant, at a door;
but the people flocked from all parts, crying aloud :
Thrice happy fair ! to have thus found again her exquisitely­ beautiful husband.——
Yet the moment Cal­ lirrhoe appeared, praifes were no longer be­ stowed on Chæreas ;
but every eye gazed at her, as though file only had been present.
Callinhoe now walked, with an air of ma­ jesty, jelly, between Chæreas and Polycharmus.
Flowers and chaplets were Scattered over them;
and ointments, with wine, poured forth at their feet.
On this occasion were united the two moft delightful articles, in peace and war, viz. triumphs for victory, and rejoicings for marriage.
It had been Chæreas's custom, always to lie on board his ship ;
and to fpend the greater part of the night, as well as the day, in a variety of oc­ cupations :
but now, leaving all things to Polycharmus, he, without waiting for night, entered the royal bed chamber:
for in every city a palace is appropriated to the king.
Here flood a golden bed, whore coverlet was of Tyrian purple, of Babylonish workman­ ship.
But O! what pen could describe the night in which our blifsful pair related their respective respective adventures;
intermixing them with floods of tears, and numberlefs kisses !
Callirrhoe began first, by telling him how fhe recovered from her trance in the Maufo­ leum, and was afterwards taken from thence by Theron.
She alfo related her voyage, and how she had been fold.
—Hitherto Chæ­ reas had fhed tears while he listened to her story ;
but when she fpake of Miletus, she, through modefty, was fient :
upon which, he, excited by his natural jealoufy, grew un­ easy ;
but the relation she gave of her fon, foothed and confoled him.
Hereupon Chæreas, before she had ended, fpake thus:
- By what accident cameft thou to Aradus ?
Where didft thou leave Dionyfius ?
and what past between thee, and the king !
—
Instant­ ly Callirrhoe declared, with an oath, that fhe had had not once let eyes on Dionyfius, fince the trial:
and that Artaxerxes certainly loved her, but that he had never offered fo much as to kits her.
——I then, (continued Chæ­ reas) have been very unjuft, and too preci­ pitate in my anger;
in bringing fo many evils upon the king, fince he never injured thee.
When tome from thee, I was forced to de­ fert;
yet have I not done any thing, fince that time, unworthy of Caliirrhoe;
I having filled both the land and fea with my trophies.
-He then told her all his actions minutely ;
and deemed not a little delighted, while re­ lating his his own heroic achievements. ——
After Satiating themfelves with tears, and the relation of their refpective adventures,If.
ItII.
It was yet night, when an Egyptian, of.
fome rank, arrived in a pinnace;
and land­ ing, cried haftily, and in fome confufion:
-
Where is Chæreas? ——
Being introduced to Polycharmus, the ftranger faid, that he had a fecret to communicate to Chæreas only;
and that the bufinefs he was come upon, was vaftly urgent, and, required the quickeft dif­ patch.
—Polycharmus did not go in to Chæ­ reas for a long time, he being unwilling to difturb him unfeafonably.
But the Egyptian growing more importunate;
Polycharmus, opening the bed chamber door a little, told Chaereas, that a perfon was come upon an affair of infinite importance.
Immediately Chæreas, like an able captain, faid:
— — Bring in the man ;
for war admits of.
no de­ lay. —
The Egyptian being introduced, in the the dead of night, and landing by Chæreas's bed-fide:
Know, (faid he) that the king of Perfia has flain him of Egypt;
and or­ dered part of his army to march for that country, to fettle matters there;
while him­ felf is advancing, with the remainder of his forces, and will be here in a very fhort time.
Fbr hearing that Aradus was taken, he la­ ments the lofs of the vaft treafures left by him therein ;
but is efpecially grieved, on account of his contort, Statira.—
—At thefe words Chæreas carted from his bed, when Callirrhoe, holding him, cried :
—Whither doft thou run, without firft deliberating on the prefent flate of affairs ?
for fhouldeft thou fpread abroad this news, thou wilt kindle a mighty war againft thy felf.
All who hear this will contemn thee ;
and we, being again made made captives, shall fuffer far greater cala­ mities than before.
——Chæreas complied in­ stantly with her counsel ;
when coming out of the bed-chamber, he artfully took the Egyptian by the hand :
then calling his peo­ ple round him, he said :
—
O my friends !
we likewife have overcome the king of Perfia's land forces.
The man who now stands be­ fore ye, has brought this joyful news, toge­ ther with letters from the Egyptian monarch.
It is therefore our duty to fail, with all pof­ fible expedition, to the rendezvous he ap­ pointed.
Be then the baggage got together, and let all haflen to their respective gallies.—
The Infant thefe words were uttered, the trumpet founded for every one to go on board.
All the booty, with the flaves, had been fhipt the day before;
and nothing was then then left in the island, except fuch things as were too heavy to be transported, or altoge­ ther ufelefs.
They then unfurled the fails, and weighed anchor, when the harbour echo­ ed with tumult and confufion ;
and all were varioufly employed.
Chæreas, now coming on board, gave private orders for failing to­ wards Cyprus;
as though it would be ne­ cessary to take possession of that island, then in a defenceless condition.
The wind being favourable, they Coon reached Paphos, where flood a temple facred to Venus.
Chaereas, before they landed, tent cryers on shore, to offer to the inhabitants peace and amity;
which being accepted, Chæreas ordered the crews of the Several gallies to land ;
when, after bellowing rich gifts on Venus, and getting together a great many victims, he en­ tertained tertained the whole fleet at a Splendid ban­ quet.
Chaereas, confidering afterwards how he should act ;
the prices and footh-fayers informed him, that the victims were propi­ tious.
Animated by this declaration, he af­ fembled the captains of the ships ;
his three hundred Greeks ;
and all the Egyptians whom he knew to be in his intereft, when he fpake thus:
—My fellow - foldiers !
my companions in mighty exploits, fo glorious to us all!
Joined with you, we could either make peace with honour, or continue the war with fafety.
Experience has taught us, that we, by means of the concord which has subsisted fo happily between us, are become matters of the fea :
But things are on fuch a footing, at this junc­ ture, that it will be incumbent on us to con­ full immediately together, and provide for our our future fecurity.
Know then, that the Egyp­ tian was slain in battle;
and that the king of Perfia has Seized upon all the continent;
fo that we are now Surrounded with enemies.
Is then any one among you of opinion, that we should go to the king, and spontaneously deliver up ourfelves into his hands ?
Im­ mediately they all, as with one voice, cried aloud :
——We will submit to any thing rather than do this.
Whither then shall we efcape, thus encompassed by foes ?
and it will not be possible for us to By to the skies.—
At there words, all were silent, when a La­ cedæmonian, cousin to Brasidas, whom dire necessity had compelled, in dangerous times, to leave his native country, was the first who dared to fpeak:
Why (fays he,) do we endeavour to By from the king, while the fea fea is open to us, and we are possessed of Clips ?
Both of thefe will convey us to Sicily, and to Syracufe;
where we stand not in fear either of the Persian or the Athenians ?
—All applauded this advice, Chæreas excepted, who pretended not to approve of it, by ob­ serving, that it would be too long a voyage ;
though, in reality, he spake thus merely to found them ;
and to know whether they had declared their real fentiments.
However, as they all grew exceedingly pressing, and were eager to fet fail instantly, Chæreas faid:
O Greeks !
ye have taken an ex­ cellent resolution, and I return you many thanks, for the testimonies given me of your good-will and fidelity;
and rest assured, that ye shall not repent of this, if the gods favour our deigns.
But the Egyptians, of whom there are vaft numbers, mull not be forced contrary to their will ;
as moft of them have wives and children, from whom they would not willingly be feparated.
Let then fome go and enquire, among the multitude, the fen­ timent of each man in particular:
in order that we may take with us none but volun­ teers.
—All the commands of Chæreas were forthwith put in execution.
III.
Now Callirrhoe, taking Chæreas by the hand, and drawing him afide, faid :
What are thy intentions
Wilt thou take Statira, and the beauteous Rhodogune, with thee to Syracufe ?
This question raised a blush in Chæreas's cheek, when he replied:
— It is not for my own fake that I shall con­ vey thefe women thither, but in order that they they may be thy slaves.
Immediately Cal­ lirrhoe cried aloud:
The gods forbid, that I fhould ever be fo mad, as to permit the queen of Alia to be my slave ;
especially as her perfon is, by the laws of hospitality, facred to me!
If therefore thou wouldeft oblige me, fend her back to the king;
since the treated me, while under her care, with as much kindnefs as if I had been her bro­ ther's wife.
Thou couldest not form a with, (anfwered Chæreas) which I would not indulge.
Thou art mistress of Statira;
of my fpoils;
but, above all things, of my foul.
Callirrhoe, overjoyed at this reply, kissed her hufband ;
and immediately ordered the officers to conduct her to Statira, who, with the most noble Persian ladies, was shut up in a cabin, quite ignorant of all that had passed ;
parted;
and not even knowing that Callirrhoe was reflored to her darling Chæreas;
the queen being so Wrongly guarded that no one could approach, or fee her;
or even give her the leaft information of any thing.
So foon as Callirrhoe entered the ship, attended by the captain, amazement feized the people, who ran up and down in confufion;
when one whimpered another, faying:
The ad­ miral's lady is coming.
Statira perceiving this, vented a deep figh, and weeping, cried O fortune !
Thou haft preserved me till this day, that I, a queen, might behold my mi­ stress;
who, possibly, is now come on board, merely to fee what kind of nave the has got.
The other women now broke forth into lamentations;
on which occafion she learnt how dreadful flavery is to noble, free- born born minds.
But God changed, on a fud­ den, the face of things;
for Callirrhoe, being still on board, flew to Statira, and em­ bracing her affectionately, faid :
Hail 0 Queen !
for a queen thou art, and a queen thou fhalt ever remain.
Thou art not fallen into the hands of an enemy, but of one who loves thee exceedingly ;
and has re­ ceived the strongest marks of thy benevo­ lence.
My Chæreas is admiral;
an honour to which his anger againft the great king raised him, for his not restoring me imme­ diately.
But his animosity being now fubfided, he is reconciled, and no longer thy foe.
Rife therefore (excellent Statira !) depart chear­ fully, and do thou alfo recover thy consort;
for the king liveth, and Chæreas will fend thee to him.
Rife albo, Rhodogune!
my first first friend among the Persians, and go to thy hufband;
with as many more women as the queen shall defire:
and remember Callir­ rhoe.
Statira, at there words, was all astonishment;
not knowing whether the ought to give credit to, or difbelieve, what she heard.
However, fuch was the rectitude of Callirrhoe's heart, that she never jelled in matters of consequence;
and the present crifis required the utmoft difpatch in all things.
There was then, among the Egyptians, a philosopher, Demetrius by name, who was well-known to the king ;
a man advanced in years;
and excelling all his countrymen, in learning and the study of virtue.
Chæreas calling him, fpake thus:
I intended to have taken thee with me;
but I now will en­ trust thee with a very important commiffion;
I mean, I mean, thou shalt conduct the royal consort to the great king.
Hereby thou wilt ingratiate thyfelf Rill more with the monarch, and re­ store the rest to his favour.
Having fail thefe words, he appointed Demetrius com­ mander of the ships or gallies which were to return home ;
for all would follow Chæreas ;
they preferring him to their native country, and to their children.
However, he only chore twenty of the bell:
and largest gallies ;
as he deigned to crofs the Ionian fea.
On board of there he fhipt all the Greeks who were then with him :
as likewise fuch Egyp­ tians, and Phœnicians, as he knew were brave and vigorous.
Many Cyprians went voluntarily aboard on this occafion.
Chæreas rent all the rest to their homes, each with his portion of the enemies spoils;
fo that they all all returned joyfully to their respective coun­ tries, loaded with rewards and honours;
and no one who asked Chæreas a favour was refuted it, Callirrhoe carried, to Statira, all the rich vestments and the royal female or­ naments.
But the would not accept of any of them, faying:
Callirrhoe !
do thou be decked with them, for thy inchant­ ing frame claims princely attire.
It is alfo re­ quifite, that thou do have wherewithal to be­ flow on thy mother, and to prefent to the Deities of thy country.
I have left many more things of this fort in Babylon.
May the Gods grant thee a profperous voyage, and land thee in Safety ;
and mayest thou never, never more be feparated from thy Chæreas !
Thou haft acted with the strictest justice, to­ wards me, in all things:
and proved that thy thy foul is as excellent as thy form is beauti­ ful.
The king, in giving thee in charge to me, depofited an invaluable treafure.
IV.
Who could relate the very numerous, and very different tranfactions of that day ?
Some were offering up vows, and others bid­ ding farewell:
Some were elated with joy;
and others plunged in forrow:
Many were giving commiffions reciprocally;
and many writing to their families and friends.
Chæ­ reas, among the rest, wrote a letter to the king, in the following terms:
——Thou waft meditating the trial of my caufe, and I have gained it by the decifion of a moft up­ right judge;
for war is an excellent arbiter both of right and wrong *.
War has given me me not only my own wife Callirrhoe, but thine also.
I have not imitated thy dilatory conduct, but instantly, and without thy de­ firing it, now restore to thee Statira inviolate;
and a queen, even in captivity.
However, know that it is not me, but Callirrhoe, who fends thee this gift;
in return for which, we request of thee to be reconciled to the Egyp­ tians;
it being the duty of all men, and ef­ \ pecially.
of kings, to prevent evil *.
Thou wilt have Soldiers who love their fovereign;
they chusing to flay with thee, rather than as friends, to follow me.
Thus did Chæ­ reas write.
Callirrhoe alfo thought it in­ cumbent on her to return thanks to Diony­ Sius.
That was the only thing the concealed from from Chæreas;
for, knowing his jealous temper, she kept this a fecret;
and wrote to Dionyfius in manner following :
——Cattirrhoe to Dio­ nyfius, her patron and benefactor, greeting.
Thou didft deliver me out of the hands of robbers, and from slavery.
Be not incenfed against me, I beseech thee, for my heart is with thee, on account of our mutual son, whom I earneftly recommend to thy generous care;
requesting that he be nurtured and educated in a manner worthy of us.
May he never be subject to a ftep-mother !
Thou haft not only a son, but a daughter albo.
Two children are fufficient for thee.
Marry thy fon when come to man's estate;
and fend him to Syracuse, that he may fec his grand-fire.—
Plangon, I greet thee.
I wrote this with my own hand.
May health attend thee, (good (good Dionyfius !) and blot not Callirrhoe from thy remembrance.
Having healed the letter, fhe hid it in her bofom, and when the departure was near, and all were going on board;
Callirrhoe, taking Statira by the hand, conduced her to the fhip;
where De­ metrius had fet up a royal pavillion;
with fails of Babylonilh purple, interwove with gold.
Callirrhoe, with the fondeft caresses, laid the queen on the bed, and fpake thus:
— Adieu, O Statira!
preferve me tenderly in thy memory, and write to me often at Syra­ cufe.
Every thing is eafy to the king of per­ fia.
I will make due acknowledgments, for that kindness, to my parents, and to the gods of Greece.
To thee I recommend ray fon, whom thou didft ufe to fee with plea­ sure.
Look on him as a trust depofited, by me, me, in thy hands.
At thefe words Cal­ lirrhoe shed a flood of tears, and the women burft into wailings.
And now Cailirrhoe leaving the ship, bowed to Statira ;
and blush­ ing, delivered her the letter, faying:
—— Give this to the hapless Dionyfius, whom I earneftly recommend to thee, and to the king.
Confole him, I befeech thee;
for I am afraid he will lay violent hands on him­ self, when Separated from me.
The ,o- men would probably have talked much longer together;
have broke again into lamentations, and kissed each other;
had not the pilots given notice, that they were going to leave the harbour.
Callirrhoe, the moment before she went on board, adored Venus, saying:
— Thanks to thee (0 Goddefs!) for the good I now enjoy.
Thou art reconciled to me at last.
last.
Grant me then to fee again my native Syracufe.
A vast sea lies between, and tremen­ dous waters are ready to receive me;
yet shall I not be under the leaft apprehenfions, if thou but bear me company in the voyage.—
Not a single Egyptian went on board Deme­ trius's ship, without firft taking leave of Chae­ reas, and kiffing his head and hand;
his amiable conduct having won him universal love.
Chæreas permitted this fleet to fail out first;
when praifes, intermixed with kind wishes, echoed through the wide-extended ocean.
Thus did thefe proceed on their voyage.
V.
And now the Perfian monarch, having triumphed over his enemies, had fent a per­ son into Egypt, to fettle his affairs in that king­ kingdom;
whilft himfelf hasted to Aradus, where his conCoct had been left.
But being arrived near Chius and Tyre, and offering sacrifices to Hercules for the conquers at­ chieved by him;
a courier brought advice, that the Egyptian ships had sacked Aradus, and left nothing upon that island.
To this the courier added a most forrowful piece of news, viz. that the queen was no more.
—On this occasion the Perfian lords, upon pretence of weeping for Statira, bewailed the death of their respective relations or friends;
one hav­ ing lost his wife, another his lifter, a third his daughter;
and everyone fome kinfman, or perfon dear to him.
After the Egyptian fleet had left Aradus, it was not known to which fea it was bound ;
when it happen­ ed that the Perfians fpied, the day following, some tome Egyptian lips, whofe course was doubt­ ful, bearing down upon them.
The Per­ fians were furprized at the fight, and knew not what to make of it;
but were much more astonished, when they perceived the royal standard flying in Demetrius's ship;
a thing never feen except when the king is on board.
This caufed a noife and confufion as though an enemy had been near;
when they went instantly to Artaxerxes, and cried thus:
Perhaps another king of Egypt may have rifen up !
—Artaxerxes descended hastily from his throne ;
and running to the sea-shore, made the signal for battle.
The king, as there were no ships at hand, drew up fuch forces as were ready armed in the harbour.
By this time fome had bent the bow, while others were going to hurl the fpear;
fpear;
which Demetrius obferving, he gave notice thereof to the queen, who coming forth from under the pavillion, and shewing herfelf to the multitude;
they immediately threw down their arms, and fell prostrate before her.
The king could not contain himfelf;
but leaping first into the ship, before it was come clofe to the shore, he clafped his confort with the utmost fondnefs;
and shedding tears of joy, cried :
——Dearest wife !
what gracious Deity has restored thee, at last, to my longing arms ?
That my queen should be lost, and afterwards recovered, ap­ pears equally incredible.
By what magic is it that I, who left thee on shore, now find . thee at sea ? ——
Statira replied :
Thou receivest me, as a gift, from Callirrhoe.
Artaxerxes, at this name, felt his former wound wound bleed afrefh;
when directing his eyes to the eunuch Artaxates:
—— Conduct me (faid he) to Callirrhoe, that I may thank her sor this kind act.
—The queen anfwercd ;
— I will tell thee every thing;
faying which, they walked together from the harbour to the palace.
There Statira, having command­ ed every one, (the eunuch excepted,) to withdraw ;
the related all that had pail in Aradus, and in Cyprus;
and, at last, de­ livered Chæreas's letter to the king, who, after reading it, found himfelf agitated by numberlefs paffions.
He was exasperated that thofe he held moft dear had been made captives:
He was forry, that himfelf had forced Chaereas to desert from his Service;
and yet he thought himfelf obliged to Chæ­ reas, for having taken Callirrhoe for ever from from his sight.
But, of all the passions, envy tortured him most, he crying:
Thrice happy Chæreas, and much more fortunate than me!
—After they had talked over every thing, Statira desired the king to com­ fort Dionyfius:
she observing, that this was Callirrhoe's requeft.
Hereupon Artaxerxes, turning to the eunuch:
Let Dionyfius (said the monarch ;
) come in.
And now the Ionian, elated with the most fanguine hopes, instantly obeyed the royal Summons;
he being totally ignorant of the victories won by Chæreas ;
imagining that Callirrhoe was with the other women ;
and that he was fent for, by the king, in order for her to be restored to him, as a reward for his important services.
Dionyfius was no fooner introduced, than Artaxerxes related to him every every particular.
On this occasion the Ionian Showed uncommon wifdom, and fortitude of mind:
and, like one who should Hand un­ moved, when a thunder-bolt fell at his feet;
he heard, with furprizing calmness, the follow­ ing words, more dreadful than thunder, pro­ nounced, viz.
That Chæreas was con­ ducting Callirrhoe back toSyracufe :
—Diony­ srus not thinking it late for him to reveal his sorrow, as the queen was found again.—
Most willingly, (said the king) 0 Dionysius !
would I restore Callirrhoe to thee, was it in my power;
as thou hast given me the moft shining proofs of thy affection and fidelity.
But as this is impossible, I now beflow on thee the government of all Ionia;
and thou shalt be enrolled, in the public records, as the chief benefactor to the royal house.—
Dionyfius Dionyfius then fell prostrate before his fo­ vereign;
expreffing the deep fenfe of his great obligations to him.
He then hafted away, in order that, when alone, he might weep at full liberty.
Statira, as he was de­ parting, gave him the letter privately.
Dio­ nyfius being returned home, fhut himfelf up;
when well knowing Callirrhoe's hand writing, he firft kissed the letter;
then opened, and preffing it to his bofom, held it there a long time, as though the adored Callirrhoe had been prefent;
his fast-flowing tears not per­ mitting him to read it.
After taking his fill of weeping, he began to perufe it, and firft kissed Callirrhoe's name ;
when coming to thefe words:
To Dionysius, her patron and benefactor :
—Alas!
(said he) no longer huf­ band ;
Then continuing:
—For thou art my my patron and benefactor, —— What good (faid Dionyfius) can I have done thee, to merit that title ?-With regard to the letter, Dionyfius was belt pleated with the excuse in it;
and he read the fame words over and over again, as Callirrhoe deemed to have left hull against her will;
fo volatile is love, and fo eafily do we perfuade ourfelves that we are beloved.
Then gazing on his fon ;
lifting him up, and fondly clafping him feveral times:
Thou, 0 my child!
(faid he) wilt one day go to thy mother, since it is her injunction:
while haplefs I shall fpend my sad days in Solitude, having brought all thefe evils upon myfelf.
A foolifh jealoufy, and Babylon, proved my ruin.
-Having fpoke thus, he prepared to go down to Ionia with all poffible expedition ;
imagining that the length length, and the diversity of the journey;
his command over fo many cities ;
and the houses which Callirrhoe dwelt in at Miletus, would foothe his profound melancholy.
VI.
Such was the situation of matters in Alia ;
during which Chæreas had a profpe­ rOllS voyage to Sicily;
the wind blowing always right a-stern, and himfelf being in the open sea with large gallies :
notwith­ standing which he was very much afraid, that he poffibly fhould be expofed to the rage of fome malicious Deity.
Being come within fight of Syracufe, Chæreas command­ ed the captains to adorn their respective gal­ lies ;
and to advance in clofe order, as it was a dead calm.
The people in the city fpying them, fame cried :
Whence come there lips ?
ships ?
Perhaps from Athens.
Be Hermo­ crates informed of this.—
Immediately a man hasted to him, and cried:
—0 Prætor !
what is to be done ?
Shall we fhut the ports, or put to fea, and meet yon gal­ lies :
for we know not whether a greater fleet is not behind, of which thefe vessels may be only the van ? ——
Hermocrates, at there words, flew from the public fquare to the sea-shorej and fent out a pinnace, which being come near to the fleet of gallies, the captain of the pinnace haled them, and en­ quired who they were?
To this one of the Egyptians, by Chæreas's command, re­ plied :
——We are merchants from Egypt, and bring a cargo which will fill the Syra­ cufians with joy.
Do not then (faid the other) come into the harbour all together;
for for the ships I fec are not trading vessels, but long gallies;
and feemingly fitted out for war.
Let therefore one galley only enter the port, while all the reft lie out at sea.—
This fhall be done, said the other.
-Here­ upon, firft entered Chæreas's galley ;
on the deck whereof flood a pavillion, with Baby­ lonish curtains round it.
The moment it was got near the harbour, this was instantly croud­ ed;
the common people being naturally cu­ rious, and very fond of novelty;
and they then flocked to the port from a variety of motives.
At the fight of the pavillion, they imagined that merchandize, of precious value, was under it.
Hereupon fome guessed one thing, fome another;
and all conjectured every thing except the right;
for it would have been abfurd to fuppofe, that thofe who thought thought Chæreas really dead, could believe him to be returning to his native country with a fleet of ships, and in fuch great fplendor.
The parents of Chæreas did not go out all that day.
Hermocrates attended as chief magistrate on this occasion, but clad in mourning, and in a private manner.
While the multitude were thus in doubt and fuf­ pence, with their eyes fixed on the galley, the curtains of the pavillion were fuddenly undrawn;
when Callirrhoe was discovered in a robe of Tyrian purple, and reclin­ ing on a golden bed;
with Chæreas by her fide, in the habit of chief admiral.
Never did thunder strike
So forcibly on the ear, nor lighting on the eye, as this spectacle :
nor did any man, at his finding a treafure, ever break into fuch loud excla­ mations, as did the populace at this unex­ pected pected fight, which furpaft all the powers of description.
Hermocrates flying to the tent, folded his daughter in his arms, and cried :
—
Art thou then living (my child !) or do I fee a phantom ?
O father!
(replied Callir­ rhoe) I now really live, since my eyes behold thee.
Tears of joy ran down every cheek.
In the mean time, Polycharmus brought the reft of the gallies into the harbour ;
Chæ­ reas having given him the command of the whole fleet, ever fince their departure from Cyprus ;
it being impoffible for him to at­ tend to any thing except his Callirrhoe.
Im­ mediately the port was filled;
when the fame spectacle was exhibited, as after a naval engagement with the Athenians;
the gallies now returning crowned from the war,and com­ manded by a Syracufian admiral.
The voices of of the multitude, faluting from the fea, were blended with those which answered them from shore :
when repeated mutual, kind expressions, praifes, and good wishes, echoed round and round.
Afterwards came Chæ­ reas's father, who had fainted through ex­ cefs of joy.
All the youths brought up with Chæreas, and who had been his com­ panions in the Gymnafium, came and crouded round him.
They being vastly defirous of faluting him;
while the women flocked no lees eagerly to Callirrhoe.
She now appear­ ed more beautiful than ever, in the eyes of the people :
and feemed a new Venus emerg­ ing from the ocean.
Chæreas then approach­ ing Hermocrates, and his father, said :
Take !
0 take the riches of the great king.—
At his command countless heaps of gold and Silver silver were instantly brought from on board the galley.
He afterwards produced, to the Syracufians, ivory, amber, rich fluffs;
and every thing precious and fplendid, whether with regard to the materials or workmanship;
together with the bed and table of the great king :
Insomuch that the whole city was now filled, not as formerly in the Sicilian war, with the mean goods and effects of the poor Athenians ;
but, (a furprizing and unheard of circumstance !) with the Spoils of the Modes, in time of peace.
VII.
Instantly the whole multitude cried :
—
Be an assembly held :
All longing to fee and hear the united pair.
And now the theatre was crouded, in a shorter time than words could exprefs, with men and women :
when when Chæreas entering fingly, all cried with the loudeR:
voice:
Be Callirrhoe called :
— Hermocrates being greatly beloved by the people, he, to oblige them, led his daughter into the theatre.
The populace first direct­ ing their eyes to heaven, praifed the gods ;
and thanked them more for this day, than for that on which they had triumphed over the Athenians.
They were afterwards divided into two parties;
the men applauding Chae­ reas, and the women Callirrhoe :
then both together, which beft pleated the enraptured pair.
Afterwards Callirrhoe, being fatigued with the voyage, and the violent agitation of her fpirits, faluted her country ;
and was conduced home.
But the assembly detained Chæreas ;
they being extremely defirous to bear the entire relation of his voyage, and the 2 the caufe of his absence.
However, he be­ gan by the last incidents ;
being unwilling to fadden the minds of the aflembly, by a de­ tail of melancholy events.
But they persisted, faying:
Begin, (as thou art requested) from the first.
Tell us all, and omit not a single circumstance.
Chæreas found a dif­ ficulty on this occasion ;
he being afhamed to relate many things which had befallen him, contrary to his will.
But Hermocrates laid :
Blush not (my fon !) though thou shouldest inform us of particulars which may be derogatory to thyfelf, or excite our for­ row;
fince, as the end is honourable and propitious, a veil will thereby be thrown over all the paft.
Whatever we fupprefs, raifes a suspicion of fomething still worse, from our very very silence.
Thou art fpeaking to thy country, and to thy parents, for both of which thou haft an equal affection.
The people are already acquainted with thy firft adventures, as they gave thee in marriage.
We all know the snares prepared for thee by thy rivals;
which inflaming thee with idle jealoufy, thou didft give thy wife an un­ happy blow :
that the, being fuppofed dead, was interred with all possible magnificence:
and that thou, being charged with murther, didft condemn thy self ;
thou wishing to die with thy wife:
but that the people acquitted thee, on finding the deed involuntary.
What followed has been told us:
how the facri­ legious Theron, having broke open the Mau­ foleum in the night, and finding Callirrhoe alive alive therein;
put her, with all the female ornaments and the sepulchral treasures, on board a pyrate vessel, and fold her in Ionia.
In what manner thou, failing from Syracufe in Search of thy wife, didft not meet with her;
but coming up afterwards at fea with a pyrate vend, didft find all the robbers on board her dead with thirst, except Theron, whom thou broughtest alive before an as­ fembly of the people;
when he being put to the torture, died at last on the crofs.
Next, how Syracuse, font out a galley, with an em­ bassy on board, for Callirrhoe :
and in what manner Polycharmus accompanied thee spon­ taneoufly in the voyage.
Thefe feveral par­ ticulars we already know.
Do thou there­ fore relate all that has happened to thee since since thy departure from this city.
Chæ­ reas then proceeded thus :
After having happily eroded the Ionian feat we call an­ char on the estate of a Milesian, Dionysius by name;
a man the most renowned in all Ionia, for richer for birth, and for, glory.
It was he who bought Callirrhoe of Theron for a talent :
—Here be not afraid, (con­ tinued Chæreas) she not being made a slave, but becoming a mistress the instant she was purchased;
for as Dionysius loved her, he would not ufe violence;
nor could he, on the other hand, prevail with himfelf to fend back to Sicily, a woman whom he ido­ lized.
Afterwards Callirrhoe, finding that she had conceived by out cohabitation;
and being desirous of preferving a citizen for you, you, fhe thence was reduced to the necef­ fity of marrying Dionyfius ;
and being de­ livered feven months after of a fon, fhe art­ fully pretended to have come before her time;
in order that the child might be fup­ pofed the offspring of Dionyfius, and re­ ceive an education fuitable to his high rank.
Thus (0 men of Syracufe) is your wealthy fel­ low-citizen nurtured in Miletus, under the eye of an illuftrious man.
He is a Greek, and of noble defcent.
Let us then not envy the child fo rich an inheritance.
—Thefe parti­ culars I was told afterwards.
VIII.
To return to my ftory.
Land­ ing at Miletus, and happening to fpy a fta- tue tue of Callirhoe in a temple, I thence con­ ceived fair hopes:
but fotne robbers flying over fea, came, in the dead of night, and fct fire to our galley.
They then murthered moft of the crew ;
and after throwing Poly­ charmus and myfelf in chains, fold us in Caria.
—At there words the multitude burft into moanings, when Chæreas fpake thus — Permit me to fupprefs what befel us after­ wards;
as confifting of events far more fad than any I have yet related.
——But as the people clamoured aloud, and infifted on hearing the whole, Chæreas went on as fol­ lows.
The man who purchased us was Servant to Mithridates governor of Caria ;
and he commanded us, then fettered, to plough plough the ground.
About this time fome of my fellow-slaves having killed their keeper, Mithridates Sentenced us all to die on the crofs.
As I was leading to execution, and going to fuffer, Polycharmus happened to utter my name, which was well known to Mithridates.
This governor had been Dio­ nyfius's gueft in Miletus;
and was prefent when my funeral obfequies were folemnized;
for Callirrhoe, on her being told concerning the burning of the galley, and of the robbers,.
had concluded me to be dead ;
and there­ upon raifed a fplendid Mausoleum to my me­ mory.
Inftantly Mithridates ordered me, when near expiring, to be taken from the crofs;
and afterwards ranked me among his bofom friends.
He next ufed his utmoft en- deavours deavours to get Callirrhoe reftored to mei and, for that purpofe, obliged me to write to her.
Now it happened that the letter, through the carelefnefs of the meffepger, fell into the hands of Dionyfius, who, not be­ lieving me alive;
but, on the contrary, imagining that Mithridates wanted to deduce his wife Callirrhoe, wrote forthwith to the king of Perfia;
falfely charging Mithridates with a defign to draw her away.
Hereupon the monarch, being refolved to try the caufe himfelf, fummoned all the parties to appear at his court.
This brought us to Babylon, whither Dionysus conducting Callirrhoe, her beauty, became, by that means, renown­ ed throughout all Afia.
On this occafion Mithridates made me the companion of his journey.
journey.
Being got to court, we ftrenuoufly defended our great caufe before the king, who foon acquitted Mithridates;
and pro­ mifed to judge whether Dionyfius, or my­ felf, ought to poffefs Callirrhoe;
who, dur­ ing that interval, was committed to the care of Statira.
Think, (0 Syracufians!) think, how often I fhould have laid violent hands on myfelf, thus tome from a wife I adored;
had not Polycharmus, my only faithful friend among the many who affumed that name, withheld my hand.
The king ne­ glected the trial;
he himfelf being enamour­ ed with Callirrhoe;
though he had not re­ course to perfuafive arts, nor employed vio­ lence.
In the mean time, Egypt breaking into open rebellion, a mighty war enfued, which which yet has been 6f the higher advantage to me:
for the queen, having taken Callir­ rhoe with her, I was deceived by a falfe re­ port, declaring that file had been decreed to Dionyfius;
which firing me with revenge, I deferted from the king of Perfia to the Egyptian.
On this occafion, great exploits were atchieved by me ;
I feizing upon Tyre which was almoft impregnable.
Being then appointed admiral, I overcame the king of Perfia in a naval engagement;
and took Aradus, where Artaxerxes had lodged Sta­ tira;
with the immenfe riches which you have feen.
Thus could I have made the Egyptian matter of all Afia, had not that monarch, fighting apart from me, loft his life in battles I now have gained you the king king of Perfia's favour, by my reftoring to him his confort ;
and by fending back, to the chief of the Perfian nobility, either their mothers, their lifters, their wives, or their daughters.
I have brought hither the moft valiant among the Greeks, with fuch Egyptians as would follow me voluntarily:
and another of your fleets, commanded by the grand-fon of Hermocrites, will, in due time, come hither from Jonia.
——Thefe­ words were no sooner-uttered, than the whole multitude fhouted for joy, and im­ plored every bleffing on his head.
Chæreas, after he had prevailed with them to be fi­ lent:
fpake thus Let Callirrhoe and I return, in your presence, the warmer thanks to our friend Polycharmus;
he having given us us the sincerest, the strongest marks of his affection and fidelity;
fo that, if you ap­ prove of it, we will bestow on him our sister in, marriage, with part of the fpoils as her dowry.
The people, with the louder shouts, approved of this propofal, crying:
- We (0 Polycharmus !) do return thee thanks, thou most excellent of men, and most faithful of friends!
Thou haft done important fer­ vices to thy country, and art worthy of Her­ mocrates and of Cbæreas.
Chæreas, after these acclamations, fpake as follows:
I intreat ye to bellow the freedom of your city on thefe three hundred Greeks, my powerful army.—
To this alfo the people, with re­ peated shouts, consented, crying:
They are worthy to be our sellow-citizens. ——
The The votes being taken, they were declared duly elected, and enrolled as citizens accord­ ingly.
And now taking their feats, they formed part of the assembly.
When Chx­ reas prefented each of them with a talent ;
and Hermocrates gave every Egyptian a piece of land to cultivate.
While the people con­ tinued yet in the theatre, Callirrhoe, before she returned home, went to the temple of Venus ;
when clafping her feet, she fell pro­ strate with her hair disheveled;
and killing the Goddefs, fpake thus Venus!
I thank thee for having fet Chæreas again before me in Syracufe;
where, by thy favour, I first when a virgin, beheld him.
I do not now reproach thee (O Deity!) for ray past woes, I having been decreed to suffer them.
I only befeech befeech thee to never Separate me more from Chæreas:
but to grant that our future life may be happy, and that we may expire by one common stroke of death.
Thus far I Chariton, of Aphrodifios, have writ concerning the loves of Chaereas and Callirrhoe.
