ÆSCHYLUS, son of Euphoriou, was born at Eleusis, B.C. 525..
His early employment to watch the grapes in a vineyard is traditionally reported to have led to the devclopement of his tragic genius, and possibly to some less excusable propensities of his character, in which the god Baccnus was equally con­ cerned.
He first appeared as a tragedian in B.C. 499, with Chœrilus and Pratinas for his competitors.
In B.C. 490, he distinguished himself at the battle of Marathon, in company with his brothers Cynegeirus and Ameinias.
In B.C. 484, he gained his first tragic victory, and in B.C. 480, he fought at Salamis:
thus, as Schlegel1 observes, “ he flourished in the very freshness and vigour of Grecian freedom, and a proud sense of the glorious struggle by which it was won, seems to have animated him and his poetry."
This warlike vein is con­ spicuous in the “ Persæ” and “ Seven against Thebes," while the " Agamemnon" is replete with pathetic illustrations of the toils, dangers, and sufferings, of a soldier's life.
His journeys into Sicily involve some intricate questions, but the received opinion seems to settle his first visit in B.C. 4G8, immediately after his defeat by Sophocles, and he pro­ bably spent some time there, if the use of Sicilian words in his later plays may be adduced as an argument.
The other journey was probably ten years after, B.C. 458, and, as Müller thinks, was undertaken in consequence of the aristocratic notions so freely expressed in his " Eumenides," which wert too openly opposed to the interests of Pericles' party, ther. in tIll ascendant, to render Athens a safe abode for our poet Other accounts state that a charge of impiety was the real cause of his second departure, and that he only escaped the fury of the populace, through the intervention of the Areopagus.
His death took place at Gela, B.C. 456.
The story is, that an eagle having mistaken his bald head for a stone, dropped a tortoise upon it in order to break the shell, and that the blow proved fatal.
There seems, however, little doubt but that our poet died in the ordinary course of nature, as his ad­ vanced age would render probable.
The number of plays written by Æschylus is doubtful, but, as in the case of Sophocles, seven only have survived the ravages of time.
Among these seven we are fortunate
In possessing a complete trilogy, consisting of the " Agamem­ non," “Choephoræ,” and “Eumenides.”
The remaining plays are the " Prometheus Bound," the “ Seven Chiefs against Thebes," the " Persians," and the " Suppliants.
"In criticising the plays of Æschylus, due regard must be had to the state in which Æschylus found the drama, and to the difference between his earlier and later works, as far as the existing specimens allow us to judge.
When we are told that Æschylus formed the dialogue of the Athenian stage, by adding a second actor, it is evident that the preceding dramas must have consisted of little else than a recitative and chorus alternately following each other.
The single actor probably detailed some legend possessing a mythological or local interest, while the chorus relieved the monotony by songs and dances connected with the subject.
If we consider the earliest specimens of our own drama, we shall find the dialogue heavy, and consisting of long para­ graphs, whilst the more modern stage limits these lengthy speeches to narrative, argument, or soliloquy.
But in the "Suppliants" of Æschylus, (which some scholars consider the most ancient specimen of the Greek drama that has descended to us in a complete form,) we shall find that the chorus are really the chief personages in the piece, and, as AEschylus is considered to have limited the functions of the chorus, it follows that the single actor was rather subservient to carrying on the story, than the hero of it.
And this agrees with Aristotle's account, that Æschylus " introduced an actor of first parts'," evidently shewing that the histrionic abilities previously required in the actor were of an inferior order.
Throughout the whole play of the " Suppliants," the pathos rests entirely with the chorus, the speeches of Danaus and the king are quiet and didactic, and even the herald lacks the haughtiness with which such persons are elsewhere invested.
Setting aside the chorus, the whole play exhibits a dead level of moral common places and mythical details.
It might indeed be read and performed "with characters omitted."
As far as the corrupt state of the choruses will allow us to judge, they were genial, brilliant, and graceful, but the very nature of a chorus destroyed all individualisation.
Their griefs, joys, and emotions, were common to all their number;
there were so many heroines, that there was no heroine.
There is another feature in the Supplices, which points to its extreme antiquity, and that is, its undramatic character.
In the first chorus we are told as much as we know at the end of the play.
Like the prologues prefixed to the comedies of Terence (unnecessary, as the plot is always the same), the opening chorus contains the whole argument of the piece.
The Danaïdes have fled from Egypt to avoid the lawless love of their kinsmen, they crave protection, are admonished to behave themselves;
they obtain protection, and, it is to be hoped, follow their father's advice.
There is, in fact, some­ thing half comic in the whole story, and the effect could only have been heightened by a concluding play in the trilogy (if there was any1), in which their punishment should have been so before the eyes of the spectator, with real tubs and real water.
After what has been said on the subject of the " Suppliants,” the reader will perhaps be surprised to find that Schlegel considers the " Persæ,” “ both in point of choice of subject, and the manner of handling it, undoubtedly the most im­ perfect of all the extant tragedies of this poet."
Æschylus certainly laboured under the same disadvantages as Lucan and Silius Italicus, in having chosen a subject too near his own time to possess a mythical interest, and too much de­ pending upon narrative to be truly dramatic.
But he suc­ cessfully appealed to the feelings of the audience, who doubt­ less listened to this panegyric upon Athens with as much satisfaction as an English audience applauded the braggart prologues " spoken upon occasion," during the last century.
There is too great a desire in German critics to elevate the standard of Athenian refinement.
The conclusion of the " Persians " savours too much of ridicule, to excite any high feelings of commiseration, and this play, like the “ Seven against Thebes," ought to have ended soone .
But in the episodes Æschylus has shown great power.
The prevailing notion throughout the play is of a deity favouring the Athenians, and overthrowing the haughty yoke of the Persians.
The atheistic impiety of Xerxes is hinted at, and his too-late repentance is an instance of the fatalism found throughout the "Agamemnon," and pervading the Æschylean drama.
The piety of the Greeks, on the contrary, is power­ fully contrasted, and the deity is accordingly represented as “ beginning the fight."
This description of the sea-fight is wonderfully animated, and could be written only by an eye- witness of the victory of Salamis, while the description of the fate of the miserable remnants of the Persian army, as de­ tailed by the messenger, is in the highest degree graphic.
Nor was the evocation of Darius less pleasing to an Athe­ nian mind.
The ancient prophecies of Bacis and others, which, although they might refer to mythical events, were nevertheless greedily seized upon, and applied to the present moment, and the recognition of ancient local traditions by supernatural powers, was an agreeable sacrifice to the vanity of the Athenians.
Every man would have exclaimed with Hamlet:
———— Touching this vision here.
It is an honest ghost ——Nay, Æschylus has excited a feeling of pity for the defeat of the Persians, by the amiable dignity with which he has in­ vested the character of their former lord.
The quiet, sub­ stantial steadiness of Darius is the most powerful satire upon the intemperance of their subsequent ruler that can be ima­ gined, and the whole evocation is invested with a mystical solemnity that makes uf forget its ideality.
Many critics consider the “ Persians ” as the earliest of the extant plays of Æschylus, but for the reasons above stated, I am inclined to give the higher antiquity to the “ Suppliants.
"If the “ Seven against Thebes" was connected with the “ Eleusinians," as Müller thinks, I scarcely believe that Æschylus would have ended with an anticlimax, by intro­ ducing the lamentations of Antigone and Ismena over their fallen brothers.
When this critic says, " this concluding scene points as distinctly as the end of the Choephoræ to the subject of a new piece, which was doubtless the Eleusinians1,’ " he asserts too much.
In the first place, it is clear from Plutarch (Thes. p. 14, A.).
that the burial of the chieftains was effected by Theseus under a truce, not by violence.
If, therefore, matters were amicably arranged, why should Antigone be “ closely connected with this subject.”
The fact is.
Muller has told us a great deal that we do not know, but has over­ looked the only point that Plutarch tells us respecting the “ Eleusinians," which, unfortunately contradicts his whole theory.
We might as well say that the threats of the Mycenian elders, at the end of the " Agamemnon,” neces­ sarily required the " Choephoræ,” to open with their revolt, as that, because Antigone threatens to bury her brother, Æschylus was obliged to make her do so in another play, of which all our knowledge only proves the contrary.
The theory of tetralogy has been carried much too far.
The “ Seven against Thebes" is doubtless an early play, and is as undramatic as the “ Persians."
But the high tone of true Grecian chivalry which reigns throughout, the splendid individuality of the characters, despite their one common feature of physical valour, is equal to anything, even in Æschylus.
The description of each warrior is not only a physical and heroic, but an ethical picture
The high-souled Amphiaraus, whose destiny led him to that death his wisdom foresaw, whose fate impelled him to that society his sense shrunk from, is pathetically contrasted with the mad boldness of the other chieftains.-his religion with their impiety-his modesty with their idle vaunting—his wisdom with their recklessness.
And when Eteocles praises him, we almost forget that he too lies under the ban of fate.
So good does Eteocles seem by his praise of the good.
In allusion to the question of a connexion between dramas, it may be worth while to observe the different degrees of fatalism that influence the minds of the two brothers in this play, and in the “ (Edipus at Colonus " of Sophocles.
Poly­ nices, in the latter play, is presented to us as the heart- broken fugitive, the wandering victim of a father's curse, softened by misfortune, and seeking to palliate the wrath of his destiny.
But in the Eteocles of JEschylus, there is no compunction.
He remembers the curse of his aged sire, and speaks even with affection of the man who had banned his lawless life by a paternal anathema.
But he seeks not to avert the doom.
Stern, uncompromising, he will meet the man he must slay, by whom he must himself fall.
Still, as Sophocles has softened the character of Polynices till he almost obtains our pity, so has Æschylus heightened that of Eteocles with sentiments of temperate prudence and un­ daunted courage, till he deserves it;
and in this respect both have exemplified the precept of Aristotle1.
shall now proceed to the consideration of the “ Prome­ neus,” the sublimest poem, and simplest tragedy of antiquity.
1 have one motive in doing so, in reference to that great triad of tragedies, the “ Oresteia," and that is to show the similar aristocratic spirit that pervades the whole of the four plays.
The Titan majesty of mankind had been infringed by the new gods of Olympus, and Prometheus appeared as their protector, the assertor of their rights.
Opposed to a new aristocracy, he was still the supreme power of the old one.
In the true spirit of the old aristocracy he laboured for the benefit of his weaker dependants.
The Olympian gods, like the parvenus of Aristotle1, are everywhere represented as oppressing mankind, and each other.
Moreover, Prometheus represents the intellectual ascendancy of mankind over the creation, the power of moral progress in opposition to phy­ sical strength and conventional resources.
The imprudence of Jove is hereafter to destroy that power, in the haughtiness of which he had thought fit to spurn the god of wisdom from him.
Much as I am disinclined to allegorical interpreters and interpretations, much as I dislike the tediousness of an Eustathius or the barbarism of a Fulgentius, still the “Pro­ metheus" of Æschylus cannot but seem a magnificent imper­ sonation of mind struggling against circumstances, intellect against force, providence against fate.
And the very fatalism of this play is pleasing.
Unlike the gloomy demon that lurks over the ill-fated house of Mycenæ, unlike the Fates that but exchange death for revenge, Prometheus is ever cheered by the triumphant prospect before him.
As he foresaw his present troubles, so he even names the time of their termination.
His very philanthropy, his inability to do further good, force from him the groan of the hero, but, as the good man meets death, so does he meet pain—conscious that there is something yet to come.
The introduction of Io is perfctly agreeable to Aristotle's idea of Episode, and enables us to learn the deeds of Pro­ metheus, and to test his powers of prescience.
Moreover, Prometheus and Io are both victims to the power of Zeus, both await their relief from his downfall.
The pathetic description of Io’s fall, her exclusion from the home of her sorrowing sire, her phantom-stricken wanderings over earth and sea, are all depictured with a power that proves how Æschylus could touch the tenderest, as well as the most lofty emotions of the human soul.
Muller has entered, with some ability, iuto the question of the discrepancy between the character of Zeus as pourtrayed in this play, and in the later works of our poet.
I grant that the tyrannical Zeus of this play is unlike the mild potentate, "who guides men in the ways of wisdom1,” or the great Zeus in heaven2," whose aid the fatherless may implore with confidence against their oppressors, but I do not see the necessity of reconciling the inconsistency.
If Æschylus could create a conception, he might also depart from it.
Zeus was as necessarily the tyrant in the Titan world, as he was the mild governor of things in the heroic ages.
But Müller has rightly observed, that this discrepancy is partly reconciled by the fact that Prometheus everywhere appears in the light of an offender against the " powers that be," too proud to reve­ rence Adrasteia.
Like Antigone, he is relatively guilty, In offending against ruling authorities;
like her, he is abstract­ edly right.
The sin of both is the sin of time and place, not of principle.
Shelley, whose whole poetry is deeply imbued with the mysterious power of AEschylus, has imitated the imagery of this play with a success proving that a man must be a poet to truly appreciate Æschylus.
It is to be regretted that this true genius, (like Knowles, so often disgraced by imitators.) never translated any productions of the Greek drama, with the single exception of the Satyric “ Cyclops " of Euripides.
He has invested his Prometheus with all the placid grandeur of the deity, all the tenderness of the good man.
To say that he imitates, in the modern sense, is to say nothing-to feel that the spirit of Æsehylus has passed into the mind of Shelley, is the fairest praise that can be awarded.
But the picturesque scenery of Shelley's painting is the marvellous feature of the play.
The Indian Caucasus, with its ice-bound rocks, and gloomy prospect of the world spread beneath it;
the sea, " heaven's ever-changing shadow," and the giant, grotesque glaciers, lost in the dim, chilled atmosphere, form a picture that the mind of Æschylus could conceive, but the hand of the Grecian painter could not imitate.
But circum­ stantial comparison will lead us too much away from the main subject.
The legend of Prometheus lives in the poetry of Æsehylus and Shelley.
The power of one poet can scarcely be measured but by the equality of the other.
The mention of scenery suggests a question of much æsthetic interest, namely, how far the Athenian artist could realise the conceptions of the poet.
In the " Prometheus " such an attempt must have been a failure.
Setting aside the question of the place of Prometheus' suffering, the poetry draws upon larger resources than the Athenian scene-painter could have possessed.
The architectural delineations of the fronts of palaces and other buildings, which usually formed the scene of the drama, were easily executed, and in a country pos­ sessing the finest models for imitation, were doubtless unsur­ passed for effect and correctness.
But the occasional land­ seape paintings on the periaktoi must have been rude, and even grotesque.
The most finished frescoes we possess arc totally devoid of any attempt to realise nature, the fragments of encaustic paintings are confined to the human form, and such objects as require no perspective;
and if we regard the paintings of the earliest Florentine artists, which sprung from the imitation of the latest Greek, improved by Cimabue, Giotto, and a few others, we shall find nothing to justify the supposition that the Greeks ever attained to any excellence in landscape painting.
The knowledge of aërial perspective, upon which all the realization of the "Prometheus" would depend, is scarcely three centuries old, and if we consider how long our own stage wanted such scenic accessories, we cannot be surprised at the deficiency of the Greeks.
The decorations of the Athenian stage were probably confined to costume and architectural embellishment.
Moreover, the fact that the plays were always represented in the day-time must have robbed them of all the exquisite illusion pro­ duced by the use and combinations of artificial lights.
Such being the case, how great was the power of the poet, who could so successfully place nature before his hearers by words only!
The testimony of the didascalia shows that the " Agamem­ non," " Choephorae," and " Eumenides," were performed at the same time, together with a satyric drama called the Pro­ teus.
We are, therefore, justified in considering them as forming a trilogy, although I doubt whether the “Oresteia1” is a fit name for the trilogy, when Orestes is only indirectly mentioned in the first and principal play.
Nor is the con­ nection between the three plays so exact as that which exists in the " King CEdipus," " CEdipus at Colonus," and " Anti­ gone " of Sophocles, which we know did not form a trilogy.
At all events, the thlee plays form the grandest dramatic work of antiquity.
It is true, we do not find the lights and shades of character pourtrayed with the delicate finish of Sophocles, nor is the character of Orestes invested with all the interest of which it might seem capable.
But Æschylus, unlike the modern adaptors, who write a piece for two actors in as many days, never sacrificed the play to enhance the character.
In a play like the " Prometheus," the hero was necessarily the leading character;
but in the Agamemno­ nian history there were no less than four great characters,-- Agamemnon, Orestes, Clytæmnestra, and Cassandra.
Nor are the minor parts of the Watchman, the Herald, and Ægisthus, devoid of strongly marked individuality, while Minerva, as Muller has remarked, may almost be considered as the leading character in the “ Eumenides.
"This attention to the minor characters is almost peculiar to Æschylus.
In the extant dramas of Sophocles we every­ where discover a greater amount of subordination to one leading.
feature, than elaborate filling out of the details.
Sophocles forms an abstraction, and not only embodies it in the character of the hero, but sacrifices all surrounding objects to the general conception.
The leading character is the type of a moral or religious principle;
the subordinate ones are but the means of argument and illustration.
In the Æschy lean trilogy the play, and not the hero, is the chief object of the poet's attention.
Each character is of weighty import, each leads on the action, and each possesses marked and dis­ tinct features that give vigour and freshness to every suc­ ceeding scene.
Moreover, Æschylus excites pity even for the unworthy, by not representing them utterly destitute of bet­ ter qualities.
The Clytæmnestra of Sophocles has not one redeeming trait, but Æschylus has found a partial excuse for his heroine in the fated misfortunes of the house of Atreus;
nor has he placed her illicit friendship for Ægis­ thus in so odious a light as Sophocles has done.
But the finest point is in the conclusion of the play, when, suddenly stricken with a sad consciousness, Clytæmnestra restrains the mad rage of Ægisthus, and exclaims, Enough of evil,-let no further stain imbrue our nands.
Unlike Lady Macbeth, she has no wish to sacrifice a Banquo to secure her victory.
She is a proud, daring woman, but her talents are unequalled.
To compare her with Lady Mac­ beth is, in some respects, a mistake.
Semiramis and Lucreeia Borgia are better parallels.
Nor must we less admire the picture of ancient manners which the " Agamemnon" presents to our view.
Like Rowena, Iphigenia had probably graced her father's table in the capacity of Hebe.
The third cup to the Preserver was perhaps hallowed by the innocence of the cup-bearer.
Like the petted daughter of some Saxon chieftain, she could smile away the remembrance of war and toil.
Macaulay’s exqui­ site portrait of Virginia gives a delightful idea of the re­ lation between father and daughter in the rough, old times.
But the conjugal relations were different.
The quiet, sensible replies of Agamemnon to his enquiring spouse remind us of Sir Halbert Glendinning's return, and, like Angelica in "Sir Harry Wildair," Clytæmnestra might well complain of the icy coldness of her spouse.
It is the meeting of a king and queen, and that is all.
Shakespere, on the contrary, has softened the character of Macbeth by traits of the most affec­ tionate attention to his demon spouse.
But if we remember the company in which Agamemnon returned, we shall scarcely be surprised.
Cassandra may possibly be regarded as a second thought of the poet
So complete is the play without her, that we can easily imagine that the fertility of the poet's imagination carried him on, when the play might otherwise not have exceeded the rest in length.
Be this as it may, the addition is magnifieent.
Power, terror, and pathos are alternately blended in this wonderful scene.
The weird boldness of the language, the terrific personification of the ancient horrors of the Atrean house, the changes from sad, sensible conscious­ ness to inspired madness, render this scene the most wonder­ ful of any on the Greek stage.
A Siddons alone could aet Cassandra.
The pedantic poem of Lyeophron is a strange contrast, and the imitations by Seneca equal even his worst attempts.
Virgil alone has approached equal sublimity in his description of the Cumæan Sibyl.
The time will I trust come, when the attempt to find an esoteric meaning in poetry will be set at its proper value.
All the allegorizing absurdities of the Greeks themselves never equalled the amount of dull nonsense that has been talked and written concerning these plays.
Can we believe that a poet, whose mind was wholly possessed with his subject, whose fiery, perturbed expressions almost struggled with each other to unfold the exuberance of the mind that sent them forth ;
-can we suppose that lie would stop short in his course in order to arrange an article or pronoun so as to convey a hidden political or religious axiom?
Can we suppose the Athenians so unpractical as to trouble themselves to hunt for such axioms, still less, to apply them ?
The most careful examination has convinced me that such allusions are always broad and distinet, as in the " Persæ,” not obscure and un­ intelligible, as the followers of Suvern generally seem to suppose.
Müller, who is much more learned, has likewise shewn much greater taste in his examination of the " Eumenides."
Although 1 eannot at all times agree with him, yet his know­ ledge is unquestionable, and his power of drawing inferences tempered with good taste and judgment.
The supposition that the excitement caused by Ephialtes was alluded to in this play has also occurred to Schlegel.
and bears much more appearance of probability than the generality of such theories.
I cannot, however, agree with Muller, that the action is almost at a stand-still in the " Choephoræ.”
There is not, it must be admitted, such vehement progress as in the "Aga­ memnon," but the discovery of Orestes by Electra, and the catastrophe of the play, are well united by a continued series of incidents, which, though trivial in themselves, lead 01 gradually and naturally to the consummation.
The chief weakness of the play is in the character of Orestes.
His dreadful purpose might well cause some wavering in his determination.
Sent from the paternal home at an early age he had not practically felt all his mother's cruelty, and some lurking remains of tenderness for her might remain.
But the will of heaven pursues him.
The terrors of disease, of cala­ mity in every shape, the Nemesis of the dead, all threaten him, should he swerve from his purpose.
Like Ctesiphon in " Ion," a father's murder calls upon him for revenge.
I have already touched upon the conclusion of the play, where Orestes seems to express a degree of pity and compunction over the body of Ægisthus.
I am aware that many will think the interpretation I have advocated rather too much for the text.
The mention of praise is so slight, that it may seem scarcely enough to express the feelings I attribute to Orestes But much might be done by the actor.
Those who remember Maeready's gesture and action in reading the few words addressed to the slain Polonius,— Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
1 took thee for thy betters :
-take thy fortune!
will readily perceive what pathos might be thrown into the brief speech of Orestes.
To write upon the " Eumenides" after Müller, would be almost a useless task.
So completely has this great scholar illustrated the spirit and allusions of this play, that the best commentator can do little but praise, quote, and refer to the German critic.
It is difficult to say who is the chief per­ sonage in the play.
The incident certainly turns upon Orestes, but there are so many different interests involved throughout the piece, that till the conclusion, when all parties are satisfied, we remain in suspense.
I shall best conclude these remarks by expressing a hope that my efforts to contribute to an acquaintance with Æschy­ lus may not be deemed an entire failure.
But I am painfully aware how much must be effected, how much got rid of, before we can congratulate ourselves on possessing Æschylus in a state even approaching his original magnificence.
PROMETHEUS having, by his attentior to the wants of men, provoking the anger of Jove, is bound down, in a cleft of a rock in a distant desert of Scythia.
Here he not only relates the wanderings, but foretells the future lot of Io, and likewise alludes to the fall of Jove's dynasty.
Disdaining to explain his meaning to Mercury, he is swept into the abyss amidst terrific hurricane and earthquake.

1We are come to a plain, the distant boundary of the earth, to the Scythian track, to an untrodden1 de­ sert.
Vulcan, it behoves thee that the mandates, which thy Sire imposed, be thy concern,-to bind this daring wretch2 to the lofty-cragged rocks, in fetters of adamantine chains that cannot be broken.
For he stole and gave to mortals thy honour, the brilliancy of fire [that aids] all arts8.
Hence for such a trespass he must needs give retribution to the gods;
that he may be taught to submit to the sovereignty of Jupiter, and to cease from his philanthropic disposition.
VULCAN.
Strength and Force, as far as you are concerned, the mandate of Jupiter has now4 its consummation, and there is no further obstacle.
But I have not the courage to bind perforce a kindred god to this weather-beaten ravine.
Yet in every way it is necessary for me to take courage for this task;
for a dreadful thing it is to disregard5 the directions of the Sire6.
Lofty-scheming son of right-counselling Themis, un­ willing shall I rivet thee unwilling in indissoluble shackles to this solitary rock, where nor voice nor form of any one of mortals shalt thou see7;
but slowly scorched by the bright blaze of the sun thou shalt lose the bloom of thy complexion;
and to thee joyous shall night in spangled robe1 veil the light;
and the sun again disperse the hoar-frost of the morn;
and evermore shall the pain of the present evil waste thee;
for no one yet born shall release thee.
Such fruits hast thou reaped from thy friendly disposition to mankind.
For thou, a god, not crouching beneath the wrath of the gods, hast imparted to mortals honours beyond what was right.
In requital whereof thou shalt keep sentinel on this cheerless rock, standing erect, sleepless, not bending a knee2:
and many laments and unavailing groans shalt thou utter;
for the heart of Jupiter is hard to be entreated;
and every one that has newly acquired power is stern.
ST.
Well, well!
Why art thou delaying and vainly commise­ rating?
Why loathest thou not the god that is most hate­ ful to the gods, who has betrayed thy prerogative to mortals ?
VUL.
Relationship and intimacy are of great power.
ST.
I grant it-but how is it possible to disobey the Sire's word?
Dreadest thou not this the rather?
VUL.
Aye truly thou art ever pitiless and full of boldness.
ST.
For to deplore this wretch is no cure [for him].
But concern not thou thyself vainly with matters that are of no advantage.
VUL. 0 much detested handicraft!
ST.
Wherefore loathest thou it!
for with the ills now pre­ sent thy craft in good truth is not at all chargeable.
VUL.
For all that, I would that some other had obtained this.
ST.
Every thing has been achieved except for the gods to rule;
for no one is free save Jupiter3.
VUL
I know it-and I have nothing to say against it1.
ST.
Wilt thou not then bestir thyself to cast fetters about this wretch, that the Sire may not espy thee loitering?
VUL.
Aye, and in truth you may see the manacles ready.
ST.
Take them, and with mighty force clench them with the mallet about his hands:
rivet him close to the crags.
VUL.
This work of ours is speeding to its consummation and loiters not.
ST.
Smite harder, tighten, slacken at no point, for he bath cunning to find outlets even from impracticable difficulties.
VUL.
This arm at all events is fastened inextricably.
ST.
And now clasp this securely, that he may perceive himself to be a duller contriver than Jupiter.
VUL.
Save this [sufferer], no one could with reason find fault with me-ST.
Now by main force rivet the ruthless fang of an ada­ mantine wedge right through his breast2.
VUL.
Alas!
alas!
Prometheus, I sigh over thy sufferings.
ST.
Again art thou hanging back, and sighest thou over the enemies of Jupiter?
Look to it, that thou hast not at some time to mourn for thyself.
VUL.
Thou beholdest a spectacle ill-sighted to the eye.
ST.
I behold this wretch receiving his deserts.
But fling thou these girths round his sides.
VUL.
I must needs do this;
urge me not very much.
ST. Aye, but I will urge thee, and set thee on too.
Move downwards, and strongly link his legs.
VUL.
And in truth the task is done with no long toil.
ST.
With main force now smite the galling fetters, since stern indeed is the inspector of this work.
VUL.
Thy tongue sounds in accordance with thy form.
ST.
Yield thou to softness, but taunt not me with ruth­ dessness and harshness of temper.
VUL.
Let us go;
since he hath the shackles about his limbs.
ST.
There now be insolent;
and after pillaging the prero­ gatives of the gods, confer them on creatures of a day.
In what will mortals be able to alleviate these agonies of thine ?
By no true title do the divinities call thee Prometheus;
for thou thyself hast need of a Prometheus, by means of which you will slip out of this fate1.

PROMETHEUS.
0 divine æther, and ye swift-winged breezes, and ye fountains of rivers, and countless dimpling3 of the waves of the deep, and thou earth, mother of all-and to the all-seeing orb of the Sun I appeal;
look upon me, what treatment I, a god, am enduring at the hand of the gods!
Behold with what indignities mangled I shall have to wrestle through time of years innumerable.
Such an ignominious bondage hath the new ruler of the immortals devised against me.
Alas!
alas!
I sigh over the present suffering, and that which is coming on.
How, where must a termination of these toils arise ?
And yet what is it I am saying?
I know beforehand all futurity exactly, and no suffering will come upon me unlooked-for.
But I needs must bear my doom as easily as may be, knowing as I do, that the might of Necessity cannot be resisted.
But yet it is not possible for me either to hold my peace, or not to hold my peace touching these my fortunes.
For having bestowed boons upon mortals, I am enthralled unhappy in these hardships.
And I am he that searched out the source of fire, by stealth borne-off enclosed in a fennel-rod1, which has shewn itself a teacher of every art to mortals, and a great resource.
Such then as this is the vengeance that I endure for my trespasses, being rivetted in fetters beneath the naked sky.
Hah!
what sound, what ineffable odour2 hath been wafted to me, emanating from a god, or from mortal, or of some intermediate nature?
Has there come any one to the remote rock as a spectator of my sufferings, or with what intent3!
Behold me an ill-fated god in durance, the foe of Jupiter, him that hath incurred the detestation of all the gods who frequent the court of Jupiter, by reason of my ex­ cessive friendliness to mortals.
Alas!
alas!
what can this hasty motion of birds be which J again hear hard by me ?
The air too is whistling faintly with the whirrings of pinions.
Every thing that approaches is to me an object of tread.
CHORUS.
Dread thou nothing;
for this is a friendly band that has come with the fleet rivalry of their pinions to this rock, after prevailing with difficulty on the mind of our ather.
And the swiftly-wafting breezes escorted me:
for the echo of the clang of steel pierced to the recess of our grots, and banished my demure-looking reserve;
and I sped without my sandals in my winged chariot.
PR. Alas! alas!
ye offspring of prolific Thetys, and daughters of Ocean your sire, who rolls around the whole earth in his unslumbering stream;
look upon me, see clasped in what bonds I shall keep an unenviable watch on the top­ most crags of this ravine.
On.
I see, Prometheus:
and a fearful mist full of tears darts over mine eyes, as I looked on thy frame withering on the rocks1 in these galling adamantine fetters:
for new pilots are the masters of Olympus;
and Jove, contrary to right, lords it with new laws, and things aforetime had in reverence he is obliterating.
PR. Oh would that he had sent me beneath the earth, and below into the boundless Tartarus of Hades that re­ ceives the dead, after savagely securing me in indissoluble bonds, so that no god at any time, nor any other being, had exulted in this my doom.
Whereas now, hapless one, I, the sport of the winds, suffer pangs that gladden my foes.
CH.
Who of the gods is so hard-hearted as that these things should be grateful to him?
Who is there that sympa­ thizes not with thy sufferings, Jove excepted?
He indeed, in his wrath, assuming an inflexible temper, is evermore oppressing the celestial race!
nor will he cease before that either he shall have sated his heart, or some one by some stratagem shall have seized upon his sovereignty that will be no easy prize.
PR. In truth hereafter the president of the immortals' shall have need of me, albeit that I am ignominiously suffer­ ing in stubborn shackles, to discover to him the new plot by which he is to be despoiled of his seeptre and his honours.
But neither shall he win me by the honey-tongued charms of persuasion;
nor will I at any time, crouching beneath his stern threats, divulge this matter, before he shall have released me from my cruel bonds, and shall be willing to yield me retribution for this outrage.
CH.
Thou indeed both art bold, and yieldest nought to thy bitter calamities, but art over free in thy language.
But piercing terror is worrying my soul;
for I fear for thy for­ tunes.
How, when will it be thy destiny to make the haven and see the end of these thy sufferings?
for the son of Saturn has manners that supplication cannot reach, and an inexorable heart.
PR. I know that Jupiter is harsh, and keeps justice to himself:
but for all that he shall hereafter be softened in purpose, when he shall be crushed in this way;
and, after calming his unyielding temper with eagerness will he hereafter come into league and friendship with me that will eagerly [welcome him.]
On.
Unfold and speak out to us the whole story, from what accusation has Jupiter seized thee, and is thus disgrace- fully and bitterly tormenting thee.
Inform us, if thou be in no respect hurt by the recital.
PR. Painful indeed are these things for me to tell, and painful too for me to hold my peace, and in every way grievous.
As soon as the divinities began discord, and a feud was stirred up among them with one another,­ one party1 wishing to eject Saturn from his throne, in order forsooth that Jupiter might be king, and others expediting the reverse, that Jupiter might at no time rule over the gods :
-then I, when I gave the best advice, was not able to prevail upon the Titans, children of Uranus and Terra;
but they, contemning in their stout spirits wi y schemes, fancied that without any trouble, and by dint of main force, they were to win the sovereignty.
But it was not once only that my mother Themis, and Terra, a single person with many titles, had forewarned me of the way in which the future would be accomplished;
how it was destined, that, not by main force, nor by the strong hand, but by craft the victors should prevail.
When, however, I explained such points in discourse, they deigned not to pay me any re­ gard at all.
Of the plans which then presented themselves to me, the best appeared, that I should take my mother and promptly side with Jupiter, who was right willing [to receive us].
And 'tis by means of my counsels that the murky abyss of Tartarus overwhelms the antique Saturn, allies and all.
After thus being assisted by me, the tyrant of the gods hath recompensed me with this foul recom­ pense.
For somehow this malady attaches to tyranny, not to put confidence in its friends.
But for your inquiries upon what charge is it that he outrages me, this I will make clear.
As soon as he had established himself on his father s throne, he assigns forthwith to the different divinities each his honours, and he was marshalling in order his empire:
but of woe-begone mortals he made no account, but wished, after having annihilated the entire race, to plant another new one.
And these schemes no one opposed except myself.
But I dared:
I ransomed mortals from being utterly destroyed, and going down to Hades.
'Tis for this, in truth, that I am bent by sufferings such as these, agonising to endure, and piteous to look upon.
I that had compassion for mortals, have myself been deemed unworthy to obtain this, but mer­ cilessly am thus coerced to order, a spectacle inglorious to Jupiter.
CH.
Iron-hearted and formed of rock too, Prometheus, is he, who condoles not with thy toils:
for I could have wished never to have beheld them, and now, when I behold them, I am pained in my heart.
PR. Aye, in very deed I am a piteous object for friends to behold.
CH.
And didst thou chance to advance even beyond this ?
PR. Yes!
I prevented mortals from foreseeing their doom.
CH.
By finding what remedy for this malady?
PR. I caused blind hopes to dwell within them.
CH.
In this thou gavest a mighty benefit to mortals.
PR. Over and above these boons, however, I imparted fire to them.
CH.
And do the creatures of a day now possess bright fire?
PR. Yes—from which they will moreover learn thoroughly many arts.
CH.
Is it indeed on charges such as these that Jupiter is both visiting thee with indignities, and in no wise grants thee a respite from thy pains?
And is no period to thy toils set before thee?
PR. None other assuredly, but when it may please him.
On.
And how shall it be his good pleasure ?
What hope is there ?
Seest thou not that thou didst err ?
but how thou didst err, I cannot relate with pleasure, and it would be a pain to you.
But let us leave these points, and search thou for some escape from thine agony.
PR. 'Tis easy, for any one that hath his foot unen­ tangled by sufferings, both to exhort and to admonish him that is in evil plight.
But I knew all these things willingly, willingly I erred, I will not gainsay it:
and in doing service to mortals I brought upon myself sufferings.
Yet not at all did I imagine, that, in such a punishment as this, I was to wither away upon lofty rocks, meeting with this desolate solitary erag.
And yet wail ye not over my present sor­ rows, but after alighting on the ground, list ye to the fortune that is coming on, that ye may learn the whole throughout.
Yield to me, yield ye, take ye a share in the woes of him that is new suffering.
Henee in the same way doth cala­ mity roaming to and fro settle down on different indi­ viduals.
CH.
Upon those who are nothing loath hast thou urged this, Prometheus :
and now having with light step quitted my rapidly-wafted chariot-seat, and the pure æther, highway of the feathered race, I will draw near to this rugged ground:
and I long to hear the whole tale of thy sufferings.
I am arrived at the end of a long journey1, having passed over Liti to thee, Prometheus, guiding this winged steed of mine, swift of pinion, by my will, without a bit;
and, rest assured, I sorrow with thy misfortunes.
For both the tie of kindred thus constrains me, and, relationship apart, there is no one on whom I would bestow a larger share [of my regard] than to thyself.
And thou shalt know that these words are sincere, and that it is not in me vainly to do lip-service:
for come, signify to me in what it is necessary for me to assist thee ;
for at no time shalt thou say that thou hast a stauncher friend than Oceanus.
PR. Hah!
what means this?
and hast thou too come to be a witness of my pangs ?
How hast thou ventured, after quitting both the stream that bears thy name, and the rock- roofed self-wrought1 grots, to come into the iron-teeming land ?
Is it that you may contemplate my misfortunes, and as sympathising with my woes that thou hast come ?
Behold a spectacle, me here the friend of Jupiter, that helped to establish his sovereignty, with what pains I am bent by him.
Oc.
I see, Prometheus, and to thee, subtle as thou art, I wish to give the best counsel.
Know thyself, and assume to thyself new manners ;
for among the gods too there is a new monarch.
But if thou wilt utter words thus harsh and whet­ ted, Jupiter mayhap, though seated far aloft, will hear thee, so that the present bitterness of sufferings will seem to thee to be child's play.
But, 0 hapless one, dismiss the passion which thou feelest, and search for a deliverance from these sufferings of thine.
Old-fashioned maxims these, it may be I appear to thee to utter;
yet such become the wages of the tongue that talks too proudly.
But not even yet art thou humble, nor submittest to ills ;
and in addition to those that already beset thee, thou art willing to bring others upon thee.
Yet not, if at least thou takest me for thy instructor, wilt thou stretch out thy leg against the pricks;
as thou seest that a harsh monarch, and one that is not subject to control, is lording it.
And now I for my part will go, and will essay, if I be able, to disenthral thee from these thy pangs.
But be thou still, nor be over impetuous in thy language.
What!
knowest thou not exactly, extremely intelligent as thou art, that punishment is inflicted on a froward tongue ?
PR.
I give thee joy, because that thou hast escaped censure, after taking part in and venturing along with me in all things.
And now leave him alone, and let it not concern thee.
For in no wise wilt thou persuade him ;
for he is not open to persuasion.
And look thou well to it that thou take not harm thyself by the journey.
Oc.
Thou art far better calculared by nature to Instruct thy neighbours than thyself:
I draw my conclusion from fact, and not from word.
But think not for a moment to divert me from the attempt.
For I am confident, yea, I am confident, that Jupiter will grant me this boon, so as to release thee from these pangs of thine.
PR. In part I commend thee, and will b) no means at any time cease to do so.
For in zeal to serve me thou laekess nothing.
But trouble thyself not;
for in vain, without being of any service to me1, wilt thou labour, if in any respect thou art willing to labour.
But hold thou thy peace, and keep thy­ self out of harm's way;
for I, though 1 be in misfortune, would not on this account be willing that sufferings should befal as many as possible.
No, indeed, since also the disasters of my brother Atlas gall my heart, who is stationed
In the western regions, sustaining on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and of earth, a burthen not of easy grasp.
I commiserated too when I beheld the earthborn inmate of the Cilician caverns, a tremendous prodigy, the hundred-headed impetuous Typhon, overpowered by force, who withstood all the gods, hissing slaughter from his hungry jaws;
and from his eyes there flashed a hideous glare, as though he would perforce over­ throw the sovereignty of Jove.
But the sleepless shaft of Jupiter came upon him, the descending thunderbolt breathing forth flame, which scared him out of his presumptuous brava­ does ;
for having been smitten to his very soul he was crum­ bled to a cinder, and thunder-blasted in his prowess.
And now, a helpless and paralyzed form, is he lying hard by a narrow frith, pressed down beneath the roots of Ætna2.
And. seated on the topmost peaks, Vulcan forges the molten masses, whence there shall one day burst forth floods de­ vouring with fell jaws the level fields of fruitful Sicily:
with rage such as this shall Typhon boil over in hot artillery of a never-glutted fire-breathing storm;
albeit he hath been re­ duced to ashes by the thunderbolt of Jupiter.
But thou art no novice, nor needest thou me for thine instructor.
Save thyself as best thou knowest how;
but I will exhaust my present fate until such time as the spirit of Jupiter shall abate its wrath.
Oc.
Knowest thou not this then, Prometheus, that words are the physicians of a distempered feeling1 ?
PR.
True, if one seasonably soften down the heart, and do not with rude violence reduce a swelling spirit.
Oc.
Aye, but in foresight along with boldness' what mischief is there that thou seest to be inherent ?
inform me.PR. Superfluous trouble and trifling folly.
Oc.
Suffer me to sicken in this said sickness, since 'tis o the highest advantage for one that is wise not to seem to be wise.
PR. (Not so, for) this trespass will seem to be mine.
Oc.
Thy language is plainly sending me back to my home.
PR. Lest thy lamentation over me bring thee into ill-will.
Oc.
What with him who hath lately seated himself on the throne that rnleth over all ?
PR.
Beware of him lest at any time his heart be moved to wrath.
Oc.
Thy disaster, Prometheus, is my monitor.
PR. Away!
withdraw thee, keep thy present determi­ nation.
Oc.
On me, hastening to start, hast thou urged this in­ junction ;
for my winged quadruped flaps with his pinions the smooth traek of æther;
and blithely would he recline his limbs in his stalls at home.
[Exit OCEAN.CH.
I bewail thee for thy lost fate, Prometheus.
A flood of trickling tears from my yielding eyes has bedewed my cheek with its humid gushings :
for Jupiter commanding this thineunenviable doom by laws of his own, displays his spear appearing superior o'er the gods of old1.
And now the whole land echoes with wailing-they wail thy stately and time-graeed honours, and those of thy brethren;
and all they of mortal raee that occupy a dwelling neighbouring on hallowed Asia mourn with thy deeply-deplorable suf­ ferings :
the virgins that dwell in the land of Colehis too, fear­ less of the fight, and the Scythian horde who possess the most remote region of earth around lake Mæotis:
and the warlike flower of Arabia3, who occupy a fortress on the craggy heights in the neighbourhood of Caucasus, a warrior-host, clamouring amid sharply-barbed spears.
One other god only indeed have I heretofore beheld in miseries, the Titan Atlas, subdued by the galling of ada­ mantine' bonds, who evermore in his back is groaning beneath' the excessive mighty mass of the pole of heaven.
And the billow of the deep roars as it falls in cadence, the depth moans, and the murky vault of Hades rumbles beneath the earth, and the fountains of the pure streaming rivers wail for his piteous pains.
PR. Do not, I pray you, suppose that I am holding ray peace from pride or self-will:
but by reflection am I gnawed to the heart, seeing myself thus ignominously entreated3.
And yet who but myself defined completely the preroga­ tives for these same new gods ?
But on these matters I say nothing, for I should speak to you already acquainted with these things.
But for the misfortunes that existed among mortals, hear how I made them, that aforetime lived as infants, rational and possessed of intellect4.
And I will tell you, having no complaint against mankind, as detailing the kindness of the boons which I bestowed upon them :
— they who at first seeing saw in vain, hearing they heard not.
But, like to the forms of dreams, for a long time they used to huddle together all things at random, and nought knew they about brick-built5 and sun-ward houses, nor carpentry:
but they dwelt in the excavated earth like tiny emmets in the sunless depths of caverrs.
And they had no sure sign either of winter, or of flowery spring, or of fruitful summer:
but they used to do every thing without judgment, until indeed I showed to them the risings of the stars and their settings1, hard to be discerned.
And verily I discover for them Numbers, the surpassing all inventions2, the combinations too of letters, and Memory, effective mother-nurse of all arts.
I also first bound with yokes beasts submissive to the collars;
and in order that with their bodies they might become to mortals substitutes for their severest toils, I brought steeds under ears obedient to the reins, a glory to pompous luxury.
And none other than I invented the canvas-winged chariots of mariners that roam over the ocean.
After discovering for mortals such inventions, wretch that I am, I myself have no device whereby I may escape from my present misery.
On.
Thou hast suffered unseemly ills, baulked in thy dis­ cretion thou art erring ;
and like a bad physician, having fallen into a distemper thou art faint-hearted, and, in re­ ference to thyself, thou canst not discover by what manner of medicines thou mayest be cured.
PR. When thou hearest the rest of my tale, thou wilt wonder still more what arts and resources I contrived.
For the greatest-if that any one fell into a distemper, there was no remedy, neither in the way of diet, nor of liniment, nor of potion, but for lack of medicines they used to pine away to skeletons, before that I pointed out to them the composition4 of mild remedies, wherewith they ward off all their maladies.
Many modes too of the divining art did 1 classify, and was the first that discriminated among dreams those which are destined to be a true vision;
obscure vocal omens1 too I made known to them;
tokens also incidental on the road, and the flight of birds of crooked talons I clearly defined, both those that are in their nature auspicious, and the ill-omened, and what the kind of life that each leads, and what are their feuds and endearments2 and intercourse one with another:
the smoothness too of the entrails, and what hue they must have to be acceptable to the gods, the various happy for­ mations of the gall and liver, and the limbs enveloped in fat:
and having roasted the long chine I pointed out to mortals the way into an abstruse art;
and I brought to light the fiery sym­ bols3 that were aforetime wrapt in darkness.
Such indeed were these boons;
and the gains to mankind that were hidden under ground, brass, iron, silver, and gold,-who could assert that he had discovered before me ?
No one, I well know, who does not mean to idly babble.
And in one brief sentence learn the whole at once-All arts among the human race are from Prometheus.
On.
Do not now serve the human race beyond what is profitable, nor disregard thyself in thy distress:
since I have good hopes that thou shalt yet be liberated from these shackles, and be not one whit less powerful than Jove.
PR.
Not at all in this way is Fate, that brings events to their consummation ordained to accomplish these things :
but after having been bent by countless sufferings and calamities, thus am I to escape from my shackles.
And art is far less powerful than necessity.
CH.
Who then is the pilot of necessity?
PR. The triform Fates and the remembering Furies.
CH.
Is Jupiter then less powerful than these?
PR. Most certainly he cannot at any rate escape his doom1.
CH.
Why, what is doomed for Jupiter but to reign for evermore ?
PR.
This thou mayest not yet learn, and do not press it.
CH.
'Tis surely some solemn mystery that thou veilest.
PR. Make mention of some other matter;
it is by no means seasonable to proclaim this;
but it must be shrouded in deepest concealment:
for it is by keeping this secret that I am to escape from my ignominious shackles and miseries.
CH.
Never may Jupiter, who directs all things, set his might in opposition to my purpose, nor may I be backward in attending upon the gods at their hallowed banquets, at which oxen are sacrificed, beside the restless stream of my sire Ocean;
and may I not trespass in my words;
but may this feeling abide by me and never melt away.
Sweet it is to pass through a long life in confident hopes, making the spirits swell with bright merriment;
but I shudder as I behold thee harrowed by agonies Incalculable ....
For not standing in awe of Jupiter, thou, Prometheus, in thy self-will honourest mortals to excess.
Come, my friend, own how boonless was the boon ;
say where is any aid ?
What relief can come from the creatures of a day ?
Sawest.
thou not the powerless weakness, nought better than a dream, in which the blind race of men is entangled ?
Never shall at any time the schemes of mortals evade the harmonious system of Jupiter.
This I learned by witnessing thy destructive fate, Prometheus.
And far different is this strain that now flits towards me from that hymenæal chant which I raised around the baths and thy couch with the consent2 of nuptials, when, after having won Hesione with thy love-tokens, thou didst conduct her our sister to be thy bride, the sharer of thy bed.
What land is this?
what race?
whom shall I say I here behold storm-tossed in rocky fetters?
Of what trespass is the retribution destroying thee?
Declare to me into what part of earth I forlorn have roamed.
Ah me!
alas!
alas!
again the hornet2 stings me miserable:
0 earth avert3 the goblin of earth-born Argus4:
I am terrified at the sight of the neatherd of thousand eyes, for he is journeying on, keeping a cunning glance, whom not even after death does earth conceal:
but issuing forth from among the de­ parted he chases me miserable, and he makes me to wan­ der famished along the shingled strand, while the sound­ ing wax-compacted pipe drones on a sleepy strain.
Oh!
oh!
ye powers!
Oh!
powers!
whither do my far-roaming wanderings convey me?
In what, in what, 0 son of Sa­ turn, hast thou, having found me transgressing, shackled me in these pangs?
Ah! ah!
and art thus wearing out a timorous wretch phrensied with sting-driven fear.
Burn me with fire, or bury me in earth, or give me for food to the monsters of the deep, and grudge me not these prayers, 0 king!
Amply have my much-traversed wanderings harassed me;
nor can I discover how I may avoid pain.
Hearest thou the address of the ox-horned maiden ?
PR.
How can I fail to hear the damsel that is phrenzy- driven by the hornet, the daughter of Inachus, who warms the heart of Jupiter with love, and now, abhorred of Juno, is driven perforce courses of exceeding length?
Io.
From whence utterest thou the name of my father?
Tell me, the woe-begone, who thou art, who, I say, 0 hap­ less one, that hast thus correctly accosted me miserable, and hast named the heaven-inflicted disorder which wastes me, fretting with its maddening stings?
Ah!
ah!
violently driven by the famishing tortures of my boundings have I come a victim to the wrathful counsels of Juno.
And of the ill-fated who are there, ah me!
that endure woes such as mine ?
But do thou clearly define to me what remains for me to suffer, what salve,:
what remedy there is for my malady, discover to me, if at all thou knowest:
speak, tell it to the wretched roaming damsel.
Pit.
I will tell thee clearly everything which thou desirest to learn, not interweaving riddles, but in plain language, as it is right to open the mouth to friends.
Thou scest him that bestowed fire on mortals, Prometheus.
Io.
0 thou that didst dawn a common benefit upon more, ViIs, wretched Prometheus, as penance for what offence art you thus suffering?
PR. I have just ceased lamenting my own pangs.
Io.
Wilt thou not then accord to me this boon?
PR. Say what it is that thou art asking, for thou mightest learn every thing from me.
Io.
Say who it was that bound thee fast in this cleft?
PR. The decree of Jupiter, but the hand of Vulcan.
Io.
And for what.
offences art thou paying the penalty?
PR. Thus much alone is all that I can clearly explain to thee.
Io.
At least, in addition to this, discover what time shall be to me woe-worn the limit of my wanderings.
PR. Not to learn this is better for thee than to learn it.
Io.
Yet conceal not from me what I am to endure.
PR. Nay, I grudge thee not this gift.
Io.
Why then delayest thou to utter the whole?
PR. 'Tis not reluctance, but I am loth to shock thy feelings.
Io.
Do not be more anxious on my account than is agree­ able to me1.
PR. Since thou art eager, I must needs tell thee:
attend thou.
CH.
Not yet, however;
but grant me also a share of the pleasure.
Let us first learn the malady of this maiden, from her own tale of her destructive2 fortunes;
but, for the sequel of her afflictions let her be informed by thee.
PR. It is thy part, Io, to minister to the gratification of these now before thee, both for all other reasons, and that they are the sisters of thy father.
Since to weep and lament over misfortunes, when one is sure to win a tear from the listeners, is well worth the while.
Io.
I know not how I should disobey you;
and in a plain tale ye shall learn every thing that ye desire:
and yet 1 am pained even to speak of the tempest that hath been sent upon me from heaven, and the utter marring of my per- son, whence it suddenly came upon me, a wretched crea­ ture !
For nightly visions thronging to my maiden chamber, would entice me with smooth words:
"0 damsel, greatly fortunate, why dost thou live long time in maidenhood, when it is in thy power to achieve a match the very noblest ?
for Jupiter is fired by thy charms with the shaft of passion, and longs with thee to share in love.
But do not, my child, spurn away from thee the couch of Jupiter;
but go forth to Lerna's fertile mead, to the folds and ox-stalls of thy father, that the eye of Jove may have respite from its long­ ing."
By dreams such as these was I unhappy beset every night, until at length I made bold to tell my sire of the dreams that haunted me by night.
And he despatched both to Pytho and to Dodonal many a messenger to consult the oracles, that he might learn what it behoved him to do or say, so as to perform what was well-pleasing to the divinities.
And they came bringing a report back of ora­ cles ambiguously worded, indistinct, and obscurely deli­ vered.
But at last a clear response came to Inachus, plainly charging and directing him to thrust me forth both from my home and my country, to stray an outcast to earth's remotest limits;
and that, if he would not, a fiery-visaged thunder­ bolt would come from Jupiter, and utterly blot out his whole race.
Overcome by oracles of Loxias such as these, un­ willing did he expel and exclude me unwilling from his dwel­ ling :
but the bit of Jupiter2 perforce constrained him to do this And straightway my person and my mind were distorted, and horned, as ye see, stung by the keenly-biting fly, I rushed with maniac boundings to the sweet stream of Cerch­ neia, and the fountain3 of Lerna:
—and the earth-born neat­ heard Argus of untempered fierceness, kept dogging me, peering after my footsteps with thick-set eyes.
Him, how­ ever, an unlooked-for sudden fate bereaved of life;
but I hornet-striken am driven by the scourge divine from land to land.
Thou hearest what has taken plaee, and f thou art able to say what pangs there remain for me, declare them;
and do not, compassionating me, warm me with false tales, for I pronounce fabricated statements to be a most foui malady.
On.
Ah! ah! forbear!
Alas!
Never never did I expect that a tale [so] strange would come to my ears, or that sufferings thus horrible to witness and horrible to endure, outrages, terrors with their two-edged goad, would chill my spirit.
Alas!
alas! 0 Fate!
Fate!
I shudder as I behold the condition of Io.PR.
Prematurely, however, art thou sighing, and art full of terror.
Hold, until thou shalt also have heard the residue.
CH. Say on;
inform me fully:
to the sick indeed it is sweet to get a clear knowledge beforehand of the sequel of their sorrows.
PR. Your former desire at any rate ye gained from me easily;
for first of all ye desired to be informed by her recital of the affliction!
that attaches to herself.
Now give ear to the rest, what sort of sufferings it is the fate of this young damsel before you to undergo at the hand of Juno:
thou too, seed of Inachus, lay to heart my words, that thou mayest be fully informed of the termination of thy journey.
In the first plaee, after turning thyself from this spot towards the rising of the sun, traverse unploughed fields;
and thou wilt reach the wandering Scythians.
who, raised from off the ground, inhabit wicker dwellings on well-wheeled ears, equipped with distant-shooting bows;
to whom thou must not draw near, but pass on out of then land, bringing thy feet to approach the rugged roaring shores.
And on thy left band dwell the Chalybes, workers of iron, of whom thou must needs beware, for they are barbarous, and not accesi­ ble to strangers.
And thou wilt come to the river Hybristes2, not falsely so called, which do not thou cross, for it is not easy to ford, until thou shalt have come to Caucasus itself, loftiest of mountains, where from its very brow the river spouts forth its might.
And surmounting its peaks that neighbour on the stars, thou must go into a south­ ward track, where thou wilt come to the man-detesting host of Amazons, who hereafter shall make a settlement, The­ miseyra, on the banks of Thermodon, where lies the rug­ ged Salmydessian sea-gorge, a host by mariners hated, a step-dame to ships;
and they will conduct thee on thy way, and that right willingly.
Thou shalt come too to the Cimmerian ithsmus, hard by the very portals of a lake, with narrow passage, which thou undauntedly must leave, and cross the Mæotie frith;
and there shall exist for ever­ more among mortals a famous legend concerning thy passage, and after thy name it shall be called the Bosphorus;
and after having quitted European ground, thou shalt come to the Asiatic continent.
Does not then the sovereign of the gods seem to you to be violent alike towards all things?
for he a god lusting to enjoy the charms of this mortal fair one, bath cast upon her these wanderings.
And a bitter wooer, maiden, hast thou found for thy hand;
for think that the words which thou hast now heard are not even for a prelude.
Io.
Woe is me!
ah!
ah!
PR.
Thou too in thy turn art crying out and moaning :
what wilt thou do then, when thou learnest the residue of thy ills?
CH. What!
hast thou aught of suffering left to tell to ner?
PR. Aye, a tempestuous sea of baleful calamities.
Io.
What gain then is it for me to live ?
but why did I not quickly fling myself from this rough precipice, that dash ing on the plain I had rid myself of all my pangs?
for better is it once to die, than all one's days to suffer ill.
PR. Verily thou wouldst hardly bear the agonies of me to whom it is not doomed to die.
For this would be an escape from sufferings.
But now there is no limit set to my hard­ ships, until Jove shall have been deposed from his tyranny.
Io.
What!
is it possible that Jupiter should ever fall from his power?
PR. Glad wouldst thou be, I ween, to witness this event.
Io.
And how not so, I, who through Jupiter am suffering ill?
PR. Well then thou mayest assure thyself of these things that they are so.
Io.
By whom is he to be despoiled of his seeptre of ty­ ranny.
PR. Himself, by his own senseless counsels.
PR. He will make such a match as he shall one day rue1.
Io.
Celestial or mortal?
If it may be spoken, tell me.
PR. But why ask its nature?
for it is not a matter that I can communicate to you.
Io.
Is it by a consort that he is to be ejected from his throne ?
PR.
Yes, surely, one that shall give birth to a son mightier than the father2.
Io.
And has he no refuge from this misfortune?
PR. Not he, indeed, before at any rate I after being libe­ rated from my shacklesIo.
Who then is he that shall liberate thee in despite of Jupiter?
PR.
It is ordained that it shall be one of thine own des­ cendants.
Io.
How sayest thou?
Shall child of mine release thee from thy ills :
?R.
Yes, the third of thy lineage in addition to ten other generations1.
Io.
This prophecy of thine is no longer easy for me to form a guess upon.
PR. Nor seek thou to know over well thine own pangs.
Io.
Do not after proffering me a benefit withhold it from me.
PR. I will freely grant thee one of two disclosures.
Io.
Explain to me first of what sort they are, and allow me my choice.
PR. I allow it thee ;
for choose whether I shall clearly tell to thee the residue of thy troubles, or who it is that is to be my deliverer.
CH.
Of these twain do thou vouchsafe to bestow the one boon on this damsel, and the other on me, and disdain thou not my request.
To her tell the rest of her wanderings, and to me him that is to deliver thee ;
for this I long [to hear].
PR. Seeing that ye are eagerly bent upon it, I will not oppose your wishes, so as not to utter every thing as much as ye desire.
To thee in the first place, Io, will I describe thy mazy wanderings, which do thou engrave on the recording tablets of thy mind.
When thou shalt have crossed the stream that is the boun­ dary of the Continents, to the ruddy realms of mom where walks the sun2 . . . . . . .
having passed over the roaring swell of the sea, until thou shalt reach the Gorgonian plains of Cisthene, where dwell the Phorcides, three swan­ like aged damsels, that possess one eye in common, that have but a single tooth, on whom ne'er doth the sun glance with his rays, nor the nightly moon.
And hard by are three winged sisters of these, the snake-tressed Gor­ gons, abhorred of mortals, whom none of human race can look upon and retain the breath of life3.
Such is this cau- dion' which I mention to thee.
Now lend an ear to another hideous spectacle;
for be on thy guard against the keen­ ranged hounds of Jupiter that never bark, the gryphons, and the cavalry host of one-eyed.
Arimasprans, who dwell on the banks of the gold-gushing fount, the stream of Pluto:
go not thou nigh to these.
And thou wilt reach a far-distant land, a dark tribe, who dwell close upon the fountains of the sun, where is the river Æthiops.
Along the banks of this wend thy way, until thou shalt have reached the cataract where from the Bybline mountains the Nile pours forth his hallowed, grateful stream.
This will guide thee to the trian­ gular land of the Nile;
where at length, To, it is ordained for thee and thy children after thee to found the distant colony.
And if aught of this is obscurely uttered, and hard to be un­ derstood, question me anew, and learn it thoroughly and clearly:
as for leisure, I have more than I desire.
On.
If indeed thou hast aught to tell of her baleful wan­ derings, that still remains or hath been omitted, say on;
but if thou hast told the whole, give to us in our turn the favour which we ask, and you, perchance, remember.
PR. She hath heard the full term of her journeying.
And that she may know that she bath not been listening to me in vain, I will relate what hardships she endured before she came hither, giving her this as a sure proof of my statements.
The very great multitude indeed of words I shall omit, and I will pro­ ceed to the termination itself of thine aberrations.
For aftei that thou hadst come to the Molossian plains, and about the lofty ridge of Dodona, where is the oracular seat of Thespro­ tian Jove, and a portent passing belief, the speaking oaks.
by which thou wast clearly and without any ambiguity saluted illustrious spouse of Jove that art to be;
if aught of this bath any charms for thee2.
Thence madly rushing along the sea­ side track, thou didst dart away to the vast bay of Rhea, from which thou art tempest-driven in retrograde courses:
and in time to come, know well that the gulf of the deep shall be called IO-nian, a memorial of thy passage to all mortals.
These hast thou as tokens of my intelligence, how that it per­ ceives somewhat beyond what appears.
The rest I shall tell both to you and to her in common, after reaching the very identical track of my former narrative.
There is on the land's utmost verge a city Canopus, hard by the Nile's very mouth and alluvial dyke;
on this spot Jupiter at length makes thee sane by merely soothing and touching thee with his unalarming hand.
And named after the progeni­ ture of Jupiter1 thou shalt give birth to swarthy Epaphus, who shall reap the harvest of all the land which the wide­ streaming Nile waters.
But fifth in descent from him a gene­ ration of fifty virgins shall again come to Argos, not of their own accord, fleeing from incestuous wedlock with their cousins;
and these with fluttering hearts, like falcons left not far be­ hind by doves, shall come pursuing marriage such as should not be pursued, but heaven shall be jealous over their persons2;
and Pelasgia shall receive them after being crushed by a deed of night-fenced daring, wrought by woman's hand;
for each bride shall bereave her respective husband of life, having dyed in their throats3 a sword of twin sharp edge.
Would that in guise like this Venus might visit my foes!
But tenderness shall soften one4 of the maidens, so that she shall not slay the partner of her couch.
but shall be blunt in her resolve;
and of the two alternatives she shall choose the former, to be called a coward rather than a murderess.
She in Argos shall give birth to a race of kings.
There needs a long discourse to detail these things distinctly ;
but from this seed be sure shall spring a dauntless warrior renowned in archery, who shall set me free from these toils.
Such predictions did my aged mother the Titaness Themis rehearse to me;
but how and when-to tell this requires a long detail, and thou in knowing it all wouldst be in nought a gainer.
Io.
Eleleu!
Eleleu!
Once more the spasm1 and madden­ in- phrenzies inflame me—and the sting of the hornet, wrought by no fire,2 envenoms me;
and with panic my heart throbs violently against my breast.
My eyes too are rolling in a mazy whirl, and I am carried out of my course by the raging blast of madness, having no controul of tongue, but my troubled words dash idly against the surges of loathsome cala­ mity.
Exit Io.
On.
Wise was the man, aye, wise indeed, who first weighed well this maxim, and with his tongue published it abroad, that to match in one’s own degree is best by far3 ;
and that one who lives by labour should woo the hand neither of any that have waxed wanton in opulence, nor of such as pride themselves on nobility of birth.
Never, 0 Destinies4, never ........ may ye behold me approaching as a partner the couch of Jupiter:
nor may I be3 brought to the arms of any bride­ groom from among the sons of heaven:
for I am in dread when I behold the maiden
Io, contented with no mortal lover, greatly marred by wearisome wanderings at the hand of Juno.
For myself, indeed-inasmuch as wedlock on one's own level is free from apprehension—I feel no alarm5.
And oh !
never may the love of the mightier gods cast on me a glance that none can elude.
This at least is a war without a conflict, accomplishing things impossible1:
nor know I what might become of me, for I see not how I could evade the counsel of Jove.
PR.
Yet truly shall Jove, albeit he is self-willed in his temper, be lowly, in such2 wedlock is he prepared to wed, as shall hurl him out of his sovereignty and off his throne a forgotten thing;
and the curse of his father Saturn shall then at length find entire consummation, which he imprecated when he was deposed from his ancient throne.
From disasters such as these there is no one of the gods beside myself that can clearly disclose to him a way of escape.
I know this, and by what means.
Wherefore let him rest on in his presumption, putting confidence in his thunders aloft, brandishing in his hand a fire-breathing bolt.
For not one jot shall these suffice to save him from falling dishonoured in a downfall be­ yond endurance;
such an antagonist is he now with his own hands preparing against himself, a portent that shall baffle all resistance;
who shall invent a flame more potent than the lightning, and a mighty din that shall surpass the thunder;
and shall shiver the ocean trident, that earth-convulsing pest, the spear of Neptune.
And when he bath stumbled upon this mischief, he shall be taught how great is the difference between sovereignty and slavery.
CH.
Thou forsooth art boding against Jupiter the things thou wishest.
PR. Things that shall come to pass, and that I desire to boot.
CH.
And are we to expect that any one will get the mas­ tery of Jove?
PR. Aye, and pangs too yet harder to bear than these [of mine] shall he sustain.
CH.
And how is it that thou art not dismayed blurt­ ing out words such as these ?
PR.
Why at what should I be terrified to whom it is not destined to die.
CH.
Yet perchance he will provide for thee affliction more grievous than even this.
PR. Let him do it then, all is foreseen by me.
CH.
They that do homage to Adrasteia are wise.
PR. Do homage, make thy prayer, cringe to each ruler of the day.
1 care for Jove less than nothing;
let him do, let him lord it for this brief span, e'en as he list, for not long shall he rule over the gods.
But no more, for I descry Jove's courier close at hand, the menial of the new monarch:
beyond all [doubt"] he has come to announce to us some news.
Thee, the contriver, thee full of gall and bitterness, who sinned against the gods by bestowing their honours on creatures of a day, the thief of fire, I address.
The Sire commands thee to divulge of what nuptials it is that thou art vaunting, by means of which he is to be put down from his power.
And these things, moreover, without any kind of mystery, but each exactly as it is, do thou tell out;
and en­ tail not upon me, Prometheus, a double journey;
and thou perceivest that by such conduct Jove is not softened.
PR. High sounding, i'faith, aud full of haughtiness is thy speech, as beseems a lackey of the gods.
Young in years, ye are young in power1 ;
and ye fancy forsooth that ye dwell in a citadel impregnable against sorrow.
Have I not known two monarchs2 dethroned from it ?
And the third that now is ruler I shall also see expelled most foully and most quickly.
- Suem
I to thee in aught to be dismayed at, and to crouch math the new gods ?
Widely, aye altogether, do I come short [of sucl feelings].
But do thou hie thee back the way by which thou amest:
for not one tittle shalt thou learn of the matter on which thou questionest me.
MER.
Yet truly 'twas by such self-will even before now that thou didst bring thyself to such a calamitous mooring.
PR.
Be well assured that I would not barter my wretched plight for thy drudgery;
for better do I deem it to be a lackey to this rock, than to be born the confidential courier of father Jove.
Thus is it meet to repay insult in kind.
MER.
Thou seemest to revel in thy present state.
PR. Revel!
Would that I might see my foes thus revel­ ling, and among these I reckon thee.
MER.
What dost thou impute to me also any blame for thy mischances?
PR. In plain truth, I detest all the gods, as many of them as.
after having received benefits at my hands, are iniquitously visiting me with evils.
MER.
I hear thee raving with no slight disorder.
PR. Disordered I would be, if disorder it be to loathe one's foes.
MER.
Thou wouldst be beyond endurance, wert thou in prosperity.
MER.
This word of thine Jove knows not.
PRO.
Aye. but Time as he grows old teaches all things.
MER.
And yet verily thou knowest not yet how to be discreet.
PRO.
No i'faith, or I should not have held parley with thee, menial as thou art.
MER.
Thou seemest disposed to tell naught of the things which the sire desires.
PR. In sooth, being under obligation as I am to him, 'I bound to return his favour.
MER.
Thou floutest me, forsooth as if I were a boy.
PR. Why, art thou not a boy, and yet sillier than one, if thou lookest to obtain any information from me ?
There is no outrage nor artifice by which Jupiter shall bring me to utter this, before my torturing shackles shall have been loos­ cued.
Wherefore let his glowing lightning be hurled, and with the white feathered shower of snow, and thunderings beneath the earth let him confound and embroil the universe;
for naught of these things shall bend me so much as even to say by whom it is doomed that he shall be put down from his soveiMERConsider now whether this determination seems availing.
PR. Long since has this been considered and resolved.
MER.
Resorve, 0 vain one, resolve at length in considera­ tion of thy present sufferings to come to thy right senses.
PR.
Thou troublest me with thine admonitions as vainly as [thou mightest] a billow1.
Never let it enter your thoughts that I, affrighted by the purpose of Jupiter, shall become womanish, and shall importune the object whom I greatly loathe, with effeminate upliftings of my bands, to release me from these shackles :
I want much of that.
MER.
With all that I have said I seem to be speaking to no purpose :
for not one whit art thou melted or softened in thy heart by entreaties, but art champing the bit like a colt fresh yoked, and struggling against the reins.
But on the strength of an impotent scheme art thou thus violent;
for obstinacy in one not soundly wise, itself by itself availeth less than nothing.
And mark, if thou art not persuaded by my words, what a tempest and three-fold surge of ills, from which there is no escape, will come upon thee.
For in the first place the Sire will shiver this craggy cleft with thunder and the blaze of his bolt, and will overwhelm thy body, and a clasping arm of rock shall bear thee up.
And after thou shalt have passed through to its close a long space of time, thou shalt come back into the light!
and a winged hound of Jupiter, a blood-thirsting eagle, shall ravenously mangle thy huge lacerated frame, stealing upon thee an un­ bidden guest, and [tarrying] all the livelong day, and shalt banquet his fill on the black viands2 of thy liver.
To such labours look thou for no termination, until some god shall appear as a substitute in thy pangs, and shall be willing to go both to gloomy Hades, and to the murky depths around Tartarus.
Wherefore advise thee, since this is no fictitious vaunt, but uttered in great earnestness;
for the divine mouth knows not how to utter falsehood, but will bring every word to pass.
But do thou look around and reflect, and never for a moment deem pertinacity better than discretion.
CH.
To us indeed Mercury seems to propose no unsea­ sonable counsel;
for he bids thee to abandon thy recklessness, and seek out wise consideration.
Be persuaded;
for to a wise man 'tis disgraceful to err.PR.
To me already well aware of it hath this fellow urged his message;
but for a foe to suffer horribly at the hands of , foes is no indignity.
Wherefore let the doubly-pointed wreath of his fire be hurled at me, and æther be torn piece­ meal by thunder, and spasm of savage blasts;
and let the wind rock earth from her base, roots and all, and with stormy surge mingle in rough tide the billow of the deep and the paths of the stars ;
and fling my body into black Tartarus, with a whirl, in the stern eddies of necessity.
Yet by no possible means shall he visit me with death.
MER.
Resolutions and expressions, in truth, such as these of thine, one may bear from maniacs.
For in what point doth his fate fall short of insanity1 ?
What doth it abate from ravings ?
But do ye then at any rate, that sympathise with him in his sufferings, withdraw hence speedily some whither from this spot, lest the harsh bellowing of the thunder smite you with idiotcy.
CH. Utter and advise me to something else, in which too thou mayest prevail upon me ;
for in this, be sure, thou hast intruded a proposal not to be borne.
How is it that thou urgest me to practise baseness ?
Along with him here I am willing to endure what is destined, for I have learned to abhor traitors ;
and there is no evil, which I hold in greater abomination.
MER.
Well then, bear in mind the things of which I fore­ warn you :
and do not, when ye have been caught in the snares of Atè, throw the blame ou fortune, nor ever at any time say that Jove cast you into unforeseen calamity:
no indeed, but, ye your ownselves:
for well aware, and not on a sudden, nor in ignorance, will ye be entangled by your senselessness in an impervious net of Atè.
Exit MERCURY.PR.
And verily in deed and no longer in word doth the earth heave, and the roaring echo of thunder rolls bellowing by us;
and deep blazing wreaths of lightning are glaring, and hur­ ricanes whirl the dust;
and blasts of all the winds are leaping forth, shewing one against the other a strife of conflict gusts ;
and the firmament is embroiled with the deep1.
Such is this onslaught that is clearly coming upon me from Jove, a cause for terror.
0 dread majesty of my mother Earth, 0 æther that diffusest thy common light, thou beholdest the wrongs I suffer.

The Acropolis of Thebes.

TIME.
Early in the morning;
the length of the action can scarcely be fixed with absolute certainty.
It certainly did not exceed twelve hours.
The expedition of " the Seven " against Thebes is fixed by Sir I. Newton, B.C. 928.
Cf. his Chronology, p. 27.
Blair carries it as far back as B.C. 1225.
OLD TRANSLATOR.ETEOCLES.
Citizens of Cadmus !
it is fitting that he should speak things seasonable, who has the care of affairs on the poop of a state, managing the helm, not lulling his eyelids in slumber.
For if we succeed, the gods are the cause ;
but if, on the other hand, (which heaven forbid,) mischance should befall, Eteoeles alone would be much bruited through the city by the townsmen in strains clamorous and in wailings, of which may Jove prove righty called the Averter to the city of the Cadmæans1.
And now it behoves you—both him who still falls short of youth in its prime, and him who in point of age has passed his youth, nurturing the ample vigour of his frame and each that is in his prime2, as is best fitting— to succour the city, and the altars of your country's gods, so that their honours may never be obliterated;
your children too, and your motherland, most beloved nurse;
for she, taking fully on herself the whole trouble of your rearing, nurtured you when infants crawling on her kindly soil, for her trusty shield.
bearing citizens, that ye might be [trusty]1 for this service And, for the present indeed, up to this day, the deity inclines in our favour;
since to us now all this time beleaguered the war for the most part, by divine allotment, turns out well.
But now, as saith the seer, the feeder2 of birds, revolving in ear and thoughts, without the use of fire, the oracular birds with unerring art,-he, lord of such divining powers, declares that the main Achæan assault is this night proclaimed', and [that the Achæans ] attempt the city.
But haste ye all, both to the battlements and the gates of the tower-works;
On!
in full panoply throng the breast- works, and take your stations on the platforms of the towers, and, making stand at the outlets of the gates, be of good heart, nor be over-dismayed at the rabble of the aliens;
God will give a happy issue.
Moreover, I have also despatched scouts and observers of the army, who will not, I feel assured, loiter on their way ;
and when I have had intelligence from these, I shall, in no point, be surprised by stratagem.
MESSENGER.
Most gallant Eteocles!
sovereign of the Cadmæans, I have come bearing a clear account of the mat­ ters yonder, from the army;
and I myself am eye-witness of the facts.
For seven chieftains, impetuous leaders of battalions, cutting a bull's throat.
over an iron-rimmed shield5, and touch­ ing with their hands the gore of the bull, by oath have called to witness6 Mars, Enyo and Terror, that delights in blood­ shed, that either having wrought the demolition of our city they will make havoc of the town of the Cadmæans, or having fallen will steep this land of ours in gore.
Memorials too of themselves, to their parents at home, were they with their hands hanging in festoons1 at the car of Adrastus, dropping a tear, but no sound of complaint passed their lips2.
For their iron-hearted spirit glowing with valour was panting, as of lions that glare battle.
And the report of these my tidings is not retarded by sluggishness.
But I left them in the very act ot casting lots, that so each of them, obtaining his post by lot, might lead on his battalion to our gates.
—Where­ iore do thou with all speed marshal at the outlets of the gates the bravest men, the chosen of our city;
for already the host of Argives hard at hand armed cap-à-pié is in motion, is speeding onward, and white foam is staining the plain with :
ts drippings from the lungs of their chargers.
Do thou then, like the clever helmsman of a vessel, fence3 our city before the breath of Mars burst like a hurricane upon it, for the main­ land billow of their host is roaring.
-And for these measures do thou seize the very earliest opportunity;
for the sequel I will keep my eye a faithful watch by day, and thou, knowing from the clearness of my detail the movements of those with­ out, shalt be unscathed.
Exit MESSENGER.ET. 0 Jupiter!
and earth !
and ye tutelary deities !
and thou Curse, the mighty Erinnys of my sire !
do not, I pray, uproot with utter destruction from its very base, a prey to foe­ men, our city, which utters the language of Greece, and our native dwellings4.
Grant that they may never hold the free land and city of Cadmus in a yoke of slavery;
but be ye our strength,—nay, I trust that I am urging our common interests, for a state that is in prosperity honours the divinities1.
Exit ETEOCLES.CHORUS2.
I wail over our fearful, mighty woes !
the army is let loose, having quitted its camp, a mighty mounted host is streaming hitherward in advance3 the dust appear­ ing high in the air convinces me, a voiceless, clear, true messenger;
the noise of the clatter of their hoofs upon the plain4, reaching even to our couches, approaches my ears, is wafted on, and is rumbling like a resistless torrent lashing the mountain-side.
Alas!
alas!
Oh gods and goddesses, avert the rising horror ;
the white-bucklered5 well-appointed host is rushing on with a shout on the other side our walls, speed­ ing its way to the city.
Who then will rescue us, who then of gods and goddesses will aid us ?
Shall I then pros­ trate myself before the statues of the divinities ?
Oh ye blessed beings, seated on your glorious thrones, 'tis high time for us to cling to your statues-why do we deeply sighing delay?
Hear ye, or hear ye not, the clash of bucklers?
When, if not now, shall we set about the orison of the peplus1 and chaplets ?
I perceive a din, a crash of no single spear.
What wilt thou do ?
wilt thorn, 0 Mars, ancient guar­ dian of our soil, abandon thine own land ?
God of the golden helm, look upon, look upon the city which once thou didst hold well-beloved.
Tutelary gods of our country, behold2, behold this train of virgins suppliant to escape from slavery8, for around our city a surge of men with waving crests is rip­ pling, stirred by the blasts of Mars.
But, 0 Jove.
sire all­ perfect!
avert thoroughly from us capture by the foemen ;
for Argives are encircling the fortress of Cadmus;
and I feel & dread of martial arms, and the bits which are fastened through the jaws of their horses are knelling slaughter.
And seven leaders of the host, conspicuous in their spear-proof harness, are taking their stand at our seventh gate4., assigned their posts by lot.
Do thou too, 0 Jove-born power that delightest in battle, Pallas, become a saviour to our city;
and thou, equestrian monarch, sovereign of the main, with thy fish-smiting trident, O Neptune, grant a deliverance, a deliverance from our ter­ rors.
Do thou too, 0 Mars, alas!
alas !
guard the city which is named after Cadmus, and manifestly shew thy care;
-and thou, Venus, the original mother of our race, avert [these ills] -for from thy blood are we sprung;
calling on thee with heaven-ward orisons do we approach thee.
-And thou Ly­ cæan king-be thou fierce as a wolf to the hostile army, [moved] by the voice of our sighs1.
Thou too, virgin-daughter of Latona, deftly adorn thyself with thy bow, 0 beloved Diana.
Ah!
ah !
ah !
I hear the rumbling of cars around the city, 0 revered Juno, the naves of the heavy-laden axles creak, the air is maddened with the wizzing of javelins­ what is our city undergoing ?
What will become of it ?
To what point is the deity conducting the issue2 ?
ah!
ah!
A shower of stones too from their slingers is coming over our battlements.
0 beloved Apollo!
there is the clash of brass- rimmed shields at the gates, and the just issue in battle must be decided by arms according to the disposal of Jove3.
And thou Onca4, immortal queen, that dwellest in front of our city, rescue thy seven-gated seat.
0 gods, all-potent to save, 0 ye gods and goddesses, perfect guardians of the towers of this laud, abandon not our war-wasted city to an army of aliens.
Listen to these virgins, listen to our all-just prayers, as is most right.
to the orisons of virgins which are offered with out-stretched hands.
0 beloved divinities, hovering around our city as its deliverers, show how ye love it;
give heed to our public rituals, and when ye give heed to them succour us, and be ye truly mindful, I beseech ye, of the rites of our city which abound in sacrifices.
Intolerable creatures!
is this, I ask you, best and salutary for our city, and an encouragement to this beleaguered force, for you to fall before the statues of our tutelary gods, to shriek, to yell—O ye abominations of the wise.
Neither in woes nor in welcome prosperity may I be associated with woman-kind;
for when woman prevails, her audacity is more than one can live with;
and when she is affrighted, she is a still greater mischief to her home and city.
Even now, having brought upou your countrymen this pell-mell flight, ye have, by your outcries, spread dastard cowardice, and ye are serving, as best ye may, the interests of those without, but we within our walls are suffering capture at our own hands ;
—such blessings will you have if you live along with women.
Wherefore if any one give not ear to my authority, be it man or woman, or other between [these names1,] the fatal pebble shall decide against him, and by no means shall he escape the doom of stoning at the hand of the populace.
For what pass­ eth without is a man's concern, let not woman offer advice -but remaining within do thou occasion no mischief.
Heard'st thou, or heard'st thou not, or am I speaking to a deaf woman ?
On.
0 dear son of Œdipus, I felt terror when I heard the din from the clatter if the ears, when the wheel-whirling naves rattled, and [tl e dim] of the fire-wrought bits, the rudders2 of the horses, passing through their mouths that know no rest.
ET.
What then ?
does the mariner who flees from the stern to the prow3 find means of escape, when his bark is labour­ ing against the billow of the ocean ?
CH.
No;
but I came in haste to the ancient statues of the divinities, trusting in the gods, when there was a pattering at our gates of destructive sleet showering down, even then I was carried away by terror to offer my supplications to the Immortals, that they would extend their protection over the city.
ET. Pray that our fortification may resist the hostile spear.
CH.
Shall not this, then, be at the disposal of the gods ?
ET.
Aye, but 'tis said that the gods of the captured city abandon it.
CH.
At no time during my life may this conclave of gods abandon us:
never may I behold our city overrun, and an army firing it with hostile flame.
ET. DO not thou, invoking the gods, take ill counsel ;
-for subordination, woman, is the mother of saving success;
so the adage runs.
On.
But the gods have a power superior still, and oft in adversity does this raise the helpless out of severe calamity, when clouds are overhanging his brow.
ET.
It is the business of men, to present victims and offer­ ings of worship to the gods, when foemen are making an attempt:
'tis thine on the other hand to hold thy peace and abide within doors.
On.
'Tis by the blessing of the gods that we inhabit a city unconquered.
and that our fortification is proof against the multitude of our enemies.
What Nemesis can feel offended at this ?ET.
I am not offended that ye should honour the race of the gods;
but that thou mayest not render the citizens faint-hearted, keep quiet and yield not to excessive terrors.
CH.
When I heard the sudden din, I came.
on the very instant, in distracting panic to this Acropolis, a hallowed seat.
ET.
Do not now, if ye hear of the dying or the wounded, eagerly receive them with shrieks ;
for with this slaughter of mortals is Mars fed.
CH.
And I do in truth bear the snortings of the horses.
ET.
Do not now, when thou hearest them, hear too dis­ tinetly.
CH.
Our city groans from the ground, as though the foes were hemming her in.
ET. IS it not then enough that I take measures for this ?
CH.
I fear!
for the battering at the gates increases.
ET.
Wilt thou not be silent ?
Say nought of this kind in the city.
CH. 0 associate band [of gods], abandon not our towers.
ET. Cannot ye endure it in silence, and confusion to ye ?
On.
Gods of my city!
let me not meet with slavery.
ET.
Thou thyself art making a slave both of me, of thyself, and of the city.
CH. 0 all-potent Jove !
turn the shaft against our foes.
ET. 0 Jove? what a race hast thou made women !
CR.
Just as wretched as men when their city is taken.
ET. Again thou art yelping as thou claspest the statues!
CH.
Yes, for in my panic terror hurries away my tongue.
ET. Would to heaven that you would grant me a trifling favour on my requesting it.
CH.
Tell me as quickly as you can, and I shall know at once.
ET. Hold thy peace, wretched woman, alarm not thy friends.
CH. I hold my peace-with others I will suffer what is des­ tined.
ET. I prefer this expression of thine rather than thy former words;
and moreover, coming forth from the sta­ tues, pray thou for the best,-that the gods may be our allies.
And after thou hasc listened to my prayers, then do thou raise the sacred auspicious shout of the Pæan, the Grecian rite of sacrificial acclamation, an encouragement to thy friends that removes the fear of the foe.
And I, to the tutelary gods of our land, both those who haunt the plains, and those who watch over the forum, and to the fountains of Dirce, and I speak not without those of the Ismenus1, if things turn out well and our city is preserved, do thus make my vows that we, dyeing the altars of the gods with the blood of sheep, offering bulls to the gods, will deposit trophies, and vestments of our enemies, spear-won spoils of the foe, in their hallowed abodes.
Offer thou pray­ ers like these to the gods, not with a number of sighs, nor with foolish and wild sobbings;
for not one whit the more wilt thou escape Destiny.
But I too, forsooth2, will go and marshal at the seven outlets of our walls, six men, with my­ self for a seventh, antagonists to our foes in gallant plight, before both urgent messengers and quickly-bruited tidings arrive, and inflame us by the crisis.
[Exit ETEOCLES.CH.
I attend, but through terror my heart sleeps not, and cares that press close upon my heart keep my dread alive, because of the host that hems our walls3 around;
like asdove, an all-attentive nurse, fears, on behalf of her brood, serpents evil intruders into her nest.
For some are advancing against the towers in all their numbers, in all their array;
(what will become of me ?) and others are launching the vast rugged stone at the citizens, who are assailed on all sides.
By every means, 0 ye Jove-descended gods!
rescue the city and the army that spring from Cadmus.
What better plain of land will ye take in exchange to yourselves than this, after ye have abandoned to our enemies the fertile land, and Dirce's water best fed of all the streams that earth-encircling Nep­ tune sends forth, and the daughters of Tethys?
Wherefore, 0 tutelary gods of the city!
having hurled on those without the towers the calamity that slaughters men, and casts away shields, achieve glory for these citizens, and be your statues placed on noble sites, as deliverers of our city1, through our entreaties fraught with shrill groanings.
For sad it is to send prematurely to destruction an ancient city, a prey of slavery to the spear, ingloriously overthrown in crumbling ashes by an Achæan according to the will of heaven;
and for its women to be dragged away captives, alas !
alas !
both the young and the aged, like horses by their hair, while their vestments are rent about their persons.
And the emptied city cries aloud, while its booty is wasted amid confused clamours ;
—verily I fearfully forebode heavy calamities.
And a mournful thing it is for [maidens] just marriageable2, before the celebration of rites for cull­ ing the fresh flower of their virginity, to have to traverse a hateful journey from their homes.
What?
I pronounce that the dead fares better than these;
for full many are the calamities, alas!
alas!
which a city undergoes when it has been reduced.
One drags anothers, slaughters, and to parts he sets fire—the whole city is defiled with smoke, and raving Mars that tramples down the nations, violating piety, inspires them.
Throughout the town are uproars, against the city rises the turreted eireumvallation1, and man is slain by man with the spear.
And the cries of children at the breast all bloody resound, and there is rapine sister of pell-mell confusion.
Pillager meets pillager, and the empty-handed shouts to the empty-handed, wishing to have a partner, greedy for a portion that shall be neither less nor equal.
What of these things can speech picture ?
Fruits of every possible kind strewn2 upon the ground occasion sor­ row, and dismal is the face of the stewards.
And full many a gift of earth is swept along in the worthless streams, in undistinguished medley.
And young female slaves have new sorrows, a foe being superior3, and fortunate as to their wretched captive couch, so that they hope for life's gloomy close to come, a guardian against their all-mournful sorrows.
SEMI-CH.
The scout, methinks, my friends, is bringing us some fresh tidings from the army, urging in naste the for­ warding axles4 of his feet.
SEMI-CH.
Aye, and in very truth here comes our prince, son of Œdipus, very opportunely for learning the messenger's report,-and haste does not allow him to make equal foot­ steps6.
MES.
I would fain tell, for I know them well, the arrange­ ments of our adversaries, and how each has obtained his lot at our gates.
Tydeus now for some time has been raging hard by the gate of Prœtus :
but the seer allows him not to cross the stream of Ismenus, for the sacrifices are not auspicious.
So Tydeus, raving and greedy for the fight, roars like a ser­ pent in its hissings beneath the noontide heat, and he smites the sage seer, son of Oïcleus, with a taunt, [saying] that he is crouching to both Death and Battle out of cowardice.
Shout­ ing out such words as these, he shakes there shadowy crests, the hairy honours of his helm, while beneath his buckler bells cast in brass are shrilly pealing terror:
on his buckler too he has this arrogant device,-a gleaming sky tricked out with stars, and in the centre of the shield a brilliant full moon is conspicuous, most august of the heavenly bodies, the eye of night.
Chafing thus in his vaunting harness, he roars beside the bank of the river, enamoured of conflict, like a steed champing his bit with rage, that rushes forth when he hears the voice of the trumpet1.
Whom wilt thou marshal against this [foe] ?
Who, when the fastenings give way, is fit to be intrusted with the defence of the gate of Prcetus ?ET.
At no possible array of a man should I tremble;
and blazonry has no power of inflicting wounds, and crests and bell bite not2 without the spear.
And for this night which thou tellest me is sparkling on his buckler with the stars of heaven, it may perchance be a prophet in conceit3;
for if night shall settle on his eyes as he is dying, verily this vaunting device would correctly and justly answer to its name, and he himself will have made the insolence ominous against himself.
But against Tydeus will I marshal this wary son of Astacus, as defender of the portals, full nobly born, and one that reverences the throne of Modesty, and detests too haughty language, for he is wont to be slow at base acts, but no dastard.
And from the sown heroes whom Mars spared is Melanippus sprung a scion, and he is thoroughly a native.
But the event Mars with his dice will decide.
And justice, his near kinswoman, makes him her champion1, that he may ward off the foeman's spear from the mother that bare him.
CH.
Now may the gods grant unto our champion to be successful, since with justice' does he speed forth in defence of the city;
but I shudder to behold the sanguinary fate of those who perish in behalf of their friends.
MES.
To him may the gods so grant success.
--But Ca­ paneus has by lot obtained his station against the Electran gate.
This is a giant, greater than the other aforemen­ tioned, and his vaunt savours not of humanity;
but he threatens horrors against our towers, which may fortune not bring to pass!
for he declares, that whether the god is willing or unwilling, he will make havoc of our city, and that not the Wrath3 of Jove, dashing down upon the plain, should stop him.
And he is wont to compare both the lightnings and the thunder-bolts to the heat of noontide.
He has a bearing too, a naked man bearing fire, and there gleams a torch with which his hands are armed4;
—and, in letters of gold, he is uttering, I WILL BURN THE CITY.
Against a man such as this do thou send5
Who will engage with him ?
Who will abide his vaunting and not tremble ?
ET.
And in this case6 also one advantage is gained upon another.
Of the vain conceits of man in sooth the tongue of truth becomes accuser.
But Capaneus is menacing, pre­ pared for action, dishonouring the gods, and practising his tongue in vain exultation;
—mortal as he is, he is sending loud swelling words into heaven to the ears of Jove.
But I trust that, as he well deserves, the fire-bearing thunderbolt will with justice come upon him, in no wise likened to the noontide warmth of the sun.
Yet against him, albeit he is a very violent blusterer, is a hero marshalled, fiery in his spirit, stout Polyphontes, a trusty guard by the favor of Diana, our protectress, and of the other gods.
Mention another who bath had his station fixed at another of our gates,CH.
May he perish1 who proudly vaunts against our city, and may the thunder-bolt check him before that he burst into my abode, or ever, with his insolent spear force us away from our maiden dwellings.
MES.
And verily I will mention him that, hath next had his post allotted him against our gates :
-for to Eteoclus, third in order, hath the third lot leapt from the inverted helm of glittering brass, for him to advance his battalion against, the gates of Neïs;
and he is wheeling his steeds fuming in their trappings, eager to dash forward against the gates.
And their snaffles ring, in barbarian fashion, filled with the breath of their snorting nostrils.
His buckler, too, hath been blazoned in no paltry style, but a man in armour is treading the steps of a ladder to his foemen's tower, seeking to storm it.
And this man, in a combination of letters, is shouting, how that not even Mars should force him from the bulwarks.-
Do thou send also to this man a worthy champion to ward off from this city the servile yoke.
ET. I will send this man forthwith, and may it be with good fortune ;
and verily he is sent, bearing his boast in deed2, Megareus, the offspring of Creon, of the race of the sown3;
who will go forth from the gates not a whit terrified at the noise of the mad snortings of the horses ;
but, either by his fall will fully pay the debt of his nurture to the land, or, having taken two men1 and the city on the shield, will garnish with the spoils the house of his father.
Vaunt thee of another, and spare me not the recital.
CH.
I pray that this side may succeed, 0 champion of my dwellings!
and that with them it may go ill;
and as they, with frenzied mind, utter exceedingly proud vaunts against our city, so may Jove the avenger regard them in his wrath.
MES.
Another, the fourth, who occupies the adjoining gates of Onea Minerva, stands hard by with a shout, the shape and mighty mould of Hippomedon ;
and I shuddered at him as he whirled the immense orb, I mean the circumference of his buekler—I will not deny it.
And assuredly it was not any mean artificer in heraldry who produced this work upon his buckler, a Typhon, darting forth through his fire-breathing mouth dark smoke, the quivering sister of fire, and the circular cavity of the hollow-bellied shield hath been made further solid with coils of serpents.
He himself, too, bath raised the war-cry ;
and possessed by Mars, raves for the onslaught, like a Thyiad2, glaring terror.
Well must we guard against the attack of such a man as this, for Terror is already vaunting himself hard by our gates.
ET.
In the first place, this Onca Pallas, who dwells in our suburbs, living near the gates, detesting the insolence of the man, will drive him off, as a noxious serpent from her young.
And Hyperbius, worthy son of CEnops, bath been chosen to oppose him.
man to man.
willing to essay his des­ tiny in the crisis of fortune;
he is open to censure neither in form, nor in spirit, nor in array of arm:
but Mercury hath matched them fairly;
for hostile is the man to the man with whom he will have to combat, and on their bucklers will they bring into conflict hostile gods;
for the one bath fire-breathing Typhon, and on the buckler of Hyperbius father Jove is seated firm, flashing, with his bolt in his hand;
and never yet did any one know of Jove being by any ehance vanquished3.
Such in good sooth is the friendship of the divinities:
we are on the side of the victors, but they on that of the conquered, if at least Jove be mightier in battle than Typhon.
Where­ fore 'tis probable that the combatahts will fare accordingly;
and to Hyperbius, in accordance with his blazonry, may Jove that is on his shield become a saviour.
CH.
1 feel confident that he who hath upon his shield the adversary of Jove, the hateful form of the subterranean fiend, a semblance hateful both to mortals and the everliving gods.
will have to leave his head before our gates.
MES.
May such be the issue!
But, furthermore, I mention the fifth, marshalled at the fifth gate, that of Boreas, by the very tomb of Jove-born Amphion.
And he makes oath by the spear1 which he grasps, daring to revere it more than a god, and more dearly than his eyes2, that verily he will make havoc of the city of the Cadmæans in spite of Jove:
thus says the fair-faced scion of a mountain-dwelling mother, a stripling hero, and the down is just making its way through his cheeks, in the spring of his prime, thick sprouting hair.
And he takes his post, having a ruthless spirit, not an­ swering to his maidenly name3, and a savage aspect.
Yet not without his vaunt does he take stand against our gates, for on his brazen-forged shield the rounded bulwark of his body, he was wielding the reproach of our city, the Sphinx of ruthless maw affixed by means of studs, a gleaming embossed form;
and under her she holds a man, one of the Cadmæans, so that against this man1 most shafts are hurled.
And he, a youth, Parthenopæus an Arcadian, seems to have come to fight in no short measure2, and not to disgrace the length of way that he has traversed:
for this man, such as he is, is a sojourner.
and, by way of fully repaying Argos for the goodly nurture she has given him, he utters against these towers menaces, which may the deity not fulfil.
ET. 0 may they receive from the gods the things which they are purposing in those very unhallowed vaunts!
Assu­ redly they would perish most miserably in utter destruction.
But there is [provided] for this man also, the Arcadian of whom you speak, a man that is no braggart, but his hand discerns what should be done, Actor, brother of the one afore­ mentioned, who will not allow either a tongue, without deeds, streaming within our gates, to aggravate mischiefs, nor him to make his way within who bears upon his hostile buckler the image of the wild beast, most odious monster, which from the outside shall find fault with him who bears it within, when it meets with a thick battering under the city.
-So, please the gods, may I be speaking the truth.
CH.
The tale pierces my bosom, the locks of my hair stand erect, when I hear of the big words of these proudly-vaunting impious men.
Oh!
would that the gods would destroy them in the land.
MES.
I will tell of the sixth, a man most prudent, and in valour the best, the seer, the mighty Amphiaraus:
for he, having been marshalled against the gate of Homolois, reviles mighty Tydeus full oft with reproaches, as the homicide, the troubler of the state, chief teacher of the mischiefs of Argos, the summoner of Erinnys, minister of slaughter, and adviser of these mischiefs to Adrastus.
Then again going up3 to thy brother, the mighty Polynices, he casts his eye aloft, and, at last.
reproachfully dividing his name [into syllables1,] he calls to him:
and through his mouth he gives utterance to this speech —" Verily such a deed is well-pleasing to the gods, and glorious to hear of and to tell in after times, that you are making havoc of your paternal city, and its native gods, having brought into it a foreign armament.
And what Justice shall staunch the fountain of thy mother's tears?
And how can thy father-land, after having been taken by the spear through thy means, ever be an ally to thee?
I, for my part, in very truth shall fatten this soil, seer as I am, buried beneath a hostile earth.
Let us to the battle, I look not for a dishonourable fall."
Thus spake the seer, wielding a fair-orbed shield, all of brass;
but no device was on its circle,-for he wishes not to seem but to be righteous, reaping fruit from a deep furrow in his mind, from which sprout forth his goodly counsels.
Against this champion I advise that thou send antagonists, both wise and good.
A dread adversary is he that reveres the gods.
ET. Alas!
for the omen2 that associates a righteous man with the impious !-Indeed in every matter, nothing is worse than evil fellowship-the field of infatuation has death for its fruits3.
For whether it be that a pious man hath embarked in a vessel along with violent sailors, and some vil­ lany, he perishes with the race of men abhorred of heaven;
or, being righteous, and having rightly fallen into the same toils with his countrymen, violators of hospitality, and un­ mindful of the gods, he is beaten down, smitten with the scourge of the deity, which falls alike on all.
Now this seer, I mean the son of Oïcleus, a moderate, just, good, and pious man, a mighty prophet, associated with unholy bold-mouthed men, in spite of his [better] judgment, when they made their long march, by the favour of Jove, shall be drawn along with them to go to the distant city..
I fancy, indeed, that he will not make an attack on our gates, not as wanting spirit, nor from cowardice of disposition, but he knows that it is his doom to fall in battle, if there is to be any fruit in the oracles of Apollo:
'tis his wont too to hold his peace, or to speak what is seasonable.
Nevertheless against him we will mar­ shal a man, mighty Lasthenes, a porter surly to strangers, and who bears an aged mind, but a youthful form;
quick is his eye, and he is not slow of hand to snatch his spear made naked from his left hand2.
But for mortals to succeed is a boon of the deity.
CH. 0 ye gods, give car to our righteous supplications, and graciously bring it to pass that our city may be successful, while ye turn the hori ors wrought by the spear upon the inva­ ders of our country :
and may Jove, having flung them [to a distance] from our towers, slay them with his thunderbolt.
MES.
Now will I mention this the seventh, against the seventh gate, thine own brother-what calamities too he impre­ cates and prays for against our city;
-that, he having scaled the towers, and been proclaimed3 to the land, after having shouted out the paean of triumph at the capture, may engage with thee;
and, having slain thee, may die beside thee, or avenge him­ self on thee alive, that dishonoured, that banished him4, by exile after the very same manner.
Thus does mighty Poly­ nices clamour, and he summons the gods of his race and fatherland to regard his supplications.
He has, moreover, a newly-constructed shield, well suited [to his arm,] and a double device wrought upon it.
-For a woman is leading on a mailed warrior, forged out of brass, conducting him decorously;
and so she professes to be Justice, as the inscription tells.—I WILL BRING BACK THIS MAN, AND HE SHALL HAVE THE CITY OF HIS FATHERS, AND A DWELLING IN THE PALACE.
Such are their devices;
and do thou thyself now determine whom it is that thou thinkest proper to send:
since never at any time shalt thou censure me for my tidings;
but do thou thyself determine the management of the vessel of the state.
ET. 0 heaven-phrenzied, and great abomination of the gods!
—Oh!
for our race of Œdipus, worthy of all mourning -Alas for me!
now verily are the curses of my sire coming to an accomplishment.
But it becomes me not to weep or wail, lest birth be given to a lament yet more intolerable.
But to Polynices, that well deserves his name, I say, soon shall we know what issue his blazonry will have;
whether letters wrought in gold, vainly vaunting on his buckler, along with phrenzy of soul will restore him.
If indeed Justice, the virgin daughter of Jove, attended on his actions or his thoughts, perchance this might be.
But neither when he escape the dark­ ness of the womb, nor in his infancy, nor ever in his boyhood, nor in the gathering of the hair on his chin, did Justice look on him, or deem him worthy her regards:
nor truly do I suppose that she will now take her stand near to him, in his ill-omened possession of his father-land.
Truly she would then in all reason be falsely called Justice, were she to consort with a man all-daring in his soul.
Trusting in this I will go, and face him in person.
Who else could do so with better right?
Leader against leader, brother against brother, foeman with foeman, shall I take my stand.
Bring me with all speed my greaves, my spear, and my armour of defence against the stones.
Exit MESSENGER.CH.
Do not, 0 dearest of men, son of Œdipus, become in wrath like to him against whom thou hast most bitterly spoken.
-Enough it is that Cadmæans come to the encounter with Argives.
For such bloodshed admits of expiation.
But the death of own brothers thus mutually wrought by their own hands-of this pollution there is no decay.

So fierce a biting lust for unlawful blood hurries thee on to perpetrate the shedding of a man's blood, of which the fruit is bitter1.

Aye, for the hateful curse of my dear father, con­ summated, sits hard beside me with dry tearless eyes, telling me that profit comes before my after doom2.
CH.
But do not accelerate it;
thou wilt not be called das­ tardly if thou honourably preservest thy life-and Erinnys3, with her murky tempest, enters not the dwelling where the gods receive a sacrifice from the hands [of the inmates].

By the gods, indeed, we have now for some time been in a manner neglected, and the pleasure which arises from our destruction is welcomed by them;
why should we any longer fawn4 upon our deadly doom?
On.
Do so now, whilst it is in thy power;
since the daemon, that may alter with a distant shifting of his temper, will per­ chance come with a gentler air;
but now he still rages.

I shudder with dread that the power that lays waste this house, not like the gods, the all-true, the evil-boding Erinnys summoned by the curses of the father, is bringing to a consummation the wrathful curses of distracted Œdipus1.
'Tis this quarrel, fatal to his sons, that arouses her.
And the Chalybian stranger, emigrant from Scythia, is appor­ tioning their shares, a fell divider of possessions, the stern- hearted steel2, allotting them land to occupy, just as much as it may be theirs to possess when dead, bereft of their large domains8.
When they shall have fallen, slain by each other's hands in mutual slaughter, and the dust of the ground shall have drunk up the black-clotted blood of murder, who will furnish expiation?
who will purify them?
Alas for the fresh troubles mingled with the ancient horrors of this family!
for I speak of the ancient transgression with its speedy punishment;
yet it abides unto the third generation:
since Laius, in spite of Apollo, who had thrice declared, in the central oracles of Pytho, that, dying without issue, he would save the state4, did, notwithstanding, overcome by his friends, in his infatuation beget his own destruction, the parricide CEdipus, who dared to plant in an unhal­ lowed field, where he had been reared, a bloody root.—
'Twas phrenzy linked the distracted pair;
and as it were a sea of troubles brings on one billow that subsides, and rears another triply cloven, which too dashes about the stern of our state.
But between [it and us] there stretches a fence at a small interval, a tower in width alone1.
And I fear lest the city should be overcome along with its princes.
For the execrations, that were uttered long ago, are finding their accomplishment:
bitter is the settlement, and deadly things in their consummation pass not away.
The wealth of enter­ prising merchants2, too thickly stowed, brings with it a easting overboard from the stern.
For whom of mortals did the gods, and his fellow-inmates in the city, and the many lives of herding men3, admire so much as they then honoured CEdi­ pus, who had banished from the realm the baneful pest that made men her prey.
But when he unhappy was apprised of his wretched marriage, despairing in his sorrow, with phrenzied heart he perpetrated a twofold horror;
he de­ prived himself with parricidal hand of the eyes that were more precious than his children.
And indignant because of his scanty supply of food*, he sent upon his sons, alas!
alas!
a curse horrible in utterance, even that they should some time or other, share his substance between them with sword-wielding hand;
and now I tremble lest the swift Erinnys should be on the point of fulfilling that prayer.
Be of good cheer, maidens that have been nurtured by your mothers5.
This city hath escaped the yoke of servitude ;
the vauntings of our mighty foes have fallen;
and our city is calm, and hath not admitted a leak from the many buffets of the surge;
our fortification too stands proof, and we have fenced our gates with champions fighting single-handed, and bring­ ing surety;
-for the most part, at six of our gates, it is well;
but the seventh the revered lord of the seventh, sovereign Apollo, chose for himself, bringing to a consummation the ancient indiscretions of Laïus.

The impreca­ tion of the father hath taken full effect, and hath not failed :
and the unbelieving schemes of Laïus have lasted even until now;
-and care is through our city, and the divine declara­ tions lose not their edge-Alas!
worthy of many a sigh, ye have accomplished this horror surpassing credence ;
and lamentable sufferings have come in deed.
This is self­ evident, the tale of the messenger is before my eyes-Double are our sorrows, double are the horrors of them that have fallen by mutual slaughter;

But, my friends, ply the speeding stroke of your hands about your heads, before the gale of sighs, which ever wafts on its passage, the bark, on which no sighs are heard, with sable sails, the freighted with the dead, untrodden for Apollo, the sunless, across Acheron, and to the invisible all-receiving shore4.
But [enough] !
for here are coming to this bitter office both Antigone and Ismene.
I am assured beyond all doubt that they will send forth a fitting wail from their lovely deep-cinc­ tured bosoms.

We may say too of these happy men that they both wrought many mischiefs to their countrymen, and to the ranks of all the strangers, that perished in great numbers in battle.
SEMI-CH.
Ill-fated was she that bare them before all women, as many as are mothers of children.
Having taken to herself her own son for a husband, she brought forth these, and they have ended their existence thus by fraternal hands that dealt mutual slaughter.
SEMI-CH. Fraternal in very truth!
and utterly undone were they by a severing in no wise amicable, by phrenzied strife at the consummation of their feud.
SEMI-CH.
But their enmity is terminated:
and in the reeking earth is their life-blood mingled, and truly are they of the same blood.
A bitter arbiter of strife is the stranger from beyond the sea, the whetted steel that bounded forth from the fire;
and bitter is the horrible distributer of their substance, Mars, who bath brought the curse of their father truly to its consummation.
SEMI-CH. Hapless youths!
They have obtained their portion of heaven-awarded woes, and beneath their bodies shall be a fathomless wealth of earthy Alas!
ye that have made your houses bloom with many troubles!
And at its fall these Curses raised the shout of triumph in shrill strain, when the race had been put to flight in total rout;
a trophy of Atè has been reared at the gate at which they smote each other, and, having overcome both, the dæmon rested.

a woe fit to sleep beside my father1,'Tis my duty to announce the good pleasure and the decree of the senators of the people of this city of Cadmus.
It is resolved to bury this body of Eteocles for his attachment to his country, with the dear interment in earth!
for in repelling our foes he met death in the city, and being pure in respect to the sacred rites of his country, blameless hath he fallen where 'tis glorious for the young to fall;
thus, indeed, hath it been commissioned me to announce concerning this corpse:
But Fit has been decreed] to cast out unburied, a prey for dogs, this the corpse of his brother Polynices, inasmuch as he would have been the overturner of the land of Cadmus, if some one of the gods had not stood in opposition to his spear:
and even now that he is dead, he will lie under the guilt of pollution with the gods of his country, whom he having dis­ honoured was for taking the city by bringing against it a foreign host.
So it is resolved that he, having been buried dishonourably by winged fowls, should receive his recompense, and that neither piling up by hands of the mound over his tomb should follow, nor any one honour him with shrill-voiced wailings, but that he be ungraced with a funeral at the hands of his friends.
Such is the decree of the magistracy of the Cadmæans.
ANT.
But I say to the rulers of the Cadmæans, if not another single person is willing to take part with me in burying him, I will bury him, and will expose myself1 to peril by burying my brother.
And I feel no shame at being guilty of this disobedient insubordination against the city.
Powerful is the tie of the common womb from which we sprung, from a wretched mother,* and a hapless sire.
Where­ fore, my soul, do thou, willing with the willing share in his woes, with the dead, thou living, with sisterly feeling—and nought shall lean-bellied wolves tear his flesh-let no one suppose it.
All woman though I be, I will contrive a tomb and deep-dug grave for him, bearing earth in the bosom-fold of my fine-linen robe, and I myself will cover him;
let none imagine the contrary:
an effective scheme shall aid my boldness.
HER.
I bid thee not to act despite the state in this matter.
ANT.
I bid thee not announce to me superfluous things.
HER, Yet stern is a people that has just escaped troubles.
ANT.
Aye, call it stern2,-yet this [corpse] shall not lie unburied.
HER.
What!
wilt thou honour with a tomb him whom our state abhors3 ?
ANT.
Heretofore he has not been honoured by the gods4HER.
Not so, at least before he put this realm in jeopardy.
ANT.
Having suffered injuriously he repaid with injury.
HER.
Aye, but this deed of his fell on all instead of one.
ANT.
Contention is the last of the gods to finish a dispute., and I will bury him;
make no more words.
HER.
Well, take thine own way-yet I forbid thee.
Exit HERALD.CH.
Alas !
alas!
0 ye fatal Furies, proudly triumphant, and destructive to this race, ye that have ruined the family of Œdipus from its root.
What will become of me ?
What shall I do ?
What can I devise ?
How shall I have the heart neither to bewail thee nor to escort thee to the tomb?
But I dread and shrink from the terror of the citizens.
Thou, at all events, shalt in sooth have many mourners;
but he, wretched one, departs unsigned for, having the solitary- wailing dirge of his sister.
Who will agree to this?
SEM.
Let the state do or not do aught to those who be­ wail Polynices.
We, on this side will go and join to escort his funeral procession;
for both this sorrow is common to the race, and the state at different times sanctions different maxims of justice.
SEM.
But we will go with this corpse, as both the city and justice join to sanction.
For next to the Immortals and the might of Jove, this man prevented the city of the Cadmæans from being destroyed, and thoroughly overwhelmed by the surge of foreign enemies.
THE ill-boding dream of Atossa is confirmed by a messenger from the Persian army, giving an account of the defeat at Salamis, and the shade of Darius, being invoked, denounces the mad folly of Xerxes, with whose lamentations, upon his disgraceful return, the play concludes.
CHORUS OF AGED PERSIANS.
ATOSSA, THE QUEEN-MOTHER.A MESSENGER.
THE GHOST OF DARIUS.
On.
These are the faithful band1 left by the Persians who have gone into the land of Hellas, and guardians of these opu­ lent abodes abounding in gold, whom our prince Xerxes himself, a monarch descended from Darius, selected according to senior­ ity, to have the superintendence of the realm.
And now for some time my ill-boding soul within me has been in a state of exceeding agitation concerning the return of our monarch, and of the army in its rich array, for the whole native power of Asia hath gone, and [my mind] calls for its youthful hero2.
And neither does any messenger nor any horseman arrive at the city of the Persians, who, having quitted the city of Susa and of Ecbatana1, and the antique Cissian fortress, set forth, some on steeds, some in ships, and the infantry in slow march, forming a dense file of war.
Amistres2, for instance, and Artaphrenes, and Mcgabayes, and Astaspes, leaders of the Persians, kings, subalterns of the great king, speed their way, inspectors of the great host, both those that conquer with the bow, and mounted upon steeds, fearful to look upon3, and ter­ rible in fight, through their stern determination of spirit.
Artembaces too, rejoicing in his charger, and Masistres, and stout Imæus that slays with the bow, and Pharandaces and Sos­ thanes, driver of steeds.
And others Nile, the mighty stream and nourisher of many, sent forth;
Susiscanes, Pegastagon native of Egypt, and the lord of sacred Memphis mighty Arsames, and Ariomardus ruler of ancient Thebes, and the dwellers in the fens, skilful rowers of galleys, and in multi­ tude beyond all numbering.
There follows a crowd of Lydians, delicate in their habits of life, and they that hold every nation native on the continent4, whom Mithragathes and valiant Arc­ teus, inspector-princes, and Sardis that teems with gold, send forth in many chariots, in ranks of double and treble yokes6, a spectacle fearful to look upon.
The borderers too on sacred Tmolus are bent on casting the yoke of servitude around Hellas, Mardon, Tharybis, [twin] anvils of the spear, and the Mysians who launch the javelin.
Babylon too, that teems with gold, sends forth her mingled multitude in long array, both those who embark in ships, and are trust in their valour to draw the bow.
And the scimitar-wielding populace from all Asia follows in their train, under the dread mandates of the king.
Sueh a flower of men is gone from the Persian land;
concerning whom the Asiatic soil which reared them is shrivelled with vehement anxiety:
and parents and wives, as they count the day, shudder at the lengthening date.
The royal armament that makes havoc of cities, hath some time sinee passed over to the adjoining opposite region, having crossed the frith of Helle daughter of Athamas1, on a cable­ fastened raft, after flinging a many-rivetted causeway by way of yoke over the neek of Ocean.
And against every land does the impetuous lord of many-peopled Asia urge forward his godlike armament in two divisions, of infantry, and of forces drawn from the sea, trusting in his strong sturdy commanders, a man equal to the gods of the raee that sprung from gold2.
And flashing from his eyes the dark-blue glare of the deadly serpent, appointed with many a warrior and many a mariner, and urging on his Syrian3 car, he is leading on a war victorious with the bow against men who are famous for the spear4.
And no one is of such approved prowess as that, having made stand against a mighty torrent of men, he ean repulse, by mighty bulwarks, the irresistible billow of the sea.
For terri­ ble to approach is the army of Persians, and valiant of soul the host.
But what mortal man shall elude the treacherous deceit of the deity?
Who is he that with an agile foot, of easy spring5, can bound over it ?
For fawning on him at first with kindly disposition it lures a man on within the densest toils, whence it is not possible for mortal to struggle out and make his escape.
For destiny, fixed by heaven, prevailed in the olden time, and enjoined on the Persians to carry on wars that beat down towers, and the tumults of cavalry war­ fare, and demolitions of cities.
They learned, too, to look upon the ocean fields of the wide-winding sea when it whitens with the violent blast, putting confidence in their slightly-con­ structed tackling, and the machines in which hosts are wafted [ across the deep].
By reason of these things my soul, wrapt in gloom, is torn by terror, alas!
for this army of the Persians!
lest the state should learn that the mighty city of the Susian district is drained of its warriors, and the fortress of the Cissians;
(the crowded assemblage of women uttering1 this word, alas!
will re-echo the strain,) and rending shall fall upon the finely­ woven vestments.
For all the host that drive the steed, and that tramp along the plain, bath gone off like a swarm of bees, along with the leader of the army, having crossed the ocean promontory common to both continents2, united to either side.
And through regret for their lords, the couches are filled with tears:
and the matrons of Persia in excessive grief, each one of them in tenderness for her lord, having sent off her fierce warrior consort, is left behind in solitude.
But come, Per­ sians, let us seat ourselves beneath in this ancient dwelling, and take wary and well-pondered care,-for the necessity has arrived-how haply fares our king Xerxes, offspring of Darius, being of the same ancestral race with us3.
Is it the drawing of the bow that prevails, or hath the.
might of the barbed spear got the mastery?
But here comes forth a light like to the eyes of gods, the mother of our sovereign, and my queen, I do lowly homage.
And fitting it is that we all address her with, words of salutation.
[Enter ATOSSA.]
0 queen, supreme of Persia's deep-waisted matrons, aged mother of Xerxes, hail to thee!
spouse to Darius, consort of the Per- sians' god, and mother of a god thou art, unless in some respect our ancient fortune hath forsaken our host.
AT.
For this reason, in truth, am I come, having left my gold-garnished mansion, the common bridal-dwelling both of Darius and of myself.
And anxiety is tearing me at heart:
and I will make a disclosure to you, my friends, being of my­ self by no means free from apprehension, lest mighty wealth, having made great speed, should, with his foot, overturn the wealth which Darius reared, not without the aid of some god.
These things are to my soul a two-fold unut­ terable care, not to honour with reverence a multitude of riches unprotected by men, and that the light shines not on those who are destitute of wealth, however great the strength which they may possess.
For our wealth at all events is beyond the reach of censure, but touching our eye' is my terrors.
For I deem the presence of the master the eye of an household.
Whereupon, since these things stand thus, lend me your counsel in this matter, ye aged trusty servants of the Persians.
For all my good measures depend on you.
CH.
Be well assured of this, 0 queen of this land, that thou needest not to speak twice of either word or deed, to which our ability can lead the way to completion.
For thou sum­ monest us who are well-affected to thee, as in these matters.
AT.
I have been continually haunted by many dreams in the night, ever since my son, having fitted forth his armament, went to the land of the Ionians, purposing to lay it waste.
But I never yet saw any so plain, as on the night just passed, -and I will tell it thee.
There seemed to appear before two women2 in fair attire-the one robed in Persian vestments, but the other in Doric, both in statue by far the most comely of those who live now-a-days, and in beauty beyond rebuke, and sisters of the same family.
And as to eountry-they inhabited, the one, having had it assigned to her by lot, the land of Hellas,-the other the barbarian3;
these two, as 1 fancied I saw, had a feud the one with the other:
and my ion, when he heard it, was checking and soothing them, and he yokes them beneath his car, and places a collar on their necks.
And the one towered loftily in these trappings, and had a tractable mouth in the reins:
but the other kept plunging, and tears in pieces with her hands the harness of the car, and whirls it violently along without the bit, and snaps the yoke in the middle:
and my son falls, and his sire Darius stands beside him, commiserating him ;
and when Xerxes sees him, he rends his robes about his person.
These things, indeed, I say that I beheld last night.
But when I had arisen, and had touched with my hands a fair-streaming fountain!, I stood by the altar, wishing to offer a sacrificial cake to the divinities that avert evil, to whom these rites belong.
And I behold an eagle fleeing to the altar of Phœbus;
and from terror I stood speechless, my friends, and afterwards I see a falcon speeding onward in his course with his pinions, and tearing his head with his talons.
And the eagle did nought but cower down and yield his body.
These sights are terrible for me to behold, and for you to hear.
For be ye well assured, my son, were he successful, would be a man worthy of admiration, and though he fail, he is not liable to be called to account by the state;
but if he escape, will equally be sovereign of this realm2.
On.
We wish not, 0 mother, either to terrify too much by our words, or to cheer thee;
but do thou, if thou hast seen aught disastrous, approach the gods with supplications, and implore of them to grant it may be averted, but that what is favourable may be accomplished for thyself, and for thy children, and for the city, and for all thy friends.
And in the second place it is proper that thou pour libations both to the earth and to the departed.
And gently make thy prayer that thy husband Darius, whom thou sayest thou didst see by night, would send good things for thee and for thy child, into the light of day from beneath the earth:
and that what is contrary to these, being detained beneath the earth, may fade away in gloom.
This advice have I given thee with kindly intent, auguring by my mind's judgment, And, touching these things, we judge that in all things there will come to thee a favourable issue.
AT.
Well certainly thou the first interpreter of these dreams of mine, with friendly disposition at least, towards my son and house, hast given confirmation to this.
And may what is good in very deed come to pass.
And all these things, as thou enjoin est, I will perform to the gods, and to those dear to me beneath the earth, after I shall have gone into the pa­ lace ;
but on those points, my friends, I wish to be thoroughly informed, in what part of the earth they say Athens is situated1 ?
CH.
Far hence, towards the west, where are the wanings of the sovereign sunAT.
What!
had my son then a desire to make this city his prey ?
CH.
Yes, for so all Hellas would be in subjection to the king.
AT.
Does so numerous a force belong to them ?
CH.
Aye, and such an army as in good truth wrought the Medes much mischief.
AT.
And what beside these things have they ?
Is there sufficient wealth in their dwellings?
CH.
They have a fountain of silver, a treasure of their soil.
AT.
Does the bow-stretching shaft display itself in their hands ?
CH.
Not at all.
They have spears for close fighting, and shield-guarded panoply.
AT.
And who is over them as their leader, and has the command of their army.
CH.
They are not called the slaves nor even the subjects of any man.
AT.
How then should they abide invading foemen ?
On.
So [well do they], that they destroyed a large and goodly army of Darius.
AT.
Truly thou tellest of what is dreadful for the parents of those who are gone to think upon.
CH.
But, as it seems to me, thou shalt soon know the whole truth ;
for the running of this man we may plainly per­ ceive to be that of a Persian;
and he is bringing some clear tidings of good or ill for us to hear.
O ye cities of the whole land of Asia!
0 realm of Persia, and mighty haven of opulence, how hath the ample weal been demolished by a single stroke, and the flower of the Persians is fallen and gone.
Woe's me, 'tis an ill office to be the first messenger of ill, but yet it is necessary to unfold the whole of the disaster of the Persians, for all the army of the barbarians hath perished.
CH. Dismal, dismal, strange evils, and adverse,-alas.
Drench yourselves in tears, ye Persians, hearing of this sorrow.
MES.
How has all that armament gone to ruin!
But I myself, beyond my hope, behold the day of my return.
CH.
Verily this life of ours appears too long protracted to us aged men, that we should hear of this unlooked-for cala­ mity.
MES.
And in very deed I, being on the spot, and not having heard reports from others!, can tell how great ills have been dealt out to the Persians.
CH. Woe! woe!
in vain did the multitude of shafts of every kind go from the land of Asia, against a hostile land, the realm of Hellas.
MES.
The shores of Salamis, and all the adjoining region, are full of the corpses of those who miserably perished.
On.
Woe! woe !
thou tellest us that the dead bodies of our friends, tossed on the billow, oft immersed, are borne along on the twice-changing surface of the tide2.
MES.
Yes, for our bows availed us nought, and our whole host perished, beaten down by the collision of the beaks of the vessels.
CH. Shriek forth a doleful outcry, full of woe to the wretched Persians;
for ill did they succeed in all things, alas 1 when their host was destroyed.
MES. 0 name of Salamis, most hateful to our ears.
Alas !
how I sigh when I remember Athens.CH.
Hateful is Athens to us miserable:
we have to re­ member, in sooth, how many of the Persian matrons it has made widows and bereft of their husbands to no gain of ours!
AT.
I, wretched, have for a long time kept silence, utterly astounded by the evils:
for this calamity is too great for me to speak, or to enquire about our sufferings.
Nevertheless, it is necessary for mortals to endure afflictions, when the gods award them :
and do thou compose thyself and tell us, unfold­ in- the whole of our suffering, even though thou sightest over the evils:
who is there that hath not fallen ?
and whom of the leaders of the host shall we bewail, who, having been appointed to a sceptred office, by his death left his file deso­ late without their chief?
MES.
Xerxes himself lives, and beholds the light.
AT.
Thou tellest me of a great light to my house, and a bright-dawning day after a night wrapped in gloom.
MES.
But Artembares, leader of a myriad of horse, is dashed against the rugged shores of Sileniæ2.
And Dadaces the chiliarch, beneath the stroke of the spear, bounded a light leap out of his vessel.
Tenagon too, the true-born chieftain3 of the Bactrians, haunts the sea-beat isle of Ajax.
Lilæus, and Ar­ sames, and Argestes third, overcome, keep butting against the hard shore around the dove-breeding isle.
Arcteus, too, that dwelt near the sources of Egyptian Nile, Adeues, and Pheres­ seues the third, Pharnuchus, these fell from one vessel.
Matal­ lus of Chrysa, commander of a myriad, leader of a body of thirty thousand black cavalry, in his death, tinged his bright auburn.
bushy, thick, shadowy beard, changing its colour with a stain of purple4.
And Arabus the Mage, and Artames the Bactrian, a settler on the rugged land, perished there.
Amestris, and Amphistreus who wielded a spear that did great execution, and brave Ariomardus1 occasioning grief to Sardis, and Sesames, the Mysian;
'
Tharybis, too, commander of five times fifty ships, of Lyrnæan race, a hero of fair form, lies wretched, having died by no means happily.
And Syennesis, foremost in gallantry, governor of the Cilicians, that with his single arm occasioned much trouble to the foe, fell gloriously.
Of such of our leaders have I now made mention ;
and I re­ port a few of the many evils that have befallen us.
AT.
Alas !
Alas !
I hear these supreme of horrors, both a disgrace to the Persians, and a subject for shrill shriek­ ings.
But turn back again and tell me this, how great was the number of the ships of the Greeks, that they ventured to join battle with the Persian armament in the encounter of vessels ?
MESS.
So far as numbers are concerned, be well assured that the barbarians had the advantage with their ships:
for the whole number of those of the Greeks amounted to ten squadrons of thirty, and beside these there were ten of surpass­ ing excellence2.
But Xerxes, for I know this also, had a thou­ sand, the number of those which he led:
and those which exceeded in swiftness were two hundred and seven:
thus runs report.
Do we seem to you to have been inferior in fight in this respect3 ?
But 'twas some divinity that thus depressed the balance with a counterpoise of fortune.
AT.
The gods preserve the city of the goddess Pallas4.
MESS.
The city indeed of Athens is still not laid waste, for while there are men there is a sure bulwark.
AT.
And what was the commencement of the encoun­ ter of the ships?
Tell us;
who began the fight, was it the Greeks, or my son, elated by, the multitude of his ships ?
MESS.
It was some fiend, lady, or evil spirit appearing from some quarter or other that began all the mischief.
For a Greek that had come from the host of the Athenians1, told thy son Xerxes this, that, when the gloom of murky night should come, the Greeks would not remain, but, springing on the benches of their vessels, would severally, in different direc­ tions, save their lives by stealthy flight.
And he, as soon as he heard it, not aware of the stratagem of the Greek, nor ol the jealousy of the gods, publishes this order to all his cap­ tains, that when the sun should have ceased to illumine the earth with his rays, and darkness tenant the temple of the firmament, they should draw up the squadron of the ships in three lines, to guard the outlets, and the murmuring passes of the sea, and others in a circle around the isle of Ajax;
so that if the Greeks should elude fatal destruction, by discovering any escape for their ships by stealth, it was decreed, that they all should be deprived of their heads.
To this effect he spake from a frantic spirit;
for he knew not that which was preor.
dained of the gods.
And they, without disorder, and with obedient mind, both provided supper for themselves, and the mariner lashed his oar to the well-fitted rowlock.
And when the light of the sun had waned, and night had come on, every man, master of an oar, went on board his ship, and every one that had sway over arms ;
and one line of ships of war cheered on another line, and they make sail as each had been appointed, and all the live-long night the commanders of the ships were keeping the whole naval host occupied in sailing about.
And night withdrew, and the force of the Greeks by no means made a stealthy escape in any direction.
But when Day, drawn by white steeds, had occupied the whole earth, of radiance beautiful to behold, first of all a shout from the Greeks greeted Echo like a song, and Echo from the island­ rock at the same instant shouted forth an inspiring cry:
and terror fell on all the barbarians, baulked of their purpose;
for not as in flight were the Greeks then chaunting the solemn pæan, but speeding on to the fight with gallant daring of soul.
And the trumpet, with its clang, inflamed their whole line;
and forthwith, with the collision of the dashing oar, at the word of command they smote the roaring brine.
And quickly were they conspicuous to view.
The right wing, well marshalled, led on foremost in good order, and secondly, their whole force was coming forth against us.
and we could at the same time hear a mighty shout:
SONS OF THE GREEKS !
ON !
FREE YOUR COUNTRY, AND FREE YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR ,VIVES, THE ABODES TOO OF THE GODS OF YOUR FATHERS, AND THE TOMBS OF YOUR ANCESTORS;
NOW IS THE CONFLICT FOR THEM ALL !
And sooth to say, a murmur of the Persian tongue met them from our line, and no longer was it the moment to delay, but forthwith ship dashed her brazen prow at ship.
And a Grecian vessel commenced the en­ gagement, and breaks off the whole of the figure-head of a Phoenician ship:
and each commander severally directed his bark against another of the enemy's.
At first, indeed, the torrent of the Persian armament bore up against them :
but when the multitude of our ships were crowded in the strait, and no assistance could be given to one another, but they were struck by their own brazen beaks, and were smash­ ing their entire equipment of oars, and the Grecian vessels, not without science, were smiting them in a circle on all sides, and the hulls of our vessels were upturned, and the sea was no longer to behold, filled as it was with wrecks and the slaughter of men.
The shores, too, and the rugged rocks were filled with the dead ;
and every ship, as many as ever there were of the barbaric armament, was rowed in flight without order.
But the Greeks kept striking, hacking us as it were tunnies, or any draught of fishes, with fragments of oars, and splinters of wrecks;
and wailing filled the ocean brine with shrieks, until the eye of murky night removed it.
But for the multitude of our woes,-no, not if I should recite them in order for ten days, could I complete the tale for thee.
For be thou well assured of this, that there never fell in a single day a multitude of men of such number.
AT. Alas! alas!
a mighty ocean of ills has, in truth, burst upon both the Persians and the entire race of the bar­ barians.
MESS.
Be now well assured of this, that the evil hath not yet reached its half.
Such a visitation of ills hath come upon them, as to overbalance these even twice over.
AT.
And what event can have befallen that is yet more hateful than this ?
Say what misfortune this is, which, thou sayest, hath farther come upon the host, verging to greater horrors.
MESS.
As many of the Persians as were in the very bloom of life, most valiant in their spirit, and distinguished by their high birth, and were ever foremost in faithfulness to our monarch himself, have fallen foully by a most inglorious doom.
AT.
Alas!
the wretch that I am, my friends, by this evil hap.
And by what kind of doom sayest thou that these of whom thou speakest perished ?
MESS.
There is a certain island lying off the shores of Sala­ mis, small, a dangerous station for ships, which Pan, who delights in the dance, haunts on its beach.
Thither [Xerxes] sends these men, in order that, when the foeman wandering out of their ships should make their escape to the island, they might slay the soldiery of the Greeks, an easy prey, and res­ cue their comrades from the streams of the sea, ill knowing of the future ;
for when God gave the glory of the naval battle to the Greeks, on that very day having fortified their bodies in their armour well-wrought of brass, they leaped out of their vessels, and encompassed the whole island around, so that they were at a loss whither they should betake them­ selves;
for often were they smitten by stones from their hands, and arrows falling on them from the bowstring do­ stroyed them.
And at last, having charged them with one onslaught, they smite, they how in pieces the limbs of the wretches, until they had utterly destroyed the life of all of them.
And Xerxes shrieked aloud, when he saw the depth of his calamities;
for he had a seat that afforded a clear prospect1 of the whole armament, a high hill near the ocean brine;
and having rent his clothes, and uttered a shrill wail, after issuing orders quickly to the land forces, he dismisses them in disorderly flight.
Such a misfortune is it thine to wail over, in addition to the aforementioned.
AT. 0 hateful demon!
How hast thou then deluded the Persians in their hopes.
But bitter did my son find the vengeance of renowned Athens, and those of the barbarians, whom Marathon formerly destroyed, sufficed not, for whom my son, thinking to exact atonement, drew1 upon himself so great a multitude of sufferings.
But say thou-those of the ships which esaped destruction—where didst thou leave them ?
knowest thou so as to tell clearly ?
MESS.
The commanders of the ships, indeed, which were left, tumultuously take to flight before the wind, not in gooc.
order.
But the residue of the forces perished both in the land of the Bœotians—some around the fountain spring suffer­ ing from thirst, and some2 of us exhausted by panting, pass on thence into the territory of the Phocians, and the land of Doris, and the Melian bay, where Spercheius waters the plain with kindly stream;
and thence the soil of the Achaian land, and the city of the Thessalians received us, straitened for want of food:
here, indeed, a great many perished both from thirst and hunger;
for both these evils befel us.
We came also into the land of Magnesia, and the country of the Macedonians, to the ford of the Axius, and the fenny reed of Bolbe, and to mount Pangæus, Edonian land.
And in this night God called up winter out of his season3, and congeals the whole stream of the sacred Strymon.
And one that had aforetime believed not in the gods, then made prayer in orisons, doing reverence to earth and heaven4.
And after that the host had ceased from offering their many invocations, it makes its passage across the ice-bound stream.
And whosoever of us had sped our way before the rays of the god had been shed abroad, bath escaped;
for the bright orb of the sun blazing with his beams, penetrated through the middle of the stream, warming it with its blaze.
They fell, too, one upon another;
and happy, in sooth, was any that most speedily broke off the breath of life.
And as many as survived and attained to safety, having with difficulty made their way through Thrace with much toil1, having made their escape, have reached, in no great numbers, the land of their homes;
so that the city of the Persians may well sigh, regretting the dearest youth of our country.
These tidings are true :
but I omit to tell you of many of the horrors which the god bath hurled down upon the Persians.
On.
0 dæmon, hard to struggle with, how exceedingly heavy hast thou with thy feet leaped on the entire Persian race !
AT.
Alas!
wretched that I am for our undone host!
0 manifest phantom of my visions of the night, how too truly didst thou discover the horrors to me.
And very sorrily did ye interpret these things.
But notwithstanding, since your speech sanctions this, I would fain first of all make my prayers to the gods ;
then will I come, after fetching from ym dwelling2 a sacrificial cake, offerings both for earth and for the departed:
over things past [recal] I well know, but it may be that something more auspicious will befal hereafter.
But it behoves you to communicate faithful counsels with the faithful, touching what has taken place;
and for my son, if he come hither before me, soothe ye him, and escort him into his dwelling, lest even a further ill be added over and above to our present ills3.
[Exit ATOSSA.CH. 0 sovereign Jove!
now hast thou destroyed the arma­ ment of the high-vaunting and numerous Persians ;
and thou hast veiled in gloomy grief the city of Susa and of Ecbatana :
and many virgins, rending their veils with their delicate hands, sharing in the sorrow, drench their bosoms with dense floods of tears.
Our Persian matrons too, in excess of mourning, longing for the sight of the recent wedlock of their husbands, and having abandoned their couches' covered with elegant tapestry, the delight of their delicate youth, they sorrow with most insatiate sighs.
And I, for my part, heartily take [for my theme] the melancholy fate of the departed.
Now, in truth, the whole of the land of Asia made ceso.
late moans.
For Xerxes led forth, 0 gods!
and Xerxes lost, well-a-day!
Xerxes managed all things haplessly in his ocean-barks.
Oh !
why was not Darius at that time in com­ mand, so safe a master of the bow to the citizens, beloved sovereign of Susa?
The ships, all winged alike and with dark-stained beaks, carried forth both our land forces and our marines, 0 gods !
and ships destroyed them, ah !
well-a-day !
the ships with the deadly onslaughts of their beaks, and through the hands of the Ionians, as we hear, the king barely made his escape to the champagne and chilly tracts of Thrace.
They therefore, indeed, first met their doom, alas!
left by necessity, ah!
around the shores of Cychreial, woe's me!
they have been drenched by the billows2.
Moan, and gnash the teeth, and raise aloud the cry of sorrow;
laments that shall reach the heavens, woe's me !
and lengthen out the dismally-sounding shout, the piteous cry.
And torn dreadfully by the sea, alas!
they are lacerated by the dumb children, alas!
of the unpolluted [deep,] woe's me!
And the dwelling mourns its lord, bereft of him, and parents that are left childless, woe's me!
advanced in age, wailing the calamities sent on them by the divinities, now hear the whole of their sorrow.
And they in sooth through­ out the land of Asia, no longer own the Persian sway, nor any longer pay their tribute under constraint imposed by their sovereign, nor prostrating themselves on the ground will they hold themselves in subjection:
for the might of our monarch hath utterly perished.
And no longer is the tongue of mortals held in check:
for the people have been set at liberty to speak their mind freely, since the yoke of strength hath been loosened.
And the sea-washed isle of Ajax, with its soil stained with gore, holds the [bodies] of the Persians.
My friends, whosoever is experienced in evils knows that when a sea-surge of troubles comes upon mortals, they are wont to dread all things:
but when fortune glides smoothly, to feel confident that the same divinity will constantly propel their fortunes with a favourable breeze.
For to me now all things are full of terror, and before my eyes appear the adverse dis- pensations of the gods;
and there is ringing in my ears a strain not soothing;
such an amazement in consequence of these horrors scares my soul.
Wherefore I have come this way from my house a second time, without either car or my former pomp, bringing propitiatory drink-offerings for the sire of my child, things which are soothing charms to the dead;
both, white milk, sweet for drink, from a holy cow, and the distillation of the flower-craftsman, transparent honey, along with limpid drops of a virgin fountain1, and this pure liquid from its wild mother, the glory of an ancient vine;
and the fragrant fruit of the pale-green olive, that ever flourishes as to life in its leaves, is at hand, and wreathed flowers, children of the all-teeming earth.
But, my friends, chaunt ye lays in accordance with these libations of the dead, and call up the divine Darius, and I will convey to the gods below these honours that are to be drank by earth.
,CH. Royal dame, venerable majesty of the Persians, do thou convey libations to the chambers beneath the earth, and we, in our lays, will implore the conductors of the dead beneath the earth to be propitious.
Come, 0 ye holy divinities below the earth, both Earth and Mercury, and thou.
monarch of the dead, send from beneath the spirit into the light of day;
for if he knows any remedy2 of our ills, he alone could tell the ter­ mination more than mortals3.
Does then the godlike monarch, of blessed memory, hear me as I utter the all -varied barbaric clear plaintive dismal cries?
A loud outcry will I make over our utterly wretched sorrows.
Does he then hear me from beneath the earth?
But do thou, 0 Earth, and ye other rulers of the infernal regions, suffer the illustrious divinity, the god of the Persians, born in Susa, to pass from your dwellings, and send him into upper air, such an one as never heretofore Persian mould covered.
Aye, dear was the man, and dear is his sepulchre, for dear was the character that it entombs.
And thou, Aldoneus, that dost send the shades to this upper world, set at liberty, Aidoneus, Darius, all kingly as he was.
Alas1!
For as at no time he was the destroyer of men by the wast­ in,, calamities of war, so he was called by his Persians, counsellor divine;
and counsellor divine he was, for he conducted the host well.
Lord2, ancient lord, come, draw nigh, appear on the topmost peaks of the mound, raising the saffrou dyed sandal of thy foot, displaying the crest of thy royal tiara.
Come forth, 0 Darius, author of no ill:
Hoa4!
Show thyself, sovereign lord5, that thou mayest hear the sorrows of our sovereign, strange in their nature, and new.
For some Sty­ gian gloom is hovering over us;
for all6 our youth have already sunk in ruin.
Come forth, 0 Darius, author of no ill:
Hoa !
alas!
alas !
0 thou that didst die deeply deplored by thy friends!
70 king, 0 king!
why should these redoubled mishaps pass throughout all this thy land?
All the three­ banked galleys of this our land have utterly perished, so as to be no longer galleys.
O ye most trusty of the trusty!
ye compeers of my youth, aged Persians, with what trouble is our city troubled?
the ground groans, is smitten and torn8.
And beholding my consort here near my sepulchre, I am in fear, I have received soothing libations.
And ye arc wailing, standing near my sepulchre, and shouting shrill in cries that evoke the shades, ye piteously summon me.
And exit is no easy matter, both in all other respects, and also inasmuch as the gods beneath the ground are better at receiving than at letting go.
Notwithstanding, I having rule among them, am come ;
and be thou quick, that I may not be censured for the time [of my absence].
What new heavy calamity bath befallen the Persians ?CH.
I shrink in awe from looking on thee, and I shrink in awe from speaking in thy presence, by reason of my ancient reverence for thee.
DAR.
But since persuaded by thy groanings I have come from below, in no wise utter a tedious tale, but concisely tell me, and complete the whole, laying aside thine awe for me.
CH.
I dread1 to comply, and I dread to speak in thy pre­ sence, telling things hateful to tell to friends.
DAR.
But since the ancient dread of thy spirit is an obsta­ cle to thee, do thou, aged partner of my bed, high-born dame, cease from these wailings and groans of thine, and give me a clear account.
Human calamities will befal mankind.
For many ills arise to mortals by sea, and many by land, if their more lengthened life be far protracted.
AT.
0 thou who in thy prosperous lot didst excel all mortals, inasmuch as thou, so long as thou didst behold the rays of the sun, an object of envy, didst lead a continued life of happiness as a god to the Persians;
now too do I envy thee dead, before thou didst witness this depth of ills.
For in brief words thou shalt hear, Darius, the whole tale.
In a word, the fortunes of the Persians have been utterly o'er­ thrown.
DAR.
In what way?
came there any blast of pestilence, or a rebellion on the city ?
AT.
By no means;
but the whole host hath been utterly destroyed about Athens.
DAR.
And which of my sons led an armament thither?
tell me.
AT.
Impetuous Xerxes, after draining the whole surface of the continent.
DAR.
Was it by land or by sea that he, wretched, made this mad attempt ?
AT.
Both.
There was a twofold face of two armaments.
DAR.
And how too did such large land forces accomplish their passage ?
AT.
With machines he bridged the frith of Helle, so as to have a passage.
DAR.
And did he effect this, so as to shut up the mighty Bosporus ?
AT.
Such is the fact:
but some dæmon, I ween, abetted his inclination.
DAR.
Alas!
some mighty daemon came, so that he had not his right senses.
AT.
Yes—so that we can see how evil an issue he accom­ plished.
DAR.
And how fared they over whom ye are thus pouring your lament ?
AT.
The naval force being worsted was the destruction of the land armament.
DAR.
And hath the whole host thus utterly been destroyed by the spear?
AT.
Aye, so that, moreover, the whole city of Susa mourns its desolation1.
DAR.
0 ye gods!
good2 was the support and assistance of the army!
AT.
And the whole Bactrian population hath perished in utter ruin, and that no aged people3 ?DAR.
0 wretched man!
how much of the youth of our allies then hath he destroyed.
AT.
They say too that Xerxes alone and destitute, with not manyDAR.
endedhow and where ?
is there any escape ?
AT. arrivedgladly at the bridge that links the two continents4.DAR.
andreached in this continent ?
is this true ?
AT.
Yes:
a clear account prevails;
in this, at all events, there is no dispute.
DAR.
Alas!
swift indeed came the accomplishment of the oracles ;
and upon my son Jove hath inflicted the consumma­ tion of the divine declarations.
I have expected that the gods would bring these things to their complete fulfilment after a long issue1.
But when a man is himself speeding onward, god also lends a hand.
Now a fountain of ills seems to have been discovered for my friends.
And my son, not understanding this, bath brought it about by his youthful pre­ sumption;
who hoped to check in its course the sacred Hellespont, the Bosporus, stream of the god, like a slave, with bonds, and was for reducing the stream to order;
and binding it with hammer-wrought fetters, accomplished a great road for his great army, and he un wisely thought, mortal as he was, that he should get the mastery of all the gods, and of Neptune.
Did not therefore a distemper of soul possess ray son ?
I fear lest my great store of wealth shall become a prey to the first comer.
AT.
These things is impetuous Xerxes taught by con­ sorting with evil men ;
and they tell him, how that thou didst win great wealth for thy children with thy spear, but that he, from want of manhood, wars at home, and nought augments his patrimonial opulence.
Hearing such taunts as these oftentimes from evil men, he planned this expedition and armament against Greece.
DAR.
Therefore a work has been accomplished by him2 exceedingly great, ever to be had in remembrance, such as never at any time utterly drained this falling city of Susa, ever since sovereign Jove awarded this honour, that one man should sway the whole of flock-breeding Asia, wielding the sceptre of rule.
For a Mede3 was the first commander of the host;
and another4, his son, completed this work;
for pru­ dence managed the helm of his soul.
And third from him Cyrus, a prosperous man, when he reigned gave peace to all his friends;
and acquired the people of the Lydians and Phrygians.
and subdued by his prowess the whole of Ionia For god did not abhor him, because he was discreet.
And fourth1 in order a son of Cyrus ruled the host:
and Smerdis reigned fifth, a disgrace to his country, and to the ancient throne:
but valiant Artaphrenes, along with friends, whose part this was2, slew him in the palace by stratagem.
And I too attained to the lot which I desired, and waged many wars with a large army;
but I brought not such great mischief as this upon the city.
But Xerxes my son, bLin,,- young, has youthful thoughts, and bears not in mind ray injunctions;
for of this be ye well and distinctly assured, ye my compeers in age, all of us who held this sovereignty, could not be shown to have wrought so many evils.
CH.
What then, my liege Darius ?
to what point turnest thou the issue of thy words ?
In consequence of these events, how shall we thy Persian host hereafter fare as best may be ?DAR.
If we make not war upon the country of the Greeks;
no, not even if the Median force be the larger:
for to them the earth herself is an ally.
On:
.
How sayest thou this ?and in what way acts it as an ally ?
bAR.
Inasmuch as it slays by famine those that are over numerous.
On.
Well, but we will furnish forth an expedition well equipped and select.
DAR.
Aye, but not even shall the army that now remains in the regions of Hellas attain to a safe return.
CH.
How sayest thou :
What!
does not the whole arma­ ment of the barbarians cross the frith of Helle from Europe ?
DAR.
Few, be sure, of many, if it be proper for one that looks upon what hath now taken place at all to put faith in the declarations of the gods:
for it is not that one part is ac­ complished, and another not.
And if this be the fact, the multitude selected out of the army fails, having been lured on by groundless expectations.
lAnd they are remaining where Asopus with his streams waters the plain, a kind enrich­ ment of the Boeotian fields:
where the supreme of horrors await them to suffer, in retribution for their presumption and godless devices;
who, when they arrived in the land of Hellas, shrunk not from despoiling the statues of the gods, nor from firing their shrines :
but the altars are demolished, and the temples of the divinities utterly overthrown from their basements in confused ruin ;
wherefore, having done evil, they experience not less, and will still further;
and not yet is it come to the dregs' of their calamities, but still they keep on gushing forth:
for so great a clotted gore-drip­ ping mass shall there be amid the land of the Platæans, beneath the Dorian spear;
and heaps of corpses, even to the third generation, shall voicelessly announce to the eyes of mortale, how that it becomes not one that is mortal to enter­ tain thoughts too high for him.
For presumption, when it has bloomed, is wont to produce for fruit a crop of Atè, whence it reaps an all-mournful harvest.
Seeing such are the recompenses of these things, be ye mindful of Athens and of Hellas, and let not any one contemning his present fortune, enamoured of other things, cast away great felicity.
Jove is in sooth over us a chastiser of extremely overbearing thoughts, a stern censor.
Wherefore do ye instruct him, destitute as he is of prudence3, with reasonable admonitions, that he should cease to insult the gods with his overweening confi­ dence.
And do thou, dear aged mother of Xerxes, go into the palace, and feteh vesture such as is seemly, and meet thy child;
for in his sorrow for these misfortunes, tatters of his embroidered robes are rent all about his person.
But do thou mildly soothe him with words;
for to thee alone, I am assured, will he endure to listen.
But I will depart from earth into the gloom that is beneath.
And you, my aged friends, give yourselves to joy, though ye be in afflictions, giving your spirits to pleasure day by day ;
since to the dead wealth is of no avail.
[The shade of DARIUS descends4.
CH.
Verily I feel sorrow when I hear of the many woes that both even now press upon, and are hereafter to befal, the barbarians.
AT. 0 Fortune!
how many bitter sorrows are coming upon me, and most of all doth this mischance prey upon my spirit, when I hear also of the dishonour of the robes about the person of my child1, which envelope him.
But I will go, and having fetched vesture from the house, I will endeavour to meet my son.
For we will not desert in their misfortunes those that are dearest to us.
[ ATOSSA enters the palace.
CHORUS.
0 ye gods!
we surely enjoyed a noble and goodly life, under civic rule, when the aged monarch, aider of all, author of no ill, not given to war, godlike Darius ruled the realm.
In the first place we were celebrated on account of our well-approved army, and the laws of the state directed all things 2.
And our returns too from our wars brought us without trouble, without suffering, in flourishing condition to our homes.
And what a number of cities did he take without having crossed the river Halys, nor having sped forth from his home;
such are the Acheloian cities on the Strymonian sea, adjoining the dwellings of the Thraeians, and beyond the sea, those along the main land environed with fortresses obeyed this king, and those who boast3 to dwell on both sides of the broad frith of Helle, and the gulfy Propontis, and the outlet of the Poutus :
the sea-girt islands too, near the marine promontory, lying hard by this land, Lesbos, for instance, and olive-planted Samos, Chios, and Pares, Myconus, and Andros touching in close neighbourhood upon Tenos.
He was lord too of the sea-girt isles situate midway between the con­ tinents, Lemnos, and the dwelling of Icarus, and Rhodes, Cnidus too, and the cities of Venus, Paphos, and Soli, and Salamis, the mother city of which is now the cause of our present sighs.
He ruled too, by his prudence, over the opulent populous cities of the Greeks in the Ionian district.
And there was at hand an unconquerable power of armed men, and of allies gathered from every nation.
But now we, in no dubious way, have to endure the overthrow of these things from the hand of the gods, being terribly beaten down by wars, and by disasters on the deep.
Alas !
wretched that I am, having met with this hateful doom beyond all conjecture ;
-how ruthlessly hath the deemon assailed the race of the Persians!
What shall I suffer miserable ?
for the vigour of my limbs fails as I look upon this [aged] company of citizens here before me.
0 Jove!
that the doom of death could enshroud me also along with the men that are departed.
CH. Well-a-day, my liege !
for the goodly armament, and the great honour accruing to the Persians from their vassal states, and the fair array of men, whom now the deemon bath mowed down.
And the land bewails her native youth that have been brought to death by Xerxes;
who crams Hades with Persians.
For to Hades are gone2 many, for countless was the mass3, the flower of the realm vanquished with the bow, of men that have utterly perished.

Pour ye forth a grievous all-lamentable, sad-re­ sounding voice ;
for this dæmon hath made a turn back upon me.

and again will I utter the extremely tearful moan.

CH.
And, in truth, we regret another too, Xanthus, leader of ten thousand Mardians, and warlike Anehares, Diæxis too, and Arsames, chiefs of the cavalry, Cigdates and Lythimnes, and Tolmus that was never satisfied with the spear.

A WATCHMAN.
CHORUS OF OLD MEN OF ARGOS.
WATCHMAN.
I pray the gods a deliverance from these toils, a remedy' for my year-long watch, in which, couching on my elbows2 on the roofs of the Atreidæ, like a do--,, I have contemplated the host3 of the nightly stars, and the bright.
potentates that bear winter and summer to mortals, con­ spicuous in the firmament.
And now I am watching for the si>gnal of the beacon, the blaze of fire that brings a voice from Troy, and tidings of its capture;
for thus strong in hope is the woman's heart, of manly counsel4.
And whilst I have a night bewildered and dew-drenched couch1, not visited by dreams, for fear, in place of sleep, stands at my side, so that I cannot firmly close my eyelids in slumber.
And when I think to sing or whistle, preparing2 this the counter- charm of song against sleep, then do I mourn, sighing over the sad condition of this house, that is not, as of yore, most excellently administered.
But now, may there be a happy release from my toils, as the fire of joyous tidings appears through the gloom!
Oh hail!
thou lamp of night, thou that displayest a light like as the day, and the marshalling of many dances in Argos, on account of this event3.
Ho !
ho !
I will give a signal distinetly to the wife of Agamemnon, that she, having arisen with all speed from her couch, may raise aloud a joyous shout in welcome to this beacon, if indeed the city of Ilion is taken, as the beacon-light stands forth4 announc­ ing;
and I myself will dance a prelude.
For I will eount the throws of my lord that have fallen well, mine own5, since this kindling of the beacon-light has cast me thrice six.
May it then befal me to grasp with this hand of mine the friendly hand of the sovereign of this palace on his arrival.
But for the rest I am silent;
a mighty ox hath come upon my tongue7:
but the house itself, could it find a voice, would tell most plainly.
Thus I readily speak to them that know, and for such as know not I have no memory.
[ Exit WATCHMAN.

This is now the tenth year since the great adver­ sary of Priam, king Menelaus and Agamemnon the stalwart yokel the Atreidæ, by the gift of Jove [possessed] of a twin- throned and twin-seeptered majesty, led from this land their armament of a thousand ships of the Argives, a warrior aid, screaming through passion a great noise of war, like vultures, which, in their sorrows for their young far from the [paths of men2,] wheel their flight high above their nests, oaring with the oars of their pinions, having lost the nestling care3 of their callow young :
but some god4, either Apollo, or Pan, or Jove, hearing aloft the shrill-voiced wail uttered by the birds on account of these outeasts5, sends Erinnys, the late avenger, upon the transgressors ;
—even so mighty Jove the Hospitable sends the sons of Atreus against Paris, about to impose on Greeks and Trojans alike, on account of the wife of many husbands, many limb-wearying struggles, when the knee is strained in the dust, and the spear-staff is shivered in the onset.
But things are as they are;
and will be brought to the issue doomed.
Neither by weeping nor by pouring libations, nor by shedding tears, will he soothe away the intense wrath of fireless rites1.
But we, with our unhonoured aged frame, remain left behind the armament of that time, propping on staves OUT childlike strength.
For both the mar­ row of youth shooting up within our breasts is weak as age, and Mars is not in place;
and very advanced age like­ wise, after that its foliage is already withered, totters along its three-footed path, and nought superior to a child, flits like a day-dream.
But thou, daughter of Tyndarus, Queen Cly­ tæmnestra, what means this ?
what new event ?
what is it that thou hast heard, and on the faith of what tidings art thou burning incense sent around2 ?
and the altars of all our city­ guarding gods, of those above and those below, gods of hea­ ven and gods of the forum, are blazing with offerings :
and in different directions different flames are streaming upward, high as heaven, drugged with the mild unadulterated cordials of pure unguent, with the royal cake, brought from the inmost cells3.
Concerning these things tell one both what is possible and lawful for thee to say4, and become thou the healer of this distracting anxiety, which now one while is full of evil thought, but at another time, because of the sacrifices, hope hiandly fawning1 upon me repels the insatiate care, the rank­ ling sorrow that is preying upon my heart.
I am2 able to tell of the prowess of the surpassing3 heroes, well-omened on the way—for still from the gods doth persua­ sion inspire me with song, [and] the commensurate crisis with strength4—how the impetuous bird sends against the land of Teueer the twin-throned power of the Arehæans, the one­ minded chief of the youth of Hellas, with spear and avenging hand, the monarch of birds to the monarehs of the ships, one of them black and the other white behind, having appeared near the palace, on the right hand in all-conspicuous position6, feeding on a hare-brood teeming with embryo-offspring, cut off from their last6 course.
Chaunt Ælinon, Ælinon !
but may the good prevail.
And the clever seer of the army, having seen the twin-warlike Atreidæ differing7 in their spirits, knew [them for] the devourers of the hare, and the com­ manders who led the expedition, and thus he spake expound­ ing the portent:
" In time of a truth shall this inroad take the city of Priam;
but of all the public wealth in its towers shall Destiny first violently make havoe8.
Only may no envy from the gods fling gloom over the mighty embattled curb forged against Troy:
for chaste Diana is jealous against the house, on account of the winged hounds1 of the sire, that made a victim of the wretehed hare together with her brood before delivery, and she loathes the banquet of the eagles.
Chaunt Ælinon, Ælinon!
but may the good prevail.
So kindly is the fair2 goddess to the eubs of fierce lions unable to follow3 [their dams], and to the suckling whelps of all the wild beasts that roam the field, and she beseeches [her father ]4 to bring to a favourable issue these omens;
propitious indeed, yet open to complaint are the apparitions5.
And I invoke Ieïan Pæan, that she may not work any long ship-detaining stress of wea­ ther, with winds adverse to the Greeks, urging on another sacrifice, an impious one, banquetless, the framer of strife among kindred, having no awe for a husband:
for there abides a fearful, recurring6, fraudful keeper of the house, a mindful child-avenging wrath."
—Such destinies, drawn from birds seen upon the march, did Calehas along with great blessings ehant forth to the royal households.
And in harmony with these ehaunt Ælinon, Ælinon !
but may the good prevail.
Love—whosoever7 he be, if this name be well-pleasing to him when invoked, by this do I address him;
balancing all reasons.
I am not able to make any further guess, except Jove, if in truth it behoves me to cast off the groundless burthen of anxiety.
Nor can he who before was great, flourishing in unconquerable boldness say aught, as one that has passed away1;
and he who existed next has passed away, having found his third thrower2.
But any one that cheerfully cele­ brates
Jove in songs of triumph shall completely attain tc understanding ;
him that leads mortals the way to wisdom, that places knowledge upon suffering, firmly to remain3.
/
But e'en in slumber the pang of the memory of ills keeps dripping before the heart, and Wisdom hath come to the wayward.
But 'tis a gift, I ween, of the divinities who sit severely4
Oil the awful bench.
Then too the senior leader of the ships of the Greeks, blaming no seer, but breathing with the fortunes that befell himwhen the Grecian host was afflicted by stress of weather5, while it was occupying the coast beyond Chalets, in the refluent coasts of Aulis, and blasts that came from the Strymon.
of evil holiday, of direful famine, and ill anchorage, stray guides to mortals, unsparing both of ships and cables, rendering the time [of voyage] twice the length —werecarding down with delayS the flower of the Greeks;
when moreover the seer loudly announced to the chieftains another more grievous remedy for the fell tempest7, bring­ ing forward Diana;
so that the Atreidæ, smiting the ground with their sceptres, checked not the tear, and the elder monarch spake thus aloud:
“ Hard is the fate not to obey;
hard too if I am to sacrifice my daughter, the ornament of my house, polluting a father's hands with the gushings of a virgin's blood near the altar.
Which of these alternatives is without its horrors ?
How can I be a deserter of the fleet, failing the confederacy?
for it is meet that they.
with wrath full wrathfully should desire the sacrifice that shall lull the winds, and the blood of the maiden,-for it would be well."
But after that he had put on the yoke of necessity, breathing an impious, impure, unholy change of soul, from that time he changed his mind so as to cherish all-daring thoughts.
For wretched frenzy, first source of woe, of foul counsel, hardens mortals.
And thus he dared to become the sacrificer of his 'daughter, to promote a war undertaken for the avenging of a woman, and as a first offering2 for the fleet:
and the chieftains, eager for the fight, set at nought her supplications, and her cries to her father3, and her maiden age.
But after prayer her father bade the ministering priests with all zeal, to lift like a kid high above the altar, her who lay prostrate wrapt in her robes, and to put a check upon her beauteous mouth, a voice of curses4 upon the house, by force of muzzles and strength which allowed no vent to her cry.
And pouring to the ground her vestments of saffron dye, she smote each of her sacrificers with a piteous glance from her eye, and remarkable in her beauty.
as in a picture, wishing to speak;
since oft times in the hospitable halls of her father she was wont to sing, and undeflowered in maidenhood, to do honour with fond respect by her voice to the life of her father happy to a third libation1.
What followed thereupon neither did I witness, nor do I tell;
but the divinations of Calchas fail not of accomplishment.
To those that suffer, indeed Justice brings knowledge.
But for futurity2, since it will come farewell to it—’tis but the same with sorrowing beforehand;
for the event will come dawning elearly with the morning rays3.
Oh!
may there be in the sequel a happy issue, as wishes this the sole guardian, closest bulwark of the Apian land4.
I have come revering thy majesty, Cly­ tæmnestra ;
for right it is to honour the consort of a chieftain hero, when the monarch's throne has been left empty.
And gladly shall I hear whether thou, having learned aught that is good or not, art doing sacrifice with hopes that herald glad­ ness-yet not if thou continuest silent will there be offence.
Let morning become, as the adage runs, a herald of gladess from its mother night.
And learn thou a joy greater than thy hope to hear ;
for the Argives have taken the city of Priam.
On.
How sayest thou?
thy word escaped me from in­ credulity.
CLYT.
I say that Troy is in the power of the Argives— speak I clearly ?CH.
Joy is stealing over me, that calls forth a tear.
CLYT.
Ay, for thy countenance proves thy loyalty.
CH.
Why, what sure proof hast thou of these things ?
CLYT.
I have a proof-why not?-unless the deity hath deluded me.
CH.
Art thou, then, reverencing the vision of dreams, that win easy credence ?
CLYT.
I would not take the opinion of my soul when sunk in slumber.
CH.
But did some wingless rumour gladden thy mind ?
CLYT.
Thou sharply mockest my sense as that of a young girl.
CH.
And at what time hath the city been sacked ?
CLYT.
I say in the night that hath now brought forth this day.
On.
And what messenger could come with such speed ?
CLYT.
Vulcan, sending forth a brilliant gleam from Ida;
and beacon dispatched beacon of courier-fire1 hitherward.
Ida, first, to the Hermæan promontory of Lemnos, and third in order Athos, mount of Jove, received the great torch from the isle, and passing o'er so as to ridge the sea, the might of the lamp as it joyously2 travelled, the pine-torch transmitting its gold-gleaming splendour, like a sun, to the watch-towers of Macistus.
And [the watchman] omitted not his share of the messengers duty, either by any delay, or by being carelessly overcome by sleep :
but the light of the beacon coining from afar to the streams of the Euripus gives signal to the watchmen of Messapius ;
and they lighted a flame in turn, and sent the tidings onwards, having kindled with fire a pile of withered heath.
And the lamp, in its strength not yet at all bedimmed, bounding over the plain of the Asopus, like the bright moon to the crag of Cithæron, aroused another relay of the courier fire.
And the watch refused not the light that was sent from afar, lighting a larger pile than those above- mentioned ;
but it darted across the lake Gorgopis, and having reached mount Ægiplanctus, stirred it up, that the rule3 of fire might not be stint.
And lighting it up in unscanting strength, they send on a mighty beard of flame, so that it passed glaring beyond the headland that looks down upon the Saronic frith, then it darted down until it reached the Arachuæan height.
the neighbouring post of observation, and thereupon to this roof of the Atreidæ here darts this light, no new descendant' of the fire of Ida.
Such, in truth, were my regulations for the bearers of the torch fulfilled by succession from one to another;
and the first and the last in the course:
surpass [the rest].
Such proof and signal do I tell thee of my husband having sent me tidings from Troy.
CH.
To the gods, my queen!
I will make prayer hereafter;
but I could wish to hear and to admire once more, at length, these tidings as thou tellest them.
CLYT.
On this very day the Greeks are in possession of Troy:
I think that a discordant clamour is loud in the city.
If you pour into the same vessel both vinegar and oil, you will pronounce that they are foemen, and not friends.
So you may hear the voices of the captured and the conquerors distinct [because of] a double result;
for the one party having fallen about the corpses of men, both those of brothers, and children those of their aged parents, are bewailing, from a throat that is no longer free, the death of those that were dearest to them.
But the other party, on the contrary is hungry, fatigue from roaming all the night after the battle arranging at meals of such things as the city furnishes, by no fixed law in the dis­ tribution, but as each bath drawn the lot of fortune3.
Already are they dwelling in the captured houses of the Trojans, freed from the frost beneath the sky, and from the dews, thus will they, poor wretches4, sleep the whole night through without sentries.
And if they reverence well the tutelary gods of the land which they have conquered, and the fines of the god, assuredly, after having been captors, they shall not in their turn become captives.
But let no lust first fall upon the army of making havoc of things forbidden, overcome by lucre.
For, in order to a safe return, they must turn back through the other length of the race.
But if the host return in guilt6, the curse of those slain might awake in the [minds of the] sods, even though fresh misehances should not befall them.
Such words thou mayest hear from me a woman.
But may the good prevail, so that we may see it in no wavering balance;
for I have received in this an enjoyment of many blessings.
Cii.
My queen, thou speakest sensibly like a prudent man:
and I, having heard thy sure tokens, prepare myself to make fitting addresses to the gods;
since no inglorious reward of our toils bath been achieved.
[Exit CLYTÆMNESTRA.0 sovereign Jove, and friendly night, possessor of mighty glories, and that didst fling a close net over the towers of Troy, so that neither old nor young could overleap the vast toil of slavery, all-ensnaring bane1.
I therefore revere the mighty Xenian Jove. that hath accomplished these things, that bent his bow aforetime against Paris, in such wise that the shaft might not idly descend either before the proper moment, or above the stars2.
They have to say that they feel the stroke of Jove.
This we may trace out exactly.
He hath fared according as he hath wrought*.
Some one denied that the gods deigned to have the care of mortals, by whom the honour of hallowed things might be trampled on4.
Not holy was he;
and it is upon the descendants of those who were breathing forth, more violently than just, a war which they ought not to have dared, while their dwellings were teeming beyond all measure, beyond what is best1.
But may an untroubled lot be mine, so as for a man well disposed in disposition to have sufficient strength2.
For there is no bulwark in wealth against destruc­ tion to the man who, in the wantonness of his heart, has spurned the great altar of Justice:
but wretched Persuasion, intolerable daughter of Atè, joint in her councils3, forces him on;
and remedy is utterly vain.
Guilt is not concealed, but is conspicuous, a light of lurid glare;
and like adulterate brass is proved black-in-grained by wear, and by attrition, when a boy pursues a bird upon the wing, bringing upon his country a blow beyond all endurance.
And not one of the gods lends an ear to his orisons, but sweeps away the unrighteous that hath concerned himself with these doings.
Such too was Paris, when he came to the mansion of the Atreidæ, and profaned the hospitable board by the abduction of a wife.
And she, leaving citizens shield-bearers, and the discomfiture of spears, and naval armaments, and bearing to Ilion destruction as her dowry, passed swiftly through the gates, having dared undareable deeds:
and much did the bards.
of the house lament as they told this ditty,-" Alas!
alas!
for the palace and the chiefs;
alas!
for the couch, and the footsteps of her who once loved her spouse5, He stands by silent, dishonoured, uttering no reproach, not believing that he sees her eloped.
And in yearning after her beyond the sea, a phantom will seem to rule the house, and the beauty of fair-formed statues is loathed by her husband, and in the unfed glance1 of his eyes all their loveliness passes away.
And melancholy visions, appearing in dreams, present themselves, bringing a vain delight;
for vain it is when any one seeming to see blessings, the vision having slipped tnrough his hands, passes away forthwith on the pinions that lackey on the paths of sleep."
These, indeed are the sorrows at the hearth', within the mansion, but there are sorrows surpassing these.
And universally because of the heroes who went together from the land of Hellas, the sorrow of a patient spirit from the families of each is plainly observable.
Many things of a truth touch them to the core;
for those whom any one sent forth, he knows, but, instead of men, urns and ashes come back to the dwellings of each.
And Mars, that barters for gold their bodies, and that holds the balance in the tug of the spears, sends to their friends some fragment of scorched dust from Ilion, a thing of bitter tears, filling the vases with light3 ashes instead of the man.
And they sigh as they praise one as skilled in fight and another as having fallen gloriously amid the carnage, in behalf of another's wife.
These things does many a one in silence mutter.
And jealous vexation creeps upon the chieftain Atridæ1.
And others, fair of form, there around the walls, occupy tombs in the land of Ilion;
and a foe-land shrouds them as its dwellers.
Bitter is the rumour of the citizens accompanied by wrath, and it pays the debt as of a curse2 ratified by the people.
And my anxious care is waiting to hear something wrapt in nightly gloom.
For the gods are not regardless of those that occasion great slaughter:
and the black Erinnyes in time, reduce to obscurity the man that is fortunate without righteousness, by a reverse of fortune;
and the power of him that lives among the obscure is naught.
Now for a man to have an exceedingly3 high reputation is a sad thing;
for the thunderbolt from Jove is lanched against his eyes4;
but I prefer happiness free from envy.
May I never be a saeker of cities, nor yet myself a captive may I see my life under the control of others.
But by the fire that brings glad tidings a swift rumour is pervading the city-but who knows whether it be true5?
or some delusion of the gods.
Who is so childish, or bereft of judgment, as, after having been warmed in heart by the recent tidings of the beacon-light, to despond at a change of news?
It fits a woman's it7 to acknowledge a boon before it has appeared.
The female sex, over credulous, ranges with rapid step;
but glory that depends on a woman's proclamations, perishes in a short-lived fate.
Quickly shall we know concerning the successions of the light-bearing lamps, of the beacon-lights and the fire, whether they were true, or whether this delightful light hath come, and, after the manner of dreams, mocked our minds.
I see this herald here, coming from the shore, o'ershadowed with boughs of olive;
and the thirsty dust, kin-sister of mud.
of the same yoke, bears witness to me of this, that neither voice­ less, nor by the smoke of fire, lighting up for you a flame of mountain-wood, he will make signals.
But he will either proclaim our joy to you more fully—for the tidings that are otherwise, I deprecate-for oh!
may a good sequel come to the good things that have appeared.
CH.
Whosoever, in this matter, prays otherwise for this our city, may he himself reap the fruit of his soul’s trespass.0 !
father-land of the soil1 of Argos, in this the light of the tenth year am I arrived, mastering one only hope, with many broken down.
For never dared I think that, dying.
I should share a burial dearest to me in this Argive land.
Now hail to thee, country mine, and hail to thee light of the sun, and to thee 0 Jove, supreme god of the realm, and to the Pythian king, that no longer with thy bow dost launch thy shafts against us.
Enough unfavouring comest2 thou by Scamander;
but now in turn be thou our saviour, and freer from our contests' and I address both all the gods of battle and my patron Mer­ cury, beloved herald, herald's glory, and the heroes that sent us forth, that they may kindly welcome back again the residue of the host that has escaped the spear.
0 halls of our kings, dear roofs !
and awful judgment-seat, and ye divinities that face the sun, if ever in the olden times ye did with these your bright eyes receive with honourable greeting our sovereign after his long absence;
for king Agamemnon is come, bringing a light in darkness common to you and to all these assembled.
-But greet him well, (and sooth 'tis fitting so) him that hath overturned Troy with the spade of avenging Jove with which the plain bath been tilled.
Their altars are demolished and the shrines of their gods and the seed of all the land hath utterly perished.
Having flung such a yoke over Troy, the elder royal son of Atreus, a happy man, hath arrived and most deserving to be honoured is he of the mortals of this day :
for neither Paris nor his accomplice-city boasts that their deed was greater than their suffering1.
For, cast in the penalty of abduction and theft, he both lost his gage2 and mowed down to the very earth in utter destruction the house of his father :
and the children of Priam have paid a double penalty.
CH. Joy to thee, Herald of the host of the Argives.
HER.
I feel joy;
and no longer do I refuse the gods to die.
CH.
Did love of this thy father-land train thee ?
HER.
Aye, so that mine eyes swim with tears of joy.
CH.
Ye were then smitten with this pleasant malady.
HER.
How?
learning [from thee] I shall master this speech3.
CH.
As being smitten with love for them who loved thee in turn.
HER.
Say'st thou that this country longed for the army which longed for it ?
CH.
Yes, so that full oft I sighed from my saddened soul.
HER.
Whence came this desponding horror on the people4 ?CH.
Long since have I considered silence as an antidote to mischief.
HER.
And how didst thou fear any5 when the chiefs were absent ?
CH.
Even as thou saidst just now, and to have died were matter of great thanks1.
HER.
Yea, for we have fared well.
But this in a long time one might say that some things fall out well, but others on the contrary are open to complaint;
for who, save the gods, is free from suffering throughout all time for ever­ more?
For were I to tell our hardships, and our bad lodgments, our approaches [to the shore] infrequent and ill.
bedded,—and in what part of the day were we not sighing, as not having met with our portion2 ?
—And then again the ills on shore were added, more loathly still:
for our beds were hard by the walls of our foes :
and from the sky and from the soil the meadow-dews drizzled on us, a deep rankling destruc­ tion to our garments making our hair shaggy.
And were any one to describe the winter, death to birds, how intolerable the snow of Ida made it, or the sultriness, when ocean, having sunk upon his noon-tide couch unruffled by a breeze, slumbered3 without a ripple.
-What need is there to grieve over this ?
the toil is past-past too with the dead is even the thought about ever hereafter rising.
Why need one take exact account of those that fell, and why should the sur­ vivor feel sorrowed on account of adverse hap ?
I deem it good to bid a long farewell to misfortunes.
With us, the remnant of the host of the Argives, the advantage preponderates, the suffering counterpoises not:
wherefore it is fair for us, flying over sea and land, to make our boast to this light of the sun. "
The armament of the Greeks, having at length captured Troy, have fixed these spoils as a glory to the ancient shrine4 of the gods throughout Greece."
Those that hear such tidings must glorify our city and our commanders;
and the favour of Jove, which hath brought this to pass, shall be honoured.
Thou hast my whole tale.
On.
I do not deny that I am overcome by thy tidings;
for to the aged there is ever youth enough to learn5.
'Tis natural that these things most of all concern the house and Clytæmnes­ tra, and that they at the same time make me rich.
Long since, in truth, I raised the jocund shout through delight, when the first mighty messenger of fire arrived, telling of the capture and overthrow of Ilion.
—And some one chiding me said, “ Dost thou, persuaded by beacon- lights, think that Troy has now been sacked?
Verily it is like a woman to be much elated in heart."
By words like these I was made to seem in error1.
Nevertheless I went on sacrificing;
and, by a woman's edict, one and another, in different places throughout the city, raised aloud a shout of joy, pouring forth a hallowed song in the dwelling of the gods, while they lulled the fragrant incense-fed flame.
And now what need is there for thee to say more to me ?
From the king himself I shall hear the whole tale.
And I will haste to welcome back my revered lord on his return as well as I pos­ sibly can :
for what day is more delightful for a woman to be­ hold than this, to throw open the gates to a husband returning from warfare, when a god hath kept him safe ?
Bear thou this message to my husband, that he come with all speed, desired oy the city.
And may he coming find a loyal consort in his house, just as he left her, a watch-dog of his home attached to him, a foe to the ill-disposed, and in -all other points alike, not having destroyed one single seal in the course of long time.
I know not delight nor slanderous report from another man any more than brass does of dyeing2.
[Exit.
CLYTÆMNESTRA.HER.
Such a boast as this, fraught with truth1, is not unseemly for a high-born dame to utter.
CH.
Thus bath she spoken, as beseems2 a clear inter­ preter.
to you that learn.
But do thou tell me, Herald !
I ask about Menelaus, whether he too returning and preserved will come back along with you, a chieftain beloved by this land3.
HER.
I cannot tell pleasant falsehoods, that my friends can enjoy for any length of time.
CH.
How then mightest thou, while telling good things, tell true4?
But 'tis full plain that these two things are severed.
HER.
The man is vanished from the Grecian armament, himself and vessel:
I tell no falsehood.
CH.
Was it when he was putting to sea from Ilion before your eyes, or did a tempest, a common bane, tear him away rom the host ?
HER.
Thou hast hit the mark like a capital archer, and hast expressed in brief a long sorrow.
On.
Was a rumour bruited by the rest of the mariners that he survived or had perished ?
HER.
No one knows, so as to report clearly except the sun that nurtures earth's nature.
CH. Why!
How dost thou say that the tempest came upon the naval armament, and ended through the wrath of heaven ?
HER.
It is not seemly to sully with a tongue of evil tidings an auspicious day.
The honour of the gods is distinct1.
But when a messenger with doleful countenance brings to a city sufferings of a defeated army to be deprecated,-that one public wound has befallen the state and that many men out of many families have been devoted2 to the double scourge which Mars loves,­ a doubly-speared calamity, a gory yoke.-well in good truth does it befit one that is laden with such sufferings to utter this hymn of the Furies;
but a glad messenger of saved fortunes coming to a city that is exulting in prosperity,-how shall I dash good news with ill, while I tell of the tempest that fell upon the Greeks, not free from heaven's wrath?
For fire and sea.
of old most deadly foes, conspired together, and proved their faithful plight, destroying the hapless armament of the Greeks.
And in the night, dire terrors of the waves were aroused.
For Thraeian blasts dashed the ships one against the other;
and they, violently struck by the beaks of other vessels through the whirlwind's rage, along with rain-lashed surge, dis­ appeared under the whirling steerage of an evil shepherd3.
But when the brilliant light of the sun arose, we behold the Ægæan deep blossoming with the corpses of Grecian men and wrecks of vessels.
For us, indeed, and our vessel undamaged in her hull, some god stole us away or begged us off* seizing our helm.
And Saviour Fortune took her seat, managing our vessel, so that we neither encountered the swell of waves at our anchor­ age, nor dashed on the rocky strand.
And having escaped a watery grave, in a white-dawning day, not crediting our for­ tune, we beguiled in anxious thoughts the recent mishap of our host worn out, and evilly crushed in ruin.
And now, if any of them is still breathing, they talk of us as perished,— why should they not?—we too fancy that they have met the same fatel.
But be it as best it may.
For Menelaus, therefore, expect that he will arrive first and above all;
for if any ray of the sun knows that he lives and sees, through the plans of Jove that bath not yet willed to utterly destroy the race, there is some hope that he will come again to his home.
Having heard thus much, know that thou hast heard the truth2.
[Exit HERALD.
CHORUS.
Who then did name thus truthfully in all points —was it one whom we see not, successfully guiding his tongue in foreknowledge of destiny?
—Helen3 the bride of the spear and the object of strife ?
since, fitly (styled) a hell to ships, a hell to men, a hell to cities;
did she sail away from her dainty woven tapestries4 with the breeze of earth-born Zephyr:
and many huntsmen, equipped with bucklers, [sailed] in the direction of the vanished track of oars, and brought their barks to land at the woodland banks of Simoïs, because of the bloody quarrel.
'Twas Wrath who accomplishes her purposes that brought to Ilion a "care5" correctly named, avenging at a late season the dishonour of the board, and of Jove, guardian of the hearth, punishing them who loudly honoured the marriage song, which then befell the nuptial party to sing.
But the Priam's ancient city, now taught another song, is wailing.
I ween, in loud lament calling Paris .
the ill-wedded, having all the time before led a life of many laments, because, of the hapless blood of her inhabitants.
Even thus a man hath reared a lion a pest to his house, unfed by milk, yet loving1 the teat;
at the outset of its life gentle, loved pet of the children, and the delight of the aged;
and oftentimes was he dandled in their arms like a baby nursling, with a face that brightened to [the outstretched] hand, and fawning through the cravings of appetite.
But advanced in age, he displayed the disposition of his parents;
for by way of making a return for his nurture, an unbidden guest he hath prepared a banquet by crunching2 slaughters of sheep, and the house hath been dabbled in gore;
a sorrow not to be resisted by the domestics, a mighty widely slaying pest;
and by the will of God some minister of Atè hath been fostered in his house.
In like manner I should say that there arrived in the city of Ilion the spirit of a breathless calm.
a gentle idol of wealth, darting the tender shaft from her eyes, the soul-piercing flower of love:
and couching by his side she accomplished the fell issue of her marriage, sweeping down upon the children of Priam, an evil neighbour, an evil associate, an Erinnys, cause of tears to brides under the behest of Xenian Jove.
There is amoug mankind an old say­ in,,, uttered in ancient times, that the great happiness of man at its consummation begets an offspring, nor childless dies;
and that from good fortune there sprouts forth for posterity insatiate calamity.
But I, apart from others, am single in my opinion;
for the impious deed afterwards begets3.
many more like to its own race.
But the lot of families that are swayed by unbending justice is ever fair in progeny.
But.
ancient insolence is wont to engender in the wicked among mortals insolence that sprouts afresh one time or another, when the doomed hour arrives:
fresh Insolence [is wont to engender] darkness from' light, the unconquerable fiend unhallowed Daring in the halls of black Atè2, like to its parents.
But Justice beams in smoky cottages and honours the holy life:
and leaving, with averted eyes, gilded prosperity with impurity of hands, she is wont to draw nigh to holiness, not honouring the power of wealth when falsely stamped with praise, and she directs every thing towards the issue.
Come, 0 king!
sacker of Troy, offspring of Atreus, how shall I greet thee, how shall I do thee reverence, so as neither to overstep nor to fall short of the due meed of affection?
3
Many among mortals prefer the semblance of good while they transgress justice.
And to sigh over him that is in adversity every one is ready, but the gnawing of sorrow reaches not to their heart.
And with a like appearance they unite in the joy of others, forcing their unsmiling countenances.
But who­ ever well knows his flock4, it is not possible that the eyes of a man who seems from kindly feeling to fawn in watery friend­ liness should escape him.
Thou too, at that time when fitting forth the armament in Helen's cause, (for I will not conceal it from thee.) wast [to my eyes] pourtrayed most gracelessly, and as ill guiding the helm of thy thoughts in forcing on men doomed to die a constrained valour.
But now to us who have ended, (their toils) the labour seems to have been in good will, (as we confess) not from light impulse, nor without friendly disposition*.
And in time, after thorough inquiry, thou wilt know both him of the citizens that Lath justly, and him that hath unduly administered the affairs of the city.
AGAM.
First of all it is right to salute Argos and the gods of the land that were joint authors of my return, and of the redress which I exacted from the city of Priam:
for the gods, not hearing our plea from the tongue, flung without hesitation into the gory vase their ballots, the destruction of Ilion fatal to men, and o'er the opposite urn that was not filled by the hand Hope hovered.
And now, still the city by its smoke shews evidently that it has been captured.
The storms of Atè are alive;
and the embers, dying along with the city, send forth rich exhalations of wealth.
For these things it behoves us to repay ever mindful gratitude to the gods;
since we both formed for ourselves1 a proud gin of conquest, and in a woman's cause the Argive monster bath levelled the city with the dust,-the young of the horse, the host equipped with shield, that leaped a furious bound, about the setting of the Pleiades, and the ravening lion springing over the towers bath lapped his fill of princely blood.
To the gods have I lengthened out this my prelude, but in regard to thy feeling I remember to have heard it;
and I say the same things, and thou hast me for thy fellow pleader.
For to few men is this congenial, to honour without jealousy a friend in prosperity;
for malignant venom having settled upon his heart doubles the pains of the man diseased:
he is both weighed down by his own sufferings, and sighs as he looks upon the happiness of another.
I will say so from experience-for well do I know-that those who professed to be kindly in the extreme to me were but the mere looking-glass of friendship, shadow of a shade.
And Ulysses alone, who sailed against his will, once yoked was to me a ready yoke-fellow1.
This do I say, whether I am speaking of one that is dead or living:
-for the rest, as concerns the city and the gods, we will deliberate having appointed a public debate in full assembly;
and measures must be taken that what is well may remain permanently.
And also, whatsoever stands in need of healing remedies, either cauterizing it, or cutting with kindly intent, we will endeavour to turn aside the pain of the disorder.
But now, having entered my halls, and the mansion of my hearth, I will first of all greet the gods, who as they have sent me forth, have brought me back again.
And may Victory, since she bath attended me, remain firmly with me.
Men !
Citizens !
ye elders of Argos present here2, I am not ashamed to tell you my fond feelings for my spouse-in course of time bashfulness dies away in men :
not having learned from others I will describe my own insupportable life, during the whole long time that this [my lord] was beneath the walls of Ilion.
First of all, it is dreadful evil for a woman to sit de­ solate in her dwelling without her mate, hearing many adverse tidings, how that one messenger has come, and another is bringing news in addition of another evil worse than the [former] evil, proclaiming them to the house.
And had this my husband met with as many wounds as report conveyed to his home, he would have been pierced more full [of holes] than a net, so to say.
And had he died as tales were rife, i'faith he might have boasted that he a second Geryon had received a mighty threefold vest of earth, above ground, for I forsooth speak not of that beneath the earth-dying once in each forms.
By reason of such cross rumours did others loosen forcibly many nooses from my neck (fastened) from aloft, having seized upon me1.
Hence, for this reason, the boy Orestes, the warrant of our mutual troth.
stands not here at my side as he should have done ;
nor marvel thou at this;
for our kind spear-guest Strophius the Phocian is rearing him, who forewarned me of twofold mischiefs-both thine own peril beneath the walls of Troy, and lest perchance some public burst of anarchy might overthrow the senate, since it is inborn in mortals to spurn the rather him who falls:
such excuse, believe me, brings no wile.
In me, indeed, the gushing fountains of my weeping have been exhausted, not even a drop is left.
I bear too marrings of mine eyes, late closed in slumber, bewailing the lamp kept burning for thy sake ever unheeded2 :
and in my dreams I was awakened by the light flitting of the buzzing gnat, seeing more sufferings befall thee3 than could possibly have happened during my time of sleep4.
—Now having en­ dured all these horrors, I will, with a soul not sorrowful, call this my husband, a watch-dog of the folds, a saving main­ stay of the ship, a foundation pillar of the lofty roof, an only child to parent, a land that hath appeared to mariners beyond their hopes, a day most fair to look upon after tempest, a gushing rill to a thirsty wayfarer5.
And delightful 'tis to have escaped from all constraint.
With such salutations then, as these, do I honour him.
But be envy far away ;
for many are the previous ills we have endured.
And now I pray thee beloved one, step forth from out this car, not planting on the bare ground, my liege, thy foot that trod down Ilion.
Maidens, why do ye delay, on whom hath been imposed the charge of strewing the surface of the way with tapestry?
Let a purple-strawn path be made forthwith, that Justice may usher him into his unlooked-for home1.
And for the rest my care, not overcome by slumbering, shall by favour of the gods order aright what hath been decreed.
AGAM.
Daughter of Leda, guardian of my dwelling, thou hast spoken suitably to my absence ;
for thou hast eked out thy greeting to a great length:
but to praise becomingly, this honour must come from others.
And for the rest, pamper me not after the fashions of women, nor as though I were a barbaric monarch, gape-out to me an outcry of earth-prostrate [homage] :
nor make my path obnoxious to the evil eye by strewing it with vestments.
With these indeed it is fitting to honour the gods :
but for one that is a mortal to walk on embroidered purple, is for me by no means free from dread ;
I bid thee reverence me as a man, not a god.
Without carpetings and gay fineries my fame speaks clearly forth;
and to be free from evil thoughts is God's best gift.
But we should call him happy that has ended his life in beloved prosperity2.
And if I shall fare3 thus in all things, I shall be of good confidence.
CLYT.
And yet say not thus against my fancy.
AGAM.
Rest assured that I will not spoil my resolution.
CLYT.
Didst thou pray to the gods, fearing that thou would'st act.
thus in this point1 ?
AGAM.
If ever man did, be sure that I have with perfect knowledge uttered this as my final decision.
CLYT.
And what thinkest thou Priam would have done, had he achieved this triumph ?
AGAM.
I think in truth he would have stalked upon embroidery.
CLYT.
Do not now stand in awe of the censure of men.
AGAM.
Yet sure at all events the voice of popular clamour h'is mighty power.
CLYT.
Aye, but he that is not envied is not worthy of admiration.
AGAM.
Truly, 'tis not a woman's duty to be fond of contest.
CLYT
Yet surely in the blest even to yield is becoming.
AGAM.
And dost thou value the victory in this strife ?
CLYT.
Yield thee ;
give me the victory cheerfully.
AGAM.
Well, if thou will have it so, let some one loose quickly my sandals, that do service to the treading of my foot, lest some envy from the eyes of the gods afar smite me as I trample in these sea-grained vestments, for 'tis great shame to waste my substance, by spoiling with my feet my wealth, and tissues bought with silver.
Thus much for this ;
but do thou with kindness conduct within this stranger maid :
God from afar graciously regards him that is mild in victory.
For no one willingly submits to the yoke of slavery.
But she, choice flower of many possessions, gift of the army, hath accompanied me.
Since then I have been reduced to submit to thee in this, I will go into the halls of my palace, treading on purple.
CLYT.
There is a sea—and who shall drain it ?—that breeds the drops of abundant purple, worth its weight in silver, con­ stantly renewed, the dye of vestments.
To thy house, 0 king, belongs good store of these by the gods' gifts, and thy dwelling knows not a want [of them].
I would have vowed the trampling of many vestments, had it been enjoined me in the prophetic shrines when I was planning ransoms for this life of thine.
For while the root exists, foliage springs in the house extending over them a shade against the do- Sirius;
and when thou comest to the hearth of thy home, thou showest to us a warmth that comes in winter.
But when Jupiter is making wine from the sour grapes, there is coolness even then in the house, when the master of a family revisits his own abode.
0 Jove,
Jove, that crownest all, bring my prayers to pass, and be it thy concern whatsoever thou art about to bring to pass.
CH.
Why o'er me doth this terror steadily hover close to my portent-boding heart, and in an unbought unbidden strain plays prophet, nor doth well-assured confidence take seat upon my heart's dear throne, after rejecting this like dreams hard of Interpretation ?
Long is the time since the naval armament with their cables cast firmly into the sandy shore, languished away2, when it was speeding to Ilion.
—And I learn their return from my eyes, being myself my own witness.
And yet, notwithstanding this, my soul within me, self-taught, is chanting the lament of an Erinnys unaccompanied by the lyre, in nought possessing the dear confidence of hope.
And my bosom tells no idle tale, my heart being whirled in eddies by just thoughts that have fulfilment.
But I pray that those, beyond my hope, may turn out to be false, so as to come to no fulfilment.
For verily the limit of abundant health is insa- tiable1.
For calamity presses upon it a close-adjoining neigh­ hour, and a man's destiny * * * holding on in a straightfor­ ward course, is apt to dash upon an unseen reef.
And if timidity, fling away a part, with a well-measured cast of the sling, in defence of its wealth in possession, the entire fabric sinks not, teeming too full of woe, nor does it make the bark to founder.
Often, in sooth, an ample boon from Jove, and from the yearly furrows, quells the pangs of famine.
But who can recall by charms a man’s black death-shed blood, when once it has fallen on the ground before [his feet] ?
Otherwise Jove would not have put an end to the leech2 that knew the right way to bring back the departed into safety.
And if Fate ordained by the gods did not prevent my fate3 availing more, my heart, having ontstripped my tongue, would have poured forth the tale ;
but now it moans beneath the gloom, soul grieving, and entertaining no farther hope of ever unravelling any thing seasonable, while my mind is kindled with inward flame.
Do thou betake thyself within too—I mean thee, Cas­ sandra;
since Jove in no wise wrathful hath made thee to be a partaker of the layers in our house, along with many slaves, placed near the altar of the god of property;
step forth from out this car, and be not high-minded.
For in truth they say, that even Alcmena's son once upon a time submitted to be sold, and against his will to put his hand to the yoke.
If then the destiny.
of this condition befall any, great is the advantage of having masters of old-established opulence.
But they who, without having ever expected it, have reaped a rich harvest, are' both stern in all things to their slaves, and go beyond the line.
With us you have such things as are regular..CH.
To thee she leaves off speaking clear words, and now that thou art within the toils of destiny, yield thee, if thou canst yield;
but perchance thou mayest be unyielding.
CLYT.
But if she be not, like a swallow, endowed with an unintelligible barbaric voice, speaking to her mind I am per­ suading her with my speech.
CH. (to Cassandra.)
Follow her;
she says what is best for thee of the things that are at present in thy power;
yield thee, and leave this thy seat in the ear.
CLYT.
Nay, I have no time to linger here with her outside the door, for the sheep are already standing ready for the sacrifice of the fire of the central hearth, inasmuch as we never hoped to have this joy;
and if thou wilt do aught of this my bidding, delay not.
But if, not understanding, thou apprehendest not my speech, do thou, instead of voice signify it to me with thy barbarie hand.[
CLYTÆMNESTRA endeavours, by waving her hand, to make CASSANDRA understand that sCe should qo into the palace.
CH.
The stranger seems to stand in need of a clear inter­ preter:
and her behaviour is as of a wild beast newly taken.
CLYT.
Aye, surely she is raving, and lends an ear to evil thoughts, she that bath come here after leaving a city newly taken;
and she knows not how to bear the bit, before that she foams away her bloody mettle:
—in truth I'll not submit to be insulted in wasting more [words].
[CLYTÆMNESTRA goes in.
On.
But I, for I pity thee, will not be angry with thee.
Come, wretched one, having left this ear empty, submitting to this thy doom, hansel the yoke.
On.
Why sayest thou, Woe! for Loxias ?-for he is not such [a god] as to have a mourner.
CH.
She with ill-omened outcry is again invoking the god not suited to stand by in wailings.
CAS.
Apollo!
Apollo!
Aguieus1!
Apollo mine!
for thou hast without difficulty destroyed me the second time.
CH.
She seems to be upon the point of divining, touching her own ills.
Divination remains even in the mind of a slave.
CAS.
Apollo !
Apollo !
Aguieus !
destroyer mine !
ah !
whither canst thou have brought me?
to what kind of dwelling ?
On.
To that of the Atreidæ:
if thou perceivest not this, I tell it thee, and thou shalt not pronounce this to be a false­ hood.
CAS.
A godless one, then, privy to many murderous horrors of kin on kin, and halters2, a human shambles, and a dripping floor.
CH.
The stranger maiden seems to be keen-scented, like a hound, and to be seeking whose blood she may discover.
CAS.
For I trust to these testimonies here before me ;
these babes here, bewailing the butchery, and their roasted flesh eaten by their parents.
On.
Verily we had heard of thy renown as a prophetess;
but we seek not for prophets.
CAS.
Alas !
alas !
0 gods, what is it that one is designing;
what is this new great sorrow, a great horror that one is designing in this dwelling-past the endurance of friends beyond all remedy;
but help stands far aloof.
On.
I am unskilled in these prophetic bodings—but those I understand, for the whole city bruits them.
CAS.
Alas!
wretched woman!
for thou wilt perpetrate this, having made thy lord, the partner of thy bed, sleek with the bath:
how shall I tell the issue?
for quickly shall this take place;
and hand after hand is she stretching forth and clutching.
CH.
Nor yet do I understand thee;
for now I am .bewil­ dered by oracles obscure with their riddling strain.
CAS.
Ha!
faugh!
faugh!
what appears here?
Is It some net of Hades?
But its closed snare is the partner of a bed, the accomplice in the murder:
and let the unglutted quire yell over the race, because of the murder that deserves stoning.
CH.
What kind of Erinnys is this that thou art summoning to sound her trumpet-blast over the house ?
thy words cheer me not:
and to my heart has run the drop of saffron dye, which also, in the last hour of man, keeps pace with the rays of the setting sun of life.
But calamity comes on apace.
CAS.
Ah ! ah ! lo there!
lo there!
keep the bull from the cow;
having caught him with his black horns in robes by a stratagem, she is smiting him;
and he falls in the brimming laver.
I tell thee of the fortune of the stealthy-murdering caldron.
CH.
I cannot boast of being a sharp judge of weird words, but I liken these to some misfortune.
And from weird words what good tidings are sent to mortals ?
by means of weird­ song wordy lore brings evil terror [for us] to learn.
CAS.
Alas!
alas !
ill-fated hap of miserable me !
for I blend my own woe [ with his], and lament.
To what purpose was it that thou didst bring me hither?
to none whatever, but that I should die with thee;
how not ?
Cn.
Thou art a maniac possessed;
and touching thyself dost wail a strain unmusical, like a dun nightingale insa­ tiate of song, alas!
in her wretched soul bewailing Itys, Itys, through her life thick-teeming with woes.
CAS.
Alas for the fate of the clear-voiced nightingale!
for the gods invested her with a winged form, and a delightful life, free from lamentations;
but me there awaits a cleaving blow with a two-edged axe.
CH.
Whence hast thou ungovernable woes, bursting impe­ tuously on thee, with wanderings of speech1, and sent by the gods?
and whence is it that thou modellest in song thy horrors with dismal-omened outcry, and at the same time with shrill- sounding lays ?
whence dost thou ken the ill-boding bounda­ ries of the prophetic path ?
CAS.
Alas for the nuptials, the nuptials of Paris, destructive to his friends!
alas for my native waters of Scamander.
Then indeed on thy banks I, wretched, throve in my rearing;
but now beside the Cocytus.
and on the banks of Acheron, it seems that I must speedily chant my propheciesCH.
What is this but too distinct saying thou hast uttered?
a child might understand it.
And I am stricken beneath with a murderous pang, while thou plaintively wailest in thy sad sorrowing lot, wonders for me to hear.
—CAS.
Alas for the sufferings, the sufferings of my city that­ bath utterly perished!
Alas for the sacrifices of my sire­ in behalf of his towers, slaughterers of many pasturing­ cattle!
but no remedy sufficed to prevent its suffering, even as it now lies.
I too, with soul on fire, shall speedily fling myself on the ground.
On.
These words hast thou uttered in unison with those before them.
And some evil-thinking god falling upon thee heavily, makes thee chaunt sufferings, lamentable, deadly.
But for the issue I am at a loss.
CAS.
Nay, but the oracle no songer shall be peering forth from a veil' after the manner of a new-married bride ;
but clear it seems it will come, blowing towards the rising of the sun, so that a woe much greater than this will, like a wave, dash up against the light.
And no longer will I instruct thee by means, of enigmas.
And do you, coursing with me, bear witness how I scent the track of evils wrought of old.
For a quire that sings in concert, not sweetly, (for 'tis not of good they sing,) never at any time leaves this palace here before us.
And truly, having quaffed human blood, so as to riot more, a revel of sister Furies abides in the house, hard to be sent forth :
and as they sit on the house-top they hymn a hymn2, the ancestral curse :
and they in turn loathe the brother's coueh.
deadly to him that trampled on it.
Did I miss, or hunt I ke some archer?
or am I a lying, street-door, babbling witch ?
Testify to me, after first making oath that I accu­ rately know the ancient iniquities of the palace.
CH.
And how can oath, a pledge honourably pledged1, heal the mischief?
But I marvel at thee, that, bred beyond the sea, thou shouldst succeed in speaking to a city of strange tongue, just as if thou hadst been present.
CAS.
The prophet Apollo appointed me to this office.
On.
What!
was he, a god, smitten with a passion for youCAS.
Heretofore I was ashamed to tell this tale2.
CH.
Aye, for every one that is very prosperous grows delicate.
CAS.
But he was an eager suitor, breathing strong love for me.
CH.
Did you even meet in wedlock ?
CAS.
Having consented, I deceived him.
CH.
Wast thou already possessed of inspired lore?
CAS.
I was even then predicting all their sufferings to my countrymen.
CH.
How then wast thou unscathed by the wrath of Loxias?
CAS.
I used to win no one's credence in any thing, after I had committed this trespass.
CH.
Yet to us at all events thou seemest to utter things worthy of belief.
CAS.
HO!
ho!
alas!
alas!
oh miseries!
again the dread task of true prophecy is racking me, troubling me with the pre­ ludings of predictions.
See ye these infants sitting' here on the palace, like to the phantoms of dreams ?-children just as if they had perished by the hands of their friends,-their hands crammed with the meat of their own flesh;
and they stand forth holding their bowels along with their entrails, a piteous mess, of which their father tasted3.
For this, I tell you, that a craven lion, wallowing in his lair, haunting his home, ah me!
is plotting retribution for him that is returned, —my master;
for I must needs bear the yoke of slavery.
And the commander of the ships, and the overturner of Ilion, knows not what things the tongue of the hateful bitch having uttered, and prolonged with fair-seeming purpose, like Atè lurking in secret, will obtain with evil success.
Such horrors doth she dare;
a woman is the murderer of a man1.
What hateful monster may I rightly call her?
an amphisbæna, or a Scylla that, dwells among the rocks, the pest of mariners' vessels, a raving dam of Hades, and breathing to her friends a truceless curse2 ?
And how she, full of all daring, shouted over him, like in the turn of the fight!
Yet she feigns that she rejoices in the safety of his return.
And 'tis all one if I convince you nought of these things;
for what matters it?
That which will be will come.
Thou too, present there, shalt pitying pronounce me but too true a prophetess3.
On.
The banquet of Thyestes on his children's flesh I understand, and I shudder at it;
and terror possesses me while I hear it truly told, in nothing feigned:
but when I hear the rest I lose the track.
CAS.
I say that thou shalt witness the death of Agamem­ non.
On.
Wretch!
lull thy ill-omened tongue in silencc4.
GAS.
But the god of healing presides not over this de­ claration.
CH.
No, if indeed it is to be;
but never may it be!
CAS.
Thou prayest indeed,-but murder is their care.
CH.
By what man is this sad deed' prepared?
CAS.
Verily, thou must have very much overlooked my acles.
On.
Like enough, for I understand not the device of the complisher.
CAS.
And yet verily I know the Grecian language too well2.CH:
Yes, and the Pythian oracles, and yet they are hard to understand.
CAS.
Ah me!
what a fire is that!
and it comes upon me!
Woe!
woe!
Lycæan Apollo, ah me!
ah me!
this biped lioness, that lay down with a wolf in the absence of the generous lion, will slay me, wretched woman;
and as though she were compounding poison she will add my price to her wrath3.
She boasts, while she whets the blade for her husband, that she will exact his murder as a punishment for having brought me hither.
Why then do I retain these mockeries of myself, my wands and my prophetic wreaths about my neck ?
[She tears away her chaplets, and casts them on the ground.]—I will destroy you before my own doom.
Go fall into destruc­ tion—thus will I rid myself of you;
enrich some other maiden with calamities in my room.
Lo, too, Apollo himself stripping me of my oracular vesture!
and having beheld me even in this array, idly laughed to scorn among my friends, by my foes with no changing of the scale!
I poor, wretched, dying of starvation, bore to be called vagrant, like a begging gipsy.
And now the prophet, having avenged himself on his prophetess.
hath brought me to these deadly woes.
And, in place of my sire's altar, a butcher's block awaits me, cut down, a hot reeking victim.
Yet.
verily, we shall not at all events die unhonoured of the gods.
For there shall come hereafter another avenger of our cause, a matricidal scion, avenger of his sire.
And he, a wandering exile, estranged from this land, shall return to place the coping-stone upon this curse for his friends;
for a mighty oath has been sworn by the gods1, that the prostrate corpse of his dead father shall bring him back.
Why truly do I wail here by the house, since I first saw the city of Ilion faring as it has fared, and they who captured the city come off thus according to the judgment of the gods;
I will go and do [my part,] I will dare to die;
and I accost these gates of Hades, and I make my prayer that I may receive a mortal clow, that without a struggle, while my blood in easy death flows aw ay, I may close mine eyes2.
On.
O woman most wretched and most wise, to a great length hast thou spoken.
But if thou truly knowest thine own doom, how is it that thou steppest with good courage to the altar, like a heifer led by heaven ?
CAS.
There is no escape, strangers, nothing is to be gained by time3.
CH.
Yet the last has the advantage in time.
CAS.
This day has arrived;
'tis little I shall gain by flight.
CH.
Be sure, thou hast stout resolution in thy undaunted spirit.
CAS.
Yet to die gloriously is surely a gratification to a mortal.
CH.
No one hears these sentiments from the happy4.
CAS.
Alas, my sire, for thee and for thy noble children!
CH.
What is the matter?
what terror turns thee away?
On.
Why criest thou, faugh!
unless there be something which thy heart loaths ?
CAS.
The palace reeks with blood-dripping murder.
CH.
How sayest thou?
this is the smell of victims at the hearth.
CAS.
'Tis plainly like a fume from the grave.
On.
No Syrian luxury art thou describing in the house.
CAS.
But I will go to shriek over my own destiny and that of Agamemnon also within the palace.
Enough of life.
Alas, strangers!
Yet do I not vainly quail in terror, like a bird at a bush1.
Do ye bear this testimony to me dying, when a woman shall perish for me a woman, and a man shall fall for one that was ill-mated.
These boons I claim from you as on the point of death.
CH. Wretched one, I pity thec for thy predicted doom.
CAS.
Yet once more do I wish to utter a speech, or mine own dirge2.
And (looking upon) his light for the last time, I pray the sun, upon my hated murderers, that they may at the same time pay the penalty for a slave, that dies an easy victim, to my avengers their murderers3.
Alas for the condition of mortals!
them when prosperous a shadow may overturn;
but if they be in adversity, a moistened sponge blots out the picture:
and for this I have far greater pity thau for that.
[CASSANDRA enters the palace.]
CHORUS.
To be thriving indeed, is by nature a glutless thing to all mortals;
and none will banish and keep it from their dwelling that all point out1, saying these words, " Enter here no more."
And to this our sovereign the blessed gods have granted to capture the city of Priam;
and he returns to his home honoured by heaven.
Yet if now he is to pay the price of the bloodshed of his predecessors, and dying for the dead accomplish to the full the vengeance2 due for the deaths of others, who among mortals that hears this tale would not pray to be born with an innocuous genius3?
AGAMEMNON (within.)
Woe's me!
I'm stricken a mortal blow within!
CH.
1. Hush!
who is it that cries out "a blow," mortally wounded?
AGAM Woe's me, again!
struck with a second blow.
CH. 2. To me it seems, from the cry of the king, that the deed hath been done1.
CH. 3. But let us in some way or other concert unfailing measures.
CR. 4. I tell you what is my resolve, to summon the townsmen hither to the palace for a rescue.
CH. 5.
But to me it seems best that we should, as quick as possible, burst in and detect the deed by the fresh-dripping sword.
CH. 6. And I agreeing in such an opinion, vote that we do something-and high time it is that we dally not.
CH.
7. We may see that plainly;
for they are preluding, as though displaying signs of a tyranny over the city.
CH. 8. Aye, for we are tardy2:
but they, trampling to the ground the reputation of delay, are not slumbering in hand.
CH. 9. I know not what plan I have to tell you-'tis the doer's part also to take counsel.
CH. 10. I too am in the same state, since I am unable to raise the dead again by my words.
CH. 11. What!
shall we prolong our lives thus submitting to these rulers that disgrace the house ?CH. 12. Nay, 'tis beyond endurance;
to die is better;
for 'tis a milder doom than tyranny.
On. 13. Shall we augur as though the king has perished, on proofs drawn from outcries?
CH. 14.
We ought to speak of these things, having clear knowledge;
for to guess is distinct from clearly knowing.
CH. 15.
I am inclined on all accounts to recommend that we clearly learn how Atrides fares3.
Though many things have been before spoken as suited the occasion, I shall not blush to speak the contrary.
For how else could one, while providing enmity for enemies, construct for those that seem friends dense snares of mischief, a height too great to overleap?
and this struggle of an ancient feud came not on me without having been long since meditated, though certainly late.
And I stand where I struck him,—now the deed is done and over1:
I did it too in such a way-and this I will not deny-that he could neither escape nor ward on his doom.
I stake around an endless net, as if for fishes, the deathly treasure of a vesture.
And I smite him twice, and with two groans he dropped his limbs, and on him fallen I add a third blow, a votive offering to him beneath the earth, Hades, the guardian of the dead.
Thus he gulps away2 his own soul as he falls;
and gurgling forth the sharp gush of the shedded blood, he smites with black drops of gory dew me that rejoiced no less than the sown [land] does in Jove's rich gift3 during the travails of the ear.
Since then 'tis thus, oh elders of Argos present here, rejoice ye, if ye can rejoice, for I glory in the deed.
And were it possible becomingly4 to make libation over the corpse, this would be justly done-full justly, sure, he who bath filled up a cup of so many accursed ills in his home, should drain it on his return.
CH.
We marvel at thy tonguc, how bold thy language is, thou that dost boast in such words over thy husband.
CLYT.
Ye are trying me like a senseless woman;
but I say with heart undaunted to you that know,-and 'tis all one whether thou wilt praise or censure,-this is Agamemnon, my husband, and a corpse-the deed of this right hand of mine, a righteous agent.
Thus this thing stands.
CH.
What horrid poison nourished by the earth, woman!
or drink coming from the flowing, sea, hast thou tasted, that thou laid on thyself this sacrifice and public curse'
Thou hast cast him off, thou hast cut him off;
and an outlaw shalt thou be, a fearful abhorrence to thy countrymen.
CLYT.
Now indeed thou adjudgest me to endure banishment from the city, and the abhorrence of the citizens, and public execrations,—thou that didst formerly bring nothing against this man, who, making no account of her fate, as it were of a brute, while sheep abounded in fleecy folds, immolated his own daughter, the dearest to me of my child-birth pangs, as a charm for the Thracian blasts.
Shouldst thou not have banished that person out of this land, in retribution for his foul deeds?
but now that thou hearest of my deeds, thou art a stern judge.
But this I tell thee--Menace me as knowing that I am prepared on equal terms,-that when thou hast got the victory with thy hand, thou mayest rule me3;
—but if God bring the contrary to pass, thou shalt, though late, be taught to know discretion.
CH.
Thou art lofty in spirit, and proud things hast thou uttered:
thy soul is raving as under a blood- dripping fate4, an unavenged blood-clot is conspicuous on thy brow.
Yet must thou hereafter, bereft of thy friends, atone for stroke by stroke5.
CLYT.
And thou shalt hear this plea of mine oath:
By the perfect vengeance of my daughter, by Atè, and Erinnys, to whom I sacrificed this man, I expect not to tread the hall of Terror, so long as Ægisthus burns fire on my hearth, well­ disposed to me as heretofore:
for he is to me no small shield of confidence.
He lies, the marrer of this woman, the minion of the Chryseids under Ilion :
and she here, his captive and soothsayer, and partner of his bed, his faithful love, the weird prophetess and sharer with him of the benches of the ships.
But these twain have not done deeds without a reward.
For he indeed [lies] thus;
and she too, his love, having like a swan warbled her last dying wail, to me she hath brought a nuptial dainty dish1 for my enjoyment.
SEM.
Alas!
what doom, not of sharp extreme anguish, nor keeping to the couch, may come with speed, bringing upon us the endless sleep that is for ever, now that my most gracious guardian has been smitten down, and after having suffered much in a woman's cause ?
by a woman's hand too he lost his life.
CH2. Woe!
0 frenzied Helen, who alone didst work the destruction of the many, the very many lives beneath Troy.
SEM.
NOW too, thou hast perfectly accomplished by an inexpiable murder the memorable strife-begotten strife which formerly existed in the house, a bane to its master3.
CLYT.
Do not, afflicted for these things, pray for the doom of death, nor divert thine indignation upon Helen, as though she, the man-destroyer, as though she singly, having brought to an end the lives of many men, had wrought a most incurable sorrow.
SEM.
0 daemon, that fallest on this dwelling, and the double line of Tantalus, and through women exertest a prowess matching mine4, that gnaws my heart.
And stand- in- over the corpse in defiance of what is right, like an odious raven in my eyes, she exults to hymn her hymn.
**CLYT.
Now hast thou corrected the judgment of thy mouth in naming the thriee-great dæmon of this race:
for through aim is the lust for lapping blood fostered in its vitals :
before that the old sorrow comes to an end there is fresh blood­ shed.
SEM.
Verily thou praisest the mighty daemon of this house­ hold, dreadful in his wrath.
Alas!
alas for the horrible praise of calamity ever greedy!
Woe!
woe !
'tis by the will of Jove, cause of all, doer of all:
for what is accomplished among mortals without Jove ?
what of these things is not decreed by heaven rOn.
Woe!
woe!
My king!
my king!
How shall I mourn thee ?
what shall I utter from my affectionate soul ?
But thou liest in this web of the spider, breathing forth thy life by an impious death.
SEM.
Ah me!
for this slave-like couch;
smitten down by a death from a treacherous hand, with a two-edged weapon.
CLYT.
Thou vauntest that the deed was mine.
But reckon not that I am the spouse of Agamemnon.
No!
but the ancient ruthless evil genius of Atreus, cruel banqueter, likened to the wife of this dead man, bath visited him with his vengeance, having paid a full-grown victim for infants.
SEM.
That thou art guiltless of this murder, who will testify ?
How ?
how ?
yet the evil genius of his fathers might abet thee.
And the wretched battle-god is hurried violently onward in torrents of kindred blood;
making his way where he must give course to the clotted gore of children slam for food1.
On.
Woe !
woe !
My king !
my king!
how shall I mourn thee ?
What shall I utter from my affectionate soul ?
But thou liest in this web of the spider breathing forth thy life by an impious death.
SEM.
Ah me !
for this slave-like couch !
thou wast smitten down by death from a treacherous hand, with a two-edged weapon.
CLYT.
I do not think that a slave-like death has befallen him1;
for did not he bring insidous Atὲ to his dwelling ?
But as he wrought upon my scion that was raised from him, Iphigenia, child much lamented, things worthy such deserts2 he hath suffered ;
let him not proudly vaunt himself in Hades, having atoned by the death of the sword for deeds he first wrought.
SEM.
Bereft of counsel I am bewildered in well-concerted anxious thought as to which way I may betake myself, now the house is sinking;
and I dread the dashing of the gory shower that saps the dwelling, and it no longer falls in drops.
And destiny for another deed of ill is whetting vengeance on other whetstones.
CH. Woe!
Oh earth, earth!
would that thou hadst re­ ceived me before I had beheld this [my king] stretched on lowly floor of the silver-sided bath.
Who shall bury him ?
who shall lament him ?
Wilt thou dare to do this, after having murdered thine own husband-to pour the loud wail over his life, wrongfully to perform a graceless grace in atonement for thy bold deeds3 ?
SEM.
And who, pronouncing with tears the funeral panegyric4 over the godlike man, shall wail in sincerity of soul ?
CLYT.
It concerns not thee to speak of this care:
by our hands he fell, he met his fate, and we will inter him.
not with wailings from his dwelling, *** but his daughter Iphigenia.
as is proper, having met her father lovingly at the swift- flowing stream of woes, shall fling her arms around and kiss him.
SEM.
This reproach comes in return for reproach;
and difficult it is to decide-one spoils the spoiler, and the slayer makes full atonement.
And there abides, so long as Jove abideth, [the rule] that the doer in time shall suffer.
For 'tis the statute5, Who can expel from the house the brood of curses?
the race is wedded to calamity.
CLYT.
He lighted6 on this oracle agreeably to truth.
And I. therefore, am willing to plight oaths with the dæmon of the Pleisthenidæ, to acquiesce in these things, all hard to endure though they be;
and for him, henceforth, quitting this dwelling, to wear out another race by kindred murders.
And a small portion of wealth is amply sufficient for me to possess, if I have put away the phrenzy of mutual murder from the halls.0 kindly light of the day that brings retribution.
Now I would pronounce that gods, the punishers of mortals from on high, look down upon the abominations of earth, beholding this man here lying, as is delightful to me, in the woven robes of the Furies, paying the penalty of the devices of his father's hand.
For Atreus, the ruler of this land, his father, being a rival about the power, that I may speak clearly, banished from his city and his house Thyestes my father, his own brother.
And wretched Thyestes, having come again a suppliant at the hearth, found a secure lot, so that he should not dying stain his paternal soil with his blood.
But Atreus, the godless father of this man, with more zeal than love, pretending cheerfully to hold a day of banqueting by way of welcome to my father, served him a banquet of his children's flesh.
The parts about the feet indeed, and the comb-like tips of the fingers, seated apart, he broke from those above'.
And.
having immediately in ignorance taken that part of the flesh which could not be distinguished, he eats a food, as thou seest, destructive to the race.
And then, having discovered the unholy deed, he screamed, and falls back from the butchery vomiting:
and on the descendants of Pelops he imprecates an intolerable doom, rightfully devoted to a curse the insult of the board2, so perish the whole race of Pleisthenes!
In consequence of these things you may see this man fallen:
and I am the righteous contriver of his slaughter, for he drives into exile me, the thirteenth child, along with my wretched sire.
being a little one in swaddling-clothes.
But Justice brought me back again when I had grown up.
And I have reached this man though I was at a distance, having put together every contrivance for the sad conspiracy.
Thus it is indeed glorious for me even to fall after I have seen him within the toils of Justice.
On.
Ægisthus !
I honour not insolence amidst guilt.
And dost thou say, that thou didst wilfully slay this man, and that thou alone didst plot this piteous murder?
I declare that thy head shall not escape, be sure of it, curses of stoning, hurled by the populace.
ÆGIS.
Dost thou say these things sitting at the lower oar, while those upon the middle bench1 of the vessel bear sway ?
Thou shalt know, old as thou art, how bitter it is for a man of thy years to be schooled, when discretion is prescribed him.
But bondage and the pangs of starvation are the best physi­ cians of the mind to school even old age.
Having eyes seest.
thou not this?
Kick not against the pricks, lest thou, stumbling, suffer.
On.
Woman!
didst thou, guardian of the house of this man just arrived from battle2, having at the same time defiled his bed, resolve on the destruction of this warrior-chief here ?
ÆGIS.
These words too are the first parents of mourning.
Thou hast a tongue quite opposite to that of Orpheus;
for he.
indeed, led all things along for joy of his voice.
whereas thou having angered us by thy silly yelpings3, shalt be dragged away:
but when overpowered thou wilt show thyself more tame.
On.
As if thou forsooth shouldst be sovereign of the Argives, thou, that when thou hadst resolved on his destruc­ tion, daredst not to do this deed by a stroke of thine own hand1:
ÆGIS.
Aye!
for to plot was plainly a woman's part;
and I, an ancient foe, was a suspicious object.
However, by means of this man's wealth, I will try to rule the citizens;
and the over-fed colt that is unruly, and draws not as I direct, I will yoke in heavy harnessl;
but famine, that dwells with hated darkness, shall see him softened.
CH. 0 why didst not thou thyself with thy dastard heart slay this man here ?
but his wife, a pollution of her country and her country's gods, killed him.
Does then Orestes any­ where behold the light, so that, returning hither under the guidance of gracious Fortune, he may become the mastering slayer of these twain?
ÆGIS.
Well, since thou art determined to act thus and use this language, thou shalt know quicklyCH.
Come on, comrades dear, this business is not far off.
CH. Come on, let each man have his drawn sword in readiness.
ÆGIS.
I'faith I refuse not to die with hand on hilt.
CH.
Thou talkest of dying to those who welcome the omen, and let us take our fortune.
CLYT.
By no means, dearest of men, let us perpetrate any further ills.
But to reap even these is in many respects a wretched harvest.
And enough of misery assuredly is ours;
let us not at all stain ourselves with blood.
Repair, old men, forthwith to your appointed2 homes, before you suffer by your deeds:
we must take these things and be contented with them since we did them;
and if any one has a share of troubles, we at all events shall have enough of these, miserably smitten by the dæmon in his fell wrath.
Such is a woman's advice, if any one condescends to heed it.
ÆGIS.
But that these men should thus blossom forth a fool­ ish tongue in my presence, and blurt forth such expressions, tempting their fate, and miss sobriety of judgment, and [insult] the ruler * * * * *CH.
This never can be the conduct of Argives, to fawn on the base.
ÆGIs.
Yet on some future day I will pursue thee yet.
CH.
Not so, if a divine power shall guide Orestes to come hither.
ÆGIS.
I know that exiles feed themselves on hopes.
On.
Do thy pleasure !

Rest assured that thou shalt make me a requital for this follyCH.

ORESTES, returning from Phocis, recognizes his sister offering libations at the tomb of Agamemnon, and with her concerts a plan for revenging their father's death.
Encouraged by the ill-omened dream of Clytæmnestra­ he resolves to enter the palace with his companion Pylades, and having deceived Clytemnæstra with a pretended account of his death, he wreaks vengeance upon her and Ægisthus.
The play concludes with his horror at the deed, and determination to go to Delphi to receive purification.
ORESTES.A NURSE.A DOMESTIC.
CHORUS OF CAPTIVE TROJAN WOMEN.ORESTES.
MERCURY of the shades !
presiding over the power delegated from the sire1, be thou a saviour and ally to me beseeching it;
for I am come into this land, and I return from exiled
And over this mound of his sepulchre too I call upon my father to listen, to give ear3.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * a ringlet cherished in honour of Inachus' and this, the second, expressive of my sorrow.
* * * * * * * * * * * * *
What is it that I see ?
what is this concourse of women [coming] hither conspicuous in sable weeds ?
To what calamity shall I refer it ?
Is it that a new death2 hath happened in the palace ?
or am I right in guessing that these maidens are conveying libations to my father-a propitiation for the departed3 ?
It is nothing else;
for I think I see my sister Electra advancing, distinguished by grievous sorrow.
0 Jupiter !
grant me to avenge the fate of my father, and be thou a willing ally to me !
Pylades, stand we apart, that I may clearly learn what means this suppliant procession of women.
CH.
I am come forth from the palace, sent as an escort to the drink-offering with the noise of sharp clapping of hands.
Marked is my cheek with bloody gashes, the furrow newly cut by my nail:
for ever is my heart fed on wailings;
and the rendings of tissues ruining the vesture, make a noise through my sorrows, the breast-protecting robes being torn through smileless woes.
For a thrilling, hair-stiffening panic, the dream-prophet of the house, breathing wrath in the midst of slumbers, echoed an outcry full fearfully at dead of night from the inmost apartments, falling heavy on the chambers of the women.
Interpreters too of these dreams, bound to veracity, declared on the part of the gods, that those beneath the earth are complaining full angerly and are wroth against their murderers.
Such an unkind kindness devising as an averter of ills, 0 Earth, mother!
does the godless woman send me.
But I dread to utter this word:
for what atone­ ment is there for blood that has fallen on the ground ?
Alas for the all unhappy hearth!
Alas for the ruin of the dwelling !
A gloom uncheered by the sun, abhorred of mortals, hides the house through the death of the master.
And majesty, which was in the olden time unconquered, invincible, unassailed, making its way through the ears and the mind of the people, is now banished.
And somebody1 is terrified.
But to be prosperous-this is both a god and more than a god among mortals.
And the swift turn of Justice visits some in daylight, and some lingering burst forth with violence in the interval of darkness, and some impracticable night possesses2.
Because of the blood that hath been drunk by the fostering earth, gore that cries for vengeance, is fast clotted so as never to be washed away.
A piercing bitter eurse destroys3 the author of the all-sufficing malady.
But [as] there is no remedy for maidenhood.
to its violater, [so] all the streams, moving in one course, flow in vain5 to purify murder of the foul hand.
But 'tis my lot, for the gods have visited me with the hardship of a eaptured city;
for they brought me to a slave's estate afar from the house of my fathers, to acquiesce in the things that seem fit to the lords over my life, just or unjust, [the deeds] of mastering the loathing of my soul, those who are violently borne along6.
But I weep beneath my robes at the hapless fortunes of my masters, chilled with secret sorrows.
ELECTRA.
Ye captive maids, ye garnishers of the palace, since ye are present as my associates in this suppliant procession, be my counsellors in this matter :
when I pour these funereal drink-offerings on the tomb, how shall I say what is well-pleasing ?
how am I to make my prayer to my father ?
Shall I say that I bring them from a dear wife to a dear husband ?
from my mother, forsooth1!
I dare not say it;
and I know not what to say, as I pour this thick libation on the tomb of my father.
Or shall I say this saying, as is the custom of mortals, that he would recompense those who send these chaplets and this gift with a [gift] worthy their misdeeds2 or, in silence, ingloriously, even as my father perished, am I, pouring this out, a draught drunk by the earth, to move backwards3, like one who casts forth offscourings, as I fling from me the vessel, with eyes never looking back ?
In this deliberation of mine, my friends, do ye be sharers, for we hold a common object of abhorrence in the house.
Hide not your feelings within your heart, through fear of any one.
For Destiny awaits alike the free man, and him that is mastered by the hand of another.
Tell me if thou knowest aught better than this ?
On.
Reverencing the tomb of thy sire as though an altar, I will speak, for thou biddest me, the sentiment of my soul.
EL. Speak, even as thou sayest thou reverencest4 the tomb of my father.
On.
Invoke, as thou pourest the offering, holy things upon the wellwishers.
EL.
And who are these friends whom I am to speak of?
CH.
First thyself, and whosoever abhors Ægisthus.EL.
Shall I then offer this prayer both for myself and for thee ?
CH.
Do thou thyself, already informed on these points, take counsel.
EL.
Whom else then shall I further add to this present company ?
On.
Be mindful of Orestes, albeit he is abroad.
EL. Well, and in no slight degree hast thou instructed me in this.
On.
Now to the guilty, mindful of the murder—EL.
What am I to say?
teach me unskilful, pointing out the way.
On.
That there might come to them some divinity, or some one of mortals.
EL. Meanest thou a judge, or an avenger ?
CH.
Say thou simply, one that shall slay in turn.
EL.
And are these things such as may religiously befall me from the gods ?
CH.
How not, to requite an enemy with evils?
EL.
Mercury of the realms below * * * * after summoning the divinities beneath the earth to give ear to my prayers, those that watch over the house of my fathers, and Earth her­ self, that brings forth all things, and, after rearing them, again receives their produce ;
and I pouring forth these lustral waters do say, calling on my sire:
mortals1, have pity on me, and on the dear Orestes, so that we may restore:
!
him to the palace.
For now, sold as it were by3 her that bare us, we are outcasts, and for a husband she hath taken in exchange Ægisthus, who was accomplice in thy murder.
And I, indeed, am as a slave, and from thy substance Orestes is an outcast, while they in mighty haughtiness are wantoning in the fruits of thy labours.
But I make my prayer to thee that Orestes may come hither with some success, and do thou.
0 my sire, give ear to me, and to myself vouchsafe that I may be by far more chaste than my mother, and more pious in hand.
For us [I offer] these prayers;
but to the adversaries I pray that thou wouldst appear, 0 my sire, as an avenger, and that those who killed may through justice die in turn.
These things I interpose in my good prayer, uttering for them this evil im­ precation.
And be thou a sender of the blessings we implore to us in this upper world, with the favour of the gods, and of earth, and of triumphant justice.
And after such prayers as these I pour forth these drink-offerings;
and 'tis meet that you peal forth the dirge of the dead, should make it teem with shrieks.
[ELECTRA goes to the tomb.
CHORUS.
Shed ye the pattering death tear1 for the dead sovereign, now that drink-Offerings have been poured out upon this defence against both evil and good by way of averting2 unprayed-for pollution.
And do thou, 0 give ear, give ear, 0 master, from thy darkling spirit.
Woe!
woe!
woe !
woe!
alas !
what stout Scythian spearman is deliverer of the house, and Mars that in the conflict brandishes with his hands the curved darts, and wields hilted weapons in close combat ?EL. [returning to the Chorus.]
My father now has the earth-drunk libations';
and do ye share with me in a new discourse.
On.
Tell it:
but my heart is throbbing with terror.
EL. I see here a shorn ringlet4 of hair on the sepulchre.
CH. From what man or deep-bosomed maid?
EL.
This is an obvious matter for any one to form au opinion upon.
CH.
How then may I, aged, learn from thee, my junior?
EL.
There is no one who could have cut it off except myself.
On.
No-for they are enemies to whom it naturally belongs to mourn by offerings of hair.
EL.
And certainly this is of a very similar hue to behold.
CH.
To what tresses ?
for this I fain would know.
EL.
It is exceedingly like in appearance to my own.
On.
Is this then a clandestine offering from Orestes?
EL.
It does very much resemble his ringlets.
On.
And how did he venture to come hither?
EL.
He sent this shorn ringlet as a pleasing offering to his father.
CH.
No less is this which thou tellest me a subject for tears, if he is never to touch this land with his foot.
EL. O'er me too there hath come a heart's surge of bitter­ ness ;
and I was smitten as with a piercing shaft.
And from my eyes there are falling the unrestrained thirsting drops of a sad winter's flood, as I behold this lock:
for how can I suppose that any other of the citizens owns this hair ?
And of a surety she that murdered him did not cut it off—my mother I mean, who has a godless spirit towards her children by no means in accordance with her name.
Yet how can I openly yield assent to this conclusion, that this is an offering of honour from Orestes, of all mortals to me most dear?
But I am fawned upon by hope.
Alas!
would to heaven that it had an intelligent voice, like a messenger, that I might not be agitated by distracted thoughts1;
but it were clear for me either to spurn this lock of hair when clearly recognized, if indeed it had been severed from the head of a foe, or that, if it claim kin to me, it might be able to bewail with me an ornament to this tomb and an honour to my father2.
But we invoke the gods, who know in what tempests, like vessels, we are tossed to and fro;
and if it is our destiny to attain safety, a great stock might be pro­ duced from a tiny seed.
And in very truth here are tracks too, a second sign, like to feet, and bearing a resemblance to my own.
For there are also here two prints of footsteps, both of himself and of some fellow-traveller.
The heels and the impress of the tendons being measured, coincide exactly with my footsteps.
But pains (as of a woman in travail) and prostration of mind is upon me.
Pray thou, uttering to the gods prayers that shall bring their accomplishment, that what remains may turn out well.
EL.
But what have I now attained as respects the favour of the gods?
OR.
You have come to the sight of those whom for a long time you used to pray to see.
EL.
And on whom of mortals is it that thou knowest me to have called ?
OR.
I know that thou hast full oft had sad longings for Orestes.
EL.
And what, then, do I attain the object of my prayers?
OR.
I am he:
search not for any one more uear to thee than I am.
EL. But, stranger, art thou not weaving some trick around me?
OR.
Truly then I am framing schemes against myself.
EL.
But thou fain wouldst scoff at my calamities?
OR.
Ay, and at my own also, if indeed at thine.
EL. As being Orestes, am I then addressing thee with these words?
OR.
Nay, now, when thou seest me in person, thou hardly knowest me, but when thou didst see your brother's shorn ringlet of mourning hair which corresponded with thine own head, and wast tracing thy footsteps in the track of my feet, thou wart all of a flutter, and didst fancy thou sawest me.
Consider the ringlet of my hair, after placing it on the part whence I clipped it;
and behold this web, the work of thy hand, and the strokes of the shuttle, and on it the delineation of wild beasts2.
Be yourself3, and be not over-amazed in soul through joy, for I know that the dearest relatives are bitter foes to us twain.
EL. 0 best-beloved care of thy father's house, thou deplored hope of a preserving seed, trusting in thy prowess, thou shalt recover the house of thy father.
0 delightful eye that enjoyest four shares [in my affections]1:
and needful it is that I should both address thee as a father, and the endearment of a mother devolves on thee,—(but she is most justly detested)- and of a sister that was barbarously sacrificed:
but thou art my faithful brother, bringing dignity to me.
Only may both Strength and Justice, with the third, the greatest of all, Jupiter, favour me !OR. 0 Jupiter, Jupiter!
be thou a spectator of these things;
and look upon the orphan brood of an eagle sire, that perished in the folds and coils of a dread serpent.
Oil them bereft is hungry 1amine pressing, for [the broody is not of full age to bring their father's prey to the nest.
And so thou mayest behold both me and this maiden—I mean Electra—a progeny bereft of their father, both enduring the same banishment from their home.
And, wert thou to abandon to destruction these, the offspring of a father that did thee sacrifice and honoured thee greatly, whence wouldst thou have the honour of the solemn festival from a like hand?
Neither, wert thou to abandon to destruction the eagle's young, wouldst thou here­ after be able to send tokens well believed by mortals.
Nor will this royal stock, if entirely withered, do thine altars service on days when oxen are sacrificed.
Take care [of it], and raise from its low estate a mighty house, that now seems to have fallen very low.
CH. 0 children, saviours of your paternal hearth, keep silence, that none may hear you, my children, and, in pleasure for the tongue, report all to the rulers :
-whom may I, some time or other, see dead amid the pitchy smoke of the flame!
OR.
The oracle of Loxias, great in its might, will not fail me, bidding me pass through this peril, and loudly cheering me on, and muttering out tempestuous curses beneath my fevered breast, should I not pursue the murderers of my father, directing me, maddened like a bull, to slay them in their turn with a penalty not paid in money1;
and he declared that [if I failed to do so] I should make this atonement in my soul, enduring many comfortless ills.
For the soothing remedies for malignant evils [which arise] to mortals from the earth, these he declared should to us be maladies2—leprosies that assail the flesh with fierce fangs, and entirely eat away its original nature;
and that white hairs should sprout forth in this malady.
And he spoke of my seeing clearly, as I guide my brow in the dark, other assaults of the Furies, produced by the blood of my father.
For the darkling shaft of those beneath the earth, that comes from suppliants who have fallen by a kindred hand and phrenzy, and groundless terror by night, torments, harasses, and chases from the city the body that has been mangled by the brazen-forged scourge.
And of such [he declares] that it is the doom neither to have any share of the festal bowl, nor of the liquor used in libations, and that a father's unseen wrath excludes him from altars, and that no one will receive nor dwell with him3;
but that unhonoured and abhorred of all, he should at length die, horribly wasted away4, by a doom of utter destruction.
To oracles such as these must I not give credence?
Nay, if I did not give credence to them, the deed must be done;
for many cravings coincide in one-both the commands of the god, and my great sorrow for my father, and the lack of substance moreover presses me—that my fellow-citizens, most highly renowned of men, they that overthrew Troy with gallant spirit, may not thus live in subjection to two women:
-for womanish is his mind;
or if not, it shall full soon be known1.
CH.
But, 0 ye mighty destinies, vouchsafe ye, by the will of Jove, that it may end in the way which Justice takes.
"In return for a hostile speech be a hostile speech paid back”— cries Justice aloud as she exacts the debt,-" and in return for a murderous blow let him suffer a murderous blow."
DOER MUST SUFFER;
thus saith a thrice-antique saw.
OR.
Father, unhappy father, by saying or by doing what, could I, with a favouring breeze, waft from afar to thee, where thy couch [of death] holds thee, a light equal to darkness2?
But nevertheless3, a glorious dirge for the patriarchs of Atreus' line, at all events, is deemed a grateful offering.
On:
.
My child, the consuming jaws of fire quell not the spirit of the dead, but afterwards he shows his wrath.
But the deadjs bewailed with a funeral moan, and he that wronged him is discovered.
A righteous grief for fathers and for parents, stirred up on all sides, investigates the whole.
EL. Give ear now, 0 my father, in turn, to my griefs of many tears.
The lament of thy two children over thy tomb bewails thee.
And thy sepulchre hath received us who are alike suppliants and outcasts.
What of these things is well?
and what is without ills?
Is not ours an invincible calamity?
CH.
Yet, hereafter, out of this, God, if he be willing, may grant us sounds more jocund;
and, instead of wailings o'er the tomb, a hymn of triumph in the royal halls may usher our newly-arrived4 friend.
OR.
Oh!
would that beneath the walls of Ilion, smitten with the spear by some of the Lycians, thou hadst been slain, my father!
Having bequeathed renown to thy house, after establishing for the ways of thy children [through life] a con­ dition worthy of notice, thou wouldst have occupied a sepulchre with a lofty mound in a land beyond the sea—in a manner that thy family might endure.
CH. Dear to those dear to thee who there gloriously fell, a prince of august majesty, distinguished beneath the earth, and a minister to the mightiest rulers in the shades below:
foi thou wast a king so long as thou wast alive, among' those that fill their destined lot with [deeds of] hands, and the sceptre that wins the obedience of mortals2.
EL.
Nor [would I that you], having fallen beneath the walls of Troy, my father, along with the other3 host, victims of the war, should have been buried beside Scamander's stream4 :
but would that his slayers had thus been beaten down previously, so that one, unscathed by these horrors, might have learned their fatal catastrophe.
On.
These things of which thou speakest, my child, are more precious than gold, and surpassing e'en Hyperborean happiness, for thou art in anguish8.
But [enough], for the clangof this double scourge comes upon me:
the protectors of these [children] are already beneath the earth:
but the hands of the odious pair that rule are polluted;
on their children too it bath fallen heavier6.
EL.
This pierced right through my cars, like a dart?.
0 Jupiter, Jupiter, thou that sendest up Atè, the late avenger on the hardy hand of mortals that dares all deeds1;
neverthe­ less;
retribution shall come upon parents.
On.
Would that it were mine to chant a welcome to the bitter2 outcry of a man when he is smitten, and of a dying woman!
for why am I to conceal how unceasingly there hovers [before]my mind, and before my face there sits3 violent passion of heart, wrathful loathing?
OR.
And would that at length, some day or other, Jupiter, who makes us both to flourish4, would put to his hand, alas alas!
cleaving their heads.
May security befall this realm!
I ask for justice from the unrighteous.
And do ye give ear that are had in honour by those beneath the carth5.
CH.
But it is a law, that drops of gore shed upon the ground call for other bloodshed in addition, for murder cries aloud to Erinnys6, who brings on from those that perished before, another woe upon woe.
EL. Whither, whither have the princedoms of the dead [fled]?
Behold, ye potent curses of the departed, behold the relics of the Atreidæ in straits, and dishonoured in their dwellings.
Whither should one betake one's self, 0 Jupiter!
CH.
Again hath my heart throbbed while I listened to this lament of thine;
and sometimes I am in despondency, and my vitals are overcast with gloom at thy speech, as I listen to it;
and again in turn, having confidence in support, sorrow departs, so that things seem well to me1.
OR.
And what should we all chance to be2?
Is it possible to wheedle the wrongs which we endure from those that gave us birth3?
But some things cannot be soothed;
for, like a ravening wolf, my mind is from my mother implacable4.EL.
She struck a martial strain;
then, after the manner of a Cissian heroine5, with a shower of blows wandering many ways might you see the outstretchings of her hand, dealt without intermission, from above, from afar;
and with the stroke my buffeted, and all-wretched head resounds.
Woe's me!
woe's me!
wretched all-daring mother, with wretched obsequies thou hadst the heart to inter a monarch without the attendance of his subjects, a hero unbewailed, without mourn­ ings6.
OR.
Every word that thou speakest is to our shame.
Ah me!
surely then she shall expiate her degradation of my father, as far as the divinities are concerned, and as far as depends upon my hands;
then may I perish, after having bereaved her [of life!]EL.
Furthermore too-that thou mayest know thishe was mangled7, and as she dealt with him, thus she buries him, eager to consummate for him a doom that should be an intolerable burthen to thy life.
Thou hearest thy father's shameful sufferings.
OR.
Thou speakest of my father's doom.
EL. Ay, and I was thrust forth, dishonoured, nothing worth;
and barred out from the innermost apartment, like a too mischievous cur.
I gave vent to tear-drops more readily than laughter, blithe if I might conceal my tearful woe.
Listening to such things grave them within thy bosom, and make my tale pass through thine ears with the leisure step of thine understanding.
For of these matters some are thus, and others seek thou thyself eagerly to learn.
But it becomes thee to enter the lists with unflinching spirit.
OR.
To thee do I make my appeal, lend thine aid, 0 father, to thy friends.
EL.
And I lamented with tears well shed join in the cry.CH.
This1 entire company too echoes the prayer:
Oh corne into the light and give ear:
and be thou present against thy foes.
EL. 0 gods, give a righteous decision.
CH.
A shuddering creeps over me as I listen to your prayers.
That which is foredoomed abides from the olden time, and to those that pray for it, it may come.
Alas!
struggle of kindred.
and bloody discordant stroke of Atè!
Alas for the sad intolerable woes!
Alas for the sore hard to stanch!
There is in the house a styptic remedy3 for these things, .and that not from others from abroad, but from themselves, in that I pursue the quarrel of blood shedeling1;
this is the song of the powers beneath the earth.
But oh, ye immortal powers below, give ear to these orisons of ours, and graciously send to the children aid unto victory.
OR.
Father, thou that didst die in no king-like manner, vouchsafe to me entreating2, the mastery over thy house.
EL. I too, father, stand in the like need of thine aid, that I may escape after having brought a signal [doom] upon Ægisthus.
OR.
For thus should the banquets that are established among mortals be dedicated to thee:
but if not, at the funeral feasts3thou wiit be unhonoured by savoury burnt-offerings from the earth.
EL. I too, from my entire substance, will bring to thee my nuptial offerings from the paternal dwelling;
for beyond all things I will reverence this thy tomb.
OR. 0 earth, send up my father to overlook the conflict.
EL. 0 Proserpine, vouchsafe to us also victory of beauteous aspect.
OR.
Remember the bath in which thou wast bereaved of life, my father.
EL. Remember too how strangely they enclosed thee in the net4.
OR.
Thou wast ensnared in fetters not wrought of brass, my father.
EL. Ay, and in folds of vestments foully planned.
OR.
Art thou not roused by these reproaches, father ?EL.
Dost thou not then rear erect thy dearest head?
OR.
Either despatch justice, an ally to thy friends, or grant [foesj to receive in recompense like injuries, if indeed after having been mastered thou wishest to triumph in thy turn.
EL.
And give ear, my father, to this final ery of mine to thee.
Beholding thy young ones here sitting on thy sepul- chre, take pity upon thy female, and likewise on thy male offspring;
and do not utterly blot out this seed of the Polo­ pidæ.
For thus thou art not dead;
not even though thou didst die, for children are to the deceased reputation preserv­ ing;
and like corks they buoy up the net, upholding the twist of the flaxen cord from the deep.
Give ear!
'tis on thy behalf that laments such as these are poured forth, and thou thyself art saved by honouring this our petition.
CH1.
And in truth ye have lengthened out this your petition blamelessly, an honour to the tomb and to his unwept fate :
for the rest, since thou hast been aroused in spirit to achieve it, do it forthwith, trying thy chance.
OR.
It shall be so;
but it is not out of my way to inquire how it comes that she sent drink-offerings, in consequence of what it is that she pays too late attention to an irreparable wrong ?
To the dead too, unconscious of it, a sorry offering was sent.
I cannot guess the import of these gifts, but they are too small for the trespass.
For though one were to make every libation in atonement for a single murder, the labour would be in vain:
so runs the saying.
But if thou knowest this, tell it to me wishing [to hear it].
CH. I know it, my child, for I was by;
for having been agitated by dreams and restless terrors of the night, the god less woman sent these drink-offerings.
OR.
Did ye also hear the dream, so as to tell it correctly ?
Cii.
She fancied, as -he herself says, that she gave birth to a serpent.
OR.
And what is the end and issue of the tale ?
CH. thatthe new-born monster was lying3 in swad­ dling-clothes like an infant, in want of food4,and she in her dream gave it her breast.
OR.
And how was the dug wounded not by the abomi­ nation ?
On. fit did not wound her,] so as to draw clotted blood along with the milk.
OR.
This vision of a man come not in vain1.
CH.
And she, fluttering with fear, screamed in her sleep;
and many lamps that had been extinguished in darkness sprang into light through the palace on account of our mis­ tress.
And then she sends these funereal drink-offerings, hoping for a fitly-shred2 remedy for her sufferings.
OR.
But I make my prayer to this earth, and to the tomb of my father, that this dream may bring accomplishment to me.
And i'faith I interpret it so that it exactly tallies;
for if, after quitting the same place with me, the serpent was decked in my swaddling-clothes, and mouthed the breast that gave me nutriment, and mingled with clotted blood the loved milk, and she shrieked in dread at this mischance-it needs must be that she, as she reared a terrific portent, should die a violent death ;
and I, changed into a serpent, will slay her, as this dream of her's declares.
And I choose thee for my expounder of por­ tents as touching this matter.
On.
So be it:
but explain the rest of thy plan to thy friends, bidding some to do something, and others not to act.
OR.
The talc is simple:
I recommend my sister here tc go within and to conceal these plans agreed upon [with her];
that after slaying an august monarch, they too may be entrapped by guile, dying in the very same toils, even as Loxias too predicted, king Apollo, a prophet of unfailing truth heretofore.
For like to a stranger, having complete equip­ ment, I will come with my friend Pvlades here to the gates of the court-yard, as a guest and friend of the family.
And we both will utter the Parnassian dialect, imitating the sound of aPhecian tongue.
And suppose that no one of the porters will admit us with gladsome mind, (since the house is possessed with ills,) we will remain thus, so that any one walking past the house may make a guess, and say this:
“Why thus with [closed] gates exclude ye the suppliant?
if Ægisthus is at home and aware of his presence?"
If then I pass the threshold of the gates of the court-vard.
and shall discover him upon my father's throne, or if he come then and speak to me to my face and cast his eyes upon me, know cer­ tainly that before he says, " What countrymen is the stranger?"
I will stretch him a corpse, coming round him1 with nimble swordsmanship.
And Erinnys. that Lath not been stinted of slaughter, shall quaff blood undiluted, a third draught.
Now then, do thou watch well what is within the house, that these things may fall out well-combined.
But to you I re­ commend to keep a silent tongue, both to keep silence where it is needful, and to speak what is suited to the moment.
For the rest I appeal to this my [friend] to come hither and overlook these matters;
to him that has helped:
!
me to success in this conflict of the wielded sword.
CH. Full many3 a dread and grievous horror does the earth nurture, and the arms of the deep teem with monsters hostile to mortals!
and there spring forth in mid-air lights4 hung aloft.
Both the creatures that fly and those that crawl, and the gusty rage of hurricanes, one might be able to describe.
But who can tell the mighty daring spirit of man, and of women hardened in their souls, and their loves that venture all, comates with the woes of mortals?
Un-lovely love, lord­ in- it in woman's heart, overcomes the conjugal societies of brutes and of men.
Let whosoever is not flighty in his thoughts know this, when he hath learned what a kindling device the wretched daughter of Thestius, who worked the destruction of her son, sought out, when she committed to the flames the glowing brand that was his coeval, from the time when he uttered his first cry on coming from the womb, and commensurate through his life unto the day foredoomed by Fate.
Another is there in legends whom we are bound to abhor, the murderess Scylla, who at the focman's instigatioi destroyed a man [she should have] loved, having been seduced by Cretan necklaces of wrought gold, the gifts of Minos, what time she, shameless, robbed Nisus of his undying ringlet as he was breathing unsuspectingly in sleep;
but Mercury1 overtakes her.
And since I have made mention of savage horrors, though unseasonably2, [one may also mention] the odious match, execrated by the house, and plots laid by a woman's mind against an armed warrior, against a warrior for his majesty bitter to his enemies;
and I honour the hearth of a household that knows not audacity, and in women an undaring spirit.
Of horrors, indeed, that of Lemnos holds the first place in story;
and it is deplored in every clime as an abomination, and a man is wont to compare what is dreadful to Lemnian sufferings3.
And by reason of heaven-detested guilt the race of mortals perishes in infamy;
for no one reveres that which is offensive to the gods.
Which of these hideous facts do I unreasonably reckon up?
But the sword, sharp and bitter, inflicts a wound right through the lungs, driven by the hand of Justice.
For the lawless conduct of him4 that bath lawlessly trespassed against every awful attribute of Jupiter, is not trampled under foot on the ground.
But the base of Justice is planted firm;
and Fate, that forges the sword, pre­ pares it for the deed, and brings into the house a new offering of ancient murders, and time-honoured5 Erinnys avenges the stain.
FORESTES re-enters, and goes up to the gates of the palace.
ORESTES.
Boy, boy1!
hear the knocking at the gates of the court-yard.
Who is within there in the house?
boy, boy, I say again, a third time I call for some one to come out of the house, if Ægisthus forsooth be given to hospitality2.
DOMESTIC.
Well, well—I hear you.
What countryman is the stranger?
whence comes he3?
OR.
Bear word to the masters of the mansion, unto whom I am come and am bringing news;
and be quick, since also night's dusky car is speeding on, and 'tis time for wayfarers to let go their anchor in houses that welcome all strangers.
Let there come forth some lady-mistress of the house, that hath power:
but it were more decorous that a man should [come to us], for that bashfulness does not in the course of conversation make words obscure:
man is wont to speak with confidence to man, and expresses his thoughts with certainty.
Guests,say whatsoever is necessary;
for there are at hand things such as beseem this dwelling of ours, both warm baths4, and the couch that soothes fatigues, and the presence of benignant eyes.
But if ye are bound to transact any other business that requires somewhat of consultation, this is the concern of men, to whom we will communicate it.
OR.
I am a stranger of Daulis, come from the Phocians;
and as I was journeying to Argos, self freighted with my own baggage, just as I set forth hither on foot, a stranger who met me said to me a stranger, after having particularly inquired and clearly explained to me my road, Strophius the Phocian, -for I ascertain his name in course of conversation:
—“Since on other business, stranger, thou art going to Argos, tell his parents that Orestes is dead, strictly remembering it, let it by no means be forgotten;
whether the determination of his friends shall prevail to eonvey him away, or whether to bury him in the land of his sojourn, altogether estranged for ever, bring back with thee their commands on this subject;
for now the sides of a brazen urn conceal the ashes of the man who hath been duly bewailed."
Thus much I tell thee as I heard it.
And whether I am speaking to the heads of the family and to his relations I know not, but it is proper that his parents know it.
EL. Woe's me!
how1 are we utterly ruined.
0 in­ superable curse of this family, how dost thou level at many things that are well placed out of thy way, overcoming them with thy bow, that carries true to the mark even from afar.
Thou strippest me thoroughly wretched of my friends.
And now Orestes,—for he used to be lucky in his throws, removing his foot from out the slough of destruction,-but now—the hope which was to be medicinal against the goodly revelry in this house, he writes down as present2.OR.
I could indeed have wished to have become known, and to have been welcomed as a guest by hosts thus opulent through the means of gladsome tidings;
for what more kindly feeling is there than that which is entertained by a guest to­ wards hosts?
But to my mind it was an act of impiety not to fulfil such an obligation as this to friends, having pledged ray word, and been hospitably welcomed.
CLYT.
Be sure thou shalt not meet with unworthy treat­ ment, and not the less shouldest thou be friendly to the house­ hold;
For some one else would have come all the same to bring us these tidings.
But it is the fit time for strangers that spend the whole day in long travel, to obtain the things that are suitable under their circumstances.
Conduct him into the hospitable male apartments of the palace, and these his attendants and fellow-travellers, and there let them enjoy treatment such as beseems the house.
And I bid thee do this as liable to be called to account.
And we will both commu­ nicate these things to the heads of the family, and not lacking friends, will deliberate concerning this misfortune.
[CLYTÆMNESTRA.
enters the palace.
CHORUS.
Well, dear handmaidens of the house, when indeed shall we put forth the strength of our mouths on account of Orestes?
0 revered earth, and revered pile of the mound, which now dost press upon the remains of the monarch that led the fleet, now give ear, now lend thine aid;
for now is it high time for wily plausibility and the nether Mercury to come together, and to guide the mysterious man on his way in conflicts of the destructive sword.
The stranger seems to be working mischief.
But I see the nurse of Orestes coming hither, in tears.
On what errand Cilissa, art thou treading the outlet1 of the palace?
and no hireling sorrow is it that accompanies thee on thy way.
My mistress bade me call Ægisthus with all speed for the strangers2, that having come, man may learn more clearly from man the tidings just reported.
Before the domestics, indeed, she suppressed her laughter within her scowling eyes, conceal­ ing it over deeds that have been done well for her, but for this house all unhappily, in consequence of the tale which the strangers clearly reported.
Verily he, when he hears it, will rejoice in his mind, when he shall have learned the news.
Alas, wretch that I am!
how did the ancient blended sorrows, hard to be endured, that happened to this mansion of Atreus, afflict with anguish my heart within my bosom!
But never yet did I undergo any suffering such as this.
For the rest of my calamities I bore through with patience;
but my dear Orestes, the care of my soul, whom I reared up, having received him from the moment of his birth3 and from his arousing cries, disturbing me by night many fruitless toils have been endured by me in vain.
For [the infant] that has no sense one must needs rear just as if it were an animal, for how can it be otherwise?
according to his humour;
for a child while yet in swaddling-clothes speaks not, whether hunger, or thirst, or a call of nature beset him;
and the belly of an infant works its own relief.
I, fore-warned of these things, but in many cases deceived, I ween, was a washer of the baby's wrappings;
the fuller and the nurse had one and the same office1.
And I having this twofold manual occupation, I received Orestes from his father2.
But now I wretched hear of his having died.
And I am going to a man that bath done foul wrong to this house;
and willingly will he hear these tidings.
CH. With what equipment does she then bid him come?
NUR.
With what equipment?
repeat your question, that I may understand it more clearly.
CH. [I mean] whether with guards, or even unattended?
NUR.
She bids him bring his spear-bearing followers.
CH.
Prithee do not thou bear this message to our detested master3;
but bid him come alone with rejoicing mind, with the best speed he may, that he may hear without apprehension;
for crooked4 tidings are set straight by the bearer.
NUR What!
art thou gladdened by the news that has now been brought?
CH.
No;
but [I shall be glad] if Jupiter at some future time shall work a change in our ills.
NUR.
And how?
Orestes, the hope of the house, hath perished.
On.
Not yet;
even a dull diviner might understand this.
NUR.
What sayest thou?
knowest thou aught different from what hath been told us?
CH. Go, tell thy message, execute thine orders.
The gods take care of those things about which they interest them­ selves.
NUR.
Well, I will go, and in this matter will yield me to thy bidding.
And may the issue be the best it can by the gift of heaven.
[Exit the NuRSE.Cil. 0 Jupiter!
sire of the Olympian gods, grant to me now beseeching thee that my fortunes may turn out successfully, in a manner that may be beheld by the wise well seeking2.
In integrity:
!
have I uttered every word.
0 Jupiter !
do protect them.
Ah ! ah!
and set thou [him] before his foes within the house, since, if thou exaltest him to glory, thou shalt, if thou pleasest, receive in return a double and threefold recompense.
Bethink thee too of a beloved hero's orphan youngling yoked
In harness of sufferings, and prescribe thou a limit to his race.
Who4 might see this striding of completed paces across the plain keeping due time?
Ye too, that haunt the alcove that exults in opulence, give ear, propitious gods.
Come, make atonement for the bloodshed of those that were done to death in the olden time by fresh vengeance.
No more let ancient murder spawn in the halls.
0 thou that tenantest the vast chasm, graciously grant that the hero's home may at the same time witness this righteous execution6, and that he may look forth fearlessly and brightly with friendly eyes from out the veil of gloom.
May Maia's most propitious6 son also, willing him an auspicious issue, rightfully take up the cause.
Many other mysterious things too will he develope if he be willing ;
and uttering obscure language, both by night he brings dark­ ness before the eyes, and in the daytime he is nought clearer.
And then at length will we pour forth' a loud song to celebrate the deliverance of the palace ;
such as may suit a woman's tongue, auspiciously raised, and withal the lyre-struck strain of mourners:
for the city this is well;
my gain too, mine is enchanced, and evil withdraws from my friends.
But do thou boldly, when thy share of the deed shall have come, after shouting thy father's name over a deed done for thy father's sake, in answer to her shrieking, “ My son !" consummate a vengeance not wholly blameless2.
Maintaining too within thy bosom the spirit of Perseus, in the cause of those dear to thee both above and below the earth, working out bitter wrath rather than to affection3, accomplishing a murderous destruc­ tion on those within, cutting off utterly the author of murder.
I have come not unbidden, but summoned by a messenger ;
and I understand that some strangers who have arrived tell us news by no means welcome, to wit, the death of Orestes.
And the imputation of this upon the house would be a blood- dripping burthen upon one still ulcerated and irritated by the former murder4.
How am I to deem these tidings true and clear?
or can it be that alarming rumours in the minds of women are flitting in mid-air, such as die away without effect ?
What of these things shouldst thou say, so as to prove it to my mind ?
On.
We heard it indeed, but go thou within and question the strangers ;
the authority of messengers is no way so good as for a man himself to make enquiry about the tidings which they bring5.
ÆGIS.
I wish to see and question farther the messenger, whether he himself was present close at hand where he died, or whether he is telling what he has learned from obscure re­ port.
He certainly will not be able to delude a discerning mind.
[Exit ÆGISTHUS.
On.
J upiter !
Jupiter!
what am I to say ?
whence shall I commence thus praying and importunatingi ?
How, speaking from good feeling, shall I obtain an equivalent boon ?
For now either the gore-stained attempts of the man-slaying axes are on the point of working the destruction of the family of Agamemnon throughout all time, or he, kindling fire and light for liberty, and the authorities that give laws to the state, shall enjoy the great weal of his fathers.
Upon such a eon­ flict as this is god-like Orestes, a solitary single-handed champion, on the point of entering against two.
And may it be for victory!.
Eois. (from, within the palace).
—Ah !
what, ho !
CH.
Ah! ah !
again !
How stands the matter ?
how are things accomplished in the house ?
Stand we aloof from the eomsummation of the business, that we may seem to be no way implicated in these horrors ;
for the issue of the conflict hath assuredly been settled.
Woe's me!
ay every woe's me, for my slain lord!
yet once more woe's me !
in a third exclamation.
Ægisthus is no more :
but open as quickly as ye may, and unclose, by [re­ moving] the bars, the doors of the women's apartments ;
and need there surely is of a vigorous arm;
but not to succour the slain ;
what need of that ?
What, hoa !
I am shouting to the deaf, and calling in vain to those that are madly sleeping.
Where is Clytæmnestra ?
what is she doing ?
It seems now that her neck is soon to fall on the edge of the steel, she being justly smitten2.
CLYT. (coming forward).
—What is the matter?
what meant the outcry thou art raising in the house ?
DOM.
I tell thee that the dead are slaying the living.
CLYT.
Ah me!
I apprehend thy meaning from thy dark expressions.
By treachery shall we perish exactly as we slew.
Some one hand me a deathly axe with all speed.
Let us see whether we are to be victors or vanquished;
for unto that crisis of this evil am I come.
ORES. (bursting in.)
—Thee too am I seeking-this wretch here has enough.
CLYT.
Ah me !
thou art dead, dearest Ægisthus.
ORES.
Lovest thou the man ?
then shalt thou lie in the same tomb, and thou shalt never desert him in death.
CLYT.
Hold thee, my son!
and revere this breast on which thou full often slumbering wast wont at the same time to suck with thy gums the well-nourishing milk.
ORES.
Pylades, how am I to act?
is reverence to restrain me from slaying my mother ?
PYL.
Where, then, are the oracles of Apollo uttered at Pytho, and the faithful oaths well plighted ?
Deem all thine enemies rather than the gods1.
ORES.
I decide that thou prevailest, and admonisbest me well:
(turning to his mother,) follow me.
I wish to slay thee close beside his corpse here ;
for when he was alive too, thou didst use to deem him better than my father.
Go sleep with him in death, since thou dost love this man, and him whom thou wast bound to love thou loathest.
CLYT.
I reared thee, and with thee I would spend my age.
ORES.
What!
having murdered my sire, shalt thou dwell with me ?
CLYT.
Destiny, my child, was an accessory to these things.
ORES.
Ay, and so Destiny provides the doom that is now before thee.
ORES.
No ;
for after giving me birth thou didst cast me out into misery.
CLYT.
Surely I did not cast thee out [when I sent thee] to the house of a friend.
OR.
In two ways was I sold, son though I was of a free­ father.
CLYT.
Where then is the price which I received for barter­ in- thee away ?
OR.
I am ashamed to reproach thee in plain terms with this deed of thine.
CLYT.
Nay, only tell equally the follies of thy father.
OR.
Reproach not blin that bore the t(.il, thou that didst sit within the house.
CLYT.
'Tis a sorrow to women to be debarred from a hus­ band, my child.
OR.
Yet sure it is the husband's toiling that supports them as they sit within.
CLYT.
It seems, then, that thou wilt slay thy mother, my child.
OR.
'Tis thou wilt work thine own destruction, Dot I.CLYT.
Look to it, beware of the wrathful furies of a mother.
OR.
But how am I to escape those of my father if I neglect this?
CLYT.
I, a living woman, seem to be vainly making my moan to a sepulchre.
Or:
..
Ay, for the fate of my father wafts1 down upon thee the doom that now awaits thee.
CLYT.
Ah me!
this is the serpent that I bore and nurtured.
In truth the panic occasioned by my dreams has been indeed prophetic.
OR.
Thou didst in truth slay one whom it became thee not, so suffer what becomes thee not.
[ORESTES forces his mother into the palace.
CH.
Let us then bewail the twofold calamity even of this wretched pair.
And since the hapless Orestes hath attained the consummation of many slaughters, this notwithstanding we prefer, that the eye of the house has not fallen in utter destruction.
There hath come after a time vengeance for the chil­ dren of Priam, heavy-avenging retribution;
and there hath come into the dwelling of Agamemnon, a twofold lion, a twofold Mars.
The exile of whom Apollo spake hath been successful2 in every respect, having been rightly excited by the counsels of heaven.
Celebrate ye with a loud shout the escape1 of our master's house from evils, and from the dilapi­ dation of its treasures by the defiling pair, a mournful fate.
There hath come to one whose care is lurking warfare, Retribution of wily soul.
The daughter of Jove too hath in very truth lent a hand to the battle,-and correctly do we mortals style her Justice,-breathing deadly wrath against her foes:
whom Apollo, the god of Parnassus, that haunts the mighty cavern of the earth, upon the summit, hath led, without guile he comes upon one guileful, halting in delay.
The divinity is in a manner prevented from aiding the wicked.
Meet it is that we revere the power of the celestials.
We are permitted to behold the light, and the great fetter2 of the mansion hath been taken off.
Arise ye now, however, ye palaces!
for too long a period did ye lie ever grovelling on the earth.
Soon too will all-completing Time pass the vesti­ bule of the palace, when he shall have driven from the hearth every abomination by lustral observances that expel calamities3, and it shall be permitted us mourners to see and hear every thing in a lucky posture..
The outcasts from the house shall be restored.
We are permitted to behold the light.
OR.
Behold ye the two sovereigns of the realm and the pillagers of this mansion that murdered my father.
Proud were they, when sitting on their thrones, and now too [are they] loving, as we may guess from what has befallen them, and the oath remains to their pledges [unbroken].
They con­ spired indeed [to work] the death of my unhappy father, and to die together;
and this result is according to the oath.
Fur- thermore behold ye1,—ye that are hearers of these ills, the contrivance, the shackles of my unhappy father, both the fet­ ters for his hands and the yoke for his feet!
Stretch it out, and standing round in a circle display the robe that enshrouded the hero, in order that the father may see-not mine, but he that beholdeth all these things, the Sun—the unhallowed doings of my mother;
that so he may be present to me in my trial some future time, as an evidence, that with justice I pro­ secuted this doom;
of my mother I mean, for I am not speak­ ing of that of Ægisthus, for he has undergone the sentence of an adulterer, as the law prescribes.
But she who plotted this detestable deed against a husband, from whom she had been wont to bear the burthen of children beneath her zone-a burthen once dear, but now, as is plain, an hostile ill—what thinkest thou?
assuredly she was a conger, or a viper2, that could canker by a touch one who had not suffered from her bite, by reason of her daring and her unrighteous spirit;
what shall I call it, and succeed in giving it a correct name?
a snare for a wild beast, or a canopy of a bath that enshrouded the feet of the dead ?
nay rather, thou mightest call it a net or toils, and a robe for snaring the feet.
A thing like this a robber might have in his possession;
one that deceives stran­ gers, that leads a life of plunder, and cutting off many by this device, he might nurse many a hot deed in his mind.
Be never woman like this an inmate in my house:
sooner may I be doomed by the gods to die childless.
On.
Alas!
alas for the sad deeds!
by a hateful death wast thou despatched, and for the survivor also suffering blame.
On.
Did he or did he not do it?
but this vest bears witness to me that the sword of Ægisthus stained it.
The stain of the gore too coincides with the time [of the deed,] damaging the various hues of the embroidery.
Now I praise him3, now upon the spot I bemoan him;
and addressing his vestment, that wrought my father's fall, I grieve for the offences and the suffering, and the entire family, having the unenviable pollutions of this victory which I have achieved.
CH.
No one of human kind shall spend unscathed a life free from ill throughout its whole length.
Alas!
alas! of troubles one is this very instant upon us, and another will come.
OR.
But, that you may learn, I of a truth know to what issue it will come1:
as though with horses of a charioteer I am wandering wide of the course;
for thoughts hard to be con­ trolled are hurrying me away overcome by them.
And at my heart fear is ready to sing or dance in phrensy.
But while I am still in my senses, I make declaration to my friends, and assert that with justice I slew my mother, an abomination, murdering my father, and detested of the gods.
And as for my provocatives to this daring, I prize most highly Loxias, the prophet of Pytho, who announced to me by oracle, that if I did this I should be beyond the reach of evil censure;
but if I had neglected it, I will not tell the penalty;
for no one will arrive at the agonies by conjecture.
And now behold me, how arrayed with this branch and chaplet I will draw nigh unto the central shrine, the spot trodden by2 Loxias, and the blaze of fire that bath been called imperish­ able, fleeing from this kindred blood:
nay Loxias charged me not to betake myself to any other shrine.
And I bid all the Argives bear witness to me, how that after a lapse of time these evils were dealt out by me:
but I a vagabond, estranged from this land, living and dying having left this fame.
CH.
But since thou hast done well, neither yoke thy month to evil omened words, nor with thy tongue bode horrors, after having given liberty to the whole state of the Argives, success­ fully lopping the heads of two serpents.
OR.
Ah!
ah!
ye handmaids, here they are in the guise of Gorgons, in sable vestments, and entwined with densely woven snakes.
I can stay no longer.
CH.
What fancies disturb thee, thou dearest of men to thy father ?
command thyself, be not seared after achieving a sig­ nal victory.
OR.
They are not fancies of these agonies that are upon me;
for here are plainly the angry hell-hounds of my mother.
CH. Aye, for the fresh blood is still upon thine hands, hence is it that perturbation falls upon thy mind.
OR.
Sovereign Apollo!
now they are swarming;
and from their eyes they still loathly gore.
CH.
Within there is purification for thee ;
but if thou touch­ est Loxias, he will set thee free from these sufferings.
OR.
Ye indeed see not these, but I do see them1;
and I am driven away, and can stay no longer.
[Exit ORESTES.CH.
But mayest thou be happy, and may the deity, graci­ ously regarding thee, protect thee for a better hap.
This third tempest arising out of the family, after having blown
In its turn in the royal halls, like as a family wind2 hath come to an end.
First of all there were the child-devouring wretched troubles of Thyestes.
Next came a hero's kingly sufferings, and stabbed in a bath the warrior chieftain of the Greeks perished.
Now too once more, third in order, there bath come, we know not whence, a saviour, or should I call it doom.
Where then is the violence of calamity, when lulled, to find an end;
or where is it to reach a termination?
ORESTES comes to Delphi, pursued by the Erinnys of his mothe- Clytæmnestra.
He is assured of Apollo's protection, and the scene changes to Athens, where he undergoes his trial before the Areopagus, now instituted by Minerva.
On his acquittal, the Erinnys at first threaten Athens with their wrath;
but, on Minerva assuring them that they shall ever be held in honour, they promise to confer all possible blessings upon the Athenians.
PYTHIAN PRIESTESS.ORESTES.CHORUS OF FURIES.
PRIESTESS.
First indeed with these prayers I honour Earth the first-prophetess of the Deities:
and after her' Themis, who then next sat on this, her mother's, oracular seat, as a certain legend runs.
But in the third turn, [Themis] being willing, and not in despite of any one, Titanian Phœbe, another child of Earth took the seat, and she gives it to Phœbus as a birth gift.
And he has his name derived from Phœbe.
But having left the lake and the Delian rock, having landed on the ship-receiving shores of Pallas, he came into this land and to the seats of Parnassus.
And the road-making, sons of Vulcan2 attend on3, and greatly worship him, rendering the rough earth smooth.
But the people honour exceedingly him having come, and Delphus who sways the helm1 of this land.
And Jove having made him inspired in mind with the art, seats him here the fourth seer on the throne ;
and Loxias2 is the prophet of his father Jove.
To these deities I prelude my address with prayers.
And Pronæan Pallas is celebrated in story.
And I venerate the nymphs, where is the Corieian hollow grot, bird-loved, the haunt of Deities.
Bromius too possesses the realm, nor am I forgetful of it, from the time that the god led on his Bacchants, having plotted death for Pentheus like a hare ;
and invoking the fountains of Plistus, and the might of Neptune, and perfect highest Jove.
I then sit down a prophetess on the throne;
and now may the gods grant that I obtain by far the best of former entrances, and if any from the Greeks are present, let them advance having obtained their turn by lot, as is the custom:
for I prophesy as the god may direct.
(She enters the temple, and suddenly returns.)
Certainly things dreadful to tell, and dreadful to behold with eyes have sent me back from the abodes of Loxias, so that I neither have strength, nor can uplift my steps :
but I run with my hands, not by swiftness of legs ;
for an affrighted old woman is nothing, like a child [in strength].
I creep, indeed, towards the shrine of many garlands3, and I behold at the marble navel stone4 a man under the eurse5 of god, sitting as a suppliant, with his hands dripping with blood, and hold­ ing a newly-drawn1 sword, and a high-grown branch of olive, wreathed decorously with much2 wool, with a white fleeee:
for so I will clearly declare.
But before this man a wondrous troop of women sleeps seated in the seats;
by no means women, but Gorgons I call them;
nor again will I liken them to Gorgon forms3, [for] I have seen once on a time [the Harpies] painted, carrying off the food of Phineus;
but these are wingless to behold, and black, abominable in kind.
And.
they snore with breathings not to be approached, and from their eyes they distil hateful violenee4.
And their dress is fit to wear neither at the images of gods, nor within the dwellings of men.
I have not beheld the tribe of this sisterhood ;
nor [do I know] what land can boast of having nourished this race with impunity, so as not to groan on account of its troubles.
Let what ensues now be a care to the ruler of these abodes mighty Loxias himself:
but he is healing-seer and diviner and purifier of abodes5 to others.
[The interior of the temple, with the tripod and omphalus, is disclosed, and ORESTES is dis­ covered sitting on the omphalus, the chorus of FURIES sleeping on seats around him.
APOLLO standing by his side, and HERMES in the background1.]
APOLLO.
By no means will I forsake you:
but till the end standing near you as a guardian, even though far off, to your enemies I will not be gentle.
And now you behold these mad ones caught;
but the abhorred virgins, aged chil­ dren have fallen in sleepy whom neither one of the gods, nor man, nor beast, at any time embraces;
but for the sake of evils they were born ;
since they inhabit evil darkness, and Tartarus beneath the earth, things hated by men and Olym­ pian gods.
But nevertheless fly, nor be softened in spirit;
for they will pursue with impunity you even through the long continent as you proceed3 along the land trod in your wander­ ings, and over the deep, and the sea-girt cities.
And be not wcared, driven herd-like1 through this toil:
but coming to the city of Pallas sit down having taken in your arms5 the ancient image ;
and there, having judges of these things and soothing words, we will find means, so as completely to deliver you from these toils:
for truly I persuaded you to slay your mother.
ORESTES.
King Apollo thou knowest indeed to be just, and since thou knowest this, learn also not to be unmindful, but your power is an assurance that you will do things well.
AP.
Remember, let not fear overcome you in mind.
And do you, my brother, of a common father's blood, Mercury, guard him ;
and, being very rightly named, be a conductor, taking care of this my suppliant.
Jove reveres excessively6 this [thine] office, coming to mortals with well-conducting:
fortune.
[Exit ORESTES, conducted by HERMES.
The Ghost of GLYTÆMNESTRA ascends1.
]GHOST OF CLYTÆMNESTRA.
Sleep on, will ye2?
and what need is there of sleepers ?
But I thus dishonoured by you among the other dead, because I was a slayer, reproach among the dead ceases not:
and in disgrace I wander, and I declare to you that I have the greatest reproach from those.
But having suffered thus dreadful things from those most dear, none of the deities is enraged on account of me, slaughtered by matricidal hands.
Behold these blows on thee, my hearty for the slumbering mind is keen in its eyes4, but during day the fate of medals cannot foresee5 futurity.
Full oftentimes have ye tasted of my offerings6, both wineless libations, tem­ perate soothing gifts, and I have offered at the hearth of fire nightly solemn feasts at an hour common to none of the gods.
And all these things I behold trampled under the heel.
But lie is gone having escaped like a fawn, and moreover lightly has he rushed from the midst of the toils, having greatly laughed at you.
Hear what I have said in behalf of this my soul, 0 goddesses beneath the earth:
for I Clytæmnestra, a dream7 now call upon you.
Snore on, but the man is gone flying afar:
for the gods of supplication are friendly to my relatives, not to me8.
Soundly you slumber, and pity not my suffering;
but Orestes murderer of me his mother is gone.
Do you cry oh?
do you slumber?
will you not quickly arise?
What thing has been done by you except to work evils ?
Sleep and toil powerful conspirers have wasted the strength of the fell dragon.
CLYT.
In dreams you pursue the beast, and moan like a do- that never leaves off the care of toil.
What are you doing ?
arise, let not toil overcome you, nor be ignorant of your loss, enfeebled by sleep.
Grieve your heart by my just reproaches :
for to the wise [such reproaches] are like stings.
But wafting on him your bloody breath, wasting him with a fire of the entrails, follow, consume him by a second pursuit.
CH.
Do you rouse, and rouse her, but I [rouse] you.
Dost sleep ?
arise, and having spurned off sleep, let us see if any of this prelude is vain.
Ah ! ah! —————We have suf­ fered friends, (certainly now I have suffered much and in vain) we have suffered affliction dire, 0 gods, intolerable ill.
The beast has fallen from out the toils, and is gone.
Over­ come by sleep I have lost my prey.
0 son of Jove, thou art thievish, and thou a young god hast ridden down aged deities, reverencing [this] suppliant, an impious man and bitter to his parents, and, god though you be, you have stolen away the matricide.
Which of these things will one say is just ?
But to me reproach coming from dreams has struck me, like a charioteer, with a middle-seizing goad.
At my heart, at my liver there is present a grievous pain from a scourger, an hostile executioner, so that I have a very griev­ ous chill.
Such things do the younger gods, exercising might in all things beyond right.
One may behold2 earth's navel stone having taken on itself a blood-dropping clot about foot and head, se as to have a terrible defilemeut of bloodshed.
But being a prophet, thou hast defiled with domestic pollution thy shrine, self-invited, self-called, contrary to the law of gods honouring mortal things3, and having destroyed the ancient fates;
and severe to me4, he shall yet not deliver him (Orestes,) and having fled beneath the earth, never shall he be set free.
But being guilty, he shall find another avenging deity on his!
head.
Ap.
Out, I bid you depart with speed from these abodes ;
begone from the prophetic shrines, lest even having received the winged swift snake2, hurled from the golden string, you seud forth through pain the black foam [sucked] from men.
vomiting the clots of gore which you have drawn.
By no means is it fitting to approach these abodes, but where there are head-cutting, eye-digging3 revenges and slaughters.
and the vigour of boys is injured, and destruction of the seed, and maiming, and stoning, [and where] those impaled by the spine groan with much wailing.
Hear, you, abhorred by the gods, of what a feast you have the delight ?
but the whole fashion of your form leads to this.
It is fit that such should inhabit the cave of the blood-sucking lion, not to tarry4 in these oracular seats, an abomination to the neighbours.
Be­ gone, you who feed without a keeper ;
but none of the gods has regard for such an herd.
CH. Royal Apollo, hear our reply in turn.
You yourself are not a sharer in these things, but have done them alto­ gether, being the entire cause.
AP.
How now ?
thus far extend your speech5.
CH.
You enjoined by oracles, so that the stranger should slav his mother.
AP.
I enjoined by oracles that he should inflict vengeance on account of his father :
what then ?
On.
And next you promised [to be] an advocate6 of new bloodshed.
Ap.
And I bade him betake himself to these abodes.
CH.
And you revile forsooth these [his] attendants.
Ap.
For it is not proper that they should come to these abodes.
On.
But this is commanded to us.
Ap.
What honour is this?
boast of a glorious office.
CH.
We drive the murderers of their mother from their homes.
AP.
But what [of the slayer] of a woman who has deprived her husband of life ?
On.
The blood of kindred should not be shed by kindred.
AP.
Certainly, the nuptial troth, pledged under connubial Juno and Jove, would be altogether without honour, and would avail nothing.
But Venus is cast away, dishonoured, by these words, whenee arise to mortals the dearest joys.
For the bed is appointed by fate to man and woman, and is greater1 than an oath, when guarded with justice.
If, therefore, you are gentle to those who slay each other, so that it comes to pass2 that lou do not even regard them with anger;
I say that you unjustly drive Orestes into exile:
for I know that you are exceedingly wroth at the one party, but manifestly treating the other more quietly.
But the goddess Pallas shall regard the justice of these things.
On.
That man never, in any respect, will I abandon.
AP.
Do you then pursue, and take to yourself more toil.
CH.
Do not you detract from my honours by your words.
AP.
I would not receive your honours, so as to possess them.
CH. For, altogether you are called great at the throne of Jove.
But I (for a mother's blood brings on punishment) will pursue this man, a huntress Fury.
AP.
But I will aid, and deliver the suppliant:
for dreadful among mortals and among gods, is the wrath of a suppliant, if willingly I should forsake him.
OR.3 Queen Minerva, by the commands of Apollo I am come, but do thou receive propitiously accused of crime, not one now stained with guilt nor impure in hand, but now blunted1, worn away before this time, in others' abodes and paths of mortals.
Passing over sea and land alike, observing the oracular injunctions of Loxias, I approach thine abode and image, goddess.
Here, keeping my station, will I await the event of justice (or, judgment).
CH. llo!
this is the clear sign of the man, but follow the counsels of the voiceless informer.
For as a dog chases the wounded hind, we trace out him by bloody drops2.
But with many deadly toils my bowels pant;
for every place of earth has been traversed, and over the sea by wingless flight have I come, pursuing, no way inferior to a ship.
And now he is crouching somewhere here:
the smell of human blood delights me.
Look, look again by all means;
observe all things;
lest the matricide unpunished escape your notice, having gone in flight.
He here again, having protection, twined around the image of the immortal goddess, wishes to undergo trial for his deed3.
But this may not be;
his mother's blood on the ground, cannot be recalled, alas!
the life's blood, poured or;
the plain, is gone.
But you needs must suffer punishment in your turn, so that I suck from you alive the red gore from your limbs ;
and may I bear from you the taste of a draught dire to quaff;
and having wasted you away I will lead you alive below, that1 you may suffer a return for the matricidal woe.
But you shall behold2, if any other too of mortals has sinned, acting impiously either towards a god, or any guest.
or dear parents, each having things worthy of justice.
For mighty Pluto is the judge of mortals below the earth, and he looks upon all things with recording mind.
OR.
I, taught in evils, know many ablutions;
and to speak, when it is proper, and to be silent in like manner:
but in this thing I was enjoined to speak by a wise teacher:
for the blood sleeps and fades from my hand, and the matricidal pollution is washed out.
For being fresh, at the hearth of the god Phœbus it was banished by ablations from the sacrifice of swine3.
But it would be a long tale to me from the beginning [to tell] how many I approached with harmless intercourse.
Time removes4 all things growing old at the same time.
And now from pure mouth piously I call on Minerva,, queen of this region, to come to me an assistant;
and she shall possess without the spear both me myself, and my land, and the Argive people, justly faithful, and an ally for ever.
But whether in the places of the Lybian region around the wave of Triton, her native stream, she sets her foot upright or covered1, aiding her friends, or surveys the Phlegræan plain, like a bold leader, let her come, (and she hears even afar, being a goddess,) that she may be a deliverer to me from these things.
CH.
By no means shall Apollo, or the might of Minerva set you free, so as not to perish neglected, not having learnt where in your mind to rejoice, the bloodless food of demons, a shadow.
Dost thou not reply, but dost thou disdain my words, thou who art both nourished for, and devoted to me2.
And alive you shall feed me, not slain at the altar, and you shall hear this hymn that charms you.
Come then, let us also join the dance, since it has seemed good to us to pour forth the hated song, and to declare how our band distributes its­ lots among men;
and we delight in being upright [ministers] of justice.
On him indeed who possesses pure hands no wrath from us steals, but free from harm he passes his life:
but whoever, committing crime, like this man, conceals his bloody hands, close at hand as true witnesses to the dead, we appear effectually as avengers of blood to him.
Mother, 0 mother Night!
thou who brought me forth a punishment3 to the dead and the living, hear!
for the son of Latona makes me disho­ noured, taking away this timid animal, our own victim to expiate a mother's murder4.
But over the victim [be this the strain, one fraught with distracting, mind-destroying, the hymn of the Furies, that charms the mind, without the lyre, that causes shrivelling to mortals.
For prevailing fate has destined to us firmly to hold this office, to pursue those of mortals by whom wicked murders are committed, until [the murderer] hath gone below the earth;
and when dead he is not quite free.
But over the victim [be this the] song, fraught with madness, distracting, mind-destroying, the hymn of the Furies, that charms minds, without the lyre, that causes shrivelling to mortals.
This lot was assigned to us at our birth:
to keep our hands from the immortals, nor is there any common feeder with us;
and of white garments am I ever destitute and devoid.
For I take upon myself the overthrow of houses.
when Mars, being kindred, has slain a friend.
Him intently pursuing, oh!
strong though he be, we destroy, because of newly-shed blood.
And earnestly striving to take away from another this care, and to effect an exemption for the gods in regard to prayers offered to me, and not to come into question of arbitration1:
for Jove deems unworthy of his converse this blood-dripping justly-hated band.
For suddenly leaping from above, I bring down the strength of my foot with heavy fall, limbs that cause the swift2 to trip, an intolerable calamity.
And the thoughts of men even when very lofty beneath the sky, waste away, and decrease down to earth unhonoured, at our approach clad in our black garments, and at the hated dances of our feet.
But falling he knows not this, through his foolish -distraction:
such darkness hovers upon the man on account of his crime, and rumour with many groans proclaims3 the murky cloud against regard to the house.
For 'tis fixed4.
But we are5 both quick of contrivance and persevering in accomplishing it, and awfully mindful of evil deeds, and impla­ cable to mortals, executing an office ignoble and unhonoured.
apart from gods with a sunless torch, in a way alike difficult to be trodden by those who see and by the blind
Who then of mortals dreads not and fears these, hearing my office con­ firmed by fate, given perfect from the gods:
but my ancient honour remains to me, nor do I meet with ignominy, though possessing a station beneath the earth and sunless darkness.
MIN.
From afar I heard the sound of a voice from Seaman­ der, where I occupy1, a land which in truth the leaders and chiefs of the Greeks, a great portion of the captured posses­ sions, assigned for ever to me, root and branch, a chosen gift to the children of Theseus.
From thence I have come, plying an unwearied foot, without wings with rustling noise bran­ dishing my hollow ægis2, having yoked this car to vigorous steeds.
But beholding this strange company, I am by no means afraid, but a wonder is before my eyes.
Who, pray, are you ?
I speak to all in common:
both to this stranger seated at my image, and to you resembling no race of beings produced, nor beheld among goddesses by gods, nor yet like to mortal forms;
but for neighbours to speak ill of one deformed is far from proper, and justice is absent from it.
CH.
You shall hear all things briefly, daughter of Jove ;
for we are the children of dark night, and we are called Furies in the abodes beneath the earth.
MIN.
I know indeed your race, and fame according with your name.
CH.
You shall quickly for certain now hear my honours.
MIN.
I would learn them, if some one would give a plain account.
CH.
We drive man-slayers from their homes.
MIN.
And where is the end of flight to him who has slain?
CH.
Where to rejoice is by no means usual.
MIN.
Do you proclaim such flight for this man too ?
CH.
[Yes.]
For he has thought proper to be the murderer of his mother.
MIN.
Not dreading the wrath of any other necessity?
CH.
For where is such an incentive as to slay a mother ?
MIN.
Two parties being present, half the tale is present!.
CH.
But he would not receive an oath, nor is willing to give one2.
^MIN.
You wish rather to have the fame of justice than to act according to it.
CH. How so?
declare;
for you are not deficient in wise words3.
MIN.
I say, that by oaths, unjust things do not conquer.
CH. But inquire, and adjudge an upright judgment.
MIN.
Would you commit even to me the decision of the cause?
CH.
And how not?
as we reverence you wormy of worthy things1.
MIN.
What do you wish, 0 stranger, to answer in your turn to these things?
But having told your country and race and your misfortunes, aftei that repel this charge;
if, trusting to justice, you sit keeping station at this image beside my shrine, a venerated suppliant after the fashion of Ixion2.
To all these answer something easily understood by me.
OR.
Queen Minerva, first will I remove the great care, [evident] from your last words.
I am not contaminated, nor does pollution adhere to my hand that clasps3 your image.
And I will tell you a great proof of these things.
It is the law that one whose hands are stained with murder be silent, until by a man who cleanses from the impurity of blood, the slaughter of a young victim have sprinkled him with gore.
Long since I have been thus purified at other abodes, both with animals, and flowing streams:
therefore, indeed.
I dismiss this your care.
But what my race is, you shall quickly hear.
I am an Argive, and well do you know my father, Agamem­ non4, leader of naval heroes;
with whom you made the Trojan city of Ilion no city.
He perished not gloriously, having come to his home:
for my dark-souled mother slew him, having wrapt him in artful toils, [and she herself] bore wit­ ness to the murder of the bath.
And I returning home, having been an exile the time before this, slew her who gave me birth, I will not deny it, with the vengeance of retributory slaughter, on account of my dearest father.
And of these things Apollo is in common guilty, declaring sting-like woes to my heart if I should not do some of these things to the murderers.
But do you, whether justly, or not, decide the cause;
for however I shall have fared with you, I shall assent to your decision.
MIN.
The thing is too great, if any mortal thinks to judge it;
nor yet is it lawful for me to determine a cause of slaughter quick to wrath, and especially if you indeed having prepared at the same time, have come a suppliant pure and guiltless to my abodes.
But nevertheless I receive you being blameless in my city.
But these possess an office not easily set aside2, and not having obtained victory:
poison from their minds having fallen hereafter upon the plain [will be] an intolerable dire disease.
These things, indeed, are so:
that both remain, but to dismiss both, without injury is impossible for me3.
But since this thing has come hither, choosing' sworn judges of murder I will make a law for ever.
But do you call as evidence and proofs, oaths to aid your cause.
But I having selected the best of my citizens will come, to determine this matter rightly, those who give no unjust oath in their minds5.
CH.
Now [will] there be a revolution of6 new laws, if the cause and guilt of this matricide shall prevail.
This deed now by its facility7 will prompt all mortals to [the same] and many certain sufferings from wounds inflicted by children, await parents in time hereafter.
For neither will any wrath of us men-regarding Mænads creep on because of evil deeds:
I will leave1 all death unpunished, and one will ask from another, declaring the evil deeds of his kindred a cessation, and remission from ills no longer certain2:
but the wretch in vain will console himself.
Nor let any one struck by misfor­ tune invoke us, pouring forth these words, 0 Justice, and 0 thrones of the Furies!
With such expressions some father perhaps, or mother newly afflicted, may wail a wailing:
since the house of Justice falls.
Some times fear, sitting in the right place, and controlling the soul, will terrify it.
It is good to grow wise under sorrow.
But who keeping no fear in his blithesome heart, either city or mortal alike, would any longer reverence justice ?
Praise neither a life free from rule, nor lorded over;
to every mean the god affords power, but other things he differently regards.
But I speak a fitting word;
insolence is the child of impiety, most assuredly;
but from sanity of mind3 tomes prosperity dear to all and much sought.
But altogether I say to you, revere the altar of Justice, nor, looking to gain, dishonour it by trampling on it with godless foot.
For punishment will follow:
a deci­ sive end awaits.
Therefore let every one honour duly the sanctity of parents, and reverence the intercourse of hos­ pitable abodes.
He who is willingly just without neces­ sity shall not be unhappy;
utterly destroyed, at least, he can never be.
But I declare that the transgressor who dares things contrary, will throw all things into confusion without justice, land shall perish] by violence in time, when trouble has seized his sails, the sail-yard being broken.
And he invokes those who listen not, in the midst of an uncon- qucrable whirlpool;
but the deity laughs at the bold man, beholding him, no longer boasting, bound in calamity from which is no escape, nor surmounting the summit:
but having dashed his former prosperity on the rock of Justice, unwept, unknown, he is for ever lost.
MIN.
Proclaim, herald1, and keep back the people:
and let the piercing Tuscan trumpet, filled with mortal breath, pour forth its thrilling voice to the multitude.
For this assembly being filled, it is fitting to be silent, and that even all the city for ever learn my laws, and this man, that the cause may be duly determined2.
CH. King Apollo, rule the things that belong to you.
What have you to do with this matter, say.
Ap.
Both to give evidence have I come (for this man is a suppliant of my dwelling3 and a guest of my abodes;
and I am the cleanser of this murder) and [I have come] myself to plead the cause4 with him;
but I bear the blame of the slaughter of this mau's mother.
But do thou [Minerva].
open, as you know how, this cause, with a view to deciding it.
MIN.
It is with you to speak, but I open the cause1:
for the accuser, speaking first from the beginning, should be rightly the explainer of the matter.
CH.
We are many, indeed, but we will speak briefly:
and o you answer word for word, giving it in your turn:
say first if you slew your mother.
OR.
I slew her:
of this there is no denial.
CH.
This now, indeed, is one of the three wrestlings2.
OR.
You speak these boasting words on me not yet prostrate.
CH. Nevertheless it behoves you to declare how you slew her.
OR.
I will tell;
with sword-drawing hand having cut her on the neckCH.
But by whom were you persuaded, and by whose c ounsels?
OR.
By the oracles of this god;
and he bears witness to me.
CH.
Did the prophet advise you to slay your mother?
OR.
And so far ever I blame not Fortune.
CH.
But if the condemning vote shall seize lou, perhaps you will say other things.
OR.
I am confident, and my father will send aid from the tomb3.
CH.
Put trust now in the dead, having slain your mother!
OR.
For she had the concurrence of two pollutions.
CH.
How so?
inform the judges of these things.
OR.
Having slain her husband she murdered my father.
CH.
Therefore you, indeed, live, but she is free [from the punishment] of slaughter.
OR.
But why did you not drive her out by exile when alive1 ?
CH.
She was not the kindred of the man whom she slew.
OR.
But am I allied by blood to my mother?
CH. Yes, for did she not nourish you within her zone, 0 blood-stained?
do you disown the most dear blood of your mother?
OR.
Now do you give testimony.
But declare for me.
Apollo, if I slew her with justice:
for we do not deny that we have done it, as it is done:
but if this blood seem to your mind justly or unjustly shed, judge, that I may speak to these.
Ap.
I will speak justly to you, this great council of Mi­ nerva, and being a prophet I will not lie.
Never at any time have I spoken in my prophetic shrine either concerning man, woman, or city, what Jove father of the Olympians has not commanded.
Learn, with respect to this justice, of how great power it is;
but I bid you obey the counsel of my father, for an oath by no means is more powerful than Jove.
On.
Jove, as you say, gave this oracle2, that you should tell this Orestes, having avenged the murder of his father by no means to regard the reverence due to his mother.
Ap. [Yes.]
For it is not the same thing that a noble hero should die, honoured with Jove-given sceptres, and that, too, by a woman, not by impetuous far-darting bows, like an Amazon, but as Pallas shall hear, and they who sit to decide by vote concerning this matter.
For having received him on his re­ turn from the expedition, where he had gained the greatest honours in the best manner according to the opinion of those well-inclined to him3, in the washing-place as he was passing through the bath, and at the end covered him with a robe, and having entangled her husband in an artfully-woven eir­ cular garment she struck him.
This fate, indeed, of the hero all-venerable, the commander of ships, has been told to you:
this woman have I described as such, that the assembly may be stung with indignation, which has been appointed to determine this cause.
CH.
Jove by your account respects the death of a father;
but he himself bound his aged father Saturn1.
How do you say that these things are not contrary to those ?
But I call you as witnesses to hear these things.
Ap. 0 all-hated monsters, abhorred by the gods, from fetters, indeed, (there is a cure for this) even many a liberating device might have released him2.
But when the dust has drunk up the blood of a man once dead, there is no raising it up.
For these things my father has not made a charm;
but he appoints all other things turning them up and down, in no wise panting in his strength.
CH.
But see how you [defend] this man contrary to justice, that he may escape.
Having poured out on the plain the kindred blood of his mother, shall he then inhabit the house of his father in Argos?
using which of the public altars?
and what layer of his tribe shall receive him?
AP.
This, too, will I declare, and learn how rightly I speak.
She is not the mother who is called the parent of the child, but nurse of the newly-sown offspring3.
But the male is the generative source, and she like a stranger preserves the plant for a stranger, for those whom the god may not have injured.
But I will shew you a proof of these words:
a father might be without a mother;
the daughter of Olympian Jove is close at hand as a witness, not1 nourished in the darkness of the womb, but such a plant as no goddess could have produced.
But 1, Pallas, both in other things, as far as I am able, will make your state and people great, and I sent this man as an inmate of your abodes, that he might be faithful for ever.
And may you possess him as an ally, 0 goddess, and his descendants;
and may these things remain eternally, that posterity observe the covenant of these.
MIN.
Now I bid these according to their opinion pass a just sentence, as enough has been said.
CH.
By us now, indeed, every shaft has been shot;
and I wait to hear how the contest will be determined.
MIN.
For why?
how giving sentence shall I be unblamed by you?
CH.
You have heard what you have heard, but passing a vote with your heart, revere, 0 strangers, your oath.
MIN.
You Attic people now hear the law, judging the first cause of the shedding of blood and moreover this court of judges shall remain hereafter for ever to the people of Ægeus.
But for2 this hill of Mars, the seat and tents of the Amazons.
wren they came waging war through hatred of Theseus, and then built towers opposite to this new lofty-towered city3;
and they sacrificed to Mars, whence the rock derives its name, and the hill of Mars—in this [hill], then, the reverence of the citizens, and its ally, fear shall restrain them from acting un­ justly, both by day and by night alike, if the citizens them­ selves do not tamper with4 the laws.
But by an evil influx and by mild polluting the clear water, never wilt thou find a draught.
I counsel my citizens with regard1 to venerate neither anarchy nor tyranny;
and not to east all fear out of the city.
For who of mortals, that fears nothing, is just?
Awed justly therefore by such an object of reverence, you would have both a defence of your country and safeguard of your city, such as no men possess.
Neither among the Scythians nor in the realms of Pelops have I appointed this court.
Untouched2 by gain, venerable, quick to vengeance, a watchful guard over those who sleepy
This exhortation, in­ deed, I have extended for my citizens in regard to the future.
But it behoves you to rise, and give your votes, and determine the cause reverencing the oath.
My say is said.
CH.
And yet I counsel you by no means to dishonour this dire band of [the infernal] region.
Ap.
And I, for my part, bid you fear both my oracles and those of Jove, nor to render them fruitless.
CH.
But you regard matters of bloodshed, not having beei.
allotted such office;
and no longer remaining here will you.
utter pure oracles.
AP.
Was my father, too, in any way mistaken
In his counsels in the supplication of Ixion, for the first slaughter?
CH. Say on:
but I, not having obtained my justice, will heavily again haunt this land.
Ap.
But both among the young and the old gods you are unhonoured:
but I shall prevail.
CH.
Such things you did also in the house of Pheres4, and persuaded the Fates to make mortals free from death.
AP.
Is it not just to do good to him who reveres you, especially when he may chance to be in need of it ?
CH.
You indeed having overcome the old deities, deceived with wine, the ancient goddesses.
Ap.
You indeed presently, not having the end of your cause, shall vomit your poison, by no means hurtful to your enemies.
CH.
Since you, a youth, are riding down me in years, I will remain auditor of this cause, as being doubtful whether I should be enraged at the eity.
MIN.
This is my business, that I last determine the cause;
but I will add this1, my vote, in favour of Orestes :
for there is no mother who produced me.
But I praise the male in all things, save in obtaining marriage, with all my soul;
and I am entirely on my father's side.
Thus I will not set higher price on the fate of a woman who slew her husband, the lord of the house.
But Orestes prevails, even if he be judged with equal votes.
Cast out the lots from the vessel as quickly as possible, you to whom of the judges this office has been assigned.
OR. 0 Phœbus Apollo, how will the contest be deter­ mined?
CH. 0 black Night, mother, dost thou behold these things ?
OR.
Now is it for me the moment of the noose, or to see the light.
CH.
But for us to perish, or to extend our honours rather.
Ap.
Count rightly the casting out of the votes, strangers, reverencing justice in the division;
for from one suffrage being absent arises great calamity, and one vote cast in, raises up an house.
MIN.
This man has escaped the doom of blood:
for the number of the votes is equal.
OR.
0 Pallas, 0 thou who hast preserved my house, and me deprived of my native land, you in truth have restored me to my home;
and one of the Greeks will say the man again is2 an Argive, and dwells among his paternal possessions," by the will of Pallas and of Loxias and of the third preserver Jove who rules all things, who paying respect to my father's fate preserves me beholding these defenders of the cause of my mother.
But I to this country and to your people hereafter, for all time however long having made an oath, now depart home, that no helmsman of the land having come hither shall bear against you the well-prepared spear.
For we ourselves being then in the tomb, to those who violate my present oaths, will, by calamities not to be avoided, render­ ing their march full of dismay and evil omens, cause them to repent of their toil.
But to those who assist and honour ever this city of Pallas with confederate spear, to them we will be kindly disposed.
And farewell both thou [0 goddess], and the people who inhabit the city, may you possess a contest not to be avoided by your enemies, both the source of safety and of victory with the spear.
CH1. 0 youthful gods, you have ridden down the ancient laws, and have snatched [him] from my hands.
But I dis­ honoured, miserable, inflamed with rage, in this land, ah, ah!
will pour forth, in return for my sorrow, a drop from my heart on the ground causing sterility, and from it a venom destroving leaves and children (0 Justice!) rushing on the plain, shall cast mortal-destroying stains in the country.
Shall I groan ?
what shall I do ?
what will become of me ?
I have suffered things intolerable to the citizens2.
Ah!
most wretched in truthS are the daughters of Night grieving for their dis­ grace.
MIN.
Be persuaded by me, so as not to bear it hardly:
for you have not been conquered, but the cause in truth fell out with equal votes, not for your disgrace.
Besides clear testi­ monies from Jove were present, and he who gave the oracle, he himself bore witness, that Orestes having done these things should not suffer ill.
But do not you let fall your heavy wrath on this land, be not enraged, nor cause sterility, sending forth drops from your lungs, dire darts consuming the seed.
For I most justly promise to you, that you, seated at the shining hearths, shall possess temples and shrines in a just land, honoured by these citizens.
CH. 0 youthful gods, you have trampled on the ancient laws, and have snatched [him] from my hands.
But I dis.
honoured, miserable, inflamed with rage, in this land, ah, ah will pour forth, in return for my sorrow, a drop from my heart on the ground causing sterility, and from it a venom destroy­ ing leaves and children (0 Justice!) rushing on the plain, shall cast mortal-destroying stains in the country.
Shall I groan ?
what shall I do?
what will become of me?
I have suffered things intolerable to the citizens.
Ah!
most wretched in truth are the daughters of Night grieving for their disgrace.
MIN.
You are not dishonoured, nor, through your excessive wrath, do you goddesses make the land of mortals incurable.
I too have trust in Jove,—and what need to say any thing of that?
And I alone' of gods know the keys of the abodes in which the thunder is sealed up:
but there is no need of this.
But persuaded by me, do not cast forth upon the ground the fruit of a froward tongue, causing all things to turn out ill.
Lull the bitter rage of the black billow, as venerated and a dweller with me:
and hereafter having for ever the first-fruits of the sacrifices of this ample realm, for children and the rites of marriage, you will praise these my words.
CH.
That I should have suffered these things!
alas!
that I wretched should dwell on earth!
alas!
a dishonourable pollu­ tion !
Therefore I breathe forth my rage, and all my wrath.
Oh!
oh!
Earth!
alas!
what anguish pierces my sides!
hear my rage, mother Night!
for the crafty wiles of the gods have deprived me of my public2 honours as if of no account.
MIN.
I will bear with your passion;
for you are older;
and certainly indeed you are mueh more wise than I:
but to me too Jove has given no small share of wisdom.
But you having come into a land of strangers will be loved by this coun­ try:
I foretell these things:
for time as it rolls on will be more fraught with honour to these citizens.
And you shall possess a seat at the abode of Ereetheus, honoured by men and by the train of women, such as you never could obtain from other mortals.
But do not you in my realms cast either bloody whetstones, a destruction to the entrails of youths, rendering them frantic with rage not excited by wine;
nor rousing1 them like the heart of cocks, among my citizens plant Mars both civil and bold against each other.
Let there be a foreign war, not a present broil with difficulty, in which there shall be a violent love of glory;
but I mention not the fight of the domestic bird.
It is allowed you to choose such things from me, doing well, receiving well, well honoured, to share this god-loved country.
CH.
That I should have suffered these things!
alas!
that I wretched should dwell on earth!
alas!
a dishonourable pollu­ tion!
Therefore I breathe forth my rage, and all my wrath.
Oh!
oh!
Earth!
alas!
what anguish pierces my sides!
hear my rage, mother Night!
for the crafty wiles of the gods have deprived me of my public honours as if of no account.
MIN.
By no means shall I be tired of speaking what is good for you;
that you may never say, that you an ancient goddess, did through me a younger, and through men that dwell in cities, depart dishonoured, inhospitably driven from this land.
But if indeed the reverence of Persuasion is holy in your eyes, the soothing and winning power of my tongue, you then would remain:
but if you are unwilling to remain, neither justly would you bring upon this city any vengeance or anger, or hurt upon the people.
For it is in your ehoiee to be a sharer of this land with me at least, duly honoured for ever.
On. Queen Minerva, what seat do you say that I shall possess ?
MIN.
One free from all misery:
and do thou accept it.
CH. Grant I accept it, but what honour then awaits me ?
MIN.
That no house shall be prosperous without you.
CH.
Will you bring this to pass, so that I shall have so great power ?
MIN.
[Yes.]
For we will render events fortunate to him that reveres you.
CH.
And will you warrant this to me for all time ?
MIN.
Yes;
for it is unlawful for me to say, what I will not perform.
CH.
You seem to soothe me, and I depart from my rage.
MIN.
Therefore being in this land you shall possess friends.
CH.
What then do you bid me wish to this land?
MIN.
Such things as regard good victory1, and these from the earth, and from the dews of the sea, and from heaven, and the gales of the winds blowing with elear sunshine to come upon this land;
and that the fruit of the earth and of flocks flowing plenteously abounding to the citizens fail not with time, and that there be safety of mortal seed.
But may you be more inclined to root out the impious:
for I cherish free from calamity, like a gardener, this race of just men here.
Such be thy care.
But with respect to illustrious warlike contests, I will not endure not to honour this city with vic­ tory among mortals.
CH.
I will accept the fellowship of Pallas, nor will I despise a city whieli even all-powerful Jove and Mars regard as the defence of the gods, the delight of the deities of Greece, protecting their altars.
For which I pray, prophesying benevolently, that the bright ray of the sun cause to spring1 from the earth goods useful for life in abundance.
MIN.
I willingly do these things for these my citizens, having settled in this place these mighty deities, and hard to be appeased:
for they have obtained by lot to administer all things regarding men.
But he who has not found them gentle, knows not whence come the ills of life:
for the sins of his forefathers lead him away to these, and silent destruction with hostile wrath lays him low even while talking big.
On.
And let not the tree-destroying blight breathe—I speak my kindness-and let [not there be] the scorching heat that blasts the buds of plants, preventing them from passing the bounds of their places;
nor let the fruit-spoiling black disease creep on;
and may this country rear at the appointed time flocks very plenteous with double increase:
let the race of men that enjoys the riches of the earth, adore the gainful gift of the deities.
MIN.
Do you hear these things, guardians of the city, what she accomplishes ?
for the awful Erinnys has great power both with the immortals, and with those beneath the earth, and with respect to men they manifestly and powerfully bring about to some indeed the song, but to others on the contrary affording a life dimmed with tears.
On.
And I deprecate youth-destroying untimely events;
and do ye2 grant wedded lives to lovely maids, ye supreme ruling goddesses, and fates, sisters born of the same mother as we, deities of strict laws, common to every house, and in all time heavy in your just visitations in all things the most honoured of the gods.
MiN.
I rejoice therefore, [these goddesses] willingly accom­ plishing these things to my country;
but I love the eyes of Persuasion, because she has watched over my tongue and mouth against these fiercely refusing.
But Jove of the forum has conquered, and our strife to do good' prevails for ever.
CH.
And I pray that sedition, insatiate of ills, may never toar in this city:
nor that the dust having drunk the black blood of the citizens, bear away from the city the curse of slaughter for slaughter, through the rage for vengeance2.
But may they render to each other in turn joyful offices with thoughts for common weal, and hate with one mind:
for this is a remedy for many things among mortals.
MIN.
Do you then, returning2 to right thoughts, find the way of a good tongue ?
From these dread faces I see great gain to these citizens.
For you ever benevolent greatly honouring these benevolent, with respect to your rightly-just land and city shall all be illustrious while you live3.
CH.
Farewell, in the prosperity of wealth, farewell people of the city, sitting near to Jove, dear to the dear virgin, wise in time:
and you being under the wings of Pallas does fathe Jove regard.
MIN.
Farewell you too:
but it behoves me first to go to assign your abodes.
To the sacred light of these conductors go, and while these dread victims are sacrificed to you, rush­ ing beneath the earth, keep back from the country what is hurtful, but send what is advantageous for the victory of the city.
And do you sons of Cranaus inhabiting the city, con­ duct these new settlers.
And may the good recollection of benefits remain to the citizens.
On.
Farewell, farewell again, I repeat it, all you in the city, deities and mortals, inhabiting the city of Pallas.
But honouring duly my settling among you, in no respect shall you blame the events of life.
Mix.
I approve the words of these your vows, and I will send the light of blazing torches to the infernal and nether regions, with ministers who guard my image justly.
For let the eye of all the land of Theseus come forth, an illustrious band of youths, women, and a train of aged women;
and clothed in purple-dyed garments honour4 [these deities,] and let the light of the torches flash forth:
that new fellowship received into your land hereafter, may show their good will by events that prosper men.
AT.
Depart home, ye mighty honoured virgin daughters of Night, with a friendly escort.
(But do you speak well- omened words, inhabitants), in the ancient caves beneath the earth highly honoured with honours and burnt victims, and in your happy lot.
But applaud all ye people !
And propi­ tious and benevolent to this land come hither, ye dread powers, and delighted with the blazing torch:
and on the way now break forth into songs.
But libations shall be ever in your temples accompanied by torches:
to the citizens of Pallas all-seeing Jove and the favouring Fate descend together.
Break forth now into sougs.
The flight of the Danaides from E'gypt, accompanied by their father to Argos, and their supplication for protection against the lawless nup­ tials threatened them by the sons of Ægyptus.
CHORUS, THE DAUGHTERS OF DANAUS.PELASGUS.HERALD.CHORUS.
May Jove, indeed, the god of suppliants bene­ volently regard our naval train having set sail from the mouths of the Nile with its fine sands.
But having left the divine land bordering on Syria we fled, sentenced to no banish­ ment by the vote of the city, on account of bloodshed, but abhorring the man-shunning and impious nuptials of the sons of Ægyptus our kindred.
But our father Danaus both our prime counsellor and leader of our flight, arranging these things, determined on the best of two evils (viz., the nuptials, or flight,) that we should fly with all speed over the billow of the deep, and put to at the land of Argos, from whence, in­ deed, our lineage, from the heifer rendered frantic by the gad- fly, and from the touch and inspiration of Jove, boasts to be derived.
To what country therefore more friendly than this can we come with these wool-wreathed branches of suppliants in our hands ?
02 city, and land, and limpid water, and you heavenly gods, and you aire-punishipg infernal deities possess­ ing temples, and third [ called upon] preserver Jove, reecive this suppliant female train with a merciful spirit of the country:
but the male-abounding insolent swarm, sprung from Ægyp­ tus, before placing their foot in this marshy land, send thou into the deep with their swift ship, and there having met with a furious whirlwind, with thunder, lightning, and with the shower-bearing winds of the fell sea, let them perish, before at any time ascending our unwilling beds, from which Justice restrains them, having made their own1 us here their kindred.
But now invoking2 the divine calf, my avenger beyond the sea, and the son of the flower-cropping heifer, our progenitor, from the breathing of Jove.
But the fated time rightly con­ firmed the touch [of Jove] in the name [of her son,] and brought forth Epaphus ;
whom mentioning now in the fertile regions of his ancient mother, calling to mind her former troubles, partly now will I shew creditable proofs, and partly some things will appear, I know, unlikely, although being unexpected3.
But one will ken words [when I have spoken] -it length.
But if any augur chances to be near in the land, rearing our mournful wail, he will think that he hears the wife of Tereus wretched of device;
and the hawk-chased nightingale ;
who driven from her haunts and the rivers laments with new wail on account of her accustomed haunts ;
and trills a song on the fate of the boy, how he perished by the very hand of his cruel mother, having met with her wrath.
So I, too, lamenting in Ionian strains rend my tender cheek that was cherished beside the Nile, and my heart unacquainted with tears.
And I crop the flower of sad complaints, fearing my friends, if there is any one who has regard for this flight of ours from the land of Aeria4.
But ye gods, authors of our race, hear, duly regarding justice, or if ye do not grant suc­ cess in obtaining what is contrary to right, but hating inso­ lence in your souls, you should be just in regard to nuptials5
But there is oven to those who fly from war, being hard pressed, an altar, a defence from calamity4, honoured by the deities.
Would that 'the will] of Jove would bring to pass all things truly.
The counsel of Jove is not easily traced out, yet in all things it shines forth, even in darkness, with black calamity to articulate-voiced men.
But it falls firmly not upon its back2, if a thing be perfected by the head of Jove:
for the ways of the [divine] breast stretch thick and shady, difficult to discover.
But he smites abandoned mortals, look­ ing down3 from his high-towered heights, and no one arms violence unpunished by the deity:
the [divine] mind sitting aloft4 upon holy seats, nevertheless from that place takes ven­ geance on it.
But let him look to the insolence of mortal men, how a youthful stock shoots anew, blooming6 on account of my nuptials, with ill-advised purpose, and having furious thoughts, an inevitable sting, and having resolved on an in­ fatuated deed through disappointment6.
Such wretched suf­ ferings I lamenting recount, mournful, grievous, drawing tears, ah !
ah!
suited to funeral strains :
I alive honour7 myself with lamentations.
I suppliant beseech the Apian land, and may you hear kindly my barbarian voice.
But oft I fall upon my linen garments with rendings, and my Sidonian head­ dress.
But to the gods just and perfect rites8, matters hav­ ing happened fortunately, shall be abundantly afforded, when death is absent.
Ah!
ah!
ah !
troubles difficult to be judged !
where will this billow carry us ?
I suppliant beseech the Apian land, and may you hear kindly my barbarian voice.
But oft I fall upon my linen garments with rendings.
The­ par indeed and the wooden house with flaxen sails8, keep­ ang out the sea, has wafted me with the breezes untroubled by tempests :
nor do I blame it:
but hereafter may the all- seeing father bring to pass a propitious end1, that the mighty seed of our venerable mother escape, alas!
from the beds of men unwedded, virgin.
But again may the chaste daughter of Jove willingly regard me willing, keeping fixed upon me her dread countenance :
and with all her might let her a vir­ gin defending virgins from persecutions, be our deliverer2
But if not, a blackened sun-burnt3 race to Zagreus4, the many­ guest-receiving Jove of the dead will we approach with these suppliant boughs, dying by the noose, not having obtained [the favour] of the Olympian gods.
0 Jove5, 0 wrath from the deities pursuing Io !
But I ken the vengeance of the wife [of Jove ] which overcomes heaven :
for a tempest will come from a fell blast.
And then Jove will be subject to unjust rumours, having slighted the son of the heifer, whom he himself once begot, now keeping his eyes averted from our prayers;
but may he favourable hear us from above when invoked.
0 Jove, 0 wrath from the deities pursuing Io !
But I ken the vengeance of the wife [of Jove,] which overcomes heaven :
for a tempest will come from a fell blast.
DANAUS.
My children, it behoves us to be prudent:
and ye have come with me your prudent faithful aged father con­ ductor of your voyage.
And with respect to your behaviour on land now I bid you assume6 prudence to observe my words, engraving them on your minds.
I see dust, the voiceless messenger of an army;
the axle-driven naves are not silent, and I behold a bucklered and spear-brandishing crowd, with horses, and eurved chariots.
Perhaps the riders of this land may be advancing to us as spies, having heard [of us] from messengers.
But whether harmless, or enraged1 with fell wrath, they are rushing on this train, it is better, on every account, 0 virgins, to sit down at this mound of the gods who preside over assemblies.
But an altar is better than a tower, an unbroken shield.
But as quickly as possible go, and hold­ in- reverently in your left2 hands the white-wreathed suppliant boughs, ornaments of awful Jove, reply to the strangers with modest and sad and fitting words, as becomes those in a strange land, clearly relating these your bloodless flights.
But first indeed let not boldness of voice follow, and let no vain look proceed from your modest foreheads, and quiet eye.
And be not first to speak nor tedious in your talk :
the people in this country greatly dislike it.
But be sure to yield:
you are a needy stranger exile;
for it becomes not the lowly to be bold of speech.
CH.
Father, prudently to the prudent do you speak.
But we mindful will observe these your wise injunctions ;
and m ay Jove the author of our race regard us.
DAN.
Delay not now, but let there be an accomplishment of your plan3.
On.
I would now have my seat beside you.
DAN.
0 Jove, pity us not utterly consumed by troubles.
CH. Let him.
regard us in truth with favouring eye:
he willing it, these things will turn out well4.
DAN.
Invoke now also this bird of Jove.CH.
We invoke the preserving rays of the sun, and holy Apollo, a god once exiled from heaven.
Knowing this fate, let him be propitious to mortals.
DAN.
Let him be propitious indeed, and readily afford succour.
CH.
Whom then of these deities shall I yet invoke ?
DAN.
I behold this trident, a sign of the god.
On.
But he has brought us well hither, and may he receive us well in the land,DAN.
This other is Mercury in the rites of the Greeks.
On.
Let him then announce good tidings to us freed1,DAN.
But reverence the common altar of all these kings, and sit in a holy place like a floek of doves, through fear of hawks of the same feather, kindred enemies, and polluting your race.
How can a bird that devours a bird be pure ?
and how eould he who marries an unwilling maid from an unwilling father2 be pure ?
not even when dead in Hades can he who has done these things escape the blame of lewdness.
And there, as is the tale, another Jove who passes the last judgments among the dead, judges crimes.
Consider, and answer in this fashion, that this matter may turn out well to you.
PELASGUS.
Of what country is this band that we address, not Grecian in its garb, delicately attired in barbarian robes, and in many folds ?
for this attire of women is not Argolic, nor from the realms of Greece.
But how you have dared fearlessly to come to this country, neither [announced] by heralds, and without a public host, without conductors, this is wonderful.
Boughs indeed after the fashion of suppliants are laid by you at the altars of the gods who preside over assemblies.
The Grecian land will gain by conjecture this only, (viz., that you are suppliants,) and it were just to guess many other things, were there not a voice to inform me present.
CH.
You have spoken concerning our dress a true speech.
But whether shall I speak to you as a private person, or a sceptre-bearing guardian of the temple, or chief of the city3?
PEL.
Answer to these things, and speak boldly to me:
for I am Pelasgus, son of earth-born Palæcthon, leader of this land.
And from me their king the race of Pelasgians aptly taking their name enjoys this land, and I rule all the territory through which Algus flows, and Strymon, towards the setting sun.
But I claim as my borders the land of the Perræbians1, and the parts beyond Pindus.
beside the Pæonians, and the mountains of Dodona :
but the boundary of the watery deep cuts it off:
and beyond these parts I rule.
But this plain of the Apian land long since was named on account of a man skilled in healing arts :
for Apis having come from the country of Naupactus the healing-prophetic son of Apollo, cleared this land from men-devouring monsters, which in truth the earth defiled by pollutions of ancient blood produced, fierce animals, a dragon band, a dire fellowship.
Of these Apis having blamelessly made complete and liberating remedies for the Argive land, found hereafter his memory in prayers as his reward.
Having now signs from me you can declare your race, and speak farther :
a long oration indeed the city loves not.
CH.
My speech shall be short and clear.
We boast our­ selves Argives as to our race, the seed of the heifer happy in her son:
and I will prove all these things I say to be true.
PEL.
You relate incredible things, 0 strangers, for me to hear, that this your race is Argive.
For you are more like to Lybian women, and by no means to the natives of my country.
The Nile might nurture such an offspring, and a like Cyprian image is stamped in female forms by male artists;
and I hear that the wandering Indians ride on pannier-packed camels fleet as steeds, in their land bordering on the Ethio­ pians :
and by all means I had conjectured that you were the unwedded flesh-eating Amazons, if you had carried bows.
Instructed I would know this farther, how your race and seed is Argive.
CH.
They say that lo was once key-bearer [of the] temple of Juno in this Argive land, whom, as chiefly and great rumour prevails * *PEL.
Is there not a tale that Jove mingled with a mortal ?
CHO.
And this intercourse without the knowledge of June **PEL.
How then did this strife of the powers end ?
On.
The Argive goddess made the woman an heifer.
PEL. Did Jove still approach the well-horned heifer.
On.
They say [that he did so,] likening his body to a cow­ leaping bull.
PEL.
What truly on this did the mighty wife of Jove ?CH.
She placed over the heifer an all-seeing keeper.
PEL.
What all-viewing herdsman do you mean ?
CH.
Argus, whom son of the Earth Mercury slew.
PEL.
What other thing did she yet frame against the in­ fated heifer ?
CH.
A cow-chasing gad-fly, quick in motion :
those near the Nile call it a brize1.
PEL.
Accordingly it chased her from the land in long Hight.
CH.
And you have spoken all these things agreeing with me.
PEL.
Moreover she came to Canobus and to Memphis.
Cir.
And Jove laying hands on her planted an offspring.
PEL.
Who then is the divine calf that boasts to be sprung from an heifer ?
CH.
Epaphus truly called from deliverance.
PEL. *CH. Lybia enjoying the name of a very great land.
PEL.
What other branch yet of this [heifer] do you men­ tion?
CH. Belus having two sons, the father of my father here.
PEL.
Tell me now the all-wise name of this2 man.
CH. Danaus :
and his brother has fifty sons.
PEL.
Of him, too, declare the name in plain terms,Cir. Ægyptus ;
and knowing my ancient race you should act so as to support this Argive train.
PEL.
You seem now to me to have shared this land of old :
but how have you dared to leave your paternal abodes ?
What mischance has befallen you ?
CH.
King of the Pelasgians, the ills of men are various:
and no where can you behold the same wing of trouble:
since who would have expected that this unhoped-for flight would Jiave driven me to Argos, allied to our race of old, tremblirg through hate of the marriage bed ?
PEL.
What do you say that you entreat from these gods of the assembly, holding white-wreathed new-cropt boughs ?
CH.
That I may not become a slave to the race of Ægyptus.
PEL.
Whether do you mean on account of hatred, or on account of its being unlawful?
CH.
Who would purchase1 [by a dowry] their kindred as their lords ?
PEL.
Thus, indeed, greater strength increases to mortals.
CH.
And from the wretched it is easy to turn away.
PEL.
How then can I be pious towards you ?
CH.
By not giving us up to the sons of Ægyptus do­ manding us.
PEL.
You speak grievous things, to raise a new war.
CH.
But Justice defends her allies.
PEL.
If perchance she was a sharer of their affairs from the beginning.
CH.
Revere the stern of the state thus crowned.
PEL.
I shudder beholding these shaded seats.
On;
.
Grievous, indeed, is the wrath of Jove who guards the suppliant.
Son of Palæcthon, hear me with willing heart, king of the Pelasgians.
Behold me a suppliant, an exile, a wanderer, like a white-spotted2 heifer on the lofty rocks, where trusting for aid she lows telling to the herdsman her troubles.
PEL.
I behold a youthful band3 shaded with new-cropt boughs [at the altars] of these gods who preside over the games.
But may this business of the guests of our city be unattended with hurt:
nor let strife arise to the city from unexpected and sudden things, for these the city wants not.
CH. May
Then,-is, the goddess of suppliants, daughter of lot-directing Jove, regard in truth our harmless flight:
but do you though being an old man4 in mind, learn from one younger;
reverencing a suppliant, you shall not be reduced to want5.
gifts offered to the gods from a pure man.
PEL.
By no means do you sit at the hearth of my house :
but if the city be polluted in common, together let the people take care to work out remedies:
but I could not perform a promise, before at least having- communicated with all these of!
citizens concerning these things.
CH.
You are the city, and you are the people, being a ruler accountable to none, you have sway over the altar, the hearth of the land :
by your sole-deciding nod, and on a sole-sceptred throne you determine everything;
beware of pollution.
PEL.
May pollution, indeed, be upon my enemies:
but I cannot aid you without harm, nor again is it prudent to reject these prayers.
But I am perplexed, and fear holds my mind, whether to act, or not to act, and to take my chance.
CH. Look to the beholder on high, the protector of troubled mortals, who.
sitting [as suppliants] before their kindred, obtain not lawful justice.
Therefore the wrath of Jove guar­ dian of suppliants waits upon the wailing of the sufferer, that cannot be appeased.
PEL.
If the sons of .
Egyptus have power over you by the law of your state, saying that they are nearest of kin, who would wish to oppose them ?
Ye needs must therefore prove according to the laws of your home that they have no autho­ rity over you.
CH.
May I never at any time then become subject to the power of males:
but I mark out a star-guided remedy of the wretched marriage by flight:
and having taken Justice an ally, do thou determine according to the reverence due to the gods.
PEL.
The judgment is not easy to judge:
choose not me as iudge.
But I said even before, not without the people would I do these things, not even though ruler, lest at any time the people shall say, if perchance an.
thing fall out not such [as we wish,]1 honouring strangers you have destroyed the city.
CH.
Jove allied to both, inclining to one side, regards these things, distributing as is right unjust things to the bad, but the rewards of piety to the just 3.
Wherefore, these being equally inelined, are you pained to do what is just?
PEL.
There is need of deep thought4, so that the clear- sighted eye may, without dizziness, reach the bottom of deep preserving thought, like a diver:
that these things harmless.
first indeed to the city, and to ourselves, may turn out well and that neither strife lay hold of the pledges1, nor that we, having given up you placed here in the seats of the gods.
bring on ourselves a dire fellow-dweller the all-destroying avenging god, who, not even in the abode of Hades frees the dead.
Does there not seem to be need of saving thought?
CH. Consider, and be most justly a pious receiver of stran­ gers, betray not the exile driven from afar by godless expul­ sion:
nor behold me dragged as a pledge from the seats sacred to many gods, 0 you who possess the whole sway of the land.
But consider the insolence of men, and guard against their wrath.
In no wise endure to behold the suppli- -tilt led from the images in spite of Justice, like a steed, and the seizing of my fillets and robes woven with many threads.
For know, whatever you determine, there awaits your children and your house to suffer a like justice.
Consider these just commands of Jove.PEL.
And truly I have considered;
and the matter is driven to this:
it is absolutely necessary to undertake a great war either with these (viz. the gods) or with those (viz. the sons of Ægyptus):
and it is compacted with nails, like a ship put together by naval wedges.
But without sorrow by no means will there be a turning aside.
And, indeed, when pos­ sessions are borne as plunder from the house, a heap greater than the loss, and which completely fills it up may arise from another quarter by the kindness of bounteous Jove 2.
And the tongue having darted forth unseasonable things grievous, and provoking wrath, there may be other words to soothe the former.
But it is necessary by all means to sacrifice, and for many victims to be slain for many gods, remedies of calamity, that kindred blood be not shed.
Certainly I altogether pass by this strife;
but I wish to be rather ignorant of, than acquainted with ills:
but may matters fall out well, contrary to my expectation.
CH.
Hear the end of many modest speeches.
PEL.
I hear,--and speak, your words shall not escape me.
CH. I have girdles and zones, that confine my robes.
PEL.
These arc befitting to the condition of women.
CH.
From these therefore, know, an excellent contrivancePEL.
Say:
what words are these that you are about to speak ?
CH.
Unless you shall promise to this train something that may be trusted toPEL.
What will the contrivance of the girdles avail you ?
CH.
To adorn these images with new tablets.
PEL.
Your words are riddles:
but speak plainly.
CH.
With all speed to hang ourselves from these gods.
PEL.
I have beared words that pierce my heart.
CH.
Do you understand?
for I have let you see clearly.
PEL.
And on every side matters are hard to struggle with, and a multitude of ills, like a river, comes on;
and I have entered on a deep sea of calamity not easily passed over, and no where is there an harbour from ills.
For if, indeed, I do not perform this thing for you, you have named a pollution not to be got over:
but if again stationed before the walls I shall try the event of battle with your kindred, the sons of Ægyptus, how shall not the loss be bitter, that men stain the ground with blood for the sake of women ?
But nevertheless it is necessary to dread the wrath of Jove the guardian of suppliants:
for the fear [of him] among mortals is uppermost.
Go then, aged father of these virgins, and quickly having taken in your arms these boughs, place them on the other altars of our country’s gods, that all the citizens may behold a sign of this arrival, nor let my words be blabbed:
for the people love to blame their rulers.
And perchance some com­ miseration, having seen these things, will hate the insolence of the band of youths, and the people will be more well-inclined to you:
for every one bears good will to the weaker.
DAN.
These things are much valued by us, to have obtained a pitying patron;
but send with us attendants of the citi­ zens to point out the way, that we may find the altars before the temples of the country's gods, and the seats of those who guard the city, and that there be may safety to us proceeding through the eity :
but the appearance of our form is not the same [with yours]:
for the Nile nourishes a race differens from Inachus:
we must take care lest boldness produce fear1:
and in truth one has slain a friend through ignorance.
PEL.
Go, attendants;
for the stranger says well.
Lead to the public altars and seats of the gods:
and it behoves you not to talk much with those you meet, leading this sailor who has taken refuge at the hearth of the gods.
CH.
To him you have spoken:
and he departs as he has been enjoined:
but how shall I act?
where (or, how) do you afford confidence to me ?
PEL.
Leave here, indeed.
the boughs a sign of your troubleCH.
And in truth I leave them, by your authority and words.
PEL.
Now betake yourself to this level grove.
CH.
And how can an unconsecrated grove defend me.
PEL.
By no means will we give you up to the rapine of winged birds.
CH.
But what if [you give us up] to those more hateful than hostile dragons ?
PEL.
May well-omened words be spoken by you addressed with well-omened words.
On.
By no means is it a wonder that I am impatient in mind through terror.
PEL.
The fear of kings is ever immoderate.
CH.
Do you both by words and deeds gladden my mind 2.
PEL.
But for no long time shall your father be alone:
but I assembling the people of the country, will persuade them in common, that I may render them favourable, and will instruct your father what he ought to say.
Therefore remain, and entreat with prayers the gods of the country for those things which you have desire to obtain.
But I having performed these things will return:
and may persuasion attend me and effective good fortune.
CH.
King of kings, most blest of the blest, and most perfect might of the perfect, blessed Jove, be persuaded, and may it come to pass3—avert from thy race the insolence of men, justly hating it, and plunge into the purple deep the black­ benched pest4.
Regarding the woman's side, renew the pleasing' story of the beloved woman our ancestress;
be mindful 0 you who embraced Io1, by whom we boast our­ selves to be your race, settlers from this land.
But I have returned into the ancient track, and the flowery scenes of the watehings of our mother, the herd-feeding mead, from whence
Io driven2 by the brize, flies distracted, passing through many tribes of mortals:
and twice by fate having cut through the billowy way she reaches the opposite continent.
But she hastens through the Asian land, through sheep-feeding Phrygia:
and she passes the city of Teuthras of the Mysians, and the Lydian plains, and through the Cilieian and Pam­ phylian mountains with furious haste;
and the ever-flowing rivers, and the wealthy region, and the corn-abounding land of Venus.
She arrives, driven along by the sting of the winged herdsman, at the divine all-fostering grove, the snow­ fed mead, and on which comes [with]3 the might of Typho, the water of Nile untouched by diseases, maddened by her ignominious toils, and by the stinging pains of raging Juno.
But the mortals who then were dwellers in the land, were seized in their minds by pale fear, beholding an unwonted sight, an intractable heifer mingled with a mortal, in part a heifer, and in part again a woman, and they were astonished at the prodigy.
And then who was it in truth who soothed the much-wandering wretched Io, driven by the brize ?
Jove, lord of ceaseless time ✽ ✽ but the violence [of Juno ] ceases by unwasted strength, and by divine influence, but she drops the mournful modesty of tears.
But having received the divine load, in true story, she produced her blameless son, all-happy for length of time;
whence all the earth exclaims, this is truly the offspring of life-giving Jove:
for who could have made to cease the pest inflicted by wily Juno ?
this is the work of Jove;
and saying that that race is sprung from Epaphus you will hit the truth.
Whom of the gods could I more rightly invoke than you for just deeds ?
the creative sire who by the touch of your hand became lord of Io, great all-prudent author of our race, Je wafting every needful device.
But neither subject to the of any one are you less mighty than the powerful, nor from above do you revere any inferior.
But the deed is at hand with the word1;
quickly to perform what your deep-counsel­ ling 2 mind intends.
DAN.
Have courage, my children, our affairs are well with, the natives;
perfect decrees of the people have been passed.
CH. 0 hail, old man, dearest of messengers to me;
but declare to us how the decree has been ratified, to what pur­ port the prevailing hand of the people is in the majority 8.DAN.
The decree has been passed by the Argives, not with divided opinions, but so as for me to be young again in my aged mind.
For in full assembly the air hurtled with the right hands [as the people] determined this matter;
that we should inhabit this land, free, and not as pledges, and with sanctity of place among mortals;
and that no one either of inhabitants or strangers should lead us away:
but if violence should be added, that he of the citizens who did not give his aid should be disgraced by public exile.
The king of the- Pelasgians strove to persuade, speaking concerning us a speech to this effect, declaring the great wrath of Jove, that never in after time [the god] would increase the city, and saying that if a double pollution both to from the contempt of strangers, and upon the state, should appear before the city, it would be the food of irremediable calamity.
Hearing such­ things, the Argive people passed a decree, without a crier, that these things should be:
but the citizens of the Pelasgi, heard the eloquent winning turns [of the king's speech:
] and Jove brought about a happy conclusion.
CH.
Come now, let us pour forth for the Argives good prayers, a return for good.
And may Jove, protector of strangers, regard the honours of the stranger's mouth truly blamelessly to full accomplishment.
Now, if ever, you gods sprung from Jove, hear us pouring forth prayers for desirable things for this race:
that bold Mars may never cause to be consumed by fire the Pelasgian city, who with joyless cry mois down mortals in other ploughed fields:
since they have pitied us, and have passed a favourable decree;
but they revere the suppliants of Jove, this band unenvied :
nor have they passed a decree in favour of the men, having slighted the cause of women :
reverencing the divine avenger and beholder not to be contended with, whom no house would wish to have upon its roofs in his wrath, for heavily he sits on it.
For they reverence us their kindred, the holy suppliants of Jove :
therefore they shall please the gods at pure altars.
Therefore from our mouths shaded [by boughs] let the honouring prayer fly.
Never let pestilence make empty the city of these men:
nor let [discord1] make bloody the plain of the land with corses of the natives.
And let the flower of youth be uncropt ;
nor let the paramour of Venus, man-destroying Mars mow the blossom.
And let the altars, at which are aged ministers, abound with venerable priests, and let them blaze [with offer­ ings,] that the city may be rightly ruled.
Let them reverence mighty Jove, the god of hospitality.
supreme, who by hoary law directs fate.
And we pray that other rulers of the'land be ever born, and that far-darting Diana look upon the labours of women.
Nor let any man-destroying pestilence come on, laying waste this city, averse to dance and lyre, exciting tears, producing Mars and clamours of the people.
And let the un­ joyous swarm of diseases settle at a distance from the citizens in their strength :
and let Lycian Apollo be propitious to all the youth.
And may Jove render the earth fruitful with increase at all seasons:
and may the herds that feed before [the city] in like manner bear young abundantly.
And may they receive every thing from the gods, and may the divine Muses and bards pour forth a well-omened strain:
and from holy mouths let the lyre-loving song be wafted on.
And may the people hold continually in honour their rulers;
and may a prudent sway, consulting for the common good, govern the city.
And ready to come to terms of peace, before preparing Mars, let them afford to strangers what is just without evils.
And ever let them honour their country's gods, who preside over the land.
with native laurel-bearing bull-slaying honours.
For the reverence of parents this third is written in the laws of much­ venerated Justice.
DAN.
I approve indeed of these wise prayers, oil, beloved:
but be not you afraid hearing these unexpected and new tidings from your father:
for from this suppliant-receiving mount I behold the ship:
for conspicuous it escapes not my notice, and the breasts of the sails and the side-guards1 of the vessel, and the prow in the fore part beholding with its eyes the way, too well obeying, as not being friendly to us, the directing helm.
in the hinder part of the vessel.
And the sailors may be seen conspicuous with their black limbs out of white gar­ ments :
and the other vessels and all the assistant band is conspicuous, but the leading ship, having furled her sails under the land, is rowed with oars sounding together.
But it behoves you calmly and prudently looking to the matter, not to neglect these gods.
But I will come, having taken assistants and patrons.
CH2.
For perchance!
some herald or ambassador may come, wishing to lead us away, laying hold of us as pledges.
DAN.
But none of these things shall be, fear not now.
CH.
Nevertheless it is better, if we indeed be slow in get­ ting aid4, by no means to be forgetful of this protection.
DAN.
Be of good courage;
in appointed time and day every one of mortals who despises the gods shall pay the penalty.
CH. Father, I am afraid, as the swift-winged vessels are come, and there is no length of time between.
In truth excessive fear possesses me :
[I fear] lest5 there be no advan­ tage to me of my long flight.
I perish, father, with terror.
DAN.
Since the decree of the Argives is ratified, my chil­ dren, be of good courage, they will fight for you, I am well assured.
CH.
The offspring of Ægyptus is bold and insolent, and insatiate of the fight;
and I speak to you who know it:
and possessing black wood-compacted ships they have sailed here with wrath thus far successful, together with a numerous swarthy host.
DAN.
And they shall find many who have their arms well­ hardened to toil in the meridian heat.
CH.
But leave me not alone, I beseech, father.
A forsaken woman is nothing.
Mars is not in is.
But they are wily and deceitful with impure minds, like crows, caring nought for the altars.
DAN.
These things would advantage us well, 0 my children, if they were hateful both to you and to the gods.
CH.
Not dreading these tridents and the majesty of the gods will they keep off their hands from us, father.
But they arc very haughty, maddened with impious rage, of dog-like boldness, in no respect obeying regarding the gods.
DAN.
But there is a saying that wolves are superior to dogs;
and the fruit of the papyrus surpasses not the ear of corn.
CH.
And thus it behoves us well to guard against them having the dispositions of wanton and wicked beasts.
DAN.
By no means is the management of a naval host quick, nor a station for the ships, nor a safe fastening for cables, to bring them to land, nor do the rulers of ships too quickly trust to the hold of anchors, especially when arriving at an harbourless land1.
When the sun departs3, night is wont to produce anxiety to a skilful pilot.
Thus there cannot be even a safe disembarking of the host, before the ship has been stoutly fixed in its station.
But do you take heed, not to neg­ loot the gods, on the plea of fear, procuring aid.
But the city will not blame a messenger who is old, but young in his mind prompt of speech.
On. 0 land of hills, just object of veneration, what shall we suffer?
to what part of the Apian land shall we fly, if there is any where a dark cavern?
Would I were black smoke, approaching to the clouds of Jove, and altogether invisible, and flying away without wings, might like dust be lost.
But my heart can no longer abide without flight, and my darkened spirit throbs.
But my father's look-out bos redone me :
I perish with terror.
Would I could obtain death by the twistings of the noose, before the abhorred man draw and, ere that, may Pluto rule us dying by our own hands.
From whence can I have a seat in the air on which the watery clouds become snow3, or a rock, rugged, inaccessible to goats, not pointed outo, lonely, desolate, the haunt of vultures, witnessing a deep fall to me, before, in spite of my heart, having met with forced nuptials.
And then I refuse not to become the prey of dogs, and the food of the birds of the country:
for death is free from mournful ills:
let fate approach, having seized me before the nuptial bed.
What remedy for myself delivering me from the marriage can I yet find5?
Pour forth a voice to the heavens, supplicating strains to the gods, and such as will bring about good forture to me, being the means of deliverance for meS, Father ;

For 1 do not hospitably receive the spoilers of the gods.
HER.
Having gone thou mayest tell these things to the sons ofÆgyptus1.
PEL.
This is unheeded in my thoughts.
HER.
But, that you may know, I will more plainly speak:
for it is proper that an herald declare all things clearly-how shall I say, and by whom, that I come deprived of the train of kindred women?
Mars determines not these things by witnesses, and puts an end to the strife not by the receipt of silver ;
but before that there are many slaughters of men, and trampling-down of lives.
PEL.
What does it behove you to say ?
Having at length learnt what is just, do you yourself determine, and your fellow­ voyagers.
But you may lead away these willing indeed according to the inclinations of their minds, if a lawful speech can persuade them.
But such an unanimous public decree of the state has been passed, never to give up by forcr the train of women.
Of these things the nail is firmly driven through and through, so as to remain fixed.
These things are not graven on tablets, nor sealed in the folds of books, but you hear them plain from a free-speaking tongue ;
but with all speed take yourself from my eyes.
HER.
Know this, now you will undertake a new war :
but may victory and strength be to the males.
PEL.
But you will find males inhabitants also of this land, not drinking wine made from barley.
But do you all, with your loved attendants, take courage, and go to the well-fortified city, inclosed by a deep device of towers.
And there are indeed many public abodes, but I have built with no seant hand.
It is pleasant to inhabit well-built abodes with many others;
but if it be any greater pleasure, you are at liberty to dwell also in abodes which hold but one family.
Of these choose the best and what are most pleasing.
But I will be your patron, and all the citizens, by whom this decree is now passed.
Why wait you for more powerful ones than these?
CH.
But in return for good things may you abound with good, divine king of the Pelasgians.
But benevolent sem hither our father Danaus, of good courage, prudent, and our chief adviser.
For his is the first counsel, where it behoves us to inhabit abodes, and [where is] a place not subject to envy.
Every one is ready to speak reproach against foreigners :
but may the best things befal.
PEL.
Both with fair fame, and with no wrathful rumour of the people regulate yourselves in the country, 0 friendly attendants, so as Danaus has assigned you to each [of his daughters]a servile dowry.
DAN.
0 daughters, it is fitting to pay vows to the Argives, and to sacrifice and pour libations, as to the Olympian gods, since they are our preservers with one mind.
And they have heard with indignation from me what things have been done with regard to our headstrong friends, our kindred:
but they have appointed for me these attendants and armed guards, that I might have this mark of honour, and that I might not unexpectedly perish without their knowledge by the death of the spear, and an everlasting pollution be upon this city.
I having obtained1 such things, do you observe a proper grati­ titude of mind more precious2.
And these things, indeed write down
In addition to the many other written prudent sayings of your father, so as in time to convince the unknown band3.
But every one bears a ready evil tongue against a stranger, and to speak slander is an easy thing.
But I exhort you not to disgrace me, being of a time of life which is at­ tractive to men.
And by no means is the tender mature fruit easy to guard :
but beasts and mortals harm it in somewise and winged and four-footed animals.
Venus proclaims the dropping fruits:
I affirm that rapine awaits them in whatever way they [try to] hinder if.
And on the fair-formed beauty of virgins every one that passes by sends forth a melting dart from his eye, overcome by desire.
Therefore let us not suffer those things on account of which we have had much toil, and much sea has beenϯ5 passed over in a ship, nor let us cause dis- grace to us, and pleasure to my enemies.
But even a double dwelling is offered to us, the one, Pelasgus, and the other, the city gives, to dwell apart from servants:
these things are easy.
Only observe these injunctions of your father, honouring modesty more than life.
CH.
In other things may we be fortunate from the gods, but on account of my mature age be of good courage, father :
for unless something new has been determined by the gods, I will not turn aside the former step of my mind.
Go now celebrating the blessed gods who guard the state, both those inhabiting the city, and those who dwell around the ancient wave of Erasinus.
But do you, attendants, receive the strain':
and let praise possess this city of Pelasgians, nor let us adore the mouths of Nile with hymns, but the rivers that pour through this country a willing stream, authors of increase, softening this soil of the earth with enriching weaves.
And may chaste Diana regard with pity this train :
nor through necessity let Cythercan nuptials come:
but this reward is hateful2.
But this favouring strain neglects not Venus:
for she has a power over Jove together with Juno :
and the nearest to the many-counselled goddess is honoured for her mighty works.
But loved companions are present with mother [Venus], and no passion is disobedient to soothing persuasion.
But to Harmonia is given a portion of deceiving Venus and the ways of loves.
Expeditions by sea against us fugitive, and dire woes, and bloody wars, in truth I dread beforehand.
For why have they performed a lucky voyage with swift pursuit?
SEMI-CH.
Whatever is fated, that will take place:
the great immense mind of Jove is not to be transgressed.
But perhaps with many other nuptials this event will be according to what has formerly befallen other women.
SEMI-CH. 0 mighty
Jove defend me from the nuptials of the sons of Ægyptus.
SEMI-CH.
That, indeed, would be best:
but you would soothe [a deity] not to be soothed.
SEMI-CH.
But you at least knew not the future.
SEMI-CH. Howcan
I behold the divine mind, a fathomless view ?
Pray now for moderate things.
SEMI-CH.
What moderation do you teach me?
SEMI-CH.
Not to pry into the affairs of the gods.
SEMI-CH. May royal
Jove repel the hateful hostile nuptials of the men, who delivered Io from her misery, well restrain­ ing her with healing hand, with benevolent force having founded. [our race].
SEMI-CH.
Let him afford strength also to women.
I pre­ fer the better of two evils, and partly good and partly bad2, and that justice follow justice with my prayers by liberating aid from the god.
THE END.
