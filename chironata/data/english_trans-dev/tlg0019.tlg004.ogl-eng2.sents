XANTHIAS.
The nightly watch I'm studying to relieve.
Sos.
Why then, your ribs will have a score against you.
Do you forget what sort of beast we're guarding ?
XANTH.
No, but I'd fain just drowse dull care away.
So,.
AWell try your luck :
for I too feel a sort
Of drowsy sweetness settling o'er my eyes.
‘you must owe your ribs a grudge, or you would not expose them to the thrash­ ing they will get,' or else, ' they owe you a grudge for so exposing them as we might say, ‘your ribs won't thank you for this.'
The parallel passage in Euri­ pides (Iph. in Taur, 523), where Iphigenia says of Helen, κἀμοὶ γάρ TL προὐφειλει κακὸν, ' to me too she owes an atonement;
of me too she deserves ill, is strongly in favour of the latter interpretation.
And if that Play is earlier in date than the Wasps (aud there are no good grounds for placing it later), there can be little doubt but that Aristophanes is here mimicking the Euripidean phraseology, and applying it in the same sense.
And see note on 247 infra.
Mr. Mitchell cites the passage from the Iphigenia, but his own translation.
‘ yon incur then a large and painful debt for which your ribs must pay,' is obviously incorrect;
for the dative signifies the persou to whom, not the means by which, the payment is to be made.
With the general tenor of the line compare Plautus, Miles Gloriosus, ii.
3. 22. Verum enim tu istam, si te Dii amant, temere haud tollas fabulam;
Tuis nunc cruribus capitique fraudem capitalem hinc creas.7.
καταχει̑ται.]
The idea is that, common in all languages, of the soft dews of kindly sleep.8. ἀλλ’ ἦ.]
These words invariably introduce a doubtful, hesitating question, indicative of some surprise on the part of the questioner:
'am I then really to understand that,’ ‘can it be that you are a maniae or a man possessed?’
The Corybants indulged in such wild, delirious orgies, that their name was identified throughout Hellas with madness and frenzy of every description.9. οὕκ, ἀλλά.]
This is not an absolute denial;
it is rather a qualified admission.
Not exactly so;
yet it is in truth a sleep inspired by Sabazius which possesses me.
So infra 77, οὕκ, ἀλλὰ φιλο μέν ἐστιν ἀρχὴ TOV κακου̑, and Peace, 850, OVK, ἀλλὰ κἀκει̑ ζω̑σιν ἀπὸ τοί των τινές.
Cf. Knights, 888.
To admit that he was under the influence of Sabazius was in truth to admit that his state was near akin to that of a Corybant;
for Sabazius (the Phrygian Bacchus) was the son, as the Corybants werethevotaries, of the Phrygian Cybele.
Hence Sabazius and Corybas are fre­ quently named in conjunction, as in the passages cited by Bergler from Lucian, Deorum Concilium, cap. 9, Icaromenip. cap. 27.12. Μη̑δός τις.]
With his thoughts still turned to the east, Xanthias describes the overpowering influence of the sleep to which he has succumbed, in language borrowed from the great campaigns of the Persians against Hellas.
For a somewhat similar metaphor see info 1124 and the note there.
The expres­ sion νυστακὴς ὕπνος is adopted by Alci­ phron, Epistle iii. 46, πάντας ὕπνος ὑπειλήφει νυστακτής.
Indeed the whole opening scene of the Play appears to have been an especial favourite with Alciphron;
see the notes on lines 26 and 52 infra.14.
olov οὑδεπώποτε.] Subaud. εἶδον or ἠκούσθη.
Eusebius (Hist. Eccl. x. 8, 13) speaking of the persecution under Lici-XANTH.
Sure you're a maniac or a Corybant.
Sos. (Producing a wineflask.)
Nay 'tis a sleep from great Sabazius holds me.
XANTH.
(Producing another.)
Aha !
and I'm your fellow-votary there.
My lids too felt just now the fierce assault
Of a strong Median nod-compelling sleep.
And then I dreamed a dream;
such a strange dream !
Sos.
And so did I:
the strangest e'er I heard of.
But tell yours first.
XANTH.
Methought a monstrous eagle
Came flying towards the market-place, and there Seized in its claws a wriggling brassy shield, And bore it up in triumph to the sky, And then—Cleonymus fled off and dropped it.
Sos.
Why then, Cleonymus is quite a riddle.15.
ἐδόκουν ἀετόν.]
Of the two dreams, the first is concerned with Cleonymus, the second with Cleon.
In the first, a remarkably fine eagle is seen bearing off an ἀσπὶς to the sky, when suddenly the eagle changes into Cleonymus the ἀσπιδ­ αποβλὴς, who of course at once ἀποβάλλει τὴν ἀσπίδα, vilely casts away the shield.
There is probably a play (which it is im­ possible to preserve in an English trans­ lation) on the double meaning of ἀσπὶς, a shield, and a snake, "nam aquila,” as Bergler observes,“ serpentes non clypeos rapit;
” but even before the name of Cleonymus is introduced, the meaning of ἀσπὶς has become restricted to a shield by the use of the epithet ἐπίχαλκον.16. μέγαν πάνυ.]
Cleonymus the ῤίψασπις was a man of great stature, a circumstance which rendered his coward­ ice at once wore conspicuous and more disgraceful.
Aristophanes frequently alludes to the fact.
In the Acharnians (88), the ambassadors attempt to convey some notion of the prodigious size of the bird served up for their dinner, by de­ claring that it was thrice as big as Cleonymus.
And the Cleonymus-tree which the Birds (1475) discovered in their wanderings, the tree which shed shields Instead of leaves, was a large tree with no heart, δειλὸν Kai μέγα.
And see infra 592, ὁ μέγας οὖτος Κολακώνυμος ἀσπιδαποβλής.
—Scholiast.
Riddles were the popular amusement at feasts and wine-parties.
Hence the use of the word (συμπόταις here.
And hence in the tenth book of Athe­ næus, where there is a large collection of ancient riddles, we meet with such expressions as γρίφους παρὰ πότον (x. 70),γριφεύειν Trapa πότον (x. 74), and the like.
Compare the case of Samson in the Book of Judges :
ἐποίησεν ἐκεῖ Σαμψὼν κ.τ.λ. (Judges xiv. 10—12. LXX).22. TL ταυτόν.]
Sosias is appropriating a very ancient and well-known riddle, preserved in Athenæus, x. 78 (to which Dobree also refers).
The question was Tl ταυτὸν ἐνοὐρανῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς, καὶ ἐν θαλάττῃ;
and the answer was 'a ser­ pent or other animal of which there are both land and marine specimens, and which is also a constellation in the sky.
28.
ἐστὶν μέγα.]
The first dream was a mere private satire;
it affected no great political interest.
The second dream is of high public import;
it con­ cerns the general welfare of the state and indeed bears closely upon the special purpose of the Play.
It represents the great demagogue, with his loud, cruel voice (φωνὴ μιαρὰ), addressing the as­ sembled people, whilst before him sit his devoted adherents—of whom the Heliasts formed so large a part—listen­ ing open-mouthed to his harangue, and eager to support whatever proposition he may make.30. τὴν τρόπιν.]
Possibly, as Bergler says, there may be a play on the words τὸντρόπον τοῦ πράγματος;
but more pro­ bably the expression merely means, ' let us get with all speed to the bottom of the matter.
'XANTH.
How SO ?
Sos.
A man will ask his boon companions,
What is that brute which throws away its shield Alike in air, in ocean, in the field ?XANTH.
0 what mishap awaits me, that have seen
So strange a vision !
Sos.
Take it not to heart, 'Twill be no harm, I swear it by the Gods.
XANTH.
No harm to see a man throw off his shield !
But now tell yours.
Sos.
Ah, mine's a big one, mine is ;
About the whole great vessel of the state.
XANTH.
Tell us at once the keel of the affair.
Sos.
'Twas in my earliest sleep methought I saw A flock of sheep assembled in the Pnyx, Sitting close-packed, with little clokes and staves;
addressed them is of course well known, and is frequently noticed by Aristo­ phanes, see Ach. 29, 59;
Knights, 750, 754, 783, 785;
Eccl. 94,98, etc. Plutarch (Nicias, cap. 7) relates that on one occa­ sion, when the people had taken their seats on the elevated plateau of the Pnyx (τὸν δῆμον καθήμενον ἄνω:
cf.
De­ mosthenes de Corona, 285, πᾶς ὁδῆμος ἄνω καθῆτο)
Cleon kept them waiting a long time, and at last entered hastily with a garland on his head, and said that he wanted the assembly put off till the next day, for that he was busy, had guests to entertain, and had just been sacrificing.
The people took it good­ humouredly, rose from their seats, and broke up the assembly.
The Scholiast here explains ἐκκλησιάξειν by εἰςἐκκλη­ σίαν συνάγειν, which, as Bp. Pearson (on the Creel, Art. ix.) pointed out, is an obvious error;
it means to attend an assembly.’33. βακτηρίας κ.τ.λ.]
That is to say, the sheep were clad in the ordinary garb of Athenian citizens, ἐκκληιαξόντων, at­ tending an assembly.
For the Athenians (unlike the Spartans) took their sticks with them as well as their clokes.
And therefore Praxagora in the Ecclesiazusæ, whilst dressing up the women to attend the assembly as men, is careful to see that they are all provided with sticks and clokes:
—
And shortly afterwards35.
φάλαινα πανδοκεύτρια.]
In Juvenal x. 14, " Quanto delphinis balæna Britan­ nica major," the name balæna (the Latin form of φάλαινα) is generally taken to signify a grampus;
and no doubt the epithet πανδοκεύτρια is as applicable to the grampus as to other cetaceans.
"
It is a very wolf in its constant hunger," says a recent writer, "and commits great havoc among the larger fish, such as the cod, the skate, and the halibut.
Even the smaller porpoises and dolphins fall victims to the insatiable appetite of the grampus" (Wood's Natural History, i. 544).
Nor, if we are to give credit to the concurrent testimony of ancient wit­ nesses, was the rapacity of Cleon less boundless than that of a grampus or an omnivorous cormorant (Clouds, 591).
The Knights of course is full to overflowing of imputations of this nature.
In the Acharnians (line 6) a special instance is mentioned, which is also recorded by Theopompus, 'Trapa τῶν νησιωτῶν ἔλαβε at Ach.
6. Ælian (Var. Hist. x. 17) says, λέγει Κριτίας—Κλέωνι πρὸ TOV παρελ­ θεῖν ἐπὶτὰ κοινὰ, μηδὲν νῶτ οἰκείων fAct­ θερ
ον εἶναι μετὰ be, πεντήκοντα (alii ἑκατὸν) ταλάντων TOV οἶκον ἀπέλιπε (left an estate of 50 or 100 talents).
Plutarch (Nicias, cap. 2) says that the πλεονεξία of Clean drove men over to the party of Nicias.
And in his Præcepta gerendæ Reipublicæ xiii., after relating that Cleon, when he first engaged in politics, dissolved all his private friendships, he adds, “ it had been better had he cast out of his soul his love of wealth and brawling, had he purged himself from envy and malice, for states require not the friendless and companionless, but the wise and good.
And Cleon, though he discarded his friends, yet kept a hundred flatterers to beslaver around his head."
See also the Scholiast on Lucian's Timon, 30.36.
φωνὴν ἐμπεπρημένης ὑός.]
Thevoice of a burnt (Lysistrata 322), singed or scalded sow.
This high-pitched truculent voice is everywhere put prominently forward in the Aristophanic portrait of Cleon.
In the Knights 218, when setting up a rival to Cleon, he specifies a φωνὴ μιαρὰ as the very first qualification for a successful demagogue.
In the same
Then to these sheep I heard, or seemed to hear An all-receptive grampus holding forth In tone and accents like a scalded pig.
XANTH.
Pheugh!
Sos. Eh? XANTH.
Stop, stop, don't tell us any more.
Your dream smells horribly of putrid hides.
Sos.
Then the vile grampus, scales in hand, weighed out Bits of fat beef, cut up.
XANTH.
Woe worth the day !
He means to cut our city up in bits.
Play Cleou is described as κεκράκτης, Κυκλοβόρου φωνὴν ἔχων(137, cf. Id. 286, 304, 487,1018), and his final doom (1403) is to bawl in rivalry with prostitutes and watermen.
So infra 596, lie is de­ scribed as κεκραξιδάμας, and infra 1034, and Peace, 757, as having φωνὴν χαράδρας ὄλεθρ
ον τετοκυίας.
And this loud voice accorded well with his violent and ex­ cited manner of speaking.
“ He was the first," says Plutarch (Nicias, cap. 8;
Tiberius Gracchus, cap. 2), who banished decorum from the bema, rushing to and fro while he spoke, shouting at the top of his voice (πρῶτος ἐν τῷ δημηγορεῖν ἀνακραγὼν), throwing back his cloke, and slapping his thigh."
What an inno­ vation this was upon the established mode of oratory may be judged from the statement of Æschines adv.
Timar­ chum, cap.
6. The Scholiast on Lucian's Timon, cap. 30, says of Cleon, πρῶτος δημηγορῶν ἀνέκραγεν ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματοςκαὶ ἐλοιδορήσατο.—εἰχε δὲ καὶ φωνὴν μεγάλην. Thucydides (iii. 36), calls him βιαιότατος τῶν πολιτῶν.37. αἰβοῖ.]
The double hint, from the boundless rapacity and the vociferous tones of the portent, has disclosed the secret;
and Xantliias perceives that the φάλαινα πανδοκεύτρια can be no other than ὁβυρσοπώλς ὃςἐκύκα τὴν Ὲλλάδα.
Berg­ ler refers to Knights, 892, where Demus says to Cleon, αἰβοῖ οὐκἐς κόρακας ἀπο­ φθερεῖ, βύρσης κάκιστον ὄξων;
And indeed Aristophanes is constantly alluding to Cleon's unsavoury trade.
See infra 1035, and the Knights passim.
For the ex­ pression παῦε παῦε μὴ λέγε, see Peace, 648.40.
βόειον δημόν.]
Bergler refers to Knights, 954, for a similar play on the words δημὸς, fut, and δῆμος, the people.41. δμστάναι.]
To split up, sever into parts.
The expression τὸν δῆμον διιστάναι is here commonly taken in the meta­ phorical sense of sowing discord aud division amongst the people.
And this may no doubt be its meaning.
It is however to be observed that in Knights, 818, Cleon is described as διατειχίξων (see Casaubon's note there) in contrast to Themistocles, whose long walls had blended the Piræus and Athens into one great city.
And I cannot help thinking that here too Aristophanes is alluding to some scheme of internal fortification which Clean had proposed, and which would have had the effect of splitting up the city into distinct wards, each with its own separate circumvallation.
42.
θέωρος.]
Theorus was one of the hundred flatterers (κόλακες), see infra 1033, who hung and fluttered about the more powerful demagogue.
See infra 418 and 1236.
In the present panto­ mimic vision he is represented with the head of a crow (τὴν κεφαλἠν κόρακος ἔχων) keeping close to his great patron (αὐτη̑ς πλησίον), aud indeed seated at the very foot of the Bema.44.
᾽Αλκιβάδης.]
This passage, as Brunck observes, is cited by Plutarch at the commencement of his Life of Alcibiades.
Plutarch says that the lisp of Alcibiades was very graceful and winning, and lent a singular charm and persuasiveness to his speech.45.
κόλακος.]
The happy lisp of Alci­ biades has affixed to Theorus his true designation, κόλαξ, a flatterer.
The simi­ larity of the two words κὐραξ and κόλαξ afforded a ready opening for Hellenic wit.
Brunck refers to an epigram of Palladas (Brunck's Aualecta, ii. 413), ᾽Ρω̑ καὶ λάμβδα μόνον κόρακας κολάκων διορίζει, and a maxim of Diogenes, recorded by Athe­ næus, vi. 65.
“It is far better," said Diogenes, "to go to the crows than to the flatterers, πολὺ κρι̑ττον ἐςκὀρακας ἀπελεθει̑ν ἢ ἐς κόλακας, for those indeed devour you when dead, but these while you are yet alive."
I may add Lucian's Timon, 48 (i. p. 116, ed. Bipont), where Philiades says, χαῖρε, ὦδέσποτα, καὶ τοὺς μιαροὺς τούτουςκόλακας φυλάξῃ, τοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης μόνον, TO.
ἂλλα δὲ κοράκων οὐδὲν διαΦέροντας.
Bergler thinks that a further pun is intended in the name Өέωλος quasi a θεὸς et ὄλλυμι perdo, ut ἐξώλης, etc.:
and compares the expression Өεώρου θεοισεχθρία infra 418.
Sos.
Methought beside him, on the grouud, I saw Theorus seated, with a raven's head.
Then Alcibiades lisped out to me, Gwemark !
Theocwus has a cwaven's head.
XANTH.
Well lisped !
and rightly, Alcibiades !
Sos.
But is not this ill-omened, that a man Turn to a crow?
XANTH.
Nay, excellent.
Sos.
How?
XANTH.
How !
Being a man he straight becomes a crow:
Is it not obvious to conjecture that He's going to leave us, going to the crows ?
Sos.
Shall I not pay two obols then, and hire
One who so cleverly interprets dreams ?
XANTH.
Come, let me tell the story to the audiencewhich Meineke seems to have overlooked in his Fragmenta Comicorum Græcorum.51.
ὲς κόρακας.]
The expression "going to the crows "-the equivalent of our vulgar phrase “going to the dogs,"­ supplied the material for innumerable jokes, see Peace, 117, and note there.52. δύ’ ὐβολώ.]
This seems to have been the recognized charge of theRe practitioners.
Dindorf refers to Lobeck (Aglaophonus, p. 253), who cites Lucian Deorum, Concilium, 12, θεσπιῳδεῖ 6 γεν­ ναῖος τοῖνδυοῖν ὀβολοῖν ἥνεκα, and Max.
Tyr. xix. p. 362, τῶν ἐν τοῖς κύκλοις ἀγει­ ρόντων οῖ δνοῖν ὀβλοῖν τῷ προστυχίντι ντι ἀποθεσπιζ
ουσι. Limenterus in Alciphron iii. 59 (to which Dobree also refers), is more liberal.
He dreamed that he was Ganymede clothed in princely apparel, and borne by an eagle to the gates of heaven, when lo !
a thunderbolt fell, and as they came crashing down­ wards, the eagle was no longer an eagle but a carrion vulture, and the dreamer was no longer Ganymede in gorgeous array, but himself, the parasite Limen­ terus, as naked as his mother bore him.
And he is prepared to give no less than two drachmas to any one of the tribe τῶν τοὺς ὀνείρ
ους ύποκρίνσθαι ὑπισχνου­ μένων, who will show him the interpre­ tation of the dream.54.
τὸν λόγον.]
Aristophanes uses λόγον, as Plautus argumentum, to denote not the actual plot or story which he is about to unfold, but the preliminary circumstances, a knowledge of which is requisite for the right understanding of the Play.
See Peace, 50 ;
where (as also in the Knights)
Aristophanes follows the same inartificial method, which he here employs, for putting the audience in possession of these preliminary facts.
The ὀλίγ’ ὄτθ᾽ ὑπειπὼν πρῶτον of the next line is similar to the Huie argumento antelogium quidem hoc fuit of Plautus, Menæchm.
Prologue, 13.58. κάρυα.]
The Athenians employed κάρυα as the generic name for every species of nut.
οἱ 'Αττικοὶ κοινω̂ς πάντα τὰ ἀκρόδρυα κάρυα λέγουσιν, Athenaeus, ii. 38.
Brunck observes that the practice here disclaimed (though apparently adopted in the Peace, 962) is expressly censured in the Plutus, 797, For in fact all this scrambling for bon­ bons, these stock jokes on Heracles, this Megaric buffoonery, formed part of the φόρτος, the vulgar rubbish which Aristo­ phanes had endeavoured to sweep from the Athenian stage.
See the Parabases of the Clouds, and the Peace, and the notes there.
The φορτικοὶ were tooWith just these few remarks, by way of preface.
Expect not from us something mighty grand, Nor yet some mirth purloined from Megara.
We have no brace of servants here, to scatter Nuts from their basket out among the audience, No Heracles defrauded of his supper, Nor yet Euripides besmirched again;
No, nor though Cleon shine, by fortune's favour,strong for him however.
He was un­ successful with his favourite comedy of the Clouds, ὑπ' ἀνδρω̑ν φορτικω̑ν ἡττηθεὶς, and he is now compelled to accommodate himself in some degree to the lower tastes of his audience, although his Play is still, he protests, very far supe­ rior to the ordinary φορτικὴ κωμῳδία.

ἀνασελγαινόμενος.]
This word would mean, if the passive participle, treated insolently again, and if the middle, be­ having insolently again.
The former interpretation is generally adopted ;
and having regard to the passive participle in the preceding line, and to the charac­ ter in which Euripides is portrayed as well in the Acharnians as in the later plays of Aristophanes, I think that it is undoubtedly the true one.
The Scho­ liast explains the word by κατακωμῳδού­ μενος, ὑβριζόμενος.62. Κλέων.]
At the time when the Wasps was exhibited, there was an un­ usual stir and activity in the docks and arsenals of Athens;
a great fleet was being equipped in Piræus;
a splendid army was mustering in the city.
They were bound for the coasts of Thrace;
and the commander-in-chief was to be none other than Cleon.
His success at Spliacteria had been followed by the entire defeat of the Athenian troops under their regular officers at Delium;
and now he was to be once more allowed to try his fortune in the field of battle.
And had he again returned victorious, he would no doubt have become the most considerable personage in Hellas.
The conjunction of Demagogue and General in one person had at all times been re­ garded as of evil omen to liberty;
for, as Aristotle says, ἐπὶ τω̑ν ἀρχαίων, ὄτε γένοιτο 6 αὐτὸς δημαγωγὸς καὶ στρατηγὸς, εὶς τυραν­ νίδα μετέβαλλον, Pol. v. 5.
It is to this new and brilliant exaltation of Clean that Aristophanes is in my judgment alluding in the text, and again in lines 1234, 5.
There is not the slightest ground for Reiske's notion that ' Cleon' was the original name of the Knights, and that Aristophanes is here referring to the success of his own comedy.
As to μυτ­ τωτεύσομεν see the note on Peace, 236.65.

As had been the case, he means, with the Clouds.68.

Bdelycleon is sleeping on the flat roof of the house.
Cf. Clouds, 1502;
Lysistrata, 389, 395.
And compare the ἐπὶ του̑ δώματος, on the house­ top, of the LXX. and Evangelists.
The explanation of the Scholiast, ἐπὶ ὑπερῴου, although adopted by every commentator, is unquestionably erroneous;
it is mani­ fest from 143—148 infra that Bdelycleon is actually on the roof;
and indeed the line before us admits of no other inter­ pretation.
74. 'Αμυνίας.]
Aristophanes avails himself of the opportunity to make cer­ tain of the spectators suggest the vices to which they themselves were addicted.
Amynias was a gambler, Dercylus a drunkard, Nicostratus a slave to super­ stition.
For Amynias, see the note on 1267 infra.77. φιλο.] Lucian (Piscator 20), on his trial before Philosophy, is called upon to state his name and occupation. " I am a μισαλαζὼν," he says, " and a μισο­ γόης and a μισοψευδὴς, and a μισότυφος, and in a word μισω̑ πα̑ν TO τοιουτω̑δες εἶδος τω̑ν μιαρω̑ν ἀνθρώπων." " Goodness!" says Philosophy, " what a lot of hates there are in your profession!" " That's true," says Lucian, " not but what I follow the opposite profession as well;
that I mean, which begins with φιλο (λέγω δὴ τὴν ἀπὸ του̑ φιλω̑ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔχον­ σαν);
for I am φιλαλήθης and φιλόκαλ
οςWill we to mincemeat chop the man again.
Ours is a little tale, with meaning in it, Not too refined and exquisite for you, Yet wittier far than vulgar comedy.
You see that great big man, the man asleep
Up on the roof, aloft:
well that's our master.
He keeps his father here, shut up within,
And bids us guard him that he stir not out.
For he, the father, has a strange disease, Which none of yon will know, or yet conjecture, Unless we tell:
else, if you think so, guess.
Amynias there, the son of Pronapus, Says he's a dice-lover:
but he's quite out.
Sos.
Ah,he conjectures from his own disease.
XANTH.
Nay, but the word does really end with -lover.
Then Sosias here observes to Dercylus, That 'tis a DRINK-lover.
Sos. Confound it, no :
and φιλαπλοϊκὸς, and the like."
With the expression ἀρχὴ του̑ κακου̑ compare also Eur. Troades, 982, 3,78. óδὶ Σωσίας.]
Apart from the question whether any spectator is likely to have borne the name of Sosias, there is, I think, quite sufficient to convince us that Xanthias is here mischievously put­ ting words into the mouth of his fellow- slave;
viz. (1) the identity of the name, (2) the use of the pronoun ὁδὶ, which could hardly have been intended to de­ signate another Sosias farther from the speaker;
(3) the disease mentioned, which was in fact the fellow-slave's disease, so that he too would be ἀφ' αύτου̑ τὴν νόσον τεκμαιρόμενος;
(4) the ready retort of the fellow-slave, not re­ pudiating but accepting the imputation;
ὡς μεθυστὴς, says the Scholiast, ὸ οἰκέτης ἐπαινει̑ τὴν μέθην ;
(5) the circumstance that Sosias is represented, not as guess­ ing on his own account (like Amynias and Nicostratus), but merely as prompt­ ing a spectator to make a wrong guess.
And (6) it is to be observed that in each of these jests, one spectator, and one only, is held up to ridicule;
and here we have the vice of winebibbing imputed to Dercylns.83.
μὰ τὸν κύν᾽.]
This oath is here used as the most appropriate with regard to the shameless profligacy of Philoxenus.
In later times it was known as the fami­ liar oath of Socrates;
but had it been popularly connected with that philoso­ pher at the date of the Clouds, it would assuredly have formed a feature of the Socratic portrait there.90.
ἐπὶ τοῦ πρώτου ξύλου.]
In the front row, and so nearest to the parties, the witnesses, and the advocates;
a positionThat's the disease of honest gentlemen.
MaTth.
Then next, Nicostratus of Scambon says, It is a sacrifice- or stranger-lover.
Sos.
What, like Philoxenus ?
No, by the do, Not quite so lewd, Nicostratus, as that.
XANTH.
Come, you waste words :
you'll never find it out, So all keep silence if you want to know.
I'll tell you the disease old master has.
He is a LAWCOURT-lover, no man like him.
Judging is what he dotes on, and he weeps
Unless he sit on the front bench of all.
At night he gets no sleep, no, not one grain, Or if he doze the tiniest speck, his soul Flutters in dreams around the water-clock.
So used he is to holding votes, he wakes With thumb and first two fingers closed, as one
That offers incense on a new moon's day.
If on a gate is written Lovely Demus,which, in a court consisting of several hundred members, must have been an important consideration to a dicast anxious to take an active part in the proceedings.
The expression is used in Acharnians, 25, with reference to the magistrates elbowing for the first places in the assemblies.92. ἐκεῖ.]
His mind returns in dreams to the court, and there '(in the court, ef. infra 104, 765, 770, and not in somnis nor domi, as Richtersupposes) flutters around the official water-clock, wherewith the speeches of the advocates were timed and limited.
97.
γεγραμμένον.]
Lovers seem at all times, if we can trust the poets, to have found a pleasure in writing the name of their beloved on such places as gates and walls and smooth-barked trees.
The Thracian chieftain in the Acharnians (144) is reported to be so devotedly at­ tached to the Athenians, that he spends his time in scribbling on the walls Ἀθη­ ναῖοι καλοί.
And ῎Ιδιον, says the ScholiastSo the fragment (101) is emended by Bentley and by Pierson from Aristæne­ tus, i. 10.
Bentley in his note on Calli­ machus refers to the Amores, ascribed to Lucian (cap. 16), where a crazy devotee has fallen in love with the statue of Aphrodite at Cnidus ;
and soon every wall is inscribed with her name, and every tree proclaims ‘ Beautiful Aphro­ dite,’ τοῖχος ἅπας ἐχαράσσετο, καὶ πᾶς ἐκήρυσσεν.
The practice is mentioned by Virgil, Ovid, Propertius, and others.
And English readers will remember the story of Orlando and Rosalind in Shake­ speare's

υἱὸν Πυριλάμπους Δῆμον.]
Demus, the son of Pyrilampes, was a young man of surpassing grace and beauty, and was at this time " the toast of all the town." " We two," says Socrates to Callicles, in the Gorgias of Plato, cap. 37 (to which Bergler refers), " we two are in love, each with two persons;
I with Alcibiades and Philosophy;
you with Dermis the son of Pyrilampes, and Demus the Athenian people.
And just as you mould your own opinions to suit the views of your favourites;
so must I listen to the voice of Philosophy, and form my opinions ac­ cordingly."
Cf. Id. cap. 68, and Char­ mides, cap. 6. Many passages relating to this Athenian Apollo (as his admirers called him) and his father are collected by the Commentators here and on the Gorgias;
Lysias, Orat. xix.
De Bonis Aristoph. 27;
Athenæus, is. cap. 56;
Plutarch's Pericles, cap. 13;
Brunck's Analecta, ii. 79;
Libanius pro Salt. xix. p. 500 D.
He was a man of rank and fortune;
his father had been the intimate friend of Pericles, and both father and son were renowned pea­ cock-fanciers.
We hear of Demus in after-life as a trim'arch, and receiving the present of a golden goblet as aMoaning the son of Pyrilamp, he goes And writes beside it Lovely Verdict-box.
The cock which crew from eventide, he said, Was tampered with, he knew, to call him late, Bribed by officials whose accounts were due.
Supper scarce done, he clamours for his shoes, Hurries ere daybreak to the Court, and sleeps Stuck like a limpet to the doorpost there.
So sour he is, the long condemning line
He marks for all, then homeward like a beo Laden with wax beneath his finger-nails.

κημός.]
This word, which is here employed on account of its similarity to the name of Demus, was the funnel (made of wicker or basket work) through which the dicasts dropped their votes into the verdict-box.
κημός ἐστι πλέγμα Scholiast.
ἔστι δὲ, says another Scholiast, —Scholiast.
With what follows Bergler aptly compares the passage in the Aulula­ ria of Plautus iii.
4, where the cock had been scratching about in the presence of the intruding cooks, near the spot where the crock of gold was hidden, and Euclio says, “ Credo ego edepol illi mercedem gallo pollicitos coquos, Si id palam fe­ cisset."
As to the ὑπεύθυνοι see the note on 571 infra.103.

Probably a pillar in the vestibule of the court, on which (it may be) the outside court-notices were sus­ pended.106.
τιμῶν τὴν μακράν.]
When an action had been decided against the de­ fendant, it remained for the judges to pronounce the sentence.
And in many cases, the prosecutor and the prisoner were each allowed to propose the penalty to be inflicted.
In such cases the judges declared their opinions by drawing a line on the πινάκιον τιμητικὸν, a tablet faced with wax.
Those who were in favour of the severer penalty proposed by the pro­ secutor drew a long line, those who were in favour of the lighter penalty substi­ tuted by the prisoner, drew a short line.
Philocleon's δυσκολία (see the note on 1356 infra) induced him to award in every instance the penalty demanded by the prosecution.
110.
τρέφει.]
The Scholiast says, ὡς ἐπὶ ζῴου ἔφη τὸ τρέφει, but it is hardly probable that there is any play on the words αἰγιαλὸν and αἶγα, as Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.) suggests;
nor is it probable that in the passage which he cites from Stobæus, Florilegium, 57.
4, there is any play on the words χωρίον and χοιρίον.111.
τοιαῦτ᾽ ἀλύει.]
A witty parody, as the Scholiast observes, on a passage in Euripides (Sthcnobœa, Fragm. x., Wag­ ner's Fragm. Trag. Græc.),116. μὴ φορεῖν τριβώνιον.]
We shall hereafter (1131) see with what difficulty Bdelycleon succeeds on this point, even after the successful course of treatment applied in this play to his father.119. ἐκορυβάντιζ᾽.]
Initiated him into the wild orgies of Cybele, of which the timbrel (τύμπανον) was the well-known accompaniment.
As Catullus writes, in that rapid Galliambic metre which Air.
Tennyson's Boadicea has for the first time made familiar to English ears, Niveis citata cepit—manibus leve tympanum, Tympanum, tubam, Cybelle,—tua, mater, iuitia (Atys, 8).
And again,Lest he lack votes, he keeps, to judge withal, A private pebble-beach secure within.

We guard him straitly that he stir not out.
For ill the young man brooks his sire's disease.
And first he tried by soft emollient words
To win him over, not to don the cloke
Or walk abroad :
but never a jot he yielded.
He washed and purged him then:
but never a jot.
A Corybant next he made him, but old master, Timbrel and all, into the New Court bursts
And there sits judging.
So when these rites failed, We cross the Strait, and, in Ægina, place him, To sleep the night inside Asclcpius᾽ temple :
In the Lysistrata (388) Aristophanes connects the timbrels of Cybcle with the worship of her son (see note on line 9 supra), ὁ τυμπανισμὸς χοἰ πυκνοὶ Σαβάζιοι.120.
Καινóν.]
It is impossible now to determine the names of the ten courts in which the Athenian dicasts held their sittings.
The Scholiast here recognizes four only :
εἰσὶ δὲ a, Παράβυστου, Καινὸν, Τρίγωνον, Μέσον.
The whole subject is discussed by Schömann (Appendix de Dicasteriis, Opuscula, vol. i. p. 220), Fritzsche (De Sortitione Judicum), and others, with great care, but without, as I think, any satisfactory result.
And it seems not improbable that there were never ten specifically apl ropriated courts.
but that the dicasts were from time to time accommodated in any large halls or other public buildings available and con­ venient for the purpose.
123.
Ἀσκληπιοῦ.]
Sick persons were placed to spend the night in the Temple of Æsculapius, to be recovered of their diseases.
In the Plutus the experiment is tried upon Plutus himself, with very remarkable success.
In the Curculio of Plautus, a lover hastens to visit his mistress, whilst Cappadox, into whose power she has fallen, ægrotus incubat in Æsculapii fano.
He summons the bolts to fly back and let his beloved pass through.
The serenade is a singular one, and I venture to give a translation of it:
-Bolts, bolts, I bow to you, each of you, Ask you, petition you, pray and beseech of you, Deign on a lover's entreaty to smile.
Dance, sweet bolts, all grace and activity, Dance, like jugglers in Lydian festivity, Dance, 0 dance from the staples awhile.
Dance from the staples, and send to me, send to me
Her who is draining my life-blood away.
O vile bolts, ye heed nor attend to me, None of you listens or acts as a friend to me, Stark and stiff in your places ye stay.
Their interview is terminated by the too speedy advent of the morn, and the opening of the gates of the Temple to let the patients out.
The scene of the Curculio is laid in Epidaurus, which was the headquarters of the worship of Æsculapius;
but Ægina was partly inhabited by Epidaurian colonists, and therefore naturally possessed a temple of the special Epidaurian divinity.
See Pausanias, ii. 30. 1.124. κιγκλίδι.]
The κιγκλὶς was the little gate or wicket in the low rail, δρύφακτοι, by which the space where the dicasts sat was fenced off from the rest of the Court.129.

with the dawn he stands at the Court rails !
Then, after that, we let him out no more.

And so made off:

Quick he drove pegs into the wall, and clambered Up like an old jackdaw, and so hopped out.
Now then, we compass all the house with nets, Spreading them round, and mew him safe within.

Dodwell's Tour, ii. 40.134. vai μὰ Δία.]
The actor no doubt pronounced the word Φιλοκλάων with an intonation designed to bring out dis­ tinctly the origin and meaning of the name, “Cleon-lover;
” and as the au­ dience give the expected laugh, lie sub­ joins ναὶ μὰ Δία, “ Ay by my troth it is, so you need not laugh."
τῳδὶ is used δεικτικῶς, the speaker pointing to Bdely­ cleon on the top of the house.
The names of the two chief characters, Cleon-lover, and Cleon-hater, disclose what (notwith­ standing the disclaimer in line 63 supr.) is the real scope of the comcdy before us.

Their re­ veries are interrupted by the voice of their master, calling angrily from the housetop:
ἐν ὰπειλητικῇ φωνῇ τοῦτó φησιν, says the Scholiast.
The old dicast within is growing restless as the time for the sitting of the court approaches.
Harpocration s. v. ᾽Ιπνὸς κυρίως ἡ κάμινος, νῦν δὲ τὸ μαγειρεῖóν —Scholiast.
See infra 837.
Either meaning, kitchen or furnace, will suit this passage equally well.
Philocleon may have crept into the furnace, as Falstaff in the Merry Wives of Windsor (iv. 2) is recommended to " creep into the kiluhole ;
" and whilst his son is expecting that he will slip through the τρῆμα, the hole by which the dirty water was discharged from the bath into the street (αἱ γὰρ πύελοι, says the Scholiast, τρώγλας εἶχον ἐπὶ τὴν óδὸν πρὸς τὸ τὸ ὔδωρ ἐξέρχεσθαι), the prisoner is in fact clambering up the flue which led from the furnace.
140.
μυσπολεῖται. ]
Circumvagatur, hue et illuc se versat, tanquam mus :
bustles about like a mouse.
This is, in my opinion, the genuine reading, and has been corrupted by copyists into the μυσπολεῖ τι, μυσπολεῖ τις, and the like, of the MSS.
and editions.143. ἡ κάπνη].
Philocleon in his des­ peration makes four distinct efforts to escape:
(1) through the chimney;
(2) by breaking open the front door;
(3) by the stratagem of the ass;
and (4) by spring­ ing from the roof.
All these efforts being foiled, he retires to an upper chamber and awaits in silence the ap­ proach of his associates.144.
καπνὸς ἔγωγε.]
Philocleon speaks from the chimney in a sepulchral voice.
Scurrying, mouselike, somewhere.
Mind he don't Slip through the hole for turning off the water.
And you, keep pressing at the door.
Sos.

And so Eusta­ thins (cited by Brunck) long ago observed.
ad Odyss. p. 1710.151. Καπνιου.]
Why Bdelycleon should have displayed so much disgust at the prospect of being called υἱὸς Καπνίόυ is a mystery.
There was, as the Scholiast observes, a wine so called;
a wine of Beneventum, so tart and bitter as to bring tears into the eyes.
Again, the old comedian Ecphantides (mentioned in the note on 57 supra) received the nick­ name of Καπνίας from his age and obscu­ rity;
see Hesychius s. v.
But I do not see that these suggestions afford any solution of the difficulty.
And it seems to me more probable that Καπνίας was the name of some disreputable Athenian of the day;
a name possibly quite uncon­ nected with καπνὸς, smoke;
and heuce the first syllable is long.
152.
ΣΩ. νυ̑ν τὴν θύραν ὠθεῖ.]
So I think we should read.
Whilst the at­ tention of the besiegers is diverted to the chimney, Philocleon attempts a sally through the door.
Sosias calls out;
and Bdelycleon at once descends to his assistance.
155.
ἐκτρώξεται.]
There is probably here, as Conz and Mitchell suppose, a play on the double meaning of the word βάλανος, which signifies (1) an acorn, and (2) a door-pin.
It might perhaps be translated the nul ofthe holt.

Apparently some noted culprit.

δρα̑ τι κακὸν, κακόν TL ποιη̑σαι are expressions used infra 322, 340, with reference to that dicastic vengeance which Philo­ cleon's call for his πινάκιον τιμητικὸν (cf. ad 106 supra) showed that he was even now contemplating.

In the Knights (43) Oleon is repre­ sented as a Paphlagonian slave, whom the Athenian Demus had purchased τη̑ προτέρα̨ vουμηνία̢.
In Aleiphron's Epistles (iii. 38) a master complains that a strong lusty Phrygian slave whom he had pur­ chased τη̑ ἔνη καὶ via, and had therefore named Νουμήνιυς, was turning out a dead loss (λαμπρμ̀ ζημία :
cf. Acharnians, 737), sleeping like an Epimenides, and eating like four hedgers and ditchers;
whilst in Id. iii. 61, a ruined spendthrift bewail the treatment he receives from a mere novus homo, the son (he understands) of some barbaric mother:

Dropped, let down, as an anchor, a plummet, a fishing-line.
Here it is used in the last sense, and the metaphor is continued in Bdelycleon's answer.
The Scholiast refers to the proverb (Thesni. 928) αὕτη μὲν ἡ μήρινθος οὐδὲν ἔσπασεν, and explains ταύτη by τη̑ προφάσει..179.
κάνθων. ]
Bdelycleon goes to the door, and immediately returns with the donkey.
But his father has meanwhile bethought him of the old Homeric legend, and is clinging on beneath the ass, as Odysseus clung on beneath the large and fleecy ram to escape from the blinded Cyclops.
The ass moves slowly and heavily out, like the over-weighted ram which bore the wily Ithacan.
It must be remembered that in Hellenic houses the stables were just inside the hall-door.
Vitruvius, vi. 10, sec. 50 (ed. Poleni).
184. Οὖτις. ]
This was the name which Odysseus assumed in the cave of Poly­ phemus, and which proved of essential service in assisting his escape.
The story is told in the Ninth Book of the Odyssey and in the Cyclops of Euri­ pides.189.
κλητη̑ρος. ] κλητη̑ρες οί καλου̑ντες εἰς τὸ δικαστήριον πάντας.
σημαίνει ἡ λέξις καὶ τὸν μάρτυρα.—Scholiast.
See the note on 1408 infra.
But comparing the passage before us with 1310 infra, I can­ not help suspecting that in the Athenian slang of the period, a donkey must have been sometimes styled Κλητὴρ, a caller, perhaps from its loud discordant bray.191.
περὶ ὄνου σκια̑ς.]
I. e. περὶ μηδενὸς, says the Scholiast.
For ὄνου σκιὰ was a proverbial expression, used by Sophocles, Plato, and many other writers, to denote the veriest trifle.
The well-known story from which it was derived is said (and the anecdote is repeated by a Scholiast here), to have been employed with great effect by Demosthenes before an Athe­ nian dicastery.

prisoner on a capital charge, and ob­ served that the judges were listless and inattentive.
Thereupon he said, “ Gen­ tlemen, I have an amusing tale to tell you.
A man hired an ass to take him from Athens to Megara.
The sun was so hot at noon that he got off and sat down beneath the shadow of the ass.
The driver objected.
'What, man,' cried the traveller, ' did I not hire your ass for the day ?' '
Ay truly,' replied the driver, 'to carry but not to shelter you.'
Each party insisted on his view of the bargain, neither would give way, and finally they went to law about it."
The orator ceased, but the judges clamoured to know the result ofthe dispute. " What!" said Demosthenes, rcasccnding the bema, "are ye so interested in a dispute about a donkey's shadow (ὑπὲρ ὄνου σκια̑ς), and yet in a matter of life and death (ὑπὲρ ψυχη̑ς) will not even take the trouble to listen ? "
However, to my mind the notoriety of the proverb strongly mili­ tates against the literal accuracy of the anecdote.
192. πόρρω τέχνης.]
πόρρω involves the notion of an advance forward;
and, when used with a genitive, may mean either ' far advanced in,' or' far advance from.'
It is quite possible therefore that πόρρω τέχνης might signify, as Mitchell says, far advanced in artifice.
But on the whole I agree with the Scholiast, and the general body of commentators, in taking it as equivalent to ἀτεχνω̑ς.
The expression is of course applied not to Philocleon (who is full of tricks, τεχνώμενος, supr. 176), but to his πονηρία, which is not artificial, but natural and genuine.
Οὐκ ἀπὸ τέχνης τινὸς πονηρὸς εἴ, says the Scholiast, οὐδ’ ἀπὸ μελέτης, ἀλλὰ φύσει.
Παράβολ
ος is 'desperate, reck­ less.'195. ὑπογάστριον.]
Bdelycleon had likened the old man to the foal of an ass, and called him πονηρὸς, which Philo­ clcon understands in the sense of corrupt tainted meat (λέγουσι τινὲς Kat πονηρὰ κρέα ἀντὶ του̂ σαπρά.—Scholiast), and retorts, "Wait till you taste my ὑπογάστριον."
For the stuffed paunch of an ass was accounted a delicacy at Athens.197.
Κλέων.]
So infra 409 the ξυνδι­ κασταὶ, preparing for battle, at once send for aid to Cleon, their powerful patron (ὁ κηδεμὼν, infra 242).
And so con­ versely in Knights, 255, the great dema­ gogue himself, on the first approach of danger, summons his friends and sup­ porters, the dicasts, to stand by him in the impending conflict.201.
τῇ δοκῶ προσθείς.]
τὴν δοκὸν would no doubt, as the Scholiast remarks, afford a more natural and easy construc­ tion;
but προσθεὶς seems to be used in­ transitively or with τὴν θύραν understood, making fast with the beam.
Dobree renders it, 'And putting the door to, with the beam against it, roll the great mortar to the foot of the beam.'
The μοχλὸς or bar which, since line 154, had been removed to permit the egress of the donkey, is to be replaced in its natural position across the door, and the βάλανος shot through it intο the socket behind.

Then the δοκὸς or beam (a large timber­ prop, usually called the ἀντιβάτης or Resister) is to be fixed against it;
and, finally, the great ὅλμος is to be rolled up, as a support to the δοκός.
If ὅλμον were, as it used to be considered, the accusa­ tive after προσθεὶς, we should be obliged, with Mitchell, to suppose that the speech was left unfinished, being interrupted by the sudden ejaculation of Sosias ;
but this can 'scarcely be right.202.

As they are still securing the door, Sosias is startled by something falling upon his head.

Hesychius s.v.;

Eustathius on Odyssey, ii. 337.
The Scholiast's idea that the epithet was applied to mice as well as to snakes seems to be quite groundless, and is pro­ bably derived from a faulty interpreta­ tion of the passage before us.
Conz suggests that there is a pun in the word ἡλιαστὴς, "quod sumi possit de serpente apricante," but he forgets that the sun has not yet risen.

Σκιώνην.]
Scione, on the peninsula of Pallene, was at the time closely be­ sieged by a large Athenian force.
The siege had been commenced in the pre­ ceding year ;
a wall of circumvallation had been drawn around the doomed town;
and its inhabitants were cut off from all communication with the outer world.
Yet they held out for two years;
and the summer of B.C. 421 was far ad­ vanced before they were reduced to sur­ render.
The story of this little town, its bright hopes and tragical end, is one of the saddest episodes in the pages of Thucydides.213.
ὅσον ὅσον στίλην.]
The double ὅσον here seems mainly due to the drowsiness of the speaker, though ὅσον ὅσον, in time, acquired a distinct mean­ ing of its own :
ἔτι γὰρ μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον, ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει, καὶ οὐ χρονιεῖ· ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται.—Hebrews x. 37. Ad­ huc modicum aliquantulum, qui ventu­ rus est veniet, et non tardabit :

With στίλην, ' a drop of sleep,' compare the ψακὰς ἀργυρίου of Peace, 121, and the " gutta argenti " of Plautus, Pseudolus i. 4. 4.216. ὄρθρ
ος βαθύς.]
The dim twilight that precedes the dawn.
Plato in the Protagoras reckons it as a part of the night-season,τῆς παρελθούσης νυκτὸςταυτη­ σὶ, ἔτι βαθέος ὄρθρου, 310 A.
The phrase is used again by Plato (Crito ad init.:
the two passages from Plato are cited by Mitchell);
by St. Luke (Evang. xxiv. 1);
by Theocritus (Epithalamium Helenæ, 14);
and by other writers.
Mr. Calverley, in his pleasant version of Theocritus, is misled by the ordinary meaning of βαθὺς into translating ὄρθρ
ος βαθὺς ' deep into the day.'
But the epithet βαθὺς implies that the thick dulness of night has not yet yielded to the clear transparency of day.
So when the shades of evening are closing and deepening into night it is ἑσπέρα βαθεῖα (Achilles Tatius, ii. 18;
Heliodorus, v.21);
night itself is νὺξ βαθεῖα (Plutarch de Pyth. Orac. ad init.;
Helio­ dorus, viii. 12);
and in the depth or dead of night we are it, βαθυτάτῃ νυκτί (St. Chrys. Hom. x. in Matt. 146 c).
One of the meanings attributed by Hesychius to βαθὺ is μέλαν, which may possibly refer to this very usage.

μινυρίζοντες μέλη.]
For old men, as they walked together through the streets of Athens, used frequently to chant in chorus some favourite and popular old song.
This was especially the habit of country people who chanced to be abiding in the city.
And Praxa­ gora in the Ecclesiazusæ, 277, 8, when training her female conspirators to pass off as men, instructs them to do the like:
220.
ἀρχαιομελησιδωνοφρυνιχήρατα.]
'Charming old songs from the Phœnissæ of Phrynichus.' πεποίηται ἡ λέξις παρὰ τὸ ἀρχαῖον καὶ τὸ μέλος καὶ TO Σιδὼν καὶ τὸ Φρύνιχ
ος καὶ τὸ ἐρατόν.—Scholiast.
Phry­ nichus was the favourite tragedian of the Athenian stage, until in his later years he was somewhat eclipsed by the rising splendour of Æsohylus.
His tragedies were of a lyrical character, full of dance and song.
The actor said little, but the chorus poured forth melody after melody, strung together like beads on a neck­ lace:
see Frogs, 910—915.
"Phrynichus, says the Scholiast on this place, had a mighty name for making of songs :
and in another place, He was admired, says he. for the making of songs Schol on Birds, 750];
they cry him up for the composing of tunes;
and he teas before Æschylus Schol. on Frogs, 910].
'Tis a problem of Aristotle's [Probl. xix. 13] Why did Phrynichus make more songs than any tragedian noir-a-days?
And he answers it, Was it because at that time the songs (sung by the chorus) in tragedies were many more than the verses (spoken by the actors) ?"
Bentley, Dis­ sertations on Phalaris, see. xi.
(Some of Bentley's remarks on Phrynichus have so important a bearing on the Wasps that I have given them in full at the end of the Play).
The songs of Phryni­ chits are repeatedly mentioned by Aris­ tophanes, and always in terms expressive of the warmest admiration:
cf. inf. 269 ;
Birds, 749;
Thesm.
164—6;
Frogs, 1299.
In the Birds he is likened to a bee, culling from the music of the nightin­ gale the sweets of immortal song :
a simile which, it must be confessed, is strongly in favour of reading -μελι-for -μελη- in the second limb of the com­ pound word here;
and indeed the read­ ing has much to recommend it, and is supported by very considerable authority, but it is not now found in the best Aristophanic MSS.
The Phœnissæ was probably acted about fifty-four years be­ fore the Wasps;
and was therefore first witnessed by the chorus in that fresh early youth (see note on 236 infra) when the mind is most susceptible, and the memory most retentive.
It was similar in plot to the Persæ of Æschylus (see Bp. Blomfield's preface to the latter Play), and derived its name from a chorus of Sidonian damsels, who doubtless poured forth a succession of plaintive and tender threnodies over their sailor relatives who had fallen in the battle of Salamis.
Very few fragments of the Phœnissæ remain:
the Scholiast here gives two, καὶ Σιδῶνος προλιποῦσα τὸν ναὸν, and Σιδώνιον ἄστυ λιποῦσα.
See "Wagner's Fragm.
Trag. Græc. vol. ii. p. 8, and Müller's Literature of Greece, xxi. 7.222.
τοῖς λίθοις βαλλήσομεν.]
There were plenty of stones all ready to their hand, see 199 supra.
But as to βαλλή­ σομεν, Bdelycleon reminds him that the dicasts also βάλλουσιν (inf. 227), though in a different manner.230.
ΧΟΡΟΣ.]
The actors withdraw to their original positions, and after a short pause the CHORUS make their appear­ ance.
οἱ Toil Χορ
οῦ ἀλλήλοις ἐγκελευόμενοιWherewith they call him out.
Sos.
And if they come, Had we not better pelt them with some stones ?
BDEL.
Pelt them, you rogue !
you might as well provoke
A nest of wasps as anger these old men.
Each wears beside his loins a deadly sting, Wherewith they smite, and on with yells and cries
They leap, and strike at you, like sparks of fire.
Sos.
Tut, never trouble, give me but some stones,.
I'll chase the biggest wasps-nest of them all.
CHORUS.
Step out, step out, my comrades stout:
no loitering, Comias, pound along, You're shirking now, you used, I vow, to pull as tough as leathern thong, Yet now, with ease, Charinades can walk a brisker pace than you.
Ho!
Strymodore of Conthylè, the best of all our dicast crew, Has old Euergides appeared, and Chabes too from Phlya, pray ?τὴν Πάροδον ποιοῦνται.—Scholiast.
They are dressed up to resemble Wasps, and are armed with formidable stings.
In their youth they had fought bravely for Athens, but now they are decrepit necessitous old men, earning a scanty subsistence by their dicastic pay.
The Coryphæus is mustering his troop, and exhorting them, by every argument he can suggest, to quicken their palsied footsteps.
They pick their way slowly on, their sons carrying lanterns by their side;
and everywhere the contrast be­ tween their public self-importance and domestic penury is sharply and vividly brought out.
And their entrance is made, not to the brisk trochaic move­ ment, but to a slow, halting measure, the iambic tetrameter catalectic.
In the translation, to avoid the necessity of a double rhyme.
I have added a syllable both to this metre and to the long Aristophanic lines.231.
ἱμὰς κύνειος.]
This may mean either a dog's leash, or a dog-skiu strap.
The former interpretation is adopted by Schneider (Index Græcitatis in Xen. Opusc. s. v. ἱμὰς) and Mitchell ;
the latter by the Scholiasts, Elmsley (at Ach. 724), and the Commentators generally.
And the analogy of βόειος (βοέοισιν ἱμᾶσιν, Homer's Iliad xxiii. 321), ταύρειος (of tough bull's-hide) and the like, seems to me almost conclusive in favour of the latter interpretation.
232. Χαρινάδης.]
On the names Κωμίας and Χαρινάδης see note at Peace, 1142.
Conthyle and Phlya arc two Attic demes, the former seldom, tho latter very frequently, mentioned in ancient writers.
Ἐστί που 'νταῦθα,
Is he any­ where here !236. Βυζαντίῳ.]
All the military re­ miniscences of the chorus go back to the heroic times which culminated in the victories of Cimon about half a century before.
The capture of Byzantium (Thuc. i. 94), the conquest of Naxos (infra 355, Tliuc. i. 98), and the storming of many cities of the Medes (infra 1098), all belong to those last splendid efforts of Panhellenic patriotism.
239.
τοῦ κορκόρου.]
This is thought to be the anagallis arvensis of Linnæus, our pimpernel.
The genitive is in accord­ ance with the Attic usage, of which such phrases as κατέαγα τοῦ κρανίου are perhaps the most familiar examples;
καὶ TOVTO ’Αττικὸν, says the Scholiast on Lucian's Timon, 48, αὐτοὶ γὰρ ὰεὶμέρους εἰώθασι λέγειν, " ἔφαγον τοῦ ἄρτου, ”“ ἔπιον τοῦ οἴνον.” ovrasοὖν καὶ“ κατέαγατοῦκρανίου.” Of. infra 1428.
On the succeeding words, κατασχίσαντες αὐτὸν, the Scholiast rightly observes, τὸνὅλμον δηλονότι, οὐ γὰρ TOV κόρκορον.
The ὁλμος, which here probably means the θυεία στρογγύλη (Clouds, 676), wherein bread was kneaded, was cut up by the young freebooters into σχίζαι or firewood.
These stern administrators of the law are as pleased to recount the lawless feats of their youth, as was Justice Shallow in Shakespeare's King Henry the Fourth.
See infra 354.240. ἔσται Λάχητι.]
ἢ δίκη, ἢ τιμωρία, ἢ τοιοῦτόν τι, says the Scholiast.
The mysterious vagueness of the language makes it all the more impressive.
Laches, a rude gallant soldier of the Lamachus type, had been despatched with twenty ships to Sicily, B.C. 427, nearly five years before the date of the Wasps.
The expedition was sent out in answer to the memorable embassy from Leontini, of which the sophist Gorgias had been the rhetorical spokesman (Dio­ dorus, xii. 53;
Plato, Hippias Major, 282 B), and to which Aristophanes in the Parabasis of the Acharnians (636-640) is supposed to refer (Ranke, Vit. Aristoph. §33, Thiersch);
but the commanders were instructed to take advantage of any opening which might increase the in­ fluence of Athens and tend to the ulti-All!
here it strains, the poor remains, alas !
alas !
alack the day,
Of that mad set, I mind it yet, when once we paced our nightly round, In years gone by, both you and I, along Byzantium's wall, and found And stole away the baker's tray, and sliced it up, and chopped it well, A merry blaze therewith to raise, and so we cooked our pimpernel.
On, on again, with might and main:
for Laches' turn is come to-day:
Quick, look alive, a splendid hive of wealth the fellow's got, they say.
And Cleon too, our patron true, enjoined us each betimes to bring
Of anger sore, an ample store, a good three days' provisioning :
mate subjugation of Sicily (Thuc. iii. 86).
Laches, however, effected little in this respect;
and two years later he was superseded by Pythodorus (Thuc. iii. 115):
εἰκὸς οὖν, says the Scholiast, μετα­ κληθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν κρίσιν ἧς νῦν ὁ Κωμικὸς μνημονεύει.
Such was certainly the fate of his successors, who were fined or banished for accepting bribes (Thuc. iv. 65).
And there can indeed be no doubt that Aristophanes is here alluding to a real historical incident, and that Laches was in fact accused by Cleon of peculation in his command;
his real offence being, according to our poet, that although he had made ‘a pot of money' (σίμβλον χρηάτων), he had not admitted his accuser to a share of his gains.
Compare Knights 438–140.
The charge, however, appears to have made but little impression ;
for we find Laches, soon after his recall from Sicily, and thenceforward to the end of his life, holding a high and honourable position in the Athenian Republic.
It was he who, in the spring of B.C. 423, a year before the date of the Wasps, was put forward to move the confirmation by the Assembly of the one year's truce with the Spartans (Thuc. iv. 118);
for whose military prowess he seems to have enter­ tained a profound respect (Plato, Laches, cap. 6);
and five years afterwards he fell fighting against them in the battle of Mantinea, a battle disastrous, but no way inglorious, to the Athenian arms (Thuc. v. 61, 74).
We shall have by and by, in burlesque, a full account of the trial ὁ Κλέων κατὰ, τοῦ Λάχητος, and the reader is referred to the notes there for a. further consideration of the life and character of Laches.242.
ἐν ὥρᾳ.]
Betimes.
Richter, whose work is full of the most unaccountable blunders, assigns, apparently with ap­ probation, to χθὲς the gloss ταχέως, which the Scholiast of course intended for ἐν ὥρᾳ.
The words of the Scho­ liast are ὥρα δὲ νῦν οὐχ 6 λαιρὸς, ἀλλὰ ταχέως.213.
ἡμερῶν τριῶν.]
In the ordinary proclamation which called out soldiers for active service, they were required to bring with them ‘ three days’ rations' (ἥκειν ἔχοντας σιτί' ἡμερῶν τριῶν).

See note on 3 supra.
And as to the phrase κακόν τι δράσῃ see the note on 168 supra.248.
The lights begin to grow dim.
And the metre changes from the ordinary iambic tetrameter catalectic to a com­ pound iambo-trochaic, commonly called the fourteen-syllable Euripidean metre:
The change consists merely in the ab­ straction of the first syllable of the fifth foot of the iambic tetrameter.
Thus, if in the line χώρει, πρόβαιν' ἐρρωμένως, || ὦΚωμία βραδύνεις;
we omit the ὦ, we leave the first iambic dimeter complete;
but the second is converted into a tro­ chaic dimeter brachy-catalectic, or ithy­ phallic measure, Κωμία βραδύνεις.
The Scholiast says, παîς τις προηγούμενος μετὰ τουτέστι τρεîς τροχαίους.
The metre isOn all the man's unrighteous plans a vengeance well-deserved to take.
Come, every dear and tried compeer, come, quickly come, ere morning break, And as you go, be sure you throw the light around on every side;
Lest somewhere nigh a stone may lie, and we therefrom be damnified.
BOY.
0 father, father, here's some mud !
look sharp or in you'll go.
CHOR.
Pick up a stick, and trim the wick, a better light to show.
BOY.
Nay, father, with my finger, thus, I choose to trim the lamp.
CHOR.
How dare you rout the wick about, you little wasteful scamp, And that with oil so scarce ?
but no, it don't disturb your quiet, However dear the oil may be, when I have got to buy it.
BOY.
If with your knuckles once again you 'monish us, I swear We'll douse the light, and take to flight, and leave you floundering there.
Then wading on without the lamp in darkness, I'll be bound You'll stir and splash the mud about, like snipes in marshy ground.
illustrated by Hephæstion, chap. xv.
(On compound or disjointed metres, περὶ ἀσυνατήτων) from Euripides himself, and from Callimachus,Dr. Barham, in his edition of Hephæstion, p. 227, translates the latter couplet in the same metre:
Apollo surely's in tho choir:
hark, the lyre resounding.
And there too I the Loves discern;
there too Aphrodite.
An exactly similar metre (iambic tetra­ meter changing to Euripidean) is em­ ployed in exactly similar circumstances in the Lysistrata, 254—259 and 266— 274.
The most familiar specimens of compound metres are in the Odes and Epodes of Horace, e. g. Odes, i. 4, Epodes xi. xiii;
and Bentley's notes on the former epode contain an admirable dissertation on the subject.
The MSS.
and early editions, by interpolating a small particle or other harmless mono­ syllable, have converted many of these lines into ordinary iambic tetrameters catalectic, as e. g. τὸν πηλὸν, ὦπάτερ, πάτερ, 2Y τουτονὶ φύλαξαι.
And these intruding syllables were not thoroughly weeded out until the time of Brunck.259.
ἀλλ’ οὑτοσί μοι βόρβορος.]
The state of affairs is even worse than the boy had led them to believe.
It is not mere πηλὸς, m ud, it is absolute βόρβορος, filth, on which they find themselves treading.
The ἀλλὰ points to this, and at the same time marls the transition from their dreams of public self-importance to the petty needs and discomforts of their daily life.
And there is not the slightest excuse for Hermann's strange proposal to change βόρβορος into μάρμα­ ρος, a proposal which he attempts to justify by such reasoning as this:
“ At quomodo hie senex, altero ut lutum vita­ ret monito, ἀλλὰ dicere potuit ?
quomodo, quod gravius est, si et ipse se in luto incedere sentiat, non pluisse potius quam intra quartum diem futurum esse plu­ vium dicere?”—De Chore Vesp. p. 7. Such arguments as these are really un­ deserving of serious consideration.
It is from the state of the lamps, and not from the state of the roads, that the weather prognostics are drawn ;
and the καὶ with which the succeeding verse commences shows that the impending rain will be a continuation of, and not a departure from, the present position of affairs.
260.
ἡμερῶν τεττάρων τὸπλεîστον.]
Within four days at the farthest, εἴσω ἡμερῶν τεσσάρων πάντως ὑετὸς γίνεται.- Scholiast.
To these feeble old men, painfully groping their way along the streets in the dim and uncertain twilight, the condition ofthose streets from day to day was a matter of no small importance.
A loose stone might cripple one of their number (supra 247, cf. infra 275);
a wet puddle might cause them discomfort through the whole sitting of the court.
At present their prospects in this respect are unusually gloomy.
They are already floundering in the poached filth that floods the middle street”;
and the thieves in the lamp-wicks afford a sure augury that yet more rain will fall within a very few days.
Such genitives as ἠμερῶν τετ­ τάρων are constantly used (probably with ἐντὸς understood), to signify within the space of.
Cf. Hdt. ii. 115, αὐτὸν δέ σε καὶ μετορμίζεσθαι. Soph. Elect. 478, μέτεισιν, ὧ τέκνον. οὐ μακροῦ χρόνου. Elmsley atCHOR.
All, greater men than you, my boy, 'tis often mine to beat.
But, bless me, this is filth indeed I feel beneath my feet:
Ay, and within four days from this, or sooner, it is plain, God will send down upon our town a fresh supply of rain :
So dense and thick around the wick these thieves collect and gather, And that's, as everybody knows, a sign of heavy weather.
Well, well, 'tis useful for the fruits, and all the backward trees, To have a timely fall of rain, and eke a good North breeze.
Ach. 782;
Fritzsche at Thesm.
806.
The Chorus are not, as Richter imagines, inferring from the mud that rain has fallen within the last four days;
they would have known that without the evidence supplied by the mud.
They are inferring from the cloggy wicks that rain will fall within the next four days.
The use of γοῦν in line 262 is conclusive in favour of this construction, which is in fact required by the whole tenor of the passage.262. μύκητες.]
These are the fungous excrescences which collect on the wick.
οἱ μύκητες, ἐὰνvorla ᾖ, ὕδωρ σημαίνουσι. -Theophr. de Signis Pluv. iii. Pluviæ (nuntii) in lucernis fungi.–
Pliny, N. H. xviii. 84. In the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, Book ii. (to which Florent Chretien refers), Pamphile, lucernam intuens, Quam largus imber, (licit, aderit crastino.
The Scholiast quotes from Aratus (Diosemeia, 976), who enumerates these fungi among the signs of rain:
And Florent Chretien refers to Virgil (Georgics i. 390), whose weather prognostics are almost entirely borrowed from Aratus :
Ne nocturna quidem carpentes pensa puellæ Nescivere hiemem, testa quum ardente viderent Scintillare oleum, et putres concrescere fungos.“
Nam, ut dicit Plinius, cum aer humidus esse cœperit, favilla.
quæ cum fumo solet egredi, prohibita aeris crassitate in lucernis residet, et quasdam velut fungo­ rum imitatur imagines.”
–Servius ad Virgil.
loc. cit. Similar explanations are given by the Scholiasts here and on Aratus, ubi supr.
Thomson in his Seasons (Winter) merely translates tIle lines of Virgil.265.
κἀπιπνεῦσαι βόρει
ον αὐτοîς.]
Com­ pare the language of Solomon's Song. iv. 16:
Awake, 0 north wind (ἐξεγέρθητι βορρᾶ), and come, thon south, Send thy breath through my garden (διάπνευσον κῆπόν μου)
And let my spices gush out.
But I do not know whether in this pas­ sage the north wind is (as Bp. Words­ worth supposes) invited to come, or whether, on the contrary, it is asked to make way for “the sweet south."
Βαρέας σκληρὸς ἄνεμος, ὀνόματι δὲ ἐπιδέξιος καλεῖαι is the Septuagint version of Proverbs xxvii.
16. It is certainly surprising to find that the backward fruit-trees would be benefited by a touch of ‘the North wind's breath;
’ yet it does in fact seem that in Greece the colder winds were considered not unfavourable to the growth of fruits.
In the octagonal Tower of the winds, still standing in Athens, the east wind (Apeliotes) is represented with its mantle full of fmits, pears, apples, citrons, and pomegranates (Sir G. Wheler, Journey into Greece, Book V., Bp. Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. xix.).
Yet even there Boreas is represented as coming empty-handed, " because he is," says Sir G. Wheler, “a barren wind, bringing nothing;
” and although his next neighbour (Kaikias), the north-east wind, is described by Bp. Wordsworth as presenting a plateau of olives, being the production to which its influence is favourable, yet Sir George Wheler thinks it is upsetting and de­ stroying the olives, whilst Stuart (Stuart and Revell's Antiquities of Athens) is positive that what it holds is not a dish of olives at all, but a shield full of hail­ stone.
With τῶν καρπίμων compare Peace, 1154.
But how is this ?
Our friend not here !
how comes it he's so slack ?
By Zeus, he never used to be at all a hanger-back.
He always marched before us all, on legal cares intent, And some old tune of Phrynichus he warbled as he went.
0 he's a wonder for the songs!
Come, comrades, one and all, Come stand around the house, and sing, its master forth to call.
If once he hears me tuning up, I know it won't be long Before he comes creep, creeping out, from pleasure at the song.
How is it our friend is not here to receive us ?
Why comes he not forth from his dwelling ?
Can it be that he's had the misfortune to lose
His one pair of shoes ;

By this time the chorus have arrived at Philocleon's house, and are astonished to find that he is not, as usual, at the door, ready to join their party.
On the inconsistency of this with the previous narrative of Xanthias, see the remarks in the Preface.269.
φιλῳδός
Here we have the first intimation of Philocleon's passion for the old orchestral melodies of Phrynichus, which is developed in so surprising a man­ ner in the closing scenes of the Play.
On Phrynichus see above 220, and infra 1490.273.]
The song which follows is un­ doubtedly, either in metrical arrange­ ment or in phraseology, or in both, an imitation of one of those 'sweet old songs of Phrynichus,’ wherewith the Chorus were wont to call their fellow­ labourer forth:
supra 219—221.
It is well suited for the dance, being com­ posed of the lightest and most airy measures, Ionics a minore, trochaics and dactylo-trochaics.
The strophe ends with the words λίθον ἕψεις ἔλεγεν:
the antistrophe with ὃν ὅπως ἐγχυτριεῖς.279.
Ου̃τω.]
The speaker imitates the well-known manner of the old dicast:
of. infra 688, 1169, and 1526.
The expression λίθον ἕψεις in the following line is equivalent to our vulgar phrase, " You are seeking to draw blood from a gate-post."283. τἀν Σάμῳ.]
There is no known historical event to which these words can refer, except what is called the Revolt of Samos in the year B.C. 440;
a revolt which for the moment imperilled the whole fabric of Athenian power, but ultimately left the positionofthe Imperial city more clearly recognized and more firmly established than ever.
Eighteen years had passed since then, but the memories of that critical period may well have lingered in the minds of the Athenian people.
287.

an attempt which, had it suc­ ceeded, would have given him the com­ mand of the peninsula of Pallene, and en­ abled him to deliver the people of Scione from their impending doom (Thuc. iv. 135).
The wealthy and leading inhabitants of the district, the men of substance, οἱ παχεῖς, were suspected, and not without reason, of being generally disaffected to the Athenian rule, and were conse­ quently watched with the utmost vigil- Mice, and harassed with perpetual prose­ cutions as φρονου̂ντες τὰ Βρασἰδου and προδόντες τἀπὶ θρᾁκης.
Bergler aptly compares Peace, 639, See the whole passage, and the note there.
And see also infra 475, and Knights, 262.289.
ἐγχυτριεῖς.]
The word ἐγχυτρίζειν, to put in a pot, is said to be derived from the custom of exposing infants ἐν χύτραις, and hence to mean generally to make away with, ἐγχυτριεῖς ἀντὶ του̂ φονεύσεις, ἀπὸ τῶν ἐκτιθεμένων παιδίων ἐν χύτραις.

And so Hesychius and Suidas sub voc.200.

The song ended with the word ἐγχυτριεῖς, and the Chorus are ready to proceed on their journey.
On with you, they say to the link­ boy;
we can tarry no longer. ὕπαγ’ ὦ, ὕπαγ’ ὦ, is the cry with which, in the Cyclops of Euripides, 52, the herdsmen urge on the cows towards the milking-place.291—316.]
This little dialogue, divided into a strophe and antistrophe of fourteen lines each, is introduced for the purpose of bringing out into stronger relief the res angusta domi, the narrow and needy penury of the speaker's domestic life;
and of thus showing, what indeed it was the main purpose of the Play to show, that the dicasts gained from their sup­ port of the demagogues nothing but empty words, and were left in circum­ stances of actual destitution, whilst the demagogues monopolized the real power, and honour, and wealth, the spoil and plunder of the Imperial system.
See especially infra 664—685, lines which constitute the very pith and marrow of the Play.
The prevailing metre of the present dialogue is the Ionic a minore ;
though the couplet ἀπὸyap του̂δε —δεῖ καὶ, and the corresponding couplet of the antistrophe (like the first line of the strophe and antistrophe of the μέλος which is just completed) may also be read as anapæstic dimeters, and such was probably the metre in the passage of the Theseus parodied below:

126. More commonly, however, they were used as dice, and were in that character the favourite amusement of Hellenic boys.
In Lucian's Fourth Dialogue of the Gods, Zeus, seek­ ing to reconcile Ganymede to the pro­ spect of a permanent stay in heaven, answers his natural question, " But who will play with me in heaven ?
I had plenty of playmates on Ida" (ἤν δὲ παίζεινἐπιθυμήσω, τίςσυμπαίξεταί μοι ;
ἐνγὰρ τῃ̂ "Ιδῃ πολλοὶ ικιλἡῶται ἠμεν), by saying, "You shall have Eros to play with,and lots of ὐστράγαλοι” (ἀστραγάλους μάλα πολλούς):
as being the most tempt­ ing idea he could hold out to the boy's mind.
And accordingly Apollonius Rhodius, in a pretty and well-known passage (iii. 117), represents Ganymede and Eros engaged in a game of ἀστάγα­ λοι in heaven.299. μὰ Δί’.]
The thrice-repeated μὰ At greatly enhances the simplicity of the dialogue.
In the translation such a repetition would have appeared con­ strained, and I have resorted to other modes of indicating the simplicity of the original.302.
ὄψον.]
In a note to the Pirate, chap. xi., Sir Walter Scott observes that " what is eat by way of relish to dry bread is called kitchen in Scotland, as cheese, dried fish, or the like relishing morsels."
This is exactly the meaning of the Greek word ὄψον.
In the preced­ ing line τρίτον αὐτὸνsignifies “myself and two others,” " two besides myself.

For, as Pollux observes (viii. segm. 87), ἰδία (as opposed to κοινῇ, the conjoint action of the Board of Archons) οἱ θεσμοθέται προγράφουσι πότε δεῖ δικάζειν τὰ δικαστήρια.
On the position which the Archon held in the dicastery, some remarks will be found in the Preface.308.
πόρον ‛Ελλἅς ἱερόν.]
The boy having used the word πόραν (in the sense of resource, πόρον τὸν πορισμόν φησιν, Scholiast) goes on humming some well-known words of Pindar, in which, however, πόρον means aford, “the sacred ford of Helle."
The words ‛Ελλὰς ἱερὸν arc added merely to complete the familiar quotation, and have no connexion with, but rather make nonsense of, the preced­ ing sentence.
“Positâ primâ voce πόρον pro πορισμὸν,” says Brunck, “ridiculi causâ duas insequentes addidit."
And Conz illustrates the passage by an anec­ dote of a schoolmaster who, stirring up his boys to do some noble deed, began, Aude aliquid, aud, without thinking of what he was saying, added, brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum.
So, in my translation, if we suppose the Straits of Helle to be a popular phrase, we can understand how the boy, coming to the word straits, might continue the familiar words.
How absolutely Richter mis­ understands both the meaning and the metre of the passage may be judged from his comment,“‛Ελλὰς dicit, quasi sit ‛Ελλάδος instar urbs Athenæ”!
The pas­ sage of Pindar to which Aristophanes is referring is given by the Scholiast, Παν­ δείματι μὲν ὑπὲρ πόντιον ‛Ελλὰς πόρον ἱερόν.
Boeckh, in whose collection it is Fragm.
197, says, " Pindarus loquitur de Xerxis exercitu:
is enim ingenti omnium terrore super marinum Helles fretum sacrum profectus erat."312.]
We have here a parody of one of those θρη̂νοιwhich are of so frequent occurrence in Euripides, and indeed in all the Tragedians.
The speaker imitates the wailing of the hapless children who, in the Theseus of Euripides, are selectedBOY.
Father, if the Archon say That the Court won't sit to-day, Tell me truly, father mine, Have we wherewithal to dine ?

The Scholiast says, ‛O λόγος ἐκ θησέως Εὐριπί-
The translation universally adopted of this line, ut molestias sustineam in alendo patre, is neither obtainable from the Greek, nor suitable to the context.
Far better than this is Cobet's suggestion to transfer the line to the Chorus;
a sug­ gestion which he himself repeatedly applauds, as being amongst the happiest of his Aristophanic ventures (Var. Lect. p. 67;
Novæ Lect. Preface vii, pp. 17 and 393).
“Raro in Aristophane emendando mihi videor fuisse fclicior," he says.
Yet in truth Cobet's arrangement would destroy a piece of genuine Aristophanie humour, thoroughly in accordance with the tone and spirit of the Play.
Ηαρέχειν is the strict and proper word to signify the supplying a person with food;
as infra 722, ἐθέλω παρέχειν ὅτι βούλει συι πίνειν, and 736, παρέχων χόνδρ
ον λείχειν.
Πράγματα is of course perpetually used by Aristophanes in the sense of actions, lawsuits, as infra 1392,1426.
βόσκειν is to feed, to maintain, as infra 708, 720.
Now the boy has just discovered, to his dis­ may, that his dinner depends upon the existence of a lawsuit (cf. infra 674);
and accordingly he breaks into a passion­ ate lament, " Why didst thou beur me, Mother, to give me lawsuits for food !”
In the Theseus no doubt the boy had said, " Why didst thou bear me, Mother, to give me to the Minotaur for food?" ἵνα τῷταύρῳβόσκειν παρέχης.314..
θυλάκιον.]
The dicast has brought his θύλακον, pouch or scrip, to receive his fees.
If no fees are to be forthcoming, he is carrying a mere useless ornament.
Bergler refers to Ecl. 381, where “ille qui tardius venerat in concionem nec mercedem acceperat, dicit ω̃στ' αἰσχύνομαι And Richter adds Birds, 503, ὀβολὸν άφει̑λκον, Eccl. 733, 820, and Plutus, 763.
In the Theseus the ἀνόνητον ἂγαλμα was the boy, the hope and ornament of the house, now doomed to an untimely end.
Compare Eur. Hipp. 1139, ὦ τάλαινα μα̑τερ, ἒτεκες ἀνόνατα, and the passages there collected by Bp. Monk.316.

Forπάρεστι.
The Chorus are now about to move on, when they are arrested by the pitiful accents of a well-known voice, and the sudden appa­ rition of a well-known form at an upper window of the house.317. τήκομαι.]
τήκεσθαι is to melt, pine away, like a lover.
In the Pastorals of Longus, a boy and girl, brought up together in the fields, insensibly fall in love with each other;
and Daphnis wonders at the new sensation which Chloe's kiss has given him:
έκπηδᾳ̑ μου τὀ πνευ̑μα, he says, f'fiXAcrat T) καρδἱα, θἑλω (i. 7);
while a little later we are told that Chloe herself έτήκετο (i. 11), smitten with the like love for Daphnis.
The little metrical system which follows from πἀλαι to μεγαβρύντα may be un­ scientifically described as consisting of a choriamb , with one or more sylla­ bles at the end, and generally also at the commencement, of the line.
Some­ times the lines become pure glyconics and pherecrateans, as was first pointed out by Bentley, and afterwards (but before Bentley's notes had been discovered) by Parson at Hec. 1161.

the metre is more irregular, and ermann gravely suggests that Philocleon, "quum incipit canere, præ ægritudine numeris modisque excidit," and that this is the meaning of the words ούχ οι̉ός τ'εἴμ' ἄ̜δειν.
However, there is in truth hardly any limit to the variations allowed in gly­ conics:
see Hephæstion, caps. x. and xvi., and Gaisford's notes.
The first line, Φίλοι τήκομαι μέν is a bacchiac dimeter -- I -- I which, as Dindorf observes, is employed by Euripides, Suppl. 993, Ion 190, to introduce a glyconic system.319. ἂ̜δειν.]

Turn me into smoke, or into Proxenides or Æschines, mere empty blusterers, who are nothing more than smoke.
Proxenides is styled in Birds, 1126, Προξενίδης 6 Κομπασεύς.
And the name of AEschines is again employed, infra 459, as the equivalent of smoke.
And see infra 1243—8.
Æschines was a man perpetually boasting of his pos­ sessions, though what they were, and in what part of the world they lay, nobody had ever been able to make out.
In Birds, 822, Aristophanes suggests that perhaps they may be discovered by hisadventurers in Cloud-land.
The ἀμά­ μαξυς, or tree-vine, is adopted as his em­ blem here, on account of the prodigious splutter and crackling which it makes while burning.
Εἰδος ἀμπέλου ἡ ἀμάμαξυς, says the Scholiast, η̂ν λέγουσιν άναδεν­ ψόΦον ἀποτελει̑.
The name σέλλος was applied in popular language to any needy braggart (see Scholiast on Birds, 823;
Suidas under the words Θεαγένης, σελλί­ ζειν, and σεσελλίσαι;
Hesychius under the words σεσελίσθαι and σεελλίσαι, etc.);
a usage derived by the grammarians from Sellus the father of Æschines;
but this is very doubtful:
see Meineke Corn.

And it seems at least as pro­ bable that ScUm;
is not here a real name at all, and that Αἰσχίνης ὁΣέλλου merely means Æschines, son of Brag.
And hence the description όΣέλλου is applied infra 1267 to 'Αμυνἱας OVK τω̑ν Κρωβύλου, who was really the son of Pronapus.329.
σπάδισον.]
Philocleon would fain be as one of the little ἐπανθρακίδες, so common on Athenian tables.
He wishes to be baked in the embers (for that is the meaning of σπόδισον;
see the passage of Plato cited in the note to Peace, 1131), the lightning supplying the place of the ordinary fire (καυ̑σον ὡς ἐν σποδῳ̑, Scho­ liast) ;
then to be taken up and have the dust blown off him (τω̑ν γὰρ ἀπανθρακι­ ζομένων ἰχθύων ἀποΦυσω̑σι τὴν σποδὸν, Scholiast) ;
and finally to be immersed in hot pickle (ὡς ἐπἰι̉χθύων ὀπτω̑ν ὀξάλμη ἐσ­ θιομένων, Scholiast).
In some burlesque hexameters of Cratinns (Athenæus ix. cap. 34, to which Bergler refers) the Cyclops proposes to cook Odysseus andO Sovereign, pity my woeful lot, Vouchsafe to grant me my heart's desire, Fry me in dust with a glittering, hot, Red bolt of celestial fire, Then take me up with thy hand divine, And puff me, and plunge me in scalding brine.

See the strophe of the Parabasis in the Acharnians.
Why Aristophanes should place this particular wish in the lips of Philocleon is not very clear;
but possibly it is a parody on some tragic prayer;
or again, it may contain an allusion to the vinegar qualities of the dicastic mind (see the note on 1105 infra), or to the idea expressed in the words ὂξους δίκη infra 1367.
The impressive ceremony of counting the votes is described in the Eumenides of Æschylus, and in a subsequent part of the present Play.336.

and without considering that the obnoxious nickname is really applicable, not to their adversary, but to their chief friend and patron Cleon.έγκλείει σε.–Scholiast.
They are throw­ ing out one of those wild and random accusations, of which we have other instances in the Play (one perhaps in the antistrophe itself, see the note on 378 infra), and are attributing the immure­ ment of Philocleon to an aristocratic conspiracy, because he has too faithfully and too successfully exposed the frauds of which certain trierarchs had been guilty.
See the note on Peace, 1234.—Scholiast.

σανίδες were the cause lists or notice boards of the Court;
cf. infra 848.
They were probably sus­ pended or affixed in some part of the building, along which the dicasts passed to record their votes.
Some suggest that by σανίδες we are here to understand the rails, or the benches, of the Court;
but Philocleon would hardly have used the well-known technical word in other than its well-known technical meaning.

'

Where there is no space
For receipt of a fly ;
Where the midge dares not venture Lest herself fast she lay:
If love come, he will enter And soon find out the way.353.
ὀπίαν.]
He puns on the word ὀπίας (which is really derived from ὀπὸς, and signifies a sort of cheese), as though it were derived from όπὴ, and signified a creeper through holes.
'Οπὸς was the juice of the fig-tree (see note on 145 supra), and was used to curdle or coagu­ late milk.
The cheese made by this process was styled τυρὸς ὀπίας.
Athe­ næus (xiv. cap. 76) says, Εὐριπίδης ἐν Κύκλωπι (136) ὀπίαν καλει̑ τυρὸν τὸν Dioscorides (de Materiâ Medicâ, i. 183) says, όδἐ ὀπὸς τη̑ς ἀγρίας καὶ τη̑ς ὴμέρου συκη̑ς πηκτικύς ἐστι γάλακτος. Columella, vii. 8, “ Casei quoque faciendi non erit omittenda cura;

nam requietum vel mistum celeriter acorem concipit:

quamvis possit et agrestis cardui flare conduci,—nec minus ficulneo lacte, quod emittit arbor si ejus virentem saucies corticem."
Cf. also Varro, R. R. ii. 11. Pliny (xxiii. cap. 63), " Fici succus lacteus aceti na­ turam habet:
itaque coaguli modo lac contrahit."
Lord Bacon (Nat. Hist. Century vii. 657) says. “ The milk ofYou must think, if you can, of a likelier plan :

The use of the fig-tree juice for this purpose is as old as the time of Homer, and I may cite Chap­ man's translation ofthe passage in which Pæon is described as staunching the wound of Ares (Book v. 902):
And he re-cured;
as nourishing milke, when runnet is put in, Runnes all in heapes of tougli thicke curd, though in his nature thinne.354. μέμνησαι.]
They recall to his memory an incident in one of their old campaigns under Cimon, some fifty years before (Thuc. i. 98 :
see the note on 236 supra), when Philocleon, an active and reckless young forager, laid violent hands on some roasting meat, and, throwing himself from the wall, contrived by his agility to elude all pursuit, and escape in triumph with his booty.
But πρίν ποτ’ ἦν, πρὶν ταυ̑τα, as Philocleon reminds them, and as the Chorus themselves admit, infra 1063.357.

In the subsequent words κλέψασαν and ὀβελίσκους, Philocleon is recurring to the phraseology used by the Chorus above.366.

The dawn has come at last;

With διατραγεῖν τὸδίκτυον in the next line compare supra 164.368.
Δίκτυννα.]
Artemis.
Cf. Frogs, 1339,andthe Scholiast there;
Eur. Hipp. 145,1127;
Iph. Taur. 127, and frequently elsewhere.
In Shakespeare's Love'a Labour Lost, iv.
2, Holofernes affect­ edly bestows this title on the Moon.
Apart from the play on the words Δίκ­ τυννα and δίκτυον, the goddess of hunting would naturally be averse to the destruc­ tion of hunting-tackle.
The name Dic­ tynna was in some way connected with Mt. Dicte in Crete, either as having a common derivation, or as derived the one from the other.
The old legends referred the appellation to an adventure of Britomart, who was sometimes none other than Artemis herself (see Hesy­ chius s. v. Βριτόμαρτις, which in Cretan language meant the sweet virgin.
“Cretes Dianam religiosissime venerantur, Bri­ tomartim generaliter nominantes, quod sermone nostro sonat virginem dulcem.”
—Solinus, cap. 17. βριτύ. γλυκὺ, κρη̑τες. —Hesychius);
and at other times was merely one of her attendant nymphs, according to that disintegrating process, so familiar in Greek mythology, which was perpetually severing and embodying into a distinct personality an attribute or appellation of a divine being.
In the present case the process was probably applied, because the legendary adventure was unworthy τη̑ς μεγάλης θεα̑ς ’Αρτέμιδος:
for the story went that Britomart, pur­ sued by the amorous Minos, threw her­ self from Mt. Dicte into the sea, and was only saved from drowning by some fishers' nets, δίκτυα, into which she hap­ pened to fall, and from which she thence­ forward bore the name Dictynna.
Cal­ limachus (Hymn. ad Dian.
195—199, where see Spanheim's notes) says of Britomart, And then addressing Artemis, he adds (204),CHOR.
Well but now be quickly shaping Some contrivance for escaping;

Then the best that I can think of, is to gnaw these meshes through.
May Dictynna, queen of hunters, pardon me the deed I do.
CaoR.
Spoken like a man whose efforts will salvation's goal ensue.
Ply your jaw then lustily.
The same story is found in Virgil's Ciris.
Many protested (Diodorus, v. 76) against the legend on the ground that it was compatible neither with the dignity of the goddess, nor with the reputation of Minos, and contended that the name Dietynna was bestowed upon her as the inventor of hunting-nets, εὑρέτιν γενομἐνην δικτύων τω̑ν εἰς κυνηγίαν.
Strabo (x. 4. 12) mentions another objection to the legend as recorded by Callimachus:
(I have taken away the full stop after προσαγορευθείη, for the verb clearly be­ longs to both αὔτη and τὸὄρος, and the words Δίκτη δὲ τὸ open are not a substan­ tive sentence, Dicte mons est, as the commentators on Strabo take them.)
Servius gives the name of Dicte to the nymph in his commentary on Virgo Æn. iii. 171, where for "quam minus rex amavit," we should read “quam Minos rex amavit."369.
ταυ̑τα μὲν πρὸς ἀνδρός ἐστι.]
These are the words with which Aristophanes, in the Frogs, introduces his character of the famous Theramenes.
Dionysus, travelling to the world below with the garb and symbols of Heracles, begins to suspect that he has not chosen the right means for securing a friendly reception there, and as the prospect varies between fair weather or foul, he retains for him­ self, or compels his servant to assume, the hero's club and lion-skin.
The Chorus applaud his worldly wisdom, and liken him to the shifty and versatile statesman whose sails were always trimmed to catch the prosperous breezes, from whatever quarter they might blow.
This is the part of a dexterous clever Man with his wits about him ever, One who has travelled the world to see;
Always to shift, and to keep through all Close to the sunny side of the wall;
Not like a pictured block to be, Standing always in one position;

See the note on 287 supra.
καρδίαν μὴ ἐσθίειν was one of the enigmatical maxims of Pytha­ goras, and meant ἀλυπίαν ἀσκεῖν, Athe­ næus, x. 77.
Bellerophon is described in Homey (Iliad vi. 202) as ὃν θυμὸν κατέ­ δων, πάτονἀνθρώπων ἀλεείνων, a line which Cicero (Tusc. Quæst. iii. 26) translates by " Ipse suum cor edens, hominnm vesti­ gia vitans."
“Il y rongeait son coeur," says Michelet of Charles the Bold at the siege of Neuss ;
and English writers speak of a man “eating his very heart out " with mortification.
Thomas Crom­ well told Latimer that he would make Cardinal Pole through vexation “ eat his own heart" (Lingard's England, anno 1537).
With τὸν περὶ ψυχη̑ςδρόμον Mitchell compares Hdt. is. 37, and Plato, Theætetus 172 E.offence) ὑβρίσαι τὰ μυστήρια.—Scholiast.
To profane the divine mysteries of Eleu­ sis was an act of the most daring im­ piety;
and the Chorus, who have already charged Bdelycleon with treason against the state (snpra 345), now intimate 'that they are also prepared to charge him with the most serious religious crime of which an Athenian could be guilty.
Such, I think, is the true interpretation of the passage, and the substitution of ψηφίσματα for μυστήια is quite in keep­ ing with the substitution of μισθὸν for κύλικα infra 525, and of ψη̑φον for θρῖον infra 675.

The fanatical frenzy of" the great Diopeithes," a well- known soothsayer of the period, was frequently ridiculed by contemporary writers.
The Scholiast on the Birds cites various passages, in which he is taxed with downright madness.
And the meaning of ψυχὴν ἐμπλησάμενος Διο­ πείθους (possibly an adaptation of some Tragic dimeter, ψυχὴν, ἐμπλησάμενος Πει­ θου̑ς) seems to be “ fill your soul with a fine frenzy, abandon yourself to a divine enthusiasm, reek not of fear or danger."
Bergler compares the expression καταπιὼν Εὐριπίδην in Acharnians, 484.381.
ἐσκαλαμα̑σθαι—ἀνασπαστόν.

Αύκε.]
Lycus was in some sense the patron hero of all the Athenian di­ casteries;
see infra 819.
One court-house was in immediate proximity to his chapel, and was thence called To ἐπὶ Αύκω̩ (Pol­ lux, viii. segm. 121).
The Scholiast as­ serts, and several of the old grammarians support the assertion, that the κωλακρέ­ της, in paying the dicastic fees, regularly deposited a triobol in the shrine of Lycus himself.
And Fritzsche, who cites and discusses all the passages bearing upon the relation of Lycus to the dicasteries (De Sortitione Judicum, pp. 34—40), has no doubt that such was the case.
But to me, I confess, the statement seems almost incredible, when we consider that the 'system of paying the dicasts had itself no existence before the time of Pericles.395.

The captive is almost free:

when suddenly the voice of Bdelycleou is heard, the slum­ berers awake, and all hope of escaping unperceived is at an end.398.
κατὰ τὴν ἑτέραν.]
This is usually understood, in accordance with the Latin version (which was composed by Bergler and revised by Brunck), to mean Ascende ocius in alterum fencstram ;
and I have so translated it.
But I do not suppose that θυρίδα is to be supplied;
τὴν ἑτέραν seems used in a more general sense, 'the other side;
' διὰ του̃ἑτέρου μέρους, as the Scholiast explains it.
Compare τὴν πρώτην, τὴν ταχίστην, and the like.
By φυλλάσι we are to under­ stand the εἰρεσιώνη mentioned in the following line.
399.
εἰρεσιώναις.]
Hanging above the door, as above that of Demus in theKuights (729), was an εἰρεσιώνη or harvest-wreath.
Bdelycleon orders the servant to clamber up on one side of the door, and as the old man descends by the other, to seize the εἰρεσιώνη, and beat him back with it.
It would seem, how­ ever, that on hearing the threat, Philo­ clean anticipates its execution by drop­ ping at once to the ground, though only to find himself in the clutches of his persecutors, whose attention does not appear to have been drawn as yet to the menacing attitude of the Chorus.
The εἰρεσιώνη was an olive-bough, wreathed and matted with wool, in which were stuck divers symbols of the harvest and vintage, figs, breadcakes, honey, oil, and wine.
The boughs so bedecked were carried about in the festivals of the Thargelia and Pyanepsia by boys who sang After the festival the boughs were hung up before the doors, and probably re­ mained there until the next anniversary.

Philoclcon ap­ peals to the Chorus for aid.
The word τη̃τες refers to the circumstance that the dicasts held office for a year.403.

The Chorus prepare for the struggle, not without a certain mysterious dignity of expression, calcu­ lated to strike awe into the hearts ofPHIL.

The system from εἰπέ μοι to τῳ̃-χρόνῳ (460) is repeated from ' ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ (461) to ύπηρετει̃ς (518).408.
λαβόντες.]
This is the old and genuine reading, confirmed by every MS.
The conjectural βαλόντες, which was first introduced by Brunck, and has since been retained by every editor except Richter (who grotesquely mis­ translates θαἰμάτια λαβόντες holding up your garments), is destitute of authority, and perverts the sense of the passage.
The Chorus are preparing for the fray, and they throw their upper mantles to the linkboys, just as in Thesm.
568 the woman stripping for the fight flings her garment to Philista, with the words AABE ΘΟΙΜΑΤΙΟΝ, φιλίστη, and just as Hipponax (apud Suid. s.v. Βούπαλος) says AABETE μου ΘΟΙΜΑΤΙΟΝ, κύψω Βουπύλου τὸν As regards the application to Cleon for aid see the note on 197 supra.410—414. καὶ κελεύετ’—δίκας.]
In the antistrophe (468—470) the place of these five lines is occupied by three common phonic or erotic dimeters:
It may well be that a line corresponding to καὶλεύετ’ αύτὸνή̃κειν has dropped out there;
but it is evident that in other respects the error is to be sought
In the passage before us.
The last line has already been reduced into harmony with the antistrophe by the omission of the superfluous words ώςχρή.
And it seemsprobable that the words αρδνἄ μισόπολιν ὄντακἀπολούμενον are a mere explanatory gloss which has crept into the place of some such expression as πανου̃ργον, ἄνδρ’ ἐχθρὸν, ἐπίτριπτον, or the like;
or (retain­ ing μισύπολιν with Enger, see Appendix) we might read in exact correspondence with the anti­ strophe, pæonics and cretics being inter­ changeable.
εἰσφέρειν is to propose a lair, to introduce a resolution.
416.
BA. is του̃δ’.]
The entire line is usually assigned to the Chorus;
but Dobree is, in my judgment, clearly right in transferring this latter half of it to Bdelycleon.
The words which follow, αυ̑τα δη̑τ’οὐδεινὰ κ.τ.λ. are manifestly an indignant exclamation of the Chorus, called forth by something which had immediately preceded.
And μεθήσομαι would be quite out of place on the lips of the Chorus.
Philocleon was in the hands, not of his fellow-dicasts, but of Bdelycleon and his servants.
And the appeals to release him are uniformly addressed not to the Chorus, but by the Chorus to their opponents.
It is the Chorus who say ἀφίει τὸν ἄνδρα (428), εἰ δὲ μὴ του̑τον μεθήσεις (437), and the like.
And cf. 434, 448, 452.
And nothing is more common than that ὡς, with ἴσθι, be assured that, or some such word under­ stood, should introduce a speech which contains an emphatic assertion.

ὠ̑ πόλις.]
The Chorus appeal to the Athenian people, represented, I sup­ pose, by the audience in the theatre.
They have already sent for aid to Cleon, the chief προστάτης of the populace, and they now invoke the assistance of the subordinate ποστάται, Cleon's minions and creatures, the hundred κόλακες who fluttered about him (εἴ τις προέστηκεν ὑμω̑ν κόλαξ).
Of these Theorus seems to have been one of the most conspicuous, and the most obnoxious to Aristophanes.
The expression Θεώρου θοισεχθρία is similar, as Mr. Mitchell observes, to such phrases as "Εκτορος βίη, and means merely the " God-detested Theorus."
In Clouds, 400, he is described as σφόδρ’ ἐπίορκος. See note on 42 supra.421.
ἐν δίκη.]
Not, as Richter says, δικαίως, though that is of course a very common meaning of the words ;
but " on the field of Jaw " by analogy to ἐνμάχη, “ on the field of battle;
" ἀντὶτου̑ δικάζον­ τες, as the Scholiast rightly explains it.
About“ Philip, son of Gorgias ” we have no certain information.
In Birds, 1694— 1705, Aristophanes attributes the cus­ tom of cutting out the tongue of a victim (see note on Peace, 1060) to the disgust inspired by a strange tribe of barbarians, Gorgiases and Philips, who gained their livelihood by their tongue.
The Gorgias to whom he refers was in all probability the celebrated Sophist (see Süvern, Essay on the Birds, pp. 40, 41, Hamilton's translation), who being a native of Leontini may possibly have had, or have been alleged to have, an intermixture of Sicel blood in his veins.
We have already observed (ou 240 supra) that Aristophanes is sup­ posed to be alluding in the Parabasis of the Acharnians to the rhetoric of Gor­ gias, and I think that he also refers to him in Thesin.
1103.
It may be inferred from the present passage, coupled with that in the Birds, that Philip was a rhetorician, in some way connected with Gorgias, and that he had lately fallen under the displeasure of the courts;
but whether he was an actual son, or a satellite, or (as Bergk apud Meineke, Fragm.
Com. Græe. ii. 992, suggests) merely a pupil of Gorgias, we have now no means of ascertaining.429.
χελώνας.]
The idea is further developed infra 1292, where Xanthias, smarting from Philocleon's blows, does in terms congratulate tortoises on the toughness of their shells.
These cretic couplets (which are four in number, supra 418, 9, here, and infra 475, 6 and 486, 7) indicate from time to time, in their abrupt spasmodic measure, some actual crisis in the struggle.
433.
ὠ̑Μίδα.]
Bdelycleon summons forth his other slaves to take charge of his father whilst he himself, with Xan­ thias and Sosias, goes into the house.
All three return with line 456 infra.435.
πέδαις παχεδαις.]
The same ex­ pression is used by Ctesias (apud Photium 53 11), ληφθένταδὲ πέδαις παχείαις δεθη̑ναι.
Some such word as δεθη̑ναι ought to follow here also, but Aristophanes unex­ pectedly substitutes οὐδὲν ἀριστήσετε, ye shall breakfast off nothing.436.
θρίων.]
The Scholiast says that the crackling and bouncing of fig-leaves whilst burning, had passed into a pro­ verb, πολλῶν ἐγὼ θρίων ψόφους ἀκήκοα.
He shall know the sort of wasps-nest he has dared to irritate.

CHOR.
Truly, of abundant evils, age is evermore the source :
Attic hero was appropriately invoked by the old Athenian (himself a genuine Attic autochthon, infra 1076) assailed by outer barbarians, ὑπ’ ἀνδρῶν βαρβάρων.
According to a legend preserved by Tzetzes (on Lycophron's Cassandra, 111), Cecrops, like so many other heroes of antiquity, sprang from a dragon's teeth ;
and he was popularly represented as a dragon or serpent from his waist down­ wards.
Hence his epithet Διφυὴς, which Ovid (ii. Met. 555) translates geminus, and Justin (ii. 6, 7) biformis.
He might therefore, at all events so far as his lower extremities, τὰ πρὸς ποδῶν, were concerned, be justly styled Δρακοντίδης, the name of the criminal supra 157.440.
τέτταρ’ ἐςτὴν χοίνικα.]
Large quartern loaves, four to the chœnix.
ο̃τι εἰς τὴν χοίνικα τέσσαρες μεγάλοι ἄρτοι γίνονται, μικροὶ δὲ ή.—Scholiast.
Instead of saying that he had made them bake quartern loaves, Philocleon says that lie had made them weep quartern loaves.
Perhaps, as the Scholiast observes, the saying is a proverbial one;
μήποτε καὶ τοῦτο παροιμιακόν.
ἀντὶ δὲ τοῦ εἰπεῖν πέτ­ τειν καὶδιαρτίζειν, κλάειν εἰ̃πεν.
The word χοῖνιξ was also used, as the Scholiast further remarks, to signify a sort of stocks in which offending slaves wero placed;
but if there is an allusion to any mode of servile punishment here, it would be rather to the μυλὼν, pistrinum, than to the χοῖνιξ.444.
διφθερῶν.]
The κυνέη was a dog­ skin cap;
the διφθέραι were coats of skins;
the ἐξωμὶς was a coat which left one shoulder, or both shoulders, bare:
all articles of clothing worn by the lower classes at Athens, and especially by slaves.
The ἐξωμίδες, which were the staple manufacture of Megara (Μεγαρέων οἱπλει̃στοι ἀπὸ ἐξωμιδοποιί̃αςδιατρέφονται, Xen. Mem. ii. 7, 6, see note on Peace, 1000) are described by the Scholiast here as ἱμάτια δουλικὰ καὶ ἑτερομάσχαλα, and it is doubtless to them that Aristophanes refers in the Peace by the words δούλοισι χλανισκιδίων μικρῶν.
They are worn by the Chorus of Men in the Lysistrata (662).
And in the Clouds both the κυνέη and the διφθέραι are ascribed to Strep­ siades (72, 268).
See also Eccl. 80.455.
ὀξυθύμων κ.τ.λ.]
Each epithet is accompanied by a blow.
For ὀξυθύμων see the note on 1105 infra.
In δικαίων there is probably a reference to itsOnly see how these two scoundrels hold their ancient lord perforce, Clean forgetting how, aforetime, he their daily wants supplied, Bought them little sleeveless jackets, bought them caps and coats of hide, Clean forgetting all the kindness, shown their feet in wintry weather, How from chill and cold he kept them:

While the Chorus are still in the midst of their grandiloquent menaces, Bdelycleon suddenly issues from the house, followed by Xanthias and Sosias, the former armed with a stick, the latter carrying an apparatus for smoking-out wasps.
The two slaves at once attack the Chorus.
Bdelycleon is the general­ issimo, and directs their operations.

Φιλοκλέους.]
These wasps have been nurtured, the speaker means, on the plaintive and tender lays, the honey- sweet melodies of Phrynichus;
had they fed on the acrid bitter strains ofPhilocles, you would not have disposed of them soeasily.
Philocles, described by Suidas as the nephew of Æschylus, and the father of Morsimus, was a tragic poet of the day, a man of such exceeding bitter­ ness that διὰ τὸ πικρὸν he acquired the nickname of Χολὴ, Gall.
The opinion which Aristophanes entertained of him and his plays is concisely expressed in the Thesmophoriazusæ (168), ό φιλοκλέης αἰσχρὸς αἰσχρῶς ποιεȋ.
Yet this wasp­ ish poet carried off the highest prize against the CEdipus Tyrannus of the Attic bee.465.
λάθρα γ ἐλάθαν’ ὑπιου̑σα.]
The poor must perceive, for it is self-evident now, that Tyranny with its stealthy and noiseless approach has been stealing upon them unawares.
The με which is usually added at the end of the line disturbs both the sense and the metre.466. κομηταμυνία.]
Long hair, in an Athenian who had reached the age of manhood, was considered a sign of aristocratic pride and insolence (Knights, 580;
Clouds, 545;
infra 1317;
Birds, 911;
Plutus, 572);
and was at the present time peculiarly obnoxious, as indicating a sympathy with the long-haired Spar­ tans (Birds, 1282).
No Athenian was a more grievous offender in this matter than Amynias, whose name forms the latter half of the compound before us, and who is distinguished, infra 1267, as OVK TWV Κρωβύλ

Why, as yet you've hardly entered on the parsley and the rue:
a disaffected citizen who intrigues with Brasidas (see the note on 288 supra, and on Peace, 640), and bewrays his Spartan sympathies by the fashion of his dress and his beard.
By κράσπεδα στεμμάτων we are, according to the Scholiast, to understand fringes or tassels of wool (no doubt of its natural colour), which edged the border of a Spartan cloke.
Hence in Lysistrata, 1304 (if the reading is correct), a Spartan dancer is said ὠία κου̑φα πάλλειν.476.
υ̒πήνην ἄκουρον.]
A long, nncut beard was characteristic of the Spartans, and was therefore much affected by their imitators at Athens.
Plutarch in his life of Phocion (cap. 10) tells us of an Athenian who was nicknamed Λακωνιστὴς from his imitation of Spartan habits;
τρίβωνα φορῶν ἀεὶ καὶ σκυθρωπάζων.
This man being once called up by Phocion to support some unpalatable measnre before a tumultuous audience, chose rather to court the popular applause by speaking, against his convictions, on the popular side of the question.
Thereupon Phocion, εἰπε, τί οὐ̑ν OVK ἀπεκείρω;
meaning, "why affect the austere simplicity and integrity of a Spartan, if in your heart you are after all a mere flatterer, currying the favour of the people P" The Spartan ambassadors in the Lysistrata are de­ scribed (1072) as ἒλκοντες υ̒πήνας, heavily trailing their beards along.

Parsley and rue were the common border of Hellenic gardens,as box is of our own flower-beds.
And the Chorus therefore mean, " All your troubles are to come;
you have not yet arrived at the very commencement of them.
"481. τριχοινίκων.]
The Scholiast, who interprets this word by εὐτελῶν, must look upon the phrases of the preceding line as homely metaphors, borrowed by the Chorus from their humble domestic life;
and such is the usual explanation of the passage:
but it seems on the whole more probable that they are flowers of forensic rhetoric which the Chorus have culled from the law courts, and that by τριχοινίκων ἀπῶν we are to understand ampullas et sesquipedalia verba, like ρ̒η̑μα μυριάμφορον (Peace, 521), with which Bergler compares the expres­ sion.
The Chorus appear to be giving a sample of their powers, " a short sketch of what we can do in the sublime " (if I may appropriate the heading of one of Fielding's chapters).

Everywhere about the market it is bandied to and fro:

It was eighty-eight years since the Pisistratidæ were expelled, and sixty- eight since every prospect of their resto­ ration had been extinguished by the battle of Marathon and death of Hippias.
Yet now the name of Tyrant was, in Falstaff's phrase (First Henry IV. ii. 4), ' as cheap as stinking mackarel,' ταρίχους ἀξιωτέρα.493.
ὀρφῶς.]
This is the Dusky Perch, or Dusky Serranus, a large fish of good flavour, weighing ordinarily from ten to twenty pounds, but occasionally found of very much greater weight.
It is still called orphos or rophos by the Greeks (Cuvier and Valenciennes, Hist. Nat. des Poissons, vi. 4), and is known to science as the Perca gigas of Brunnich and Gmelin, the Serranus gigas of Cuvier and Valenciennes, and the Perca robusta of Couch.
The better-known basse, which in my translation is substituted for the orphos, is a very similar fish, though belonging to a different branch of the great perch family.
Numenius (apud Ath. vii. 97) characterizes the ὀρφὸν as περιτρηχέα, an epithet clue to those rough spines which form so prominent a feature of the Percidæ, and which have earned for one of our English river-perch the distinctive appellation of the Ruffe.
The orphos is described by Aristotle (Hist. Animal., and so Athe­ naeus ubi supra) as a large carnivorous (viii. 4. 1) fish of rapid growth (v. 9. 5), firm of flesh, keeping close to the land (viii. 15. 1), and fond of getting into holes (viii. 17, 1).
It was found in the greatest perfection in the Rhodian waters (Ath. vii. 24).
ἀφύαι and μεμβράδες (otherwise βεμβάδες) are little fish of the tribe Clupeidæ, of which the herring, the pilchard, the sprat, the anchovy, and the sardine are our most familiar examples.
They are frequently men­ tioned together, as in Alciphron, iii. 53, where a knave who has stolen, amongst other things, χύτραν μεμβράδας ἔχουσανKat ἀφύας Μεγαρικὰς, describes with great zest how he sat in a corner and enjoyed the feast.
It is impossible now to dis­ criminate—probably the ancients them­ selves did not always discriminate­ with precise accuracy between the two varieties:
but it is plain that ἀφύαι, though not held in such high estimation at Athens as elsewhere (Chrysippus apud Ath. vii. 23), were a favourite and popular dish (Knights, 642—682):
where­ as from the tone in which the comic poets invariably speak of μεμβράδες we may safely conclude that they were reckoned amongst the most worthless fish in the Athenian market.
Timocles, for example (apud Ath. vi. 39), describes a needy glutton who roams round the market contemplating, and asking the prices of, the most expensive fish, though after all he can buy nothing better than μεμβράδες.
And in Alexis (ap. Ath. vii. 28) a parasite vows that he would actually rather sup off βεμβράδες with a host who could talk good Attic Greek, than undergo another banquet with a wealthy barbarian.

ὀρνίθων γάλα is the bait which in the ̋Ορνιθες, 1673, Peisthctærus appro­ priately holds out to the greedy and gullible Heracles.
Cf. Id. 733. Lucian (De Mercede Conductis, 13) says to one who after long toil has achieved the position of companion to some great ὀρνίθων γάλα.
I do not know whether our corresponding phrase, pigeon's milk, was in use before Hunter (on the Animal Economy, p. 194) discovered that pigeons do in truth nourish their young by means of a milky or curdy secretion, or whether it was introduced by the sceptics of the day in ridicule of that discovery.510. βατίσιν οὐδ’ ἐγχέλεσιν.]
Observe that Bdelycleon had mentioned neither eels nor any other fish :
but the name of Morychus would naturally suggest to Philocleon's mind a vision of those white-fleshed Copaic eels which formed the favourite dish of the great epicure.
In Acharuians, 887, a Copaic celis saluted as φίλη Μορύχω̜ :
and in Peace, 1008, the Chorus imagine themselves jostling with Morychus for the Copaic eels which are to return, with returning Peace, to the Athenian market.

The common skate is still called Raia batis.511.
πεπνιγμένον.]
πνίγειν is a term of the culinary art, and means to seethe a slain animal in its own blood and steam within a close cauldron.
In Athenæus, ix. cap. 53, one of the guests, seeing some meat served up richly steamed and sauced (συγκεκνισωμένων τινων κρεῶν ζωμῶ̜), says, " Give me some of that smothered meat (τῶν πνικτῶν Κρεαδίων δός).”
On which Ulpian retorts, " I shall myself be smothered with annoyance (αὐτὸς ἐγὼ ἀποπνιγήσομαι) if you don't tell me where you found meat so called, for I won't use the name till I know."
Thereupon the guest cites five passages from the Comedians, and amongst others the last three words of the line before us.
See also Hdt. ii. 92, and Nicander of Colophon, apud Ath. iii. 100.
Casaubon (on Athenæus, ii. 70) says, “ πνίγειν interpreter parare certo modo veteribus usitato, atque etiam hodie:
quum in proprio succo coquuntur carnes intra ollam aut patinam conclusæ sic ut nullus exhalationibus pateat meatus:
πνίγειν hoe Græci, unde πνικτὰ κρέα quæ ita sunt coctæ;
nostri item coqui paraturæ hoc genus suffocationem vocant."
The Scholiast, who seems not to have been aware that this was a real culinary operation, says, δέον εἰπεȋν Cf. Frogs, 122.
But I doubt if such an allusion was really intended.

BDEL.

PHIL.
And besides a sword supply,520.
ἥτις ἡ τιμή.]
The dispute between the parties is reduced to this issue, Do the dicasts, or do they not, obtain, any real substantial benefit from the dicastic office ?
Is that office, as Philocleon contends, a μεγάλη ἀρχἡ, or is it, indeed, the slavery which his son pronounces it ?
To show the dicasts that they were in truth mere δου̑λοι, working for the benefit of the demagogues, and not for their own advantage, was (as is more largely explained in the Preface) the great and paramount object of the Play.521.
τοὐτοισί γ̓ἐπιτρἐψαι.]
To submit the question to the arbitrement of the Chorus.
Philocleon, versed in legal terms and legal practices, at once accepts the issue proposed, and offers to refer the matters in difference to Arbitration, a method of settling disputes which is recognized in every country, and is frequently commended by the Athenian orators.
The first sentence in the first speech of Demosthenes (Demosth. adv. Aphobum) is, El μὲν ἠβούλετ' ῎ΑΦοβος, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταὶ, τὰδίκαια ποιει̑ν, ἢ περὶ ὦν διαΦερόμεθα τοι̑ς οἰκείοις ΕΠΙΤΡΕΠΕΙΝ, οὐδὲν ἂν ἔδει δικω̑ν οὐδὲ πραγμάτων (cf. infra 1392, 1426)' ἀπέχρη γὰρ ἂντοι̑ς ὑπ ἐκείνων γνωσθει̑σιν EMMENEIN (infra 524).522.
ΦΙ. καὶ ξίΦος.]
The determination to kill himself if defeated is far more consonant to Philocleon's character and circumstances than to those of Bdely­ clean;
and in fact the sword will presently (infra 714) be found in Philocleon's hand.
Philocleon might, indeed, be holding it out for Bdelycleon to fall upon its point, but the person to whom the sword is here given is plainly intended to use it against himself, and there is no trace of his having handed it over to his anta­ gonist.
I have, therefore, though with some hesitation, followed the modern editors in transferring to Philocleon the words καὶ ξίΦος . . .
τω̨̑ ξίΦει, which were formerly continued to his son.
And see the note on 714 infra.524. τὸ δει̑να.]
This, as is shown in the note on Peace, 268, is the ejaculation of a hesitating speaker, forgetting, or pretending to forget, what he was about to say.
It is used with great propriety here, since Bdelycleon, wishing to bind his father in the strictest and most technical manner, but not being so familiar as the old dicast with legal terms and phraseology, is naturally obliged to hum and haw before he can bring out the exact formula required.
That τῇ διαίτῃ ἐμμένειν, to abide by the award, is the correct legal phrase is abundantly plain from many passages of the Athenian orators.
Mitchell refers to Demosthenes adv. Bœotum, ii. p. 1011 (cap. 11), ἀναγκασθεὶς ἐμμει̑ναι̑νι
Tn διαίτῃ, and a little later in the same speech, p. 1017 (cap. 31), ἐνέμεινε τῇ διαίτῃ.
See also the passage cited in the note on 521 supra.525. μισθόν.] “ Intelligitur merces iudiciaria.

Then may I never again quaff the cup of undiluted wine to the toast of Happy Fortune, ἀκράτου οἴνου ἀγαθου̑ δαίμονος. Cf. Knights, 85.
This was the final cup before breaking up, correspond­ ing somewhat to our English toast, To our next merry meeting.
It was always a cup of pure wine unmingled with water.
See the note on Peace, 300.
But the wine-cup conveyed no idea of pleasure to Philocleon's mind;
and for κύλικα, therefore, he substitutes μισθὸν, his chief joy in life.526.

This system, from νυ̑ν δὴ 526 to κελύΦη 545, is repeated below from οὐπώποθ' 631 to πρὸς ἐμου̑ λέγοντι 647.
The antistrophical character of the two systems, obscured in the earlier editions, was first discerned by Bentley, and completely restored by Porson.
The choral portion of each system consists of fourteen choriambic dimeters.
Of these eight are acatalectic or entire dimeters, six are catalectic, having a syllable short.
In the acatalectic lines, an iambic dipody almost invariably takes the place of one choriamb:

Scholiast.530.
Φανεῖ ποῖός τις ὤν.]
The Chorus in lines 526-8 are urging Philocleon to exert all his eloquence:
" you must speak," they say, " with originality and force, that you may be shown to be, ὅπως ΦΑΝΗΣΕΙ—”
But before they can finish the sentence Bdelycleon strikes in, saying, "You shall be shown, ΦΑΝΕΙ, in your true colours, if that is what you are urging."
The Clforus, whether concluding their sentence as they had originally intended, or diverting it by way of retort to Bdelycleon's interruption, proceed “to be a speaker of a different stamp to this young man."
The words ὅπως Φανήσει μὴ κατὰ τὸν νεανίαν τόνδε λέγειν form in the result one sentence, though it is possible that but for Bdelycleon's inter­ ruption, the sentence might have had a different termination, ὅπως Φανήσει ἄρχων ἁπάντων or the like.
ποῖός τις ὢν means " such as you really are," “ in your true character," that is, a mere δου̑λος.
With the words μὴ κατὰ τὸν νεανίαν τόνδε λέγειν compare Plato's Apology, cap. 1, οὐ κατὰ τούτους εἶναι ῥήτωρ, “ an orator of a very different, that is, a far higher character."
In the Antistrophe infra 634, 5 the speech of the Chorus is cut in two by a similar interruption.535.
εἴπερ ἐθέλει κρατῆσαι.]
These words can hardly be used in a purely future signification, si victor erit, as' Bergler and Bruuck translate them.
They seem rather to mean, " if he really intends to win."
It was the resolute alacrity with which Bdelycleon accepted the challenge that portended a serious contest.545.
ἀντωμοσιω̑ν κελύΦη.]
Husks of affidavits.
In order to prevent vexatious prosecutions, Athenian law required every accuser to pledge his oath, at the outset, to the truth of the charge he was making:
whilst, on the other hand, as a security against frivolous defences, the accused was likewise required to deny the charge upon oath.
When this had been done, the parties were at issue, and evidence could be called on either side.
These preliminary affidavits were the ἀντωμοσίαι to which the speaker refers.
For all our earthly good, If he intends to conquer, Which Heaven forefend he should.

But this statement is certainly incorrect.
See the note on 1041 infra.548.
καὶ μήν.]
In the next 180 lines Aristophanes sets before us the entire process of an Athenian ARBITRATION.
The disputants have agreed to refer, ἐπιτρέπειν, the matter to arbitrators, and to abide by their award, ἐμμένειν τῇ διαίτῃ.
And now each party states his case at great length, and when both have beeu heard, the Arbitrators deliver their de­ cision in solemn form.
The proceedings commence with Philocleon's harangue in support of the proposition which he has undertaken to establish, viz., that the dicastic office is μεγάλη ἀρχὴ, that the dicast ἄρχει τω̑ν ἁπάντων, or as ho puts it here, that ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ ἡμετέρα οὐδε­ μια̑ς ἤττων ἐστὶν βασιλείας.
To prove this point, he enumerates the daily privileges and pleasures of a dicastic life, commencing with the earliest morn­ ing when he leaves his home for the Jaw-courts, and continuing until the latest evening when he has returned with his dicastic fee into the bosom of his family.
In the eager confidence with which he begins, he likens himself to a runner starting ἀπὸ βαλβίδων.

The Court-rail or bar;

It is clear that by the ἄνδρες μεγάλοι καὶ τετρα­ πήχεις who are watching there, we are to understand, with the Commentators generally, the accused officials, the ὑπεύθυνοι of 102 supra (see note on 571 infra), and not, with Florent Chretien and Reisig, the ushers of the Court.
It is one of these watchers who accosts Philocleon in the following lines.
The epithets μεγάλοι Kal τετραπήχεις seem to be rightly interpreted by Conz and others as referring rather to the social position than to the physical stature of the offenders, as in the passage cited by Bergler from Frogs, 1014, γενναί

Xenophon (or who­ ever was the author of the treatise on the Athenian Republic) must have had, one would think, these lines in his mind when he wrote the following passage, to which Bergler refers;

Χει̑ρα);
the only excuse for this piece of barbarity being the abrupt transition from the plural to the singular verb, without the introduction of a new nomi­ native case:
a very common construction in Aristophanes.
Mitchell quotes ex­ amples from Peace, 639, Eccl. 672, and Plato :
but in truth it is unnecessary to go beyond this very speech of Philocleon:
its first two sections exhibit one per­ petual interchange of the plural and singular numbers, of the class and the individual who represents the class.
"
High personages watch for me, τηρου̑σι, at the Court rails," says Philocleon (553);
" he slips, ἐμβάλλει his hand into mine (554);
they weep and pray, ἰκετεύ­ ουσιν(555), Pity me, I beseech, αἰτου̑μαι (556), though hewould, never have known, ἢδειν, of my existence but for his former acquittal."
And again, " Some bewail, ἀποκλάοναι their poverty (564), till he makes out his hardships equal, ἰσώση, to mine (565);
others jest, (σκώπτουσι (567), and if this fails he brings forward, ἀνέλκειhis children (568).
δικασταί.—Scholiast.
The interruptions of Bdelycleon divide Philocleon's speech into five distinct sections, each con­ taining a separate branch of his argu­ ment.
The first section treats of the dicast's early morning, until he entersthe Court;
the second, of the Batteries and supplications which await him there;
the third, of incidental advantages which he gains in the discharge of his judicial duties ;
the fourth, of the honours paid him by the authorities and the dema­ gogues;
and the fifth, of his evening pleasures after he has left the Court.565.
τοι̑σινἐμοι̑σιν.]ε̃ως ἀν ἀποδεξωσν ἑαυτοὺςπένητας ὡςἐγώ-Scholiast.
In the very height of his self-glorification, Philocleon makes an involuntary admis­ sion, which brings out more pointedly than any argument of Bdelycleon could have done, the contrast (on which the whole play hinges) between the public pretensions of the dicasts, and the necessitous circumstances of their daily life.
"
Who so grand as I," he says, "when great officers of state are hum.

except the Venetian:
and even there the reading is uncertain, Bekker transcribing it ἀνιὼν and Din­ dorf ἀνιω̑ν.
But ἀνιω̑ν annoying me, though adopted by several editors, is utterly inconsistent with the whole tone of Philocleon's speech.
The abasement of these ὑπεύθυνοιιs so far from being an annoyance to him, that it is his very joy and delight.

We shall have, further on, a burlesque example of this well- known expedient for exciting the pity of the Court.
See 976 infra, where Mitchell and others collect the various passagesI hear them utter all sorts of cries designed expressly to win my grace, What won't they utter, what don't they urge, to coax a Justice who tries their case ?
Some vow they are needy and friendless men, and over their poverty wail and whine, And reckon up hardships, false with true, till he makes them out to be equal to mine.
Some tell us a legend of days gone by, or a joke from Æsop witty and sage, Or jest and banter, to make me laugh, that so I may doff my terrible rage.
And if all this fails, and I stand unmoved, he leads by the hand his little ones near, He brings his girls and he brings his boys;

They huddle together with piteous bleats:
while trembling above them he prays to me, Prays as to a God his accounts to pass, to give him a quittance, and leave him free.in which the practice is mentioned by ancient writers.
Thus in the Oration against Meidias (sees. 186—188)
Demos­ thenes says, "I know that Meidias will come with tears and supplications, bring­ ing forward his children, and making himself out the most miserable of men.
I have no children to bring forward, but am I therefore to suffer wrong?
Nay but when you see him bringing forward his children, think that you see me on the other side, bringing forward the laws which he has violated, and the oaths which ye have sworn."
"If a prisoner," says Lysias (pro Polystrato, 161) "bring forward his children with wailing and weeping, ye pardon the father for the sake of the children;
children, of whom ye know not yet whether they will themselves grow up good.
citizens or bad."
In the Apology of Plato, cap. 23, Socrates is represented as saying to his judges, " It may be that some amongst you are vexed and indignant, because I do not, as others do, bring forward my children in the court, and seek to win your favour and move your pity by unmanly and ignoble supplications."
That is a course, he says, which no Athenian (above all, no Athenian philosopher) should adopt to save himself from any penalty which he may righteously have deserved, though it be the extreme penalty of death;
and judges too, he adds, should be swayed not by motives of pity and favour, but by the truth and justice of the case.569.
ἐγὼ δ' ἀκροω̑μαι.]
He dwells with pleasure on the word ἀκροω̑μαι.
which is repeated from 562 supra.
"I am the man to listen to these cajoleries which testify to our power and to the reverence and estimation in which we are held."
ὑπὲρ αὐτω̑ν in the next line may mean either for their sakes or standing over them;
the former interpretation is the more probable of the two.571.

All Athenian officials at the close of their term of office were compelled to render an account.
These accounts were first laid before the public auditors, who invited all persons to come in and make their objections.
If no serious objection was made, the accountswere passed, and the official discharged.
If, however, any difficulty arose, the matter was submitted to the dicasteries, and with them the ultimate decision rested.
The subject is treated at some length by Æschines at the commence­ ment of his speech against Ctesiphon, who had proposed that Demosthenes, before he had passed his audit and obtained his discharge, should receive a crown of gold for his services.
AEschines denounces this proposal as an attempt ἒρχεται ψη̑φον (p. 56o official, he says, can escape this obligation:

Every Athenian, on attaining the age of manhood, had his name entered in the register, τὸ ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματει̑ο, of his deme, and was thenceforth entitled to the full privileges of an Athenian citizen.
In ordinary cases this registration took place at the age of twenty years :
bnt it seems probable that orphan heirs (such as Demosthenes:
see the speeches against Aphobus and Onetor) were allowed to be registered at an earlier period, if on a personal examination, δοιμαμασία, they were able to satisfy the judges that they had already arrived at their full physical strength and maturity.

Œagrus was a popular actor of the day.
Whether the tragedy which furnished his favourite character was the Niobe of Æschylus, or the Niobe of Sophocles, we have now no means of deciding.
The latter was probably the more recent Play of the two :
but, on the other hand, Aristophanes frequently (Birds,1247 ;
Frogs, 912—20,1392) refers to, or quotes from, the Niobe of Æschylus, and nowhere, unless in the present passage, makes any allusion to the Niobe of Sophocles.
Richter says "propter verba τὴν καλλίστην ἀπολέξας Sophoclem subauditum esse dixerim," but of course καλλίστην refers not to the Play, but to the ρ̒η̑σις;
nor indeed (were it otherwise) have we the slightest ground for supposing that the Niobe of Sophocles was, in the estimation of Aristophanes, or in fact, superior to the Niobe of Æschylus.
See Wagner, Trag. Græc Fragm. vol. i. pp. 73, 335.

The φορβειὰ was a sort of leathern muzzle fitting closely round the piper's month on each side of the pipe.
It was intended to make the breath flow more evenly through the instrument, and so to produce a sweeter and more melodious tone.
The Scholiast says, (φορβειαί εἰσιτἀδέρματατὰπερὶ τὰ στόματατω̑ναὐλητω̑ν πρ

Bergler refers to Birds, 861, where a crow comes on as a piper ἐμπεφοβιωμένος, with a mouth-band on;
and Florent Chretien to Cicero (Epist. ad Att. ii. 16), who says, " Cnæus quidem noster jam plane quid cogitet nescio, Sophoclis Inc. fab. fragmenta, 100, Wagner.
The ἒξοδοςwas the accom­ paniment which the pipers played as the Chorus were finally leaving the stage at the end of the Play :
it was the exit-, as the Parodos was the entrance- piece.

ὲπίκλρον.]
There seems every reason to believe that an Athenian citizen was legally competent to dispose by will of the hand and fortune of his heiress-daughter:
and Aristophanes must, therefore, I imagine, be here refer­ ring to some recent case in which the Courts had, on too light grounds, super­ seded a father's testamentary dispositions, and awarded the heiress and her property to some favoured claimant, who probably came forward as her nearest of lin.
And this will account for the tone of Bdelycleon's rejoinder, and his use of the word ἀδικει̑ς in reference to the transaction in question.
584.

With the like humor­ ous application to inanimate things of phraseology appropriate to human beings alone, Plautus (Mostellaria, i. 3. 108) makes a lover say, Hei mihi misero, savium speculo dedit!
Nimis velim lapidem, qui ego illi speculo diminuam caput.
By Heaven, slie kissed the mirror!
I'll break that mirror's head if it don't mind.

τῇκόγχῃ.]
κόγχαι were little cases or capsules which Athenian law-station­ ers placed over seals to preserve them from damage and defacement.
TheAnd what if a father by will to a friend his daughter and heiress bequeath and bestow, We care not a rap for the Will, or the cap which is there on the seal so grand and sedate, We bid them begone, and be hanged, and ourselves take charge of the girl and her worthy estate ;
And we give her away to whoever we choose, to whoever may chance to persuade us:
yet we, Whilst other officials must pass an account, alone from control and accounting are free.
BD.
Ay that, and that only, of all you have said, I own is a privilege lucky and rare, But uncapping the seal of the heiress's will seems rather a shabby and doubtful affair.

And if ever the Council or People have got a knotty and difficult case to decide,Ravenna Scholiast says, ὠs kαχγόκ ἐπιτι θέντωνται̑ς σφραγι̑ν, ἀσφαλείας ἒνεκα.
And the Venetian adds, κόγχῃ δὲ τῷ Philocleon means that the most careful observance of legal forms and solemnities does not oust the paramount authority of the dicasteries.
587.
ἀνυπεύθυνοι.]
The Heliasts were, as is shown in the Preface, the Sovereign People sitting in their judicial capacity.
To them all officials were responsible:
see the note on 571 supra.
And they themselves were not, and could not be, responsible to any one.
588.
σε μόνον.
This is the admirable emendation of Reiske and Porson for σεμνόν.
Both the σε and the μόνον are necessary to the sense, whilst σεμνὸν was here manifestly out of place.
Of all the pleasures and privileges on which Philocleon has descanted, there is but one whereon Bdelycleon is prepared to congratulate him.
It is, no doubt, a piece of good fortune, he admits, that the dicasts have not to answer for their conduct:
especially (he seems to imply) if they act in the manner which his father has described with regard to the heiress's marriage.

This word.

but is here, of course, used with reference to the κόγχη mentioned above.590 ή βουλή χὠ δη̑μος.]
It was by no means uncommon for the βουλή or the εκκλησίαto send a case for trial before the Hcliæa.
There were naturally many offences, ἂγραΦα ἀδικήματα, which had been overlooked in the written code, and to which, therefore, no punishment was by law annexed.
In such cases it was necessary to appeal to the Senate or the Assembly by means of an εἰσαγγελία (πςὸς τὴν βουλὴν ἢ πρὸς τὸν δη̑μον ἡ πρώτη κατάστσις ἂστω, Harpocration s. v. εισ­ αγγελία.
)
And the Senate or the As­ sembly would in some cases themselves decide the question :
in others, direct it to be tried, subject to special regulations, before the ordinary tribunals.
There were other cases, too, in which a com­ plainant was required to apply to the Assembly for leave to institute proceed­ ings against a public offender.
Such, for example, seems to have been the rulewhere the complaint was against the conduct of a magistrate in his official capacity.
In these cases the preliminary proceeding was termed a προβλή.592.
Κολακώνυμος.]
Under this guise the bulky person (see note on 16 supra) of Cleonymus is again brought forward.
Evathlus, Cleonymus, and Theorus (and possibly Euphemius also) were all minor demagogues, the satellites and κόλακες of Cleon.
And so, like Theorus in the dream supra 42, Cleonymus is here (though in another fashion) repre­ seNted as τὴν κεφαὴν κόλακος ἔχων.
Evathlus, who was probably the well- known scholar of Protagoras, is described by Aristophanes in the Holcades as a πονηρὸς συνήγρος?
and with this the notice in Acharnians, 710, would seem to agree.
And we may perhaps conclude from the present passage that Cleonymus figured in the same character.593. ἡμα̑ς.]
This reading is supported by every authority, the MSS., the Scholiast, the early editions;
and is positively demanded by the context.
ὑμα̑ς, which crept into Kuster's text apparently by an error of the printer, and which is retained by all recent editors, is altogether inconsistent with the tenor of Philocleon's argument.
"We are recognized," he says, "as the Sovereign Power in the state:
the Senate and the Assembly send us cases, which they are unable to determine:
the orators and advocates vow that they will protect its from wrong:
none can succeed in the Assembly except by our vote and influence:
Cleon himself, the common assailant of all else, comes forward as our staunch friend and patron;
whilst his satellites descend to the lowest and most servile offices to curry favour with us."
Modern editors seem to imagine that πλήθους in the second limb of the sentence requires ὑμα̑ς in the first:
forgetting that the Heliasts considered themselves, and in fact were, the πλῆθος, the δῆμος, the Athenian People.
In the orators the expression τὸὑμέτερον πλῆθος is fre­ quently applied to the dicastic body, as in Lysias adv.
Agoratum, passim.
And so supra 267.
And see the following note.594.
ἐν τῳ̑ δήμῳ.]
For the HeliastsThey pass a decree for the culprits to go to the able and popular Courts to be tried:
Evathlus, and He !
the loser of shields, the fawning, the great Cowardonymus say "
They'll always be fighting away for the mob," " the people of Athens they'll never betray."
And none in the People a measure can pass, unless he propose that the Courts shall be free, Dismissed and discharged for the rest of the day when once we have settled a single decree.
Yea,
Cleon the Bawler and Brawler himself, at us, and us only, to nibble forbears, And sweeps off the flies that annoy us, and still with a vigilant hand for our dignity cares.
You never have shown such attention as this, or displayed such a zeal in your father's affairs.
Yet Theorus, a statesman as noble and grand as lordly Euphemius, runs at our callwould naturally form so very large a proportion of the ordinary Athenian Assembly that their united votes could determine the fate of any measure brought forward there.
It was this which makes Aristophanes so anxious, in the present Play, to detach them from their alliance with the demagogues:
and it was for the same reason that the demagogues were so anxious to maintain and strengthen that alliance.
It seems that one method of earning the gratitude and securing the votes of the dicasts was to get them released after one cause was heard, and to give them a full day's pay for a short day's service.
In a graphic passage of the Knights (50-60), to which Bergler refers, this form of bribery is directly attributed to Cleon.
He is there depicted as a Paphlagoniam slave, who ingratiates himself with the Demus, his master, at the expense of his fellow- servants:
and wins the old man's favour by saying, (Observe that it is the Demus itself which is here represented as sitting in the dicasteries.)
And a little farther on we are told, βυρσίνην for μυρσίνην, ῥήτορας for μυίας, as infra 597.597.
μυίας ἀπαμύνει.]
This was no light matter in Eastern countries.
The Eleanshadtheir Zεὺς ἀπόμυιος (Pansanias v. 14. 2), or μυίαγος (Pliny, x. 40):
the Philistines (probably) their Baal-zebub or God of Flies.
And see the preceding note.
And on the epithet κεκραξιδάμας.
see the note on 36 supra.599.
Εὐφημίου.]
Of Euphemius we know nothing, except what the Scholiast informs us, τῶν ἄγαν ἐπὶ κολακεία διαβαλλομένων ἐστίν.
It is plain that whoever and whatever be may have been, he was re 'arde 1 by Aristophanes as a still more despicable character than Theorus, who is obviously intended to be insulted by the comparison,600.
σπόγγον—τἀμβάδια.]
This was the most menial of offices:
a circum­ stance which gave point to the sarcasm of Stratonicus, who, seeing a dandy proud of his well-sponged shoes, condoled with him on the reverses which must have befallenhim;
"for," said Stratonicus, " I am sure that you would never have had your shoes so well sponged if you had not done them yourself," οὐκἃν οὕτως ἐσπογγίσθαι καλῶς, εἰ μὴ αὐτὸς ἐσπόγγισεν.
-Athenæus, vii.
43.604. πρωκτὸς λουτροῦ περιγιγνόμενος.]
This passage has been misunderstood by Florent Chretien here, and Jens on Hesychius (who both take λουτρὸν in the sense of latrina, by Brunck, who connects τῆς ἀρχῆς with παύσει, and by other com­ mentators.
Philocleon is waxing jubilant at the success of his own oratory.
"
These are my triumphs," he says;
"this is what you were going to show (ἀποδείξειν) to be mere slavery and service!" " Go ou," responds Bdelycleon, " talk your fill:
sooner or later you will come to an end (παύσει, soil. λέων):
and then I shall show you (ἀναφανήσει, you will be proved, see the note on 530 supra) in respect of all this vaunted empire to be a mere πρωκτὸς λουτρ
οῦπεριγνόμενος."
A πρωκτὸς which gets the better of its bath, which defeats all efforts to cleanse it, may be said to gain a victory indeed, but a victory which it were better to lose than to gain.
And Philocleou's triumphs, it is implied, are triumphs which bring him no benefit whatever, but turn to his own disadvan­ tage.
This is the meaning attributed with more or less precision to the proverb πρωκτὸς λουτμοῦ περιγιγνὸενος. by theAnd whips out a sponge from his bottle, and stoops, to black and to polish the shoes of us all.
Such, such is the glory, the joy, the renown, from which you desire to retain and withhold me, And THIS you will show, this Empire of mine, to be bondage and slavery merely, you told me.

But the nicest and pleasantest part of it all is this, which I'd wholly forgotten to say, 'Tis when with my fee in my wallet I come, returning home at the close of the day, 0 then what a welcome I get for its sake;
my daughter, the darling, is foremost of all, And she washes my feet and anoints them with care, and above them she stoops, and a kiss lets fall, Till at last by the pretty Papas of her tongue she angles withal my three-obol away.
Then my dear little wife, she sets on the board nice manchets of bread in a tempting array, And cosily taking a seat by my side, with loving entreaty constrains me to feed;

οὖ ᾽πελελήσμην.]
It would seem that Philocleon had intended lines 601, 602 to be the peroration of his speech:
but he remembers that his even­ ing enjoyments have not yet been men­ tioned, and he sets out afresh with the words before us.610.

So the MSS.
read, and rightly. "
These are my plea­ sures," says Philocleon:
" the barley-cake, the old-fashioned stoup of wine which await my return from the Courts are' to me more dear, congenial to my heart,'than all the proffered luxuries of your fashion­ able establishment.
Never be it my fate to depend upon you and your pantler."614. ἀλλ' ἤν.]
This is Elmsley's felicitous emendation (at CEd. Tyr. 662) for the old reading ἄλλην.
If your pantler grudge me a meal, here is sufficient for my wants ;

It is probably to be con­ sidered as a relic of Philocleon's old campaigning days, a circumstance which would give additional meaning to the epithet στράτιον below.621.
ἀκούω.]
Men speak of the thunders of the Court as they speak of the thunders of Zeus:
they use the same language about us that they use about Him :
we strike as much awe into the hearts of men as does He, the King of the Gods.
It is in reference to this final vaunt that Bdelycleon opens'his speech, infra 652, by addressing Philocleon as " Father Zeus."622. θορυβήσωμεν.]

A Greek or Roman when alarmed by a thunderstorm was accustomed to make with his lips a clucking or popping noise.
This was called a poppy sma (a name formed to imitate the sound), and was considered as an inarticulate deprecation, or charm to avert the danger.
It seems that this superstitious habit was very prevalent in the ancient world:
"fulgetras," says Pliny (xxviii. 5, cited by Bergler), 'poppysmis adorarc consensus gentium est."631.
οὐπώποθ'.]
In the strophe, supra 526—545, the Chorus had expressed great anxiety, and even Philocleon had spoken in a faltering tone, as regarded the probable issue of the contest.
The antistrophe, 631—647, breathes quite another spirit:
there is no faltering now:
all anxiety is lost in the triumph of the Chorus at the success of their champion.
634.
ἐρήμας τρυγήσειν.]
This pro­ verbial expression is also found, asBentley observes, in Ecclesiazusæ, 885.
Bdelycleon must have expected, the speaker means, to find me unprepared for the struggle:
since well he knew that I have in reality by far the better case.
The γὰρ in line 635 is intended to show not why Bdelycleon expected to find the grapes undefended, but why Philocleon is sure that he must have expected it.
For an exactly similar construction see 1 Cor. x. 5.639.
δικάζειν.] δέον εἰπεῖν οἰκεῖν,δικάζειν δὲ ἔφασαν ώς φιλόδικοι.—Scholiast.
In the Menexenus, cap. 2 (a passage obviously borrowed from this), Socrates is repre­ sented as describing in his ironical way the feelings produced in his mind by the funeral orations at Athens. "
They are so full," he says, " of indiscriminate eulogy, first upon those just dead, then upon our forefathers, and then even upon ourselves who are yet alive, that as I listen I feel myself growing in size and in grace and in dignity;
aye, and for days after I can scarce realize who and where I am;
for I seem to be all but dwelling in the Islands of the Blest, μόνον OVK ἐν μακάρων νήσοις οἰκεῖν."
These Isles of the Blessed, so beautifully described by Pindar in his second Olympian ode, were the holy and happy resting-places reserved for the pure in heart.

πε­ παίνειν is to assuage, to mollify, to soften:
as fruit by ripening, metals by fusing, grain by steeping, and the like.
Scholiast.
πρὸς ἐμοῦ means in my interest.
The usage is a common one, and it will be sufficient to refer with Bergler to Œd. Tyr. 1434, where Œdipus making a request to Creon says, πιθοῦ τί μοί πρὸς σοῦ γὰρ οὐ' ἐμοῦ φράσω. 0 2648. μύλην ἀγαθήν.]
The speaker had used the word πεπα̑ναι, which, as already observed, is applicable to the softening of grain and the like.
Pursuing the metaphor, he adds, " The ordinary soften­ ing process will prove unavailing against the extreme hardness of my disposition (unless indeed you can say something very much to the point):
and therefore your only chance is to try the other mode of dealing with hard and intract­ able grain, and look out for a good new millstone wherewith to crush it."
ἐρει̑ξαι is the proper term for crushing corn in a hand-mill.
650.
χαλεπόν.]
Philocleon has stated his case before the Arbitrators, and it is now Bdelycleon's turn.
His argument consists, not of any criticism upon the law or upon the practice of the Athenian dicasteries, but of proof that the power obtained by the alliance of the dema­ gogues and the dicasts is wielded exclusively for the benefit of the dema­ gogues, and not in any way for the benefit of the dicasts.
The two speeches may in fact be summed up in a very few words.
"Ours is a μεγάλη ἀρχὴ)," says Philocleon, " for all men, even the great demagogues themselves, are ready to court and to flatter us." " Yours is a μεγάλη δουλεία," retorts Bdelycleon, " for the demagogues retain to themselves every substantial advantage, and leave you to penury and starvation.
"652. ὠ̑ πάτεp ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη.]
Philo­ cleon had concluded his panegyrical oration by arrogating to himself the dignity and the attributes of Zeus.
See the note on 621 supra.
Bdelycleon therefore in opening his reply addresses him in the language with which Zeus is addressed by Athene in the Homeric poems, ὠ̑ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, Iliad viii. 31, Odyssey i.45, 81. But Philocleon interrupts him at once. " Μὴ πατέριζε," he says, " don't befather me:
that will not avail you:
what you have to do is to prove your case, and convince me that I am a slave."
Bdely­ clean accordingly drops the heroic style, and addresses his father as ὠ̑ παππίδιον.
This is better than the Scholiast's explanation, ἔμελλεν εἰπει̑ν, σοὶ πάντ
α
And therefore unless you can speak to the point, you must look for a millstone handy and good, Fresh hewn from the rock, to shiver and shock the unyielding grit of my resolute mood.

The observation of Conz that Κρονίδης means stultus,fatuus, like Κρόνος, Κρόνιππος, Κρονίων ὄζων, is singularly unfortunate, since it was precisely by way of contrast to Κρονίδης the leader of the νεώτερ

Mitchell follows Conz, but Richter takes the correct view.
πατέριζε is a word formed by way of response to the pre­ ceding πάτερ, just as in Thesm.

φόρον.]
It is impossible now to ascertain with certainty the amount of the annual tribute paid by the Allies to Athens at the date of the Wasps.
Under the original assessment of Aristides about the year B.C. 477 the money pay­ ment amounted to 460 talents a year (Thuc. i. 96).
Before the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, B.C. 431, it hadreached the sum of 600 talents (Thuc. ii. 13).
And it had doubtless been again largely augmented before B.C. 422.
Many causes co-operated to this rapid increase.
Allies who had formerly furnished only ships and men, had been brought, willingly or unwillingly, to contribute money instead:
fresh tribute was exacted from conquered states, such for example as Cythera, which was required to pay four talents a year (Thuc. iv. 57);
and even the money payments which Aris­ tides had assessed appear to have been subsequently increased.
It is said that the aggregate contributions ultimately amounted to a sum of 1300 talents, or upwards of 300,000l.
a year (Plutarch, Aristides, cap. 24).658. τέλη.]
These various sources of revenue have been carefully and for the most part very satisfactorily investigated and explained by Boeckh (Public Eco­ nomy of Athens, Book iii.) and Schömann (De Comitiis, Book ii. chap. 9).
I differ, however, from those distinguished writers with respect to the words τέλη and ἑκατοστὰς, which seem to me intended to comprise all the ordinary Athenian revenues, and not to constitute mere items of revenue, co-ordinate with those enumerated in the following line.
The items specified in line 659 are in my opinion explanatory of, and not super- added to, the τέλη and ἑκατοσταί.
This distinction seems sufficiently indicated by the presence of the definite article in the first line, and its omission from the second:
and in truth the expression τέλη of itself includes all payments made to the state, nor are there any more familiar instances of τέλη than the market and harbour dues (ἀγοραὶ, λιμένες) mentioned in the following line.
Cf. Acharnians, 896, and see the next note.
The only ἑκατοστὴ too of which we have any information appears to have been a harbour duty.
In the treatise de Repub­ lica Atheniensium (attributed to Xeno­ phon), i. 17.
it is said that in consequence of the resort of the Allies to the Athenian law-courts, the state acquired a larger revenue from the one-per-cent.
in the Piræus, ἡ ἑκατοστὴ τη̨̑ πόλει πλείων ἡ ἐν Πειραιει̂.
It would seem from the pre­ sent passage that there were in fact other taxes of the same amount:
unless (which is perhaps equally probable) Aristophanes includes in the word all percentages, εἰκοσταὶ, πεντηκοσταὶ, and the like, as opposed to payments of a definite sum, irrespective of the value of the article taxed.

πρυτανει̂α.] " Prytaneia, in which with the inaccuracy of a poet Aristo­ phanes includes the fines.
"
—Boeckh, ubi supra.
Although I have translated πρυτανει̂α 'fees and fines,' I in no way assent to the justice ofBoeckh's criticism, which rests wholly on what I consider the erroneous assumption that Aristo-And then, in addition to this, compute the many taxes and one-per-cents, The fees and the fines, and the silver mines, the markets and harbours and sales and rents.
If you take the total result of the lot, 'twill reach two thousand talents or near.
And next put down the Justices' pay, and reckon the sums they receive a year:
phanes is necessarily giving an exhaus­ tive catalogue of the sources of Athenian revenue.
The πρυτανει̑α or court fees which a litigant was bound to deposit before the suit commeuced (see Clouds, 1136, 1255), became, in consequence of the resort of the Allies to the Athenian law-courts, no inconsiderable item in the imperial revenue.
In the passage from the De Rep. Ath.
referred to above, this increase in the Prytaneia is men­ tioned as the very first argument in favour of that stroke of Athenian policy, πρω̑τον μὲν ἀπὸ τω̑ν πρυτανείων τὸν μισθὸν δι' ἐνιαυτου̑ λαμβάνειν (i. 16), where see Schneider's notes.
The remaining items are sufficiently explained by Boeckh and Schömann.
By μέταλλα we are to un­ derstand the income derived from the silver mines of Laurium (Hdt. vii. 144).
See Boeckh's Dissertation appended to the English translation of his Political Economy, and Grote's History of Greece, chapter 39.
On ἀγορὰς and λιμένας the Scholiast remarks, τὰ ἀπὸ τη̑ς ἀγορα̑ς καὶ τω̑ν λιμένων TEAH ὐπομιμνήσκει.
Μισθοὶ seem to be rents derived from public properties let out to farm or hire;
whilst δημιόπρατα are the proceeds arising from the public sale of confiscated estates.
In Knights 103, Cleon is represented as gorged with a hearty meal off δημιόπρατα.660.
δισχίλια.]
In the seventh book of the Anabasis, i. 27, Xenophon is endeavouring to dissuade the Ten Thou­ sand from provoking the vengeance of Sparta.
" For Athens," he says, " en­ tered upon the Peloponnesian War with numerous fleets, and ample treasures, and a yearly revenue ἀπό τε τω̑ν ἐνδήμων Kat ἐκ τη̑ς ὑπερ
ορίας of not less than 1000 talents:
moreover, she was mistress of all the isles, and possessed many cities in Asia, and many more in Europe, and this very Byzantium where now we are :
and yet she was vanquished by the Spartan confederacy, which was then less powerful than now."
If Xenophon means to include, in his estimate of 1000 talents, the tribute from the Allies and subject cities (a point which does not seem to me quite certain), we must sup­ pose either (1) that he is understating the amount, or (2) that Aristophanes is overstating it, or (3) that the revenue had doubled between B.C. 431 and B.C. 422.
The first hypothesis may be con­ sidered out of the question, since Xeno­ phon would have been on that particular occasion inclined to exaggerate rather than to understate the resources of Athens.
Boeckh (iii. 19) is of opinion that the revenue had in fact very largely increased before the date of the Wasps.
And see the note on 657 supra.
Yet even so it is extremely probable that Aristophanes is to some extent over­ stating the actual amount.662.
ἕξχιλιάσιν.]
This was the actual number of the Heliasts.
The subject is discussed in the Preface.
προχωρούντων.—Scholiast.
The pay of 6000 dicasts would be 18,000 obols, or 3000 drachmæ, or 30 minæ, or exactly half a talent a day.
Exclusive of holi­ days on which the courts would not sit, there were 300 working days in the year:
and the aggregate yearly pay of the dicasts would therefore amount to 150 talents.

He is referring to Philocleon's words supra 593.
And compare Knights, 1341.669.
πεντήκοντα τάλαντα.]
Not that the demagogues appropriate these amounts out of the public funds:
but that the subject states, terrified by their violence, and regarding them as the real motive power at Athens, seek to propitiate them, and win their protection, by gifts of money and goods.
A notable instance of this sort of bribery is mentioned in the note to 35 supra.
And in Peace, 644-6, Aristophanes reiterates the charge in pointed and forcible language.

All the great prizes, he means, are carried off by the demagogues:

By such small phrases as these cajoled, you lift them over yourselves to reign.
And then, believe me, they soon contrive some fifty talents in bribes to gain, Extorting them out of the subject states, by hostile menace and angry frown :
Hand over, they say, the tribute-pay, or else my thunders shall crush your town.
You joy the while at the remnants vile, the trotters and tips of your power to gnaw.

The words τὸν ἄλλον are used to exclude the ruling classes, but they seem also to convey a sort of contemptuous meaning :
"the residuum of the populace."674.

—Scholiast.
The quaint phraseology of the line seems to indicate that it is either a quotation or a parody.
The general meaning of the passage is as follows:
—When the Allies perceive the demagogues wielding the real power of the state, and you the mass of the popu­ lace growing lanky and lean on a verdict- box funnel, and regaled upon nothing at all (that is to say, amusing yourselves with your dicastic privileges, with barely sufficient to keep you from starvation), they make no account of you ;
but to the demagogues they bring ὕρχας, οἰ̄νον, κ.τ.λ.675.
Kóννου ψη̑φον.]
Connas appears to be the dissolute musician described in Knights, 534, as consumed by perpetual thirst.
He became a pauper, and ac­ cording to the Scholiast the expression Κόννου θρι̑ον was used as a synonym for anything absolutely valueless.
Here Aristophanes unexpectedly substitutes ψη̑φον for θρι̂ον (just as he had substi­ tuted ψηφίσματα for μυστήρια supra 378, and μισθὸν for κύλικα supra 525), διὰ τὸ περὶ δικαστ
ου̑ λέγειν, as if Philocleon could not be appropriately compared to any­ thing but one of his own favourite ψη̑φοι.
Some writers consider Connas identical with Connos the sou of Metrobius, the διδάσκαλος μουσικη̑ς to Socrates :
but this seems exceedingly doubtful.677.
πλουθυγίειαν.]
A word appa­ rently invented by Aristophanes to ex­ press the combination of all the elements of physical prosperity, " health of body and wealth of store."

It is humorously introduced in this place as the sum and crown of the offerings made by the allies to the demagogues.

Observe the allite­ ration in this verse.
It is, however, no doubt unintentional.
The trick so com­ mon in the Roman dramatists of appeal­ ing to the ear by the jingle of words, either commencing with the same letter (" non potuit paucis plum plane pro­ loqui," Plautus, Men. ii. 1. 27) or having similar terminations, belongs to a much later date, and is quite foreign to the vigorous thought and energetic rhythm of Aristophanic comedy.
686.
εισεθύν.]
Not, I think, domum tuam ingressus, as Brunck translates it, and as it is universally rendered.
I take εἰσελθὸν to mean “ came forward in the Assembly," and εἴπη, “ moved a resolu­ tion," as supra 595, and passim.
I imagine that by some recent order of the Assembly, the court-doors, κιγκλίδες, were to be closed so soon as proceedings commenced, and no dicast to be admitted afterwards.
See infra 775 and 892.
And thus we see the full meaning of ἐπιταττό­ μενος in the preceding verse. "
You are not even your own masters,” says Bdely­ cleon, “ free to attend at what hour you choose:
you are under orders:
you must go before proceedings commence, or lose even your miserable pittance."
Of the person here described as Χαιμέον νἰὸς, nothing is known.
The Scholiast says,690. σημείου
When the hour for the opening of a court or assembly arrived,a signal, σημεῖον, was hoisted over the place of meeting.
Its exact form is un.
known, but it is generally supposed to have been a lofty pole or standard of some sort.
See Schömann, De Comitiis, i. 13.
Probably loiterers would delay their coming until they actually saw the signal up;
and hence the necessity for some such regulation as that mentioned in the preceding note, to secure a more punctual attendance.
In Thesmoph. 277 (to which Bergler refers), Mnesilo­ chus is adjured to make haste to the meeting, ὠς τὸ τῆς ἐκκλησίας.

Bdelycleon is endeavouring to disgust his father with his dicastic duties, by pointing out the humiliating position in which the dicasts are occasionally placed.

A somewhat different mode of conveying liquids by means of wool is mentioned by Plato, Symposium, cap. 3.

"704. ἐπισίςῃ.]
ἐπισίζείν is to utter the sibilation which sets on a dog to fight.
Brunck refers to Theocritus, vi. 29, σίξα (so Ruhnken for σῖγα) 8' ὑλακτεῖν νιν καὶ τᾶ κυνὶ, "I incited the dog to bark at her."
ἐπιρρύξας has the like meaning, as Brunck also observes, citing Hesychius, ἐπιρρύζεν κύνας, ἐπαφιέναι /καὶ παρορμᾷν.
So also the Scholiast here, ἀπὸ τη̑ς ever, is formed not from the sibilant S, but from the canina litera R.
Our old writers called it " to tarre a dog on," whence possibly the name " terrier."
Shakespeare's King John, iv.
1, [The fire] perchance will sparkle in your eyes, And like a dog that is compelled to fight, Snatch at the master that doth tarre him on.
Bergler refers to Olynth.
iii. p. 37, a passage which bears a very striking resemblance to this speech of Bdelycleon. "
'Tis those who transact the affairs of state," Demosthenes says, " that get the whole advantage, while yon the Demus fill but a servant's position, content, άγαπω̑ντες, and gratified if they do but allow yon free entrance to the spectacles and public games, giving you what was your own before.

Follow my advice," he adds, " and you will secure great and ample benefits, and get rid of these miserable doles, which are like the driblets of food allowed to the sick, enough to keep them from dying, but not enough to give them strength.
"707. Χιλιαι.]
This is probably not intended as an exact computation:
the poet is speaking in round numbers, Τῷ ὰπηρτισμένῳ ἀριθμῷ ἐΧρήσατο, as the Scholiast says:
but nevertheless the statement is believed to come very near the mark.
See Boeckh, iii. 16.
The 20,000 Athenians for whom provision is thus to be made, are by Colonel Leake (Attica, App. 21), Boeckh (i. 7), and others supposed to include the entire number of Athenian citizens.
I cannot agree in this view, or think it likely that Aristophanes would comprehend the wealthy and ruling classes in his gigantic system of outdoor relief.
He himself in Eccl. 1132 reckons the number of Athenian citizens as "over 30,000;
" agreeing with Hdt. v. 97, and (appa-They want you to know your keeper's hand ;

Axiochus, 369 A. Other writers, it is true, put the number at 20,000 (Demos­ thenes contra Aristogit.
Or. i. 785;
Plutarch, Lycurg. Orat. vit. 34;
Ath. vi. cap. 103):
but these are all referring to a later period, when the population of Athens was no longer at its height.
And I cannot doubt that at the date of the Wasps the number of Athenian citizens (in the estimation of Aristophanes at least) considerably exceeded 20,000.
And see the note on 718 infra.709.
ἐν πα̑σι λαγῴοις.]
We should certainly have expected α̑ν here, and Dawes (Misc. Crit. 275) accordingly sub­ stitutes that particle for ἐν.
But this alteration, though supported by some of the inferior MSS., seems quite inadmis­ sible.
The phrase ἐν πα̑σι λαγῴοις is essentially different from that with which Dawes compares it, τῷ ζω̑σι;
ΣΙΔ.
Γάλοκτι καὶ τυροῖσι καὶμήλων βορᾳ̑ (Eurip. Cyclops, 121).
Like ̀́̑̒̓ἐν πα̑σι βολίτος in Ach.
1026, it is a parody on the common phrase ἐν πα̑σιν ἀγαθοι̑ς, and signifies, not the food by which life is sustained, but the luxury in the midst of which it is passed.
Dobree's suggestion, to change μυριμ́δες into μυριμ́δ’ α̑ν, is less open to objection:
but I am myself inclined to think that the α̑ν is purposely omitted, in order to present a more vivid picture, as of an actual reality, and not a mere possible contingency.
As to λαγῷα and πυὸς, see the note on Peace, 1150.711.
του̑ Μαραθω̑νι τροπαίου.]
The plains of Marathon were covered with memorials of the great battle (Pausanias, Attica, 32).
There were two mounds or barrows erected over the dead, one for the citizens, another for the Platæans and for the slaves.
The barrow over the Athenian citizens still stands, a con­ spicuous and solemn object, upon the solitary plain (Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. vi.):
it is about thirty feet high, and 200 yards round;
and in the light sandy mould of which it is composed travellers still find arrow-heads of brass and flint, the broken relics of the invader's weapons (Dodwell's Tour, ii. 159;
Leake's Demi, ii. 100).
Some vestiges too re­ main of the other barrow;
and there are various monumental ruins, comprising probably the separate μνη̑μα Μιλτιάου and the orient upon which were recorded the names and tribes of the Athenian dead.
The TROPHY itself was an edifice λίθου λευκου̑ (Pausanias ubi supra):
andits remains are still believed to exist in a ruin called Pyrgo, found about 500 yards north of the great barrow, and consisting " of the foundation of a square monu­ ment constructed of large blocks of white marble" (Leake, ii. 101).
That trophy was the proudest heirloom of Athenian glory.
Themistocles (Plutarch, cap.
3) declared that the thought of it would not let him sleep.
Aristophanes appeals to it again, and always as striking the deepest chord of Athenian patriotism, Knights, 1334;
Lysistrata, 285.

It is probable that many from the neediest classes went out to take part in the olive-picking of Attica, as in the hop-picking and harvest with ourselves.
And the dicasts, compelled to resort to the Colacretse for their three obols, are likened by Bdelycleon to these destitute hirelings, crowding on ' after the man who is to pay them their wages.

This observation of the Scholiast strongly confirms the arrange­ ment adopted 522 supra, where see the note.715.

Are for giving;

The statements in the text might reasonably be con­ sidered mere vague and general satire;
but in M. Boeckh's opinion (i. 15) they rest on a real historical basis.
It appears from Philochorus (cited by the Scholiast) that some hostile proceedings had been undertaken against Eubœa a year or two before the date of the Wasps;
and the popular leaders may have proposed to allot a portion of the Eubœan territory to κληρου̑Χοι (as Peri-Whilst now like gleaners ye all are fain to follow along in the paymaster's train.

and at the same time to gratify the people with one of those public distributions of corn, which werenot uncommon either at Athens or at Rome (see Boeckh ubi supra).
If so, the project seems to have been abandoned;
and a smaller largess recently (πρώην) made, in lieu of the great distribution originally contemplated.
κατὰ is at the rate of, as supra 669.νους.—Scholiast.
No one was entitled to share in these public distributions, un­ less he were an Athenian citizen;

For the rigour with which claims to share in these distributions were disputed, Mit­ chell refers to Plutarch, Pericles, cap. 37, where out of about 19,040 claimants (not representing, I apprehend, the entire number of citizens, but answering to the 20,000 mentioned in 709 supra) about 5000 were disqualified as νόθοι;

The Arguments are over, and the Arbitrators proceed to deliver their decision.
The Scholiast refers to the maxim μηδὲ δίκην δικάσῃς πρὶν ἂνἀμΦοίν μυ̑θον ἀκούῃς, which is very frequently quoted by ancient writers, and is usually attributed to Phocylides;
see Bergk's Poetæ Lyrici, Pseudo-Phocylidea,line 87.
The maxim was embodied in the judicial oath, τὸνὂρκον, says Demosthenes at the commencement of his oration De Corona, ἐν ὦ̜καὶ του̑το γέγραπται, τὸὁμοίως ἀμΦοîν ἀκροάσασθαι.
Bergler cites Eurip.

also the oath given in Dem. contr. Timocr., which is now however generally supposed to be spurious.

It is very frequently cm­ ployed by ecclesiastical writers to denote persons of the same creed or party.733.
παρών.]
παρὼν, like the Latin præsens, is used of the present inter- position of the deity by direct agency, or by visible manifestation.
In line 73.5 it is with some humour transferred to the corresponding attitude to be assumed by the recipient of the divine favour.738.
σισύραν.]
A thick woolly wrap, in Aristophanes generally mentioned as a luxurious and somewhat effeminate article (Clouds, 10;
infra 1138;
Birds, 122;
Lys. 933;
Frogs, 1459;
Eccl.840):
but elsewhere used of the shaggy garb of the peasant.
See Ruhnken's Timæus sub voe.;
Seller on Alciphron, iii. 26.742. προσέσθαι.] προσέσθαι is the 2nd aorist middle of προσίημι, aud means “ to recommend itself to," "to please," "to attract" (ἐΦελκύσασθαι, Suidas a. v.).
Two passages are cited in which the word bears the same meaning, έν δ’ οὐ προσίεταί με, Knights, 359;
and τῶν μὲν δὴ οὐδὲν προσίετό μιν, Hdt. i. 48.
It is more commonly used in the converse sense "to take to,”“to be pleased wIth, as τὸ ὑπαίτιον εἰναί τινι οὐ πάνυ προσὶεμαι, Xen. Mem. ii. 8. 5, and frequently elsewhere.
The double usage arises from the double aspect in whichwe may regard the relation subsisting between the mind which is pleased, and the object which pleases it;
and corre­ sponds very closely to the double usage of our English word to like, which means either "to be pleased with" or "to please," as in Shakespeare's Two Gentlemen of Verona, iv.

I do not see how this passage can possibly bear the meaning attributed to it by Brunck and others, "criminique sibimet ipse vertit, quæcunque tu ilium hortatus es, se iis obsecutum non fuisse."
It seems to me that the Chorus are referring to the thesis proposed by Bdelycleon for the contest which has just terminated, supra 514, where see the note.
He has taken himself to task, they mean, as to those pursuits on which he formerly doted :
for he is now awake to the truth, and reckons all those pursuits to be errors which he would not, at your bid­ ding, admit to be so.
He recognizes the truth of the charges which he formerly denied, and which you undertook to prove.
This speech of the Chorus is antistrophical to the breceding one, 729—736.CHOR.
'Tis that his soberer thoughts review The frenzy he indulged so long, And (what he would not yield to you) He feels his former life was wrong.
Perchance he'll now amend his plan, Unbend his age to mirth and laughter, A better and a wiser man
By your advice he'll live hereafter.

μή μοι τούτωνμηδὲν ὑπισχνοῦ.]
Philocleon at length breaks his tragic silence, and gives utterance to a cento of scraps from the Hippolytus Velatus, Alcestis, Bellerophon, and probably other Plays of Euripides.
The Scholiast's gloss ‛Ιππολύτου Εὐριπίδου properly belongs to the line before us, and refers no doubt to that lost play which the grammarians cite under the name of the ‛Ιππόλυτ
ος καλυπτόμενος.
By the word τοὐτων Philo­ cleon is alluding to the ὃσα πρεσβὑτη̜ ξὑμ­ φορα which Bdelycleon had enumerated above:
whilst κείνων in the next line refers to the pleasures of a dicastic life.751.
κεένων ἒραμαι.]
This is parodied, as Bergler observes, from Alcestis, 884, There are no grounds for drawing down to this line the gloss cited in the preced­ ing note ( see Wagner on Hippol. Fragm. 19):
the words μὴ μοι τούτωνμηδὲν ὑπ­ ισχνοῦ are clearly of tragic origin ;
while the present line is found not in the Hippolytus, but in the Alcestis.
Valck­ naer's suggestion that the words κείνων ἒραμαι, κεῖθι γενοίμαν were the original form of Hipp. 230, and Porson's that they have dropped out from between Hipp. 216 and 217, are alike unnecessary and improbable.756.
σπεῦδ᾽, ὦ ψυχή.]
Philocleon is carried away by his vivid recollection of the familiar scene in the dicastery, and acts it over again in imagination.
The line is apparently a parody of some passage wherein a Tragic hero is apos­ trophizing his own soul, and inciting it to deeds of daring. "
Where hast thou been, my heart?
”—Shakespeare’s Ant. and Cleo. iii. 11. Compare Acharnians, 483—9.
But I take the expression, as adopted by Philocleon, to be addressed not to his soul, but to his vote, which he calls by that endearing appellation, ξωὴ Kal anima mea.
He pictures him­ self standing over the verdict-box, and about to deposit his vote.
He has pro­ longed the enjoyment until all the rest have voted, and he still toys with his vote, as reluctant to part with it.
First he exhorts it to make haste, as the κήρυξ is about to close the voting :
then he pretends to lose it, and fumbles for it:
finally he throws it in, with resolute energy.
The words ποῦ μοι ψυχὴ imply that the action of Philocleon is arrested by his momentary inability to find the object required:
the epithet σκιερὰ,* as applied to the vote, means that it is lost in some obscure place.
757.
πάρες, ὦ σκιερά.]
The Scholiast observes that these words are taken from the Bellerophon, and they are plainly part of the anapæstic system which is spoken by Bellerophon as he gradually rises from the earth, and which is parodied at some length in the Peace.
See the note on Peace, 73.

And very aptly, if the morning's fine," Suffer, 0 shadowy foliage, that I ascend up above the watered glades.
"758. μὴ νῦν.]
The time for delay is over, and Philocleon throws in his vote of condemnation with energy and de­ cision.
He is not yet weaned from his love of the dicasteries, but he is, at all events, alienated from Cleon, and avows his determination to show him no mercy when next he is brought before them on a charge of peculation.
The words μὴ λάβοιμι (like our " don't let me catch ”) imply a menace.
ἀπειλεî κατα­ δικάσειν τὸν κλέωνα, says the Scholiast, εἰ λάβοι αὐτὸν ἐγκαλούμενον περὶ κλοπῆς.

4. The phrase before us is probably taken from some legal formula.rationi consentaneum est, Brunck.
But in the present passage the meaning seems rather to be "appropriately."
Aristo­ phanes is paving the way for the double pun which he is about to introduce.
In fine weather, he says, ἡλιάσει πρὸς ἣλιον, in wet weather εἴσει, which is really from εἴσομαι (Plutus, 647), and is ex­ plained by the Scholiasts as equivalent to δικάσεις, γνώσῃ, but upon which Aris­ tophanes plays as if it were from εἲσειμι, and meant “ you will go indoors."
The word ἡλιάσει is in reality derived from, or connected with, ὰλίξεσθαι to assemble, and has nothing to do with ῆλιος.
See the Preface.775. ἀποκλεσει.]
Dicasts who came too late were excluded, and lost their three obols.

It would have been hardly possible for the Colacretæ to provide every day the enormous number of obols required for the daily payment of the dicastic fees:
and it must have been the rule, rather than the exception, for two or more dicasts to receive a larger coin, which they were themselves to change, and share between them.
789.
ἐν τοῖς
That is to say, In the fish-market.
So in Frogs, 1068 (to which Conz also refers), παρὰ τοὺς ἰχθῦς ἀνέκυψεν, which the Scholiast ex­ plains by παρὰτὰὶχθυοπώλια.
TO δὲ τοιοῦτον ’Αττικόν.
Εὒπολις“περιῆλθον ές τὰσκόροδα καὶ τὰ κρόμμυα.”
In many cases where we should speak of the fish-market, the vegetable-market, the flower-market, and the like, the Athenians preferred to say merely the fishes, the vegetables, the flowers, or other article of merchandise.
οἱ ’Αττικοὶ (says Pollux, ix.

It is found also in Latin writers.

Small images, sym­ bols, or shrines, of Hecate were ex­ tremely common in the streets of Athens.
Wealthy citizens were accustomed to erect them before their doors, in the hope that Hecate, as representing the Moon, would guard their mansions dur-Then laid me down three mullet scales:

Now then I hope you're satisfied:
I've broughting the hours of darkness.
Other He­ catæa were placed ἐν ται̑ς τριόδοις, triviis, in places where three roads met.
Every month, when the new moon appeared, an offering was laid upon these shrines of Hecate (Schol. at Plutus, 594):
but their proximity to the public thorough- fares rendered them obnoxious to the depredations of pilferers (Plutus, ubi supra), and also, it would seem from Frogs 366, to insults similar to those which Philocleon had been wont to com­ mit at the shrine of Lyeus (supra 394).
It was only during the night that the protection of Hecate was available:
during the day, the house was entrusted to the guardianship of Apollo, whose obelisk, surrounded by his own favourite aurel (Thesm. 489), also stood in a pro­ minent position near the vestibule, τοὐ μου̑ προθύρου προπύλαιος (infra 875, where see the note).
Yet, after all these pre­ cautions, it was thought prudent to propitiate Hermes by placing his sym­ bol also before the door, ἐπὶ άποτροπη̨̂ τω̑ν ἄλλων κλεπτω̑ν, says the Scholiast on Plutus, 1153.
It is to this third symbol that Strepsiades appeals in Clouds, 1478.
The insults to which the Hermæ were subjected on a notable occasion (Thue. vi. 27), and the grave results which followed, arc matters of history.
To the innumerable shrines and symbols of these three ἐνύιοι δαίμονες (see Scholiast on Plato, Laws, xi. 914 B) were now to be added, according to the prophecy, in­ numerable little Courts of Law, one at the door of every house.813.
κἄν yap πυρέττω.]
Philocleon, when ill and feverish, was accustomed to remain at home and nurse himself, sit­ ting by the fire, and sipping his gruel, after the fashion of invalids.
Hitherto this indulgence had entailed the loss of his three obols :
but under the new sys­ tem it will no longer prevent his per­ forming his dicastic duties, and earning his dicastic fee.
The Scholiast says, ὡς καὶ φακη̑ς ̓ῤοφήματος διδομένου τοι̑ς ἀσθε­ νου̑σιν.
̒Ροφει̑ν, to swill, is especially used in reference to soup, broth, por­ ridge, and the like.
Cf. Peace, 716. Berg­ ler refers to Antiphanes (apud Ath. iv. 44), ῥοφει̑ν φακη̑ν ἕσθ' ἡδὺ, μὴ δεδοι­ κότα Μαλακω̑ς καθεύδειν, ἄθλιον, δεδοικότα.
What could induce Bathe and Hermann to remove this line from its present posi­ tion where the MSS.
place it and the sense requires it, and to insert it, the former after line 786, the latter after line 797 (in neither of which situations does it make any sense at all), I cannot even conjecture.816.

He prefers the request in this coaxing indirect manner, because he can hardly venture to hope for so great a privilege.
Bdelycleon, however, is equal to the occasion, and has already provided not only a little shrine, but also a representation of Lycus himself.
The exclamation ὠ δέσποθ' ἥρως, ὡς χαλεπὸς ἄρ' ἠσθ' ἰδει̑ν I take to be a genuine expres­ sion of admiration on Philocleon's part at the stern and terrible aspect of his favourite :
whilst in the next line Bdely­ eleon, beating about for rome fiercc and martial object wherewith to compare him, lights παρὰ προσδοκίαν on the name of κλεώνυμ

This was the commonest name for a maid-servant at Athens.
It occurs in the Acharnians, the Peace, and the Thesmophoriazusæ.
In the Theæte­ tus (chap. 24) it is the name of the smart and natty handmaiden, ἐμμελὴς καὶ χαρίεσσα θεραπαινὶς, who rallied Thales for tumbling into the well.
The sage, gazing upwards at the stars, had en­ tirely overlooked the peril which was lying at his feet.
And in truth, ob­ serves Socrates, a philosopher when he comes down to the world is an object of derision, not merely to Thrattas, but to the general populace as well, γέλωτα παρέχει οὐ μόνον Θρά̩τταις, ἀλλὰ Kal τω̨̑ ἄλλω̨ ὄχλω̨.

Whilst Philocleon is gone in quest of a railing, a sudden scuffle takes place within, and immediately afterwards the voice of Xanthias is heard, exclaiming at the dog.836.
Λάβης.]
The name of a dog (from λαμβάνω), Grip, Pincher, or the like.
Aristophanes is so preparing matters that Philocleon will hear, in caricature, the very cause which was to be brought that day before the dicastery (supra 240—242), viz. the impeachment of Laches by Clean, or (as the names stand in the parody) of Labes by Cyan.
The name Κύων in 841, 895, 902, should be written with a capital K.
And as Laches was accused of embezzling the Sicilian spoil, so Labes is to be accused of devouring a Sicilian cheese, the special production of the island.

Sicily was the great dairy-land of antiquity ;
her hills and plains were covered with innumerable herds :
her βουκόλοι figure everywhere in the Idylls of Theocritus:
and indeed it is from them that Bucolic poetry (both the name and the thing) was originally derived.
Her cheese was renowned all over Hellas (see the note on Peace, 250) :
and her τροφαλὶς τυροrupου̂, an elongated cream cheese, was her especial pride and glory, Σικελίας αὕχημα

χοιροκομει̑ον.]
Philocleon returns in triumph, bearing the little fence be­ hind which the pigs were kept.
The Scholiast says, χοιροκμει̑όν ἐστι ζωγρει̑ύν τι (so I read for ἐστιν ἀγγει̑όν τι) καννωτὸν, ὅπου οἱ χοι̑ροιτρέφονται.
ἑστίας δὲ, ἐπεὶ ἐπὶ τη̑ς ἑστίας τρέφουσι χοίρους. εἰσφέρει δὲ του̑το ἀντὶ δρυφάκτου.
That pigs were in some sense or other inmates of Athe­ nian houses is plain from Plutus 1106, where Hermes says to Cario (to cite from Mr. Rudd's pleasant translation), Run, fetch your master out, And then his wife and children, then the slaves and dog, And after them yourself, and after you the hog.
But we have already seen (see note on 179 supra) that the stables themselves were within the hall door:
and we need not suppose that the pigs dwelt with the human inhabitants as they do in Irish cabins, or as, it is said (Hallam's Middle Ages, iii. 355, note), oxen for­ merly did in Cheshire cottages.
And see the description which Xenophon (Anab. iv.
5) gives of the underground dwellings in Armenia B.C. 401, a description which exactly tallies with that given by Mr. Cur­ zon (Armenia, chap. iii.)A.D. 1838.
In the present passage Ἑστία means Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, and not, as the Scholiast takes it, and as I, to preserve the play of words, have thought it best to translate it, the actual hearth itself.
846. ἀφ' Ἑστίας ὰρχόμενος.]
In solemn festivals, the first libation was poured, the firstlings of the sacrifice were offered, to Hestia, the guardian of the hearth.
And hence the expression ἀφ' Ἑστίας ἄρχεσθαι became a common phrase, meaning, To begin at the very beginning, to perform an operation thoroughly, in regular order, omitting nothing.
The Scholiast refers to Plato, Euthyphron (caps. 2 and 3), where Socrates commends his Accuser for beginning his reforma­ tion of the State by dealing with the corrupters of youth:
he will first (So-BDEL.

In the Cra­ tylus (cap. 18) Socrates proposes to in­ vestigate, etymologically, the names which men have given to the gods, and he says ἅλλο τι ού̄ν ἀφ' Ἑστίας ἀρχώμεθα κατὰ τὸν νόμον.

The arrangements are now complete:
and Bdelycleon calls for fire and myrtles and incense, that the pro­ ceedings may be inaugurated in solemn form with prayer and praise and reli­ gious worship.
The incense was burned before the Aguieus:
the myrtles were wreathed in garlands alike around the brows of the worshippers and about the sacred obelisk of the god.
For some­ what similar preparations Bergler refers to Frogs, 871, and Mitchell to Thesm.

The Scholiast says, πρὸ τω̑ν θυρω̑ν ἔθος ει̉χον name is derived from its proximity to the public streets:

Standing out conspicuously in front of the house, it was the last object of which a wanderer took farewell at hisdeparture, the first which he greeted on his return.

The ancients them­ selves did not know for what reasons the symbol of Apollo assumed the form of an obelisk:
and it may be worth observing that in Egypt also an obelisk represented the worship of the Sun:

Bdelycleon had exhausted all the recognized rites of the country in attempting to cure his father's monomania:
but they failing (ὅτε ταύταιςται̑ς τελεται̑ς οὐκὠφέλει, supra 121), he is now striking out a new line, and introducing a novel rite of his own invention.
καινοτομει̑ν is specially applied to innovations in religion (see Plato's Euthyphron, 3 B, 5 A, 16 A), and is con­ stantly so used in the early ecclesiastical writers.

ἀντὶ σιραίου.]
σίραιον in this pas­ sage appears at first -eight to be con­ trasted with μέλι, and it was therefore natural to suppose that it was intended as an emblem of sourness.
But σίριον is in truth new wine, boiled and sweetened;
and is uniformly described by express reference to its luscious sweet­ ness :
σίραιον ἐκάλουν τὸνἐκ γλεύκους ἑψημένον γλυκύν.—Pollux, vi. segm. 16. γλυκὺ ἔψημα.—Galen, τὸγλυκὺκαὶ ἐψη­ μένον οἰνον.
Hesychius s. v.
To these passages, mentioned by Florent Chretien and Bergler, I may add the definition given by Photius, TOV ἑψημένον οἰνονκαὶ γλυκύν.
To get rid of this obvious diffi­ culty the Scholiast suggests that σίραιον, when boiled, may have a touch of acidity:
Reiske says, " si mihi de melle Anti­ cyrano constaret 'Αντικυρίου legerem :
" whilst Rudd translates as.
if σίραιον were the offering of Bdelycleon to the god, in return for which he was to infuse honcy into the mind of Philocleon.
None of these suggestions is in my judgment satisfactory :
and I think that a play of words is intended (cf. infra 1082) between θῡμίδιον the diminutive of θυμὸς, and θῠμίδιον (or θύμιον) the dimi­ nutive of θὐμος, the wild herb or vege­ table which was so much eaten by the Athenian poor (Plutus, 253), and there­ fore, no doubt, by the needy dicasts.
If, as is probable enough, this food was sauced and flavoured with σίριον, the meaning of the passage becomes clear.
" Mix," prays Bdelycleon, " honey with his temper, θῡμίδιον, as he is wont to mix mulled wine with his salad, θῠμίδιον."
It is thus, not as the representative of sourness, but as the recognized sauce for θυμίδιον, that σίραιον is contracted with μέλι.884. ἀκαλήφην.]
The stinging nettle:
here, of course, as the Scholiast says, μεταφορικω̑ς, τὸ τραχὺ καὶ δηκτικὸν, "the asperity of his temper.
"886. ἕνεκατω̑ν πρ
ολελεγμένων.]
These prosaic words I take to be a legal phrase, with which the dicasts would be fami­ liarly acquainted ;
"for the considera­ tions aforesaid."
The preceding sentence ἐπά̜δομεν νέαισιν ἀρχαι̑ς has the flavour of the closing scenes of the Eumenides.890.
τω̑ν γε νεωτέρων.]
Aristophanes, still quite a youth at the date of the Wasps, may possibly have wished the eulogy, which the Chorus pronounce on Bdelycleon, to be applied by the audience to himself.
After this line Meineke in­ troduces from the strophe the words 'Ιήιε Παιάν.
But such an invocation, though a very suitable close to that solemn address to Apollo, would here be totally out of place;
and it is clearly in 874 a mere ejaculation extra metrum (if not rather a stage direction), not re­ quired in the antistrophe.891. εἴ τις.]
The prayer has been said, the incense burned, the divine protection duly invoked.
And now at last the judicial proceedings commence, Bdely­ cleon as the κήρυξ or usher of the Court, first making the customary proclama­ tion.
Βδελυκλέων μιμει̑ται TOV κήρυκα, says the Scholiast.895. κύων κυδαθηναιεύς.]
The real names would be κλέων Κυδαθηναιεὺς ἐγράψατο Λάχη' Αἰξωνέα.
The change of one letter converts Laches into a name at once applicable to a dog, and descriptive of the peculation with which he was charged.
See the note on 836 supra.
Laches was in truth of the deme Æxoneis, as Mitchell observes, re­ ferring to the Platonic dialogue which bears the name of Laches.
The ques­ tion there is as to the nature of ἀνδρία (see the note on 959 infra), and Nicias says that it cannot exist without intel­ ligence;
and he therefore doilies theTo the new rule, for the aforesaid reasons.

Laches exclaims at this.
"Don't be alarmed, friend Laches," retorts Nicias, " for I don't deny the quality to you and Lamachus and many other Athenians, and I there­ fore admit your intelligence."
"Now," observes Laches, " I could make a good reply to that remark, but I won't, lest you should say that I am in very truth an Æxonian," ἴνα μή με φη̑ς ὡςἀληθω̑ς Αἰξωνέα εἴναι (alluding, I suppose, to the general character of the Æxonians, Αἰξωνει̑ς γὰρ, says Eustathius, p. 741, δημόται 'Αττικοὶ, σκώπτονται ὡς κακολόγοι).
—Laches, cap. 26. See Leake's Demi, ii. 184.
The Accuser retains the generic name of κύων, which sufficiently re­ sembles Κλέων, and no doubt (like Aris­ tophanes himself) he really belonged to the deme Cydathenæcis, of which the Scholiast on Plato's Symposium (ad init.) says, Κυδαθήνιον δη̑μος ἐν ἄστειτη̑ς Πανδιονίδος φυλη̑ς, καλει̑τατ δὲ Kat κύδα­ θον.897.
The penalty proposed by the prosecutor (see the note on 106 supra) was stated in the indictment itself.
See the example given in the note on 1041 infra.

He too enters an appearance.
The observation which follows is given by some to Bdelycleon, and by others to Philocleon, but seems rather to be a saucy interpellation of Sosias, like that in 823 supra. "
This is another Grabber," he says, referring to the signification of the name Labes:
"a famons good dog for yelping and clear­ ing the dishes."
Two years before, in a passage to which Bergler refers, the same Cleon had been described as a barking and thievish cur, κυνηδὸν Νύκτωρ Knights, 1034.
Bdelycleon now pro­ claims silence in the Court, and then directs his father to take his spat on the judicial bench, and Κύων to go up and prosecute.907.
τη̑ς μὲν γραφη̑ς.]
It must be re­ membered that (contrary to what occurs in the case of Labes infra 949) Κύων is here himself the speaker, by the mouth of Xanthias :
see 841 supra:
and doubt­ less his language is intended to repre­ sent what Bishop Thirlwall calls " the homely diction" of Cleon (History of Greece, chap. 21).
From this source, I imagine, are derived such quaint idio­ matic expressions as τὸῥυππαπαι, κατε­ σικέλιζε.
and the like.909.

Here, as elsewhere, the veil is raised for the mo­ ment, and the prisoner is Laches, and not Labes.
So again we have ἄνδρα in 918, 923, 933, πόλεων in 925, στρατιώταις in 965, and many other expressions, en­ tirely inapplicable to the dog, and ap­ plicable only to the Athenian commander.
Observe that the expression is EME καὶ τὸῥυππαπαȋ.
The grievance most pro­ minent in the Accuser's mind through­ out, is that he had himself been ex­ cluded from all share in the spoil.
See supra 896, infra 914, 923, 972.910.

He means that the peculations of Laches had been com­ mitted in Sicily, an obscure and distant region, where the eye of the Athenian People could with diffic ulty discern his proceedings.
Compare the explanation which St. Chrysostom gives of the phrase "
What I tell you in darkness," St. Matth. x. 27:
ἐπειδὴ μνοις αὐτοȋς Horn, xxxiv. 390 C. κατεσικελιζε, if not borrowed from the oratory of the real Cleon, is a word formed for the present occasion.916.
to κυνί]
In Knights, 1017, Cleon is made to compare himself to a faithful and vigilant dog, who serves the Demus his master with loud and incessant barking.
And it is in no way improba­ ble that in his actual speeches, like an eminent politician of our own day, he was accustomed to describe himself as the watchdog or Tear'em of the State.
Mitchell aptly compares Demosth.
conk Aristogit. 782, τί οὗυοὗτός ἐστι ;

τῳ̑ κοινῳ̑.]
Philocleon speaks in the name of the dicastery which repre­ sented, or rather which itself was, the Sovereign People of Athens.
Mitchell refers to Andocides, Or. ii. 3, εἰ δὲ μὴ εἶεν. " He gave nothing to me, the State dog," says Clean:
" no, nor yet even to me, the State itself," adds Philocleon, who is naturally more im­ pressed with the wrong to himself than with the hardship to the prosecutor.
There is perhaps a play on the words918.
θερμός.]
θερμὸς, as applied to the man, means " violent, lawless " (Plutus, 415):
as applied to the gruel, it seems to suggest, as Florent Chretien observes, that Philocleon has just been burning his mouth.
See Peace, 1069, and the note there.
I have translated it " scorcher " with reference to the French écorcheurs.
The Court is beginning to exhibit so very decided a bias in favour of the prosecution, that Bdelycleon, in the next line, is obliged to interpose and remind it of its judicial oath.
See the note on 725 supra.924.

But here I sup­ pose the θυεία was used as a pan or safe wherein to keep the cheese.925.
τὸσκι̑ρον.]
σκι̑ρ
ον means any in­ durated substance, especially the dry chips struck off in hewing stone:
from which cement is made, and indeed de­ rives its name, cæmentum, quasi cædi­ mentum.
It is also applied to the hard rough outside, or rind, of chcese, τὸ ῥυπω̑δες τὸ ἐπὶ τω̑ν τυρω̑ν, says the Scho- East, who quotes from the Χρυσου̑ν γένος of Eupolis a passage in which a τροφαλὶς is described as σκίρον ἠμφιεσμένη.
Xan­ thias uses the word in the latter, Philo­ cleon in the former, sense.
In my translation I have been obliged to trans­ fer the play of words from σκι̑ρον to θυεία.928.
μία λύχμη.]
The solitary habits of the robin redbreast (Erythacus rube­ cula), and the determination with which he beats off from the favourite haunts of himself and his mate any intruder of his own species.
gave rise to a proverb, which Xanthias here parodies, ἐριθάκους δύ' οὐ τρέφειλόχμη μία.
The proverbis preserved by the Scholiast.
And its accuracy is abundantly verified by modern observers.
"During the time of incubation," says Mr. Bewick, speaking of the redbreast, " the cock keenly chases all the birds of his own species, and drives them from his little settlement.
It has never been observed that two pairs of these birds were ever lodged in the same bush.
Unum arbus­ tum non alit duos crithacos."
And "in confinement," Bechstein tells us (His­ tory of Cage Birds), " lie is so jealous and unsociable that he must not have a companion, he must be quite alone;
a second would cause battles which would end only with the death of one of the combatants.
If, however, they are equal in strength, and in a large room,they will divide it, and, each taking possession of his half, they remain in peace unless one should pass his limits, in which case war begins, and is main­ tained to the last extremity."
Many anecdotes illustrating this peculiarity of the redbreast are collected by the Rev. F. O. Morris in his pleasant and instruc­ tive History of Birds.
As to κλέπτα δύο see supra 759, iufra 1227.932.
TO χρη̑μα τἀνδρός.]
With this well-known idiom (Clouds, 2;
Lys. 1031, etc.) compare the Latin Quid hoc sit hominis (Plautus, Amph. ii. 2. 137), and our old English phrase, so common in Richardson and other novelists of a past generation, "a fine figure of a man."μαγειρείῳ ἡρπάγη ὁ τμρός.—Scholiast.
No evidence was required for the prosecution, but for the defence Bdelycleon calls the various culinary articles which were present in the kitchen at the time of the alleged theft.
Lucian, who though him­ self as original and independent a genius as ever lived, is perpetually recalling and reproducing the wit of Aristophanes, must have had in his mind as well the scene before us as the address to the Lamp with which the Ecclesiazusæ commences, when he described the trial of Megapeuthes before the judgment­ seat of Rhadamanthus in the world below (Cataplus, 27).
Megapenthes is accused of divers enormities, and on his denying the truth of the charge, the Accuser offers to produce witnesses.
Lest 1 should bark, and bark, and yet get nothing.
And if I do I'll never bark again.

"Whom do you call?" demands the Judge. " Call," says the Accuser to Hermes, "his Lamp and his Bedstead," προσκάλει pot, ὧ'Ερμη̑, τὸν λύχνον αὐτου̑ καὶ τὴν κλίνην.
Hermes at once makes proclamation, " Let the Bedstead and the Lamp of Megapenthes stand for­ ward," ἡ Κλίνη, καὶ ό Λύχνος 6 Μεγαπένθους παρέστω.
And at the call they come, and first the Bedstead and then the Lamp gives oral evidence before the Court.939. πρ
οσκεκαυμένα.]
The witnesses in the present case are not προσκεκλημένα, " summoned to give evidence," like other witnesses (see the preceding note):
they are προσκεκαυμένα, as is natural for kitchen utensils, supra 828.
There is possibly a play on the two words.
Dobree proposed to read προσκεκλημένα here :
an ingenious suggestion certainly, and one which involves merely the slight altera­ tion of two letters :
but προσκεκαυμένα, which is supported by the uniform au­ thority of all the MSS.
and the Scholiast, and yields a good and apt sense, cannot be dislodged from its place, simply because another word has been discovered which would perhaps have been wither and still more apt.942.
παύσει—ὼν δύσκολος.]
Hitherto therefore the prayer expressed in 883 supra (παυσάμενον τη̑ς δυσκολίας) had not been granted.944. ἀνάβαιν', ἀπολογου̑.]
Bdelycleon puts up Labes to make his defence just as, supra 905 (ἀναβὰς κατηγόρει), lie had put up Κύων to conduct the prosecution ;
and cf. 963 and 977 infra.
But Inches, a plain blunt man, and no orator as Cleon was, is so taken aback by the charges brought against him, that he has not a word to say in his own defence.
Thereupon Aristophanes recalls the similar condition of Thucydides (the son of Melesias and rival of Pericles) when he too was put upon his defence, and was so dumb-foundered by the nimbleness and versatility of his adversary's tongue, that he lost not only his presence of mind, but his very power of speech.
The scene is described, with natural indignation, in the Antepirrhema of the Acharnians.949.

popular saying;
such (it may be) as that preserved by the Scholiast, πεζῃ βαδίζω, νεῖν γὰρ οὐκἐπίσταμαι.
Here the speaker appears to mean that Laches is a blunt rude soldier, who knows a soldier's duty, and knows no more.
And this is exactly his character in the Platonic dialogue which bears his name.
He and Nicias are there consulted about the education of two boys (Thucydides, son of Melesias and grandson of the Thucydides men­ tioned in the note on 944 supra, and Aristides, son of Lysimaclius and grand­ son of Aristides the Just), the immediate question being whether it is advisable for boys to learn the science of arms from a professional teacher.
Nicias thinks it is.
Laches thinks it is not.
He has seen, he says, that sort of gentry in actual battle, ἐναὐτῷ τῷ ἔργῳ, and remarked the ridiculous figure they cut :
Nicias may be quite right, but such at all events is his experience.
Doctors differing, the question is referred to Socrates.
Of course Socratcs must needs go to the root of the matter;
the object of education, the nature of the soul, the definition of virtue in general, and of ἀνδρία in particular.
Laches is now in his element.
0, I know what ἀνδρία is, he says:
when a man stands to his post, and beats off his enemy, that is ἀνδρία.
Socrates explains that this is no defini­ tion at all, but merely an instance, and not even a well-chosen instance, of ἀνδρία:
and by dint of cross-questioning he fairly puzzles Laches, who says, ἀήθης εἰμὶ τῶνδιέφυγεν, ὥστε μὴ ξυλλαβεῖν τῷλόγῳ αὐτὴν Kat εἰπεῖν ὅ,τι ἔστιν.
Nicias, an accom­ plished and highly-educated gentleman, rallies his friend with perhaps a greater assumption of intellectual superiority than his friend altogether likes :
but his own definition ἐπιστήμη τῶν δεινῶν καὶ θαρραλέων is presently demolished by Socrates, and Nicias himself is obliged to confess that the true definition has yet to be found.
Laches is delighted to see that Nicias fares no better than him­ self.
What not got the true definition, Nicias ?

why, when you were laughing at my answers to Socrates I made sure you had got the true defini­ tion yourself.
And ultimately he delivers his opinion thus:
I'll tell you what, Nicias, I advise our friends here not to consult you and me about the education of their boys, but to go to Socrates and to keep fast hold of him.
Throughout the whole dialogue Laches is the plain downright soldier, a man of deeds and not of words.

Written speeches were the rule, rather than the exception, in Athenian law- courts.
They were, however, speeches composed by the advocate to be repeated by the party to the suit;
and not, as Philocleon suggests to have been the arrangement here, speeches composed by the culprit (κακουργῶν) to be inflicted on the Court by the advocate conducting the case.9G2.

It conveys a touch of sur­ prise, not unmingled with expostulation, at the conduct of the person addressed, and is perhaps best represented by the intonation given to such phrases as " Pray, sir, do so and so."964.
ταμιεύουσα.]
You were the ταμίας τῶν στρατιωτικῶν, the Quæstor, the ray­ master to the expeditionary force:

Cf.Demosth.adv. Timocr. 1189, ἐπέπλει ταμιεύων Φιλίππῳ τῷναυκλήρῳ.
All this, of course, belongs to Laches, not to Labes.
The Scholiast says that Aristophanes is imitating the investigations before the Public Auditors;
see the note on 571 supra.968.
όΛάβης.]
Aristophanes is draw­ ing a portrait of Laches and Clean in the character of the Two Dogs :
depre­ dators both, κλέπτα δύο, but the one gaunt and hungry, toiling and moiling in his master's service:
the other living at home on the fat of the land, and assailing with noisy clamour all who will not admit him to a share of their plunder.973.

His feelings resemble those of Lucas Beaumanoir at the trial of Rebecca (Scott's Ivanhoe, chap. 38):

As I think.

Bruunk refers to Peace, 232, Kat γὰρ ἐξιέναι, γνώμην ἐμὴν, Μέλλει, and Eccl. 319. Richter absurdly takes the words to be the accusative after ἐπεδάκρυσα, which he supposes to mean δακρύων ἀπώλεσα.985.
χαλεπὸν εἰδέναι.]
Bdelycleon had addressed his father in the plural num­ ber (οἰκτείρατε, μὴδιαφθειρητε) as though addressing a full court, composed of many dicasts.
His father carries on the fiction, anticipating a close division ar.d professing that he cannot yet be sure on which side the majority will be found.987.
ὕστερον.]
Sc. καδίσκον or κάδον.
There were, as the Scholiast observes, two Voting Urns:
the Nearer, 6 πρότερος, was the urn of condemnation;
the Further, ὁὕστερος, was the urn of ac­ quittal.
Each dicast had one vote, and only one.
If he thought the prisoner guilty, he dropped it into Urn No. 1;
if not guilty, into Urn No. 2.
When all had voted (supra 752-4) the votes were cast out, and counted on a stone slab (supra 332):
and the majority was thus ascertained.
Phrynichus in his comedy of The Muses, which obtained the second prize when the Frogs of Aristophanes obtained the first, has a similar allusion to the two καδίσκοι,Meineke, Corn. Fragm.

contest between Sophocles and Euripides is improbable in itself and inconsistent with the language of the fragments.)
And compare Lysias contra Agoratum, p. 133.
There was, as the Scholiasts observe, another mode of voting:
where there was but one voting urn, and each dicast had two votes, a solid onefor condemnation, and a perforated one for lacquittal.
In this case the dicast dropped one vote into the voting urn, and threw aside the unused vote into a surplus urn.
But this is manifestly not the plan adopted here.
See Schömann, De Judiciorum suffragiis occultis, Opus­ cula Academica, i. 267.
There is here no trace of two votes :
and Bdelycleon plainly wishes his father to drop an effective vote of acquittal into the Fur­ ther Urn, and not merely to throw the " guilty" vote, as unused, into the surplus urn, before he has voted at all.988.
μύσας παρᾷξον.]
The old dicast is still wavering, and Bdelycleon still hopes that he may be induced to deposit his vote in the urn of acquittal.
But knowing how difficult it will be for his father to pass by the old familiar urn of condemnation, he begs him to shut his eyes, and make a dash for it.
Philo­ cleon's repartee οὐ δῆτα κ.τ.λ. is treated as a mere jest ;
and the old man does in truth consent to be led blindfold towards the urns.
Bdelycleon leads him round (compare the expression μετὰ χοιρίνης περιελθεῖν, supra 349) so as to miss Urn No. 1 altogether:
and the first urn Philo­ cleon meets is really Urn No. 2.
By the manoeuvre and ambiguous language of his son, he is made to suppose that this is Urn No. 1;
and whether he all along intended to do so, or is at the last moment unable to resist the temptation, he puts his vote iuto the ura of acquittal, believing that he is outwitting his son, and condemning Labes.989.
κιθαρίζειν.]
He is retorting Bdelycleon's saying (supra 959) on Bdelycleon himself.
I too, he means, am none of your dilettanti, but a plain, blunt Judge, not to be swayed by any sentimental considerations.
I know a Judge's duty, and I know no more.993.
πῶς ἄρ’ ἠγωνίσμεθα.]
The scene before us naturally recalls, though by way rather of contrast than of analogy, the solemn judicial voting in the Eumenides of AEschylus :
and Bergler cites the direction given there by Athene, ἐκβἀλλεθ’ ὡς τάχιστα πάλους, and her final announcement of the result, ἀνὴρ ὅδ’ ἐκπέφευγεν αἵματος δίκην.
With the present passage may be compared the anxious exclamation of Orestes, ὦ Φοῖβ’
Ἄπολλον, πῶς ἀγὼν κρι­ θήσεται ;
Not that there is any anxiety in Philocleon's mind:
he speaks with the quiet confidence of a man who knows that when the matter is brought to the test he will be found to have done his duty.
PHIL.
No, no, my boy.
I never learnt the lyre.
BDEL.
Here, let me lead you round the handiest way.
PHIL.

BDEL.
This is.
PHIL.

BDEL.
We shall soon see.
0 Labes, you're acquitted!
Why, how now, father ?
PHIL.
(Faintly) Water, give me water!
BDEL.
Hold up, sir, do.
PHIL.
Just tell me only this,
Is he INDEED acquitted ?
BDEL.
Yes.
PHIL.
I'm done for.
BDEL.
Don't take it so to heart:
stand up, sir, pray.
PHIL.
How shall I bear this sin upon my soul ?
A man acquitted !
What awaits me now ?
Yet, 0 great gods !
I pray you pardon me.
Unwilled I did it, not from natural bent.
BDEL.
And don't begrudge it;
for I'll tend you well, And take you, father, everywhere with me, To feasts, to suppers, to the public games.
Henceforth in pleasure you shall spend your days, And no Hyperbolus delude and mock you.
But go we in.

For, according to his own account (supra 160), a heavy judgment had been denounced against him, if he should once acquit a prisoner.1007.

So infra 1349, ἐξαπατήσεις κἀγχανεῖ.
You shall no longer be a prey to the demagogue who first misleads you, and then laughs at you for being misled.
The participle added to ἐγχαίνειν gives the reason for the mockery;
as in Ach. 221;
Knights, 1313, etc. On Hyperbolus see the note at Peace, 681.
Aristophanes is, for the last thule, insisting on that charge against the demagogues, which it is the main purpose of the Play to enforce, viz.
that whilst they affected to be patronizing the dicasts, they were in reality deluding them, and laughing them to scorn.
See supra 516, and passim.1008.

Now :
not before, but now :
after this crushing and unex­pected catastrophe, Philocleon finally and for ever resigns his dicastic duties.
Modern editors have destroyed the pathos by converting the expressive vvv of the MSS.
into the meaningless en­ clitic νυν.1009.
ἴτεχαίροντες.] ἴτε καὶχαίρετε, its et valete, the usual valedictory formula wherewith the Chorus dismiss the actors, whilst they themselves turn to the audience and commence the Parabasis.
τέως in this passage, as in Peace 729 (ἀλλ' ἴθι χαίρων ̇ἡμεῖς δὲ τέως κ.τ.λ.), refers to the interval whilst the actors are away.
We have here a com­ plete Parabasis, perfect in all its parts;
τῆ παραβάσεως κωμ̇ικῆς, says Pollux, iv. segm.
112, ἑπτὰ ἂνεἵη μέρη, KOULIUTLOV.
παράβασις, μακρὸν, στροφὴ, ἐπίρρημα, ἀντί­ στρ
οφος, ἀντεπίρρημα.
The Commation (1009—1014) is a short prelude, intro­ ductory to the Parabasis proper.
The Para basis proper (1015—1050) consists of thirty-six Aristophanic lines, con­ cluding with the Pnigos or Macron (1051—1059), which is defined by Pollux, ubi supra, as βραχὺ μελύδριον ἐπὶ τῇ παραβάσει, ἀπνευστὶ ᾀδόμενον, and which is here composed of ten short anapæstic lines.
These sections comprise the Address of the Poet in his own character to the audience.
The four remaining sections are concerned with the Chorus in their dramatic character.
The Epir­ rhema (1071—1090) and Antepirrhema (1102—1121), each of twenty trochaic tetrameters, explain the reasons why the members of the Chorus are represented under the guise of Wasps.
The Epir­ rhema shows that the wasp is a fit symbol of their active and martial youth:
the Antepirrhema, that it ac­ cords equally well with the altered habits of their dicastic old age.
The battle-scene of the Epirrhema comes appropriately between the Strophe (1060 —1070) and Antistrophe (1091—1101), which are two stirring strains, enume­ rating the glorious exploits of those early years.
1010.

This seems to have been a quaint phrase, very popular at Athens.
Reisig refers to Plato's Laws, vii. 801 E:

Yea, go rejoicing your own good way, Wherever your path may be;
But you, ye numberless myriads, stay And listen the while to me.
Beware lest the truths I am going to say, Unheeded to earth should fall;
For that were the part of a fool to play, And not your part at all.
NOW ALL ye people attend and hear, if ye love a simple and genuine strain, For now our poet with right good will, of you, spectators, must needs complain.1012.

The Parabasis pro­ per of the Wasps has much in common with those of the Knights and the Clouds:
and a considerable portion of it was subsequently repeated in the Para­ basis of the Peace.
The poet reviews his dramatic career, claiming credit for the honesty of his purpose, and the virtue of his Muse,—as well during the preliminary period when his productions were fathered on other poets,—as after­ wards, when with the two great Comedies already exhibited in his own name, the Knights and the Clouds, he had gone out like another Heracles to do battle with the Monsters which were laying waste the land;
first the giant Dema­ gogue, powerful and death-dealing as the fabled Typhoons, and secondly, a foe more insidious but not less dangerous, the crafty and cold-blooded school of Sophists.
That in the latter combat he was ill-supported by the popular voice, is a proof, he contends, that the people have not yet fully appreciated either the deserts of the author, or the singular excellence of that particular Play.
Scholiast.
All the poet's early come­ dies, down to and including the Acharnians, were produced in one or other of these two names.
It is common­ ly supposed that the Wasps itself was brought out in the name of Philouides;
but to my mind the entire tenor of the Parabasis is absolutely conclusive against this hypothesis, which is fully discussed in the Preface.1019.
Ερυκλέους.]
Eurycles, who is again mentioned (as Dindorf observes) in Plato's Sophista, cap. 37, was one of those wizards who were called ἐγγασ
τρί­ μυθοι, ventriloqui, because they made their voice appear to issue, not from their organs of speech, but from the lower parts of their body, as if from an indwelling spirit there.
ἐγγαστρίμυθ
ος is the name commonly applied through­ out the Septuagint, and by the Greek Fathers, to persons who had familiar spirits, such as the Witch of Endor.
The art of Eurycles was ventriloquism in its ancient and etymological significa­ tion of making your voice proceed from the depths of your own body, and not in its modern sense of making your voice proceed from the lips of others.
Aristophanes poured his ideas through the lips of Philonides or Callistratus, as the spirit poured his through the lips of Eurycles.1022.
οὐκ ἀλλοτρίων Μουσῶν.]
Other poets, he means, gained their victories with his works:
but the Plays with which he himself entered the lists were all his own genuine unassisted pro­ ductions ;
no other poets exhibited their comedies under the name of Aristo­ phanes.
In ἡνιοχήσας he is using the metaphor which is more fully developed
Ye have wronged him much, he protests, a bard who had served you often and well before ;
Partly, indeed, himself unseen, assisting others to please you more ;
With the art of a Eurycles, weird and wild, he loved to dive in a stranger's breast, And pour from thence through a strangers lips full many a sparkling comical jest.
And partly at length in his own true form, as he challenged his fate by himself alone, And the Muses whose bridled mouths he drave, were never another's, were all his own.
And thus he came to a height of fame which none had ever achieved before, Yet waxed not high in his own conceit, nor ever an arrogant mind he bore.
He never was found in the exercise-ground, corrupting the boys:
he never complied With the suit of some dissolute knave, who loathed that the vigilant lash of the bard should chide
His vile effeminate boylove.
No !
he kept to his purpose pure and high, That never the Muse, whom he loved to use, the villainous trade of a bawd should ply.in 1050 infra.
Addison might have appealed to this passage as a precedent for part of the imagery employed in his famous lines, famous for the criticism of Dr. Johnson in the Lives of the Poets, I bridle in my struggling Muse with pain, That longs to hunch into a nobler strain.
“To bridle a goddess," says Dr. Johnson, “is no very delicate idea:
but why must she be bridled ?
because she longs to launch;
an act which was never hindered by a bridle ;
and whither will she launch?
Into a nobler strain.
She is in the first line a horse, in the second a boat, and the care of the poet is to keep his horse or his boat from singing.”1021.
out:
ἐκτελέσαι ἐπαρθείς.]
Though he was ἀρθεὶς, “lifted up so high," he did not turn out, did not end by be­ coming, ἐπαρθεὶς, “lifted above himself."
His elevation did not result or issue in pride or arrogance.
The sentiment is the same as that in the epitaph by Simonides on the daughter of Hippias, ἀτασθαλίην.
—Thuc. vi. 59. ἐκτελέσαι is used intransitively, as is frequently the case with τελέω and its compounds.1025.
παλαίστρας.]
This subject of self-laudation is repeated in Peace, 762 ;
and here, as there, the Scholiast says that there is a covert allusion to Eupolis, to whom such practices were commonly imputed.1026.
ἔσπευδε.]
It was but lost labour that wealthy and dissolute Athenians strove to make interest with the poet for their abandoned associates:
he was not to be swayed by considera­ tions such as these, but kept on the even tenor of his course, praising virtue and censuring vice, no matter whom he thereby offended.
1029.
πρῶτόν γ᾽ ἦρξε διδάσκειν]
Two years before the date of the Wasps, a Chorus had for the first time been sought, and obtained, in the name of ARISTOPHANES.
He had not applied be­ fore, partly (he says) because he con­ sidered κωμῳδοδιδασκαλίαν εἶναι χαλεπώ­ τατον ἔργον ἁπάντων, Knights, 516.
Now for the first time he became a real κωμῳδοδιδάσκαλος, an avowed and re­ cognized διδάκαλ
ος τοῦ χοροῦ, or as he expresses it here, πρῶτον ἦρξε διδάσκειν.
The first Comedies which he ἐδίδαξεν, that is to say, produced in his own name, were the Knights, B.C. 424;
the Clouds, B.C. 423;
and the Wasps (see the Preface), B.C. 422.
And with this change in the nominal authorship, there came a striking change over the spirit and tone of the Aristophanic drama.
Clean and the demagogues, Euripides and the Sophists, he had already satirized, but only in a light and desultory manner.
His earlier comedies had no trace of the concentrated energy which he now displayed, wrestling (ξυσ­ τὰς, infra 1031, ὡς ἐπὶ τῶν παλαιόντων.— Scholiast) with those evil influences which were in his judgment threatening to overpower the pure and wholesome instincts of the Hellenic mind.
The Knights has been truly described as " a struggle for life or death ” between the Poet and the Demagogue.
The effect of the Clouds was as permanent as it was overwhelming, and years afterwards exercised a perceptible influence (Plato's Apology, cap. 3) in bringing about a catastrophe which the author little in­ tended, and doubtless deeply regretted.
1030.
‘Ηρακλέους.]
Just as Heracles did not pit himself against ordinary men, but purged the land of the monsters which infested it, such as the lion of Nemea, the Lernean hydra, etc.:
so Aristophanes seeks out the mightiest antagonists, and wars οὐκ ἀνθρώποις, says the Scholiast, ἀλλὰ τέρασι καὶ δαίμοσιν.
He too was an ἀλεξίκακος, a τῆς χώρας τῆσδε καθαρτής.1031.
θρασέως.]
The First of the Labours of Aristophanes (to adopt his own Heraclean imagery) consisted in his attack upon Cleon with the comedy of the KNIGHTS, a comedy to which he always looked back with peculiar satis­ faction, as being the grandest and most heroic achievement of his Muse.
He glories in the courage with which, whenWhen first he began to exhibit plays, no paltry MEN for his mark he chose, He came in the mood of a Heracles forth to grapple at once with the mightiest foes.
In the very front of his bold career with the jag-toothed Monster he closed in fight, Though out of its fierce eyes flashed and flamed the glare of Cynna's detestable light, And a hundred horrible sycophants' tongues were twining and flickering over its head, And a voice it had like the roar of a stream which has just brought forth destruction and dread,all men quailed before the savage and relentless demagogue (who makes his first appearance in history as advocating the massacre of every male in Mityleue, and is last mentioned as the author of the decree, carried into effect after his death, for the massacre of every male in Scione), he alone ventured into the lists against him, and smote him in the very plenitude of his power (μέγιστον ὄντα, Clouds, 549).
To enhance the merit of the exploit, be pourtrays his adversary in the most appalling colours, as another Typhœus, before whom Gods themselves might tremble.
The next six lines are occupied with a description of this combat.
And the whole passage is repeated, with slight variation, in the Para basis of the Peace, 751—9.
The reader is referred to the notes there.
1032.
Κύννης.]
A shameless Athenian prostitute, with whom (or rather im­ mediately after whom) Clean is made to rank himself in Knights, 765.
It is pos­ sible that Aristophanes means to suggest that Cynna inspires the truculent oratory of Clean, as Aspasia is said to have in­ spired the lofty eloquence of Pericles.
καρχαόδοντι in the line above signifies " with sharp pointed fangs," such as carnivorous animals possess.
The epi­ thet had already been applied to Clean in Knights, 1017.1033.
κεφαλαί.]
Bentley would read γλῶτται, but κεφαλαὶ is the word used by Hesiod in the description of Typhœus, to which Mitchell refers, and from which the present passage is supposed to be borrowed, The Poet means that Cleon was sur­ rounded by innumerable satellites (such as Theorus, Cleonymus, and the like, supra 45, 419, 592, etc.), who fluttered about his person, and bristled up the moment he was attacked.
The future participle οἰμωξομένων may possibly, as Mitchell suggests, be intended to convey a menace, “who shall smart for it."
But in truth, in such words as these, the future signification is, as a general rule, entirely lost.
"Est enim proprie ό κάκιστ᾽ ἀπολούμενος,” says Seiler on Alciphron, i. 37, " is qui certo pessime peri bit, qui pessime perire meretur, igitur qui alias dicitur κατάρατος.”1034.
φωνήν.]
Bergler refers to Knights, 136, where Cleon is described as Κυκλο­βόρου φωνὴν ἔχων.
See the note on 36 supra.
The expression χαράδρας ὄλεθρ
ον τετοκυίας is probably borrowed from some lyric poet of the day.1035.
φώκης δ᾽ ὀσμήν.]
The Scholiast says, εἰς κακασμίαν αὐτὸν διαβάλλει, διὰ τὸ βυρσοδέψην αὐτὸν εἶναι. “Ομηρος (Od. iv. 442) “φωκάων ἁλιοτρεφέων ὀλοώτατος ὀδμή.”
And on Λαμίας, εἰδωλοποιεῖ ὄρχεις Λαμίας.
θῆλυ γάρ.
Two thousand years ago Greek nurses were frightening their children with tales about Lamia, an ogress who would carry them off, and devour them in secret:
see note at Peace, 758.
And they are doing so still:
see Tozer's Highlands of Turkey, chap. 30.1036. καταδωρ
οδοκῆσαι.]
He was stayed neither by fear nor by favour:
no terror dissuaded him:
no bribe bought him off.
Bergler, Brunck, and Mitchell are al­ together wrong in translating καταδωρο­ δοκῆσαι dona dare, a very rare and doubtful signification of the word (see Ruhnken's Timæus sub voc.), and one which is certainly not supported either by verse 675 supra, to which Bergler refers, for there the proper reading is δωροφ
οροῦσιν:
nor by Hdt. vi. 72, to which Mitchell refers, for there, as in Hdt. vi. 82, δωροδοκεῖν obviously means not dona dare, but dona accipere.
See Knights, 66;
supra 669.1037. μετ᾽ αὐταῦ.]
Unà cum illo.
Without leaving Cleon (see the Epirrhema of the Clouds), he attacked a second foe:
he had both on his hands at once.
Bentley's suggestion μετ᾽ αὐτὰν, post illum, is founded on a misconception of the poet's position.
He had not done with Cleon when he wrote the Clouds:
he has not even yet done with him, ἔτι καὶ νυνὶ πολεμεῖ.
And few will, I think, accept Fritzsche's idea (De Socrate Yeterum Comicorum, Quæst. Aristoph. i. 117) that μετ᾽ Αὐτοῦ means unà cum ipso Socratc (Clonds, 220) discipulos aggressus est.
—We come now to the Second Labour of Aristophanes, under­ taken the year after the Knights, and the year before the Wasps (πέρυσιν), viz. his encounter with the Sophists in the comedy of the CLOUDS.
And in his own estimation, if the Knights was the most gallant, the Clouds was the loftiest and most brilliant of all his dramatic perform­ ances, Clouds, 522;
infra 1046.
Here he is dealing no longer with a towering earth-born Giant, but with a more ghastly Portent, with subtle and invisible agencies, attacking and enslaving the minds of men.
He likens them to in­ sidious and unhealthy influences, to Fevers and Agues, which cramp the nerves and sap the wholesome energies of human life.
ὤσπερ ἠπίαλοι καὶ πυρετοὶ βλάπτουσι τὰ σώματα, says the Scholiast, οὕτω καὶ οὗτοι τὴν πάλιν.
And a Lamia's groin, and a camel's loin, and foul as the smell of a seal it smelt.
But He, when the monstrous form he saw, no bribe he took and no fear he felt, For you he fought, and for you he fights :
and then last year with adventurous hand
He grappled besides with the Spectral Shapes, the Agues and Fevers that plagued our land;
That loved in the darksome hours of night to throttle fathers, and grandsires choke,ings which are premonitory symptoms of fever.
See Seiler on Alciphron, iii. 72 ;
Ruhnken's Timæus sub voc. 'Ηπίαλος, says the Scholiast, to πρὸ τοῦ πυρετοῦ δρομος."
The line is not found in either Play as now extant, and is probably taken from the second Thesmophoriazusæ.
There is perhaps also an allusion here, as Didymus, cited by the Scholiast, sug­ gests, to the spectre 'Ηπιάλης, the Night­ mare fiend, with whom long afterwards in medieval legend Saint Withold waged successful war (King Lear, in. 4). Fritzsche (De Socrate Veterum Comi­ corum ubi supra) and Bergk (on the Holcades, in Meineke, Fragm.
Coin. ii. 1113) both imagine that Aristophanes must here be recalling and reproducing the identical language of the earlier Play.
The former therefore argues that the first edition of the Clouds must have been widely different from that which we now possess;
whilst Bergk contends that Aristophanes cannot be alluding to the Clouds at all, but is speaking of some lost comedy, possibly the Holcades.
Both these theories betray a complete misapprehension of the poct's design in the passage before us.
He is giving, as it were, an allegorical representation of the combats he has waged, and the deeds he has done, as Heracles the Destroyer of Monsters.
And he depicts his an­ tagonists, not in language borrowed from his former Plays (which would have been quite inappropriate), but with entirely new imagery, specially adapted to his present purpose.
Cleon is no longer the "Paphlagonian slave" of the Knights;
he is now a powerful and angry demon, a Monster whom it requires no less than the might of a Heracles to subdue.
The Sophists are no longer the pallid disputants of the Clouds :
they are now malevolent Plagues and Pestilences, from whom it is a task not unworthy of a Heracles to purge and deliver the land.
On πέρυσιν the Scholiast says, πέρυσι τὰς1039.
πατέρας ἦγχον.]
The Scholiast refers to Clouds, 911;
Bergler to Clouds, 1376;
and Mitchell to Birds, 13-18,1352, and Eccl. 638—640.
To these references may be added Clouds, 1385, 1389.
We shall perhaps best follow the train of thought which was passing through the mind of Aristophanes by comparing Clouds, 1428, with Birds, 1348—52.
In the former passage, the young Logi­ cian, fresh from the school of the Sophists, argues that the old-fashioned notions of filial duty will not stand the test of free inquiry:
that gamecocks and the like fight with their parents;
and why should not he with his ?
In thelatter passage a parricide wishes to settle in the kingdom of the Birds, be­ cause he understands that according to their laws a child may beat his father, and he desires ἄγχειν τὸν πατέρα καὶ πάντ' έχειν.1040.
κοίταις.]
Mitchell refers to the bed-scene in the Clouds where Strepsiades is made to lie down upon the Socratic pallet, in order to put himself in the right train for devising a νοῦν ἀποστερη­ τικὸν, κἀπαιόλημα,
The scene itself was no doubt intended to form a practical representation of the Sophists, imagin­ ing mischief on their beds.
With these busy and restless intriguers were con­ trasted the ἀπράγμονες, Athenians who minded their own business, and lived peaceably with all men, disciples of the δίκαιος λόγος, who taught them ἀπραγ­ μοσύνης ὄζειν, Clouds, 1007.1041.
ἀντωμοσίας.]
Accusations on oath:
see the note on 545 supra.
The notion which modern writers have derived from Pollux, vii. segm.
55, that the name is in strictness confined to the Defendant's affidavit, is manifestly er­ roneous.
It is found much more frequently applied to the Plaintiff's, which was of course the more important of the two, as enunciating the charge which the Defendant merely traversed.
Hence it is commonly used, simpliciter, for the charge itself.
ἀντωμοσία, γραφὴ —Timæus, (Gloss. Plato,) Suidas, Scho­ liast ad h.
1. A better illustration can hardly be found than that furnished by the case of the great philosopher at­ tacked in the Clouds.
In the Apology of Plato, Socrates distinguishes be­ tween his present accusers, and those old and inveterate assailants, comic poets and the like, who for a generation past have been misrepresenting his prin­ ciples and practice. "
These," he says, "are my most formidable accusers.
Read the charge which they bring against me, ὥσπερ οὖν κατηγόρων τὴν ΑΝΤΩΜΟ­ "And charges thus made," he adds, "admit of no defence:
I am unheard:
judgment goes by default."
Then he turns to the actual charge preferred by Anytus and Meletus, αὖθις, ὥσπερ ἑτέρων δὴ ἔγκληυα τοιοῦτόν ἐστι cap. 11).
Dio­ genes Laertes in his Life of Socrates professes to give -as the very words ofThat laid them down on their restless beds, and against your quiet and peaceable folk Kept welding together proofs and writs and oath against oath, till many a man Sprang up, distracted with wild affright, and off in haste to the Polemarch ran.
Yet although such a champion as this ye had found, to purge your land from sorrow and shame, Ye played him false when to reap, last year, the fruit of his novel designs he came,φθείρων. τίμημα θάνατος (cap. 19).
In all these passages the term ἀντωμοσία means simply " the sworn indictment."
And such no doubt is its signification here.
It was of course for purposes of attack and not for purposes of defence that the Sophists were concocting, συνεκόλλων, their legal devices.
The πρόσκλησις was the writ of summons, the judicial cita­ tion, served upon the bewildered victim;
the ἀντωμοσία was the sworn indictment laid against him :
the μαρτυρία was the evidence by which the charge was sup­ ported.
1042.
πολέμαρχον.]
Why recourse should be had to the Pole march in particular, is by no means clear.
The Scholiast refers it to his special jurisdic­ tion over resident aliens, an explanation not very satisfactory, nor perhaps alto­ gether consistent with the ὑμῶν in line 1040, but I can offer nothing better.
And it may be that on some recent occasion the resident strangers had been harassed with vexatious charges of dis­ affection and treachery.1043.
ἀλεξίκακον.]
This, as the Scho­ liast on Clouds 1372, and again on Peace 422, observes, is a special epithet of Heracles, ἴδιον 'Ηρακλέους to ἐπίθετον. Thus Aristides, v. ('Ηρακλῆς), says of Heracles, αἱ ἐπωνυμίαι (καλλίνικός τε καὶ ἀλεξίκακος) ἡ μὲν μόνῳ θεῶν, ἡ 8' ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις δέδοται.
So Lucian de Gallo, ὦ ἀλεκτρύων.
So in Alciphron, iii. 47, a thievish parasite exclaims, 'Ερμῆ κερδῷε Kat ἀλεξίκακε 'Ηρακλεῖς ἀπεσώθην.
The Scholiast on Frogs, 501 (where Heracles is irreverently called οὑκ Μελίτης μαστιγίς, the gallows-bird from Melite), says that in the urban deme of Melite there was a famous temple of 'Ηρακλῆς ἀλεξίκακος.
The expression τῆς χώρας καθαρτὴς is also of course specially appropriate to Heracles.
With these words the poet concludes the comparison which he com­ menced in line 1029 supra between his own achievements and the Labours of Heracles.1044.
πέρυσιν καταπρούδοτε.] ὅτι πέρυσι διδάξας τὰς πρώτας Νεφέλας, ἡττήθη.—
Scholiast.
Last year both the Flagon of Cratinus and the Connos of Ameipsias had been preferred before his own favourite Clouds.
His disappointment is described in language borrowed from the operations of husbandry.
He had sown his very best and choicest seed, but the sun of Athenian favour did notshine upon his labours, and when he came to reap the harvest, he found the crops all blighted and withered away, ἀναλδεῖς.1046.
Διόνυσον.]
Bergler refers to the similar adjuration in Clouds, 519.
In both passages the appeal is made to Dionysus as the chief patron and critic of dramatic literature.
πόλλ' ἐπὶ πολλοῖς means "over and over again," "time after time." Cf. Knights, 411.1047. ἀμείνονα.]
That the Clouds was the cleverest (σοφωτάτη) of all his come­ dies, and the one which had cost him most thought and labour, he declares with great emphasis in Clouds, 522.
More especially does he insist on the fact that in it he was introducing a novel style of comedy, an entirely origi­ nal invention of his own, Clouds, 547;
supra 1044;
infra 1053.
This indeed partly accounted for, and excused, the temporary blindness of the audience.
It was ὑπὸ τοῦ μὴ γνῶναι καθαρῶς, that they did not at once, παραχρῆμα, appre­ ciate the peculiar merits of the new philosophic drama.
And he seems to imply that the time will soon come, if it has not already arrived, when they will fully acknowledge their mistake.
Mean­ while the poet's claims have always been recognized by those who understand the subject, παρὰ τοῖσι σοφοῖς, the tribunal to which he invariably appeals, οὐ προ­ δώσω τοὺς δεξιοὺς ὑμῶν, Clouds, 527.
Which, failing to see in their own true light, ye caused to fade and wither away.
And yet with many a deep libation, invoking Bacchus, he swears this day That never a man, since the world began, has witnessed a cleverer comedy.
Yours is the shame that ye lacked the wit its infinite merit at first to see.
But none the less with the wise and skilled the bard his accustomed praise will get, Though when he had distanced all his foes, his noble Play was at last upset.

It was not the superior swiftness of his competitors that van­ quished him;
he was outstripping them, when his chariot broke down under one of those τύχαι θραυσάντυγες so common in Hellenic chariot-races.1056.
κιβωτούς.]
Wardrobes, chests.
"In men's houses," says St. Chrysos­ torn (Hom. xxxii. in Matth.
373 D), "the κιβώτιον contains changes of raiment;
in the House of God it contains alms for the poor."1057. μήλων.]
That is, I suppose, citrons, μῆλα Περσικὰ or Μηδικά.
For in old times citrons were very commonly placed in wardrobes, to preserve the clothes from moths and the like.
Theo­ phrastus (Hist. Plant. iv.
4) says of the citron, τὸ μῆλον οὐκ ἐσθίεται μέν, εὔοσμον Athenæus (iii. 26) adds that even to recent days men were in the habit of laying up citrons ἐν ταῖς κιβωτοῖς μετὰ τῶν ἱματίων.
Pliny (Nat. Hist. xii. 7) says,"odore præcellit foliorum,qui transit in vestes unà conditus, arcetque anima­ lium noxia."
And Macrobius (Saturn, ii. 15) quotes Oppius as saying de citreo, " est autem odoratissimum;
ex quo inter­ jectum vesti tineas necat."
He also cites the phrase "citrosam vestem" from Nævius, and adds (but this is question­ able) that in Homer θύον means the citron, and εἵματα θυώδεα clothes so scented and preserved.1060.
ὦ πάλαι.]
The Pnigos, so called because the speaker was expected todeliver it in one rapid unbroken run, with­ out pausing to take breath (see the note on 1009 supra), terminates with the word δεξιότητος;
and the Chorus now turn from the poet's affairs, and speak of themselves in their own dramatic character, recall­ ing in the strophe, epirrhema, and anti­ strophe, the long-past glories of their youth.
The Scholiast refers to the pro­ verb (twice repeated in the Plutus) πάλαι ποτ' ἦσαν ἄλκιμοι Μιλήσιοι;
and Florent Chretien (apud Bergler) to the famous triplet sung at Spartan festivals, "Αμμες πόκ' ἦμες ἄλκιμοι νεανίαι κ.τ.λ. (Plutarch, Lycurgus, cap. 20), which may be roughly and imperfectly rendered as follows :
OLD MEN.
We once were strong and mighty men of war.
MEN.
You once were strong and mighty, BUT WE ARE.
BOYs.
But we'll one day be stronger, mightier far.1062.
τοῦτο.]
The pronoun is used, as Seager observes, δεικτικῶς, the speaker pointing to the sting, which, as he is about to explain, is neither more nor less than the symbol of the Μαραθωνο­ μάχαι.
In the MSS.
and the early editions the last word of this line was written μαχιμώτατοι, which does not accord with the metre ;
and Bentley proposed to substitute either ἀλκιμώτατοι or ἀνδρικώ­ τατοι.
The former word, which was in­ dependently suggested by Person, is generally adopted, is slightly nearer the MS.
reading, and is more consonant to the two preceding lines:
yet ἄνδρες ἀν­ δρικώτατοι as applied to wasps would be in the genuine Aristophanic vein:
see infra 1077, 1090.
In the deadly battle throng,And in this, our one distinction, manliest we, mankind among !
Ah, but that was long ago :
Those are days for ever past:
Now my hairs are whitening fast, Whiter than the swan they grow.
Yet in these our embers low still some youthful fires must glow.
Better far our old-world fashion, Better far our ancient truth, Than the curls and dissipation
Of your modern youth.
Do YOU wonder, 0 spectators, thus to see me spliced and braced,1068.
τοὐμὸν γῆρας.]
We veterans of the Persian war must show what we can do :
for old as we are we count ourselves of greater value than a whole shoal of your modern youths, with their curls and their immoralities.
1071.
The Epirrhema contains a de­ scription of the battle of Marathon, a scene which was always present to the mind of Aristophanes, as exemplifying the generous self-devotion, the I'an­ hellenic heroism, of Athens in days gone by.
Nor is the description unworthy of the theme.
Even AEschylus, the soldier­ poet, as M. Villemain truly observes in his Essai sur la poésie lyrique, has left us no nobler reminiscence of the Persian wars than the battle scene before us, a strain instinct with the spirit and fire of Tyrtæus.
It is probable that the History of Herodotus had just been given to the public;
and Aristophanes has caught not only the tone, but the very phraseology, in which the story of the two Persian invasions is told iu that great prose epic.
The dicasts are.
through­ out the Play, represented as the sur­ vivors of the Persian war;
but in making them actually present at the battle of Marathon, sixty-eight years before the date of the Wasps, Aristophanes (as is frequently elsewhere his practice) is treating his Chorus as types rather than as individuals, and attributing to them actions in which they could personally have taken no part.
"Soletenim comicus," as Bergler remarks at Lys. 665, " choro senum tribuere qum longe antecesserunt ætatem illorum homiuum."
Meineke, contrary to all authority and probability, omits the sixth line of the Epirrhema, and the fourteenth of the Antepirrhema, so reducing each system to 19 lines:
but in fact these systems invariably consist of an even number of lines:
usually 16 (Acharnians, Knights twice, Peace, Birds twice, Thesmophoriazusæ);
20 here and in the Clouds and the Frogs.1073.
ἣτις.]
So Bentley and the later editions, rightly.
ἣτις depends upon διδάξω, and Hirschig appropriately refers to 519, 520 supra, δίδαξον ἣτις ἠ τιμή 'οτί σοι.
The old reading was ἢ τις, supposed to depend on θαυμάζει.
For ἐπίνοια, the meaning, cf. Peace, 127.1074.
κἃν ἃμουσος ᾑ τὸ πρἰν
They are adapting one of the many Euripidean γνῶμαι which seem to have made an immediate impression on the popular mind, and to have passed at once into general currency, as proverbial sayings.
The passage in question occurs in his Sthenobœa (Wagner, Fragm.
Poet. Trag. ii. 664), Μουσικὸν 8' ἃρα "Ερως διδάσκει κἆν ἃμουσος ᾑ τὸ πρίν.
Love will make a man a poet, Though lie were unskilled before.
See Bentley (Epistle to Mill), who cites the various passages in which allusion is made to these lines.
Plato (Symp. 196 E) puts a manifest reference to them into the mouth of Agathon, πᾶς.
γοῦν ποιητὴς γίγνεται κἆν ἃμουσος. ᾖ TO πρὶν, οὖ ἃν "Ερως ἃψηται.
They are thrice cited by Plu­ tarch (de Pyth. Orac. 405 r;
Quæst. Symp. 622 c;
Amator. 762 B), and are found in other writers.1076.
ἐγγενεῖς αὐτόχθονες.]
Thecherished belief of the Athenians that they were the indigenous population of Attica, γηγενεῖς.
αὐτόχθονες, sprung from the soil, Lysistr. 1082 (like snails and grass­ hoppers, said Antisthenes the Cynic, bitterly, Diog. Laert. vi. 1. 1), furnished an additional incentive to their efforts in defence of their native land, a land which they regarded not as a step-mother or adopted parent, but as the very mother who bare them.
Plato (Menexenus, cap.
6) eulogizes her dead warriors as men who had not lived as strangers in a strange country, ἀλλ' αὐτόχθονας καὶ τ
ῷLike a wasp in form and figure, tapering inwards at the waist ?
Why I am so, what's the meaning of this sharp and pointed sting, Easily I now will teach you, though you " knew not anything."
We on whom this stern-appendage, this portentous tail is found, Are the genuine old Autochthons, native children of the ground ;
We the only true-born Attics, of the staunch heroic breed, Many a time have fought for Athens, guarding her in hours of need;
When with smoke and fire and rapine forth the fierce Barbarian came, Eager to destroy our wasps-nests, smothering all the town in flame, Out at once we rushed to meet him :
on with shield and spear we went,ἐπὶ τῷ τοὺς νέους καταπλήττεσθαι.
—Scho- East.
The narrative which Herodotus gives of the battle of Marathon (vi. 112, 113) is fall of similarity, verbal and otherwise, to the description before us.1079.
καπνῷ τύφων.]
He uses language applicable to the smoking-out of wasps, supra 457.
With πυρολῶν Bergler aptly compares Hdt. viii. 50, ἐλήλυθεν θαι. Cf. Id. viii. 53 :
ix. 13. Herodotus is speaking of the Second invasion, when Athens was actually committed to the flames:
but no doubt the same fate would have awaited her in the First, had her citizens been defeated at Mara­ thou.
The first armament had been despatched for the special purpose of wreaking the Great King's vengeance on the audacious little Republic which had dared to defy his power (Hdt. vi. 94);
and its track across the Ægean had been marked by the flames of burn­ ing cities and temples, and all the horrors of slavery (Hdt. vi. 96,101).
The acci­ dental similarity of sound makes ἀνθρή­ νια a very happy substitute for 'Αθήνας.1081.
εὐθέως γὰρ ἐκδραμόντες.]
So eager were they to meet the foe, that they left the city, and issued out against him :
so eager, when they met him, were they to attack, that contrary to all Hellenic precedent they charged at a run:
οἰ 'Αθηναῖοι, says Herodotus, vi. τοὺς ἃνδρας ταύτην ἐσθημένους.
So rapid was their advance, that according to Justin (ii.
9) the invaders had not even time to discharge their arrows, before the Athenians were upon them, " citato cursu ante jactum sagittarum ad hostem venerunt."
The expression σὺν δόρει σὺν ἀσπίδι is repeated in Peace, 357.
Thespear was the representative weapon of the Hellenic, as the bow of the Oriental combatants.
See infra 1084.1082.
θυμὸν ὀξίνην.]
Always ὀξύθυμοι (see the note on 1105 infra), they were now more so than ever:
they had imbibed, as it were, an extra draught of pugna­ city.
But there is also beyond a doubt, as Florent Chretien saw, an allusion here to wasps which had sipped (πεπω­ κότες) the dew from the pungent thyme ;
a play on the words θυμὸς and θύμος, see the note on 87S supra.1083.
χεύνην.] χελύνη, τὰ — Hesychius.
It means either lip indiffer­ ently;
for the words TO ἃνω χεῖλος in Suidas are manifestly nothing more than an explanation of the phrase τὴν ὑπερᾡαν χελύνην which he is citing from Theophylact, and which of itself is sufficient to show that χελύνη standing alone does not necessarily signify the upper lip.
Here I suppose it refers principally to the under lip.
Bergler cites Homer, Od. i. 381, ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες:
Tyrtæus, ii. 22 (Gaisford's Poetæ Minores Græci), χεῖλος ὀδοῦσι δακὼν, and Eur. Bacch. 621, χείλεσι διδοὺς ὀδόντας.1084.
τοξευμάτων.]
The bow was the national weapon of the Persians (ἠ μάχη μὐτέων ἐστὶ τοιήδε, Toga καὶ αἰχμὴ βραχέα, Hdt. v. 49. τόξα μεγάλα, ὀἲστοὺς δὲ καλαμίνους, Id. vii. 61, and elsewhere) :
and from their fifth to their twentieth year they were trained especially to acquire three accomplishments, viz. to ride, to use the bow, and to speak the truth (Hdt. i.136).
Their broken arrow- heads are still found in the sandy soil which forms the great barrow over the Marathonian dead:
see the note on 711 supra.
And the battle-scene is graphi­ cally depicted in Childe Harold, ii. 90, as The hying Mede, his sliaftless broken how, The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear.
Aristophanes is referring, as the Scho- East observes, to the famous dialogue which took place before the fighting commenced at Thermopylae:
when the Trachinian declared ὡς, ἐπεὰν οἰ βάρβαροι ἀπιέωσι τὰ τοξεύματα, τὸν ἢλιον ὺπὸ ToO πλήθε
ος τῶν ὀἲστῶν ἀποκρύπτουσι, and the Spartan merely rejoined, " That is well;
we shall, fight in the shade."
See Hdt. vii. 226.1085. ἐσπέραν.] "
That evening was introduced into the scenery of the Athe­ nian recollections of Marathon, just as the Aurora and Hesperus sculptured on the column of Trajan in his Forum at Rome, enter into the representations of his victories, being the symbols of times of day in which those victories were achieved.
The hour of the day combined with the local bearings of the plain ofFought the memorable battle, primed with fiery hardiment ;
Man to man we stood, and, grimly, gnawed for rage our under lips.
Hah !
their arrows hail so densely, all the sun is in eclipse !
Yet we drove their ranks before us, e'er the fall of eventide :
As we closed, an owl flew o'er us, and the GODS were on our side!
Marathon may have conduced much to the success of the Athenians.
The sun would then have streamed in full dazzling radiance, so remarkable in the sunsets of Greece, on the faces of their adversaries, and against it the conical tiara of the Persians would have offered little pro­ tection."—"Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. vi. πρὸς ἐσπέραν, towards evening.1086.
γλαῦξ.]
To an ancient Athenian the apparition of a γλαῦξ, the little steely-eyed owl of Pallas, was the best of all possible auguries.
And even a modern Athenian expects good luck, if one of these birds chance to settle on his house, Dodwell's Tour, ii. 44. The Scholiast says that this harbinger of victory did actually appear to the army at Marathon, φασὶ δὲ κατὰ τὸἀληθὲς γλαῦκα διαπτᾶσθαι., τὴν νίκην τοῖς 'Αθηναἰοις ἐπ­ αγγέλλουσαν.
And Plutarch records a similar tradition with respect to the naval engagements in the straits of Salamis, λέγεται ὑπό τιων—γλαῦκα ὀφθῆ­ —Themist.cap.12.
The effect which such an omen, occurring on the eve of conflict, might be expected to produce on the Hellenic mind is strikingly illustrated by the device which Agathocles employed before fighting his first battle on the soil of Africa.
Observing that his soldiers were despondent and down­ hearted, he let loose a number of γλαῦκες to fly amidst the camp :
the troops be­ lieved that they beheld a visible symbol of the divine presence :
they awaited the onset of the enemy with cheerful alacrity:
and to this stratagem the historian at­ tributes in great measure the successful result which ensued.
'Ορῶν δὲ τοὺς Diod.
Sic. xx. 11. But on no minds would Athene's symbol exercise so power­ ful an influence as on those of Athene's people, especially in this hour of peril.
The national tradition ascribed to the national goddess no inconsiderable share in the glories of the day:
and her figure.
together with that of Heracles, the local Marathonian hero, occupied a con­ spicuous position in the battle frescoes of the Pœcile (Paus. i. 15).1087.
θυλάκους.]
This word, which properly meant sacks or bags, was used contemptuously to designate the loose wide trousers (slops) then, as now, worn by Orientals.
Their real name was ἀναξυρίδες.
ἀναξυρίδας. ἒχοντες ἒρχονται [οἰ βάρβαροι] ἐς τὰς μάχας.— Hdt. v. 49;
vii. 61, etc.
They may still be seen pictured on the frieze representing the battle of Marathon, which formerly belonged to the Temple of Victory, and is now in the British Museum.
See Leake's Athens, ii. 226, note.
The Athenians can deride the ἐσθῆτα Μηδικὴν now, but the mere sight of it used, before the battle of Marathon, to strike terror into the hearts of their forefathers.
See the note on 1081 supra.
The Scholiast ex­ plains θυννάζοντεςto mean κεντοῦντες ὠς τοὺς θύννους τοῖς.
τριόδουσι, μεταφορικῶς tridente in eos jacto, Pliny, ix. 20. Bergler refers to the corresponding simile in Æsch.
Persæ, 424.
With the following line compare Clouds, 946.1090. ἀνδρικώτερον.]
Aristophanes is fond of applying this epithet to objects other than ἃνδρες.
It is used of a cock in Birds, 1349;
of Lysistrata, in Lys. 1108;
of the women generally in Thesm.
656, and so on.
And see supra 1077.1091.
πάντα μὴ δεδοικέναι.]
This is certainly a somewhat quaint mode of saying that the speaker was afraid of nothing :
and Hirschig's πάντας ἒμε δεδοικέναι would express an equivalent idea, in very much simpler language:
and cf. Knights, 1112.
But the reading in the text is supported by the uniform authority of all the MSS.;
and the mere singularity of an expression affords no sufficient ground for suspecting its genuineness ;
especially in lyrical pas­ sages such as these, where Aristophanes is, as often as not, adopting some popularStung in jaw, and cheek, and eyebrow, fearfully they took to flight, We behind them, we harpooning at their slops with all our might;
So that in barbarian countries, even now the people call Attic wasps the best, and bravest, yea, the manliest tribe of all !

πλέων ἐκεῖσε.]
Sailing thither, that is, to the country τῶν ἐναντίων, not (as in the battle just described) awaiting their onset here.
They are now revert­ ing to the second stage of the Persian war, to those scenes of adventure in which they are, throughout the Play, represented as having borne a part:
when the tide of Oriental invasion had been finally rolled back, and Hellenic triremes, under the leadership first of the Spartan king, and then of Aristides, Cimon, and other illustrious Athenians, were in their turn crossing the Ægean, and attacking the Persians at home.
The result of their expedition is accu­ rately summed up in the following lines, viz. (1) we captured many cities of the Medes;
and (2) we obtained the φύρος for Athens.
It was in fact for the pur­ pose of this counter-invasion that the Athenian confederacy was first organized, and the φόροςassessed by Aristides :
see the note on 657 supra.
And with its aid the towns which Persian garrisons yet held on the coasts of Thrace and the westerly shores of Asia Minor were successively captured.
and the neighbour­ hood of the Ægean freed from the pre­ sence of the foe.1097.
ἐρέτης ἂριστος.
Rome may see in this statement another point of re­ semblance (in addition to those noticed by Mr. Disraeli in Lothair) between the education of an ancient Athenian, and that of a modern English gentleman.1098.
Μήδων.]
Such were Byzantium (supra 236) and the cities of Cyprus Μήδων ἐχύντων, Thuc. i. 94).
Such was Eion (Hdt. vii. 107. 'Ηϊόνα Μήδων ἐχύντων στρατηγου̑ντος, Thuc. i. 98), memorable for the self-devotion of the Persian governor.
Cimon, says Plutarch (Cimon, cap. 12), left the Persians no time to breathe and recover themselves, but following close after them as they drew off from Hellas, τὰ μὲν ἐπόρθει καὶ κατε­ μω̑σαι.
After his death, continues his biographer (cap. 19), the Hellenes did no great deed against the barbarians, but, impelled by demagogues and dis­ turbers of the peace, wasted their strength in intestine conflicts.
It is per­ haps hardly necessary to observe that the terms " Mede" and " Persian " were em­ ployed indifferently by Hellenic writers to designate their Eastern antagonist.

The contrast between the former generation who garnered in for Athens her imperial revenue, and the present generation who waste and mis­ apply it, is again enforced in Lysist.

Here the speaker is alluding to the disclosures which Bdelycleon had made, supra 657-666, etc.1100.
κλέπτουσιν See supra 554.
The dishonesty of Athenian officials had become a byword:
charges of peculation are everywhere brought against them in Athenian literature.
I will merely cite the playful badinage which passed be­ tween Xenophon and Cheirisophus, whilst the Ten Thousand were retreat­ ing through the snows of Armenia.
The generals are in consultation about stealing a march, and occupying by stealth the side of a mountain pass, and Xenophon is explaining how he thinks it can best be done, when he suddenly checks himself and says, " But why do I give an opinion about stealing, ἀτἀρTherefore did we batter down many a hostile Median town.
And 'twas we who for the nation Gathered in the tribute pay, Which the younger generation Merely steal away.
You WILL find us very wasplike, if you scan us through and through, In our general mode of living, and in all our habits too.
First, if any rash assailant dare provoke us, can there be Any creature more vindictive, more irascible than we ?
Then we manage all our business in a waspish sort of way, Swarming in the Courts of Justice, gathering in from day to day,Spartans, I understand, are trained to steal from your youth up:
now then show your training, and steal a march without being caught and beaten."
"Ay, ay," replies Cheirisophus, " but I too have heard say that you Athenians are wondrous handy at stealing public property, δεινους κλἐπτειν τἀ δημὀσια, and the best of you steal the most, if so be that your leaders are the best of you:
so you had better show your training, I think."

The Epirrhema taught us that the stinging wasp was no unfit emblem of the Chorus in their fiery and aggres-
Rive youth, when they turned to flight the armies of Persia.
The Antepirrhema is designed to show that old and feeble as they have now become, there is yet much in their dicastic life and habits to remind the observer of that irritable and gregarious insect.

The same epithet is applied to the dicasts supra 406, 455, and they are styled σφη̑κες ὀξυκάρδιοι supra 430.
And compare θυμὀν ὀξίνην supra 1082, and the note there.
In his famous panegyric on the Areopagus (Eum. 674), AEschylus describes that tribunal as being
They who with Stanley, Blomfield, and others translate the words εἴ τε δημόθρους άναρχία βουλήν καταρρίψειεν (Æsch. Ag. 802), si consilium projectum inirent (in­ stead of si senatum dejicerent), on the ground that there would have been no senate at Argos in Agamemnon's time, must surely have forgotten that, in writing the Trilogy, the mind of Æschy­ lus was possessed with an active political purpose, viz.
the support of the βουλὴ of Areopagus against what was in his view δημόθρους ἀναρχία.
As to δύσκολον, see the note on 1356 infra.1108.

Groups of dicasts might be seen in the early morning, wending their way along the streets of Athens in the direction of their several places of business.
Four snch places are specified here:
(1) Where the Archon is, supra 304.
Unless this refers exclusively to the Archon Eponymus (which is hardly probable), it would seem to comprehend all the ten ordinary dicasteries ;
each of which had for its president one of the Nine Archons, or their official secretary.
The remaining localities appear to be­ long to special tribunals, summoned for special purposes.
(2) To the Eleven.
These officers were at the head of the police arrangements at Athens.
To them, as to our sheriffs, belonged the custody and execution of condemned criminals.
(Plato's Apology, cap. 27. Phædo, cap. 65, etc.)
And- cases of theft, highway robbery, kidnapping, and the like were under their peculiar juris­ diction.
Suidas s. v. ε̃νδεκα says, 'Αρχὴ καὶ οἱ ἀνδραποδισταί.
And it seems that unless the culprits pleaded guilty, a court of dicasts was summoned to try them in the Parabystus under the superintendence of the Eleven, ἡ τω̑ν —Scholiast.

Phrastor had put away Strybele (Neæra's daughter), and thereupon Stephanus, as her guar­ dian or next friend (κύριος), brings against him an action of this description.

There seems no reason to suppose that this was one of the ten ordinary dicasteries.
See Fritzsche, De Sortitione Judicum, p. 85. (4) By the Walls:
that is, either the Long Walls or the walls of the city.

Hauptmann de Andocide, cap. viii. (apud Reiske's Ora­ tores Græci, vol. vii. p. 601), applies them to a Theseum near the Long Walls;
but we have in fact no materials for deciding the point.
And it is possible that Aris­ tophanes may be referring not to any individual court, but generally, to courts at the extremity of the city;
for the purpose of showing, as the Scholiast remarks, that dicasts and dicasteries pervaded Athens everywhere.

The Chorus have al­ ready explained that the κέντρον is the symbol of veteran warriors who had served their country in the days gone by.
And they now suggest that the dicastic pay and privileges ought to be confined to deserving citizens such a-, these, and ought not to be extended to idle drones who wear no sting, that is to say, who have never toiled (οὐ ταλαιπωρούμενοι, supra 967) or fought in the service of Athens.
Such seems to me the meaning ot the passage, and I cannot accede to the view propounded by the Scholiast, and adopted by every commentator, that under the figure of drones the Chorus are describing the demagogues.
In my judgment they are speaking of persons who receive the pay in the character of dicasts :
see infra 1121.
The comparison of idlers living on the industry of others with the drones of the hive is common in every literature.
The Scholiast citesHesiod, Op. 302, and Mitchell refers to the elaborate allegory of Plato in the eighth Book of the Republic.
See also Ruhnken's Timæus sub voc.
The par­ ticiple ἐγκαθήμενος is intended to denote the lazy indolence ofthe drone.

Not that there is here any allusion, as some have imagined, to the great north wind which nearly sixty years before shattered the ships of Persia on the coasts of Thessaly (Hdt. vii. 188).
As in line 11 supra, it is merely the phraseology, and not the incident, which is borrowed from the Persian wars.1126.

There seems to be an allusion to the philosophic distinction between the ξύμφορον and the ἀγαθὸν, the utile and the bonum.

Athenæus (vii. 137), after observing that these little fish were dressed with ἅλμη, and citing some lines of Aristophanes on the sub­ ject—the passage is quoted in the note on 329 supra—proceeds as follows :
ὡς καὶ insertion of δὶς, and the substitution of ἅλμηνπιὼν for ἐμπλήμενος, would certainly give a smoother sense:
but the reading is not supported by any Aristophanic MS.
Possibly a line may have dropped out of the text between 11£7 and 1128.1130.

καυνάκην.]
The καυνάκης was a soft warm Persian robe, which, though new to Philocleon, was probably not un­ common in luxurious establishments.
It was a sort of thick woollen wrapper used indiscriminately for a dress (Pollux. vii. segm. 58—60), a coverlet to be spread over a banqueting couch (Id. vi. segm. 11), or a bed-covering (Id. x. segm.
12:
3, σισύραι).
One side of it was rough and shaggy with locks of wool.
Hence Hesychius defines καυνάκαι as being στρώματα ἢ ἐπιβόλαια έτρομαλλη̑.
And the grammarian Palamedes (cited by the Scholiast) says, καυνάκης c'art Περσικὸν Arrian (Anab. vi. p. 436, ed. Blanchard) describing the sepulchre of Cyrus at Pasargadæ says that the coffin lay upon a bier with καυνάκας πορφυρου̑ς by way of ύποστρώματα.

I am quite unable to find (with Bergk in Meineke's Fragm.
Corn. Græc. ii. 970) a " manifest allusion" in this passage to a (real or supposed) embassy of Morychus to Ecbatana.
It is the luxurious warmth of the robe, and not its Persian origin, which reminds the speaker of Morychus, the most luxurious man in Athens.
1144.
κρόκης χόλιξ.]
χόλικες are the large intestines of cattle;
τὰ παχέα ἒντερα Hesychius.
The rough shaggy excres­ cences, or tufts of wool, which jut out on one side of the καυνάκης (see the note on 1137) arc to Philocleon's eyes just like these χόλικες βοω̑ν, and he inquires whether in that old Median capital they really use intestines of wool.

ἐριώλην.]
If it consumes all that wool, observes Philocleon, it ought to be called not καυνάκης, but ἐριώλη, wool­ destroyer, as if from ἒριον and ὂλλυμι.
ἐριώλη of course really means a hurricane (Knights, 511), and has no etymological connexion with ἒριον.1154.

The κρεάγρα was a flesh-hook which they struck into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot, (1 Sam. ii. 14) to bring up the meat.
The Scholiast on Knights, 772, describes it as shaped like a hand with the fingers slightly curved, and says it was called άγρεύειν καὶ ὰνασπᾳ̑ν.
In 1 Sam. ii. 14 the κρεάγρα seems to have been a three­ pronged fork.
Philocleon expecting to be dissolved in the great heat of his καυνάκης, hopes that there will be a κρεάγρα in readiness, to fish him out, like a piece of meat from a boiling caldron, before he is quite gone.

Λακωνικάς.]

Scholiast, Suidas.
They were red shoes of an elegant make, very fashionable at Athens.
Agathon is introduced wear­ ing them, in Thesm.

Λακωνικὰς, Eccl. 345, 508. Critias (ap. Ath. xi. 66) says that they were the best of all shoes.
Hesychius sub voc. identifies them with the Amyclaides;
and this is probably correct, though Pollux (vii. cap. 22) in enumerating the different ύπο­ δημάτων inserts the Laconians and Amyclaides separately, 'Αμυκλαἲδες , έλευ­ θεριώτατον ύπόδημα, and farther on αἱ δὲ11 60.

Aristophanes is doubtless here, and probably also in lines 1163 and 1167 infra, adapting Euripidean phraseo­ logy.αύτὸν τὴν χώραν. — Scholiast.
Rather, Philocleon speaks of the soleam Laconi­ cam, as if it were the solum Laconicum.1169.

Bdelycleon gives a speci­ men of the fashionable swagger.
In διασαλακώνισον there is, as Bergler pointed out, a play on the word λάκων.
Wear your Λακωνικὰς so as (not λακωνίζιν but) σαλακωνίζειν, to show yourself off with a fashionable strut.
διασαλκώνισον is rightly explained by the Scholiast
The term σαλάκων is frequently employed by Aristotle to convey the idea of vulgar ostentation.
1172.

The old man puffing himself out under his Persian robe, which he wears τριβωνικω̑ς, is likened by his son to a boil with a garlic plaster on it.

Nothing is known of this anecdote :
that it was of a legendary character is plain from Bdelycleon's re­ tort.1182.
οὒτωποτ' η̐ν.]
This, as the Scholiast observes, was the recognized mode of commencing a tale, like our “ Once upon a time,” οἶοv, η̐ν οὒτωγέρων καὶ γραυ̑ς.
And he refers to Plato, Phæ­ drus 2:
37 n, where Socrates, constrained by Phædrus to invent a talc, begins, 'Ην καλός. “
Once upon a time there lived a very beautiful boy, or rather youth."
So in Lysistrata, 784, the men proposing to tell a nursery legend commence, Οὒτως η̐ν νεανίσκος Μελανίων τις.
The Latins commenced their nursery tales with Olim.
Thus in Horace, Satire ii. 6. 79, the old neighbour, full of his anilcs fabellas, sic incipit, " Olim Rusticus urbanum murem mus paupere fertur Accepisse cavo."1183. Οεογένης.]
Theogenes or Thea­ genes, a man of known swinishness (ὑηνία, Peace 928), must be supposed tobe reproving the low-bred scavenger for saying ordoing before good company things which Theogenes himself was noted for saying or doing under other circumstances, 0 vulgar brute, what, before gentlemen !
The Scholiast says, θεογένης οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ 'Αχαρνεὺς, ὸν καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ μεγάλα ἀποπαρδει̑ν κωμῳδ

He is to talk of the special missions or θεωρίαι in which he has borne a part, missions sent out with all possible splendour and magnifi­ cence to represent Athens at the great Pan-Hellenic games, and on other solemn occasions.
Here the more immediate allusion is to the θεωίαι sent from time to time to Olympia.
See infra 1382, 1387.
These missions were composed of the wealthiest, noblest, and most respected citizens, who strained every nerve to make an appearance creditable both to themselves and to the state, in the presence of assembled Hellas.
See the account of the θεωρίαι conducted by Nicias to Delos (Plutarch, Nicias 3);
and by Alcibiades to Olympia (Thuc. vi. 16).
It is therefore merely by way of irony, or παρὰ προσδοκίαν, that for the other members of the θεωρία
Aristophanes suggests the names of Cleisthenes and Androcles:
the former one of the poet's most constant butts for his degraded effeminacy:
the latter (according to the Scholiast) satirized by the comedians as a slave, a pauper, and a cutpurse.
δέον αὐτὸν threw ἐπίσημα ὀνόματα, says anotherRating the scavenger, what!
would you tell Tales of a cat and mouse, in company !
PHIL.
What, then ?
BDEL.
Some stylish thing, as how you went With Androcles and Cleisthenes, surveying.
PHIL.
Why, bless the boy, I never went surveying, Save once to Pares, at two obols a day.
BDEL.
Still you must tell how splendidly, for instance, Ephudion fought the pancratiastic fight With young Ascondas :
how the game old man Though grey, had ample sides, strong hands, firm flanks, An iron chest.
PHIL.
What humbug!

Fight the pancratium with an iron chest!
BDEL.
This is the way our clever fellows talk.
But try another tack:

PHIL.

—Scholiast.
Two obolsa day formed the regular pay of an Athenian soldier, two obols for pay, and two for provisions (Boeckh, Public CEc. ii. 22).
And therefore, even if Philocleon is re­ ferring, as M. Boeckh supposes (Id. ii. 12), to an actual θεωρία, and not rather, as the Scholiast intimates, to an idle and barren military promenade, yet I imagine that he means to represent him­ self, not as one of the θεωροὶ themselves, but as one of the common soldiers who formed their escort.
There is probably an allusion to some event with which we are now unacquainted.
With this short dialogue Bergler compares the similar and very humorous passage in Lucian's Timon, 50.1191.
'Εφουδίων.]
We shall hear of this wrestling and boxing match again, infra 1383.
αὐτίκα means for instance, as very frequently in Aristophanes.1195.
θώρακ'.]
Bdelycleon speaks of the breast, but Philocleon understands him of the breastplate, the word θώραξ admitting of either signification.
The Pancratiast fought unarmed, without even wearing the cestus.liast.
Cf. infra 1291.1203.
νεανικώτατον.]
It is contrary to the entire tenor of the Play to suppose that Philocleon's youth had been spent in litigation:
but Aristophanes sacri­ fices consistency in order that he may play on the double meanings of διὡκειν (to sue or pursue, see Clouds, 1296) and αἱρεῖν (to catch or obtain a verdict against).
νεανικώτατον again, which in Bdelycleon's question had signified high­ spirited, Philocleon takes in its literal sense of youthful:
and he accordingly recounts his earliest success at law in a prosecution of Phayllus, the well-known runner (δρομἐα recalling ἔδραμες in 1204), for abusive language.1206.
φάὒλλον.]
Phayllus was a fa­ mous runner and leaper.
In the Achar­ nians (210) the old charcoal-burner laments the loss of the activity which he displayed in youth, " Running with Phayllus with a hamper at my back" (Frere).
This Phayllus was an Olympian victor (Scholiast at Ach. ubi supra), and must not be confounded with the illus­ trious Crotoniate, who alone of the Italian colonists came to the aid of Hellas in her hour of danger from the Persians.
The Crotoniate Phayllus was indeed τρὶς Πυθιονίκης (Hdt. viii. 47), but 'Ολυμπιάσιν οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ νίκη (Paus. Phoc. is. 1). See Valcknaer at Hdt. 1. c.Was when I stole away Ergasion's vine-poles.

In a fragment of Diphilus, to which Bergler refers, a parasite observes that when he goes out to dinner, he does not spend his time in gazing at the rooms or the ornaments, but keeps his eye fixed upon the kitchen chimney, to guess from the smoke which issues thence whether he is about to enjoy a good and substantial dinner. . (Athenæus, vi. cap. 29).
But these are the manners of a parasite:
Philocleon is learning the manners of a fashionable guest.
The present passage is cited by Athenæus, v. cap. 6 (to which Florent Chretien refers), καὶ' Αριστοφάνης ἐν Σφηξὶ, be says, ποιεῖ TOV ἄγριον γέροντα καὶ φιλοδικαστὴν καταρρυθμιζόμεν
ον εἰς βίον ἤμερ
ον ὑπὸ τοῦ παιδὸς, " Παῦ' ἀλὰ " κ.τ.λ. citing lines 1208, 9), διδάξας τε αὐτὸν ὡς δεῖ κατακλίνεσθαι ""Επειτ' ἐπαίνεσον" κ.τ.λ. (citing lines 1214, 5).
And he shows that the behaviour of Telemachus and Peisistratus at the court of Menelaus (Odyssey, iv. 43) was the behaviour of finished gentlemen, in entire conformity with the rules here laid down.
1215.
κρεκάδια.]
This word does not occur elsewhere;
and as it is not ex­ plained by the grammarians, we are leftto guess at its meaning.
Three deriva­ tions have been suggested:
(1) κρέξ.
The Scholiast says, κρὲξ, ὄρνεον παραπλή­ σιον γεράνῳ, and Dindorf supposes κρεκά­ δια to mean " ornamenti genus quoddam avi illi simile."
(2) κρέκειν in the sense of striking out a sharp sound.
Bergler translates it crepitacula, Voss tintina­ bula, others instrumenta musica and the like.
(3) κρἐκειν in the sense of weaving.
Cf. κρόκης χόλιξ supra 1144.
Brunck understands it " de aulæis sen velis, quibus aula tarn ornatûs gratiâ, quam arcendo vento, pulveri, aut si quid aliud nocere poterat, obtendebatur."
And this is the simplest, most probable, and most generally accepted interpretation.1216 ὕδωρ κατὰ χειρός.]
Bdelycleon is going in pantomime through the cere­ monies of a dinner party.
A very simi­ lar, but much lengthier, description is quoted by Athenæus (xv. 1) from the Laconians of Plato Comicus.
ὕδωρ κατὰ χειρὸς was the ordinary Attic expression for the wash before meals, as ἀπονίψασθαι for the wash after meals.
Aristophanes the grammarian, says Athenæus ix.
76, is very severe upon those who are igno­ rant of this distinction, παρὰ γὰρ τυῖς νίψασθαι.
So too the Scholiast here.1218.
ἐνύπνιον.]
Philocleon fears that the banquet on which he has been rec­ koning is to be a mere make-believe feast, like that of the Barmecides in the Arabian Nights, ἐνύπνιον, in a dream;
cf. Plato, Theætetus, cap. 43, (ὄναρ ἐπλουτή­ σαμεν.
The tables are now removed, the δεῖπνον is over, and the συμπόσιον begins.
Cf. supra 1005.
At these drinking parties, αὐλητρίδες were invariably pre­ sent;
and they are constantly so de­ picted in ancient vase paintings.
See Becker's Charicles, Excursus on Sym­ posia.
We shall have an example of this custom farther on:
infra 1368.1219.
οἱ συμπόται.]
There are four couches;
Cleon aud Theorus on one;
the unnamed guest and Acestor on a second:
whilst Æschines, Phanus, and the two speakers occupy the others.
Of Clean and his faithful Theorus, and of Æschines 'the son of Sellus;
we have already heard in the earlier scenes of the Play.
Phanus is mentioned, as Bergler observes, in Knights, 1256 ;
but here he is a mere lay figure to whom no furtherHo !

allusion is made.
The words ξένος τις ἕτερ
ος are perhaps intended to convey an imputation upon Acestor as being him­ self of foreign extraction.
Bergler refers to Birds, 31, νόσον νοσοῦμεν τὴν ἐναντίαν1222.
σκόλια.]
We now come to a little scene which possesses considerable interest as illustrating the principle on which scolia were sung at an Athenian symposium;
a subject on which much light has been thrown by Colonel Mure, Greek Literature, Book iii.
2. 13. The singer who led off took in his hand a lyre, a sprig of myrtle or of laurel, or other badge of minstrelsy, sang his scolium, and then passed on the badge to any guest he might choose.
The guest so selected had to cap the first scolium, that is to say, he had to sing a second scolium which he could link on to the first by some catchword, similarity of thought, aptness of repartee, or the like.
Then he handed on the badge to a third, who in like manner was bound to produce a scolium which would fit on to the second:
and so on, so that ultimately the whole series of scolia was strung to­ gether on some principle of continuity.
Hence σκόλιον δέχεσθαι means to cap a scolium, to carry it on by fitting it with an appropriate sequel.
The nature of the entertainment is well illustrated by Colonel Mure from the various scolia preserved by Athenæus, xv. 50.
In such a scene as the present, the connecting links would for obvious reasons be less complete:
but even here they are not altogether imperceptible.
In the first pair of scolia the exact adaptation to Cleon of the repartee οὐχ οὖτω ye πανοῦρ­ γος ὡς σὺ κλέπτης dispenses with the necessity of any further link ;
but in the second couple φίλον takes up the catch­ word λει,and in the third κἀγὼ follows upon κἀμοί.1223.
Διακρίων.]
If this reading is correct, the meaning must bo that Philocleon was a noted scolium-singer among the Diacrians or Highlanders, the poorer of the three parties into which Attica was divided in the days of Solon and Peisistratus :
the others being the Pedieis or wealthy Lowlanders, and the Parali or Coastinen.
The Scholiast,both here and on Lysist.
58, says that Pandion, in distributing Attica amongst his three sons, gave τὴν χώραν τὴν Διακρίαν to Lycus, the hero of the law-courts ;
see supra 389, 819.
And Fritzsche (De Sortitione Judicum, p. 35) considers that it is for this reason that Philocleon ranges himself amongst the Diacrians.
1225.
'Αρμοδίου.]
So. μέλος or σκύλιον.
Aristophanes frequently alludes to this famous scolium, "the sword in myrtles drest;
" see Acharnians, 980, 1093 ;
Lysist.
632, and the fragment of the Pelargi cited by the Scholiast on 1239 infra (ὁ μὲν ᾖδεν 'Αδμήτου λόγον πρὸς μυρρίνην, ὸ 8' αὐτὸν ἠνάγκαζεν 'Αρμοδίου μέλος).
Four stanzas belonging to it are given by Athenæus in his great collection of scolia (xv. 50):
See Tlgen's Scolia, p. 47;
Kidd's Dawes, p. 664;
Fritzsche de Pelargis (Quæst. Aristoph.),p. 50;
Colonel Mure, ubi supra.
It is observable that the line sung by Cleon, οὐδεὶς πώοτ' ἀνὴρ ἔγεντ'
'Αθήναις, which is undoubtedly a genuine quota­ tion from the scolium, is not found in the stanzas preserved by Athenæus;
but it is plain that the scolium was not one consecutive poem, bnt a loose collec­ tion of stanzas, any one of which might be taken or omitted at pleasure;
likeBDEL.
I'll put you to the proof.
Suppose I'm Cleon.
I'll start the catch Harmodius.
You're to cap it.
(Singing) “ Truly Athens never knew "PHIL. (Singing) “
Such a rascally thief as you.”BDEL.
Will you do that ?
You'll perish in your noise.
He'll swear he'll fell you, quell you, and expel yonVivien's rhyme in the Idylls of the King, which " lived dispersedly in many hands, And every minstrel sang it differently."
Even the four stanzas given by Athenians are clearly not intended to be sung con­ secutively;
they are in reality separate scolia on the same subject, and are so treated by Ilgen, Kidd, and Mure, ubi supra.
The metrical system is one in which scolia were very fre­ quently composed.
No less than seven of the scolia collected by Athenæus (in addition to the four stanzas of Harmo­ dius) are in this identical metre;
and one of them, as Tyrwhitt observed, is imitated by Aristophanes in Eeclesia­ zusæ, 938—945.
It was in order to bring the lines in the text into their real metre that Bentley in the first line changed ὲγένετ’
Αθηναȋος into ἒγετ’
’Αθή­ ναις, and in the second inserted the words ὡς ϭύ.Fritzsche (de l'elargis, p. 51) thinks that in the actual scolium the second line may probably have run οὐχ οὕτωγτπόλει καλὸςπολίτης,but I doubt if we can safely found any inference of the kind on the blunt repartee of Philo­ eleon :
and the Scholiast says, οὐδὲν6οὐδείς.]
Clean, surrounded by his friends and flatterers, leads off with a scolium which he expects to be turned into a graceful compliment to himself.1228.
βοώμενος.]
The old dicast, in lifting up his voice to give a specimen of his musical powers, has produced a series of harsh and discordant sounds, which his son describes as “ bellowing " rather than singing, and which, however suitable to a meeting of Diacrians, would hardly befit the fashionable company into which Bdelycleon is proposing to introduce him.
Such, in my opinion, is the true explanation of βοώμενος.
But many commentators, thinking the term more applicable to the μιαρὰφωνὴ of Cleon (see the note on 36 supra), have had recourse to divers expedients to make it apply to him.
Some put a colon after παραπολεȋand connect βοώ­ μενος with the succeeding line;
whilst Fritzsche and Enger (at Thesm.
995) suppose βοώμενος to be used in a passivo sense, and to mean “you will be roared down."
In my judgment neither of these suggestions is admissible.
And the vehement invective of Cleon is suf­ ficiently indicated by the reiterated menaces of the next two lines.
1232. ὦνθρωπ’.]
The Scholiast says that these lines are borrowed from Alcæus, where, however, the first word appears to have been not ὧνθρωπ’, but the more complimentary ὧνερ.
See also the Scholiast on Thesm.
162. The lines are Æolic pentameters, which commence with two syllables of any quantity (ἀδιά­ ἥ πυρρίχιον, Hephæstion, cap. vii:
here a spondee in each case), and proceed with four dactyls, the last syllable of each line being, as usual, ἀδιάφορον, sometimes long and sometimes short.
The whole of the 29th Idyll of Theocritus (which, indeed, some critics ascribe to Alcæus) is in this metre.
As applied to Cleon, the lines, I suppose, must mean that Athens is already reeling from the blow which was dealt her at Delium, and that Cleon's ambition in aspiring to the great and important command of the expedi­ tion despatched to recover Amphipolis (see the note on 62 supra) might, as in fact it did, occasion her a still greater calamity.
1236.
πρὸς ποδῶν.]
Tanquam canis, says Richter:
forgetting that Hellenic banqueters did not sit on chairs with their feet on the ground, but reclined on sofas with their feet put up.
πρὸς ποδῶν merely means sitting next below on the conch, just as πρὸς κεφαλη̂ς in 1221 supra means sitting next above on the couch.
The πόδες I take to be the feet of Clean, not of Philocleon;
ad pedes Cleonis, not ad pedes tuos, as the words are generally translated.
Theorus is sure to be close to Clean (πλησίον αὐτη̂ς, see the note on 42 supra);
and indeed the expression Κλέωνος λαβόμενος πη̂ς δεξια̂ς implies that they were re­ clining next each other.
Out of this realm.
PHIL.
Ay, truly, will he so ?
And if he threaten, I've another strain.
“ Mon, lustin’ for power supreme, ye'll mak’
The city capseeze;

What if Theorus, lying at his feet, Should grasp the hand of Cleon, and begin, “ From the story of Admetus learn, my friend, to love the good.”
How will you take that on ?
PHIL.
I, very neatly, “ It is not good the fox to play, “ Nor to side with both in a false friend's way."
BDEL.
Next comes that son of Sellus, Æschines, Clever, accomplished fellow, and he'll sing “ 0 the money, 0 the might,iambic and this also is a very common metre for scolia.
In Athenæus, xv. 50, it is em­ ployed in five other scolia besides the present. “
The Athenians had a seolion or eatch which they used to sing παρ’ olvov, over a glass of wine, Aristophanes, Wasps, 1238;
Athenæus, xv. 50.
The measure of it is neglected in the vulgar Athenæus,but is like that in Alcæus and Horace, Nullam, Vare, sacrâ vite priusseverisarborem(Carm. i. 18).
Μηδὲν ᾰλλοφυτεύσης πρότερον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω (Ath. x. 35).”
Bentley's Phalaris, xii. Eustathius on Iliad, ii. 711, says, ὰπὸδὲ τοῶ ’Αδμήτου ὰρχὴδὲ του̂αὕτη (he then cites the two lines as above).

Possibly, however, the compari­ son is between the conduct of Heracles and that of Pheres.

The Scholiast on Lysist.
1237 describes her as a ποιήτρια Λακωνική.
Nothing is known of the incident to which the lines refer.
The scolium is again mentioned by Aristophanes in the Lysistrata, εἰ μέν γέτις ἄ̜δοι Τελαμῶνος Κλειταγόρας ἄ̜δειν δέον (1237), and appa­ rently in much the same manner by Cratinusin thc Chironcs, Κλειταγόραςἄ̨δειν ὂταν’Λδμήτου μέλος αὐλῃ̂.
See the Scho­ liast on 1233 supra.
The metre may be indifferently described as consisting either of a dactyl and a cretic, or else of a choriamb and an iamb,1248.
διεκόμπασας.]
διεκόμπασας,which is Tyrwhitt's emendation for the un­ metrical διεκόμισας of the MSS., is in substance adopted by every recent editor.
It has the effect of bringing the line into the commonest of all scolium- metres, that of ὥσπερ ‛Αρμόδιος κ’’Αρισ­ τογείτων.
And in truth Æschines is rarely mentioned except to be ridiculed as a Κομπαστής.
See the note on 325 supra.
The Scholiast explains the pas­ sage as follows, τοῦτο, φησὶν, πρὸς TO σκολιονΑὶσχίνου, ἐπε ὶΚΟΜΠΑΣΤΗΣ ἧν.
And Suidas (s. v. σεσελλίσαι) says, ἀπὸ προσποιεȋσθαι πλουτεȋν.
Meineke’s further alteration of δὴ διεκέμπασας into vq
Δἲ ὲκόμπασας is also very happy and inge­ nious;
but the διὰ in διεκόμπασας seems intended to imply that they boasted "in rivalry " " one against the other," a very usual meaning of διὰ in compounds (see the note on 1481 infra);
and, besides, δὴ διεκόμπασαςwould have been far more easily corrupted into the δὴ διεκόμισας of the MSS.

It seems that at these picnic dinners each guest brought a basket of provisions, not as a contribution to the general stock, but for his own consump­ tion.
And Socrates, we are told, per­ ceiving on one such occasion that some guests had brought an insufficient supply, and others overmuch, took the insufficient supply, and divided it amongst the whole party.
By this device he shamed the others into dividing their provisions also, so that all the guests shared alike (Xenophon, Mem. ii. 14).1254. πατάξαι καὶ βαλεȋν.]
Doubtless Philocleon's judicial experience had taught him that offences such as these were the common result of a riotous wine-party ;
and we shall see by-and-by that his apprehensions in the present case were amply justified by the event:
see infra 1422.
Half a century before, Epicharmus, in those irregular rollicking verses, in which, as in so many other points, he was closely imitated by Plan­ tus, had described in a similar manner, but with greater minuteness of detail, the evil effects which flow from drinking (Athenæus, ii. 3):
A. Out of a sacrifice comes a feast;
Out of a feast come wine and drinking.
B. Drinking!
that's a jolly good thing.
A. Out of drinking revelry comes, and out of revelry rioting;
Out of rioting comes a lawsuit, out of a lawsuit condemnation ;
Thence come tines and fetters, and thence come sores, nud gungrene, and ulceration.
1259.
Αἰσωπικόν.]
Accordingly Philo­ cleon does, in a later scene, make use of two fables of Æsop and two from Sybaris;
but instead of employing them, as his son intends, for the purpose of making matters pleasant, and bringing about the Horatian conclusion, Solventur risu tabulæ, tu missus abibis (Sat. ii. 1. 86), he selects them with the express design of adding insult to injury.
As a rule, the genuine Æsopian fable seems to have concerned itself with the lower animals (the Scholiast here says, περὶ τῶν τετραπόδων ἦσαν, which is too narrow a definition);
whilst the Sybaritic fable dealt mostly with the every-day occur­ rences ofhuman life;
περὶ τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων, says the Scholiast.

The Actors again retire from the stage, and the Chorus come forward with a series of remarks, which, although not in the ordinary form of a Parabasis, yet apparently partake of the Parabatic style and character;
ό ποιητὴς ταῦταλέγει ἀπὸπροσώπου τοῦ Χοροῦ, says the Scholiast, παραβατικὰ δὲ τὰμελύδρια.
The opening strophe (so to call it), wherein they muse on the σκαιότης of Amynias, consists of five catalectic trochaic tetrameters, one tro­ chaic dimeter, and four iambic lines.
δεξιὸς is “right-handed,” "dexterous," clever;
" σκαιὸς, “ left-handed,” “ awk­ ward," "gauche."1267. ἀλλ’ ’Αμυνίας.]
σκαιός μοι Scholiast.
Amynias was an effeminate Athenian fop'(Clouds, 692), noted for his long hair, whence his name appears as part of the compound κομηταμυνία supra 466, and whence also he is here described (perhaps with an allusion to the real deme Κρωπίδαι) as οὑκ τῶν Κρωβύλου, one of the Topknot tribe.
κρωβύλ
ος was a mode of wearing the hair, which was strained back on either side of the head, so as to form a pointed tuft at the top.
See the Scholiast on Thucydides, i. 6.A jest from Sybaris, or one of Æsop’s, Learned at the feast.
And so the matter turns Into a joke, and off he goes contented.

Often have I deemed myself exceeding bright, acute, and clever, Dull, obtuse, and awkward never.
That is what Amynias is, of Curling-borough, Sellus’ son ;
Him who now upon an apple and pomegranate dines, I saw At Leogoras's table Eat as hard as he was able, Goodness, what a hungry maw !
Pinched and keen as Antiphon.
It would seem that either by his expen­ sive habits, or possibly by gambling (supra 74), he had lost all his wealth, and while still retaining his foppish appear­ ance, was reduced to actual penury.
For­ merly he had lived an epicure among epi­ cures;
now he must put up with such meagre and insufficient fare as an apple and pomegranate:
formerly he was rich as Leogoras, now he is poor as Antiphon.
Such is the state to which his σκαιότης has brought him.
The Scholiast ob­ serves that Amynias was really the son of Pronapus (supra 74), ὁγὰρΣέλλος οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῦ πατὴρ, ἀλλ’ Αἰσχίνου· ἴνα οὖνκαὶ τὸν’Αμυνίαν καὶτὸν Αἰσχίνην κωμῳδήσῃ ώς πένητας, τοῦτοεἶπεν.
See the note on 325 supra.
My translation hardly indicates with sufficient precision the true point of the satire.

Leogoras, the father of the orator Andocides, was a well- known epicure.
Κωμῳδεῖται ώς γαστρί­ μαργος ύπὸΠλάτωνος ἐν Περιαλγεῖ, says Athenæus, ix. 37. The passage to which Athenæus refers is cited by the Scholiast on Clouds, 110 (the last line seems to be a parody upon some philosophic de­ scription of the Olympian divinities) :
1270.
’ΑντιΦῶν.]
Some needy and disorderly guest;
see infra 1301.
The name was by no means an uncommon one ;
and it is quite impossible to believe that Aristophanes is here alluding, as Florent Chretien suggests, to the illus­ trious Rhamnusian, the son of Sophilus, the orator and politician whose character is given in Thucydides, viii.
08.1271.
πρεσβεύων. ]
The Scholiast (both here and on Clouds 691) intimates that this mission is an historical fact, and was mentioned by Eupolis in his Comedy of the Cities.
At a later period we hear of political intrigues carried on with the Penestæ, who were the villein race of Thessaly, corresponding to the Helots of Laconia.
But in the present pas­ , sage their name is probably introduced merely for the sake of the joke, and for the purpose of comparing the Penestæ of Thessaly (τοῖς Πενέσταισι τοῖς θετταλῶν) with that larger class of Penestæ or paupers, of which Amynias was a pro­ minent member.1275.
ὦμακάριε.]
The next eight lines are each composed of three pæons and one cretic, compare Acharuians, 971—999.
Their subject is very similar to that of the supplemental Epirrhema in Knights, 1274—1289.
Automenes had three sons;
the two elder of remarkable skill in their respective professions..
The first, Ari­ gnotus, was a harper well known (οὐδεὶς ὄστις οὐκἐπίσταται, says Aristophanes, Knights 1278, with an allusion to his name ’Αρίγνωτος, unconsciously followed in my translation here) and much esteemed;
for the Scholiast on the Knights is evidently in error iu suppos­ ing that Aristophanes is speaking ironi­ cally.
The second was a skilful actor, whose name has not come down to us.
The third was Ariphrades, no less re­ markable than his brothers, though in a very different way:
his inventive genius was displayed in discovering new methods of bestiality, for which Aristophanes attacks him here, and more plainly in the Knights and the Peace (885).
YetOnce he travelled to Pharsalus, our ambassador to be, There a solitary guest, he Stayed with only the Penestæ, Coming from the tribe himself, the kindred tribe, of Penury.
Fortunate Automenes, we envy your felicity;
Every son of yours is of an infinite dexterity :
First the Harper, known to all, and loved of all excessively, Grace and wit attend his steps, and elegant festivity :
Next the Actor, shrewd of wit beyond all credibility :
Last of all Ariphrades, that soul of ingenuity, He who of his native wit, with rare originality, Hit upon an undiscovered trick of bestiality :
All alone, the father tells us, striking out a novel line.
Some there are who said that I was reconciled in amity,he is said to have been a pupil of Anax­ agoras, who was satirized for having trained up such a man as ’ΑριΦράδην τὸν ἀδελΦὸν ’Αριγνώτου τοῦ κιθαρῳδοῦ, Athe­ naeus, v. 62.
Both here and in the Knights,Aristophanes brings the de­ graded character of Ariphrades into deeper relief, by contrasting his accom­ plishments with those of his brothers.
All three were σοΦοὶ, quick-witted (σοΦώ­ τατον, σοΦὸν, θυμοσοφικώτατον, but they in liberal and ingenuous arts, he in arts of which it is a shame even to speak.
The Scholiast says that the expression κιθαραοιδύτατος (harper of harpers) was used in the Χρυσοῦν γένος of Eupolis.1284.
εἰσί.]
The irregular Epirrhema (if the verses relating to Automenes and his sons can properly be styled an Epir­ rhema at all) consisted of nine lines, eight pæonic lines, and one trochaic tetrameter :
the so-called Antepirrhema consists of eight lines only, seven pæonic and one trochaic tetrameter.
One pæonic line is therefore missing.
Nor is this all.
The Scholiast suggests, and the suggestion has met with general acceptance, that no fewer than eleven lines (comprising the entire Antistrophe and the first line of the Antepirrhema) have fallen out of the text.
And itwould seem that in the days of the old Greek grammarians, the MSS.
marked a lacuna here.
Bergk (in Meineke's Fragm. Corn. ii. 938) conjectures that the lost Antistrophe contained an attack upon Cleon, and so was introductory to, and softened the abruptness of, the Antepirrhema:
but this would hardly be in accordance with the usual charac­ ter of these systems.
1285.
Κλέων.]
The general nature of the incident to which these lines refer is plain enough.
Some attack had been made by Cleon upon Aristophanes, who, finding that he did not receive from the people the support which he had ex­ pected, deemed it necessary to wriggle out of the scrape, in a somewhat undig­ nified manner, by patching up a hollow truce with his powerful and dangerous opponent.
Beyond this we are quite in the dark :
we know nothing ofthe details of the transaction, nor even at what period or under what circumstances it occurred;
and the Scholiasts admit themselves to be equally destitute of all information on the subject.
One of Fritzsche’s Aristophanic tracts, He injuriis Aria­ tophuni a Cleone illatis commentatio (Quæst. Aristoph. i. 301), is devoted to the task of proving that Aristophanes is here speaking of his old trouble with Cleon some four years previously, ante­ rior to the date of the Acharnians.
I do not see that he at all makes out his case;
and it is, I believe, the almost universal opinion that the poet is referring to some fresh onslaught made upon him by Cleon after, and in consequence of, the performance of the Knights.
And although this view is equally incapable of proof, it seems to me on the whole more likely to be correct.
1286.
ἀπεδειρόμην.]
I was being scourged, as ἐξέδειρα supra 450, and fre­ quently elsewhere.
But here, I imagine, both in this word and in ἔκνισε, there is a special reference intended to the tan­ ning trade of Cleon.
1287.
κεκραγότα. ] Bergk (in Meineke, Fragm. Com. ii. 937) considers that this participle must have been intended to apply to Cleon, qui vociferatione et cla­ more plurimum valebat;
but it is more generally, and I think more reasonably, referred to Aristophanes himself.
Indeed the pronoun με, though contrary to the metre, is actually inserted in the best MSS.
οὑκτὸς (oi ἐκτὸς), they that were without, the bystanders.
When upon me Cleon pressed, and made me smart with injury, Currying and tanning me :
then as the stripes fell heavily Th' outsiders laughed to see the sport, and hear me squalling lustily, Caring not a whit for me, but only looking merrily, To know if squeezed and pressed I chanced to drop some small buffoonery.
Seeing this, I played the ape a little bit undoubtedly.
So then, after all, the Vine-pole proved unfaithful to the Vine.

ὑπό τι.]
An expression very commonly used in the sense of somewhat;
as for example in Plato's Phædrus, 242 D, εὐήθη καὶ ὑπό τι ἀσεβῆ,with a little dash (soupçou) of impiety in it, and Gorgias, 493 c.
In a note on this line, Person observes that the expression occurs else­ where (alibi), and collects several passages (including those cited above) wherein it is found:
Hippocrates, Prædicta, vol. i. p. 166, Ed. Kuhn.
TO καυματώδεα ῥίγεαὑπό τι ὀλέθρια, “ feverish chills are somewhat fatal;
" Id. de morbis vulgaribus, vol. iii. 532, &c.
It seems hardly credible that a recent German editor (Richter) should so totally have misunderstood the mean­ ing both of Aristophanes and of Porson, as to state, apparently with approbation, and at all events without disapprobation, “ Porsonus ad v. VERTIT alibi :
idem correxit Ath. xv. 693 B." For πιθηκίζειν, to play the monkey, i. e. to wheedle, fawn upon, cajole, of.
Thesm.
1133;
Knights, 887;
and compare ἀλωπεκίζειν supra 1241.
It is plain that the πιθηκισμὸς of Aris­ tophanes consisted, not as Dindorf strangely supposes, in the diversion of his satire, the year after the performance of the Knights, from Cleon to Socrates, but in the wiles and trickcries with which, at the time of the dispute, he managed to disarm the resentment of his adversary.1291.
ή χάραξ.]
A proverb used in reference to persons who find the sup­ port, whereon they trusted, giving way in the hour of need.
But who is here the Vine-pole, and who the Vine ?
Ac­ cording to the common interpretation of the passage, Cleon is the Vine;
he had relied upon the feigned submission of Aristophanes, which was but a broken reed.
But to me it seems more probable that Aristophanes means to represent himself as the Vine, deceived by the faithless Vine-pole, that is, by the Athe­ nian people.
The popular sympathy, to which he had trusted for support against the machinations of Cleon, had played him false when the actual danger came.
He is alluding not, as Dindorf seems to think, to the defeat of the Clouds, but to the careless indifference, or rather the undisguised amusement, with which the Athenians had beheld him in the toils of his powerful opponent.1292.
ἰὼχελῶναι. ]
Xanthias enters hurriedly, to announce the strange pro­ ceedings of Philocleon at the feast.
We shall find him making a precisely similarentry for a precisely similar purpose, infra 1474.
See the note on 1341 infra.
The idea of this first line is developed from 429 supra.
In the next line τέγους, which is Bentley's somewhat bold con­ jecture for ἐμαῖς, is adopted by all recent editors without a dissentient voice.
1296.
στιζόμενος.]
Compare the ex­ pression "varius virgis" in Plautus, Mil. Glor. ii.
2. 61. But there is here, I doubt not, an allusion to the well- known practice of branding a runaway slave, δραπέτης ὲστγμένος, Birds, 760:
cf. Frogs, 1511;
Lys. 331.
I am branded like a runaway slave, says Xanthias, with marks from my master's stick.1297.
τί δ’ ἔστιν, ὦπαῖ.]
This seems to be a parody on some utterance of Euripides.
A very similar couplet, as Bergler remarks, is addressed by the women in Thesm.
582 to the effeminate Cleisthenes, How now, my child ?
for we may call thee child, So soft and smooth and downy are thy cheeks.
1301.
‟Ιππυλλος.]
These persons are selected, for a by-stroke of satire, as drunken and riotous paupers.
On An­ tiphon see 1270 supra.
Lycon, after­ wards one of the accusers of Socrates (Plato, Apol. cap. 10;
Diog. Lacrt.
So-Thrice lucky for the case upon your ribs :
How well and cunningly your backs are roofed With tiling strong enough to keep out blows :
Whilst I, I'm cudgelled and tattooed to death.
CHOR.
How now, my boy ?
for though a man be old, Still, if he's beaten, we may call him boy.
XANTH.
Was not the old man the most outrageous nuisance, Much the most drunk and riotous of all ?
And yet we'd Lycon, Antiphon, Hippyllus, Lysigtratus, Theophrastus, Phrynichus;
But he was far the noisiest of the lot.
Soon as he'd gorged his fill of the good cheer, He skipped, he leapt, and laughed, and frisked, and whinnied, Just like a donkey on a feed of corn :
And slapped me youthfully, calling Boy !
Boy !
So then Lysistratus compared him thus :
Old man, says he, you’re like new winefermenting, Or like a sompnour, scampering to its bran.crates, cap. 18), was at present chiefly notorious on account of his own poverty, and the unexampled profligacy of his wife Rhodia, who is accordingly, in the Lysistrata, singled out as the first vic­ tim to be sacrificed to the vengeance of the men :
“we’ll burn with fire the sex accurst, but Lycon’s wife we’ll burn the first," Lysist.
270, and the Scholiasts there and on Plato ubi supra.
Meineke’s objection (Fragm. Corn. ii. 131) to the statement in the latter Scholiast (πένης, is based on an insufficient consideration of the passage before us.
We have already met with Lysistratus and his jests, supra 787.
That he was as desti­ tute of means as of character is intimated in Acharnians, 855;
Knights, 1266 ;
and infra 1312.
Phrynichus cannot be iden­ tified with any known personage of that name:
and Hippyllus and Theophrastus do not seem to be mentioned elsewhere.
It was not to “ scurvy companions" such as these that Bdelycleon has been proposing to introduce his father:
his aim throughout has been τὸν Φύσαντα σεμνοτέρ
οις κατακοσμῆσαι πράγμασι, infra 1472;
and this inconsistency furnishes an additional argument for the theory advanced in the note on 1341 infra.1310.
ἀχυρῶνας.]
Alluding to a well- known proverb, preserved by the Scho­ liast, ὄνοςεἰς ἀχυρῶνα ἀπέδρα, " the ass ranaway to its bran.”
For κλητὴρ see the notes on lines 189 and 1408.
Both similes imply that Philocleon was (as we say) above himself, carried away by his excitement into all manner of ex­ cesses.
1311.
πάρνοπι.]
Philocleon's counter- similes are aimed at the shabby and threadbare appearance of the hungry jester.
In the first, three incongruous images appear to be blended together:
(1) a locust (no inapt representative of a parasite), a pest common throughout Hellas, and which though smaller than the Eastern locust was almost equally destructive (Dodwell's Tour, i. 215);
(2) a fig-tree, shedding its leaves;
and (3) the worn and tattered remnant of a scanty cloak.
Sthenelus, the object of comparison in the second simile, was a tragic actor, who had recently been com­ pelled by his poverty to sell the very σκευὴν τραγικὴν by which he earned his livelihood.1315.
ὡς δὴ δεξιός.]
The phraseology implies a sarcasm on the affectation of Theophrastus in seeking to pass himself off as “a superior person."
Nothing is known of him save from this passage;
but it is evident that Aristophanes is giving his own opinion of the guests, through the lips of Philocleon.
The Scholiast explains διεμύλλαινεν to mean τῷ πράγμαι.—Scholiast.
Quite inappro­ priate to the matter in hand.
But lie shrieked back,
And you, you're like a locust
That has just shed the lappets of its cloak, Or Sthenehis, shorn of his goods and chattels.
At this all clapped, save Theophrast;
but he Made a wry face, being forsooth a wit.
And pray, the old man asked him, what makes YOU Give yourself airs, and think yourself so grand, You grinning flatterer of the well-to-do?
Thus he kept bantering every guest in turn, Making rude jokes, and telling idle tales, In clownish fashion, relevant to nothing.
At last, well drunk, homeward lie turns once more, Aiming a blow at every one he meets.
Ah !
here he's coming;
stumbling, staggering on.
Methinks I'll vanish ere I'm slapped again.1326. ἄνεχε, πάρεχε.]
Philocleon comes in, tipsy and mischievous, with a torch in his hand (τῃ̑ δα̣δì, 1331, 1390), or, it may be, a torch in each hand (μετὰ λαμ­ ἕρχεται, Scholiast;
τάσδε τὰς δετὰς, 1361).
He is followed by a small crowd, composed wholly or partially of the συρπόται, whose party he has broken up, find whose αὐλητρίδα, Dardanis, he has stolen away.
As he enters, he utters certain short ejaculations of dubious import, which seem to have been the customary cries at the torch races of the Gerameicus:
see the Scholiast on Enrip.
Troades, 308.
In the Troades, ubi supra, Euripides introduces Cassandra with a torch in her hand, uttering similar ejaculations.
And the Scholiast here remarks that everybody considered the entrance of Philocleon in the Wasps to be a parody on the entrance of Cassan­ dra in the Troades;
but that in reality the Troades was not exhibited until seven years after the Wasps;
that is, iu B.C. 415.
And this is no doubt true:
see Clinton's Fasti Hellenici on that year, and Ælian’s Var.
Hist. ii. 8, there cited.
Both poets seem to have adopted.
independently, the familiar cries of the Gerameicus.
ἄνεχε, Trapeze may be ad­ dressed to the ruuner, in the sense of " hold it up, hand it on," erige, porrige :
or to the torch, in the sense of “shiue forth, lend light:
” or to the crowd, in which case πάρεχε may mean “make way," as supra 949.
Bergler refers also to Birds, 1720;
Eur. Cyclops, 203.1332.
ΣΥΜΠΟΤΗΣ.]
These three lines are commonly given to Bdelycleon, which is absurd, for Bdelycleon manifestly makes his first appearance at line 1360 infra;
and litigation is the last thing with which he would have threatened his father.
See infra 1392, 1418, and passim.
Beer therefore transfers the speech to the Chorus, which is worse;
for the Chorus are animated with the most friendly feelings towards Philo­ cleon, who had indeed done them no wrong.
Dobree truly says that the lines must belong to one τῶν ἐπακολουθούντων.
But no one seems even to have observed that the two great Aristophanic manu­ scripts (the Ravenna and the Venetian) place a συμπότης amongst the dramatis personæ.
And it is, in my judgment, self-evident that these lines belong to one of the injured συμπόται, speaking for the whole party, ἡμȋν ἕπασι.
Some of you that follow me Shall ere long be crying.
If they don't shog off, I swear I'll frizzle 'em all with the torch I bear, I'll set the rogues a-frying.

My little golden chafer, come up here,1340.
ἡλιαστής.]
To the man who had threatened him with a lawsuit, he applies a term, which a short while ago he regarded as a title of honour and dig­ nity, but which, in his altered mood, is expressive of nothing but contempt and disgust.
The crowd now retire, and Philocleon (with the αὐλητρìς) is left in possession of the field.
1341.
The next five and thirty lines con­ tain much that had been better omitted :
and the English on the right-hand page is in many places necessarily a substitu­ tion for, rather than a translation of, the original text.
These drunken scenes, and indeed the entire two hundred lines from 1250 to 1449, were, in my opinion, a mere afterthought on the part of the poet, introduced when the defeat of the Clouds had taught him that he could not with impunity discard the broad farce, the coarse buffoonery, of other comedians.
The dancing scene at the close of the Play was manifestly intended (when it was written) to exhibit the first outburst of Philocleon after drinking " the long untasted wine."
We have now two outbursts under precisely similar circumstances, and quite incon­ sistent with each other.
I imagine that according to the original scheme of the Play, Philocleon re-entered the house soon after he had learned to dress and behave with propriety;
that the Chorus in the little song ζηλῶ γε τη̑ς εὐτυχίας at once give vent to their hopes for the success of the experiment;
that then for the first time Xanthias comes out todescribe the effect which the wine was producing on his old master;
and that Philocleon forthwith follows with those imitations of Phrynichus for which we have been in some measure prepared by the observations of his fellow-dicasts, supra 269.
It must, however, be ad­ mitted that this enlargement has given us some capital scenes between Philocleon and his victims, and some very interest­ ing and racy specimens of the Sybaritic apologue.1342.
σχοινίου.]
This is undoubtedly the σκύτινον καθειμένον described in Clouds 538, 539, and explained by the Scholiast on that passage.
Aristophanes is there priding himself on having abandoned the φόρτος to which he here unhappily returns.
See the preceding note.1349.
ἐπì τῶν καταγελώντων (cf. supra 1007).
ἅμσ δὲ καì κακεμφύτως (with an allusion, which is continued in the next verse, to the word λεσβιεȋν above).
—Scholiast.
It is of crimes like these that Saint Paul speaks in the Epistle to the Romans, i. 26.
νοβοσκείου.—Scholiast.
Throughout the passage, Philocleon reverses the relation­ ship between himself and his son, andHold by this rope, a rotten one perchance, But strong enough for you.
Mount up, my dear.
See now, how cleverly I filched you off, A wanton hussy, flirting with the guests.
You owe me, child, some gratitude for that.
But you're not one to pay your debts, I know.
0 no !
you'll laugh and chaff and slip away, That's what you always do.
But listen now, Be a good girl, and don't be disobliging, And when my son is dead, I'll ransom you, And make you an honest woman.

I am so young, aud kept so very strict.

He's so afraid that I should turn out badly, For I'm in truth his only father now.
speaks as if he were the gay young spark, and his son the crusty cross-grained (δύσκολος) old Heliast.1353.
παλλακήν.]
A recognized concu­ bide.
For the distinction between the ἑταίρα, the παλλακὴ, and the γυνὴ, refer­ ence is usually made to Demosth.
adv. Neæram, 1386, τὰς μὲν γὰρ ἑταίρας ἡδονη̑ς φύλακα πιστὴν ἄχειν.
That the position of the παλλακὴ was recognized and pro­ tected by the law is plain from Lysias do Caede Erat. p. 94.1356. δύσκολον.]
Properly “troubled with indigestion," then “testy, irritable, splenetic.”
This was a special charac­ teristic of the Aristophanic dicast:
see supra 106, 883,942,1105, and Peace, 349.1357.
κυμινοπριστ
οκαρδαμóγλυφον.]
The separate limbs of this Aristophanic compound, κυμινοπρίστης and καρδαμο­ γλύφος, were in common use.
Bergler refers to Alexis apud Athenaeum, viii. 68, and Hesychius sub voc.:
and Porson to Theoer. x. 55. According to Aristotle, Ethics iv. 1. 39, the κυμινοπρίστης is the scraping paring niggard who professes to act, not from motives of illiberality, but on high moral principles.
1363.
πρό τῶν μυστηρίων.]
Before I was initiated into the mysteries of high life:
with an allusion to the raillery which accompanied the celebration of the great religious mysteries, and which was properly called τωθασμός.
Aristotle, Poll­ tics vii. 15.1364.
τυφεδανέ.]
Hesychius explains this word by τετυφωμένος, a dull-witted person:
Photius by τετυφωμένος and by ἀσθενὴς olov καπνός Suidas, though he gives both τυφεδανὲ and στυφεδανὲ, and cites this passage under each head, offers no explanation whatever.
1365.
σορου̑.]
Used παρὰ προσδοκίαν, as the Scholiast observes, for κóρης.
ὡραίας σ
ορ
ου̑ is maturi funeris, as we say a mature old age and the like:
ὡραία κóρη is ὡραία γάμου, matura viro.
Com­ pare Horace, Odes iui. 15, Maturo propior desine funeri Inter ludere virgines.
Pierson (Mœris, p. 126) is clearly wrong in his interpretation of this passage.
But here lie runs.
Belike he's after us.
Quick, little lady, hold these links an instant;
And won't I quizz him boyishly and well, As he did me before the initiation.
BDEL.

ἐξ ὄξους δίκην.]
This, as Bergler remarks, would have been one of his own favourite dishes a short time ago:
see supra 511.
But all his former tastes and habits he is now imputing to his son.1373.
ἀστιγμένην.]
The Scholiast says that torches were punctured and tattooed with figures of animals and the like :
and possibly Dardanis may have been branded on the forehead, ἐστιγμένη (see on 1296 supra), as an in-doing Phrygian slave.
In the next line we cannot escape from the explanation of the Scholiast, περὶ του̑ γυναικείον αἰδοίου ἐρωτᾳ̑.1381.
κοὐδὲν δύνασθαι δρα̑ν.]
Fired by this insult, Philocleon straightway calls to mind the anecdote taught him by Bdelycleon himself, supra 1192, as to what an old man can do;
and he at once retorts upon his preceptor his own teaching.1388.
ἴθι μοι.]
The persons whom Philocleon had attacked and maltreated on his way from the wine-party, supra 1323, have merely tarried until they could procure the necessary κλητη̑ρες, and now come thronging in with their writs and summonses.
The first that enters is a baking-girl, accompanied by, and calling for assistance to, a pallid and corpse-like κλητήρ.
The baking-girls of Athens had attained the same unenviable notoriety for their vituperative powers as, in England, is enjoyed by the fish­ women of Billingsgate.
In the Frogs (857) Dionysus says to Euripides and Æschylus, It is not right that mighty poets should Abuse each other, like two baking-girls.
The sompnour is none other than Chæ­ rephon, the well-known pupil of Socrates, on whose cadaverous complexion (ἡμιθνὴς, Clouds, 504) the wits of Athens were accustomed to expend all their shafts of ridicule.
And impotent old man.
PHIL.
Now look ye here :
Once, when surveying at the Olympian games, I saw how splendidly Ephudion fought With young Ascondas :

So mind your eye, or you'll be pummelled too.
BDEL.
Troth, you have learned Olympia to some purpose.
BAKING GIRL.
Oh, there he is !
Oh, pray stand by me now !
There's the old rascal who misused me so, Banged with his torch, and toppled down from here Bread worth ten obols, and four loaves to boot.
BDEL.
There now, you see;
troubles and suits once more
Your wine will bring us.
PHIL.
Troubles ?
Not at all.
A merry tale or two sets these things right.
I'll soon set matters right with this young woman.1391.
ἐπιθήκην.]
If the reading of this line, and the common interpretation of ἐπιθήκη, are correct, the words must refer to some custom of the trade with which we are now unacquainted.
ἄρτους δέκ' ὀβολω̑νcan mean nothing else than " ten obols' worth of bread;
" like the two hundred penny worth of bread, διακοσίων δηναρίων ἄρτοι, of the Gospels (St. Mark, vi. 37;
St. John, vi. 7).
It cannot mean, as commonly translated, " decem panes singulos unius assis."
Ten obols' worth of loaves seems to have constituted a complete packet, to be delivered at some single destination;
but in addition to these, the baking-girl was carrying four extra loaves, ἔξωθεν TOV φορτίουὄντας, as the Scholiast says.
The word ἐπιθήκη is taken to mean something thrown in, over and above the ordinary burden.
And such, I may observe, is exactly the sense in which it is employed by Plautus (Trinummus iv. 3. 18, probably from Phi­ lemon;
Id. Prologue 19), "Nisi etiam laborem ad damnum apponam epithecam insuper," " lose my goods and my labour to boot."
However, I do not feel sure that ἐπιθήκη may not (by analogy to θήκη, ἀποθήκη, and the like) mean the tray whereon the loaves were carried;
in which case we might either read ἄρτους δέκ'ὀβολω̑ν κατ' ἐπιθήκην τεττάρων, " ten loaves worth four obols which I had upon my tray," or retaining κἀπιθήκην (with τεττάρων) translate " loaves worth ten obols and a tray worth four."1394., διαλλάξουσιν.] " Ita enim," ob­ serves Bergler, " doccbat eum filius supra 1258."
He is going to put in practice the lessons which his son has taught him.1396.
καταπροίξειΜυρτίας.]
Shall not treat Myrtia thus with impunity ;
shall not get off unscathed from Myrtia.
So in a similar scene, Clouds, 1239, οὔτοι μὰ τὸν Δίαἐμου̑καταπροίξει.
In the next line Myrtia endeavours to overwhelm her opponent with the names of her father and mother.
Compare Knights, 1309.
Μὰ τὼ θεὼ, by Demeter and Persephone, is the regular female oath, and as such is perpetually employed by Aristophanes.
In the Ecclesiazusæ, when the women are practising to speak like men, one orator betrays her sex by asking for strong drink:

The same name is ap­ plied in the same " pretty indirect way " to a railing woman in the Menæchmi of Plautus (V. i. 14).

BAKING GIRL.

PHIL.
At Æsop, as he walked one eye from supper, There yapped an impudent and drunken bitch.
Then Æsop answered, 0 VOlt bitch !

If in the stead of that ungodly tongue You'd buy some wheat, methinks you'd have more sense.
BAKING GIRL.
Insult me too ?
I summon you before The Market Court for damage done my goods,She heaped abuse on every one slie saw, And therefore rightly was she called a bitch.
In the present passage the application of the tale, which had doubtless been enforced throughout by Philocleon's tone and gesture, is finally clinched by the expression πυροὺς πρίαιο, an expres­ sion which is appropriate not to the dog, but to a baking-girl who has lost her loaves.
πυροὺς, says the Scholiast, ὥστε ἄρτους ποιη̑σαι, ἐπεὶ ἀρτόπωλις.1407.
ἀγορανόμους.]
Just as to Eng­ lish markets there is incident a court which possesses a summary jurisdiction to keep order, and punish petty offences committed in the market:
so the άγοραὶ of Athens and Piratis were under the jurisdiction of ἀγορανόμοι who exercised a similar authority.
I u the Acharnians, Dicæopolis having appointed sundry stout leather thongs to be his ἀγορα­ ρόμοι, and to keep order in his market (723), has speedily occasion to invoke their aid to expel the informer from its precinets (824), and threatens to employ them even upon Lamachus (968).
Alei­ phron (Ep. i. 9) says that a powerfulpatron was necessary to protect the fisher­ men from the ἀγορανόμοι who, for the sake of obtaining bribes, were perpetually molesting quiet tradesmen.1408.
κλητη̑ρα.]
Upon this officer de­ volved the duty of seeing that the defend­ ant was duly served with the citation to appear in court and answer the plaintiff's claim.
The summons was served either by the κλητὴρhimself or in his presence.
κλητη̑ρες οἱ ἄνδρες, δι' ών εἰς τὰςδίκας προσ­ καλου̑νται οἱ δικαζόμενοί τισι.—Harpocra­ tion, Suidas, Etymol. Magn., Lex. Rhet. (MS. apud Ruhnken's Timæus).
That they were sometimes merely witnesses of the service of the citation is stated in the same passages, in Suidas s. v. κλη­ τεύει(εἰς δικαστήριον καλει̑ ἅμα μάρτυσι της παραγγελίας ούς κλήτορας ὠνόμαζον), and elsewhere.
In England this duty was at one time performed by certain special officers called Summoners or Sompnours.
A Sompnour is one of the Pilgrims in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and is un­ mercifully reviled by the Friar for his odious and unpopular office.
The Friar volunteers to tell a tale about a Somp­ nour.
But if it like unto this compagnie, I wol you of a Sompnour tell a game :
Parde, ye may wel knowen by the name, That of a Sompnour may no good be said (6860.3).
Accordingly he tells a tale of a Somp­ nour who plundered the innocent by pre­ tending to have citations against them, and then exacting bribes to arrange the matter.
Withouten mandement, a lewed man He coude sompne up peine (sub pœnâ) of Cristes curse, And they were inly glad to fill his purse;
.... He was (if I sbal yeven him his laud) A theef, and eke a sompnour, and a baud (6928-30, 6935-6).
Riding out one day under a forest side, he meets the devil, who questions him as to his office.
A, art tbou than a bailiff?
Ye, quod be.
He dorste not for veray filth and shame
Say that he was a sompnour for the name (6974-6).
After some joint adventures the devil carries him off.
And for my sompnour have this Chærephon.

Training, com­ peting with, rival choruses.
Lasus of Hermione was a contemporary and rival of the great Simonides of Ceos, who was famous for the number of victories ob­ tained by his dithyrambic choruses :
ἔξ ἐπὶπεντήκοντα, Σιμωνίδη, ἤ̜ραο νίκας.
See Bentley's Phalaris, Dissert. xi.
Of these two eminent dithyrambists an admirable account is given in Müller's Literature of Greece, chapter xiv.1411.
ὀλίγονμ
οι
Τhe speech of Lasus is emphasized in such a manner as to make it the reply of Philocleon himself to his female adversary, and to show his insolent contempt for her threats.
It is adopted by Bdelycleon, infra 1446.
And cf. Clouds, 1142 ;
Frogs, 1136.
No doubt the affected indifference of Lasus to the prize was owing to the consciousness that he had but slight chance of obtaining it, with the ever­ victorious Simonides for his antagonist.1413. θαψίνη.] " Are you a woman's sompnour, you with a face as pallid as dye-weed Ino ?"

reading (κλητεύειν), and the ordinary punctuation of the passage.
The comparison of Chærephon with θαψίνη Ino is of a piece with the epithet πύξινον which Eupolis in the Πόλεις bestowed on the same cadaverous student.
Schol. on Plato's Apology.
And see Schol. on 1408 supra.
The Thapsus or Thapsia (for though some­ what different qualities arc ascribed to them, they are said to be really the same plant), which is largely described by Dioscorides, Theophrastus, and Pliny, is unknown in England, and is by modern botanists called Thapsia Garganica.
It appears from the old grammarians that it was a plant used by dyers :
and that it imparted a yellow cadaverous hue which was associated by the ancients with the pallor of sickness and death;
an association heightened by the fortui­ tous similarity of the name to derivatives of θάπτω.
Thus Plutarch (Phocion, cap. 28) speaks of θάψινον χρω̑μα Kal νεκρω̑δες.
And Thcocritus (ii. 85—88, cited by the Scholiast) says,By the Scholiast on Theocritus, Hesy­ chius, Photius, and other grammarians, θάψινον is explained by ξανθὸν, and the plant is described as in use for dyeing wool and hair.
In Roman poetry the lutum, our dyer's weed (Reseda luteola) holds much the same position as the Thapsus held among the Greeks.
Thus Horace (Epode x. 16) describes the colour of checks blanched by fear as pallor LUTEUS, and Tibullus (i. 8. 52) says of the sickness of love, non illi sontica causa est, Sed nimius LUTO corpora tangit amor.1414.
'Ινοι̑.]
The story of Ino, daugh­ ter of Cadmus and wife of Athamas, who to escape her domestic miseries threw herself, with her youngest child Melicertes, into the sea, formed one of the most moving tragedies of Euripides.
See Acharnians, 434.
And the line before us no doubt refers to some scene in that Play where Ino in her desolation and misery throws herself at the feet sive imaginis Deæ cujusdam, as Conz says, sive hominis alicujus.
The name of Euripides seems to be substituted (παρὰ προσδοκίαν) out of sheer mischief for the purpose of connecting the solemn philosopher-poet with a ridiculous tra­ vestie.
1417.
Κατήγορος.]
The Scholiast says, παραγίνεταίτις ἀνὴρ Εὐριπίδης ὠνομασμένος, κατηγορω̑ν του̑Φιλοκλέωνος ί5{3pE"'S'.
In all the early editions the name of Euri­ pides is given here;
and in one of the Parisian MSS.
the words ἀνήρτις are prefixed to this, and Εὐριπίδηςto the fol­ lowing line.
The language, however, of the speaker is by no means that of the Aristophanic Euripides:

The name of Εὐριπίδης seems to have crept into the scholium, and thence into the MSS.
and editions, from some pre­ vious gloss on 1414.1418.
ὕβρεως;
μὴ, μή.]
For the ὕβρεως γραφὴ was a very different matter from the βλάβης δίκη with which alone the baking-girl had threatened him.
It was, so to say, a criminal indictment, and not a mere civil action :
and entailed a severe and speedy punishment, pro­ portioned to the gravity of the offence.
The provisions of the general law on ὕβρις are given by Demosthenes (contra Mid. 47), and should be borne in mind throughout the ensuing scene:
ἐάν τις (within thirty days, see the note on 260 supra) ἀφ' ἧς ἂνἡγραφὴ,—ὅτου 8' ἂν μέχριςἂν ἐκτίση̜.
In certain aggravated cases, different in kind from Philocleon's but still coming under the νόμος ὕβρεως (Æschines contra Tim. 17), the penalty was death ;
and death on the very day of conviction.1422.
πατάξαι καὶ βαλει̑ν.]
And thus Philocleon's prediction (supra 1254) is completely verified by the event.

The three Latin ver­ sions of this well-known proverb,— Cicero's iambic, Quam quisque nôrit artem in hâc se exercent (Tusc. Disp. i. 18),— Horace's hexameter, Quam scit uterque, libens censebo exercent artem (Epist. i. 14. 44),—and the pentameter of Proper­ tius, Quâ pote quisque in eâ conterat arte diem (ii. 1. 46, which, however, is hardly to be considered a version of the proverb), have already been quoted by various commentators.
And Dindorf efers to Athenæus, viii. 44.1432.
Πιττάλου.]
To the battered Sy­ barite the proverb conveyed a reproof for his rashness in practising an art in which he was unskilled.
To the battered Athenian it conveys a hint for his future conduct.
“Do not indulge in litigation, which is not your business and of which you know nothing:
but go to Pittalus (the great Athenian doctor of the day, Ach. 1032, 1222), and get your hurts treated.'
Such is, I suppose, the ap­ plication of the anecdote:
if indeed it has any application at all, and is not rather one of those tales described supra 1321, as οὐδὲν εἰκτας τῷ πράγματι.
Or it may mean that as the Sybarite got no relief, but merely a piece of sageThrown from his carriage, and he cracked his skull, Quite badly too.

This appeal is plainly addressed to Bdelycleon, whose observation in the preceding line had shown that he was alive to his father's misdoings.1437.

This is the strictly accurate phraseology;

There is consequently no ground whatever for Reiske's strange suggestion to substitute ἔχιν (viperam) for ἔχων.1440.

The art of riveting broken earthenware was well known to the ancients.

Αἴσωπον.]
It is said that the Delphians, enraged at the sarcasms of Æsop, concealed a sacred cup amongst his baggage as he was leaving Delphi.
They then pursued and overtook him;
and the cup being found in his posses­ sion, he was condemned to death on the charge of theft and sacrilege.
It was as he was being led out to execution, that he told them the fable of the Eagle and the Beetle;
seeking to warn his enemies that though he might be mean as the beetle, and they exalted as the eagle, yet his blood might ascend to heaven and cry for vengeance upon his murderers.
And it is for the like purpose, viz.
as a protest by the weak against the strong, that Philocleon would fain employ it here, as he is borne out, powerless, in the arms of his son.
The fable is preserved by the Scholiast on Peace, 129.
The eagle had carried off the young beetles:
thereupon the old beetle got into the eagle's eyry and pushed out her eggs.
The eagle flew to complain to Zeus, who bade her build her nest in his owu bosom.
But when the eagle had laid her eggs there, the beetle flew buzzing about the ears of Zeus ;
and he spring­ ing up to brush it away, dropped and broke the eggs.
The moral, says the Scholiast, is that there is no rest for the wicked, no, not even in the bosom of Zeus.
See the note on Peace, 129, from which the foregoing is an extract.
A third reference to the fable occurs in Lysistrata, 695.1449.

This is merely an expression of the speaker's impatience and disgust:
like Lucian's imprecation in his Pseudologistes, 24, κακὸν κακῶς σε ό λόγιος Ἑρμη̑ς ἐπιτρίψειεν αὐτοῖςλόγοις, or that of Trygæus in the Peace (1289), κάκιστ’ ἀπόλοιο, παιδάριον, αὐταῖς μάχαις.

Now all to soft indulgence
His eager soul will take, And yet perchance it will not, For, ah ! ’tis hard to break From all your life-long habits;
Yet some the change have made,1450.
Here, as I think, we return, after an interruption of about 200 lines, to the original scheme of the Play.
Every sentence of this little chorus be­ longs to a period, when the issue of Bdelycleon's experiment was yet uncer­ tain, and before the dry and law-loving Heliast had developed into the turbulent and reckless contemner of law.
How, for instance, is the expression, τάχα δ’ ἂν Venus οὐκ ἐθέλοι, compatible with the fact that Philocleon had already shown him­ self ready, and eager, to go all lengths in his new career of pleasure and dissi­ pation ?
How could such a phrase as σεμνοτέροις πράγμασι be applied without absurdity to the scenes which had recently been witnessed ?
How could the Chorus say that Bdelycleon had got the better in every argument, when Philoclcon had just set him and his ar­ guments at defiance, and he had found it impossible to control his father other­ wise than by an exercise of physical force ?1454.

The τι is intercalated to complete the metre.
The choral ode is divided into a strophe, and antistrophe, of twelve lines each :
and the metre is for the most part a mixture of iambic and choriambic:
the choriamb having occasionally one of its long syllables resolved into two short ones;
so as to make either (ἔτερα δὲ νυ̑ν, 1453;
φιλοπατρίαν, 1465), or (ἤθ|η μετά TI |σεῖται, 1454. παῖς ὁ Φιλοκλέ|ωνος,1466).

The last line of each system consists of an Ionic a minore and an iambic dipody.

The old dicasts who like Philocleon were formerly mad after law (οἷς ἐπεμαίνετο supra 744) are now mad after Bdelycleon and the new mode of life which he has unveiled to their gaze.
ἐξεχύθην means “ravished, trans­ ported, with love ..... melted with love or pleasure."
Other compounds of χέω are frequently so used:

Xanthias again enters to announce the strange proceedings of Philocleon at the feast.
No one would gather from the present passage that this was his second entrance on the selfsame errand:
nor is there anything in the drunken outburst which immediately follows, to intimate that there had been a previous exhibition of a similar character.
See the notes on 1292 and 1341 supra.
And indeed the purpose for which Philocleon has just been carried within was that he might be kept in peace and soberness:
and not that he might be beguiled by an-With other minds consorting, By other counsels swayed.

διὰ πολλοῦ χρóνον.]
After a long interval;
after long abstinence.
These words, though in absolute har­ mony with what I take to have been the original scheme of the Play, are so strikingly inconsistent with the scene which now immediately precedes them, that they have been with one consent mistranslated ut diu multumque potavit.
But there is really no doubt as to the true meaning of such phrases as but χρóνον, διὰ μακροῦ χρóνον, διὰ πολλοῦ χρό­ vov, and the like.

Θέσπις.]
"The ancient Poets," says Athenæus (i. 39), "Thespis, Pra­ tinas, Carcinus, and Phrynichus, were called ὀρχηστικοὶ, dancers ;
because they not only used much dancing in the Choruses of their Plays, but they were common dancing-masters, teaching any­ body that had a mind to learn."
And to the same purpose Aristotle (Poet. iv.) says that " the first Poetry of the stage was ὀρχηστικωτέρα, more set upon dances than that of the following ages."
I am citing from Bentley (Phalaris, Disserta­ tion xi.), by whom first this whole pas­ sage was properly arranged, emended, and explained.
See the extract at the end of these notes.
The éxtravagances into which Philocleon is now carried by the wine are in entire conformity with his previous character:
the performances of Thespis and Phrynichus, the earliest composers of Tragedy, had naturally been the delight of his boyhood:
and even throughout the austere duties of his dicastic life, he had cherished a pleasant remembrauce of their orchestral melodies.
See supra 269.
On the other hand, the gross scenes through which we have passed are as much out of keeping with Philocleon's antecedents, as they are, I am persuaded, with theThe long untasted wine, he grew so merry
He won't stop dancing all the whole night through Those strange old dances such as Thespis taught;
And your new bards he'll prove old fools, he says, Dancing against them in the lists directly.

The term κρό­ νος, which involves the idea of being obsolete and out of date, is amusingly applied to the modern, as contrasted with the ancient, dancers.

ΦΙΑ.]
Xanthias has barely con­ cluded, when a voice is beard within, clamouring for more space and freedom :
the doors are thrown open, and in an­ other instant the old dicast bonuds upon the stage in the style and attitude of a tragedy-dancer, challenging the world to atrial of skill.
As he skips and spins about, he calls the attention of the audience to the prodigious exertions re­ quired for the old-fashioned dances, as compared with those of modern days.
His language.
adapting itself to the per­ formance, is borrowed from the tragic stage:
όρχούμενος όγέρωύ παρατραγικύε­ ται, says the Scholiast.
The present line is addressed to the θυρωρὸς, who always sat at the αὕλειος θύρα of a wealthy house.1485.
σχήματος—λυγίσαντος.]
Bent­ ley was the first to arrange this passage rightly.
See the extract below.
"The old fellow," he observes, "begins to dance, and as he dances, he says, Make room there, for I'm beginning a dance that's enough to strain a man's side with the violent motion."
Theodoret (Hist. Ecel. ii. 27) uses the expression τινὰ τω̑ν έπὶ τη̑ς θυμέλης λυγιζομένων to describe a theatrical dancer.1489.
πι̑θ έλλέβορον.]
This is equi­ valent to saying, "The man's mad hellebore being the specific for cases of madness.
So Plautus, Pseudolus iv. 7.89, " helleborum hisce hominibus est opus."
And compare Horace, Satires ii. 3. 82.1490. πτήσσει. Φρύνιχος.]
I retain the manuscript reading πτήσσει in prefer­ ence to Bentley's celebrated emendation πλήσσει, because any one who has seen a cock about to strike, must have ob­ served the manner in which it crouches and sidles down immediately before it delivers its blow.
I imagine the old man to stoop, usiug the.
well-known proverb πτήσσει Φρύνιχος, but giving it a new turn by adding ὤς τις άλέϰτωρ έκλακίζων.
The servant, who sees what this stooping posture indicates, cries out Τάχαβλλήσεις, and sure enough the fling immediately follows.
See however the extract at the end of these notes.
That the Phrynichus here mentioned is in truth, as Bentley says, the ancient tragedian, the scholar of Thespis, is in my judgment conclusively established by the fact that these Phrynichean dances are τάϱχαἴ έκει̑ν'οἶςθέσπις ήγωνίζετο.
And cf. supra 220.
It is surprising that Sluiter (Lect. Andoc. vi. 120) and Meineke (Hist. Crit. 149, and Vind. Aristoph.) should fall into the long-exploded error of supposing that Aristophanes is here referring to some unknown contemporary actor, whose existence is inferred from certain ob­ scure passages in Andoc. de Myst. 47, and the Scholiast on Clouds, 1091, and Birds, 750.
And the reason which they give is as surprising as the error itself.
" Phrynichum," says Meineke, " non esse nobilem tragicum ab Aristophane sum­ mis laudibus ornatum temporum ra­ tiones evincunt:
is quo anno Vespæ commissæ sunt, dudum ad plures abi­ erat."
Surely nothing can be clearerAnd the tendons crack.

BDEL.
'Tis the midmost sonthan that Aristophanes is speaking of a Phrynichus qui dudum ad plures abi­ erat, one τω̑ν άρχαίων, not τω̑ν νυ̑ν.
The entire scene turns on the fact that Philocleon is giving a specimen, not of modern dancing, but of the old-fashioned performances of the early stage as con­ trasted with modern dancing.
1495.
στρέφεται κοτυληδών.]
In strict­ ness perhaps the word στρέφεται should be applied, not to the socket, but to the thigh-bone which turns within it:
as in Aristotle's definition of κοτυληδὼν (cited by Richter), TO έν ψ στρέφεται ό μηρός (Hist. Animal. I. x. 3).
The next two words, OVK εὕ,are by Dobree annexed to Philocleon's speech, ούκεὕ;

See the note on Peace, 551. άνείπω and κλω̑ are ill the sub­ junctive mood.
The challenge itself is conveyed in the two following lines.
1501.
Καρκίνου.]
Philocleon holds the lists against all comers, as the champion of the older tragic dances, the dances of Phrynichus and Thespis.
Three repre­ sentatives of the modern school of tragic dancing now enter, one by one, to accept his challenge, and contend against him in a trial of skill.
They are the three deformed and stunted sons of Carcinus, the constant butts of Aristophanes for their preposterous dances, and their grotesque and ungainly gestures.
The remainder of the Play is occupied by the contest, and enlivened by a running fire of jokes upon the name of Carcinus (Crabbe).
So far as we can judge from the doubtful and conflicting statements contained in the Aristophanic Scholia, it would seem that Carcinus had four sons, though Aristophanes only speaks of three.
These three were dancers inthe choruses of their father's tragedies, one of them, Xenocles (Thesm.
169,440;
Frogs, 86), being also himself a tragic poet.
Another son was named Xeno­ timus, but the names of the third and fourth sons (if there was a fourth) are uncertain.
Iu the Scholia on Clouds, 1261, the sons of Careinus are called Xenocles, Xenotimus, and Demotimus:
on Peace, 778, Xenocles, Xenotimus, and Xenarchus:
on Frogs, 86, Xenocles, Xenotimus.
and Xenoclitus :
whilst an­ other Scholiast there adds a fourth name, Datis.
The name of Datis is also given to a tragic poet, son of Careinus, by the Scholiast on Peace, 289.
Here too the Scholiast recognizes four sons, saying, τέσσαρες μεν δή είσιν, άλλ' οί τρει̑ς οὖν μέσος. Meineke in his Hist.
Crit., Epimetra i.
De poetis comicorum numero eximendis, discusses these statements, but arrives at no satisfactory conclusion.
The diminutive and ungraceful figures of the trio are ridiculed in Peace, 789, where Aristophanes calls them The epithet γυλιύχενας may perhaps excuse my translation of όρχίλων, infra 1513, by " wrynecks."
See also Peace, 864, and the note there.
Xenocles was described by Plato Comicus (Scliol. on Peace, 790) as1502.

Athenceus, i. 37, citing several old Treatises on Dancing, says that the Tragic dance was called έμμέλεια, the Comic κόρδαξ, and the Satyric σίκιννις.
So Lucian de Saltatione, cap. 26, and the Scholiast on Clouds, 540.
Again in xiv. 30 Athenæus says, ό μὲν κόρδαξ παρ"Ελλησι φορτικὸς, ή δ' έμμέλεια σπουδαία. Plato too (Laws, vii. pp. 814, 6) pronounces the Pyrrhic dance and the εμμέλεια to be σπουδαι̑α, as opposed to όρχήματα φαυ̑λα;
the dance of War and the dance of Tragedy being considered to express the har­ monious and rhythmical feelings of a well-ordered mind.
It was with this stately measure that Hippoclides corn­ menced his performances in the great assemblage of suitors at Sicyon, Hdt. vi. 129:
but it certainly was not with this dance (as Schweighæuser and the other Commentators there suppose) that he scandalized Cleisthenes, and " danced away his marriage."
The corrupt pas­ sage of Hesychius (sub voc.) gives no countenance to their view:
and Hero­ dotus draws a clear distinction between the έμμέλεια with which Hippoclides began, and the extravagant σχήματα which after an interval of rest he pro­ ceeded to execute.

όξίς.] εἶδος άγγείου όξηρου̑.— Scholiast.
όξὶς is everywhere used for a vinegar cruet ;
see Frogs, 1440, 1453 ;
Plutus, 812 ;
and there is no ground for the suggestion of Schneider and Conz that Aristophanes must here be applying the name to some insect.
Brunck refers to Birds, 1203, πλοι̑ον ή κυνη̑;
and rightly observes, " Sic res dissimillimas jungere solent, quum mira et insolitâ oblatâ specie, quo earn nomine appellare de­ beant, hæsitant."1510.
άπιυνοτήρης.]
This is the tiny crustacean (Pinnotheres veterum) about the size of a pea, and thence in modern times called the pea-crab, which en­ sconces itself within the shell of some living pinna, mussel, cockle, or oyster, but more especially the pinna.
Sec Bell's British Crustaceans, pp. 121- 129 ;
Wood's Natural History, iii. pp. 424. and 588.
The pinna is a wedge-shaped bivalve which moors itself to the rock by a clot of short silky threads, called its hyssus.
It was supposed by theancients to be a most helpless crea­ ture, unable even to cater for its own support, without the assistance of the little pea-crab.
Accordingly the two combined together, and worked in unison for their joint subsistence.
The pinna, having got its little guest safely lodged within, left its shell open:
and so soon as any food came between the valves, the pea-crab gave its host a sharp nip, which, caused it instantly to close its shells, and so to secure the prey.
It was commonly supposed that the pea-crab was necessary to the very existence of the pinna, and that if it were removed, the pinna would die.
Hence the little parasite was called Πιννοτήρη or Πιννο­ φύλαξ.
'H πίννη, says Chrysippus apud Ath. iii. 38, διαστήσασα τὸὄστρακον, κατεσθίουσι κοινη̑.
A similar account is given in Aristotle, Hist. Animal. v. 13;
Plutarch de Solert.Anim. cap.30;
Pliny, ix. 66;
Ælian, Hist. Anim. ii. 29;
Cicero de Nat. Deorum.ii. 48;
Do Fini­ bus, In. 19. Oppian puts the story into some pleasing verses.
Speaking of the pinna, he says,
There is no doubt of the constant pre­ sence ofthe pea-crab in the shells ofthese molluscs, but the theory invented by the ancients to account for the phenomenon has long been exploded.
Here the term pinnoteres is applied to Xenocles because he was όσμιρότατος TOV γένους, as Aris­ tophanes goes on to say:
for unqnes­ tionably the comma which has hitherto been placed after γένους should be re­ moved, and a comma should be placed instead after έστι, and after σμικρότατος.1512.
μακάριε τη̑ς εύπαιδίας.]
Richter absurdly attributes to εύπαιδίας in this place the double meaning (which εὕπαις is said occasionally to bear) of " being aThe tiniest crab :

PUlL. 0 Carcinus !
0 proud and happy father!

The phrase is used in precisely the same sense here, as in the account which Eusebius gives of the feelings wherewith the father of Origen regarded his illustrious child.
He checked the boy to his face, the historian says, but often when his son was asleep he was wont to gaze upon him with reverential awe, Kai ΤΗΣ ΕΥΤΕΚΝΙΑΣ MAKAPION έαυτὸν ἡγήσασθαι (Hist. Eccl. vi. 2).1513. ὀρχίλων.]
TiMens.
See the note on 1501 supra.
κατέπεσεν, pitched, like a flock of birds.
“ὀρχίλων pro ὀρχηστω̃ν,” says Bergler, " propter similitudinem vo­ cum.
Indicat eos parvæ esse staturæ:
mox eOB τριόρχας dicit."1511.
καταβατέον.]
Not, as Richter thinks, quia tam pusilli sunt, but because the Greeks said καταβαίνειν εἰς TOV ὰγω̃να, as the Latins said descendere in certa­ men.
At the end of the line, μοι˙ σὺ δὲ is Hermann's excellent emendation for μ’ ὠ̨ζυρὲ, which had no meaning on the lips of Philocleon, and was probably borrowed from 1504 supra.
The awk­ wardness was perceived by Bentley, who proposed to transfer the line to Bdely­ cleon;
but Hermann's suggestion re­ moves all difficulty, and softens the abruptness of the order given in the following line.
1518.
μεγαλώνυμα.]
Aristophanes means, I suppose, to contrast the high­ sounding names of the sons of Carcinus with their puny and insignificant per­ sons.
They were μεγαλώνυμα, though not μεγαλοσώματα.
The rest of the Play (omitting the two half-lines) is written in a compound metre (ἀσυνάρτητος, seethe note on 248 supra, and Bentley's Phalaris, Diss. xi.), which may be roughly described as a sort of iambic tetra­ meter catalectic, varied by the introduc­ tion of two anapæsts in place of the second, third, and fourth feet.
Thus if in line 1529 we substitute πρὸς οὐρανὸν for οὐράνιον, we have the ordinary tetra­ meter, ῥῖπτε σκέλος πρὸς οὐρανόν˙ βἑμβικες ἐγγενέσθων.
The two half-lines are in the same metre, stopping at the end of the second anapæst.
The metrical scheme is as follows:
It may perhaps be represented to the English ear by the following translation of lines 1531-2, For hither is creeping along | the Ocean Lord, their father, Well pleased with the feats of his sons | the three surprising dancers.
The same metre is found in Eccl. 580, μισοῦσι γὰρ ἢν τὰ παλαιὰ πολλάκις θεω̑νται.
Its nature is explained in Hephæstion's fifteenth chapter, and Gaisford's notes there.
The anapæstic section of the verse is sometimes considered to end with the second anapaest (according to the scheme above), and then the second half is iambic :
or sometimes it annexes the succeeding syllable, and then the second half is ithyphallic, i. e. composed of three trochees, It was on the latter principle that Archilochus, who invented these verses, generally divided them.
Hephæstion gives the following example from Archi­ lochus, ’Ερασμονίδη Χαρίλαε—χρη̑μά τοι γελοῖον.
But subsequent writers used both cæsuras indiscriminately.
The first section of the line was also some­ times regarded as composed of an Ionic a majore and a choriamb, Hephæstion gives several examples of the metre:
and many more are col­ lected, from Athenæus and elsewhere, in Gaisford's excellent notes.1522.
καρίδων.]
These ungainly little performers are styled καρίδων ἀδελφοὶ, partly perhaps as a joke on their gro­ tesque and dwarfish figures:
partly because, in their character of καρκίνοι, they would be fellow-crustaceans in­ habiting the same localities:
and partly because, in their character of dancers,Ye brethren of the shrimps, come and leap
On the sand and on the strand of the salt and barren deep.
Whisk nimble feet around you;
kick out, till all admire, The Phrynichean kick to the sky;
That the audience may applaud, as they view your leg on high.
On, on, in mazy circles;
hit your stomach with your heel;
Fling legs aloft to heaven, as like spinning-tops you wheel.
their amazing leaps and bounds might vie with the perpetual springing and frisking of the shrimps παρὰ θῖν’ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο.
“Walking by the sea-side in a calm evening," says Dr. Paley in a well-known passage of his Natural Theology, chap. xxvi., " upon a sandy shore and with an ebbing tide, I have frequently remarked the appearance of a dark cloud, or rather, very thick mist, hanging over the edge of the water to the height, perhaps, of half a yard, and of the breadth of two or three yards, stretching along the coast as far as the eye could reach, and always retiring with the water.
When this cloud came to be examined, it proved to be nothing else than so much space filled with young shrimps, in the act of bounding in the air, from the shallow margin of the water, or from the wet sand."
Bergler compares the iambic line and a half cited by Athenæus (iii. GO) in his chap­ ter on shrimps, ὠρχοῦντο δ’ ὡς καρῖδες, ἀνθράκων ἔπι Πηδῶσι κυρταί.
The penul­ timate of καρίδων is common:
see Athe­ næus ubi supra and the next chapter.
The phrase παρὰ θῖν’ ἁλὸς ἀτρ
υγέτοιο is, of course, of perpetual occurrence in Homer (Iliad, i. 316, 327, etc.).1524. τὸ Φρυνίχειον.]
Bentley appears to take this as if it were Kara τὀ Φρυνίχειον, in Phrynichus's way.
See the extract at the end of these notes.
And so Bergler and Brunck translate it, Phry­ nichi more, in morem Phrynichi.
But I should rather suppose ἐκλάκτισμα to be understood, TO Φρυνίχειον ἐκλάκτισμα ἐκ­ λακτισάτω.
κυκλοσοβεῖτε is Dindorf's happy emendation, metri causâ, for ἐν κύκλῳ σοβεῖτε.1520'.
ἰδόντες.]
This, which was Bout­ ley's conjecture for ᾄδοντες, is now fully confirmed by the MSS.
A syllable was wanting after σκέλος, and I have inserted ὦδε there.
The Chorus seem to be join­ ing
In the dance, and I imagine that they here give a specimen of the action which they are recommending.
See supra 279, 688, 1169;
Peace, 57;
Eccl. 260, and frequently elsewhere.
The dance itself is evidently a caricature of the τραγικαὶ ὀρχήσεις :
a grotesque and extravagant caricature, no doubt:
and Bergler says, “Cordacem saltant:
huc enim respicit Scholiastes in Nub. 542, quum ait τὸν δὲ κόρδακα ἐν τοῖς Σφηξὶν εἰσήγαγεν.”
There is certainly no other scene to which that Scholiast could be referring, but I do not know whether the term κ
ορδαξ would be strictly applicable to such a dance as this.
1534.
τρόρχαις.] ἔπαιξε διὰ τὸ τρεῖς [ὀρχηστὰς] εἶναι. ἔστι δὲ ὁ τριόρχης ὄρνεον. —Scholiast.
See note on 1513 supra.
The τριόρχης was a hawk (Birds, 1181) of the species represented by our well- known Hobby, which is still called Hypo­ triorchis subbuteo.1537.
ὀρχούμενος.]
The novelty sug­ gested is not that the Chorus should make their exit with a dance;
which indeed, notwithstanding the Scholiast, I do not believe would have been any novelty at all:
but that the Actors, un­ connected with the Chorus, should them­ selves dance at the head of the procession.
It is a satire on the extravagant strain­ ing after orchestral novelties which dis­ tinguished the sons of Carcinus, andYour Sire is creeping onward, the Ruler of the Sea, He gazes with delight at his hobby-dancers three.
Come, dancing as you are, if you like it, lead away, For never yet, I warrant, has an actor till to-day Led out a chorus, dancing, at the ending of the Play.
which caused Aristophanes and other comedians to describe them as μηχανοδί­ φας, δωδεκαμηχάνους, and the like.
See the passages cited in the note on 1501 supra.
Here then is something for them to do which no man has ever done before, οὐδείς τω πάρ
ος δέδρακεν.
As this whole scene is avowedly a burlesque parody on tragic dancing and tragic dancers, I am not sure that we ought not, with several MSS.
and all the early editions, to read τραγῳδῶν as the last word of the Play.
τρυγῳδῶν however is found in the best MSS., and is now uuiversally adopted.
And so, in the midst of wild revelry and excitement, ends the Comedy of the Wasps:
the irony of fate, as Muller observes (Greek Literature, chap. 28), having brought about a revolution, the counterpart of that delineated in the Clouds.
There, a father diverts his son from fashionable pleasures to pursuits adapted for litigation, and lives to rue the day when he succeeded in doing so.
Here, a son diverts his father from liti­ gation to fashionable pleasures, and is rewarded with a corresponding result.
I SUBJOIN an extract from Bentley's Dissertations on Phalaris.
In the Eleventh Dissertation, " Age of Tragedy," from which this extract is taken, he is engaged in showing that Tragedy properly so called, the Tragedy of Thespis and Phrynichus, was unknown in the days of the tyrant of Agrigentum.
In fixing the date of Phrynichus, he has occasion to contend that there were not, as some say, two tragic poets of that name, viz. (1) an elder Phrynichus, the son of Polyphradmon and scholar of Thespis;
and (2) a later Phrynichus, the son of Melanthas, the author of the Φοίνισσαι and the Μιλήτου ἅλωσις;
but that these two alleged Phrynichuses were really one and the same person.
And after many other arguments, lie proceeds to consider the manner in which Phrynichus is mentioned in the Wasps.
“Aristophanes in his Vespæ says that the old men at Athens used to sing the old songs of Phrynichusa, 'Tis a conceited word of the poet's own making, and σιδωνο which is one member in the composition of it, relates to the Phœnissæ (i. e. the Sidonians), a play of Phrynichus's, as the Scholiast well observes.
Here we see the author of Phœnissæ (whom they suppose to be the latter Phrynichus) is meant by Aristophanes:
but if I prove too that Aristophanes in this very place meant the Phrynichus Thespis's scholar, 'twill be evident that these two Phrynichuses (whom they falsely imagine) are really one and the same.
Now that Aristophanes meant the scholar of Thespis will appear from the very words μέλη ἀρχαῖα, ancient songs and tunes.
Ancicnt, because that Phrynichus was the second, or, as some in Plato thought, the first author of tragedy;
and songs and tunes because he was celebrated and famous by that very character.
Phrynichus, says the Scholiast on this place \ had a mighty name for making of songs:
but in another place he says the same thing of Phrynichus the son of Pulyphradmon, who, according to Suidas, was Thespis's scholar:
He was admired, says he, for the making of songsc;
they cry him up for the composing of tunes;
and he was before Æschylusd.
And can it be doubted then, any longer, but that the same person is meant ?
'Tis a problem of Aristotle's, Διὰ τί οἱ περὶ Φρὑνιχον μᾶλλον ἦσαν μελοποιοί;
Why did Phrynichus make more songs than any tragedian does now-a-dayse?
And he answers it,'H διὰ τὸ πολλαπλάσια εἶναι τύτε τὰ μέλη ἐν ταῖς τῶν μέτρων τραγῳδίαις;
correct it τὰ μέλη τῶν μέτρων ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις.
Was it, says he, because at that time the songs (sung by the Chorus) in tragedies were many more than the verses (spoken by the actors)?
Does not Aristotle's very question imply that there was but one Phrynichus a tragedian ?“
I will add one argument more for it, and that, if I do not much mistake, will put an end to the controversy.
For I will prove that the very passage in Aristophanes, where the Scholiast, and Suidas from him, tell us of this (supposed second) Phrynichus the son of Melanthas, concerns the one and true Phrynichus the scholar of Thespis.
The ancient poets, says Athenæusf, Thespis, Pratinas, Carrinus, and Phrynichus, were culled ὀρχηστικοὶ, dancers;
because they not only used much dancing in the choruses of their plays, but they were common dancing- masters, teaching anybody that had a mind to learn.
And to the same purpose Aristotle s tells us, that the first poetry of the stage was ὀρχηστικωτέρα, more set upon dances than that of the following ages.
This being premised (though I had occasion to speak of it before), I shall now set down the words of the poeth, which are spoken by a servant concerning an old fellow, his master, that was in a frolic of dancing.
Who the Thespis was that is here spoken of, the Scholiast and Suidas pretend to tell us:
for they say, ’twas one Thespis a harper, not the tragic poet1.
To speak freely, the place has not been understood this thousand years and more, being neither written nor pointed right.
For what can be the meaning of κρόνους τὸν νοῦν?
The word κρόνος alone signifies the whole, and TOV νοῦν is super­ fluous and needless.
So in another placeJ, I humbly conceive the whole passage should be thus read and distinguished, All night long, says he, he dances those old dances that Thespis used in his choruscs :
and he says he'll dance here upon the stage by and by, and show the tragedians of these times to be a parcel of fools, he'll out-dance them so much.
Andwho can doubt now, that considers what I have newly quoted from Athenæus, but that Tbespis ὀ ἀρχαȋος, the old tragic poet (who lived CXIV years before the date of this play), ὁ ὀρχηστικὸς, the common dancing-master at Athens, is meant here by Aristophanes ?
So that the Scholiast and Suidas may take their harper again for their own diver­ sion :
for it was a common practice among those grammarians, when they happened to be at a loss, to invent a story for the purpose.
But to go on with Aristophanes the old fellow begins to dance, and as he dances, he says, So the interlocution is to be placed here, which is faulty in all the editions.
Make room there, says he,for I'm beginning a dance that's enough to strain a man's side with the violent motion.
After a line or two, he adds,
Thus these words are to be pointed, which have hitherto been falsely distinguished.
But there's an error here of a worse sort which has possessed the copies of this play ever since Adrian's time, and perhaps before.
Πτήσσω signifies to crouch and sneak away for fear as poultry do at the sight of the kite, or a cock, when he is beaten at fighting.
The Scholiastk and Ælian1 tell us that πτήσσει Φρύνιχος, ὥσπερ ἀλέκτωρ, Phrynichus sneaks like a cock, became a proverb upon those that came off badly in any affair;
because Phrynichus the tragedian came off sneakingly when he was fined 1000 drachms for his play Μιλήτου ἅλωσις.
Now, with clue reverence to antiquity, I crave leave to suspect that this is a proverb coined on purpose, because the commentators were puzzled here.
For, in the first place, to sneak away like a cock, seems to be a very improper similitude :
for a cock is one of the most bold and martial of birds.
I know there's an expression like this, of some nameless poet’
sHe sneaked like a cock that hangs down his wings when he's beaten m.
But this case is widely different:
for the comparison here is very elegant and natural, because the circumstance of being beaten is added to it;
but to say it in general of a cock, as if the whole species were naturally timid, is unwarrantable and absurd.
As in another instance :
he stares like a man frightened out of his wits, is an expression proper enough:
but we cannot say in general, he stares like a man.
I shall hardly believe, therefore, that Aristophanes, the most ingenious man of an age that was fertile of great wits, would let such an expression pass him, he sneaks like a cock.
But, in the next place, the absurdity of it is doubled and tripled by the sentence that it's joined with:
Phrynichus, says he, kicking his legs up to the very heavens in his dances, crouches and sneaks like a cock.
This is no better than downright nonsense;
though, to say something in excuse for the interpreters, they did not join ἐκλακτίζων with Φρύνιχος, as I do, but with the word that follows in the next verse.
But, if the reader pleases to consult the passage in the poet, he will be convinced that the construction can be no other than what I have made it.
Ἐκλακ­ τισμὸς, says Hcsychius, σχῆμα χορικὸν, ὀρχήσεως σύντονον, (correct it σχῆμα χορικῆς ὀρχήσεως, σύντονονn,) was a sort of dance lofty and vehement, used by the choruses.
And Julius Pollux, Τὰ ἐκλακτίσματα, γυναικῶν ἦν ὀρχήματα ἔδει γὰρ ὑπὲρ TOP ὦμον ὲκλακτίσαι:
tile ἐκλατίσματα, says he, were tile dances of women ;
for they were to kick their heels higher than their shoulders °.
But I conceive here's a palpable fault in this passage of Pollux:
for certainly this kind of dance would be very unseemly and immodest in women.
And the particle γὰρ,for, does further show the reading to be faulty.
For how can the throwing up the heels as high as the head in dancing, be assigned as a reason why the dance must belong to women ?
It would rather prove it belonged to men, because it required great strength and agility.
But the error will be removed, if instead of γυναικῶν we correct it γυμνικῶν.
The dance, says he, was proper to the γυμνικοὶ, exercisers;
for the legs were to be thrown up very high, and consequently it required teaching and practice.
Well, it's evident now, how every way absurd and improper the present passage of Aristophanes is.
If I may have leave to offer at the emendation of so inveterate an error, I would read the place thus;
i. e. Phrynichus STRIKES like a cock, throwing up his heels very lofty.
This is spoken by the old fellow while he's cutting his capers;
and in one of his frisks he offers to strike the servant that stood by, with his foot as it was aloft.
Upon which the servant says, Tria βαλλήσεις,you’ll hit me by and by with your capering and kicking.
Πλήσσω is the proper term for a cock when he strikes as he's fighting;
as πλῆκτρ
ον is his spur that he strikes with.
The meaning of the passage is this, that in his dances he leaped up and vaulted like Phrynichus, who was celebrated for those performances :
as it further appears from what follows a little after, which ought to be thus corrected and distinguished, i. e. And, in Phrynichus’s way,friskand caper;
so as the spectators, seeing your legs aloft, may cry out with admiration.
Now, to draw our inference from these several passages, it appears, I suppose, sufficiently, that the Phrynichus here spoken of by Aristophanes was, as well as the Thespis, famous for his dancing, and consequently, by the authority of Athenæus quoted above, he must be ὁ ἀρχαȋος Φρύνιχος, the ancient Phrynichus, 6 ὀρχηστικὸς, the master of dancingq.
Upon the whole matter, then, there was but one tragedian Phrynichus, the scholar of Thespis."THE following synopsis is constructed on the same principles as that contained in my Appendix to the Peace.
For an exposition of those principles, and a brief narrative of the successive stages through which the Aristophanc text has passed, the reader is referred to that Appendix.

The readings of the RavEnna and Venetian manuscripts are given in accordance with the collation made by Bekker;

London, 1865Mr. Mitchell's edition of the Wasps (to the end of the Parabasis), London, 1835, merely follows the text of Dindorf.
Dr. Holders earlier edition was also based on Dindorf's text:
in his last edition he substantially follows Meineke, a far less safe guide.
Modern German criticism, as regards Aristophanes at least, is calculated rather to display the ingenuity of the critic, than to improve the text of the author.
Alterations are introduced, without any semblance of autho­ rity or probability, apparently for no other reason than that they would, in the opinion of the editor, have done as well as the received and authorized reading.
Fortunately each succeeding editor, whilst he introduces a host of novelties of his own, sweeps away all those introduced by his predecessor, so that we are never more than one remove distant from the genuine text.
Recent editors concur in numbering the lines as they are numbered in the text of Brunck’s edition.
Owing to this convenient practice, references to Aristophanes have acquired a fixity and a uniformity which are wanting in references to Pindar and the Attic Tragedians.2.

Cobet suggests προτενεȋ, and so Hirschig.
For λέγων V. has λέγω.22. τί ταυτόν. Cobet, Hirschig, and Richter:
and Meineke in his Vind.
Aristoph.
appears to approve of this reading (bnt would also change ταυτὸν into ταυτὸν ὄν).
Moreover it brings the passage into an exact accord with the actual riddle quoted.
See the note on the line.
Before Brunck the reading was ὅ,τι which is treated by the Scholiast as an Attic usage for τί.
ἐν τῷ ὅ,τι, he says, περιττεύει τὸ0 ᾽Αττικῶς τὸ γὰρ σημαινόμενον ἀντὶ τοῦ τί ταυτὸν ἐν γῇ ἐν ἐρωτήσει.
Bergk too in his notes pre­ fers ὅ,τι.
But no such Attic usage is known :
and Brunck introduced ὅτι, connecting it with πῶς δὴ, “ How comes it that?”
And on is found in most editions since Brunck (those editors who follow Bentley's distribution of the pre­ ceding line connecting ὅτι with λέγων), and apparently in the MSS.
τ᾽ ἀπέ­ βαλεν.
R. V. Bekker, recentiores.
In the old editions the line ran ὅ,τι ταυτὸν θηρίον ἔντε yn (ἐν yῇ. Π.), and γ᾽ἀπέβαλε (ἀπέβαλεν. Φ.) was substituted for θηρίον in the following line.
P. has ταυτὸν ἐν γῇ θηρίον, and so Brunck and Weise.24.

authority.
The older editions gave the words ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν λέγει to Sosias (and so, according to Dindorf, does V., though Bekker says otherwise);
and some gave the following line to Xanthias, getting back into the right arrangement at line 78.
Meineke (followed by Holden) gives 74 and half 75 to Sosias;
the rest of 75 and 76 and 77 to Xanthias;
78 and half 79 to Sosias;
the rest of 79 and 80 to Xanthias;
81 and 82 to Sosias;
and 83—136 to Xanthias.
But the ordinary arrange­ ment is far better.
Richter too divides the line before us, giving the words αλλ’ οὐδὲν λέγει to Sosias.
The Scholiast says, τινὲς ἀμοιβαῖα.

Antiphon, 137, on the first point, and to Plato, Gorgias, p. 502 D, on the second.
The Scholiast also mentions two persons, apparently Athenian citi­ zens, of the name of Sosias.
However, for the reasons given in my note, I dissent from the received opinion which makes Sosias here the name of one of the audience.

The reading in the text is confirmed by the Scholiast, οὐκ εἰσελεύσει!
μετὰ φθορᾶς ;
(get in and be hanged to you,) and is indubitably correct.
Unfortunately some commentators object to the ἐσ-, and hence various alterations for the worse have been proposed.

BA.
The older editions down to and including Bekker, and Weise, Bothe, and Bergk read OIK.
παῖ τὴν θύραν ὤθει, except that after Brunck OIK.
was changed into ΣΩ., and that Bothe and Bergk omit the pre­ fix altogether.
But R. and V. leave a lacuna in the place of παῖ, and so Din­ dorf, who however suggests σύ.
Bergk conjectures τίς τὴν θύραν ὠθεῖ ;
Meineke and Holden, after Hermann, omit the prefix and read ὅδε τὴν θύραν ὠθεῖ.
Richter reads σὺ δὲ τὴν θύραν ὤθει.
I think that Hermann must be right in reading ὠθεῖ, otherwise we have no indi­ cation that Philocleon has shifted his ground from the chimney to the door :
but if we are allowed to fill up the lacuna at our pleasure, νῡν seems to me more appropriate than ὅδε ;
or we might read τήνδ' αὖ ;
and I think that this half-line must certainly belong to Sosias:
whilst the directions from πίεζε to ἐκτρώξεται, which are usually continued to Sosias, should clearly be attributed to Bdely­ cleon, who is throughout the commander- in-chief conducting the operations, and who would not keep silence at this crisis.

The prefix ΦΙΑ.
before ó γὰρ θεὸς was omitted in all editions antecedent to Bergler, who seeing that these words must belong to Philocleon, gave him the whole three lines 158-60.
The present line was rightly divided by Bentley and Brunck, who also first added the note of interrogation (will that υεϰ you ?) after φέροις.
For φέροις the editions before Sca­ liger varied between φέρῃς (Aldus, Jun­ ta, Gormont, Grynæus) and φέρεις (Za­ netti, Farræus, Rapheleng).
Bdelycleon's part in the ensuing dialogue 158—169 is transferred to Xauthias by Beer, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden;
and divided be­ tween Xanthias and Sosias by Rich­ ter.160.
Tore. πότε. Junta, Zanctti, Far­ ræus, Hapheleng. ἄν τότε.

Ου̉τις is the proper accentua­ tion of the proper name:
but V. and most of the older editors have it Οὔτις.
῎Ιθακος too in 185 is in V. and some edi­ tions accentuated ᾽Ιθακός.191.

So Bentley, Bergk, Meineke, Holden.
In the MSS.
and old editions these four lines are given to a servant, but the last line at all events belongs to Bdelycleon.
Brunck in his version gives the whole to Bdelycleon;
but in his text he makes Bdelycleou's speech commence with νὴ Δἲ.
The latter arrangement is followed by Bekker, Dindorf, and Weise.
Richter makes Bdelycleon's speech com­ mence with ποῶ ποῦ.
I have followed Bentley in giving him the whole.

but Dobree shows that ἀπεκοιμήθμεν is the proper form for a military watch.
Rich­ ter actually proposes ἀποκοιμώμεσ y', saying in his usual manner, " aoristus non placet:

He resisted the idle impulse however, which is more than can be said for Brunch, who is followed by Meineke and Holden.
The expression τί δὴ μαθὼν is at least as probable in itself, and is supported by the entire force of the MSS.
here :
in Acharnians, 826:
and in Lysistrata, 599, τί μαθὼν OVK ἀποθνήσκεις;

and Richter (from conjectures of Reisig and Bergk) substitutes έπεφέμηνε δ' for εἶτ' ἐφλέγμηνεν.
Bothe makes various altera­ tions in these lines without authority or probability.
For TO σφυρὸν V. has τὸν σφυρόν.278. ἂν έπείθετ'. R. V. II. vulgo. ἀνε­ πείθετ' (junctim).
P. φ. Dobree.280.
ἒλεγεν. λέγων. R. After this line the words ὒπαγ' ὦ παῖ, ὒπαγε are interpolated (without any authority) by Hermann, Richter, Meineke, and Hol­ den, from verse 290:
a singularly per­ verse corruption of a genuine text.
The words ὒπαγ' ὦπαῖ ὒπαλε signify that the μέλος is over and the Chorus arc prepared to proceed.
They would be quite out of place here.
It is impossible that the Chorus should tell the boy to lead on, while they were yet in the very midst of their song.
282.

Hermann, Dindorf, Holden, Meineke. καὶλέλων ἑς. vulgo. λέγων. θ' ἑς. Weise. τε λέγων 0' ἑς. Richter. Bergk conjectured τ'ἒλεγεν ἑς.285.

ὁπωσουν αἰσχυνεῖς κἁγχυ­ τριεῖς. Bentley.290.
This line is attributed to the παῖς by Junta, Gormont, and Kuster.
Scaliger would read ὒπαγ' ὦ παῖ. ὒπαγ' ὦ naZ, so as to make two complete Ionics a miuore.296.
I have placed the words ὦ παῖ in brackets.
There is nothing to correspond to them in the anti strophe , and they may have been derived from the prefix ΠΑΙΣ which immediately follows.
Bothe reads δήποτε παῖ.297.

Hermann interpolates in the commencement ofthis verse ἒ.ἒ.from the antistrophe :
and he is followed by Mei­ neke and Holden.
But the ejaculation in the antistrophe is plainly extra me­ trum.
συ̂κά pαἰτεῖες. R. V. Better, Din­ dorf, Bothe, recentiores.
νυ̂ν (νυνί. Bent­ ley) συ̂κά μ'αἰτεῖς. Edd. veteres, Weise. νυ̂ν συ̂κ' αὶτεῖς.
Brunck, so converting this speech into three anapæstic dime­ ters.
308.
ίερόν. MSS. vulgo.
ἱρὸν εἰπεῖν. Hermann, D indorf, Holden, and Meineke:
but the addition of εἰπεῖν perverts the sense, and it is far better to omit the words ὦ παῖ in the strophe.
ἱερὸν is dissyllabic.
For "Ελλας (as the word should be written in the text) the old editions had 'Ελλὰς, and R. has Ελας.309.
ἀπαπαῖ φευ̂. ἀπαπαῖ φευ̂. Her­ mann, Dindorf, Bothe, recentiores.

This verse is trans­ ferred to the Chorus by Cobet, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden:
who compensate the boy by giving him the succeedinglines.316.
ἔ, ἔ.Bentley suggested at, αἴ.318.
ύπακούων.MSS. vulgo.
Cobet would prefer ἐπακοὐων, arid Meineke, fol­ lowed by Holden, alters the text accord­ ingly.
But ύπακούεινιs tIle strictly pro­ per word to be used of one who hears from within.
And compare supra 273.

V. Bergk, Richter, Meineke, Holden. Cf. infra 775, and the now commonly re­ ceived reading in Eccl. 420. τὰς Supas. R. vulgo.
τὰς θύρας ἀποκλείοντες καὶ πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν τὰς ἀκοὰς, says St. Chrysostom of the uncharitable (Hom. xxxvii. in Matth. 421 A).
But here both parti­ ciples should govern the σε.338.
ἔφεξιν. R. Schol.

Bent­ ley suggested ὰφέξων (i. e. ἀποκωλύσων), Dobree and Reiske ἐφέξων.
For ὠ μά­ ταιε Burgos proposed ὤν μάταιος, and for δρᾶν Brunck read δρῶν.
ὠμἀταιε seems to be an expression of incredulity on the part of the Chorus.340.
δρᾶν. Brunch suggested δρᾷ μ’.342.

R. P. (in marg.) n. Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk. So (omitting τι) V., and (omitting τι and reading τἀληθὲς) Brunck, Weise.
εἴπερ λέγειςπερὶ τῶν νεῶν ἀληθὲς ἄν. P. (in textu) Edd. veteres.
τἀληθὲς ὄν.
Parson.
The συ is added, metri gratiâ, by Richter, Meineke, and Holden.
Hermann supplied the missing syllable by changing τῶν νεῶν into τελωνειῶν or- Τορωναίων.
For νεῶν
Bentley suggests νέων, as if the hostility of Bdelycleon had been called forth by the dicastic denunciations against the younger generation of whom he is in this Play the special representative.
And so Reiske.
I have made a slight alteration in the division of these lines.
344.
οὐ γὰρ ἂν—τις ἦν.
These lines were formerly given to Philocleon.
Hermann continues them to the Chorus, in which he is followed by Dindorf and all the recent editors.
In 344 R. omits ἄν.
ἐτόλμησεν.

ἐτόλμησε. Edd. veteres.350. ὀπή. ὄπηι. R. ἔνδοθεν οἶός τ’. οἷός τ’ἒνδοθεν.

ᾖς. P.Π. Edd. veteres.
Bentley also proposed to retain ᾖς, and prefix οὐκ to the line.
διορύξαι.
Hesychius mentions that δια­ λέξαι meant the same as διορύξαι.
There­ upon Hermann suggests that διαλέξαι may have been used here.
Thereupon Meineke actually reads διαλέξαι here, and he is as usual followed by Holden.
On such light grounds is the text of Aristo­ phanes corrupted.358.
ἐφύλαττ’. R. V. P. II.
Florent Chretien, Dawes, Brunck, recentiores.
ἐφύλαττεν. Edd. veteres.359. ξὺν ὅπλοις. R. V. P. Π. Dawes, Brunck, recentiores.
σὺν ὅπλοις.
Edd. veteres, so making the first syllable of ὅπλοις long.365.
καὶ νῦν. ‘Malim ἀλλὰ καινήν.
Sed vide Pac. 316, Ran. 734." Dobree. Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.) adopts this conjecture, but does not actually intro­ duce it into the text.
καἰ νῠν is merely an emphatic vvv.378.
ταîν θεαîν. V. vulgo.
τω̂ν θεω̂ν.
R. Dindorf, who however in his notes returns to the received reading.
Cobet and Bergk suggest, and Richter, Mei­ neke, and Holden read, τοîν θεοîν.390.
δακρύοισιν. V. P. Brunck, recen­ tiores.
δακρύοσι. R. Edd. veteres.
ἀεί. R. vulgo. αἰεί. V. and many of the edi­ tions.
This line is accidentally omitted in Grynæus.396.
διαδὺς ἔλαθεν.
Porson, Meineke, Holden. Cf. supra 212.
διαδύεται.MSS.
vulgo, with a syllable short.
Brunck in his text inserted ὄδε after γέρων (and so Weise), but in his notes prefixed ου’ to Bdelycleon's succeeding speech, and so Richter.

Brunck, Bekker, Dindorf, Weise, Bothe, Bergk, Meineke, Holden.
ῥίπτειν is more commonly used in that sense.
R. inserts τὰ between τάχιστα and παιδία.409.
Κλέωνι. ἐλέωνι. V.416.
This line is commonly given to the Chorus, and the next to Bdelycleon.
The latter was restored to the Chorus by Bentley, Tyrwhitt, Gray, Dobree, Din­ dorf, recentiores :
and the last five words of verse 416 were then given to Bdely­ cleon by Dobree, Hamaker, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden.
ως του̂δ ἐγώ. Porson, Meineke, Holden. ὡς του̂δε δ’ οὐ. Yalck. (at Eur. Phœn. 522). ὡς τόνδ’ ἐγώ. vulgo.417.
Hermann adds γε to the end of this line to make it correspond with 474.418.
πόλις. vulgo.
πόλι. R. V. II.
Bekker, Bothe, Bergk. θεοισεχθρία.
Bentley, Brunck, Dobree, Bekker, Din­ dorf, Weise, Meineke, Holden. θεοσεχ­ θρία. V. Edd. veteres, Bothe, Bergk. θεὸς ἐχθρία. R. θεοεχθρία. Φ. Richter reads Θεώροιο θεοσεχθρία.
But the termi­ nation -οιο, though natural enough in the Homeric phraseology of 1519—1521 infra, is quite inadmissible here.
419. ὐμω̂ν. R. V. P. vulgo:
and rightly, since προέστηκεν ὑμω̂ν is equivalent to προστἀτης ἐστὶ του̂ δήμου .
Yet ὴμω̂ν (which is found in II. only) is read by Brunck, Dindorf, Bothe, Holden, and Meineke.423.
ĩεσο. R. V.P. Brunck, recentiores.
ἴεσο. Edd. veteres.435. ᾽ν πέδαις. R. V. (and superscrip­ tum in P.) Kuster, recentiores.

For εἰδῆθ᾽ Junta and Gormont have εἰδεῖθ᾽, and for τρόπος the editions before Scaliger have ὁτρόπος.457.
ἀλλὰ καὶσὺ—Σελαρτίου.
I have followed Bergk in assigning all this to Bdelycleon, who alone would issue the orders for the attack.
Usually this whole line is given to Xanthias, the next to Sosias, and the next to Xanthias again, Meineke spoils Bergk's arrange­ ment by leaving the words ἀλλὰ καὶσὺ to Xanthias.
Holden as usual follows Meineke.458.
οὐχὶ σοῦσθ᾽;
οὐκ. R. V. F. Elmsley (at Ach. 322), Bekker, recentiores.
The editors before Brunck merely omitted the οὐκ, apparently regarding ἄπιτε as an amphibrachys.
For ἄπιτε Bentley sug­ gested ἄπεστε, and Porson ἔτ᾽ ἄπιτε, while Brunck read ἀπίεσθε.461.
BA. So Brunck, Better, Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, and Meineke.
The old editions gavethe speech to the Chorus, Bentley to Sosias, Richter to Xanthias.463.
αὐτὰ δῆλα. R. V. vnlgo.
αὐτόδηλα.
Dindorf, Bothe, Holden, Meineke.471. ἄνευ μάχης.
Meineke proposes ἂν ὲκ, and repeats the suggestion in his Vind.
Aristoph.
For καὶ τῆς Elmsley (at Eur. Med. 102) suggested TIE καί.
But τῆς κατοξείας βοῆς means all that shrill outcry, supra 415.
Hermann pro­ posed ἃνκαί.
For κατοξείας R. writes κατοξίας.472.
ἔλθοιμεν. V. Elmsley (at Eur. Med. 102), Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, Meineke. ἔλθωμεν. R. vulgo.473. σοὶλόγους. R. V. vulgo.
GOVS λόγους (on Dindorf s suggestion).
Holden, Meineke. σοὶ ᾽ς λόγους. Bothe.
For έραστὰ Dindorf reads ἐρῶν, which brings the line into accord with 417 supra, and with the ordinary metre, is supported by the participles in the two following lines, and is probably right.484.
ἆρ᾽ ἂν ὦ. R. Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, recentiores.
ἆρά γ᾽ἄν.V. Edd. veteres.
For ἀπαλλαχθεῖτε V. has ἀπαλ­ λαχθῆτε, and Bentley suggested διαλλαχ­ θῆτε.
For μον the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck have μοι.485.
ἤ. MSS. vulgo.
οὐ. Reiske, Richter.
For μοι, which is the common and MS.
reading, Bothe has μὲν, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden have trot.493.
ὀρφῶς. MSS. Edd. ante Dindorf. Dindorf says" ὀρφὼς reposuiex Athenæo, 7, p. 315 c," and he is followed by every subsequent editor.
But this is a com­ plete misapprehension.
Athenæus cites this line, and undoubtedly writes ὀρφῶς in it with a circumflex.
He then ob­ serves that, notwithstanding this, it was the Attic usage to write the nominative singular ὀρφὼς. (τὴν μέντοι ἑνικὴν εὐθεῖαν ὀξυτόνως προφέρονται ᾽Αττικαὶ), and cites a line of Archippus in which it is so written, and a line of Cratinus where the genitive singular is written ὀρφώ
And so the Scholiast here says, τὸὀρφω̃ς περισπω̑σιν Ἀττικοι.—μήποτε δὲ καὶ τὸ ἑνικὸν τονἴχθύος ἔλεγον ὀρφώς.
The author of the Etym.
Magn. (sub voc.) says that ὀρφῶς is written with a circumflex, and cites Choeroboscus (p. 262. 27, and p. 66.
9) and the great authority of Herodian to the same purpose.
Several other gram­ marians refer to the word, and all with one consent describe it as written with a circumflex.
So far as I know, there is no authority whatever for writing the accusative plural with any other than a circumflex accent.
Hirschig, Meineke. and Holden alter θέλη into ᾽θἐλῃ) here, and θέλω, into ᾽θέλω infra 521.495.
ἔοιχ’ (with ἄνθρωπος).
R. V. Bek­ ker, Dindorf, Bothe, recentiores.
ἔοικ’ (with ἄνθρωπος).
Edd. veteres.496. προσαιτη̑. προσαιτεȋ. R. τις ἀφύαις.
Brunck, Dindorf, recentiores.
ταȋ ἀφύαις. R. V. Edd. veteres, with which Acharnians, 318, is compared.
ἥδυσμά τι. R. V. vulgo.
ἡδύσματα (from a hesitating conjecture of Dobree, who also suggested ἥδυσμά τις).
Bergk, Rich­ ter, Meineke, Holden.
This they support by a reference to Knights, 678 (where Agoracritus bays up ἄπαντα τὰ γήτει’ ὅσ’ ἦν ἐν τἀγορᾷ, and other condiments, ταȋς ἀφύαις ἡδύσματα), not observing that γήτεια could, and γήτειον could not, be properly described as ἡδύσματα.497. θατέρῳ. Elmsley (at Ach. 828) would read θατέρᾳ adverbially.
But παραβλέψασα θατέρῳ means “ shooting a sidelong glance out of one eye," τῷ έτέρῳ ὀφθαλμῷ χαλεπῶς ὑποβλεψαμένη, as the Scholiast explains it.
The same expression is found in Eccl. 498 (παρα­ βλέπουσα θατέρῳ), where the Scholiast gives a like explanation.501.
ὅτι. Dindorf proposed ὅτε.503. ἡδέ’ Et. R. V. Suidas (s. v. εἰ καὶ νῦν), Francini, Scaliger, Beaker, Dindorf, Bothe, recentiores.
ἡδέα γε. Edd. veteres.

F. For νῦν Mcineke reads νῦν γ’, and is followed by Holden.504.
ὅτι. Suidas (ubi supra), Aid., Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.

τυραννικά.
V. Suidas (ubi supra and s. v. ξυνωμύτης), Porson, Bekker, Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, Meineke.
τυραννίδα.
R. vulgo.
Compare φρονήματι τυραννικῷ in Theodoret, Eccl. Hist. v. 32, which is exactly equivalent to φρονῶν τυραννικὰ, and does not mean, as Vales takes it, fastu tyrannico.
For ὣν in this line Valcknaer at Hdt. i. 59 would substitute ὣς.510.
ἐγχέλεσιν. Athenæus vii. cap. 54, Porson, Dindorf, reeentiores, except Bothe.
ἐγχέλυσιν. vulgo.522.
ΦΙ.
The line and a half here given to Philocleon are continued to Bdelycleon in the MSS.
and early edi­ tions.
They were transferred to Philo­ cleon by Bergler (note on 714), who is followed by Dindorf and all subsequent editors.
526.
νῦν Si. n. Porson, Dindorf, Holden, and Meineke.
So Fritzsche at Thesm.
529. νῦν δέ. R. V. vulgo.
Brunck, preferring νῦν δὴ quod ad sen­ tentiam præstaretlonge etessetoptimum, was under the erroneous impression that it did not suit the metre, and therefore proposed νῦν σε, which Richter adopts.527.
λέγειν τι δεῖ. MSS. vulgo.
δεῖ τι λέγειν. Bentley, Porson, Diudorf (in notes), Weise, Holden, Meineke.529.
κίστην. κακιστήν.
R. Brunck and Bothe remove this and the succeed­ ing line to the end of the ensuing chorus.530.
ἀτάρ.
This line is given to the Chorus in the MSS.
and old editions.
It is continued to Bdelycleon by Her­ mann (at Clouds, 759), Dindorf, recen­ tiores (except Bothe).
For ποῖός τις Bergler, Brunck, and Bothe would read παιάς τις in the sense of οὐχ 6 τυχών.
For ταυ̑τα R. has ταυ̑τ’αὺτὰ, V. ταυ̑τα αὐτά.533. τάνδε. MSS. vulgo.
τονδί.
Bent­ ley, Porson, Dindorf (in notes), Weise.
For λέγειν Hirschig, Meineke, and Holden read λάγων.534.
ἔϭτ’' ἀγὼν vvv. Bentley, Porson. ἔϭτ’ ἀγών. R. Y. Scaliger, Bergler, Brunck, Bergk. ἐϭτὶν ἀγών. Edd. veteres, Bothe. ἐϭτὶν ἁγών. Elmsley (at Eur. Heracl. 722), Dindorf, Weise, Hol­ den, and Meineke.
And this I should have preferred but that the νυ̑ν which is found in the MSS.
at the end of verse 536 has probably dropped there from this place.
Richter, regardless of the requirements of the metre, reads ἐϭτὶν ἀγὼν νυ̑ν.536.
γένοιθ᾽ οὗτός ϭ᾽ Porson, Dindorf, Weise, Holden, Richter, Meineke.
And Bentley had previously suggested the same, except that he had y᾽ for ϭ᾽ γένοιτο νυ̑ν οὗτος.MSS.

Meineke inserts a comma before and after this word, treating it as an imperative.542.

These are obvious interpolations.
Meineke further, interpolates παιϭὶν between ἄν and ἐν, and is followed by Holden.545.

κακὰ K.T.X. So Bothe, Hermann, Holden, and Meineke.
And so (with ἀνιῶν for ἀνιὼν) Dindorf, Bergk, and Richter.
This appears to be the real read­ ing of V., for it seems to have been by a mere oversight that Bekker gives, from that MS., παρισώση for ἂνἰσώση.
R. and P. have the same, omitting ἀνιών.
The editions before Brunck had κακάγε πρὸς τοῖσιναὔσινἕως ἂν ἰσώση τοῖσιν ἐμοῖσιν.
Brunck reduced this to metrical pro­ priety by making the γε follow τοῖσιν and changing ἰσὼση into παρισώσηReisig changes ἀνιὼν into κλάων Hamaker into λήγων.

The two latter alterations are approved by Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.).577. ἅχεις. ἄχρις. R. V. F. τῆς 'EX­ λάδος ἄρχειν. R. Francini, Scaliger, Kus­ ter, recentiores.

The two former critics decide for the active, the latter for the middle form.
Either would seem to be allow­ able :
but in Aristophanes, at all events, the whole weight of MS.

The older editions gave the whole of this line to Bdelycleon, and the next line and a half, from ἐς τούτους to ἀεὶ, to Philocleon.
The ar- rangement in the text is due to Bothe and Dobree, and is adopted by Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Holden, and Meineke.680.

πρῴ. Before Brunck this was written πρωἶ.691.
δραχμήν.
There seems no reason to doubt that the first syllable of δραχμὴ is common, and there is no need, when it is long, to read δαρχμὴ or δραγμή.
Still less is it desirable to rewrite the line (with Cobet) τὸ συνηγορικὸν, κἂν πάντων ὕστατος ἔλθῃ.694.

This is the reading of the MSS.
and all the editors except Bothe, Meineke, and Holden.
Suidas (s. v. νάρκη) quotes the line with πέπονθ᾽ contra metrum for ποθ᾽.
Kuster sug­ gested that if we changed ὥσπερ into ὡς, we might .read πέπονθ᾽ here:
and this was approved by Bentley and Porson.
Dindorf observed that another way of getting rid of the extra syllable would be to omit τη̑ς ;
and this is done by Bothe :
whilst Meineke (followed by Holden) omits κατά.
However, if Suidas is to be corrected at all, the simplest correction would seem to be ποθ᾽ for πέπονθ᾽, in ac­ cordance with all the Aristophanic MSS.718.
ἔλαβες. ἔλαβε. R. F. ἔλαβεν. Φ.
The old editions divided this line into two.

Bergler set the matter right in his translation, and then Brunck in his text.

This introduces an additional alternative.
"Ifit snows, you shall judge (ἡλιάσει) by the fire;
if it rains, εἴσει.”
The suggestion is plausible:
but on the whole it seems more probable (especially having regard to the introductory εὐλό­ γως) that there is no alternative without a play upon words.786.
ὁτιὴ .... λήψομαι.
This line, absent in all the earlier editions, was first added by Brunck from n., and has since been found in R. V. φ. Between this and the following line Bothe inserts the words κἂν γὰρ πυρέττω τόν γε μισθόν λήψομαι, removing them from their pro­ per position, infra 813.790. κἄπειτ’ ἐπέθηκε. R. vulgo. κἀπει­ θεν ἔθηκε. V. κἄπειτ’ ἐνέθηκε is preferred by Bergk and Meineke, and read by Holden.794.

This verse, which is usually con­ tinued to Philocleon, is transferred to Bdelycleon by Bergk, Meineke, and Hol­ den, who also transfer the following verse from Sosias to Philocleon.
825.
This and the following verse are omitted by V., the transcriber's eye pass­ ing from the δίκην in 824 to the δίκην in 826.
For νυν R. and one or two old edi­ tions have νῦν.
κάθημαι ’γώ.

ἐν τᾠκίᾳ.
ἐν τῃ̑ οἰκίᾳ.
R. V. Edd. veteres.
Dindorf wrote it ἐν τᾠκἰᾳ, but himself preferred ἐν οἰκίᾳ, which is adopted by Bothe and Richter.828.
Dobree would give this verse to the servant, as an answer to Bdelycleon's question.
For προσκαύσασα Florent Chre­ tied suggested προσθραύσασα.832.
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ—ἔνδοθεν.
In the old editions these words are continued to Bdelycleon, but they are rightly taken from him and assigned to Philocleon by Beer, Bergk, and Richter.
In addition to this, Hermann (followed by Meineke and Holden) changes the words τί ποτε τό χρη̑μ’ of the following line into ὅ,τι ποτὲ χπη̑μ’, and gives them also to Philo­ cleon, omitting the stop after ἔνδοθεν:
a change every way for the worse.842.
εἰσάμῃ. MSS. vulgo.
εἰσαγάμῃ, Bergk, Richter, Holden.
The alteration is approved by Meineke, and is probable enough.
See supra 826;
Peace, 439, &c.844-6. τουτὶ τί ἐστι;
—ἐπιτρίψω τινά.
The arrangement of the text is that of Bergk, followed by Richter, Meineke, and Holden.
The sentences here assigned to Bdelycleon were formerly given to Philo­ cleon:
whilst those here assigned to Philocleon were given to the servant by the editions before Brunck, and to Bdely­ cleon by Brunck, Bekker, Dindorf, Weise, and Bothe.
But it is plain that the per­ son who went into the house after verse 833 returns here with the χοιροκομεῖον, and it is equally plain from verse 839 that Bdelycleon is on the stage during the interval, whilst the language assigned to the person who brings the χοιροκομεῖον suits neither the servant nor Bdelycleon, but Philocleon alone.
851.
BA. ἰδού. φΙ. κάλει νυν. V. Berg­ ler, recentiores.
In the older editions all three words were ascribed to Philo­ cleon.
R. gives them all to Bdelycleon.861.
καὶ μυρρίνας.
This line is omitted in V.869.
BA. εὐφημία.
This line, which is rightly given to Bdelycleon by the MSS.
and editions, is transferred to the Chorus by Meineke, Holden, and Richter:
the latter compensating Bdelycleon by giv­ ing him the succeeding line.870. o. οὐ. V.875. προθύρου προπύλαιε.
Bentley.
The editions before Brunck had προθύρου πρός πύλας.
Brunck left a gap after προθύρου (in which he is followed by Bekker), observing that the words πρός πύλας seemed to be a gloss which had crept into the place of the genuine read­ ing.
In a supplementary note he hit upon the same emendation as Bentley, remarking “ ad illud προπύλαιε glossa erat πρός πύλας ἱδρυμένε.
Hinc lectionis depravatio."
Porson observes that Sca­ liger (at Virgo Culic. p. 8, ed. 1595) had suggested τοὐμοῦ προθύρου προπύλαιος, and Dobree cites Ἑρμη̑ς προπύλαιος (see the note on 804 supra) from Pausa­ nias, i. p. 53.
Bentley's emendation is adopted by Invernizzi, Dindorf, Conz, Weise, Bothe, and Richter, and is un­ doubtedly right.
προθύρου προσθπύλας.
It. προυπὐλου πρ

After ξυνευχόμεσθα
Din­ dorf suggested the insertion of ταυ̂τα or ταύτὰto complete the line :
the former is adopted by Bergk and Richter, the lat­ ter by Meineke and Holden.
Hermann also suggested .aCra, and so Reisig, who proposed to commence the line with it.
After ὲπάδομεν an ὲν is added by R., Edd. before Bekker, and Bothe:
and Brunck further inserts σοί γ' between ὲπᾴδομεν and ὲν.886.

Edd. veteres.
τω̑ν γενναιοτέρων.
R. V. F.
The reading is varied in accordance with the reading of 873 supra, the correspond­ ing line in the strophe.
After this line Meineke (followed by Holden) intro­ duces the words 'ΙήïεΠαίαν.891.
θύρασιν. R. Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, recentiores.
θύραισιν. V. Edd. veteres.893. τίςα̑́ρ́. V. vulgo.
τίς α̋ρα.
R. F. Dobree doubtfully suggests that ου̉τος should be transferred to Bdelycleon, and this suggestion is adopted by Bergk, Meineke, and Holden.
But it is clear that Labes is not presented to the Court until six lines later:
and ου̑́τος seems to be used merely by way of depreciation. "
Where is that fellow, the defendant? " For ο̋σον Dobree suggests olov, and Reiske ο̋σου, whilst Bergler places a note of interrogation after άλώσεται, and takes it as a question to the servant, who re­ sponds τίμημα κλῳὸς σύκινος.
But ο̋σον is equivalent to ὡςwith an intensified signification, just as πόσονδοκει̑ς is used in Eccl.
399 and elsewhere for the more ordinary πω̑ς δοκει̑ς.894.
The characters in the trial scene are variously distributed by the editors :
but it seems to me that all the parts belonging to the κήρυξ or the θεσμοθέτης are most properly assigned to Bdelycleon.
The present speech is given by R. and the old editions to ΘΕ., which Brunck (apparently taking it for θεράπων, as Meineke also does) changed into Xan­ thias.
ΘΕ. however stands for θεσμο­ θέτης, who is one of the Dramatis Per­ sonæ in the old editions, and the speech is rightly assigned to Bdelycleon by Elmsley, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden.
I do not think it necessary to notice all the minor variations in the prefixes throughout this scene.

Αίξωνέα. έξωνέα. Junta.
Not­ withstanding the observations in the note, it may be that the word Αίξωνέα is merely a puuning allusion to παρᾴξας supra 837:
in which case we must sup­ pose the Platonic Laches to be referring to this very passage.900.
καὶ is omitted by V., and κλέπτον is accentuated κλεπτὸν by R. For ω̑́ μιαρὸς Florent Chretien suggested ώς μιαρὸς, and Reiske ὸμιαρός.902.
All the MSS.
and early editions commence the line either with που̑ δ' ό (R. Kuster, Bergler, Brunck, Beaker, Bergk), which is contra metrum, or with που̑ δού or που̑ δόὐ (V. φ. Edd. veteres), an impossible crasis.
The Scholiast not only has the reading που̑8' ó, but gravely maintains that 6 is sometimes long.
Various emendations have been proposed:
ὸύκδιώκων (for 6 έκδιώκων) by Florent Chretien and Bentley:
που̑ δ' έσθ' ó by Toup, Porson, Weise, Richter:
που̑ 'στιν 6 or που̑ που̑ 'orB' ό(Plutus, 865;
Frogs, 288) by Dobree;
the latter is adopted by Holden:
που̑ μοὺ by Dindorf:
που̑ 8' ου̑́νό(which I have followed) by Bothe, who himself reads που̑ δὴ δ́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́́̕̕̕̕̕':
που̑ που̑ δ' ó by Lenting and Meineke.
The line is transferred to Bdelycleon by Elmsley and Dindorf.903.
KY.
αυ̑́αυ̑́.R. gives this and the next verse entirely to Bdelycleon, repeat­ ing ου̑̕τος twice.
And all but αυ̑́αυ̑́ιs usually given to him.
Dobree trans­ ferred ἕτερος—χύτραςto Philoeleon, and he is followed by Dindorf, Weise, Bergk, and Richter.
I think they belong to Sosias.
Meineke (followed by Holden) puts αυ̑́extra metrum, then gives to Bdelycleon πάρεστιν ου̑̀̕̕τος, and leaves ἕτερος—χύτρας to Philoeleon.904.
άγαθός y. F. omits y.905.
σίγα.
This line is given to Bdely­ cleon by Tyrwhitt, Elmsley, Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
Kv. (for κύων) is pre­ fixed in Gormont and the succeeding editions until Scaliger:
Κη. (for κήρυξ) in Junta, Scaliger, Kuster, and Bergler.
Brunck made it Σωσίας ώς κήρυξ, and Sosias is retained by Bekker, Weise, and Bothe.907.
τη̑ς μὲν γραφη̑ς.
This speech is attributed to ΘΕ. in R. and the early editions.
It is given to Xanthias by Brunck and all recent editors.
For η̑́ν Brunck, Bothe, Richter, Meineke, and Holden write η̑́ς.
P. has an σ written over the η̋ν.914.
κούμετέδωκ̓. R. and the early editions omit the prefix Xanthias, which was added by Brunck after a suggestion of Sealiger.
R. " versum inferiorem alteri tribuit," says Bekker.917.

For τω̢̑ κοινω̢̑ γ̕ ὲμοὶ R. has τω̹̑ κυνωι γέ μοι, and Dobree suggested τω̑ν κοινω̑ν ὲμοί.
There was no break in this verse in the MSS.
and early editions.
But Brunck severed the words ούδὲ τῳ̑κοινῳ̑γ' ὲμοὶ from the rest of the verse, and assigned them to Xan­ thias.
He is followed by Bekker, Din­ dorf, Weise, Bothe, and Richter.
But κοινῳ̑can hardly mean κοινωνῳ̑, as the Scholiast supposes, nor if it could, would it yield a very clear or appropriate mean­ ing.
The recent editors have therefore returned to the common and (I am per­ suaded) the genuine reading.918.
ἁνήρ. Before Dindorf this was written ἀνήρ.921.
γὰρ is omitted by R.922.
μή νυν.
The prefix is OIK.
in R., Θε. in the early editions.
The speech is given to Xanthias by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
For ἀφη̑τέ γ'αύτὸν Cobet proposed, and Richter, Meineke, and Holden read, άφη̑τ' ἒτ'αύτόν.
Bergk would write the line τουτον, ὡς ο̋ντ' ἐν πολει.

διακενη̑ς was written as one word in the editions before Dindorf.932.

κατηγόρευσε. R. (" ni fallor," says Bekker) vulgo.936.
αύτὸς καθελου̑.
This speech is given to Bdelycleon by R. Bekker, and recent editors:

to Sosias by V. Brunck, Weise, and Bothe.937.

Before this word P. has a line drawn, and II.
has the prefix φΙΑ.
So Brunck and Bothe, the former read­ ing κούκαθίζεις.941.
του̑τον. Given to Philocleon by R. V. P. Bentley, Tyrwhitt, Dobree, Brunck, recentiores.
Before Brunck it was continued to the preceding speech.
For οἰ̑μ' ἐγὼ Bekker, Weise, and Richter have οἰ̑μαι 'γώ.
χεσει̑σθαι, præ timore, as Bergler says.942.

Dobree refers to Knights, 335, 8. οὐκ α̋ν. V. Edd. veteres, Bothe. Reisig conjec­ tured οὒκουν, which Richter and Holden adopt.944. ἀνάβαιν’.
R. gives this line to Philocleon, and the next to Bdelycleon.
So the old editions, which also give 946-8 (οὒκ ἀλλ’—γνάθους) to Philocleon.
Correxit Brunck.957.
ὅτι.MSS. vulgo.
ὅ,τι;
Dobree, Holden, Richter, Meineke:
a very pro­ bable alteration.958.
el δ’ ὑφείλετο.
Scaliger gives these three words to Philocleon, placing a note of interrogation after them.960.
ἐγὼ δ’.
Scaliger continues this and the following line to Bdelycleon.961.
ἐνέγραφ’.
MSS. vulgo.
Cobet suggests ἔγραφεν, and Meineke, followed by Holden, alters the text accordingly.
But ἐνέγραφ’ ἡμῖν means " inflicted on us this written oration.
"962. ΦΙΛ. ἄκουσον.
This speech is ascribed to Κυ. by R., and to θε. by the editions before Brunck, which however give the words φησὶ κατακνηη̑σαι to Bdely­ cleon.
δαιμόνιέ μου. R. V. F. Bekker, recentiores, except Weise. δαιμόνι’ ἐμοῦ. cetcri.967. ἐλέει ταλαιπωρουμένους. vulgo.
ἐλέει τοὺς ταλαιπωρ
ουμένους. R. Y. F. Dindorf (who writes it ἔλει, but in his notes returns to the common reading), Bergk, Richter, Meineke, Holden.
Bentley pro­ posed to read ὦ δαῖμον, and this is approved by Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.), who supposes the speaker to be address­ ing Lycus.
But see 962 supra.970.
οἰκουρός. MSS. vulgo.
Brunck suggested οἰκουρεῖν, and Meineke, fol­ lowed by Holden, alters the text accord­ ingly.
For μóvov V. has μόνος. R. pre­ fixes ό Φιλ. to the line.973.
τι κακόν.vulgo.
τίτόκακόν. R. V. Bothe. So Richter, omitting the ποτ'.
Hamaker, also omitting nor, gives τί TO κακόν;

Meineke men­ tions with approbation a proposal to add γε after γνώμην, and Holden adds it.985.

ἀποφεύγῃ. Edd. veteres.991. ὄδ' ἔσθ'. ἴδεσθ'. V. 'ντευθενί. MSS. vulgo.
Cf. Eccles. 169. 'νταῦθ' ἔνι. Dobree (comparing Œd. Tyr. 598), Holden, Bergk, Richter, Meineke.993. φέρ' ἐξεράσω.
Originally this whole line was ascribed to Philocleon, but Dobree perceived that these two words must belong to another speaker, and they are accordingly transferred to Bdelycleon by Bergk, Richter, Meineke, and Holden.
πῶς ἅρ'.
R. V. Bekker, recentiores.
πῶς yάρ.
Edd. veteres.995.
οἴμοι ποῦ 'σθ' ὕδωρ.
Scaliger proposed to transfer these words to Bdelycleon;
and this is done by Weise and Holden.
Dobree would leave οἴμοι to Philocleon, and assign the rest to Bdelycleon.996.
ἔπαιρε σαυτόν. Y. Dindorf, recen­ tiores, except Richter, who with R. and the older editions reads ἔπαιρ' ἔπαιρε σαυτόν.
This necessitates the omission of νυν, which is omitted by Φ. Vat. Aid. Junta, Kuster, Bergler, Brunck, Bekker, and Richter:
but νυν is found in R. Y. F. and the other editions, the older ones retaining it contra metrum.1010.
δὲ Teas.
R. V. Bekker, recen­ tiores.
Be ταχέως.
F. δέ, γε ταχέως.
Edd. veteres.
Brunck read ταχέως, putting a colon after the word, and adding δ' to μυριάδες.
The middle syllable of ἀναρίθ.
μητοι is long, contrary to the common usage in Aristophanes, doubtless because the phrase is adopted from some poet who (as afterwards Antipater in the passage cited in the note) had so used it.1011.
νῦν μέν.
Burges proposed to omit μέν.
Dindorf in his notes approving this would also read ἐξευλαβεῖσθε for εὐλαβεῖσθε, so as to make the lines tro­ chaic.
Bergk in his notes follows
Din­ dorf, whilst Meineke introduces Burges's alteration into his text.
The last two lines of the Commation are translated by Bergler nam pravorum est spertatorum id committere et non vestrûm.
And so (with inscitorum for pravorum) Brunck.
But it is perhaps better to supply πρὸς before σκαιῶν θεατῶν, and to translate, " This is a fate which a poet would expect at the hands of foolish spectators, and not at your hands.

Bentley suggested φήϭ̕̕ ἐπιθέϭ­ θαι, understanding the passage to mean that the παιδικὰ had been satirized by some other poet, and that the lover came to Aristophanes to induce him to take up the quarrel:
a meaning which is possible even with the existing text.1028.

κυνὸς is an old reading mentioned by the Scholiast:

V. and F. have οἵδ̕ ἐπανθοῦϭι τρίχας, V. adding in the margin οἱ κρόταΦοι. So Suidas s.v. κύκνυ.
The Scholiast too says, οἱ δὲ διαιροῦϭιν ἀπ̕ἄλλης ἀρχῆςτοῦτο, “οἳδ̕ ἐπανθοῦϭι τρίχας," ἵν̕ᾖπερἰ τω̂ν νεωτέρωνολόγος. καὶ γὰρ τὰἐξη̑ς περὶ αὐτω̑ν φηϭι.

In the old editions the words ἤ τις were added to the pre­ ceding line.
They were brought down to this line by Florent Chretien, Kuster, recentiores.
This line therefore became two syllables too long (for τῆϭδε was formerly inserted before τῆς), and ἐϭτιν was omitted by Florent Chretien, Bent­ ley, Weise, Bothe, Bergk.
Bentley also suggested the omission of ἡμω̂ν, and so Porson, Brunck, Bekker, Richter, and Holden.
In V. and Φ., however, the τη̂σδε is omitted:
and so Dindorf and Meineke:

This and the following line are transposed by Hamaker and Meineke;
but though I had myself already transposed them in my translation, yet I have no doubt that they are rightly arranged in the text.
Line 1088 seems to be inserted for the express purpose of recalling the image of the Wasps (which had been rather lost sight of in the preceding lines) as an introduction to the statement with which the Epirrhema closes.

Before Brunck this was written φέρε, ἀλλ'.1157.
ἀποδύου. vulgo.
ὑποδύου. R. V. F. Instead of the verbs ἀποδύεσθαι here and ὑποδύεσθαι in lines 1158, 1159, and 1168, Hirschig (anticipated by Scaliger in the last two passages) proposes to substitute ὑπολύεσθαι here, and ὑποδεῖσθαι in the other places.
The proposal is an ingenious and plausible one;
but it is certainly unnecessary:
it involves four alterations of the MS.
text;
and I am not sure that the use of the one verb δύεσθαι in different compounds (slip out of those, and slip into these) is not more suited to the tone of the dialogue.
In the present line Hirschig's ὑπολύου is followed by Cobet (N. L. p. 789), Meineke, and Hol­ den.

πεπόρδει. ’πεπόρδει. Brunck, Weise, Bothe, Meineke, Holden.
For κατεγέλα Dindorf proposed κἀγελα, Meineke κᾆτ’ ἔφλα, both obvious changes for the worse.
Meineke (followed by Holden) transposes this and the follow­ ing verse:
he recants, however, in his Vind.
Aristoph.1307.
δή με. vulgo.
δὴ is omitted, contra metrum, in R. V., and by Bekker.
Elmsley (at Ach. 127) proposed either κἄτυπτεν ἐμὲ (which Dindorf adopts) or κἂτυπτενώ.
Richter, for no imaginable reason, corrupts κἂτυπτειnto τἂπαιε.1310.
ἀχυρω̂νας. vulgo.
But ἀχυρὼν is not elegant Attic, and consequently χυρονιs read, contra metrum, in R. V., and by Bekker and Dindorf.
The latter suggested ἀχυρμὸν, which is approved by Bergk, and adopted by Richter, Meineke, and Holden.
The proverb however, as preserved by the Scholiast, is ὄνος εἰς ἀχυ­ ρω̂να ἀπέδρα, and Aristophanes may be reasonably supposed to have preserved its actual language.

Dobree rightly says,“ Non Bdely­ cleon sed unus τῶν ἐπακολουθούντων.
But Boer suggests XOP., and he is followed by Meineke and Holden.
Bergk pro­ poses κατήγορος.1335.
ἰὴ ἰεῦ.
Dindorf would read ἰὴ, ἰὴ, Bergk ἰεῦ, ἰεῦ, both changes for the worse.1338.
ἰαιβοι. R. vulgo.
V. omits this word:
and so Meineke, who inserts οὐκέτ’ before ἀνέχομαι.
Bothe omits αἰβοῖ, and Dindorf suggests ἰαὶ, ἰαιβοῖ.1339.
τάδε. ταδί. Brunck.
For βάλλε V. has βάλε.1340.
ἂπεισι. R. V. F. Φ. vulgo.

Meineke how­ ever in his notes, and also in his Vind.
Aristoph., proposes ἀποίσεις.
ἂπει. Weise.
γὰρ is added in Φ., in the editions down to and including Brunck, and by Bothe.
For ποῦ ‛στιν Brunck and Weise have ποῦ ’σθ’.
The liue is apparently a tro­ chaic dimeter:
and if so, two syllables have dropped out, which Dindorf would supply by reading ποῦ ’στι ποῦ ’στιν, Hermann by reading ποῦ 'στιν ἡμῖν.
In his text Meineke (followed by Holden) adopts Hermann's suggestion:
but in his Vind.
Aristoph.
he prefers Dindorf's.
Bergk would read ποῦ ’στιν ὃδὁφιλη­ λιαστής.1348.
οὐδὲ φιαλεῖς.
R. V. P. vulgo. ἀλλὰ φιαλεῖς. II. οὐδ’ ἐφιαλεῖς (from Eustathius on Odyssey, i. p. 1403).

And this is probably the true way of spelling the word both here and in Peace, 432.1360.

R. has a lacuna for δα̨δός.1386.

Query if we should not also read κμτ'ἐπιθήκην, taking ἐπιθήκην (by analogy to θήκη, ἀποθήκη, and the like) to mean the tray which the baking-girl car­ lied on her head.
1392.
ὁρᾳ̑ς α δέδρακας.
The earlier editions connect πράγματ' αὖ with these words :
but πράγματα and δίκας clearly go together, as infra 1426, Demosthenes (cited in the note on 521 supra), and frequently elsewhere.
And so all recent editors punctuate the line.1395.
ὥστ οἰ̑δ'.
Meineke (Vind. Aris­ toph.) would omit this line, whilst Hamaker changes ὥστ' into εὖ, and omits the preceding line.1405.
δοκοι̑ς.

δόκεις is suggested by Florent Chretien and Bergk.1412.
ἄληθες.
This and the two follow­ in, lines are given to βδελ.
or θερ. by R., to βδελ.
by the early editions.
They were first divided rightly by Tyrwhitt and Brunck.1413.
κλητεύεις ἐοικώς.
The MSS.
and editions before Brunck uniformly read κλητεύειν ἐοικώς.
Bergler suggests κλη­ τεύεις, whilst Brunck, without remark, follows Reiske in changing ἐοικὼς into ἔοικας.
This change is adopted by every subsequent editor:
but Brunck's reading has the effect of transferring the imputa­ tion of corpse-like pallor from Chærephon (for whom it was obviously intended) to the Baking-girl.
Dobree therefore sug­ gested the further change of κλητεύων for κλητεύων, and this is followed by Bergk, Richter, Meineke, and Holden.
This however involves a double departure from the MS.
reading, and I think it better to read κλητεύεις, ἐοικὼς, placing (with all the early editions) a comma after κλητεύεις, and adding (instead of the usual full stop) a note of interroga­ tion after Εὐριπίδου.
For ἐοικὼς Bentley suggested ἐωθώς.1415.
ὁδί.
This speech is given to the servant by R. and the editions before Brunck.1417.

V. Brunck, re­ centiores.
EY. (Εὐριπίδης).
Edd. veteres, and so the Scholiast.
Π prefixes ἀνήρ τις to this line, and Εὐριπίδης to the next.
R. omits the prefix here and 1426, whilst P. omits all prefixes from 1370.
οἴμοι. V. Brunck, recentiores.
ὤμοι or ᾤμοι.R. Edd. veteres.
Bothe and Holden continue the words οἴμοι κυκοδυαίμων to Bdelycleon, and so Meineke in his notes.and so Relate had conjectured.1429.

At Hamaker's suggestion Meineke trans­ fers this line to a place between 1440 and 1441.1434.

In order to divert this speech (which is obviously intended for Bdelyeleon) to the κλητὴρ, Dobree punctuates, μέμνησ’, αὐτὸς ἁπεκρί­ νατο, whilst Meineke (followed by Holden) changes αὐτὸς into οὗτος.1437.

Brunck says, "
Hæc verba dicens filius sublimem medium patrem abripit:
hie incertus quid filius in ammo habeat, sermonem illius abrumpens percunctatur τί ποιεῖς ;
respondet ille εἴσω Φέρω σ’ ἐντευ̑θεν, unde liquet eum jam ante dicere non debuisse οἴσω σε.”
It seems to me, on the contrary, that the change of tense is not only tolerable, but necessary.
Bdelycleon says, " You shall not stay here, I will take you up and carry yon—” and then to his father's question τί ποιεῖς he replies " I am carrying you in."1449.

Vulgo absurde πτήσσει.” Brunck. " Nisi cum Bentleio πλήσσει pro πτήσσει scribas, locus intelligi non potest."
Meineke, Vind.
Aristoph.
Rich­ ter's note is worth preserving for its very absurdity:
“ πτήσσει magis placet, non enim galli est πτήσσειν sed πτήσσειν po­ tius alis, quando canturus est atque alias sæpissime.”
It is, however, very noteworthy that Bentley does not repeat this conjecture in his marginal jottings on the Wasps:
and I certainly, on the whole, prefer πτήσσει.
See the note.
For ὥς τις V. has ο̑́ς τις.1491.
βαλλήσεις V. vulgo.
βαλλήση. R. Bergk, not perceiving the drift of the dialogue, proposed βαλλήσει, which Meineke in his Vind.
Aristoph.
approves.1492. οὐράνιόν γ’. vulgo.
οὐράνιον. R. V. contra metrum.
Dindorf refers to Hesychius s. v. οὐρανίαν, and Meineke in his Vind. Aristoph., following out the suggestion, proposes with some plausi­ bility to read οὐρανίαν here.1496.
οὐκ εὗ.
Dobree ingeniously sug­ gests that these two words should be added to Philocleon's speech, and be followed by a note of interrogation, OVK εὗ ;
is not that done well ?
And he corn.
pares Peace, 1230, οὗ δεξιῶς;
I very much incline to this alteration.
It is approved also by Meineke, and adopted by Holden.
LAnd so Mr. Green.] μανικὰπράγματα, 'mad goings on.
All the speeches of Bdelycleon henceforth are transferred by Beer and Bergk to Xanthias.1509.
ὸξίς. MSS. vulgo.
Meineke (Yind. Aristoph.) conjectures ώτίς.

μοί. σὺδέ.
This is Hermann's felicitous emendation.
μ’ῴζυρέ. R. Y. Bekker, Dindorf. ῴζυρέ. vulgo.
Mei­ neke (followed by Holden) adopts Her­ mann's conjecture.
Bentley gave the verse to Bdelycleon.1518.
In the old editions lines 1518— 1527 are attributed to one semichorus, and lines 1528 ad fin. to the other.
The words ἂγ'ὦ—ψάμαθον are added in the margin of R. by a later hand.1519.
θαλασοίοιο. Dindorf, Richter.
θαλασσίου. R. V. vulgo, contra metrum.
θαλασσίου θεοῠ. Bergk:
and this mon­ strous suggestion is actually followed by Meineke and Holden.1521.
άτρυγέτοιο. R. V. vulgo :
and the epic form is rightly used (as indeed the metre requires) in this epic phrase.
Strange to say, Dindorf, who in 1519rightly altered the unmetrical θαλασσίου into θαλασσίοιο, here alters back ὰτρυγέ­ τοιο into the unmetrical ὰτρυγέτου, and so Weise and Meineke.
Weise indeed, misunderstanding the metre, makes various alterations not worth record­ ing.1536.
ήμᾰς. R. A. vulgo. ύμᾰς.
Bent­ ley, Bergk.
Meineke approved this in his notes, and Holden adopted it, but in his Yind.
Aristoph.
Meineke rightly reverts to ήμᾰς.1537.
ὸρχούμενος, ὃστις.
F. Richter, Mei­ neke (in his notes and Vind. Aristoph.), Holden.
ὸρχούμενον ὃστις.

τρυγῳδὣν. R. V. Scaliger, recentiores.
τραγῳδῶν.
P. Π. Φ. Edd. veteres.
Bentley's interpretation of this line can hardly be right:
“ Sic distingue, ὸρχούμενον, ὃστις άπήλλαξεν, χορὸν τραγῳ­ δῶν, Nemo, qui hoc fecit choro tragico, evasit, i. e. impune habuit."
But I can­ not take leave of that great critic without observing (what any one who examines this Appendix will perceive) that his mere marginal jottings have done far more for the text of Aristophanes than has been accomplished by the united efforts of all the commentators, both before and since his time.
[I regret that I have not availed myself of the very useful edition of the Wasps brought out by Mr. Green in the Catena Classicorum.
I was under the impression that the volumes in that series were mere compilations for the use of schools ;
but Mr. Green's edition of the Wasps (which has now happened to come into my hands) is obviously the well-considered and independent work of a judicious and competent scholar.
Mr. Green had already, I see, referred to the passage of the Menexenus which I have cited in the note to 639.
