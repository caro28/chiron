and a powerful people turning with victorious right-hand against its own vitals, and kindred armies engaged;
and, the compact of rule rent asunder', a contest waged with all the might of the shaken earth for the universal woe, and standards meeting with hos­ tile standards, the eagles alike 2, and darts threatening darts
What madness, this, 0 citizens!
what lawlessness so great of the sword, while nations are your hate, for you to shed the Latian blood ?
And, while proud Babylon was to be spoiled 4 of the Ausonian trophies, and the shade of Crassus was wan­ dering unavenged, has it pleased you that wars, doomed to produce no triumphs, should be waged ?
Alas!
how much of land and of sea might have been won with that self-same blood which the right-hands of fellow-citizens have shed.
Whence Titan makes his approach, and where the night con­ ceals the stars, and where the mid-day intensely bums with its scorching moments;
where too, the winter, frozen and un­ used to be relaxed by the spring, binds fast the icy ocean with Scythian cold!
By this beneath the yoke should the Seres 5, by this the barbarian Araxes8, have come, and the race, if any there be, that lies situate contiguous to the rising Nile 7.
Then, Rome, if so great thy love for an accursed warfare, when thou hast subjected the whole earth to Latian laws, turn thy hands against thyself;
not as yet has a foe been wanting to thee.
But now that the walls are tottering with the dwellings half overthrown throughout the cities of Italy, and, the fortifications falling away, vast stones are lying there, and the houses are occupied by no protector, and but few inhabitants are wandering amid the ancient cities, that Hesperia has remained unsightly with brambles and un­ ploughed for many a year, and that hands are wanting for the fields requiring them-not thou, fierce Pyrrhus, nor yet the Carthaginian1, will prove the cause of ruin so great;
to no sword has it been allowed to penetrate the vitals;
deep-seated are the wounds of the fellow-citi­ zen's right hand.
But if the Fates have decreed no other way2 for Nero to succeed, and at a costly price eternal realms are provided for the Gods, and heaven could only obey its own Thunderer after the wars of the raging Giants3;
then in no degree, 0 Gods above, do we complain;
crimes themselves, and law­ lessness, on these conditions, are approved;
let Pharsalia fill her ruthless plains, and let the shades of the Cartha­ ginians be sated with blood ;
let the hosts meet for the last time at tearful Munda 4.
To these destined wars, Cæsar, let the famine of Perusia1 and the struggles of Mutina2 be added, the fleets, too, which rugged Leucadia overwhelmed 3, and the servile wars beneath the burning Ætna4 ;
still, much does Rome owe to the arms of her citizens, since for thy sake these events have come to pass.
When, thy allotted duties fulfilled, thou shalt late repair to the stars, the palace of heaven, preferred by thee, shall receive thee 5, the skies rejoicing;
whether it please thee to wield the sceptre, or whether to ascend the flaming chariot of Phoebus, and with thy wandering fire to survey the earth, in no way alarmed at the change of the sun 6 ;
by every Divinity will it be yielded unto thee, and to thy free choice will nature leave it what God thou shalt wish to be, where to establish the sovereignty of the world.
But do thou neither choose thy abode in the Arctic circle, nor where the sultry sky of the south behind us declines;
whence with thy star obliquely thou mayst look upon Rome.
If thou shouldst press upon one side of the boundless æther, the sky will be sensible of the burden 1.
Keep thy weight in the mid sphere of the balanced heavens;
may all that part of the æther with sky serene be free-from mist, and may no clouds interpose before Cæsar.
Then, arms laid aside, may the human race consult its own good, and may all nations love one another;
may Peace, sent throughout the world, keep close the iron thresholds2 of the warlike Janus.
But to myself already art thou a Divinity;
and, if I, a bard, receive thee in my breast, I could not wish to invoke the God who moves the mystic shrines of Cirrha 3, and to withdraw Bacchus from Nysa 4.
Suffi­ cient art thou to supply inspiration for Roman song.
My design leads me 5 to recount the causes of events so great, and a boundless task is commenced upon;
what it was that impelled a frantic people to arms — what that drove away Peace from the world.
The envious course of the Fates, and the denial to what is supreme to be of long duration;
the heavy fall, too, beneath a weight too great;
and Rome that could not support herself.
So when, its structure dissolved, the last hour shall have closed so many ages of the universe, all things shall return once more to former chaos;
constellations shall rush on against mingled constellations;
fiery stars shall fall into the deep;
earth shall refuse to extend her shores, and shall cast away the ocean;
Phœbe shall come into collision with her bro­ ther, and, disdaining to guide her two-horsed chariot in its sidelong course, will demand the day for herself;
and the whole mechanism, discordant, will confuse the ties of the universe rent asunder.
Mighty things fall of themselves;
this limit to increase have the Deities assigned to a prosperous state.
Nor yet to the advantage of any other nations does Fortune turn her hate against a people all-powerful by land and by sea.
Thou,
Rome, wast the cause of thy own woes, becoming the common property of three masters 1;
the fatal compact 2, too, for sway never successfully entrusted to a number.
0 ye, dis­ astrously concordant, and blinded by desires too great, why does it please you to unite your strength and to share the world in common ?
While the earth shall support the sea, and the air the earthy and his long courses shall whirl on Titan in his career, and night shall -succeed the day through signs as many, no faith is there in partners in rule, and all power will be impatient of a sharer.
And believe not any nations, nor let the examples of this fatality be sought from afar;
the rising walls of Rome were steeped with a brother's blood4.
Nor was the earth and the ocean then the reward of frenzy so great;
an humble retreat5 brought into collision its lords.
The discordant concord lasted for a short time;
and peace there was, through no inclination of the chieftains.
For Crassus, interposing, was the sole impediment to the des­ tined war.
Just as the narrow Isthmus1 which cleaves and barely divides the two seas, nor yet allows them to meet together;
if the earth were to withdraw, the Ionian would dash itself against the Ægean main;
so, when Crassus, who kept asunder the ruthless arms of the chieftains, by a fate much to be deplored stained Assyrian Carrhæ 2 with Latian blood, the Parthian misfortunes let loose the frenzy of Rome.
More, ye descendants of Arsaces3, was effected by you in that battle than you suppose;
civil warfare you con­ ferred upon the conquered.
The sway is cut asunder by the sword;
and the fortunes of a powerful people, which embrace the sea, the land, the whole earth, brook not two leaders.
For Julia, cut off by the ruthless hand of the Destinies5, bore away to the shades below the ties of allied blood, and the marriage torches 1, with direful omen, portentous of woe.
But if the Fates had allowed thee a longer sojourn in life, thou alone hadst been able to restrain on the one side the husband and on the other the parent, and, the sword dashed down, to join the armed hands, just as the Sabine women, interposing 2, united the sons-in-law with the fathers-in-law.
By thy death is friendship rent asunder, and license granted to the chief­ tains to commence the warfare.
The ambition of rivalry adds its spur.
Thou, Magnus, art afraid lest recent exploits should eclipse former triumphs, and the laurels gained from the pirates should be eclipsed by3 the conquest of the Gauls;
thee, Cæsar, does the continuance of thy labours and thy experience gained by them now elevate, and Fortune4 that cannot brook a second place.
Neither can Cæsar now endure any one his superior, nor Pompey anyone his equal.
Who with the more justice took up arms it is not permitted us to know each one defends himself with a mighty abettor;
the conquering cause was pleasing to the Gods, but the conquered one to CatoNor did they meet on equal terms;
the one, with his years tending downward to old age, and grown tranquil amid a long practice of the arts of peace', had now in tran­ quillity2 forgotten the general;
and, an aspirant for fame, had been wont to confer upon the public many a largess 3;
solely to be wafted on by the popular gales, and to exult in the applause of a theatre his own 4;
not to recruit his strength afresh, and principally to rely upon his former suc­ cesses.
There stood the shadow of a glorious name-:
just as the lofty oak, in a fertile field, which bears the spoils6 of an ancient people and the consecrated gifts of chieftains, now no longer standing fast by its firm roots, is fixed by its own weight;
and sending forth its bared branches into the air, with its trunk, and not its leaves, forms a shade;
and al­ though it threatens to fall at the first eastern blast, and trees so many around it lift themselves with firmly-rooted strength, still it alone is venerated.
But in Cæsar not only was there a name as great, and the fame of the general;
but a valour that knew not how to rest in one place, and a shame only felt at not conquering in war.
Fierce and unrestrained;
ready to lead his troops whither hope and whither vengeance should summon, and never to spare fleshing his sword;
to press on his own advantages, to rely on the favour of the Deity;
bearing down whatever opposed himself as he sought the summit, and rejoicing amid ruin to have made his way.
Just as the lightning forced by the winds through the clouds flashes forth with the echoes of the riven æther and with a crash throughout the universe, and overwhelms the light of day, and terrifies the alarmed nations, dazzling the eyes with its sidelong flame.
It rages against temples its own1;
and, no matter impeding its going forth, both fall­ ing, it sends vast, and returning, vast devastation far and wide, and collects again its scattered fires.
These were the motives secretly existing with the chief­ tains ;
but there were public grounds for the warfare, which have ever overwhelmed mighty nations.
For when, the world subdued, Fortune introduced wealth too great, and the manners gave way before prosperity, and booty and the spoils of the enemy induced luxurious habits;
no mo­ deration was there in gold or in houses;
hunger, too, dis­ dained the tables of former times;
dresses hardly suitable for the matrons to wear, the males seized hold upon 2;
po­ verty fruitful in men 3 was shunned;
and that was fetched from the entire earth by means of which each nation falls.
Then did they join the lengthened boundaries of the fields, and the extended lands once turned up by the hard plough­ share of Camillus 4, and which had submitted to the ancient mattocks of the Curii, lay far and wide beneath the charge of husbandmen unknown to their employers.
This was not the people whom tranquil peace might avail, whom its own liberty might satisfy with arms un­ moved.
Thence arose ready broils, and the contemptible wickedness which poverty could prompt;
and the great honor, and one worthy to be sought with the sword, to have been able to do more than one's own country;
might, too, was the measure of right;
hence laws and decrees of the people1 constrained, and Tribunes confounding their rights with Consuls.
Hence the Fasces 2 snatched up at a price, and the populace itself the vendor of its own applause, and canvassing fatal to the city, bringing round the annual contests on the venal Plain of Mars3;
hence devouring usury, and interest greedy for each moment, and credit shaken, and warfare profitable to the many4.
Now had Cæsar in his course5 passed the icy Alps, and revolved in his mind the vast commotions and the future war.
When he had arrived at the waves of the little Rubi­ con6, the mighty image of his trembling country distinctly appeared to the chieftain in the darkness of the night, bear­ ing marks of extreme sadness on her features, letting loose the white hair from her tower-bearing head, with her long locks dishevelled, standing with her arms all bare, and uttering these words, mingled with sighs :
"
Whither beyond this do you proceed ?
Whither, ye men, do you bear my standards ?
If rightfully you come, if as citizens, thus far you may."
Then did horror smite the limbs of the chieftain, his hair stood on end, and a languor that checked his course withheld his steps on the verge of the bank.
Soon he exclaims, “0 Thunderer, who dost look down1 upon the walls of the mighty city from the Tarpeian rock, and ye Phrygian Penates of the Julian race2, ye se­ cret mysteries, too, of Quirinus borne away3, and Jove of Latium, who dost reside in lofty Alba4, and ye Vestal hearths5, and thou, 0 Rome, equal to a supreme Deity, favour my designs!
With no fatal arms am I pursuing thee;
lo!
here am I, Cæsar, the conqueror by land and by sea, every­ where (if only it is permitted me) thine own soldier even still.
He will it be, he the guilty one, who shall make me thy foe!
"Then did he end the respite from the warfare, and swiftly bore the standards through the swollen stream.
Just as when in the parched plains, of sultry Libya a lion, his enemy perceived at hand, crouches undecided until he collects all his fury;
soon as he has, aroused himself by the lashings of his infuriate tail, and has raised his mane erect, and from his vast throat the loud roar re-echoes;
then, if the light lance of the Moor, hurled, pierces him, or the hunt­ ing spears enter his broad chest, amid the weapons, careless of wounds so great, he rushes on.
From a small spring rises the ruddy Rubicon, and, when fervid summer glows, is impelled with humble waves, and through the lowly vales it creeps along, and, a fixed boundary, separates from the Ausonian husbandmen the Gallic fields.
At that time winter1 gave it strength, and now the showery Cynthia with her blunted horn for the third time' had swollen the waves, and the Alps were thawed by the watery blasts of the eastern breeze.
First of all the charger3 is opposed obliquely to the stream, to bear the brunt of the floods;
then the rest of the throng bursts through the pliant waves of the river, now broken in its course, across the easy ford.
When Cæsar, the stream surmounted, reached the opposite banks, and stood upon the forbidden fields of Hesperia;
“Here," said he, “here do I leave peace, and the violated laws behind;
thee, Fortune, do I follow;
henceforth, far hence be treaties!
The Desti­ nies have we trusted;
War as our umpire we must adopt.
"Thus having said, the active leader in the shades of night hurries on his troops, and swifter than the hurled charge of the Balearic sling1, and the arrow2 shot behind the back of the Parthian;
and threatening he sur­ prises Ariminum3.
Lucifer left behind, the stars fled from the fires of the sun, and now arose the day doomed to behold the first outbreak of the war.
Whether by the will of the Gods, or whether the murky south wind im­ pelled them, clouds obscured the saddened light.
When in the captured Forum the soldier halted, commanded to pitch his standard, the clash of clarions and the clang of trum­ pets sounded the ill-omened signals4 together with the hoarse-sounding horn.
The rest of the people was broken, and, aroused from their beds, the youth snatched down the arms fixed up near the hallowed Penates, which a pro­ longed peace still afforded;
they laid hold of shields decaying with the frames now bare, and darts with blunted points, and swords rough with the cankering of swarthy rust.
When the well-known eagles glittered, and the Roman standards, and Cæsar mounted aloft was beheld in the midst of the ranks, they grew chilled with alarm, icy dread bound fast their limbs, and they revolved these silent complaints within their speechless breasts:
—“ 0 walls ill founded, these, with the Gauls for their neighbours5!
0 walls condemned to a hapless site!
Profound peace and tranquil repose is there throughout all nations, we are the prey and the first encampment for these thus frenzied.
Far better, For­ tune, wouldst thou have afforded an abode in an eastern clime, and under the icy north, and wandering abodes1, rather than to have to protect the threshold of Latium.
We were the first to behold the commotions of the Senones2, the Cimbrian3, too, rushing on, and the hosts of Libya4, and the career of the Teutonic rage.
As oft as Fortune aims a blow at Rome, this is the passage for the warfare.
"Thus with a secret sigh spoke each, not venturing to ex­ press his alarm aloud;
no voice was entrusted to anguish;
but in the same degree in which, when the winter keeps in the birds, the fields are silent, and the mid ocean without a murmur is still, thus profound was the silence.
Light has now dispelled the cold shades of night;
lo!
the Fates sup­ ply to his wavering mind the torches of war and induce­ ments provoking to battle, and rend asunder all the pauses of moderation;
Fortune struggles that the movements of the chieftain shall be justified, and discovers pretexts for his arms.
The threatening Senate, the law violated, expelled from the divided city the differing Tribunes 1 the Gracchi being thrown in their teeth 2.
These now repairing to the stand­ ards of the chieftain moving onward and in their vicinity, the daring Curio, with his venal tongue3, accompanies;
a voice that once was the people's, and that had dared to defend liberty, and to place armed potentates on a level with the lower classes4.
And when he beheld the chieftain revolving his various cares in his breast, he said, “While.
Cæsar, thy party could be aided by my voice, although against the will of the Senate, then did we prolong thy rule 5, so long as I had the liberty to occupy the Rostra 1 and to bring over to thee the wavering Quirites.
But after the laws, coerced by war­ fare, were dumb, we were driven from our paternal homes, and of our own accord we endured exile ;
't is thy victory will make us citizens again.
While, strengthened with no support, the factions are still in doubt, away with delay!
it always injures men prepared to procrastinate.
Equal labours and anxieties are being sought for a greater reward 2.
Gaul has kept thee engaged in war for twice five years a portion of the earth how trifling !
If with a happy result thou hast fought a few battles, Rome for thee will subdue the world4!"
Now neither does the procession of the lengthened triumph5 receive thee returning, nor does the Capitol demand the consecrated laurels.
Cankering envy denies thee everything;
and hardly wilt thou escape with im­ punity having subdued the foe;
it is the determination of the son-in-law to deprive the father-in-law6 of the sway.
Thou canst not share the earth;
alone thou mayst pos­ sess it.
"After he had thus spoken, and had aroused in him, though eager already for the war, much anger still, and had inflamed the chieftain, in the same degree as the Elean courser is urged on by the shouts1, although, the starting place now closed2, he struggles against the door, and head­ long loosens the bolts.
'
Forthwith he summons the armed maniples3 to the standards, and when, the multitudes collect­ ing, he has well calmed their hurrying tumultuousness, with his countenance and his right hand he enjoins silence :
" 0 companions in war!" he exclaims, " who together with me have experienced the thousand hazards of battle, now in the tenth year that you have conquered, has your blood, shed in the regions of the north, deserved this, and wounds and death, and winters passed at the foot of the Alps?
Not otherwise is Rome convulsed by the vast tumultuous preparations for war, than if the Punic Hannibal were de­ scending from the Alps.
With stout recruits the cohorts are being filled;
for the fleet every forest is falling;
and both by sea and by land is Cæsar ordered to be expelled.
What, if my standards had lain prostrate in adverse war­ fare, and if the fierce nations of the Gauls had been rushing close on our backs ?
Now, when Fortune acts with me in prospering circumstances, and the Gods are summoning us to the mastery, we are challenged.
Let him come to the war, the chieftain, enfeebled by prolonged peace4, with his soldiery so hastily levied, his toga-clad partisans, too, and the loquacious Marcellus1, the Catos as well, mere idle names2.
Will, forsooth, men from afar3 and purchased dependants still associate Pompey with the sway for years so many ?
Is he to be guiding the triumphal chariot, his years not yet permitting it4?
Is he never to resign the honors which he has once usurped?
Why need I now complain of the fields placed under restraint5 throughout the whole earth, and how that starvation at his command has become his slave ?
Who does not know how the camp has been intermingled with the trembling Forum ?
When the swords ominously threatening surrounded the terrified judg­ ment seat6 with an unwonted array, and, the soldiery pre­ suming to burst in upon the midst of the legal proceedings, the standards of Pompey closed around the accused Milo.
Now, too, lest an old age spent in privacy should await him in his feebleness, he is preparing for contests accursed, accustomed to civil warfare, and, trained by crimes, to surpass his master Sulla1.
And as the fierce tigers never lay aside their fury, which, in the Hyrcanian forest2, while they haunted the lairs of their dams, the blood deep-drawn of the slain herds has nurtured;
so too, Magnus, does thy thirst survive to thee accustomed to lick the sword of Sulla.
Once received within the lips, no blood allows the polluted jaws to become satiated.
Still, what end will power meet with, thus prolonged ?
What limit is there to crimes ?
At least, dishonorable man, let this Sulla of thine teach thee now to dismount from this supreme sway.
Shall then, after the wandering Cilicians4, and the Pontic battles of the ex­ hausted monarchy with difficulty ended through barbarian poison, Cæsar be granted to Pompey as a last province, because, commanded to lay down my conquering eagles, I did not obey?
If from myself the reward of my labours is torn away, to these, at least, let the rewards of their prolonged service be granted, though not with their general;
under some leader, whoever he is, let these troops enjoy their triumph.
Whither, after the wars, shall pallid old age betake itself?
What settlement is there to be for those who have served their time ?
What lands shall be granted1 for our veterans to plough2 ?
What walls for the invalided ?
Or, Magnus, shall pirates, in preference, become the settlers3?
Victorious already, raise, raise your standards;
the might we must employ, which we have acquired;
to him who wields arms does he surrender everything who refuses what is his due.
The Deities, too, will not forsake us ;
for neither is plunder nor sovereignty sought by my arms;
we are tear­ ing away its tyrants4 from a City ready to be enslaved.
"Thus he speaks;
but the hesitating ranks mutter among themselves words of indecision in whispers far from dis­ tinct ;
duty and their paternal Penates check their feelings although rendered fierce with carnage, and their swelling spirits;
but through ruthless love of the sword and dread of their general, they are brought back.
Then Lælius, who held the rank5 of first centurion, and wore the insignia of the decoration won in service1, the oak that bespoke the reward for saving a citizen2, exclaimed:
“If it is lawful, 0 greatest guardian of the Roman fame, and if it is allowed to utter the accents of truth:
-that a patience so long enduring has withheld thy might, do we complain.
Was it that confidence in us was wanting to thee?
So long as the warm blood imparts motion to these breath­ ing bodies, and so long as stalwart arms have might to hurl the javelin, wilt thou be submitting to the degenerate arts of peace3, and the sovereign sway of the Senate ?
Is it so very dreadful to prove the conqueror in civil war ?
Come, lead us amid the tribes of Scythia, amid the inhospitable shores of Syrtis4, amid the sultry sands of thirsting Libya.
This army, when it left the conquered world behind its back, stilled the swelling waves of Ocean:
with its oars, and subdued the foaming Rhine at its northern mouth6.
To me, in following thy commands, it is as much a matter of course to do, as it is to will.
And no fellow-citizen of mine, Cæsar, is he against whom I shall hear thy trumpet-signal.
By the prospering standards of thy ten campaigns I swear, and by thy triumphs gained over every foe;
if thou shouldst bid me bury my sword in the breast of my brother, in the throat too of my parent, and in the entrails of my wife teeming with her burden, still, though with unwilling right hand, I will do all this;
if to despoil the Gods, and to set fire to the Temples, the flames of thy camp1 shall envelope the Divinity of Juno Moneta;
if to pitch the camp above the waves of Etrurian Tiber2, a bold marker-out of the en­ campment will I enter upon the Hesperian fields.
Whatever walls thou shalt desire to level with the plain, impelled by these arms the battering-ram shall scatter the stones far and wide;
even though that city which thou shouldst order to be utterly razed should be Rome herself.
"To these words the cohorts at once shout assent, and pledge themselves with hands lifted on high, for whatever wars he shall summon them to.
An uproar ascends to the sides as vast, as, when the Thracian Boreas beats against the crags of pine-bearing Ossa3, the trunks bending of the woods bowed down, or returning again upright into the air, the roar of the forests arises.
Cæsar, when he perceives that the war is embraced by the soldiers thus heartily, and that the Fates are favouring, that by no indecision he may impede his fortune, summons forth the cohorts scattered throughout the Gallic fields, and with standards moved from every direction marches upon Rome.
They deserted the tents pitched by the cavity of Lemanus 1, and the camp which soaring aloft above the curving rock of Vogesus2 used to overawe the pugnacious Lingones3 with their painted arms.
Those left the shallows of Isara 4, which running with its own flood through such an extent, falling into a stream of greater fame, bears not its own name down to the ocean waves.
The yellow-haired Ruteni 5 are re­ lieved from the prolonged garrison;
the placid Atax" re­ joices at no longer bearing the Latian keels;
the Varus, too 7.
the limit of Hesperia, her boundaries now extended IS;
where, too, beneath the divine authority of Hercules, the consecrated harbour adjoins the sea9 with its hollowed rocks;
no Corns1 holds sway over it, nor yet the Zephyr;
alone does Circius disturb the shores his own, and with­ holds the ships from the safe harbour of Monæcus.
Where, too, the doubtful coast extends 3, which land and sea claim at alternate periods, when the vast ocean is poured forth upon it, or when with ebbing waves it retreats.
Whether it is that the wind thus rolls 4 on the sea from distant climes, and bearing it on there leaves it;
or whether the waves of wandering Tethys5, influenced by the second of the heavenly bodies 6, flow at the lunar hours;
or whether the flaming Titan, that he may quaff the refreshing waves, uplifts the ocean, and raises the billows to the stars-do you enquire, whom the economy of the universe engages;
but to me, thou Cause, whatever thou art, that dost govern movements thus regular, as the Gods of heaven have willed it so, for ever lie concealed!
Then does he, who occupies the fields of Nemetis7 and the banks of the Aturus 8, where on the curving shore, flowing by Tarbela 9, it encloses the sea gently flowing in, move his standards, and the Santonian exults 1, the enemy removed.;
the Biturigian 2, too, and the active Suessones3 with their long arms;
the Leucan 4 and the Rheman5, most adroit in extending the arm with the poised javelin;
the Sequanian race most adroit with the reins guided in the circle;
the Belgian, too 6, the skilful guide of the scythed chariot 7;
the Arverni, likewise 1, who have presumed to pretend them­ selves 2 of Latian brotherhood, descended from the race of the people of Ilium;
the Nervian, also 3, too fatally re­ bellious 4, and defiled by the broken treaty with the slaugh­ tered Cotta;
the Vangiones, too5, who imitate thee, Sarma­ tian, with the loosely-flowing trowsers 6;
the fierce Batavians, too 1, whom the harsh-sounding trumpets of crooked brass 2 inflame to war;
where Cinga flows around3 with its tide;
where the Rhone bears to the sea the Arar 4, swept along with its impetuous waves;
where the race dwells upon the heights on the mountain summits, the Gebennce precipi­ tous 3 with their snow-white crags.
[The Pictones, left at liberty 6, cultivate their fields 7;
and no more does the camp pitched around keep in check the fickle Turones 8.
The Andian disdaining, Meduana 9, to pine amid thy fogs, is now refreshed by the placid stream of Liger 1;
from the squadrons of Cæsar renowned Genabos2 is set free.]
Thou, too, Trevirian3, overjoyed that the course of warfare is turned back;
and thou, Ligurian 4, now shorn, in former times with thy locks hanging adown thy graceful neck, preferred to the whole of long-haired Gaul5;
those, too, by whom the relentless Teutates6 is appeased by direful bloodshed, and Hesus, dreadful7 with his merciless altars;
and the shrine of Taranis8, not more humane than that of Scythian Diana9.
You, too, ye Bards 10, who, as poets, hand down in your praises to remote ages spirits valiant, and cut off in war, freed from alarm, did then pour forth full many a strain;
and you, Druids 1, after arms were laid aside, sought once again your barbarous ceremonials and the ruth­ less usages of your sacred rites.
To you alone has it been granted to know the Gods and the Divinities of heaven, or alone to know that they do not exist.
In remote forests do you inhabit the deep glades.
On your authority 3 the shades seek not the silent abodes of Erebus, and the pallid realms of Pluto in the depths below;
the same spirit controls other limbs in another world 5 ;
death is the mid space in a pro­ longed existence, if you sing what is ascertained as truth.
Assuredly the nations whom the Northern Bear looks down upon are happy in their error, whom this, the very greatest of terrors, does not move, the fear of death.
Thence have the people spirits ever ready to rush to arms, and souls that welcome death;
and they deem it cowardice to be sparing of a life destined to return.
You, too, stationed to prevent the Cauci 6, with their curling locks, from warfare, repair to Rome, and desert the savage banks of the Rhine, and the world now laid open to the nations.
Cæsar, when his immense resources, with their collected strength, had created confidence for daring still greater things, spread throughout all Italy, and filled the neigh­ bouring fortified towns 1.
Idle rumours, too, were added to well-founded fears, and burst upon the feelings of the public, and presented to them the destined slaughter, and, a swift forerunner of the hastening warfare, let loose tongues innumerable to false alarms.
Some there are who, where Mevania displays itself 2 in the plains that rear the bulls, aver that the audacious squadrons are pushing onward to the combat, and that, where Nar flows 3 on to the stream of Tiber, the barbarian troops of the ruthless Cæsar are spread­ ing far and wide;
that he himself, leading all his eagles and his collected standards, is advancing with no single column, and with a camp densely thronged.
And not such as they remember him do they now behold him;
both more terrible and relentless does he seem to their imaginations, and more inhuman than the conquered foe4.
That after him the nations lying between the Rhine and the Alps, torn from the Arctic regions and from their paternal homes, are following close, and that the City has been ordered, a Roman looking on, to be sacked by barbarous tribes.
Thus, by his fears, does each one give strength to rumour;
and no one the author of their woes, what they have invented they dread.
And not alone is the lower class alarmed, smitten by a groundless terror;
but the Senate house, and the Fathers themselves rush forth from their seats, and the Senate taking to flight gives its hateful de­ crees 1 for the warfare into the charge of the Consuls.
Then uncertain what to seek as safe, and what to leave as worthy to be feared, whither the anxiety for flight directs each one, it urges the populace headlong, and the throng, connected in one long line, bursts forth.
You would suppose either that accursed torches had set fire to the abodes, or that now, the ruins shaking, the nodding houses were tottering to their fall;
thus does the panic-stricken multitude at random rush throughout the City with precipitate steps, as though there had been but one hope in their ruined fortunes, to desert their paternal walls.
Just as, when the stormy south wind has repulsed from the Libyan Syrtes the boundless ocean, and the broken mass of the sail-bearing mast has sent forth its crash, and the pilot, the ship deserted, leaps into the waves, the seaman, too, and thus, the structure of the vessel not yet torn asunder, each one makes a shipwreck for himself;
so the City forsaken, do they fly unto the warfare.
The parent, now weakened with old age, was able to call no one back 2 ;
nor yet the wife her husband with her tears;
nor did the household Lares detain them, while they were breathing prayers for their safety thus doubtful;
nor did any one pause at the threshold, and then, filled with perhaps his last glimpse of the beloved City, take his departure;
not to be called back, the crowd rushes on.0 Deities, ready to grant supreme prosperity, and loth to preserve the same!
The cowardly throngs left the City a prey on Cæsar's approach, filled with the people and with conquered nations, and able to hold the human race, if the multitude were collected together.
When, in foreign re­ gions, the Roman soldier, pressed by the foe, is hemmed in, he escapes the dangers of the night by a simple trench;
and the rampart suddenly formed with the protection of some clods torn up affords secure slumbers within the tents.
Thou Rome, on the name only of war being heard art being deserted;
a single night has not been trusted to thy walls.
Still, pardon must be granted, yes, must be granted for alarms thus great.
Pompey flying, they were in dread 1.
Besides, that even no hope in the future might cheer their failing spirits, there was added the disclosed assurance of a still worse future, and the threatening Gods of heaven filled with prodigies the earth, the seas, the skies.
The gloomy nights beheld stars unknown, and the sky burn­ ing with flames, and torches flying obliquely through the expanse along the heavens, and the train of a fear-inspiring meteor, and a comet threatening tyranny to the earth 2.
Incessant lightnings flashed in the deceptive clear sky, and the fire described various forms in the dense atmosphere ;
now a javelin, with a prolonged flame, and now a torch, with a scattered light, flashed in the heavens.
Lightning in silence without any clouds, and bringing its fires from the Arctic regions 3, smote the Capital of Latium 4;
the lesser stars, too, that were wont to speed onwards in the still hours of the night, came in the middle of the day;
and, her horns closed, when Phœbe was now reflecting her brother on her whole orb, struck by the sudden shadow of the earth she turned pale.
Titan himself, when he was raising his head in mid Olympus, concealed his glowing chariot in dense darkness, and enwrapped the earth in shade, and forced the nations to despair of day;
just as, the Sun retreating by the east, Mycenæ of Thyestes brought on the night 1.
Grim Mulciber opened the mouths of Sicilian Etna2;
nor did it raise its flames to the heavens, but with its crest bending low the flame fell downwards on the Hesperian side.
The black Charybdis stirred up from her depths sea of the colour of blood;
the.
savage dogs barked in dismal tones.
The fire was torn from the Vestal altars;
and the flame that showed that the Latin rites 3 were completed was divided into two parts, and rose with a twofold point, re­ sembling the funeral piles of Thebes 4.
Then did the Earth withdraw from her axis, and, their ridges quaking, the Alps shook off their ancient snows.
With billows more mighty Tethys did overwhelm Hesperian Calpe 1 and the heights of Atlas 2.
We have heard how that the native Deities 3 wept, and how with sweat the Lares attested the woes of the City, how, too, that the presented gifts fell down in their Temples, and birds of ill omen4 polluted the day;
and how that the wild beasts, emboldened, the woods at nightfall deserted, made their lairs in the midst of Rome.
Then were the tongues of cattle adapted 3 to human accents;
monstrous births, too, there were, of human beings, both as to the num­ ber and the formation of the limbs, and her own infant struck the mother with horror;
the fatal lines too, of the Pro- phetess of Cumæ were repeated among the populace.
Then did those, whom with their hacked arms the savage Bellona inspires1, sing of the Gods enraged;
and tossing their blood- stained hair, the Galli howled forth2sad accents to the throng.
Urns filled with bones laid at rest sent forth groans.
Then arose the crash of arms, and loud voices were heard amid the remote parts of the groves, and ghosts came nigh to men3.
Those, too, who till the fields adjacent to the extre­ mities of the walls, fled in all directions ;
the mighty Erinnys was encompassing the City about, shaking her pitch-tree torch down-turned with flaming top, and her hissing locks;
such as when the Fury impelled the Theban Agave4, or whirled in air the weapons of the savage Lycurgus5;
or such as, when, by the command of the unjust Juno, Pluto now visited, Alcides shuddered at Megæra1.
Trumpets re­ sounded, and black night, amid the silent shades, sent forth an uproar as loud as that with which the cohorts are min­ gled in combat.
The shade of Sulla, too, seeming to arise in the middle of the Plain of Mars2, uttered ill-boding prophe­ cies ;
and the husbandmen fled from Marius raising his head at the cold waves of Anio3, his sepulchre burst asunder.
By reason of these things it seemed good that, according to the ancient usage, the Etrurian prophets 4 should be summoned.
Of whom, Aruns, the one most stricken in years, inhabited the walls of deserted Luca1, well-skilled in the movements of the lightnings, and the throbbing veins of the entrails, and the warnings of the wing2 hover­ ing in the air.
In the first place he orders the monsters, which revolting nature has produced from no seed, to be seized, and then bids them burn the accursed progeny of the barren womb in ill-omened flames3.
Then next he orders the whole City to be perambulated by the trembling citi­ zens, and the priests, who purify the walls at the festive lus­ trum, to whom is granted the power to perform the rite, to go round about the lengthened spaces without the walls4, at the extreme boundaries.
The inferior throng follows, tightly girt in the Gabinian fashion and the filleted priestess leads the Vestal -choir, to whom alone it is permitted to behold the Trojan Minerva6.
Next, those who have charge of the decrees of the Gods and the mystic prophecies, and who reconduct Cybele, when bathed, from the little Almo1:
the Augur, too, skilled in observing the birds on the left hand;
and the Septemvir2, joyous at the festivals, and the fellowship of the Titii3,-the Salian, likewise4, carrying the ancilia1 on his exulting neck;
and the Flamen2, who wears the tuft3 upon his noble head.
And while in prolonged circuit they go round about the emptied City, Aruns collects the dispersed objects struck by flames of lightning, and with a lamenting murmur buries them in the earth, and bestows a name upon the conse­ crated spots4.
Then does he urge onward to the altar a male, with selected neck.
Now had he begun to pour the wine, and to place on it the salted corn1, with knife pointed downwards;
and long was the victim impatient of the rites2 not grateful to him;
when the aproned attendants pressed upon the threatening horns, sinking on his knees he pre­ sented his subdued neck.
And no blood as usual spurted forth;
but from the gaping wound there was black venom poured forth instead of ruddy gore.
Astounded at the ill- omened rites Aruns turned pale, and sought the wrath of the Gods of heaven in the torn-out entrails.
The very colour alarmed the prophet;
for a pervading lividness streaked with spots of blood the pallid vitals, tinted with foul spots and gorged with congealed blood.
He perceives the liver reeking with corruption, and beholds the veins threatening on the enemy's side3.
The fibres of the pant­ ing lungs lie concealed, and a narrow line separates the vital parts.
The heart lies still;
and through gaping clefts the vitals emit corrupt matter;
the cauls, too, disclose their retreats;
and, shocking sign!
that which has appeared with impunity in no entrails, lo !
he sees growing upon the head of the entrails the mass of another head4—a part hangs weak and flabby, a part throbs and with a rapid pulsation incessantly moves the veins.
When, by these means, he understood the fated allotment of vast woes, he exclaimed, “Hardly is it righteous, Gods of heaven, for me to disclose to the people what you warn me of!
nor indeed, supreme Jupiter, have I propitiously offered unto thee5 this sacrifice;
and into the breast of the slaughtered bull have the infernal Deities entered!
Things not to be uttered do we dread;
but things still greater than our apprehensions will come to pass.
May the Gods grant a prosperous result to what has been seen, and may there be no truth in the entrails;
but rather may Tages, the foun­ der of the art, have fondly invented all these things!"
Thus did the Etrurian, obscuring the omens and conceal­ in- them in much perplexing doubt, utter his prophecies.
But Figulus, to whom it was a care to know the Gods and the secrets of the heavens, whom not Egyptian Mem­ phis3 could equal in the science of the stars and in the principles which regulate the heavenly bodies, exclaimed :
­ "
Either this world wanders without any laws throughout all ages, and the Constellations run to and fro with uncertain movements;
or else, if the Fates hold sway, a speedy de­ struction is preparing for the City and the human race.
Will the earth yawn, and cities be swallowed up ?
Or will the glowing atmosphere deprive us of all moderate temperature?
Will the faithless earth refuse her crops of corn ?
Will all the water be mingled with poison infused therein ?
What kind of ruin, 0 Gods of heaven, with what plagues do you furnish your vengeance ?
At the same instant the closing days of many have met.
If the cold star of Saturn, with its evil influence in the lofty heaven, had lighted up its dusky fires, Aquarius would have poured forth showers worthy of Deucalion 1, and the whole earth would have been concealed in the ocean spread over it.
If, Phœbus, thou wast now urging the fierce Nemean lion2 with thy rays, flames would be making their way over the whole world, and, set on fire by thy chariot, the sky would be in a blaze.
Those fires pause:
thou, Gradivus, who dost inflame the threatening Scorpion with his burning tail, and dost scorch his claws, why dost thou make preparations thus mighty?
For with his remote setting propitious Jupiter3 is going down, and the healthful star of Venus is dim, and the Cyllenian Deity4, rapid in his movements, is retarded, and Mars occupies the heavens alone.
“Why have the Constellations forsaken their courses, and why in obscurity are they borne along throughout the uni­ verse ?
Why thus intensely shines the side of the sword-girt Orion5 ?
The frenzy of arms is threatening;
and the might of the sword shall confound all right by force;
and for many a year shall this madness prevail
And what avails it to ask .an end from the Gods of heaven ?
That peace comes 'witi a tyrant alone.
Prolong,
Rome, the continuous series of thy woes;
protract for a length of time thy calamities, only now free during civil war.
"These presages greatly alarm the trembling multitude, but greater ones confound them.
For just as on the heights of Pindus1 the Edonian female2, filled with the Ogygian Lyæus3, hurries along, so likewise is a matron4, borne along through the astounded City, disclosing by these words how Phcebus is exciting her breast:
“Whither, O Pæan5, am I being home?
In what land art thou placing me, hurried along amid the skies ?
I see Pangæum6, white with its snowy ridges, and extended Philippi beneath the crags of Hæmus7.
What frenzy this is, 0 Phcebus, tell me;
why do Roman armies mingle their weapons and their bands ?
Without an enemy1 is there war ?
Torn away, whither am I being borne?
Thou art conducting me to the distant east, where the sea is changed by the stream of the Nile of Lagus2.
Him who is lying a hideous trunk a on the river's sand, do I recognize.
Over the seas am I borne to the shifting Syrtes4 and the parched Libya, whither the direful Erinnys has transferred the ranks of Emathia5.
Now above the heights of the cloud-capt Alps and the aërial Pyrenees6 am I torn away.
To the abodes of my native City I return, and in the midst of the Senate impious warfare7 is being waged.
Factions again8 arise, and once more throughout all the earth do I proceed.
Permit me to behold fresh shores of the sea9, and fresh lands;
now, Phœbus, have I beheld Philippi!
"Thus she said;
and exhausted by her wearied frenzy she laid her down.

now was the wrath of the Deities displayed, and the universe gave manifest signs of war;
foreknowing nature by her monster-bearing confusion overthrew the laws and the compacts of things, and proclaimed the fatality.
Why, ruler of Olympus, has it seemed good to thee to add this care to anxious mortals, that by means of direful omens they should know of misfortunes about to come ?
Whether it is that, when first the parent of the world, the flame re ceding, set apart the shapeless realms and unformed matter, he established causes to endless time, by which he rules all things, binding himself as well by a law, and, with the im­ movable boundaries of fate, allotted the world to endure its « destined ages ;
or whether it is that nothing is preordained, but Chance wanders in uncertainty, and brings and brings round again events, and accident rules the affairs of mortals:
may that be instantaneous, whatever thou dost intend;
may the mind of man be blind to his future fate;
to him who dreads may it be allowed to hope.
Therefore when they perceived at the price of how vast calamity to the world the truthfulness of the Gods of heaven was about to be realized, there was a general mourning1 in token of woe throughout the City;
clad in the plebeian garb 2 all honors lay concealed;
the purple accompanied no fasces.
Then did they withhold expression of their griefs, and great anguish without a voice pervaded all.
Thus at the moment of death the astounded house is silent while the body is lying not yet called upon by name 3, nor as yet does the mother with her dishevelled locks prompt the arms of the female domestics to the cruel beatings on their breasts ;
but when, life fled, she presses the stiffened limbs and the lifeless features, and the eyes swimming in death, no longer is it anguish, but now it is dread;
distractedly she throws herself down, and is astounded at her woes.
The matron has laid aside her former habit, and sorrowing throngs occupy the shrines.
These sprinkle the Gods with tears;
these dash their breasts against the hard ground, and, awe-stricken, throw their torn-out hair upon the sacred threshold, and with repeated bowlings strike upon the ears accustomed to be addressed in prayer.
And not all lay in the Temple of the Supreme Thunderer;
they made division of the Deities, and at no altar was there wanting a parent to create discontent1;
one of whom, tearing her bedewed cheeks, and blackened with blows, upon her livid arms, exclaimed, " Now, 0 wretched matrons, beat your breasts, now tear your locks, nor defer this grief and preserve it for our crowning woes.
Now have you the power to weep, while the fortune of the chieftains is undecided;
when one shall have proved the conqueror, you must rejoice."
With these incentives did grief en­ courage itself.
The men likewise, repairing to the hostile camps, are pour­ ing forth well-grounded complaints against the relentless Divinities. "
Oh luckless lot, that we were not born for the Punic days of Cannæ2 and of Trebia 3, a youthful race!
Gods of heaven, we do not ask for peace;
inspire with anger foreign nations;
at once arouse the enraged cities;
let the world conspire in arms;
let the Median ranks descend from Achæmenian4 Susa 5;
let the Scythian IsterG not confine the Massagetan1;
let the Albis 2 pour forth the yellow- haired Suevi 3 from the extreme north and the unsubdued sources of the Rhine 4;
make us the foes of all nations ;
but avert civil warfare.
On the one side let the Dacian press-upon us6, the Getan on the other 6 ;
let the one meet the Iberians 7, the other turn his standards against the eastern quivers.
Let no hand, Rome, of thine8, enjoy leisure.
Or if, ye Gods of heaven, it is your pleasure to blot out the Hesperian name, gathered into fires let the entire æther1 descend in lightnings upon the earth.
En­ raged Parent, at the same instant smite both partisans and leaders, while not as yet they have deserved it.
Do they with an extent so great of unheard of crimes, seek to know which of the two is to rule the City ?
Hardly would it have been worth the while to levy civil war, that neither might.
"Such complaints did piety, doomed to be bootless, pour forth;
but a care their own afflicted wretched parents, and they detested the long-lived destiny of a sorrowing old age, and years reserved for civil warfare a second time.
And one, seeking precedents for their great alarm, exclaimed, " Not other commotions did the Fates intend at the time when,victorious afterthe Teutonic2 and the Libyan triumphs3, the exiled Marius concealed his head amid the slimy sedge 4.
The pools of the plashy soil and the fenny marshes con­ cealed, Fortune, thy deposit;
next did the chains of iron:
eat into the aged man, and prolonged squalor in prison.
A Consul, and fated to die successful 1 in the subdued City, beforehand did he pay the penalty of his crimes.
Death herself fled full oft from the hero, and in vain was power granted to his enemy2 over the hated blood;
who, at the very stroke of death stood riveted and from his faltering hand let fall the sword.
He had beheld an intense light in the darkened cell, and the dread Goddesses of crime, and the Marius of a future day, and in alarm he had heard, ' It is not right for thee to touch this neck;
to the laws of fate does he owe many deaths before his own;
lay aside thy vain fury.
If it is your wish to avenge the destruction of your extinct race, Cimbrians, do you preserve this aged man!'
Not by the favour of the Deity, but by the mighty anger of the Gods of heaven was this cruel man pro­ tected, and he sufficed for Fate when desiring to ruin Rome."
He, too, borne over the stormy main 3 to a hostile land, and driven among the deserted cottages 4, lay amid the spoiled realms of the conquered Jugurtha 5, and trod upon the Punic ashes 6.
Carthage and Marius exchanged consolation for their fates, and equally prostrate, patiently submitted to the Gods.
There did he collect together the resentfulness of Libya 1.
When first, his fortune returning, he set free troops of slaves 2, the iron wrought up 3 into swords, the slaves' dungeons 4 sent forth the ruthless bands.
To no one were entrusted the ensigns of their leader to be carried, except to him who had now gained expe­ rience in wickedness, and had brought crime into the camp.
Oh ye Fates!
what a day, what a day was that, on which the victorious Marius seized the walls !
and with strides how vast did cruel Death hurry on !
With the commonalty the nobles fall;
and far and wide stalks the sword, and the weapon is withdrawn from the breast of none.
Gore stands in the temples, and red with plenteous slaughter the slippery stones are wet.
To no one was his age a protection.
There was no shame at having hurried on the closing day of the aged man in his declining years;
nor in the very threshold of life at cutting short the rising destiny of the wretched infant.
By what criminality could little chil­ then be deserving of slaughter?
But now enough is it to be able to die.
The very impetuosity of frenzy hurries them on, and it seems like sluggishness to be in search of the guilty.
To swell the number a large portion falls;
and the blood-stained victor seizes the head cut off from an unknown neck, as he is ashamed to go with an empty hand.
The only hope of safety is to imprint trembling kisses 1 on the polluted right hand.
Although a thousand swords attended the unheard-of signals for death, 0 de­ generate people, hardly would it be becoming for men thus to earn lengthened ages of existence, much less the short-lived disgrace of surviving, and life until Sulla returns 2."
Who has the leisure to bewail the deaths of the multitude ?
Hardly thee, Bæbius 3, rent asunder by thine entrails, and how that the countless hands of the dismembering throng tore thy limbs to pieces;
or thee, Antonius, foreteller of woes, whose features, hanging by the torn white hair 4, dripping with blood, the soldier carrying placed upon the festive table.
Fimbia mangled1 the beheaded Crassi 2.
The relentless prison was steeped with Tribunitial gore.
Thee also, Scævola 3, neglected by the unscrupulous right hand, before the very shrine of the Goddess and her ever-burning hearths they slew;
but exhausted old age poured forth little blood from thy throat, and spared the flames.
These things his seventh Consular year followed 4, the fasces regained.
That was the closing period of the life of Marius, who had endured all things which evil fortune is able to effect, and who had enjoyed all things which a better fortune can bring, and had experienced what fortune can destine for man."
Now at Sacriportus 1 how many dead bodies fell pros­ trate, or how many slaughtered troops did the Collinian Gate2 endure, at the time when the sovereignty of the world and the sway of power, transferred, had almost changed its site 3, and the Samnite hoped for Roman wounds exceeding the Caudine Forks 4 !
Sulla, too, added as an avenger to the boundless slaughter.
He shed the little blood that was remaining to the City, and while he amputated the limbs now too corrupt, the healing art ex­ ceeded its limits, and the hand followed too far where the malady led it.
The guilty perished;
but when now the guilty alone could possibly be surviving.
Then was scope given to hatred, and, let loose from the rein of the laws, anger rushed on.
Not for one crime were all sacrificed, but each one framed a criminality of his own.
Once for all had the victor given his commands.
Through the entrails of his master 5 did the servant plunge the accursed sword;
sons were steeped in a father's blood.
The contention was, to whom the severed head of the parent belonged;
brothers fell as a reward to brothers.
The tombs were filled by flight, and living bodies were intermingled with the buried, and the dens of wild beasts received the throng.
This one broke his neck and his compressed throat with the halter;
another hurling himself, with weight falling headlong, dashed against the hard ground, burst asunder;
and from the blood-stained victor they snatched away their own slaughter;
this one himself heaped up the oaken fabric of his own funeral pile, and, all his blood not yet poured forth, leaped down into the flames, and, while yet he might, took possession of the fires.
The heads of chieftains are carried on javelins throughout the trembling City, and heaped up in the midst of the Forum.
Whatever crime there is any­ where existing is then known.
Not Thrace beheld so many hanging in the stables1 of the Bistonian tyrant, nor Libya upon the posts of Antæus ;
nor did lamenting Greece weep for torn limbs so many in the halls of Pisa.
When now they had mouldered away in corruption, and confused, in length of time lost their marks, the right hand of the wretched parents collected them, and, recognized, stealthily removed them with timid theft.
I remember, too, that I myself, anxious to place the disfigured features of my slain brother upon the pile and the forbidden flames, searched about among all the carcases of this Sullanian peace, and amid all the trunks sought for one with which the head lopped from the neck would correspond."
Why shall I make mention of the shades of Catulus ap­ peased 1 ?
When Marius the victim 2 made, a sad sacrifice to perhaps an unwilling shade, an unutterable atonement to an insatiate tomb 3 ;
when we beheld the mangled limbs, and the wounds equal in number with the members, and no one given fatal to life, although upon a body mangled all over, and the ruthless usage of an accursed cruelty to forego the death of him who was thus perishing.
Hands torn off fell down, and the tongue cut out still quivered, and with noiseless movement beat the vacant air.
This one cuts off the ears, another the nostrils of the aquiline nose;
that one gouges out the eye-balls from their hollow sockets, and, his mangled limbs viewed by himself, put out his eyes the last.
Hardly will there be any believing that one person could have endured the punishments thus numerous of a crime so dreadful.
Thus under the mass of ruins limbs are broken beneath the vast weight;
nor more disfigured do the headless carcases come to shore which have pe­ rished in the midst of the ocean."
Why has it pleased you to lose your pains, and to dis­ figure the features of Marius, as though an ignoble person ?
That this criminality and slaughter on being made known might please Sulla, he ought to have been able to be recog­ nized.
Prænestine Fortune beheld4 all her citizens cut off together by the sword-a people perishing at a moment by a single death.
Then fell the flower of Italy, nowthe sole youth of Latium, and stained the sheepfolds of wretched Rome1.
So many youths at the same instant to fall by a hostile death, full oft has famine, the rage too of the ocean, and sud­ den earthquake caused, or pestilence of climate and locality, or slaughter in warfare, vengeance it never was that did so.
Hardly, amid the masses of the dense multitude, and the pallid throngs, could the victors, death inflicted, move their hands.
Hardly, the slaughter completed, do they fall, and with neck still dubious 2 they totter;
but the vast carnage bears them down, and the carcases perform the part of slaughter;
the trunks falling heavily smother the living 3.
Unconcerned he sat above, a careless spectator of wicked­ ness so great;
he repented not that he had ordered so many thousands of the hapless multitude to die."
The Etrurian stream received 4 all the Sullanian corpses heaped together.
Into the river the first ones foil, upon the bodies the last.
Ships sailing with the tide stuck fast, and, choked up in its waters by the bloody carnage, the mouth of the river flowed out into the sea.
The following waves stood still at the mass, until the stream of deep blood made a passage for itself, and, pouring forth over all the plain and rushing with headlong stream down to the floods of Tiber, aided the impeded waters;
and now no longer does its bed nor yet its banks, contain the river, and it throws back the corpses on the plain.
At length having struggled with difficulty down to the Etrurian waves, with the flowing blood it divided the azure sea.
For this did Bulla merit to be styled the saviour of the state;
for this to be called the Fortunate 1 ;
for this to raise for him­ self a tomb in the middle of the Plain of Mars ?"
These wrongs await us to be again endured;
in this order of warfare will they proceed;
this conclusion will await the civil strife.
Although still greater calamities do our alarms anticipate, and they rush to battle with much greater detriment to the human race.
Rome recovered was the greatest reward of war to the exiled Marii, nor more did victory afford to Bulla than utterly to destroy the hated fac­ tion.
These, Fortune 2, on other grounds thou dost invite, and, raised to power already, they meet in combat.
Neither would be commencing civil war, if content with that with which Bulla was."
Thus did old age lament, sorrowing and mindful of the past, and fearful of the future.
But terror did not strike the breast of the noble Brutus 3, nor was he a portion of the trembling populace weeping in alarm so great at the commotion;
but in the drowsy night, when the Parrhasian Helice was turning her cha­ riot obliquely, he knocked at the not extensive halls of his kinsman Cato2.
He found him with sleepless anxiety re­ flecting on the public affairs, the fates of men, and the fortunes of the City, both-fearful for all and regardless for himself;
and in these words he began to address him :
—"
Do thou, now the sole refuge for virtue expelled and long since banished from all lands, whom by no tempestuous shock Fortune shall tear away from thee, direct me waver­ ing in mind, do thou confirm me in doubt with assured strength ;
for let others follow Magnus or the arms of Caesar, Cato shall be the sole leader of Brutus.
Dost thou adhere to peace, keeping thy footsteps unshaken while the world is in doubt ?
Or has it been thy pleasure, mingling in slaughter with the leaders of crime and of the maddened populace, to forgive the civic strife ?
Each one do his own reasons hurry away to the accursed combat:
these a pol­ luted house 3, and laws to be dreaded in peace;
these hunger to be driven away by means of the sword, and plighted faith to be lost sight of4 amid the ruins of the world.
Fury has impelled no one to arms;
overcome by a vast reward, they are repairing to the camps:
for its own sake is the warfare pleasing to thee alone ?
What has it availed thee so many years to have remained untouched by the man- ners of a corrupt age ?
This sole reward of thy long-prac­ tised virtues shalt thou receive;
others the wars shall find thyself they shall make, guilty.
0
Gods of heaven, let not so much be allowed to the fatal arms as even to have moved these hands;
and let no javelins hurled by thy arms be borne in the dense cloud of weapons;
nor let valour so great be thrown away on chanced
All the fortune of the war will rest itself on thee.
Who shall be unwilling, although falling by the wound from another, to die by this sword, and for the crime to be thine own ?
Better alone without arms wilt thou live in tranquil inactivity, just as the stars of heaven ever unmoved roll onward in their course.
The air nearer to the earth is inflamed with the lightnings, and the lowermost regions of earth receive the winds and the flashing streaks of flame;
Olympus, by the will of the Gods, stands above the clouds.
The least of things does discord disturb ;
the highest enjoy peace."
How joyously will the ears of Cæsar learn that a citizen so great has come forth to battle !
For that the rival camp of the chieftain Magnus has been preferred to his own he will never grieve.
Too much does he please himself2, if civil war is pleasing to Cato.
A large portion of the Senate and a Consul, about to wage war under a general a private person a, and other nobles as well, cause me anguish;
to whom add Cato under the yoke of Pompey, then through­ out the whole world Cæsar alone will be free 4.
But if for the laws of thy country it pleases thee to take up arms, and to defend liberty, already thou dost have Brutus the enemy neither of Pompey nor of Cæsar, but after the war, of the conqueror.
"Thus he speaks.
But Cato utters to him from his secret breast these hallowed words :
—"
Brutus, I confess that civil warfare is wickedness in the extreme;
but whither the fates lead, virtue with clear conscience shall follow.
It shall be the crime of the Gods of heaven to have made even me guilty.
Who is able to look upon the stars and the world falling to ruin, void of fear himself?
Who, when the lofty sky is rushing downwards, the earth is quaking, the weight of the confused universe mingling together, can keep his hands folded in inactivity?
Shall stranger nations follow the frenzy of Hesperia and the Roman wars, and Kings be led over the seas beneath other climes, and shall I alone live in inactivity?
Far hence avert, 0 Gods of heaven, the frantic notion that Rome may fall, in its ruin to affect the Dahans1 and the Getans, While I am free from care.
As grief itself bids the parent bereaved by the death of his sons, to head the long fu­ nereal procession to the tomb;
it gives him satisfaction to have thrust his hands amidst the blackening flames, and himself to have held the swarthy torches2 in the heaped-up structure of the pile;
I will not be torn away, before, Rome, I shall have embraced thee lifeless, and Liberty, thy name, and shall have followed thy unsubstantial shade.
So let it be;
let the unappeased Gods receive a full expiatory sacri­ fice, of no blood let us defraud the warfare.
And would that it were possible for the Gods of heaven and of Erebus to ex­ pose this head of mine condemned to every punishment!"
The hostile troops bore down the devoted Decius3;
me let two armies assail, me let the barbarian multitude from the Rhine aim at with their darts;
may I, accessible, in the midst, receive from all the lances the wounds of the entire warfare.
May this blood redeem the people;
by my fate may it be atoned for, whatever the Roman manners have deserved to pay the penalty for Why should the people ready for the yoke-why should those desirous to endure a harsh sway, perish?
Myself alone attack with the sword- myself who in vain maintain our laws and empty rights;
this throat, this, will provide peace, and an end of their hard­ ships for the nations of Hesperia;
after I am gone there is no need of war for him who wishes to reign.
Why do we not then follow the standards of the state and Pompey as our leader ?
And yet, if Fortune shall favour, it has been well ascertained that he as well promises himself the sway over the whole world.
Let him conquer therefore, myself his soldier, that he may not suppose that for himself he has conquered."
Thus he spoke, and he applied sharp incentives to his indignation and aroused the warm blood of the youth to too great fondness for civil war.
In the meantime, Phoebus dispelling the chilly shades of night, the door, being knocked at, sent forth a sound;
and the hallowed Marcia' entered in grief, having left the tomb of Hortensius1;
once, a virgin, joined in wedlock to a better .
husband;
afterwards when, the price and the reward of wed­ lock, her third progeny was bom, she in her pregnancy was given to fill another home with her offspring, destined to unite two houses by a mother's blood.
But after she had enclosed in the urn the last ashes, hurrying with tearful countenance, tearing her dishevelled hair, and beating her breast with repeated blows, and bearing the ashes of the tomb, not destined to please her husband in other guise, thus in sadness did she speak :
­ "
While I had in me the strengthening blood, while strength to endure a mother's pains, Cato, I performed thy com­ mands, and pregnant, two husbands did I receiver My vitals wearied and exhausted by child-bearing I now return, to no other husband to be handed over.
Grant the unenjoyed ties of our former union;
grant only the empty name of wedlock;
let it be allowed to inscribe on my tomb, 'Marcia, the wife of Cato;
' nor let it be enquired as doubtful in remote posterity whether I abandoned my first marriage torch, repudiated or only transferred.
Thou dost not receive me as a partner in joyous circumstances:
amid thy cares and to share thy griefs, do I come.
Allow me to attend the camp.
Why shall I be left in the safety of peace, and Cornelia be near to the civic strife?
"These words influenced the hero, and though the times were unsuited for wedlock, Fate now summoning him to the war, still a solitary union pleased him, and nuptials devoid of empty pomp, and the admission of the Gods alone3 as witnesses of the solemnities.
No festive garlands hang from the wreath-bound threshold, and no white fillet4 runs along the two doorposts, nor are there the usual torches1, nor does the couch stand on high with its ivory steps3, or variegate its coverings with embroidered gold:
and no matron, pressing her forehead with the turreted crown4, forbids her, with foot lifted over5, to touch the threshold.
No saffron-coloured veil6 lightly to hide the timid blushes of the bride, concealed her downcast features;
the girdle with its gems did not encircle her flowing robes7, no necklace her graceful neck8;
and no scanty under-tunic9, clinging to the lower part of the shoulders, enveloped her bared arms.
Even so, just as she was, she preserved the mournful ensigns of the garb of woe, and in the way in which her sons, in the same her husband, did she embrace.
Covered by the funereal wool the purple was concealed.
None of the wonted jests1 acted their merry part, nor after the Sabine usage2 did the sorrowing husband receive the festive taunts.
No pledges of the house3, no relations met to­ gether.
They were united in silence, and contented with the auspices of Brutus.
Nor did Cato remove the grim long hair from his hallowed face, or admit of joyousness on his rigid features.
Since first he had beheld the deadly arms upraised, he had allowed the unshorn white hair to descend upon his rugged brow and the woeful beard to grow upon his cheeks.
Because, forsooth, he had leisure for one thing alone-free from factions and from hate--to weep for mankind.
Nor were the ties of their former connexion renewed;
his con­ tinence4 withheld from even lawful love.
These were the manners, this was the unswerving rule of the rigid Cato;
to observe moderation, and to adhere to his end;
to follow the guidance of nature, and to lay down his life for his country;
and not *to believe himself born for himself, but for the whole world.
To subdue hunger was a banquet to him, and to keep away by a mere roof.
the winter's cold, an opulent abode;
to wrap a shaggy toga around his limbs, after the manner of the Roman follower of Quirinus1, was a costly robe;
to him, too, the especial object of sexual desire was offspring ;
he was the City's husband 2, and the City's sire;
a worshipper of justice, an observer of strict honor;
he was a good man for the common weal;
and upon none of Cato's deeds did pleasure, born but for herself, make inroad and exact her share.
In the mean time, Magnus departing with the hastening throng, took possession of the Campanian walls of the Dar­ danian colonist3.
This seat of war was to his mind, for him, exerting all his might, thence to spread abroad his scattered party to meet the foe, where with its shady hills Apennine raises on high the mid part of Italy, than which no land swells with its peaks to a loftier height, or approaches more nigh to Olympus.
The mountain in the midst ex­ tends itself between the two waters of the Lower and the Upper sea4;
and on the one side does Pisa, that, with its shallows, breaks the Etrurian waves, on the other, Ancona, opposed to the Dalmatian billows, bound the mountain ridges.
From vast sources does it produce boundless streams, and extend its rivers along the space that separates the two seas.
On the left side descend both the swift Metaurus5, and the rapid Crustumium1, and the Sapis2 uniting with the Isaurus3, and the Sena4, the Aufidus5, too, that beats the Adriatic waves;
and, (into a river more vast than which no region dissolves itself,) the Eridanus rolls down6 disman­ tled forests into the main, and by its waters empties Hesperia of streams.
The story is, that this river7 was the first to shade its banks with a poplar crown;
and that, when Phaëton, his bounds overstepped, bringing headlong down­ wards the light of day, set the skies on fire with his blazing reins, the streams throughout the scorched earth being swept away, this one had waves equal to quenching the fires of Phœbus.
Not less is it than the Nile, if the Nile did not lie stagnant far and wide over the flat surface of level Egypt, the Libyan sands.
Nor less is it than the Ister, except that while the Ister flows through the globe, it receives streams that might have fallen as rivers into any seas what­ ever, and not by itself is discharged into the Scythian waves.
The waters that seek the right-hand declivities of the mountain range form the Tiber, and the Rutuba8 in its cavities.
Thence downward glide both the swift Vulturnus 1, and the Sarnus 2, the producer of night-like mists, and the Liris3 impelled by the Vestine waters4 through the realms of shady Marica5, and the Siler6, skimming along the cultivated fields of Salernum7;
the Macra8, too, which in its shallows admits of no barks, runs into the sea of neighbouring Luna.
Where, extending still beyond, it rises with its ridges elevated in the air, it beholds the Gallic fields, and looks down upon the declining Alps.
Then, fer­ tile for the Umbrians9 and the Marsians10, and subdued by the Sabine ploughshare1.
embracing with its pine-clad rocks all, the native races of Latium, it deserts not Hesperia before it is cut short by the waves of Scylla2, and extends its rocks to the Lacinian temples3;
longer than Italy, until4 the sea pressing on cut short its boundaries, and the ocean forced back the land.
But after the earth was separated by the two seas, the extremity of the range ended in Sicilian Pelorus \Cæsar, furious for war, is not pleased at6 having a way otherwise than by the shedding of blood, and that he cannot lay waste the limits of Hesperia now free from an enemy, and rush down upon the deserted fields, and he would not lose the advantage of his march1, and would be leading on force hand to hand with force.
It delights him not so much to enter the opening gates, as to have broken them down;
nor so much for the fields to be ploughed by the submitting husbandman, as if the land were laid waste with fire and sword.
By paths permitted he is reluctant to pro­ ceed, and to appear to be a fellow-citizen.
Then the cities of Latium, in doubt, and wavering with varying party feel­ ings, although about to yield at the first alarm of the approaching warfare, still with stout ramparts strengthen their walls, and surround them on every side with the deep trench.
Round masses of stone, too, and darts which may be hurled from above against the foe, they provide upon the lofty towers of the walls.
The multitude is more favourable to Magnus, and attach­ ment struggles with threatening terror;
just as when the south wind, with his dread-sounding blasts, possesses the sea, him do all the billows follow:
if again the earth 2, loosened by the stroke of the Æolian trident, sends forth the eastern gales over the swelling waves, although swept by this fresh one, the billows still retain the effects of the former wind, and while the heavens give way to the eastern winds sweeping along the clouds, the waves still obey the southern gales.
But terror was able readily to change their feelings, and fortune swayed their wavering attachment.
The Etrurian race was left defenceless by the flight of frightened Libo', and now, Thermus repulsed2, Umbria lost the disposal of itself.
Nor with his father's auspices did Sulla wage the civic warfare turning his back, on hearing the name of Cæsar.
Varus, when4 the approach­ ing troops attacked Auximum5, rushing through the walls1 on the opposite side, his rear neglected, flies where are the woods, where are the rocks.
Lentulus is driven 2 from the citadel of Asculum3.
The victor presses upon them re­ treating, and draws over the troops;
and alone out of a force so great the commander escapes, and standards that escort no cohorts4.
Thou, too, Scipio, dost forsake the deserted citadel of Nuceria5, entrusted to thy charge;
although a most hardy youthful band is posted in this camp, some time before withdrawn from Cresar's arms by reason of the Parthian panic;
with which Magnus reinstated the Gallic losses, and, whilst he himself summoned them to the war­ fare, gave to his father-in-law the loan of Roman blood.
But thee, valiant Domitius, the abodes of Corfinium, surrounded by strong walls, receive;
those recruits, which once were placed around the polluted Milo, obey thy trumpet's call.
When he beheld afar an immense cloud arising on the plain, and the ranks shining with weapons glittering in the glistening sun," Run down, my comrades," said he, " to the banks of the river, and sink the bridge under water;
and thou, stream, now come forth, in all thy strength, from thy mountain sources, and collect together all the waters, that with thy foaming tide, thou mayst, the structure broken, bear off the alder timbers.
At this line let the war come to a stand;
upon these banks let the foe at his leisure take his ease.
Put a check upon the headlong leader;
Cæsar first coming to a stop at this spot shall be to us a victory.
"No more having said, he leads down from the walls his active band, in vain.
For when first, from the plains, the river set at liberty3, Cresar beheld his passage being cut off, excited by boiling indignation, he said, " Is it not enough to have sought a lurking-place for your cowardice within walls?
Do you close up the plains, ye cowards, and attempt to keep me in check with streams?
Not, if Ganges with his swelling tide were to separate me, should Cæsar now come to a stand at any river, after the waters of Rubicon.
Hasten on, ye squadrons of horse;
onward, too, ye foot;
ascend the bridge about to fall!"
When this had been said, the light horsemen gave full rein along the plain, and their stalwart arms hurled the darts to the opposite bank, much like a shower thickly falling.
Cæsar enters upon 1 the stream left vacant, its guard being put to flight, and is brought safe to the citadel of the enemy.
And now he was erecting towers to discharge vast masses, and the mantelet2 had moved on beneath the midst of the walls;
when lo!
a crime in warfare3, the gates being opened, the troops dragged forth their captive chief, and before the feet of his haughty fellow-citizen he stood.
Still, his features contemptuously scowling, with undaunted neck did his high-born courage demand the sword.
Cæsar was aware both that punishment was wished for and that pardon was dreaded4.
“ Live on," said he5, " although thou art unwill- ing;
and by my bounty behold the light of day.
To the conquered faction now let there be bright hopes, and the example of myself;
even if it pleases thee try arms once more;
and nothing for this pardon do I stipulate, if thou shalt be overcome.
"He thus speaks, and orders the chains to be loosened on his tightened hands.
Alas!
even his murder perpetrated, how much more becomingly might Fortune have spared a Roman's shame;
to whom it is the very greatest of punish­ ments, to be pardoned because he has followed the camp of his country and Magnus for his leader, and the whole of the Senate.
He, undismayed, checks his heavy wrath, and to himself he says, “ And wilt thou repair, degenerate man, to Rome, and the retreats of peace?
Dost thou not prepare to go into the midst of the frenzy of war, destined soon to die ?
Rush on assured, and burst asunder all delay to losing thy life, and thus be rid of Cæsar's gift.
”In the meantime, not aware of the chieftain being taken, Magnus was preparing arms, that, with strength inter­ mingled, he might recruit his party.
And now, on the ensuing day, about to order the trumpet to sound, and thinking that the resentment of the soldiers about to move might be ascertained, with a voice moving veneration he addressed the silent cohorts:
“ 0 avengers of crimes, and who have followed the preferable standards, 0 truly Roman band, to whom the Senate has given arms in no private cause 1, in your aspirations demand the fight.
With ruthless ravages the fields of Hesperia glow ;
along the icy Alps is poured forth the Gallic rage2;
already has blood touched the polluted swords of Cæsar.
Well have the Gods provided, that we were the first to endure the casualties of war On their side let the criminality commence.“
Now, e'en now, myself the umpire, let Rome seek punishment and vengeance.
Nor indeed is it right for these to be called real battles, but rather the wrath of an avenging country.
No more is this a war than when Catiline prepared1 the torches to blaze amid the houses, and Lentulus the partner in his fury, and the frantic band of Cethegus, with his naked shoulders 2.
0 frenzy of the leader greatly to be pitied !
When, Cæsar, the Fates could wish to enrol thee among the Camilli and the great Me­ telli4, among the Cinnæ5 and the Marii dost thou come.
Assuredly thou shalt be laid prostrate, as by Catulus Le­ pidus fell6, and Carbo, who, submitting7 to my axe, is buried in a Sicilian sepulchre, Sertorius, too1, who, an exi.e, aroused the fierce Iberians.
And yet, if there is any belief in me, I grudge, Cæsar, to add thee as well to these, and that Rome has opposed my hands to thee in thy madness."
Would that Crassus had returned safe after the battles of the Parthians, and victorious from the regions of Scythia, that thou mightst fall by a like cause to that by which the foeman Spartacus fell2.
If the Gods of heaven have ordained that thou as well shalt be added to my titles of triumph, mighty is my right arm at hurling the javelin;
this glowing blood has again waxed warm around my heart;
thou shalt learn, that not all who could submit to peace are cowards in war.
Although he styles me enfeebled and worn out, let not my age alarm you.
In this camp let the chief be more aged a, so long as the soldier is more aged in that.
To whatever height a free people could elevate a citizen, thither have I ascended, and nothing have I left above me but the sovereignty.
No private station does he desire, whoever in the Roman City attempts to be higher than Pompey.
Here on our side either Consul is, here on our side are the ranks of our nobles to take their stand.
Shall Cæsar be the conqueror of the Senate?
Not to that degree, O Fortune!
dost thou drag onward all things in thy blind career and feel ashamed at nothing.“
Does Gaul, rebellious now for many a year1, and an age spent in labours, impart courage?
Is it, because he fled from the cold waves2 of the Rhine, and, calling the shallows3 of a fluctuating sea the ocean, he showed his frightened back to the Britons he had sought out ?
Or do .
vain menaces swell, because the rumour of his frenzy has driven the City in arms from its paternal abodes ?
Alas!
madman, they fly not from thee;
all are following me!
who, when I raised my standards gleaming over the whole ocean, before Cynthia had twice filled her completed orb, the pirate abandoned every ford of the sea, and asked for a home in a narrow allotment of land.
I too, more fortunate than Sulla5, pursued to the death, the monarch hitherto unsub­ dued6 and who stayed the destinies of Rome, flying in exile through the retreats of Scythian Pontus."
No portion of the world is unconnected with me, but the whole earth is occupied by my trophies, under whatever sun it lies.
Hence do the Arctic regions own me as a victor at the cold waves of Phasis7;
a meridian clime is known to me in hot Egypt1, and in Syene2, which on no side diverts its shades.
The west obeys ray laws, and the Hesperian Bætis3, that beyond all rivers dashes into the retreating Tethys.
The subdued Arab4 has known me;
me the He­ niochi, fierce in war5, and the Colchians, famed for the fleece borne away.
My standards do the Cappadocians dread, and Judæa, devoted to the rites of an unknown Goda, and the luxurious Sophene7.
The Armenians, and the fierce Cili­ cians, and the Taurians8 have I subdued.
What war but a civil one to my father-in-law have I left ?
"His partizans followed the words of the chieftain with no applause, nor did they demand the speedy trumpet signal for the promised fight.
Magnus too himself perceived their fears, and it pleased him that his standards should be borne back, and not to expose to the risks of a combat so decisive troops already vanquished by the fame of Cæsar not yet seen by them.
Just as among the herds a bull, worsted in the first combat, seeks the recesses of the woods, and, exiled amid the vacant fields, tries his horns upon the opposing trunks;
and returns not to the pastures, but when, his neck reinvigorated, his muscles exercised give him confidence;
then, soon victorious, the bulls accom­ panying, he leads the recovered herds, maugre the shepherd, to any pastures he lists;
so, unequal in strength, Magnus surrendered Hesperia, and taking to flight over the Apu­ lian fields ascended the secure towers of Brundisiurm1.
This is a city once possessed by Dictæan colonists2, whom, flying from Crete, the Cecropian ships bore along the seas, with sails that falsely told3 that Theseus was con­ quered.
In this region, the coast of Hesperia, which now contracts itself into a narrow arch, extends into the sea a small tongue, which, with its curving horns, shuts in the waves of the Adriatic.
Nor yet would this water inclosed in the narrowed inlet form a harbour, if an island did not receive upon its rocks the violent north-west gales, and turn back the dashing waves.
On the one side and on the other nature has opposed mountains with craggy cliffs to the open main, and has warded off the blasts, so that, held fast by the shaking cables, ships can stand there.
Hence far and wide extends all the ocean, whether the sails are borne, Corcyra, to thy harbours1, or whether on the left Illyrian Epidamnus2 is sought, bordering upon the Ionian waves.
Hither is the flight of mariners, when the Adriatic has put forth all its strength, and the Ceraunia3 have dis­ appeared in clouds, and when the Calabrian Sason4 is washed by the foaming main.
Therefore, when there is no hope in the affairs that have been left behind, and there is no means of turning the warfare to the hardy Iberians, since the Alps, with their immense tracts, lie extended between, then that son5, one of a progeny so great, whose age is more advanced, he thus addresses:
­ "I bid you try the distant regions of the world.
Arouse the Euphrates and the Nile6, even as far as the fame of my name has reached, cities through which the fame of Rome has been spread abroad after myself as her general.
Bring back to the seas the Cilician colonists scattered amid the fields.
On the one side arouse the Pharian kings7 and my friend Tigranes.
And neglect not, I advise thee, the arms of Pharnaces8, nor yet do thou the tribes that wander in either Armenia, and the fierce nations along the shores of Pontus, and the Rhipæan bands1, and those whom on its frozen waves the sluggish swamp of Mæotis2, enduring the Scythian waggon, bears.
But why do I any further delay ?
Throughout the entire East, my son, thou wilt carry the warfare, and awaken all the cities that have been subdued throughout the entire world;
let all my triumphs repair once again to my camp.
You too, who mark the Latiali annals with your names, let the first northern breeze bear you to Epirus ;
thence, throughout the fields of the Greeks and the Macedonians acquire new strength, while winter affords time for peace."
Thus he speaks, and all obey his commands, and unmoor their hollow ships from the shore.
But, never enduring peace and a long cessation from arms, lest it may be in the power of the Fates to work any change, Cæsar follows, and presses hard on the foot­ steps of his son-in-law.
To others would have sufficed so many fortified towns3 captured at the first assault, so many towers overwhelmed, the enemy expelled;
thou thyself, Rome, the Capital of the world, the greatest reward of the warfare, so easy to be taken.
But Cæsar, precipitate in everything, thinking nothing done while anything re­ mains to be done, fiercely pursues;
and still, although he is in possession of the whole of Italy, because Magnus is located on its extreme shores, does he grieve that as yet it is common to them;
nor on the other hand is he willing that the foe should wander on the open main, but with moles he dams out the waves1, and the expansive ocean with rocks hurled down.
To no purpose is this labour bestowed on the immense undertaking;
the voracious sea sucks in all the rocks, and mingles the mountains with its sands;
just as, if the lofty Eryx 2 were thrown down into the midst of the waves of the Ægean Sea, still no rocky heights would tower above the main;
or if Gaurus3, his pinnacles rooted up, were to fall down to the very depths of stagnant Avernus.
There­ fore, when in the shoals no mass retained its weight, then it pleased him, the woods cut down, to connect rafts, and to fasten together with wide extent the trunks of trees by immense chains.
Fame relates that exulting Xerxes constructed4 such a passage over the seas, when, daring great things, with his bridges he joined both Europe to Asia, and Sestos to Aby­ dos1, and walked over the straits of the rapid Hellespont, not fearing Eurus and Zephyrus;
at the time when he would have borne his sails and ships through the midst of Athos.
In such manner are the inlets of the deep narrowed by the fall of the woods;
then with many a mound the work rises apace, and the tall towers vibrate over the seas.
Pompey, seeing the inlets of the deep choked up with land newly-formed, vexed his mind with carking cares how to open the sea, and to spread the warfare over the main.
Full oft, filled by the southern gales, and dragged by extended cables 3 through the obstructions of the sea themselves, ships dashed down into the salt tide the summits of the mass, and made room for the barks4 to enter;
the balista, too, hurled by stalwart arms amid the shades of night, hurled torches cleft into many parts.
When at length the occasion suited for a stolen flight, he first ordered his followers that no sailors' clamour should arouse, or clarion divide;
the hours, or trumpet lead the sailors, instructed beforehand, out to sea.
Now had the Virgin, towards her close1, begun to precede the claws of the Scorpion that were to bring on Phœbus, when in silence the ships wereunmoored.
No anchor arouses their voices2 while from the dense sands its hook is being dragged.
While the sailyards are being set to the wind, and while the lofty pine-tree mast is being raised, the anxious masters of the fleet are silent;
and the sailors, hanging by the ropes, unfurl the tightened sails, nor shake the stout shrouds, lest the air should breathe a whisper.
The chieftain, too, in his aspirations, Fortune, entreats thee, that Italy, which thou dost forbid him to re­ tain, it may be at least allowed him to quit.
Hardly do the Fates permit it;
for with a loud noise, impelled by beaks of ships, the sea re-echoes, the waters dash, and the billows with the tracks of so many ships there intermingled3.
Therefore, the enemy being received by the gates, all of which throughout the city attachment changing with for­ tune has opened, and within the walls, winding along the piers, with precipitate course seek the entrance to the har­ bour, and are vexed that the fleet has reached the sea.
0 shame!
a slight victory is the flight of Pompey!
A narrow pass let the ships out to sea, more limited than the Eubœan tide where it beats upon Chalcis'.
Here stuck fast two ships, and received the grappling-irons pre­ pared for the fleet;
and the warfare being thus dragged to the shore2, here, for the first time, did Nereus grow red with the blood of citizens.
The rest of the fleet departs, de­ spoiled of the two last ships;
just as, when the bark from Pagasæ3 sought the waves of Phasis, the earth shot forth the Cyanean rocks4 into the deep;
less by its stern torn off did the Argo escape from the mountains, and in vain did the Symplegas strike at the vacant sea, and, destined to stand, it bounded back1.
Now, the complexion of the eastern sky no longer the same warns that Phœbus is pressing on, and the pale light is not yet ruddy, and is withdrawing their flames from the nearer stars;
and now the Pleiades 2are dim, now the Wain of the declining Bootes, growing faint, returns to the appearance of the serene heavens, and the larger stars lie hid, and Lucifer himself flies from the warm day.
Now, Magnus, thou hadst gained the open sea, not bearing with thee those destinies which thou wast wont, when over the waves throughout all seas thou didst give chase to the pirate.
Exhausted by thy triumphs, Fortune has forsaken thee.
Banished with wife and children, and dragging all thy household Gods to the warfare, still, a mighty exile thou dost go, nations ac­ companying thee.
A distant spot is sought for thy unworthy downfall4.
Not because the Gods of heaven prefer to deprive thee of a sepulchre in thy native land are the Pharian sands con­ demned to be thy tomb.
It is Hesperia that is spared ;
in order that, afar off, in a remote region, Fortune may hide the horrid deed, and the Roman land be preserved un­ spotted by the blood of her own Magnus.
While Pompey is crossing to Greece, the ghost of Julia appears to him in a dream, and predicts the devastating nature of the war, 1-35.
Pompey arrives in Epirus, 36-45. Caesar instructs Curio to procure corn in Sicily, 46-70.
He then marches to Rome, 76-97.
The alarm at Rome de­ scribed.
The hostility of the Senate to Caesar.
Metellus the Tribune resists the spoilers of the public treasury, 98-133.
Cæsar threatens him, 134-140. Cotta advises Metellus to yield, 141-152.
The Temple is opened, and the treasure is carried off, 153-168.
In the meantime Pompey collects forces in Greece and Asia, which are enumerated, 169- 297.
Caesar, on his way to Spain, repairs to Massilia, which has remained faithful to Pompey, 298-303.
The people of Massilia send deputies to him, deprecating civil war, 304-357.
Cæsar besieges Massilia, 358-374.
The works are described, 374-398.
Caesar commands a sacred grove to be cut down, and forces the soldiers, though reluctant, to do so, 399-452.
Departing for Spain, he entrusts the siege to Trebonius, by whom it is continued, 453-496.
The Massilians sally -forth by night and repulse the enemy, 497-508.
The attack is now carried on by sea.
Brutus arrives with his fleet, 509-537.
The sea-fight is described, 538- 751.
The Massilians are vanquished, and Brutus is victorious, 752-762.WHEN the south-wind pressing upon the yielding sails urged on the fleet, and the ships set in motion the middle of the deep, each sailor looked upon the Ionian waves;
Magnus alone did not turn his eyes from the Hesperian land, while he beheld his country's harbours, and the shores des­ tined never to return to his gaze, and the peaks hidden in clouds, and the dim mountains, vanish.
Then did the wearied limbs of the chieftain yield to sopor.
ferous slumber.
Then, a ghost, full of dread horror, Julia1 seemed to raise her sorrowing head through the yawning earth, and to stand like a Fury2 above the lighted pyre.
"Exiled," said she3, "from the Elysian abodes and the fields of the Blessed, unto the Stygian shades and the guilty ghosts, since the civil warfare have I been dragged.
I my­ self have beheld the Eumenides holding torches, the which to brandish against your arms.
The ferryman of scorched Acheron1 is preparing boats innumerable, and Tartarus is expanding for manifold punishments.
Hardly with plying right hand do all the Sisters suffice for the work;
those who are breaking their threads quite weary the Destinies.
While I was thy wife, Magnus, thou didst head the joyous triumphal processions;
with thy marriage Fortune has changed;
and ever condemned by fate to drag her mighty husbands to ruin, lo!
my funereal pile still warm, the supplanter Cornelia has married thoc.
“Let her, in war and upon the deep, adhere to thy standards, so long as it is allowed me to break thy slumbers not secure from care, and let no time be left at leisure for your love, but both let Cæsar occupy thy days and Julia thy nights3.
Me, husband, not the obliviousness of the Lethæan shore has made forgetful of thyself, and the princes of the dead have allowed me to follow thee.
Thou waging the warfare, I will come into the midst of the ranks.
Never, Magnus, by the Shades and by my ghost shall it be allowed thee not to have been his son-in-law.
In vain dost thou sever thy ties with the sword, the civic warfare shall make thee mine."
Thus having said, the ghost, gliding away through the embrace of her trem­ bling husband, fled.
He, although the Deities and the Shades threaten de­ struction, rushes the more boldly to arms, with a mind assured of ill.
And, “Why," says he, ” are we alarmed at the phantom of an unsubstantial dream ?
Either there is no sense left in the mind after death, or else death itself is nothing."
Now the setting Titan was sinking in the waves, and had plunged into the deep as much of his fiery orb as is wont to be wanting to the moon, whether she is about to be at full, or whether she has just been full;
then did the hospitable land present an easy access to the ships;
they coiled up the ropes, and, the masts laid down, with oars they made for the shore.
Cæsar, when the winds bore off the ships thus escaping, and the seas had hidden the fleet, and he stood the sole ruler on the Hesperian shore, no glory in the expulsion of Magnus caused joy to him;
but he complained that the enemy had turned their backs in safety upon the deep.
Nor, indeed, did any fortune now suffice for the eager hero;
nor was conquest of such value that he should delay the warfare.
Then did he expel from his breast .
the care for arms and become intent upon peace, and in what manner he might conciliate the fickle attachment of the populace, fully aware that both the causes of anger and the highest grounds of favour originate in supplies of corn.
For it is famine alone that makes cities free, and respect is purchased when the powerful are feeding a sluggish multi­ tude.
A starving commonalty knows not how to fear1.
Curio is ordered to pass over2 into the Sicilian cities, where the sea has either overwhelmed the land with sudden waves or has cut it asunder and made the mid-land3 a shore for itself.
There, is a vast conflict of the main, and the waves are ever struggling, that the mountains, burst asunder, may not reunite their utmost verges.
The war, too1, is extended even to the Sardinian coasts.
Each island is famous for its corn-bearing fields ;
nor more do any lands fill Hesperia with harvests brought from afar, nor to a greater extent supply the Roman granaries.
Hardly in fertility of soil does it excel them, when, the south winds pausing2, Boreas sweep­ ing the clouds downwards to a southern clime, Libya bears a plenteous year from the falling showers.
When these tilings had been provided for by the chief­ tain, then, victorious, he repaired to the abodes of his country, not bringing with him bands of armed men, but having the aspect of peace.
Oh!
if he had re­ turned to the City, the nations of the Gauls and the North only subdued, what a long line of exploits might be have paraded before him in the lengthened procession of triumph a, what representations of the warfare!
How might he have placed chains upon the Rhine and upon the ocean!
How high-spirited Gaul would have followed his lofty chariot, and mingled with the yellow-haired Britons!
Alas!
by conquering still more what a triumph was it4 that he lost!
Not with joyous crowds did the cities see him as he went along, but silent they beheld him with alarm.
Nowhere was there the multitude coming forth to meet the chieftain.
Still, he rejoiced that he was held in such dread by the people, and he would prefer himself not to be loved.
And now, too, he has passed over the steep heights of Anxur1, and where the watery way divides the Pontine marshes.
Where, too, is the lofty grove, where the realms of Scythian Diana2 ;
and where there is the road for the Latian fasces to lofty Alba.
Afar from a lofty rock he now views the City, not beheld by him during the whole period of his northern wars;
and, thus speaking, he admires the walls of his Rome:
­ "
And have there been men, forced by no warfare, to de­ sert thee, the abode of the Gods!
For what city will they fight?
The Gods have proved more favouring in that it is no Eastern fury that now presses upon the Latian shores, nor yet the swift Sarmatian in common with the Pannonian, and the Getans mingled with the Dacians.
Fortune, Rome, has spared thee, having a chief so cowardly4, in that the warfare was a civil one.
"Thus he speaks, and he enters Rome stupefied with terror;
for he is supposed to be about to overthrow the walls of Rome as though captured, with dusky fires, and to scatter abroad the Gods.
This is the extent of their fear;
they think that he is ready to do whatever he is able.
No festive omens are there, no pretending feigned applause with joyous uproar;
hardly is there time to hate.
The throng of Senators fills the Palatine halls of Phoebus' drawn forth from their concealment, by no right of convoking the Senate.
The sacred seats are not graced with the Consul, no Præ­ tor is there, the next power according to law;
and the empty curule seats 2 have been removed from their places.
Cæsar is everything.
The Senate is present, witness to the words of a private person.
The Fathers sit, prepared to give their sanction, whether he shall demand a kingdom, whether a Temple for himself, the throats, too, of the Senate, and their exile.
Fortunate was it that he blushed at commanding, more than Rome did at obeying.
Still, liberty, making the ex­ periment in one man whether the laws can possibly with­ stand force, gives rise to anger;
and the resisting Metellus3, when he beholds the Temple of Saturn being forced open by vast efforts, hurries his steps, and bursting through the troops of Cæsar, takes his stand before the doors of the Temple not yet opened.
(To such a degree does the love of gold alone know not how to fear the sword and death.
Swept away, the laws perish with no contest;
but thou, pelf, the most worthless portion of things, dost excite the contest;
) and, forbidding the conqueror the plunder, the Tribune with loud voice addresses him:
" Only through my sides shall the Temple struck by thee be opened, and, plunderer, thou shalt carry off no scattered wealth except by shedding sacred blood.
Surely this violated power will find the Gods its avengers.
The Tribune's curse, tool, following Crassus to the warfare, prayed for the direful battles.
Now unsheathe the sword;
for the multitude is not to be regarded by thee, the spectator of thy crimes:
in a deserted City do we stand.
No soldier accursed shall bear off his reward from our Treasury;
nations there are for thee to overthrow, walls for thee to grant.
Want does not drive thee to the spoils of exhausted peace;
Cæsar, thou hast a war of thy own.
”
2The victor, aroused by these words to extreme anger, exclaims, "Thou dost conceive vain hopes of a glorious death:
my hand, Metellus, shall not pollute itself with that throat of thine.
No honor shall make thee deserving of the resentment of Caesar.
Has liberty been left safe, thee its assertor?
Not to that degree has length of time con­ founded the highest with the lowest, that the laws, if they are to be preserved by the voice of Metellus, would not prefer by Cæsar to be uprooted.
"He spoke, and, the Tribune not yet retreating from the door, his anger became more intense;
he looked around upon the ruthless swords, forgetful to pretend that there was peace1.
Then did Cotta2 persuade Metellus to desist from his too audacious purpose.
"
The liberty of a people," said he, “ which a tyrant's sway is ruling, perishes through excess of liberty;
of it thou mayst preserve the shadow, if thou art ready to do whatever thou art commanded.
To so many unjust things have we, conquered, submitted ;
this is the sole excuse for our shame and our degenerate fears, that nothing can possibly now be dared.
Quickly let him carry off the evil incentives to direful warfare.
Injuries move the people, if any there are, whom their laws pro­ tect.
Not to ourselves, but to our tyrant, is the poverty dangerous that acts the slave.
"Forthwith, Metellus led away, the Temple was opened wide.
Then did the Tarpeian rock re-echo, and with a loud peal attest that the doors were opened;
then, stowed away in the lower part of the Temple, was dragged up, un­ touched for many a year, the wealth of the Roman people, which the Punic wars3, which Perseus4, which the booty of the conquered Philip5, had supplied;
that which, Rome, Pyrrhus left to thee in his hurrying flight, the gold for which Fabricius did not sell himself1 to the king, whatever you saved, manners of our thrifty forefathers;
that which, as tribute, the wealthy nations of Asia had sent, and Minoïan Crete3 had paid to the conqueror Metellus ;
that, too, which Cato brought from Cyprus4 over distant seas.
Besides, the wealth of the East, and the remote treasures of captive kings, which were borne before him in the triumphal processions of Pompey5, were carried forth;
the Temple was spoiled with direful rapine;
and then for the first time was Rome poorer than Cæsar6.
In the meantime the fortune of Magnus throughout the whole earth has aroused to battle the cities destined to fall with him.
Greece near at hand affords forces for the neighbouring war.
Amphissa sends7 Phocian bands, the rocky Cirrha8 too, and Parnassus deserted on either mountain ridge.
The Boeotian leaders assemble, whom the swift Cephisus9 surrounds with its fate-foretelling waters.
Cadmean Dirce, too1, and the bands of Pisae, and the Alpheus that sends beneath the main its waters to the peoples of Sicily.
Then does the Arcadian leave Mænalus4, and the Trachynian soldier Herculean Œta5.
The Thesprotians6 and the Dryopians7 rush on, and the ancient Sellæ8 forsake the silent oaks on the Chaonian heights.
Although the levy has exhausted9 the whole of Athens, three little barks keep possession of the Phœbean dockyards1, and demand Salamis to be believed as true2..
Now, beloved by Jove3 ancient Crete with its hundred peoples resorts to arms, both Gnossus skilled4 at wielding the quiver, and Gortyna not inferior to the arrows of the East5.
Then, too, he who possesses Dardanian Oricum6, and the wandering Athamanians7 dispersed amid the towering woods, and the Enchelians8 with their ancient name, who witnessed the end of the transformed Cadmus, the Colchian Absyrtis, too1, that foams down to the Adriatic tide, and those who cultivate the fields of Peneus2, and by whose labours the Thessalian ploughshare cleaves Hæmonian Iolcos.
From that spot for the first time was the sea at­ tempted when the untaught Argo3 mingled unknown races upon a polluted sea-shore4, and first committed the mortal race to the winds and the raging waves of the ocean, and through that bark one more death was added to the destinies of man.
Then Thracian Hæmus is deserted, and Pholoë that feigned5 the two-formed race.
Strymon is abandoned 6, accustomed to send the Bistonian birds to the warm Nile, and the barbarian Cone7, where one mouth of the Ister, divided into many parts, loses the Sarmatian waves, and washes Peuce sprinkled by the main;
Mysia, too8, and the Idalian land bedewed by the cold Caïcus9, and Arisbe1 very barren in its soil.
Those, too, who inhabit Pitane2, and Celænæ3, which, Pallas, condemned when Phœbus was victor, laments thy gifts.
Where, too, the swift Marsyas4 descending with his straight banks approaches the wandering Mæander, and, mingling, is borne back again;
the land, too, that permits the Pactolus5 to flow forth from its gold-bearing mines, not less invaluable than which the Hermus divides the fields.
The bands of Ilium, too, with omens their own7, seek the standards and the camp doomed to fall;
nor does the story of Troy restrain them, and Cæsar declaring himself!!
the descendant of Phrygian Iulus.
The nations of Syria came;
the deserted Orontes9, and Nines so wealthy10 (as the story is), and windy Damascus11, and Gaza1, and Idumæa2 rich in its groves of palms.
Un­ stable Tyre as well 3, and Sidon precious with its purple dye.
These ships did the Cynosure conduct4 to the warfare by no winding track along the sea, more certain for no other barks.
The Phœnicians first, if belief is given to report, ventured to represent in rude characters the voice destined to endure.
Not yet had Memphis learned to unite5 the rushes of the stream;
and only animals engraved upon stones, both birds and wild beasts, kept in ex­ istence the magic tongues °.
The forest, too, of Taurus is deserted, and Persean Tarsus1, and the Corycian cave opening with its rocks worn away.
Mallus and remote Ægæ4 resound with their dockyards, and the Cilician ship:
goes forth obedient to the law, no longer a pirate now.
The rumour, too, of the warfare has moved the corners of the East, where Ganges is worshipped, who alone through­ out all the world dares to discharge himself by a mouth opposite6 to the rising sun, and impels his waves towards the opposing eastern winds;
here it was that the chieftain from Pella7, arriving beyond the seas of Tethys.
stopped short, and confessed that he was conquered by the vast earth.
Where, too, Indus carrying along his rapid stream with di­ vided flood is not sensible of the Hydaspes mingling" with his waters.
Those also, who drink the sweet juices 9 from the tender cane, and those, who, tinting their hair1 with the yellow drug, bind their flowing linen garments2 with coloured gems.
Those also, who build up their own funereal pyres, and, alive, ascend the heated piles a.
Oh!
how great a glory is it to this race to hasten their fate by their own hands, and, full of life, to present to the Deities what still remains!
The fierce Cappadocians come;
the people, now inha­ bitants of the hardy Amanus4, and the Armenian who possesses the Niphates5 that rolls down rocks;
the Coatræ6 have quitted the woods that touch the skies.
You, Arabians, have come into a world to you unknown, wondering how the shadows of the groves do not fall on the left hand.
Then did the Roman frenzy influence the extreme Oretæ 1, and the Caramanian chieftains 2, whose sky declining towards the south3, beholds Arctus set, but not the whole of it;
and there the swiftly-moving Boötes shines but a small part of the night.
The region, too, of the Æthiopians, which would not be overhung by any portion of the sky that bears the Constellations 4, did not, his knee inclining downward, the extremity of the hoof of the bending Bull extend beyond the Zodiac.
And where with the rapid Tigris5 the vast Euphrates takes his rise, streams which Persia sends forth from no different sources;
and it is uncertain, if the earth were to mix the rivers, which name in preference there would be for the waters.
But, spreading over the fields the fertile Euphrates performs the part of6 the Pharian waves;
while the earth with a sudden chasm sucks up the Tigris, and conceals his hidden course, and does not exclude the river born again from a new source from the waters of the sea.
Between the ranks of Cæsar and the opposing standards the warlike Parthians held a neutral ground, content that they had made them but two1.
The wandering tribes of Scythia dipped their arrows, whom Bactros2 encircles with its icy stream, and Hyrcania' with its vast forests.
On this side the Lacedæmonian Heniochi4, a nation fierce in wielding the rein, and the Sarmatian, the neighbour of the savage Moschi5.
Where the Phasis cleaves the most wealthy fields of the Colchians;
where runs the Halys" fatal to Crœsus;
where falling from the Rhipæan heights the Tanais has given7 the names of different parts of the world to its banks, and, the same boundary both of Europe and of Asia, cutting through the confines of the mid part of the earth, now in this direction, now in that, whichever way it turns, enlarges the world1.
Where, too, the flowing strait pours forth the waves of Mæotis, and the Euxine sea is borne away, a vaunt wrested from2 the limits of Hercules, and denies that Gades alone a admits the ocean.
In this part the Essedonian nations4, and thou, Arimaspian5, tying thy locks bound up with gold;
in this the bold Arian, and the Massagetan 6 satisfying the long fast of Sarmatian warfare with the horse on which he flies, and the rapid Geloni7.
Not, when Cyrus leading forth his forces from the Mem­ nonian realms8, and with his troops counted by the throwing of their darts, the Persian came down9, and, when the avenger of his brother's love1 beat the waves with so many fleets, did sovereigns so numerous have one leader.
Nor ever did races unite so varied in their dress, languages of people so different.
Nations thus numerous did Fortune arouse to send as companions in his mighty downfall, and as obsequies worthy of the end of Magnus.
Horn-bearing Ammon did not delay to send the Marmarian troops a to the warfare;
however far parched Libya extends from the western Moors, even to the Parætonian Syrtes on the eastern shores.
Lest fortunate Cæsar might not meet with all at once, Pharsalia gave the whole world to be subdued at the same moment.
He, when he quitted the walls of trembling Rome, swept across the cloud-capt Alps with his hastening troops;
and while other nations were alarmed with terror at his fame, the Phocæan youth5 amid doubtful fortunes dared to pre serve their fidelity6 with no Grecian fickleness, and their plighted faith, and to adhere to the cause and not the fortune.
Yet first they attempted with peaceful words to modify the impetuous wrath and stubborn feelings of the hero, and, a branch of the Cecropian Minerva1 being borne before, they entreated the approaching enemy in these terms:
—“ That always in foreign wars Massilia took part in common with your people, whatever age is comprehended in the Latian annals, that same bears witness.
And now, if in an unknown world thou art seeking any triumphs, receive the right hands that are pledged to foreign warfare.
But if, discordant, you are preparing a deadly strife, if direful battles, to civil arms we give our tears and our dissent.
By our hands let no accursed wounds be meddled with.
If to the inhabitants of heaven fury had given arms, or if the earth- born Giants were aiming at the stars, still not either by arms or by prayers would human piety presume to give aid to Jove;
and the mortal race, ignorant of the fortunes of the Gods, only by his lightnings would be sensible that still the Thunderer reigns in heaven.
Besides, nations innumerable are meeting together on every side, nor does the slothful world so shudder at the contact of wickedness that the civil war stands in need of coerced swords...
Would, indeed, that there were the same feelings in all, that they would refuse to hurry on your destiny, and that no strange soldier would wage these battles.
On beholding his parent, whose right hand will not grow weak?
Brothers, too, on opposite sides, will forbear to hurl the darts.
An end is there to your state, if you do not wage war with those 2 with whom it is lawful.
This is the sum of our prayer;
leave the threatening eagles and the hostile standards afar from the city, and be willing to entrust thyself to our walls, and permit, Cæsar being admitted, the warfare to be shut out.
Let this place, exempt from crime, be safe to Magnus and to thee, that, if fate wishes well to the unconquered City, if a treaty pleases, there may be a place to which you may repair unarmed."
Or else, when the dangers so great of the Iberian warfare invite you, why do you turn aside to us in your rapid march ?
We are of no weight in affairs, we are not of moment, a multitude that never has enjoyed prospering arms, exiled from the original abodes of our country, and, after the towers of burnt Phocis' were transferred safe on foreign shores, within humble walls, whom fidelity alone makes renowned.
If by siege thou dost prepare to block up our walls, and by force to break through our gates, we are prepared to receive on our roofs the torches and the darts, to seek, the streams being turned aside, draughts of water rescued' from your force, and, thirsting, to suck at the dug up earth;
and, if bounteous Ceres should fail, then with stained jaws to eat things horrid to be looked upon and foul to be touched.
Nor does this people fear to suffer for liberty that which Saguntum, besieged3 in the Punic warfare, underwent.
Torn from the bosoms of their mothers, and vainly drawing at the breasts dried up with thirst, the children shall be hurled into the midst of the flames.
The wife, too, from her dear husband shall demand her death.
Brothers shall exchange wounds, and by compulsion this civil war in pre­ ference will they wage.
"4Thus does the Grecian youth make an end;
when, now betrayed by his agitated features, the anger of the chieftain at length in a loud voice testifies his sorrow:
—" Vainly does assurance of my haste encourage you Greeks.
Even though we should be speeding onward to the furthest regions of the west, still there is time to raze Massilia.
Rejoice, ye cohorts;
by the favour of the Fates a war is presented before you.
As the wind loses its strength unless the dense woods meet it with their oaks, being dissipated in empty space ;
so it is harmful to me that foes should be wanting;
and we think it an injury to our arms, unless those who could be conquered rebel.
But if I go alone, degenerate, with arms laid aside, then are their dwellings open to me.
Now, not so much to shut me out, but to inclose me, do they wish.
But yet they would keep afar the direful contagion of war forsooth.
You shall suffer retribution1 for suing for peace;
and you shall learn that, during my life, there is nothing more safe than warfare, myself the leader.
"After he has thus spoken, he turns his march towards2 the fearless city;
then he beholds the walls shut, and for­ titled by a dense band of youths.
Not far from the walls a mound of earth rising aloft, its top widening, spreads out a little plain;
this rock seems to the chieftain fitted to be surrounded with a long fortification, and very well suited for a safe encampment.
The nearest part of the city rises with a high citadel, equal in height to the mound, and fields are situate in the valley between.
Then did a thing please him, to be brought about with immense labour, to join the separated elevations by a vast mound.
But first, that he might inclose the entire city, where it is surrounded by the earth, Cæsar drew a long work from the camp to the sea, and, encircling the springs and the pastures of the plain with a fosse, with turf and unmixed earth he raised out­ works that elevated their numerous towers.
Well worthy now to be remembered did this befall the Grecian city, and an eternal honor, that, not provoked at first 1, nor yet prostrated by very fear, it stayed the headlong course of a war that raged on every side, and all others being seized instantaneously by Cæsar, it alone was conquered with delay.
How much is it that his destinies are stayed, and that Fortune, hastening to set her hero over the whole world, loses these days!
Then far and wide do all the forests fall, and the woods are spoiled of their oaks, that, as crumbling earth and twigs keep up the middle of the mass, the wood may keep close the earth knit together by the framed construction of its sides, that the mound being pressed down 2 may not give way beneath the towers.
There was a grove, never violated during long ages, which with its knitted branches shut in the darkened air and the cold shade, the rays of the sun being far removed.
This no rustic Pans, and Fauns and Nymphs all-powerful in the groves, possessed, but sacred rites of the Gods barbarous in their ceremonial, and elevations crowned with ruthless altars, and every tree was stained1 with human gore.
If at all, antiquity, struck with awe at the Gods of heaven, has been deserving of belief, upon these branches, too, the birds of the air dread to perch, and the wild beasts to lie in the caves;
nor does any wind blow upon those groves, and lightnings hurled from the dense clouds;
a shuddering in themselves 2 prevails among the trees that spread forth their branches to no breezes.
Besides, from black springs plen­ teous water falls, and the saddened images of the Gods are devoid of art, and stand unsightly formed from hewn trunks.
The very mouldiness and paleness of the rotting wood now renders people stricken with awe:
not thus do they dread the Deities consecrated with ordinary forms;
so much does it add to the terror not to know what Gods they are in dread of.
Fame, too, reported that full oft the hollow ca­ verns roared amid the earthquake, and that yews that had fallen rose again, and that flames shone from a grove that did not burn, and that serpents embracing the oaks en­ twined around them.
The people throng that place with no approaching wor­ ship, but have left it to the Gods.
When Phœbus is in the mid sky, or dark night possesses the heavens, the priest himself dreads the approach, and is afraid to meet with the guardian of the grove 4.
This forest he commanded to fall beneath the aimed iron;
for close by the works and untouched in former war it stood most dense in growth amid the bared mountains.
But the valiant bands trembled, and, moved by the venerable sanctity of the place, they believed that if they should touch the sacred oaks, the axes would rebound back against their own limbs.
Cæsar, when he beheld his cohorts involved in great alarm, first daring to poise a hatchet snatched up, and with the iron to cut down the towering oak, the iron being buried in the violated wood, thus says:
" Now then, that no one of you may hesitate to hew down the wood, believe that I have incurred the guilt.
OfThen did all the throng obey, not, all fear removed, free from care, but the wrath of the Gods and of Cæsar being weighed.
Down fall the ashes, the knotty holm-oak is hurled down;
the wood of Dodona, too, and the alder more suited to the waves, the cypress, too, that bears witness to no ple­ beian1 funeral mourning, then first lay aside their foliage, and, spoiled of leaves, admit the day, and thrown down with its trunks thickly set the falling wood supports itself.
Looking on, the nations of the Gauls lament, but the youth shut up within the walls exult.
For who can suppose that the Gods are insulted with impunity?
Fortune spares many that are guilty;
and only with the wretched can the Deities be angered.
And when enough of the grove is cut down, they bring waggons, sought amid the fields;
and the hus­ bandmen bewail, the oxen being carried off, the yearly pro­ duce of the soil relaxed from the curving plough.
The general, however, impatient with a contest destined to linger on before the walls, turning towards the Spanish forces and the extremities of the world, orders the warfare to be carried on2.
A mound is erected with props studded with iron 3, and receives two towers equalling the walls in height;
these are fastened with no wood to the earth, but moved along a lengthened space, the cause lying concealed.
When so great a mass was tottering, the youth supposed that the wind seeking to burst forth had shaken the empty recesses of the earth, and wondered that their walls were standing
Thence did the darts fall upon the lofty citadel of the city.
But a greater power was there in the Grecian weapons against the Roman bodies.
For the lance, not hurled by arms alone, but discharged by the tightened whirlwind force of the balista, did not, content to pass through but one side, cease in its course;
but, opening a way through both arms and through bones, death left behind, it flies on:
after the wound a career still remains for the weapon.
But as often as a stone is hurled by the vast impulse of the blow, just as a rock, which old age, aided by the power of the winds, has separated from the height of the mountain, rushing onwards it bears down everything;
and not only deprives of life the bodies it has dashed against, but scatters in every direction whole limbs together with the blood.
But when, sheltered beneath the stout tortoise1, valour approaches the hostile walls, and the foremost bear arms connected with the arms of those behind, and the uplifted shield protects the helmet, those which, before hurled from the distant retreats, proved destructive, now fall behind their backs;
nor is it now an easy task to the Greeks to direct their charges, or to change the level of their engines of war adapted for hurling weapons to a distance;
but, content with heavy masses alone, they hurl down stones with their bared arms.
While the connected chain of arms1 exists, just as roofs rattle, struck by the harmless hailstones, so does it ward off all the missiles;
but after the excited valour of the men, the soldiers being wearied, breaks down the lengthened fence, single arms give way beneath the continuous blows.
Then, covered with light earthy the mantelet moves on, concealed under the sheds and screened front of which they now attempt to undermine the lower part of the walls, and with iron implements to overthrow them;
now the batter­ ing ram, more mighty with its suspended blows, impelled endeavours to loosen the texture of the solid wall, and to strike away one from the stones placed above.
But struck by flames from above and fragments of vast masses, and many a stake, and the blows of oaks hardened by fire, the hurdle roof, smitten, gives way;
and, his labour spent in vain, the wearied soldier seeks again the tents.
It was at first the greatest wish of the Greeks that their walls might stand.
Now, still further, they prepare to make a charge with their troops;
and, attacking by night, they conceal under their arms blazing torches, and the bold youth sally forth 4;
no spear, no death-dealing bow, but fire, is the weapon of the men, and the wind sweeping onward the flames bears them throughout the Roman fortifications with a swift course.
Nor, although it struggles with green timber, does the fire display slight strength;
but borne away from every torch it follows after extended volumes of black smoke;
it consumes not only the wood but huge stones, and the solid rocks dissolve into dust.
The mound falls prostrate, and as it lies still longer does it appear.
Hope by land now departed from the conquered, and it pleased them to try their fortune on the deep sea.
Not with painted oak did the resplendent tutelary Deity1 grace the ornamented barks, but rough, and just as the tree falls on the mountains, is a firm surface put together for the naval warfare.
And now, attending the towered ship of Brutus, the fleet had come into the waves of the Rhone with the tide, making for the land of Stœchas 3.
The Gre­ cian youth4 as well was wishful to entrust all its strength to the Fates, and armed the aged men with the lads 5 inter­ mingled.
Not only did the fleet, which was then standing on the waves, receive the men;
they sought again, too, the ships worn out in the dock-yards.
When Phœbus, spreading his morning rays upon the seas, has refracted them on the waters, and the sky is free from clouds, and, Boreas being banished and the south winds holding their peace, prepared for the warfare the sea lies calm, each one moves his ship from each station, and by equal arms on the one side the ships of Cæsar, on the other by Grecian rowers the fleet is impelled;
urged on by oars the ships shake again, and the repeated strokes move on the lofty barks.
Both strong three-oared galleys, and those which the rising ranks of rowers built up fourfold, . move on, and those which dip in the seas still more pine­ wood oars, ships in numbers, surround the wings of the Roman fleet.
This force breasts the open sea.
In the centre, in form of a crescent, the Libumian barks 1, content to increase with two ranks of oars, fall back.
But the Præ­ tori an ship of Brutus more lofty than all is impelled by six tiers of oars, and carries a tower along the deep, and seeks the seas from afar with its highest oars.
Where there is just so much sea intervening that either fleet could cross over to the other with the oars once pulled.
innumerable voices are mingled in the vast expanse;
and the sound of the oars is drowned in the clamour, nor can any trumpets be heard.
Then they skim along the azure main, and stretch along the benches, and strike their breasts with the oars.
When first beaks meeting beaks send forth a sound, the ships run astern, and the hurled darts as they fall fill the air and the vacant deep.
And. now, the prows separated, the wings extend, and, the fleet.
sundered, the opposing ships are received.
Just as, so oft as the tide struggles against the Zephyrs and the eastern gales, in this direction run the waves, in that the sea;
so, when the ships in the ploughed-up tide describe their vary­ ing tracks, the sea which the one fleet impels onwards with its oars, the other beats back.
But the pine-tree ships of the Greeks were skilful both to.
challenge to the battle and to resort to flight, and to change their course with no wide sweep, and with no tardiness to obey the turning helm.
But the Roman ship was more sure in affording a keel firmly laid, and convenience to the warriors equal to the dryland.
Then said Brutus to the pilot sitting at the ensign-bearing stem :
“Dost thou suffer the battle to be shifting about upon the deep, and dost thou contend with the vagaries of the ocean ?
Now close the warfare;
oppose the mid part of the vessels to the Phocæan beaks.
"He obeyed, and sidelong he laid the alder barks before the foe.
Then, whatever ship tried the oaken sides of that of Brutus, conquered by her own blow, captured, she stuck fast1 to the one she had struck.
But others both grappling-irons united and smooth chains,and they held themselves on by the oars:
! ;
on the covered sea the warfare stood fixed to the same spot.
Now no longer are the darts hurled from the shaken arms, nor do the wounds fall from afar by means of the hurled weapons;
and hand meets hand.
In a naval fight the sword effects the most.
Each one stands upon the bulwark of his own ship, facing full the blows of the enemy;
and none fall slain in their own vessels.
The deep blood foams in the waves, and the tide is thickened with clotted gore.
The ships, too, which the chains of iron thrown on board are dragging, the same do the dead bodies clogged together hinder from being united.
Some, half-dead, fall into the vast deep, and drink of the sea mingled with their own blood.
Some, adhering to life struggling with slowly-coming death, perish in the sudden wreck of the dismantled ships.
Javelins, missing their aim, accomplish their slaughter in the sea, and whatever weapon falls, with its weight used to no purpose, finds a wound on being received in the midst of the waves.
A Roman ship hemmed in by Phocæan barks, its crew di­ vided, with equal warfare defends the right side and the left;
from the high stern of which, while Tagus maintains the fight, and boldly seizes hold of the Grecian flag 3 , he is pierced both in back and breast at the same moment by hurled darts;
in the midst of his breast the iron meets, and the blood stands, uncertain from which wound to flow, until the plenteous gore at the same time expels both the spears, and rends asunder his life, and scatters death in the wounds.
Hither also the right hand of hapless Telon directed his ship, than which no hand more aptly, when the sea was boisterous, did the barks obey;
nor was the morrow's weather better known to any one, whether he looks at Phœ­ bus or whether at the horns of the moon, in order always to trim the sails to the coming winds.
He with the beak had broken the ribs of a Latian bark;
but quivering javelins entered the middle of his breast, and the right hand of the dying pilot turned away the ship.
While Gyareus attempted to leap on board the friendly bark, he received the iron driven through his suspended entrails, and pinned to the ship, the dart holding him back, there he hung.
Two twin brothers are standing, the glory of their fruitful mother, whom the same womb bore to differing fates.
Cruel death separates the heroes;
and the wretched parents recog­ nize the one left behind, all mistake being now removed, a cause for everlasting tears.
He always renews their grief, and presents his lost brother to them as they mourn.
Of these, the one, the oars of two ships being mingled sideways, comb-like indented, dares from a Grecian stern to lay hands upon1 a Roman bark, but from above a heavy blow lops it off;
still, however, with the effort with which it has grasped it keeps hold, and as it dies, holding fast with tightened nerve, it stiffens.
By his mischance his valour waxes stronger;
mutilated, more high-spirited wrath has he, and he renews the combat with valorous left hand, and about to tear away his right hand he stretches out over the waves.
This hand, too, is cut off with the entire arm.
Now de­ prived of shield and weapons, he is not stowed away in the bottom of the ship, but, exposed and covering his brother's arms with his naked breast, pierced by many a spear, he still persists;
and weapons that were to have fallen to the de­ struction of many of his own friends he receives with a death that he has now earned.
Then he summons his life, fleeting with many a wound, into his wearied limbs, and nerves his members with all the blood that is remaining, and, his members failing in strength, he leaps on board the hostile bark, destined to injure it by his weight alone.
The ship, heaped up with the slaughter of the men, and filled with much blood, received numerous blows on its slanting sides.
But after, its ribs broken, it let in the sea being filled to the top of the hatches, it descended intothe waves, sucking in the neighbouring waters with a whirling eddy.
Cleft asunder by the sunk ship, the waves divided, and in the place of the bark the sea closed up.
Many wondrous instances of various fates besides did that day afford upon the main.
While a grappling-iron was fastening its grasping hooks upon a ship, it fixed on Lycidas.
He would have been sunk in the deep;
but his friends hindered it and held fast his suspended thighs.
Tom away he is rent in two ;
nor, as though from a wound, does his blood slowly flow;
the veins torn asunder 1, on every side it falls;
and the down­ ward flow of his life's blood passing into his rent limbs is intercepted by the waters.
The life of no one slain is parted with by a passage so great;
the lower part of him muti­ lated gives to death the limbs deprived of their vitals;
but where the swelling lungs are situate, where the entrails are warm, there does death delay for a long time;
and having struggled much with this portion of the man, hardly does it take possession of all the limbs.
While, too eager for fight, the company of one ship is pressing straight against the side, and leaves the deck empty where it is free from the enemy, the vessel, overturned by the accumulated weight, within its hollow hull incloses both sea and sailors;
nor is it allowed them to throw out their arms in the vast deep, but they perish in the inclosed waves.
Then was a remarkable kind of dreadful death beheld, when by chance ships of opposite sides transfixed with their beaks a youth as he swam.
His breast divided in the middle at such mighty blows;
nor with the ground bones were the limbs able to prevent the brazen beaks from re-echoing.
His middle burst asunder, through his mouth the blood, mingled with the entrails, spouted forth corrupt matter.
After they backed the ships with the oars, and the beaks with­ drew, the body, with the pierced breast, being cast into the sea admitted the water into the wounds.
The greatest part of a crew being shipwrecked, strug­ gling against death with expanded arms, rushed to receive the aid of a friendly ship;
but when they caught hold of the woodwork on high with forbidden arms, and the bark, likely to perish, swayed to and fro from the multitude received, the impious crew from above struck at the middle of their arms with the sword:
leaving their arms hanging from the Grecian ship, they were slain by the hands of their own side;
no longer did the waves support on the surface of the sea the heavy trunks.
And now, all the soldiers stripped bare, the weapons being expended, fury finds arms;
one hurls an oar at the foe;
but others whirl round with stout arms the wrenched-up flag- staff 1, and the benches torn away, the rowers being driven off.
For the purposes of fighting they break up the ships.
The bodies slain they catch as they are falling overboard, and spoil the carcases of the weapons.
Many, wanting darts, draw the deadly javelin wrenched out from their own entrails, and with the left hand clench fast their wounds, so that the blood may allow a firm blow, and may start forth after hav­ ing hurled the hostile spear.
Yet upon this ocean nothing causes more destruction than the antagonist opposed to the sea.
For fire fixed to unctuous torches I, and alive, beneath a covering of sulphur, is spread about;
but the ships ready to afford a nutriment,, now with pitch, now with melted wax, spread the confla­ gration.
Nor do the waves conquer the flames;
and, the barks now scattered over the sea, the fierce fire claims the fragments for itself.
This one takes to the waves, that in the sea he may extinguish the flames;
these, that they may not be drowned, cling to.
the burning spars.
Amid a thousand forms of death, that single end is an object of dread, by which they have begun to perish.
Nor is their valour idle in shipwreck.
They collect darts thrown up by the sea, and supply them to the ships, and with failing efforts ply their erring hands through the waves.
Now if but small the supply of weapons that is afforded, they make use of the sea.
Fierce enemy clutches hold of enemy, and they delight to sink with arms entwined, and to die drowning the foe.
In that mode of fighting there was one Phocæan skilled at keeping his breath beneath the waves, and examining in the sea if anything had been, sunk in the sands, and at wrenching up the tooth of the fluke too firmly fixed, as often as the anchor had proved insensible to the tightened rope.
He took the enemy quite down when grappled with, and then, victorious, returned to the surface of the water;
but, while he believed that he was rising amid the vacant waves, he met with the ships, and at last remained for good beneath the sea.
Some threw their arms around the hostile oars, and withheld the flight of the ships.
Not to throw away their deaths was the greatest care;
many a one, dying, applied his wounds to the stern, and warded off the blows from the beaks.
Lygdamus, a slinger with the Balearic sling 2, aiming with the hurled bullet at Tyrrhenus as he stood on the lofty ele­ vation of the prow, shattered his hollow temples with the solid lead.
Expelled from their sockets, after the blood had burst all the ligaments, the eyes started forth;
his sight destroyed, he stood amazed, and thought that this was the darkness of death;
but after he found that strength existed in his limbs, he said:
“You, 0 companions, just as you are wont to direct the missiles, place me also straight in a direc­ tion for hurling darts.
Employ, Tyrrhenus, what remains of life in all the chances of war.
This carcase, when dead, in a great degree is of considerable use to the warriors;
in the place of one living shalt thou be struck by the blow."
Thus having said, with aimless hand he hurled the dart against the foe, but still not without effect.
This Argus, a youth of noble blood, received, not quite where the midriff slopes down to the loins, and falling down he aided the weapon with his own weight.
Now stood the unhappy sire of Argus in the opposite part of the conquered ship;
in the days of his youth he would not have yielded to any one in Phocæan arms:
conquered by age his strength had decayed, and, worn out with old age, he was a model of valour, not a soldier.
He, seeing the death, often stumbling, being an aged man, came between the benches of the long ship to the stern, and found the panting limbs.
No tears fell from his cheeks, lie did not beat his breast, but grew stiff all over his body with distended hands.
Night came on, and dense shades spread over his eyes, and as he looked upon him he ceased to recognize the wretched Argus.
He sinking, on seeing his father, raised his head and his now languid neck;
no voice issued from his loosened jaws;
only with his silent features did he ask a kiss and invite his father's right hand to close his eyes.
When the old man was relieved from his torpor, and his grief, caused by the bloodshed, began to gain strength, “I will not," he exclaimed, ”lose the time granted by the cruel Gods, and I will pierce my aged throat.
Argus, grant pardon to thy wretched parent, that I have fled from thy embrace, thy last kisses.
The warm blood has not yet quitted thy wounds, and but half-dead thou dost lie, and mayst still be the survivor.
"Thus having said, although he had stained the hilt of the sword driven through his entrails, still, with a headlong leap, he descended beneath the deep waves.
His life hastening to precede the end of his son he did not entrust to but one form of death.
Now do the fates of the chieftains take a turn, nor is the event of the warfare any longer doubtful:
of the Grecian fleet the greatest part is sunk;
but other ships, changing their rowers 1, carry their own conquerors;
a few with pre­ cipitate flight reach their haven.
What wailing of parents was there in the city!
What lamentations of matrons along the shore!
Often did the wife, the features being disfigured by the waves, embracing the dead body of a Roman, believe them to be the features of her husband;
and, the funeral pile being lighted, wretched parents contended for the mutilated body.
But Brutus, victorious on the deep, added to the arms of Cæsar the first honor gained on the waves.
In the meantime Cæsar arrives in Spain, where Afranius and Petreius are in command of Pompey's forces, consisting of Romans and Spaniards, 1-10.
A battle is fought at llerda, 11-47.
By reason of the rains in the spring an inundation ensues, and Cæsar's camp is overflowed, 48-90.
A famine prevails, 91-97. And then a flood, 98 - 120.
When the waters subside Petreius departs from Ilerda, 121-147.
Cæsar comes up with him, and a battle is fought, 148-156.
Caesar commands the flying enemy to be intercepted, 157-166.
Both sides pitch their camps.
The fellow-citizens recognize each other, and interchange courtesies, 167-194.
But Petreius puts an end to this good feeling, and calls his own men to arms, 195-211.
He then harangues his troops, 212-235.
The warfare is resumed, 236-253.
The Pompeian troops fly towards Ilerda, 254-263.
Cæsar shuts them out from a supply of water, 264-266.
The sufferings of the Pompeians are described, 267-336.
Afranius sues for peace, 337-362.
Which Cæsar grants to the enemy, 363-401.
In the meantime, Antony, the lieutenant of Caesar, is besieged by the adherents of Pompey on the shores of the Adriatic, and his troops are suffering from famine, 402-414.
He then attempts to escape by sea, 415-432.
Loose chains are placed by the enemy beneath the waves, which intercept the flight of one of Antony's rafts, 433-464.
Vulteius, the commander of the raft, exhorts his men to slay each other rather than fall into the hands of the enemy, 465-520.
They obey his commands, 521-581.
Curio sails for Africa, and landing at the river Bagrada, near Utica, is informed by one of the inhabitants of the contest which took place near there between Hercules and the giant Antæus, 581-660.
Varus, the Pompeian commander, is routed by Curio, 661-714.
Curio fights against Juba, but being surrounded by an am­ buscade, is destroyed with his forces, 715-798.
He is apostrophized by the Poet, 799-824.BUT afar in the remotest regions of the world stem Cæsar wages a warfare, not injurious with much slaughter 1, but destined to give the greatest impulse to the fate of the chieftains.
With equal rights, Afranius' and Petreius 3 were rulers in that camp;
an agreement divided the com­ mon command into equal shares;
and the ever-watchful guard, protector of the trenches, obeyed alternate standards.
With these, besides the Latian bands, there was the active Asturian1 and the light-armed Vettones2, and the Celts 3, who migrated from the ancient race of the Gauls, mingling their name with the Iberians.
The rich soil swells with a slight elevation, and with a hill of gentle slope increases on high;
upon this rises Ilerda 4, founded by ancient hands;
the Sicoris, not the last among the Hesperian rivers, flows by with its placid waves, which a stone bridge spans with its large arch, des­ tined to endure the wintry waters5.
But an adjoining rock bears the standard of Magnus;
nor on a smaller hill does Cæsar rear his camp;
a river in the middle divides the tents.
The earth, expanding from here, unfolds extended fields, the eye scarcely catching the limits;
and thou dost bound the plains, .impetuous Cinga6, being forbidden to repel the waves and the shores of ocean in thy course;
for, the streams being mingled, the Iberus, that gives it to the region, takes away thy name from thee.
The first day of the warfare refrained from blood-stained battle, and draw out both the strength of the chieftains and the numerous standards to be reviewed.
They were ashamed of their wickedness;
fear restrained the arms of them thus frenzied, and one day did they devote to country and the broken laws.
Then, the light of day declining 1, Cæsar by night surrounded his troops with a trench sud­ denly formed, while the front ranks kept their post2, and he deceived the foe, and, his maniples being drawn up near each other in close ranks, enveloped the camp.
At early dawn he commanded a them with a sudden move- ment to ascend a hill, which in the middle separated Ilerda in safety from the camp.
Hither did both shame and terror drive the foe, and, his troops hurried on, he first took pos­ session of the hill;
to these valour and the sword promised the spot, but to those possession of the place itself.
The loaded soldiers struggled up the steep rocks ;
and with faces upturned the ranks clung to the opposing mountain, and, likely to fall upon their backs, were elevated by the shields of those that followed.
There was opportunity for no one to poise his dart, while he was tottering and strengthening his footsteps with his javelin fixed in the ground, while they were clinging to crags and stumps of trees, and, the enemy neglected, cut their way with the sword.
The chieftain beheld the troops likely to fail with disaster, and ordered the cavalry to take part in the warfare, and by a circuit to the left1 to place before them its protected side.
Thus was the foot, readily, and with no one pressing upon it, relieved, and the disappointed conqueror, the battle being cut short, stood aloft.
Thus far were the vicissitudes of arms;
the rest of its fortunes did the weather give to the warfare, uncertain with its varying fluctuations.
The winter, clogged with the slug­ gish ice, and the dry north winds, kept the showers in the clouds, the sky being frozen up.
Snows pinched the moun­ tain districts, and hoar-frosts destined not to last on seeing the sun;
and the whole earth nearer to the sky that sinks the Constellations was parched, hardened beneath the winter's clear sky.
But after the vernal carrier of Hellel who fell off, that looks back upon the Constellations, brought back the warm Titan, and once again, the hours having been made equal according to the weights of the true Balance, the days exceeded in duration 2 ;
then, the sun left behind, at the time when Cynthia first shone dubious with her horn 3, she excluded Boreas, and received flames from Eurus4.
He, whatever clouds he finds in his own region, hurls on towards the western world with Nabathæan blasts 5 ;
both those which the Arabian feels, and the mists which the Gan­ getic land exhales, and whatever the orient sun allows to collect, whatever Corns, the darkener of the eastern sky, has carried along, whatever has defended the Indians from the heat;
the clouds removed afar from the east rendered tempestuous the day;
nor could they with their heaviness burst upon the mid region of the world, but hurried along the showers in their flight.
Arctus and Notus are free from rains;
towards Calpe alone floats the humid air.
Here, where now the lofty sky of heaven" meets with the limits of Zephyrus and the ocean, forbidden to pass beyond they roll in their dense masses, and hardly does the space that separates the earth from the heavens contain the mass of darkened air.
And now, pressed by the sky, they are thickened into dense showers, and, united together, they flow downward ;
nor do the light­ nings preserve their flames, although they flash incessantly;
the bolts are quenched by the rains.
On this side, with arch incomplete, the rainbow with its curve spans the air, varying in colour with hardly any light, and drinks of the ocean1, and carries the waves, borne away, ur to the clouds, and restores to the heavens the ocean spread beneath.
And now, the Pyrenean snows2, which Titan never was able to melt, flow down, and the rocks are wet with broken ice.
Then, the waters which spring forth from wonted channels have no passage, such an extended stream does all the bed of the river receive away beyond the banks.
Now the shipwrecked arms of Cæsar are floating in the plain, and, carried along with a vast torrent, the camp is swept away;
in the deep trench rivers overflow.
No capture of cattle is easy, no fodder do the furrows under water bear;
through mistake of the covered ways, the foragers, seat­ tered abroad, are deceived amid the fields hidden from their sight.
And now, ever the first attendant on great calamities, ravening famine comes, and, besieged by no enemy, the soldier is in want.
For a whole fortune3, one, not a prodigal, buys a little corn.
0 the pallid thirst for gain !
The gold proffered, a starving seller is not found wanting.
Now hills and elevations lie concealed;
now one continued marsh hides all the rivers, and sinks them in its vast gulf;
entirely it absorbs the rocks, and bears away the shelters of wild beasts, and carries off themselves ;
and, stronger than they, it whirls in sudden vortices the roaring waters and repulses the tides of ocean.
Nor is the night, spread over the sky, sensible that Phœbus rises;
the disfigured face of heaven and the united shades mingle the varying traces of objects.
Thus lies the remotest part of the world, which the snowy zone and perpetual winters oppress;
in the heavens no stars does it behold, not anything does it produce with its barren cold.
but with ice it moderates the fires of the Con­ stellations1 in the middle of the system.
Thus, 0 supreme Parent of the world, thus, Neptune, ruler in the second rank2 of the ocean trident, mayst thou do, and mayst thou render dense the air with perpetual showers;
do thou, Neptune, forbid to return, whatever streams thou hast sent forth.
Let not the rivers find a downward course to the sea-shore, but be beaten back by the waters of the main;
and let the shaken earth crumble into channels for the streams.
These plains let the Rhine inundate, these the Rhone;
hither let the rivers direct their vast resources.
Hither send the Rhipæan snows to thaw;
hither pour forth the pools and lakes, and, wherever they extend, the sluggish marshes, and rescue from civil wars a the wretched lands.
But the Fortune of the hero, contented with this slight alarm, returns in full career, and more than usual do the propitious Deities favour him and merit his forgiveness.
Now the air is more serene, and Phœbus, equal to the waters, has scattered the dense clouds into fleecy forms, and the nights are reddening with the approaching light;
and, the due order of things observed, moisture departs from the stars1, and whatever of the water is poised aloft seeks the lower regions.
The woods begin to raise their foliage, the hills to emerge from the standing waters, and the valleys to become hard, the light of day beheld.
And when the Sicoris re­ gains its banks and leaves the plains, in the first place the white willow, its twigs steeped in water, is woven into small boats, and covered over, the bullock being slaugh­ tered, adapted for passengers it floats along the swelling stream.
Thus does the Venetian on the flowing Padus, and on the expanded ocean the Briton sail2;
thus, when the Nile covers everything, is the Memphitic boat framed of the swampy papyrus a.
Thrown across on these vessels the army hastens on either side to curve the cut-down wood1;
and dreading the swelling of the threatening river, it does not place the wooden foundations on the edges of the banks, but extends the bridge into the midst of the fields.
And lest the Sicoris may dare anything with its waters rising once again, it is drawn away into channels, and, the stream being divided by canals, it pays the penalty for the more swollen waters.
When Petreius sees that all things proceed with fortune to Cæsar, he abandons the lofty Ilerda, and, distrusting the might of the known world, seeks nations unsubdued 2, and always fierce in arms by courting death, and he directs his course to the limits of the world.
Cæsar, beholding the hills forsaken and the camp aban­ doned, bids them take up arms, and not look for bridge or fords3, but surmount the stream with hardy arms.
Obedience is given, and the soldier, rushing to the battle, eagerly hastens on a path which in flight he would have dreaded.
Afterwards, their arms regained, they warm their soaking limbs, and, by running, reinvigorate their joints chilled by the stream, until the shadows decrease, the day speeding onwards to the noon.
And now the cavalry over takes the hindmost ranks, and, undecided for flight and for fight, they are detained.
Two rocks raise1 their craggy ridges from the plain, a hollow vale being in the midst.
On the one side the ele­ vated earth forms a chain of lofty hills, between which with darkened route safe paths lie concealed.
These straits an enemy gaining possession of, Cæsar, perceives that the warfare may be carried thence into the remote regions of the earth and into savage nations.
" Go," says he, "without keeping your ranks2, and in your speedy course turn back your hastening force, and present your faces and your threatening countenances to the battle;
and let not the cowards fall by an ignoble death;
as they fly let them receive the weapon straight in the breast.
"He spoke, and he came in front of the foe speeding on­ ward to the mountains.
There they pitched their camps a little distant from each other, with a narrow trench between.
After their eyes, straining by reason of no distance, had mutually caught sight3 of each other's countenances in full view, and they beheld their own brothers, and children, and fathers, the wickedness of civil warfare was revealed.
For a little time they held their peace through fear;
only with signs and the waving of the sword did they salute their friends.
Soon, when, with more powerful impulses, ardent affection overpowered the rules of war, the soldiers ventured to pass the trench, and to stretch the extended hands1 for an embrace.
One calls out the name of his host;
another shouts to a neighbour;
a youth spent together reminds another of their boyish pursuits;
nor is there a Roman that does not recognize an enemy as an acquaintance.
The arms are wet with tears, with sighs they interrupt their kisses;
and, although stained with no blood, the soldier dreads to have done what he might have done.
Why dost thou beat thy breast?
Why, madman, dost thou groan ?
Why dost thou pour forth empty laments, and not own that of thine own accord thou hast been obedient to criminality ?
Dost thou so greatly dread him, whom thou thyself dost make to be dreaded ?
Let the trumpet-call sound to battle, do thou neglect the ruthless signal;
let them bear on the standards, stay behind;
soon will the civic strife come to an end, and Cæsar, a private person, will love his son-in-law.
Now, Concord, do thou approach, encircling all things in thine everlasting embrace, 0 thou salvation of things and of the harmonizing world, and hal lowed love of the universe!
now does our age hold a vast in fluence on what is to come.
The skulking places of crimes so many have come to an end;
pardon is torn away from an erring people;
they have recognized their own friends.
0 Fates, the Deity thus unpropitious, that by reason of a little respite increase calamities so great!
There was a truce, and the soldiers, mingled in either camp, wandered at large ;
in friendship on the hard turf they prepared the banquets;
and with the mingled wine the libations flowed1 on the grassy hearths, and, their couches united, the tale of the wars prolonged the sleepless night:
on what plain they first came to a stand, from what right hand sped the lance.
While they are boasting of the valiant things which they have done, and while they are disagreeing on many a point, what alone the Fates are seeking, conn­ dence is renewed in them, wretched beings, and all the future criminality waxes the stronger by reason of their affection.
For after the treaty for a truce2 is known to Petreius, and he sees himself and his own camp being betrayed, he arouses the right hands of his household troops to the accursed warfare, and, surrounded with a multitude, head­ long drives the unarmed enemy from the camp, and separates them, joined in embraces, with the sword, and with plenteous bloodshed3 disturbs the peace.
Fierce anger adds words to provoke the battle :
­ " 0 soldiers, unmindful of your country, forgetful of your standards, if you cannot bestow this on the cause of the Senate, to return, its champions, Cæsar being overcome;
at least you can, to be overcome4.
While there is the sword, and the Fates are yet uncertain, and blood shall not be wanting to flow from many a wound, will you be going over to a tyrant, and will you raise standards con­ demned for treason?
And will Cæsar have to be entreated that he will make no distinction between his slaves ?
Is life also to be begged for for your generals ?
Never shall my safety be the price and the reward of abominable trea­ son ;
civil wars tend not to this, that we should live on.
"Under the name of peace we are betrayed.
Nations would not be digging iron out of the mine that retreats far within the earth, no walls would be fortifying cities, no spirited steed would be going to the wars, no fleet upon the ocean to spread its tower-bearing ships upon the deep, if liberty were ever righteously bartered in return for peace.
Oaths sworn in accursed criminality2 are to bind my enemies, forsooth!
but by you is your fidelity less es­ teemed, because it is allowed you fighting for a just cause to hope for pardon as well.
0 shocking compact of dis­ grace!
Now, Magnus, ignorant of thy lot throughout the whole world thou art levying armies, and art arousing the monarchs who possess the extremities of the world, when perhaps by our treaty safety is already basely promised thee.
"Thus he spoke, and he aroused all their feelings, and brought back the fondness for criminality.
Thus, when, unused to the woods, wild beasts have grown tame in an inclosed prison, and have laid aside their threatening countenances, and have learned to submit to man;
if a little blood comes to their burning mouths, their rage and fury return, and, reminded by the tasted gore, their jaws swell;
their anger waxes hot, and hardly does it with­ hold from the trembling keeper.
They rush on to all wickedness, and broken faith commits excesses, which, amid the dark night of battle, Fortune, to the dis grace of the Deities, might have been guilty of;
amid the tables1 and the couches2, they stab the breasts which just before they have enfolded in their embraces.
And, although at first lamenting they unsheathe their weapons, when the sword, the dissuader from right, adheres to the right hand, soon as they strike, they hate their own friends and strengthen their wavering spirits with the blow.
Now the camp waxes hot with the tumult, and with the riot of crimi­ nality ;
the necks of parents are wrenched.
And as though hidden criminality might be valueless, they expose all their monstrous deeds before the faces of their chieftains ;
they take delight in being guilty.
Thou, Cæsar, although despoiled of many a soldier, dost recognize3 the Gods of heaven as favouring thee.
Nor indeed in the Emathian' plains 4 was thy fortune greater, nor in the waves of Phocæan Massilia ;
nor were exploits so great performed in the Pharian seas;
since through this crime alone in the civil warfare thou shalt be the leader of the better cause.
Polluted by an accursed slaughter, the generals dare not entrust their troops to an adjoining camp, and again they take flight towards the walls of lofty Ilerda.
The cavalry, meeting them, cuts off all the plain, and encloses the enemy on the parched hills.
Then Cæsar strives to surround them5 destitute of water with a deep entrenchment, and not to permit the camp to reach the banks of the river, or the outworks to wind around plenteous springs.
When they beheld the road to death, their terror was turned into headlong rage.
The soldiers slew the horses, no useful aid to people blockaded;
and at length, hope raid aside, being compelled to condemn all flight, doomed to fall they are borne upon the foe.
When Cæsar saw them running down with extended front, and, devoted, making their way to certain death, he said:
­ " Soldiers, now keep back your darts, and withhold your swords from them as they rush on;
with no blood shall the victory be gained for me;
he is not conquered at no cost, who with his throat exposed challenges the foe.
See how life being hated by them, valueless to themselves, the youths rush on, now threatening to perish with loss to myself.
They will feel no wounds, they will fall on the swords, and rejoice in shedding their blood.
Let this zeal forsake their minds, let this mad fit subside.
Let them be rid of their wish to die.
"Thus did he suffer them to be inflamed to no purpose as they threatened, and, the war forbidden, to wax faint, until, Phœbus having sunk, night substituted her lights.
Then, when no opportunity was given of mingling in the fight, by degrees their fierce anger moderated, and their spirits cooled;
just as wounded breasts manifest the greatest courage while the pain and the wound is recent, and the warm blood gives an active impulse to the nerves, and the bones have not as yet cleaved to the skin;
if the victor stands con­ scious of the sword being driven home, and withholds his hands, then a cold numbness fastens on the limbs and spirit, the strength being withdrawn, after the congealed blood has contracted the dried-up wounds.
And now deprived of water, the earth first dug up, they seek hidden springs and concealed streams;
and not alone with mattocks and sturdy spades do they, dig up the fields, but with their own swords :
and a well upon the hollowed mountain is sunk as far as the surface of the watery plain.
Not so deeply down, not daylight left so far behind, does the pale searcher1 for the Asturian gold bury himself;
still, neither do any rivers resound in their hidden course, nor any new streams gush forth, on the pumice-stone being struck;
nor do the sweating caverns distil with small drops, nor is the gravel disturbed, moved upwards by the little spring.
Then, exhausted with much perspiration, the youths are drawn up above, wearied with the hard incisions in the flinty rocks.
And you, waters, in the search for you cause them to be the less able to endure 1 the parching atmosphere.
Nor do they, wearied, refresh their bodies with feasting, and, loathing food, they make hunger their resource against thirst.
If a softer soil betrays moisture, both hands squeeze the unctuous clods over their mouths.
If turbid filth is lying unmoved upon the black mud, all the soldiers vying with each other fall down for the polluted draughts, and dying, quaff the waters, which, likely to live, they would have been unwilling :
after the manner, too, of wild beasts, they dry the distended cattle, and, milk denied, the loathsome blood is sucked from the exhausted udder.
Then they wring the grass and leaves, and strip off the branches dripping with dew, and if at all they can, they squeeze juices from the crude shoots or the tender sap.0 happy they, whom the barbarian enemy, flying, has slain amid the fields with poison mingled with the springs 2!
Though, Cæsar, thou shouldst openly pour into these streams poison, and the gore of wild beasts, and the pallid aconite that grows upon the Dictæan rocks, the Roman youth, not deceived, would drink.
Their entrails are scorched by the flame, and their parched mouths are clammy, rough with scaly tongues.
Now do their veins shrink up, and, refreshed with no moisture, their ungs contract the alternating passages for the air;
and hard­ drawn sighs hurt their ulcerated palates.
Still, however, they open their mouths, and catch at the night air.
They long for the showers, by whose onward force but just now all things were inundated, and their looks are fixed upon the dry clouds.
And that the more the want of water may afflict them in their wretchedness, they are not encamped upon the scorching Meroë1 beneath the sky of the Crab, where the naked Garamantes' plough;
but, the army, en trapped between the flowing Sicoris and the rapid Iberus, looks upon the adjacent streams.
Now subdued, the generals yielded, and, arms being laid down, Afranius, the adviser to sue for peace, dragging after him his half-dead squadrons into the enemy's camp, stood suppliantly before the feet of the conqueror.
His dignity is preserved as he entreats, not beaten down by calamities, and be performs between his former good fortune and his re­ cent misfortunes all the parts of one conquered, but that one a general, and with a breast void of care he sues for pardon3:
— "
If the Fates had laid me prostrate under a degenerate enemy, there was not wanting the bold right band for hurrying on my own death;
but now the sole cause of my entreating for safety is, Cæsar, that I deem thee worthy to grant life.
By no zeal for party are we influenced;
nor have we taken up arms as foes to thy designs.
Us in fact did the civil warfare find generals;
and to our former cause was fidelity preserved so long as it could be.
The Fates we do not withstand;
the western nations we yield, the eastern ones we open unto thee, and we permit thee to feel assured of the world left behind thy back."
Nor has blood, shed upon the plains, concluded the war for thee, nor sword and wearied troops.
This alone forgive thy foes, that thou dost conquer.
And no great things are asked.
Grant repose to the wearied;
suffer us unarmed to pass the life which thou dost bestow;
consider that our troops are lying prostrate along the plains;
nor does it in­ deed befit thee to mingle with fortunate arms those con­ demned, and the captured to take part in thy triumphs;
this multitude has fulfilled its destiny.
This do we ask, that thou wilt not compel us, conquered, to conquer along with thyself.
"He spoke;
but Cæsar, readily prevailed upon, and serene in countenance, was appeased, and remitted continuance in the warfare1 and all punishment.
As soon as ever the compact for the desired peace had pleased them, the soldiers ran down to the now unguarded rivers;
they fell down along the banks, and troubled the conceded streams.
In many the long-continued draughts of water suddenly gulped not permitting the air to have a pas­ sage along the empty veins, compresses and shuts in the breath;
nor even yet does the parching plague give way;
but the craving malady, their entrails now filled with the stream, demands water for itself.
Afterwards strength returned to the nerves, and power to the men.
0 Luxury, prodigal of resources2, never content with moderate provision, and gluttony, craving for food sought for over land and sea, and thou, pride of a sump­ tuous table, learn from this with how little we have the power to prolong life, and how much it is that nature de- mands.
No wine, poured forth under a Consul gone out of memory1, refreshes them fainting;
from no gold and porcelain2 do they drink;
but from the pure water does life return.
Enough for the people is the stream and bread.
Ah, wretched they who engage in wars!
Then, leaving their arms to the victor, the soldiers, un­ harmed with spoiled breast and free from cares, are dis­ persed among their own cities.
Oh!
how much do they regret, on having obtained the granted peace, that they have ever with vibrated shoulders poised the weapon, and have endured thirst, and have in vain asked the Gods for pros­ perous battles.
To those, forsooth, who have experienced successful warfare, there still remain so many doubtful battles, so many toils throughout the world ;
should waver­ ing Fortune never make a slip in success, so often must victory be gained, blood be poured forth upon all lands, and through his fortunes so numerous Cæsar be followed.
Happy he, who was able then to know, the ruin of the world impending, in what place he was to lie3.
No battles summoned them forth in their weariness ;
no trumpet-call broke their sound slumbers.
Now do the wives, and the innocent children, and the humble dwellings, and the land their own, receive no husbandmen draughted off.
This burden as well does Fortune remove from them at ease, that tormenting party spirit is removed from their minds.
The one is the giver of their safety, the other was their leader.
Thus do they alone, in happiness, look on upon the cruel warfare with no favouring wishes.
Not the same fortune of war lasted throughout the whole earth ;
but against the side of Cæsar something did it dare, where the waves of the Adriatic sea beat against the extended Salons 2, and'the warm Jader3 flows forth towards the gentle Zephyrs.
There, trusting in the warlike race of the Curictans4, whom the land rears, flowed around by the Adriatic sea, Antony, taking up his position in that distant region, is shut up, safe from the onset5 of war, if only famine, that besieges with certainty, would with­ draw.
The earth affords no forage for feeding the horses, the yellow-haired Ceres produces no crops of corn;
the soldiers strip the plains of grass, and, the fields now shorn close, with their wretched teeth they tear the dry grass from off the turf of their encampment.
As soon as they behold their friends 1 on the shore of the opposite mainland and Basilus their leader , a new stratagem for flight across the sea is discovered.
For, not according to wont do they extend the keels and build aloft the sterns, but with an unusual shape they fasten firm planks together for supporting a massive tower.
For, on every side, empty caissons support the raft a, a series of which, fastened together, with extended chains receives alder planks laid obliquely in double rows.
Nor does it carry its oars exposed to the weapons in the open front;
but that sea which it has surrounded with the beams the oars strike, and it shows the miracle of a silent course, because it neither carries sails nor beats the dis­ covered waves.
Then the straits are watched, while the ebb­ ing tide is retreating with lessening waves, and the sands are laid bare by the sea flowing out.
And now, the waters retiring, the shores increase;
the raft, being launched, is borne gliding along on the receding tide, and its two com­ panions.
Upon them all a lofty tower is threatening above, and the decks are formidable with nodding pinnacles.
Octavius, the guardian4 of the Illyrian waves, was un- willing immediately to assault the raft, and.
withheld his swift ships, until his prey should be increased on a second passage', and invited them, rashly going on hoard, to try the deep once more through the pacific appearance of the sea.
Thus, while the hunter encloses the scared deer in the feather-foil2, as they dread the scent of the strong smelling feathers, or while he is lifting the nets on the forked sticks duly arranged, he holds the noisy mouth of the light Molossian hound3, and restrains the Spartan and the Cretan dogs;
neither is the wood permitted to any dog, except the one which, with nose pressed to the ground, scents the footsteps, and, the prey found, knows how not to bark, contented by shaking the leash 4 to point out the lair.
And no delay is there;
the masses are filled again, and, the rafts greedily sought, the island is abandoned, at the time when at nightfall the waning light now opposes the first shades of night.
But the Cilicians of Pompey with their ancient skill1 prepare to lay stratagems beneath the sea, and suffering the surface of the main to be free, suspend chains in the midst of the deep, and permit the connected links to hang loose, and fasten them to the rocks2 of the Illyrian cliffs.
Neither the first raft3 nor the one that follows is retarded ;
but the third mass sticks fast, and by a rope drawn4 follows on to the rocks.
The hollow cliffs hang over the sea, and, strange!
the mass stands, always about to fall, and with the woods overshadows the deep.
Hither did the ocean often bear ships, wrecked by the north wind, and drowned bodies, and hide them in the darkened caverns.
The sea enclosed restores the spoil;
and when the caverns have vomited forth the water, the waves of the eddying whirlpool surpass in rage the Tau­ romenian Charybdis5.
Here one mass, laden with colonists of Opitergium6, stopped short;
this the ships, unmoored from all their stations, surrounded;
others swarmed upon the rocks and the sea-shore.
Vulteius perceived7 the silent stratagems beneath the waves (he was the captain of the raft), who having in vain endeavoured to cut the chains with the sword, without any hope8 demanded the fight, un­ certain which way to turn his back, which way his breast, to the warfare.
Valour, however, in this calamity effected as much as, ensnared, it was able.
The fight was be­ tween so many thousands pouring in upon the captured raft and scarcely on the other side a complete cohort;
not long indeed, for black night concealed the dubious light, and darkness caused a truce.
Then thus with magnanimous voice did Vulteius en­ courage the cohort dismayed and dreading their approach­ ing fate:
“ Youths, free no longer than one short night, consult in this limited time for your fortunes in this ex­ tremity.
A short life remains for no one who in it has time to seek death for himself;
nor, youths, is the glory of death inferior, in running to meet approaching fate.
The period of their life to come being uncertain to all, equal is the praise of courage, both in sacrificing the years which yon have hoped for, and in cutting short the mo­ ments of your closing existence, while by your own hand you hasten your fate.
No one is compelled to wish to die.
No way for flight is open;
our fellow-citizens stand on every side bent against our throats.
Determine on death, and all fear is gone;
whatever is necessary, that same desire."
Still, we have not to fall amid the dark haze of warfare, or when armies envelope their own darts with the shades intermingling, when heaped up bodies are lying on the plain, and every death goes to the common account, and valour perishes overwhelmed.
In a ship have the Gods placed us conspicuous to our allies and to the foe.
The seas will find us witnesses, the land will find them, the island from the summit of its cliffs will present them ;
the two sides from opposite shores 1 will be spectators.
For­ tune !
an example in our deaths how great and memora­ ble thou art contemplating I know not.
Whatever me­ morials in ages past fidelity has afforded and a soldier's duty preserved by the sword, the same our youths will transcend.“
For, Cæsar, to fall upon our own swords for thee we deem to be but little;
but to us, hemmed in, no greater ones are existing, for us to give as pledges of affection so great.
An envious lot has cut off much from our praises, in that we are not em'ironed, captured together with our old men and children'.
Let the enemy know that we are men unsubdued, and dread our courage, glowing and eager for death, and be glad that2 no more rafts have stuck fast.
They will be trying to corrupt us with treaties and with a disgraced life.
0 would that, in order that our distin­ guished death might gain the greater fame, they would prof­ fer pardon, and bid us hope for safety;
that they might not, when we pierce our vitals with the warm weapon, think that we are desperate.
By great valour must we deserve, that Cfesar, a few among so many thousands being lost, may call this a loss and a calamity.“
Though the Fates should afford an egress and let us escape, I would not wish to avoid what is pressing on.
I have parted with life, companions, and am wholly im­ pelled by the longing for approaching death.
It is a frenzy.
To those alone is it granted to feel it whom now the approach of doom is influencing;
and the Gods conceal from those destined to live, in order-that they may endure to live, that it is sweet to die.
"Thus did courage arouse all the spirits of the magnani­ mous youths;
whereas, before the words of their leader, they all beheld with moistened eyes the stars of heaven, and were in dread at the turning of the Wain of the Bear, those same, when his precepts had influenced their brave minds, now longed for day.
Nor was the sky then slow to sink the stars in the main;
for the sun was occupying the Ledæan Constellations a when his light is most elevated in the Crab.
A short night was then urging the Thessalian arrows 1.
The rising day disclosed the Istrians 2 standing on the rocks, and the warlike Liburnians3 on the sea with the Grecian fleet.
The fight suspended, they first tried to conquer by a treaty, if perchance life might become more de­ sirable to those entrapped, through the very delay of death.
Life now forsworn, the devoted youths stood resolved, and, secure in fight, their deaths assured to themselves by their own hands;
and in no one of them did the outcry of the enemy shake the minds of the heroes prepared for the worst;
and at the same time, both by sea and land, few in number, they bore up against innumerable forces, so great was their confidence in death.
And when it seemed that in the warfare blood enough had flowed, their fury was turned from the enemy.
First, Vulteius himself, the commander of the float, his throat bared, now demanding death, exclaims :
— “
Is there any one of the youths whose right hand is worthy of my blood, and who, with certain assurance, can testify that with wounds from me he is ready to die?”
Having said no more, already has not one sword alone pierced his entrails.
He commends all, but him to whom he owes the first wounds, dying, he slays with a grateful stroke.
The others rush to meet each other, and the whole horrors of warfare on one side do they perpetrate.
Thus did the Dircæan band spring up from the seed sown by Cadmus 4, and fall by the wounds of its own side, a dire presage to the Theban brothers;
the earth-born ones, too, sprung on the plains of Phasis' from the wakeful teeth of the dragon, the anger being enflamed by magic charms, filled the fur­ rows so vast with kindred blood ;
and Medea herself shud­ dered at the crime 2 which she had wrought with herbs before untried.
Thus engaged to mutual destruction do the youths fall, and in the deaths of the heroes death has too great a share in the valour;
equally do they slay and fall with deadly wounds;
nor does his right hand deceive any one.
Nor are the wounds owing to the swords driven home;
the blade is run against by the breast, and with their throats they press against the hand of him who gives the wound.
When with a blood-stained fate brothers rush upon brothers, and the son upon the parent, still, with no trem­ bling right hand, with all their might they drive home the swords.
There is but one mark of duty in those who strike, not to repeat the blow.
Now, half-dead, they drag their entrails, gushing out, to the hatches, and they pour into the sea plenteous blood.
It gives them pleasure to be­ hold the scorned light of day, and with proud looks to gaze upon their conquerors, and to feel the approach of death.
Now is the raft beheld heaped up with the bloody slaughter, and the victors give the bodies to the funeral piles, the generals wondering 3 that to any one his leader can be of value so great.
Fame, spreading abroad over the whole world, has spoken with greater praises of no ship Still, after these precedents of the heroes, cowardly na­ tions will not come to a sense how far from difficult it is to escape slavery by one's own hand.
But tyrants' rule is feared by reason of the sword, and liberty is galled by cruel arms, and is ignorant that swords were given that no one might be a slave.
Death, I wish that thou wouldst refuse to withdraw the fearful from life, but that valour alone could bestow thee!
Not more inactive than this warfare was the one which at that time was raging in the Libyan fields.
For the bold Curio unmoors his ships from the shore of Lilybæum 1, and, no boisterous north wind being caught in his sails, makes for the shores between the half-buried towers of great Cartilage and Clupea2 with its well-known encamp­ ment 3 ;
and his first camp he pitches at a distance from the surging sea, where the sluggish Bagrada 4 betakes it­ self, the plougher-up of the parched sand.
Thence he repairs to the hills and the rocks eaten away on every side, which antiquity, not without reason, names the realms of Antæus5.
A rude countryman informed him, desiring to know the reasons for the ancient name, what was known to him through many ancestors.“
Earth, not as yet barren, after the Giants being born, conceived a dreadful offspring in the Libyan caves.
Nor to the Earth was Typhon so just a ground of pride, or Tityus and the fierce Briareus;
and she spared the hea­ vens, in that she did not bring forth Antæus in the Phle­ græan fields 1.
By this privilege as well did the Earth redouble the strength so vast of her offspring, in that, when they touched their parent, the limbs now exhausted were vigorous again with renewed strength.
This cavern was his abode;
they report that under the lofty rock he lay concealed, and had caught lions for his food.
For his sleep no skins of wild beasts were wont to afford a bed, no wood a couch, and lying on the bare earth he reco­ vered his strength.
The Libyans, tillers of the fields, pe­ rish;
they perish whom the sea has brought;
and his strength, for a long time not using the aid of falling, slights the gift of the Earth;
unconquered was he in strength by all, although he kept standing.
“At length the report of the blood-stained pest teas spread abroad, and invited to the Libyan shores the mag­ nanimous Alcides, who was relieving the land and sea from monsters.
He threw off the skin of the lion of Cleonæ 2 Antæus that of a Libyan lion.
The stranger besprinkled his limbs with oil, the custom of the Olympic exercises 3 observed;
the other, not entirely trusting to touching his mother with his feet, sprinkled warm sand4 as an aid to his limbs.
With many a twist they linked their hands and arms.
For long, in vain were their throats tried at by their ponderous arms, and with fixed features the head was held unmoved ;
and they wondered at having found their match."
Nor in the beginning of the contest was Alcides willing to employ his strength, and he wearied out the hero;
which his continued panting betrayed, and the cold sweat from his fatigued body.
Then his wearied neck began to shake ;
then breast to be pressed upon by breast;
then the thighs to totter, struck sideways by the hand.
Now does the victor grasp the back of the hero as it is giving way, and, his flanks squeezed up, he encircles him around the middle;
and his feet inserted, he spreads asunder his thighs, and stretches the hero with all his limbs upon the ground.
The scorching earth carries off his sweat;
with warm blood his veins are filled.
The muscles swell out, and in all the limbs he grows hard, and, his body refreshed, he loosens the Herculean grasp.
Alcides stands astounded at strength so vast;
and not so much, although he was then inexperienced, did he dread the Hydra cut asunder in the Inachian waves 1, her snakes renewed."
Equally matched they struggle, the one with strength from the earth, the other with it his own.
Never has it been allowed his unrelenting stepdame2 to be more in hopes.
She sees the limbs of the hero exhausted by sweat, and his neck parched, upon which he bore Olympus.
And when again he lays hands upon his wearied limbs, An­ tæus, not waiting for the might of the foe, falls of his own accord, and, strength received, rises more mighty.
Whatever vigour there is in the ground it is infused into his weary limbs, and with the struggling hero the earth labours."
When at last Alcides perceived the aid of the contact of his parent availing him, he said, ‛ Thou must stand, and no further shalt thou be entrusted to the ground, and thou shalt be forbidden to be laid upon the earth.
With thy compressed limbs thou shalt cling fast to my breast;
thus far, Antæus, shalt thou fall.
Thus having said he raised aloft the youth, straggling to gain the ground.
Earth was not able to infuse strength into the limbs of her dying son.
Alcides held him by the middle;
now was his breast numbed by a torpid chill;
for long he did not entrust his foe to the earth.
Hence, recording antiquity, the guardian of ancient times and the admirer of herself, has marked the land with his name.
But a more noble name1 has Scipio given to these hills, who called back the Punic foe from the Latian towers ;
for this was the encamp­ ment on the Libyan land being first reached.
Look !
you perceive the vestiges of the ancient entrenchment.
Roman victory first took possession of these plains.
"Curio, overjoyed, as though the fortune of the spot would wage the war, and preserve for himself the destinies of former commanders, pitching his unlucky tents upon the fortunate spot, indulged his camp with hopes, and took their omen away from the hills, and with unequal strength pro­ voked the warlike foes.
All Africa, which had submitted to the Roman standards, was then under the command of Varus 2;
who, though trusting in the Latian strength, still summoned from every side the forces of the king of the Libyan nation, and standards that attended their Juba3 from the extremities of the world.
Not a more extended region was there under any master.
Where the realms are the longest, on the western extremity, Atlas, in the vici­ nity of Gades, terminates them;
on the south 1, Ammon, adjacent to the Syrtes;
but where in its breadth extends the scorching track of his vast realms, it divides the Ocean2, and the bumt-up regions of the scorched zone suffice for the space that intervenes.
Races so numerous follow the camp;
the Autololes 3 and the wandering Numidians, and the Gætulian, ever ready with his uncaparisoned horse 4;
then the Moor, of the same colour as the Indian;
the needy Nasamonian5, the swift Marmaridæ 6, mingled with the scorched Garamantes, and the Mazagian 7, that will rival the arrows of the Medes, when he hurls the quivering spear;
the Massylian nation 1, too, that sitting on the bare back of the horse, with a slight wand guides the mouth unacquainted with the bit;
the African huntsman, too, who is wont to wander with his empty cot, and at the same time, since he has no confidence in his weapons, accus­ tomed to cover the infuriate lions2 with flowing garments.
Nor alone did Juba prepare arms in the cause of civil strife, but aroused, he granted war to his private resent­ ment.
Him too, in the year in which 3 he had defiled the Gods above and things human, by a tribunitial law Curio had attempted to expel from the throne of his forefathers, and to wrest Libya from its king, while, Rome, he was making a kingdom4 of thee.
He, remembering his sor­ rows, fancies that this war is the fruit of himself retaining the sceptre.
At this report, therefore, of the king approach­ ing Curio now trembles.
And because those youths have never been entirely devoted to the cause of Cresar, nor as soldiers had been tried in the waves of the Rhine, having been taken in the citadel of Corfinium 5, both unfaithful to their new leaders, and wavering to their former one, they deem either side equally right.
But after he perceives all faint with inactive dread, and the nightly guards of the trenches forsaken by desertion, thus in his agitated mind does he speak :
— "
By daring great fears are concealed;
to arms willI re­ sort the first.
Let the soldiers descend to the level plains while they are yet my own ;
rest ever produces a wavering disposition ;
remove all consideration by fight.
When the dire intent waxes strong with the sword grasped in hand, and helmets conceal their shame, who thinks of comparing the leaders, who of weighing the causes ?
The side he has taken to that does he wish well;
just as in the shows of the fatal sand1 no ancient grudge compels those brought for­ ward to combat together, but they hate those pitted against them.
"Thus having said2, in the open plains he drew up his ranks, whom the fortune of war, about to deceive him with future woes, blandly received.
For he drove Varus 3 from the field, and smote their backs exposed in disgraceful flight, until their camp prevented it.
But after the sad battle of the worsted Varus was heard of by Juba;
joyous that the glory of the warfare might be recovered by his own aid, by stealth he hurried on his troops, and by en­ joined silence retarded the report of himself approaching, fearing this alone, through want of caution to be dreaded by the enemy.
Sabura,4, next after the king among the Numidians, was sent before to provoke the commencing battle with a small troop and to draw them on, as though pretending5 that the warfare was entrusted to himself.
He himself in a hollow valley keeps back the strength of the realm;
just as the more crafty enemy 1 with his tail de­ ceives the Pliarian asps, and provokes them, enraged by a deceiving shadow;
and obliquely seizes with safe grip the head of the serpent, stretching out in vain into the air, with­ out its deadly matter;
then the venom, baulked of its purpose, is squeezed out, and its jaws overflow with the wasted poison.
To the stratagems Fortune gives success ;
and fierce, the strength of the concealed foe not surveyed, Curio com­ mands his cavalry to sally forth from the camp by night, and to spread far and wide over the unknown plains.
He himself, about the first break of dawn, commands the signal to sound in the camp, often and vainly having begged them to apprehend Libyan stratagem and the Punic warfare, always fraught with treachery.
The destiny of approaching death had delivered up the youth to the Fates, and the civil warfare urged on its author to his doom.
Over steep rocks, over crags, along an abrupt path he led his standards;
when, espied afar from the tops of the hills, the enemy, in their stratagem, gave way a little, until, the hill being left, he entrusted his extended ranks to the wide plains.
He, believing this a flight, and unacquainted with the concealed design, as though victo­ rious, led forward his forces into the midst of the fields.
Then first was the stratagem disclosed, and the flying Numidians, the mountains filled on every side, hemmed in the troops.
At the same moment the leader himself was astounded, and the multitude, doomed to perish.
The fearful sought not flight, the valiant not battle;
since not there did the charger, moved by the clangor of trumpets, shake the rocks with the beating of his hoof, working at his mouth that champs the stiffened reins, and spread his mane, and prick up his ears, and not with the varying movement of the feet did he struggle not to be at rest.
His wearied neck hangs down.
His limbs reek with sweat, and his parched mouth is clammy, his tongue hanging out;
his hoarse breast, which an incessant panting excites, groans aloud;
and the breath, hardly drawn, con­ tracts the spent flanks;
the foam, too, grows hard upon the blood-stained bits.
And now, compelled neither by whips nor goads, nor though prompted by frequent spur­ ring, do they increase their speed.
By wounds are the horses urged on.
Nor avails it any one to have cut short the delay of his horny-hoofed steed, for they have neither space nor force for the onset;
he is only carried on against the foe, and affords room for the javelins, the wound being offered.
But when first the skirmishing African sent forth his steeds in a troop, then did the plains re-echo with the sound;
and, the earth loosened, the dust enveloped the air in its clouds, and brought on the shades, as vast as it is when hurled by the Bistonian whirlwind 1.
But when the miserable fate of war befell the foot, no fortune stood in suspense upon the decision of a doubtful conflict, but death occupied the duration of the battle.
Nor yet had they the power to run straight against them, and to mingle their troops.
Thus, the youths, hemmed in on every side, by those who fight hand to band2 and by those who send them from above, are overwhelmed with lances obliquely slanting and held horizontally;
doomed to perish not by wounds or bloodshed, solely through the cloud of darts and the weight of the weapons.
Therefore, ranks so numerous are crowded into a small compass, and if any one, fearing, creeps into the middle of the troop, hardly with impunity does he turn amid the swords of his own friends;
and the mass is made more dense, inasmuch as the first rank, their feet bearing back­ wards, contract the circles.
For them compressed there is now no room for wielding their arms, and their crowded limbs are trodden on;
armed breast is broken by breast beaten against it.
The victorious Moor did not enjoy a spectacle so joyous as Fortune really presented;
he did not behold the streams of blood, and the fainting of the limbs, and the bodies as they struck the earth;
squeezed up in the crowd every carcase stood uprightLet Fortune arouse the hated ghosts of dire Carthage by these new funeral sacrifices 1;
let blood-stained Hannibal and the Punic shades receive this expiation so dire.
'
Twere profane, ye Gods of heaven, for a Roman's fall on Libyan ground to benefit Pompey and the wishes of the Senate;
rather for herself may Africa conquer us!
Curio, when he beheld his troops routed on the plain, and the dust, laid by the blood, allowed him to perceive how great the slaughter, did not endure to prolong his life amid his stricken fortunes, or to hope for flight;
and he fell amid the slaughter of his men 2, eager for death, and valiant with a bravery to which he was forced.
What now avail thee the turmoil of the Rostra and the Forum, from which, with the arts of harangue 3, the standard- bearer of the plebeians, thou didst deal arms to the people ?
What, the betrayed rights 1 of the Senate, and the son-in-law and the father-in-law enjoined to meet in battle ?
Thou liest prostrate before dire Pharsalia has brought the chieftains together, and the civil warfare has been denied thee to be­ hold.
Is it thus, forsooth, that to the wretched City you pay the penalty with your blood ?
Thus, ye powerful ones, do you atone with your throats for your warfare!
Happy Rome, indeed, and destined to possess fortunate citizens, if the care of its liberty had pleased the Gods above as much as to avenge it pleases them!
Lo, Curio, a noble corpse, covered by no tomb, is feeding the Libyan birds.
But to thee (since it will be to no pur­ pose to be silent upon those things from which their own fame repels all the lengthened age of time) we grant, 0 youth, the due praises of a life that deserved them.
Not another citizen of capacity so great did Rome produce, or to whom the laws owed more, when pursuing what was right.
Then did the corrupt age injure the City, after ambition and luxury, and the possession of wealth, so much to be dreaded, had carried along with a torrent that crossed his path his unsettled mind;
and the altered Curio became the controller of events, charmed by the spoils of the Gauls and the gold of Cæsar.
Although powerful Sulla acquired rule over our lives by the sword, and the fierce Marius, and the blood-stained Cinna, and the long line of Cæsar's house 2;
to whom was power so great ever granted?
They all bought the City, he sold it3.
In the early part of the year the Consuls convene the Senate in Epirus, 1-14.
Lentulus addresses the Senators, and advises them to appoint Pompey Commander-in-chief, which is accordingly done, 15-49.
The Poet praises the monarchs and nations who lent their aid, 50-64.
Appius goes to consult the oracle at Delphi, which has now long been silent, as to the result of the-war, 65-70.
The oracle is described, 71-120.
The Temple is opened, and Phemonoë, the Priestess, tries to dissuade Appius from his enquiries, 121-140.
She is forced, however, to ascend the oracular tripod, 141-162.
And is inspired by the prophetic frenzy.
The oracle foretells, in ambiguous terms, the death of Appius himself before the battle of Pharsalia, at the Island of Euboea, 163-197.
The oracle is apostrophized by the Poet, 198-236.
The soldiers of Caesar's party become mutinous, 237-261.
Their threats and clamours for peace, 262-296.
Caesar presents himself before them thus complaining, 297-318.
He addresses them, 319-364.
The tumult is appeased, 365-373.
Caesar sends his army to Brundisium, and orders a fleet to be collected there, 374-380.
He then repairs to Rome, where he is made Dictator and Consul, 380-384.
Evil omens give portentous signs, 384-402.
He goes thence to Brundisium;
where collecting a fleet, he orders part of his troops to embark, although the skies betoken an approaching tempest, 403-411.
He harangues his soldiers, 412-423.
The sea is suddenly becalmed, and passing over he lands at Palæste, in Epirus, 424-460.
He encamps at Dyrrhachium, 461-475.
Caesar entreats Antony to send over the remaining forces, 476-497.
Impatient at his delay, he determines to go across, 498-503.
He does so in a small boat, 504-570.
Cæsar en­ courages the mariners in a tempest, 571-593.
Which is described, 594-653.
He arrives in Italy, 654-677.
He returns to Epirus, and his soldiers expostulate with him for leaving them, 678-700.
Antony passes over with the rest of his troops, 701-721.
Pompey determines to send his wife Cornelia to Lesbos, 722-739.
He apprises her of his intentions, 740-759.
Cornelia's answer, 760-790.
She embarks, 790-801.
And sails for Lesbos, 801-815.THUS did Fortune reserve the two1 generals who had suffered the alternate wounds of warfare for the land of the Mace­ donians, mingling adversity with prosperity.
Now had the winter sprinkled the snows on Hæmus, and the daughter of Atlas who sets in the cold Olympus;
the day, too, was at hand which gives a new name to the Calendar and which is the first to worship Janus 3, who introduces the seasons.
But while the latter part still remained of their expiring sway, each Consul invited the Senators dispersed amid the duties of the warfare to Epirus.
A foreign and a lowly retreat received the Roman nobles, and a foreign senate under a distant roof heard the secrets of the state.
For who could call so many axes wielded by the laws, so many fasces 4, a camp?
The venerable order taught the people that it was not the party of Magnus, but that Magnus was their partisan.
When first silence pervaded the sorrowing assembly, Lentulus 5 from a lofty seat thus spoke :
—"
If strength exists in your minds worthy of the Latian spirit, if of your ancient blood, consider not in what land you are banished, and how far we are located from the abodes of the captured City;
but think of the aspect of your own assembly;
and, able to command everything, first, Senators, decree this, which to realms and to nations is manifest, that we are the Senate.
For whether Fortune shall lead us beneath the icy Wain of the Hyperborean Bear, or where the burning region and the clime shut up in vapours permits not the nights nor yet the days, unequal, to increase, the dominion of the world will attend us, and empire as our attendant.
When the Tarpeian seat was consumed by the torches of the Gauls, and when Camillus was dwelling at Veii 6, there was Rome.
Never by change of place has our order lost its rights."
Sorrowing abodes does Cæsar possess, and deserted houses, and silenced laws, and judgment seats shut up in sad cessation from the law.
That Senate-house beholds those Senators alone', whom from the full City it banished.
Whoever was not expelled by us from an order so mighty, is here.
Unacquainted with crimes, and at rest during a lengthened peace, the first fury of warfare dispersed us;
once again do all the members of the state return to their place.
Behold!
with all the might of the world do the Gods above recompense us for Hesperia lost;
the enemy lies overwhelmed in the Illyrian waves 2;
in the loathsome fields of Libya, Curio, a large portion of Caesar's Senate3, has fallen.
Generals, raise your standards;
urge on the course of fate;
entrust to the Gods your hopes, and let fortune give us courage as great, as the cause gave when you fled from the foe.
Our rule is closing with the finished year;
you, whose power is destined to experience no limit, Senators, consult for the common welfare, and bid Magnus be your leader.
"With joyous, applause the Senate received the name, and entrusted to Magnus his own and his country's fate.
Then honors were distributed among kings and nations that deserved them;
both Rhodes sacred to Phœbus 4 and powerful by sea, was decorated with gifts, and the unpolished youth of cold Taygetus 1.
In fame is ancient Athens praised, and for her own Massilia 2 is Phocis presented with freedom from tribute.
Then do they extol Sadales 3, and brave Cotys, and Deiotarus4 faithful in arms, and Rhasipolis 5, the ruler of a frozen region;
and, the Senate decreeing it, they bid Libya pay obedience to the sceptre-bearing Juba.
Alas, sad destinies!
behold!
Ptolemy, to thee 6, most worthy of the sway of a faithless race, the shame of Fortune and the disgrace of the Gods 7, it is permitted to bind thy pressed locks with the Pellæan diadem.
A remorseless sword, 0 boy, dost thou receive over thy people;
and would it were over thy people alone!
The palace of Lagus has been given;
to this the life of Magnus is added;
and by this a realm has been snatched away from a sister, and crime from a father-in-law.
Now, the assembly broken up, the multitude takes up arms.
When the people and the chieftains were resorting to these with uncertain chances, and with indiscriminate allotment, alone did Appius1 fear to embark upon the doubtful events of the warfare ;
and he entreated the Gods of heaven to unfold the destiny of events, and opened again the Delphic shrine of fate-foretelling Phæbus, that had been closed for many a year.
Just as far removed 2 from the western as from the eastern clime, Parnassus with its twofold summit a reaches to the skies, a mountain sacred to Phæbus and to Bromius 4;
on which, the Deities united, the Theban Bacchanals celebrate the triennial Delphic festival 5.
This peak alone, when the deluge covered the earth 6, rose aloft, and was the mid division of the sea and the stars.
Thou even, Parnassus, raised above the sea, didst scarcely lift the top of thy rocks, and as to one ridge thou didst lie concealed.
There, when her offspring ex­ tended her womb, did Pæan, the avenger of his persecuted mother, lay Python prostrate 1, with his darts till then un­ used, when Themis was occupying the sway and the tripods.
When Peean beheld that the vast chasms of the earth breathed forth divine truths, and that the ground exhaled prophetic winds3, he enshrined himself in the sacred caves, and there, become prophetic, did Apollo abide in the inmost shrines.
Which of the Gods of heaven lies here concealed?
What Deity, descended from the skies, deigns, enclosed, to inhabit the darkened caverns ?
What God of heaven puts up with the earth, preserving all the secrets of the eternal course of fate, and conscious of the future events of the world, and ready, himself, to disclose them to nations, and enduring the contact of mortals 4, both mighty and power­ ful, whether it is that he prophesies destiny, or whether it is that that becomes destiny which by prophesying he commands ?
Perhaps a large portion5 of the entire Jove, pervading the earth by him to be swayed, which sustains the globe poised in the empty air, passes forth through the Cirrhæan caves, and is attracted, in unison with the æthereal Thunderer1.
When this divine inspiration has been con­ ceived in the virgin's breast, coming in contact with the human spirit, it re-echoes, and opens the mouth of the prophetess2, just as the'Sicilian peaks undulate when the flames press upon Ætna;
or as Typhceus, buried beneath the everlasting mass of Inarime 3, roaring aloud, heats the Campanian rocks.
This Deity, however, made manifest to all and denied to none, alone denies himself to the pollution of human criminality.
Not there in silent whispers do they conceive impious wishes.
For, prophesying what is destined and to be altered for no one, he forbids mortals to wish, and, benignant to the just, full oft has he assigned an abode to those quitting entire cities, as to the Tyrians4;
he has granted to drive back the threats of war, as the sea of Sala­ mis, remembers;
he has removed the wrath of the earth 6 when barren, the end of it being shown;
he has cleared the air when generating pestilence 1.
Our age is deprived of no greater blessing of the Deities, than that the Delphic seat has become silent, since monarchs have dreaded 2 events to come, and have forbidden the Gods of heaven to speak.
Nor yet, a voice denied them, do the Cirrhæan prophetesses mourn;
and they have the benefit of the cessation of the Temple's rites.
For if the God enters any breast, a premature death is either the punishment3 of the Deity being received, or the reward;
inasmuch as under the vehemence and the fitfulness of the frenzy the human frame sinks, and the impulses of the Gods shake the frail spirit.
Thus does Appius, an enquirer into the remotest secrets of the Hesperian destiny, make application to the tripods for a length of time unmoved, and the silence of the vast rocks.
The priest, requested to open the dreaded seats, and to admit to the Gods a trembling prophetess, seizes Phemonoë 4, roving amid her wanderings around the streams of Castalia and the recesses of the groves, and compels her to burst open the doors of the Temple.
The maid inspired by Phoebus, dreading to stand within the awful threshold, by a vain stratagem attempts to wean the chieftain from his ardent longing to know the future."
Why, Roman," says she, " does an unbecoming hope of hearing the truth attract thee?
Its chasms dumb, Parnassus holds its peace, and has silenced the God;
whether it is that the spirit has forsaken these yawning clefts, and has turned its changed course towards the far regions of the world;
or whether, when Python was con­ sumed by the barbarian torch 1, the ashes entered the im­ mense caverns, and obstructed the passage for Phoebus;
or whether, by the will of the Gods, Cirrha is silent, and it is sufficient that the secrets of future fate have been entrusted to yourselves in the lines of the aged Sibyl;
or whether Paean, wont to drive the guilty from his temples, finds not in our age mouths by which to disclose the Fates.
"The deceit of the maiden is manifest, and, the Deities being denied, her very fear imparts confidence.
Then does the wreathed fillet2 bind her locks in front, and, her hair streaming down her back a white head-dress encircles with Phocæan laurel.
She, dreading the fate- foretelling recess of the deep-seated shrine, in the first part of the Temple comes to a stop, and, feigning the inspiration of the God, utters from her breast, undisturbed beneath, fictitious words, testifying a spirit moved by no divine frenzy with no murmurs of a hurried voice, and not so much about to injure the chieftain to whom she is prophesying falsely, as the tripods and the credit of Phoebus.
Her words broken with no trembling sound, her voice not sufficing to fill the space of the capacious cavern, the laurels shaken off, with no standing of her hair on end, and the summits of the Temple without vibration, the grove, too, unshaken, all these betrayed that she dreaded to yield herself to Phoebus.
Appius beheld the tripods un­ occupied, and raging, exclaimed:
­ " Impious woman, thou shalt both pay the deserved penalty to me and to the Gods of heaven, whom thou art feigning as inspiring thee, unless thou art hidden in the caverns, and, consulted upon the tumults so vast of the trembling world, dost cease, thyself, to speak.
"At length, the affrighted maiden flies for refuge to the tripods, and, led away within the vast caverns, there re­ mains, and receives the Deity in her unaccustomed breast;
who pours forth the spirit of the rock, now for so many ages unexhausted, into the prophetess;
and at length having gained the Cirrhæan breast1, never more fully did Pæan enter into the limbs of female inspired by him;
and he banishes her former mind, and throughout her whole breast bids the mortal2 give way to himself.
Frantic, she rages throughout the cave, bearing her neck possessed, and, shaking from .her upright hair both the fillets of the God and the garlands of Phcebus, through the empty space of the Temple she whirls round with her neck shaking to and fro, and throws prostrate the tripods that stand in her way as she roams along, and boils with mighty flames, enduring thee, Phæbus, raging with wrath.
Nor dost thou employ the lash alone and goads a, flames, too, dost thou bury in her entrails;
and the bridle she submits to;
nor is it permitted4 the prophetess to disclose as much as to know.
All time comes in a single mass;
and ages so many press upon her afflicted breast.
Such a vast chain of events is disclosed, and all the future struggles for the light of day;
and fates are striving that demand utterance:
not the first day, not the last of the world;
not the laws of ocean, not the number of the sands, is wanting.
Such did the Cumæan prophetess5, in the Eubcean retreat, indignant that her frenzy should be at the service of many nations, cull with proud hand the Roman from the heap of destinies so vast.
Thus does Phemonoë, filled with Phœbus, struggle, while thee, 0 Appius, consulter of the Deity hidden in the Castalian land, with difficulty she discovers, long amid fates so mighty seeking thee concealed.
Then, first the foaming frenzy flows forth about her maddened lips, and groans and loud murmurs from her gasping mouth;
then are there mournful yells in the vast caverns, and at last voices resound, the maiden now overcome :
­ " 0 Roman, thou dost escape from the vast threatenings of war, free from dangers so great;
and alone shalt thou take thy rest in the wide valley of the Eubœan quarter."
1
The rest Apollo suppresses, and stops her speech.
Ye tripods, guardians of the Fates, and ye secrets of the world, and thou, Pæan, powerful in the truth, uninformed by the Gods of heaven of no day of the future, why dost thou hesitate to reveal the latest moments of the falling state, and the slaughtered chieftains, and the deaths of poten­ tates, and nations so numerous falling amid Hesperian bloodshed ?
Is it that the Deities have not yet decreed mischief so great, and are destinies so numerous withheld, while the stars yet hesitate to doom the head of Pompey ?
Or art thou silent upon the crimes of the avenging sword 2, and the penalties of civic frenzy and tyrannies falling to the avenging Bruti 3 once again, that Fortune may fulfil her aim ?
Then, smitten by the breast of the prophetess the doors open, and, hurried on, she leaps forth from the Temple.
Her frantic fit still lasts;
and the God whom as yet she has not expelled still remains in her not having said the whole.
She still rolls her fierce eyes, and her looks wandering over the whole sky, now with timid, now stern with threatening, features;
a fiery blush tints her face and her livid cheeks, and a paleness exists, not that which is wont to be in one who fears, but inspiring fear.
Nor does her wearied heart find rest;
but, as the swelling sea after the hoarse blasts of Boreas moans, so do silent sighs relieve the prophetess.
And while from the sacred light by which she has beheld the Fates she is being brought back to the sunbeams of ordinary day, shades, intervening, come on.
Paean sends Stygian Lethe into her entrails, to snatch from her the secrets of the Gods.
Then from her breast flies the truth, and the future returns to the tripods of Phœbus, and, hardly come to herself, she falls to the ground.
Nor yet, Appins, does the nearness of death alarm thee, deceived by ambiguous responses;
but, the sway of the world being matter of uncertainty, hurried on by vain hopes thou dost prepare to found the kingdom of Eubœan Chalets.
Alas, madman!
what one of the Gods, Death excepted, can possibly grant for thee to be sensible of no crash of warfare, to be exempt from the woes so numerous of the world ?
The secret recesses of the Eubœan shore thou shalt possess, buried in a memorable tomb, where rocky Ca­ rystos 1 straitens the outlets of the sea, and where Ehamnus2 worships the Deity hostile to the proud;
where the sea boils, enclosed in its rapid tide, and the Euripus1 hurries along, with waves that change their course, the ships of Chalcis to Aulis, hostile to fleets 2.
In the meantime, the Iberians subdued, Cæsar returned, about to carry his eagles into another region;
when almost did the Gods turn aside the course so mighty of fate amid his prosperity.
For, in no warfare subdued, within the tents of his camp did the chieftain fear to lose the profit3 of his excesses;
when almost, the bands, faithful throughout so many wars, satiated with blood, at last forsook their leader:
whether it was that the trumpet-call ceas­ ing for a time from its melancholy sound, and the sword sheathed and cold, had expelled the mania for war;
or whether, while the soldier looked for greater rewards, he condemned both the cause and the leader, and even then held on sale his sword stained with crime.
Not in any danger4 was Cæsar more tried, as now, not from a firm height, but from a trembling one, he looked down on everything, and stood propped up upon a stumbling spot;
deprived of hands so many, and left almost to his own sword, he who dragged so many nations to war, was sensible that it is the sword not of the general, but of the soldier, that is unsheathed.
There was now no timid murmuring, nor yet anger con­ cealed in the secret breast;
for the cause which is wont to check doubting minds, while each is afraid of those to whom he is a cause of fear, and thinks that the injustice of tyranny oppresses himself alone, does not withhold them;
inasmuch as the daring multitude itself has laid all its fears aside.
Whatever offence is committed by many goes unpunished.
Thus they pour forth their threats :
— ,,
Let it be permitted us, Cæsar, to depart from the frantic career of crime.
By land and by sea thou dost seek a sword for these throats, and our lives, held so cheap, thou art ready to throw away upon any foe.
Gaul has snatched from thee a part of us;
Spain, with her severe wars, a part;
a part lies in Hesperia;
and the whole world over, thee being the conqueror, does the army perish.
What profits it to have poured forth our blood in the northern regions, the Rhone and the Rhine subdued?
In return for so many woes to me thou hast given civil war.
When, the Senate expelled, we captured the abodes of our country, which of mortals or which of the Gods was it allowed us to spoil?
Guilty with hands and weapons we incur every crime, pious, however, in our poverty.
What limit is sought for our arms ?"
What is enough, if Rome is too little ?
Now look upon our hoary locks and our weak hands, and behold our feeble arms.
The prime of our life is past, our years we have consumed in wars;
dismiss us, aged men, to die.
Behold our unreasonable request!
to allow us not to lay our dying limbs upon the hard turf;
not with our breath as it flies to beat against the clod1, and to seek in death the right hand that shall close our eyes 2;
to sink amid the tears of our wives, and to.
know that a pile is prepared for each.
May it be allowed us by disease to end our old age Be­ sides the sword let there be under Cæsar's rule some other death.
Why by hopes dost thou draw us on, as though ignorant for what monstrous crimes we are being trained ?
As though, indeed, we alone are not aware, amid civil war, of which treason the reward is the greatest?
Nothing has been effected by the wars, if he has not yet discovered that these hands are capable of doing everything."
Nor do right or the bonds of law forbid us to attempt this.
Amid the waves of the Rhine Cresar was my chieftain, here he is my comrade.
Those whom criminality defiles, it renders equal.
Add that, under a thankless estimator of our deserts, our valour is lost;
whatever we do is entitled for­ tune.'
Let him be aware that we are his destiny.
Though thou shouldst hope for every favour of the Gods, the soldiers enraged, Cæsar, there will be peace."
Thus having said, they began to rush to and fro throughout all the camp, and with hostile looks to demand the chief.
Thus may it be, 0 Gods of heaven!
when duty and fidelity forsake us, and it is left to place our hopes in evil ways, let discord make an end in civil war.
What chieftain could not that tumult alarm?
But Cæsar comes, accus­ tomed headlong to meet the Fates, and rejoicing to exercise his fortunes amid extreme dangers;
nor does he wait until their rage may abate:
he hastens to tempt their fury in full career.
Not to them would he have denied cities and temples to be spoiled, and the Tarpeian abode of Jove, and the ma­ trons of the Senate 1, and brides doomed to suffer disgraceful indignities.
He wishes indeed for everything to be asked of him;
he wishes the rewards of warfare to be courted;
only the recovered senses of the disobedient soldiery are feared.
Alas!
Cæsar, art thou not ashamed for wars now to prove pleasing to thyself alone that have been condemned by thy own bands ?
Shall these be weary first of bloodshed ?
Shall the law of the sword prove burdensome to them ?
Wilt thou thyself rush through all right and wrong?
Be tired at last, and learn to be able to endure existence without arms;
let it be possible for thee to put an end to criminality.
Barbarous man, why dost thou press on ?
Why now dost thou urge on the unwilling?
Civil war is flying from thee.
On a mound of turf built up he stood, intrepid in countenance, and not alarmed, deserved to be feared;
and, anger dictating, thus he spoke:
-" Him, against whom, when absent, soldiers, just now with countenance and right hands you were raging, you have, with breast bared and exposed to wounds.
Fly, if an end of the warfare pleases you, your swords left here1.
Sedition, that dares nothing bravely, proves faint hearts, and youths that meditate flight alone, and wearied with the prospering successes of their unconquered general.
Go, and leave me, with my own destinies, to the warfare;
these weapons will find hands, and, yourselves rejected, Fortune will give in return heroes as many as the weapons that shall be un­ employed.
Do the nations of Hesperia attend the flight of Magnus with a fleet so great, and shall victory give us no attending multitude, to bear off the rewards of the shortened warfare, only receiving the concluding stroke, and, the price of your labours snatched away, to attend with no wound the laurel-bearing chariot?
You, aged men, a crowd neg­ lected and destitute of blood, then the commonalty of Rome, shall behold my triumphs."
Do you suppose that the career of Cæsar can possibly feel ill results from your flight?
Just as, though all the rivers should threaten to withdraw the streams which they mingle with the deep, the sea would never decrease the more, its waters diminished, than now it swells.
Do you suppose that you have imparted any weight to me?
Never does the care of the Gods thus lower itself, that the Fates should have leisure to attend to your death and your safety.
On the move­ ments of the great do all these things attend.
Through a few does the human race exist.
Soldiers, beneath my fame the terror of the Iberian and of the native of the north, certainly, Pompey your leader, you would have fled.
Amid the arms of Cæsar Labienus was brave2;
now, a worthless runaway, with the chief whom he has preferred he wanders over land and sea.“
Nor more pleasing to me will be your fidelity, if, myself neither your foe nor your leader, you do not carry on the war.
Whoever deserts my standards, and does not deliver up his arms to Pompey's party, he never wishes to be on my side.
Undoubtedly this camp is a care to the Gods, who have been desirous only to intrust me to wars so mighty upon a change of my soldiers.
Alas!
how vast a weight does
For­ tune now remove from my shoulders, wearied with the burden ! *
It is granted me to disarm right hands that hope for everything, for which this earth does not suffice.
Now at least, for myself will I wage the war;
depart from the camp, base Quirites, deliver up my standards to men.
But the few, in whom as the prompters this madness has raged, not Cæsar, but retribution, detains here.
Fall down upon the earth, and extend your faithless heads and your necks to suffer the stroke;
and you, raw recruits, by whose strength alone my camp shall henceforth stand, be wit­ nesses of the punishment, and learn how to strike, learn how to die.
"The motionless throng trembled beneath his stern voice as he threatened;
and of one person did a force so great, able to make him a private man, stand in awe;
as though he could command the swords themselves, able to wield the weapons in spite of soldiers.
Cæsar himself is ap­ prehensive lest weapons and right hands may be denied him for this dreadful deed;
their endurance surpasses the hopes of their stern leader, and affords throats1, not swords alone.
Nothing does he fear more than to lose spirits inured to crime, and that they should be lost;
with ratifica­ tion so dire1 of the treaty is peace obtained, and, appeased by punishment, the youths return to their duty.
This force, after ten encampments2, he orders to reach Brundisium, and to call in all the shipping, which the winding Hydrus3, and the ancient Taras1, and the secret shores of Leuca 5, which the Salapian fens6 receive, and the Sipus 7, situate below the mountains;
where the fruitful Garganus8 from Apulia, winding through the Ausonian land, enters into the Adriatic waves, opposed to the Dalma­ tian Boreas and the southern breeze of Calabria.
In safety, without his soldiers, he himself repairs to trembling Rome, now taught to obey the requirements of peace1 ;
and, indulgent to the entreating people, forsooth, as Dictator2 he attains the highest honor, and, himself Consul, renders joyous the annals.
For all the expressions3 by means of which now for long we have lied to our rulers this age was the first to invent.
That in no way any legality in wielding weapons might be wanting to him, Cæsar was desirous to unite the Ausonian axes with his swords.
He added the fasces, too, to the eagles;
and, seizing the empty name of authority, stamped the sad times with a worthy mark.
For by what Consul will the Pharsalian year be better known?
The Field of Mars feigns4 the solemnity, and divides the suffrages5 of the commonalty not admitted, and cites the tribes, and to no purpose turns the votes into the urn.
Nor is it allowed to prognosticate from the heavens ;
the augur remaining deaf, it thunders, and the birds are sworn to be propitious, the ill-omened owl presenting itself.
From that time first fell a power once venerated, stripped of its rights;
only, lest time should be wanting an appellation, the Consul of the month 1 distinguishes the ages in the annals.
Besides, the Divinity who presides at Ilian Alba 2, not de­ servedly3, Latium subdued, still beholds the solemn rites, the Latin sacrifices4 performed in the flaming night.
Then he hurries on his course, and speeds across the fields which the inactive Apulian has deserted with his harrows, and has yielded up to slothful grass, quicker than both the flames of heaven and the pregnant tigress;
and, arriving at the Minoïan abodes of the winding Brundisium 5, he finds the waves pent up by the winds of winter, and the fleets alarmed by the wintry Constellation 6.
Base does it seem to the chieftain for the moments for hurrying on the war to pass in slow delay, and to be kept in harbour while the sea is open in safety, even to those who are unsuc­ cessful.
Spirits unacquainted with the sea thus does he fill with courage:
-"More constantly do the.
wintry blasts possess the heavens and the main, when they have once begun, than those which the perfidious inconstancy of the cloudy spring forbids to prevail with certainty.
No windings are there of the sea, and no shores are there to be surveyed by us, but straight onward are the waves to be cleaved, and by the aid of the north wind alone.
0 that he would bend the head of our topmost mast, and press on in his fury, and waft us to the Grecian walls, lest the partisans of Pompey should come with impelled oars from all the shore of the Phæacians 1upon our languid sails;
sever the cables which retain our conquering prows;
already are we losing3 the clouds and the raging waves.
"The first stars of the sky3, Phoebus concealing himself beneath the waves, had come forth, and the moon had now spread her shadows, when they both unmoored the ships, and the ropes unfurled the full sails;
and the sailor, the end of the yard being bent by the rope towards the left, slants the canvass to catch, the wind,and expanding the loftiest top-sail, catches the gales that might die away.
When first a slight breeze has begun to move the sails, and they swell a little, soon, returning to the mast, they fall into the midst of the ship;
and, the land left behind, the wind itself is not able to accompany the vessels which has brought them out.
The sea lies becalmed, bound by a heavy torpor.
More sluggish do the waves stand than un­ moved swamps.
So stands the motionless Bosporus' that binds the Scythian waves, when, the ice preventing, the Danube does not impel the deep, and the boundless sea is covered with ice;
whatever ships they have overtaken the waves keep fast;
and the horseman breaks through the waters not per­ vious to sails, and the wheel of the migrating Bessan 2 cleaves the Mæotis, resounding with its waves lying concealed.
Fearful is the calm of the sea, and sluggish are the stagnant pools of becalmed water on the dismal deep;
as though deserted by3 stiffened nature the seas are still, and the ocean, forgetful to observe its ancient laws, moves not with its tides, nor shudders with a ripple, nor dances beneath the reflection of the sun.
Detained, to dangers innumerable were the barks exposed.
On the one side were fleets hostile and ready to move the sluggish waves with their oars;
on the other was famine threatening to come on them blockaded by the calm on the deep.
Unwonted vows were found for unwonted fears, both to pray for the billows and the exceeding might of the winds, so long as the waves should release themselves from their torpid stagnation, and there should be a sea.
Clouds and indications of waves are there nowhere;
the sky and the sea languid, all hope of shipwreck departs 1. But, the night dispersed, the day sends forth its beams obscured by clouds, and by degrees arouses the depths of the ocean, and for the mariners sets Ceraunia in motion 2.
Then do the ships begin to be borne along, and the furrowed waves to follow the fleet, which now moving on with fair wind and tide, pierces with its anchors the sands of Palæste 3.
The region was the first to see the generals pitch their adjoining camps, which the swift Genusus 4 and which the more gentle Apsus5, surround with their banks.
The cause for the Apsus being able to carry ships is a fen, which, deceiving by its water slowly flowing, it empties.
But the Genusus, snows, now dissolved by the sun, and now dissolved by showers, render of headlong.
course;
neither wearies itself by a long course, but, the sea-shore being near, is acquainted with but very little land.
In this spot did Fortune bring together two names of a fame so great, and the hopes of the wretched world were deceived, that the chieftains might possibly, when separated by the trifling distance of a plain, condemn the criminality now brought home.
For they have the opportunity to see their coun­ tenances and to hear their voices;
and for many a year, Magnus, not personally did thy father-in-law, beloved by thee, after pledges so great 1 of blood, the birth and the death of a luckless grandson, behold thee, except upon the sands of the Nile.
A part of his forces 2 left behind compelled the mind of Cæsar, aroused for mingling in the conflict, to submit to delay in crime.
Antony was the leader, daring in all warfare, even then, in civil war, training for Leucas3.
Him delaying full oft by threats and by entreaties4 does Cræsar summon forth :
­ " 0 cause of woes so mighty to the world, why dost thou retard the Gods of heaven and the Fates ?
The rest has been effected by my speed;
Fortune demands thee as the finishing hand to the successes of the hastened war­ fare.
Does Libya, sundered with her shoaly quicksands, divide us with uncertain tides?
Have I in any way en­ trusted thy arms to an untried deep, and art thou dragged into dangers unknown ?
Sluggard, Cæsar commands thee to come, not to go.
I myself, the first, amid the foe touched upon sands in the midst of them, and under the sway of others.
Dost thou fear my camp ?
I lament that the hours of fate are wasting;
upon the winds and the waves do I expend my prayers.
Keep not those back who desire to go on the shifting deep;
if I judge aright, the youths would be willing by shipwreck even to repair to the arms of Cfesar.
Now must I employ the language of grief;
not on equal terms have we divided the world.
Cæsar and the whole Senate occupy Epirus;
thou alone dost possess Ausonia.
"After he sees that he, summoned three or four times in this language, is still delaying, as he believes that it is he himself who is wanting to the Gods, and not the Deities to him, of his accord amid the unsafe shades of night he dares to try the sea, which they, commanded, stand in fear of, having experienced that venturous deeds have prospered under a favoring Divinity;
and waves, worthy to be feared by fleets, he hopes to pass over in a little bark.
Night with its languor had now relaxed the wearied care of arms;
rest was obtained for the wretched, into whose breasts by sleep a more humble lot inspires strength.
Now was the camp silent;
now had its third hour1 brought on the second watch;
Cæsar with anxious step amid the vasty silence attempted things hardly by his servants2 to be dared;
and, all left behind, Fortune alone pleased him as his companion.
After he had gone through the tents, he passed over the bodies of the sentinels which had yielded to sleep, silently complaining that he was able3 to elude them.
He passed along the winding shore, and at the brink of the waves found a bark attached by a cable to the rocks eaten away.
Not far from thence a house, free from all cares, propped up with no stout timbers, but woven with barren rushes and the reeds of the marsh, and covered on its exposed side with a boat turned bottom upwards, sheltered the pilot and the owner of the bark.
Cæsar twice or thrice knocked with his hand at this threshold, that shook the roof.
Amyclas arose from the soft couch, which the sea-weed afforded.
“ What shipwrecked person, I wonder," said he, It repairs to my abode ?
Or whom has Fortune compelled to hope for the aid of our cottage?"
Thus having said, the tow now raised 2 from the dense heap of warm ashes, he nourished the small spark into kindled flames;
free from care of the warfare, he knew that in civil strife cottages are no prey.
0 safe the lot of a poor man's life, and his humble home!
0 gifts of the Deities not yet understood!
What temples or what cities could this befall, to be alarmed with no tumult, the hand of Cæsar knocking ?
Then, the door being opened, the chieftain says:
­ “ Look for what is greater than thy moderate wishes, and give scope to thy hopes, 0 youth.
If, obeying my com­ mands, thou dost carry me to Hesperia, no more wilt thou be owing everything to thy bark, and by thy hands dragging on a needy old age.
Hesitate not to entrust thy fate to the God who wishes to fill thy humble abode with sudden wealtli.
"Thus he says, unable to be taught to speak as a private man, though clad in a plebeian garb.
Then says the poor Amyclas, “ Many things indeed forbid me to trust the deep to-night.
For the sun did not take down into the seas ruddy clouds, and rays of one hue1;
one portion of Phœbus invited the southern gales, another, with divided, light, the northern.
Dimmed, too, and languid in the middle of his orb, he set, not dazzling the eyes that looked on him, with his weakly light.
The moon, also, did not rise, shining with slender horn, or hollowed with clear cavities in her mid orb;
nor did she describe tapering points on her straitened horn;
and with the signs of wind she was red;
besides, pallid, she bears a livid aspect, sad with her face about to sink beneath the clouds.
"But neither does the waving of the woods, nor the lashings of the sea-shore, nor the fitful dolphin, that challenges the waves 2, please me;
nor yet that the sea-gull loves the dry land;
the fact, too, that the heron ventures to fly aloft, trusting to its hovering wing;
and that, sprinkling its head with the waves, as though it would forestall the rain, the crow paces the sea-shore with infirm step.
But if the weight of great events demands, I would not hesitate to lend my aid.
Either I will touch the com­ manded shore, or, on the other hand, the seas and the winds shall deny it.
"Thus having said and unmooring his craft, he spreads the canvass to the winds;
at the motion of which, not only meteors gliding along the lofty air, as they fall, describe tracks in all quarters of the heavens;
but even the stars which are held fixed in the loftiest skies, appear to shake.
A dusky swell pervades the surface of the sea;
with many a heaving along their lengthened track the threatening waves boil up, uncertain as to the impending blasts;
the swelling seas betoken the winds conceived.
Then says the master of the quivering bark :
­ " Behold, how vast dangers the raging sea is preparing.
Whether it presages the Zephyrs, or whether the east winds, it is uncertain.
On every side the fitful waves are beating against the bark.
In the clouds and in the heavens are the southern blasts;
if we go by the murmurs of the sea, Corus is skimming along the deep.
In a storm thus mighty neither will bark nor shipwrecked person reach the Hesperian shores.
To despair of making our way, and to turn from the forbidden course, is our only safety.
Let it be allowed me to make for shore with the tossed bark, lest the nearest land should be too distant.
"Cæsar, confident that all dangers will give way for him, says, “ Despise the threats of the deep, and spread sail to the raging winds.
If, heaven prompting thee, thou dost decline Italy, myself thy prompter, seek it.
This alone is thy reasonable cause for fear, not to have known thy freight;
one whom the Deities never forsake;
of whom Fortune deserves badly then, .when after his wishes expressed she comes.
Secure in my protection, burst through the midst of the storms.
This is the labour of the heavens and of the sea, not of our bark;
that, trod by Cæsar, the freight will protect from the waves.
Nor will long duration be granted to the raging fury of the winds;
this same bark will advantage the waves.
Turn not thy hands;
avoid, with thy sails, the neighbouring shores;
believe that then thou hast gained the Calabrian port, when no other land can be granted to the ship and to our safety.
Art thou ignorant what, amid a tempest so great, is preparing?
Amid the tumult of the sea and sky, Fortune is enquiring how she shall favour me.
"No more having said, a furious whirlwind, the stern being struck, tears away the shrouds rent asunder, and brings the flapping sails upon the frail mast;
the joints overstrained, the vessel groans.
Then rush on perils gathered together from the whole universe.
First, moving the tides, Corus, thou dost raise thy head from the Atlantic Ocean ;
now, as thou dost lift it, the sea rages, and uplifts all its billows upon the rocks.
The cold Boreas meets it, and beats back the ocean, and doubtful stands the deep, un­ decided which wind to obey.
But the rage of the Scythian north wind conquers and hurls aloft the waves, and makes shallows of the sands entirely concealed.
And Boreas does not carry the waves on to the rocks, and he dashes his own seas against the billows of Corus;
and the aroused waves, even with the winds lulled, are able to meet in conflictI would surmise that the threats of Eurus were not with­ held, and that the winds of the South, black with showers, did not lie beneath the dungeons of the Æolian rocks;
that all, rushing from their wonted quarters, with violent whirl­ winds defended their own regions, and that thus the ocean remained in its place.
No small seas do they speak of as having been carried along by the gales;
the Tyrrhenian runs into the Ægean waves;
the wandering Adriatic echoes in the Ionian sea.
0 how often did that day overwhelm mountains before beaten in vain by the waves !
What lofty summits did the subdued earth permit to be overcome!
Not on that shore do waves so tremendous rise, and, rolling from another region of the earth, from the vast ocean have they come, and the waves that encircle the world speed on their monstrous billows.
Thus did the ruler of Olympus aid his wearied light­ nings against the world with his brother's trident, and the earth was added to the secondary realms of Neptune, when Tethys was unwilling to submit to any shores, content to be bounded by the skies alone.
Now as well would the mass of sea so vast have increased to the stars, if the ruler of the Gods of heaven had not kept down the waves with clouds.
That was not a night of the heavens2;
the air lay concealed infected with the paleness of the infernal abodes, and, op­ pressed with storms, was kept down, and the waves received the showers in the clouds.
Even the light so dreadful is lost, and the lightnings flash not with their brilliance, but the cloudy atmosphere obscurely divides for their flashes.
Then do the convex abodes of the Gods of heaven resound, and the lofty skies re-echo, and, the structure strained, the poles re-echo.
Nature dreads Chaos, the elements seem to have burst from their concordant repose, and night once more3 to return about to mingle the shades below with the Gods of heaven.
The sole hope of safety is, that not as yet have they perished amid ruin of the universe so great.
As far as from the Leucadian heights the calm deep is beheld below, so far do the trembling mariners look down upon the headlong sea from the summits of the waves;
and when the swelling billows gape open once again, hardly does the mast stand above the surface.
The clouds are touched by the sails, and the earth by the keel.
For the sea, in the part where it is at rest, does not conceal the sands ;
it arises in mountains, and all the waters are in waves.
Fears conquer the resources of art, and the pilot knows not which to break, to which wave to give way.
The discord of the sea comes to their aid in their dis­ tress, and billow is not able to throw over the vessel against billows;
the resisting wave supports the yielding side, and the bark rises upright amid all the winds.
They dread not the lowly Sason 1 with its shallows, nor yet the rocky shores of curving Thessaly, and the dangerous harbours of the Ambracian coast 2;
of the summits of rocky Ceraunia the sailors are in dread.
Now does Cæsar believe there to be a danger worthy of his destiny.“
Is it a labour so great," says he, “ with the Gods above to overwhelm me, whom, sitting in a little bark, they have assaulted with seas so vast ?
If the glory of my end has been granted to the deep, and I am denied to the warfare, fearlessly will I receive whatever death, ye Deities, you send me.
Although the day hurried on by the Fates should cut short my mighty exploits, things great enough have I done.
The nations of the north have I conquered;
hostile arms have I subdued with fear;
Rome has beheld Magnus second to me.
The commonalty ordered by me, I have obtained by warfare the fasces which were denied unto me.
No Roman dignity will be wanting to my titles.“
No one will know this, except thee, Fortune, who alone art conscious of my wishes, that I, although I go loaded with honors and Dictator and Consul, to the Stygian shades, die as a private person.
There is need, 0 Gods of heaven, of no funereal rites for me;
retain my mangled carcase in the midst of the waves;
let tomb and funeral pile be wanting to me, so long as I shall be always dreaded and looked for by every land.
"
Him, having thus said, a tenth wave 1, wondrous to be said, lifts with the frail bark on high;
nor again does it hurl it down from the lofty heights of the sea, but the wave bears it along, and casts it on dry land, where the narrow shore is free from rugged cliffs.
At the same moment, the land being touched, realms so many, cities so many, and his own fortune does he regain.
But not so easily did Cæsar, now returning on the fol­ lowing "day deceive his camp and his adherents, as on the occasion of his silent flight.
Thronging around their general the multitude wept, and accosted him with their lamenta­ tions and not displeasing complaints
3. “ Whither, cruel Cæsar, has thy rash valour carried thee, or to what fate abandoning us, valueless lives, didst thou give thy limbs to be scattered by the reluctant storm?
Since the existence and the safety of so many nations depend upon this life of thine, and the world so great has made thee its head, it is cruelty to wish to die.
Did no one of thy followers deserve, not to be able to be a survivor of thy fate?
When the sea was hurrying thee along, slothful slumber was in possession of our bodies.
Alas!
we are ashamed!
This was the cause of thy seeking Hesperia;
it seemed cruel to commit any one to a sea so boisterous.
The last lot of events is wont to precipitate men into doubtful dangers and the headlong perils of death.“
For one now holding the rule of the world to have entrusted himself to the sea!
Why thus greatly dost thou tempt the Deities ?
Is this favour and effort of Fortune sufficient for the crisis of the war, which has impelled thee to our sands ?
Has this service of the Deities pleased thee, not that thou shouldst be ruler of the world, not chief of the state, but fortunate in shipwreck?"
Uttering such things, the night dispersed, the day with its sunshine came upon them, and the wearied deep lulled the swelling waves, the winds permitting.
The captains also 1 in Hesperia, when they beheld the sea weary of waves, and the clearing Boreas 2 rising in the heavens to subdue the deep, unmoored the barks, which the wind and the right hands, plied with equal time, long kept mingled;
and over the wide sea, the ships keeping close together, the fleet united, just as a troop on land.
But relentless night took away from the sailors the steadiness of the breeze, and the even course of the sails, and threw the barks out of their line.
Thus,
Nile, do the cranes, about to drink of thee, the winter driving them away, leave the frozen Strymon, and at their first flight describe various figures 3 as chance directs them.
Afterwards, when the south wind prevailing more on high has impelled their spread wings, mixed indiscriminately they are crowded into confused masses, and the letter, dis­ arranged1, is destroyed by their wings scattered in all di­ rections.
When first, the day returning, a stronger breeze blew upon the ships, aroused at the rising of Phœbus, they passed by the shores of Lissus2 attempted in vain, and made for Nymphæum 3.
Already had the south wind, suc­ ceeding Boreas, made into a harbour the waves exposed4 to the north.
The arms of Cæsar being collected in strength from every side, Magnus, beholding the extreme dangers of the dreadful warfare now drawing near his own camp, determined to deposit in safety the charge of wedlock, and to conceal thee, Cornelia, removed to Lesbos1, afar from the din of cruel warfare.
Alas !
how greatly does virtuous passion prevail in well-regulated minds !
Even thee, Magnus, did love render doubtful and anxious as to the result of battles;
thy wife alone thou wast unwilling to be subject to the stroke of For­ tune, beneath which was the world and the destiny of Rome.
Now do words forsake his mind, made up, and it pleases him, putting off what is about to come, to indulge a pleasing delay, and to snatch the moment from the Fates.
Towards the close of the night, the repose of slumber banished, white Cornelia cherishes in her embrace his breast weighed down with cares, and seeks the delightful kisses of her husband who turns away;
wondering at his moistened cheeks, and smitten with a secret wound, she dares not to arraign Mag­ nus with weeping.
He, sighing, says:
­ “ Wife, dearer to me than life, not now when tired of life, but in joyous times ;
the sad day is come, and one which both too much and too little we have deferred:
now is Cæsar at hand for battle with all his might.
To war must we give way;
during which for thee Lesbos will be a safe retreat.
Forbear making trial of entreaty;
already have I denied myself2.
Thou wilt not have to endure a prolonged absence3 from me.
Events will succeed with headlong speed;
ruin hastening on, the highest interests are downward speeding.
'Tis enough to have heard of the dangers of Magnus ;
and thy love has deceived me, if thou canst be witness of the civil war.
For I am ashamed now, the line of battle drawn up, to have been enjoying tranquil slumbers together with my wife, and to arise from thy bosom, when the trumpet-call is shaking the distracted world.
"
I dread to engage Pompey in civil warfare sorrowing with no loss.
More safe meantime than nations, and more safe than every king, far and wide, and removed afar, the fortune of thy husband may not overwhelm thee with all its weight.
If the Deities shall overthrow my ranks, let the better part of me survive;
and let there be for me, if the Fates and the blood-stained victor shall overwhelm me, whither I may desire to fly.
"In her weakness hardly did she' sustain grief so great, and her senses fled from her astounded breast.
At length, with difficulty was she able to utter her sorrowing com­ plaints :
— “ Nothing, Magnus, is left me to say in complaint of the destiny of our union and of the Gods of heaven;
death does not divide our love, nor the closing torch of the sad funereal pile;
but, sent away, by a common and too vulgar lot1 am I separated from my husband.
At the approach of the foe let us sever the union of our marriage torch;
let us appease thy father-in-law.
Has,
Magnus, my fidelity been thus ex­ perienced by thee?
And dost thou believe that anything can be more safe to me than to thee?
Have we not for long depended on one lot ?
Dost thou, relentless one, com­ mand me, absent, to expose my life to lightnings and to ruin so mighty?
Does my lot seem a tranquil one to thee, to be perishing with apprehension, when even now thou art entertaining hopes ?
As I shall be reluctant to be the slave of tile wicked, still, by a ready death, I shall follow thee to the shades;
until the sad report reaches the regions removed afar, I, forsooth, shall be living, the survivor of thee."
Add this, that thou dost accustom me to my fate, and, in thy cruelty, to endure grief so great.
Pardon me con­ fessing it;
I fear to be able to endure it.
But if my prayers are realized, and I am heard by the Gods, last of all will thy wife know the result of affairs.
The rocks will be detaining me, full of anxiety, thou being already the conqueror;
and I shall be dreading the ship which may be bringing destinies so joyous.
Nor will the successes of the war, heard of by me, end my fears, when, exposed in an undefended place, I may be taken by Cæsar even in his flight.
The shores will grow famous through the exile of a famous name, and, the wife of Magnus abiding there, who will possibly be ignorant of the retreat of Mitylene' ?
This, the last thing do I entreat, if thy conquered arms shall leave thee nothing more safe than flight, when thou hast entrusted thyself to the waves, to any quarter in preference turn thy unlucky bark;
on my shores thou wilt be sought for.
"Thus saying, distractedly she leaps forth, the couch 2 abandoned, and wishes to defer her woes by no delay.
In her sweet embrace she does not endure to clasp the breast of the sorrowing Magnus, nor yet his neck;
and the last enjoy­ ment of love so prolonged passes away;
and their own sor­ rows they hasten on, and neither on withdrawing can endure to say, "farewell;
" and throughout all their lives no day has there been so sad.
For other griefs with a mind now strengthened by woes, and resolute, did they submit to.
She falls fainting in her wretchedness, and, received in the hands of her attendants, is carried down to the sands of the sea, and there prostrates herself, and clings to the very shore, and at length is borne to the ship.
Not thus unhappy3 did she leave her country and the Hesperian harbours, when the arms of ruthless Cæsar were pressing.
The faithful companion of Magnus now goes alone, the chieftain left behind, and from Pompey does she fly.
The next night that came to her was without sleep.
Then for the first time was her rest chilled and not as usual, alone iu her widowed bed, and with no husband pressing her unprotected side.
How often, overpowered with sleep, with deceived hands 1 did she embrace the empty couch, and, forgetful of her flight, seek her husband in the night!
For, although the flame 2 in silence pervaded her marrow, it pleased her not to extend her body over all the bed;
the one part of the couch3 was kept.
She was afraid of losing Pompey;
but the Gods above did not ordain things so joyous.
The hour was pressing on which was to restore Magnus to her in her wretched­ ness.

Sextus repairs to her at night, 570-588.
He addresses her, and requests her to disclose to him the future, 589-603.
She promises him that she will do so, 604-623.
A dead body is chosen for her to restore to life, and is dragged to her cave, 624-641.
The cave of Erictho is described, 642-653.
Commencing her incantations, she reproaches the attendants of Sextus, 654 660.
By her incantations and magic skill she raises the dead body to life, 667-761.
She requests it to disclose the future, 702-774.
It discloses the woes of Rome, and of the adherents of Pompey in particular, 775-820.
The body is then burned, and Sextus returns to the camp, 820-830.
AFTER the chieftains1, now nearing each other with an in­ tention of fighting, had pitched their camps on the hills, and arms were brought hand to hand, and the Gods be- held their equals, Cresar scorned to take all the towns of the Greeks, and now refused to be indebted to the Fates for any prosperous warfare except against his son-in-law.
In all his prayers he asks for the hour so fatal to the world, that is to bring everything to a crisis.
The die of destiny that is to sink the head of the one or the other alone pleases him.
Three times on the hills he draws out all his troops1 and his standards that threaten battle, testifying that he is never wanting to the downfall of Latium.
When he beholds that his son-in-law can be aroused by no alarms to battle, but confides in his close entrench­ ments, he moves his standards, and, sheltered by a path through fields o'erspread with woods, with headlong haste he marches to seize the towers of Dyrrhachium.
This march Magnus forestalls by following the sea-line, and the hill which the native Taulantian1 calls Petra he pitches upon with his camp2, and guards the walls3 of Ephyre4, defending a city safe even in its towers alone5.
No work of the ancients or bulwark erected defends this city, or human labour, liable, though it should elevate on high, to yield either to wars or to years that move everything ;
but it has fortifications able to be shaken by no iron, the nature and the locality of the spot.
For, enclosed on every side by the deep sea and by rocks that discharge the waves, it owes to a small hill that it is not an island.
Rocks terrible to ships support the walls;
and when the raging Ionian sea is raised by the boisterous south wind, the ocean shakes temples and houses, and sends its foam to their summits.
Hither did lawless hopes attract the mind of Cæsar, greedy of the warfare, that he might surround the enemy1 unawares dispersed on the vast hills, with bul­ warks of intrenchments described afar.
The ground he surveys with his eyes;
and not content with frail turf alono to construct the walls so suddenly raised, he carries across vast rocks, and stones dug up from quarries, and the houses of the Greeks, and the walls torn asunder.
A wall is built up, which not the ruthless battering-ram, nor any engine of destructive warfare, is able to throw down.
Mountains are broken down, and Cæsar draws the work on a level right through lofty hills, and he opens fosses, and disposes towered castles on the highest ridges, and with a great circuit enclosing boundaries, thickets, and woody lonesome spots, and forests and wild beasts, with a vast net he shuts them in.
Fields are not wanting, pastures are not wanting to Mag­ nus, and, surrounded by the bulwarks of Cæsar, he shifts his camp at pleasure 2.
Rivers so many rising there, and ceasing there, exhaust their course;
and that he may revisit the most distant of the works, Cæsar, wearied, abides in the midst of the fields.
Now let ancient story raise the Ilian walls3, and ascribe them to the Gods;
let the flying Parthians admire the walls of Babylon, surrounded with frail pottery1.
Lo, as much as Tigris, as much as swift Orontes surrounds 2, as much as suffices for their realms to the Assyrian nations in the eastern world, does a work, suddenly formed and hurried on amid the tumult of warfare, enclose.
There perish labours as mighty3.
Hands thus many had been able to unite Sestos to Abydos 4, and, by heaping earth into it to exclude the sea of Phryxus 5, or to sever Ephyre from the wide realms of Pelops, and to cut short for shipping0 the circumnavigation of the lengthy Malea7, or to change any spot of the world, although Nature should forbid it, for the better.
The quar­ ters of the warfare are contracted;
here is nourished blood destined to flow in all lands;
here both the Thessalian and the Libyan slaughters1 are kept in store.
The civil fury rages on a narrow slip of sand.
First indeed, on rising, the structure of the works escapes Pompey;
just as he who, safe in the fields of mid Sicily, knows not that ravening Peloris is barking2;
or as, when roaming Tethys and the Rutupian shores 3 are raging, the waves aroused escape the ears of the Caledonian Britons.
When first he beholds the earth enclosed with a vast rampart, he himself also leading forth his troops4 from secure Petra scatters them over the different hills, that he may weaken the arms of Cæsar, and extend his line, as he hems him in, with his soldiers spread far and wide;
and as much of the land enclosed in the trenches does he claim for himself, as little Aricia of the grove, consecrated to Diana of Mycene, is distant from lofty Rome1;
and the distance at which2 Tiber, gliding by Rome, descends into the sea, if it were not to wind in its course.
No trumpet-call re-echoes3, and, contrary to orders, the darts roam;
and full oft, while the arm tries the javelin, is a crime committed.
Greater anxieties deter the chieftains from engaging in arms.
Pompey care deters by reason' of the land being exhausted for affording fodder, which the horseman in his course has trodden down, and with quickened steps the horny hoof has beaten down the shoot­ ing field.
The warlike charger wearied in the fields cropped short, while the full racks are holding the sedge that has been brought 4, falls dying, requiring for his mouth fresh grass, and cuts short with faltering knees the exercises of the ring in the midst of them.
While consumption wastes their bodies and relaxes their limbs, the close atmosphere contracts the contagion of the floating pestilence in a dense cloud.
With such an exhala­ tion does Nesis1 send forth the Stygian air from its clouded rocks, and the caves of the deadly Typhon2 puff forth his rage.
Thence do the multitudes perish, and the water, more ready than the air to contract all infection, hardens the entrails with mud collecting there.
Now the blackened skin grows hard, and bursts the distended eyes:
fiery throughout the features 3, and glowing with erysipelas, the disease breaks out, and the weary head refuses to support itself.
Now more and more suddenly does destiny sweep away everything, nor do intervening diseases separate life and death, but the weakness comes on with death;
and by the multitude of the perishing is the pestilence increased, while the bodies are lying unburied, mingled with the living.
For to throw the wretched citizens outside of the tents is their burial.
Still, these woes, the sea at their backs, and the air stirred by the north winds, and the sea-shore and the ships filled with foreign harvests, relieve4.
But ranging upon the expansive hills the enemy is not distressed by pent-up air or stagnant water;
but he endures cruel famine, as though surrounded in strict siege.
The blades not as yet rising to a crop, the wretched multitude be sees falling down1 to the food of cattle, and gnawing the shrubs, and spoiling the grove of its leaves, and tearing from unknown roots2 doubtful herbs that threaten death.
Whatever they are able to soften with flames, what­ ever to pull asunder by biting, and whatever to put into their stomachs through their chafed throats, that they devour, and the soldiers tearing asunder many, a thing before this unknown to human tables, still besiege a well-fed foe.
When first, the barriers burst, it pleased Pompey to escape, and to open to :
himself all lands, he did not choose for himself the obscure hours of stealthy night, and he disdained a march stolen by'theft, the arms of his father-in-law delay­ ing;
with ruin brought upon him he sought to come forth, and, the trenches attacked, to break down the towers, and amid all his swords, and where by slaughter a way must be made.
However, a part of the entrenchment close at hand seems fit, which they call the tower of Minutius and a shrubbery rough with trees thick set conceals.
Hither, be- trayed by no dust, he speeds his band, and suddenly comes to the walls.
At the same moment so many Latian birds shine from the plain1, so many trumpets sound.
That victory might not be owing anything to the sword, fear had stricken the astounded foe.
What valour alone could effect, slain they lay, on the spot where they should be standing;
those to endure the wounds were now want­ ing, and the cloud that bore darts so many was of no avail.
Then did the hurled torches roll down pitchy fires;
then did the shaken towers nod and threaten their fall;
the bulwark groaned at the frequent blows of the oak battered against it.
Now over the heights of the lofty entrenchment had Pompey's eagles gone forth;
now was the rule of the world open to hint.
That place which not with a thousand troops together, nor with the whole force of Cæsar, Fortune had been able to take away, a single man snatched from the victors and forbade to be captured;
and, himself wielding arms, and not yet laid prostrate, he denied that Magnus was the conqueror.
Scæva was the name of the hero;
he had served in the ranks of the camp before the fierce nations of the Rhone2;
there, amid much bloodshed, promoted in the lengthened rank, he wielded the Latian vine;
ready for all daring4, and one who knew not in civil warfare how great cri­ minality is valour.
He, when, the war now left behind, he beheld his companions seeking the safety of flight, said :
­ "
Whither does an unduteous fear5 drive you and one un- known to all the arms of Cæsar ?
0 base slaves, senile beasts1, do you, without bloodshed, turn your backs upon death?
Are you not ashamed to be wanting in the heap of heroes, and to be sought in vain for the tomb among the carcases ?
Will you not, youths, through anger at least, duty set aside, come to a stand?
Out of all, through whom the enemy might sally forth, have we been chosen.
With cost of no little blood to Magnus shall this day pass.
More happily before the face of Cæsar could I seek the shades.
Him as a witness Fortune has denied;
Pompey praising me, I shall fall.
Break their weapons by opposing your breasts, and with your throats blunt the sword.
Now does the dust reach him from afar, and the sound of the ruin, and the crash has broken upon the unsuspecting ears of Cæsar.
We conquer, 0 companions;
he will come to avenge these towers while we die.
"That voice arouses fury as great as the trumpet-call, not at the first signal, inflames;
and wondering at the hero, and eager to behold, the youths follow him to know whe­ ther valour, exceeded in numbers and in position, can give anything more than death.
On the falling rampart he takes his stand, and first of all rolls down carcases from the tower full of them, and overwhelms the foes with dead bodies as they come on;
the whole of the ruins, too, afford weapons to the hero;
both wood, and heavy masses, and himself does he threaten to the foe2.
Now with stakes, now with a sturdy pole, he thrusts down opposing breasts from the walls, and with the sword he cuts off the hands that cling to the upper parts of the rampart;
heads and bones he dashes to pieces with stones, and knocks out brains use­ lessly defended by a frail construction, of another the flame sets on fire the hair and the cheeks;
their eyes burning, the fires crackle...
As soon as, the heap increasing, the carcases made the wall level with the ground, a leap brought him down and threw him upon their arms in the midst of the troops, not less nimble than that which hurries the swift leopard on the tops of the hunting spears.
Then, compressed amid the dense masses and hemmed in by all the war, whatever foe he looks upon he conquers.
And now, the ;
point of the sword of Scæva, blunted and through clotted blood, no longer sharp, bruises the smitten foe, and wounds him not 1.
The sword loses its use, and breaks limbs without a wound2.
Him does the entire mass aim at, at him do all the wea­ pons aim;
no hand is unerring, no javelin not fortunately aimed, and Fortune beholds a new r pair of combatants meeting together, an army and a man.
The stout shield resounds with frequent blows, and the compressed fragments of the hollow helmet bruise his temples;
nor does anything now protect3 his exposed vitals, except the darts that pro­ trude on the surface of his bones.
Why now, madmen, with javelins and light arrows do you waste wounds that will never attach to the vital parts ?
Let either the wild-fire4 hurled from the twisted cords over­ whelm him, or masses of vast stone torn from the walls;
let the battering-ram with its iron head, and the balista remove him from the threshold of the gate.
He stands, no frail wall for Cæsar's cause, and he withstands Pompey.
Now he no longer covers his breast with arms, and, fearing to trust his shield and to be inactive with the left hand,-or to live by his own remissness, alone he submits to the wounds so many of the warfare, and, bearing a dense thicket of darts on his breast, with now flagging steps he chooses an enemy on whom to fall.
Like was he to the monsters of the deep1.
Thus the beast of the Libyan land, thus the Libyan elephant, overwhelmed by dense arms, breaks every missile as it bounds off from his rough back, and moving his skin shakes forth the darts that stick there;
his entrails lie safe concealed within, and without blood do the darts stand in the pierced wild beast;
wounds made by arrows so many, by javelins so many, suffice not for a single death.
Behold !
afar, a Gortynian shaft is aimed against Scæva by a Dictæan hand2, which, more unerring than all expectation, descends upon his head and into the ball of the left eye.
He tears away the impediment of the weapon and the ligaments of the nerves, fearlessly plucking forth the arrow fastened in the eye-ball hanging to it, and tramples upon the weapon together with his own eye.
Not otherwise does the Pannonian she-bear3, more in­ furiate after a wound, when the Libyan has hurled the javelin retained by the slender thong4, wheel herself round upon the wound', and infuriate seek the dart she has received, and run round after the weapon as it flies together with herself2.
His fury has now destroyed his features3, with the bloody stream his face stands disfigured;
a joyous shout of the con­ querors re-echoes to the sky;
a wound beheld on Cæsar would not have caused greater joyousness to the men by reason of a little blood.
He, concealing the pangs deeply seated in his mind, with a mild air, and, fury from his features entirely removed, says:
­ " Spare me, fellow-citizens;
far hence avert the war.
Wounds now will not contribute to my death;
that requires not weapons thrust in, but rather torn away from my breast.
Lift me up, and alive remove me to the camp of Magnus;
this do for your own general;
let Screva be rather an instance of Cæsar deserted4, than of a glorious death.
"The unhappy Aulus believed these deceitful words, and did not see him holding his sword with the point upright;
and, about to bear away both the body of the prisoner and his arms, he received his lightning blade in the middle of his throat.
His valour waxed hot, and by one slaughter refreshed, he said :
­"Let him pay the penalty, whoever has hoped that Scæva is subdued;
if Magnus seeks for peace from this sword, let him, Cæsar being entreated, lower his standards.
Do you think me like yourselves, and afraid of death?
Less is the cause of Pompey and of the Senate to you, than is the love of death to me.
"At the same moment he thus says, and the dust raised on high attests that Cæsar's cohorts are at hand.
He re­ moved from Magnus the shame and the disgrace of the war, that whole troops, Scæva, had fled from thee ;
who, the war­ fare withdrawn, dost sink;
for while blood was being shed, the combat gave thee strength.
The throng of his comrades raise him as he falls, and are delighted to bear him exhausted on their shoulders ;
and they adore as it were a Divinity en­ closed in his pierced breast, and a living instance of trans­ cendent valour;
and they adorn the Gods and Mars with his naked breast, Scæva, with thy weapons;
happy in the glories of this fame 2, if the hardy Iberian, or if the Cantabrian with his small3, or the Teutonian with his long weapons4, had turned his back on thee.
Thou canst not adorn with the spoils of warfare the Temples of the Thunderer, thou canst not shout aloud in the joyous triumph1.
Wretched man, with valour how great didst thou obtain a tyrant!
Nor yet, repulsed from this part of the camp2, did Magnus rest, the war being deferred, within the entrenchments, any more than the sea is wearied, when, the east winds arousing themselves, the billows dash against the rock that breaks them, or the wave eats away the side of the lofty moun­ tain, and prepares a late ruin for itself.
On the one side, attacking the fortresses adjacent to the placid deep with the onset of a twofold warfare3 he seizes them;
and he scatters his arms far and wide, and expands his tents upon the open plain;
and the liberty of changing their ground delights them.
Thus does the Padus, swelling with full mouth, run over its shores protected with embankments, and confound whole fields ;
if anywhere the land gives way and yields, not resisting the raging volume of water, then with all its stream it passes on, and with its flood opens fields to itself unknown.
These owners the land forsakes ;
on these hus­ bandmen are additional fields bestowed, the Padus bestow­ ing the gift:
Hardly was Cæsar aware of the combat, of which a fire elevated from a look-out gave notice.
The dust now laid, he found the walls beaten down;
and when he discovered the now cold marks, as though of ancient ruin, the very quietude of the spot inflamed him, and the rest of the partisans of Pompey and their slumbers, Cæsar overcome.
He hastens to speed on even into slaughter, so long as he may disturb their joyousness.
Then does he rush, threatening, upon Torquatus1;
who not less speedily perceives2 the arms of Cæsar, than does the sailor, as the mast totters, take in all his sails against the Circeian storm3;
his troops, too, he withdraws within a more limited wall, that in a small compass he may more densely dispose his arms.
Coesar had crossed the ramparts of the outer trenches, when Magnus sent down his troops from all the hills4 above, and poured forth his ranks upon the blockaded foe.
Not thus does he who dwells in the valleys of Ætna1 dread Enceladus2, the south wind blowing, when Ætna utterly empties its caverns, and, flowing with fire, streams down upon the plains;
as do.
the soldiers of Cæsar, con­ quered by the thickening dust:
J already before the battle, and alarmed beneath a cloud of blinded fear, meet the enemy as they fly, and by their alarm rush on to destruction itself.
Then might all the blood have been shed4 for the civil war­ fare, even to the procuring of peace;
the chieftain himself restrained the raging swords.
Happy and free, Rome, under thy laws, mightst thou be, and thy own mistress, if on that occasion a Sulla had conquered for thee1.
We lament, alas!
and ever shall lament, that the greatest of thy crimes is successful for thee, to have fought with a duteous son-in-law.
0 sad fate !
Then Libya would not have bewailed the slaughter of Utica, and Spain of Munda, nor would the Nile, polluted with shameful bloody have borne along a carcase more noble than the Pharian king;
nor would the naked Juba 3 have pressed the Marmaric sands, and Scipio appeased the ghosts4 of the Carthaginians by pouring forth his blood;
nor would life 5 have been deprived of the hallowed Cato.
This might, Rome, have been the last day of woe to thee;
Pharsalia might have been wrested from the midst of the Fates.
The spot occupied against the will of the Divinities Cæsar forsakes, and with his mangled troops seeks the Emathian lands.
His followers, by their exhortations, attempt to dissuade Magnus, about to pursue6 the arms of his father-in-law, wherever he may fly;
that he may repair to his native land and Ausonia now free from the enemy."
Never," said he, .. will I, after the example of Ciesar, betake myself again to my country, and never shall Rome behold me, except returning, my forces dismissed.
Hes­ peria
I was able, the war commencing, to hold, if I had been willing to entrust my troops in the temples of my country, and to fight in the midst of the Forum.
So long as I could withdraw the war, I would march on to the extreme regions of the Scythian frosts, and the burning tracks.
Victorious, shall I, Rome, deprive thee of repose, who, that battles might not exhaust thee, took to flight?
Oh!
rather, that thou mayst suffer nothing in this warfare, may Cæsar deem thee to be his own.
"Thus having said, he turns his course towards the rising of Phœbus, and, passing over trackless regions of the earth, where Candavia1 opens her vast forest ranges, he reaches Emathia, which the Fates destined for the warfare.
The mountain rock of Ossa2 bounds
Thessaly, on the side on which Titan in the hours of winter brings in the day.
When the summer with its higher rising brings Phœbus to the zenith of the sky, Pelion opposes his shadow to the rising rays 3.
But the midday fires of heaven and the solstitial head of the raging Lion the woody Othrys averts.
Pindus receives the opposing Zephyrs and Iapyx4, and, evening hastening on, cuts short the light.
The dweller, too, on Olympus, not dreading Boreas, is unacquainted throughout all his nights with shining Arctos.
Between these mountains, which slope downwards with a valley between, formerly the fields lay concealed amid marshes extending far and wide, while the plains retained the rivers, and Tempo, affording a passage1 through, gave no outlet to the sea;
and their course was as they filled a single standing water to increase it.
After that, by the hand of Hercules, the vast'Ossa was divided from Olympus, and Nereus was sensible of 2 the onward rush of thewater thus sudden;
better destined to remain beneath 3 the waves, Ema­ thian Pharsalus, the kingdom of the sea-descended Achilles 4 rose forth, and Phylace 5 that touched with the first ship the Rhœtean shores 6, and Pteleus 7, and Dorion lamentings8 the wrath of the Pierides;
Trachyn 1, and Melibœa2, brave with the quiver of Hercules, the reward of the direful torch3;
and once-powerful Larissa 4;
where they now plough over Argos once renowned 5;
where story speaks of ancient Thebes of Echion 6;
where once the exiled Agave bearing the head and neck of Pentheus committed them to the closing fire, complaining that this alone of her son she had recovered 7.
The marsh then, burst asunder, divided into numerous streams.
On the west Æas thence flows 8 clear into the -Ionian sea, but with a small stream ;
nor stronger with his waves does the father of ravished Isis9 flow, and, (Eneus, he, almost thy son-in-lawl covers the Echinades2 with mud from his turbid waves 3;

and with pure stream Amphrysus waters the pastures 7 where Phoebus served as shepherd;
Anauros, too 1, who neither breathes forth damp fogs, nor air mois­ tened with dew, nor light breezes;
and whatever stream of itself not known presents its waves in the Peneus2 to the ocean;
with violent flood flows the Apidanus 3 ;
and the Enipeus 4 never swift unless mingled. , r .Asopus takes his course.3, and Phœnix,, and.

Alone does Titaresos7, where he comes into a stream of an­ other name, keep distinct his waters, and, gliding from above, uses the stream of Peneus as though dry fields.
The re­ port is that this river flows from the Stygian marshes, and that, mindful of his rise, he is unwilling to endure the contact of an ignoble stream, and preserves the vene­ ration of the Gods for himself 1.
As soon as the fields were open to the rivers sent forth, the rich furrow divided beneath the Bœbycian ploughshare 2;
then, pressed by the right hand of the Lelegians,3 the plough sank deep.
The Æolian4 and Dolopian husbandmen5 cleared the ground, both the Magnetes 6, a nation known by their horses, and the Minyæ 7, by their oars.
There did the pregnant cloud pour forth in the Pelethronian caverns 8, the Centaurs sprung from Ixion, half beasts;
thee, Monychus', breaking the rugged rocks of Pholoë 2, and thee, fierce Rhœtus3, hurling beneath the heights of Œta the mountain ashes, which hardly Boreas could tear up;

and thee, treacherous ferryman5 over the river, destined to feel the arrows tipped with Lernæan venom, and thee, aged Chiron 6, who, shining with thy cold Constellation, dost drive away the greater Scorpion with the Htemonian bow.
In this land first shone the seeds of fierce warfare.
From the rocks, struck with the trident, first did the Thessalian.
charger', an omen of direful wars, spring forth;
first did he champ the steel and the bit2, and foam at the un­ wonted reins of the Lapithan subduer from the Pagasæan shored
The first ship cleaving the ocean, exposed earth- born man upon the unknown waves.
Itonus, the ruler4 of the Thessalian land, was the first to hammer masses of heated metal into form, and to melt silver with the flames and stamp gold into coin, and liquefy copper in immense furnaces.
There was it first granted to number riches, a thing which has urged on nations to accursed arms.
Hence did Python, that most huge serpent, descend, and glide along the fields of Cyrrha;
whence, too, the Thessalian laurels come to the Pythian games 6.
Hence the impious Aloeus7 sent forth his progeny against the Gods of heaven, when Pelion raised itself almost to the lofty stars, and Ossa, meeting the constellations, impeded their course.
When upon this land the chieftains have pitched the camps destined by the Fates, their minds, presaging the future warfare, engage all, and it is clear that the momentous hour of the great crisis is drawing nigh.
Because their fates are now close approaching, degenerate minds tremble, and ponder on the worst.
A few, courage preferred, feel both hopes and fears as to the event.
But mingled with the timid multitude is Sextus1, an offspring unworthy of Magnus for a parent, who afterwards, roving, an exile, on the Scyllæan waves, a Sicilian pirate, polluted his triumphs on the deep, who, fear spurring him on to know before­ hand the events of fate, both impatient of delay and faint­ hearted about all things to come, consults not the tripods of Delos, not the Pythian caves, nor does he choose to enquire what sounds Dodona, the nourisher on the first fruits2, sends forth from the brass of Jove3, who from the entrails can reveal the fates4, who can explain the birds, who can ob- serve the lightnings of heaven and search the stars with Assyrian care, or if there is any method, secret, but lawfulHe had gained a knowledge of2 the secrets of the ruthless magicians detested by the Gods above, and the altars sad with dreadful sacrifices, and the aid of the shades below and of Pluto ;
and to him, wretched man, it seemed clear that the Gods of heaven knew too little a.
The vain and direful frenzy the very locality promotes, and, adjoining to the camp, the cities of the Hremonian women, whom no power over any prodigy that has been invented can surpass, whose art is each thing that is not believed.
Moreover, the Thessalian land produces on its crags both noxious herbs, and rocks that are sensible to the magicians as they chaunt their deadly secrets.
There spring up many things destined to offer violence to the Deities4 ;
and the Colchian stranger gathers 5 in the Hæmonian lands those herbs which she has not brought.
The impious charms of the accursed nation turn the ears of the inhabitants of heaven that are deaf to peoples so numerous, to nations so many.
That voice alone goes forth amid the recesses of the heavens, and bears the strin­ gent words to tho unwilling Deities, from which the care of the skies and of the floating heavens never calls them away.
When the accursed murmur has reached the stars, then, although Babylon of Perseus and mysterious Mem­ phis should open all the shrines of the ancient Magi, the Thessalian witch to foreign altars draws away the Gods of heaven.
Through the charms of the Thessalian witches a love not induced by the Fates has entered into hardened hearts;
and stem old men have burned with illicit flames.
And not only do noxious potions avail;
or when they withdraw the pledges swelling with its juices from the forehead of the mother about to show her affection2.
The mind, polluted by no corruption of imbibed poison, perishes by force of spells3.
Those whom no unison of the bed jointly occu­ pied binds together, and influence of alluring beauty, they attract by the magic whirling of the twisted threads \
The courses of things are stayed, and, retarded by length­ ened night, the day stops short.
The sky obeys not the laws of nature;
and on hearing the spells the headlong world is benumbed;
Jupiter, too, urging them on, is astounded that the poles of heaven do not go on, impelled by the rapid axles.
At another time, they fill all places with showers, and, while the sun is hot, bring down the clouds;
the heavens thunder, too, Jupiter not knowing it.
By those same words, with hair hanging loose, have they scattered abroad far and wide soaking clouds and showers.
The winds ceasing, the sea has swelled;
again, forbidden to be sensible of the storms, the south wind provoking it, it has held its peace;
and bearing along the ship the sails have swelled against the wind.
From the steep rock has the torrent hung sus­ pended ;
and the river has run not in the direction in which it was descending.
The summer has not raised the Nile;
in a straight line the Mæander has urged on his waters;
and the Arar has impelled headlong2 the delaying Rhone;
their tops lowered, mountains have levelled their ridges.
Olympus has looked upwards a to the clouds, and with no sun the Scythian snows have thawed, while the winter was freezing.
Impelled by the stars, the shores protected, the charms of the Hæmonian witches have driven Tethys back'.
The earth, too, has shaken the axle of her lID.
moved weight, and, inclining with the effort, has oscillated in her mid regions2.
The weight of a mass so vast smitten by their voice, has gaped open, and has afforded a pros. pect through it of the surrounding heavens..
Every animal powerful for death, and produced to do injury, both fears the Hæmonian arts and supplies them with its deadly qua­ lities.
Them do the ravening tigers and the magnani­ mous wrath of the lions fawn upon with gentle mouth;
for them does the serpent unfold his cold coils, and is ex­ tended in the frosty field.
The knots of the vipers unite, their bodies cut asunder;
and the snake dies, breathed upon by human poison.
What failing is this of the Gods of heaven in following after enchantments and herbs, and what this fear of disre­ garding them ?
Of what compact do the bonds keep the Deities thus bound ?
Is it obligatory, or does it please them to obey ?
For an unknown piety only do the witches deserve this, or by secret threats do they prevail ?
Have they this power against all the Gods of heaven, or do these imperious charms sway but a certain Deity 3, who, whatever he himself is compelled, can compel the world, to do ?
There, too, for the first time were the stars brought down from the head­ long sky;
and serene Phcebe, beset by the dire influences of their words, grew pale and burned with dusky and earthy fires, not otherwise than if the earth hindered her from the reflection of her brother, and interposed its shade between the celestial flames;
and, arrested by spells, she endures labours so great, until, more nigh, she sends her foam1 upon the herbs situate beneath.
These rites of criminality, these spells of the direful race, the wild Erictho2 has condemned as being of piety too extreme, and has applied the polluted art to new cere­ monies.
For to her it is not permitted to place her deadly head within a roof or a home in the city;
and she haunts the deserted piles, and, the ghosts expelled, takes pos­ session of the tombs, pleasing to the Gods of Erebus.
To hear the counsels of the dead, to know the Stygian abodes and the secrets of the concealed Pluto, not the Gods above, not a life on earth, forbids.
Leanness has possession of the features of the bag, foul with filthiness, and, unknown to a clear sky, her dreadful visage, laden with uncombed locks, is beset with Stygian paleness.
If showers and black clouds obscure the stars, then does the Thessalian witch stalk forth from the spoiled piles, and try to arrest the lightnings of the night.
The seeds she treads on of the fruitful corn she burns up, and by her breathing makes air noxious that was not deadly.
before.
She neither prays to the Gods of heaven, nor with suppliant prayer calls the Deity to her aid, nor does she know of the propitiating entrails;
upon the altars she de­ lights to place funereal flames, and frankincense which she has carried off from the lighted pile a.
Her voice now first heard as she demands, the Gods of heaven accede to all the wickedness, and dread to hear a second address.
Souls that live, and still rule their respect­ ive limbs, she buries in the tomb ;
and death reluctantly creeps on upon those who owe lengthened years to the Fates;
the funeral procession turning back, the dead bodies she rescues from the tomb;
corpses fly from death.
The smoking ashes of the young and the burning bones she snatches from the midst of the piles, and the very torch which the parents have held1;
the fragments, too, of the funereal bicr2 that fly about in the black smoke, and the flowing robes does she collect amid the ashes, and the em­ bers that smell of the limbs.
But when corpses are kept within stone3, from which the moisture within is taken away, and, the corruption with­ drawn, the marrow has grown hard;
then does she greedily raven upon all the limbs, and bury her hands in the eyes, and delight to scoop out the dried-up balls4, and gnaw the pallid nails:
of the shrunken hand;
with her mouth she tears asunder the halter6 and the murderous knots ;
the bodies as they hang she gnaws, and scrapes the crosses7;
the entrails, too, smitten by the showers she rends asunder, and the parched marrow, the sun's heat admitted thereto.
Iron fastened into the hands8, and the black corruption of the filthy matter that distils upon the limbs, and the slime that has collected, she bears off, and hangs to the bodies, as the sinews hold fast her bite.
Whatever carcase, too, is lying upon the bare ground, before the beasts and the birds of the air does she sit;
nor does she wish to separate the joints with iron and with her hands, and about to tear the limbs from their parched jaws, she awaits the bites of the wolves.
Nor do her hands re­ frain from murder, if she requires the life-blood, which is the first to spring1 from the divided throat.
Nor does she shun slaughter, if her rites demand living gore, and her funereal tables demand the quivering entrails.
So, through the wounds of the womb, not the way in which nature invites, is the embryo torn out, about to be placed upon the glow­ ing altars.
And as often as she has need of grim and stal­ wart shades, she herself makes the ghosts;
every kind of death among mankind is in her employ.
She from the youthful body tears the down of the cheek;
she with her left hand from the dying stripling cuts off the hair.
Full often, too, at her kinsman's pile has the dire Thessalian witch brooded over the dear limbs, and imprinting kisses, has both cut off the head, and torn away the cheeks pressed with her teeth, and biting off the end of the tongue as it cleaves to the dried throat, has poured forth murmurs into the cold lips, and has dispatched accursed secrets to the Stygian shades.
When the rumours of the spot brought her to the notice of Pompey3, amid the depths of the night of the sky, at the time when Titan is bringing the midday beneath our earth, along the deserted fields he takes his way.
The faithful and wonted attendants upon his crimes, wandering amid the ruined tombs and graves, beheld her afar, sitting upon a lofty crag, where Hæmus, sloping down, extends the Pharsalian ridges.
She was conning over spells unknown to the ma­ gicians and the Gods of magic, and was trying charms for unwonted purposes.
For, fearing lest the shifting warfare might remove to another region, and the Emathian land be deprived of slaughter so vast, the sorceress has for­ bidden Philippi1, polluted with spells and sprinkled with dreadful potions, to transfer the combats, about to claim so many deaths as her own, and to enjoy the blood of the world;
she hopes to maim the corpses of slaughtered mo­ narchs2, and to turn to herself the ashes of the Hesperian race, and the bones of nobles, and to obtain ghosts so mighty.
This is her pursuit, and her sole study, what she is to tear away from the corpse of Magnus when exposed, what limbs of Coesar she is to brood over.
Her does the degenerate offspring of Pompey first address :
­ " 0 thou honor to the Hæmonian females, who art able to reveal their fates to nations, and who art able to turn them away from their course when about to come to pass, I pray thee that it may be permitted me to know the assured end which the fortune of war provides.
Not the lowest portion am I of the Roman multitude;
the most renowned offspring of Magnus, either ruler of the world, or heir to a fall so great3.
Smitten with doubts, my mind is in alarm, and again is prepared to endure the fears that spring from certainty.
This power do thou withdraw from events, that they may not rush on sudden and unseen;
either extort it from the Deities, or do thou spare the Gods, and force the truth from the shades below.
Unlock the Elysian abodes, and Death herself, called forth4, compel to confess to thee whom of us it is that she demands.
Not mean is the task;
it is worthy for even thee to have a care to seek which way inclines the hazard of destinies so mighty.
"The impious Thessalian witch rejoices at the mention of her fame thus spread abroad, and answers on the other hand :
­ " 0 youth, if thou wouldst have influenced more humble destinies, it had been easy to force the reluctant Gods to any action thou mightst wish.
To my skill it is granted, when with their beams the constellations have urged on death, to interpose delays1;
and although every star would make a man aged, by drugs do we cut short his years in the midst.
But together does the chain of causes work down­ ward from the first origin of the world, and all the fates are struggling, if thou shouldst wish to change anything, and the human race stands subject to a single blow;
then do we, the Thessalian throng, confess, Fortune has the greater might.
But if thou art content to learn the events before­ hand, paths easy and manifold will lie open to truth;
earth, and sky, and Chaos, and seas, and plains, and the rocks of Rhodope, will converse with us.
But it is easy, since there is a supply so vast of recent deaths, to raise a single body from the Emathian plains, that, with a clear voice, the lips of a corpse just dead and warm may utter their sounds, and no dismal ghost, the limbs scorched by the sun, may send forth indistinct screechings.
"Thus she says ;
and, the shades of night redoubled by her art, wrapped as to her direful head in a turbid cloud, she wanders amid the bodies of the slain, exposed, sepulchres being denied.
Forthwith the wolves take to flight, their talons loosened, the birds fly unfed, while the Thessalian witch selects her prophet, and, examining the marrow cold in death.
finds the fibres of the stiffened lungs standing without a wound3, and in the dead body seeks a voice.
Now stand in doubt destinies full many of men who have been slain, which one she is to choose to recall to the world above.
If she had attempted to raise whole armies from the plains, and to restore them to the war, the laws of Erebus would have yielded, and a people dragged forth by the powerful miscreant from Stygian Avernus, would have mingled in fight.
A body selected at length with pierced throat she takes, and, a hook being inserted with funereal ropes, the wretched carcase is dragged over rocks, over stones, destined to live once again 1;
and beneath the lofty crags of the hollowed mountain, which the dire Erictho has destined for her rites, it is placed.
Downward sloping, not far from the black caverns of Pluto, the ground precipitately descends, which a wood covers, pale with its drooping foliage, and with no lofty tops looking upwards to the heavens, and a yew-tree shades, not pervious to the sun.
Within is squalid dark­ ness, and mouldiness pallid within the caves amid the lengthened gloom;
never, unless produced by charms, does it receive the light.
Not within the jaws of Tænarus2, the baleful limit of the hidden world, and of our own, does the air settle thus stagnant;
whither the sovereigns of Tartarus would not fear3 to send forth the shades.
For although the Thessalian witch uses violence against des­ tiny, it is matter of doubt whether she beholds the Stygian ghosts because she has dragged them thither4, or whether because she has descended to Tartarus.
A dress, of various colours and fury-like with varied garb, is put on by her;
and her locks removed, her fea­ tures are revealed, and, bristling, with wreaths of vipers her hair is fastened round.
When she perceives the youth's attendants alarmed, and himself trembling, and, casting down his eyes with looks struck with horror, she says :
­ “
Banish the fears conceived in your timid mind;
now anew, now in its genuine form shall life be restored, that even tremblers may endure to hear him speak.
But if I can show the Stygian lakes1, and the shores that resound with flames;
if, I being present, the Eumenides2 can be beheld, and Cerberus shaking his necks shaggy with ser­ pents, and the Giants chained with their hands to their backs, what dread is there, cowards, to behold the fright­ ened ghosts ?
"Then in the first place does she fill his breast, opened by fresh wounds, with reeking blood, and she bathes his marrow with gore, and plentifully supplies venom from the moon3.
Here is mingled whatever, by a monstrous generation, nature has produced.
Not the foam of dogs to which water is an object of dread, not the entrails of the lynx, not the excrescence 5 of the direful hyæna is wanting, and the marrow of the stag that has fed upon serpents6 ;
not the sucking fish, that holds back the ship1 in the midst of the waves, while the eastern breeze stretches the rigging;
the eyes of dragons, too2, and the stones that re­ sound a, warmed beneath the brooding bird;
not the winged serpent4 of the Arabians, and the viper produced in the Red Sea, the guardian of the precious shell5;
or the slough of the homed serpent6 of Libya that still survives;
or the ashes of the Phoenix, laid upon an eastern altar.
With this, after she has mingled abominations, vile, and possessing no names1, she added leaves steeped in accursed spells, and herbs upon which, when shooting up, her direful mouth had spat, and whatever poisons she her­ self gave unto the world;
then, a voice, more potent than all drugs to charm the Gods of Lethe, first poured forth its murmurs, discordant, and differing much from the human tongue.
The bark of dogs has she, and the howling of wolves;
she sends forth the voice in which the scared owl, in which the screech of the night, complain, in which wild beasts shriek and yell, in which the serpent hisses, and the wailing of the waves dashed upon the rocks;
the sounds, too, of the woods, and the thunders of the bursting cloud.
Of objects so many there is the voice in one.
Then after­ wards in a Hæmonian chaunt she unfolds the rest, and her voice penetrates to Tartarus:
— " Eumenides, and Stygian fiends, and penalties of the guilty, and Chaos, eager to confound innumerable worlds;
and thou, Ruler of the earth2, whom the wrath of the Gods, deferred for lengthened ages, does vex;
Styx, and the Elysianfields, which no Thessalian sorceress is deserving of;
Persephone, who dost detest heaven and thy mother 3, and who art the lowest form of our Hecate', through whom the ghosts and I2 have the intercourse of- silent tongues ;
thou porter, too3, of the spacious abodes, who dost scatter our entrails before the savage dog;
and you, Sisters, about to handle the threads4 renewed, and thou, 0 ferryman of the burning stream, now, aged man, tired with the ghosts re­ turning to me;
listen to my prayers, if you sufficiently I invoke with mouth accursed and defiled, if, never fasting from human entrails, I repeat these charms, if full oft I have given you the teeming breasts, and have smothered your offerings5 with warm brains;
if any infant, when I have placed its head and entrails on your dishes, had been destined to live6;
listen to my entreaty.
A soul we ask for, that has not lain hid in the caves of Tartarus, and accustomed long to darkness, but one just descending, the light but lately withdrawn;
and which still delays at the very chasm of pallid Orcus.
Although it may listen to these spells, it shall come to the shades once again1.
Let the ghost of one but lately our soldier repeat the destinies of Pompey to the son of the chieftain, if the civil warfare deserves well at your hands.
"When, having said these things, she lifted up her head and her foaming lips, she beheld the ghost of the extended corpse standing by, dreading the lifeless limbs and the hated place of its former confinement.
It was dreading to go into the gaping breasts, and the entrails torn with a deadly wound.
Ah wretch!
from whom unrighteously the last privilege of death is snatched, to be able to die2!
Erictho is surprised that this delay has been permitted by the Fates, and, enraged with death, with living serpents she beats the unmoved body;
and through the hollow clefts of the earth, which with her charms she opens, she barks forth to the shades below, and breaks the silence of the realms:
­ " Tisiphone, and Megæra3, heedless of my voice, are ye not driving the wretched soul with your ruthless whips through the void space of Erebus ?
This moment under your real name4 will I summon you forth, and, Stygian bitches, will leave you in the light of the upper world;
amid graves will I follow you, amid funereal rites, your watcher;
from the tombs will I expel you, from all the urns will I drive you away.
And thee, Hecate, squalid with thy pallid form, will I expose to the Gods, before whom in false shape with other features thou art wont to come, and I will forbid thee to conceal the visage of Erebus.
I will disclose, damsel of Enna5, under the boundless bulk of the earth, -what feasts are detaining thee, upon what compact thou dost love the gloomy sovereign, to what corruption having submitted, thy parent was unwilling to call thee back "Against thee, most evil ruler of the world2, into thy burst caverns will I send the sun3, and with sudden daylight thou shalt be smitten.
Are you going to obey?
Or will he have to be addressed, by whom never, when named4, the shaken earth fails to tremble5, who beholds the Gorgon exposed to view6, and with his stripes chastises the quailing Erinnys, who occupies depths of Tartarus by you unseen;
in whose power you are7, ye Gods above ;
who by the Stygian waves forswears.
”
8Forthwith the clotted blood grows warm, and nourishes the blackened wounds, and runs into the veins and the ex­ tremities of the limbs.
Smitten beneath the cold breast, the lungs palpitate;
and a new life creeping on is mingled with the marrow so lately disused.
Then does every joint throb;
the sinews are stretched;
and not by degrees throughout the limbs does the dead body lift itself from the earth, and it is spurned by the ground, and raised erect at the same instant.
The eyes with their apertures distended wide are opened.
In it not as yet is there the face of one living, but of one now dying.
His paleness and his stiffness re­ main, and, brought back to the world, he is astounded.
But his sealed lips resound with no murmur.
A voice and a tongue to answer alone are granted unto him."
Tell me," says the Thessalian witch, "for a great re­ ward, what I command thee;
for, having spoken the truth, by the Hæmonian arts I will set thee free in all ages of the world;
with such a sepulchre will I grace thy limbs, with such wood will I burn them with Stygian spells, that thy charmed ghost shall hearken to no magicians.
Of such great value be it to have lived once again;
neither charms nor drugs shall presume to take away from thee the sleep of Lethe prolonged1, death being bestowed by me.
Obscure re­ sponses befit the tripods and the prophets of the Gods;
well assured he may depart whoever asks the truth of the shades, and boldly approaches the oracles of relentless death.
Spare not, I pray.
Give things their names, give the places, give the words by which the Fates may converse with me.
"She added a charm as well, by which she gave the ghost the power to know whatever she consulted him upon.
Sad, the tears running down, the corpse thus said :
— "
Called back from the heights of the silent shores I surely have not seen the sad threads of the Destinies ;
but, what from all the shades it has been allowed me to learn, fierce discord agitates the Roman ghosts2, and impious arms disturb the rest of hell.
Coming from different spots, some chieftains have left the Elysian abodes, and some the gloomy Tartarus;
what fate is preparing these have disclosed.
Sad was the countenance of the spirits of the blessed.
The Decii I beheld, both son and father, the souls that expiated the warfare, and Camillus weeping4, and the Curii5;
Sulla, too, Fortune, complaining of thee.
Scipio is de­ ploring his hapless descendant2, doomed to perish in the Libyan lands.
The elder Cato, the foe of Carthage3, be­ moans the destiny of his nephew who will not bo a slave.
“Thee, Brutus, first Consul, the tyrants expelled 4, alone rejoicing did I behold among the pious shades.
Threatening Catiline, his chains burst asunder and broken, exults, the fierce Marii, too, and the Cethegi with their bared arms5.
I beheld the Drusi exulting, names be­ loved by the populace6;
the Gracchi, exorbitant with their laws, and who dared such mighty exploits.
Hands, bound with the eternal knots of iron, and in the dungeon of Dis, clap in applause, and the guilty multitude demands the fields of the blessed.
The possessor of the empty realms is opening the pallid abodes, and is sharpening rocks torn off, and adamant hard with its chains, and is preparing punish­ ment for the conqueror.
Take back with thee, 0 youth, this comfort, that in their placid retreat the shades await thy father and thy house, and in the serene quarter of the realms are preparing room for Pompey."
And let not the glory of a short life cause thee anxiety;
the hour will come that is to mingle all chieftains alike.
Make ye haste to die, and proud with your high spirit go down though from humble graves, and tread under foot the ghosts of Romans deified A.
It is sought to know which tomb the wave of the Nile, and which that of the Tiber is to wash, and only is the combat among the chieftains as to2 their place of burial.
Seek not thou to know thy own destiny;
the Fates, while I am silent, will declare;
a prophet more sure, Pompey himself, thy sire, will declare all things to thee 3 in the Sicilian fields;
he, too, uncertain whither he shall invite thee, whence warn thee away, what regions to bid thee avoid, what Constellations of the world.
Wretched men, dread Europe, and Libya, and Asia4;
according to your triumphs5 does Fortune distribute your sepulchres.
0 wretched house, nothing throughout the whole earth wilt thou behold more safe than Emathia.”
6After he has thus revealed the Fates, gloomy with speech­ less features he stands, and demands death once again.
Magic incantations are needed, and drugs, that the carcase may fall, and the Fates are unable to restore the soul to themselves, the law of hell now once broken.
Then, with plenteous wood she builds up a pile ;
the dead man comes to the fires;
the youth placed upon the lighted heap Erictho leaves, permitting him at length to die;
and she goes attending Sextus to his father's camp.
The heavens wearing the aspect of light, until they brought their footsteps safe within the tents, the night, commanded to withhold the day1, afforded its dense shades.

The Poet concludes with imprecations against the scene of such horrors, 847-872.NEVER more tardy from the ocean than the eternal laws demand, did mournful Titan speed on his steeds along the heavens;
and he checked his chariot, as the skies whirled him along.
He was both ready to endure eclipse, and the grievance of light withdrawn;
and he attracted clouds, not as food for his flames1, but lest he might shine serenely upon the regions of Thessaly.
But the night, the last portion of fortunate existence for Magnus, deceived his anxious slumbers with vain pros­ pects.
For he seemed to himself, in the seat of the Pom- peian Theatre1, to behold forms innumerable of the com­ monalty of Rome, and his own name raised with joyous voices to the stars, and the resounding tiers2 contending in applause.
Such were the looks and the shouts of the applauding populace, when formerly, a young man, and at the period of his first triumph, after the nations which the rushing Iberus surrounds were subdued, and the arms which the flying Sertoriusa urged on, the West having been reduced to peace, revered as much in his white toga as in that which adorned the chariot, the Senate giving applause, he sat, as yet but a Roman knight.
Whether, at the end of successes, anxious for the future, sleep flew back to joyous times, or whether, prophesying, by its wonted perversions, things contrary to what is seen, it bore the omens of great woe;
or whether to thee, for­ bidden any more to behold thy paternal abodes, Fortune in this fashion presented Rome.
Break not his slumbers, ye sentinels of the camp;
let no trumpet resound in his ears.
The rest of the morrow, direful, and saddened with the image of the day, will from every quarter bring the blood- stained ranks, from every side the war.
Whence canst thou then obtain the slumbers of the populacel and a happy night?
0 blessed, if even thus thy Rome could behold thee!
Would that, Magnus, the Gods of heaven had granted a single day to thy country and to thee, on which either, assured of destiny, might have enjoyed the last blessing of affection so great2.
Thou goest as though destined to die3 in the Ausonian city.
She, conscious to herself of her assured wishes in behalf of thee, has not believed that this evil ever existed in destiny;
that thus she is to lose the tomb even of Magnus.
Thee, with mingling griefs, would both old men and youths have bewailed, and the child un­ taught.
The female throng, their locks dishevelled, would, as at the funeral of Brutus4, have torn their breasts.
Now even, although they may fear the darts of the unscrupulous victor, although Cæsar himself may bring word of thy death, they will weep ;
but, while they are bringing frankin­ cense, while laurel wreaths to the Thunderer5.
0 wretched people, whose groans devour their griefs!
who equally lament thee in the Theatre no longer full!
The sunbeams had conquered the stars, when, with the mingled murmur of the camps the multitude resounded, and, the Fates dragging on the world to ruin, demanded the signal for combat.
The greatest part of the wretched throng, not destined to behold the day throughout, mur­ murs around the very tent of the general, and, inflamed, with vast tumult, urges on the speeding hours of approach­ ing death.
Direful frenzy arises;
each one desires to pre­ cipitate his own destinies and those of the state.
Pompey is called slothful and timorous, and too sparing of his father- in-law, and attached to his sway of the world1, in desiring to have at the same moment so many nations from every part under his own control, and being in dread of peace.
Still more, both the kings and the eastern nations, too, com­ plain that the war is prolonged, and that they are detained at a distance from their native land.
Is it your pleasure, 0 Gods of heaven, when it is your purpose to overthrow all things, to add to our errors this crime2?
We rush on upon slaughter, and arms that are to injure ourselves we demand.
In the camp of Pompey, Phar­ salia is an object of desire!
Tullius, the greatest author of Roman eloquence, beneath whose rule and Consular toga the fierce Catiline trembled at the axes3, producers of peace, enraged with the warfare, while he longed for the Rostra and the Forum, having, as a soldier, submitted to a silence so prolonged, reported the language of all.
Eloquence added its powers 1 to the feeble cause :
—
“Fortune requests this only of thee, Magnus, in return for favours so numerous, that thou wilt be ready to make use of her;
both we, the nobles in thy camp, and thy kings, with the suppliant world pressing around thee, entreat that thou wilt permit thy father-in-law to be overcome.
Shall Cfesar for so long a time be cause of war to mankind?
With reason is it distasteful to nations subdued by thee when speeding past them, that Pompey should be slow in victory.
Whither has thy spirit fled, or where is thy confidence in destiny?
Dost thou have apprehensions, ungrateful man, as to the Gods of heaven?
And dost thou hesitate to trust the cause of the Senate to the Deities ?
“The troops themselves will tear up thy standards, and will spring forward to the combat.
Let it shame thee to have conquered by compulsion.
If by thee as our appointed leader, if by us wars are waged, be it their right to meet upon whatever field they please.
Why dost thou avert the swords of the whole world from the blood of Cæsar ?
Hands are brandishing weapons;
with difficulty does each await the delaying standards;
make haste that thy own trumpet-call may not forsake thee.
Magnus, the Senate long to know3 whether they are to follow thee as soldiers or whether as companions.
”The leader groaned, and perceived that this was a subter­ fuge of the Gods, and that the Destinies were opposed to his own feelings."
If this is the pleasure of all” he said;
“if the occasion requires Magnus as a soldier, not a general, no further will I delay the Fates.
In one ruin let Fortune involve the nations, and let this day be to a large portion of mankind the very last.
Still,
Rome, I call thee to witness, that Magnus has received1, the day on which all things came to ruin.
The labour of the war might have cost thee no wound2;
it might have delivered up the leader, subdued without slaughter and a captive, to violated peace3.
What frenzy is this in crimes, 0 ye, blind to fate?
Do they dread to wage a civil war, so as not to conquer with blood ?
The earth we have wrested from him4, from the whole ocean we have excluded him;
his famishing troops we have compelled to premature rapine of the crops5;
and in the enemy have we wrought the wish to prefer to be slaughtered with swords, and to mingle the deaths of his partisans with my own."
A great part of the warfare has been accomplished in those measures, by which it has been brought about that the raw recruit is in no dread of the combat, if only under the excitement of valour and in the heat of resentment they de­ mand the standards to be raised.
The very fear of an evil about to come has committed many a one to extreme dangers.
He is the bravest man, who, ready to endure what is deserving of fear, if it impends close at hand, can also defer it.
Is it your pleasure to abandon this so pros- perous state of things to Fortune, to leave the hazard of the world to the sword ?
They wish rather for their leader to fight than to conquer.
Fortune, thou hadst granted me the Roman state to rule;
receive it still greater, and protect it amid the blindness of warfare.
“War will be neither the crime nor the glory of Pompey.
Before the Gods of heaven, thou dost conquer me, Cæsar, by thy hostile prayers.
The battle is now fought.
What an amount of crimes, and of evils an extent how vast will this day bring upon nations !
how many kingdoms will lie in ruin!
How turbid will Enipeus run1 with Roman blood!
I could wish that the first dart of this lamentable warfare would strike this head, if without the ruin of the state and the downfall of the party, it were about to fall;
for not more joyous to Magnus will victory prove.
To nations, this slaughter per­ petrated, Pompey will be this day either a hated or a pitied name2.
Every woe that the allotted destiny of things shall bring will belong to the conquered, to the conqueror every crime.
"Thus he speaks, and allows the combat to the nations, and gives loose rein to them as they rage with anger;
and just as the mariner, overpowered by the boisterous Corus, leaves the rudder to the winds, and, skill abandoned, a sluggish burden, the ship is borne along.
Confused, with an anxious murmuring the camp resounds, and bold hearts throb against their breasts with uncertain palpitations.
On the countenances of many is the paleness of approaching death, and an aspect strongly indicating their destiny.
It is clear that the day is come, which is to bestow a fate for everlasting upon human affairs, and it is manifest, that in that combat it is sought what Rome is to be a.
His own dangers each man knows not, distracted with greater fears.
Who, beholding the shores overwhelmed by sea, who, seeing the ocean on the summits of mountains, and the sky, the sun hurled down, falling upon the earth, the downfall of things so numerous, could feel fear for himself?
There is no leisure to have apprehensions for one's self;
for the City and for Magnus is the alarm.
Nor have they confidence in their swords, unless the points shine sharpened with the whetstone.
Then is every javelin pointed against the rock;
with better strings they tighten the bows;
it is a care to fill the quivers with chosen arrows 1.
The horseman, increases the spurs, and fits on the thongs of the reins.
If it is lawful to compare the labours of men with the Gods of heaven, not otherwise, Phlegra supporting the furious Giants 2, did the sword of Mars grow warm upon the Sicilian anvils 3 ;
and a second time the trident of Neptune grew red with flames, and, Python lying prostrate, Pæan renewed his darts, Pallas scattered the locks of the Gorgon upon her Ægis, and the Cyclops moulded anew the Pallensean thunderbolts of Jove 4.
Fortune, however, did not forbear by various marks to disclose the woes about to ensue.
For while they were re­ pairing to the Thessalian fields, the whole sky opposed them as they come, and in the eyes of the men the lightnings rent asunder the clouds;
and torches meeting them, and columns of immense flames, and the sky presented ser­ pentine forms, greedy of the waves 1, with fiery meteors intermingled, and with hurled lightnings dimmed their eyes.
The crests it struck off from their helmets 2, and dissolved the hilts of their melted swords, and liquefied the darts torn away 3, and made the hurtful weapon to smoke with sulphur from the skies.
Moreover, the standards, covered with swarms innu­ merable 4, and with difficulty torn up from the ground 5, bowed the head of the standard-bearer, weighed down with an unusual burden, soaking with tears, even as far as Thessaly the standards of Rome and of the republic 6.
The bull, urged onward for the Gods above, flies from the spurned altar, and throws himself headlong along the Emathian fields;
and for the sad rites no victim is found.
But thou, Cæsar, what heavenly Gods of criminality, what Eumenides, didst thou with due ceremonials invoke 7?
What Deities of the Stygian realms, and what infernal fiends, and monsters steeped in night, didst thou pro­ pitiate, so ruthlessly about to wage the impious warfare?
Now (it is matter of doubt whether they believed the por­ tents of the Gods, or their own excessive fears), Pindus seemed to many to meet with Olympus, and Hæmus to sink in the deep valleys, Pharsalia to send forth by night the din of warfare, flowing blood to run along Ossæan Bœbeis1;
and in turn they wondered at their features being concealed, amid gloomy and at the day growing pale, and at night hovering over their helmets, and their departed parents and all the ghosts of their kindred flitting before their eyes.
But to their minds this was one consola­ tion, in that the throng, conscious of their wicked intentions, who hoped for the throats of their fathers, who longed for the breasts of their brothers, exulted in these portents and the tumultuous feelings of their minds, and deemed the sudden portents to be omens of their impious deeds.
What wonder, that nations, whom3 the last day of liberty was awaiting, trembled with frantic fear, if a mind fore­ knowing woes is granted to mankind ?
The Roman, who, a stranger, lies adjacent to Tyrian Gades 1 and he who drinks of Armenian Araxes2, beneath whatever clime, beneath whatever Constellation of the universe he is, is sad, and is ignorant of the cause, and chides his flagging spirits;
he knows not what he is losing on the Emathian plains.
An augur, if there is implicit credit3 to be given to those who relate it, sitting on the Euganean hill 4, where the steaming Aponus 5 arises from the earth, and the waters of Timavus of Antenor" are dispersed in various channels, exclaimed:
­ " The critical day is come, a combat most momentous is being waged, the impious arms of Pompey and of Cæsar are meeting."
Whether it was that he marked the thun­ ders and the presaging weapons of Jove, or beheld the whole sky and the poles standing still in the discordant heavens;
or whether the saddening light in the sky pointed out the fight by the gloomy paleness of the sun.
The day of Thessaly undoubtedly did nature introduce unlike to all the days which she displays;
if, universally, with the experienced augur, the mind of man had marked7 the unusual phenomena of the heavens, Pharsalia might have been beheld by the whole world.
0 mightiest of men, the indications of whom Fortune afforded throughout the earth, to whose destinies all heaven had leisure to attend!
These deeds, both among future nations and the races of your descendants, whether by their own fame alone they shall come down to remote ages, or whether the care of my labours is in any degree able as well to profit mighty names, when the wars shall be read of, will excite both hopes and fears, and wishes destined to be of no avail;
and all, moved, shall read of thy fate as though approaching and not concluded, and still, Magnus, shall wish thee success.
The soldiers, when, gleamed upon by the opposite rays of Phœbus, descending, they have covered all the hills with glittering brightness, are not promiscuously sent forth upon the plains;
in firm array stand the doomed ranks.
To thee, Lentulus, is entrusted the care of the left wingl, to­ gether with the first legion, which then was the best in war, and the fourth;
to thee, Domitius2, valiant, with the Deity adverse, is given the front of the army on the right.
But the bravest troops redouble the strength of the centre of the battle, which, drawn forth from the lands of the Cilicians, Scipio commands 3, the chief commander in the Libyan land 1, a soldier in this.
But near the streams and the waters 2 of the flowing Enipeus, the mountain cohorts of the Cappadocians3 and the Pontic cavalry with their loose reins 4, take their stand.
But most of the positions on the dry plain5 Tetrarchs and Kings 6 and mighty potentates held, and all the purple which is obedient to the Latian sword.
Thither, too, did Libya send her Numidians 7, and Crete her Cydonians";
thence was there a flight for the arrows of Ituræa 9;
thence, fierce Gauls, did you1 sally forth against your wonted foe;
there did Iberia wield her contending bucklers 2.
Tear from the victor the nations4, Magnus, and, the blood of the world spilt at one moment, cut shortfor him all triumphs.
On that day, by chance, his position being left, Cæsar, about to move his standards for foraging in the standing corn4, suddenly beholds the enemy descending into the level plains, and sees the opportunity presented to him, a thousand times asked for in his prayers, upon which he is-to submit everything to the last chance.
For, sick of delay, and burning with desire for rule, he had begun, in this short space of time, to condemn the civil war as slow-paced wickedness.
After he saw the fates of the chieftains drawing nigh, and the closing combat at hand, and perceived the falling ruins of destiny tottering, this frenzy even, most eager for the sword, flagged in a slight degree, and his mind, which his own fortunes did not permit to fear, nor those of Magnus to hope, bold to engage for a prosperous result, hesitated in suspense 1.
Fear thrown aside, confidence sprang up, better suited for encouraging the ranks :
­ " 0 soldiers, subduers of the world 2, the stay of my for­ tunes3, the opportunity for the fight so oft desired is come.
No need is there for prayers;
now hasten your destinies by the sword.
You have in your own power how mighty Cæsar is to prove.
This is that day which I remember being pro­ mised me4 at the waves of Rubicon, in hope of which we took up arms, to which we deferred the return of our forbidden triumphs5.
This is that same which is this day6 to restore our pledges, and which is to give us back our household Gods, and, your period of service completed, is to make you tillers of the land.
This the day, which, fate being the witness, is to prove who the most righteously has taken up arms;
this battle is destined to make the conquered the guilty one.
"If for me with sword and with flames you have attacked your country, now fight valiantly, and absolve your swords from blame.
No hand, the judge of the warfare being changed 1, is guiltless.'
Not my fortunes are at stake, but that you yourselves may be a free people do I pray, that you may-hold sway over all nations.
I, myself, anxious to surrender myself to a private station, and to settle myself as an humble citizen in a plebeian toga2, refuse to be nothing3 until all this is granted to you.
With the blame my own do you obtain the sway.
And with no great bloodshed do you aspire to the hope of the world:
a band of youths selected from the Grecian wrestling schools, and rendered effeminate by the pursuits of the places of exercise4, will be before you, and wielding their arms with difficulty;
the discordant bar­ barism, too, of a mingled multitude, that will not be able to endure the trumpets, nor, the army moving on, their own shouts.
But few hands with them5 will be waging a civil war;
a great part of the combat will rid the earth of these nations, and will break down the Roman foe.
Go onward amid dastard nations and realms known by report, and with the first movement of the sword lay prostrate the world;
and let it be known that the nations which, so numerous, Pompey at his chariot led into the City, are not worth a single triumph 1.
"Docs it concern the Armenians to what chieftain the Roman sway belongs ?
Or does any barbarian wish to place Magnus over the Hesperian state, purchased with-the least bloodshed ?
All Romans they detest, and most do they hate the rulers whom they have known.
But me Fortune has entrusted to bands of whom Gaul has made me witness in so many campaigns.
Of which soldier shall I not recognize the sword?
And when a quivering javelin passes through the air, I shall not be deceived in pronouncing by what arm it has been poised.
And if I behold the indications that never deceived your leader, both stern faces and threatening eyes, then have you proved the victors.
Rivers of blood do I seem to behold, and both Kings trodden under foot, and the corpses of Senators scattered, and nations swimming in boundless carnage."
But I am delaying my own destinies in withholding you by these words from rushing upon the weapons.
Grant me pardon for procrastinating the combat.
I exult in hopes;
never have I beheld the Gods of heaven about to present gifts so great, so close at hand for me;
at the slight distance of this plain arc we removed from our wishes.
I am he who shall be empowered, the battle finished, to make dona­ tions of what nations and monarchs possess.
By what commotion in the skies, by what star of heaven turned back, ye Gods above, do ye grant thus much to the Thes­ salian land?"
This day, either the reward of the warfare or the punishment is awarded.
Behold the crosses for Cresar's partisans1 behold the chains!
this head, too, exposed on the Rostra2, and my torn limbs, and the criminal doings at the voting-places3, and the battles in the enclosed Plain of Mars.
With a chieftain of Sulla's party are we waging civil war.
It is care for you that moves me.
For a lot, free from care, sought by my own hand, shall await myself;
he who, the foe not yet subdued, shall look back, shall behold me piercing my own vitals.
Ye Gods, whose care the earth and the woes of Rome have drawn down from the skies, let him conquer, who does not deem it necessary to unsheathe against the conquered the ruthless sword, and who does not think that his own fellow-citizens, because they have raised hostile standards, have committed a crime.
When he enclosed your troops in a blockaded place, your valour forbidden to be employed, with how much blood'¡ did Pompey glut the sword!"
Still, youths, this do I ask of you, that no one will be ready to smite the back of the foe;
he who flies, let him be a fellow-citizen 5).
But while the darts are glittering, let not any fiction of affection, nor even parents beheld with adverse front, affect you ;
mangle with the sword 6 the venerated fea.
tures.
Whether one shall rush with hostile weapon against a kinsman's breast, or whether with his wound he shall violate no ties of relationship, let him attack the throat of an unknown foe, just the same as incurring the criminality of slaughtering a relative.
Forthwith lay the ramparts low, and fill up the trenches with the ruins, that in full maniples, not straggling, the army may move on.
Spare not the camp;
within those ines 1 shall you pitch your tents, from which the army is coming doomed to perish.
"Cæsar having hardly said all this 2, his duties attract each one, and instantly their arms are taken up by the men.
Swiftly they forestall the presage of the war3, and, their camp trodden under foot, they rush on;
in no order4 do they stand, with no disposition made by their general;
everything they leave to destiny.
If in the direful combat you had placed so many fathers-in-law of Magnus, and so many aspiring to the sway of their own city, not with course so precipitate would they have rushed to the combat.
When Pompey beheld the hostile troops coming forth straight on, and allowing no respite for the war, but that the day was pleasing to the Gods of heaven, with frozen heart he stood astounded ;
and for a chieftain so great thus to dread arms was ominous.
Then he repressed his fears, and, borne on a stately steed along all the ranks, he said :
­ "
The day which your valour demands, the end of the civil warfare which you have looked for, is at hand.
Show forth all your might;
the last work of the sword is at hand, and one hour drags on nations to their fate.
Whoever looks for his country and his dear household Gods;
who looks for his offspring, and conjugal endearments, and his deserted pledges of affection, let him seek them with the sword;
everything has the Deity set at stake in the midst of tho plain.
Our cause the better one bids us hope for the Gods of heaven as favouring;
they themselves will direct the darts through the vitals of Cæsar;
they themselves will be desirous with this blood to ratify the Roman laws.
If they had been ready to grant to my father-in-law kingly sway and the world, they were able, by fatality, to hurry on my old age.
It is not the part of the Gods, angered at nations and the City, to preserve Pompey as their leader."
Everything that could possibly conquer have we con­ tributed.
Illustrious men have of their own accord sub­ mitted to dangers, and the veteran soldier, with his holy resemblance to the heroes of old.
If the Fates at these troublous times would permit the Curii and the Camilli to come back, and the Decii, who devoted their lives to death, on this side would they take their stand.
Nations collected from the remote East, and cities innumerable, have aroused bands to battle so mighty as they never sent forth before.
At the same moment the whole world do we employ.
Whatever men there are included within the limits of the heavens1 that bear the Constellations, beneath Notus and Boreas, here are we, arms do we wield.
Shall we not with our wings extended around place the collected foe in the midst of us?
Few right hands does victory require;
and many troops will only wage the warfare with their shouts.
Cæsar suffices not for our arms 2." Think that your mothers, hanging over the summits of the walls of the City, with their dishevelled hair, are en­ couraging you to battle.
Think that a Senate, aged, and forbidden by years to follow arms, are prostrating at your feet their hallowed hoary locks;
and that Rome herself, dreading a tyrant, comes to meet you.
Think that that which now is the people, and that which shall be the people, are offering their mingled prayers.
Free does this mul­ titude wish to be born;
free does that wish to die.
If, after pledges so great, there is any room for Pompey, suppliant with my offspring and my wife, if with the majesty of com­ mand preserved it were possible, I would throw myself before your feet.
I, Magnus, unless you conquer, an exile, the scorn of my father-in-law, your own disgrace, do earn­ estly deprecate my closing destinies, and the disastrous years of the latest period of my life, that I may not, an aged man, learn to be a slave.
"At the voice of their general uttering words so sad their spirits are inflamed, and the Roman valour is aroused, and it pleases them to die if he is in fear of the truth.
Therefore on either side do the armies meet with a like impulse of anger;
the fear of rule arouses the one, the hope of it the other.
These right hands shall do what no age can supply, nor the human race throughout all ages repair, even though it should be free from the sword.
This warfare shall overwhelm future nations, and shall cut short to the world the people of ages to come, the day of their birth being torn away from them.
Then shall all the Latin name be a fable;
the ruins concealed in dust shall hardly be able to point out Gabii1, Veii2, and Cora3, and the deserted fields shall hardly show the homes of Alba and the household Gods of Laurentum4, which the Senator would not inhabit, except upon the night ordained 5, with re­ luctance, and complaining that Numa has so ordained.
These monuments of things devouring time has not consumed, and has left still crumbling away;
the crime of civil war we behold, cities so many deserted 6.
To what has the multitude of the human race been reduced ?
We nations who are born throughout the whole world are able to fill neither the fortified places nor the fields with men;
one City receives us all.
By the chained delver7 are the corn-fields of Hesperia tilled ;
mouldering with its an­ cestorial roofs stands the house, about to fall upon none;
and Rome, thronged with no citizens of her own, but filled with the dregs of the world, did we surrender to that extent of slaughter that thenceforth for a period so long no civil war could possibly be waged.
Of woes so great was Pharsalia the cause.
Let Cannæ yield, a fatal name 1, and Allia, long condemned in the Roman annals 2.
Rome has marked these as occasions of lighter woes, this day she longs to ignored
Oh shocking destinies!
The air pestilential in its course, and shifting diseases, and maddening famine, and cities abandoned to flames, and earthquakes about to hurl popu­ lous cities4 headlong, those men might have repaired, whom from every side Fortune has dragged to a wretched death, while, tearing away the gifts 5 of lengthened ages, she dis­ plays them, and ranges both nations and chieftains upon the plains;
through whom she may, Rome, disclose to thee, as thou dost come to ruin, how mighty thou dost fall.
The more widely she has possessed the world, the more swiftly through her prospering destinies has she run.
Throughout all ages, has every.
war given subdued nations unto thee;
thee has Titan beheld advancing towards the two poles1.
Not much space was there remaining of the eastern earth, but what for thee the night, for thee the entire day, for thee the whole heavens should speed on, and the wandering stars behold all things belonging to Rome.
But the fatal day of Emathia bore back thy destinies, equal to all these years 2.
On this blood-stained morn was it caused that India does not shudder3 at the Latian fasces, and that she does not lead the Dahæ4 into walled cities forbidden to wander, and that no tightly-girt Consul presses on3 a Sarmatian plough.
This is the cause that Parthia is ever owing to thee a cruel retribution;
that flying from civil strife, and never to return, Liberty has withdrawn beyond the Tigris and the Rhine, and, so oft sought by us at hazard of our throats 6, still wanders abroad, a blessing to Germany and Scythia, and no further looks back upon Ausonia.
Would that she had been unknown to our people, and that thou, Rome, from the time when first Romulus filled the walls founded at the left-hand flight of the vultures from the guilty grove, even unto the Thessalian downfall, hadst re­ mained enslaved.
Fortune, of the Bruti do I complaint
Why have we framed the periods of our laws, or why made the years to take their name from the Consul ?
Happy the Arabians, and the Medes, and the Eastern lands, which the Fates have kept under continued tyrants.
Of the nations which endure rule our lot is the last, who are ashamed to be slaves.
Assuredly we have no Divinities;
whereas ages are hurried along by blind chance, we falsely allege that Jupiter reigns.
Will he look down from the lofty skies upon the Thessalian carnage, while he is wielding the lightnings 1 ?
Will he, forsooth, hurl at Pholoë, hurl at Œta with his flames, the groves, too, of the guiltless Rhodope, and the pine-woods of Mimas 2, shall Cassius, in 3 prefer­ ence, smite this head ?
The stars against Thyestes did he urge on, and condemn Argos to sudden night4;
shall .he afford the light of day to Thessaly that wields the kindred swords so numerous of brothers and of parents ?
Mortal affairs are cared for by no God.
Still for this slaughter do we obtain satisfaction, as much as it is proper for the Deities to give to the earth.
The civil wars will create Divinities5 equal to the Gods of heaven.
The shades will Rome adorn 6 with lightnings and with rays and stars;
and in the temples of the Gods will she swear by the shades of men.
When with a rapid step they have now passed over the space that delays the closing moments of destiny, separated by a small strip of ground, thence do they look upon the bands and seek to recognise their features, where their jave­ lins are to fall, or what fate is threatening themselves, what monstrous deeds they are to perpetrate.
Parents they be­ hold with faces fronting them, and the arms of brothers in hostile array, nor do they choose to change their positions1.
Still, a numbness binds all their breasts;
and the cold blood, their feelings of affection smitten, congeals in their -vitals;
and whole cohorts for a long time hold the javelins in readiness with outstretched arms.
May the Gods send thee, Crastinus2, not the death which is prepared as a punishment for all, but after thy end sensation in thy death, hurled by whose band the javelin commenced the battle, and first stained Thessaly with Roman blood.
0 headlong frenzy, when Cæsar with­ held the darts, was there found any hand more forward!
Then was the resounding air rent by clarions 1, and the battle call given by the cornet;
then did the trumpets pre­ sume to give the signal;
then did a crash reach the skies, and burst upon the arched top of loftiest Olympus, from which the clouds are far removed, and whither no light­ nings last to penetrate.
With its re-echoing valleys
Hæmus received the noise, and gave it to the caves of Pelion again to redouble;
Pindus sent forth the uproar, and the rocks of Pangæum resounded, and the crags of Œta groaned, and the sounds of their own fury did they dread re-echoed throughout all the land.
Darts innumerable are scattered abroad with various intents.
Some wish for wounds, some to fix the javelins in the earth, and to keep their hands in purity.
Chance hurries everything on, and uncertain Fortune makes those guilty, whom she chooses.
But how small a part2 of the slaughter is perpetrated with javelins and flying weapons!
For civil hatred the sword alone suffices, and guides right hands to Roman vitals.
The ranks of Pompey, densely disposed in deep bodies, joined their arms, their shields closed together in a line 1;
and, hardly able to find room for moving their right hands and their darts, they stood close, and, wedged together, kept their swords sheathed.
With headlong course the furious troops of Cæsar are impelled against the dense masses, and, through arms, through the foe do they seek a passage.
Where the .
twisted coat of mail2 presents its links, and the breast, beneath a safe covering, lies concealed, even here do they reach the entrails, and amid so many arms it is the vitals which each one pierces.
Civil war does the one army suffer, the other wage;
on the one hand the sword stands chilled, on Cæsar's side every guilty weapon waxes hot.
Nor is Fortune long, overthrowing the weight of des­ tinies so vast, in sweeping away the mighty ruins, fate rushing on.
When first the cavalry of Pompey?
extended his wings over the whole plain, and poured them forth along the ex­ tremities of the battle, the light-armed soldiers, scattered along the exterior of the maniples, followed, and sent forth their ruthless bands against the foe.
There, each nation is mingling in thecombat with weapons its own;
Roman blood is sought by all.
On the one side arrows, on the other torches and stones are flying, and plummets, melting in the tract of air and liquefied with their heated masses .
Then do both Ituræans, and Medians, and Arabians, a multitude threatening with loosened bow, never aim their arrows, but the air alone is sought which impends over the plain;
thence fall various deaths.
But with no criminality of guilt 1 do they stain the foreign steel;
around the jave­ lins stands collected all the guiltiness2.
With weapons the heaven is concealed, and a night, wrought by the darts, hovers over the fields.
Then did Cæsar, fearing lest his front rank might be shaken by the onset, keep in reserve some cohorts in an oblique position behind the standards 3, and on the sides of his line, whither the enemy, scattered about, was betaking himself, he suddenly sent forth a column, his own wings unmoved.
Unmindful of the fight, and to be feared by reason of no sense of shame, they openly took to flight;
not well was civil warfare ever entrusted to barbarian troops.
As soon as the charger, his breast pierced with the weapon, trod upon the limbs of the rider hurled upon his head, each horseman fled from the field, and, crowded together, turning bridle, the youths rushed on upon their own ranks.
Then did the carnage lose all bounds, and it was no battle that ensued, but on the one hand with their throats 1 on the other with the sword, the war was waged;
nor was the one army able to lay low as many as were able to perish on the other side.
Would that, Pharsalia, for thy plains that blood which barbarian breasts pour forth would suffice:
that the streams might be changed by no other gore;
that this throng might for thee cover whole fields with bones;
or if thou dost prefer to be glutted with Roman blood, spare the others, I en­ treat ;
let the Galatians and Syrians live, the Cappadocians and the Gauls, and the Iberians from the extremity of the world, the Armenians and the Cilicians;
for after the civil wars these will form the Roman people.
Once commenced, the panic reaches all, and to the Fates is an impulse given in favour of Cæsar.
They had now come to the strength of Magnus and the mid ranks.
The war, which, in its wandering course, had strayed over whole fields, here paused, and the fortune of Ctesar delayed.
On this spot no youths collected by the aid of kings are waging the war, and no alien hands 2 wield the sword;
this spot contains their brothers, this spot their fathers.
Here is frenzy, here frantic rage;
here, Cæsar, are thy crimes.
My soul, fly from this portion of the warfare3, and leave it to the shades of night, and, myself the Poet of woes so great, let no age learn how great is the licence in civil warfare.
Perish rather these tears, and perish these complaints.
Whatever, Rome, in this battle thou hast done, upon it I will be silent.
Here Cæsar, the prompting fury of his people, and the exciter of their rage, lest upon any side his guilt may prove unavailing, goes to and fro around the troops and adds flames to their fired hearts;
he examines the swords, too 1, which ones are dripping all over with gore, which ones are shining stained with blood just at the point only, which hand falters in pressing home the sword, who it is that bears his weapons but languidly, who tightly grasped, who with alacrity wages the war at command, who takes a pleasure in fighting, who changes countenance on a fellow-citizen being slain;
he surveys the carcases strewed over the wide plains.
The wounds of many, about to pour forth all their blood, he himself stanches 2, by placing his hand against them.
Wherever he roves, just as Bellona3, shaking her blood- stained whip, or Mars inciting4 the Bistonians, if with severe lashes he urges on his chariot steeds frightened by the Ægis of Pallas, a vast night of crimes and slaughters ensues, and groans like one immense cry, and arms resound with the weight of the falling breast, and swords shivered against swords.
He himself with his own hand supplies falchions, and provides darts, and bids them mangle the opposing faces with their weapons.
He himself urges on the ranks;
and onward drives the backs of his own men;
those slackening he forces on with blows of his .lance reversed.
He forbids their hands to be directed against the common people, and points out the Senators1.
He knows well which is the blood of the state, which are the vitals of the republic;
in which direction he is to speed on , to Rome, in which spot stands to be smitten the final liberty of the world.
Mingled with the second rank 3, the nobles and the venerated bodies are pressed upon by the sword;
Lepidi they slay, Metelli, too, they slay, Corvini as well, and those with the names of Tor­ quatus, often the rulers of kings, and the chiefs of men, thee, Magnus, excepted.
There, concealing thy features 5 in a plebeian helmet, and unknown to the foe, what a weapon, Brutus6, thou didst wield!
0 honor to the state, 0 final hope of the Senate, last name of a race for ages so renowned, rush not too rashly through the midst of the foe, and hasten not for thyself too soon the fatal Philippi, doomed to perish in a Thessaly of thy own 1.
Nothing there dost thou avail by aiming at Cæsar’s throat;
not yet has he arrived at the summit of power, and having surpassed that human eleva­ tion, by which all things are swayed, has by the Fates been made deserving of so noble a death.
Let him live, and that he may fall the victim of Brutus, let him reign.
Here perished all the glory of thy native land;
in large heaps patrician corpses lay on the plain 2, the vulgar not intermingled.
Still, however, amid the slaughter of illustrious men the death of the valiant Domitius 3 was distinguished, whom the Destinies led through every reversed Never did the fortunes of Magnus fail without him;
conquered by Cæsar so oft, his liberty saved, he dies.
Then joyously did he fall amid a thousand wounds, and he rejoiced to have been spared a second pardon5.
Cæsar beheld him rolling his limbs amid the clotted blood, and, upbraiding him, ex­ claimed, " Now, my successor, Domitius6, thou dost abandon the arms of Magnus;
without thee now is the warfare waged.
"He spoke, but the breath of Domitius struggling in his breast sufficed him for a voice, and he thus opened his dying lips :
“Beholding thee, Cæsar, not yet in possession of the direful reward of thy crimes, but doubtful of thy fate, and less mighty than thy son-in-law, I go to the shades free and void of care, Magnus being my leader:
for thee to be subdued in the ruthless warfare, and to be about to pay a heavy penalty to Pompey and to us, while I die, it is allowed me to hope."
Life fled from him having said no more, and dense shades pressed upon his eyes.
I scruple to expend tears at the downfall of the world upon deaths innumerable, and, tracing them out, to enquire into individual fates;
through whose vitals the deadly wound made its way;
who it was that trod upon entrails scattered on the ground;
who, the hostile sword being thrust into his jaws, dying, breathed forth his soul;
who fell down at the blow;
who, while his limbs dropped down, lopped off, stood upright;
who received the darts right through the breast, or whom the lance pinned to the plain;
whose blood, the veins being severed, gushed through the air, and fell upon the arms of his foe;
who pierced the breast of his brother, and that he might be able to spoil the well-known carcase, threw afar the head cut off;
who mangled the features of a parent, and by his extreme fury would prove to lookers-on that he whom he stabbed was not his father.
No death is deserving of a lament its own, and no indi­ viduals have we the leisure to mourn.
Pharsalia had not those features of combat which other slaughters had1;
there did Rome perish by the fates of individuals, here by mul­ titudes;
that which was there the death of a soldier, was here that of a nation;
there flowed Achæan blood, Pontic and Assyrian;
the gore of all did the Roman torrent forbid to remain and stagnate upon the plain.
Greater wounds do nations receive from this battle-field than their own times can endure;
that which perishes is more than life and safety;
to all ages of the world are we laid prostrate;
by these swords is every generation conquered which shall be a slave.
How have the succeeding race, or how the grand­ children, deserved to be born to thraldom?
Did we wield arms with fear?
Or did we cover up our throats?
The punishment of others' fears sits heavy upon our necks.
If, Fortune, to those born after the battle thou dost give a tyrant, thou shouldst have given warfare as well.
Now had the wretched Magnus perceived that the Gods and the destinies of Rome had forsaken him;
hardly pre­ vailed upon by the whole slaughter to rebuke his own for­ tune.
He stood upon a rising ground of the plain, on high, whence he could behold all the carnage scattered over the Thessalian fields, which, while the battle hindered, lay concealed.
With weapons so many he beheld his destinies attacked, so many bodies lying prostrate, and himself pe­ rishing with bloodshed so great.
Nor yet, as is the way of the unfortunate, does he take pleasure in dragging, together with himself, everything to sink, by involving nations in his own ruin;
that after himself the greatest part of the Latian multitude may survive, he endures even yet to deem the inhabitants of heaven worthy of his prayers, and reflects upon this solace of his misfortune“Forbear, ye Gods of heaven," he says, “to lay all na­ tions prostrate;
the world still existing and Rome surviving, Magnus can possibly be wretched.
If still more wounds of mine please you, I have a wife, I have sons;
so many pledges have I given to the Fates.
Is it too little for a civil war if myself and mine thou dost overwhelm?
Is our down­ fall a trifle, the world being exempted?
Why dost thou rend everything;
why dost thou strive to destroy all things?
Now, Fortune, nothing is my own.
"Thus he speaks, and he rides around the arms and the standards and the smitten troops on every side, and he calls them back as they rush upon a speedy death, and denies that he is of value so great.
Nor to the chieftain is courage wanting to rush upon the swords, and to submit to death with throat or with breast;
but he fears lest, the body of Magnus laid low, the soldiers may not fly, and over the chieftain the earth may fall;
or else from Cæsar’s eyes he wishes to remove his death.
In vain.
Unhappy man, to thy father-in-law, willing to behold it1, must the head be shown in some place.
But thou, too, his wife, art the cause of his flight, and thy features, so well remembered;
and by the Fates has it been decided that he shall die in thy presence.
Then, spurred on, the charger bears Magnus away2 from the combat, not fearing the darts at his back, and showing magnanimity amid this extremity of fate.
No sighing, no weeping, is there, and his grief is deserving of respect, its dignity preserved, such as, Magnus, it becomes thee to show for the woes of Rome.
With countenance not changed thou dost look upon Emathia;
neither shall the successes of war behold thee proud, nor its losses see thee dejected;
and as.
much as faithless Fortune has proved below thee when exulting in three triumphs, so much has she when unfor­ tunate.
Now, the weight of fate laid aside, free from care thou dost depart;
now thou hast leisure to look back upon joyous times;
hopes never to be fulfilled have gone;
what thou wast thou now hast the opportunity to know.
Fly from direful battles, and call the Gods to witness, that not one who continues in arms3 now, Magnus, dies for thee ;
just as Africa to be lamented with her reverses, and just as fatal Munda, and the carnage on the Pharian stream 1, so too, after thy departure is the greatest portion of the Thessaliam fight.
No longer now shall Pompey's name be revered by nations throughout the world, nor be the prompter of the war;
but the pair of rivals which we always have, will be Liberty and Cæsar;
and thyself ex­ pelled thence, the dying Senate shows that it was for itself it fought.
Driven afar, does it not give thee pleasure to have left the warfare, and not to have beheld those horrors, the troops drenched in gore ?
Look back upon the rivers clouded by the influx of blood, and have pity upon thy father-in-law.
With what breast shall he enter Rome, made more happy by these fields ?
Whatever, an exile alone in unknown regions, whatever, placed in the power of the Pharian tyrant, thou shalt en­ dure, believe the Gods, believe the lasting favour of the Fates, to conquer was still worse.
Forbid lamentations to resound, prevent the people from weeping;
forego tears and mourning.
As much shall the world venerate the woes of Pompey as his successes.
Free from care, with no sup­ pliant features behold potentates;
behold cities won by thee, and kingdoms bestowed, Ægypt and Libya, and select a re­ gion for thy death.
Larissa, as the first witness2 of thy downfall, beholds thy head, noble and unconquered by the Fates.
With all her citizens3 does she pour forth her entire strength through the walls;
weeping they send before to thee, as though suc­ cessful gifts to meet thee on thy way;
their temples, their houses they open ;
themselves they wish to be partners in thy reverses.
It is clear that much of thy illustrious name is left;
and less than thy former self alone, thou canst again urge all nations to arms, and again resort to the fatality of tear.
But, “What need has a conquered man of nations or of cities?" he says;
" put faith in the conqueror."
Thou, Cæsar, still on the high heap of carnage art wading amid the entrails of thy country;
but now does thy son-in-law present the nations unto thee1.
The charger bears Pompey away from there;
sighs and tears follow hint;
and many a rebuke of the multitude against the relentless Gods.
Now, Magnus, to thee is granted real experience of the love which thou didst seek, and its reward.
While prosperous one knows not that he is beloved2.
Cæsar, when he beheld that the fields had sufficiently overflowed with Hesperian blood, now thinking that he ought to spare the swords and the hands of his men, left the troops to live as though worthless lives, and about to perish for no purpose.
But, that the camp may not invite them back when routed, and rest by night dispel their fears, forth­ with he resolves to attack the entrenchments of the enemy, while Fortune waxes hot, while terror effects everything, not fearing lest this command may prove harsh to soldiers wearied and overpowered with the battle.
Through no great exhortation are the soldiers to be led to the plunder ;
­ "
Men, we have an abundant victory," says he;
"for our blood the reward is now remaining3, which it is my office to point out;
for I will not call it bestowing that which each one will give unto himself.
Behold, the camp, filled with all kinds of metal, is open;
here lies the gold torn from the Hesperian nations, and the tents are covering the treasures of the East.
The collected wealth of so many kings and of Magnus together, waits for possessors;
make haste, soldiers, to get before those whom you pursue;
and let the wealth be torn from the conquered which Pharsalia has made your own.
"And no more having said, he urged them on frantic and blinded with greed for gold, to rush over swords, and upon the carcases of parents, and to tread under foot the slaugh­ tered chieftains.
What trench, what rampart could with­ stand them seeking the reward of war and of crimes ?
On­ ward they flew to know for how great wages they had been guilty.
They found indeed, the world having been spoiled, full many a mass of bullion heaped up 1 for the expenses of the wars ;
but it did not satisfy minds craving for every­ thing.
Though they should seize whatever gold the Ibe­ rian digs up2, whatever the Tagus yields, whatever the enriched Arimaspian3 gathers from the surface of the sands, they will think that this criminality has been sold at a trifling price.
When the victor has bespoken for himself the Tarpeian towers 4, when he has promised himself every­ thing in hopes of the spoil of Rome, he is deceived in plundering a camp alone.
The unscrupulous commonalty take their slumbers upon the Patrician sods5;
the worthless private soldier presses the couches left empty by kings;
and on the beds of fathers, and on those of brothers the guilty men lay their limbs;
whom a frenzied rest, and frantic slumbers agitate;
wretched, they revolve the Thessalian combat in their breasts.
The ruthless bloodshed stands before them all in their sleep, and in all their thoughts they brandish arms, and, the hilt away, their hands are in motion.
You would suppose that the plains were groaning, and that the guilty earth had ex­ haled spirits, and that the whole air was teeming with ghosts, and the night above with Stygian horrors.
Of them, wretched men, does victory demand a sad retribution, and sleep presents hissings and flames1;
the shade of the slaugh­ tered fellow-citizen is there;
his own image of terror weighs heavy upon each.
This one sees the features of aged men, that one the figures of youths ;
another one do the carcases of brothers affright throughout all his slumbers;
in this breast is a father;
with Cæsar are the ghosts of all2.
No otherwise, not purified as yet at the Scythian altar3, did Orestes, descendant of Pelops, behold the features of the Eumenides;
nor, when Pentheus raved, or when Agave had ceased to rave 4, were they more sensible of astounding tumults in their minds.
Him do all the swords, which either Pharsalia has beheld or the day of vengeance is*des­ tined to behold, the Senate unsheathing them, upon that night oppress;
him do the monsters of hell scourge.
Alas!
how vast a punishment does his conscience-stricken mind inflict upon him in his wretchedness, in that, Pompey sur­ viving, he beholds Styx, in that he beholds the shades below, and Tartarus heaped upon him in his slumbers !
Still, having suffered all these things, after the bright day has unveiled to him the losses of Pharsalia, not at all does the aspect of the place call away his eyes riveted upon the fatal fields.
He beholds rivers swollen with gore, and he looks upon bodies equalling in heaps the lofty hills, and piles flattened down in corrupted gore, and he counts the people of Magnus2;
and that spot is made ready for a banquet, from which he may recognize their features and faces as they lie.
He is delighted not to see the Emathian ground, and to survey with his eyes the plains lying hid beneath the carnage;
in the blood does he behold For­ tune and the Gods of heaven his own.
And that in his fury he may not lose the joyous spectacle of his crimes, he denies the fires of the pile to the wretched slain, and exposes Emathia to a noisome atmo­ sphere.
Not him do the Carthaginian burier of the Consult and Cannæ, lighted up with the Libyan torch, instruct how to observe the customs of men with regard to his foes ;
but he remembers, his wrath not yet satiated with slaughter, that they were his own fellow-citizens.
Not individual graves, and separate funeral piles do we ask;
grant but one fire to whole nations ;
and in no distinct flames let the bodies be burned.
Or if vengeance on thy son-in-law pleases thee, heap up the groves of Pindus;
pile up the woods raised aloft with the oaks of Œta;
let Pompey from the main be­ hold the Thessalian flames.
Nought by this wrath dost thou avail;
whether putrefac­ tion, or whether the pile destroys the carcases, it matters not;
nature receives back everything into her placid bosom, and an end of themselves to themselves do the bodies owe.
These nations, Cæsar, if now the fire does not consume them, with the earth it will consume 1, with the waters of the deep it will consume.
One pile in common is left for the world 2, destined to mingle the stars with its bones.
Whithersoever Fortune shall summon thine own, thither these souls as well are wending.
Not higher than they shalt thou ascend into the air, not in a more favoured spot shalt thou lie beneath Stygian night.
Death is secure from Fortune;
the earth re­ ceives everything which she has produced;
he who has no urn is covered by the heavens.
Thou, to whom nations are paying the penalty by a death ungraced with burial, why dost thou fly from this slaughter ?
Why dost thou desert the carnage-smelling fields ?
Quaff these waters, Cfesar;
inhale, if thou canst, this air3.
But from thee do the putrefying nations snatch the Pharsalian fields, and, the victor put to flight, possess the plains.
Not only the Hæmonian, but the Bistonian wolves 4 came to the direful banquet of the war, and the lions left Pholoë, scenting the carnage of the bloody combat.
Then did bears desert their dens, obscene dogs their abodes and homes, and whatever besides with acute scent was sensible of the air impure and tainted by carrion.
And now the fowls of the air, that long had followed the civic warfare, flocked together.
You, birds, who are wont to change the Thracian winters for the Nile, departed later than usual2 for the balmy south.
Never with vultures so numerous did the heavens cover themselves, or did wings more numerous beat the air.
Every grove sent forth its fowls, and every tree dripped with gouts of gore from the blood-stained birds.
Full oft upon the features of the victor and the impious standards did either blood or corrupt matter flow down from the lofty sky, and from its now weary talons the bird threw down the limbs.
And thus, not all the people were reduced to bones, and, torn to pieces, disappeared in the beasts of prey;
the entrails within they cared not for, nor were they greedy to suck out all the marrow;
they lightly tasted of the limbs.
Loathed, the greatest part of the Latian multitude lay;
which the sun, and the showers, and lapse of time, mingled, when decomposed, with the Emathian earth.
Thessaly, unhappy land, with what guilt so great hast thou offended the Gods of heaven, that thee alone with deaths so numerous, with the fatal results of crimes so numerous, they should afflict ?
What length of time is suf­ ficient for forgetful antiquity to pardon thee the calamities of the warfare ?
What crop of corn will not rise discoloured with its tinted blade ?
With what ploughshare wilt thou not wound a Roman ghost ?
First shall fresh combats ensue 3, and for a second crime shalt thou afford the fields not yet dry from this bloodshed.
Should it be allowed us to over­ throw all the tombs of our ancestors, both the sepulchres that stand, and those which beneath the ancient roots4 have emptied their urns, their structures burst asunder;
ashes more numerous are ploughed up in the furrows of the Hæmonian earth, and more bones are struck against by the harrows that cultivate the fields.
No mariner would have loosened the cable from the Emathian shore, nor any ploughman have moved the earth, the grave of the Roman race;
the husbandmen, too, would have fled from the fields of the ghosts;
the thickets would have been without flocks;
and no shep­ herd would have dared to allow to the cattle the grass springing up from our bones;
and, as though uninhabitable by men either by reason of the tract of unendurable heat, or of freezing, bare and unknown thou wouldst have lain, if thou hadst not only first, but alone, been guilty of the criminality of the warfare.
0
Gods of heaven, be it allowed us to hate this hurtful land !
Why do ye render guilty1 the whole, why absolve the whole world?
The carnage of Hesperia, and the tearful wave of Pachynus, and Mutina, and Leucas, have rendered Philippi free from guilt.

He despatches Deiotarus to seek aid for his cause, 202-243.
And then sails past Ephesus, Samoa, Rhodes, Pamphylia, and Taurus, 244-255.
Arriving in Cilicia he addresses his companions, and recommends them to take refuge with Phraates, the king of Partbia, as he suspects the fidelity of the Egyp­ tians and Numidians, 256-327.
He is opposed by Lentulus, who advises him to take refuge with Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, 328-455.
He follows the advice of Lentulus, and proceeds to Pelusium, 456-466.
The ministers of Ptolemy are in trepidation, and deliberate what steps to take, 467-475.

By whose order it is embalmed, 687-691.
The Poet deplores the fate of Pompey, 692-711.
Cordus, an attendant of Pompey, burns the body on the shore, and bury­ ing the bones places over them a stone with an inscription, 712-793.
The Poet again laments his fate, and concludes with imprecations against treacherous Egypt, 794-872.
Now, beyond the vales of Hercules and the woody Tempo, seeking the desert by-paths of the Hæmonian wood2, Magnus, urging on the steed exhausted with the flight and refusing the spur, in his wanderings confuses the uncertain traces of his flight and the intricate paths.
He starts with fear at the sound of the groves moved by the winds;
and that of his own attendants, which readies him from behind, startles him, fearful and afraid that the enemy is at his side.
Although fallen from his lofty summit, he knows that not yet is the price of his blood valueless, and, mindful of his destiny, he believes that 1 he himself still possesses a life of value • as great as that which he himself would give for the torn-off head2 of Caesar.
As he followed the desert tracks the noble features of the hero did not allow him to conceal his station in a safe retreat.
Many, as they were repairing to the Pharsalian camp, rumour not as yet having disclosed his downfall, were astounded on meeting the chieftain a, at the mutations of events4;
and hardly was he himself a trustworthy inform­ ant on his own ruin.
Grievous is it to Magnus, whoever is the witness of his woes.
He would prefer to be unknown to all nations, and in safety to pass through the world with an obscure name ;
but Fortune.
demands from him in his affliction the punishment of her prolonged favours, who presses hard upon his adversity with the weight of a fame so great, and burdens him with his former lot.
Now is he sensible that honors were.
too much hastened for him, and he condemns the exploits in Sulla's day5 of his -laurel-crowned youth.
Now hurled down it grieves him .to recollect both the Corycian fleets1 and the Pontic standards2.
Thus does an age too lengthened destroy :
great spirits, and a life that survives empire.
Unless the .
last day comes with the end of our blessings, and antici­ pates sorrows by a speedy death, fortune is the prelude to disgrace.
Does any one dare to surrender himself to a prosperous lot, except on having prepared for death3 ?
He had reached the shore4, through which the river Peneus, now red with the Emathian carnage, discharged itself into the sea.
From there a bark, unsuited for the wind and waves, hardly safe on the shallows of a river, bore him, in trepidation, upon the deep.
He, with whose oars even yet Corcyra shakes5, and the Leucadian bays, -the master of the Cilicians and of the Liburnian land, stole away, a timid passenger, in a little boat.
Partner of his cares, thou didst bid him turn his sails towards the secret shores of Lesbos!
in which land at that time thou didst lie concealed, Cornelia, more sad than if thou wast .standing in the midst of the plains of Emathia.
Pre­ sages arouse sad anxieties;
thy slumber is convulsed by trembling fears;
Thessaly does each night present;
and, the shades departed, thou dost run along the crags of steep rocks and the verge of the shore, looking out upon the waves;
fluttering afar thou art always the first to behold the sails of the approaching ship, nor dost thou venture to make any enquiries about thy husband's fate.
Lo!
a bark, which spreads its canvas 1 towards your harbours !
what it is bringing thou knowest not;
and now, the sum of thy fears, a sad messenger of arms is come, and ill-boding report.
Thy vanquished husband is come.
Why dost thou lose the moments for grief ?
When now thou couldst be weeping, thou art stricken with fear.
Then, the ship drawing nigh, she leaps forward, and marks the cruel judgment of the Gods, the chieftain disfigured with pale­ ness, and having his countenance overhung with white hairs, and his garments squalid with black dust.
Darkness coming over her, afflicted, with its shades, takes away the heavens and the light, and grief besets her soul;
all her limbs, forsaken by their sinews, totter;
her heart grows contracted, and long does she lie deceived with the hope of death.
Now, the cable fastened to the shore, Pompey surveys the vacant sands.
After the faithful handmaids behold him close at hand, no further than silent sighs do they allow them- selves with which to rebuke the Fates, and in vain do they attempt to raise their lifeless mistress from the ground;
whom Magnus clasps to his breast, and with his embraces warms her enervated limbs.
The blood now recalled to the surface of her body, she had begun to feel the hands of Pompey, and to be able to meet the sad looks of her hus­ band;
Magnus forbids her to yield to fate, and with his voice reproves her immoderate grief:
­ “
Why, at the first wound of Fortune, dost thou fail in thy high-born courage, woman, rendered illustrious by the titles of ancestors so great1 ?
Thou hast a road to a fame destined to endure for ages.
In this sex of thine the sole ground for praise is not the enactment of laws, nor yet arms, but an unfortunate husband.
Elevate thy mind, and let thy duty struggle with destiny, and love myself because I have been conquered.
Now am I a still greater glory to thee, because the emblems of state2, and because the virtuous throng of Senators, and troops so vast of Kings, have departed from me.
Begin to be the only one to follow Magnus.
Misplaced the grief, which, while thy husband survives, is extreme, and forbidden is it to increase.
It ought to be thy last token of fidelity to mourn for thy husband.
In my warfare thou hast borne no losses.
After the battles Magnus still lives, but his fortunes have perished;
that which thou dost bewail, that alone hast thou loved.
"Rebuked by these words of her husband, with diffi­ culty she raised her weak limbs from the ground, with lamentations breaking forth into such complaints:
­ " 0 would that I had entered the marriage bed of hated Cresar, an unhappy wife, and joyous in no husband3!
Twice have I proved injurious to the world ;
Erinnys has conducted me as my bridal attendant 4, and the shades of the Crassi;
and devoted to those ghosts I have borne the disasters of Assyria to the civil warfare, and have hurled nations head­ long, and have scared all the Gods from the better cause.
O most famous husband, 0 thou, unworthy of my marriage '.bed, had Fortune this control over a head so mighty ?
Why impiously did I marry thee, if I was doomed to make thee wretched ?
Now take revenge, but such as I shall willingly submit to.
In order that the ocean may be more propitious -to thee, the fidelity of kings assured, and the whole world more hospitable, hurl me, thy partner, into the sea.
More do I wish that I had laid down this life for the fortune of arms ;
now at last, Magnus, expiate thy overthrow.
Wherever ruthless Julia, thou dost lie, having by civil strife taken vengeance upon my nuptials, do thou come hither and exact the penalty, and appeased, thy rival slain 2, spare thy Magnus."
Thus having said, and again sinking into the bosom of her husband, she melts the eyes of all to tears.
The heart of stem Magnus relents, and eyes that were dry in Thessaly.
does Lesbos fill..
Then does the multitude of Mitylene3 upon the thronged shore thus address Magnus:
— " If it shall always prove to us the greatest glory to have preserved the precious pledge of a husband so mighty, do thou, as well, we entreat, deign to grace for even one night the walls devoted to thee, by a sacred treaty, and our house­ hold Gods thy allies;
make this, Magnus, a place which all ages shall revisit, which the Roman stranger on coming shall venerate..
By thee vanquished, no walls ought in preference to be entered.
All places are able to hope for the favour of the conqueror;
this has already committed a crime.
And what if this lies, an island, on the sea?
Cæsar --is in want of ships.
A great part of thy nobles will collect here, as­ sured of thy locality.
Upon a known shore must the war be renewed.
Take the wealth of the Temples and the gold of the Gods;
if these youths are better suited for the land, if for ships, take them;
make use of all Lesbos, so far as it is of service.
Take them;
lest Cæsar should seize them, do thou, vanquished, accept them.
This charge alone do thou remove from a land that deserves well of thee, that thou .mayst not appear both to have obtained our alliance when fortunate, and to have repudiated it when unsuccessful.
"Glad in his adversity at such affection in these men, and rejoicing for the sake of the world that fidelity still exists, he says :
— ;
"
That there is no land in all the world more dear to me, J have shown to you by no slight pledge.
By this hostage did Lesbos retain my affection;
here was my hallowed home and my dear household Gods, here was Rome to me.
To no shores in my flight have I before this turned my ship, as I knew that Lesbos had already earned the wrath of Coosar, my wife being sheltered there, not having feared to entrust to you so great a ground for pardon2.
But now, sufficient is it to have rendered you guilty;
over the whole world my destinies must be pursued by me.
Alas !
too happy -Lesbos, with everlasting fame, whether thou dost teach nations and kings to receive Magnus, or whether thou alone dost show fidelity to me.
For I am resolved to seek in what lands there is righteousness, and where is guilt.
Re­ ceive, 0 Deity, if still thou art in any degree favourable to me, the extreme of my prayers:
grant me nations like to Lesbos who will not forbid me, subdued in war, Cæsar my foe, to enter their harbours, nor yet to leave them.
"He spoke, and he placed his sorrowing partner on.
board the ship.
You would have supposed that all were changing their land and their paternal soil;
in such a manner did they lament throughout all the shore, and reproaching right hands were extended to the skies;
and less for Pompey, whose fortunes had aroused their grief, but rather for her, whom, throughout the whole period of the war, they had looked on as their own fellow-citizen, did the people lament on be­ holding her depart;
whom hardly, if she'had been repairing to the camp of a victorious husband, could the matrons have now supposed to depart with dry eyes ;
with so great love had her virtue attached to her some, some her inte­ grity and the mo'desty of her chaste features, inasmuch as, humble in the extreme, a sojourner, cause of offence to not one of the multitude, she lived, her fortunes still erect, just as though her husband had been conquered.
Now Titan, sinking to his mid fires1 in the sea, was not entire to those from whom he conceals, nor to those to whom, if any, he discloses his orb ;
the watchful anxieties in Pompey's breast now revert to the allied cities of the Roman confederacy and the varying dispositions of kings, now to the remote regions of the world beyond oppressive suns extending, and the south.
Full oft the sad struggle of cares and a distrust in the future cast aside the wearying fluctuations of his undecided breast, and he consults the pilot of the ship about all the stars 2;
in which quarter he marks the land a;
what is his method of dividing the sea by the heavens ;
by means of what Constellation he makes for Syria, or which fire in the Wain4 rightly points to Libya.
To these words the skilled observer of the silent heavens1 makes answer:
­ "
The Constellations which fleet on in the star-bearing sky, deceiving wretched mariners, the heavens never standing still, we do not follow;
but that pole which never sets, most bright with the twofold Arctic guides the ships.
Here, al­ ways when the Lesser Bear rises vertically3 before me and stands over the summit of the ropes of the mainmast yards 4 then do we look towards the Bosporus and the sea that winds along the shores of Scythia.
Is Arctophylax descending 5 at all from the summit of the mast, and is the Cynosure brought nearer to the sea, then is the bark making to­ wards the harbours of Syria.
Then does Canopus receive us6, a star content to wander in the southern sky, dreading Boreas:
speed onward with it also to the left, beyond Pha­ ros, the bark in the mid sea will touch the Syrtes.
But in what direction dost thou command the sails to be set, in what the canvas to be now spread with the sheet ?
"To him, on the other hand, with doubting breast Mag­ nus answered :
-"
Observe this alone throughout the whole ocean, that thy bark is always afar from the Ema­ thian shores, and leave Hesperia to the sea and sky;
leave the rest to the winds.
My partner and deposited pledge have I regained;
then was I assured what shores I desired;
now Fortune will provide a harbour.
"Thus he speaks;
but he turns the sails hanging in equal degree from the level ends of the sailyards, and guides the ship to the left, and that he may cleave the waves which the Samian rocks and which Chios renders rugged, these ropes he loosens at the prow, those he tightens1 at the stern.
The seas are sensible of the change, and now, the beak in another direction'cleaving the deep, and the bark not look­ ing the same way, they change their sound.
Not so dexter­ ously does the guide of the horses, when he sweeps round the left end of the axle 2.with the right-hand wheel, force the chariot to keep close to the turning-place untouched 3.
Titan has now disclosed the earth and concealed the stars.
Each one dispersed by the Emathian storms, follows after Magnus4, and first from the shores of Lesbos his son comes to meet him5, and then a faithful band of nobles.
For not from Magnus when hurled down by the Fates and worsted in fight, has Fortune taken kings as his attend- ants;
an exile, he has the rulers of the earth and those who wield the sceptres of the East as his companions.
He bids Deiotarus1, who follows the flying track of his leader, go to the remote regions of the world.
"Since," says he, "most faithful of kings, the earth, wherever it is Roman, has been lost by the Emathian defeat, it remains for us to try the fidelity of the East, and the nations that drink of Euphrates, and Tigris still safe from Cæsar.
Object not, seeking the destinies of Magnus, to penetrate to the remote abodes of the Medians and the Scythian retreats, and to change the entire clime, and to carry my words to the proud descendant of Arsaces 2."
If your ancient treaties with me are still in force, sworn unto me by the Thunderer of Latium, ratified by your ma­ gicians 3, fill your quivers, and stretch the Armenian bows with Getan strings;
if, you, 0 Parthians, when I sought the Caspian strongholds, and pursued the hardy Alani with their eternal wars, permitting you to range at large in the Achæmenian plains5, I never drove trembling in flight to well defended Babylon.
Beyond the realms of Cyrus, and the confines of the Chaldæan sway, where the rapid Ganges and where the Nysrean Hydaspes6 approach the sea, nearer was I then to the fires of rising Phcebus than Persia was;
still, subduing all places, I endured that yourselves alone1 should be wanting to my triumphs;
and alone in the number of kings of Eastern lands does the Parthian approach me on equal terms.
Nor once do the descendants of Arsaces stand saved by the favour of Magnus.
For. who was it that, after the wounds of the Assyrian slaughter, restrained the just wrath of Latium2?
Bound by so many obligations to me, now let Parthia, the limits burst open3, pass beyond the banks forbidden for ages, and the Zeugma of him of Pella.
Conquer for Pompey, ye Parthians;
Rome will be ready to be con­ quered.
'"The King does not hesitate to obey him commanding an enterprise so difficult;
and, the insignia of the palace laid aside5, he goes forth, clad in the assumed garb of a menial.
In doubtful enterprises it is safe for the monarch to counterfeit the needy man.
How much more securely, then, does the man who is truly poor pass his life than the rulers of the world!
The king having been dismissed upon the shore, he himself amid the rocks of Icaria1, leaving behind both Ephesus, and Colophon with its tranquil seas, skims past the foaming rocks of little Samos3;
the floating breeze blows off from the shores of Cos4;
next does he fly past Cnidos5 and leave Rhodes behind, made illustrious by the sun6, and by the mid-sea7 he cuts short the great bays of the Telmessian waves8.
The Pamphylian land presents itself to the ship;
and not as yet venturing to entrust himself to any walls, to thee, little Phaselis, does Magnus first repair.
For thee thy' scanty inhabitants forbid to be distrusted, and thy homes exhausted of their people;
and greater is the mul­ titude in the ship than thine.
Hence, again spreading the canvas, now he beholds Taurus, and Dipsus, that flows down from Taurus'.
Could Magnus have believed this 2, that when he gave.
peace to the waves provision was made for himself as well ?
Safe, in his little bark he flies along the shores of the Cili­ cians.
A great part of the Senate, collected, overtakes the flying chieftain;
and at little Celendræ 3, at which port Se­ linus both sends forth and receives its ships, in an assembly of the nobles, at length does Magnus open his sorrowing lips, in these words “
Companions in the war and in my flight, and dear as my native land, although on a naked shore, in the region of the Cilicians, and surrounded by no arms, I take counsel, and consider of a commencement for a new career, still, do you bring courageous spirits.
Not utterly have I fallen on the fields of Emathia, nor so far are my destinies depressed that .I..am not able to raise my head again, and shake off the reverse I have sustained.
Were the ruins of Libya able to elevate Marius1 to the Consular dignity2 and restore him .to the filled annals a, and me shall Fortune keep depressed by a lighter hand?
A thousand ships of mine4 are tossed upon'the Grecian seas, a thousand captains;
rather does Pharsalia disperse our resources, than subvert them."
But me even the fame alone of my exploits is able to protect, which throughout the whole earth I have achieved, and a name which the world loves.
Do you.
weigh these :
realms 5, both as to their strength and their fidelity—Libya, and the Parthians, and Pharos—which of them ought to succour the Roman state.
But I, nobles, will disclose the secrets of my cares, and in which direction the prepon­ derance of my thoughts inclines.
The age of the monarch of the Nile" is suspected by me, because strict fidelity de­ mands ripened years..
On the other hand the two-faced subtlety of the doubtful Moor alarms me;
, for, mindful :
of his race, the ruthless descendant of Carthage7 longs for Hesperia, and much of Hannibal is in his fickle breast.
He who defiles his kingdom with.
collateral bloody and reaches up to Numidian forefathers, has now become puffed up with pride, on Varus being a suppliant1, and has looked upon the destinies of Rome in a secondary rank."
Come, then, my companions, let us hasten to the Eastern climes.
Euphrates with his tide divides the vast earth, and the Caspian strongholds set apart boundless re­ treats, and another pole measures the Assyrian nights and days, and a sea of different colour2 in its waves is severed from ours, and an ocean their own.
Their sole desire is rule3.
More lofty is the war-horse in the plains, and more strong their bow;
neither boy nor aged man is slow to stretch the deadly string, and from no arrow is death matter of uncertainty.
They were the first with the bow to repulse the lances of Pella 4;
and Bactria, the abode5 of the Medians, and Babylon, proud of its walls 6, the home of the Assyrians."
Nor yet are our javelins much feared by the Parthians;
and they dare to engage in war, having made trial of the Scythian arrows, when Crassus died.
Nor do they scatter darts that trust in iron alone, but the whizzing shafts are steeped in plenteous venom.
Small wounds are fatal, and there is death in the blood on the surface of the skin.
Oh!
would that I had not dependence so great upon the ruthless descendants of Arsaces!
Destinies too strongly rivalling our own destinies influence the Medians, and greatly do the Gods favour the race1."
Nations will I pour forth summoned from other lands ;
and the East will I send against him, awakened from its retreats.
But if Eastern faith and barbarian confede­ racies betray us, let Fortune bear our wreck beyond the intercourse of the ordinary world.
I will not go suing to realms which I have created;
but I shall enjoy a great solace in my death, as I lie in another clime, that nothing to these limbs my father-in-law has done with bloody, nothing with pious intent.
But revolving all the destinies of my life, always was I venerated in that part of the world.
Be­ yond Mæotis how mighty2!
How mighty at Tanais, in the sight of the whole East!
Into what lands did my name make its way with deeds more glorious, or whence with greater triumphs did it return ?"
Rome, favour my purpose;
for what could the Gods of heaven ever grant to thee more welcome than for thee to wage the civil war with Parthian troops, and to overthrow a nation so mighty, and to confound it with our woes ?
When the arms of Cæsar shall engage with the Medians, it follows that Fortune must avenge either me or the Crassi.
"Thus having said, he perceives by the murmurs that the men disapprove of his plans;
all of whom Lentulus exceeded in his incentives to valour and in the dignity of his grief, and uttered words worthy of one so late a Consul :
­ "
Have the Thessalian reverses so far impaired thy mind?
Has a single day sealed the destinies of the world ?
Is a contest so mighty decided1 . by Emathia?
Does all aid lie prostrate for this blood-stained wound?
Has Fortune left to thee, Magnus, the feet of the Parthians alone 2?
Why, flying through the world, abhorring the entire regions of our earth 3 and our sky, dost thou seek the opposite poles and remote stars, about to venerate Chaldæan Gods, and barbarian rites4, a servant of the Parthians?
Why is the love of liberty5 the pretext alleged for our arms?
Why dost thou deceive the wretched world, if thou canst be a slave?
Thee, whom, he dreaded to hear of when ruling the Roman state, whom he beheld leading captured kings from the Hyrcanian woods 6, and from the Indian shores, shall he behold cast down by the Fates, humble and abject, and madly raise his aspirations for the Latian world, Pompey his suppliant, measuring himself and Rome together ?“
Thou wilt be able to say nothing worthy of thy spirit and thy destiny.
Ignorant of.
converse in the Latin tongue, he will:
demand, Magnus, that thou shouldst ask him by tears.
Are we to endure this wound on our shame, that Parthia shall avenge the woes of Hesperia, before Rome does her own?
Thyself it was she chose as her chieftain in the civil strife.
Why dost thou spread our wounds among the Scythian tribes, and our slaughters that at present lie concealed?
Why dost thou teach the Parthians to come beyond ?
Rome loses thereby the solace of woes so great in bringing in no kings, but becoming the slave of her own citizen.
"Does it give thee delight to go throughout the world leading savage nations against the walls of Rome, and fol­ lowing standards from the Euphrates, captured with the Crassi2 ?
He who alone among the kings, who, while For­ tune concealed her preference, was wanting to Emathia3, will he now challenge the resources so mighty of him heard of as the conqueror, or be ready, .Magnus, to unite his fortunes with thee ?
Not this trustworthiness is there in the race."
Every nation which is born amid the Arctoan frosts is unsubdued in war and a lover of death.
Whatever glides towards the Eastern lands and the warm regions of the world, the mildness of the climate makes the nations effeminate.
There do you behold both the flowing vest­ ments1 and the loose coverings of the men.
The Parthian amid the Median fields, upon the Sarmatian plains and the lands of Tigris extending with level track, is conquer.
able by no enemy in his powers of flight;
but where the earth swells he will not ascend the rugged mountain ridges;
nor will he wage the warfare in darkening shades, weak with his uncertain bow, nor by swimming cleave the current with its strong eddies ;
nor, besprinkled in battle over all his limbs with blood, will he endure the summer's sun be­ neath the heated dust.
No battering-rams have they, no engines of war;
they are not able to fill up trenches;
and, the Parthian pursuing, whatever shall be able to resist the arrow, that same shall prove a wall2."
Skirmishing are their battles, and flying their fights, and straggling their squadrons, and more skilled are the troops at giving way than at repulsing.
Steeped are their weapons with treachery, nor have they valour ever to endure the com­ bat hand to hand, but rather to stretch the strings of their bows from afar, and to leave their wounds to the winds, wherever they choose to carry them.
The sword requires strength, and every nation that exists of men wages the warfare with the sword;
but the Medians the first onset disarms, and their emptied quivers bid them retreat.
No confidence have they in their hands, in poison is it all."
Dost thou, Magnus, deem those to be men for whom it is too little to come to the hazard of the battle with the sword?
Is it so greatly worth thy while to try a disgraceful aid, that, separated from thy country by the whole world, thou mayst die ?
Is barbarian earth to press upon thee ?
Is a little and a homely tomb to cover thee, matter of envy still, while Crassus wants a sepulchre 1.
But lighter is thy lot, since death is the extreme punishment, and one not to be feared by men."
But Cornelia dreads not death 2 alone under a wicked king.
Is the barbarian lust unknown to us, which blindly, after the manner of wild beasts, pollutes the laws and the compacts of the marriage tie with wives innumerable?
The secrets, too, of the unrighteous bed lie there ex­ posed.
Amid a thousand wives, royalty, maddened with revelry and with wine, abhors not any intercourse3 inter­ dicted by the laws;
amid the embraces of women so many one night wearies not one man.
Sisters lie in the beds of brothers, the sacred ties of mothers, as well.
The woful story among nations condemns Thebes, stained by Œdipus 4, for a crime not voluntarily committed;
how often is the Parthian ruler, descended from Arsaces, born of blood thus mixed!
To him to whom it is lawful to unite with a parent, what can I deem to be unlawful ?
'The progeny so illustrious of Metellus' will be standing, the thousandth wife, at a barbarian couch, although, Magnus, to no woman will royal lust more readily devote itself than to her when cruelty stimulates it, and the titles of her husbands"."
For, in order that still more portents may delight the Parthian, he will know that she was the wife of Crassus too;
as though owed already to the Assyrian destinies, she is dragged along, the captive of the former overthrow1.
Let the woful wound to our eastern destinies be impressed upon thee;
not only to have asked aid from the ruthless king, but to have waged civil war before that thou wilt be ashamed.
For what crime among nations of thy father-in-law and of thyself will be greater, than that, you engaging in arms, vengeance for the Crassi has been lost ?
All the chieftains ought to have rushed to attack Bactria;
and no arms should have been spared, even to laying bare the northern sides of OUT empire to the Dacians2 and the bands of the Rhine, until perfidious Suso 3, falling upon the tombs of the heroes 4, and Babylon, had lain prostrate."
An end, Fortune, do we pray for, to the Assyrian peace ;
and if the civil war of Thessaly has terminated, against the Parthians let him, who has proved the victor, go.
It is the only nation of the world at a triumph over whom by Cœsar I could rejoice.
Will not, when first thou shalt pass over the cold Araxes, the shade of the sorrowing old man5, transfixed with the Scythian arrows, utter these words to thee:
' Dost thou, whom we hoped for as the avenger of the ashes of our unburied ghosts 6, come for treaties and for peace?'
Then will many a memorial of the slaughter meet thee;
the walls which the decapitated chieftains surveyed1, where Euphrates overwhelmed names so mighty, and Tigris threw our carcases on shore, and then took them back to himself 2.“
If, Magnus, thou art able to submit to these things, thou art able also to appease thy father-in-law, paramount in the midst of Thessaly.
Why dost thou not look upon the Roman world ?
If thou dost dread the realms situate beneath the south, and the faithless Juba, we repair to Pharos3 and the fields of Lagus.
On the one side Egypt is safe in the.
Libyan Syrtes;
then, on the other, the rapid stream dis­ turbs the sea by its seven mouths.
It is a land contented with its own blessings, not standing in need of merchan­ dize or of showers 4;
in the Nile alone is its trust.
The boy Ptolemy wields a sceptre, Magnus, owed to thee;
!, entrusted to thy guardianship.
Who should dread the mere shadow of a name?
His age is free from guile 6;
hope for neither jus- tice and honor, nor reverence for the Gods in an aged court.
Those used to the sceptre are ashamed of nothing;
mildest is the lot of realms under a youthful king."
No more having said, he inclined their minds in that direction.
How much freedom does the last hope of success obtain!
The opinion of Magnus was overruled.
Then did they leave the territory of the Cilicians, and urge on their hastening barks to Cyprus, to which no altars has the Goddess preferred, remembering the Paphian waves 1, if we are to believe that the Deities have birth, or it is right to suppose that any one of the Gods has had a beginning.
When Pompey has departed from these shores, coasting along all the rocks of Cyprus, in which it projects towards the south, thence is he turned aside 2 by the obliquely-flowing tides of the vast ocean ;
nor does he make for the mountain cheering at night with its light3;
and, with struggling sails, with difficulty he reaches the lower shores of Egypt, where the largest portion of the divided Nile, the seventh channel, flows into the Pelusian fords4.
It was the time at which the Balance poises1 the level hours, but equal on not more than a single day, and then the decreasing light pays back to the winter nights a consolation for their losses in the spring.
When he understood that the King was staying at Mount Casius2 he changed his course;
as yet neither was Phœbus gone down, nor did the sails flag3.
Now with rapid speed along the shore the horsemen scouts4 had filled the trem­ bling court with the arrival of the stranger.
Hardly was there time for counsel;
still, all the miscreants of the Pel­ læan household5 met together;
among whom, Achoreus 6, now calmed by old age and more moderate through bending years (to him Memphis gave birth, frivolous in her rites7, the observer of the Nile8 increasing upon the fields;
he the worshipper of the Gods, not one Apis only had lived9 through the changes of his moon), was the first speaker in the council;
and he alleged the merits and the fidelity of Pompey, and the sacred ties of the deceased parent' of Ptolemy.
But more skilled in persuading the ill-disposed, and in understanding tyrants, Pothinus, presuming to con­ demn Pompey to death, thus said:
­ " Justice and right, Ptolemy, have rendered many a one guilty'.
Fidelity, bepraised as it is, pays the penalty when it upholds those whom Fortune depresses.
Concur with the Fates and the Gods, and pay court to the fortunate;
fly from the wretched.
As different as are the stars from tho earth, as the flames from the sea, so is the profitable from the right.
The entire power of sceptres perishes if it begins to weigh what is just;
and regard for what is honorable over­ throws citadels.
It. is the liberty to commit crimes which protects a hated sway, and all restraint removed from the sword.
Everything may you do in cruelty with no impunity, except when you dare to do it.
Let him who wishes to be virtuous remove from a court.
Goodness and supreme power do not agree together;
he will be always afraid whom cruelty shall shame.
Not with impunity let Magnus have despised thy years, who thinks that thou art not able to drive away even the vanquished from our shores."
Nor let-a stranger deprive thee of thy sceptre;
nearer pledges hast thou;
if.
thou art tired of reigning, yield up Nile and Pharos to thy condemned sister3.
Let us at least protect Egypt from Latian arms.
Whatever has not be- longed to Magnus, while the war was being waged1, will not belong to the conqueror.
Now from the whole world expelled, after there is no confidence remaining in his fortunes, he seeks a nation with which to fall;
he is distracted by the ghosts of fellow-citizens.
And not only from the arms of his father-in-law does he fly;
from the faces of the Senate he is flying, of whom a great part is gorging the Thessalian birds2;
he dreads the nations, too, whom, mingled in one carnage, he has abandoned;
kings, also, does he fear, all of whose fortunes he has ruined;
guilty, too, of Thessaly, in no land received, he appeals to.
our land, which not as yet he has betrayed.
"A more just cause of complaint, Ptolemy, has been given to us against Magnus.
Why dost thou stain a with the crimes of war Pharos distant and ever at repose, and why make our lands suspected by the conqueror?
Why has this region alone pleased thee, on thy fall, upon which to bring the fortunes of Pharsalia and thy own punishment ?
Already do we incur a blame4, to be wiped away with the sword, in that on us, at thy persuasion, the Senate conferred the sceptre.
By our wishes we have encouraged thy arms.
This sword, which the Fates bid us unsheathe, I have pro­ vided, not for thee, but for the conquered one.
Magnus, thy vitals I will pierce;
those of thy father-in-law I could have preferred.
Whither everything is being borne3, we are hurried on.
Dost thou have a doubt whether it is necessary for me to destroy thee while yet I may ?
What confidence in our kingdom brings thee hither, unhappy man?
Dost thou not behold our people unarmed, and, the Nile receding, hardly able to dig the softened fields ?
It is right to take measure of one's kingdom, and to confess one's strength.
Art thou, Ptolemy, able to support the downfall of Magnus, beneath which Rome lies prostrate ?
Dost thou presume to stir the graves and the ashes of Thessaly, and to summon war against thy realms ?
Before the Emathian combat with no arms did we side;
is the camp of Pompey now to please thee, which the whole earth forsakes ?
Dost thou now provoke the resources of the victor and destinies that have been ascertained ?
It befits not to desert in adversity, but it so befits those who have attended upon the prosperity.
No fidelity ever made choice of unfortunate friends.
"All assent to the villany.
The boy king rejoices at the unusual honor, that now his servants allow matters of such importance to be entrusted to him.
For the crime Achillas is chosen.
Where the perfidious land1 projects in the Casian sands, and the Egyptian shallows attest the adjoining Syrtes, he provides a little bark, with companions for the monstrous crime 2, and with swords.
0 Gods of heaven!
have Nile and barbarian Memphis and the multitude so effeminate of Pelusian Canopus' such a disposition as this ?
Does civil strife thus depress the world ?
Do the Roman fortunes thus he prostrate ?
Is there any room left for Egypt in these disasters, and is the Pharian sword introduced?
At least, ye civil wars, preserve this fidelity;
afford kindred hands4, and drive afar misdeeds committed by foreign hands, if, with a name so illustrious Magnus has deserved to be the ground for Cæsar's crimes.
Dost thou not dread, Ptolemy, the downfall of a name so great?
The heavens, too, thundering1, dost thou, impure one and but half a man2, presume to interpose thy profane hands ?
Not that he was the subduer of the world, and not that he was thrice borne in his chariot3 to the Capitol, the ruler, too, of kings, the avenger of the Senate, and the son- in-law of the conqueror;
what might have been for a Pharian tyrant enough, he was a Roman.
Why dost thou lay open our entrails with the sword ?
Thou knowest not, dishonor­ able boy, thou knowest not, in what position thy fortunes are 4;
now without any right dost thou wield the sceptre of the Nile;
in civil fight has he fallen who gave to thee thy realms.
Now had Magnus denied his sails to the wind, and by the aid of oars5 was making for the accursed shores;
to meet whom, borne in a two-oared boat, not long the wicked band pushed on;
and pretending that the realms of Pharos lie open to Magnus, bade him come from the prow of the lofty ship into the little bark, and censured the unfavourable shore, and the tides from the two seas' upon the shoals that break them, which forbid foreign fleets to approach the land.
And had not the laws of the Fates, and the approach of a wretched death destined by the command of an eternal ordination, forced Magnus, condemned to destruction, unto the shore, to no one of his attendants were wanting omens of the crime;
for, if their fidelity had been unstained, if the palace had been with true good feeling open to Magnus, the giver of the sceptre, it was clear that the Pharian monarch would have come, together with all his fleet.
But he yields to his destiny;
and, bidden to leave his fleet, he obeys, and delights to prefer death to fear.
Cor­ nelia was going straightway into the enemy's ship, through this more impatient at being absent from her departing husband because she apprehended calamity.
"
Stay behind, daring wife," said he, " and thou, son, I pray, and afar from the shore await my fate;
and upon this neck make trial of the fidelity of the tyrant.
"But towards him, thus harshly refusing, frantic Cornelia extended her two hands3.
“Whither, cruel one," she said, " dost thou depart without me ?
Am I left again, removed afar from the Thessalian woes1?
Never with joyous omens are we wretched persons severed asunder.
Couldst thou not have guided thy ship elsewhere when thou didst
By, and have left me in the retreats of Lesbos, if thou didst intend to drive me away from all lands ?
Or do I only please thee as thy companion upon the waves ?"
When in vain, she had poured forth these words, still in her anxiety did she hang over the end of the stern;
and with astounded fear neither was she able in any direction to turn her eyes away, nor yet to look on Magnus.
The fleet stands anxious upon the fate of the chieftain, fearing not arms and crime, but lest with submissive prayers Pompey should venerate the sceptre presented by his own hands.
As he is preparing to pass on board, Septimius, a Roman soldiery salutes him from the Pharian ship;
who (oh shame to the Gods of heaven!), the javelin laid aside3, as a body-guard was bearing the disgraceful weapons of .royalty;
fierce, violent, unrelenting, and less inclined to carnage than no one of the wild beasts.
Who, Fortune, may not suppose that thou didst spare the nations, in that this right hand was wanting in the war, and that thou didst drive afar from Thessaly weapons so baneful ?
Thou dost so dispose the swords, alas !
that in no quarter of the world a civil crime may not be perpetrated for thee.
ITo the victors themselves a disgrace, and a tale never to be free from shame to the Gods of heaven:
thus did a Roman sword obey a king;
and the Pellæan boy, Magnus, cut thy throat with a sword thy own.
With what character shall posterity hand down Septimius to future ages ?
By what name shall they speak of this crime who have pro­ nounced that of Brutus a wickedness ?
Now had arrived the period of his closing hour, and borne off in the Pharian boat he had now lost the disposal of him­ self.
Then did the royal miscreants prepare to unsheathe their swords2.
When he beheld their weapons closing upon him, he covered up his features, and, disdaining to expose to Fortune his bared head, then did he close his eyes, and hold his breath, that he might be able to utter no words and spoil his eternal fame by lamentations.
But after the murderous Achillas had pierced his side with his pointed weapon, with not a groan he submitted to the stroke 3, and despised the villany, and kept his body unmoved, and proved himself when dying to be Pompey, and revolved these things in his breast:
­ " Ages, never to be silent, wait upon the woes of Rome.
and generations to follow look from the whole earth upon this bark and the Pharian faith.
Now think upon thy fame.
The prospering fortunes of a lengthened life have flowed on for thee.
Nations know not, if at thy death thou dost not prove it, whether thou dost know how to endure adversity.
Give way to no shame, nor grieve at the author of thy fate.
By whatever one thou art smitten, think it the hand of thy father-in-law.
Though they should rend and tear me, still, 0 Gods of heaven, I am happy, and no God has the power to deprive me of that.
The prosperity of my life is changed;
through death a person does not become wretched.
Cornelia beholds this murder and my Pompey.
So much more patiently, grief, restrain thy sighs, I entreat;
my son and my wife truly love me, if they admire me in my death.
”
1Such was the self-possession of the mind of Magnus;
this power had he over his dying spirit.
But Cornelia, not so well able to behold the ruthless crime as to endure it with courage, fills the air with lament­ able words:
"0 husband, I, wicked that I am, have mur­ dered thee;
the cause of the fatal delay to thee was Lesbos so remote thy course, and Cæsar has arrived the first2 at the shores of the Nile.
For who else had the right to commit the crime?
But thou, whoever thou art, sent down, by the Gods of heaven against that life, having a view either to Cæsar's wrath, or to thyself, knowest not, cruel one, where are the vitals themselves of Magnus ;
thou dost hasten and redouble thy blows, where such is the wish of the vanquished.
Let him pay a penalty not less than death, and first let him behold my head cut off.
Not free can I from the fault of the warfare, who alone of the matrons, an attendant on the waves and in the camp, scared away by no fatalities, sheltered him conquered, which even monarchs feared to do.
Have I, husband, deserved this, to be left in safety in the ship ?
Perfidious one, didst thou spare me ?
Thou coming to thy latest hour, have I been deserving of life?
I will die, and that not by the favour of the king.
Either, sailors, allow me a headlong leap, or to place the halter and the twisted ropes around my neck;
or let some companion worthy of Magnus provide a sword.
For Pompey he may do that which he may lay to the charge of the arms of Cæsar.
0 cruel men, do ye restrain me hurrying on to my fate ?
Still, husband, thou dost survive, and now, Magnus, Cornelia has not the disposal of herself.
They hinder me from hastening on my death;
for the conqueror I am reserved.
"Thus having said, and having fallen into the arms of her friends, she was carried off, the alarmed ship hastening away.
But when the back and the breast of Magnus resounded with the sword, those who beheld the lacerated head con­ fess that the majestic gracefulness of his hallowed form still remained, and that his features were angered at the Gods, and that the last moments of death changed nothing of the mien and features of the hero.
But ruthless Septimius in this act of villany invents a villany still greater;
and, the covering cut asunder1, he uncovers the sacred features of the half-dead Magnus, and lays hold of the breathing head, and places the languid neck crosswise upon a bench.
Then he cuts the nerves and veins, and is long in breaking the knotty bones;
not as yet was it an art to whip off a head with the sword..
But after the neck, divided, shrunk back from the trunk, the Pharian courtier a claimed to carry this in his right hand.
Roman soldier, degenerate and playing a second part4, dost thou with the ruthless sword cut off the sacred head of Pompey, not to bear it away thyself ?
0 fate, treated with extreme indignity!
That the impious boy may recognize Magnus, that flowing hair revered by kings, and the long locks graceful with his noble forehead are seized by the hand, and while the features are alive, and the sobs of the breath are moving the mouth to murmurs, and while the unclosed eyes are stiffening, the head is fixed on a Pharian pear5, which when ordering war never was there peace;
this it was that swayed the laws, and the Plain 1, and the Rostra;
with this face, Fortune of Rome, didst thou gratify thyself.
Nor enough was it for the disgraceful tyrant to have beheld this;
he wished a memorial to survive the crime.
Then, by an accursed art2, the moisture was extracted from the head, and, the brains removed, the skin was dried, and the putrid juices flowed forth from within, and the head was hardened by drugs poured into it.
Last offspring of the race of Lagus3, and about to perish, degenerate, and destined to yield to the rule of thy unchaste sister4;
whilst by thee the Macedonian is preserved" in the sacred vaults, and with mountains piled over them, the ashes of kings are at rest, while the Pyramids6 and Mau­ solean graves, unworthy of them, enclose the shades of the Ptolemies and their abandoned line, are the shores to be beating against Pompey, and is the trunk to be tossed to and fro by the waves on the shoals ?
Was it so burden­ some a care to save the corpse entire for the father-in-law ?
Fortune with this fidelity ended the fates of Magnus so prosperous;
with this death did she hurl him down from the highest summit of power, and cruelly centred all the calamities in one day, from which she granted him years so many of freedom ;
and Pompey was one who never saw joys mingled with sorrows;
happy in no one of the Gods molesting him, and wretched in no one sparing him.
Once for all with delaying hand did Fortune hurl him down.
He is beaten to and fro on the sands, he is mangled on the rocks, the waves received into his wounds, the sport of the ocean;
and, no figure remaining, the only mark of Magnus is the loss of the head torn off.
Still, before the conqueror touched upon the Pharian sands, Fortune suddenly provided for Pompey a tomb, lest he might lie in none, or lest in a better sepulchre.
From his hiding-place Cordus, trembling1, runs down to the sea- shore.
The seeker had been the unhappy attendant2 of Magnus from the Idalian shores3 of Cyprus, the abode of Cinyras.
He amid the shades daring to move his steps, repressed his fear, overcome by affection, that he might bring the body, sought in the midst of the waves, to land, and draw Magnus to the shore.
But little light does sor­ rowing Cynthia afford amid the thickening clouds;
but the trunk, of different colour from the hoary sea, is perceived.
He seizes the chieftain in his strict embrace, as the sea drags him away;
now overpowered by a burden so vast he awaits the waves, and, the sea aiding him, moves on the corpse.
After he has now seated himself upon the dry shore, he leans over Magnus, and pours forth his tears into every wound, and to the Gods of heaven and the darkened stars he says:
­ “ Thy Pompey, Fortune, asks not a sepulchre precious with heaped-up frankincense1;
not that the unctuous smoke may bear eastern odours from his limbs unto the stars;
that duteous necks of Romans may bear:
!
their pa­ rent, that the funereal procession should carry before it his ancient triumphs, that with the song of sorrow the market-places may re-echo 3;
that the whole army, grieving, may go round the flames with arms reversed 4.
Grant to Magnus the lowly coffin 5 of the plebeian funeral, which may lower his torn corpse into the dry flames 6. Let not wood be wanting for him ill-fated, nor yet a humble burner.
Be it enough, 0 Gods of heaven, that Cornelia does not lie prostrate, with flowing locks, and, embracing her husband, command the torch to be applied, but, unhappy wife, is absent from the last rites of the tomb, and still is not far distant from the shore.
"Thus having said, afar the youth beholds a little fire, with no watcher, burning a body 1, unregarded by its friends.
Thence he bears off the flames, and taking the half-burnt wood from beneath the limbs, he says:
“ Whoever thou art, neglected ghost, and dear to no friend of thine, but more happy than Pompey, grant pardon that now a strangers hand despoils thy constructed pyre.
If there is any sense left after death, thou thyself dost yield up thy funeral pile, and dost submit to this spoiling of thy tomb, and dost feel ashamed for thee to burn the shades of Pompey, scattered abroad.
"Thus does he speak, and with his bosom filled with the burning embers he flies away to the trunk, which, almost carried back by the waves, is hovering on the edge of the shore.
He moves away the surface of the sands, and, trem­ blin- places in the little trench the fragments collected from afar of a vessel broken up.
No oaken beams press upon the noble corpse, upon no built-up wood do the limbs recline;
applied, not placed beneath, the fire receives Mag­ nus.
Sitting near the flames, he said:
“ 0 greatest chieftain, and sole glory of the Hesperian name, if more sad to thee this pile than the tossing on the deep, if more sad than no funereal rites, withdraw thy shade and thy mighty spirit from my duteous offices.
The injustice of Fate declares this to be right;
lest a monster of the sea, lest a wild beast, lest the birds, lest the wrath of cruel Cæsar should venture aught, accept, so far as thou canst, these flames, thus burnt by a Roman hand.“
If Fortune should grant me a return to Hesperia, not in this spot shall ashes so sacred repose;
but, Magnus, Cornelia shall receive thee, and by my hand transfer thee to the urn.
In the meantime let me mark the shore with a little stone, that there may be a memorial of thy grave;
if any one, perchance, should wish to appease thee thus cut off, and to render the full rites clue to death, he may find the ashes of thy trunk, and may know the sands to which, Magnus, he is to bring back thy head.
"Thus having said, with fuel heaped on he arouses the sluggish flames.
Magnus is consumed, and disappears in the fire slowly burning, with his moisture feeding the pile.
But now the day had dimmed the stars, the harbingers of dawn;
he, the ceremonial of the funeral interrupted, alarmed, seeks his hiding-place upon the shore.
What pu­ nishment, simple man, dost thou dread for this crime, for which loud-mouthed fame has taken charge of thee for all years to come ?
The unnatural father-in-law, even, will com­ mend the burial of the bones of Magnus;
only go, secure of pardon, and disclosing the sepulchre, demand the head.
Affection compels him to place the finishing stroke to his duteous offices.
He takes up the bones half-burnt and not yet quite decomposed, full of ligaments and of marrow unconsumed he quenches them with sea-water, and, col­ lected together, encloses them in a little spot of earth.
Then, that the light breeze may not bear away the ashes uncovered, he presses down the sand with a stone;
and that the sailor may not disturb the grave for fastening the cable, he inscribes the sacred name with a half-burnt stake, HERE MAGNUS LIES.
Fortune, it pleases thee to call this the tomb of Pompey, in which his father-in-law would ra­ ther that he were interred1, than deprived of the earth.
Rash right hand, why dost thou block up the tomb of Magnus, and shut in the wandering ghost ?
Wherever the extremity of the earth hangs steep over the ocean flowing back does he lie.
The Roman name and all its empire is the limit of the tomb of Magnus.
Overwhelm the stone re­ plete with the disgrace of the Gods.
If to Hercules belongs the whole of (Eta*, and the whole mountain ridges of Nysa make room for Bromius, why for Magnus in Egypt is there a single stone?
All the fields of Lagus he might possess, if upon no clod his name was inscribed.
Let us nations still be ignorant, and, Magnus, through respect for thy ashes, let us tread upon no sands of Nile.
But if thou dost deign to grace a stone with name so holy, add thy deeds so mighty, and the most glorious memo­ rials of thy exploits;
add the fierce rebellion of Lepidus 2, and the Alpine wars;
the conquered arms, too, of Serto­ rius3, the Consul recalled;
the triumphs, too, which, still a knight4, he enjoyed;
commerce, too, rendered safe to na­ tions, and the Cilicians, fearful of the sea.
Add barbarism subdued5, and the wandering nations 6, and whatever realms lie beneath the eastern breeze and Boreas.
Say how that after arms he always sought again the toga of the citizen;
.
how that, thrice his chariot speeding on in triumph, he was content to make present to his country of full many a triumph.
What tomb can contain these things ?
Here rises a wretched sepulchre, filled with no titles, with no recital so vast of his annals;
and after being wont to be read above7 the lofty heights of the Gods and the arches built up1 with the spoils of the foe, not far is the name of Pompey from the lowest sand, crouching low on his tomb, which the so­ journer cannot read standing upright, which, unless pointed out, the Roman stranger would be passing by.
Egyptian land, rendered guilty by civil fate, not unde­ servedly indeed was warning given 2 by the lines of the prophetess of Cumæ, that the soldier of Hesperia was not to touch the Pelusian shores of the Nile, and the banks swelling in summer-time.
What, ruthless land, ought I to pray for thee for a crime so great?
May Nile, detained in the region from which he springs, change the course of his streams, and may the barren fields miss the wintry waters a, and mayst thou be entirely lost in the loose sands of the Æthiopians.
We in Roman Temples have received thy Isis", and the half-dog Deities5, and the sistra command­ ing grief1, and Osiris, whom 2 thou by mourning dost attest to have been a man;
thou, Egypt, art keeping our shades" in the dust.
Thou, also, although thou hast now granted Temples to the ruthless tyrant4, hast not yet sought, 0 Rome, the ashes of Pompey;
still lies in exile the ghost of the chieftain.
If former ages dreaded the threats of the conqueror, now, at least, receive the bones of thy Magnus, if, not yet rooted up by the waves, they remain in the hated land.
Who will respect the tomb5 ?
Who will be afraid to disturb a ghost deserving of sacred rites ?
I wish that Rome would enjoin this wickedness on me, and be ready to employ my bosom6;
enough, and 0 too greatly blessed, if me it should befall to transfer to Ausonia the ghost removed, if of a chieftain to violate such a tomb.
Perhaps, when Rome shall be desirous to ask of the Gods of heaven either an end for the barren furrows, or for the fatal south winds', or for heat too great, or for the earth moving the houses, by the counsel and command, Magnus, of the Gods, thou wilt remove to thy City, and the highest Priest2 will carry thy ashes.
Now, who will go to Syene3, scorched by the burning Crab, and Thebes, parched beneath4 the showery Pleiad, a spectator of the Nile?
who, Magnus, will repair to the waters of the deep Red Sea, or the ports of the Arabians, a barterer of the merchandize of the East, whom the venerable stone upon the tomb, and the ashes scattered perchance upon the surface of the sands will not attract, and who will not delight in propitiating thy shade, and in preferring thee to Casian Jove5 ?
In no degree will that grave prove injurious to thy fame.
Buried in a Temple and in gold, shade of higher worth thou wouldst be;
now is Fortune in place of the greatest Divinity, lying buried in this tomb 6.
More august than 7 the altars of the conqueror is the stone beaten against upon the Libyan shore.
Those who have full oft denied their frankincense to the Tarpeian Gods1 would venerate the Deity enclosed beneath the dusky clod.
This in future time will advantage thee, that the lofty mass of thy sepulchre, destined to endure, has not soared aloft with its ponderous marble.
No great length of time will scatter the heap of scanty dust, and the tomb will fall, and the proofs of thy death will perish.
An age more blest will come, in which there will be no credit given to those who point out that stone;
and to the generations of pos­ terity Egypt will be as lying in the tomb of Magnus, as Crete in that 2 of the Thunderer.
The soul of Pompey, leaving the tomb, soars to the abodes of the Blessed, and thence looking down upon the earth inspires the breasts of Brutus and Cato, 1-23.
Cato, with the remnant of Pompey'a forces, repairs to Cor­ cyra, 24-35.
And thence to Crete and Africa, where he meets the fleet of Pompey with Cornelia, 36-50.
She, having beheld the death of her husband and the funeral pile, has been reluctant to leave the shores of Egypt, 51-116.
After which she has touched at Cyprus, whence she has repaired to Africa to join Cato and the eldest son of Pompey, where Sextus informs his brother Cneius of their father's death, 117-145.
Cneius is desirous to proceed to Egypt, but is dissuaded by Cato, 146-166.
Cor­ .
nelia having landed, bums the vestments and arms of Pompey, which she has brought with her, in place of his body, and performs the funereal rites, 167-185.
Cato delivers an oration in praise of Pompey, 186-214.
The soldiers of Cato become dissatisfied, and wish to return home, the chief among the malcontents being Tarchondimotus, the Cilician, whom Cato rebukes;
on which another one replies that they followed Pompey for his own sake, and not for the love of civil war, and that they are now desirous to return home, 215-254.
Cato is indignant, and by his eloquence prevails upon them to stay, 255-293.
The soldiers are trained to arms, and the city of Cyrene is taken, 294-299.
They embark for the kingdom of Juba;
the Syrtes are described, 300-318.
A tern.
pest arises, and the ships are separated, 319-347.
The region of Tritonis is described, in which were formerly the golden orchards of the Hesperides, and the river Lethe, 348-367.
The fleet, having escaped the Syrtes, anchors off the coast of Libya, 368-370.
Cato, impatient of delay, per­ suades his soldiers to disembark and to march over the sandy desert, 371- 410.
A description of Libya, and the evils to be encountered by those who travel there, 411-497.
The soldiers are tormented by thirst, 498-511.
They arrive at the Temple of Jupiter Ammon;
its situation is described, 512-543.
Labienus exhorts them to consult the oracle, 544-563.
Cato dissuades them, saying that it is enough to know that a brave man ought to die with fortitude, 564-586.
They proceed on their march, and arrive at a spring filled with serpents, at which, however, encouraged by Cato, they drink, 587-618.
The Poet enters on an enquiry how Africa came to be thus infested with serpents, and relates the story of Medusa, 619-658.
And how Perseus cut off her head, 659-684.
And then flew in the air over Libya, the blood of the Gorgon falling on which produced the ser­ pents, which are then described, 685-733.
During Cato's march, many of his men are killed by the serpents;
their deaths are described, 734-838.
The complaints of the soldiers, 839-880.
The fortitude of Cato, 881-889.
The Psylli assist them in their distress by sucking the poison out of their wounds, 890-941.
They arrive at Leptis, 942-949.
In the meantime Cæsar, in pursuit of Pompey, sails along the Hellespont and touches at Troy, 950-965.
Which in described, 966-999.
He arrives in Egypt, where a soldier, sent by the king, meets him with the head of Pompey, 1000-1033.
Cæsar, though really overjoyed, sheds tears, and reproaches Pompey's murderers, and then commands them to appease the shade of Pompey, 1034-1108.
BUT not in the Pharian embers lay the shade, nor did a few ashes contain a ghost.
so mighty;
forth from the tomb did he issue, and, leaving the limbs half burnt and the unworthy pile, he reached the concave of the Thunderer1, where the swarthy air2 meets with the starry poles, and where it extends between the earth and the courses of the moon (half-deified shades a inhabit it, whom, guiltless in their lives, an ardent virtue4 has made able to endure the lower tracts of heaven), and he withdrew his spirit to the eternal spheres.
Not thither do those come entombed in gold, or buried amid frankincense..
There, after he had filled himself with genuine, light, and admired5 the wandering planets, and the stars fixed in the skies, he beheld beneath how vast a night our day lies concealed, and he laughed at the mockery of his headless body.
Hence did he hover over the plains of Emathia, and the standards of the blood-stained Cæsar, and the fleets scattered upon the waves;
and, the avenger of crimes, he seated himself in the hallowed bosom of Brutus 1, and im­ planted himself in the breast of the unconquered Cato.
He, while the chances were undecided, and it remained in doubt, which one the civil wars were to make ruler of the world, had hated Magnus too, although he had gone as his follower in arms, hurried on by the auspices of his country and by the guidance of the Senate;
but after the disasters of Thessaly, then with all his heart he was a partisan of Pompey.
His country, wanting a protector, he took into his oun pro­ tection, the trembling limbs of the people he cherished once more, the swords thrown away he placed again in timid hands, and neither desiring rule, nor yet fearing to serve under another he waged the civil war.
Nothing in arms did he do for the sake of self;
after the death of Magnus it was entirely the party of liberty;
and, lest victory should sweep this away scattered along the shores, with the rapid speed of Cæsar, he sought the secret retreats of Corcyra 3, and in a thousand ships 4 carried off with him the fragments of the Emathian downfall.
Who could have supposed that flying troops were speeding on in barks so numerous?
Who, that conquered ships were crowding the seas ?
Then does he repair to Dorian Malea1, and Tænarus open to the shades2, and next Cythera3;
and Crete vanishes, Boreas speeding on the barks;
the waves moderating, he coasts along the Dictæan shores4.
Then,
Phycus, that dared5 to shut its ports against the fleet, and that well deserved ruthless rapine, he burst into and sacked;
and thence, Palinurus, was he borne by the calm breezes along the deep to thy shores a;
(for not only in the Ausonian seas7 dost thou possess memorials;
Libya, also, testifies that her quiet ports were pleasing to the Phrygian pilot;
) when, spreading their sails afar upon the deep, some ships kept their minds in suspense8, whether they were conveying partners in their misfortunes, or whether foes.
The con- queror, so swiftly moving, made everything to be dreaded, and in no ship was he not believed to be.
But these barks were bearing grief and lamentation, and woes to move the tears of even the stem Cato.
For after by entreaties Cornelia had in vain tried to detain the sailors and the flight of her step-son 1 , lest by chance, beaten back from the Pharian shores, the trunk might return to sea, and uhen the flames disclosed the pile with .
funeral rites unworthy of him, she exclaimed:
­ " Have I, then, Fortune, proved unworthy to light the pile for my husband, and, stretched upon his cold limbs, to throw myself upon my spouse?
To burn my hair torn out2?
And to gather up the limbs of Magnus dis­ persed upon the sea?
To pour abundant tears into all his wounds ?
To cover my garments with the bones and the heated embers 3, about to scatter in the Temples of the Gods whatever I might be allowed to take from the ex­ tinguished pyre ?
Without any honor of funereal rites is the pile to burn ;
perhaps an Egyptian hand has performed this office repulsive to his shade 4.
0 well did the ashes of the Crassi lie exposed!
By greater enmity of the Gods has the fire fallen to Pompey's lot.
Shall there always be to me a like fatality in my woes ?
Shall I never be allowed to provide a grave for my husband ?
Shall I never lament over a filled urn ?
What further need, sorrow, hast thou of tombs, or why require any instruments of grief?
Dost thou not, unnatural one, retain Pompey throughout all thy breast?
Does not his image dwell in thy inmost vitals ?
Let one look for the ashes, who is destined long to survive."
Still, however, now does the fire that from afar shines with scanty light 5, as it rises from the Pharian shore, pre- sent to me something, Magnus, of thee.
Now has the flame subsided, and the smoke that bears Pompey away vanishes at the rising of the sun, and, hateful to me, the winds spread the sails.
Not now if any land conquered by Pompey were affording a triumph, would it be more dear to me, nor yet the chariot as it wears away the lofty Capitol;
Magnus as prosperous has vanished from my breast.
Him do I wish for whom the Nile retains, and at remaining on the guilty land I do not complain;
the crime makes wel­ come the sands.
If I am believed at all, I wish not to leave the Pelusian shores."
Do thou, Sextus, try throughout the world the chances of war, and bear thy father's standards;
for Pompey left this charge to you his sons, entrusted to my care:
"'
When the fated hour shall have doomed me to death, take up, 0 my sons, the civil war, and never, while on earth any one of my race shall remain, let opportunity be given to the Cæsars to reign.
Urge on even monarchies, even cities powerful in their own liberty, by the fame of my name.
This party, these arms, to you do I leave.
He will find fleets whichever Pompey1 shall launch upon the waves;
and to no nations shall my heir not cause war;
only do you have feelings unsubdued- and mindful of your father's rights.
Cato alone will it be right to obey, if he shall espouse the cause of liberty.'"
Magnus, I have performed my trust to thee;
thy in­ junctions I have complied with.
Thy stratagem has taken effect2, and, deceived, I have survived, that I might not, breaking my faith, carry away the words entrusted to me.
Now then, husband, through empty Chaos will I follow thee, through Tartarus, if any such there is:
how long respited from death it is uncertain;
upon itself will I first wreak vengeance for my long-enduring life.
It endured, Magnus, beholding thy wounds, not to take refuge in death;
smitten with blows in wailing it shall end, it shall flow forth in tears;
never shall I have to resort to the sword or the halter, or the headlong leap1 through the empty realms of air.
It is disgraceful, after thee not to be able to die of grief alone.
"When thus she had spoken, she covered her head with a mourning veil, and resolved to endure darkness, and lay hid in the recesses of the ship ;
and, strictly embracing cruel grief, she enjoyed her tears, and cherished mourning for her husband.
Not the billows moved her, and the eastern gales howling through the rigging, and the cries that rose in extreme peril;
and conceiving wishes opposed to the anxious sailors, composed for death she lay, and wished success to the storms.
Cyprus with its foaming waves first receives the ship ;
thence, the eastern gales, retaining possession of the deep, but now more moderate, impel them towards the Libyan settlements 2, and the camp of Cato.
Sad, as is his pre­ saging mind amid much fear, Magnus from the shore3 be­ holds the companions of his father, his brother, too ;
head­ long is he then borne through the midst of the waves.
"
Say, brother, where is our father;
does the summit and head of the earth exist, or are we undone ?
Has Magnus home away the destinies of Rome to the shades ?
"Thus he says;
him, on the other hand, his brother ad­ dresses in such words as these.,-- 0 happy thou, whom fate has separated in other regions, and who dost only hear of this wickedness :
brother, I have eyes guilty of looking on my father uhen dying.
Not by the arms of Cæsar did he fall, and so perish by a worthy author of his downfall;
under the impure king who owns the fields of Nile, relying on the Gods of hospitality, and his services so great to his pro­ genitors 4, he fell, the victim of the realm he had presented.
I myself beheld them wounding the breast of our noble sire, and not believing that the Pharian tyrant could pos­ sibly commit so great a crime, I imagined that1 already his father-in-law was standing on the shores of the Nile."
But me neither did the blood nor the wounds of our aged sire so much affect, as the head of the chieftain carried through the city, which we saw borne aloft on a javelin thrust through it;
the report is that this is saved for the eyes of the ruthless conqueror, and that the tyrant wishes to ensure belief in his guilt.
But, whether Pharian dogs and greedy birds have torn the body in pieces, or whether a stealthy fire2 which we saw consumed it, I am ignorant.
Whatever injustice of fate has carried away these limbs, for these crimes do I forgive the Gods of heaven;
as to the portion preserved do I lament.
"When Magnus heard such words as these, he did not pour forth his sorrow in groans and tears ;
and inflamed with righteous affection he thus spoke :
-"
Launch forth, ye sailors, the ships from the dry shore;
with its oars let the fleet cleave onward against the opposing gales;
come on, ye chieftains, with me;
never for civil war was there a reward so great, to inter the unburied ghost, to satiate Magnus with the blood of the effeminate tyrant.
Shall I not sink the Pellfean towers, and the corpse of Alexander, torn from its shrine, in the sluggish Mareotis 3?
Dragged forth from the sepulchres of the pyramids, shall not Amasis and the other kings float for me upon the stream of the Nile ?
For thee unburied, Magnus, let all the sepulchres pay the pe­ nalty ;
I will hurl forth Isis from her tomb, now a Divinity among the nations, and over the ashes of Magnus shall sacred Apis be slain.
Osiris, too 1, clad in linen, I will scatter among the crowd;
and, the Gods placed beneath, I will burn Pompey's head.
This penalty shall the land pay to me;
the fields I will leave deprived of cultivation, and no one shall there be for whom Nile shall increase;
and thou, my sire, shalt possess Egypt alone, the people and the Deities banished.
"He said, and was hurrying the fleet into the ruthless waves.
But Cato restrained the praiseworthy resentment of the youth.
In the meantime, the death of Magnus being heard of, the sky resounded, smitten by lamentations;
there was grief, too, wanting a parallel and known to no age, the people bewailing the death of a great man.
But, still more, when, exhausted by tears, having her dishevelled locks stream­ ing over her features, Cornelia was seen coming forth from the ship, did they again lament with redoubled blows2.
As soon as she reached the shores of a friendly land, she collected the garments and the memorials of the ill-fated Magnus, and the spoils embossed with gold, which he had formerly worn, and the embroidered robes 3, vestments thrice beheld4 by supreme Jove, and she threw them into a funereal fire.
To her thus sorrowing these were the ashes of Magnus.
All feelings of affection followed her example, and throughout all the shore funeral piles arose, giving their fires to the Thessaliam shades 1.
Thus, when the Apulian 2 is preparing to reproduce the grass on the plains eaten bare, and to renew the wintry herbage, does he warm the earth with fires, and together do both Garganus" and the fields of Vultur 4 and the pastures for oxen on warm Ma­ tinus 5 shine.
Still, not more pleasing did all that the common people dared to utter in censure of the Gods of heaven, and in which it rebuked the Deities as to Pompey, reach the ghost of Magnus, than did the words of Cato, few, but coming from a breast replete with truth."
A citizen has perished," he said, "much inferior to our forefathers 6 in knowing moderation in his sway, but still, useful in this age, which has had no respect 7 for justice, powerful, liberty still safe, and the only one who was a pri­ vate man when the people were ready to be his slaves, and the ruler of the Senate, but of that stili reigning.
Nothing in right of war did he demand;
whatever he wished to be granted him he wished it to be possible for it to be refused him.
Wealth unbounded did he possess, but more did he present to the public than what was retained;
the sword he took up, but he knew how to lay it down.
Arms he pre­ ferred to civil life 1;
but, amid arms, he loved peace."
Authority assumed pleased the chieftain;
laid down, it pleased him.
Chaste was his household, and void of luxury, and never corrupted by the good fortune of its lord.
A name illustrious and revered by nations, and one that has advantaged our City much.
Long since, on Sulla and Marius being received2 into the City, real confidence in liberty disappeared;
now, Pompey taken away from the State, even a feigned one perishes.
No longer now will there be shame at holding kingly sway;
neither the colour of authority, nor yet any front of the Senate, will there be.
O happy man, whom, when conquered, his last day came to meet, and to whom the Pharian villany presented a sword deserving to be sought!
Perhaps under the sway of his father-in-law he might have been able to live.
To know how to die is the first blessing to man, but the next, to be compelled.
To me, too, if by the Fates we fall into the power of another, Fortune, grant Juba to be such;
I do not be,,, not to be reserved for an enemy, so long as 3 he reserves me, my head cut off.
"By these words more honor in his death accrued to the noble shade, than if the Roman Rostra had resounded with praises of the chieftain.
In the meantime, the discord of the people in the camp creates murmurs, and after the death of Magnus they are weary of the war, when Tarchondimotus4 raises the standard for leaving Cato.
Following him to the edge of the shore, as he flies with his fleet hurrying off, Cato censures him in such words:
" 0 Cilician, never reduced to peace, dost thou again go to thy rapine on the main ?
Fortune has removed Magnus;
now as a pirate thou art returning to the seas."
Then he gazes upon all the men in groups and in commo­ tion;
one of whom, disclosing his mind as to the flight, in such words addresses the chief:
­ " Cato, grant us pardon, it was the love of Pompey, not of civil war, that moved us to arms, and through affection did we espouse a faction.
He lies prostrate, whom the earth preferred to peace, and fallen is our cause;
allow us to re­ visit our country's household Gods, and our deserted homes and dear children.
For what end of the contest will there be, if neither Pharsalia nor Pompey shall be so ?
The mo­ ments of our lives have been wasted;
let death come upon us in our retreat;
let our old age look forward to the flames its due.
Civil warfare can hardly afford sepulchres to chief­ tains.
No barbarian sway awaits the conquered ;
no cruel Fortune threatens me with an Armenian or a Scythian yoke;
I come beneath the rule of a citizen who wears the toga.
"Whoever, while Magnus was living, was the second, the same to me shall be the first;
the highest honor shall be paid to the hallowed shade;
the ruler whom disaster forces me to have, I will have;
general, Magnus, none.
Thee alone having followed to the war, next after thee will I follow des­ tiny 1, for it is neither right nor lawful for me to hope for success.
All things are embraced by the fortune of Cæsar;
victory has destroyed the Emathian sword.
All confiding is closed against us in our wretchedness, and in the whole earth there is one alone, who is willing and is able to give safety to the conquered.
Pompey slain, civil war is a crime, who living it was fidelity.
If, Cato, thou wilt always obey the public laws, if always thy country, let us follow the standards which Cæsar, the Roman Consul, raises.
"Thus having said, he leaped on board ship, the cheers of the youths accompanying him.
There was an end of the state of Rome, and in want of servitude all the multitude thronged upon the shore.
These words burst forth from the hallowed breast of their leader:
— "
Did you then, youths, wage the war with like hopes 1, were you too for tyrants, and were you a Pompeian, not a Roman, army ?
Because for no one's sway you toil, because for yourselves, not for your leaders, you live and die, because for no one you win the world, because now it is safe for you to con­ quer, do you fly from war, and do you seek a yoke, your necks yet free, and know you not how to endure to be with­ out a king ?"
Now is the cause of danger worthy of men.
Pompey might have made bad use of your blood;
now to your country do your refuse your throats and swords, when liberty is nigh?
Of three lords Fortune has now left but one2.
Be ashamed of yourselves;
more has the court of the Nile conferred upon the laws, the bows, too, of the Parthian soldiers.
Away, 0 degenerate men, despise the gift and the arms of Ptolemy 3.
Who could suppose that your hands were guilty of any slaughter ?
He will believe that you readily turned your backs, he will believe that you were the first to fly from Emathian Philippi 4."
Go in security;
in Cæsar's judgment you have deserved life, subdued by no arms, in no siege.
0 base slaves, after the death of your first master you descend to his heir.
Why do you not choose to merit more than life and pardon?
Let the unhappy wife of Magnus, and the offspring of Metellus 5 be hurried off upon the waves;
carry off the Pompeys, surpass the gift of Ptolemy.
My own head as well, whoever shall present to the hated tyrant, will give it for no small reward.
This force will know that at the price of ray life it has well followed my standards.
Come on, then, and in one vast slaughter earn your deserts;
cowardly treason only is flight.
"He thus said, and all the ships did he recall from the midst of the sea, no otherwise than as when the swarms together leave the teeming wax, and, forgetful of the combs, mingle not -their wings 1 in clusters, but each one takes flight for itself, nor now slothfully tastes the bitter thyme;
the sound of the Phrygian brass 2 censures them;
astounded, they cease their flight, and seek again the pursuits of their flower-gathering labours, and their fondness for the scat­ tered honey;
freed from care, glad is the shepherd on the grass of Hybla 3, that he has preserved the wealth of his cottage:
thus by the words of Cato was patience recom­ mended to the men in a righteous warfare.
And now by the movements of war, and by a continuance of labours he determines to exercise their minds, not taught to endure repose.
First, the soldiers are wearied on the sands of the sea-shore;
at the walls and fortifications4 of Cyrene5 is their next labour;
excluded, by no wrath does he avenge himself;
and the sole vengeance of Cato upon the conquered is the having conquered them.
Thence does it please him to repair to the realms of Juba 1, adjoining to the Moors;
but nature forbids a passage by the Syrtes 2 lying between;
a dauntless valour trusts that these even will give way to it.
Either nature, when she gave its first figure to the world, left the Syrtes in a doubtful position between sea and land (for neither did the land subside entirely in order that it might receive the waters of the deep, nor did it protect itself from the sea;
but a tract lay impassable, by reason of the ambiguous nature of the place;
the seas are broken by shoals, and the land is torn away by the deep, and the waves intervening, resound behind many a shallow.
Thus did nature heedlessly forsake it, and she wrought for no use this portion of herself);
or else the Syrtis once was more full of the deep ocean, and was entirely deluged with waters;
but the scorching sun 3, feeding his light with the.
sea, drew up the adjacent waters of the.
burnt-up zone;
and now, the sea still contends with Phœbus as he dries it up.
At a future day, when destroying time shall have enough applied the rays, the Syrtis will be dry land;
for now shallow water floats above, and the waves are failing, destined far and wide to come to an end.
When first all the force of the fleet impelled the sea' urged by its oars, the south wind, black with showers, roared, raging throughout his realms 4;
with a whirlwind he defends the deep invaded by the fleets, and far from the Syrtes he drives the billows, and dashes the sea upon the extending shores.
Then, the sails of some which he finds extended on.
the upright masts, he tears away from the mariners;
and the ropes having vainly attempted to deny the canvas to the southern gales, they surpass the length of the ship, and beyond the prow swells the bellying sail.
If any one with foresight has fastened beneath all the cloth to the topmost yard, he, too, with bared rigging is driven out of his course.
Better was the lot of the fleet which happened upon deep waves, and was tossed by a steady sea.
Whatever ships lightened by their masts cut down avoided the raging blast, the tide at liberty bore these on, rolling them in a contrary direction to the winds, and victorious drove them against the struggling south wind.
Some barks do the shallows forsake, and the earth broken in upon by the deep strikes them;
and exposed to a doubtful fate, one part of the ship rests on land, the other part is poised in the waves.
Then still more is the sea dashed upon the quicksands, and the earth rages rising to meet it in its path;
although repelled by the south wind, still full oft the wave masters not the hills of sand.
There stands aloft upon the surface of the main afar from all the fields, untouched by the water, a heap of now dry sand;
the wretched sailors stand confounded, and the ship run on land they behold no shore.
Thus does the sea intercept a part;
a greater portion of the ships obey the rudder and the helm;
safe in flight, and having obtained pilots well acquainted with the spot, un­ hurt it arrives at the stagnant swamps of Triton 1.
This, as the report is, the God loves, whom throughout all the shore the ocean hears, as he raises his murmurs on his windy shell2;
this does Pallas 3 love as well, who, springing from her father's head touched Libya first of all lands (for nearest is it to heaven, as the heat itself proves 1), and be­ held her features2 in the quiet water of the pool, and on the margin set her feet, and named herself Tritonis from the beloved waves.
Near to which does Lethon 3, silent river, flow along;
bringing obliviousness, as is the report, from the streams of hell;
and, once the care of the sleepless dragon, the poor garden of the Hesperides 4, spoiled of its boughs.
Spiteful the man, who robs old times of their credit, and who sum­ mons poets to the truth.
There was a golden wood, and branches weighed down with riches and with yellow fruit;
a virgin troop 5, too, were the guardians of the shining grove, and a serpent with its eyes never condemned to sleep, entwining around the boughs bending with shining metal.
Alcides took away the prize from the trees ;
and, allowing the branches to be valueless without their load, brought back the shining apples to the tyrant of Argos 1.
Pushing off from these spots 2, therefore, and driven away from the Syrtes, the fleet did not proceed beyond the waves of the Garamantes but under the command of Pompey remained on the coasts of more wealthy Libya.
But the valour of Cato, impatient at delaying, ventured to lead his band among unknown nations, and to skirt the Syrtes by land, trusting in his arms.
This did the same wintry season prompt, which had shut up the deep;
and showers were objects of their hopes, as they feared the excessive heats;
that the year would temper their march, severe with neither the sun's heat nor with extreme cold, on the one hand with the clime of Libya, on the other with the winter season.
And, about to enter upon the barren sands, be thus spoke :
­ " 0 ye, to whom, following my camp, one safety alone has proved pleasing, to die with necks unenslaved, make up your minds to the great work of constancy and labours extreme.
We are going unto sterile plains and scorched regions of the world, where are excessive heat of the sun and scanty water in the springs, and the parched fields are hor­ rid with deadly serpents, a toilsome march.
For the sake of the laws and for the love of their falling country, through the midst of Libya let them come, and let them attempt these places so remote, if any have centered their wishes in no escape, if to any to march onward is enough.
Nor in­ deed is it my intention to deceive any one, and by conceal­ ing my fears to draw on the multitude."
Let those be my companions, whom the dangers them­ selves would lead, who, myself the witness, would deem it glorious and befitting a Roman to endure even the most shocking fate.
But the soldier who wants a surety for his safety, and is influenced by the sweetness of life, let him go to a tyrant by an easier way.
So long as I am the first to set foot upon the sands;
and the first to imprint my steps in the dust, upon me let the heat of the sky strike 1, me let the serpent, filled with venom, meet;
and try before­ hand your perils in my fate;
whoever shall behold me drinking, let him thirst;
or whoever shall see me seeking the shade of the groves, let him swelter with heat, or on horse­ back going before troops of foot, let him flag;
if in fact it shall by any difference be known whether as.
general or as soldier I am marching.
Serpents, thirst, heat, sand, are sweet to valour;
in adversity patience delights.
More, pleasing is that which is honorable, as often as it costs itself a heavy price.
Libya alone can present a multitude of woes that it would beseem men to fly from.
"Thus did he with valour and with the love of diffi­ culties inflame their wavering minds, and commence upon a path not to be retraced with its desert track;
and, destined in a little tomb to enclose a hallowed name, Libya secured the death of Cato, free from care.
Libya is the third part of the earth, if you are ready to trust report in everything;
but if you trace the winds and climate, it will be a portion of Europe.
For, not more dis­ tant are the shores of Nile, than is the Scythian Tanais from the nearest Gades, in which quarter Europe separates from Libya, and by their retreat the shores make room for the ocean:
but a larger portion of the world composes Asia singly2.
For whereas 3, these in common send forth Zephyrus, the other touching upon the left-hand side of Boreas, and the right-hand side of the South, slopes away to the East, alone possessing Eurus.
That which is the fertile part of the Libyan land lies to the Westward ;
but even this is not relaxed with any springs;
with few Northern breezes does it receive the Arctoan showers, and refresh its fields with our serene weather.
It is corrupted by no riches1;
neither for copper nor for gold is it melted, with no faultiness of the soil, it is pure, and is mould throughout.
The Maurusian wood 2 is the only wealth of the race, the use of which it knows not, but it lives content with the foliage of the cedar, and its shade.
To unknown groves have our axes come, and in the ex­ tremities of-the earth have we sought our banquets and our tables 3.
But whatever region skirts around the shift­ ing Syrtis, extended beneath heat too intense, adjacent to a parching sky, it scorches the corn and chokes up the grape 4 with dust, and, crumbling, is held by no root.
A temperature suited to life is wanting, and under no care of Jove 5 is that land;
nature lying slothful, the region is torpid, and with its unmoved sands is not sensible of the changing year.
Still, this soil so dull puts forth a few herbs, which the Nasamonian 6, a hardy race, collects, who, bare of all comforts, possesses the country adjacent to the sea;
and whom the barbarian Syrtis feeds 7 with the losses of the world.
For the wrecker hovers over the sands of the shore, and, no keel touching at his harbours, he knows of wealth.
Thus in shipwrecks do the Nasamonians have traffic, with the whole world.
This way does resolute valour bid Cato march.
There is the youthful band regardless of the winds, and, dreading no storms by land, suffers the terrors of the deep 1.
For upon the dry shore does the Syrtis with greater violence receive the south winds than on the sea, and more injurious is it to the land.
With no mountains opposing does Libya break itsforce, and scatter it repelled by rocks, and change it from a hurri­ cane into serene air;
nor does it rush into woods, and weary itself with hurling down aged oaks ;
all the land lies open, and in its passage it works out the rage of Æolus, free from all rein ;
and the sand whirled aloft, sweeping along it drives in wreaths a cloud teeming with no rain.
The greater por­ tion of the land is raised on high, and, in a whirlwind2 never dissolved, hangs aloft.
The poor Nasamonian sees his possessions 3 floating in the wind, and his home rent asunder;
and, the Garamantian laid bare, the cottages, torn away, fly from the roofs.
Not higher does fire bear aloft what it consumes;
and as far as it is possible for smoke to arise and to obscure the day, so high does the sand pos­ sess the air.
Then, too, more violently than usual does it attack the Roman troops, and not a soldier is able to keep his footing, infirm of hold, even the sands being borne away on which he treads.
It would shake the earth, and would move the region away from the spot, if Libya, of solid texture and of hard substance, all covered with crags, were to enclose the southern blasts in its caverns eaten away;
but because it is easily moved with its shifting sands, by never struggling it remains firm, and the lower part of the land stands fast, because the upper gives way.
With its violent impulse the blast hurls away helmets and shields and the javelins of the men, and, without ceas­ ing, bears them through the void realms of the wide hea­ vens.
Perhaps on some foreign and far remote land that is a prodigy;
and nations are alarmed at weapons falling from the skies, and, torn away from the arms of men, they think them sent down1 by the Gods of heaven.
Thus undoubt­ edly did those fall for sacrificing Numa, which the chosen youths 2 wore on their Patrician necks;
the South wind or Boreas had spoiled nations bearing our ancilia 3.
Notus thus attacking the region, the Roman troops lay down, and, dreading to be borne away, girded fast their clothes, and thrust their hands into the earth ;
nor by their weight alone did they lie, but by their efforts to hold fast, hardly thus unmoved by the southern blasts;
which rolled upon them vast heaps of sand, and covered the men with earth.
Hardly is the soldier able to raise his limbs, sticking fast in a large pile of dust.
Some even standing the vast mass of drifted sand overpowers;
and, unable to move, they are held fast in the rising ground.
Stones does it bear afar, torn away from the walls shaken down, and scatter them at a distance, with a wondrous kind of disaster;
they who beheld no houses, behold the ruins.
And now all the path lies hid;
nor is there now any difference in the sky and earth, except the lights of heaven, as though in the midst of the sea.
By the Constellations they know the way, nor does the horizon, the limit of the Libyan region, show the well-known Constellations, and it conceals many of them by the margin of the earth downward sloping.
And when the heat released the air which the wind had borne to and fro, and the day was inflamed, their limbs flowed with perspiration, their mouths were parched with thirst.
A little water was beheld afar in a scanty streamlet;
which a soldier, with difficulty scooping it up from the dust, poured forth into the wide concavity of a helmet and offered to the general.
The jaws of all were clogged with dust;
and, receiving the tiny draught of water, the general himself was an object of envy.
“What," said he, “degenerate soldier, didst thou suppose that I alone in this multitude was devoid of manliness?
Did I seem so very tender and unequal to the morning's heat ?
How much more worthy of this punishment art thou, to be drinking while the people thirsts !"
Thus, aroused with anger, he dashed down the helmet, and the water sufficed for allThey had now come to the Temple, the only one which among the Libyan nations the uncivilized Garamantes pos­ sess.
There stands Jupiter, the foreteller of destiny, as they relate;
but not either brandishing the lightnings or like to ours, but Ammon with crooked horns 2.
Not there have Libyan nations erected costly Temples, nor do shrines glitter with eastern gems.
Although among the tribes of the Æthiopians 1 and the rich nations of the Arabians and the Indians, Jupiter Ammon is the only God, still he is a poor God, possessing sanctuaries polluted in no age with wealth, and a Divinity of primitive habits, he protects the Temple from Roman gold.
That there are Deities in the spot a wood attests, the only one verdant2 throughout all Libya.
For whatever country with its parching sand separates burning Berenice from hot Leptis, is destitute of shrubs;
Ammon alone produces a grove.
A fountain on the spot is the cause of the woods, which knits together the crumbling particles of earth, and unites the sand subdued by its waters.
Here, as well, nothing resists Phcebus, when in the highest zenith the day stands poised;
hardly does the tree over­ shadow its trunk, so small a shadow is thrown down perpendicularly by the rays.
It has been ascertained that this is the spot where the circle3 of the elevated solstice cuts through the mid sphere of the Constellations.
Not ob­ liquely do they proceed, nor does the Scorpion go more vertically than the Bull, nor does the Ram give his hours 4 to the Balance, nor does Astræa bid the lagging Fishes to go down.
Chiron is equally 5 matched with the Twins, and just as the burning Carcinus is the watery Ægoceros 6, nor is the Lion raised higher than the Urn.
But whatever race thou art, cut off by the Libyan fires, for thee the shadows fall to the south, which with us go towards the north;
and the Cynosure, slowly moving, sets 1 ;
thou dost think that its dry Wain is immersed in the deep, and dost deem no star in the loftiest heights of the northern sky exempt from the sea.
Afar is either pole, and the course of the Constellations hurries on all of them in the intermediate heavens.
Before the doors stood the nations whom the East had sent, and by the warning of homed Jupiter they sought the approaching destinies;
but for the Latian chieftain they gave way ;
and his attendants entreated Cato that he would enquire of the Deity famed throughout the Libyan world, and form a judgment as to the report of such lengthened ages.
Labienus Was3 the principal adviser to enquire into events by the voice of the Gods.
“Chance," said he, “and the fortune of the way has pre­ sented the lips of a Deity so great and the counsel of a God;
a guide so mighty amid the Syrtes we may employ, and learn the destined events of the warfare.
For to whom could I suppose that the Gods of heaven would rather reveal and disclose their secrets than the truth to the hallowed Cato ?
Assuredly thy life has ever been regulated according to the laws of heaven, and thou art a follower of the God.
Lo!
the opportunity is granted thee of communing with Jove ;
make enquiry into the fates of wicked Cæsar, and search into the future manners of thy country;
whether it will be possible for nations to enjoy their own rights and those of the laws, or whether civil war is hopeless.
Fill thy heart with the sacred words;
ever a lover of strict virtue, seek what is virtue, and request an example of right.
"He, filled with the God, whom in his silent mind he bore, poured forth from his breast words worthy of the shrines :
­ "
What, Labienus, dost thou request to be asked ?
Whe- ther, a free man, I would rather die in arms than behold a tyranny?
Whether life is nothing at all, even though it be a long one ?
Whether age makes any difference ?
Whether any violence can injure the good man ?
Whether Fortune wastes her threats on virtue being opposed to her?
And whether it is enough to wish for what is to be commended, and whether rectitude is never crowned by a successful result ?
“These things we know, and Ammon will not engraft them more deeply.
We all of us depend upon the Gods of heaven, and, his Temple silent, nothing do we effect but by the will of the God.
Nor does the Divinity stand in need of any voice;
and, once for all, our author has told us at our birth1 whatever we may be allowed to know:
nor has he chosen barren sands that he may prophesy to a few, and in this dust concealed the truth.
The abode of God, too, is, wherever is earth, and sea, and air, and sky, and virtue.
Why further do we seek the Gods of heaven?
Whatever thou dost behold and whatever thou dost touch, that is Jupiter.
Let the apprehensive need di­ viners, and those that are ever doubtful on future events;
it is not oracles, but a certain death that makes me certain.
Both the coward and the brave must fall;
this is enough for Jove to have pronounced.
"Thus does he speak;
and, the credit of the Temple pre­ served, he departs from the altars, leaving Ammon untried by the people.
He himself, in his hand wielding a javelin, on foot, goes before, the faces of the panting soldiers.
He shows them how to endure labours, he does not command;
and, with face uplifted2 on no necks is he borne, or sitting in a chariot.
Most sparing is he himself of sleep, the last drinker of the water.
When, at last, a spring discovered, the youthful band longing for the stream endeavour to drink, he stands until the camp follower 3 has drunk.
If by real merits great fame is acquired, and if, success dis­ regarded, unadorned virtue is looked at, whatever in any one of our forefathers we praise was merely Fortune.
Who by prosperous warfare, who by the blood of nations, has deserved a name so great ?
This triumph I would rather conduct through the Syrtes and the extremities of Libya than thrice with the chariot of Pompey ascend the Capitol, than break the neck of Jugurtha1.
Behold a true parent of his country, most worthy, Rome, of thy altars;
by whom it will never shame thee to swear;
and whom, if ever thou shalt stand with neck released, then at last thou art des­ tined to make a God.
Now was the heat more intense, and a region, beyond which none2 in the southern climes have the Gods created, was traversed, and the water was more scarce.
There was found in the middle of the sands a single spring abounding in water, but which a multitude of serpents possessed, the spot hardly containing them.
Parched asps 3 were standing at the brink, in the midst of the waves the Dipsas 4 thirsted.
The chieftain, when he saw them likely to perish, the spring left behind, addressed them:
“ Alarmed with the false show of death, fear not, soldiers, in safety to quaff the stream.
Noxious is the poison of serpents when mixed with the blood;
they have venom in their sting, and they threaten destruction with their teeth;
the draughts are devoid of deadliness.
"He spoke, and quaffed the supposed poison;
and through­ out the whole sands of Libya that was the only stream of which ho was the first to demand the water for himself.
Why the Libyan climate, fruitful in deadliness, should abound in plagues so great, or what nature has secretly mixed in the noxious soil, our care and labour are not able to ascertain;
except that a story, spread throughout all the world, has deceived ages, in place of the real cause.
In the extreme parts of Libya, where the glowing earth re­ ceives the ocean warmed by the setting sun, far and wide lay parched the fields of Medusa, the daughter of Phoreys 1;
not overshadowed by the foliage of the groves, not softened by ridges, but rugged with rocks 2 looked upon by the COWl­ tenance of its mistress.
In this body first did noxious nature produce deadly plagues;
from those jaws snakes poured forth whizzing hisses with vibrating tongues, which, after the manner of a woman's hair flowing along the back, flapped about the very neck of the delighted Medusa.
Upon her forehead turned towards you erect did serpents rise, and viper's venom flowed from her combed locks.
This alone does unhappy Medusa possess, which with im­ punity3 it is permitted all to look upon;
for who has dreaded the mouth and the head of the monster ?
Whom, that with glance direct4 has seen her, has Medusa suffered to die?
She arrested doubting destiny, and prevented fear;
the life retained, the limbs died, and spirits not sent forth grew rigid beneath the bones.
The locks of the Eumenides pro­ duced madness alone;
Cerberus moderated his hissing at the song of Orpheus;
the son of Amphitryon1 beheld the Hydra when he had conquered it.
This monster did Phor­ eus dread, her father, and the second Deity in the waves, her mother Ceto, also, and her Gorgon sisters themselves.
This was able to threaten to the heavens and to the sea an unwonted numbness, and from the universe to withdraw the world.
From the skies the birds fell with sudden weight;
in rocks wild beasts stood fast;
whole nations of Æthio­ pians, inhabiting the vicinity, grew hard in marble.
No animal was there that could brook the sight;
and the ser­ pents themselves, streaming in a backward direction, shunned her countenance.
She turned Atlas the Titan into rock, as he stood beneath the Hesperian pillars ;
and, formerly, the heavens dreading the Giants standing on Phlegræan serpents a for feet, the Gorgon raised moun­ tains aloft, and in the midst of the breast of Pallas ended the mighty warfare of the Gods.
Hither, after the Par­ rhasian wings4 of the Arcadian inventor of the lyre and of the oily palaestra 5 had carried Perseus born of the womb of Danaë 6 and the enriched shower, and the winged steed, that suddenly sprung up, had borne aloft the Cyllenian falchion 1, the falchion reddened already by the slaughter of another monster (the watcher of the heifer beloved by Jove, by it destroyed), unwedded Pallas gave aid to her swift brother2, having stipulated for3 the head of the monster;
and she bade Perseus turn towards the rising of Phœbus on the margin of the Libyan land, cleaving the realms of Gorgon in his flight with averted face;
she gave him, too, a shield for his left hand, shining with yellow gold, in which she bade4 him look at the stone-transforming Me­ dusa, whom sleep, destined to bring on eternal slumber in death, did not entirely overpower.
A great part of her locks are awake, and the snakes, ex­ tending along the hair, protect her head;
on the midst of her features some lie, and upon the lid of her eyes.
Pallas herself guides him palpitating, and in his shaking right hand directs the Cyllenian falchion of the averted Perseus, cutting asunder the broad extremities of the ser­ pent-bearing neck.
What a countenance had the Gorgon, the head cut off by the wound of the hooked sword!
With how much poison I could conceive her mouth breathing forth!
What death, too, her eyes shooting forth!
Not even Pallas was able to look upon her;
and they would have congealed the features of the averted Perseus, if TritQnia had not spread her dense hair, and covered her face with the serpents.
Thus, the Gorgon spoiled, the winged hero flew towards heaven.
He, indeed, was shortening his path, and by a nearer course was cleaving the air;
if he should cut through the midst of the cities of Europe,'Pallas enjoined him not to hurt the fruitful lands, and to spare the nations.
For who, an object so great flying aloft, would not look up at the sky ?
Towards the west he, winged, turns, and over Libya he goes, which, sowed by no agriculture, is exposed to the stars and to Phœbus;
the course of the sun oppresses it and parches up the soil;
nor in any part of the earth does a shadow fall from a loftier height upon the heavens, and impede the course of the moon, if at any time forgetful of her oblique route she runs straight onward through the signs of the Zodiac, and escapes not the shade by swerving to the north or to the south.
Still, that sterile land, and the fields prolific in nothing good, conceive the venom from the gore of the bleeding Medusa, and dreadful moisture from the fell blood, which the heat promotes and anneals in the loose sand.
Here, the gore which first from the sand lifted a head raised the drowsy asp with puffed-out neck 1.
More thick did the blood and the drops of the clogged venom fall on this;
in no serpent is it more dense.
Itself wanting heat, it passes not to a cold clime of its own will, and near the Nile it inhabits the sands.
But what shame shall we have in.
profit ?
Thence are brought hither the deadly plagues of Libya, and the asp we have made an object of traffic 2.
But the huge Hæmorrhois 3 unfolds its scaly wreaths, that will not allow their blood to remain in the wretched sufferers;
the Chersydros, too, is produced to haunt the plains of the doubtful Syrtis, and the Chelydri, trailing along with smoking track 1;
the Cenchris, also2, ever to move in a straight path;
this is painted with more marks on its speckled belly than the Theban Ophites 3, tinted with little spots.
The Ammodytes 4, of the same colour with the parched sands, and not to be distinguished therefrom, and the Cerastæ, moving with twisting back-bone5;
the Scytale, too, alone, even now, the hoar-frost lying scattered on the ground, about to cast its slough;
and the scorching Dipsas;
the dangerous Amphisbæna6, also, that moves on at both of its heads;
the water-serpent, also, the tainter of the water;
and the swift Jaculi, and the Pareas 7, content with its tail to cleave its track;
the greedy Prester 8, too, distending its foaming jaws;
and the deadly Seps 9, dis­ solving the body together with the bones.
The Basilisk 10, too, sending forth hisses that terrify all the plagues, hurtful before its venom, removes from itself far and wide all the race, and rules upon the deserted sands.
You also, the Dragons1, shining with golden brightness, who crawl in all other lands as innoxious Di­ vinities, scorching Africa renders deadly.
With wings you move the air on high, and, following whole herds, you burst asunder vast bulls, embracing them with your folds.
Nor is the elephant safe through his size;
everything you devote to death, and no need have you of venom for a deadly fate.
Amid these pests, Cato, with his hardy soldiers, moved on upon his scorching march, seeing the sad fates of so many of his men and extraordinary deaths through a little wound.
A Dipsas trodden on, turning back its head, bit Aulus, a young standard-bearer of Etrurian blood.
Hardly was there pain or any feeling of the sting, and his face itself was free from the anguish of death, nor did the wound threaten anything.
Behold!
the venom creeps silently on, and a devouring flame consumes his marrow, and burns his entrails with the heating poison.
The virus sucks up the moisture flowing around the vitals, and begins to scorch the tongue with the dried palate;
no perspiration is there to run down his wearied limbs, and the fountain of tears flies from his eyes.
Not the ensign of the state2, not the orders of the sorrowing Cato, restrained the parched man from daring to hurl down the standard, and, infuriate, seek­ ing over all the fields the water which the venom, thirsting in his heart, demanded.
He, sent even to Tanais and Rhone and Padus, would be parched, and even if drinking of Nile as it wanders through the fields.
Libya promoted his death 3, and the Dipsas has a fame unequal to its deadliness, when aided by the scorch­ ing regions.
Deep down he seeks for rain in the glowing sands;
now to the Syrtes he returns, and takes sea-water in his mouth;
and the moisture of the deep is grateful, but suffices not for him.
Nor is he sensible of the nature of the death and -the fatality of the venom, but lie thinks that it is thirst alone, and brooks to open the swelling veins, and to fill his mouth with blood.
Instantly does Cato order the standard to be taken up;
to no one is it allowed to learn that thirst can have this effect.
But a more sad death than that was before their eyes;
and upon the thigh of the wretched Sabellius there stood a little Seps, which, hanging with its barbed tooth, he both tore off with his hand, and pinned with his javelin to the sand;
a little serpent only, but than which not one is so sure a source of a bloody death.
For the skin nearest the wound, torn off, disappears, and discloses the pallid bones.
And now with open surface, without a body left, the wound is bare;
the limbs swim in corrupt matter;
the calves fall off;
without any covering are the hams;
of the thighs, too, every muscle is dissolved, and the groin distils black matter.
The membrane that binds the stomach snaps asunder, and the bowels flow away;
nor does just so much of the entire body as may be expected flow upon the earth, but the raging venom melts the limbs;
soon does the poison convert all the ligaments of the nerves, and the textures of the sides, and the hollow breast, and what is concealed in the vital lungs, everything that composes man, into a dimi­ nutive corrupt mass.
By a foul death does nature lie ex­ posed ;
the shoulders and strong arms melt;
the neck and head flow away.
Not more quickly does the snow fall away, dissolved by the warm south wind, nor is wax influenced by the sun.
Trifling things I mention, how that the body flowed away scorched up by corruption;
this flame can do as well.
But what pile has ever dissolved the bones?
These, too, disappear, and, following the crumbling marrow, suffer no vestiges of their rapid destruction to remain.
Among the Cinyphian plagues1 thine is the palm in destroying;
all take away the life, thou alone the carcase.
Behold!
a form occurs quite different from this wasting death.
A scorching Prester stung Nasidius, a cultivator of the Marsian fields.
A fiery redness lighted up his face, and, his shape destroyed, a swelling, confounding all fea­ titres, now larger than the whole body, stretched out his skin;
and, exceeding the human growth, the corrupt matter puffed up throughout all the limbs;
the poison prevailing far and wide, he himself lay concealed, completely hidden within his swollen body:
nor did the coat of mail withhold the increase of the distended body.
Not thus does the foaming mass of water boil over on the cauldron being heated, nor do the sails under the effects of Corus swell out into a bellying form so vast.
Now he wielded not his limbs a deformed bloated mass, and a trunk in a confused heap.
Not daring to commit it to the tomb, they fled from the increasing carcase, untouched, and destined to afford a feast to the beaks of the birds and to the wild beasts, not with impunity, the swelling not even ceasing after death.
But sights more monstrous do the Libyan pests provide.
A fierce Hæmorrhois thrust its fangs into Tullus, a noble youth, and an admirer of Cato.
And just as the pressure1 of the Corycian saffron2 is wont to discharge itself from all the statues of the Theatre, in such manner do all the members at the same moment send forth a red virus instead of blood.
His tears are blood;
whatever outlets the moisture finds, from them the gore distils in streams ;
his mouth is running over, the distended nostrils too;
his sweat is red;
all his members flow from the gorged veins;
his whole body is as though one wound.
But thy heart, wretched Levus, has the gore, congealed by the serpent of the Nile, benumbed;
and, attesting the sting by no pain, in sudden darkness thou dost receive thy death, and in sleep descend to the Stygian shades.
Not with a fate so swift1 do the slips of the yew, which, resembling the shoots of the Sabine tree, when ripe, the death-gathering Sabræans cut from the deadly trunk, corrupt the draughts.
Behold!
afar, around the trunk of a barren oak a fierce serpent (Africa calls it the Jaculus) wreathes itself, and then darts forth;
and through the head and pierced temples of Paulus it takes its flight;
nothing does venom there effect, death seizes him through the wound.
It was then understood how slowly fly the stones which the sling hurls, how slug­ gishly whizzes the air of the Scythian arrow.
What avails a Basilisk being pierced by the spear of the wretched Murrus ?
Swift flies the poison along the weapon, and fastens upon the hand;
which, instantly, with sword unsheathed, he smites, and at the same moment severs it entirely from the arm;
and, looking upon the dreadful warning of a death his own, he stands in safety, his hand perishing.
And who could suppose that the Scorpion has the power to cause a rapid death ?
He, threatening with knotted tail2, and furious with stroke direct, heaven being the witness, bore off the honors of Orion's death 3.
Who, Solpuga4, would be afraid to tread upon thy abodes ?
And yet to thee do the Stygian sisters give power over5 their threads.
Thus does neither bright day nor dark night bring rest;
it is matter for suspicion for them in their wretchedness upon what ground they are lying.
For neither do leaves, heaped up, form their beds, nor are their couches made larger with reeds ;
but, exposing their bodies to death, they roll upon the ground, and by the warm vapour attract the pests, chilled by the rigor of the night;
and among their limbs they warm the jaws for a time innocuous from the poison having grown torpid.
Nor, the heavens their guide, do they know what is the length of their wanderings, or what the limit.
Full oft complaining, they cry aloud:
" Restore, ye Gods, to us dis­ tressed, the warfare from which we have fled;
restore us Thessaly.
Why do we suffer a coward's death, a band sworn to the sword?
The Dipsas fights for Cæsar, and the Cerastes wages the civil war.
It would please me to go where the torrid zone is red, and the sky scorched by the steeds of the sun;
it would delight me to ascribe to causes of climate that I perish, and to die by reason of the temperature.
Not at all, Africa, of thee, nor, nature, of thee do I complain ;
thou hadst devoted to the serpents a region bearing monsters so numerous, and removed from nations;
and, a soil unable to produce corn, cultivators being denied, thou hast condemned, and hast willed that men should be afar from their venom.
To the regions of the serpents have we come;
demand retribution, thou, whoever thou art, of the Gods above, who, vexed at our trespass, bounding the region by the burning districts on the one side, by the dubious Syrtes on the other, hast placed de­ struction in the middle space.
Through the secret spots of thy retreat does the warfare proceed;
and, with thee sharing the knowledge of the secrets of the earth, the soldier repairs to the confines of the world."
Perhaps greater misfortunes remain for us, having made the entrance.
The fires meet in the hissing waves1, and the fabric of the sky is convulsed.
But, in that direction 2, there lies no land further than lie the sad realms of Juba, known to us by fame.
Perhaps we shall then be longing for these regions of the serpents;
the heavens, too, are productive of some comfort;
still, something does live.
I seek not the fields of my native land, and Europe, be­ holding other suns, and Asia;
under what part of the sky, in what region, Africa, did I leave thee ?
At Cyrene, even still was the winter freezing.
In so small a distance do we change the course of the year?
We are proceeding towards the opposite pole;
our world we leave behind;
our backs we present to be smitten by the southern blasts1.
Now, perhaps, is Rome herself beneath our feet2.
This solace in death do we ask;
let the enemy come, and let Cæsar follow whither we fly.
"Thus does enduring patience disburden itself of its com­ plaints ;
the extreme valour of their leader compels them to endure hardships so great, who lies extended on the bare sand, and at every hour challenges Fortune.
In all vicissi­ tudes he alone is at hand;
and, wherever he is called, thither he flies, and a great boon, and one larger than health, does he confer-strength to undergo death;
and they are ashamed;
he the witness, to die uttering groans.
What power over him could any misery have?
Sorrows in the breast of another does he subdue, and, a looker on, he shows that mighty pains are powerless.
Hardly did Fortune, wearied with dangers so great, grant them a tardy aid in their wretchedness.
A single nation inhabits the land, unhurt by the cruel sting of the serpents, the Marmarian Psylli3;
their tongues are equal to powerful drugs;
their very blood is safe, and can admit no venom, even their charms unemployed.
The nature of the place has commanded, that, mingled with the serpents, they should be unharmed.
It has profited them to have placed their abodes in the midst of venom.
Peace has been made between them and death.
So great is their confidence in their blood;
when a little babe, newly born, falls upon the earth, fearing lest there may be any contamination by foreign intercourse, they test the doubtful offspring by the deadly asp ;
and as the bird of Jove, when from the heated egg it has brought forth its unfledged young ones, turns them to the rising of the sun;
those which can endure the rays, and with direct glance can sustain the light of heaven, are preserved for rearing;
those which flinch from Phœbus, it leaves exposed;
so does the Psyllian consider it a pledge of its origin, if any infant does not shudder at the snakes when touched, if any one plays with the pre­ sented serpents.
Nor is that race only contented with its own safety;
the Psyllian is on the watch for strangers, and assists people against the hurtful monsters.
And these, then following the Roman standards, as soon as the general ordered the tents to be pitched, in the first place, purged the sands which the compass of the trenches enclosed, with charms and words that put the snakes to flight.
A fire made with drugs surrounds the extremity of the camp.
Here does wall-wort crackle, and foreign galbanum1 steam, and tamarisk2 rejoicing in no foliage, and eastern costus, and pungent all-heal, and Thessalian centaury3;
and sulphur-wort resounds in the flames, and the thapsus of Eryx4.
Larch-trees, too, they burn, and southern-wood, with its smoke stifling to serpents, and the horns of stags bred afar.
Thus is the night made safe for the men.
But if any one in the day receives the fatal sting from the pest, then are the miracles of the magic nation seen, and the mighty struggle of the Psylli and of the imbibed venom.
For, in the first place, he marks the limbs by the contact of spittle, which restrains the virulence, and retains the poison in the wound.
Then, with foaming tongue, he hurries over many a charm in a continuous murmur, nor does the rapid spread of the wound give time for breathing, or death allow him for an instant to be silent.
Full oft, indeed, the venom, received into the blackening marrow, charmed forth, takes to flight;
but if any poison obeys too tardily, and, summoned forth and commanded, refuses to depart, then, lying down upon the pallid wounds, he licks them, sucking the poison with his mouth, and squeezes the limbs with his teeth, and, holding the deadly matter drawn forth from the cold body, spits it out;
and even from the taste of the poison it is quite easy for the Psylli to tell what serpent's bite it is that has taken effect.
Relieved, then, at last, by this aid, the Roman youth wandered far and wide in the glowing fields.
Phœbe, her flames twice laid aside1, her light twice recovered, rising and departing, beheld Cato wandering on the sands.
And now for them, more and more did the sands begin to harden, and Libya, growing more compact, to return to glebe.
And now afar a few branches of woods began to raise themselves;
and rude cottages of piled-up reeds to appear.
How great joy in their wretchedness did it afford them by reason of an improved land, when first they beheld, facing them, the savage lions2!
Leptis was nearest3 at hand, in whose harbour they passed a quiet winter, devoid of clouds and heat.
When Cæsar, satiated with the Emathian slaughter, with­ drew, the other weights of care he threw aside, thinking of his son-in-law alone;
vainly tracking whose footsteps seat­ tered throughout the dry land, rumour his guide, he resorted to the waves, and coasted along the Thracian straits, and the sea famed for love 1, and the tower of Hero on the tearful shore, where Helle, daughter of Nephele2, took away its name from the deep.
Not anywhere do the waves of a more limited tract of water divide Asia from Europe, although Pontus,.
by a narrow channel, divides Byzantium3 and Chalcedon 4, that produces the purple, and Propontis, carrying along the Euxine, rushes from a small mouth.
An admirer, too, of glory, he seeks the Sigæan sands, and the waters of Simois, and Rhœteum, ennobled5 with the Grecian tomb, and the ghosts that owe6 so much to the Poets.
He goes around the 'name of burnt Troy, and seeks for the vast traces of the Phoebean wall.
Now have barren woods and crumbling trunks of oak overwhelmed the abodes of Assaracus, and they take hold upon the Temples of the Gods with roots now wearied;
and the whole of Pergamus is covered with brambles;
even the ruins are gone.
He beholds the rocks of Hesione1, and the concealed groves, the nuptial retreat of Anchises2;
in what cave:
!
the umpire took his seat;
from what spot4 the boy was carried to tho heavens;
upon what mountain height the Naiad Œnone disported3;
no rock is there without a name6.
Un­ knowingly he passed over a rivulet creeping along the dry sand, which once was Xanthus.
Unthinkingly he was placing his step in the thick grass, a Phrygian native forbade him to tread upon the ghost of Hector.
Torn asunder lay the stones, and showing no appearance of aught that was sacred, "Dost thou not behold," said the guide, "the Hercæan altars?"70 sacred and mighty labours of the Poets, all things do ye rescue from fate, and immortality do ye bestow on mortal men!
Cæsar, be not touched with envy at their hallowed fame;
for if it is allowable to promise aught to the Latian Muses, so long as the honors of the Smyrnæan Poet shall last, those to come will read both me and thee 8;
my Pharsalia will survive, and by no age shall we be condemned to obscurity.
When venerable antiquity had satisfied the view of the chieftain, he erected momentary altars with piles of turf heaped-up, and poured forth these prayers over flames that burned frankincense, to no purpose :
­ "Ye Gods who guard 1 these ashes, whoever haunt the Phrygian ruins;
and ye Lares 2 of my Æneas3, whom now the Lavinian abodes and Alba preserve, and upon whose altars still does the Phrygian fire glow, and Pallas, by no male beheld4, the memorable pledge of empire in the hidden shrine, the most illustrious descendant of the Julian race offers on your altars the pious frankincense, and solemnly invokes you in your former abodes :
grant me for the future a fortunate career.
I will restore the people5;
in grateful return the Ausonians shall return to the Phrygians their walls, and a Roman Pergamus shall arise.
"Thus having said, he seeks the fleet once more, and gives full sail to the prospering Cori;
and desirous, the gale speeding him on, to compensate for the delays of Ilium, he is both carried past powerful Asia Minor, and leaves Rhodes behind with the foaming main.
The seventh night, Zephyrus never allowing the ropes to flag, shows by the Pharian flames the Egyptian shores.
But rising day obscures the torch of the night, before he enters the still waters.
There he hears the shores filled with tumult, and con­ fused voices with uncertain murmurs;
and, hesitating to entrust himself to a doubtful power, he keeps the ships off from the shore.
But a courtier 1, bearing the dreadful gift of the monarch, launching forth into the mid sea, carries the head of Magnus, concealed in a Pharian mantle, and first with impious words justifies the crime :
— " Subduer of the earth, greatest of the Roman race, and, what as yet thou dost not know, secure, thy son-in-law slain;
the Pellæan monarch spares thee thy labours by land and by sea, and bestows on thee what alone has been want­ in,- to the Emathian arms :
for thee in thy absence has the civil war been finished.
Magnus, seeking to repair the Thessalian ruin, lies prostrate by my sword:
with a pledge so mighty, Cæsar, do we purchase thee;
by this blood has a treaty been concluded with thee.
Accept the realms of Pharos, obtained with no bloodshed.
Accept the rule of the streams of Nile, accept whatever thou wouldst give for the head of Magnus;
and deem him a dependant worthy of thy camp, to whom the Fates have willed that there should be power so great over thy son-in-law.
And think not this merit worthless, in that it has been acquired by an easy slaughter.
He was the friend of his grandsire;
to his banished parent he had restored the sceptre.
Why mention more?
Thou shalt find a name for an exploit so great;
or at least consult the fame of the world.
If it is a crime, confess that thou dost owe the more to us, in that thou thyself dost not commit this crime.
"Thus having said, he uncovered the concealed head and held it up.
The features, now languid in death, had changed the expression of the well-known face.
Not at the first sight did Cæsar condemn the gift, and turn his eyes away;
his looks were fixed upon it until he recognized it.
And when he saw that there was truth in the assertion of the crime, and thought it safe now to be an affectionate father- in-law, he poured forth tears that fell not of their own ac- cord, and uttered groans from a joyous heart 1, not think­ ing otherwise to conceal the transparent joyousness of his mind than by tears;
and he cancelled the vast merit of the tyrant, and chose rather to mourn the severed head of his son-in-law, than to be under an obligation for it.
He, who with features unmoved had trodden upon the limbs of Senators2, who with dry eyes had beheld the Emathian plains, to thee, Magnus, alone, dares not refuse a sigh.
0 most unhappy turn of fate!
Didst thou, Cæsar, pursue him with accursed warfare who was worthy to be bewailed by thee ?
Do not the ties of the united families influence thee, nor thy daughter and grandchild 3 bid thee mourn ?
Dost thou suppose that among the people who love the name of Magnus this can avail thy cause?
Perhaps thou art moved with envy of the tyrant, and art grieved that others have had this power over the vitals of the ensnared Magnus, and dost complain that the revenge of war has been lost, and that thy son-in-law has been snatched from the power of the haughty victor.
Whatever impulse compels thee to weep, far from true affection does it differ.
With these feelings, forsooth, art thou hunting over land and sea, that nowhere thy son-in-law, cut off, may perish ?
0 how fortunately has this death been rescued from thy award!
How much criminality has sad Fortune spared the Roman shame, in that, perfidious man, she did not suffer thee to have compassion on Magnus when still alive!
Still further, in these words does he presume to dissemble, and he gains credit for the grief pretended by his countenance :
­ "
Remove, courtier, from my sight, the melancholy gift of thy king;
worse has your wickedness deserved from Cæsar than from Pompey.
The sole reward of civil war, to give safety to the vanquished4, have I lost.
Were not his sister hated1 by the Pharian tyrant, I might have given to the king in return what he has deserved, and have sent, Cleopatra, thy head in return for such a present
Why has he wielded2 secret arms, and intruded his own weapons into my task ?
Did we create a sway for the Pellæan sword in the Thessalian fields?
Was licence sought for in your realms ?
I would not en­ dure Magnus ruling the Roman destinies together with me;
Ptolemy, am I to put up with thee ?
In vain have we in­ volved nations in civil war, if in this earth there is any other power than Cæsar;
if any land belongs to two.
I would have turned the Latian prows from your shore;
but regard for my fame forbids it, lest I should seem not to have con­ demned, but to have dreaded the blood-stained Pharos."
And do not suppose that you can deceive me, the con­ queror.
For us as well was provided the like hospitality on your shores.
That my own bead is not borne in like fashion, the fortune of Thessaly causes.
With greater danger, in truth, than could be dreaded, did we wield arms in the conflict;
of exile and of the threats of my son-in-law and of Rome did I stand in dread;
Ptolemy was the punisher of defeat.
But I spare his years, and forgive him the crime.
Let the tyrant know that for this murder nothing more than pardon can be granted.
Do you bury in the tomb the head of a chieftain so mighty;
but not alone that the earth may hide your guilt;
give frank­ incense to the sepulchre, his due, and appease the head, and collect the ashes scattered on the shore, and give but one urn to the dispersed shades.
Let the ghost be sensible of the arrival of his father-in-law, and hear his affectionate voice as he complains."
Since he preferred everything to me, since his life he had rather owe to his Pharian dependant, a joyous day has been snatched away from nations;
our reconcilement has been lost to the world.
My prayers have been denied fa­ vouring Gods, that, embracing thee, Magnus, my victorious arms laid aside, I might beg of thee thy former affection and thy life3;
and, content with a sufficient reward of my labours, to be thy equal, then, by an enduring peace, I would have caused that, though conquered, thou mightst have been able to forgive the Gods, thou wouldst have caused that Rome would have been able to forgive me.
"Having thus said, he neither found a sharer in his grief, nor did the multitude believe him thus complaining;
they suppressed their sighs, and concealed their feelings by joyous features, and dared with delight to behold the blood- stained deed, (0 happy freedom J) while Cæsar mourned1.
Cæsar, although finding the people of Egypt hostile to him, comes to Alex­ andria, and visits the tomb of Alexander the Great, 1-19.
The Poet inveighs against Alexander and the people of the East, 20-52.
In the meantime Ptolemy comes to Cæsar as an hostage;
Cleopatra also obtains admission to him by stratagem, 53-60.
The Poet utters maledictions against Cleopatra, 61-81.
Cleopatra entreats Caesar to protect her and her brother against the power of Pothinus, 82-103.
Caesar assents.
The luxury of the Egyptians is described, 104-135.
The dress and beauty of Cleopatra are depicted, and the sumptuousness of the banquet, 136-171.
At the feast Cæsar addresses Achoreus, the chief priest, on the subject of the Egyptian Gods and the sources of the Nile, 172-192.
Achoreus first combats the false notions that exist on the rise of the Nile, 193-261.
And then states his own opinions on the subject, 252-331.
Potbinus plans the death of Caesar with Achillas, 332-398.
Collecting his soldiers, Achillas surrounds the palace, 399-443.
Caesar orders the gates to be closed, and detains the king as a hostage, 444-4 67.
The palace is besieged, 468-484.
The valour of Caesar is described.
The ships of the enemy being burnt, Cæsar takes possession of Pharos, 485-509.
Pothinus is put to death, 510-519.
Arsinoë, the younger sister of Ptolemy, slays Achillas, 519-529.
Ganymedes, the newly-appointed general, actively wages the war against Caesar, and the work concludes, 530-546.WHEN
Cæsar, following the head of Pompey 1, first reached the shore, and trod upon the direful sands, the fortune of the chieftain and the fate of guilty Egypt struggled, as to whether the realms of Lagus should come under the Ro­ man sway, or whether the Memphitic sword should snatch from the world the head of both conqueror and con­ quered.
Magnus, thy shade prevailed2, thy ghost rescued thy father-in-law from bloodshed, that after thee the Roman people might not esteem the Nile.
Thence is he borne into the Parætonian city3, secure in the pledge of a crime so ruthless, following his own insignia1.
But, in the shouts of the mob complaining that the fasces and the Roman authority are encroach­ ing upon their own, he perceives discordant breasts and doubtful feelings, and that Magnus has perished not for him.
Then, his looks always concealing his fears2, without hesitation he goes about the abodes of the Gods of heaven and the Temples of the ancient Divinity3, that attest the former strength of the Macedonians;
and, touched by no beauty of the objects, not by the gold and the rites of the Gods, not by the walls of the city, he eagerly descends into a cavern dug out among the tombs.
There, the mad offspring of Pellæan Philip, the fortunate robber, lies interred, snatched away by Fate4, the avenger of the earth.
The members of the man that should have been scattered over the whole globe they placed in a shrine.
Fortune spared his shade, and the fortunes of his kingdom lasted until recent times5.
For, if Liberty had ever taken unto herself the earth, as a laughing-stock he would have been kept, shown as no useful precedent to the world, that countries so numerous could be under a single man.
The limits of the Macedonians and the lurking-holes of his own people he forsook, and Athens, subdued by his father, he despised;
and driven onward through the nations of Asia by the impelling fates, amid human slaughter he rushed on, and thrust his sword through all nations;
unknown streams he stained, the Euphrates with the blood of the Persians, the Ganges tcith that of the Indians a deadly mischief to the earth, and a thunderbolt that shook all peoples alike, and a star male­ volent to nations.
Fleets he was preparing to launch on the ocean in the Outer Sea1.
No heat withstood him, nor waves, nor sterile Libya, nor Ammon 2 on the Syrtis.
To the west he would have gone, following the incline of the world, and he would have compassed the poles, and have drunk of Nile at its source;
his last day met him, and nature alone was able to put this period to the frantic.
King;
who, with the same greed with which he had taken the whole earth, bore off with himself the empire, and, no heir to all his fortune being left, gave the cities to be rent asunder3.
But he died, feared in Babylon, his own, and by the Parthian.
0 shame!
the Eastern nations dreaded the lances more close at hand, than now they dread the javelins 4.
Though we reign even beneath Arctus, and frequent the abodes of Zephyrus and lands behind the back of scorching Notus, we shall yield in the East to the lord of the descendants of Arsaces.
Parthia, not fortunate to the Crassi, was a secure province to little Pella.
Now, coming from the Pelusian5 mouth of the Nile, the effeminate boy king had appeased the wrath of the unwarlike multitude;
who being the security for peace, Cæsar was safe in the Pellæan court;
when, in a little two-oared boat, Cleopatra, the guard having been bribed to loosen the chains1 of Pharos, betook herself, unknown to Cæsar2, to the Emathian abodes3;
the disgrace of Egypt, the fatal Erinnys of Latium, unchaste, to the undoing of Rome.
As much as did the Spartan female by her fatal beauty bring ruin on Argos and the homes of Ilium, so much did Cleo­ patra increase the frenzy of Hesperia4.
She, if so it is allowable to say, alarmed the Capitol by her sistrum, and with unwarlike Canopus attacked the Roman standards5, about to conduct the Pharian triumph, Cæsar her captive a;
and doubtful was the event on the Leucadian main7, whether in fact a woman should not hold our sway.
This pride did that night create which first united in the couch with our chieftains the unchaste daughter of Ptolemy.
Who will not, Antony, grant thee pardon for thy frantic passion, when the hardy breast of Cæsar caught the flame, and in the midst of frenzy and the midst of fury, and in a palace haunted by the shade of Pompey, the paramour, sprinkled with the blood of the Thes­ salian carnage, admitted Venus amid his cares, and mingled with his arms both illicit connexion and issue not by a wife ?0 shame!
forgetful of Magnus, to thee, Julia, did he give brothers1 by an obscene mother;
and, suffering the routed faction to unite in the distant realms of Libya, he disgrace- fully prolonged his stay for an amour of the Nile, while he was preferring to present her with Pharos, while not to conquer2 for himself.
Confiding in her beauty, Cleopatra approaches him, sad without any tears, arrayed for simu­ lated grief, so far as is consistent with beauty, as though tear­ ing her dishevelled hair, and thus she begins to speak :
­ "
If there is, 0 most mighty Cæsar, any nobleness, I, the most illustrious offspring of Pharian Lagus, an exile for everlasting, expelled from the sceptre of my father, a queen, embrace thy feet, if thy right hand may restore me to my former destiny.
A gracious Constellation to our race thou dost appear.
I shall not be the first woman to rule the cities of the Nile;
making no distinction of sex, Pharos knows how to endure a queen.
Read the last words of my de­ ceased father, who gave me common rights to the sway, and a union with my brother.
That boy, if only he were free, loves his sister;
but he holds his inclination and his sword under the control of Pothinus.
Nothing of my paternal rights do I myself ask to gain;
from a censure and a stain so great do thou free our house;
remove the ruthless arms of the courtier, and command the king to rule.
What swelling pride does the menial feel in his mind, the head of Magnus struck off!
Now (but may the Fates avert that afar!) he even threatens thee.
Cæsar, disgrace enough has it proved to the world and to thee that Pompey has been the guilt and the merit of Pothinus.
"In vain would she have appealed to the obdurate ears of Cæsar, but her features aid her entreaties, and her unchaste face pleads for her.
A night of infamy she passes, the arbitrator being thus corrupted.
When peace was obtained by the chieftain3 and purchased with vast presents, feast- ing crowned the joyousness of events so momentous, and Cleopatra amid great tumult displayed her luxuries, not as yet transferred to the Roman race.
The place itself was equal to a Temple, which hardly a more corrupt age 1 could build;
and the roofs adorned with fretted ceilings displayed riches, and solid gold concealed the rafters.
Nor did the palace shine resplendent, encrusted with marble on the surface and in sections;
the agate and the purple stone 2 stood of themselves in no infirm way a;
and, laid down throughout the whole palace, onyx was trodden upon.
Ebony from Meroë4 did not cover the massive posts, but it stood as though common oak, the support, and not the ornament of the palace.
Ivory covers the halls, and backs of Indian tortoises, fastened by the hand, are placed upon the doors, dotted in their spots with plenteous emeralds.
Gems shine upon the couches, and the furniture is yellow with jasper ;
the cover­ lets glisten5, of which the greater part, steeped long in the Tyrian dye, have imbibed the drug not in one cauldron only6.
A part shines, embroidered with gold;
a part, fiery with cochineal7, as is the method of mingling the threads in the Pharian webs.
And then, the number of the servant train and the attendant crowd !
Some, the blood differing in colour, others, their ages had distinguished;
this part has Libyan hair, another part has hair so light, that Cæsar declares that in no regions of the Rhine has he seen locks so bright;
some are of scorched complexion, with curly hair, wearing their locks thrown back from their foreheads.
Unhappy youths, as well, rendered effeminate by the iron, and deprived of virility.
Opposite stands an age more robust, still with hardly any down1 darkening the cheeks.
There do kings recline, and Cæsar a still higher power;
and having immoderately painted up her fatal beauty, neither content with a sceptre her own, nor with her brother her husband 2, covered with the spoils of the Red Sea3, upon her neck and hair Cleopatra wears treasures, and pants beneath her ornaments.
Her white breasts shine through the Sido­ nian fabric, which, wrought in close texture by the sley of' the Seres4, the needle of the workman of the Nile has se­ parated, and has loosened the warp by stretching out the web.
Here do they place circles5, cut from the snow-white teeth in the forests of Atlas, such as not even when Juba was captured, came before the eyes of Cæsar.
O frenzy, blind and maddened by ambition, to him who is waging a civil war to disclose one's own riches, to inflame the mind of an armed stranger!
Although he were not prepared in accursed warfare to seek riches in the downfall of the world;
set there the ancient chieftains and the names of poorer days, the Fabricii and the grave Curii;
here let that humble Consul6 recline, taken away from the Etrurian ploughs, he would long to gain for his country a triumph so great.
They poured forth the viands into gold, whatever the earth, whatever the air, whatever the sea and the Nile afforded, whatever luxury, raging with vain ambition, had sought in the whole earth, hunger not demanding it.
Both many birds and many wild beasts did they set before them, the Gods of Egypt;
and crystal supplied the water of the Nile for their hands;
and capacious bowls, studded with gems, received the wine, but not of the grape of Mareotis, but noble Falernian 1, to which in a few years Meroë had im­ parted maturity, compelling it, otherwise full of roughness, to ferment.
They received chaplets wreathed with the flower­ ingmard2, and the never-fading rose;
and upon their drip­ ping locks they poured forth plenteous cinnamon, that had not yet faded in the air nor lost its scent in a foreign land.
The fresh amomum, too, of the adjacent harvests was brought.
Cæsar learnt how to waste the wealth of the despoiled world, and was ashamed to have waged war with a poor son-in-law, and longed for a cause of strife with the Pharian race.
After pleasure wearied with feasting and with wine had put an end to the revelry, Cæsar began with long discourse to prolong the night, and in gentle words addressed the linen-clad Achoreus3, who reclined at the highest seat :
­ “0 aged man, devoted to sacred rites, and, what thy age proves, not neglected by the Gods, disclose the origin of the Pharian race, and the situation of the country, and the manners of the people, and the rites and the forms of the Gods;
and relate whatever is engraved4 in characters in the shrines of ancient days, and reveal the Gods that are willing to be known.
If thy forefathers taught Cecropian Plato1 their rites, what stranger was there ever more worthy to be heard than this one, or more able to scan the world?
Rumour, indeed, about my son-in-law brought me to the Pharian cities, but still about yourselves as well.
Always in the midst or battles have I spared time for the courses of the stars and of the heavens and for the Gods above, nor shall my year2 be surpassed by the Calendar of Eudoxus3.
But although aspirations thus great exist beneath my breast, thus great is my love of truth, there is nothing that I would rather wish to know than the causes of the stream4 that have lain hid through so many centuries, and its unknown head.
Let me have an assured hope of seeing the sources of the Nile, I will forego civil war.
"He had finished, and on tho other hand thus began the sacred Achoreus:
— “Let it be allowable for me, Cæsar, to disclose the secrets of my mighty forefathers, hitherto unknown to the profane multitude.
Let it be piety to others to be silent on miracles so great;
but I deem it pleasing to the inhabitants of heaven for these works to be disclosed to all, and for the sacred laws to be revealed to nations.
To the planets, which alone modify the course of the heavens and run counter to the sky, a different power was given by the original laws of the world.
The sun divides the seasons of the year, he changes the day for the night, and with his powerful rays forbids the stars1 to move onward, and modifies their wandering courses in their track.
The moon, by her changes, mingles Tethys and the regions of the earth.
To Saturn has fallen2 the cold ice and the snowy zone.
The winds and the un­ certain thunderbolts has Mars.
Under Jove is a moderate temperature, and an atmosphere never rendered dense.
But fruitful Venus holds sway over the seeds of all things;
the Cyllenian Goda is the ruler of the boundless waves.
When the part of the sky has received him where the stars of the Lion are mingled with the Crab, where Sirius puts forth his glowing fires, and where the Circle, the changer of the varying year4, possesses Ægoceros and the Crab, placed beneath which the mouths of the Nile lie concealed;
when the ruler of the waters has smitten these with his fires hover­ ing above, then does the Nile, its fountains opened, spring forth, just as the ocean, bidden at the increase of the moon, moves on, and it does not check its own increase before the night has recovered the hours of summer from the sun.
"Vain was the opinion of the ancients that the snows of the Ethiopians aid the Nile for it to swell upon the fields.
No Arctos is there5 in those mountains, or any Boreas.
Your witness is the colour itself of the scorched people, and the south winds warm with vapours.
Be­ sides, every head of a river, which thawed ice hurries onward, on the approach of spring, swells with the first washing away of the snow;
but the Nile neither raises its waves before the rays of the Dog-star, nor confines its stream to the banks before Phœbus is equalled with the night, under Libra for arbitrator.
From this, likewise, it knows not the laws of other streams:
nor does it swell in the winter, when, the sun far removed, the wave performs not its duties1;
ordered to give a moderate temperature to the oppressive weather, in the midst of summer it comes forth.
Under the torrid tracts, lest fire should impair the earth, the Nile comes to the aid of the world, and swells in opposition to the inflamed face of the Lion;
and, the Crab scorching its own Syene, implored it comes:
nor does it liberate the fields from the waves until Phœbus declines in the autumn and Meroë extends the shades.
Who can ex­ plain the causes?
Thus has the parent Nature commanded the Nile to run;
thus has the world need of it.
“The Zephyrs, also, does antiquity vainly allege as the cause of these waters, the times of whose blasts are fixed and the days continuous, and of long duration is their sway over the air;
either because from the western sky they drive so many clouds beyond the south, and compel the showers to hover over the river;
or because so often they beat back with constancy the waters of the Nile when bursting forth at the sea-shore2, and compel the waves to flow back.
Through the impeding of its course, and the re­ sistance of the opposing sea2, it overflows upon the plains."
Some there are who think that there are channels in the earth, and vast inlets in the hollow structure.
This way through secret courses does the water glide from the interior, attracted to the mid region of the earth from the arctic colds, when Phœbus presses upon Meroë, and the scorched earth thither draws the waters.
Both Granges and Padus are drawn through the secret regions of the world.
Then is Nile, discharging all the rivers from one source, unable to give them vent at a single mouth."
There is a report that from the Ocean which bounds all lands, overflowing, the impetuous Nile breaks out afar, and that the salt of the sea becomes tasteless from the length of the course."
Besides, we believe that both Phoebus and the sky are fed by the Ocean;
it, when he has touched the claws of the heated Crab, the sun draws up, and more waters are raised than the air can digest.
This do the nights draw back, and discharge again into the Nile.
"But I, Cæsar, if it is permitted me to dispose of a question so great, imagine that certain waters, since the last ages of the completion of the world, burst forth from the ruptured veins of the earth, God not willing it, and that certain waters at the very creation took their origin with the universe, which last the Creator himself and the Maker of things restrains by certain laws.
“The desire that thou hast of knowing the Nile, 0 Ro­ man, existed both in the Pharians and in the Persians and in the tyrants of the Macedonians;
and no age is there that has not wished to bestow the knowledge on posterity;
but still does its propensity for concealment prevail.
Alexander, the greatest of the kings whom Memphis adores, envied the Nile its concealment, and sent chosen persons through the re­ motest regions of the land of the Æthiopians;
them the red zone1 of the scorched sky kept back, they beheld the Nile warm.
Sesostris came2 to the west and to the extremities of the world, and drove the Pharian chariots over the necks of kings;
still, Rhone and Padus1, of your streams did he drink at their sources before the Nile.
The mad Cambyses came to the long-lived people2 in the East, and, falling short of food and fed by the slaughter of his men, he re­ turned, Nile, thee undiscovered."
No lying fable has dared to speak about thy source.
Wherever thou art seen, thou art enquired into;
and the glory falls to no nation's lot for it to be joyous over the Nile its own.
Thy streams will I disclose so far as, Nile, the God, the concealer of thy waves, has granted me to know of thee.
From the southern pole dost thou rise, ven­ turing to raise thy banks towards the scorching Crab ;
to­ wards Boreas and the midst of Bootes dost thou go straight onward with thy waters;
then with windings is thy course turned towards the west and the east, now favoring the tribes of the Arabians, now the Libyan sands;
and thee do the Seres3 first see, yet even these, as well, seek to trace thy source;
and with a foreign stream thou dost beat upon the plains of the Æthiopians, and the earth knows not to what region it is indebted for thee.
Thy hidden source nature has not disclosed to any one, nor has it been allowed peoples to behold thee, Nile, but small;
and thy springs has she removed, and has willed rather that nations should wonder at than know thy sources.
“At the very solstice it is thy privilege to rise, and, winter removed, to increase, and to bring on wintry floods of thy own;
and to thee alone is it permitted to wander be­ tween each pole.
At the one is sought the rising, at the other the end of thy waters.
Far and wide with thy divided stream is Meroë surrounded, fruitful for black husbandmen, joyous with the foliage of the ebony tree;
which, although it is green with many a tree, moderates its summer with no shade1, so straight through the Lion does that line of the world2 cut.
Thence art thou conveyed past the tracks of Phœbus, suffering no loss of thy waters3, and long dost thou wander along the desert sands, at one time collecting all thy might into a single stream, at another wandering and undermining the banks that readily yield to thee."
Again does thy sluggish channel recall the waves, divided into many parts, where Philæ, the key4 of the kingdom, divides the fields of Egypt from the tribes of the Arabians.
Next, a gentle course speeds thee on, cutting through the deserted regions, where the track of commerce5 divides our sea from the Red.
Who,
Nile, could suppose that thou, so gently flowing, couldst arouse such mighty anger of a stream so impetuous ?
But when the abruptness of the path and the precipitate cataracts have intercepted thy passage, and thou art indignant that any rocks should resist thy waters nowhere forbidden, then with foam dost thou chal­ lenge the stars;
all sides roar with thy waters;
and with a vast murmur of the mountains does the foaming river grow white with unconquered waves."
After this, a powerful land, which our revered antiquity styles AbatosG, assaulted by it, feels the first attacks, and the rocks which they have thought fit to call the springs of the river, because they first give the manifest signs of its recent swelling.
After this, nature has placed mountains around the wandering waves, which, Nile, deny theo to Libya;
among which, in a deep valley, the waves now speed on, lying within dams thus regained.
First does Memphis allow to thee the fields and the open country, and forbid banks to place an obstacle to thy increase.
"Thus without care, as though in the safety of peace, do they prolong the course of midnight;
but the frenzied mind of Pothinus1, once stained with blood so sacred, does not rest from the contemplation of crimes.
Magnus slain, no­ thing does he now deem to be wickedness;
his ghost dwells in his breast, and the avenging Goddesses direct his frenzy to new misdeeds.
He is for gracing vile right hands with that blood2 as well, with which Fortune is preparing to drench the vanquished Senators;
and punishment for the civil war, vengeance for the Senate, is almost granted to a slave.
Avert afar, ye Fates, this crime, that, Brutus absent, this neck should be smitten!
The punishment of the Roman tyrant is going to be counted a Pharian crime, and the example is being lost.
Audaciously did he plan things not purposed by the Fates;
nor did he prepare to entrust the murder to secret fraud, and in open warfare he challenged the unconquered chieftain.
Courage so great did his crimes afford that he gave orders to strike off the head of Cæsar, and thy father-in-law, Magnus, to be joined unto thee;
and he bade faithful slaves to carry these commands to Achillas, his partner in the murder of Pompey, whom the weak boy had appointed over all arms, and had given to him the sword, against all and against himself as well, no authority being retained for himself:
­ “Now lie down on thy bed," said he, " and enjoy sound slumbers;
Cleopatra has surprised the palace.
Nor has Pharos been betrayed1 only, but given away.
Dost thou de­ lay, alone, to run to the couch of thy mistress ?
The guilty sister is married to her brother, guilty, I say, for already is she married to the Latian chieftain;
and running to and fro between her husbands she sways Egypt and has won Rome.
Cleopatra has been able to subdue an old man by sorceries;
trust, wretched one, a child;
whom if one night shall unite with her, and he shall once, submitting to her embrace with incestuous breast, satisfy an obscene passion under the name of affection, probably between each kiss he will be granting to her myself, and thy own head.
By crosses and by flames shall we atone for it, if his sister shall prove beauteous3.
No aid remains on any side;
on the one hand there is the king the husband, on the other, Cæsar the paramour.
"And we are, though I confess it, convicted before so vengeful a judge;
which one of us will Cleopatra not deem guilty, with regard to whom she has been chaste ?
By the deed which we jointly committed, and did in vain4, and by the treaty ratified by the blood of Magnus, do thou come ;
with a sudden outburst arouse the warfare;
rush on by night;
let us quench the marriage torches in death;
and the cruel mistress let us slaughter in the very bed with either husband.
Nor let the fortune of the Hesperian chief­ tain deter us from the enterprise.
The glory which has elevated him and set him over the earth is common to ourselves;
us, too, does Magnus render illustrious.
Look upon the shore, the hope of our guilt;
consult the stained waves what we may attempt;
and behold a tomb with its little sand covering not even all the limbs of Pompey.
He whom thou dost dread was but his peer.
"We are not illustrious in blood;
what matters?
Nor do we wield the resources of nations and the sway of kings:
we have mighty powers for criminality.
Fortune betrays them into our hands.
Behold, another more noble victim comes!
Let us by a second murder propitiate the Hes­ perian nations.
The divided throat of Cæsar can afford this for me, that the Roman people will love us, though guilty in the death of Pompey.
Why do we shudder at names so great, and the forces of the chieftain, which, left behind, he will be but a common soldier ?
This night will put an end to the civil wars, and will offer an appeasing sacrifice to the people, and will send to the shades the head which is still due to the world.
Rush fiercely upon the throat of Coesar;
let the Lagæan band do this for their king, the Roman for themselves.
Do thou forbear delay­ ing ;
filled with the banquet and drenched with wine, and prepared for lust, thou wilt find him;
dare the deed;
the Gods of heaven will bestow on thee the fulfilment of so many aspirations of the Catos and of the Bruti.
"Achillas is not slow to obey one persuading to villany.
To his camp, about to be moved, he does not give, as is the wont, a loud signal, nor does he betray his arms by the sound of any trumpet;
in his temerity he employs all the ap­ purtenances of savage warfare.
The greatest part of the multitude are of the Latian commonalty, but so great obli­ viousness has taken possession of their minds, the soldiers being corrupted by foreign manners, that they can serve under a slave for their general, and under the command of a de­ pendant of the court, whom to obey the Pharian tyrant it would have disgraced.
No faith and piety is there in men who follow camps, and let out for a little money their venal hands, there the right is where are the highest wages1;
and they engage to attack the life of Cæsar not for them­ selves.0 right!
where has not the wretched fate of our empire met with civil war?
Troops far removed from Thessaly rage after the manner of their country on the banks of the Nile.
What more, Magnus, thyself received with hospitality, could the house of Lagus have dared?
Every right hand performs, forsooth, that which is due to the Gods of heaven;
and to no Roman is it permitted to be unemployed.
Thus has it pleased the Gods to rend the Latian body;
the people do not separate in partisanship for the father-in-law and the son-in-law:
a dependant on a court arouses the civil war, and Achillas sides with a faction of the Romans.
And un­ less the Fates avert their hands from the blood of Cæsar, this faction will prove the conqueror.
Ready prepared did each2 come, and, engaged in feasting, the palace was exposed to all treachery, and the blood of Cæsar might have been poured forth amid the royal cups, and his head have fallen on the table.
But they feared the startling alarms of war in the night, lest the slaughter, promiscuous and sanctioned by the Fates, might, Ptolemy, destroy thee.
So great was their confidence in the sword.
They did not hasten on their guilt;
the opportunity for a deed so momentous was despised;
it seemed to the slaves a, loss that might be made good to let that hour pass for slaying Cæsar.
To pay the penalty in open light was he reserved.
One night was granted to the chieftain, and Cæsar, reprieved till the rising of Phœbus, lived by the favour of Pothinus.
Lucifer looked down from the Casian rock, and sent the day over Egypt, warmed even by the rising sun, when, afar from the walls, troops were beheld, not scattered in maniples, nor yet unmarshalled, but just as they march with straight front against an equal foe.
Ready to stand the attack hand to hand and to make it, they rushed on.
But Cæsar, dis­ trusting1 the walls of the city, protected himself within the gates of the closed palace, submitting to an unworthy re­ treat.
Nor for him, pent up, was the whole palace avail­ able ;
in the smaller portion of the house he had collected his forces;
both anger and fear affected their minds;
he both dreaded the onset and he disdained to dread.
Thus rages the noble brute confined within the narrow cage, and, the prison gnawed, breaks his frantic teeth;
not otherwise would thy flames grow furious, Mulciber, in the caverns of Sicily, if any one were to block up the summits of Ætna2 for thee.
He who, in his boldness, so lately be­ neath the heights of Thessalian Hremus, feared not all the nobles of Hesperia and the ranks of the Senate and Pom­ pey their leader, the cause forbidding3 him to look at them, and promised for himself an unmerited success, dreaded the guilty attempts of slaves, and within a house4 was as­ sailed with darts;
he, whom not the Alanian would have provoked, not the Scythian, not the Moor, who sports with the stranger fastened up5;
he, for whom the space of the Roman world does not suffice, and who deems the Indians with the Tyrian Gades a trifling realm, just like an un­ warlike boy, just like a woman in a captured city, seeks the safe retreats of a house;
his hope of life be places in a closed threshold, and, wandering about with uncertain steps, surveys the halls;
not without the king, however, whom he takes in every quarter with him, to exact vengeance and a grateful expiation for his death, and determined to hurl, Ptolemy, .thy head against the slaves, if there be not darts or flames.
Thus is the barbarian fair one of Colchis be­ lieved, fearing the avenger both of his kingdom and of her flight, with her sword and with the head of her brother as well, ready prepared, to have awaited her father.
However, the emergency of affairs forces the chieftain to have recourse to hopes of peace;
and a royal attendant2 is sent to corrupt the slaves in the name of their absent mo­ narch, to tell by whose advice they commenced the attack.
But neither does the law of the world3 avail, nor the ties that are ratified by nations.
The ambassador of the king and the pleader for peace, guilty of so many misdeeds, gives proof of what is to be placed in the number of thy crimes.
Not the Thessalian land, and the vast realms of Juba, not Pontus, and the impious standards of Pharnaces, and the region flowed around by the cold Iberus, not the barbarian Syrtis, have perpetrated crimes so great as thy effeminacy.
The warfare presses him on every side, and now within the house the darts are falling, and the household Gods are trembling.
No battering-ram is there to move the threshold at a single shock, and to break down the house;
no engine of war is there;
nor is the work entrusted to flames;
but the troops, devoid of counsel, straggling, surround the vast abode, and nowhere does a body attack with its entire force.
The Fates forbid, and Fortune, in place of a wall, defends Cæar.
With ships likewise1 is the palace attempted, where the luxurious abode extends itself with proud extremities into the midst of the waves.
But Cæsr is present everywhere defending, and these does he keep from entering with the sword, those with flames;
and, blockaded (so great is his presence of mind), he does the work of the besieger.
He orders torches dipped in pitch and fat to be hurled against the sails in the joined barks.
Nor is the fire slow amid shrouds of tow and amid planks dripping with wax;
and at the same moment do both the benches of the sailors and the topmost ropes of the sailyards catch fire.
Now almost are the half-burnt ships sunk in the deep, and now both enemies and weapons are floating.
Nor on the ships alone do the flames take hold;
but the roofs which are near to the sea, with extending smoke, catch fire.
The south winds, too, feed the destruc­ tion, and the flame, smitten by a whirlwind, runs along the roofs with no other motion than a meteor is wont to run along the æhereal track, both lacking fuel, and burning in the desert air.
This disaster for a short time called away the people from the besieged palace to the aid of the city.
Nor did Cresar lose the moments for destruction in sleep, but in the darkness of the night he leapt aboard ship, always success­ fully employing the sudden turns of war and the opportunity seized.
Then he took Pharos, the key to the main.
Once did it stand as an island in the mid sea, at the time of the prophet Proteus;
but now it is adjoining to the Pellæan walls.
A double aid in war did that afford to the chieftain:
it cut off the power of making incursions and the outlets of the main from the foe;
and to the aid of Cæsar, it left an inlet and free access to the sea.
Nor then did he any further delay the punishment of Pothinus;
but not with the wrath his due, not with the cross, not with the flames, not with the ravenous teeth of wild beasts.
Oh shame !
his bead unbecomingly struck off with the sword1 atoned ;
he died by the death of Magnus!
Moreover, escaping by a stratagem2 prepared by the slave Ganymedes, Arsinoë goes over to the foes of Cæsar;
and she holds the camp deprived of its monarch, as the offspring of Lagus, and pierces the grim Achillas3, the slave of the king, with a righteous sword.
Now, Magnus, another victim is dispatched to thy shade;
nor does Fortune deem this enough.
Afar be it, that this should be the sum of thy vengeance.
Not the tyrant himself suffices for retribution, not the whole palace of Lagus.
Until the swords of his country reach the vitals of Cæsar, Magnus will be unre­ venged.
But, the author of the commotion removed, the frenzy did not cease ;
for again did they have recourse to arms, under the guidance of Ganymedes4;
and many battles did they fight with successful warfare.
That day might, with fatal results to Cæsar, have been handed down to fame and to future ages.
His arms being crowded within the compass of a slight rampart, while the Latian chieftain is preparing to disem­ bark his forces in empty ships, he is surrounded with all the dangers of a sudden attack;
on the one side, numerous ships line the shores;
on the other, foot soldiers are attack­ ing in the rear;
no way is there for safety, no flight, no room for valour;
hardly, even, is there the hope of an honorable death.
With no army routed, and with no heaps of vast carnage, was Cæsar then about to be conquered, but with no bloodshed, captured through the fatality of the spot.
He hesitates whether, in his doubt, to fear, or whether to wish to die.
He recollects Scæva1 amid the- dense mass, who had already earned the glory of everlasting fame, Epi­ damnus, on thy plains, when, alone, the ramparts thrown open, he besieged Magnus treading upon the walls2ABATOS, the island of, 397.
