WE have heard, in the Introduction to the Ecclesiazusae, of the position to which Athens was reduced by the disastrous termination of the Peloponnesian War;
of the bold step which she took, after nine years of humiliation, to regain her independence by entering into the anti- Spartan League;
and finally of the marvellous revival of her fortunes under the auspices of Conon.
That able officer arrived at Athens in the year B. c. 393, after a prolonged sojourn, in conjunction with the Persian satrap Pharnabazus, at the Isthmus of Corinth.
There the army of the League was stationed;
and there Conon was in constant communication with the leaders of the League.
One important result of their conferences was the establishment by Conon of a Foreign Legion, τὸξενικὸν, a force of foreign mercenaries in connexion with the allied army at Corinth, but always under the immediate command of an Athenian general.
The troops which composed the Legion seem to have been levied in Asia, and to have accompanied Pharnabazus and Conon in their adventurous voyage through the Aegaean to ravage the Laconian sea-board 1.
Conon himself was no doubt their commander during the operations of the fleet;
but his connexion with them must have terminated when they were disembarked and affiliated to the army at Corinth, or at all events so soon as a new Athenian general could be appointed in his place.
His successors in the command, however, were men of remarkable ability ;
and under the skilful generalship of Iphicrates the Legion distinguished itself in the following year by destroying a Spartan μóρα.
Meanwhile the reconstruction of the Athenian navy was also proceeding apace.
During the nine years of subordination to Sparta it was limited to twelve triremes, but already before the date of the Plutus (not five years after the intervention of Conon) it was again becoming a formidable and ubiquitous power.
We find Thrasybulus leading forty ships to the Hellespont (immediately after a squadron of ten had been destroyed by Teleutias);
whilst eight more were subsequently sent under Iphicrates to the same destination;
Eunomus led thirteen to Aegina;
and a squadron was stationed off the coast of Acarnania, of sufficient magnitude to prevent any attempt on the part of Agesilaus to return from Calydon to the Peloponnese by the open sea 1.
Athens was rapidly regaining the position, not indeed of an Imperial City, but of a first-class and conspicuous Hellenic State.
Doubtless a start in this resuscitation of her power was made with the Persian gold which Conon had brought to Athens.
But the Athenians themselves, unassisted as they now were by the tribute of their allies, must have made very great sacrifices to complete and sustain the work.
The question of Aristophanes Does it not require Wealth to man the triremes, and maintain the Foreign Legion at Corinth ?
must have found an echo in many an Athenian heart.
And very welcome to the whole audience must have been the restoration of Wealth, at the close of the Comedy, to his long-deserted home in the Athenian Treasury.
Such was the position of Athens when the play before us was exhibited.
Aristophanes had indeed twenty years before1 (B. c. 408, in the archon­ ship of Diocles) produced a Comedy bearing the name of the Πλοῦτος, but there is no reason for believing that it resembled in the slightest degree the Comedy which has come down to ourselves.
We may be sure that it was a political or literary satire, adorned with a Parabasis, and enlivened with a liberal supply of Choral melodies.
It appeared midway between the Lysistrata and the Frogs, in what may be termed the specially lyrical period of the poet's career, a period extending from the Peace to the Frogs.
And it is inconceivable that he should at that date have written a Comedy bearing any resemblance to the present in tone or character.
Only one short passage of the First Plutus remains.
It is quoted by the Scholiast on Frogs 1093 as ἐν Πλούτῳ πρώτῳ, and runs as follows-
See the Commentary on that line of the Frogs.
The other notices which the Fragment Collectors attribute to the First Plutus consist of seven expressions (ἀναπηρίαν,βλὰξ, γραίζειν, ἐμπαίζειν, ζυγοποιεῖν, ἦν 8' ἐγὼ, and ῥνφῆσαι which the grammarians ascribe to 'Αριστοφάνης Πλούτῳ, and which are not found in the existing play.
We may therefore leave the First Plutus out of our consideration as having in all probability an entirely different plot carried out in an entirely different manner;
merely remarking that in two plays on the same subject, however independent of each other, it is more than probable that there will occur, here and there, some slight points of contact.
See the Commentary on Eccl. 926.
The present Comedy was exhibited in the spring of B, c. 388, during the archonship of Antipater.
We do not know whether it was produced at the Great, or at the Lenaean, Dionysia, or with what success :
but we know that there were now five competitors instead of three, which had been the limit during the Peloponnesian War.
For with the deaths of Euripides and Sophocles, the great stream of Tragic song which had rolled on with undiminished vigour for nearly a century became well-nigh dried up ;
there were still plenty of poetasters attempting to write Tragic plays (μειρακύκλλια τραγῳδιας ποιοῦντα, Frogs 89), but there was no real successor to the great Triumvirate :
and it was found necessary to repro­ duce on the stage again and again the dramas of the three dead Masters.
But Comedy, though changing its character, grew more and more ;
and as if to compensate for the dwindling interest of Tragedy, there were now five Comedies instead of three to compete for the prize at the Dionysian festivals 1.
The four poets who competed with Aristophanes on this occasion were Nicochares with the " Laconians,”Aristomenes with the "Admetus," Nicophon with the “Adonis,” and Alcaeus with the " Pasiphae."
A few unimportant words from the “ Laconians ” and the " Pasiphae " have come down to our times :
but the “Admetus ”and the “Adonis " are not elsewhere mentioned.
This was the last play which Aristophanes produced in his own name :
but there seems every reason to believe that he afterwards revised it and exhibited the revised edition in the name of his son Araros, For the author of the Greek Life of Aristophanes tells us 2, in the most explicit terms, that he brought out the Plutus in the name of Araros, for the purpose of commending him to the Athenian People (ἐν τούτῷ TW δράματι συνέστησε τῷ πλήθει τὸν υἱὸν 'Αραρότα).
And though the passage in the Third Argument 1 relating to Araros yields no sense as it stands, it is by no means improbable that it was intended to convey precisely the same information in very similar words, and to mean-And this being the last Comedy Aristophanes produced in his own name, and wishing by its means to commend his son Araros to the audience (καὶ TOP νἱὸν αὑτοῦ συστῆσαι ’Αραρότὸταδἰ αὐτῆς τοῖς θεαταῖς βουλόμε νος) he brought it out again, as well as the two remaining Comedies, the Cocalus and the Aeolosicon, in his son's name.
Of course we are not to suppose that there was a Third Plutus;
there was merely a double representation of the Second, just as there was a double representation of the Frogs and of the Aeolosicon, and a double edition of the Clouds.
The play introduced by Araros would be sub­ stantially the play introduced by Aristophanes, but would be revised and touched up here and there, where the taste of the poet himself or perhaps the criticisms of others suggested a slight alteration.
And this theory may serve to explain a difficulty which has long perplexed commentators and critics;
the difficulty arising from the fact that the Scholiasts on the extant Comedy suppose themselves to be commenting on the First Plutus, the play of 408.
For in my opinion the Scholiasts had before them two Plutus-plays;
the extant Comedy, and the revised edition brought out in the name of Araros;
and as they knew only of a First and a Second Plutus (the plays of 408 and 388), they fell into the natural error of supposing the earlier of their two plays -the extant Comedy-to be the First Plutus, the play of 408;
and the revised edition to be the Second Plutus, the play of 388.
It may be desirable to refer in more detail to the scholia 1 which give rise to the question.
Thus, on line 115, where Chremylus tells Wealth that he trusts ταήτἡςἀπαλλάξειν σε τῆς ὀΦθαλμας,the Scholiast observes 2 that ὀφθαλμία which properly signifies a mere disease of the eye is here used, in a peculiar sense, for blindness j and that therefore in the Second Plutus, the line was changed into τῆς συμφορᾶς ταύτης σε παύσειν ἧς ἕχεις.
Now this is plainly a mere verbal alteration made in revising a continuing play ;
the structure of the sentence is left altogether unchanged;
and no variation is made in the language beyond what was absolutely necessary to get rid of an objectionable word.
This is exactly what might be expected to happen in the revision of the extant Comedy for Araros;
it could hardly have happened in writing a second play on the same subject as the first.
(2) On line 173 τὸ 8' ἐν Κορίνθῳ ξενικὸν the Scholiast perceives the chronological difficulty which would arise if the play on which he is commenting were, as he imagines, the First Plutus.
It is plain, he says 3, that this line must have been transferred from the Second Plutus which was exhibited twenty years later [than the play on which he supposed himself to be commenting].
There, he continues, it would be chronologically right;
for the Corinthian War took place three or four years before the archonship of Antipater;
[in which archonship, as we know, the extant Comedy was exhibited]. (3) On line 179 the SchoIiast 1 accuses Aristophanes of an anachronism in speaking of the love of Lais for Philonides;
for she was only fourteen years old in the archonship of Diodes, [that is, in 408 when the First Plutus was produced].
(4) On line 972 ov λαχοῦσ’ ἔπινες ἐν τῷ γράμματι;
the Scholiast, misunderstanding the allusion, remarks 2 that the βούλη sat for the first time κατὰ γράμμα in the year preceding the production of this play, for Philochorus says that it first did so in the archonship of Glaucippus.
[Now Glaucippus was the archon before Diocles.] (5) And finally on line 1146 where the reference is to the capture of Phyle by Thrasybulus, the Scholiast says 1 that this had not happened at the date of the play;
it did not happen till five years later.
[It occurred in the archonship of Pythodorus, 404-403.]
And he therefore supposes that this line also must have been transferred from the Second to the First Plutus,It is plain therefore that the Scholiasts supposed the play on which they were commenting to be the First Plutus (the play of 408) ;
and that they had before them a later Plutus which they supposed to be the play of 388.
But in truth the play on which they were commenting was the extant Comedy, the play of 388, and their later Plutus was the revised edition brought out in the name of Araros.
The mistake of the Scholiasts was, I suppose, responsible for the strange theory put forward 2 by Kuster and Brunck, viz. that the Comedy which has come down to us is neither the First Plutus nor the Second Plutus, but an amalgam of both.
The first editor who attempted to arrange the eleven surviving Comedies in their chronological order was Bekker, and he in his edition placed the Plutus immediately before the Frogs.
But whilst Bekker's work was passing through the press, a dissertation was published by Francis Hitter, in which he went carefully through the various notes of time contained in the extant Comedy, and pointed out, as the fact is, that alleits historical allusions are to events which occurred subsequently not only to the archonship of Diodes, but even to the Fall of Athens.
And his conclusion that we have before us, in accordance with the didascalia, the Comedy as originally exhibited in the year 388 is now universally accepted.
His dissertation was published at Bonn in the year 1828, and is prefixed in a condensed form to Dindorfs notes on the Plutus.
But Ritter further expressed an opinion that the Comedy which the Scholiasts designate as the later of their two Plutus-plays, was none other than the First Plutus, the play of 408.
He can hardly have taken into account the vast difference between a Lyrical Comedy of the earlier date, and our existing Plutus.
It is inconceivable that, with these two plays before them, they could have supposed the extant Plutus to have been produced twenty years before the Lyrical Comedy.
And I believe that the true solution will be found in the foregoing pages.
The Ecclesiazusae and the Plutus arc the only extant Comedies which were produced after the downfall of the Athenian Empire.
There was an interval of twelve years between the Frogs and the Ecclesiazusae, but only five years intervened between the latter play and the Plutus.
And it is not merely a question of time.
Between the date of the Frogs and the date of the Ecclesiazusae the whole face of the Attic world had been changed ;
the political forces, the hopes and fears, which were in operation at the date of the earlier Comedy had passed away for ever;
old enemies had become new friends ;
and new ambitions and new ideas had sprung up on every side.
But nothing of similar importance had occurred between the date of the Ecclesiazusae and the date of the Plutus;
the two plays run in the same groove ;
and bear numerous traces of having been composed under the same circumstances and during the same period.
I lay no stress on the fact, which some have pointed out, that a few simple words are found in both these Comedies, and nowhere else in Aristophanes;
for there are no two plays, however widely separated in point of time, in which some coincidences of this kind may not be discovered ;
it is far more important to observe that the same topics and the same historical surroundings which were most prominent in the poet's mind when he wrote the Ecelesiazusae still held a place there when he wrote the Plutus.
Agyrrhius and the ἐκκλησιατικὸν, the dole for attendance at the Public Assembly which Agyrrhius was the first to introduce, and which he finally raised to three obols,—the increased attendance at the Assemblies consequent on that increase of pay,—Neocleides, one of the regular speakers in the Assembly, his blindness and how to cure it,—Thrasybulus and the unfortunate change in the public sentiment towards that distinguished citizen-the proceedings of the anti-Spartan League at Corinth—the practice of evading military service by pretending to be an ἔμπ
ορος,—the degradation of Aristyllus—the misery of dying without leaving enough for one's funeral-these are some of the topics which were present to the poet's mind as well when he was writing the Plutus as when he was writing the Ecclesiazusae.
And this indeed would be an additional proof, if any further proof were required, that our Comedy is the Plutus which was produced in 388.
And everywhere in the play before us we find tokens of the change which is passing over Athenian Comedy.
The stately Parabasis is gone;
the beautiful lyrics which elevated the whole performance into a higher and purer atmosphere have altogether disappeared;
the great historical personages, literary and political, the poets, the philosophers, the dema­ gogues, the generals, who moved through the earlier scenes of the Aristophanic drama, have faded not only from his own satire, but almost from the very recollection of his audience :
we are no longer amidst the pomp and glory, the boundless activities of Imperial Athens with her Imperial instincts and her splendid ambitions;
comedy has become social instead of political;
the performers might almost be treading, so to say, the boards of some provincial theatre.
But I am not one of those who can trace some decay in the wit and vigour of the poet himself.
If we can imagine one of his earlier plays denuded of all these accessories, I do not think that the Plutus would compare unfavourably with what would remain.
Take for instance the scene with the Informer in the Birds and the scene with the Informer in the Plutus.
It seems to me that the latter is far the wittier, the more vigorous, and the more dramatic of the two.
The material and surroundings of Comedy have changed;
the comic force of the poet remains unchanged.
The idea on which the Comedy turns is one which in the ancient world was frequently perplexing the wisest minds.
How is it that the ungodly are often seen in great prosperity while the righteous are needy and poor?
This question the Comic poet answers with a Comic jest.
It must be because Wealth is blind (as the poets commonly feign him), and therefore unable to distinguish between the wicked and the good.
Let his sight be restored and all will be well:
he will visit the righteous, and keep far off from the ungodly.
No sooner said than done.
Wealth is taken to spend the night in the Temple of Asclepius, and " when the day dawned " (to use the formula found in the Asclepian inscriptions) " he went away cured.”
At once the tables are turned :
the positions are reversed;
the righteous become wealthy, and the wicked are ruined.
There is yet a second stage, which now and then unexpectedly makes itself felt, in this revolution.
When Wealth has deserted the wicked, and gone over to the righteous, the former will find it to their interest to become righteous too, so that finally all men will become both righteous and wealthy, and Poverty will cease out of the land.
This second result is only brought forward occasionally;
notably in the discussion with Poverty herself, and in the complaint of the Priest at the conclusion of the play.
Throughout the Comedy there is a continual interchange between the two significations of the word πλου̃τος, viz.
Wealth and the God of Wealth;
and if in the translation the God were called Plutus, this ever-recurring humour would be entirely lost.
Retaining therefore for the play itself the title of the “ Plutus " I have in the translation everywhere called the God by the name of Wealth;
a proceeding which might be considered in questionable taste, if it were not in reality a matter of necessity.
Wealth, we have seen, recovered his eyesight by the simple expedient of passing a night in the Temple of Asclepius;
and Aristophanes takes the opportunity of putting into the mouth of the slave a very vivid and graphic, if a somewhat farcical, account of the proceedings which took place in one of those famous health-resorts.
We have no means of ascertaining which is the particular Temple in which the cure is supposed to have been effected.
Philocleon, in the Wasps, was ferried across to Aegina;
and though there seems to have been now, even if there was not then, a Temple of Asclepius in Athens, and indeed another in the Peiraeus, yet they do not appear to have become noted as health-resorts, and it seems to me most probable that Wealth too is supposed to have been taken to Aegina.
However others are of a different opinion;
and the question is not very material;
for doubtless the same course was pursued in all these health-resorts.
It may not be out of place here to say a few words on the subject of Asclepius and his cures.
Epidaurns was, in historic times, the head-quarters and metropolis of the Asclepian worship;
but the original home of that worship appears to have been at Tricca, in north-west Thessaly.
There according to Strabo was the oldest Temple of Asclepius;
and it was from Tricca1 that “ his two sons, the kindly physicians, Podaleirius and Machaon” led out their troops to take part in the expedition against Troy.
And although the Epidaurians contended that Asclepius, the son of Apollo and Coronis, was born within their boundaries, and their contention was upheld by Apollo himself in a response from his oracular shrine at Delphi2, yet even so the priority of the Thessalian claim was recognized by the admission that Coronis was the daughter of Phlegyas, the Thessalian king, and was merely on a temporary visit with her father to Epidaurus when she gave birth to the child.
However in the end Epidaurus overshadowed and superseded Tricca;
it was only in Epidaurus that the yellow snakes3, sacred to Asclepius, were supposed to be found;
and all the most celebrated Asclepian sanctuaries1 (excepting Tricca) were derived from thence.
Aegina, which we have already mentioned, and Cos, which we shall presently mention, were both colonized from Epidaurus;
and it was from Epidaurus too that the Athenians first adopted the worship of Asclepius.
So again, a century later, when the Romans, after a three- years pestilence, resolved to appeal for assistance to Asclepius, it was to Epidaurus, as a matter of course, that they were directed to go 2.
And the story went that as the deputation were leaving that town on their return journey, one of the sacred Epidaurian serpents glided into their ship, and accompanied them back to Rome, We may safely con­ sider the Epidaurian sanctuary to be the fairest representative of these Asclepian health-resorts;
more especially since, while the investigations into the ruins of the Asclepieia at Cos and at Athens have brought to light many traces of reconstruction and of alterations in their general scheme, the Epidaurian buildings appear to have retained throughout the form in which they were originally constructed.
The Epidaurian sanctuary, called TO ἱερὸν ἅλσος rod ’Ασκληπιου̑ by Pausanias, and still called Sto Ier6, ἐς τὸ ἱερὸν, is rather more than four and a half miles (five Roman miles 3) inland from the town, at the north- eastern end of a valley which is there inclosed by a semicircle of steep and wooded hills 4.
It lies, as it were, in a recess at the extremity of this valley, partly surrounded by the hills, and separated from the rest of the valley by a wall the remains of which are still visible.
The traveller from the town has to cross the hills:
the entrance to the valley is at its south-eastern extremity.
The sanctuary is something less than a mile in circumference, comprising therefore, presumably, nearly forty acres.
This space contained a variety of buildings;
the Temple of Asclepius himself, with his statue in ivory and gold;
beyond the Temple 1 (that is, I suppose, adjoining it on the side nearest the hills) the great dormitory in which the patients slept;
a Rotunda of white marble, which Pausanias calls the Θόλος ;
shrines of Artemis, Aphrodite, and Themis;
a stadium;
a theatre constructed by Polycleitus, and in the opinion of Pausanias superior to all others in its charm and the beauty of its proportions;
for who, says he, can in these matters vie with Polycleitus ?
and many other erections.
Pausanias2 tells us that within the enclosure were certain pillars (of which only six were standing in his time but formerly their number was greater) whereon were inscribed the names of men and women cured by Asclepius, and from what diseases they suffered, and in what manner they were cured.
And he adds that these inscriptions were written in the Doric tongue.
And in another place he calls them " the Cures of Asclepius," του̑ ’Ασκληπιου̑ ra ἰάματα.
These pillars were apparently in the open air;
but within the building itself were tablets, πίνακες, containing lists of these Cures.
" Epidaurus,” says Strabo 3, “ is a city by no means undistinguished;
chiefly on account of the mani­ festation of Asclepius there, who is believed to cure all manner of diseases, and whose sanctuary is always full of sick people, and of votive tablets recording the cures;
as is also the case at Cos and Tricca."
Epidaurus1, Cos, and Tricca seem to have been the most notable of these Asclepian health-resorts in the ancient world.
The accuracy of Pausanias and Strabo has been abundantly vindicated by the investigations of M. Kabbadias and his companions amongst the ruins of the Epidaurian sanctuary.
Amongst other discoveries they found an inscription which is entitled ’άματα του̑ ’Απόλλωνος καὶ ’Ασκληπιου̑ and contains a record of some twenty cures effected on suppliants sleeping in the dormitory there.
The inscription is set out in the ’Εφημερὶς ’Αρχαιολογικὴ for 1883 (published at Athens, 1884) from which I extract three cures which illustrate to some extent the proceedings in the sanctuary described in the present play,- Ambrosia of Athens, blind in one eye.
She came as a suppliant to the God, but walking round in the sanctuary, she scoffed at some of the cures as incredible and impossible, that the halt and the blind should be made whole, by merely seeing a vision in their sleep.
But she in her sleep saw a vision.
It seemed that the God stood over her and announced that he would cure her of her disease;
but that by way of payment she would have to present to the sanctuary a pig made of silver as a memento of her ignorance.
And when he had thus said he cut open her diseased eye and poured in a healing drug.
And when the day dawned she went away cured.
A man came as a suppliant to the God, blind in one eye in such wise that he had only the lids and nothing within them, but the socket was quite empty.
Then some of the folk in the Temple exclaimed at his folly, imagining that he could recover his sight, when he had not even the slightest commencement of an eye, but only an empty space.
But as he slept, there appeared to him a vision.
It seemed that the God prepared some drug, and then drawing the eyelids apart poured it in.
And when the day dawned, he went away, seeing with both eyes.
A man's toe was healed by a serpent.
This man, suffering grievously in his toe from a malignant ulcer, was brought forth while it was yet day by the attendants, and took his seat on a bench.
And when he had fallen asleep, a serpent issued out of the Temple, and licked his toe and healed it;
and when it had done this, it went back into the Temple.
And when he awoke, healed, he said that he had seen a vision;
it seemed as though a youth of comely appearance laid upon his toe a healing drug.
In this last case, the δράκων came out of the Temple into the adjoining dormitory, licked the part diseased, and then retired again into the Temple, exactly as the δύο δράκοντε in the Comedy did in the case of Wealth.
And it seems to me that the archaeologists must be wrong who suppose that the ἄβατον was the regular dormitory;
its very name implies the contrary;
nor would the serpents be kept in the dormitory;
nor would they have come out of the dormitory to heal the sleeping patient and afterwards returned to it again.
The dormitory was the large colonnade or area which adjoined the Temple;
and which at Epidaurus was 246 feet long by 31 wide;
and at Cos 330 by 210.
Doubtless in the summer months this στοὰ was crowded with patients;
and although it is possible that some sufferers were allowed to sleep in the Temple itself, τὸ ἄβατον, yet we may be sure that this was done only on some special occasions, such as in the great cold of winter (when too there would be but few ίκέται), or in the case of very delicate patients.
In investigating the sanctuary of Asclepius in Cos, there was discovered in the Temple-floor 1 “ a large rectangular coffer or cist composed of great slabs of marble, each a foot thick.
The coffer was about 5 feet long, 4 feet in breadth, and 3 feet in depth.
The massive block which formed the lid was pierced in the centre by an aperture 6 inches in diameter."
This coffer, Dr. Caton conjectures, was the place in which the sacred serpents were kept;
and there seems every reason to believe that his conjecture is accurate.
The serpents would ordinarily emerge through the aperture in the lid;
but whenever it might be thought necessary or convenient, the lid itself would be removed.
Cos too is supposed to be the scene of the Fourth Mime of Herodas.
Two ladies are bringing a cock as an offering to Asclepius, partly in gratitude for the present partial cure of some disease, and partly in hope of a more complete cure hereafter.
The day has not dawned and the shrine is not yet open.
They linger outside, saluting the statues of Asclepius himself, of his father and mother (Apollo and Coronis), and of the various members of his family (Hygieia, Panacea, Epio, Iaso, Podaleirius, and Machaon) ;
and considering in what position they shall affix the tablet recording the cure.
Presently the sacristan throws open the Temple door, and they go in, admiring the paintings there, as they had admired the statuary outside.
They then make their offering to the God, giving a leg of the cock to the sacristan, and pushing a πέλανος into the hole where the serpent dwells, ἐς τὴν τρώγλην του̑ δράκοντος (the serpent being a τρωγλοδύτης, Aristotle, H. A. ix. 2. 10).
The τρώγλη would doubtless be represented by the aperture in the lid of the coffer described by Dr. Caton as mentioned above.
This cult of Asclepius was perhaps the pleasantest part of the old Hellenic religion;
nor did its popularity fail until the final extinction of Paganism.
Still in the days of Constantine, men believed that at these famous health-resorts the patients were healed by a vision of the night, ἐπιφαινομένου νύκτωρ καὶ ἰωμένου TOV δαίμονος
1. Julian frequently refers to Asclepius, and in one of his orations swears by his name, νὴ τὸν ’Ασκληπιόν ;
an adjuration occasionally found in classical writers 2.Lucian, who is everywhere treading in the footsteps of Aristophanes, introduces Poverty and Wealth, Πενία and Πλου̑τος, as characters in his dialogue “ Timon";
and makes Poverty insist, as she does in the Comedy, on the superiority of her training to the training afforded by Wealth.
The Plutus was, I suppose, the first Aristophanic Comedy to become familiar in an English form to English readers.
Randolph's " Hey for Honesty, Down with Knavery” is described on its title-page as "a Pleasant Comedie.
Translated out of Aristophanes his Plutus by Thomas Randolph ";
and is prefaced by a dialogue between Aristophanes and his Translator.
It is in some scenes a fairly close and very good translation, mostly in prose, of the Greek original;
though in other places the translator loses touch with Aristophanes, and giving free rein to his fancy, introduces a farrago of wild buffoonery which is quite alien to the spirit of the Athenian drama.
It concludes with the marriage of Plutus and Miss Honesty.
Randolph's play was first printed in 1651 after the authors death.
It was soon afterwards acted (probably in 1652, says Isaac Reed) before a brilliant audience;
and it is interesting to observe that the part of the youth (Νεανίας) was on that occasion taken by Sir Christopher Wren3, then a B.A. of Wadham College about twenty years of age.
There have not been many translations of the Plutus into English verse.
I know of only three;
one by Edmund F, J. Carrington in 1825;
a second by Sir Daniel Sandford, published in Blackwood's Magazine, Vol. 38 (December, 1835);
and a third by Leonard Hampson Rudd, in 1867.
There is a prose translation, more vigorous than refined, by Henry Fielding the novelist and the Rev. William Young.
The Plutus, as we have seen in the earlier part of this Introduction, is not only the last extant Comedy of Aristophanes, it is also the last Comedy which he exhibited in his own name;
but it is not the last Comedy which he wrote.
He composed indeed two more, the Cocalus and the Aeolosicon, but these he intrusted to his son Araros, seeking by that means to introduce and commend him to the Athenian people;
a sign that the poet's popularity with his countrymen remained un­ diminished to the end.
There may possibly have been another reason for his handing over these two Comedies to his son.
For in them he was making a new departure, and substituting a humorous delineation of ordinary life and manners for the vigorous political, literary, and social satire which had been the animating principle of his earlier dramas.
The change had been foreshadowed in the Plutus;
but it was in these two plays that the ancient critics detected the germ of the later Comedy, the Aeolosicon representing the Middle, and the Cocalus the New, Comedy, the Comedy of Menander and Philemon.“
It was Aristophanes," says1 the author of the Greek Life, " who first exhibited the style of the New Comedy.
He did this in the Cocalus, whence Menander and Philemon took the cue for their dramatic work." " In the Cocalus," says the same writer2, “ he introduced the dramatic Seduction and Recognition, and all the other things which Menander imitated."
And it would seem from a statement of Clemens Alexandrinus 3 (as corrected by Casaubon), that the Cocalus itself was parodied and.
satirized by Philemon in his Comedy of the ‛Υποβολιμαι̑ς, the Supposi­ titious Son.
And the Aeolosicon is described by Platonius (περὶ διαφορα̑ς κωμῳδιω̑ν) as belonging to the type of the Middle Comedy.
A few fragments of the Cocalus have reached us, but not enough to enable us even to make a guess at the character and drift of the play.
The title is supposed to refer to the Sicilian prince1 of that name to whom Daedalus fled from the vengeance of Minos, and who, when Minos followed the fugitive to Sicily, contrived by treachery to destroy the pursuer, either he or his daughters having let boiling water into the bath where Minos was.
This is perhaps the more probable, because Aristo­ phanes had already written a Comedy bearing the name of Daedalus;
but of course it is altogether uncertain.
Of the Aeolosicon we can form a somewhat better idea.
Its title is derived from two proper names, Αἴολος and Σίκων.
Σίκων was a slaveys name (Eccl. 867);
and in a passage cited by Athenaeus (ix. 22) from a comedy of Sosipater it is the name of a cook, the founder of a great school of cookery.
And it is a cook's name in this Aristophanic Comedy.
We see him receiving his mistress's orders (like the cook in the Menaech­ mi) to provide what was required for a banquet;
and presently returning from his marketing with such a plenteous supply of provisions from the baker, the butcher, and the greengrocer that the guests, even if endowed with the voracity of a Heracles, will hardly be able to consume them unless they remain at the table the whole night through.
The fragments of the Comedy are thrown together in all the editions without regard to their relative positions.
I will arrange those relating to the cook in what I conceive to have been their sequence in the play itself.
First then, we have the cook starting on his marketing expedition-
Next we see him returning from Thearion the baker.
He announces his return in language borrowed from the first lines of the Hecuba- I come, relinquishing the baker’s shop Of old Thearion, where the bakemeats are 1.
Also he has purchased some roots of leek of a garlic-imitating quality-
And he has prepared some---what are they called ?
0 yes, some pettitoes so tender that they will melt in the mouth- (As to τὸ δει̑ν’ cf. Wasps 524, Peace 268, Birds 648, Lys. 921.)
Un­ fortunately in the course of his marketing, the money he had in his mouth has melted away,- So that now he has no small change left;
ἐν τῳ̑ Αἰολοσίκωνι τὸ μὴ ἔχειν κέρματα ἀκερματίαν ὠνόμασεν.-Pollux ix. 89. Now, however, he must get ready his culinary implements­ δοίδυξ, θυεία, τυρόκνηστις, ἐσχάρα.-Pollux x. 104.
But it will take the guests the whole night to get through the dainties he is preparing-
A. How shall we sup
On all this supper ?
B. All night long, perchance.
And this will require the voracity of a Heracles, ὃν ὡς γαστρίμαργον ’Αριστοφάνης κωμῳδει̑ ἐν Αἰολοσίκωι.—Scholiast on Peace 740.
But our Sicon was not merely a cook;
he was an Aeolus of a cook, an Aeolo-Sicon, just as Xanthias in the Frogs was a Heracleio-Xanthias.
On this side, the play was a satire on the notorious Aeolus of Euripides, a drama to which Aristophanes refers in the Clouds and the Frogs with indignant reprobation.
There, the children of Aeolus were represented as leading incestuous lives, in accordance with the legend preserved in the Odyssey.
Here, the daughters of Sicon were apparently represented as πόρναι, clad in the transparent vesture which indicated their profession, sleeping in one room, bathing in one bath, using lights as a signal to their lovers who would come swarming over the roof and through every opening.
And perhaps all those culinary preparations were for a riotous banquet for themselves and their lovers, and the woman who laid her commands upon Sicon may have been his wife or a daughter.“
There was a first and a second Aeolosicon of Aristophanes," says a Scholiast1 on Hephaestion chap.
ix, given by Gaisford in his third, but not in his first, edition, " just as there was a first and a second Plutus."
And Athenaeus also (ix. 13) expressly refers to the " second Aeolosicon."
It would be more accurate, in all probability, to compare the first and second Aeolosicon with the second Plutus and its revision, or with the first and second editions of the Frogs, than with the first and second Plutus.
But be this as it may, the second Aeolosicon, as well as the first, is both by the Scholiast on Hephaestion and by Athenaeus explicitly ascribed to Aristophanes himself, so that however quickly the second1 may have followed the first, it seems impossible to doubt that Aristophanes survived the exhibition of the extant Plutus for several years.
And then the great poet passed away full of years and honour.
He was born when the Athenian Empire was attaining its widest dominion ;
he had seen the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, the Peace of Nicias, the Sicilian catastrophe, the fall of Athens;
and he had lived to see the City he had served so well, again becoming, not indeed the mightiest, but the most splendid and the most notable of all Hellenic cities.
The year in which the poet died is as uncertain as the year in which he was born.
Many would place his death as soon after 388, the date of the present Comedy, as is compatible with the production in the mean­ time of the two subsequent plays, the Cocalus and the Aeolosicon;
but this is the merest conjecture.
On the other hand, Mr. Roland Kent in the able and interesting article to which reference has been made in the preceding note, would postpone it to, at the earliest, the year 375.
His argument is based on the following statement of Suidas :
— Araros, an Athenian, son of Aristophanes the Comic poet, and himself a Comic poet, having first exhibited in the JOIst Olympiad.
And he wrote the Καινεὺς, &c.
The 101st Olympiad extended from 376 to 372, the dramatic contests during that period taking place in the early months of 375 and the three following years.
Therefore, according to Suidas, Araros ἐδίδαξε for the first time in the spring of 375, at the earliest.
And as both the Aeolosicon and the Cocalus were undoubtedly exhibited in the name of Araros, Mr. Kent concludes that neither of them can have been exhibited before the spring of 375, and that Aristophanes therefore must at least have survived to that year.
But it seems to me that in the statement of Suidas, the signification of the word διδάξας is controlled by the immediate context.
It is introduced in connexion with the remark that Araros was himself a κωμικὸς, that is, a Comic poet, a composer of original Comedies.
The circumstance that his fathers comedies were brought out in his name would not entitle him to the name of a Comic poet.
Suidas then says, “He was himself a composer of original comedies having exhibited for the first time in the 101st Olympiad.”
And then he goes on to enumerate-what ?
Not the Comedies brought out in his name, but his original Comedies.
It seems to me that Suidas is throughout treating Araros as an original poet, and is not referring in any way to Comedies which were composed not by him but by Aristophanes.
And in my opinion we cannot say anything more precise about the date of the poet's death than that he was alive in the year 388, and must have lived for several years afterwards.

In each of these lines a comma should have been placed after the word νώ.
Page 33, line 265, note.
It might be more accurate to say that Aristophanes treats ὠπω̑ζε as if it were derived from ἐποι̑.
Page 189, line 1409, translation.
The line should commence " I get me wings."
And in the translation of line 1436 " Come " is misprinted " Cmoe.
"The scene, which remains unchanged throughout the play, represents a street in Athens, with the house of Chremylus in the background.
Groping along in front is a blind old man of very sordid appearance.
He is closely followed by an elderly citizen and his slave.
The citizen is Chremylus, and the slave, Cario;
and both are wearing on their heads wreaths of bay in token that they are returning from the oracle at Delphi.
And, indeed, the slave is carrying a piece of meat from the sacrifice which they have been offering there.
He is exhibit­ ing symptoms of impatience, and pre­ sently breaks out into the soliloquy with which the play commences.
What a bad job it is, says he, to serve a master who has lost his wits!
This is an aside, but he is equally free when he addresses his master to his face, calling him ὦ σκαιότατε and the like ;
quite in the style of the New Comedy, as we find it latinized in the plays of Plautus and Terence.4. μὴ δρα̑ν ταυ̑τα]
If the lord decide not to do what the servant advises.
By τω̑ν κακω̑ν we are to understand the evil con­ sequences (in which the servant as well as his master will be involved) of dis­ regarding the servant's advice.
Kuster refers to two lines of Philemon which are a mere echo of the present passage-CARIO.
How hard it is, 0 Zeus and all ye Gods, To be the slave of a demented master !
For though the servant give the best advice, Yet if his owner otherwise decide, The servant needs must share the ill results.
For a man's body, such is fate, belongs
Not to himself, but to whoe’er has bought it.
So much for that.
But now with Loxias, Who from his golden tripod chants his highThe opposite opinion is expressed in the Menaechmi of Plautus (ii. 3), where a slave endeavouring to dissuade his master from a foolish action is met with the retort:
Tace, inquam, Mihi dolebit, non tibi, si quid ego stulte fecero.σώματος ἕκαστος αὐτὸς έαυτου̑.-Scholiast.
And therefore a slave contending for his freedom was said περὶ του̑ σώμοτος ἀγωνίζεσθαι :
see the Introduction to the Frogs, pp. xi, xii. ἥλιος ὤν.-Scholiast.
But the former interpretation is improbable, and the latter impossible:
since Apollo was called Loxias long before he was identi­ fied with the Sun.
Bergler refers to Eur.
Or. 285 Λοξίᾳ δὲ μέμφομοαι.
The two characters in which Cario regards Loxias, torpor and pavIt, are as Span­ heim reminds us, united by Aeschylus in the one word ἰατρόμαντις, Eum. 62.21. στέφανον]
Wreaths of bay.
ἔθος ἦν, says the Scholiast, εἰς τὸν 'Απόλλω ἀπιόντας μετὰ
στεφάνωνἐντευ̑θεν άναχωρει̑ν.
See Lucian's Tragopodagra 75-7. Kuster refers to Oed. Tyr. 82, Eur. Hipp. 806, and the Scholiasts there;
and observes " Qui sacris eiusmodi coronis ornati erant, sancti quodammodo habe­ bantur, eosque violare nefas erat.”
Chremylus therefore retorts that he will strip Cario of his wreaths, and so notOracular strains, I've got a bone to pick.
A wise Physician-seer they call him, yet He has sent my master off so moody-mad, That now he's following a poor blind old man, Just the reverse of what he ought to do.

One who won't answer even with a gr-r-r.
I won't keep silence, master, no I won't, Unless you tell me why you're following him.
I'll plague you, Sir;
I know you won't chastise me
So long as I've this sacred chaplet on.
CHREMYLUS.
I'll pluck it off, that you may smart the more, If you keep bothering.
CAR.
Humbug !
I won't stop
Until you have told me who the fellow is.
You know I ask it out of love for you.
CH. I'll tell you, for of all my servants you I count the truest and most constant-thief.
—I've been a virtuous and religious man Yet always poor and luckless.
CAR.
So you have.
CH. While Temple-breakers, orators, informers,
And knaves grow rich and prosper.
CAR.
So they do.
CH.
So then I went to question of the God—merely deprive him of his immunity from punishment, but make him feel a blow on the head more keenly than he would if protected by the wreaths.29.
πένης ἦν] ΙΙολλοὶ yap πλουτευ̑σι κακοὶ, ἀγαθοὶ δὲ πένονται, as Solon says (Plutarch's Life of Solon, chap. 3).
And the line is found in Theognis also (315, Bergk).
But the observation is a common one in sacred as well as in profane writers.
30. ῥήτορες]
Observe the place which the "orators" hold amongst these scoundrels, and compare 567 infra.34.
ἐκτετοξευ̑σθαι]
My life's arrows are well-nigh all shot out;
that is, my life is almost spent;
a poetical expression, which we should expect to find rather in a lyrical poem than in a comic dialogue.
There is probably a play on the words βίος, life, and βιὸς, a bow;
see the note on Eccl. 563.37.
ὑγιὲς μηδὲ ἔν]
Rotten through and through;
good for nothing:
with no sound or wholesome element in it.
The neuter is here used of a person, as it was in Thesm.
394 τὰς προδότιδας, τὰς λάλους, j τὰς οὐδὲν ὑγιές.
The expression μηδὲν (or οὐδὲν) ὑγιὲς occurs no less than seven times in the present Comedy, and four times in the remaining plays.
Plato too often uses it, and it is frequently found in the writings of St. Chrysostom.
The general sentiment of this speech seems to be borrowed from Hesiod, W. and D. 270-72.39.
ἔλακενἐκ τω̑ν στεμμάτων]Droned, from amongst his wreaths of bay.
The word droned is not really a translation of ἔλακεν.
It is merely intended as an indication that the original refers to the high-pitched tone in which the Pythian priestess delivered the oracles of the God.
Of that tone shrilled or shrieked would be a more accurate representation, though less suitable to the language of Cario.
λάσκειν properly means to crackle, of inanimate things ;
or to scream, like a bird of prey.
And the Scholiasts think that Aristophanes is using it here, to make fun of its use by Euripides.
ή λέξις Εὐριπίδον, says one, ἀντὶτου̑ ἔχρησε.
And another τραγικώτερονΤΟVTO ἐξ Εὐριπίδου, διασύρων .

For such as they, methinks, succeed the best.
CAR.
And what droned Phoebus from his wreaths of bay ?
CH.
He told me plainly that with whomsoe'er I first forgathered as I left the shrine, Of him I never should leave go again, But win him back, in friendship, to my home.
CAB.
With whom then did you first forgather ?
CH. Him.CAR.
And can't you see the meaning of the God, You ignoramus, who so plainly tells you Your son should follow the prevailing fashion ?ἐκ χρυσου̑ λακὼν I φοīβός μ’ἔπεμψεδευ̑ρο.
And cf. Orestes 330.
The expression ἐκ τρίποδος there is equivalent to ἐκ τω̑ν οτεμμάτων here;
οἱ yap τρίποδες, says the Scholiast, δάφνη̩ ἦσαν ἐστεμμένοικαὶἡ προφη̑τις.
Kuster refers to Lucretius i 740 Pythia quae tripode ex Phoebi lauro­ queprofatur.
However, λάσκειν had b een used in the same sense by Sophocles, Trach. 824.41.
ξυναντήσαιμι]
There is possibly, as Bergler suggests, a dim reference to a passage in the Ion of Euripides (534- 6) where Xuthus emerging from the Temple of Delphi, and at once lighting on Ion, tells him of the oracle he has just received from Loxias, to the effect that the first person he meets as he leaves the Temple will be his own son.
o δὲ λόγος τίς ἐστὶ φοίβου ;
asks Ion, and Xuthus replies τὸν συναντήσαντάμοι .. .
δόμων τω̑νδ’ ἐξιόντι του̑ θεου̑ ... παȋδ’ ἐμὸν πεφυκέναι.
The speech of Xuthus is broken up into fragments because (for more than thirty lines) he is restricted to the second half of the trochaic tetra­ meter, the first half being allotted to Ion.46.
σαφέστατα]
Chremylus had said supra 40, that the God had answered him σαφω̑ς.
Cario, adopting the word, says that he had declared his meaning σαφέτατα.47.
ἀσκεȋν τὸν υἱόν]
That your son should practise.
ἀσκεȋν is of course to be taken in the same sense here as three lines below, and everywhere else in Aristo­ phanes.
I cannot understand why Dr. Blaydes and others should translate it educate filium, an error long ago exposed by Fischer.48.
δη̑λον ὁτιὴ K.T.X]
Because this seems plain even for a blind man to know:
a slight expansion of the common pro­ verbial saying τυφλῷ δη̑λον.
The γνω̑ναι is superfluous, παρέλκει, in this passage, exactly as in 489 infra.50.
ἐν τῷ νυ̑ν βίῳ]
As life is constituted at present.
The idea is expanded in 500 infra ὡςμὲν γὰρ νυ̑ν η̒μῑν o βίος Toȋs ἀνθρώποις διάκειται.63.
δέχου K.T.X.]
Take the man for your friend, and the ὄρνιν, that is, the φωνὴν (see Birds 720, 721, and the note there), as applicable to yourself.
The friend is yours, and the omen too.
Chremylus is so incensed by the retort of Wealth, and the taunt of Cario, that he "shows a hasty spark" of anger, very unlike his usual tolerance;
so un­ like, indeed, that some take from him the whole, and some the latter half, of line 65, and transfer it to Cario.
But for this there is not the slightest necessity:
the MS.
arrangement is far better;
Chremylus often gives vent to these little ebullitions of temper.
CH.
Why think you that?
CAR.
He means that even the blind Can see His better for our present life
To be a rascal, rotten to the core.
CH.
’Tis not that way the oracle inclines, It cannot be.
'Tis something more than that.
Now if this fellow told us who he is, And why and wherefore he has come here now, We'd soon discover what the God intended.
CAR.

Hallo, you sirrah, tell me who you are, Or take the consequence !
Out with it, quick !
WEALTH.
Go and be hanged !
CAR.
0 master, did you hear
The name he gave ?
CH.
'Twas meant for you, not me.
You ask in such a rude and vulgar way.

WE.
Get out, you vagabond!
CAR.

Answer this instant or you die the death.
WE.
Men, men, depart and leave me.
CH.
Wouldn't you like it ?
Timaeus,in his Lexicon, explains ὦ τα̑ν by ὦ, οὖτος, and ὦ οὖτοςby ὦσύ.
Whether, in passages like the present, ὦ rav, being followed by a verb in the dual or plural, is itself to be taken as applicable to more than one person, is very uncertain.
And it seems more probable that it is a case of transition from a singular to a plural (or dual), as in the familiar use of εἰπέ μοι.
Thus in Peace 383 εἰπέ pot, τί πάσχετ’ ὦνδρες;
and in Birds 366 εἰπέ pot, τί μελλετ’;
However the Platonic Scholiast and Suidas say πολλάκις καὶ ἐπὶπλήθουςφασὶ τὸ ὦ τα̑ν, ὡς rap'a Κτησι­ φω̑ντι.
And the Scholiast here, and Suidas, cite from Cratinus, ἆρά γε, ὦ rav, ἐθελήσετον;
There is no mention else­ where of a comic poet called Ctesiphon ;
and Ruhnken (on Timaeus) would alter the name to the more familiar Nico­ phon, who exhibited a Comedy in com­ petition with the Plutus.
The retort of Chremylus, πώμαλα;
is exactly equiva­ lent to πόθεν;
is it likely ?
an interroga­ tive implying an unqualified negative coupled with some surprise that an affirmative could have been thought possible.
The Scholiast calls it an Attic form, in which case it would represent πω̑ς μάλα:
Harpocration and Photius a Doric form, no doubt deriving it from ποῡ (Doric πω̑) μάλα.
It is not found elsewhere in these Comedies, but it was very common in comic writers, πολύ ἐστιν ἐν τη̩̑ ἀρχαία̨ κωμω̨δία̨, says Harpo­ cration, who adds that Aristophanes employed it again in the Cocalus, the play which came after the Plutus.70.
ἐκτραχηλισθη̩̑ πεσών]

For Poseidon and Dio­ nysus were undoubted Gods;

'Twas Zeus that caused it, jealous of mankind.
For, when a little chap, I used to braghe is regarded as a mortal come to be healed by the God;
and it is not until he leaves the Temple with his sight restored that he takes the position of a genuine God.83.
αὐτότατος]
Kuster cites some tro­ chaic tetrameters from the Trinummus (iv. 2) which Plautus must have trans­ lated from a passage very similar to the present-
SY.
Eho I quaeso, an tu is es ?
On.
Is enimvero sum.
Sy. ain' tu tandem, is ipsusne es ?
CH. aio.
Sy. ipsus as ?84. ἐκ Πατροκλέους] From Patrocles's.
Patrocles was some sordid miser of the day.
Socrates, as Spanheim observes, had a half-brother of that name (Plato's Euthydemus, chap. 24);
but he can hardly be the Patrocles to whom the poet is here alluding.99.
οὐδ’ ἐγὼ γὰρ ὁβλέπων]
This is a hit at the audience who were always well-pleased with a joke of this kind against themselves.

This line is usually continued to Chremylus, but the Venetian MS.
seems clearly right in giving it to Cario, who is never back­ ward in asserting his own exceptional merit.
πλὴν is here a conjunction as, frequently elsewhere ;

The universality of Wealth's pronouncement makes it include Cario, who is not at all dis­ posed to put up with this slur on his character.

This paren­ thetical expression is probably borrowed from line 625 of the Medea (to which Kuster refers), where Medea says to Jason, νύμφευ’.

Meal cake.
A cake of ground barley (from ψοίω to grind) mingled with oil and honey.

For only a wealthy man could offer a βοῦς, whilst a ψαιστὸς would be within the means of the poorest.

The greed of the Corinthian courtesans was notorious, and it required a man of great wealth to satisfy their exorbitant demands.
οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἰς Κόρινθόν ἐσθ᾽ o 7rXovs. " Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum.''
This was a saying of universal application, but probably Aristophanes has at this moment in his mind the particular case of the loutish Philonides, who had recently been unmercifully fleeced by the Corinthian Lais.
See infra 179, 303.151.
ἐὰν δὲ πλούσιος]
Arrogant as they are to the poor, yet for money they will submit to any degradation.160.
τέχναι δὲ πα̂σαι]
We shall find, infra 511, the invention of all arts ascribed to Poverty, and in a sense each statement is accurate.
They are the two sides of the shield.
The object of the inventor is to escape PovertyA gift to offer, if thy power deny
The needful silver ?
Single-handed, thou, If Zeus prove troublesome, canst crush his power.
WE.
Men sacrifice to Zeus for ME ?
CH.
They do.
And whatsoever in the world is bright, And fair, and graceful, all is done for thee.
For every mortal thing subserves to Wealth.
CAR.
Hence for a little filthy lucre I'm A slave, forsooth, because I've got no wealth.
CH.
And those Corinthian huzzies, so they say, If he who sues them for their love is poor, Turn up their noses at the man;
but grant A wealthy suitor more than he desires.
CAR.
So too the boy-loves;
just to get some money, And not at all because they love their lovers.
CH.
Those are the baser, not the nobler sort, These never ask for money.
CAR.
No ?
what then ?CH. 0 one a hunter, one a pack of hounds.
CAR.
Ah, they're ashamed, I warrant, of their vice, And seek to crust it over with a name.
CH.
And every art existing in the world, And every craft, was for thy sake invented.and to gain wealth.
Except for the one line, 169, interposed by Wealth, the speech of Chremylus in the MSS.
extends from hence to line 180.
But some of the sentences clearly belong to Cario;
and most editors divide the lines equally between the two, giving sometimes alternate lines, and some­ times alternate half-lines to each in turn.
This, however, does not adjust the sentiment to the speaker;
and it seems better to give to each the lines which seem more appropriate to his character, as I have endeavoured to do.
It might have been thought that the references to Wealth in the second person (διὰ σὲ) would belong to one speaker, and those in the third person (8ta τοῦτον) to the other;
but this arrangement does not work out satis­ factorily.
See the Scholium quoted in the note on 190 infra.166. γναφεύει]
Whether this word should commence with a y or a K has been the subject of great dispute, a dis­ pute so bitter, Lucian tells us, that the two letters, gamma and kappa, nearly came to blows on the question;
ἐς χεῖρας μικροῦ δεῖν ἤρχετο.
Jud. Voc. 4, where see Hemsterhuys's note.
The grammarians say, some that κναφεύει was the older, and γναφεύει the later Attic form;
and some that κνφεύει was the special Attic spelling, and γναφεύει the common or Hellenic spelling.
The latter distinction tells in favour of γναφεύει here, since Aristophanes, as was natural in a writer whose plays, at the Great Dionysia, would be per­ formed not before Athenians only but before strangers from all friendly Hellenic states, preferred the general Hellenic forms to the mere Attic pro­ vincialisms.
Moreover, according to Dawes, the preceding e though it would be long before γν-, would be short before κν- (Misc. Crit. p. 196);
and although his rules are mere counsels of perfec­ tion, and are frequently disregarded by the poets, yet they do sufficiently indi­ cate their general practice.168.
διὰ a-c που παρατίλλεται]
Ata is here universally translated for want of;
a sense in which it appears to be used supra 147, but which is quite contrary to its ordinary meaning, and to the meaning which it bears everywhere else in the present passage.
Even in line 147 it requires to be supplemented by the explanation διὰ τὸ μὴ πλουτεîν ἴσως.
And it seems most probable that it is here employed in its ordinary significa­ tion, and that the adulterer's depilation is due not to his poverty but to his wealth.
For a husband, catching an adulterer with his wife, was by law permitted to put him to death.
The law is set out in Demosthenes Against Aristocrates 59, and is illustrated by the speech of Lysias De caede Era­ tosthenis.
But a wealthy adulterer might possibly, by the payment of a large sum of money, bribe the hus­ band to remit the extreme penalty ofFor thee one sits and cobbles all the day, One works in bronze, another works in wood, One fuses gold-the gold derived from thee-CAR.
One plies the footpad's, one the burglary trade,CH.
One is a fuller, one a sheepskin-washer, One is a tanner, one an onion-seller, Through thee the nabbed adulterer gets off plucked.
WE. 0, and all this I never knew before !
CH.
Aye 'tis on him the Great King plumes himself;
And our Assemblies all are held for him;
Dost thou not man our triremes ?
Answer that.
the law, and to let him off either scot­ free ([Demosthenes] Against Neaera 84), or with some less punishment.
"Dedit hic pro corpore nummos," as Horace says.
And it may well be that in some recent case, well-known to the audience, the husband had accepted a bribe to spare the adulterer's life, and content himself with the minor penalty of depila­ tion.
Οὔτω γὰρ, says the Scholiast on Clouds 1083, τοὺς ἁλόντας μοιχοὺς ᾔκιξον ... παρατίλλοντες αὐτοὺς, θερμὴν τέφραν ἐπέπασσ
ον.
In that case therefore the detected adulterer would, by means of his wealth, have escaped with a plucking.170.
μέγας βασιλεύς]
The Persian monarch was to the Hellenes the personification of riches.
Herodotus is constantly alluding to the vast wealth at his disposal.
And Persian gold was at this time an important factor in the combinations of Hellenic states.171.
ἐκκλησία]
For after the termina­ tion of the Peloponnesian War and the downfall of the Athenian Empire, the people for a time lost all interest in political matters, and ceased to attend the public assemblies.
Nor did the ἐκκλησιαστικὸν, or feefor attending the assembly, suffice, so long as it was but one obol, to overcome their apathy.
But when it was raised to three obols, all this was changed;
there was a general rush to attend, and the meetings again became crowded.
See infra 329 ;
Eccl. 183-8, 300-10, and the notes there;
and the note on Eccl. 102.172.
τὰς τριήρεις]
This would always be true ;
but there is probably a special allusion here to the enormous expense incurred, since the formation of the Anti-Spartan League (B. c. 395), in re­ suscitating the Athenian fleet;
an expense which would fall all the more heavily on the citizens, because the Athenian treasury was no longer filled with the tribute exacted from the subject allies.
Hence no doubt the necessity of raising the sum of 500 talents mentioned in Eccl.
823-9.173. TO ξενικόν]
This is the Foreign Legion, the mercenary force established by Conon at Corinth, B.C. 393, in con­ nexion with the Anti-Spartan League.
It had recently distinguished itself, under the command of Iphicrates, by the sensational destruction of a Spartan mora.
See the Introduction.174.
Πάμφιλος]
Of Pamphilus, and his satellite Aristoxenus, the needle-seller (6 βελονοπώλης), we know only what the Scholiasts tell us.
He seems to have been a worthless demagogue, who embezzled the public money;
and being detected was punished by the confisca­ tion of his property.
In the crime and in the punishment his hanger-on and parasite was involved.
The Scholiast quotes from the Amphiaraus of Plato—
Well may you call
He is a cheat, Pamphilus a scoundrel Also an informer.
(The metre is ἀσυνάρτητος, an iam­ bic dipody followed by a trochaic tripody, if I may give that name to a trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic.
There is no mention elsewhere of an "Amphiaraus" of Plato ;
and probably for Ἀμφιαράῳ we should read ταῖς ἀφ᾽ ίερῶν, a well-known comedy of that poet.
See Meineke's Hist. Crit. p. 167.)
This Pamphilus has nothing to do with the painter mentioned infra 385.176.
Ἀγύρριος]
Of Agyrrhius, a very conspicuous personage at this time, we have already heard in the Ecclesiazusae.
See the notes on lines 102, 176, and 183 of that play.
He was the notorious demagogue, whose introduction of the ἐκκλησιαστικὸν made him the most popular man in Athens.
On the death of Thrasybulus, he had succeeded to his command, and become both wealthy and arrogant.
His insolence is signi­ fied by the word πέρδεται, which means στρηνιᾷ πλουτῶν as the Scholiast says.
Cf. infra 618.177. Φιλέψιος]
Οὖτος πἐνης ἦν· συντιθεὶς οὖν μύθους χαρίεντας οὕτω TTjv τροφὴν αὑτῷ ἐπορίζετο.—Scholiast.
He had pro­ bably not long before the date of this play, made some very profitable hit with his tales.
Does he not feed the foreign troop at Corinth ?
Won't Pamphilus be brought to grief for him ?
CAR.
Won't Pamphilus and the needle-seller too ?
Does not Agyrrhius flout us all for him ?
CH.
Does not Philepsius tell his tales for thee ?
Dost thou not make the Egyptians our allies ?
And Lais love the uncouth Philonides ?178.
ξυμμαχία]
We do not know the precise transaction to which this line refers;
but we know that about this time both the Egyptians and the Athenians were lending some support to Evagoras of Cyprus in his contest with the Persian Empire ;
and no doubt some dealing took place between them in that connexion which accounts for the present observation.
179.
Φιλωνίδου]
Philonides of Melite was a bulky and clumsy blockhead with a voice like the braying of a jackass.
The wits of Athens dubbed him an “ass " and the "son of an ass." Several gibes at his expense are quoted by the Scholiast from the Comic Poets.
Thus Plato in the Laius— And Theopompus in the Aphrodisia- And again, Nicochares in the Galatea—
But he had plenty of money;
and therefore, repulsive as he was in mind and body, Lais the Corinthian courtesan was willing to accept him as her lover, and led him into every sort of excess and debauchery:
see infra 303.
There were several courtesans of that name ;
but doubtless this was the original Lais, the famous beauty who when quite a child was among the captives taken by the Athenians in Sicily B.C. 415;
her native town, Hyccara, being sacked by Nicias, and all its inhabitants sold into slavery.
Accordingtothe Scholiast's calculations, she would not have been more than thirty-four at the date of the Plutus, an age at which she may well have proved irresistible to the boorish Athenian;
and although the Scholiast tells us that Plato in a comedy exhibited three years before the Plutus spoke of her as no longer in existence, yet, he adds very sensibly, it is possible that she was alive when this was said.
And we may be sure that she was so, since, years after this, Epicrates wrote a comedy about her called the "Anti-Lais," and described her as an old woman who had lost all her charms and all her popu­ larity.
Athenaeus (xiii. chap. 62), refer­ ring to a speech of Lysias in which Philonides is said to have been en­ amoured of the courtesan NaM, suggests that we should here read Ναĩς for Aair.
And cf. Harpocration, s. v. Ναίς.
This is of course possible;
but all the MSS.
have Λαὶς, and this very observation of Athenaeus makes it plain that Λαὶς was the reading in his day.
And although his suggestion is worth recording, it would be unwise to adopt it.
180.
ό Τιμοθέου δὲ πύργος]
Timotheus, son of the famous Conon, and in later life himself a most distinguished officer, became on his father's death a year or two before the exhibition of this play the possessor of considerable wealth.
He therefore commenced to build, at Athens, a magnificent mansion adorned with a lofty tower, which was possibly considered what we should call a " Timotheus's Folly."
Cario was going to add Was it not erected by means of thee ?
(οὐκ ἐγένετο διὰ σέ ;
—Scholiast) when Chremylus annoyed at the per­ sistent interruptions of his slave, breaks in with the petulant exclamation May it fall on thy head!
Meineke, with his usual infelicity, would take this exclama­ tion from Chremylus (to whom it is exactly suited) and transfer it to Wealth, to whom it is absolutely unsuited.
Wealth is now listening with rapt attention to the revelations, and gradu­ ally yielding to the arguments, of Chremylus and Cario.185.
ἐπικαθέζηται]
Just as we speak of Victory sitting on a warrior's helm, so here Aristophanes speaks of Wealth sitting on a warrior's helm, and giving him the victory in the battle.
The Scholiast's idea that Wealth is supposed to be sitting in, and weighing down, the scale of battle is contrary both to the Greek and to the meaning;
for the weighing down of the scale was the sign not of victory but of defeat.
Iliad viii. 72, xxii. 212.CAR.
Timotheus' tower- CH.
Pray
Heaven it fall and crush you !
Aye, everything that's done is done for thee.
Thou art alone, thyself alone, the source

WE.

πάντων πλησμονή]
The Scho­ liast refers, and possibly Aristophanes is intending to refer, to Iliad xiii.
636, πάντων μὲν sopor ἐστί, καὶ ὕπνου καὶ φιλότητος, Of all we may have too much, yea even of sleep and of love.
But a penta­ meter of Theognis comes nearer to the poet's meaning;
πλὴν πλούτου, παντὸς χρήματός ἐστι κόρος (596, Bergk).193.
οὐδεὶς μεστὸς κ.τ.λ.]
The trite line Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit was cited nearly 400 years ago by Girard in his note on this line.
" For," says St. Chrysostom (Horn. LXXX in Matth.
772 B), "just as a fire, if you throw in more fuel, blazes up more fiercely;
even so the love of money, if you throw in more gold, grows higher and higher."
And again (Hom. Rom. xii. p. 554
B) speaking of the same subject, he says ̋Ερως γάρ ἐστιν οὗτος ἀτελεστος, καὶ ὅσῳπερ ἂν πλείονα προέλθῃ ὁδὸν, τοσούτω̩ μᾶλλον τοῦ τέλους ἀφέστηκας.
Cf. Id. Hom. Rom. xiii. 573 B. And Solon wrote- lines which, with the change of ἀνδράι κεῖται into ἀνθρώποισιν, are found also among the verses of Theognis (227-9, Bergk).
197.
οὐ βιωτόν TOV βίον]
Life is not liveable:
a common phrase, which we shall meet again, infra 969.
Ismene employs it in Oed. Col. 1693;
it is put into the mouth of Socrates by both Plato (Apol. chap. 28) and Xenophon (Mem. iv. 8. 8);
and it is frequently found in the Orators.
St. Chiysostom uses it in Horn. xii in 1 Cor. (105 E) and ix in 2 Cor. (501 E).
So also Longus, Pastorals iv. 12.210. TOV Λυγκέως]
Lynceus was the keen-eyed Argonaut who ὀξυτάτοις ἐκέκαστο̕̕̕̕̕̕̕῎ Ομμασιν, as Apollonius tells us (i. 153), and could see, it was reported, even into the bowels of the earth.
"And even Lynceus," says Wealth in Lucian's Timon 25, "would be hard put to it to discover a righteous manFor give a man a sum of thirteen talents, And all the more he hungers for sixteen;
Give him sixteen, and he must needs have forty, Or life's not worth his living, so he says.
WE.

CH.
What is that ?
WE.
This mighty power which ye ascribe to me, j I can't imagine how I'm going to wield it.
CH. 0 this it is that all the people say, Wealth is the cowardliest thing.
WE.
It is not true.
That is some burglars slander;
breaking into A wealthy house, he found that everything Was under lock and key, and so got nothing:
Wherefore he called my forethought, cowardliness.
CH.
Well, never mind;

And play the man;
and very soon I'll make you Of keener sight than ever Lynceus was.
WE.
Why how can you, a mortal man, do that ?CH.
Good hope have I from that which Phoebus told me, Shaking the Pythian laurel as he spoke.
WE.
Is Phoebus privy to your plan ?
CH.
He is.upon earth:
and how then can I, who am blind ? " "
But thou,” says Lucinus to his companion in the same author's Hermotimus 20, " canst see even better than Lynceus ;
for thine eyes, it seems, can penetrate into our hearts, and all things are open unto thee;
so that thou canst perceive what each man wishes, and what each man knows.
"213. Πυθικὴν σείσας δάφνην]
For the delivery of an oracular response from Phoebus was accompanied by the violent agitation of the bay-trees sur­ rounding his shrine.
Many allusions to this phenomenon are collected here by Spanheim, Kuster, and others.
Thus in Virgil, Aen. iii. 90 " tremere omnia visa repente Liminaque laurusque Dei," before the voice of Phoebus issued from the shrine.
And Callimachus begins his Hymn to Apollo with the words οἷον o τ᾽Απόλλωνος ἐσείσατο δάφνινος ὄρπηξ, adding just below, o yap θεὸς OVK ἔτι μακράν.
For the trembling of the bay-trees signified the presence of the God.215.
ὁρᾶτε]
Take heed what you are saying, or, perhaps, what you are doing.
Wealth was apparently about to say more, when Chremylus interrupts him.216. κἄν με δέη θανεῖν]
Ihave substituted these words for the κἂν δεῖ (or κεἰ δεῖ) μ᾽ἀποθανεῖν of the MSS.
which few editors have found themselves able to accept.
In sentences of this kind the pronoun almost invariably precedes the verb;
εἴ με χρείη τοὔγκυκλον κ.τ.λ., Lys. 113;
κεἵ μ᾽ὡσπερεὶ ψῆτταν δέοι, Id. 115 ;
κἃν ἀποθανεῖν ἡμα̑ς δέῃ, Id. 123 ;
κἄν με δέῃ δι᾽ ἡμέρας, Frogs 265, and so on.
We should certainly have expected the compound verb rather than θανεῖν, but Aristophanes frequently employs the simple verb in similar circumstances.
Of. Ach. 893, Frogs 1012.219. ἄλφιτα]
The word is introduced παρa προσδοκίαν.
Chremylus was ex­ pected to say Men who have not a grain of fear.
WE.
Take heed !
CH.
Don't fret yourself, ray worthy friend.
I am the man :
I'll work the matter through, Though I should die for it.
CAR.
And so will I.CH.
And many other bold allies will come, I Good virtuous men without a grain of-barley.
WE.

a set of rather poor allies.
CH.
Not when you've made them wealthy men once more.
Hi, Cario, run your fastest, and CAR.
Do what ?CH.
Summon my farm-companions from the fields, (Y ou'll find them there, poor fellows, hard at work)
And fetch them hither;
so that each and all May have, with me, an equal share in Wealth.
CAR.
Here goes !
I'm off.
Come out there, somebody, And carry in my little piece of meat.
CH. I'll see to that:
you, run away directly.
But thou, dear Wealth, the mightiest Power of all, Come underneath my roof.
Here stands the house, Which thou art going evermore to fill With wealth and plenty, by fair means or foul.
WE.
And yet it irks me, I protest it does, To enter in beneath a stranger's roof.
I never got the slightest good from that.221.
ἐξ ἀρχῆς πάλιν]
Again, as of old.
A favourite Aristophanic combination;
infra 866, Peace 997, 1327, Frogs 592.
It is frequent in Plato;
Theaetetus chap.
30(187 A), Laches chap. 27 (197 E), &c. So Eusebius (Of the Martyrs of Palestine ix.
1) says that the fires of persecution, well-nigh quenched in the blood of the martyrs, broke out πάλιν ἐξ ὑπαρχῆς.
227.
κρεάδιον]
The little bit of meat which he was bringing back from the Delphian sacrifice.
See the note at the commencement of this Commentary.233.
Kal δικαίως κἀδίκως]
This is not to be taken au pied de la lettre, as though Chremylus were really wishing to be enriched by dishonest means.
He is slily adopting the ordinary form of prayers for wealth ;
rem, si possis, recte, si non, quocunque modo rem.236.
αἀτοῦ]
From that, viz.
TOO εἰσέρ­ χεσθαι, as the Scholiast says.244.
ἐν ἀκαρεῖ χρόνῳ]
In no time:
literally, in time so short that it cannot be shortened.
More commonly we find it written ἐν ἀκαρεῖ χρόνον, and so Lucian has it in his Timon (3 and 23), a dialogue very reminiscent of this Comedy, and frequently elsewhere.
But as Hemsterhuys observes in his notes on the Timon " ad Atticorum elegantiam magis convenit ἐν ἀκαρεῖ χρόνῳ.”
The latter is the form adopted by St. Chrysostom (Hom. 1 in Matth. 16 C) ἐν ἀκαρεῖ χρόνῳ ἐπὶ τὰς πὺλας αὐτῆς (the heavenly City) μεν.
So ἐν ἀκαρεῖ
ῥοπῃ̑, Id. xxvi. (320 B).249. ἰδεῖν σε βούλομαι]
He wishes to show Wealth to his wife (who presently appears on the stage, full of interest in the proceedings) and to his only son, for whose sake he had undertaken the expedition to Delphi.
The construc­ tion no doubt is " I wish my wife and son to see you,” not " I wish you to see them," though possibly the words may be intended to suggest both alterna­ tives.
We saw in the opening note of the Commentary that the house of Chremylus is in the background of the scene;
and both he and Wealth retire into it after line 252, leavingWas it a misery house;
the miser straight Would dig a hole and pop me underground ;
And if some worthy neighbour came to beg A little silver for his urgent needs, Would vow he'd never seen me in his life.
Or was it some young madcap's :
in a jiffey Squandered and lost amongst his drabs and dice I'm bundled, naked, out of house and home.
CH.
You never chanced upon a moderate man, But now you have j for such a man am I.
For much I joy in saving, no man more, And much in spending when 'tis right to spend.
So go we in;
I long to introduce
My wife and only son whom most I love- After yourself of course.
WE.
That I believe.
CH.
Why should one say what is not true to you ?
CAR.
0 ye who many a day have chewed a root of thyme with master, My labour-loving village-friends, be pleased to step out faster;
Be staunch and strong, and stride along, let nothing now delay you,the stage vacant for the re-entrance of Cario.253.
ὠπολλὰ δή κ.τ.λ.]
Cario who after line 229 had gone out to summon the needy agriculturists, τοὺς ξυγγεώργους, now makes his reappearance on the stage, while the ξυγγέωργοι, who form the Chorus of the play, come bustling down the εἴσοδος into the orchestra.
They and Cario are old friends, and as they follow him (though not by the same route) into the theatre, they bandy about between them a lot of rustic jokes, culminating in the pleasantry of a coarse, but jovial, country-dance.
So it happens that in the last extant Comedy of Aristophanes as in the first (Ach. 241-79) we have a graphic representation of the amuse­ ments of Athenian rustics.
πολλὰ is equivalent, as the Scholiast observes, to πολλάκις;
θύμον is said by some to be the wild onion;
but it seems safer to retain the word thyme.
I cannot agree with Bergler that there is here a play upon the words θυ̍̆μον, thyme, and θν̄μὸς, spirit;
or any allusion in θύμον φαγόντες to the Homeric ν θυμὸν κατέδων.
The whole atmosphere of the passage is against any allusion of the kind.
259.
ἴσως]
Everywhere in Aristophanes this adverb is introduced merely to qualify the directness of an assertion, and should be rendered methinks, for­ sooth, or the like.
So supra 148, infra 1080.
There is no ground for the suggestion of the Scholiast and Com­ mentators that in the present line it means equally with you, that is, as fast as you.
ἀξιοι̑ς means
You claim that I should run, that is you expect me to do so.
266.
ῥυπω̑ντα κ.τ.λ.]
Filthy, bent double, miserable, wrinkled, hairless, toothless.
As this is Carious good news, the Chorus at once jump to the conclusion, not far removed from the truth, that the old man must have brought with him " a heap of money."
With the expres­ sion σωρὸν χρημάτων Brunck compares Plautus Mercator iii.
4. 54-6. And cf. infra 804.
The words ὦχρυσὸν ἀγγείλας ἐπω̑ν are quoted ἐκ τη̑ς κωμω̜δίας by the Emperor Julian (Ep. 12 ad init.)
Your fortunes lie upon the die, come save them quick, I pray you.
CHORUS.
Now don't you see we're bustling, we, as fast as we can go, sir.
We're not so young as once we were, and Age is somewhat slow, sir.
You'd think it fun to see us run, and that before you've told us
The reason why your master seems so anxious to behold us.
CAP,.
Why, I've been telling long ago ;
'tis you for not attending!
He bade me call and fetch you all that you, for ever ending
This chill ungenial life of yours, might lead a life luxurious.
CHOP.
Explain to me how that can be;
i'faith I'm rather curious.
CAR.
He's got a man, an ancient man, of sorriest form and feature, Bald, toothless, squalid, wrinkled, bent, a very loathsome creature.
I really should not be surprised to hear the wretch is circumcised.
CHOP.
0 Messenger of golden news, you thrill my heart with pleasure.
I do believe the man has come with quite a heap of treasure!
CAR.
0 ay, he's got a heap, I guess, a heap of woes and wretchedness.
CHOR.
You think, I see, you think you're free to gull me with impunity.
No, no;
my stick I've got and quick I'll get my opportunity.
CAR.
What think you I'm the sort of man such things as that to do, sirs ?
Am I the man a tale to tell wherein there's nothing true, sirs ?
CHOR.
How absolute the knave has grown !
your shins, my boy, are bawling, A4 ! A4 ! with all their might and main, for gyves and fetters calling.
who was fond of showing off his ac­ quaintance with Aristophanes.275.
is σεμνὸς οὑπίτριπτος]
We have already had ὡς σεμνὸς ό κατάρατος in the same sense in Frogs 178.
In their next sentence the Chorus mean that Cario is so saucy, he must actually crave for punishment, his shins must be crying out for shackles and fetters.
Cf. infra 1099.
κνη̑μαι ... ποθου̑αι, as Fischer says, " sunt crura quae gestiunt in nervos coniici, et compedibus vinciri."
The word Χοίνικες merely means specially strong fetters ;
πέδαι τινές εἰσι, say the Scholiast and Suidas;
al βαθει̑αι πέδαι, says Hesychius;
where Toup is no doubt right in changing βαθει̑αιιnto παχει̑αι, though he does not seem to have been aware of the passages in Demosthenes, de Corona 164 χοίνικας παχείας ἤχων, and Alciphron iii.

A dicast, wish­ ing to exercise his judicial duties, would go in the early morning to the κληρω­ τήρια, and draw a letter, one of the second ten letters (from A onwards) of the Greek alphabet.
Armed with this letter he would present himself at the Court-house to which the same letter was affixed, and take his seat for the day.
See the notes on Eccl. 681, 683.
At the rising of the Court he would receive from the presiding Archon a ξύμβολον, a ticket or certificate of attendance, on presenting which to the κωλακρέτης he would obtain his pay.
Cario, in his teasing mood, says that the letter drawn by the old Chorus- leader is one which would give him the entry not to any Court-house, but to his coffin;
and that he will receive his ticket not from the Archon, but (by an anagram) from Charon.
όΧάρων κατὰ ὰναγραμματισμὸν "Αρχων λέλεται.—Scho­ liast.
This ticket would entitle him, not to the three-obol, but to a passage on Charon's ferry-boat to the world of the dead.

μόθων...κόβαλος...φενακίζεις]
In Knights 634 the Sausage-seller, invoking the powers of Mischief and Buffoonery, exclaims aye δὴ Φένακες καὶ Κόβαλοι καὶ Μόθων.
The idea involved in μόθωνιs that of drunken wantonness;
in κόβα­ λος that of tricksy impishness.
μόθων was the name of a tipsy uproarious dance, Knights 697.
The name of the κόβαλοι is supposed to survive in the Cobolds of the Continent, and our own goblins.
CAR.
You've drawn your lot;
the grave you've got to judge in;
why delay now ?
Old Charon gives the ticket there;
why don't you pass away now ?
CHOR.
Go hang yourself, you peevish elf, you born buffoon and scoffer.
You love to tantalize and tease, nor condescend to offer A word of explanation why we're summoned here so hurriedly.
I had to shirk some urgent work, and here so quickly hasted, That many a tempting root of thyme I passed, and left untasted.
CAR.
I'll hide it not:
'tis Wealth we've got;
the God of wealth we've captured, You'll all be rich and wealthy now.
Ha, don't you look enraptured !
CHOR.
He says we'll all be wealthy now;
upon my word this passes, sirs.
CAR.
0 yes, you'll all be Midases, if only you've the asses' ears.
CHOR.
0 I'm so happy, I'm so glad, I needs must dance for jollity, If what you say is really true, and not your own frivolity.
CAR.
And I before your ranks will go, Threttanelo !

through the midst of them, and emerg­ ing without a root, that is, without a plant.
Coming in from the country, they passed a lot of lovely thyme, which they were in too great a hurry to gather;

Scholiast.
Such are their petty wants and cares who are about to be enriched beyond the dreams of avarice.
287. Μίδαις]
Ye will be Midases, wealthy as the wealthy King of Phrygia.
But Midas had another peculiarity besides the possession of vast wealth:
he had the ears of an aEs.
The Chorus therefore cannot be Midases, unless they also can obtain asses' ears.
Probably as Cario utters the words ἤν ὠτ'ὄνου λάβητε, he touches his own ears with the gesture of derision mentioned in the note to Peace 1258.
Of.
Persius, Sat. i. 59.290.
Kal μὴν K.T.X.]
We now come to the country-dance or game, which presents a vivid picture of the coarse pleasantry of Athenian rustics.
One of the country-folk (here Cario) per­ sonates the Cyclops, capering about with wild and disorderly gestures;
whilst the others (here the Chorus) assume to be the comrades of Odysseus endeavouring with a good deal of horse­ play to catch their old antagonist.
Then the Cyclops changes into Circe, and is still chased by the same crew, whom in the legend she had turned into swine.
Probably in the real game there was a genuine chase, a sort of " hare and hounds" frolic ;
but this would be impossible in the theatre ;
and the Chorus merely demonstrate, bytheir vehement dancing in the or­ chestra, against Cario dancing on the stage.
The game seems to have crossed the Adriatic, and to have found a con­ genial home in Italy.
For it was doubt­ less to a dance of this description that Horace alludes in the passages already cited by many commentators, Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa, Sat. i. 5. 63, and Ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur, ut qui I Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur, Ep. ii.
2. 124. The metre is throughout iambic, tetra­ meter, trimeter, or dimeter.
The word θρεττανλὸ does not enter into the construction of the sentence;
it is merely an imitation of the twanging of the lyre.
The Scholiasts tell us that both this word and the line ἀλλ'εἶα, τέκεα, θαμίν' ἐπαναβοω̑ντες are taken from the Loves of Galatea and the Cyclops" the famous lyrical drama by Philoxenus of Cythera, which is mentioned by Aristotle (Poetics 4), Aelian (V. H. xii. 44), and others.
Philoxenus, being in Sicily, the Scholiasts tell us, fell in love with Galatea, the mistress of Dionysius the Elder.
The intrigue was detected by Dionysius who, by way of punishment, sent the poet to work in the stone-quarries.
Escaping thence, he took his revenge upon Dionysius by publishing this pastoral drama, in which the Cyclops was made a vehicle for caricaturing Dionysius;
and Galatea and he were represented as a sort of "Beauty and the Beast."
In later times the love of the Cyclops for Galatea was treated as part of the original legend without any reference to Diony­ sius ;
and formed the subject of an Idyll of Theocritus, a dialogue of Lucian, and a tale in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, besides innumerable references elsewhere.
And perhaps few who read these versions of the old Cyclops legendAnd I, the Cyclops, heel and toe, will dance the sailors hornpipe,— so !
Come up, come up, my little ones all, come raise your multitudinous squall, Come bleating loudly the tuneful notes Of sheep and of rankly-odorous goats.
Come follow along on your loves intent;
come goats, 'tis time to your meal ye went.
CHOP.
And you we'll seek wherever you go, Threttanelo !
Threttanelo !
And you, the Cyclops, will we find in dirty, drunken sleep reclined, Your well-stuffed wallet beside you too, with many a potherb bathed in dew.
And then from out of the fire we'll take A sharply-pointed and burning stake, And whirling it round till our shoulders ache, its flame in your hissing eyeball slake.
CAR.
And now I'll change to Circe's part, who mixed her drugs with baleful art;
Who late in Corinth, as I've learned, Philonides's comrades turnedremember that Galatea was a real woman, the mistress of Dionysius, and only by way of satire brought into con­ nexion with the mythical Polyphemus.291.
παρενσαλεύων]
The participle is intransitive and signifies swayiny, rock­ ing from side to side, and so dancing.
The passage may be rendered, And ven7y I, acting the Cyclops, tralalala, and capering with both my feet, like this, will go before and lead you on.
But hey!
my little ones, keeping up an incessant clamour, and bleating forth the cries of sheep and malodorous goats, follow after me;
and you, ye he-goats, shall have your breakfast.
He speaks to his companions as if they were the flocks ὄϊές τε καὶ αἶγες (Od. ix. 184) which he, the Cyclops, herded.
θαμωὰ is equivalent to θαμὰ incessantly.
The Scholiast took ἀκρατιει̑σθεto be connected with ἀκρᾰτὴς, and explained it by ἀκρατη̑πράσσετε;
but the second syllable is long, and it therefore, as Brunck pointed out, must come from ἀκρᾱτίζεσθαι, to breakfast, " matutinum cibum sumere.
"296.
ἡμει̑ς δέ γ'αὖ]
But the Chorus are not sheep and goats ;
they are the comrades of Odysseus who in the ninth Odyssey burnt out with a fiery stake the single eye of the Cyclops, and they are quite ready and willing to repeat the performance now.302.
τὴν Κίρκην]
Enough of the Cyclops and the ninth Odyssey:
he will now be Circe who in the tenth Odyssey turned his pursuers, the comrades of Odysseus, into swine.
He will imitate her in all her ways, πάντας τρόπους.303.
Φιλωνίδου]
See supra 179.
It was Philonides, and not his comrades, whom Lais, the modern Circe, metamorphosedinto a beast;
but Cario speaks of τοὺς έταίρ
ους του̑ Φιλωνίδου, because it was not Odysseus but his comrades whom the Circe he is representing turned into swine;
and perhaps there is also a reminiscence of that familiar Attic idiom whereby οἱ ἀμΦί Φιλωνίδη is merely a periphrasis for Philonides himself.308.
ἕπεσθε μητρὶ χοι̑ρ
οι]
This little refrain has no immediate connexion with the context.
If it is not taken from the pastoral drama of Philoxenus, we may conjecture that it was a sort of catch-word, so to say, in these rustic merry-makings, an exhortation perhaps to the village yokels to "follow their leader" in some game or dance.313. μινθώσομεν]
We will rub your nose, as if it were a goat's, in dung.
Apparently some filthy trick of this kind had been played upon some disre­ putable young fellow named Aristyllus;
see Ecclesiazusae 644-8, and the notes there.
Though the Chorus address Cario as Circe, they do not forget that they are really addressing a man, and adapt their language to his sex.317. ἐπ'ἄλλ' εἶδος]
He has beenTo loathsome swine in a loathsome sty, And fed them all on kneaded dung which, kneading, she amongst them flung.
And turn you all into swine will I.
And then ye'll grunt in your bestial glee Wee !
wee !
wee !
Follow your mother, pigs, quoth she.
CHOR.
We'll catch you, Circe dear, we will;
who mix your drugs with baleful skill;
Who with enchantments strange and vile ensnare our comrades and defile ;
We'll hang you up as you erst were hung
By bold Odysseus, lady fair;
and then as if a goat you were We'll rub your nose in the kneaded dung.
Like Aristyllus you'll gape with glee Wee !
wee!

Follow your mother, pigs, quoth he.
CAR.
But now, old mates, break off, break off;
no longer may we jest and scoff;
No longer play the fool to-day.
And ye must sail on another tack, Whilst I, behind my masters back, Rummage for meat and bread to eat, And then, whilst yet the food I chew, I'll join the work we are going to do.
CH.
To bid you " welcome," fellow-burghers, nowspeaking of them as metamorphosed, by means of his Circe-enchantments, into swine;
but now they are to take another shape, and become, I suppose, their natural selves.322. χαίρειν μέν]
Cario goes into the house to get his bread and meat, and Chremylus comes out to welcome the visitors.
The salutation χαίρειν, he says, is ἀρχαι̑ον, by which he means old­ fashioned;
but Lucian in his little apology "Pro lapsu in salutando " when he observes τὸ μὲν δὴ χαίρεινἀρχαία μὲν ή πρ
οσαγόρευσθς, though he doubtless has his eye on the present passage, yet means by ἀρχαία merely the ancient or original form of salutation.
Lucian shows by examples from Homer and others that it was formerly used on any occasion, and not, as in Lucian's own time, merely as a morning salutation ;
ἴδιος δὲ καιρὸς οὐδεὶς ἀπενενέμητο
Tjj προσ­ ρήσει, οὐδὲ ὡς νυ̑ν μόνος ὁ ἑωθινός.
But Plato, he says, objects to the form ὡς μοχθηρὸν ὂν καὶ οὐδὲν σπουδαι̑ον ἐμφαι̑νον, and prefers εὖ πράττειν, ὡς KOLVOV σώμα­ τός τεκαὶ ψυχη̑ς εὐ διακειμένων σύμβολον.
See Plato's Third Epistle.
Euripides, however, seems to have been of a differ­ ent opinion, since he makes Aegeus say325.
συντεταμέως]
From the whole tenour of this little speech, and especi­ ally from these long and affected ad­ verbs, we may safely conclude that the poet is parodyingsome unknown author..
The Chorus reply'in the same style;
they will look downright Ares";
a phrase reminiscent, as Bergler remarks, of the λεύντων"Αρην δεδορκότων of Aeschy­ lus, Sept. 53.

so I—" clasp " you all.
Ye who have come in this stout-hearted way, This strenuous way, this unrelaxing way, Stand by me now, and prove yourselves to-day In very truth the Saviours of the God.
CHOR.
Fear not:
I'll bear me like the God of War.
What, shall we push and hustle in the Assembly I To gain our three poor obols, and to-day Let Wealth himself be wrested from our grasp ?
CH.
And here, I see, comes Blepsidemus too.
Look !

He has heard a rumour of whales happening here.
BLEPSIDEMUS.
What can it mean ?
Old Chremylus grown wealthy!
Then whence and how ?
I don't believe that story.
And yet by Heracles 'twas bruited wide Amongst the loungers in the barbers' shops That Chremylus had all at once grown rich.
And if he has, 'tis passing wonderful That he should callhis neighbours in to share.
That's not our country's fashion, anyhow.
CH. I'll tell him everything.

He is alluding to the ἐκκλησιαστικὸν, or payment for attending the assembly.
Originally introduced by Agyrrhius as a dole of one obol, it was afterwards increased by the same demagogue to three obols.
See the note on 171 supra, and Eccl. 300 seqq.335.
τί ἂν οὐ τὸ τρα̑λμ']
To Chremylus, alone on the stage, enters Blepsidemus an old crony of the same age and stand­ ing.
He is talking to himself, as he enters, of the wonderful news he has heard.338. κουρείοισι]
In these barbers' shops the old Athenians were accustomed to sit, while they retailed and discussed the gossip of the day.
See the note on Birds 1441.345.
εί yap τω̑ν φίλων]
You are in the number of my friends;
and, according to the well-known proverb, κοινὰ τὰ τω̑ν φίλων.
No proverb was more frequently on the lips of the ancient Greeks than this, which is said to have been origin­ ally a precept of Pythagoras.
It is found in Euripides (Orestes 735), Plato (Phaedrus ad fin., Laws 739 C), Aristotle (Ethics viii.
9. 1), and many other authors.
We are told by Photius s. v., and the Scholiast on the Phaedrus, that it was introduced by Menander into his comedy of "the Brothers";
and it is.
still found, in a Latin form, in Terence's version of that play:
" vetus verbum hoc quidem est Communia esse amicorum inter se omnia," Adelphi v. 3. 18.
And cf. Lysistrata 238, 239.
It is found in almost all the ancient collections of Greek proverbs;
see Gaisford's Paroe­ miographi, pp. 68, 146, 199, 329.

It occurs with equal frequency in the same orator's brief speech on a similar subject against Euthynous.
And cf. Pollux vi. 154.
The three forms of theft here enumer­ ated, κλοπὴ furtum simple larceny, ἁρπαλὴ latrocinium, robbery with violence, and ἀποστέρησις depositum negare, embezzle­ ment, are known to all systems of juris­ prudence, though all sometimes com­ prised under the generic name furtum.
ἀποστέρησιςdiffers from the other two in the circumstance that the money was not obtained, but merely withheld, by fraud.
In the days of the Roman Caesars the misappropriation of a de­ posit seems to have been an everyday form of dishonesty.

Just as, in the Acharnians, Lamachus, quarrelling with Dicaeopolis, affects to see in the polished mirror of his shield an old man, (his opponent) on his trial for cowardice (Ach. 1129);
so here Blepsidemus pre­ tends to see in the near future a culprit (Chremylus) pleading for mercy before a hostile tribunal.
He is seated in the raised box set apart for the Defendant, and with him are his weep­ ing wife and children brought in to move the pity of the Court;
see Wasps 568, 976, and the notes there.
These hapless suppliants would be in the Defendant's bema, and therefore in Wasps 977 they are directed to go up, α̉ναβαίνιν.
He is, and probably they all are, supposed to be holding out the olive-branch enwreathed with wool which was the symbol of supplication ;
ι̒ĸετηρία ' ĸλάδος ἐλαίας ἐρίῳ πεπλεγμένος.— Scholiast.
The piteous little group which the imagination of Blepsidemus has conjured up remind him of nothing so much as the Heracleidae in a paint­ ing by Pamphilus.
These would doubt­ less be Iolaus with Alcmena and her grandchildren (the children of her dead son Heracles) supplicating the King of Athens to protect them from the emis­ saries of Eurystheus.
The scene would probably be that represented in the Heracleidae of Euripides, though the artist had collected into one group characters which in the Tragedy do not appear together.
Pamphilus was the famous artist, the master of perspective and composition, the teacher of Apelles.
He excelled in battle-pieces, and otherWith olive-branch in hand, and at his side

Blepsidemus, hardly able to believe his ears (the phrase, I find, has already been em­ ployed by Van Leeuwen), is afraid that Chremylus, even when he swears by Poseidon, is playing him some trick;
and therefore wishes to know whether he is really swearing by the great Sea-God, the brother of Zeus, who in Birds 1614 swears by himself.407.

This refers to something about which we have no information.
It may well be that in the reduced circumstances in which Athens found herself after the termination of the Peloponnesian War, and especially when so vast an outlay on her fleets and forti­ fications had been rendered necessary by her adhesion to the Anti-Spartan League (see the note on 172 supra) she was unable to continue the large salaries paid to her public doctors ;
who might consequently be wiled away, as Demo­ cedes had been 150 years before (Hdt. iii. 131) by more generous offers from wealthier states.
See Bentley's xixth Dissertation on Phalaris;
Boeckh's Public Economy, i. 21;
Mahaffy's Social Life in Greece, chap. x.
In the Acharnians and Wasps we heard of the famous physician Pittalus;

At this moment, indeed, Aegina was in the hands of the enemies of Athens, but I do not know that this would make any difference in a Comic Play;
and of course it was otherwise in 408 B. c. when the first Plutus was acted.
And the statement (infra 653-6) that as soon as the little party arrived at the Temple, they bathed Wealth in the sea seems rather to point to Aegina, for the Athenian Temple was close to the acropolis, between the Theatre and the Propylaea, quite out of the way of the sea, Pausanias, Attica xxi.
7. There was, indeed, a Temple of Asclepius in the Peiraeus, but it does not seem to have been of any note as a health-resort.
However, Aristophanes leaves the loca­ lity undefined.413. ̉ε̉ν γέ τι]

'Ερινύς]
Some think that the reference is to the Eumenides of Aes­ chylus, but even if the Erinyes there bore torches, which they do not seem to have done, it is very improbable that Aristophanes is referring to so old a play.
There were doubtless other, and more recent, Tragedies in which an Erinys appeared with a torch in her hand ;
as Tisiphone does in the passage of Lucian to which Dobree has already referred.

Very different to the appearance of Poverty in this play is the picture drawn by the Christian preacher, έμαὶ γἀρ, says St. Chrysostom, ἡ Πενι̒α ĸόρη̣ τινιĸοσμι̒ῳ ĸαὶ ĸαλη̑ ĸαι̒ εύειδει̉ πρασεοικέναι δαĸει̑.-Hom. 90 in Matth. 843 D. Scholiast.
But it seems rather in the nature of a general malediction, as infra 612.427.
λεĸιθάρωλιν]
An omelette-seller.
That women sat in the market selling eggs and omelettes we have already seen in Lys. 562.
λέĸιθος is the yolk of an egg, TO ξ̒ανθὰντου̑ ῳ̕ου̑, o ĸράĸοςτου̑ ῳ̕ου̑, as the Scholiasts say.430.
ἐĸβαλει̑ν]
What is the meaning of this ?
There has not been a syllable in the play to justify the charge.
No one has thought of expelling Poverty from Hellas.
Wealth was merely to desert the wicked who are numerous,Or God or man !
Now therefore ye must die.
CH.
But who are you that look so pale and wan ?
BL.
Belike some Fury from a Tragic Play.
She has a wild and tragic sort of look.
CH. No, for she bears no torch.
BL.
The worse for her.
Pov.
What do you take me for ?
CH.
Some pot-house girl
Or omelette-seller:
else you would not bawl
At us so loudly ere you're harmed at all.
Pov.
Not harmed !
Why is it not a shameful thing
That you should seek to drive me from the land ?
CH.
At all events you've got the Deadman's Pit.
But tell us quickly who and what you are.
Pov.
One who is going to pay you out to-day Because ye seek to banish me from hence.
CH.
Is it the barmaid from the neighbouring tapand transfer himself to the righteous who are few.
Rari quippe boni;
όλίγον τὸχρηστὸν ένθάδε.
Far from banishing Poverty, one would suppose that this would largely augment the number of her adherents.
Yet the men do not.
deny the charge she brings.
It is admitted;
and becomes the basis of the ensuing discussion.
The fact is that Aristophanes is quietly introducing­ so quietly that it seems to have escaped the notice of every Scholiast and Com­ mentator—an entirely new idea;
an idea which dominates the controversy between Poverty and the two friends, and then disappears as suddenly as it came, only making its reappearance in the concluding scene of the play.
He is looking forward to the second stage of the Revolution he is engineer­ ing.
When all good men are rich, and all bad men are poor, the bad will begin to see the advantages of virtue, and finding that " honesty is the best policy " will themselves become good and, as a consequence, wealthy.
Thus at length all will be rich (infra 1178), and none will be poor;
and Poverty will be banished out of the land.
SSe will disappear, because wickedness will disappear, and Wealth will make πάντας χρηστοὺς ĸοὶ πλουτυ̑ντας δη̒που τά re θει̑α
σέβοντβς, infra 497, a line which furnishes the key to the enigma.
On the βάραθρ
ον which was to be the only refuge left her, see the note on Frogs 574.
It was a large pit or chasm at Athens into which the corpses of criminals were thrown.436.
ĸοτύλαιςμε διαλυαἰνεται]
Wrongs me in my half-pints, by giving me short measure.
The same offence is described somewhat differently in Thesm.
348 τω̑ν ĸοτυλω̑ν τὸ νόμισμα
8Lαλυμαίνεται.
At this insult the stranger discloses her name nepta μὲν ου̉ν, immo vero Paupertas;
like the Φρυνώνδας μὲν ου̉ν, immo vero Phrynondas of Thesm.
861.440. η̉ĸιστα πάντων]
That is the very last thing of all that I'll do.449, ποίοις ο̉πλισιν]
What armour have we wherewith to fight against her?
All our arms, offensive and defensive, she herself makes us pawn.453.
τρόπων]
The advent of Wealth will at once discomfit Poverty and all her ways, τρόπων:
not a very apt word but introduced for the sake of the pun with τροπαῑ
ον.
He will take her τρόπ
ους as spoils, and with them erect a trophy over his vanquished antagonist.
Bergler compares Plautus's pun Ut vobis victi Poem poenas sufferant.
Cistellaria, last line of Act i.Who always cheats me with her swindling pint-pots ?
Pov.
It's POVERTY, your mate for many a year IBL 0 King Apollo and ye Gods, I'm off.
CH. Hi!
What are you at ?
Stop, stop, you coward you, Stop, can't you ?
BL.
Anything but that.
CH. Pray stop.
What!
shall one woman scare away two men ?
BL.
But this is Poverty herself, you rogue, The most destructive pest in all the world.
CH. Stay, I implore you, stay.
BL.
Not I, by Zeus.CH.
Why this, I tell you, were the cowardliest deed
That ere was heard of, did we leave the God Deserted here, and flee away ourselves Too scared to strike one blow in his defence.
BL. 0, on what arms, what force, can we rely ?
Is there a shield, a corslet, anywhere
Which this vile creature has not put in pawn ?
CH.
Courage !
the God will, single-handed, rear A trophy o'er this atrophied assailant.
Pov. What!
dare you mutter, you two outcasts you, Caught in the act, doing such dreadful deeds.
CH. 0, you accursed jade, why come you herewere common terms of abuse, scum of the earth;
being properly the designa­ tion of the two human victims, doubt­ less the vilest of the vile, who were sacrificed at Athens every year, at the festival of the Thargelia, as scapegoats for the purification of the city.
Aristo­ phanes reproaches the people for appointing to every office persons whom in former times the city would hardly have stooped to use as φαρμαĸοι̒̕, Frogs 733;
and Eupolis, in the lines quoted in the note to that passage, declares that they chose the scum of the earth, ĸαθάρματα, for their generals.
In Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead (ii. 1) the wealthy and luxurious dead, Croesus, Midas, and Sardanapalus, complain that the Cynic goes round reviling them as άνδράποδα.
and ĸαθάρματα :
and in the Jupiter Tragoedus (52) Timocles, ex­ hausting his whole vocabulary of vituperation against an opponent, addresses him as τυμβωρύχε ĸαἰ μιαρε, ĸαὶ ĸατάπτυστε, Kal μαστιία, ĸαὶĸάθαρμα, &c. See also Plutarch's Sylla, chap. 33.468. ĸα̉ν μὲν άποφἠνω]
This is another instance of the σχη̑μα άνανταπόδ
οτον, one instance of which we have already noticed in Thesm.
536, and of which numerous examples are collected by Kuster and Bergler here.
I will only add to their list one from Xenophon's Memorabilia iii. 1. (9) where Socrates is talking to a youth who has been taught the duties of a general, and, amongst other things, the expediency of placing the best troops in the van and in the rear, and the worst troops in the middle ;
whereupon Socrates says ει̕ μἐν ĸαὶ διαγινώσĸειν σε τοὺς άγρθοὺς καὶ τοὺς ĸαĸοὐς έδίδαξυν εί δὲ μὴ, τί σοι ο̉φελος ω̉ν ε̉μαθες;
The second clause seems invariably to commence with ει̒ μὴ, even where the first commences as here with η̉ν.476.
τύμπανα ĸαἰ ĸύφωνες]
At this last audacious pronouncement of Poverty, Blepsidemus interrupts with a loud cry for help;
invoking those instruments of torture to which he would like to consign his antagonist.
τύμπανα are cudgels (Latin, fustes) with which criminals were beaten;
sometimes toAbusing us ?
We never did you wrong.
Pov.
No wrong, forsooth !
0 by the heavenly Powers No wrong to me, your trying to restore Wealthy sight again ?
CH.
How can it injure you, If we are trying to confer a blessing On all mankind ?
Pov. Blessing !
what blessing ?
On.
What ?
Expelling YOU from Hellas, first of all.
Pov.
Expelling ME from Hellas !
Could you do A greater injury to mankind than that ?
CH.
A greater ?
Yes ;
by NOT expelling you.
Pov.
Now that's a question I am quite prepared To argue out at once;
and if I prove
That I'm the source of every good to men, And that by me ye live- :
but if I fail, Then do thereafter whatsoever ye list.
CH.
You dare to offer this, you vixen you ?
Pov.
And you, accept it:
easily enough Methinks I'll show you altogether wrong Making the good men rich, as you propose.
BL. 0 clubs and pillories !
To the rescue!
Help !death, as Spanheim observes, referring to (amongst other passages) Lucian's Cataplus 6, where Clotho describes the dead criminals as τοὺ έĸ τυμπάνου ĸαὶ τοὐς ἀνεσĸολοπισμέους. The Scholiast here explains them to be ξ̒ύα, οι̉ς τύπτοντοι έν τοι̑ς δεσμωτηρίοις οί τιμωρού­ μενοι.
The ĸύφων was a sort of pillory.
The culprit had to remain in a standing position, with his neck bent (whence the name) and his head inserted through, and imprisoned in, the wooden machine.
Spanheim refers to a fragment of Cratinus, preserved by Pollux, x. 177 έν τῳ̑ κύφωνιΤΟΡ αὐχέν' ε̉χων, and to Athen­ aeus viii.
44, where we are told that Stratonicus, observing έν τῳ̑ ĸύφωνι δεδεμένους δύω, remarked ω̒ς μιĸροπολι­ τιĸὸντὸ μὴδύνασθαισυμπληρω̑σαι.
Of this remark Casaubon offers several ex­ planations, all of which seem to me very improbable ;
and I should rather infer from it that a ĸύφων could accom­ modate a number of criminals, and that a city which left all but two holes unoccupied must be but a petty un­ aspiring place.
And cf. Lucian's Necyo­ mantia 14.480. ίμημ’ έπιράψ]
Shall I enter as the penalty.
See Birds 1052 and the note there.
Chremylus is to open the case against Poverty ;
and it was there­ fore his duty, as accuser, to state in the indictment the punishment to be inflict­ ed on the prisoner, if found guilty.
Familiar instances of this will be found in the Wasps of Aristophanes and the Apology of Plato.485.
ούĸ α̉νφθάνοιτε]
You can't be too quick, a very common phrase in Euri­ pides.
It occurs again in this Comedy infra 874, 1133.
rOSTO πράττοντ” is taken by the Scholiast and Commentators to mean άποθανόντε, but I doubt if it means anything more than beginning the argu­ ment.487. άλλ' η̉δη K.T.X.]
We now come to one of those set discussions in the long anapaestic tetrameters, which are always such favourites with Aristo­ phanes.
The phrase used by the Chorus in exhorting their Champion, μαλαĸὸν ένδιδόνι ούδὲν, not to admit or give way to any feeling of weakness, is found inPov.
Don't shout and storm before you have heard the facts.
BL.
Who can help shouting, when he hears such wild Extravagant notions ?
Pov.
Any man of sense.
CH.
And what's the penalty you'll bear, in case
You lose the day?
Pov.
Whatever you please.
CH. 'Tis well.
Pov.
But, if ye are worsted, ye must bear the same.
BL. (To Ch.)
Think you that twenty deaths are fine enough ?
CH.
Enough for her;
but two will do for us.
Pov.
Well then be quick about it;
for, indeed,
How can my statements be with truth gainsaid ?
CHOR.
Find something, I pray, philosophic to say, whereby you may vanquish and rout her.
No thought of retreat;
but her arguments meet with arguments stronger and stouter.
CH.
All people with me, Itam sure, will agree, for to all men alike it is clear, That the honest and true should enjoy, as their due, a successful and happy career, Whilst the lot of the Godless and wicked should fall in exactly the opposite sphere.
'Twas to compass this end that myself and my friend have been thinking as hard as we can, And have hit on a nice beneficial device, a truly magnificent plan.
For if Wealth should attain to his eyesight again, nor amongst us so aimlessly roam, To the dwellings I know of the good he would go, nor ever depart from their home.
The unjust and profane with disgust and disdain he is certain thereafter to shun, Till all shall be honest and wealthy at last, to virtue and opulence won.
Hdt. iii. 51 and 105;
and in Eur. Helen 508.497.
χρηστοὺς ĸαὶ πλουτου̑ντας]
We have seen in the note on 430 supra that this is the one illuminating line which makes clear the position of the parties to this discussion, and explains why the rehabilitation of Wealth will result in the extinction of Poverty.
It therefore in no way deserves the reception with which it meets at the hands of Dr. Blaydes.
" Miror," he says, " neminem interpretum in hoc versu haesisse;
est enim foede corruptus.
Corrigo sic, πauras χρηστοὐςπλουτει̑νο̉νταςδήπου τἀ τε θει̑α σέβοντας.”
But Dr. Blaydes's alteration, which he inserts in his text, would (1) make the line a mere repeti­ tion of 495, and (2) require the article, τοὐς χρηστοὐς, and τοὐς τἀ θει̑α
σέβοντας:
and finally it would make nonsense of Poverty's reply which is directed against the proposition, not that the good are to be enriched, but that all are to be rich, and none to be poor, so that Poverty will cease to exist.503.
αύτά]
Χρήματα, the word being involved in πλουτου̑σι, which, as the Scholiast observes, is equivalent to χρήματα ε̉χουσιΤhere is an exactly similar usage in Frogs 1466.505.
ου̉ĸουν ... πορι̒σειεν]
If then Wealth shall make an end of her, I aver that there is no way whereby he could provide greater blessings for mankind.
Poverty has declared that to get rid of herself would be a positive injury to men.
Chremylus replies, here as before, that nothing that they could do would be a greater blessing.
Some transfer these two lines to Blepsidemus.
—Scholiast.
But it is really the Scho­ liast himself who ου̉ĸοι̉δεν τήν του
̑Is there any design more effective than mine a blessing on men to confer ?
BL.
No, nothing, that's flat;
I will answer for that;
so don't be inquiring of her.
CH.
For our life of to-day were a man to survey and consider its chances aright, He might fancy, I ween, it were madness or e’en the sport of some mischievous sprite.
So often the best of the world is possessed by the most undeserving of men, Who have gotten their pile of money by vile injustice;
so often again
The righteous are seen to be famished and lean, yea, with thee as their comrade to dwell.
Now if Wealth were to-night to recover his sight, and her from amongst us expel, Can you tell me, I pray, a more excellent way of bestowing a boon on mankind ?
Pov. 0 men on the least provocation prepared to be crazy and out of your mind, Men bearded and old, yet companions enrolled in the Order of zanies and fools, O what is the gain that the world would obtain were it governed by you and your rules ?
Why if Wealth should allot himself equally out (assume that his sight ye restore), Then none would to science his talents devote or practice a craft any more.
j
Yet if science and art from the world should depart, pray whom would ye get for the future
To build you a ship, or your leather to snip, or to make you a wheel or a suture ?
Do ye think that a man will be likely to tan, or a smithy or laundry to keep, Or to break up the soil with his ploughshare, and toil the fruits of Demeter to reap, If regardless of these he can dwell at his ease, a life without labour enjoying ?
CH.
Absurd !
why the troubles and tasks you describe we of course shall our servants employ in.
Pov.
Your servants !
But how will ye get any now ?
I pray you the secret to tell.
CH. With the silver we've got we can purchase a lot.
Pov.
But who is the man that will sell ?
CH.
Some merchant from Thessaly coming, belike, where most of the kidnappers dwell.
515.
καρπὸν Δηου̑ς]
The entire line has an Epic or Tragic flavour, and the use of Δηὼ for Δημήτηρ implies if not a quotation or a parody, at all events an imitation of some more dignified style.519. πρω̑τον]
On the use of πρω̑τον to introduce a preliminary objection to an opponent's argument see Eccl. 657 and the note there.
See also three lines below.521.
ἐκ θετταλίας]
The Thessalians were notorious slave-dealers ;
and the great slave-port was said to be Pagasae, near the modern Volo at the head of the gulf of that name;

—Athen­ aeus i. 49.526. ὲς κεφαλὴν σοί]
May your ill­ omened words fall on your own head, recoil on yourself.
See Ach. 833, Clouds 40, Peace 1063, infra 650, 651.529. μυρίσαι]
Both the bridegroom and the bride were perfumed with fragrant odours;
see Peace 862 and the note there, and Lys. 938 ;
but here both verbs, μυρίσαι and (in the following line) κοσμη̑σαι, refer to the adornments of the bride.
Ye will not be able, when ye marry a bride, to perfume her with liquid perfumes, or to adorn her with the expense of garments dyed into a thousand variegated hues.535.
φῴδων ἐκ βαλανείου]
Burns and blisters from the bath-room stove.
TheWho still, for the sake of the gain he will make, with the slaves that we want will pro­ vide us.
Pov.
But first let me say, if we walk in the way wherein ye are seeking to guide us, There'll be never a kidnapper left in the world.
No merchant of course (can ye doubt it?)
His life would expose to such perils as those had he plenty of money without it.
No, no;
I'm afraid you must handle the spade and follow the plough-tail in person, Your life will have double the toil and the trouble it used to.
CH.
Thyself be thy curse on !
Pov.
No more on a bed will you pillow your head, for there won't be a bed in the land, Nor carpets;
for whom will you find at the loom, when he's plenty of money in hand ?
Rich perfumes no more will ye sprinkle and pour as home ye are bringing the bride, Or apparel the fair in habiliments rare so cunningly fashioned and dyed.
Yet of little avail is your wealth if it fail such enjoyments as these to procure you.
Ye fools, it is I who alone a supply of the goods which ye covet ensure you.
I sit like a Mistress, by Poverty's lash constraining the needy mechanic;
When I raise it, to earn his living he'll turn, and work in a terrible panic.
CH.
Why what have you got to bestow but a lot of bums from the bathing-room station
And a hollow-cheeked rabble of destitute hags, and brats on the verge of starvation ?
And the lice, if you please, and the gnats and the fleas whom I can't even count for their numbers, Who around you all night will buzz and will bite, and arouse you betimes from your slumbers.
Up ! up !
they will shrill, 'tis to hunger, but still up ! up ! to your pain and privation.
For a robe but a rag, for a bed but a bag of rushes which harbour a nationpoor in the cold weather would crowd round the stove in the public baths, and so would get blisters and burns.
Cf. infra. 952, 953. In Alciphron (i. 23) a cold and shivering pauper, with the frost penetrating to his bones and marrow, strives to get to the bath-room stove, but fails by reason of the crowd surrounding it, καὶ γὰρ αὒτοὺς, he says, ἡ παραπλησία θεὸς ἠνόχλει, Tieνία.
See also Id. iii. 42. φωἵς is a scald, a blister caused by the fire.

πιθάκνης]
Μικρ
ου̑ πίθου.—Scholiast, who observes that it is a diminutive from πίθος, as ποκίχνη from πόλις.
There is not the slightest justification for thrusting upon Aristophanes, as a few recent editors have done, the vulgar provincia­ lism φιδάκνη, which was never employed by any reputable Attic writer.
It is not countenanced by a single MS.
either here or in Knights 792, nor does any grammarian attribute its use to our poet.548.
ὑπεκρούσω]
Descanted upon.
One Scholiast says ἐφθέγξω, ἐπὸ μεταφορα̑ς τω̑ν κρουόντων τὴν κιθάραν.
And another αἰνιγματωδω̑ς ὑπηχήσας.
The one was a Tyrant, the other the deliverer of his country from Tyrants.
Yet in his last years Thrasybulus was denounced by hireling orators as if he were himself a Tyrant, like Dionysius of Syracuse.
Some specimens of theOf bugs whose envenomed and tireless attacks would the soundest of sleepers awaken.

So great and exceeding
Are the blessings which Poverty brings in her train on the children of men to bestow !
Pov.
The life you define with such skill is not mine:
'tis the life of a beggar, I trow.
CH.
Well, Poverty, Beggary, truly the twain to be sisters we always declare.
Pov.
Aye YOU !
who to good Thrasybulus forsooth Dionysius the Tyrant compare !
But the life I allot to my people is not, nor shall be, so full of distresses.
'Tis a beggar alone who has nought of his own, nor even an obol possesses.
My poor man, 'tis true, has to scrape and to screw and his work he must never be slack in;
There'll be no superfluity found in his cot j but then there will nothing be lacking.
CH. Damater !
a life of the Blessed you give :
for ever to toil and to slave At Poverty's call, and to leave after all not even enough for a grave.
Pov.
You are all for your jeers and your Comedy-sneers, and you can't be in earnest a minute, Nor observe that alike in their bodily frame and the spirit residing within it, My people are better than Wealth’s;
for by him, men bloated and gross are presented,language they employed about him are given in the note to Eccl.
203. An allusion to two of the most glorious incidents in his career, the capture of Phyle and the proclamation of the Amnesty will be found infra 1146.
You then, says Poverty, doubtless turn­ ing to the audience, you who regard your great patriot Thrasybulus as on a level with the tyrant Dionysius, you and such as you may also confuse two things so radically different as Poverty and Pauperism.
Fritzsche must have been unaware of the abuse lavished upon Thrasybulus only a short time before the date of the present Comedy when he suggested (Quaest. Aristoph. p. 236) that Thrasybulus may have had a brother Dionysus, and that the allusion here is not to Dionysius the Tyrant, but to that supposed brother.
See the note on Eccl. 357.556. μηδὲ ταφη̑ναι]
The same expression is employed in the preceding play, Eccl. 592.
There it is said that the poor man will leave behind him not even enough land for his own grave;
here that he will not leave enough money to dis­ charge his own funeral expenses.
Cf. Ach. 691.566. νὴ τὸν Ala κ.τ.λ.]
The reading in the text is that of several excellent MSS., and I see no sufficient reason for rejecting the line.
In the earliest printed edition, and for nearly three centuries afterwards, it was presented in such an unmetrical and hopelessly muddled form that we cannot wonder at Bentley considering it " stolidissimi cuiusdam homuncionis emblema, quod, unde malum pedem intulit, eo est ablegandum."
And even to the line as it now stands Person (Adv. p. 34) raises two objections;
(1) the occurrence of the particle ye immediately after at'a, as to which see Birds 11, Thesm.
225, and the remarks in the Appendices to those plays;
(2) " Non frigidus modo et ineptus est locus, sed contra morem et decorum, ut Chremyli rationes con­ futare aggrediatur Blepsidemus."
But Blepsidemus is not really endeavouring to refute, he is rather seeking to give point to, the argument of Chremylus.
Poverty had said that the poor were κόσμιοι, whereupon Chremylus, pervert­ ing her words to the case of thieves, retorts "0 yes, its very κόσμιον to steal";
and Blepsidemus, keeping to the idea that such was Poverty's meaning, adds "
Yes for a thief (κκέπτης understood from Chremylus's κλέπτειν) is so modest that he keeps out of sight."
Chremylus had not said that it was not κόσμιον toFat rogues with big bellies and dropsical legs, whose toes by the gout are tormented;
But mine are the lean and the wasplike and keen, who strike at their foemen and sting them.
CH.
Ah, yes;
to a wasplike condition, no doubt, by the pinch of starvation you bring them.
Pov.
I can show you besides that Decorum abides with those whom I visit;
that mine Are the modest and orderly folk, and that Wealthy are with insolence flushed and with wine.
"
CH.
'Tis an orderly job, then, to thieve and to rob and to break into houses by night.
BL. Such modesty too !
In whatever they do they are careful to keep out of sight.
Pov.
Behold in the cities the Orator tribe;
when poor in their early career
How faithful and just to the popular trust, how true to the State they appear.
When wealth at the City's expense they have gained, they are worsened at once by the pelf, Intriguing the popular cause to defeat, attacking the People itself.
CH.
That is perfectly true though 'tis spoken by you, you spiteful malevolent witch !
But still you shall squall for contending that all had better be poor than be rich.
So don't be elate;
for a terrible fate shall your steps overtake before long.
Pov.
Why, I haven't yet heard the ghost of a word to prove my contention is wrong.
You splutter and try to flutter and fly;
but of argument never a letter.
CH. Pray why do all people abhor you and shun ?
Pov. Because I'm for making them better.
So children, we see, from their parents will flee who would teach them the way they should go.steal, but (ironically) that it was;
and Blepsidemus carries on the jest.
They are both ironical at Poverty's expense.
The idea expressed by Blepsidemus is found in St. Chrysostom's Tenth Homily on 1 Thess. (500 F).
The πλεονέκτης, he says, is worse than a thief.
For the latter καὶ τῷ κρύπτεσθαι καὶ τῷ ἐν νυκτὶ ἐπιχειρει̑ν πολὺ του̑ πολμήματος ύποτέμνεται, ώσανεὶ αἰσχυνόμενος Kal δεδοικὼς τὸ ἁμαρ­ τάνειν.572.
ταύτη γε κομήσῃς]
Don't plume yourself on this, that is, on having spoken the truth about the orators ;
for you will none the less come to grief;
εἰ καὶ ἀληθεύεις μὴ μέγα φρονήσῃς· οὐδὲν yop ἢττον TO αὐτὰ πείσει.—Scholiast.580.
ταύτην... ἀποπέμπει]
These words which in all the MSS.
and earlier editions are continued to Chremylus were transferred to Blepsidemus by Bentley, whose alteration is adopted by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
I certainly do not think that the mere transition from the second to the third person (φήσεις, ταύτην) would justify the alteration, for such a transition is by no means uncommon, and is sufficiently explained here by the Scholiast, TO μὲν “φήσεις " λέγεται πρὸς τὴν Πενίαν, TO δὲ “παύτην δ’ ἡμι̑ν ἀποπέμπει” πρὸς τὸν Βλεψίδημον.
Nevertheless
I have adopted Bentley's arrangement, because the emphatic ἄμφω in the succeeding line seems to imply that both the old men have expressed their concurrence in the sentiment which Poverty is there setting herself to combat.581. λήμαις]
Λήμη is "a sort of ulcer or tumour filling the eyes with an offensive rheum ” (see the note on Eccl. 404) and consequently making them dull-sighted.
By Κρονικαι̑ς we are to understand antiquated, and so dull­ witted.584. δι’ ἔτους πέμπτου]
The Olym­ pian games were celebrated every fourth year, but the Greeks were accustomed, in computations of this sort, to include as well the year from which the calculation started, as that with which it concluded ;
and therefore they called it every fifth year.
SeeSo hardly we learn what is right to discern ;
so few what is best for them know.
CH. Then Zeus, I suppose, is mistaken, nor knows what most for his comfort and bliss is, Since money and pelf he acquires for himself.
BL.
And her to the earth he dismisses.
POV.
0 dullards and blind!
full of styes is your mind;
there are tumours Titanic within it.
Zeus wealthy !
Not he :
he's as poor as can be:
and this I can prove in a minute.
If Zeus be so wealthy, how came it of yore that out of his riches abounding
He could find but a wreath of wild olive for those who should win at the games he was founding, By all the Hellenes in each fourth year on Olympiads plains to be holden ?
If Zeus were as wealthy and rich as you say, the wreath should at least have been golden.
On.
It is plain, I should think, 'tis from love of the chink that the conduct you mention arises ;
The God is unwilling to lavish a doit of the money he loves upon prizes.
The rubbish may go to the victors below;
the gold he retains in his coffers.
Pov.
How dare you produce such a libel on Zeus, you couple of ignorant scorers ?
'Twere better, I'm sure, to be honest and poor, than rich and so stingy and screwing.
CH.
Zeus crown you, I pray, with the wild olive spray, and send you away to your ruin !
Pov.
To think that you dare to persist and declare that Poverty does not present you With all that is noblest and best in your lives !
CH. Will Hecate's judgement content you ?
the Introduction to the Thesmophoria­ zusae, p. xxxv.
It seemed better in the translation to adopt the English mode of calculation than to use words which might convey to the English reader a totally erroneous idea.586.
κοτενῷ στεφάνῳ]
That the prize at the Olympian games was a wreath of wild olive is of course well known. "
And what are the prizes they get for all this ?” asks Anacharsis (in Lucian's dialogue bearing his name, 9) after surveying with dismay the hardships of the Athenian gymnasium.
’Ολυμπίασι μὲν στέφανpς ἐκ κοτίνου, replies Solon, ’Ισθμοι̑ δὲ ἐκ πίτυος, ἐν Νεμέᾳ δὲ σελίνων πεπλεγμένος, Πυθοι̑ δὲ μη̑λα τω̑ν ἱερω̑ν του̑ θεου̑. But " the rewards in the heaven­ ly kingdom," says St. Chrysostom, Horn.
I in Matth.
12 B, " are not crowns of laurel or wild olive (κότινος), but the Life which knows no ending ' and ' to be for ever with the Lord’589.
λήροις]
Trumpery;
things of no value;
referring to the wreath of wild olive.
It is impossible that there can be here, as some have suggested (Scho­ liast, Eustathius at Iliad i. 404), any play on the words λήροις and λειρίς, lilies, analogous to that in Birds 299 on κηρύλος and κειρύλος.594.
παρὰ τη̑ς ‛Εκάτης]
On the thirtieth day of every month (ται̑ςτριακάσι, Athen­ aeus vii. chap. 126) those who could afford it were accustomed to send a meal (called ‛Εκάτης δει̑πνον) to the little shrines of Hecate at the cross-roads, ἐν ται̑ς τριόδοις.
These were intended as offerings to the Goddess, but in reality they were soon snapped up by needy wayfarers.
In Lucian's First Dialogue of the Dead, Diogenes, the cynic below, sends up a message to Menippus, the cynic on earth, bidding him come down there if he wants to enjoy a hearty laugh.
And he tells him to fill his wallet, πήρα, with lupines, καὶ εἴ που εὕροι ἐν τῇ τριόδῳ Εκάτης δει̑πνον κεί­ μενον, and such like trifles.
Accordingly when, in the Twenty-second Dialogue, Menippus disembarks from Charon's ferry-boat, and vows that he has not an obol in the world wherewith to pay his fare (see the note on Frogs 270), Charon after much argument says Let us see what you have got in your πήρα there.
And Menippus replies θέρμους, εἰ θέλεις (lupines, an't please you) Kat τη̑ς ‛Εκάτης To δει̑πνον.598.
ἀλλὰ φθείρου]
Go and be hanged;
abi in malam rem.
So infra 610, Ach. 460.
The word is equivalent to the ἔρρ ἐς κορακας six lines below.
The two Athenians, finding themselves getting the worst of the argument, abruptly stop the discussion, and drive Poverty off the stage by main force.
The little system of twelve lines during which the operation is going on consists of six anapaestic dimeters alternating with six anapaestic dipodies.
600.
οὐ γὰρ πείσεις]
For you shall not convince me even if you do convince me.
No argument shall make me believeIf you question her which are the better, the rich or the poor, she will say, I opine, Each month do the wealthy a supper provide, to be used in my service divine, But the poor lie in wait for a snatch at the plate, or e’er it is placed on my shrinc.
So away, nor retort with a g-r-r, you degraded Importunate scold!
Persuade me you may, but I won't be persuaded.
Pov. 0 Argos, behold !
CH. Nay Pauson, your messmate, to aid you invite.
Pov. 0 woe upon woe !
On.
Be off to the ravens;
get out of my sight.
Pov. 0 where shall I go ?
CH.
Go ?
Go to the pillory;
don't be so slack, Nor longer delay.
Pov.
Ah me, but ye'll speedily send for me back,
Who scout me to-day !
that Poverty is better than Wealth.
You may convince me by argument but " a man convinced against his will
Is of the same opinion still.
"601. ὦ πόλις ’ʹΑργους]
This exclama­ tion is borrowed from the Telephus of Euripides, a Tragedy with which Aristo­ phanes was always delighted to amuse himself.
He had already borrowed these three words in Knights 813, and there he had added to them three more words, taken from Medea 168 κλύεθ’ ola λέγει.
And some early transcriber, remember­ ing this double-barrelled quotation in the Knights, thought fit to repeat it here, and read in this line also ὖ πόλις ’ʹΑργους κλύεθ’ οἶα λέγει, so destroying the metre.
For it is plain that we require here only the anapaestic dipody ὦ πόλις ’ʹΑργος. I have therefore struck out the words κλύεθ’ οἷα λέγει which appear in all the MSS.
and editions.
Aristophanes is quoting from the Tele­ phus of Euripides, not from his own Knights.602.
Παύσωνα]
This "all-roundrascal" Παύσων ό παμπόνηρ
ος must have been quite a youth when Aristophanes, thirty- seven years before, thus described him in the Acharnians;
and still young when, twenty-two years before, hewasdescribed in the Thesmophoriazusac as keeping a stricter fast from poverty, than the Athenian women kept from religious motives on their great Fast-day, the Νηστεία.
He was an animal-painter of no merit;
and also a painter of scurrilous caricatures.
His vice preceded, and very possibly occasioned, his poverty.612.
κλάειν τὴν κεφαλήν]
It is not easy to determine the precise meaning of this formula.
The Scholiasts, though very doubtful, think that we should perhaps supply τύπτουαν, you shall wail, beating your head.
For women, they say, beat their heads when they weep.
But it seems rather to convey a threat;
you shall weep for your head which is going to be soundly smacked.
Thus in Lys. 448 the woman says to the Scythian archer ἐκκοκκιω̑ aου τὰς στενοκωκύτ
ους τρίχας, I will yerk out your squealing hairs, whilst in line 1222 of the same play the Porter threatens the crowd by saying κωκύσεσθε τὰς τρίχας, you shall squeal for your hairs.
Had the observa­ tions been addressed to the same persons, they would have stood to each other in the relation of cause and effect.
See also Wasps 584, Lys. 520.616. ἐκ βαλανείου]
So St. Chrysostom, contrasting the lot, in this life, of the rich and the poor man, says to the Hom. XI. in 1 Cor. (94 C).
CH.
When we send for you, come;
not before.
So farewell !
With Wealth as my comrade 'tis better to dwell.
Get you gone, and bemoan your misfortunes alone.
BL.
I too have a mind for an opulent life
Of revel and mirth with my children and wife, Untroubled by Poverty's panics.
And then as I'm passing, all shiny and bright, From my bath to my supper, what joy and delight
My fingers to snap in disdain at the sight
Of herself and her frowsy mechanics.
CH.
That cursed witch, thank Heaven, has gone and left us.
But you and I will take the God at once To spend the night inside Asclepius' Temple.
BL.
And don't delay one instant, lest there come Some other hindrance to the work in hand.
CH. Hi! boy there, Cario, fetch me out the blankets, And bring the God himself, with due observance, And whatsoever is prepared within.
(They both leave the stage, and a whole night is supposed to pass.
It is now tho next day, and Cario suddenly runs in with joyful news.
He addresses the Chorus in the orchestra.
CAR.
Here's joy, here's happiness, old friends, for youbefore the next line commences a whole night must be supposed to have elapsed.
Had the Comedy been fortunate enough to possess a Parabasis, it would have come in here.627.
ὦ πλει̑στα κ.τ.λ.]
Cario runs in, to declare the great doings of the night.
He is alone on the stage, and greets with accents of joy the Chorus in the orchestra.
This second address commences in much the same style as the first, supra 253, though in somewhat grander language;
and πλει̑στα means very often here, just as πολλὰ meant often there.
At the feasts of Theseus, in token of the unity which he intro­ duced into the Athenian commonwealth, the poorer classes were entertained at a meal, apparently not of a very sumptuous character, provided at the public cost.
The meal se ms to have consisted of porridge and barley-bread ;
and the guests hollowed out bits of the bread as scoops wherewith to eat the porridge.
A scoop so made was called μυστίλη, and μεμυστιλημένοι means ye who have scooped up your porridge;
in ὀλιγίστοις ἀλφίτοις, on tiniest rations of barley-meal.
These workhouse meals, as we may almost deem them, were formerly reckoned luxurious by these poor old men, but now what a change is impending in their ideas and pro­ spects !631.
τω̑ν σαυτου̑ φίλων]
The expres­ sion οἱ σαυτου̑ φίλοι had obviously been employed by some author of the day to denote the fellow-slaves of the person addressed.
In ridicule of this affected phrase, the Chorus are here made to call Cario " best of thy fellow-slaves " (a phrase like "fairest of her daughters Eve”) ;
whilst infra 1134 Hermes, the servant of Olympus, speaking to the same Cario, describes himself as his fellow-slave, τὸν σαυτου̑ φίλον.
The Scholiasts are not quite agreed as to the meaning of the expression, but the explanation τω̑ν ὁμομαστιγιω̑ν which some of them give, is undoubtedly correct.635, 636.
ἐξωμμάτωται. . . τυχών]
These two lines are borrowed from the Phineus of Sophocles, and doubtless refer, in the Tragedy, to one of the sons of Phineus.
They were blinded by their father or (as Sophocles says, Antigone 973) by their stepmother, his second wife.
For this cruelty, Phineus, him­ self blinded, was condemned to the misery of the Harpy-assaults, and Asclepius restored sight to the sons.
See the Scholiast on Find.
Pyth. iii. 96.
This seems the clear meaning of the lines of Sophocles, and we need not trouble ourselves with the cobwebs which learned men have woven about them, on the supposition that they are intended to apply to Phineus himself.
Who, at the feast of Theseus, many a time Have ladled up small sops of barley-broth !
Here's joy for you and all good folk besides.
CHop..
How now, you best of all your fellow-knaves ?
You seem to come a messenger of good.
CAR.
With happiest fortune has my master sped, Or rather Wealth himself;
no longer blind, He hath relumed the brightness of his eyes, So kind a Healer hath Asclepius proved.
CHOR. (Singing.)
Joy for the news you bring.
Joy !
Joy !
with shouts I sing.
CAR.
Aye, will you, nill you, it is joy indeed.
CHOP. (Singing.)
Sing we with all our might, Asclepius first and best, To men a glorious light, Sire in his offspring blest.
WIFE.
What means this shouting ?
Has good news arrived ?
For I've been sitting till I'm tired within639.
ἀναβοάσομαι ... Ἀσκληπιόν]
In this acclaim, as in the preceding, we have the diction of Tragedy, εὔπαιδα λεγει τὸν Ἀσκληπιὸν, says the Scholiast, ὡς καλλίστος ἔχοντα παι̑δας, Μαχάονα, Ποδαλείριον, Ίασὼ, Πανάκειαν, καὶ ‘Υγίειαν.
But probably the allusion goes beyond the actual children, and embraces all the race of the Asclepiads, of whom the most prominent representative at this moment was the celebrated Hippocrates of Cos, τω̑ν Ἀσκληπιαδω̑ν o aptaTos, as the Emperor Julian calls him in his 59th letter.
The expression μέγα βρο­ τοι̑σ ι φέγγος is quite in the style of the usual poetical eulogies of Asclepius.
Bentley refers to Lucian's Alexander 18, where the impostor of that name, passing himself off as a reincarnation of Asclepius, proclaims Εὶμὶ Γλύκων, τρίτον αἷμα Διὸς, φάος ἀνθρώποισιν.
So in the Oracle recording his birth he is addressed as cJ μέγα χάρμα βροτοι̑ς βλαστὼν, Ἀσκληπιὲ, πα̑σιν, Pausanias ii. 26. 6.641. τίς ἡ βοή]
The joyful exclama­ tions of the Chorus have reached the ears of the wife within the house ;
and she runs out, all excitement, to hear the news.
Cario rather plays with her impatience, and she in line 648 replies in the ordinary tone of tragic exhorta­ tion.650.
ἐς τὴν κεφαλήν σοι]
Cario merely means that he will tell the whole story from the beginning to the end, " from top to toe";
but his mistress catches him up on the words ἐς κεφαλήν σοι, which form a common imprecation, most frequently, as in 526 supra, employed in retorts.653, 654.
θεὸν ... ἄνδρα]
Throughout this scene in the Temple, as was observed in the note on 79 supra, As­ clepius is the God, and Wealth the Man.656.
ἐπὶ θάλατταν]
This bath in the sea signified the purification of the patient before he presumed to submit himself to the healing operations of the God.
θάλασσα κλύζει πάντα τἀν­ θρώπων kala' Iph. Taur. 1193. See Dyer's Gods of Greece, chap. vi.
In the Temple itself the patients drank hot water (Xen. Mem. iii. 13 (3)), possibly containing drugs calculated to ensure sleep and dreams.
The Wife's shiver at the notion of a cold sea'bath would be natural at the season, the winter or early spring, at which the performance was taking place in the Athenian theatre.
Waiting for him, and longing for good news.
CAR.
Bring wine, bring wine, my mistress;
quaff yourself
The flowing bowl;
(you like it passing well.)
I bring you here all blessings in a lump.
WIFE.
Where ?
CAR.
That you'll learn from what I am going to say.
WIFE.
Be pleased to tell me with what speed you can.
CAR.
Listen.
I'll tell you all this striking business
Up from the foot on to the very head.
WIFE.
Not on my head, I pray you.
CAR.
Not the blessings
We have all got ?
WIFE.
Not all that striking business.
CAR.
Soon as we reached the Temple of the God Bringing the man, most miserable then, But who so happy, who so prosperous now ?
Without delay we took him to the sea
And bathed him there.
WIFE.
0 what a happy man,
The poor old fellow bathed in the cold sea!
CAR.
Then to the precincts of the God we went.
There on the altar honey-cakes and bakemeats
Were offered, food for the Hephaestian flame.
which at Epidaurus was nearly a mile in circumference, and contained various temples and statues, a theatre, a stadium, and other edifices.
Leake's Morea, ii. 423.
Conspicuous among them was the great columnar στοὰ, within which the patients slept, and which adjoined the ἄβατον or νεὼς, the special sanctuary of Asclepius himself.
660. πόπανα]
These were small plain wheaten cakes, round and flat, much employed in sacrifices:
see the note on Thesm.
285. προθύματα are, strictly, preliminary offerings, cakes, incense, and the like, consumed on the altar before the actual sacrifice of the victim, TO πρὸ τη̑ς θυσίας γινομενα θυμιάματα ἢ πλακούντια, as the Scholiast says.
On the present occasion there would be no victim sacrificed, but Bluster is doubt­ less right in observing that the name would cling to these minor oblations even though, as in the offerings of the poor, no sacrifice of a victim was in contemplation.
The words πέλανος ‘Ηφαίστου φλογὶ, a hodge-podge for the flame of Hephaestus, seemingly borrowed from some Tragic Play, are in apposi­ tion to πόπονα &c. καθωσιώθη, were sanctified, that is, were offered.662.
κατεκλίναμεν]
So in Wasps 123 νύκτωρ κατέκλινεν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἀσκληπιου̑.
There would, no doubt, be regular couches on which the patients would lie, whilst the attendants would hastily improvise for their own use temporary pallets of straw, rushes, or any other material on which they could lay their hands.
The cure was effected while the patient was asleep.
παρεκαττύετο, began stitching up.665. Nεoκλεἰδης]
Neocleides was a prominent orator at the date of the Ecclesiazusae.
See lines 254, 255 and 398-407 of that play, and the notes there.
Here, as there, the Scholiasts describe him as an orator, a sycophant, and a thief.
In each passage of the Ecclesiazusae he is introduced as Νεο­ κλείδης ὁ γλάμων, blear-eyed, purblind, with λη̑μαι in his eyes.
Here he is actually blind, τυφλός.
There too a remedy is prescribed for his eyes, of much the same character as that which Asclepius applies to them here.
673.
ἀθάρης]
Ἀθάρη was a sort of furmety, made of grains of wheat, boiled and fused together, ἔστι δ
ὲThere laid we Wealth as custom bids;
and we Each for himself stitched up a pallet near.
WIFE.
Were there no others waiting to be healed ?
CAR.
Neocleides was, for one;
the purblind man, Who in his thefts out-shoots the keenest-eyed.
And many others, sick with every form Of ailment.
Soon the Temple servitor Put out the lights, and bade us fall asleep, Nor stir, nor speak, whatever noise we heard.
So down we lay in orderly repose.
And I could catch no slumber, not one wink, Struck by a nice tureen of broth which stood A little distance from an old wife's head, Whereto I marvellously longed to creep.
Then, glancing upwards, I behold the priest Whipping the cheese-cakes and the figs from off
The holy table;
thence he coasted round To every altar, spying what was left.
And everything he found he consecrated Into a sort of sack;
so I, concluding677. φθoις]
The φθοι̑ς was a sort of πλακου̑ς made of cheese, honey, and the finest wheat flour.
The exact recipe for its preparation is given by Athenaeus xiv. 57.
Cheese after being ground and pressed was to be passed through a metal sifter.
Being thus reduced into fine strips or threads, it was to be beaten up with honey and half a pint of the finest wheat flour.
o δὲ φθοι̑ς οὔτω γίνεται· τνρὸν ἐκπιέσας τρίβε, καὶ ἐμβαλὼν ἐς κόσ κινον χάλκεον διήθει· εἶτ’ ἐπίβαλλε μέλι Kat σιλίγνεως (siliginis) ἡμίναν, καὶ συμμάλαξον εἰς ἕν.
It was then moulded into a flat circular cake with a little knob in the centre ;
ἔστι δὲ πέμμα πλατὺ, ἔχον ὀμφαλόν.—Moeris.
It was, as Sallier (in his note on Moeris) observes, a rich and delicate compound, differing widely from the π όπανov which was a plain wheaten cake.681. ἥγιζεν]
Ἁγίζειν is used in the sense in which we more commonly find the compound καθγίζειν, viz. to consecrate, to devote a thing by making it an offering to the Gods;
see Birds 566.
Here the priest " consecrates " it, not to Asclepius, but into his own wallet.
There is a somewhat similar jest on καθαγίζειν in Lys. 238.
It is strange that Reiske should have sought to destroy this neat little touch of humour by substituting for ἥγιζεν the prosaic ἥλιζεν;
and stranger still that Blaydes should have actually introduced the latter word into the text of Aristo­ phanes.682.
πολλὴν ὁσίαν]
That it was a thing one had full liberty to do.684.
ἐδεδοίκεις τὸν θεόν]
In the question τὸν θεὸν is the ordinary accusative after ἐδεδοίκεις :
in the answer it becomes the Independent Accusative, representing the nominative to φθάσειέ με.
For a very similar instance of this changed construction see Frogs 41.
Here again contrary to the evidence of all the MSS.
and grammarians, and contrary to the general usage of Aristophanes, some critics insist upon intruding into the text an Attic provincialism, ἐδεδοίκης.687.
προὐδιδάξατο]
Nam sacerdos eius mihi documento fuerat.
—Bergler.
And this translation is adopted by Brunck.
But it seems to me more probable that the priest would really tell the patient, when he brought his offering, that the God would come for it during the night.689.
τὴν χεἲρ’ ὑφη̑κε]
Put forth her hand secretly.
This is the meaning required;
but neither this nor any other adequate sense can be obtained from the MS.
ὑφῄρε1, which can only mean laid hold of the hand.
Many
This was the right and proper thing to do, Arose at once to tackle that tureen.
WIFE.
Unhappy man !
Did you not fear the God ?CAR.
Indeed I did, lest he should cut in first, Garlands and all, and capture my tureen.
For so the priest forewarned me he might do.
Then the old lady when my steps she heard Reached out a stealthy hand;
I gave a hiss, And mouthed it gently like a sacred snake.
Back flies her hand;
she draws her coverlets
More tightly round her, and, beneath them, lies
In deadly terror like a frightened cat.
Then of the broth I gobbled down a lot Till I could eat no more, and then I stopped.
WIFE.
Did not the God approach you ?
CAR.
Not till later.
And then I did a thing will make you laugh.
corrections have been suggested, but all unsatisfactory.
I have therefore substituted ὑφη̑κε, which does not differ widely from the reading of the MSS.
and gives the required sense.
The Scholiasts say τὴν χει̑ρα ἐκτείνει κατὰ τη̑ς χύτρας, ἵνα μηδεὶς αὐτὴν λάβῃ, and again λαθραίως ἐξέτεινε, which are very good explanations of ὑφη̑κε, but do not go at all with ὑφῄρει.690. παρείας] " The παρείας or (as Apollodorus would write it) παρούας is of a yellow colour, with a pleasant eye and a wide mouth, gentle, not danger­ ous of bite;
whence those who investi­ gated these things before me considered it sacred to the most gracious of the Gods, and called it the minister of Asclepius.”
—Aelian, N. A. viii. 12. These harmless yellow snakes are still found in Epidaurus, the head-quarters of the worship of Asclepius.
Their name seems to have been derived from their colour, just as the name παρω̑ας was given, Photius tells us, to ἵπποι μεταξὺ τεφρου̑ καὶ πυρρου̑ χρώparas.
It was merely the accidental similarity of 7rapeίας to παρειὰ, a cheek, that made some grammarians fancy that it derived its name διὰ το τὰς παρειὰς μεγάλας ἔχειν.694. ἔφλων]
Gobbled down.
φλα̑ν, TO μετὰ ψόφου ἐσθίειν.—Scholiast ;
cf. Peace 1306.
In strictness it means to pound, to crush, as infra 718, 784. Clouds 1376.697. μετὰ του̑το δ’ ἤδη]
I have placed a stop after ἤδη so as to make these words refer to the approach of the deity.
In all the editions there is a full stop after οὐδέπω and another after ἐποίηϭα, and no stop at all between those two words;
so that the note of time λετὰ του̑το 8' ἤδη applies merely to what follows, as in Wasps 1021, and an essential step in the transaction is omitted.
701.
'Ιαϭώ] Iaso and Panacea were daughters of Asclepius, the third being Hygieia.
See the note on 639 supra.
Their names connect them with the Art of Healing, so that they would be in their proper places by the bedsides of the sick:
whereas 'Υγίεια, robust Health, might seem somewhat out of place in a hospital.
704.
οὐ μὰ Δί']
Not he.
Here again I have slightly altered the punctuation, by placing a comma after At, as in Frogs 493 where see the note.
After ov μὰ
At we must understand, as the Scholiast observes, οὐδὲν τοιου̑τον ἐποίηϭε, he did none of these things\ neither blushed, nor held his nose, nor even appeared to notice it.
For as he neared me, by some dire mishap
My wind exploded like a thunder-clap.
WIFE.
I guess the God was awfully disgusted.
CAR.
No, but Iaso blushed a rosy red And Panacea turned away her bead Holding her nose:
my wind's not frankincense.
WIFE.
But be himself ?
CAR.
Observed it not, nor cared.
WIFE.
0 why you're making out the God a clown !
CAR.
No, no ;
an ordure-taster.
WIFE.
Oh!
you wretch.
CAR.
So then, alarmed, I muffled up my head, Whilst he went round, with calm and quiet tread, To every patient, scanning each disease.
Then by his side a servant placed a stone Pestle and mortar;
and a medicine chest.
WIFE.
A stone one ?
CAR.
Hang it, not the medicine cbest.
WIFE.
How saw you this, you villain, when your head, You said just now, was muffled ?
CAP..
Through my cloke.
Full many a peep-hole has that cloke, I trow.
Well, first he set himself to mix a plaster716.
φάρμακον καταπλαϭτόν]
A plaster.
In Eccl. 404-6 we have a plaster pre­ scribed for the eyes of this very Neocleides, which it is interesting to compare with the present.
There we have three ingredients, garlic, verjuice (ὀπὸς,fig-tree juice), and spurge ;
and the reader will find in the notes to that passage that all those ingredients were, and indeed still are, deemed of use in the treatment of tumours.
Here too we have garlic and verjuice;
but for spurge Asclepius substitutes squill and vinegar.
There are to be three cloves of Tenian garlic.
Tenos is the central island of the three,-Andros, Tenos, Myconos,—which look as if they had formerly been a prolongation of the Island of Euboea.
It is described both by the old grammarians and by geo­ graphical writers as having been famous for its garlic ;
but I do not know whether this is to any extent an in­ ference from the passage before us.
See the following note.720.
σχι̑νον]’'Ηγουν σκίλλαν.-Scholiast.
This is the plant known as the squill or sea-onion, scilla maritima, which is " very nauseous, intensely bitter, and acrimonious.
If much handled, it exulcerates the skin.
This is one of the few medicines known in the early ages of Greece which is held in good estimation and is in frequent use at this time."
Miller and Martyn's Dic­ tionary.
Dioscorides (ii. 202) says ϭκίλλα δύναμιν ἔχει δριμει̑ν καὶ πυρωτικν.
Galen in his treatise De Plenitudine, chap. viii, ranks it amongst the χυμοὶ μετρίως δάκνοντες.
And at the close of his Pro puero epileptico consilium he observes that they who dress it with vinegar ἰϭχυρὸν ϭφοδρω̑ς ἐργάζοναι τὸ φάρμακον.
Accordingly, to make the mixture more stinging, Asclepius soaks it (διέενος from διĩημι) in Sphettian vinegar.
Sphettus was a town in Attica, probably on the road from Athens to Sunium (Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. xxvi), though Leake, on grounds which seem inadequate, would place it in a more northerly position.
The grammarians are uncertain whether a particularly pungent vinegar was really produced at Sphettus or whether Aristophanes invented the epithet as a tribute to the sour and acrimonious character of the Sphettian townsfolk.
See Athenaeus ii. 76.
If the latter is the true explanation, it is possible that some topical allusion is also lurking in the epithet Τηνίων.721.
τὰ βλέφαρ' ἐκϭτρέψας]
This oint­ ment should have been applied on (i.e. outside) the eyelid;
see Eccl. 406, and the note on Eccl. 404.
But Ascle­ pius, for the purpose not of healing the patient, but of giving him greater pain (ἵνα ὀδυνῷ μα̑λλον), turns the eyelid inside out, and plasters the inside with this stinging stuff.725. ἳν' ὑπομνμενον]
Neither the lan­ guage nor the sense is by any means certain.
The MSS.
have ἐπομνύενον which, with τὰς ἐκκληϭίας (the reading of the best MSS.), could hardly mean anything but " swearing by the Assem­ blies";
as if Neocleides were accustomed to say μὰ τὰς ἐκκληϭίας, νὴ τὰς ἐκκληϭίας,For Neocleides, throwing in three cloves Of Tenian garlic ;
and with these he mingled Verjuice and squills ;
and brayed them up together.
Then drenched the mass with Sphettian vinegar, And turning up the eyelids of the man Plastered their inner sides, to make the smart More painful.
Up he springs with yells and roars
In act to flee;
then laughed the God, and said, Nay, sit thou there, beplastered;
I'll restrain thee, Thou reckless swearer,from the Assembly now.
WIFE.0 what a clever, patriotic God !a very unlikely habit, and one which would not be hindered by his being made more blind.
The Scholiasts give various explanations, and some of them seem to imply the participle ὑπομνύμενον, which was accordingly adopted by Gi­ rard nearly 400 years ago, and is received by all recent editors.
But the passages which they cite from Harpocration and other authorities refer mostly to the well-known ὑπωμοία of the law-courts (an application on oath for the adjourn­ ment of an action on the score of absence, ill-health, or some other ade­ quate cause), and have nothing to do with proceedings in the ἐκκληϭία.
How­ ever, according to Pollux vii. 56, where the mover of a resolution or law was challenged on the ground that his action was prejudicial to the state, this challenge was calledὑπωμοϭία, and the operation of the resolution or law was suspended until this question was decided.
In Xenophon's narrative of the proceedings against the generals after the battle of Arginusae, we are told that a resolution in the interest of the generals was moved by Eurypto­ lemus, and was declared by the Prytanes to be carried;
ὑπομοϭαμένον δὲ Μενε­ κλέους, it was again put to the vote, and on this second occasion was de­ clared to be lost;
Hellenics i. 7. 38.
Here the ὑπωμοϭία was a challenge on oath to the ruling of the Prytanes.
It is obvious that an abuse of this practice of challenging might lead to great obstruction ;
and it is of course possible that Neocleides had recently made himself notorious by dilatory pleas of this kind.
Brunck explains the line " ut meâ opera desinas quaevis promul­ gata plebiscite, interposito iureiurando, in concione abrogate " ;
and Van Leeu­ wen "ne pergas, iureiurando interposito, conciones detinere."
This does not seem altogether satisfactory;
and I suspect that, retaining τὰς ἐκκληϭίας, we should substitute for ἴν' ἐπομνύενον some word signifying frequenting or interfer­ ing with;
though nothing so prosaic as ἴν' ἐποιχόμενον, or so far removed from the MS.
reading as ἐνοχλου̑ντ' ἐγώ.
The translation is purposely made vague, to leave the question open.

In Sophoclis Inacho Πλούτωνα vocari qui proprie Πλου̑τος erat divitia­ rum deus Scholiastae credimus;

Igitur Πλούτωνος ἐπείϭοδος est Pluti qui Iovem comitabatur in aedes ingressus cum omni bonorum copia."
See the note on 802 infra.
Πλούτων is used for Πλου̑τος here, just as Πλου̑τος is used for Πλούτων in Thesm.

See the Commentary on line 297 of that play.
Spanheim refers to a frag­ ment of our poet's Tagenistae preserved by Stobaeus (cxxi. 18)—CAR.
Then, after this, he sat him down by Wealth, And first he felt the patients head, and next Taking a linen napkin, clean and white, Wiped both his lids, and all around them, dry.
Then Panacea, with a scarlet cloth Covered his face and head;
then the God clucked, And out there issued from the holy shrine Two great enormous serpents.
WIFE.
0 good heavens !CAR.
And underneath the scarlet cloth they crept
And licked his eyelids, as it seemed to me;
And, mistress dear, before you could have drunk
Of wine ten goblets, Wealth arose and saw.
O then for joy I clapped my hands together
And woke my master, and, hey presto !
both The God and serpents vanished in the shrine.
And those who lay by Wealth, imagine how They blessed and greeted him, nor closed their eyes
The whole night long till daylight did appear.
This is followed by the lines cited and translated in the Commentary on Eccl.
131.732. ἐπόππυϭεν]
Clucked;
see Wasps 626 and the note there.
Not whistled, ἐϭύριϭεν, as it is usually explained.
The two sounds are totally different.733.
δύο δράκοντ' ἐκ του̑ νεώ]
These were the harmless yellow snakes, sacred to Asclepius (see the note on 690 supra), which were always kept in his sanctu­ aries.
Here they come into the dormi­ tory IN του̑ νεὼ, just as in the recorded cure quoted in the Introduction, the serpent comes into the dormitory ἐκ του̑ ἀβάτου which is another name for the νεώς.
The expression ὑπερφυει̑ς τὸ μέ­ γεθος is an exaggeration thrown in to heighten the effect, for the snakes were of no great size.
737.
πρίν ϭε κοτύλας] Δέον εἰπει̑ν " πρὶν εἰπει̑ν at λόγον ἕνα" εἶπε"πρὶν ἐκπι ϭε κοτύλας οἴνον δέκα." ϭκώπτει δὲ τὰς γυναι̑κας ὡς μεθύϭους.-Scholiast.
In­ stead of saying before you could say Pax vobiscum," he says, "before you could drink ten cups of wine";
that being the most rapid operation he can think of.745. ἐγὼ 8' ἐπή̨νουν]
But I kept praising the God (that is, Asclepius) with all my might.
759.
εὐρύθμοις προβήμαϭιν]
The words signify, not the rhythmic cadence of the dancer's step, but the measured tramp of a triumphal procession;
such as that described in Charles Renders "
Put Yourself in his Place
It when the hero goes off escorted by the crowd, and " they carried him in triumphant pro­ cession, with the fiddler playing, and George whistling the favourite tune of ' Raby come home again,' while every sturdy foot beat the hard and ringing road in admirable keeping with that spirit - stirring march."
The present line is in the style of Tragedy, if notAnd I could never praise the God enough For both his deeds, enabling Wealth to see, And making Neocleides still more blind.
WIFE.
0 Lord and King, what mighty power is thine !
But prithee where is Wealth ?
CAR.
He's coming here, With such a crowd collected at his heels.
For all the honest fellows, who before Had scanty means of living, flocking round, Welcomed the God and clasped his hand for joy.
-Though others, wealthy rascals, who had gained Their pile of money by unrighteous means Wore scowling faces, knitted up in frowns,— But those went following on, begarlanded, With smiles and blessings ;
and the old men's shoe Rang out in rhythmic progress as they marched.
Now therefore all, arise with one accord, And skip, and bound, and dance the choral dance, For nevermore, returning home, ye'll hear Those fatal words
No barley in the bin !WIFE.
By Hecate, for this good news you bring I've half a mind to crown you with a wreath
Of barley loaves.
CAR.
Well, don't be loitering now.
The men, by this, are nearly at your gates.
WIFE.
Then I will in, and fetch the welcoming-giftsactually borrowed from some Tragic Play.768.
καταχύσματα]
These were small articles of confectionery, dried fruit, and the like (ἰϭχάδια καὶ τρωγάλια infra 798) which were showered over a newly- purchased slave on his first entrance into his master'a house, ἔφερον yap αὐτὸν, says the Scholiast, παρὰ τὴ̣νἑϭτίαν, Kal καθίζοντες κατὰ τη̑ς κεφαλη̑ς κατέχεον κόλλυβα KaL ἰϭχάδας Kat φοίνικας Kal τρωγάλια KaL ἄλλα τραγήματα· Kal οἱ ϭύνδουλοι ταυ̑ταἤρπαζον. ἐλέγοντο οὖν ταυ̑τα καταχύϭματα.
Bergler refers to a passage in the first speech of Demo­ sthenes against Stephanus, where it is said of a slave who had married his mistress, οὐκ ὤκνηϭε τὴν δέϭποινον γη̑μαι, καὶ ἦ ra καταχύσματα αὐτου̑ κατέχεε τόθ' ἡνίκα ἐωνήθη ταύτη̨ ϭυνοικει̑ν, § 91.
Here the wife speaks of the newly regained sight of Wealth as if it were a newly purchased slave.
The ἐγὼ is relegated to the end of her speech, to bring it into immediate juxtaposition with the ἐγὼ at the commencement of Cario's.
The wife now goes into the house, and with the next line Cario also leaves the stage to meet the travellers returning from the Temple.771.
καὶ προϭκυνω̑ γε]
The stage being thus left empty, Wealth re-enters alone, Chremylus remaining outside for a moment to dismiss the congratulating crowd.
This slight delay on his part was perhaps necessary to allow the actor who had been personating the slave to assume the attire of the master;
Wealth is speaking as he enters, andWherewith to greet these newly-purchased-eyes.
CAR.
And I will out, and meet them as they come.
W E. And first I make obeisance to yon sun ;
Then to august Athene's famous plain, And all this hospitable land of Cecrops.
Shame on my past career !
I blush to think With whom I long consorted, unawares, Whilst those who my companionship deserved I shunned, not knowing.
0 unhappy me !
In neither this nor that I acted rightly.
But now, reversing all my former ways, I'll show mankind 'twas through no wish of mine I used to give myself to rogues and knaves.
CH.
Hang you, be off !
The nuisance these friends are, Emerging suddenly when fortune smiles.
Tcha !
How they nudge your ribs, and punch your shins, Displaying each some token of goodwill.
What man addressed me not ?
What aged groupfirst of all, as Bergler observes, " salutat Solem cuius lucem longo post tempore iam videt, ut solemus amicos salutare ;
deinde terram Atticam quae eum quasi hospitio excipiat."
The Scholiast ex­ plains Παλλάδος κλεινὸν πέδον by τὴν ἀκρόπολιν, and no doubt rightly;
for πέδον is very frequently used to denote sacred ground, and no word could more fitly express the " flat oblong " top of the acropolis which was the special home and sanctuary of Athene.
Hence in Lysistrata 345 the Chorus of Women, praying to the Goddess that they may be the means of delivering Hellas from madness and war, add ἐφ' οἶϭπερ, ὦ χρυϭολόφα Πολιου̑χε, ϭὰς ἔϭχον ἓδρος, meaning the acropolis which they have that morning seized.
The Theatre was open to both the Sun and the Acropolis.782. βάλλ' ἐς κόρακας]
Now Chremylus enters, with difficulty extricating him­ self from the throng of adulators, of whose great affection for himself he was not even aware until it had been noised about that Wealth had visited his house.
At the first rumour of his prosperity they at once make their appearance (ol φαινόμενοι) like a cloud of gnats at the first gleam of sunshine.
787.
περιεϭτεφάνωϭεν]
Encircled.
"quae me turbae senilis corona non cinxit in foro ?
"—Hemsterhuys.788. ὦ Φίλτατ' ἀνδρω̑ν]
Now the wife of Chremylus returns with her κατα­ χύϭματα, and gives to both her husband and Wealth a hearty welcome to the house.795.
ὤϭπερ νόμος]
As the custom is.
See the note on 768 supra.796.
τὸν φόρτον]
The vulgar stuff, which sought to raise a laugh by mere farcical buffoonery, and not by the genuine wit and humour of the Comic Play.
This vulgarity Aristophanes always strove to banish from the Attic stage;
see Clouds 537-44, Wasps 57-66, Peace 739-50.
In the last-mentioned Comedy he is supposed to have departed from his own rule by allowing the servant, during the sacrifice there re­ presented, to throw grain among the audience;
but I doubt, as Trygaeus in the play seems to have doubted, if any was really thrown.
797.
οὐ γὰρ πρεπω̑δες]
Wealth refuses to have the καταχύϭματα showered on the open stage for two reasons;
(1) be­ cause it would not be πρεπω̑δες to himself (see four lines above):
and (2) because it would not be πρεπω̑δες to the Poet.
The use of the definite article shows that he does not mean any Poet, but is referring directly to the Poet whose play he is now representing.
A trick of this sort, he means, would be un-Failed to enwreathe me in the market-place ?
WIFE.
Dearest of-men, 0 welcome you and you.
Come now, I'll take these welcoming-gifts and pour them O'er you, as custom bids.
WE.
Excuse me, no.
When first I'm entering with my sight restored Into a house, 'twere meeter far that I Confer a largess rather than receive.
WIFE.
Then won't you take the welcoming-gifts I bring ?
WE.
Aye, by the hearth within, as custom bids.
So too we 'scape the vulgar tricks of farce.
It is not meet, with such a Bard as ours, To fling a shower of figs and comfits out Amongst the audience, just to make them laugh.
WIFE.
Well said indeed:
for Dexinicus there Is rising up, to scramble for the figs.
CAR.
How pleasant 'tis to lead a prosperous life,worthy of Aristophanes, who has always set himself against such means of raising a laugh.
800.
Δεξίνικος]
The Scholiasts are not sure who Dexinicus was, but rather suspect him to have been a grasping officer who never let slip any oppor­ tunity of gaining some advantage for himself.
After this little sally of the wife they all go into the house, and the stage is left vacant.
Here, in the earlier Comedies, would have come a Choral song to pass the time before the re-entry of Cario.
Henceforth he and Chremylus come out by turns;
they are never on the stage together.
Cario interviews the Good Man and the Informer;
then Chremylus, the Old Lady and her Young Man ;
then Cario, Hermes;
and finally Chremylus the Priest and the Old Lady again.802.
ὡς ἡδὺ πράττειν]
Again some interval must be taken to have elapsed, and Cario now comes from the house to recount the wonderful things that are taking place within.
Everything is changed by the advent of Wealth.
The bins are overflowing with grain, and the flagons with wine.
The vessels are heaped full of silver and gold;
the cisterns are running over with oil;
the commonest utensils are changed, some into silver, some into bronze;
whilst as for golden staters, they are so plentiful that the very servants use them, as we might say, for pitch and toss.
The Scholiasts tell us that all this is adum­ brated from a scene in the Inachus of Sophocles, where Zeus (seemingly ac­ companied by Wealth, see on 727 supra) enters into the house and immediately πάντα μεϭτὰ ἀγαθω̑ν ἐγένετο.805.
ἐπειϭπέπαικεν]
Has broken in upon us, as if he were speaking of a hostile irruption.
And the words which follow, οὐδὲν ἠδικηκόϭιν, may either carry on the idea, though we had done it no wrong (supra 428, 457. ὑβρίϭαμεν avrov οὐδὲν ἠδικηκότα, St. Chrysostom, Horn. V in Rom. 470 A), or mean generally though we had done no wrong;
such good fortune having been the appanage, until now, of the ἄδικοι rather than the δίκαιοι, supra 28-38, 502-4.
One Scholiast says ἐπειϭπέπαικεν· εἰϭεπηδήϭε, κυρίως ἐπὶ ϭτρατείας πολεμίων, διὸ παίζων ἐπήνεγκεν "οὐδὲν ἠδικηκόϭιν."
And another παίζων του̑τό φηϭιν, ὡς τω̑ν πολλω̑ν ἐξ ἀδικίας μόνης πλουτούντων806. ἡ ϭιπύη] 'H ἀρτοθήκη.
—Scholiast.
The barley with which it is full is termed white, both because as the Scho­ liast says, προύχει τὰ λευκὰ τω̑ν ἀλφίτων, and also by way of contrast with the μέλας tvos, though μέλας, which in Homer is a frequent epithet of both blood and wine, does not really mean black, but blood-red. " The King sits in Dumferling toune, Drinking the bluid­ reid wine."
On οἶνος ἀνθοϭ μίας, wineAnd that, expending nothing of one's own.
Into this house a heap of golden joys Has hurled itself though nothing wrong we've done.
Truly a sweet and pleasant thing is wealth.
With good white barley is our garner filled
And all our casks with red and fragrant wine.
And every vessel in the house is crammed With gold and silver, wonderful to see.
The tank overflows with oil;
the oil-flasks teem With precious unguents;
and the loft with figs.
And every cruet, pitcher, pannikin, Is turned to bronze;
the mouldy trencherlets
That held the fish are all of silver now.
Our lantern, all at once, is ivory-framed.
And we the servants, play at odd-or-even With golden staters;
and to cleanse us, usewith a bouquet, see Frogs 1150 and the note there.
815.
ἰπνός]
The word has many signi­ fications;
but in this passage it no doubt means'a lantern, as it does in Peace 841 ἰπνοὺςἔχοντες ἐν δὲ τοι̑ς ἰπνοι̑σι πυ̑ρ.816.
στατη̑ρσι]
These were not Athe­ nian coins;
but gold staters were issued by many states, such as Lydia, Cyzicus, and Lampsacus, and were frequently found in Athens.
Their value varied, but possibly we should not be far wrong in estimating their average value to be that of an English guinea.
Though not uncommon in Athens, they had hitherto been extremely uncommon in the house­ hold of Chremylus.
But now they are so abundant that the very servants play even or odd with them;
a boyish game, where one holds out his closed hand, and the other guesses whether the articles it contains are of an even or odd number.
Several references to the game are collected by Spanheim and others;
such as Plato, Lysis, chap. 3 (206 E) οἱ παι̑δες του̑ ἀποδυτηρίου ἐνγωνία̣ ἠρτίαζον ἀστραγάλοις παμπόλλοις;
Horace, Satires ii.
3. 248 " Ludere par impar " ;
and the letter of Augustus to his daughter in Suetonius (Oct. 71) "Misi tibi denarios ducentos quinquaginta, quos singulis convivis dederam, si vellent inter se inter coenam vel tails vel par impar ludere.
"817. οὐ λίθοις]
No longer with stones, which were usually employed for that purpose;
see the note on Peace 1230.
This is the point of a little interchange of amenities between two courtesans (Athenaeus xiii. 41), one of whom was supposed to be afflicted with the stone, and the other with an incapacity to resist the calls of nature.
What, have you got the stone, my girl?
Gnathaena once to Mania cried.
And if I had, I'd give it tou, To cleanse yourself, the girl replied.819. βουθυτει̑]
Some think that the first syllable of this word has merely the augmentative force which it fre­ quently possesses in compounds, as in βουλιμια̢̑ιnfra 873.
But it is more probable that βουθυτει̑ν originally meant strictly to sacrifice an ox, and then became applicable to any sacrifice, whatever the victim.
See Birds 1232.
So also, observes Spanheim, βουκόλοι is the ordinary designation of shepherds.
Chremylus, we are told, wore a wreath when in the act of sacrificing;
and this was the universal custom.
"To Xenophon, when he was sacrificing," says Aelian, V. H. iii. 3, "came one from Mantineia, announcing that his son Gryllus had fallen in the battle.
Xenophon laid aside his wreath, but went on with the sacrifice.
But when the messenger added that he died in the hour of victory [or, as Diogenes Laertius reports the saying, γενναίως, as a brave man should], Xenophon re-Not stones, but garlic-leaves, so nice we are.
And master now, with garlands round his brow, Is offering up hog, goat, and ram within.
But me the smoke drove out.
I could not bear To stay within j it bit my eyelids so.
GOOD MAN.
Now then, young fellow, come along with me To find the God.
CAR.
Eh ?
Who comes here, I wonder.
G. M. A man once wretched, but so happy now.
CAR.
One of the honest sort, I dare aver.G. M. Aye, Aye.
CAR.
What want you now ?
G. M. I am come to thank The God:
great blessings hath he wrought for me.
For I, inheriting a fair estate, Used it to help my comrades in their need, Esteeming that the wisest thing to do.
CAR.
I guess your money soon began to fail.
G. M. Aye, that it did !
CAR.
And then you came to grief.
G. M. Aye, that I did !
And I supposed that theysumed the wreath."
Many illustrations of the custom are given by Kuhn and Perizonius in their notes on this chapter of Aelian..823.
ἕπουκ.τ.λ.]
Such are the effects of the advent of Wealth upon the house­ hold of Chremylus.
We have now to see how the new dispensation affects the outer world.
And first there enters a prosperous and well-dressed citizen, with an attendant carrying a tattered gaberdine and a very disreputable pair of shoes.
This is an honest and worthy person who, so long as Wealth con­ tinued to be blind, was poor and needy, but now finds himself suddenly enriched;
and who is coming, in gratitude, to offer his thanksgiving to the God.833.
κομιδη̂j μὲνου̉ν]
A phrase of hearty assent, frequently employed by Plato;
Republic v. 475 B, Theaetetus 155 A, 202 C, 206 B, &c.
It is here, with comic effect, used three times by the Good Man within the compass of six verses.
The test of friendship which Aristo­ phanes is here describing received its most famous illustration in the case of Timon of Athens, familiar to all English readers from Shakespeare's play.
845.
ἐνεμυήθης] Initiated into the Great Mysteries.
The pure white garment which was worn during the ceremony of initiation was naturally regarded with peculiar reverence;
and, though occasionally used as a robe for a new­ born child, was more frequently dedi­ cated as an offering in the Temple, either of the Twain Goddesses them­ selves, or of some other deity.
But these robes were clean and new, καθαραὶ καὶ νέαι as the Scholiast says, and nothing could resemble them less than the miserable garb which it is now proposed to dedicate to the God.
This can't be the garment you were made a Mystic in, says Cario, laughing.
No, says the other, it is the garment I was nearly made an icicle in.
Cario of course is riot speaking seriously.
σκώπτων εἰς τὰ ἱμάτια του̑τό φησιν, says the Scholiast, ὅτιῥυπαρά ἐστιν. ἔθος δὲει̉χον ἐν οι̉ς τις μυηθείη ἱματίοις raSTa εἰς θεου̑ τινος ἀνατιθέναι.
ἔνιοι δὲ τὰς τοιαύτας στολὰς εἰς τέκνων σπάργανα φυλάττουσι, καθαραὶ δὲ πάνυ ὑπάρχουσι καὶ νέαι.
And another Scho­ liast quotes from Melanthius " On the Mysteries" πάτριόν ἐστιται̑ς θεαι̑ςἀνιερου̑ν καὶ τὰς στολὰς τοὺς μύστας, ἐναι̉ς τύχοιεν μυηθέντες.
As to the words τὰ Μεγάλα the Scholiasts observe Μεγάλα κα Μικρὰ μυστήρια ἐτελου̑ντο ἐν 'Ελευσι̂νι τη̑ςWhom I had succoured in their need, would now Be glad to help me when in need myself.
But all slipped off as though they saw me not.
CAR.
And jeered you, I'll be bound.
G. M. Aye, that they did !
The drought in all my vessels proved my ruin.
CAR.
But not so now.
G. M. Therefore with right good cause I come with thankfulness to praise the God.CAR.
But what's the meaning, by the Powers, of that, That ancient gaberdine your boy is bearing ?G. M.
This too I bring, an offering to the God.CAR.
That's not the robe you were initiate in ?G. M. No, but I shivered thirteen years therein.
CAR.
Those shoes ?
G. M. Have weathered many a storm with me.
CAR.
And them you bring as votive offerings ?
G. M. Yes.CAM
What charming presents to the God you bring !
INFORMER.
0 me unlucky !
0 my hard, hard fate !
O thrice unlucky, four times, five times, yea Twelve times, ten thousand times !
0 woe is me, So strong the spirit of ill-luck that swamps me.850.
οἴμοι κακοδαίμων]
We have witnessed the enrichment of an honest citizen;
we are now to witness the impoverishment of a dishonest knave.
A Common Informer enters, raging with hunger and spite;
ready to launch accusations against every person he meets.
He has brought his witness with him;
for without a witness an Informer was powerless.
Neither in this case nor in the former have we any intimation as to the process by which the change was effected.
Enough for us to know that the good man was poor and is rich ;
and the bad man was rich and is poor.
853.
συγκέκραμαι]
He is probably alluding to Creon's lamentation (Soph. Antig. 1310) δείλαιος ἐγὼ, δειλαία̩ δὲ συγκέκραμαι ava.
But having laid stress on the word κακοδαίμων just before, he says αυγκέκραμαι δαίμονι, and inasmuch as he has described himself as μυριάκις κακοδαίμονα, he says πολυφόρψ (manifold, multitudinous) συγκέκραμαιδαίμονι.
But πολυφόρ
ος is not the apt word for this purpose;
and no doubt the Scholiast is right in suggesting that the poet is playing upon another meaning of συγέ­ κραμαι, I am mingled as water with wine.
For πολυφόρ
ος is used of strong wine which can bear a large admixture of water, πολὺ ὕδωρ δεχόμενος (Scholiast).
Cf. Knights 1187.
Both these passages are cited by Bergler.
CAR.
Apollo shield us and ye gracious Gods,
What dreadful misery has this poor wretch suffered ?
INF.
What misery quoth'a ?
Shameful, scandalous wrong.
Why all my goods are spirited away Through this same God, who shall be blind again
If any justice can be found in Hellas.G. M. Methinks I've got a glimmering of the truth.
This is some wretched fellow, come to grief j
Belike he is metal of the baser sort.
CAR.
Then well done he to come to wrack and ruin.
INF.
Where, where is he who promised he would make All of us wealthy in a trice, if only
He could regain his sight ?
Some of us truly
He has brought to ruin rather than to wealth.
CAR.
Whom has he brought to ruin ?

Me, this chap.

One of the rogues and housebreakers perchance ?
INF.
0 ay, by Zeus and you're quite rotten too.
'Tis you have got my goods, I do believe.

'Tis plain he's hunger-mad.

There to be broken on the wheel, and forced To tell your misdemeanours.
CAR.

Racked, broken on the wheel.
He is threatening Cario, a slave, with a slave's punishment.
See the note on Frogs 618.
And cf. Peace 452, Lys. 846.
It would seem from this passage that torture was inflicted in the agora.880.
καὶ σύ]
Now for the first time he turns from Cario, and directs his question to the Good Man.
The ἱμάτιον of to-day is contrasted with the τριβώνιον of yesterday, just as in Plato's Symposium, chap. 34 (219 B), the ἱμάτιον of Alcibiades is contrasted with the τρίβων of Socrates.884. Εὐδάμου]
Eudamus, possibly, as Hemsterhuys suggests, the Eudemus of Theophrastus (Hist. Plant, ix. 17), was a vendor of magic charms and amulets designed to protect the wearer from the poisonous bite of a snake or other malignant influence.
No doubt the purpose of the charm was inscribed upon it, like a love-posy in an engagement ring.

This is of course one of the commonest and most unmeaning of Greek imprecations.
See supra 279, Birds 2, 1257, Frogs 955, Eccl. 803.
But in the present passage Cario appears to employ it with special reference to the Informer's accusation. "
You say that we are going to feast off your goods;
may you cram yourself with those we have got till you burst asunder."
And as they had nothing of his, this would involve his bursting asunder μηδενὸς ἐμπλήμενος. 895.

This line, as Bentley pointed out, is naso, non ore, efferendus.
It represents a succession of sniffings, produced by the nose ;
and not words or inarticulate sounds spoken with the mouth.
In the Greek text, they form twelve syllables, to accord with the metre of the dialogue;
in the transla­ tion they are, for the same reason, necessarily reduced to ten.897.
τριβώνιον]
The Informer's garb, though not so utterly disreputable as the discarded gaberdine of the Good Man, seems to have been in much the same condition as that of his fellow- Informer in the Birds.
See line 1416 of that Comedy.903. γεωργὸς εἶ;

In like manner Demosthenes, describing Aristogeiton (i. 60-63) as one who συκοφαντῶν οὐκ ἐπαύετο, says that there are 20,000 Athenians who resort to the agora for some useful business.
Aristogeiton alone has no business, ού τέχνης, οὐ γεωργίας, οὐκ ἄλλης ἐργασίας ἐπιμελεīται, but he walks through the agora with his sting erect, looking about to see whom he can attack, and from whose fears he may hope to extort a bribe.904.

An ἔμπορος, as another Scholiast observes, is a merchant κατὰ θάλατταν ἐμπορίαν ποιοί­ μενος.
And the law of Athens, for the encouragement of commerce (I am borrowing from my own Commentary on the Ecclesiazusae), wisely exempted every bona fide merchant from liability to military service.

doubt sought to avail themselves of this exemption by pretending to be merchants when they were not really so.
This is the fraud which the In­ former here alleges that he was in the habit of practising whenever the occasion arose.907.
ἐπιμελητής]
A superintendent, curator;
the ordinary title of an official entrusted with any special charge;
ἐπιμελητὴς τω̑ν νεωρίων, ἐπιμεληαὶ τω̑ν κρηνω̑ν and the like.
The title occurs very frequently both in literature and in the inscriptions.
Here the Informer means that all public and private affairs are under his special charge.
See infra 920 and the note there.908.
βούλομαι]
In certain cases it was open not merely to the person aggrieved, but to any one who would, τω̝̑ βουλομέω̢, to take proceedings against a wrong­ doer.
This liberty was given by Solon's laws, and was accounted one of his most democratic measures;
Polity of Athens chap.
ix.
As one example out of many, take the law cited in Demo­ sthenes against Macartatus 71 (p. 1068), the concluding sentence of which is ἀπογραφέτω δὲ TOV μὴ ποιου̑ντα ταυ̑τα ὁ βουλόμενος πρὸς TOP ἄρχοντα
Unfor­ tunately, this liberty gave rise to one of the greatest pests of Athenian life, a race of Common Informers whose profession it was to make a living out of the errors of their fellow citizens.
We saw them at work in the first extant Comedy of Aristophanes ;
we find them, unaltered, in the last.
For the speaker here means, I am o βου­ λόμενος, I am the Common Informer, I am the man who avail myself of Solon's permission to harry my fellow Athenians.
His auditors at once appre­ ciate his meaning;
and the allusion is continually recurring in the ensuing dialogue.
910.
ρποσῆκον μηδέν]
If, it being no business of yours, you are hated:
that is, do things worthy of hatred.
Si in its quae nihil ad te attinent, odium tibi concilias, as Bergler translates it, and his translation is adopted by Brunck.
And the Scholiasts say εἰ διὰ τῶν πραγ­ μάτων τῶν σοὶ μηδὲν διαφερόντων ἀπεχθάνει TO'IS ἀνρώποις, and again Sta τὸ ἐπιχειρεῖν ἀλλοτρίοις πράγμασιν.
But it seems very probable, and the Informer's answer makes it almost a certainty, that a line has dropped out, a line recording the conduct which removed the Informer from the ranks of the χρηστοὶ, and made him an object of universal hatred.
The translation gives the sense required rather than the strict meaning of the Greek as it stands.
The words προσῆκον μηδὲν are used absolutely.912. ὦ κέπφε]
There is an excellent description of the κέπφος in the para­ phrase of " Dionysius on Birds " ii. 10. “There is another bird," writes the paraphrast, " which the fishers call the κέπφος by reason of its lightness, ἐκ τῆς κουφότητος, for it runs with its feet on the top of the waves.
And it is a sign of good-luck to the fishers, for the birds spend their time where there are the largest shoals of fish.
And more especially they accompany the tunnies, to eat the scraps left floating of the little fishes which they (the tunnies) tear to pieces with their teeth.
So again they follow the dolphins to feed on the blood of the fishes which the dolphins kill.
Moreover they eat the foam of the sea.
And no man can easily catch the κέπφοι asleep or idle, either on land or at sea, for they are always either hunting or flying."
This is so unmistakable a description of the Stormy Petrel (Thalassidroma Pelagica, Gould 448) which derives its name from walking on the water, like Saint Peter, that the identity of the two birds is universally admitted.
The notion that the Petrel eats the foam of the sea is mentioned by Aristotle (N. H. ix. 35) οἁ δὲ κέπφοι ἁλίσκονται τῷ ἀφρῷ· κάπτουσι yap αὐτὸν, and by the Scholiasts here, who say that boys are able to catch it while it is greedily eating the sea-foamCAR.
You virtuous, housebreaker ?

INF.
What, think you, booby, it concerns me not To aid the State with all my might and main ?
CAR.
To aid the State !
Does that mean mischief-making ?
INF.
It means upholding the established laws
And punishing the rogues who break the same.
CAR.
I thought the State appointed Justices For this one task.
IXF.
And who's to prosecute ?
which they have thrown to inveigle it within their reach.
And one of them puns, rather smartly, on the words ἅφρων, foolish, and ἀφρὸς, foam ;
ὄρνεον ἄφρον, he says, ὄπερ φιλεῖ ἀφρὸν θαλάττιον ἐσθίειν.
That the Petrel snaps up the top of the surge is a fact;
but its food is not the sea-foam itself, but the spawn and the tiny mollusca within it.
As the Petrel is now far from being con­ sidered an example of stupidity, it is perhaps permissible to resort, as I have done, to the "Booby" of the New World.916.

He is merely anticipating the argument of Jeremy Bentham, who throughout his volumin­ ous works loses no opportunity of laud­ ing and magnifying the Common In­ former.
I will give a few samples from various treatises.
"
Is the law useful ?
To be so it must be executed ;
and how is it to be executed without an Informer ?
Without this coadjutor, a judge is but an empty name.
Each in his sphere, they co-operate towards the same end.
Shall the judge then be held in honour and the Informer, without whom he is nothing, be vilified and contemned?" (ἀπεχθήσεται, supra 910) Organization of Judicial Establishments, chap. viii.
Tit.
6. And again, "
The execution of the law cannot be enforced, unless the violator of it be denounced;
the assistance of the Informer is therefore altogether as necessary and as meritorious as that of the Judge."
Rationale of Reward, i. 13.
And in his Principles of Penal Law, ii. 3. (4) he suggests that a law should be passed for the encouragement of Informers, and that its preamble should contain the following statement.
"
It is the artifice of bad men to seek to draw contempt upon them who by executing the laws would be a check upon their misdeeds.
If the law is just, as it ought to be, the Informer is the enemy of no man, but in proportion as that man is an enemy of the rest.
In proportion as a man loves his country" (φελόπολις, supra 900) " he will be active in bring­ ing to justice all those who by the breach of the laws entrench on its prosperity."
The English pamphleteen has, of course unwittingly, adopted not only the ideas, but the very language, of the Aristophanic Informer.921.

carrying on the allusion to the βούλομαι of 918 supra, to which he again refers, eight lines below.

Battus was­ the leader of the colony from Thera to Cyrene, over which he and his descendants reigned for eight genera­ tions, their names being alternately Battus and Arcesilaus, see Hdt. iv. 150-64. The last of the dynasty was the fourth Arcesilaus in whose honour Pindar composed his fourth and fifth Pythian odes.
Under the Battiadae, Cyrene attained to great wealth and prosperity, its chief export being the famous silphium, highly valued both for its culinary and for its medicinalCAR.

It was a sort of giant fennel, comprising probably both the ferula asafoetida and the ferula tingitana.
The Cyrenaeans recognized their debt to this herb by placing its representa­ tion on their coins.
Probably silphium was at this moment very costly at Athens;
so that "all the silphium of Cyrene" would convey the idea of enormous wealth.928. πρ
οσελθέτω]
The Informer, ac­ customed to be feared by all, pays no heed to Cario's orders, but dares them to " come on."
Come on who will he says.
I am that man who will, responds Cario, borrowing the language which the Informer himself had employed eleven lines before, and so inverting their respective positions.
Cario is now o βουλόμενος, and with the assis­ tance of the Good Man proceeds to strip off the Informer's cloke and shoes.931.
ἀξιοῖς]

ἄξιον κρί­ νεις, as the Scholiasts explain the word both here and on 1080 infra.933.
μάρτυρα]
The witness whom the Informer had with him, has thought it expedient to make his exit;
and, as already observed, an Informer without his witness was in a helpless position.
It is his recognition of that fact which gives force to his despairing μόνος in the following line, and makes him (infra 945) long for a yoke-fellow of the same character as himself.935.

‛Ως ἀνάθημα κρεμα­ σθήσεται. — Scholiast.
The reminder that the τριβώνιον is already a votive offering to Wealth suggests a new idea to Cario.
He will treat the Informer as a stand, or a stock of wild olive within the sacred precincts, whereon such votive offerings were commonly suspended in honour of the God.
The allusions to this custom by Horace (Odes i. 5. 13-16) and Virgil (Aen. xii. 766-9) are too familiar to be cited here.943.

In Virgil, xii. 766, it was in fact on an oleaster that the shipwrecked mariners suspended their dripping gar­ ments, as a votive offering to the God who had saved them from the perils of the deep.
It would seem from 951 infra that the old shoes are actually nailed or fastened to the Informer's mask which had doubtless been fashioned expressly for that purpose.

ra yap σύκινα ξύλα εὐτελῆ καὶ ἄχρηστα, says Zenobius.
It might seem therefore but a feeble prop wherewith to over­ throw TOVTOV τὸν ἰσχυρὸν θεόν;
but on the speaker's lips this feeble wood re­ presents a dangerous συκοφάντης, a Common Informer like himself.

We have seen in the Commentary on 535 supra, that in wintry weather the needy and shivering poor would seek for warmth and comfort by crowding round the bath-room stove.
So in the time of Wealth's blindness the Good Man had done.
So now that Wealth can see, the Informer will have to do.
On κορυ­ φαῖος the Scholiast says ’Επεὶ περι­ ίσταντο περὶ TO πῶρ, ὥσπερ χορὸς, ἐν τοῖς βαλανείοις· κορυφαῖος δὲ, o ἐν χορῷ πρῶτος.958.

The Informer had disappeared after line 950;
and now the Good Man and Cario enter the house;
and the Chorus are alone in the orchestra.
But almost immediately an Old Lady with the flowery frock (infra 1199) and the juvenile manners (infra 963) of a young love-sick girl appears upon the stage.
With her is an attendant, carrying cakes and sweet­ meats on a tray.965.

or, more probably, of myself, meâ sponte, as in Peace 638, Lys. 1107.

Or have we altogether missed the way ?

No, you have really reached his very door, You dear young girl;

O. L. O, then, I'll summon one of those within.
CH.
Nay for, unsummoned, I have just come out.
So tell me freely what has brought you here.
O. L. 0, sad, my dear, and anguished is my lot, For ever since this God began to see My lifers been not worth living;
all through him.
CH.
What, were you too a she-informer then Amongst the women ?
O. L. No indeed, not I.CH.
Or, not elected, sat you judging-wine ?
I think, be doubted that this is a direct reference to the Informer who has just left the stage;
and some have therefore supposed that Chremylus and not Cario must have been the interlocutor in the preceding scene.
But this is not a necessary inference.
Attic Comedy did not trouble itself about inoon­ sistencies and probabilities.
It did not expect a spectator to say How did Chremylus know anything about the συκο­ φάντης ?
The audience knew all about him, and that was enough.972.
ἐν τῷ γράμματι]
When all the ten Courts were sitting, each of the ten dicastic sections would draw at the balloting booths the letter of the Court-house in which it was that day to Bit.
But after the downfall of the Empire there would rarely be sufficient business to occupy all the Courts, and therefore some of the sections would draw blanks, and so would that day hold no sitting, and draw no pay.
See the Commentary on Eccl. 681-3, and on 277 supra.
But some of the poorer citizens would now, as at the date of the Wasps (see lines 304-12 of that play), depend for their meals on their dicastic pay, and many, it appears, were the fraudulent devices to which they would resort to obtain it.
One would attempt to sit in a dicastic section with which he was not really empanelled;
that is the meaning of the present passage.
Another would contrive to enter his name in more than one list, so as to diminish the chance of a blank;
that is the meaning of 1166, 1167 infra.
Frauds of this kind, if detected, were visited with condign punishment:
ἐί τις δικαστὴς εἰσήει μὴ κληρώθεις εἰς TO δικαστ
ήριον, διαφόρψς ἐζημιοῦτο, Scholiast at 277.
See Fritz­ sche, De Sortitione Judicum, pp. 58, 59.
Here ἔπινες is substituted for ἐδίκαζες (or, as Mr. Green suggests, for ἔκρινες), for the sake of the familiar joke on the alleged bibul ous propensities of Athenian women;
and partly also because (except in a γυναικοκρατία) women of course could take no part in dicastic proceedings.
O. L. You jest;
but I, poor soul, am misery-stung.
CH.
What kind of misery stings you ?
tell me quick.
O. L. Then listen.
I'd a lad that loved me well, Poor, but so handsome, and so fair to see, Quite virtuous too;
whatever I wished, he did In such a nice and gentlemanly way ;
And what he wanted, I in turn supplied.
CH.
What were the things he asked you to supply ?O. L. Not many:
so prodigious the respect
In which he held me.
'Twould be twenty drachmas To buy a cloke and, maybe, eight for shoes;
Then for his sisters he would want a gown,
And just one mantle for his mothers use, And twice twelve bushels of good wheat perchance.
CH.
Not many truly were the gifts he asked !
'Tis plain he held you in immense respect.
O. L. And these he wanted not for greed, he swore, But for lovers sake, that when my robe he wore, He might, by that, remember me the more.
CH.
A man prodigiously in love indeed !O. L. Aye, but the scamp's quite other-minded now.
He's altogether changed from what he was.977.
καὶ χρηστόν]
This seems an attempt to explain, what certainly needs explanation, how it was that Wealth had thought fit to enrich a youth of such questionable antecedents.
So again infra 1003.982.
δραχμὰς εἴκοσιν]
Twenty drachmas for a cloke, and eight for a. pair of shoes, appear to have been considerably above the usual prices of these articles;
and Boeckh observes that the youth must either have been asking for a larger sum than he intended to pay, or have con­ templated the purchase of some specially costly kinds;
Public Economy i. 18.
In her love for the youth, the Old Lady thinks little of the presents she lavished upon him, but we are obviously intended to regard them as of con­ siderable magnitude, and the answer of Chremylus is merely ironical.998.
εἰς ἑσπέραν]
The time for lovers' meetings.
See infra 1201, Peace 966, Lys. 412, Eccl. 1047. 999. ἄμητα πρ

But the Scholiast has not seen the point, neither have the Commentators.
These are in the nature of wedding presents, sent by the Old Lady to her lover, as by a bridegroom to the bride.
See Athenaeus xiv. chaps. 49, 50. Thus Alexis, in his Homoea, says- No, by Asclepius, I've no joy in suppers, But, 0, I do love bon-bons (τραγήματα).
For these the bridegrooms, so I'm told, are wont To bring their brides.
With cream-cakes (ἄμητας), hare, and thrushes.
0, I am So fond of these.
And in the same chapter Athenaeus quotes from the Gynaecomania of Amphis, where one speaker enumerates as refined pleasures-1002.
πάλαι ποτ’ ἦσαν] "
The Milesians, before they became immersed in luxury, overcame the Scythians, as Ephorus says, and founded the towns on the Hellespont, and colonized the Euxine sea with splendid cities;
and all men flocked to Miletus.
But when they gave themselves up to pleasure and luxury, the manhood of their city ebbed away,So when I sent him this delicious cake, And all these bon-bons here upon the tray, Adding a whispered message that I hoped To come at even- CH.
Tell me what he did ?O. L.
He sent them back, and sent this cream-cake too, Upon condition that I come no more ;
And said withal, Long since, in war's alarms
Were the Milesians lusty men-at-arms.CH. 0, then the lad's not vicious;
now he's rich
He cares for broth no longer, though before, When he was poor, he snapped up anything.
O. L. 0, by the Twain, and every day before, He used to come, a suppliant, to my door.
CH.
What, for your funeral ?
O. L. No, he was but fainas Aristotle says, and there sprang up a proverb Πάλαι ποτ’ ἦσαν ἄλκμοι Μιλήσιοι,” Athenaeus xii. 26.
The line was originally composed by Anacreon, and was afterwards delivered by the oracle at Branchidae as a response to the Carian delegates who inquired whether they should accept the alli­ ance of the Milesians against King Dareius.
Such is the account given by the Scholiast here, and by the Paroemio­ graphers (Bodleian 776, Zenobius v. 80, Gaisford pp. 95, 368).
Phrases of this kind signify that the state of things to which they refer exists no longer;
like Virgil's fuit Ilium, " Ilium is a thing of the past";
and as, in Measure for Measure, Isabella, abandoning all hope of saving her brother's life, exclaims "I had a brother then," meaning that she has one no longer.
So Cicero, returning from the execution of Cati­ line's accomplices, announced their fate by the single word Vixerunt (ἔζησαντ Plutarch, Cic. 22);
and so Corbulo, recalled by his Master's jealousy from the scene of his anticipated triumphs, merely remarked ὦ μακάριοι οἱ πάκαι ποτε στρατηγήσαντες (Dio Cassius lx. 30);
beatos quondam duces Romanos, Tacitus, Ann. xi. 20. Cf. Wasps 1060.1003. οὐ μοχθηρός]
Here again the poet attempts to show that the youth was not an altogether unworthy reci­ pient of Wealth's bounty.
See on 977 supra.
It was not to gratify his inherent vicious propensities that he responded to the Old Lady's advances.
His poverty and not his will consented.1008. ἐπ’ ἐκφοράν+]

ἐκφέρειν may almost be described as the technical word for “bearing out" the dead.1013.

That is, in the great procession from Athens to Eleusis, the earlier stages of which are so vividly brought before us in the Frogs.
For, as was observed in the Commentary on line 401 of that play, ladies drove the twelve miles in their carriages.
-It is much to be regretted that Professor Tucker in his handy little edition of the Frogs just published, should have repeated the strange theory (which he had previously advanced in the Classical Review) that Aristophanes is there describing the Little Mysteries;
a theory which destroys the whole significance of the episode, and appears to spring mainly from a confusion of the λειμὼν upon which the Chorus are standing at its commencement, with the λεμῶνες, the Thriasian and Eleusi­ nian plains, for which they are depart­ ing at its close.

Θάσιον]
For the Thasian was one of the choicest, and quite the most fragrant, of the old Greek wines.
It is thrice mentioned in these Comedies, and on each occasion allusion is made to its incomparable bouquet.
See Lyui­ strata 196, 206. Eccl. 1119 and the Commentary there.1030.

Otherwise he does not deserve to receive any benefit from Wealth.
For this use of δίκαιος see Clouds 1283, 1434.1033.
οὐυκέτι a-? ζη̂ν]
He considers you dead, now that you are of no further use to him.
A very similar idea is expressed in the Truculentus of Plautus i. 2. 62-5.1036. δτὰ δακτυίου] “
When I was about thy years, Hal, I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring,'' says Falstaff in the first part of Henry IV.
The phrase in the text was, or became, a proverb, ἐπὶ τῶν διὰ λύπην ἤ νόσον ἰαχνῶν γινομένων.
Diogenianus iv. 30, Zenobius iii. 18 (Gaisford's Paroemiographers, pp. 185, 284).
τηλία in the next line is a word of many meanings;
but here it appears to signify the hoop of a sieve ;
κοσκίνου κύκλος, Scholiast;
ἡ περιΦέρεια κοσκίνου, Horus in Etymol. Magn.1040. ἐπὶ κῶμον]
He has been to a wine-party, and is now coming awayO.
L. He'd never leave me all my life, he said.
CH.
And rightly too;
but now he counts you dead.
O. L. My dear, with lovers fierce pangs I've pined away.
CH. Nay rather, grown quite rotten, I should say.
O. L. 0, you could draw me through a ring, I know.
CH.
A ring ?
A hoop that round a sieve could go.O. L. O, here comes he of whom I've been complaining All this long while;
this is that very lad I Bound to some revel surely.
CH.
So it seems.
At least, he has got the chaplets and the torch.
YOUTH.
Friends, I salute you.
O. L. Eh ?
YOUTH.
Mine ancient flame, How very suddenly you've got grey hair.
CH. 'Tis years since last he saw you, I dare say.
O. L. What years, you wretch ?
He saw me yesterday !
On.
Why then his case is different from the rest;
When in his cups, methinks, he sees the best.
O. L. No, this is just his naughty, saucy way.
YOUTH.
0 Gods of eld!
Poseidon of the Main !
What countless wrinkles does her face contain !
O. L. 0! 0 ! Keep your torch off me, do.
CH.
In that she's right.
For if one spark upon her skin should light,for a drunken revel, of which the wreath and the torch were the usual accompaniments.
See Eccl. 691, 692 and the note there.
He is of course in a merry mood, and seeing a man and woman standing in the way, begins to salute them, but stops short on per­ ceiving that it is his ancient flame, and changes his mode of address.
His first word, ἀσπάζομαι, seems to have raised a little flutter of hope in the Old Lady's bosom, which is quickly dispelled as he proceeds.
1050.
Ποντπόόσεδον]
This compound, which does not occur elsewhere, is a mere comic, we might perhaps say, a mere reveller's equivalent of πόντιε Πόσειδον.
The youth has, at all events, got hold of the right Poseidon.
See supra 396.1054.
εἰρειώνην]
This is the harvest wreath, already mentioned in Knights 729 and Wasps 399, and fully described in the note to the latter passage.
It was an olive-branch wreathed with wool in which were stuck figs, bread- cakes, and vessels of honey, oil, and wine, symbols of the harvest and the vintage.
These branches, after being carried about in the festival were hung out above the door of the house, as was the case with the harvest wreaths in the Knights and the Wasps, and would presently become as dry and combusti­ ble as tinder.1057.
ὀδόντας]
The Scholiast says δέον εἰπεῖν κάρυα, εἶπεν ὀδόντας ὡς πρὸς γραυ̂ν, and explains that this was a child's game, something like the "even or odd " mentioned supra 816.
One boy took some nuts, and holding up his closed hand, asked How many have I got?
And if the other guessed right, he won the nuts;
but if be guessed wrong, he had to pay, the Scholiast says as many as the first boy had in his hand ;
but more probably, I imagine, the difference between his guess and the right number.
In the Eutby­ demus of Plato, chap. 21, Ctesippus says to one of the Sophists Οἶσθ' Εὐθύδημον, όπόσους ὀδόντας ἔχει, Kal ὁ Εὐθύδημ
ος'Twould set her blazing, like a shrivelled wreath.
YOUTH.
Come shall we play together ?
O. L. Where ?
for shame !
YOUTH.
Here with some nuts.
O. L. And what's your little game ?
YOUTH.
How many teeth you've got.
CH.
How many teeth?
I'll make a guess at that.
She's three, no, four.
YOUTH.
Pay up ;
you've lost:
one grinder, and no more.
O. L. Wretch, are you crazy that you make your friend A washing-pot before so many men ?
YOUTH.
Were you well washed, 'twould do you good belike.
CH. No, no, she's got up for the market now.
But if her white-lead paint were washed away, Too plain you'd see the tatters of her face.
O. L. So old and saucy !
Are you crazy too ?
YOUTH.
What, is he trying to corrupt you, love, Toying and fondling you when I'm not looking ?
CH.
No, no, by Hecate, I'm not so daft.
But come, my boy, I really can't allow you To hate the girl.
YOUTH.
Hate her ?
I love her dearly.ὁπόσ

but though the language employed resembles that of the present passage, there is of course no allusion there to the childish game.
1061.
πλυνόν με ποιω̂ν]
Making me your washpot, sousing me with dirty water, that is, with abuse.
The verb πλύνειν is frequently used in this sense, as in Ach.
381;
St. Chiys.
Horn. XXV in Hebr. (231 A).1064. ψιμύθιον]
White lead, ceruse, used to whiten the complexion.
See the notes on Eccl. 878 and 929.1066.
οὐχ ὑγιαίνειν μοι δοκεῖς]
She addresses to Chremylus the very words which, six lines above, she had addressed to the Youth.
She is an objectionable old lady, but one cannot help feeling a little pity for her at the way she is being baited by both the old man and the young man.1070.
μὰ τὴν 'Εκάτην]
The old lady having used a girl's oath, μὰ τὴν ΑΦρο­ δίτην, quite inappropriate to her age and appearance, the old man responds with a woman's oath, μὰ τὴν ‛Εκότην, equally inappropriate to his sex.
On the wife's oath by Hecate, supra 764, the Scholiast says καθὰ γυνὴ τὴν 'Εκάτην ὀμνύει. See Lys. 443, 738, Thesm. 858, Eccl. 70, 1097, and the note on Frogs 1362.1079.
τὴν μείρακα]
The girl as you call her, supra 1071.
The words which follow οἶδ' οἶδα τὸν νου̂ν are repeated from Frogs 580.
As to ἀξιοῖς see the note on 931 supra.1081.
o δ' ἐπιρέψων ἐστὶ τίς;
]
These are perplexing words, and I am by no means sure of their meaning.
But I think that the speaker is referring to the Youth's last remark that he will permit Chremylus to carry her off.
That act therefore there is one who will per­ mit, o ἐπιτρέψων.
But when it becomes a question of the youth's deserting her, who is it will permit that ?
who is o ἐπιτρέψων there ?
Dobree refers to a line of Machon (Atbenaeus xiii. chap. 43, p. 580 D), τίς 6' ὁ ἐπιτρέψων ἐστί σοι ;
And possibly τίς o ἐπιτρέψων was a legal or technical formula of some sort.
Hemsterhuys translates "fierine potest ut quisquam permittat et iustum putet ne quid rei amplius ipsi pro solita con­ suetudine mecum sit ?
tarn bene munitum esse suum in hunc adolescentem ius anus arbitrabatur."
And to the like effect Fischer and Beck.
Others ex­ plain the words otherwise.
Dr. Ruther­ ford (Classical Review, x. 100) says "
When Chremylus tells the young man that he can see that he no longer cares to keep company with the old woman, she turns to the spectators and withCH.
Yet she complains of YOUTH.
What?
CH.
Your flouts and jeers, Sending her word Long since, in war's alarms Were the Milesians lusty men-at-arms.
YOUTH.
Well, I won't fight you for her sake, CH.
How mean you ?
YOUTH.
For I respect your age, since be you sure
It is not everybody I'd permit To take my girl.
You, take her and begone.
CH. I know, I know your drift;
no longer now You'd keep her company.
O. L. Who'll permit that ?
YOUTH.
I won't have anything to do with one
Who has been the sport of thirteen thousand-suns.
CH.
But, howsoever, as you drank the wine, You should, in justice, also drink the dregs.
YOUTH.
Pheugh !
they're such very old and fusty dregs !
CH.
Won't a dreg-strainer remedy all that?
YOUTH.
Well, go ye in.

The wreaths I am wearing to this gracious God.O. L. Aye then, I want to tell him something too.
YOUTH.
Aye then, I'll not go in.
CH. Come, don't be frightened.
supreme confidence in her charms, demands
Is there a man of you all who will let him keep company with me ? ' "
But this really seems exactly the reverse of her meaning.
It is his desertion of her, and not his keeping company with her, which requires the permission that it will not obtain.
Nor does she anywhere display any confidence in the power of her own charms.1082.
διεπλεκωμένη] Συνουσιασμένῃ, διεΦθαρμένῃ.—Scholiast.
From σπλεκόω, or πλεκόω, akin to πλέκω.
Cf. Lys. 152.
One who has been embraced by 13,000 ἐτω̂ν, an expression intended to suggest 13,000 comrades (from ἔτης) but really meaning 13,000 years (from ἔτος).
λίαν πολλῶν πολιτῶν, says one Scholiast;
χρόνων ἤ πολιτῶν, another;
τὸ ἐτῶν προσέθηκε, σκώ πτων αὐτὴν ὡς γραυ̂ν, a third.
Perhaps the word suns in the translation maybe taken as a play upon sons.
13,000 is of course the usual comic exaggeration;
and the number thirteen, as Van Leeuwen ob.
serves, is often used to signify a round or indefinite number;
cf. supra 194, 846.
And see the remarks of Mr. Elmore and Dr. Postgate in Classical Review, xix 436.
The words οὐκ ἄν διαλεχθείην, I will have no converse with, I will have nothing to do with, occur in the like sense in Clouds 425.1096.
ὣσπερ λεπάς]
Aristophanes had already alluded in the Wasps to the marvellous power of adhesion which the limpet is known to possess;
ὥσπερ λεπὰς, προσεχόμενος τῷ κίονι, Wasps 105.
He could hardly have selected a more remarkable instance of tenacity.
Its body, divested of the shell, weighs barely half an ounce ;
yet it is said that to detach it from its rock in any direc­ tion requires a force of nearly 30 pounds, or 960 times its own weight, whilst to pull it off in the line of its adhesion requires a force of 62 pounds and up­ wards, or 1984 times its own weight.-
After this line they all go into the house, and the door is shut.
Hermes enters, knocks at the door, and im­ mediately conceals himself.
Cario opens the door and sees nobody.
Coming out in a hurry, he has in his hand a χύτρα, containing κοιλίας (infra 1169) and dirty water (infra 1133).1099.
κλαυσιᾷ]
Desires to weep.
Eu­ stathius (on Od. xxi. 50), referring to the present passage, appears to explain κλαυσια̂ν by the words ἐθέλειν κλαίειν.
The Scholiast and most Commentators explain it here by ἠχεῖ, gemit, whines, and that seems to have been the idea of Eustathius, who is contrasting Homer's door which roars like a bull, ἠὑτε ταυ̂ρος I βοσκόμενος λειμῶνι, with the door ofWhy, she won't ravish you.
YOUTH.

Tight as a limpet to her poor young man.

who's knocking at the door ?
Hallo, what's this !
'Twas nobody it seems.
The door shall smart, Making that row for nothing.
HERMES.
Hoi, you sir, Stop, Cario !
don't go in.
CAR.
Hallo, you fellow, Was that you banging at the door so loudly ?
HERM.
No, I was going to when you flung it open.
But run you in and call your master out, And then his wife, and then his little ones, And then the serving-men, and then the dog, And then yourself, and then the sow.
CAR. (Severely.)
Now tell me
What all this means.
HERM.
It means that Zeus is goingAristophanes which ἐθέλει κλαίειν ὠσεὶ νεογιλὰ σκυλάκα.
But this would make Φθεγγόμενον almost superfluous, and it seems far better to take it, as the Oxford Lexicographers do, in the sense of wants to be punished, calls for punishment.
The idea is precisely the same as that expressed in 276 supra.
The adverb ἅλλως means, as frequently elsewhere, without any reason.
1102. μὰ Δί']
"This is a direct false­ hood," say Messrs.
Fielding and Young, in a note to their prose translation of the play ;
and the observation, however dis­ courteous, is undoubtedly just.
Compare Eccl. 553 for another "direct falsehood ” clinched with the same oath μὰ Δία.1106.
τὴν ὗν]
That pigs were kept within the outer door, αὔλειος θύρα, we know from Wasps 844, where see the note.
And indeed this was the case with all the domestic animals.
Vitru­ vius (vi. 10) tells us that when you entered the outer door, the stables, equilia, were on one side, and the porter's lodge on the other.
And hence it was that in Wasps 179 the donkey is brought out through the outer door;
just as, when Marius was taken a prisoner to Fannia's house at Minturnae, τῶν θυρῶν ἀνοιχθισῶν, ὄνος ἔνδοθεν ἐχώρει.
Plutarch, Marius, chap. 38.
The βάρα­ θρον into which all these unfortunates were to be plunged has already been mentioned, supra 431.1110.
ἡ γλῶττα ... τέμνεται ]
The phrase ἡ γλῶττα χ
ωρὶς τέμνεται is illustrated in the notes on Peace 1060 and Birds 1705 ;
but its combination here with the dative τῷ κήρυκι requires some further con­ sideration. "
They poured libations," says Athenaeus (i. 28), speaking of the Homeric age, " when they rose from supper;
and they poured them to Hermes, and not, as in later times, to Zeὺs τέλειος:
for Hermes is considered the patron of sleep.
And to him too they pour libations over the tongues [of the victims] as they depart from their supper;
for tongues are assigned to him, as the interpreters of thought, διὰ τὴν ἑρμηνίαν";
the last word of course referring to the name 'Ερμη̂ς.
Its meaning may be illustrated from Aristotle, De Part.
An. ii. 17, where it is said of birds χρῶνται τῃ̂ yΧὼττῃ καὶ πρὸς ἑρμηνείαν ἀλλήλοις πάντες μὲν, ἕτεροι δὲ τῶν ἑτέρων μα̂λλ
ον.
The Scholiasts say ἡ γλῶττα τῶν θυομένων τῷ ‘Ερμῃ̂ δίδοται, ἐπειδὴ τῶν λόγων δεσπότης ἐστίν.
... Καλλίστρατος τῶν θυομἐνων
Φησὶ τὰς γλώσσας τοῖς κήρυξιν ἀπονέμεσθι (so Suidas, s. v. and Proverb Coislin 238, Gaisford, p. 141) διὸ καὶ TOV ποιητὴν τῷ 'Ερμῃ̂ ποιεῖν τεμνομένας αὐτάς.... πρὸς §€ TO λεγόμενον ἔπαιξεν " 'H γλῶττα τῷ κήρυκι.”
It must be remembered that Hermes was the herald of the Gods, and the patron of earthly heralds;
and indeed the caduceus which he bore was merely the κηρὑκειον of the herald.
It would seem that the tongues of the victims were cut out separately for the Herald Hermes;
and then, the party breaking up to retire to their rest (seeTo mix you up, you rascal, in one dish, And hurl you all into the Deadman's Pit!CAR.
Now for this herald must the tongue be cut.
But what's the reason that he is going to do us Such a bad turn?
HERM.
Because ye have done the basest
And worst of deeds.
Since Wealth began to see No laurel, meal-cake, victim, frankincense, Has any man on any altar laid Or aught beside.

But now I idly cross my legs and starve.
the Scholiast at Apoll. Rhod. i. 517), poured wine over the tongues, andoffered them to the God.
Hence arose the proverb ἠ γλῶττα τῷ Κήρυκι.
Hermes in the present scene has come as the herald of ill tidings ;
and Cario, adopting the proverb, gives a different turn to its meaning;
for on his lips it signifies
The herald of this bad news shall have his tongue cut out;
εἴθε ἐκκοπείη, as the Scholiast explains it.1115.
οὐ ψαιστὸν, οὐχ ἱερεῖον]
No meal- cake, no victim;
no offering by rich or poor.
See supra 138.
The anticipation there expressed has now come true;
and the Gods are in the same straits as when they were walled off by Peisthe­ taerus in the Birds.1119.
σωφρονῖς]
Ah, now you are talking sense.
This special care of Number One appeals at once to the instincts of Cario, as being more appro­ priate to the feelings of a slave than the high-flown threats and lamentations which Hermes has been pouring forth on account of his master.
1121.
οἰνου̂τταν]
Tipsy-cake.
It is obvi­ ous that as honey was the distinctive ingredient of the μελιτου̂ττα, so wine must have been the distinctive ingredi­ ent of the οἰνου̂ττα.
The Scholiasts tell us that either the flour was mixed with wine instead of water preparatory to being made into dough, or else the οἰνου̂ττα was a πλακου̂ς flavoured with wine as well as with honey.1123.
ἀναβάδην]
With my feet up.
ἄνω ἔχων τοὺς πόδας.
-Scholiast.
Hermes, the lackey of Olympus (Peace 180), finds his occupation gone;
he has nothing to do but to sit with his feet up, and starve.
This is the regular meaning of ἀναβάδην, and whatever may be thought of its usage in the Achar­ nians, is clearly its meaning here.
For the expression ἀναβάδην καθήμενος, ἀνα­ βάδην καθἰζειν, Hemsterhuys refers to Pollux iii. 90 and vi. 175, and Athenaeus xii. 38.
It is impossible to accept Toup's explanation, " but now I go to bed hungry, and lie in a garret."1124. ἐποἰεις ζημἰαν]
'Αντὶ τοῡ ἐποίει ζημιου̑σθαι τοὺς ταυ̑τα τἀ ayadd σοι παρἐ­ χοντας.
-Scholiast.
Enimvero iure nunc esuris, qui damnum aliquando cauponis adferres, unde tot commoda percipiebas.
—Hemsterhuys.
We are not told in what manner Hermes had caused loss" to the tavern-keepers, but doubtless Cario is referring to some recent events or event, well known to the audience.
In Peace 1226 an unsaleable article is said ποιει̑ν ζημίαν to the tradesman who bought it;
and possibly there had lately been some unlucky speculations on the part of the tapsters which might reason­ ably be laid at the door of ‘Ερμη̑ς ἐμπολαι̑ος.
Or again they may have been the victims of some notable thefts, and Hermes we know was the God of thieves;
ώς τοῡ ‘Ερμου̑ χαίρονς ται̑ς κλοπαι̑ς.—Schol. on Peace 402.
But these are only samples of the manner in which he might have shown his in­ gratitude :
there are many other ways in which he might have done so.
He now indulges in a series of unavailing regrets, each in turn eliciting a cynical retort from Cario.1127.

first complaint Cario quotes a line from some unknown Tragedy, referring to the fruitless search of Heracles for his lost love Hylas.
Hylas was drowned in a spring of fresh water on the southern coast of the Propontis, a Naiad, it was said, out of love for his beauty having drawn him down to herself through the pellucid water as he stooped over it filling his pitcher.
The story is told by Apol­ lonius Rhodius in his first book, and is a favourite topic of the poets.
And it was believed that after the other Argo­ nauts had sailed away on their quest, Heracles still vainly seeking and call­ ing for his friend heard a voice from Heaven saying ποθει̑ς τὸν οὺ παρόντα καὶ μἀτην καλει̑ς.1129.
ἀσκωλἰαζε]
Play the game of leaping on bladders, from ἀσκὸς, with a play on κωλη̑ (the victim's leg) in the preceding line.
This leaping on blad­ ders was a rustic amusement at the Attic Dionysia.
The player hopped on the top of an inflated bladder (like our football), and tried how long he could keep his balance in that position.
Brunck refers to the well-known passage in which Virgil says that the Athenians, at their Dionysia, inter pocula laeti | Mollibus in pratis unctos saluere per utres.
—Georgics ii. 384. 'Ασκώλια ἧν With the language of the line compare Thesm.
1001.1132. ἴσον ἴσω̜
Half wine and half water, οἶνον ἵσον ἲσω̜ κεκραμἐνον ὕδατι, to use the fuller description given by Hippocrates.
Cf. Acharnians 354.
The phrase is frequently found in Athenaeus, and in the Greek medical writers.
And as the ordinary proportion for moderate drinkers was three parts water to one part wine (Hesiod, W. and D. 596;
An­ thology ,Evenus 15) the Scholiast is quite justified in calling this " half and half" ζωρότερον pretty strong:
though to the two young lovers in Aristaenetus (i. 3) it seemed a modest and proper mixture.
As a substitute for this delicious draught, the very memory of which is sweet to Hermes, Cario offers him a drink of the dirty dish-water he has got in his χύτρα.
See the note on 1096 supra.1138.
ὦν θύεθ' ὐμει̑ς ἒνδον]
The savour of the cookery going on behind the scenes is as alluring to Hermes as it had previously been to the Informer.
" If Cario would but bring him out a loaf done to a nicety (εἷ πεπεμμἑνον), and a fresh juicy piece of meat! "
But these things Cario tells him are οὐκ ἒκφορα, not to be brought out.1141.
ἐφ ᾦ τε μετέχειν καἰτός]
On condition that you had a share yourself.
So in the Merry Wives of Windsor, when Falstaff is protesting that his favour had enabled Pistol's many thefts to remain undetected, Didst thou not share ?
Hadst thou not fifteen pence ?

This was " a large conical white cake, stuffed with al­ monds and raisins, and with that mix­ ture of blood and other rich ingredients which was called καρύκη."
See the Commentary on Birds 567.
Cario borrows the epithet εὖπεπεμμένος from Hermes who had used it six lines above.1146. φυλήν]

Phyle as Thrasybulus did, then grant an amnesty (μὴ μνησικακήσῃς) as Thrasy­ bulus did.
The capture of Phyle was the great initial success of Thrasybulus in his campaign to overthrow the Thirty, and restore the democratic con­ stitution of Athens.
The Amnesty was the end which crowned the work of that campaign.
Like Thrasybulus,
Hermes means, you have had your success;
like him therefore proclaim an amnesty, and bear no malice for what was done in former times.
The words of the oath taken by all the people under the Amnesty of Thrasybulus are preserved by Andocides (de Mysteriis ing sentences of the Second Book of Xenophon'a Hellenics.

Bergler refers to a statement of Lysias (against Philo 6) that citizens who hold ὠς πα̑σα γη̑ πατρἰς ἐστιν αὐτοι̑ς iv ᾖ ἆν TO.

and Hemsterhuys to the saying attributed by Cicero to Teucer, Patria est ubicumque est bene, Tusc. Disp. v. 37, and to Davies's note there.
1153.
στροφαῖον]
Hermes now enu­ merates several of his special characters (see the note on Frogs 1144) in the hope that one or other of them may win him an entrance into the house of Chremylus.
He proposes himself as (1) Στροφαῖος the Hinge-God, so called because his statue was placed close to the hinge (στροφεὺς, Thesm. 487) of the outer door, ὲπὶ ὰποτροπῇ τῶν ἄλλων κλεπτῶν, as the Scholiast here says.

This of course is one of his commonest titles at Athens, in the Tragic, no less than in the Comic, poets.
He was the patron of, and himself the chief expert in, all manner of thieving, knavery, and deceit. (4) ‛Ηγεμόνιος, the Guide-god.
He was always the agent deputed by Zeus to conduct gods or men or dreams or the spirits of the dead to their appointed destinations.
The Scholiast says that there was a statue to Έρμῆς ήγεμόνιος at Athens;
and Pausanias mentions several places in which he was worshipped under that name.

And Pindar speaks of ὲναγώνιος Έρμᾱς in Pyth. ii. 10 and of άγώνιος Έρμᾱς in Isthm. i. 60, refer­ ring to him, on each occasion, as the awarder of the prize in the chariot races.
In Heliodorus x. 31 Theagenes an accomplished wrestler is described as τὴν έναγώνιον 'Ερμοῦ τέχνην ὴκριβωκώς.1156.
παλιγκάπλον]
The Scholiast tells us that the trader who sold his own productions in his own country was called an αὺτοπώλης :
that he who bought them and resold in the same country was strictly called a κάπηλ
ος :
that the ἒμπορ
ος was a merchant who bought (whether from the αὺτοπώλης or from the κάπηλος) for sale in another country ;
and that the παλιγκάπηλ
ος was the trader in the foreign country who bought from the ἒμπορος and resold there.
St. Chrysostom, in his 38th Horn, in Matth.
430 C, couples καπήλους and παλιγκαπήλους.
And in his 85th Horn. in Id. 810 B he says, " If we, the priests of God, busy ourselves with trafficking for gain, έμπόρων καὶ παλιγκαπήλων ὰναδεχόμεθα φροντίδας.”
In the present passage παλιγκάπηλος seems to mean merely a petty tradesman, a con­ temptuous designation of the God of Commerce:
whilst τρέφειν, which is frequently used in the sense of keeping the lower animals, seems also intended as a term of disparagement.
Cf. Clouds 109, 1407, Wasps 835, Birds 1084, &c.1166. οί δικάζοντες]
This allusion is sufficiently explained in the note on 972 supra.1170.
διακονικός]
Hermes had pre­ sented himself in five of his best-known characters :
but he had omitted that which was perhaps the most prominent of them all;
viz. that he was the 8ιάκονος of Zeus,the διάκτορος’ Αργειφόντης.
This sixth character therefore Cario here supplies.
Let him take the χύτραν which Cario is holding, and set to work at once to wash the κοιλίας.
So he can make himself really useful in the house, and be still o διάκονος Έρμῆς.
Spanheim refers to line 963 of the Prometheus, where the suffering Titan calls Hermes TOP τοῦ τυράννου τοῦ νέου διάκονον.
With this they both go into the house.1171.

Here then, quite at the fag-end of the play, we find that Poverty's forebodings have come true ;
that all men are rich, and none poor;
and that Poverty is consequently banished from the land.

πάρεστιν ἐνθάδε]
The Scholiasts and Commentators understand Chremy­ lus to mean that Wealth himself is the real Zεὺς Σωτήρ;
an interpretation which to my mind is destructive of the wit, and inconsistent with the language, of the passage.
Chremylus merely observes that Zεὺς σωτὴρ, not the real Zεὺς Σωτὴρ is within ;
and he adds that he came of his own spontaneous motion, which was not.
the case with Wealth;
the Priest could not have rejoiced at the good tidings had he received no tidings at all ;
and Chremylus, proceeding to speak of Wealth, does not employ the pronoun αὐτὸν as if he were already the subject of their conversation, but intro­ duces him as τὸν Πλοῦτον.
On the other hand, we have already seen Hermes deserting the Olympian Court for the superior attractions of Wealth;
we have already heard (supra 587) of Zeus's devotion to Wealth, and we know that he is now starving.
And in my judge­ ment Chremylus means that the great Zeus himself has followed the example of Hermes;
so that the Priest, thinking to desert his God for the purpose of entering into the service of Wealth, finds that his God has been beforehand with him, and is already himself snugly ensconced within.1191.
ἀλλὰ περίμενε]
These words are spoken parenthetically, διὰ μέσου as the Scholiast says.
At the mere mention of an impending installation service, the Priest manifests such eagerness and excitement, that Chremylus has for the moment to restrain his impetuosity.
From this point to the close of the play Chremylus is arranging a great religious procession for the purpose of escorting Wealth in triumph to his proper home in the Athenian Treasure-house.

was not much wealth in the Treasury now, owing to the cessation of the tribute paid by the allies, and to the enormous expenditure occasioned by the adhesion of Athens to the anti-Spartan League.
1193.
TOP ὀπισθόδομον]
This was the inner cell at the rear of Athene's Temple in the Acropolis.
But which Athene ?
the Polias or the Parthenos ?
The Scholiast here says that it was the Temple of Athene Polias, that is, the Erectheium ;
ὀπίσω τοῦ νεὼ τη̑ς καλουμένης Πολιάδος Ἀθηνᾶς διπλοῦς τοîχος ἔχων θύραν, ὅπου ἤν θησαυροφυλάκιον.
But most Scholars are in favour of the Parthenon.
Boeckh's argument for this view (Public Economy iii. 20) may be disregarded, being based on the strange assumption that there was no Erec­ theium in existence between 480 and 408 B.C., an assumption which he afterwards acknowledged to be errone­ ous.
But there seems to be no trace of an Opisthodomus in the existing ruins of the Erectheium ;
whereas the Opis­ thodomus of the Parthenon is still traceable, and answers fairly well to the Scholiast's description, διπλοῦς τοῖχος ἔχων θύραν, Leake's Athens i. 559, note.1197.
ἐγὼ δὲ τί ποιῶ]
The Old Lady suddenly reappears from the house, as brisk and as eager as ever.
What is SHE to do ?
She, Chremylus says, shall carry Tag χύτρας in the procession.
For in the religious ceremony of dedicating an altar or Temple, it was customary to offer pots of boiled pulse, εὐχαριστήρια, as the Scholiast says, τη̑ς πρώτης διαίτης.
So in Peace 923 we have ταύτην (sc. τὴν Εἰρήνην) χύτραις ἱδρυτέον, and in a frag­ ment of our poet's Danaides, quoted by the Scholiast both there and here-1206.
ἡ γραῦς]
Γραῦς signifies not only an old woman, but also the scum which rises to the surface of boiled vegetables, soup, milk, and other ἑψήματα.
Bergler refers to Athenaeus xiii.
49, where we are told that once when Menander came away from the theatre out of temper at the failure of his play, Glycera offered him a glass of boiled milk, but he would not have it, ἦν yap ἐφεστηκυῖα γραῦς aira (with a malicious allusion to Glycera's age):
but she merely replied Blow the γραῦς away, and then drink the milk."
And Span­ heim cites Nicander's Alexipharmaca 90 where it said After drawing the milk from the udder, skim off from the draught the glistening scum, φιαρὴν δὲWill come to-night, I'll bear the pots with joy.
CH.
These pots are not like other pots at all.
In other pots the mother is atop, But here the mother's underneath the pot.
CHOR.
'Tis the end of the Play, and we too must delay our departure no longer, but hasten away, And follow along at the rear of the throng, rejoicing and singing our festival song.π
οτοῦ ἀποαίνυσο γρη̑ϋν.”
In a note on Peace 923 (published A.D. 1866) I sug­ gested that the play on the two mean­ ings of the word might to some extent be preserved by the use of our word “mother.”
I do not think that the suggestion had been made before, but it is now universally adopted.1209.
κατόπιν τούτων]
In the rear of the actors.
The actors would depart from the stage;
the Chorus, with dance and song, from the orchestra;
but all are supposed to be combining in one great triumphal procession to the Acropolis;
there to install Wealth, as a perpetual resident, in a place with which he had once been familiar, but to which he had long been a stranger, viz. in the Treasury of the Athenian Republic at the back of Athene's Temple.
THE Plutus, though the last in point of date, is placed first in the selection of Aristophanic Comedies which has come down to our time.
And either for that reason, or because it is really the play most suitable for the commencement of a study of the poet's works, it is found in many more MSS.
than any other of these plays.
In his very valuable articles on "the MSS. of Aristophanes " (in the first volume of " Classical Philology") Professor John Williams
White reckons it to be contained in no less than 148 MSS.
Many of these, I believe, have never been collated and are probably not worthy of collation.
In the following Table are included all those collated by Velsen, Brunck, and other critics, down to and including Dr. Blaydes.R. The Ravenna MS.V.
The first Venetian (No. 474, St. Mark's Library, Venice).
P. The first Parisian (No. 2712, National Library, Paris).
(These four MSS.
have been collated by Velsen.
In the case of R. and V., I have always carefully verified his collations with the photogravures of those MSS.)
P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717).
P3- The fourth Parisian (C. B. 2).
P5- Brunck's own MS.(Brunck's edition is founded on a collation of P. P2. P3. P5.
In the Appendix to the Frogs, I mentioned that P5. had come into the possession of Richard Heber, but I could not trace it further.
Professor
White tells us that it is now in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge.)
The first seventeen editions of Aristophanes enumerated, as being in my possession, at the commencement of the Appendix to the Frogs all contain the Plutus.
After Invernizzi's I have the following editions of the play.
(18) Porson's Plutus.
Cambridge 1820 (edited, after his death, by Dobree).
(19) Bothers first edition.
Leipsic, 1828.(20) Bekker. London, 1829.(21) Cookesley's Plutus. London, 1834 (Text from an earlier edition of Dindorf).
(22) Dindorf.
Oxford, 1835.(23) Bothers second edition.
Leipsic, 1845.(24) Bergk. Leipsic, 1857 (Reprinted 1888).(25) Meineke.
Leipsic, 1860.(26) Holden. London, 1868.(27) Yelsen's Plutus. Leipsic, 1881.(28) Green's Plutus.
Cambridge, 1886.(29) Blaydes.
Halle, 1886.(30) Hall and Geldart.
Oxford, 1900.
We should have expected an edition of the Plutus, commenced by Person and finished by Dobree, to be of inestimable value.
But that is not the case.
Person would not have published the work in its present state.
The notes contain little beyond desultory collations of unimportant MSS.;
and there are few plays of Aristophanes to which these two great scholars have not made contributions of greater value than they have to the Plutus.
The Greek scholia are more abundant on this play than on any other;
and so are the Latin commentaries of modern scholars.
So early as 1549, a good edition of the Plutus, as a separate play, was published in Paris by C. Girard with excellent explanatory notes which are incorporated in the editions of Portus and Bekker.
The latter edition also contains the notes of Hemsterhuys (as he is called in England, though his name was really spelt Hemsterhuis) from his edition published in 1744 of the Plutus with the Greek scholia.
His annotations on the Scholia are almost as valu­ able as those on the play itself.
Fischer's explanatory notes, travelling with great diligence over every portion of the text, were published in 1804 by Kuinoel.
These too are comprised in Bekker's edition.
In 1867 an edition of the play was published at Amsterdam by Kappeyne van de Coppello which I have not seen, but which seems to be sufficiently discussed in Bamberg's Exercitationes Criticae in Aristophanis Plutum, Berlin, 1869.
It is perhaps of interest to add that an edition of the Clouds and Plutus was published in 1528 by Philip Melanchthon.17.
ἀποκρινομένῳ R. Elmsley, Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, Green, and Hall and Geldart.
ἀποκρινομένου V. P. U. the MSS.
generally;
all editions before Brunck;
and Invernizzi and Bothe afterwards.
While this was the accepted reading Bentley suggested ἀποκρινόμενος.
He says “Patet ex verso 19 et 24 Chremylum a servo interrogatum nihil respondisse.
Plutum vero nondum fuisse interrogatum versus 60 ostendit et 52.”—Epist. ad Kuster.
And ἀποκρινό­ μενος is adopted by Tyrwhitt, Person, Brunck, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
But I can see no reason for concluding that Chremylus has not endeavoured to enter into conversation with the stranger before the commencement of the play;
and the peremptory manner in which Cario addresses him in line 56 seems to imply that he had already shown some reluctance to discuss his affairs.
Bentley, of course, was unaware of R.'s reading.27.
καὶ κλεπτίστατ
ον.
In obedience to a suggestion of Kappeyne van de Coppello, Velsen takes these words from Chremylus, and gives them to Cario.
But Velsen, though an invaluable col­ lator, was of no value as an editor.

Hemsterhuys conjectured τυφλὸς which is read by Brunck (without any observation) and Velsen.
Dr. Rutherford would strike out the two following lines, and also lines 146, 205, 769, 848, and 897 of the play, as composed of marginal jottings.

Van Leeuwen reads γένει.56.

I have given this and the following line as they were emended and constituted by Bent­ ley, and are read by Bergk and all subsequent editors except Green.

Bentley's sug­ gestion φράσεις is confirmed by R., but φράσον is read by V. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
Then in the next line Bentley added the note of inter­ rogation, and transferred the last four words to Cario from Chremylus, to whom they are given by the MSS.
and the editions before Brunch.
This transfer was also advocated by Hemsterhuys, and is made by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
61.

Schäfer suggests, and Blaydes reads εὐόργου.64.

generally, and vulgo.

This line is continued to Chremylus by the MSS.
(for Velsen is mistaken in supposing R. to be an exception) and by all editions before Bothe's first.
But Hemsterhuys, and after him Fischer, proposed to transfer it to Cario, and this is done by Bothe, Bekker, and all subsequent editors except Hall and Geldart.
This change seems to me undesirable (see the Com­ mentary) :
but not so much so as Dr. Rutherford's suggestion (adopted by Hall and Geldart) to leave the first four words to Chremylus ;
transfer the next five to Cario ;
and compensate Chremy­ lus by giving him the words ὦ τᾶν from the following line.
For if Chremylus began el μὴ φράσεις yap he must have intended to follow it up by some such threat as that with which the line con­ cludes ;
and it seems unreasonable to assign the sequel to the slave, and leave the master's threat suspended in the air.67.

And except that R. has ἑώρακα, contra metrum (which Invernizzi follows), this is the reading of R. But P. U. and the great majority of the MSS.
have ovx ἑώρακα χρόνου, and this is the reading of all editions before Inver­ nizzi.
V. and a few other MSS.
agree with R., except that for πω they have που.
Dawes suggested the change of που into πω, not knowing that the latter was to be found in any MS.:
and pro­ posed ovx ἑώρων πω (or τοῦ) χρόνου, but discarded these suggestions for οὐκ ὄπωπ᾿ ἐγὼ χρόνου, a reading which, as Brunck truly observed, departs too widely from the MSS.
Bergk however thought that Dawes might be right as regards the ἐγὼ, and ἐγὼ is substituted for πω by Mei­ neke, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
Brunck himself suggested οὐχ ἑ ώρων διὰ χρόνου, and διὰ χρόνου is read by Green.
Meanwhile Tyrwhitt pointed out that for ἑώρακα we should read ἑόρακα, and ἑόρακα was adopted by Person, Bekker, and all subsequent editors.
See the Appendices to Birds 1573 and Thesm.
32. For πω Person suggested, though he did not read, ἀπὸ, referring to Birds 920 and 1515, but in both those passages there is a reference, which is wanting here, to the commence­ ment of the period, πω seems quite right, since Plutus is not now seeing the good after a long time ;
he does not yet see them.

only, yet all his alterations merely leave the line as it was.148.
διὰ τὸ μὴ πλουτεῖν ἴσως.
These words are intended to explain the διὰ μικρὸν ἀργυρίδιον, just for u handful of silver, of the preceding line ;
but Dobree suggested their transfer to Wealth, and Holden transfers them accordingly.
The Scholiast's gloss on δοῦλος γεγένημαι is πρότερον ὢν ἐλεύθε
ρος, meaning, quite rightly, that the expression " becoming a slave " implies that Cario was not a δοῦλος οἰκογενὴς, but had once been a freeman.
But Heimreich, mistaking these words for a quotation (which they obviously are not), proposed to substitute them for διὰ τὸ μὴ πλουτεῖν ἴσως, a strange notion (for the Scholiast means that they were implied, and therefore need not be expressed), but not too strange to be adopted by both Velsen and Van Leeuwen.162.
o μὲν γὰρ αὐτῶν P. U. and all editions before Hall and Geldart.
ό μὲν γὰρ ἡμῶν V. V2. Hall and Geldart, Van Leeuwen.

o δὲ κναΦεύει y' R. V. all editions before Brunck;
and Invernizzi and Bergk afterwards.
Brunck, however, conjectured 6 δέ τις κναΦεὑει y', and this is approved by Dobree (note to Porson's edition) and adopted by Holden.168.
που παρατίλλεται, escapes with a pinching, MSS.
vulgo, γ’οὐπαρατίλλεται (escapes a plucking) was suggested first by Bentley, and afterwards by Valckenaer, and is read by Velsen.
179.
Λαῐ MSS. vulgo.
Ναῐς, the suggestion of Athenaeus (see the Com­ mentary), is substituted for Λαῐς by Meineke, Holden, Velsen, and Van Leeu­ wen;
but as Λαῐς is read by every MS.
and recognized by every Scholiast, and was obviously the only reading known to Athenaeus himself, it is impossible to displace it.196.
ὰνὑσηται Dawes, Brunck, Person, recentiores.
ὰνὑση MSS.
editions before Brunck, but Bentley had suggested ὰνὑσηκαὶ, and Kuster ὰνυσῃ γε.197.
οὐβιωτὸν αὐτῷ Kuster, recentiores, except as hereinafter mentioned, οὐκ εἶναιβιωτὸν αὐτῷ R. V. U. the MSS.
generally, and all editions before Kuster.
Bentley proposed to strike out either εἶναι or αὐτῷ, and αὐτῷ is struck out by Bothe and Blaydes:
and also, with βιωτὸν εἶναι for εἶναι βιωτὸν, by Person, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, and Van Lecu­ wen. ὰβιωτὸν αὐτῷ P. εἶν’ ὰβιωτὸν αὐτῷ Hall and Geldart.205.
εὶς τὴν olKLav MSS. vulgo.
Bothe in his second edition suggested ὲκ τῆς οὶκίας, and this is read by Velsen and Van Leeuwen;
while Blaydes for οὐκ εἶχεν εὶς τὴν οὶκίαν οὐδὲν writes εὶς οὶκίαν οὐκ εἶχεν οὐδεὲν.216. κἃνμε δέῃ θανεῖν.
See the Com­ mentary.
The readings of the MSS.
and editions are as follows:
κᾱν SET μ’ ὰποθανεῖν R., most of the MSS., all editions, except Neobari, before Brunck, and Invernizzi afterwards.
κεὶ δεῖ μ’ ὰποθανεῖν P. U. some other MSS.
Brunck, Person, Bekker, Bothe in his second edition, and Hall and Geldart.
Brunck compares Soph.
Oed. Tyr. 669. κᾱν δῇ Neobari, Dindorf, Bothe in his first edition, Bergk, Green, Blaydes.
κᾱνχρῇ Cobet, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Van Leeuwen.
But χρῇ almost always implies a duty, or some action to be performed by the person of whom it is used.
And see Fritzsche at Frogs 264-7.
καὶ δεῖ V.217. κᾱν βοὐλῃ V. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
κᾱν βοὐλει R. Invernizzi.
It is remarkable how fre­ quently R. has an indicative or an optative with ὲάν.224.
ὲν τοῖς ὰγροῖς R. V. Fracini, GoT­ mont, Invernizzi, recentiores, except Bothe. ὲν τοῖσιν aypots P. U. all other editions before Invernizzi, and Bothe afterwards.237.
ὠς φειδωλὸν Fracini, Bentley, Person, Elmsley, Meineke, Holden, re­ centiores.
εὶς φειδωλὸν MSS. vulgo.
Kuster, recognizing that this was wrong, proposed, but did not read, εὶς φειδωλοῦ, whereon Bentley wrote to him " Corrigis εὶς φειδωλοῦ ;
Attice, fateor;
sed numer­ orum suavitatem tollit.
Sana lectio est φειδωλὸν, ut ὰπόδοσις sententiae probat, V.242 ῆν 8' εὶς παραπλῆγ’ ἃνθρωπον εὶσελθὠν τὑχω.

generally, Fracini, Kuster, recentiores. εὶς παραπλῆγ’ V. 01. O5. 07. all editions, except Fracini, before Kuster.
Kuster obtained this reading, as he did many others, from U.244.
ὲν ὰκαρεῖ χρόνῳ MSS.
vulgo.
Meineke says, " χρόνον Etym. M. apud Gaisfordum, p. 45, 26," and on the strength of that reference reads xpovov, and is followed by Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
Yet if you look to Gaisford's Etym.
M. 45, 26, you will find χρόνῳ, not χρόνον.
The fact is that some MSS. of the Etym.
M. read χρόνον, but others (which Gaisford prefers) χρόνῳ.
See the Commentary.256. παρόντ’ άμὑνειν V. F4. m. Bentley, Dawes (so quoting it p. 190), Brunck, recentiores.
παρόντας ὰμὑνειν R. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and all editions before Brunck.
Bentley had originally, in his epistle to Kuster, suggested259.
πρὶν ταῦτα καὶ MSS. vulgo.
Din­ dorf observed, wrongly in my judgement, " id est, Kal ταῦτα
πρὶν φράσαι μοι, ” taking καὶ ταῦτα in the same sense as in 272 infra.
Reiske had previously proposed to read Kal ταῦτα πρὶν, and the trans­ position is made by Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
But I think the words mean before you have even told me this.
260. μ’ ό δεσπότης ... κέκληκε SCOpo R. V. Invernizzi, Bekker, recentiores, except Bothe. γ’o δεσπότης ... κέκληκεν ήμᾱς (with slight variations) P. U. all editions except Invernizzi before Bekker, and Bothe afterwards.
267.
ψωλὸν MSS. vulgo.
χωλὸν Vel­ sen.
Herwerden ingeniously conjectures ψωρὸν, mangy, and then supposes that the Chorus, not quite hearing what Cario said, mistook ψωλὸν for σωλὸν, and so imagined that he had referred to a σωλὸν χρημάτων.
But see the Com­ mentary.
ψωρὸν is read by Van Leeu­ wen.271.
ήμᾰς ὰπαλλαγῆναι R. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo. ήμᾰς ἕπειτ’ V. (Velsen is mistaken in supposing that V. substitutes ἕπειτα for ήμᾰς).
Bergk proposed to make that substitution, and it is made by Hall and Geldart and Van Leeuwen.
Meineke reads μ’ ἕπειτ’and is followed by Holden and Velsen.
But every MS. has ήμᾰς, and there is not the slightest ground for displacing it.281.
ὅτου χάριν K.T.X.
This line has already occurred supra 260.
It is omitted in R. V. and bracketed or omitted by one or two editors.
But the sense does not seem complete without it.285.
ύμᾰς πλουσίους V. P. U. the MSS.
generally, Portus, Scaliger, Faber, Brunck, recentiores, except Invernizzi.
ήμᾰς πλουσίους R. a few other MSS., all the editions except those above men­ tioned before Brunck, and Invernizzi afterwards.286.
ήμῑν ἅπασιν V. O6. Person, Bekker, Meineke, recentiores.
ἅπασιν ήμῑν (or ἧμιν or ήμὶν) R. P. U. most of the MSS.
and all the other editions.
Brunck had, however, suggested ήμῑν ἅπασιν.287.
Μίδαις.
This was suggested by Kuster, and is read by Meineke and all subsequent editors except Green.
Μίδας MSS. vulgo.297. πινὤντα (dirty) Brunck, recen­ tiores, except Bothe and Hall and Gel­ dart.
πεινὤντα MSS. vulgo.
While this was the accepted reading Bentley pro­ posed πινοντα.301.
σφηκίσκον MSS. vulgo.
Bentley proposed σφηκίσκον, which is adopted by Meineke and Holden.
But this is quite unnecessary.
σφηκίσκ
ος is amply supported by the grammarians as signifying a sharply pointed stake.
ξύλον ὠξυμμένον, έπεὶ καὶ o σΦὴξ ὸξὐς ὲκ τῶν ὅπισθεν Scholiast, Suidas.
τὰ μικρὰ (alii μακρὰ) καὶ εὶς ὸξὐ συνηγμένα ξύλα Scholiast, Suidas, Hesychius.
And this second explanation is also given by Eustathius (on Iliad xii. 167), Etym. Magn. (s.v. σφῆκες) and Photius (s.vv. σφῆκες καὶ σφηκιαί).
Photius says that the word was so used by Pherecrates, a circumstance which disposes of Bent­ ley's suggestion that the grammarians were misled by the present passage.
The participle ήμμένον before σφηκίσκον is omitted by R. V. but is found in all printed editions.318.
ὶὠν ἤδη MSS. vulgo.
Bamberg proposed ίὠν εἲσω referring to Knights 1110 (-where some MSS.
have ἤδη and others εἲσω), and this is adopted by Velsen and Van Leeuwen.
But here all the MSS.
have ἤδη.327.
ὅντωςR. P. and (as corrected) U. most MSS. Junta to Gelenius (inclusive), Brunck, recentiores.
ὅντες V. and (ori­ ginally) U. Aldus, Rapheleng, and sub­ sequent editions before Brunck.329.
εἲνεκαR. V. and all editions, except Junta, before Brunck, and Invernizzi, Bekker, Bergk, and Blaydes afterwards, οὔνεκα P. U. Junta, Brunck, and (save as aforesaid) recentiores.
338.
έπὶ MSS. (except l1.) and vulgo. ὲν l1. Cobet, Meineke, Velsen, Van Leeu­ wen.
The two latter editors ascribe the alteration to Person, but this is a mistake.
340.
θαυμάσιον V. Pierson, Brunck, Poison, recentiores.
θαυμαστὸν R. P. U. all editions before Brunck, and Inver­ nizzi afterwards.
But in order to pre­ serve the metre most of the early editors add χ’after θαυμαστὸν which Brunck altered to y' and so Invernizzi.
In Porson's text the words are transposed θαυμαστὸν αὐτὸ τοῡθ’, but in his note he prefers θαυμάσιον which has since been found in V.342. γε πρᾱγμ’ V. Porson, Bekker, recentiores, except Bothe. ye τι πρᾱγμ’ R. P. Invernizzi, Bothe. γε τὸ πρᾱγμ’ U. τι πρᾱγμ’ editions before Person, and Bothe afterwards.343.
νὴ τοὐς θεούς R. V. Dindorf, recentiores, except Bothe. μὰ τοὐςθεούς P. U. editions before Dindorf, and Bothe afterwards.
Several editors connect the words with the following line, as if they were an assent to something which Blepsidemus had said;
but he has not yet spoken to Chremylus.
354. τό T' αὗV. P. U. vulgo. τότε δ’ αὗ R. TO 8' αὗΒergk.361.
τοιοῡτο ;
BA. φεῡ V. P. U. several other MSS.
and all editions (except Porson) before Bergk.
τοιοῡτον. BA. φεῡ R. and several other MSS.
τοιουτονί with φεῡ extra metrum Elmsley at Oed. Tyr. 734 (Oxford, 1811), Person, Bergk, recentiores.365. εἶχεν.
The v was added by Brunck.
εἶχεV. P. U. all editions before Brunck.
εἶχεςR. Invernizzi.
But (except for Invernizzi) Brunck's reading is followed by all subsequent editors.367.
ἕχει P. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
ἕχεις R. V. Invernizzi.
V. in the margin gives a variant μένει,and this is adopted by Velsen and Van Leeuwen.368.
τι πεπονουργηκότος.
This was pro­ posed by Boissonade and Valckenaer, and is read by Bothe and Van Leeuwen.
τι πεπανουργηκότι MSS. vulgo.
τι πεπα­ νοὐργηχ’ ὄτιΒergk, Velsen.
τίπεπανοὐρ­ γηχ’. XP. ὂτι;
Rutherford, ὂτι πεπα­ νούργηκέ τι Meineke, Holden.
Van Leeu­ wen changes ἐστὶν into ἔστ’ and inserts ὥς after ἐπίδηλ
ον.
The Scholiast ex­ plains ἐπίδλον by ὄμοιον and says that πεπανουργηκότι is used for πεπανουργηκότος, but ἐπίδηλον cannot possibly bear the meaning assigned, and there is no sense in using the genitive for the dative, when either case will suit the metre equally well.
The meaning is His look is plainly that of a man who has done wrong.
369. σὺ MSS. vulgo.
Elmsley (at Ach. 255) observed " Malim etiam in Plut. 369 σὲ μὲν οἶδ’ ô κρώζεις,” and accordingly Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes change σὺ into σὲ.374.
ποî τις α̑ν Kuster, recentiores.
So Dawes on line 438 of this play.
TrOiL τις οὖν MSS.
(except P. which has ποȋ περ οὖν) all editions before Kuster.375.
ἐθέλεις R. V. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
A. few MSS.
have ἐθέλει Dobree (note to Porson) observed " ἐθελει E, quod per se non malum sed finales alibi omittit iste codex," and on this very guarded observation Dobree is claimed as an authority for changing ἐθέλεις into ἐθέλει, and his supposed authority is followed by Meineke, Velsen, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.380.
φίλως R. P. U. most MSS.
Brunck, recentiores.
φίλος V. many MSS., and all editions before Brunck.400.
οὐ τῷ μεταδου̑ναι j MSS.
vulgo.
Kappeyne, altering οὺ into ἐν, gave the whole of this verse, except the final τί, to Chremylus;
and this, with the sub­ stitution of a comma for the note of interrogation, was approved by Bamberg, and adopted by Velsen.
Both Bentley and Person proposed τῳ for τῷ.
Butthe MS.
reading is perfectly satisfactory.406.
εἰσαγαεȋν R. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
εἰσάγειν V. V2. Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.408.
οὐδἐν ἒστ’ (variously accented) MSS.
vulgo.
Bentley suggested οὐδέν’ eor, and Bergk reads οὐδὲν ἒτ’ ἒστ’.414.
καὶ δὴ βαδίζω V. P. U. most MSS. all editions before Invernizzi, and all editions after Green.
καὶ μὴν βαδίζω R. all editions from Invernizzi to Green inclusive.
The δὴ seems clearly right:
it has a sort of demonstrative effect.
Here I am going, as you can see.
Of. supra 227.417. τίφεύγετον MSS. vulgo. τί φεύγετ’ Gelenius, Person, Dindorf, Bergk, Mei­ neke, Holden, Green, Blaydes.
There seems no reason and no authority for this change.422.
ὠχρὰ μὲν yap MSS.
(except that V. P. omit the μὲν and U. the -yap) vulgo.
Velsen (in Symbol.
Philol.
Bonn, I. p. 413) proposed to alter μὲν yap into μαινὰς, and Bamberg, approving this, added the further suggestion that ὠχρὰ should be changed into ὠ ypav.
And this double departure from the MSS.
is introduced into the text by Velsen.423.
’Ερινύς R. V. Bekker, Dindorf, recentiores, except Bothe.
’Εριννύς P. U. editions before Bekker, and Bothe afterwards.431.
τὸ βάροθρόν σοι R. U. (but in U. the σοι is superscriptum) Bekker, Din­ dorf, and almost all subsequent editors.
σοι τὸ βάραθρον V. P. all editions before Bekker, and one or two since.438.
ποî τις φύγη ;
R. V. V2. W1 W2.
Dawes, Brunck, recentiores.
not τις φύγοι ;
P. U. most MSS. and all editions before Brunck.
It was in his comment on this line that Dawes enunciated his well-known canon, "Optativum cum ποî, πόθεν, που̑, πω̑ς vel qualibet alia inter­ rogandi particula coniunctum α̑ν exigit;
subiunctivum vero respuit."
The line was originally omitted in R. but is added in the margin :
and the letter η is much scribbled over.
Velsen thinks it was first ει, then οι, and finally η.
There is no doubt about the final η.439.
δειλότατον σὺ θηρίον MSS.
and all editions except Blaydes who changes θηρίον into θηρίων, as in Birds 87.
But the unanimity of the MSS.
here makes it doubtful whether we should not read θηρίον there.445.
δειλότατον P4. 03. δεινότατον the other MSS.
and all editions.
But δειλό­ τατον seems certainly right.
It is a question of deLta.
And a δεινὸν ἒργον is quite a different matter.
Of. Ach. 128, Birds 1175, supra 429, infra 455.446. ἐργασόμεθ’ εἰ, and in the next line ὰπολιπόντε ποι MSS.
vulgo.
Dobree observed Vide an legendum ἐργασο­ μένωτὸν et ἀπολιπόντες εἰ.’’
There seems no reason whatever for this suggestion, but Velsen, leaving ἐργασόμεθα, reads ἀπολιπόντες εἰ accordingly ;
and has therefore, alone of all editors, to follow V. in reading δεδιότες in the following line where all the other MSS.
and editions have δεδιότε.453.
α̑ν στήσοιτο R. V. and many MSS. (but R. seems to unite the words)
Bent ley, Kuster, Brunck, recentiores.
ἀνα­ στήσαιτο P. U. some other MSS.
and all editions before Kuster.461, 462.
ἀνθμώ οισιν ἐκπορίζομεν ἀγα­ θόν.
lIEN.
Tt 8' ἂν ὑμεȋς R. P. and (except that for ἐκπορίζομεν it has ἐκποριζοίμεθ’) V. many other MSS.
Person, recentiores, except Velsen.
But in the MSS.
ἀγαθὸν is annexed to line 461, and in order apparently to make that line scan, U. writes ἀνθρώποις πορίζομεν leaving 462 unmetrical and mutilated.
And so all editions before Brunck, with the ex­ ception of Junta and Gormont who have ἀνθρώποισι πορίζομεν.
And all begin the second line with τί δ’ ἂν γ’ὑμεîς.
While matters were in this unsatisfactory state Bentley restored the metre by proposing ὺνθρώποις ὰγοθὸν (or ἀγαθὰ) πορίζομεν. ΠΕΝ. τί δη̑τ’ ἂν ὑμεîς.
And this, with ἀγαθὸν, is adopted by Brunck (in his note) and Invernizzi.
Porson was how­ ever the first to see that ἀγαθὸν belongs to line 462, and to reconstruct the passage in accordance with what is now found to be the reading of the best MSS.
And it is surprising that after the true reading is known, Velsen should hark back to Bentley's stopgap, with ἀγαθὰ, in 461;
while in 462, pro­ fessing still to follow Bentley, he, by mistake, adopts not Bentley's reading but that of O3. τί δίδ’ ἂν ποθ’ which, as Brunck observed, is very inferior to Bentley's.465.
ἀνθρώποις R. V. several other MSS.
Invernizzi, Bergk, Velsen.
ἀνθρώ­ πους P. U. some other MSS. and vulgo.
ἀνθρώποις is clearly right.
κακὸν ἀνθρώποις here is the retort to ἀνθρώποισιν ἀγαθὸν four lines above.476.
& τύμπανα καὶ MSS. vulgo. " Non sollicito," says Bentley, " suavius tamen esset ὦτύμπαν’ ὦ.’’
Velsen, throwing Bentley's caution to the winds, foists his suggestion into the text.
For my own part, I prefer the MS.
reading.482. αὐτό y, ἐὰν P. the MSS.

Bisschop (at Xen. Anab. p. 94) proposed to read τί ἂν ἐξεύρ
οι τις, which (with οὐδὲν for οὔτις in the following line) seems by no means improbable, and is adopted by Van Leeuwen.
Bamberg (p. 9) adopts Bisschop’s alteration except that he would leave the MS.
ποτ’ un­ changed ;
this seems less probable, but is adopted by Holden and Velsen.
The reference to Bisschop is ascribed to Dindorf, but I do not know where it was made.499.

but Bentley observed that the metre could be recti­ fied by omitting σοι, and this is done by Dindorf and Bergk.
οὔτις ἂν Portus to Kuster, but Kuster in his note struck out the av.
οὐδὲν is of course read by those who adopt the suggestion of Biss­ chop or Bamberg on the preceding line.
And Meineke also reads οὐδὲν, changing τίς in the preceding line into τὶς.
Hall and Geldart read οὐδεὶς, transposing the four words which follow into τούτου μάρτυς ἐγὡ σοι.
Bentley, though he at first inclined to οὐδεὶς ἂν, omitting σοι, afterwards came round to the common reading which is given in the text.505.

But this does not mean that φιδάκνη was the common usage of Attic writers.
Far from it.
See the Appendix on Birds 48, and the Fourth Additional Note to that Comedy.
The great Attic writers, with the possible exception of Plato, far preferred the general Hellenic forms to their own native provincialisms.
And this was especially the case with the dramatists, whose works were exhibited, at the Great Dionysia, before an audience comprising visitors from all friendly Hellenic peoples.548.
ὑπεκρούσω MSS. vulgo.
Pollux (ix. 139) says 'Αριστοφάνης ἐν Πλούτῳ καὶ τῷ ἐπικρούσασθαι ἐπὶ του̑ νουθετη̑σαι κέχρη­ ται, where Jungermann suggested that ἐπεκρούσω might be the right reading here, and this view is adopted by Mei­ neke, Holden, Velsen, and Van Leeuwen.
But the explanation which Pollux gives does not suit the present passage.550.

φάτ᾽ εἶναι ὅμοιον R. V. P. and the MSS.

φάθ᾽ ὅμοιον Fracini, Gelenius.
The φάτε no doubt crept in from the φάμεν of the preceding verse.
Fritzsche (Quaest. Aristoph. p. 236) pro­ posed to read φάθ᾽ ὅμοιον τὸν Διόνυσον.562.

The line, as given in the text, is read by P. U. F4. C2. Hemsterhuys, Brunck, Bothe, Bekker. νὴ τὸν

The line is omitted, bracketed, or obelized by Person and (save as afore­ said) all subsequent editors.
But see the Commentary.573.

ἀναπείσεις P.580.
ταύτην δ᾽ ἡμῖν ἀποπέμπει.
These words are continued to Chremylus in the MSS.
and all editions before Brunck.
They were transferred to Blepsidemus by Bentley, who is followed by Brunck and all subsequent editors.581.
λήμαις R. V. P. U. Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
But V. has in the margin yp. γνώμαις, and this is read in a few other MSS.
and all editions before Brunck.583.
τὸν 'Ολυμπικὸν atros.
This was suggested by Kuster in his notes, and is read by Brunck and all subsequent editors except Blaydes.
It is said to have been since found in O. and a few other MSS.
αὐτὸς τὸν ᾽Ολυμπικὸν R. V. αὐτὸς τὸν ᾽Ολυμπιακὸν most MSS.

τὸν ᾽Ολυμπιακὸν αὐτὸς P. U. Bentley suggested αὐτὸς τὸν ᾽Ολύμπι᾽, which Blaydes, making and rejecting eight conjectures of his own, brings into the text.585.

While this was the received reading, Bentley suggested the substitu­ tion either of ἀποπέμπειν or προσάξειν for προσάγειν.
Tyrwhitt proposed to transpose the words προσάγειν κατὰ μῆνα, and this is done by Bergk.
For ἀπο­ πέμπειν, προσπέμπειν is read by U. and προσπέμπειν by P14.

Of course either the dual or plural would do;
but the dual makes the line more euphonious.
660.
προθύματαΜSS. vulgo.
The Scholiast mentions a variant θυλήματα which is brought into the text by Bergk and Meineke.
666.
ύπερηκόντισεν R. U. the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
ύπερηκόντικεν V. P. and a corrector of R. Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
But Cario is not speaking of some isolated act;
and Blaydes in his note sees that the aorist is right.
669. πορήγγειλεν καθεύδειν R. P. 0. and many other MSS.
Kuster, recentiores, except as hereinafter appears.
παρήγ­ γειλε καθεύδειν V. U. all editions before Kuster.
παρήγγειλ᾽ ἐγκαθεύδειν Person, Bothe, and Bergk to Blaydes.
But I cannot see what force can be attributed to the compound ἐγκαθεύδειν.673.
ἀθάρης.
The word occurs thrice:
here and in lines 683 and 694.
In each case every printed edition, except Bergk's, reads ἀθάρης and not ἀθάρας.
The Scholiast says 'Αττικοὶ διὰ τοῦ η, ἀθάρης.
ἡ δὲ κοινὴ διὰ τοῦ a, ἀθάρας.
The MSS.
are very equally divided.
Of the four collated by Velsen, U. has ἀθάρης throughout.
R. has ἀθάρας in 673 and 694, and ἀθάρης in 683.
V. and P. have ἀθάρας throughout.681.
ἥγιζεν P. U. vulgo.
ᾐτιζεν R. ἥκιζεν V. ἥλιζεν Blaydes.
See the Com­ mentary.684.
ἐδεδοίκεις MSS. vulgo.
ἐδεδοίκης Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.689. τὴν χεῖρ᾽ ὑφῆκε.
See the Com­ mentary.
τὴν χεῖρ᾽ ὑφᾐρει MSS. vulgo. τῇ χεῖρ᾽ ὑφᾐρει Brunck, Invernizzi.
τὴν χεῖρ᾽ ὑπῇρε Hemsterhuys, Van Leeuwen.
τὴν χεῖρ᾽ ὑπερῆρε Bergk.
Dobree sug­ gested that the Scholiast may have read ἄρασ᾽ ὑφῄρει, id est ἄρασα τὴν χεῖρα ὑφῄρει τὴν χύτραν.
He did not suggest that ἄρασ᾽ ύφᾐρει should be introduced into the text;
but it is so introduced by Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.695.
ἀνεπαυόμην U. vulgo.
ἀνεπαλλόμην (but with ἀνεπαυόμην in the margin) R. V. Bergk.
P. omits the line.696. προσῄειν V. most MSS. and vulgo.
προσῄει γ᾽ R. Invernizzi.
προσῄει P. U. and several other MSS.701.
᾽Ιασὼ μέν τις ἀκολουθοῦσ᾽ P. U. P8. P14. F4. O.O5. O6. 07. and all editions ex­ cept the four presently mentioned.
For μέν τις R. has μέν ye τις, and so Inver­ nizzi and Bamberg.
V. is said to have μέν γε without τις, but I cannot be sure of its reading myself.
Reisig suggested μέν γ᾽ ἐπακολουθοῦσ᾽ which is read by Bergk, Meineke, and Van Leeuwen.
Herwerden suggests μἐν παρακολουθοῦσ᾽.
Dr. Blaydes is ready with five conjec­ tures "᾽Ιασὼ μάντις, vel ᾽Ιασὼ κατόπιν, vel ᾽Ιασὼ πρόπολος, vel ᾽Ιασώ τ᾽ ἐγγὺς, vel ᾽Ιatria τις συνακολουθοῦσ᾽" if any one would like to adopt them.
He does not adopt any of them himself.
The τις is indicative of a contemptuous feeling, a girl named Iaso.707.
ἐνεκαλυψάμην R. V. 0. Bentley, Dawes, Brunck, recentiores.
συνεκαλυ­ ψάμην P. U. most MSS. and all editions before Brunck.
Dawes says "
Fefellit in hoc versu cum editores turn etiam Scaligerum et Bentleium dactylus in quarta sede collocatus."
But he was acquainted with Bentley's Epistle to Kuster only ;
and when Bentley's notes in the margin of his Gelenius were dis­ covered, it was seen that the difficulty had not escaped his notice, and that he had in fact anticipated the emenda­ tion suggested by Dawes.712.
ry. λίθινον;
K.T.X.
This line is omitted in R. doubtless from an over­ sight occasioned by its ending with the same word as the preceding line ;
a very common cause of omission;
and one which gives no ground for suspecting the genuineness of the omitted line.
See on 833 infra.725.
νν'ὺπομνύμενον. The MSS.
have έπομνύμενον, and that is the common reading here, but some of the Scholiast's observations point strongly to ὑπομνύ­ μενον, which was adopted by Girard nearly 400 years ago.
His note is as follows "
Significat hoc verbum aliquo praetextu, puta peregrinationis vel morbi, causam in aliud tempus reiicere.
Hoc ait Aesculapius, si in concionem venire non potes, ubi tu oraturus eras, liberabo te, et guominus illic sis, faxo ut omnes intelligant dignum esse te qui iure iurando dilationem postules et impetres."
This reading is strongly supported by Brunck, Dob re e, and Bergk, and is adopted by Meineke and all subsequent editors.
έπομνύμενον by an oversight is written έπωμνύμενον by Gelenius, Portus, and one or two others.— τη̑ς έκκλησίας P. most of the MSS.
and all the editions except as hereinafter mentioned, ray έκκλησίας R. V. U. Bekker, Hall and Geldart.
Bergk suggested ταἱς έκκλη­ σίαις which is read by Meineke, Holden, Velsen, and Van Leeuwen.
This read­ ing is attributed to the Scholiast, but apparently without any reason.729.
ἡμιτύβιον VI. P3. P14. and a few other MSS.
and all printed editions except Invernizzi.
ἡμιτύμβιον R. V. P. U. the MSS.
generally, and Invernizzi.746.
ὂτι πεινΜSS.
vulgo.
Bentley suggested ότιὴ βλέπειν which Blaydes reads.754. ὂσοιδ' R. V. vulgo. ὂσοιτ' P. U. and the MSS.
generally.765.
κριβανωτω̑ν όρμαθῷ R. V3. F2. Invernizzi, Bekker, recentiores, except Bothe. έν κριβανωτω̑ν όρμαθῷ V. P. U. the MSS.
generally, all editions before Bekker except Junta and Invernizzi, and Bothe afterwards.
But in V. the έν was corrected into ὲκ, and this is read by Junta.
έν κριβανωτῷ όρμαθῷ P2. P5. έν τω̑ν όρμαθω̑ν P3. Both Hem­ sterhuys and Brunck, though retaining the reading έν κριβανωτω̑ν όρμαθῷ, were minded to omit the έν.
κριβανιτω̑ν is the more common form, and Elmsley (at Ach. 1123) was inclined to recom­ mend it here;
and it is accordingly adopted by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.
This is very possibly right;
but all the numerous MSS.
of this play have a in the penultimate syllable, and both forms may well have been in use.767.
ἂνδρες.
The aspirate was added by Person.769.
έγώ MSS. (except O3.
which omits the word) vulgo.
The position of έγὼ at the end of the line has given rise to some suspicion.
Hemsterhuys thought that it might have been in­ serted to fill the lacuna left by the omission of some other word ;
which might have been, Dobree suggests, πρέπει, νόμος, or (with ὀφθαλμοίσι) δεί or χρή•Velsen reads χρεὼν, and is followed by Van Leeuwen.
But see the Commentary.770.
ὑπαντη̑σαι M. m. m1. 05. O8. CS. Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Van Leeuwen.
ἀπαντη̑σαι the other MSS.
and vulgo.
It seems far more probable that ὑπαντη̑­ σαι should have been corrupted into ἀπαντη̑σαι, than vice versa.
After this line R. and V. have KOMMATION XOPOY ;
R. as part of the original text V. as an afterthought.
And so all editions before Kuster and one or two since.
Brunck has λείπει κομμάτιον του̑ Χορου̑, and one or two editors have XOPOY simply, whilst Velsen writes ὂρχημα χορου̑.
But most editors have followed Kuster in omitting the words altogether;
and as it seems certain that there was no Choral song here, and that therefore nothing has dropped out of the text, this seems the right course.
Between the other scenes the best MSS.
have nothing of this sort;
and the editors insert or omit the notice there as they do here.779.
αὺτὰ πάντα MSS. vulgo.
αὖτὰ πόντα Bentley, Hemsterhuys, Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Velsen.
But I can­ not agree with Bentley that αύτὰ is superfluous.
Wealth does not mean "
I will reverse everything he means "
I will reverse all that.
"781. ένεδίδουν R. P. U. the MSS.
gener­ ally, and vulgo.
έπεδίδουν V. V2. Bergk, recentiores, except Green.
This is because Aristophanes uses the compound έπιδίδωμι in Thesm.
213, 217, 249.
But one verb is just as apt as the other, and the MS.
authority is overwhelming.
Dr. Blaydes himself quotes from Plut­ arch, Alcibiades, chap. 6 τοϊς κόλαξιν ένδιδοὺς έαυτὸν, and from Lucian, Calum­ niae 22 έκόντος έαυτὸν ἐνδιδόντος.
To which may be added Plato, Rep. viii.
chap. xiii. 561 B ;
Phaedrus, chap. xviii. 241 C (where the MSS.
have ἐνδου̑ναι, ἐπιδου̑ναι, which some read, being a mere conjecture of Hirschig).783. οἱ φαινόμενοι.
The ingenious conjecture of Hemsterhuys όσφραινό­ μενοι is deserving of mention, though it cannot be adopted.785.
ἐνδεικνύμενος R. V. many other MSS.
Person, Bothe, Bekker, recentiores.
ἐνδεικνύμενοι P. U. many other MSS.
and all editions before Person.788.

generally, and vulgo.
χαίρετον a few MSS.
Brunck, Person, Bothe, Dindorf, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.801. τὰς δαςΜSS. vulgo.
Suidas (s. v. ἰσχὰς) citing this line from memory writes (according to a majority of his MSS.)
τω̑ν ἰσχάδων, and this is introduced into the text of Aristophanes by Mei­ neke, Holden, Velsen, and Van Leeuwen.
But to say that Dexinicus wished to get a share of the figs would not impute to him any special greed;
that would be the wish of the spectators at large;
Dexinicus is described as wishing to get the figs generally.
After this line the MSS.
make no mention of any choral intervention except that C1. and a cor­ rector of R. write Xopov.
But Aldus and all editions (except Fracini and Gelenius) before Portus have Χορυ̑ in the margin;
whilst Fracini, Gelenius, Portus, the editions called Scaliger's and Faber's, and Person, place it between lines 801 and 802.
Kuster omitted it, and of more recent editors some insert, but most omit it.
Brunck and Velsen read as they did after line 770 supra.805 a. οῠτω τὸ πλουτεΐν K.T.X.
This line is found in the MSS.
but was adjudged to be spurious by Bentley, and is omitted or bracketed by Brunck and most recent editors.
In U. P2. P3. P5. the letters yv or γνω are prefixed.
Brunck considered, and I think rightly, that the line was originally written in the margin as a parallel passage to line 802;
and having access to the last three MSS.
mentioned, he observed that the copyist had brought in not merely the line, but also its title, γνώμη.
Van Leeuwen places it between lines 818 and 819, which is certainly a more suitable position.
The last word is given as δὴ by R. V. Invernizzi and most of the more recent editors ;
as τι by P. U. and most of the MSS.
and by all editors before Invernizzi.813.
σαπροὺς MSS. vulgo.
Kuster suggested σαθροὺς which is read by Meineke and Velsen.815.
o §' ίπνὸς γέγον' ὴμἰν R. V. V2. Dawes, Invernizzi, Person, Bekker, recentiores, except Bothe and Velsen. o 8' ίπνὸς ήμἲν P. U. the MSS.
generally, and all editions before Brunck.
Had the first syllable of ἰπνὸς been long, this would have been quite right;
but un­ fortunately it is short.
Bentley there­ fore, referring to Pollux (x. 155) who writes 'Αριστοφάνης έν Πλούτῳ εἰπὸν τὴν μυάγραν καλεȋ, proposed to read ἶπος here, and this is strongly supported by Brunck who inserts ἶπος in the text, and is followed by Bothe and Velsen.
On the other hand Dawes, finding the line quoted by Athenaeus (vi. chap. 16) as ό δ' ἰπνὸς γέγονεν, proposed to read ό S' ἰπνὸς γέγον'ήμΐν.
This proposal was vigorously attacked by Brunck who says " Virum ingeniosum abripiebat livor et Bentleii laudum obtrectatio."
It would have been very difficult to decide between the proposals of Bentley and Dawes on their own merits.
But when the two great Aristophanic MSS.
in the libraries of Ravenna and Venice were brought to light, they were both found to have ό δ' ίπνὸς γέγον' ὴμȋν, and the question was finally set at rest.824.
KAP.
The speaker who carries on the conversation with the Good Man is said to be Cario (under his own name, or as οἰκέτηςοr θεράπων) by R. V. U. many other MSS.
all editions before Brunck, and all editions after Bothe's second.
But P. many other MSS.
and the editions from Brunck to Bothe's second (inclusive) give his part to Chremylus, and this change is strongly recommended by Hemsterhuys.
But the preceding speech was certainly spoken by Cario, and there is no sign of his having left the stage, or of Chremy­ lus having come on it.826.
δη̑λον ὅτι R. P. vulgo.
δηλονότι V. U. Brunck.
Meineke proposed to make δη̑λον ὅτι a complete sentence, unconnected with what follows;
and this is done by Holden and Velsen.833.
κομιδη̑ μὲν ούν.
This line is omitted by B. no doubt because it com­ mences with the same words as the next.
See on 712 supra.834.
τέως R. P. U. the MSS.

8' R. Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk to Green, and Hall and Geldart.
But this seems hardly Greek.
καὶ κατε­ γέλων U.839. αὺχμὸς.
This line is in the MSS.
and vulgo rightly continued to the Good Man.
Meineke transfers it to Cario, changing μ'άπώλεσεν into σ' ἀπώ­ λεσεν.
And this unnecessary alteration is followed by Holden, Velsen, and Green.840. ἀλλ' οὐχὶ νυ̑ν.
These words are given to Cario by R. V. and vulgo, but are transferred to the Good Man by Bergk to Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.
842.
πρὸς τω̑ν θεω̑ν R. V. P. U. and the MSS.
generally, and vulgo.
πρὸς top θεὸν quid facit ad deum ?
Hemster­ huys (and the reading is supported by a few insignificant MSS.), Brunck to Bergk, and Velsen.
Hemsterhuys's read­ ing is very attractive, but it seems unsafe to depart from the practically unanimous authority of the MSS.843.
μετὰ σ
ου̑ TO παιδάριον MSS.
vulgo.
Meineke suggested, but did not read τὸ μετὰ σου̑̑ παιδάριον, a curious suggestion, but it is adopted by Velsen and Van Leeuwen.845.
μω̑ν ένεμυήθης R. C2. Person, Bothe, Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, Holden, Green, and Blaydes;
a reading, says Dobree, " quod vel ex coniectura re­ ponendum esset."

μω̑ν έμυήθης V.847.
συνεχειμάζετο MSS. vulgo. " Re­ pono confidenter συνεχείμαζέ μοι. Of. Av. 1097."— Blaydes.
But, as Van Leeuwen observes, χειμάζειν in the Birds means merely hiemem transigere:
the meaning here required is hieme vexari.851.
τρισκακοδαίμων MSS.
all editions before Person, and Blaydes and Van Leeuwen afterwards, τρὶς κακοδαίμων Porson, recentiores, except as aforesaid.
There seems no sufficient ground for departing from the MSS.
The τρὶς starts the enumeration, τετράκις, πεντάκις, &c., just as well from the compound, as if it stood alone.
In the MSS.
the Informer is called usually Συκοφάντης, but occasionally "Αδικος in contrast to Δίκαιος.856.
νυνὶπράγματα MSS. vulgo.
Mei­ neke in his Vind.
Aristoph.
proposes to write νυνὶ, χρήματα referring to 871 infra;

Fritzsche was the first to point out the true meaning of this line ;
and before his time, and indeed afterwards also, there have been numerous proposals to alter the words.
Dawes conjectured aXX' οὑ περίεσται. Hemsterhuys aXX' οὑκ ἂν ἒσται, and this strange reading is introduced into the text by Brunck and Invernizzi.
" Hotibius " ἀλλ' οὐκὸνέξει1. Madvig ἀλλ' οὐκ ἂκος ἒστι.
Holden aXX' οὐκ ἐπῳδὴ or ἲασις.
Velsen not only conjectures, but reads φάρμακα
8' ἒνεστι with a note of interrogation at the end of the line;
whilst Van Leeuwen sub­ stitutes φάρμακον for δήγματος. The MS.
reading, when rightly understood, is incomparably superior to all these con­ jectures.895.
ὖ ὗ κ.τ.λ. R. P. U. repeat the υ twelve times which is manifestly right, as the line is intended for an iambic trimeter.
In the translation there have to be only ten repetitions.
Bothe (in the text) has only eight, but all other printed editions give the full twelve.
V. has fifteen.
As to the accent the MSS.
give none, and it seems rather absurd to place an accent on a sniff.
But it is accented in all the editions.
Aldus accented it ὖὗ and this was continued till Brunck's time.
But Bentley observing that the double v should form an iamb suggested ὗ ὗand this is adopted by Brunck and subsequent editors.
897.
τοιου̑τόν γ' ἀμπέχεται R. P. U. the MSS.

Haec ad eum conversus, quem adhuc adstare sibi credebat, testem dicit;
nunc aptum Carionis responsum;
alioquin scribi debuerat, ̋Ορα γ’ a ποιεȋς vide quid agas:
cave ne me vocante in ius tibi sit ambu­ landum.
Sed illud quod proposui verum est, et, ut iam primum video, ab inter­ prete Frischlino animadversum."
Fris­ chlin, who had turned this Comedy into Latin verse, gave for this line Viden' quid agat ?
nam horum te testem mihi voco.
There is no more judicious com­ mentator than Hemsterhuys, but I cannot bring myself to think that he is right in making this alteration.
The appeal μαρτὺρομαι or ταυ̑τ ἐγὼ μαρτύρομαι is frequently found in these comedies, and in no single instance is it prefaced by any preliminary remarks to the person or persons addressed.
It is always in the nature of an ejaculation, wrung from the speaker by the stress of the moment.
See Clouds 1297, Wasps, 1436 Frogs 528, &c.
It seems to me that the Informer, stripped of his cloke and shoes says first to Cario
Do you see what you are doing?
and then, as Cario pays no attention, appeals to his witness in the usual form.933.

ἔπειτα πλουτῶν MSS. vulgo.
ἔπειτα seems to me the very word re­ quired, and I do not know why so many critics have sought to change it.
Kuster suggested ἐπεί γε ;
Dobree εἴπερ γε ;
Bergk ἐπίμεστα (this is from Phrynichus Bekkeri p. 40 ἐπίμεστα πλουτῶν’ οἶον ὑπερβάλλοντι τῷ μέτρω̩, ἁντὶ του̑, πάνυ πλουτῶν.
But it makes no sense here);
and Blaydes "ra νυ̑ν δὲ, vel ἅφνω δὲ, vel ἀνὴρ δὲ, vel potius ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐπλοὐτησ’, vel νυνὶ δὲ.”
But the only editor who has tampered with the text is Meineke, who not only conjectures, but actually reads ἐπεὶ ζαπλουτῶν.1005. ἅπαντ’ ἐπήσθιεν Athenaeus (iv. chap. 69) who cites this line as an ex­ ample of the use of ἐπεσθίειν, and so Brunck and all subsequent editors ex­ cept as hereinafter mentioned, ἅπαντα κατήσθιεν P. U. other MSS.
and all editions before Brunck:

νηττάριον ... φάττιον.
These are Bentley's emendations for the meaning­ less νιτάριον and βάτιον of the MSS.
and early editions.
I regret that his masterly discussion of the passage (in his Epistle to Kuster) is too long to be reproduced here.
He refers to Plautus, Asinaria iii.
3. 103 Die igitur me anaticulam, columbulam, &c., where no doubt in the ’Οναγὸς of Demophilus, which Plautus is adapting, the words were, as here, νηττάριον and φάττιον.
Faber had already (at Lucret. p. 497) suggested νησσάριον for νιτάριον.
Bentley's emenda­ tion is adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, and Hall and Geldart, and would have been followed by all editors, were it not for a doubt whether a tribrach, followed by an anapaest, is admissible in a Comic senarius.
But although such a conjunction is rare, it is by no means unknown in Aristo- phones;
Ach. 47, Birds 108, Eccl. 315, &c., and this little repetition of pet names is the very place in which a seeming irregularity is permissible.
Compare Frogs 1203.
However, Person and Blaydes have νηττάριον ὑπεκορίζετ’ av Kai φάττιον, an alteration which really destroys the charm of the verse;
Bothe and Bergk read νηττάριον and βάτιον, though Bentley had clearly shown βάτιον to be impossible;
Bergk himself suggested βάβιον, a baby ;
while Meineke reads φάβιον, and is followed by Holden, Velsen, Green, and Van Leeuwen.
But although the φὰψ is no doubt another name for the φάττα, Aristophanes never used the form φὰψ, and no one ever used the diminutive φάβιον ;
whilst φάττα is constantly used by Aristophanes (Ach. 1105,1107, Peace 1004, Birds 303) and the diminutive φάττιον is found in some lines quoted by Athenaeus (viii. chap. 58) from the comic poet Ephippus, ἀλεκτρυόνιον, φάτ­ τιον, περδίκιον.
Moreover, as Bentley observed, the words νήττας and φάττας are in the Peace placed in juxta­ position.1012.

According to Velsen, R. had originally ἤ̩τησ’ which is corrected into ἤ̩τει σ’ (but in the facsimile it is difficult to distinguish the original and corrected readings).

Brunck's emendation, which he supports by referring to Clouds 1283, 1434, and other passages, seems neces­ sary.

Kuster (on Suid. iii. p. 128) suggested ἀπὸ, and this was approved by Person (though he did not insert it in his text), and is read by Bothe and Meineke.
But it over­ looks the jest in the word ἐτῶν, which seems the chief point of the speech.
Dr. Rutherford would read ὑπὸ χιλίων ye τῶνδε καὶ τρισμυρίων, but this not merely destroys the jest, but ignores the indefinite "thirteen."

But Pollux merely means that Attic writers preferred to write μουσικῆς, which is quite accurate;
while abundant instances are cited by Hemsterhuys, Person, and Dobree to show that the form which Aristophanes employs was also in common use with the best writers.
Both forms are em­ ployed by Thucydides in the same chapter (iii. 104);
by Plutarch in the same chapter (Pericles chap. xiii), by Plato in various treatises, Menexenus chap. 21, Laws ii. 658 A, viii. 828 C, and by other writers.1173.

Blaydes on the other hand reads o θεὸς οὗτος, and is followed by Van Leeuwen.
But the MS.
reading seems superior to all these suggestions, οὗτος is a sort of echo of Πλοῦτος, and is used in disparage­ ment of “this Wealth " whom the Priest of Zεὺς Σωτὴρ,as he presently proclaims himself to be, does not even recognize as a real God.1182.

And as this dis­ tinction is borne out by the best MSS.
here, it seems right to follow them.1199. ἔχουσα 6' R. V. P. the MSS.
generally and vulgo.
ἔχουσά γ’U.
To give the English reader a clear idea of the difference between the New Comedy which Aristophanes inaugurated in the Cocalus, and the Old Attic Comedy represented in these volumes, it seems desirable to add here a translation of one of the Plautine comedies, itself an adaptation from the Greek.
For this purpose the Menaechmi has been selected, partly for its own merits, and partly because it is the original from which Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors is, directly or indirectly, derived.
Yet it is by no means certain that the Greek play which Plautus is adapting, belonged to the New Comedy at all.
From line 12 of the Prologue " Non Atticissat verum Sicilicissitat" it is suspected of being the work of some Sicilian dramatist.
Indeed, many would attribute it to Epicharmus, in which case it would be very much older than the earliest Comedy of Aristophanes, And as a slight corroboration of this date it might be urged that in Act II, Scene 3, Erotium, running through the names of the sovereigns of Syracuse, stops at Hiero, the patron of Epicharmus ;
and that the abrupt­ ness with which she terminates her speech may be due to the circumstance that Epicharmus proceeded to mention some kindness shown by Hiero to the family of Menaechmus, which Plautus omitted as uninteresting to a Roman audience.
This too would account for the surprise displayed by Messenio at the intimate knowledge which Erotium possesses about the affairs of Menaechmus.
But on the other hand it is difficult to believe that so deftly-constructed a Comedy, with so intricate and ingenious a plot, can belong to so early a date.
And anyhow the play exhibits, in a marked degree, the general characteristics of the New Comedy.
The translation has been made, in idle moments, from Mr. Hildyard's edition of the play;
and his arrangement and explanations have been generally accepted without going further into the matter.
The long verses are intended to be spoken " in a species of recitativeMENAECHMUS, of Epiclamnus.
Menaechmus, his twin brother, formerly Sosicles.
PENICULUS, a parasite.
CYLINDRUS, a cook.
A DOCTOR.
Sailors, carrying luggage.
Four varlets.
Attendants, &c.EROTIUM, a courtesan.
Erotium's servant-girl.
THE first thing, gentlemen, I wish to do Is to give greeting to myself and you.
I bring you Plautus—not the MAN, the PLAY- Please to be gracious to his work to-day.
And kindly listen whilst I tell the plan, I'll be as brief as possibly I can.
One trick there is which all our poets ,try ;
Their scenes in Athens never fail to lie ;
By this they throw a Grecian air around them.
As for my facts you'll have them as I found them.
So to be Greek my tale will still endeavour, Sicilian-wise, not Attic-wise, however.
This little preface comes my plot before, But now the plot itself I'll pour and pour Not by the peck or bushel but by barns, So very generous am I in my yarns.
Once on a time, 'tis thus the story runs, A Syracusan merchant had twin sons.
So like they were, their very foster-mother Could not the one distinguish from the other.
Nay she who bare them did not really know ;
One who had seen the children told me so.
I never saw them, I was only told.
Well, when the children now were seven years old, The merchant freights a goodly ship, and bears
One little son amongst its numerous wares, And so they reach Tarentum, there to trade ;
At home the other with his mother stayed.
While at Tarentum, to the games they go, The people flocked, as usual, to the show ;
The boy was lost amid the concourse vast, Till in the crowd an Epidamnian passed, Took him in charge, and back to Greece they crossed.
But the poor father, when his child was lost, Lived a few days in heartless sad despair, Then sickened, pined, and died of sorrow there.
The mournful tidings to the grandsire sped
Of the lost child, and hapless father dead ;
Who such affection to the lost one bore
He changed the name the other had before, And as Menaechmus1 was the lost boy's name, The other boy must also bear the same.
That name my tongue more readily repeats Because 1 heard them cry it in the streets.
So then, beforehand, lest ye miss the plot, I say the twins the self-same name have got.
Now, that the facts ye clearly may discern, To Epidamnus I'll on foot return.
Can I, for you, do any errand there ?
If so, with boldness what ye want declare.
But you must give the wherewithal to do it;
Or else you're fooling, and belike you'll rue it.
Yet if you give it, rue it more you will.
Now there I am, though here I'm standing still.
The Epidamnian who, I said before, Kidnapped the boy, and o'er the waters bore, No child had he, his wealth was all he had ;
So he adopts the little kidnapped lad, Makes him the husband of a well-dowered bride, And heir to all his fortune when he died.
For once when, journeying to his farm, he fain Would ford a river swoln by recent rain, The river rose, impatient to destroy, And carried off the man that carried off the boy.
So his great wealth descended to the twin ;
And here you see the house he's living in.
His brother, with a slave, is come to-day To Epidamnus, if perchance he may Find there the missing twin.
This town must needs Be Epidamnus while our play proceeds.
Another play, another town 'twill be, For ever shifting, like our Company, Where one poor player acts or youth or age, King, pander, beggar, parasite or sage.
PEN. THE boys nickname me Sponge-Peniculus Because I clear away the crumbs so neatly.
And I believe that they who chain their captives, And clap their fetters on their runaway slaves, Defeat the object which they have in view.
If a poor wretch finds ill on ill redoubled, He only wants to run away the more.
He tries all means to extricate himself;
One gets a file and files away the links, One smashes out the rivet.
Oh, mere trifling.
Whom you would keep without one thought of flight Let him be strictly tethered by the tooth ;
Tie down his nozzle to a well-stored table.
So long as you provide him day by day Eating and drinking to his heart's content, He'll never flee ;
he'd sooner die than flee.
These are the chains to chain him safe withal.
They're so elastic, these same belly-bands, The more you stretch them, they but hold the tighter.
See here, I am going to Menaechmus now, A willing slave, that he may bind me so.
Aye, he's the man !
he does not feed us, he Recruits and sets us up ;
he's a prime doctor;
Himself a lad of excellent good living.
Such banquets !
Heavens, he loads his tables so, Piles mountain high his luscious dishes so, You needs must mount a chair to reach the top.
But now these many days I've given him rest, Housed in my house with all that's dear to me, For all the food I buy is passing dear.
But now these dear, dear comrades have deserted, So back I come to him.
Stay, the door opens.
Menaechmus'self!
I see him.
Here he comes.
MEN.
(Speaking, as he comes out, to his wife within.)
0 if you weren't so stupid an idiot, 0 if you weren't so stubborn and dense, All that you see your husband hating, you would yourself to hate commence.
And if you continue thus to act I'll have you home to your father packed.
Now whenever I go out walking, you must detain me, and demand
Where I am walking, what I am doing, what is the business I have in hand, And what I want and whither I go.
I've married a custom-house clerk, I know.
Whatever I do I'm forced to confess ;
Over-indulgence 'tis that has spoilt you;
now I'll my future plans declare.
Since I freely give you servants, purples, trinkets, wool, and dress.
Since you really want for nothing, Madam, you had better beware
And cease upon me a spy to be.
Still you shan't have spied for nothing;
therefore I'll find some ladye light, And I will make an express appointment, and I will dine with her to-night.
PEN. (Aside.)
Ah, he intends to hurt her feelings, but he is really hurting mine.
I am the sufferer more than she is, if he is going from home to dine.
MEN.
Goodness gracious!
by my scolding I have driven my wife away.
Come then, come, intriguing husbands, bring me your gifts without delay, Bring me your choicest gifts and offerings ;
I have battled it like a man.
Here's a shawl I robbed my wife of;
now it shall go to the courtesan.
Glorious deed, so sharp a turnkey, such a vigilant spy to cheat.
0, the action was bravely managed, quite artistic, clever, and neat.
At my peril I made the capture;
it shall now to its fate be taken ;
A terrible foe I have put to flight, and secured my spoil, and saved my bacon.

There.
MEN.
Even yet a little further from the lioness's lair.
PEN. 0, by Pollux of this I'm sure, you'd make a capital charioteer.
MEN.
Why ?
PEN.
You are always looking behind you, looking to see if your wife be near.
MEN.
Now what say you ?
PEN.
What you wish me, I affirm and I deny.
MEN.
Can you from the smell of something guess that something's history, When you have smelt it ?
PEN.
Sure the Augurs cannot guess it half so well.
MEN.
Come then, smell the shawl I'm wearing ;
what does it smell of?
won't you tell?
PEN.
At the top a man should always smell a womanly vestiment;
Here my nostrils are saluted with a most unsavoury scent.
MEN. 0, you're far too nice, Peniculus ;
smell it here then.
PEN.
That's the plan.
MEN.
What does it smell of there ?
inform me.
PEN.
A theft, a dinner, a courtesan.
MEN.
To my dearest dear we'll bear it, to my love, Erotium fair, She shall for herself a banquet and for you and me prepare.
We with her will drink until the Morning Star awakes the day.
PEN.
Very well and tersely stated !
Shall I strike then ?
MEN.
Strike away.
Nay, but tarry.
PEN.
You've retarded fully a mile the cup, I swear.
MEN.
Knock then gently.
PEN.
I suppose you fear the doors are of earthenware.
MEN.
Stay, 0 stay, Herself is coming.
Dear, how faint this Sunlight seems !
Sure her bright and lovely person puts to shame his meaner beams.
ER. 0 my life, Menaechmus, welcome.
PEN.
What then am I ?
ER.
You are one too many.
PEN.
So are the troops reserved in battle, yet they can fight as well as any.
MEN.
Prithee, to-day for dire engagements make the accustomed preparations.
ER.
That shall be done to-day for certain.
MEN.
Then we will battle with deep potations,
Then whichever shall drink the deepest, and in the fight shall conqueror be-
Thine are the soldiers, thou, give sentence which shall abide this night with thee.
0, but I hate my wife, my darling ;
hate her the moment you appear.
ER.
All this time you must needs be wearing some of her things, 'tis clearly clear.
What is that ?
MEN.
'Twas hers this morning, now it is yours, my Rosebud fair.
ER.
Easily are you the best of all who seek my favours, I do declare.
PEN. (Aside.)
Just so long the lady coaxes as she expects to share the fruits.
(Aloud.)
Yes, if you loved her best, your nostrils ought to be snapped off by the roots.
MEN.
Hold my cloke, Peniculus, will you ?
I will the promised spoils divest.
PEN.
Give it here.
Now dance I prithee in the womanly mantle dressed.
MEN.
Dance !
what, I?
You are mad for certain.
PEN.
Mad am I or you, the more?
Well if you will not dance, divest it.
MEN.
Verily I with danger sore Carried away this shawl.
The action unto the full I deem as rash, As when Hercules abstracted fair Hippolyta's queenly sash.
Take it.
Thou alone, compliant, humourest me in every mood.
ER.
Truly this is the generous temper, showing a lover is kind and good.
PEN. (Aside.)
Yes if they wish to ruin themselves, and live in poverty all their life.
MEN.
Only last year I paid ten pounds to buy it, a present to give my wife.
PEN.
Ten good pounds entirely wasted, as your account I understand.
MEN.
Sweet, do you know what I want you to get me ?
ER.
All shall be done as you command.
MEN.
Order your servants that they a dinner here in your house for ourselves prepare, And provide some delicate dainties, as an addition, from the fair.
PEN.
Delicate ham, a round of bacon, kernels out of the glands of swine, Half a pig's-head, a rich black-pudding, something or other in that line, Which, when dressed and served to table, at once will an appetite keen bestow, Let it be speedy.
ER.
It shall be done.
MEN.
And well meanwhile to the forum go.
PEN.
We shall be back again directly ;
then we can drink till it's served to table.
ER. Come when you will, 'twill all be ready.
PEN.
Do be as quick as ever you're able.
MEN.
Follow me you.
PEN.
Be sure that I'll follow, be sure that I'll keep you well in sight, Not for the wealth of all the gods would I lose you before our feast to-night.
ER. Call me out the cook Cylindrus ;
call me him out without delay.
(To Cyl.)
Take the basket, and take the money ;
here are three shillings to spend to-day.
CYL.
Thank you.
ER.
Go and provide a dinner, and mind you make it enough for three, Neither too much nor yet too little.
CYL.
Tell me what kind of folk they be.ER. I, and Menaechmus, and Peniculus.
CYL.
Then I must buy for ten at least:
He, the parasite, does the duty of eight good guests at his patron's feast.
ER.
That's your business, now that I've named them.
CYL.
They can at once, if you like, begin it.
In a minute 'twill all be cooked.
ER.
Be quick.
CYL.
Why, I won't be gone a minute,Men.
There is no pleasure to the weary sailor More great, Messenio, than the distant land Seen from the raging deep.
MESS.
One there is greater ;
It is to see the land you call your home.
But why, I prithee, have we come in hither ?
Are we to coast all islands like the sea ?
Men.
We come to seek my very own twin brother.
MESS.
And what's to be the limit of our seeking ?
'Tis now six summers since our search began.
And we have wandered round the coast of Spain, Istria, Marseilles, Illyria, Adria, And all the colonies of Greece, and all The sea-lashed coasts of Italy.
A needle
Who had so sought had found, if findable.
Go to:
you seek the dead among the living ;
Were he alive, he had been found long since.
Men.
I want to find a man to tell me so;
One who can say for certain
He is dead.
Then will I never seek for him again.
Till then, I'll never cease to follow him.
Dear to my heart of hearts is he, my brother.
MESS.
Knots in a reed !
We may as well go home, Unless you mean to write a book of travels.
Men.
You had better keep your proverbs to yourself.
Don't trouble me !
I'm master here.
MESS.
Alack !
That one expression shows me I'm a slave.
A fact was never more concisely stated.
Well, all the same I must, I will, speak out.
Listen to me, Menaechmus.
Here's our purse Full lightly stocked as for a summer trip.
And if we don't move homewards, I do think Youll lose yourself before you find your brothel.
Know you the manners of these Epidamnians ?
They say this town is full of debauchees, Full of deep drinkers, hungry sycophants, And nimble cozeners :
'tis said to be A very nest of wheedling courtesans.
And hence, no doubt, the name of Epidamnus, Unwary travellers find damnation here.
Men.
I'll see to that;
therefore, give me the purse.
MEss.
What do you want with it ?
Men.
I fear for you.
MESS.
How ?
fear for me!
Men. Lest Epidamnus damn us Through your misdeeds.
Messenio, you are amorous.
I am a reckless man, a dangerous man.
Give me the money, and we shun both dangers ;
You won't offend, nor I be angry with you.
MESS.
Take it and keep it;
I am glad you should.
CYL.
Well, I have catered to my heart's content, I'll treat these diners to a splendid dinner.
Why there's Menaechmus!
0, the worse for me.
Here are our guests parading up and down, Ere I've returned from market.
I'll accost him.
Good day, Menaechmus.
Men.
Thank you.
Know you me ?
CYL.
No !
how should I know you ?
But where's your friend ?
Men.
My friend !
Whom mean you ?
CYL.
Why, your parasite.
Men.
My parasite !
The fellow's mad, for certain.
MESS.
I told you sycophants were swarming here.
Men.
Whom mean you by my parasite, young man ?
CYL.
Why, Sponge.
MESS.
All right;
I've got him in my bag.
CYL.
Really, Menaechmus, you've returned too soon ;
I'm on my way from market.
Men. Pray, young man,
How are they selling sucking-pigs apiece ?
Tell me.
CYL.
One shilling.
Men.
Well then, take this shilling, Get yourself purified at my expense.
You must be surely mad, whoe'er you are, To vex a stranger so, who knows you not.
CYL.
My name's Cylindrus.
Know you not my name ?
Men.
Confound you, Cylinder or Coriander !
I know you not;
I do not wish to know you.
CYL.
I have a notion that your name's Menaechmus.
Men.
And so it is ;
there's nothing mad in that.
How know you me ?
CYL.
How should you think I know you ?
You know I serve your mistress here, Erotium.
Men.
I know you not, and she is not my mistress.
CYL.
You know not me, who always fill your glass
Whene'er you drink with us ?
MESS.
Alas !
Alas !
That I have nought to break his head withal.
Men.
You fill my glass?
I who before this day Nor saw nor came to Epidamnus!
CYL.
No ?
Men.
No surely.
CYL.
Then belike you do not dwell Within that house.
Men.
All who dwell there be hanged !
CYL.
What!
why the man's distraught, to curse himself.
Menaechmus!
Men.
Well, sir.
CYL.
Take a friend's advice, And that same shilling which you offered me Go, buy yourself a sucking-pig therewith.
For you yourself must certainly be mad To curse yourself as now you did, Menaechmus.
MESS.
0, horrid man !
0, most obnoxious man !
CYL.
This is his way;
he often jokes me thus.
He's wondrous merry when his wife's away.
Men.
Well now, what want you ?
CYL.
Have I bought enough Dinner for you, your parasite and lady ?
Or is more wanted ?
fen.
Parasites and ladies !
What are you dreaming of ?
MESS.
What can possess you To be so troublesome ?
CYL.
What's that to you ?
I know you not:
this gentleman I know.
Men.
By Pollux, fellow, you are mad indeed.
CYL.
The meat I've got will speedily be cooked:
'Twill soon be ready;
go not far away.
Any commands?
.ren.
Yes ;
go and hang yourself.
CYL.
Nay go yourself and—sit you down within,
Whilst I the meat to Vulcan's rage expose :
I'll tell Erotium you are standing here ;
She'll bring you in, nor let you stand without.
(He goes in.)Men.
Aye, is he gone ?
By Pollux, I perceive Your words come true.
MESS.
Stand by, and see what happens.
For here, methinks, must dwell some courtesan, As that mad fellow who has left us said.
Men.
'Tis passing strange that he should know my name.
MESS.
Not strange at all;
that's what these ladies do.
Whene'er a foreign ship arrives in port, They send at once their slaves and women down.
And if they find a likely man aboard
They ask his name, what countryman he is ;
And then they spread themselves like bird-lime round him.
Once in their wiles, he's plucked, and lost, and ruined.
Now in that harbour lurks a privateer ;
'Twere wise, methinks, to stand upon our guard.
Men.
You warn me well.
MESS.
Well I shall know I've warned you, If well and truly on your guard you stand.
Men.
No more;
the door is creaking;
let us note
Who's coming forth.
MESS.
Meanwhile I'll lay these down.
Look to the baggage, please, you galley-slaves.
ER.
Nay leave the doors so;
don't shut them but go And on what is within your attention bestow.
Let everything there that is needful be done.
Be the couches bedight, and the perfumes alight, For by sweetness and neatness a lover is won.
Pleasant surroundings are his bane, our gain.
But where is he, the cook declared was standing Outside the door ?
Ah there he is, my chiefest love, my best Most generous patron, paramount Here, in this house of mine:
I will approach and speak.
O soul of my life, what is this that I see ?
0, why wilt thou stand at my doors which expand
As wide as thine own at thy lightest command ?
Did I say as thine own ?
Why, whose else should they be ?
These doors ARE thine own ;
they belong but to thee.
Come, all is ready now, All that thou badest is prepared and done.
Come, and recline beside me at the feast:
Come in, dear love, come in.
Men.
Whom on earth does the lady talk to ?
ER.
You, to be sure.
Men.
And what with me Ever has been, or is, your business ?
ER.
Truly by Venus's own decree
You are the one I must needs make much of;
aye, and it's right your whims to please ;
You whose bounty has prosperous made me, given me wealth, and comfort, and ease.
Men.
0, the lady is mad for certain ;
madness or drink must needs derange her ;
Else she ne'er would address so freely me who to her am a total stranger.
MESS.
Didn't I tell you what would happen ?
Now the leaves are beginning to fall, Only tarry here three days longer, down will tumble the trees and all.
O these women of Epidamnus, regular traps for money are they.
Let me speak to the girl a moment.
Listen, my lady.
ER.
What do you say ?
MESS.
Where in the world did you know my master?
ER.
Knew him of course where he knew me;
Here, in the city of Epidamnus.
MESS.
Yes, in a city forsooth where he Never set foot till just this morning.
ER.
Ah, you're a merry wag, no doubt.
Will you not enter, my own Menaechmus ?
Better within than here without.
Men. 0, by Pollux, I can't imagine where she has got my name so pat;
That is a marvel I cannot fathom.
MESS.
Nay, but I'll tell you what she is at.
'Tis that she smells the purse you are holding.
Men.
Likely enough ;
we soon will see.
Take it yourself, and let's observe her, whether she loves my purse or me.
ER.
Will you not enter and dine, Menaechmus ?
Men.
No, but I thank you all the same.
ER. No ?
then why in the world did you bid me order a dinner against you came ?
Men.
Bid you, I, to order a dinner!
ER.
Yes, for yourself and your parasite too.
Men. Parasite ?
Who ?
she's really and truly the maddest woman that ever I knew.
ER. Sponge and yourself.
Men.
What Sponge is that ?
the one that I polish my boots withal?
ER.
He who came with you here this morning ;
he who was here when you brought the shawl, Which, you said, you had robbed your wife of.
Men. 0, what in the world is it all about ?
Gave you a shawl I had robbed my wife of!
a crazy woman, beyond a doubt.
Truly I think she dreams while standing, just in the style of the equine race.
ER.
Why do you make me a mock, Menaechmus ?
Wherefore deny with so grave a face
All that you did when here this morning ?
Men.
What have I done that I now deny ?
ER.
Why, that a shawl of your wife's you gave me.
Men.
If I deny it, I tell no lie.
Never had I a wife that I know of;
none have I now in the whole wide earth;
Never set foot within your dwelling ;
never once from the day of my birth.
There in the ship I lunched, then landed, and meet you here.
ER. Ah !
Mercy o' me !
What do you mean by "the ship," I wonder.
Men.
Ship, a vessel that comes oversea ;
Wooden its structure;
planed and jointed ;
oft by the mallet's stroke assailed ;
Full of pegs as a tanner's board, the board whereupon the hides are nailed.
ER. 0, no more of your jokes, I pray you.
Enter the house along with me.
Men.
*Tis some other, I know not who, it is not I you desire to see.
ER.
Do I not know you well, Menaechmus ?
Do I not know you, Moschus's son ?
Born at Syracuse, Sicily's town, or so at least does the story run.
King Agathocles ruled there first;
and next King Phintias came, I wot;
Thirdly, Liparo reigned ;
and then, the throne and kingdom Hiero got;
Hiero reigns there now, I fancy.
Men.
Nothing is false in the tale you tell.
MESS.
Jove !
she herself must have come from thence;
or how should she know your affairs so well?
Men. Hercules!
I can resist no longer.
MESS.
0, for mercy's sake go not in.
Ruined you are, if you cross her threshold.
Men.
Don't to tutor me now begin.
0, the adventure goes on bravely.
I as a guest shall be entertained ;
I'll assent to whatever she tells me.
Lady, you think me perchance cross-grained;
'Tis for a purpose I thus gainsay you :
'tis that I fear if the lad here knows, He to my wife will all the story about the dinner and shawl disclose.
Now, whenever you like, we'll enter.
ER.
Then you won't for the parasite wait?
Men.
Nay, I care not a straw for the fellow ;
nay, if he happen to come too late, Close the door and let him not enter.
ER.
Gladly I'll do the thing you say.
Know you the favour I'm going to ask you ?
Men.
I will at once your commands obey.
ER. Well, the shawl that you just now gave me take to the broiderer's shop, I pray, There to have it retrimmed at once, with fresh embroideries fitted and sewn.
Men. Hercules !
that's a capital notion, then of course it will never be known ;
Even my wife will never detect it, if ye two should happen to meet.
ER.
Then you will take it when you leave me ?
Men.
That I certainly will, my sweet.
ER.
Let us go in.
Men.
I'll follow at once, but first to my servant a word I'll say.
(She goes into the house.)
Hither, Messenio.
MESS.
What's the matter ?
Men. Dance and sing for my luck this day.
MESS.
Is there a cause?
Men.
There certainly is.
MESS.
A cause why you to the dogs should go.
Men.
Knave that you are ;
I've scarce begun, and yet already I've spoils to show.
Take to a tavern these sailor-lads as quick as you can ;
when that job's done, Come you hither again to meet me ;
mind you are back ere set of sun.
MESS.
Don't you recognize these enchantresses, master mine?
Men.
Be silent, do.
If I'm doing a foolish thing, 'tis I shall suffer ;
it won't be you :
This is a foolish ignorant woman, so far at least as I've made her out.
I'll despoil her.
MESS.
Mercy, he's gone.
He's gone to his ruin, beyond a doubt.
Swiftly the privateer is towing, towing the skiff to dire disaster!
0, the idiot I must be to think to control my lord and master.
Not to command my master bought me, not to command but to obey.
Come ye along that I may meet him at the appointed hour of day.
PEN.
More than thirty years I've lived, and never before in all that time Chanced to make so vile a mistake as I've made to-day ;
I call it a crime.
Into a public meeting I plunge, intent to hear what the speakers say ;
There I gape like a fool, the while Menaechmus quietly steals away.
He, I trow, to his love would go, nor wanted me there to join their eating.
Gods !
I pray that in wrath ye slay the dolt who invented a public meeting, Wasting the time of the busiest men who cannot afford their time to lose.
The idle crew with nothing to do we ought for a duty like that to choose ;
Then if they fail to appear when summoned let them be fined without delay.
Plenty of men can, I guess, be found who eat but a single meal a day, Don't invite, and are never invited.
What in the world have they to do ?
They are the folk to attend at meetings, and all our civic assemblies too.
Then I never had lost to-day the splendid dinner I had in view.
Sure as I live, 'twas the will of the gods that I this bit of ill-luck should find!
Still, perhaps, I may get some scraps ;
that hope a little consoles my mind.
Eh, but here is Menaechmus leaving!
out he comes with a coronal on.
This is a cheerful time to arrive when all the dinner is over and done.
Men. (Speaking to Erotium within.)
Will it content you if I bring it back
This very day so elegantly trimmed
You will not know it for the shawl it was ?
PEN.
The shawl to be new-trimmed !
the dinner done !
The wine all drunk !
the parasite shut out!
I am not I, if I avenge not finely Me and this dire affront.
I'll first from hence Watch what he's after ;
then I'll up and speak.
Men.
Immortal gods, when gave ye in one day
So many gifts to one who hoped them not ?
Dinner, and wine, and courtesan, from whom I took the shawl she'll never see again.
PION.
I cannot hear him when he speaks so low.
Is it of me and my mischance he's talking ?
Men.
She said that from my wife I stole the shawl, And gave it her.
And though she talked so wildly, I acquiesced in everything she said As though I knew it.
What my lady says I also say.
What need of many words ?
I ne'er enjoyed myself at less expense.
PEN.
Now I'll advance.
I'm spoiling for a row.
Men.
Who's coming here ?
PEN.
What say you, rascal, lighter Than lightest feather, false disloyal friend, Most worthless, treacherous, wickedest of men ?
What have I done that you should treat me thus ?
Why from the forum steal ?
How durst you here Entomb the feast alone, whilst I, the feast's Equal coheir, was absent from the grave ?
Men.
Young man, whose business with myself I know not, Why on a stranger vent such strange abuse ?
For your ill language do you want ill-usage ?
Ask, and you'll get it.
PEN.
That I've got already.
Men.
Tell me, young fellow, what your name may be ?PEN.
Deride me too, as if you know it not ?
Men.
I never saw or knew you till to-day, Not to my knowledge.
Whosoe'er you are, You will do well to prove less troublesome.
PEN.
Not know me ?
Men.
If I did, I'd not deny it.
PEN.
Awake, Menaechmus !
Men.
I am wide awake.
PEN.
Not know your parasite ?
Men.
I know full well Your brain is addled in your skull, young man.
PEN.
Did you not take away that shawl to-day From your own wife, and give it to Erotium ?
Men.
I have no wife, I took away no shawl, Nor to Erotium gave one.
PEN.
Are you sane ?
Didn't I see you issue from the house
Wearing that womanly shawl ?
Men.
Woe to your head !
If you play woman, think you all men do ?
What!
do you say I wore a woman's shawl ?
PEN.
Hercules, yes !
Men.
Go to the-place you're fit for ;
Or get yourself, you madman, purified.
PEN.
No prayers shall stop me now :
I'll go straight off
And tell your wife of all your goings on.
All these affronts shall fall upon yourself;
I'll pay you out for eating up my dinner.
(He goes out.)Men.
What can it mean, that every one I see Mocks me like this ?
But hark, the door is creaking !
GIRL.
Erotium prays you of your love, Menaechmus, To take, besides, this bracelet to the shop, The goldsmith's shop, and add an ounce of gold, And have the whole recast and renovated.
Men.
Aye, this and anything she wants besides
Tell her I'll take with pleasure.
GIRL.
Don't you know
What bracelet 'tis ?
Men.
I only know 'tis golden.
GIRL.
'Tis that you said you filched away by stealth From your wife's jewel-box.
Men.
I never did !
GIRL.
Don't you remember, pray you ?
Let me have it Back, if you don't remember.
Men. Stay;
0 yes, I now remember;
'tis that very one.
Where are the armlets that I gave her too ?
GIRL.
You gave no armlets.
Men.
Yes, when this I gave.
GIRL.
You'll see to these?
Men.
Aye, surely, tell her so.
I'll bring the bracelet when I bring the shawl.
GIRL.
I pray you get me of your love, Menaechmus, Two ear-drops fashioned ;
each, two shillings weight And won't I welcome you when here you come !
Men.
Well, give the gold ;
I'll give the making-up.
GIRL.
Nay, prithee give the gold ;
I'll pay it back.
Men.
Nay, prithee you.
GIRL.
I'll pay you twice the sum.
Men.
I haven't got it.
GIRL.
Give it when you have.
Any commands ?
Men.
Tell her I'll see to these, (The girl goes into the house.)
And-sell them presently for what they'll fetch.
Aye, is she gone ?
She's gone and shuts the door.
Sure all the gods augment, assist, abet me !
But wherefore linger, now I've got the chance
To flee for ever from these harlot haunts ?
Away, Menaechmus, put your best foot forward-
There to the left I'll throw my coronal;
If any follow, there they'll think I went.
I'll go and meet Messenio, if I can, And let him know what luck the gods have sent me.
WIFE.
Shall I endure this marriage-bond of mine, When all my goods my husband steals away, And to his drab conveys them ?
PEN.
Pray be still.
You in the act shall catch him.
Come this way.
Tipsy he was, and garlanded, and bearing
The shawl he stole to the embroiderer's shop.
Ah, here's his coronal!
Am I lying now ?
This way he went, if you would trace his steps.
And here's himself, just in the nick of time ;
But where's the shawl ?
WIFE.
How shall I treat him now ?
PEN.
The usual thing ;
upbraid him.
WIFE.
So I will.
PEN.
Draw back awhile ;
and from this ambush stalk him.
MEN.
Ah me !
how wild and wearisome the plan
We all pursue ;
our best and highest, most.
We get as many clients as we can, And ask not what the virtues of a man, But what his wealth, what income he can boast.
Or good, or bad, we reck not.
Rather, all
In alien hues we paint;
The " poor but honest " man, a knave we call, The wealthy knave, a saint.
Patrons fare ill, whose clients hold in awe Nor equity, nor law ;
Trained litigants, who many a solemn trust With perjured lips deny, Rapacious usurers, who by claims unjust
Their gainful business ply.
The trial fixed, they send their patron word, 'Tis he must shield them, howsoe'er they erred.
'Tis he their cause must plead before the Judge, Or Court, or People.
Even so to-day A tiresome client met me on my way, And held me fast, and would not let me budge.
So my own business I perforce must slight, And in the Edile's Court my client's battle fight.
There full hotly the conflict rages.
Knotty, intricate terms I offer, hoping to settle the suit off-hand, Make a lengthy subtle oration, more or less as the facts demand, All to prevent the staking of gages.
What does my fool do ?
What do you think ?
As true as I live, Forward he comes his gage to stake, and a surety good and approved to give Never in all my life I saw a man so utterly floored as he ;
Every single point in the case is against him proved by witnesses three.
Heaven confound the rascally fellow, he spoilt my day by going to law;
Aye, and confound myself besides, that ever the forum to-day I saw.
He spoilt my day:
a splendid dinner I ordered me here for a while ago ;
My darling is waiting within, I know.
Hither I came as soon as I could ;
but she's surely vexed at my long delay ;
Ah, but the shawl will make my peace, the shawl which I stole from my wife away, Bringing it off for Erotium's use, and leaving it here at her house to-day.
PEN.
Ha!
do you twig?
WIFE.
An evil man I've wed.
PEN.
Said he enough for proof ?
WIFE.
Enough he said.
MEN.
Now I'll go where Pleasure awaits me.
WIFE.
Rather say, where awaits you Woe.
Interest's due for your theft, I fancy ;
and (Striking him) thus I pay you the debt I owe.
What!
you thought to commit such crimes, and yet that your guilt would remain unseen.
MEN.
Wife, what mean you?
WIFE.
Me do you ask?
MEN.
Shall I ask of him?
is it that you mean ?
PEN. 0, away with your false cajolings.
At him again!
MEN.
Wife, won't you tell
Why you are cross?
WIFE.
You ought to know.
PEN.
The rogue dissembles;
he knows full well.
MEN.
What is amiss ?
WIFE.
A shawl.
MEN.
A shawl!
WIFE.
A shawl.
PEN.
What makes your colour alter ?
MEN.
Nothing at all.
PEN.
Except the shawl.
Aye, that is the fault that makes him falter.
Ah, you shouldn't have dined without me.
At him again with right goodwill.
MEN.
Can't you be quiet ?
PEN.
No, not I. 0 look, he's nodding to keep me still.
MEN.
Bless me, I neither winked nor nodded :
that is a charge I at once deny.
WIFE.
0, I'm a wretched unfortunate woman!
MEN.
Wife, are you wretched ?
Do tell me why.
PEN.
Nought was ever so bold as he !
The man denies what you saw him do.
MEN.
Wife, by Jove and all the gods (is that a sufficient oath for you ?)
Here I swear that I never nodded.
PEN.
This she'll admit;
but return you there.
MEN.
Whither ?
PEN.
Belike to the broiderer's shop, and fetch the shawl for your wife to wear.
MEN.
What shawl mean you ?
WIFE.
I'll say no more ;
he can't remember the things he did.
MEN.
What is amiss ?
Have some of the servants answered you back when their faults you chid ?
Ah, if they have, they shall sorely rue it.
PEN.
Now you are playing the fool, 'tis plain.
MEN.
Wife, you are troubled:
I grieve to see you.
PEN.
Now you are playing the fool again.
MEN.
Some domestic, I'm sure, has vexed you.
PEN.
Playing the fool as you did before.
MEN.
Surely it was not I who vexed you.
PEN.
Now you are playing the fool no more.
MEN.
I, by Pollux, have wronged you not.
PEN.
Pshaw !
now you are playing the fool anew.
MEN.
(Putting his arm round her waist.)
Wife, what is it that puts you out ?
PEN.
Hallo, the gentleman's coaxing you!
MEN.
Can't you desist ?
did I speak to you ?
WIFE.
0, take your arm, bad man, from about me.
PEN.
There you have got it!
Now hasten away to finish your dinner again without me.
Then, half-drunk, with your coronal on, deride me, standing that house before.
MEN.
I no dinner have had to-day, nor ever set foot within that door.
PEN.
You say you haven't!
MEN.
I say I haven't.
PEN.
Why, didn't I talk to you there just now?
Didn't you stand half-tipsy there with a flowery coronal round your brow ?
Didn't you say that my brain was addled ?
didn't you say that you knew not me ?
Didn't you say (0 impudence rare !) that you were a stranger come oversea ?
MEN.
Never since the hour I left you, never once have I come this way.
PEN. 0, I know you !
Little you fancied that I so well could your scorn repay.
All the matter I've told your wife.
MEN.
Why, what have you told her ?
PEN.
I don't know.
Ask her yourself.
MEN.
My wife, what is it?
what did he tell you a while ago ?
Why are you silent ?
why not tell me ?
WIFE.
As though you knew not, you ask me this.
MEN.
Troth, if I knew, I wouldn't have asked you.
PEN.
0, the dissembling knave he is !
No, you cannot conceal the thing ;
she knows it all;
I have all proclaimed Openly.
MEN.
What in the world do you mean ?
WIFE.
Well, since of nothing you seem ashamed, Since you will not yourself confess it, listen and I the trouble will show ;
Why I am vexed and what he told me, now, indeed, I will let you know.
'Tis that a shawl has from me been stolen.
MEN.
Stolen from me!
is it really true ?
PEN.
See how neatly the rogue is quibbling.
Stolen from HER, and not from you.
If from you the thing had been stolen, then 'twould be safe, nor be lost at all.
MEN.
Keep to yourself!
wife, what's the matter ?
Tell me.
WIFE.
I tell you, I've lost the shawl.
MEN.
Who was it stole it?
WIFE.
Well, by Pollux, the man who took it away should know.
MEN.
Who is the man ?
WIFE.
'Tis one Menaechmus.
MEN.
Surely a villanous deed, I trow.
What Menaechmus is that?
WIFE.
'Tis you.
MEN.
What, I?
WIFE.
Yes, you.
MEN.
And who says so, pray ?
WIFE.
I. PEN.
And I.
And then to his love, Erotium here, he gave it away.
MEN.
Gave it ?
what, I ?
PEN.
Yes, you !
you!
you !
Now wouldn't you like a night-owl hired, ) Always to say uhu uhu for we have said it until we're tired.
MEN.
Wife, by Jove and all the gods (is that a sufficient oath for you ?)
Here I swear that I never gave it.
PEN.
Rather swear that our tale is true.
MEN.
Really and truly it isn't given:
really and truly 'tis only lent.
WIFE.
Who but a woman, in Castor's name, should lend a womanly vestiment?
Who but a man should lend a manly ?
Nothing of yours have I lent at all, Never a cape or soldier's mantle.
Come, will you bring me back my shawl ?
MEN.
Yes, I'll bring it you back directly.
WIFE.
'Tis for your interest so to do.
i Never again shall you enter the house, unless the shawl you bring me too.
Now I'm going.
PEN.
And what's for me, for the service good I have done this day ?
WIFE.
When of aught you are robbed yourself, the like good service I'll then repay.
(She goes into the house, and shuts the door.)PEN.
That, she knows, will be never at all;
I can't be robbed, for nothing I've got.
Drat the husband, and drat the wife ;
I hope the gods will destroy the lot.
I'll to the forum ;
here I'm ousted ;
here I shall never be welcomed more.
(He goes out.)MEN.
Ah, she thinks she has trounced me finely, when in my face she slams the door!
Just as though I hadn't another, a pleasanter home, to take my ease in.
You I displease ;
well, that I can bear:
Erotium here I am sure of pleasing.
She'll not close the door against me;
when I'm within, she'll close it then.
Now will I go and ask my darling, will she give back the shawl again.
I another, a better, will give her.
Ho there, porter, unbar the door.
Summon Erotium forth, I pray you ;
here would I see her, these gates before.
ER.
Who is it wants to see Erotium ?
MEN.
One who is more his foe than thine.
ER.
Why do you stand without, Menaechmus ?
Dearest, come in.
MEN.
Nay, lady mine, Know you wherefore I come to see you ?
ER.
Are you not come my love to crave ?
MEN.
No, I am come to ask you frankly, Will you give back the shawl I gave ?
Somehow or other, I know not how, my wife has discovered the whole affair.
Sweet, you shall have one twice as handsome, and you shall choose what sort you'll wear.
ER. Shawl!
I gave you the shawl but now, that you to the broiderer's shop might take it;
Gave you the bracelet too, to take to the goldsmith's shop that he new might make it.
MEN.
Me you gave the bracelet and shawl to ?
Never !
never!
Reflect I pray.
Since I brought you the shawl this morning, since to the forum I took my way, Now do I first return and see you.
ER.
See me?
Your object is plain to see.
0, you are going to swindle me, are you, out of the things you received from me ?
MEN.
Going to swindle you?
No, not I.
Why, don't I tell you my wife knows all, Bids me restore the shawl I brought you?
ER.
Pray, did I ask you to bring the shawl?
Didn't you bring it yourself, unasked ?
And didn't you freely the gift present ?
Now you would take it again and keep it.
Take it and keep it then, I'm content.
Wear it, you and your wife, by turns;
aye, stuff it in both your greedy eyne.
Only remember;
never again shall you set your foot in this house of mine.
Me, who of you have deserved no ill, you are holding up to contempt this day.
0, if ever again you want me, bring your money, you'll have to pay.
Look you out for some other girl, and hold her up for a jest and scoff.
MEN.
Hercules, she's in a terrible temper.
Hi come back to me !
don't be off.ER.
Still are you waiting ?
What, do you dare to return and woo me ?
MEN. 0, she's gone too, Shutting me out.
Upon my word, I'm the shuttest-out man that ever I knew.
First my wife, and then my mistress ;
neither will listen, howe'er I plead :
Now will I go and consult my neighbours how they consider I'd best proceed.
Men.
It was a foolish trick to trust my purse
With all that money to Messenio's care ;
Into some brothel he has plunged, I warrant.
WIFE.
Now will I watch, how soon my husband comes.
I see him coming.
Saved !
he brings the shawl.
Men.
I can but wonder where Messenio is.WIFE.
I will approach and speak as he deserves.
Have you no shame, to come before my eyes
With that adornment, villain ?
Men.
Why, what now ?
What ails you, lady ?
WIFE.
Dare you, impudence, Mutter or speak a single word to me ?
Men.
What have I done that should prevent me, lady?
WIFE.
You ask me?
0, the impudence of man !
Men.
Know you not, gentle lady, why the Greeks Feigned Hecuba a bitch ?
WIFE.
I know not, I.Men.
Because she did what you are doing now.
She heaped abuse on every one she met, )
And therefore rightly was she called a bitch.
WIFE.
0, I can bear your wicked deeds no longer.
Far rather would I lead a widow's life
Than suffer all the wicked things you do.
Men.
'Tis nought to me, whether you keep your husband Or leave him.
Is it customary here To tell a stranger idle tales like these ?
WIFE.
What idle tales?
Sooner than stand such treatment I'll lead a widow's life, I tell you plainly.
Men.
Lead it and welcome, (I forbid you not)
As long as Jupiter retains his throne.
WIFE.
You said you never robbed me of my shawl,
And now you've got it.
Are you not ashamed ?
Men.
Why, Jove a' mercy, here's a saucy baggage!
I robbed you of this shawl!
which in my hands
Another lady placed, to get it trimmed.
WIFE.
0 then, by Castor, now I'll fetch my father, I'll let him know what wicked things you do.
Run, Decio, find my father, bring him here, Say that his presence is at once required.
I'll show him all this wickedness !
Men.
Are you sane ?
What wickedness?
WIFE.
Robbing your wife at home
Of shawl and jewels;
bearing them away To give your mistress.
Is not this correct ?
Men.
Tell me some potion, if you know one, lady, To help me bear your idle petulance.
I cannot tell what man you take me for ;
I have not known you since Parthaon's 1 time.
WIFE.
Me you can jeer ;
you will not jeer my father
Whom now I see approaching.
Look you round ?
Know you my father?
Men. Aye, when Calchas lived I knew you both, the pair of you, together.
WIFE.
You know me not?
You do not know my father ?iren.
Nor yet your grandfather, if he comes too.
WIFE.
Aye, this is like the rest of your behaviour.
FATH.
Fast as my Age permits, as suits the case, I'll labour on.
Aye, mine's a tardy pace,I'm not deceived ;
I know it all too well.
My strength has failed ;
my nimbleness has flown ;
My limbs with eld and lassitude o'ergrown.
0
Age, who wins thee, wins a bitter bane ;
A host of ills thou bringest in thy train, Ills great and sore, a lengthy roll to tell.
But now I wonder, what can this portend, This urgent call ?
what makes my daughter send
To bid me come without a moment's pause ?
For what's the matter, why she wants me so, She leaves untold.
But pretty well I know The reason why.
Some pettifogging strife Has risen betwixt the husband and the wife.
That, when she sends, is evermore the cause.
These well-dowered wives, they glory in their hoards ;
They fain would always lord it o'er their lords ;
Haughty, and proud, and arrogant are they.
Not that their lords from blame are wholly free, But wives should always somewhat lenient be.
My daughter's tale is evermore the same, "Another row," "my husband's much to blame," And that, I warrant, is her tune to-day.
Now I shall know what it's all about;
Here is she standing, her door without ;
There is her husband, glum, dejected;
'Tis just as I suspected.
I'll accost her.
WIFE.
I'll approach him.
Welcome, welcome, my father dear.
FATH.
Welcome, daughter;
well do I find you ?
what is the reason you call me here ?
Why are you grieving ?
why is your husband standing irate, and aloof from you ?
Here's been a battle-royal, doubtless ;
battle of words betwixt you two.
Tell me which is to blame, and briefly:
none of your lengthy speeches, please.
WIFE.
'Tis not I am to blame, my father;
there I can set your mind at ease.
0, but here I can live no longer ;
father, I can't;
you must take me off.
PATH.
Bless me, what in the world's the matter?
WIFE.
Here I am made a public scoff.
FATH.
Who is it makes you that, my daughter ?
WIFE.
Who but the husband you bade me wed.
PATH.
Here is a regular downright quarrel.
Haven't I often and often said Neither yourself nor yet your husband ever to me your disputes should show ?
WIFE.
How can I help it now, my father?
PATH.
Well, do you really wish to know ?
WIFE.
Yes, if youll tell me.
PATH.
Haven't I warned you always to bear with your husband's ways?
Not to be watching whither he goes, or what he is doing, or where he stays ?
WIFE.
Well, but he courts a wanton woman, living close by.
PATH.
And serve you right.
Trust me, the more you worry and vex him, so much the more will he court for spite.
WIFE.
Often he drinks at the wanton's table.
PATH.
Think you he'll drink the less for you, Either at hers or any one else's ?
What the plague do you want to do ?
Really you might as well forbid him ever to make an engagement out, Ever to ask a friend to dinner.
0, you'd have him a slave no doubt.
Really you might as well and wisely claim that his hands be always full, Sitting amongst your maids and servants, carding his daily task of wool.
WIFE.
Surely I have retained a counsel not for myself, but for him, to plead ;
Here you stand, but for him you argue.
PATH.
Nay, if I find he is wrong indeed, Then will I chide him far more sharply than you, my daughter, I've chid before.
Come, he allows you trinkets, dresses, maids in plenty, and household store ;
Sure 'twere best to be sober-minded, best in his doings to acquiesce.
WIFE.
Ah, but he rummages out my wardrobe, steals a trinket or steals a dress ;
Me he robs ;
and my own adornments go his mistress's stores to fill.
PATH.
That's ill-done, if he really does it;
if he doesn't, 'tis you do ill
Thus to accuse a man that's guiltless.
WIFE.
Why, father, look !
He has still the shawl:
And there's the bracelet he took the girl.
He is bringing them back, since I know all.
PATH.
Now will I go and accost the husband ;
then shall I quickly the truth find out.
Well, how goes it with you, Menaechmus?
what have you two had words about?
Why so gloomy ?
why is she angry ?
why are ye standing apart so far ?
Men. 0, by Jove and the gods, old man, whatever your name, whoever you are, Here I solemnly vow and declare- PATH.
Whatever about ?
what is it, I pray ?
Men.
Here I vow that never I wronged yon railing woman who dares to say I from her wardrobe fetched this shawl and carried it out of her house away.
0, if ever I've set my foot within the house where the jade abides, Make me, Jove, a wretcheder man than all the wretches on earth besides !
PATH.
Surely you can't be sane, Menaechmus, to say such words, when you know full well
That you yourself, you maddest of men, within that house most certainly dwell!
Men.
What do you really say, old man, that within this house I am dwelling, I ?FATH.
Can you deny it?
Men.
I do deny it.
FATH.
'Tis too absurd that you this deny, Unless you have shifted your home this night.
Come hither, daughter.
Can it be so ?
Can you have shifted your home perchance?
WIFE.
Why, father, whither or why should I go ?
FATH.
Faith, I know not.
WIFE.
He mocks you, father.
FATH.
Well, well, my daughter, your wrath restrain.
Do be sober a while, Menaechmus ;
enough we've had of this jesting vein.
Men.
Who in the world are YOU, old man ?
whence come you?
what's your concern with me?
How have I injured you, or her, that you should both so troublesome be ?
WIFE.
0, how vivid his eyes are growing!
0, look how over temple and brow Suddenly spreads a greenish tint!
Look, look how his eyes are sparkling now!
Men.
Come, if they mean to pronounce me mad, what better thing can I do or say
Than feign myself to be really mad ?
Perchance I shall frighten the pair away.
WIFE.
How he yawns and stretches his limbs!
0 father, what is our safest plan ?
FATH.
Come you hither, my daughter, keeping out of his reach as far as you can.
Men. Evoi !
Bromius !
Yea, I hear thee calling me forth to thy woodland chase.
Ah, but I cannot join thy hunting, cannot escape from this dismal place.
There on my left a bitch is watching, ready to bite me,—mad she is,- Here on my right is a bearded goat:
and 0, with those perjured lips of his Many and many an honest townsman he in his time has destroyed alone.
FATH.
Out upon you !
Men. Hark!
Apollo speaks from his high prophetic throne ;
Seize the vixen, burn her eyes out, burn with a flaming torch, he cries.
WIFE.
Help me, father !
help !
the villain's going to burn out both my eyes.
Men. (Aside.)
Me they choose to accuse of madness;
they were the first to be mad, I trow.
FATH.
Hist, my daughter !
WIFE.
What's to be done ?
FATH.
Well, what if to fetch my slaves I go, Bid them lift and carry him off, and safely there in the house bestow, Ere he create some fresh disturbance ?
Men. (Aside.)
By heaven, unless by some crafty trick I can the plot forestall, the rogues will carry me off to their house full quick.
(Aloud.)
Dost thou warn me to leave no inch of the vixen's face unscored with blows ?
Must I blacken it all ?
ah well, unless this moment away she goes, I'll obey thy command, Apollo !
FATH.
0 flee, my daughter, with all your might Lest he pound you to death.
WIFE.
I'll flee.
0 keep him, father, I pray, in sight.
Let him not follow.
0 wretched wife, to hear from my husband such words as these!
(She runs out.)Men.
Well am I rid of her;
but him!
Aha!
must I now Tithonus seize, Dissolute, bearded, tremulous dotard ?
Is it on him thou biddest me rush, And all his joints, and all his bones, and all his members to mincemeat crush Ev'n with the staff that himself is holding?
FATH.
Keep off!
You had better !
I vow you'll rue it, If me you touch with your finger-tip, or approach one single step to do it.
Men.
Yea, I'll obey thy dread commands ;
I'll seize my double-edged axe, and hew, Hew to the bone the dotard piecemeal, slicing his entrails through and through.
FATH.
Truly, methinks, I must take precautions, guarding my life with my utmost skill, Else I fear that this crazy fellow will work me harm, as he swears he will.
Men.
Manifold thy commands, Apollo !
now must I harness my steeds of war, Tameless, fiery, terribly-prancing, yoke the team and ascend the car ;
Under their hoofs I'll trample the lion, trample the lion so rank and old.
Now aloft in the car I'm standing;
I grasp the reins, and the scourge I hold.
Show your mettle, my strong wild horses, let the clatter of hoofs resound ;
On with vehement quick curvetting;
bend your knees and cover the ground.
PATH.
Me do you threaten with prancing horses ?
Men. Lo, Apollo appears anew!
Spring upon and murder the dotard, is it that thou biddest me do ?
Nay, but who is THIS that drags me from the chariot by my hair, Abrogating, 0 Apollo, thy commandments everywhere ?
(He retires into the background, as if the paroxysm were over.)PATH.
0 fatal, sad disease !
0 gracious gods,
How is he fallen from his high estate!
How sudden and how terrible his madness !
I'll go at once and summon a physician.
(He goes out.)Men.
Aye, are they gone, I prithee, from my sight, Who make me play the madman, though not mad ?
Best get a-ship-board safely while I can.
And, 0 spectators, if the old man returns, Pray don't inform him by what street I fled.
FATH.
My bones with sitting ache, my eyes with straining Till this vile doctor shall have done his rounds ;
And then 'twill be—Could hardly leave my patients.
Have set the fractured leg of Aesculapius, Item, Apollo's arm.
I stand in doubt
Is he a doctor, or a sculptor rather ?
But here he stalks.
Quicken your snail's pace, do.
DOCT.
What is the matter with your friend, old man ?
Possessed or frantic ?
Tell me what it is.
Has he a dropsy, or a lethargy ?
FATH.
I call you in that you may tell me that, And make him well.
DOCT.
The easiest thing on earth, I pledge my credit he shall soon be well.
PATH.
I want him cared for with exceeding care.
DOCT.
I shall get blown six hundred times a day, With such exceeding care your friend I'll care for.
PATH.
But here's the man himself.
Watch what he does.
MEN.
This is a cross and peevish day, when all goes wrong whatever I do.
What I wanted to keep concealed is blazoned forth to the public view.
That Ulysses of mine it was, my parasite-fool, who divulged the thing, Filling me full of shame and trouble, bringing disgrace on his host and king.
Ah if I live, the treacherous fellow shall for his fault with his life atone.
Why do I say “ his life " I wonder.
It is not his, it is mine alone.
He at my table and cost sustains it.
I'll of his BREATH deprive the man.
Then this woman behaves as falsely as is the way with a courbezan.
When to restore the shawl I ask her, wishing therewith to appease my wife, She has already, she vows, restored it.
Verily, mine is a luckless life.
FATH.
What does he say ?
DOCT.
That his life is luckless.
PATH.
Please to accost him now with care.
DOCT.
Health and strength to yourself, Menaechmus.
Why do you keep your arm so bare ?
Know you not that, in your disease, a chill may greatly retard your healing ?
(Under pretence of covering up his arm, the Doctor attempts to feel his pulse.
Menaechmus repulses him with violence.)
MEN.
Go and be hanged, you meddlesome fellow !
PATH.
Feel you aught?
DOCT.
Why I can't help feeling;
Not to an acre of hellebore-draughts will yield, I fancy, your friend's disease.
Now, Menaechmus, attend.
MEN.
What would you ?
Doer.
Answer the questions I ask you, please.
Which do you drink, white wine or red ?
MEN. 0, heaven confound you to all things illFATH.
Now is his madness beginning to work.
MEN.
And why not ask me, if such your will, Whether the bread I prefer to eat is purple- or scarlet- or saffron-hued ?
Birds with scales, or fishes with wings, are these, peradventure, my favourite food ?'FATH.
Fie !
do you hear the stuff he's talking ?
Had you not better, without delay, Give him a soothing draught or e'er his madness over him gains, full sway ?
DOCT Wait!
I'll ask him a few more questions.
FATS.
Goodness !
You'll prate us to death, I know.
Doer.
Answer me this ;
those eyes of yours, do they ever hard and immovable grow ?
MEN.
What!
you think me a locust, do you, you stupidest noodle that ever I found ?
Doer.
Answer me this ;
do you ever observe your bowels making a rumbling sound ?
MEN.
When I am full, they never rumble ;
when I am hungry, then they do.
Doer.
Well, there's nothing insane in that;
the answer is perfectly right and true.
Come, can you sleep when you first lie down, and sleep you soundly till dawn of day ?
MEN.
Aye, I can soundly sleep till dawn when all my debts I've managed to pay.
0 may Jove and all the gods destroy this questioner, root and stem !
Doer.
Now, indeed, is his madness beginning !
'Tis best to be careful with words like them.
FATH.
Nay, this language is far less wild than that which he uttered a while ago, When here my daughter, his wife, he said was a mad young bitch, and threatened her so.
MEN.
What did I say ?
PATH.
I say you're mad.
MEN.
What I?
FATH.
Yes you, who are standing before me.
You who threatened to trample me down, and drive your terrible war-steeds o'er me.
I am the man who of this accuse you ;
I was present, and saw the whole.
MEN.
I am the man who know that YOU the sacred crown of Jupiter stole ;
Also I know that you, for that, were into a loathsome dungeon cast;
Yea, and under the yoke were scourged, when out of the prison you came at last, Also I know that you murdered your father and sold your mother.
Is this not sane
Thus, for the charges against me brought, to retort the like on yourself again ?
FATH.
Now, whatever you're going to do, I pray you do it without delay.
Surely you see the man's a madman.
Doer.
Well, shall I tell you the wisest way?
Have him conveyed to my house forthwith.
FATH.
You think that best?
DOCT.
I certainly do, Then I'll at my discretion treat him.
FATH.
We'll do whatever's advised by you.
Door.
For twenty days I'll make you imbibe my potions of hellebore, day and night.
MEN.
For thirty days I'll string you up, and scourge your body with all my might.
Doer.
Run you and fetch your varlets here, to carry him hence to my own shop-door.
PATH.
Fetch, how many ?
Doer.
So far as I'm able to gauge his disease, not less than four.
PATH.
Certainly.
Keep you an eye on the patient.
Doer.
Nay I'll run home, and at once prepare
What is for his reception needed.
Order the varlets to carry him there.
PATH.
Yes, I'll see that at once they do it.
Doer.
Then now I'm going.
Good-bye.
PATH.
Good-bye.
(They go out.)MEN.
Now my father-in-law has vanished, and now the doctor.
Alone am I. Jove a' mercy, what ails the fellows that all at once they pronounce me mad ?
Why, from the very hour of my birth I never a day's disease have had.
Not one trace of madness have I, nor any quarrel or broil I seek.
I am in health like those about me ;
I know my friends, to my friends I speak.
Maybe, the people who call me mad a touch of madness themselves have got.
What's to be done ?
I'd fain go home, but here my wife will admit me not.
There again I'm denied admittance.
Verily I'm in a doleful plight.
Here, however, I'll stay at present;
they'll let me in, I presume, at night.
MESS.
A servant's virtue may by this be known, If the like zeal, and watchfulness, and care Be, when his lord is absent, freely shown As when his lord is there.
No man of sense his greedy guts will rate Higher than legs and back.
And well he knows what punishments await III deed or service slack.
The mill, the fetters, hunger, cold, and blows, Hard labour, fits of lassitude severe, These are the wages that a lord bestows
On worthless knaves ;
these are the ills I fear, I therefore to be good, not bad, propose.
Hard words I reek not;
I detest hard blows;
What a mill grinds, I'd liefer eat than grind ;
So all my lord's behests I keep with constant mind.
And this avails me much.
Their private gain Let others seek ;
I'll do the things I ought;
I'll serve with fear ;
from every fault abstain ;
Always at hand when sought.
Such are the useful slaves.
Who nothing fear, These greatly fear when punishments ensue ;
I little fear;
and now the time is near
When my reward is due.
The goods and the sailor-lads I've lodged, as master bade, in the tavern, and I Hither have come to meet him again.
I'll knock, and tell him I'm here, hard by.
0 that out of this lair of Ruin he by my aid could be safely won !
Ah, but I fear too late I'm coming, after the battle is over and done.
PATH.
Now by all the Powers I charge you, listen with heed to the words I say, What I've told you, and what I tell you, see that ye do it without delay, Let him aloft from the ground be hoisted ;
then to the doctor's shop be taken, If your ribs and legs ye value, and if ye desire to save your bacon.
Never you heed whatever he calls you ;
never you value his threats a pin.
Now already he ought to be hoisted ;
what are ye waiting for ?
Quick, begin.
I'll to the doctor's shop be going, there to await you.
MEN.
I'm undone.
What in the world is going to happen ?
Why do these fellows about me run ?
What are ye wanting ?
What are ye seeking ?
Why are ye closing around me so ?
Whither, 0 whither, away are ye bearing me ?
Ho, Epidamnians!
Citizens, ho !
Help, 0 help me, I pray and beseech of you !
Loose me, ye kidnapping rogues, leave go.
MESS.
What do I see, ye gods Immortal ?
Surely I see some ruffians there Hoisting my master up sky-high, and bearing him off to—I know not where.
MEN.
What, will nobody dare to assist me ?
MESS.
0 yes, my master, I'll more than dare.
Citizens !
here's a scandalous outrage !
What, shall my master, in opea day, Here in the street of a peaceful city, be seized perforce and carried away, He who amongst you a free man came ?
Loose your hold!
MEN. 0 help me!
help !
I pray and beseech you, whatever your name, Suffer them not on me to practise so signal an outrage in all men's sight.
MESS.
Help you ?
yes, I'll help and defend, and succour you, master, with all my might, You I'll never permit to perish, 'twere meeter for me to perish than you !
Now the fellow who's got you aloft there, scoop out his eye, my master, do.
As for these, in their villanous faces a plentiful crop of weals I'll sow.
Ah in an evil hour for yourselves ye are haling him off.
Let go !
Let go !
MEN.
Here's my finger in this one's eye.
MESS.
Then make the socket appear instead.
Hah, ye scoundrels !
Hah, ye bandits !
Hah, ye kidnappers.
VARLETS.
0 we're dead !
0, I beseech you, mercy !
MESS.
Loose him.
MEN.
Why have ye laid your hands on me ?
Give them with both your fists a dressing.
MESS.
Villains be off to the gallows-tree !
You, because you are off the hindmost, here's a special reward for you.
There, I've scored their faces finely, quite in the way I wished to do.
Pollux!
I came to help you, master, just, as I think, in the hour of need.
MEN.
Aye young fellow, whoe'er you are, may Heaven reward you for this good deed, But for you and your timely aid I had not lived till the set of sun.
MESS.
Then if right you would do, my master, grant me the freedom I've fairly won.
MEN.
Grant you freedom!
what, I grant you ?
MESS.
Because I have saved you sir, but now.
MEN. 0 you mistake, young man !
MESS.
Mistake?
MEN.
By father Jove, I protest and vow, Never were you a slave of mine.
MESS.
0 hush, for shame!
MEN.
But I tell you true;
Never a slave of mine has done so much for me as was done by you.
MESS.
Well, if you're certain I'm not your slave, why shouldn't you bid me at once go free ?
MEN.
BE THOU FREE.
Go WHITHER THOU WILT :
so far at least as it rests with me.
MESS.
What!
do you free me ?
MEN.
I certainly do, if mine the right to perform the deed.
MESS.
Hail!
my patron.
I'M 1 GLAD AT HEART, MESSENIO, THUS TO BEHOLD YOU FREED.
You, spectators, I call to witness.
But 0, my patron, command me still, Just as though I remained your slave :
I'll always be ready to do your will.
Still in your house I'll live, and now when home you journey, I'll go there too.
MEN.
Heaven forbid !
MESS.
And now, my patron, I'll go to the tavern, to fetch for you Thence the silver and goods.
The purse is safely sealed in my bag, I trow, And all the things for our journey bought;
I'll go and fetch them.
MEN.
Make haste, and go.
MESS.
Just as you gave them, I'll now restore them.
Here await me awhile, I pray.
(He goes out.) 1
There being no third person to pronounce this formula, Messenio pronounces it himself.
Nobody knew his name but himself.
For a repetition of these formulas, see the final scene of this play.
MEN.
0 what wild and wonderful things around me seem to occur to-day.
Some declare that I'In not myself, and close their houses, and shut me out, These two lately pronounced me mad.
I can't conceive what it'a all about.
Then this fellow who's going, he says, to fetch some silver ;
who vows that he One of my slaves has always been, whom I (preserve me!) have just set free, Tells me the purse of silver is mine, and he's bringing it here for myself to use !
Faith, if he does, I'll tell him again he's free to depart wherever he choose.
Else, if he chance to recover his senses, he'll claim the money which now he brings.
Surely they differ no whit from dreams, all these most wild and wonderful things.
Now though Erotium seems so cross, I'll try to make her my friend once more.
Maybe she'll render me back the shawl that I to my wife may the thing restore.
(He goes into Erotium's house.)
Men.
Dare you assert, you daring knave, that ever I've seen your face this day, After I ordered you here to meet me?
MESS.
Why just this moment, my master, pray Didn't I snatch you from four strong varlets who had you up in their arms sky-high ?
And you were invoking gods and men to come to your aid, and in came I Tussled and fought with all the four, and wrenched you out of their hands at length ;
Therefore it was that you set me free, because I preserved you with all my strength.
Then for the money and goods I went:
and you, returning, before me run, Meet me here, and at once deny the very thing that you just have done.
Men.
What, you allege that I set you free ?
MESS.
You certainly did.
Men.
'Tis certainly true
That sooner I'd serve as a slave myself than give your freedom, you knave, to you.
MEN.
(Coming out of Erotium's house, and speaking to those within.)
No, ye'll never make out, ye hussies, not if you swear by your eyes all day, That to your house again I came, and carried the bracelet and shawl away.
MESS.
What do I see, ye gods Immortal?
Men.
What is it now?
MESS.
Your glass I see.
Men.
What's the matter ?
MESS.
The man's your image ;
he is as like as like can be.
Men.
Well, by Pollux, he's not unlike me, if so be that my looks I know.
MEN.
Hail, young fellow, whatever your name is, you who preserved me a while ago.
MESS.
Hey, young fellow, unless 'tis irksome, tell me your name, I beseech you do.
MEN.
Far too great is your service toward me that I should aught refuse to you.
Therefore, I say, my name's Menaechmus.
Men.
That is my name, you must understand.
MEN.
I from Syracuse, Sicily, come.
Men.
And that is my home, and my fatherland.
MEN.
What do I hear?
Men.
You hear the truth.
MESS.
(Pointing to MEN.)
'Tis he that I know:
my lord he is;
I'm his servant beyond a doubt;
by a mere mistake I believed me his.
(Pointing to Men.)
Him I mistook for you, my master, and trouble enough I've given him thence.
(To Men.)
Pray forgive me, if aught I said to cause you, stranger, unwilled offence.
Men.
Now it seems that your wits are wandering;
don't you remember we two to-day Came ashore from the ship together ?
MESS.
Right you are and the truth you say, You're my lord ;
(To Men.) you, seek a servant;
(To Men.) welcome to you ;
(To Men.) to you farewell, He's Menaechmus.
MEN.
That's who I am.
Men.
What is this wonderful tale you tell?
You're Menaechmus ?
MEN.
I'm Menaechmus ;
Moschus was my father's name.
Men.
What, are you going to claim my father?
MEN.
No, young man, 'tis my own I claim, 'Tisn't my wish to play the robber, and steal your father away from you.
MESS.
0 ye Immortal gods, I pray you, let my unhoped for hope come true!
O unless I am much mistaken, here the two twin-brothers stand;
One their name, and one their father, one moreover their fatherland.
Now will I summon my lord apart.
Menaechmus!
MEN. and Men. Yes.
MESS.
Don't both reply,
Which of you two on the vessel arrived along with me.
MEN.
It was not I.Men.
I'm the man.
MESS.
Then come you hither.
Men.
Here I am come;
so now begin.
MESS.
Either that is a rank impostor, or he's your brother, the long-lost twin.
Never two men so like each other has it been yet my lot to see ;
Drops of milk, or drops of water, are not so alike as you and he.
Then your father and fatherland he claims them both as being his own.
Had we not better at once draw nigh, and question the man till the truth be known ?
Men.
Verily yours is a bright conjecture, and many thanks for your zeal I owe.
Go you on to finish the task;
and BE THOU FREE if indeed you show Yon is my brother, alive and well.
MESS.
I hope to show it.
Men.
I hope you may.
MESS.
Stranger, you say your name's Menaechmus.
MEN.
Yes, and the simple truth I say.
MESS.
This man's name is Menaechmus also.
Further, your native city is Sicily's Syracuse, you tell us ;
Sicily's Syracuse is his.
Then your father, you say, was Moschus ;
Moschus was his, as myself can tell.
Now if you two will kindly help me, methinks you are helping yourselves as well.
MEN.
Ah, young fellow, so much I owe you, I can nothing you ask deny.
Just as if for a slave you'd bought me, 111 with all your demands comply.
MESS.
Well, I hope to prove you brethren, of the selfsame father born, And the very selfsame mother, on the very selfsame morn.
MEN.
Verily that's a wondrous story.
Can you indeed your words fulfil ?
MESS.
Yes, if both will my questions answer, then, believe me, I can and will.
MEN.
Ask whatever you want to know ;
I'll tell you all:
I'll nought suppress.
MESS.
Isn't your name Menaechmus?
MEN.
Granted.
MESS.
Is not yours Menaechmus?
Men. Yes.
MESS.
Wasn't your father's Moschus?
MEN.
'Twas so.
Men. Moschus was my father's name.
MESS.
Are you not a Syracusan?
MEN.
Yes.
MESS.
And you?
Men.
And I the same.
MESS.
So far all exactly tallies :
help me to complete the case.
What's your earliest recollection of your earliest dwelling-place ?
MEN.
When we left it, I and father, for Tarentum, there to trade;
There amidst the crowd I lost him ;
thence was hitherward conveyed.
Men.Gracious Jupiter, preserve me!
MESS.
(To Men.)O, be silent if you please.
(To Men.)
Can you still your age remember, when they brought you o'er the seas ?
MEN.
Seven years old ;
I just was losing then my teeth, my earliest ones.
Never again have I seen my father.
MESS.
Know you this ;
how many sons
Had your father ?
MEN.
I'd a brother ;
only one, as it seems to me.
MESS.
And were you or he the elder ?
MEN.
Elder ?
neither I nor he.
MESS.
How do you mean ?
MEN.
We were two twin brothers.
Men.
Gracious are the gods to-day!
MESS.
0 be still, or I'll hold my tongue.
Men.
Nay I'll hold mine.
MESS.
I beseech you, say Bare ye both one name ?
MEN.
By no means.
Mine indeed has always been
As it still remains, Menaechmus.
Sosicles they called my twin.
Men.O 1 can refrain no longer;
every single note agrees.
0 my own twin-brother, welcome.
I'm your brother Sosicles !
MEN.
What do you tell me ?
How then comes it that you are called Menaechmus too ?
Men.
When the fatal tidings reached us, (father dead, and vanished you,) Then the names our grandsire altered, giving me what was yours before.
MEN.
That I well believe would happen.
Still I'll test you with one thing more.
Name our mother.
Men.Theusimarché. MEN. 0 then, everything concurs.
0 my brother, 0 unhoped for after all this lapse of years, Welcome, welcome !
Men.
O my brother, whom through years of toil and strain Vainly until now I've sought for, welcome to my heart again !
MESS.
(To Men.)
'
Twas for him the lady took you, not for yourself, I can plainly see.
When she asked you in to dinner, she thought, I warrant, that you were he.
MEN.
Pollux !
I ordered a dinner here to be for myself prepared this day:
'Twas from my wife to be kept a secret, because I had stolen her shawl away, And given it here to my lady fair.
Men.
Is this, my brother, the shawl you mean?
MEt;
.
How in the world did you come by that?
Men.
The lady invited me in, I ween, Her dinner I ate ;
her wine I drank;
I sat by the side of her, nowise loth ;
The shawl she gave me, the bracelet too ;
she vowed it was I who had given her both.
MEN.
Glad I am if to you, my brother, anything good has chanced to accrue
Owing to me;
she supposed no doubt 'twas I she was feasting, and lo!
'twas you.
MESS.
Cannot I now indeed go free, as you sir bade me a while ago ?
MEN.
Aye, for my sake, my brother, assent;
'tis meet and right that it should be so.
Men.BE THOU FREE.
MEN.
I AM GLAD AT HEART, MESSENIO, THUS TO BEHOLD YOU FREED.
MESS.
Ah, but a better sanction than yours it needed to set me free indeed.
Men.
All our hopes are fulfilled, my brother ;
were it not better that now we two Back to our home return together ?
MEN.
Brother, what pleases yourself, I'll do.
Here will I hold a public auction, here will I sell whate'er I've got.
Let us go in, my brother.
Men.
Surely.
MESS.
Now would I ask you for-know you what?
MEt;
.
What do you want ?
MESS.
To be auctioneer.
MEN.
I gladly grant you the boon you seek.
MESS.
Now shall I make the proclamation?
When shall it be?
MEN.
On this day week.
MESS. 0 yes !
0 yes!
This day week a public auction I of Menaechmus's goods will hold.
Farms and houses, slaves and chattels, all his effects will then be sold.
All for what they will fetch are offered ;
money down we of course require :
Even his wife will come to the hammer, if so be we can find a buyer.
Hardly, methinks, a round five millions shall we obtain for all we sell.
Now then give us your cheers, spectators, give us your cheers, and-FARE YE WELL."
Every student of Greek, old and young, will give a hearty welcome to the latest fruit of Mr. Rogers's brilliant scholarship and dainty wit.
It is hard to find lines which move one to anything but lively admiration.
The Commentary is a masterly example of how a beautiful poem should be handled."—Manchester Guardian."
The editorial work is just what it should be, careful, complete, and con­ vincing ;
and the translation is fascinating.
Mr. Rogers has far more than a scholarly knack of translation ;
he has a remarkable gift, a power of idiom which would as certainly have appealed to Aristophanes, as it commands the admiration of scholars to-day.
The English version is not only a delightful companion to the scholar;
it is highly entertaining in itself."—Athenæum,"
The Commentary is full of scholarly remarks on the language of the play, as well as interesting illustration of its matter drawn from modern as well as ancient literature.
But the chief feature of course is the translation, which shows all the point, force, and ingenuity, which we expect from the editor.
The Bird-call has all the 'heart' of the Shakespearian lyric.”—Academy.
"A piece of work admirable both for scholarship and literary insight."- Contemporary Review.“
It is almost superfluous to commend the scholarly fulness of Mr. Rogers's introduction, textual notes, and appendix to those who have read his previous volumes....
We may well say of Aristophanes, and in a measure of his translator also, κατεμελίτωσετὴν λόχμην —TheTimes."
We have only praise for his version.
The notes show not only a wide scholar­ ship, but a humanity and a knowledge of men and books so unusual in a classical editor that we confess that the notes alone make a delightful book.
”—Daily Chronicle.
"A rare combination of scholarly ability and the literary gift....
An ideal edition for a scholar who is not troubled by elementary difficulties.”—Tribune."
This is indeed a most valuable edition of the great comic poet.
The scholar, the man who merely likes to keep up his classics, and even the man who has no classics to keep up, can all meet upon the common ground of Mr. Rogers's fruitful revision of the text, his luminous and painstaking introduction, and the Attic grace and lightness of his English renderings."—Pall Mall Gazette."
Treats with conspicuous success the most brilliant of the plays."—Scotsman."
Sustains in every respect the reputation which the earlier volumes have won for this accomplished scholar."— Manchester Courier.“
The reputation of Mr. Rogers as a critic and translator of Aristophanes is of the highest, and the present edition of the Birds brings out his best qualities....
The charm of its exquisite lyrics lives again in such a version of the hoopoe's serenade as this....
The dullest of lads would be attracted by these delightful pages....
It is an admirable volume, and increases the debt which both literature and learning already owe to its author."
—Spectator,
"We have derived both pleasure and instruction from reading the notes.
But the translation makes the charm of the book.
Mr. Rogers has here a thoroughly congenial subject, and since he is at his best in lyric verse, he has here ample scope for his powers.
And as a whole the version is a brilliant success."—Guardian.
"Repeats his previous triumphs of insight and skill.
The spirit and the felicity of his rendering are unequalled;
it is truly Aristophanes in English, with all his spontaneity, vigour, and deftness.
Many old classical students will be delighted to renew acquaintance with the comedy in Mr. Rogers's brilliant pages."- Educational Times.Fcap. 4to, 6 vols. 15s.
