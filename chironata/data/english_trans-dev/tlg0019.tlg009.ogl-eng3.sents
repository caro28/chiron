THE comedy of the Frogs was produced during the Lenaean festival, at the commencement of the year B.C. 405, when Callias was Archon, that Callias who, to distinguish him from other archons bearing the same name, was commonly designated “the Callias who succeeded Antigenes1.”
It at once took its position, which has never since been challenged, amongst the masterpieces of the Athenian drama.
It carried off the prize at the Lenaean 2 contest, from the " Muses " of Phrynichus, which was placed second, and the “Cleophon" of Plato, which was placed last;
and the victorious poet was crowned in the full theatre with the usual wreath of Bacchic ivy.
But it achieved a far higher success than this.
It enjoyed the, apparently, unique distinction of being acted a second time, as we should say, by request;
and at this second representation the poet was again crowned, not now with mere leaves of ivy, but with a wreath made from Athene's sacred olive 3, an honour reserved for citizens who were deemed to have rendered important services to Athene's city.
It was not for its wit and humour that these exceptional honours were accorded to the play;
nor yet for what to modern readers constitutes its pre-eminent attraction, the literary contest between Aeschylus and Euripides.
It was for the lofty strain of patriotism which breathed through all its political allusions, and was especially felt in the advice tendered, obviously with some misgiving as to the spirit in which the audience would receive it, in the epirrhema of the parabasis.
There the poet appeals to the Athenian people to forego all party animosities, to forget and forgive all political offences, to place the state on a broader basis, to leave no Athenian disfranchised.
More particularly, he pleads for those who having been implicated in the establishment of the Council of Four Hundred had1 ever since been deprived of all civic rights.
They could vote for no candidate, hold no office, and take no part in the popular assemblies.
Other citizens, however illiterate, enfranchised slaves, half-breeds, and the like, would be hurrying on to support the most ill-judged proposals of Cleophon;
but they—men of the purest Athenian blood, and the highest and most liberal Athenian culture- must needs stand aside, as though they had neither part nor lot in the Republic of Athens.
Aristophanes calls upon the people to put an end to this anomalous state of things, and to re-enfranchise all dis- franchised Athenians;
τοὺς ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμ
ους ποιῆσαι.
His doubt as to the reception of his appeal is manifested in every part of the epirrhema.
It is the Mystic Chorus, he insists, the Company of the Blessed Dead who are taking upon themselves to advise the Athenian people;
the errors of the excluded citizens are described as slips and slidings, not deliberate, but occasioned by the wily machinations of Phrynichus ;
the people whom he is addressing are mollified by the appellation ὦ σοφώτατοι φύσει, although in the antepirrhema, where he feels himself on safer ground, he resorts to his more customary address ὠνόητοι;
while, both before and afterwards, he indulges in a wild vein of harmless jocularity, calculated to mitigate any ire which his boldness may have aroused.
It tells much for the generosity of the Athenian people, that instead of resenting the poet's appeal, they rewarded it with the highest and most exceptional honours.
For we are told on the authority of Dicaearchus, a writer of.
the very greatest weight on such matters, that it was this very appeal which won the admiration of the public, and obtained for the play the honour of a second representation 1.
And this is fully borne out by the well-known fact that on the next political crisis, imme- diately after the disaster of Aegospotami, the Athenians followed to the letter the advice of Aristophanes, and their very first step was Tous ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμ
ους ποιῆσαι, to enfranchise the disfranchised citizens. "
When your fleet was destroyed, and the siege commenced,” says Ando- cides 2, “ye took counsel together to create harmony in the state, and ye determined to enfranchise the disfranchised, and Patrocleides it was who introduced the decree."
He then sets out the decree, TO ψήφισμα
To Πατροκλείδον, and adds, " So then in pursuance of this decree, ye enfranchised the disfranchised3.”
So Xenophon speaking of the commencement of the siege says 4, “The Athenians, having enfranchised the disfranchised, held out."
So Lysias, though with his usual vague- ness and inaccuracy, says 5, " Your disposition was such that ye recalled the exiles, and enfranchised the disfranchised."
I say " with his usual inaccuracy," because it is certain that the exiles did not return until after the city had been surrendered to Lysander, and could not help itself.
It was one of the conditions of peace imposed by the Spartans.
Indeed, the passage already cited from Andocides goes on, "In pur- suance of this decree ye enfranchised the disfranchised.
But Patrocleides did not propose, nor did ye decree, the return of the exiles.
But when the treaty with the Lacedaemonians was concluded, and ye dismantled your walls and received back the exiles,” &c.
It seems certain that the comedy has come to our hands in the revised form which it assumed on its second representation.
The strange duplication of certain passages towards the end of the play must force itself upon the attention of the most unobservant reader:
a duplication which in my opinion arises in almost every case from the fact that the reading of the original play has crept from the margin into the text of the revised edition 1.
There is a very similar duplication, arising from the same circumstance, in some of Biron's speeches in Activ. scene 3, and Act v. scene 2, of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost.
But to my mind the most convincing passage is that contained in lines 1109-1114.
The Chorus have been exhorting the rival poets not to rest content with a mere general criticism of their respective aims and merits, but to come to close quarters, and to attack each other's dramas in every possible way, with a minute dissection of individual lines, phrases, and metres.
This would obviously require an audience not only thoroughly intelligent, as an Athenian audience would naturally be, but also thoroughly primed in the details about to be discussed ;
and it is impossible to doubt that on the first representation of the Frogs many of the most delicate hits would pass altogether unnoticed.
But this would not be so on the second representation.
The play would then have become public property;
it would be in the hands of the spectators, and they would not fail to appreciate and applaud every point as it arose.
And it is on this very ground that the Chorus encourage the rivals to proceed.
But if this ye fear, lest there be in the spectators any lack of knowledge, so that they will not recognize your subtleties when ye speak them, be not afraid of this, since the matter is no longer so.
For they are old campaigners now;
and each of them holding a book of the words is conning your clever hits.
The words οὐκ 'EO' οὕτω ταῦτ’ἔχει seem to imply that on the first representation of the play the audience were not always able τὰ λεπτὰ γνῶναι.
The play was acted about six months after the great naval victory of Arginusae;
about four months after the death of Euripides;
and about two months after the death of Sophocles.
The victory of Arginusae was the result of an almost unexampled effort on the part of the Athenian people.
Conon, their most brilliant officer, had been defeated at Mitylene, and was closely blockaded there.
One trireme managed to run the blockade, and bring news of his peril to Athens.
The Athenians received the intelligence in a spirit worthy of their best traditions.
All classes at once responded to the call with hearty and contagious enthusiasm.
In thirty days a fleet of 110 triremes, fully equipped and manned, was able to put to sea.
The knights had emulated the devotion of their forefathers (as recorded in the parabasis of the comedy which bears their name), and volunteered for service on the unaccustomed element.
The very slaves had been induced to join by the promise of freedom and, what was even more than freedom, the privileges of Athenian citizenship.
Further triremes, as the fleet went on, were obtained from the islands, till it finally reached a total of more than 150 vessels.
These exertions were rewarded by a victory which, if it was the last, was also the most considerable of all that were gained by the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War.
And the slaves who fought in the great battle were admitted to be free Athenian citizens1 on the same liberal terms as had been granted to the Plataeans who had escaped from their beleaguered city some one and twenty years before.
They were enrolled in Athenian tribes and domes and enjoyed all the privileges of Athenian citizens, they and their sons after them for ever;
save only that the individuals first enfranchised were not eligible for certain hereditary priesthoods (such as those of the Eumolpidae, the Eteobutadae, and the Ceryces), nor yet for the office of Archon.
This exception was right and proper.
It would have been very unpalatable for an Athenian to see a man who had been brought up altogether outside the Athenian traditions, and still more so for a master to see his former slave, occupying the supreme position of Archon.
Yet even these excepted offices were not withheld from the children of the Plataean, or of the slave, even though they were born before their father acquired the Athenian citizenship.
The wholesale conversion of loyal slaves into free Athenian citizens, which met with the warmest approval of Aristophanes, readily lent itself to comic humour;
and throughout the play, whenever he alludes to the battle of Arginusae, this incident is sure to crop up.
In the epirrbema, which we have already discussed, “Shalt we give the fran- chise,” ask the Chorus, " to slaves who have fought but one battle, and yet withhold it from freeborn Athenians, who, and whose fathers before them, have fought so many battles for Athens ?” " 0 why was I not at the sea-fight ? " cries Xanthias to his master1, " I would have bidden you go and be hanged;
I would hare snapped my fingers at your commands.”
“I take no slave on my ferry,” says Charon 2, “unless he fought in the sea-fight,” in which case, be it observed, he would not be a slave at all.
And this consideration will, I think, lead us to the true signification of a much misunderstood phrase in the last-mentioned passage, where the battle of Arginusae is described as the sea-fight περὶ τῶν κρεῶν."
I take no slave," says Charon, A μὴ νεναυμάχηκε τὴν περὶ τῶν κρεῶν.
The word κρέας, as Aristarchus 3 is quoted by the Scholiast as saying, is frequently used for σῶμα;
and such is doubtless its meaning here.
Now a slave's body belonged not to himself but to his master.
For a slave's body, such is fate, belongs
Not to himself, but to the man who bought him.
But a free man's body is his own;
and he therefore who, in the courts of law or elsewhere, was contending for his freedom (as opposed to slavery), was said περὶ TOV σώματος ἀγωνίζεσθαι to be contending for his body, that is to say, for the ownership of his body.
A remarkably apposite illustration of this usage is supplied by the brief, but inter- esting, oration of Lysias, Against Pancleon.
The plaintiff had taken proceedings before the Polemarch against Pancleon, believing him to be a resident alien.
To these proceedings Pancleon pleaded that he was a " Plataean " enrolled in the tribe Hippothoontis, and the deme of the Deceleians, and was therefore a full Athenian citizen, over whom the Polemarch had no jurisdiction.
And the action was accordingly set down to be heard, not on its merits, but on this preliminary plea to the jurisdiction.
The oration of Lysias was intended for the plaintiff's speech on the trial of this preliminary issue.
It attempts to show that Pancleon, so far from being a “Plataean,” was not even a free man (μὴ ὅτι Πλαταιέα εἶναι, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐλεύθερον), but the runaway slave of a " Plataean” master;
and that on a previous occasion he feared to bring his claim to the proof;
εὖ εἰδὼς ἑαυτὸν ὄντα δοῦλον, ἔδεισεν ἐγγυητὰς καταστήσας περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι, metuisse, as Reiske translates it, periculum judicii de ingenuitate adire.
Here we have the expression περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι applied to a slave contending for the rights of a “Plataean,” the identical position of the slaves who fought at the battle of Arginusae.
So far, therefore, as these slaves are con- cerned—and it is only to them that the observation of Charon is addressed—the battle of Arginusae was in truth a μάχη περὶ τῶν σωμάτων, or in a comedians language, a μάχη περὶ τῶν κρεῶν.
And this, I am persuaded, is the sense in which the words are here employed.
The opinions which have hitherto prevailed are given in the note below1.
To the subsequent tragedy, which made the victory of Arginusae a word of shame, instead of a word of glory, in the annals of Athens-
I mean the condemnation of the victorious generals, and the execution of the six who ventured within the reach of the democracy—Aristophanes makes but one, and that a very faint and obscure, allusion.
Aeschylus is considering whether it is right to predicate of Oedipus that he was ever deserving of the epithet εὺδαίμων ;
and running through the various calamities of his life, he comes at last to the statement, he blinded himself, whereupon Dionysus at once cuts in with the remark- meaning, I suppose, that had Oedipus been a colleague of Erasinides in the στρατηγία, his blindness would have been a piece of good fortune.
For then he would not have gone to the great battle, and so would not have fallen a victim to the machinations of Theramenes and the madness of the people.
This is the only direct allusion to the fate of the generals.
But doubtless it was to the attack of "the blear-eyed Archedemus " upon Erasinides, the precursor of the graver charge, that the scorn and contempt with which he is twice2 mentioned in this play are mainly due;
and Theramenes owes the ironical censure twice3 passed upon his career rather to the fatal ingenuity with which he shifted the blame from his own shoulders to those of.
the generals, than to his former double- dealing in the affair of the Four Hundred.
At the commencement of the play we find Dionysus journeying to the world below, for the express and only purpose of bringing back Euripides to the Athenian stage.
And one reason which he gives for the selection of Euripides is that he is a πανοῦργος, a man up to anything, a master of shifts and evasions, who would readily assist in carrying out any plan that might be devised for his rescue.
We should therefore naturally suppose that we were intended presently to witness a series of scenes analogous to those in the Thesmophoriazusae ;
we should expect to see Euripides utilizing for the purpose of effectuating his own escape some of the ingenious schemes and devices contained in his own plays, just as he had utilized them in the earlier comedy for the purpose of effectuating the escape of Mnesilochus.
But nothing of the kind occurs ;
there is no idea of an escape;
no artful contrivance is required;
the plot takes an entirely different trend;
nor is Euripides brought back.
We shall return to this subject shortly.
The Chorus of the play are the Blessed Mystics, those who had on earth been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, and had led a holy and virtuous life in accordance with the doctrines therein inculcated.
But before they make their entrance in that character their voices have been heard from behind the scenes chanting the melodious songs of the dead frogs, from whom the comedy derives its name.
They do not enter until some scenes later, and then they come in singing a series of hymns and songs, which are not, as commonly supposed, mere unconnected lyrics, but are a continuous presentation of the earlier stages of their annual procession to Eleusis, from the moment when they call Iacchus forth from his sumptuous temple at Athens down to the time when, having passed over the bridge of Cephisus, they are streaming away to weave their mystic sports and dances on the Thriasian plain.
Brimful as the comedy is of genial humour and exuberant vivacity, it nevertheless, to my mind at least, is everywhere invested with a certain solemnity.
This is doubtless due, in part, to the fact just mentioned, that the Chorus consists not, as in other comedies, of Athenian citizens, or of comic creations, but of dead mystae, performing in the world below the religious ceremonies which they had, in life, performed in the world above ;
and partly again to the circumstance that the action lies chiefly among the dead, and that the great poetical contest which it describes is a contest between two dead poets;
but most of all, perhaps, to our knowledge of the terrible time at which the play was produced, when the long anguish of the Deceleian War was visibly drawing to a close, and when the Athenian Empire certainly, and possibly the very existence of Athens, seemed in risk of immediate extinction.
After passing through various adventures Dionysus arrives safely at the halls of Pluto, and we are at once confronted with an entirely unexpected situation.
For it so happens that, at the moment of his arrival, a dramatic contest is about to commence between Aeschylus and Euripides;
and Dionysus, clean forgetting the errand on which he came, readily undertakes to act as judge.
The actual contest, without reckoning either the preliminary discussions or the political catechism by which it is succeeded, occupies 551 lines (from 875 to 1413, according to Brunck's numbering, which is adopted by all editors, whatever the number of their own lines may be), more than a third of the entire play.
Its object is to determine which is the better tragedian of the two;
and the rivals discuss not only their general merits and demerits, but also various subordinate questions, their prologues, their choral metres, and the weight of their iambic verses.
And all their dramatic stores, both old and new, TO.
τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ καινὰ, are ransacked for passages to support their respective contentions.
It is difficult to believe that all this detailed and elaborate criticism, together with the remainder of the play in which it is found, can have been entirely worked out during the very brief period which had elapsed since the death of Euripides;
especially since from that period itself we must deduct, at its commencement, the time that would pass before the news of the poet's death, which occurred in Macedonia, would have been received at Athens;
and at its'close, the time required for the submission of the play to, and its acceptance by, the Archon;
the granting of a Chorus;
the training of the Chorus;
the rehearsals;
and all the arduous preparation required for placing the comedy on the stage.
It seems far more probable that the contrast between Aeschylus and Euripides, which had been present 1 to the mind of Aristophanes from the very commencement of his career, had taken this form before the younger tragedian's death;
and that Aristophanes, finding the time too short for the completion of the play on the lines originally intended, fell back upon this great scene which was ready to his hand, and inserted it in a comedy with the plot of which it was quite unconnected.
And, indeed, it can hardly be said to be woven into the texture of the play at all;
it is but loosely tacked on, and the stitches by.
which it is attached to the main fabric are quite visible to a careful observer.
Nothing can be more abrupt than the manner in which the first mention of the contest is dragged in, some 120 lines before the contest itself begins.
It does not spring out of anything which has gone before.
Two slaves are talking, and in the very midst of a speech one of them breaks off, and asks the other, 1 Why, what is the meaning of all that hubbub ?
And the other explains that a contest is impending between the two great tragedians.
And when we come to the contest itself there is not, throughout its whole progress (from line 875 to line 1413), a single syllable tending to show that it is taking place in the world below;
nor is Euripides ever spoken of as if he were dead.
On the contrary, there is one passage from which, if this scene were detached from the rest of the play, we should certainly assume that he was still alive.
To the question what Euripides deserves if the charges brought against him by Aeschylus are sustained, Dionysus promptly replies, " He deserves to DIE 2."
In itself the language seems to imply that he was still alive:
although, as the play stands, it is of course a mere joke, the joke of dooming to death a person who is already dead.
And in truth the poetical contest is so foreign to the general purpose of the play, that we cannot be surprised to find that it ends in a complete fiasco.
Dionysus, the chosen judge, having heard the entire competition, declares himself unable or unwilling to give any judgement at all.
And now a singular thing occurs.
Pluto, who has been present during the last 600 lines, or thereabouts, without once opening his mouth, suddenly breaks silence, and announces that the successful poet-whose promised reward has hitherto been the right to occupy the Chair of Tragedy in the Prytaneum of Hades-shaH return with Dionysus to the world above.
We therefore, at the close of the poetical contest, return to the old purpose of the play as abruptly as we left it when that contest commenced.
And Dionysus marks the change more distinctly by declaring that he will choose, not necessarily the better tragedian (which was the sole object of the poetical competition), but the man who can give to the State the wiser political counsel.
The counsel of Aeschylus—that Alcibiades shall be recalled, and the entire resources of the State devoted to the aggrandizement of the fleet-commends itself to Dionysus, who on that ground, and that only, awards the victory to Aeschylus.
And Aeschylus therefore it is who .reascends to earth, to do what he can for the city in her hour of need.
Yet the decision, though made without the slightest reference to the dramatic merits of the two contending tragedians, carries with it, strangely enough 1, the right to occupy the Tragic Chair.
All this curious jumble is occasioned by the clashing of the two motives, the motive of the poetical contest, and the motive of the general plot of the comedy.
Whatever may be the secret history of this poetical contest, it has always formed a most important, and to modern readers probably the most interesting, section of the Comedy of the Frogs.
It consists of four distinct trials of strength, divided from each other by choral songs;
the rivals discussing (1) their general merits and demerits, (2) their prologues, (3) their choral metres, and (4) the weight of their iambic verses.
It may, perhaps, be permissible to make a few observations on this great contest here, at somewhat greater length than would be con- venient in a footnote.
This, though by far the most important, one might almost say the only important and serious, part of the criticism, need not delay us long.
To enter at large into the perennial controversy as to the relative merits of Aeschylus and Euripides is no part of the duty of an editor of Aris- tophanes.
But a few brief remarks may not be considered out of place.
It must be remembered that this is not the case of two poets striving after the same ideal, and one approaching it more closely than the other.
Their ideals, their aims, their views of the tragic art are in almost every respect diametrically opposed;
so that what to the one might seem the chief merit of a play, to the other might appear its greatest defect.
The object of Aeschylus was to elevate the drama :
to give to his audience an impressive and worthy representation of the demigods and heroes of their noble traditions.
To this end he intro- duced the stately robe, the lofty buskin :
and, far more important than robe or buskin, the lofty sentiment and the stately language.
To Euripides all this appeared mere idle pomposity:
his aim was to bring down the drama to the level of ordinary humanity and every-day life.
And this contrast is the main topic in the first encounter of the poetical contest.
In it each poet is made to give his own view of the aims and objects which tragic poets should set before them:
Aeschylus considering it their duty to describe heroic deeds, and clothe noble thoughts in noble language;
whilst Euripides insists that they ought to portray the world as they find it, describing the deeds, unveiling the motives, and employ- ing the language, of daily life.
The idea of Aeschylus is to elevate and exalt the minds of the audience:
the idea of Euripides is to paint the world, its passions and infirmities, as they really are 1.
Each may be considered to have summed up his own theory in a single half-verse.
Πάνυ δὴ ΔΕl χρηστὰ λέλειν ἡμᾶς (1056),
It is our bounden duty to speak what is noble and good, is the language, and might be taken as the motto, of Aeschylus;
χρὴ φράζειν ἀνθρωπείως (1058),
We ought to speak all other men speak, is the language and motto of Euripides.
Each theory will always have its advocates ;
it is my good fortune, as a translator of Aristophanes, to be in entire accord with the views of my author.
From the foregoing considerations it naturally follows that neither poet altogether denies the charges advanced by the other.
He merely denies that the characteristic attacked is a blemish, and claims it as a merit.
If Euripides reproaches Aeschylus with his gigantic com- pounds and grandiloquent language, Aeschylus does not deny the grandiloquence, but maintains that his is the only diction befitting the divine and heroic personages which both poets brought upon the stage.
If Aeschylus censures his opponent for infusing a talkative and argumentative spirit into the Athenian people, Euripides is so far from denying the charge, that he glories in it as one of his brightest achieve- ments.
They agree as to the facts :
they differ only in their estimate of the facts.
Perhaps one other point should be mentioned.
It is frequently said that the antagonism of Aristophanes to the dramatic influence of Euripides was based on considerations of morality.
And this is per- fectly true;
only it must not be understood as suggesting that Euripides was, in any sense whatever, the holder or propagator of immoral prin- ciples.
But1 the great civic and social virtues, honour and justice and valour, patriotism and self-devotion, respect to parents and reverence to the gods, and the like-virtues which to Aeschylus, and generally to the Athenians of the old heroic days, were matters of conscience, about which no discussion could be tolerated-were by Euripides brought to the test of " that universal solvent, the wild living intellect of man."
There were few, if any, virtues, and few, if any, vices, for and against which a store of arguments might not be found somewhere in the plays of Euripides.
And though he himself might conclude in favour of the right, yet he left it open for a more powerful or more plausible reasoner to turn the scale in favour of the wrong.
Euripides might hold, as Hippolytus in the tragedy named after him did certainly hold, that an oath must be kept inviolate, even though taken in ignorance of what it involved;
but the theory that in some circumstances an oath might not be binding on the conscience, had been disseminated amongst a quick and ingenious audience, and might bring forth fruit which the poet little meant.
I do not propose to enter more largely into this part of the con- troversy between the two poets;
but some very admirable and instructive remarks on the subject, which I have been permitted by the kindness of Sir R. C. Jebb to extract from his lectures on " The Growth and Influence of Classical Greek Poetry," will be found in a separate note at the end of this Introduction.
In the second encounter the combatants no longer deal with the general theory of tragic poetry, but commence their criticism of special portions of a tragic play.
"We will first begin with the prologue," Euripides is made to observe, since the prologue is the first beginning of a play."
But in truth there is no method in these attacks.
Aristo- phanes merely selects one point here and another there, just as they seem to afford the readiest handle to his wit and satire.
Euripides was accustomed to make his prologue an exposition of the facts upon which his play was founded ;
a vehicle for conveying to the audience the information which was necessary to bring them to the point at which the action of the drama commenced.
His prologues, as a rule, consisted of a lucid and neatly-worded historical narrative;
and the charge which he first brings against his rivals prologues is founded on the obscurity and ambiguity (ἀσάφεια) of their language.
It must be admitted that he could not have selected a prologue more suitable for his purpose than the stately and impressive lines with which the Choephoroe opens;
lines, it is to be observed, which do not exist in the imperfect MS. of the Choephoroe, and which would have been altogether lost if they had not been cited in the Frogs.
The lines are spoken by Orestes over the grave of his murdered father :
—
The first line consists of five words only ;
but each of its '.last three words is susceptible of two very different interpretations, neither 'of which can be called in any way repugnant to the context.
Πατρῷα may signify either " belonging to my father, Agamemnon," or " belonging to thy father Zeus";
κράτη may refer either to an earthly rule, or to a divine attribute;
whilst ἐποπτεύων may be employed either in the ordinary sense of " surveying, overlooking" or in the special1 Eleu- sinian sense of "participating in."
Euripides takes the first (or human) interpretation of each word :
Aeschylus explains that he meant them all to bear the second.
Euripides understands them to mean " overlooking my father's realm" and inquires whether the god of craft was supposed to be looking on when Agamemnon met his death by a woman's craft.
Aeschylus replies that the expression πατρῷα κράτη refers to the benignant power of the supreme divinity, Zεὺς σωτὴρ, the saviour Zeus• and that Orestes is beseeching Hermes to take up that great power, and so become a saviour to him, σωτὴρ γενοῦ μοι2 Widely different as these inter- pretations are from each other, they are both legitimate explanations of the Greek, nor can either be said to be unsuitable to the circumstances under which the words were uttered.
Herein lies the ἀσάφεια of which Euripides complains.
And he charges the lines cited with yet another defect, namely, the defect of tautology.
Of this he gives two instances.
The first is in the third line ἥκω ... καὶ κατέρχομαι. ἥκω and κατέρ- χομαι mean exactly the same thing, he says.
Aeschylus has no difficulty in showing that this is not the case.
ἥκειν, he points out, may be predicated of anybody arriving anywhere;
it connotes nothing beyond the mere fact of arrival;
whilst κατέρχεσθαι involves the further idea of the exile returning to his home.
This is true, and yet perhaps the answer is not quite satisfactory.
It shows that κατέρχομαι introduces a new idea, beyond what ἥκω, by itself, would convey;
but it does not show that the meaning of κατέρχομαι is in any way extended by the addition of ἥκω.
And so with the next objection, κλύειν, ἀκοῦσαι, which is only met by a joke of Dionysus.
It is possible that ἀκοῦσαι may signify more than κλύειν (κλύοντες OVK ἤκουον Prom. 456), but κλύειν, apparently, does not imply anything not comprehended in ἀκοῦσαι.
In neither case is the meaning of the two words identical, but in each the second appears to comprehend the first.
The true answer to objections of this character is that this is the prayer of Orestes over the grave, now beheld for the first time, of his mighty and cruelly murdered father, whose death he has returned to avenge;
and that in moments of strong emotion and exaltation of feeling the soul can only satisfy itself by repeated iteration of the selfsame thought.
Take the appeal of a lover to his mistress;
take, as in the passage before us, the uplifting of the soul in prayer;
take the litanies of the Church in all ages.
Our own Liturgy1 teems with such instances.
I may perhaps, without offence, quote some passages from the General Exhortation ;
" to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wicked- ness" "with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart," " by His infinite goodness and mercy," " when we assemble and meet together," " wherefore I pray and beseech you."
Doubtless in all these passages (as in the lines of Aeschylus) an acute grammarian might detect some distinction between the synonyms, but such a distinction would not be perceptible to ordinary worshippers.
It is now the turn of Aeschylus to dissect his opponents prologues, and, after a short criticism of the first two lines of the Antigone of Euripides (which is perhaps sufficiently discussed in the Commentary), he propounds his famous ληκύθιον test.
Euripides was fond of commencing his plays, as we have already observed, with an historical narrative, which was occasionally prefaced by some philosophical apophthegms;
and Aeschylus proposes to show that as a rule, within the first three lines, the words ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν, or άριονἀπώλεσεν, or θυλάκιον ἀπώλεσεν can be so tacked on as to complete the metre and complete the sense.
Euripides recites six prologues, and in each of them, before three lines are over, the words ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν fit in exactly as Aeschylus had predicted.
We may well believe that the tacking of this formula to the well-known prologues of Euripides produced an irresistibly comic effect;
an effect so lasting that the 1 trochaic dimeter catalectic—the section of the line displaced by the words ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν—was thenceforth named by metrical writers the 2 Εὐριπίδειον or Ληκύθιον.
Commentators have disquieted themselves in vain to determine the real defect at which Aristophanes is aiming;
for there is no real defect;
the criticism is merely comic.
Some indeed have supposed him to be ridiculing the constant break in the line after the first 2½ feet:
but this is out of the question.
No break is more common or more harmonious than this, and it would be difficult to cite any set of iambic trimeters in which it does not occur.
In the first twenty lines of the humenides it is found no less than eighteen times.
And indeed the prologue of that tragedy affords a very happy example for the application of this tag.
It begins-With this the prologue competition concludes, and we now proceed to the third question.
Euripides, as usual, is on the alert, and eager to commence the fray.
He puts in two ways the case he is going to make.
He will display the sameness of his rival's metres (αὐτὸνἀποδείξω κακὸ Μελοποιὸν ὄντα
Κat ποιοῦντα ταὔτ' ἀεί).
And again, he will cut down all his metres to one (εἰς ἓν γὰρ αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ μέλη ξυντεμῶ).
What then is this particular metre which is so continually cropping up in the Choral Odes of Aeschylus ?
Now we know that Aeschylus was, to adopt Mr. Keble's 1 felicitous phrase, " Tragoedorum Atticorum 'Ομηρικώταος."
And he himself described his tragedies as " slices cut from Homer's mighty feast."
And we cannot wonder therefore if the roll of the Homeric hexameter was always sounding in his mind, and constantly reproducing itself in his choral measures.
And this is, in truth, the charge which Euripides is bringing against him.
In whatever metre the lyrics of Aeschylus may commence, says his rival, yon are sure to find them, sooner or later, assuming the form of the Homeric hexameter.
The one standard to which the lyrics of Aeschylus are to be cut down is -ενος προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς 'Αχιλλεὺς, or, to use the line which Aristophanes either invented himself, or, more probably, was fortunate enough to find ready-made to his hand in the Myrmidons of Aeschylus,Euripides therefore selects five lines from the choral odes of Aeschylus— one from each of the following tragedies, the Myrmidons, the Psychagogi, the Telephus, the Priestesses, and the Agamemnon-and shows that the last twelve syllables of each are in the exact metre of the standard, ἰὴ κοπον, οὺ πελάθεις ἐπ'ἀρωγάν.
To make this perfectly clear, he repeats the standard after each selected line.
The standard is really an Homeric hexameter which has dropped its first foot, and all but the last syllable of the second.
It so happens that its own first syllable is short, ῐη̄, so that it represents an hexameter in which the second foot is a dactyl.
And consequently, in each of the five selected lines the corresponding syllable is short.
This first batch of lines, στάσις μελῶν, therefore bear out, so far as they go, the allegation of Euripides.
However they commence, they all conclude with the exact twelve syllables of the standard.
But he will not rest content with this;
he will give another batch, έτἑραν στάσιν μελῶν.
The plan of repeating the standard after every selected line might easily grow δι' ὄχλου rots θεωμένοις.
Euripides therefore discards it;
he calls his second series of lines κιθαρῳδικὰ, not because, in the tragedies of Aeschylus, they differed in this respect from the former series;
but because, whilst lie had recited the former to the music of the αὐλὸς, he is about to recite these to the music of the lyre, which is represented by the refrain τὸ φλαττ
οθραττοφλαττόθρατ.
And as he does not now introduce the standard ἰὴ κόπον ov πελάθεις ἐπ'
ἀρωγὰν, so lie no longer keeps to the rule of having the first syllable short.
It may now represent an hexameter which has a spondee, as well as one which has a dactyl, in the second place.
This batch contains four lines (for line 1294 may be disregarded), viz. two from the Agamemnon, one from the Sphinx, and one from an unnamed tragedy.
Here then are nine instances in which the metrical system occurs in the choruses of Aeschylus.
Euripides might easily have increased the number.
Three of the nine instances are taken from the first chorus of the Agamemnon;
and, at the risk of being tedious, I will here set down a list of the instances which I have noticed in that immortal song.
LineLineWe find therefore in this one chorus, of course a very exceptional case, and indeed within 120 lines of the chorus, the standard measure occurring twenty-six times, if not oftener.
And I have omitted every instance (unless indeed the first example be an offender in this respect) in which the close of the measure does not coincide with the close of a word.
Euripides having finished his criticism, Dionysus demands of Aeschylus whence he derived the incriminated metre, for of course, on the lips of Dionysus, the expression τὸ φλαττόθρατ signifies not the music of the lyre, but the verses to which that music had formed the accompaniment.
And Aeschylus replies that he had transplanted it from one fair soil to another, in TOV καλοῦ ἐς τὸ καλὸν, meaning, from the Homeric epos to the Athenian drama.
There was doubtless nothing Homeric in the lays of Phrynichus.
In drawing his inspiration, therefore, from the wells of Homer, Aeschylus was striking out a new and independent line, not following in the steps of his predecessor;
not δρέπων, to use his own language, τὸν αὐτὸν Φρυνίχῳ Λειμῶνα Μουσῶν.
In truth the recurrence of these Homeric echoes imparts an unequalled grandeur and dignity to the Choral Odes of Aeschylus;
but if it were otherwise, if it is to be treated as a defect, it is certainly shown to exist;
and possibly no other peculiarity of these odes is more prominent, or more easily assailable by Aristophanic humour.
It is therefore really wonderful that every commentator, without a single exception, should have contrived to ignore the real point of the criticism which Aristophanes takes such pains to elucidate, and have supposed that Euripides was concocting an ode, or rather two odes, in the manner of Aeschylus;
each ode being a cento of lines taken at random, without any special metrical purpose, from the latter's Choral Odes.
Of the first supposed cento (that is, the first batch of selected lines) they can make nothing;
it is admittedly nonsensical;
ridiculus ille cento, it is called by Brunck and Dindorf.
But in the second supposed cento they fancy themselves able dimly to descry a sort of ponderous and unmeaning sentence, which they imagine to be a carica- ture of the complex stanzas with which we occasionally meet in the choruses of Aeschylus.
Several have essayed to translate it.
Quomodo Achivorum geminum imperium, Hellenicae pubis, Sphingem tristificam, rectorem canem, mittit cum hasta et manu vindice impetuosus ales, incidere faciens in audaces canes aera pervagantes (I omit the phlattothrats).
—Brunck.
Quo- modo Achivorum duplex imperium, Graecae juventutis Sphingem, monstrum infortunio praefectum, mittat (Trojam) cum hasta et manu ultrice bellicosus ales (aquila), qui ad pruendam praebuit audacibus avibus in aere volantibus phalangem Ajacis.
—Fritzsche.
How the ominous bird of war sends forth with spear and vengeful hand the twin sovereignty of the Achaeans, Sphinx of the chivalry of Hellas, foul fiend dispenser of disasters, granting to-the eager soaring vultures to find their prey.
—Merry.
"We are presented," says Mr. Mitchell, " with a long sentence, in which the nominative case is thrown to a most awkward distance, the accusative presenting itself in the front of the sentence, and the interval offering all the peculiarities of Aeschylean style-bold and dithyrambic diction, harsh appositions and metonyms, and even appositions doubly apposited."
Fritzsche indeed does not agree with Aristophanes that Euripides is endeavouring " to show that all Aeschylean metres are identical,” and “ to cut them down to one," His opinion is quite different.
“ Ostensurus est Euripides Aeschylo obscuritatem rectissime objici solere."
Without citing other commentators it is sufficient to say that every one of them, from the scholiast downwards, takes the same view of Euripides' objection.
All this criticism is based upon an entire delusion.
There is no “ long sentence" here ;
there is no " cento."
The lines are brought forward as individual specimens, each complete in itself, to be tried by the test of the standard measure ;
and have no more connexion with each other than had the various prologues of Euripides brought forward in the preceding encounter.
Exactly the same hallucination has prevailed with regard to the counter-criticism which Aeschylus proceeds to apply to the metres of Euripides.
Here too, several isolated passages, seven in number, are selected for the purpose of showing, in each of them, some metrical irregularity or variation.
Here too, the commentators, with one accord, persist in huddling all these seven isolated passages into a “ cento " (in supposed imitation of an ode of Euripides) which they vainly endeavour to construe.
Here too, there is no " center and no construction.
Each of the seven selected passages is intended to be judged, by itself, on its own merits.
But this misconception is far more excusable than the former.
Aristophanes does not point out here, as he did there, the particular irregularities intended to be assailed.
Nor are we sufficiently familiar with the metres themselves to determine with certainty in what these irregularities consist, especially as the later writers on metre form their canons on the practice of all the great poets, and consequently look upon the variations introduced by Euripides as regular metrical forms.
And certainly I have no confidence whatever in my own ability to point out, in each or any case, the defect, or supposed defect, at which Aeschylus is aiming his criticism.
Doubtless, on the stage, the impeached metre was made perfectly plain by the voice and manner of the actor.
However, I will set down my ideas on the subject in the hope that they may be corrected by competent scholars.
It seems to me, then, that the criticism is directed against the variations introduced into three metres, the Choriambic, the Glyconic, and the Paeonic ;
variations, it should be remembered, which would be considered defects by those only who would restrict the tragic choruses to austere and simple metrical forms.
Variations of this kind are freely admitted in the lyric metres of comedy.
The seven passages which Aristophanes selects are as follows.
The letters C, G, and P placed against some of the lines are intended to assist the reader in ascertaining the character and locality of the supposed defect.
Let us consider the variations which Euripides has in these passages introduced intoThe pure cboriambic dimeter of course consists of two choriambs, As a specimen of this metre, Gaisford, in his notes to Hephaestion, cites the following passage from the Bacchae :
—
But the metre is rarely found in this pure form I.
As a rule, an iambic dipody is substituted for one of the two choriambs;
thus This is the ordinary and regular metre.
Let us see how Euripides varies it.
Four instances are given, in each of which the choriamb concludes the line, as in form (a) supra.
In passage (1), line 4, and also in passage (6), line 2, each iamb is changed into a tribrach, ρ̒ανίσι χρόαδρυσ- and βότρυος ἕλικα,In passage (3) the first iamb is changed into a dactyl, κερκίδος.A glyconic line may be best described as consisting of a 2 choriamb, preceded by a dissyllabic base (of any quantity), and followed by a single iambHephaestion (chap. x) gives the following example :
—when that terribly-raging boar slew with mastiff-destroying tusk Aphrodite's delight and joy.
The metre is very common in both Greek and 1 Roman poetry;
and in the passages we are now considering there are three unimpeachable glyconic lines, viz.
But there are two other lines in which the incriminated irregularities may be discovered.
In passage (4), line 1, the base is changed into a tribach, ἳv' ὸφἵλ-.
In passage (7) it becomes an anapaest περίβαλλ
̕This metre, I may observe in passing, is the favourite metre of Aris- tophanes in his earlier comedies.
A paeonic line, as a rule, ends with a cretic foot, — –v v v | — ^—|In passage (1), line 1, Euripides makes it end with an iambic dipodý, -νάοιςθαλάσ- |.For take away, he says, the base and the iamb, which he considers mere excrescences, and then Solum Pierides manet, Quod dicunt Choriambicum.
Here there are two paeons.
Passage (2), line 3, is exactly the same, except that it has only one paeon.
We thus see that in every one of the seven selected passages there is at least one deviation from the regular metre.
This then is the sum of the metrical contest.
The charge which Euripides brings against Aeschylus is that he habitually introduced into his odes the greater part of an Homeric hexameter.
The charge which Aeschylus brings against Euripides is that he habitually introduced variations into the solemn and carefully regulated metres of ancient tragedy.
In each case the charge is fully proven;
but in each case, whether the peculiarity charged was really a defect or a merit, is a ques- tion on which opinions might naturally be expected to differ.
But though the metrical contest is now concluded, Aeschylus will not part with the general question of tragic odes, without giving a caricature of the Monody, or Lyrical Monologue, which was a special feature of the plays of Euripides.
Here we find all the splendour of mythical imagery thrown around, not some great and heroic event, but a simple and homely incident of everyday life.
A poor spinning-girl has lost her domestic cock, and wishes to search the cottage of her neighbour Glyce, whom she suspects of stealing it.
That is all.
But it is sung in strains which might befit a falling dynasty or some tremendous catastrophe of nations.
The girl has seen an awful vision of the night, a terrible portent, which " shakes her breast with vague alarms.""
She describes it in really blood-curdling terms.
What can it mean, this vision from the unseen world ?
What soul-thrilling calamity can it portend ?
It is like the vision of Clytaemnestra in the Choephoroe, or the vision of Atossa in the Persae.
And, like a tragedy queen, the girl bids her maidens draw from the running water, to wash away the evil omens of her dream.
Suddenly the true interpretation of the dream flashes upon her.
GLYCE HAS STOLEN HER COCK.
This, nothing less than this, is the catastrophe which the terrible dream portends.
Alas for the overwhelming calamity which has fallen upon her unawares !
But soon her sorrow changes into wrath.
She will go forth and search the cottage of Glyce.
And she calls upon Artemis the huntress to come with her supernatural hounds to trace the missing cockerel, and upon Hecate of the moon to pour her brightest rays into the darksome recesses of her neighbours house.
And in good truth, however broad the caricature, the Monody does really touch the one striking and inevitable blot of the Euripidean drama.
The poet's aim was to paint men and women as they really were, as he saw them around him in everyday life;
whilst the inflexible rules of the Attic stage compelled him to select his characters from amongst the 1 mighty personages of legendary and heroic times.
This was no hardship to Aeschylus, whose mind was cast in the Homeric mould, and whose Agamemnon, for instance, was not an Athenian of the Peloponnesian War, but the very king of men, whom Homer sang.
But the more completely Euripides succeeded in portraying the smart- ness and loquacity of contemporary life, the less were his characters fit to wear the armour, and speak the language, of demigods and heroes.
So strangely arc the commentators fascinated -with the idea of a "cento," that there are some who even in this Monody would fain descry a "cento" of Euripidean passages.
No suggestion can be further from the truth.
It is as original as anything in Aristophanes :
though in composing a parody of a Euripidean monologue he would of course imitate as closely as he could that poet's language, and style, and repro- duce, if not exaggerate, his peculiar mannerisms, such as his musical shakes (εἰειειειειειλίσσονσα), and his reduplication of words, φόνια φόνιαWhich of the competitors wrote the weightiest verses?
This is the last subject for discussion :
and to determine it by weighing their verses in a pair of scales is of course to present in a merely laughable form a topic rather minute in itself, but perhaps not altogether unworthy of more serious consideration.
With this the literary competition concludes:
and all at once, by a transformation scene as sudden and complete as that which brought the literary competition on the stage, we find ourselves retransferred to the earlier aspect of the play.
The question now becomes, not which of the two is the better tragedian and shall occupy the Chair of Tragedy in the world below, but which -of them can give the wiser political counsel to the state, and shall reascend with Dionysus to the world above.
We have already, in the earlier part of this Introduction, touched upon the counsel which Aristophanes, through the lips of Aeschylus and the favourable verdict of Dionysus, now tenders to the assembled Athenians, viz. that Alcibiades shall be recalled, and the whole wealth of the state expended upon the fleet.
And although we know, on the great authority of Dicaearchus, that it was to the advice given in the Parabasis that the play owed its exceptional favour, yet it is impossible to doubt that such advice was regarded not as a mere isolated event, but as the crown and culmination of that noble and exalted1 patriotism which breathed through the entire comedy, and indeed had sustained the poet throughout the whole of his career.
This was probably the last counsel which he ever had an opportunity of offering to Imperial Athens.
The plays which contended with the Frogs for the prize were the " Muses " of Phrynichus, which was placed second, and the " Cleophon " of Plato, which was placed last.
The poets of the Old Comedy mostly dealt with subjects which were, at the moment, attracting the attention of the public :
and it is therefore natural that occasionally the same topics should be introduced, and the same persons assailed, in more than one of the comedies exhibited at the same Dionysia.
We know that when the Peace was exhibited the tragedian Melanthius was held up to ridicule in each of the three com- peting comedies.
The Birds, and the Μονόροπος of Phrynichus, were produced at the same festival, and in each of them allusions were made to Execestides, Syracosius, and the military contrivances of Nicias.
And it seems that each comedy which competed with the Frogs concurred in some part of its criticism.
It is probable that the "Muses" of Pbrynichus was concerned with the poet Euripides;
it is certain that the " Cleophon " of Plato was a satire on that pernicious demagogue who is more than once attacked in the comedy before us.
I have already 1 intimated my dissent from Meineke's theory that the " Muses " contained a poetical contest between Euripides and Sophocles, similar to that contained in the Frogs between Euripides and Aeschylus;
and my belief that if the play dealt with Euripides at.
all, it treated him as a culprit on his trial, for his offences against the art of tragedy.
Apart from the shortness of the time which had elapsed since the death of Sophocles, and the intrinsic improbability that the two poets should have framed their plays on such precisely similar lines, it seems to me that the very fragment which Meineke adduces in support of his theory is really decisive against it.
Photius, S. V. καδίσκος. Lo, here the vote, and there the verdict-urns, This the condemning, that the absolving one.
Is it not clear that this is the case of a prisoner on his trial, and not of two rival poets contending for victory ?
The Muses were probably the Chorus of the play, and were accusing Euripides before Dionysus, or some other judge, of having lowered the standard of tragedy.
In the “ Muses," as in the Frogs, there is an allusion to the very recent death of Sophocles ;
-
The speaker would seem to be contrasting the peaceful passing away of Sophocles from old age with the cruel death of Euripides who, we are told, was torn to pieces in Macedonia by a pack of savage dogs.
Cleophon doubtless owes to his outrageous folly, a few months before, the distinction of being immortalized at this festival by both Aris- tophanes and Plato.
After the battle of Arginusae, Athens had her last chance of emerging in safety from the Peloponnesian War.
The Lace- daemonians offered to evacuate Deceleia and conclude a general peace, on the terms that each side should retain what it then held.
The wiser citizens were naturally anxious to embrace the offer, but the 1 populace, inflamed by the frenzy of Cleophon, rejected it altogether.
On that occasion, according to.
Aristotle, he appeared in the assembly tipsy and wearing a military breastplate.
And Aeschines adds that he threatened to chop off the head of any one who dared even to speak of peace.
To such a depth of degradation had the " leadership of the Demus," held by Pericles at the commencement of the war, descended before its con- clusion.
It is in reference to this disastrous policy that Aristophanes bids Cleophon, if he wants fighting, go back to his 1 native country and fight there.
By his native country" he means Thrace, from which barbarian land he was said, on his mothers side, to derive his origin.
And Plato 2 also, in his comedy, described him as a Thracian, and intro- duced his mother, speaking a barbarian dialect.
It is said by the Scholiast on Euripides that the poet intended the following lines of the Orestes to be a description of Cleophon :
—
The Orestes was exhibited three years before the Frogs, but we know that this ignoble demagogue had retained for many years 4 the control of all the affairs of the state.
Several excellent translations of the Frogs in English verse have been published;
but hardly any of them give the play in its entirety.
The most notable are those by Charles Dunster, A.D. 1785 ;
the Right Honourable John Hookham Frere, A.D. 1839;
Sir Charles Cavendish Clifford, A.D. 1848;
Leonard Hampson Rudd, A.D. 1867;
the Rev. Alfred Davies Cope, A.D. 1895 ;
and the Rev. Edward Wynn Hunting- ford, A.D. 1900.
I think that I have made only two alterations of any importance in the text, and they are in the admittedly corrupt lines 1028 and 1301.

I cordially thank their distinguished author for allowing me to insert them here:
-"
In reading the Frogs of Aristophanes, written fifty years after the death of Aeschylus, we see his place in Athenian memory.
That comedy is an inestimable document, of which the historical value is not impaired by the free play of humour and of fancy ;
it is nearer, both in time and in spirit, to the age of Aeschylus, and is far more instructive, than any other document that we possess.
There we catch an echo of the sweet lyrics of Phrynichus—of those ' native wood-notes wild ' which he had warbled as if the birds had taught him—a music dying away in the distance of that century's earliest years-the lyrics of which elderly men had heard their fathers speak with delight.
And there, too, rises before us a living image of the majestic poet who had come after Phrynichus, the poet who.
first of the Hellenes, had built up a stately diction for Tragedy, and also invested it with external grandeur;
the poet who had described the battle of Salamis as he had seen it;
whose lofty verse had been inspired by the wish to nourish the minds of his fellow-citizens with ennobling ideals, to make them good men and true, worthy of their fathers and their city;
the poet to whom many an Athenian, sick at heart with the decay of patriotism and with the presage of worse to come, looked back, amidst regret for the recent loss of Sophocles and Euripides, as to one who had been not only the creator of the Attic drama, but also in his own person an embodiment of that manly and victorious Athens which was for ever passing away." Pp. 184, 185."
The wit of Aristophanes often packs a great deal of sound criticism into a few words.
His Euripides says that, when he received Tragedy from Aeschylus, it was* plethoric, swollen, and heavy.
He treated it for this malady, giving it decoctions which reduced it to a leaner but more healthy state.
Then he proceeded to feed it up again, with such a stimulating diet as monodies.
There is a biting truth in this mockery..
Euripides had to apply the principle of compensation.
The heroic had to be replaced by the sensational.
In attempting to estimate the work of Euripides, we must indeed guard against allowing too much weight to the verdict of Attic Comedy;
but neither can we ignore it.
It is necessary to apprehend the point of view from which this contemporary satire assailed him, and the grounds on which it based its unfavourable judgement.
If we then proceed to modify that judgement in the light of a larger survey, we shall do so with less fear of erring through modern misconception.
Thp hostility of Aristophanes to Euripides was certainly bitter;
nor can it surprise us, if he believed Euripides to have done all the mischief with which he charges him.
But Aristophanes was not the only comic poet who attacked Euripides.
There was a deeper reason for this than any individual or personal sentiment.
Attic Comedy had a natural quarrel with the innovator in Tragedy, and the ground of this lay in its own history.
Sicily is one of two regions in which the origin of Comedy is to be sought;
the other is Athens.
The Dorians, both in Sicily and in Greece Proper, early showed a bent towards farcical humour;
an the case of the Siceliots, there may have been some Italic influences at work, since it has always been an Italic gift to seize those traits of life and character which suit farce and burlesque.
At the courts of the Sicilian princes such entertainments were welcome.
The Dorian Epicharmus, from the Sicilian Megara, was the first who developed the ruder farce into a species of dramatic poetry.
This was done at Syracuse, where the tragic poets Phrynichus and Aeschylus had been the guests of Hieron ;
and Attic Tragedy may have suggested the general idea of the form which Epi- charmus adopted, though he does not seem to have used a Chorus.
Athens, during the same period-the first half of the fifth century B.C.— developed a comic drama from a different source.
At the Dionysia, when the people were assembled to worship the god and to see tragedy, the merry procession called a comus had become a recognized feature of the festival.
It was at first a voluntary and unofficial affair.
One or more troops of men dressed themselves up in mummers' costume, and marched into the sacred precinct to the music of the flute.
They then sang a song in honour of Dionysus ;
and one of their number addressed the audience in a humorous speech, turning on civic interests and on the topics of the day.
The festal procession then withdrew again.
The name Comedy, κωμωδία, originally denoted this Song of the Comus,' and was doubtless coined at Athens, on the analogy of tragoedia.
About B. c. 465 the comus was adopted into the official programme of the festival:
instead of being the voluntary work of private persons, it was now organized with aid from the State.
The steps by which a dramatic performance was built up around the comus-song and speech can no longer be traced.
But some five-and-thirty years later, at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, Attic Comedy, as we know it, was mature.
Tragedy naturally furnished the general model on which the new kind of drama was constructed.
This is apparent in the limit placed on the number of actors;
no extant play of Aristophanes requires more than three regular actors, allowance being made for small parts being taken by supernumeraries who were not required to be absolutely mute.
But Comedy was connected with Tragedy by much more than this kinship of form.
Comedy expressed the frolic- some side of that Dionysiac worship from which Tragedy took its birth.
Religion, the religion of Dionysus, was the breath of life to Comedy, not less-perhaps even more-than to her grave sister.
It was religion that authorized the riot of fancy which turns the world topsy-turvy, the jest upon all things Olympian or human, the unsparing personal satire.
Let that popular religion once lose its hold, and then, though Tragedy might survive, Comedy, such as Aristophanes wrote, must lose its sacred privileges, and, with them, its reason for existing.
By the first law of its being, the Old Comedy was the sworn foe of all things which could undermine the sway of Dionysus, the god who not only inspires the poet, but protects his liberties.
And the nearer Tragedy stood to the original form which the Dionysiac cult had given to it, the closer was the kinship which Comedy felt with it.
For this reason Aeschylus represents, even better than Sophocles, the form of Tragedy with which the muse of Aristophanes was in spiritual accord ;
and Euripides represents everything which that muse abhors.
Euripides, who dwarfs the heroic stature, and profanes heroic lips with the rhetoric of the ecclesia or the law-court;
Euripides, with his rationalism, his sophistry, his proclivity to new-fangled notions of every kind-here Comedy, with sure instinct, saw a dramatist who was using the Dionysia against the very faith to which that festival was devoted, and whose poetry was the subtle solvent by which Comedy and Tragedy alike were destined to perish.
It was a happy fortune that, before its short life came to an end, the essence of Attic Comedy was so perfectly expressed by the great satirist who was also a great poet.
The genius of Aristophanes indeed transcends the form in which he worked ;
but it exhibits all the varied capabilities of that form.
He can denounce a corrupt demagogue or an unworthy policy with a stinging scorn and a force of righteous indignation which make the poet almost forgotten in the patriot.
He can use mockery with the lightest touch.
But it is not in denunciation or in banter that his most exquisite faculty is revealed.
It is rather in those lyric passages where he soars above everything that can move laughter or tears, and pours forth a strain of such free, sweet music and such ethereal fancy as it would be hard to match save in Shakespeare.
A poet who united such gifts brought keen insight and fine taste to the task of the critic.
In reading the Frogs, we do not forget that it is a comedy, not a critical essay.
And we allow for the bias against Euripides.
But no careful student of the play can fail to admire how Aristophanes seizes the essential points in the controversy between the two schools of Tragedy.
When Aeschylus has said that a poet ought to edify, Euripides rejoins (in effect), ' Are you edifying when you indulge in dark grandiloquence, instead of explaining yourself in the language of ordinary humanity ?'
Now observe the rejoinder of Aeschylus.
He replies, ' Great sentiments and great thoughts are suitably clothed in stately words.
Besides, it is natural that the demigods (τοὺς ἡμιθέους) should have grandeur of words ;
for their clothes are much grander than ours.
I exhibited all this properly-and you have utterly spoiled it.'
Here Aristophanes has put the true issue in a simple form.
Aeschylus is right in vindicating his own style, and condemning his rival's, by an appeal to the nature of his subject-matter.
Heroes and demigods ought not to speak like ordinary men.
He is right, too, when he enforces his point by referring to the stately costume which he had devised for Tragedy.
This was a visible symbol of the limit set to realism.
When Aristophanes passes from the ground of art to that of ethics, the justice of his criticism may be less evident to moderns, but here also he is substantially right from the Athenian point of view.
His Aeschylus complains that Euripides had sapped the springs of civic manliness, of patriotism, and even of morality.
It is true that Euripides, . as a dramatic poet, had contributed to tendencies setting in that direction.
Homer had been regarded by the Greeks as their greatest teacher, because the heroes were the noblest ideals of human life which they possessed.
Aeschylus and Sophocles, in their different ways, had preserved the Homeric spirit.
If the heroes once ceased to be ideals of human life, the ordinary Greek of the fifth century had no others.
To depose the heroes from their elevation above commonplace humanity was also to destroy an indispensable link between god and man in the popular religion.
But that religion was at the root of the Greek citizen's loyalty to the city.
In the smaller details of his polemic against Euripides, the comic poet is sometimes acute and just, sometimes excessively unfair.
We are not here concerned with such details.
The broad facts which claim our attention are simply these.
Attic Comedy, as such, was the natural foe of a tragic poet like Euripides.
Aristophanes clearly understood the artistic limits proper to Attic Tragedy.
He clearly saw where and how Euripides had transgressed them ;
he also saw that this error of Euripides in art was, for the Athens of his day, inseparable from a bad moral influence.
And Aristophanes can sum up his judgement by saying that Euripides, in pursuing new refinements, had abandoned the greatest things (ra μέγιστα) of the Tragic Art-as Athens had known it." Pp. 225-233.In the MSS.
the Frogs are described as βατράχων παραχορήγημα,_ and so in most of the editions.
But this is plainly an erroneous description.
The scene disclosed by the fall of the curtain represents no special locality.
It might with propriety be entitled
On the road to Hades.
A house in the back- ground is the residence of Heracles.
Two travellers are seen entering on the stage, one riding on a donkey, the other walking by his side.
The pedestrian is Dionysus, the patron deity of theatrical performances, who, in addition to the yellow robe and buskins which formed part of his ordinary attire, has assumed for the nonce the formidable club and lion's skin of Heracles.
The rider is his slave Xanthias, who is carrying on a pole over his shoulder the στρώματα, rugs, wrappers and the like, a traveller's ordinary luggage.
As they enter, Xan- thias is inquiring whether he may em- ploy the well-worn buffooneries whereby theatrical slaves and other burden- bearers were accustomed to excite the laughter of the audience.
Dionysus prohibits four expressions only, πιέζοαι, θλίβομα, ητιαω,and ἀποπαδησοαι.
Xanthias complains that this exhausts the whole apparatus of humour, with which other comic poets (rivals of Aristophanes) were wont to endow their burden-bearers.
We must not suppose that because Aristophanes satirizes his rivals for using these popular buffoon- eries, he did not use them himself when occasion arose.
The Scholiast quotes one example from the second Thesmo- phoriazusae:
XANTHIAS.
Shall I crack any of those old jokes, master, At which the audience never fail to laugh ?
DIONYSUS.
Aye, what you will, except I'm getting crushed:
Fight shy of that:
I'm sick of that already.
XAN.
Nothing else smart ?
Dio,
Aye, save my shoulder's aching.
XAN.
Come now, that comical joke ?
Dio.
With all my heart.
Only be careful not to shift your pole,And Bergler adds Knights 998 and Lysistrata 254, 314.
And possibly one object of this very dialogue was to lend fresh piquancy to these well-worn jests when introduced by Xanthias, infra 20 and 30, in defiance of his master's pro- hibition.
4. χολή]
For it (the πιέζομαι joke) is by this time absolutely gall to me:
that is, as bitter as gall;
" felle amarior, non melle dulcior," says Fritzsche, referring to Horace's Hoc iuvat, et melli est," Satires, ii. 6. 32 and (after Dindorf) to Phrynichus, Bekk. p. 73, 1, χολή ἐστιν .
Dionysus has already had more than enough of this jest, and is heartily sick of it.
The Scholiast's explanation, ὰντὶ TOV πολύ.
TO δὲ πολὺ, κὰν ή γλνκὺ, πονηρὸν, is perhaps inspired by the Epigram which Dr. Blaydes cites from the An- thology :

Something must be supplied in both question and answer.
In the former we must understand έὶπω as in lines 1 and 6.
Am I not to say any other choice witticism?
The latter im- plies a general permission, like the νὴ τον ∆ἵ ὄΤL βούλει ye of line 3, qualified only by the further exception πλήν y' ώς θλίβομαι.
The irresistibly funny jest, τὸ itάνυ γέλοιον, of the next line is not disclosed in words, but was doubtless sufficiently indicated by the gestures ofXanthias.
Probably it was one of the vulgarities prohibited in the succeeding lines, since notwithstanding his mas- ter's apparent acquiescence, we find Xanthias complaining, infra 13, of not being allowed to crack any one of his jokes.

Phrynichus and Ameipsias were old rivals of Aristo- phanes.
Ameipsias was a competitor in the famous contest of 423 B.C. :
and although the prize was awarded to the Flagon of Cratinus, yet the Connos of Ameipsias was also placed before the Clouds of Aristophanes.
Nine years later, the Birds of Aristophanes was sandwiched in between the Revellers of Ameipsias, which gained the prize, and the Solitary (6 Movότροπος) of Phry- nichus, which was placed last.

Throughout this opening scene, and indeed generally throughout the play, Dionysus speaks rather as an Athenian critic than as the patron deity of theatrical perform- ances.
With the particular phrase in the text, Dobree compares Cymbeline, i. 2, " Thou heapest a year's age on me."20. θλίβεται]
These restrictions are too much for Xanthias, who at once lets off one of the prohibited words.
is a wine jar.
A σταμνίον of Thasian wine is brought on the stage in the Lysistrata.26. βαρέως πάνυ]
Scorning the vulgar jokes with which theatrical slaves were accustomed to divert an Athenian audi- ence, Dionysus, like the true Euripidean enthusiast which he presently avows himself to be, endeavours to engage his slave in no little sophistical controversy.
It is the donkey, he argues, which is carrying both Xanthias and the luggage ;
and if it be the donkey which is carrying the luggage, it cannot be Xanthias who is carrying it.
Xanthias, though unable to refute the argument, is nevertheless perfectly satisfied by the evidence of his senses, or in other words by the aching of his shoulder, that he himself is some- how or other carrying the luggage ;
and when Dionysus repeats the question, " How are you carrying it ?" τίνα τρόπον [φέρεις ο̃ς γ';
], he evades the ques- tion by replying βαρέως φέρω, an ex- pression which of course, like the Latin graviter fero, merely expresses his mental attitude towards the business (infra 803, Wasps 158, and passim) and has nothing whatever to do with the physical problem with which Dionysus is perplexing him.
In endeavouring to emphasize this play of words in the translation, I have been unable to preserve that which follows in the next line, where Dionysus from the adverb βαρέως (in the sense of mental heaviness) deduces the substantive βαρος in the sense of physical heaviness.

Xanthias cannot solve the puzzle, but he can, and does, avenge himself by producing another of the prohibited jokes.33. έναυμάχουν]

In which case he would have received enfranchisement, and been as good a man as his master.
As to the enfranchisement of the slaves who fought in that great battle, see the remarks in the Introduction, and the notes on 191 infra and on the Epir- rhema.35.
κατάβα, πανοῦργε]
Xanthias dis- mounts, and the donkey disappears from the play.38.
τίς τὴν θύραν ]
Heracles, aroused by the violence with which Dionysus is battering at his door, a violence which reminds him of his old antagonists the Centaurs, is heard talking to himself within.
When at last he opens the door, and sees no redoubtable athlete, but only the comical little figure of Dionysus, he pauses for a moment in dumb amazement (which the other mistakes for alarm), and finally breaks out into uncontrollable fits of Homeric laughter.41.
μὴ μαίνοιο]
The words ὡς σφόδρα μ'ἔδεισε are employed by Dionysus in their ordinary sense, How terribly afraid of me he was!
But in the sentence as completed by Xanthias, σφόδρα σ' ἔδεισε μὴ μαίνοιο the accusative has, lost its meaning and (by a very common Greekidiom) merely represents the nominative before the following verb, he was terribly afraid that you were out of your senses.
So in Plutus 684, 5, when Cario is re- counting to his mistress the scene in the Temple of Asclepius, and how he himself made for a pot of porridge which was standing near his pallet, " Miserable man," cries the lady, "were you not afraid of the God ?" ταλάντατ ἀνδρῶν, οὐκ ἐδεδοίκεις τὸν θεόν ;
"In troth was I," says Cario, "lest he should get to the porridge before I did," νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς ἔγωγε μὴ φθάσειέ με 'Επὶ τὴν χύτραν ἐλθών, Cf. Clouds 493 ;
St. Paul to the Galatians iv.
11. The idiom is often adopted by our old writers, " I see you what you are:
you are too proud," Twelfth Night, i. 5 ;
King Lear, i. 1, though probably they borrowed it from the New Testament phrase "I know thee what thou art," which again is merely a literal translation of the Greek.

λεοντη̑.—Scholiast.
With the λεοντη̑ of course went the ῥόπαλον :
with the κρο- κωτὸς the κόθορνος.
Warned perhaps by the difficulties which Dionysus en- countered in the present play, Lucian's Menippus, when bound on a similar expedition (Necyom. 8), assumed, to- gether with the λεοντῆ of Heracles, the symbols of Orpheus and Odysseus, so that he might at his pleasure represent whichever of the three would from time to time be likely to obtain the most favourable reception.ἐπεβάτευον would naturally mean " I went as an ἐπιβάτης or marine on," and the audience would expect the name of aHER.

ship to follow, ἐπὶ τῆ Νίκη, "on the Victory," or the like :
but the addition, Trapa προσδακίαν, of Κλεισθένει at once diverts the meaning of ἐπιβατεύειν into the second and grosser alternative recog- nized by the Scholiast.
Some have idly supposed that Κλεισθένης may have really been the name of a ship, which is of course impossible.
All Athenian ships bore feminine names ;
Schömann collects about 150, De nominibus navium Opus- cula, i. 301;
though indeed a comic poet might suggest that Cleisthenes would not be disqualified by that restriction.
But in disposing of this notion, Schö- mann himself seems to have fallen into an error of equal magnitude by attri- buting to the words ἐπιβατεύειν Κλεισθένει a signification which they cannot possibly bear, viz.
τριηράρχῳ ὡς ἐπιβάτην προστε- τάχθαι, and indeed Dobree had antici- pated him in this suggestion.
But though a marine might rightly be described as an ἐπιβάτης of this or that general, or possibly of this or that trierarch, he could not be said ἐπι- βατεύειν τριηράρχῳ.
The object of this suggestion is to find a "marine" allu- sion in the two words conjoined :
but in truth that allusion, though renewed in the following verse, is for the moment destroyed by the unexpected addition of Κλεισθένει.
Of Cleisthenes, whose vile and effeminate vices had been lashed by Aristophanes for (at least) twenty years, we shall hear again infra 422, and again in the same degraded character.

And were you in the sea-battle ?
that is, in the battle of Argi- nusae ?
as Mitchell rightly interprets it, the verb ναυμαχεῖν being by itself sufficient, here as supra 33, to indicate the great ναυμαχία which was at this moment in all minds.
The query of Heracles diverts Dionysus from the tale he was intending to tell, into a romance about his own heroic achievements on that eventful day ;
though indeed, as more than seventy " of the enemy's ships" were destroyed at Arginusae, Dionysus is rather to be commended for his moderation in claiming only twelve or thirteen as his own share.

He is referring, I think, to the pair before him, and not, as most commentators take it, to Dionysus and Cleisthenes.
It is objected that Xanthias was not present at Arginusae, but neither was Dionysus.

This is a very pleasant and interesting incident, especially if we are at liberty to infer from it that Athenian soldiers, even on ship-board, did not forget their literary pursuits.
It reminds us of those Athe- nian soldiers in Sicily who, a few years previously, had won the favour of their captors by singing songs and reciting passages from the tragedies of Euripides.
(Plutarch, Nicias, chap. 29.)
The Andro- meda was accounted in old times one of the most pathetic and beautiful of all his tragedies.
Aristophanes draws largely upon it in the Thesmophoriazusae, to which the reader is referred.
There Mnesilochus, tied to the plank, takes the part of the Princess exposed to the fury of the sea-monster, whilst Euripides first, as Echo, responds to his lamenta- tions, and then, as Perseus, endeavours to deliver him out of the hand of his enemies.
And see infra 105 and the note there.
55. Μόλων] Melon was a tragic actor of large stature (μεγαλόσωμος, Scholiast);

and possibly, in the Andromeda, he represented the doomed Princess herself, in which character his great size would have been particularly conspicuous :
a circumstance which would naturally account for his introduction here.
Ac- cording to the Scholiast, the grammarian Didymus supposed that, besides the large actor, there was also a little footpad of the name of Melon, and that the allusion here is to that little footpad.
But this would be sheer nonsense :
and it is to be feared that Didymus, misunderstand- ing the passage, evolved that little foot- pad out of his own imagination.57. ἀταταῖ]
'Αταταῖ, otherwise ἀτταταῖ and ἰἀτταταῖ, is a cry extorted by a sharp pang, generally of pain, but occasionally of pleasure or desire.
See infra 649 and the note there.
Either way, it denotes here that Heracles has touched the sore, for it was in truth a πόθος ἀνδρὸς (though not in the sense in which Heracles had used the words) that was consuming Dionysus.
Heracles, still keeping to his own meaning of the question, inquires whether it has anything to do with his relations to Cleisthenes, as inferred from 48 supra:
and is quite taken aback on discovering that it is merely a longing for " the sound of a voice that is still.

Bothe is probably right in considering the borrowed ἡμιστίχιαν to be the first half of the line ἆρ' ἐκδι- δάσκω τὸ σαφὲς, which is both Euripidean, and calculated to attract attention ;

For there was still a living Euripides, the son of the great tragedian, exhibiting his plays on the Athenian stage.

Heracles, however, thinks the proposition οἱ ὄντες, κακοὶ too sweeping a condemna- tion, for a class which includes Iophon, the son of Sophocles, and Dionysus admits Iophon to be a possible excep- tion, if indeed the plays which he has exhibited are not, altogether or in part, the handiwork of his illustrious father.
Iophon wrote many tragedies, but we are not told whether any were composed after his father's death.
76.
πρότερ
ον ]His elder in birth by fifteen years, his predecessor on the Athenian stage by thirteen years.
The recommendation to substitute Sophocles for Euripides comes in rather strangely amongst the inquiries about living poets, but it is intended to introduce the further criticism on Iophon :
κωμῳδεῖται yap ὁ 'lοφῶν, ό υἱὸς Σοφοκλέους, ὡς ra του πατρὸς λέγων ποιήματα, as the Scholiast says.
Professor Palmer suggests, and it is not improbable, that lines 76-82 formed no part of the original dialogue, written, he supposes, in the lifetime of Sophocles, but were inserted after his death.
Here then both Sophocles and Euripides are mentioned, but there is no allusion whatever to the third great poet, whom Dionysus ultimately decides to bring back from the unseen world.
83. 'Αγάθων]
Agathon, the well-known tragic poet, is one of the dramatis per- sonae in the Thesmophoriazusae, where his delicate beauty, his affectations and effeminacy, his graceful language and dainty conceits, and the social amiability which endeared him to his friends, are all sufficiently depicted.
He was at this time living at the court of Archelaus of Macedon, where, following the example of Euripides, he spent the evening of his life, and where he died some years after the production of the Frogs.
This permanent settlement of Agathon in Macedonia was (for the Dionysus of the Attic theatre) almost equivalent to his death, and is described in language which (except perhaps for the last word εὐωχίαν) would not be inappropriate to the latter event.
And therefore some early grammarians, and indeed no less a critic than Fritzsche in modern times, have imagined that Agathon was really now dead.
But this is an obvious mis- take.
All the inquiries of Heracles after tragic poets are directed to the pro- position οἱ ὄντες, κακοὶ, supra 72. τί 8';
οὐκ Ιοφῶν ξῆ ;
(73).
'Αγἁθων δὲ ποῦ'στιν ;
(83).
ό δὲ Ξενοκλέης ;
(86).
Πυθάγγελος Be ;
(87).
And in truth Heracles, him- self a denizen of the invisible world, needs no information about the dead.
He knows of the deaths of Euripides (67) and Sophocles (76), and would have known of the death of Agathon, had it occurred.
The expression ποθεινὸς φίλοις is possibly borrowed from Eur. Phoen. 320 (to which Bergler refers), where it is applied to an absent, not to a dead, man ;
whilst the phrase ἐς μακά-
ρων εύωχίαν, in the sense of " to the banquets of the wealthy," suits well with the sumptuous tables of Archelaus, of whose έστίασιν πολυτελῆ, provided for these very poets, Euripides and Agathon, we read in Aelian's V. H. xiii.

άγαθὸς ποιητής]
A good-hearted poet.
It would be as misleading to give the literal translation "a good poet" here, as it would be to translate magno amico in Jnvenal iii. 57 " your great friend" ;
since, according to our English idiom, the epithet "good" would apply to the quality of the poetry, and the epithet " great" to the warmth of the friendship, which is not the case in the original Greek and Latin.
As 'Αγάθων and ἀγαθὸς com- mence consecutive lines, there is prob- ably, as Spanheim suggests, a sort of play on the similarity of sound.
86. Ξενοκλέης]
This little tragedian, the smallest of the dwarfish sons of Carcinus, has already been ridiculed in the Wasps and the Thesmophoriazusae.
See Wasps 1509 and the notes on Wasps 1501, 1510;
Thesm.
169, 441.
Here his name is saluted merely with an execration.
Pythangelus, who is men- tioned in the following line and no- where else, is not deemed worthy of even that salutation, but is dismissed with a scornful gesture.
87.
οὐδεὶς λόγος]
No word, or as we perhaps should rather say, No thought, of me.
The same ejaculation is repeated infra 107 and 115.
The last words of Lucian's Sightseers (Χάρων ἤ 'Επισκο- ποῦντες), where Charon, personally con- ducted by Hermes, has been looking on at the varied scenes of human life, are Χάρωνος δἐ οὐδεὶς λόγος.
In a very similar strain St. Chrysostom says (Horn. xxii. in Matth.
278 B) τὰ ἔθνη έπιξητεῖ τοῦτο, οἷς ό πόνος ἄπας Kara TOV παρόντα βίον, οἷς λόγοςοὐδεὶς περὶ τῶν μελλόντων.
See Lucian's Cataplus 14 ;
Heliodorus, Aethiopics, viii. 5 ;
St. Chrys. Horn. lxviii. in Matth. (674 D), xxxix. in 1 Cor. (375 A), &c.
In the following line Xanthias gets perilously near the pro- hibited words.
92. έπιΦυλλίδες]
ἘπιΦυλλίδεςare small stunted grapes, which do not form them- selves into large and prominent clusters, but remain close to the vine-leaves, and are overlooked, or rejected as worthless, at the vintage.
ἐπιφυλλίδες, τὰ ἐπὶτοȋς Φύλλοις, says Suidas.
κέκληται 8E οὕτω, he continues, borrowing from the Scholiast here, fita TO [ἐπὶ] τοȋς Φύλλοιςκαλύπτεσθαι, ἢ τὰ πρὸς αὐτοȋς τοȋς Φύλλοις.
And Gais- ford, in his note on Suidas, cites from an unpublished gloss on Gregor.
Naz. fol. 65, ἐπιΦυλλὶς, ἡἐν τρυγήτῳ ἐν τοȋς Φύλλοις λανθάνουσα.
The phrase χελι- 86vcap μουσεȋα, singing-places for swallows, is another quotation from Euripides.
παρὰ τὰ ἐν ἈλκμήνηΕὐριπίδου, says the Scholiast,94. χορὸν λάβη̩]
Merely to obtain a chorus, to be one of the three tragedians selected to exhibit their plays, free of all expense to themselves, in public at the Athenian Dionysia, was no small triumph for a young dramatist, even if his play did not ultimately win the prize.
See Peace 801 and the note there.
It was a, triumph, we may well believe, which many would obtain only once in their lives.95. προσουρήσοντα] Προσουρέω is used here in exactly the same sense as immeio in Persius, vi. 73.
The Muse is spoken of as a courtezan, granting her favours to the poets who woo her.
See Knights 517 (to which Brunck refers) ;
Wasps 1028.100.
αἰθέρα K.T.X.]
As examples of the hazardous ventures in which his soul delights, he cites, or travesties, three passages of Euripides.
(1) Aether, the bedchamber of Zeus, is referred by the Scholiast to a line in the MelanippeDio.
Those be mere vintage-leavings, jabberers, choirs Of swallow-broods, degraders of their art, Who get one chorus, and are seen no more, The Muses’ love once gained.
But 0, my friend, Search where you will, you'll never find a true Creative genius, uttering startling things.
HER.
Creative ?
how do you mean ?
DIO.
I mean a man Who'll dare some novel venturesome conceit, Air, Zeus's chamber, or Time'sfoot, or this, ''was not my mind that more:
my tongue committed A little perjury on its owu account., HER.
You like that style ?
Dio.
Like it ?
I dote. upon it.(Melanippe Sapiens, Fragm. 9, Waguer), which Aristophanes has already borrowed in the Thesmophoriazusae (272),(2) The foot of Time is ascribed by the Scholiast to the Alexander (Fragm. 23, Wagner), καὶ Χρόνου προὔβαινεποὺς, and it subsequently reappeared in a Chorus of the Bacchae (889).
It may have seemed a daring metaphor at first, but now, Time being personified, it has become a part of our everyday language.
Shakespeare speaks of " the lazy foot of time," " the swift foot of time," ‟the noiseless and inaudible foot of time,” and again of "hasty-footed time." (3) The third is an expansion of the famous line of the Hippolytus, which is more precisely quoted, in part, infra 1471, and is considered in the note there.
ὀμόσαι καθ’ ἱερω̑ν, to be sworn upon the sacrifices, is a very common phrase :
the first complete words in the MS. of Aristotle's Polity of Athens are καθ’ ἱερω̑ν ὀμόσαντες.
The compound ἐπιορκέωιs sometimes employed in an innocent sense, without any idea of perjury, and Brunck thinks it is so employed here ;
but, when so employed, it means not simply "to swear" but "to adjure,” and is followed by the name of the god to whom the appeal is made ;
and, anyhow, Aristophanes, treating the line as an apology for perjury, would hardly have used the word here in any other than its ordinary signification.
ἰδία τη̑ς φρενὸς, on its own account, apart from the mind.103. μἀλλά]
That is, μὴ ἀλλά.
Don't say “do they please me ?”
It is not a105. μὴ τὸν ἐμὸν οἴκει]
This is another quotation from Euripides.
καὶ TOVTO, says the Scholiast, Trapa. τὸ έν Ἀνδρ
ο- μάχη̩:
There is no such line in the Andro- mache;
and, if the Scholiast wrote Ἀνδρομάχη̩, he was probably misled by thinking of lines 581, 2 of that play.
But it is generally supposed that he wrote Ἀνδρομέδα̩, and Wagner gives it as the 31st fragment of the Andromeda, making it the reply of Cepheus to the complaint of Perseus (fragm. 30), who is claiming Andromeda in marriage, but can obtain no satisfactory reply from her father.
The words μὴ τὸν ἐμὸνοἴκει νου̑ν mean "Do not manage, or dispose of, my mind " ;
that is, do not take upon yourself to deliver my sentiments.
But Dionysus, playing on the double meaning of οἴκει (manage or inhabit), points to the house of Heracles, before which they are stand- ing, and adds ἔχεις γὰρ οἰκίαν for you have a dwelling of your own;
as if the preceding words had meant Dwell not in my mind.
He is nettled at the pre- sumption of Heracles, professing to interpret his opinions on dramatic literature.
Dramatic criticism is' not Heracles's strong point;
eating is.
And therefore when Heracles returns to theHER.
I vow its ribald nonsense, and you know it.
Dio. "
Rule not my mind " :
you've got a house to mind.
HER.
Really and truly though 'tis paltry stuff.
Dio.
Teach me to dine !
XAN.
But never a word of me.
Dio.
But tell me truly—’twas for this I came Dressed up to mimic you—what friends received
And entertained you when you went below To bring back Cerberus, in case I need them.
And tell me too the havens, fountains, shops, Roads, resting-places, stews, refreshment rooms, Towns, lodgings, hostesses, with whom were found The fewest bugs.
XAN.
But never a word of me.
HER.
You are really game to go ?
Dio.
0 drop that, can't you ?
And tell me this :
of all the roads you knowattack, Dionysus scornfully replies, δει- πνεȋν με δίδασκε, Give me a lesson on eating, on which you are an authority ;
not on dramatic poetry, of which you know nothing.
112.
λιμένας κ.τ.λ.]
Dionysus makes a traveller's usual inquiries, but they are mostly inapplicable to his journey to Hades, and he does not wait for an answer.
Two of the items enumerated we shall however meet again, the ἀνα- παύλς or resting-places, infra 185, 195, and the πανδοκευρίαςοr hostesses (for the suggestion that the word is here equivalent to πανδοκεȋα is quite ground- less), infra 549-578.
The meaning of 8Lairας and ἐκτροπὰςιs not absolutely certain ;
but it would seem that by the former we are to understand " boarding- houses," and by the latter diverticula or diversoria, places of resort, to reach which, for shelter or other convenience, a traveller would turn aside from his road.
Cf. supra 37 ;
Eur. Rhesus 881.116. καὶ σύ γε]
Even you;
even the pleasure-loving and effeminate Dionysus, a personage standing in such marked contrast to the formidable speaker.
Some recent editors, adopting a con- jecture of Seidler, make these words commence the reply of Dionysus;
and indeed my own translation was framed on that basis.
119.
θερμήν]
We shall see directly that the first road proposed is rejected at?
being too hot (122), and the next as being too cold (125).121.
ἀπὸ κάλω καὶθρανίου]
By rope and stool.
The operator would stand on the stool, adjust the rope round his own neck, then kick away the stool, and so be hanged.
θράνονς καὶ θρανάτιαταπεινά τινα διΦρίδια καὶ ὑποπόδιαλέγονται* ἐΦ’ ὧν ἱατάμενοιοf ἀπαγχόμενοιἀρτω̑σιν ἑαυτοὺς, ἀπολακτίζοντες αὐτά.
—Scholiast.
But in- asmuch as ἀπὸ κάλω πλεȋνιn Thuc. iv. 25 and elsewhere signifies to be towed, and θρανίονιs also used for a rower's bench (whence θρνίτης), Fritzsche sug- gests, perhaps too ingeniously, that there is a play upon the words, and that Dionysus is to be uncertain whether they mean by rope and stool or by towing and rowing, until the addition κρεμάσαντι σαυτὸνdiscloses the sense in which they are really intended to be taken.122. πνιγηράν] Stifling.
πρὸς τὸν πνιγμὸν τη̑ς άγχόνηςκαὶῶσπερ ὀδοῦ καυματώδους.— Scholiast.
As regards the rope and stool, it signifies the suffocation pro- duced by hanging.
As regards the road, it means suffocatingly hot..123.
τετριμμένη]
Ἅμα μὲν ὡς ἐπὶ όδοῦ κατημαξευμέης, ἅμα δὲ καὶ πρὸς τὸκώνειον διὰ θυείαςτρίβεσθαι.—Scholiast.
The hemlock (cicuta virosa) is a plant grow- ing by stagnant, or nearly stagnant, water to the height of several feet.
Its leaves and flowers were chopped up (σύν- τομος) and cast into a mortar (θυεία), where they were pounded (τετριμμένη) until all the poisonous juice was pressed out, ready for use.
The growing plant is itself a virulent poison.
125.
ψυχάν]
All commentators, from Spanheim downwards, illustrate this pas- sage from the description which Plato gives in the Phaedo of his master's death.
The solemn discourse on immortality isWhich is the quickest way to get to Hades ?
I want one not too warm, nor yet too cold.
HER.
Which shall I tell you first ?
which shall it be ?
There's one by rope and bench :
you launch away And-bang yourself.
Dio.
No thank you :
that's too stifling.
HER.
Then there's a track, a short and beaten cut, By pestle and mortar.
Dio.
Hemlock, do you mean ?
HER.
Just so.
Dio.
No, that's too deathly cold a way;
You have hardly started ere your shins get numbed.
HER.
Well, would you like a steep and swift descent ?
Dio.
Aye, that's the style :
my walking powers are small.
HER.
Go down to the Cerameicus.
Dio.
And do what ?
HER.
Climb to the tower's top pinnacle- Dio.
And then ?over, and Socrates is ready to die.
Ac- cordingly he says to Crito ἐνεγκάτω τις τὰ Φάρμακον, εἰ τέτριπται’ εἰ δὲ μὴ, τριψάτω o ἄνθρωπας.
The man presently brings the poison ἐν κύλικι,τετριμμένον, and Socrates drinks it.
In obedience to the man's directions, he walks about for a short time, till, his legs growing heavy, he lies down on his back and covers his face.
The man pinches his foot, and asks if he feels anything.
He replies in the negative.
Then the man tries his κνήμας, with the same result;
καὶ ἐπανιὼν οὕτωςἡμῖν ἐπεδείκνυτο, ἅτι ψύχοιτό τε καὶ πηγνῦτο.
When the deadly cold reaches his heart he gives a slight shudder, and so dies.
Beck refers to Pliny, N. H. xxv. 95, "semini et foliis [cicutae] refrigeratoria vis:
quos necat, incipiunt algere ab extremitatibus cor- poris."129.
καθέρπυσόν νυν ἐς Κεραμεικόν]
Of Cerameicus and its torch-races we shall hear more, infra 1087-1099.
In using the word καθέρπυσον, Get you down to the Cerameicus, Heracles appears to forget for the moment that he ought not to talk as if he were really on the Athenian stage.130.
τὸν πύργον τὸν ὑψηλόν]
This is doubtless, as Fritzsche has already sug- gested, the πύργος Τίμωνος, which Pau- sanias (Attica, xxx. 4) places in the im- mediate neighbourhood of the Academy, whence the runners in the torch-race started.
See the notes infra 1087, 1093.
It was believed to be the place in which the misanthrope shut himself up to avoid all intercourse with his fellow men.
The idea that a fall from a lofty tower is the quickest way to arrive εἰς Ἅιδου κάτω, is reproduced by Apuleius in the tale of Cupid and Psyche, Metamorphoses, bk.vi- Psyche, bidden by Venus to proceed ad inferos for the purpose of bringing back a casket from Proserpine, pergit ad quam-piam turrim praealtam, indidem, se datu ra praecipitem:
sic enim rebatur ad inferos recta et pulcherrime se posse descendere.
However the tower itself, in fairy style, advises her to take two coins in her mouth, and go there in the regular manner through the rift of TaeDarum, and by the ferry-boat of Charon.
HIde squalido seni, says the tower, dab'is, nauli nomine, de stipibus quas feres alteram ;
the other coin (stips) being reserved for the return journey.
And Psyche, follow- ing these instructions, arrives at her journey's end much as Dionysus does in the present play.
The tale has often been told in our language, but nowhere more gracefully than in The Earthly Paradise.
He rightly takes λαμπάδα to mean the torch-race (λαμπάδαἔδραμες, Wasps 1203) and ἀΦιεμένηνstarted (ἄΦες ἀπὸ βαλβίδως, Knights 1159).
But a very inferior Scholiast (Gloss. Victor), supposing ἐν- τεῦθν to belong to ἀΦιεμένην, and not, as it really does, to θεῶ, infers that a torch was dropped from the tower as a signal to start the runners in the torch-race, though indeed, on his construction, the torch-race would not be mentioned at all.
This blunder has misled many, but the Oxford lexicographers, and Mr. Green, Dr. Merry, and Dr. Blaydes, all take the right view.133. εἷναι]
Start them.
This first εἷνοι is the cry of the impatient spectators to the σαλπιγκὴς, whose duty it was to start the runners by a trumpet blast.
That the trumpet was used in historic times for this purpose is admitted even in the Gloss.
Victor, which merely suggests the use of the dropped torch πρὸ τοῦεὺρε- θη̑ναι παρὸ Tvρσηνοῖς τὴν σάλπιγγα.
As the σόλπιγξ was in common use in Homer's time, it was doubtless invented long before the institution of the Athe- nian races.
134.
ἐγκεΦάλου θρίω δύο] Θρῖον, pro- perly a fig-leaf (θρῖον, TO τη̑ς συκη̑ςΦύλ- λον, Pollux, i, segm. 237), gave its name to a dainty much affected by the ancient Greeks;
a sort of rissole composed of suet, milk, honey, eggs, fresh cheese, and wheat flour wrapped up in a fig- leaf and cooked in a rich broth.
Some-HER.
Observe the torch-race started, and when all
The multitude is shouting Let them go, Let yourself go.
Dio.
Go !
whither ?
HER.
To the ground.
Dio.
And lose, forsooth, two envelopes of brain.
I'll not try that.
HER.
Which will you try ?
Dio.
The way You went yourself.
HER.
A parlous voyage that, For first you'll come to an enormous laketimes roasted brains were added, and sometimes the rissole consisted of no- thing but brains, n δὲ σευασία, saysέθηκε τὸ φύλλον.
A somewhat similar, though a very much simpler, dish is still in use in the Levant.
Mr. Curzon, in his " Visits to Monasteries in the Levant," gives the following recipe for “Dolma of Vine-leaves " :
"Put the vine-leaves in boiling water for a moment;
put a small quantity of mincemeat and rice into each, and wrap it up in the leaf;
stew them in broth."
The expression in the text is, of course, due to the fact that brains were a common ingredient of a θρīον ;
but Dionysus is applying the term θρίω to the two lobes of his own brain, o ἐγκέφαλ
ος ἔστι διλόος τὸ δὲ μέσον αὐτου̃ διαιρέει μη̂νιγξ λεπτή.
—Hippo- crates de Morbo Sacro. o ἐγκέφλος διττὸς, μαλακώτερ
ος μὲν ὁ πρόσθιος, σκλη- ρότερ
ος δὲ ὁ λοιπὸς, ὃν ἐγκεφαλίδα (cere- bellum) καλου̂σιν οἱ άνατομικοί—Galen de usu partium corporis humani.
And he adds that the entire brain is surrounded by two membranes.
Modern science recognizes a third lobe, and a third membrane ;
but the difference is rather verbal than real.
137. λίμνην]
This is the Acherusian lake, which was deemed, says Lucian, the first stage in the passage to the realms below ;
a lake which it was im- possible to cross without the aid of the ferryman ;
too deep to ford ;
too wide to swim ;
nay, even the ghosts of dead birds could not fly across it (De Luctu 3).
Compare Aesch. Ag. 1125 ;
Eur. Alcestis 444 ;
Here. Fur. 770.
On the present aspect of the famous Epirote lake and river see Bp. Wordsworth's Greece, p. 254.
The Acheron falls from the mountains of Suli through a deep and rocky gorge, expands into a turbid and eddying stream, and then winds quietly through a flat and marshy plain (in which it forms the Acherusian lake and unites itself with the Cocytus) into the Ionian Sea.139.
τυννουτω̝ί]
Συνάγων τοὺς δακτύλους φησὶν, ἀντὶ του̂ μικρῷ.φοβεî δὲ αἀτο̇ν ἐπί- τηδες σμικρύων TO πλοîον.
—Scholiast.
Cf. Clouds 878.
The smallness of Charon's boat and the consequent danger to the passengers are the theme of Lucian's Tenth Dialogue of the Dead, a prose dialogue which has been so happily transmuted into English verse by the late Mrs. Benjamin Wood that I may perhaps be allowed to quote the opening stanzas.
The interlocutors are Charon and his passengers.
CHA.
You see how 'tis with us:
the skiff is small
And leaky:
a slight matter would capsize us ;
I cannot say 'tis safe to take you all Thus heavy laden.
PASS.
What would you advise us, Charon, that safely we be ferried o'er?
CHA.
Leave your superfluous luggage on the shore, And naked, each of you, my wherry enter:
E'en thus you'll almost fill it to the brim :
Your goods, I fear, might cause some misadventure, Chiefly to such of you as cannot swim.
Stand by the ladder, Hermes, and attend
That all undress, ere they the boat ascend.
So the rich man must lay aside his riches;
and the despot his pride and his kingly crown;
and the philosopher his arrogance and hypocrisy, and even his beard;
and the other passengers the various incumbrances, physical or mental, with which the satirist thinks fit to endow them.140. δύ' ὀβολώ]
All other writers concur in stating the fare to be a single obol ;
but the suggestion that these δύ' ὀβολὼ are either the fare for the two, or the price of a return ticket for Dionysus (see the note on 130 supra), is, even if consistent with the language used here, absolutely untenable in the face of line 270 infra.
Why then did Aristo- phanes, departing from the universal tradition, fix the fare at two obols ?
I think that the reason is plain.
ItOf fathomless depth.
Dio.
And how am I to cross ?
HER.
An ancient mariner will row yon over In a wee boat, so big.
The fare's two obols.
Dio.
Fie!
The power two obols have, the whole world through !
How came they thither!
HER.
Theseus took them down.
And next you'll see great snakes and savage monsters
In tens of thousands.
Dio.
Yon needn't try to scare me, I'm going to go.
HER.
Then weltering seas of filthwas to give Dionysus the opportunity of alluding to the δύ’ ὀβολὼ, which every individual of the many thousands before him had that morning paid for a seat in the Dionysian theatre.
I see no reason for restricting the allusion, as Boeckh seems to do in his admirable discussion of Athenian doles (Public Economy, bk. ii, chaps. 13 and 15), to the διωβελία or dole of two obols, which, under the name of θεωρικὸν, the State supplied for the entrance money of the poorer citizens, and which we now know from Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 28, was first introduced by Cleophon, and therefore not long before the production of this play.
The δύ’ ὀβολὼ "had equal power, whether they came out of the Public Treasury or out of the proper purse of the spectator.
The Scholiast and others dream about the δικαστικὸν, which was three obols, or the ἐκκλη- σιαστικὸν, which was not yet in exist- ence, though, even had these been existing doles of two obols each, they would in the present connexion have been οὐδὲν πρὸς Διόνυσον.142. Θησεὺς ἢγαγεν]
How comes this Attic coinage to be current in the world below ?
As his friend Theseus was the only Athenian who had ever been down there alive, Heracles can only suppose that he took some obols with him, and introduced them there.
145.
βόρβορ
ον πολύν]
This notion, apparently derived from Orphic sources, was widely prevalent in the ancient world.
Spanheim refers to Plato's Phaedo, chap. 13, where Socrates says that oi τάς τελετὰς ἡμîν καταστήσαντες (cf. infra 1032) have taught ὄτι ὂς ἂν ἀμύητ
ος καὶ ἀτέλεστος εἰς "Αιδου ἀΦίκηται, ἐν βορβόρω̝ κείσεται.
This dooms all the uninitiated, whether bad or good, to the same punishment;
but as Diogenes the Cynic said (Diog. Laert.
bk. vi, segm.
39, to which Fritzsche refers), γέλοιον εὶ ’Αγησίλαος μέν καὶ ’Επαμεινώδας ἐν τω̨ βορβόρω̨ διάξοσιν, εὐτελείς δέ τινες μεμνη- μὲηοι ἐν ταîς Μακάρων νήσοις σονται.
Aristophanes, it will be observed, avoids this absurdity by confining this punish- ment to criminals.
And others did the same:
" Esse inferos Zenon Stoicus docuit,'' says Lactantius, Divine Insti- tutes, vii. 7, " et sedes piorum ab impiis esse discretas;
et illos quidem quietas et delectabiles incolere regiones, hos vero luere poenas in tenebrosis locis atque in coeni roraginibus hοrrendis.
”149. μητέῤ ἠλοίησεν]
That is to say, was a μητραλοίας, a mother-beater, not, as often translated, a matricide.
So a son who πατρὸς γνάθον ἐπάταξεν is termed a πατρλοίας, infra 274.
And see the case of the Πατραλοίας in the Birds.
So in the first speech of Lysias against Theo- mnestus, § 8, to be a πατραλοίαν or μη- τραλοίαν is described as the equivalent of τὴν τεκου̂σαν ἦ τὸν φύσαντα τύπτειν.
Here the Scholiast explains ἠλοίησεν by ἒτυψεν.151.
Μορσίμου]
The situation is per- haps becoming too strained, and is therefore relieved by a little comic satire about this contemptible trage- dian, who has already been ridiculed in the Knights and the Peace.
The man who copies out, with intent to perpetuate, a speech from one of his tragedies, is to share, in the world below, the doom of the vilest criminals.
Few, apparently, would have been affected by this sentence, since not one line from any tragedy of Morsimus has, so far as I know, been preserved.
153.
πυρρίχην Κινσίον]
It may be that Dionysus does not altogether ap- prove of this renewed incursion of Heracles into the domain of literary criticism ;
at all events he immediately caps his denunciation by another.
The πυρρίχη was a dance in which youths, clad in complete armour, and moving to the strains of martial music, mimicked the operations of regular warfare, ad- vancing and retreating, stooping down and springing up, and making as though they were discharging or avoiding darts, arrows, or other missiles.
Plato, Laws, vii. 815 a ;
Hesychius s. v. πυρρίχας.
A musical accompaniment to this dance had been composed by Cinesias, theAnd ever-rippling dung:
and plunged therein, Whoso has wronged the stranger here on earth, Or robbed his boylove of the promised pay, Or swinged his mother, or profanely smitten His father's cheek, or sworn an oath forsworn, Or copied out a speech of Morsimus.
Dio.
There too, perdie, should he be plunged, whoe'er Has danced the sword-dance of Cinesias.
HER.
And next the breath of flutes will float around you, And glorious sunshine, such as ours, you'll see, And myrtle groves, and happy bands who clap
Their hands in triumph, men and women too.
Dio.
And who are they ?
HER.
The happy mystic bands,worthless κυκλιοδιδάσκαλος, who is one of the dramatis personae in the Birds.
Κίνησίας, διθυραμβοποιὸς
ός ἐποίησε πυρρί- χην.—Scholiast, Suidas.
ὁ Κινησίας, says Plutarch in his treatise, Whether the Athe- nians were more glorious in arms or in δόξης μετέσχηκε.
He was a favourite subject for Aristophanic satire, and there are two other allusions to him in the present play, 366 and 1437.155.
φω̂ς κάλλιστος]
"The commen- tatorsand translators," says Mr. Mitchell, "usually quote in illustration Pindar, Thren.
Fragm. 1, τοîσι (i. e. τοîς μεμυη- μένοις) λάμπει μὲν μένος ἀελίος τὰν ἐνθάδε νύκτα κάτω, and Virgo Aen. vi. 640, 'Largior hic campos aether et lumine vestit Purpureo.'"
And see 454 infra.
The light in which the souls of the righteous will live is comparable even to the brilliancy of the Athenian atmo- sphere ;
for that is the meaning of ὢσπερ ἐνθάδε.
The Athenians are described by Euripides as ἀεὶ ειὰ λομπρατάτον Βαίνοντες ἁβμω̂ς αἰθέρος, always delicately moving through most radiant air (Medea 829):
see Bp. Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. ix.159.
ςξνὄ ἄγων μυστήρια]
Whether by ἄγων μυστήρια we understand, with the older commentators, carrying the mystic properties (ἄγων being used in the same sense as ἄγειν ten lines below), or, with Fritzsche and subsequent editors, cele- brating the mysteries, makes no difference in the sense, since the only way in which the donkey " celebrated the mysteries ” was by " carrying the mystic properties."
The words ἄνος ἄγων μυστήρια either then were, or subsequently became, a common proverb, used of persons who underwent great toil and straits for the benefit or delectation, not of themselves, but of δεια, Photius s. v.
The proverb is very generally recognized by grammarians and paroemiographers .
The Scholiast here says τοîς μυστηρίοις ἐξ ἄστεως εἰς ’Ελευσîνα διὰ τω̃ν ὄνων φέρουσι τα είς την χρείαν ὄθεν ἡ παροιμία.164, 5. χοîρε ... ὑγίαινε]
Χαîρε was a salutation appropriate to all circum- stances :
ὑγίαινε, as a rule, was confined to leave takings.
Lucian's little apology Pro lapsu inter salutandum relates to a slip of the tongue of which he had him- self been guilty, in giving ἁγίαινε as a morning greeting, and which he treats as a very serious breach of good manners, ἴδιόν τε καὶ ἡρυθρίων, καὶ παντοιος ἦν ὑπ’ ἀπορίας, whilst the bystanders, he adds, must have thought him mad or drunk.
XAN.
And I'm the donkey in the mystery show.
But I'll not stand it, not one instant longer.
HER.
Who'll tell you everything you want to know.
You'll find them dwelling close beside the road \ou are going to travel, just at Pluto's gate.
And fare thee well, my brother.
DID.
And to you Good cheer.
(To Xan.)
Now sirrah, pick you up the traps.
XAX.
Before I've put them down ?
DID.
And quickly too.
XAN.
No, prithee, no :
but hire a body, one
They’re carrying out, on purpose for the trip.
Dio.
If I can't find one ?
XAN.
Then I'll take them.
DID.
Good.
And see !
they are carrying out a body now.
Hallo !
you there, you deadman, are you willing
To carry down our little traps to Hades ?
CORPSE.
What are they?
Dio.
These.
CORP.
Two drachmas for the job?
And Hephaestion, he says a little further on, nearly died of shame, when he in- advertently gave the like morning greet- ing to Alexander the Great.
Mr. Mitchell thinks that there is a little latent irony in the use of the two salutations here :
Heracles wishing Dionysus joy in face of the perils he is about to encounter ;
and Dionysus wishing his gigantic brother more health and strength of mind as well as of body.
Heracles now re-enters his house, and Dionysus pre- pares to continue his journey.168.
ἐπὶ του̂το]
For the purpose.
For what purpose is not quite clear, but probably the Scholiast's explanation is right, ἐπὶ TO ἀπελθείν εἰς TOP Ἃιδην.
With τότ’ἒμ ἂγειν in the following line we must understand λέγω or some such word.170.
ἐκφἐρουσι]
At this moment a corpse, wrapped in its grave-clothes, and lying on a bier, is being carried across the stage.
Dionysus approaches the bier and holds a short colloquy with its occupant.
He wants the corpse to carry down to Hades their few bits of luggage, using the diminutive, σκευάρια, with the view, as Mr. Mitchell observes, of cheapening the service and driving a better bargain.
The corpse demands two drachmas (12 obols) for the job:
Dionysus offers a drachma and a half;
but the corpse will have no chaffering, and goes on its way unheeding.
The colloquy is not of much importance, but those who witnessed the performance of this play at Oxford (February, 1892) will remember how extremely effective it was upon the stage.174.
ὑπάγεθ' ὑμι̑ς τη̑ς ὁδου̑]
Are these words addressed to the bearers, bidding them proceed on their journey, or to Dionysus and Xanthias, bidding them stand out of the way ?
The Scholiast gives both interpretations, first explain- ing ὑπάγετε by ἀναχωρει̑τε, and subse- quently saying TO δὲ ὑπάγετε ὑμει̑ς τη̑ς ὁδου̑ ὁ νεκρός φηϭι πρὸς τοὺς νεκροφόρους.
Opinions have differed widely on this point, but on the whole it seems to me more probable that ὑπάγειν, with the genitive τη̑ς ὁδου̑, means to withdraw, retire, from the way, like ὑποχωρει̑ν and other compounds of ὑπό ;
and that the command therefore is directed to the travellers, and not to the bearers of the bier.177. ἀναβιῴην]
As a living man would clinch an asseveration by such words as μηκέτι ζῴην, μή νυν ζῴην (Knights 833, Clouds 1255, Lysistrata 531), "May I DIE if I do ! " so, conversely, the dead man emphasizes his strong determination by the ejaculation, "May I LIVE AGAIN if I do !"
The corpse is now carried on the stage, and as it is presumably bound for Charon's ferry some have distributed the triple greeting to Charon, seven lines below, between three speakers, giving the first χαι̑ρ' Χάρων to Dionysus, the second to Xanthias, and the third to the corpse.
But this is not the way of the ancient comedy.
The corpse comes in for a purpose, and when that purpose is fulfilled, goes out again, and nobody is concerned with it further.
And indeed the actor who represented the corpse here, is representing Charon there.179.

They cannot yet see the ferry-boat, but they know, for Heracles has told them, that the ferry is close at hand.
And now Charon is heard behind the scenes, singing out, ὠὸπ, παραβαλου̑, Yoho !
Push her to !
that is to say, Lay her alongside the landing- place, for the passengers to embark (or disembark, 269 infra).
And in another moment the scene is changed ;
a land- scape, representing the Acherusian Lake, being unrolled from the revolving pillar, περίακτος, on one side of the stage till it reaches the revolving pillar on the other, so as to cover the entire back- ground :
whilst Charon with his ferry- boat is visible in front.
It is this sudden change which makes Dionysus exclaim τουτὶ τί ἔϭτι;
Charon is, of course, alone.
In calling out παραβαλου̑ he is merely employing the ordinary language of a ferryman, such as the Athenians were hearing in their har- bours the whole day long.184.
χαι̑ρ' ὦ Χάρων K.T.X.]
This line, as we learn from the Scholiast, is taken bodily from the Aethon, a satyric play of the tragedian Achaeus, who was, indeed, famous for his satyric dramas (Diog. Laert. bk. ii, segm.
133, Vita Menedemi).
He put these words into the mouths of his riotous Satyrs as they came tumbling into the ferry-boat, much to Charon's indignation.
The Satyrs were, of course, playing with the simi- larity of sound between χαι̑ρε and Χάρων.185.
τίς K.T.X.]
Charon makes no re- sponse, at least in words, but goes on with the ordinary business of a ferry- man, calling out the various destina- tions for which he is ready to receive passengers.
He, himself, will take them across the lake :
after which they must reach their destinations as best they can.
He will take passengers bound for (1) the Resting-place from cares andtroubles;
cf. Acharnians 757 ;
(2) the plain through which Lethe, the water of Oblivion, flows;
(3) the Donkey- shearings, the equivalent of Nothing- ness ;
(4) the Cerberians, a name which, the Scholiast remarks, is formed from Cerberus in imitation of the "Cimme- rians," who, according to Homer (Od. xi. 14), dwelt near one entrance to Hades.
Another entrance was at (5) Taenarum, χθόνιον Αιδα ϭτόμα, Pindar, Pyth. iv. 44, whilst (6) ἐς κόρακας is to be taken in the sense in which it is used infra 607, and constantly in Aristophanes, of ab- solute ruin.189.
ϭου̑ γ'εïνεκα]
This may be in- tended, as the Scholiast supposes, to imitate a ferryman's politeness, Certa sir, to oblige you, παρόϭον οὕτως οἱ ναυ̑ται εἰὡθαϭι λέγειν, χαριζόμενοι τῳ̑ ἐπιβάτη̣.
But it is also a jest at the expense of Dionysus, implying that his manifest destiny is to feed the κόρακας.191.
τὴν περὶ τω̑νκρεω̑ν] Κρεω̑ν, τουτέϭτι ϭ ωμάτων, say the Scholiasts, and though they.
give other interpretations, this is no doubt the true one.
Aristophanes is transferring the language of the law- courts to the circumstances of the naval engagement.
A litigant, contending for the rights of a freeborn citizen, was said περὶ του̑ ϭώματος ἀγωνίϭασθαι (Lysias against Pancleon 16) ;
and Aristophanes, speaking of slaves, calls the battle of Arginusae τὴν (μάχην or ναυμαχίαν) περὶ τω̑ν ϭωμάτων, because the slaves, who took part in the struggle, were in like manner contending for the rights of free born citizens.
This passage, and the former explanations of it, are more fully discussed in the Introduction.192.

Trapa τὸν Αὑαίναυ λίθαν]
By the stone of Withering, a fit name for the first resting-place (ἀναπαύλαις, see supra 113), in the kingdom of the Dead.
Fritzsche refers to Eustathius (on Iliad ἐκθανει̑ν λέγει.
The Scholiast here says, φαϭὶ δὲ A ὑαίνου λιθαν τινὰ λέγεϭθαι 'Αθήνηϭι, a statement which Fritzsche accepts, comparing, amongst other ex- amples, the Σειληναυ̑ λίθος at Athens, Pausanias, Attica, xxiii.
6. But it seems far more probable that the stone of Havaenus " is a mere comic coinage in imitation of the "stone of Silenus " and the like.
Another suggestion of the Scholiast, viz. that αὑαίνου is to be con- sidered both as the' genitive case of Havaenus and also as the imperative of αὑαίναμαι, meaning παρὰ τὸν λίθον αὑαίναυ καὶ ξηραίνου, though adopted by Bergler, Brunck and Mitchell, is rightly rejected by Fritzsche and later editors.196. τῳ̑ ξυνέτυχαν] 'Αντὶ Tou, τίνι αἰωνῳ̑ ϭυνέτυχαν ἐκ τη̑ς αἰκίας ἰών ;

Many things there were, which, crossing the path of a traveller, were considered ἐνόδια ϭύμβαλα, portending ill-luck to his journey.

Lucian's Pseudologista17;
and the opening stanzas of Horace, Odes, iii. 27.197.
κάθιζ' ἐπὶ κώπην]
Charon means "
Sit to your oar."
Dionysus takes him to mean "Sit on your oar," and promptly does so.
The Greek words admit of either interpretation.204.
ἀϭαλαμίνιος]
For the people of Salamis were constantly ferrying over from their island to the Athenian har- bours.
Cf. Lys. 59, 60 ;
Eccl. 39.
There is no room for the allusion, which the Scholiast suggests, to the Salaminian trireme or to the battle of Salamis.205.
ἀκούϭει]
You will hear the Frogs, he says, but he nowhere says, You will see them.
And it seems quite certain that the Frogs were not visible to the audience, and that the Frog-songs were sung by musicians behind the scenes, no doubt by the singers who subse- quently become the mystic Chorus of the play.
οὐχ óρω̑νται ἐν τῳ̑ θεάτρῳ οἱ βάτραχοι, οὐδὲ ὁ χορὰς, ἀλλ' ἔϭωθεν μιμ
ου̑ν- ται τοὺς βατράχους.—Scholiast.
And even as regards the actors, it seems probable that as they approach the invisible world, they are partially shrouded from the audience by some veil or other obscuring medium.206.
ἐμβάη̜ς]
So soon as you dip your oars in.
Mr. Mitchell and others, refer- ring to Od. x. 129, would render it "So soon as you grasp, put hand to, the oar.'
But the Frogs would know nothing of the matter until the oar-blade struck the water.
And the real meaning is made very clear by Knights 601, 2, τὰς κώπας λαβόνες ... ἐμβαλόντες.
First they grasp the oars, then they ἐμβάλ- λαυϭι, dip them in the water.207.
βατράχων κύκνων]
Swan-frogs.
One or other of the substantives does duty for an adjective.
Mr. Mitchell com- pares such collocations as ἀνὴρ ναύτης, supra 139;
ἀνὴρ παιητὴς, infra 1008.
But the cases are not quite parallel, and Bothe's suggestion βατραχοκύκνων may very possibly be right.209. βρεκεκεκὲξ κοὰξ κοάξ]

Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax, Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax!
the entirety of this great play.
We shall hear the ghosts of the dead frogs singing in the Acherusian Lake the tunes which, when alive, they had sung in the Marshland of Athens.
And although nothing can be more unlike the croaking of our English frogs than their refrain βρεκεκεκὲξ, κοὰξ, κοὰξ, yet all observers agree that it is an exact imitation of the voices of their brethren in Greece and the countries of the Levant. "
The common frogs of Greece have a note totally different from that of the frogs of the northern climates, and there cannot be a more perfect imitation of it than the 'Brekekekex, koax, koax' of Aristophanes.
"
-Dod- well, ii. 45. Speaking of his visit to Thasos, Mr. Tozer observes, "In the stagnant water the frogs were singing ' Brekekekex, koax, koax ' as clearly as in the days of Aristophanes, the two notes being quite distinct from one another.
"-Islands of the Aegean, p. 309.
Mr. Macgregor, in "The Rob Roy on the Jordan," chap.
ix, remarks that " the croak of a frog has been one of the best means of informing the modern world of the manner in which the ancient Greeks pronounced their beautiful lan- guage....
The frogs of the nineteenth century have probably been faithful to the pronunciation of their race in former times;
and, as we listen in the still night to their curious music, it is exactly as if one set of them, perhaps the tenors, the gentlemen of the choir, kept sing- ing ' Brekekekex,' whilst the softer woo- ing of the ladies is uttered always as ' Koax, koax, koax.'
The din made by millions of these songsters, in a marsh many miles extended, is astounding....
Sometimes they all stop as if by com- mand, and after a few moments of silence the catch-note of some flippant flirt just whispers once, and immediately the whole Babel resumes its universal roar."
Their songs in Aristophanes have something of the grace and airiness, the detachment from human interest, which are so conspicuous in the choruses of the Birds.
But we cannot wonder thatDionysus, having to row in time with their notes, is well-nigh done to death by the rapidity and persistence of their utterances.
215.
Νυσήιον]
"It is impossible," as Dr. Merry observes, " to localize Nysa, for wherever the worship of Dionysus was in vogue, a Mount Nysa was sure to be found, whether in Greece, Asia Minor, Aethiopia, or India."
The name Νύϭα really arose from the latter half of the name Διόνυϭος, and in the words Νυϭήιον Διὸς Διόνυϭ
ον we have, in im- mediate juxtaposition, the name of the God and the fancied derivation of each part of that name.
Neither here, nor in the reiterated invocations of Iacchus with which the Mystics enter, nor in the quotation from Euripides, infra 1211, does the stage Dionysus recog- nize any allusion to himself.
216. ἐν Λίμναις]
The district called Λίμναι, Marsh-land, was adjacent to the Acropolis (Thuc. ii. 15), and close to. the Theatre (Pausanias, Attics, xx. 2).
It contained τὸ ἀρχαιάαταν ἱερὸν ταυ̑ Διονύϭου in Athens (Or. in Neaeram. 76),. where, Thucydides tells us, τὰ ἀρχαιότερα Διονύϭια τη̜̑ δωδεκάτη̜ ποιει̑ται ἐν μηνὶ 'Ar- θεϭτηιω̑νι.
This was the festival of the Χόες, which antiquarians traced back to the arrival at Athens of Orestes to stand his trial for matricide.
The King of Athens, whom some call Demophoon and others Pandion, wishing to show the visitor due respect, but unwilling that, while yet unacquitted, he should enter the Athenian Temples, or share the wine-cup with Athenian citizens, ordered a separate χόα οἴνου έκάϭτῳ παρα-We children of the fountain and the lake Let us wake Our full choir-shout, as.
the flutes are ringing out, Our symphony of clear-voiced song.
The song we used to love in the Marshland up above, In praise of Dionysus to.
produce, Of Nysaean Dionysus, son of Zeus, When the revel-tipsy throng, all crapulous and gay, To our precinct reeled along on the holy Pitcher day.
Brekekekex, k6-ax, ko-ax.
Dio.
O, dear !
O, dear!
now I declare I've got a bump upon my rump,Dio.
But you, perchance, don't care.
49. See Iph. in Taur. 949-60 ;
Suidas, s.v. Χόες.
This was the origin of the drinking-competition, of which we hear so much in the later scenes of the Acharnians, and the procession -with the wine-pitchers and the garlands is the revel of which the Frogs are here singing.
It would seem from Athenaeus that it took place on the Χόες or Pitcher- Day, whereas the Frogs talk of its occurring on the Χύτροι or Pot-Day.
But in truth these Anthesterian Dio- nysia seem to have been originally a one-day festival only (Thuc. ubi supra), called from its principal event, the Χόες ;
the Πιθοιγία, the Χόες, and the Χύτροι, being merely three functions taking place on the same day, ὲν μια̑ ὴμέρᾳ ἄγονται οἱ Χύτροι καὶ οἱ Xóες.- Suidas, s.v. Χύτροις;
Schol.at Ach. 1076.
Afterwards they were expanded into three days;
the Πιθοιγία or Broaching of the casks being celebrated on the eleventh of Anthesterion (Plutarch, Conviv. Problems, iii. 7);
the Χόες on the twelfth (Harpocration and Suidas, s.v.);
and the Χύτροι on the thirteenth (Philochorus, cited by Harpocration and Suidas, s. v.).
When the festival, was instituted the Λίμναι were doubtless real marshes, a fit recreation-ground for the φιλῳδὸν γένος.219. κατ' ἐμὸν τέμενος]
The Frogs rather pertly claim as their own precinct what was really the precinct of Dionysus.228.
ὦ πολλὰ πράττων]
Dionysus, with the πολυπραγμοσύνη of an Athenian (and in Aristophanes almost everybody has the characteristics of an Athenian) must needs be criticizing what he does not understand.
It is quite natural that the Frogs should keep up a constant chorus of music, for, on the strength of the reeds amongst which they dwell, they claim the special favour and friend- ship of the gods who require the reed for their musical instruments, the Muses and Apollo and Pan.
Pan's syrinx was merely a row of reeds, fastened together with thread and beeswax;
σύριγξ έστὶ συνθήκη καλάμων λίνω̜καὶ κηρω̩̑συνδε- θει̑σα.—Pollux, iv. 69. "Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures In- stituit."—Virg. Eel. ii. 33. ό κηροδέτας κάλσμοςοὐρείου Πανός.—Iph. in Taur. 1126. Of. Plato's 14th Epigram in the Anthology.
Nor was the reed less use- ful in the lyre, the favourite instrument of Apollo and the Muses.
For though Aristophanes avails himself of the variety of names to call the Muses εὔλυροι and Apollo όφορμικτὰς, yet undoubtedly the lyre and the φόρμιγξ, and for the matter of that the κιθαρις also, were originally the same instrument (Gevaert, La Mu- sique do l'Antiquité, ii. 249), and the reed was used for what the French call the chevalet, and we the bridge, the part which keeps the strings from coming into contact, with the body of the instrument.
See the note on ὑπολύριον, infra 233.
The invention of the lyre is described in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes 41-51.
Hermes chanced to find a tortoise-shell, and having scooped out its occupant, he cut some reeds, δόνα- Kar καλάμοιο, by measure, μέτροισι, and drilled them through the shell.
Then he wrapped the shell in a piece of bull's hide and inserted two side-pieces, πήχεις, with a cross-piece, ζυγὸν, at the top from one side-piece to the other.
Finally he stretched seven strings of sheep-gut from the ζυγὸν to the shell.
In this case it would seem that seven piecesDio.
Hang you, and your ko-axing too !
There's nothing but ko-ax with you.
FR.
That is right, Mr. Busybody, right!
For the Muses of the lyre love us well;
And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays ;
And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight;
For the strong reed's sake which I grow within my lake
To be girdled in his lyre's deep shell.
Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
Dio.
My hands are blistered very sore ;
My stern below is sweltering so,of reed must have been driven through the shell, each supporting a string.
The ἓνεκα δόνακος below, though in terms applicable only to Apollo and the Muses, refers, in truth, to all the divinities mentioned.
From the manifold use of the reed in musical instruments, it is called by Apuleius, in the tale of Cupid and Psyche, Musicae suavis nutricula.
230. κεροβάτας]
Three interpretations of this word are mentioned by the Scholiast, (1) horned, (2) horn-footed, (3) haunting the mountain peaks.
All three characteristics are recognized at the very outset of the Homeric Hymn (xviii) to Pan, whom the poet describes as αἰγιπόδην, δικέpara,And see the passage from Euripides quoted in the preceding note.
Here κεροβάτας doubtless means horn-footed, since horns on the head can hardly be worked into a compound with βαίνω;
and the Frogs would know nothing of Pan on the mountain peaks.
With καλαμόφθαγγα we must understand παίγ- ματα, or some such word.241.
μα̑λλαν μὲν αὖν]
Far from acceding to the weary oarsman's request for peace, the Frogs announce their intention of singing their very best and loudest.
κύπειρ
ος is the Latin cyperos, the English galingale, a plant common in lakes and marshes.
The root is aromatic, and was formerly much used for medicinal pur- poses.
φλέως seems to be our water-flag.251.
τουτί]
The βρεκεκεκὲξ καὰξ κοὰξ.
This, says Dionysus, I take or borrow from you ;
τὰ λέγειν βρεκεκεκὲξ παρ' ὑμω̑ν ἔμαθον.—Scholiast.
In the preceding line, he has for the first time chimed in, and shouted the refrain in competition with the Frogs.

DIO.

εἰ διαρραγήσομαι]
Dionysus must either row slower or burst.
The time, which their song gives, requires a quicker stroke than he can keep up.
Therefore he must stop their song, and this he hopes to do by out-shouting them in their own refrain.262.
τούτω̜] Τω̜̃λέγειν βρεκεκεκέξ.—
Scholiast.
The contest between them is which can most effectively sing the words βρεκεκεκὲξ κοὰξ κούξ.
In lines 250, 256, and 261, Dionysus and the Frogs exercise their musical powers simultaneously, but in 267 Dionysus has it all his own way.
The contest is a purely vocal one, and the notionthat Dionysus is striking at the Frogs with his oar, a notion first broached by Frere and Mitchell in their translations (Mr. Mitchell translates this episode in an Appendix to his edition), and after- wards gravely advocated by Fritzsche, is contrary to the whole spirit of the scene.

Is that you, Xanthias ?
They have now crossed the water, and are in Hades itself, and it is so dark that Dionysus cannot be sure who the approaching figure is.276.
νυνί y'ὁρω̑]
He looks at the audience, who always relished a joke at their own expense.281. μάχιμον]
The abject little coward wishes it to be understood that Heracles was alarmed lest Dionysus, if he went below, should perform such prodigies of valour as would throw the labours of Heracles into the shade, and therefore tried to choke him off the expedition by exaggerating the difficulties in the way.
But as Bergler says, "res ipsa mox indi- cabit quam sit μάχιμος."
The following line, the Scholiast tells us, is borrowed from the Philoctetes of Euripides,Musgrave, and subsequent collectors of Euripidean fragments, combine this line with others found in Aristotle, Stobaeus, etc., and make the whole passage part of the prologue, supposed to be spoken by Odysseus.285.
νὴ τὸν Ata]
Xanthias assents to the eulogy which his master passes on his own prowess, but of course only ironically;
and immediately proceeds to put it to the test.
It is difficult to say whether, in the scene which follows, we are to understand Xanthias as really seeing what he describes, or merely pretending to do so, for the purpose of frightening his master.

In these dramatic contests, which were part of the religious festival of the Dionysia, the priest of Dionysus was, so to say, the Chairman who presided over the proceedings.
He sat in a con- spicuous seat or throne in the centre of the front row (the semicircle which half surrounded the orchestra), with thirty-three honoured guests on each side.
The very throne on which, in later days, he sat has been unearthed during the excavations recently made in the Athenian Theatre, and still bears the legible inscription, 'Ιερεὺς Διονύσου 'Ελευθερέως.
The Temple of Διόνυσ
ος 'Ελευθερεὐς (which must be distinguished from the ἀρχαιότατον ἱερὸν mentioned in note on 216 supra), was situated within the circumference of the Theatre (Pau- sanias, Attica xx. 2), and derived its name from the fact that the wooden statue it contained had been brought from the border town of Eleutherae under Mount Cithaeron (Id. xxxviii. 8).
Its foundations are believed to have been recently discovered, apparently at the back of the stage.
See Mr. Haigh's Attic Theatre, iii. 4 and vii.
3. In the latter chapter is given an admirable illustration of.
the priest's marble throne.
It is to this exalted personage that Dionysus appeals from the stage, trust- ing that he will not permit the God, whom he serves, to perish in this ignominious manner.
The Chorus have not yet entered the orchestra, so that nothing intervenes between the actor and the priest.
If Dionysus survives, he will come and join his priest in the potations to which they are both ad-dieted, and at which the priest could have no more welcome guest than the God of Wine.304.
γαλη̃ν άρω̃]
In the still-extant Orestes of Euripides, the hero recovering from a paroxysm of frenzy, says έκκυμά- των γἀρ αὖθις αὖγαλήν' opS (279), After the storm I see afresh fine weather.
Hege- lochus, who acted the part, when reciting the line made a slight involuntary pause ίψαντοςτου̃ πνεύματος, spiritu de- ficiente), after γαλήν', so rounding it off into a complete word, as if the poet had written γαλη̃ν άρω̃, I see a cat.
A similar pause after the first syllable of a-fresh in the English line would change it into After the storm I see a fresh fine wether.
That the mishap of Hegelochus became a favourite jest amongst the Athenian wits, we learn from the Scholiasts here and on the Orestes.
Thus, in an unnamed Comedy of Strattis, one of the speakers seems to have declaimed the line after the fashion of Hegelochus, whereupon the other calls out excitedly ποί ποȋ γαλη̑ν ;
ὦ πρὸς θεω̑ν, ποȋ not λαλη̑ν;
on which the first explains that the word he used was γαληνὰ, and the second replies γαλήν';
έγὼ δ' ῷμην σε λέγειν, γαλη̑ν ἁρω̑, for so I think we should read the passage.
Thus again, Sannyrion, in his Danae, representing Zeus as anxious to get into the tower through a little chink, makes him say, " Into what shall I change myself, to creep through the chink unobserved ?
Shall I change myself into a. γαλη̑ ?
But then Hege- lochus would betray me, calling out with all his might έκ κυμάτων yap αὒθις αὖγαλη̑ν ἁρω̑.

Who is the god to blame for my destruction ?is usually translated, and the interpreta- tion seems to be as old as Heliodorus (Aethiopics, iii. 5), But he (the priest), out of fear, blushed for me ;
on which I take the liberty of remarking (1) that όδἱ would naturally refer to the speaker's companion on the stage rather than to one of the spectators;
see Wasps 78 and the note there ;
(2) that a blush is ἐρυθρὸν, a totally different colour to πυρρὸν ;
(3) that it is mere nonsense to say that a man, out of fear, blushed for another (see Lucian's Anacharsis 33) ;
and (4) that if we look to the manner in which Aristophanes elsewhere con- nects the colour πυρρὰν with the effect of δέος, we cannot doubt that the real meaning is At ille (Dionysus) prae timore in me cacavit.
Of. Eccl. 1061 πυρρὸν ἂψει μ'αύτίκα γπὸ TOO δέους. Id. 329, 330;
Knights 900, where again some absurdly translate πυρρὸς, blushing.
It is, in my opinion, to the state of his garments, which Xanthias has only just discovered, that the ejaculation οἲμοε τάλας, at the commencement of the speech, is intended to apply.
I see that Van Leeuwen, in his edition pub- lished many years after this note was written, takes the true view of the word ύπερεπυρρίασε, and quotes Bakhuyzen as doing the same :
but as they both leave 307 to Dionysus, read σου at the end of 308 and explain άδὶ, Bakhuyzen by ό πρωκτὸς, and Van Leeuwen by ό κροκωτὸς, they can hardly be said to have done much to elucidate the passage.310.
τίν' αίτιάαομαι κ.τ.λ.]
He asks about himself what, in Medea 1208, Creon asks about his hapless daughter, τίς σ' ὦδ' ὰτίμως δαιμόνων άπώλεσεν ;
and his mind being full of Euripidean phraseology, and remembering that Αὶθὴρ was one of the poet's new-fangled deities (infra 892), he asks whether Aether is the God to be blamed for hismisfortunes, and, naming Aidepa, goes on, irrelevantly, through the rest of line 100 supra.
This I think is what the passage means, and not, as the Scholiasts suggest, that Dionysus is speaking of Euripides himself as being, indirectly, the author of his troubles.
The words which follow in the text, αὐλεῖ τις ἔνδΟθεν, are a stage direction, παρεπιγραφὴ as the Scholiast observes, σημαίνει yap ὅτι ἔσωθέν τις ηὔλησε μὴ όρώμενος τοῖς θεαταῖς.316.
῎Ιακχ᾽ , & ῎Ιακχε]
We have already heard the Chorus, chanting the songs of the Frogs, but we did not see them.
Nor indeed are they yet visible, but they are approaching in their proper character, as the Mystic Chorus of the play.
The wayfarers hear a shout, and recognize τὸν μυστικὸν ῎Ιακχον ;
just as Demaratus of Sparta and Dicaeus the Athenian heard and recognized it during the Persian invasion, and knew that the invisible powers of Eleusis were moving forth to do battle at Salamis against the enemies of Hellas, Hdt. viii.
65. Though Iacchus, the associate of Demeter and Persephone, was originally quite distinct from the Theban Dionysus, yet their attributes were in some respects so similar, that the process of identifica- tion had commenced long before the exhibition of the Frogs.

Ode (1083-1120) in the Antigone of Sophocles, which preceded the present play by more than thirty years.
But in this play there is no identification :
and probably it would have seemed irreverent even to suggest that the Dionysus, here put upon the stage, bore any resemblance to the sacred and mystical Iacchus.320.
Διαγόρας]
Μελῶν ποιητὴς ἄθεος, says the Scholiast, identifying the lyric poet, of whose poems only four lines remain (Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci), with the notorious Diagoras of Melos ;
but this identification is not universally accepted.
The lyric poet seems to have composed a processional melody for the use of the initiated.
Apollodorus, the Scholiast tells us, preferred to read δι᾽ ἀγορᾶς, which was also the original reading of the Venetian MS., though afterwards cor- rected.
This would make the line mean τόν ῎Ιακχον, ὃν ᾄδουσιν ἐξ ἄστεως ὰιδ τῆς ἀγαρᾶς ἐξιόντες εἰς ᾽Ελευσῖνα.—Scholiast.
But even if the procession passed through the agora, which seems more than doubt- ful, and had a special hymn for that section of their journey, which is not very probable, it is clear that it is not passing through the agora now.
The initiated are now gathering and singing before the Temple of Demeter, calling upon Iacchus to come forth and lead them out, and until he appears the procession will not start.
See the next note.
323.
῎Ιακχ᾽, ὦ παλυτίμοις κ.τ.λ.]
The Chorus now make their appearance,clothed in their robes of initiation, and carrying lighted torches, real or pre- tended, in their hands.
The strophe which forms their Parodos or entrance song is a little Ionic a minore system, not καθαρὸν, in the language of metrical writers, but ἐπίμικτον, admitting amongst the regular Ionics ( )an occa- sional bacchic ( ), caric ( ), anapaest and cretic.
The second line, ῎Ιακχ᾽, ὦ ῎Ιακχε, may be regarded as an ejaculation extra metrum.
For the next 137 lines the Chorus are represented as rehearsing in the world below the early stages, as much, no doubt, as the general populace of Athens would see, of that great annual procession from the Cera- meicus to Eleusis (ἀπὸ τοῦ Κεραμεικοῦ εἰς ᾽Ελευσῖνα, Scholiast on 395 and 399), in which they themselves, when alive, had been accustomed to participate.
It took place in September, εἰκάδι Βοηδρομιῶνος τὸν῎Ιακχον ἐξ ἄστε
ος᾽Ελευσῖνάδε πέμπουσιν. —Plutarch, Phocion 28.
The Chorus must be supposed to have mustered in the great building provided for the marshalling of these and similar pro- cessions, and they are now calling Iacchus to come from the adjoining Temple of the Eleusinian deities, and be their divine companion on the long twelve miles journey.
That building and that temple were just within the Peiraeic gate, and in, or close to the boundary of, the Inner Cerameicus.
Εἰ- Πραξιέλους.—Pausanias, Attica, ii.
4. It was this torch-bearing Iacchus whom they escorted from the splendid temple where he dwelt at Athens (πολυτίμοις ἐν ἕδραις ἐνθάδε ναίων) along the Sacred Way to the sanctuary at Eleusis.
The statue was garlanded with wreaths of myrtle, as indeed were Demeter and the officials of the Mysteries (Schol. on Oed. Col. 715) ;
and as-was the whole proces- sion of the Initiated, μυρσίνῳ στεφάνῳ ἐστεφανοῦντο αἱ με μυημένοι, Schol. oil 330.
The statue is brought out (see note on 340), all evil-doers are warned off, andCome to tread this verdant level, Come to dance in mystic revel, Come whilst round thy forehead hurtles Many a wreath of fruitful myrtles, Come with wild and saucy paces Mingling in our joyous dance, Pure and holy, which embraces all the charms of all the Graces, When the mystic choirs advance.
then the procession commences, the Chorus singing hymns to each of the Eleusinian deities in turn, Persephone, Demeter, lacchus, as they pass through the Cerameicus, and out by the Eleu- sinian gate to the bridge over the Cephisus, where a little chaffing (γεφυ- ρισμὸς) takes place, and whence they disappear from our sight on their way to the flower-enamelled Thriasian plain.
It must, of course, be remembered that all these phases of the procession are shown only by the dances and gestures of the Chorus in the orchestra.326.
τόνδ᾽ am λειμῶνα χορεύσων]
The λειμὼν, mentioned here and 344 infra, is the open sward in front of the Athenian Temple, and must not be confounded with the λειμῶνας mentioned below, 374 and 449, which denote the Thriasian plain.
Doubtless the procession com- menced with a dance ;
and indeed dances were, throughout the journey, a promi- nent feature of the religious proceed- ings.
It will be remembered that, since the fortification of Deceleia by the Lacedaemonians, the procession had been compelled to travel by sea, ex- cepting indeed on that one memorable occasion when Alcibiades, restored to Athens and appointed Dictator, άπάντων ἡγεμὼν αὐτοκράτωρ, led out his army to protect the overland route (Xen. Hell. I. iv. 20, 21), so guarding the Mysteries which himself was accused of profan- ing, and neutralizing the garrison at Deceleia which he had himself recom- mended to Sparta.
And whilst the procession had to travel by sea, says Plutarch, it was shorn of its accustomed solemnities, καὶ θυσίσι Kat χορεῖαι Kat πολλὰ τῶν δρωμένων καθ᾽ ὁδὸν ἱερῶν ὅταν εξε- λαύνωσι τὸν ῎Ιακχον ὑπ᾽ ἀνάγκης ἐξελείπετο. —Alcibiades 34.
It will be observed what a prominent part the χορεῖαι held, in Plutarch's estimation, in the journey along the Sacred Way.329.
βρύοντα μύρτων]
Abounding with berries.
πολύκαρπον has much the same meaning, but refers rather to the sort of myrtle employed, as in the expres- sion μυρρίνας τῶν καρπίμων, Peace 1154 ;
whilst the present words signify that the actual wreath would be full of berries.
338.
χοιρείων κρεῶν]
The solemn strain dies away, and the vulgar voice of Xan- thias is heard exclaiming, What a jolly smell of pork!
in allusion to the sacrifice of pigs, which was an important part of the ceremony of initiation.
See Achar- nians 764 ;

The sacred hymn com- mences again, but in a. different strain.
In the Strophe they were invoking lacchus to come out of his temple and appear to his worshippers.
The Anti- strophe is the Song of Joy and Welcome with which they greet his appearance.
The short pause which enabled the actors to hold their little dialogue has, in imagination, been utilized by bringing out the statue of the god.
And now all is song, and dance, and ecstacy.
The torch in his hand is magnified into φλογέας λαμπάδας.
The night is turned into day by the brightness of their Morning Star.
Even age forgets its infirmities and joins, almost involun- tarily, in the dance ;
and all are longing for the procession to start.
Arise, 0 Iacchus.!
waving in thine hands theflaming torches, thou Morning Star of our nightly mystic rites.
The meadow is ablaze with fire.
(All the mystics are waving their lighted torches.)
Now the knee of old men is leaping for joy;
under the influ- ence of the sacred rite they shake off the chronic infirmities of age;
they shake off their long and weary years (cf. Eur, Bacchae 184-190).
But do thou, 0 blessed one, shedding light with thy torch, lead on with forward step the chorus-forming youth to the flowery marshy plain (whichXAN.

takes them to Eleusis).
Throughout lacchus is addressed as a living present person, waving an actual torch, and not as a mere sculptured statue.
At the commencement of the Antistrophe there was apparently an ancient gloss ac- counting for this outburst of tumultuous joy, by the words ὁ
῎Ιακχος yap ἥκει, the last two words of which crept from the margin into the text (ἐν χερσὶ γὰρ ἥκει τινάσσων), confounding both sense and metre, and giving an infinity of trouble before they were finally expelled.
351.
ἀνθηρὸν ἕλειον δάπεδον]
Though their first dance takes place before the Athenian Temple from which they start, they are ever looking forward to still more joyous and festive dances in an expanse which they call here the “ flowery marshy plain'';
in 373 infra the “fair-flowering bosoms of the meadows ”;
and in 448 infra the “flower-like rose- abounding meadows."
These are the Thriasian and Eleusinian plains, still brilliant'with many-coloured blossoms, and both commonly included under the one name of the Thriasian plain.
Mr. Dodwell (Tour through Greece, i. chap. ix) describes the surface of the Thriasian plain as “ variegated with the many- coloured anemone forming an expanded tissue of the richest hues."
He remarked there "at least twenty different tints of the red, the purple, and the blue,” and compares the " meadow enamelled with all the variegated hues of a field of anemones " to "a crowd of Greeks and Turks seen at a distance with their coloured turbans, with the predominant tints of red, blue, yellow, and white."
The Eleusinian plain is called ἕλειον, because it was frequently inundated bythe Eleusinian (to be distinguished from the Athenian) Cephisus, Demosthenes against Callicles 1279.
And certain mounds still visible there are supposed to represent the embankments which the Emperor Hadrian raised for the pur- pose of keeping its water within bounds, Leake, Topography of Athens, ii. 155.354. εὐφημεῖν χρή]
Now Iacchus is amongst his worshippers, and the pro- cession is eager to start :
but it cannot do so, until it has been purged of all profane and unworthy elements, έκὰς έκὰς ἐστὲ, βέβηλοι.
This solemn and im- posing ceremony took place, we may well believe, at the starting of the procession, as it certainly did at the actual initia- tion.
Nero, says Suetonius (Nero 34), " Eleusiniis sacris, quorum initiatione impii et scelerati voce praeconis submo- ventur, interesse non ausus est."
Here the duties of the præco are of course discharged by the Coryphaeus.
ἐξίστασθαι seems to have been the word regularly employed on these occasions, infra 370 ;
Iph. in Tauris 1226-9.
Aristophanes, however, except at the commencement and the close of the proclamation, drops its connexion with the Mysteries, and makes it the vehicle of his own comic satire.
Doubtless each of the prohibitions which follow, even when couched in the most general terms, has its particular application, but we can recognize it only in a very few instances.
357.
Κρατίνου τοῦ ταυροφάγου]
Just as, in the preceding line, the Muses took the place of Demeter and Persephone ;
so here, instead of warning off all who had not been initiated into their holy mysteries, the speaker warns off all who had not been initiated into the rites of Dionysus, the god of dramatic per- formances.
But whether because the deity in that particular character was already on the stage, or because the poet wished to pay a final compliment to an old rival long since deceased, he does not mention Dionysus by name, but makes Cratinus (than whom no more ardent votary of Dionysus, both as the god of the drama and as the god of(The warning-off of the profa.ne.)
All evil thoughts and profane be still:
far hence, far hence from our choirs depart, Who knows not well what the Mystics tell, or is not holy and pure of heart;
Who ne'er has the noble revelry learned, or danced the dance of the Muses high;
Or shared in the Bacchic rites which old bull-eating Cratinus's words supply;
Who vulgar coarse buffoonery loves, though all untimely the jests they make;
Or lives not easy and kind with all, or kindling faction forbears to slake, But fans the fire, from a base desire some pitiful gain for himself to reap ;
Or takes, in office, his gifts and bribes, while the city is tossed on the stormy deep;

For Sophocles, in the Tyro, as the Scholiast and others inform us, had spoken of Dionysus as ᾽Αριστοφάνης.
It is only as an epithet of the God that it is applied to Cratinus.
The words γλώττης βακχεῖα must be taken together, bacchic tongue-rites.358.
βωμολόχοις]
Possibly this refers to the tipsy buffoonery which Cleophon had exhibited in the Assembly a short time before the performance of this play, when after their defeat at Argi- nusae the Lacedaemonians had come to treat for peace, Aristotle's Polity of Athens, 34;
buffoonery which might not misbecome the comic stage, but which was altogether out of place (μὴ 'v καιρῷ) on the Athenian bema.
The persons who "fan the flames of hateful faction" are the mischievous agitators who stir up strife and party hatreds, and are the chief obstacles to that universal amnesty and reconciliation which Aristophanes had so deeply at heart, and which he will presently ad- vocate in the Epirrhema.361.

Of this unpatriotic toll-gatherer we know nothing beyond what is mentioned here, namely that he plotted the destruction of the city (cf. infra 381), and to that end supplied the enemy's fleet with oar-pads and pitch and sail-cloth, smuggling these pro- hibited articles, ἀπόρρητα, from Aegina to Epidaurus on the other side of the Saronic Gulf.
During the siege of Syra- cuse the Athenians had imposed upon their subject allies, in lieu of the ac- customed tribute, a five per cent.
duty on all exports and imports by sea.
—Thuc. vii. 28.
And no doubt, as Boeckh remarks (Public Economy, iii. 6), this was the εἰκοστὴ which Thorycion collected or farmed.
Meier (as quoted in Dr. Holden's Onomasticon Aristophaneum) conjectures that the treasonable act was committed during the rule of the Four Hundred, when the Peloponnesian fleet was stationed at Epidaurus, harrying Aegina, and apparently expecting an invitation to Athens from the more un- scrupulous partisans of Sparta there.- Thuc. viii. 92. But if so, it must have been only now detected, for Aristophanes, as the language in 381 infra more distinctly shows, is alluding to some- thing quite fresh in the minds of the audience;
there is nothing in the text to imply the presence of an hostile fleet in Epidaurus ;
and probably the event occurred when the Peloponnesians were refitting their fleet after the battle of Arginusae.
The Scholiast defines ἄσκωμα as δερμάτιόν τι, ᾧ ἐν ταῖς τριήρεσι χρῶναι, καθ᾽ ὄ ἡ κώπη βάλλεται.365.
τινὰ πείθει]
We do not know to whom this refers.

Here we light upon a well-known name ;
Κινησίας τοῦτο πεποίηκε, says the Scholiast;
and Aristo- phanes again alludes to the outrage in Eccl. 330, see supra 153.
And as to the ῾Εκάταια, little shrines and symbols of Hecate, erected at the house-doors, cross- ways, and elsewhere, see the note on Wasps 804.367.
τοὺς μισθοὺς τῶν ποιητῶν]
These are the money-payments awarded to the three competing comedians.
-Hesychius defines μισθὸς as τὸ ἔπαθλον τῶν κωμικῶν.
He adds ἔμμισθοι δὲ πέντε ἦσον, but this refers to a later period when five Comedies, and not as now three only, competed for the prize.
Argument to the Plutus, Aristotle's Polity of Athens, 56.
One only of the competitors gained the prize, but all were ἔμμισθοι.
Probably the μισθὸς was given when the play wasransmitting oarpads and sails and tar, that curst collector of five per cents.;
he knave who tries to procure supplies for the use of the enemy's armaments;
he Cyclian singer who dares befoul the Lady Hecate's wayside shrine;
he public speaker who once lampooned in our Bacchic feasts would, with heart malign, keep nibbling away the Comedians' pay;
—to these I utter my warning cry, charge them once, I charge them twice, I charge them thrice, that they draw not nigh o the sacred dance of the Mystic choir.
But YE, my comrades, awake the song, -he night-long revels of joy and mirth which ever of right to our feast belong.

Its amount is unknown.
The Scholiast mentions Archinus and Agyrrhius as the politicians who cut it down, οὗτοι, yop προἵστάμενοι τῆς δημοσίας τραπέζης τὸν μισθὸν τῶν κωμῳδῶν ἐμείωσαν κωμῳδηθέντες.
And the Scholiast on Eccl. 102 says ὁ ᾽Αγύρριος TOP μισθὸν τῶν ποιητῶν συνέτεμε καὶ πρῶτος ἐκκλησιαστικὸν δέδωκεν.
See the note there.
Agyrrhius was a mere dema- gogue :
but Archinus would probably be actuated by a genuine desire to economize the expenses of the Public Treasury, δημοσίας Tpaneζης.
He was the faithful friend and adviser of Thrasy- bulus during the eventful campaign, which commenced with the occupation of Phyle and ended with the famous Amnesty, and much of the credit for the moderation and wisdom, with which that campaign was conducted, is said to have been due to Archinus.
—Polity of Athens, 34 and 40, and Mr. Sandys' notes there.
The expression ρ̒ήτωρ ὢν εἶτα seems to mean that though he was a public speaker, and as such always attacking others, yet when he was him- self attacked by the comic poets, he stooped to this mean and unworthy revenge.
But there was never any love lost between the comic poets and the demagogues.

Now that all unworthy elements have been purged away, the procession commences its march.
The slow and stately pace at which they traverse the Cerameicus, is indicated by this little strophe composed entirely of spondees.

ἀλλ' ἔμβο]
As they depart from the city, they sing three hymns in succession, one to each of the Eleu- sinian deities, Persephone, Demeter, and Iacchus.
The hymn to Persephone constitutes the spondaic antistrophe 377-381.
She was widely known under the name of Σώτειρα.
Spanheim observes that she was so called on coins of Cyzicus, Κόρη Σώτειρα Κυζικηνῶν, and also refers to Pausanias (Laconica 13.
2), Αακεδαιμονίοις δὲ ἀπαντικρὺ τη̂ς 'Ολυμπίας 'ΑΦροδίτης ἐστὶ ναὸς Κόρης Σωτείρας ;
and Kock adds Pausanias (Arcadica 31. 1), τὴν Κόρην δὲ Σώτειραν καλου̂σιν οἱ 'Αρκάδες.

Who vows she'll still
Our city save to endless days, Whatever Thorycion's will.
Break off the measure, and change the time;
and now with chanting and hymns adorn Demeter, goddess mighty and high, the harvest-queen, the giver of corn.
(The processional hymn to Demeter.)
O Lady, over our rites presiding, Preserve and succour thy choral throng, And grant us all, in thy help confiding, To dance and revel the whole day long;
τὰς ἑτέρας, and Bergler to Thesm.
950, ἐκ τῶν ὡρῶν ἐς τὰς cupas.382. ἄγε νυ̂ν]
The Coryphaeus is now, apparently, discharging the duties of the Iacchagogus, and calling upon the Chorus to change the measure, and sing the hymn to Demeter.
And the second hymn 'at once follows, consisting of a dimeter iambic strophe and antistrophe each composed of five verses, four of which are acatalectic, and the fifth catalectic.
They have hitherto spoken of the all-night revelry, which is now concluding :
they here speak of the all- day journey (πανήμερον) which is now commencing.389.
γέλοια ... σπουδαῖα]
These ex- pressions are very suitable to the Mystic Procession, in whose language there was often a strange mixture of jest and earnest;
but the last words of the hymn, νικήσαντα ταινιου̂σθαι, show that Aristo- phanes is really thinking of his comic chorus, and of his success in the dramatic competition.
The Greeks combined the two ideas, γέλοια and σπουδαῖα, into one compound word σπουδογέλοιος, σπουδαιο- γέλοιος.394. ἀλλ' εἶα]
The voice of the Cory- phaeus is heard again, calling for the hymn to Iacchus, the god ever-young, ὡραῖον, young with the bloom of ever- lasting youth.
Spanheim refers to Catullus (Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis 252) "
At parte ex alia florens volitabat Iacchus " ;
and Ovid (Met. iv. 17) where the poet, addressing the god of many names, Bacchus, Bromius, Lyaeus, lacchus, &c., says- "Tibi inconsumta juventas, Tu puer aeternus, tu formosissimus alto Conspiceris caelo.
"The two lines νυ̂ν καὶ τὰν ὡραῖον ... τη̂σδε τη̂ς χορείας are in the fourteen- syllable Euripidean metre discussed in the note to Wasps 248 :
as are the four lines 441-447 infra commencing νυ̂ν ἱερὸν ἀνὰ κύκλον θεα̂ς.398.
”Ιακχε πολυτίμητε]
The hymn to lacchus consists of three stanzas, each containing six iambic lines, the final line in each stanza being the refrain, "Ιακχε Φιλοχορευτὰ, συμπρόπεμπέ με.
The first stanza exhorts the god to be the companion of their journey, πρὸς τὴν θεὸν, that is, to Demeter in Eleusis, telling him by way of inducement, that to him has been allotted the sweetest hymn of the three.
For the words μέλος ἑορτη̂ς ἥδιστον εὑρὼν mean having obtained (not having composed or invented) the sweetest festal lay.
AND MUCH in earnest, and much in jest, Worthy thy feast, may we speak therein.
And when we have bantered and laughed our best, The victors wreath be it ours to win.
Call we now the youthful god, call him hither without delay, Him who travels amongst his chorus, dancing along on the Sacred Way.
(The processional hymn to Iacchus.)
0, come with the joy of thy festival song, 0, come to the goddess, 0, mix with our throng Untired, though the journey be never so long.
O Lord of the frolic and dance, Iacchus, beside me advance!
For fun, and for cheapness, our dress thou hast rent,over twelve miles " says Mr. Louis Dyer (Gods of Greece, chap. 5).
It took Mr. Dodwell four hours and five minutes to traverse it on horseback (Tour, ii. 5).
And this procession was composed of a mixed multitude of both sexes and of various ages, mostly on foot, though some, especially ladies, went in their carriages.
The sacrifices, dances, and other observances would greatly prolong the journey and augment the fatigue ;
and the journey may well have taken them, as they intimate supra 387, the whole autumnal day.
But Iacchus him- self was never tired ;
a statue carried in loving arms he could ἄνευ πόνου (the phrase used by Dionysus of his own self-deliverance in Eur.
Bacchae 614, αὐτὸς ἐξέσωσ' ἐμαυτὸν ῥᾳδίως ἄνευ πόνου) have accomplished the longest distance.
The priest in whose arms he was borne was a stately and dignified official, and had a special seat assigned him in the front row of the Theatre, amongst those who sat on the right of the Priest of Dionysus (see the note on 297 supra) and immediately after the nine Archons :
Haigh's Attic Theatre, vii.
3. In this procession Iacchus was the only divine traveller.
He left Demeter and Per- sephone in the Athenian Temple:
he is journeying to Demeter and Persephone in the Eleusinian Temple.403.
σὺ yap κατεσχίσω]
The second and third stanzas indulge in the license which was a marked feature of these processions, and which of itself accounts for the split sandal, and the torn gar- ment, " Thou art he who split for mirth (and for economy) our sandal and our tattered gaberdine" (cf. Plutus 845), “and discovered a way for us to sportand to dance with perfect impunity."
Of the two expressions, ἐπὶ γέλωτι and in εὐτελείᾳ, the former applies to the Mystic procession, the latter (which is a sort of aside) to the comic chorus and the expense saved to the Choregus.
Not of course that there is any allusion to the manner in which the actual Choregus of the Frogs had equipped his chorus ;
for though some lines may have been added to a Comedy after its acceptance by the Archon, see Eccl.
1158-1162, yet it is incredible that any could have been introduced reflecting on the Choregus, who was already superintending its production.
The Scholiast tells its that according to Aristotle it was decreed in the archon- ship of Callias (the Callias who succeeded Antigenes), that the expenses of the choregia should be borne, not by a single citizen as theretofore, but by two conjointly :
a change which shows that in the altered condition of the city, the burden was felt more heavily than before, and that any saving in the repre- sentation would therefore be welcomed.406.
ἀζημίους]
The license enjoyed on these occasions might at other times bring retaliation and punishment, but now it is privileged :
now they who em- ploy it are ἀζήμιοι.416.
βούλεσθε κ.τ.λ.]
The time occu- pied by the three processional hymns has brought them (in imagination) to the bridge over the Athenian Cephisus, which is little more than a brook, and is at present bridged over by two blocks
Through thee we may dance to the top of our bent, Reviling, and jeering, and none will resent.
O Lord of the frolic and dance, Iacchus, beside me advance !
A sweet pretty girl I observed in the show, Her robe had been torn in the scuffle, and lo, There peeped through the tatters a bosom of snow.

Shall we all a merry joke At Archedemus poke,of marble, Dodwell, Tour, ii. 5.. Here the procession made a pause, and the processionists fell to abusing and jeering each other, " from whence," says Bentley (Phalaris, Age of Tragedy), "to abuse and jeer was called γεφυρίζειν." Strabo (ix. i. 24), describing the rivers of Attica, begins with ὁ Κηφισὸς, ῥέων διὰ TOV πεδίου, ἐφ' οὖκαὶ ἡ Γεφύρα καὶ οἱ Γεφυ- ρισμοί.417. 'Αρχέδημον]
During this pro- longed rehearsal of their old religious solemnities, it is only when some satiric work is to be done that the Mystics awake to the fact that they are, for this once, the Chorus of a comic play.
They now attack three unworthy Athenians, Archedemus, Cleisthenes, and Callias.
Archedemus, who seems to have been distinguished from others of the same name by the epithet of 6 γλάμων, the bleareyed (infra 588 ;
Lysias, adv. Alci- biadem, i. 25) is described by Lysias as a notorious debauchee and embezzler of the public money :
indeed he makes it a charge against his opponent (the son of the great Alcibiades) that he was intimate with a man of so depraved a character.
Here he is ridiculed as an alien, and the Scholiast says that Eupolis in the Baptae assailed him on the same ground.
But no doubt the present attack is really due to the fact that Archedemus was the first to com- mence hostilities against the victorious generals of Arginusae, Xen.
Hell.
i. 7. 2. Xenophon there describes him as 'Αρχέδημος, τότε προεστηκὼς ἐν 'Αθήναις καὶ Δεκελείας ἐπιμεκούμενος.
The expres- sion προεσηκὼς is equivalent to προστά- της ὤν, and corresponds to the δημαγωγεῖ of two lines below.
The words Δεκελείαςἐπιμελούμενος, if correct, probably mean that he was entrusted with the duty of watching the movements of the hostile garrison in Deceleia.418.
οὺκ ἒφυσε φράτορας]
He had been unable to prove his right to Athenian citizenship, and consequently had not been enrolled in any of the Athenian φρατρίαι.
Compare φυσάτω πἁππους in Birds 765.
But this meaning is con- veyed in language which refers to a child not cutting his second teeth in due time, that is at the age of seven:
Φράτ
ορας being substituted παρὰ προσδο- λίαν for Φραστη̂ρας, age-teeth, teeth which, as in the case of horses, serve to indicate the age of their owner, ἀντὶ του̂ εἰπεῖν ὀδόντας Φραστη̂ρας, says the 'Scholiast, Φράτορας εἶπεν.
Pliny (N. H. vii. 15) says “primores septimo mense gigni dentes, baud dubium est;
septimo eosdem deci- dere anno, aliosque suffici."
So Macro- bius, In Somn. Scip. i. 6, " Post annos septem dentes qui primi emerserant aliis aptioribus ad cibum solidum nas. centibus cedunt."
In the last scene of the Menaechmi, Menaechmus of Epi- damnus being asked his age when he was lost replied "Septuennis, nam tum dentes mihi cadebant primulum." Cf. also Juvenal, xiv. 10.420.
ἐν τοῖς ἄνω νεκροῖσι]
The Mystics, adopting apparently the suggestion of Euripides which is ridiculed infra 1082, 1477, consider that the dead are alive, and the living dead.
With them, accor- dingly, it is " Up among the dead men," not, as with the living, "Down among the dead men.
"Who has not cut his guildsmen yet, though seven years old;
Yet up among the dead
He is demagogue and head, And contrives the topmost place of the rascaldom to hold ?
And Cleisthenes, they say, Is among the tombs all day, Bewailing for his lover with a lamentable whine.
And Callias, I'm told, Has become a sailor bold, And casts a lion's hide o'er his members feminine.422. τὸν Κλεισθένη]
Aristophanes never loses an opportunity of lashing the effeminate vices of Cleisthenes.
We have already heard of him and them, supra 48 and 57.
In the Thesmophoria- zusae he is introduced on the stage, siding with the women, whose habits he declares are akin to his own.
Here he is represented as lamenting among the tombs, in more than womanly fashion, his lost male lover.
To this lover Aristophanes gives the name of " Sebinus of the Anaphlystian deme," both real names, though here employed πρὰς TO λακέμΦατον.
They are employed in the same, way in Eccl. 979, 980, where see the note.428.
Kaλλίαν]
Callias, the son of Hipponicus, the notorious spendthrift who squandered a princely fortune in the grossest debauchery, was another favourite object of Aristophanic satire.
He is here called the son, not of Hip- ponicus but of Hippobinus, to signify the dissipation which caused his ruin:
the Birds he is represented as a hoopoe whose feathers are falling off, and the poet explains his pitiable condition by saying that he is plucked by sycophants and women.
-Birds 285, 286.430. λεαντη̂ν
The Aethio- pians in the army of Xerxes are described by Herodotus (vii. 69) as παρδαλέας τεκαὶ λεοντέας ἐναμμένοι.
And in Birds 1250 Peisthetaerus describes the por- phyrions he is about to launch against Zeus as παρδαλα̂ς ἐνημμένους, whilst here the Chorus describe Callias as λεοντη̂ν ἐνημμένον.
But the λεοντη̂ which Callias is wearing is taken not from a lion but from a κύσθος.
The translation pro- ceeds on the reading κύσθῳ as signifying the part to be protected by the lion's skin.
But this would suit Cleisthenes rather than Callias.
It seems probable that Callias took part in the battle of Arginusae, and that some lover of Cleisthenes was slain there.431.
ἔχοιτ' ἄν]
Dionysus and Xanthias now emerge from their lurking-place and address the Chorus, who, Heracles had previously assured them (161 supra), would give them any information they might require.
Joining suddenly in the dialogue, they adopt the metre in which the Chorus are singing.436. ἀλλ' ἴσθ' κ.τ.λ.]
The Scholiast says TO ὁμοῖον λαὶ ἐν Γηρυτάδῃ, meaning, apparently, that there was a similar line in the lost comedy Gerytades, as there still is in Plutus 962.439.
Διὸς Κόρινθος]
What else is this but Δτὸς Κόρινθος in respect of the wraps?
Διὸς Κόρινθος, which is found again in the Ecclesiazusae, in Pindar's seventh Nemean, ad fin., and in the Euthydemus of Plato, chap.
six, is a proverbial ex- pression, applicable either to tedious iteration, as in the present passage, or to high-flown language with no corre- sponding results, as in Eccl. 828. Its origin is explained by the Scholiasts here and on Pindar.
'0 Κόρινθος, son of Zeus, was the eponymous Founder τη̂ς Κορίνθου, of the city of Corinth.
Megara, originally a dependency of Corinth, revolted from her at an early period, and ambassadors were sent to bring her to reason.
The Corinthian spokesman talked in the grand style, Ye do not honour τὸν Διὸς Κόρινθον, verily ὁ Διὸς Κόρινθ
ος is grieved at your conduct, and so on, with a perpetual introduction του̂ Διὸς Κορίνθου, till the Megarians lost all patience and set upon theDio.
Can any of you tell Where Pluto here may dwell, For we, sirs, are two strangers who were never here before?
CHOR.
0, then no further stray, Nor again enquire the way, For know that ye have journeyed to his very entrance-door.
Dio.
Take up the wraps, my ]ad.
XAN.
Now is not this too bad?
Like " Zeus's Corinth," he " the wraps " keeps saying o'er and o'er.
CHOR.
Now wheel your sacred dances through the glade with flowers bedight,speaker, crying Trate παῖε τὸν Διὸς Κόρινθον, and finally secured their independence by defeating the Corinthian troops.
But doubtless there is here, as Bergler in his translation suggested, a play upon the words Κόρινθος and Κόρεις, similar to that in Clouds 710.
"Fortasse etiam," says Bothe, "ridiculi causa simulat, dum stragula tollit, se pungi a cimice in iis latitante."
Without this allusion it is difficult to explain the words ἐν τοῖς στρώ- μασιν.
For few will accept Fritzsche's suggestion that the Corinthians may have stamped Corinthi conditoris ima- ginem in stragulis vere Corinthiacis, so that Xanthias really means An forte Jovis filius Corinthus stragulis meis inscriptus est ?"
This seems to make the line quite pointless.440. χωρεῑτε ... έορτῆς]
The Cory- phaeus again issues his instructions to the Chorus, who respond, 448 infra, with the words χωρῶμεν κ.τ.λ.
On the metre, see the note on 394 supra.
I have followed the common interpretation, Ducite nunc sacram choream Divae, per nemus floriferum ludentes.
- Bergler, Brunei.
Saltate in orbem choream du- centes.
-Thiersch.
Spanheim refers to Thesm.
953, where ἄγ’ ἐς κύκλον is a call to the dance ;
of. id. 968 εὐκύκλου χορείος. And Bergler adds Birds 1379 τί δεῦρο
πόδα σὺ κυλλὸν ἀνὰ κύκλον κυκλεῖς ;
Fritzsche proposed to translate it Ite nunc per sacrum septum deae,perfloriferum lucum, which certainly has the advantage of giving the same meaning to the preposi- tion ἀνὰ in each clause of the sentence.
He refers to Pollux i, segm. 10, who says οἱ δ’ ἀνειμένοι θεοῖς τόποι, ἄλση τε Kat τεμένη καὶ ἕρκη.
καὶ ό περὶ αὐτὰ κύκλος, περίβολος.
It is to be observed, how- ever, that Pollux does not say that the environment of a temple was called κύκλος ;
on the contrary he says, and truly, that it was called περίβαλος;
nor am I aware of any passage in which κύκλος is so employed.
And ἄλσος is not used here, as in Pollux, to signify "a consecrated grove."
See the following note.
Above all it is incredible that if the Coryphaeus were really directing the Chorus to go to a temple, they should in their response declare that they would go to quite a different destination.441.
ἄλσος]
He is referring to thegreat olive grove, extending on both sides of the Athenian Cephisus, at which they are now supposed to have arrived.
It is at the present time so remarkable a feature in the landscape that Lord Nugent, lpoking down from Athens on its ever-rippling leaves, was for a short time deceived into the belief that an arm of the sea was spreading itself along the plain before him (Lands Classical and Sacred, chap. i).
The trees, Mr. Dodwell says, are from 26 to 37 feet apart, and he and his party, riding from Athens to Eleusis along the Sacred Way, were 23 minutes in traversing the grove.
-Dodwell's Tour, vol. ii, chap.
5.446. οὖ παννυχίζουσιν θεᾷ]
Pausanias (Attica, xxxvii) mentions two temples of Demeter and Persephone in this portion of the Sacred Way, one on each side of the river Cephisus ;
and it may be that devout women would pass the night in one of them, as a quieter and more solemn place than could be found within the walls of Athens.448. χωρῶμεν]
Now they leave the river and grove of Cephisus, and are off to the Thriasian plain.
This final departure is signalized in a little strophe composed of one iambic tetrameter cata- lectic, and four glyconic lines.
Scholiast.
In the word καλλιχορώτατον in the following line, Kock fancies that there is an allusion to the well Calli- chorus over which the temple at Eleusis was built.
But this is very unlikely.
They are not speaking of the temple at Eleusis at all:
they are speaking of their coming dances in the Thriasian plain (see the note on 351 supra):
and no epithet can be more natural for their purpose than καλλιχ
ορώτοτον :
Eur. Phoen. 787, and passim.
The relative ὅν which follows is applied to χορὸν understood from καλλιχ
ορώτατον.453.
Μοῖραι]
At first sight it may seem strange that these solemn and mysterious beings should preside over festivities of dance and song.
It is possible (though I doubt it) that in the Birds they are represented as singing the hymenaean song at the wedding of Zeus and Hera —All ye who are partakers of the holy festal rite;
And I will with the women and the holy maidens go Where they keep the nightly vigil, an auspicious light to show.
(The departure for the Thriasian Plain.)
Now haste we to the roses,
And the meadows full of posies, Now haste we to the meadows
In our own old way, In choral dances blending, In dances never ending, Which only for the holy The Destinies array.
With just such a song hymenaean, Aforetime the Destinies led The King of the powers empyrean, The Ruler of Gods, to the bed Of Hera his beautiful bride!
Hymen, 0 Hymenaeus.—Birds 1731-6.And in Plato's Republic, x. 617 C. they are described as chanting the things which have been, and the things which are, and the things which are to be.
But these are functions of a totally different character.
Nor, perhaps, is it, more to the point to observe that they shared with the Graces the duty of escorting Persephone every year from the unseen world to the sunshine and gladness of spring.
See the Orphic Hymns (ed. Hermann), xliii.
7, where the Hours are calledThe key to the present passage is to be found in the epithet ὄλβιαι.
The Chorus, who have up to this point been acting and singing as if they were still living their mortal lives in the world above, are here, and still more fully in the antistrophe, assuming their real character as mystics who have passed through the gate of death and found life and immortality beyond.
To living men, the Μοῖραι appeared as stern and implacable executioners:
to the dead mystics, who are leading a far happier life after death than ever they led upon earth, they are bountiful and gracious goddesses, ὄλβιαι Μοῖραι :
just as in“ Sintram and his Companions," Death from a "stern companion," a " fearful monitor," becomes to the Christian Knight a "sweet and gentle friend."
It was these bounteous and kindly Μοῖραι who marshalled the mystic dances in the realms below.454.
ἥλιος K.T.X.]
See 155 supra.
On the general subject of this antistrophe, Spanheim cites (amongst other passages) a fragment of Sophocles preserved by Plutarch in his treatise De audiendis Poetis, chap. v, and Plato's Phaedo, chap. xxix, where Socrates says that the pure soul will be happy in the unseen world, ὥσπερ δὲ λέγεται κατὰ τῶν μεμυημένων, ὡς ἀληθῶς τὸν λοιπὸν χρόνον μετὰ τῶν θεῶν διάγουσα.
Since Lobeck's time it is rather the fashion to depreciate the Eleusinian Mysteries :
but it seems clear that in them were preserved and inculcated the two great fundamental truths of religion, viz. the Unity of God and the Immortality of Man.459.

With these words the great episode of the Mystic Procession concludes ;
the torches are extinguished, and are not relumed until the closing scene of the drama, infra 1524.

ΑΙΑΚΟΣ]
Aeacus, the grandsire of both Achilles and Aias. was a man of such singular integrity of life, that after death he was promoted to some position of trust in the kingdom of Hades.
He was generally regarded as a member of the august tribunal for judging the dead, with Minos and Rhadamanthus for his colleagues.
But Aristophanes assigns him the humbler post of doorkeeper in the hall of Pluto.
Bergler refers to Lucian's Twentieth Dialogue of the Dead,, where Menippus, on entering Hades, being shown by Aeacus some familiar objects, observes οἶδα ταῦτα, καὶ σὲ, ὅτι πυλωρεῖς.
So in the same writer's De Luctu 4, Aeacus is said to guard the entrance to Hades, with Cerberus by his side.
But Lucian was, probably, merely following in the steps of Aristophanes.465.
ὦ βδελυρέ]
The announcement that he is "Heracles the strong ” pro- cures for Dionysus a reception which he little expected.
The volley of abuse which the doorkeeper of Hades dis- charges at his head can only be com- pared with that which in the Peace is launched at Trygaeus by the caretaker of Zeus's celestial palace.
But there is more excuse for the present outburst, since Aeacus has been told and believes that the ravisher of Cerberus is standing before him.
The exclamation ὦ μιαρὲ καὶ παμμίαρε is of frequent occurrence in St. Chrysostom, Horn. in Matth.
xxxi. 358 A, lxxxi. 775 B ;
Horn. in Rom. xxii. 678 B (according to MS. Vat.), xxiv. 691 C ;
Horn. in 2 Cor. xxviii. 637 B and C, &c.
In this vituperative language the Scholiasts find a resemblance to that which, in the Euripidean tragedy bearing the name of Theseus, that hero addresses to Minos.
Thus on 467 theyAnd finally on 475 ἕστι δὲ ταῦτα ἐν Θησεῖ ποίζων.
It is to be observed, however, that the lines quoted do not bear the remotest resemblance to the language of Aeacus;
and it is very improbable that Aristophanes should be drawing upon a play which, being parodied in the Wasps, must have been produced at least eighteen years before.
Here Aeacus first threatens the intruder with the three rivers of Hades, the Styx, the Acheron, and the Cocytus ;
and then invokes three grisly spectres, the Echidna, the Muraena, and the Gorgons.
But everywhere, as we shall see, there is a vein of burlesque underlying his most terrible menaces.
470.
Στυγὸς μελανοκάρδι
ος πέτρα]
The Acheron and Cocytus are rivers of Epirus, and so, according to Homer (Iliad, ii. 755 ;
Od. x. 513), is the Styx ;
though later writers agree in making the Styx a cataract falling from the Aroanian mountains in the north of Arcady, and flowing into the river Crathis, which after traversing Achaia from south to north, enters the Corinthian gulf at Aegae.
We often hear of the water of Styx, Στυγὸς ὕδωρ, but only here of the rock of Styx, Στυγὸς πέτρο.
Now, no doubt, the cataract falls from a higher rock into a rocky basin, ἐκ πἐτρης καταλείβεται ἠλιβάτοιο, Hes.
Theogony 785 ;
ἀπὸ κρημνοῦ ἐμπίπτει is πέτρον, Pausanias, Arcadica xviii.
2. And the allusion here may possibly be to the rock over or into which the Styx falls:
but it seems more probable that Aeacus isO, villain, villain, arrant vilest villain !
Who seized our Cerberus by the throat, and fled, And ran, and rushed, and bolted, baling off
The dog, my charge !
But now I've got thee fast.
So close the Styx's inky-hearted rock, The blood-bedabbled peak of Acheron Shall hem thee in :
the hell-hounds of Cocytus Prowl round thee;
whilst the hundred-headed Aspspeaking of the Styx itself as a rock, and not as a river or waterfall.
μελανο- κάρδι
ος means "blackhearted" in the sense of evilhearted, a sense in which we still use the word (0 you little black- hearted thing is a lady's playful response to an urchin in one of Charles Reade's novels), rather than "of black basalt," as Mr. Paley thinks.
Aeacus is not describing the geological formation of the rock, he is trying to frighten his Cf. Ach.
321.471. ’Αχερόντιος σκόπελος]
Here again, instead of the stream, we hear of the peak of Acheron:
and here again, although there are plenty of peaks around the upper course of the Acheron (see the illustrations in Wordsworth's Greece, pp. 253-259), it seems probable that Aeacus is speaking of the Acheron as if it were itself a peak, and not a river.
As to the περίδρορμαι κύνες of Cocytus, which is a tributary of the Acheron, the Scholiast's observation is doubtless right, λέγει To? ’Ερινύας.
The culprit is to be guarded by the rocks of Styx and Acheron, whilst the Furies are ever running round, like hell-hounds, to make sure that he does not escape :
and the Asp, the Lamprey and the Gor- gons are savagely devouring his vitals.473. ῎Εχιδνα] Echidna (literally, Viper) is a well-known mythological personage, half woman and half serpent, λυγρὴ ῎Εχιδνα, baneful Echidna, as Hesiod calls her, in his description of herself and her horrible progeny, Cerberus, Chimaera, Hydra and others.

113. Of Muraena (literally Lamprey) the Scholiast says Μύραινα, δαίμων φοβερὰ, but she is not otherwise known in mythology.
The δνα and μύραινα, however, were always closely connected.

The deme was famous for its dried figs (Athenaeus, xiv. 67) and apparently of ill repute for its scolding women, who are here made to pass off for the Gorgons.
The burlesque run- ning through these denunciations in no way detracts from their overwhelming effect upon Dionysus.478. ἐφ’ ἅς]
As Beck observes, this line savours of the tragic Muse.
We shall find that when Aeacus returns he brings with him, instead of theseShall rive thy heart-strings:

ἐγκέχοδα• κάλει θεόν]
This is a, witty adaptation of the religious for- mula, ἐκκέχυται• κάλει θεὸν, which was employed when the Mystic feast was concluded, the final libation poured out, and the moment arrived for calling forth the god to his worshippers!
see Scholiast.
He gives other interpreta- tions, but I agree with Brunck that this is the true one.483.
πρόσθον. ΔΙ. ποῦ ’στιν The MSS.
and early editions give πρόσθον to Dionysus, and ποῦ ’στιν to Xanthias;
and so I have left the words in the translation:
but the middle form πρόσθου must necessarily be used to, and not by, Dionysus ;
and Dobree's arrangement, which is followed in the text, has been generally adopted by recent editors.
It is confirmed by 490 infra.493.
οὺ μὰ At, οὐδ’]
After οὐ μὰ Δί’ we must understand ἔδεισα.
No by Zeus, I feared them not, nor even gave them a thought.
The same words occur in the same sense in Plutus 704, where, in answer to the question "
Was not the god disgusted with your conduct?
Cario replies ov pa Δί’, οὐδ’ ἐφρόνιτσεν,
No by Zeus, nor did he even give it u thought.
The renderings of Bergler and Brunck, " Nihili feci, ita me Jupiter amet,” "Flocci non feci, ita me Jupiter amet," would require οὐκ in the place of οὐδὲ, as in 1043 infra.
The word οὐδὲ introduces a new branch of the sentence here, just as ἀλλὰ does infra 650.501.
OVK Μελίτης μαστιγίας]
Melite was a deme adjoining Collytus and the Cera- meicus, and containing, the Scholiast tells us, ἐπιφανέστατον ἱερὸν Ἡρακλέους ἀλεξικάκου.
He is probably speaking of the Theseium described by Pausanias in the seventeenth chapter of the Attica, which is generally identified (Leake's Topography of Athens, i. 166, and Appendix ix, though there are no doubt considerable difficulties in the way of that identification;
see Dyer's Ancient Athens, chap. viii) with the beautiful temple still existing in that quarter in almost perfect preservation.
For in Athens a temple of Theseus was also, as a rule, a temple of Heracles.
Theseus himself is said to have dedica- ted all his shrines but four to the worship of Heracles (Plutarch, Theseus, 35 ;
cf. Eurip.
Here. Fur. 1325-35).
The Athenians loved to draw more closely the ties which bound their local hero to his still more illustrious comrade, and Heracles was always a welcome guest in the Athenian homes of Theseus.
Speaking of the existing temple, Bp. Wordsworth of Lincoln observes:
“ The- seus did not enjoy alone the undivided honours of his own temple.
He ad- mitted Heracles, the friend and com-And shoutings ?
XAN.
Frightened ?
Not a bit.
I cared not.
Dio.
Come then, if you're so very brave a man, Will you be I, and take the heroes club
And lion's skin, since you're so monstrous plucky ?
And I'll be now the slave, and bear the luggage.
XAN.
Hand them across.
I cannot choose but take them.
And now observe the Xanthio-heracles If I'm a coward and a sneak like you.
Dio.
Nay, you're the rogue from Melite's own self.
And I'll pick up and carry on the traps.
MAID.
0 welcome, Heracles !
come in, sweetheart.
My Lady, when they told her, set to work,panion of his earthly toils, to a share in his posthumous glory.
He even ceded to him, with the best spirit of Athenian delicacy, the most honourable place in that fabric.
On the eastern facade of this temple all the ten metopes are occupied with the labours of Heracles, while only four, and those on the sides, refer to the deeds of Theseus.
The same disinterestedness is shown in the selection of the subjects of the two friezes of the pronaos and posticum of the cella.
Here, as before, Theseus has yielded to Heracles the most conspicuous spot at the very entrance of his own temple " (Athens and Attica, chap. xviii).
Xanthias is doubtless throwing him- self into the attitude of some well- known representation, whether statue, frieze, or painting, of Heracles in the Theseium.
The Scholiast mentions, or makes, the curious suggestion, that an allusion is intended to Callias, the son of Hipponicus, who is credited with the possession of a lion-skin, supra 430, and who, he says, had a residence in Melite ;
but this is extremely improbable:
and anyhow, any such allusion must be quite subordinate to the reference to Heracles as the scapegrace of Melite.503.
ὦ φίλταθ’ ἥκεις]
Dionysus has divested himself of the attire of Heracles at a most inopportune moment.
Whilst he carried the club and the lion-skin, they attracted nothing but threats and revilings, but no sooner has he doffed them than they receive the warmest welcome.
The maid-servant of Per- sephone runs out to invite the wearer to a splendid banquet prepared on a scale proportionate to the hero's traditional voracity.
A whole ox is to be broiled on the embers;
there are to be several bowls of that thick soup, after which his soul had so often lusted (supra 63, 64), whilst bread and rolls and honey-cakes, fillets of fish, game, sweetmeats and wine are to be provided in profusion.505.
κατερικτῶν]
Crushed by a hand- mill.
Of, Wasps 648, 649.
Here it is applied to beans, lentils, and other vegetables, crushed to a pulp, and then boiled with milk into a thick soup or broth.507.
πλακου̑ντας]
Honey-cakes.
As to the ingredients of which these cakes were composed, see the note on Eccl.
223. Κόλλαβοι (Peace 1196) were small rolls, of a milky-white colour, made of fresh wheat, and eaten het.
—Athenaeus, iii. 75. The Scholiast describes them as ἐοικότας τὴν πλάσιν τοȋς κολλύβοις τη̑ς κιθάρας, and indeed they seem to have derived their name from their similarity in shape to these pegs (more commonly called κόλλαπες) for relaxing or tighten- ing the strings of the lyre.508.
κάλλιστ’, ἐπαινῶ]
A polite way of declining.
So infra 512, 888. παραιτού- μενοί of παλαιοὶ ἔλεγον “ κάλλιστ’, ἐπαινῶ ” καὶ “ἐπή̜νουν.”—Scholiast.
The Latins used benigne, recte, bene, gratia est, in the same way.
Thus in the Mostellaria of Plautus, v. 2. 9, Theuropides, receiving a salutation and an invitation to supper, returns the salutation but adds, by way of declining the supper, de coena facio gratiam.
Our own language has, perhaps, no similar idiom ;
but Molière employs an exact equivalent in Le Dépit Amoureux, v. 3—Baked mighty loaves, boiled two or three tureens
Of lentil soup, roasted a prime ox whole, Made rolls and honey-cakes.
So come along.
XAN. (Declining.)
You are too kind.
MAID.
I will not let you go.
I will not LET you!
Why, she's stewing slices
Of juicy bird's-flesh, and she's making comfits, And tempering down her richest wine.
Come, dear, Come along in.
XAN. (Still declining.)
Pray thank her.
MAID.
0 you're jesting, I shall not let you off:
there's such a lovely Flute-girl all ready, and we've two or three Dancing-girls also.
XAN.
Eh ! what!
Dancing girls ?
MAID.
Young budding virgins, freshly tired and trimmed.
Come, dear, come in.
The cook was dishing up
The cutlets, and they are bringing in the tables.
XAN.
Then go you in, and tell those dancing-girls
Of whom you spake, I'm coming in Myself.
Pick up the traps, my lad, and follow me.
DIO.
Hi!
stop !
you're not in earnest, just becauseFritzsche supposes that καλῶς, thus used, means bene est ita ut oblata conditione uti nolim:
but this is an obvious mis- apprehension.
512.
ληρεȋς ἔχων] " You keep on play- ing the fool."
The ἔχων is not περιττὸν as the Scholiast thinks.
It would have been περιττὸν if employed on the first refusal of Xanthias.
516.
παρατετιλμέναι]
Trimmed.
ἐσπασ- μέναι τὰς ἐπανθούσας τῷ προσώπῳ τρίχας, καὶ ras τῶν ὀφρύων.
—Scholiast. " To eradicate all superfluous hairs formed," as Mr. Mitchell says, " an important operation of the Athenian toilet.
"519.
πρώτιστα rats ὀρχηστρίσιν]
He passes over Persephone, from whom the invitation came, and sends his message direct to the dancing-girls.
520.
αὐτός] Ἀντὶ του̑ ό δεσπότης.— Scholiast.
He speaks of himself as αὐτὸς, as a vaunt over Dionysus, to accentuate the fact that he is himself the master now, and Dionysus but the παȋς of the succeeding line.
534.
Ταυ̑τα μὲν κ.τ.λ.]
We now come to two little systems of dimeter trochaics, the counterparts of which will be found infra 590-604.
In each case the strophe is addressed by the Chorus to the wielder of the hero's club and lion-skin, here Dionysus, there Xanthias, whose reply is contained in the antistrophe.
Here the Chorus are applauding the worldly wisdom of Dionysus in keeping for him- self or handing over to Xanthias the garb and symbols of Heracles, according as the symptoms point to a friendly or a hostile reception.
They liken him to Theramenes, the shifty and versatile politician who passed with such ease and rapidity from one side to the other that he acquired the popular nickname of o Kóθορυς, the Slipper;
not indeed because, as the Scholiast here suggests, the κόθορνος was worn by both men and women, but because, as Xenophon tells us (Hellenics, ii. 3. 31), it could be worn indifferently on either foot.
See Lucian's Pseudologista 16.
Another brilliant little sketch, on the same lines, of the same statesman, is given infra 967-970.
They contain a happy and not unfair criticism on the whole career of Thera- menes, but are doubtless specially called forth at the present moment by his conduct after the battle of Arginusae.535.
πολλὰ περιπεπλευκότος]
Duker refers to what is said of Odysseus at the commencement of the Odyssey, and observes that Eustathius, in his com-I dressed you up, in fun, as Heracles ?

Dio.
Going to ?
No, I'm doing it now.
Off with that lion-skin.

CHOR.
This is the part of a dexterous clever Man with his wits about him ever, One who has travelled the world to see ;
Always to shift, and to keep through all Close to the sunny side of the wall ;
Not like a pictured block to be,mentary there, is obviously alluding to the passage before us, explaining, as he does, the epithet πολύτροπον by εὐκίνητον, οὐκ ἐφ’ ἐνὸς garriTa οἷα γεγραμ- μένην εἰκόνα.
However, the description here is not so much that of a man who πολλῶν ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω, as of a seaman who has sailed on many voyages, and well knows how to provide for his own safety in stormy weather, by avoiding the side which from time to time seems likely to be submerged, and keeping to that which for the moment is high and dry ;
" a thoroughly shrewd old salt," as Mr. Rudd translates the line.
For τοȋχος of course means the side of the vessel, and not, as in the translation, a wall generally.
The Scholiast on τοȋχον says ὅμοιον τῷ ἐν Ἀλκμήνη Εὐριπίδου, οὗτοι μεθίστανται.
See Eur. Orestes 885 and Porson's note.541.
οὐ γὰρ ἃν κ.τ.λ.]
Dionysus cheer- fully accepts the somewhat equivocal compliment paid him in the strophe, and draws a picture of what might have happened had Xanthias attended the banquet in the character of Heracles.
The ἀρχηστρίδες, it will be remembered, were the final inducement which led'Xan- thias to accept Persephone's invitation.
542.
Μιλησίοις]
The richly-dyed wools of Miletus were very famous in the ancient world, cf. Lys. 729 ;
and her manufacturers were renowned for their skill in working them up into rugs and carpets.
Virgil's allusions in the Georgics to the “ Milesian fleeces " are well known- Quamvis Milesia magno Vellera mutentur Tyrios incocta rubores.—iii.
306. Eam circum Milesia vellera nymphae Carpebant, hyali snturo fucata colore.—iv. 334.
Standing always in one position;
Nay but to veer, with expedition, And ever to catch the favouring breeze, This is the part of a shrewd tactician, This is to be a—THERAMENES !
Dio.
Truly an exquisite joke 'twould be, Him with a dancing girl to see, Lolling at ease on Milesian rugs;
Me, like a slave, beside him standing, Aught that he wants to his lordship handing ;
Then as the damsel fair he hugs, Seeing me all on fire to embrace her, He would perchance (for there's no man baser), Turning him round like a lazy lout, Straight on my mouth deliver a facer, Knocking my ivory choirmen out.
HOSTESS.
0 Plathane !
Plathane !
Here's that naughty man,548.
τοὺς χορούς τοὺς προσθίους]
He means his front teeth ;
but just as in Wasps 525, the old dicast, with his mind full of his dicastic pay, substitutes μισθὸν for κύλικα, thereby rendering his speech nonsensical, so here Dionysus, the lord of all dramatic choruses, and indeed at this moment addressing a chorus, substitutes χοροὺς for ὀδόντας with a similar result.
ἀντὶ του̑ εἰπεȋν ὀδόντας, εἶπεν χορούς. Διόνυσ
ος γάρ ὲστιν ὁ τῶν χορῶν προστάης.
τὸ δὲ ὅλον παρὰ τὴν ὑπόνοταν.
—Scholiast.
The word χορὸς, which often means a "row," was in later times occasionally applied by medical writers to a set of teeth.
Dindorf refers to Galen, De usu partium corporis hu- mani i. 8, aXX' εἰ μὲν χορόν τες ἔστησεν ἐν καὶ ταύτην ἐπαινεσόμεθα ;
But there is no allusion here to that usage of the word.
549.
Πλαθάνη κ.τ.λ.]
This second ex- change proves as inopportune as the first.
The attire of Heracles, when re- sumed by Dionysus, again becomes a mark for insult and abuse.
The real Heracles, it appears, on his visit to Hades, had not only carried off Cerberus, but also devoured, without payment, the entire contents of a cook-shop.
The two women to whom the hostelry belonged come in furious.
In the dialogue which ensues we have, as theScholiast observes, four speakers, πορα- τηρητέον ὅτι τέσσαρες ἐπὶ σκηνη̑ς διαλέ- γονται.
No doubt the three professional actors represented Dionysus, Xanthias, and the Hostess, whilst Plathane, who for an angry and excited female is singularly reticent, was represented by a choregic actor.552.
τινί]
Τῷ Διονύσῳ δηλονότι, says the Scholiast, and on τις two lines below, ὰντὶ του̑, ὁΔιόνυσς ὁ Ξανθίας δὲ ἠρέμα λαλεȋ.
See infra 606.
Xanthias is of course delighted at the turn things are taking, and is now poking fun at his unfortunate master.554. ἀν’ ἡμιωβολιαȋα]
Αξιον ἡμίσεοs ὀβολου̑ ἓν ἕκαστον.—Scholiast.
The lady does not seem to be speaking very good Greek, and Dionysus plucks up courage, for once, to repudiate the charge;
but thenceforth he is silent, overwhelmed by the clamour and volubility of these unexpected assailants.560.
ταλάροις]
The τάλαρ
ος was a wicker basket, in the shape of a cheese, into which the curd was introduced, and pressed until all the whey was strained out, and nothing remained but the dried cheese.
Mitchell refers to the story of the Cyclops in the ninth book of the Odyssey,That's he who got into our tavern once, And ate up sixteen loaves.

Hos. 0, you thought I shouldn't know you with your buskins on!
Ah, and I've not yet mentioned all that fish, No, nor the new-made cheese:
he gulped it down, Baskets and all, unlucky that we were.
And when I just alluded to the price, He looked so fierce, and bellowed like a bull.
XAN.
Yes, that's his way :
that's what he always does.
Hos. 0, and he drew his sword, and seemed quite mad.
PLA. 0, that he did.
Hos.
And terrified us so We sprang up to the cockloft, she and I.In modern times the cheese-press, or τυροβόλιον, is not a basket, but a wooden shape, perforated with holes.
Heracles makes no scruple of swallowing the baskets as well as the new cheeses they contained.566.
κατήλιφ’]
The κατη̑λιψ appears to have been a shelf or ledge running along the back of the cook-shop, and formed by the upper surface either of a cross-beam or of a partition not reaching to the ceiling.
Κατη̑λιψ με- Hesychius.
Photius, Pollux, Suidas, and other grammarians agree in explaining it by μεσόδμη, which is itself explained by Galen in his commentary on Hippo- crates, De Articulis iv. 41 (partly cited by Dr. Blaydes) as TO μέγα ξύλον τὸ ἀπὸledge articles for sale and household stores would be kept, and here in humbler dwellings the domestic fowls would roost.
As to household stores see Lucian (Lexiphanes 8), who, pur- posely affecting obsolete or out-of-the- way words, says o μέν τις ἐπὶ τὴν κατί-569.
Κλέωνα]
Aeacus had threatened Dionysus with all sorts of mythological horrors ;
the dead hostesses threaten him with the dead demagogues, Cleon and Hyperbolus.
The appellation προ- στάτης του̑ δήμου was the regular descrip- tion of the leading Athenian demagogue.
Of.
Knights 1128, Peace 684, Eccl. 176, Plutus 920, and Aristotle's Polity of Athens passim.574. TO βάραθρ
ον]
This was the pit or chasm at Athens, into which the corpses of slain malefactors were cast.
It is frequently mentioned in these comedies, and both in Aristophanes and elsewhere, ἐμβάλλειν is the verb uniformly em- ployed to express the act of flinging the criminals into it.
In its present condition it is described by Professor Mahaffy (Rambles in Greece, chap. iii) as a cleft in the rock, 200 yards long, 60 wide, and over 30 deep.
Euripides probably had the βάραθρ
ον in his mind when, in answer to the question of Orestes "What grave will receive my corpse ?" he makes Iphigeneia reply, χάσμα εὐρωπὸν πέτρας (Iph. in Taur. 626).
Then out he hurled, decamping with the rugs.
XAN.
That's his way too;
but something must be done.

See Schweighaeuser, at Athenaeus, xiv. 53, who observing that the second ex- planation ἒντερα has reference to χόλικας, suggests χόλικας here, a suggestion now universally adopted.
578.
έκπηνιεȋται]
Πηνίον is a ball of thread, έίλημα κρόκης (Scholiast on Il. xxiii, 762), έκπηνίζεσθαι to unwind the thread ;
here, to wind something out of a man, which is to be done by issuing writs and bringing accusations, a favourite practice of Cleon in his life- time, as Aristophanes knew by personal experience.
The Scholiasts explain προσκαλούμενος by έγκαλω̑ν, είς δικαστή-
ριον ἒλκων, κατηγορω̑ν αύτού.
With these words the women go out to fetch their bullies.579.
κάκιστ' άπολοίμην] "
Perdition catch my soul, but I do love thee," Othello, iii.
3. Mr. Puff, in Sheridan's Critic, iii.
1, admits that this line had been composed by Shakespeare some 200 years before it was composed by himself:
but Aristophanes seems to have said the same thing some 2,000 years before Shakespeare.
Dionysus wants to coax Xanthias into making a second exchange;
(φοβούμενος 6,Διό- νυσος, says the Scholiast, ύποκρίνεται φιλίαν πρὸς Ξανθίαν, ĩνα πάλιν 'Ηρακλη̑ς γένηται. Scholiast.587. ὴ γυνὴ, τὰ παιδία]
To involve one's family with oneself in a common im- precation, though laughably inapplic- able to the case of Dionysus, was, as Spanheim observes, a familiar formula at Athens.
He refers to Antiphon, "In the Matter of the Murder of Herodes," 11 ;
Andocides, "In the Matter of the Mysteries," 98;
Demosthenes against Aristocrates, 67, and other passages.
And Dr. Blaydes adds Demosthenes against Euergus, 70, εἰ διομεȋ έπὶ Παλ- λαδίω αὐτὸςκαὶ ὴ γυνὴ καὶ ra παιδία, καὶ καταράσεσθε αύτοȋς καὶ τη̑ αὶκίᾳ κ.τ.λ.
And cf.
Thesm.
349. Having such a sweep- ing imprecation in hand, Aristophanes utilizes it, παρὰ πρασδοκίαν, by including within its scope that " blear-eyed Arche- demus'' of whom we have already heard supra 417.
A slave, a mortal, act Alcmena's son!
Dio.
Aye, aye, I know you are vexed, and I deserve it, And if you pummel me, I won't complain.
But if I strip you of these togs again, Perdition seize myself, my wife, my children, And, most of all, that blear-eyed Archedemus.
XAN.
That oath contents me:
on those terms I take them.
CHOR.
Now that at last you appear once more, Wearing the garb that at first you wore.

σαυτὸν ἀεί]
These words are found in the old editions and several inferior MSS., but are omitted in the best MSS., and are possibly, as Beck suggested, borrowed from the corresponding line in the corresponding system, μετακυ- λίνδειν αὑτὸν ἀεὶ, supra 536.
Their omission makes the line too short by a trochaic dipody, which some have attempted to supply by πρὸς TO σαβαρὸν (from a gloss in the Oxford MS.), and others by πρὸς TO γαυ̑ρ
ον.
But these are pure conjectures, and certainly not more probable than the reading of the old editions.
For though ἀνανεάζειν is usually intransitive, it is not invariably so.
See Steph.
Thesaur. s. v. (Paris edition).600. ταυ̑τ' ἀφαιρεȋσθαι]
The Chorus have been warning Xanthias that he will lose the σχη̑μο, if he does not dis- play the λη̑μα, of Heracles:
but Xanthias,whilst admitting this, also observes that his retention of the hero's guise does not simply depend upon his own behaviour, for that his master, if he thinks it likely to bring any advantage to himself, will certainly, notwithstanding his oath, insist upon their making a third ex- change :
ὂμως δὲ, he goes on to say, if I may put into his mouth the words of the Platonic Socrates (Cratylus, chap. xxvi), ὂμως δὲ, ὲπειδήπερ τὴν λεοντη̑ν έν- δέδυκα, οὑκὰποδειλιατέον.604. ὀριγανον] 'Αντὶ του̑ δριμύ.

It is the dittany of Crete, a plant with " a piercing aromatic scent and biting taste."
See Miller and Martyn, s.v. origanum.
Span- heim refers to Theophrastus (Hist. Plant. i. 12 (1)), who, speaking of the juices (χυλω̑ν) of plants, says, .. Some are δριμεȋς, οἶον ὀριγάνου, θύμβρας, καρδάμου, νάπνος."
All these four plants are by Aristophanes, associated with βλέπειν.

However, before the three enter, or at all events before the attack on Xanthias is renewed, the latter makes a proposal which Aeacus accepts.

Dionysus, always siding against Xanthias, declares it to be a scandalous thing, that he should first steal Cerberus, and then assault the officers of justice who come to arrest him.
πρὸς, here, as elsewhere, is used adverbially.616.
τὸν παȋδα]
Dionysus is still con- gratulating himself on the adroitness with which, just at the right moment, he has transferred to Xanthias the dangerous honour of "the club and the tawny skin," when the tables aresuddenly turned, and he finds to his horror that although he has no longer the honour of representing Heracles the κυνοκλόπ
ος, he is nevertheless let in for the punishment of his misdeeds.
He had left out of his reckoning that strange but well-known custom whereby an accused person might prove his own innocence by tendering his slaves for the torture.
This custom, of proof by slave-torture, is constantly mentioned by the Attic orators :
a speaker always brags of his own readiness to submit his slaves to the torture, and always denounces the refusal of his opponent as evidence of the weakness of his case.
See (amongst many other passages) Antiphon, Against a stepmother, 6, 8, &c., In the matter of a Choreutes, 23 ;
Lysias, In the matter of Wounding with malice aforethought, 10-16, &c., In the matter of the Sacred Olive, 34- 37 ;

During the next few lines Dionysus is standing in a speechless agony of apprehension.

έν κλίμακι δήσας]
He takes a malicious pleasure in enumerating, for his master's benefit, the various tortures inflicted by the βασανισταἰ.
By κλĩμαξ we are to understand not an ordinary ladder, but an instrument of torture somewhat similar to the rack.

Κρεμάσας means that the slave was hung up, probably by his wrists, and left dangling in the air.

In the Trapeziticus of Isocrates (see the preceding note) the banker Pasion is described as having resorted to various subterfuges to prevent a slave (Κίττον τὸν παȋδα) who was privy to the deposit which his master denied, being submitted to the torture.
At length, however, he professed himself ready to tender him, προση̑λθεν ήμȋν, φάσκων ε̑τοιμος εἶναι 7rapa8ovvat βασανί- ζειν τὸν παȋδα.
Whereupon, says the speaker, ήξίουν αὺτοὺς μαστιγαυ̑ν τὸν έκδο- θέντα καὶ στρεβλου̑ν, ἒως ἂντἀληθη̑ δόξειεν αὺτοȋς λέγειν.
However, Pasion withdrew his offer.
δέρειν means " to flog his skin. off," " To pour vinegar into a man's nostrils " requires no explanation':
whilst the heaping a heavy pile of bricks on a man's chest is, as Dr. Merry observes, an obsolete penalty of our English pro- cedure.
It was employed to compel a man to speak who was obstinately silent.621.
πλὴν πράσῳ]
Most masters, in giving up a slave to be tortured, would, if they were not entirely destitute of humanity, stipulate that he should not be exposed to the most terrible tortures which might maim or injure him for life.
Here the slave, giving up his master to be tortured, does the very reverse, stipulating that he should not be exposed to a mere nominal torture which he would not feel.
625.
οὕτω]
On this understanding, without any more words or conditions.
Aeacus is to delay no longer, nor is the vigour of his arm to be restrained by any fear of liability even if Dionysus sinks under the torture.
Apparently this liability only arose when the accuser failed.
See the πρόκλησις at the close of the Oration (Demosthe- nes) against Neaera, to which, though for a different purpose, Bergler also refers.628. ἀγορεύω τινί]
The indefinite τικὶ is equivalent to our phrase " to all whom it may concern.
"637. δίκαιος 6 λόγος] Of. supra 623.
Xanthias, who as a slave has long been case-hardened to blows, is confident that he is less sensitive to pain, and has a greater power of endurance, than his delicate and voluptuous master ;
and he is therefore quite' willing to submit to his accustomed, provided that Dionysus is compelled to submit to an unaccus- tomed, flagellation.
By this means he escapes detection for the moment, and at the same time has the real satisfac- tion of seeing his master soundly whipped.

The next thirty lines are occupied with the whipping test.

seventh, whilst Xanthias has only three, the first, third, and fifth.
Both profess not even to feel their first blow ;
at the second Xanthias utters a whimper, which he passes off as due to his anticipation of some religious festival, whilst Dionysus cries out and his eyes .
fill with tears, for both of which symptoms he makes a very lame excuse;
when the third falls, Xanthias can no longer dissemble his pain, but attributes it, not to the blow, but to a thorn in his foot;
and both in his third and fourth Dionysus in agony shrieks out the name of a god, in each case endeavouring to treat it as the commencement of a poetic quotation.644.
ίδού]
This signifies " Ready! ! " as infra 1378, 1390, and frequently else- where.
Then the blow descends, and it is not until after its fall that Xanthias proceeds, "See if I shall flinch when you strike me," as if the blow were yet to come.
Aeacus treats the incredulous exclamation οὺ μἀ Δίο, as if it meant "I did not feel it," and rejoins "So indeed it seems to me."646. πηνίκα]
Beck says Anxietatem haec quaestio, de tempore quo verbera- turus sit, prodit."
But this is a mistake,the blow has already fallen, and Dionysus is in his turn pretending that he did not observe it.647.
οὐκἔπταραν]
How came it then that I did not sneeze ?
It is difficult to give any satisfactory explanation of the word ἔπταραν.
According to the Scholiast, Dionysus means that a blow from the scourge would affect him as little as the tickling of his nose with a straw, which would merely make him sneeze ;
and as he has not sneezed, how can he have received the blow ?
This is exceedingly far-fetched, and nothing can be more irrelevant than Conz's remark "sternutatio in ominibus bonis malisve habebatur."
I venture to suggest that for ἔπταραν we ought to read ἔπτα- KOV, the second aorist of πτήσσω, a form sufficiently authenticated by the com- pound καταπτακὼν in Aesch.
Eum. 243, How came it then that I did not flinch ?649.
ἰατταταῖ]
Such ejaculations as ἰατταταῖῖ, ἀτταταῖ, ἀππαπαῖ, παπαῖ, and the like had no determinate signification, and might with equal aptness express pleasure, pain, desire, surprise or any other emotion.
See Ach. 1190, 1198, Wasps 309, Lys. 924, Thesm. 223 and above 57, 63.
Here of course it is really a cry of pain, but Xanthias passes it off as a cry of longing for the merry- making of the Heracleian festival.
Fritzsche indeed takes an entirely dif- ferent view, contending that Xanthias admits his exclamation ἰατταταῖ to be a, cry of grief, but pretends, in his character of Heracles, to be grieving at the suspension of his own Diomeian festival.
He suggests (1) that " in tanto tamque aperto dolore, risus atque hi- laritas ne fingi quidem commode po- terat."
(2) That possibly " Athenienses inter tot belli curas magnum Herculis festum in Diomeensium page celebrari solitum intermiserant," and thirdly that " Xanthias-Hercules minime plagis se doluisse ait, sed sollicitum fuisse sa- crorum suorum intermissione."
The first suggestion is against the spirit of the whole scene, and Fritzsche himself altogether ignores it four lines below, where he says that " Dionysus fingit se equitibus subito in conspectum datis laetatum, quia ἰσὐ non solum dolorem exprimit, sed etiam effuse gaudentis est."
The second suggestion is without a particle of authority or (considering the deme's position) of probability;
whilst the third seems completely dis-AEAC.
I struck you.
Dio.
Struck me ?
Then why didn't I sneeze ?
AEAC.
Don't know, I'm sure.
I'll try the other again.
XAN.
And quickly too.
Good gracious !
AEAC.
Why " good gracious ”?
Not hurt you, did I ?
XAN.
No, I merely thought of The Diomeian feast of Heracles.
AEAC.
A holy man !
'Tis now the others turn.

Hi Hi!

Hallo !
Dio.
Look at those horsemen, look !
AEAC.
But why these tears ?

posed of by the comment of Aeacus, ἂνθρωπος ἱερὸς, an expression as inap- plicable to a god mourning over his lost honours, as it is applicable to it worshipper anticipating with joy the approach of a religious festival.
And, in truth, throughout this whipping scene, Dionysus does not keep up his character of, Dionysus, nor Xanthias his assumed character of Heracles.651.
‘Ηράκλεια τἀνΔιομείοις]
The festival in honour of Heracles within the precincts τοῦ ‘Ηρακληῑου τοῦ ἐνΚυτο- σάργεἲ (as Hdt. calls it v. 63, vi. 116) seems to have been celebrated with an abundance of buffoonery which would be dear to the soul of Xanthias ;
and doubtless at some stage of the proceed- ings the cry of ἰατταταῖ was, as Conz also suggests, loudly raised by the as- sembled worshippers.
Kock refers to the account given by Athenaeus, xiv. 3, of sixty jesters who in the following century frequented this particular temple.
Philip of Macedon, we are told, gave them a talent to write down their jokes and send them to himself.
Cynosarges was a locality in the extra- mural portion of the deme Διόμειοι which extended on both sides of the gates thence called the Διάμειαι πύλαι.
There was a tradition that whilst Diomus was offering a sacrifice, a white dog, passing along, ran off with'the meat and hid it in some secret place.
An oracle di- rected Diomus to erect an.
altar to Heracles on the spot where the meat had been hidden.
The spot was dis- covered, and from the white dog was called Κυνόσαργες, and about it was erected the famous Temple of Heracles.
The story is told, with variations, by almost all the old grammarians.
653.
ἰοὐ ἰαὐ]
Here we have another exclamation of dubious import.
As originally uttered by Dionysus, it was of course a shriek of agony, which he tries to pass off as a shout of excitement at seeing some horsemen go by.
This, however, as Aeacus observes, does not account for the tears which suffuse his eyes ;
and for these he has to resort to another explanation, attributing them to a sudden smell of onions;
cf. Lys. 798.
Mine eyes smell onions, I shall weep anon, says old Lafeu in the closing scene of All's Well that Ends Well.
And Shakespeare introduces the same notion in Antony and Cleopatra, and the Taming of the Shrew.657.

And the audience would not pause to consider whether the sensation of pain was a less disproof of his divinity when occasioned by a, thorn than when occa- sioned by a blow.
But there is no need to attribute the mention of Hipponax to any pain or flurry on the part of Dionysus.
The scanty poems of Ananius were always appended to the more ample writings of Hipponax, and were often quoted under his name.
Only four fragments of the iambics of Ananius are still ex- tant (see Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci);
and of these there is but one which is not also ascribed to Hipponax.664. Πόσειδον]
In his eagerness to carry out the suggestion of Xanthias, Aeacus forgets that the next blow belonged of right to Xanthias himself, and accordingly inflicts two in succes.
sion upon Dionysus.
To redress this injustice, Mr. Green would give the words Πόσειδον ... ὂς Αἰγαίου K.T.X. to Xanthias, and ἥλγησέν τις to Dionysus,, so that the latter words would, be a. retort to the ἥλγησεν.

No, by Demeter, still I can't find out Which is the god, but come ye both indoors ;
My lord himself and Persephassa there,lines above :
compare 606 supra.
But though I was at one time much taken with this suggestion, I am now satisfied that the MS.
arrangement is correct.
To make Xanthias prepare a rod for his own back (a very inappropriate metaphor, however) would be to turn the laugh against him, and in favour of Dionysus, which is quite contrary to the relation in which the pair stand towards each other:
nor would the literary abilities of the slave, which are only equal to the idea about the thorn, soar to the height of the quota- tion and song.
Here, as before, the name of the god is a mere involuntary exclamation, and is only by an after- thought turned into the commencement of a lyrical sentence.
The Scholiast says, παρὰ τὰ ΣοΦοκλέους ἐκ Λαοκόωντος " Πόσειδον, ὂς Αἰγαίαυ μέδεις πρῶνας, ὴ γλαυκᾶς μέSets εὐανέμου λίμνας, ἐΦ’ ὑψηλαῖς σπιλάδεσσι στομάτν.”
This is obviously corrupt, but it cannot be amended with certainty.
668. σὐ δὑναμαι] ’Αμφότεροι γὰρ ὼδυνή- θησαν.—Scholiast. " Non potest cogno- scere uter sit Deus, quia ambo dolorem dissimulare non poterant.”—Bergler.
But the meaning is the very reverse.
Aeacus had accepted their explanations in simple good faith, and believed that neither had flinched.
Had he taken the ”Απολλον in 659 for a shriek of pain, he would at once have closed the inquiry, and concluded Dionysus εἶναι μὴ θεὸν, supra 639;
whereas the remark of Xanthias, οὐδἐνποιεῖς γὑρ, and the reply of Aeacus, μἀ τὸν Δία, No more I do, show plainly that the test had so far failed.
Aeacus swears by Demeter, as is becoming in a servant of Hades.673.
πληγὰς λαβεῖν]
The actors retire from the stage, and the Chorus, turning to the audience, commence the last Parabasis which has come down to our days.
It is not a complete Parabasis like those of the Acharnians, the Knights, the Wasps, and the Birds.
It answers to the second or shorter Para basis of the Knights and the Birds.
The Para- basis Proper is gone, and with it the Commation which introduced it, and the Pnigos with which it concluded.
The last four parts alone remain :
the Strophe and Epirrhema :
and the Anti- strophe and Antepirrhema.674-685.
Μοῦσα κ.τ.λ.]
THE STROPHE.
The commencement of the Strophe is obviously borrowed from some tragic poet, and as we know that the com- mencement of the Antistrophe is taken from Ion of Chios, we may perhaps not unreasonably infer that we are here also listening to his words.
It seems to me that the actual quotation or parody goes down to and includes the word φιλοτιμότεραι, Aristophanes sub- stituting the name Κλεοφῶντος for the high-flown genitives of the original as well for the sake of raising a laugh at the unexpected bathos, as for the purpose of indulging in a fling at that pernicious demagogue.
I take it, how- ever, that the language of Ion is more or less adapted, though of course wrested from its proper context, throughout the remainder of the Strophe.674.
χορῶν ἱερῶν ἐπίβηθι]
Commence the sacred choral dance and song.
They speak of the Muse as of a charioteer mounting upon her car.
Compare Hesiod (W. and D. 658, 659), The Scholiast says that the Muse here invoked is Terpsichore, and this is perhaps implied by the juxtaposition of the words χορῶνand τέρψιν.

Κλεοφῶντος]
The political folly of this demagogic lyre-maker, who in the violence of his oratory out-Cleoned Cleon, is attacked at the close of the play, where see the notes.
Here the satire turns on the strain of Thracian blood which he derived from his mother.
The Scholiast tells us that in the Cleo- phon of Plato, which competed with the Frogs, she was represented on the stage speaking broken Greek.
See the remarks on that play in the Introduc- tion.
In this and the three following lines almost every expression points to the semi-Thracian origin of Cleophon, "upon whose double-speaking lips the Thracian swallow is terribly roaring, as she sits perched on that barbarian leafage."
The word ἀμφιλάλοις was formerly taken to mean simply garrulous, but almost all recent editors consider it to signify chattering in two dialects (the Attic and the Thracian) like ἀμφί- γλωσσ
ος, with which Mr, Green com- pares it.
The βάρβαρον πέταλον is another description of the same perch.
The "Thracian swallow" is a very happy expression.
The swallow's song was always compared to a foreign tongue.
Bergler cites Agamemnon 1013, where the Scholiast says, on βάρβαρον τὸ ὄρνεον, διὰ TOVTO παραβάλλει TOVTO αὐτῇ· ἐνθρᾴκῃ yap ἡ μεταμόρφωσις αὐτῆςἱστό- ρηται, and Bp. Blomfield refers to Hesychius, s.v. χελιδόσι·τοὺς βαράρ
ους χελιδόσιν ἀπεικάζουσι διὰ τὴν ἀσύνθετον λαλιάν.
See also the Scholiast on Birds 1680.
The epithet θρῃκία was as appro- priate to the swallow-since it was in Thrace that Procne and Philomela were metamorphosed, the one into a swallow and the other into a nightingale-as it was apt for the poet's satire upon the Thracian origin of Cleophon.
At the same time it was far from his intention to attribute to the demagogue the musical notes of the swallow, and there- fore the bird on Cleophon's lips does not warble but δεινὸν ἐπιβρέται (cf. infra 814), makes aterrible roaring.
Itis Cleophon's voice, and not her own, that issues from the swallow's throat.683.
àηδόνιον]
It would never occur to us to couple the swallow's song with that of the nightingale, but it was otherwise with the Greeks:
with them the two songs were constantly men- tioned together.
When Apollo first came to Delphi, sang Alcaeus in the paean of which Himerius has left us a paraphrase, ἄδουσι μὲν ἀηδόνες αὐτῷ, ἄδουσιδὲ καὶ χελιδόνες (Bergk, Alcaei Fragm. 3). Lucian, in his Veracious History, ii. 15, tells of a chorus com- posed ἐκκύκνωνκαὶ χελιδόνων Kat ἀηδόνων, and when they sing, he adds, πᾶσαη ὔλη ἐπουλεῖ.
Of.
Id. Philopatris, 3. And Lon- gus, in his Pastorals, ii.
3, says that οὔτε χελιδὼν, οὔτεἀηδὼν, οὔτε κύκνοςhas so sweet and musical a voice as that of newly- found Love.
Whether this conjunction is the cause, or the result, of the legend of Procne and Philomela, it is perhaps impossible to say.
Here the swallow borrows her sister's song, because her own is brisk and cheerful (see the note on Peace 800):
and in order to celebrate on Cleophon's lips his own approach- ing destruction, she needs the wailing, dirge-like notes of the bird who, in the beautiful dactylics of Sophocles, is called simply a στονόεσσα,685.
κἄν ἲσαιγένωνται]
A! ψῆφοι δηλο- νότι, says the Scholiast, that is, the votes for and against him :
an equality which ought to ensure an acquittal.
For this was the great principle laid down for all time by Athene at the trial of Orestes before the Athenian Areopagus, νικᾶν ἲσαις ψήφοισι TOV φεύ- γοντ'ἀεί.
Many passages bearing on this rule of Athenian judicature are discussed by C. O. Müller in his Disser- tations on the Eumenides, Appendix i, to which may be added Aeschines against Ctesiphon, 253.
It is thought that some capital charge was impend- ing over Cleophon at this moment, and if these words imply that he expected to be convicted by some illegal pro- ceeding, his fear was, according to Lysias, abundantly justified.
See the note on 1505 infra.686-705.
THE EPIRRHEMA.
It was chiefly to this Epirrhema that the play was indebted for the unique honour ofThere is shrieking, his kinsman by race, The garrulous swallow of Thrace ;
From that perch of exotic descent, Rejoicing her sorrow to vent, She pours to her spirits coptent, a nightingale's woful lament, That e'en though the voting be equal, his ruin will soon be the sequel.
Well it suits the holy Chorus evermore with counsel wisea second representation, and the poet for the glory of receiving, not merely the usual wreath of ivy, but a special wreath formed of branches of the Sacred Olive:
the final tribute of the Imperial City, not to his wit or his genius, but to the exalted and con- sistent patriotism which had distin- guished his entire career.
Here he pleads for sinking all differences in this hour of peril:
for re-enfranchising all the disfranchised, specially those citizens of pure Athenian blood who had incurred the enmity of the demo- cracy by their connexion with the revolu- tion of the Four Hundred, and who had consequently, for the space of several anxious years, been deprived of all rights of citizenship.
See Lysias, Δήμου καταλύσεως ἀπολογία, § 35.
He ascribes their fall to the wrestling-tricks of Phrynichus, the Athenian general, the most zealous promoter of that revolu- tion ;
παρέσχε δὲ καὶ φρύνιχος έαυτὸν πάντων διαφερόντως προθυμότατον ἐς τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν.
-Thuc. viii. 68.
On this account,.
and because he was strongly suspected of twice attempting to betray his country to the enemy, his memory was especially obnoxious to the Athenian people.
In the oration of Lysias, For Polystratus, § 11, it is said that for purposes of prejudice Polystratus was alleged to be a kinsman of Phrynichus ;
but this, the speaker declares, was a calumny (ψευδῆ κατηγόρουν) ;
he was not a kinsman, he was merely a fellow burgher of Phrynichus :
and if this is a crime, it must also be a crime to be his fellow citizen, as all the Athenians were.
Many, he adds, were led astray by Phrynichus and Peisander who were really good and loyal citizens.
The poet's advice, applauded at the moment, was carried into effect before the year was over.
Immediately after the dis- aster of Aegospotami, a decree was passed, on the motion of Patrocleides, τοὺς ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμους ποιῆσαι.——Xen.

All dramatic choruses were ἱεροὶχοροὶ, as forming part of the worship and festival of Dionysus.
But the Chorus of the Frogs was invested with special sanctity from its sacred mystical character.
This vindication of the right and duty of the sacred Chorus to tender its advice to the State seems to betray some doubt and some anxiety on the part of the poet as to the reception which theadvice he was about to offer would obtain from the audience.688.

But when the speaker has concluded the first half of his sentence, he per- ceives that he may seem to be dis- approving of the enfranchisement of the slaves, and therefore breaks off to say, parenthetically, Not that I object to that measure;
on the contrary, I heartily applaud it.
And then, resuming, he does not take up the unfinished sen- tence, but concludes, as if he were con- tinuing the parenthesis, but ye should not lea ve genuine Athenians disfranchised.
Scholiast.
The decree regulating the status of the Plataeans on their ad- mission to Athenian citizenship is givenTo exhort and teach the city :
this we therefore now advise-
End the townsmen's apprehensions ;
equalize the rights of all;
If by Phrynichus's wrestlings some perchance sustained a fall, Yet to these 'tis surely open, having put away their sin, For their slips and vacillations pardon at your hands to win.
Give your brethren back their franchise.
Sin and shame it were that slaves,
Who have once with stern devotion fought your battle on the waves, Should be straightway lords and masters, yea Plataeans fully blown-
Not that this deserves our censure;
there I praise you;
there alone Has the city, in her anguish, policy and wisdom shown-
Nay but these, of old accustomed on our ships to fight and win, (They, their fathers too before them), these our very kith and kin, You should likewise, when they ask you, pardon for their single sin.
O by nature best and wisest, 0 relax your jealous ire, Let us all the world as kinsfolk and as citizens acquire,in the oration [Demosthenes] in Neae- ram, § 104.
They were to be enrolled in Athenian tribes and denies, and -to have every privilege of Athenian citi- zens, save only that the individuals first enrolled were not, though their de- scendants were, to be eligible for the archonship and certain family priest- hoods.
The slaves who fought at Ar- ginusae were admitted to the citizen- ship on the same terms.
It would have been very objectionable for a man who had himself been an actual slave to become an archon or a member of one of the sacred colleges :
but even this privilege was not withheld from his descendants.
697.
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις]
Bergler placed a comma after δὲ, treating πρὸς as an adverb;
and his construction is very generally followed.
But πρὸς τούτοις is the commonest possible expression for besides, and had Aristophanes used πρὸς adverbially, it is incredible that he should have made an unnecessary am- biguity by immediately subjoining τού- τοις.
There is, of course, no need for τούτοις to be expressed after παρει̑νσι.699.
μίαν]
As the πολλὰ ἐναυμάχησαν of lines 697, 698 is intended as a con- trast to the ναυμαχήσαντας μίαν of 693, so here again μίαν ξυμΦορὰν is con- trasted, though in a different way, with the μίαν [νανμαχίαν] there.
The enfran- chised slaves had fought but one battle ;
the disfranchised Athenians had com- mitted but one fault, ξυμΦορὰν is used delicately, as Mitchell observes, for ἁμαρτίαν.701.
πάντας ἀνθρω̍πους]
"This," says Dr. Merry, "is limited, of course, to those at Athens."
To me, on the con-trary, the whole force of the passage seems to consist in the utter absence of all limit and restriction.
"Let us not reject anybody in the wide world," says the poet, "who is willing to fight on our ships, be he kinsman or stranger, Greek or barbarian, bond or free."
He is now going beyond his plea for re- enfranchisement, and is arguing for an extension of the citizenship to all who will help the city in her hour of need.
θέλει δὲ εἰπει̑ν, καὶ ταυ̑τα ὂντες ἐν πολλοι̑ς κινδύνοις.—Scholiast, ἔχοντες is taken by Brunck, Elmsley (on Bacch. 89), and others to be equivalent to ὄντες, but it .seems far better to understand τήν πόλιν from the commencement of the line.
If ive grow puffed up and are high and mighty about the city (meaning, of course, with regard to the right of citizenship), and that, too, when she is reeling (literally, when we have her) in the embraces of the wares, &c.706-717.
THE ANTISTROPHE.
The Strophe dealt with the well-known Cleophon, the Antistrophe deals with the utterly unknown Cleigenes.
He is here described as a worthless and quareelsome little bathman, but had that been all he would never have occupied a niche in the Parabasis of the Frogs.
We may be sure that he was a politician of the same type as Cleophon, and therefore an opponent of peace with Sparta, a circumstance not ob- scurely intimated by the words ούκ εἰρηνικός ἐστι.
A Scholiast begins Φαίνεται δὲ ὁ Κλειγένης περὶ τὰ πολιτικὰ, but does not finish his sentence.
If Fritzsche is right in identifying him with the Κλεογένης ὲγραμμάτευεν of a decree cited by Andocides de Mysteriis, 96, he may have been one of the very ὑπογραμματέων against whom Aristophanes inveighs, infra 1084.
And, anyhow, πίθηκος here is doubtless used in the same sense as δημοπιθήκων there.
The bath businessAll who on our ships will battle well and bravely by our side.
If we cocker up our city, narrowing her with senseless pride, Now when she is rocked and reeling in the cradles of the sea, Here again will after ages deem we acted brainlessly.
And 0 if I'm able to scan the habits and life of a man
Who shall rue his iniquities soon !
not long shall that little baboon, That Cleigenes shifty and small, the wickedest bathman of all

was probably his father's trade, and perhaps in early youth his own.706. εἰ δ' έγω̍
The opening words, as the Scholiast informs us, are borrowed from the Φαι̑νιξ ἢ Καινεὐς (according to Bentley's certain emendation Ep. ad Mill. ii. 311, Dyce) of Ion of Chios, where they formed part of the following hexameter, Blaydes would like to change ἀρθὰς into οἷος because " inaudita et insolens lo- cutio est ἀρθὸς ἰδει̑ν,"as if that were not, . in all probability, the very reason for which Aristophanes quotes it.
λαυαμέναις σμήγματα.—Scholiast. " De balneatore loquitur," says Fritzsche, "tanquam de magno rege Persarum, ὁπόσοι κρατου̑σι γη̑ς."
It may be that the words are still a reminiscence of Ion of Chios, and were in his tragedy applied to some magnificent personages.
τω̑ν βαλανέωνπωλαύντων.—Scholiast.
The various articles mentioned are discussed in Beckmann's History of Inventions, under the title "soap." κανία is the lye of ashes, τὺ ἐκ τέΦρας καθιστάμενον ὑγρόν.
—Pollux, vii, segm.
40. The epi- thet κικησιτέΦρον seems to imply that the lye has still some solid ashes mixed with it.
λίτραν (the Attic form of νίτραν) is a fixed lixivious alkali, similar to, though not identical with, the salt which we now call nitre.
As the lye was not pure but mixed with ashes, so the very alkali was adulterated.
For this charge of dishonest dealing on the part of the tradesmen, I could not in my translation find room.
Κιμωλὶα γη̑ was the white chalky soil of Cimolus, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, immediately to the north of Melos.
It answered the purposes of our fuller's earth.αὐτω̑ ἀπειλου̑σι.—Scholiast.
But though he knows that his time is short, he is not inclined for peace, but carries a cudgel, lest, if he were walking without one, he should be stripped by footpads in one of his drunken fits.
The words οὐκ εἰρηνικός ἐστι, though really aimed at his political views, are woven into a description of his personal habits and lead up to a final charge of drunkenness.718-737.
THE ANTEPIRRHEMA.
The presence of a Spartan detachment at Deceleia had doubtless, as was antici- pated (Thuc. vi. 91), suspended for a time the working of the silver mines of Laureium.
Hitherto the Athenian mint had issued silver only, but when this ἀργύρου πηγὴ was temporarily closed the Athenians had for the first time to resort to other devices for obtaining a supply of coin.
In the archonship of Antigenes, B. c. 407—6 (see the Scho- liast on 720), certain gold statues of Victory were sent to the mint, and coined into money.
This was doubtless a pure gold coinage;
the gold on the statues and offerings had, at the com- mencement of the war, been reckoned by Pericles (Thuc. ii. 13) as one of the chief financial resources of the State, and all " the gold coins which have been handed down to us are of ex- cellent quality."
—Head's Preface to the British Museum Catalogue of Greek Coins, Attica, &c."
But this supply was insufficient for the commercial necessities of the Athenian people, and indeed it would have been impossible to produce in gold the small change required for every-day use.
Even in silver the fractions of an obol are scarcely larger than the little lady-birds of our gardens.
Accordingly in the following year, B. c. 406-5, in the ar- chonship of Callias (in the latter half of whose archonship this play was pro- duced), a new experiment was tried, and copper (or, to speak strictly, bronze) coins were, for the first time, issued from the Athenian mint.
Aristophanes, in the Antepirrhema, seizes upon the comparative disuse of their splendid silver and gold coinage, and the sub- stitution of this inferior and manu- factured metal, to lecture the audience on the unwisdom of their analogous policy in excluding the educated and genuine citizens of pure Athenian bloodAnd this the unlucky one knows, Yet ventures a peace to oppose, And being addicted to blows he carries a stick as he goes, Lest while he is tipsy and reeling, some robber his cloak should be stealing.
Often has it crossed my fancy, that the city loves to deal
With the very best and noblest members of her commonweal, Just as with our ancient coinage, and the newly-minted gold.
from offices of state, and filling such offices with alien adventurers, half- breeds and the like.
Strange to say, the Scholiasts and commentators take τὸ καινὸν χρυσίον of line 720 to be identi- cal with rots πονηροι̑ς χαλκίοις of line 725, and so get themselves into all manner of difficulties, from which later commentators endeavour to extricate themselves by various alterations of the text.
To opxatov νόμισμα, the imme- morial silver coins issued before the closing of the mines of Laureium, and TO καινὸν χρυσίον, the gold coins issued after that event, are bracketed together as two good coinages, the equivalent of the καλοὶ κἀγαθοὶ with whom alone the poet is comparing them.
Both are equally pure, and both are contrasted with the worthless bronze of Callias.
It is impossible that the τοίτοισιν of the following line can pass over the proxi- mate καινὸν χρυσίον and apply exclu- sively to the remoter ἀρχαι̑ον νόμισμα.
The plural indeed may be defended on the same grounds as the αὐτὰ, infra 1466, but it more naturally includes both the old and the new ;
and any- how the pronoun οὗτος cannot thus be employed for ἐκείνος.
Moreover χρυσίον is used in line 720 without the slightest reference to χαλκίοις and χολκίοις in line 725 without the slightest reference to χρυσί
ον.
This bronze coinage seems to have been called in so soon as the silver mines were again available, for Kuster on Eccl.
815 is doubtless right in supposing this to be the coinage there mentioned.
My best thanks are due to Mr. G. F. Hill of the British Museum, to whom I submitted my note, not only for explaining to me how the coins in that institution bear upon the subject, but also for pointing out that the view which I had adopted merely -from a consideration of the language of Aristophanes, had already found favour with numismatists.
It seems to have been first suggested by Bergk (Philol. xxxii, s. 131), then to have been adopted by S. P. Six (Head's Preface, ubi supra), and finally to have been advocated by Köhler in the Zeitschrift für Numismat.
for the year 1898.
Mr. Head, as we have seen, affirms that no debased gold Athenian coins have come down to us, and Mr. Hill tells me that there are not, to his knowledge, any bronze Athenian coins extant which show traces of gold either as plating, or as alloy.722.
καλλίσταις ἁπάντων κ.τ.λ.]
This was no idle vaunt.
The exchange was everywhere in favour of Athens.

Athens did not, like other States, alloy the silver with lead or copper;
on which account this money was particularly valued, and everywhere exchanged with profit.

Polybius, xxii. 15. 26."—Boeckh, Public Economy of Athens, i. 4. The eulogy αὐ κεκιβδηλευ- μέναις is used in contrast neither to the καινὰν χρυσίον nor to the πανηροι̑ς χαλ- κίαις, but to the coinages of other States;

The first words of the gloss are, of course, clue to the erroneous view mentioned in the note on 718-737 above.726.
χθές τε καὶ πρώην]
Yesterday or the day before, a common expression, like the νυ̑ν γε κἀχθὲς of Antigone, 456.
Bergler refers to Demosthenes, De Corona, 130, where the orator says of his opponent, ὀψὲ γάρ πατε—ἀψὲ λέγω ;
χθὲς μὲν αὖν καὶ πρώην ἅμ'Ἀθηναι̑ος Kai ῥήτωρ γέγονε, and Against Leochares, 42, where again the speaker calls a newly- enrolled citizen τὰν πρώην καὶ χθὲς ἐγ- γραΦέντα.
I will only add one other example.
"The love of dancing," says Lycinus in Lucian's De Saltatione, 7, "is no new thing αὐδὲ χθὲς Kai πρώην ἀρξάμεναν, it began with the beginning of the world.
"
Yea for these, our sterling pieces, all of pure Athenian mould, All of perfect die and metal, all the fairest of the fair, All of workmanship unequalled, proved and valued everywhere Both amongst our own Hellenes and Barbarians far away, These we use not:
but the worthless pinchbeck coins of yesterday, Vilest die and basest metal, now we always use instead.
Even so, our sterling townsmen, nobly born and nobly bred, Men of worth and rank and mettle, men of honourable fame, Trained in every liberal science, choral dance and manly game, These we treat with scorn and insult, but the strangers newliest come, Worthless sons of worthless fathers, pinchbeck townsmen, yellowy scum, Whom in earlier days the city hardly would have stooped to use Even for her scapegoat victims, these for every task we choose.730. πρ
ουσελου̑μεν] Προπηλακίζαμεν.— Scholiast.
πραυσελει̑ν, which is found only here and in Aesch.
Prom. 447 (ὁρω̑ν ἐμαυτὰν ὧδε προυσελούμενον) is described by Buttmann (Lexilogus, s.v.) as " one of the most enigmatical words in the Greek language."
That the υ represents the digamma is generally agreed ;
but Buttmann's own suggestion, that the word is compounded of προ- and an unknown verb meaning "to trample under foot," has not met with -universal acceptance.
Happily there, is no doubt as to its meaning :
to treat with contumely and insult.
As to πυρ- ρίαις, the Scholiast observes that slaves with yellow hair were so called, just as one with auburn hair was called Xanthias
The term ξένοις is meant to include all -those who, like Cleophon and Archedemus, were supposed to have foreign blood in their veins.. μὴ βούλεσθε, says Andocides in the perora- tion of his speech
In the matter of the Mysteries, μὴ βούλεσθε Ɵετταλαὺς καὶ733, Φαρμακοι̑σιν]
It seems certain that at the festival of the Thargelia at Athens two human beings were slain, their bodies burned, and the ashes cast into the sea.
This rite was considered a purification of the city, and the victims were therefore called Φαρμακοὶ or καθάρματα.
As they were doubtless the vilest of the people, if not actually condemned criminals, the names Φαρ- μακὸς (Knights 1405) and κάθαρμα (Plutus 454) became ordinary terms of abuse.
Bergler quotes two frag- ments of Eupolis, containing a very similar complaint to that in the text.
The first is from-Stobaeus, Flor. xliii.
9—The second is from Athenaens, x. 25—734. ὠ̑νόητοι]
It was ὠ̑ σοφώτατοι in the Epirrhema, when the poet was not quite sure of his footing, but now that he is dealing with generalities, he re- covers his wonted confidence, and the σοφώτατοι become ἀνόητοι.736.

In the words ἐξ ἀξίου γου̑ν του̑ ξύλου, he is referring, the Seholiast tells us, to a proverb, ἀπὸ καλου̑ ξύλου κἂν ὰπάγξασθαι, the precise bearing of whieh is not absolutely certain.
Probably it means, “ You had better have a good tree (or beam) than a bad one, even if your' only object is to hang yourself from it” ;
and so it is better to have good instruments than bad, for whatever purpose and with whatever result you use them.
It is better then, the Chorus say, to fail although you are employing your best citizens, than to fail because you are employing your worst.

This is not a mere repetition of the κἄν τι σφαλη̑τ’ of the preceding line.
The allusion to the "wood whereon to hang yourself" has struck a more serious chord, and these words are a euphemism for even if ye perish.
See the note on Wasps 385.738.
νὴ TOP Δία]
During the delivery of the Parabasis, Dionysus and Xan- thias, we must suppose, have been.
brought before Pluto and Persephone, and the imposture of Xanthias has, of course, been immediately detected.
Aeacus and Xanthias now return to the stage in familiar converse;
the earliest extant specimen of a dialogue between two slaves, not merely as agents of their masters, or as jest- makers for the audience, but as mem- bers of a distinct class, speaking of their own feelings, of their own likes and dislikes..
Such dialogues were common enough in later Greek comedy, as we know from the Roman imitations, and kept very much to the spirit in which Aristophanes started them.
The Latin obsecro is the exact counterpart of the Greek ἱκετεύω of line 745, and the concluding lines of the conversa- tion, 812, 813, might well have come from some comedy imitated by Plautus or Terence.743.
του̑το] TO λοιδορεȋν τὸν δεσπότην ἀπόντα.
—Scholiast.
In the previous scene between Xanthias and Aeacus, Xanthias had been passing himself off as the master, and nothing servile (δουλικὸν) had fallen from his lips ;
but no sooner does he resume the character of a slave than he at once (εὐθὐς) utters the genuine sentiments of a slave, and Aeacus hails him as a brother.745. μὀλλ’ ἐποπτεύειν]
Μἀλλὰ is for μὴ ἀλλὰ, as supra 103, 611 ;
infra 751 ;
Ach. 458;
Thesm. 288.
Not only so, but ... ἐν οἵ τρόπω̩ λέγομεν ovx οȋον ἥδομαι, dXX'ὑπερήδομαι, says the Scholiast.
An ἐπόπτης was a μύστης of the highestgrade, who was initiated into, and allowed to participate in, the most secret and sacred mysteries at Eleusis.
Cf. infra 1126. ἐποπτεύειν therefore meant to enjoy the highest felicity permitted to man.750.
‛Ομόγνιε Zευ̑] " Fratrum est invo- care Jovem ὁμόγνιον,” observes Bergler, referring to the Scholiast on Eurip.
Hec. 345, who says, οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ‛Ομόγνιον Δία προέτεινον.
But this is too narrow a limitation.
Zeus was invoked under that name, not only between brothers, but between any members of the same family or kindred.
‛Ομόγνιοι θεοί οǐς ot συγγενȋς κοινω̑ς ὀργιόξουσιν.—Photius.
So Timaeus, where Ruhnken's note collects the passages bearing on the subject.
Thus in Eurip.
Androm. 921, Hermione says to her cousin Orestes, And in Soph.
Oed. Col. 1332, Polyneices implores his father to help him πρὸς θεω̑ν ‛Ομογνίων.
So Plato, Laws, ix.

ὁμομαστιγίας]
He- begins as if he were about to repeat ὁμόγνιος, God of relatives, but he unexpectedly changes it to ὁμομαστιγίας, God of rascals, as even more appropriate to Aeacus and him- self.
‛Ομομαστιγίας does not mean " fellow-knave," as the Oxford lexico- graphers translate it, any more than ὁμόγνιος means " of the same family as ourselves.”
It is merely a parody on ὁμόγνιος, and means patron of the rogues' fraternity." ἀντὶ του̑ εἰπεȋν
ὁμό- ὁ̔μομαστιγίας, says the Scholiast.757.
τίς οὑ̑τος θόρυβοs]
Observe how abruptly Aristophanes turns from the regular progress of his plot to introduce the poetical contest, which is quite irrelevant to it.
With equal abrupt- ness, in 1415 infra, he drops the artistic question, and returns to the original purpose of the play.
In my opinion, the idea of this contest had been long maturing in the poet's mind, and had probably been completely elaborated, before the death of Euripides inspired him with the general plot of the comedy of the Frogs.
On this point, some remarks will be found in the Introduction.
The Scholiast thinks that Xanthias was about to question Aeacus περί τινος πράγματος δουλικου̑, but being interrupted by the com- motion within, asks instead what is the meaning of all this hubbub.
And this view is adopted by Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Green, but seems to me ex- ceedingly doubtful.762. ἀπὸ τω̑ν τεχνω̑ν]
He is adopting the language of the supposed law, which spoke of craftsmen coming to Hades from (a7ro) the crafts above.
He who, coming from the crafts above, is the most excellent of all in the same craft, is to receive honours such as those which are awarded at Athens for the highest and most honourable services.
The expression ἄριστον τω̑ν συντέχνων is, of course, an instance of the use, common in all languages, of the superlative for the comparative, like Milton's Adam, the goodliest man of men since born His sons;
the fairest of her daughters, Eve.τὰ. καθ’ ‟Αιδου.—Scholiast.
On the Attic σίτησις ἐν Πρυτανείω̩, see the note on Peace 1084.
The establishment of the Athenian Prytaneum as the one state hall for the whole of Attica was part, of the centralizing policy of Theseus (Thuc. ii. 15).
There, every day, a company of distinguished guests was entertained at the public expense :
am- bassadors from foreign states, Athenian envoys returning from foreign missions (Acharnians 125;
Demosthenes de F. L. 35, 36, 259;
Aeschines, Id. 49), public officials, popular leaders (Knights 281, 1404), and others who had done, or were conceived to have done, the state some service.
And others were there merely as the descendants of someWith all the crafts, the good and noble crafts, That the chief master of his art in each Shall have his dinner in the assembly hall, And sit by Pluto's side, XAN.

XAN.

AEAC.

XAN.

AEAC.
But when Euripides came down, he kept Flourishing off before the highwaymen, Thieves, burglars, parricides-these form our mob In Hades-till with listening to his twists And turns, and pleas and-counterpleas, they went Mad on the man, and hailed him first and wisest:
Elate with this, he claimed the tragic chairillustrious ancestor.
Thus, in later days, the eldest descendant for the time being of the orator Lycurgus was entitled for all time to a seat at the public table :
a decree of the people (the third of the decrees appended to the Lives of the Ten Orators) having granted a σίτησιν ἐν Πρυτανείω̜ τω̑ν ἐγγό- ἅπαντα τνό χρόνον.
Some of the dis- tinguished guests were invited merely for one day, or for some short period ;
others retained their privilege for their whole lives.
In any case, the σίτησις ἐν Πρυτανείω̜ was esteemed one of the greatest of honours;
and innumerable are the references made to it in Athenian literature.
To the instances given in the note to the Peace, I will add but one other.
In Lucian's Piscator, 46 ’Αλήθεια proposes that if, amongst the shoals of impostors, they can catch one genuine philosopher, he shall be crowned with a crown of olive, and invited to the entertainment in the Prytaneum.771.
ἐπεδείκνυτο]
This is the ordinary word for the displays given by rhetori- cians, philosophers, poets, professors, dancers (Lucian, De Salt. 63), and the like, of their proficiency in their re- spective arts.
It is of common occur- rence in the writings of Plato and others.
For a lively description of these ἐπιδείξεις, see Sewell's Dialogues of Plato, chaps. 20 and 21.774. ἐν "Αιδου πλη̑θος]
Which of course is far from being the case in Athens, he implies, ironically.
See infra 783, 808.—Scholiast.783.ἕσπερ ἐθάδε]
As he utters these- words, he looks at the audience.
δεί- κνυσιν, says the Scholiast, ὡς πρὸς τὸ790.
κἀκεȋνος]
The ἐκεȋνος of this speech is Sophocles, whose attitude towards Aeschylus in the world below is being contrasted with that of Euri- pides, of whom they have hitherto been talking.
The strange notion that ἐκεȋνος must here mean Aeschylus has arisen from not observing that the speaker is but carrying on the pronoun appro- priated to Sophocles at the commence- ment of the speech :
" He, for his part, saluted Aeschylus, and he, for his part, resigned all claim to the chair."
To suppose that Aeschylus recognized Sophocles as his superior is contrary to the mind of Aristophanes and to the whole tone and tenor of the play (cf. infra 1519), while it is impossible to regard seriously the grotesque sug- gestion that Aeschylus gave him a little bit of his chair, so that the two poets sat at dinner in one chair.
Neither ὑποχωρεȋν nor even παραχωρεȋν (supra 767) necessarily implies a pre- vious occupation of the thing conceded.

When he came down, he kissed With reverence Aeschylus, and clasped his hand, And yielded willingly the chair to him.
But now he's going, says Cleidemides, To sit third-man:
and then if Aeschylus win, He'll stay content:
if not, for his art's sake, He'll fight to the death against Euripides.

Κλειδημίδης]
Sophocles, as we know, lived to a good old age, and probably in his later years the easy and indolent old man had little com- munication with the busy outer world :
so that what the Athenians heard of their great poet came mostly through the medium of Cleidemides, whom some call his son, but others, with more probability (since the name does not occur in the list of his sons given by Suidas), the chief actor in his plays.
Aristophanes seizes hold of the poet's habit of using Cleidemides as his inter- preter, and transfers it to the world below.

Πρὸς τὸν (vyov προσάξουσι καὶ στήσουσιν.—Scholiast.
Bring to the scales and weigh.
As to the derivation of the word, the Scholi- asts tell a strange story, improbable in itself, but corroborated, with slight variation, by all the old grammarians, Harpocration, Pollux, Hesychius, Pho- tius, Suidas.
When a father brought his son to be enrolled as a member of a phratry, he brought also a lamb for a sacrifice.
The lamb was bound to be of a certain size and weight, and such parts of it as were not consumed for the sacrifice were given as a feast for the members of the phratry.
These gentlemen were therefore very deter- mined that it should not fall short of the weight required, and while it was being weighed, kept shouting, μεȋον, μεȋον, Too little !
too little !
Hence the lamb came to be called μεȋον, the bringer ὁ μειαγωγὸς, and the bringing μειαγωγεȋν.
How anxious the bringer was that the scale should drop to the proper weight is shown by some lines which Harpocration, s.v., cites from the famous Demi of Eupolis-
The του̑δε νίκη is supposed to be the victory of Miltiades on the field of Marathon.800.
καὶ πλαίσια]
Πλαίσια, otherwise πλινθία, are the oblong wooden frames into which the clay is pressed, to assume the shape of bricks :
τὰ τω̑νAnd then, I hear, will wonderful things be done, The art poetic will be weighed in scales.
XAN.

And who's to be the judge ?
AEAC.
There came the rub.
Skilled men were hard to find:
for with the Athenians Aeschylus, somehow, did not hit it off,that πλαίοιον was the Attic, πλινθίον the Hellenic name.
Πλαίσια τὰ διὰ ξύλων τετράγωνα πήγματα,—Hesychius.
These πήγματα were of course σύμπηκτα, and therefore both the Scholiast and Suidas say, To δὲ ξύμπηκτα πρὸς οὐδὲν, ἀλλ' οἷον περιττὰ nat σοφά.
The MSS.

but it is plain that all the accusatives depend on ἐξοίσουσι, and Kock's emendation, ΞΑ.
πλινθεύσουσι yap ;
is universally accepted.
804.
ταυρηδόν]
The word denotes, not the quality, but the manner of the glance.
It means a glance shot upward from underneath bended brows.
The name is derived from the circumstance that a bull about to charge lowers its head, and cannot therefore look straight at its adversary without glancing up- ward from beneath its overhanging brows.
With a bull the glance would, from the nature of the case, be savage ;
but with a man it may be hostile, friendly, humorous, or of any other quality.
It was a favourite trick of Socrates;
and in the closing scene of the Phaedo, when the attendant brings in the cup of hemlock, Plato mentions it with the loving tenderness with which he ever recalls his master's peculiarities.
"He took the cup," he says, " very cheerfully ;
his hand did not shake nor his colour change, ἀλλ', ὥοπερ εἰώθει, ταυρηδὸν ὑποβλέψας πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπ
ον, he asked if he might pour out some drops as a libation to the gods," The two participles, ἐγκύψας κάτω here and ὑποβλέψας in the Phaedo, embrace the entire idea conveyed by the adverb ταυρηδόν.
The glance of Aeschylus was hostile ;
that of Socrates probably shrewd and humorous;
but neither quality is implied by the adverb.
In Lucian's Philopatris 2, a man in anxious thought is said ταυρηδὸν ἐπιβλέπειν.
He had just before been described as τὰς ὀφρῦς κάτω
συννενευκώς.807.
συνέβαινε]
He is of course allud- in,, not to any want of appreciationshown by the Athenians to the trage- dies of Aeschylus, for no tragic poet was more successful on the Athenian- stage than he:
but to the misunderstand- ing, whatever it was, which resulted in his leaving Athens, and taking up his abode in Sicily.
The cause of this mis- understanding is uncertain:
but most authorities attribute it to the unplea- sant position in which Aeschylus found himself placed by the charge that in some of his dramas he had too plainly trenched upon the secrets of the Eleu- sinian mysteries.
808.
τοιχωρύχους]
And these, as we have seen, supra 773, would be thorough going partisans of the poet, whose casuistical reasoning could persuade his hearers TO μὲν αἰσχρὸν ἅπαν καλὸν ἡγεῖσθαι, τὸκαλὸν δ' αἰσχρόν.
Scholiast.
With the Athenians Aeschy- lus was not on good terms, and nobody else was qualified to judge.
This little compliment to the audience is, as Mr. Mitchell truly says, as just as it is delicate.
It balances the satire of the preceding line.
The expression λῆρον τἄλλ' is, as the same learned commentator observes, repeated from Lysistrata 860.
There the heroine is endeavouring to kindle the love of Cinesias towards his wife by exaggerating her devotion to him:
"When our talk is of men," Lysistrata says, " she always vows that all other men are mere trash and non- sense by the side of her Cinesias."
ὄτι λῆρός ἐστι τἄλλα πρὸς Κινησίαν.
The line of Antiphanes, ἄρ' ἔστι λῆρος πάντα πρὸς TO χρυσὶον (Stobaeus, Florileg. xci. 14) was probably in the mind of St. Chry- sostom when he wrote πάντα λῆρ
ος τος πολλοῖς καὶ μῦθοι διὰ τὰ χρήματα Hom. xvi in 1 Cor. (141 C).811. τῆς τέχνης ἔμπειρ
ος ἦν]
For not only was Dionysus the special patron of the drama, at whose festivals and in whose honour all plays were ex- hibited :
he was also, as Mr. Haigh observes, "the one spectator who had been present at every dramatic per- formance from first to last.
On the evening before the festival his statue was taken out of his temple by the Ephebi, and conveyed by torchlight to the theatre.
It was there placed in the orchestra, in full view of the stage, soXAN.
Too many burglars, I expect, he thought.

CHOR.

Corp. Inscript. Att. ii. 470, 471." -Attic Theatre, ii. 6.814. ἦ 7TOV, κ.τ.λ.]
Xanthias and Aeacus leave the stage and are seen no more.
Whilst the preparations for the next great scene are proceeding within, the Chorus deliver four symmetrical stanzas descriptive of the impending conflict.
Each stanza consists of four lines, the first two being Homeric hexameters, purely dactylic, except that in the first line the first foot, and in the.
second line the fourth foot, is invariably a spondee.
The third line merely omits the spondee.
The fourth is a trochaic dimeter catalectic.
In the first stanza the two combatants are likened to two wild boars, preparing for the fray.
Aeschylus is styled ἐριβρεμέτης, an epi- thet which the commentators consider to be boiTowed from Zeus, but which, as well as ἐρίβρομος, is applied by Pindar to the lion (01. x. 21, Isthm. iii. 64), and is here probably given to the wild boar in respect of the " short savage grunt of anger" with which it turns upon its pursuers.
In Bacchylides v. 116 the Calydonian boar is called σῦς ἐριβρύχας, with which compare βρυχώ- μενος in the third stanza. " Assuredly," say the Chorus, " will he of the thunder- voice be full of terrible wrath, when he sees with a sidelong glance his opponent whetting his sharp-voiced tusk."
ὀξύ- λαλον is contrasted with ἐριβρεμέτης.
The compound πορίδῃ refers to the side- long glance and attack of the charging boar, which Homer (Iliad, xii. 148), in describing the sally of the two La- pithae, represents by the epithet δοχμώ.
Perhaps I may be allowed to quote the passage from Mr. Way's noble version :
—
Like unto fierce wild boars that in some lone mountain glen Unquailing abide the oncoming tumult of hunter and hound :
Forth spring they with sidelong rush, and the saplings crash all round, Snapped short at the roots, and rings out sharp through the din of the strife
The clash of the tusks, till the darts smite out each monster's life;
Even so on the breasts of the champions rang the brass flame-bright
As the darts rained down, for in dauntless-desperate wise did they fight, &c.815.
The same metaphor is employed in Lys. 1256.818.
ἔσταιδ' K.T.X.]
In the second stanza the simile of the wild boar is dropped, though it reappears in the third.
Dobree therefore wished to trans- pose the second and third stanzas :
but it is more probable that the stanzas were divided between two semichoruses, one of whom sang the first and the third, and the other the second and the fourth.
"Then will be plume- dancing contests of lofty-crested words " on the part of Aeschylus, and whirl- ing of splinters and chiselling of work " on the part of Euripides, " as the man in repelling the high-stepping phrases of the creative-minded hero":
φὼς is good enough for Euripides, the nobler ἀνὴρ is reserved for Aeschylus.819. σκινδαλάμων]
Split straws, τὰ τῶν καλάμων ἀποξύσματα, used metaphorically here, as n Clouds 130, of the hairsplit- ting subtleties of casuistical argument.
It is employed in exactly the same sense in Sozomen's Eccl.
Hist. i. 18. 2, and as these subtleties are there attri- buted ἀνδρὶ τεχνίτῃ λάγων, the historian would seem to have been familiar with the language of Aristophanes.
See also Lucian's " Hesiod," 5, and the Scholiast there.
The Scholiast here explains παραξόνια by κινδυνδη καὶ παράβολα, 'repi τὸν τροχὸν ἑλκόμενα.
It seems rather to mean minute particles thrown off as the wheel revolves.
The quibbles of Euripides are not even split straws;
they are merely the particles shaken off them.
But perhaps we should adopt Herwerden's conjecture παραξόανα, scrap- ings, from ξέω.
σμιλεύειν is to polish or smooth with a plane or chisel.
In the epigram on Tragedy by Dioscorides, cited on 1004 infra, Aeschylus is described as ὁ μὴ σμιλευτὰ χαράξας Γράμματα.
The metaphor was a common one in later writers.
See Jacobs's notes on this epigram in the Anthology.
When he sees his opponent beside him, the tonguester, the artifice-skilled, Stand, whetting his tusks for the fight!
0 surely, his eyes rolling-fell Will with terrible madness be fraught!
O then will be charging of plume-waving words with their wild-floating mane, And then will be whirling of splinters, and phrases smoothed down with the plane, When the man would the grand-stepping maxims, the language gigantic, repel Of the hero-creator of thought.
There will his shaggy-born crest upbristle for anger and woe, Horribly frowning and growling, his fury will launch at the foe Huge-clamped masses of words, with exertion Titanic up-tearing Great ship-timber planks for the fray.τοῦ Αἰσχύλου.—Scholiast.
We shall find, as we go, through the ensuing contest, that the term ῥήματα is specially appro- priated to the large utterances" of Aeschylus.
The epithet φρενοτέκτων im- plies that the earlier poet drew from the treasures of his own mind, in con- trast to Euripides, who derived his know- ledge from books ;
cf. infra 943.
And so Dr. Merry explains it.
A similar idea is conveyed by αὐτοκόμου two lines below.
822.
φρίξας κ.τ.λ.]
The third stanza reverts to the wild boar, and like the first, is descriptive of the action of Aeschylus.
He "uprearing the shaggy- maned bristles of his nature-clothed neck, knitting together his dreadful brows, with a savage roar will hurl forth strong-clamped masses of words (tear- ing them out, plankwise) with Titanic effort of lung."
On the first line the Scholiast remarks ώσεὶ εἶπεν ὀργισθεὶς ὥσπερ σῦς, and Bergler refers to the description of the boar about to rush on Odysseus φρίξας εὔλοφιήν, κ.τ.λ., Od. xix. 446.823. ἐπισκύνιὸν]
To ἐπάνω τῶν ὀφθαλ- μῶν μέρος, ἤτοι δέρμα τὸ συνοφρύωμα τοῦ μετώπου.—Scholiast.
And he refers to Homer's description of an angry lion πᾶν δέ τ'ἐπισκύνιονκάτω ἓλκεται ὅσσε καλύπτων (II. xvii. 136), which again I should like to give from Mr. Way's version- But Aias covered Menoitius' son with his broad shield's rim, And there he stood, as standeth a lion defending his young, On whom, as he leadeth his whelps through the forest, there cometh a throng I Of huntsman-folk ;
but within him the storm of his might doth rise, And the down-drawn skin of his brows overgloometh the fire of his eyes.
Xat σανίδες τῶν πλοίων.

Mr. Mitchell observes that γόμφος and its compounds seem to have been favourite826. ἔνθεν 8']
The fiual stanza de- scribes the modus operandi whereby Euripides will repel the high-stepping phrases of Aeschylus. "
Thereupon the glib tongue, the smooth-polished tester of words, uncoiling itself, shaking en- vious bits, will by dissecting those masses of words subtilize to nothing that large labour of the lungs."
στοματ- ουργὸς is merely "loquacious, talkative," like στόμαργος, or γλώσσαργος, which the Etym.

explains by ταχύγλωσσος. The Scholiast explains λίσπη by ἡ ἐκτε- τριμμένη καὶ λεία.
And so the other Grammarians.
See Ruhnken on Ti- maeus, s. v., and cf. Knights 1368.
827. φθονεροὺς κινοῦσα χαλινούς]
Shak- ing envious bits.
It is not clear what this means.
The older commentators give no explanation.
Mitchell inter- prets it of the begrudging jaws of Euripides, unused to utter such long words," but this can hardly be right.
Paley translates it " moving along with all the speed of malice " ;
Mr. Green, "shaking the loose reins of malice";
Dr. Merry, "shaking loose the reins of malice";
Dr. Blaydes, "champing the bit in envy."
Possibly it may be equivalent to our common expression- " giving a free rein to his envy " ;
but the attack of Aeschylus has been com- pared to a charge of cavalry, and I am inclined to think that the curbs are intended to restrain the onset of the ῥήμαθ' ἱπποβάμονα.
The ῥήμαθ' ἱπποβά- μονα are to be curbed ;
the ῥήματαγομ- φοπαγῆ are to be reduced to nothing by subtle refinement and sophistry.
And possibly this was the view of the Scholiast, who says πρὸς τὸἱπποβά-But here will the tongue be at work, uncoiling, word-testing, refining Sophist-creator of phrases, dissecting, detracting, maligning, Shaking the envious bits, and with subtle analysis paring The lung's large labour away.

πλευμόνων πολὺν πόνον]
Mitchell translates the lungs' large labour, observing that the reference is to " the huge words of Aeschylus, which it cost the lungs so much labour to produce."
And to illustrate the alliteration he cites Aesch.
Persae 747, πολὺς πλούτου πόνος.
Duker refers to Persius, Sat. i. 14, "Grande aliquid, quod pulmo animae praelargus anhelet."
See also the frag- ment cited from the Myrmidons in the note on 932 infra.830.
OVK ἃν μεθείμην]
Apparently we have here a complete change of scene.
We are introduced into the Hall of Pluto, with Pluto himself sitting on his throne, and Dionysus, Aeschylus and Euripides in the foreground.
The parts of Dionysus, Aeschylus and Euri- pides are taken by the three state-sup- plied or (so to say) professional actors.
Pluto, represented by a Choregic actor, is a mere mute for the next 584 lines (indeed until the poetic contest is over), and then speaks three lines only.
Then he again relapses into silence whilst the political catechism is proceeding, after which he intervenes with three short remarks, each less than a line.
And see the note on 1479 infra.
As the scene opens, the pert and confident voice of Euripides is heard in eager expostulation with Dionysus.836.
διέσκεμμαι πάλαι]
These words subsequently became, if they were not already, a stock phrase of sophistical rhetoricians. "
They begin, says Philo- stratus, all their harangues with 'I know,' 'I am sure,' 'I have examined the question.' προοἱμια yovv ποιεῖται τῶν λάγωντὸοlda, καὶ τὸγινώσκω, καὶ πάλαι διέσκεκμμαι.
De Vit. Sophist. Prooem., p. 480."—Sewell, Dialogues of Plato, chap. xxii.
Here we have the οἶδα and the πάλαι διέσκεμμαι in combination.
837.
ἀγριοποιόν] 'Αγριοποιὸς means the introducer of wild and savage person- ages in his dramas :
as the terms πτω- χοποιὸς and χωλοπιὸς, applied to Euri- pides just below, refer to his habit of introducing paupers and cripples on the stage.
ἀπεριλάλητ
ον, two lines below, is commonly translated " not to be out- talked," but I rather agree with Mr. Green that it signifies unskilled in periphrasis," or in other words, not beating about the bush, but speaking out in blunt straightforward language.
περιλαλει̃ν is equivalent to περιττολογει̃ν, φλυαρει̃ν (Suidas) and περιλέγειν to τὰ περισσὰ φρζειν (Hesychius).
Hence in Clouds 318 Socrates describes the sophis- tical goddesses as bestowing on their votaries περίλειν, which the Scholiast there explains by περιττολογίαν, περί- φρασιν (so Suidas), εὐπορίαν καὶ περιττό- τητα λόγων.
The expression ἀχάλινον στόμα is found in Euripides, -Bacchae 385, a passage frequently cited by old writers.
See Elmsley ad loco 840.

Hah, sayest thou so, child of the Ocean Queen ?
which Musgrave with great probability con- jectures to come from the Telephus, and to have been addressed by that person- age to Achilles.
Achilles was the son of Thetis, τη̃ς θαλασαίας θεου̃, but Euripides of Cleito, τη̃ς λαχανοπωλητρίας, whose avocation was a never-failing subject for comic banter.

πρὰς ὀργήν]
Fritzsche is obvi- ously mistaken in translating this line, noli iracundia tua iram Euripidis exci- tare:
not only because πρὸς ὰργὴν is regularly used in an adverbial sense, with passion, passionately (cf. infra 856, 9981;
Pausanias, iii.
9. 5;
Lucian's Jupiter Confutatus, 5, where the cynic says to Zeus, A τραέως μηδὲ πρὸς ὀργὴν ἀκουσης μου τἀληθη̃ μετὰ παρρησίας λέγοντος, and Id. Symposium 4), but also because it would be supremely ridiculous to exhort Aeschylus not to provoke Euripides to wrath.
In the Comedies of Aristophanes, if not in reality, Euripides had no pas- sions to be provoked ;
he is always the philosopher-poet of imperturbable serenity, whose equanimity and self- complacency nothing can disturb, and whose argumentative loquacity nothing can repress.
The words which follow σπλάγχνα θερμήνῃς ΚΟΤΩt are a parody of Eur.
Cyclops 423 σπλάγχν' έθέρματνον ΠΟΤΩι heated his soul with wine.
The expression σπλάγχνα θερμαίνειν ποτῳ may very well have caught the fancy of young Athenian tipplers, and passed into the current phraseology of the day :
so that this Aristophanic adaptation of it would be universally recognized and appreciated.849. μανῳδίας]
A μανῳδία, as the name implies, and the specimen given below (1331-1363) sufficiently illustrates, was what Tennyson called "A Lyrical Mono- logue " ;
and the ill repute of the Cretan ladies in Hellenic legend had linked to the epithet Κρητικὰς the idea of " love- sick," "incestuous.''
Euripides had written a play called Κρη̃σσατ, or The Cretan Women, and another called Κρη̃τες or The Cretan Men.
Each seems to have contained a lovesick monody :
the former depicting the incestuous passion of Aerope, the latter, the un- natural passion of Pasiphae.
Pasiphae was the mother of Phaedra, who carried on the Cretan taint, though her inces- tuous longings are displayed (in the Hippolytus) not in a monody but in a Lyrical Dialogue.
See the note on 1356 infra.
It was from an entire mis- apprehension of the nature of a Cretan monody that Fritzsche endeavoured to connect it with the Κρητικὰ ύπορχήματαa.
The two things have nothing whatever in common.850.
γάμους ἀνασίαυς]
Here he is refer- ring, as the Scholiast suggests, to such marriages as those of Macareus and Canace in the Aeolus.
See the note on 863 infra.851.
ὦ παλυτίμητ' Αίσχύλε]
The epi- thets applied to Aeschylus and Euri- pides in this and the following line, do not bode well for the impartiality of the judge.
πολυτίμητ
ος is found sixteen times in these comedies, and this is the only passage in which it is applied to a mere man.
Elsewhere it is uniformly employed of a divine or superhuman being.
DIO.
Forbear, forbear, most honoured Aeschylus ;
And you, my poor Euripides, begone
If you are wise, out of this pitiless hail, Lest with some heady word he crack your scull And batter out your brain—less Telephus.

The talk, the lays, the sinews of a play:
λέγεται, apparently (see Kuster's note there) quoting from Theophylact's Com- mentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews viii.
Here there is a play on the ety- mology, as if it meant head-crushing.855.
τὸν Τήλεφον]
For TOP ἐγκέφαλον, to which the sentence has been leading up, he unexpectedly substitutes τὸν Τήλεφον, words of a somewhat analogous sound.
This is merely for the purpose of raising another laugh at that unlucky play, the very mention of which was always a source of unbounded amuse- ment to Aristophanes.
The story of the play was as follows.
Telephus has been wounded by the spear of Achilles;
and is informed by an oracle that nothing will relieve the intolerable anguish of the wound save that which caused it.
Thereupon he disguises him- self as a beggar and visits the Argive leaders.
His attire is described with great minuteness in the Acharnians, where it is donned by Dicaeopolis, who wears it through an important scene, and, with the hero's dress puts on the hero's unlimited power of speech.
Achilles is playing at dice (infra 1400), but Telephus gains a hearing by snatching out of his cradle, and threatening to slay, the infant Orestes ;
somewhat after the fashion of Dicaeopolis in the Acharnians, and Mnesilochus in the Thesmophoriazusae.
Ultimately he is cured by the spear of Achilles, and undertakes, in return, to guide the Argive host on its journey to Troyland.858.
ὦσπερ ἀρτοπώλιδας]
The vitupera- tive powers of Athenian baking-girls are illustrated in the Wasps.
See the note on Wasps 1388.862.
τἂπη κ.τ.λ.]
By τἂπη we are tounderstand the ordinary dialogue, by τὰ μέλη the choral songs.
The word μέλη has, of course, another significa- tion, viz. limbs ;
and Aristophanes seems to be playing on this double meaning of the word when he adds, τὰ νευ̃ρα τη̃ς τραγῳδίας, the sinews, that is, the general anatomy, of the Tragedy.
Had the speech ended with this line, we should have supposed that these accusatives belonged as well to Safety as to δάκνε- σθαι;
to carp at τἂπη K.T.X. of the plays of Aeschylus, and to be carped at in respect of τἂπη K.T.X. of my own plays ;
but the two following lines show that Euripides has dropped the idea of δάκνειν altogether, and is referring ex- clusively to his own compositions.
863.
τὸν Πηλέα κ.τ.λ.]
All these four plays are mentioned by Aristophanes elsewhere also.
Of the Telephus, enough has already been said.
Peleus seems to have been another of the poet's ragged heroes, the play dealing with that period of his life when he and Telamon were exiled from Aegina by their father, Aeacus, for killing their half-brother, Phocus.
It is, no doubt, as Musgrave observes, to these two tragedies of Euri- pides that Horace is referring in the familiar lines-
Telephus et Peleus, cum pauper et exul, uterque Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba, Si curat cor spectantis tetigisse querela.
—Ars Poetica 96-8.A line from the Peleus is reproduced in Clouds 1154, βούσομαι τἂρα τὰν ύπέρτονον βοὰν, which, the Scholiast there tells us, was followed by the exclamation, ἰὼ, ἦ τις ἐν δόμοις ;
see Bp. Blom- field at Choeph.
642.
They are probably the words of the exile clamouring for admittance into a house where he hopes for a friendly reception.
The Aeolus was the notorious tragedy which dealt with the incestuous marriage of Maca- reus and Canace, the children of Aeolus.

οὐχὶ συντέθνηκέ μοι]
We are told by Athenaeus (viii. 39) that once, when Aeschylus was unjustly defeated, he merely remarked, with philosophic com- posure, that he dedicated his tragedies to Time, χρόνῳ τὰς τραγῳδίας ἀντιθέναι, well knowing, adds Athenaeus, or the author from whom he borrows the anecdote, that he would in the future obtain his due meed of honour.
What he then anticipated has now come to pass.
Though he himself has passed into the unseen world, his plays are still living in the world above.
The Scholiast refers to the well-known fact that at the date of the Frogs, he was the only deceased author whose trage- dies could be acted on the Athenian stage, a privilege awarded them by a special decree of the Athenian people.
See also the Greek Life of Aeschylus and the Scholiast on Ach. 10, Haigb's Attic Theatre, ii.
7. But of course the language of the text must not be limited to this particular privilege.
In a characteristic fragment which has come down to us from the funeral oration of Gorgias, the orator, after setting forth in evenly-balanced periods the merits of the dead, says, τοιγαροῦν,869.
τουτῳ δὲ συντέθηκεν]
He means that the tragedies of Euripides are as dead as their author, and therefore both poet and poems are together in the realm of Hades.
But though Aris- tophanes rightly foretells the immor- tality of Aeschylus, his satire on Euri- pides was speedily refuted by the event.
There were no real successors to the great Triumvirate of Tragedy :
and the plays of all three were, in the follow- ing century, commonly acted on the Athenian stage.
And ultimately Euri- pides became the one popular tragedian :
in part, no doubt, because, as he says himself, he dealt with αἰκι̃α ITpaypara, οἲς χρώμεθ', οἲςξύνεσμεν.
In the Philoc- tetes of Sophocles, 1443, Heracles says, according to the MSS.—a statement which seems reasonable enough, considering that the speaker himself had' passed into the unseen world, and found that his piety and good works had, to use the scriptural expression, followed him there.
But Dawes, in his note on this passage of Aristophanes, altered the words ἠ γὰρ εὐσέβεια into ού -yap ηὐσέβεια, a change which, I should have thought, would require the following line to commence with a negative instead of with καὶ, but which has been adopted by the best editors of Sophocles.872.
ἆπωςἆνεὓξωμαι]
We have seen very similar preparations for prayer in Wasps 860-2—874. ται̃ς Μούσαις]

Τὰ μὲν ῤήματα πρὸς τὸν Αἰσχύλον, says the Scholiast;
τὰ δὲ παaραπρίσματa πρὸς τὸν Εὐριπίδην, λεπτολόον ὂντα.
The word ῤήματα is appropriated in this play to the language of Aeschylus (supra 824, 828, 854, infra 924, 940, 1004);
just as in the Acharnians and Peace the di- minutive ῤημάτια is applied to the language of Euripides.
παραπριματα are the small unsubstantial chips thrown off in the process of sawing.
886.
Δήμητερ]
Παρόσον 'Ελευσίνιος τὸν δη̃μον ἦν ὀ Αἰσχύλος.—Scholiast.
The name of Demeter would naturally rise to the lips of Aeschylus, who not only was a native of Eleusis, but also had been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries.
The lofty doctrines incul- cated in those mysteries made them- selves felt in all his dramas, and in some so conspicuously that he was, we know, accused of having divulged the holy secrets which it was not lawful for man to utter.887.
εἲναί μ'K.T.X.]
Each prayer (as well as each invocation) is, of course, intended to be characteristic of the speaker, and neither in itself contains anything common or mean.
It is not mere victory that the poets seek.
Aeschylus, indeed, does not ask for victory at all:
he merely prays that in the impending struggle he may bear himself in a manner worthy of Demeter's high and holy mysteries.
Euripides prays that he may win, but only by the employment of true artistic skill.892.
αἰθἡρ, κ.τ.λ.]
Euripides invokes four of his new-fangled deities:
(1) αἰθήρ.
Few lines of Euripides have been more frequently quoted than the following from an unnamed tragedy-And compare supra 100,311, and Thesm.
272. The words ἐμὸν βόσκημα are in- tended to parallel the ἡ θρέψασα τὴν ἐμὴν φρένα of Aeschylus.
(2) γλώττης στρόφιγξ the pivot on which the tongue revolves :
the tongue's volubility.
(3) ξύνεσις, intelligence personified.
It is invoked in precisely the same manner by Aeschines at the close of his oration against Ctesiphon.
(4) μυκτῆρες ὀσφραν- τήριοι, keen-scenting nostrils, an ex- pression equivalent, as Dobree and Mitchell observe, to the ῥῖνα κριτικὴν of Poseidippus in Athenaeus, xiv. 81.894.
ὀρθῶς]
The adverb is emphatic.
It is only by the application of the true rules of poetic criticism that he hopes to gain the victory.895.

In a short ode, the antistrophe to which will be found infra 992, the Chorus express their pleasure at the prospect of the impending duel,Dio. (To Eur.)

The language of Euripides will be highly finished, as though smoothed with a file;
the lan- guage of Aeschylus will consist of rugged uprooted words, like the rugged uprooted trees with which the giants of old assailed the Olympian Gods.
Fritzsche refers to Horace, Odes, iii.
4. 55— Evulsisque truncis Enceladus jaculator audax.(to use the expression of Beatrice in Much A do about Nothing) a " measure full of state and ancientry,' represent- ing, in fact, the majestic dance of tragedy.
See the note on Wasps 1503.
Here, being the call to combat, it is styled ἐμμέλεια δαḯα, a ωarlike measure, a battle melody;
just as in Here.
Fur. 894 the savage roar of the maddened Heracles pursuing his children is de- scribed as a δάϊυν μέλος.
Apparently some glossographer, to illustrate this signification of δάϊος, wrote in the margin three words of an unknown author, ἔπιτε δαϊαν ὁδὸν, and these three words, strange to say, have usurped the place of the single word δαϊαν, which they were intended to explain.
They absolutely destroy both sense and metre :
the line running ἐμμελειαν, ἔπιτε δαϊαν ὀδὸν, whereas the corresponding line in the antistrophe is μή ̕σ' 6 θυμὸς ἁρπάσας, infra 994.
It is wonderful that this unmetrical nonsense should have been allowed to cumber the text so long.904.
ἀλινδήθρας ἐπῶν]
Word exercises, literally, exercise-grounds for words.
An ἀλινδήθρα was a, piece of ground strewn with dust or sand, an arena in fact, whereon wrestlers could roll over and over without injury to themselves.
It was also used as a rolling-place for horses.

The poet is contrasting " the native mightiness ,. of Aeschylus with his opponent's artificial dexterity, the result of the various courses of scholastic training with which his intellect had been cultivated.

Metaphors,

''We want none of your metaphors, Aeschylus;

Ye must both now speak things ἀστεῖα, things of culture and wit, things worthy to be enshrined in a comedy of Aristophanes."
Mr. Haigh, after the remarks cited in the note to 1004 infra respecting the phraseo- logy of Aeschylus, adds
This pomp of language is enlivened throughout by a wealth and brilliance of imagination which has only been equalled, among dramatists, by Shakespeare.
Metaphors, similes, figures, and images come stream- ing from his mind in endless profusion, and without the least appearance of effort.

καὶ μήν]
The serious criticism upon the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides, which commences here, occu- pies about 190 lines.
What remains is merely metrical criticism or purely comic fun.910. φρμνίχῳ]
The tragedies of Phry- nichus were of an essentially lyrical character.
Nothing could surpass, in the estimation of his contemporaries, the sweetness of his melodies, and the infinite variety of his dance-music.
But there could be little dramatic vigour, when the entire business of the play was supported by the Chorus and a single actor :
a state of things which continued until Aeschylus introduced a plurality of actors.912.
'Αχιλλέα κ.τ.λ.]
He is specially referring to two lost tragedies of Aes- chylus, the Phrygians or the Ransom, of Hector and the Niobe.
In the former, Achilles was introduced, wrapped in sullen gloom for the loss of Patroclus, and refusing all food and consolation.
See the Greek Life of Aeschylus.
In the latter, Niobe was shown, dumb with sorrow for her six sons and six daugh- ters, whom Apollo and Artemis had slain.
In her maternal pride, she had exalted herself against Leto-
For she said, “She hath borne but twain, and children many have I”:
And for this by the hand of the twain must all that multitude die.
And see the note on 1392 infra.913.
πρόνχημα τῆς τραγῳςίας]
A mere decoration of the tragedy, like the scenery or other ornaments of the stage.
As he speaks the words οὐδἐ τουτὶ, he makes some-slight sound, possibly as the Scholiast thinks,' by snapping his fingers, εἰκὸς αὐτὸν ἀποκροτου̑ντα τῷ δακ- τύλῳ δεικνύειν τὸ οὐδὲ τουτί.914.
ὁ δὲ χορὸς κ.τ.λ.]
This was liter- ally true of the earlier plays of Aeschylus, before he had emancipated himself from the restrictions of the Phrynichean drama.
We have no speci- men of an Aeschylean tragedy in which one actor only appeared :
but in the Supplices, his earliest extant play, the choral odes occupy 579 lines, and the dialogue, in which again the Chorus takes a leading part, only 479.
It must) however, be remembered (1) that the development of the tragic play con- sisted chiefly of a progressive diminu- tion of the choral portions, and an equivalent enlargement of the actors' duties;
and (2) that Aeschylus was himself the most splendid agent in pro- moting that development.918. ὁδεῖνα]

is borrowed, as the Scholiast observes, from Hippolytus 377, where Phaedra says- Dionysus ponders over his important problem in the night-time, because to use the words of Epicharmus (quoted by Bp. Monk on Hippolytus)-932.
τὸν ξουθὸν ἱππαλεκτρυόνα]
The "tawny cock-horse" has already been trotted out in Peace 1177 and Birds 800.
This hapless animal, ὃνἀεὶ κωμω̨- δου̑σιν (Schol. Peace), was introduced in the Myrmidons of Aeschylus, as the painted figurehead of one of the ships which the Trojans, in the sixteenth Iliad, are represented as setting on fire.
The lines are quoted by the Scholiast on the Peace, and, as corrected by Welcker, run- " The sense," says Mr. Cecil Torr (An- cient Ships, 36 note), “ is obviously that the picture melted off in drops while the vessel was burning."
And he adds.
"This seems to be the earliest record of encaustic on a ship.''
The prefix ἵππος is of course often used to express size only, but the Scholiast is clearly mistaken in thinking it is so used here.
The ἱππαλεκτρυὼν is a composite animal, of the same order as the τραγέλαΦος and the γρυπάετος.934.

Aelian, V. H. x. 9 (to which Brunck refers) and Plutarch, Symp. Probl. iv. 4. 2, De latenter vivendo, 1.936. θεοι̑σιν ἐχθρέ]
Strong words :
but what could be more aggravating to Aeschylus than to find himself repre- hended by Euripides for lowering the dignity of tragedy:
that being the very offence of which Euripides himself was, in the eyes of Aeschylus, pre- eminently guilty.
We shall see by-and- by that in the monody which Aeschylus composes in imitation of Euripides, a cock is the principal figure.
937.
τραγελάΦους]
The τραγέλΦος was another fictitious animal, part stag and part goat.
It is frequently mentioned by ancient writers, Plato, Aristotle, and the later Attic comedians.
Its memory survived because a common drinking- cup was fashioned in the supposed shape of a τραγέλαΦος, and was called by its name.
It is interesting to find from the present passage that fabulous figures of this character were woven into Persian hangings, which were doubtless familiar to the Greeks from the time of the battle of Plataea.
See Hdt. ix. 82.942. ἐπυλλίοις κ.τ.λ.]
We have already heard of the ἐπύλλια of Euripides in Ach.

Peace 532, meaning appar- ently trivial insignificant verses;

Dr. Merry ingeniously suggests a play on έρπυλλίοις wild-thyme.

τευτλίοισι λευκοι̑ς white beet, beta cicla, one variety of which, according to Miller and Martyn, is our common mangold wurzel.
I have translated it “poultices of beet," and that beet was used in this way is plain from the passage quoted by Spanheim from Sotio, I think that Euripides is here referring to an aperient draught;
for Fritzsche's objection to the Scholiast's explanation to that effect, “Falso :
neque enim ullo betae genere uti licet ad alvi purga- tionem," is singularly infelicitous.
Mitchell had already referred to Dioscor. ii. 49, τευ̑τλον δισσόν ἐστιν, ὧντὸ μὲν μέλαν (blood red, as frequently elsewhere) σταλ- τικώτεροντη̑ς κοιλίας, τὸ δὲ λευκὸν εὐκοίλιον :
and to Pliny, H. N. xix. 40, "Betae a colore duo genera Graeci faciunt, nigrum, et candidius quod praeferunt, appellantque Siculum" (whence the botanic name cicla).
“ Mira differentia.
si vera est, candidis solvi alvos.
modice, nigris inhiberi.”
See Id. xx. 27.
To these passages I may add Galen's remarks (De simplici um medicamentorumtempera- mentis ac facultatibus viii. 19) on the properties of beet, τευ̑τλον νιτρώδους943. ἀπὸ βιβλίων]
Euripides possessed one of the largest libraries in the ancient world (Athenaeus, i. 4) :
and out of his stores of book-learning he was able to extract philosophic and casuistical arguments which, the innu- endo is, he placed in the mouths of his various characters, so departing from the simple dignity of ancient tragedy.

speaker, he is of course, here and else- where, merely giving effect to the criticisms of Aristophanes, directed against himself.
944.
ΚηΦισοΦω̑ντα μιγνύς]
With an infusion of Cephisophon.
Cephisophon seems to have been a slave born in the house of Euripides ;
οἰκογενὲς μειράκιον, as he is called in the Greek Life of Euripides published by Rossignol in the Journal des Savans, Avril, 1832.
His cleverness attracted the attention of his master, and he was popularly credited with having a hand in the composition of his master's tragedies.
The author of the Greek Life referred to above preserves some lines of Aristophanes—We may perhaps gather from the present passage that he was supposed to have contributed some of those famous Euripidean monodies of which we have already heard, supra 849, and shall hear more hereafter.
How universal was the belief in his collaboration is shown by the incidental way in which his name is introduced, without the slightest explanation.
And see infra 1408, 1452, 1453.
Others say, and this also is probable enough, that he took part in the representation of his master's dramas.
One of the five extant letters attributed to Euripides is addressed to Cephisophon, announcing the writer's arrival at the Court of Archelaus, and, amongst other things, expressing his indifference to the criticism of Aris- tophanes.
But the letter is no doubt spurious.946. αὐξιών]
That is, the Prologist.
The TO σαυτου̑ in the next line is of course another allusion to the maternal greengrocer.
used adverbially, as frequently in Aris- tophanes, or for κάλλιστΟν, as Euripides employs it in Troades 1282, where Hecabe says:
Either way, the περίπατος of the MSS.
and Edd. seems impossible, and I have substituted περιπατεῖν. " This is not the best of themes for you, of all men, to expatiate upon."
He is alluding to the περιπάτοις of 942 supra.
The line in the translation is rather an explanation than a version.
Dionysus is of course referring generally to the antidemo- cratical tendencies of the school to which Euripides belonged.
His pupils mentioned below, Theramenes and Olei- tophon, were both active promoters of the establishment of the Four Hundred.
Theramenes is indeed described by both Thucydides and Aristotle (widely as they differ in details) as the prime agent of that antidemocratic revolution.
—Thuc. viii. 68 ;
Polity of Athens, 32.
And though Cleitophon afterwards pro- posed to restore the constitution of Cleisthenes, he did so on the express ground that it was not democratic.- Polity of Athens, 34.
Euripides him- self, as Hermann observes, had left democratic Athens, and spent his last years in the Court of King Archelaus of Macedon.954.
τουτουσί]
He glances at the audience as he speaks.
For of course it is to the audience that he is referring as well by τουτουσὶ here as by οὗτοι six lines below.956.

These accusatives are governed by ε'δίδαξα, and not, as Fritzsche supposed, by λαλεῖν.

Look at his pupils, look at mine:
and there the contrast view.
Uncouth Megaenetus is his, and rough Phormisius too;
seems descriptive rather of the refine- ments which Euripides had introduced into the tragic art, than of the subtle- ties which he had taught the Athenian people.
Very possibly it is interpolated from some other passage.
εἰσβολαὶ here, as infra '1104, involves the idea of attacks or incursions.
He attacks, with his new rules of art, the rudeness of ancient tragedy.
γωνιασμοὺς, like σμιλεύ- ματα, supra 819, is a metaphor from the carpenter's art.
There Euripides is described as finishing off his work with a chisel:
here, as employing the car- penter's angle, or, as we less correctly designate it, his square.963.
Κύκνους ... Μέμνονας]
Cycnus the son of Poseidon, and Memnon the son of the Morning, were allies of Priam in the Trojan war, coming, like Rhesus, in the splendour of barbaric trappings, πολλοῖσι σὺν κώδωσιν.
Both of them had the honour of falling by the hand of Achilles.
We do not know in which of his tragedies Aeschylus introduced Cycnus :
but Memnon was represented in two tragedies, the Memnon and the Psychostasia.
For though Welcker thinks that these were two names of one and the same tragedy, Hermann and Wagner are no doubt right in considering them the names of two suc- cessive tragedies in the same trilogy.
In the Psychostasia (as we know from Eustathius on Iliad, viii. 73, and other authorities) the lives of Achilles and Memnon are weighed by Zeus in those golden balances which are more than once brought forward in the Iliad to decide the fate of heroes.
In such com- pounds as κωδωνοφαλαροπώλουςΕuripides is of course imitating and ridiculing the phraseology of Aeschylus.965.

Inthe following year, immediately after the surrender of Athens, we find this typical disciple of Aeschylus associated with the two typical disciples of Euri- pides mentioned just below, in an endeavour to restore the ancient constitu- tion, τὴν πάτρτον πολιτείαν, of Athens, in a moderate and equitable form.- Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 34.
A little later, after the downfall of the Thirty, we find him proposing to re- strict the franchise to persons holding land, and assailed on that account by Lysias in a speech still extant, for attempting to destroy τὴν πάτριον πολι- τείαν.
Not that this implies any incon- sistency on the part of Phormisiu s.
The πάτριος πολιτεία which the Athenians were permitted to restore, was susceptible of more than one interpretation (Polity of Athens, ubi supra).
To Phormisius it doubtless meant the old Solonian constitution;
in the speech of Lysias it represents the unbridled democracy which preceded and occasioned the fall of Athens.
Here the allusion is partly to his rough hirsute appearance.
See the note on Eccl. 97. Of Megaenetus and his nickname ὁ Μανῆς, nothing is known.
Μανῆς was a common servile name, and occurs as such in the Peace, the Birds, and the Lysistrata.
And some think that Megaenetus was so called because of his (supposed) barbarian extraction.
More probably it was de- rived from his constant presence at the game of cottabus, where the little statuette with which the game was played, was called the Μανῆς or "Jack."
See the note on Peace 1244.
Athenaeus quotes many passages from the comic poets relating to this Manes.
One is from Hermippus describing the changes consequent on the departure of citizens for the way
The rod for the cottabus used of yore
Is now in the dustbin thrown,
The small bronze Manes will hear no more
The plash of the wine which it heard before, And I saw the tiny and well-poised plate Forlorn by the hinge of the garden gate
In the refuse and dirt, alone.
And again:
I am the prize which he will get Who deftliest hits the statuette (that is, the Μανῆς).
In the following line these two Aeschyleans are described by two epi- thets of almost more than Aeschylean proportions.
On the first, σαλπιγγο-Great long-beard-lance-and-trumpet-men, flesh-tearers with the pine :
But natty smart Theramenes, and Cleitophon are mine.
Dio.
Theramenes ?
a clever man and wonderfully sly :
Immerse him in a flood of ills, he'll soon be high and dry,the second, the latter part πιτυοκάμπται carries us back to the legendary robber Sinis, who tied his victims to two pine- trees which he had bound together, and which, when let go, tare them limb from limb by the rebound.
Theseus, on his journey from Tro'ezene to Athens, made Sinis himself undergo the cruel death he had loved to inflict upon others.
The prefix σαρκασμο- refers to this rending of flesh."
The secondary meaning which some would give it ama- rulento risu Sinidem referentes (Brunck) has really nothing to recommend it.967.
Κλειτοφῶν ... θηραμένης]
Of Theramenes we have already heard, supra 541.
Cleitophon is twice named in the Polity of Athens as a well-known politician of these days.
One instance (from chap. 34) is given in the preceding note ;
and he had previously, in chap.
29, been mentioned as taking an active part in the proceedings which resulted in the establishment of the Four Hundred.
See the note on 953 supra.
He was doubtless the philosophic stu- dent who, in the remarkable Platonic dialogue which bears his name, displays such a keen appreciation of the sterility of the Socratic method, and shows himself determined to obtain some more definite teaching, even if, to obtain it, he has to go over to Thrasymachus.
There is much probability in Mr. Grote's suggestion (Plato, chap. 32) that the Cleitophon was originally designed as the introduction to the great con- structive discourse on Justice which we know as the Republic of Plato, but was eventually discarded for the present first book in which the same characters appear, but which does not so con- vincingly expose the necessary barren- ness of the negative method of Socratic criticism.969.
περιπέοῃ]
The translation does not reproduce the exact meaning of the original.
In this passage κακοῖς περι- πίπτειν means, not to fall into troubles, but to fall into the midst of, so as to be encompassed by, troubles.
Then the words πλησίον παραστῇ carry us a step further.
Theramenes is close to, and on the very verge of falling into, troubles, when by an acrobatic feat he contrives to fall outside them, leaving his adver- saries to fall in.
The allusion, no doubt, is to the shocking events which followed the battle of Arginusae.
The victorious generals complained of his neglect to pick up the dead and drowning (Xen. Hell., ii. 3. 35), and he was in great peril, but by a fatal exercise of in- genuity, he wriggled outside the peril and pushed the generals in.970.
οὐ Χῖος ἀλλὰ Κεῖοs]
If his faction were defeated, Dionysus means, he would devise some subtle distinction which would enable him to escape, whilst leaving his comrades in the lurch.
Suppose that his faction were called the " Chian," and some accuser were to say "Surely this fellow is a Chian," he would reply "Yes :
the name is so pro- nounced, but mark the difference:
I" (to quote Sir C. C. Clifford's transla- tion) " I spell me with a kappa, not a chi.
No Chian, but a Kian, at your service.
"The sole reason for selecting the words Xîος and Κεῖος is their similarity of sound:
and the learning with which some critics, both ancient and modern, have confused a very simple passage is altogether misplaced.
There is no allusion to the circumstance that Χῖος stands for the highest, and Κῷος for the" A Kian with a kappa., sir, not Chian with a chi."EUR.
I taught them all these knowing ways

And manage all their households too Far better than they used to do, Scanning and searching What's amiss ?
And,
Why was that ?
And,

Dio.
Ay, truly, never now a man Comes home, but he begins to scan;
And to his household loudly cries, Why, where's my pitcher ?

And where's the garlic vanished, pray, I purchased only yesterday ?

lowest, cast of the dice :
nor yet to any supposed difference in the character- istics of the Chians and the Ceans:
whilst the notion that Theramenes was himself a Cean (Scholiast at 541 supra;
Plutarch, Nicias, chap.
2) seems to have arisen merely from a faulty interpreta- tion of the passage before us.
We know- that he was an Athenian and the son of an Athenian.990.
Μαμμάκυθοι Μελιτίδοι]
Melitides was an Athenian of such remarkable stupidity,' that his name in common speech was synonymous with a " block- head."
Many allusions to him in this character are collected by Perizonius on Aelian, V. H. xiii. 15, and by Mitchell,Fritzsche, and others here.
Thus Eustar thius on Od. x. 552 says:
ό Μελιτίδης διαβολήν.
To the like effect Suidas, s. v. γέλοιοs.
Do you take me for a Melitides?
asks Theomnestus in Lucian's Amores, 53, meaning
Do you take mefor a fool ?
And Apuleius in his Apology, Oration i, observes Inter socordissimos Scythas Ana- charsis sapiens natus est:
apud Athe- nienses catos Melitides fatuus.
Didymus (in Schol.) and Suidas think that Μαμμάκυθος was also the name of a real person, but it is only a vulgar nickname for a babyish fool, like βλιτομάμμας in Clouds 1001, and our "mammy-suck" or "molly-coddle."
It gave its name to a play of Metagenes or (some say) Plato Comicus.
Here it is an adjective, " doltish Melitideses," and so the gram- marians mostly take it.
The Scholiast explains it by μαμμόθρεπτος, Photius by μωρὸς kαὶ τηθαλλαδοῦς, Hesychius by μωρός.992. τάδε μὲν λεύσσειςΚ.T.λ.]
This, the Scholiast tells us, is the first line of the Myrmidons of Aeschylus.
It is apparently spoken by the Myrmidon Chorus, appealing to their chieftain to lead them forth to the battle.
The "things which Achilles beheld" were the utter discomfiture of the Greeks, and the victorious pursuit of the Tro- jans up to the very coast where the ships were lying.
The actual incident of the firing of the ships, an incident in which the ξουθὸς ίππαλεκτρυὼν (supra 932) played so distinguished a part, was doubtless related by a messenger later on.
Harpocration (s. v. προπεπω.
κότες)adds two more lines, which, how- ever, do not form a complete sentence, δοριλυμάντους Δαναῶν μόχθους οῦς εἴσω κλισίας.
But as Harpocration is quoting the passage to illustrate the use of προπεπωκότες in the sense of προδεδω- κότες, it is obvious that the word προ- πεπωκὼς is required.
Many suggestions as to its insertion have been made, but none satisfactory.
And perhaps it is better to consider οὓς an accidental repetition of the preceding -ους, and read:
-CHOR. "
All this thou beholdest, Achilles our boldest."
And what wilt thou reply ?
Draw tight the rein
Lest that fiery soul of thine
Whirl thee out of the listed plain, Past the olives, and o'er the line.
Dire and grievous the charge he brings.
See thou answer him, noble heart, Not with passionate bickerings.
Shape thy course with a sailors art, Reef the canvas, shorten the sails, Shift them edgewise to shun the gales.
This little ode, introducing Aeschylus's case, is antistrophical to that which, supra 895-904, introduced the case of Euripides.995.
ἐκτὸς τῶν ἐλαῶν] "
Rein up your fiery courage, for it is apt to start out of the course," is the advice alleged (in Quentin Durward, chap. 5) to have been given by Louis XI to the nobles of France.
The "olives" were a row of trees planted across the end of the Hippodrome.
They formed the limit of the course, within which the driver was required to keep his horses. ἐν ἐχώρει.— Scholiast.1001.
ᾄξεις... Φυλάξεις]
Probably these particular words were selected for the sake of their jingling rhyme.
See 463 supra, and the note there.
They refer to naval evolutions of attack and defence, ἀἵσσειν meaning to move rapidly for- ward to the attack, and φυλάσσειν (Latin, cavere) to be on one's guard against the enemy's onslaught.
"
Do not act in a stormy, tempestuous manner," the Chorus say to Aeschylus ;
" wait till the breeze is calm and settled, and then more and more you can urge your ship against your opponent, and be on your guard against his onset."
The expression μᾶλλον μᾶλλον ᾄξεις may remind the reader of the description which Diodorus (xiii. 77) gives of the Lacedaemonians, ever quickening their speed for the purpose of overtaking the fleet of Conon before it could take refuge in the harbour of Mytilene:
1004.
πυργώσας ῥήματα σεμνά]
With these words Milton's well-known ex- pression "to build the lofty rhyme" (Lycidas 11) is compared by Bp. Blom- field on Persae 197, and by many others since.
Perhaps the best commentary is the seventeenth epigram of Dioscorides, " On Tragedy "—He was the first," says Mr. Haigh, ., not only to exalt and ennoble the spirit of tragedy, but also to clothe it in a form of suitable magnificence and to . build up the structure of splendid phrases.'
His language serves as a fitting vehicle for the expression of his mighty conceptions.
It is cast in the same majestic mould as his heroes and heroines.
His verse is a massive structure, built together with materials of imposing size and strength."
"
In the words of Dionysius, it resembles one of those vast piles of Cyclopean masonry, built of huge and unhewn blocks, before which the smooth and polished workmanship of later build- ings sinks into insignificance.

Hal., Comp. Verb. c. 22."—Tragic Drama of the Greeks, ii. 5.1005.
τραγικὰν λῆραν]
We may con- jecture that tragic poets had spoken with contempt of comedy as mere Τρυγικὸν λῆρον, and that this is the retort τῶν τρυγῳδῶν.
And possibly this is the meaning of the Scholiast's comment, ὅτιἀλλήλαυς διαβάλλουσικωμικαὶκαὶ τρα- γικοί.1009.
βελτίους]
In this proposition the two poets could readily agree ;
but as to what constituted " better citizens " their opinions would be widely at variance.
The ideal of a good citizen was, to Aeschylus, the valiant, noble- minded, and generous Athenian of the Persian wars ;
to Euripides, the shrewd, quick-witted, and inquisitive Athenian of the Peloponnesian War.1012.
τεθνάναι]
In 177 supra, the joke consisted in a dead man dooming him- self to life, just as a living man might doom himself to death.
Here we have the opposite joke, which consists in dooming to death a man already dead :
γελοίαυ χάριν εἶπεν, says the Scholiast, ἤδη γὰρ ἀπέθανε.1014.
τετραπήχεις]
The word, like our epithet " tall" in Shakespeare's time, refers in this passage not so much to physical stature as to a stout and soldierly spirit.
In Wasps 553 it re- fers chiefly to the social importance of the persons so described.
With δια- δραο ιπολίτας Spanheim compares the διαδεδρακάτας of Ach. 601.
The. words ὥσπερ νῦν in the following line are, by look or tone or gesture, directed to the audience.1017.
θυμοὺς έπταβαίους] 'AMri ταῦ μεγάλαυς' ἀπὰ μεταφ
ορᾶς τῆς ἀσπίδ
ος ταῦ Αἴαντας.—Scholiast.
The epithet occurs four times in the short narrative of the duel between Aias and Hector (Iliad, vii. 220-266), and always in reference to the mighty shield of Aias, which was formed of seven folds of tough bull-hide, with one plate of bronze superadded.
But what Aeschylus wants is not so much the strong unyielding shield as the strong unyielding spirit.1023.
πεπαιήκας]
At first sight we should certainly be disposed to inter- pret this (with Brunck and others), "You represented the Thebans as the better soldiers," that is, "as the victors over their Seven opponents."
But both the change of tense (from the aorist to the perfect) and the reply of Aeschylus show that this is not the true inter- pretation, and that Dionysus really meant that the effect of that play was to awaken new military ardour in the hearts of the Thebans, and to make them better warriors than they had previously been.
And in truth the interruption of Dionysus would, on Brunck's interpretation, be altogether pointless:
since the defeat of the Septem was not an invention of Aes- chylus, but ancient history, well known in Homer's day nor were the Athe- nians interested more in the invaders than in the defenders of Thebes.1024.
τύπτου]
He suits the action to the word, and administers a gentle tap to Aeschylus.
In the next line aura is rightly explained by the Scholiast to mean τὰ πολεμικά.
But men who were breathing spears and helms, and the snow-white plume in its crested pride
The greave, and the dart, and the warriors heart in its sevenfold casing of tough bull-hide.
He'll stun me, I know, with his armoury-work;
this business is going from bad to worse.
And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse?
Come, Aeschylus, answer, and don't stand mute in your self-willed pride and arrogant spleen.
A drama I wrote with the War-god filled.
DI.

AE.
'Tis the " Seven against Thebes " that I mean.
Which whoso beheld, with eagerness swelled to rush to the battlefield there and then.
0 that was a scandalous thing you did !
You have made the Thebans mightier men, More eager by far for the business of war.
Now, therefore, receive this punch on the head.
Ah, ye might have practised the same yourselves, but ye turned to other pursuits instead.
Then next the " Persians " I wrote, in praise of the noblest deed that the world can show, And each man longed for the victors wreath, to fight and to vanquish his country's foe.
I was pleased, I own, when I heard their moan for old Darius, their great king, dead ;
εἶπεν.—Scholiast.
This is confirmed by the arguments of the plays.
The Persae was acted B.C. 472 ;
the Septem, B.C. 467.1028.
τὸν θρῆνον ἀκούσας]
I have sub- stituted these words for the unmetrical ἡνίκ' ἤκουσα of the MSS., which (as others also have observed) is most prob- ably a gloss on, and has taken the place of, the participle ἀκούσας.
But then the question arises, What was it that Diony- sus rejoiced to hear ?
He identifies it in the following line with the Choral cry ῖαυοῖ. Now, in the lamentable in- vocation addressed to the dead Darius (Persae 625-676), we find a refrain βόσκε πάτερ ἄκακε 'Δαρειὰν, οἶ.Bp. Blom- field changes Δαρειὰν, οἶιnto Δαρεῖ' lavol, a change which is approved by Dobree and Fritzsche, and is probably right.
And anyhow Dionysus appears to be referring to that particular ode.
But that ode is a θρῆνος, and is indeed so called by-the kingly ghost, ίμεῖς 8i θρηνεῖτ' ἐγγὺς ἑστῶτες τάφοι', Persae 682.
It is, in truth, a θρῆνος περὶ Δαρείου τεθνεῶτος. By inserting τόν θρῆνον therefore in the line before us, we satisfy at once the sense, the metre, and the reference to the Persae.
Diony- sus was delighted with the wild Eastern coronach which Aeschylus had brought on the Athenian stage.
The only other readings worthy of mention are (1) the introduction from one or two very in- ferior MSS.
of ἡνίκ' ἀπηγγέλθη, to which nothing in the Persae answers :
and which is rightly styled by Fritzsche "con- iectura audacissima et infelicissima' of some grammarian :
and (2) Fritzsche's own νικῆσ
οι ὰκούσαςοr τῇ νίκῃ ἀκούσας, to which the same objection applies, which requires the further alteration of περὶ into παρὰ, and depends on the resem- blance of νικη to ἡνίκα, although ἡνίκα has already been accounted for in the change of ἡνίκ' ἤκουσα a into ἀκούσας.

Of the four poets put forward as benefactors of the human race, Homer and Hesiod are as familiar to us now as they were to the Athenians 2300 years ago.
The other two, Orpheus and Musaeus, whose names are usually coupled together, are wellnigh lost in the mists of antiquity.
But the institution of the sacred rites of mystical initiation, τὰς τελετὰς, is by all authorities attributed to Orpheus, and sometimes Musaeus is connected with him in this work, and sometimes he is connected with Musaeus in the work τη̑ς χρησμῳδίας.
In the Protagoras of Plato, chap. viii, Protagoras says that those who practised τὴv σαφιστικὴν τχνην in old days, disguised the fact by pre- tending to practise some other art, τοὺς See also Plato's Republic, ii.

When they smote together their hands, like this, and Evir alake the Chorus said.
Aye, such are the poet's appropriate works:
and just consider how all along
From the very first they have wrought you good, the noble bards, the masters of song.
First,
Orpheus taught you religious rites, and from bloody murder to stay your hands:
Musaeus healing and oracle lore ;
and Hesiod all the culture of lands, The time to gather, the time to plough.
And gat not Homer his glory divine
By singing of valour, and honour, and right, and the sheen of the battle-extended line, The ranging of troops and the arming of men ?
Dio.
0 ay, but he didn't teach that, I opine, To Pantacles;
when he was leading the show I couldn't imagine what he was at, He had fastened his helm on the top of his head, he was trying to fasten his plume upon that.
But others, many and brave, he taught, of whom was Lamachus, hero true;
And thence my spirit the impress took, and many a lion-heart chief I drew,Doubtless he restrained men from murder by excluding murderers from his sacred rites.
Eustathius seems to think that the words άκέσειςνύσν are the title of a medical poem composed by Musaeus (see the Preface to his Commentary on the Iliad) :
and cer- tainly some prescriptions ascribed to Musaeus were known to Pliny (N. H., xxi. 21).
Several of the foregoing passages have been already cited by Spanheim, Bergler, and others.1037. ἒπεμπν] 'Επόμπευεν.—Scholiast.
The accusative nομπὴν, which is usually added—τὴν πομπὴν πέμψαντα, Ach. 248 ;
πέμψοντα τὴνπομπὴν, Birds 849 ;
πομπημν πέμπετε, Eccl. 757—is here understood.
The speaker is referring to an incident which mightily amused the Athenian crowd, and earned for Pantacles the nickname of Σκαιός.
As the procession was moving on, he was discovered bust- ling forward with both hands busy on the top of his head, vainly endeavouring to rectify a mistake in his ὂπλισις.
He had forgotten to fasten his plume] into his helmet before putting the helmet on, and was trying to do it after- wards.

Λάμαχοςήρως]
Here, even more markedly than in the Thesmophoria- zusae, Aristophanes goes out of his wa to offer a tribute of respect to the memory of Lamachus.
In the Achar- nians he had twice addressed him, by way of ridicule, with the words ω̉ Λάμαχ' η̉ρως.
And here he repeats the descrip- tion, no longer in derision, but as accounting him worthy of the traditions of Homer, and worthy of the commenda- tion of Aeschylus.1040.

In his note on this epigram, Jacobs collects various ex- amples of the use of άπομάττομαι in this sense ;
such as the twenty-eighth epi- gram of Callimachus (ed. Blomf.), which speaks of Aratus (called α̒ Σολεὺςfrom his birthplace Soli in Cilicia) as having moulded his poems on the example of Hesiod :

Φαίδρας ... Σθενεβοίας]
The in- cestuous love of Phaedra for her stepson Hippolytus, is the subject of the extant " Hippolytus " of Euripides :
the adulte- rous love of Stheneboea for Bellerophon was doubtless told in the same poet's lost "Stheneboea."
To English readers it is well known from Mr. William Morris's graceful narrative in the " Earthly Paradise."
Each of these unhappy women being repulsed, de- nounced to her husband, after the fashion of Potiphar's wife (see Scholiast on Lucian's De Calumnia, 24), the innocent youth who had repelled her advances.
And finally each of them, in despair and remorse, put an end to her own existence.
The two are coupled together, in a similar way, by Juvenal, x. 325, &c.1044. ov8' οι̉δ' ούδείς]
Spanheim says that he is amazed at this statement ofPatrocluses, Teucers, illustrious names;
for I fain the citizen-folk would spur To stretch themselves to their measure and height, whenever the trumpet of war they hear.
But Phaedras and Stheneboeas?
No !
no harlotry business deformed my plays.
And npne can say that ever I drew a love-sick woman in all my days.
For you no lot or portion had got in Queen Aphrodite.

Thank Heaven for that.

Yourself she cast to the ground at last.

You showed how cuckolds are made, and 10, you were struck yourself by the very same fate
But say, you cross-grained censor of mine, how my Stheneboeas could harm the state.
Full many a noble dame, the wife of a noble citizen, hemlock took, And died, unable the shame and sin of your Bellerophon-scenes to brook.
Was then, I wonder, the tale I told of Phaedra's passionate love untrue ?
Not so:
but tales of incestuous vice the sacred poet should hide from view, Nor ever exhibit and blazon forth on the public stage to the public ken.
Aeschylus, considering the leading part which the adulteress Clytaemnestra takes in the Agamemnon.
But there is much more reason to be amazed at this state- ment of Spanheim.
The Agamemnon of Aeschylus depends upon the fact of the guilty passion of Clytaemnestra, just as, and no more than, the Iliad of Homer depends upon the fact of the guilty passion of her sister Helen.
But neither in the tragedy nor in the epic is there any portrayal of the guilty passion itself, or any analysis or descrip- tion of the feelings of a love-sick woman.1045.

The particularity of the language, not merely " noble dames " but also, with a compliment to their husbands, "wives of noble men," seems to point to some real occurrence, well known to the audience, though to us unknown.
We may safely infer that some highborn lady had taken hemlock, in disgust at the calumnies lavished on her sex.
But whether the plays of Euripides had any part in bringing about the catastrophe it is impossible now even to conjecture.

It must be re- membered that Aeschylus himself was the inventor of the grand style, not only in the thoughts and language, but even in the costume, the masks, the scenery, and indeed in every other de- partment of tragedy.
In all things he aspired to make his actors the worthy representatives of the heroes and demi- gods whose names they bore on the stage.

He is referring of course to the public λειτουργία, the duty cast upon a wealthy citizen of equip- ping a warship for the state (Knights 912), a duty, however, from which he could escape by proving that his for- tune was inadequate for its fulfilment.

We are BOUND things honest and pure to speak.

And to speak great Lycahettuses, pray, And massive blocks of Parnassian rocks, is that things honest and pure to say ?
In human fashion we ought to speak.

Alas, poor witling, and can't you see
That for mighty thoughts and heroic aims, the words themselves must appropriate be ?

No more will a wealthy citizen now equip for the state a galley of war.
He wraps his limbs in tatters and rags, and whines he is poor, too poor byfar.

But under his rags he is.

Let him gull the state, and he's off to the mart;
an eager, extravagant buyer of fish.
AES.
Moreover to prate, to harangue, to debate, is now the ambition of all in the state.here:
" neque enim Euripidei reges pannis obsiti earn vim habere poterant ut ditissimus quisque civis trierarchiam detrectaret."
But this is to take Aristo- phanes too literally.
He is really for the moment leaving Euripides alone, and seizing the opportunity offered of sati- rizing some rich Athenian who had recently shirked his public duty on the unfounded plea of inadequate resources.
φω̑ν εύρι̉σκεται. — Scholiast.
'Εν TOtS ίχθύσιν for in the fish-market occurs in Wasps 789 διεκερματίζετ' έν τοι̑ς ίχύσιν (where see the note):
and so Anti- phanes (Athenaeus, vii. 28) ἒτοπόνγε κηρττουσιν έν τοι̑ς ίχθύσιν Κήρυγμα.
That fish was one of the greatest luxuries of the Athenian epicure is well known ;
that its purchase required a well-filled purse is amusingly illustrated by the account which Timocles (Ath. vi. 39) gives of the straits to which the notorious glutton and parasite Corydus was reduced, when he was obliged to cater for himself in the fish-market with only τέτταρας χαλκου̑ςιn his pocket.
άνέκυψεν means he emerged, turned up as we might say.1069. ει̉τ’ αὖ λαλιάν]
The last section of the speech of Aeschylus, like the last section of the speech of Euripides, is concerned with the argumentative loquacity with which (they both agree) Euripides has inspired the rising genera- tion.
Euripides vaunts it as one of his chief merits;
Aeschylus arraigns it as one of his greatest offences.1070.
έξεκέύσε ray παλαὶστρας]
Berg- ler compares the very similar charge brought against the sophistical teaching in Clouds 1054.
The orator in [Ando- cides] against Alcibiades (22) makes a like complaint of the Athenian youth, γαρου̑σι δὲ oi νεώτε
ροι.
The words which follow, τὰς πυγὰς ένέτριψε, are generally thought to refer to the vilest of crimes.
"
Qui rhetoricae, politicae, aliisque hums generis artibus operam dabant," says Brunck, " impudicitiae crimine notantur a Comico " ;
and he refers to Eccl.
112, where see the note.
My translation is based upon this interpretation ;
but I doubt if that is the true meaning of the passage before us, since the πα- λαὶσ
τρα would hardly be contrasted with a vice with which it was itself notoriously tainted, Wasps 1025, Peace 762:
and see Clouds 976.
Probably Aeschylus merely means that the youngsters forsook the athletic exer- cises, which invigorated all their members, and wore away their πυγὰς by for ever sitting on the hard benches (see Knights 785) whether of the sophistical schools or of the popular assemblies.
And this is more in conformity with the next speech of Aeschylus.
νεώς.—Scholiast.
I think that the Scholiast must be right in refusing to confine the word in this passage to the crew of a single vessel;
but on the other hand I believe that Aristophanes is making use of a studied ambiguity, and intended a covert allusion to the political aud partisan spirit which dis- tinguished that particular crew, and of which Thucydides, always the best exponent of Aristophanes, does, as Fritzsche observes, take special notice in his History, viii.
73. All the old Lexi- cographers—Hesychius, Harpocration, Photius, Suidas-define Πάραλαλοι as the crew of the Πάραλος.
And this is the general signification of the word in classical writers.
Each exercise-ground is in eonsequence found deserted and empty:

AESCH.
Of what ills is he NOT the creator and eause ?
Scholiast;
the rhythmical cry to which the oars kept time.
See Wasps 909 and the note there.
πρῳ̄ραν.—Scholiast, the last sentence means (as Mr. Smith of Jordanhill in his Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul," p. 184, well explains it) that the three rows did not sit in a vertical line, so that the ζυγι̉της sat exactly under the θρανιτης, and exactly over the θαλα- μιτης, but in a, slanting line;
the θαλαμιτης sitting a little lower than, but not directly beneath, the ζυγιτης ;
and the ζυγιτηςa little lower than, but not directly beneath, the θρανιτης.
Ex- cept therefore at the extreme end, each θαλαμιτης (or as he is here called θαλά- μαξ, or as in the Scholiast and elsewhere θαλάμιος) sat between two ζυγι̑ται each on a higher level than himself, and be- tween two θρανι̑ται on a higher level still.
The θαλαμίτης, as the Scholiast also observes, used, being nearest the water, the shortest oar, and received the smallest pay.1075.
μιθω̑σαι]
To bedaub with dung.
Allusion is made in Eccl. 647, 648;
Plutus 313, 314, to an instance of this horseplay, of which one Aristyllus was the willing, or unwilling, victim.1076. άντιλέγέει]
Here, as indeed in έκβὰς in the preceding, line, is one of those changes from plural to singular which constantly occur in these come- dies.
See for example the note on Wasps 554.
Fritzsche thinks that Dionysus is here referring to what took place after the battle of Arginusae, when the generals being divided in opinion as to whether they should sail at once to Mitylene or stay to pick up the floating τω̑ν νεκρω̑ν.
-Diod.
Sic. xiii. 100.
And if this be so, it affords a strong argument in favour of the wider signification given to ταὺς παράλ
ους, supra 1071.
But probably Aristophanes is not specially referring to one isolated instance of insubordination.
1079.
ροαγωγὺςκ.τ.λ.]
The Scholiast and Commentators supply specimens' of the characters to which Aeschylus is taking objection.
The nurse in the Hippolytus is a sufficient example of the προαγωγός.
We know from Clemens Alexandrinus (Strom. vii. 4. 23) that Aage, in the tragedy called by her name, not only gave birth to a child (Telephus) in Athene's temple, but, on Athene's expressing her indignation at such conduct, entered into a truly Euripidean argument to convince the goddess that her anger was illogical, Aristophanes had already, in Clouds 1372, denounced the portrayal, in the Aeolus, of the incestuous loves of Ma- careus and Canace, the children of Aeolus.
And cf. supra 850, 863, and infra 1475, and the notes there.
And as to the suggestion that Life is Death " see supra 420 and infra 1477.1083.
έκ τούτων]
And hence it is, says Aeschylus, that the city is full of under- clerks and demagogue-buffoons who are always deceiving the people.
The latter words, έξαπατώντων τὸν δη̑μον άεὶ, apply to both classes alike.
And, by omitting them, Meineke has struck out the only ground which Aristophanes gives for objecting to these ύπογραμαμματὶς.
Euripides is accused, not of merely filling the city with ιπογραμματϊς (who in their place might be useful enough), but of filling it with ύπογραμματεϊς who, presuming on the argumentative clever- ness which he had taught them, in- truded themselves into the public dis- cussions, and so were for ever deceiving the people.
By the term ύπογραμματει̑ς we are not to understand the holders of any particular office:
they were under-clerks of any description, who, as Dr. Holden truly remarks, were amongst the lowest and most despised of the citizens.
Dr. Holden very appro- priately cites Lysias against Nicomachus, 37, "Our forefathers selected men such as Solon and Themistocles and Pericles to make their laws;
but ye choose Tisamenus and Nicomachus, καὶ έτέρουςάνθρώπους ύπογραμματέας."
And Dr. Blaydes adds Demosthenes, de Falsa Legatione, 262, "We think ὺπογραμ- ματέαςκαὶτοὺς τυχόνταςάνθώπ

"1086.
ἐξαπατῶντων TOP δῆμον]
These are the words of a comic poet:
but the self-same language is held by both Xenophon and Aristotle about the events of this troubled period.
The condemna- tion of the victorious generals after Arginusae is in the Polity of Athens, chap.
34, ascribed to this trickery, ἐξαπατηθένος ταῦ δήμου διὰ τοὺς παρ
οργί- σαντας.
And Xenophon (Hellenics, i. 7. 39) says that before long the Athenians repented of this terrible act, and resolved to prosecute the men who τὰν δῆμαν ἐξηπάτησαν.
So the people are described as rejecting the last overtures of Sparta, ἐξαπατηθέντες ὑπὸ ΚλεοΦῶντος.—Polity of Athens, chap. 34. And cf. Id. ch. 28.1087.
λαμπάδα... Φέρειν]
From want of athletic training nobody is able any longer now to carry the torch in the races.
The allusion is to the torchrace, A αμπαδηΦορία, in the special form which it assumed at the Panathenaea, and probably at some other festivals.
The course, com- mencing, as Pausanius tells us (Attica, xxx. 2), from the altar of Prometheus, situated in that part of the outer Cerameicus which afterwards became so famous under the name of the Academy, passed through the Thriasian gates (otherwise called τὸ Δίπυλον) and on to the Acropolis of Athens.
Each runner carried a flaming torch, and the race was won, not necessarily by the man who arrived first at the goal, but by him who was the first to arrive with his torch unextinguished.
The Academy was nearly a mile beyond the Thriasian gates, which divided the outer from the inner Cerameicus, so that the entire course was somewhat long and arduous for an untrained runner.
This torch- race must not be confounded with that which was run at the Hephaesteia, when the torch was passed on by one runner to another (Hdt. viii. 98), though doubt- less both started from the same place, since the altar at the entrance of thegreat τέμενος of Athene in the Academy seems to have been common to both Prometheus and Hephaestus.
See the Scholiast on Oed. Col. 56.1089. ἐπαΦαυάνθην] Ἐξηράνθην.—Scho- liast.
My throat was parched with laugh- ing.

ὑπαλειπόμενας]
Falling behind, and so becoming one of the laggards mentioned in the next note.
The words δεινὰ ποιῶν making a dreadful pother are wide enough to include any contortions or noises which a tired runner may make, grimaces, gesticulations, puffing and blowing, groaning, or the like.1093. ot Κεραμῆς]
Οἱ τὸν Κεραμεικὸν οἰκοῦντες.—
Scholiast.
They were so much in the habit of administering these pleasant little attentions to the laggards in the torchrace, that Κεραμεικαὶ πληγαὶ became, according to the Scholiast, a well-recognized phrase.
The Scholiast quotes the following lines from the earlier Plutus of Aristophanes :
—The suggestion of Ritter (Dissertation on the Plutus) and Bergk (in Meineke's Fragm.
Com. Graec. ii. 1130) that these words are spoken of Poverty is in the highest degree improbable ;
see Plutus 559-561.
They were more probably spoken of Ἀργία, 'Ἀγ υμνασία or some other attendant on wealth.
The gates at which the slappers awaited the runners were of course the ThriasianDio.
By the Powers, you are right!
At the Panathenaea I laughed till I felt like a potsherd to see a Pale, paunchy young gentleman pounding along, With his head butting forward, the last of the throng, In the direst of straits;
and behold at the gates, The Ceramites flapped him, and smacked him, and slapped him, In the ribs, and the loin, and the flank, and the groin, And still, as they spanked him, he puffed and he panted, Till at one mighty cuff, be discharged such a puff
That he blew out his torch and levanted.
CHOIR.
Dread the battle, and stout the combat, mighty and manifold looms the war.

Nay but don't be content to sitgates, which, however wide themselves, were narrow in comparison with the open roads extending on either side;

With πλατείαις, as the Scholiast observes, we must under- stand χερσὶ, the blows being delivered with the open hand.
1098.
Φυσῶν]
Blowing out, extinguish- ing, the torch.
The participle ὑτο- περδόμενος explains the way in which the torch was extinguished, just as the participle γελῶν, supra 1090, explains the way in which the speaker's throat became parched.
1099.
μέγα τὸ πρᾶγμα κ.τ.λ.]
The serious contest dealing with the real merits and defects of the two dramatists is over;
the minor conflicts which fol- low, the Battles of the Prologues, of the Melodies, and of the Weights, are really little more than flashes of comic wit.
Before they commence, the Chorus sing a trochaic strophe and antistrophe of ten lines each.
The strophe starts with a very polysyllabic line, which at first sight we should hardly suspect of being an ordinary trochaic tetrameter cata- lectic, the exact equivalent of the more sober εἰσβολαὶ γάρ εἰσι πολλαὶ χἄτεραι σοΦισμάτων below.1101.
τείνῃ βιαίως]
Aeschylus presses on with impetuous vehemence like a resistless whirlwind.
Euripides, forced to give way at first, is quick to wheel round and deliver an attack τ
ορῶς, that is, with shrewdness and precision.
The language might well be applied to the combat between a Spanish bull and matador.1103.
μὴ ’ ταύτψ καθῆσθον]
After the four preliminary lines, which refer tothe preceding combat, the Chorus turn to the combatants, and exhort them not to rest content with one trial of skill, that is to say with discussing the general objects and tendencies of their dramatic compositions ;
for there are yet many other onslaughts for their rival wits to deliver.
They have yet to debate those secondary matters of which mention has been made in the note on 1099 supra. '1109.
εἰ δὲ τοῦτο κ.τ.λ.]
No one ean read these comedies without being struck by the confidence which their author exhibits that his entire audience --one might almost say the whole Athenian people—will be shrewd enough and well-read enough at once to detect and appreciate the slightest allusion he may make to the works of their famous tragedians.
Doubtless his confidence as a rule was justified :
yet occasionally of course a point here and there would be missed;
and nowhere would this mishap be more likely to occur than in the ensuing scenes, dealing as they do not with one particular play, but with.
isolated sentences and isolated verses, culled from the whole range of Aeschy- lean and Euripidean literature, old as well as new, τά τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ καινά.
From this antistrophe we may gather that many points were in fast missed on the first exhibition of the Frogs.
And therefore, in the play before us, which is the Frogs as revised for the second performance, the Chorus en- courage the rivals by alleging that this will no longer be the case, οὐκ ἔθ’ οὕτω ταῦτ’ ἔχει.
The audience are now ἐστρατευμένοι, they are no more novices, they have already been through theAlways in one position only :
many the fields for your keen-edged wit.
On then, wrangle in every way, Argue, battle, be flayed and flay, Old and new from your stores display, Yea, and strive with venturesome daring something subtle and neat to say.
Fear ye this, that to-day's spectators lack the grace of artistic lore, , Lack the knowledge they need for taking
All the points ye will soon be making ?
Fear it not:
the alarm is groundless :
that, be sure, is the case no more.
All have fought the campaign ere this :
Each a book of the words is holding;
never a single point they'll miss.
Bright their natures, and now, I ween, Newly whetted, and sharp, and keen.
Dread not any defect of wit,campaign, they have already witnessed the play.
More than that, each has now got a book of the words (βιβλίον, libretto), and so will understand all the witticisms, τὰ δεξιά.
So far as the audience are concerned therefore, θεα- τῶν οὕνεχ’, the poets need be under no apprehension.
This, I think, is the true interpretation of the antistrophe.
Lessing's suggestion that by ἐστρατευ- μένοι we are to understand the slaves who won their freedom at Arginusae is at first somewhat attractive, but the subsequent statement, αἱΦύσειςκράτισται, shows clearly enough that the Chorus are speaking of freeborn Athenian citizens.
The explanations given by the commentators seem to me very wide of the mark.
Differing on the one point whether ἐστρατευμένοι is to be under- stood of real military expeditions, or of studious exercises, they all agree in referring the words βιβλίον τ’ ἔχων ἕκαστος to the increased book-learning of the Athenian people.
Bergler's trans- lation, Nam exercitati sunt, et librum quisque habens discit sapientiam, is adopted without alteration by Brunck.
Mitchell pictures ten or fifteen thou- sand spectators, each with a philo- sophical treatise in his hand."
Bothe observes, " ἐστρατευμένους dicit litterariâ laude claros."
Fritzsche, " prudentiores sunt qui militaverint, propterea quod usu magis sunt exercitati."
Paley, "
The march of intellect in young Athens has been so great that every one now is literary, and has seen the world in many military expe- ditions."
And so Mr. Green and Dr. Merry.1120.
πρῶτον ... πρώτιστον]
Euripides himself says in Medea 475 ἐκ τῶν δὲ πρώτων πρῶτον ἄρξομαι λeyeιν.
The words roi δεξιοῦ are in apposition, so to say, to αὐτοῦ.
Compare Peace 2 δὸς αὐτῷ, τῷ κάκιστ’ ἀπολουμένψ.
We are now commencing the Battle of the Pro- logues.
Scholiast.
The notion that this name included the entire trilogy (or tetralogy) has been too readily accepted, and scholars have possibly been a little too ingenious in discovering or devising special names for special trilogies.
It is not likely that the author himself bestowed a name on the complete trilogy, over and above the names of the several plays;
it is more probable that the wider name subsequently came into use as a convenient mode of refer- ence to a group of plays (whether combined in a trilogy or not) dealing with one and the same personage.
Thus the Prometheus πυρΦόρος, the Prometheus δεσμώτης, the Prometheus λυόμενος, and, it may be, the satyric Prometheus πυρκαεὺς were known as the Prometheuses, οἱ Προμηθεῖς, a name very unlikely to have been given them by Aeschylus himself.
The Δυκουργία may well have comprised the Ἠδωνοὺς, the Βασσαρίδας, the Νεανίσκους, and the satyric Αυκοῦργον (Thesm.
135 and the Scholiast there) since in all these plays Lycurgus appears to have formed the most prominent character.
See Hermann's Opuscula, vol. v.
But it is to my mind inconceivable that so great a play as the Agamemnon should have gone to make up a group which went by the secondary name of the Oresteia.
I be- lieve that the Oresteia meant simply the group of plays which dealt with the story of Orestes, and comprised therefore the Choephoroe, the Eumenides, and possibly other plays, but not the Aga- memnon :
just as the Electra, the Orestes, the Iphigeneia in Tauris, the Andromache, and possibly other plays,Battle away without misgiving, sure that the audience, at least, are fit.

AESCH.
Grave Hermes, witnessing a father's power, Be thon my saviour and mine aid to-day,may have formed the Oresteia of Euripides.
And this seems implied by the present passage.
It is obvious that Euripides is referring to the individual prologue which Aeschylus immediately begins to recite :
and-unless the words can mean, as I have.
translated them, " the well-known prologue " (the pro- logue to the Choephoroe being spoken by the chief character, whilst the prologists of the Agamemnon and Eumenides are subordinate personages who never appear again) -it is difficult, on the assumption that the Oresteia included the entire trilogy, to see how they can have pointed to the prologue of the Choephoroe.
But understand the Oresteia to mean the Orestes-group of plays," and the prologue of the Oresteia can mean nothing else than the prologue of the Choephoroe.
1126.
‛Ερμῆ χθόνιε]
Hermes of the nether world, take to thyself thy fathers power, and become, to me thy suppliant, a saviour and ally:
that is, " as thy father is Zeὺς σωτὴρ, so be thou to me ‛Ερμῆς σωτήρ.”
The appeal is made to Hermes in his character of χθόνιος (πομπαῖον 'Ερμῆν χθόνιον, Ajax 832), because in that character he has already conducted the shade of Agamemnon to the world below, and is about to con- duct thither the shades of Aegistbus and Clytaemnestra.
It seemed necessary to adapt the translation to the pun below, 1149.
ἐποπτεύειν, from its use in connexion with theEleusinian mysteries, acquired the signification of “partici- pating in," as well as "gazing upon."
The expression πατρῷ’ ἐποπτεύων κράτη is explained by Aristophanes in 1146 as equivalent to πατρῷον τοῦτο κέκτηται γέρας.
This passage is notable, not only for the criticism it contains, but because here only has been preserved the noble and solemn exordium of the Choephoroe of Aeschylus.
The Medicean MS. com- mences the play, inappropriately enough, with the words τί χρῆμα λεύσσω ;
and these lines were first restored, to their proper place in Canter's edition, A. D. 1580.1130.
τρία]
Ἔπη ἢ ἰαμβεῖα.—Scholiast.
See three lines below where Dionysus says, " If you don't keep quiet, besides having your τρία ἰαμβεῖα cut up, you will incur further punishment," per- haps threatening to strike him, as supra 1024.
Line 1134 is repeated, with πρίωμαι substituted for σιωπῶ, 1229 infra.1136.
ὁρǫ̑ς ὅτι ληρεῖς ;
] '0 Αἰσχύλος φησὶ πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσαν.—Scholiast.
It is preposterous, he means, to enjoin me to keep silence, in the face of such outrageous attacks as these.
Dionysus had purposed himself to discuss the matter with Euripides:
but the im- petuosity of Aeschylus is not to be gainsaid, and with the words ὀλίγον μοι μέλει, he leaves the poet to take his own course.
So Mitchell rightly under- stands the line.1140.
αὐκ ἄλλως λέγω]
I say not other- wise.
I do not deny it.1141.
ὡς o πατὴρ ἀπώλετα]
To prove the ἀσάφεια of Aeschylus, he affixes to three words in the first line a meaning which Aeschylus never intended, but which they might well bear, and which indeed some eminent critics, both ancient and modern, consider to be their true meaning.
He takes πατρῷα to mean, not "thy father's," but “my father's " ;
ἐπαπτεύων, not "participating in," but "surveying";
and κράτη, not “authority," but “realm."

Does he mean that the god of craft was an onlooker, when Clytaemnestra by craft destroyed her husband?
The descrip- tion of Agamemnon's death is couched in the language of tragedy, and is possibly, as Hermann suggests, itself borrowed from the lost portion of the prologue of the Choephoroe.1144.
οὐ δῆτ’ ἐκεῖνον]
Τὸν δόλιον δηλον- ότι.—Scholiast;
δόλιος being deduced from δόλοις in the preceding line. "
The Ἑρμῆς χθόνιος whom he addressed was not Ἑρμῆς δόλιος, but Ερμῆς ἐριούνιος, and this fact (viz. that it was the ἐριούνιος)
Orestes made clear by saying that he possessed his father's preroga- tive " of saving.
Ἐριούνιος, according to the author of the Etymolog.
Magn., is derived παpa TO ἐρὶ ἐπιτατικὸν Kat τὴν ἄνησιν ὁ μέγα ὠφελῶν, ὠφελιμώτατος γὰρ o Ἑρμῆς.
This all-helpful Hermes might well wield, to some extent, the preroga- tive of his father Zεὐς σωτὴρ, and save Orestes, as in the twenty-fourth Iliad he saved Priam, in his hour of need.
A Greek god possessed many and diverse characters, and almost seemed a distinct personality in each.
Therefore instead of saying, " He invoked Hermes in this, and not in that, character," Aeschylus says, " He invoked not Ἑρμῆν δóλιον but Ἑρμῆν ἐριούνιον,” as if they were two persons, and not the same person viewed in two aspects.
Many, but not all, of theoffices of Hermes are enumerated in Plutus 1153-1170, where he is presented successively as Στροφαῖος, Ἐμπολαῖος, Δό- λιος, Ἡγεμόνιος, Ἐναγώνιος, and Διακονικός.
1149.
τυμβωρύχος]
Euripides again misinterprets the words of Aeschylus, taking πατρῷον γέρος to refer to χθόνιον, whereas it refers to ἐριούνιον.
Dionysus now breaks in with an unseemly joke.
If Hermes is invoked ἐπὶ τῷ τύμβω̩ as χθόνιος or καταχθόνιος, he must be a τυμβωρύχος, and this unsavoury business therefore is what he derived from his father.
τυμβωρύχος, properly a rifler of graves, became (like τοιχωρύχος, Clouds 1327, Plutus 909, 1141, etc.) a simple term of abuse.
Εἰρωνεύῃ ταυ̂τα πρὸς ἐμὲ, says Timocles in Lucian's Jupiter Tragoedus 52, τυμβωρύχε, καὶ μιαρὲ, καὶ κατάπτυστε, Kal μαστιγία, καὶ κάθαρμα.1150.

He means (to adapt the language of the translation), "Bacchus, the joke you make is stale and fusty " ;
but as addressing the god of wine, he substitutes "the wine you drink " for " the joke you make " :
just as in Wasps 525 the old dicast, for κύλικα, the cup, substitutes μισθὸν, the dicasticfee.
The expression οἰνος ἀνθο- σμίας, “ wine with a bouquet,” is of very frequent occurrence.
In Plutus 807 and Achilles Tatius ii.
2 it has the epithet μέλας, blood-red, attached to it;
and in Longus (Pastorals iv.
8) a wine is called ἀνθοσμίας οἰνοs Δέσβιος, ποθῆναι κάλλιστος οἰνοs.
When the Lacedaemonian sol- diers (B.C. 373) found themselves amidst the wealth and luxury of Corcyra, they grew so dainty, Xenophon tells us (Hell. vi. 2, 6), that they would touch no wine, εἰ μὴ ἀνθοσμίας εἴη.

"Chrysostom (de Annâ, v. 3), arguing that the pleasures of the poor are more real than those of the luxurious, says ούχ quotes the recipe for making wine (ἀνθοσμίαυ) given by Phanias the Lesbian philosopher, " Pour one measure of sea- water into 50 measures of new wine, and it becomes ἀνθοσμίας.”
Greek wine generally was noted for its pleasant fragrance, Eur. Cyclops 153 ;
especially the Thasian.1159.
χςη̑σον K. T. λ.]
Lend me a μάκτρα, and also if you please a κάρδοπος ;
the two names of course signifying one and the same thing, viz.
a kneading trough.
μάκτρα is the term used in the Plutus, κάρδοπας in the Clouds.
The words εἰ δὲ βούλειappear to introduce not an alternative, but an addition.
In Xenophon's Memorabilia (iii.
5) Socrates is recounting the military achievements of Athens:
"Consider," he says, “ their successes in old time under Erechtheus and Theseus, and add what in later days their descendants have done, ἕπραξαν.”
So the Platonic Socrates (Phaedrus, chap. 5), dilating on the amenities of the spot to which Phaedrus has brought him, enumerates the plane- tree, the willow, the stream, and goes on εἰ δ' αὖβούλει (and besides) how sweet and pleasant is the air.
In Alciphron (iii. 18) a writer, inviting his friend to a merrymaking, says, "And do not come alone, but bring your wife and children, εἰ βούλοιο δὲ καì τὴν κύνα."1160.
κατεστωμυμένε]
You chatterbox of a man.
The words are apparently addressed to Dionysus, just as in Birds 1638 Heracles says, ὦ δαιμόνι' ἀνθρώπων Πόσειδον. And cf. infra 1472.
“Hinc opinor," says Fritzsche, " Phrynichus, Bekkeri, p. 45, 25, κατστωμυλμένος ά πολλη̜̃ τη̜̃ στωμυλία̜ χρώμενος.”
But it is very probable that the word is borrowed by Aristophanes from one of the lost plays of Aeschylus.
—Scholiast.
When you say that a man ἥκει to a country, Aeschylus means, you merely denote his arrival and nothing else :
χωρὶς ἄλλης ξυμΦορα̑ς without any other circumstance:
but when you say that he κατέρχεται you introduce an- other circumstance, viz. that he is an exile returning to his fatherland.1167.
κατελθεῖ]
Euripides replies that κατελθζῖν really means to be re- called, and is therefore inapplicable to Orestes.
His contention may seem to derive some countenance from such phrases as that in Thuc. viii.
68 νομίζων αρχίας κατελθεῖν :

AESCH.
Now on this funeral mound I call my father To hear, to hearken.
EUR.
There he is again.
To " hear,” to " hearken ” ;
the same thing, exactly.κατελθεῖν, as well as κατιέναι, is commonly used in the wider meaning which Aes- chylus gives it here.
In the Antigone of Sophocles (200) Polyneices is called φυγὰς κατζλθών;
in Hdt. v. 30 the Naxian exiles beseech Aristagoras to assist them by force, κατελθεῖν ἐς τὴν ἑωυτω̑ν ;
in Hdt. v. 62 the exiled Alc- maeonids who fortified Leipsydrium are described as πειρώμενοι κατιέναι and numberless other passages might be cited in which these words are em- ployed without any thought of recall.
The word λάθρα̣ in 1168 is not of the essence of the objection :
it merely em- phasizes the fact that Orestes was not recalled by the rulers of the state.
1173.
κλύειν, ἀκαυ̑σαι]
There is prob- ably no substantial distinction between these two words ;
the κλύοντες αύκ ἥκουον of Prometheus 456 resembles the ἀκουον- τες οὐκ ἀκούουσινοf St. Matthew's Gospel:
and the joke with which Dionysus closes the discussion justifies, rather than denies, the alleged tautology.
Fritzsche happily retorts on Enripides his own offences with the same words;
ούκ ἕκλυον, οὐκ ἥκουσο.—Phoen. 919. ἄίες ὦ, ἕκλυες ὦ.—Hipp. 362.
And John Wordsworth (in Conington's note on the present line in the Choephoroe) collects a number of similar repetitions from the plays of Euripides.
1176.
τρὶς λέγοντες]
He is alluding, as Stanley remarks on this line in the Choephoroe, to the ancient custom of thrice bidding farewell to the dead, a custom commemorated in several well- known passages which are cited by Stanley there and Spanheim here.
In the Odyssey, ix.
63, Odysseus is recount- ing his repulse from the Thracian coast, with the loss of many of his comrades.
And he says :
-
Then stood we out to sea, full dismally leaving the coast, Glad from the death to flee, yet grieving for comrades lost.
But or ever the keels ran out to the offing, we turned to the shore, THRICE raising the farewell shout to those we should see nevermore, Whom Death in the plain did meet with Ciconian men as they fought.—WAY.
So in Virgil vi. 505 Aeneas, describing to the shade of Deiphobus the honours they had paid to his memory, says :
— Yea, and a vacant mound upon far Rhaetaeum's coast, Built I for thee and THRICE bade loud farewell to thy ghost.—BOWEN."
Mortuis dicisolet Vale !
Vale !
Vale ! " says Servius on Aen. ii. 644. Finally in Theocr. xxiii. 44, a despairing lover beseeches his loved one to come to his grave and THRICE call out, ὦ φίλε κεῖσα.
But though we call them thrice.
says Dionysus, we do not (that is to say, our voice does not) reach them in their graves.1177.
ἐγὼ φράσω]
It is now the turn of Euripides to bring his prologues to the test;
and he does so with the cheer-Dio.
Aye, but he's speaking to the dead, you knave, Who cannot hear us though we call them thrice.
AESCH.
And how do you make your prologues?
EUR.

There will be no vain repetitions, no redundant verbiage there.
In view of the wholesale ruin which awaits his prologues, the self-satisfied confidence with which he introduces them might well be found highly diverting.
1182. ἦν Οἰδἕίπους]
This and line 1187 are the first two lines of the Antigone of Euripides ;
and the bald juxtaposition of their two statements about Oedipus might seem to invite the criticism of Aristophanes.
Euripides himself in the Phoenissae (1595-1611) supplies the arguments, and indeed almost the language, with which Aristophanes demolishes the first line of the Antigone and the ἐγένετο of the second.
We are told by the Scholiast on 53 supra that the Phoenissae preceded the Frogs by a short interval only:
and there is no manner of doubt that Aristophanes was referring, and would be understood by the audience to, be referring, to the language and arguments of the tragic play.
It is only fair, however, to observe that the view taken in the first two lines of the Antigone, whether right or wrong, is by no means specially Euripidean:
the sudden downfall of Oedipus from the height of happiness and prosperity to the lowest depth of adversity was the stock illustration, in ancient times, of the changes and chances of -this mortal life:
and is displayed with great and impressive skill by Sophocles in the Oedipus Tyrannus.
And the closing trochaics in which Sophocles points the contrast between his hero's earlier and later condition, are, strangely enough, trans- ferred almost verbatim by Euripides to the final scene of the Phoenissae.1195.
εὐδαίμων ἄρ' ἦν]
The meaning of this little speech is not quite clear, but in my opinion Dionysus is alluding to the last preceding words of Aeschylus ἐξετύφλωσεν αὑτόν.
"There indeed he was lucky," interprets Dionysus, "if at least he was one of the colleagues of Erasinides."
For had he been blind, he would not have joined the fleet (192 supra);
would not have won the battle of Arginusae;
would not have fallen a victim, as Erasinides did, to the mad- ness of the Athenian people.
I take ἐστρατήγησεν to mean, not (as Bergler and Brunck translate it) si exercitum duxisset, but si strategus fuisset.
This seems to me both the simplest and the most satisfactory interpretation.
But the passage is generally explained quite otherwise.
"
Happy indeed was he:
he only wanted to be a colleague of Erasi- nides to complete such happiness," is Mr. Green's rendering, and Dr. Blaydes takes the same view.
On the other hand, Dr. Merry explains it:
"If Oedipus could be called happy under such a complication of disasters, he would even have been happy if he had been a colleague of Erasinides."
The words εὐδαίμων ἄρ' ἦν recur in Plutus 657, but without throwing any light on the passage before us.
No sooner born, than they exposed the babe, (And that in winter), in an earthen crock, Lest he should grow a man, and slay his father.
Then with both ankles pierced and swoln, he limped Away to Polybus:
still young, he married An ancient crone, and her his mother too.
Then scratched out both his eyes.

ὥστ' ἐναρμάττειν ἄπαν]
Six pro- logues will be brought to the test;
and in each, before the third line, at all events, is concluded, the fatal tag ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν completes both the sense and the metre.
Only one of the six is taken from an extant play, the Iphigenia in Tauris :
it is quite accur- ately cited, and doubtless the remaining five are cited with equal accuracy.
For a fuller discussion of all these minor contests the reader is referred to the Introduction.
1206.
Αἵγυπτας]
In all probability this was the original commencement of the Archelaus, though it had lost its place before the days of the Alexan- drine grammarians.
The Scholiast says :
The commencement of later days has been recovered from various authors,and is thus given by Wagner (Fragm. Trag. Graec.)
Now the legend of Aegyptus and Danaus, as told by Hyginus (Fab, 168), was as follows.
They were brothers, and the former had fifty sons and the latter fifty daughters.
The former, plotting to destroy Danaus and his family, demanded that the fifty daughters should be given to his fifty sons.
Danaus, aware of the plot, fled with his daugh- ters to Argos, whither they were quickly followed by the fifty sons of Aegyptus (and, according to Euripides, by Aegyptus himself).
Danaus finding himself the weaker, was obliged to give his fifty daughters in marriage to their fifty cousins, but counselled them to slay their husbands, which all but Hyper- mnestra did.
The two voyages to Argos are so closely interwoven that Euripides could hardly have commenced one play with an account of the voyage of Danaus, and another with an account of the voyage of Aegyptus.
It is far more probable that he originally commenced the Archelaus with an account of the voyage of Aegyptus, which was sub- sequently discarded either by himself or, as Fritzsche thinks, by the younger Euripides, in favour of the earlier voyage of Danaus.
The change could not how- ever have been occasioned, as Fritzsche and others contend, by the satire of Aristophanes, since the ἐλθὼν ἐς 'Αργος of the later prologue is just as amenableAs ancient legends mostly tell the tale, Touching at Argos AESCH.

ληκύθιαν ἀπώλεσεν]
The seven syllables displaced by these two words (and of course κωδάριον ἀπώλεσεν or θυλάκιον ἀπώλεσεν would have had the same effect) form a trochaic dimeter catalectic
And the havoc which the ληκύθιον wrought amongst the Euripidean prologues made such an impression upon the popular mind that this metre ever thereafter went by the name of the Euripidean or the Lecythian.
Δίμετρ
ον καταληκτικὰν, says Hephaestion (chap. 6) in his enumera- tion of trochaic metres, τὸκαλαύμενον Εὐριπίδειαν ἦ ληκύθιαν.
And the Scholiast there explains that it acquired those names δι ' Αριστοφάνην σκώπτοντα TO μέτραν TO ἑφθημιμερὲς Εὐριπίδαυ in he present passages.
The Scholiast indeed suggests another reason, which is plainly untenable.
1211.
Διάνυσος]
This, the Scholiast tells us, is the commencement of the Hypsipyle, a play to which reference is elsewhere made in the Frogs.
In the tragedy the third line ran πηδᾷ χαρεύων παρθένοις σὺν Δελφίσιν.1214.
αἵμαι πεπλήγμεθ']
The two famous death cries of Agamemnon, ὥμοι πέπληγ- μαι and ὥμοι μάλ' αὖθις (Aesch. Ag. 1343, 1345), which were repeated by his murder- ess in Sophocles (Electra 1415,1416), and are imitated by the sycophant in Plutus 934, 935, are here blended together.
Dionysus employs the plural πεπλήγμεθ' because, apart from merely metrical reasons, he is here, as in 1228 infra, identifying himself for the moment with the cause and the prologues of Euripides.
There is no allusion, as some have fancied, to the fact that, if the preceding three lines are to be taken literally, it is Dionysus himself who has lost his ληκύθιαν.
The stage Dionysus, both here and in the Iacchus scene above, is far too deeply engrossed in his stage business to take heed of any allusion to himself in any other than his stage character.
1217.
οὐκἕστινὅστις]
Euripides, as ifrealizing that his historical prologues were peculiarly obnoxious to the ληκύθιον test, chooses for his third example a prologue of an entirely different char- acter.
This is the commencement of his Stheneboea, the third line being ἢ δυσγενὴς ὢν πλουσίαν ἀροῖ πλάκα.
It consists of a double apophthegm like the commencement of the Heracleidae, which itself, if adduced, would have fallen a victim to the same test.
1225.
Σιδώνιόν ποτ᾽]
The philosophic exordium having fared no better than its predecessors, Euripides now reverts to the more familiar type, and recites as his fourth example the commence- ment of the'Phrixus, the second line in the original being Ἀγήνορ
ος παῖς ἵκετ᾽ ἐς Θήβης πέδον.
The Scholiast calls the play the second Phrixns, as if either there were two plays of that name, as in the case of the Thesmophoriazusae and the Plutus of Aristophanes, or a revised edition (so to say) of the original drama, as in the case of the Clouds.

criticism of Aristophanes, are obliged to alter the TOO δευτέρου φρίξου of the Scholiast into τοῦ πρώτου φρίξου.
But Fritzsche’s theory has little to recom- mend it:
and there seems no doubt that the line before us was recognized as the final commencement of the Phrixus.
In [Plutarch's]
Lives of the Ten Orators we are told that Isocrates, when dying, recited three lines of Euripides, all obviously introductory lines:
and lines which could hardly have been uttered without- some reminiscence of the present passage.1229.
ἐγὼ πρίωμαι τῷδ’ ;
]
Except that πρίωμαι is substituted for σιωπῶ, this line is identical with 1134 supra.
There Aeschylus, as here Euripides, is repudi- ating with indignation the pacific coun- sels of Dionysus.
1232.
Πέλοψ]
This is the commence- ment of the still extant Iphigenia in Tauris.
The speaker is Iphigenia her- self, and she ends the second line with Οἰνομάου γαμεῖ κόρην.vero notionem medii ἀποδίδοσθαι pro- priam esse confirmo ;
ac proinde rescribi oportere ἀπόδου πάσῃ τέχνῃ.”—Dawes.
And his alteration is accepted by several editors.
But all this proceeds on the assumption that the appeal is addressed to Aeschylus, whereas it seems clear that it is addressed to Euripides.
The expression, πάσῃ τέχνῃ "by all means in.
your power,” "if you possibly can," shows that the proposal was of the utmost importance to the persou ad- dressed :
whilst the words ἔτι καὶ νῦν imply that he has already missed an opportunity or displayed some reluct- ance to grasp it.
Neither of these considerations applies to Aeschylus:
both apply to Euripides.
Aeschylus would not be anxious to part with his victorious weapon:
to purchase it seems the only chance left to Euripides of saving his unfortunate prologues.
Aeschylus has not been asked, and therefore has not refused, to sell;
Euripides has been asked, and has refused, to buy.
And Dr. Blaydes, who takes the same view, observes that the response comes not from Aeschylus, but from Euripides.
I agree with him and Fritzsche that ἀπόδος is here used, as supra 270, in its ordinary signification, Pay him the price.
The epithets καλήν τε κἀγαθὴν are applied to the Aeschylean weapon because its owner is καλὸς κἀγαθός.1238.
Οἰνεύς ποτ᾽ ἐκ γῆς]
This line, the Scholiast tells us, comes from, but does not commence, the prologue of the Meleager, t he first line being kαλυδὼν μὲν ἥδε γαῖα, Πελοπίας χθονός.

Trag. Graec.) is as follows-It may be that the lines in the text once formed the commencement of the Meleager, though when altered, or by whom, or for what reason it is impossible

Zeus, as by Truth's own voice the tale is told,to say :
but they are admittedly a part of its prologue ;
and perhaps Euripides was entitled to bring any part, and not merely the commencement, of a pro- logue to the test.
The Scholiast com- pletes the second line with the words αὐκ ἔθυσεν ᾽Αρτέμιδι, but a tragic senarius could not end with a tribrach, and many suggestions have been made to set the metre right.
Person proposed οὐκ ἔθυσε παρθένῳ, Paley οὐκ ἔθυσε τῇ θεᾴ, whilst Bergk, relying on a gloss of Hesychius καθωσίωσε* κατέθυσε, Εὐριπίδης Μελεάγρῳ, supposed that Artemis her- self was the prologist, and would read οὐ καθωσίωσ᾽ ἐμοί.
The story of the king's neglect of Artemis, and of her revenge by sending the Calydonian boar, which was ultimately slain by Meleager, is told by Phoenix in the ninth Iliad.1243.
ἔασον, ὦ τᾶν]
Euripides is getting into a state of high excitement and irritability, and cannot brook any jest- ing or interruption.
1244.
Zεὺς, ὡς λέλεκται]
This line occurred twice in the plays of Euripides :
(1)
It is here quoted, as the Scholiast remarks, as the commencement of the Melanippe Sapiens, where it was followed by the words ῞Ελλην᾽ ἔτικτε.
Plutarch (Eroticus, xiii) makes one of his char- acters say ἀκούεις δὲ δήπου τὸν Εὐριπίδην, ὡς ἀθορυβήθη ποιησάμενος ἀρχὴν τῆς Μελαν- ίππης ἐκείνης See Wagner, Melanippe, Fragm.
i.
Here therefore, as in the case of the Phrixus, supra 1225, we have Aristophanes citing the revised play.
(2) It was also found in the Peirithous, where Heracles, ex- plaining to Aeacus his parentage and his country, says,— Wagner, Peirithous, Fragm.

Just as he has been attempting to convict his rival's pro- logues of tautology, so he is now going to convict his rival's lays of tautometry.
μέλος properly means a song, a combina- tion of words, metre, and music;
τὸ μέλος ἐκ τριῶν ἐστὶ συγκείμενον, λόγου τε καὶ ἁρμονίας καὶ ῥυθμοῦ. Plato, Rep. iii. 398 C.
But when a μέλος is regarded in special relation to one of these three ingredients, it is frequently identified with that particular ingredient and contrasted with the others.
And so, whilst Plato elsewhere contrasts μέλος with ῥυθμὸς (which, of course, includes metre :
τὰ yap μάτρα, ὅτι μόρια τῶν pv6- μω̃ν ἐστι, φανερόν.—Aristotle, Poetics, 4), Hesychius, on the other hand, gives ῥυθμὸς as the equivalent of peXos.

here the μέλος is specially regarded from a metrical point of view.
When Euripides says that Aeschylus is a poor μελοποιὸς, making all his μέλη alike, he means that they all partake of the same metre.
When, infra 1262, he promises to cut down all the μέλη of Aeschylus to one, he means to one metre.1251.
TL ποτε κ.τ.λ.]
Short as this little glyconic chorus is, it apparently con- sists of two versions of the same lyric, one version probably belonging to the original, and the other to the revised comedy.
We may conjecture that the first six lines constitute one version, from τί ποτε to νυνί.
And that the other consisted of the first line τί ποτε πρῦγμα γενήσεται, and the last four, from θαυ- μάζω to αὐταῦ :
though probably some- thing would be changed in combining the two.1262.
εἰς ἅν]
Aeschylus, the most Homeric of poets, would naturally have the swing of the Homeric hexameter for ever vibrating in his mind;
and Euripides is about to show that his various metres, however they commence, are constantly gliding into that heroic metre.
For this purpose he takes a model line of twelve syllables | (an ordinary hexa- meter with the first foot and all but thelast syllable of the second foot cut off), and applies it as a standard measure to various verses cited from the plays of Aeschylus.
This standard measure may be illustrated from the first verse of the Odyssey, ἄνδρα μαι ἔννε||πε, Μοῦσα, πολύ- τροπον, ôς μάλα πολλά.
Euripides gives it in the form ἰὴ, κάπαν, αὐ πελάθεις ἐπ’ ἀρωγάν ;
Dionysus proposes to take some counters, and reckon the number of lines cut down to this measure.
Two of them, the second and the fifth, are pure heroics;
the three others com- mence differently:
but however they commence, they are sure to slip into just so much of the heroic metre as corresponds to the twelve syllables ἰὴ, κάπαν, αὐ πελάθεις ἐπ’ ἀρωγάν ;
The por- tion of each line corresponding to the standard, and the standard itself, are in the translation distinguished by italics.
Between 1263 and 1264.
Διαύλιον. direction is not one sentence, as Brunck translates it, Tibicen diaulium accinit.
Διαύλιαν means that there is an interval during which nothing is heard but the αὐλάς :
πρασαυλεȋ, that the musician con. tinues to accompany the recitative of Euripides.
The accompaniment doubt- less went on to the end of 1277.1264.
Φθιῶτ’ Ἀχιλευ̑
The first line to be experimented upon is taken, the Scholiast tells us, from the Myrmidons of Aeschylus ;
cf. supra 992.
Its last twelve syllables, -ιλευ̑ τί ποτ’ ἀνδροδάïκτον ἀκαύων, will be found in exact accord with the standard ἰὴ, κάπον, αὐ πελάθεις in ἀρωγάν ;
or, to give the other ex- ample mentioned above, -πε Μαυ̑σα παλύτροπον ᾶς μάλα πολλά.
The form Ἀχιλευ̑ is read in all the older editions, but Ἀχιλλευ̑ is generally found in the MSS.
and recent editors have accord- ingly introduced it into the text, not observing that by so doing they are rendering the line unsuitable for the purpose for which it is quoted.
For the standard commences with a short syllable, as if the second foot of the hexameter (like ἔννεπε in the first lineDio.
And I, I'll take some pebbles, and keep count.

and every line with which the standard is repeated must also commence with a short syllable.
See the note on 1282 infra.
It is quite possible that in the Myrmidons the form was Ἀχιλλευ̑, but here it is necessarily Ἀχιλευ̑.1265.
ἰὴ, κόπαν]
The standard, though applied to test each line in succession, forms a grammatical sequence to the first line only, which apparently it followed in the play of the Myrmidons.
And just as Aeschylus there spoke of κάπον ἀνδροδάïκτον, a man-splitting blow, so in Choeph.
845 (to which Mitchell refers) he spoke of κοπάνων ἀνδροδαΐκτων, man-splitting choppers.
—Scholiast.
Cyllene was, of course, the reputed birthplace of Hermes, who was the special patron and god of Arcady, and to whom the Arcadians traced back their origin.
In the eighth Aeneid Aeneas, addressing the Arcadian colony in Italy, says :
— Vobis Mercurius pater est, quern Candida Maia Cyllenae gelido conceptum vertice fudit.1268.
δύα σοὶ κάπω]
As each successive line is brought within the ἰὴ κόπαν metre, Dionysus reckons it a κόπος or blow for Aeschylus :
and he has the impertinence to express his opinion, both here and 1272 infra, in words which, so far as they go, are themselves in the incri- minated metre.
δης δὲ ἐξ ’Ιφιγενείας.—Scholiast.
The play from which the line was taken must have perished before these doubts arose.
1273.
εὐΦαμει̑τε] ’Εξ ‛Ιερειω̑ν Αἰσχύλου. —Scholiast.
These "Priestesses" doubt- less formed the Chorus of the play.
And since we know, from the Scholiast on Pindar, Pyth. iv.
104, that the name μέλισσα was freely given to any priestess, we may well believe that the μελισσ
ο- νάμοι, who appear to have been inferior ministers in the Temple of Artemis, were officers in attendance on these priestesses, and from that duty derived their name.
As to the special con- nexion of the bee with the worship of the Ephesian Artemis, see Müller's Dorians, ii.
9. 8. Here the μέλισσαι seem to have been talking of matters which they did not desire their atten- dants to overhear, and are now warning each other of the approach of the latter.

κύριάς εἰμι]
This is line 104 of the Agamemnon.

ος must signify "the mighty sign from heaven" rather than the confidence by that sign engendered."
It is of the sign, and not of the confidence, that the speaker proceeds to tell.
Κύριός εἰμι means it is in my power. "

κύρι

This is a repeti- tion of the first line of the Clouds, except that for νυκτω̑ν there, we have κόπων here.
On βαύλομαι, in the next line, the Scholiast remarks λείπει TO ἀπελθει̑ν.1281.
έτέραν στάσιν μελω̑ν]
Another batch of melodies.
The Scholiast, ab- surdly enough, would connect the expression with στάσιμα μέλη, and all the commentators have fallen, unresist- ingly, into the very obvious pit which he has digged before them.
Στάσις merely means a group, a by no means unfre- quent signification of the word.

for the accompaniment of the lyre.
Not that, in Aeschylus, there was any differ- ence in this respect between the first and second batches.
Indeed, two lines in the second batch, 1285 and 1289, are taken not only from the same chorus, but even from the very same strophe as one line, 1276, in the first batch ;
see the following note.
But here, in this Aristophanic contest, Euripides, who had recited the first batch to the accom- paniment of the αὐλὸς (see the stage direction above), is about to recite the second batch to the accompaniment of the κιθάρα, the thrumming on which will be represented by the imitative word Φλαττόθρατ.
And as he is dealing with the employment of Homeric metres in the lyrics of tragedy, there is doubt- less an allusion to those κιθαρω̨δικοι̑ς νόμοις in which Terpander had long before set Homer to music.
See Plutarch de Musica, iii.
In this second batch, as the lines are, by the express direction of Dionysus, no longer to be referred to the ἰὴ κόπον standard, the first of the twelve syllables may be either long or short;
in other words, the section may come from a hexameter which has a spondee for the second foot, as well as from one which has a dactyl there.
See the note on 1264 supra.1285.
ὅπως ’Αχαιω̑ν]
This is from Agamemnon 108, 109:
and 1289 infra is from Agamemnon 111, 112.
In the tragic chorus the lines run :

ΣΦίγγα]
This line is taken from the Sphinx of Aeschylus, the satyric drama in the tetralogy of which the Septem contra Thebas formed a part.
The four plays were the Laius, the Oedipus, the Septem, and the Sphinx.
See the argument to the Septem, pub- lished by Franz in 1848, and quoted by Wagner in his introduction to the Frag- ments of the Laius.1291.
κυρει̑ν] ’Επιτυχει̑ν. — Scholiast.
Giving him as a booty (κύρμα) to the vehement air-ranging hounds, that is, to the vultures.
We are not told from what tragedy this line is taken, for the gloss καὶ του̑τα ἐξ ' Ayaμέμνονος no doubt belongs to the preceding quotation.
Dindorf and Fritzsche refer it to the Sphinx, I know not why.
More prob- ably it is borrowed from the Myrmidons or the Phrygians, and alludes to the fate denounced against Patroclus or —Scholiast.
The “Thracian Women” is supposed to have been the second piece of a trilogy by Aeschylus on the death of Aias.
The line was probably inserted here by some ancient scholar, who was struck by the quaintness of expression, and did not understand the point of the Euripidean criticism.
If genuine, it must be is final burst of triumph on the part of Euripides, intended to produce a comic effect by its very irrelevance to the speaker's argument.

From Marathon, or Where picked you up these cable-twister's strains ?
AESCH.
From noblest source for noblest ends I brought them, Unwilling in the Muses' holy field
The self-same flowers as Phrynichus to cull.
But he from all things rotten draws his lays,what follows that by TO Φλαττόθρατ in this line we are to understand not merely the thrumming on the lyre, but the whole body of Aeschylean verse which Euripides has been reciting to the music of the lyre.
These verses he calls ἱμονιοστρόΦου μέλη, meaning, I take it, not verses which the rope-twister sings, but verses as lengthy as the ropes which he makes.
They are so spun out, they .must surely be the work of a ropemaker.
Where then did Aeschylus find these rope-twister's lines ?
Did he bring them from Marathon, or whence, ἐκ Μαραθω̑νος ἢ πόθεν ?
If the Scholiast's statement as to the Φλέως is correct, we may con- elude that the Φλέως of Marathon was employed, like hemp, in the manu- facture of ropes.
But however this may be, the words ἐκ Μαραθω̑νος are undoubtedly intended as a direct com- pliment to the old Μαραθωνομάχης, who took more pride, as his self-composed epitaph shows, in his prowess on that memorable day, than in all his triumphs as the greatest of Atheuian poets.1298.
ἐς TO καλὸν ἐκ του̑ καλου̑]
From nobleness to nobleness, just as we say, in religious phraseology, from strength to strength, or, from grace to grace.
He means, of course, from the epic of Homer to the Athenian drama.
Of Phrynichus, with his mellifluous songs, and dances numberless as the waves of ocean, we have already heard iu the Wasps, the Birds, and supra 910.
Aeschylus was not long content to follow in the steps of his illustrious predecessor;
he soon struck out a new line for himself, infusing into Athenian tragedy the sublime and heroical spirit of the Homeric epos.
Φέρει πορνιδίων, in which, though but three words, there are almost “a score of faults."
The μὲν is entirely out of place ;
Φέρει requires some object, such as μέλη, to be expressed;
the second syllable of πορνιδίων is short:
nor is the word itself suitable, since Aeschylus is describing not the persons from whom, but the garbage from which, the lyrics of Euripides were derived.
Person pro- posed πορνιδίων μέλη Φέρει, which some have accepted, but which is a rather violent change, and leaves the last objection untouched.
μελοΦορει̑, a verb formed like μελοποιει̑, does not seem an impossible source for μὲν Φέρει, whilst πορνω̩δικὰ μέλη, songs of the harlotry kind (like παρω̨δικὰ μέλη, songs of a burlesque character), gives the sense which the passage requires.
The lyric inspiration of Aeschylus was derived from the Homeric poems :
but whence comes the lyric inspiration of Euripides ?
It is drawn, his opponent tells us, from every sort of harlotry-melody, the catches of Meletus, &c.
The σκόλια of Meletus,the tragic poet who shortly after- wards acquired an unenviable notoriety as one of the accusers of Socrates (Atb. xii. 75 ;
Plato, Apol. chap. 10), are not elsewhere mentioned:
but as his erotic poems were (according to Dobree's certain emendation of a fragment of the Antilais of Epicrates.—Meineke, Corn. Fragm. iii. 367) classed with those of Sappho and the like, we may readily believe that they were not unfairly described as πορνω̨δικὰ μέλη.
Nor was such an appellation less suited to the Καρικὰ αὐλήματα, if we may judge by their connexion with a μέλος ’Ιωνικὸν in a fragment of Plato Comicus preserved by Athenaeus at the commencement of Book xv.
There a speaker is describing a banquet, much as Bdelycleon describes it in the Wasps.
"The tables are carried out,” he says, "the guests are wearing their chaplets The Scholiast, indeed, and some commentators take the Καρικὰ αὐλήματα toFrom Carian flutings, catches of Meletus, Dance-music, dirges.

Halcyons, who by the ever-ripplingbe the doleful strains, mentioned by many ancient authors, which the Carians were accustomed, as hired mourners, to play on the αὐλὸς at funerals :
but this seems less likely in itself, and strains such as these would fall under the following word θρήνων.
χορειω̑ν is dance-music.1305.
rots ὀστράκοις]
Mitchell refers a noise is heard behind the scenes as of a person rattling shells together.

δευ̑ρο]
An actor enters, per- sonating a flaunting harlot, and clash- ing oyster-shells together.
Aeschylus hails him as the Muse of Euripides.1308.
ἐλεσβίαζεν]
The word λεσβιάζειν means to practise the filthiest tricks of harlotry:
and Dionysus, seeing a miser- able wanton introduced as Euripides's Muse, exclaims, "You don't mean to say that the Muse herself (αἰτὴ, not as usually read, αὔτη) has played the harlot!
No, that I cannot believe."
The lyrics of Aeschylus have been criticized as perpetually falling into one cadence, the long roll of the Homeric hexameter.
The lyrics of Euripides are now to be criticized as corrupting the noble simplicity of the ancient metres, by the introduction of affected novelties, and dainty little devices, like the tricks of a harlot, ἀνὰ TO δωδεκαμήχονον Κυρήνης, as Aeschylus says below.
To prove his case he brings forward seven passages, one of which is accurately cited from an extant play, and the others are doubtless taken with no less accuracy from plays long since perished.
We know so little about the lyrical niceties of Athenian tragedy that it is impos- sible to lay one's finger with anything like certainty on the particular innova- tions to which objection is taken, but a brief discussion of the subject will be found in the Introduction.
It is of course impossible in the translation to show the supposed innovations, or even the metres which they are supposed to have corrupted.1309-12.
ἀλκυόνες... δρ
οσιζόμεναι]
This first passage, the Scholiast informs us, is taken from the Iphigenia in Aulis.
It is not found in the extant play, which indeed was not exhibited at the date of the Frogs, though it may havebeen published before.
But all agree that the play has not come down to us as it left its author's hands.
Boeckh indeed (Graec. Trag. Princ.) contended that there were two plays of this name:
one, now lost, by the great tragedian;
and the extant play, the work of Euripides the younger.
But Bp. Monk, in the dissertation appended to his edition of the play, convincingly proves that ours is the original play, but that much has perished and much has been interpolated.
Bergler observes that the halcyon is mentioned in the Iph. in Tauris (1089), but there is no simi- larity between that passage and the lines here quoted.
Here there seem to be two metrical blots, as Aristophanes regards them.
The first line is paeonic, and after the two paeons, — ◡◡◡ I — ◡◡◡, instead of the expected cretic, — ◡, Euripides surprises his hearers with an iambic dipody (-νάοις θαλάσσ-).
The fourth line is a choriambic dimeter, where, in place of the iambic dipody with which it usually begins, Euripides substitutes two tribrachs, ῥανίσι χρόα δροσ-.
Indeed the resolution of one long syllable into two short ones is one of the special devices with which he is supposed to have tickled the ears of his audience.1313-5. a? θ’ . . . πηνίσματα]
Whence the address to the spiders, which forms the second test-passage, is taken we do not know.
Probably from some such play as the Danae, where we may well imagine the imprisoned princess, like Robert the Bruce in Scottish history, watching these patient and tireless workers.
Here the "blot" is in the third line, which, except that there is but one paeon instead of two, is identical with the first line of the first passage.
Waves of the sea are babbling, Dewing your plumes with the drops that fall From wings in the salt spray dabbling.
Spiders, ever with twir-r-r-r-r-rling fingers Weaving the warp and the woof, Little, brittle, network, fretwork, Under the coigns of the roof.
The minstrel shuttled care.
Where in the front of the dark-prowed ships Yarely the flute-loving dolphin skips.
Races here and oracles there.
And the joy of the young vines smiling, And the tendril of grapes, care-beguiling.1316.
κερκίδος ... μελέτας]
The third passage, we are told, is borrowed from the Melehger, a play quoted supra 1238 and infra 1402.
The blot here is similar to that in the fourth line of the first passage :
the first iamb of a choriambic dimeter being changed into a dactyl, κερκίδος.1317, 1318. ἵν’ ὁ...
κυανεμβόλοις]
This fourth passage is the only quotation from an existing play, the Electra of Euripides.
It is of course cited quite correctly as far as it goes (otherwise the criticism would be pointless), but the full passage in the original is :
—
Here the blot is obvious.
These are gly- conic lines, which should properly consist of a disyllabic base, a choriamb, and an iamb.
The second line is a flawless glyconic.
In the first line the base consists of three syllables.1319.
μαντει̑α καὶ σταδίους]
We are not told whence this fifth passage is taken.
This again is a choriambic dimeter, but μαντει̑α stands for an iambic dipody, which has lost its last syllable.
The absence of the syllable constitutes the blot in this passage.
ἀμπέλου οἰνάνθη λέγεται.-Scholiast.
It is clear that the Scholiast has no idea whence this sixth passage is quoted.
He is merely referring to a totallydissimilar passage in which the word οἰνάνθη occurs.
The second line con- tains exactly the same blot as the fourth line of the first passage, the iambic dipody being changed into two tribrachs.
1322.
περίβλλ’ ... ὠλένας] ’Εξ ‛γψι πύλης.—Scholiast.
The blot here con- sists in making an anapaest the base of a glyconic line.
1323.
ὁρα̜̑ς τὸν πόδα τόνδ’ ;
]
Do you see this foot ?
asks Aeschylus, referring to the anapaestic base of the preceding glyconic line.
In the energy of his scorn and indignation he advances his own foot;
and Dionysus, speaking of the human, and not of the metrical, foot, replies, Yes, I see it well enough.
Well then, says Aeschylus, advancing his other foot, do you see this too ?
Yes, replies Dionysus, I see that too.
In the first line Aeschylus is quite serious, and only Dionysus is jesting.
In the second line they are both playing the fool.1327.
ἀνὰ τὸ δωδεκαμήχανον]
This is borrowed from the Hypsipyle of Euri- pides, though it is doubtful whether the phrase there was ἀνὰ τὸ δωδεκαμήχονον ἄντρ
ον, referring to the cave of the ξανθοδέρκης ὑπέροπλος δρακων (Bacchy- lides, ix. 12, ed. Kenyon), which slew the infant charge of Hypsipyle, or ἀνὰ to δωδκεκαμήχανον ἄστρον, referring to the course of the sun through the twelve signs of the zodiac.

See the note on Wasps 1501.1331.
ὦ Νυκτός]
Aeschylus now pro- ceeds to improvise a monody, or lyrical monologue, in the style, and to a great extent in the very words, of Euripides.
It is intended as a satire on the trivial incidents around which Euripides was accustomed to throw the grace and dignity of tragic diction.
A poor spin- ning-girl has a bad dream, a vision of the night so threatening and so terrible, that it is plainly the forerunner of some tremendous catastrophe.
She begins by appealing to Night about her dream, 0 black-litten darkness of Night!
The epithet κελαινοΦαὴς contains the same idea as Milton's “darkness visible," which was the sole illumination of hell.
The spinning-girl's appeal may recall the monody in Hecuba 67-99, but it is going too far to say, as some even before the time of the Scholiast had said, that Aristophanes is specially imitating or referring to that or any other particular monody.
̓́ΟρΦνα, says Mitchell, is "a word not found in Aeschylus or Sophocles, but of frequent occurrence in Euripides."
It is found more than a dozen times in his extant tragedies.
1333.
πρόπολον], Minister or messenger of Hades.
The description proceeds in a sort of crescendo.1338.
ἀλλά μοι, ἀμΦιπολοι]
Aroused from her sleep the dreamer gives herself the airs of a tragedy queen, a Clytae- mnestra or a Hecabe, commanding her ladies in waiting, ἀμΦίπολοι, to fill their pitchers with water from the running stream, and heat it well, that so she may purge away the evil dream.
The custom of washing away the ill-omened dream with water from sea or river is of course well known, and many instances are collected by the commentators.
In Silius Italicus, viii. 125 (to which Kuster refers) Anna seems to have bathed her whole person in the running water, "vivo purgor in amni."
In Aesch.Persae 203 (to which Bergler refers) Atossa seems to have washed her hands only in the bright-welling fountain :
whilst in Apollonius Rhodius, iv. 671 (to which Brunck refers) Circe washed her hair and her raiment in the sea. "
Heating " the water is quite alien to the nature of these ceremonial ablutions :
but θέρμετέ θ’ ὕδωρ is a Homeric phrase, ἀμΦὶ δέ οἱ πυρὶ χαλκὸν ἰήνατε, θέρμετε δ’ ὕδωρ, and possibly is only employed here for the purpose of rounding off so important a commission with epic, or shall we say, Aeschylean stateliness ;
for the metre is the old ἰὴ κόπον οὐ πελάθεις in ἀρωγάν.
The Scholiast says Tropo τὰ etc τω̑ν Εὐ- μενίδων, which is probably only an irrelevant reference to Aesch.
Eum. 429 ἀΦιερώμεθα ῥυτοι̑ς πόροις ;

All at once she sees what the dream portended, and knows that the blow has fallen.
Whilst she was toiling at her spinning-wheel within, that vile girl Glyce has absconded with her cock.
This, this is the momen- tous event foreshadowed by the θει̑ον ἄνειραν.
She bewails her loss with Euripidean reduplications (δάκρυα, δά- κρυα, ἔβαλον, ἔβαλον), and with those long-drawn musical trills of which we have heard before, supra 1314.
The πόντιος δαίμων is Poseidon, who is so described by Euripides in Rhesus 240.
She calls to all the dwellers in the house ξυνοίκους her housemates) to come and behold for themselves the porten- tous outcome of her dream.
1344.
Γλύκη]
She has carried away my coch:
she is off, is Glyce.
Glyce was apparently a neighbour (γυνή τις ἐκ γειτάνων.—Scholiast) who had come to the spinning-girl's house.
The exceed- ing neatness of the sentence Φραύδη Γλύκη suggests a reminiscence of some lost passage of Euripides.
1345.
ὦ Μανια, ξύλλαβε] 0 Mania, lend a hand.
The Scholiast absurdly inter- prets Μανία madness :
but of course it is the name of a woman, probably another spinning-girl.

Athenaeus, xiii, chap. 41.
The association of a poor girl with the mountain-born Nymphs is quite in the spirit of the caricature.1351.
ἀνέπτατ’ ἐς αἰθέρα]
This " upward flight into aether " is hardly consistent with Glyce's theft;
but the speaker disregards the inconsistency, for the sake of introducing a phrase which, as indeed Mitchell has already observed, is a special favourite of Euripides. "
Shall I soar to the halls above, αἰθέρ’ ἀμπτάμενος ;
" inquires Polymestorin Hec. 1100;
"Whither shall I fly," asks the Phrygian in Orestes 1376, " πολιόν αἰθέρ’ ἀμπτάμενος ἢ πόντον ;
""Honour no longer abides in Hellas," declare the Chorus in Medea 440, " αἰθερία 8' ἀνέπτα." " I fear," says Iphigenia, in Tauris 843, " I fear that my brother will elude me, πρὸς α̠ἰθέρα ἀμπτάμενος." "0 that I could soar up into the moist aether, ἀν’ ὐγρὸν ἀμπταίην αἰθέρα," wails Creusa in Ion 796.1353. ἄχε’ ἄχεα]
Reduplications of this kind are everywhere found in Euripides :
and very frequently, as in the present passage, the word repeated is a tri- brach ;
ἄτεκνον, ἄτεκνον, ἔλαβεν, ἔλαβεν, Ion 790.1356.

The Κρῆτες was a tragedy which John Malelas (p. 106) described as written 'repi τῆς Πασιφἀης.
See Bentley (Epistle to Mill) on the passage.
And it seems probable, as Wagner suggests, that these lines are taken from Pasiphae's monody.
See the note on 849 supra.
Some go so far as to con- sider the whole monody a parody of Pasi- phae's :

Hecate, a.,;
connectedwith the moon, is always described as carrying lights in her hands.
She comes to Demeter in the Homeric Hymn (52), αέλας ἐν χείρεσσιν ἔχουσα, and Φωσφόρ
ος became her most familiar epithet.
The words διπύρ
ους ἀνέχουσα λαμπάδας are rightly rendered by Kuster utraque manu tenens facem.
Both Ar- temis and Hecate were specially invoked by women :
νὴ τὴν Αρτεμιν, νὴ τὴν 'Εκάτην τὴν Φωσφόρον, νὴ τἠν Φωσφόρον, are amongst their most ordinary oaths in Aristophanes.1364.

So ends the battle of the choral melodies:
and we come to the last stage of the poetic contest, the question which poet wrote the weightier verses.1370.
ἐπίπονοι]
Whilst the Chorus are singing this little ode, a large balance is brought out and placed upon the stage.
Something of the kind must have been done in the Ψυχοστασία of Aeschylus:
and it is noticeable that it is Aeschylus who proposes it here.
The ode itself is composed of trochaic dimeters, very similar to the strophe and antistrophe, infra 1482-1499, but without the catalectic line there inter- posed after the fourth line :
and some editors have marked a lacuna between 1373 and 1374:

antistrophe, and there is no reason why it should exactly correspond with any- thing.1374. μὰ τόν]
The name of the deity is omitted, as in the passage of Plato (Gorgias, chap. 22) to which the Scholiast Spanheim refers to the passage in which Philo Judaeus, discoursing on the Third Commandment, commends those who employ this elliptical expression, λέ- γοντες τοσοῦτον μόνον, νὴ τὸν, ἢ μὰ TOV. —ii. 271, ed. Mang.
Such an ellipsis is very common with us, as in our phrase "Bless you" or the reverse:
and our vulgar exclamation "
My gracious ! "1378. ἴθι νυν]
The weighing competi- tion which ensues was of course a fore- gone conclusion in favour of Aeschylus, who has already been described as πυργώσας ῥήματα αεμνὰ, and than whom no poet ever composed more dignified and weighty verse ;
whilst Euripides has been boasting that he had relieved tragedy of its heavy weight, τὸ βάρος ἀφεȋλ
ον, supra 941.
The competition, however, is turned into a mere farce by the device of weighing the competing lines in scales.1379. λαβομένω] Cf. λάβεσθε τοίνυν αὖθις, infra 1390.
Each was to hold his scale steady as he spoke his line into it, so as to prevent the scales rising or falling until Dionysus gave the signal.
To speak a line into the scale is treated as tantamount to laying the line bodily upon it.
The reply ἐχόμεθα means that each is holding his scale in the manner prescribed.1382.
εἴθ᾽ ὤφελ᾽ Ἀργοῦς]
The first line brought forward in the competition is likewise the only one quoted from a, still extant drama.
It is the opening line of the Medea.
Aeschylus responds with a line from his Philoctetes.
For each of the three great tragedians wrote a tragedy of that name, though only the Philoctetes of Sophocles has sur- vived.1386.
ἐριοπωλικῶς]
Just as a tricky chapman, selling his wool by weight, might moisten the wool to make it weigh the heavier, so Aeschylus, says Dionysus, increased the weight of his verse, by infusing a whole river into it.1390.

Death loves not gifts , alone amongst the gods.
The worship of Peitho seems to have been introduced into Athens by Theseus when he had' made all the people of Attica Athenian citizens.
In honour of that event he erected, Pausanias tells us (i. 22. 3), a temple for the conjoint worship of Peitho and Aphrodite Pan- demus ;
Peitho representing the persua- sion whereby he had effected the change, and Aphrodite Pandemus (quite different from the Aphrodite who bore that ap- pellation in later times) signifying that now "the heart of the people beat with one desire."
That the worship of Peitho was still the subject of an annual cele- bration we know from Isocrates, who, in his speech on the ἀντίδοσις, 266, argues that they who rail at the art of rhetoric are speaking lightly of the gods, τὴν μὲν1392.
μόνος θεῶν]
Aeschylus gives a line from his Niobe, frequently cited by the ancient grammarians.
Stobaeus (Anth. 118.
1) preserves the passage in which it occurs :
—
In the second line, ἄνοις is Dobree's felicitous emendation of the MS.
ναοȋς.
The fourth line, attesting the superiority of θάνατος to Πειθὼ, seems, as has oftenbeen remarked, very apposite to the present competition.
The passage itself, by whomsoever spoken, is intended to illustrate the hopeless case of Niobe, whom Death had bereft of her children.
See the note on 912 supra.
All other gods might be propitiated by gifts or won over by prayers.
δῶρα θεοὺς πείθει, δῶρ᾽ αἰδοίους βασιλῆας (Hesiod, as cited by Plato, Republic, iii. 390 E).
Death alone receives no gifts and yields to no supplication.1400.
βέβληκ᾽ Ἀχιλλεύς]
Euripides cannot at the moment call to mind any great and weighty line that he has ever written ;
and Dionysus maliciously ad- vises him to resort to that notable scene in his Telephus, which had represented the Achaean heroes playing at dice, but which had been so unmercifully handled by the Athenian wits for its lack of tragic dignity, that the poet himself, though, sufficiently enured (one would suppose) to raillery of that sort, felt the necessity of suppressing it in the revised edition of the play.
The Scholiasts, unable to find the line in the Euripides of their own day, were in doubt whether it originally came from the Telephus, the Iphigenia in Aulis, or the Philo- ctetes, or whether it was not a mere concoction of Aristophanes himself.
However, as was long ago pointed out by Kuster, the real facts of the case are preserved by Eustathius (on Iliad, xvi. 742, and Odyssey, i. 107). "
It will not be out of place," says he (I give a con- densed translation of the learned arch- bishop's narrative), "to mention here that the ancients used three dice, τρισὶ κύβοις ἐχρῶντο, and not, as is now the custom, only two.
Hence the proverbial expression in relation to people who hazard everything, ἤ τρὶς ε̃ξ, ἤ τρεȋςDio.

He threw two chariots and two corpses in;
κύβους, a proverb drawn from the highest throw on the dice, which is six, and the lowest, which is the κύβος, or ace, τοῦ κύβου, õπερ ἐστὶ, μόναδος.
For the word κύβος has two significations :
first, the die itself, αὐτὸ TO ἀναρριπτούμενον, as in the line ἀεὶ yap εὖ πίπτουσιν οἱ Διὸς κύβοι, and secondly, the ace, as in the line βέβληκ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς δύο κύβω καὶ τέτταρα, that is to say two aces and a four,' of ἐπεισόδιον.
The Scholiast quotes an allusion of Eupolis to the same line, ἀποφθαρεὶς δὲ δύο κύβω καὶ τέτταρα.
There seems to be nothing in the suggestion that under the name of Achilles, Dio- nysus is referring to Aeschylus as having made a good hit, or to Euripides as having made a bad one.
1401.
στάσις]
Weighing, a meaning more commonly found in compounds, such as Ψυχοστασία, than in this simple form.
And perhaps, after all, στάσις may bear its more ordinary signification of "contest," "dispute";
since this is not merely their last weighing, it is also the last round altogether in the poetical competition.
1402.
σιδηροβριθές]
Euripides cites a line of his Meleager, doubtless from the narrative of a messenger, describing how the hero " grasped in his right hand an iron-shotted club."
But the heaviest club is as nothing beside the " chariot rolled upon chariot, and corpse on corpse," which Aeschylus cites from his Glaucus Potniensis.
The Scholiast on Eur. Phoen.
1194 adds another line, the couplet standing, according to Valckenaer's correction, as follows :
—1406.
Αἰγύπτιοι]

Cf. Birds 1133, and the Scholiast there.1407.
κατ᾽ ἔπος]
The same expression as supra 1198.
As before, Aeschylus wishes to deal with the subject in a wholesale manner.
And he again (cf. supra 943) refers to the great library of Euripides.
He may step into the scale and take all his books with him, and add to these his wife, his children, and his friend Cephisophon, and then Aeschylus will weigh down the lot with only two of his lines.
1411.
ἄνδρες φίλοι]
The aspirate, which was added by Seager, turns an address to the audience, Good people all, into a substantive proposition, Both are my friends.1413.

The exceeding cleverness of Euripides fascinates his intellect:
the nobility of Aeschylus touches his heart.

οὐδὲν K.T.X.]
Pluto (see the note on 830 supra) now opens his mouth for the first time, and speaks to some purpose too ;
for by means of his inter- vention the plot is jerked back into its original groove as abruptly as it was jerked out of it, supra 757.
During the intervening space, the purpose for which Dionysus came down has been entirely ignored, and the poetical competition has proceeded on its own merits.
Now, however, Pluto announces that the suc- cessful poet shall-not occupy the chair of tragic art at his table, but—reascend with Dionysus to the upper world.
And Dionysus improves on this idea by giving the go-by to the poetic competition altogether, and determining to take the poet who will be the most useful ad- viser to the tottering Republic.
TheFive-score Egyptians could not lift that weight.

A form of thanks properly addressed to a mortal, as in Eur.
Phoen.
1086, and of course having a somewhat comic effect when applied to Pluto.
πύθεσθέ μου· ἀκσύσατε.—Scholiast.1419.
τοὺςχοροὺς ἄγῃ ] Dr. Merry’s explanation “τοὺς χοροὺς, scilicet at the plays about to be produced at the Great Dionysia, which would come on some two months later," seems to me alto- gether inadequate.
It was not for so slight a purpose as this that a noble poet was to be called up from the underworld.
Men's hearts were at this time failing them for fear, lest Athens, if she fell into the hands of her enemies, should share the fate of the many Hel- lenic communities which she herself had swept from the face of the earth :
and then the great dithyrambic choruses of fifty men or fifty boys, with which the ten tribes year by year contended :
then the splendid dramatic choruses which, at the city Dionysia, drew all the friendly Hellenic world to her theatre :
and all other choral worship of the gods would be silenced and dumb for evermore.
It was to avert this terrible catastrophe that the wise counsels of the old Μαραθωνομάχης were needed by his anxious countrymen :
infra 1501, 1530.
And really, when we remember that these choral contests formed part of a great religious solemnity, we may per- haps, without offence, look upon this line as the Athenian counterpart of the sacred prayer in the Church's Benedictus, "That we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, may serve Thee without foar."1422.
περὶ’Αλκιβιάδου]
No more urgent problem could have been propounded than this :
and it is plain from the language placed in the mouth of Diony- sus that it was seriously exercising the minds of the Athenians at this particular season ;
ἡ πόλις γὰρδυστοκεῑ, the city is in sore travail for a solution, but cannot bring to the birth.
Alcibiades was now for the second time in exile, and was residing on his private estate in the Chersonese.
Would it be wise to recall him ?
His genius, both in council and in war, was so transcendent that it might possibly even yet pull the Athen- ians through their troubles :
but the man himself was so wayward and meteoric that it might be unsafe to entrust him with the supreme command.
Nevertheless the period of his dictator- ship was undeniably the most hopeful period subsequent to the Sicilian cata- strophe :
and this at least is certain, that had he been retained in command of the fleet, the final disaster at Aegospotami would never have happened:
it was rendered possible only by his successors' neglect of his personal warnings.
To describe the feelings of Athens towards Alcibiades, Aristophanes adapts a line of Ion of Chios.
His translator might adapt a line of Shakespeare (Othello, iii. 3), She dotes, yet doubts;
suspects, yet strongly loves.1427.
μισῶπολίτην, κ.τ.λ.]
Euripides, always the first to begin, is ready with an epigrammatic criticism on the general character of Alcibiades.
And so far as he means that Alcibiades had wrought his country infinitely more harm than good, his criticism is abundantly justified:
but the particular wording is possibly' not free from objection.
For when Alcibiades was minded to assist theNow then, whichever of you two shall best Advise the city, he shall come with me.

AESCH.
’Twere best to rear no lion in the state:
Athenians, his strokes were just as rapid, and his resources as ample, on their behalf, as they were at other times on behalf of their enemies.
1431.
οὐ χρη̇ κ.τ.λ.]
In this political catechism we more than once light upon (what seem to be) traces of the double representation of the play.
I take it that in the first performance the lines ran :
But this being open to the objection ' that, literally, it meant "you ought to humour a lion's whelp,” Aristophanes altered it intoAnd this was the final form of the speech.
Plutarch (Alcibiades, chap. 16) cites the last-mentioned couplet as the entire maxim :
and Valerius Maximus (vii. 2. 7) must have read it in the same way, since the advice given was, he says, " non oportere in nrbe nutriri leonem;
sin autem sit alitus, obsequi ei convenire " ;
though other commentators draw other conclusions from these passages.
Fritz- sche indeed takes the intermediate line to be an interposition of Dionysus, refer- ring not to the king of the beasts, but to Leon the Athenian general, Most cer- tainly we ought not to rear a Leon in the state :
a somewhat ludicrous idea, though supported by all the learning and in- genuity of a most learned and ingeni- ous scholar.
The lines themselves are thoroughly Aeschylean, and as Hermann (Opnscula, ii. 332, &c.) observes, if they do not actually occur in some lost tragedy, are probably adumbrated from the parable in the third chorus of the Agamemnon.1433.
δυσκριτως ἕχω]
A somewhat peculiar expression, probably taken from a fragment, to which Bergler refers, of the Erechtheus of Euripides :
1434.
σοφῶς ... ϭοφῶς]
Dionysus had asked the rivals to advise the state, τῇ πό- λει παραινέσειν.
Euripides had answered ϭαφῶς ;
he had uttered a smart epigram- matic criticism on the character of Alcibiades, but nobody could tell whether he would advise or oppose the return of the exile.
Aeschylus had spoken ϭαφῶς ;
there was no doubt as to the course he advised, viz.
that the state, having the misfortune to possess an Alcibiades, should bear with his humours, and avail itself of his talents.
The reply of Euripides was clever, the reply of Aeschylus was clear.1437.
εἴ πις πτερώϭας]
The construc- tion changes in the next line, leaving these words in the air.
This and the four following lines are usually and I think rightly enclosed in brackets.
It cannot be doubted that the words ἐγὼ μὲν olda form an immediate response to the question put.
But whether these lines are interpolated from some otherBut having reared, 'tis best to humour him.

If on our present tack we fail, we surelyplace, or whether we have again here, in juxtaposition, passages from the original and revised editions (so to speak) of the Frogs, it is difficult to form an opinion.
Cleocritus was a gawky mis- shapen Athenian, who from some pecu- liarity of appearance or gait was thought to resemble an ostrich ;
see Birds 877.
And as an ostrich has no wings for flight, he is to be furnished with wings in the person of the extravagantly slim and slender Cinesias.
See Birds 1372-8.
These two will then rise from the earth and be wafted by the breezes over the watery plain.
Thence, when the fleets are engaged in battle, they will rain down vinegar into the eyes of the foe.
And so, says Bergler, the foe being blinded will be all the more easily defeated.
See Schömann (Opuscula, i. 308), who thinks, with much probability, that the following line is taken as it stands from some lost play of Euripides.1442.
ἐγὼ μὲν οἶδα]
The question having been asked, Euripides, like a forward boy in a school class, is eager to announce at once that he is prepared with the answer.
1445.
ἀμαθέϭτερον]
This verse seems to have been turned into the proverb which the Scholiast quotes :
1451.
εὗ γ’, ὧ Παλάμηδες]
Note the difference in signification between these words and the εὗ γ’, ὧ Πόϭειδον of 1430 supra.
ὧ Πόϭειδον was an appeal to the god ;
ὦ
Παλάμηδες is addressed to Euri- pides himself, as a compliment to his amazing cleverness.
The artfulness of Palamede foiled even the craft of Odys- seus.
The latter, to avoid the necessity of joining in the Trojan expedition, feigned himself mad, and ploughing with an ox and an ass pretended to sow salt in the furrows ;
but Palamede, placing the infant Telemachus before the plough, at once discovered the sanity of the ploughman.
He was also famous as the inventor of dice, and many other discoveries.
Euripides gave his name to one of his plays, which is parodied in the Thesmophoriazusae.1455. πόθεν;
] ’Αρνητικῶς, ἀντὶ ποῦ οὐδα- —Scholiast.
This use of the inter- rogative πόθεν is by no means uncommon:
Wasps 1145 ;
Eccl. 389, 976;
Aelian, V. H. xiii. 2 and Perizonins there.1459. χλαῖνα ... ϭιϭύρα] " Neither broadcloth nor frieze," as we might say.
It is fruitless to speculate in what manner the χλαîνα or tunic of ordinary wear represented the χρηϭτοὺς, or the ϭιϭύρα, a rough coat of skins, the πονηρούς.
The words have no special application of this kind:
they are merely a proverbial saying about people who are satisfied neither with one alter- native nor yet with the other.1460.
εἴπερ ἀναδύϭει πάλιν] "
If you shall return to the world above," says Dionysus, "find out some way of saving Athens." "

Nor can they mean, as Dr. Blaydes and others translate them, si quidem emergere hinc ad superos vis:
a signification which cannot be found in the Greek, and would turn the reply of Aeschylus into absolute nonsense.1463.
τὴν γῆν ὅταν κ.τ.λ.]
The coyness of Aeschylus is apparently intended to lend greater emphasis to his counsel when it comes.
It is, as the Scholiast observes, the counsel which was given by Pericles at the commencement of the war (Thuc. i. 140-144).
"What if the enemy ravages Attica ?
So long as Athens is mistress of the sea, the whole world will be open to her fleets."
The third line conveys the same advice in another form.
They are to consider their fleet to be their real wealth ;
and mere money stores, not expended on their fleet, to be unworthy of the name of wealth.
Dionysus concurs in this, but as to spending money on the fleet, he observes that the dicasts alone absorb it all, atra, To χρήματα involved in the word πόρον.
This observation is in striking contrast to the argument in Wasps 660-5, where it is shown that not one tithe of the revenue went into the pockets of the dicasts.
And although since that date the revenue had greatly declined, the statement here is doubtless a comic ex- aggeration.
The word καταπίνει is em- ployed in precisely the same signification by St. Chrysostom (Horn. i. in Titum, 735 A), καταπίνει τὰ τῶν πενήτων.1467.
αὕτη ϭφῷν κ.τ.λ.]
This shall be your judgement:
or, in other words, thus will I decide between you.
The following line, to which these words are the intro- duction, is plainly a quotation from some lost play of Euripides.1469.
ὤμοϭας]
It is idle to inquire when and where such an oath could have been given;
the statement is placed in the mouth of Euripides merely as an opening for the retort which is immediately delivered.
The crisis of the drama has arrived, and Aristophanes surrounds it with a series of brilliant repartees which must have been irresis- tible even to the partisans of Euripides.1470.
τοὺς φίλους] ’Εμέ.—Scholiast.
This use of the plural φίλους for the singular ἐμὲ was probably derived from the scene in the Hippolytus (607-613) which gives us also the succeeding line.
Hippolytus has pledged himself not to reveal the secret which the nurse is desirous of unfolding, but when he hears what the secret is, when he learns that his stepmother Phaedra has con- ceived an incestuous passion for himself, he at first declines to be bound by his oath, and to keep the intelligence from his father.
The nurse declares that she will be ruined if he repeats her tale, and the following dialogue ensues :
— where the σοὺς φίλους of the last verse seems equivalent to the με of the first.1471.
ἡ γλῶττ’ ὀμώμοκ’]
Euripides, one of the earliest and keenest of casuists, was perpetually raising ques- tions which, however he might answer them himself, came as a shock to the honest instincts of Athenian morality.
The suggestion that perjury might in some cases be justified, especially on so flimsy a plea as that the mind had not assented to what the tongue had sworn,Are their true wealth, their so-called wealth delusion.

might well seem to imperil the very framework of society :
and perhaps no line that ever was written made so deep an impression on the public as the line, quoted in the preceding note, from which the words in the text were bor- rowed.
Aristophanes thrice refers to it, here, supra 101, and still earlier in Thesm.
275.
In the last-mentioned passage Euripides pledges his oath to Mnesilochus that he will not desert him, whereupon Mnesilochus responds :
—
And please remember 'twas your MIND that swore, Not your tongue only :
please remember that.
Plato alludes to it twice, Theactetus, 154 D;
Symposium, 199 A. Cephisodo- rus, a disciple of Isolates, selected this line as a special instance of the immoral sayings of poets and sophists.
—Ath. iii. 94. Aristotle in the Rhetoric (iii. 15.
8) tells us that, Euripides being involved in a lawsuit, his opponent up- braided him with this line, apparently meaning that the poet could not be trusted even when speaking upon oath ;
whereto Euripides replied that his op- ponent was himself acting illegally, in bringing before the legal judges a rem judicatam, a matter of which the theatri- cal judges had already disposed.
Lucian refers to it in his Vitarum auctio, 9. Cicero (De Officiis, iii. 29) shows that on philosophical grounds the aphorism may well be supported.
However, in the play itself, Hippolytus himself abandons it.
Many other passages are collected by the industry of Valckenaer and Bp. Monk in their notes on the Hippolytus.
Origen condemns a sect of heretics for teaching that it was no sin to deny their Lord with their tongue, so that they denied him not with their heart, τῷ ϭτόματι ἀρνήϭεται, τῇ δὲ καρδίᾳ οὐχί.— Euseb.

"He forgets that he is speaking to a god," says Bergler;
"so in Birds 1638 Heracles addresses Poseidon as ὦ δαιμόνι’ ἀνθρώπων Πόσειδον.”
To which Dr. Blaydes adds Plutus 78.
And cf. supra 1160.1475.
Tt δ' αἰϭχρόν]
This is parodied from another questionable line of Euri- pides, τί δ’ αἰσχρὸν, ἢν μὴ τοῖσι χρωμένοιs δοκῇ;
It occurred in his Aeolus, that notorious play which represented the incestuous union of a brother and sister (see the note on 863 supra) ;
and, taken literally, it seemed to make right and wrong depend upon the opiuion of the agent.
What’s wrong if they who do it think not so?
It was believed in after times, that when these words were first pronounced by the actor, a great tumult arose in the theatre, and a voice, which tradition ascribed to Antisthenes, was heard to reply, Nay, wrong is wrong, whatever men may think, αἰσχρὸν τό γ’ αἰσχρὸν, κἂν δοκῇ κἂν μὴ δακῇ.
(Plutarch, De Andiendis Poetis, 12.)
Athenaeus (xiii, chap. 45) quotes some lines of Machon, in which the Corinthian Lais, like Dionysus here, makes use of this line to barb a cutting repartee against Euripides himself.
The lines may be roughly rendered as follows :
—
Lais of Corinth, so the story goes, Beheld Euripides with pen and tablet Out in a garden.
Poet, she exclaimed, Whatever made you say in your Medea, " Off, shameless hussy" ?
Then the bard, amazed
At the girl's cheek, said, Are you not yourself A shameless hussy?
Lais laughed, and answered, What's shameless if your lovers think not so?
The exclamation ἔρῤ αἰσχραποιὲ is from Jason's speech to Medea (Med. 1343).
The word χρωμέναις, as used by the poet, means merely the performers of the act in question ;
as used by the courtesan, it means her lovers :
cf.
Wasps 1028, and the note there.
Fritzsche's conjec- ture that the preceding line, αἴσχιστον ἕργον πρασβλέπεις μ’ εἰργασμένος;
also came from the Aeolus, and was addressed by Aeolus to his incestuous son, to which Macareus replied with the line before us, would destroy the whole humour of the passage.
Dionysus would be merely continuing a quotation, in- stead of making a felicitous and un- expected repartee ;
and Euripides must have been deserted by all his σαφία when he deliberately led up to such a damaging retort.
1476.
τεθνηκάτα]
Probably as he utters this word,Euripides drops to the ground,Dio.
What's shameful, if the audience think not so ?
EUR.
Have you no heart ?
Wretch, would you leave me dead ?

PLUTO.
Now, Dionysus, come ye in, DID.
What for ?
PLUTO.
And sup before ye go.
Dio.
A bright idea.and there remains, after the fashion of Cleon in the Knights, till the conclusion of the play.1477.
τίς οἶδεν]
Yet a third time Dionysus replies to the disappointed tragedian with a line borrowed from his own tragedies, and a third time Euripides rots οἰκείοις πτεροῖς ἁλίσκεται.
The idea is twice found in the fragments of Euripides :
And againSome discover in these passages a fore- cast of the sublime doctrine of the Faith.
And truly the language is well adapted to express the Christian view of death.
A great Persian archbishop, exhorting his fellow martyrs in Sapor's persecution, declared ζωὴν ἀληθῶς εἶναι TO ὧδε ἀποθανεῖν (Sozomen, Eccl. Hist. ii. 10).
And Theodoret's ordinary way of recording a Christian's death is to say εἰς τὴν ἀγήρω καὶ ἄλυπον μετέστη ζωὴν, "he passed to the life which knows, no ending, the tearless life."
And see Plato's Gorgias, chap. 47.
However, on the lips of Euripides the lines seem rather to be an expression of philosophic doubt.
"
What do we know of life or death ?
We call those yet on earth, the living, and those in the world below, the dead.
Yet, perchance, those in the world below call our state death, and their own life."
The next line, of course, is a mere burlesque addition of Dionysus.1479.
τί δαί]
Dionysus seems a little surprised, if not a little alarmed, at receiving an invitation from Pluto.
And in truth the real reason why Pluto seeks to get him behind the scenes is to deprive him of the professional actor who has hitherto represented Dionysus, but who in the closing scene is to give greater dignity to the utterances of Pluto.
Accordingly when Pluto re- appears at line 1500 he is represented by the state actor, and becomes the chief speaker, whilst Dionysus, if he reappears at all, is represented by Pluto's choregic actor, and sinks into the unwonted position of a mute.1480. σφώ]
Dionysus and Aeschylus, who are to be entertained in the halls of Pluto before sailing away over the Acherusian lake.1482.
μακάριος κ.τ.λ.]
During the ab- sence of Pluto and his guests, the Chorus sing an airy little strophe and anti- strophe, each consisting of nine trochaic lines;
the strophe in praise of Aeschylus, the antistrophe in depreciation of Euripides.1484.. πάρα]
For πάρεστι Thisicemay learn by many an example.1492.
παρακαθήμενον λαλεῖν]
Nobody could be long in the company of Socrates without being drawn into some argumentative conversation.
Ov ῥᾴδιον, says Theodorus in the twenty-first chapter of the Theaetetus (to which Mr. Mitchell refers) ov paStor, ὦ Σώκρατες, σοὶ παρακαθήμενον μὴ διδόναι λόγον.
This perpetual talking which surrounded Socrates is in truth the ἀδολεσχία of which the comic poets speak (Clouds 1480 ;
Eupolis, Fragm. Inc. 10), and to which Plato makes such a pathetic reference in the fourteenth chapter of the Phaedo.
The reproach still clung to him after his death ;
and even in the islands of the Blessed, Lucian (Ver. Hist.
I' faith, I'm nowise indisposed for that.
CHOR.
Blest the man who possesses a Keen intelligent mind.
This full often we find.

RIGHT it is and befitting, Not, by Socrates sitting, Idle talk to pursue, Stripping tragedy-art of All things noble and true.
Surely the mind to school Fine-drawn quibbles to seek, Fine-set phrases to speak, Is but the part of a fool!
PLUTO.
Farewell then, Aeschylus, great and wise,ii. 17) represents him ἀδολεσχοῦντα with Nestor and Palamede, encircled by a group of the most beautiful youths :
till Rhadamanthus threatens to expel him from the island, ἢν φλυαρῇ, καὶ μὴ θέλῃ, ἀφεὶς τὴν εἰρωνείαν, εὐωχεῖσθαι.1500. ἄγε δή]
Pluto and Aeschylus, probably accompanied by other ban- queters, amongst whom may perhaps have appeared the venerable form of Sophocles, re-enter the stage :
and the former (now represented by one of the three state actors) bids farewell to the victorious poet, and entrusts him with a commission to be executed on his return to Athens.
He is to present halters to several obnoxious citizens, who are to terminate their existence therewith without unnecessary delay.
And if they hesitate, then Pluto, who once ascended to the plains of Enna tobring back his queen Persephone, will in like manner ascend to the streets of Athens, and after branding and fetter- ing them as his runaway slaves, will drive them before him to the under- world.
The first line of Pluto's speech is very similar to a line (154) in the Peace, ἀλλ’ aIe, Πήγασε, χώρει χαίρων, but the words χώρει χαίρων have not quite the same meaning in the two lines, since here, as in the ἴθι χαίρων of Knights 498, Wasps 1009, and elsewhere, they involve the notion of "farewell," which is absent in the line of the Peace.1501.
ἡμετέραν]
In this last solemn scene-for a solemn scene it is, although it occurs in a comedy-Pluto, as Dr. Merry observes, is paying a compliment to Athens, by identifying himself with her citizens.
The Scholiast's explana- tion, TOVTO ἔφη ὁ Πλούτων ἐπεὶ προσήκει ἡ ’Αττικὴ Δήμητρι καὶ Κόρῃ, is a little too far-fetched.
1504. δὸς τουτί] ̌Ισως σχοινίον ἐπιδί- δωσιν αὐτῷ o Πλούτων πρὸς ὰγχόνην, says the Scholiast, and again on the following line, εἴη δ’ ἂν σχοινίον o ἐπιδίδωσιν αὐταῖς.
And it seems to me far more probable that he gives three halters than that, as Elmsley suggests in a note on Ach.
784, he gives a dagger for one, a halter for another, and hemlock for the third.
As to Cleophon, see supra 678, infra. 1532.
He at least was not slow in obeying the .
summons of Pluto, dying in the following year.1505.
πορισταῖς]
These were officials upon whom devolved the duty of pro- viding ways and means by the imposition of taxes, and apparently of superintend- ing the collection of the taxes.
They were our Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Board of Inland Revenue rolled into one.
We read in Ecclesiazusae 823-9 that the city had then recently been in urgent need of 500 talents, andGo, save our state by the maxims rare
Of thy noble thought;
and the fools chastise, For many a fool dwells there.
And this to Cleophon give, my friend, And this to the revenue-raising crew, Nicomachus, Myrmex, next I send, And this to Archenomus too.
And bid them all that without delay, To my realm of the dead they hasten away.
For if they loiter above, I swear I'll come myself and arrest them there.
And branded and fettered the slaves shall go, With the vilest rascal in all the town, Adeimantus, son of Leucolophus, down,that Euripides (possibly the poet's son) ἐπόρισεν, that is, devised as one of the πορισταὶ the means of raising it by a property tax of 2½ per cent.
The people were delighted to think that so large a sum could be raised by so slight an imposition ;
but when it was found that the tax did not realize anything like the required amount, Euripides was abused as cordially as he had at first been praised.
Myrmex and Nicomachus are supposed to have been guilty of embezzlement in carrying out their financial schemes :
and it is probably to these very persons, and to this very passage, that the gloss of Photius and of Suidas refers, πορισταί.
οἱ τοὺς πόρ
ους εἰσηγούμενοι δημαγωγοὶ ἐπὶ τῷ έαυτῶν λυσιτελεῖ.
And certainly if this is, as Paulmier supposes, the Nicomachus against whom Lysias inveighs in his thirtieth oration, we can well believe him to have been guilty of any amount of embezzlement.
And see the note on 1083 supra.
It is interesting to observe that, in the speech of Lysias, Nicomachus is said by means of a forged law to have brought about the death of Cleophon.
Of Myrmex and Archenomus nothing is known.1513.
Ἀδειμάντου]
What induced the poet to include Adeimantus in his list of reprobates, we cannot tell:
but that he had good reason for doing so may be inferred from the fact that this Adeimantus is the Athenian commander who was credited with having, a few months later, on the fatal day of Aegospotami, betrayed to Lysander the entire Athenian fleet.
His father, here called Leucolophus, is elsewhere called Leucolophides (Xen. Hell. i. 4. 21;
Plato, Protagoras, 7).
Possibly he was Leucolophus, the son of Leucolophus,and was therefore sometimes called by his patronymic to distinguish him from his own father.
This double nomen- clature is by no means uncommon.
The father of Euripides is called indifferently Mnesarchus and Mnesarchides ,see Suidas s. v. Euripides.
The archon eponymus for the year 394-3 is sometimes called Eubulus, and sometimes Eubulides.
See Clinton's F. H. on that year.
And many other examples might be given.1519.
ϭοΦίο̣]
That is, in the art of tragedy.
Cf. supra 766, 776, 780.1524. Φαίνετε]
Πρὸς τὸν χορόν. ἀντὶ τοῦ, ἀνάπτετεὦ μύσται.—Scholiast.
The torches were lighted when the Chorus entered, supra 313, 344, but were probably extinguished at line 459, if not before.
Here the mystics are bidden to relight them, Light for him the holy torches, and doubtless obey the order at once.
There is much in these directions, as Bergler observes, which recalls the concluding scene of the Eumenides.1526.
μέλεσιν]
Here again the μέλος is regarded in its metrical aspect (see the note on 1250 supra), the musical element being added by the word μολπαῖσιν which follows.
For it is in their metre and their music only thatDown, down to the darkness below.

This chair of mine Meanwhile to Sophocles here commit, (For I count him next in our craft divine,) Till I come once more by thy side to sit.

While the holy torches quiver and blaze.

First, as the poet triumphant is passing away to the light, Grant him success on his journey, ye powers that are ruling below.
Grant that he find for the city good counsels to guide her aright;
So we at last shall be freed from the anguish, the fear, and the woe, Freed from the onsets of war.
Let Cleophon now and his bandthe six hexameters with which the play concludes belong to Aeschylus.
The words are the words of Aristophanes, though naturally in composing the verses he gives even to the language itself an Aeschylean colouring.
The Scholiast quotes from the Glaucus Pot- niensis, εὐοδίαν μὲν πρῶτον and στόματος χέομέν [o-ot] :
and Bergler from the Eumenides (966), εἴη δ' ἀγαθῶν ἀγαθὴ διάνοια πολίταις.
The μέλος signifies the final triumph of the metre assailed by Euripides, supra 1264-1292.1532.
ΚλεοΦῶν]
Of the career of this demagogue we have few details beyond the fact that on two distinct occasions he was the evil genius of Athens, persuading her to reject a peace which was her only hope of salvation.
First, after the brilliant success of Alcibiades at Cyzicus (Diod. Sic. xiii. 53), and again after the more important victory of Arginusae (Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 34), the Lacedaemonians made overtures to Athens for the con- clusion of a general peace on the uti possedetis principle ;
and on each occa-, sion it was mainly through the in- strumentality of Cleophon that these overtures were rejected.
Well might Aeschines (adv. Ctes. 150) aver that ΚλεοΦῶν τὴν πόλιν ἀπώλεσεν.
His out-rageous conduct on the second occasion is narrated by Aristotle, ubi supra, and Aeschines de F. L. 80, and having occurred shortly before the exhibition of.
this play is doubtless the reason why he is here bidden to go and fight, since fighting is what he so much desires, in his native fields of Thrace (his mother's country, see supra 678 and the note there, and see also the Introduction to this play).
The advice here given to Cleophon may remind the reader of that given, though for a very different reason, to the πατραλοίας in the Birds,Battle, if battle they must, far away in their own fatherland.1533.
τούτεν]
Even if this refers to the spectators generally, the πάτριοι ἄρουραι must be confined to the native fields of Cleophon.
But probably τούτων means " of Cleophon's clique," who very possibly, like Cleophon himself, may have had a strain of barbarian blood in their veins.
Let Cleophon, and such as Cleophon, go and fight in their own barbarian fatherlands, and leave Athens and Attica in peace and quietness.
THE ancient critics, in selecting the plays of the Athenian dramatists which have come down to the modern world, usually commenced their Aristophanic series with the Plutus, the Clouds, and the Frogs.
And as their selections have not always come to our hands in a complete form, there are more MSS.
of these three plays than of any other comedy of Aristophanes.
Whilst some of the later plays of the series exist in a few MSS.
only, there are no less than thirty MSS.
which contain the whole or part of the Frogs.
The letters by which the MSS.
are designated vary in different editions of Aristophanes, and in none (except in the case of two or three of the principal MSS.) bear any relation to the MSS.
themselves.
I have therefore recast the nomenclature, denoting all the Venetian MSS.
by the letter V, all the Parisian by P, all the Florentine by F, the Milanese by M, the Oxford by 0, the Cambridge by C, the London by L, that of Modena by m, that of Munich (the initial being already appropriated) by H, the Viennese by W, the Elbing by E, and the Borgian by B, whilst I have retained the letters R and U for the Ravenna and the Vaticano-Urbinas respectively.
The Parisian MSS.
having been collated by Brunck, I have, for convenience sake, included among the P's his own private MS., which subsequently formed part of Richard Heber's collection, and is now in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge.
It is on the foregoing principle that the following table is con- structed :
— R. The Ravenna MS.
V. The first Venetian (No. 474, St. Mark's Library, Venice).
M. The first Milanese (No. L 39, St. Ambrose Library, Milan).
P. The first Parisian (No. 2712, National Library, Paris).
U. The Vaticano-Urbinas (No. 141, Urbino).
(The readings of the foregoing MSS.
are taken from Velsen's very careful and minute collations.)
P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717).
P3. The fourth Parisian (C. B. 2).
P5. Brunck's own MS.
(Brunck's edition is founded on a collation of P, P2, P3, P5.) P4. The fifth Parisian (No. 2820).

(The readings of the MSS.
from P4 downwards are taken from the notes of Bekker, Dindorf, Blaydes, and others.)
The editions of the Frogs in my own possession, from which the following synopsis is compiled, are as follows.

A complete enumeration of all the various readings of the MSS.
and editions, and of all the, conjectures of critics, would be far too lengthy and confusing for a work of this character;
and only those are given which seem of some possible interest.
It is needless to say that great assistance has been derived from Dr. Blaydes's collection of various readings and conjectures;
assistance for which I am all the more grateful, because I had to compile the Appendices to the Peace and the Wasps without it.
It is perhaps desirable to explain that words cited from the text are given the accent required by their position in the text, and not that required by their altered position in the Appendix.4.
χολή.
Dawes proposed to read σχολή, treating the words πλὴν πιέξομοι, τοῦτο δὲ Φύλαξαι as parenthetical, and translating Immo quidquid tibi lubet (praeterquam, "premor," ab hoc autem temperes velim), omnino enim jam vacat.
οχολή appears in some MSS. of Suidas, s. v. πᾴνν γάρ eUr' ἤδη χολή, and it was originally written in, but afterwards erased from P. Ps.
But it was justly condemned by Bentley;
and Thiersch is the only editor who has adopted it in preference to the MS.
reading.7, γε μόνον ἐκεῖν' V. and all the best MSS.
(save that R. omits ἐκεῖν'alto- gether) Bentley, Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Bothe, Bergk, Kock, Velsen, Van Leeuwen.
γ'ἐκεῖνο μόνον a few inferior MSS.
and the other editions.15.
τοῖςσκευοΦοροῦσιν.
All the editions before Brunck read σκεύη Φέρουσ' in two words, placing a colon, some after ποιεῖν, and others after Άμειψίας, and taking Φέρουσ' to be the third person plural of the present indicative.
They therefore make Xanthias impart to the audience the irrelevant information that certain of their popular comedians " are always bearing burdens in their comedies."
Brunck was the first, and perhaps the only editor, and (with the exception of Reiske) the first, and perhaps the only scholar, who rightly comprehended the meaning of the passage.
He found in P. and P5. σκευηΦ
οροῦσ'written in one word, and in P3. σκευοΦοροῦσ' with, what was more suggestive, τοῖς optima glossa superscripta, and saw at once that σκευη- Φοροῦσ' (as he read it) was the dative plural of the participle, as indeed Reiske had seen before.
Φέρουσι, said Reiske, est datirus pluralis cohaerens cum ποιεῖν.
Brunck therefore wrote the line σκευηΦο- ροῦϭ' έκάϭτοτ'.
But ϭκευΦορείν is really vox nihili ;
the compound is σκενορείν.
The article τοῖς seems absolutely neces- sary ;
and scholars insist, perhaps with too great strictness, that the final iota of the dative cannot suffer elision.
I therefore read ταῖς σκευοΦοροῦσιν.
τοῖς σκευοΦοροῦσινιs found in the Scholiast;
τοῖς σκεοΦοροῦσ'in C. and (with the τοῖς superscribed) in O. and P3.
It would be easy to read τοῖς σκευοΦόροιςιf it is wished to adopt the idea propounded by Elmsley on Ach.
178 ;
but this form receives no support from the MSS., and the two anapaests in the second and third places are of very common occur- rence, being found in two more lines within the next sixty lines of this play.
The other MS.
readings are σκευοΦορῦσ' (which of course is unmetrical without the τοῖς) M. V1. Suidas s.v. Λύκις. σκευη- Φοροῦσ' V. P. P5. F1. F2. F3. F5- M1. m. ' σκεύη Φέρουσ' R. W. W1. W2. F4. οἴσκεύη Φέρ
ουσ' P2. οἵ σκευοΦοροῦσ'V2. Cl.
And this was Porson's suggestion, and has on his great authority been adopted by Thiersch, Merry, and Blaydes, notwith- standing that it is vitiated by the patent absurdity, mentioned above, of making Xanthias impart the information to the spectators.
οἵτινες σκευηΦοροῦσ'
H.
Most recent editors either bracket or omit the line, though it is really essential to the sense.

ἐρεῖ. Cobet prosaically proposes ἐρῶ, which Meineke introduces into the text.
27. οὕνος(for ὁ ὄνος).
So MSS.
and editions except as hereinafter mentioned.
R. and E. have ὄνος, which is brought into the text by Invernizzi, Fritzsche, and Meineke, who absurdly suppose that Dionysus meant to imply that Xanthias is an ὄνος.
This characteristic little dialogue, 26-9, is by Hamaker character- istically struck out.67.
καὶ ταῦτα TOV τεθνηκότας.
These words, without the note of interrogation, form part of the uninterrupted speech of Dionysus in the MSS.
and early editions.
Kuster, following some ancient critics mentioned by the Scholiast, was the first to transfer them to Heracles, and to add the note of interrogation.
Kuster's alteration, though overlooked for a time, is followed by Fritzsche and all subsequent editors.
76. οὐ. The MSS.
and early editions have οὐχὶ, but Bentley, observing that the last syllable of ΣαΦακλέα is long, proposed either to change οὐχὶ into ov, or to omit ὄντ'.
The former alternative is adopted by Dindorf and all subsequent editors.
ὄντ' " ἀντ'confidenter corrigit vir amicus A. Palmer, coIL Eccl. 925 οὐδεὶς yap ὥς σε πρότεραν εἴσεισ' ἀντ' ἐμοῦ. Quam correctionem palmariam recepi."
—Blaydes.
And so Van Leeuwen.
But Heracles, proposing that Dionysus should bring back Sophocles instead of Euripi- des, was bound to give some reason for his suggestion;
and this is furnished by the MS., but not by the proposed, reading.
And indeed if no such reason were required, I should prefer Bentley's second alternative to Palmer's correc- tion.77.
ἀνάγειν, εἴπερ γ'. So V1. V2. P2. P3. F2. F3. O. C1. C2. B. W1. W2. Bentley, Dindorf, recentiores, except that Velsen and Van Leeuwen, after a conjecture of Halm, read ἀνάξειν εἴπερ. ἀνάγειν εἴπερ, contra metrum, R. V. ἀναγαγεῖν εἴπερ P. M. U. and a few other MSS.
and all editions, before Dindorf.
The rest of the line is the same in all MSS.
and editions except that Blaydes alters it into εἴπερ γε δεῖ cr' ἀνάγειν τινά ;
which certainly gives a better sense, but is based on no authority.
81. κἂν Dobree, Dindorf, recentiores.
καὶ MSS. edd. veteres.
But two MSS. (P. and m.) supply the ἂνat the end of the verse, reading ἐπιχειρήσειενἄνfor ἐπιχειρήσειέ μοι.83.
ποῦ 'στιν R. V. P. M. U. and ap- parently all the other MSS.
and, except as hereinafter mentioned, all editions.
But R. V. O. H. B. for ἀποίχεταιhave o'lxerat, which makes the line in those MSS.
unmetrical, and a few recent editors have preferred to substitute conjectural alterations for the reading of the vast majority of the MSS.
Thus Meineke and Blaydes read ποῦ σθ' ;
ὅπου 'στ' ;
ἀπαλιπών μ' οἴχεται. and Velsen and Van Leeuwen (after a conjecture of Cobet) ποῦ ποτ' ἔστ';
ὀπολιπώνμ'οἴχετοι.των, And Dobree conjectured that σο- Φοῖς and not Φίλοις is the true reading here;
a conjecture approved, though not adopted, by Blaydes.
But Φίλοις, even if not a reminiscence of the ἦ ποθει- νὸς Φίλοις of Eur.
Phoen. 320, is better suited to the context and infinitely more harmonious.
The ἀγαθὸςat the commencement of the line is a tribute to the genial, kindly nature of the man, which his friends would especially regret.
And so great a master of har- mony as Aristophanes would hardly, in a line in which every word, except the copula, ends with the letter ς, have un necessarily introduced an additional sibilant.
90.
μύρια. Van Leeuwen reads μνρίας, after a conjecture of Dindorf.103.
μἀλλὰ Dobree (after Porson's μὴ ἀλλὰ), Dindorf, recentiores, except Bothe and Thiersch.
μᾶλλα V. μάλα R. O. V1. V2. καὶ μάλαthe other MSS.

Seidler proposed to transfer the words καὶ σύγε to the reply of Dionysus, so that the dialogue would run ἰέναι ;
ΔΙ.
καὶ σύ ye Μηδὲν ἔτι κ.τ.λ.
And this sug- gestion is adopted by Dindorf, Holden, Paley, Kock, Velsen, recentiores.
But I agree with Fritzsche, who says, " Vul- gala lectio et per se aptissima est (tu adeo, inquit, cum tua ignavia, ut ego ire audebis?) et concinne refertur ad v. 108- 111, ubi agebatur de HercuIis ad inferos descensu, quern Bacchus imitari studet.
Seidleri conjectura quum minime neces- saria est, turn orationem e gravi reddit languidam."
And the MS.
reading is supported also by Hermann, Bergk, and Meineke.117.
τῶν ὁδῶν MSS. vulgo.
Fritzsche altered it into νῷν ὁδὸν, and the altera- tion is adopted by Van Leeuwen.118.

θησεὺς ἤγαγεν.
Brunck inserted σφ' between these words, an unnecessary alteration, in which no editor has fol- lowed him.149.
ἠλοίησεν R. V. M. U. and (sub- stantially) the MSS.
generally, and all the editions before Brunck, and Bekker and Bergk afterwards.
Brunck intro- duced the "more Attic" form ἠλόησεν from Suidas, and is followed by the other recent editors.
See infra on 819 and 826.150.
ὄρκον MSS. vulgo.
But the word is omitted in Aldus and Junta, and made its first appearance (in print) in Fracini's edition.
Then it led a fitful existence, appearing only in Gormont, Neobari, and Gelenius, till Kuster finally established it in its place.
151.
ἤ Μορσίμου K.r.X.
Several editors have been much exercised at finding a humorous verse immediately following a string of serious ones ;
and truly, if Aristophanes had not been a comic writer, the contrast would have been worthy of notice.
Velsen encloses the line in brackets.
Bergk would insert it between the two lines which Dionysus forthwith speaks ;
making the first of the three lines of which that speech would then consist end with καὶ instead of κεἰ, the second commence with εἰ instead of ἢ, and the third commence with ἢ instead of τὴν.
Van Leeuwen makes it the third line of the same speech, changing (after Cobet) τις ῥῆσιν into ῥῆσίν τιν'.159.
ἄγων vulgo.
ἄγω R. V. "quae ma- nifesta est grammaticorum conjectura."
—Fritzsche.
It is, h6wever, followed by Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.160.
οὐκαθέξω MSS. vulgo.
Blaydes changes it into οὐκ ἔτ' ἄξω.
But Xanthias means "I will not hold them,'' not "I will not carry them on," which he has not yet been ordered to do.
168.
τῶν ἐκΦερομένων κ.τ.λ.
Hamaker would omit this very necessary verse, and Meineke and Van Leeuwen do so.
What Hamaker's reason was, I know not.
Van Leeuwen's reason is that the word ἔρχεται "Attice non it sed venit significat."
And venit is the sense re- quired here.
169. μὴ εὕρω (or its equivalents μηὕρω and the like) is found in all the MSS.
and in all the editions before Dindorf.
The Scholiast, however, whilst recogniz- ing μηὕρω, observes γράφεται Kat ἔχω, ἤγουν ἐἀν μὴ ἔχω.
ἀργύριον.
I confess that to me this seems preposterous ;
yet ἔχω is adopted by Dindorf, Bothe, Green, Merry, and Blaydes.
Later in the line I have, with Bergk and several recent editors, written τότἔμ' ἄγεξν for the common reading Tore μ' ἄγειν.170.
τινες ἐκφέρουσι τουτονὶ.
This is the reading of U. P3. F4. and (except that for ἐκφέρουσι they have φέρουσι) of R. V. M. P. and all the MSS.
It is also the reading of all the editions before Dindorf.
But Elmsley, at Ach. 127, to prevent an enclitic commencing an anapaest in a senarius (which, however, is by no means uncommon) proposed to alter τινεςιnto τιν', and this alteration is made by Dindorf, Fritzsche, and all subsequent editors.
But the two accu- satives, τινα and τουτυνὶ, do not go very well together, and a nominative is rather wanted for the verb.
Hirschig, there- fore, changed ἐκφέρουσι τουτονὶ into ἐκφέ- ρουσιν οὑτοιὶ, and so Meineke, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
But Dionysus is calling attention to the νεκρὸς, and not to the bearers, and τουτονὶ corresponds with the οὗτος of the following line.
Hirschig's emendation was perhaps rendered necessary by Elmsley's ;
but it is far better to sweep away both emen- dations, and to leave the line as the MSS.
give it.
In the same note, and for the same reason, Elmsley proposed to omit the enclitic με in the δειπνεȋν με δίδασκε of 107 supra :
but there his pro- posal met with no response.175.
ἐὰν P. M. V2. W. W1, F1. F2. F3. F5 H., and all the editions except Thiersch and Velsen.
Of. infra 339. ἵναR. U. P3. W2 Thiersch, Velsen. ἵν' ἂν V. O.177. ἀναβιῴην.
Van Leeuwen, at Cobet's suggestion, reads ἀναβιαην.
180. χωρῶμεν κ.τ.λ.
Not understand- ing this line, Hamaker, after his manner, proposed to strike it out;
and Meineke and Van Leeuwen do so ;
whilst Velsen places it between 182 and 183, so that the words χωρῶμεν ἐπὶ τὸπλαȋαν follow immediately after καὶ πλοȋάν γ'ὁρῶ.181, 182.
Some recent editors, follow- ing the suggestion of Enger and Bergk, distribute these two lines thus :
— which can hardly be right.
ταῦτα ;
λίμνη is Dobree's suggestion (for ταῦτο λίμνη), which I have followed with Fritzsche, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Paley, Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.184.
χαȋρ' ὦ Χάρων.
The Scholiast is obviously the Scholiast's own sugges- tion, and is very improbable.
See the commentary on 177.
It is, however, adopted by Blaydes, who thus brings four actors on the stage at once.
Van Leeuwen gives the first χαȋρ' ὦ Χάρων to Dionysus, speaking leni voce;
the second to Xanthias, speaking alta voce;
the third to both Dionysus and Xanthias, alte clamantibus.
186.
ἄναυπόκας.
So all the MSS., Greek grammarians, and editions except Meineke, Kock, and Van Leeuwen, who, following a suggestion of Conz and others, read "Οκνου πλοκάς;
after a picture by Polygnotus at Delphi, repre- senting a man named Ocnus weaving a rope, and a she-ass standing beside him and eating the rope as fast as he wove it;
an allegory, it is said, of an in- dustrious worker, whose earnings, as fast as he made them, were dissipated by A thriftless wife.
-Pansanias, Phocica, 29.
The idea is certainly ingenious, but 1 agree with Dr. Merry that it is more ingenious than probable.
It is difficult to see what this allegory can have tu do with the world after death;
no such proverb as "Οκναυ πλακὰς is known to exist ;
and there is an overwhelming weight of authority the other way,187.
Taivapov MSS.
vulgo.
Τάρταρον Meineke, who is followed by Holden and Van Leeuwen, the latter saying, Fingi non potest Charon cymba sua Taenarum appulsurus.
Charon, of course, is only going across the lake.
His passengers, like Dionysus and Xanthias, later on, must find their own way to their several destinations.
See the Commentary on 185.189. εἵνεκα(or ἕνεκα), all the best MSS. ;
but here, as everywhere else, Dindorf and others change it to αὕνεκα193.
περιθρέξει MSS. vulgo.

μανθάνεις;
This word is given to Dionysus by the vast majority of the MSS.
and by Brunck and all subsequent editors, except Blaydes.
P. and V. omit the name of Dionysus, but leave a space for it.
On the other hand, R. U. F2. and F4. continue it to Charon;
and so do all the editions before Brunck, and so Blaydes.
Considering how much easier it is to omit than to insert a name, I have retained the ΔΙ.197.
ἔτι πλεῑ Kuster, and all subse- quent editors.
ἐπιπλεȋ MSS. and the editions before Kuster.207.
βατράχων κύκνων.
Bothe suggests, but does not read, βατραχοκύκνων, which is adopted by Meineke, Holden, and Van Leeuwen, and is probable enough.
Velsen reads κυκνοβατράχων, which is much less probable.
216. Διώνυσον.
This, which is Her- mann's emendation for Διόνυσ
ον, is ac- cepted by Dindorf and all subsequent editors except Bothe, Bergk, Paley, and Kock.
It is intended to bring the line into metrical harmony with the preced- ing line, which consists of two iambs, or their equivalent, and a cretic foot, In order to bring the followin line Λίμναισιν ἰαχήσααεν into the same metre, some write the second word ἀχήσαμεν.
But it seems better to change Λίμναισιν into Λίμναις, the a in ἰαχέω being common.223.
βρεκεκεκὲξ κ.τ.λ.
This line is found in R. and (with βρεκεκὲξ here as elsewhere for βρεκεκεκὲξ in P. M. U., and indeed in almost all the MSS.
It is found in every edition before Dindorf, and in Bothe and Van Leeuwen since.
But it is omitted in V. O. C., and by Dindorf and (except as aforesaid) sub- sequent editors.
Why they have re- jected the authority of the great body of MSS.
I cannot tell.
The line seems required by 227 infra, and its omission in any MS. was probably purely acci- dental, and occasioned by the like termination κοὰξ κοάξ of this and the preceding line.
229.
ἔστερξαν εὔλυροι.
Between these words Hermann inserted μὲν, which seems fatal to the metre, if indeed this line corresponds with that which follows.
It is, however, inserted by Bergk, Paley, Velsen, and Blaydes.
Fritzsche reduces lines 228-234 into excellent trochaic dimeters by a variety of ingenious changes, which, being quite unauthorized and having met with no approval, it is unnecessary here to repeat.
239.
βρεκεκεκὲξ κ.τ.λ.
This line, which is continued to Dionysus in all the MSS.
and in all the editions before Fritzsche, is by him transferred to the Frogs ;
and this alteration is followed by Bergk, Meineke, Paley, Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
It is true that Dionysus does not join in the timing song until line 250.
But line 240 does not seem suited to follow an interrup- tion ;
and Dionysus here is not joining in, he is merely ridiculing, the timing song.
And I think, therefore, that the MS.
arrangement is right.
241.
φθεγξόμεσθ' R. Bekker, recen- tiores ( except Bothe). φθεγόμεθ' vulgo.
On the other hand, in 243, where even R. has ὴλάμεθα, all the editions from Aldus downward have ἡλάμεσθα.
In each case the termination -εσθα is re- quired by the metre.
250.
βρεκεκεκὲξ κ.τ.λ.
This line, which in the MSS.
and editions (except as hereinafter mentioned) is continued to the Frogs, I have given to the Frogs and Dionysus conjointly.
Bentley was the first to discern that Dionysus must here speak the line, and he accordingly took it from the Frogs and gave it to Dionysus, taking βρεκεκεκὲξ κοὰξ κοὰξ τουτὶ to- gether.
And so V. and Kock and Velsen.
I should unhesitatingly have followed this, but that the conjoint croak is re- quired also in 256 and 261.
Fritzsche attains the same end by doubling the line in all three places, giving one to the Frogs and the other to Dionysus.
He is followed by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen, and (so far as 256 and 261 are concerned) by Meineke, Holden, Green, Yelsen, and Merry.252.
δεινά τἄρα. (δεινάτ' ἴ.ρα. V). δεινά rapa Elmsley at Ach. 323, and, with a change to δεινά τἄρα, his suggestion has been followed by Dindorf and (with the usual exception of Bothe) by all subse- quent editors.
δεινά γ'ἄρα vulgo.
δεινὰ γὰρ R. After this verse Brunck inserts, from P., the words εἰ σιγήσομεν, which are obviously a mere explanatory gloss.
"
Miser iste pannus scholiastae nescio cujusdam," says Fritzsche, "repugnat metre, repugnat grammaticae (futurum est enim σιγήσομαι, non σιγήσω, ut recte Dindorfius), repugnat denique ipsi sen- tentiae, nec plus fidei meretur quam similis glossa scholiastae Victorian!, εἰ κωλύσειςἡμᾶς τοῦ βοᾶν."264.
οὐδὲ μὴν ὑμεȋς γ'ἐμέ.
This line, found in every MS.
and in every previous edition, was omitted by Dindorf as a gloss:
surely a very unreasonable pro- ceeding.
Yet he is followed by Fritzsche.
Meineke, Holden, and others ;
and those who do not omit the line enclose it in brackets.
265. με δέηΡ. Brunck, Invernizzi, Bothe, Fritzsche, Kock, Green.
Cobet suggests the omission of με, which is found in every MS., and Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen omit it accordingly.
με δῆ R. V. Dindorf, and such recent editors as are not mentioned above, με δεȋ M. U. most of the other MSS.
and the editions before Brunck.
For κἂν Blaydes always writes κἢν, which it will suffice to men- tion here once for all.
271. Ξανθίας.
For the final Ξανθίας V. has Ξανθία, and so Fritzsche, Bergk, Meineke, Paley, Kock, Velsen, and Van Leeuwen.279.
τὰ δείν᾽ ἒφαϭκ᾽ ἐκεῖος. Hamaker, without any authority or probability, alters this into εἰναι rὰ δεῖν᾽ ἒφαϭκεν, and this depravation of the text is followed by Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.285.
νὴ τὸν Δία.
Here again Hamaker distinguishes himself.
Not perceiving that these words constitute an ironical assent by Xanthias to his master's vaunt, and recognizing that the words
Kat μὴν ought to commence a sentence, he actu- ally proposes to destroy the whole humour of the line by reading καὶ μὴν ψόφου νὴ τὸν
Δἴ αίσθάνομαί τινοςΑnd, what is still more astonishing, this unhappy line is by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen foisted into the text, as the genuine handiwork of Aristophanes.286.
που̑που̑ ’στιν ;
The line is written in the text as it appears in R., except that R. concludes it with έξόπισθεν ἲθι.
The obvious correction έξόπισθ’ ἲθι was made by Dobree, and the line is so read by Bekker, Dindorf, Fritzsche, Bergk, Meineke, Paley, Velsen, recentiores.π
ου̑ που̑;
’ξόπισθεν. έξόπισθεν νυ̑ν ἲοιU. and (save that he reads έξόπισθέ νυν) Kock and (with έξόπισθεν οὗν) Holden.

ring the changes on the readings of R. U. and W.290.
τότε ... τότε R. V. V2. W. F1. F2. FS. H. Bergk, Holden, Paley, Velsen, Van Leeuwen.
The editions before Brunck and Bekker, Fritzsche, Kock, and Blaydes afterwards write it τοτὲ ... τοτὲ, but this is contrary to all the MSS., and there seems no sufficient ground for the notion that τότε when used in this collo- cation changes its accent, wore ... ποτὲ the other MSS.
and editions.298. άπολύμεθ'.
By an obvious, but interesting, error, P. U. P3 and the older editions attribute this and (with the exception of P.) the next speech of Xanthias to the priest of Dionysus.
The dialogue in this part of the play is variously distributed, but the common arrangement is that given in the text.305.
νὴ τὸν Δία.
All editions before Kuster omitted the τὸν, so making the line a syllable short.
Bentley therefore at first proposed to read μοι after κατό- μοσον ;
but subsequently finding that some MS.
had τὸν Δία, preferred that reading to his own conjecture.
And this is now supported by R. V. P. M. U. and all the best MSS.
and so all recent editors.307, 308.
οἲμοι τάλας K.r.X.
These two lines are rightly continued to Xanthias in R., though, as it reads σου, little weight can be laid on that circumstance.
As a rule, the first line is given to Dionysus, of whom the words αὺτὴν ίγών would be untrue.
R. is the only MS.
which reads σου. μου is found in P. M. U. F1. F3. F4. H. and others and in almost all the editions.
V. has που.311. αὶθέακ.τ.λ.
This line is given to Xanthias by R. V. P3. O. C. C1. and the older editions, but is continued to Dionysus by P. U. P2- P5. and most recent editions.
The stage-direction which follows is found in R. Y. M. and other MSS.
and in the older editions;
and I do not know why recent editors have omitted all these παρεπιγρααὶ, some of which are of great value.
In the distribution of the next two lines I have followed the best MSS., but in many MSS.
and editions the parts of Dionysus and Xanthias are interchanged.
315.
ήρεμεὶ P. U. V1. W1. F4. and (by a corrector) R., all editions before Brunck ;

except Y. U. άγνὴν R. Y. V1. P. P3.
And so most, but not all, of the early editions.
Recent editors mostly read τὰν, τιμὰν, άγνὰν.
But there is no sufficient reason for deserting the read- ing of all the best MSS.
Aristophanes throws in an occasional Doricism, such as ἤβαν in 353 infra, but he never keeps strictly to an un-Attic dialect, as the tragedians do.
For τιμὴν Bentley con- jectured and Kock reads r' έμὰν.336.
όσίοις ̋Αμα μύσταισι χσρείαν.
The common reading is ίερὰν‘Οσίοις μύασταις χορείαν but R. V. P. M. U. and all the best MSS.
have μύσταισι.
Fritzsche con- siders ίερὰν a gloss on άκόλαστον or ὰγνὴν, and therefore omits it, promoting όσίοις to its vacant place, and making the final line ἂμα μύστισι χορείαν, two Ionics a minore, in exact correspondence with the final line of the antistrophe χορπὸν, μάκαρ, ἤβαν.
And this suggestion (with the substitution of μετὰ for ἂμα) is adopted by Kock, Meineke, Holden, Vel- sen, and Van Leeuwen.
But of the two prepositions I much prefer ἂμα, as more suitable in itself, and more likely to have dropped out after ὰγνήν.340.
έγίρου. ἔγειρεΜSS. vulgo.
The error seems to have arisen from a notion that the verb was to be connected with φλαγέας λαμπάγας, which are in truth governed by τινσσων.
Fritzsche sup- poses, " ἔγειρ' pro έγείρου positum esse, sicut in Eur. Iph. A. 624, et alibi."
Bergk says Forte έγείρου praestat," and so Blaydes.
Moreover (though much weight cannot be laid upon this) έγείρου brings the commencement of the anti strophe into exact correspondence with the commencement of the strophe.
341. έν χερσίτινάσσων.
As observed in the Commentary, there seems to have been a marginal gloss ̉"Ιακχοςγὰρ ἤκει, signifying that the statue of Iacchus is here brought out of the temple ;
and the last two words yap ἤκει crept into the text between χερσὶand τιάσων, to the utter confusion of both sense and metre.
For all the MSS.
and the editions before Dindorf's read έν χερσὶγὰρ κει (or η̃κεις,which is merely an attempt to get some sense out of the interpolation) τινάσσων.
Hermann was the first to eject the intruder, and he is followed by Din- dorf, Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, Van Leeu- wen.
Bergk makes confusion worse confounded by retaining γὰρ ἤκει and omitting τιάσσων.
Nobody seems to have noticed whence the objectionable γὰρ ἤκει must have been derived.344.
φλέγεται δὴ φλογὶ Hermann, Fritzsche, Holden, Kock, Velsen, so making two Ionics, in correspondence with the όσίους eg θιασώτας of the strophe.
φλογὶ φλέγεται δὲ V. P. U. F1. F4. F5. P3. and others.
φλογὶ φέγγεται δὲ R. P2. P5. W. W1, V1. and others and vulgo.347. χρονίους έτω̑ν, πααιούς τ’ ένιαυτοὺς.
The reading of this line is extremely doubtful.
The MS.
readings are χρο- F2. F3. F4. P2 P5. V2, H. W. W1. and all editions before Invernizzi.
χράνους T' έτω̑ν tiores, except Velsen, and except that Bothe reads έτέων.
It will be observed that all the MSS.
have έτω̑ν, and the collocation έτω̑νένιαυτοὺς is twice recog- nized by Eustathius.
ένιαυτὰς γου̑ν χρόν
ος ἐνιαυταύς.
And again, on Odyssey, i. 16, after giving the same explanation of ένιαυτὰς, he adds διὸ καὶ ὸ Κωμικὸς έπιθετι- κω̑ς αύτὰ τὶθησιν έν τῳ̑έτω̑ν χρονίους ένιαυ- ταύς.
It seems, however, impossible that έτω̑ν ένιαυταὺς can be right, especially as έτω̑ν does not suit the metre, which requires an Ionic a minore in the first place, answering to the στέφανον μύρτ- of the strophe.
Dawes therefore pro- posed άτω̑ν, translating exeutit (άπασείεται) dolores diuturnarum noxarum, senilesque annos.
Reiske proposed γυίων or γαύνων, Kock άστω̑ν, whilst Velsen reads κράτων-
None of these suggestions are satisfac- tory, and it seems more probable, that έτω̑ν is a mere gloss on γήρως, which, however, I have not ventured to intro- duce into the text.

φέγγν.
The MSS.
and all the editions before Dindorf have φλγων, and so Kock :
but the metre requires a spondee.
Bothe has φλξων ;
Blaydes and Van Leeuwen φαίνων.
But far better than either of these is Hermann's φέγγων, which is adopted by Dindorf and (save as aforesaid) all subsequent editors.351. ἓξαγ' έπ' άνθηρὰν all the MSS.
except B., which without changing a letter makes a complete change in the sense, ἓξαγε πανθηαν.
The latter reading is found in all editions before Bergler ;
the former in Bergler and all subsequent editions.355.
νγώμῃ μὴ καθαρεύει. γνώμῃ (or γνώμη) R. V. P. M. U. P3. F*. C1. and all editions except Bothe, Meineke, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen, who with B. O. C. L. L1. and P4. read γνώμην.
καθαρεύει U. P3. F4. Zanetti, Neobari, Farreus, Bergler, and all subsequent editors.
καθαρεύοι the other MSS.
and the other editions before Bergler.366.
Ἑκαταίων.
See Appendix to Wasps on line 804.
Here, as there, some alter the MS.
spelling to Ἑκατείων.
At the end of the line, for ὑπά̣δων, the reading of V. P. M. U. and most of the MSS.
and all the editions, R. P2. P3. P5. have ἐπᾴ̣δων.369. τοισίδ᾽ ἀπαυδῶ Person, Meineke. τοῖσιν Bentley.
All the editions before Brunck have τούτοισιν ἀπαυδῶ καὖθις ἀπαυδῶ καὖθις μάλ’ ἀπαυδῶ.
It is un- known where Aldus got this unmetrical line, which is not found in any existing MS.
Aulus Gellius, in the preface to his Nodes Atticae, quotes the first and last three of these long Aristophanics, and he reads the present line thus, τούτοις αὐδῶ καὖθις ἀπαυδῶ καὖθις τὸ τρίτον μάλ’ ἀπαυδῶ, and this, which is also the reading of V. (except that V. omits the τὸ before τρίτον), is adopted by Brunck and subsequent editors before Meineke.
Meier's suggestion τοῦτον ἀπαυδῶ is adopted by Holden, and Valckenaer's οἷσιν ἀπαυδῶ by Kock and Velsen.
Blaydes alters the whole line into τούτοις πρωυδῶ καὖθις πρωυδῶ καὖθις TO τρίτον μάλα πρωυδῶ, and Van Leeuwen follows him.
The other MS.
variations for τοισίδ’ ἀπαυδῶ are τουτοις ἀπαυδῶ R. M. U. and the bulk of the MSS., and τουτοις μὲν ἀπαυδῶ
P. It will be observed that V. is the only MS.
which has not the triple ἀπαυδῶ, which is undoubtedly the correct reading;
and thus the first word must be the equivalent of the MS.
τούτοις, and nothing seems so probable as Porson's emendation-372.
χώρει νῦν.
All the best MSS.
and all editions before Dindorf read χώρει δὴ νῦν.
Bentley wrote "dele δὴ et lege νυν encliticum," and so Dindorf, recentiores.
But although the omission of δὴ is required by the metre, we should retain νῦν, which is intended as a mark of time.
The procession has been sifted, and a new stage commences.
Now, νῦν, they are to begin the march, which they could not do before.
So when the processional hymn to Perse- phone is over, they begin the new stage ἄγε νῦν ἑτέραν κ.τ.λ. 381 infra.
So with the third and final stages respectively, 395 and 441.
Every editor, I believe, writes in some of these places νυν, and in others vûv, but clearly all come within the same category.
The Chorus have been doing one thing :
now they are to begin another.
And with this all the MSS.
are in accord.374. λειμώνων.
So all the MSS.
except P. M. and m., and all the editions except Junta, Gormont, Neobari, Gry- naeus, and Brunck.
M. reads τῶν καθ᾽ ᾅδου λειμώνων corrected into τῶν λειμώνων, and this corrected reading is found in Grynaeus.
P. and m. read τῶν καθ᾽ ̩α̩̋δου λειμώνων, and so Junta, Gormont, Neo- bari, and Brunck, contrary alike to the sense and to the metre.375.
κἀπισκώπτων R. V. Invernizzi, recentiores.
καὶ σκώπτων the other MSS.
and the editions before Invernizzi.378.
ἀρεῖς, Scaliger's suggestion in the edition which bears his name, was first introduced into the text by Bekker, and has since been universally followed, except by Bothe and Velsen.
αἴρεις editions before Portus, and so R. U. Ps. F4. F5. and Invernizzi. αἴρῃς (or αἴρης) M. and the bulk of the MSS.
Portus, and the subsequent editions before Invernizzzi, and Bothe.
αἰρήσεις V. αἴροις P. Velsen adopts Hamaker's con- jecture ἄρξει.380.
σώζειν MSS. vulgo, except that V. has σώσει, whence, on Cobet's sug- gestion, σώσειν is substituted by Meineke, Holden, Paley, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.382.
ἄγε νῦν έτέραν.
Some MSS.
and some editions prefix ἡμιχόριον or ἱερεὺς to this and the other exhortations of the like character :
but, of course, the lines are really spoken by the Coryphaeus.
Others consequently prefix KOP., but these, to be logical, should give the same prefix to all utterances of the Chorus except the choral songs.
It is better to leave these distinctions to the reader's own intelligence.394.
ἀλλ᾽ εἶα Bentley, Fritzsche, Meineke ,Holden, Paley, V elsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
ἄγ᾽ εἶα MSS. vulgo.
ἀλλ᾽ εἶα seems the right formula for proposing a change (cf. Thesm.
985, Plutus 316), and it harmonizes metric- ally with χωρεῖτε, infra 440.397.
χορείας. πορείας Velsen. 398. μέλος MSS. vulgo, and this is unquestionably right:
but Kock sug- gests μέρας, and Meineke reads τέλος, and so Holden, V elsen, and Van Leeuwen.414.
μετ᾽ αὐτῆς.
It seems probable that this and the following line were intended to be symmetrical, and there- fore the words μετ᾽ αὐτῆς are omitted by Meineke, Holden, Velsen, and Van Leeuwen, and bracketed by Kock and Blaydes. " Hotibius" would transfer them to the next verse in the place of χορεύειν,with παίζειν for παίζων.
Fritzsche, on the other hand, would lengthen the second line by making the speech of Xanthias run πρὸς δὲ Kav ἔγωγε, and substituting τις ὢν for εἰμι καὶ in the first.
A simpler process would be to leave the first line as it stands,, and insert βούλομαι between ye and itρός· in the second.430.
κύσθου MSS.
Bergler, recentiores, except as mentioned below.
In all editions before Bergler the word was spelt κίσθου. Bothe's suggestion κύσθω̩ is adopted by Fritzsche, Meineke, and Kock.432.
Πλούτων R. V. P. U. and the great bulk of the MSS.
and all editions before Brunck.
Πλούτων᾽ M. V1. P4. O. C. Brunck, recentiores.
But when both readings are equally good, there seems no reason for departing from all the best MSS.437.

After ὦ παῖ R. P. M. U. add τὰ στρώματα it mere gloss, as indeed appears from V. where it still remains in its proper place in the margin, as τὰ στρώματα στρώμστσ.
The true reading is found in V. and the other MSS.
and is followed by Bekker, recentiores, except Bothe who with Brunck and Invernizzi retains the gloss in the text.
Of the editions before Brunck the words τά γε στρώματα are added to ὦ παι by Junta, Gormont, and Neobari;
whilst Aldus and the others give the whole line as αἴροις ἂν αὖθις αὖ γε παῖ τὰ στρώματα.439.

Μαῖραι MSS. vulgo.
Bergler in his Latin version translated this Home, and Brunck in his revision left this translation unaltered.
Meineke suggest- ed Ὦραι or Μοῦσαι, and Van Leeuwen reads Ὦραἰ, observing " vocem traditam damnat adjectivum ὄλβιαι, almae, beatae, quod de Horis aptissimum, de Musis aptum, de Parcis ineptum."
But as to this, see the Commentary.455.

γεύσει Bekker and (except as above) recentiores.
But though the future is common enough in sentences of this kind, and occurs in 202, 203 and 524, 525 of this very play, yet the impera- tive is also found, as in Clouds 296, 297:
and there seems no reason for departing from the unanimous reading of the MSS.482.
σπογγιάν MSS.
vulgo.
But some recent editors prefer to spell it σφογγιάν.483.
πρόσθου MSS. vulgo.
προσθοῦ Bergk and subsequent editors.
But this is a mistake.
The right accentuation is πρόσθου.
The author of the Etym.
Magn., s. v. πρ
οοῦ (not observing that προοῦ if so accented is an exceptional case), lays down the rule in terms con- tradicted by the very examples which he brings to support it.
The true rule in regard to the second aorist imperative middle of verbs in μι is that "where the simple verb is monosyllabic, so that if the accent is thrown back it will fall on the prefix, it is so thrown back :
but where the simple verb is polysyllabic, so that the accent, if thrown back, will still fall on the verb, it is not thrown back."
No compound of ξοῦ retains the circumflex.
The MSS.
give πρόσθου here, Birds 361, Soph. Trach. 1224;
ἒνθου Knights 51 ;
σύνθου, ὸπόθου, κατάθου, Etym. Magn. ubi supra, cf. infra 528, 627;
περίθου, ὺπάθου, παράθου, Eccl. 131, 1031, 1033, and so on.
In the Etym.
Magn.
the rule, which applies to the syllables of the verb, is absurdly referred to the syllables of the prefix itself.
Mr. Chandler in his learned work on Greek accentuation (§ 819 Compound verbs in μι) while apparently adopting what he calls the "singular rule" of the Etym.
Magn. mentions, as an ex- ception, “περιδοῦ in Eccl. 121, for which the correct form περίδου occurs in the same author in Clouds 644, Ach. 772." But this is an oversight.
The περιδοῦ in Eccl. 121 comes from περιδέω, and is not a compound verb in μι at all;
the περίδου in Clouds 644 and Ach.
772 comes from περιδίδωμι, and is subject to the rule we are considering.
All three words are rightly accented.494.
ληματιᾲς MSS. vulgo.
The Scho- liast mentions a various reading ληματίας in the sense of μεγαλόφρων καὶ ὶσχυρὰς, and V. has it as a marginal reading.
Photius explains ληματίας by φρανηματίας, γεννάδας, without any reference to Ari- stophanes, and Suidas incorporates in his Lexicon the explanations of both Photius and the Scholiast.
Hesychius has ληματίαν φρανηματίαν, which (being in the accusative) is clearly a. reference to some other place in which the word occurs.
It is not at all in the manner of Aristophanes to join together two epithets of almost precisely the same meaning.
Yet ληματίας is forced into the text in defiance of all the MSS.
by Meineke, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.505.
κατερικτῶν R. V. V1. F2. F5. and all the editions from Aldus downwards, except Meineke, Holden, Rock, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen, who with M. P. U. and the remaining MSS.
spell the word κατερεικτῶν.507.
κολλάβαυς.
Blaydes adds a τ’to this word.508.
au μή σ’.
The οὺιs omitted by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen, because, they say, after αὺ μὴ "non futurum sed subjunctivus aoristi debebatsequi."
But the μὴ cannot stand alone.
Nor is Blaydes more happy in suggesting ἄδειπναν ὄντ’ or πεινῶντ’for άπελθάντ’, though he introduces the first, and Van Leeuwen the second, conjecture into the text.513.
αὺλητρίς γέ R. M. P. U. aud most MSS. and vulgo.
αὺλητρίς τέ V. Blaydes.514. ἤδη ’νδον Tyrwhitt, Dobree, Din- dorf, Fritzsche, recentiores. ἤδ’ ἕνδον MSS. vulgo.519.

And this the context requires.
ὰρχηστρίσι is also found in V. and 0. and is read by Brunck.
αὺλητρίσι M. P. U. vulgo.522. παιεῖ V. Dindorf, Fritzsche, re- centiores.

But the middle is almost always employed in this connexion.
523.
‛Ηρακλέα γ’ὲσκεύασα P. U. W. W1. W2. F2. F3. F*. H. V2. and all edi- tions before Dindorf.
‛Ηρακλέα yὲσκεύ- ακα V. Thiersch. ‛Ηρακλέ' έσκεύασα R. ‛Ηρακλέα σκεύασαΜ. V1. ‛Ηρὰκλέα σ’ ὲσκεύασα O. Elmsley at Ach. 385, where the word ὲνσκευάσασθαι occurs, says casually “ Confer Ranae 523 ubi fortasse legendum est ‛Ηρακλέα ’νεσκεύασα.
”And this hesitating suggestion is adopted by Dindorf, Fritzsche, and subsequent editors.
It is difficult to say why, for as Blaydes, while adopting it, truly ob- serves, " Multo frequentius in hoc sensu est simplex σκευάζειν quam ένσκευάζειν."543.
κυνῶν R. V. Bentley, Bekker, re- centiores.

But cf.
Thesm.
633.545. οὗτος ... αὐτὰς.
The proximity of these two pronouns has caused some confusion in the MSS., R. V. O. and some others reading αὐτὸς for οὗτος, and omitting αὐτὸς before πανοῦργος.
How- ever the great bulk of MSS.
and edi- tions give the line as in the text.
Velsen substitutes ἀεὶ for αὐτὸς.
Blaydes, fol- lowed as usual by Van Leeuwen, for αὐτὸς πανοῦργος reads πανοῦργος εὐθὺς.
Bergk changes αὐτὸς into καὐτὸς, and is followed by Meineke.551. κατέφαγ' V. Bentley, Dindorf, re- centiores.

The τοῖς after αὐτοῖς is omitted by R. P. M. and a few other MSS.—κατήσθιεν R. V. P. P3. κατήσθιε M. U. P4. P5.
At its first appearance in Aldus the line ran ὄνπερ σὺν αὐτοῖσι ταλάροις κατήσθιε.
This went on till Portus added τοῖς between aὐτοῖσι and ταλάροις :
and so it was read till Kuster changed αὐτοῖαι into αὐτοῖς.
Next, Brunck from P. changed ὄνπερ σὺν into ὃν αὐτὸς, whilst Invernizzi from R. V. changed αὐτὸς, into οὗτος.Finally Bekker from the same MSS.
added the ν to κατήσθιε, and brought the line into its present form.562.

But as Fritzsche truly says "Hujus versus numeri non tragici esse debent sed comici."
And see infra at 673.576.
χόλικας Schweighaeuser, Din- dorf, recentiores.
κόλικας MSS.
editions before Dindorf.
κόλικας is a vox nihili, and must represent either κόλλικας muffins or χόλικας tripe ;
ἦ ἄρτους ἦ ἔντερα, as the Scholiast explains it.
But the first two syllables'
Of κόλλικας are long, and κόλικας therefore must be either another form of, or a mistake for, χόλικας ;
which is now universally substituted for it.
582.
ὦ Ξανθίδιον.
On the supposition that the second syllable of the word (if derived from Ξανθίας) would be long, Meineke would either omit the ὦ or read ὦ Ξάνθιον.
But there is no cer- tainty about these pet names.584.
θυμοῖ R. V. M. U. and the MSS.
generally, Junta, Brunck, recentiores.
θυμεῖ P. P2. P5. and, with the exception of Junta, all editions before Brunck.592.
σαυτὸν ἀεὶ W. W1 W2. H. F3. and all the editions before Invernizzi, and Bothe afterwards.
The words are omitted in all the other MSS.
and by Invernizzi and subsequent editors, most of whom mark a lacuna.
No MS.
sub- stitutes any words in their place.
Fritzsche inserts (in brackets) πρὸς τὺ γαυ̂ρον ;
Meineke (without brackets) πρὸς τὸ σοβαρὸν, Van Leeuwen σοβαρὸν own.595.
κἀκβαλείς Fritzsche, recentiores, after Hermann's certain emendation.
κἀκβάληις V. καὶ βάληις (or βάλῃς) R. P. V. and most of the MSS.
and the older editions.
καὶ βαλεῖς V1. W1. W2. Invernizzi, Dindorf. καὶ βάλλεις M.596. 'σται πάλιν. 'στι πάλιν (contra metrum) V. AlduR, Gelenius, Portus, Scaliger, Faber, Kuster, Bergler, and Bekker.
This was corrected into 'στιν πάλιν by Bentley, who is followed by Dindorf, Fritzsche, and Paley.
Dawes commenting on Frogs 437 quotes the line as 'σται πάλιν (without professing to amend it), and this is followed by Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.
There is little to choose between 'στιν and 'σται, but on the whole I prefer the latter.
R. P. M. V. and the MSS.
generally have πάλιν alone.
H. W. W1. P2. P5. F3. have τις πάλ ιν, and so Junta and (except as aforesaid) the editions before Fritzsche.
This is probably a mere re- arrangement of the letters in 'στι, to save the metre.
611, 612.
These two verses are vari- ously distributed :
but the arrangement in the text is commonly adopted and seems correct.618.
βασανίσω V. P3. C. C1. Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Paley, Van Leeuwen. βασανίζω the other MSS. and editions.620.
ἒτι δ’ ἐς τὰς.
All the editions before Brunck had ἐπί τε τὰς, and that is the reading of P. M. U. and almost all the MSS. ;
but Dawes corrected it, as in the text, from Suidas, and his correction is confirmed by R. V. and followed by Brunck and all subsequent editors.625.
ἒμοιγ̕ οὔτω vulgo.
ἐμέ γε, τοῦτον P. U. P5. F*., a curious variation, which is recognized by the Scholiast, and apparently arose from a notion that Dionysus is speaking.
And this is followed by αὐτὸν for αὐτοῦ at the begin- ning of the next line.
630.
σεαυτὸν R. P. U. and other MSS.
Invernizzi, recentiores.
σὺ σαυτὸν H. F3. editions before Invernizzi. ἑαυτὸν V. B. σαυτὸν (without σὺ) M. O. V1. W1. F2644. ἰδοὺ. All the MSS.
except Ps. and almost all the editions continue the entire line to Xanthias, as in the text.
A few editions, not understanding the passage, follow P3. in giving ἰδοὺ to Aeacus.649.
τί τἀτταῑ.
The variations in this speech are as numerous as they are un- important.
The reading in the text is that of V. Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, and Paley.
All the editions before Brunck give as the retort of Aeacus τί δὴταταῑ.
Brunck from P6. changed this into TL If ἰατταταῑ, and so H. F3.
R. runs both exclamations into one, ἰατταττατταττατ- ατταῖ which is probable enough, and is adopted by Invernizzi and Fritzsche, and, except that they divide the word into a twice repeated ἰατταταῖ, by Dobree, Meineke, Holden, and Velsen.
ἀνύσεις TI ;
ἀτταταῖ.
A1A. τίτἀτταταῖ;
Kock, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
There are some other minor variations.664.
ἥλγησέν τις R. P. U. Dindorf, re- centiores.
ἥλγησέ τις V. M. editions before Dindorf.
Dindorf suggests that the words ἁλὸς ἐν βένθεσιν should be brought up here to complete the sena- rius, and Van Leeuwen brings them up accordingly.665. [ἔχεις].
This word is not in the MSS., but without it there is nothing to govern π ρῶνας.
Bergler suggests that ἔχεις may be understood from 659, but this seems impossible ;
Scaliger proposed and Van Leeuwen reads πρωυὸς, to be governed by μέδεις.
Bergk proposed to read ἂς Αἰγαίαυς ἔχεις πρῶνας, and Velsen and Blaydes insert ἔχεις after πρῶνας.
the former as part of the undisputed text, the latter in brackets.
I too have inserted it in brackets, though rather to make sense than as thinking it was really inserted by Aristophanes.
It seems to me that Dionysus in his agony is putting together some lyrical language without regard to the gram- matical construction.
673.

ἐπὶ βάρβαρ

So all the MSS.
and all the editions before Meineke, though it was his predecessor Bergk who in an evil hour threw open the floodgates of unwise conjecture by suggesting ἐπὶ ϐάρβαρ
ον ἡδομένη̣ πίτυλον. Cf. Peace 800 and the note there.
Bergk, however, left the text unaltered ;
but Meineke introduces into the text his conjecture ὑποβάρβαραν ἑζυμένη κέλαδαν, in which he is followed by Holden, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
Velsen again reads ἐπὶ βαρβάρῳ ἡδαμένη κελάδῳ.
The MS.
reading is far superior to any of these corruptions.683.
κελαδέῖ V. P. M. U. and the MSS.
generally, and all the editions before Dindorf.
κελαρύζει R. B. 0. L1. Bothe. ῥύζει (snarls like a dog) Dindorf, Meineke, Holden, Green, Merry. τρύζει (a word constantly used of the nightingale) Fritzsche, Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.
Blaydes says " Verum videtur aut κελαδεῖ aut τρύζει."
κρίζει, Seidler.
κελαδεῖ is retained by Bergk and Paley.
Nobody raises any objection to κελαδεῖ, which is used of the nightingale's song in Peace 801, and well suits the light- ness and airiness of the present ode.
Probably some grammarian wrote τρύζει in the margin, and the two words coalesced into the κελαρύζει of R.703.
εἰ δὲ ταυ̑τ’ R. V. P. M. and the MSS. and editions generally.
εί δὲ του̑τ’ U. and a few other MSS.
Brunck, Invernizzi, Dindorf, Bother Bergk, Meineke, Holden.
Non temere sollici- tanda optimorum librum scriptura, says Blaydes;
an excellent aphorism often disregarded.
In the next line I, with some other editors, place a comma after πόλιν, πάλιν being understood after ἔχον- τες.
I do not believe that τὴν πόλιν καὶ ταυ̑τ’ ἒχαντες κ.τ.λ. is good Greek for And that too having the city, &c.
The examples adduced to justify this position of καὶ ταυ̑τα are mostly very wide of the mark.
Καὶ ταυ̑τα in this sense must either introduce the subsentence, or follow immediately after the special circum- stance which it adds to the preceding statement.

The ye is omitted in the other MSS.
Hermann proposed πολλάκις δ’, an impossible read- ing, since an Epirrhema or Antepirrhema recited by the Coryphaeus never is, or could be, hooked on by a conjunctive particle to a Strophe or Antistrophe sung by the Chorus.
Nevertheless, this error is adopted by Fritzsche, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.719.
καλαύςτε κἀγαθσύς.
So all the MSS.
(except C. and L. which read κακούς re κἀγαθαὺς) and all the editions before Holden.
Meineke, however, sharing the general impression that the next line speaks of a bad as well as of a good coinage, concluded that the present line must mention bad as well as good citizens;
a very unwarrantable con- clusion, for it is by no means necessary that one branch of a comparison should embrace every derail comprised in the other.
However, the suggestion was sufficient to set the conjecturers to work.
Meineke himself (Vind. Aristoph.) would read κακαύς TIE κἀγαθοὺς, and Holden and Kock so read.
But if οὶ κακοί TIE κἀγαθοὶ.
could ever, in Ari- stophanes, mean the evil and the good, it could only be where the two are fused into one class, and not where, as here, the two classes are being distinguished from, and contrasted with, each other.
Thus Solon (Polity of Athens, chap. 12) says θεσμοὺς δ’ ομοίους τω̜̑ κακω̜̑ τε κὰγαθω̜̑ ἔγραψα, "I made equal laws for. all citizens."
In the Funeral Oration of we should probably with some MSS.
read καλω̑ν.
But if not, the speaker is blending together, not distinguishing between, the two.
To my mind, how- ever, in Aristophanes, the words could only be a parody on his favourite καλοί
Tf κἀγαθαὶ, arid would mean virtuous villains.
Velsen introduces a really horrible doggrel of his own ταὺς καλοὺς καὶ row κακαὺς into a trochaic tetra- meter, perhaps the most harmonious of all metres, and even more harmonious in the hands of Aristophanes than in those of the Tragic Poets.
But some scholars, provided they can get the proper number of syllables into a line, entirely ignore the melody of the verse (as witness Bergk's dreadful -σω ’γὼ σφὼ in 1480 infra), a consideration which Aristophanes never ignored.
Moreover, in composing his doggrel, Velsen over- looks the fact that the adjective καλὸς in Aristophanes never includes any refer- ence to moral virtue, and that οἱ καλοὶ καὶ ot κακαὶ on his lips could mean nothing but "the beautiful and the wicked."
This again shows the absurdity or a still older conjecture by Duker τοὺς καλούς τε κοὐ ’γαθούς.
Other conjectures have been made, which are not worth repeating here.
And, of course, if the view taken of this Antepirrhema in the Commentary be correct, all excuse for these alterations at once disappears.720.
καὶ τὸ καινὸν χρυσίον.
For the reasons mentioned in relation to the foregoing line, Kuster proposed to read καὶ τὸ καινὸν χαλκί
ον.
And Meineke actually substitutes for the text the words Kat καλω̑ς κεκομμένον.
This was his first mode of equalizing the two branches of the comparison.
After- wards, in his Vind. Aristoph., he aban- doned it for the alteration in the preceding line, already considered.724.
ἕν τε τοι̑ς.
From the strange notion that this line is governed by χρώμεθ’ οὐδἐν, in which case we should expect οὕτ’ ἐν τοι̑ς "Ελλησι, various transpositions have been made in these verses by Meineke and other recent editors.
But the words are really, as Holden observes, connected with κεκω- δωνισμένοις, tested both amongst the Hellenes and amongst the Barbarians.730.
πρ
ουσελου̑μεν R. Bekker, recen- tiores, except Bergk. προσλου̑μεν the MSS.

Dawes considered that the προσ- was long, because followed by the digamma, and accordingly Brunck and Bergk write it προσε̒λου̑μεν.
Stobaeus, 43. 28, citing this passage gives προυελου̑μεν, and so Bentley proposed, Hesychius explaining προυγελει̑ν by προπηλακίζειν and ὑβρίζειν.
Grotius proposed προυξε- λω̑μεν.
There is the same difficulty in Aesch.
Prom. 447.
Meineke is thoroughly dissatisfied with the way in which Aristophanes wrote this Antepirrhema, and sets to work with great zeal to improve it.
Some of his alterations have already been noticed.
Here he would change χαλκοι̑ς into μαλακοι̑ς, so striking out the very analogy on which Aristophanes is insisting between the pinchbeck coin and the pinchbeck citi- zens.
Two lines below he would alter υ̒στότοις ἀφιγμένουσιν into υ̒στέροις ἀφι- γμένοισιν, meaning that the spurious citizens arrived later than the genuine.
But the genuine citizens, in their own opinion, never arrived at all:
they were Autochthons, native children of the ground:
and Aristophanes is laying stress on the fact that the people employ the newest comers, the very latest arrivals.
In 731 he would alter εἰς ἅπαντα into οὐσι πάντο, and in 734 καὶ vvv into κἀν νυ̑ν.741.

Fritzsche and Holden continue the whole of the next line to Xanthias, though he could have known nothing of Aeschylus and Euri- pides :
whilst Meineke postpones it to lines 759, 760, and makes it the last line of the speech of Aeacus.
There is no ground for these changes.
The MS.
arrangement is far better.

The μέγα which concludes the line is found in almost all the MSS.

One πρα̑γμα is omitted, doubtless by an over- sight, by Portus and Kuster.762.

Meineke destroys the liveliness of the line by changing p.av- θάνω into μανθάνεις ;
and giving the word to Aeacus.
Xanthias, of course, means that he quite understands what Aeacus is saying about the dinner, and precedence, in the Prytanenm, since such things are as well known in Athens as in Hades.771.

Rapheleng restored ὀδἀντα, but the error of Gelenius was reintroduced by Portus and subsequent editors down to Bergler, who again restored the true reading.
Brunck in his note says that P3. and P6- have ὀξύλαλον ... öðávT'aS' which he retains and approves, explaining, strangely enough, that " ὀξύλαλον sub- stantive accipiendum est pro τὸ ὀξύλαλον GARRULITAS" ;
but in a supplemental note he says that P3. has ὀξυλάλον which he prefers.
Bekker went back to the old error of Gelenius, whilst Dindorf and Merry adopt Brunck's final proposition and read ὀξυλάλον ὀδάντα.
The MS.

Bentley, Fritzsche, Bergk, Meineke, Kock, Paley, Merry. σκινδάλμων(or -μῶν) R. P. M. U. and the bulk of the MSS., and all editions before Brunck.
Brunck unfortunately introduced the question of dialect, quo- ting from Moeris σχινδαλμὰς ἐν τῷ χ, ᾽Αττικῶςσκινδαλὰς, "Ελληνες.
In the notes on Moeris, Sallier, observing that in Aristophanes (here and Clouds 130) and other writers of pure Attic;
all MSS.
commence the word with σκ-, sug- gests that in Moeris the two forms should be transposed, whilst Hudson and Pierson, with even less reason, would alter the spelling in Aristophanes.
This latter view was adopted by Brunck, who accordingly wrote σχινδαλμῶνhere.
Person saw, as Bentley had seen before him, that the line should commence with a dactyl, and for that reason (and not as pronouncing any opinion as to the right spelling of the word) changed Brunck's σχινδαμῶν into σχινδαλάμων.
And σχινδαλάμων is read by Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen, But of course when Moeris says that one form is used ᾽Αττικῶς, and the other ῾Ελληνικῶς, he does not mean to exclude from the Hellenic form the principal Hellenic writers, the poets, philosophers, and historians of Athens.
He means that the first form is used by the Athenians, only, the second by the Athenians in common with the other Hellenic peoples.
To give one example out of five hundred, he says θύραζε,᾽Αττικῶς.
ἔξω, ῾Ελληνικῶς, yet of course both forms are quite common with Attic writers.
Much mischief has been done by critics not bearing in mind that ῾Ελληνικῶς does not mean un-Attic.
For παραξόνια (from ἂξων, whirling of splinters) which im- mediately follows, Herwerden suggests παραξάανα (from ξέω,scrapings of splinters).827.

We should certainly have expected ἂνand Dawes referring to (amongst other passages) 672 supra, Eccl. 151, Wasps 960, proposes either ἐβουλόμηνμἐνἂν, which Brunck accepts, or ἐβουλόμηνἂν.
It seems, however, impossible to make any change in the face of such passages as the commencement of Antiphon's speech, "In the matter of the murder of Herodes," where efiovXo/jLTjv /iIJ, without ἂν, is used exactly as here.
At the end of the line, ἐνθάδε is altered by Meineke, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen into ἐνθαδί867.
ἁγὼν νῷν.
The old editions read ἀγὼν νῶἵν, but Bentley and Dawes saw that ἀγὼν required the article, ἁγὼν, and that νῷν must consequently be read as a monosyllable.
The latter alteration is confirmed by every MS.;
and therefore ἀγὼνwhich is found in most MSS., becomes unmetrical, and the former alteration becomes necessary on this ground aIM.
The double alteration was accepted by Brunck, and all subsequent editors.—τί δαἱ ;

Parson objects to an anapaest in the fourth place (Suppl. Pref. Hec.) and Bp. Monk on Hipp. 377 contracts the word to ἱππαλεκτρύω.
Bothe changes it to ἱππα- λεκτόρα, and (what is more surprising) is followed in this by Fritzsche, Meineke, Holden ,Kock, Velsen ,and Van Leeuwen.
However sparingly Aristophanes uses an anapaest in this place, he certainly does so on certain occasions ;
the form ἀλεκτρυόνα is necessary in 935 infra;
it can hardly be doubted that Aristophanes would employ the actual words of Aeschylus;
and the MSS.
are unanimous.

It is so rare to find a tribrach in this place that I am much inclined with Bothe to adopt Bentley's suggestion τίς τόδ’ἔλα- βεν;

All the other MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck have πίνειν, which has the penultimate long.
In the following line again του̑τον (since found in U. F4.) is Bentley's correction for the τοιου̑τον of all the other MSS.- and the editions before Bergler.
του̑τον is read by Bergler and all subsequent editors.
1055.

τοῑς δ’ ἡβω̑σι V. P. M. and the MSS.
generally, and (originally) U. and all the editions before Kuster.
This, of course, did not satisfy the metre, and Bentley proposed either τοι̑σιν δ’ ἡβω̑σι, which is found in R. and is followed in the text, or τοι̑ς ἡβω̑σιν δὲ, which is found in no MS.
but is followed by Dindorf,Fritzsche, Bergk, Holden,Kock, Velsen, Green, Merry, Van Leeuwen.
But in every MS.
δὲ comes between the article and ἡβω̑σι, just as in the preceding line μέν conies between the article and πάιδαρίοισιν.
τοῖσι δ’ ἡβῶσι O. V1. W2. οῖς δ’ ἡβῶσιν ye Kuster, Bergler, Brunck, Invernizzi, and Bothe.
Besides the two suggestions mentioned above, Bent- ley made a third, viz.
τοῖς ἡβῶσιν δὲ ποιητὰς ... δεῖ χρηστὰ λέγειν, in one sentence.
But this destroys the anti- thesis, and would in every respect be a change for the worse.
1057.
Παρνασσῶν R. V. M. and other MSS.
Fritzsche.
Παρνασῶν P. U. and other MSS. and vulgo.
"forte Παρνήθων” Bentley.
The same suggestion is made by Bp. Wordsworth (Athens and Attica, chap. viii) on the ground that Lycabettus and Parnes are mentioned together in a fragment of the lost edition of the Clouds.
There the Clouds " were repre- sented," says that excellent scholar, "as irritated by the discourteous recep- tion which they met with on the Athenian stage, and threatening to quit the theatre, and to fly off to the heights of Mount Fames from which they had come.
We are informed of the route which they intend to take, in their way from Athens thither.
They are sailing off, we are told, ὲς τὴν Πάρνηθ’ ὀργισθεῖσαι, Φροῦδαι κατὰ τὸν Λυκαβηττόν.
To the summit of Parnes, swelling with rage, and have vanished along Lycabettus.
They are vanishing towards Mount Parnes, and they are taking Lycabettus in their way.
Lyca- bettus is their first object on their way thither."
These remarks show con- vincingly that Aristophanes couples their names together in the fragment, for a reason which does not exist here.
Yet the suggestion is followed, in the face of every MS., by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.
At the close of the line P. and U. place a note of interrogation, which Blaydes and Van Leeuwen retain, Blaydes further changing into οὐ the ὂν which immediately follows, whilst Van Leeuwen deletes the note of interroga- tion after ἀνθρωπείως.1059.

Cobet (N. L. p. 182) prefers to write it περιιλάμενος, and is followed by Meineke,.
Holden, Rock, Velsen, and Blaydes.
But if the MS.
ἐν is retained, Aristophanes is speaking of the citizen's actual appearance before the tribunal, and not of his previous preparation for it.
And,therefore, here too the MSS.
are right in using the participle present.1068.

ἀντιλέγειν ... ἐλαί- νειν ... πλεῖν O. C. P3. P4. V1. V2. W1 Dindorf, Green.
All other recent editors combine the two lines into one;
Fritzsche writing ἀντιλέγειν κοὐκέτ’ ἐλαύνων πλεῖν;
Bergk ἀντιλέγει κοὐκέτ’ ἐλαὐνων πλεῖ, in which he is followed by Meineke, Holden, Paley, Merry, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen;
whilst Kock and Velsen have ἀντιλέγειν κοὐκέτ’ ἐλαύνειν, πλεῖν, the latter in the preceding line accepting Cobet's altera- tion of κἀκβάς τινα into κἀκβάντες.
But the- change of metre seems intended, and indeed required, to symbolize the change from the bold dashing sailors of old times to the listless irresolute sailors of to-day.1089.

It is, however, adopted by Fritzsche and Meineke and several more recent editors.1147.

ἥκω.
Not a single MS.
retains this, undoubtedly, the true reading, which is only preserved in Aulus Gellius, xiii. 24. Bentley saw that it should be read here, and it is so read by Brunck and all succeeding editors.
All the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck read ἥκειν;
and though R. V. P. M. U. and other MSS.
and all editions read κατέρχαμαι, yet a great number of MSS.
read κατέρχεσθαι.1161. ταὔτ’ ἔστ’
This line (with the exception of the first word ἄνθρωπε which has remained unchanged through- out) has had a strange history.
Aldus wrote it ταύτη ’στ’ ἀλλ’ ἑτέ
ρως ἔχον, which is unmetrical, is supported by no au- thority,.
and appears to be a reminiscence of Plutus 371, TO δ’ ἐστὶν αὐ ταιαυ̑ταν, ἀλλ’ ἑτέρως ἔχαν.
Junta, Gormont, Neo- bari, and Grynaeus write it exactly as it stands in the text.
Unfortunately Fracini recalled the reading of Aldus ;
and both Zanetti and Farreus have ταυ̑τ’W ἀλλ’ ἑτέρως ἔχον.
After Grynaeus the true reading became inexplicably lost.
Gelenius followed Aldus, and Rapheleng followed Zanetti.
And presently it became merely a question of amending the readings of Aldus and Zanetti.
In Scaliger and Faber it is altered into ταύτη γ’ ἐστὶν ἀλλ’ ἑτέρως ἔχον.
Bentley proposed ταὐτόν ἐστιν, ἀλλ’ ἑτέρως ἔχον.
Both Kuster and Bergler retain the reading of Aldus, though the former in his notes supplied the true reading from U. which Brunck inserted in the text, fully believing that it had never appeared in the text before.
All subsequent editors have followed this reading, excepting Blaydes who reads ταύτη ’στ’ though of course retain- ing the rest of the line as in the MSS., which all read ἀλλ’ ἄριστ’ ἐτω̑ν ἔχον.
As to ταὔτ’ ἐστ’ the words are found so accented in U. P. P. p5 F4. B. in. ;
accented as ταυ̑τ’ in R. V. M. and others ;
ταύη ’στ’
H. and one or two others;
ταυτόν ἐστ’ W2.1163.
ἐλθει̑ν MSS. vulgo.
One would certainly have expected ἥκειν, and at Hirschig's suggestion ἥκειν is read by Meineke, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen;
but Aeschylus is perhaps emphasizing the difference which the prefix κατὰ makes to the verb ἔρχομαι.1172.
τω̩̑δε R. Y. U. F4. Bekker, Diu- dorf, Fritzsche, recentiores.
τάδε P. B. O. C. m. In M. τἀδε is written over raSe. τάδε γε H. C1. and all the other editions.1173. αὖ 8tς.
This is Bake's felicitous conjecture for the αὖθις of the MSS.
and editions, and it is accepted by Meineke, Holden, Kock, Velsen, 'Green, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
Brunck had already proposed to obtain the same meaning by changing του̑θ’ ἕτεραν into ταὔ’
ἕτεραν.1180. οὐγάρμαὐστὶνἀλλ’.
Blaydesalters this into αὐ γὰρ ἀλλά μοὔστ’, which is certainly the more natural order of the words.
R. has ἀκαυστέον, but ἀκαυστέα is otherwise so universally read that I have not altered it.1182.
εὐδαίμων R. U. and other MSS.
Brunck, recentiores.
εὐτυχἠς V. P. M. and other MSS.
and the editions before Brunck.
And I am not sure that this is not the true reading, for though it is a good rule when in doubt follow R., yet in 1186 R. and every other MS.
has εὐτυχὴς, and, with εὐδαίμων here, it seems necessary to substitute εὐδαίμων there, as all do except Bekker and Inverniz?i.
The fact that in 1195 all the MSS.
read εὐδαίμων is immaterial, since that does not profess to be an exact repetition of the present line.
However both here and in 1186 I have followed recent editors.
1184.
πρὶν Φυ̑ναι μὲν R. V. P. M. U. and. the MSS.
generally, and Brunck, recentiores, except Blaydes, who reads πρὶν πεΦυκέν’.
πρὶν μὲν ἢ Φυ̑ναι H. F3. editions before Brunck.1203.
θυλάκιον.
A tribrach is so seldom found at the end of an iambic line (see on 979 supra) that Person (at Med. 139) considers this passage to be " insigniter corruptum," while Reisig would substi- tute κυάθιον, and Bothe and Fritzsche read θύλακον.
But “nice customs curtsey to great” necessity ;
and subsequent editors have seen that a first Paeon, — ◡◡\-/, is necessary here;
since Aeschy- lus means that θυλάκιον ἀπώλεσεν or κωδάριον ἀπώλεσεν would suit his purpose as well as ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν.1209. (EY.) R. P. M. U. and most of the MSS.
give this line to Euripides and the next to Dionysus, and so Brunck, and most of the subsequent editors.
V., however, and one or two other MSS.
give both to Dionysus, and so the older editions, and a few since Brunck.1220.
δακει̑.
This was suggested by Kuster, Seager, and Dobree, and is adopted by Dindorf, Bothe, Meineke, and subsequent editors.
δοκει̑ς MSS. vulgo.
Kuster refers to Sophocles, Electra 335.1230.
ἔχω Dobree, who remarks that ἕξω arose from ἕξει in the following line.
And so Bothe, Velsen, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen. ἕξω MSS. vulgo.1235.
ἀπόδος R. V. M. U. and all the MSS.
except P. and a corrector of 0., and all the editions except as herein- after mentioned.
But Dawes, comment- ing on the Latin version of Frischlinus Age, mi vir Aeschyle, vende hanc omni modo;
namque uno obolo emes aliam tibi, pulchram et probam, observes truly that ἀπόδου not ἀπόδος conveys the idea of selling, and accordingly proposes to read ἀπόδου here.
ἀπόδου is found in P. and also in O. as corrected, and is read by Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Paley, and Green.
The true reading is, however, re- tained, and the true explanation given by Bothe, Fritzsche, Bergk, Rock, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
Merry too retains ἀπόδος, but considers the appeal to be addressed to Aeschylus, and translates ἀπόδ
ος give it up.
But I entirely agree with Blaydes'sremark' 'verum hauddubie est ἀπόδος, id est solve pretium ejus, ut totius loci sententia ostendit.”
Fritzsche had long before said " Jure Bothius resti- tuit ἀπόδος, i.e. da pecuniam pro lecythio."
And Bothe's own translation was solve, numem pretium Aeschylo pro ampulla.1243.

Bentley suggested ἐγὼὐκ (ἐγὼ OVK) ἔχω, which would certainly improve the sense.
And if this were adopted, we might also accept Blaydes's φροντίζων for φρον- τίζειν.1256.
τω̑ν ἕτι νυνί Bentley, Gaisford (on Hephaestion, chap. x), Dindorf, Bergk, Kock, Paley, Green.
All the MSS.
and all the editions before Din- dorf (and Bothe since) have τω̑ν ἔτι νυ̑ν ὄντων or τω̑ν νυ̑ν ἔτι ὄντων contrary to the metre.
τω̑ν ἔτι γ’ ὄντων Fritzsche.

The stage-direction which follows is found in the MSS.

Dindorf and others resolutely omit all these παρεπιγραφαὶ, which are often, as here, essential to the right understanding of the play.

and the editions before Bergk, has ἰήκοπον in one word.1270.

1272.
Αἰσχύλε H. m. V2. F2. F3. and all editions, except Invernizzi and Bekker, who with the other MSS.
read ὦ ’σχύλε.
No doubt they are right, but nobody likes to disfigure his text by so unsightly a form.1276.
ὅδιον.
This reading was re- stored from the Agamemnon by Brunck in his notes, and was first inserted in the text by Invernizzi, who is followed by Dindorf and all subsequent editors.
It is found also in F3. C1. and, as a correction, in F5 But V. P. M. U. and the MSS.
generally, and all the editions before Brunck, have ὅσιον.
R. has ὅς δῑον.
Brunck in his text has ὁσίων (and so Bekker), but in his notes pointed out the true reading.
1281.
πρίν γ’ ἂν Elmsley (at Ach. 176, referring also to Ach. 296, Knights 961, Wasps 920, Birds 585, Frogs 78 and 845, Eccl. 770 and 857).
Compare also Clouds 267.
His suggestion is accepted by Dindorf, Bergk, and all subsequent editors, except Kock and Velsen.
πρίν γ’ (without ἂν) MSS.

τὸ φλαττοθραττοφλαττόθρατ.
So the line is written in the best MSS.
(though some write the final syllable -θρατ’, and others -θραττ’) and all the older editions.
Recent editors have varied it according to their fancy, some writing it τὸ φλαττόθρατ τὸ φλαττόθρατ in accordance with the abbreviated description in 1296, others joining the initiatory τὸ to the rest of the word, and others otherwise.1294.

του̑τον vulgo.
Person suggests, and Van Leeuwen reads, του̑τον τὸν TrOS' ὁρα̩̑ς ;
And other suggestions have been made to bring the line into the metre.
1362. ὀξυτάτας R. V. M. P. U. and the MSS.
generally, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Rock, Velsen.
I follow the MSS.
with reluctance, since the common reading ὀξυτάταιν, which is only found in m. V1 W1. F2. and C., seems better, and is indeed adopted in the translation.
ὀξύτατι Fritzsche.1374. μὰ τὸν vulgo.
P. alone adds Δι’. 1376.
ἐπιθόμην (originally the sug- gestion of Bentley) is found in P2. W2. F2. Fs. F4. C1. L. and E. and is adopted by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
But R. V. P. M. U. and all the best MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck have ἐπειθόμην, which is of course contrary to the metre.
1378.
ΑΙΣ. καὶ Εϒ.
Almost all the MSS.
attribute to both poets the words attributed in the text to the two:
some naming them, and others prefixing οἱ ἀμΦότεροι or οἱ δύο.
P. gives them to EY.
All the editions before Brunck give ἰδαύ in this line and ἐχόμεθα in 1381 to Aeschylus, and ἢν ἰδού in 1390 to Euripides.
Brunck gave them all three to Euripides, and so Invernizzi, Fritzsche, and Paley.
Bekker first in- troduced both names ;
and he is followed by Dindorf, Bergk, and (except as aforesaid) all recent editors.1384.
μεθει̑τε MSS. vulgo.
Person (at Orestes 141) proposed μέθεσθε, thinking that here the middle was preferable to the active verb, and μέθεσθε is, accord- ingly, inserted by Meineke, Holden, Kock, Paley, Green, Blaydes, and N'an Leeuwen.
So below 1393.1394.

τοιου̑τον V. U. and other MSS.
Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Paley, Green, and Blaydes.
Before Dindorf the entire line was given to Euripides.
Bentley was the first to perceive that Φράσω belonged to another speaker, and he gave the word and the succeeding line to Aeschylus, making the speech of Dionysus commence (and so it is found in R.) with λέγοιτ ἂν.
But possibly the allusion to the βέβληκ'
Ἀχιλλεὺς line is beneath the dignity of Aeschylus :
and the arrangement in the text was suggested by Seidler, and is adopted by Dindorf and all subsequent editors.
1405.
εἰσήνεγκε R. (which, however, adds a final ν) P4. Brunck, recentiores, except Bergk, Blaydes, and Van Leeu- wen, who, with the other MSS.
and the older editions, read εἰσέθηκε.1411.
ἅνδρες.
The MSS.
omit the aspirate, save that a corrector of M. writes οἱ over ἄνδρες.
It was first sug- gested by Seager, introduced into the text by Dindorf, and is now universally accepted.

This line is omitted in V. P. P2. P3. Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Meineke, and Van Leenwen:
enclosed in brackets by Bergk, Kock, Paley, and Blaydes:
and given to Dionysus by Fritzsche, Holden, and Velsen.
On the other hand, the pre- ceding line is, with much more reason, enclosed in brackets by Dindorf and Green.
See the Commentary.
The other MSS.
and editions give all three lines to Aeschylus.
In the next line ἐκτραΦη̩̑τις is the reading of all the MSS., and of all the editions except Dindorf and Green.
Hermann pro- nounced “ Male legitur ἐκτραΦη̜̑,” Opus- cula, ii. 332, and Dindorf introduced ἐκτρέΦη̩, which is read in a quotation of this passage by Plutarch, Alcibiades, chap.
16.1436.
σωτηρίαν MSS. vulgo.
Wecklein suggested σωτηρίας, taking it as ἥντινα γνώμην ἔχετον περὶ σωτηρίας τη̑ς πόλεως, in conformity with Eccl. 396. And so Rock, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.
But Aristophanes would hardly have written περὶ τη̑ς πόλεως, had he not intended the words to be taken together.1437-1441.
εἴ τις ... τω̑ν ἐναντίων.
These lines were marked as an inter- polation, the Scholiast tells us, by Aristarchus and Apollonius, and they are now almost universally omitted or enclosed in brackets.
It is plain that the answer of Euripides commences with 1442.
And lines 1452,1453, must of course share the fate of these.1454.
τί δαί;
σὺ τί λέγεις;
R. and (placing the first note of interrogation after av) Fritzsche, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Kock, Velsen.
I have placed it after δαί. τί δαὶ λέγεις σύ;

ξενίσωμεν.
All the MSS.
read ξενίσω, and down to the time of Brunck all the editions had read, later in the verse, πρίν y' ἀπελθει̑ν.
P2. has πρὶν ἀπελθει̑ν, but all the other MSS.
have πρὶν ἀποπλει̑ν.
Brunck therefore changed πρίν γ'ἀπελθει̑ν into πρὶν ἀποπλει̑ν, and to save the metre inserted τοι between εὖ and λέγεις, referring to Peace 934, Plutus 198.
And in this he is followed by all succeeding editors, except Bergk, Meineke, Kock, Velsen, and Blaydes.
Bergk omitted Brunck's του, and inserted 'γὼ between ξενίσω and σΦὼ, as if Aristophanes could have endured such a combination of syllables as -σω 'γὼ σΦὼ, and as if Pluto was likely to emphasize so strongly that he alone, without his Queen and Court, was to entertain the guests.
Nevertheless, this sorry emendation is adopted by Meineke and Blaydes.
Meineke, however, sug- gested ξενίζω, which is introduced into the text by Kock and Velsen.
It seems to me that the true reading is either πρίν γ' ἀπελθει̑ν or else νίσωμεν, as in Lysistrata 1184.
And on the whole, considering that every MS.
but one reads ἀποπλει̑ν, I think it safer to read ξενίσωμεν.
It may have been the very fact that Persephone is joined in the invitation that made Dionysus accept it so cheerfully.1486.
οἴκαδ' αὖ.
The MSS.
and editions before Dindorf have οἴκαδ' αὖθις, but Dindorf changed αὖθις into αὖto make the line correspond with its anti- strophical line, τη̑ς τραγῳδικη̑ς τέχνης.
For a similar reason he changed φίλοις into φίλοιϭι, three lines below.
1501.
ἡμετέραν MSS. vulgo.
ὑμετέραν (a suggestion attributed to Scaliger, and a most unfortunate suggestion, whoever made it) is actually introduced into the text by Meineke, Holden, Rock, Velsen, Van Leeuwen.1505.
τουτὶ P. P3. V2. Fl. F5. Brunck, Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, Holden, Paley, Green, Merry, τουτοὶ V. U. του̑το R. τουτοιϭὶ M. Meineke.
τούτοις F2. editions before Brunck.
One would not expect a paroemiac line in this place, and many critics have endeavoured to add the syllable required for a full anapaestic dimeter.
It would be easy, as indeed Blaydes remarks, to do this by writing the final word ποριϭταîϭιν.
Bentley suggested τούτοιϭιν.
Bergk writes του- τουοὶ (subaud. βρόχους), and so Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen:
but the use of the ὁμου̑ as well as the τε ... καὶ in the next line show that the ποριϭταὶ were not to have separate instruments of self-slaughter.1510.
ἥκωϭιν, ἐγὼ R. V. M. and other MSS.
Brunck, recentiores.
ἥκωϭι (with- out ἐγὼ) most of the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck.1515.
θα̑κον. Seven lines below, all the MSS.
and editions have θα̑κον (variously accented) or.
θω̑κον.
But here, with the exception of U. W2.
F4. L., all the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck have θρόνον, contrary to the metre.
Bentley proposed, and Brunck and all subsequent editors read, θα̑κον.1517.
καὶ διαϭώζειν R. Brunck, Inver- nizzi, Bekker, Bothe, Meineke, Velsen, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.
KaL σώζειν the other MSS.
and all editions before Brunck.
Bentley (before R.'s reading was known) proposed καί μοι ϭώζειν, and so Tyrwhitt and (in the form of κἀμοὶ) Person.
And κὀμοὶ is read by Dindorf and (except as aforesaid) all subsequent editors.1529.
γαίας R. Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Fritzsche, recentiores.
γαι̑αν the other MSS.
and the editions before Invernizzi.1530.
τη̜̑ τε MSS. (except R.) and vulgo.
τη̜̑ δὲ R. Bekker, Fritzsche, recentiores.
"Praestat τη̜̑ δὲ" says Blaydes, respondent enim haec prece- dentibus πρω̑τα μέv."
But it is the δὲ after Κλεοφω̑ν which responds to the preceding μέν.
The Chorus put up two petitions;
the first for the success of Aeschylus, the second for the retire- ment of Cleophon.
