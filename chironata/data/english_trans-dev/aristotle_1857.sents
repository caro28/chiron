IN this third edition, the translation of Aristotle's Rhe­ toric has been again carefully compared with the Greek, and revised and corrected throughout.
Numerous ex­ planatory and illustrative notes have also been added;
as well as a marginal analysis, which it is presumed will be found of much service to the reader.
The famous Thomas Hobbes' Brief of the Art of Rhetorick, "containing in substance all that Aristotle hath written in his three books on that subject," and forming the best summary of this noble science, has been again reprinted from the scarce edition published at London in 1681.
A body of Analytical Questions, for self-examination, has also been appended.
With these improvements, the Editor confidently hopes that the present volume will be found to contain, not only the most faithful version of the Rhetoric of Aristotle, but the best helps for the due understanding and retaining the sense thereof.
Oxford, November, 1846.
IN the present new edition of the Oxford version of the Rhetoric, it has been thought advisable not to interfere either with the text, notes, or Questions, all being of acknowledged excellence.
But, as Hobbes, by thequaintness of his Analysis, at times lost sight of the precise character of the original definitions, an Appen­ dix has been added, containing the very words of Aristotle, connected by such remarks as were necessary to preserve clearness, and furnishing such passages as should be almost learnt by heart.
The new translation of the Poetic is an attempt to unite the closeness of Taylor with the perspicuity of Twining, upon whose versions it has principally been based.
A copious selection from the notes of the last named scholar has been added, together with a few ne­ cessary ones from recent sources by the present Editor,THEODORE ALOIS BUCKLEY, CHRIST CHURCHThat Rhetoric, like Logic, is conversant with no definite class of subjects ;
that it is useful;
and that its business is not absolutely to persuade, but to recognise topics fitted to persuade.
RHETORIC1 is the counterpart of logic2;
since both are conversant with subjects of such a nature as it is the business of all to have a certain knowledge of, and which belong to no distinct science.
Wherefore all men in some way participate of both3;
since all, to a certain extent, attempt, as well to sift, as to maintain an argument;
as well to defend themselves, as to im- peach 4.
Now, of the multitude 5, some do this at ran­ dom ;
others, by reason of practice, from habit;
but as it is possible either way, it is plain that the case will admit of our reducing these things to a system.
For we are at liberty to speculate on the causes of the success, as well of those who from practice, as of those who on the spur of the moment, [attempt either to convince or to persuade].
And every one will be antecedently prepared to acknowledge that an undertaking of this description is the business of art.
Hitherto, however, such as have compiled systems of oratory have executed a very trifling part of it ;
for the means of making credible7 alone come pro- perly within the sphere of the art, but other points are merely adscititious.
On the subject of enthymems, however, which in point of fact is the very body of proof, these men say not a word ;
while on points foreign to the subject they busy themselves most mightily.
Now the feeling of ill-will8, pity, and anger, and the like emotions of the mind, appertain not to the case, but refer to the judge;
so that if, in regard to all judicial processes, matters were regulated as they now are in some states, (and more particularly in such as are well constituted,) these spokesmen would not have a word to say.
And every one approves the regula- tion J, whether they think that the law should hold this language, or whether they avail themselves of the rule, and positively forbid to speak irrelevantly to the case ;
just as they do in the Areopagus, observing this usage properly enough.
For it is not right that an orator should bias the judge by winning him on to anger, or pity, or jealousy;
since it is equally absurd­ as though one were to make a ruler crooked which he is about to use.
It is further evident that the pleader's business is nothing more than to prove the matter of fact, either that it is, or is not the case;
that it has, or has not happened.
But as to the question whether it be important or trifling, just or unjust, whatever questions of this nature the legis­ lator has not determined ;
on these the judge must somehow or other make up his mind of himself and not take instructions on them from the parties at is- sue.
It would then be most admirably adapted to the purposes of justice, if laws properly enacted were, as far as circumstances admitted, of themselves to mark out all cases, and to abandon as few as pos­ sible to the discretion of the judge.
And this be­ cause, in the first place, it is easier to get one or a few of good sense, and of ability to legislate and ad- judge, than to get many10 :
and next to this, legisla­ tive enactments proceed from men carrying their views a long time back ;
[or, from men who have reflected on the subject for a long time ;
] while judi­ cial decisions are made off hand ;
so that it is diffi­ cult for persons deciding under these circumstances to assign what is just and expedient:
and, what is most of all to the point, is this, that the award of the legislator is not particular nor about present cir­ cumstances, but about what is future and general;
whereas the member of a popular assembly and the judge decide on points actually present and definite ;
and under their circumstances, feelings of partiality, and dislike, and personal expediency, will, in many instances, antecedently have been interwoven with the case ;
and to such a degree, that one is no longer able, adequately, to contemplate the truth, and that personal pleasure or pain throws a shade over the judgment.
In regard, then, to other particulars, as I observed, it is right to leave the judge a discretion in as few as possible11:
but questions of fact, whether it has or has not taken place, will or will not happen, does or does not exist;
all such it is necessary 12 to abandon to the discretion of the judges ;
since it is not possible that the legislator ever should foresee them.
If these things be so, it is plain that they embrace in their systems matters foreign to the subject, who give us explanations of the other points, as for in­ stance-what the proem, and the narration, and the other divisions, ought severally to embrace:
for in these treatises they busy themselves about nothing else, except how to render the judge of a certain dis­ position ;
while on the subject of those means of persuasion, recognised by art, they discover nothing ;
and yet this is the source whence an orator may be­ come a good reasoner.
And it is for this reason that, not withstanding the same system is conversant about deliberative and judicial cases, and although the business of the senate is more honourable, and embraces higher social interests, than that whose subject is merely the transactions of individuals;
yet about the former they say not one word, while all undertake to frame systems of judicial pleading.
And13 they are not without a reason for this, since in deliberative speeches it is less worth while to state matters foreign to the subject, and a deliberative speech admits less of malicious sophistry than judi­ cial pleading, but is more widely interesting;
for here the judge [i. e. the senator] decides on questions which nearly interest himself, so that no more is ne­ cessary than to prove that the question stands just as he, the adviser, asserts.
In judicial questions, how­ ever, this is not sufficient, but it is worth while to engage the hearer;
for the decision is about a case which does not affect himself:
so that the judges, looking to their own gratification, and listening with a view to amusement, surrender themselves up to the pleaders ;
and, strictly speaking, do not fulfil the character of judges14.
On which very account the law, in many places, as I before remarked, forbids the saying any thing irrelevant;
but there [in deli­ berative assemblies] the judges are, of themselves, careful enough of this.
But as it is plain that an artificial system is con- versant about the means of making credible, and as this is a sort of proof, (because we are then most per­ suaded when we conceive that the point has been proved,) but the proof of rhetoric is enthymem, (and this, to speak generally, has the most sovereign effect of all the means of persuasion ;
) and the enthymem is a sort of syllogism ;
since too it is the province of logic to consider equally every sort of syllogism, whether of that art as a whole, or of some particular branch of it;
then, these points being admitted, it is evident that the man best able to consider the ques­ tion, out of what sources and how the syllogism arises, will moreover be in the highest degree capable of employing enthymems ;
provided he make himself acquainted, besides his logic, with the kind of sub­ jects about which enthymems are conversant, and what differences they exhibit as compared with the syllogism of logic.
Because it belongs to the same faculty of the mind to recognise both truth and the semblance of truth ;
and more than this, mankind have a15 tolerable natural tendency toward that which is true ;
and, in general, hit the truth;
wherefore an aptness in conjecturing probabilities belongs to him who has a similar aptness in regard to truth.
It is plain, then, that other rhetoricians embrace in their systems, points foreign to the subject, and what rea­ sons they have for inclining to the subject of judi­ cial pleading in preference to the other branches of rhetoric.
But rhetoric is useful, because truth and justice are in their nature stronger than their opposites ;
so that if decisions be made, not in conformity to the rule of propriety, it must have been that they have been -got the better of, through fault of the advocates themselves :
and this is deserving reprehension.
Fur- thermore, in the case of some people, not even if we had the most accurate scientific knowledge, would it be easy to persuade them were we to address them through the medium of that knowledge;
for a scien­ tific discourse, it is the privilege of education [to ap­ preciate], and it is impossible that this [should ex­ tend to the multitude16] ;
but we must construct our means of persuasion, and our addresses, through the medium of ordinary language;
as in fact I stated in my Topics, " on the manner of communicating with the multitude."
Again, too, we ought to be able to persuade on opposite sides of a question;
as also we ought in the case of arguing by syllogism:
not that we should practise both, for it is not right to persuade to what is bad;
but in order that the bearing of the case may not escape us, and that when another makes an unfair use of these reasonings, we may be able to solve them.
17
Now, of all the other arts, there is not one which embraces contraries in its conclu­ sions ;
but logic and rhetoric alone do this;
for they are both in an equal degree IS conversant about con­ traries ;
not, however, that these contrary subjects present equal facilities:
but the true and better side of the question is always naturally of a more easy inference, and has, generally speaking, a greater tend- ency to persuade.
To illustrate further the utility of rhetoric, it were absurd, if, while it is disgraceful for a mail not to be able to assist himself by his per­ son, it were not disgraceful to be unable to do this by his speech, which is more a peculiarity of man than the exercise of the body .
If, however, [any one should object20] that a person, unfairly availing him­ self of such powers of speaking, may be, in a very high degree, injurious ;
this is an objection which will lie in some degree against every good indis­ criminately, except virtue;
and with especial force against those which are most advantageous, as strength, health, wealth, and generalship.
Because, employing these fairly, a person may be beneficial in points of the highest importance;
and, by employing them unfairly, may be equally injurious.
That rhetoric, then, is conversant not with any one distinct class of subjects, but like logic pis of universal applicability], and that it is useful, is evident as also that its business is not absolute persuasion 21, but to consider on every subject what means of persuasion are Inherent in it;
just as is also the case in every other art:
for neither is it the duty of medicine to render its patient healthy, but to bring him on as far as the case admits ;
for it is nevertheless very possi­ ble to treat properly even such as may be incapable of again partaking of health :
and besides this [it is evident] that it belongs to the self-same art to ob­ serve both the real and seeming means of persuasion;
just as it is incumbent on logic to consider syllogisms and apparent syllogisms.
And this is the case, be­ cause the character of sophist does not consist in the faculty22 [for the logician possesses this as well as he], but in his fixed design [of abusing it23].
Here [in rhetoric, however, the one who is considered in re­ ference simply to his knowledge of the art, as well as he who is considered in reference to his moral prin­ ciples, is indiscriminately designated an orator.
But in logic, a sophist is called so in reference to his moral principles;
a logician, however, without reference to his principles, simply as regards the faculty he is master of.
However, commencing from this point, let us at- tempt to treat of the system both from what sources and in what manner we shall be able to attain the proposed objects;
having then once more, as at the outset, defined what this art is, let us treat of what remains.
LET us define rhetoric to be, " A faculty of consider- ing all the possible means of persuasion on every sub­ ject ;
" for this is the business of no one of the other arts, each of which is fit enough to inform or persuade respecting its own subject;
medicine, for instance, on what conduces to health or sickness ;
and geome­ try, on the subject of relations incidental to magni­ tudes ;
and arithmetic, on the subject of numbers ;
and in the same way the remaining arts and sciences.
But rhetoric, as I may say, seems able to consider the means of persuasion on any given subject whatso­ ever.
And hence I declare it to have for its province, as an art, no particular limited class of subjects.
Now of the means of effecting persuasion, some originate in the art, others independently of it.
By inartificial I mean whatever are not furnished forth by our own means, but which are in existence already, as wit­ nesses, torture, deeds, and all of this kind ;
by artifi­ cial, such as may be got up by means of the system, and by our own talents.
So that as regards these, we have to employ the one class, to discover the other.
Of means of persuading by speaking there are three species1:
some consist in the character of the speaker ;
others in the disposing the hearer a certain way;
others in the thing itself which is said, by rea­ son of its proving, or appearing to prove the point.
[Persuasion is effected] by means of the moral charac­ ter, when the speech shall have been spoken in such a way as to render the speaker worthy confidence :
for we place confidence in the good to a wider extent, and with less hesitation, on all subjects generally ;
but on points where no real accuracy exists, but there is room for doubt, we even entirely confide in them.
This feeling, however, should arise by means of the speech, and not by reason of its having been precon­ ceived that the speaker is a certain kind of man.
For it is not true, as some treatise-mongers lay down in their systems, of the probity of the speaker, that it contributes nothing to persuasion ;
but moral charac­ ter nearly, I may say, carries with it the most sove- reign efficacy in making credible2.
[Persuasion is effected] through the medium of the hearers, when they shall have been brought to a state of excitement under the influence of the speech;
for we do not, when influenced by pain or joy, or partiality or dis­ like, award our decisions in the same way;
about which means of persuasion alone, I declare that the system-mongers of the present day busy themselves.
On the subject of these, however, some light will be afforded, when I speak on the subject of the passions.
Men give credit from the force of what is said, when out of the means of persuasion which attach to each subject, we evince the truth, or that which ap­ pears so.
Now as persuasion is effected by these means, it is plain that it will be the privilege of him who is able to draw inferences syllogistically, and to take a full view of the subject of morals, and of the virtues, and thirdly of the passions, both what each of the passions is, of what nature it is, and from what causes it is engendered, and how :
so that the fact is, that rhetoric is, as it were, a kind ofoff-shoot of logic, and of that department of moral philosophy which it is fair to call the science of social life 3.
Whence rhe­ toric is invested with the costume.
of that science, as well as its professors, partly from inexperience, partly arrogance, and in part from other human causes ;
because, as I stated at the outset, it is a sort of subordinate division of logic, and portraiture of it;
neither of them being a science of any one definite subject, as to what may be its nature;
but both being certain faculties for furnishing ourselves with argu­ ments.
Now on the subject of the powers of the two, and their mutual relation, nearly enough has been said.
With regard to means of persuading by proving, or appearing to prove your point, just as in logic one is induction, another syllogism, another apparent syl­ logism, so also is the case here in rhetoric;
for its example is an induction, its enthymem a syllogism;
and enthymem I call rhetorical syllogism ;
example, rhetorical induction.
Now all orators effect their de­ monstrative proofs by allegation either of enthymems or examples, and, besides these, in no other way whatever.
So that if it be incumbent on you to prove with regard to any thing or person inform of syllo­ gism or induction, it cannot but be (as is evident from Analytics) that each of these will be essentially the same as each of the former (enthymem and induction).
And what the difference is between example and en­ thymem is plain from the Topics, where, on the sub­ ject of syllogism and induction, it has been stated before, that the proving that such or such is the fact in many and similar cases, is called in the other art, induction ;
in this, example.
But when, certain points having been granted, there results, by virtue of these, something else over and above these, by virtue of their existence, either as generals or parti­ culars ;
this process is, in that art, called syllogism;
in this, enthymem5.
Rhetoric, it is plain, enjoys each advantage;
for [with respect to it] the case, in this treatise, is the same as in the Methodica has been stated of logic;
the speeches of orators6 abounding, some in examples, others in enthymems ;
and orators themselves being in the same way, some fond of ex­ ample, others of enthymem.
Reasonings, however, conducted through the medium of example, are not less calculated to persuade;
but those of which en­ thymem is the characteristic are rather applauded7.
But I will hereafter explain what is the cause of this, and how we are to use each species of proof:
let us, at present, distinguish more clearly respecting these proofs themselves.
Now forasmuch as that which carries persuasion with it, does so in reference to some one ;
and either is, immediately on being enun­ ciated, actually of a nature to persuade, and enforce belief;
or [has its effect] from its appearing to prove through the medium of such [as compose the former class] ;
and as no art considers particular cases;
me­ dicine for example, what is wholesome for the indi­ viduals, Socrates or Callias, but what is so for any person of such a constitution;
for this question comes within the province of art, but particulars are infinite, and cannot be known :
so neither will rhetoric con­ sider probability in reference to particular individuals;
what, for instance, is probable to Socrates or Callias, but that which is so to persons such as they are;
just in the same way as logic, for that art does not draw conclusions indiscriminately from any subjects;
for some things there are which appear probable even to a madman;
[yet you never would dream of arguing about them ;
] but it supplies itself from subjects which require reasoning, as does rhetoric from sub­ jects which are usual matters of deliberation.
Its business then is respecting points about which we de­ liberate, and have no art specially conversant, and before auditors of such abilities as are not able to take a connected view of reasonings, conducted through many stages, nor to deduce an argument from remote principles.
Now we deliberate on subjects which appear to admit of having themselves in either of two ways:
for on questions which cannot, under any cir­ cumstances, past, present, or future, be otherwise;
on these, I say, no one deliberates, at least not while he apprehends them to be such8;
for by such a deli- beration nothing is gained.
And you may draw your conclusions and inferences, sometimes from premises which you have arrived at by former syllogisms;
and sometimes from propositions, not syllogistically de­ duced, but requiring such a process by reason of their not being probable at first sight;
but of these pro­ cesses, it is impossible that the former should not be hard to follow up, by reason of its prolixity (for your hearer9 is supposed to be a man of merely ordinary understanding), and the latter defective in persuasive efficacy, by reason of its not being deduced out of principles either acknowledged, or probable ;
so that it is necessary that both the enthymem and example should be conversant about points which, generally speaking, admit of being otherwise, (the example an­ swering to induction, and the enthymem to syllo- gism,) and be deduced out of few, and frequently out of fewer intermediate propositions than the syllogism, in its original form, consisted of.
For if any of these be known, it is not necessary to mention it;
for the hearer of himself makes this addition.
For example, in order to convey the information that Dorieus was conqueror in a contest where a chaplet is the prize;
it suffices to say, that he conquered in the Olympic games :
but as to the circumstance that, having con­ quered at Olympia, he got a chaplet, there is no ne­ cessity for adding it, because every one knows it.
But as the necessary premises out of which the syllogisms of rhetoric are formed are very few, (for the majority of questions about which decisions and consideration are exercised admit of being otherwise;
because men deliberate and consider on the subjects of human conduct, and all conduct is of this con­ tingent nature, nor is a single branch, I may say, of these subjects necessary,) and it cannot but be that you should deduce contingent conclusions from pre­ mises whose nature is such;
and necessary ones, from necessary;
(this is evident to us from the Analytics:
)
I say, since this is the case, it is plain that the premises out of which enthymems are de­ duced, will be some of them necessary, but the greatest part contingent:
for enthymems are ad­ duced from probabilities10 (εἰκότα) and signs (σημεῖα).
And thus it follows of necessity, that, of these, each respectively is identified with each of the former.
For probability is what usually happens, not abso-Another explanation, founded on three passages, the first in the Analytics;
the second by Cicero (de Inv. i. 30);
the third in Quintilian, (v. c. ix. 10,) adopted by Majoragius, is as fol­ lows :
The σημεῖον is some sensible fact, either attested by sense or reducible thereto, not a general truth;
hence it will be the minor premiss in the enthymem, not the major, the σημειόμενον, or thing signified by it, being the conclusion, and as the latter is known solely through and by the former, there is always a real or supposed connexion between them.
1st.
The thing signified may be contained in the sign which implies not only that, but something more.
The latter then, as regards the former, will stand in the ratio of a whole to its part;
as individual or particular nature to common or generic :
what is definite always containing or implying more than what is indefinite (on which principle we are told in logic that the species is more of a whole than a genus).
Hence it is defined, ὡς τῶν καθεκαστόν τι πϱὸς τὸ καθόλ
ου, and is called ἄναγκαῖον or τεκμήριον.
Hence Quintilian, observing the conclusiveness of this argument, denies it the name of argument at all:
" Non sunt argumenta, quia ubi illa sunt, quæstio non est;
" an error resembling that made by certain modern philosophers, who deny the utility of logic because the premises of a syllo­ gism virtually imply the conclusion.2nd.
The thing signified may not be contained or implied in the sign.
The latter being more vague and indefinite than the former;
bearing to the thing signified the ratio of a part to the whole, as common or generic nature to individual or particular, on τῶν καθόλου τὶ πϱὸς τὸ κατὰ μέϱος.
This enthymem ap­ pears in the same mood as the first, scilicet, Barbara, but in the second figure, hence an illicit process of the minor term.
Note, that as the σημεῖον is always the minor and the thing signified the conclusion, the relation here spoken of as καθόλ
ου, and κατὰ μέρος, must be understood not of the logical relation in the syllogism between the major premiss and the conclusion, but of the relation between two things, one specific, the other general.
Now in the εἰκὸς enthymem, on the contrary, the Jutely so, however, as some define it, but, at any rate, that which, in contingent matter, has itself so to­ wards that with respect to which it is probable, as an universal to a particular 11.
But of the signs, one has the same ratio as a particular to an universal;
the other, as an universal to a particular :
and of these, the one which is necessarily conclusive, I call τεκμήριον ;
but the other, which is not necessary, has no name assigned to it in reference to its difference [as a species].
Now by necessary propositions, I mean those out of which a syllogism is adduced ;
and hence this kind of signs is called τεκμήϱιον, for when they think it impossible to do away what has been stated, people then esteem that they adduce a τεκμή­ ριον ;
the point having been evinced and concluded;
for, according to the old language, τέκμαϱ is the same as "a boundary.
Again, there is one sign whose ratio is as that of a particular to an universal:
thus, were one to assert, for instance, that "
The wise are just;
because Socrates was wise and just ;
" this then is a sign, but it may be done away, even supposing the premiss stated to be true ;
for it vio­ lates the rules of syllogism, as to the other, when, for instance, a person alleges as a sign that a man is sick, his being in a fever ;
or says a woman has had a child, because she has milk;
this is a necessary sign ;
which very one of the signs alone amounts to a τεκμήϱιον ;
since it alone, if the premiss be true, cannot be done away.
The other sign is in the ratio of an universal to a particular;
as if, for instance, one were to say it was a sign that a man has a fever, because he breathes thickly.
But this, even granting the premiss be true, may be done away :
for it is very possible that one who has not a fever should breathe thickly.
Now what is probability, what sign, and what τεκμήϱιον, and in what they differ, has been explained :
but in the Analytics [these several gradations of proof] as well as the reasons why some are not correctly inferred, and others are, have been distinctly stated with greater clearness13.
As to ex- ample, it has been stated that it is an induction, and induction on what kind of subjects ;
and its ratio is neither that of a part to a whole, nor of a whole to a part, nor of a whole to a whole :
but example is in the ratio of a part to a part 14, of a similar case to a similar, when, both coming under the same genus, the one case happens to be better known than the other.
For instance, you assert that Dionysius, in asking a guard, has views of setting up a tyranny, because Pisistratus before him, when designing this, began to ask for a body guard, and when he got it, established himself as tyrant;
so too did Theogenes, at Megara.
And all other persons who have acted in this way, and with whom your audience are ac­ quainted, become examples against Dionysius, with respect to whom they do not yet know whether he be asking a guard with this intention :
and all these cases come under the same general premissl5, that he who is laying schemes to set up a tyranny, asks a guard.
Now then the points have been stated out of which the proofs which have an air of demonstration are adduced.
The difference of enthymems is considerable, and has remarkably escaped nearly every writer :
it is, too, a difference the very same as exists between syl­ logisms in logic:
for some enthymems there are of applicability equal to that of rhetoric itself, in the same way that in logic some syllogisms are;
others, according to the extent of other arts and faculties, existing, some already, and others not yet comprised by rules.
And hence those who employ them both escape the observation of their hearers, and if they handle them more than is right, pass out of their pro- per characters as mere orators.
This however will become clearer, if stated more in detail.
I call those forms of reasoning16 properly logical or rhetorical, in reference to which, I use the expression places ;
such are those which apply with equal advantage to ques­ tions of justice, and natural philosophy, and of the philosophy of social life, and to numerous other sub­ jects which differ in species.
The place for instance, of greater and less;
for there will not be a whit more advantage in deducing a syllogism or an enthymem from this place, on a question of justice or of natural philosophy, than on any other subject whatsoever;
and yet there are questions specifically distinct.
But I call peculiar, all those reasonings which arise out of propositions conversant with each species and genus of subjects;
for instance, there are propositions on subjects of natural philosophy 17 out of which neither enthymem nor syllogism could be constructed respect­ ing morals;
and on this subject, again, there are others out of which will arise no reasoning respecting natural philosophy;
this is also the case equally on every subject.
Now the first-mentioned reasonings (the τόποι) will render a man informed on no class of subjects, for they are about no distinct subject-matter:
as to the other (ἴδια), the orator, in proportion as he makes the better 18 selection of propositions peculiar, will imperceptibly produce a science different from mere rhetoric or logic19;
for, if he light on first prin­ ciples, thenceforth, it will no longer be rhetoric or logic which he is employing, but that science whose principles he embraces.
The greatest number of enthymems are constructed out ot these peculiar propositions, which are particu­ lar and limited;
and from the universal ones, the less.
Just then as I did in the Topics, so here must I make a distinction of the peculiar 20 propositions and places of enthymems, whence we are to deduce them.
Now I mean by εἶδη, those propositions which are peculiar to the several kinds of rhetoric;
by τόποι, those which are common alike to all.
Let us then treat of the special propositions before the others.
Let us, however, first ascertain the kinds of rhetoric itself;
in order that having distinguished them as to their number, we may separately ascertain the ele­ ments of persuasion and propositions peculiar to each 21.
THE species of rhetoric are three in number, for of so many descriptions are the hearers of orations;
be­ cause an oration is constituted of three things, of the speaker, and of the subject about which he speaks, and of the person to whom;
and to him it is that the end of the speech has its reference ;
I mean to the hearer.
The hearer must of necessity be either an unconcerned hearer, or a judge;
and a judge either of things past or to come;
one then acts as judge respecting what is yet to happen, as the mem­ ber of a popular assembly;
the other respecting what has already taken place, as the president of a court of justice;
the other respecting the abilities of the orator, as the unconcerned hearer1.
thus, then, there will necessarily result three kinds of orations, the deliberative, judicial, and demonstrative2.
The business of deliberation is partly exhortation, partly dissuasion ;
for invariably those who in their indivi.
dual capacities simply advise, and those who publicly harangue, effect one of these objects.
The business of judicial rhetoric is partly accusation, partly de.
fence ;
for the litigants must of course do one or th< other of these things.
Of demonstrative the bust ness is partly praise, partly blame.
Moreover the time proper to each of these respectively is, to the deliberative orator, the future;
for in exhorting or dissuading, he advises respecting things future3.
The time proper to a judicial pleader is the past;
for it is ever on the subject of actions already done, that the one party accuses, and the other defends.
To the demonstrative orator the present time is the most appropriate, for it is in reference to qualities actually possessed that all either praise or blame.
Orators, however, do very frequently avail themselves of other times;
as well by awakening a recollection of what has already happened, as by anticipating what is likely to happen.
The end of each of these branches is different, and, as belonging to three sub­ jects, is itself triple.
The object of the deliberative orator is the expe­ dient and inexpedient;
for he who recommends, ad­ vises you to adopt the better measure;
but he who dissuades, diverts you from the worse;
the other considerations either -of justice and injustice, of honour or disgrace, he adjoins by the way, in addi­ tion to these two.
The object of the judicial pleader is justice and injustice;
but he also embraces by the way those other considerations.
The object of those who praise and blame is honour and disgrace ;
and these also refer other considerations to these two.
But we may take as a sign that what I have stated is the particular object of each, the fact that there f are times when they will not feel inclined even to raise a question about the other :
the litigant, for example, will not always deny that the fact has taken place, or that it has hurt the other party ;
but he never, under any circumstances, would admit that he has been guilty of injustice toward him ;
for then would there be no need of a judicial decision.
In the same way the deliberative orator very often aban­ dons the other considerations ;
but as to the point that he is advising what is disadvantageous, or dis­ suading from what is useful, this will he never admit;
but it frequently happens that (on a question of in­ vasion) they do not trouble themselves to make out that the subjugating a neighbouring people is not in­ consistent with justice.
Just so those who praise and blame do not consider whether the person's con­ duct has been advantageous or disadvantageous ;
nay, they, in many instances, set it down on the score of praise, that, overlooking his own interests, he wrought some deed of honour :
thus they praise Achilles, be­ cause he came to aid the cause of his comrade Pa­ troclus, with full knowledge that himself was fated to die;
it being in his power, [by withholding that aid,] to live.
To him, however, a death such as this was the more honourable prize:
but to live would have been advantageous.
From what has been said, it is plain that the orator must first be in possession of propositions on the sub­ ject of each of these divisions, separately;
for the τεκμήρια, the probabilities and signs, are degrees of proof available to rhetoric generally.
It is necessary because syllogism, in general, is made up of proposi­ tions, and the enthymem is a syllogism made up of the propositions which have been mentioned.
And as it cannot be that what is impossible should ever heretofore have been done or should ever be done hereafter, but what is possible, only:
as again it cannot be that what has not happened, or that what is never about to happen, evet should, the one have been already done, the other be about to be done:
it becomes necessary for the deliberative, ju­ dicial, and demonstrative orator to have propositions on the subject of possibility and impossibility;
and on the questions, whether a fact has or has not hap- pened, will or will not take place.
And further, since all, as well in praising as in blaming, as well in exhorting as in dissuading, as well in accusing as in defending, attempt to evince not only the points I have mentioned, but likewise to prove respecting this good or bad, this honourable or dishonourable, this just or unjust, that it is, moreover, either great or small, whether speaking of the things independently, or comparing them respectively one with another:
as this is the case, it is plain that it will be necessary to have propositions respecting the degrees of great and small, of greater and less, as well general, as pe­ culiar to each division:
what good, for instance, is greater or less, what deviation from justice, or what conformity to it;
and so in the same way also re­ specting the other subjects.
The points then have been stated, respecting which it will be absolutely necessary to get at propositions.
We must, after this, make a distinction between each of these respectively ;
the questions, for instance, about which deliberation is conversant;
those, too, about which demonstra­ tive rhetoric is concerned;
and, thirdly, those about which judicial.
FIRST, then, we must ascertain what kind of good or evil it is respecting which the deliberative orator gives his advice;
for we have seen that it is not about every kind, but about such as may or may not befall us1.
Such however as either has or will have an existence of necessity ;
such, again, as it is impossible should exist or be produced;
respecting every such description [of good or evil] there never is any de- liberation:
neither, in fact, is there about every one even of contingent subjects ;
for of goods which may or may not accrue 2, some exist naturally, others are produced by chance, on the subject of which it is not worth while to deliberate;
but evidently [he is con­ fined to subjects] about which men resolve;
of which character are all such as are of a nature to be referred to ourselves, and the first principle of whose creation is in our own power;
for in deliberation we carry on our views thus far, viz.
till we shall ascertain whether the achievement of the object be possible to us or not 3.
Now, to enumerate in accurate detail, and to di­ vide into separate species, every subject about which men are wont to interest themselves;
to enter more­ over into minute distinctions conformable to the stand­ ard of truth to the very utmost that the subject ad­ mits it;
these inquiries it is not necessary, on the present occasion, to institute, by reason that they be­ long not to the art of rhetoric, but to some art whose province is, in a more peculiar manner, intellect, and truth 4;
and because many speculations more than are proper to this art have already been assigned to it.
For that remark is true, which I have before made;
that rhetoric is made up of the science of logic5, and of that branch of the science of social life which recognises the subject of morals;
and it partly resembles logic, partly the declamations of the so­ phista :
and in exact proportion as one shall attempt to get up logic or rhetoric, not as they are general faculties, but as distinct sciences, he will unwittingly do away their nature by his encroaching, in the act of so tricking them out, upon sciences of certain defi­ nile subject-matter, and not of words alone.
Let us, however, even on the present occasion, discuss such points as it is worth while to enlarge upon, and which still reserve the more full consideration for the science of social life:
for nearly all the questions on which men deliberate, and on which the delibera­ tive orator harangues, those at least of the highest concernment, are in number five6;
and these are Questions of finance, of war and peace, and again re­ specting the safeguard of the territory, and respect­ ing imports and exports, and also respecting legisla­ ture.
So that it will be fitting that the orator, who is about to give his advice on the subject of the finance of the state, be acquainted with its revenues, both what and how great they may be ;
in order that, if any branch is overlooked, it may be added to the rest;
and, if any be in default, it may be augmented.
Moreover he should be acquainted with the whole expenditure of the state, that if any expense be su­ perfluous it may be curtailed;
if any too high, it may be reduced.
For men become more wealthy, not only by adding to their capital stock, but by detract­ ing from their expenses as welL
These, however, are points which we must not only learn from our own experience as individuals ;
but, with a view to de­ liberation on these subjects, one ought to be qualified by a research into the discoveries made by other people.
Respecting questions of war and peace, the orator must needs be acquainted with the force of the state, how great it actually is already, and how great it admits of becoming;
of what description also it is already, and what additions admit of being made to it.
Moreover he should know both what wars the state has been engaged in, and how it has conducted them.
This must he needs know, not in relation to his own state only, but as regards frontier states also;
particularly in the case of those with whom there is a likelihood of being at war, in order that toward the more powerful, pacific measures may be held, and that in regard to the weaker, it may rest with his own state to make war or not.
He should also be acquainted with the description of force which belongs to each state, whether it resemble or differ7 from his own;
for it is possible, even in this respect, to secure an advantage to yourself, or to have one taken by the enemy.
In order to all which things, the orator must necessarily have considered with at­ tention the wars, not of his own state only, but those also of others, what has been their issue;
for it is natural that from similar causes similar results should accrue.
Moreover as regards the safeguard of the tern- tory, it should not escape his attention how that is preserved;
but he must be acquainted as well with the numbers, as the nature of the garrisons, and with the positions of the strong holds:
this it is impossi­ ble that one not acquainted with the country should know.
But known it must be, in order that if any garrison be weak, it may be reinforced;
if any be unnecessary, it may be done away, and the force may rather maintain positions strictly adapted to defence.
Again, on the subject of provision, the orator should know how great a consumption is sufficient to subsist the state, and of what kind that is which arises at home, and what is imported;
and those nations whose exports there is need of, and those to whose markets he wants to import his home produc­ tions, in order that commercial treaties and agree- ments may be entered into with them.
[All this should the orator be acquainted with], because it is absolutely necessary strictly to preserve your citi­ zens from any ground of quarrel in two of their relations, viz. in respect to those physically their su­ periors8, and those who may be serviceable in afore- mentioned points.
Thus much then it is absolutely necessary that the deliberative orator should be able to consider, in order to the security of the state;
neither is an at- tention to legislation the least essential;
for in its legislative enactments stands the safety of the state.
And thus it becomes requisite, both that he should know how many forms of government there are, and what system of things is expedient for each;
and what things, as well peculiar to the government, as opposite to it, have a natural tendency to destroy it9.
I talk of a government being destroyed by things peculiar to itself;
because, with the exception of the most excellent form of government, every other, by being relaxed or strained too much, de­ stroys itself.
Thus a democracy, not only when relaxed, but even when overstrained, grows weaker, and thus will at last be brought an oligarchy.
Just as hookedness or flatness of the nose, not only approach the mean in proportion as they relax from the excess, but also, when they become excessively hooked or flat, dispose the nostrils in such a way as no longer so resemble the nasal organ.
It is serviceable moreover with a view to legisla­ tion, to apprehend not only what constitution is ex­ pedient, by deriving your view from circumstances past, but to become acquainted also with the consti­ tution of other states, and to what kind of constitu- tions what sort of measures are adapted.
Thus it is plain, that accounts of travellers are of use with a view to legislation ;
for hence we are able to ascer­ tain what the laws of other nations are ;
and with a view to debates on matters of state, the researches of those who write on human conduct are useful:
all these points however form part, not of rhetoric, but of the science of social life.
So many then are the questions of highest con­ cern touching which the deliberative orator must be in possession of propositions.
We will, however, again discuss the elements out of which it is proper to exhort and dissuade, as well on these as on other questions.
NEARLY every one individually, and all men in ge- neral, have some object, at which directing every aim, they both choose and avoid ;
and this, to speak sum­ marily, is happiness1 and its constituents.
Let us then, for the sake of getting at a received standard, ascertain what happiness, generally speaking, is ;
and what are its constituents;
for on the subject of it, and what conduces to it, and of its opposites, exhorta­ tion or dissuasion is always conversant;
and this, be­ cause we needs do the things which procure it or any of its constituents, or which render it greater from having been less, and refrain from doing the things which destroy or impede it, or produce its opposites.
Let happiness then be defined to be good fortune in conjunction with virtue2,—or, independency of life, -or, the life which is most pleasant, accompanied by security,-or, abundance of property and slaves, with power to preserve and augment it;
for mankind al­ low either one or more of these things to amount nearly to happiness.
If then happiness be such as I have described, its constituents must necessarily be- Ist, noble birth 3, many and excellent friends, wealth, a good and numerous offspring, a good old age ;
and moreover personal excellencies;
as health, comeli­ ness, strength, stature, ability in the games;
character;
—2nd, honour, good fortune;
—3rd, virtue, and its constituents, prudence, courage, justice, temperance.
Thus furnished, one would be most independent, were both external and internal goods his own ;
for besides these there are no others.
But the internal goods are mental and personal;
the external, noble birth, friends, wealth, and distinction.
We deem, moreover, that power and good fortune ought to be present, for thus would life be most independent.
Wherefore, let us ascertain what each of these advantages is.- Noble birth then is, in the case of a nation or state, their being aborigines 4, or at least ancient possessors, and for their first leaders to have been illustrious, and indeed for many to have been born from among them illustrious on the score of things which men emulate.
Considered in reference to individuals, noble birth is derivable from male or female ancestry, and legiti­ macy on both sides ;
and, just as in the case of a state, to have had the first of their line well known on the score of virtue, wealth, or any other valued quality;
and for many of their kindred to have been illustri­ ous, as well men as women, as well young as old :
— we cannot be at a loss for the constituents of a good and numerous progeny.
As referred to the common­ wealth ;
a good offspring will be, youth who are nu­ merous and accomplished.
Accomplished in respect to personal excellence, as stature, comeliness, strength, ability in the games :
and as to that of the mind, temperance and courage;
these all, in their two di­ visions, are excellencies of the young.
In reference to individuals, a good and numerous offspring con­ sists in your own children being numerous, and they, as well male as female, such as I have described.
The excellence of females in regard to person, is beauty and stature ;
in regard to the mind, temper­ ance and fondness for employment, without meanness:
-and we ought, as well individually as collectively, in respect both to men and women, to see that each of these qualities exists.
Since all states among whom the regulations regarding women are bad (as is the case among the Lacedæmonians), enjoy scarcely the half of happiness.
The constituents of wealth are, plenty of money, the being master of lands and seats, with the posses­ sion moreover of personal property of live stock and slaves, such as are remarkable for number, stature, and comeliness;
and all these should be secure, and respectable, and useful.
The useful are of that de­ scription rather which are profitable;
the respectable, which conduce to enjoyment.
But by profitable I mean those out of which the rent arises;
by those conducing to enjoyment, all out of which arises no­ thing (that's worth mentioning at least) beyond their mere use.
The definition of security is the having possession there, and in such a manner, that the enjoyment of the property is one's own.
The essen­ tials of a property then exist, when the right of alienating is in one's hands:
I understand by aliena­ tion either gift or sale.
But, in a word, the being rich stands more in enjoyment than in possession;
for the active employment and the use of such means is wealth.
Goodness of character is the apprehension of man- kind, that you are a worthy person, or in possession of something of such a kind that all men aim at it, or at least the generality, or the good, or the well­ judging.
Honour is an evidence of your having a character for beneficence;
and those are honoured with justice, and in an eminent degree5, whose bene­ ficence has already been exercised:
not but that he, too, is honoured who simply has the power to benefit.
Beneficence relates either to the safety, and the causes, whatever they are, of the existence of its object, or to his wealth, or to any other goods whose acquisition is not easy, whether it be so generally, or at that place or time.
For many meet with honour in consequence of things apparently trifling;
but then it is the manner or the time [of conferring the benefit] which is the reason.
The constituent parts of honour are sacrifices,-monumental inscriptions, in metre or prose,-rewards,-consecrated pieces of ground6,— precedence,-public burial,-statues,-pensions from the state;
those received among barbarians are­ prostration,-giving placed
The presents also usual among each people are, with them, respectively marks of honour;
for a present is at once the gift of pro­ perty, and a mark of honour.
Wherefore it is that the avaricious are equally desirous of these, as the ambitious ;
because they convey to both that which they desire, since at once it is a property, the object which the avaricious desire, and includes honour, the object of the ambitious.
The excellencies of the body are health ;
and that in such a degree as for us to be exempt from sick­ ness, while we have the free exercise of the body.
For many are in a state of health, indeed, whom, like Herodicus8, no one would feel inclined to con­ gratulate on the score of health, by reason of their depriving themselves of most, if not all, the enjoy- ments proper to man.
Comeliness is different according to the several ages.
Now the comeliness of a youth, is the having a body useful in enduring toils, whether those of the course, or of personal exertion, himself being plea­ sant withal to look upon with a view to delight.
On which account those who practise the pentathlum are most comely, inasmuch as they are formed for violent exertion, and swiftness as well.
But the comeliness of one who has attained life's prime, is a person adapted to the fatigues of war, with an aspect to be looked upon with pleasure tempered by awe.
That of the old consists in the body being capable of the fatigues which it needs must undergo, and exempt withal from pain, by reason that it has none of the afflictions by which an old age is disfigured.
Strength is the capability of moving another at will:
you move another, of course, either by dragging, or shoving, or lifting, or crushing him ;
so that the man who is endowed with strength, is requisitely so for some, if not for all these purposes.
Excellence of stature, is the exceeding the generality in height, substance, and breadth, in such a ratio as not, by reason of that excess, to render one's motions more tardy.
Gym- nastic excellence of person is made up of stature, strength, and speed;
for the swift is also endued with strength :
for he who is able to throw out his legs in a particular way, and move them rapidly, and in a forward direction, is fit for running;
but he who can crush and grapple with an adversary, is fit for wrestling ;
while he who can send him for­ ward by a blow, is the man for boxing :
but if any be endued with the two latter qualifications, he is fit for a pancratiast;
while he who has all three may contend in the pentathlum.
A good old age is an old age slow in approach, un- attended by pain ;
for neither is it a good old age if one grows rapidly old ;
nor if he does so slowly, in­ deed, but painfully:
this blessing, however, is of the number both of the excellencies of the body and of fortune.
For one who is neither unmolested by sick­ ness, nor endued with strength, will not be exempt from sufferings;
and his days will be but few, and those not void of pain:
nor without good fortune will he hold out at all.
Indeed, independently both of strength and health there is means of long life ;
for many, without the excellencies of the body, are long-lived.
But accuracy of statement on these sub­ jects makes nothing to our present purpose.
In what number and excellence of friends consists is not doubtful, it having been distinctly stated, re­ specting a friend, that he is a friend who exerts himself to do for another whatever he esteems good for him, solely for the other's sake.
He to whom many are so affected, has numerous friends;
he to whom worthy men, has excellent friends.
Good fortune is the accession, and actual pos­ session, either of all, of most, or the greatest of those goods of which chance is the cause.
Now chance is the cause of some things about which there are arts conversant9;
of many things, too, unrecognised by art;
for instance, of whatever things nature is a cause;
for it is possible that they should happen con­ trarily to nature :
for art is a cause of health ;
na­ ture, of comeliness and stature.
In a word, those goods proceed from chance, about which envy is felt 10.
Chance is also a cause of those goods which baffle all calculation ;
when, for instance, one is handsome, the rest of whose brothers are ugly ;
or when every one else overlooked a treasure, and he found it;
or if a weapon hit one's neighbour and not one's self;
or if he alone, who used always to frequent a place, did not come there, while they who came then only were destroyed;
for all such things appear to be pieces of good luck.
As to moral excellence, since that topic is most intimately connected with praise 11, we must lay down distinctions respecting it when we treat of the sub­ ject of praise.
It is then plain at what objects we ought to aim in exhorting, as likely to take place, or already in existence;
and what in dissuading, for they are the contraries of these.
SINCE the expedient is the object proposed to the de- liberative orator, and as all form.
their conclusions, not about the end itself, but about the means con­ ducive to that end ;
as moreover these are all things which are expedient in reference to human conduct (now every thing expedient is a good), we shall have to ascertain certain elementary propositions, on the subjects of the good and the expedient in general.
Let good, then, be defined to be, 1.
Whatever is an object of choice independently, for its own sake ;
2.
and for the sake of which we choose something else.
3. What every thing aims at 1, or every thing which has perception, or which has intelligence;
or every thing would aim at, were it possessed of intel­ ligence.
4. Whatever intelligence would award to each.
5. Whatever the intelligence conversant with every instance awards to each, that to each indi­ vidual is his good.
6. That which being present, one is well disposed and independent.
7. Independency.
8. Whatever produces or preserves such advantages 2;
9. and that on which they are consequent.
10. What­ ever, too, has a tendency to prevent or destroy their opposites.
Now, things are consequent in two ways ;
for either they may be consequent simultaneously or subsequently.
—Knowledge, for instance, is a conse­ quent on learning subsequently;
life is so on health simultaneously.
Again, things are productive in three ways 3;
first, in the way that the being healthy is productive of health, or as food is so of health, or as exercise is, because usually it does produce health.
These things being laid down, it must be of course that acquisitions of good, and the exemptions from evil, are good;
for on the one is consequent the non-possession of evil simultaneously;
on the other, the possession of good subsequently.
And the acquisition of a greater instead of a less good;
of a less evil instead of a greater;
for this be­ comes an acquisition of the one and an exemption from the other, in the ratio of the excess of the greater above the less.
The virtues also must of course be a good, for in reference to them are their possessors well-disposed4;
they are also productive of goods, and bear on moral conduct:
respecting each, however, severally what, and of what kind it is, must be distinctly treated.
It must be also that pleasure is a good, for all living things naturally de­ sire it.
Thus, too, things pleasant and honourable must needs be good;
for the first are productive of pleasure;
while, of things honourable, some are pleasant, and the rest are by themselves objects of choice on their own account.
So that to speak of them severally, it must be that the following things are good.
-Happiness;
for it is both an object of choice by itself, and independent, and for the sake of it we choose many things.
Justice, courage, temperance, magnanimity, magnificence, and other habits of that sort;
for they are excellencies of the soul ;
-and health and comeliness, and things of that sort, for they are excellencies of the body, and productive of many things ;
health, for instance, both of pleasure and of life;
and it seems, on this account, to be the very best possession, because it is the cause of two things, which the generality of men value most, viz. of plea­ sure and life:
—Wealth ;
because it is an excellence of possession, and productive of many things.
A friend and friendship;
for a friend is an object of choice independently, and productive of many advantages.
Honour, character;
for they are pleasant, and pro- ductive of much;
and there is usually consequent on them the actual possession of the qualities, on ac­ count of which the subject is honoured.
Ability, in speaking and acting;
tor all such powers are produc­ tive of good.
Again, high genius, memory, readiness in learning, quickness of thought, and all such qualities ;
for these faculties are productive of good;
and in the same way all the arts and sciences.
And life ;
for were no other good consequent on it, of itself it is an object of choice.
And that which is just, for it is a kind of general advantage.
Such, then, are the things which are good, as it were confessedly.
But in the case of questionable goods, your reason- ings will be deduced from these formulae,—that of which the contrary is an evil, is itself a good ;
as is that of which the contrary is expedient to an enemy :
for example, if your being cowards be above all things expedient to your enemies, it is plain, that to the citizens your courage will be above all things beneficial.
And, in a word, whatever be the things which the enemy desires and in which they rejoice, the contrary of those things appear beneficial;
and hence was it well said ;
— "
Priam surely would exult," etc. 11. ά, 1. 255 3. And yet this case does not always hold, though it does generally ;
for there is no reason why the self- same things should not, at times, be expedient to two hostile parties ;
from which comes the saying that evils bring men together6, when the same thing hap- pens to be injurious to both.
That too is a good, which is not in excess7 ;
but whatever exceeds what it ought, is an evil.
And that on account of which much toil or expense has been bestowed, for already will if have appeared to be a good ;
and we already conceive of every such thing as of an end, and as an end of many efforts ;
but the end is a good;
and on this principle rests the force of that appeal, " It were in accordance forsooth with Priam's heartiest prayer;
” II β,1. 176.
and of this, " Base indeed is it to remain so long;
” 11. β, 1. 298.
and that of the proverb of " Breaking the pitcher at the very door."
Vide Erasmi Adagia II. i. 75.
That too of which many are desirous, and which appears to be disputed for ;
because that of which all are desirous, was laid down to be a good;
the gener­ ality, however, have the appearance of being all.
And that which is recommended;
because no one re­ commends that which is not good 8.
And that which your enemies and the bad recommend;
for all, as it were, already acknowledge it when even they do who are ill affected;
for solely on account of its being plainly such will these acknowledge it9:
and in ex- actly the same way they are held to.
be but paltry characters land with these even their friends find fault, and all good men] with whom their enemy finds no fault:
on which very principle the Corin­ thians conceived themselves to have been scandalized by Simonides introducing in his verses, " Troy finds no fault with the Corinthians 10.”
And that is a good which any who are practically wise, whether among men or women, have preferred ;
in­ stanced in Minerva's choice of Ulysses ;
Theseus' of Helen ;
and the Goddesses'of Paris 11;
and Homer's of Achilles.
In a word, all objects of determined choice are good.
And men determinately choose to do both the things which have been mentioned, and those which are evil to foes and good to friends ;
and those which are possible-these are varied in two ways ;
such as may be done, and such as may easily be done Easy things are such as are done either without pain, or in a short time ;
for difficulty is de­ fined in reference either to the pain, or length of time.
And men choose what is done as they wish ;
and they wish what either is in no respect an evil, or in a less degree than it is good.
This will occur in the case of unjust action, where the punishment either escapes notice or is trifling :
and such actions as are peculiar ;
as no one has done ;
or which are extra­ ordinary, for thus is their value greater :
and those things which have an adaptation to ourselves ;
of which kind are things belonging to us in respect of family, and power.
Things too which men consider are wanting to the completion of something else ;
for be they ever so trifling 13, they in no less degree de- termine on putting them in execution :
and things easily brought about;
for they are possible, inas­ much as they are easy:
but things easily brought about, are such as every one, or many, or our equals, or our inferiors, have succeeded in.
Whatever gra­ tines one's friends, or will be disliked by one's foes.
Every thing, too, which they whom we admire de­ liberately set about.
Things toward which men are well fitted by nature, and about which they have ex­ perience ;
for they suppose they shall more easily succeed in them.
Things too which no bad man does ;
for they are the rather commendable.
What people happen to be desirous of;
for not only does it appear pleasant, but it is viewed in the more favour - able light 14.
And men more particularly choose on deliberation the things in reference to which they severally are of a certain disposition;
the ambitious, for instance, if the object be victory ;
the avaricious, if it be money ;
and other characters in the same way.
On questions then of good and of expediency, we must deduce our means of persuading from hence.
BUT as the advocates of opposite measures, while they in many instances allow both to be expedient, dispute nevertheless on the question which is the more so;
we shall have next to speak of greater good, and what is in a higher degree expedient.
Let ex­ cess, then, be defined to be, as much and yet more;
the thing exceeded, however, to be that comprised within the excess.
Again, greater and more are terms relative always to some particular less thing:
2 but great or small, much or little, have reference to the size of things generally.
And that which is great exceeds;
but that which is deficient is small;
and of the terms much and little in the like manner.
Now as we call that good, which, independently, for its own sake, and not on account of any tiling else, is an object of choice ;
that, too, which every thing desires ;
and which, if invested with intelligence and practical wisdom, every thing would choose ;
as also what is preservative or productive of, or on which such things are consequent;
and as that, with a view to which we act, is the end ;
and as an end is that for whose sake every thing else is done:
but that is good to a man's self which has these affections in re­ ference to himself:
this being the case, it must be that plurality is a greater good than one or a few, provided that one or those few be enumerated'in con­ junction with it3:
for it then exceeds them, and the within comprised one or few is exceeded.
And if the greatest individual of one species exceed the great­ est individual of another, then also will the first spe­ cies itself exceed the second.
4
And, vice versa, wherever one species exceeds another, the greatest individual of the exceeding, exceeds the greatest in­ dividuals of the exceeded species:
for example, if the greatest man be greater than the greatest woman, then will also men, in general, be greater than women ;
and if men generally be greater than women, then will also the greatest man be greater than the great­ est woman;
for the excesses of species, and of the greatest individuals under them, have a common ra- tio.5
When one thing is a consequence of another, but that other thing is not a consequence of it;
(now, things are consequent, recollect, either simultaneously or subsequently, or virtually;
) then is that of which the other is a consequence the greater good;
because the enjoyment of the consequent is inherent in the enjoyment of the other.
Things are consequent si­ multaneously, as life on health ;
but it is not conse­ quent on life:
and subsequently, as knowledge on learning;
virtually, as larceny on sacrilege;
for the man who has committed sacrilege would be ready also to steal.
Things which exceed the same thing in a greater degree Ethan itself], are greater6;
for of ne- cessity they exceed even the greater.
Things produc­ tive of a greater good are greater, for this would be by virtue of their being productive of something greater.
That, too, the productive cause of which is greater, is likewise greater ;
for if that which is healthy, be preferable to, and a greater good than, that which is pleasant;
then also will health be su- perior to pleasure.
As also that which, independently of any thing, is preferable, is superior to that which is not preferable independently:
thus strength is above things conducing to health;
for the latter are not sought on their own account, while the former is, the which was assumed as a criterion of good.
And should one object be an end, the other not an end ;
for the one is for the sake of something else, the other, for its own sake;
thus is exercise inferior to a good habit of body 7.
That too is a greater good which in a less degree stands in need of any one or more things as accessions, for it is in a higher degree independent:
now that is said less to need accessions, which needs such as either are fewer or more easily obtained.
And whenever one thing does not exist, nor can pos- sibly be brought into existence independently of ano­ ther, but that other can without it;
then that which needs not the accession, is more independent, and thus shows itself to be a greater good.
Again, if one be a. principle and the other not;
and for the same rea­ son, if one be a cause, the other not;
since without a cause or principle, existence or production is impos­ sible8.
And of goods both proceeding from princi­ pIes, that is the greater good which arises from the higher principle;
as also that is the greater good which originates in the higher of two causes.
And, vice versa, that of two principles which is the principle of the greater good, is greater ;
and that of two causes which is the cause of the greater, is itself greater.
It is evident then from what has been said, that it is possible for a thing to appear the greater both ways ;
for supposing this to be a principle, and the other not, it will appear the greater9;
as also will it, sup­ posing it not to be a principle 10 while the other is;
because the end, and not the principle, was above stated to be the greater.
Just like the saying of Le­ odamus in impeaching Callistratus, " that the man who devised the deed was worse than he who exe­ cuted it;
for had he not devised it, the other could not have executed it:
" and conversely, against Cha­ brias, he argued that “ the agent was worse than the deviser;
for had there not been an agent, it would not have been realized in action, because people de­ vised plots on this very account, that others may execute them.
The more rare good is greater than the abundant 11;
thus gold is better than steel, not­ withstanding that it is less useful;
for the acquisition, by reason of its being more difficult, is greater.
And in another view, the abundant is better than the rare, for the enjoyment of it exceeds that of the other;
for the idea of often exceeds that of seldom;
whence it is said, “ Water12 is the best of things :
and, in a word, the more difficult is superior to the easier ac­ quisition, for it is more rare.
In another point of view, the easier is above the more difficult;
for it has itself as we wish.
That also is the greater good, the contrary of which is the greater evil;
as is also that of which the deprivation is the greater loss.
Virtue, too, is greater than what is not positive virtue, and vice than what is not positive vice;
for the former severally are ends, the latter are not ends.
Causes, the productions of which are more becoming or more disgraceful, are themselves of greater importance.
Also of whatever things the excellencies and defici­ encies are of greater importance, of them are also the productions of greater importance:
since results stand to each other in the same ratio, as their several causes and principles ;
and, vice versa, causes and principles, in the ratio of their several results.
Things, the.
excess of which is preferable or more becoming, as accuracy of sight is preferable to that of smelling, for sight is preferable to smelling ;
and the being greatly attached to friends is more becoming than to be greatly attached to money13, so that attachment to friends is more becoming than fondness for money.
And conversely, too, the excesses of better feelings are themselves better:
and of the more becoming, them­ selves, more becoming:
as, too, are those things of which the desires are better or more becoming;
for the greater desire is of the greater object:
and, for the same reason, the desires which fasten on the more excellent and becoming objects, are themselves more excellent and becoming.
Again, where the sciences are more grave or becoming, there the subject-matter also is more grave and becoming;
for, as is the science, so is its truth ;
for each science takes cognisance of its peculiar truths:
and analogous to this precedence of subjects is that also of the sciences, which recognise graver and more becoming subjects, above the rest;
for the same reasons.
And that which men of practi- cal wisdom, or every person, or the generality, or the majority, or the best of men have, or would have pronounced to be a greater good;
that of course must be such, either absolutely, or so far at least as they decided conformably to their prudence.
This, too, is a test available in common to the other ques­ tions about good;
for their substance, quantity, and quality, have themselves so as science and prudence may direct;
on this subject however we have treated.
For that has been defined to be good which every being, if fraught with prudence 14, would choose;
wherefore it is evident, that what prudence pronounces good in a high degree is a greater good.
Also that which belongs to the better men, either absolutely, or in respect of their being better ;
as courage is better than strength.
Also what the better man would make the object of his choice, either absolutely or in respect of its being better;
as, the suffering rather than the doing an injury, for this would he choose who is more just.
And that which conduces more to pleasure rather that what conduces less;
because every being pursues pleasure, and is desirous of en­ joying it for its own sake;
now it is in reference to this, that the good and the end have been defined:
that is said to conduce more to pleasure, which is conducive to it with less alloy of pain, and for a greater length of time.
That which is more becom­ ing rather than what is less so;
for the becoming ei­ ther is that which tends to please, or is desirable on its own account.
Whatever things people prefer being the causes of to themselves or to their friends, those are greater goods ;
but whatever they would least wish, are greater evils.
Things whose duration is long, rather than those whose duration is short;
and those which are more secure, rather than those which are less so:
for there is an advantage in their enjoyment;
of the former, in respect to time;
of the latter, from their being at will:
for the enjoyment of what is secure is more in their power whenever they wish.
And as are the terms arising from con­ jugates and similar inflections, so are the qualities they denote ;
for example, if courageously be an idea more noble and desirable than temperately, courage will also be something more noble than temperance, and the idea of a man's being courageous than of his being temperate.
What every one chooses is better than what some do not, as also is the choice of a ma­ jority better than that of a minority;
for as that was supposed a good which all desire, so that is propor- tionately greater which is more desired.
That, too, which litigants or foes, judges, or arbitrators selected by judges, prefer, is better;
for in one case the deci­ sion is equivalent to that of all mankind;
and in the other, men of authority and information actually do pronounce.
And sometimes good is greater in which all participate;
or not to participate in it is a is­ grace :
while at others, that is which none, or which few share with you;
for it is more rare.
Things more commended, because more becoming;
and in the same way things are better to which belongs the greater honour, because honour is as a kind of esti­ mate of worth.
Those things again are more hein­ ous on which are imposed the greater punishments.
Again, what is greater than things confessedly or ap- parently great, is itself superior in greatness.
And the same objects, when separated into their several constituents, have an air of superior greatness, for the excess of a plurality of objects is conspicuous.
Whence the poet says that Meleager's wife persuaded him to rise up to the war by entering into detail :
­ "
She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town, The heroes slain, the palaces o'verthrown, The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved Iliad ix.
705. Again, the condensing and accumulating of circum­ stances in the way Epicharmus used to do, is produc­ tive of effect, and that on the same principle as their separation;
viz.
because the condensing of them evinces great excess, and for the further reason, that it appears a principle and a cause of great results.
But as that is greater which is more rare and difficult, circumstances both of opportunity, and age, and place, and time, and strength, produce great effect.
For an exploit beyond one's strength, and age, and equals, if achieved, or if under such circumstances, at such a place or time, will gain importance whether it be good, or honourable, or just, or the opposite.
Whence originated the inscription of the Olympic victor, "Formerly, indeed, with a rough basket 16 on my shoulders, I used to carry fish from Argos to Tegea." [Simonides.]
And on this proceeds that encomium of Iphicrates [who was the son of a shoe­ maker] on himself, when he said, "From what begin- nings have these things been realized!
That, too, which is innate is superior to what is adscititious, from its greater difficulty;
wherefore the poet says, " Of myself am I taught 17."
And the greatest part of what is great;
as Pericles said in his funeral ora­ tion 18, " That the youth were swept from the city, just as the spring, were it to be withdrawn from the year.
lhat, too, is more precious which is available in the greater need;
as in old age, or sickness, for instance.
And of two means, that more immediately conducing to the end.
That whose qualities have direct reference to one's self, than those which are general.
What is possible, rather than what is im­ possible ;
for the one attaches to one's self, the other not.
And things which are comprised in the end 19 of life;
for things conducing to the end partake in a greater degree of the nature of ends.
Things having reference to truth rather than to opinion :
-as a de­ finition of matter of opinion we may take what one, likely to escape observation, would not choose to do:
and on this principle the receiving good would appear more desirable than the doing it;
since one would choose the first even should it be unobserved;
with respect however to the doing good, that it seems no one about to be unnoticed would choose20.
Those things, too, are better, of which men prefer the real possession to the appearance;
for they have a nearer reference to truth:
on which principle some argue that justice is a trifling good, because it is better for it to appear, than merely to exist21:
in respect to health, however, this is not the case.
That which is conducive to the greater number of uses;
as what conduces to life, to happy life, to pleasure, and to noble conduct;
wherefore health and wealth appear the highest goods, for these include every thing.
That which is accompanied by less pain, and on which pleasure is attendant;
tor the good is more than merely single, since it is realised both in the positive pleasure, and in the absence of pain.
And of two goods, that which, added to the same good, renders the sum greater.
That, too, whose presence does not escape us, rather than that which does 22;
for such approach reality;
whence the being really rich will seem a greater good than the appearance of being so.
That, too, which is held dear, is a greater good :
-whether, as in some cases, it be single;
or, as in others, accompanied by more:
on which account the punishment is not equal, in the case of putting out the eye of a person who has but one23, and of one who has two eyes ;
for there is, in the one case, a deprivation of the dearest object.
The sources then from which, in exhortation and dissuasion, we must deduce our means of persuading, have nearly been enumerated.
THE means of greatest and most paramount import­ ance with a view to being able to persuade and give advice in a becoming style, is the having made one's self master of all the forms of government;
and the having clearly distinguished their several practices, and legal principles, and interests:
for all men are persuaded by what is advantageous;
but that which is preservative of the constitution, is absolute ex­ pediency 1.
And further, the dictum of the authori­ tative power of the state, is itself authoritative.
But the authorities are distinguished according to the forms of government under which they exist;
for φιλει̃ν, τό τε ἲδιον καί τὸ ἀγαπητὸν, remarks :
—" I suspect as many forms of government as there are, so many are the authorities.
Now there are four forms of government;
demo- cracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and monarchy.
So that the authoritative and judicial functions will be merely one constituent of these, or the whole.
Democracy is a form of government2, in which men apportion out the magistracies to themselves by lot.
But an oligarchy, in which those only who, from the valua­ tion of property, are entitled.
Aristocracy, in which those bear magistracy who can conform to the con­ stitutional plan of education.
By such education I mean that established by the law:
for those who ad­ here to the principles of the law, are the men who, in an aristocracy, hold magistracies;
and it must be that these should appear the best, whence this form of government took its name.
Monarchy is that form in which, conformably to its name, one man is su­ preme ;
and, of monarchies, those which are held by conformity to some limitations are kingdoms, but the unlimited are tyrannies3.
Neither should the ends of the respective forms of government escape us ;
tor men choose whatever con­ duces to the end.
The end then of a democracy, is liberty;
of an oligarchy, it is wealth ;
of an aristocra­ cy, the institutions relating to education and the prin­ ciples of the law;
the end of a tyranny, is the protec­ tion of the tyrant's person 4.
It is evident then, if men fix their choice by reference to the end;
that we must accurately distinguish the respective practices, laws, and interests of each form.
But as means of persuasion originate not in argu­ mentative oratory alone, but in such also as bears an impress of character ;
for it is from the speaker's ap­ pearing a man of certain character that we trust him;
that is to say, if he appears an honest man, or well affected 5, or both :
as this is the case, it will be ne­ cessary for us to be masters of the character of each form of government;
for the character which is pe­ culiar to each, must needs be most available to per­ suasion in addressing each.
These points, however, will be ascertained by means of the same information ;
for the character will manifestly be conformable to the choice;
now the settled choice has reference to the end.
Thus then have the objects which we ought to aim at in exhorting and dissuading, as probable or actu­ ally in existence;
the sources, too, out of which we must draw our means of proof on the subject of the expedient, and on the subject moreover of the cha­ racter and legal principles belonging to the forms of government;
and the means by which, and the manner how, we shall have facilities on such ques­ tions :
all these points have been discussed, so far as was within the scope of the present occasion.
For accuracy of detail on these points has been observed in the Politics..
LET us next speak of virtue and vice, and of the honourable and disgraceful;
because these are the objects of the orator who praises or blames 1;
and because it will happen that, in speaking of these subjects, we shall at the same time throw.
light on the means by- which we may ourselves be conceived to be of a certain turn of character, which was stated to be the second means of effecting belief;
since we shall be able, by the application of the same points, to render ourselves or others deserving belief on the score of moral excellence.
But as there frequently are instances, as well in sober earnest as Without it, of praising not men or gods only, but even inani­ mate objects, and any animal whatever, as it may happen;
we must here, in the same way as before, ascertain propositions on these subjects also.
Let us then, so far as may serve for a specimen, discuss these subjects.
That then is honourable, which, while it is an object of choice on its own account, is commendable also;
or which, being good, is pleasant, simply be­ cause it is good.
But if the honourable be this, virtue must necessarily be honourable;
for, being good, it is commendable.
And virtue, as it should seem, is a faculty tending to provide us with goods and preserve them to us;
a faculty moreover capable of benefiting in many and important cases;
of bene­ fiting, in a word, every object in every respect2.
The constituent parts of virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, placability, prudence, wisdom ;
and it must needs be, that those virtues are the highest which are the most beneficial to others, if at least virtue be (as it was defined) a faculty capable of benefiting on this account, men honour in the greatest degree the just and brave ;
for justice and courage are useful to them, the one in war, and the other in peace3.
Next is liberality ;
for the liberal are profuse, and do not wrangle with people about money, the object which the rest of the world hanker after more than any thing.
Now justice is the virtue by which each has his own, as the law prescribes:
injustice, however, is that habit by which some take the property of others in contravention to law.
Courage, that by which men are ready to achieve honourable exploits in the midst of danger, conformably to the direction of and in subservience to law4:
cowardice, however, is its contrary.
But temperance is a virtue by which men carry themselves so, in respect to the pleasures of the body, as the law directs ;
intemper- ance, however, is its contrary.
But liberality tends to benefit in pecuniary matters ;
stinginess is its contrary.
Magnanimity is that virtue which is apt to confer important benefits ;
narrowness of soul is its opposite.
Magnificence is the virtue which produces grandeur in expenditures :
-again, narrow­ ness of soul and meanness are opposed.
Prudence however is an intellectual5 virtue, by conforming to which men have the faculty of actually determining on the subjects of the good and evil6, which has been mentioned as entering into happiness.
Enough has been said on the subject of virtue and vice in general, and of their constituent parts, to suit the present occasion :
respecting the other points, there is no difficulty in discerning what they are ;
for it is plainly necessary both that the productives of virtue should be honourable (because they have re­ ference to virtue), and also the fruits of virtue ;
of which kind are both the indications and actions of virtue;
but as the indications and all actions or suf- ferings of a good man are honourable, it will neces­ sarily follow that all exploits of courage whatever, and all indications of courage, that all conduct, in a word, which has been marked with courage is honourable;
and so of things just and conforming to justice, so far at least as actions are concerned:
(but as relates to sufferings this is not the case ;
for in this single instance of all the virtues, does it occur that what is conformable to justice is not invariably honourable, but in the case of suffering punishment, that which is justly suffered is in a higher degree disgraceful than what is unjustly8;
) and so likewise in respect to the other virtues.
Whatever actions have national distinctions as their reward are honourable, or whatever have such dis- tinctions rather than money.
Whatever things, among those which are objects of choice, one does, not for his own sake.
And whatever things which ab­ stractedly viewed are good, one has achieved for his country's sake, overlooking his own interest.
Things good in their own nature ;
things which are good, but not to one's self;
every thing of that kind being chosen on its own account.
Whatever things admit of being realized to one when dead, rather than in his life-time ;
for that which appertains to one in his life, rather carries the idea of its being for one's self.
Whatever actions are for the sake of others;
for they are not so much for one's own sake.
And as many instances of successful management as occur where others are concerned, and where one's self is not;
and this particularly respecting benefactors, for it then is just.
Benefits, too, are honourable ;
for they at­ tach not to one's self.
And the contraries of all cases in which men feel a delicacy;
for men are sens­ ible of delicacy both in mentioning, or doing, or in­ tending any thing disgraceful;
just as Sappho has expressed in verse on the occasion of Alcæus’saying, " I would say something, but delicacy restrains me."
"If thou entertainedst a desire of speaking things either good or honourable, and were not thy tongue teeming with the utterance of some evil;
shame had not suffused thine eyes, but thou wouldest have spoken what was fit.
Objects for which men are keenly anxious without being affected by fear9, are honourable;
for men are thus affected respecting goods which tend to reputation.
Those virtues and their fruits are honourable in a higher degree, which belong to subjects naturally more excellent10 ;
as, for example, those of a man are higher than those of a woman.
And those which are of a nature to be en- joyed by others, rather than by ourselves;
the prin­ ciple on which the just and justice are honourable.
Thus, the taking vengeance on a foe rather than the being reconciled;
both because to compensate is just, and what is just is honourable11;
and further, because it belongs to the courageous man never to be worsted.
Both victory and national distinction are of the number of things honourable;
for they are desirable, though unattended by lucre, and evince more than ordinary virtue;
and the memorials of one's name;
and what partakes of these respective characters more decidedly, is also more decidedly honourable.
Again, things which do not follow one in his life;
and whatever honour is attendant on;
that which presents features of vastness;
that, too, is honourable in a higher degree which belongs to:
one's self alone, for it is longer remembered.
And possessions unattended by profit, for they are more becoming a gentleman12;
and whatever is peculiarly esteemed among each people, is honourable.
Every badge of what is held commendable in each nation:
at Lacedæmon13, for instance, it is honourable to wear long hair 14, because it is the badge of a free man, since it is not easy for a man with long hair to do any servile work.
And the not exercising any vulgar craft;
for it belongs to a gentleman not to live in dependence on another 15.
And we must take for granted that qualities, akin to real ones, are actually identified with them, and this with a- view as well to praise as to blame;
for instance, taking the cautious man to be a cold-hearted, designing fellow;
or a sim­ pleton to be a good kind of man;
and the man who is dead to feeling, to be of a mild disposition:
and in a word, we must make a selection, invariably on the most favourable side, out of the qualities con­ comitant on the character of each;
making out the passionate and furious to be men void of all duplicity ;
and the self-willed to be magnificent and dignified:
and such as are in excess, to be in the virtuous mean;
the rash, for instance, to be brave;
the pro­ fuse, liberal 16 ;
for it will both seem to be the case to the nine-tenths of the world, and will afford room for deducing a piece of false reasoning out of the motives of the agent;
for if one rush into danger where there is no necessity, much more should it seem that he will, where it is honourable 17;
and if a man be lavish on all who fall in his way, surely he will also be so on his friends;
for to benefit all is an excess of virtue.
We ought to consider also before whom our panegyric is pronounced ;
for, as Socrates used to remark, " It is no difficult thing to panegyrise Athenians in the presence of Athenians."
We must also assert that what is valued by each auditory, is to be essentially valuable ;
what, for instance, either Scythians or Lacedæmonians or philosophers value :
and, in short, to refer to the class of things really honourable, whatever is held in esteem;
since by virtue of their being so esteemed, they appear to approximate closely that class.
Again, whatever is natural under such circumstances, tor instance, it one's actions be worthy of his ancestors or his own former achievements;
since the additional acquisition of glory tends to happiness, and is honourable.
Like­ wise every action contrary to what is natural to one, so it be on one side of what is better and honourable;
as when one in good fortune has been moderate, or magnanimous in adversity;
or has become better and easier to be won over in proportion as he became greater.
Of this nature was the appeal of Iphicrates, " From what beginnings to what have I attained !"
And that of the Olympic conqueror, "Formerly bearing on my shoulders a rough basket," etc.
And that of the epitaph by Simonides, " Though daughter, wife, and sister of tyrants 18," etc.
But as commendation arises out of moral conduct, and it is a peculiar characteristic of the good man to act on principle 19, we must endeavour to put the ob­ ject of our commendation in the light of one who has acted on principle.
Now his appearing to have acted so in many instances will be serviceable with a view to this ;
wherefore coincidences and fortuitous oc­ currences must be assumed as done on principle :
and should many and like circumstances be alleged, it will appear to be a sign of virtue and principle.
Now commendation is language exhibiting greatness in the case of virtue;
we should therefore give this further proof of the actions of him we commend, that they are of this character.
Encomium 20, however, is of ac­ tions ;
(and circumstances concur to the enforcing persuasion, as excellence of birth and education ;
for it is probable that a person so brought up, will be of such a character;
) and hence we pass encomia on those who have acted.
And a man's actions are signs of his habit;
since we commend even the man who has not acted, if we believe him to be of such a character.
But felicitation (μακρισμὸς), and con­ gratulation (εὐδαμονιμὸς), are synonymous the one to the other;
but are not so to the other two:
but felicitation comprehends them, just as happiness com­ prehends virtue.
Demonstrative and deliberative oratory have one point in common;
for whatever you would suggest to a man in giving advice, that, by a change of the dic­ tion, becomes an encomium 21.
When, therefore, we know what a man ought to do, and what kind of per- son he should be, it is necessary, it we would state this in the form of advice, to transpose and change the sentiment in its diction:
for instance, suppose we are aware that we are not to think highly of goods obtained by chance, but of those obtained by our own means.
Thus expressed the sentiment has the force of a suggestion ;
but thus, of commendation, " think­ ing highly, not of goods which were his by chance, but those obtained by his own means."
So that, when you wish to commend, see what you would suggest in advising;
and when to advise, see what you would commend.
But the diction will of neces- sity be reversed, when there has been submitted to change an idea which in one form is prohibitive, in another is not prohibitive.
We must avail ourselves also of amplification in many cases:
thus, if a man has done a thing alone, or first, or with few to share it, or even if it be a thing which he has done more than any other;
these all are circumstances of honour.
The topic also which is deducible from times and seasons;
these are circumstances contrary to what is natural.
Also if a man has often succeeded in the same thing;
for this is a feature of greatness, and originates not in chance, but will appear to arise through his own means.
Also if orations commendatory and exhorting to emulation have been founded and got up on his ac­ count ;
if also he be one on whom an encomium was first passed, as it was on Hippolochus ;
and the hav­ ing a statue set up in the forum first occurred to Harmodius and Aristogiton:
and in the same way we use amplification with opposite views;
and should you not abound in topics bearing on your subject himself, you should set him in comparison with others;
which Isocrates used to do from his familiar­ ity with judicial pleading.
You should compare the person of whom you speak, with men of character;
for it is a feature of amplification, and honourable, if he be better than the good.
Amplification falls in easily with demonstrative oratory;
for its essence is the being above medi­ ocrity.
On which account we should make a com­ parison with the generality of men, if we cannot with men of character;
since the being above the average seems to indicate virtue.
In a word, of all the formulae common to each branch of rhetoric, am­ plification best suits demonstrative ;
for the orator takes the actions for granted, and it thus remains only to invest them with greatness and beauty.
Ex­ ample22, however, suits deliberative ;
because we there decide, by arguing of the future from what has gone before.
Enthymem, however, suits judicial;
for by reason of its not being clear, the past most especially leaves room for assignment of reasons and demonstration.
Nearly all the sources out of which praise and blame are deduced, and on what sort of things we ought to have an eye in praising and blaming, the means too by which encomia and reproaches are pro­ duced, are these :
for being possessed of these points, their contraries are plain ;
for blame is deduced from the opposite sources.
IT will be for me next to speak of the number and nature of the sources out of which the orator must construct his reasonings, touching accusation and de­ fence.
Now we must ascertain three points ;
one, what and how many are the objects for the sake of which men act unjustly;
the second, how themselves are disposed;
and the third, towards persons of what character and of what disposition they do so act.
Let us then, after defining the acting unjustly, speak in order of the rest.
Let the acting unjustly be defined to be, the voluntary1 commission of hurt in contravention of law.
Now law is either general or peculiar.
The peculiar law 1 call that, by whose written enactments men direct their polity:
the general, whatever unwritten rules appear to be recog­ nised among all men.
Men are voluntary agents in whatever they do wittingly, and without compulsion.
Men, therefore, do not every thing on fixed princi­ ple, which they do wittingly:
but whatever they do on fixed principle, that they do wittingly;
because no one is ignorant of that which he chooses on princi­ ple.
Now, the principles by whose motion men de- liberately choose to hurt and do evil in contravention of law, are depravity and moral weakness 2;
for if any are depraved either in one or more respects, it is in reference to that point, on which they are so de­ praved, that they are guilty of injustice.
The illi­ beral man, for instance, on the subject of money;
the intemperate, touching the pleasure of the body ;
and the effeminate, respecting objects of ease ;
and the coward, respecting danger ;
(for it is by reason of fear that men abandon their comrades in danger ;
) the ambitious man, on the score of honour;
the hasty man, by reason of anger ;
the man eager to excel, on account of victory;
the vindictive, for the sake of revenge;
a silly man, owing to his being mistaken on points of right and wrong ;
a man of effrontery, from his contempt of character.
And in other cha­ racters in the same way each [goes wrong] respect - ing his own particular weakness.
But my meaning on these matters will be evident from what has been already said on the subject of the virtues, and from what hereafter will be stated on the subject of the passions.
It merely remains for me to state on what account, how effected, and toward whom, men do commit injustice.
First, then, let us distinctly enumerate the objects, which desiring, or which avoiding, we set about in­ justice3:
because it evidently should be considered by the plaintiff how many, and what sort of those things, from a desire of which men wrong their neighbours, have an existence on the side of his ad­ versary ;
and by the defendant again, what, and what number of these things do not so exist.
Now all men do all things either of themselves, or not of themselves.
The things which they do not of them­ selves, they do either by chance, or from necessity;
and the things done by necessity, they do either by compulsion, or by nature.
So that all things what­ soever which men do not of themselves, they do either by chance, or from compulsion, or by nature.
Again, the things which they do of themselves, and of which they are themselves the causes, some they do through custom, and others through natural desire ;
and this partly through this desire influenced by reason, and in part through it devoid of reason.
Now the act of wishing is desire accompanied by reason, fixing on some good as its object;
because no one wishes for any thing other than what he conceives to be a good.
The desires devoid of reason, are anger and appetite.
So that all things whatever which men do, they ne- cessarily do from seven causes ;
by chance, compul­ sion, nature, custom, will, anger, or appetite.
But to carry on distinctions in reference to age, or habits, or whatever else enacts itself in conduct, were su­ perfluous.
For, granting that it happens to young men to be passionate, it is not by motion of their youth that they act thus, but by motion of anger and appetite:
neither is it by motion either of wealth or poverty, simply, but (in the case of the poor) it is on account of their neediness that it happens that they cherish an appetite t'Or wealth ;
and (in the case of the rich) on account of their having the means, that they risk an appetite for unnecessary pleasure ;
and these persons will act neither by motion of their wealth nor of their poverty, but by motion of appe­ tite.
And in exactly the same way, the just and un­ just, and all such as are said to act conformably to habits, will in reality act, under all circumstances, by motion of these principles ;
for they on the impulse either of reason or of passion;
but some from good manners and passions, others from the contrary.
Still, however, it happens that on habits of this par- ticular character, principles of action the same in character are consequent;
and on those of that kind, principles also of that kind.
For on the temperate man perhaps forthwith, by motion of his temper­ ance, are attendant good opinions and appetites re­ specting pleasures ;
but on the intemperate, the con- trary on these same subjects, For which reason we must wave distinctions of such a kind;
but we must consider, on what conditions 4, what principles of conduct are wont to follow:
for it is not ordained, (in the nature of things,) that, if a man be white or black, or tall or short, principles of this or that kind should be attendant on him;
but if he be young or old, just or unjust, here some difference begins ;
and so, in a word, in the case of all contingent circum­ stances whatever, which produce a difference in the tempers of men, for instance, a man's seeming to himself to be rich or poor, fortunate or unfortunate ;
in all these cases there will be some essential differ­ ence.
Of this, however, we will speak hereafter;
let us now treat first of the remaining points.
Things proceed from chance which are of such kind that their cause is not definite, and are produced in the ab­ sence of any final motive, and that neither invariably, nor usually, nor in any prescribed order.
My mean­ ing on these subjects will be plain from the definition of chance.
All those things exist naturally whose cause is internal and ordinate;
for they turn out, either invariably or generally, in the same way;
since there is no need of an accurate inquiry on results contrary to nature, whether they be produced conformably to a certain nature, or any other cause.
It would appear, too, that chance is the cause of such results.
All things originate in compulsion, which are produced through the instrumentality of the agents themselves, contrary to their inclination and reason.
In habit originates every thing which men do because they have often done it before.
From will proceed what- ever of the forementioned goods appear to be useful, either as an end or as conducing to the end, when it is by reason of such their usefulness that they are real­ ized in action:
for even the intemperate do some things which are useful;
but not on account of their useful­ ness, but on account of pleasure.
Through the medium of anger and excited feeling arise acts of vengeance.
Now, between revenge and punishment there is a dif­ ference ;
for punishment is for the sake of the sufferer, but revenge for that of the person inflicting it, in or­ der that he may be satiated6.
On what subjects this excitement of feeling exists, will therefore be plain in my treatise of the passions.
But all such things as ap- pear pleasant are produced in action on the impulse of appetite.
But that which is familiar and has be­ come habitual, is of the number of things pleasant;
for many things there are, even among such as are not pleasant naturally, which, when men have been habituated to, they do with pleasure.
So that, to speak in one word comprehending the whole, every thing whatsoever which men do of their own proper motion, either is good, or apparently good;
pleasant, or apparently pleasant.
But as they act voluntarily in whatever they do of their own motion, and invo­ luntarily in whatever they do not of their own motion;
all things whatsoever in respect to which they act voluntarily, will be either good or apparently good ;
pleasant or apparently pleasant.
For I also set down the getting quit either of evils or apparent evils, and the getting a less evil in exchange for a greater, in the class of goods;
because they are in a certain way desirable things..
And, among things pleasant, I likewise set down the getting quit of things bringing pain, or appearing to do so;
or the getting things less so, in exchange for such as are so in greater de­ gree.
We have therefore to ascertain the number of things pleasant 7 and of what kinds they are.
Now on the subject of what is useful, something has been already said in my treating of deliberative rhetoric ;
but on the subject of what is pleasant let us treat, beginning at this point.
As to the definitions, you must deem them to be adequate [to my purpose] if they be found, on each subject, exempt from obscurity, though not accurately precise.
LET it be laid down by us, that pleasure is a certain motion of the soul, and a settlement of it, at once rapid and perceptible, into its own proper nature;
and that pain is the contrary.
If then pleasure be a thing of this nature, it is plain that whatever is pro­ ductive of the disposition I have described, is plea­ sant ;
while every thing of a nature to destroy it, or produce a disposition the opposite to it, is painful.
Generally speaking, therefore, it is necessary, both that the being in progress toward a state conform­ able to nature, should be pleasant;
and that, in the highest degree, when those feelings, whose original is conformable to it, shall have recovered that their nature ;
and habits, because that which is habitual becomes by that time natural, as it were;
for, in a certain way, custom is like nature, because the idea offrequency is proximate to that of always;
now na­ ture belongs to the idea of always, custom to that of often.
What is not compulsory, also, is pleasant;
for compulsion is contrary to nature.
Wherefore acts of necessity are painful;
and it has been truly remark­ ed, " Every act of necessity is in its nature painful."
It must be also that a state of sedulous attention, anxiety, the having the mind on the stretch, are painful, for they all are acts of necessity, and con­ strained, unless they have become habitual;
but it is custom which, under such circumstances, renders them pleasant.
The contraries of these must also be pleasant;
wherefore, relaxation of mind, leisure, listlessness, amusements, and intervals of rest, rank in the class of things pleasant;
for none of these has any thing to do with necessity.
Every thing of which there is an innate appetite, is pleasant;
for appetite is a desire of what is pleasant.
Now, of ap­ petites, some are irrational, others attended by reason.
I call all those irrational, which men desire, not from any conception which they form :
of this kind are all which are said to exist naturally, as those of the body;
thirst or hunger, for instance, in the case of sustenance;
and the appetite of sustenance in every kind.
And the appetites connected with objects of taste, and of lust, and, in fact, objects of touch gener­ ally ;
the appetite of fragrant odours, too, as connect­ ed with smelling, and hearing, and sight.
Appetites attended by reason, are all those whatsoever which men exercise from a persuasion :
for many things there are which they desire to behold, and possess, on hearsay and persuasion.
Now, as the being pleased stands in the perception of a certain affec­ tion, and as imagination is a kind of faint perception, there will attend on him who exercises either me­ mory or hope, a kind of imagination of that which is the object of his memory or hope ;
but if so, it is plain that they who exercise memory or hope, cer­ tainly feel pleasure, since they have also a perception.
othat every thing pleasant consists either in the perception ot present objects, or in the remembrance of those which have already been, or in the hope of such as are yet to be ;
for men exercise perception on present, memory on past, and hope on future ob- jects.
Now the objects of memory are pleasant, not only such as at the moment while present were pleasant, but some even which were not pleasant, should their consequence subsequently be honour­ able and good ;
and hence this saying, " But it is indeed pleasant for a man, when preserved, to re­ member his toils and this, " For after his suffer­ ings, a man who has suffered much, and much achieved, is gladdened at the recollection."
But the reason of this is, that to be exempt from evil is pleasant 1.
And all objects are pleasant in hope, which appear by their presence either to delight or benefit in a great degree;
or to benefit, without giving pain.
In a word, whatever objects by their presence delight us, do so, generally speaking, as we hope for, or remember them.
On which account, too, the feeling of anger is pleasant;
just as Homer has remarked of anger in his poem, " That which with sweetness far greater than distilling honey as it drops for there is no one who feels anger where the object seems impracticable to his revenge ;
nor with those far their superiors in power do men feel anger at all, or if they do, it is in a less degree.
There is also a kind of pleasure consequent on most appetites;
for either in the recollection that they have enjoyed them, or in the hope that they shall enjoy them, men are affected and delighted by a certain pleasure :
thus men possessed by fevers feel delight, amid their thirst, as well at the remembrance how they used to drink, as at the hope of drinking yet again.
Lovers, too, feel delight in conversing, writing, and composing something, ever about the object beloved ;
because, in all those energies, they have a perception, as it were, of the object they love.
And this is in all cases a criterion of the commence­ ment of love, when persons feel pleasure not only in the presence of the object, but are enamoured also of it when absent, on memory;
wherefore, even when pain arises at absence, nay in the midst of mourning, and the very dirge of death, there yet arises within us a certain pleasure.
For the pain is felt because the object is not present;
but the pleasure consists in remembering and seeing, as it were, both the person, and what he used to do, and the kind of character of which he was.
Whence has it been said, and with probability enough, "Thus spake he, and excited within them all a desire of lamentation."
Also the avenging one's self is pleasant 2;
for the getting of that is pleasant, the failing to get which is painful:
now the angry do feel pain in an excessive degree if they be not avenged ;
but in the hope of revenge they take pleasure.
Again, to overcome is pleasant, not to the ambitious only, but even to all;
for there arises an imagination of superiority, for which all, either in a faint or more violent degree, have an appetite.
But 1 since to overcome is pleasant, it must follow of course, that amusements where there is field for rivalry, as those of music and disputations, are plea­ sant ;
for it frequently occurs, in the course of these, that we overcome;
also chess, ball, dice, and draughts.
Again, it is the same with respect to amusements where a lively interest is taken3;
for, of these, some become pleasant as accustomed to them;
others are pleasant at first;
for instance, hunting and every kind of sporting ;
for where there is rivalry, there is also victory;
on which principle the disputations of the bar and of the schools are pleasant to those who have become accustomed to them, and have abilities.
Also honour and good character are most pleasant, by reason that an idea arises, that one is such as is the good man;
and this in a greater de­ gree should those people pronounce one such, who he think speaks truth:
such are those immediately about one, rather than those who are more removed;
familiar friends, and acquaintances, and one's fellow citizens, rather than those who are at a distance;
the present, rather than a future generation ;
a man of practical wisdom, rather than a mere ignoramus ;
many, than a few;
for it is more likely that these I have mentioned will adhere to the truth, than that the opposite characters will:
since one has no anxiety about the honour or the opinions of such as one greatly despises, children and animals for instance, not at least for the sake of such opinion itself;
but if one is anxious about it, then it is on account of something else.
A friend, too, ranks among things pleasant;
for the affection of love is pleasant;
since there is no lover of wine, who does not delight in wine:
also the having affection felt toward one is pleasant;
for there is in this case also an idea of one's being an excellent person, which all who have any sensibility to it are desirous of;
now the having affection felt for you is the being beloved yourself, on your own account.
Also the being held in admir­ ation is pleasant, on the very account of being hon- cured by it.
Flattery and the flatterer are pleasant;
since the flatterer is a seeming admirer and a seeming friend4.
To continue the same course of action is also pleasant;
for what is habitual was laid down to be pleasant.
To vary is also pleasant;
for change is an approach to what is natural:
for sameness pro­ duces an excess of a stated habit;
whence it has been said, " In every thing change is pleasant5."
For on this principle, whatever occurs at intervals of time is pleasant, whether persons or things;
for it is a variation of present objects;
and at the same time that which occurs merely at intervals possesses the merit of rarity.
Also learning and admiration, generally speaking, are pleasant;
for under admira­ tion exists a desire [to learn], so that what is admired is desired ;
and in the act of learning:
there is a set­ tlement into a state conformable to nature.
To benefit and to be benefited are also of the number of plea­ sant things ;
for to be benefited, is to get what peo­ ple desire ;
but to benefit, is to possess and abound ;
things, the both of which men desire.
And because a tendency to beneficence is pleasant 6, it is also plea­ sant to a man to set his neighbour on his legs again, and to put a finish to that which was deficient in some particular.
But as the acquisition of know- ledge is pleasant, and the feeling admiration, and such things;
that, too, must necessarily be pleasant which has been expressed in imitation, as in painting, sculpture, and poetry:
also, every thing is pleasant which has been correctly imitated, although the ori­ ginal object, of which it is the imitation, may not in itself be pleasant;
for one does not feel pleasure on that account;
but there is an inference that " this means that:
" and thus it happens that we learn something.
Also sudden revolutions7, and the being saved from danger narrowly;
for all these are cases exciting admiration.
Again, since that is pleasant which is conformable to nature, and things which are akin are respectively conformable to nature, every thing like and akin, speaking generally, is pleasant;
as man to man, horse to horse, and youth to youth.
Whence also these proverbs originate:
" Fellows in age, delight;
"—"Whatever is similar ;
"-" Beasts recognise their species;
"—" Birds of a feather flock together;
" and every other saying of this sort.
But as every thing like and akin is delightful to it, and as every one stands to himself in this relation in a most special manner, all must be, more or less, lovers of themselves;
for all these qualities do in a par­ ticular manner exist in reference to self.
But as all are lovers of themselves, that necessarily which is their own must be pleasant to all;
as, for instance, their sayings and productions.
On which account men are in general fond of flatterers and lovers, and are ambitious and fond of children;
for children are their own production8.
It is also pleasant to put a finish to what is deficient9;
for it became by that .
time one's own production.
And as rule is the most pleasant of all things, the appearing to be wise is also pleasant;
for knowledge is a principle of power;
and wisdom is a knowledge of many subjects, and those commanding admiration.
Moreover, as men in general are ambitious, the power of rebuking one's neighbour must needs be pleasant.
Also the pausing on that province in which he appears to be best, when compared with his own powers in other re­ spects;
just as Euripides remarks, "And this he plies, allotting the greatest part of each day to it, in which, himself being compared with himself, he appears most excellent.
"
In a similar way, since amusement ranks among pleasant things, and as every relaxation and laughter is of the number, things ridiculous must therefore of course be pleasant, as well persons as expressions and productions.
But on the subject of the ridiculous, a detailed discussion has been entered into in the Poetics 10.
Let thus much have been said on the sub­ ject of things pleasant;
from the contraries of these things, what is painful will be evident.
These, then, are the objects for the sake of which men act unjustly.
LET us now state with what dispositions men commit injustice, and towards whom they do so.
As regards themselves then, it is when they think the thing is one possible to be done, and possible to themselves;
and either that, in doing it, they shall escape detec­ tion, or, if they do not escape it, that they shall not suffer punishment, or that they shall indeed suffer a punishment, but that the damage thereby incur­ red will be less than the gain, either to themselves or those for whom they have a regard.
Now the 1 subject of things which appear possible, and those which appear impossible, will be explained in the se­ quel;
for these are points applicable in common to all kinds of rhetoric 1.
Now as to their own advan­ tages, those men think they are in the highest degree likely to commit injustice with impunity, who are of ability in speaking, and men of the world, and such as have experienced many a forensic contest.
If, too, they happen to have many friends.
If they be rich2.
And more particularly do they think they can get off, if they be themselves3 possessed of the forestated qualities ;
and if they be not themselves so qualified, yet if they have friends, or supporters, or associates4 of such talents, then also they think to get off;
for these are the endowments, by aid of which men are able both to act, to escape detection, and avoid punishment 5.
Again, if they be friends, either of the injured party, or of the judge;
because friends are off their guard against injustice, and are moreover appeased before prosecuting their revenge.
But the judges gratify their friends, and either alto­ gether let them off, or amerce them in a trifle.
People likely to escape detection, are those the very opposite in character to the charge ;
as, a man of per­ sonal imbecility, on a charge of assault;
or one poor and deformed, on a charge of adultery.
Again, cir­ cumstances exceedingly palpable, and in the eyes of all the world:
for these are unobserved, by reason that no one would think of them at all.
Acts, too, of such enormity and such a character that no one would presume;
for in regard to these also men are off their guard:
for it is against crimes which are ordinary, as it is against bodily infirmity of an usual kind, that men set themselves on their guard ;
but as to cases in which no one yet has been afflicted, no one is cautious.
Also those people are open to at- tack, to whom no one is an enemy, or to whom many are;
for in the one case the aggressors think to escape detection from their not being on their guard;
and in the other, they escape from its not seeming likely that they would make an attempt on people ever on their guard, and from their having ever at hand the plea, that they never could have been so mad as to attempt it.
Those again are likely to act unjustly, who have at hand means of concealing or changing property, places to hide, or any easy means of dispos­ ing of it.
All those persons, too, who, if they do not escape, having nevertheless means of setting aside the sentence, or of tedious delay, or of corrupting the judges ;
and who, if the fine be imposed, can yet set aside its payment, or put it off a length of time, or who, from their neediness, have nothing to lose.
All, too, who have the gain clearly in view, or great, or close at hand;
while the loss is trifling, indistinct, and at a distance.
Also any one to whom the punishment is not adequate to the advantage;
of which kind a tyranny seems to be.
All, again, in whose case the commission of injustice is an act of gain, while the punishment is mere opprobrium.
So, on the contrary, are they whose unjust acts lead to a kind of credit, (as if it should happen for one, in their commission to avenge a father or mother, as was the case of Zeno,) while the punishment leads merely to fine, banishment, or something of that kind ;
for both descriptions of persons act unjustly ;
however, they are not the same in character, but the very opposite.
Persons, too, who have often escaped notice, or who have not been punished.
People who have often met with ill success ;
for these, like persons engaged in warlike operations, are of a disposition to renew the contest.
Every one also to whom the pleasant is immediate, while the painful is subsequent;
or it the object be gain, while the loss is subsequent;
for all inconti- nent persons are thus affected:
now incontinence is conversant about all objects whatsoever which men desire6.
And on the contrary, persons are wont to act unjustly in cases where the painful or loss is immediate, but the pleasant and expedient is subse­ quent, and slow in presenting itself;
for continent persons, and such as have rather more practical wisdom, pursue objects of this kind.
Wherever, too, a person may appear to have acted by chance, by necessity, natural bent, or habit;
and, in a word, to be guilty of error, not of injustice.
Also in what­ ever cases it may happen that one would meet with equity.
Again, whatever persons are in want:
now men are in want two ways ;
for either they want necessaries, like the poor;
or something in excess, just as the rich7.
People, too, of exceedingly good character, or such as are utterly destitute of charac­ ter ;
the first, on the principle that they shall not appear the culprits ;
the last, that they shall not be a whit worse off as to character.
Thus affected in themselves, then, it is that men attack their neighbours.
But they act unjustly against persons, and on ac- count of objects, of the following descriptions.
Per­ sons who possess things which themselves are in need of, be it for necessaries, for superfluity, or for sensual enjoyment:
people who are at a distance, and those who are near;
for the means of getting at the one are quick, and the vengeance of the others is slow ;
as on those, for instance, who plunder Carthaginians8:
and men who are not cautious, nor apt to be on their guard, but are of a disposition to repose confidence ;
for it is easy enough to elude all such.
Also towards such as are of an indolent turn;
for to prosecute is the part of a man who is strenuous.
Against such also as have a delicate sense or honour;
for these are not apt to squabble about gain :
and again, those who have been wronged by many already, yet without their pro­ secuting ;
as though these were, in the words of the proverb, "a prey to very Mysians9."
Both against those who never yet have been wronged, and those who frequently have been, men are wont to act un­ justly ;
both being off their guard, the first under the idea that they never shall be wronged, the last as though they should not be wronged any more :
also against those who have had imputations thrown on their characters, or who are open to it;
for such peo­ ple, from a fear of the judges, do not take on them­ selves to effect persuasion, neither, in fact, are they able ;
of which class are all who are disliked and en­ vied.
Men act unjustly also towards those against whom they have any pretext, on the .
part either of their ancestors, themselves, or friends, that they have wrought ill, or intended it, either against themselves, or their ancestors, or those for whom they have a re­ gard ;
for, as the proverb goes, " Malice wants only an excuse.
Against friends and against enemies are acts of injustice committed ;
for against the first it is easy11, against the others pleasant:
also against those who are friendless, and those who are not of ability in speaking or acting;
because these either do not at all attempt to prosecute, or are reconciled, or bring nothing to the point:
also against those whom it will not pay to be waiting in watch for the sentence of court, or the payment of the fine;
for instance, foreigners and mechanics;
for people under these cir­ cumstances are reconciled for a trifle, and are easily hushed.
People, too, who themselves have been guilty of injustice in many instances, or in cases of the very character under which they now are wronged;
because it appears to approximate in some degree to non-commission of injustice, when a person shall have been wronged in a particular, in which he is himself wont to be guilty;
it is, I mean, as if one were in­ solently to assault the person of a man who is himself in the habit of being insolent.
Those also get in­ jured who have wrought ill, or who possessed, or do now possess, an inclination to do so, or who are about to do so ;
for the act involves what is pleasant and honourable;
and it appears to approximate to non- commission of.
injury:
those, too, in injuring whom, a man gratifies his friends, those he admires or loves, on whom he is in dependence, or, in a word, all at whose control he lives, and at whose hands it happens he will meet with equitable consideration.
Men also wrong those with whom they have ground of quarrel, and have been previously at variance, as Calippus did in the case about Dion;
for acts of this nature seem to approximate to a non-commission of injus- tice:
and those who are on the eve of being injured by others, should we not do so ourselves;
since this admits no longer any deliberation;
just as Ænesi­ demus is said to have sent presents of cups12 to Gelon after he had reduced some state, because he had gotten the start, himself being on the eve of attempting it.
Injurers attack those, also, by injuring whom they will be enabled to do many acts of justice, as though they could easily amend their error;
just as Jason the Thessalian said, "that in some particulars one must needs act with injustice, in order to his being able to do many deeds of justice 13:
" again, they attack people in those particulars, in regard to which, all or most persons usually act wrong ;
because here they think to meet with fellow feeling:
in regard also to particulars easy to conceal, of which nature are arti- cles quickly consumed, victuals tor instance;
or ar­ ticles admitting a ready change, either in shape, co­ lour, or composition ;
or which it is easy to put out of sight in a variety of places;
of which sort are articles easily portable, and hidden in small places ;
articles also the like to which, or some undistinguish- able from them, have previously been in the posses­ sion of the individuals who thus violate justice.
Men injure, moreover, in regard to such particulars, as the injured parties have a delicacy in mentioning ;
thus in assaults on females intimately connected, or on themselves, or on their children:
in all cases, too, in regard to which the prosecuting party would ap­ pear litigious;
of this nature are trifling things, and those in which people sympathize and forgive.
The dispositions then under which, the objects for whose sake, and the person towards whom, men act unjustly, and why they do so, are nearly these which I have stated.
COMMENCING from this point, let me mark in detail all acts which conform to, or which violate justice.
Now right and wrong have been defined in reference to two kinds of law, and in a twofold way also in re­ gard to those persons to whom they refer 1.
Law 2, now, I understand, to be either peculiar or universal;
peculiar, to be that which has been marked out by each people in reference to itself, and that this is partly unwritten, partly written.
I call that law uni­ versal, which is conformable merely to dictates of na­ ture ;
for there does exist naturally an universal sense of right and wrong3, which, in a certain degree, all intuitively divine, even should no Intercourse with each other, nor any compact have existed4;
which sentiment the Antigone of Sophocles enters uttering, that it was just, namely to bury Polynices, though de­ nounced, since this by nature was a deed of justice:
" For by no means is it for this or the next day mere­ ly that this maxim is in force, but for ever;
nor is there any one who knows from whom it proceeded 5.
And as Empedocles says on the subject of not slaying that which has life:
for this maxim is not right here, and wrong there, " but a principle of law to all, it is extended uninterruptedly throughout the spacious firmament and boundless light."
And as Alcidamas remarks in the Messeniac oration.
As to the persons also in reference to whom right and wrong have been defined, a twofold distinction has been made6;
for that which we ought to do and to leave undone, exists in reference either to the com­ munity, or to an individual member of it.
And hence we may, as regards acts of justice, and the contrary, violate justice or adhere to it in two ways;
for we may do so in reference either to an individual, or to the community:
for the man who is guilty of adultery, or of an assault, injuries some individual;
but he who will not bear arms injures the commu­ nity.
Now as all acts of violating justice have been dis­ tinguished, and as some of them are against the com­ munity, and others against one or more individual members of it, let me, after reverting to what the suf- fering inj ustice is, explain the rest.
Now to be injured, is to suffer injustice at the hands of a willing agent;
for commission of injustice has been previously de­ fined to be a voluntary act.
As however it is neces­ sary that the person injured should be hurt, and in­ voluntarily, hurt.
Now what hurt is will be evident from what has gone before;
for things good and evil have been distinctly spoken of above, and voluntary acts also;
namely, that they are all things done know- ingly.
So that all grounds for complaint must exist, necessarily in reference either to the community, or to individual interests;
the agent being either uncon­ scious, or unwilling, or willing, and conscious;
and [in the last] of these cases, acting either on deliberate choice, or on the impulse of passion.
Now I shall treat on the subject of anger in my discussion of the passions;
but it has been above explained under what circumstances, and with what dispositions, men act on deliberate principle.
But as people, while they acknowledge their hav­ ing acted in such a way, very frequently will not ac­ knowledge the designation in the indictment, or the view of the case on which the indictment turns :
a man will avow, for example, his having taken a thing, but not his having stolen it;
that he struck the first blow, but yet did not insult;
that he co­ habited, but did not commit adultery, with the woman in question;
or that he stole, but was not guilty of sacrilege, for it was not consecrated property;
or that he did till beyond his boundary, but encroached not upon public land ;
or conversed with the enemy, but was yet not guilty of treason:
it will, for these rea­ sons, be necessary to lay down definitions on these matters ;
as to what essentially constitutes theft, in­ sult, and adultery;
in order that, if we wish to show that they really do or do not exist, we may be able to set the right or the case in a true light.
Now all these questions, as to a matter being unjust and cri­ minal, or not unjust, do in fact constitute the ground of inquiry;
for the criminality and injustice of the act stands essentially in the deliberate principle on which it is done ;
and this sort of terms marks, over and above the matter of fact, the principle also of the agent;
the terms, assault and felony, for instance;
for because a man has struck another, he will not under all circumstances have assaulted him, but if he has done so with a view to something, as with a view to treat him with disrespect, or to his own gratification :
neither, supposing a man has taken privily, has he been guilty, in every case, of larceny;
but if he took it to the injury of another, or in order to appropriate it to himself, then indeed he has been guilty of larceny.
The case too is similar respecting other terms de­ signating crimes to what has been remarked respect­ ing these.
But as there were two species of things right and wrong ;
for one was of written prescript, the other of unwritten law ;
now those on the subject of which the laws speak a written language have been treated of ;
and of those arising from unwritten law there are two kinds.
And these are, the one class which is always in proportion to the excess of vice or virtue of the agent, on which are consequent either cen­ sures and praises, or deprivation of rank and marks of distinction and public grants ;
thus, for instance, the being grateful to a benefactor, and the repaying with kindness one who has been kind to yourself, and the having an inclination to aid one's friends, and whatever other duties are of this kind:
the other class, are the supplement' ot the peculiar and written law of states ;
for the equitable should seem to be somewhat just.
And equity is that idea of justice, which contravenes the written law.
8
And this con- tradiction happens, partly indeed against the will, and partly with the will of the legislator:
it then happens against his will, when the question may have escaped his notice ;
but, with his will, whenever he has it not in his power accurately to make distinc­ tion, but it is necessary that he pronounce univer­ sally, though the case be not so absolutely without exceptions, but generally only.
Thus also in respect to all cases about which, by reason of their infinitude, it is not easy to make distinctions;
such, with regard to wounding with steel, are the distinctions as to the size and nature of the instrument, for an age would fail one in the enumeration.
Be it then that the case admits not such distinctions, yet if one must needs enact a law respecting it, he cannot do otherwise than speak in general terms9;
so that one who has so much as a ring on his finger, and lifts up his hand and strikes you, does by the letter of the written law stand guilty, and acts unjustly;
but in real truth he does not act unjustly10;
and this is the equity of the case.
Now if equity be what it has been stated to be, it will be evident what kind of things are equit­ able, and what not so ;
also what kind of persons are not equitable.
Since in whatever cases one is bound to have a fellow-feeling, these are all cases of equity.
Again, equity is the not esteeming faults and crimes of equal guilt, nor accidents, and faults.
Now acci­ dents are whatever things happen against all calcula­ tion, and proceed not from criminal principle ;
and faults are whatever things do not happen against cal­ culation, nor proceed from criminal principle ;
but crimes are whatever things, not falling out contrary to calculation, proceed from criminal principle;
for the things which are done through desire, proceed from criminal principle.
Equity also is the having a sympathy for human failings ;
and the having an eye, not to the laM, but to the lawgiver;
and not to the language, but to the intention of the lawgiver 11.
And not to the conduct, but to the principles of the agent;
not to his conduct in one particular, but to its whole tenor.
Not what kind of person he has been in this instance, but what he has always shown himself, or generally at least.
The having, too, a remembrance of the good one has received, rather than of the ill;
of the good one has received, rather than what one has done;
though injured, to endure it patiently;
to prefer a decision by argument, rather than by re­ course to action:
a wish to proceed to arbitration, rather than to judicial decision, tor the arbitrator looks to what is equitable, the judge to what is law;
and in order to this it was that arbitration was in­ troduced, in order, namely, that equity might prevail.
So far then for our distinctions on the subject of what is equitable.
THOSE acts of injustice are greater in degree, which proceed from the greater principle of injustice1;
and on this account the most trifling are the greatest;
as the charge which Callistratus laid against Melenopus, that he had defrauded the builders of the temple in his accounts, to the amount of three half farthings of consecrated property;
but in the case of justice, things are more or less just in a contrary ratio2.
Now these criteria arise from the actions virtually exceeding;
for he who stole three half farthings of consecrated money would cheat one in any thing.
The degree of an act of injustice is decided then, sometimes on this principle, at others on that of the harm done.
Those also are very flagrant, for which no punishment is an equivalent, but of which every one falls short;
as also that which there is no means of healing ;
for such a case is difficult and impracti­ cable :
also where the injured party can get no re­ dress in court;
for the evil is without cure, because chastisement and a judicial sentence are a cure.
If the party suffering, and who was wronged, hath grievously injured himself3;
for then the man who did the wrong deserves punishment in a still greater degree;
just as Sophocles said when pleading in be­ half of Euctemon, who, on being insolently assaulted, slew himself;
" that he would price the deed at no less cost than the sufferer had prized himself at."
Crimes, too, of which the present criminal has alone been guilty, or he first, or very few besides.
Also the being frequently guilty of the same enormity.
Any thing too on account of, which new prohibitory and penal statutes have been sought out, and intro­ duced ;
as at Argos they punish any one -on whose account a law may have been enacted, and those on account of whom the prison was erected.
That act or injustice also is greater, which is or a more brutal character.
That too which proceeds more immedi­ ately from malice aforethought.
That too which, as they hear of, people are affected by dread, rather than compassion.
And the rhetorical expedients for exaggeration are as follows;
—“ he hath swept away or overleaped many principles of justice," as oaths, the plighting of his hand, pledges of fidelity, and marriage contracts ;
for there is an excess by the ratio of many crimes.
And its being on the very spot where criminals receive punishment;
which they do who bear false witness;
for where would he not be ready to act wrong, if at least he does so even in the judgment hall4?
Those deeds too on which shame is most especially felt.
Also if the party has injured him at whose hands he has been benefited:
for he is guilty in more than one way, both in that he does him wrong, and in that he did not good to him.
Also the man who has violated the unwritten principles of right;
for it belongs to a man of supe­ rior excellence to be just unconstrainedly;
now what is of written prescript is done of necessity, but not so what is unwritten.
Taking it in another way, it is a feature of aggravation if it be in violation of written law;
for you may say, the man who is unjust in mat­ ters where is room for apprehending punishment, and on which loss attends, surely would be likely to be unjust in respect of matters on which no loss is con­ sequent.
Thus, then, the greater and less degrees of injustice have been treated of.
It comes next to the subject just treated of, for me to run over the proofs which are called inartificial;
because these are peculiar to judicial oratory1 .
And they are five in number, viz.
laws, witnesses, deeds, torture, oaths.
First, then, let me speak of Laws, in what way an orator, in exhorting or dissuading, and in accus­ ing or defending, is to turn them to his purpose.
Because it is plain, that if the written law be op­ posed to his case, he must avail himself of the uni­ versal law, and of topics of equity, as more absolutely just:
and he must argue that, really "to act to the best of his judgment2,” is to decline an implicit adher­ ence to written prescript:
he must insist, moreover, that equity remains for ever, and varies not at any time, neither does the universal law, for this is in conformity to nature ;
but that the written law does frequently vary;
whence it was said in the Antigone of Sophocles ;
for she is defending herself because she acted in opposition to the law of Creon, but not in opposition to the universal law3, "for these are not of this or of the next day merely, but ever exist;
their prescript would I, not for the sake of any one, —.” He must insist, also, that justice is some- thing substantially true and expedient, but not so that mere seeming of justice, so that neither is the written law, for it does not the duty of law.
And that the judge is, as it were, an assay-master, that he may distinguish between counterfeit and real ideas of justice.
And that it is the part of a better man to employ and abide by the unwritten law than the written.
He should also observe, if the law which stands in his way be at variance with any ap­ proved law, or be itself at variance with itself;
thus sometimes one law directs that whatever men shall have covenanted should be valid;
another forbids that they should covenant any thing contrary to the law.
Observe, also, whether it be equivocal, so that you may wrest it to your purpose, and discover to which construction either justice or expediency will best adjust itself;
then let him avail himself of that law.
And if the circumstances under which the law was enacted be no longer remaining 4, but the law itself is remaining, he should endeavour to make this clear, and battle against it on this ground.
But should the written law be in favour of his case, the orator then must state that the best of one's judgment" is in­ serted, not for the sake of a judge's deciding contrary to the law, but in order that, if he be ignorant of what the law directs, he may not forswear himself.
He should insist also, that no one chooses good in the abstract, but what is so to himself;
and that there is no difference between a law not enacted and one not put in force.
And he should observe that, in other arts, it advantages not for one to indulge himself in such over-wisdom;
as, for example, in respect of a physician ;
for there the errors of his physician do not so greatly hurt a man, as the habituating himself to disobey him who has the direction of his health.
And that the seeking to be wiser than the law, is the very thing which in well-approved laws is prohi­ bited.
And on the subject of laws let such be our distinctions.
But to the subject of Witnesses:
witnesses are twofold, some ancient, others modern 5, and of these some are partners in the risk, others are uninvolved in it.
I mean by ancient witnesses, both poets and all other illustrious persons whose decisions are open to the world;
as, for example, the Athenians em­ ployed Homer as their witness in the matter of Salamis;
and the people of Tenedos but recently employed Periander the Corinthian, against the people of Sigæum ;
Cleophon, also, employed the Elegies of Solon against Critias, saying, that the family of old time was a dissolute one, for Solon would never otherwise have said, " Go, bid my Critias, with his yellow locks, to listen to his father."
Such, then, are the witnesses on the subject of the past.
But, respecting the future, we have also soothsayers ;
thus Themistocles insisted that they were to engage by sea, alleging the expression the wooden wall6.
Moreover, proverbs also are testi­ monies, according to what has been stated above7;
as, if one were going to advise another not to make an old man his friend, the proverb testifies to that point, "Never benefit an old man ;
” also as to the taking off the children whose parents one has slain, it Foolish is he who having slain the father shall leave the son behind8.”
Modern witnesses are all those people of note who have passed an opi­ nion on any point;
for these their opinions are useful to those who are debating on the same ques­ tions ;
as Eubulus, for instance, in the trial against Chares, availed himself of that saying of Plato, in reference to Archibius, that the avowal of being wicked has gained ground in the city."
Also those who participate the risk, should they appear to falsify.
Witnesses, however, of this class, prove merely such points as these ;
whether the fact has or has not taken place ;
whether it be in existence or not;
but as to the further question of its character, they are not at all witnesses ;
on the questions, for instance, whe­ ther a thing be just or unjust, expedient or preju­ dica.
But witnesses who are at a distance are very credible, even touching questions of this nature.
But ancient witnesses are of supreme credibility10, because they are beyond the reach of corruption.
But in reference to testimony the following may be adduced as confirmations of proof, by the orator, namely, who has no witnesses :
it should be insisted that the judge ought to decide from probabilities, and that this is the spirit of his oath, " to the best of his judgment."
Let him also say that it is im­ possible to lead probability astray on the score of money;
and that probability never is detected bear­ ing false testimony.
But it must be urged by him who has witnesses, against him who has them not, that neither is probability amenable to trial;
and that there would be no need at all of offering testi­ mony, if it were enough to consider matters on the ground of reasonings only.
And testimony is partly in reference to one's self, partly in reference to the adversary ;
partly to fact, partly to moral character.
Insomuch that it is plain that we can never be at a loss for testimony to suit our purpose ;
for if there be not at hand any such testimony, bearing on the case itself, as is either admitted on our own part, or opposed to our adversary, we still may have enough, bearing on the subject of moral character, with a view either to our own excellence of character, or our adversary s depravity.
Whatever else we allege on the subject of witnesses, as to their being friendly, inimical, or indifferent, of good character, or bad, or neither particularly, and whatever other distinctions of this kind there happen to be, must be alleged from the same places out of which we adduce enthymems.
But on the subject of Deeds, pleading is useful so far as regards enhancing or depreciating their au­ thority, or showing them to be valid, or void ;
in show­ ing, if they exist on your own side, that they are de­ serving credit and valid ;
if, however, they be on your adversary s side, in showing the contrary.
Now in order to set them out as deserving credit or undeserv­ ing it, there is no difference from the process respect­ ing witnesses.
For of whatever characters those who have subscribed, or had the custody of the deeds, happen to be, of the same authority will the deeds themselves also be.
When, however, the deeds are acknowledged to have been made, we must, in case they be on our side, aggrandize their authority;
for a deed is law, private and particular 12.
And deeds do not make valid the law, but the law makes valid those deeds which are conformable to law.
And, in short, the law is itself a sort of deed ;
so that who­ ever casts discredit on, or does away deeds, does away, in fact, with law.
Moreover the greater part of the bargains of men, and their voluntary transactions, are carried on by means of deeds:
so that if these become invalid, the intercourse of mankind with each other is subverted.
And it is easy enough to discover what other topics are adapted to the purpose.
But should the deeds be opposed to you, and on the side of your adversary, these arguments will be to your purpose:
—first, those with which one would contend against a law which made against him ;
for it is absurd if we think we are not bound to obey the laws, unless well enacted, and if the legislators have been guilty of mis­ taking their point, but yet hold it necessary to abide by mere deeds.
Next to argue that the judge is an arbiter of what is just, that he ought therefore to re­ gard, not the matter of the deed, but something par­ taking more of justice.
And that it is not possible to alter what is just, either by fraud or force ;
for it has an existence in the nature of things13:
deeds, how- ever, are made both by persons who are imposed on, and those who are compelled to make them.
Observe, moreover, whether it be in opposition to any written law, or any universal principle of right, and to the principles of justice and honour;
whether again it be opposed to other later or earlier deeds;
for either the later are valid, and the earlier invalid ;
or the earlier are correct, and the later have been obtained by stratagem;
urging whichever of these cases may happen to suit the purpose.
Have an eye moreover to the matter of expediency, whether the deed stand in any respect in the way of the judges, and every other such consideration, for these may also be easily discovered.
Torture is a kind of evidence, and appears to carry with it absolute credibility, because a kind of con­ straint is applied.
Now, it is not at all difficult re­ specting this to discern those considerations which the cause admits of, and to set them forth ;
out of which, should the torture be on our side, it is possi­ ble to enhance its value, by insisting that of all evi- dence this alone is true.
Should it be, however, op­ posed to us, and on the side of our adversary, one may do away with the very truth, by declaiming against every sort of torture;
for that men, when constrained, speak falsehood no less than truth, and will persist in not speaking the truth;
and will easily falsify, as being likely the sooner to get off:
14 and one ought to have it in his power to allege, over and above all these considerations, some actual instances, which the judges are acquainted with, besides topics such as I have described.
On the subject of oaths we may make a four-fold division ;
for a party either tenders an oath, and ac­ cepts it;
or he does neither ;
or he does the one, and not the other;
that is, he either tenders, but does not accept it;
or accepts, but does not tender it.15
Moreover, it may happen in a different way from this still, supposing the oath to have been previously taken by this or that party.
1.
Now, an advocate does not tender an oath on the ground that men easily forswear themselves ;
and because the other party will take it, and never repay;
but that he is of opinion that the judges, if his ad- versary does not take the oath, will give a verdict against him :
that he esteems the risk which depends on the judges the preferable one, for in them he re­ poses confidence, but in his adversary, none.
2.
But an advocate declines accepting it on the ground of its being an oath for a pecuniary object;
and because, if he were a worthless fellow, he would forswear himself without more ado;
since it were better surely to be a villain for some object, rather than for none;
for if he but take the oath, he will gain his cause, if he decline taking it, he will not.
Thus, then, his not taking it will be from virtuous motives, not from fear of forswearing himself;
here, too, the saying of Xenophanes is in point, viz. that this sort of appeal, made by an impious man to a pious, is not fair, but is just such an one, as if a ro­ bust fellow were to challenge an infirm man, either to strike him, or to get beaten himself.
3.
If, however, he accepts it, the advocate alleges that he feels confidence in himself, but none in his adversary.
Let him also declare, inverting the saying of Xenophanes, that it is fair enough if the impious man tenders the oath, and the pious man takes it;
also, that it is surely a strange thing that a man should be unwilling himself to take an oath, in a question about which he calls on the judges to give their verdict on oath.
4.
If, however, he tenders the oath, let him insist that a willingness to intrust the question to the gods is a matter of piety;
and that his adversary need call on no other judges, since he throws the decision of the case into his own hands;
and that an unwill­ ingness to take an oath, in a question about which he calls upon other people to swear, is absurd.
Now, as it is thus plain how we are to speak in reference to each [of the four simple cases, it will also be plain how we are to speak when taking them conjointly;
supposing, for instance, either that your­ self are willing to take the oath, but not to tender it;
or, if you tender it, but are not willing to take it;
or if you are inclined both to take it and to tender it;
or to do neither;
for these cases must be made up of those above mentioned, so that our reasonings must also be made up of those above stated.
But if a former oath, and that contradictory of your present, has been taken by yourself, you have to make out that it is not perjury;
for injustice is essentially voluntary, and perjury is injustice;
but that which is done under constraint, or deceit, is involuntary, [and therefore not unjust.]
Here then we may introduce the saying about perjury, viz. " that it is a thing not of the tongue, but of the mind."
If, however, an oath of this description shall have been taken by your adversary, declare, "that he who abides not by what he has sworn to, subverts every thing which is established;
for this is the rea­ son that judges administer the law only on oath:
" exclaim, too, " that these men are calling on you, judges, to abide by those oaths, by virtue of taking which you give your verdict;
and do they not them­ selves abide by them ? "
And whatever else one may allege in way of amplification.
So much, then, for the subject of proof not originated by art.
THE materials, then, from which we must exhort and dissuade, praise and blame, accuse and defend, the notions also and propositions, useful in order to render these points credible, are those [which we have discussed] :
for respecting these questions, and out of these sources, are enthymems deduced, so that an orator, thus provided, may speak on each separate department of questions.
But as rhetoric has in view the coming to a decision (for in deliberative oratory, the assembly arrive at decisions;
and the sentence of a court of justice is ipso facto a decision) ;
it is necessary to look not only to your speech, in what way that will be of a character to convince and persuade, but also to invest yourself with a certain kind of character, and the judge with a certain kind of feeling.
For it is a point of great consequence, particularly in deliberative cases ;
and, next to these, in judicial;
as well that the speaker seem to be a man of a certain character, as that his audience conceive him to be of a certain disposition toward themselves;
moreover it is of consequence if your audience chance to be themselves also disposed in a certain way.
Now, as to a speaker's appearing to be himself of a certain character, this point is more available in de­ liberations :
but the disposing the auditor in a certain way, in judicial cases ;
for things do not show them­ selves in the same light to persons affected by love and by hatred, nor to those under emotions of anger, as to those who are disposed to placability;
but they appear either utterly different in character, or at least different in degree.
For to a judge who is affected by love toward the party respecting whom he pro­ nounces his decision, that party appears either not at all to be unjust, or to be so in a very trivial degree.
To a judge, however, who is affected by hatred, the case has a contrary appearance.
So also to a person who is eager and sanguine, the proposed object, if pleasant, takes the appearance, as well of being likely to accrue, as of being likely to prove really a good ;
while by one who is indifferent and reluctant, the opposite view is taken.
Now, there are three causes of a speakers deserv­ ing belief;
for so many in number are the qualities on account of which we lend our credit, independent­ ly of proof adduced;
and these are prudence, moral excellence, and the having our interests at heart2;
(for men are fallacious in what they allege or advise by reason, either of all, or some, of these causes;
for either, from want of ability, they do not rightly ap­ prehend the question;
or, rightly apprehending it, from their depravity, they do not tell you what they think;
or, being men both of ability and moral ex­ cellence, they have not your interests at heart, on which account it is possible they should not give you the best advice, though fully known what is best;
) and besides these there is no other :
it follows there­ fore, of course, that the speaker who appears to pos­ sess all these qualities, is considered by his audience as deserving credit.
Now the means by which men may appear virtuous and prudent, are to be derived from what has been laid down on the subject of the virtues;
for it is by help of the very same things, that an orator may invest himself and any one else, in a certain character.
The subject of feeling an in- terest, and of friendliness, must be discussed in my treatise of the passions, commencing henceforth.
Passions4 however are, all emotions whatsoever, on which pain and pleasure are consequent, by whose operation, undergoing a change, men differ in respect to their decisions:
for instance, anger, pity, fear, and whatever other emotions are of such a nature, and those opposed to them.
But it will be fitting to divide what I have to say, respecting each, into three considerations;
to consider, respecting anger, for ex­ ample, how those who are susceptible of anger are affected;
with whom they usually are angry;
and on what occasions.
For, granted that we be in pos­ session of one, or even two of these points, and not of them all, it will be impossible for us to kindle anger in the breast;
and in the case of the rest of the passions in a similar way.
In the same way, then, as on the subjects treated of above I have separately drawn up the several propositions, so let me do in re­ spect of these also, and make my distinctions ac­ cording to the manner specified.
LET anger be defined1 to be “a desire accompanied by pain of a revenge which presents itself, on ac­ count of an apparent slight from persons acting to­ ward one's self, or some of one's friends, unbecom- ingly."
Now, if anger be this, it must be that he who is affected by anger, is so affected invariably to­ wards some individual (for instance, towards Cleon), but not towards mankind2, generally:
and this, be­ cause the individual has already wrought some indig­ nity, either on himself or some of his friends, or in- tends doing so.
It must be also that there is a sort of pleasure consequent on all anger, arising out of the hope of avenging one's self3;
for the idea of at­ taining what one desires is pleasant;
and no one is desirous of objects which appear impracticable to him;
and he who is under the affection of anger is desirous of objects which appear practicable to him.
Where­ fore it has been happily remarked of anger, that it is, " Far, far too dear to every mortal breast, Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste4.”
Because a sort of pleasure is consequent on it, as well on this account, as because men linger in thought on compassing revenge.
Now the phantasy which then arises excites a pleasure within us, as do the phanta- sies of dreams.
But as a slight is the operation of an opinion conceived of an object which appears not worth consideration (for we esteem things absolutely bad, and those which are good, and what conduces to them, to be worth some consideration;
that however which is mere nothing, or absolutely trivial, we con- ceive worth none).
There are three species of slight, contempt, vexatiousness, and contumely:
for he who manifests contempt is guilty of a slight, since men contemn whatever they think worth nothing, and what is worth nothing, they slight.
Again, he who is vexatious appears to contemn, for vexatiousness is a thwarting another s wishes, not that any thing may accrue to the person himself who so impedes, but in order that something may not accrue to that other.
Since, then, he slights not with a view to any ad­ vantage to himself, it is plain that he conceives you can neither hurt him, (for, if he did, he would be afraid, and would not be guilty of slight,) nor can benefit him in any respect worth mentioning, since he would otherwise hold you in consideration, in order to become your friend.
5
He, too, who acts contume- liously manifests slight;
for contumely is the doing and saying those things about which the person who is the subject of this treatment, has feelings of deli­ cacy, not with a view that any thing should accrue to himself, other than what arises to him in the act, but in order that he may be gratified;
for they who requite an injury, do not act contumeliously, but take revenge.
Now the cause of the pleasure felt by those who act contumeliously, is that, by injuring, they conceive themselves to be more decidedly superior:
on which account young men and the rich are given to contumely, for in manifesting the contumely, they conceive themselves superior.
To contumely belongs the withholding of respect;
but he who withholds respect, manifests slight;
for that which is of no value, is held in no consideration, either good or bad.
On which principle Achilles, in his anger, says, " He bath withheld from me respect, for he hath seized and possesses my prize himself, having taken it from me."
And again, " Like some unregarded vaga­ bond ;
” as though he were, on this account, affected by anger.
Now people think it becoming that they should be looked up to by their interiors, whether in birth, power, or moral excellence, or generally speaking, in whatever respect one may happen to be much superior:
thus the rich man thinks to be looked up to by the poor, in regard to money;
also the man who has a faculty of speaking, by him who is desti­ tute of it, in the case of speaking;
and he who thinks himself worthy to bear office, by him who deserves to be subject to rule.
Whence it has been said, " Beware !
for dreadful is the wrath of kings and in another place, " 'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last for they feel indignant by reason of their superiority.
Moreover [men think it becoming that they should be looked up to] by those at whose hands they think they ought to receive good;
and these are such as they have benefited, or continue to benefit, whether in their own persons, or as instruments of any one, and whom any of their relatives have benefited, or wish, or did wish to benefit.
1.
From hence it is by this time manifest both un­ der what affections as regards themselves, and with what objects, and for what reasons, men feel anger.
For as regards themselves, it is when they happen to be aggrieved, since he who is aggrieved is anxious for something.
Now a man [will feel thus aggrieved], as well on any person's clashing with him in regard to any object, directly;
when he is thirsty;
for exam­ ple, in regard to drinking:
as also should they not directly clash, yet will he appear to do the same thing;
and if a person thwarts, or does not co-operate with one, and if a person annoys one in any respect, when thus circumstanced, one feels anger against all these.
On which account people who are ill, in poverty, love, thirst, in a word, who are under desire, and fail of success, these all are fretful and irritable, and parti­ cularly with those who slight their present condition:
the sick man, for example, is annoyed by those who slight him in regard to his disease:
the poor man too, with those who do so in regard to his poverty;
and the warrior, in regard to war;
the lover, in regard to love;
and in other cases similarly, for each one has the way paved to the feeling anger in each case, by the passion which exists in his mind.
Again, a man is nettled should he happen to be expecting the very opposite of what results;
for that pains one more deeply which falls out very unexpectedly;
just in the same ratio as that which is very unexpected de­ lights, should it be what one wishes for.
On which account seasons, times, dispositions, and ages, which class of them are readily excited to anger, and when, and how, will be plain from this which I have said ;
also it will be plain that they are then excited with greater readiness, when more immediately influenced by these circumstances.
As then regards the persons themselves, under these dispositions it is that they are readily excited to anger.
2.
But people feel anger towards those who laugh at them excessively, and gibe, and scoff at them, for these treat them with contumely;
with such also as hurt them in all particulars, of such a nature as are tokens of contumely:
these of course must be such as neither are in requital for any thing, or beneficial to those who are the agents 6;
for this is enough to make it appear to be an act solely of contumely:
towards those also who underrate and despise what themselves take a warm interest in;
thus all those who are fond of philosophy, are angry if any one undervalues phi­ losophy ;
so, too, they who embrace the notion of an universal idea7, are nettled if a person despises the doctrine;
and as regards other things in a similar manner.
But all this will be felt much more keenly, if these persons suspect that the qualities so under­ rated do not really belong to them, or not completely, or not firmly, or that they do not appear to belong to them;
since, if they conceive themselves to be very strong in the points on which they happen to be ral­ lied, they do not regard its, and anger is felt to- wards friends, in a greater degree than towards such as are not friends;
because people conceive it to be more fitting to receive good at their hands than not:
also towards those who have been in the habit of honouring or bestowing consideration on them, if, on the contrary, they do not keep on the same terms with them;
because people conceive themselves de­ spised by them, for otherwise they would do as be- fore.
Towards those also who do not requite a kind­ ness, or who do not return an equivalent, towards those also who thwart them, if they be inferiors ;
for these all appear to despise them, the latter as though they were their inferiors, the former as though [the kindness had been received] from inferiors.
Men feel it also in a greater degree towards persons of no account, should they slight them;
for anger is sup­ posed to arise from a slight, and to exist towards persons whose conduct misbecame them ;
now it be­ comes inferiors to make no manifestation of slight.
Towards friends, anger is felt if they do not or speak not well;
and still more so if they do the contrary;
also if they should not perceive us to be in want, just as the Plexippus9 of Antipho was angry with Meleager;
for not to perceive this is a token of slight, since in regard to those for whom we feel deference, this does not escape our notice:
towards those also it is felt who exult in their misfortunes;
and, in a word, towards such as are in good spirits amid their misfortunes;
for this marks either a foe, or one who manifests slight:
towards those also who do not care if they give us pain;
wherefore, men feel anger towards those who announce evil tidings10.
Against those also is anger felt who either readily listen to, or scrutinize our failings;
for they resemble persons who slight us, or who are our enemies;
since a friend sympathizes with one, and all men, as their peculiar failings are scrutinized, feel pain.
More- over men feel anger towards those who slight them in the presence of five descriptions of persons, viz.
in the presence of those whom they emulate, whom they admire, by whom they are desirous of being ad­ mired, in whose presence they are alive to delicacy of feeling, and before those who have a delicacy of feeling towards them ;
if before these any one should slight them, they feel anger more sensibly:
with those also do men feel angry who slight them in such respects, as it is disgraceful for them not to stand up in defence of;
in regard to parents, for instance, or children, wives, or persons in subjection:
with those, too, who make no return of favours;
for the slight then is contrary to what is becoming :
and with those who play off sarcasms upon them when seriously en­ gaged ;
for sarcasm has an air of contempt:
also with those who benefit others, if they do not also benefit them;
since this also carries an air of contempt, the not thinking them worthy what all are worthy of.
Also the letting a man escape our memory is a thing very apt to provoke anger;
for example, the nearly forgetting even his name, since forgetfulness seems to be an indication of slight;
because forgetfulness arises from disregard, and disregard is a kind of slight.
Now, it has been told you against whom men feel anger, and under what dispositions, and why11.
It evidently will be needful for an orator to work up his audience by his speech, into such a frame of mind as that under which men are prone to anger, and his adversary, too, as being obnoxious to that on account of which men feel anger, and as being such an one as people feel anger against.
As the feeling anger is the opposite of being ap­ peased, and anger ltselt ot placability, we must as­ certain with what dispositions men are placable, towards whom they are thus affected, and by what means they are appeased.
Let placability, then, be defined to be " a subsiding and appeasement of anger 1.”
Now, if men feel anger towards those who slight them, and if slight be voluntary, it is plain that they are placable in regard to those who do no such thing, or who either do so, or appear to do so, involuntarily :
towards those also who wish the contrary of what they do;
and those who behave in the same way toward themselves also, for no one seems likely him- self to be guilty of slight towards himself.
Men are thus disposed also towards such as acknowledge and repent of their guilt;
for taking their feeling of pain for what they have done as a punishment, they are appeased :
-there is proof of this in the case of chastising servants ;
for we chastise more vio­ lently those who contradict us, and deny their guilt;
but towards such as acknowledge themselves to be justly punished, we cease from our wrath2;
the rea­ son of which is, that the denial of what is evident is a sort of impudence, and impudence is slight and contempt:
therefore we are not alive to sense of shame, in regard to those whom we despise very much.
Men are thus disposed also towards those who humble themselves before them3, and do not contradict their imputations ;
for they appear to ac­ knowledge themselves inferior ;
but inferiors fear us, and no one who fears is guilty of slight.
But the fact that anger ceases towards such as humble themselves, even dogs evince by their not biting those who sit as suppliants.
Placability is also felt towards such as are earnestly attentive, where they are themselves attentive;
for they think themselves regarded with attention, and not despised :
towards such as [subsequently to their manifesting slight] have gratified us in more important points, and with those who implore us, and deprecate our anger;
for these are more humble:
towards those also, who are not given to contumely, nor to jeering one;
and who do not manifest slight towards any one, or to­ wards those alone who are not good men, and not towards such as we ourselves are.
In a word, we should consider the subject of placability, from the opposite of the doctrine of anger.
Once more, it is felt towards those whom men fear, or have a delicacy toward ;
for so long as they are thus affected, they are not influenced by anger;
since it is impossible to feel anger and fear at the same time.
Again, people either do not feel anger at all, or feel it in a less degree, towards those who have themselves act­ ed under the influences of anger ;
for these appear to have acted, not from any motive of slight;
for no one who is angry with you slights you ;
since slight is unattended by pain, anger, however, is so attend­ ed.
Thus are they also disposed towards such as re­ gard them with respect.
It is evident, also, that men are placable, when in a frame of mind contrary to the feeling of anger ;
thus in amusements, in mirth, in festivity, amid rejoicings, or a course of success and of gratification, or, in a word, when in a state of freedom from pain, and amid chastened pleasure and virtuous hope.
Those, too, who have suffered some time to elapse, and are not fresh from the influence of anger;
for time makes anger ceased
Also vengeance previously taken on one object allays the anger felt against another, even if he be more violent.
For which reason, Philocrates, when some one asked him " how it was, as the popu­ lace were enraged with him, that he did not make his defence," very justly said, "I will not do it yet.”— "But when will you?”—“I will do it, when I see some one else criminated."
For people, after they have exhausted their anger on some other object, become placable ;
which happened in the case of Er­ gophilus;
for the populace, though more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, yet acquitted him, because, on the day before, they had condemned Cal- listhenes to death.
Men are thus disposed if they have convicted the object, and if he have suffered a greater ill than they, with all their anger, would have themselves inflicted;
for they think they have got­ ten, as it were, their revenge.
Again, if they are aware that they are themselves unjust, and suffer de- servingly5;
because anger is not felt at what is just;
for in that case men no longer conceive themselves sufferers contrary to what is becoming;
but anger was defined to be such a feeling.
On which account we should preface punishment with a sort of lecture ;
for thus even slaves feel less indignant at being pun- ished.
Moreover they are thus disposed, if they conceive that the sufferer will not perceive that he is punished by them, and in return for what they have have suffered;
for anger is felt against individuals:
and this is plain from the definition.
Hence is it said in the poem with great propriety, " Go, say 'twas Ulysses, subverter of cities," etc.;
as though the hero had not been revenged, unless Polyphemus perceived both by whom6, and in return for what7, he suffered.
So that men are not angry with any who are no longer sensible;
neither any longer with those who are dead8, as being persons who have endured the extremity of suffering ;
nor with those who will not be susceptible of pain, nor feel the punishment inflicted, a point of which those affected by anger are desirous.
On which account the poet, wishing to restrain Achilles from his anger against Hector now that he is dead, aptly says, “In his madness he is vexing a senseless clod."
It is evident that arguments must be deduced from the topics here furnished, by those who would appease their audience;
by working up the hearers themselves into feelings such as I have described;
and those with whom they are enraged, either as ob­ jects of fear, or as deserving reverence, or as persons who have benefited them, or as having been involun­ tary agents, or as now exceedingly pained at what they have done.
LET us discuss the characters towards whom men bear friendly feelings, and hatred, and the reasons why they do so;
setting out with a definition of friendliness and the act of cherishing this feeling.
Let the bearing friendly feeling, then, be defined to be "the wishing a person what we think good, for his sake and not for our own, and, as far as is in our power, the exerting ourselves to procure it."
And a friend is he who entertains and meets a return of this feeling.
1
And those people consider themselves friends who consider themselves to stand thus affected towards each other.
These considerations being laid down, of necessity it must be, that one who participates in another's joy at good fortune, and in his sorrow at what aggrieves him, not from any other motive, but simply for his sake, is his friend.
For every one, when that hap­ pens which he wishes, rejoices;
but when the con­ trary happens, all are grieved.
So that the pain and pleasure men feel are an indication of their wishes.
Those, too, are friends, to whom the same things are become by this time good, and the same evil;
those, too, who are friends and foes to the same persons, for these must necessarily desire similar objects.
So that he who wishes for another what he does for himself, appears to be a friend to that other.
Men love also those who have benefited either themselves, or those for whom they have a regard;
whether in important particulars, or with readiness 2, and for their own sakes, or those whom they deem willing to benefit them.
Again, people love the friends of their friends, and such as cherish friendly feelings towards those for whom they do themselves;
likewise those who are loved by such as are beloved by themselves;
those also who are enemies to the same people, and who hate those whom they hate themselves, and those who are hated by those who also are hated by themselves;
for to all these the same objects seem good as to themselves;
so that they wish for things which are good to them, both which were laid down to be characteristic of a friend.
Moreover men love those who benefit them in regard to money matters, and the security of life;
on which account people honour the liberal and brave.
They love also the just, of which character they esteem those who do not live at the cost of others, such are all who are supported by their bodily labour, and of these are husbandmen, and among the rest handicraftsmen in particular.
They love also the temperate, for they are not unjust;
and those who are disengaged from business, for the same reason.
We love also those or whom we wish to become the triens, should they appear to desire it also.
Of this sort are those who are good in respect to moral excellence, and men of approved character, either among all men, or among the best men, or those who are held in admir­ ation by ourselves, or who themselves admire us.
Again, we love those who are pleasant companions for passing time, or spending a day with;
of this description are the good-tempered, and such as are not fond of chiding those who err, and are not quarrelsome or contentious3.
For all people of this sort are fond of dispute;
but such as are fond of dispute give us the idea of desiring the opposite of what we do.
Also those who have a happy turn in passing and taking a joke ;
for both seem bent on the same things as their neighbours, being able both to endure being rallied and neatly rallying others 4.
Men love also those who praise their good qualities, and particularly such as they apprehend not to belong to them:
also those who are neat in their appearance, their dress, and their whole manner of living.
Also those who do not reproach them with errors, nor their own benefits;
for both these descriptions of people have an air of reproving them.
People admire also those who forget old grievances;
and who do not treasure up grounds of quarrel, but are easily re­ conciled ;
because of whatever disposition they show themselves towards others, people naturally think they will prove to be of towards themselves also:
as also those who do not talk scandal, nor inform themselves of the ills either of their neighbours or themselves, but of their good points only;
for this is the con- duct of a good man.
We are friendly disposed also towards those who are not at cross purposes with us when angry, or seriously engaged;
for all such people are fond of dispute:
towards those also who comport themselves seriously towards us;
thus, for instance, those who admire us, or consider us worthy men, and take a pleasure in our society, and who are thus affected in regard particularly to points about which ourselves are desirous to be admired, or to a- pear excellent or agreeable:
as also towards our equals, and those who have the same objects in view, supposing they do not clash with us5, and that their livelihood arise not from the same profession, for thus arises an instance of the proverb, " Potter hates pot­ ter6.”
We stand thus affected towards those also who are desirous of the same objects with ourselves, and which it is possible for us to participate in as well as them;
otherwise the same collision takes place in this case:
towards those also, in regard to whom men have themselves in such a way as, while they do not hold them cheap, not to feel shame on mere matters of opinion.
With this feeling do peo- ple regard those also in respect to whom they feel shame about matters really shameful:
and those be­ fore whom they are studious to stand approved, and by whom they wish to be emulated, yet without be­ ing envied, all these men either love as friends, or wish to become their friends;
also those with whom they would co-operate toward some good, were it not that greater ills are likely thereby to befall them­ selves:
and such as regard with friendly feeling, the absent equally with the present;
on which account all love those who manifest this disposition in regard to the dead.
Also men entirely love those who are particularly zealous for their friends and never aban­ don them ;
for eminently beyond all the good, people love those who are good as friends.
They also love those who do not dissemble towards them;
of this class are such as mention their own failings;
for it has been said already, that before friends we feel no shame about mere matters of opinion;
if, then, he who is so ashamed has not the feelings of a friend, the man who is without such shame bears a resem­ blance to one who has friendly feelings.
Also we love those who do not inspire us with fear, and be­ fore whom we feel confidence;
for no one loves a person whom he fears 7. But the species of friend- ship are companionship, intimacy, relationship, and the like.
And the efficient causes of friendship are gratuitous benefits, the rendering a service unsoli­ cited, and the not disclosing it after it has been ren- dered ;
for thus done the favour appears to be solely for the sake of your friend himself, and from no other motive.
The subject of hatred, however, and of bearing it, may, it is plain, be considered by taking the contra­ ries.
But the efficient causes of hatred are anger, vexatiousness, calumny.1.
Now anger arises out of something which has reference to ourselves;
hatred, however, even inde­ pendently of any thing having reference to ourselves, since if we conceive a person to be of a certain de­ scription, we bear hatred towards him.
2. And our anger invariably has reference to individual objects, as to Callias 8 or Socrates ;
but hatred may be borne even to whole classes;
for every one hates the cha­ racter of a thief and an informer.
3. Again, the one feeling is to be remedied by time;
the other is in­ curable.
4. Also the first is a desire of inflicting pain on its object, the last of doing him deadly harm;
for the angry man wishes to be felt 9, to him who bears hatred this matters not;
and all things which give pain may be felt;
but what does harm in the highest degree, is least capable of being felt, for instance, in­ justice and folly, for the presence of vice does not at all pain [him to whom it is present].
5. And anger is attended by pain, hatred is not;
for he who is affect­ ed by anger is pained, but he who is affected by hatred is not.
6. The former, too, had many ills befallen the object of his anger, might be inclined to pity him;
the latter would not, in any case;
for the former wishes the object of his anger to suffer in his turn, the latter desires the extinction of the object of his hate10.
Out of these heads, then, it is plain that the orator may both prove those to be friends and enemies who really are such, and .render such those who are not, and may do away the assertions of people on the subject, and may draw over those who hesitate whether an act was done from motives of anger or hatred, to whatsoever side he may fix on.
THE sort of things which men fear, and the persons whom, and under what affections as regards them­ selves, will thus become plain.
Now, let fear be de­ fined to be "
A sort of pain or agitation, arising out of an idea that an evil, capable either of destroying or giving pain, is impending on us."
People do not fear every evil1;
for example, a man does not fear lest he shall become unjust or stupid;
but people fear all those evils whose effect is either a considerable degree of pain, or destruction, and these, provided they be not far removed, but give one the idea of being close at hand, so as to be on the eve of hap­ pening2;
for they do not fear that which is very far off:
for all know that they shall die;
but since the event is not near, they pay no attention to it.
If then fear be this, it must follow that all those things are to be feared which appear to possess great power either of destroying, or of hurting, in points whose tendency is toward considerable pain.
On which account even the symptoms of such things are alarming, for the evil appears to be at hand;
since this in fact is danger, viz. " the approach of what excites fear."
Of this description, however, are both the hatred and the anger of those who have it in their power to do us any harm 3;
for it is evident that they have both the will and the power, so that they are not far from doing it.
Also injustice, possessed of power;
for [it is evident that it does not want inclin­ ation to do harm] since it is from settled inclination that the unjust man is unjust.
Also insulted virtue, invested with power;
for it is evident that, invaria­ bly, when it is insulted, it determines on a requital, and now it has the power of exacting one.
The fear also of those who have the power of doing us any harm, is itself an object to be dreaded;
for any one, in such circumstances, will of course be pre­ pared against us.
But as men in general are depraved, and may be prevailed on by gain, and are timid amid dangers;
it is, generally speaking, a fearful thing to be at the disposal of another.
So that accomplices in any deed of guilt are to be feared, lest either they should denounce you, or abandon you to trial.
Also those who have the power to act unjustly, are always ob­ jects of fear to such as may be attacked by injustice ;
for, in nine cases out of ten, a man when he has the power, perpetrates the injustice.
Also those who have been wronged4, or who conceive themselves to have been wronged;
tor they are ever on the watch for an opportunity [of retaliating].
Also those who have wronged others 5, if possessed of power, are to be feared, from their apprehension of being retaliated on ;
for cases of this kind were laid down to be such as to excite alarm.
Those, too, who are rivals for the same objects, and which it is not possible should accrue to both, for people are ever at variance with those towards whom they stand on this footing.
Those who are objects of fear to our superiors, are also objects of fear to ourselves;
for much more will they be able to injure us, than our superiors:
and for the same reason [we needs must fear those] whom our superiors fear 6.
Men dread those also who have already annihilated persons superior to themselves;
and those who have attacked their inferiors;
for, either they are already deserving fear, or they will become so by being aggrandized in power.
And among those who have been wronged, or are enemies, or opponents, it is not the passionate, and those who speak their minds freely, who are to be dreaded ;
but the mild, the dissembling, and the insidious ;
for they give us to doubt, whether they be not close upon us, so that they are never clearly known to be too far off to reach us.
But all those circumstances which excite fear, have a still greater tendency to do so, in respect of which should a man have committed a mistake, it is not pos­ sible for him to recover himself, but which either are impracticable altogether, or which cannot be correct­ ed by himself, but by his enemies only:
as have those also which we have no means, or no easy means, of averting.
So that, to speak generally, all those things are to be feared, which, happening or being likely to happen in the case of others, excite compassion.
The circumstances then of fear, and which men are alarm­ ed at, those at least of greatest importance, are, as I may say, nearly those which I have enumerated:
and now let me state under what dispositions, as regards themselves, men are susceptible of fear.
Now, if fear be attended by an apprehension of suffering some destructive evil, it is plain that none of those who consider that they shall not suffer any thing, is subject to fear;
and that no one is subject to it, in regard to those things which he does not con­ sider that he shall suffer;
nor in regard to those persons at whose hands he does not apprehend any thing;
nor at a time when he is without apprehen­ sions.
It must follow, therefore, that those are sub­ ject to fear, who apprehend they shall suffer some­ thing, and this in regard to the persons at whose hands, and the things which, and at the times when, they so apprehend.
But neither are those who are, and who think themselves to be, in the midst of great good fortune, at all apprehensive of suffering any thing, (on which account they are contumelious, con­ temptuous, and rash;
but it is wealth, strength, number of friends, power, which renders men of this temper,) nor those who think that already they have suffered the sum of all that is horrible 7, and whose feelings have been chilled with respect to what awaits them, just as those who have been already beaten on the rack;
but [in order to the existence of fear] there must needs arise some hope of safety, about which men feel the painful anxiety8;
and this is a proof of it, that fear makes men deliberate;
and yet no one deliberates about that which is utterly hope­ less.
So that, when it shall better serve our cause that the audience be affected by fear, we must set them off as persons liable to suffer, inasmuch as others of greater power have suffered, and also to show that their equals are or have been exposed to sufferings;
and this, at the hands of persons from whom they would not have apprehended it, and such things, and at times when they would not have apprehended it.
But since on the subject of fear, it is plain what it is ;
and on the subject of things exciting fear, and also with what dispositions men experience it;
from this it will be plain both what confidence is, and on what points men are confident, and with what dis­ positions ;
for both confidence itself is the opposite of fear, and what inspires it is the opposite of what ex­ cites fear;
so that it is the hope of things conducive to safety, accompanied by an idea that they are near;
and of things to be feared, that they either do not exist, or are at a distance.
But these are circumstances inspiring confidence;
to have danger afar off, and that in which we may confide, near:
also means of recovering from, or of averting loss, whether these be numerous, or valua- ble, or both:
again, should we never have been in­ jured, nor have ourselves injured others;
also, if we have no rival at all;
or should those we have, be de­ void of power;
or, supposing they have power, should they be our friends ;
or should they have benefited us, or have been themselves benefited by us;
or should those, to whom the same things are an object as to ourselves, be more numerous than those to whom they are not, or more powerful, or both at once.
But, as regards themselves, people feel confidence when thus affected :
should they conceive themselves to have been often successful, and this without hav­ ing suffered;
or should they often have fallen into danger, and have escaped9:
for there are two ways in which men become dead to apprehension, either from never having experienced, or from being pos­ sessed of resources against calamity;
just as, in the case of danger by sea, both those who never expe­ rienced a storm feel confidence as to the result, and those who from their experience possess resources against it.
Men feel it also, when the case does not alarm their equals, nor their inferiors, nor those to whom they conceive themselves superior ;
but they conceive thus of those whom, either absolutely in their own persons, or virtually in the persons of their su- periors or of their equals, they have overcome.
And again, if they conceive there belong to themselves, in greater number and degree, those things in which, when they have the advantage, men are objects of fear;
and these are, store of wealth, and strength in respect to retainers, and friends, and territory, and warlike preparation, either all together, or the most important of them.
Also, if they have not wronged any one, or not many, or not any of such a character as men are apprehensive of.
And, in a word, if their account stands well with heaven, as well in other re­ spects, as in what regards omens and oracles10:
be­ cause anger is a thing which inspires confidence;
and the being free from the commission of injustice, while you are wronged yourself, is productive of anger ;
and the deity is supposed to aid such as have been wronged.
[Once more, people feel confidence] when, being the first aggressors, they think they can suffer nothing, or shall not, or shall succeed at last.
And of the subject of what inspires confidence and fear, we have spoken.
THE points about which men feel delicate, or are in- sensible to such feelings, and towards whom, and with what dispositions, will be manifest from what follows.
Now, let sense of shame be defined to be " a kind of pain and agitation about evils present, past, or to come, which appear to tend to loss of cha­ racter."
And impudence to be, " a sort of neglect and callousness about these points.
"Now, if the sensibility defined be actually sensi- bility to shame, it must follow that a man is affected by it, on the occurrence of evils of a kind which ap­ pear to be disgraceful, either to himself, or those for whom he has a regard:
and such are all results of depravity whatsoever;
for example, the casting away one's shield, or the turning to flight, for this pro- ceeds from cowardice;
and the withholding a deposit1 from a person, for it is the result of injustice.
And that cohabitation with those with whom we ought not, or where, or when we ought not, [is a source of shame ;
] for it is the result of intemperance:
as is also the deriving gain from paltry, mean, or imprac­ ticable sources, as from the poor, for instance, or from the dead;
whence also the proverb, " to pillage even from the dead:
" for it is the result of a sordid hankering after lucre, and of meanness.
It is also a source of shame for a person, who has the means, not to contribute his aid in money matters, or to do so in a minor degree;
and for one to be assisted by those in less easy circumstances than himself;
and for one to borrow himself, when his friend appears to be asking a loan ;
and to ask a further loan, when he would recall a former;
and the recalling a former loan when he asks another ;
and the praising a thing to such a degree as to seem to ask for it;
and the persisting no less, though often foiled;
for these are all indications of meanness.
And the praising a person in his presence is a token of adulation;
and the praising a man's good points, while you slur over his failings ;
or, when one is grieved, the exhibiting grief in an inordinate degree, and whatever other conduct is of a similar kind, is a source of shame,] because it manifests adulation.
[It is also shameful] not to sustain toils which those who are advanced in years, or who live delicately, or who are of higher rank, or, in a word, which they sustain whose strength is inferior to your own;
because all these are indications of effeminacy:
and so it is to be be­ nefited by another, and that frequently;
or, to re- preach a person with his obligations to you;
for they are all indications of a mean and abject spirit.
Again, to talk about one's self, and to be one's own trumpeter;
and to assert that to be one's own which belongs to another;
for these are indications of arro­ gance.
In the same way, too, in the several other instances of moral depravity, both their results, their indications, and the like attendant circumstances, are all subjects of shame;
for they are disgraceful, and make one ashamed.
And to the afore-mentioned we may add, the non-participation in those creditable qualities which either every body, or all our equals, or the greatest part of them, partake of.
By equals I mean, fellow countrymen, citizens, those of the same age, relations;
in a word, those with whom we are on an equality ;
for [when a thing is so general] the non-participation in it begins to be disgraceful;
for instance, the not having been educated 2, at least in a certain degree, and so in the case of other deficiencies;
but the disgrace of all these things be­ comes much greater, should they appear to be want­ ing by our own fault;
for thus, they are more pro­ perly the result of depravity should one be himself the cause of what has attached to him, or does now, or is likely so to attach.
Again, men are sensible to feelings of shame, when they are suffering, have suf­ fered, or are about to suffer any thing of such a na­ ture, as tends to loss of respect, and disgrace:
and these are all services consisting in the lending one's self either personally, or in any shameful action where there is an idea of suffering insult:
and what­ ever administers to intemperance, whether it be vo­ luntary, or not:
and submission to violence, if invo- luntary;
for such submission, without defending one's self, proceeds from an unmanly character, and from cowardice.
These then, and the like to these, are the things about which men are sensible of shame.
But as the sense of shame is an idea entertained of loss of character;
and of this loss, in itself alone, with­ out reference to its consequences ;
and as no one re­ gards the opinion, except for the sake of those who hold it;
it must follow that a man is thus sensible in regard to those for whom he has an esteem.
But he will have an esteem for those who admire him, and whom he does himself admire, and by whom he wishes to be admired, and in regard to whom he feels emu­ lation, and whose opinion he does not hold cheap.
Now, people wish to be admired by, and do them­ selves admire, all those who possess any of those goods which are valued;
or from whom they happen to be very much in want of getting something of which they have the disposal;
for instance, those who are in love.
But people have their emulation excited, in reference to their equals;
and they hold in consi­ deration the prudent3, as being men who adhere to truth;
of this description are men of education, and such as are advanced in years.
Also actions done in the eyes of the world and in public [excite our shame], and hence the proverb, that " Shame dwells in the eyes."
On this account, people are more sensible of shame before those with whom they are always likely to be present, and those who fix their attention on them, for both these are instances of being before the eyes of persons:
—again, they are sensible of it be­ fore those who are not open to charges on the same points ;
for their sentiments, it is evident, are the op­ posite of their own:
before those also who do not make allowances for such as appear to be faulty;
for errors which a man commits himself ,these he is said not to take amiss in his neighbours;
so that he evi­ dently will take amiss such as he does not commit himself:
and before those who are fond of divulging what they know to the world;
for whether a man does not think one's conduct faulty, or does not divulge it, makes no difference.
But persons likely to di­ vulge [what they know to one's discredit] are such as have been injured, from their being anxiously on the watch to retaliate ;
and those who are slanderers generally;
for if they speak ill even of those who are not culpable, much more will they of those who are:
as are also those who are on the look-out for the errors of their neighbours, for instance, jesters, and the poets of the old comedy ;
for these are in some sense slanderers, and fond of divulging.
Again, [men are sensible of shame] before those with whom they never met with a repulse;
for they are disposed to­ wards them as admirers.
On which account men have a sense of shame, even towards those who ask any thing for the first time, as having never yet for­ feited their good opinion in any points.
And of this description are both those who have lately sought to be our friends, for they have observed our excellent qualities;
and hence, the reply of Euripides to the Syracusans is a good one4;
and, of our old acquaint­ ances, those who know no ill of us.
And men are sensible of shame not only about the things them­ selves which have been mentioned as delicate points, but even about the indications of them ;
for instance, not only about licentious conduct, but also about all indications of it;
not only in doing what is disgrace­ ful, but even in mentioning it5.
And in the same way they are sensible of shame, not only before those who have been mentioned, but before those also who will be likely to disclose their conduct to them, as for instance, their servants or their friends.
In brief, however, people are not at all sensible of shame be­ fore those whose opinions, in regard to their justness, they hold cheap;
for no one feels shame before chil­ dren and brutes:
nor do men feel it about the same points when before acquaintances, as before strangers ;
but when before acquaintances they feel it on points really shameful6 ;
but before strangers on matters merely sanctioned by custom.
As regards themselves, men would be likely to be sensible of shame under these dispositions;
first, if there should really exist any so affected towards them­ selves, as I described those to be, in regard to whom they feel shame.
And these were either those whom they hold in admiration, or by whom themselves are held in admiration, or by whom they are desirous of being admired, or of whom they are petitioning some­ thing which they will not be likely to set, if not men of character.
And if these be either actual spectators Oust as, on the question of the allotment of Samos to colonists, Cydias introduced in his harangue to the ecclesia;
for he put it to the Athenians to imagine that the Greeks were standing round as actual specta­ tors, and not as mere future hearers, of the decree which they might pass);
or should persons of this description be near, or be likely soon to be aware of their conduct:
and on this account persons in misfor­ tune, do not wish even to be seen by those who once deemed them happy;
for they who thus deem of us are admirers.
And when they have attached to them what throws discredit on the conduct and the actions, either of themselves, or of their ancestors, or any others with whom in any way they are closely con­ nected ;
and, in one word, all in whose behalf they are sensible of shame ;
and these are the above-men­ tioned, and those who stand in any relation to them, whose tutors or advisers they have been 7.
And if there be others, their equals, with whom they are at rivalry;
for, from a feeling of shame, on account of persons of this description, men both do and leave undone very many things.
Again, when people are likely to be seen, and openly to be engaged before those who are privy [to their disgrace], they become in a higher degree susceptible of shame.
And hence the poet Antiphon, just as he was going to be beaten on the rack by Dionysius, observing those who were about to be executed with him muffling themselves up as they went through the gate, said, "Why do you muffle yourselves up;
—is it lest any of these pre­ sent should see you to-morrow ?
"Thus much then on the subject of the sense of shame;
but of insensibility to it, we shall evidently know enough from the contraries.
THE persons towards whom men feel gratitude, and the occasions on which, and with what dispositions on their own part, will be plain to us, after we have defined gratuitous benevolence.
Now, let gratuitous benevolence 1 be " that conformably to which, he who has the power is said to confer a benefit on one who needs it, not in return for any thing, nor in order that any thing may accrue to him who so confers it, but that some benefit may arise to the object."
But it becomes great should it be conferred on one who is in extreme want2, or if the boon be great and difficult of attainment, or at a crisis of a certain description, or if the giver has bestowed it alone, or first, or in a greater degree than any other.
Wants are however our desires of these;
such particularly as are attend­ ed by pain on failing of their objects;
and of this description are our lusts, as for instance, love.
Again, such as arise in the suffering of the body, and in dan­ ger ;
for both the man who is exposed to danger, and who suffers pain, is anxious for something.
On which account, those who stand by us in poverty and ban­ ishment, should they confer even trifling benefits, will yet have gratified us by reason of the greatness of our need, and the circumstances of the time ;
take the instance of him who gave but a mat [to a beggar] in the Lycæum.
It is necessary, then, that our obli­ gation have reference, if possible, by all means to some case of this sort, but if not, to some one of equal or greater need.
So that, as it is evident both when, and in what cases, an act of free benevolence takes place, and how the parties are affected, it is plain that out of these principles we must get up our speech, showing that, as regards the one party, they were or are exposed to pain, or want of this description, and as regards the other, that in such their want they as­ sisted them by administering some boon of this de­ scription.
And it is also evident, by recurring to what topics we may do away the obligation, and make our audi- ence insensible of grateful feelings 3;
for either we may urge that they are or were assisting them tor their own sakes, and this was supposed not to be free benevolence;
or are doing so just because it fell out by chance, or because they were compelled to do so;
or that they paid back a debt, but did not bestow a gift, and this as well if the party was conscious of his having been so indebted, as if he was not;
be­ cause there is in both cases the idea of a quid pro quo;
so that neither on this view of the case will any gratitude be felt.
We should also examine the point under all the predicaments;
for free benevo­ lence stands in this, either that that particular thing was given, or in such quantity, or of such a quality, or as to the time when, or the place where, it was given.
And we may adduce it as a sign to suit this purpose, if the parties in question have refused a less favour;
and if they have conferred on an enemy either the same favour, or an equal one, or a greater;
for then it will be evident that they did it not for our sakes.
Or, if he wittingly has given something paltry 4 ;
for no one acknowledges that he stands in need of what is paltry.
And now have my sentiments respecting benevo­ lence, and the want of it, been explained.
LET us explain the circumstances which excite pity ;
and the persons whom men pity;
and, as regards themselves, with what dispositions.
Now let pity be defined to be1, it a sort of pain occasioned by an evil capable of hurting or destroying 2, appearing to be­ fall one who does not deserve it, which one may himself expect to endure 3, or that some one connect­ ed with him will;
and this when it appears near:
for it evidently is necessary that a person likely to feel pity should be actually such as to deem that, either in his own person, or of some one connected with him, he may suffer some evil, and that an evil of such a description as has been stated in the defini­ tion, or one similar to it, or nearly equivalent to it4.
On which account neither do those who are abso- lutely lost, feel pity;
for these think they shall no longer be exposed to suffering, for their sufferings are past;
nor those who esteem themselves excessively happy, but these wax insolent;
for evidently, if they esteem every good to be realized to them, they also esteem their lot to be incapable of suffering any evil;
since this also enters into the number of goods.
But of this description, viz.
such as think they may yet suffer evil, are both who already have suffered and escaped5;
and those advanced in years, as well by reason of their prudence, as of their experience:
and the weak;
and those who are rather timid;
and men of education, for these calculate life's contingen­ cies aright;
and those to whom belong parentS , or children, or wives, for these attach to one's self, and are liable to suffer the above-mentioned evils.
Those do not feel pity who are under the excitements of courage, for instance, under anger or confidence;
for these feelings little calculate the future :
nor do those feel pity who are under insolent dispositions 7;
for these persons also calculate little of suffering any thing:
but those who are of the mean temperament between these are susceptible of pity :
and those again are not susceptible of it who are vehemently affected by fear;
for such as are horror-struck do not feel pity8, by reason of its being akin to an evil which comes home to themselves......
Also people are suscep- tible of pity, should they esteem some persons to be good;
for he who esteems no one to be such9, will think every one deserving of evil.
And in a word, every one, when he is so affected as to call to his recollection the fact, that evils of such a character have befallen either him or his, or to apprehend that they may befall either him or his.
And now it has been stated with what dispositions men feel pity.
The circumstances which excite their pity will be evident from the definition :
for whatever things, of the number of those which cause pain and anguish, have a tendency to destroy, are all such as to cause pity:
again, every thing whose tendency is utter abolition;
also all those evils which involve the quality of greatness, and of which chance is the cause .
But the evils whose characteristic is great anguish and destruction, are as follows:
death, as­ saults, personal injuries, and age, and sickness, and want of food.
And the evils of which chance is the cause, are, absolute want, or fewness of friends, (on which account even the being torn from friends and familiars is a circumstance to be pitied,) ugliness, in­ firmity, deformity, and the circumstance that some evil befalls one from a source whence it were becom­ ing for some good to have arisen;
and the frequent occurrence of a similar thing:
and the accession of some good, when one has already passed his suffer­ ings ;
as for example, the gifts of the king were sent down to Diopithes after he was dead11;
and the fact either that no good has accrued, or of there being no enjoyment of it when it has arrived.
These, then, and the like, are the circumstances on account of which men feel pity.
But people are sensible of pity toward their ac­ quaintances, if they be not of extremely close con­ nexion, but about such they feel just as they do about themselves when on the eve of suffering:
and on this account Amasis, as they say, did not shed a tear over his son when he was being led to execution, but he did over his friend who was asking an alms ;
for this was a circumstance to call for pity;
the other, to excite horror, For horror is distinct from pity, and has a tendency to expel pity from the breast, and is frequently available to produce a contrary ef­ fect 13.
Still men feel pity while the evil is yet ap­ proaching.
And they feel it towards their equals, whether in age, in temper, in habits, in rank, or in family;
for in all these relations, the evil is seen with greater clearness as possible to befall also one's self.
For we must here also assume generally, that what­ ever people fear in their own case, that they pity as happening in the case of others.
But as the disasters which excite pity always appear to be close at hand, while, as to those removed at the distance of ten thousand years, men neither in the expectation of them, if future, nor in the remembrance of them, if past, are sensible of pity at all, or at least not in an equal degree;
this being the case, it must follow that those characters which are got up with the aid of gesture, and voice, and dress, and of acting, generally have the greater effect in producing pity 14.
For thus, by setting the evil before our eyes, as either being on the eve of taking place, or as having hap­ pened, men make it appear to be close at hand.
Likewise things which have just taken place, or quickly about to do so, have on this very account a greater tendency to excite pity.
Also the indications and actions of persons ;
for instance, the garments 15 of those who have suffered, and other things of that sort.
And the expressions of those under suffering, for instance, of those already in act of dying.
And especially is it a circumstance to move pity, that while in these crises the persons have borne themselves virtuously 16.
For all these circumstances produce pity in a higher degree from its appearing near;
also, the fact of the person's being unworthy, and his dis­ aster appearing in view before our eyes.
To pity is opposed, most directly, that feeling which men call indignation;
for, to the feeling pain at un­ deserved misfortune, is opposed in a certain way the feeling pain at undeserved good fortune, and it ori­ ginates in the same disposition;
and these feelings are both those of a virtuous disposition.
For we ought to sympathize with, and to pity those who are undeservedly unfortunate;
and to feel indignant at those who are undeservedly fortunate;
for whatever happens contrary to desert is unjust;
and on this account we make indignation an attribute even of the gods1.
It should seem, too, that envy stands opposed to pity in the same way, as appearing to be akin to, and in fact the same thing as, indignation;
and yet it really is distinct.
For envy is also a pain causing agitation, it also is felt at good fortune, not, however, at the good fortune of the undeserving [only], but of equals and fellows2.
The feeling, however, in all cases equally [of envy and of indig­ nation], must exist [in the breasts of those affected by it], not because any difference will be likely to accrue to themselves, but on account of their neigh­ hour, solely as regards himself.
For no longer will the one feeling be envy, and the other indignation, but fear, should the pain and agitation exist on this account, viz.
because some evil will probably result to themselves from the good fortune of the other.
But it is plain that opposite feelings will be conse- quent on these passions:
for he who feels pain at those who are undeservedly unfortunate, will feel pleasure, or at least be unaffected by pain, at those who are unfortunate under different circumstances3:
for instance, no good man would feel pain about par­ ricides and murderers when they meet with punish­ ment ;
since we ought to feel joy at such occurrences ;
and so in the case of those who are deservedly for­ tunate ;
for both are instances of justice, and cause the good man to rejoice, since it must be that he has a hope that what has been realized to his equal, will be realized also to himself, and these are all feelings of the same disposition;
and their opposites, of the opposite dispositions.
Since the same man who ex­ ults in misfortune4 is also envious;
for any who feels pain at the accession and acquisition of any good, that person necessarily must rejoice when that good is in act of being withdrawn and lost.
On which account these feelings are all of them obstacles to pity;
but, among themselves, they differ for the fore­ going reasons, so that all are alike available with a view to render a thing not an object of pity.
On the subject of indignation, then, let us first state who the persons are with whom men feel in­ dignant, the occasions on which, and, as regards themselves, with what dispositions;
then, after these, of other points.
But the subject will be plain from what has already been said ;
for if indignation be a feeling pain on a man's appearing to be undeservedly fortunate, it will be evident in the first place that it is not possible to feel indignation in the case of every good.
For there is no one who, if another be just, or brave, or shall make acquisitions of virtue, will feel indignation at that other ;
for neither is pity felt at the contraries of these qualities5:
but it is about wealth and power and the like possessions [that people feel indignant], and in a word, about all those things of which the good are deserving, and such as are naturally possessed of advantages;
as, for ex­ ample, of high birth, of beauty, and advantages of that description.
But as what is ancient seems, in a certain sense, akin to what is natural, it must follow, that men are indignant, in a greater degree, at those who possess the very same good, if they be recently possessed of it, and are by its means in good circum­ stances, [than with those who have long possessed it.]
For those who have recently become rich give greater pain than those who have long been rich, and by right of birth.
And, in the same way, persons in office, and men of power, and possessed of numer­ ous friends, and of good children, and any good of this description ;
and likewise if, through the instru­ mentality of these, there should accrue to them any further good:
here, too, those of recent wealth, who by means of their wealth get into office, give greater pain than those who have been wealthy of old.
And in a similar manner in the case of the others.
But the reason of this is, that while the one sort appear to possess what is their own, the others do not;
for that which appears ever to have held this rank, seems to involve an idea of truth ;
insomuch that the others seem to possess what does not belong to them.
And as, of the goods, each does not become any one who may accidentally present himself, but there is a certain proportion and idea of adaptation;
for ex­ ample, splendour in respect of armour, is not adapted to a man whose virtue is justice, but to him who possesses courage ;
and splendid marriage feasts are not adapted to those of recent wealth, but to those of high birth:
therefore if any one, though he may be a good man, meet with a possession which is not adapted to him, we should feel indignant;
as also with an inferior who disputes with his superior;
and particularly if he does so on the very points in which he is inferior.
Whence also this was remarked by Homer:
" He missed engaging with Ajax the son of Telamon ;
for Jupiter was indignant because he was fain to engage a hero his superior6."
But, if it be not on the same grounds, we feel indignant if an in­ ferior challenge a superior, even on any grounds;
for instance, if a musician were to dispute with a just man, for justice is superior to music.
The per­ sons then with whom, and the reasons why men feel indignant will be evident from this;
for they are these or others of the same description.
As regards themselves, men have a tendency to in­ dignation, if they deserve and have acquired the highest goods;
for the circumstance of those not their equals being thought worthy of equal advan- tages, is not just.
Next, they feel it, if they chance to be good and excellent persons;
for they both judge aright, and hate what is unjust.
Again, if they be ambitious and desirous of certain objects, and especially should they be ambitious about those things which others who are undeserving obtain.
And those, in a word, who think themselves worthy those things, of which they do not esteem others worthy, are apt to feel indignant at those others, and about those very objects.
On which account slaves, sorry fellows, and men devoid of ambition, are not liable to feelings of indignation, since there is nothing of which they think themselves worthy.
And from this it is evident on what occasions of misfortunes, or ill luck, or failure of success, persons ought to rejoice, or at least to be unaffected by pain;
for, from what has been stated, the contraries will be evident.
So that should the speech have wrought up the judges into this disposition, and should it have shown that those who claim to be pitied, and that the circum­ stances under which they claim it, are undeserving pity, and really deserving not to gain it, it will be impossible for the judges to feel pity.
IT is plain also on what occasions, with whom, and with what dispositions men feel envy, if in truth envy be " a sort of pain at apparent good fortune, touching the above-mentioned goods in the case of equals, not in order that any thing may happen to one's self, and simply on account of their [being thus fortunately for those who have, or seem to have equals, will be the people to be envious.
I mean by equals, those who are like in circumstances of birth, connexions, age, habits, character, and property.
They, too, will be envious who fall but little short of possessing all2:
hence those who are carrying on mighty projects, and those who are prosperous, are envious;
for they think that every one is carrying off what belongs to them.
Again, those who are re­ markably esteemed on any account, and particularly on account of their wisdom or happiness.
And those who are ambitious are more given to envy than those who are devoid of ambition.
And those who make a show of wisdom, for they are ambitious on the score of wisdom.
And, in a word, those who in any respect are ambitious of glory are given to envy in that respect.
And the narrow-minded;
for, to them, every thing appears of consequence.
The goods respecting which men feel envy have been told you ;
for all those things whatsoever, about which men are eager for praise, and ambitious, whe- ther they be productions or acquisitions, and re­ specting which they are desirous of renown, and all cases of good luck;
about all these nearly is envy felt;
and particularly about such of them as the in­ dividuals are themselves desirous of, or think they ought themselves to possess, or those things in the possession of which they are themselves superior, or deficient in a trifling degree.
Again, it is evident with whom men are envious ;
for this has been already stated in connexion [with what has gone before;
since men envy those who come near them in time, and place, and age, and cha­ racter ;
whence the saying, " kindred too is conscious of envy3.
Men also envy those with whom they are at rivalry;
for they are rivals of those above- mentioned ;
but of those who existed ten thousand years back, or who may live ten thousand years hence, or who are already dead, of these no one is the rival;
nor again of those who live at the Pillars of Hercules4;
nor of those of whom, in the opinions either of themselves or of others, they are greatly the inferiors ;
nor again of those to whom they conceive themselves to be in a great degree superior;
with the like indifference do they regard those [at all en- gaged] in pursuits of this description.
And as men are affected by ambition in regard to rivals, and competitors, and all, in a word, who are eager after the same objects, it must follow that they envy these in an especial manner;
whence the saying, " potter envies potter."
And those who either succeed with difficulty, or do not succeed at all, envy those who succeed quickly.
Again, they envy those whose ac­ quisitions and success are a reproach to themselves, and these are those who are near them, or their equals;
for it becomes evident that they do them­ selves fail of success through their own fault, so that this, galling them, produces envy.
And those who either possess or have acquired that which it would become themselves to possess, or which themselves had at one time acquired;
at least the old, on this account, envy the young.
And those who have been at considerable expense on an object, envy those who have expended little on the same object.
But it is evident both with whom, and on what occasions, and with what dispositions people of this sort feel plea­ sure ;
for they will be delighted, having in the con­ trary circumstances that very temper, the which being without, they are pained.
So that if the judges themselves shall have been wrought up into this disposition, while those who lay claim to our pity or to the acquisition of some good, are such as have been described, it is evident that they will not obtain pity at the hands of those on whom they de­ pend for it.
HENCE likewise it will be evident both with what dispositions, and in regard to what objects, and of whom, persons are emulous.
Because if emulation be it a sort of pain at the apparent presence of goods which are held in honour, and which admit of one's gaining them himself, in the case of those naturally our equals;
felt, not because they are present to an­ other, but because they are not likewise present to one's self," (on which very account emulation is a vir- tuous feeling, and belongs to virtuous people, whereas envy is a depraved feeling, and belongs to persons who are depraved:
for the one, by motion of his emu- lation, sets himself to acquire the good;
while the other, by motion of his envy, sets himself to cause the dispossession of his neighbour).
It must be, then, that persons who deem themselves worthy of goods which they do not possess, are apt to feel emulation;
since no one arrogates to himself that which appears impossible:
and hence the young and the high-spirit­ ed are thus affected;
and also those to whom belong goods of such a description as to be worth the atten­ tion of men in repute;
these are wealth, number of friends, office, and whatever other goods are of this kind ;
for men feel emulous of such goods;
as though, because they properly belong to such as are men of virtuous dispositions, it were matter of absolute right that themselves should be virtuous.
Again, those are emulous whom others esteem worthy of such goods:
and those again whose ancestors, or relations, or in­ timate friends, or whose tribe or city is held in es­ teem about any point, such persons are apt to feel emulation on that point;
for they think they belong properly to them, and that themselves are worthy of them.
But if those goods are matter of emulation which are held in esteem, it must of course follow that the virtues are of this description ;
and whatever things have a tendency to aid and benefit others;
since peo­ ple honour virtuous people, and those who benefit them:
likewise that all goods whatsoever, the enjoy­ ment of which accrues to one's neighbours, are of this sort;
for instance, wealth, and beauty, rather than health.
And it will also be evident who the persons are who are objects of emulation;
since they who possess these, and the like goods, become objects of emulation ;
these goods are such as have been mentioned, for ex­ ample, courage, wisdom, sovereignty;
for those who are sovereigns have a power of benefiting many.
Generals, orators, all, in fact, who have abilities this way [are objects of emulation.
And those whom many wish to resemble, or who have many acquaint­ ances, or many friends.
Or those whom many admire, or whom they do themselves admire.
And those on whom are pronounced the praises and encomia of poets and panegyrists2.
Persons, however, of a con- trary description, men despise;
for contempt is the contrary of emulation ;
and the despising of the being emulous.
And it must be that persons so affected as to emulate certain persons, or to be themselves ob­ jects of emulation, are apt to feel contempt for those things and persons who possess evils the contraries of those goods which are the objects of emulation.
On which account men frequently despise the fortun­ ate, when their good fortune is unconnected with those goods which are held in esteem.
Of the means, then, by which the passions are ex­ cited in the breast, and are allayed, one of the sources 3 out of which means of persuasion arise, of these we now have treated.
LET us next go over in detail the dispositions2 of men ;
considering of what kind of a turn they are, in reference to their passions, habits, ages, and fortunes.
I call anger, lust, and the like, by the name pas­ sions;
a subject of which we have treated above.
By the name habits, I designate virtues and vices :
and of these we have treated above, both as to the points on which men form deliberate choice, and that to which they give birth in action.
And the ages are youth, prime, and old age.
By fortune I mean, high birth, and wealth, and abilities, and their opposites;
and, in one word, good and bad fortune.
Now the young are in their dispositions prone to desire, and of a character to effect what they desire.
And they are in the highest degree apt to pursue the pleasures of love above all desires about which the body is concerned, and in these they are incontinent.
But they are prone to change, and fastidious in the objects of their desires.
And they desire with earn- estness, but speedily cease to desire;
for their wishes are keen.
without beinsr durable:
lust like the hunger and thirst of the sick.
And they are passionate and irritable, and of a temperament to follow the impulse.
And they cannot overcome their anger;
for by reason of their ambition they do not endure a slight, but become indignant, and fancy themselves injured:
and they are ambitious indeed of honour, but more so of victory;
for youth is desirous of superiority, and vic­ tory is a sort of superiority.
And of both these are they desirous in a higher degree than of gain;
but least of all are they desirous of gain 3, by reason of their having never yet experienced want;
just ac­ cording to the proverbial saying of Pittacus to Am- phiaraus4.
And they do not view things in a bad light, but in a good, by reason of their never having yet been witnesses of much depravity.
And they are credulous, from their never having yet been much imposed on.
And they are sanguine in their expectations ;
for like those who are affected by wine, so the young are warmed by their nature;
and at the same time from their having never vet met with many repulses.
Their life, too, for the most part, is one of hope;
for hope is of that which is yet to be, while memory is of that which is passed:
but to the young that which is yet to be, is long;
but that which has passed, is short;
for in the early days of life they think they remember nothing, while they hope for every thing;
and they are easily imposed on, for the reason which has been stated;
because they soon cherish expectation.
And they are brave rather to an excess;
tor they are irritable and san­ guine, qualities, the one whereof cancels fear, and the other inspires courage;
for while no one who is affected by anger ever is afraid, the being in hope of some good is a thing to give courage.
And they are bashful;
tor they do not as yet conceive the honour­ able to be any thing distinct, but they have been educated only under the established usage of the state.
And they are high-minded;
for they have not as yet been humbled by the course of life, but are unexperienced in peremptory circumstances:
again, high-mindedness is the deeming one's self worthy of much;
and this belongs to persons of sanguine ex­ pectations.
And they prefer succeeding in an hon- curable sense than in points of expediency;
tor they live more in conformity to moral feeling than to mere calculations5;
and calculation is of the expedient, moral excellence, however, of that which is honour­ able.
Again, they are fond of friends and companions rather than ot their other compeers in age, by reason of their delighting in social intercourse, and of their not yet deciding on any thing in reference to what is expedient;
so that they do not decide on their friends [ upon that principle.
And all their errors are on the side of excess and too great earnestness, in con­ travention of Chilo's rule;
for the young carry every thing to an excess;
for their friendships are in ex­ cess, their hatreds are in excess, and they do every thing else with the same degree of earnestness ;
they think also that they know every thing, and firmly asseverate that they do;
for this is the cause of their pushing every thing to an excess.
And, in their trespasses, they trespass on the side of wantonness, and not of malice.
They are likewise prone to pity, from their conceiving every one to be good, and more worthy than in fact he is6;
for they measure others by the standard of their own guiltlessness ;
so that they conceive them to be suffering what they do not deserve.
And they are fond of mirth, on which account they are also of a facetious turn7;
for face­ tiousness is chastened forwardness of manner.
Such, then, is the disposition of the young.
BUT those who are advanced in life, and who have passed their prime, are of dispositions in most points the very opposite of these.
Since by reason of their having lived many years, and having been deceived in a greater number of instances, and having mis­ taken, by reason, too, that the majority of human affairs are but worthless, they neither positively as- severate any thing, and they err in every thing more on the side of defect than they ought.
And they always "suppose," but never "know" certainly;
and, questioning every thing, they always subjoin a "perhaps," or a "possibly."
And they talk of every thing in this undecisive tone, asserting nothing de­ cisively.
And they are apt to view things in an unfavourable light;
for a disposition thus to view things, is the judging of every thing on the worse side.
Moreover they are apt to be suspicious from distrust, and they are distrustful from their expe­ rience.
And on this account they neither love nor hate with great earnestness;
but, conformably to the remark of Bias, they both love as though about to hate, and hate as though about to love.
And they are pusillanimous, from their having been humbled by the course of life;
for they raise their desires to nothing great or vast, but to things only which con­ duce to support of life.
And they are illiberal;
for property is one of the necessaries;
and they are at the same time aware, from their experience, of the difficulty of its acquisition, and of the ease with which it is lost.
And they are timid and apprehen- sive of every thing ;
tor their disposition is the reverse of that of the young;
for they have been chilled by years, but the young are warm in their temperament;
so that their age has paved the way to timidity;
for fear is a certain kind of chill.
And they are attached to lite, and particularly at its last closing day, from the circumstance that desire is of some object which is absent, and that men more espe­ dally desire that of which they stand in need.
And they have sell-love more than is fitting ;
or this too is a kind of littleness of spirit.
And they live in a greater degree than they ought by the standard of expediency, and not of what is honourable, by reason of their self-love:
for what is expedient is good rela­ tively, to one's self;
but what is honourable is good absolutely.
And they are insensible to shame, rather than liable to be affected by it;
for on account of their not holding equally in esteem the honourable and the expedient, they despise appearances.
Again, they are not easily inspired with hope, on account of their experience;
for the majority of things are but paltry;
wherefore the generality turn out inferior to the expectation;
and once more on account of their timidity [they are apt to despond].
And they live more in memory than in hope;
for the remnant of life is brief, but what has passed is considerable ;
and hope indeed is of what is to come;
whereas memory is of things gone by:
the very reason this, of their garrulity;
for they never cease talking of that which has taken place, since they are delighted in awaken- ing the recollections of things.
And their anger is keen, but faint.
And their desires have, some, aban­ doned them, the others are faint;
so that neither are they liable to the influence of desire, nor apt to act in conformity to it, but with a view to gain;
on which account men of this age appear to be naturally temperate, for both their desires have relaxed, and they are enslaved to gain.
And they live more by calculation1 than by moral feeling;
for calculation is of expediency, but moral feeling is of virtue.
And, in.
their trespasses, they trespass on the side of ma­ lice, not of wanton insolence.
The old have more­ over a tendency to pity, but not on the same principle with the young;
for the latter are thus disposed from their love of human nature, the former from their imbecility;
since they consider the endurance of every calamity at hand to them, and this was laid down as a principle of pity2.
Whence they are que- rulous, and neither facetious, nor fond of mirth ;
for querulousness is the very reverse of fondness for mirth.
Such, then, are the dispositions of the young, and of those in advanced life3.
So that, as all welcome an address worded to their own disposition, and a speaker who resembles themselves, it is clear by em­ ploying his oration in what way the orator will ap­ pear of this description, as regards himself and what he says.
THOSE who are in their prime will, it is evident, be in a mean in point or disposition between these, sub­ tracting the excesses of each:
being neither rash in too great a degree, (for rashness is of this description, i. e. in excess,) nor too much given to fear, but keep- ing themselves right in respect to both.
Neither placing confidence in all, nor distrusting all, but judg­ ing rather in conformity to the truth.
Neither living with a view solely to what is honourable, nor with a view only to expediency, but with a respect to both.
And conformed neither to penurious parsimony, nor to extravagance, but to what is fitting.
With the same equality do they carry themselves also in respect to anger and to desire.
And they are of a tempering coolness joined with spirit, and are spirited not with­ out temperate coolness:
for in the young and in elderly persons these qualities are separated;
since the young are spirited, and of an intemperate rash­ ness, while elderly persons are of a chastened spirit, and timid.
And thus, in a word, whatever advan­ tages youth and age have divided between them, the middle age possesses both;
and in whatever respects they are either in excess or defect, in all these it holds a mean and what is fitting.
But the body is in its prime from the age of thirty to five and thirty;
and the mind about the age of forty-nine.
Let thus much, then, have been said re­ specting youth, and old and mature age, and the dis­ positions which they severally are of.
BUT let us treat of the goods of fortune next in order, so many of them at least as influence the dispositions of men in any particular way.
Now it is the disposition of high birth, that its pos­ sessor is more ambitious than others;
for all, when any possession is realized to them, are wont to ac- cumulate upon it.
But high birth is nobility of an­ cestry ;
and it is apt to indulge in contempt even of those who are as good as its own ancestors ;
because distinctions, in proportion as they are more remote, rather than recent, are held in greater esteem, and afford a ready plea for arrogance.
But, noble, is an appellation referring to excellence of birth;
whereas, generous refers to one's not de­ generating from the nature [of his ancestry] ;
which, generally speaking, is not the case with the noble, but the majority of them are ordinary persons.
For there is a kind of richness of produce in the genera- tions of man, just as there is in that which arises from the land;
and at times, should the stock be good, there arise in a family at intervals extraordinary per­ sons ;
and afterwards it again relaxes.
And a fami­ ly of brilliant talent run wild into dispositions bor­ dering on madness 1;
as in the instances of the descendants of Alcibiades, and Dionysius the elder:
and one of sedate wisdom, into stupidity and dul­ ness;
as in the instances of the descendants of Ci­ mon, and Pericles, and Socrates.
ANY one, without any great penetration, may distin- guish the dispositions consequent on wealth;
for [its possessors] are insolent and overbearing, from being tainted in a certain way by the getting of their wealth.
For they are affected as though they possessed every good;
since wealth is a sort of standard of the worth of other things ;
whence every thing seems to be purchaseable by it.
And they are affectedly delicate and purse-proud;
they are thus delicate on account of their luxurious lives, and the display they make of their prosperity.
They are purse-proud, and violate the rules of good breeding2, from the circumstance that every one is wont to dwell upon that which is beloved and admired by him, and because they think that others are emulous of that, of which they are themselves.
But at the same time they are thus affected reasonably enough;
for many are they who need the aid of men of pro­ perty.
Whence, too, that remark of Simonides addressed to the wife of Hiero respecting the wealthy and the wise;
for when she asked him, " whether it were better to have been born wealthy or wise," he replied, " wealthy;
for," he said, " he used to see the wise hanging on at the doors of the wealthy."
And [it is a characteristic of the rich] that they esteem themselves worthy of being in office;
for they consider themselves possessed of that on ac­ count of which they are entitled to be in office.
And, in a word, the disposition of the rich is that of a fool amid prosperity.
However, the dispositions of those who are but lately rich, and of those who have been so from of old, are different;
inasmuch as those who have re­ cently become rich have all these faults in a greater and a worse degree ;
for the having recently become rich is as it were an inexpertness in wealth.
And they are guilty of offences, not of a malicious nature, but such as are either offences of contumely or in­ temperance;
for instance, in the case of assault or adultery.
AND in the same way on the subject of power, the most striking almost of its dispositions are evident;
for of these power has some in common with wealth, and others which are better.
For men in power are more ambitious and more manly in their dispositions than the wealthy;
from their aiming at all duties, whatsoever, which from their power they have the means of discharging.
And they are less given to trifling, because, from a necessity of looking carefully to their power, they are constrained to a diligent at- tention.
And they comport themselves with a dig- nity which is conciliatory rather than repulsive;
for their claims for dignity render them more conspicuous;
on which account, they bear themselves moderately :
but conciliatory dignity is a softened and graceful sedateness.
And, if they do transgress the bounds of right, it is not in small points, but in those which are of importance, that they are guilty.
But good fortune, according to its constituents, is of the disposition of the states which have been de­ scribed ;
since those which appear to be the greatest instances of good fortune resolve themselves ulti­ mately into these states:
and, besides these, to the excellence of one's progeny, and to personal advan­ taged.
But men are usually more overbearing and inconsiderate in consequence of prosperity.
But one disposition, and that most excellent, is a concomitant of good fortune, viz.
that the fortunate are lovers of the gods, and are disposed toward the deity with a sort of confidence, in consequence of the goods winch have accrued to them from fortune.
The subject, then, of the dispositions as they con­ form to age and to fortune has been discussed;
for from the opposites of my remarks the opposite sub­ jects will be evident;
the subject, for example, of the disposition of a poor, or unfortunate person, or of one out of power.
BUT since the use of persuasive orations has a refer­ ence to the forming a decision (since on questions which we are acquainted with, and have decided on, there is no further need of an oration) ;
and as this is their use, whether addressing his speech to a single iudividual, the speaker endeavours to exhort or dis­ suade (which they do who admonish or persuade;
since that individual is in no less degree a judge;
because the person [be he who he may], whomsoever we want to persuade is, once for all, a judge);
and also if one be speaking against an adversary, or on any supposed question, it has equally [a reference to decision] ;
(for one needs must employ a speech, and sweep away objections against which, as against an adversary, he directs his address);
this is just as much the case in demonstrative oratory (since the speech commends itself to the listener just as though to a judge).
But he alone is strictly a judge, who decides on the questions at issue in civil1 controversies:
since both forensic questions, and those on which men de­ liberate, are agitated as to how they stand.
But of dispositions, as they are affected by the constitutions of states, we have spoken above.
So that the means will now have been distinctly unfolded, both how, and by the use of what things, we may render our addresses ethical.
But as there was, in each species of orations, a cer­ tain distinct end proposed;
and as respecting all of them some ideas and propositions have been ascer­ tained, out of which the deliberative, demonstrative, and judicial orators deduce their means of persuading;
and as, in addition to these, the means by which it is possible for us to render our speeches ethical, have been developed;
it merely remains, that we go over in detail the topics which are common to the three species of oratory2:
for it is necessary that every orator should connect with his speech the topics of possibility or impossibility;
and for some it will be necessary to attempt to show that certain things will take place, and for others that they have taken place.
And again, the topic of greatness is common to all oratory ;
for every orator, whether he exhort or dis­ suade, praise or blame, accuse or defend, avails him­ self of amplification and diminution.
Let us also, after these points have been explained, attempt to treat of enthymems in general (if we are in possession of any thing on the subject) and of ex­ amples;
in order that by subjoining what remains we may make good our original proposal.
But of these common topics, amplification is most congenial to demonstrative oratory, as has been re­ marked ;
possibility, as relating to the past, to ju­ dicial3;
since on what has been its decision is made ;
but possibility, as relating to the future, is most con­ genial to deliberative.
FIRST, then, let us speak of things possible and those which are impossible.
If then it be possible that one contrary should ex­ ist, or be called into existence, the other contrary will also appear to be possible;
for instance, if it be possible for a man to be convalescent, it also is possible for him to be sick;
for the effective power of contraries, inasmuch as they are contraries, is the same.
If, of two similar things, the one be possible, the other which is similar will be possible also.
If the more difficult be possible, so will also that which is easier.
And if it be possible for a thing to be pro­ duced in a state of excellence or beauty, it also is possible for it to be produced under general circum­ stances ;
for it is more difficult for a building to be made beautiful, than simply a building.
And in whatever case the commencement is possible, the fulfilment also is possible 1:
for of things which are impossible, none either take place or begin to do so;
for instance, it neither is the case, that the diameter of a square is commensurable with the side, neither will it ever begin to be so.
Also, wherever the ful­ filment is possible, so is the commencement;
since every thing proceeds from a beginning.
And it the subsequent in being or production be possible, so also is the antecedent:
if, for example, it be possible that a man should be produced, so also is it that a child should, since it is antecedent in its production:
again, if it be possible for a child, so is it also for a man to be produced;
on the principle that the former is a commencement.
Things likewise are possible, of which there is a natural love or desire;
for no one loves what is impossible, neither desires it, for the most part at least.
Also, any thing which is the subject of an art or science, is possible both to exist and to be produced.
Likewise any thing whatso­ ever, the principle of whose production resides in those whom we can compel or persuade ;
such are those whose superiors, or lords, or friends we are.
And wherever the parts are possible, so also is the whole.
Wherever again the whole is possible, so also are the parts, generally speaking :
for if the latchet, the forepart, and the upperleather of the shoe admit of being brought into being, so also do the shoes themselves:
and if the shoes, then also the latchet, the forepart, and upperleather2;
also, if the genus be of the number of things possible, so also will be the species;
and if the species, so also the genus:
for example, if a vessel can be produced, so can a trireme;
and if a trireme, so can a vessel.
And if, of things which have a natural relation to each other, the one be possible, so is also the other;
as if the double be possible, so also is the half;
and if the half, so also is the double.
And if a thing admits of being brought into being without art or preparation, a fortiori it will admit of it by the help of art and attention.
On which principle too it has been re­ marked by Agathd, " Yes, truly, in some things you must fare just as fortune goes ;
other things there are which attach to us by necessity and art."
Also, if any thing be possible to persons who are worse, or our inferiors, or less prudent, much more will it also be possible to their opposites ;
just as Isocrates said, that " it would be strange if Euthynus learnt it, and he were not able to find it out.
"With regard, however, to things impossible, it is plain that they result from the contraries of the above-mentioned principles.
Questions as to the actual occurrence of any thing, are to be viewed under the following considerations.
For, in the first place, if that which had a less natural tendency to occur, has occurred ;
then may that have occurred which had a greater tendency.
And if that which is wont to take place subsequently, has taken place, that also has taken place which usually does primarily:
if, for instance, a man has forgotten, then also must he at some time have learnt that [ of which he is now forgetful].
Also, if a man was able and willing, he achieved the deed;
for all men when, being willing, they have power, proceed to act;
for there is nothing in their way.
If, moreover, a man was willing and had no external impediment.
If, again, the act was possible, and he was under the influence of an­ ger3.
And if it was possible, and he [the person in question] was influenced by lust;
for, generally speak­ ing, men, if they have the power, execute that of which they are desirous;
the bad from weakness of principle ;
and the virtuous because they desire ob- jects compatible with virtue.
Also, if a man was on the point of bringing the thing into action and of doing it;
since the probability is, that he who was on the eve of acting, did moreover really act.
Also, if all those things have taken place which naturally oc­ cur, either as preparatory to, or on account of the oc­ currence in question ;
as for instance, if it has light­ ened, it has also thundered;
and if he attempted it, he has also achieved it.
And if all those things which naturally occur subsequently, and that on ac­ count of which the deed is done, have taken place, then has also the prior to them and that which is the cause taken place:
if, for instance, it has thundered, it has also lightened;
and if he acted, he also attempt­ ed.
Of all this number there are some thus subse­ quent of necessity;
others however merely generally.
With regard, however, to the non-occurrence of things, the considerations applicable will be plain from the contraries of those above stated.
Also with regard to what will happen, matters will become evident from the same considerations;
for that which is within the power and the wishes of any one will take place.
Also things which are subjects of lust, anger, and reasonings, accompanied by power .
On this account, too, if persons be on the onset or on the eve of doing any thing, it will be done:
for, ge­ nerally speaking, things which are on the point of taking place occur, rather than those which are not.
Also, if all those things have preceded which natur­ ally occur before;
for instance, if it lowers, there is a probability that it will rain.
Also, if that has hap­ pened which is on account of the thing in question, it is probable that that will also happen;
for instance, if there be a foundation, it is probable that there will also be a house.
The subject of greatness and smallness in regard to affairs, also of the degrees of greater and less, and of things great and small in general, is clear to us from what has been said.
For, in the discussion of deliber­ ative oratory, the doctrine of the greatness of goods has been stated, and respecting the greater and less in the abstract.
So that as with respect to each class of speeches the proposed end is a good;
(for instance, the expedient,-the honourable,-and the just;
) it is evident that by every orator, his means of amplifica­ tion are to be arrived at through the medium of these.
But to institute, besides this, a further inquiry into the subject of greatness and of excess in the abstract, is to talk idly;
since particular cases are more com­ pletely applicable to use than mere generalities.
On the subject, then, of what is possible and im­ possible,-and whether the fact has or has not oc­ curred,—will or will not occur, and moreover on the subject of greatness and smallness in regard to affairs, let thus much have been said.
IT remains that I treat of the means of effecting persuasion which are common to every class of sub­ jects, since I have already treated of such as are peculiar.
And these common means of persuasion are two in species, example and enthymem:
for the sentiment is part of an enthymem.
Let us then first treat of example;
for the example is correspondent to induction ;
and induction is a principle.
But of examples there are two species;
for one species of example is the quoting real matters of fact which have actually taken place;
another is the fabri­ cating them yourself:
and of this method, one species is illustration, the other fable;
like those of Æsop and the African legends.
Again 1, example is some­ what of this description, as if one were to assert that the state ought to set itself in order against the king, and not to allow him to make himself master of Egypt;
and this, because aforetime Darius passed not into Greece, before that he had seized that country;
but when he had seized it, he passed across;
so that the present king, should he seize Egypt, will pass over;
on which account he is not to be permitted.
Illustration is of the nature of Socrates's dis­ courses :
for instance, were one to say that it is not fitting that magistrates chosen by lot should be in office;
for it is just the same thing as though one were to pick out wrestlers by lot;
not taking such as are able to contend, but those on whom the lot may fall:
or as though men were to draw lots for that person of the crew whom it might befit to take the helm;
as if it became the person on whom the lot fell, and not him who understood the art.
But fable is such as that of Stesichorus in opposi­ tion to Phalaris, and that of Æsop in behalf of the demagogue.
For Stesichorus, when the citizens of Himera had chosen Phalaris2 general with absolute powers, and were on the eve of assigning him a body guard, after other things which he said, related to them a fable:
" That a horse was sole master of a meadow;
but that on a stag's coming in and spoiling the pasture, in his wish to be avenged of the stag, he asked some man whether he should be able, in conjunction with him, to chastise the stag.
The man said [that he would be able] if he would take the bit, and himself were to mount him with his darts.
When, however, he had agreed to this, and the man was mounted, the horse, instead of being revenged, was himself already-the slave of the man.
And in the same way do you also (says he) look to it, lest, in your wish to avenge yourselves on your enemies, you suffer in the same way as the horse ;
for already, through your choice of a commander with independ­ ent power, you have the bit in your mouths:
but if you assign him a body guard, and permit him to mount into the saddle, you will become, from that moment forth, the slaves of Phalaris.
"And Æsop, when pleading at Samoa in behalf of a demagogue who was tried for his life, said, " That a fox in crossing a river was thrust out of her course into a drain, and that, being unable to get out, she was harassed for a long time, many horse leeches having got hold of her;
but a hedgehog wandering by, when he saw her, taking compassion on her, asked whether he should pick off the horse leeches from her;
that the fox however would not permit him;
but on his asking why, she replied, ' Because these are indeed already filled from me, and now suck but a little blood;
if, however, you should pick them off, others, who are hungry, coming up will drain off the little blood which remains.
But (said he), Oh Samians, thus also does this man no longer injure you ;
for he is wealthy:
should you, however, put him to death, others who are poor will come, who will exhaust you while they filch the public money.
"But fables are adapted to deliberative oratory, and possess this advantage;
that to hit upon facts which have occurred in point is difficult;
but with regard to fables it is comparatively easy.
For an orator ought to construct them just as he does his illustra­ tions, if he be able to discover the point of similitude, a thing which will be easy if he be of a philosophical turn of mind3.
Cases, then, in the shape of fables, are the easier to bring forward;
but those are more availing with a view to deliberation, which are put upon the ground of facts;
because, generally speak­ ing, the future resembles the past.
It will, moreover, be right for one who has not enthymems to employ his examples like positive proofs ;
since the persuasive efficacy of your speech will be produced by them:
but one who possesses [enthymems] should employ them like evidence, put­ ting them forward after his enthymems, in way of a conclusion.
Because, if they be put first, they bear resemblance to induction;
and induction, except in few instances, is not proper to rhetoric;
whereas when put in at the end, they resemble evidence;
and a witness in every case influences belief.
On which account, there is moreover a necessity imposed on him who puts them first of citing many;
for him, however, who states them in conclusion even one is sufficient;
for a credible witness, though but single, is serviceable.
The number, then, of the species of examples, how many they are, and how and when they are to be used, has been stated.
ON the subject of the use of maxims, after it has been stated what a maxim is, it will most easily be­ come clear both in what cases, on what occasions, and what persons it befits to avail themselves of the enunciation of maxims in their speeches.
Now the maxim is an assertion, and yet not re- specting particulars, as what kind of person Iphi­ crates was, but on some general subject;
neither is it on every general subject 1, as, that what is straight is opposed to what is curved;
but it is respecting as many subjects as moral conduct is concerned about, and as are objects of choice or avoidance in acting.
So that, as the enthymem is a form of reasoning nearly [confined] to this description of subjects, both the conclusions of enthymems and their premises, after the syllogistic form has been done away, be­ come maxims2.
Take an instance:
"A man who is in his sound mind never ought to educate his chil­ dren so as to be too highly skilled3."
Now this is a maxim:
but if the reason, and the cause why he should not do so, be added, the whole [conjointly] will become an enthymem;
thus, ————— " for besides the indolence which they contract, they will attach to themselves the bitter jealousy of the citizens."
Again, this :
"
There is not a man who in every respect is happy 4:
" and the following:
"There is not one of all mankind who is free5," are maxims:
and the last becomes an enthymem, if added to the following proposition, " for either he is the slave of money or of fortune.
"If, then, the maxim be what it has been described, there will necessarily be four kinds of maxims:
for either they will be with the annexed reason, or with­ out it.
Now the maxims which need proof are all such as assert any thing which contravenes received opinion, or is doubtful;
but those which state nothing contrary to people's notions do well enough] with- out the addition of proof.
And of these last it can­ not but be that some will need no proofs, from their having been previously known ;
as, " The best thing for a man, as it seems to me at least, is health "—be­ cause to nine-tenths of mankind this seems to be the case:
and that others simultaneously with their being uttered become evident to such as turn their attention to them ;
as, " There is no lover who does not always love."
And again, of those which have proof sub­ joined, some are a part of an enthymem, just as, " A man who is in his sound mind never ought," etc.
Others are essentially enthymems, and not part of an enthymem ;
the which obtain more than any other species.
And these are all those in which the reason for what is asserted appears wrought in, as in this maxim:
" Being yourself a mortal, do not cherish immortal wrath :
"—for the assertion that, " one ought not always to cherish wrath," is a maxim;
that, however, which is added, viz.
"because you are a mortal," states the reason why.
Similar to which is the following:
" It is fitting that a mortal conceive mortal notions, not that a being destined to death should think of what is immortal 7.
"From what has been said it has then become evi- dent, as well how many the species of maxims are, as also to what kind of subjects they are severally adapted.
For on subjects which may be questioned, or contravene received opinions, the orator must not use those without the reason annexed;
but let him either, prefixing the reason, use the conclusion as a maxim, thus—"
For my part, as then it neither is good to be exposed to envy, nor to be indolent, I assert that it is not good to be educated or, stating this [which here is the conclusion] first, subjoin that which was prefixed8.
Observing that on subjects which do not contravene received opinions, but are doubtful, that he annex the reason why as concisely as possible.
And on subjects such as these the apophthegms of the Lacedæmonians are very suit­ able, and sayings which have an air of mystery;
as if one were to apply that which Stesichorus said be­ fore the Locrians, " that they ought not to be inso­ lent, lest their cigalas should sing upon the ground9."
The employment of maxims becomes him who is rather advanced in life;
and particularly as respects subjects about which each happens to be well inform­ ed 10.
Since for one not so advanced in age to sport maxims is bad taste, just as it is for him to have re­ course to fables:
and the use of them on subjects about which one is ignorant is silly, and argues a want of education.
There is a sufficient sign of the truth of this;
for the boors of the country are of all other people most fond of hammering:
out maxims.
and set them forth with great volubility.
Also the stating generally a maxim which is, in fact, not ge­ neral, is most especially befitting in appeals to the feelings, and in the act of exciting indignation ;
and then either at the beginning, or after the proof.
Again, it is proper to avail one's self of maxims which are current and common, if they be of any service ;
for from their being common they appear to be correct, as though every one acknowledged their truth11:
this one, for instance, (if the orator be ex­ horting persons to face the hazard, though they have not sacrificed,) "
One omen there is which is best, to defend one's country ;
"—or to face it, though they be few in number,—" Mars is common;
" and to cut off the children of their foes, what though they have done no injury,—" He is a fool who, after slaying the father, still spares the child 12.
"Some old sayings too are maxims;
for example, the expression, "Next neighbour to an Athenian."
It is also proper to quote maxims which even contra­ vene the current sayings, (I mean by current sayings such as this, " Know thyself or this, " Too much of one thing is good for nothing;
") whenever your moral character may be likely to show itself to greater advantage, or the thing spoken is said in an impas- sioned manner.
The speaking in an impassioned manner is, as if one in a passion were to assert, " that it was a falsehood that one ought to know himself;
at least, this man, had he known himself, would never have claimed to be your general13."
The moral cha­ racter appears better [when we contradict a maxim] thus, "it does not become men, as some assert, to love as though they were about to hate, but to hate as though they were about to love."
And we ought to give a manifestation of our moral principle by means of the diction we employ, otherwise to subjoin the reason;
for instance, either stating the sentence thus, "we ought to love, not as they tell us, but as though always about to love, for the other is the part of an insidious manor thus, " the common maxim does not please me;
for it is the duty of the true friend at least to love as though he were always about to love." " Nor again [does this please me], that we ought to carry nothing to excess;
since 'tis our duty to hate the wicked at least to the very extreme.
"
They contribute, too, a considerable aid to our orations :
first owing to the vanity of the audience ;
for they feel a pleasure if one, speaking generally, happens to hit upon ideas which they hold on any particular point.
My meaning, however, will be plain in this way, as also the manner in which we ought to catch at them;
for the maxim, as has been stated, is an assertion universally, and men feel de­ lighted when that is asserted universally, which they happen previously to have taken up as their opinion upon particulars.
If, for instance, a man chanced to have bad neighbours or children, he would hail the man who should say, " nothing is more annoying than dwelling near people," or, " nothing is more silly than to beget children."
I
So that we should form a guess, some how or other, as to the opinions which our audience happen to have taken up with;
then to speak on these subjects ge- nerally conformably to them.
This one advantage the application of maxims must needs possess, and another superior to it;
for it gives our orations an air of character.
But those orations bear an im­ press of character in which the principle is manifest.
And all maxims produce this effect by reason of the speaker's asserting universally on things which are the objects of deliberate choice:
so that should the maxims be good, they make the speaker also to ap­ pear a man of worthy character.
Such, then, be our discussion on the subject of the maxim, of its nature, its species, the manner in which it is to be employed, and the advantages which it possesses.
LET us speak generally of enthymems, in what way we ought to seek for them, and afterwards of the topics, (τόποι,) for the nature of the two is respect­ ively different1.
It has been stated before, that the enthymem is a kind of syllogism, also in what way it is a syllogism, and in what respect it differs from the syllogism of logic;
for we should make our conclusions without taking up our assumptions either many stages back, or all of them together:
the one process from its length is obscure ;
the other, from its stating what is plain, is waste of words.
And this is the reason why men of no education have more persuasive influence over the mob than men of high acquirements, as the poet says, "that the unlearned speak more in unison with the feelings of the mob for the latter address them in common and general points, the former, from the store of their information, in a manner which comes home to them.
So that we are not to found our address on any thing which may seem to the purpose, but on certain defi­ nite points;
such, for example, as seem right to the judges, or those whose opinions they acknowledge;
and the reason for this is, that it will appear to be the case either to all or most of them :
moreover we should draw our conclusions not only from necessary, but also from contingent premises3.
First, then, you ought to be aware that it is neces­ sary, respecting every subject on which you have to speak and to draw conclusions, whether it be through the medium of the rhetorical syllogism4, or of any other whatsoever, to be masters either of all or some of the facts inherent in it:
for having none of them, you will not be able to draw your inferences from any thing5.
My meaning is this:
how shall we be able to give advice to the Athenians, whether they ought to go to war, without being informed what their forces are, whether naval or military, or both;
and these in how great numbers;
also what are their resources;
or their allies and enemies;
and yet further, what former wars they have waged, and in what manner, and other points of this description:
or how to eulo- gize them, unless we be informed of the sea-fight at Salamis, or the battle at Marathon, or the exploits achieved by them in behalf of the Heraclidæ, or some other such points;
for it is on the real or apparent honourable traits attaching to each object that all orators found their panegyrics.
And in the same way it is on their opposites that they ground their reprehension, always looking out for any thing of that nature which either attaches, or appears to attach, to the subject;
suppose [the case of a censure passed on the Athenians] because they subjected the Greeks to themselves, and reduced to a state of servitude the people of Ægina and Potidæa, who were their allies against the barbarian, and bore off the prize of high­ est worthy and every other transaction of this nature, and whatever other such error may attach to them.
And in the same way those orators who accuse and defend, construct their accusations and defences on a view of existing circumstances 7:
there is no differ­ ence in your pursuing this process, whether it be re­ specting Athenians or Lacedaemonians, men or gods.
For in advising Achilles, or in praising or blaming him, in accusing and defending him, we must assume the traits which attach, or appear to attach, to his character;
in order that from among their number we may, in so praising or blaming him, allege what­ ever things honourable or base attach to him;
and in accusing or defending him, whatever things just or unjust;
and in advising him, whatever is beneficial or injurious.
And in a similar manner respecting any business whatsoever;
as, respecting justice, the question whether it be expedient [must be discussed] on the ground of what appertains to justice or ex- pediency.
So that as all men appear thus to con­ struct their proofs, whether they draw their inferences with greater accuracy or remissness, (for they do not make their assumptions out of every subject, but from those circumstances which are inherent in each question,) and by reason that it is manifestly im­ possible otherwise to prove;
it is evident, then, that it is necessary, as I said in the Topics, to be in pos- session of certain select propositions on points which may occur, and are most convenient:
and [it is evident that the orator should conduct his inquiry respecting questions which arise on the sudden in the same manner, not turning his view aside to indefinite points, but to the actual points of the case which the oration is concerning;
and embracing in his sketch the greatest number he is able, and those coming the nearest to the point;
for in proportion as he is master of the greater number of the things inherent in the case, by so much the easier will it be to effect proof;
and in proportion as these are the nearer to the point, in the very same proportion will they be more peculiar, and less vague.
By vague I mean, the praising Achilles because ne is a man, ana one 01 tne aeinea heroes, and made war against Troy;
for these are points attaching to a thousand others beside:
so that such an orator no more praises Achilles than he does Diomed.
But by peculiar I mean, those which be­ fall no one else than to Achilles, for instance, the slaying Hector, the bravest of the Trojans ;
and Cycnus, who, being himself invulnerable, prevented all the forces from landing;
and that he joined the expedition the youngest, and without being bound by an oath;
and whatever other topics are of this de­ scription.
One element of enthymems, then, is that of selection;
and this is the first which partakes of the nature of topics.
And now let us state the elements of enthymems;
(but by pace and element of an enthymem I mean the same thing).
First, however, let us treat of those points concerning which it is necessary first to speak.
For of enthymems there are two species;
the one species are confirmative, that such is or is not the fact;
and the other refutative:
and they differ just as, in logic, the syllogism and the elenchus differ.
And the confirmative enthymem is the deducing a conclusion from acknowledged premises;
the retuta- tive, however, is the deducing an inference which is not admitted.
Now the general arguments nearly on each class of subjects necessary and useful to be known are in our possession;
for propositions have been selected on each [branch of rhetoric] ;
so that the topics out of which one must allege his enthy­ mems, whether on questions of good or evil, just or unjust, honourable or dishonourable, select points moreover respecting the dispositions, the passions, and the habits, having been collected above, are like­ wise actually before us.
But let us, in a different manner, further make as­ sumptions respecting all the classes of rhetoric, and putting a mark on them severally as we proceed, state both the refutative and confirmative elements, as well as those of apparent enthymems, which, how­ ever, are not really enthymems, for neither in truth are they [the elements of actual] syllogisms.
When these points have been elucidated, we shall discuss the subject of starting objections to enthymems, and the means of their solution, from what sources we ought to adduce them.
THERE is one element of confirmative enthymems, derivable from contraries;
for we should consider, whether the contrary quality be inherent in the con­ trary subject;
doing away the argument [grounded thereon] if it be not inherent;
and if it be inherent, founding one thereon ourselves:
for example, the ar­ gument that "
Temperance is good, because intem­ perance is injurious:
" or, as it is in the Messeniac 1 oration, " If war be the cause of our present trou- bles, of course we shall put ourselves right again with the return of peace."
And, " If in truth it be not just to be angry with those who unwillingly do us harm;
neither, if one on compulsion shall do good to any one, is it his duty to be grateful to him."
And, " If to speak falsely is among men available to persuade;
there is no anomaly in supposing, on the contrary, that many things which are true fail of being believed.
"Another is derivable from conjugate inflections2;
for the qualities must either be inherent consistently, or not at all;
for example, the argument, that " the just is not in every case a good, for then also would that which is justly be well;
now it is not, however, desirable to die justly3.
Another from relatives;
for if to one party attach the idea of his having acted honourably or justly, to the other also will attach that of having suffered [honourably, etc.].
Also, if to command be just, so also is the having executed [the command] ;
for ex­ ample, just as that farmer of the revenue, Diomedon4, said of the revenues, " If it be not base for you to put them up for sale, neither is it for us to purchase them."
And if the idea that he has suffered justly or honourably be on the side of the patient, so will it also be on that of the agent;
and if on that of the agent, then also on that of the patient.
There is, however, in this way of arguing, room for passing off some false reasoning 5:
for if the person has justly Buffered any thing, he indeed has justly been a suf­ ferer, but perhaps not so at your hands.
On which account we should view the question separately,­ whether the patient deserve to suffer, and whether the agent have a right to inflict the suffering;
that done, to employ the facts in whatever way may suit our purpose:
for at times, considerations of this kind do not harmonize;
just as in the Alcmæon of Theodectus, " Did no man hate thy mother ? "
In his reply he tells her, that it is fitting to consider the points taken separately ;
and when Alphesibœa asks how, taking her up, he says, " That she indeed de­ served death, they did decree;
but at the same time that I ought not to be the slayer."
And just so the trial respecting Demosthenes, and of the persons who slew Nicanor.
For when they had been adjudged to have slain him justly, it appeared that he had also been justly put to death.
Again, respecting the per­ son who met his death at Thebes, respecting whom some one bade the question be decided, whether he were deserving death ;
as though it were not unjust to slay one who deserved to die.
Another element is derivable from the relations of greater and less 6;
for instance :
"
If not even the gods know every thing, hardly I should suppose do men ;
" for it is to say, that if the quality be not inherent in that which would more naturally possess it;
then it is evident, that in that which would less naturally possess it, it is not inherent.
And the argument, that " he assaults his neigh­ bours, who even does so to his father is derived from the element, if the less probability exist, so also does the greater ;
[which is available] in reference to whether of the two points it may be needful to prove, whether that it is or is not the fact.
And again, by parity of reasoning, when it is said, " And is thy father to be pitied in that he has lost his children, and is not in truth CEneus who has lost his noble offspring ? " and the argument, " If indeed The­ seus committed no wrong, neither did Paris;
" and, " If Tyndarus' sons did not act unjustly, neither did Paris and this, " Suppose Hector did slay Patro- ClUB, Paris slew Achilles;
" and this, " If other artists are not to be held cheap, neither are philosophers ;
" and, " If generals are not held cheap because they are frequently vanquished, neither are sophists;
" and that, " If it behoves an individual to have a care for your glory, it also behoves you to regard that of Greece.
"Another element arises from the consideration of time, as Iphicrates urged in his oration against Har­ modius, " that if before my doing it, I had claimed to have the honour of a statue, ye would have granted it;
will ye not then grant it me now that I have achieved it ?
—Do not, therefore, engage yourselves under promises, when about to receive;
and, when you have experienced the benefit, withdraw them."
And, on another occasion, in reference to the The­ bans permitting Philip to pass through into Attica, the argument that, " if, before his aiding them against the Phocians, he had claimed a passage, they would have promised;
it were then an absurd thing, if, be­ cause he threw himself on them, and had confidence in them, they should not let him march through8.
"Another element is deduced from assertions made respecting yourself retorted upon your adversary;
and the term is of exceeding service, as is exemplified in the Teucer;
one too it is of which Iphicrates availed himself against Aristophon, when he put the question home to him, whether he would betray the fleet for a bribe;
and on his denying that he would, then said he, " Would you, who are Aristophon, not betray them, and shall I, who am Iphicrates ?"
You ought, however, to be dealing with an opposite party, who appears in a greater degree to have been guilty of injustice;
otherwise it would appear ridiculous, were any one laying an accusation against an Aris­ tides, to allege this ;
but it ought always to tend di­ rectly to the discredit of him who lays the impeach­ ment ;
for, generally speaking, the plaintiff presumes himself better than the defendant;
this notion, then, it behoves us to refute.
And generally it is absurd when one chides in another what he does himself, or would feel inclined to do ;
or exhorts him to do what he does not himself, neither would be induced to do.
Another place is from definitions9;
as, " that the genius is nothing else than either the deity, or his production.
And yet whoever conceives the exist­ ence of the production of a deity, must necessarily think at the same time that gods are in existence10.”
And, as Iphicrates said, "that that man was most noble who was the best;
for that there did not at­ tach any nobility to Harmodius and Aristogiton be­ fore they had achieved some noble exploit."
And his proof that himself was more nearly akin to them, by saying, " At any rate my deeds are more akin to those of Harmodius and Aristogiton, than yours are11.”
And, as was said in that speech about Paris, " All will be free to acknowledge that the intemperate do not acquiesce in the enjoyment of a single person."
And the reason on account of which Socrates refused to go to Archelaus, “ because," said he, " it is a dis­ grace for one who has been treated well to be unable to make a retort on terms of equality, just as it would be for one who has been treated ill.”
For all these deduce their inferences about the points respecting which they speak, after having defined and ascer­ tained the question.
Another element is deducible from the number of senses in which a word may be taken, as in the Topics respecting the acceptations of the word rightly.
An­ other from taking the different bearings of the case;
as, " If all act unjustly for three objects, for the sake either of this, or this, or this, and from two of these motives it is impossible that he should have acted;
but that he acted on the third, not even the accusers themselves allege.
"Another from induction, as may be illustrated from the oration respecting Peparethus, to establish that women every where discern truly respecting their children;
because first at Athens the mother made the matter clear to Mantias, the orator, when under­ taking a suit against his son;
and again at Thebes, when Ismenias and Stilbon were at issue on the point, the Dodonian woman proved the child to be the son of Ismenias;
and on this account they considered Thessaliscus to be the son of Ismenias.
And again, from the law of Theodectes, " If people do not give their own horses in charge to those who manage those of others amiss, nor [their ships] to those who over­ turn the ships of others;
neither ought we, if in every case it happens in the same way, to employ those who but ill protect the safety of others, for our own protection."
And, as Alcidamas asserted, that " all pay honour to the wise, at least the Parians honoured Archilochus, what though he was a calum­ niator of them ;
and the Chians, Homer, who was not their citizen ;
the Mitylenaeans, Sappho, though she was a woman;
and the Lacedæmonians, who of all people are the least attached to learning, made Chilon one of their senators;
the Greeks of Italy also honoured Pythagoras, and the people of Lam­ psacus buried Anaxagoras, though a foreigner, and honour him even to this day;
the Athenians again were prosperous while they abode by the laws of Solon, and the Lacedæmonians, while by those of Lycurgus ;
also at Thebes, at the time that the magistrates were men of learning, the state enjoyed prosperity.
"Another element of enthymems is derivable trom a former decision of the same, a similar, or opposite question ;
more especially indeed if all men so decide, and that uniformly;
and otherwise, [if not all,] but the majority;
or the wise, either all, or most of them;
or the good;
or if the very judges themselves, or those whom they approve, or those in opposition to whom they cannot decide (as for instance those on whom they depend);
or those contrary to whom it is not becoming to decide;
for instance, a god, or a fa­ ther, or teacher, [happen so to have decided].
Just on the principle of the appeal of Autocles to Mixide­ mides, " whether it beseemed the awful goddesses to render an account to the Areopagus, and not Mixi­ demides ?"
Or, as Sappho insisted, “that to die was an evil, the gods having so decided;
since [had it not been so] they would themselves have died;
" or as Aristippus told Plato when he asserted something, as he thought, rather dogmatically, " Yet," said he, " our companion at least held no such thing," mean­ ing Socrates.
And Hegesippus, having first con­ sulted the oracle at Olympia, put the question second­ ly at Delphi,-whether he [Apollo] was of the same opinion as his father;
as though it were disgraceful to contradict a father.
And of Helen, as Isocrates wrote 12, that " she was worthy, since indeed Theseus judged her so."
And of Paris, " whom the goddesses preferred 13;
" and of Evagoras, as Isocrates says, that must needs be virtuous, “ since Conon, when un­ fortunately passing by every one else, came to Evagoras.
”Another element arises from an enumeration of parts;
as in the Topica, "what kind of motion the soul is;
it is either of this, or that description."
And an instance occurs in the Socrates of Theodectes:
"Toward what temple hath he been guilty of im­ piety ?
whom of the gods which the ritual of our state acknowledges, hath he not honoured ?
"Another consists in, Since, in the generality of in- stances, it happens that on the same circumstances somewhat is consequent whether good or evil, the exhortation or dissuasion by means of these conse­ quences, the accusation or defence, the praising or blaming;
for instance, on education is consequent envy, which is an evil;
and the being wise, which is a good:
[on the one hand then you may assert that] men should not seek to be educated, because it is not good to be envied;
[on the other that] it is fitting to be educated, for it is good to be wise.
In this topic14, with the addition of that on possibility, and the other [universal means of proof], as they have been stated, consists the system of Calippus.
Another occurs, when we want to exhort or dis- suade respecting two propositions, and those opposed to each other;
and to avail ourselves of the foremen­ tioned argument in the case of both.
The difference [between this and the element last mentioned] is, that in it the opposition is merely between any proposi­ tions which may happen, it here holds between con­ traries :
for instance, a priestess was endeavouring to prevent her son from becoming a public speaker ;
because, said she, " If on the one hand you speak what is just, men will hate you ;
if what is unjust, the gods.”
[Here then it might be retorted], there­ fore you ought to become a public speaker;
for, " if you speak what is just, the gods will love you;
if what is unjust, men 15."
And this is equivalent to the proverb " of buying dirt as well as salt."
And the retortion is this, when on each of two contraries good and evil is consequent, they being respectively opposed.
Another arises from the circumstance, that men do not approve the same things privately as before the world;
but when in public, they praise beyond all things what is just and honourable ;
but within themselves they prefer what is expedient:
the orator should endeavour to infer whichever suits his pur­ pose, for this element is of sovereign use in exposing anomalies of opinion.
Another element is deducible from the analogy of results ;
as Iphicrates urged when they compelled his son to serve who was under the standard age, be­ cause he was tall, that " if they esteem great children as men, they assuredly will vote small men to be children."
And Theodectes, in the oration respect­ ing the law, asked, "Do ye make the mercenaries, such as Strabax and Charidemus, citizens on account of their virtue, and will ye not make exiles of those among the mercenaries who have committed these intolerable acts ?
"Another arises out of the argument, that if the re­ sult be the same, the principle from which it arises will be the same;
just as Xenophanes used to argue, that " they are equally guilty of impiety who assert that the gods were produced, as those who assert that they die;
for in both cases it happens that in some period or other the gods do not exist."
And generally assuming that the result of each act is in every case identified with it.
[Take this argument as an illus­ tration] :
“
Ye are about to pronounce, not respect­ ing Socrates, but respecting the pursuit in general, whether it be right to addict one's self to philosophy."
And this, "that the giving earth and water is the being slaves."
And that the participating in the common peace is the performing of what is enjoined."
Now we are to take whichever side may suit our pur­ pose.
Another may be deduced from the circumstance, that the same persons do not choose the same things subsequently as before, but contrariwise;
as, for in­ stance, this appeal:
—“ If, when in banishment, we fought that we might return;
shall we, now that we have returned, take to flight, in order that we may not fight16?”
For one while they chose abiding in their country at the expense of fighting ;
at another, the possibility of avoiding fighting at the expense of non-continuance in their native land.
Another element which may be resorted to is, the assertion that a thing either exists or was produced, for the sake of that for which it might have existed or been produced;
as if some one were to give a person any thing, in order that by taking it from him he may annoy him.
Whence also it has been said, "
To many, fortune, not bearing them good will, gives great good luck;
but it is in order that they may re­ ceive the more conspicuous calamities 17."
And this from the Meleager of Antiphon :
"
Not in order that they might slay the beast, but that they may become witnesses, before Greece, of Meleager's valour."
And that insinuation in the Ajax of Theodectes, "that Diomede chose Ulysses, not as any compliment, but in order that his attendant might at the same time be his inferior."
For it is very possible that he did so on this account.
Another, common both to the judicial and de- liberative orators, is the consideration of the motives which stimulate or retard men, and the objects with a view to which they both act and avoid;
for these are such as, if they be actually in existence, we needs must proceed to action;
for instance, if the under­ taking be possible, and easy, and beneficial, either to the person in question himself, or to his friends, or pernicious to his enemies, and entailing loss on them;
or if the loss be less than the object proposed18.
And it is upon these considerations that orators ex­ hort, and on their opposites that they dissuade ;
more­ over they both defend and accuse upon the ground of these considerations;
they rest their defences on those which are used to dissuade, and their accusations on those used to exhort 19.
The whole system of Calippus, as well as that of Pamphilus, is nothing more than this element.
Another is deducible from circumstances which appear to have taken place, but which are improba­ ble, on the ground that they would not seem to be facts, had they not well nigh occurred or actually done so;
and that they have a yet stronger claim to belief;
for men apprehend as truths either facts or probabilities;
if then it be passing belief, and not probable, it will be true 20;
for at all events, it is not on account of its likelihood and plausibility that it has this appearance of being the case.
Just as An­ drocles of the burgh Pithos, said in his impeachment of the law, when the multitude were tumultuous as he spoke, " The laws require some law to set them right, for the very fishes require salt;
" and yet it is neither likely nor plausible that creatures bred in the brine of the sea should require salt.
“ Nay, the olive lees require oil," and yet it is a fact not to be credited, that the very things from which oil is produced should require oil.
"Another element, REFUTATlVE, is the consideration of contradictions;
if there occur any contradiction under all the circumstances of time, conduct21, say­ ings, and the like.
And this independently, respect­ ing your adversary, as "
He tells you that he loves you, yet did he conspire with the thirty [tyrants] ;
" or independently respecting yourself, " He tells you that I am litigious, but is not able to prove that I have brought any action into court;
" or respecting both yourself and the adversary distinctly, " This man never lent any thing, but I have ransomed many of you.
"Another, applicable to those who have been calum- mated, or who appear so, whether men or actions, is the explaining the cause of the mistaken notion;
for there is some circumstance, on account of which it appears to be the case;
for example, when a certain woman had come in contact with her son, she seemed from her embracing him to have had connexion with the youth;
when, however, the circumstance which caused it had been stated, the charge was quashed.
And as in the Ajax of Theodectes, Ulysses tells Ajax why, though he is braver than Ajax, he does not seem so.
Another is derived from the cause, if that be in existence, arguing that the effect is also;
and should it not exist, that neither does the effect.
For cause, and that of which it is the cause, exist conjointly, and nothing exists without a cause.
Just as Leoda­ mas in his defence, when Thrasybulus accused him, because he had been inscribed with infamy on a pil­ lar in the Acropolis, but erased it in the time of the thirty tyrants, urged, " that it was not possible, be­ cause the thirty tyrants would put greater confidence in him, while his hatred toward the democracy re­ mained inscribed in public.
"Another is, the observing whether the thing re­ specting which the party is deliberating, or acting, or has acted, did or does admit of being on another and better footing;
since it will become evident that, if this be the case, he has not acted;
since no one vo­ luntarily, and of his own knowledge, deliberately chooses what is bad.
This, however, involves a fal­ lacy ;
for in many cases it becomes clear [only] when too late, how it might have been managed better, whereas it was before unknown.
Another, which occurs when any thing anomalous to former acts is about to be done, is the considering the both in connexion;
just as Xenophanes advised the people of Elea, when they asked him whether they should sacrifice and sing a dirge to Leucothea22 or not, " if they conceived her to be a deity, not to sing a dirge;
but if a human being, not to sacrifice.
"Another element is, the accusing or defending on the ground of errors committed;
for instance, in the Medea of Carcinus, some persons accuse her because she slew her children, [alleging] that at all events they were not forthcoming;
for, respecting the send­ ing away her children, Medea was in fault:
she, however, defends herself [alleging that, if any one], she would have murdered Jason, not her children;
which in truth had she done, she would have erred in not doing the other.
And this element and spe­ cies of enthymem constitutes the whole of that system of Theodorus, which is first.
Another is deducible from the name;
as Sophocles says, " Steel in truth you are, and bear the name."
And as they are wont to say in their praises of the gods23;
and as Conon used to call Thrasybulus, “ rash in counsel," (Ɵρασύβουλος);
and Herodicus told Thrasymachus, " You are always rash in fight, (Ɵρασύμαχος) ;
and Polus, "You always are a colt," (Πω̃λος);
and Draco the legislator, that " his laws were not those of a man, but of a dragon 24;
for they were harsh."
And as the Hecuba of Euripides says of Venus, " The very name of the goddess rightly begins with folly25.”
And as Charemon says, "Pen­ theus, rightly named from the calamities26 awaiting him.
"Refutative enthymems, however, are more in re- pute than the confirmative;
by reason of the refutative enthymem being a setting contraries briefly together ;
and because things when put in contrast are more palpable to the auditor.
Of all forms of reasoning, however, as well confirmative as refutative, those produce the greatest effect27, which are of such a de­ scription that, on the commencement of their enun­ ciation, men anticipate the conclusion, yet without their being superficial;
for the hearers on their own parts, feel a pleasure 28, in having of themselves anti- cipated it;
and [next to these may we class] all those, by which the hearers are left behind, just so much as that they apprehend them simultaneously with their having been enunciated.
JUST as it is possible that [one form of reasoning] may be a syllogism, and that another, without really being such, may appear to be so ;
even so it must needs be with respect to the enthymem also, that one description should really be enthymems, and another not, however they may appear to be;
for the enthy­ mem is a species of syllogism.
But the elements of these apparent enthymems are, one derivable from the diction:
and of this, the first kind is, as in logic, the asserting your last proposition with all the air of a conclusion, although you have deduced no [legitimate] inference at all:
thus, " So and so is assuredly not the case, necessarily, therefore, so and so is."
And the expressing yourself in the course of your reasonings concisely and pointedly;
for this kind of style is the very province of the en­ thymem, and this kind of fallacy is, it is probable, that which is [demonstrated] " the result of the style of the diction ;
” but the stringing together the heads of many syllogisms, is a good expedient with a view to expressing yourself with all the air of syllogism in your style;
thus, " that he preserved some, avenged others, emancipated the Greek people."
For each of these propositions has been demonstrated from others ;
and when they are put in conjunction, it appears that something results ever from them.
Another kind arises from similarity of names, as the assertion, that “ the mouse is an excellent animal, being that from which the most esteemed of all rites have derived their name;
” for of all rites, the mysteries are held in most esteem.
Or, if any one in praising a dog, were to embrace in his panegyric the dog in the heavens, or Pan;
because Pindar thus addresses him, “ 0 blessed being, whom the inhabitants of Olympus call the all-various dog of the mighty goddess.”
Or the arguing, that "it is a most disgraceful thing, that there should be not even a dog in the house;
and therefore it is evident that a dog is honourable."
And the assertion, that Mercury is " communicative" above all the gods, because Mercury alone is called “common.”
And the stating that λóγος, speech, is most excellent;
because the good are worthy of λóγος, esteem, not of wealth:
for the words (λóγου ἄξιον) are not used in a single sense.
Another [element of fallacy] is the asserting con- jointly what is true separately;
or separately, what is true conjointly;
for as it appears to be the same thing, what though in many instances it be not the same, the orator should practise whatever method is more available to his purpose.
The saying of Eu­ thydemus is neither more nor less than an instance of this;
the declaration, for instance, that " he knew there was a galley in the Piræus1,” for he knew each [separate fact of his assertion].
And to declare of one who knows the constituent letters, " that he knows the verse 2;
" for the verse is the same thing.
Again, the saying that "as twice so much is prejudicial, he denied that the one was wholesome;
for it is absurd that two good things should constitute one that is noxious."
Thus enunciated, it is adapted to refuta­ tion;
but thus it is confirmative;
" for two evils do not constitute one good," etc.
But the whole topic is replete wih fallacy.
Such again is the saying of Polycrates respecting Thrasybulus, that he had de­ posed thirty tyrants3;
" for he takes them conjointly.
Or, as in the Orestes of Theodectes, from distinct cases, "It is just that she who has slain her husband should die;
as also that a son at least should avenge his father.
Now, are not these the very things that have been done ? " for, taking the cases conjointly, perhaps it is no longer just.
This may also come under the fallacy of omission, for it is not explained " by whom [she should be put to death].
"Another element is the doing away or establishing a point by exaggeration4:
and this occurs when, without having shown that [the prisoner] has really committed the crime, [the accuser] proceeds to ex­ aggerate it;
for this fallacy causes it to appear (when the accused employs the exaggeration) that he has not done the deed;
or, (supposing it be the accuser who gets into a passion,) that he has done it.
Thus then there is no enthymem ;
for the hearer is sophis­ tically brought over to a belief either that [the ac­ cused] has or has not done it, without any proof having been adduced.
Another is the argument drawn from a sign , for this also is illogical;
as if one were to say, "Lovers are an advantage to states;
for the love of Har­ modius and Aristogiton deposed the tyrant Hip­ parchus."
And if one were to say, “ Dionysius is a robber, for he is a wicked man;
" for this also is illogical, because not every wicked man is a thief, although every thief is a wicked man.
Another is the arguing from an accidental cir- cumstance;
exemplified in that which Polycrates6 said about mice, that “ they lent their aid by gnaw­ ing through the [enemy's] bowstrings."
Or sup­ posing one to declare, "that the being bidden to supper is the most honourable;
for Achilles was wroth, on account of his not being invited by the Greeks at Tenedos:
" he however was enraged, as though he was treated with disrespect, and this occurred upon his not being invited.
Another arises from establishing the consequent;
as in the oration respecting Paris, Lit is contended J that " he is of a noble spirit;
because, despising the society of many, he abode on Ida by himself for, because the noble-spirited are thus disposed, he, too, it should seem, is noble-spirited.
Again, “
Since he is both foppish in his dress, and strolls about by night, he is an adulterer;
" because adul­ terers are persons of such habits 7.
Similar to this is also the argument, that the poor, because they dance and sing in the temples ;
and that exiles, because it is permitted them to dwell where they list, [are happy.]"
For as these advantages belong to those who appear to be happy;
they too would appear to be happy, to whom they belong.
Moreover, the case varies with the circumstances of the transaction;
on which account, the argument falls under the charge of omission.
Another arises from stating as a cause that which in fact is not;
[arguing], for instance, on its having happened "simultaneously," or "after;
" for men do assume that what occurs subsequently,” [occurs] " by means of" [that which preceded], and more especially those engaged in state affairs;
just as Demades [insinuated] "that the administration of Demosthenes was the cause of all their misfortunes :
because a war happened after it.
"Another, from the omission of the “when” and “ manner how;
" for instance, the argument " that Paris carried off Helen justly;
because free choice had been given her by her father8;
” for very pos­ sibly it was not [granted] for a continuance, but at first merely;
because so far only was she at her father's disposal.
Or if any one were to say, " that the striking free men was an insult:
" because under all circumstances this is not the case, but when one begins the violence.
Again, as in the disputations of the Sophists, there arises an apparent syllogism from stating things ab­ solutely or not absolutely, but conditionally ;
as [it is contended] in logic, that " what is a nonentity, does exist;
because a nonentity exists as a nonentity ;
" and that " what is unknown is known, for it is known to be unknown9;
” just so in rhetoric also, we have an apparent enthymem from what is not absolutely probable, but conditionally probable.
This, however, is not universally the case;
as in truth Agatho re­ marks, " Perhaps some one will be inclined to assert this to be probable, that many improbabilities will befall men for that which is contrary to probability does occur ;
so that even what is contrary to proba­ bility is probable 10;
this, however, is not the.
case absolutely;
but just as in sophistical disputations, it is the omission of the circumstances of extent, rela­ tion, and place, which produces the imposition;
so also here [in rhetoric], it results from the things being probable not absolutely, but conditionally pro- bable.
The system of Corax is constructed upon this topic:
for supposing your client, without being open to the charge, as for instance, being infirm, should be under a charge for an assault, [you have grounds for your defence,] because the case is not probable:
and if he be open to the charge, from his being, for example, a powerful man, [still you may defend him] on the ground that it is not likely, be­ cause it was sure to seem to be likely11.
And so also respecting all other cases, for he needs must be either open to the imputation or not.
Both cases then ap­ pear to be likely;
but the one is likely [absolutely], the other not absolutely, but so as has been explained.
And this is [the secret] "of making the worse, the better side 12."
And hence mankind were justly in- dignant at the annunciation of Protagoras13;
for it is an imposition, and not the real, but an apparent pro­ bability, and has a place in no art except rhetoric, and the art of disputation.
And now the subject of enthymems, as well real as apparent, has been dis­ cussed.
IT follows that I speak of the modes of disengaging one's self from arguments.
1 hey are either the meet­ ing them with contradictory arguments, or starting an objection 1.
Now as to the meeting them with counter arguments, it is evident that we may do it on the ground of the same topics [as were given for refuta­ tion]:
for the arguments arise out of probabilities, and many things which appear likely are opposed to each other.
Objections, however, (as was stated in the Topics,) are started in four ways:
1. for either it may be from the same subject:
2. from a similar:
3. or an op­ posite [to that from which the adversary argues]:
4. or from points already decided.
By deriving your objection from the same source, I mean that, sup­ posing the enthymem were respecting love, " that it was a good feeling;
” there would be a twofold ob­ jection;
tor it [might be started] asserting generally that " every want is bad or particularly, that " the proverbial expression Caunian loves2, would not have arisen had there not been some wicked loves.
Again, an objection is alleged on the ground of a contrary fact;
as, if the enthymem was this, " The good man benefits all his friends [and the objection,] "But the bad man does not hurt all his.
And on the ground of similar cases3;
if the argument be, " Those who have been treated ill always hate;
” [the objec­ tion,] that " those who have been treated well do not always love4.”
And again, the decisions of men of celebrity:
thus, suppose one brought forward the ar­ gument, that "we ought to have some feeling for those who are intoxicated, because they err ignorant­ ly5:
” this objection [may be started], that "Pittacus is not therefore entitled to praise, otherwise he would not in his enactments have imposed higher fines, in case the party committed the error while intoxicated.
"But as all reasonings [of the orator] are derived from four sources, and these four are probability, ex­ ample, proof positive (τεκμήριον), and signs;
and as the reasonings drawn from what is usual, or appears to be so, are drawn from probabilities, while those drawn by inference from similarity of circumstances, whether in one or more instances, (when the speaker embracing what is general, then infers particulars,) exist by virtue of example;
while those again which are inferred from what is necessary and fact, are founded on proof positive;
and lastly, as those drawn from what does or does not hold good, whether uni­ versally or particularly, result from signs, [it being remembered] that probability is not what always, but what usually occurs;
it is plain that it is, in every case, possible to get rid of reasonings such as these by starting an objection, The solution is, how­ ever, [sometimes] apparent, and not always real;
for the objector does not do it away on the ground of its not being probable, but on that of its not being necessary 6.
Wherefore it always happens, that the defendant has the advantage of the accuser, by means of this piece of sophistry.
For as the accuser con­ structs his proof by means of probabilities (the task of getting rid of the positive certainty being by no means the same [in point of difficulty], as that of getting rid of the probability of the charge);
and as that which is merely probable, is invariably open to an objection ;
(for it otherwise would not be a pro­ bability, but invariable and necessary;
) and if this method of solution have been adopted, the judge supposes either that it does not amount to a proba­ bility, or at least that he ought not to decide, having been imposed upon in the way mentioned above;
because [in fact] he is not bound to pronounce on positive proofs alone, but also on probabilities, which is the spirit of the oath, " that he will decide to the best of his judgment;
" wherefore that will not be a satisfactory objection which rests merely on the ab­ sence of proof positive, but it is further incumbent on the objector to get rid of the probability;
this, however, will be the case, if the objection be proba- ble in a higher degree;
(and it may be so in two ways, either on the score of time, or of the nature of the case;
and pre-eminently so, if in both these particulars;
) for if in the majority of instances it be as you state, then it is a greater probability.
Signs also, and the reasonings deduced from them, may be got rid of, even if they be facts, as was stated in the first Book;
for it is clear to us from the Ana­ lytics that every sign is illogical.
The same method of solution applies to reasonings grounded on example as to those on probabilities;
for if we have a single instance in contravention, it has been answered7, [sufficiently to show] that it is not necessary;
or that in the majority of instances, and those of more frequent occurrence, the case is other­ wise.
If, however, it be the case more frequently, and in the majority of instances, we must contend that the present is not the case in point, or that its application is not in point, or that it has some differ­ ence at all events.
But proofs positive (τεκμήρια), and the reasonings grounded on them, we shall not be able to get rid of, at least not on the plea of inconclusiveness;
this is clear to us from the Analytics:
it remains for us to show that what is asserted is not the case 8;
if, how­ ever, it be clear both that it is true as a matter of fact, and that it is a proof positive of the point, from that moment it becomes irrefragable;
for thenceforth it is plain from demonstration.
AMPLIFICATION and extenuation are not elements of enthymems, (by topic and element I mean the same thing,) since the element and the topic is that under which many enthymems fall;
whereas amplification and extenuation are [themselves] enthymems for showing that a thing is great or little, like those for showing that it is good or bad, just or unjust, or falls under either of the other denominations.
And these are all the questions about which syllogisms and enthymegis are conversant;
so that unless each of these be a topic of an enthymem, amplification and extenuation are not.
Neither, again, are the topics which are available to solution of enthymems, at all different in species from those employed in their construction:
for it is evident that he effects solution who either proves [something contrary], or states an objection, and they establish a counter proof of the contrary ;
thus, " If one has argued that a fact has taken place, the other argues that it has not;
" or " if one argues that it has not, the other insists that it has."
So that this will not amount to a difference;
for both employ the same vehicles of proof, inasmuch as they each allege en­ thymems to show that it is, or is not the case.
But the objection is not an enthymem, but is, as was stated in the Topics, the stating some opinion from which it will appear that no legitimate inference has been arrived at, or that [ the opponent] has as­ sumed some false proposition.
Thus much, then, on the subject of examples, and maxims, and enthymems1, and, in a word, all the means of persuasion which address themselves to the understanding, both the sources whence we may furnish ourselves plentifully with them, and the means by which we may effect their solution 2.
It remains for us to go over the subject of style and ar­ rangement3.
As there are three points which ought to be handled respecting a speech;
one, as to the sources out of which will arise means of persuasion;
a second, re­ specting the style;
a third, how we ought to arrange the parts of a speech.
On the subject of the means of persuasion much has been said, as well as to how many the sources are out of which [they arise], name­ ly, that they are three;
also, what is the nature of these sources, and why they are no more:
for all those who decide, are persuaded either by being them­ selves impressed in a certain way, or from conceiving the speakers to be men of a certain character, or from the matter of fact having been proved 1.
It has been stated also with respect to enthymems, whence we are to furnish ourselves with them;
for [ of those sources], some are elementary propositions, peculiar [to the several branches of rhetoric] ;
others are places [of universal applicability].
It follows that we treat of the subject of style;
for the mere being in possession of what one ought to say is not enough;
but it is moreover necessary that we deliver it as we ought;
land the doing this] contributes much to your speech's appearing to be of a certain character.
Now that by which its nature is first, was, con- formably to nature, investigated the first;
viz.
whence these things derive their persuasive efficacy:
next to this, was the disposition of them in the speaking:
and thirdly, [arose an inquiry] of the greatest con- sequence, but which never yet has been handled, on the subject of delivery;
for it was introduced into tragedy and the public recitations at a late period, since at first2 the poets used themselves to sustain the dialogue3 in their tragedies.
It is therefore plain that some such power exists in relation to rhetoric, as well as to poetry;
which [as connected with the latter art]
Glauco the Teian, and some others, have treated of.
And it depends on the voice, as to how we ought to manage it in reference to each several passion ;
when, for instance, we should employ a loud, when a low, and when a moderate pitch of voice;
and on the manner in which we should employ its tones, viz.
the acute, the grave, and the intermediate;
and on certain rhythms in reference to each;
for the points, in reference to which they conduct their in­ quiries, are three, viz.
the loudness of the voice, the fitness of its tones, and its rhythm.
Now these pro­ ficients bear away nearly all the prizes in the disput­ ations ;
and as in the other contests4 the actors now produce a greater effect than the poets, so likewise do they in civil causes, owing to the depravity of states.
There is not yet however any system com­ piled respecting these points, (since even the subject of style was brought forward at a late period,) and, if rightly conceived of, it appears an ornament adapted to vulgar tastes5;
but as the whole subject of rhetoric has reference to opinion, we should pay attention to it, not as to a subject of absolute propriety, but as one of necessity;
for as to mere matterof justice,.
we ought not to inquire further on the subject of speeches than so as to avoid giving pain, at the same time that we do not delight;
for the rule of right is, that the contest be carried on by means of the facts themselves;
so that, except the proof, all the rest is superfluous 6;
but it is notwithstanding, as has been stated, a point of great moment, in consequence of the weak judgment of the auditor.
The subject of style, however, has some necessary though trifling claim on our attention in every system;
for the ex­ pressing one's self in this or that way makes some dif­ ference with a view to exhibiting the subject clearly, not however to so great a degree [as is generally sup­ posed] :
all these points are however mere idea, and have a reference to the auditor ;
wherefore it is that no one teaches geometry in such a style.
This art then, be it introduced when it may7, will produce the same effect as that of acting.
And some to a small extent have already made an effort to treat of it;
Thrasymachus, for instance, on the excitement of compassion.
Again, the being qualified for de- livery is a gift of nature, and rather without the province of art;
the subject of style, however, is clearly reducible to an art.
Wherefore rewards are bestowed in turn on those who are proficients in this, just as there are on those rhetoricians [ who claim] on the ground of delivery;
for written orations in­ fluence more by means of their style than through the sentiment.
Now the poets, as was natural, began to make a stir upon the subject at first;
for words are imita­ tions, and the voice, of all our parts, is the most imitative8;
on which account also these arts were constructed, both that of recitation, and of acting, and of others too.
But as the poets, though what they said was very frivolous, appeared to acquire their reputation by means of their style;
on this account the first style [of rhetoric] was formed on that of poetry, witness the style of Gorgias;
and even at the present time the majority of ignorant people fancy that such orators speak most delight- fully :
this however is not the case, but the style of poetry and that of prose is distinct, and the result shows it;
for not even the writers of tragedy them­ selves any longer employ the same turn of diction, but just as they have passed from trochaic to iambic metre9, because the latter is most like prose of all the other metres ;
so have they also relinquished all those terms which are foreign to the style of convers­ ation, with which however the early writers used to embellish [their works], and which even at the pre­ sent day are employed by those who write in heroic metre;
wherefore it is ridiculous to imitate the tragedians, who in their own case no longer employ that turn of diction.
So that it is evident that we need not discuss with minuteness all points soever which it is possible to treat of under the head of style, but so many only as belong to such an art as we are speaking of:
the other part of the subject has been spoken of in my treatise on Poetry.
LET this then have been discussed:
and let excel- lence of style be defined to consist in its being clear ;
(a sign of this is this, that the diction, unless it make the sentiment clear, will not effect its purpose1;
) and neither low, nor above the dignity of the subject, but in good taste ;
for the style of poetry indeed is not low, yet it is not becoming in prose.
Of nouns and verbS those which are in general use produce the effect of clearness:
to prevent its being low, and to give it ornament, there are other nouns which have been mentioned in the Poetics, for a de­ parture [from ordinary acceptations] causes it to ap­ pear more dignified ;
for men are affected in respect of style in the very same way as they are towards foreigners and citizens.
On which account you should give your phrase a foreign3 air ;
for men are admirers of things out of the way, and what is an ob- ject of admiration is pleasant4.
Now in the case of metrical compositions, there are many things which produce this effect, and there are very becoming, be­ cause both the subject and the person stand more apart [from ordinary life];
in prose, however, these helps are much fewer, for the subject is less exalted:
since even in that art were a slave, or a mere youth, or [any one, in fact, in speaking] of mere trifles to express himself in terms of studied ornament, it would be rather unbecoming ;
but here too [as in poetry] the rule of good taste is, that your style be lowered or raised according to the subject.
On which account we must escape observation in doing this, and not appear to speak in a studied manner, but naturally, for the one is of a tendency to persuade, the other is the very reverse5;
because people put themselves on their guard, as though against one who has a design upon them, just as they would against adulterated wine.
[Let your style then be such] as was the case with the voice of Theodorus as com­ pared with that of the other actors6;
for it appeared to be that of the character which was speaking, theirs however were foreign from the character.
And the deceit is neatly passed off if one frame his nomen­ clature upon a selection from ordinary conversation ;
the thing which Euripides7 does, and first gave the hint of.
As however nouns and verbs are [the materials] of which the speech is made up, and as nouns admit so many species as have been examined in the Poetics, out of the number of these we must employ but spar­ ingly, and in very few places, exotic8 and compound words, and those newly coined;
where they may be employed I will state hereafter9:
the reason [of the restriction] has been mentioned, viz.
because they re­ move your style [from that of common life] more than is consistent with good taste.
Words however of ordinary use, and in their original acceptations10, and metaphors, are alone available in the style of prose:
a proof [that this is the fact, is] that these are the only words which all persons employ;
for every body carries on conversation by means of metaphors, and words in their primary sense, and those of ordi­ nary use.
Thus it is plain that, if one should have constructed his style well, it will be both of a foreign character, and that [the art of the orator] may still elude observation, and [the style itself ] will have the advantage of clearness ;
this however was laid down to be the perfection of rhetorical language.
But of all nouns, those which are equivocal suit the purposes of the sophist, for by their help he effects his falla­ cies, while synonyms are of use to the poet;
I mean these which are both synonyms and of common usage, as ποϱεύησθαι and βαδίζειν, for these two are both of common usage and synonymous to each other.
The nature then of each of these varieties, and how many species of metaphor there are, and also that this ornament is of the greatest effect, as well in poetry as prose, has been explained, (as I have ob- served above,) in the Poetics.
In prose11 however we should bestow the greater attention on them, in proportion as an oration has to be made up of fewer adjuments than a metrical composition.
Moreover the metaphor possesses in an especial manner [the beauties of] clearness and sweetness, with an air of being foreign12;
and it is not possible to derive it from any other person13.
You must however apply, in the case both of epithets and metaphors, such as are appropriate ;
and this will depend on their being constructed on prin­ ciples of analogy, otherwise they will be sure to ap­ pear in bad taste;
because contraries show themselves to be such, particularly when set by each other.
But you must consider, as a purple garment becomes a youth, what is equally so to an old man;
since the same garment does not become [both].
And if you wish to embellish your subject, see you deduce your metaphor from such things coming under the same class as are better;
and if to cry it down, from such as are worse:
I mean, as the cases are opposed and come under the same genus, that the saying, for example, of a beggar, that he prays," and of one who is praying, that “he begs," (both being species of asking,) is to do the thing which has been mentioned ;
just as Iphicrates called Callias " a mere collector to the goddess, and not a bearer of the torch.”
He however replied, "that he must needs be uninitiated himself, or he would not call him a collector, but a bearer of the torch."
For these are both services connected with the goddess;
the one however is respectable, while the other is held in no repute.
And some one [speaks of the courtiers of Dionysius as] Dionysian parasites;
they however call themselves artificers14.
And these expressions are both metaphors;
the one of persons who would depreciate, the other the contrary.
Even robbers, now-a-day, call themselves purveyors15.
On which principle we may say of a man who “has acted un­ justly,” that he "is in error;
" and of one who “is in error," that he “has acted unjustly."
Again, of one who has stolen, both that has taken, [in way of diminution,] and that has ravaged [in exaggera- tion16].
But the saying, as the Telephus of Euripides does, " that he lords it o'er the oars, and landing in Mysia," etc., is out of taste;
for the expression, " lording it over," is above the dignity of the sub­ ject;
[the rhetorical artifice] then, is not palmed off17.
There will also be a fault in the syllables, unless they are significant of a grateful sound;
for instance, Dionysius, surnamed Chalcous 18, in his elegies, calls poetry, " the clangor of Calliope," be­ cause both are vocal sounds ;
the metaphor, however, is a paltry one, and couched in uncouth expressions 19.
Again, our metaphors should not be far-fetched;
but we should make the transfer, on the principle of assigning names out of the number of kindred ob­ jects, and such as are the same in species, to objects which are unnamed, of which however it is clear, simultaneously with their being uttered, that they are akin, as in that approved enigma, " A man I once beheld, [and wondering view'd,]
Who, on another, brass with fire had glued 20.”
TWINING.
for the operation is undesignated by any name 21, and both are species of attaching;
wherefore the writer called the application of the cupping instrument, a gluing.
And, generally speaking, it is possible out of neatly constructed enigmas to extract excellent metaphors:
because it is on the principles of metaphor that men construct enigmas;
so that it is evident, that [if the enigma be a good one] the metaphor has been properly borrowed.
The transfer also should be made from objects which are beautiful;
beauty however of words con­ sists, as Licymnius observes, in the sound or in the idea conveyed;
as does also their inelegance.
And there is moreover a third22, which does away the so­ phistical doctrine;
since it is not the fact, as Bryso argues, “that no one speaks inelegantly, if indeed the using one expression instead of another, carries with it the same meaning:
" for this is a fallacy;
because some words are nearer in their ordinary acceptations, more assimilated, and have more pecu­ liar force of setting the object before the eyes than others.
And what is more, one word represents the object under different circumstances from another;
so that we may even on this principle lay it down, that one word has more or less of beauty and inele­ gance than another:
for although both words, [at the same time,] express [properties which are] beau­ tiful, as well as such as are inelegant;
yet they either express them not qua they are beautiful, or not qua they are inelegant;
or granting they do, yet they express them, the one in a greater, the other in a less degree.
But we are to deduce our metaphors from these sources;
—from such as are beautiful either in sound, in meaning, or [in the image they present] to the sight, or any other sense.
And there is a dif­ ference, in the saying, for instance, " the rosy-fingered Aurora;
" rather than the purple-fingered;
" or, what is still worse, " the crimson-fingered.
”Also in the case of epithets, it is very possible to derive one's epithets from a degrading or disgraceful view of the case;
for instance, " the murderer of his mother 23:
" and we may derive them from a view on the better side;
as, the avenger of his father."
And Simonides24, when the victor in a race by mules offered him a trifling present, was not disposed to write, as though feeling hurt at writing on demi­ asses;
when, however, he offered a sufficient present, he composed the poem- Hail!
Daughters of the generous Horse, That skims, like wind, along the course, etc.
HARRIS.
and yet they were daughters of asses as well.
Again, it is possible to express the self-same thing diminu­ tively.
And it is the employment of diminutives which renders both good and evil less;
just as Aris­ tophanes jests in " The Babylonians;
" using, instead of gold, " a tiny piece of gold;
" instead of " a gar­ ment," Is a little garment;
" instead of " reproach," " puny reproach;
" and instead of " sickness," " slight indisposition."
We ought, however, to be careful, and always keep to the mean in both cases.
FRIGIDITY1, as dependent on the style, consists in four points.
In the use of compound words;
like Lycophron 2, where he says, "the many-faced hea­ ven," and " the mighty-topped earth," and " the nar­ row-pathed shore."
And as Gorgias used the expression, "a beggarly-mused flatterer," and the strictly-bound-by-oath and fully-sworn men."
Or like Alcidamas, [who talks of] " the soul replete with anger, and the visage waxing fire-coloured.”
Again, “he supposed their zeal would be completion-work­ ing ;
” and " he settled a completion-working per­ suasiveness of speech;
" and " the azure-hued level of the main."
For all these expressions, by reason of their being compounded, appear poetical3.
This, then, is one cause:
also the employment of foreign idioms is one;
as when Lycophron calls Xerxes, “prodigious hero," and Sciron, " baneful man4;
” or Alcidamas, when he says, “gambollings in poetry," and “nature's improbity," and " whetted by unrestrained rage of soul.
"A third description of frigidity consists in the em- plyment of epithets either too long, out of place, or too frequent;
for in poetry, indeed, it is becoming enough to say " white milk;
" in prose, however, it is rather bad taste.
Some also, should there be a su­ perabundance of them, betray [the rhetorician's art], and make it evident that the whole is a mere made-up thing;
this, however, you may occasionally avail your­ self of, since it produces a departure from the ordinary style, and renders the diction foreign.
Yet ought we to aim at the mean;
for [the too free indulgence in the licence] does more harm than the speaking care­ lessly ;
for the one has no beauty, the other has [positive] fault.
Hence it is that the writings of Al­ cidamas appear frigid;
for he employs epithets not as the seasoning, but as the food, with such profusion does he scatter them, and those both too long, and where the meaning is self-evident:
thus, he does not say the sweat, but the moist sweat5:
” nor to the Isthmian games, but " to Isthmus’ full assemblage nor does he speak of laws;
but of " the laws, the sovereigns of states:
" nor, of the race;
but of " the soul's rapid impulse:
" nor of a museum;
but of " taking nature's museum with you:
" and of " rueful care of the soul."
Nor does he speak of favour;
but of " the fabricator of a whole people's favour:
" and of " a dispenser of the pleasure of his audience."
[He would not tell you] of branches;
but " amid the branches of the wood did he conceal it:
" nor, that he covered his person ;
but " the nakedness of his per­ son and of “desire the counter-rival of the soul:
” (for this is at once a compound word and an epithet, so that it becomes poetry:
) and of " such an ill­ omen'd excess of improbity."
Hence those who ex­ press themselves with this poetic air, produce by their want of taste both the ridiculous and the frigid, and from their loquacious prosing, become deficient in clearness ;
for whenever one unnecessarily obtrudes any thing on an auditor who already apprehends him, putting an end to all perspicuity, he produces ob­ scurity.
People, however, do employ compounds, when the subject is without a proper appellative, and the com­ position is easily effected:
for instance “pastime;
” but if it occur frequently, it is decidedly poetical.
Wherefore a style characterized by compounds, is most available to the Dithyrambic poets;
for such words are sonorous:
exotic words are most useful to epic poets6;
for they have something dignified and superb:
metaphor however to iambic verse;
for [dra­ matists] now employ it, as has been already stated.
Moreover, fourthly, frigidity originates in metaphor;
for there are even metaphors which are unbecoming:
some, from their being ridiculous7;
for the writers of comedy employ metaphor :
others, from their being too dignified, and having too great an air of tragedy8;
and should they be far-fetched, they become indistinct;
like Gorgias, [when he talks of] things as wan, and [again] as ruddy. "
You have sown in shame, and reaped in ruin;
" for this has too much the air of poetry.
And as Alcidamas, [who calls] "philosophy the rampart of the laws;
” and " the Odyssey a beau­ tiful mirror of human life9."
Again, introducing no such gambolling in poetry:
" since all these ex­ pressions, for the reasons above-mentioned, are des­ titute of persuasive efficacy.
But what Gorgias said on a swallow, when in its flight it had muted on him, was in the best style of tragedy;
for he exclaimed, " Oh! fie Philomela;
” for to a bird, indeed, the act was not unbecoming, to a young lady, however, it would have been.
So that he reproached her neatly enough, speaking of her as what she had been, not as what she then was.
THE simile, too, is in fact metaphor;
for the differ- ence is trifling:
tor when [the poet says of Achilles, “Like a lion he leaped on them," it is a simile;
but when he says, “A very lion he leaped on them," it is a metaphor:
for since both are brave, [the poet,] making the transfer, has spoken of Achilles as a lion.
The simile is useful too in prose, though seldom, since it carries with it the air of poetry.
And you must introduce them just as you would metaphors;
for they are metaphors differing in that particular which has been stated1.
The following are similes ;
viz. that which Andro­ tion employed against Idrieus, that " he was like pup­ pies loosed from their chain for they rushing at people bite them, and Idrieus, too, now that he was discharged, was a dangerous person.
Again, as The­ odamus, in a simile, compared Archidamus to Eux­ enus, without his knowledge of geometry;
on the principles of similar ratios:
for [conversely] Euxenus would be Archidamus, had [the latter] a knowledge of geometry.
Also the instance which occurs in the Politeia of Plato, that those who spoil the dead are like young dogs, "which bite the stone, without touching the person who throws it."
Also the [si­ mile] which he employed against the populace, " that it was like a pilot, strong indeed, but rather deaf."
And of the metres of poets, " they are like those in the prime of youth who are without beauty for the latter having lost their freshness, and the former their numerical arrangement, are no longer like the same thing.
Also the simile of Pericles against the Samians, [who said] "they were like young children, who indeed accept the sop, but still cry:
" and against the Bœo­ tians, that " they were like holm-oaks;
for these holm-oaks are cut down by their own means2, as were also the Boeotians, in their contests with each other."
And what Demosthenes used before the po­ pulace, that " it is like those who are sea-sick when on board."
So, too, Democritus likened the orators to nurses, “who, swallowing the sop themselves, be­ smear the infants with spittle."
And in the same way Antisthenes likened Cephisidotus the slim to frank­ incense, for "in its consumption it spreads universal delight."[
Thus the simile is metaphor], for it is free to you to enunciate all these both as metaphors and as si­ miles.
So that it is plain that as many as, when enunciated as metaphors, are approved, will also be­ come similes;
and [vice versâ] the similes, when without the note [of similitude], will become meta­ phors.
But the metaphor, which is constructed on the principle of similar ratios, ought always to admit of paying back [the borrowed term3] ;
as also in other cases, and in that of [metaphor], from species to spe­ cies :
for instance, if a cup be called " the shield of Bacchus," it is also proper to call a shield " the cup of Mars."
Of these materials, then, is a discourse made up.
BUT purity in speaking your language1 is the found- ation of all style ;
and this depends on five particu­ lars.
First, on the connective particles 2, whether one pay them back or not, just as they are of a na­ ture to precede or follow, and as each requires ;
thus, although and on my part, require yet and on his part [to follow them].
And it is necessary to make a re­ turn of the one to the other while it is yet recollect­ ed, and not to suspend them at too great intervals:
neither should we [ insert another] connective before making a return to the connective which already has a claim on us;
for in very few instances is this ap­ propriate.
"But I, after he spoke to me, for Cleon came up beseeching me and putting it to me, went, taking them along with me:
" for in these words many connectives are thrown in before the first con­ nective has been paid back ;
and if the interval be­ tween the words “I” and "went" be great, a want of clearness takes place.
One source then of correct- ness originates in the connectives.
And a second, in the expressing yourself in the appropriate terms, and not in generals 3.
A third, in terms which are not ambiguous:
this, however, only when you do not de­ liberately choose the opposite;
the very thing which they do, who, whilst they have nothing to say, yet affect to say something marvellous;
for such persons, in their invention of somewhat to say, give vent to these terms, just as Empedocles did.
For the cir­ cumlocution by its length imposes on people, and the auditors are affected in the very self-same way as the populace in transactions with soothsayers;
for when they utter their ambiguities, they yield assent as they go on;
[as in the famous oracle], " Crœsus having crossed the Halys will overthrow a mighty empire."
And it is because the chance of mistake is less, that soothsayers express themselves in generals on their subject:
for in "even and odd' he will more frequently be right who cries [only generally] either " even" or “odd" than one who would [specify] the exact number;
and so one who predicts simply that a thing will happen, than he who would subjoin when5.
On which account the soothsayers never add the further distinction of “when.”
All these errors then are similar;
so that, unless it be with a view to some such end, they are to be avoided.
The fourth essential is the preserving the distinc- tion which Protagoras marked out between the gen­ ders of nouns, viz.
masculine, feminine, and neuter;
for it will be necessary to make these correspond correctly.
Thus, " She, having come and having conversed, departed.
"The fifth consists in correctly quoting the plural, dual, and singular numbers.
"They, coming up, commenced beating me.
”In a word, the written style ought to be easily read and understood;
and in these requisites it is the same [as that of recitation];
the very qualities however these which numerous connectives do not possess:
neither the compositions which it is not easy to point, as those of Heraclitus.
For the point­ ing of Heraclitus' works is quite a task, from its being far from clear whether words refer to those which precede or those which follow them6.
For example, in the beginning of his work, " Of reason existing always men are ignorant:
" for it is not clear to which branch of the sentence we should point off the " always.
"This moreover produces a solecism;
the failure in paying back the idea, it, [in the case of two words,] you do not bring each under an expression adapted to both 7:
for example, to the words " colour or sound," the expression "seeing" has not a com­ mon reference;
whereas the expression " perceiving" has.
Again, sentenced become indistinct, if, delay­ ing to thrust in many intermediate remarks, you do not put first and state [what naturally comes first].
For example, " For I intended, after I had conversed with him on this and that subject, and so on, to depart:
" not, [stating it naturally thus,] "For I intended to depart;
" and afterwards introducing, " after I had conversed on this and that, and so on.
"THE following expedients contribute to elevation of the style, viz.—the employing the definition instead of the noun;
saying, for instance, not " a circle," but "a plane superficies, whose circumference is at all points equidistant from the centre."
The reverse, however, viz. the use of the noun instead of the de­ finition, contributes to abruptness.
Again, [the avoiding either, if it be indelicate or unbecoming ;
i. e. using the noun, if the indelicacy be in the definition ;
or the definition, if it be in the noun.
Also, the illustration of the subject by metaphor and epithets, guarding, however, against what savours of poetry.
And the putting what is but single as many, the thing which the poets do:
though the haven be but one, yet they tell you of " Grecian - havens;
”—and, “the letters' many-opening folds 1.”
Also, the not bringing all your words under a common particle, but assigning to each its own:
This woman, this my wife."
And the expressing yourself with a connective ;
but if abruptly, without a connective indeed, though not unconnectedly;
for instance, " Having departed and having spoken to him ;
" or, " having departed, I spoke to him.
"The precept of Antimachus, too, is of service, viz.
the drawing your expressions from absent qualities2, which he does in celebrating the hill Teumessus, [commencing,] " There is a certain little hill visited by the winds for thus the subject is carried on to infinity.
And this expedient holds good alike in the case of qualities which are good, and such as are bad4, just as the subject has them not, in whichever way it may be of service.
Hence the poets deduce their expressions5, the "stringless" and the lyre­ less melody;
" for they build their epithets on priva­ tives.
And this expedient is also approved in ana­ logical metaphors;
for instance, the saying of " a trumpet," that it is a " lyreless harmony."
STYLE will possess the quality of being in good taste, if it be expressive at once of feeling and character, and in proportion to1 the subject-matter.
This pro­ portion, however, is preserved, provided the style be neither careless on questions of dignity, nor dignified on such as are mean :
neither to a mean word let or­ nament be superadded;
otherwise it appears mere burlesque;
as Cleophon uses to do;
for he has ex­ pressed some things equally ridiculously, as though he were to say, " August fig-tree.
"But [the style expressive of feeling, supposing the case be one of assault, is the style of a man in a passion;
if, however, it be one of loathsomeness and impiety, the expressing yourself with disgust and painful caution ;
if, however, the case demand praise, with exultation ;
if pity, with submission ;
and so on in the other cases.
And a style which is appropriate, moreover, invests the subject with persuasive efficacy.
For the mind is cheated into a persuasion, that the orator is speaking with sincerity, because, under such circumstances, men stand affected in that manner.
So that people suppose things to be even as the speaker states them, what though, in reality, they are not:
and the hearer has a kindred feeling with the orator, who expresses himself feelingly, even should he say nothing to the purpose;
availing themselves of which, many bear down their hearers in the storm of passion.
But moreover, this mode of showing by means of signs is expressive of character;
because, on every condition and habit of life, is consequent a language suited to it.
I use the expression condition, in refer­ ence to the stage of life ;
as youth, manhood, or age;
and [to the sex], as man, or woman;
and [to na- tion], as Lacedæmonian, or Thessalian. [I mean] by habits, those conformably to which one is of a certain character in life;
for it is not according to every habit that the life assumes a certain character:
if then one express himself in the language appro­ priate to the habit, he will produce the effect of being characteristic;
for a rustic and a man of education, will express themselves neither in the same words, nor in the same manner.
And the auditors are affected, in some way, by that feeling of which the declaimers avail themselves, till it nauseates ;
[put­ ting it to their audience thus], " who knows not ? ”— " all men know it."
For the auditor acknowledges with a kind of confusion, that he participates [in that information] which all the rest of the world possess.
The employment of them opportunely, or inoppor- tunely, is, however, a consideration common to every species [of ornament;
but for every excess [in them], there is that corrective which is in the mouth of every body ;
for, of yourself, you should append a reproof on yourself ;
for it appears in reality [an ornament], at least since the use of it does not escape the notice of the speaker himself.
Further, the speaker is not at once to employ every thing which is proportionate;
for thus the hearer has the deceit passed off on him.
I mean that, if the terms be harsh, he is not to em­ ploy a harsh tone and expression of countenance, and the other peculiarities [of harshness] :
if this caution be not observed, [our artifices] severally appear what they really are.
But if he employ some and not others, without observation he produces the same effect.
Still, if expressions of softness be uttered harshly, and such as are harsh with softness, they become divested of efficacy to persuade.
But com- pound words, and a plurality of epithets, and foreign idioms, are appropriate chiefly to one who speaks under the excitement of some passion ;
-for with one, [for instance,] who is affected by anger, we have a fellow-feeling in his calling his wrongs heaven- measuring," or “prodigious:
” they are so, too, when one is already master of his audience, and has wrought them up to enthusiasm, either by panegyric or invective, by [the excitement] of anger or friendly feeling ;
the which Isocrates does in “The Panegy­ ric," near the conclusion ;
"-the record and remem­ brance ;
" and, "men who had the spirit—.”
For the speaker, in a transport of enthusiasm, gives utterance to expressions such as these ;
so that the audience also, being forsooth similarly affected them­ selves, readily welcome them.
Wherefore they are adapted to poetry;
for poetry is the language of enthusiasm.
It is, then, either in this way [that we are to em­ ploy poetical expressions], or in irony;
as Gorgias was in the habit of doing;
and [as Socrates does] in the Phædrus [of Plato].
THE modelling of the diction should, however, be neither metrical nor without rhythm 1:
for the first has no persuasive efficacy (since it appears to have been got up), and at the same time it also draws off [the attention];
for it causes one to fix his attention on the similarities of cadence, when they will recur again;
just in the way that little children anticipate the crier;
(for when he demands,—“Whom does this freedman choose as his patron?”—[they ex­ claim], "Cleon:
") that, however, which is without rhythm, has no measure.
The diction ought, however, to be measured, yet without metre ;
for what is desti­ tute of measure is displeasing and indistinct.
But by number all things are measured;
and in model­ ling the diction, the number is rhythmI, of which the metres are certain divisions 3.
Hence the sentence should possess rhythm, though not metre;
for then it will become verse;
and its very rhythm should be without preciseness.
This, however, will be the case if, up to a certain point, it be preserved.
But of the rhythms, the heroic is stately, and not adapted to conversation, and deficient in varied ca­ dence ;
the iambic, however, is the very style of the multitude;
whence it is that persons in conversation give utterance to iambic lines, most of all metres.
But [in a speech] there should be a degree of stateli­ ness and departure from [the ordinary phrase].
Yet the trochaic metre is too trippings;
and all tetrame­ ters show it;
for tetrameters are a kind of dancing rhythm 5.
But the paean remains, which orators, com- mencing with Thrasymachus, began to employ;
they were not, however, able to explain what it was.
Yet the paean is the third, and comes next to those [rhythms] which have been mentioned;
for it is as three to two.
But of the former [rhythms, the ratio is] of the one, [the heroic,] as one to one;
of the others, [the iambic and trochaic,] as two to one.
But next to these ratios ranks that of whole and half7;
and this is the paean.
The others then are to be abandoned for the reasons stated, and because they are resolvable into verse:
the paean is, however, to be retained;
since out of that only rhythm, of all which have been mentioned, it is not possible to con­ struct any metre;
so that [in employing it] most of all rhythms, an orator will elude detection8.
At present, indeed, the orators employ one paean, [as well in concluding] as on opening;
the conclu­ sion, however, ought to differ from the opening [of a speech].
And there are two species of paeans, op­ posed to each other;
whereof the one is adapted to the opening, (just, in fact, as they employ it;
) this is that one of which the long syllable is first, and the three short ones at the end, [as in the word]
Δᾱλο̆γένε̆ς, and Χϱῡσε̆οκο̆μᾰ.
The other, however, contrariwise, is that whereof the three short syllables are first, and the long at the end, [as in the conclusion of the line]— Afterwards night obscured both earth, and water, and ocean.
This [pæan] makes a good conclusion;
whereas the short syllable, owing to its being incomplete, renders the sentence mutilated.
But it is right to break off with a long syllable, for your conclusion to be clearly marked, not by means of the amanuensis, nor merely by annotations on the margin, but by means of the rhythm.
That, then, the diction should be conformable to rhythm, and not deficient in it, the particular rhythms too which will render it so conformable, and these under what arrangement, have been stated.
THE style must needs be either continuous, and united by means of connectives, just like the protracted odes of the dithyrambic poets 2;
or reflex, and like the antistrophic odes of the old poets.
Now the continuous style is the old style, as, " This is the exposition of the historical research of Hero­ dotus, of Thurium3,” etc.
For formerly indeed every one employed it, but now very few.
I call that continuous, which in itself has no termination, should not the circumstance under narration have been terminated.
But it is unpleasant, from its being indefinite;
for all like to descry the end.
Wherefore it is that racers pant and faint away just at the turn ;
for before, while they have the goal in view before them, they do not tire.
The continuous style, then, is this.
But the reflex is that which consists of periods.
I call a period a form of words which has independ­ ently in itself a beginning and ending, and a length easily taken in at a glance.
A diction of this descrip­ tion is pleasing, and easily conveys information :
now it is pleasing from its being the opposite of that which is indefinite 4;
and because the hearer all along supposes that he is securing something, from the cir­ cumstance that something is constantly finished off for him ;
but the not foreseeing nor despatching any thing is unpleasant:
and it easily conveys informa­ tionI because it is easily remembered;
this, however, is the case, because the diction which consists of pe­ riods has number, which of all things is most easily recollected.
And hence every one remembers verse better than prose;
for it has numbers by which it is measured, The period ought also to be terminated with the sense, and not to be interrupted like this verse of Sophocles,- " This is Calydon, land of the territory of Pelops 5.”
For by dividing it is possible to understand the con­ trary [of the fact], as in the case of the instance cited, that Calydon is in Peloponnesus.
A period either consists of clauses, or is simple.
But the period consisting of clauses is a mode of speech perfect and distinct, and easily pronounced at a breath;
not, however, at the point of division, like the fore-mentioned period, but altogether.
And a clause is one subdivision of it.
By a simple period, I mean one consisting of a single clause.
But neither the clauses nor the periods ought to be either curtailed or prolix ;
for their brevity often causes the hearer to feel a hitch;
since it needs must be, if while he is yet [in thought] hastening onward, that limit of termination which he conceives within himself happens to be thrown back by the speaker's ceasing, that a kind of hitch, as it were, occurs, owing to the impulse backward.
Those, however, which are prolix cause the hearer to be left behind;
just as they who make the turn too far on the outside of the goal, for they don't keep up with those walking with them 6;
and in a similar way, periods which are prolix grow into an oration, and are something like a desultory ode7.
So that that occurs which Demo­ critus, the Chian, joked Melanippides about, viz. that he produced desultory odes instead of antistrophes. "
A man in framing a nuisance for others, frames one for himself;
and long tedious odes are the great­ est nuisance to him who produces them8;
" for it is appropriate enough to hold such language as this respecting the framers of prolix clauses.
But those which are brief in their clauses do not, in fact, be­ come periods ;
therefore they draw on the hearer by fits and starts.
Of style which consists of periods, one species is merely divided [by disjunctives], another has an an­ tithesis.
Simply divided, as, “I have often felt sur­ prised at those who convened the general assemblies and 9 established the gymnastic contests."
The style, however, which has antithesis, is that in which, in each clause, either there is one contrary put in con­ junction with another, or the same is linked in con­ nexion with contraries:
as, "
They benefited both, as well those who remained behind, as those who joined the expedition;
since they made acquisitions for the latter more than they possessed at home;
while to the former they abandoned, in what remained at home, a full competence."
The ideas set in opposition are,-staying behind,-joining the expedition ;
com­ petence,—more.
[And in this sentence] :
"
So that both to those who wanted money, and to those who desired to enjoy it?
etc.
Here enjoyment stands op­ posed to acquisition.
And again:
"It happens fre­ quently in these cases, that while the prudent fail, the simple succeed.”—“Forthwith, indeed, they claim­ ed the prize of highest valour, and not long after they gained the sovereignty of the sea.”—
“That he sailed, indeed, through the main land, and marched across the sea;
joining with a bridge the Hellespont, while he channelled through mount Athos."
Again:
"
That, citizens though they were by birth, they were yet de­ prived by law of their franchise in the city”—
“While some of them miserably perished, others were dis­ gracefully preserved."
Again:
"
That privately, in­ deed, he employed barbarian slaves;
while in public he allowed many of the allies to be in slavery —
“Either they would possess it while alive, or leave it behind when dead."
Again, the expression which some one made use of against Pitholaus and Lyco­ phron in the court:
" They sold you, indeed, when they were at home;
but when they were come to us, they were themselves bought.
”
—For all these [anti­ theses] produce the fore-mentioned effect.
And a style of this description is pleasing, because contraries are most easily apprehended, and, when set by each other's side, they become still more easy of apprehension:
and because they bear a resemblance to a reasoning process;
for the elenchus is an infer­ ence of contraries.
Such, then, is antithesis:
—but an equipoise occurs if the clauses be equal;
and allitera­ tion, if each of the clauses have its extremities simi­ lar :
and [this similarity] it needs must have either at the beginning or ending;
and the beginning al­ ways has original words [similar10];
but the ending, either last syllables [which are similar], or inflections of the same word, or the same word itself.
Instances of alliteration] at the beginning, are as follow11:
For he received from him land untill d.
By presents pleased, by words appeased.
And at the ending, thus:
They thought that he was the father, but that there was a cause for it.
Anxiety at the highest, hope at the lowest.
Inflections of the same word,—“What!
give him a brazen statue who did not deserve a brass farthing ?”
The same word,—“In his life you spoke ill of him, and now after his death you write ill."
And on a single syllable,—“What ill would you have suffered, if you had witnessed an indolent man ?
"And it is possible for the same words to possess, at the same time, all these ;
and for the same example to be both an antithesis, equipoised, and having rhyme.
But the heads of periods have nearly been enumerat­ ed in my Rhetoric to Theodectes.
Also there are false antitheses, such as Epicharmus was in the habit of making:
as, “Once was I in their [country] ;
once was I among them."
BUT as a detail of these subjects has been given, we must state whence the elegancies and approved beau­ ties [of style] are derived.
Now the power of in­ venting them belongs, either to the man of high na­ tural genius, or to one of talent chastened by discipline;
but to eXhibit the sources of them is the business of this system;
wherefore, let us treat of, and fully enumerate them.
And let this be our fundamental principle:
for the receiving information with ease, is naturally pleasing to all1;
and nouns are significant of something ;
so that all those nouns whatsoever which produce know­ ledge in the mind, are most pleasing.
Now, the fo­ reign expressions are unintelligible;
and words of common use we already understand.
But the meta­ phor in the highest degree produces this effect [of giving pleasure];
for when the poet calls old age "stubble," he produces in us a knowledge and in- formation by means of a common genus2;
for both are past their prime.
Now, the similes of the poets also produce the same effect;
on which account, should they be neatly managed, an elegance strikes you.
For the simile, as has been remarked before3, is me­ taphor with the difference of the addition [of a par­ ticle denoting similitude];
on which account it is less pleasing, because more at length:
and it does not assert that " this is that;
" the mind therefore does not at all require it4.
It cannot but be, then, both that the style and the arguments which render the act of information rapid, are elegant;
on which account, neither are superfi­ cial arguments held in approbation;
(for, by super­ ficial, I mean such as are obvious to every one, and which require no search;
) nor those which, when stated, are not understood5:
but all those whatsoever which are apprehended, either simultaneously with their being uttered, (supposing even that no previous knowledge of them existed,) or by which the intellect is a little left behind;
for there accrues, as it were, a piece of information ;
in the two former cases, how­ ever, none.
As far, then, as respects the meaning of what is said, reasonings of this description are approved;
but as to the expression, if they be worded (in figure) antithetically6;
as, "deeming the common peace of the rest, a very war to their individual interests here " war" is opposed to " peace;
" and (in single words) if they possess metaphor, and this neither far- fetched, for it will be difficult to view it in connexion ;
nor superficial, for it produces no effect:
and, more­ over, if they place the object before your eyes ;
for it needs must be, that one sees more clearly what is ac­ tually in the course of being done, than what is about to be.
We ought then to aim at three things, meta­ phor, antithesis, and personification7.
But of metaphor, which is fourfold,8 that species is in the highest degree approved which is construct­ ed on similar ratios;
just as Pericles said, that the youth which had perished in the war, had so vanished from the city, as if one were to take the spring from the year9."
And Leptines, speaking of the Lacedæ­ monians, " that he would do all in his power to pre­ vent Greece from being deprived of an eye."
And Cephisodotus, when Chares was eager to present the accounts about the Olynthiac war, grew nettled, and said, " Now that he has got the populace with their necks in a halter, he is endeavouring to present his accounts."
Again, when he once was exhorting the Athenians, as they were going for provisions, to go to Euboea for them, he said, " the decree of Miltiades should go forth to the expedition.”
And Iphicrates, when the Athenians had made a league with Epidau­ rus and the neighbourhood of the coast, was indig­ nant, and exclaimed that, " of themselves they had cut off the very provision of the war."
And Pitho- laus called [the state yacht] Paralus, "the mace of the populace;
" and Sestus, " the corn-chest of the Piræus.”
And Pericles bade them away with Ægina, " the eye-sore of the Piraeus."
And Mœrocles said, " that he was no more a knave than the other," nam­ ing some good sort of man;
" since that person in­ deed played the rogue at the rate of thirty per cent., himself however merely at ten per cent. usury10.”
And that iambic verse of Anaxandrides on his daughters, who were long in getting married:
" The virgins have forfeited the nuptial recognisance11.”
And that saying of Polyeuctus about one Speusippus, who was struck by apoplexy, "that he was unable to keep quiet, bound as he was by fortune in a complete pillory of a disease."
Cephisodotus, too, used to call the triremes, " painted corn-mills:
” as did the Cynic Diogenes the taverns, "the public tables 12 of Athens."
Æsion, too, used the expression, "pouring out the city into Sicily," (for this is metaphorical, and sets the object before the eyes,) " so that all Greece ex­ claimed;
” and this too is in a certain way a metaphor, and personifies.
And as Cephisodotus bade them be on their guard, " lest they rendered their very popu­ lar assemblies so many rows;
” just as Isocrates, also, [ used the expression] of persons “making a row in the general convention."
And as in the funeral speech [of Lycias], " there was reason for Greece to shear her locks over the grave of those who fell at Salamis, since her liberty had been buried jointly with their valour:
" for had he said that " there was reason she should weep, her liberty having been buried with them;
" it would indeed have been a metaphor, and have given personification;
but the words, “their valour," " her liberty," convey a kind of antithesis.
And, as Iphicrates said, " The path of my arguments is through the midst of the actions of Chares:
" the metaphor here is on similar ratios, and the expres­ sion, " through the midst," produces personification.
Also the saying, " that he challenged dangers to be his allies against dangers," is both a personification and a metaphor.
And Lycoleon, pleading for Cha­ brias, said, " [What, not pardon him] out of a respect for the suppliancy13 of his brazen statue:
" for in the then crisis it was a metaphor, but not always;
but the personification [was perpetual] ;
for pending his trial the statue acts as suppliant, the inanimate as an animated object,—“that memento of the exploits of the state."
Again, "Making it their study, by every means, to think meanly;
" [this is metaphorical,] since study is with a view to advance [not to diminish].
And the expression that “God has kindled the intel­ lect as a light in the soul;
" for both in a certain sense illuminate.
—
“For we put no period to our wars, but put them off since both putting off, and a peace of this description, are alike things of the future.
And again, the declaring " that a truce was a trophy more splendid than those won in war ;
since the latter was the result of a trivial occurrence or a single accident, the former were the result of the whole tenour of the war;
" for both [agree in being] indications of victory.
And, that " states pay a heavy punishment to the censure of mankind;
" for punishment is a sort of hurt consonant to justice14.
Thus, then, it has been stated that the elegancies result from metaphor constructed on similar ratios, and from personification.
BUT it must be stated what we mean by the expres- sion, " setting forth to the eyes, and in doing what this effect results.
I mean, then, that those expres­ sions which represent the object as in action, do all of them produce the setting before the eyes:
for in­ stance, the saying of " a good man," that he is " a cube 1,” is a metaphor;
for both are perfect;
but this does not personify:
whereas the speaking of one as " having his prime yet blooming," is a personification.
And this, "-but you just as a thing let loose," is a personification.
And [in the line] "
Then the Greeks springing forth with their feet2;
—” the expression, it springing," is both a personification and a metaphor, for it expresses rapidity.
Again, as Homer has in many places employed it, the putting inanimate things as animate, by means of a metaphor;
and in all from their producing personification, they are approved;
as in these instances3:
" Back to the plain still roll'd the shameless stone."
Again, " The arrow flew.”
And, " Eager to wing its way."
And, " Deep fix'd in earth, eager their blood to drain."
And, " Right through his breast th' impetuous weapon sped."
For in all these instances, the objects, from their being animated, appear personified;
for the expres­ sions, shamelessness, and eagerness, and the rest, are personifications.
These, however, has he ap­ pended by means of the metaphor from analogy :
for as the stone is to Sisyphus, so is he who is insensible of shame, to the object in regard to which he is so insensible.
He does this, too, in his approved similes, in the case of inanimate objects ;
as, " The waves behind impel the waves before, Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore4.” for he produces every thing in life and action.
But personification is an imitation [of nature5].
But it is fitting to draw your metaphors, as has been stated, from terms which are appropriate and not obvious;
just as in philosophy, also, it is the privilege of one who conjectures happily, to discern the point of similitude6;
as when Archytas observes, “that an arbitrator and an altar are the same," since to both does the party who has been wronged fly for refuge.
Or if one were to say, " that an anchor and a pot-hanger were the same;
” for both are some­ what the same, but they differ in the circumstance of suspending from above and below.
Again, the expression, “the states have been levelled,” is the same in objects widely differing, equality both in power and in superficies.
Also the greatest number of elegancies arise from metaphor, and from additionally deceiving the hear­ er7;
for the point becomes more clear that he has learnt something, from the meaning being the oppo­ site [of what it was supposed], and the mind seems to say, " How true is this !
I however was wrong."
And the elegancies of proverbial expressions arise from one's meaning not what he says;
for instance, the words of Stesichorus, that “ the grasshoppers shall chirp on the ground8."
Also ideas neatly put enigmatically, are for the same reason pleasing;
for there is an acquisition of knowledge, and a metaphor is introduced.
Again, that embellishment which Theodorus calls, " saying out-of-the-way things;
" this, however, occurs when the sentiment is paradox­ ical, and (as he has it) does not square with previous opinion9;
just on the same principle as in jokes, words submitted to a slight change.
An effect which those jests also produce, which depend on the change of a letter, for they deceive [the hearer's anticipa­ tion] :
it happens also in metre;
for it terminates not in the way in which the hearer supposed;
thus, He proceeded wearing under his feet—chilblains 10.
Whereas the hearer was imagining that " sandals” (πέδιλα), would be the word
This, however, as soon as it is uttered, ought to be clear.
But these changes of a letter cause the speaker to say, not what the word expresses, but what its inversion signifies:
as in the jest of Theodorus, on Nicon the lyrist, "Thee did a Thracian—” (Θράττη);
for what he pretends to say is, " It annoys (Θράττει) you 12,” and deceives the audience ;
wherefore to one who has caught it, the joke is pleasing;
since if one is not aware that he is a Thracian, it will not appear to be a beauty.
Again, the expression, you wish him περσαι [i. e. either to side with Persia—to ruin him].
Both meanings, however, should be in point, and so also in the case of the elegancies;
thus the saying, " The sovereignty (ἀρχὴ) of the sea, was not the be­ ginning (ἀρχὴ) of evils to the Athenians;
since it was a gain to them."
Or, as Isocrates says, “that its sovereignty (ἀρχὴ) was to the city a beginning (ἀρχὴ) of evils."
For in either acceptation, that is stated which one did not imagine he would say;
and that it is true, is acknowledged.
For to assert that a beginning is a beginning, shows no great wisdom ;
but he repeats [the word ἀρχὴ], not in this sense, but differently;
and he does not repeat the same ἀρχὴ which he first said, but in a different sense.
And in all these cases, if one introduce the term appropriately under an equivocation or metaphor, then there is wit;
for instance, there is no bearing Baring13:
here the speaker denies the correspond­ ence of signification, but appropriately enough, if [the person alluded to] be disagreeable."
Again, "
You cannot become more a stranger [ξένος], than becomes you as a guest [ξένος],” or not in a greater degree than you ought, which is the same;
and " it becomes not a stranger [ξένος] always to be a guest [ξένος].”
For the meanings here also are different.
The same, too, is that commended saying of Anax­ andrides, " It is honourable to die before doing aught worthy death;
” for it is the same as saying, "It is worthy a man to die when he is not worthy to suffer death;
" or, " It is worthy a man to die when he is not worthy [the punishment] of death;
or, when he has not committed acts worthy that punishment."
Now the form of the diction of these sentences is the same;
but in proportion as [the idea] happens to be enunciated in fewer words and with antithesis, in the same proportion is it more approved.
And the rea­ son is, that the information becomes by means of the antithesis, fuller;
by means of brevity, more rapid.
Such sentiments ought always to have either some one of whom they are said, or happiness of expres­ sion (if what you say [would appear] earnest, and not mere idle remark);
for it is possible to have one of those qualities without the other:
for instance, " You ought to die without having committed an error;
" [the sentiment is just enough], but [the ex­ pression is not elegant:
" A deserving man should marry a deserving woman;
" but this is not ele­ gant14;
but if it possess both qualities at the same time, as "
It is worthy a man to die while he is not worthy of suffering death."
But in proportion as a sentence possesses the greater number of these orna­ ments, in the same proportion does it appear more elegant;
if, for instance, the words be metaphors, and metaphors of such a species15, and if there be antithesis, and equipoise of clauses, and if it have personification.
Similes also, as has been uniformly stated in the foregoing, are in some way approved metaphors;
for they always are expressed in two terms, like the ana­ logical metaphor;
thus, " the shield," we say, " is the cup of Mars;
" the bow, " a stringless lyre."
Thus, then, persons express the metaphor not unaccom­ panied ;
whereas the calling a bow, " a lyre;
" or a shield “a cup," is without accompanying explan- ation 16.
And on this principle men construct their similes ;
for instance, that of a flute-player to an ape, and of a near-sighted person to a sputtering lamp;
for both contract themselves.
But the excel­ lence will exist when there is a metaphor;
for you may represent by a simile the shield as " the cup of Mars," and a ruin as " the rags of a house ;
" and the saying of Niceratus, that, " he was himself a Philoc­ tetes bitten by Pratys," as Thrasymachus drew the simile when he saw Niceratus, who had been beaten by Pratys in a contest of rhapsodists 17, with his hair long and disordered, and his person still neglected.
In which points, if they be not neatly managed, the poets most frequently get hissed off, even should they in other respects stand high.
I mean when the poet replies [to his particle of similitude thus], " Like parsley he has crooked legs.”—“Like Phi­ lammon on the bench, struggling with the ball" [or, with Corycus].
And all such expressions are si­ miles ;
but that similes are metaphors has frequently been stated.
Proverbs also are metaphors from species to spe- cies:
thus it any one, as though likely to experience a benefit, should himself introduce a measure and afterwards suffer loss from it, then one exclaims, “As the Carpathian fetched the hare 18 !" for both parties have experienced the thing in point.
Now the sources whence these elegancies are deduced, and the cause why [they are pleasing], has nearly been told you.
Again, hyperboles which are recognised are meta- phors;
as that about a person with a black eye:
" You would have thought him a basket of mulber­ ries for the part beneath the eye is somewhat suf­ fused with blood:
but this is greatly forced.
But the [simile with the expression of similitude] just as, so and so, is hyperbole, differing merely in the dic­ tion.
Like Philammon on the bench struggling with the ball," [becomes hyperbole thus;
]
“You would have thought he was Philammon struggling with the ball." "
Like parsley he has crooked legs," [thus arranged becomes an hyperbole;
] "I thought not that he had legs, but parsley stalks, so crooked were they."
But hyperboles suit with the temper- ament of the young, for they evince a vehemence of temper;
(on which account the angry most frequently utter them;
[thus Achilles in his wrath exclaims,]
Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more
Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore, * * * * * * Atrides* daughter never shall be led, An ill-match'd consort to Achilles' bed;
Like golden Venus though she charm'd the heart, Or vied with Pallas in the works of art19.
POPE.
The Attic rhetoricians, too, particularly employ this figure ;
) on which account for a man in advanced life to utter them is bad taste.
NEITHER ought it to escape us, that to each kind of rhetoric is adapted a peculiar style;
for neither are the style which is adapted to writing and that of dis­ putation the same, nor the style of deliberative and that of judicial rhetoric.
But it is necessary to be acquainted with both [the first and the second] :
for the one consists in knowing the purity of language ;
the other in the not being obliged to sit mute, if one wish to communicate any thing to others;
the very predicament in which they who know not how to write are placed.
But the style of writing is the most precise:
that of disputation partakes more of declam­ ation ;
and of it there are two species, the one conveys the impress of character, the other of feeling.
And hence actors choose this description of drama, and the poets this sort [ of actors].
But poets fit for perusal are carried about with us, like Chœremon, for he is as nicely finished as a rhetorician ;
and, of the Dithy­ rambic poets, Licymnius.
Thus also, on comparing speeches together, those adapted to writing appear jejune when delivered at disputations ;
while those of the declaimers, excellent as they were when delivered, seem mere common- place in the closet;
and the reason is, that in disputa­ tion [these things] are appropriate enough.
On which account, compositions trained for declamation, inas­ much as, when abridged of their declamation, they do not produce their effect, appear ridiculous :
thus, the omission of connectives, and frequent repetitions, in a written style are justly exploded;
yet in the style of disputation even the rhetoricians employ them, for they are adapted to declamation.
Yet it is necessary in repeating the same thing to vary the expression;
which indeed opens a way, as it were, to declamation:
[e. g.] "
This is he who robbed you ;
this is he who defrauded you ;
this is he who at last endeavoured to betray you."
Just as Philemon the actor used to do in the “ Gerontomania " of Anaxandrides, when Rha­ damanthus and Palamedes speak;
and in the opening scene of the " Devotees " [in the recurrence of] the word I.
For if one does not give these passages with declamation, it becomes [a case in point with the pro­ verb] "
Stiff as one carrying a beam."
And so also where connectives are wanting, "I came, I met, I besought him for you needs must give it with de­ clamation, and not, as though simply saying one thing, enunciate it with the same manner and tone.
There is, moreover, a certain peculiarity which omissions of connectives possess;
for it strikes one that, in an equal length of time, many things have been stated ;
for the connective makes many, one ;
so that if it be taken away, it is evident that on the contrary one will be many.
It possesses, then, amplification ;
" I came, I conversed with, I besought," being many,­ " he seems to overlook all I have said, all I now say."
Homer is desirous of producing this effect in the lines:
" Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore, .irem, whom Agläe to Charopus bore, Nireus, in faultless shape1,” etc. POPE.
For of whom a great deal is said, that man must needs be spoken of frequently;
and therefore if one be spoken of frequently, it appears that a great deal has been said of him.
So that the poet mentioning him only once, by help of this sophism amplifies the cha­ racter, and has excited a recollection of him, though he no where subsequently mentions him.
Now the deliberative style is exactly like sketch­ ing;
for in proportion as the crowd is larger, the view is taken from a greater distance ;
on which ac­ count, in the one as well as in the other, productions of an exquisite finish are superfluous, and look worse than others.
But the judicial is a thing of greater nicety:
and in a still higher degree where it is be­ fore a single judge;
for least of all is this within the reach of rhetorical artifice ;
since the peculiar points of the case are more easily concentrated to the view, than what is merely external:
and the heat of dis­ putation is out of the question, so that the decision is fair and clear.
And on this account the same speakers are not approved in all these kinds;
but where there is most of declamation, there least of all is accuracy:
this, however, is the case where power of voice is requisite, and particularly if a consider­ able power.
The demonstrative style, however, is most adapted to writing;
for its purpose is perusal:
second to it [in this adaptation] is the judicial.
But to draw any further distinctions on the sub­ ject of style, that it ought to be pleasing and mag­ nificent, is superfluous:
for why should it be such rather than temperate and liberal, or if there be any other moral virtue?
For that the foregoing rules will cause it to be pleasing is manifest, if indeed ex­ cellence of style has been correctly defined:
—for with a view to what must it be, [according to our definition,] " clear and not mean, but in good taste?"
For should it become prosing, it is no longer clear, neither if it should be too concise.
But it is plain that the mean is appropriate.
And the foregoing precepts will cause its being pleasing, should the ordinary expressions have been judiciously blended with the foreign, and should rhythm [not be want­ ing], and the persuasive influence resulting from good taste.
The subject of style has then been treated2, as well generally, respecting all the species of rhetoric, as particularly, respecting each.
But it yet remains to treat of arrangement.
THE parts of a speech are two;
for it is necessary to state the case about which it is, and to prove it.
Wherefore for one, after stating, not to prove it, or to proceed to prove it without a previous statement, is out of the question:
for whoever proves, proves something;
and he who makes a previous statement, makes such statement with a view to subsequently proving it.
And of these parts, the one is the state- ment, the other the proof;
just as though one were to make a division into problem and demonstration.
But the divisions which they now usually make are ridiculous;
for narration is a kind of peculiarity to judicial speeches alone;
for how can there, in de­ monstrative and deliberative speeches, be any narra­ tion such as they speak of, or any reply, confutation of an adversary, or any peroration of points selected for display of character ?
But exordium, contrast of argument, and recapi­ tulation 2, do then only occur in deliberative speeches when an altercation happens ;
for, considered as ac­ cusation and defence, they frequently [admit these branches but not in their character of a piece of advice.
But the peroration, moreover, is not an es­ sential of every judicial;
for instance, if the speech be a short one, or the case easy to be remembered.
For it is usual to detract only from what is prolix.
The necessary divisions, then, are the statement and the proofs.
The essential divisions then are these;
but the greatest number are, exordium, statement, proof, peroration.
The confutation of an adversary belongs to the proof;
and the contrast of arguments is an amplification of one's own, so as to be a kind of branch of the proof;
for one who does this proves something:
but not so either exordium or peroration ;
but [ the latter ] refreshes the recollection.
But should one draw distinctions with regard to these, that will be the case which the followers of Theodorus used to do, there will be a narration dis­ tinct from post-narration, and præ-narration, together with refutation, and post-refutation.
But the writer should affix a title only after marking out a distinct species and difference4, otherwise it becomes mere emptiness and trifling;
just like Licymnius, who in his treatise gives the titles, irruption-digression­ ramifications, etc.
Now the exordium is the commencement of the speech;
which in poetry is the prologue, and in the performances on the pipe, the prelude:
for these are all commencements, and, as it were, an opening of the way for what is to succeed.
The prelude, then, corresponds to the exordium of demonstrative speeches;
for the performers on the pipe, using as a prelude any piece whatever which they are able to execute with skill, connect the whole by an inserted passage:
and so in demonstrative speeches ought we to write;
for the speaker ought, after stating whatever he lists1, straightway to em­ ploy the insertion, and link it [to the body of the speech].
Which indeed all do, having as their model the exordium of the Helen of Isocrates:
for there exists no very near connexion between Helen and the artifices of sophists2.
At the same time, if the exordium be out of the way of the subject, there is this advantage, that the whole speech is not of one uniform character.
But the exordia of demonstrative speeches are derived from praise, or from blame, (like Gorgias in the Olympic oration,—“ Men wor­ thy, 0 Greeks, of admiration among many;
" for he is eulogizing those who instituted the general assem­ blies :
Isocrates, however, blames them, " because they distinguish by prizes the excellencies of person, while for those who are wise they propose no re­ ward ;
") and thirdly, from suggesting advice ;
for in- stance, " -because it is fitting to honour the good," on that account [the orator] himself also speaks the praises of Aristides, or such characters as neither enjoy reputation, nor are worthless, but as many as, though they be excellent persons, are obscure;
just as was Paris, the son of Priam:
for thus the orator conveys advice.
Again [we may borrow demon­ strative exordia] from those proper to judicial rhe­ toric, i. e. from appeals to the auditor, in case the speech be respecting any thing revolting to opinion, or difficult, or already noised abroad among many, so as to obtain his pardon :
as Choerilus begins, " Now after every thing has become public.
"The exordia, then, of demonstrative rhetoric arise from these sources,-from praise, blame, exhortation, dissuasion, and appeals to the hearers.
The inserted connective clauses may be either foreign or appro­ priate to the subject.
With regard to the exordia of judicial rhetoric, we must assume that they are equivalent to the opening scenes of dramas, and the exordia of epic poems ;
for the commencement of dithyrambic poetry resembles demonstrative exordia,—“ on account of thee, thy gifts, thy spoils."
But in the drama, and in epic poetry, the commencement is an intimation of the subject, that the hearer may foresee what the story is about, and that his mind may not be in suspense;
for whatever is indeterminate bewilders us.
He then who puts, as it were, into the hand the beginning of the clue, causes him who holds it to follow on the story.
On this account we have,­ “ Sing, muse, the wrath," etc. " The man, 0 muse, resound," etc. "
This too declare;
from Asia's coasts afar, How upon Europe burst the mighty war."
And the tragedians give some insight into the plot of the drama, if not forthwith, as Euripides does, yet they give it some where at least in the opening scene;
just as also does Sophocles;
—“Polybus was my fa­ ther3!"
And comedy in the same way.
The most necessary business of the exordium, and this is pecu­ liar to it, is to throw some light on the end for the sake of which the speech is made.
For which very reason, if this be evident, and the case a brief one, we need not employ an exordium.
The other species which speakers employ are correctives, and general.
4:
these are, however, deduced from 1. the speaker him­ self ;
2.
his hearer;
3. the subject;
4. and from the adversary.
Every thing whatsoever which refers to the doing away or the casting an aspersion of charac­ ter, has a relation to one's self or the adversary.
But these things are not done exactly in the same way:
for by one speaking on a defence, whatever tends to asper­ sion of character should be put first;
but by one who is laying an accusation, in his peroration.
And the reason why is not indistinct;
for it is necessary that one who is making a defence, when he is about to in­ troduce himself, should sweep away every stumbling­ block ;
so that the prepossession against you must first be removed:
by him, however, who raises the un­ favourable impression, let it be raised in winding up, in order that the judges may the rather recollect it.
The correctives, however, which refer to the hearer, are drawn out of conciliating his good will, and in­ flaming him with anger, and occasionally from attract­ ing his attention, or the reverse ;
for it is not at all times convenient to render him attentive, for which reason many endeavour to induce them to laughter.
But all these will conduce to tractability [on the judge's part], if one wishes it, as does also the showing one's self a person of character;
for to such do people the rather give heed.
But men are attentive to objects of importance, of a peculiar description, or deserving admiration, or pleasing.
Hence we ought to throw in a hint that the speech is concerning subjects of this nature.
But if you would have them not atten­ tive, hint that the matter is trifling, concerns them not, or is disgusting.
But it ought not to escape our observation, that the whole of this is foreign to the subject;
for they are addressed to a hearer of sorry taste, and one who lends an ear to points foreign to the subject;
for if the hearer be not of this character, there is no need of exordium, except so far as to state the matter summarily, that, like a body, it may have a head.
Again, the business of exciting attention is common to all the divisions of a speech, wherever it may be necessary;
for the audience relax their attention any where rather than at the beginning.
For which rea­ son it is ridiculous to range this head at the begin­ ning, when more particularly every one is at the summit of attention.
So that, whenever it is conve­ nient, we may use the formulary, "Lend me your whole attention, for the question does not affect me any more than yourselves;
" and this one,—“ for I will relate to you a thing so strange, so wonderful, as you never yet heard."
But this is just what Pro­ dicus says he used to do,—“ whenever the audience happen to nod, to insert, by the bye, a display of his penteconta-drachmial demonstration 5."
But that these things are referred to the hearer not in his pro­ per capacity as such, is evident;
for all create unfa­ vourable impressions or do them away in their ex­ ordia :
as, " 0 king, I confess indeed, that not with haste," etc.6:
and again, "Why such long preludes7.
”They, too, employ exordia who have, or appear to have, the worse case;
for it is better to pause any where than on the case itself.
On which account servants tell not what is asked them, but all the cir­ cumstances, and make long preambles..
But the means out of which we must conciliate have been stated, and each other point of that na­ ture8:
and, as it is well remarked by the poet, " Grant that I may reach the Phoeacians a friend and object of their compassion;
" we ought, therefore, to aim at these two objects.
And in demonstrative orations, you should cause the hearer to suppose that he is praised simultaneously with the subject, either in his own person or his family, or in his maxims of con­ duct, or at least somehow or other.
For true it is, as Socrates remarks, that To praise Athenians be­ fore an Athenian audience is no difficult thing, how­ ever it may be in the presence of Lacedæmonians9.
”But the exordia of deliberative rhetoric are derived from those of judicial:
but this species has them na­ turally least of all the three;
for indeed the audience are aware of the subject;
and the case needs no ex­ ordium except 1. on account of the speaker himself;
2. or his opponent;
or 3. if the audience conceive of the importance of the matter otherwise than he could wish, thinking it either too serious or too trifling:
with a view to which objects respectively there is a necessity for either exciting or doing away a prejudice, or for amplification or diminution.
On account of these things there is need of exordium ;
4.
or other­ wise for the sake of ornament;
since without it a speech appears hastily got up.
Of this sort was the panegyric of Gorgias on the Eleans ;
for without any thing like the preluding display of gesture and atti­ tude in the Gymnasium, he begins forthwith,—“ 0 Elis, city blest by fortune!"TOUCHING the subject of an imputation cast upon you, one means of removing it will be the recurring to those topics, by means of which one might do away any surmises prejudicial to him;
for it matters not whether they be entertained in consequence of the allegations of any one or not.
So that this topic is universally applicable.
Another mode is, the confronting it like a point under litigation, [arguing] either that it is not the case, or is not hurtful, or not to the particular indi­ vidual ;
or that it is not of such importance, or not unjust, or not considerable, or not disgraceful, or of no consequence;
for in points of this description the question originates:
just as Iphicrates argued against Nausicrates ;
for he pleaded, that he did what the prosecutor alleged, and indeed hurt him, but yet did not act unjustly.
Or confessedly acting unjustly he may offer some equivalent:
e. g. though hurtful, yet was it honourable;
though painful, yet was it bene­ ficial ;
by some other such expedient.
Another method is, the arguing that the action is merely a fault, or an error 1, or that it was necessary;
such as the plea of Socrates, “that he trembled, not as the calumniator alleged, that he might appear an old man, but of necessity;
since his eighty years of age did not overtake him of his own choice."
And you may attempt a commutation of motives;
e. g. " that he did not wish to hurt, but to do this or that, and not what the accuser insinuated;
but that it so happened that hurt was sustained.
But that it were fair enough to hate him, had he acted purposely with a view to this taking placedAnother mode is, the considering whether the prosecutor has either now or formerly, in his own person, or in that of his connexions, been involved in the charge.
Another, whether others, whom they themselves acknowledge not liable to the imputation, be also comprehended;
for instance, if he acknow­ ledge an adulterer to be exempt from the charge, surely then also is this or that person.
Another consists in ascertaining whether he has cast any false imputations on others;
or whether, like the party in the present case, any other has calumniated persons, or whether, without direct imputation, any ever were suspected who have yet appeared innocent.
Another, in raising a counter prejudice against the calumni­ ator ;
for it is absurd, if, while the man is himself void of credit, his words obtain it.
Another, in in­ quiring whether a decision has been already made;
just as Euripides did in reply to Hygiænon, who, in an action of Antidosis, accused him as being an im­ pious person, inasmuch as exhorting to perjury he wrote,—“ The tongue hath sworn, but the mind is unsworn2;
” for Euripides argued, "that by bringing into court the decisions of the Dionysiac contest he acted unjustly;
for there he had given, or would give an account, should he wish to impeach him."
Another, in impeaching calumny itself, as to how great an evil it is;
and this because it produces de­ cisions foreign to the point, and that it relies not on the strength of its case.
But the citing presumptive signs is a topic common to both parties :
thus, in the Teucer, Ulysses insinu­ ates that “ he is of kin to Priam;
for [his mother] Hesione was Priam's sister."
He, however, replies on the ground that, " Telamon, his father, was the enemy of Priam, and that he did not denounce the spies.
"Another, peculiar to an accuser, is, for one after bestowing short praise to censure at great length, putting forward great virtues briefly, or very many [which are not relevant], then to censure in one point which bears home upon the case.
Such me­ thods are the most crafty and malignant;
for they attempt injury by means of one's virtues, by blend­ ing them with a man's failings.
But it is a resource common to the calumniator and one who meets a calumny, that, as it is possible for the same action to have been done from many motives, by the calumniator, indeed, facts should be taken in a bad sense, as he makes his selection of motives on the worse side ;
while by the respondent it should be made on the better.
Take, for instance, the fact that Diomede chose Ulysses:
one will say it was, " because he conceived Ulysses to be the bravest;
" the other, that " it was not, but because he alone could not become a rival, such a poltroon was he.
"Thus much, then, on the subject of imputations.
IN demonstrative speeches the narration is not given in continuity, but in scattered portions ;
for one must go over the actions out of which the speech arises:
for a speech is a kind of compound, having one por­ tion, indeed, independent of art, [since the speaker is not at all the cause of the actions themselves,] and another portion originating in art;
and this last is either the showing that it is fact should it be incredi­ ble, or such either in character or degree, or in show- ing all these points at once.
Owing to this, there are times when one ought not to narrate every fact suc­ cessively ;
because this mode of exposition is difficult to remember.
From some, then, establish the cha­ racter for courage, from others for wisdom, and from others for justice.
The one style of narration is too simple;
the other has the grace of variety, and is not so void of elegance.
But you have only to awaken the recollection of facts well known;
on which ac­ count, many subjects will stand in no need of narra­ tion :
supposing, for instance, you would praise Achilles, because all are acquainted with his actions ;
but you must employ them at once.
But in praising Critias, an orator must narrate;
for not many are acquainted with his exploits.
But now people tell us, ridiculously enough, that the narration should be rapid.
And yet I would say, as did one to a baker, who inquired whether he should knead his bread hard or soft," — it What," said he, " is it then impossible to knead it properly?"
And so here [in rhetoric a mean is to be observed].
for one should not narrate at too great length, just as he should not make too long an exordium, nor state his proofs [too fully].
For neither in this case does propriety consist either in rapidity or concise­ ness, but in a mean betwixt both:
and this is the stating just so much as will make the matter clear, or as will cause one to conceive that it has taken place, or that the party has inflicted hurt, or com­ mitted injustice, or that the case is of that importance which the speaker wishes to establish;
and to the opposite party the opposite points will avail.
And an orator should narrate, by the bye, such incidents as conduce to his own excellence:
thus, " I all along used to instruct them in what was just, bidding them not to abandon their children,”—or, to the villany of the other party ;
- " -but he replied to me, that wherever he might be he should have other children."
Which, Herodotus says, was the reply of the Egyp­ tians on their revolting 1.
Or whatever is pleasing to the judges.
In the case of a defendant, the matter will be more brief;
the points for dispute being, either that it has not taken place, or is not hurtful, or not unjust, or not of such importance.
So that on acknowledged points he need not pause, unless they conduce in some degree to the objects suggested;
e. g. if the fact be acknowledged, but its injustice disputed.
Moreover, you should mention as already done those things which, in the course of being done, failed of producing pity or horror.
The story of Alcinous is an instance, which is despatched to Penelope in-­ sixty verses.
And as Phäyllus does in the circle, and the opening scene of the CEneus.
The narra- tion should also convey a notion of the character:
this will be secured, if we know what gives rise to the moral character.
One source is the manifesta­ tion of deliberate choice ;
and of what kind is moral character we ascertain from knowing of what kind this is;
and of what kind the deliberate choice is, from being acquainted with its proposed end.
Hence the doctrines of mathematics have no display of cba­ racter, for neither have they deliberate choice ;
and this for that they have not the influence of motive2:
but the Socratic discourses [have this display], for they treat concerning subjects of this kind.
But those things convey a notion of character, which is consequent upon the several characters3;
e. g. "
Whilst saying this he began to hasten off;
” for this manifests a hardihood and rusticity of character.
And be cautious not to speak coldly as from the un­ derstanding merely, as orators do now-a-days, but as though from the deliberate choice4. "
I, for I wished and deliberately preferred this ;
and if I pro­ fit nothing by it, then it is the more honourable for the one is characteristic of a prudent5, the other of a good man :
since [the proposed end] of the pru­ dent consists in pursuing the expedient;
of a good man, in pursuing what is honourable.
And should any circumstance be incredible, you must subjoin the reason;
as Sophocles does.
He furnishes an exam­ ple in the Antigone, that she mourned more for her brother than for a husband or children;
for these, if lost, might again be hers. "
But father now and mother both being lost, A brother’s name can ne'er be hail'd again6.”
But if you should have no reason to offer, then avow " that you are well aware that you speak what ex­ ceeds belief, but that such is your nature:
” for the world discredit a man's doing any thing voluntarily, except what is expedient.
Again, draw your remarks out of those things which are indicative of the passions ;
narrating both their attendant circumstances, and those which the audience know, and which attach peculiarly either to the speaker himself or his adversary:
—“ He, having scowled at me, departed."
And as Æschines said of Cratylus, “ that whistling and snapping his fin­ gers—:
” for they have a tendency to persuade:
therefore these things which they know, become indices of that which they do not know.
Such in­ stances one may get in abundance out of Homer:
— " Thus Penelope spoke, and the old woman covered her face with her hands7:
” for those who are begin­ ning to shed tears cover their eyes.
And forthwith insinuate yourself as a person of a certain character, in order that they may look upon you as one of such a description, and your adversary [as the re­ verse] :
but beware of observation as you do it.
And that it is easy to effect this we may observe in those who report any thing to us ;
for respecting the com­ munication (of which as yet we know nothing), we still catch a kind of guess8.
But the narration must be carried on in different parts, and, in some in­ stances, even at the commencement.
But in deliberative speeches narration occurs least of all, because no one narrates respecting what is yet to be:
if, however, there should be any narration, it will be respecting things which have already happen­ ed, that the recollection of them having been awak­ ened, the judges may determine better on the future;
the orator either reprehending or praising them :
but he is not then performing the functions proper to him as an adviser.
If, however, the thing narrated be incredible, see you promise to state a reason for it immediately9, and to submit it to whom they please:
like the Jocasta of Carcinus in his CEdipus, who al­ ways keeps promising when he who was seeking out her son inquires of her:
and the Hæmon of So­ phocles 10.
PROOF should be demonstrative;
and the points of dispute being four, you must demonstrate by pro­ ducing proof respecting the particular point at issue:
thus, if the adversary question the fact, you must at the trial produce proof of this point above the rest;
should it be that he did no harm, then of that point;
and so should he urge that the action is not of the importance supposed, or that it was done justly:
[and it must be done in the latter cases] exactly in the same way as if the inquiry were respecting the mat- ter of fact.
And let it not escape us that in this sin- gle inquiry, it must needs be that one party is guilty1:
for it is not ignorance which is to blame, as though any were to dispute on a point of justice.
So that, in this inquiry, the circumstance should be employed ;
but not in the other [three].
But, in demonstrative rhetoric, amplification, for the most part, will constitute the proof, because the facts are honourable and useful;
for the actions should be taken on credit2, since, even on these sub­ jects, a speaker on very rare occasions does adduce proof, if either the action be passing belief, or if an­ other have the credit of it3.
But, in deliberative speeches, the orator may either contend that the circumstances will not take place, or that what he directs will indeed take place, but that it is not just, or not beneficial, or not in such a degree.
And it will be well for him to observe whether any falsehood appears in the extraneous observations of his adversary ;
for these appear as so many con­ vincing proofs, that he is false in the case of the other more important statements.
And example is best adapted to deliberative rhe- toric;
while enthymem is more peculiar to judicial4.
For the former is relative to the future;
so that out of what has been heretofore, we needs must adduce examples:
the latter respects what is or is not mat­ ter of fact, to which belong more especially demon­ stration and necessity;
for the circumstances of the past involve a necessity.
The speaker ought not, however, to bring forward his enthymems in a con­ tinued series, but to blend them by the way;
should he not do this, they prove an injury one to the other, for there is some limit on the score of quantity too :
­ "
Oh friend, since you have spoken just so much as a prudent man would5;
" but the poet does not say, of such a quality.
Neither should you seek after en­ thymems on every subject;
otherwise you will be doing the very thing which some philosophers do, who infer syllogistically conclusions in themselves better known, and more readily commanding belief, than the premises out of which they deduce them.
And when you would excite any passion, do not em­ ploy an enthymem;
for either it will expel the pas­ sion, or the enthymem will be uttered to no purpose;
for the emotions which happen at the same time expel each other, and either cancel or render one or the other feeble.
Neither when one aims at speaking with the effect of character, ought he at all to aim at the same time at enthymem;
for demonstration possesses neither an air of character, nor deliberate choice.
But a speaker should employ maxims alike in narration and in proof;
for it has an expression of character:
—“ Yes;
I delivered it, even knowing that one ought never to repose implicit confidence.”
And if one speak with a view to excite passion:
­ "
And injured though I be, yet I do not repent;
for the gain, indeed, is on his side, but justice on mine.
"And deliberative is more difficult than judicial rhetoric, and probably enough,—because it respects the future;
whereas, in the latter, the question is respecting the past, which has already become matter of absolute science, even to diviners, as Epimenides the Cretan used to say;
for he did not exercise his art of divination respecting things yet to be, but respecting those which had already happened indeed, but which were obscure:
again, in judicial questions, there is the law as the basis of reasonings ;
but for one who has something wherewith to begin, it is easier to discover means of proof.
Neither has [de­ liberative rhetoric] many opportunities of digression;
none, for instance, in reference to an adversary, or respecting one's self, or in order to excite passion6;
but it possesses these opportunities least of all the three branches, unless it depart from its proper pro­ vince.
If, then, you are at a loss, you should do what the rhetoricians at Athens do, and particularly Isocrates;
for in the course of deliberative speaking he accuses the Lacedæmonians, for instance, in the panegyric, and Chares in the speech about the alli­ ance.
But in demonstrative speaking, you should insert praise in the speech by way of episode, as Iso­ crates does, for he all along keeps introducing some­ thing.
And that saying of Gorgias, " That he never failed of something to say," is nothing more nor less than this:
for if he be speaking of Achilles, he praises Peleus, then Æacus, then his goddess mother, and so, too, valour in the abstract;
or he does some­ thing or another in this strain.
Now the language of one who possesses proof, should be both traught with the impress ot charac­ ter, and fitted to convey the proof.
But if you pos­ sess not enthymems, let it convey an impression of your character;
and the show of goodness more befits a virtuous man, than accuracy of speech.
But of enthymems the refutative are more ap­ proved than the confirmative7:
because in the case of as many as produce reductio ad absurdum, it is more plain that a conclusion has really been arrived at;
for opposites, when set by each other, are more clearly recognised.
Touching reasonings directed against the adver­ sary, they are not in any thing different in species ;
but it belongs to the province of proof to do away his arguments, some by starting an objection, others by contrary inference8.
And the speaker who be­ gins, ought, both in deliberative and judicial rhetoric, first to state his own proofs;
and subsequently to meet objections by doing them away, or by treating them with contempt beforehand.
But should the points objected to be many, first he must confront the objec­ tions, as did Callistratus in the Messeniac assembly;
for previously having swept away what his adver­ saries would be likely to allege in this way, he then spoke on his own part.
But the last speaker should speak first what makes against the adversary's speech, doing it away, and drawing opposite inferences ;
and particularly should his arguments have been well received.
For just as one's mind does not cordially receive a person on whom a slur has been previously cast;
in the same way neither does it favourably listen to a speech, if the opposite speaker appear to have spoken truly.
It is necessary, then, to gain a footing in the hearer's mind for the intended speech;
and it will be gained if you sweep away objections:
where­ fore a speaker, having combated either all, or the most important, or the most approved arguments of his adversary, or those which readily admit a con­ trary inference, is in this way to substantiate his own case:
­ " The fame o* th' Goddesses I '11 first defend,­ ******* For Juno and 9.” In this she first lays hold of the most silly point.-
Thus much, then, of proof.
But as to the effect of character, since the saying some things respecting one's self, either is invidious, or involves prolixity, or a liability to contradiction;
and respecting another, either slander or rusticity;
­ it behoves one to introduce another as speaking:
the thing which Isocrates does in the speech respecting Philip, and in the Antidosis;
and as Archilochus conveys reproof, for he introduces the father saying, in an iambic line respecting his daughter, " There is not any thing which may not be expected, nothing which may be affirmed impossible on oath;
" and Charon, the mechanic, in that iambic whose begin­ ning is, " I regard not the wealth of Gyges;
" and as Sophocles introduces Hæmon pleading in behalf of Antigone to his father, as though another character were speaking.
But it is necessary sometimes to alter the form of our epthymems, and to make them into maxims10:
for example, " It behoves men of sense to come to reconciliation while yet successful;
for thus will they be the greatest gainers."
But, in enthymematic form, it is thus:
" If persons ought then to be recon­ ciled when the reconciliation will be most to their advantage and profit, they should be reconciled while yet they are successful."
BUT respecting interrogation, it is the happiest time for employing it when an admission has been made in such a way, that a single further question being put, an absurdity occurs:
thus Pericles asked Lam­ pon respecting the initiation to the rites of [Ceres] the protectress ;
and on his saying, " That it was not possible for him, an uninitiated person, to hear it," -he asked Whether he knew himself ?
”when he said he did, [Pericles subjoined,] “ And how do you know who are uninitiated ?
"Next to this is the crisis, when [of two points one is clear, and it is manifest to the party putting the question, that his adversary will concede the other;
for one ought, after having ascertained by inquiry the one proposition, not to interrogate fur­ ther respecting the point which is clear, but state the conclusion.
Just as Socrates, when Meletus denied that he believed in the gods, asked "
Whether he asserted the being of any demon ? "
When he al­ lowed that he had, Socrates asked, " Whether these demons were not either sons of the gods, or some­ thing of divine nature?"
And when he allowed it, " Is there, then," said he, " one who thinks that sons of the gods exist, and not the gods themselves ?
"Again, when one is likely to exhibit the adversary as speaking contradictions, or somewhat revolting to general opinion.
Fourthly, when he may not be able to rid himself of the question otherwise than by a sophistical an­ swer :
for if he answer in this way, that it is, and is not, or partly is, and partly is not,—or, one way it is, another way is not;
the hearers hoot him off, be­ ing at a loss for his meaning.
Under any other circumstances do not attempt in­ terrogation ;
for should the party interrogated start an objection to the question, you appear to have been overcome :
since it is not possible to put many questions by reason of the imbecility of the hearer.
On which account we ought, as much as possible, to compress even our enthymems.
But one must give his answers to equivocal ques­ tions with a distinction 1, and not concisely;
and to what seems a contradiction, by directly offering an explanation in the reply, before the interrogator can put the next succeeding question, or draw the in­ ference he aims at;
for it is no difficult thing to foresee on what the speech turns.
Be this, however, and the means of answering, clear to us from the Topics.
And as to a party drawing his conclusion, it his question produce that conclusion, you are to assign the cause :
as Sophocles, when questioned by Pisander, "Whether it had been his opinion, as it had of the other commissioners, to establish the four hundred," acknowledged that it had.
—
“But how," rejoined the other, " seemed it not to you to be wrong ?"
He said it did. "
Did you not, then, do that which was wrong?"
“Yes, forsooth," replied he, " for I had no better alternative."
And as the Lacedæmonian, when called to an account respecting his ephorship, on having the question put, " Whether the rest appeared to him to have perished justly," said they did. "
Then," retorted the other, " did you not enact the same things as they ? "
And when he acknowledged that he had, " Would not you also," asked the other, "justly perish?" "No, indeed," said he, " for they did this on a bribe;
I did not, but merely from judgment."
Wherefore one ought not after the conclusion to put a further question, nor to put, interrogatively, the conclusion itself, unless the truth lies abundantly on our side.
But with respect to Ridicule, inasmuch as it seems to possess a kind of use in disputation2, and as " one ought," says Gorgias, " to mar the grave earnestness of our adversary by ridicule, and his ridicule by sober earnestness," making the remark justly enough,-it has been stated in the Poetic how many species of ridicule there are;
whereof, some befit the gentle­ man, others do not:
so that each must see to it that he take that which befits himself.
But the playing a man off is more gentlemanly than buffoonery;
for the former produces the ridicule for his own sake, the buffoon for that of another.
THE peroration is composed of four things:
---of get­ ting the hearer favourable to one's self, and ill-dis­ posed towards the adversary;
and of amplification and extenuation ;
and of placing the hearer under the influence of the passions;
and of awakening his re­ collection.
For after showing yourself to be on the right side, and your adversary on the wrong, it naturally follows to praise and blame, and to give the last finish.
And one of two things the speaker ought to aim at, either to show that he is good relatively to them, [the audi­ ence,] or is so absolutely;
and that the other party is bad, either relatively to them, or absolutely.
And the elements, out of which one ought to get up per­ sons as of such characters, have been stated;
both whence one should establish them as bad, and whence as good.
Next to this, these points having been already shown, it follows naturally to amplify or diminish:
for the facts must needs be acknowledged, if one be about to state their quantity;
for the in­ crease of bodies is from substances previously exist­ ing.
But the elements, out of which one must amplify and diminish, are above set forth.
Next to this, the facts being clear both as to their nature and degree, it follows that we excite the hearer to passion;
such as are, pity, terror, anger, hatred, envy, emulation, and contentiousness:
the elements of these also have been stated above.
So that it merely remains to awaken a recollection of what has been before stated.
And this we are to do here, in the way in which some erroneous teach­ ers say we should in the exordium:
for in order that the facts may be readily perceived, they bid us state them frequently.
Now there [in the exordium] in­ deed we ought to state the case at full, in order that it may not be unknown to the hearer upon what the trial turns;
here, however, [in the peroration,] merely the means by which it has been proved, and that summarily.
The commencement of the peroration will be, that one has made good what he undertook;
so that it will be to be stated, as well what one has adduced, as for what reasons.
And it is expressed either by means of a juxtaposition with the adversary's statements;
and draw the comparison either between every point whatsoever, which both have stated relative to the same thing;
or else not by a direct opposition. "
He, indeed, on this subject said so and so ;
but I so and so, and for such reasons."
Or, by a kind of banter­ ing:
thus, "He said so and so, and I so and so."
And, " What would he do, had he proved this, and not the other point !”
Or by interrogation :
-"
What has not been fully proved on my side ?" or, "
What has this man established ?
”
Either in this way, then, must the speaker conclude, or he must, in natural order, so state his reasoning as it was origin­ ally stated;
and, again, if he pleases, he may state distinctly that of the adversary's speech.
And, for the close, the style without connectives is becoming, in order that it maybe a peroration, not an oration 1:
I have spoken,—you have heard,-the case is in your hands,-pronounce your decision 2.
WE see that all men naturally are able in some sort to accuse and excuse:
some by chance;
but some by method, This method may be discovered :
and to discover Method is all one with teaching an Art.
If this Art consisted in Criminations only, and the skill to stir up the Judges, Anger, Envy, Fear, Pity, or other affections;
a Rhetorician in well ordered Com­ monwealths and States, where it is forbidden to digress from the cause in hearing, could have nothing at all to say.
For all these perversions of the Judge are beside the question.
And that which the pleader is to shew, and the Judge to give sentence on, is this only:
' Tis so:
or not so.
The rest hath been decided already by the Law-maker;
who judging of uni­ versals, and future things, could not be corrupted.
Besides, 'tis an absurd thing, for a man to make crooked the Ruler he means to use.
It consisteth therefore chiefly in Proofs;
which are Infer­ ences :
and all Inferences being Syllogismes, a Logician, if he would observe the difference between a plain Syllogisme, and an Enthymeme, (which is a RhetoricaU Syllogisme,) would make the best Rhetorician.
For all Syllogismes and Inferences belong properly to Logick;
whether they infer truth or pro­ bability :
and because without this Art it would often come to pass, that evil men by the advantage of natural abilities, would carry an evil cause against a good ;
it brings with it at least this profit, that making the pleaders even in skill, it leaves the odds only in the merit of the cause.
Besides, ordinarily those that are Judges, are neither patient, nor capable of long Scientifical proofs, drawn from the principles through many Syllogismes;
and therefore had need to be instructed by the Rhetoricall, and shorter way.
Lastly, it were ridiculous, to be ashamed of being vanquished in exercises of the body, and not to be ashamed of being inferior in the vertue of well ex­ pressing the mind.
RHETORICK, is that Faculty,•by which we understand what will serve our turn, concerning any Subject to win belief in the hearer.
Of those things that beget belief;
some require not the help of Art;
as Witnesses, Evidences, and the like, which we in­ vent not, but make use of;
and some require Art, and are in­ vented by us.
The belief that proceeds from our Invention, comes partly from the behaviour of the speaker;
partly from the passions of the hearer:
but especially from the proofs of what we alledge.
Proofs are, in Rhetorick, either Examples, or Enthymemes, as in Logick, Inductions, or Syllogismes.
For an Example is a short Induction, and an Enthymeme a short Syllogisme;
out of which are left as superfluous, that which is supposed to be necessarily understood by the hearer;
to avoid pro­ lixity, and not to consume the time of publick business need­ lessly 1.IN all Orations, the Hearer does either hear only;
or judge also.
If he hear only, that's one kind of Oration, and is called De­ monstrative.
If he judge, he must judge either of that which is to come;
or of that which is past.
If of that which is to come, there's another kind of Oration, and is called Deliberative.
If of that which is past;
then His a third kind of Oration, called Judicial.
So there are three kinds of Orations;
Demonstrative, Ju­ dicial, Deliberative.
To which belong their proper times.
To the Demonstra­ tive, the Present;
To the Judicial, the Past;
and to the De­ liberative, the time to come.
And their proper Offices.
To the Deliberative, Exhorta­ tion and Dehortation.
To the Judicial, Accusation and De­ fence.
And to the Demonstrative, Praising and Dispraising.
And their proper ends.
To the Deliberative, to Prove a thing Profitable, or Unprofitable.
To the Judicial, Just, or Un­ just.
To the Demonstrative, Honourable, or Dishonourable.
The Principles of Rhetorick out of which Enthymemes are to be drawn;
are the common Opinions that men have con­ cerning Profitable, and Unprofitable;
Just, and Unjust;
Honourable, and Dishonourable;
which are the points in the several kinds of Orations questionable.
For as in Logick, where certain and infallible knowledge is the scope of our proof, the Principles must be all infallible Truths:
so in RhetoricA the Principles must be common Opinions, such as the Judge is already possessed with :
because the end of RhetoricA is vic­ tory ;
which consists in having gotten Belief.
And because nothing is Profitable, Unprofitable, Just, Un­ just, Honourable, or Dishonourable, but what has been done, or is to be done;
and nothing is to be done, that is not possible:
and because there be degrees of Profitable, Unprofitable, Just, Unjust, Honourable, and Dishonourable;
an Orator must be ready in other Principles;
namely, of what is done and not done;
possible and not possible ;
to come and not to come;
and what is Greater, and what is Lesser;
both in general, and particularly applyed to the thing in question ;
as what is more and less, generally ;
and what is more profitable, and less pro­ fitable, etc.
particularly.
IN
Deliberatives there are to be considered the Subject, where­ in, and the Ends whereto the Orator exhorteth, or from which he dehorteth.
The Subject is always something in our own power, the knowledge whereof belongs not to Rhetorick, but for the most part to the Politicks;
and may be referred in a manner to these five heads.
1.
Of levying of Money.
To which point he that will speak as he ought to do, ought to know before-hand, the revenue of the State, how much it is, and wherein it consisteth ;
and also how great are the necessary charges and expences of the same.
This knowledge is gotten partly by a man's own experience, partly by relations, and accounts in writing.
2.
Of Peace and War.
Concerning which the Counsellor or Deliberator, ought to know the strength of the Common­ wealth ;
how much it both now is, and hereafter may be:
and wherein that power consisteth.
Which knowledge is gotten, partly by experience, and relations at home;
and partly by the sight of wars, and of their events abroad.
3.
Of the Safeguard of the Country.
Wherein he only is able to give counsell, that knows the forms, and number, and places of the Garrisons.
4.
Of Provision.
Wherein to speak well, it is necessary for a man to know what is sufficient to maintain the State;
what Commodities they have at home growing;
what they must fetch in through need;
and what they may carry out through abundance.
5.
Of making Laws.
To which is necessary so much Po­ litical, or Civil Philosophy, as to know what are the several kinds of Governments ;
and by what means, either from with- out or from within, each of those kinds is preserved, or de­ stroyed.
And this knowledge is gotten, partly by observing the several Governments in times past, by History;
and part­ ly by observing the Government of the times present in se­ veral Nations, by Travel.
So that to him that will speak in a Councell of State, there is necessary this;
History, Sight of Wars, Travel, Know­ ledge of the Revenue, Expences, Forces, Havens, Garrisons, Wares, and Provisions in the State he lives in;
and what is needful for that State, either to export or import.
AN Orator in Exhorting always propoundeth Felicity, or some part of Felicity to be attained by the actions he exhorteth unto:
and in Dehortation the contrary.
By Felicity, is meant commonly, Prosperity with vertue, or a continual content of the life with surety.
And the parts of it are such things as we call good, in body, mind, or fortune ;
such as these that follow.
1.
Nobility.
Which to a State or Nation is, to have been antient inhabitants ;
and to have had most antiently, and in most number, famous Generals in the Wars, or men famous for such things as fall under emulation.
And to a private man, to have been descended lawfully of a Family, which hath yielded most antiently, and in most number, men known to the World for vertue, riches, or any thing in general estimation.
2.
Many and good Children.
Which is also publick and private.
PublicA, when there is much youth in the State en­ dued with vertue, (namely, of the body, stature, beauty, strength, and dexterity:
Of the mind, valour, and temperance).
Pri­ vate, when a man hath many such Children, both Male and Female.
The vertues commonly respected in Women, are of the body, Beauty, and Stature;
Of the mind, Temperance, and Houswifery, without Sordidness.3.
Riches.
Which is, Money, Cattel, Lands, Houshold­ stuffe ;
with the power to dispose of them.
4. Glory.
Which is, the reputation of Vertue, or of the possession of such things as all, or most men, or wise men desire.
5.
Honour.
Which is, the glory of benefiting, or being able to benefit others.
To benefit others, is to contribute somewhat, not easily had, to another man’s safety, or riches.
The parts of Honour are, Sacrifices, Monuments, Rewards, Dedication of places, Precedence, Sepulchres, Statues, publick Pensions, Adorations, Presents.
6.
Health.
Which is the being free from Diseases, with strength to use the body.
7.
Beauty.
Which is to different Ages different.
To Youth, strength of body, and sweetness of aspect.
To Full .,fen, strength of body fit for the Wars, and Countenance sweet, with a mixture of Terror.
To Old Men, strength enough for necessary labours, with a Countenance not displeasing.
8.
Strength.
Which is the ability to move any thing at pleasure of the Mover.
To move, is to pull, to put off, to lift, to thrust down, to press together.
9.
Stature.
Which is then just, when a man in height, breadth, and thickness of body dotA so exceed the most, as ne­ vertheless it be no hindrance to the quickness of his motion.
10.
Good old Age.
Which is, that which comes late, and with the least trouble.
11. Many and good Friends.
Which is, to have many that will do for his sake that which they think will be for his good.
12. Prosperity.
Which is, to have all, or the most, or the greatest of those goods which we attribute to Fortune.
13. Vertue.
Which is then to be defined, when we speak of Praise.
These are the grounds from whence we exhort.
Dehortation is from the contraries of these.
IN Deliberatives, the Principles, or Elements from whence we draw our Proofs, are common Opinions concerning Good and Evil.
And these Principles are either Absolute, or Com­ parative.
And those that are Absolute, are either Disputable, or Indisputable.
The Indisputable Principles are such as these :
Good, is that which we love for it self.
And that, for which we love somewhat else.
And that which all things desire.
And that to every man which his reason dictates.
And that, which when we have, we are well, or satisfied.
And that which satisfies.
And the Cause or Effect of any of these.
And that which preserves any of these.
And that which keeps off, or destroys the contrary of any of these.
Also to take the Good, and reject the Evil, is Good.
And to take the greater Good, rather than the less;
and the lesser Evil, rather than the greater.
Further, all Vertues are Good.
And Pleasure.
And all things Beautiful.
And Justice, Valour, Temperance, Magnanimity, Magnifi­ cence;
and other like Habits.
And Health, Beauty, Strength, etc.And Riches.
And Friends.
And Honour, and Glory.
And Ability to say or do ;
also Towardliness, Will, and the like.
And whatsoever Art, or Science.
And Life.
And whatsoever is Just.
The Disputable Principles are such as follow:
That is Good, whose contrary is Evil.
And whose contrary is Good for our Enemies.
And whose contrary our Enemies are glad of.
And of which there cannot be too much.
And upon which much labour and cost hath been bestowed.
And that which many desire.
And that which is praised.
And that which even our Enemies and evil men praise.
And what good we prefer.
And what we do advise.
And that which is possible, is Good (to undertake).
And that which is easie.
And that which depends on our own Will.
And that which is proper for us to do.
And what no man else can do.
And whatsoever is Extraordinary.
And what is suitable.
And that which wants a little of being at an end.
And what we hope to master.
And what we are fit for.
And what evil men do not.
And what we love to do.
THE Colours of Good comparatively depend partly upon the following Definitions of Comparatives.1.
More, is so much, and somewhat besides.
2. Less, is that, which and somewhat else is so much.
3. Greater and more in number are laid only Comparatively to Less, and Fewer in number.
4.
Great and Little, Many and Few, are taken Compara­ tively to the Most of the same kind.
So that Great and Many, is that which exceeds;
Little and Few, is that which is ex ceeded by the Most of the same kind.
Partly from the precedent Definitions of Good absolutely.
Greater Good is Many, than fewer, or one of those many.
And Greater is the kind, in which the greatest is greater than the greatest of another kind.
And greater is that Good than another good, whose kind is greater than another's kind.
And Greater is that from which another Good follows;
than the Good which follows.
And of two which exceed a third, Greater is that which exceeds it most.
And that which causes the greater Good.
And that which proceeds from a greater Good.
And Greater is that which is chosen for it self, than that which is chosen from somewhat else.
And the end Greater than that which is not the end.
And that which less needs other things, than that which more.
And that which is independent, than that which is depend­ ent of another.
And the Beginning, than not the Beginning.
[Seeing the Beginning is a greater Good, or Evil, than that which is not the Beginning;
and the End, than that which is not the End;
One may argue from this Colour both ways:
as Leodamas against Chabrias, would have the Actor more to blame than the Advisor;
and against Callistratus, the Advisor more than the Actor.
And the Cause, than not the Cause.
And that which hath a greater Beginning or Cause.
And the Beginning, or Cause of a greater Good or Evil.
And that which is Scarce, greater than that which is Plen­ tiful ;
because harder to get.
And that which is Plentiful, than that which is Scarce;
because oftener in Use.
And that which is easie, than that which is hard.
And that whose Contrary is greater.
And that whose Want is greater.
And Vertue than not Vertue, a greater Good.
Vice, than not Vice, a greater Evil.
And greater Good, or Evil is that, the effects whereof are more Honourable or more Shameful.
And the effects of greater Vertues, or Vices.
And the Excess whereof is more tolerabl , a greater Good.
And those things which may with more honour be desired.
And the desire of better things.
And those things whereof the Knowledge is better.
And the Knowledge of better things.
And that which wise men prefer.
And that which is in better men.
And that which better men chuse.
And that which is more, than that which is less delightful.
And that which is more, than that which is less honourable.
And that which we would have for our selves and Friends, a greater Good;
and the contrary a greater Evil.
And that which is Lasting, than that which is not Lasting.
And that which is Firm, than that which is not Firm.
And what many desire, than what few.
And what the Adversary, or Judge confesseth to be greater.
is greater.
And Common than not Common.
And not Common than Common.
And what is more Laudable.
And that which is more Honoured, a greater Good.
And that which is more Punished, a greater Evil.
And both Good and Evil divided than undivided, appear greater.
And Compounded than Simple, appear greater.
And that which is done with Opportunity, Age, Place, Time, Means disadvantagious, greater than otherwise.
And that which is natural, than that which is attained unto.
And the same part of that which is great, than of that which is less.
And that which is nearest to the end designed.
And that which is Good or Evil to ones self, than that which is simply so.
And possible, than not possible.
And that which comes toward the end of our Life.
And that which we do really, than that which we do for show.
And that which we would be, rather than what we would seem to be.
And that which is good for more purposes, is the greater Good.
And that which serves us in great necessity.
And that which is joyned with less trouble.
And that which is joyned with more delight.
And of the two, that which added to a third, makes the whole the greater.
,And that which having, we are more sensible of.
And in every thing, that which we most esteem.
BECAUSE Hortation and Dehortation concern the Common­ wealth, and are drawn from the Elements of Good and Evil;
as we have spoken of them already in the Abstract, so we must speak of them also in the Concrete;
that is, of what is Good or Evil to each sort of Commonwealth in special.
The Government of a Commonwealth, is either Democracy, or Aristocracy, or Oligarchy, or Monarchy.
Democracy is that, wherein all men with equal right, are preferred to the highest Magistracy by Lot.
Aristocracy is that, wherein the highest Magistrate is chosen out of those, that had the best education, according to what the Laws prescribe for best.
Oligarchy is that, where the highest Magistrate is chosen for wealth.
Monarchy is that, wherein one man hath the Government of all;
which Government, if he limit by Law, is called King­ dom;
if by his own will, Tyranny.
The end of Democracy, or the Peoples Government, is Liberty.
The end of Oligarchy, is the riches of those that govern.
The end of Aristocracy is good Laws, and good ordering of the City.
The end of Monarchy, or Kings, is the safety of the People, and conservation of his own Authority.
Good therefore, in each sort of Government is that which conduceth to these their ends.
And because belief is not gotten only by proofs, but also from manners;
the manners of each sort of Commonwealth ought to be well understood by him that undertaketh to per­ swade or diswade in matter of State.
Their manners may be known by their designs;
and their designs by their ends;
and their ends by what we see them take pleasure in.
But of this more accurately in the Politicks.
IN a Demonstrative Oration, the subject whereof is Praise, or Dispraise;
the proofs are to be drawn from the Elements of Honourable and Dishonourable.
In this place we anticipate the second way of getting be­ lief;
which is from the manners of the Speaker.
For Praise, whether it come in as the principal business, or upon the by, depends still upon the same Principles.
Which are these :
Honourable, is that, which we love for itself, and is withal laudable.
And that Good, which pleaseth us only because 'tis Good.
And Vertue.
Vertue is the faculty of getting and preserving that which is Good;
and the faculty of doing many, and great things well.
The kinds of it are these;
1. Justice;
which is a Vertue whereby every man obtains what by Law is his.
2.
Fortitude;
which is a Vertue by which a man carries himself Honourably, and according to the Laws, in time of danger.
3.
Temperance;
which is a Vertue whereby a man Governs himself in matter of pleasure according to the Law.4.
Liberality;
which is a Vertue, by which we benefit others in matter of money.
5.
Magnanimity;
which is a Vertue, by which a man is apt to do great benefits.
6.
Magnificence ;
which is a Vertue, by which a man is apt to be at great cost.
7. Prudence;
which is an Intellectual Vertue, by which a man is able to deliberate well concerning any Good leading to Felicity.
And Honourable, are the Causes, and effects of things Honourable.
And the Works of Vertue.
And the signs of Vertue.
And those actions, the reward whereof is Honour.
And the reward whereof is rather Honour, than Money.
And that which we do not for our own sakes.
And what we do for our Countries good, neglecting our own.
And those things are Honourable, which good of them­ selves, are not so to the Owner.
And those things which happen to the dead, rather than to the living.
And what we do for other men, especially for Benefactors.
And bestowing of Benefits.
And the contrary of those things we are ashamed of.
And those things which men strive for earnestly, but with­ out fear of Adversary.
And of the more Honourable and better men, the Vertues are more Honourable.
And more Honourable are the vertues that tend to other mens benefit, than those which tend to ones own.
And Honourable are those things which are Just.
And Revenge is Honourable.
And Victory.And Honour.
And Monuments.
And those things which happen not to the living.
And things that excel.
And what none can do but we.
And possessions we reap no profit by.
And those things which are had in honour particularly in several places.
And the signs of praise.
And to have nothing of the servile, mercenary, or mechanick.
And that which seems Honourable ;
Namely such as follow.
Vices confining upon Vertue.
And the extreams of Vertues.
And what the Auditors think Honourable.
And that which is in estimation.
And that which is done according to custom.
Besides, in a Demonstrative Oration, the Orator must shew, that he whom he praiseth, did what he praiseth unconstrain­ edly, and willingly.
And he does so, who does the same often.
Praise, is speech, declaring the magnitude of a VertuM, Action, or Work.
But to praise the Work from the Vertue of the Worker, is a circular proof.
To Magnify and to Praise, differ in themselves, as Felicity and Vertue.
For Praise declares a mans Vertue ;
and Mag­ nifying declares his Felicity.
Praise is a kind of inverted Precept.
For to say, Do it be­ cause 'tis good, is a Precept.
But to say, He is good because he did it, is Praise.
An Orator in Praising must also use the forms of Amplifi­ cation;
such as these :
He was the first that did it.
The only man that did it.
The special man that did it.
He did it with disadvantage of time.
He did it with little help.
He was the cause, that the Law ordained Rewards and Honours for such Actions.
Further, he that will praise a Man, must compare him with others;
and his actions with the actions of others;
especially with such as are renowned.
And Amplification is more proper to a Demonstrative Ora­ tion, than to any other.
For here the Actions are confessed;
and the Orators part is only this, to contribute unto them Magnitude and Luster.
IN a Judicial Oration, which consists in Accusation and De­ fence, the thing to be proved is, that Injury has been done:
and the heads from whence the proofs are to be drawn, are these three:
I.
The causes that move to Injury.2.
The Persons apt to do Injury.3.
The Persons obnoxious, or apt to suffer Injury.
An Injury is a voluntary offending of another man contra­ ry to the Law.
Voluntary is that which a man does with knowledge, and without compulsion.
The causes of Voluntary Actions are Intemperance, and a Vicious disposition concerning things Desirable.
As the Co­ vetous man does against the Law, out of an intemperate desire of Money.
All Actions proceed either from the doers disposition, or not.
Those that proceed not from the Doers disposition are such as he does by Chance, by Compulsion, or by Natural necessity.
Those that proceed from the Doers disposition, are such as he does by Custom, or upon Premeditation, or in Anger, or out of Intemperance.
By Chance are said to be done those things whereof neither the Cause, nor the Scope is evident;
and which are done nei- ther orderly, nor always, nor most commonly after the same manner.
By Nature are said to be done those things, the Causes whereof are in the Doer;
and are done orderly, and always, or for the most part after the same manner.
By Compulsion are done those things, which are against the Appetite, and Ordination of the Doer.
By Custom those Actions are said to be done, the Cause whereof is this, that the Doer has done them often.
Upon Premeditation are said to be done those things which are done for profit, as the End, or the way to the End.
In Anger are said to be done those things which are done with a purpose to Revenge.
Out of Intemperance are said to be done those things which are delightful.
In sum, every Voluntary Action tends either to Profit or Pleasure.
The Colours of Profitable are already set down.
The Colours of that which is Pleasing follow next.
PLEASURE is a sudden and sensible motion of the Soul, towards that which is Natural.
Grief is the Contrary.
Pleasant therefore is that, which is the cause of such motion.
And to return to ones own Nature.
And Customes.
And those things that are not violent.
Unpleasant are those things, which proceed from Necessity, as Cares, Study, Contentions.
The contrary whereof, Ease, Remission from Labour and Care:
also, Play, Rest, Sleep, are PleasantPleasant -also is that, to which we have an appetite.
Also the appetites themselves, if they be sensual;
as Thirst, Hunger, and Lust.
Also those things to which we have an appetite upon per­ swasion and Reason.
And those things we remember, whether they pleased, or displeased, then when they were present.
And the things we hope for.
And Anger.
And to be in Love.And Revenge.
And Victory.
Therefore,Also contentious Games;
as Tables, Chess, Dice, Tennis, etc.And Hunting.
And Suits in Law.And Honour and Reputation amongst men in Honour and Reputation.
And to Love.
And to be Beloved and Respected..And to be Admired.
And to be Flattered.
And a Flatterer:
(for he seems both to love and admire).
And the same thing often.
And Change, or Variety.
And what we return to afresh.
And to learn.
And to admire.
And to do Good.
And to receive Good.
And to help up again one that's fallen.
And to finish that which is unperfect.
And Imitation.
And therefore the Art of Painting.
And the Art of Carving Images.
And the Art of Poetry.
And Pictures and Statues.
And other Mens Dangers, so they be near.
And to have escaped hardly.
And things of a kind please one another.
And every one himself.
And one's own pleases him.
And to bear Sway.
And to be thought Wise.
And to dwell upon that which he is good at.
And ridiculous Actions, Sayings, and Persons.
OF the Causes which move to Injury, namely, Profit and Pleasure, has been already spoken, Chap. 6, 7, 11.
It follows next to speak of the Persons, that are apt to do Injury.
The Doers of Injury are, Such as think they can do it.
And such as think to be undiscovered when they have done it.
And such as think, though they be discovered, they shall not be called in question for it.
And such as think, though they be called in question for it, that their Mulct will be less than their Gain, which either themselves or their Friends receive by the Injury.
Able to do Injury are, Such as are Eloquent.
And such as are practised in Business.
And such as have skill in Process.
And such as have many Friends.
And Rich Men.
And such as have Rich Friends;
or Rich Servants;
or Rich, Partners.
Undiscovered when they have done it, are, Such as are not apt to commit the crimes whereof they are accused :
as Feeble Men, Slaughter :
Poor, and not Beautiful Men, Adultery.
And such as one would think could not chuse but be dis­ covered.
And such as do Injuries, whereof there hath been no Example.
And such as have none, or many enemies.
And such as can easily conceal what they do.
And such as have some body to transfer the fault upon.
They that do Injury openly, are, Such whose friends have been Injured.
And such as have the Judges for friends.
And such as can escape their Tryal at Law.
And such as can put off their Tryal.
And such as can corrupt the Judges.
And such as can avoid the payment of their Fine.
And such as can defer the payment.
And such as cannot pay at all.
And such as by the Injury get manifestly, much, and pre­ sently ;
when the Fine is uncertain, little, and to come.
And such as get by the Injury, money;
by the penalty, shame only.
And such on the Contrary, as get honour by the Injury, and suffer the mulct of money, only, or banishment, or the like.
And such as have often escaped, or been undiscovered.
And such as have often attempted in vain.
And such as consider present pleasure, more than pain to come;
and so intemperate men are apt to do Injury.
And such as consider pleasure to come, more than present pain ;
and so temperate men are apt to do Injury.
And such as may seem to have done it by Fortune, Nature, Necessity, or Custom;
and by Error, rather than by Injustice.
And such as have means to get pardon.
And such as want Necessaries, as poor men:
or Unneces­ saries, as rich men.
And such as are of very good, or very bad Reputation.
OF those that do Injury, and why they do it, it hath been already spoken.
Now of the persons that suffer, and of the Matter wherein they suffer, the common Opinions are these :
Persons obnoxious to Injury are,Such as have the things that we want, either as necessary, or as delightful.
And such as are far from us.
And such as are at hand.
And such as are unwary, and credulous.
And such as are lazy.
And such as are modest.
And such as have swallowed many Injuries.
And such as have Injured often before.
And such as never before.
And such as are in our danger.
And such as are ill beloved generally.
And such as are envyed.
And our Friends.
And our Enemies.
And such as, wanting friends, have no great ability either in speech or action.
And such as shall be losers by going to Law:
as, Strangers, and Workmen.
And such as have done the Injuries they suffer.
And such as have committed a crime, or would have done, or are about to do.
And such as, by doing them an Injury, we shall gratifie our friends or superiours.
And such, whose friendship we have newly left, and accuse.
And such as another would do the Injury to, if we should not.
And such as by Injuring, we get greater means of doing good.
The Matters wherein men are obnoxious to Injury are,Those things wherein all, or most men use to deal unjustly.
And those things which are easily hid, and put off into other hands, or altered.
And those things which a man is ashamed to have suffered.
And those things wherein prosecution of Injury, may be thought a love of contention.
WHEN the fact is evident, the next Inquiry is, whether it be Just, or Unjust.
For the Definition of Just and Unjust, we must know what Law is:
that is, what the Law of Nature, what the Law of Nations;
what the Law Civil, what written Law, and what unwritten Lar is:
and what Persons, that is, what a publick Person, or the City is;
and what a private Person, or Citi­ zen is.
Unjust in the opinion of all men, is that which is contrary to the Law of Nature.
Unjust in the opinion of all men of those Nations which traffick and come together, is that which is contrary to the Law common to those Nations.
Unjust only in one Common-wealth, is that which is con­ trary to the Law Civil, or Law of that Common-wealth.
He that is accused to have done any thing against the Pub­ lick, or a private Person, is accused to do it either ignorantly, or unwillingly, or in anger, or upon premeditation.
And because the Defendant does many times confess the fact, but deny the unjustice;
as that he took, but did not steal:
and did, but not adultery;
it is necessary to know the Defini­ tions of Theft, Adultery, and all other crimes.
What facts are contrary to the written Laws, may be known by the Laws themselves.
Besides written Laws, whatsoever is Just, proceeds from Equity or Goodness.
From Goodness proceeds that which we are praised, or honoured for.
From Equity proceed those actions, which though the writ­ ten Law command not, yet being interpreted reasonably, and supplyed, seems to require at our hands.
Actions of Equity are such as these,Not too rigorously to punish Errors, Mischances, or Injuries.
To pardon the faults that adhere to Mankind.
And not to consider the Law so much, as the Law-makers mind;
and not the Words so much, as the meaning of the Law 1.
And not to regard so much the Fact, as the intention of the Doer;
nor part of the Fact, but the Whole;
nor what the Doer is, but what he has been always, or for the most part.
And to remember better the Good received, than the III.
And to endure injuries patiently.
And to submit rather to the Sentence of a Judge, than of the Sword.
And to the sentence of an Arbitrator, rather than of a Judge.
COMMON Opinions concerning Injuries comparatively, are such as these:
Greater is the Injury which proceed from greater Iniquity.
And from which proceedeth greater damage.
And of which there is no revenge.
And for which there is no remedy.
And by occasion of which, he that hath received the Injury, hath done some mischief to himself.
He does the greater Injury, that does it first, or alone, or with few.
And he that does it often.
Greater Injury is that, against which Laws and Penalties were first made.
And that which is more brutal, or more approaching to the actions of beasts.
And that which is done upon more premeditation.
And by which more Laws are broken.
And which is done in the place of Execution.
And which is of greatest shame to him that receives the Injury.
And which is committed against well deservers.
And which is committed against the unwritten Law;
be­ cause good men should observe the Law for Justice, and not for fear of punishment.
And which is committed against the written Law ;
because he that will do Injury, neglecting the penalty set down in the written Law, is much more likely to transgress the unwritten Law, where there is no penalty at all.
OF Artificial Proofs we have already spoken.
Inartificial Proofs, which we invent not, but make use of, are of five sorts.
1. Laws.
And those are Civil, or written Law:
the Law or Custom of Nations:
and the universal Law of Nature.
2.
Witness.
And those are such as concern Matter;
and such as concern Manners.
Also, they be ancient, or present.
3. Evidences, or Writings.4. Question, or Torture.5.
Oaths.
And those be either given, or taken, or both, or neither.
For Laws, we use them thus:
When the written Law makes against us, we appeal to the Law of Nature, alledging,That to be greatest Justice, which is greatest Equity.
That the Law of Nature is immutable;
the written Law mutable.
That the written Law is but seeming justice;
the Law of Nature very Justice.
And Justice is among those things which are, and not which seem to be.
That the Judge ought to discern between true and adul­ terate Justice.
That they are better men that obey unwritten, than written Laws.
That the Law against us does contradict some other Law.
And when the Law has a double interpretation, that is the true one, which makes for us.
And that the cause of the Law being abolished, the Law is no more of Validity.
But when the written Law makes for us, and Equity for the Adversary, we must alledge,That a man may use Equity, not as a liberty to judge against the Law;
but only as a security against being for­ sworn, when he knows not the Law.
That men seek not Equity because 'tis good simply, but be­ cause good for them.
That it is the same thing not to make, and not to use the Law.
That as in other Arts, and namely in Physick, fallacies are pernitious;
so in a Common-wealth 'tis pernitious to use pre­ texts against the Law.
And that in Common-wealths well instituted, to seem wiser than the Laws, is prohibited.
For Witnesses, we must use them thus:
When we have them not, we must stand for Presumptions, and say,That in Equity sentence ought to be given according to the most probability.
That Presumptions are the testimony of the things them­ selves, and cannot be bribed.
That they cannot lye.
When we have Witnesses, against him that has them not, we must say,That Presumptions, if they be false, cannot be punished.
That if Presumptions were enough, Witnesses were super­ fluous.
For Writings, when they favour us, we must say,That Writings are private and particular Laws;
and he that takes away the use of Evidences, abolisheth the Law.
That since Contracts and Negotiations pass by Writings, he that bars their use, dissolves humane Society.
Against them, if they favour the Adversary, we may say,That since Laws do not bind, that are fraudulently made to pass, much less Writings.
And that the Judge being to dispense Justice, ought rather to consider what is just, than what is in the Writing.
That Writings may be gotten by fraud or force;
but Justice by neither.
That the Writing is repugnant to some Law, Civil, or Natural;
or to Justice;
or to Honesty.
That 'tis repugnant to some other Writing before, or after.
That it crosses some commodity of the Judge (which must not be said directly, but implyed cunningly).
For the Torture, if the giving of it make for us, we must say,That 'tis the only testimony that is certain.
But if it make for the Adversary, we may say,That men in forced by Torture, speak as well that which is false, as that which is true.
That they who can endure, conceal the truth;
and they who cannot, say that which is false to be delivered from pain.
For Oaths ;
he that will not put his Adversary to his Oath, may alledge,That he makes no scruple to beforsworn.
That by swearing, he will carry the cause;
which not swearing, he must lose.
That he had rather trust his cause in the hand of the Judge, than of the Adversary.
He that refuseth to take the Oath, may say,That the matter is not worth so much.
That if he had been an evil man, he had sworn, and carryed his cause.
That to try it by swearing for a religious man against an irreligious, is as hard a match, as to set a weak man against a strong in combate.
He that is willing to take the Oath, may pretend,That he had rather trust himself, than his Adversary ;
and that 'tis equal dealing for an irreligious man to give, and for a religious man to take the Oath.
That 'tis his duty to take the Oath, since he has required to have sworn Judges.
He that offers the Oath may pretend,That he does piously commit his cause to the Gods.
That he makes his Adversary himself Judge.
That 'twere absurd for him not to swear, that has required the Judges to be sworn.
And of these are to be compounded the Forms we are to use, when we would give, and not take the Oath;
or take, and not give ;
or both give and take ;
or neither give nor take.
But if one have sworn contrary to a former Oath, he may pretend,That he was forced.
That he was deceived, and that neither of these is Perjury, since Perjury is voluntary.
But if the Adversary do so, he may say,That he that stands not to what he hath sworn, subverteth humane Society.
And (turning to the Judge)
What reason have we to re­ quire, that you should be sworn, that judge our cause;
when we will not stand to that we swear ourselves.
And so much for Proofs inartificial.
OF Belief proceeding from our Invention, that part which consisteth in Proof, is already spoken of.
The other two parts follow;
whereof one ariseth from the manners of the Speaker;
the other from the passions of the Hearer.
The Principles, Colours, or Common Opinions upon which a mans belief is grounded concerning the manners of him that speaks, are to be had partly out of that which hath been said before concerning Vertue, book i. chap.
9, partly out of those things which shall be said by and by, concerning the Passions.
For a man is believed either for his Prudence, or for his Probity, which are Vertues;
or for Good Will:
of which among the Passions.
The Principles concerning Belief, arising from the Passion of the Hearer, are to be gathered from that which shall now be said of the several Passions in order.
In every one of which three things are to be considered:
1.
First, how men are affected.
2. Secondly, towards whom.3.
Thirdly, for what.
ANGER is desire of Revenge, joyned with grief for that he, or some of his, is, or seems to be neglected.
The object of Anger is always some particular, or individual thing.
In Anger there is also pleasure proceeding from the imagina­ tion of revenge to come.
To Neglect, is to esteem little or nothing:
and of three kinds.
1. Contempt.2. Crossing.3. Contumely.
Contempt, is when a man thinks another of little worth in comparison to himself.
Crossing, is the hinderance of another mans will without design to profit himself.
Contumely, is the disgracing of another for his own pastime.
The common Opinions concerning Anger are therefore such as follow:
They are easily Angry that think they are neglected.
That think they excell others;
as the Rich with the Poor ;
the Noble with the Obscure, etc.
And such as think they deserve well.
And such as grieve to be hindered, opposed, or not assisted.
And therefore sick men, poor men, lovers, and generally all that desire and attain not, are angry with those that standing by, are not moved with their wants.
And such as having expected good, find evil.
Those that men are angry with, are,Such as mock, deride, or jest at them.
And such as shew any kind of Contumely, towards them.
And such as despise those things which we spend most la­ bour and study upon :
and the more, by how much we seem the less advanced therein.
And our friends, rather than those that are not our friends.
And such as have honoured us, if they continue not.
And such as requite not our courtesie.
And such as follow contrary courses, if they be our inferiours.
And our friends, if they have said, or done us evil, or not good.
And such as give not eare to our intreaty.
And such as are joyful, or calm in our distress.
And such as troubling us, are not themselves troubled.
And such as willingly hear or see our disgraces.
And such as neglect us in the presence of our Competitors;
of those we admire ;
of those we would have admire us ;
of those we reverence;
and of those that reverence us.
And such as should help us, and neglect it.
And such as are in jest, when we are in earnest.
And such as forget us, or our Names.
An Orator therefore must so frame his Judge or Auditor by his Oration ;
as to make him apt to Anger:
and then make his Adversary appear such as men use to be angry withal.
RECONCILIATION is the appeasing of Anger.
Those to whom men are easily reconciled, are,Such as have not offended out of neglect.
And such as have done it against their will.
And such as wish done the contrary of what they have done.
And such as have done as much to themselves.
And such as confess and repent.
And such as are humbled.
And such as do seriously the same things, that they do se­ riously.
And such as have done them more good heretofore, than now hurt.
And such as sue to them for any thing.
And such as are not insolent, nor mockers, nor slighters of others in their own disposition.
And generally such as are of a contrary disposition to those, whom men are usually angry withal.
And such as they fear or reverence.
And such as reverence them.
And such as have offended their Anger.
Reconcileable are,Such as are contrarily affected to those whom we have said before to be easily angry.
And such as play, laugh, make merry, prosper, live in plen­ ty ;
and in sum, all that have no cause of grief.
And such as have given their anger time.
Men lay down their Anger for these Causes.
Because they have gotten the Victory.
Because the Offender has suffered more than they meant to inflict.
Because they have been revenged of another.
Because they think they suffer justly.
And because they think the revenge will not be felt, or not known that the revenge was theirs, and for such an injury.
And because the Offender is dead.
Whosoever therefore would asswage the anger of his Audi­ tor, must make himself appear such, as men use to be recon­ ciled unto:
and beget in his Auditor such opinions, as make him reconcileable.
To Love, is to will well to another, and that for others, not for our own sake.
A Friend is he that loves, and he that is beloved.
Friends one to another, are they that naturally love one another.
A Friend therefore is he,That rejoyceth at anothers Good.
And that grieves at his hurt.
And that wishes the same with us to a third, whether good, or hurt.
And that is Enemy or Friend to the same man.
We love them,That have done good to us, or ours;
especially if much, readily, or in season.
That are our Friends Friends.
That are our Enemies Enemies.
That are Liberal.
That are Valiant.
That are Just.
And that we would have love us.
And good Companions.
And such as can abide Jests.
And such as break Jests.
And such as praise us, especially for somewhat that we doubt of in our selves.
And such as are neat.
And such as upbraid us not with our vices, or with their own benefits.
And such as quickly forget injuries.
And such as least observe our Errors.
And such as are not of ill Tongue-And those that are ignorant of our Vices.
And such as cross us not when we are busie, or angry.
And such as are officious towards us.
And those that are like us.
And such as follow the same course or trade of life, where they impeach not one another.
And such as labour for the same thing, when both may be satisfied.
And such as are not ashamed to tell us freely their faults, so it be not in contempt of us, and the faults such, as the World, rather than their own Consciences condemns.
And such as are ashamed to tell us of their very faults.
And such as we would have honour us, and not envie, but imitate us.
And such as we would do good to, except with greater hurt to our selves.
And such as continue their Friendship to the dead.
And such as speak their mind.
And such as are not terrible.
And such as we may rely on.
The several kinds of Friendship, are Society, Familiarity, Consanguinity, Affinity, etc.
The things that beget Love, are,The bestowing of Benefits,Gratis.
Unasked.
Privately.
THE Colours, or Common Opinions concerning Hatred are to be taken from the contrary of those, which concern Love and Friendship.
Hatred differs from Anger in this,That Anger regards only what is done to ones self;
but Hatred not.
And in this, that Anger regards particulars only;
the other universals also.
And in this, that Anger is curable, Hatred not.
And in this, that Anger seeks the vexation, Hatred the damage of ones Adversary.
That with Anger there is always joined Grief;
with Hatred not always.
That Anger may at length be satiated, but Hatred never.
Hence it appears how the Judge or Auditor may be made Friend or Enemy to us;
and how our Adversary may be made appear Friend or Enemy to the Judge;
and how we may answer to our Adversary, that would make us appear Enemies to him.
FEAR is a trouble, or vexation of the mind, arising from the apprehension of an evil at hand, which may hurt or destroy.
Danger is the nearness of the evil feared.
The things to be feared, are,Such as have power to hurt.
And the signs of will to do us hurt, as Anger and Hatred of powerful men.
And Injustice joyned with Power.
And Valour provoked, joyned with Power.
And the fear of powerful men.
The men that are to be feared, are,Such as know our Faults.
And such as can do us Injury.
And such as think they are injured by us.
And such as have done us Injury.
And our Competitors in such things as cannot satisfie both.
And such as are feared by more powerful men than we are.
And such as have destroyed greater men than we are.
And such as use to invade their inferiours.
And men not passionate, but dissemblers, and crafty, are more to be feared than those that are hasty and free.
The things especially to be feared, are,Such, wherein if we err, the error cannot be repaired;
at least, not according to ours, but our Adversaries pleasure.
And such as admit either none, or not easie help.
And such as being done, or about to be done to others, make us pity them.
They that fear not, are,Such as expect not evil;
or not now;
or not this;
or not from these.
And therefore men fear little in prosperity.
And men fear little that think they have suffered already.
An Orator therefore that would put Fear into the Auditor, must let him see that he is obnoxious ;
and that greater than he do suffer, and have suffered from those, and at those times they least thought.
ASSURANCE is hope, arising from an imagination that the help is near, or the evil afar off.
The things therefore that beget Assurance are,The remoteness of those things that are to be feared, and the nearness of their contraries.
And the facility of great, or many helps or remedies.
And neither to have done, nor received Injury.
And to have no Competitors, or not great ones, or if great ones, at least friends;
such as we have obliged, or are obliged to.
And that the danger is extended to more, or greater than us.
Assured, or Confident, are,They that have oft escaped danger.
And they to whom most things have succeeded well.
And they that see their Equals, or inferiours not afraid.
And they that have wherewith to make themselves feared, as wealth, strength, etc.
And such as have done others no wrong.
And such as think themselves in good terms with God Almighty.
And such as think they will speed well that are gone before.
SHAME is a perturbation of the Mind arising from the appre­ hension of Evil, past, present, or to come, to the prejudice of a mans own, or his friends reputation.
The things therefore which men are ashamed, of are those Actions which proceed from Vice, as,To throw away ones Arms;
to run away;
signs of Coward­ liness.
To deny that which is committed to ones trust, a sign of Injustice.
To have lyen with whom, where, and when we ought not, signs of Intemperance.
To make gain of small and base things;
not to help with money whom and how much we ought;
to receive help from meaner men;
to ask money at use from such as one thinks will borrow of him;
to borrow of him that expects payment of somewhat before lent;
and to redemand what one has lent, of him that one thinks will borrow more;
and so to praise, as one may be thought to ask;
signs of Wretchedness.
To praise one to his face;
to praise his vertues too much, and colour his vices;
signs of Flattery.
To be unable to indure such labours as men indure that are elder, tenderer, greater in quality, and of less strength than he ;
signs of Effeminacy.
To be beholden often to another;
and to upbraid those that are beholding to him;
signs of Pusillanimity.
To speak and promise much of ones self more than is due ;
signs of Arrogance.
To want those things which ones Equals, all, or most of them have attained to, is also a thing to be ashamed of.
And to suffer things ignominious, as to serve about mothers person ;
or to be imployed in his base Actions.
In Actions of Intemperance, whether willingly, or unwill­ ingly committed;
there is shame in Actions of Force, only when they are done unwillingly.
The men before whom we are ashamed, are such as we respect;
namely, Those that admire us.
And those whom we desire should admire us.
And those whom we admire.
Those that contend with us for Honour.
Those whose opinion we contemn not.
And therefore men are most ashamed in the presence,Of old and well bred men.
Of those we are always to live with.
Of those that are not guilty of the same fault.
Of those that do not easily pardon.
,And of those that are apt to reveal our faults;
such as are men injured, Backbiters, Scoffers, Comick Poets.
And of those before whom we have had always good success.
And of those who never asked any thing of us before.
And of such as desire our Friendship.
And of our familiars, that know none of our crimes.
And of such as will reveal our faults to any of those that are named before.
But in the presence of such whose judgment most men despise, men are not ashamed.
Therefore we are ashamed also in the presence, Of those whom we reverence.
And of those who are concerned in our own, or Ancestors, or Kinsfolks actions or misfortunes, if they be shameful.
And of their Rivals.
And of those that are to live with them that know their disgrace.
The Common Opinions concerning Impudence are taken from the contrary of these.
GRACE is that Vertue, by which a man is said to do a good turn, or to do service to a man in need;
not for his own but for his cause to whom he does it.
Great Grace is when the need is great;
or when they are hard or difficult things that are conferred, or when the time is seasonable, or when he that confers the favour is the only, or the first man that did it.
Need, is a desire joyned with grief for the absence of the thing desired.
Grace therefore it is not, if it be not done to one that needs.
Whosoever therefore would prove that he has done a Grace, or Favour, must shew that he needeth it to whom it was done.
Grace it is not,Which is done by Chance.
Nor which is done by Necessity.
Nor which has been Requited.
Nor that which is done to ones Enemy.
Nor that which is a Trifle.
Nor that which is Nought, if the Giver know the fault.
And in this manner a man may go over the Predicaments, and examine a benefit, whether it be a Grace for being This, or for being so Much, or for being Such, or for being Now, etc.
PITY is a perturbation of the mind, arising from the appre­ hension of hurt or trouble to another that doth not deserve it.
and which he thinks may happen to himself, or his.
And because it appertains to Pity, to think that he, or his may fall into the misery he pities in others, it follows that they be most compassionate,Who have passed through Misery.
And old Men.
And weak Men.
And timorous Men.
And learned Men.
And such as have Parents, Wife, and Children.
And such as think there be honest Men.
And that they are less compassionate,Who are in great despair.
Who are in great prosperity.
And they that are angry;
for they consider not.
And they that are very confident;
for they also consider not.
And they that are in the Act of contumely;
for neither do these consider.
And they that are astonished with fear.
And they that think no Man honest.
The things to be pitied are,Such as grieve, and withal hurt.
Such as destroy.
And Calamities of fortune, if they be great;
as none or few friends, deformity, weakness, lameness, etc.
And evil that arrives where good is expected.
And after extream evil, a little good.
And through a Mans life to have no good offer it self;
or being offered, not to have been able to enjoy it.
Men to be pitied are,Such as are known to us, unless they be so near to us, as their hurt be our own.
And such as be of our own years.
Such as are like us in manners.
Such as are of the same, or like stock.
And our equals in dignity.
Those that have lately suffered, or are shortly to suffer in­ jury :
and those that have the marks of injury past.
And those that have the words or actions of them in the present misery.
OPPOSITE in a manner to Pity in good Men, is Indignation, which is grief for the prosperity of a Man unworthy.
With Indignation there is always joyned a joy for the pros­ perity of a Man worthy, as Pity is always with contentment in the adversity of them that deserve it.
In wicked Men the opposite of Pity is,Envy;
as also the companions thereof delight in the harm of others, which the Greeks in one word have called έπικαιϱεκακία.
But of these in the next Chapter.
Men conceive Indignation against others, not for their ver­ tues, as Justice, etc.
For these make Men worthy ;
and in Indignation we think Men unworthy.
But for those goods which men indued with vertue, and noble Men, and handsome Men are worthy of.
And for newly gotten power and riches, rather than for antient, and especially if by these he has gotten other goods, as by Riches, Command.
The reason why we conceive greater Indignation against new than antient Riches, is, that the for­ mer seem to possess that which is none of theirs.
But the antient seem to have but their own.
For with common peo­ ple, to have been so long, is to be so by Right.
And for the bestowing of goods incongruously:
as when the- arms of the most valiant Achilles were bestowed on the most eloquent Ulysses.
And for the comparison of the inferiour is the same thing, as when one valiant is compared with a more valiant;
or whe­ ther absolutely superiour, as when a good Scholer is compared with a good Man.
Apt to Indignation are,They that think themselves worthy of the greatest goods, and do possess them.
And they that are good.
And they that are ambitious.
And such as think themselves deserve better what another possesseth, than he that hath it.
Least apt to Indignation are,Such as are of a poor, servile, and not ambitious Nature.
Who they are that Rejoyce, or Grieve not, at the adversity of him that suffers worthily, and in what occasions may be gathered from the contrary of what has been already said.
Whosoever therefore would turn away the Compassion of the Judge, he must make him apt to Indignation;
and shew that his Adversary is unworthy of the Good, and worthy of the Evil which happens to him.
ENVY'is grief, for the prosperity of such as ourselves, arising not from any hurt that we, but from the good that they receive.
Such as our selves, I call those that are equal to us in blood, in age, in abilities, in glory, or in means.
They are apt to Envy,That are within a little of the highest.
And those that are extraordinarily honoured for some quality that is singular in them, especially Wisdom or good Fortune.
And such as would be thought wise.
And such as catch at glory in every action.
And Men of poor spirits:
for every thing appears great to them.
The things which Men Envy in others are,Such as bring Glory.
And goods of Fortune.
And such things as we desire for our selves.
And things in the possession whereof we exceed others, or they us a little.
Obnoxious to Envy are,Men of our own time, of our own Countrey, of our own age, and competitors of our Glory.
And therefore,Those whom we strive with for honour.
And those that covet the same things that we do.
And those that get quickly, what we hardly obtain, or not at all.
And those that attain unto, or do the things that turn to our reproach, not being done by us.
And those that possess what we have possessed heretofore.
So old and decayed Men envy the young and lusty.
And those that have bestowed little, are subject to be en­ vyed by such as have bestowed much upon the same thing.
From the contraries of these may be derived the Principles concerning Joy for other Mens hurt.
He therefore that would not have his Enemy prevail, when he craves Pity, or other favour;
must dispose the Judge to Envy;
and make his Adversary appear such, as above de­ scribed, to be subject to the Envy of others.
,EMULATION is grief arising from that our Equals possess such goods as are had in honour, and whereof we are capable, but have them not;
not because they have them, but because not we also.
No 'Man therefore Emulates another in things whereof him­ self is not capable.
Apt to Emulate are,Such as esteem themselves worthy of more than they have.
And Young and Magnanimous Men.
And such as already possess the goods for which Men are honoured :
for they measure their worth by their having.
And those that are esteemed worthy by others.
And those whose Ancestors, Kindred, Familiars, Nation, City, have been eminent for some good, do Emulate others for that good.
Objects of Emulation are, for things ;
Vertues.
And things whereby we may profit others.
And things whereby we may please others.
For Persons,
They that possess such things.
And such as many desire to be friends or acquainted with, or like unto.
And they whose praises flie abroad.
The contrary of Emulation is Contempt.
And they that Emulate such as have the goods aforemen­ tioned, Contemn such as have them not:
and thence it is, that Men who live happily enough, unless they have the goods which Men honour, are nevertheless Contemned.
OF Passions we have already spoken.
We are next to speak of Manners.
Manners are distinguished by Passions, Habits, Ages, and Fortunes.
What kind of Manners proceed from Passions, and from Vertues and Vices (which are Habits), bath been already shewed.
There remains to be spoken of the Manners, that are pe­ culiar to several Ages and Fortunes.
The Ages are Youth, Middle-Age, Old-Age.
And first of Youth.
Young Men are,Violent in their desires.
Prompt to execute their desires.
Incontinent.
Inconstant, easily forsaking what they desired before.
Longing mightily, and soon satisfied.
Apt to anger, and in their anger violent:
and ready to ex­ ecute their anger with their hands.
Lovers of Honour and of Victory more than Money, as having not been yet in Want.
Well natured, as having not been acquainted with, much malice.
Full of hope, both because they have not yet been often frustrated, and because they have by natural heat that disposi­ tion that other Ages have by Wine;
Youth being a kind of natural drunkenness.
Besides, hope is of the time to come, whereof Youth hath much, but of the time past little.
Credulous, because not yet often deceived.
Easily deceived, because full of hope.
Valiant, because apt to Anger and full of hope;
whereof this begets confidence, the other keeps off Fear.
Bashful, because they estimate the Honour of Action by the precepts of the Law.
Magnanimous, because not yet dejected by the misfortunes of human life.
And lovers of Honour more than Profit, because they live more by Custom than by Reason;
and by Reason we acquire Profit, but Vertue by Custom.
Lovers of their Friends and Companions.
Apt to err in the excess, rather than the defect, contrary to that precept of Chilon, Ne quid nimis;
for they overdo every thing:
they Love too much, and Hate too much, because thinking themselves wise, they are obstinate in the opinion they have once delivered.
Doers of Injury rather for contumely than for Dammage.
Mercifull, because measuring others by their own innocence, they think them better than they be, and therefore less to merit what they suffer;
which is a cause of Pity.
And lovers of Mirth, and by consequence such as love to jest at others.
Jesting is witty Contumely.
THE Manners of Old Men are in a manner the contraries of those of Youth.
They determine nothing:
they do every thing less vehe­ mently than is fit:
they never say they know;
but to every thing they say, perhaps, and peradventure;
which comes to pass from that having lived long, they have often mistaken and been deceived.
They are peevish because they interpret every thing to the worst.
And suspicious through Incredulity, and incredulous by reason of their Experience.
They love and hate, as if they meant to continue in neither.
Are of poor spirits, as having been humbled by the chances of life.
And covetous, as knowing how easie 'tis to lose, and hard to get.
And timorous, as having been cooled by years.
And greedy of life:
for good things seem greater by the want of them.
And lovers of themselves out of Pusillanimity.
And seek Profit more than Honour, because they love themselves;
and Profit is among the goods that are not simply good, but good for ones self.
And without bashfulness, because they despise seeming.
And hope little;
knowing by Experience that many times good Counsel has been followed with ill event, and because also they be timorous.
And live by Memory rather than Hope;
for Memory is of the time past, whereof Old Men have good store.
And are full of Talk, because they delight in their Memory.
And Vehement in their anger:
but not stout enough to execute it.
They have weak, or no desires;
and thence seem Temperate.
They are slaves to Gain..
And live more by reason than Custom;
because reason leads to Profit, as Custom to that which is Honourable.
And do Injury to indammage, and not in Contumely.
And are mercifull by Compassion, or imagination of the same evils in themselves, which is a kind of Infirmity, and not Humanity, as in Young Men, proceeding from a good opinion of those that suffer Evil.
And full of complaint, as thinking themselves not far from Evil, because of their Infirmity.
Seeing then that every Man loves such Men, and their discourses, which are most agreeable to their own Manners;
'tis not hard to collect, how the Orator, and his Oration may be made acceptable to the Hearer, whether Young or Old.
THE Manners of Middle-aged Men, are between those of Youth, and Old Men, and therefore,They neither dare, nor fear too much:
but both as is fit.
They neither believe all;
nor reject all;
but judge.
They seek not only what is Honourable, nor only what is Profitable;
but both.
They are neither Covetous, nor Prodigal;
but in the mean.
They are neither easily Angry;
nor yet Stupid:
but be­ tween both.
They are Valiant, and withal Temperate.
And in general, whatsoever is divided in Youth, and Old Men, is compounded in Middle-age.
And whereof the Excess, or Defect is in Youth or Old Men;
the Mediocrity is in those of the Middle-age.
Middle-age for the Body, I call the time from thirty to five and thirty years:
for the Mind, the nine and fortieth, or thereabouts.
OF Manners that proceed from the several
Ages we have already spoken.
We are next to speak of those that rise from several Fortunes.
The Manners of the Nobility are,To be Ambitious.
To undervalue their Ancestors Equals.
For the goods of Fortune seem the more precious for their Antiquity.
Nobility is the vertue of a Stock.
And Generosity, is not to degenerate from the vertue of his stock.
For as in Plants, so in the Races of Men, there is a certain progress;
and they grow better and better to a certain point:
and change, viz.
Subtil wits into madness ;
and staid wits into stupidity and blockishness.
RICH Men are Contumelious and Proud.
This they have from their Riches.
For seeing every thing may be had for Money, having Money, they think they ,have all that is good.
And Effeminate;
because they have wherewithal to sub­ minister to their Lust.
And Boasters of their Wealth:
and speak in high terms foolishly.
For Men willingly talk of what they love and ad­ mire ;
and think others affect the same that they do:
and the truth is, all sorts of Men submit to the Rich.
And think themselves worthy to command, having that by which Men attain command.
And in general, they have the Manners of Fortunate Fools.
They do Injury, with intentions not to hurt, but to disgrace;
and partly also through Incontinence.
There is a difference between New and Antient Riches:
for they that are newly come to Wealth have the same faults in a greater degree:
for New Riches are a kind of rudeness and apprentiship of Riches.
THE Manners of Men in Power, are the same, or better than those of the Rich.•
They have a greater sense of Honour than the Rich;
and their Manners are more Manly.
They are more Industrious than the Rich:
for Power is sustained by Industry.
They are Grave, but without Austereness:
for being in place conspicuous, they carry themselves the more modestly;
and have a kind of gentle and comely Gravity, which the Greeks call σεμνότης.
When they do Injuries, they do great ones.
The Manners of Men that prosper, are compounded of the Manners of the Nobility, the Rich and those that are in Power, for to some of these all Prosperity appertains.
Prosperity in Children, and goods of the Body, make Men desire to exceed others in the goods of Fortune.
Men that Prosper have this ill, to be more proud and in­ considerate than others.
And this good;
that they worship God, trusting in him, for that they find themselves to receive more good than pro­ ceeds from their Industry.
The Manners of Poor Men, Obscure Men, Men without Power, and Men in Adversity, may be collected from the Con­ trary of what has been said.
WE have hitherto set down such Principles as are peculiar to several kinds of Orations.
Now we are to speak of such Places as are Common to them all;
as these, Possible, Done, or Past, Future, Great, Small.
Possible is that,The Contrary whereof is Possible.
And the like whereof is Possible.
And than which some harder thing is Possible.
And the beginning whereof is Possible.
And the end whereof is Possible.
And the usual consequent whereof is Possible.
And the beginning whereof is in the power of those whom we can either compell or perswade.
And part whereof is Possible.
And part of the whole that is Possible.
And the General if a Particular.
And a Particular if the General.
And of Relatives, if one, the other.
And that which without Art and Industry is Possible, is much more so with Art and Industry.
And that which is Possible to worse, weaker, and unskilfuller Men, is much more so to better, stronger, and more skilfulThe Principles concerning Impossible are the Contraries of these.
That Has been done,Than which a harder thing has been done.
And the consequent whereof has been done.
And that which being Possible, he had a will to, and no­ thing hindered.
And that which was Possible to him in his Anger.
And that which he longed to do.
And that which was before upon the point of doing.
And whose antecedent has been done;
or that, for which it uses to be done.
And if that, for whose cause we do this, then this.
The Principles concerning Not done are the Contraries of these.
That Shall be done,Which some Man can, and means to do.
And which some Man can, and desires to do.
And which is in the way, and upon the point to be done.
And the antecedents whereof are past.
And the Motive whereof is past.
Of Great and Small, More and Less, see chap.
vii. book 1.
OF the Principles both general and special from whence Proofs are to be drawn, has been already spoken.
Now follow the Proofs themselves which are Examples or Enthymemes.
An Example is either an Example properly so called (as some Action past):
or a Similitude (which is called a Para­ ble) :
or a Fable (which contains some Action feigned).
An Example properly so called, is this;
Darius came not into Greece, till he had first subdued Ægypt.
Xerxes also conquered AEgypt first;
then afterwards crossed the HeRes­ pont, We ought therefore to hinder the King of Persia from conquering Ægypt.
A Similitude, or Parable, is such as followeth:
They who choose their Magistrates by Lot, are like them that choose for their Champions those on whom the Lot shall fall, rather than those who have the greatest strength ;
and for their Pilot, not him that hath skill;
but him whose name is drawn out of the Urne.
A Fable is in this manner.
The Horse desiring to drive out the Stag from his common pasture, took a Man to assist Aim, and having received into his mouth a Bridle, and a Rider upon his Back, obtained his intent, but became subject to the Man.
So you of Himera, having (in hope to be revenged of your Enemies) given unto Phalaris Soveraign Authority, that is to say, taken a Bridle into your Mouths ;
if you shall also give him a Guard to his Person, that is, let him get up upon your Backs, you become his slaves presently past recovery.
To find out Examples, that is, Actions done that may serve our purpose, is therefore hard, because not in our power.
But to find Fables and Similitudes, is easier;
because by conversing in Philosophy, a Man may feign somewhat in na­ ture like to the case in hand.
Examples, Similitudes, and Fabbes, where Enthymemes are wanting, may serve us in the beginning of an Oration for In­ ductions;
otherwise are to be alledged after Enthymemes for Testimonies.
A SENTENCE is an universal Proposition concerning those things which are to be desired or avoided, in the Actions or Passions of the common life.
As,A wise Man will not suffer his Children to be over-learned.
And is to an Enthymeme in RhetoricA, as any Proposition is to a Syllogisme in LogicA.
And therefore a Sentence, if the reason be rendered, be­ comes a Conclusion, and both together make an Enthymeme.
As for Example,To be over-learned, besides that it begets effeminacy, pro­ cures envy.
Therefore he that's wise will not suffer his Chil­ dren to be over-learned.
Of Sentences there be four sorts.
For they either require Proofs, or not:
that is, are mani­ fest, or not.
Such as are manifest, are either so, as soon as they are ut­ tered ;
as,Health is a great good.
Or as soon as they are considered;
as,Men used to hate whom they have hurt.
Such as are not manifest, are either Conclusions of Enthy­ memes;
as,He that's wise will not suffer his Children, etc.
Or else are Enthymematical;
that is, have in themselves the force of an Enthymeme;
as,Mortal Men ought not to carry Immortal Anger.
A Sentence not Manifest, ought to be either Inferred or Confirmed.
Inferred thus:
'Tis not good to be effeminately minded, nor to be envyed by ones fellow Citizens.
A wise Man therefore will not have his Children over-learned.
Confirmed thus:
A wise Man will not have his Children over-learned, seeing too much Learning both softens a Mans mind, and procures him envy among his fellow Citizens.
If a reason be added to a manifest Sentence let it be short.
Sentences become not every Man;
but only old Men, and such as be well versed in business.
For to hear a young Man speak Sentences, is ridiculous;
and to hear an ignorant Man speak Sentences, is absurd.
Sentences generally received, when they are for our pur­ pose, ought not to be neglected, because they pass for truths.
And yet they may be denyed, when any laudable custom, or humour may thereby be made appear in the Denyer.
The commodities of Sentences, are two.
One proceeding from the Vanity of the Hearer, who takes for true universally affirmed, that which he has found for true only in some particular;
and therefore a Man ought to con­ sider in every thing what opinion the Hearer holds.
Another is, that Sentences do discover the manners and disposition of the speaker;
so that if they be esteemed good Sentences, he shall be esteemed a good Man;
and if evil, an evil Man..
Thus much of Sentences, what they be ;
of how many sorts ;
how to be used;
whom they become ;
and what is their profit.
SEEING an Enthymeme differs from a Logical Syllogisme, in that it neither concludes out of every thing, nor out of re­ mote Principles;
the Places of it, from whence a Man may argue, ought to be certain, and determinate.
And because whosoever makes a Syllogisme Rhetorical, or other, should know all, or the most part of that which is in question;
as, whosoever is to advise the Athenians in the question, whether they are to make War or no, must know what their Revenues be;
what, and what kind of power they have:
and he that will praise them, must know their acts at Salamis, Marathon, etc.
It will be necessary for a good speaker to have in readiness the choicest particulars of what­ soever he foresees he may speak of.
He that is to speak ex tempore, must comprehend in his speech as much as he can of what is most proper in the mat­ ter in hand.
Proper, I call those things which are least common to others ;
as, he that will praise Achilles, is not to declare such things as are common both to him, and Diomedes;
as that he was a Prince, and warred against the Trojans;
but such things as are proper only to Achilles;
as that he killed Hector and Cygnus;
went to the War young, and voluntary.
Let this therefore be one general Place, from that which is proper.
FORASMUCH as Enthymemes either infer truly, or seem only so to do;
and they which do infer indeed, be either Ostensive;
or such as bring a man to some impossibility;
we will first set down the Places of Enthymemes Ostensive.
An Ostensive Enthymeme is, wherein a man concludes the .
question from somewhat granted.
That Enthymeme which brings a Man to an impossibility, is an Enthymeme wherein from that which the Adversary maintaineth, we conclude that which is manifestly impossible.
All Places have been already set down in a manner in the precedent Propositions of Good, Evil, Just, Unjust, Honour­ able, and Dishonourable:
namely, they have been set down as applyed to Particular Subjects, or in Concrete.
Here they are to be set down in another manner;
namely in the Abstract or Universal.
The first Place then let be from Contraries, which in the Concrete or Particulars is exemplified thus.
If Intemperance he hurtful, Temperance is profitable:
and if Intemperance be not hurtful, neither is Temperance profitable.
Another Place may be from Cognomination or affinity of words:
as in this Particular.
If what is Just be Good ;
then what is justly is well:
but justly to die is not well:
there­ fore not all that is Just is Good.
A third from Relatives;
as, This Man has justly done, therefore the other has justly suffered.
But this Place some­ times deceives, for a man may suffer justly, yet not from Aim.
A fourth from Comparison, three ways.
From the Great to the Less:
as, He has stricken.his Father;
and therefore this Man.
From the Less to the Greater:
as, The Gods know not all things;
much less Man.
From Equality:
as, If Captains be not always the worse esteemed for losing a Victory;
why should Sophisters?
Another from the Time:
as Philip to the Thebans:
If I had required to pass through your Country with my Army, before I had ayded you against the Phocæans, there is no doubt but you would have promised it me.
It is absurd there­ fore to deny it me now, after I have trusted you.
A sixth from what the Adversary says of himself:
as, Iphicrates asked Aristophon, whether he would take a Bribe to betray the Army;
and he answering no;
What (say he) is it likely that Iphicrates would betray the Army;
and Aris­ tophon not?
This Place would be ridiculous, where the Defendant were not in much more estimation than the Accuser.
A seventh from the Definition ;
as that of Socrates;
a Spi­ rit is either God, or the Creature of God:
and therefore he denies not that there is a God, that confesses there are Spirits.
An eighth from the distinction of an ambiguous word.
A ninth from Division:
as, If all Men do what they do for one of three causes, whereof two are impossible ;
and the Ac­ cuser charge not the Defendant with the third;
it follows that he has not done it.
A tenth from Induction:
as, At Athens, at Thebes, at Sparta, etc.
And therefore every where.
An eleventh from Authority, or precedent sentence ;
as that of Sappho, that Death is evil, for that the Gods have judged it so, in exempting themselves from mortality.
A twelfth from the Consequence:
as, ' Tis not good to be envied;
therefore neither to be learned.
'
Tis good to be wise, therefore also to be instructed.
A thirteenth from two contrary Consequences ;
as,' Tis not good to be an Orator, because if he speak the truth, he shall displease Men:
If he speak falsely, he shall displease God.
Here is to be noted, that sometimes this argument may be retorted :
as thus, If you speak truth, you shall please God;
if you speak untruth, you shall please men:
therefore by all means be an Orator.
A Fourteenth from the quality that Men have to praise one thing, and approve another:
as, We ought not to war against the Athenians upon no precedent injury ;
for all Men discom­ mend injustice.
Again,
We ought to war against the Athenians;
for otherwise our Liberty is at their mercy, that is, is no Liberty;
but the preservation of Liberty is a thing that all Men will approve.
A Fifteenth from Proportion:
as, seeing we naturalize strangers for their vertues, why should we not banish this stranger for his vices ?
A Sixteenth from the similitude of Consequents:
as, He that denies the immortality of the Gods, is no worse than he that has written the generation of the Gods.
For the same Consequence follows of both, that sometimes there are none.
A Seventeenth from that, that Men change their mind:
as, If when we were in Banishment, we fbught to recover our Country, why should we notfight now to retain it?
An Eighteenth from a fained end:
as, that Diomedes chose Ulysses to go with him, not as more valiant than another;
but as one that would partake less of the Glory.
A Nineteenth from the Cause ;
as if he would infer he did it from this, that he had Cause to do it.
A Twentieth from that which is Incredible, but True:
as, that Laws may need a Law to mend them;
as well as Fish bred in the salt Water, may need salting.
LET the first Place be from inspection of Times, Actions, or Words, either of the Adversary, or of the Speaker, or both.
Of the Adversary;
as, He says, he loves the People, and yet he was in the Conspiracy of the Thirty.
Of the Speaker;
as, He says, I am contentious, and yet I never began Suit.
Of both ;
as,
He never conferred any thing to the benefit of the Commonwealth, whereas I have ransomed divers Citizens with mine own Money.
A Second, from shewing the cause of that which seemed amiss, and serves for Men of good reputation that are ac­ cused ;
as, The Mother that was accused of Incest for being seen embracing her Son, was absolved as soon as she made appear, that she embraced him upon his arrival from far, by way of Salutation.
A
Third, from rendring of the cause;
as, Leodamas, to whom it was objected, that he had, under the Thirty Tyrants, defaced the Inscription (which the People had set up in a Pillar) of his Ignominy;
answered, He had not done it;
be­ cause it would have been more to his commodity to let it stand;
thereby to indor himself to the Tyrants, by the Testimony of the Peoples hatred.
A Fourth, from better Counsel;
as, He might have done better for himself;
therefore he did not this.
But this Place deceives, when the better Counsel comes to mind after the Fact.
A Fifth, from Incompatibility of the things to be done ;
as,
They that did deliberate whether they should both mourn and sacrifice at the Funeral of Leucothea, were told, that if they thought her a Goddess, they ought not to Mourn ;
and if they thought her a Mortal, they ought not to Sacrifice.
A Sixth, (which is proper to Judicial Orations,) from an Inference of Errour;
as, If he did it not, he was not wise, therefore he did it 1.Enthymemes that lead to Impossibility, please more than Ostensive:
for they compare, and put contraries together, whereby they are the better set off, and more conspicuous to the Auditor.
Of all Enthymemes, they be best, which we assent to as soon as hear.
For such consent pleaseth us;
and makes us favourable to the Speaker.
OF seeming Enthymemes, one Place may be from the Form of speaking;
as when a Man has repeated divers Sentences, he brings in his Conclusion, as if it followed necessarily, though it do not.
A Second from an ambiguous word.
A
Third from that which is true divided, to that which is false joyned;
as that of Orestes, It was justice that I should revenge my Fathers death, and it was justice my Mother should die for killing my Father, therefore I justly killed my Mother.
Or from that which is true joyned, to that which is false divided;
as, one cup of Wine, and one cup of Wine, are hurtful;
therefore one cup of Wine is hurtful.
A Fourth from Amplification of the Crime.
For neither is the Defendant likely to have committed the Crime he ampli­ fies;
nor does the Accuser seem, when he is passionate, to want ground for his Accusation.
A Fifth from signs;
as, when a Man concludes the doing of the Fact from the manner of his life.
A Sixth from that which comes by chance, as if from this, that the Tyranny of Hipparchus came to be overthrown from the love of Aristogeiton to Harmodius, a Man should conclude, that in a free Common-wealth loving of Boys were profitable.
A Seventh from the Consequence, as Banishment is to be desired, because a banished Man has choice oflaces to dwell in.
An Eighth from making that the cause which is not;
as, In Demosthenes his Government, the War began;
therefore De­ mosthenes governed well.
With the Pelponnesian War be­ gan the Plague, therefore Pericles that perswaded that War, did ill.
A
Ninth from the Omission of some circumstance, as, Helen did what was lawful, when sIte ran away with Paris, because sAe had her Father's consent to choose her own Hus­ band;
which was true only during the time that she had not .
chosen.
A Tenth, from that which is probable in some case, to that which is probable simply;
as,' Tis probable, he foresaw, that if he did it, he should be suspected;
therefore 'tis probable he did it not.
From this Place one may infer both ways that he did it not.
For if he be not likely to do it, it may be thought he did it not, again, if he were likely to do it, it may be thought he did it not, for this, that he knew he should be suspected.
Upon this Place was grounded the Art, which was so much detested in Protagoras, of making the better cause seem the worse;
and the worse the better.
AN Argument is answered by an opposite Syllogisme, or by an Objection.
The Places of opposite Syllogismes are the same with the Places of Syllogismes, or Enthymemes:
for a Rhetorical Syl­ logisme is an Enthymeme.
The Places of Objections are four.
First, from the same, as, To the Adversary that proves love to be good by an Enthymeme, may be objected, that no want is good, and yet Love is want;
or particularly thus:
The Love of Myrrha to her Father was not good.
The Second from Contraries:
as, if the Adversary say, A good Man does good to his friends, an Objection might be made, that then an evil Man will do also evil to his friends.
The Third from Similitude:
as thus, if the Adversary say, all Men that are injured, do hate those that have injured them, it may be objected, that then, all Men that had received Bene­ fits should love their Benefactors, that is to say, be grateful.
The Fourth from the authority of famous men;
as when a Man shall say, that drunken Men ought to be pardoned those Acts they do in their drunkenness, because they know not what they do;
the Objection may be, that Pittacus was of an­ other mind, that appointed for such Acts a double punishment;
one for the Act, another for the Drunkenness.
And forasmuch as all Enthymemes are drawn from Proba­ bility, or Example, or from a Sign Fallible, or from a Sign Infallible:
an Enthymeme from Probability may be confuted really, by shewing that for the most part it falls out other­ wise ;
but apparently or sophistically, by shewing only that it does not fall out so alwayes;
whereupon the Judge thinks the Probability not sufficient to ground his Sentence upon.
[The Reason whereof is this, That the Judge, while he hears the Fact proved probable, conceives it as true.
For the Understanding has no Object but Truth.
And therefore by and by, when he shall hear an Instance to the contrary;
and thereby find that he had no necessity to think it true, presently changes his opinion, and thinks itfalse, and consequently not so much as probable.
For he cannot at one time think the same thing both probable and false:
and he that says a thing is probable, the meaning is, he thinks it true, but finds not arguments enough to prove it.]
An Enthymeme from a fallible sign, is answered, by shew­ ing the sign to be fallible.
An Enthymeme from an Example, is answered, as an En­ thymeme from Probability;
really, by shewing more Exam­ pies to the contrary;
apparently, if he bring Examples enough to make it seem not necessary.
If the Adversary have more Examples than we, we must make appear that they are not applycable to the Case.
An Enthymeme from an infallible sign, if the Proposition be true, is unanswerable.
THE first, that Amplification and Extenuation are not Com­ mon Places, appears by this, that Amplification and Extenu­ ation do prove a fact to be great, or little;
and are therefore Enthymemes, to be drawn from Common Places, and therefore are not the Places themselves.
The second, that Enthymemes, by which Arguments are answered, are of the same kind with those by which the mat­ ter in question is proved, is manifest by this, that these infer the opposite of what was proved by the other.
The third, that an Objection is no Enthymeme, is apparent by this, that an Objection is no more but an Opinion, Exam­ ple, or other Instance, produced to make appear, that the Ad-.
versaries Argument does not conclude.
Thus much of Examples, Sentences, Enthymemes, and ge­ nerally of all things that belong to Argumentation;
from what Places they may be drawn, or answered.
There remains Elocution and Disposition to be spoken of in the next Book.
THREE things being necessary to an Oration, namely, Proof, Elocution, and Disposition ;
we have done with the first, and shall speak of the other two in that which follows.
As for Action, or Pronuntiation, so much as is necessary for an Orator, may be fetcht out of the Book of the Art of Poetry, in which we have treated of the Action of the Stage.
For Tragedians were the first that invented such Action, and that but of late ;
and it consisteth in governing well the magnitude, tone, and measure of the Voice;
a thing less sub­ ject to Art, than is either Proof, or Elocution.
And yet there have been Rules delivered concerning it, as far forth as serve for Poetry.
But Oratorical Action has not been hitherto reduced to Art.
And Orators in the beginning, when they saw that the Poets in barren and feigned Arguments, nevertheless attained great Reputation;
supposing it bad proceeded from the choice, or connexion of words, fell into a Stile, by imitation of them, approaching to Verse, and made choice of words.
But when the Poets changed their Stile, and laid by all words that were not in common use, the Orators did the same, and lighted at last upon words, and a Government of the Voice and Measures proper to themselves.
Seeing therefore Pronuntiation, or Action are in some de­ gree necessary also for an Orator, the Precepts thereof are to be fetcht from the Art of Poetry.
[In the mean time this may be one general rule.
If the Words, Tone, Greatness of the Voice, Gesture of the Body and Countenance, seem to proceed all from one Passion, then 'tis well pronounced.
Otherwise not.
For when there appear more passions than one at once, the mind of the Speaker appears unnatural and dis­ tracted.
Otherwise, as the mind of the Speaker, so the mind of the Hearer always.]
THE Vertues of a Word are two ;
the first, that it be perspicu­ ous;
the second, that it be decent;
that is, neither above, nor below the thing signified;
or, neither too humble, nor too fine.
Perspicuous are all Words that be Proper.
Fine Words are those, that are borrowed, or Translated from other significations;
of which in the Art of Poetry.
The reason why borrowed Words please, is this.
Men are affected with Words, as they are with Men, admiring in both that which is Forraign and New.
To make a Poem graceful, many things help;
but few an Oration.
For to a Poet it sufficeth with what Words he can set out his Poem:
but an Orator must not only do that;
but also seem not to do it:
for else he will be thought to speak un­ naturally, and not as he thinks;
and thereby be the less believed ;
whereas belief is the scope of his Oration.
The Words that an Orator ought to use are of three sorts.
Proper;
such as are Received ;
and Metaphors.
Words taken from Forraign Languages, Words compounded, and Words new coyned, are seldom to be used.
Synonimaes belong to Poets, and Equivocal Words to Sophisters.
An Orator, if he use Proper Words, and Received, and good Metaphors, shall both make his Oration beautiful, and not seem to intend it;
and shall speak perspicuously.
For in a Metaphor alone there is Perspicuity, Novity, and Sweetness,Concerning Metaphors the Rules are these.
1.
He that will make the best of a thing, let him draw his Metaphor from somewhat that is better.
As for Example, let him call a Crime, an Error.
On the όther side, when he would make the worst of it, let him draw his Metaphor from somewhat worse, as, calling Error, Crime.2.
A Metaphor ought not to be so far fetcht, as that the Similitude may not easily appear.3.
A Metaphor ought to be drawn from the noblest things, as the Poets do that choose rather to say, Rosy-fingered, than Red-fingered Aurora.
In like manner the Rule of Epithets is,That he that will adorn, should use those of the better sort;
and he that will disgrace, should use those of the worse:
as Simonides being to Write an Ode in honour of the Victory gotten in a Course by certain Mules, being not well paid, called them by their name ['Ημιόνους ] that signifies their propinquity to Asses:
but having received a greater reward, stiles them the Sons of swift-footed Coursers.
THE things that make an Oration flat or insipide, are four.
1.
Words Compounded;
[and yet a Man may Compound a word, when the Composition is necessary, for want of a simple word;
and easie, and seldom used.]
2. Forraign Words.
As for Example, such as are newly derived from the Latine;
which though they were proper among them whose tongue it is, are Forraign in another Lan­ guage :
and yet these may be used, so it be moderately.
3.
Long, impertinent, and often Epithets.
4.
Metaphors, indecent, and obscure.
Obscure they are, when they are far fetcht.
Indecent when they are ridiculous, as in Comedies ;
or too grave, as in Tragedies.
A SIMILITUDE differs from a Metaphor only by such Par­ ticks of Comparison as these, As ;
Even as ;
So ;
Even so, etc.A
Similitude therefore is a Metaphor dilated;
and a Meta­ phor is a Similitude Contracted into one Word.
A Similitude does well in an Oration, so it be not too fre­ quent ;
for 'tis Poetical.
An Example of a Similitude, is this of Pericles ;
that said in his Oration, that the Baeotians were like to so many Oaks in a Wood, that did nothing but beat one another.
FOUR things are necessary to make Language Pure.1.
The right rendring of those Particles which some ante­ cedent Particle does require:
as to a Not only, a Not also ;
and then they are rendered right, when they are not sus­ pended too long.
2.
The use of proper Words, rather than Circumlocutions, unless there be motive to make one do it of purpose.
3.
That there be nothing of double construction, unless there be cause to do it of purpose.
As the Prophets (of the Heathen) who speak in general terms, to the end they may the better maintain the truth of their Prophesies;
which is easier maintained in generals, than in particulars.
For 'tis easier to divine, whether a number be even or odd, than how many;
and that a thing will be, than what it will be.
4.
Concordance of Gender, Number, and Person;
as not to say Him for Her;
Man for Men;
Hath for Have.
In Summ;
a Man's Language ought to be easie for another to read, pronounce, and point.
Besides, to divers Antecedents, let divers Relatives, or one common to them all, be correspondent:
as, He saw the Colour;
He heard the Sound;
or He perceived both Colour and Sound;
but by no means, He heard or saw both.
Lastly, that which is to be interposed by Parenthesis, let it be done quickly:
as, I purposed, having spoken to him (to this, and this purpose) afterward to be gone.
For to put it off thus:
I resolved, after I had spoken to him, to be gone ;
but the subject of my speech was to this and this purpose, is vitious.
A MAN shall add Amplitude, or Dignity to his Language, but by such means as these.
1.
By changing the Name with the Definition, as occasion shall serve.
As when the Name shall be indecent, by using the Definition;
or Contrary.
2.
By Metaphors.3.
By using the plural number for the singular.
4. By privative Epithets.
ELOCUTIONS are made Decent,1.
By speaking feelingly;
that is, with such Passion as is fit for the matter he is in;
as Angerly in matter of Injury.2.
By speaking as becomes the Person of the Speaker;
as for a Gentleman to speak eruditely.
3.
By speaking proportionably to the matter;
as of great affairs to speak in a high ;
and of mean, in a low Stile.
4.
By abstaining from Compounded, and from Outlandish words;
unless a Man speak passionately, and have already moved, and, as it were, inebriated his Hearers.
Or Ironically.
It confers also to perswasion very much, to use these ordin­ ary Forms of speaking, All men know;
, Tis confessed by all;
No Man will deny, and the like.
For the Hearer consents, surprized with the fear to be esteemed the only Ignorant Man.
'
Tis good also, having used a word that signifies more than the matter requires, to abstain from the Pronunciation and Countenance that to such a word belongs:
that the Dispro­ portion between it and the matter may the less appear.
And when a Man has said too much, it will shew well to correct himself:
for he will get belief by seeming to consider what he says.
[But in this a Man must have a care not to be too precise in shewing of this Consideration.
For the ostentation of I Carefulness is an argument oftentimes of lying;
as may be observed in such as tell particularities not easily observed, when they would be thought to speak more precise truth than is required.]
THERE be two sorts of Stiles.
The one continued or to be comprehended at once;
the other divided, or distinguished by Periods.
The first sort was in use with antient Writers:
but is now out of date.
An Example of this Stile is in the History of Herodotus;
wherein there is no Period till the end of the whole History.
In the other kind of Stile, that is distinguished by Periods;
a Period is such a part as is perfect in it self, and has such length as may easily be comprehended by the understanding.
This later kind is pleasant;
the former unpleasant, because this appears finite, the other infinite:
in this the Hearer has always somewhat set out, and terminated to him;
in the other he fore-sees no end, and has nothing finished to him ;
this may easily be committed to memory, because of the measure and cadence (which is the cause that Verses be easily remem­ bered) ;
the other not.
Every Sentence ought to end with the period, and nothing to be interposed.
Period is either simple, or divided into Parts.
Simple is that which is Indivisible;
as, I wonder you fear not their ends, whose actions you imitate.
A Period divided, is that which not only has perfection and length convenient, for respiration, but also Parts.
As, I won­ der you are not afraid of their ends, seeing you imitate their actions:
where in these words, I wonder you are not afraid of their ends, is one Colon, or Part;
and in these, Seeing you imitate their actions, another:
and both together make the Period.
The parts, or members, and periods of speech ought neither to be too long, nor too short.
Too long are they, which are produced beyond the expect­ ation of the Hearer.
Too short are they, that end before he expects it.
Those that be too long, leave the Hearer behind, like him that walking, goes beyond the usual end of the Walk, and thereby out-goes him that walks with him.
They that be too short, make the Hearer stumble;
for when he looks far before him, the end stops him before he be aware.
A period that is divided into parts, is either divided only;
or has also an Opposition of the Parts one to another.
Divided only is such as this:
This the Senate knows;
the Consul sees;
and yet the Man lives.
A Period with Opposition of Parts, called also Antithesis, and the parts Antitheta, is when contrary parts are put toge­ ther ;
or also joyned by a third.
Contrary parts are put together, as here, The one has ob­ tained Glory, the other Riches;
both by my benefit.
Antitheta are therefore acceptable;
because not only the parts appear the better for the opposition;
but also for that they carry with them a certain appearance of that kind of En­ thymeme, which leads to Impossibility,Parts, or Members of a Period, are said to be equal, when they have altogether, or almost equal Number of Syllables.
Parts, or Members of a Period, are said to be like, when they begin, or end alike:
and the more Similitudes, and the greater equality there is of Syllables, the more graceful is the Period.
FORASMUCH as there is nothing more delightful to a Man, than to find that he apprehends and learns easily ;
it neces­ sarily follows, that those Words are most grateful to the Ear, that make a Man seem to see before his Eyes the things sig­ nified.
And therefore Forraign Words are unpleasant, because Obscure;
and Plain Words, because too Manifest, making us learn nothing new:
but Metaphors please;
for they beget in us by the Genus, or some common thing to that with another, a kind of Science:
as when an Old Man is called Stubble;
a Man suddenly learns that he grows up, flourisheth, and withers like Grass, being put in mind of it by the qualities common to Stubble, and to Old Men.
That which a Metaphor does, a Similitude does the same;
but with less grace, because with more prolixity.
Such
Enthymemes are the most graceful, which neither are presently very Manifest, nor yet very hard to be understood 1, but are comprehended, while they are uttering, or presently after, though not understood before.
The things that make a speech graceful, are these;
Anti­ theta, Metaphors, and Animation.
Of Antitheta and Antithesis hath been spoken in the prece­ dent Chapter.
Of Metaphors the most graceful is that which is drawn from Proportion.
[Aristotle (in the 12 Chapter of his Poetry) defines a Me­ taphor to be the translation of a name from one signifi­ cation to another ;
whereof he makes four kinds:
1. From the General to the Particular.
2. From the Particular to the General.
3. From one Particular to another.
4. From Proportion.]
A Metaphor from Proportion is such as this, A State with­ out Youth, is a Year without a Spring.
Animation is that expression which makes us seem to see the thing before our eyes;
as he that said, The Athenians poured out their City into Sicily, meaning, they sent thither the greatest Army they could make;
and this is the greatest grace of an Oration.
If therefore in the same Sentence there concur both Meta­ phor, and this Animation, and also Antithesis, it cannot choose but be very graceful.
That an Oration is graced by Metaphor, Animation, and Antithesis, hath been said:
but how 'tis graced, is to be said in the next Chapter.'
Tis graced by Animation, when the actions of living Crea­ tures are attributed to things without life;
as when the Sword is said to devour.
Such Metaphors as these come into a Mans mind by the observation of things that have similitude and proportion one to another.
And the more unlike and unproportionable the things be otherwise, the more grace hath the Metaphor.
A Metaphor without Animation, adds grace then, when the Hearer finds he learns somewhat by such use of the word.
Also Paradoxes are graceful, so Men inwardly do believe them:
for they have in them somewhat like to those jests that are grounded upon the similitude of words, which have usually one sense, and in the present another;
and somewhat like to those jests which are grounded upon the deceiving of a Mans expectation.
And Paragrams;
that is, allusions of words are graceful, if they be well placed;
and in Periods not too long ;
and with Antithesis;
for by these means the ambiguity is taken away.
And the more of these;
namely, Metaphor, Animation, Antithesis, Equality of Members, a Period hath, the more graceful it is.
Similitudes grace an Oration, when they contain also a Metaphor.
And Proverbs are graceful, because they are Metaphors, or Translations of words from one species to another.
And Hyperboles, because they also are Metaphors:
but they are youthful, and bewray vehemence;
and are used with most grace by them that are angry;
and for that cause are not comely in Old Men.THE
Stile that should be Read ought to be more exact and accurate.
But the Stile of a Pleader ought to be suited to Action and Pronuntiation.
Orations of them that Plead, pass away with the hearing.
But those that are Written, Men carry about them, and are considered at leisure;
and consequently must endure to be sifted and examined.
Written Orations appear flat in Pleading.
And Orations made for the Barr, when the Action is away, appear in Reading insipide.
In Written Orations Repetition is justly condemned.
But in Pleadings,. by the help of Action, and by some change in the Pleader, Repetition becomes Amplification.
In Written Orations Disjunctives do ill;
as, I came, Iffound him, I asked him:
for they seem superfluous, and but one thing, because they are not distinguished by Action.
But in Pleadings 'tis Amplification;
because that which is but one thing, is made to seem many.
Of Pleadings, that which is Judicial ought to be more ac­ curate, than that which is before the people.
And an Oration to the people ought to be more accommodate to Action, than a Judicial.
And of Judicial Orations, that ought to be more accurate, which is uttered to few Judges ;
and that ought to be more accommodate to Action, which is uttered to many.
As in a Picture, the farther he stands off that beholds it, the less need there is that the Colours be fine:
so in Orations, the farther the Hearer stands off, the less need there is for his Oration to be elegant.
Therefore Demonstrative Orations are most proper for Writing, the end whereof is to Read.
THE necessary Parts of an Oration are but two;
Proposi­ tions, and Proof;
which are as it were the Probleme, and Demonstration.
The Proposition is the explication, or opening of the Mat­ ter to be proved.
And Proof is the Demonstration of the Matter propounded.
To these necessary parts, are sometimes added two other, the Proeme and the Epilogue, neither of which are any Proof.
So that in some there be four parts of an* Oration;
the .
Preme, the Proposition, or (as the others call it) the Narra­ tion, the Proofs, (which contain Confirmation, Confutation, Amplification, and Diminution,) and the Epilogue.
THE Proeme is the beginning of an Oration, and, as it were, the preparing of the way before one enter into it.
In some kinds of Orations it resembles the Prelude of Mu­ sicians, who first play what they list, and afterwards the Tune they intended.
In other kinds it resembles the Prologue of a Play, that contains the Argument.
Proemes of the first sort, are most proper for Demonstrative Orations;
in which a Man is free to foretell, or not, what points he will insist upon;
and for the most part 'tis better not:
because when a Man has not obliged himself to a certain matter, Digression will seem Variety:
but if he have ingaged himself, Variety will be accounted Digression.
In Demonstratives the matter of the Proeme consisteth in the Praise or Dispraise of some Law or Custom, or in Ex­ hortation, or Dehortation ;
or something that serves to incline the Hearer to the purpose.
Proemes of the second kind are most proper for Judicial Orations.
For as the Prologue in a Dramatick, and the Exor­ dium in an Epique Poem, setteth first in few words the Argu­ ment of the Poem:
so in a Judicial Oration the Orator ought to exhibit a Model of his Oration, that the mind of the Hearer may not be suspended, and for want of fore-sight, err or wander.
Whatsoever else belongs to a Proeme, is drawn from one of these four;
From the Speaker, From the Adversary, From the Hearer, or from the Matter.
From the Speaker and Adversary are drawn into Proemes such Criminations and Purgations as belong not to the cause.
To the Defendant 'tis necessary in the Proeme to answer to the accusations of his Adversary ;
that those being cleared, he may have a more favourable entrance to the rest of his Oration.
But to the Plaintife 'tis better to cast his Criminations all into the Epilogue, that the Judge may the more easily re­ member them.
From the Hearer and from the Matter are drawn into the Proeme such things as serve to make the Hearer favourable, or angry;
attentive, or not attentive, as need shall require.
And Hearers use to be attentive to persons that are reputed good;
to things that are of great Consequence, or that concern themselves, or that are strange, or that delight.
But to make the Hearer attentive, is not the part of the Proeme only, but of any other part of the Oration, and rather of any other part, than of the Proeme.
For the Hearer is every where more remiss than in the beginning.
And there­ fore wheresoever there is need, the Orator must make appear both the probity of his own person, and that the matter in.
hand is of great Consequence;
or that it concerns the Hearer;
or that it is new;
or that it is delightful.
He that will have the Hearer attentive to him, but not to the Cause, must on the other side make it seem that the matter is a trifle, without relation to the Hearer, common, and tedious.
That the Hearer may be favourable to the Speaker, one of two things is required;
that he love him, or that he pity him.
In Demonstrative Orations, he that praises shall have the Hearer favourable if he think himself, or his own manners, or course of life, or any thing he loves, comprehended in the same praise.
On the contrary, he that dispraises, shall be heard favour­ ably, if the Hearer find his Enemies, or their courses, or any thing he hates, involved in the same dispraise.
The Proeme of a Deliberative Oration is taken from the same things, from which are taken the Proemes of Judicial Orations.
For the matter of a Deliberative Oration needeth not that natural Proeme, by which is shewn what we are to speak of;
for that is already known:
the Proeme in these, being made only for the Speakers, or Adversaries sake;
or to make the Matter appear great, or little, as one would have it, and is therefore to be taken from the persons of the Plaintif or Defendant;
or from the Hearer, or from the Matter, as in Orations Judicial.1.
ONE is from the removal of ill Opinion in the Hearer, imprinted in him by the Adversary, or otherwise.
2.
Another from this,
That the thing done is not hurtful, or not to him, or not so much, or not unjust, or not great, or not dishonourable,3.
A third from the Recompence, as, I did him harm, but withal I did him honour.4.
A fourth -from the Excuse;
as, It was Errour, Mis­ chance, or Constraint.5.
A fifth from the Intention;
as, One thing was done, another meant.
6.
A sixth from the Comprehension of the Accuser;
as, What I have done, the Accuser has done the same;
or his Father, Kinsman, or Friend.7.
From the Comprehension of those that are in Reputa­ tion;
as, What I did, such and such have done the same, who nevertheless are good Men.8.
From Comparison with such as have been falsely accused, or wrongfully suspected, and nevertheless found upright.
9.
From Recrimination ;
as, The Accuser is a man of ill life, and therefore not to be believed.
10.
From that the Judgment belongs to another Place, or Time ;
as, I have already answered, or am to answer else­ where to this Matter.
11.
From Crimination of the Crimination;
as, It serves only to pervert Judgment.
12.
A twelfth, which is common both to Crimination and Purgation, and is taken from some sign ;
as Teucer is not to be believed, because his Mother was Priam's Sister.
On the other side, Teucer is to be believed, because his Father was Priam's Enemy.
13.
A thirteenth, proper to Crimination only, from praise and dispraise mixt:
as, To praise small things, and blame great ones;
or to praise in many words, and blame with ef­ fectual ones;
or to praise many things that are good, and then add one evil, but a great one.
14.
A fourteenth, coming both to Crimination and Purga­ tion, is taken from the interpretation of the fact:
for he that purgeth himself interpreteth the fact always in the best sense;
and he that Criminates, always in the worst;
as when Ulysses said, Diomedes chose him for his Companion, as the most able of the Grecians, to aid him in his exploit:
but his Adversary said, He chose him for his cowardice, as the most unlikely to share with him in the Honour.
THE Narration is not always continued and of one Piece;
but sometimes, as in Demonstratives, interrupted, and dispers­ ed through the whole Oration.
For there being in a Narration something that falls not under Art;
as namely, the Actions themselves, which the Orator inventeth not;
he must therefore bring in the Nar­ ration of them where he best may.
As for Example, if being to praise a Man, you would make a Narration of all his Acts immediately from the beginning, and without interruption, you will find it necessary afterwards to repeat the same Acts again, while from some of them you praise his Valour, and from others his Wisdom:
whereby your Oration shall have less variety, and shall less please.
'Tis not necessary always that the Narration be short.
The true measure of it must be taken from the matter that is to be laid open.
In the Narration, as oft as may be, 'tis good to insert some­ what commendable in ones self, and blameable in ones Adver­ sary :
As, I advised him but he would take no Counsel.
In Narrations, a Man is to leave out whatsoever breeds compassion, indignation in the Hearer besides the purpose;
as Ulysses in Homer, relating his Travels to Alcinous, to move compassion in him, is so long in it, that it consists of divers Books:
but when he comes home, tells the same to his Wife in thirty Verses, leaving out what might make her sad.
The Narration ought also to be in such words as argue the Manners;
that is, some virtuous or vicious habit in him of whom we speak, although it be not exprest;
As, setting his Arms a kenbold, he answered, etc. by which is insinuated the pride of him that so answered.
In an Oration a Man does better to shew his affection than his Judgment:
that is, 'Tis better to say, I like this;
than to say, This is better.
For by the one you would seem wise, by the other good.
But Favour follows Goodness;
whereas Wis­ dom procures Envy.
But if this Affection seem incredible, then either a reason must be rendered, as did Antigone.
For when she had said, She loved her brother better than her Husband or Children ;
she added, for Husband and Children I may have more;
but another Brother I cannot, my Parents being both dead.
Or else a man must use this form of speaking;
I know this affection of mine seems strange to you;
but nevertheless it is such.
For 'tis not easily believed, that any Man has a mind to do any thing that is not for his own good.
Besides in a Narration, not only the Actions themselves;
but the Passions, and signs that accompany them, are to be discovered.
And in his Narration a Man should make himself and his Adversary be considered for such, and such, as soon, and as covertly as he can.
A
Narration may have need sometimes not to be in the beginning.
In Deliberative Orations;
that is, where soever the question is of things to come ;
a Narration, which is always of things past, has no place:
and yet things past may be recounted, that Men may deliberate better of the future:
But that is not as Narration, but Proof;
for 'tis Example.
There may also be Narration in Deliberatives in that part where Crimination and Praise come in:
But that part is not Deliberative, but Demonstrative.
PROOFS are to be applyed to something controverted.
The Controv.ersie in Judicial Oration is,
Whether it has been done;
whether it has been hurtful;
whether the matter be so great, and whether it be Just, or no.
In a question of Fact, one of the Parties of necessity is faulty, (for ignorance of the Fact is no excuse,) and therefore the Fact is chiefly to be insisted on.
In Demonstratives, the Fact for the most part is supposed:
but the honour and profit of the Fact are to be proved.
In Deliberatives, the question is,
Whether the thing be like to be, or likely to be so great:
or whether it be just;
or whe­ ther it be profitable.
Besides the application of the Proof to the question, a Man ought to observe, whether his Adversary have lyed in any point without the Cause.
For 'tis a sign he does the same in the Cause.
The Proofs themselves are either Examples, or Enthymemes.
A Deliberative Oration, because 'tis of things to come, re­ quireth rather Examples, than Enthymemes.
But a Judicial Oration, being of things past, which have a necessity in them, and may be concluded syllogistically, re­ quireth rather Enthymemes.
Enthymemes ought not to come too thick together, for they hinder one anothers force by confounding the Hearer.
Nor ought a Man to endeavour to prove every thing by Enthymeme, least like some Philosophers, he collect what is known, from what is less known.
Nor ought a Man to use Enthymemes, when he would move the Hearer to some affection:
For seeing divers Motions do mutually destroy or weaken one another, he will lose either the Enthymeme, or the affection that he would move.
For the same reason, a Man ought not to use Enthymemes when he would express Manners.
But whether he would move affection, or insinuate his Manners, he may withal use Sentences.
A Deliberative Oration is more difficult than a Judicial, because 'tis of the future, whereas a Judicial is, of that which is past, and that consequently may be known;
and because it has principles, namely the Law;
and it is easier to prove from principles, than without.
Besides, a Deliberative Oration wants those helps of turning to the Adversary ;
of speaking of himself;
of raising passion.
He therefore that wants matter in a' Deliberative Oration, let him bring in some person to praise or dispraise.
And in Demonstratives he that has nothing to say in com­ mendation or discommendation of the principal party, let him praise or dispraise some body else, as his Father, or Kinsman, or the very vertues or vices themselves.
He that wants not Proofs, let him not only prove strongly, but also insinuate his Manners:
but he that has no Proof let him nevertheless insinuate his Manners.
For a good Man is as acceptable, as an exact Oration.
Of Proofs, those that lead to an absurdity, please better than those that are direct or ostensive ;
because from the com- parison of Contraries, namely, Truth and Falsity, the force of the Syllogisme does the better appear.
Confutation is also a part of Proof.
And he that speaks first, puts it after his own Proofs, unless the Controversie contain many and different matters.
And he that speaks last, puts it before.
For 'tis necessary to make way for his own Oration, by removing the Objections of him that spake before.
For the mind abhors both the Man, and his Oration, that is damned before hand.
If a Man desire his Manners should appear well, (least speaking of himself he become odious, or troublesome, or obnoxious to obtrectation;
or speaking of another, he seem contumelious, or scurrilous,) let him introduce another person.
Last of all, least he cloy his Hearer with Enthymemes, let him vary them sometimes with Sentences;
but such as have the same force.
As here is an Enthymeme.
If it be then the best time to make peace when the best conditions of peace may be had, then the time is now, while our Fortune is entire.
And this is a Sentence of equal force to it.
Wise Men make peace, while their Fortune is entire.
THE times wherein 'tis fit to ask ones Adversary a question are chiefly four.
1.
The first is, when of two Propositions that conclude an Absurdity, he has already uttered one;
and we would by Interrogation draw him to confess the other.
2.
The second, when of two Propositions that conclude an Absurdity, one is manifest of it self, and the other likely to be fetched out by a question;
then the Interrogation will be seasonable;
and the absurd Conclusion is presently to be in­ ferred, without adding that Proposition which is manifest.
3.
The third, when a Man would make appear that his Adversary does contradict himself.
4.
The fourth, when a Man would take from his Adversary such shifts as these, In some sort His so;
In some sort His not so.
Out of these Cases 'tis not fit to interrogate.
For he whose question succeeds not, is thought vanquished.
To equivocal questions a Man ought to answer fully, and not to be too brief.
To Interrogations which we fore-see tend to draw from us an Answer, contrary to our purpose, we must, together with our Answer, presently give an Answer to the objection which is implyed in the Question.
And where the Question exacteth an Answer that con­ cludeth against us, we must together with our Answer pre­ sently distinguish.
Jests are dissolved by serious and grave discourse:
and grave discourse is deluded by Jests.
The several kinds of Jests are set down in the Art of Poetry.
Whereof one kind is Ironia, and tends to please ones self.
The other is Scurrility, and tends to please others.
The latter of these has in it a kind of baseness;
the former may become a Man of good breeding.
THE Peroration must consist of one of these four things.
Inclining the Judge to favour yourself, or to disfavour your Adversary.
For then, when all has been said respecting the cause, is the best season to praise, or dispraise the Parties.
Of Amplification or Diminution.
For when it appears what is good or evil, then is the time to shew how great, or how little that good or evil is.
Or in moving the Judge to Anger, Love, or other Passion.
For when it is manifest of what kind, and how great the good or evil is, then it will be opportune to excite the Judge.
Or of Repetition, that the Judge may remember what has been said.
Repetition consisteth in the matter, and the manner.
For the Orator must shew, that he has performed what he pro­ mised in the beginning of his Oration, and how:
namely, by comparing his Arguments one by one with his Adversaries, repeating them in the same order they were spoken.

Does the προαίρεσις characterize all actions which men do εὶδότες?
Must the accuser consider the τίνων, καὶ πόσων ἒνεκα, or the inducement, to exist in his adversary ?
What are the efficient causes of those actions which men do not δί αὑτοὑς ?
Of this class of actions which men do not δί avrovc, but έξ ἀνάγκης, what are the specific causes which Aristotle mentions ?
What are the efficient causes of those actions which men do δί αὑτος ?
Into how many species does Aristotle divide the ὂρεξις ?
Mention the logical differences, which, when added to the genus ὂρεξις, give the species βούλησις, όργὴ, and έπιθυμία ?
Enumerate the seven causes of actions.
Can the ὴλικίαι and ἒξεις be called the true causes of human actions ?
Have they their consequences which when added to the true causes give additional weight to the argument ?
Why does Aristotle omit to treat of the ὴλικίαι and ἒξεις under the judicial species ?
Does Aristotle infer, from the definitions of the seven causes of human actions, the ends of the agents? (chap. x. 12, 13, 14, et seq.)
From which of the seven causes of actions does he infer the ends of those actions which men do δί αὐτοὑς ?
When Aristotle says, that all such things as men do δί αὑ­ τοὐς are real or apparent goods, why does he make the dis­ tinction of " real" and " apparent"?
Am I then to understand that all things which men do willingly, and consequently all things which they do unjustly, are really or apparently good, and really or apparently plea­ sant, and that these are the ὦν ἒνεκαἀδικου̃σι?
With what view has Aristotle introduced the συμφέρον in the judicial species of oration, when he had previously con­ sidered it as the τὸ τέλος of the deliberative ? (chap. x. 19.)
Do I understand you to say, that he introduces it because it is the end of human action ?
You have before stated that the εὐδαιμονία was the σκόπος of human pursuit, and now state that the συμφέρον and ἀγαθὸν are the τὸ τέλος of actions;
explain the meaning of the words σκόπος and τέλος.
Give the definition of ὴδονὴ and λύπη.
How would you infer the definition of the ὴδύ and λυπηρόν ?
Are these definitions the στοιχεĩα from which Aristotle de­ duces the εἲδη in this chapter ?
Why does Aristotle refer the discussion of the δυνατὸν πραχθη̃ναι to the second book of Rhetoric? .Explain why the second part of the division, viz.
έαυτοĩς δυνατὸν, should belong more especially to the judicial .species, when the δυνατὸν πραχθη̃ναι is considered as a τόπος,To what things do those persons trust who rely on the punishment being less than the gain, if detected?
(third member of the subdivision.)
Enumerate the things to which those persons trust who hope to escape punishment if detected:
(second member of the subdivision.)
Why should right and wrong be defined in reference to two kinds of law ?
Why is the twofold distinction of persons (πρὸς οὒς) in refer­ ence to whom right and wrong is defined, necessary ? (3.)How many species of law does Aristotle enumerate ?
What do you understand by the νόμος κοινὸς ?
From whence does Aristotle infer this definition ? (chap. x. 3.)
What is the threefold division which Aristotle makes of έγκλήματα, or accusation ?
In what kind of cases do men, generally and specifically speaking, manifest the προαίρεσις in action?
(chap. x. 4.)
Is it necessary for an accuser to lay great stress on the προαίρεσις ?
Under what circumstances, or with what dispositions, do men act by deliberative choice?
(chap. xii.
1.)Do you consider that the depravity and injustice of an act is manifested by the προαίρεσις of the agent ?
How many distinctions of right and wrong (δικαία k'at ἀγαθὰ) are there ?
Why is this twofold distinction made ?
Into how many species does Aristotle divide the subaltern genus ἂγραφα ?
Can you give a reason why the species " remarkably virtu­ ous and vicious," (ra μὲν καθ' ὑπερβολὴν, &c.,) is not included in the written law ?
When Solon was asked why he had not enacted a special law against parricide, what was his answer ?
Does not this answer give the reason why ἂδικα of this spe­ cies are not included in the written law ἐκόντων τω̃ννομοθετω̃ν ?
Mention some virtues, which as falling under the species καθ' ὑπερβολὴν, &c., are not noticed in written laws ?
Is it because they are so universally acknowledged and re­ quired, that they are not noticed in written laws ?
What is the cause of this defect in the written law of states ?
Give the definition of equity.
What is the standard by which the degrees in criminality may be ascertained?
With what view does Aristotle infer εἲδη, όσὰ ay ῇ ἀπὸ μείζ
ονος ἀδικίας ?
(vide chap. ix. 39, with respect to the αὒξησις, and Book ii. 26.)What kind of injuries are comparatively the more severely felt?
You stated in reply to questions in the first book, (chap. x.) that κακία generally, and ἀκρασία specifically, were the causes of acts of injustice characterized by the προαίρεσις, how then would you ascertain the comparative enormity of ἀδικήματα ? (vide Annotationes Schrader.)
Are ἀδικήματα of this description estimated by the hurt done, or the προαίρεσις of the agent ?
(xii.
5.)If the hurt done be irremediable, is the act of injustice capable of being amplified ?
Am I then to understand that ἀδικήματα which are irreme­ diable, incapable of being adequately punished, of being re­ venged, which are done frequently, and έκ προνοίας may be considered μείζονα ?
Into how many species is the distinction νόμοι subdivided ?
Into how many subaltern genera is the distinction μάρτυρες (chap. xv. 13) divided?
Into how many subaltern species is the subaltern genus παλαιοὶ μάρτυρες subdivided ?
Is the lowest species to the subaltern species, (περὶ μὲν τω̃ν γενομένων,) viz. poets and illustrious men, most adapted to the judicial species of oration ?
Is the lowest species to the subaltern species, (περὶ μὲv οὖν τω̃ν έσομένων,) viz.
soothsayers, oracles, and proverbs, equally serviceable in the deliberative as in the judicial species of oration ?
Into how many subaltern species is the subaltern genus μάρτυρες πρόσφατοι divided? (chap. xv. 13.)What kind of persons constitute the lowest species to the subaltern species (οὶ δὲ ἐκτὸς κινδύνου) of the μάρτυρες πρόσφα­ rot? (chap. xv. 15, first line.)
Which of the two lowest species (viz. the οὶ γνώριμοι, and ot ay δόξωσι ψεύδεσθαι, or viva voce evidence,) is most entitled to credit?
Aristotle has hitherto treated of the different kinds of μάρτυες, and he then proceeds to consider the manner in which their credit is to be amplified and extenuated by the orator ;
if the orator then has no witnesses to support his case, by what arguments must he diminish the credit of testimony ? (chap. xv. 17.)To what circumstances does testimony speak? (18.)Is the impeachment of the veracity of a witness by an en­ thymem (έξ εὶκότων) a solid objection to his testimony ?
Am I then to understand, that if the orator has no testi­ mony to adduce, be must,1st.
Insist on the propriety of the judge deciding, γνώμη τῃ̃ ἀρίστῃ. (vide Book I. chap. xv. 5, 12, 17. Book II. chap. xxv. 10.)2nd.
That εἲκοτα are better than witnesses, as they are never open to corruption.3rd.
That εἲκοτα are never convicted of falsehood ?
If the orator has witnesses to support his case, by what arguments should he corroborate their testimony, and extenu­ ate the εἲκοτα ?
What two precepts does Aristotle give with respect to the extenuation and amplification of the συνθη̃και and ράσανοι ?
What is the fourfold division with respect to oaths ?
IN treating of the judicial species of oration, what does Aristotle propose that the orator should first consider in his accusation ?
If the question be simply whether his adversary has com­ mitted an injury, the orator must prove,-what ? (chap. x. 2.)
If an act of injustice has been committed, but that act of injustice has not been defined by the written law, under which species of law must he prove his case ? (chap. xiii. 14 ;
xv. 4.)Am I then to understand, that in inquiring whether his adversary has committed an act of injustice, the orator's first business is to prove that he has acted for some end;
secondly, that he was a likely person to commit it;
and thirdly, that the object injured was a person likely to be injured ?
Are these the three general points which he must prove against his adversary ?
What is the specific point he must prove against his ad­ versary ?
Why is the general question, Whether the adversary has committed an act of injustice, (chap. x. xi. xii.) and the spe­ cific question, Whether he has acted unjustly, (chap. xiii.) distinguished ?
(vide chap. x. 7.)To prove that his adversary has acted unjustly against the state, or a private individual, what must the orator urge against his adversary ?
(chap. xiii.
7.)If the act is clearly done by a voluntary agent, on what principle must the orator prove his adversary to have acted ?
(chap. xiii.
7.)If the act is clearly done by deliberative choice, what is the next question an orator must prove against his adversary?
(chap. xiii.
9.)To prove simply that his adversary has acted unjustly, how many specific questions arise for the orator's consideration ?
Are they not three ?
Ist.
Whether he has violated the written law?
(chap. xiii. 9.)2nd.
If he has not violated the written law, whether he has acted with depravity so excessive as not to be de­ fined by the written law ? (chap. xiii. 12.)3rd.
Whether he has acted in violation of equity ? (chap. xiii. 12, 13.)You stated in reply to questions in the first book, that Aris­ totle, had made three distinctions of πίστεις, viz. at'a του̃ ἤθους, διὰ τω̃ν ἀκροατω̃ν, διὰ τω̃ν λόγων:
which of these three distinc­ tions has he already treated of, and which is he now proceed­ ing to discuss ?
What is the end of Rhetoric, or the object which an orator in speaking has always in view ?
(vide Annotationes, chap. i. 2.)
How does the investment of one's self with moral character effect persuasion in the auditor ?
(vide Schrader's note, 1, 3.)Must the qualifications by which the speaker invests him­ self with moral character, be perceived from the speech as existing in him, (vide Book I. chap. ii. 4,) or known to have existed in him before ?
From the three distinctions of πίστεις, what do you infer to be the three great accomplishments of a perfect orator ?
Do I understand you to say, proof by enthymem, invest­ ment of himself with moral character, and the excitement of the passions in his auditors ?
What are the three causes of a speaker's effecting persua­ sion through moral character ?
If a speaker appears to be a man capable of imparting be­ nefits to the state, does he effect persuasion through moral character, by his virtue ?
(vide chap. ix. 4, definition of virtue.)
When Demosthenes in the oration for the crown makes use of the following words,­ to which distinction of πίστεις does he recur, and through which of the causes φϱόνησις, ἀρετὴ, or εὔνοια, does he endea­ vour to effect persuasion ?
What are the three questions which Aristotle proposes for consideration in treating of the passions ?
(Book II.
chap. i. 9.)With what view was this threefold division necessary ?
Is it possible to obtain τόποι calculated for the excitement of the passions without a knowledge of these three questions proposed by Aristotle ?
(Book II.
chap. i. 9.)Give the. definition of anger.
Is this definition proposed as a στοιχει̃ον from which the τόποι are afterwards inferred ?
Does not Aristotle explain this definition by two proposi­ tions, viz.1st.
Anger is against some individual on account of con­ tempt to one's self or friends.2nd.
Pain is not so much the consequent of anger as a certain pleasure ?
Explain the reference which these two explanatory propo­ sitions have to the definition of anger.
To what cause do you attribute the sensation of pain in anger ?
To what causes (which are two) do you attribute the sensa­ tion of pleasure in anger ?
Can you give any other reasons why pleasure should be a consequent?
(Book I. chap. x. 17, 18;
chap. xi. 10, 12, 13.)Could you infer a reason from the definition of ἡδόνη in the first book ?
Is the ἡ ὀργὴ a generic or specific term ?
Under what generic term do you class the ἡ ὀργὴ ?
What is the object of anger ?
What is the cause of anger ?
How many species of the ὀλιγωρία are there ?
Does not Aristotle prove that the καταφϱόνησις is a species of ὀλιγωρία from the definition of ὀλιγωϱία ?
Explain how Aristotle from its own definition proves the ἐπηρεασμὸς to be a distinct species of ὀλιγωϱία.
Is slight attended with a certain pleasure ?
You have before stated in reply to questions in the former book, that all actions done by men ἑκόντες are ἀγαθὰ ἦ φαινό­ μενα ἀγαθὰ, ἢ ἡδέα ἢ φαινόμενα ἡδέα:
can you show that if the ὀλιγωρία be a voluntary act, it must be consequently δύ ἢ φαινόμενον ἡδύ ?
To what cause do you attribute the pleasure which the o ὑβϱίζων feels ?
How then are men affected when they feel anger ?
With what kind of persons do they feel angry ?
What are the causes of this passion ?
What is it incumbent on the orator to prove, to excite an­ ger against his adversary ?
What kind of person must he prove his adversary to be, to merit anger ?
When Æschines uses the following arguments in his ora­ tion against Ctesiphon, does he endeavour to excite anger against Demosthenes ?
and by which of the causes ὀλιγωϱία, or its species, does he endeavour to excite it against his ad­ versary ?
As the ἡ πράϋνσις is the contrary to the ἡ ὀργὴ, and the τόποι are therefore inferred ratione contrariorum, it will be necessary to propose many questions on this chapter.
What is the definition of the ἡ πϱάϋνσις ?
You stated in reply to a former question, that pain and pleasure were consequent to the ra πάθη and σημει̃α of the ἡ βούλησις, (chap. iv.)
but are they both consequent to the ἡ πράϋνσις, and which is the σημει̃ον of the βούλησις in this passion ?
What is the definition of the τὸ φιλει̃ν ?
Can you infer from this definition that a friend is perceived from the indications of the ἡ βούλησις ?
How many species of the ἡ φίλια are there ? (28.)What are the causes which give occasion to the ἡ φίλια ?
What is the difference between the ἡ ὀργὴ and the ἡ ἔχθϱα ?
How many differences does Aristotle enumerate ?
How many, and what are the causes of the ἡ ἔχθρα which Aristotle enumerates ? (30.)
You have stated that the ἡ ὀργὴ is felt on account of the ἡ ὀλιγωρία and its species ;
but if a man is habitually addicted to the ἡ ὀλιγωϱία and its species, are our sentiments those of the ἡ ὀργὴ or ἡ ἔχθρα ?
Do anger and hatred ever differ with respect to the objects against whom they are felt ?
(xxxi. line 3, 4.)
Can you class both these passions under the genus ὀρέξεις ἄλογοι ?
Does the sensation of the ἡ λύπη accompany the ἔχθϱα ? (xxxi. line 10.)
Which of the two passions, the ἡ ὀϱγὴ and the ἡ ἔχθϱα, does Aristotle consider as incurable ?
You stated in a former chapter that the ἡ τιμωρία was the object of the ἡ ὀργὴ, what is the object of the ἡ ἔχθρα?(xxxi. line 6.)What kind of person will an orator describe his adversary to be, when he endeavours to excite feelings of hatred against him in his auditors ?
Give the definition of the ὁ φόβος.
Does it follow from this definition that all the τὰ κακὰ are the objects of the ὁφόβος?
Is it absolutely necessary for the sensation of the ὁφόβος that the evil should be close at hand ?
Can you mention any circumstances, or characters in life, which excite the ὁφὁβος in others?
(vii. et seq.)
What is the reason that men are not afraid of such evils as death ?
,Am I to understand that some hope of safety is essential in the sensation of the ὁφὁβος ? (xiv.)Is deliberation also essential in the sensation of the ὁ φόβος ?
If the r'a κακὰ be of such a description as to annihilate all hope of safety, and prevent all deliberation in the sufferer, what is the τὸ πάθος which under such circumstances is felt ?
In what chief respects do the sensations of the o φόβος and TO δεινὸν differ ?.
Do I understand you to say, " In the feeling of hope and anxiety, and excitement of deliberation, which accompany the one, but are annihilated in the other ?
"Do they differ also in any other remarkable respect ? (chap. v. 12, line 4;
chap. viii. 13, line 4.)Do I understand you to say, " In the sensation of the ὁἔλεος if.
the τὰ κακὰ were to happen to others and not to ourselves ?
"Is the difference discoverable in the case of Amasis ?
Give the definition of the τὸ ϑαῤῥεῑν.
What is the twofold division which Aristotle makes of the men who feel the τὸ ϑάρσος ? (xviii.)
What illustration does Aristotle give in support of this dis­ tinction ?
To which of the three species of oration do you consider appeals to the ὁφόβος most peculiar ?
Give me a reason why you consider them most peculiar to the εἲδος συμβουλευτικὸν. (Confer Book I. chap. iii. 4, with the definition of the ὁφόβος.)
In which of the three species do you consider appeals to the ἡ ὀργὴ, ὁφθόνος, and ὁἔλεος, most likely to occur ?
Does Aristotle approve of such appeals to the ὁ δικαστη̃ς ?
(Book i. chap. i. 5.)Give the definition of the αἰσχύνη.
Do only acts of depravity, or do the σημει̃α of such specific vices as illiberality, flattery, &c., ever excite the ἡ αἰσχύνη ?
Give the definition of the ἡ χάϱις.
Has this word two distinct significations ? (vide Schrader Annotationes.)
Which of these two significations is expressive of the τὸ πάθος ?
With what view does Aristotle explain the ἡ χάρις as im­ plying gratuitous benevolence ?
Is it for the purpose of showing how it may be amplified ?
What division of the αἱ ὀρέξεις does Aristotle make in this chapter ? (iii.)
To which division do you consider such ἐπιθυμίαι as hun­ ger and thirst belong ?
Is it necessary that the party benefited must be ἐν rp τοιαύτῃ δεήσει to constitute the ἡ χάϱις ?
Is it necessary that the party benefiting should assist the other ἐν τῇ τοιαύτῃ χϱεία ?
Give the definition of the ὁ ἔλεος.
What kind of persons are most sensible of the ὁ ἔλεος ?
What reason does Aristotle give that the oi ὄντες ἐν ὀργῃ̃ η̃ ϑάῤῤει do not feel the o ἔλεος ?
(vi.)Can you give another reason drawn from the definition of the ἡ ὀργὴ and ὁ e\eog ?
Can you class the ἡ ὀργὴ and 6 ἔλεος under the genus ὄρεξεις ἄλογοι ?
What kind of persons do men pity ?
Give me a reason why you except the σφόδϱα ἐγγὺς ὦσιν οἰκειόητι.
In what respects do the τὸ δεινὸν and ὁ ἔλεος differ ?
(xii.)Can you give a reason why certain characters, when repre­ sented on the stage, excite pity ?
What passion is directly opposed to the o ἔλεος ?
Can you class the ἡ νέμεσις and ὁ ἔλεος under the same genus of the τὰ πάθη ?
What is the logical difference which when added to the generic term, gives the specific terms ἡ νέμεσις and ὁ ἔλεος ? (i. line 4.)Does not Aristotle define the ἡ νέμεσις and ὁ φθόνος by a comparison of each with the ὁ ἔλεος ?
If they do not proceed from the same virtuous dispositions, could they be classed under the same genus of the τὰ πάθη ?
Is the ὁ φθόνος opposed in a measure only, or does it differ entirely from the ὁ ἔλεος ?
In what respects do they agree, and in what differ ?
Can you infer that the opposite feelings are consequent to these passions ?
What is the opposite feeling and consequent to the ὁ φθόνος ?
What is the opposite feeling and consequent to the ὁ ἔλεος ?
Do you consider that the ὁ φθόνος and ἡ νέμεσις dispossess us of pity ?
What kind of person must the orator show his adversary to be, when he wishes to excite indignation against him in his auditor ?
Can you infer from its definition that the ἡ νέμεσις is felt at the virtues ?
(viii.)
You have stated that the ἡ νέμεσις and the o ἔλεος are di­ rectly opposed to each other, and are under the same genus;
can you infer therefore, that if the ἡ νέμεσις is not felt at the virtues, the ὁ ἔλεος is not felt at the vices of others ?
Give the definition of the ὁ φθόνος.
What are the three distinct parts in this definition, which should be distinguished, to obtain a clear understanding of the τόποι ?
When Aristotle says that such persons are likely to feel envy as have equals, from which part of the definition does he infer this ro7roc ?
What kind of a person must an orator represent his adver­ sary to be when he wishes to excite the ὁ φθόνος in the judge ?
Give the definition of the ὁ ζη̃λος.
Does the ὁ ζη̃λος differ from the ὁ φθόνος ?
In what respects do they differ ?
Can the ὁ ζη̃λος be felt at the vices of others ?
To what genus of the τὰ πάθη does the ὁ ζη̃λος belong ? (i. line 5.)
Is the ἡ καταφϱόνησις opposed only, or is it the contrary to the ὁ ζη̃λος ?
Why is it necessary that an orator should consider the τὰ ἤθη of his auditors in reference to their passions, habits, ages, and fortunes?
Does Aristotle use the expression ra ἤθη as implying only a certain disposition peculiar to men at a certain time of life, or as implying the αἱ ἕξεις, or the virtues and vices ?
Are the r'a ἤθη the effects, or are they only consequent to the αἱ ἡλίκιαι and τύχαι of men ?
You have stated that the orator should consider the r'a ἤθη of his auditors in reference to their passions, habits, &c.;
un­ der which of the three distinctions of πίστεις would you place this part of Rhetoric?
(vide Riccobon in cap. xii. hujus libri.)
Do you consider that, when Aristotle treats of the ?-a πάθη, αἱ ἕξεις, and τὰ ἤθη, he considers them to have a relation to the three species of oration ?
You stated in reply to a question in the former book, that the αἱ ἡλίκιαι and τύχαι of men were not the true causes of ac­ tions, but when added to the true causes, give additional weight to an argument in judicial inquiry, (vide Book I. chap. x.) do you consider that the orator should adapt his oration to the τὰ iOn of his auditors in reference to their passions, habits, &c., in the demonstrative and judicial species ?
What, generally speaking, are the τὰ ἤθη consequent to youth and old age ?
What are the r'a ἤθη consequent to the middle-aged ?
Why does Aristotle treat of the r'a ἤθη of the young and old before those of the middle-aged ?
What, generally speaking, are the r'a ἤθη of the noble, the rich, and the powerful1?
What reason does Aristotle adduce in this chapter for his treating of the r'a ἤθη ?
Did Aristotle treat of any ἤθη in the first book of Rhetoric?
The reader is referred to Hobbes' Brief for an exposition of the τόποι in this chapter.
Are the παράδειγμα and ἐνθύμημα common to all the species of oration ?
As Aristotle says that the παράδειγμα is like induction, ex­ plain in what points they resemble, and in what they differ.
(vide Riccobon in cap. xx. hujus libri.)
How many distinctions of παράδειγμα are there ?
Into how many species is the τὸ avrov ποιει̃ν, or matter in­ vented by the orator, subdivided ?
Explain what is meant by the species παραβολὴ ?
Which of the two distinctions of the παράδειγμα do you consider most persuasive in deliberative oratory ?
If the orator has not enthymems at command, how does Aristotle recommend him to use the παράδειγμα ?
But if the orator has both enthymems and examples at command, which does he recommend should be placed before the other ?
In the passage quoted from Cicero does he follow Aristotle's precept or not ?
Why is the παράδειγμα and its species, when placed before the enthymems, little adapted to a speech ?
What advantage is gained by placing the αράδειγμα after the enthymem ?
In placing the παράδειγμα after the enthymem will one be a sufficient proof, or are several requisite ?
Give the definition of the ἡ γνώμη.
Are the conclusions of enthymems ever γνώμαι ?
How many subaltern genera of the ἡ γνώμη are there ?
Into how many species is the subaltern genus ἄνευ ἐπιλόγου subdivided ?
Into how many species is the other subaltern genus μετ’ ἐπιλόγου subdivided ?
Explain what kind of γνώμαι those are which require not the annexation of the ἐπίλογος.
Explain what kind of γνώμαι those are which require the annexation of the ἐπίλογος.
You have stated that each subaltern genus is subdivided into two species ;
would you be correct in saying that the 1st species of the subaltern genus (ἄνευ ἐπιλόγου) require not the annexation of the ἐπίλογος, because they were understood before uttered ;
and that the 2nd species of the same subaltern genus require not the annexation of the ἐπίλογος, because they are under­ stood as soon as uttered;
and that the 3rd species of the subaltern genus (μετ’ ἐπιλόγου) are parts of enthymems:
and that the 4th species of the same subaltern genus are essentially enthymems, and have the ἐπίλογος as it were inserted in them ?
What division does Aristotle make with respect to the use of γνώμαι ? (i.)On dubious and incredible subjects, which of the above species does Aristotle recommend to be used ?
On subjects not altogether incredible, but obscure, which of the above species does he recommend to be used ? (vi. αἱ δ’ ενθυμήματι καὶ μὲν.)We now come to the third1 use of γνώμαι (τίσιν ἀρμόττει) :
is the use of γνώμαι equally suited to all ages and conditions of persons ?
Ought γνώμαι not universally true to be indiscriminately used in every part of a speech ?
In what occasions then should γνώμαι of this description only be used, and ought they to have the ἐπίλογος ?
Are γνώμαι which are generally admitted to be true, ad­ missible in every part of a speech ?
Are the γνώμαι which contravene current sayings (παρὰ τὰ δεδημοσιευμέναις) equally admissible in every part of a speech?
On what occasions then is it fit that they should be used ? (xiii.)
How will the τὸ ἤθος be made to appear βέλτιον ?
Do I understand you to say “ by being manifested in the diction, or by annexing the reason for the received opinion ?
"What advantages does the use of γνώμαι contribute to the orator ?
When the orator wishes to give his speech an air of moral character by the use of γνώμαι, what principle must he mani­ fest ?
To which species does it belong, and why does it not re­ quire the annexation of the ἐπίλογος ?
The reader is referred to Hobbes' Brief on the subject of these chapters.
You stated in reply to a question in the first book, that the πίστεις διὰ του̃ δείκνυσθαι, &c., were divided into two species, ἐνθύμημα and παράδειγμα:
what subdivision does Aristotle make of the ἐνθύμημα in the second book?
(Book II.
chap. xxii. 14.)How many modes of the ἡ λύσις, or solution of arguments, are there ?
Explain the different methods of starting an objection.
How is an εἰκὸς solvable ?
I low is a solution of them effected ?
WHAT importance does Aristotle ascribe to the λέξις in rhe­ toric ?
Does he ascribe any importance to the ὑπόκρισις ?
In what does he consider it to consist ? (iv.)But why does he treat only of the λέξις when he ascribes importance to the ὑπόκρισις ? (vi. and vii.)
Does he make any distinction between the style of poetry and orations ?
It seems that Aristotle in this definition notes two things as conducive to the λέξεως ἄρετὴ, viz. τὸ σαφη̃ εἶναι and πρέ­ πουσαν ;
how are these attained in style ? (ii. iii. and iv.)
Is the orator obliged to confine himself to the use of the κύρια or words in common use, or is he at liberty to use the other species occasionally ?
What advantage does the use of the κύρια contribute to style ?
What advantage does the use of the γλώτταις, &c. con­ tribute to style when sparingly used ?
When Aristotle says that in the use of ornament we should seek to escape observation, and avoid a studied manner, what would be the consequence of the neglect of this twofold pre­ cept ? (iv.)Does Aristotle lay great stress on the proper use of appro­ priate metaphors in an oration ?
For the selection of metaphors what precepts does Aristotle give ? (ix. xii. xiii.)
From what sources then are appropriate metaphors de­ duced ? (xiii.)
What nouns does Aristotle mention as contributing to a frigid style ?
When do epitbets render an oration frigid ?
Is the too frequent use of appropriate epithets approved by Aristotle ?
When do you conceive a metaphor and epithet unbecom­ ing ? (chap. ii.
9.)In what respect does the εἰκὼν differ from the μεταφορὰ ?
Why does Aristotle caution the orator against the too fre­ quent use of the εἰκὼν ?
Can the μεταφ
ορὰ be enunciated as the εἰκὼν, and the εἰκὼν as μεταφορὰ ?
How would you change a μεταφορὰ to an εἰκὼν ?
On what principle must the εἰκὼν be constructed to be appropriate ?
In what does excellence of style (λέξεως ἀρετὴ) consist ?
On what does purity of style (ro ἑλληνίζειν) depend?
Do I understand you to say the first consists in the proper use of words, and the latter in their clear and proper arrange­ ment ?
Do I understand you to say, because the first are essential to style, or by which it becomes calculated to effect per­ suasion, and the latter only accidental to style, or contributing to give it elegance and beauty ?
How is elevation of style (ὁ ὄγκος) attained ?
When will the τὸ πρέπον, or becoming in style, be attained ?
You say that the τὸ πρέπον in style will be attained, if it be passionate, expressive of moral character, and suited to the subject;

Consequently, there must be an art of Rhetoric.3.
But previous writers have done but little towards it, for αί πίστεις, ἕντεχνόν ἐστι μόνον· τὰ δ’ ἄλλα προσθῆκαι, and they have neglected enthymems, ὅπερ ἐστὶ σῶμα τῆς πίστεως.5.

Laws would therefore be best, if they could mark out διοϱίζειν) all cases, and leave but little to the judges, both on account of the difficulty of getting many good men to legis­ late, and because ai μὲν νομοθεσίαι ἐκ πολλοῡ σκεψαμένων γί­ γνονται· αἱ δὲ κρίσεις ἐξ ὑπογύου· and because the legislator does not judge for the present and particular case, but for the future and universal, and is therefore free from prejudice or passion.

THE END.LET us speak concerning poetry itself, and its [dif- ferent] species what power each possesses, and how fables must be composed, in order that poetry may be such as is fitting:
further still, [let us show] of how many and what kind of parts it consists;
and in like manner [let us treat] concerning such other things as pertain to this method, beginning, con­ formably to nature, first from such things as are first.
The epopee, therefore, and tragic poetry, and moreover comedy, and dithyrambic poetry, and the greatest part of the art pertaining to the flute and the lyre2, are all entirely imitations 3.
They differ, however, in three things ;
for [ they differ either by imitating through means different in kind, or by imi­ tating different objects, or in a different, and not after the same manner.
For as certain persons assimi- lating, imitate many things by colours and figures, some indeed through art, but others through custom, [ and others through voice]4;
thus also in the afore- mentioned arts, all of them indeed produce imitation in rhythm, words, and harmony;
and in these, either distinctly, or mingled together, as, for instance, the arts of the flute and the lyre alone employ harmony and rhythm 5;
and this will also be the case with any other arts which possess a power of this kind, such as the art of playing on.
reed-pipes.
But the arts pertaining to dancing imitate by rhythm, without har­ mony ;
for dancers, through figured rhythms, imitate manners, and passions, and actions.
But the epopee alone imitates by mere words6 or metres, and by these either mingling them with each other, or employing one certain kind of metres, which method has been adopted up to the present time .
For otherwise we should have no common name, by which we could denominate the Mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus, and the dialogues of Socrates;
or those who imitate by trimetres, or elegies, or certain other things of this kind;
except that men joining with metre the verb to make8, call some of these makers of elegies, but others epic makers, not as poets according to imi- tation, but denominating them in common according to measure.
For they are accustomed thus to de­ nominate them, if they write any thing medical or musical in verse.
There is, however, nothing com­ mon to Homer and Empedocles except the measure;
on which account, it is right indeed to call the former a poet;
but the latter, a physiologist rather than a poet.
In like manner, though some one, mingling all the measures, should produce imitation, as Chaere­ mon has done in his Centaur, a mixed rhapsody of all the metres, yet he must not be called a poet.
Let it then be thus laid down concerning these particulars.
But there are some kinds of poetry which employ all the before-mentioned means, 1 mean, rhythm, melody, and measure, such as dithyrambic poetry and the Nomes10, and also tragedy and comedy.
But these differ, because some of them use all these at once, but others partially.
I speak, therefore, of these differ­ ences of the arts in respect to the means by which they produce imitation.
BUT since imitators imitate those who do some- thing, and it is necessary that these should either be worthy or depraved persons;
(for manners nearly always depend on these alone, since all men differ in their manners by vice and virtue;
) it is necessary either [to imitate] those who are better than we are, or those who are worse, or such as are like ourselves 1, in the same manner as painters do.
For Polygnotus, indeed, painted men more beautiful than they are, but Pauson less so, and Dionysius painted them as they are2.
But it is evident that each of the before- mentioned imitations will have these differences ;
and imitation is different, by imitating different things after this manner.
For there may be differences of this kind in dancing, in playing on the flute, on the lyre, and also in orations and mere measure.
Thus Homer imitates better men3 [than exist], but Cleo­ phon men as they are;
and Hegemon the Thasian, who first made parodies, and Nicochares, who wrote the Deliad, imitate worse characters.
In like man­ ner in dithyrambics and the Nomi, [as Timotheus and Philoxenus have imitated the Persians and the Cyclops,] one may imitated By this very same dif­ ference, also, tragedy differs from comedy.
For the one seeks to imitate worse, but the other better men than are.
THERE is also a third difference of these, consist­ ing in the manner in which one may imitate each of them.
For by the same instruments the same things may be imitated, the poet sometimes himself narrating, and Sometimes assuming another person [as Homer does]1 ;
or speaking as the same person with­ out any change;
or as all imitate [who do so] by deed and action.
But imitation consists in these three differences, as we said in the beginning;
viz. in the means, the objects, or the manner.
Hence,
Sophocles will in one respect be the same imitator as Homer, for both of them imitate elevated cha­ racters ;
and in another the same as Aristophanes, for both of them imitate persons engaged in acting;
[2whence also it is said that certain persons call their works dramas, because they imitate those who are engaged in doing something.
On this account the Dorians lay claim to the invention of tragedy and comedy;
of comedy indeed the Megarians, as well those who are natives of Greece, as being invented by them at the time when their government was a democracy, as those of Sicily.
For thence was the poet Epicharmus, who was much prior to Chonides and Magnes.
But some of those Dorians who inhabit Peloponnesus lay claim to tragedy, making names an evidence.
For they allege that they call their villages komai, but the Athenians demoi;
as if comedians were not so denominated from komazein, [i. e. to revel,] but from their wandering through villages, being ignominiously expelled from the cities.
The verb poiein also, or to make, is by the Dorians denominated dran, but by the Athenians prattein.]
And thus much concerning the differences of imita- tion, as to their number and quality.
Two causes, however, and these physical, appear to have produced poetry in general.
r or to imitate is congenial to men from childhood.
And in this they differ from other animals, that they are most imitative, and acquire the first disciplines through imitation;
and that all men delight in imitations.
But an evidence of this is that which happens in the works [of artists].
For we are delighted on survey- ing very accurate images, the realities of which are painful to the view;
such as the forms of the most contemptible animals, and dead bodies.
The cause, however, of this is, that learning is not only most de­ lightful to philosophers, but in like manner to other persons, though they partake of it but in a small degree.
For on this account, men are delighted on surveying images, because it happens that by survey­ ing they learn and infer what each particular is;
as, that this is an image of that man;
since, unless one happen to have seen [the reality], it is not the imi­ tation that pleases 1, but [it is through] either the workmanship, or the colour, or some other cause of the like kind.
But imitation, harmony, and rhythm being natural to us, (for it is evident that measures or metres are parts of rhythms,2 ) the earliest among mankind, making a gradual progress in these things from the beginning, produced poetry from extempo­ rancous efforts.
But poetry was divided according to appropriate manners.
For men of a more vener­ able character imitated beautiful actions, and the actions of such men;
but the more ignoble imitated the actions of depraved characters, first composing vituperative verses, in the same manner as the others composed hymns and encomiums.
Of the authors, therefore, before Homer, we cannot mention any poem of this kind;
though it is probable that there were many such writers.
But if we begin from Homer, there are such for instance as his Margites3, and some others, in which, as being suited, the measure is Iambic.
Hence, also, the Iambic verse is now called, because in this metre they used to Iambize (i. e. de­ fame) each other.
Of ancient poets, likewise, some composed heroic poems, and others Iambic.
But as Homer was the greatest of poets on serious subjects, (and this not only because he alone imitated well, but also because he made dramatic imitations,) thus too he first demonstrated the figures of comedy, not dra­ matically exhibiting invective, but ridicule.
For the Margites bears the same analogy to comedy, as the Iliad and Odyssey to tragedy.
But when tragedy 11.
and comedy had appeared, those poets who were na­ turally impelled to each kind of poetry, some, instead of writing Iambics, became comic poets, but others, instead of [writing] epic poems, became the authors of tragedies, because these forms [of poetry] are!
greater and more esteemed than those.
To con. sider, therefore, whether tragedy is now perfect in its species or not, regarded as well with refer­ ence to itself as to the theatres, is the business of another treatise.
Both tragedy and comedy, there­ fore, at first originated from extemporaneous efforts.
And tragedy, indeed, originated from those who led the dithyramb, but comedy from those who sung the Phallic verses, which even now in many cities re­ main in use;
and it gradually increased as obvious improvements became known.
And tragedy, having experienced many changes, rested when it had ar- rived at its proper nature.
Æschylus, also, first in­ creased the number of players from one to two4, abridged the functions of the chorus, and made one of the players act the chief part5.
But Sophocles in­ troduced three players into the scene, and added scenic painting.
Further still, the magnitude [of tragedy increased] from small fables and ridiculous diction, in consequence of having been changed from satyric6 composition, it was late before it acquired dignity.
The metre also of tragedy, from tetrameter, became Iambic (for at first they used tetrameter in tragedy, because poetry was then satyrical, and more adapted to the dance, but dialogue being adopted, nature herself discovered a suitable metre;
for the Iambic measure is most of all adapted to conversation.
And as an evidence of this, we most frequently speak in Iambics in familiar discourse with each other;
but we seldom speak in hexameters, and then only when we depart from that harmony which is adapted to conversation).
Again, tragedy is said to have been further adorned, with a multitude of episodes, and other particulars.
Let, therefore, thus much said suffice concerning these things;
for it would perhaps be a great toil to discuss every particular.
BUT comedy is, as we have said, an imitation in- deed of bad characters, yet it does not imitate them according to every vice, [but the ridiculous only;
] since the ridiculous is a portion of turpitude.
For the ridiculous is a certain error, and turpitude un­ attended with pain, and not destructive.
Thus, for instance, a ridiculous face is something deformed and distorted without pain.
The transitions, therefore, of tragedy, and the causes through which they are produced, are not unknown;
but [those of] comedy have escaped our knowledge, because it was not at first an object of attention.
For it was late before the magistrate gave a chorus to comedians1;
but prior to that period, the choruses were voluntary.
Comedy, however, at length having obtained a certain form, those who are said to have been poets therein are commemorated.
But it is unknown who it was that introduced masks or prologues,2 or a multitude of players, and such like particulars.
But Epichar­ roDS and Phormis [were the first] to compose fa­ bles ;
which, therefore, originated from Sicily.
But among the Athenians, Crates, rejecting the Iambic3 form, first began generally to compose speeches and fables.
The epopee, therefore, is an attendant on tragedy, [with the exception of the long metre4,] since through this it is an imitation of worthy cha­ racters and actions.
But it differs from tragedy in that it has a simple metre, and is a narration.
It also [differs from it] in length.
For tragedy is especially limited by one period of the sun, or ad­ mits but a small variation from this period;
but the epopee is not defined within a certain time, and in this it differs;
though at first they observed the same conduct with tragedy5, no less than epic po- etry.
With respect to the parts, however, [of the epopee and tragedy,] some are the same in both, but others are peculiar to tragedy.
Hence he who knows what is a good or bad tragedy, knows the same in respect to epic poetry.
For those things which the epopee possesses are to be found in tragedy;
but every thing which tragedy contains is not in the epopee.
CONCERNING, therefore, imitative poetry in hexame­ ters, and comedy, we shall speak hereafter.
Let us now, however, speak concerning tragedy, assuming the definition of its essence as arising from what has been already said.
Tragedy, therefore, is an imita­ tion of a worthy or illustrious and perfect action, possessing magnitude, in pleasing language, using separately the several species of imitation in its parts, by men acting, and not through narration, through pity andfear effecting a purification from such like passions1.
But by pleasing language, 1 mean an- guage possessing rhythm, harmony, and melody.
And it uses separately the several species [of imita­ tion], because some parts of the tragedy are alone perfected through metres, and others again through melody.
But since they produce imitation by act­ ing, in the first place the ornament of the spectacle2 will be a certain part of the tragedy, and in the next place the melopœia 3 and the diction.
For by these they produce imitation.
But I call diction, indeed, the composition of the metres;
and melopœia that, the whole power of which is apparent.
Since, how- ever, [tragedy] is an imitation of action, and action is effected by certain agents, who must needs be per­ sons of a certain description both as to their manners and their sentiments4, (for from these we say that actions derive their quality,) hence there are naturally two causes of actions, Sentiments and moral habit, and through these actions all men obtain or fail of the object of their wishes.
But a fable, indeed, is an imitation of action;
for I mean by a fable here, the composition of incidents.
By manners, I mean those things according to which we say that agents are persons of a certain character;
and by sentiment, that through which those who speak demonstrate any thing, or explain their meaning.
It is necessary, therefore, that the parts of every tragedy should be six, from which the tragedy derives its quality.
But these are, fable and manners, diction and sentiment, spectacle and melopœia.
Of these parts, however, two pertain to the means by which they imitate;
one, to the manner;
and three, to the objects5.
And be- sides these, there are no other.
[Not a few [tragic poets], therefore, as I may say, use all these parts6.]
For every tragedy has scenic apparatus, manners, -and a fable, and melody, and, in a similar manner, sentiment.
But the greatest of these is the combina- tion of the Incidents.
For tragedy is an imitation not of men, but of actions, [of life, and of felicity.
For infelicity consists in action, and the end is a certain action, and not a quality7.]
Men, however, are per­ sons of a certain character, according to their man­ ners ;
but according to their actions, they are happy, or the contrary.
The end of tragedy, therefore, does not consist in imitating manners, but it embraces manners on account of actions;
so that the action but and the fable are the end of tragedy.
But the end action.
is the greatest of all things.
Moreover, without ac­ tion, tragedy cannot exist;
but it may exist without manners.
For most modern tragedies are without manners;
and in short, many poets are such as among painters Zeuxis is when compared with Poly­ gnotus.
For Polygnotus, indeed, painted the man­ ners of the good:
but the pictures of Zeuxis are without manners.
Further still, if any one place in a continued series moral speeches, sayings, and senti­ ments well framed, he will not produce that which is the work of tragedy;
but that will be much more a tragedy, which uses these things as subordinate, and which contains a fable and combination of incidents.
Add to this, that the greatest parts by which fable allures the soul, are the revolutions and discoveries.
Again, it is likewise an evidence of this, that those who attempt to write tragedies, acquire the power of expressing a thing in tragic diction and manners ac­ curately, before they can compose a fable, as was the case with nearly all the first poets.
The fable, there­ fore, is the principal part, and as it were the soul of tragedy;
but the manners are next in rank8.
Just as in painting, if any one were to spread the most beauti- ful pigments on promiscuously, he would not please the view so much as by outlining an image with white colour only.
Tragedy also is an imitation of action, and on this account, especially, [an imitation] of agents.
But the sentiments rank third.
And by them [I mean] the power of explaining what is inherent in the subject, and adapted to it, which is the pecu­ liar province of politics9 and rhetoric.
For the an­ cient poets represent those whom they introduce as speaking politically;
but those of the present day, rhetorically.
But the manners are, whatever shows what the deliberate choice is.
Hence those speeches are without manners, in which there is altogether nothing that the speaker may choose or avoid 10.
But sentiment is that through which they show that a cer­ tain thing is, or is not, or by which they universally enunciate something.
And the fourth part of tragedy is diction.
But I say, as was before observed, that diction is interpretation by the means of words, and which also has the same power in verse and prose.
But of the remaining five, the melopœia is the great­ est of the embellishments.
But the scenic decora­ tion is alluring indeed;
yet it is most inartificial, and is in the smallest degree akin to poetry.
For the power of tragedy remains, even when unaccom­ panied with scenic apparatus and players.
And further still, the art of the mechanic possesses more power in constructing the scenic apparatus than that of the poet.]
THESE things being defined, let us in the next place show what the combination of the incidents ought to be, since this is the first and greatest part of tragedy.
But it is granted to us, that tragedy is the imitation of a perfect and whole action, and of one which pos­ sesses a certain magnitude;
for there may be a whole which has no magnitude.
Hut a whole is that which has a beginning, middle, and end.
And the begin­ ning is that which necessarily is not itself posterior to another thing;
but another thing is naturally ex­ pected to follow it.
On the contrary, the end is that which is itself naturally adapted to be posterior to an­ other thing, either from necessity, or for the most part;
but after this there is nothing else.
But the middle is that which is itself after another thing, and after which there is something else.
Hence, it is necessary that those who compose fables properly, should neither begin them casually, nor end them casually, but should employ the above-mentioned forms [of beginning, middle, and end].
Further still, since that which is beautiful, whether it be an animal, or any thing else which is composed from certain parts, ought not only to have these parts arranged, but a magnitude also which is not casual.
For the beautiful consists in magnitude and order.
Hence, neither can any very small animal be beautiful;
for the survey of it is confused, since it is effected in a time nearly in­ sensible.
Nor yet a very large animal;
for it is not surveyed at once, but its subsistence as one and a whole escapes the view of the spectators;
such as if, for instance, it should be an animal of ten thousand stadia in length.
Hence, as in bodies and in animals it is necessary there should be magnitude;
but such as can easily be seen;
thus also in fables, there should be length, but this such as can easily be re­ membered1.
The definition, however, of the length with reference to conteStS and the senses, does not fall under the consideration of art.
For if it were requisite to perform a hundred tragedies, [as is said to have been the case more than once3,] the perform­ ance ought to be regulated by a clepsydra.
But the definition [of the length of the fable] according to the nature of the thing, is this, that the fable is always more beautiful the greater it is, if at the same time it is perspicuous.
Simply defining the thing, however, we may say, [that a fable has an appropriate magni­ tude,] when the time of its duration is such as to render it probable that there can be a transition from prosperous to adverse, or from adverse to prosperous fortune, according to the necessary or probable order of things as they take place.
This is a sufficient definition of magnitude.
THE fable, however, is one, not as some suppose, if one person is the subject of it;
for many things which are infinite in kind happen [to one man], from a certain number of which no one event arises.
Thus, also, there are many actions of one man, from which no one action is produced.
Hence all those poets appear to have erred who have written the Heracleid, and Theseid, and such like poems.
For they suppose that because Hercules was one person, it was fit that the fable should be one.
Homer, how- ever, as he excelled in other things, appears likewise to have seen this clearly, whether from art, or from nature.
For in composing the Odyssey, he has not related every thing which happened to Ulysses;
such as the being wounded in Parnassus1, and pretending to be insane2 at the muster of the Greeks;
one of which taking place, it was not necessary or probable that the other should happen;
but he composed the Odyssey, as also his Iliad, upon one3 action.
It is requisite, therefore, that as in other imitative arts one imitation4 is the imitation of one thing, thus, also, [in tragedy,] the fable, since it is an imitation of action, should be the imitation of one action, and of the whole of this, and that the parts of the trans­ actions should be so arranged, that any one of them being transposed, or taken away, the whole would become different and changed.
For that which when present or not present produces no sensible [difference], is not a part of the fable5.
BUT it is evident from what has been said, that it is not the province of a poet to relate things which have happened, but such as might have happened, and such things as are possible according to proba­ bility, or which would necessarily have happened1.
For an historian and a poet do not differ from each other, because the one writes in verse and the other in prose;
for the history of Herodotus might be written in verse, and yet it would be no less a history with metre, than without metre.
But they differ in this, that the one speaks of things which have hap­ pened, and the other of such as might have happened.
Hence, poetry is more philosophic, and more deserv­ ing of attention, than history.
For poetry speaks more of universals, but history of particulars.
But universal consists indeed in relating or performing certain things which happen to a man of a certain description, either probably or necessarily, [to which the aim of poetry is directed in giving names2;
] but particular consists in narrating what, [for example,] Aid blades did, or what he sure.
In comedy, therefore, this is now become evident, For [comic poets] having composed a fable through things of a probable nature, they thus give whatever names they please3 to their characters, and do not, like Iambic poets, write poems about particular persons.
But in tragedy they cling to real names.
The cause, how­ ever, of this is that the possible is credible.
Things, therefore, which have not yet been done, we do not yet believe to be possible;
but it is evident that things which have been done are possible;
for they would not have been done, if they were impossible.
Not, indeed, but that in some tragedies there are one or two of known names, and the rest are feigned;
but in others there is no known name;
as, for instance, in the Flower of Agatho.
For in this tragedy, the things and the names are alike feigned, and yet it delights no less.
Hence, one must not seek to ad­ here entirely to traditional fables, which are the sub­ jects of tragedy.
For it is ridiculous to make this the object of search, because even known subjects are known but to a few, though at the same time they delight all men.
From these things, therefore, it is evident that a poet ought rather to be the author of fables than of metres, inasmuch as he is a poet from imitation, and he imitates actions.
Hence, though it should happen that he relates things which have happened, he is no less a poet.
For nothing hinders but that some actions which have happened, are such as might both probably4 and possibly have happened, and by [the narration of] such he is a poet.
But of simple plots and actions, the episodic are the worst.
But 1 call the plot episodic, in which it is neither probable nor necessary that the episodes follow each other.
Such plots, however, are com- posed by bad poets indeed, through their own want of ability5;
but by good poets, on account of the players6.
For, introducing [dramatic] contests, and extending the plot beyond its capabilities, they are frequently compelled to distort the connexion of the parts.
But, since tragedy is not only an imitation of a perfect action, but also of actions which are ter­ rible and piteous, and actions principally become such, [and in a greater degree, when they happen contrary to opinion,7] on account of each other.
* * * *
For thus they will possess more of the marvellous, than if they happened from chance and fortune;
since, also, of things which are from for­ tune, those appear to be most admirable, which seem to happen as it were by design.
Thus the statue of Mityus at Argos, killed him who was the cause of the death of Mityus by falling as he was surveying it.
8
For such events as these seem not to take place casually.
Hence it is necessary that fables of this kind should be more beautiful.
OF fables, however, some are simple, and others complex;
for so also are the actions of which fables are the imitations.
But I call the action simple, from which taking place, as it has been defined, with continuity and unity, there is a transition with­ out either revolution or discovery;
but complex, from which there is a transition, together with discovery, or revolution, or both.
It is necessary, however, that these should be effected from the composition itself of the fable, so that from what has formerly happened it may come to pass that the same things take place either necessarily or probably.
For it makes a great difference whether these things are effected on account of these, or after these.
Now, revolution is a mutation, as has been stated, of actions into a contrary condition;
and this, as we say, according to the probable, or the necessary.
Thus in the " Œdipus,1" the messenger who comes with an intention of delighting CEdipus and liberating him from his fear respecting his mother, when he makes himself known, produces a contrary effect.
Thus, too, in the " Lynceus," he indeed is introduced as one who is to die, and Danaus follows with an intention of killing him;
but it happens from the course of in­ cidents, that Lynceus is saved, and Danaus is slain.
And discovery is, as the name signifies, a change from ignorance to knowledge, or into the friendship or hatred of those who are destined to prosperous or adverse fortune.
The discovery, however, is most beautiful, when at the same time there are, as in the " Œdipus,2 " revolutions.
There are, therefore, other discoveries also.
For sometimes it happens, as has been before observed, that there are discoveries of things inanimate3, and casual;
or if some one has performed, or has not performed, a thing, there is a recognition of it;
but the discovery which especially pertains to the fable and the action is that before mentioned.
For a discovery and revolution of this kind will excite either pity or fear;
and tragedy is supposed to be an imitation of such actions [as excite fear and pity].
Again, it will happen that in­ felicity and felicity will be in such like discover- ies.
But since discovery is a discovery of certain persons, some [discoveries] are of one person only with reference to another, when it is evident who the other person is, but sometimes it is necessary to dis­ cover both persons.
Thus Iphigenia was recognised by Orestes through the sending an epistle4;
but another discovery was requisite to his being known by Iphigenia5.
Two parts of the fable, therefore, viz. revolution and discovery, are conversant with these things;
but the third part is pathos.
And of these, revolution and discovery have been already discussed.
Pathos, however, is an action destructive, or lament­ able ;
such as death when it is obvious, grievous pains, wounds, and such like particulars6.][BUT we have before spoken of the parts of tragedy which are requisite to constitute its quality.
The parts of tragedy, however, according to quantity, and into which it is separately divided, are as follow:
prologue,1 episode,2 exode,3 and chorus, of the parts of which one is the parodos,4 but the other is the sta­ simon.
5
These [five] parts, therefore, are common to all [tragedies];
but the peculiar parts are the songs] from the scene and the kommoi.
And the prologue, indeed, is the whole part of the tragedy, prior to the entrance of the chorus.
The episode is the whole part of the tragedy between two complete odes of the chorus.
The exode is the whole part of the tragedy, alter which there is no further melody of the chorus.
And of the chorus, the parodos, in- deed, is the first speech of the whole chorus;
but the stasimon is the melody of the chorus, without ana- pæst and trochee:
and the commos6 is the common lamentation of the chorus and from the scene.
But we have before shown what the parts of tragedy are which must necessarily be used;
but the parts of it according to quantity, and into which it is separately divided, are these7.
]
IN the next place we must show, as consequent to what has been said, what those who compose fables ought to aim at, and beware of, and whence the purpose of tragedy is effected.
Since, therefore, it is necessary that the composition of the most beau­ tiful tragedy should not be simple, but complex, and that it should be imitative of fearful and piteous ac­ tions-(for this is the peculiarity of such imitation) -in the first place it is evident, that it is not proper that worthy men should be represented as changed from prosperity to adversity, (for this is neither a subject of terror nor commiseration, but is impious,) nor should depraved characters [be represented as changed] from adversity to prosperity;
for this is the most foreign from tragedy of all things, since it pos­ sesses nothing which is proper;
for it neither appeals to moral sense, nor is piteous, nor fearful.
Nor, again, must a very depraved man be represented as having fallen from prosperity into adversity.
For such a composition will indeed possess moral tend­ ency, but not pity or fear.
For the one is conversant with a character which does not deserve to be un­ fortunate ;
but the other, with a character similar [to one's own].
[And pity, indeed, is excited for one who does not deserve to be unfortunate;
but fear, for one who resembles oneself2] ;
so that the event will neither appear to be commiserable, nor terrible.
There remains therefore the character between these.
But a character of this kind is one, who neither ex­ cels in virtue and justice, nor is changed through vice and depravity, into misfortune, from a state of great renown and prosperity, but has experienced this change through some [human] error;
such as Œdipus and Thyestes, and other illustrious men of this kind.
Hence it is necessary that a plot which is well constructed, should be rather single3 than twofold, (though some say it should be the latter,) and that.
the change should not be into prosperity from adversity, but on the contrary into adversity from prosperity, not through depravity, but through some great error, either of such a character [as we have mentioned], or better rather than worse.
But the proof of this is what has taken place, For of old the poets adopted any casual fables;
but now the most beautiful tragedies are composed about a few families;
as for instance, about Alcmaeon, Œdipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, and Telephus4, and such other persons as happen either to have suffered or done things of a dreadful nature.
The tragedy, there­ fore, which is most beautiful according to art, is of this construction.
Hence they erroneously blame Euripides, who accuse him of having done this in his tragedies, and for making many of them terminate in misfortune.
For this method, as we have said, is right;
of which this is the greatest evidence, that in the scenes, and contests of the players, simple fables which terminate unhappily appear to be most tra­ gical, if they are properly acted.
And Euripides, though he does not manage other things well, yet appears to be the most tragic of poets5.
The fable, however, ranks in the second place, though by some it is said to be the first composition, which has a twofold construction, such as the Odyssey, and which terminates in a contrary fortune, both to the better and worse characters.
It appears, however, to rank in the first place, through the imbecility of the spec- tators6.
tor the poets, in composing their plots, ac­ commodate themselves to the wish of the spectators.
This pleasure, however, is not [properly] derived from tragedy, but is rather suited to comedy.
For there, though the greatest enemies be introduced, as Orestes and AEgisthus, yet in the end they depart friends, and no one falls by the hand of the other7.
TERROR and pity, therefore, may be produced from the sight1.
But they may also arise from the com- bination of the incidents, which is preferable, and the province of a better poet.
For it is necessary that the fable should be so composed, that he who hears the things which are transacted, may be seized with horror, and feel pity, from the events, without the assistance of the sight;
and in this manner any one who hears the fable of CEdipus is affected.
But to effect this through spectacle is more inartificial, and requires great expense2.
But they who produce not the terrible, but the monstrous alone, through scenic representation, have nothing in common with tragedy.
For it is not proper to expect every kind of pleasure from tragedy, but that which is ap­ propriate.
Since, however, it is necessary that the poet should procure pleasure from pity and fear through imitation, it is evident that this must be ef­ fected by the circumstances.
Let us, then, ascertain what kind of events appear to be dreadful or lament­ able.
But it is necessary that actions of this kind should either be those of friends towards each other, or of enemies, or of neither.
If, therefore, an ene­ my kills an enemy, he does not show any thing which is an object of pity, neither while he does the deed, nor when he is about to do it, except what arises from the deed itself.
And this will be the case, when one of those who are neither friends nor enemies do the same.
But when these things hap­ pen in friendships3, as when a brother kills a brother, or a son his father, or a mother her son, or a son his mother, or intends to do it, or does any thing else of the like kind-such subjects are to be sought for.
One must not, therefore, [completely] alter the re­ ceived fables.
I mean, for instance, such as the fable of Clytemnestra being slain by Orestes, and of Eriphyle by Alcmaeon.
But it is necessary that the poet should invent the plot, and use in a becoming manner those fables which are handed down.
What, however, we mean by Fusing fables in a becoming manner, let us explain more clearly.
Now, the action may take place in such a way as the ancients have represented it, viz.
knowingly with intent ;
as 'Euri­ pides represents Medea killing her children.
Men may also do an action, who are ignorant of, and afterwards discover their connexion [with, the in­ jured party,] as in the " Œdipus" of Sophocles.
This, therefore, is extraneous to the drama4, but is in the tragedy itself;
as in the " Alcmaeon " of As­ tydamas, or Telegonus in the " Ulysses Wounded 5."
Further still, besides these there is a third mode, when some one is about to perpetrate, through ig­ norance, an atrocious deed, but makes the discovery before he does it6.
And besides these there is no other mode.
For it is necessary to act, or not;
and that knowing, or not knowing.
But of these, to in­ tend to perpetrate the deed knowingly, and not to perpetrate it, is the worst;
for it is wicked and not tragical;
because it is void of pathos.
[Hence, no poet introduces a character of this kind except rarely;
as in the "Antigone," in which Hammon [endeavours to kill his father] Creon, [but does not effect his purpose.]
7 ]
For the action here ranks in the second place.
But it is better to perpetrate the deed ignorantly, and having perpetrated to discover;
for then it is not attended with wickedness, and the discovery excites horror.
The last mode, however, is the best;
I mean, as in the Cresphontes," in which Merope is about to kill her son, but does not, in consequence of discovering that he was her son.
Thus, too, in the " Iphigenia in Tauris," in which the sister is going to kill the brother, [but recog­ nises him ;
] and in the " Helle," the son is about to betray his mother, but is prevented by recognising her.
Hence, as has been formerly observed, trage- dies are not conversant with many families;
for poets were enabled to discover incident of this kind in fables, not from art, but from fortune8.
They were compelled, therefore, to direct their attention to those families in which calamities of this kind happened.
And thus we have spoken sufficiently concerning the combination of the incidents, and have shown what kind of fables ought to be employed.
WITH respect to manners, however, there are four things to which one ought to direct attention:
one, indeed, and the first, that they be good.
But the tragedy will indeed possess manners, if, as was said, the words or the action render any deliberate inten­ tion apparent;
containing good manners 1, if the deliberate intention is good.
But manners are to be found in each genus;
for both a woman and a slave may be good;
though perhaps of these, the one is less good2, and the other is wholly bad3.
In the second place, the manners must be adapted to the per­ sons.
For there are manners which are character­ ized by fortitude, but it is not suited to a woman to be either brave or terrible.
In the third place, the manners must be similar.
For this, as was before observed, differs from making the manners to be good and adapted4.
In the fourth place, they must be uni­ form ;
for if he is anomalous, who exhibits the imita­ tion, and expresses such like manners, at the same time it is necessary that he should be uniformly un- equal.
The example, however, of depraved manners is indeed not necessary;
such, for instance, as that of Menelaus in the " Orestes," but an example of un­ becoming and unappropriate manners is, the lamenta­ tion of Ulysses in the tragedy of " Scylla, " and the speech of Menalippe;
and the example of anomalous manners in the Iphigenia in Aulis.
For Iphigenia supplicating does not at all resemble the Iphigenia in the latter part of the tragedy.
It is requisite, how- ever, in the manners as well as in the combination of the incidents, always to investigate, either the ne­ cessary or the probable;
so that such a person should say or do such things, either necessarily or probably ;
and that it be necessary or probable, that this thing should be done after that.
It is evident, therefore, that the solutions of fables ought to happen from the fable itself, and not as in the "Medea,6" from the machinery, and in the tragedy called the "Iliad," from the particulars respecting the sailing away [from Troy7].
But we must employ machinery in things which are external to the drama, which either hap­ pened before, and which it is not possible for men to know, or which happened afterwards, and require to be previously foretold and announced.
For we ascribe to the gods the power of seeing all things, but we do not admit the introduction of any thing absurd in the incidents 8, but if it is introduced it must be external to the tragedy;
as in the " CEdipus" of Sophocles.
Since, however, tragedy is an imitation of better things, it is necessary that we should im­ itate good painters.
For these, in giving an ap­ propriate form to the image, depict the similitude, but increase the beauty 9.
Thus, also, it is requisite that the poet, in imitating the wrathful and the indo­ lent, and those who are similarly affected in their manners, should form an example of equity, or as­ perity;
such as Agatho and Homer have repre­ sented Achilles.
These things, indeed, it is neces- sary to observe;
and besides these, such perceptions of the senses as are attendant upon poetry, besides the necessary ones.
to For in these, errors are fre­ quently committed.
But concerning these things.
enough has been said in the treatises already pub­ lished.[1 WHAT discovery, however, is, has been before stated.
But with respect to the species of recognition, the first indeed is the most inartificial, and that which most poets use through being at a loss, and is effected through signs.
But of these, some are natural, such as the lance with which the earth-born2 race are marked," or the stars [on the bodies of the sons] in the "Thyestes" of Carcinus.
Others are adventi­ tious, and of these some are in the body, as scars;
but others are external, such as necklaces;
and such as the discovery] through a small boat, in the " Tyro3."
These signs also may be used in a better or worse manner.
Thus Ulysses,4 through his scar, is in one way known by his nurse, and in another by the swineherds.
For the discoveries which are for the sake of credibility, are more inartificial, and all of them are of this kind;
but those which are from revolution, as in the " Washing of Ulysses5," are better.
And those recognitions rank in the second place, which are invented by the poet, on which ac­ count they are inartificial.
Thus Orestes in the " Iphigenia" discovers that he is Orestes6.
For she indeed recognises her brother through a letter, but Orestes himself speaks what the poet designs, but not what the fable requires;
on which account it is near to the above-mentioned error;
since he might have introduced some [of the real things as signs].
Thus, too. in the "Tereus" of Sophocles, the " voice of the shuttle" [produced a recognition7].
But the third mode of discovery is through memory, from the sensible perception of something by sight, as in the " Cyprii " of Dicæogenes;
for on seeing the picture a certain person weeps.
And in the 11 Tale of Alcinous;
" for Ulysses, on hearing the lyrist, and recollecting the story, weeps ;
whence also Fall these] were recog­ nised.
The fourth mode of discovery is derived from syllogism8, as in the " Choephoræ "-a person like me is arrived-there is no person like me but Orestes,—Orestes, therefore, is arrived.
Thus too in the "Iphigenia of Polyides the sophist.
For it was probable that Orestes would syllogistically con­ clude, that because his sister had been immolated, it would likewise happen to him to be sacrificed.
Thus also in the " Tydeus10" of Theodectes, a cer­ tain person comes to discover his son, and himself perishes11.
Another example also is in the "Phinidæ"
For the women, on seeing the place, inferred what their fate would be, viz.
that they must needs perish in this place ;
for they were exposed in it from their infancy.
There is also a certain compound [dis­ covery], which is produced from the false inference of the spectator, as in the " Ulysses the False Messen­ ger."
For he says, he should know the how, which he had not seen;
but the [audience], as if he must be known through this, on this account infer falsely.
The best recognition, however, of all, is that which arises from the things themselves, astonishment being excited through probable circumstances;
as in the "Œdipus" of Sophocles and the "Iphigenia;
" (for it is probable that she would be willing to send letters;
) since such things alone are without fictitious signs and necklaces 12.
But the recognitions which rank in the second place, are those which are derived from syl­ logism.
]
IT is necessary, however, that the poet should form the plots, and elaborate his diction, in such a manner that he may as much as possible place the thing before his own eyes 1.
For thus the poet perceiving most acutely, as if present with the transactions themselves, will discover what is becoming, and whatever is re­ pugnant will be least concealed from his view.
An evidence of this is the fault with which Carcinus is reproached.
For Amphiaraus had left the temple, which was concealed from the spectator, who did not perceive it, and the piece was driven 2 from the stage in consequence of the indignation of the spectators.
For the poet as much as possible should co-operate with the gestures [of the actor] ;
since those are naturally most adapted to persuade who are them­ selves under the influence of passion.
Hence, also, he agitates others who is himself agitated 3, and he excites others to anger who is himself most truly enraged.
Hence, poetry is the province either of one who is naturally clever, or of one who is insane4.
For of these characters, the one is easily fashioned, but the other is prone to ecstasy.
It is likewise necessary that the poet should in a general way lay down the fables composed by others, and those which he composes himself, and afterwards introduce epi­ sodes and lengthen out [the play].
But I say that he should give a general sketch after this manner.
Thus, for instance, in the " Iphigenia5," a certain virgin on the point of being sacrificed, and vanishing from the view of those who were to sacrifice her, and being brought to another country in which it was a law to sacrifice strangers to a certain goddess, she is appointed the priestess of these rites.
Some time after, it happened that the brother of the priestess came to this place;
[but on what account ?
Because some god had ordered him, for a certain reason which does not pertain to the general view of the tragedy,] to come thither, [but why he did so is foreign to the fable6].
The brother, therefore, coming, and being made captive, discovered [his sister], when he is going to be sacrificed;
whether, as Euripides says, [by an epistle,] or, as Polyides feigns, speaking according to probability, because he said, it was not only requi­ site that the sister, but that he also should be sacri- ficed:
—and hence safety arises.
After these things, the poet having given names to the persons, should insert the episodes;
and he must be careful that the episodes be appropriate;
as that of the insanity through which Orestes was taken captive, and his being saved through expiation.
In dramas, therefore, the episodes are short, but by these the epopee is lengthened.
For the fable of the Odyssey is short, viz.
a certain man wandering for many years, and perse­ cuted by Neptune, and left alone.
And besides this, his domestic affairs being so circumstanced, that his -wealth is consumed by suitors, and stratagems are plotted against his son.
But driven by a tempest, he returns, and making himself known to certain per­ sons, he attacks the suitors, and is himself saved, but destroys his enemies.
This, therefore, is the peculi­ arity of the fable, but the rest is episode.[IN every tragedy, however, there is a complication and development 1.
And external circumstances in­ deed, and some of those that are internal, frequently form the complication;
but the rest the development.
I call, however, the complication, the whole of that which extends from the beginning to the last part, from which there is a transition to good fortune;
but I call the development that part which extends from the beginning of the transition to the end.
Thus in the Lynceus of Theodectes, the past trans­ actions, and the capture of the son, are the compli­ cation ;
but the part which extends from the charge of murder to the end, is the development.
But of tragedy there are four species;
for so many parts of it have also been enumerated.
And one species is the complicated, of which the whole is revolution and discovery;
another, the pathetic, such as the tragedies of Ajax and Ixion;
another, the morale such as the Phthiotides and the Peleus;
but the fourth is another such as the " Phorcides3" and the "Prometheus," and the tragedies which represent what passes in Hades.
It is especially necessary, therefore, that the poet should endeavour to have all these species;
or at least that he should have the greatest and most of them, especially since men of the present age calumniate the poets.
For as there have been good poets in each part of tragedy, they now expect one poet to excel in all the parts.
But it is right to call tragedy different and the same, though not perhaps with any reference to the fable;
but this [may be the case with those] of which there is the same plot and solution.
But many poets com­ plicate well, and develope badly4.
But both these should always be applauded 5.
But it is necessary to recollect, as has been often observed, that we must not make tragedy an epic system.
Now, I call that tragedy an epic system, which consists of many fables;
as if some one should compose a tragedy from the whole fable of the Iliad.
For in the Iliad, on account of its length, the parts receive an appro­ priate magnitude.
But in dramas, the effect pro- duced would be very contrary to expectation.
The truth of this is indicated by such as have repre­ sented [in one tragedy] the whole destruction of Troy, and not some part of it, as the "Niobe" or "Medea" of Euripides, and who have not acted like Æschylus ;
for these have either been condemned, or contend without success ;
since Agatbo also failed in this alone.
But in revolutions, and in simple ac­ tions, those poets admirably effect their aim.
For this is tragical, and has a moral tendency.
This, however, takes place when a wise but a depraved man, such as Sisyphus, is deceived;
and a brave but unjust man is vanquished.
But this is probable, as Agatho says.
For it is probable that many things may take place contrary to probability.
It is neces- sary likewise to conceive the chorus to be one of the players 6 and a part of the whole, and that it co-oper­ ates with the players, not as in Euripides 7, but as in Sophocles.
But with other tragedians, the choral songs do not more belong to that fable, than to any other tragedy;
on which account the chorus sing detached pieces, inserted at pleasure8, of which Aga­ tho was the inventor.
What difference, however, does it make, to sing inserted pieces, or to adapt the diction of one drama to another, or the whole episode ?
OF the other parts of tragedy enough has now been said.
But it remains that we should speak concern­ ing the diction and the sentiments.
The particulars, therefore, respecting the sentiments, are unfolded in the treatise on Rhetoric, to which it more properly belongs.
But those things pertain to the sentiments, which it is requisite to procure by a reasoning pro- cess.
And the parts of these are, to demonstrate, to refute, and to excite the passions;
such as pity, or fear, or anger, and such like;
and besides these, to amplify and extenuate.
It is evident, however, that in things, also, it is requisite to derive what is useful from the same forms, when it is necessary to procure objects of pity, or things that are dreadful, or great, or probable.
Except that there is this difference, that things in tragedy ought to be rendered apparent without teaching, but in an oration they are to be shown by the speaker, and in consequence of the speech.
For what employment would there be for the orator, if the things should appear [of themselves] pleasing, and not through the speech ?
But of things pertaining to diction, there is one species of theory respecting the forms of speech 1, which it is the pro- vince of the actor to know, and of him who is a master artist in this profession.
Thus, for instance, [it is requisite he should know,] what a mandate is, what a prayer, narration, threats, interrogation and an­ swer are, and whatever else there may be of this kind.
For from the knowledge or ignorance of these, the poetic art incurs no blame of any moment, F or who would think that Homer errs in what he is reproved for by Protagoras?
viz. that while he fancies he prays, he commands, when he says, " The wrath, 0 goddess, sing."
For, says he, to order a thing to be done, or not to be done, is a mandate.
Hence, this must be omitted as a theorem pertaining to another art, and not to poetry.[I OF all diction, however, the following are the parts;
viz. the letter, the syllable, the conjunction, the noun, the verb, the article, the case, and the sentence.
The letter, therefore, indeed, is an indivisible sound 2;
yet not every such sound, but that from which an intelli­ gible sound is adapted to be produced.
For there are indivisible vocal sounds of brutes, no one of which I call a letter 3.
But the parts of this indivisible sound are, vowel, semi vowel, and mute.
And a vowel, indeed, is that which has an audible sound, without percussion4;
such as a and o.
But a semi­ vowel is that which has an audible sound, with per­ cussion ;
as s and r.
And a mute is that which, even with the concurrence of the tongue, has of itself, indeed, no sound, but becomes audible in conjunction with things which have a certain sound;
as g and d.
But these differ by the configurations of the mouth, in the parts [of the mouth5] by density and tenuity of aspiration, by length and shortness;
and further still, they differ by acuteness and gravity, and by the medium between both these;
the theory respecting each of which pertains to the metrical art.
But a syllable is a sound without signification, composed from a mute, and an element which has sound [i. e. from a vowel, or semivowel].
For g r without a is a syllable 6, and also with a, as g r a.
The study, however, of the differences of these, per­ tains also to the metrical art.
But a conjunction is a sound void of signification, which neither impedes nor produces one significant sound adapted to be composed from many sounds, and which may be placed either at the beginning or the end of the pe­ riod, unless something requires that it should be placed by itself at the beginning;
such as μὲν, ἢτοι, τή.
Or it is a sound without signification, composed from more sounds than one, but naturally adapted to produce one significant sound.
An article is a sound without signification, which shows the beginning, or end, or distinction of a word 7;
as τὸ and τὸ περί, and others of the like kind.
Or φημί, it is a sound without signification, which neither impedes nor pro­ duces one significant sound naturally adapted to be composed from many sounds, both in the extremes and in the middle.
But a noun is a composite sound, significant without time, of which no part is of itself significant.
For in double nouns, we do not use the parts as of themselves significant.
Thus, in the word Theodorus, [though Theos signifies God and doron a gift,] yet doron signifies nothing.
A verb is a com- posite sound, significant with time, of which no part is of itself significant, in the same manner also as in nouns.
For man or white does not signify time;
but he walks, or he did walk, signify, the former indeed the present, and the latter the past time.
But case pertains to noun or verb.
And one case, indeed, [in nouns] signifies that something is said of this thing, or is attributed to8 this thing, and the like;
but another is that which pertains to one thing or many things;
as men, or man.
And another case pertains to acting9, such as what relates to interro­ gation or demand.
For did he walk ?
Or walk is a case of a verb according to these species.
And a sentence is a composite significant sound, of which certain parts of themselves signify something;
for not every sentence is composed from nouns and verbs, (since the definition of man10 is a sentence without a verb,) but there may be a sentence without verbs.
A sentence, however, will always have some part significant;
as in the sentence Cleon walks, the word Cleon is significant, But a sentence is one in a twofold respect;
for it is either that which signi­ fies one thing, or that which becomes one from many by conjunction 11.
Thus the Iliad, indeed, is one by conjunction;
but the definition of man is one, be­ cause it signifies one thing.
]
WITH respect to the species of a noun, one is simple;
and I call the simple noun that which is not com­ posed from significant parts;
but another is two­ fold.
And this either consists of that which is sig­ nificant, and that which is without signification, or of both parts significant.
A noun also may be triple and quadruple, as is the case with many of the nouns of the Mesraliotæ1:
such as Hermocaïcoxanthus 2.
But every noun is either proper or foreign 3, or me- taphorical, [or ornamental 4,] or invented, or ex­ tended, or contracted, or altered.
But I call that a proper name, which is used by every one;
and that a foreign5 name which is used by other nations.
Hence it is evident that the same noun may be both foreign and proper, though not to the same people.
For the word Σίγυνον6 is proper to the Cyprians, but foreign to us.
But a metaphor7 is the transposi­ tion of a noun from its proper signification, either from the genus to the species, or from the species to the genus;
or from species to species, or according to the analagous.
I call, however, a transposition from genus to species, such as, Secure in yonder port my vessel stands 8. For to be moored is a species of standing.
But a transposition from species to genus is such as, Ten thousand valiant deeds Ulysses has achieved9.
For ten thousand is a great number, and is now used instead of many.
And a transposition from species to species is such as, The brazen falchion drew away his life.
And, Cut by the ruthless sword 10.
For here to draw away, is used instead of to cut;
and to cut is used instead of to draw away;
since both imply the taking something away.
But I call it analogous, when the relation of the second term to the first is similar to that of the fourth to the third;
for then the fourth is used instead of the second, or the second instead of the fourth.
[And sometimes the proper term is added to the relative terms11.]
I say, for instance, a cup has a similar relation to Bacchus that a shield has to Mars.
Hence, a shield may be called the cup of Mars, and a cup the shield of Bac­ chus.
Again, evening has the same relation to day that old age has to life.
One may therefore say that evening is the old age of day, and that old age is the evening of life ;
or as Empedocles calls it, " The set­ ting of life12."
In some instances, also, where there is no analogous name, this method may be no less similarly employed.
Thus, to scatter grain is to sow;
but there is no name for the scattering of light from the sun, and yet this has a similar relation to the sun that sowing has to grain.
Hence, it is said, Sowing his god-created flame.
This mode of metaphor may likewise be used differ- ently, when, calling a thing by a foreign name, some­ thing belonging to it is denied of it;
as if one should call a shield not the cup of Mars, but the wineless cup.
But an invented noun is that, in short, which, not being adopted by others, is introduced by the poet himself.
For it appears that there are certain nouns of this kind ;
as substituting ἓρνυγες instead of κέρατα for horns 13, and calling a priest άρητήρ14, instead of ίερεύς.
And a word is extended or contracted, partly by using a vowel longer than the proper one, or by inserting a syllable;
and partly by taking something away from it.
An extended noun, indeed, is such as πόληος for πόλεως, and πηληϊάδεω for πηλείδου ;
but the contracted, such as κρι̃, and δω̃15;
and, The sight of both is one.
And a word is changed when the poet leaves part of it, and invents part;
as, In the right breast 17. Instead of δεξιόν. [18
Further still, of nouns some are masculine, others feminine, and others between, [or neuter].
And the masculine, indeed, are such as end in v, and p, and a, and such as are composed from σ;
but these are two, ψ and ξ.
The feminine nouns are such as are composed from vowels, and always end in long vowels;
as, for instance, in η and ω, or in a of the doubtful.
Hence it happens that the number of terminations for masculine and feminine are equal;
for the terminations of ψ and £ are the same.
No noun, however, ends in a mute, or in a short vowel;
and only three nouns end in ι, viz.
μέλι ,κόμμι, and πέπερι.
But five end in v ;
viz.
πω̃ϋ, να̃πυ, γόνυ, δόρυ, and ἂστυ.
And the neuter nouns end in these, and in v and c.]
THE virtue of diction, however, consists in being per­ spicuous, and not mean 1.
The diction, therefore, is most perspicuous, which is composed from proper nouns, but then it will be mean.
But an example of this is the poetry of Cleophon and Sthenelus.
It will, however, be elevated, and remote from the vul­ gar idiom, by employing unusual words.
But I call unusual words, such words as are foreign, the meta­ phorical, the extended, and every word except the proper [name of a thing].
It, however, [a Poet wholly employ such words as these, it will be either an enigma, or a barbarism.
If, therefore, it were composed from metaphors, it would be an enigma;
but if from foreign words, a barbarism.
For the essence of an enigma is this, to unite things impos­ sible, yet really true2.
Now, from the arrangement of the words, it is not possible to effect this, but it may be effected by a metaphor;
as " I saw a man who had glued brass to a man with fire3;
" and others of the like kind.
[But from the composition of foreign -words a barbarism is produced4.]
Hence language should be moderately varied with these.
Foreign, therefore, metaphorical, [and ornamental] words, and the other species that have been mentioned, will cause the diction to be neither vulgar nor mean;
but proper words produce perspicuity.
But the extend- ing, contracting, and changing of names, contribute in no small degree to the perspicuity of the diction, without vulgarity.
For the use of words in a way different from their proper and usual signification, causes the diction to be not vulgar;
but the adoption of words in their accustomed meaning, renders it perspicuous.
Hence those do not blame rightly, who find fault with this mode of speech, and like the an­ cient Euclid ridicule the poet, [objecting] that verse might easily be composed, if one permit the quantity of syllables to be lengthened at pleasure, making Iam­ bics even in common discourse ;
as And, It is evident, therefore, that to be detected using this mode of diction is ridiculous.
[But measure is com­ mon to all the parts of diction 6.]
For it would pro­ duce the same effect, to make an improper and ridiculous use of metaphors, foreign words, and other forms of diction.
But how great a difference is made by the appropriate use of them, may be seen in epic poetry, by putting the words in metre.
And he who transfers proper names into foreign words, into metaphors, and the other forms, will see that what we have said is true.
Thus, for instance, Æschylus and Euripides made the same Iambic verse;
but by only changing one word from its proper and usual to a foreign signification, the one verse appears beautiful, and the other mean.
For Æschylus in­ deed, in his Philoctetes, writes, A cancerous ulcer feeds upon my foot.
But Euripides, instead of ἐσθίει, feeds, uses the word θοινα̃ται, banquets on.
And, by inserting proper [and common] words, it will be, And, Or change, ἠϊόνες βοόωσιν (the shores rebellow9) to ἠϊόνες κράζουσιν (the shores cry out).
[10Again, Ariphrades used to ridicule the tragic poets for em­ ploying modes of diction, which no one would use in common conversation;
such as δωμάτων a7ro, and not ἀπὸ δωμάτων, i. e. home from, and not from home ;
σέθεν [for σου̃];
ἐγὼδέ νιν11, and ’Αχιλλως πέρι, and not περὶ ’Αχιλλέως,i. e. Achilles about, and not about Achilles;
and other expressions of the like kind.
For all such forms of language, because they are not in common use, remove vulgarity from the diction.
But this he did not know.]
It is, however, a great thing to use each of the above-mentioned modes in a becoming manner;
and also compound and foreign words.
But the greatest thing is to employ meta­ phors well.
For this alone cannot be acquired from another, but it is an indication of an excellent genius;
since to employ metaphors well, is to discern simili­ tude.
But of words, the compound are chiefly suited to dithyrambic verse, the foreign to heroic, and metaphors to Iambic verse.
And in heroic verse, indeed, all the above-mentioned words are useful;
but in Iambics, because they especially imitate com­ mon discourse, those words are adapted which may be also used in conversation.
And words of this description are, the proper, the metaphorical, land the ornamental.]
And thus much may suffice con­ cerning tragedy, and the imitation in acting13.
CONCERNING the poetry, however, which is narrative and imitative in metre, it is evident that it ought to have dramatic fables, in the same manner as tragedy, and should be conversant with one whole and per­ fect action, which has a beginning, middle, and end, in order that, like one whole animal, it may produce its appropriate pleasure1;
and that it may not be like the custom of histories, in which it is not necessary to treat of one action, but of one time, viz.
of such things as have happened in that time, respecting one or more persons, the relation of each of which things to the other is just as it may happen.
For as the sea-fight at Salamis, and the battle with the Cartha­ ginians in Sicily, though they happened at the same time, tend nothing to the same end;
thus also in suc­ cessive times, one thing may sometimes be connected with another, from which no one end is produced.
But nearly all poets do this.
Hence, as we have before observed, in this respect also Homer will ap­ pear to be divine, when compared with other poets, because he did not attempt to sing of the whole of the Trojan war, though it had a beginning and an end.
For if he had, it would have been very great, and not sufficiently conspicuous;
or if it had been of a moderate size, it would have been intricate through the variety of incidents 2.
But now, having selected one part of the war, he has made use of many episodes;
such as the catalogue of the ships, and other episodes, with which he has adorned his poem.
Other poets, however, have composed a fable about one man, and one time, and one action, consist­ ing of many parts;
as the authors of the Cypriacs, and the Lesser Iliad.
[With respect to the Iliad and Odyssey, therefore, one or two tragedies only could be made from each.
But many might be made from the Cypriacs;
and from the Lesser Iliad more than eight;
such as the Judgment of the Arms4, Philoctetes5, Neoptolemus, Eurypylus6, the Begging [of Ulysses], the Lacænæ, the Destruction of Troy, the Return of the Greeks, Sinon, and the Troades.
AGAIN, it is requisite that the epopee should have the same species as tragedy.
[For it is necessary that it should be either simple, or complex, or ethical, or pathetic1.]
The parts also are the same, except the music and the scenery.
For it requires revolutions, discoveries, and disasters;
and besides these, the sen- timents and the diction should be well formed;
all which were first used by Homer, and are used by him fitly.
For of his two poems, the Iliad indeed con­ tains the simple and pathetic;
but the Odyssey, the complex;
for through the whole of it there is dis­ covery 2 and moral.
And besides these things, he excelled all poets in diction and sentiment.
The epopee, however, differs from tragedy in the length of the composition, and in the metre.
But the pro­ per boundary of its length has been before described;
for it should be such that the beginning and the end may be seen at one view.
[And this will be effected if the compositions are shorter than those of the an­ cient poets, and brought to the same length with the multitude of tragedies that are recited at one hear- ing3.]
But it is the peculiarity of the epopee to possess abundantly the power of extending its mag­ nitude ;
for tragedy is not capable of imitating many actions that are performed at the same time, but that part only which is represented in the scene, and acted by the players.
But in the epopee, in conse­ quence of its being a narration, many events may be introduced which have happened at the same time, which are properly connected with the subject, and from which the bulk of the poem is increased.
Hence, this contributes to its magnificence, transports the hearer to different places, and adorns the poem with dissimilar episodes.
For similitude of events rapidly produces satiety, and causes tragedies to fail.
But heroic metre is established by experience as adapted to the epopee.
For if any one should attempt narra­ tive imitation in any other metre, or in many metres mingled together, the unfitness of it would be apparent.
For heroic metre is of all others the most stable and ample.
[Hence it especially receives foreign words and metaphors.
For narrative imita­ tion excels all others4.]
But Iambics and tetrametres have more motion;
the one being adapted to dancing, but the other to acting.
It would, however, be still more absurd, to mingle them together, as Chætemon 5 did.
Hence, no one has composed a long poem in any other measure than the heroic ;
but, as we have said, Nature herself teaches us to distinguish the measure best suited.
Homer, indeed, deserves to be praised for many other things, and also because he is the only poet who was not ignorant what he ought to do himself.
For it is requisite that the poet should speak in his own person as little as possible ;
for so far as he does so he is not an imitator.
Other poets, therefore, take an active part through the whole poem, and they only imitate a few things, and seldom7.
But Homer, after a short preface, imme­ diately introduces a man or a woman, or something else8 that has manners;
for there is nothing in his poem unattended with manners.
It is necessary, therefore, in tragedies to produce the wonderful;
but that which is contrary to reason (whence the wonder­ ful is best produced) is best suited to the epopee, from the agent not being seen9.
In the next place, the particulars respecting the pursuit of Hector would appear ridiculous in the scene;
the Greeks indeed standing still, and not pursuing, and Achilles making signs to them, by the motion of his head, not to engage10.
But in the epopee this is concealed.
Now, the wonderful pleases;
of which this is an in­ dication, that all men, when they wish to gratify their hearers, add something to what they relate.
Homer also in the highest degree taught others how to feign in a proper manner.
But this is a paralogism.
For men fancy that when the consequent follows or re­ sults from the antecedent, the consequent may be converted, and that the antecedent will follow from the consequent.
This, however, is false.
[But why, if the antecedent be false, so long as this other be otherwise, should the consequent necessarily follow ?
For through knowing the consequent to be true, our soul paralogizes, and concludes that the antecedent also is true.
And there is an example of this in " the Washing 11.”]
Again, one should prefer things which are impossible but probable, to such as are possible but improbable.
Fables also should not be composed from irrational parts, [but as much as possible, in­ deed, they should have nothing irrational in them:
if, however, this is impossible, care should be taken that the irrational circumstance does not pertain to the fable, as in the case of Œdipus not knowing how Laius died 12.
For it must not be brought into the drama, like the narration of the Pythian games in the Electra 13, or him who, in the tragedy of the Mysians, comes from Tegea to Mysia without speak­ ing.]
It is ridiculous, therefore, to say, that other­ wise the fable would be destroyed;
for such fables should not at first be composed.
But if they are composed, and it appears more reasonable that they should be, the absurdity also must be admitted;
since the irrational circumstances in the Odyssey, such as Ulysses being left [on the shore of Ithaca by the Phœacians ], would evidently have been intoler­ able, if they had been fabricated by a bad poet.
But now the poet conceals the absurdity, and renders it pleasing by the addition of other beauties.
The dic- tion, likewise, should be laboured in the sluggish parts of the poem, and which exhibit neither manners nor sentiment14.
For a very splendid15 diction con­ ceals the manners and the reasoning.[WITH respect to critical objections1, and the solu- tons of them, the number and quality of their species will become apparent from surveying them as follows.
Since the poet is an imitator, in the same manner as a painter, or any other person who makes likenesses, it is necessary that he should always imitate one of the three [objects of imitation].
For he must either imitate things such as they were or are, or such as they are said and appear to be2, or such as they ought to be.
But these are enunciated either by [common] diction, or by foreign words and meta­ phors.
For there are many modifications3 of diction;
and we concede these to the poets.
Besides this, there is not the same rectitude of politics and poetry, nor of any other art and poetry.
But of poetry itself, the error is twofold;
the one essential, the other accidental.
For the error is essential, when it at­ tempts to imitate that which is beyond its power;
but [when it attempts to imitate improperly, as4] if, for instance, a horse should be described as moving both its right legs together, or an error in any of the arts be committed in, poetry, as in medicine, or any other art, when it fabricates things that are impos­ sible, these, therefore, whatever they may be, are not the essential errors of poetry.
Hence, one must re- fute the objections of critics from surveying these particulars.
For in the first place, indeed, the poet errs, if what he fabricates is impossible according to the art itself;
but it will be right if the end of po­ etry is obtained by it.
For we have before shown what the end is, viz.
if the poet thus renders what he.
fabricates, or any other part of the poem, more capable of producing a more striking effect5.
An example of this is the pursuit of Hector.
If, how­ ever, this end can be more or less attained, and that according to the art pertaining to these things, then the fault will not be excusable.
For it is requisite if possible to be entirely without error.
Further still, -it should be considered whether the error ranks among things essential to the poetic art, or foreign and incidental.
For it is a less fault not to know that a hind has no horns, than to depict a bad copy of one.
Besides this, also, if the poet is blamed for not imitating things as they truly are, the reply is, but he imitates them as they should be.
Thus So­ phocles said, that he described men such as they should be, but Euripides such as they are.
If, how­ ever, it should be objected, that the poet represents things in neither of these ways, he may say that he represents them as men say they are;
as, for in­ stance, in things pertaining to the gods.
For per- haps it is neither better thus to speak, nor true, but it is just as it may happen;
as Xenophanes observes, "At any rate they tell us such things6."
Perhaps, however, it may be said, that it is not better, indeed, thus to speak, but that the thing was so;
as in the passage concerning the arms [of the sleeping sol­ diers of Diomed]:
fixed upright in the earth
Their spears stood by 7 For such was the custom at that time, as it is now with the Illyrians.
With respect, however, to the inquiry whether a thing is said or done by any one well or ill, we must not only regard the thing itself which is done or said, whether it is good or bad, but we must also [consider] the person by whom it is done or said, viz.
concerning whom, or when, or to whom, or on what account, he speaks or acts;
as whether it is for the sake of bringing to pass a greater good, or in order to avoid a greater evil.
But it is requisite to remove some objections by looking to the diction;
as, for instance, to foreign words:
On mules th' infection first began.
For perhaps he does not use οὐρη̃ας to signify mules, but guards8.
And in what he says of Dolon, —— of form unhappy
It may be said that εἷδος κακὸς does not signify a body without symmetry, but a deformed face.
For the Cretans call a man with a good face εὐειδής.
And, For ζωρότερ
ον may not mean undiluted wine, as for intemperate drinkers, but wine poured out rapidly.
But a thing is said metaphorically, as, The other gods and men 11 Slept all the night.
And at the same time he says :
For all is said metaphorically, instead of many, all12 being a species of many.
And thus οἴη δ’ἄμμορος is said of Orion metaphorically.
For that which is most known, is called alone or sole13.
Objections also may be solved from accent, as Hippias the Thasian solved the following passages :
And, Objections likewise may be solved by punctuation;
as in the following instance from Empedocles, Or by ambiguous expressions, as [in Iliad, x.]
Night of two parts the greater share had waned, But of her empire still a third remain'd.
For the word πλέων is ambiguous.
Or objections may be answered from the custom of diction;
as when wine is called κεκραμένον, mixed17 ;
whence has been said, Greaves of new-wrought tin.
And those that work on iron are called braziers18.
Whence Ganymede is said To pour out wine for J ove 19;
Il. 20. though the gods do not drink wine.
But this may also be metaphorically said.
It is necessary, how­ ever, when a word appears to signify something of a contrary nature, to consider how many significations it may have in the passage before us;
as, " There stuck the lance20 :
”
For here the word stuck implies that the lance teas impeded.
Of how many different senses a word may admit, one may learn thus, by a contrary manner from what Glauco says21, [when he asserts that] “some men presuppose irrationally, and then reason from their own decision:
and, having once pronounced their opinion, reprobate whatever is contrary to their [preconceived] opinion."
This was the case with re" sped to Icarius.
For the multitude fancy that he was a Laconian.
On this supposition, therefore, it is ab­ surd that Telemachus should not meet him, on his ar­ rival at Lacedæmon22.
Perhaps, however, the truth is as the Cephalenians say, viz, that Ulysses married among them, and that Icadius, and not Icarius, [was. his father-in-law].
It is probable, therefore, that this objection is erroneous.
In short, it is necessary to refer the impossible either to the poetry, or to that which is better, or to opinion.
For, with respect to poetry, probable impossibility is more eligible, than the improbable and possible, and things should be such as Zeuxis23 painted.
And also [we may refer the impossible] to that which is better24:
for it is ne­ cessary that the pattern should transcend those things which are said to be irrational.
The objection, also, that something is irrational may be solved by saying, that sometimes it is not irrational;
for it is probable that what is improbable may have happened.
But with respect to the solution of apparent contraries, these are to be considered in the same manner as elenchi in arguments, if the same thing [is affirmed or denied], and with respect to the same thing, and after the same manner, and whether it is the same person [who affirms and denies], and also with what reference he speaks, and what a wise man would un- derstand from his words26.
The reprehension [of poets] on the score of improbability27 and vicious manners will be right, through which it is shown, that they have without any necessity devised some­ thing irrational.
Thus irrationality is used [with­ out any necessity] by Euripides in his Ægeus, and viciousness, in the character of Menelaus, in his Orestes.
The reprehensions, therefore, may be de­ rived from five species.
For they are either made because impossibilities are introduced, or absurdities, or things of evil tendency, or contraries, or as errors committed against the rectitude of art.
But the so­ lutions may be surveyed from the above-mentioned number;
for they are twelve.
28]ONE may, however, question whether epic or tragic imitation is the more excellent.
For if that imita­ tion is the better which is less troublesome to the spectator, and such an imitation pertains to better spectators, that which imitates every thing is evi­ dently attended with molestation.
For, as if the spectators will not perceive what is acted without the addition of much movement 1, they make great gesticulations;
just as bad players on the flute turn themselves round, when it is requisite to imitate the action of the discus;
or when they sing of Scylla, draw to themselves2 the coryphæus, or leader of the band.
Such, then, is tragedy, as the modern actors are in the estimation of their predecessors3.
Hence, Mynis­ cus called Callipides an ape, in consequence of carry­ ing his imitation to a great excess.
And there was also a similar opinion respecting Pindar [the player].
But as these latter actors are to the former, so is the whole art of tragedy to the epopee.
They say, there­ fore, that the epopee is calculated for hearers of the better sort, on which account it does not require scenery;
but that tragedy is calculated for the vul­ gar.
Hence, tragic imitation, which is troublesome to the spectator, will evidently be inferior to epic imitation.
In the first place, however, this accusation does not pertain to the poet, but the actor;
since it is possible in reciting epic poetry to overdo action, as Sosistratus did, and singing likewise, as Mnastheus of Opus did.
In the next place, neither is all motion to be despised, since neither is every kind of dancing, but only that which is bad;
and hence Callipedes was blamed, as others now are for imitating light women 4.
Further still, tragedy, in the same manner as the epopee, may fulfil its purpose without gesture;
for by reading, it is manifest what kind of thing it is.
If, therefore, it is in other respects better, it is not ne­ cessary that it should be accompanied [by motion and gesture.
In the next place, tragedy has every thing which the epopee possesses.
For it may use metre, and it has also music and scenery, as no small parts, through which the pleasure it produces is most ap­ parent.
To which may be added, that it possesses perspicuity, both when it is read, and when it is acted.
The end, too, of its imitation is confined in less extended limits.
For being crowded into a nar­ rower compass, it becomes more pleasing than if it were diffused through a long period of time.
Thus, for instance, if one were to put the CEdipus of Sophocles into as many verses as the Iliad, [it would be less pleasing].
Again, the imitation of the epopee has less unity [than tragic imitation];
of which this is an indication, that from any kind of [epic] imita­ tion many tragedies may be produced.
Hence, if he who writes an epic poem should choose a fable per­ fectly one, the poem would necessarily either appear short, as if curtailed, or if it should be accompanied with length of metre, it would seem to be languid5.
But if he should compose one fable from many fables, I mean, if the poem should consist of many actions, it would not possess unity.
Thus, the Iliad and Odyssey contain many such parts, which of them­ selves possess magnitude, though these poems are composed, as much as possible, in the most excellent manner, and are most eminently the imitation of one action. '
If, therefore, tragedy excels in all these particulars, and besides this, in the work of art, (for neither tragic nor epic imitation ought to produce a casual pleasure, but that which has been stated,) it is evident that it will be more excellent than the epopee, in consequence of attaining its end in a greater degree.
And thus much concerning tragedy, and the epopee, as to themselves, their species, and their parts, their number, and their difference, what the causes are of their being good or bad, and also concerning the objections which may be made to them, and the solutions of the objections.

Compare the respective merits of epic and tragic Poetry.I.—1. ON Poetry in general, its species and parts.
2. Now, all Poetry is an imitation, as also flute and cithern- playing, but they differ either in the means, the objects, or the manner of their imitation.
7.
But custom has falsely connected the name of poet with the metre only, and not with their manner of imitation, as is shown in the case of Empedocles and Chaeremon.
10.
Dithyrambs, nomes, tragedy, and comedy employ all the means of imitation, but some do so all together, others separately.
II.—1. But since actions are the objects of imitation, the characters must be bad or good, κακίᾳ γὰρ καὰ ἀϱετῃ̃ τὰ ἤθη διαφέϱουϭι πάντες;
and hence men must be imitated either as they are, or under a more exalted or more contemptible view, as in the respective paintings of Dionysius, Polygnotus, and Pauson.
The same thing holds good in other arts, and in Poetry, as is shown by Cleophon, Homer, and Hegemon re­ spectively.
III.—1. The third difference is as to the manner of imi­ tation.
For the poet may imitate the same object, and by the same means, but he may do so either, I. in narrative, i. e. by personating other characters, or in his own person, II.
Or he may represent πάνας ὡς πράττοντας καὶ ἐνεϱγου̃ντας.IV.
Two natural causes of Poetry, i.
To imitate is the peculiar faculty and pleasure of man, as is evident from his taste for images, pictures, etc., the resemblance even of the worst objects causing satisfaction.
And this results from the pleasure felt in learning and forming conclusions.
6.
II.
Moreover, rhythm and harmony are equally natural to us, and τὰ μέτρα μόϱια τω̄ν ῥυθμω̄ν ἐϭτί.8.
Iambic was the fit metre for vituperation.
But Homer, by substituting τὸ γελοι̃ον for ψόγος, suggested comedy, for his Margites has the same relation to comedy as the Iliad to tragedy.
10. And the heroic and vituperative poets respec­ tively became τραγωδιδιάϭκαλοι and κωμωδοποιοί.11.
Tragedy and comedy were at first ἀυτοϭχεδιαϭκαί, the one resulting ἀπὸ τω̃ν ἐξαϱχόντων τὸν διθύϱαμβον, but the other ἀπο τω̃ν τὰ φαλλικά ;
they then gradually increased, as im­ provements presented themselves.
13.
AEschylus added a second actor,.
and gave the pre-emi­ nence to the dialogue (see, however, the note).
Sophocles added a third, and introduced scenic decoration.
While tragedy remained in its simple, satyric state, the Trochaic metre was employed;
but, on its improvement, the Iambic, as being the most naturally adapted to every-day discourse.
The Trochaic Poetry was ϭατυϱικὴ καὶ ὀρχηϭτικωτερὴ, but τὸ ὶαμβει̃ον μάλιϭτα λεκτκὸν τω̃ν μέτϱων.
1 o. Episodes were also multiplied, and the other parts im­ proved.
2. The progress of comedy, from its being for a long time unpopular, is unknown, but its poets are known from the time when it began to possess any form.
3.
The inventor of masks, dialogues, and an increased num­ ber of actors is likewise unknown.
But Epicharmus and Phormis of Sicily first invented comic fables, but Crates was the first Athenian who began ἀφέμενος Tric ἰαμβικη̄ς ἰδέας καθόλου ποιει̃ν λόγους καὶ μύθους, to introduce dialogues and plots of a regular character.
4. Tragic Poetry and epic agree in imitating τοὺς ϭπου­ δαίους, but epic differs from it τῳ̃ τὸ μέτϱον ἁπλοῡν ἔχειν καὶ ἀπαγγελίαν εἶαι, and also τῳ̃ μήκει.
For epopee is ἀόριϭτος τῳ̃ χϱόνῳ, but tragedy ὑπὸ μίαν περιοδον ἡλίου.
But at first there was no such restriction.5.
-As all the parts of epic Poetry are found in tragic, (but not vice versâ,) a judge of the former will be a judge of the latter also.
5.
And since action cannot exist but by η̉θοςand διανοία, which are its two causes, , καί κατα ταύτας καί τυγχάνουσι και7.
Hence there are six parts of tragedy, as far as its quality9.
The most important is ̔η rwv πραγμάτων σύστυσις, for tragedy imitates actions, not men, and manners only as far as they are involved by actions.
Hence action is the τέλος of tragedy.
11. For it may exist without manners, but cannot without action:
the later authors are imperfect in manners.
12. Nor would a whole string of well mannered incidents please so well as a regular plot.
men arrive at perfection in diction and manners, sooner than in constructing plots.
[The rest of this chapter is a repeti­ tion, and is inconsistent with Aristotle's own ideas in other places.
See Ritter.]VII.—2. From the previous definition, κείται ήμίν τήν these definitions the poet must conform.
4. Again, whatever is beautiful, must not only have a pro­ per arrangement of its parts, but must be of a proper magni­ tude, neither too large for its parts to be comprehended, nor too small.
VIII.—1. Μυ̃θος is one, not έὰν περὶ ε̎ναη̨̉, as the authors of Heracleids, etc. have wrongly supposed, but because it is the imitation of one entire action, complete in all its parts.
IX.—1. Moreover it is not the poet's province to relate τὰ uvaYKaiov.
For this is the proper difference between the historian and poet, not the use of metre.
3.
And poetry is more philosophical than history, because it regards ra καθόλου, but history τὰ καθ̛ ε̋κατον.5.
Hence comic writers use names of their own invention, but tragedians τω̃ν , γενομένων όνομάτω αντέχοντατ, at least one or two in each play.
Kat tyofitptiv ical έλεενών that which is wonderful must also have some appearance of cause, rather than of being άπὸ του̃ αὺτομάτου καὶ τη̃ς τύχης, for even casual events are most won­ derful when they seem to be from design.
X.—1. Plots, like actions, are either ἁπλοὶ or πεπλεγμένοι.3.
there are also others, but the above is best, as pro­ ducing ε̋λεον ἣ φόβον.5.
And since discoveries are relative, they are sometimes of one, sometimes of both the persons.
XII. [ Of doubtful authority.
The following, however, are the definitions of the parts of quantity.
1. 7rpoXoyoc, μέροςXIII.—2.
The poet should aim at a plot that is πεπλεγμένη, and φοβερῶν καὶ ἐλεεινω̃ν μιμητική.
He should not represent τοὺς ἐπιεικεῑς changing from happiness to misery, οὺ γὰρ φοβε­ ρὸν, οὐδὲ ἐλεεινὸν τοῡτο, ἀλλὰ μιαρόν ἐστιν, nor yet the con­ trary, for the fall of the wicked does not excite pity or fear, but only τὸ φιλάνθρωπον.3.
The best subject for tragedy is όμήτε
ἀρετῄ διαφέρων, καὶ confined to the adventures of a few families.
6.
Euripides, from his plots ending unhappily, is unduly blamed.
7.
But a happy end pleases the weak feelings of the spec­ tators, as also does the διπλη̄ σύστασις, where the play ends in a contrary result to the good and bad.
8.
But this is better suited to comedy.
XIV.—1. Scenic decoration may excite terror and pity, but they should rather arise ἐξ αὐτη̄ς τη̄ς συστάσεως τῶν πραγμάτων, which is far better, and more suitable to the poet's art.4.
Now, terrible actions must be either between friends, enemies, or persons indifferent.
But if an enemy kill an enemy, οὐδὲν ἐλεεινὸν, as also with indifferent persons.
But it is between friends and relations that such events become piteous.
5.
Now, we must not essentially alter the received subjects of tragedy, but we must invent new ones, and use the old judiciously.
6.
Now, this may be done in the following ways:
I. ειδότας καὶ γιγνώσκοντας, as Medea.
2. ἀγνοοῡντας τὸ δεινὸν, εἶθ’XV.
Four requisites of τὰ ἤθη.
1. ὅπς χρηστὰἦἕξειΙf
And hence the development of a plot should arise out of the plot itself, not out of the machinery, which should be confined to τὰ ἔξω τοῡδράματος, things happening before or after the time of action.
And ἄλογον μηδὲνεἶναιἐν τοῑς πράγμσιν, but if so, ἔξωτη̃ςτραγωδιας.8.
Like good painters, we must improve upon the original we imitate.
XVII.—1. The poet should put himself as much as possi­ ble in the place of a spectator.
3.
He should first draw out a general sketch of the subject, then add the episodes, taking care that they belong properly to the subject.
They are short in tragedy, but serve to lengthen out an epic poem.
XVIII.
[Doubtful.
Every tragedy consists of two parts:
4. Both effects are produced by a judicious use of αἱἐπεκ­ τάσεις καὶ ἀποκοπαὶ, καὶ ἐξαλλαγαὶ τω̃ν ὀνομάτων.9.
But a judicious use of metaphors is the greatest excel­ lence of all, for it cannot be derived from another, and is a sign10.
TO.
διπλα̃ are best suited to dithyrambs.
γλω̃τται, to heroic verse.
μεταφοραὶ, to Iambic.
But heroic verse admits of all these kinds.
Iambic should approach as much as possible to the diction of common life.
XXIII.
In narrative and hexameter verse, the story ought to be dramatically constructed, as in tragedy, i. e. it should be from history, which treats of events of one time, not of one action.
3.
Hence the excellent management of Homer in not at­ tempting to bring the whole war into his poem, but only taking one part, filling it out with episodes.
XXIV.
The epic poem should also agree with the tragic as to its kinds [simple or complicated, moral or disastrous?].
Its parts are also the same, except μελοποιΐαand ὄψις, for it must have περιπετείαι, ἀναγνωρίσεις, παθήματα, διανοίαι, and λέξις, suitably arranged, as in Homer, ἡ μὲν Ιλιὰς, ἁπλου̃ν και3.
It also differs in length.
4.
For it has the advantage of being extended by narrative of many simultaneous actions, which increase the ὄγκος rov ποιήματος,and also by different episodes.
6.
A mixture of these metres is absurd.
7. Like Homer, the poet should know when it is fitting for him to speak in person.
8. The θαυμαστὸν is necessary in tragedy, but in epopee even TO ἄλογον is admitted, which is most wonderful, διὰ τ'.9.
And Homer has chiefly taught other poets ψευδη̃ λέγειν ὡς δεĩ, which is by a παραλογισμός on the part of the hearer.
11.
And the diction should be most studied in the idle parts of the poem, where there are neither manners nor senti­ ment.
For these latter are obscured by over-fine diction.
XXV. and XXVI.
[ Very doubtful.
As these two chap ten are quite unintelligible, except in reference to the ex­ amples quoted, it is of little use to analyse them.
