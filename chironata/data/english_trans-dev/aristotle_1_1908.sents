THE investigation of the science of Mind, especially as to its element, Thought, is of so interesting a charac­ ter as in great measure to reconcile the inquirer to the abstruseness of formal reasoning.
The beauty of the flower, whilst concealing the ruggedness, is apt to with­ draw our attention from the utility, of the soil on which it grows;
and thus in like manner the charms of Idealism, ending but too frequently in visionary specu­ lation, have obstructed the clear appreciation of the design and use of Logic.
Not that we deny the con­ nexion which must ever subsist between Logic, as the science of the laws of reasoning, and psychology;
in­ deed the latter is constantly introduced in several topics of the Organon;
but if we would derive real practical benefit from logical study, we must regard it as enun­ ciative of the universal principle of inference, affording a direct test for the detection of fallacy, and the estab­ lishment of true conclusion.
Wherefore, while primarily connected with the lawi of Thought, Logic is secondarily and practically alliec to language as enunciative of Thought.
To enter intc the mental processes incident thereto, though so tempt ing a theme as already to have seduced many from the direct subject of the science, would far exceed the limits of this Introduction.
We shall therefore conten ourselves with a few observations upon the utility o the study connected with the Organon itself.
It is a quaint remark of Erasmus, that the human un.
derstanding, like a drunken clown lifted on horseback falls over on the farther side the instant he is supporte( on the nearer ;
and this is the characteristic of humai praise and censure.
From an ignorant and exaggerate( notion of its purport, Logic, instead of being limited t< its proper sphere, was supposed commensurate with the whole investigation of abstract truth in relation t< matter, cause, and entity,—in fact, the substance of ;
folio volume, describing every phase of human life compressed into a few pages of Boethius and Aldrich Thus, not having effected what nothing short of a mi raculous expansion of the understanding could effect, i sunk into insignificance, until recently vindicated, an< placed upon its proper footing, by Whately, Mansel.
and others.
It is true that, whether viewed as an art or a science Logic does not solve the origin of mental conception;
but it furnishes the rules on which all reasoning is constructed;
and it would be strange indeed if we re­ fused the practical assistance of surgery because it does not exhibit in theory the operation of will upon matter.
We may learn Logic and yet not be able to think;
but the science cannot be blamed for the imperfection of the element worked upon, any more than the artificer for the inferiority of the only material within his reach.
It is sufficient that Logic, without entering into all the phenomena of mind, provides certain forms which an argument, to be legitimate, must exhibit, certain tests by which fallacy may be detected, and certain barriers against ambiguity in the use of language.
Hence, the utility of a science which enables men to take cognizance of the travellers on the mind's highway, and excludes those disorderly interlopers verbal fallacies, needs but small attestation.
Its search­ ing penetration by definition alone, before which even mathematical precision fails,l would especially com­ mend it to those whom the abstruseness of the study does not terrify, and who recognise the valuable results which must attend discipline of mind.
Like a medi­ cine, though not a panacea for every ill, it has the health of the mind for its aim, but requires the de­ termination of a powerful will to imbibe its nauseating yet wholesome influence:
it is no wonder therefore that puny intellects, like weak stomachs, abhor and reject it.
What florid declaimer can endure that the lux­ uriant boughs of verdant sophistry, the rich blossoms of oratorical fervour, should be lopped and pared by the stern axe of a syllogism, and the poor stripped trunk of worthless fallacy exposed unprotected to the nipping atmosphere of truth ?
Like the science of which it treats, not only has the term “Logic " been variously applied,1 but even the Or. ganon, as a whole, presents no great claim to unity
The term is neither found, as belonging to an ari or science, in Aristotle, nor does it occur in the writing:
of Plato, and the appellation “ Organon," given to the treatises before us, has been attributed to the Peripatetics who maintained against the Stoics that Logic was " air instrument" of Philosophy.
The book, according t( M. St. Hilaire, was not called “ Organon " before the 15th century,2 and the treatises were collected into on.
volume, as is supposed, about the time of Andronicus o Rhodes ;
it was translated into Latin by Boethius abou the 6th century.
That Aristotle did not compose the Organon as a whole, is evident from several portion having been severally regarded as logical, gram matical, and metaphysical, and even the Aristotelia names themselves, Analytic and Dialectic, are applica )le only to certain portions of the Organon.
Still the system is so far coherent in the immediate view taken of Logic, as conversant with language in the process of easoning, that any addition to the structure of the Stagirite can never augment the compactness with vhich the syllogism, as a foundation, is built.
The reatises themselves are mentioned under distinct titles )y their author, and subsequent commentators have liscussed the work, not as a whole, but according to its everal divisions.
It is remarkable also, that no quot- Ltions from the Categories, de Interpretatione, or So­ )histical Elenchi, are found in the extant writings of Aristote, since those given by Ritter1 of the first and ast must be considered doubtful.
In the present Translation my utmost endeavour has been to represent the mind and meaning of the author is closely as the genius of the two languages admits.
Che benefit of the student has been my especial object;
tence in the Analysis, the definitions are given in the rery words of Aristotle, and the syllogistic examples, ntroduced by Taylor, have been carefully examined and corrected.
In order also to interpret the more con­ used passages, I have departed somewhat from the Lsual plan, and in addition to foot-notes have affixed explanations in the margin, that the eye may catch, in he same line, the word and its import.
Wherever further elucidation was necessary, I have referred to standard authorities, amongst whom I would gratefully commemorate the works of Mr. Mansel and Dr. Whately, not forgetting my solitary predecessor in this laborious undertaking, Thomas Taylor, whose strict integrity in endeavouring to give the meaning of the text deserves the highest commendation.
For books placed at my disposal I have especially to express my sincere acknowledgments to the Rev. Dr. Hessey, Head Master of Merchant Tailors' School, and John Cuninghame, Esq. of Lainshaw.
By an alteration in the original plan, it has been found requisite, in order to equalize the size of the volumes, to place Porphyry's Introduction at the close, instead of at the commencement, of the Organon.
barstow, June 23, 1853.
THINGS are termed homonymous, of which the 1.
What are name alone is common, but the definition (of sub- homonyms. stance according to the name) is different;
thus " man" and “ the picture of a man ” are each termed “animal," since of these, the name alone is common, but the definition (of the substance according to the name) is different:
1 as if any one were to assign what was in either, to constitute it " animal,” he would allege the peculiar definition of each.
2.
What are synonyms.
But those are called synonyms, of which both the name is common, and the definition (of the sub­ stance according to the name) is the same,2 as both " a man " and " an ox " are " animal," for each of these is predicated of as "animal" by a common name, and the definition of the substance is the same, since if a man gave the reason of each as to what was in either, to constitute 3. Paronyms.
it “animal," he would assign the same reason.
Again, things are called paronyms which, though differing in case, have their appellation (according to name) from some thing, as “a grammarian " is called so from “gram­ mar,” and “a courageous man " from " courage.
"1. Subjects of discourse com­ plex and in­ complex.
OF things discoursed upon, some are enunciated after a complex, others after an incomplex, man­ ner ;
the complex as “ a man runs," " a man con­ quers," but the incomplex as “ man," “ox," " runs," " conquers."
Likewise also some things are predicated of a certain subject, yet are in no 2.

subject, as “the man" is predicated of a subject, i. e. of it some certain man," yet is in no subject.
Others, again, are in a subject, yet are not predicated of any subject, (I mean by a thing being in a subject, that which is in any thing not as a part, but which cannot subsist without that in which it is,) as “a certain grammatical art" is in a sub­ ject, "the soul," but is not predicated of any;
and “this white thing" is in a subject, "the body," (for all "colour" is in " body,") but is predicated of no subject.
But some things are both predicated of and are in a subject, as “sci­ ence" is in a subject-" the soul," but is predicated of a subject, namely, "grammar."
Lastly, some are neither in, nor are predicated of, any subject, as "a certain man" and " a certain horse," for nothing of this sort is either in, or 3.
Individuals, not predicated of a subject.
predicated of, a certain subject.
In short, indi­ viduals, and whatever is one in number, are pre­ dicated of no subject, but nothing prevents some of them from being in a subject, for " a certain grammatical art" is amongst those things which are in a subject, but is not predicated of any subject.
1.
Statement of argument in abstract.
WHEN one thing is predicated of another, as of a subject, whatever things are said of the predi­ cate, may be also said of the subject, 1 as “the man" is predicated of "some certain man," but the animal” is predicated of "the man," wherefore the animal” will be predicated of "some certain man," since the certain man" is 2.
Difference of distinct genera both "man" and “animal”
The differences of different genera, and of things not arranged under each other, are diverse also in species, as of “ani­ mal" and " science."

under them.
mal are "quadruped, "biped, "winged, "aquatic, but none of these, forms the difference of " science," since " sci­ ence, does not differ from "science, in being "biped."
But as to subaltern genera, there is nothing to prevent the differences being the same, S. Not so as to subaltern ge­ nera.
as the superior are predicated of the genera under them ;
so that as many differences as there are of the predicate, so many will there also be of the subject.
OF things in complex enunciated, each signifies either Substance, or Quantity, or Quality, or Re­ lation, or Where, or When, or Position, or Pos- 1.

session, or Action, or Passion.
2 But Substance is, (to speak generally,) as "man," "horse;
" Quantity, as "two" or "three cubits;
" Quality, as "white," a "grammatical thing;
" Relation, as "a double," "a half," "greater;
"
Where, as "in the Forum," "in the Lyceum When, as "yesterday," "last year;
" Position, as "he reclines," "he sits;
" Possession, as " he is shod," “he is armed;
" Action, as " he cuts," " he burns;
" Passion, as "he is cut," "he is burnt."
Now each of the above, considered by itself, is predicated neither affirmatively nor negatively, but from the connexion of these with each other, 2. Categories by themselves.
neither affirm ative nor nega tive.
affirmation or negation arises.
For every affirmation or nega­ tion appears to be either true or false, but of things enun- ciated without any connexion, none is either true or false, as “man,” "white," "runs," "conquers."1. Primary sub­ stance is nei­ ther in, nor is predicated of, any subject.
2. Secondary substances con­ tain the first.
SUBSTANCE, in its strictest, first, and chief sense, is that which is neither predicated of any subject, nor is in any;
as " a certain ,” or " a certain horse."
But secondary substances are they, in which as species, those primarily-named sub­ stances are inherent, that is to say, both these and the genera of these species;
2 as "a certain man exists in “man,” as in a species, but the genus of this species is “animal;
” these, therefore, are termed secondary substances, as both "man" and " animal.”
1
But it is evident from what has been said, that of those things which are predicated of a subject, both the name d the definition must be predicated of the sub­ ject, as “man” is predicated of "some certain 3.

tion the name and definition of the subject must be predi­ cated.
man, as of a subject, and the name, at least, is predicated, for you will predicate "man" of "some certain man," and the definition of man will be predicated of " some certain man,” for "a certain man" is both "man" and "animal;
" where.
4. The contrary happens in the case of many inhesions.
fore both the name and the definition will be pre­ dicated of a subject.
But of things which are in a subject, for the most part, neither the name nor the definition is predicated of the subject, yet with some, there is nothing to prevent the name from being some­ times predicated of the subject, though the definition cannot be so;
as "whiteness" being in a body, as in a subject, is predicated of the subject, (for the body is termed " white,") but the definition of "whiteness" can never be predicated of body.
All other things, however, are either predicated of primary substances, as of subjects, or are inherent in them as in subjects;
1 this, indeed, is evident, from several obvi­ ous instances, thus "animal" is predicated of "man," and therefore is also predicated of some “certain man," for if it \ 5.

were predicated of no "man particularly, nei­ ther could, it be of "man" universally.
Again, “colour” is in "body," therefore also is it in "some certain body," for if it were not in "some one" of bodies singularly, it could not be in " body" universally;
so that all other things are either predicated of primary sub­ stances as of subjects, or are inherent in them as in subjects;
if therefore the primal substances do not exist, it is impossible that any one of the rest should exist.
6.
Species more a substance than genus.
But of secondary substances, species is more substance than genus;
2 for it is nearer to the primary substance, and if any one explain what the primary substance is, he will explain it more clearly and appropriately by giving the species, rather than the genus;
as a person defining "a certain man" would do so more clearly, by giving " man" than " animal," for the former is more the peculiarity of "a certain man," but the latter is more common.
In like manner, whoever explains what “a certain tree" is, will define it in a more known and appropri-

ate manner, by introducing "tree than “plant.
Besides the primary substances, because of their subjection to all other things, and these last being either predicated of them, or being in them, are for this reason, especially, termed substances.
Yet the hence their name.
same relation as the.
primary substances hear to all other things, does species bear to genus, for species is subjected to genus since genera are predicated of species, but species are not reciprocally predicated of genera, whence the species is rather substance than the genus.
Of species themselves, however, as many as are not genera, are not more substance, one than an­ other, for he will not give a more appropriate definition of “a certain man," who introduces 8.

“man," than he who introduces " horse," into the definition of "a certain horse:
" in like manner of primary substances, one is not more substance than another, for "a certain man" is not more substance than a “certain ox."
With reason therefore, after the first substances, of the rest, species and genera alone are termed secondary substances, since they alone declare the primary substances of the predicates;
thus, if any one were 10.
Species and genera alone are secondary substances.
to define what "a certain man" is, he would, by giving the species or the genus, define it appropriately, and will do so more clearly by introducing "man" than "animal;
" but whatever else he may introduce, he will be introducing, in a manner, foreign to the purpose, as if he were to introduce it white," or " runs," or any thing else of the kind, so that with propriety of the others, these alone are termed sub­ stances.
Moreover, the primary substances, be­ cause they are subject to all the-rest, and all the others are predicated of, or exist in, these, are most properly termed substances, but the same relation which the primary substances bear to all other 11.
Equality of relation be­ tween cognate genera and species.
things, do the species and genera of the first substances, bear to all the rest, since of these, are all the rest predicated, foryou will say that " a certain man " is "a grammarian,” and therefore you will call both " man" and " animal" " a grammarian,” and in like manner of the rest.
112.
No sub­ stance in a sub­ ject.
It is common however to every substance, not to be in a subject,1 for neither is the primal substance in a subject, nor is it predicated of any,;
but of the se­ condary substances, that none of them is in a subject, is evident from this;
" man " is predicated of " some certain " subject " man," but is not in a subject, for " man " is not in “a cer­ tain man."
So also " animal" is predicated of " some certain " 13.
Of inhe­ sives the name may be predi­ cated of the subject, but not the definition.
subject “man, but " animal is not in “a certain man."
Moreover of those which are, in the sub­ ject, nothing prevents the name from being some­ times predicated of the subject, but that the defi­ nition should be predicated of it, is impossible.
Of secondary substances however the definition and the name are both predicated of the subject, for you will predicate the 14.
The latter may be predi­ cated of second­ ary substances.
15. Difference does not exist in subject.
definition of " a man concerning " a certain man, and likewise the definition of " animal," so that substance, may not be amongst the number, of those things which are in a subject.
This however is not the peculiarity of sub­ stance, but difference also is of the number of those things not in a subject;
2 for "pedestrian" and "biped" are indeed predicated of "a man" as of a subject, but are not in a subject, for neither "biped" nor "pedestrian" is in "man."
The definition also of differ­ ence is predicated of that, concerning which, difference is pre­ dicated, so that if " pedestrian " be predicated of " man," the definition also of "pedestrian " will be predicated of man, for 16.
Parts of substances are also sub­ stances.
“man " is " pedestrian."
Nor let the parts of sub­ stances, being in wholes as in subjects, perplex us,, so that we should at any time be compelled.
to say, that they are not substances;
for in this manner, things would not be said be in a. subject, which are in any as parts, It happens indeed both to substances and to differences alike, that all things should be predicated of them univocally, for all the cate­ gories from them are predicated either in respect of individuals or of species, since from the primary 17.
Difference and secondary substance pro dicated univo­ cally.
substance there is no category, for it is predicated in respect of no subject.
But of secondary substances, species indeed is predicated in respect of the individual, but genus in respect to species and to individuals, so also differences are predicated as to species and as to individuals.
Again, the primary substances take the definition of species 18.
and of genera, and the species the definition of the genus, for as many things as are said of the predicate, so many also will be said of the subject, likewise both the species and the indi­ viduals accept the definition of the differences:
those things at least were univocal, of which the name is common and the definition the same, so that all which arise from substances and differences are predicated univocally.
Nevertheless every substance appears to signify this particular thing :
1 as regards then the pri­ mary substances, it is unquestionably true that 19.
All sub­ stance signifies some one thing.
they signify aparticular thing, for what is signified is indi­ vidual, and in number, but as regards the secondary sub­ stances, it appears in like manner that they signify this par­ ticular thing, by the figure of appellation, when any one says " man” or “animal,” yet it is not truly so, but rather they signify a certain quality for sub- 20.
Secondary substances sig- nify a certain " quale."
ject is not one, as the primary substance, but " man” and " animal are predicated in respect of many.
Neither do they signify simply a certain quality, as " white,” for " white" signifies nothing else but a thing of a certain quality, but the species and the genus determine the quality, about the substance, for they signify what quality a certain substance possesses:
still a wider limit is made by genus than by species, for whoever speaks of “animal," comprehends more than he who speaks of " man."21. Primary substance ad­ mits no con­ trary.
It. belongs also to substances that there is no contrary to them,1 since what can be contrary to the primary substance, as to a certain " man," or to a certain "animal," for there is nothing contrary either at least to "man" or to " animal?”
Now this is not the peculiarity of substance, but of many other things, as for in- 22.
Other in­ stances.
stance of quantity ;
tor there is no contrary to “two cubits nor to " three " cubits, nor to "ten," nor to any thing of the kind, unless some one should say that It much" is contrary to " little," or " the great" to " the small;
" but of definite quantities, none is contrary to the other.
Sub:
23.
Neither the greater norless.
stance, also, appears not to receive greater or less ;
2 I mean, not that one substance is not, more or less, substance, than another, for it has been already said that it is, but that every substance is not said to be more or less, that very thing, that it is;
as if the same sub stance be " man " he will not be more or less " man;
" neither himself than himself, nor another " man " than another, for one " man " is not more “man " than another, as one " white thing" is more and less " white" than another, and one “beautiful" thing more and less “beautiful" than another, and “the same thing" more or less than “itself;
" so a body being “white," is said to be more " white ” now, than it was before, and if “warm " is said to be more or less “warm."
Substance at least is not termed more or less substance, since " man " is not said to be more "man" now, than before, nor any one of such other things as are substances:
hence substance is not capable of receiving the greater and the less.
It appears however, to be especially the pecu­ liarity of substance, that being one and the same in number, it can receive contraries, which no one can affirm of the rest which are not substances, as that being one in number, they are capable of 24.
Individu­ ally it can re­ ceive contra­ new, in which it differs from those which are not substances.
contraries.
1
Thus " colour, which is one and the same in number, is not " white " and " black," neither the same action, also one in number, both bad and good;
in like manner of other things as many as are not substances.
Put substance being one, and the same in number, can receive contraries, as " a. certain man " being one and the same, is at one time, white, and at another, black, and warm and cold, and bad and good.
In respect of none of the rest does such a thing appear, ex­ cept some one should object, by saying, that a sentence and opinion are capable of receiving contraries, for the same sen­ tence appears to be true and false;
thus if the statement be true that " some one sits," when he stands up, this very same statement will be false.
And in a si­ milar manner in the matter of opinion, for if any one should truly opine that a certain person 25.
Reply to objection by a reference to the mode.
sits, when he rises up he will opine falsely, if he still holds the same opinion about him.
Still, if any one, should even admit this, yet there is a difference in the mode.
For some things in substances, being themselves changed, are capable of contraries, since cold, be­ ing made so, from hot, has changed, for it is changed in quality, and black from white, and 26.
Inherent. in substances are, when changed, capa­ ble of contra­ riety.
good from bad:
in like manner as to other things, each one of them receiving change is capable of contraries.
The sen­ tence indeed and the opinion remain themselves altogether immovable, but the thing being moved, a contrary is pro­ duced about them;
the sentence indeed remains the same, that " some one sits," but the thing being moved, it becomes at one time, true, and at another, false.
Likewise as to opinion, so that in this way, it will be the peculiarity of substance, to receive contraries according to the change in itself, but if any one admitted this, that a sentence and opinion can receive 27.
Induction of passion in the example as to sentence and opinion.
contraries, this would not be true.
For the sen­ tence and the opinion are not said to be capable of contraries in that they have received any thing, but, in that about something else, a passive qua­ lity has been produced, for in that a thing is, or is not, in this, is the sentence said to be true, or false, not in that itself, is capable of contraries.
1
In short, neither is a sen­ tence nor an opinion moved by any thing, whence they can­ not be capable of contraries, no passive quality being in them ;
substance at least, from the fact of itself receiving contraries, is said in this to be capable of contraries, for it receives dis­ ease and health, whiteness and blackness, and so long as it receives each of these, it is said to be capable of receiving contraries.
Wherefore it will be the peculiarity of substance, that being the same, and one in number, according to change in itself, it is capable of receiving contraries ;
and concerning substance this may suffice.
21.
Quantity two-fold, dis-OF Quantity, one kind is discrete, and another continuous ;
4 the one consists of parts, holding position with respect to each other, but the other of parts, which have not that position.
Dis­ crete quantity is, as number and sentence, but continuous, as line, superficies, body, besides place and time.
For, of the parts of number, there is no common term, by which its parts con­ crete and conti­ nuous;
cf parts occupying rela­ tive position, and the con­ trary.
2. Examples discrete.
1. Number.
join, as if five be a part of ten, five and five, conjoin at no common boundary, but are separated.
Three, and seven, also conjoin at no common boundary, nor can you at all take a common limit of parts, in number, but they are always sear­ ated, whence number is of those things which are discrete.
In like manner a sentence, for 2. Oratio.
that a sentence is quantity is evident, since it is measured by a short and long syllable ;
1 but I mean a sentence produced by the voice, as its parts concur at no common limit, for there is no common limit, at which the syllables concur, but each is distinct by itself.
A line, on the contrary, is continuous, for you may take a common term, at which its parts meet, namely, a point, and of a 3.
Examples continuous.
1. A line.
superficies, a line, for the parts of a superficies coalesce in a certain common term.
So also you can take a common term in respect of body, namely, a line, or a superficies, by which the parts of body are joined.

same sort are time and place, for the present time is joined both to the past and to the future.
Again, place is of the number of continuous things, for the 3.
Time and place.
parts of a body occupy a certain place, which parts join at a certain common boundary, wherefore also the parts of place, which each part of the body occupies, join at the same bound­ ary as the parts of the body, so that place will also be con­ tinuous, since its parts join at one common boundary.
Moreover, some things consist of parts, having position with respect to each other, but others of parts not having such position;
2 thus the parts of a line have relative position, for each of them lies 4.
Relative po­ sition of some parts as to the above.
some where, and you can distinguish, and set out, where each lies, in a superficies, and to which part of the rest, it is joined.
So also the parts of a superficies, have a certain position, for it may be in like manner pointed out where each lies, and what have relation to each other, and the parts of a solid, and 5.
Parts have no relation in respect of num­ ber or time.
of a place, in like manner.
On the contrary, in respect of number, it is impossible for any one to show that its parts have any relative position, or that they are situated any where, or which of the parts are joined to each other.
Nor as regards parts of time, for not one of the parts of time endures, but that which does not endure, how can it have any position ?
you would rather say, that they have a certain order, inasmuch as one part of time is former, but another latter.
In the same man­ ner is it with number, because one, is reckoned before two, and two, before three, and so it may have a certain order, but 6. Oratio.
you can, by no means, assume, that it has position.
A speech likewise, for none of its parts en­ dures, but it has been spoken, and it is no longer possible to bring back what is spoken, so that there can be no position of its parts, since not one endures:
some things therefore consist of parts having position, but others of those which 7.
The above- named are the only proper quanta-all others reduci­ ble to these.- Examples.
have not position.
What we have enumerated are alone properly termed quantities;
all the rest being so denominated by accident, for looking to these, we call other things quantities, as white­ ness is said to be much, because the superficies is great, and an action long, because of its time be­ ing long, and motion also, is termed, much.
Yet each of these is not called a quantity by itself, for if a man should explain the quantity of an action, he will define it by time, describing it as yearly, or something of the sort;
and if he were to explain the quantity of whiteness, he will define it by the superficies, for as the quantity of the superficies, so he would say is the quantity of the whiteness ;
whence the par­ ticulars we have mentioned are alone properly of themselves termed quantities, none of the rest being so of itself, but ac­ cording to accident.
Again, nothing is contrary to quantity,1 for in the definite it is clear there is nothing contrary, as to " two cubits " or to " three," 8. Quantity, per se, has no contrary.
or to "superficies," or to any thing of this kind, for there is no contrary to them;
except indeed a man should allege that " much " was contrary to " little," or the " great " to the " small."
Of these however, none is a quantity, but rather be­ longs to relatives, since nothing, itself by itself, is described as great or small, but from its being referred to something else.
A mountain, for instance, is called " little," but a millet seed " large," from the fact of the one being greater, but the other less, in re­ spect of things of the same nature, whence the 9.
Reply to ob­ jection, founded upon the con­ trariety of great to small.
relation is to something else, since if each were called "small" or "great" of itself, the mountain would never have been called "small," nor the seed " large."
We say also that there are it many " men in a village, but " few " at Athens, although these last are more numerous, and " many " in a house, but "few " in a theatre, although there is a much larger number in the latter.
Besides, " two cubits," " three," and every thing of the kind signify quantity, but " great" or " small" does not signify quantity, but rather relation, for the " great" and " small" are viewed in reference to something else, so as evi­ dently to appear relatives.
Whether however any one does, or does not, admit such things to be quantities, still there is no contrary to them, for to that which cannot of itself be assumed, but is referred to another, how 10.
can there be a contrary ?
Yet more, if " great" and " small" be contraries, it will happen, that the same thing, at the same time, receives contraries, and that the 11.
same things are contrary to themselves, for it happens that the same thing at the same time is both " great" and " small."
Something in respect of this thing is " small," but the same, in reference to another, is " large," so that the same thing happens at the same time to be both "great" and " small," by which at the same moment it receives contraries.
Nothing however appears to receive contraries simultane­ ously, as in the case of substance, for this indeed 12.
Simultane­ ous contrariety impossible.
seems capable of contraries, yet no one is at the same time " sick" and " healthy," nor a thing " white " and " black " together, neither does any thing else receive contraries at one and the 13.
same time.
It happens also, that the same things are contrary to themselves, since if the " great" be opposed to the " small," but the same thing at the same time be great and small, the same thing would be contrary to itself, but it is amongst the number of impossibilities, that the same thing should be contrary to itself, wherefore the great is not contrary to the small, nor the many to the few, so that even if some one should say that these do not belong to relatives, but to quantity, still they will have no contrary.
14. The contra­ riety of quan­ tity chiefly subsistent in space.
The contrariety however of quantity seems especially to subsist about place, since men admit " upward " to be contrary to " downward," calling the place toward the middle " downward," because there is the greatest distance from the middle, to the extremities of the world;
1 they appear also to deduce the definition of the other contraries from these, for they define contraries to be those things which, being of the same genus, are most distant from each other.
15.
Quantity is incapable of de­ gree.
Nevertheless quantity does not appear capable of the greater and the less, as for instance " two cubits," for one thing is not more " two cubits" than another;
neither in the case of number, since " three or "five" are not said to be more than "three" or "five," nei­ ther "five" more "five" than "three" "three;
" one time also is not said to be more " time " than another;
in short, of none that I have mentioned is there said to be a greater or a less, wherefore quantity is not capable of the greater and less.
16. But of equality and inequality.
Still it is the especial peculiarity of quantity to be called " equal" and " unequal," 2 for each of the above-mentioned quantities is said to be "equal" and "unequal," thus body is called "equal" and "unequal," and number, and time, are predicated of as "equal" and "unequal;
" likewise in the case of the rest enumerated, each one is denominated "equal" and "unequal."
Of the remainder, on the contrary, such as are not quantities, do not altogether appear to be called " equal" and " unequal," as for instance, disposition is not termed entirely "equal" and "un­ equal," but rather "similar" and "dissimilar;
" and white­ ness is not altogether " equal" and " unequal," but rather "similar" and "dissimilar;
" hence the peculiarity of quan­ tity will especially consist in its being termed " equal" and " unequal."
SUCH things are are termed, "relatives" which are said to be what they are, from belonging to other things, or in whatever other way they may be re- 1. Definition of relatives, and instances.
ferred to something else ;
thus " the greater" is said to be what it is in reference to another thing, for it is called greater than something ;
and " the double " is called what it is in reference to something else, for it is said to be double a certain thing;
and si­ milarly as to other things of this kind.
Such as these are of the number of relatives, as habit,2 disposition, sense, knowledge, po­ sition, for all these specified are said to be what they are, from belonging to others, or however else they are referrible to another, and they are nothing else:
for habit is said to be the habit of some one, knowledge the knowledge of something, position the position of somewhat, and so the rest.
Relatives, therefore,are suchthings,as are said to be what they are, from belonging to others, or which may somehow be referred to an­ other.;
as a mountain is called " great" in comparison with an­ other, for the mountain is called " great" in relation to something, and " like" is said to be like somewhat, and other things of this sort, are similarly spoken of, in relation to something.
Re­ clining, station, sitting, are nevertheless certain positions, and position is a relative;
but to recline, to stand, or to sit, are not themselves positions, but are paronymously denominated from the above-named positions.
2.
Some rela­ tives admit contrariety.
Yet there is contrariety in relatives, as virtue is contrary to vice, each of them being relative, and knowledge to ignorance;
1 but contrariety is not inherent in all relatives, since there is nothing contrary to double, nor to triple, nor to any thing of the sort.
3.
Also degree.
Relatives appear, notwithstanding, to receive the more and the less, for the like and the unlike are said to be so, more and less, and the equal and the on­ equal are so called, more and less, each of them being a relative, for the similar is said to be similar to something, and 4.
Exceptions.
the unequal, unequal to something.
Not that all relatives admit of the more and less, for double is not called more and less double, nor any such thing, but all 5.
Relatives reciprocally convertible.
relatives are styled so by reciprocity, as the servant is said to be servant of the master, and the master, master of the servant;
and the double, double of the half, also the half, half of the double, and the greater, greater than the less, and the less, less than the greater.
In like manner it happens as to other things, except that some­ times they differ in diction by case, as knowledge is said to be the knowledge of something knowable, and what is know­ able is knowable by knowledge:
sense also is the sense of 6.
Except where the attri­ bution of the relation is er­ roneous.
the sensible, and the sensible is sensible by sense.
Sometimes indeed they appear not to recipro­ cate, if that be not appropriately attributed to which relation is made, but here he who attributes errs ;
for instance, a wing of a bird, if it be attributed to the bird, does not reciprocate, for the first is not appropriately attributed, namely "wing" to " bird," since " wing " is not predicated of it so far as it is " bird," but so far as it is "winged," as there are wings of many other things which are not birds, so that if it were appropriately attributed, it would also reciprocate;
as " wing " is the wing of " a winged crea­ ture," and " the winged creature " is " winged " by the " wing."
It is sometimes necessary perhaps even to invent a namne' if there be none at hand, for that to which it may be properly applied:
e. g. if a rudder be attributed to a ship, it is not properly so attri- 7.
Necessity cf sometimes in­ venting a name for the relata.
buted, for a rudder is not predicated of a ship so far as it is " ship," since there are ships without rudders ;
hence they do not reciprocate, inasmuch as aship is not said to be the ship of a rudder.
The attribution will perhaps be more appro­ priate, if it were attributed thus, a rudder is the rudder of something ruddered, or in some other way, since a name is not assigned;
a reciprocity also occurs, if it is appropriately attributed, for what is ruddered, is ruddered by a rudder.
So also in other things ;
the for example, will be more ap­ propriately attributed to something headed, than to animal, for a thing has not a head, so far as it is an animal, since there are many animals which have not a head.
Thus any one may easily assume those things to which names are not given, if from those which are first, he assigns names to those others also, 8. Rule for no­ mination of re­ ciprocals.
with which they reciprocate,2 as in the cases adduced, "winged" from "wing," and "ruddered" from "rudder."
An relatives therefore, if they be properly attri­ buted, are referred to reciprocals, si nce if they are referred to something casual,and not to that 9.
All proper relatives reci­ procate.
to which they relate, they will not reciprocate.
I mean, that neither will any one of those things which are admitted to be referrible to reciprocals, reciprocate, even though, names ba assigned to them, if the thing be attributed to something ac-­ cidental, and not to that to which it has relation:
for ex- ample, a servant, if he be not attributed as the servant of a master, but of a man, of a biped, or any thing else of the kind, will not reciprocate, for the attribution is not appropriate.
If however that, to which something is referred, be appropri­ ately attributed, every thing else accidental being taken away, and this thing alone being left, to which it is appropri­ ately attributed, it may always be referred to it, as "a servant," if he is referred to " a master," every thing else ac­ cidental to the master being left out of the question, (as the being " a biped," and " capable of knowledge," and that he is "a man,") and his being "a master" alone, left, here the "servant" will always be referred to him, for a "servant" is said to be the servant of a " master."
If again, on the other hand, that to which it is at any time referred is not ap­ propriately attributed, other things being taken away, and 10.
So that the existence of one depends upon the other.
Vide infra, 13.
that alone left, to which it is attributed, in this case it will not be referred to it.
For let a " serv­ ant " be referred to " man," and a " wing to " bird," and let the being " a master " be taken away from " man," the servant will no longer refer to man, since "master not existing, neither does "serv­ ant" exist.
So also let " being winged" be taken away from " bird," and " wing " will no longer be amongst relatives, for what is " winged " not existing, neither will " wing " be the wing of any thing.
Hence it is necessary to attribute that, to which a thing is appropriately referred, and if indeed a name be already given to it, the application is easy;
but if no name be assigned, it is perhaps necessary to invent one;
but being thus attributed, it is clear that all relatives are referred to reciprocals.
11. Relatives by nature si­ multaneous, with some ex­ ceptions.
Naturally, relatives appear simultaneous, and this is true of the generality of them, for " double" and "half" are simultaneous, and "half" existing, " double " exists, and " a master" existing, the " serv­ ant " is, and the " servant" existing, the "master" is, and other things are also like these.
These also are mutually subversive, for if there is no "double" there is no "half," and no "half" there is no "double " ;
likewise as to other things of the same kind.
It does not however appear to be true of, all re- 12.
As science and its object, apparently.
latives, that they are by nature simultaneous, for the object of "science" may appear to be prior to " science," since for the most part we derive science from things pre-existing, as in few things, if even in any, do we see science and its object originating together.
Moreover, the object of science being subverted, co-subverts the science, but science being sub­ verted, does not co-subvert the object of science, 13.
Sometimes, but not always, co-subversive.
for there being no object of science, science itself becomes non-existent, (since there will be no longer a science of any thing);
;
1but on the contrary, though science does not exist, there is nothing to prevent the object of science existing.
Thus the quadrature of the circle, if it be an object of scientific knowledge, the science of it does not yet exist, though it is itself an object of science :
2 again, " animal" being taken away, there will not be " science, but still it is possible for many objects of science to be.
Likewise also do things pertaining to sense subsist, since the sens- 14.
Instance of things pertain­ ing to sense.
ible seems to be prior to the sense, as the sensible being sub­ verted co-subverts sense, but sense does not co-subvert the sensible.
For the senses are conversant with body, and are in body, but the sensible being subverted, body also is subverted, (since body is of the number of sensibles,) and body not existing, sense also is subverted, so that the sensible co-subverts sense.
Sense on the other hand does not co-subvert the sensible, since if animal were subverted, sense indeed would be subverted, but yet the sensible will remain ;
such for instance as "body," “ warm," " sweet," " bitter," and every thing else which is sensible.
Be­ sides, “ sense " is produced simultaneously with what is "sensi­ tive," for at one and the same time " animal" and " sense " are produced, but the “ sensible " is prior in existence to " animal" or “ sense," for fire and water, and such things as animal con­ sists of, are altogether prior to the existence of animal or sense, so that the sensible will appear to be antecedent to sense.
15.
Primary substance has no relation.
It is doubtful however whether no substance is among the number of relatives, as seems to be the case, or whether this happens in certain second sub­ stances ;
for it is true in first substances, since neither the wholes, nor the parts, of first substances are relative. "
A cer­ tain man " is not said to be a certain man of something, nor " a certain ox" said to be a certain ox of something;
and so also with respect to the parts, for a " certain hand” is not said to be a cer­ tain hand of some one, but the hand of some one;
and some head is not said to be a certain head of some one, but the head of some one, and in most secondary substances the like occurs.
Thus man is not said to be the man of some one, nor an ox the ox of some one, nor the wood the wood of some one, but they are said to be the possession of some one ;
in such things therefore, it is evident, that they are not included amongst re- 16.
But some secondary sub­ stances seem to possess rela­ tion, but the question is solved by an analysis of the definition of τω̃ν πρός, τι. latives.
In the case of some secondary substances there is a doubt, as " head” is said to be the head of some one, and “ hand,” the hand of some one, and in like manner, every such thing, so that these may appear amongst the number of relatives.
Ifthen the definition of relatives has been sufficiently framed, it is either a matter of difficulty, or of impossibility, to show that no substance is relative;
1 but if the definition has not been sufficiently framed, but those things are relatives, whose substance is the same, as consists with a relation, after a certain manner, to a certain thing ;
somewhat, perhaps, in reply to this, may be stated.
The former definition, however, concurs with all relatives, yet it is not the same thing, that their being, consists in relation, and that being what they are, they are predicated of other things.
Hence it is clear, that he who knows any one relative, definitely, will also know what it is referred to, definitely.
Wherefore also 17.
One rela­ tive being known, the co­ relative can be known.
from this it is apparent, that if one knows this particular thing to be among relatives, and if the substance of relatives is the same, as subsisting in a certain manner, with reference to something, he will also know that, with reference to which, this particular thing, after a certain manner, subsists ;
for if, in short, he were ignorant of that, with reference to which, this particular thing, after a certain manner, subsists, neither would r he know, whether it subsists, after a certain manner, with re­ ference to something.
And in singulars, indeed, this is evident -, for if any one knows definitely, 18.
Singulars.
that this thing is he will also forthwith know that, definitely, of which it is the double, since if he knows not that it is the double, of something definite, neither will he know that it is "double," at all.
So again, if a man knows this thing, to be more beautiful than something else, he must straightway and definitely know that, than which, it is more beautiful.
Wherefore, he will not indefinitely know, that this, is better, than that which is worse, for such is opinion and not science, since he will not accurately know that it is better than something worse, as it may so happen that there is nothing worse than it, whence it is necessarily evident, that whoever definitely knows any relative, also definitely knowa that, to which it is referred.
It is possible, notwithstanding, to know definitely what the head, and the hand, and every thing of the sort are, which are substances;
but it is not necessary 19.
The con­ verse true of secondary sub­ stances.
to know that to which they are referred, since it is not neces­ sary de finitely to know whose, is the heady, or whose, is the hand ;
thus these will not be relatives, but if these be not relatives, we may truly affirm no substance to be among re­ latives.
It is, perhaps, difficult for a man to assert assuredly any thing of such matters, who has not frequently considered them, yet to have submitted each of them to inquiry, is not without its use.
11. Quality and its species;
the latter of four kinds.
1st, Habit and disposition- these ex­ plained.
By quality, I mean that, according to which, cer. tain things, are said to be, what they are.
Quality, however, is among those things which are predi­ cated multifariously;
hence one species of quality is called "habit" and "disposition," but habit, differs from disposition, in that it is a thing more lasting and stable.
3
Of this kind too, are both the sciences and the virtues,4 for science appears to rank among those things, which continue more stable, and are hardly removed, even when science is but moderately attained, unless some great change should occur from disease, or from something of the sort;
so also virtue, as justice, temperance, and so forth, does not appear capable of being moved or changed with facility.
But those are termed dispositions, which are easily moved and quickly changed, as heat, cold, disease, health, and such things;
or a man is disposed, after a manner, accord­ ing to these, but is rapidly changed, from hot becoming cold, and from health passing to disease, and in like manner as to other things, unless some one of these qualities has, from length of time, become natural, immovable, or at least dif­ ficult to be moved, in which case we may term it a habit.
But it is evident that those ought to be called habits, which are more lasting, and are with greater difficulty removed, for those persons who do not very much retain the dogmas of science, but are easily moved, are said not to possess a scientific habit, although they are in some manner disposed as to science, either worse or better ;
so that habit differs from disposition in the one being easily removed, but the former is more lasting, and less easily removed.
Habits are dispositions also,1 but dispositions not necessarily habits, for those who have habits are also, after a manner, disposed according to them, but those who are disposed are not altogether possessed of the habit.
Another kind of quality is, that, according to which, we say that men are prone to pugilism, or to the course, or to health, or to disease, in short, whatever things are spoken of according to 2nd species of quality, that which compre­ hends the fa­ culties.
natural power, or weakness;
for each of these is not denomi­ nated from being disposed after a certain manner, but from having a natural power or inability of doing something easily, or of not suffering ;
thus, men are called pugilistic, or fitted for the course, not from being disposed after a certain man­ tier, but from possessing a natural power of doing something easily.
Again, they are said to be healthy, from possessing a natural power of not suffering easily from accidents, but to be diseased, from possessing a natural incapacity to resist suffer­ ing easily from accidents:
similarly to these, do hard and soft subsist, for that is called “hard” which possesses the power of not being easily divided, but" soft," that which has an impo­ tence as to this same thing.
The third kind of quality consists of passive qua­ lities and passions, and such are sweetness, bitter- Srd, Passive qualities.
ness, sourness, and all their affinities, besides warmth, and cold­ ness, and whiteness, and blackness.
Now that these are qualities, is evident from their recipients being called from them, “qua­ lia,”1 as honey from receiving sweetness, is said to be sweet, and the body white, from receiving whiteness;
in like manner in other things.
They are called passive qualities,2 not from the re­ cipients of the qualities suffering any thing, for neither is honey said to be sweet from suffering any thing, nor any thing else of such a kind.
In like manner to these are heat and cold called passive qualities, not from the recipients themselves suffering any thing, but because each of the above-mentioned qualities produces passion in the senses, they are denominated passive qualities ;
for as sweetness, produces a certain passion in the taste, and warmth, in the touch, so also do the rest.
Whiteness,
1. Exception in the case of co­ lours.
and blackness, and other colours are, on the con­ trary, not called passive qualities in the same man­ ner with the above-mentioned, but from themselves being produced from passion;
for that many changes of co­ lours spring from passion is evident, since when a man blushes he becomes red, and when frightened, pale, and so every thing of this sort.
Whence also if a man naturally suffers a passion of this nature, he will probably have a similar colour, since the disposition which is now produced about the body when he blushes, may also be produced in the natural constitution, so as that a similar colour should naturally arise.
Whatever such symptoms then originate from certain passions diffi- cult to be removed and permanent are called passive qualities.
For whether in the natural constitution, paleness, or blackness, be produced, they are called qualities, (for according to them we are called "quales;
") or whether through long disease or heat, or any such thing, paleness or blackness happens, nei­ ther are easily removed, or even remain through life, these are called qualities, for in like manner, we are called " quales " in respect of them.
Notwithstanding, such as are produced from things easily dissolved, and quickly restored, are called passions,1 and not qualities, 2. There may be παθη.
for men are not called "quales" in respect of them, since neither is he who blushes, in consequence of being ashamed, called red, nor he who turns pale, from fear, called pale, they are rather said to have suffered something, so that such things are called passions, but not qualities.
Like these also are passive qualities, and passions denominated in the soul.
For such things as supervene immediately 3.
Also affec­ tions of the soul.
upon birth from certain passions difficult of removal, are called qualities;
as insanity, anger, and such things, for men ac­ cording to these are said to be " quales," that is, wrathful and insane.
So also as many other mutations as are not natural, but arise from certain other symptoms, and are with difficulty removed, or even altogether immovable, such are qualities, for men are called " quales " in respect of them.
Those which, on the other hand, arise from things easily and rapidly restored, are called passions, as for instance, where one being vexed becomes more wrathful, for he is not called wrathful who is more wrathful in a passion of this kind, but rather he is said to have suffered something, whence such things are called passions, but not qualities.
2
The fourth kind of quality is figure and the form, which is about every thing, besides rectitude and curvature, and whatever is like them, for accord- 4th species of quality- form and figure.
ing to each of these a thing is called " quale."
Thus a tri.
angle or a square is said to be a thing of a certain quality, also a straight line or a curve, and every thing is said to be " quale" according to form.
The rare and the dense, the rough and the smooth, may appear to signify a certain quality, but probably these are foreign from the division of quality, as each appears rather to denote a certain position of parts.
For a thing is said to be " dense," from having its parts near each other, but" rare," from their being distant from each other, and " smooth," from its parts lying in some respect in a right line, but " rough," from this part, rising, and the other, falling.
5.
Things call­ ed qualia paro­ nymously from these qualities.
There may perhaps appear to be some other mode of quality, but those we have enumerated are most commonly called so.
The above-named therefore are qualities, but " qualia are things denominated paronymously according to them, or in some other manner from them;
most indeed and nearly all of them are called paronymously,1 as "a white man" from "whiteness," " a grammarian" from " grammar," a "just man " from "justice," and similarly of the rest.
Still in some, from no names having been given to the qualities, it is impossible that they should be called paronymously from them;
for instance, a " racer" or " pugilist," so called from natural power, is paronymously denominated from no quality, since names are not given to those powers after which these men are called " quales," as they are given to sciences, according to which men are said to be pugilists or wrestlers from disposition, for there is said to be a pugilistic and palæstric science, from which those dis­ posed to them are paronymously denominated "quales."
Sometimes however, the name being assigned, that which is called " quale " according to it, is not denominated parony­ mously, as from virtue, a man is called worthy, for he is called worthy, from possessing virtue, but not paronymously from virtue;
this however does not often happen, wherefore those things are called " qualia," which are paronymously denomin­ ated from the above-mentioned qualities, or which are in some other manner termed from them.
2
In quality, there is also contrariety,1 as justice is contrary to injustice, and whiteness to black­ ness, and the like;
also those things which sub­ sist according to them are termed qualia, as the 6.
Quality sometimes sus­ ceptible of con. trariety.
unjust to the just, and the white to the black.
This however does not happen in all cases, for to the yellow, or the pale, or such like colours, though they are qualities, there is no con­ trary.
2
Besides, if one contrary be a quality, the other, will also be a quality, and this is evident to any one con­ sidering the other categories.
For instance, if justice be contrary to injustice, and justice be a quality, then injustice will also be a quality, for none of the other categories accords with injustice, 7. If one con­ trary be a quale the other will be a quale.
neither quantity, nor relation, nor where, nor in short any thing of the kind, except quality, and the like also happens as to quality in the other contraries.
Qualia also admit the more and the less,3 as one thing is said to be more or less " white " than another, and one more and less " just" than another;
the same thing also itself admits accession, for what is ""white," can be­ come more, it white."
This however, does not hap- 8. It can also admit degree, but not always pen with all, but with most things, for some one may doubt whether justice, can be said to be more or less justice, and so also in other dispositions, since some doubt about such, and as­ sert that justice cannot altogether be called more and less, than justice, nor health than health, but they say, that one man has less health, than another, and one person less justice, than an­ other, and so also of the grammatical and other dispositions.
Still the things which are denominated according to these, do without question admit the more and the less, for one man is said to be more grammatical, than another, and more healthy, and Form incapable of degree.
(Cf. Whately, b. ii. c. 5, sec. 6.) more just, and similarly in other things.
in­ angle and square appear nevertheless incapable of the more, as also every other figure, since those things which receive the definition of a triangle, and of a circle, are all alike triangles or circles, but of things which do not receive the same definition, none can be said to be more such, than another, as a square, is not more a cir­ cle, than an oblong, for neither of them admits the definition of the circle.
In a word, unless both receive the definition of the thing propounded, one cannot be said to be more so and so, than another, wherefore all qualities do not admit the more and the less.
9.
It is the pro­ perty of quality.
that similitude is predicated in respect of it.
Of the above-mentioned particulars then, no one is peculiar to quality, but things are said to be similar, and dissimilar, in respect of qualities alone, for one thing is not like another in respect of any thing else, than so far as it is quale, so that it will be peculiar to quality, that the like and the unlike should be termed so in respect of it.
1
Yet we need not be disturbed lest any one should say that, 10.
Reply to objection-that habit and dis­ position are reckoned amongst rela­ tives as well as amongst qua­ lities.
proposing to speak of quality, we co-enumerate many things which are relatives, for we said that habits and dispositions are among the number of re­ latives, and nearly in all such things the genera are called relatives, but not one of the singulars.
Sci­ ence, for example, although it is a genus, is said to be what it is, with respect to something else, for it is said to be the science of a certain thing, but of singulars not one is said to be what it is, with reference to something else, as neither grammar is said to be the grammar of something, nor music the music of something.
But even perhaps these, are called relatives, according to genus, as grammar is said to be the science of something, not the grammar of something, and music the science of something, not the music of some- thing;
so that singulars are not of the number of relatives.
Still, we are called quales from singulars,1 for these we possess, as we are called scientific from possessing certain singular sciences ;
so that these may be singular qualities, according to which we are sometimes denominated quales, but they 11.
Singulars not included amongst rela­ tives.
(Cf. Hill's Logic, de Divi­ sione.) are not relatives ;
besides, if the same thing should happen to be both a particular quality and a relative, there is no absurdity in its enumeration under both genera.
ACTION and Passion admit contrariety, and the more and the less, for to make warm, is contrary to making cold ;
to be warm, contrary to the being cold, to be pleased, contrary to being grieved;
so 1.
Action and Passion admit contrariety and degree.
that they admit contrariety, They are also capable of the more and the less, for it is possible to heat, more and less, to be heated, more and less, and to be grieved, more and less ;
where­ fore, to act, and to suffer, admit the more and less, and so much may be said of these.
But we have spoken of the being situ­ ated in our treatment of relatives,2 to the effect that it is paronymously denominated, from positions :
as re­ gards the other categories, when, where, and to have, nothing else is said of them, than what was 2.
Recapitula­ tion of the other categories.
mentioned at first, because they are evident;
e. g. that "to have," signifies to be shod, to be armed ;
" where," as in the Lyceum, in the Forum, and the rest which are spoken of these.
Of the proposed genera therefore, sufficient has been stated.
1.
Opposites are of four kinds.
WE must now speak of opposites, in how many ways opposition takes place.
One thing then is said to be opposed to another in four ways, either as relative, or as contrary, or as privation and habit, or as affirmation and negation.
Thus speaking summarily, each thing of this kind is opposed, relatively, as " the double " to " the half," contrarily, as "evil" to "good," privatively and habitually, as " blindness " and " sight," affirmatively and ne­ gatively, as " he sits," " he does not sit.
"1. Relative op­ position.
W hatever things then are relatively opposed, are said to be what they are with reference to opposites, or are in some manner referred to them, as " the double of the half," is said to be what it is, with reference to something else, for it is said to be the double of something ;
and " knowledge " is opposed relatively to the object of knowledge, and is said, to be what it is, in reference to what may be known, and what may be known, is said to be what it is, in reference to an opposite, namely, " knowledge," for " the ob­ ject of knowledge " is said to be so, to something, namely, to "knowledge.
"Things therefore relatively opposed are said to be, what they are, with reference to opposites, or in whatever manner, they are referrible to each other, but those which are opposed as contraries, are by no means, said to be what they are, with reference to each other, 2. Contrary opposition.
but are said to be contrary to each other, for neither is "good" said to be the "good" of "evil," but the contrary of evil, nor is "white," denominated the "white"of "black," but its contrary, so that these oppositions differ from each other.
Such contraries however, as are of that kind, that one of them must necessarily be in those things, in which it can naturally be, or of which it is predicated, these have nothing intermediate;
but in the case of those, in which it is not necessary, that one should be inherent, there is something intermediate.
For instance, health and disease may na­ turally subsist in the body of an animal, and it is necessary that one, should be therein, either disease, or health ;
the odd and even are also predicated of number, and one of the two, either the odd or the even, must necessarily be in number, yet there is nothing intermediate between these, neither between disease and health, nor between the odd and the even.
Those contraries, again, have something intermediate, in which one of them need not be inherent, as black and white are naturally in body, but it is not necessary, that one of these, should be inherent in body, for every body, is not white or black.
Vileness, also and worth, are predicated of man, and of many others, yet one of these, need not be in those things of which it is predicated, for not all things are either vile or worthy ;
at least, there is something intermediate, as between white and black, there is dark brown, and pale, and many other colours, but between vileness and worth, that, is intermediate, which is neither vile, nor worthy.
In some instances, the inter­ mediates have names, thus, the dark brown, and the pale, and such colours are media between white and black, but in other cases, it is not easy to assign a name to the intermediate, but the latter is defined, by the negation of either extreme, as, for exam­ ple, whatever is neither good nor bad, nor just nor unjust.
1Privation, however, and habit are predicated 3. Opposition of habit and privation.
of something identical, as sight and blindness of the eye, and universally, in whatever the habit is natu­ rally adapted to be produced, of such is either predicated.
We say then, that each of the things capable of receiving habit is deprived of it, when it is not in that, wherein it might naturally be, and when it is adapted naturally to possess it;
thus we say that a man is toothless, not because he has no teeth, and blind, not because he has no sight, but because he has them not, when he might naturally have them, for some persons from their birth, have neither sight nor teeth, yet they are neither called tooth-

less nor blind.
To be deprived of, and to possess habit, then, are not privation and habit, for the sight is habit, but the privation is blindness, but to possess sight is not sight, nor to be blind, blind­ ness, for blindness is a certain privation, but the being blind is to be deprived, and is not privation, for if blindness were the same as being blind, both might be predicated of the same person, but a man is said to be blind, yet he is never called blindness.
To be deprived also, and to possess habit, appear to be similarly opposed, as privation and habit, since the mode of opposition is the same, for as blindness is opposed to sight, so likewise is the being blind, opposed to the possession of sight.
'4. Opposition of affirmative and negative.
Neither is that, which falls under affirmation and negation, affirmation and negation ;
for affirmation is an affirmative sentence, and negation a negative sentence, but nothing which falls under affirmation and nega­ tion is a sentence (but a thing).
Still these are said to be mutually opposed, as affirmation and negation, since in them the mode of opposition is the same, for as affirmation is some­ times opposed to negation, for example, "he sits" to "he doer not sit," so that thing which is under each is opposed, as " sitting " to " not sitting.
"But that privation and habit, are not opposed as relatives, is evident, since what a thing is, is not asserted of its opposite, for sight is not the sight of blindness, nor in any other way spoken 5.
Privation and habit not relatively op­ posed.
in reference to it, so also blindness, cannot be called the blind­ ness of sight, but blindness indeed is said to be the privation of sight, not the blindness of sight.
Moreover, all relatives are referred to reciprocals, so that if blindness were relative, it would reciprocate with that to which it is referred, but it does not reciprocate, for sight is not said to be the sight of blindness.
From these things, also, it is manifest that those which are predicated, according to privation and habit, are not contrarily opposed, for of contraries which have no intermediate, one must always necessarily be (2.)
Nor con­ trarily.
inherent, wherein it is naturally adapted to be inherent, or of which it is predicated, but between these, there is no inter­ mediate thing wherein it was necessary that the one should be in what was capable of receiving it, as in the case, of disease and health, in odd and the even number.
Of those however between which there is an intermediate, it is never necessary that one should be inherent in every thing ;
for neither is it necessary that every thing capable of receiving it, should be white or black, or hot or cold, since there is no prevention to an interme­ diate being between them.
Again, of these also there was a cer­ tain medium, of which it was not requisite that one should be in its recipient, unless where one is naturally inherent, as in fire to be hot, and in snow to be white:
still in these, one, must of necessity be definitely inherent, and not in whatever way it may happen, for neither does it happen that fire is cold, nor that snow is black.
1
Wherefore it is not necessary that one of them should be in every thing capable of receiving it, but only in those wherein the one is naturally inherent, and in these, that which is definitely and not casually, one.
In privation however, and habit, neither of the above-men­ tioned particulars is true, since it is not always necessary that one should be inherent in what is capable of receiv­ ing it, as what is not yet naturally adapted to have sight, 6. Nature of intermediates in respect to opposition.
is neither said to be blind nor to have sight;
wherefore these things will not be of such contra­ ries as have nothing intermediate.
But neither, on the other hand, will they be amongst those which have something intermediate, since it is necessary that at some time, one of them, should be inherent in every thing ca­ pable of receiving it:
thus when a man is naturally fitted to have sight, then he will be said to be blind, or to have sight, and one of these, not definitely, but whichever may happen, since he need not necessarily be blind, nor see, but either, as it may happen.
In respect nevertheless of contraries, which have an intermediate, it is by no means necessary that one, should be inherent in every thing, but in some things, and in these, one of them definitely, and neither casually, so that things which are opposed according to privation and habit, are evi­ dently not in either of these ways opposed, as contraries.
Again, in contraries, when the recipient exists, a change into each other may happen, unless one is naturally inherent in something, as for instance, in fire to be hot.
It is possible also for the healthy to be sick, the white to become black, cold to become hot, (and the hot to become cold) ;
from good it is possible to become bad, and from bad good, for he who is depraved, being led to better pursuits and discourses, advances, though but a little, to be better, and if he once makes an advancement ever so little, he will evidently become either altogether changed, or have made a very great proficiency, 1 since he ever becomes more disposed to virtue, even if he has ob.
tained the smallest, increase, from the beginning.
Wherefore he will probably acquire greater increase, and this perpetually occurring, he will at last be transformed entirely to a contrary habit, unless he be prevented by time ;
but in privation and habit, it is impossible for a mutual change to occur, since it may take place from habit to privation, but from privation to habit is impossible, as neither can he who has become blind, again see, the bald again have hair, nor has the toothless ever yet again got teeth.
Whatever things are opposed, as affirmation and negation, are evidently opposed according to none of the above-mentioned modes, since in these alone it is always necessary that one should be true, but the other false;
1 as neither, is it al­ ways necessary in contraries that one should be 7.
The pecu­ liarity of affir­ mative, and ne­ gative opposi­ tion, that one should be true and the other false.
true but the other false, nor in relatives, nor in habit and privation.
For instance, health and disease, are contrary, yet neither of them is either true or false;
so also the double and the half are relatively opposed, and neither of them is either true or false;
nor in things which are predicated as to priva­ tion and habit, as sight and blindness.
In short, nothing pre­ dicated without any conjunction, is either true or false, and all the above-named are predicated without conjunction.
Not but that a thing of this kind may appear, to happen in contraries, which are predicated conjunctively, for " Socrates is well" is opposed to " Socrates is sick," 2 yet neither in these is it always necessary, that one should be true and the other false, for while Socrates lives, one will be true and the other false, but when he is not alive, both will be false, since neither is it true that Socrates is sick, nor that he is well, when he is not in existence at all.
In privation and habit, then when the sub- - ject is non-existent, neither is true, but when the subject exists, the one is not always true, nor the other false.
"
Socrates sees " is opposed to " Socrates is blind," as privation and habit, and whilst he exists, one need not be true or false, for when he is not naturally fitted to possess them, both are false, but when Socrates does not exist at all, both will thus be false, that he sees, and that he is blind.
In affirmation and negation always, if Socrates be or be not, one will always be false and the other true ;
for it is evident with respect to these two, " Socrates is sick," and " Socrates is not sick," that when he exists one of them is true and the other false;
and in like manner when he does not exist, for in the latter case that he is ill is false, but that he is not ill is true;
so that in those things alone which are affirmatively and negatively opposed will it be the pecu­ liarity that one of them is either true or false.
1. Opposition of good and evil."
EVIL" is of necessity opposed to good, and this is evident from an induction of singulars, as disease to health, and cowardice to courage, and similarly of the rest.
But to evil, at one time, good, is contrary, and at another, evil, for to indigence being an evil, Rhet. b. i. c. 7, and Eth. b. ii. c. 2. excess is contrary, which is also an evil;
in like manner, mediocrity, which is a good, is opposed to each of them.
A man may perceive this in re­ spect of a few instances, but in the majority the contrary to evil is always good.
12. Where one contrary existsAgain, of contraries it is not required, if one is, that the remainder should be;
for when every man is well, there will indeed be health, and not disease, and so also when all things are white, there will be whiteness, but not blackness.
Besides, if Socrates is well" be the contrary of " Socrates is ill," and both cannot possibly be inherent in the It is not neces­ sary that the other should exist-but sometimes one destroys the other.
same subject, it follows, that when one of the contraries exists, the other cannot possibly exist, for " Socrates is well" exist­ ing, " Socrates is ill cannot exist.
1Contraries, however, evidently are, by their na­ ture, adapted to subsist about the same thing, either in species or genus, since disease and health naturally subsist in the body of an animal, but whiteness and blackness simply in body, and jus­ tice and injustice in the soul of man.
S.
Contraries generally inhe­ rent in similar genera or spe­ cies.
Notwithstanding, it is requisite that all contraries be either in the same genus, or in contrary genera, or be ge­ nera themselves ;
for white and black are in the same genus, as "colour" is the genus of them;
but justice and injustice in contrary genera, for It virtue" is the genus of one, but vice " of the other ;
lastly, "good" and "bad"are not in a genus, but are themselves the genera of certain things.
4.
They must be either in the same genus, or in contrary ge­ nera, or be ge­ nera them­ selves.
A THING is said to be prior to another in four respects:
first and most properly, in respect of time, according to which, one is said to be older and more ancient than another, since it is called 1.
Priority fourfold.
Ist, In respect of time.
older and more ancient, because the time is longer.
Next, when it does not reciprocate, according to the consequence of existence:
thus one is prior to two, for two existing, it follows directly that one ex­ ists ;
but when one is, it is not necessary that two should be, hence the consequence of the re- 2nd, When there is no re­ ciprocity as to the conse­ quence of ex­ istence.
mainder's existence does not reciprocate from the existence of the one;
but such a thing appears to be prior, from which the consequence of existence does not reciprocate.
Srd,
In respect of order.
Thirdly, the prior is that predicated according to a certain order, as in the instance of sciences and discourses, for in demonstrative sciences, the prior and the posterior, subsist in order, since the elements are prior in order, to the diagrams, and in grammar, letters are before syllables;
so also of discourses, as the proem is prior, in order, to the narration.
4th, In excel­ lence.
Moreover, besides what we have mentioned, the better and more excellent appear to be prior by nature.
The common people are accustomed to say, that those whom they chiefly honour and especially re­ gard, are prior in their esteem;
1 but this is nearly the most foreign of all the modes, wherefore such are (nearly) the modes of priority which have been enumerated.
2.
Another mode of prior­ ity may be add­ ed, where one thing is the cause of an­ other's exist­ ing.
Besides the above-mentioned, there may yet appear to be another mode of the prior;
as of things reciprocating, according to the consequence of existence, that which in any respect is the cause of the existence of the one, may justly be said to be by nature prior, and that there are, certain things of this kind, is manifest.
For that man exists, reciprocates, according to the consequence of existence, with the true sen­ tence respecting him, since if man is, the sentence is true, by which we say, that man is, and it reciprocates, since if the sentence be true, by which we say that man is, then man is.
Notwithstanding, a true sentence, is by no means the cause of a thing's existence, but in some way, the thing appears the cause of the sentence being true, for in consequence of a thing existing, or not existing, is a sentence said to be true or false.
Wherefore one thing may be called prior to another, according to five modestTHINGS are called simultaneous simply and most properly, whose generation occurs at the same time, for neither is prior or posterior;
these, therefore, are said to be simultaneous as to time.
But by nature those are simultaneous, which re­ ciprocate according to the consequence of exist­ ence, although one, is by no means the cause of the existence of the other, as in the double and I.
Those things are simultane­ ous which at the same time are produced, and which re­ ciprocate, but do not either cause the other's exist­ ence.
the half, for these reciprocate;
thus the double existing, the half also exists, and the half existing, the double exists, but neither is the cause of existence to the other.
Those, also, which being derived from the same genus, are by division mutually opposed, are said to be naturally simultaneous;
1 but they, are said to have a division opposite to each other, which subsist according to the same division;
thus the 2.
Or which as species of the same genus,are opposed in the same relation of division.
winged is opposed to pedestrian and aquatic, as these being derived from the same genus, are by division mutually opposed, for animal is divided into these, viz.
into the winged, the pe­ destrian, and aquatic, and none of these is prior or posterior, but things of this kind appear naturally simultaneous.
Each of these again, may be divided into species, for instance, the winged, the pedestrian, and the aquatic;
wherefore, those will be naturally simultaneous which, derived from the same genus, subsist according to the same division.
But genera are al­ ways prior to species, since they do not reciprocate according to the consequence of existence ;
2 for the aquatic existing, ani­ mal exists, but though animal exists, it is not necessary that the aquatic should.
Hence those are called naturally simultaneous, which in­ deed reciprocate, according to the consequence of existence;
but the one is by no means the cause of existence to the other, which is also the case with things that, derived from the same genus, have by division a mutual opposition;
those, how­ ever, are simply simultaneous whose generation is at the same time.
11. Motion of six kinds.
OF motion, there are six species, generation, cor­ ruption, increase, diminution, alteration, and change of place.
The other motions then evidently differ from each other, for neither is generation, corruption, nor increase, diminu­ tion, nor alteration, change of place, and so of the rest.
In 2. Alteration questionably relative to the rest, this dis­ proved.
the case of alteration however, there is some doubt, whether it be not sometimes necessary that what is altered, be so, in respect to some one, of the other motions, but this is not true, for it hap­ pens that we are altered, as to nearly all the passions, or at least the greater part of them, without any participation of the other motions, for it is not necessary that what is passively moved should be either increased or diminished.
Wherefore, alteration will differ from the other motions, since I st, By no in­ crease or dimi­ nution neces­ sarily occurring in what is al­ tered.
2nd, By no change taking place in quality.
if it were the same, it would be necessary that what is altered, be forthwith increased or dimin­ ished, or follow some of the other motions, but this is not necessary.
Similarly, also, what is in­ creased or moved with any other motion, ought to be altered (in quality);
but some things are increased which are not so altered, as a square is increased when a gnomon3 is placed about it, but it has not become altered (in quality);
and in like manner with other things of this kind, so that these motions will differ from each other.
Nevertheless simply, rest is contrary to motion, the several rests to the several motions, corrup­ tion to generation, diminution to increase, rest 3. Generic and specific contra­ riety to motion.
in place to change in place;
but change to a contrary place seems especially opposed, as ascent to descent, downwards to upwards.
Still it is not easy, to define the contrary to the re­ mainder of these specified motions, but it seems to have no contrary, unless some one should oppose to this, rest according to quality, or change of quality into its contrary, just as in change of place, rest according to place, or change to a contrary place.
For alteration is the mutation of quality, so that to mo­ tion according to quality, will rest according to quality, or change to the contrary of the quality, be opposed;
thus becoming white is opposed to becoming black, since a change in quality occurs, there being an alteration of quality into contraries.
To have, is predicated in many modes;
either as habit and disposition or some other quality, for we are said to have knowledge and virtue;

all these therefore are said to have, as in a vessel;

foreign, for we mean nothing else by having a wife, than that she cohabits with a man;
there may perhaps appear to be some other modes of having, but those usually mentioned have nearly all been enumerated.
1.
Things enun­ elated by the voice are sym­ bols of the pas­ sions in the soul.
WE must first determine what a noun, and what a verb, are ;
next, what are negation, affirmation, enunciation, and a sentence.
Those things therefore which are in the voice, are symbols of the passions of the soul, and when written, are symbols of the (passions) in the voice, and as there are not the same letters among all men, so neither have all the same voices, yet those passions of the soul, of which these are primarily the signs, are the same among all, the things also, of which these are the similitudes, are the same.
About these latter, we have spoken in the treatise "
Of the Soul,"1 for they are parts be­ longing to another discussion, but as in the soul, there is sometimes a conception, without truth or falsehood, and at another time, it is such, as necessarily to have one of these, inherent in it, so also is it with the voice, for false­ hood and truth are involved in composition and division.
2
Nouns therefore and verbs of them-
2. Truth and falsehood of enunciation dependent on composition and division of words, as sym­ bols.
selves resemble conception, without composition and division, as " man," or " white," when some­ thing is not added, for as yet it is neither true nor false, an instance of which is that the word τραγέλαφος1 sig­ nines something indeed, but not yet any thing true or false, unless to be, or not to be, is added, either simply, or according to time.
1.
Definition of the noun­ its parts not se­ parately signi­ ficant-distinc.
tion between simple and composite.
A NOUN therefore is a sound significant 2 by compact without time, of which no part is separ­ ately significant;
thus in the noun κάλλιππος, the ἵππος signifies nothing by itself, as it does in the sentence καλὸς ἵππος ;
neither does it happen with simple nouns as it does with composite, for in the former there is by no means the part significant, but in the latter a part would be, yet signifies nothing separately, as in 2.
Ex institute, conf. c. 4. the word ἐπακτροκέλης, 3 the κέλης signifies no­ thing by itself.
But it is according to compact,4 because naturally there is no noun ;
but when it becomes a symbol, since illiterate sounds also signify some­ thing, as the sounds of beasts, of which there is no noun."
Not man, however, is not a noun, neither is a name instituted by which we ought to call it, since it is neither a sentence, nor a negation;
1 but let 3.
The indefi­ nite not a noun.
it be an indefinite noun because it exists in respect of every thing alike, both of that which is, and of that which is not.
2 Φίλων
ος indeed, or φίλωνι, and such like words are not nouns, but cases of a noun,3 but the de­ finition of it (that is, of the case) is the same as to other things (with the definition of a noun), but (it differs in) that, with ( the verb) "is" or "was" or " will be," it does not signify what is true or false, but the noun always signifies this), as 4.
Cases of the noun differ from the noun in that, being joined to the verb, or copula, they signify neither truth nor falsehood.
"
Philonus is," or " is not," for as yet, this neither signifies what is true, nor what is false.
A VERB, is that which, besides something else, sig­ nifies time ;
of which no part is separately signifi­ cant, and it is always indicative of those things which 1.
Definition of the verb or ρ̍η̄μα. are asserted of something else..
But I say that it signifies time, besides something else, as for instance, "health" is a noun, but "is well" is a verb ;
for it signifies, besides being well, that such is the case now:
it is always also significant of things asserted of something else, as of those which are predicated of a subject, or which are in a subject.
2.
A verb join­ ed with nega­ tion, or in its tenses out of the present, is not a proper logical verb.
Nevertheless
I do not call, "is not well," and, "is not ill" -verbs ;
for indeed they signify time, be­ sides something else, and are always (significant) of something, yet a name is not given to this difference, let either be therefore an indefinite verb, because it is similarly inherent both in whatever does, and does not exist.
1
So also "was well" or "will be well" are not verbs, but they are cases of a verb, and differ from a verb, because the latter, besides something else, signifies present time ;
but the others, that which is about the present time.
Verbs therefore so called, by themselves, are nouns, and have 3.
Infinitives properly nouns.
a certain signification, for the speaker establishes the conception, 2 and the hearer acquiesces, but they do not yet signify3 whether a thing " is " or " is not," for neither is " to be" or "not to be" a sign of a thing, nor if you should say merely, " being," for that is nothing ;
they signify however, besides some­ thing else, a certain composition, which with- 4. They are in­ significant ex­ cept in compo­ sition.
out the composing members it is impossible to under­ stand.
1A SENTENCE is voice significant by compact,*of which any part separately possesses signification, as indeed a word, yet not as affirmation or nega­ tion ;
now I say for example " man" is signifi­ cant, but does not imply that it " is " or " is 1. Definition of the sentence —λόγος. * κατὰ, σννθη­ κην omitted by Waltz.
not ;
"3 it will however be affirmation or negation, if any thing be added to it.
One syllable of the word ἄνθρωπος, is not however (significant),4 neither the “ υ̃ς” in ‟μυ̃ς,” but it is now merely sound;
still in compound words a part is significant, but not by itself, as we have observed.
Now every sentence is significant, not as an instrument, but, as we have said, by compact, still not every sentence is enunci­ ative,5 but that in which truth or falsehood is inherent, which things do not exist in all sentences, as prayer is a sentence, but it is neither true nor false.
Let therefore the other sentences be dismissed, their consideration belongs more properly to Rhetoric or Poetry;
but the enunciative sentence to our present theory.
2. Other kinds of sentence be­ long to Rhe­ toric-Logic conversant with the enun­ ciative alone.
ONE first enunciative sentence2 is affirmation;
afterwards negation, and all the rest are one by conjunction.
It is necessary however that every enunciative sentence should be from a verb, or from the case of a verb, for the definition of “man, unless " is," or " was," or " will be," or something of this kind, bo added, is not yet an enunciative sentence.
Why indeed is the sentence “ a terrestrial biped animal" one thing, and not many things ?
for it will not be one, because it is consecutively pro­ nounced :
this however belongs to another discussion.
3
One enunciative sentence, moreover, is either that which signifies 2. Simple or composite.
one things or which is one by conjunction,5 and many (such sentences) are either those which sig­ nify many things6 and not one thing, or which are without conjunction.
7
Let therefore a noun or a verb be only a word, since we cannot say that he enunciates who thus expresses any thing by his voice whether he is interrogated by any one or not, but that he speaks from deliberate intention.
1
Now of these enun­ ciations one is simple, for instance something of * something, or from† something, but another is composed of these,‡ as a certain sentence which is already a composite ;
simple enunciation, then, is voice significant about something being inhe­ rent, or non-inherent, according as times are di­ vided.
§
2AFFIRMATION is the enunciation of something concerning something, but negation is the enun­ ciation of something from something.
4 Since,
1. Distinctive definition of affirmation (κα­ ταφασις) and negation (ἀπό­ φασις.)
however, a man may enunciate what is inherent as though it were not,1 and what is not 2 as though it were ;
that which is, as if it were, and that which is not, as if it were not, and in like manner about times external to the pre­ sent ;
it is possible that whatever any one affirms may be denied, and that whatever any one denies may be affirmed, whence it is evident that to every affirmation there is an op­ posite negation, and to every negation an opposite affirma-
2. Opposition between affirm­ ative and nega­ tive constitutes contradiction (ἀντίϕασις).
Cf. Cat. x. 1. tion.3
Let this be contradiction, affirmation and negation being opposites,4 but I call that opposi­ tion which is of the same respecting the same,5 not equivocally, and such other particulars of the kind as we have concluded against sophistical importunities.
61. Distinction between the universal (τὰ ϰαθόλου) and the singu­ lar (τὰ καθ'ε- Κϰαστον).
OF things, since some are universal, but others singular,7 (and by universal I mean whatever may naturally be predicated of many things, but by sin­ gular, that which may not:
as " man” is universal, but "Callias" singular,) it is necessary to enunciate that something is, or is not, inherent, at one time, in an universal, at another in a singular thing.
Now, if any one universally enunciates of an universal, that something is or is not inherent, these enunciations will be contrary:
1 I mean universally enunciates of an universal, as that "every man is white," "no man is white."
When on the other hand he enunciates of univer-
2. Nature of contrariety— ἐναντίαι αὶ ἀποφάνσεις.
sals, not universally,2 these are not contraries, though the things signified may sometimes be contrary ;
but I mean by not universally enunciating of universals, as that " man is white," "man is not white for man being universal, is not employed as an universal in the enunciation, since the word " every" does not signify the universal, but (shows that the subject is) uni­ versally (taken).
Now to predicate universally of what is univer­ sally predicated is not true, for no affirmation will be true in which the universal is predicated of an universal predicate,3 as for in­ stance, " every man " is " every animal."
Where­ fore I say affirmation is opposed to negation contra­ dictorily, the affirmation which signifies the uni- 3. Of contradic­ tion ;

But contrarily is between universal affirmative and uni­ versal negative, as " every man is white," " no man is white," “ every mail is just," " no man is just."
4 Wherefore it is impossi­ of.
Contraries themselves cannot at the same time be true, though their opposites may.
ble that these should at one and the same time be true, but the opposites to these may sometimes pos­ sibly be co-verified about the same thing, as that " not every man is white," and "some man is white.”
1
Of such contradictions then of universals, as are universally made, one must necessarily be true or false, and also such as are of singulars, as " Socrates is white," " Socrates is not white;
" but of such contradictions as are indeed of universals, yet are not universally made, one is not always true, but the other false.
For at one and the same time we may truly say that " man is white," and that “ man is not white," and " man is handsome," and " man is not handsome," for if he is deformed he is not handsome, and if any thing is becoming to be, it is, not.
This how­ ever may at once appear absurd, because the assertion " man is not white," seems at the same time to signify the same thing, as “ no man is white," but it neither necessarily signi­ fies the same thing, nor at the same time.
2Notwithstanding it is evident that of one a- firmation there is one negation, for it is necessary that the negation should deny the same thing which the affirmation affirmed, and also from the to each affirm­ at ion. same, (i. e.) either from some singular or some universal, uni­ versally or not universally;
I say, for instance, that " Socrates is white," " Socrates is not white."
If however there is something else from the same thing, or the same thing from something else, that (enunciation) will not be opposite, but different from it ;
1 to the one, " every man is white," the other (is opposed) " not every man is white," and to the one, " a cer­ tain man is white," the other, “ no man is white;
" and to the one, " man is white," the other, “ man is not white.
"That there is then one affirmation contradictorily opposed to one negation, and what these are, has been shown, also that there are other contraries, and what they are, and that not every con­ tradiction is true or false, and why and when it is true or false.
1.
What con­ stitutes single affirmation and negation, is the unity of the subject, and of the predicate, without equi­ vocation.
THE affirmation and negation are one, which indi­ cate one thing of one, either of an universal, being taken universally, or in like manner if it is not, as "every man is white," " not every man is white," " man is white," "man is not white,” "no man is white," " some man is white," if that which is white signifies one thing.
But if one name be given to two things, from which one thing does not arise, there is not one affirmation nor one negation;
2 as if any one gave the name garment" to a "horse," and to "a man;
" that " the garment is white," this will not be one affirmation, nor one negation, since it in no respect differs from saying it man " and "horse" are "white," and this is equivalent to "man is white," and “ horse is white."
If therefore these signify many things, and are many, it is evident that the first enunciation either signifies many things or nothing,3 for " some man is not a horse," wherefore neither in these is it necessary that one should be a true, but the other a false contradiction.
4IN those things which are, and have been,5 the affirmation and negation must of necessity be true or false ;
in universals, as universals, always one true but the other false, and also in singulars, as we have shown;
but in the case of universals not universally enunciated, there is no such necessity, and concerning these we have also spoken, but as to singulars and futures, this is not the case.
For if every affirmation or negation be true or false, it is also necessary that every thing should exist or should not exist, for if one man says that a thing will be, but another denies the same, one of them must evidently of necessity speak truth, if every affirmation or negation be true or false, for both will not subsist in such things at one and the same time.
Thus if it is true to say that " a thing is white," or that " it is not white," it must of necessity be "white" or not "white," and if it is white or not white, it was true to affirm or to deny it :
also if it is not, it is falsely said to be, and if it is falsely said to be, it is not;
so that it is necessary that either the affirmation or the negation should be true or false.
In­ deed there is nothing which either is, or is gene­ rated fortuitously, nor casually, nor will be, or not be, but all things are from necessity, and not casually, for either he who affirms speaks truth, or he who denies, for in like manner it might either have been or not have been, for that which 2.
Whatever true affirma­ tion or nega­ tion is made of futures ex­ cludes casual existence.
subsists casually neither does nor will subsist more in this way than in that.
1
Moreover if a thing is now “ white," it was true to say before that it will be “white,” so that it was always true to say of any thing generated that it either is, or that it will be;
but if it was always true to say that it is, or will be, it is impossible that this is not, nor should be;
and whatever must of necessity be, it is impossible that it should not have been generated, and what it is impossible should not have been generated must of ne­ cessity have been generated;
wherefore all things that will be, it is necessary should be generated, and hence there will be nothing casual nor fortuitous, for if it were fortuitous it would not be of necessity.
Nor is it possible to say, that neither of them is true, as that it will neither be, nor will not be, for in the first place the affirmation being false, the nega-

tion will not be true, and this being false, it re­ sults that the affirmation is not true.
And besides, if it were true to say that a thing is at the same time " white " and it great," both must of necessity be, but if it shall be to-morrow, it must necessarily be to-morrow, and if it will neither be nor will not be to-morrow, it will not be a casual thing, for example, a naval engagement, for it would be Example.
requisite that the engagement should neither oc­ cur nor not occur.
4. What ab­ surdity follows from denying the casual.
These and similar absurdities then will hap­ pen, if of every affirmation and negation, whether in respect of universals enunciated universally, or of singulars, it is necessary that one of the op­ posites be true and the other false, but that nothing happens casually in those things which subsist, but that all are, and are generated of necessity;
so that it will neither be necessary to deliberate nor to trouble ourselves, as if we shall do this thing, something definite will occur, but if we do not, it will not occur.
For there is nothing to prevent a person for ten thousand years asserting that this will happen, and another person denying it, so that of necessity it will have been then true to assert either of them.
And it makes no difference whether any persons have uttered a contradiction or not, for it is evident that the things are so, although the one should not have affirmed any thing, or the other have denied it, since it is not, because it has been affirmed or denied, that therefore a tiling will or will not be, neither will it be more so for ten thousand years than for any time whatever.
Hence if a thing so subsisted in every time that one of these is truly asserted of it, it was necessary that this should take place;
and each thing generated, always so subsisted, as to have been generated from necessity, for when any one truly said that it will be, it was not possible not to have been generated, and of that which is generated, it was always true to say that it will be.
But * if these things are impossible—(for we see that there is a beginning of future things, both from our deliberation and practice, and briefly in things which do not always energize, * Vide Bekker, Waitz, Buhle, and the Leipsic edition.
Tay­ lor omits the εἵ.
there is equally a power of being and of not being, in which both to be and not to be occurs, as well as to have been generated and not to have been generated;
and, indeed, we have many things which evidently subsist in this manner, for example, it is possible for this garment to have been cut in pieces, and it may not be cut in pieces, but be worn out be... forehand, so also it is possible that it may not be cut in pieces, for it would not have been worn out before, unless it had been possible that it might not be cut in pieces, and so also in re­ spect of other productions, which are spoken of according to a power of this kind—) then it is evident that all things neither are, nor are generated of necessity, but that some things subsist casually, and that their affirmation is not more true than their negation, and that there are others in which one of these subsists more frequently, and for the most part, yet so, that 5.
Many things have a casual subsistence as to the nature of their affirma­ tion or nega­ tion.
either might possibly have occurred,but the other not.
Wherefore, being, must of necessity be when it is,3 and non-being, not be, when it is not;
but it is not ne­ cessary that every being should be, nor that non-being should not be, since it is not the same thing for every being to be from necessity, when it is, and simply to be from neces-

sity, and in like manner as to non-being.
There is the same reasonii g also in the case of contra­ diction ;
to be or not to be is necessary for every thing, also that it shall, or shall not be, yet it is not requisite to speak of each separately, but I Fay, for instance, that it is necessary for a naval action to occur or not occur to-morrow, yet it is not necessary that there should be a naval action to-morrow, nor that there should not be;
it is necessary, however, that it should either be or not be.
Wherefore, since assertions and things are similarly true, it is evident that things which so subsist, as that whatever have happened, the contraries also were possible, it is necessary that contradiction should subsist in the same manner, which happens to those things which are not always, or which not always, are not..
For of these, one part of the contradiction must necessarily be true or false, not indeed this or that, but just as it may happen, and one must be the rather true, yet not already true nor false;
1 so that it is evidently not necessary that of every affirmation and nega­ tion of opposites, one should be true, but the other false ;
2 for it does not happen in the same manner with things which are not, but which either may or may not be, as with things which are, but it happens as we have said 3SINCE affirmation signifies something of something, and this is either a noun, or anonymous,2 (i. e. indefinite but what is in affirmation must be one and of one thing,3 all affirmation and negation will be either from a noun and a verb, or from an indefinite noun and 1.
The parts of enunciation.
verb.
(But what a noun is, and what the anonymous, has been shown before, for I do not reckon " not man " a noun, but an indefinite noun, for an indefinite noun signifies in a certain respect one thing, just as "is not well” is not a verb, but an indefinite verb.)
Still without a verb there is neither an affirmation nor negation, for " is," or Cf. ch 2, and 3. "will be," or "was," or "is going to be," and so forth, are verbs, from what has been already laid down, since in addition to something else they signify time.
Hence the first affirmation and negation (will be), "man is," "man is not," afterwards " non-man is," " non-man is not."
Again, “ every man is," " every man is not," " every non-man is," "every non-man is not," and the same reasoning holds in times beyond (the present).
4
But when " is," is additionally predicated as the third thing, then the oppositions are enun­ ciated doubly ;
1 I say for instance, " a man is just;
" nere the word " is," I say, is placed as a third thing, whether noun or verb, in the affirmation, so that on this account, these will be 2.
If the copula be added, there will be four enunciations- their subsist­ ence exempli­ fied.
* Man or non- man, Waitz.
four, of which two will subsist with respect to affirmation and negation, according to the order of consequence, as privations, but two will not.
2
But I say that the word it is," will be added to "just" or to " not just," * so that also negation is added, where­ fore there will be four.
We shall understand, however, what is said from the under-written examples:
3 “A man is just," the negation of this is, " a man is not just ;
” “he is not a just man," the negative of this is, " he is not not a just man," for here the word "is," and "is not," will be added to the "just" and the “not just," wherefore An. Pr. 46.
3. Four others, with their pe­ culiarity, uni­ versals.
these things, as we have shown in the Analytics, are thus arranged.
The same thing will happen if the affirmation be of a noun taken universally,4 as for instance, "every man is just;
” of this the negation is, " not every man is just," “ every man is not just," "not every man is not just," except that it does not similarly happen that those which are diametrically op­ posed are co-verified;
5 sometimes, however, this does hap­ pen, these two therefore are opposed to each other.
But the other two (are opposed) in respect to “non..man,” as to a certain added subject, as 4.
Others witl an indefinite subject.
"non-man is just, "non-man is not just, "the non-just is not man," "the not non-just is not man:
" there are not, however, more oppositions than these, _but these without those, will be by themselves, as using the noun, " non-man."
In those, however, wherein, “ is," is not adapted,-as in " he enjoys health," and " he walks,”—here it produces the same when thus placed, as if "is" were added;
as " every man enjoys health," “ every man does not enjoy health," " every non-man enjoys health," "every non-man does not enjoy health."
For it must not be said, " not every man," but the negation, "not," must be added to " man;
" for "every" does not signify universal, but that (the thing is taken) universally.
1
This is hpwever evident, from " a man enjoys health," “ a man does not enjoy health," “ non-man is well," " non-man is not well," these differ from those, in not being universally (taken).
2
Hence “every,” or "no one," signifies nothing else, than that affirmation or negation is of a noun universally (assumed);
wherefore it is necessary to add other things of the same kind.
3But because the contrary negation to this, "every animal is just," is that which signifies that "no animal is just," it is evident that these will never be either true at the same time, nor in respect to the same subject, but the opposites to these will sometimes be so, as "not every animal is just," and "some animal is just.”4
But these follow;
the one, "no man is just," follows every man 5.
Consequence of the negative upon the af­ firmative, and vice versâ.
is not just," but the opposite, " some man is just,.
follows “ not every man is not just," for it is neces­ sary that some man should be just.
In the case also of singulars, it is evident that if a man being questioned denies truly, he asserts also truly, as, "Is Socrates wise?
No!"
Socrates therefore is not a wise man.
But in the case of universals, what is similarly asserted is not true, but the negation is true, as, “ Is every man wise ? No!”
Every man ἀντικειμενη­ ἐναντια.
therefore is not wise;
for this is false, but this, " not every man then is wise," is true, and this is opposite, but that is contrary.
Opposites, however, as to indefinite nouns and verbs, as "non- man" and "non-just," may seem to be negations without a noun and verb, but they are not so, for the negation must always of necessity be either true or false, but he who says “ non-man " does not speak more truly or falsely, but rather less, than he who 6.
An indefi­ nite not a le­ gitimate enun­ ciation.
says " man, except something be added.
Still the assertion, " every non-man is just," does not sig­ nify the same as any one of those (propositions), nor the opposite to this, namely, " not every non-mar.
is just;
" but the assertion, "every one not just is not a man," means the same with, “ no one is just who is not a man.
"Nouns and verbs indeed, when transposed, have the same sig­ nification, as, " he is a white man," “ he is a man white," for unless it be so, there will be many negations of the same thing, but it has been shown that there is one of one;
of this, " he is a white man," there is the negation " he is not a white man," and of the other, " he is a man white," (except this be the same with “ he is a white man,") the negation will either be “ he is not, not a man white," or “ he is not a man white."
7. No differ­ ence in affirm­ ation or nega­ tion produced
But the one is a negation of this, " he is not a man white," and the other of this, " he is a white man" (so1 that there will be two negations of one affirmation);
wherefore it is evident that when a noun and verb are transposed, the same affirmation and negation result.
by transposi­ tion.
To affirm, and deny, one thing of many, or many of one, is not one affirmation nor one negation, except that is some one thing which is manifested from the many;
I mean by one, not if one name be given to many things, nor if one thing result from them, as "man" is perhaps "animal," and 1.
One thing cannot be said of many, nor many of one, by one affirma­ tion or nega­ tion.
—Excep­ tion. " biped," and " mild," yet one thing results from these ;
but from “white” and "man," and " to walk," one thing does not re­ sult, so that neither if a person affirm one certain thing of these is it one affirmation, but there is one articulate sound indeed,1 yet many affirmations, nor if he affirmed these things of one, (would there be one affirmation,) but in like manner, many.
If, then, dialectic interrogation be the seeking of an answer, either of a proposition, or of either part of a contradiction, (but a proposition is a part of one contradiction,) there would not be one answer to these, for neither is there one interrogation, not even if it be true:
we have, however, spoken of these in the Topics, at the same time it is evident that, What is it ?
is not a dialectic interrogation,2 for a choice should be given from the interrogation to Topics, vili.
7. Soph. El. c. 6. Cf. Prior An. i. 1. προδιορίσασθαι Taylor.
enunciate this or that part of the contradiction;
but the interrogator must besides define, whether this particular thing, or not this, be a man.
As, however, there are some things predicated as composites, so that there is one whole predicable, of those which are predicated separately, but others are not so, what is the difference ?
For in respect of “ man," we may truly and separately predicate “animal” and “biped,” and these as one thing ;
also " man " and " white," and these as one thing;
but not if he is " a shoemaker" and " a good man," is he therefore 3. Disjunctions not to be as­ sumed.
as con­ junctively true.
also a good shoemaker.
For if, because each of these is true, both, conjointly, should be of neces­ sity true, many absurdities would follow, for “man” and “white” are truly predicated of a man, so that the whole together may be;
1 again, if the thing "is white," the whole conjointly "is white," wherefore, it will be " a man white, white," even to infinity;
again, " a musician white walking," and these frequently involved to infinity.
Once more, if " Socrates" is " Socrates" and " man," " Socrates" is also " Socrates man," and if he is "man" and "bipod," he is also "man biped;
" wherefore it is evident, if a man says conjunctions are simply produced,2 the result will be that he will utter many absurdities.
Let us now show how they are to be placed.
Of things predicated, and of those of which it happens to be predi­ cated, whatever are accidentally enunciated, either in respect of the same, or the one of the other, these will not be one ;
as "man is white,” and “a musician;
" but "whiteness" and “music" are not one thing, for both are accidents to the same thing.
Neither if it be true to call what is white musical, yet at the same time will "musical" "white" be one thing, for what is "white" is " musical " per accidens, so that " white musical will not be one thing, wherefore neither is a man said to be "a good shoemaker" singly, but also " a biped animal," because these are not predicated of him per accidens.
Moreover, nei- 4. Rules for simple and composite pre­ dication.
ther are such things which are inherent in another (to be added), hence, neither is " whiteness" (to be predicated) repeatedly, nor is "a man" "a man animal," nor (a man) " biped," since both animal and biped are inherent in man;
still it is true to assert it singly of some one, as that “ a cer­ tain man is a man," or that " a certain white man is a white man,” but this is not the case always.
But when some op­ position is in the adjunct which a contradiction follows, it is not true, but false, as to call a dead man a man, but when such is not inherent, it is true.
Or when something (contra­ dictory) is inherent, it is always not true;
but when it is not inherent, it is not always true, as " Homer" is something, "a poet," for instance, "is" he therefore, or " is he not? for “is” is predicated of Homer accidentally, since is" is predi­ cated of Homer because he is a poet, but not per se (or essen­ tially).
Wherefore, in whatever categories, contrariety is not inherent, if definitions are asserted instead of nouns, and are essentially predicated, and not accidentally, of these a parti­ cular thing may be truly and singly asserted ;
but non-being, because it is a matter of opinion, cannot truly be called a certain being, for the opinion of it is, not that it is, but that it is not.
THESE things then being determined, let us con­ sider how the affirmations, and negations of the possible and impossible to be, subsist with refer­ ence to each other, also of the contingent and the 1.
Of the nega­ tions του̃ δυνα­ τὸν εἶναι, ἐνδε­ χόμενoν εἶναι, and the like.
non-contingent, and of the impossible and necessary, since this has some doubtful points.
For if among the complex, those contradictions are mutually opposed, which are arranged ac­ cording to the verb “ to be," and “ not to be," (as for instance the negation “to be a man," is “not to be man," not this, " to be not a man," and the negation of " to be a white man " is " not to be a white man," and not this " to be not a white man," since if affirmation or negation be true of every thing, it will be true to say " that wood is not a white man,”)—if this be so, in those things to which the verb " to be " is not added, that which is asserted instead of the verb " to be," will pro­ duce the same thing.
For example, the negation of " a man walks," will not be " non-man walks," but, “ a man does not walk," for there is no difference in saying that " a man walks," or that " a man is walking," so that if this is every where the case, the negation of " it is possible to be," will be “ it is pos­ sible not to be," and not "it is not possible to be."
But it appears that it is possible for the same thing both to be, and not to be, for every thing which may possibly be cut, or may possibly walk, may also possibly not be cut, and not walk, and 2.
The possible­ οὐκ ἀεὶ ὲνεργει.
the reason is that every thing which is thus pos­ sible, does not always energize,1 so that negation will also belong to it, for that which is capable of walking, may not walk, and the visible may not be seen.
Still however it is impossible that opposite affirmations and negations should be true of the same thing, wherefore the ne­ gallon of " it is possible to be," is not “it is possible not to be."
Now it results from this that we either at the same time affirm and deny the same thing of the same, or that the affirmations and negations are not made according to the ad­ ditions, " to be or “ not to be ;
1" if therefore, that, be im­ possible, this, will be to be taken, wherefore the negation of " it is possible to be, is " it is not possible to be, (but* not it is possible not to be).
Now there is the same reasoning also about the being contingent, * Omitted by Bekker.
for the negation of this is, not to be contingent, and in like manner as to the rest, for example the necessary and impossible, since as in those it happens that, “ to be," and, " not to be," are additions, but " whiteness " and “ man " are subjects, so here “ to be " and " not to be," become as subjects, but " to be possi­ ble," and " to be contingent," are additions which determine the true and false in the (enunciations) "to be possible" and "to be not possible," similarly as in those, " to be," and " not to be."
2 But of " it is possible not to be," the negation is not, " it is not possible to be," but " it is not possible not to be," and of " it is possible to be," the negation is not, "it is possible not to be," but, " it is not possible to be ;
" wherefore, "it is possible to be," and, "it is possible not to be," will appear to follow each other;
for it is the same thing, “ to be possible to be," and " not to be," since such things are not contradictories of each other, namely, “ it is possible to be," and, " it is possible not to be."
But " it is pos- sible to be," and " it is not possible to be," are never true of the same thing at the same time, for they are opposed, neither at least are, " it is possible not to be," and “ it is not possible not to be," ever true at the same time of the same thing.
Like­ wise of, " it is necessary to be," the negation is not, " it is necessary not to be," but this, " it is not necessary to be," and of, "it is necessary not to be," (the negation) is this, "it is not necessary not to be."
Again, of, "it is impossible to be," the negation is not "it is impossible not to be," but "it is not impossible to be," and of, " it is impossible not to be," (the negation) is, " it is not impossible not to be."
In fact, uni­ versally, as we have said, Ito be" and "not to be," we must 2.
The εἶναι and μὴ εἶναι to be considered as subjects, with which the affirmation and negation is to be connected.
necessarily regard as subjects, but those things which produce affirmation and negation we must connect with "to be" and "not to be:
" we ought also to consider these as opposite affirmations and negations;
possible, impossible, contingent, non- contingent, impossible, not impossible, necessary;
not necessary, true, not true.
THE consequences are rightly placed thus:
" it happens to be," follows, " it is possible to be," and this reciprocates with that;
also, " it is not impos­ sible to be" and "it is not necessary to be."
But, “ it is not necessary not to be," and, ,it is not impossible not to be;
" follow, "it is possible not to be," and, "it may happen not to be ;
" and, " it is necessary not to be," and, " it is im­ possible to be," follow, "it is not possible to be," and, "it does not happen to be ;
" but, " it is necessary to be," and also, “ it is impossible not to be," follow, " it is not possible not to be," and, "it is not contingent not to be :

4

Therefore the impossible, and the not impossi­ ble, follow contradictorily the contingent, and the possible, and the non-contingent, and the not possible, and vice versâ ;

impossible, namely, "it is not impossible to be," follows, "it is possible to be," but affirmation follows negation, for, " it is im­ possible to be " follows “ it is not possible to be," since " it is impossible to be," is affirmation, but, “ it is not impossible to be," is negation.
Let us next see how it is with necessary matter, now it is evident that it does not subsist thus, but contraries follow, and contradictories (are placed) separately,1 for, “ it is not ne­ cessary to be," is not the negation of “ it is ne­ cessary not to be," since both, may possibly be true of the same thing, as that which necessarily, is not, need not of necessity, be.
But the reason why the 2.
TO ἀναγκαι̃ον its peculiarity, with the reason and proof.
necessary follows not, in like manner, other propositions, is that the impossible being enunciated contrarily to the ne­ cessary, signifies the same thing ;
for what it is impossible should exist, must not of necessity be, but not be, and what is impossible should not be, this must of necessity be;
so that if these similarly follow the possible and the not possible, these (do so) in a contrary mode,2 since the necessary and the impossible do not signify the same tiling, but, as we have said, Buhle and Averrois omit the question.
vice versa.
Or is it impossible that the contra­ dictories of the necessary should be thus disposed ?
for, what, "is necessary to be" is "possible to be, since if not, negation would follow, as it is necessary either to affirm or deny, so that, if it is not possible to be, it is im­ possible to be, wherefore it would be impossible for that to be, which necessarily is, which is absurd, but the enunciation, "it is not impossible to be" follows the other, "it is possible to be," which again is followed by, " it is not necessary to be," whence it happens that what necessarily exists does not necessarily exist, which is absurd.
But again neither does, "it is necessary to be" follow “it is possible to be," nor does the proposition, " it is necessary not to be," for to that, both, may occur, but whichever of these is true,1 those2 will be no longer true, for at one and the same time, it is possible to be, and not to be, but if it is necessary either to be or not to be, both, will not be possible.
It remains therefore, that " it is not necessary not to be," follows " it is possible to be ;
" for this3 is also true in respect of what is necessary to be, since this becomes the contradiction of that proposition which follows, viz.
"it is not possible to be;
" as “it is impossible to be," and " it is necessary not to be," follow that, of which the negation is, " it is not necessary not to be."
Wherefore these contradictions follow according to the above-mentioned mode, and nothing absurd results, when they are thus disposed.
42. Solution of a difficulty as to the above, by the distinction between ration­ al and irration­ al potentiality.
Still it may be doubted whether " it is possible to be," follows “ it is necessary to be," for if it does not follow, the contradiction will be conse­ quent, namely, " it is not possible to be," and if a man should deny this to be a contradiction, it will be necessary to call, " it is possible not to be," a contradiction, both which are false in respect of necessary matter.
Nay, on the contrary, it appears to be possible that the same thing should " be cut" and " not be cut," should " be" and "not be," so that what necessarily "is," may happen "not to be," which is false.
Nevertheless it is evident that not every thing which can " be," and can " walk," is capable also of the op­ posites, for in some cases this is not true.
In the first place, in those things which are potent irrationally,1 as fire is calorific, and has irrational power;
rational powers then are those of many things, and of a!
νετὰ δυνάμαις.
the contraries ;
but not all irrational powers, for, as we have said, fire cannot heat, and not heat, nor such other things as always energize.
Yet even some irrational powers can at the same time receive opposites;
but this has been stated by us, because not every power is susceptible of con­ traries, not even such as are predicated, according to the same species.
Moreover, some powers are equivocal, for the possible is not predicated, simply;
but one thing is (called so), because it is true, as being in an energy, as it is possible for a man to walk, because he walks, and in short, a thing is pos­ sible to be, because that is already in energy which is said to be possible;
on the other hand, another thing (is said to be possible), because it may be in energy;
as it is possible to walk, because a man may walk.
Now this power exists in movable natures only, but that in immovable;
but with re­ spect to both, it is true to say, that it is not impossible to walk or to be, and that a man is now walking and energizing, and has the power to walk, hence it is not true2 to predicate that which is thus possible, in respect of necessary matter, simply, but the other is true.
Wherefore since the universal follows the particular, to be able to be, but not all ability, fol­ lows that which is of necessity, and indeed the necessary and the non-necessary may perhaps be 3.
The ἀναγκαῑ-
Of καὶ μὴ ἁν, are the ἀρχὴ, πάντων εἶναι ἢ μὴ εἶναὶ ?
the principle of the existence, or of the non-exist­ ence of all things, and we should consider other things as consequent upon these.
1
Hence from what we have stated, it is clear that whatever exists of necessity, is in energy, so that if eternal natures are prior in existence, 4. The TO if, ἀνάγκης ὂν, κατ’ ἀνερειάν ἐστιν.
Priority.
energy also is prior to power, and some things, as the first substances, are energies without power, but others with power, namely, those which are prior by nature, but posterior in time :
lastly, there are some which are never energies, but are capacities only.
1.
Those opin­ ions are con-BUT whether is affirmation contrary to negation, or affirmation to affirmation ?
and is the sentence which says, every man is just," contrary to the one, “ no man is just," or the sentence every man is just," to, "every man is unjust," as “Cal­ lias is just," "Callias is not just," " Callias is un­ just," —which of these are contraries?
For if things in the voice, follow those which exist in trary which are of contrary matter, and the propositional contrariety cor­ responds with the contrariety of opinion.
the intellect, but there the opinion of a contrary is contrary, as for instance, that "every man is just," is contrary to, “ every man is unjust," it is necessary that affirmations also in the voice should subsist in the same manner, but if there, the opinion of a contrary be not contrary, neither will affirm­ ation be contrary to affirmation, but the before-named ne­ gation.
Hence it must be considered what false opinion is contrary to the true opinion, whether that of negation or that which opines it to be the contrary.
I mean in this way, there is a certain true opinion of good that it is good, but an­ other false opinion that it is not good, lastly, a third, that it is evil, which of these therefore is contrary to the true opinion ?
and if there is one, according to which is it contrary ?
If then a man should fancy contrary opinions to be defined by this, that they are of contraries, it would be erroneous, for of good that it is good, and of evil that it is evil, there is perhaps the same opinion, and it is true whether there be many (opinions) or one :
but these are contraries, yet not from their being of contraries are they contraries, but rather from their subsist­ ing in a contrary manner.
2
If then there is an opinion of good that it is good, but another that it is not good, and there is also something else, which is neither inherent, nor can be, in good, we cannot admit any contrary of the rest, neither such opinions as imagine the non-inherent to be inherent, nor the inherent to be non-inherent, (for both are infinite,1 both as many as imagine the non-inherent to be inherent, and the inherent to be non-inherent) ;
but in those things in which there is deception, (therein we admit contraries,) and these are from which there are generations;
generations however are from opposites, wherefore deceptions also.
If then good is good and not evil, and the one is essential, but the other accidental —(for it is accidental to it not to be evil) and of every thing the opinion is more true and false which is essential, if the true (be assumed)—the opinion that good is not good, is false in respect of that which is essentially inherent, but the opinion that it is evil is false of that which is from acci­ dent, so that the opinion of the negation of good would be more false than the opinion of the contrary.
He is however especially deceived about every thing who holds a contrary opinion, for contraries belong to things which are the most diverse about the same thing.
If then one of these is con­ trary, but the opinion of the negation is more contrary, it is evident that this itself will be (truly) contrary;
but the opinion that the good is evil is complex, for it is necessary perhaps, that the same man should suppose (good) not good.
Once more, if it is requisite for the like to occur in other things, it may seem to have been well said in this case also;
for the (opposition) of negation is either every where or no where;
but whatever things have no contraries, of these, the opposite to the true opinion is false, as he is mistaken who fancies “ a man " " not a man," if then these (negations) are contrary the other (opinions) also, of negation, are.
Besides, it is the same as to the opinion of good that it is good, and of what is not good, that it is not good;
and also the opinion of good, that it is not good, and of what is not good that it is good;
to the opinion then of the not good that it is not good, which is true, 2. Nature of contrariety be­ tween affirma­ tion and nega­ tion.
what will be the contrary?
Certainly not that which says that it is evil, since it may at one and the same time be true;
but truth is never contrary to truth, for whatever is not good is evil, so that it will happen that these opinions, shall be at one and the same time, true.
Nor again will that (opinion) that it is not evil, be ( the contrary), for that is also true, and these may exist at the same time, wherefore (the opinion) of what is not good, that it is good, remains as a contrary to the opinion of what is not good, that it is not good, and this will be false, so that the opinion of good that it is not good, will be the contrary to that of what is good, that it is good.
That there will be no difference though we should propose universal affirmation is evident, for universal negation will be the contrary;
as for in­ stance, to the opinion which supposes every thing good to be good, that nothing of good things is good (will be the contrary opinion), for the opinion of good that it is good, if good be universal, is the same with that which opines that whatever is good is good, and this differs in no respect from the opinion that every thing which is good is good, and the like takes place as to that which is not good.
So that if this be the case in opinion, and affirmations and negations in the voice are sym­ bols of (conceptions) in the soul, it is clear that the universal negation which is about the same thing, is contrary to affirm­ ation.
For instance, to " every thing good is good," or that every man is good," (the negation is contrary,) that “ nothing or no man is good;
" but this, that " not every thing, or not every man," (is good, is opposed) contradictorily.
It is however evident, that true opinion can neither possibly be contrary to true opinion, nor true negation (to true negation), for those are contraries which subsist about op­ posites;
but about the same things the same may be verified, but contraries cannot possibly be in-

herent in the same thing, at one and the same time.
11. Purport of this treatise­ the attainment of demonstra­ tive science.
IT is first requisite to say what is the subject, concerning which, and why, the present treatise is undertaken, namely, that it is concerning de­ monstration, and for the sake of demonstrative science;
we must afterwards define, what is a proposition, what a term, and what a syllogism, also what kind of syllo­ gism is perfect, and what imperfect;
lastly, what it is for a thing to be, or not to be, in a certain whole, and what we say it is to be predicated of every thing, or of nothing (of a class).
A proposition then is a sentence which affirms or denies something of something,2 and this is uni­ versal, or particular, or indefinite ;
I denominate universal, the being present3 with all or none;
particular, the being present with something, or not with something, or not with every thing ;
but the indefinite the being present or not being present, without the universal or particular (sign);
as for example, that there is the same science of contraries, or that pleasure is not good.
But a demonstrative proposition differs from a dialectic in this, that the demonstrative is an assumption of one part of the contradiction, for a demonstrator does not in­ terrogate, but assume, but the dialectic is an in-

1
As regards however forming a syllogism from either proposition, there will be no difference between one and the other, since he who demonstrates and he who interrogates syllogize, assuming that something is or is not present with something.
Wherefore a syllogistic proposition will be simply an affirma­ tion or negation of something concerning some-

of contradiction, but to him who syllogizes, an assumption of what is seen and probable, as we have shown in the Topics.
What therefore a proposition is, and wherein the syllogistic demonstrative and dialectic differ, will be shown accurately in the following treatises, but for our present requirements 6. Definition of a term—ὅρος. what has now been determined by us may per­ haps suffice.
Again, I call that a " term," into which a proposition is resolved, as for instance, the predicate and that of which it is predicated, whether to be 7.
And of a syllogism.
or not to be is added or separated.
Lastly, a syllogism is a sentence in which certain things being laid down, something else different from the premises necessarily results, in consequence of their ex­ istence.
1
I say that, “in consequence of their existence," something results through them, but though something happens through them, there is no need of any external term in order 1.
The latter either perfect, τέλειος. or, 2. ἀτελης. to the existence of the necessary (consequence).
Wherefore I call a perfect syllogism that which requires nothing else, beyond (the premises) as­ sumed, for the necessary (consequence) to appear:
but an imperfect syllogism, that which requires besides, one or more things, which are necessary, through the supposed terms, but have not been assumed through propositions.
2
But for one thing to be in the whole of another, and for one thing to be predicated of the whole of another, are the same thing, 8. Definition of predication de omni et nullo.
and we say it is predicated of the whole, when no­ thing can be assumed of the subject, of which the other may not be asserted, and as regards being predicated of nothing, in like manner.
3SINCE every proposition is either of that which is present (simply), or is present necessarily or contingently, and of these some are affirmative, but others negative, according to each appellation;
again, since of affirmative and negative propositions 1.
Doctrine of conversion, with example of conversion in E, univer­ sally.
some are universal, others particular, and others indefinite, it is necessary that the universal negative proposition of what is present should be converted in its terms;
for instance, if " no pleasure is good," " neither will any good be pleasure."
But an affirmative proposition we must of neces­ sity convert not universally, but particularly,1 as if “ all pleasure is good," it is also necessary that 2.
A and I to be converted particularly.
" a certain good should be pleasure;
" but of particular pro­ positions, we must convert the affirmative proposition parti­ cularly, since if " a certain pleasure is good," so also " will a certain good be pleasure;
” a negative proposition however need not be thus converted, since it does not follow, if " man " is not present with " a certain animal," that animal also is not present with a certain man.
3. Conversion of 0 unneces­ sary.
Let then first the proposition A B be an universal nega­ tive ;
if A is present with no B, neither will B be present with any A, for if it should be present with some A, for ex­ ample with C, it will not be true, that A is present with no B, since C is something of B.
If, again, A is pre­ sent with every B, B will be also present with 4.
Examples.
some A, for if with no A, neither will A be present with any B, but it was supposed to be present with every B.
In a similar manner also if the proposition be particular, for if A be present with some B, B must also necessarily be present with some A, for if it were present with none, neither would A be present with any B, but if A is not present with some B, B need not be present with some A, for example, if B is “animal," but A, " man," for man is not present with “every animal," but " animal is present with " every man.
"1. Rule for modal conver­ lion the same as for pure pro­ posit ions.
Ex­ ample of the necessary mo­ dal.
THE same system will hold good in necessary pro­ positions, for an universal negative is universally convertible, but either affirmative proposition par­ ticularly ;
for if it is necessary that A should be present with no B, it is also necessary that B should be present with no A, for if it should hap­ pen to be present with any, A also might happen to be pre­ sent with some B.
But if A is of necessity present with every or with some certain B, B is also necessarily present with some certain A;
for if it were not necessarily, neither would A of necessity be present with some certain B:
a particular negative however is not converted, for the reason we have before assigned.
In contingent propositions, (since contingency is mul­ tifariously predicated, for we call the necessary, and the not necessary, and the possible, contingent,) in all affirmatives, conversion will occur in a similar manner, for if A is con­ tingent to every or to some certain B, B may also be con­ tingent to some A;
for if it were to none, neither would (Vide ch. 2.) A be to any B, for this has been shown before.
The like however does not occur in negative propositions, but such things as are called contingent either from their being necessarily not present, or from their being not necessarily present, (are converted) similarly (with the former) ;
e. g. if a man should say, that it is contingent, for " a man,” not to be " a horse," or for “whiteness " to be present with no " gar-
2. Of the con­ tingent, with example.
ment.
For of these, the one, is necessarily not present, but the other, is not necessarily, present;
and the proposition is similarly convertible, for if it be contingent to no " man " to be " a horse," it also concurs with no " horse " to be " a man," and if " whiteness " happens to no “garment," a " garment " also happens to no “whiteness;
" for if it did happen to any, "whiteness" will also necessarily happen to "a certain gar­ ment, and this has been shown before, and in like manner with respect to the particular negative proposition.
But whatever things are called con­ tingent as being for the most part and from their nature, (after which manner we define the contin­ gent, will not subsist similarly in negative conver- (Ch. 2.) 3. Of things called contin­ gent, with the differences in conversion be­ tween E and O. sions, for an universal negative proposition is not converted, but a particular one is, this however will be evident when we speak of the contingent.
At present, in addition to what we have said, let thus much be manifest, that to happen to nothing, or not to be present with any thing, has an affirma­ tive figure,* for “it is contingent," is similarly ar­ ranged with "it is," and "it is" always and entirely * Cf. ch. 12, de Interpreta­ tione.
produces affirmation in whatever it is attributed to, e. g. " it is not good," or, " it is not white," or in short, " it is not this thing."
This will however be shown in what follows, but as regards conversions, these will coincide with the rest.
THESE things being determined, let us now de­ scribe by what, when, and how, every syllogism is produced, and let us afterwards speak of demon­ stration, for we must speak of syllogism prior to demonstration, because syllogism is more uni­ versal, since, indeed, demonstration is a certain 1.
Syllogism being more universal than demonstration is first discuss­ ed—its nature and construe.
tion.
syllogism, but not every syllogism is demonstration.
When, then, three terms so subsist, with reference to each other, as that the last is in the whole of the middle, and the mid­ dle either is, or is not, in the whole of the first, then it is neces­ sary that there should be a perfect syllogism of the extremes.
Definition of ιμέσος, and of ατρα.—example of syllogism.
But I call that the middle,1 which is itself in an­ other, whilst another is in it,2 and which also be­ comes the middle by position,3 but the extreme4 that which is itself in another, and in which an­ other also is.
5
For if A is predicated of every B, and B of every C, A must necessarily be predicated of every C, for it has been before shown, how we predicate " of every;
" so also if A is predicated of no B, but B is predicated of every C, A will not be predicated of any C.
But if the first is in every middle, but the middle is in no last, there is not a syllogism of the extremes, for nothing necessarily results from the ex­ istence of these, since the first happens to be present with every, and with no extreme;
so that neither a particular nor universal (conclusion) necessarily results, and nothing neces­ sary resulting, there will not be through these a syllogism.
Let the terms of being present universally, be "animal," "man," " horse," and let the terms of being present with no one be "animal," "man," "stone."*
Since, then, neither the first term is present with the middle, nor the * Example (I.) middle with any extreme, there will not thus be a syllogism.
Let the terms of being present, be " science,” “line" " medi­ cine," but of not being present, " science," It line," " unity;
the terms then being universal, it is t Example (2.) manifest in this figure, when there will and when there will not be a syllogism, also that when there is a syllogism, it is necessary that the terms should subsist, as we have said, and that if they do thus subsist there will evidently be a syllogism
But if one of the terms be universal and the other particu lar, in relation to the other, when the universal is joined to the major extreme, whether affirmative or negative, but the par­ ticular to the minor affirmative, there must necessarily be a perfect syllogism, but when the (universal) is joined to the minor, or the terms are arranged in some other way, a (syl­ logism) is impossible.
I call the major extreme that in which the middle is, and the minor that which is under the middle.
For let A be present with every B, but B with some C, if then to be 3.
Definition of τὸ μεĩζον, and TO ἔλαττον ὰκρον.
predicated " of every " is what has been asserted from the first, A must necessarily be present with some C, and if A is pre­ sent with no B, but B with some C, A must necessarily not be present with some C, for what we mean by the being predi­ cated of no one has been defined, so that there will be a perfect syllogism.
In like manner, if B, C, being affirm­ ative, be indefinite, for there will be the same syl­ logism, both of the indefinite, and of that which is assumed as a particular.
4. Syllogistic ratio the same for indefinite as for the par­ ticular.
If indeed to the minor extreme an universal af­ firmative or negative be added, there will not be a syllogism, whether the indefinite, or particular, affirms or denies, e. g. if A is or is not present 5.
No syllogism if the minor be universal, but the major par ticular, or in­ definite.
with some B, but B is present to every C;
let the terms of affirmation be "good," "habit," "prudence," and those * Example (3.) of negation, "good," "habit, "ignorance.
Again, if B is present with no C, but A is present or is not present with some B, or not with every B ;
neither thus will there be a syllogism ;
let the terms of t Example (4.) being present with every (individual) be “white," † "horse," "swan;
" but those of being present with no one, be " white," “horse," “crow."
The same also 6.
Nor when the major is A or E, but the minor O. may be taken if A, B be indefinite.
Neither will there be a syllogism, when to the major extreme the universal affirmative or negative is added;
but to the minor, a particular negative, whether it be indefinitely or particularly taken, e. g. if A is present with every B;
but B is not present with some, or not with every C, for to what the middle is not present, to this, both to every, and to none, the first will be consequent.
For let the terms, it animal," “man," " white," be supposed, afterwards from among those white things, of which man is not predicated, let "swan" and "snow" be taken;
hence "animal" is predi­ cated of every individual of the one, but of no individual of the t Example (5.) other, wherefore there will not be a syllogism.‡
Again, let A be present with no B, but B not be present with some C, let the terms also be "inanimate," “man," " white," then let " swan" and “snow" be taken from those white things, of which man is not predicated, for inani­ mate is predicated of every individual of the one, but of no I Example (6.) individual of the other.
§ Once more, since it is indefinite for B not to be present with some C, (for it is truly asserted, that it is not present with some C, whether it is present with none, or not with every C,) such terms being taken, so as to be present with none, there will be no syllogism (and this has been declared before).
Where­ fore it is evident, that when the terms are thus, there will not be a syllogism, since if one could be, there could be also one in these, and in like manner it may be shown, if even an uni- 7. Nor when both are parti­ cular, etc. versal negative be taken.
Nor will there by any means be a syllogism, if both particular inter­ vals I be predicated either as affirmative or nega- five, or the one affirmative and the other negative, or the one indefinite, or the other definite, or both indefinite;
but let the common terms of all be "animal," "white," "man," "animal," "white," "stone."* * Example (7.)
From what has been said, then, it is evident, that if there be a particular syllogism in this figure, the terms must ne­ cessarily be as we have said, and that if the terms be thus, there will necessarily be a syllogism, but by no means if they are otherwise.
It is also clear, that all the syllogisms in this figure are perfect, for all are perfected through the first assumptions;
and that all problems are demonstrated by this figure, for by this, to be present with all, and with none, 8. Σχη̃μα πρω̃­ τον.
The first figure com­ plete, and com­ prehends all classes of af­ firmation and negation.
and with some, and not with some, (are proved,) and such I call the first figure.
2WHEN the same (middle term) is present with every individual, (of the one,) but with none, (of the other,) or is present to every or to none of each, 1, Σχη̃μα, B., its denomina­ tion, with the position of the terms-no per - feet syllogism in this figure­ its connexion with both uni­ versal and par­ ticular quan­ tity.
a figure of this kind I call the second figure.
The middle term1 also in it, I call that which is predicated of both extremes, and the ex­ tremes I denominate those of which this mid­ dle is predicated, the greater extreme being that which is placed near the middle, but the less, that which is farther from the middle.
Now the mid­ dle is placed beyond the extremes, and is first in posi­ tion ;
wherefore by no means will there be a perfect syllo­ * i. e. a syllo­ gismo gism in this figure.
There may however be one,.
both when the terms are, and are not, universal,2 and if they be universal there will be a syllogism when the middle is present with all and with none, to which ever extreme the negation is added,3 but by no means in any other way.
For let M be predicated of no N, but of every 0;
since then a negative proposition is convertible, N will be present with no M;
but M was supposed to be pre­ sent with every 0, wherefore N will be present with no 0, for this has been proved before.
Again, if M be present with every N, but with no 0, neither will 0 be present with any N, for if M be present with no 0, neither will 0 be present with any M;
but M was present with every N, hence also 0 will be present with no N ;
for again the first figure is produced ;
since however a negative proposition is converted, neither will N be present with any 0;
hence there will be the same syllo­ gism.
We may also demonstrate the same things, by a de­ duction to the impossible;
it is evident therefore, that when the terms are thus, a syllogism, though not a perfect one, is produced, for the necessary is not only perfected from first as-
2. From uni­ versal affirm­ sumptions, but from other things also.
4
If also M is predicated of every N and of every 0, there will not be a syllogism, let the terms of being present be "substance," "animal," "man," and of not being present" substance," “animal," “stone," the middle term "substance."*
Nor will there atives there is no conse­ quence.
* Example (1.) then be a syllogism, when M is neither predicated of any N, nor of any 0, let the terms of being present be “line,” " ani­ mal," “man;
” but of not being present, “line,” " animal," " stone."t t Example (2.)Hence it is evident, that if there is a syllogism when the terms are universal, the latter must necessarily be, as we said at the beginning,1 for if they are otherwise, no necessary (con­ clusion) follows.
But if the middle be universal in respect to either extreme, when universal belongs to the major either affirmatively or negatively, but to the minor particularly, and in a manner opposite to the universal, (I mean by opposition, if the universal be negative, but the particular affirmative, or if the universal is affirmative, but the particular negative,) it is necessary that a particular negative syllogism should result.
For if M is present with no N, but with a certain 0, N must necessarily not be pre­ sent with a certain 0, for since a negative propo- 3. When the major is A or E, and the minor I or 0, the con­ clusion is O. sition is convertible, N will be present with no M, but M was by hypothesis present with a certain 0, wherefore N will not be present with a certain 0, for a syllogism is produced in the first figure.
Again, if M is present with every N, but not with a certain 0, N must of necessity not be present with a certain 0, for if it is present with every 0, and M is predicated of every N, M must necessarily be present with every 0, but it was sup­ posed not to be present with a certain 0, and if M is present with every N, and not with every 0, there will be a syllogism, that N is not present with every 0, and the demonstration will be the same.
But if M is predicated of every 0, but not of every N, there will not be a syllogism;
let the terms of presence be " animal,” " substance," " crow," and of absence * Example (3.) " animal, "white, “crow;
* neither will there be a syllogism when M is predicated of no 0, but of a certain N, let the terms of presence be "animal," "substance," t Example (4.) " stone," but of absence, " animal," " substance," " science."
tWhen therefore universal is opposed to particular, we have declared when there will, and when there will not, be a syllogism ;
ὁμοιοσχήμονες.
4. If both pre­ mises be of the same quality, no syllogism results.
but when the propositions are of the same quality,1 as both being negative or affirmative, there will not by any means be a syllogism.
For first, let them be negative, and let the universal belong to the major extreme, as let M be present with no N, and not be present with a certain 0, it may happen therefore that N shall be present with every and with no O;
let the terms of 4 Example (5.) universal absence be " black, " snow, ” “ani­ mal ;
” t but we cannot take the terms of universal presence, if M is present with a certain 0, and with a certain 0 not present.
For if N is present with every 0, but M with no N, M will be present with no 0, but by hypothesis, it was present with some 0, wherefore it is not possible thus to assume the terms.
We may prove it nevertheless from the indefinite,2 for since M was truly asserted not to be with some certain 0, even if it is present with no 0;
yet being present with no 0, there was not a syllogism, it is evident, that neither now will there be one.
Again, let them.
be affirmative, and let the universal be similarly assumed, e. g. let M be present with every N, and with a certain * i. e. both pro­ positions.
0, N may happen therefore to be present, both with every and with no 0, let the terms of being present with none, be "white, "swan," "snow;
”† but we cannot as­ sume the terms of being present with every, for t Example (6.) the reason which we have before stated, but it may be shown from the indefinite.‡
But if the universal be joined to the minor extreme, and M is present with ‡ Example (7.) no 0, and is not present with some certain N, it is possible for N to be present with every and with no 0;
let the terms of presence be "white," "animal," "crow," but of absence, " white,” " stone,” " crow."
§ But if the proposi­ tions are affirmative, let the terms of absence be § Example (8.) “white,” " animal," " snow," of presence, " white," " animal," "swan. || Therefore it is evident, when the pro­ positions are of the same quality, and the one || Example (9.) universal, but the other particular, that there is by no means a syllogism.
Neither, however, will there be one, if a thing be present to some one of each term, or not present, or to the one, but not to the other, or to neither universally, or indefinitely, let the common terms of all be "white, "ani­ mal," “man ;
" “white,” " animal," " inanimate.”¶ ¶ Example (10.)Wherefore it is evident, from what we have stated, that if the terms subsist towards each other, as has been said, there is necessarily a syllogism, and if there be a syllogism, the terms must thus subsist.
It is also clear that all syllogisms in this figure are imperfect, for all of them are produced from certain assumptions, which are either of necessity in the terms, or are admitted as hypotheses, as when we demonstrate by the 5.

Lastly, it appears that an affirmative syllogism is not produced in this figure, but all are negative, both the universal and also the particular.

Σχη̃μα r. the third fi­ gure, its cha­ racteristic—the middle is the subject of both premises-no perfect syllo­ gism in this figure.
WHEN with the same thing one is present with every, but the other with no individual, or both with every, or with none, such I call the third figure ;
and the middle in it, I call that of which we predicate both, but the predicates the ex­ tremes, the greater extreme being the one more remote from the middle, and the less, that which is nearer to the middle.
But the middle is placed beyond the extremes, and is last in position ;
now neither will there be a * i. e. a syllo­ gism.
perfect syllogism, even in this figure, but there may be one,* when the terms are joined to the middle, both universally, and not universally.
Now when the terms are universally so, when, for instance, P and R are present with every S, there will be a syllogism, so that P will necessarily be present with some certain R, for since an affirmative is convertible, S will be present to a cer­ tain R.
Wherefore since P is present to every S, but S to some certain R, P must necessarily be present with some R, for a syllogism arises in the first figure.
We may also make διὰ του̃ ἐκθέσ­ θαι. the demonstration through the impossible, and by exposition.
2
For if both are present with every S, if some S is assumed, (e. g.) N, both P and R will be present with this, wherefore P will be present with a certain R, and if R is present with every S, but P is present with no S, there will be a syllogism, so that P will be neces­ sarily inferred as not present with a certain R;
for the same mode of demonstration will take place, the proposition R S being converted;
this may also be demonstrated by the im­ possible, as in the former syllogisms.
But if R is present with no S, but P with every S, there will not be a syllogism;
let the terms of presence be "animal," "horse," "man," but of absence "animal," "inanimate," “man.”*
Neither when both are predicated of no S, will * Example (1.) there be a syllogism, let the terms of presence be " animal,” “horse,” " inanimate," but of absence " man," It horse,” inanimate," the middle " inanimate." t t Example (2.)
Wherefore also in this figure it is evident, when there will, and when there will not, be a syllogism, the terms being universal, for when both terms are affirmative, there will be a syllogism, in which it will be concluded that extreme is with a cer­ tain extreme,1 but when both terms are negative there will not be.
When however one is negative and the other affirmative, and the major is nega­ tive but the other affirmative, there will be a syl­ logism, that the extreme is not present with 2.
When both premises are affirmative there will be a syllogism, but not when both are negative­ the major moreover may be negative,and the minor, at­ firmative.
a certain extreme, but if the contrary there will not be.
If indeed one be universal in respect to the middle,2 and the other particular, both being affirmative, syllogism is necessarily produced, whichever term be universal.
For if R is present with every S, but P with a certain S, P must necessarily be present with a certain R, for since the affirmative is convert­ ible, S will be present with a certain P, so that since R is present to every S, and S with a certain P, R will also be present with a certain P, wherefore also P will be present with a certain R. Again, if R is present with a certain S, but P is present with every S, P must necessarily be present with a certain R, for the mode of demonstration is the same, and these things may be demonstrated like the former, both by the impossible, and by exposition.
If however one be affirm­ ative, and the other negative, and the affirmative be universal, when the minor is affirmative there will be a syllogism ;
for if R is present with every S, and P not present with a certain S, P must also necessarily not be present with a certain R, since if P is present with every R, and R with every S, P will also be present with every S, but it is not present, and this may also be shown without deduction, if some S be taken with which P is not present.
But when the major is affirm­ ative there will not be a syllogism, e. g. if P is present with every S, but R is not present with a certain S;
let the terms * Example (3.) of being universally present with be " animate," "man," "animal."*
But it is not possible to take the terms of universal negative, if R is present with a certain S, and with a certain S is not present, since if P is present with every S, and R with a certain S, P will also be present with a certain R, but it was supposed to be present with no R, therefore we must assume the same as in the former syllogisms.
As to declare something not present with a cer­ tain thing is indefinite, so that also which is not present with any individual, it is true to say, is not present with a certain individual, but not being present with any, there was no syl­ logism, (therefore it is evident there will be no syllogism).
1
But if the negative term be universal, (yet the particular af­ firmative,) when the major is negative, but the minor affirm­ ative, there will be a syllogism, for if P is present with no S, but R is present with a certain S, P will not be present with a certain R, and again there will be the first figure, the pro­ position R S being converted.
But when the minor is nega­ tive, there will not be a syllogism ;
let the terms of presence be “animal," " man," " wild" but of absence, “animal" “science," " wild," the middle of both, “wild." *
Nor will there be a syllogism when both are ne­ * Example (4.) gative, the one universal, the other particular:
let the terms of absence when the minor is universal as to the middle, be “animal,” " science," " wild,” (of presence, " ani­ mal," "man," “wild).”†
When however the t Example (5.) major is universal, but the minor particular, let the terms of absence be "crow," "snow," “white;
”† but of presence we cannot take the terms, if R is present ‡ Example (6.) with some S, and with some is not present, since if P is present with every R, but R with some S, P will also be present with some S, but it was supposed to be present with no S, indeed it may be proved from the indefinite.
Neither if each ex­ treme be present or not present with a certain middle, will there be a syllogism;
or if one be present and the other not;
or if one be with some individual and the other with not every or indefinitely.
But let the common terms of all be, "animal," "man," " white" "animal," "inanimate," "white."
§ Wherefore it is clear in this figure also, when there will § Example (7.) and when there will not be a syllogism, and that when the terms are disposed as we have stated, a syllogism of necessity subsists, and that there should be a syllogism, it is necessary that the terms should be thus.
It is also clear that all syllogisms in this figure are imperfect, for 3.
No universal conclusion do- rived from this figure.
they are all perfected by certain assumptions, and that an universal conclusion either negative or af­ firmative, cannot be drawn from this figure.
1IN all the figures it appears that when a syllogism is not pro­ duced, both terms being affirmative, or negative, (and par­ ticular,2) nothing, in short, results of a necessary character;
1. If one pre­ mise be A or I, and the other E, there will be a conclusion in which the mi­ nor is predi­ cated of the major.
but if the one be affirmative and the other nega­ tive, the negative being universally taken, there is always a syllogism of the minor extreme with the major.
For example, if A is present with every or with some B, but B is present with no C, the propositions being converted, C must necessarily not be present with some A;
so also in the other figures, for a syllogism is always produced by conversion :
again, it is clear that an indefinite taken for a particular affirm­ ative, will produce the same syllogism in all the figures.
Moreover it is evident that all incomplete syllogisms are completed by means of the first figure, for all of them are concluded, either ostensively or per impossibile, but in both ways the first figure is produced:
being osten­ * δεικτικω̃ς.
sively*3 completed, (the first figure is produced,) because all of them were concluded by conversion, but conversion produces the first figure :
but if they are de- monstrated per impossible, (there will be still the first figure,) because the false being assumed, a syllogism arises in the first figure.
For example, in the last figure, if A and B are present with every C, it can be shown that A is present with some B, for if A is present with no B, but B is present with every C, A will be present with no C;
but it was supposed that A was present with every C, and in like manner it will happen in other in­ stances.
It is also possible to reduce all syllogisms to universal syllogisms in the first figure.
For those in the second, it is evident, are completed through these, yet not all in like manner, but the universal by conversion of the negative, and each of the particular, by deduction per impos-

sibile.
Now, particular syllogisms in the first figure are com­ pleted through themselves, but may in the second figure be demonstrated by deduction to the impossible.
For example, if A is present with every B, but B with a certain C, it can be shown that A will be present with a certain C, for if A is present with no C, but is present with every B, B will be present with no C, for we know this by the second figure.
So also will the demonstration be in the case of a negative, for if A is present with no B, but B is present with a certain C, A will not be present with a certain C, since if A is present with every C, and with no B, B will be present with no C, and this was the middle figure.
Wherefore, as all syllogisms in the middle figure are reduced to universal syllogisms in the first figure, but particular in the first are reduced to those in the middle figure, it is clear that particular will be reduced to universal syllogisms in the first figure.
Those, however, in the third, when the terms are universal, are immediately completed through those syllogisms ;
*1 but when particular (terms) are assumed (they are completed) through particular syllogisms in the first figure ;
but these t have been reduced to those,t so that also particu­ lar syllogisms in the third figure (are reducible * i. e. uni­ versals of the first figure.
t i. e. particu­ lars. ‡ Universals. to the same).
Wherefore, it is evident that all can be re­ duced to universal syllogisms in the first figure ;
and we have therefore shown how syllogisms de inesse and de non inesse subsist, both those which are of thp same figure, with refer­ ence to themselves, and those which are of different figures, also with reference to each other.
SINCE however to exist, to exist necessarily, and to exist contingently are different, (for many things exist, but not from necessity, and others neither necessarily, nor in short exist, yet may hap­ pen to exist,) it is evident that there will be a different syllogism from each of these, and from the terms not being alike;
but one syllogism will con­ sist of those which are necessary, another of absolute, and a third 2..
Necessary syllogisms re­ semble gener­ ally those which are abso­ lute.
of contingent.
In necessary syllogisms it will almost always be the same, as in the case of abso­ lute subsistences,1 for the terms being similarly placed in both absolute existence, and in existing, or not of necessity, there will and there will not be a syllogism, except that there will be a difference in neces­ sary or non-necessary subsistence being added to the terms.
For a negative is in like manner convertible, and we assign similarly to be in the whole of a thing, and to be (predicated) of every.
In the rest then it will be shown by the same manner, through conversion, that the conclusion is necessary, as in the case of being present;
but in the middle figure, when the universal is affirmative, and the particular negative, and again, in the third figure, when the universal is affirmative, but the particular negative, the demonstration will not be in the like manner ;
but it is necessary that proposing something with which either extreme is not present, we make a syllogism of this, for in respect of these there will be a necessary (conclu­ sion).
If, on the other hand, in respect to the proposed term, there is a necessary conclusion, there will be also one (a neces­ sary conclusion) of some individual of that term, for what is proposed is part of it, and each syllogism is formed under its own appropriate figure.
IT sometimes happens also that when one pro­ position is necessary, a necessary syllogism arises,1 not however from either proposition indifferently, but from the one that contains the greater ex­ treme.
2
For example, if A is assumed to be necessarily present or not present with B, but B to be alone present with C, for the premises being thus assumed, A will necessarily be present or 1.

not with C ;
for since
A is or is not necessarily present with every B, but C is something belonging to B, C will evidently of necessity be one of these.*
If, again, A B (the major is not necessary, but B * i. e. will or will not be A. C (the minor) is necessary, there will not be a necessary con­ clusion, for if there be, it will happen that A is necessarily present with a certain B, both by the first and the third figure, but this is false, for B may happen to be a thing of that kind, that A may not be present with any thing of it.
Besides, it is evident from the terms, that there will not be a necessary conclusion, as if A were "motion," B "animal," and C "man," for "man" is necessarily "an animal," but neither are "animal" nor "man" necessarily "moved;
" so also if A B is negative, for there is the same de­ nonstration.
In particular syllogisms, however, f the universal is necessary, the conclusion will 2.

Jso be necessary, but if the particular be, there will not be a necessary conclusion, neither if the universal premise be nega­ tive nor affirmative.
Let then, in the first place, the universal be necessary, and let A be necessarily present with every B, but B only be present with a certain C ;
it is necessary therefore • i. e. is joined to B. that A should of necessity be present with a certain C, for C is under- B, and A was of necessity pre­ sent with every B.
The same will occur if the syllogism be negative, for the demonstration will be the same, but if the particular be necessary, the conclusion will not be t i. e. though a non-necessary conclusion be admitted.

In the second figure, when a necessary is joined with a pure premise, the conclusion follows the ne­ gative neces­ sary premise.-
Example and proof.IN the second figure, if the negative premise be necessary, the conclusion will also be necessary, but if the affirmative (be necessary, the conclu­ sion) will not be necessary.
For first, let the negative be necessary, and let it not be possible for A to be in any B, but let it be present with C alone;
as then a negative proposition may be converted, B cannot be present with any A, but A is with every C, hence B cannot be present with any C, § i. e. belongs to A. ||
The conclu­ sion will be necessary.
for C is under § A.
In like manner also, if the negative be added to C,|| for if A cannot be with any C, neither can C be present with any A, but A is with every B, so neither can C be present with any B, as the first figure will again be produced;
wherefore, neither can B be present with C, since it is simi- 2.

larly converted.
If, however, the affirmative pre­ mise be necessary, the conclusion will not be necessary;
for let A necessarily be present with every B, and alone not be present with any C, then the negative being converted, we have the first figure;
but it was shown in the first, that when the major negative (proposition) is not necessary, neither will the conclusion be necessary, so that neither in these will there be a necessary ¶ i. e. in syllo­ gisms of the second figure with a neces­ sary affirma­ tive.
conclusion.¶
Once more, if the conclusion is necessary, it results that C is not necessarily pre­ sent with a certain A, for if B is necessarily pre­ sent with no C, neither will C be necessarily pre­ sent with any B, but B is present necessarily with a certain A, if A is necessarily present with every B.
Hence, it is necessary that C should not be present with a certain A;
there is, however, nothing to prevent such an A being as­ sumed, with which universally C may be present.
More­ over, it can be shown by exposition of the terms, that the conclusion is not simply necessary, but necessary from the assumption of these, e. g. let A be "animal," B "man."
C " white," and let the propositions be similarly assumed:
for it is possible for an animal to be with nothing " white," then net­ ther will " man" be present with any thing white, yet not from necessity, for it may happen for "man" to be "white," yet not so long as " animal" is present with nothing " white," so that from these assumptions there will be a necessary con­ clusion, but not simply necessary.
The same will happen in particular syllogisms, for when the negative proposition is universal and ne- 3. Case the same with par­ ticulars.
cessary, the conclusion also will be necessary, but when the affirm­ ative is universal and necessary, and the negative particular,.
the conclusion will not be necessary.
First, then, let there be an universal and necessary negative, and let A not possibly be present with any B, but with a certain C. Since, therefore, a * Taylor in­ serts " and not necessary," which words are omitted by Bekker and Waltz.
negative proposition is convertible, B can neither be possibly present with any A, but A is with a certain C, so that of necessity B is not present with a certain C. Again, let there be an universal and necessary affirmative, and let the affirm­ ative be attached to B, if then A is necessarily present with every B, but is not with a certain C, B is not with a certain C it is clear, yet not from necessity, since there will be the same terms for the demonstration, as were taken in the case of universal syllogisms.
Neither, moreover, will the conclu­ sion be necessary, if a particular necessary negative be taken as the demonstration is through the same terms.
IN the last figure, when the terms are universally joined to the middle,1 and both premises are affirmative, if either of them be necessary, the 1.
In this figure if either pre­ mise be neces­ sary, and both be A, the con­ clusion will be necessary.
conclusion will also be necessary;
and if one be negative, but the other affirmative, when the negative is necessary, the conclusion will be also necessary.
but when the affirmative (is so, the conclusion will not be 1st case.
necessary.
For first, let both propositions be1 affirmative, and let A and B be present with every C, and let A C be a necessary (proposition).
Since then B is present with every C, C will also be present with a certain B, because an universal is converted into a parti­ cular :
so that if A is necessarily present with every C, and C with a certain B, A must also be necessarily present with * i. e. belongs to it.
2nd case.
a certain B, for B is under C,* hence the first figure again arises.
In like manner, it can be also de­ monstrated if B C is a necessary (proposition), for C is converted with a certain A, so that if B is necessarily present with every C, (but C with a certain A,) B will also of necessity be present with a certain A. Again let A C be a negative (proposition), but B C affirmative, and let the negative be necessary;
as therefore an affirmative pro­ position is convertible, C will be present with some certain B, but A of necessity with no C, neither will A necessarily 3rd case an ex­ ception.
be present with some B, for B is under C.
But if the affirmative is necessary, there will not be a necessary conclusion;
for let B C be affirmative and necessary, but A C negative and not necessary;
since then the affirmative is converted C will also be with a cer­ tain B of necessity;
wherefore if A is with no C, but C with a certain B, A will also not be present with a certain B, but t Vide ch. 9. not from necessity, for it has been shown by the first figure,† that when the negative proposition is not, necessary, neither will the conclusion be necessary.
Moreover this will also be evident from the terms, for let A be "good," B "animal," and C "horse," it happens therefore that " good" is with no "horse," but "animal" is necessarily present with every " horse," but it is not however necessary that a certain " animal" should not be " good," for every " animal may possibly be " good. *
Or if this is not possible, (viz. that every animal is good,) we * Example (1.) must assume another term, as " to wake," or " to sleep," for every " animal is capable of these.
†
If then the terms are universal in respect to the middle, it has t Example (2.) been shown when there will be a necessary conclusion.
But if one term is universally but the other particularly (predicated of the middle), and both propositions are affirmative, when the universal is necessary the conclusion will also be necessary, for the demonstration is the same as before, since the particular affirmative is convertible.
If there- 2. If one pro­ position be A or I, when A it necessary the conclusion is necessary, but not when 1 is necessary.
fore B is necessarily present with every C, but A is under C, B must also necessarily be present with a certain A,l and if B is with a certain A, A must also be present necessarily with a certain B, for it is convertible;
the same will also occur if A C be a necessary universal proposition, for B is under C.
But if the particular be necessary, there will not be a neces­ sary conclusion, for let B C be particular and necessary, and A present with every C, yet not of necessity, B C then being converted we have the first figure, and the universal propo­ sition is not necessary, but the particular is necessary, but when the propositions are thus there was not a necessary con­ clusion,‡ so that neither will there be one in the case of these.
§ Moreover this is evident from the terms, for let A be " wakefulness," B " biped," but t Vide ch. 6. § Example (3.) C, "animal;
" B then must necessarily be present with a cer- tarn C, but A may happen to be present with every C, and yet A is not necessarily so with B, for a certain " biped " need * Example (4.) t Example (5.) not "sleep or "wake. *
So also we may de­ monstrate it by the same terms if A be particular and necessary.†
But if one term be affirmative and the other negative, when the universal proposition is ne­ gative and necessary, the conclusion will also be necessary, for if A happens to no C, but B is present with a certain C, A must necessarily not be present with a certain B. But 3.
When the affirmative is necessary either A or I, or when O is assumed, there will not be a necessary conclusion.
t Example (6.) when the affirmative is assumed as necessary, whether it be universal or particular, or particular negative, there will not be a necessary conclusion, for we may allege the other same (reasons against it), as in the former cases.
1
But let the terms when the universal affirmative is necessary be "wakefulness," "animal," "man," the middle "man." ‡
But when the particular affirmative is necessary, let the terms be "wakefulness," "animal," " white," for "animal" must necessarily be with something "white," but "wakefulness" happens to be with nothing "white," and it § Example (7.) || Example (8.) is not necessary that wakefulness should not be with a certain animal.
§ But when the negative particular is necessary, let the terms be " biped," "motion," "animal," and the middle term, " animal."
||IT appears then, that there is not a syllogism de inesse un­ less both propositions signify the being present with,2 but that a necessary conclusion follows, even if one alone is necessary.
But in both,.
the syllogisms being affirmative, or negative, one of the propo­ sitions must necessarily be similar to the conclu­ sion ;
I me an by similar, that if (the conclusion) be (simply) that a thing is present with, (one of the propositions also signifies simply) the being pre­ sent with, but if necessarily, (that is, in the con­ clusion, one of the propositions is also) necessary.
Wherefore this also is evident, that there will *i. e. pure and modal.

neither be a conclusion necessary nor simple de inesse, unless one proposition be assumed as necessary, or purely categorical, and concerning the necessary, how it arises, and what differ­ ence it has in regard to the de in ease, we have almost said enough.
LET us next speak of the contingent, when, and how, and through what (propositions) there will be a syllogism ;
and to be contingent, and the contingent, I define to be that which, not being necessary, but being assumed to exist, nothing impossible will on this account arise, for we say 1.
Definition of the contingent.
(τον̄ ἐνὸεχoμέ­ νον) given and confirmed.
(Vide Metaph. lib. v. 2,) also Interpret. 13. that the necessary is contingent equivocally.
But, that such is the contingent, is evident from opposite negatives and affirmatives, for the assertions-" it does not happen to be," and, " it is impossible to be," and, " it is necessary not to be," are either the same, or follow each other;
wherefore also the contraries to these, " it happens to be," " it is not impossible to be," and, " it is not necessary not to be," will either be the same, or follow each other ;
for of every thing, there is either affirmation or negation, hence the contingent will be not necessary, and the not-necessary will be contingent.
It hap- 2. Contingent προτάσεις ca­ pable of con­ version.
pens, indeed, that all contingent propositions are convertible with each other.
I do not mean the affirmative into the negative, but as many as have an affirmative figure, as to opposition ;
e. g. "it happens to exist," (is convertible into) "it happens not to exist," and, " it happens to every," into " it happens to none," or, "not to every," and, "it happens to some," into " it hap­ * i. e. is conver­ lion effected.
pens not to some."
In the same manner also with the rest,.
for since the contingent is non-neces­ sary, and the non-necessary may happen not to exist, it is clear that if A happens to be with any B, it may also happen not to be present, and if it happens to be present with every B, it may also happen not to be present with every B.
There is the same reasoning also in particular affirmatives, for the demonstration is the same, but such propositions are affirmative and not negative, for the verb " to be contingent," t Vide c. 3.
S. The contin­ gent predicated in two ways- the one general, the other inde­ finite-the me­ thod of conver­ lion not the same to each.
is arranged similarly to the verb " to be, as we have said before.
tThese things then being defined, let us next remark, that to be contingent is predicated in two ways, one that which happens for the most part and yet falls short of the necessary-( for instance, for a man to become hoary, or to grow, or to waste, or in short whatever may naturally be, for this has not a continued necessity, for the man may not always exist, but while he does exist it is either of necessity or for the most part)1—the other way (the contin­ gent is) indefinite, and is that which may be possibly thus and not thus;
as for an animal to walk, or while it is walking for an earthquake to happen, or in short whatever occurs casually, for nothing is more naturally produced thus, or in a contrary way.
Each kind of contingent however is convertible according to opposite propositions, yet not in the same manner, but what may naturally subsist is convertible into that which does not subsist of necessity ;
thus it is possible for a man not to be­ come hoary, but the indefinite is converted into what cannot more subsist in this than in that way.
Science however and demonstrative syllogism do not belong to indefinites, because the middle is irregular, but to those things which may na­ turally exist;
and arguments and speculations are generally conversant with such contingencies, but of the indefinite con­ tingent we may make a syllogism, though it is not generally investigated.
These things however will be more defined in what follows,1 at present let us show when and how and what will be a syllogism from contingent propositions.
4. The indefi­ nite contingent of less use in syllogism.
Since then that this happens to be present with that may be assumed in a twofold respect,-( for it either signifies that with which this is present, or that with which it may be present, thus the assertion, A is contingent to that of which B is predicated, signifies one of these things, either that of which B is predicated, or that of which it may be predicated;
but the assertion that A is contingent to that of which there is B, and that A may be present with every B, do not differ from each other, whence it is evident that A may happen to be present with every B in two ways,)—let us first show if B is contingent to that of which there is C, and if A is contin­ gent to that of which there is B, what and what kind of syllo­ gism there will be, for thus both propositions are contingently assumed.
When however A is contingent to that with which B is present, one proposition is de in­ esse, but the other of that which is contingent, so that we must begin from those of similar character, as we began elsewhere.
2 5. An inquiry into the con­ struction of contingent syl­ logisms pre­ pared.
1.
With the contingent pre­ mises both uni­ versal there will be a perfect syllogism.
WHEN A is contingent to every B, and B to every C, there will be a perfect syllogism, so that A is contingent to every C, which is evident from the definition, for thus we stated the universal contingent (to imply).
So also if A is contingent to no B, but B to every C, (it may be concluded) that A is 2nd case.

wherefore if B may happen to every C, and A to every B, the same syllogism will again arise.

When the premises are both negative or the minor negative, there is either no syllogism or an incomplete one —case of the major uni­ versal with the minor particu­ lar, different.
are converted there will be the same as before.
It is evident then that when negation is added to the minor extreme, or to both the propositions, there is either no syllogism, or an incomplete one, for the necessity (of consequence) is completed by conversion.
If however one of the propositions be universal, and the other be assumed as parti­ cular, the universal belonging to the major ex­ treme there will be a perfect syllogism, for if A is contingent to every B, but B to a certain C, A is also con­ tingent to a certain C, and this is clear from the definition of universal contingent.
Again, if A is contingent to no B, but B happens to be present with some C, it is necessary that A should happen not to be present with some C, since the de- monstration is the same;
but if the particular proposition be assumed as negative, and the universal affirmative, and retain the same position as if A happens to be present to eveiy B, but B happens not to be present with some C, no evident syllogism arises from the assumed propositions, but the parti­ cular being converted and B being assumed to be contingently present with some C, there will be the same conclusion as be­ fore in the first syllogisms.

different figure, or both indefinite or particular, there will never be a syllogism;
for there is nothing to prevent B from being more widely extended than A, and from not being equally predicated.
Now let that by which B exceeds A, be assumed to be C, to this it will happen2 that A is present neither to every, nor to none, nor to a certain one, nor not to a certain one, since contingent propositions are convertible, and B may happen to be present to more things than A.
Besides, this is evident from the terms, for when the propo­ sitions are thus, the first is contingent to the last, and to none, and necessarily present with every individual, and let the common terms of all be these;
of being present necessarily3 "animal, "white, ""man, but of not being con­ tingent, "animal," "white," "garment."* There­ * Example (1.) fore it is clear that when the terms are thus there is no syllo- gism, for every syllogism is either de inesse, or of that whicl exists necessarily or contingently, but that this is neither de inesse, nor of that which necessarily exists, is clear, since the affirmative is subverted by the negative, and the negative by the affirmative, wherefore it remains that it is of the con­ tingent, but this is impossible, for it has been shown that when the terms are thus, the first is necessarily inherent in all the last, and contingently is present with none, so that there cannot be a syllogism of the contingent, for the necessary is not contingent.
Thus it is evident that when universal terms 3. When the premises are universal, A or E, there is al­ ways a syllo­ gism in the first figure—the former(A) com­ plete—the lat­ ter (E) incom­ plete.
(Vide last chapter.) are assumed in contingent propositions, there arises always a syllogism in the first figure, both when they are affirmative and negative, except that being affirmative it is complete, but if nega­ tive incomplete, we must nevertheless assume the contingent not in necessary propositions, but ac­ cording to the before-named definition, and some­ times a thing of this kind escapes notice.
1.
No syllogism with mixed premises, pure and modal—if the major is contingent the syllogism will be perfect, not otherwise.
IF one proposition be assumed to exist, but the other to be contingent, when that which contains the major extreme signifies the contingent, all the syllogisms will be perfect and of the contingent, ac­ cording to the above definition.
But when the mi­ nor (is contingent) they will all be imperfect, and the negative syllogisms will not be of the contingent, according to the definition, but of that which is necessarily present with no one or not with every;
for if it is necessarily present with no one, or not with every, we say that " it hap­ pens " to be present with no one and not with every.
Now let A be contingent to every B, and let B be assumed to be present with every C, since then C is included under B, and 1.
Case of a perfect syllo­ gism, when the minor is pure.
A is contingent to every B, A is also clearly con­ tingent to every C, and there is a perfect syllo­ gism.
So also if the proposition A B is negative, but B C affirmative, and A B is assumed as con­ tingent, but B C to be present with (simply), there will be a perfect syllogism, so that A will happen to be present with no C.
It appears then that when a pure minor is assumed the syl­ logisms are perfect, but that when it is of a contrary charac­ ter it may be shown per impossibile that there would be also syllogisms, though at the same time it would be evident that they are imperfect, since the demonstration will not arise from the assumed propositions.
First, however, we must show that if A exists, B must necessarily exist, and that if A is possible, B will necessarily be possible;
let then under these circum­ stances A be possible but B impossible, if therefore the possible, since it is possible to be, may be produced, yet the impossible, because it is impossible, cannot be produced.
But if at the same time A is possible and B impossible, it may happen that A may be produced without B ;
if it is produced also, that it may exist, tor that which has been generated, when it has been so generated, exists.
We must however assume the possible and impossible,l not only in generation, but also in true assertion, and in the inesse, and in as many other ways as the possible is predicated, for the case will be the 2.

same in all of them.
Moreover (when it is said) if A exists B is, we must not understand as if A being a certain thing B will be, for no necessary consequence follows from one thing existing;
but from there being two at least, as in the case of propositions subsisting in the manner we have stated in syllo­ gism.
For if C is predicated of D, but D cf F, C will also necessarily be predicated of F;
and if each be possible, the conclusion will be possible, just as if one should take A as the premises, but B the conclusion;
it will not only happen that A being necessary, B is also necessary, but that when the former is possible, the latter also will be possible.
This being proved, it is manifest that when there is a false and not impossible hypothesis, the consequence of the hypothesis will also be false and not impossible, e. g. if A is false yet not im-
3. From a false hypothesis, not impossible, a similar conclu­ sion follows.
possible, but when A is, B also is,-here B will also be false yet not impossible.
For since it has been shown that A ex- isting, B also exists, when A is possible, B will be also pos­ sible, but A is supposed to be possible, wherefore B will be also possible, for if it were impossible the same thing would be possible and impossible at the same time.
These things then being established, let A be present with every B, and B contingent to every C, therefore A must necessarily hap­ pen to be present with every C ;
for let it not happen, but let B be supposed to be present with every C, this is indeed false yet not impossible ;
if then A is not con­ tingent to C, but B is present with every C, A is not con­ tingent to every B, for a syllogism arises in the third figure.
But it was supposed (that A was) contingently present with every (B), therefore A must necessarily be contingent to every * Example (1.)
C, for the false being assumed, and not the im­ possible,1 the consequence is impossible.-
We may also make a deduction to the impossible in the first figure by assuming B to be present with every C, for if B is with every C, but A contingent to every B, A will also be contin­ t Example (2.) gent to every C, but it was supposed not to be present with every C.†
Still we must assume the being present with every, not distinguishing it by time, as 4 Universal predication has "now," or " at this time," but simply;
for by pro­ positions of this kind, we also produce syllogisms,2 since when a proposition is taken as to the pre­ sent it will not be syllogism;
since perhaps there is nothing to hinder " man " from being present no reference to time.
CY. AId­ rich and Hill's Logic.)
some time or other with every thing moved, viz. if nothing else is moved, but what is moved is contingent to every "horse," yet "man" is contingent to no "horse."
Moreover, let the first term be " animal," the middle, "that which is moved," and the last, "man ;
" the propositions will then be alike, but the conclusion necessary, and not contingent, for "man " is necessarily "an animal," so that it is evident that the universal must be taken simply and not deprived by time.­ * Example (3.)Again, let the proposition A B be universal negative, and let A be assumed to be present with no B, but let B contingently be present with every C ;

from these positions
A must necessarily happen to be present with no C, for let it not so happen, but let B be supposed to be present with C, as before ;
then A must necessarily be present with some B, for there is a syllogism in the third figure, but this is impossible, wherefore A can be contingent to no U, tor the false and not the impossible being assumed, the impossible results.†
Now this syllo­ gism is not of the contingent according to the t Example (4.) (Vide supra.) definition, but of what is necessarily present with none, for this is a contradiction of the given hypothesis, because A was supposed necessarily present with some C, but the syllogism per impossible is of an opposite contradiction.
Besides, from the terms it appears clearly that there is no contingent con­ clusion, for let " crow" stand for A, " that which is intelligent" for B, and "man" for C ;
A is therefore present with no B, for nothing intelligent is a "crow;
" but B is contingent to every C, since it happens to every "man" to be "intelligent," but A is necessarily present with no C, where­ fore the conclusion is not contingent.‡
But ‡ Example (5.) neither is the conclusion always necessary, for let A be "what is moved," B "science," and C "man," A will then be present with no B, but B is contingent to every C, and the conclusion will not be necessary, for it is not necessary that no "man" should be "moved," but also it is not necessary that a certain man should be moved;
therefore it is clear that the conclu­ sion is of that which is necessarily present with no one, hence the terms must be assumed in a better manner.

But if the 3.

negative be joined to the minor extreme, signify­ ing to be contingent, from the assumed propositions there will be no syllogism, but there will be as in the former instances, when the contingent proposition is converted.
For let A be present with every B, but B contingent to no C, now when the terms are thus, there will be nothing necessary inferred, but if B C be converted, and B be assumed to be contingent to every C, a syllogism arises as before, since the terms have a similar position.

Both pre­ mises negative.
B signifies not being present, but B C to be contingent to no individual, through these assumptions no necessity arises, but the contingent proposition being converted, there will be a syllogism.
Let A be assumed present to no B, and B contin­ gent to no C, nothing necessary is inferred from these;
but if it is assumed that B is contingent to every C, which is true, and the proposition A B subsists similarly, there will be again the same syllogism.
If however B is assumed as not present with C, and not that it happens not to be pre­ sent, there will by no means be a syllogism, neither if the proposition A B be negative nor affirmative ;
but let the com­ mon terms of necessary presence be "white," "animal," "snow, and of non-contingency "white, "ani­ mal," "pitch." *
It is evident, therefore, that when terms are universal, and one of the propositions is assumed, as simply de inesse, but the other con­ tingent, when the minor premise is assumed con­ tingent, a syllogism always arises, except that sometimes it will be produced from the proposi­ tions themselves, and at other times from the (con­ tingent) proposition being converted ;
when, how­ * Example (6.)

ever, each of these occurs, and for what reason, we have shown.
But if one proposition be assumed as universal, and the other particular, when the universal contin­ gent is joined to the major extreme, whether it be affirmative or negative, but the particular is a simple affirmative de inesse, there will be a perfect 6.

Now when the major is 2.

proposition, as in the former cases.
There will also be a syllogism, through conversion, when the universal major signifies simply inesse, or non-inesse, but the particular being negative, assumes the contingent, as if A is present, or not present, with every B, that B happens not to be present with a certain C ;
for the contingent proposition 4.
B C being converted, there is a syllogism.
Still when the particular proposition assumes the not being present with, there will not be a syllogism.
Now let the terms of presence be "white," "animal," "snow," but of not being present "white," "animal," "pitch," for the demon­ * Example (7.)

stration must be assumed through the indefinite.*
Yet if the universal be joined to the less extreme, but particular to the greater, whether negative or affirmative, contingent or pure, there will by no means be a syllogism, nor if particular or inde­ finite propositions be assumed, whether they take the contingent, or simply the being present with, or vice versa, will there thus be a syllogism, and the demon­ stration is the same as before;
let however the common terms of being present with from necessity be "animal," "white," t Example (8.) "man;
" and of not being contingent "animal," "white," "garment."†
Hence it is evident, that if the major be universal, there is always a syllogism, but if the minor be so, (if the major be particular,) there will never be.1.
The law re­ lative to syllo­ gisms of this character.
WHEN one is a necessary proposition simple, de inesse, or non-inesse, and the other signifies being contingent, there will be a syllogism, the terms subsisting similarly, and it will be perfect when the minor premise1 is necessary;
the conclusion however, when the terms are affirmative, will be contingent, and not simple, whether they are universal or not universal.
Nevertheless, if one proposition be affirmative, and the other negative, when the affirmative is necessary, the conclusion will in like manner signify the being contingent, and not the not-existing or being present with;
and when the negative is necessary, the con­ clusion will be of the contingent non-inesse, and of the sim­ ple non-inesse, whether the terms are universal or not.
The contingent also in the conclusion, is to be assumed in the same way as in the former syllogisms, but there will not be a syllo­ gism wherein the non-inesse will be necessarily inferred, for it is one thing "inesse" not necessarily, and another "non- inesse" necessarily.
Wherefore, it is evident that when the terms are affirmative, there will not be a necessary conclusion.
For let A necessarily be present with every B, but let B be contingent to every C, there will then be an incomplete syllo-

gism, whence it may be inferred that A happens to be present with every C;
but that it is incomplete, is evident from de- monstration, for this may be shown after the same manner as in the former syllogisms.
Again, let A be contingent to every B, but let B be necessarily present with every C, there will then be a syllogism wherein A happens to be present with every C, but not (simply) is it present with every C, also it will be complete, and not incomplete, for it is completed by the first 1.

propositions.
Notwithstanding, if the propositions are not of similar form, first, let the negative one be necessary, and let A necessarily be contingent to no B, but let B be contingent to every C;
therefore, it is necessary that A should be present with no C;
for let it be assumed present, either with every or with some one, yet it was supposed to be contingent to no B.
Since then a negative proposition is convertible, neither will B be contingent to any A, but A is supposed to be present with every or with some C, hence B will happen to be present with no, or not with every C, it * Example (1.) was however supposed, from the first, to be pre­ sent with every C.*
Still it is evident, that there may also be a syllogism of the contingent non-inesse, as there 2.
Affirmative necessary.
is one of the simple non-inesse.
Moreover, let the affirmative proposition be necessary, and let A be contingently present with no B, but B necessarily pre­ sent with every C:
this syllogism then will be perfect, yet not of the simple, but of the contingent non-inesse, for the proposition (viz. the contingent non-inesse) was assumed from the major extreme, and there cannot be a deduction to the impossible, for if A is supposed to be present with a certain C, and it is admitted that A is contingently present with no B, nothing impossible will arise therefrom.
But if the minor 3. Minor nega­ tive contingent.
premise be negative when it is contingent, there will be a syllogism by conversion, as in the former cases, but when it is not contingent, there will not be;
nor when both premises are negative, but the minor not contin­ gent :
let the terms be the same of the simple inesse " white," t Example (2.) "anima,""snow," and of the non-inesse white, It animal," "pitch."
†The same will also happen in particular syllogisms, for when 3.

1. the negative is necessary, the conclusion will be of the simple non-inesse.
Thus if A is contingently present with no B, but B contingently present with a certain C. it is necessary that A should not be present with a certain C, since if it is present with every C, but is contingent to no B, neither will B be contingently pres( nt with any A.
So that if A is present with every C, B is con­ tingent with no C, but it was supposed contingent to a cer­ tain C.
When however in a negative syllogism the particular affirmative is necessary, as for example B C, or the universal in an affirmative syllogism, e. g. A 2.
B, there will not be a syllogism de inesse, the demon­ stration however is the same as in the former cases.
But if the minor premise be universal, whether affirm­ ative or negative and contingent, but the major 3.
particular necessary, there will not be a syllogism, let the terms of necessary presence be "animal," "white," "man," and of the non-contingent "animal " white, " garment." * But when the universal is neces­ *Example (3.) sary, and the particular contingent, the universal being nega­ tive, let the terms of presence1 be "animal," "white," "crow," and of non-inesse "animal," " white," " pitch."
†But when (the universal) affirms let the terms of presence be " animal," " white," " swan," but of the non-contingent be " animal," " white," " snow." ‡
Nor will there be a syllogism when in­ definite propositions are assumed or both particular, let the common terms, de inesse, be "animal," "white," " man," de non-inesse " animal," " white," t Example (4.) 4. ‡ Example (5.) 4. Case of both premises inde­ finite or parti­ cular. " inanimate;

" the like also occurs in the contingent, so that these terms are useful for all.-
From what has been said then it appears that when the terms are alike both in simple and in necessary propositions, 5. Conclusion from the above.
(Compare c. 15.) a syllogism does and does not occur, except that if the negative proposition be assumed de inesse there will be a syllogism with a contingent (con­ elusion), but when the negative is necessary there will be one of the character of the contingent and of the non-inesse, but it is clear also that all the syllogisms are incomplete,1 and that they are completed through the above-named figures.
1.
Rule for con­ tingent syllo­ gisms in this figure.
IN the second figure, when both premises are as­ sumed contingent, there will be no syllogism, nei­ ther when they are taken as affirmative, nor nega­ tive, nor universal, nor particular;
but when one signifies the simple inesse, and the other the contingent, if the affirmative signifies the inesse, there will never be a syllogism, but if the universal negative (be pure, there will) always (be a syllogism).
In the same manner, when one premise is assumed as necessary, but the other contingent;
still in these syllogisms we must consider the contingent in the conclusions, as we did in the former ones.
Now in the first place, we must show that a contingent negative is not con­ vertible, e. g. if A is contingent to no B, it is not 2.
Terms of a contingent ne­ gative not con­ vertible.
necessary that B should also be contingent to no A.
For let this be assumed, and let B be contingently present with no A, there­ fore since contingent affirmatives, both contrary and contra­ dictory, are convertible into negatives, and B is contingently present with no A, it is clear that B may be contingently present with every A;
but this is false, for if this is contingent to all of that, it is not necessary 1. that that should be contingent to this, wherefore a negative (contingent) is not convertible.
Moreover, there is nothing to prevent
A being contingent to no B, but B not necessarily present with a certain A, e. g. "whiteness " may happen not to be present with every "man," (for it may also happen) to be present;
but it is not true to say, that man is contingently present with nothing " white," for he is necessarily not pre­ sent with many things (white), and the necessary is not the contingent.
Neither can it be shown convertible per impos­ sibile, as if a man should think, since it is false that B is con­ tingently present with no A, that it is true that it (A) is not contingent to no one (B), for these are 2. affirmation and negation;
but it this be true B is necessarily present with a certain A, therefore A is also with a certain B, but this is impossible, since it does not follow if B is not con­ tingent to no A, that it is necessarily present with a certain A. ror not to be contingent to no individual, is pre­ dicated two ways, the one if a thing is necessarily present with something, and the other if it is necessarily not present with something.
For what necessarily is not present with a certain A, can­ not be truly said to be contingently not present 3.
Contingency predicated ne­ gatively in two ways-the cha­ racter of the consequent opposition.
with every A;
as neither can what is necessarily present with a certain thing, be truly said to be contingently present with every thing;
if, then, any one thinks that because C is not contingently present with every D, it is necessarily not present with a certain D, he would infer falsely, for, per­ chance, it is present with every D;
still because a thing is necessarily present with certain things, on this account, we say that it is not contingent to every individual.
Wherefore the being present necessarily with a certain thing, and the not being present with a certain thing necessarily, are op­ posed to the being contingently present with every individual, and in like manner, there is a similar opposition to the being contingent to no individual.
Hence it is evident, that when the contingent and non-contingent are taken, in the manner we first defined, not only the necessarily being present with a certain thing, but also the necessarily not being present with it, ought to be assumed;
but when this is assumed, there is no impossibility to a syllogism being produced, whence it is evident, from what we have stated, that a negative con­ tingent is not convertible.
4.
From two premises uni­ versal (A) or (E) contingent in the 2nd figure, no syllo­ gism is con­ structed.
This then being demonstrated, let A be as- Burned contingent to no B, but contingent to every C;
by conversion, therefore, there will not be a syllogism, for it has been said that a proposi­ tion of this kind is inconvertible, neither, however, will there be by a deduction per impossibile.
For B being assumed contingently present with every C, nothing false will happen, for A may contingently be present with * Example (1.) every, and with no C.*1
In short, if there is a syllogism, it is clear that it will be of the contin­ gent, (because neither proposition is assumed as de inesse,) and this either affirmative, or negative;
it is possible, how­ ever, in neither way, since, if the affirmative be assumed, it can be shown by the terms, that it is not contingently present;
but if the negative, that the conclusion is not contingent, but necessary.
For let A be "white," B "man," and C "horse," A therefore, i. e. "whiteness," is contingently present with every individual of the one, though with no individual of the other, but B is neither contingently present, nor yet contingently not present, with C.
It is evident that it is not contingently present, for no "horse" is "a man," but neither does it hap­ pen not to be present, for it is necessary that no " horse" should be " a man, and the necessary is not the contingent, wherefore there is no syllogism.*
This * Example (2.) may be also similarly shown, if the negative be transposed,1 and if both propositions be assumed affirmative, or negative, for the demonstration will be by the same terms.†
When one proposition also is uni­ versal, but the other particular, or both particular or indefinite, or in whatever other way it is pos­ sible to change the propositions, for the demon­ stration will always be through the same terms.‡
Hence it is clear that if both propositions are as­ sumed contingent there is no syllogism.2 t Example (3.) 5. Nor from one univ. and the other par., or both par.

‡ Example (4.*IF one proposition signifies inesse, but the other the contingent, the affirmative proposition being simple, but the negative contingent, there will never be a syllogism, neither if the terms be as-

sumed universally, or partially, still the demon­ stration will be the same, and by the same terms, yet when the affirmative is contingent, but the negative sim­ ple, there will be a syllogism.
For let A be assumed present 1. with no B, but contingent with every C, then by conversion of the negative, B will be present with no A, but A is contingent to every C, therefore there is a syllogism in the first figure, that B is contingent to no C.
So also if the negative be added to C;
but if both propositions be negative, and one signifies the simple, but the other the contingent non-inesse, from these assumed propositions nothing necessary is inferred, but the contingent proposition being converted,1 there is a syllogism, wherein B is contingently present with no C, as in the former, for again there will be the first figure.
If, however, both propositions be assumed affirmative, there will not be a syllogism :
let the terms of presence be "health," "animal," "man," but of not being present with "health," " horse," " man."*
The same will happen in the case of particular syllogisms, for when the affirmative is pure, taken either universally, or particularly, there will be no syllogism, and this is shown in like manner through the same terms as be­ fore.!
But when the negative is simple, there 2 ' Example (1.)
2. Particular syllogisms.
t Example (2.) will be a syllogism by conversion, as in the former cases.
Again, if both premises be taken negative, and that which signi­ fies simply the non-inesse be universal;
from these propositions no necessity will result, but the contingent being converted as before there will be a syllogism.
If however the negative be pure but particular, there will not be a syllogism, whether the other premise be affirmative or negative.
Neither will there be one, when both propositions are assumed indefinite, whether affirmative, negative, or particular, and the demonstration is the same and by the same terms.t ‡ Example (3.)IF however one premise signifies the being present necessarily, but the other contingently, when the negative is necessary there will be a syllogism, wherein not only the contingent but also the simple non-inesse (maybe inferred), but when the affirm a­ tive (is necessary) there will be no syllogism.
For 1.
Rule, in these when the negative pre­ mise is neces­ sary, a syllo­ gism may be constructed.
1. Case. let A be assumed necessarily present with no B, but contingent to every C, then by conversion of the negative neither will B be present with any A, but A was contingent to every C, wherefore there is again a syllogism in the first figure, so that B is con­ tingently present with no C.
At the same time it is shown that neither is B present with any C, for let it be assumed to be present, therefore if A is contingent to no B, but B is present with a certain C, A is not contingent to a certain C, but it was supposed contingent to every C, and it may be shown after the same manner, if the negative be added to C. Again, 2. Case of a ne­ cessary affirm­ ative.
let the affirmative proposition be necessary, but the other negative and contingent, and let A be contingent to no B, but necessarily present with every C ;
now when the terms are thus, there will be no syl­ logism, for it may happen that B is necessarily not present with C.
Let A be " white," B " man," C " a swan;
" "white­ ness," then, is necessarily present with " a swan," but is con­ tingent to no "man," and " man " is necessarily present with no "swan;
" therefore that there will be no syllogism of the * Example (1.) contingent is palpable, for what is necessary is not contingent.*1
Yet neither will there be a syllogism of the necessary, for the latter is either inferred from two ne­ cessary premises, or from a negative (necessary premise) ;
be­ sides, from these data it follows that B may be present with C, for there is nothing to prevent C from being under B, and A from being contingent to every B, and necessarily present with C, as if C is "awake," B "animal," and A "motion;

Hence it appears that neither the non-inesse is inferred, since if the terms are thus the inesse is necessary, nor when the enunci­ ations are opposite,2 so that there will be no syllogism.
There will be also a similar demonstration if the affirm­ ative premise be transposed, But if the proposi­ tions are of the same character, when they are S. Case of both negative.

For let A be assumed necessarily not present with B, and contingently not present with C, then the propositions being converted, B is present with no A, and A is contingent with every C, and the first figure is produced ;
the same would also occur if the negation belongs to C.

not assumed, nei­ ther in the simple, nor in the necessary inesse.
Neither, again, will there be a syllogism of the contingent non- inesse, for necessary terms being assumed, B will not be pre­ sent with C, e. g. if A be assumed "white," B "a swan," and C "man;
" nor will there be from opposite affirmations, since B has been shown necessarily not present with C, in short, * Example (3.)
2. Particular syllogisms.
therefore, a syllogism will not be produced.-
It will happen the same in particular syllogisms, for when the negative is universal and necessary, there will always be a syllogism of the contingent, and of the non-inesse, but the demonstration will be by conversion ;
still, when the affirmative (is necessary), there will never be a syllogism, and this may be shown in t Example (4.) ‡ Example (5.) the same way as in the universals, and by the same terms.t
Nor when both premises are as­ sumed affirmative, for of this there is the same demonstration as before,‡ but when both are ne­ gative, and that which signifies the non-inesse is universal, and necessary;
the necessary will not be concluded through the propositions, but the contingent being converted, there will be a syllogism as before.
If however both propositions are laid down indefinite, or particular, there will not be a syllogism, § Example (6.) and the demonstration is the same, and by the same terms.

but with a necessary affirmative, there will never be a syllogism ;
also that when the terms subsist in the same manner, in necessary, as in simple propositions, there is, and is not, a syllogism;
lastly, that all these syllogisms are incomplete, and that they are completed through the above-mentioned figures.

also if one premise signifies the contingent, but the other, the simple inesse.
Still when one premise is as­ sumed necessary, if it be affirmative, there will not be a conclu­ sion either necessary or simple, if on the contrary it is nega­ tive, there will be- a syllogism of the simple non-inesse as be­ fore ;
in these however the contingent must be similarly taken in the conclusions.
First then let the premises be contingent, and let A and B be contingently present with every C ;
since therefore a particular 1.

affirmative is convertible, but B is contingent to every C, C will also be contingent to a certain B, therefore if A is con­ tingent to every C, but C is contingent to a certain B, it is necessary also that A should be contingent to a certain B, for the first figure is produced.
If again A is con­ tingently present with no C, but B with every C, 2.
A must also of necessity be contingently not present with a certain B, for again there will be the first figure by conver­ sion ;
1 but if both propositions be assumed negative from these the necessary will not result, but the propositions being converted there will be a syllogism as be- 3. fore.
For if A and B are contingently not present with C, if the contingently not present be changed, there will again be of, One premise universal and the other par­ ticular.

If however ono term be universal but the other particular, whei.
they are so, as in the case of simple incase, there will, and will not, be a syllogism;
for let A be contingently present with every C, and B present with a certain C, there will again be the first figure by con­ version of the particular proposition, since if A is contingent to every C, and C to a certain B, A is also contingent to a certain B, and in like manner if the universal be joined to B 5.

there will be when they are converted as before.
Lastly, when both are indefinite or particular, there will not be a syllogism, for A must neces­ sarily be present with every and with no B, let the terms de inesse be "animal," "man," "white," and de non-in­ * Example (1.) ease "horse," "man," "white," the middle term "white."

(Vide supra.) 1st case, Both affirmative.
IF however one premise signifies the inesse, but the other the contingent, the conclusion will be that a thing is contingent to, and not that it is present with (another), and there will be a syllo­ gism, the terms subsisting in the same manner as the previous ones.
For, first, let them be affirm­ ative, and let A be in every C, but B contingent with every C;
B C then being converted there will be the first figure, and the conclusion will be that A is contingently present with a certain B, for when one premise in the first figure signifies the contingent, the conclusion also 2nd, Minor sim­ ple affirmative, major contin­ was contingent.

tive.
both ways the conclusion will be contingent, since again there arises the first figure.
Now it has been shown that where one premise in that figure signifies the contingent, the con­ clusion also will be contingent;
if however the negative be annexed to the minor premise, or both be as­ sumed as negative, through the propositions laid down themselves, there will not indeed be a syllo­ gism, but by their conversion 2 there will be, as in the former cases.
3rd, From a ne­ gative minor or from two nega­ tives, no syllo­ gism results.
Nevertheless if one premise be universal and the other particular, yet both affirmative, or the 4.
Cases of particulars.
universal negative but the particular affirmative, there will be the same mode of syllogisms;
for all are com­ pleted by the first figure, so that it is evident there 1. will be a syllogism of the contingent and not of the inesse.
If however the affirmative be universal and the negative par ticular, the demonstration will be per impossible ;
for let B be with every C and A happen not to be 2.
with a certain C, it is necessary then that A should happen not to be with a certain B, since if A is necessarily with every B, but B is assumed to be with every C, A will necessarily be with every C, which was demonstrated before, but by hypothesis A happens not to be with a certain C.
When both premises are assumed indefinite, or particular, there will not be a syllogism, and the demonstration is the same as in universal and by the same terms.­ * Example (1.)1.
Rules for universals in the third figure, with one neces­ sary, and the other contin­ gent premise.
IF one premise be necessary, but the other con­ tingent, the terms being affirmative there will be always a syllogism of the contingent;
but when one is affirmative but the other negative, if the affirmative be necessary there will be a syllogism of the contingent non-inesse;
if however it be negative, there will be one both of the contingent and of the absolute non-inesse.
There will not however be a syllogism of the necessary non-inesse, as neither in the other figures.
Let then, first, the terms be affirmative, and let A be neces­ :

sarily with every C, but B happen to be with every C ;
therefore since
A is necessarily with every C, but C is contingent to a certain B, A will also be contingently, and not necessarily, with some certain B ;
for thus it is concluded in the first figure.
It can be similarly proved * Example (1.) if B C be assumed as necessary, but A C contin­ gent.-
2. Major nega­ tive, minor affirmative.
Again, let one premise be affirmative, but the other negative, and let the affirmative be neces­ sary ;
let also A happen to be with no C, but let B necessarily be with every C ;
again there will be the first figure ;
1 for the negative premise signifies the being contingent, it is evident therefore that the conclusion will be contingent, for when the premises were thus in the first figure, the conclusion was also contingent.
But if the negative premise be neces­ sary, the conclusion will be that it is contingent, not to be with something, and that it is not with it;
for let A be supposed necessarily not with C, but contingent to every B, then the affirmative proposition B C being converted, there will be the first figure, and the negative premise will be necessary.
But when the premises are thus, it results that A happens not to be with a certain C, and that it is not with it;
wherefore it is ne­ cessary also that A should not be with a certain B.
When however the minor premise is assumed ne-

gative there will be a syllogism, if that be contingent by the premise being converted as in the former cases, but if it be ne­ cessary there will not be, for it is necessary to be with every, and happens to be with none ;
let the terms of being with every in­ dividual, be “sleep,” a sleeping horse," "man ;
" of being with none " sleep," a "waking horse," " man."* * Example (2.)It will happen in the same way, if one term be joined to the middle universally, but the other partially, for both being affirmative there will be 4.

a syllogism of the contingent, and not of the absolute, also when the one is assumed as negative but the other affirmative, and the affirmative is necessary.
But when the negative is necessary, the conclusion will also be of the not being present with;
for there will be the same mode of demonstration, whether the terms are universal or not universal, since it is necessary that the syllogisms be completed by the first figure, so that it is requisite that the same should result, in these, 1 as in those.
1
When however the negative, universally as.
Burned, is joined to the less extreme, if it be contingent, there will be a syllogism by conversion, but if it be necessary there will not be, and this may be shown in the same mode as in 4 Example (3.) universal, and by the same terms. †
Wherefore in this figure it it is evident, when and how there will be a syllogism,2 and when of the contingent, and when of the absolute, all also it is clear are imperfect, and are perfected by the first figure.
1.
Observations preliminary to proving that every syllogism results from universals of the first figure.
THAT the syllogisms then in these figures are com­ pleted by the universal syllogisms in the first figure, and are reduced to these, is evident from what has been said ;
but that in short every syllo­ gism is thus, will now be evident, when it shall be shown that every syllogism is produced by some one of these figures.
2 Syllogism must demon­ strate the abso­ lute univers­ ally or particu­ larly.
Of the os­ tensive.
It is then necessary that every demonstration, and every syllogism, should show either something inesse or non-inesse, and this either universally or partially, moreover either ostensively or by hypothesis.
A part however of that which is by hypothesis is produced per impossible, therefore let us first speak of the ostensive (syllogisms), and when these are shown, it will be evident also in the case of those lead­ ing to the impossibile, and generally of those by hypothesis.
S.
For a aim­ ple conclusion we must have two proposi­ tions.
If then it is necessary to syllogize A of B either as being with or as not being with, we must as­ sume something of something, if then A be as­ sumed of B, that which was from the first (pro­ posed) will be assumed (to be proved), but if A be assumed of C, but C of nothing, nor any thing else of it, nor of A, there will be no syllogism, for there is no necessary result from as­ suming one thing of one, so that we must take another pre­ mise.
If then A be assumed of something else, or something else of A, or of C, there is nothing to hinder a syllogism, it will not however appertain to B I from the assumptions.
Nor when C is predicated of something else, and that of another, and this last of a third,2 if none of these belong to B, neither thus will there be a syllogism with reference to B, since in short we say that there never will be a syllogism of one thing in respect of another unless a certain middle is assumed, which refers in some way to each extreme in predication.
For a syllogism is simply from premises, but that which pertains to this in relation to that, is from premises belonging to this in relation to that,3 but it is impossible to assume a premise re­ lating to B, if we neither affirm nor deny any thing of it, or again of A in relation to B, if we assume nothing common, but affirm or deny certain peculiarities of each.
Hence a certain middle of both must be taken, which unites the predications, if there shall be a syllogism of one in relation to the other;
now if it is necessary to assume something common to both, this happens in a three-fold manner, (since 4.
These con­ nected by a middle term;
which con­ nexion is three- fold.
(Vide AId rich.) we either predicate A of C, and C of B, 4 or C5 of both or both of C,6) but these are the before-mentioned figures—it is evident that every syllogism is necessarily produced by some one of these figures, for there is the same reasoning, if A be connected with B, even through many media, for the figure in many media will be the same.
Wherefore that all ostensive syllogisms are perfected by the above-named figures is clear, also that those per impossibile (are so perfected) will appear from these, for all syllogismi concluding 2.
Of syllo­ gisms per im­ possibile there is the same method.
per impossibile collect the false, but they prove by hypothesis the original proposition, when contradiction being admitted some impossibility results,7 as for instance that the diameter of a square is incommensurate with the side, because, a common measure being given, the odd would be equal to the even.
They collect then that the odd would be equal to the even, but show from hypothesis that the diameter is incommen­ surate, since a falsity occurs by contradiction.
This then it I.
What this kind of syllo­ gism is.
is, to syllogize per impossibile, namely, to show an impossibility from the original hypothesis, so that as by reasonings leading to the impossible, an ostensive syllogism of the false arises, but the original propo­ sition is proved by hypothesis ;
and we have before said about ostensive syllogisms, that they are perfected by these figures—it is evident that syllogisms also per impossibile will be formed through these figures.
Likewise all others which are by hypothesis, for in all there is a syllogism of that which is assumed, 1 but the original proposition is proved by con­ fession, or some other hypothesis.
Now if this is true, it is necessary that every demonstration and syllogism should arise 3.
Also of syllo­ gisms, έξ ὺπο­ θέσεως—re­ capitulation.
through the three figures before named, and this being shown, it is manifest that every syllogism is completed in the first figure, and is reduced to universal syllogisms in it.
1.
One affirma­ tive and one universal term necessary,in all syllogisms.
(Proof.)MOREOVER it is necessary in every syllogism, that one term should be affirmative and one universal, for without the universal there will not be a syllo­ gism, or one not pertaining to the thing proposed, or the original (question) will be the subject of petition.
2
For let it be proposed that pleasure from music is commendable, if then any one should require it to be granted that pleasure is commendable, and did not add all pleasure, there would not be a syllogism, but if that a certain pleasure is so, if indeed it is a different pleasure, it is nothing to the purpose, but if it is the same it is a petitio principii, this will however be more evident in diagrams, for instance, let it be required to show that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal.
1
Let the lines A B be drawn to the centre of a circle, if then he assumes the angle A C to be equal to the angle B D, not in short requiring it to be granted that the angles of semicircles are equal, and again that C is equal to D, not assuming the whole (angle) of the section, if besides he assumes that equal parts being taken from equal whole angles, the re­ maining angles E F are equal, he will beg the original (question), unless he assume that if equals are taken from equals the remain­ ders are equal.
Wherefore in all syllogism we must have an universal;
universal is also shown from all universal terms, but the particular in this or that way, so that if the conclusion be universal, the terms must of necessity be universal, but if the terms be universal, the conclusion may happen not to be universal.
It appears also that in every syllogism either both premises or one of them must be similar to the conclusion, I mean not only in its being affirm­ ative or negative,but in that it is either necessary, or absolute, or contingent;
we must also have regard to other modes of predication.
2
2. An universal conclusion fol­ lows from uni­ versal premises but sometimes only a particu­ lar results.
3. One premise must resemble the conclusion in character and quality.
In a word then it is shown when there will and will not be a syllogism, also when it is posse, and when per­ fect, and that when there is a syllogism it must have its terms according to some one of the above modes.
4. Recapitula­ tion.1.
Demonstra­ tion is convey­ ed by three terms only­ proof.IT appears that every demonstration will be by three terms and no more, unless the same con­ clusion should result through different arguments, as E2 through A B,3 and through C D,4 or through A B, A C, and B C, for there is nothing to prevent many media subsisting of the same (conclusions).
But these being (many), there is not one syllogism, but many syllogisms;
or again, when each of the propositions A B is assumed by syl­ *F the major, G the minor.
logism, as A through D E,5 and again B through F G,* or when the one is by induction,6 but the other by syllogism.
Thus in this manner indeed there are many syllogisms, for there are many conclusions, as A and B and C, and if there are not many but one, it is thus 2.
The same conclusion may arise from many syllo­ gisms.
t i. e. that there should be more than three terms.
possible, that the same conclusion may arise through many syllogisms, but in order that C may be proved through A B, it is impossible.†
For let the conclusion be E, collected from A B C D, it is then necessary that some one of these should be assumed with reference to something else, as a whole, but another as a part, for this has been shown before, that when there is a syllogism, some of the terms should necessarily thus subsist;
let then A be thus with reference to B, from these there is a certain conclusion, which is either E or C or D, or some other different from these.
Now if E is concluded, the syllogism would be from A B alone, but if C D are so as that the one is universal, and the other particular, something also will result from these which will either be E or A or B, or something else different from these, and if E is collected, or A or B, there will be either many syllogisms, or, as it was shown possible, the same thing will happen to be collected through many terms.
If, however, any thing else different from these is collected, there will be many syllogisms unconnected with each other;
but if C is not so with respect to D, as to produce a syllogism, they will be assumed to no purpose, except for the sake of induction or concealment, or something of the sort.
Still if from A B, not E, but some other conclusion is produced, and from C D, either one of these, or something different from these, many syllogisms arise, yet not of the subject, for it was supposed that the syllogism is of E.
If, again, there is no conclusion from C D, it will happen that they are assumed in vain, and the syllogism is not of the primary problem, so that it is evi­ dent that every demonstration and every syllogism will be through three terms only.
1This then being apparent, it is also clear that a syllogism consists of two premises and no more;
for three terms are two premises, unless some­ thing is assumed over and above, as we observed at first, for the perfection of the syllogisms.
3. These three terms are in­ cluded in two propositions.
Vide Aldrich and Whately.
Hence it appears, that in the syllogistic discourse, in which the premises, through which the principal conclusion is col­ lected, are not even,—(for it is requisite that some of the former conclusions should be premises,)—this discourse is either not syllogistically constructed,2 or has required more than is necessary to the thesis.
When then the syllogisms are taken according to the prin­ cipal propositions, every syllogism will consist of propositions which are even, but of terms which are odd for the terms exceed the premises by one, and the conclusions will be half part of the premises.'
When, however, the conclusion results through pro-syllogisms, or through many continued middles,2 o παρεπινπτων ό̉ροςncidens terminus.
Buhle.
as A B through C D, the multitude of terms, in like manner, will exceed the premises by one, (for the term interpolated will be added either exter­ nally or in the middle;
but in both ways it will happen that the intervals are fewer than the terms by one,) but the propositions are equal to the intervals, the former, indeed, will not always be even, but the latter odd, but alter­ nately, when the propositions are even the terms are odd, but when the terms are even the propositions are odd;
for toge­ ther with the term, one proposition is added wherever the 4.
Of the num­ ber of terms, propositions, and conclu­ sions in com­ posite syllo­ gisms.
term is added.
3
Hence, since the propositions were even, but the terms odd, it is necessary they should change when the same addition is made;
but the conclusions will no longer have the same order, neither with respect to the terms, nor to the propositions, for one term being added, con­ clusions will be added less than the pre-existent terms by one, * The minor.
because to the last term alone.
there is no con­ clusion made;
but to all the rest, e. g. if D is added to A B C, two conclusions are immediately added, the one to A and the other to B.
The same occurs in the other cases also, if the term be inserted in the middle after the same manner, for it will not make a syllogism to one term alone, so that the conclusions will be many more than the terms, and than the propositions.
1.
The conclu­ sion by more figures consti­ stutes the reta-SINCE we have those particulars with which syl­ logisms are conversant, and what is their quality in each figure, and in how many ways demon- stration takes place, it is also manifest to us, what kind of problem is difficult, and what easy of proof, for that which is concluded in many figures, and through many cases, is more easy, but tive facility of demonstration.
Enumeration of the conclu­ sion in the se­ cond figures.
what is in fewer figures, and by fewer cases, is more difficult.
An universal affirmative then is proved through the-first figure alone, and by this in one way only;
but a negative, both through the first and through the middle, through the first in one way, but through the middle in two ways ;
the particular affirmative again through the first and through the last, in one way through the first figure, but in three ways through the last;
lastly, the particular negative is proved in all the figures, but in the first in one way, in the middle in two ways, and in the last in three ways.
Hence it appears most difficult to construct an universal affirmative, but most easy to subvert it, in short, universals are easier to subvert than particulars, because the 2.

former are subverted, whether a thing is present with nothing, or is not with a certain thing, of which the one, namely, the not being with a certain thing, is proved in all the figures, and the other, the being with nothing, is proved in two.
The same mode also prevails in the case of negatives, for the original proposition is subverted, whether a thing is with every, or with a certain individual, 1 now this was in two figures.
In particular problems there is one way (of confutation), either by showing a thing to be with every, or with no individual, and parti­ cular problems are easier of construction, for they are in more figures, and through more modest In 3.
Particulars easier of con­ struction.
short, we ought not to forget that it is possible to confute universal mutually through particular problems, and these through universal, yet we cannot construct universal through particular, but the latter may be through the former, at the same time that it is easier to subvert than to construct is plain.
In what manner then every syllogism arises, through how 4.
Recapitula­ tion.
many terms and premises, how they subsist with reference to each other, also what sort of problem may be proved in each figure, and what in many and in fewer modes, may be gathered from what has been said.
11. How to pro­ vide syllo­ gisms, from certain princi­ ples.WE must now describe how we may always obtain a provision of syllogisms for a proposed question, and in what way we may assume principles about each, for perhaps it is not only requisite to con­ sider the production of syllogisms, but also to possess the power of forming them.
2.
The several sorts of predi­ cates.
Some cannot be truly predicated uni­ versally, of other than in­ dividuals, etc.
Of all beings then, some are of such a nature as not to be truly predicated universally of any thing else, as “Cleon," and “ Callias," that which is singular,3 and that which is sensible, but others are predicated of these, (for each of these is man and animal);
some again are predicated of others, but others not previously of these;
lastly, there are some which are themselves predicated of others, and others of them, as “ man " is predicated of Callias, and “ animal" of man.
That some things therefore are naturally adapted to be predicated of nothing is clear, for of sensibles each is almost of such a sort, as not to be predicated of any thing except accidentally, for we sometimes say that that white thing is Socrates, and that the object approaching is Callias.
But that we must stop some- Vide b. i.ch. 19, Post Anal., et seq. where in our upward progression we will again show, for the present let this be admitted.
Of these things then we cannot point out another predicate, except according to opinion, but these may be predicated of others, nor can singulars 1 be predicated of others, but others of them.
It appears however that those which are interme­ diate, are capable in both ways (of demonstration), for they may be predicated of others, and others of them, and argu­ ments and speculations are almost all conversant with these.
Still it is requisite to assume the propositions about each thing thus:
—In the first place, the subject, (by hypothesis,) the definitions, and such peculiarities as exist of the thing;
next, whatever 2.
How to as­ sume propo­ sitions as to these, in order to inference.
things are consequent to the thing, and which the thing fol­ lows ;
2 lastly, such as cannot be in it;
those however which it cannot be in are not to be assumed, because of the conversion of the negative.
We must also distinguish in the consequents what things belong to "what a thing is," what are predicated as properties,3 and what as accidents;
also of these, those which are (predicated) according to opinion, and those, according to truth;
for the greater number any one has of these, the quicker will he light upon a conclusion, and the more true they are, the more will he de-

monstrate.
We must too select not those which are conse­ quent to a certain one, but those which follow the whole thing, e. g. not what follows a certain man, but what follows every man, for a syllogism consists of universal propositions.
If therefore a proposition is indefinite, it is doubtful whether it is universal, but when it is definite, this is manifest.
So also we must select those things the whole of which a thing follows, for the reason given above, but the whole consequent itself need not be assumed to follow;
I say for instance, (it must not be assumed) that every " animal " is consequent to " man," or every science to music, but only that they are simply conse­ quent, as we set forth,4 for the other is useless and impossible,5 as that every man" is "every animal," or that justice is every thing good."
To whatever (subject) a consequent is attached, the sign " every " is added;
when however the sub- ject is comprehended by a certain thing,1 the consequent-.;
of which we must assume, those which follow or which do not follow the universal, we are not to select in these-for they were assumed in those, since whatever are consequent to " animal," are also consequent to “ man," and as to whatever 2. ὶδιο to be as­ sumed.
Vide Aldrich and Hill.
things are not absolutely present with in like man­ ner;
but the properties of each thing must be taken, for there are certain properties in species not common to genus, since it is necessary that certain properties should be in different species.
Nor are we to select those in regard to the universal, which the thing com­ prehended follows, as those which “ man " follows ought not to be assumed to " animal," for it is necessary if animal fol­ lows man that it follows all these,2 but these more properly belong to the selection of the antecedents of " man."
3
We must also assume those which are generally consequent and antece­ dent, for of general problems the syllogism also is from propo­ sitions, all or some of which are general, as the conclusion of each syllogism resembles its principles.
Lastly, we are not to select things consequent to all, since there will not be composed a syllogism from them, on account of a reason which will ap­ pear from what follows.
1.
What should be the inspec­ tion of terms that an uni­ versal or parti­ cular affirm­ ative or nega­ tive may be de­ monstrated.
THOSE therefore who desire to confirm any thing of a certain universal, should look to the subject matter of what is confirmed, in respect of which it happens to be predicated ;
but of whatever ought to be predicated, of this, he should examine the consequents;
for if one of these happens to be the same, one must necessarily be in the other.
But if (it is to be proved) that a thing is not present universally, but particularly, he must examine those which each follows, 4 for if any of these is the same, to be particularly present is necessary ;
but when the presence with nothing is necessary, 1 as to what it need not be present with,2 we must look to those which cannot be present with it ;
3 or on the contrary, (as regards that) with which.
it is necessary not to be present, we must look to those which cannot be with it, but as to what ought not to be present, to the consequents.
For whichever of these are identical, it will happen that the one is in no other, since sometimes a syllogism arises in the first and at other times in the middle figure.
If however the particular non-inesse (is to be proved), that with which it ought not to be present, and those which it follows, are to be looked to ;
but of that which ought not to be present, those must be considered, which it is impossible can be in it, for if any of these be identical the particular non-inesse is necessary.
What has been said how­ ever will perhaps be more clear thus.
Let the consequents to A be B, but let those to which it is consequent be C;
those again which cannot be in it, D;
again, let the things present with E be F, and those to which it is consequent, G;
lastly, those which cannot be in it, H.
Now if a certain C and a certain F are identical, it is necessary that A should be with every E, for F is present with every E, and A with every C, so that A is with every E;
but if C and G are identical, A must necessarily be with a certain E, for A follows every C, and E every G.
If however F and D are identical, A will be with no E from a pro-syllogism,5 for since a negative is convertible and F is identical with D, A will be with no F, but F is with every E ;
again, if B and H are the same, A will be with no E, for B is with every A, but with no E, for it was the same as H, and H was with no E.
If D and G are identical, A will not be with a certain E, for A will not be with G, since it is not present with D, but G is under E, so that neither will it be with a certain E.
Moreover if B is identical with G there will be an inverse syllogism, for G will be with every A, (since B is with A,) and E with B (for B is the same as G);
still it is not necessary that A should be with every E, but it is neces- sary that it be with a certain E, because an universal predi­ cation may be converted into a particular one.
Wherefore we must evidently regard what ha­ been mentioned as to each part of every problem,' since all syllogisms are from these;
but in conse­ quents, and the antecedents of each thing, we must look to first elements, and to those which are for the most part universal, as in the case of E we must look more to K F than only to F,2 but in the case of A more to K C than to C only.
For if A is present with K C it is also present with F and with E,3 but if it is not consequent to this, yet it may be consequent to F;
in like manner we must examine those which the thing itself is consequent to, for if it follows the primary, it also does those which are included under them, and if it does not follow these, yet it may those which are arranged under them.
4Speculation then, plainly, consists of three terms and two 3.
Speculation consistsof three terms and two propositions.
propositions, and all syllogisms are through the above-mentioned figures;
for A is shown present with every E, when of C and F something iden­ tical may be assumed.
Now this will be the mid­ dle term,5 and A and E the extremes, and there is the first figure, but (presence with) a certain thing is shown when C and G are assumed identical, and this is the last figure, for G becomes the middle.
Again, (presence with) none, when D and F are identical, but thus also the first figure and the middle are produced $ the first, because A is with no F, (since a negative is converted,) but F is with every E ;
and the middle because D is with no A, but with every E.
Not to be present also with a certain one, (is shown) when D and G are the same, and this is the last figure, for A will be with no G, and E with every G.
Wherefore all syllogisms are evidently through the above-named figures, and we must not select those which are consequent to all, because no syllogism arises from them;
as, in short, we cannot construct from con- sequents, nor deduce a negative through an universal conse­ quent, for it must be in one, and not in the other.
Tl.at other modes of speculation2 also, as regards selection, are useless for the construction of syllogism is apparent;
for instance, if the consequents to each are identical, or if those which A (the predicate) follows, and which can­ not be with E (the subject), or again those which cannot concur to be with either, for no syllogism arises through these.
If then the consequents 4. Other modes than the first useless, as re­ gards selection of the middle.
are identical, as B and F, the middle figure is produced, having both premises affirmative ;
but if those which A follows, and which cannot be with E, as C and H, there will be the first figure having the minor premise negative ;
again, if those are identical which cannot be with either, as D and H,3 both pro­ positions will be negative, either in the first or in the middle figure :
thus, however, there will by no means be a syllogism.
We see moreover that we must assume in spe­ culation things identical, and not what are different, or contrary;
first, because our inspection is for the sake of the middle, and we must take as a middle, not what is different, but what is identical.
Next, in whatever a syllogism happens to be pro- 5.
We must select in inves­ tigation, not that wherein the terms differ, but in which they agree.
duced, from the assumption of contraries, or of those things which cannot be with the same, all are reduced to the before- named modes, as if B and F are contraries, or cannot be with the same thing;
if these are assumed there will be a syllo­ gism that A is with no E :
this however does not result from them, but from the above-named mode;
for B is with every A, and with no E, so that B must necessarily be identical with a certain H. Again, if B and G do not concur to be with the same thing, (it will follow) that A will not be with a certain E, and so there will be the middle figure, for B is with every A, and with no G,l so that B must necessarily be identical with some H.
For the impossibility of B and G being in the same thing, does not differ from B being the same as a certain H, since every thing is assumed which can­ not be with E.From these observations, then, it is shown that no syllogism arises ;
but if B and F are contraries, B must necessarily be identical with a certain H, and a syllogism arises through these.
Nevertheless it occurs to persons thus inspecting, that they look to a different way than the necessary, from the identity of B and H escaping them.
1.
The same method to be observed for selecting a middle term in syllogisms of " the impossi­ ble," as in the others.
SYLLOGISMS which lead to the impossible subsist in the same manner as ostensive, for these also arise through consequents, and those (antecedents) which each follows,2 and the inspection is the same in both, for what is ostensively demonstrated may be also syllogistically inferred per impossi­ bile, and through the same terms, and what is de­ monstrated per impossible, may be also proved ostensively, as that A is with no E.
For let it be supposed to be with a cer­ tain E, therefore since B is with every A, and A with a certain E, B also will be with a certain E, but it was present with none ;
again, it may be shown that A is with a certain E, for if A is with no E, but E is with every H, A will be with no H, but it was supposed to be with every H.
It will happen the same in other problems, for always and in all things demonstration per im­ possible will be from consequents, and from those which each follows.
In every problem also there is the same considera­ tion, whether a man wishes to syllogize ostensively, or to lead to the impossible, since both demonstrations are from the same terms, as for example, if A were shown to be with no E, because B happens to be with a certain E, which is impossible, if it is as­ sumed that B is with no E, but with every A, it is evident that A will be with no E.
Again, if it is ostensively collected that A is with no E, to those who suppose that it is with a certain E, it may be shown per impossible to be with no E.
The like will also occur in other cases, for in all we must assume some common term different from the subject terms to which there will appertain a syllogism of the false, so that this proposition being converted,1 but the other remaining the same, there will be an ostensive syllogism through the same terms.
But an ostensive syllogism differs from that per impossibile, because in the ostensive both premises are laid down according to truth, 2 but in that 2.
Wherein the ostensive and per impossibile syllogisms differ.
which leads to the impossible one is laid down falsely.
3These things however will more fully appear by what fol­ lows, when we come to speak of the impossible, for the pre­ sent let so much be manifest to us, that both he who wishes to syllogize ostensively, and per impossibile, must observe these things.
In other syllogisms indeed which are hypo­ thetical, such as those which are according to transumption, or according to quality, the consideration will be in the sub­ ject terms, not in the original ones, but in those taken afterwards, but the mode of inspection will be the same;
but it is necessary also to consider, and distinguish, in how many ways hypothetical syllogisms arise.
3. The mode of investigation the same in hypothetical.
Each problem then is demonstrated thus, and some of them we may infer syllogistically after another method, for example, universals by an hypothetical inspection of particulars, for if C and H are the same, and if E is assumed to be with H alone, A will be with every E;
and again, if D and H are the same, and E is predicated of H alone, (it may be shown) that A is with no E.
Wherefore the inspection must clearly be in this way after the same manner both in the necessary and contin­ gent, for the consideration is the same, and the syllogism both of the contingent and the absolute will be through terms the same in order;
in the contingent however we may assume things which are not with, but which may be, for it has been shown that by these a contingent syllogism is produced, and the reasoning is similar in the case of the other predications.
From what has.
been said then it appears not only that it is 4.
Conclusion.
allowable for all syllogisms to be formed in this, but that they cannot be formed in any other way, for every syllogism has been shown to originate through some one of the before-named figures, and these may not be consti­ tuted through any other than the consequents and antecedents of a thing, for from these are the premises and assumption of the middle, so that it is not admissible that a syllogism should be produced through other things.
1.
The method of demonstra­ tion laid down previously, is applicable to all objects of phi­ losophical in­ quiry.
THE way then of proceeding in all (problems), both in philosophy and in every art and discipline, is the same, for we must collect about each of them those things which are with, and the subjects which they are with, and be provided with as many as possible of these, considering them also through three terms in one way subverting, but in another constructing according to truth (we reason) from those which are truly de­ scribed to be inherent, but as regards dialectic syllogisms (we must reason) from probable propositions.
Now the princi­ pies of universal syllogisms have been mentioned, how they subsist, and how we must investigate them, that we may not direct our attention to every thing which is said, nor to con­ structing and subverting the same things, nor both construct­ ing universally or particularly, nor subverting wholly or par­ tially, but look to things fewer and definite;
as to each however we must make a selection, as of good or of science.
The peculiar principles indeed in every science are many, hence it is the province of experience to deliver the principles of every thing, for instance, I say that astrological experience gives the principles of astrological science, for from phenomena being sufficiently assumed, astrological demonstrations 2.
Experience is to supply the principles of demonstration in every sci­ ence.
have thus been invented, so also is it in every other art and science.
Wherefore if things are assumed which exist in in­ dividuals, it is now our duty readily to exhibit demonstrations, for if as regards history nothing is omitted of what is truly present with things, we shall be able about every thing of which there is demonstration to discover and demonstrate this, and to make that clear which is naturally incapable of demon­ stration.
Universally then we have nearly shown how propositions ought to be selected, but we have discussed this accurately in the treatise on Dia­ lectic.
13.
The end of analytical in­ vestigation to elucidate sub­ jects naturally abstruse.
THAT the division through genera3 is but a cer­ tain small portion of the method specified, it is easy to perceive, for division is, as it were, a weak syllogism, since it begs what it ought to demonstrate, Διαίρεσις.
1. Division, its use and abuse in argument.
It is a species of weak syllo­ gism.
and always infers something of prior matter.
1
Now this has first escaped the notice of all those who use it, and they endeavour to show that demonstration about essence and the very nature of a thing is possible, so that they neither perceive that those who divide happen to syllogize, nor that it is possible in the manner we have said.
In demonstrations therefore, when it is requisite to infer ab­ solute presence, the middle term by which the syllogism is 2.
In demon­ stration of the absolute, the middle must be less, and not universal in re­ spect of the first extreme.
produced must always be less, and must not be universally predicated of the first extreme, but on the contrary, division takes the universal for the middle term.
For let animal be A, mortal B, im­ mortal C, and man of whom we ought to assume the definition D, every animal then comprehends either mortal or immortal, but this is that the whole of what­ ever may be A is either B or C.
Again, he who divides man, admits that he is animal, so that he assumes A to be predicated of D, hence the syllogism is that every D is either B or C, wherefore it is necessary for man to be either mortal or immortal, yet it is not necessary that animal should be mortal, but this is desired to be granted, which was the very 4 Example (1.) thing which ought to have been syllogistically in­ ferred.*
Again, taking A for mortal animal, B for pedestrian, C without feet, and D for man, in the same manner it assumes A to be either with B or C, for every mortal animal is either pedestrian or without feet, and that A is pre­ dicated of D, for it has assumed that man is a mortal animal, so that it is necessary that man should be either a pedestrian animal or without feet, but that he is pedestrian is not neces­ sary, but they assume it, and this again is what they ought to have proved.*
After this manner * Example (2.) it always happens to those who divide, namely, that they as­ sume an universal middle, and what they ought to show, and the differences as extremes.
In the last place, they assert nothing clearly, as that it is necessary that this be a man, or that the † question necessarily is whatever it may be, but they pursue every other way, not appre­ hending the available supplies.
It is clear how­ ever, that by this method we can neither subvert nor syllogistically infer any thing of accident or property or genus, or of those things of which we are a priori ignorant as to how they subsist, as t TO ξητου̃ με­ νον. (Vide supra.)
3. Division not suitable for re­ futation, ncr for various kinds of ques­ tion.
whether the diameter of a square be incommensurable, for if it assumes every length to be either commensurable or incom­ mensurable, but the diameter of a square is a length, it will infer that the diameter is either incommensurable or com­ mensurable, and if it assumes that it is incommensurate, it will assume what it ought to prove, wherefore that we cannot show, for this is the way, and by this we cannot do it;
let however the incommensurable or commensurable be A, length B, and diameter C.‡
It is clear then that this mode of inquiry does not suit every speculation, ‡ Example (3.) neither is useful in those to which it especially appears ap­ propriate, wherefore from what sources, and how demonstra­ tions arise, and what we must regard in every problem, appear from what has been said.
How then we may reduce syllogisms to the above- named figures must next be told, for this is the remainder of the speculation, since if we have noticed the production of syllogisms, and have the power of inventing them, if moreover we analyze them when formed into the before-named figures, 1. Method of reducing every syllogism to one of the three figures to be considered.
(Compare ch. 28.) our original design will have been completed.
At the same time, what has before been said will happen to be confirmed, and be more evident that they are thus from what shall now be said, for every truth must necessarily agree with itself in every respect.
Rule 1st.
Propositions to be investigated as to quantity, &c.
First then we must endeavour to select the two propositions of a syllogism, for it is easier to di­ vide into greater than into less parts,1 and com­ posites are greater than the things of which they are composed;
next we must consider whether it is in a whole or in a part, and if both propositions should not be assumed, oneself placing one of them.
For those who propose the uni­ versal2 do not receive the other which is contained in it, neither when they write, nor when they interrogate, or pro­ pose these,4 but omit those5 by which these are concluded, 2nd rule.
Examine their superfluities and deficiencies as to the proper construction of syllogism.
and question other things to no purpose.
There­ fore we must consider whether any thing super­ fluous has been assumed, and any thing necessary omitted, and one thing is to be laid down, and another to be removed, until we arrive at two propositions, for without these we cannot reduce the sentences which are thus the subjects of question.
Now in some it is easy to see what is deficient, but others escape us, and seem to be syllogisms,6 because something necessarily happens from the things laid down, as if it should be assumed that essence not being subverted, essence is not subverted,?
but those things being subverted, of which a thing consists, what is composed of these is subverted also;
for from these positions it is necessary that a part of essence should be essence, yet this is not concluded through the assumptions, but the propositions are wanting.
Again, if because man ex­ ists, it is necessary that animal should be, and animal exist­ ing, that there should be essence;
then, because man exists, essence must necessarily be;
but this is not yet syllogistically inferred,1 for the proposi­ tions do not subsist as we have said they should ;
2 3rd rule.
Consider the reality of infer ence.
but we are deceived in such, because something necessary happens from the things laid down, and because also a syllo­ gism is something necessary.
The necessary, however, is more extensive than the syllogism, for every syllogism is ne­ cessary, but not every thing necessary is a syllogism;
so that if any thing occurs from certain positions, we must not imme­ diately endeavour to reduce, but first assume two propositions, then we must divide them into terms, in this manner, that term we must place as the middle which is said to be in both propositions, for the middle must necessarily exist in both, in all the figures.
If then the middle predicates, and is predicated of, or if it indeed predicates, but another thing is denied of it, there will be the first figure, but if it predicates, and is denied by something, there will be the middle figure, and if other things are predicated of it, and one thing is 4th rule.
Ascertain the figure to which properly the problem be­ longs, by the middle.
denied, but another is predicated, there will be the last figure;
thus the middle subsists in each figure.
In a similar manner also, if the propositions should not be universal, for the deter­ mination of the middle is the same,3 wherefore it is evident, that in discourse, where the same thing is not asserted more than once, a syllogism does not subsist, since the middle is not assumed.
As, however, we know what kind of problem is deduced in each figure,4 in what the universal, and in what the particular, it is clear that we must not regard all the figures, but that one which is appropriate to each problem, and whatever things are deduced in many figures, we may ascertain the figure of by the position of the middle.
1.
Cause of de­ ception about syllogisms— our inattention to the relative quantity of propositions.
IT frequently happens then, that we are deceived about syllogisms, on account of the necessary (conclusion), as we have before observed, and some­ times by the resemblance1 in the position of the terms, which ought not to have escaped us.
Thus if A is predicated of B, and B of C, there would appear a syllogism from such terms, yet neither is any thing necessary produced, nor a syllogism.
For let A be that which always is;
B, Aristomenes the object of intellect;
and C, Aristomenes;
it is true then that A is with B, for Aristomenes is always the object of intellect;
but B is also with C, for Aristo­ menes is Aristomenes the object of intellect, but A is not with C, for Aristomenes is corruptible, neither would a syllogism be formed from terms thus placed, but the universal proposi­ tion 2 A B must be assumed, but this is false, to think that every Aristomenes who is the object of intellect always exists, when Aristomenes is corruptible.
Again, let C be Miccalus, B Miccalus the musician, A to die to-morrow;
B therefore is truly predicated of C, since Miccalus is Miccalus the musician, and A is truly predicated of B, for Miccalus the musician may die to-morrow, but A is falsely predicated of C.
This case therefore is the same with the preceding, for it is not uni­ versally true that Miccalus the musician will die to-morrow, and if this is not assumed, there would be no syllogism.
4
This deception arises therefore from a small (matter), since we concede, as if there were no difference between saying that this thing is present with that, and this present with every individual of that.
DECEPTION will frequently occur from the terms of the proposition being improperly expounded,2 as if A should be health, B disease, and C man, for it is true to say that A cannot be with any B, 1.
Nature of do.
ception shown as arising from terms inaccu­ rately set out.
for health is with no disease, and again that Bis with every C, for every man is susceptible of disease, whence it would appear to result that health can be with no man.
Now the reason of this is, that the terms are not rightly set out in expression, since those words which are significant of habits being changed, there will not be a syllogism, as if the word “ well" were taken instead of "health," and the word "ill" instead of "dis­ ease," since it is not true to say, that to be well cannot be pre­ sent with him that is ill.
Now this not being assumed, there is no syllogism except of the contingent,3 which indeed is not impossible, for health may happen to be with no man.
Again, in the middle figure there will likewise be a falsity, for health happens to be with no disease, but may happen to be with every man, so that disease shall be with no man.
4
In the third figure however falsity occurs by the contingent, for it is possible that health and disease, science and ignorance, in short, contraries, shall be with the same individual, but it is impossible that they should be present with each other:
this, however, differs from the preceding observations,* since when many things happen to be present with the same * Vide ch. 20.
individual they also happen to be so with each other.
Evidently then in all these cases deception arises from the setting forth of the terms, as if those are changed which relate to the habits, there is no falsity, and it is therefore apparent that in such propositions, what relates to hat it must always be exchanged and placed for a term instead of habit.
21.
One word cannot always be used for some terms, in­ asmuch as they are sentences.
IT is not always necessary to seek to expound the terms by a name,3 since there will oftentimes be sentences to which no name is attached, wherefore it is difficult to reduce syllogisms of this kind, but we shall sometimes happen to be deceived by such a search, for example, because a syllogism is of things im­ mediate.
4
For let A5 be two right angles, B a triangle, C an isosceles triangle.
A then is with C through B, but no longer with B through any thing else, for a triangle has of itself two right angles, so that there will not be a middle of the propo­ sition A B,6 which is demonstrable.
The middle then must clearly not thus be always assumed, as if it were a particular definite thing,7 but sometimes a sentence, which happens to be the case in the instance adduced.
1.
For the con­ struction of a syllogism, it is not always re­ quisite that one term should beFOR the first to be in the middle, and the latter in the extreme, it is unnecessary to assume as if they were always predicated of each other, or in like manner,9 the first of the middle, and this in the last, and also likewise in the case of non- inesse.
Still in so many ways as to be is predi­ cated, and any thing is truly asserted, it is requi­ site to consider that we signify the inesse, as that of contraries there is one science.
For let A be, there is one science, and B, things predicated of the other " casu recto."
Since either major or minor premise, or both, may have an oblique case.
contrary to each other, A then is present with B, not as if contraries are one science,1 but because it is true in respect of them, to say that there is one science of them.
It sometimes occurs indeed, that the first is predicated of the middle, but the middle not of the third, as if wisdom is science, but wisdom is of2 good, the conclusion is that science is of good:
hence good is not wisdom, but wisdom is science.
Some­ times, again, the middle is predicated of the third, but the first not of the middle, e. g. if there is a science of every quality or contrary, but good is a contrary and a quality, the con­ clusion then is, that there is a science of good, yet neither good, nor quality, nor contrary is science, but good is these.
3
Sometimes, again, neither the first is predicated of the middle, nor this of the third, the first indeed being sometimes predi­ cated of the third, and sometimes not,4 for instance, of whatever there is science, there is genus, but there is science of good, the conclusion is that there is a genus of good, yet bone of these is predicated of any.
If, nevertheless, of what there is science, this is genus, but there is a science of good, the con­ clusion is that good is genus, hence the first is predicated of the extreme, but there is no predication of each other.
5
In the case of the non-inesse there must be the same manner of assumption, for this thing not being present with this, does not always signify 2.
Method the same with no, gativea.
that this is not this, but sometimes that this is not of this, or that this is not with this, as there is not a motion of motion or generation of generation, but there is (a motion and genera­ tion) of pleasure:
pleasure therefore is not generation.
Again, there is of laughter a sign, but there is not a sign of a sign, so that laughter is not a sign, and similarly in other cases, wherein the problem is subverted from the genus being in some way referred to it.
1
Moreover, occasion is not oppor­ tune time, for to the divinity there is occasion, but not oppor­ tune time, because there is nothing useful to divinity,2 we must take as terms, occasion, opportune time, and divinity, 3. Method of assuming pro­ positions and terms.
but the proposition must be assumed according to the case of the noun, since, in short, we assert this universally, that we must always place the terms according to the appellations of the nouns, e. g. man, or good, or contraries, not of man, nor of good, nor of contraries, but we must take propositions according to the cases of each word, since they, are either to this as the equal, or of this as the double, or this thing as striking, or seeing, or this one as man, animal, or if the noun falls in any other way, ac­ cording to the proposition.
1.
For true and absolute predi­ cation we must accept the se­ veral varieties of categorical division.
FOR this thing to be with that, and for one thing to be truly predicated of another, must be assumed in as many wavs as the categories are divided ;
the latter must also be taken either in a certain re­ spect,3 or simply, moreover either as simple 4 or connected,5 in a similar manner also with regard to the non-inesse ;
these however must be better considered and defined.
WHATEVER is reiterated*1 in propositions must be annexed to the major and not to the middle term ;
I mean for instance, if there should be a * ἔπαναδιπλου­ μενον.
syllogism, that there is a science of justice because it is good," the expression " because it is good," or “ in that it is good," must be joined to the major.
For let A be "science, that it is good ;
“ B, “good ;
” and C, "justice ;
” A then is truly predicated of B, since of good there is science that it is good :
1. Whatever is reiterated must be annex­ ed to the major, not to the mid­ dle term.
but B is also true of C ;
for justice is what is good, thus therefore the solution is made.†
But if, " that it is good " be added to B,2 it will not be true ;
for t Example (1.)
A will indeed be truly predicated of B, but it will not be true that B is predicated of C, since to predicate of justice, good that it is good, is false, and not intelligible.
So also it may be shown that the healthy is an object of science in that it is good, or that hircocervus is an object of opinion, quoad its nonentity,3 or that man is corruptible, so far as he is sensible, for in all super-predications, we must annex the repetition to the (major) term.
ἔπικατηγορου̃­ μενα.2.
The terms net the same as to assump­ tion whether the inference is simple or with a certain quali­ fication.
The position of the terms is nevertheless not the same when a thing is syllogistically inferred simply, and when this particular thing, or in a certain respect, or in a certain way.
For instance, I mean, as when good is shown to be an object of science, and when it is shown to be so because it is good;
but if it is shown to be an object of science simply, we * Example (2.) must take " being as the middle term ;
* if (it is proved that it may be scientifically known) to be good, a certain being (must be taken as the middle), For let A be " science, that it is a certain being," B “ a certain being," and C " good ;
" to predicate then A of B is true, for there is science of a certain being, that it is a certain being ;
but B is also predicated of C, because C is a cer­ t i. o. good.
tain being ;
T therefore A will be predicated of C, hence there will be science of good that it is good, for the expression “ a certain being" is the sign of peculiar or proper essence.
If, on the other hand, “ being " is set as the middle, and being simply and not a certain being is added to the extreme, there will not be a syllogism that there is a science of good, that it is good, but that it is being :
for ex­ t Example (3.) ample, let A be science that it is being;
B, being ;
and C, good.
t
In such syllogisms then as are from a party we must clearly take the terms after this manner.
WE must also exchange those which have the same import ;
nouns for nouns, and sentences for sentences, and a noun and a sentence,2 and always take the noun for the sentence, for thus the exposition of the terms will be easier.
For example, 1. In syllo­ gistic analysis terminal sim­ plicity and per­ spicuity to be studied.
if there is no difference in saying that what is supposed is not the genus of what is opined, or that what is opined is not any thing which may be supposed, (for the signification is the same,) in­ stead of the sentence already expressed we must take what may be supposed and what may be opined, as terms.
SINCE however it is not the same, for pleasure to be good, and for pleasure to be the good, we must not set the terms alike ;
but if there is a syllogism that pleasure is the good, the good (must be taken 1.

as a term) if that it is good, good (must be taken), and so of the rest.
IT is neither in fact nor in word the same thing to assert that A is present with every individual with which B is present, and to say that A is present with every individual of what B is pre­ sent with, since there is nothing to prevent B from being with C, yet not with every C.1
For instance, let B be beautiful, but C white, if then beautiful is with something white, it is true to say that beauty is present with what is white, yet not perhaps with every thing white.
If then A is with B, but not with every thing of which I.
The expres­ sion καθ’οὑ το B κατὰ παντὸς TO A λεγεσθαι, though not per se Identical with καθ’ οὕ παντὸςΤΟ B κατὰ του̃του̃ παντὸςκαὶ TO A, is equivalent to A being pre­ dicated of every thing of which B is pre­ dicated.
B is predicated, neither if B is present with every C, nor if it is alone present, it is necessary that A should not only not be present with every C, but that it should not be present (at all), but if that of which B is truly predicated, with every individual of this A is present, it will happen that A will be predicated of every individual of which B is predicated of every individual.
But if A is predicated of that of which B is universally predicated, there is nothing to prevent B from being present with C with not every or with no individual of which A is present, therefore in (three terms it is evident that) the assertion that A is predicated of every individual of which B is predicated, signifies that of whatever B is predi- cated of all these A is predicated also, and if B is predicated of every, A will also thus be predicated, but if it is not predicated of every individual it is not necessary that A should be predicated of every individual.
Still we need not imagine that any absurdity will occur from this exposition, for we do not use the expression that this is a particular definite thing,1 but as a geometrician says that this is a foot in length, is a straight line, and is without breadth though it is not so, he does not however so use them, as if he inferred 2 from these.

as a whole to a part, and something else in refer­ ence to this as a part to a whole, from nothing of these can a demonstrator demonstrate, where­ fore neither is there a syllogism, but we use exposition as we do sense 3 when we address a learner, since we do not (use it) so as if it were impossible to be demonstrated without these, as (we use propositions) from which a syllogism is con­ structed.
1.
The conclu­ sion an evi­ dence in what figure the inquiry is to be made.
LET us not forget that all conclusions in the same syllogism are not produced by one figure, but one through this figure, and another through that, so that clearly we must make the resolutions in the same manner, but since not every problem is proved in every 5 figure, but arranged in each, it is evident from the conclusion in what figure the inquiry must be made.
6WITH regard, however, to arguments against de­ finition, and by which a particular thing in the definition is attacked, that term must be laid down which is attacked, and not the whole de­ finition, for it will result that we shall be less disturbed by prolixity, e. g. if we are to show 1.
For brevity's sake the thing impugned in the definition, and not the whole defini­ tion itself, is to be laid down.
that water is humid potable, we must place potable and water as terms.
1WE must not endeavour, moreover, to reduce hy­ pothetical syllogisms, for we cannot reduce them, from the things laid down,2 since they are not proved syllogistically, but are all of them admitted 1.

some, for the same thing will be wholesome and unwholesome at the same time-here it will be shown that there is not one power of all contraries, but that is not a science, has not been shown.
We must yet acknowledge that there is, not however by syllogism, but by hypothesis, wherefore we cannot reduce this, but that, we may, viz.
that there is not one power, for this perhaps was a syllogism, but that an hy­ pothesis.

They differ nevertheless from the before-named,1 because we must in them indeed have admitted some thing previously, if we are about to consent, as if, for example, one power of contraries should have been shown, and that there was the same science of them, now here they admit, what they had not allowed previously on account of the evident falsity, as if the diameter of a square having been admitted commensurable with the side, odd things should be equal to even.
3.
Further con­ sideration of hypothetical deferred.
Many others also are concluded from hypothe­ sis, which it is requisite to consider, and clearly explain;
what then are the differences of these, and in how many ways an hypothetical syllogism is produced, we will show hereafter;
2 at present, let only so much be evident to us, that we cannot resolve such syllogisms into figures;
for what reason we have shown.* Anal. i. 4 and 26;
Topics, i. 4 and 11.
As many problems* as are demonstrated in many figures, if they are proved in one syllogism, may be referred3 to another, e. g. a negative in the first may be referred to the second, and one in the middle to the first, still not all, but some only.
4
This will appear 1.
Whatever syllogisms are proved in many figures, may be reduced from one figure to another-case of universal and particular in the first and second figures.
from the following :
if A is with no B, but B with every C, A is with no C, thus the first figure arises ;
but if the negative is converted, there will be the middle, for B will be with no A, and with every C.
In the same manner, if the syllo­ gism be not universal, but particular, as if A is with no B, but B is with a certain C, for the negative being converted there will be the middle figure.
Of syllogisms, however, in the middle figure, the universal will be reduced to the first, but only one of the particular,1 for let A be with no B, but with every C, then by conversion of the negative there will be the first figure, since B will be with no A, 2.
Universals in the second are reducible to the first, but only one par­ ticular.
but A with every C.
Now if the affirmative be added to B, and the negative to C, we must take C as the first term, since this is with no A, but A is with every B, wherefore C is with no B, neither will B be with any C, for the negative is converted.
If however the syllogism be particular, when the negative is added to the major extreme, it will be reduced to the first figure, as if A is with no B, but with a certain C, for by con­ version of the negative there will be the first figure, since B is with no A, but A with a certain C.
When however the affirma­ tive (is joined to the greater extreme), it will not be resolved, as if A is with every B, but not with every C, for the proposi­ tion A B does not admit conversion,2 nor if it were made would there be a syllogism.
Again, not all in the third figure will be resolv­ able into the first,3 but all in the first4 will be into the third, for let A be with every B, but B with a certain C, since then a particular affirmative is convertible, C will be with a certain B, but A was with every B, so that there is the third figure.
Also 3. Of those in the third figure, one only, when the negative is not universal, is not reducible to the first.
if the syllogism be negative, there will be the same result, for the particular affirmative is convertible, wherefore A will be with no B, but with a certain C.
Of the syllogisms in the last figure, one alone is not resolvable into the first,5 when the negative is not placed universal, all the rest however are re­ solved.
For let A and B be predicated of every C, C there­ fore is convertible partially to each extreme, wherefore it is present with a certain B, so that there will be the first figure, if A is with every C, but C with a certain B.
And if A is with every C, but B with a certain C, the reasoning is the same, for B reciprocates with C.
But if B is with every C, and A with a certain C, B must be taken as the first term, for B is with every C, but C with a certain A, so that B is with a certain A;
since however the particular is convertible, A will also be with a certain B.
If the syllogism be negative, when the terms are universal, we must assume in like manner, for let B be with every C, but A with no C, wherefore C will be with a certain B, but A with no C, so that C will be the middle term.
Likewise, if the negative is universal, but the affirmative particular, for A will be with no C, but C with a certain B ;
if however the * ἀνάλυσις.
negative be taken as particular, there will not be a resolution,* e. g. if B is with every C, but A not with a certain C, for by conversion of the proposition B C, both propositions will be partial.
4.
The conver­ sion of the minor premise necessary for reduction.
It is clear then, that in order mutually to con­ vert these figures,l the minor premise must be converted in either figure, for this being trans­ posed a transition 2 is effected;
of syllogisms in the middle figure,3 one is resolved,4 and the other is not5 resolved into the third, for when the universal is negative there is a resolution, for if A is with no B, but with a certain C, both similarly reciprocate with A, wherefore B is with no A, but C with a certain A, the middle then is A.
When however A is with every B, and is not with a certain C, there will not be reso­ lution, since neither proposition after conversion is universal.
Syllogisms also of the third figure may be resolved into the middle, when the negative is universal, as if A is with no C, but B is with some or with every C, for C will be with no A, but will be with a certain B, but if the negative be particular, there will not be a resolution, since a particular negative does not admit conversion.
5.
Those syllo­ gisms not mu­ tually reduci­ ble into the other figures which are not into the first.
We see then that the same syllogisms6 are not resolved in these figures, which were not resolved into the first figures, and that when syllogisms are reduced to the first figure, these only are con­ cluded per impossibile.
How therefore we must reduce syllogisms, and that the figures are mutually resolvable, appears from what has been said.
THERE is some difference in the construction or subversion of a problem, whether we suppose the expressions “ not to be this particular thing," and “ to be not this particular thing," have the same, or different signification, e. g. " not to be white," 1. Difference in statement aris.
ing from “not to be " and " to be not,”—with the reason.
(Cf. Herm. 6.) and “ to be not white."
Now they do not signify the same thing, neither of the expression " to be white," is the nega­ tion "to be not white," but, "not to be white;
" and the reason of this is as follows.
The expression "he is able to walk," is similar to "he is able not to walk," the expression " it is white " to, " it is not white," and “he knows good," to " he knows what is not good."
For these, " he knows good," or " he has a knowledge of good," does not at all differ, nei­ ther “ he is able to walk," and "he has the power of walk­ ing ;
" wherefore also the opposites, " he is not able to walk," and “ he has not the power of walking," (do not differ from each other).
If then “ he has not the power of walking," signifies the same as "he has the power of not walking," these will be at one and the same time present with the same, for the same person is able to walk, and not to walk, and is cognizant of good, and of what is not good, but affirmation and negation being opposites, are not at the same time present with the same thing.
1
Since therefore it is not the same thing “ not to know good," and " to know what is not good," nei­ ther is it the same thing to be "not good and " not to be good," since of things having analogy,2 if the one is different the other also differs.
Neither is it the same to be " not equal," . and " not to be equal,” 3 for to the one, namely, " to that which is not equal," something is subjected, and this is the unequal, but to the other there is nothing subjected, wherefore “ not every thing is equal or unequal," but “ every thing is equal or not equal."
Besides this expression, " it is not white wood," and this, " not is white wood," are not present toge­ ther at the same time, for if it is “ wood not white," it will be wood ;
but "what is not white wood" is not of necessity “wood,” so that it is clear that of "it is good" the negation is not “it is not good."
If then of every one thing either the affirm­ ation or negation is true, if there is not negation, it is evident that there will in some way be affirmation, but of every affirm­ ation there is negation, and hence of this 1 the negation is, it, it is not not good."
They have this order indeed with respect 2. Order of af­ firmation and negation.
to each other:
let to be good be A, not to be good B, to be not good C under B, not to be not good D under A.
With every individual then either A or B will be present, and (each) with nothing which is the same and C or D with every individual,2 and with nothing which is the same, and with whatever C is present, B must necessarily be present with every individual, for if it is true to say that " a thing is not white," it is also true to say that “ not it is white," for a thing cannot at one and the same time be white and not white, or be wood not white and be white wood, so that unless there is affirmation, negation will be present.
—C however is not always (consequent) to B, for in short, what is not wood will not be white wood, on the contrary, with whatever A is present D also is present with * c. t A. every individual, for either C or D will be pre­ sent.
As however " to be not white" * and “ to be white," t cannot possibly co-subsist, D will be present, for of what is white we may truly say, that it is not not white, yet A is not predicated of every D, for, in short, we can­ not truly predicate A of what is not wood, namely, to assert that it is white wood, so that D will be true, and A will not be true, namely, that it is white wood.
It appears also, that A and C are present with nothing identical, though B and D may be present with the same.
Privatives also subsist similarly to this position with respect to attributes,1 for let equal be A, not equal B, unequal C, not unequal D.
In many things also, with some of which the same thing is present and not with others, the negative may be 3.

similarly true, that, “ not all things are white," or " that not each thing is white ;
” but, " that each thing is not white," or, "that all things are not white," is false.
So also of this affirmation, “ every animal is white," the negation is not, "every animal is not white," for both are false, but this, it not every animal is white."
Since however it is clear that " is not white," signifies something different from " not is white," and that one is affirmation and the other negation, it is also clear that there is not the same mode of demonstrating each, for example,2 " whatever is an animal is not white," or " happens not to be white;
" and that we may truly say, " it is not white," for this is " to be not white."
Still there is the same mode as to it is true to say it is white or not white, for both are demonstrated constructively * through the first figure, since the word “ true " is similarly arranged with " is," for of the assertion “ it is true to say it is white," the negation is not, “ it is true to say it is not white," but " it is not true to say it is white."
But if it is true to say, "whatever is a man is a3 musician, or is not a musician,” we must assume that " whatever is an animal is either a musician or is not a musician,”5 and it will be demonstrated, but that " whatever is a man is not a musician," is shown negatively † according to the three modes6 stated.
In short, when A and B are so, as that they cannot be simultaneously in the same thing, but one of them is necessarily present to every indi­ * κατασκευασ­ τικω̃ς, “ con­ structive," Averr. " con­ firmative," Buhle.

vidual, and again C and D likewise, but A follows C and does not reciprocate, D will also follow B, and will not reciprocate, and A and D may be with.
the same thing, but B and C cannot.
In the first place then, it appears from this that D is consequent to B, for since one of C D is necessarily present with every individual, but with what B is present C cannot be, because it introduces with itself A, but A and B cannot consist with the same, D is evidently a consequent.
Again, since C does not reciprocate with A, but C or D is present with every, it happens that A and D will be with the same thing, but B and C cannot, because A is consequent to C, for an impossibility results, 1 wherefore it appears plain that neither does B reciprocate with D, because it would hap­ pen that A is present together with D.26.
Fallacy arising from not assuming opposites pro­ perly.
Sometimes also it occurs that we are deceived by such an arrangement of terms, because of our not taking opposites rightly, one of which must necessarily be with every individual, as if A and B cannot be simultaneously with the same, but it is necessary that the one should be with what the other is not, and again C and D in like manner, but A is consequent to every C ;
for B will hap­ pen necessarily to be with that with which D is, which is false.
For let the negative of A B which is F be assumed, and again the negative of C D, and let it be H, it is necessary then, that either A or F should be with every individual, since either at­ firmation or negation must be present.
Again also, either C or H, for they are affirmation and negation, and A is by hy­ pothesis present with every thing with which C is, so that H will also be present with whatever F is.
Again, since of F B, one is with every individual, and so also one of H D, and H is consequent to F, B will also be consequent to D, for this we know.
If then A is consequent to C, B will also follow D, but this is false, since the sequence was the reverse in things so subsisting, for it is not perhaps necessary that either A or F should be with every individual, neither F nor B, for F is not the negative of A, since of " good" the negation is " not good," and “ it is not good" is not the same with " it is neither good nor not good."
It is the same also of C P sumed negatives are two.IN how many figures, through what kind and number of propositions, also when and how a syl­ logism is produced, we have therefore now ex­ plained;

regard, as well as how we should investigate a proposed sub­ ject after every method;
further, in what manner we should assume the principles of each question.
Since, however, some syllogisms are universal, but others particular, all the universal always con­ clude a greater number of things, yet of the par-

ticular, those which are affirmative many things, but the negative one conclusion only.
For other propositions are con­ verted, but the negative is not converted, but the conclusion is something of somewhat;
hence other syllogisms conclude a majority of things, for example, if A is shown to be with every or with a certain B, B must also necessarily be with a certain A, and if A is shown to be with no B, B will also be with no A, and this is different from the former.
If however A is not with a cer­ tain B, B need not be not present with a certain A, for it possibly may be with every A.1
This then is the common cause of all syllogisms, both universal and par­ ticular ;
we may however speak differently of universals, for as to whatever things are under the middle, or under the conclusion, of all there 3.
Difference between uni­ versals of the first and those of the second figure.
will be the same syllogism, if some are placed in the middle, but others in the conclusion,2 as, if A B is a conclusion through C, it is necessary that A should be predicated of whatever is under B or C, for if D is in the whole of B, but B in the whole of A, D will also be in the whole of A.
Again, if E is in the whole of C, and C is in A, E will also be in the whole of A, and in like manner if the syllogism be negative;
but in the second figure it will be only possible to form a syllogism of that which is under the conclusion.
As, if A is with no B, but is with every C, the conclusion will be that B is with no C ;
if therefore D is under C, it is clear that B is not with it, but that it is not with things under A, does not appear by the syllogism, though it will not be with E, if it is under A.
But it has been shown by the syllogism that B is with no C, but it was as­ sumed without demonstration 1 that it is not with A, wherefore it does not result by the syllogisms that B is not with E. Nevertheless in particular syllogisms of things under the con­ clusion, there is no necessity incident, for a syllogism is not *(πρότασις.) major in let figure.

is assumed as particular, but there will be of all things under the middle, yet not by that syllogism, e. g. if A is with every B, but B with a certain C, there will be no syllogism of what is placed under C, but there will be of what is under B, yet not through the antecedent syllogism.
Similarly also in the case of the other figures, for there will be no conclusion of what is under the conclusion, but there will be of the other, yet not through that syllogism ;
in the same manner, as in universals, from an undemonstrated proposition, things under the middle were shown, wherefore either there will not be a conclusion there,3 or there will be in these also.
41. Material truth or falsity of propositions, is not shared by the conclu­ lion.
IT is therefore possible that the propositions may be true, through which a syllogism arises, also that they may be false, also that one may be true and the other false;
but the conclusion must of necessity be either true or false.
From true propositions then we cannot inter a falsity, but from false premises we may infer the truth, except that not the why,. but the mere that (is inferred), since there is not a syllogism of the why from false premises, and for what reason shall be told hereafter.
1
First then, that we cannot infer the false from true premises, appears from this:
if when A is, it is necessary that B should be, when B is not it is necessary that A is not, if therefore A is true, B is necessarily true, or the same thing (A) would at one and the same time be and not be,2 which is impossible.
Neither must it be thought, be­ cause one term, A, is taken, that from one certain * οὐ ὀιότι ἀλλ’ on, " non propter quid led quia.”— Averr. (Hill's Logic, p. 287.)
2. We may infer the true from false pre­ mises, but not the false from true premises.
Proof—(Vide Aldrich,general rules of syllo­ gism.) thing existing, it will happen that something will result from necessity, since this is not possible, for what results from necessity is the conclusion, and the fewest 1. things through which this arises are three terms, but two in­ tervals and propositions.
If then it is true that with whatever B is A also is, and that with whatever C is B is, it is necessary that with whatever C is A also is, and this cannot be false, for else the same thing would exist and not exist at the same time.
Wherefore A is laid down as one thing, the two propositions being co-assumed.
It is the same 2.
also in negatives, for we cannot show the false from what are true ;
but from false propositions we may collect the truth,3 either when both premises are false, or one only, and this not indifferently, but the minor, if it comprehend the whole false, but if the whole is not assumed to be false, the true may be collected from either.t
Now let A be with the whole of C, but with no B, nor B with C, t being as­ sumed false.
and this may happen to be the case, as animal is with no stone, nor stone present with any man, if then A is assumed present with every B, and B with every C, A will be with every C, * Example (1.)
so that from propositions both false, the conclusion will be true, since every man is an animal..
So also a negative conclusion (is attained), for neither A 8.
may be assumed, nor B present with any C, but let A be with every B, for example, as if, the same terms being taken, man was placed in the middle, for neither t Man. t Animal.
§ In the major. || In the minor. ¶ Example (2.) 4. animal nor man is with any stone, but animal is with every man.
Wherefore if with what † it fis present universally, it is assumed to be present with none,§ but with what it is not present, we assume that it is present with every individual, || from both these false premises, there will be a true con­ clusion.¶
The same may be shown if each pre­ mise is assumed partly false, but if only one is admitted false, if the major is wholly false, as A B, there will not be a true conclusion, but if B C, (the minor is wholly S. Instance of a false propo­ sition.
false,) there will be (a true conclusion).
Now I mean by a proposition wholly false that which is contrary (to the true), as if that was assumed pre­ sent with every, which is present with none, or that present with none, which is present with every.
For let A be with no B, but B with every C, if then we take the proposition B C as true, but the whole of A B as false, and that A is with every B, it is impossible for the conclusion to be true, for it was present with no C, since A was present with none of what B was present with, but B was with every C.* * Example (3.)In like manner also the conclusion will be false, if A is with every B, and B with every C, and 5. the proposition B C is assumed true, but A B wholly false, and that A is present with no individual with which B is, for A will be with every C, since with whatever B is, A also is, but B is with every C.
It is clear then, that, the major premise being assumed wholly false, whether it be affirmative or negative, but the other pre­ mise being true, there is not a true conclusion ;
if however the whole is not assumed false, there will be.
For if A is with every C, but with a cer­ tain B, and B is with every C ;

ness with every swan, if A is assumed present with every B, and B with every C, A will also be truly present with every C, since every swan is an animal.
tSo also if A B be negative, for A concurs with a certain B, but with no C, and B with every C, t Example (4.)
2. Negative. as animal with something white, but with no snow, and whiteness with all snow ;
if then A is assumed present with no B, but B with every C, A will be present with no C.
‡If however the proposition A B were assumed wholly true, but B C wholly false, there will be a true syllogism, 1 as nothing prevents A from being with every B and every C, and yet B with no C, as is the case with species of the same genus, which ‡ Example (5.)

but horse with no man ;
if therefore A is assumed pre- 1. Affirmative.
* Example (6.) sent with every B, and B with every C, the con­ clusion will be true, though the whole proposition B C is false.-
It will be the same, if the propo­ sition A B is negative.
For it will happen that A will be neither with any B, nor with any C, and that B is with no C, as genus to those species which are from another genus, for animal neither concurs with music nor with medicine, nor music with medicine:
if then A is assumed present with no t Example (7.)
B, but B with every C, the conclusion will be true.
Now if the proposition B C is not wholly but partially false, even thus the conclusion will be true.
For nothing prevents A from concurring with the whole of B, and the whole of C, and B with a certain C, as genus with species and difference, thus animal is with every man and with every pedestrian, but man concurs with something, and not with every thing pedestrian :
if then A is assumed pre- 1 Example (8.) sent with every B, and B with every C, A will also be present with every C,‡ which will be true.
The same will occur if the proposition A B be negative.
For A may happen to be neither with 2. Negative.
any B, nor with any C, yet B with a certain C, as genus with the species and difference which are from another genus.
Thus animal is neither present with any prudence nor with any thing contemplative, but prudence is with something contemplative ;
if then A is assumed present with no B, but B with every C, A will be with no C, which will be true.
*In particular syllogisms however, when the whole of the major premise is false, but the other true, the conclusion may be true ;
also when the major A B is partly false, but B C (the minor) wholly true ;
and when A B the major is true, but the particular false, also when both are false.
* Example (9.) 6. In particu­ lars with a ma­ jor false, but a minor true, there may be a true conclu­ sion.
For there is nothing to prevent A from concurring with no B, but with a certain C, and also to prevent B from being present with a certain C, as animal is with no snow, but is with something white, and snow with 1.

something white.
If then snow is taken as the middle, and animal as the first term, and if A is assumed present with the whole of B, but B with a certain C, the whole proposition A B will be false, but B C true, also the conclu­ sion will be true.
† t Example (10.)It will happen also the same, if the proposition A B is ne­ gative, since A may possibly be with the whole of B, and not with a certain C, but B may be with a certain C.

Moreover it is evident that from premises both false there will be a true conclusion, if A happens to be present with the whole of B and of C, but B to be not consequent to a certain C, for if A is assumed present with no B, but with a certain C, both propositions are false, but the conclusion will be true.
In like manner when the universal premise is affirmative, but the particular negative, since A may follow no B, but every C, and B may not be present with a certain C, as animal is consequent to no science, but to every man, but science to no man.
If then A is assumed present with the whole of B, and not conse­ * Example (13.) quent to a certain C, the premises will be false, but the conclusion will be true.

THERE will also be a conclusion from false pre­ mises in the last figure, as well when both are false and either partly false or one wholly true, but the other false, or when one is partly false, and the other wholly true, or vice versa, in fact in as many ways as it is possible to change the propositions.

Thus blackness consists with no swan, but animal with every swan, and animal is not present with every thing black.

Likewise, if one premise be assumed wholly false, but the other wholly true, for both A and B may follow every C, but A not be with a certain B, as animal and whiteness follow every swan, yet animal is not with every thing white.

So also if B C is false, but A C true, for there are the same terms for demonstration, black, swan, inanimate.

Hence if A and B are assumed present with every C, B C will be wholly true, but A C wholly false.
and the conclusion will be true.*
Similarly, again, if A C is assumed true, for the demonstration will be through the same terms.†
Again, if one is * Example (7.) t Example (8.) wholly true, but the other partly false, since B may be with every C, but A with a certain C, also A with a certain B, as biped is with every man, but beauty not with every man, and beauty with a certain biped.
If then A and B are assumed present with the whole of C, the proposition B C is wholly true, but A C partly false, the conclusion will also be true.‡
Likewise, if A C is assumed true, and B C partly false, for by transposition of the same terms, 1 there will be a demonstration.
§ Again, if I Example (9.)
8. § Example (10.) one is negative and the other affirmative, for since B may possibly be with the whole of C, but A with a certain C, when the terms are thus, A will not be with every B.
If B is as­ sumed present with the whole of C, but A with none, the negative is partly false, but the other wholly true, the con­ clusion will also be true.
Moreover, since it has been shown that A being present with no C, but B with a certain C, it is possible that A may not be with a certain B, it is clear that when A C is wholly true, but B C partly false, the conclusion may be true, for if A is assumed 9.
present with no C, but B with every C, A C is wholly true, but B C partly false.
Nevertheless, it appears that there will be alto­ gether a true conclusion by false premises, in the case also of particular syllogisms.
For the same terms must be taken, as when the premises were universal, namely, in affirmative propositions, af­ firmative terms, but in negative propositions, nega-

Also nega­ tives.
4. If the con­ clusion is frise there must be falsity in one or more of the premises-but this does not hold good vice versà.
Reason of this.
versally,1 as far as regards the setting out of t he terms;
2 the like also happens in negatives.
We see then that if the conclusion is false, those things from which the reasoning proceeds, must either all or some of them be false;
but when it (the conclusion) is true, that there is no necessity, either that a certain thing, or that all things, should be true;
but that it is possible, when nothing in the syllogism is true, the conclusion should, nevertheless, be true, yet not of necessity.
The reason of this however is, that when two things3 so sub­ sist with relation to each other, that the existence of the one necessarily follows from that of the other, if the one does not exist, neither will the other be,5 but if it6 exists that it is not necessary that the other7 should be.
If however the same thing8 exists, and does not exist, it is impossible that there should of necessity be the same (consequent);
9
I mean, as if A being white, B should necessarily be great, and A not be­ ing white, that B is necessarily great, for when this thing A being white, it is necessary that this thing B should be great, but B being great, C is not white, if A is white, it is neces­ sary that C should not be white.
Also when there are two things, 10 if one is,11 the other 12 must necessarily be, but this not existing, it is necessary that A. should not be, thus B not being great, it is impossible that A should be white.
* (Illud.) Buhle.
L e the first.
But if when A is not white, it is necessary that B should be great, it will necessarily happen that B not being great, B itself is great, which is impossible.
For if B is not great, A will not be necessarily white, and if A not being white, B should be great, it results, as through three (terms), that if B is not great, it is great.
t t Example (11.)THE demonstration of things in a circle, and from each other, is by the conclusion, and by taking one proposition converse in predication, to con­ clude the other, which we had taken in a former 1.

syllogism.
As if it were required to show that A is with every C, we should have proved it through B ;
2 again,3 if a person should show that A is with B, assuming A present with C, but C with B, and A with B;
first, on the contrary, he as­ sumed B present with C.
Or if it is necessary to demonstrate that B is with C,4 if he should have taken A (as predicated) of C, which was the conclusion,5 but B to be present with A, for it was first assumed6 conversely, that A was with B.
It is not however possible in any other manner to demonstrate them from each other, for whether another middle7 is taken, there will not be (a demonstration) in a circle, since nothing is assumed of the same,8 or whether something of these (is as­ sumed), it is necessary that one alone9 should (be taken), for 2.
A demon­ stration of this kind not truly made, except through con­ verted terms, and then by assumption " pro con­ cesso," only.
if both1 there will be the same conclusion, when we need another.
In those terms then which are not converted, a syllogism is produced from one undemonstrated proposition, for we cannot demon­ strate by this term, that the third is with the mid­ dle, or the middle with the first, but in those which are converted we may demonstrate all by each other, as if A B and C reciprocate;
for A C can be demonstrated by the middle,2 B;
again,3 A B (the major) through the conclusion, and through the proposition B C, (the minor) being converted ;
likewise 4 also B C the minor through *

the conclusion, and the proposition A B con­ verted.
We must however demonstrate the pro­ position C B,* and B
At for we use these alone undemonstrated, if then B is taken as present with every C,‡ and C with every A, there will be a syllogism of B in respect to A.§
Again, if C is assumed present with every A, and A with every B,|| it is necessary that C should be present with every B, in both 5 syllogisms indeed, the pro­ position C A is taken undemonstrated, for the others were demonstrated.
Wherefore if we should show If The 4th syllo­ gism, C B A. this, they will all have been shown by each other.
If then C is assumed present with every B,¶ and B with every A, both propositions are taken de­ monstrated, and C is necessarily present with A, hence it is clear that in convertible propositions alone, demonstrations may be formed in a circle, and through each other, but in others as we have said before,6 it occurs also in these 7 that we use the same thing demonstrated for the pur­ pose of a demonstration.
For C is demonstrated of B,* and B of A,t assuming C to be predicated of A,t but C is demonstrated of A § by these pro­ positions, || so that we use the conclusion I for de­ monstration.
In negative syllogisms a demonstration through each other is produced thus:
let B be with every C, but A present with no B, the conclusion that * The major of 4th. t

A is with no C.
If then it is again necessary to conclude that A is with no B, which we took before, A will be with no C, but C with every B, for thus the proposition becomes con­ verted.
But if it is necessary to conclude that B is with C, the proposition A B must no longer be similarly converted, for it is the same proposition,¶ that B ¶ Equipollent.
is with no A, and that A is with no B, but we must assume that B is present with every one of which A is present with none.
Let A be present with no C, which was the con­ clusion, but let B2 be assumed present with every of which A is present with none, therefore B must necessarily be present with every C, so that each of the assertions which are three becomes a conclusion, and this is to demonstrate in a circle, namely, assuming the conclusion and one premise converse to infer the others Now in particular syllogisms we cannot demonstrate universal pro­ position through others, but we can the particular, and that we cannot demonstrate universal is evi­ dent, for the universal is shown by universals, but the conclusion is not universal, and we must 4.

1. demonstrate from the conclusion, and from the other proposi­ tion.
Besides, there is no syllogism produced at all when the proposition is converted since both premises become particular.
But we can demonstrate a particular proposition, for let A be 2. demonstrated of a certain C through B, if then B is taken as present with every A, and the con­ clusion remains, B will be present with a certain C, for the * Example (I.) first figure is produced, and A will be the middle.*
Nevertheless if the syllogism is negative, we can­ not demonstrate the universal proposition for the reason ad­ duced before, but a particular one cannot be demonstrated, if A B is similarly converted as in universals, but we may show it by assumption, 1 as that A is not present with something, but that B is, since otherwise there is no syllogism from the particular proposition being negative.
1.
In uni­ versals of the second figure an affirmative proposition is not demon­ strated.
IN the second figure we cannot prove the affirm­ ative in this mode, but we may the negative;
the affirmative therefore is not demonstrated, because there are not both propositions affirmative, for the conclusion is negative, but the affirmative is demonstrated from propositions both affirmative, the negative however is thus demonstrated.
Let A be with every B, but with no C, the conclusion B is with no C, if then B is assumed present with every A, it is necessary that A should be present with no C, for there is the second figure, the middle is B.
But if A B be taken negative, and the other 2.

But if the 3.

But if the universal is negative, the proposition A C will not be de­ monstrated, A B being converted, for it will hap- 2.
pen either that both1 or that one proposition will be negative, so that there will not be a syllogism.
Still in the same man­ ner there will be a demonstration, as in the case of universals, if A is assumed present with a certain one, with which B is not present.
IN the third figure, when both propositions are assumed universal, we cannot demonstrate reci­ procally, for the universal is shown through uni­ versals, but the conclusion in this figure is always particular, so that it is clear that in short we can­ not demonstrate an universal proposition by this figure.
Still if one be universal and the other particular, there will be at one time and not at another (a reciprocal demonstration);
when then both propositions are taken affirmative, and the 1.
In this figure, when both proposi­ tions are uni­ versal there is no demonstra­ tion in a circle.
2. There will be demonstra­ tion where the minor is uni­ versal and the major particu­ lar.
universal belongs to the less extreme, there will be, but when to the other, there will not be.
For let A be with every C, but B with a certain (C), the conclusion 1.
A B, if then C is assumed present with every A, C has been shown to be with a certain B, but B has not been shown to be with a certain C.
But it is necessary if C is with a certain B, that B should be with a certain C, but it is not the same thing, for this to be with that, and that with this, but it mast be as­ sumed that if this is present with a certain that, that also is with a certain this, and from this assumption there is no longer a syllogism from the conclusion and the other proposition.
If 2. however B is with every C, but A with a certain C, it will be possible to demonstrate A C, when C is assumed present with every B, but A with a certain (B).
For if C is with every B, but A with a certain B, A must necessarily be with a certain C, the middle is B.
And when 3.
When the affirmative is universal there is demonstra­ tion of the par­ ticular nega­ tive.
4. Not when the negative is universal (ex­ ception).
one is affirmative, but the other negative, and the affirmative universal, the1 other will be demon­ strated ;
for let B be with every C, but A not be with a certain (C), the conclusion is, that A is not with a certain B.
If then C be assumed besides present with every B, A must necessarily not be with a certain C, the middle is B.
But when the negative is universal, the other is not demon­ strated, unless as in former cases, if it should be assumed that the other is present with some individual, of what this is present with none, as if A is with no C, but B with a certain C, the conclusion is, that A is not with a certain B.
If then C should be assumed present with some individual of that with every one of which A is not present, it is necessary that C should be with a certain B.
We cannot however in any other way, converting the universal proposition, demon­ strate the other, for there will by no means be a syllogism.
2
It appears then, that in the first figure there is a reciprocal demonstration effected through the third and through the first figure, for when the conclusion is affirmative, it is through the first, but when it is negative through the last,3 for it is assumed *

is present with none, the other t is present with every individual.
In the. middle figure however, the syllogism being uni- versal, (the demonstration) is through it" and through the first figure,.
and when it is particular, both through it and through the last.
2
In the third all are through it, but it is also clear that in the third and in the middle the syllogisms, which are not produced through them, either are not according to a circular demonstration, or are imperfect.
CONVERSION is by transposition of the conclusion to produce a syllogism, either that the major is not with the middle, or this (the middle) is not with the last (the minor term).

For it is necessary 1. Definition of conversion of syllogism (ἀντιστρεφειν).
when the conclusion is converted, and one proposition re­ mains, that the other should be subverted, for if this (pro­ position) will be, the conclusion will also be.

But there is a difference whether we convert the conclusion contradictorily or contrarily, for there is not the same syllogism, whichever way the conclusion is converted, and this will appear from what follows.
But I mean to be opposed (con- 2.

tradictorily) between, to every individual and not to every individual, and to a certain one and not to a certain one, and contrarily being present with every and being present with none, and with a certain one, not with a certain one.,, For let A be demonstrated of C, through 1. the middle B;
if then A is assumed present with no C, but with every B, B will be with no C, and if A is with no C, but B with every C, A will not be with every B, and not altogether with none, for the universal was not concluded through the last figure.
In a word, we cannot subvert universally the major premise by conversion, for it is always subverted through the third figure, but we must assume both propositions to the minor term, likewise also if the syllogism is negative.
For let A be shown through B to be present with no C, where­ fore if A is assumed present with every C,1 but with no B, B will be with no C, and if A and B are with every C, A will be with a certain B, but it was present with none.
22.
If however the conclusion is converted contra­ dictorily, the (other) syllogisms also will be con­ tradictory,8 and not universal, for one premise is particular, so that the conclusion will be particular.
For let the syllo­ gism be affirmative, and be thus converted, hence if A is not with every C, but with every B, B will not be with every C, and if A is not with every C, but B with every C, A will not * i. e. Celarent. + Universally.
be with every B. Likewise, if the syllogism be negative,.
for if A is with a certain C,4 but with no B, B will not be with a certain C, and not simply t with no C, and if A is with a certain C,5 and B with every C, as was assumed at first,6 A will be with a certain B.3.
In particu­ lars, of the first figure when the conclusion is converted con­ tradictorily both proposi­ tions are sub­ verted, if con­ trarily, neither.
‡ Darii.
In particular syllogisms, when the conclusion is converted contradictorily, both propositions arc sub­ verted, but when contrarily, neither of them;
for it no longer happens, as with universals, that through failure of the conclusion 7 by conversion, a subver­ sion is produced, since neither can we subvert it at all.
For let A be demonstrated of a certain C,‡ if therefore A is assumed present with no C,9 but B with a certain C, A will not be with a certain B,10 and if A is with no C, but with every B, B will be with no C,1 so that both propositions are subverted.
If however the con­ clusion be converted contrarily, neither (is sub- 2. verted), for if A is not with a certain C, but with every B, B will not be with a certain C, but the original proposition is not yet subverted,* for it may be present with a certain one, and not present with a certain one.
Of the universal proposition A B there is not any * Viz. the mi­ nor premise of Darii.
syllogism at all,2 for if A is not with a certain C, but is with a certain B, neither premise is universal.
So also if the syllo­ gism be negative, for if A should be assumed present with every C, both are subverted, but if with a certain C, neither;
the demonstration however is the same.
IN the second figure we cannot subvert the major premise contrarily, whichever way the conversion is made, since the conclusion will always be in the third figure, but there was not in this figure an universal syllogism.
The other proposition in­ deed we shall subvert similarly to the conversion, I mean by similarly, if the conversion is made contrarily (we shall subvert it contrarily), but if contradictorily by contradiction.

If however B is with every C, but A with no C, A is not with every B, the last figure.
If then B C 2. (the conclusion) be converted contradictorily, A B may be de­ monstrated similarly,6 and A C contradictorily.
For if B is with a certain C,7 but A with no C, A will not be present with a certain B;
again, if B 8 is with a certain C, but A with every B, A is with a certain C, so that there is a syllo-

gism produced contradictorily.
1
In like manner it can be shown, if the premises are vice versa, but if the syllogism is particular, the conclusion being converted contrarily, neither premise is subverted, as neither was it in the first figure, (if however the conclusion is) contradictorily (con­ verted), both (are subverted).
For let A be as­ sumed present with no B, but with a (certain) C,3 the conclusion B C ;
if then B is assumed present with a certain C, and A B remains, the conclusion will be that A is not present with a certain C, but the original would not be subverted, for it may and may not be present with a certain individual.
Again, if B is with a certain C, and A with a certain C, there will not be a syllogism, for neither of the assumed premises is universal, wherefore A B is not sub­ verted.
If however the conversion is made contradictorily, both are subverted, since if B is with every C, but A with no B, A is with no C, it was however present with a certain (C).3 Again, if B is with every C, but A with a certain C, A will be with a certain B, and there is the same demonstration, if the universal proposition be affirmative.
1.
In this figure, if the contrary to the conclu­ sion is assum­ ed, neither premise is sub­ verted, but if the contradic­ tory, both.
IN the third figure, when the conclusion is con­ verted contrarily, neither premise is subverted, according to any of the syllogisms, but when con­ tradictorily, both are in all the modes.
For let A be shown to be with a certain B, and let C be taken as the middle, and the premises be universal:
if then A is assumed not present with a certain B, but B with every C, there is no syllogism of A and C,4 1. Universals.
nor if A is not present with a certain B, but with every C, will there be a syllogism of B and C.6
There will also be a similar demonstration, if the premises are not universal, for either both must be particular by con­ version, or the universal be joined to the minor, but thus there was not a syllogism neither in the first nor in the middle figure.
It however they are converted contra­ dictorily, both propositions are subverted;
for 2. if A is with no B, but B with every C, A will be with no C ;
again, if A is with no B, but with every C, B will be with no C.
In like manner if one proposition is not uni­ versal ;
since if A is with no B, but B with a 3.
certain C, A will not be with a certain C, but if A is with no B, but with every C, B will be present with no C.
So also if the syllogism be negative, for let A be shown not pre­ sent with a certain B, and let the affirmative proposition be B C, but the negative A C, for thus there was a syllogism ;
when then the proposition is taken contrary to the conclusion, there will not be a syllogism.
For if A were with a certain B, but B with every C, there was not a syllogism of A and C,*1 nor if A were with a certain B, but with no C was there a syllogism of B and C,† so that the propositions are not subverted.
When however the contradictory (of the conclusion is assumed) they are subverted.
For if A is with every B, and B with C, A will be with every C, but it was with none.

6
Hence in that way,† but not in this,‡ the pro­ positions are subverted.
From what has been said then it seems clear how, when the conclusion is converted, a syllogism arises in each figure, both when contrarily and when contradictorily to the proposition, and that in the first figure syllogisms are produced through the middle and the last, and the minor premise is always subverted through the middle (figure), but the major by the last (figure) :
in the se­ cond figure, however, through the first and the last, and the minor premise (is) always (subverted) through the first figure, but the major through the last:
but in the third (figure) through the first and through the middle, and the major pre­ mise is always (subverted) through the first, but the minor premise through the middle (figure).
What therefore con­ version is, and how it is effected in each figure, also what syllogism is produced, has been shown.
A SYLLOGISM through the impossible is shown, when the contradiction of the conclusion is laid down, and another proposition is assumed, and it is produced in all the figures, for it is like convex sion except that it differs insomuch as that it is converted indeed, when a syllogism has been made, and both propositions have been assumed, but it is de­ duced to the impossible, when the opposite is not previously acknowledged but is manifestly true.
Now the terms subsist similarly 1 in both, the assumption also of both is the same, as for instance, if A is present with every B, but the middle is C, if A is supposed present with every or with no B, but with every C, which was true, it is necessary that C should be with no or not with every B.
But this is impossible, so that the supposition is false, wherefore the opposite 2 is true.
It is a similar case with other figures, for whatever are capable of conversion, are also capable of the syllogism per impossibile.
I. The univer- Mal affirm.
in the first figure not demonstra-All other problems then are demonstrated through the impossible in all the figures, but the universal affirmative is demonstrated in the mid- die, and in the third, but is not in the first.
For let A be supposed not present with every B, or ble per impos­ sibile.
present with no B, and let the other proposition be assumed from either part, whether C is present with every A, or B with every D, for thus there will be the first figure.
If then A is supposed not present with every B, there is no syllo­ gism,1 from whichever part the proposition is assumed, but if (it is supposed that A is present with) no (B), when the pro­ position B D is assumed, there will indeed be a syllogism of the false, but the thing proposed is not demonstrated.
For if A is with no B, but B with every D, A will be with no D, but let this be impossible, therefore it is false that A is with no B.
If however it is false that it is present with no B, it does not follow that it is true that it is present with every B.
But if C A is assumed, there is no syllogism,2 neither when A is supposed not present with every B, so that it is manifest that the being present with every, is not demonstrated in the first figure per impossibile.
But to be present with a certain one, and with none, and not with every is de­ monstrated, for let A be supposed present with no B, but let B be assumed to be present with every or with a certain C, therefore is it neces­ sary that A should be with no or not with every C, but this is impossible, for let this be true and 3.
But the par. affir. and univ. nega. may be demonstrated, when the con­ tradictory of the conclusion is assumed.
manifest, that A is with every C, so that if this is false, it is necessary that A should be with a certain B.
But if one proposition should be assumed to A,3 there will not be a syllogism,4 neither when the contrary to the conclusion is supposed as not to be with a certain one, wherefore it appears that the contradictory must be supposed.
Again, let A be sup­ posed present with a certain B, and C assumed present with every A, then it is necessary that C should be with a certain B, but let this be impossible, hence the hypothesis is false, and if this be the case, that A is present with no B is true.
In like manner, if C A is assumed negative;
if however the proposition be assumed to B, there will not be a syllogism, but if the contrary be supposed, there will be a syllogism, and the impossibile (demonstration), but what was proposed will not be proved.
For let A be supposed present with every B, and let C be assumed present with every A, then it is neces­ sary that C should be with every B, but this is impossible, so that it is false that A is with every B, but it is not yet neces­ sary that if it is not present with every, it is present with no B.
The same will happen also if the other proposition 1 is assumed to B, for there will be a syllogism, and the impossible (will be proved), but the hypothesis is not subverted, so that the contradictory must be supposed.
In order however to prove that A is not present with every B, it must be supposed 4.
Also the par.

present with every B, for if A is present with every B, and C with every A, C will be with every B, so that if this impossible, the hypothesis is false.
In the same manner, if the other proposi­ tion is assumed to B,2 also if C A is negative in the same way, for thus there is a syllogism, but if the negative be applied to B, there is no demon­ stration.
If however it should be supposed not present with every, but with some one, there is no demonstration that it is not present with every, but that it is present with none, for if A is with a certain B, but C with every A, C will be with a certain B, if then this is impossible it is false that A is present with a certain B, so that it is true that it is present with none.
This however being demonstrated, what is true is subverted besides, for A was present with a certain B, and with a cer­ tain one was not present.
Moreover, the impossibile does not result from the hypothesis, for it would be false, since we cannot conclude the false from the true, but now it is true, for A is with a certain B, so that it must not be supposed pre­ sent with a certain, but with every B.
The like also will occur, if we should show that A is not present with a certain B, since if it is the same thing not to be with a certain indi­ vidual, and to be not with every, there is the same demon­ stration of both.
It appears then, that not the contrary, but the contradictory must be supposed in all syllogisms,1 for thus there will be a necessary (consequence), and a probable axiom,2 for if of every thing af- 5.
Summary and reason of the above as­ sumption.
Urination or negation (is true), when it is shown that negation is not, affirmation must necessarily be true.
Again, except it is admitted that affirmation is true, it is fitting to admit nega­ tion ;
but it is in neither way fitting to admit the contrary, for neither, if the being present with no one is false, is the being present with every one necessarily true, not is it probable that if the one is false the other is true.
It is palpable, therefore, that in the first figure, all other problems are demonstrated through the impossible;
but that the universal affirmative is not demonstrated.
IN the middle, however, and last figure, this3 also is demonstrated.
For let A be supposed not pre­ sent with every B, but let A be supposed present with every C, therefore if it is not present with every B, but is with every C, C is not with every B, but this is impossible, for let it be manifest 1.
In the second figure A is proved per ab­ surdum, if the contradictory is assumed, not if the contrary.
that C is with every B, wherefore what was supposed is false, and the being present with every individual is true.
If how­ ever the contrary be supposed, there will be a syllogism, and the impossible, yet the proposition is not demonstrated.
For if A is present with no B, but with every C, C will be with no B, but this is impossible, hence that A 1. is with no B is false.
Still it does not follow, that if this is false, the being present with every B is true, but when A is 2. with a certain B, let A be supposed present with no B, but with every C, therefore it is necessary that C should be with no B, so that if this is impossible A must * A. t B. necessarily be present with a certain B. Still if it- is supposed not present with a certain one,t there will be the same 1 as in the first figure.
Again, let A be supposed present with a certain B, but let it be with no C, it is necessary then that C should not be with a certain B, but it was with every, so that the supposition is 3.
false, A then will be with no B.
When however A is not with every B, let it be supposed present with every B, but with no C, therefore it is necessary that C should be with no B, and this is impossible, wherefore it is true that A is not with every B.
Evidently then all syllogisms are produced through the middle figure.
21.
In this figure both affirma­ tives and nega­ tives are de­ monstrable per absurdum.
THROUGH the last figure also, (it will be con­ cluded) in a similar way.
For let A be supposed not present with a certain B, but C present with every B, A then is not with a certain C, and if this is impossible, it is false that A is not with a certain B, wherefore that it is present with every B is true.
If, again, it should be supposed present with none, there will be a syllogism, and the impossible, but the proposition is not proved, for if the contrary is supposed there will be the same3 as in the former (syllogisms).
But in order to con­ clude that it is present with a certain one, this hypothesis must be assumed, for if A is with no B, but C with a certain B, A will not be with every C, if then this is false, it is true that A is with a certain B.
But when A is with no B, let it be supposed present with a certain one, and let C be assumed present with every B, wherefore it is necessary that A should be with a certain C, but it was with no C, so that it is false that A is with a certain B.
If however A is supposed present with every B, the proposition is not demonstrated,1 but in order to its not being present with every, this hypothesis must be taken.
2
For if A is with every B, and C with a cer­ tain B, A is with a certain C, but this was not so, hence it is false that it is with every one, and if thus, it is true that it is not with every B, and if it is supposed present with a cer­ tain B, there will be the same things as in the syllogism:
above mentioned.
It appears then that in all syllogisms through the impossible the contradictory must be supposed, and it is apparent that in the middle figure the 2.

Both therefore assume two allowed propositions, but the one 5 assumes those from which the syllogism is formed, and the other 6 one of these, and the contradictory of the con­ elusion.

it is of no conse­ quence however whether the conclusion is affirmative or negative, but it will happen the same about both.
1
Now whatever is concluded ostensively can also be proved per im­ possible, and what is concluded per impossibile may be shown ostensively through the same terms, but not in the same figures.
2. What is de­ monstrated per absurdum in the first figure, is proved in the second, osten­ sively, if the problem be ne­ gative, and in the third figure if it be affirm­ ative.
1. * Darii.
For when the syllogism2 is in the first figure,3 the truth will be in the middle, or in the last, the ne­ gative indeed in the middle, but the affirmative in the last.
When however the syllogism is in the middle figure,4 the truth will be in the first in all the problems, but when the syllogism is in the last, the truth will be in the first and in the mid­ dle, affirmatives in the first, but negatives in the middle.
For let it be demonstrated through the first figure * that A is present with no, or not with every B, the hypothesis then was that A is with a certain B, but C was assumed present with every A, but with no B, for thus there was a syllogism, and also the impossible.

3. What is de­ monstiable per absurdum is so also ostensive- ly, and vice versâ.
like manner it will be possible when the syllo­ gisms are ostensive, to deduce to the impossible in the assumed terms when the proposition is taken contradic­ tory to the conclusion.
For the same syllogisms arise as those through conversion, so that we have forthwith figures through which each (problem) will be (concluded).
It is clear then that every problem is demonstrated by both modes, (viz.) by the impossible and ostensively, and we cannot possibly separ­ ate the one from the other.
1.
Of the vari­ ous figures from which a syllogism is de­ ducible from opposite pro­ positions, the atter(κατα τὴν λεξιν) of four kinds, (cf. Herm. 7,) but κατὰ τὴνἀλη­ θειαν, of three.
IN what figure then we may, and in what we may not, syllogize from opposite propositions1 will be manifest thus, and I say that opposite propositions are according to diction four, as for instance (to be present) with every (is opposed) to (to be pre­ sent) with none ;
and (to be present) with every to (to be present) not with every ;
and (to be pre­ sent) with a certain one to (to be present with) no one ;
and (to be present with) a certain one to (to be present) not with a certain one ;
in truth however they are three, for (to be present) with a certain one is opposed to (being present) not with a certain one accord­ ing to expression only.
But of these I call such contraries as are universal, viz. the being present with every, and (the being present) with none, as for instance, that every science is excellent to no science is excellent, but I call the others contradictories.
In the first figure then there is no syllogism from contradictory propositions, neither affirma­ tive nor negative ;
not affirmative, because it is necessary that both propositions should be 2.
No conclu­ sion from oppo­ sites of either kind in the first figure.
affirmative, but affirmation and negation are contradictories:
nor negative, because contradictories affirm and deny the same thing of the same,* but the middle in the first figure is not predicated of both (extremes), but one thing is denied of it, and it is predicated of another;
these propositions however are not con­ tradictory.
* Vide Aid­ rich's Logic, ch. ii. sect.

But in the middle figure it is possible to pro­ duce a syllogism both from contradictories and from contraries, for let A be good, but science B 3.

and C;
if then any one assumed that every science is excel­ lent, and also that no science is, A will be with every B, and with no C, so that B will be with no C, no science there­ fore t is science.
It will be the same also, if, having assumed that every science is excellent, t Example (1.) it should be assumed that medicine is not excellent, for A is with every B, but with no C, so that a certain science will not be science.
t
Likewise if A is with every C, but with no B, and B is science, C medicine, A opinion, ‡ Example (2.) for assuming that no science is opinion, a person would have assumed a certain science to be opinion.

so subsist as either to be the same, or as a whole to a part:
1 otherwise it is impossible, for the propositions will by no means be either contrary or contradictory.
4.
In the third no affirmative is deduced.
In the third figure there will never be an af­ firmative syllogism from opposite propositions, for the reason alleged in the first figure;
but there will be a negative, both when the terms are and are not uni­ versal.
For let science.
be B and C, and medicine A, if then a person assumes that all medicine is science, and that no medicine is science, he would assume B present with every A, † Example (4.) and C with no A, so that a certain science will not be science.†
Likewise, if the proposition A B is not taken as universal, for if a certain medicine is science, and again no medicine is science, it results that a certain sci­ ‡ Example (5.) ence is not science.t
But the propositions are contrary, the terms being universally taken,2 if however one of them is particular,3 they are contradictory.
We must however understand that it is possible thus to as­ sume opposites as we have said, that every science is good, and again, that no science is good, or that a certain science is not good, which does not usually lie concealed.
It is also possible to conclude either (of the opposites), through other § Top. book viii.
ch. 1. 5. Opposition six-fold.
interrogations, or as we have observed in the Topics, § to assume it.
Since however the op­ positions of affirmations are three, it results that we may take opposites in six ways, either with every and with none, or with every and not with every indi­ vidual, or with a certain and with no one;
and to convert this in the terms, thus A (may be) with every B but with no C, or with every C and with no B, or with the whole of the one, but not with the whole of the other;
and again, we may convert this as to the terms.
It will be the same also in the third figure, so that it is clear in how many ways and in what figures it is possible for a syllogism to arise through op­ posite propositions.
But it is also manifest that we may infer a true conclusion from false premises, as we have ob­ served.
before, but from opposites we cannot, for a syllogism always arises contrary to the fact, as if a thing is good, (the conclusion will be,) that it is not good, or if it is an animal, that it is not an * Vide this book, chapters 2, 3, and 4. 6. No true con­ clusion deduci­ ble from such propositions.
animal, because the syllogism is from contradiction, and the subject terms are either the same, or the one is a whole,† but the other a part.t
It appears also evident, that in paralogisms1 there is nothing to prevent a contradiction of the hypothesis arising, as if a thing is an odd number, that it is not odd, for from opposite propositions there was a con­ trary syllogism;
if then one assumes such, there t Genus.

will be a contradiction of the hypothesis.
We must under­ stand, however, that we cannot so conclude contraries from one syllogism, as that the conclusion may be that what is not good is good, or any thing of this kind, unless such a pro­ position is immediately assumed,2 as that every animal is white and not white, and that man is an animal.
3
But we must either presume contradiction,.
as that all science is opinion,5 and is not opinion, and afterwards assume that medicine is a sci­ ence indeed, but is no opinion, just as Elenchi6 are produced, or (conclude) from two syllo-
8. To infer con­ tradiction in the conclusion, we must have contradiction in the premises.
(Vide Whately, b.ii.c. 2 and 3.) gisms.1
Wherefore, that the things assumed should really be contrary, is impossible in any other way than this, as was be­ fore observed.
1.
What the " petitio prin­ cipii" is—τὸ ἐνόρχη̃ αἰτεισ­ θαι.
To beg and assume the original (question) con­ sists, (to take the genus of it,) in not demon­ strating the proposition, and this happens in many ways, whether a person does not conclude at all, or whether he does so through things more unknown, or equally unknown, or whether (he concludes) what is prior through what is pos­ t Vide Post.
An. b. i. ch. 2, 10, 32. tenor ;
for demonstration is from things more creditable and prior.†
Now of these there is no begging the question from the beginning, but since some things are naturally adapted to be known through them­ selves, and some through other things, (for principles3 are I Conclusions.
2. How this fat­ lacy is effected.
See Hill'sLogic, p. 331, et seq.
Rhot. ii. 24. known through themselves, but what are under principles ‡ through other things,) when a person endeavours to demonstrate by itself what cannot be known by itself, then he begs the original question.
It is possible however to do this so as immediately to take the thing proposed for granted, and it is also possible, that passing to other things which are naturally adapted to be demonstrated by that (which was to be investi. gated), to demonstrate by these the original proposition;
as if a person should demonstrate A through B, and B through C, while C was naturally adapted to be proved through A for it happens that those who thus syllogize, prove A by itself.
This they do,1 who fancy that they describe parallel lines, for they deceive themselves 2. Example given of ma­ thematicians.
by assuming such things as they cannot demonstrate unless they are parallel.
Hence it occurs to those who thus syllo­ gize to say that each thing is, if it is, and thus every thing will be known through itself, which is impossible.
If then a man, when it is not proved that A is with C, and likewise with B, begs that A may be 3.
admitted present with B, it is not yet evident whether he begs the original proposition, but that he does not prove it is clear, for what is similarly doubtful is not the principle of demonstration.
If however B so subsists in reference to C as to be the same,2 or that they are evidently convertible, or that one is present with the other,3 then he begs the original question.
For that A is with B, may be shown through them, if they are converted, but now4 this prevents5 it, yet not the mode ;
if however it should do this,.
it would produce what has been mentioned before,!
and a conver- 4. * i. e. convert the minor, and prove A of B through C. 5. t Beg the question.
sion would be made through three terms.
6
In like manner if any one should take B to be present with C, whilst it is qually doubtful if he assumes A also (present with C), he does not yet beg the question, but he does not prove it.
If however A and B should be the same, or should be converted, or A should follow B, he begs the question from the beginning for the same reason, for what the petitio principii can effect we have shown before, viz. to demonstrate a thing by itself which is not of itself manifest.

This fallacy may occur in both the 2nd and 3rd figures, but in the case of an affirma­ tive syllogism by the 3rd and first.
If then the petitio principii is to prove by it­ self what is not of itself manifest, this is not to prove, since both what is demonstrated and that by which the person demonstrates are alike du­ bious, either 1 because the same things are assumed present with the same thing, or the same thing with the same things ;

syllogism, in the third and first figure.
3
Negatively when the same things are absent from the same, and both propositions are not alike,4 (there is the same result also in the middle figure,) because of the non­ conversion of the terms in negative syllogisms.5
A petitio principii however occurs in demonstrations, as to things which thus exist in truth, but in dialectics as to those (which so sub­ sist) according to opinion.
THAT the false does not happen on account of this (which we are accustomed to say frequently in discussion) occurs first in syllogisms leading to the impossible, when a person contradicts that which was demonstrated by a deduction to the impossible.
For neither will he who does not con-

tradet assert that it is not (false) on this account, but that something false was laid down before ;
2 nor in the ostensive (proof), since he does not lay down a contradiction.
Moreover when any thing is ostensively subverted through A B C,* we cannot say that a syllogism is pro­ duced not on account of what is laid down, for we * i. e. osten­ sively through those terms.
then say that is not produced on account of this, when this being subverted, the syllogism is nevertheless completed, which is not the case in ostensive syllogisms, since the thesis being subverted the syllogism which belongs to it will no longer subsist.
It is evident then that in syllogisms leading to the impossible, the assertion, " not on account of this," is made, and when the original hypothesis so subsists in refer­ ence to the impossible as that both when it is, and when it is not, the impossible will nevertheless occur.
Hence the clearest mode of the false not subsist­ ing on account of the hypothesis, is when the syllogism leading to the impossible 3 does not con­ join with the hypothesis by its media, as we have observed in the t Topics.
For this is to assume as a cause, what is not a cause, as if any one wishing to show that the diameter of a square is incom-

t Sop. Elen. ch. v. mensurate with its side should endeavour to prove the argu­ * Sop. Elen. x. 2, 33, 4. ment of Zeno, that motion has no existence, and to this should deduce the impossible, for the false is by no means whatever connected with what was stated from the first.
1
There is however another mode, if the impossible should be connected with the hypothesis, yet it does not happen on account of that, for this may occur, whether we assume the connexion up or down, as if A is placed present with B, B with C, and C with D, but this should be false, that B is with D. For if A being subverted B is neverthe- 3. Another mode.
less with C, and C with D, there will not be the false from the primary hypothesis.
Or again, if a person should take the connexion upward, as if 2.
A should be with B, E with A, and F with E, ' but it should be false that F is with A, for thus there will be no less the impossible, when the primary hypo-

thesis is subverted.
It is necessary however to unite the impossible with the terms (assumed) from the beginning, for thus it will be on account of the hypothesis ;
† as to a person taking the connexion downward, (it ought to be connected) with the affirmative term ;
for if it is impossible that A should be with D, when A is removed there will no longer be the false.
But (the connexion being assumed) in an upward direction, (it should be joined) with the subject, for if F cannot be with B, when B is subverted, there will no longer be the impossible, the same also occurs when the syllogisms are negative.
It appears then that if the impossible is not connected with the original terms, the false does not happen on account of the thesis, or is it that neither thus will the false occur always on account of the hypothesis ?
For if A is placed present not with B but with K, and K with C, and this with D, thus also the impossible remains;
and in like manner when we take the terms in an upward direction, so that since the impossible happens whether this is or this is not, it will not be on account of the position.*
Or if this is not, the false ne­ vertheless arises;
it must not be so assumed, as if the impossible will happen from something else being laid down, but when this being subverted, the same impossible is concluded through the re­ maining propositions, since perhaps there is no absurdity in inferring the false through several * i. e. the hy.
pothesis.

hypotheses, as that parallel lines meet, both whether the in­ ternal angle is greater than the external, or whether a tri­ angle has more than two right angles.
FALSE reasoning arises from what is primarily false.
For every syllogism consists of two or more propositions, if then it consists of two, it is necessary that one or both of these should be false, for there would not be a false syllogism from true propositions.†
But if of more than two, as if C (is proved) through A B, and these through D E I.

Hence through some one of them the conclusion and the false occur.

To prevent a syllogistical conclusion being ad­ duced against us, we must observe narrowly when (our opponent) questions the argument5 without conclusions, lest the same thing should be twice granted in the propositions, since we know that 1.
Rule to pre­ vent the ad­ vancement of a catasyllogism is to watch against the same term being twice ad­ mitted in the prop.
a syllogism is not produced without a middle, but the middle is that of which we have frequently spoken.
But in what manner it is necessary to observe the middle in regard to each conclusion, is clear from our knowing what kind of thing is proved in each figure, and this will not escape us in consequence of knowing how we sustain the argument.
1 2. Necessity and method of masking our design in ar­ gument—two ways of effect­ ing this.
Still it is requisite, when we argue, that we should endeavour to conceal that which we direct the respondent to guard against,2 and this will be done, first, if the conclusions are not pre-syllogized, but are unknown when necessary propositions are assumed, and again, if a person does not question those things which are proximate, but such as are especially * Vide Man. sel's Logic. immediate,.
for instance, let it be requisite to con­ clude A of F, and let the media be B C D E;
therefore we must question whether A is with B, and again, not whether B is with C, but whether D is with E, and afterwards whether B is with C, and so of the rest.
If also the syllogism arises through one middle, we must begin with the middle, for thus especially we may deceive the re­ spondent.
SINCE however we have when, and from what man­ ner of terminal subsistence syllogism is produced, it is also clear when there will and will not be an Elenchus.
For all things being granted, or the an­ swers being arranged alternately, for instance, the one being negative and the other affirmative, an elen­ chus may be produced, since there was a syllogism when the terms were as well in this as in that way, so that if what is laid down should be con­ gism of contra­ diction, to pro­ duce which there must be a syllogism- though the lat­ ter may subsist without the former.
(Conf. Sop. Elen. 6.) trary to the conclusion, it is necessary that an elenchus should be produced, for an elenchus is a syllogism of contradiction.
If however nothing is granted, it is impossible that there should be an elenchus, for there was not a syllogism when all the terms are negative, so that there will neither be an elen­ cbus, for if there is an elenchus, it is necessary there should be a syllogism, but if there is a syllogism, it is not necessary there should be an elenchus.
Likewise, if nothing should be universally laid down in the answer,* for the determination of the elenchus and of the syllogism will be the same.
1 * i. e. if the respondent should not con­ cede any uni­ versal proposi­ tion.
SOMETIMES it happens, that as we are deceived in the position of the terms, t so also deception arises as to opinion, for example, if the same thing happens to be present with many things primary,3 and a Conf. Meta. lib. vi. and iii., and de AnimA, ii. 3, 7. 1. This kind of deception two­ fold.
t Vide ch. 33, Pri. An. i. person should be ignorant of one, and think that it is present with nothing, but should know the other.
For let A be present with B and with C, 1. per se, (that is, essentially,) and let these, in like manner, be with every D ;
if then somebody thinks that A is with every B, and this with every D, but A with no C, and this with every D;
he will have knowledge ‡ and ignorance § of the same thing, ∥ as to the same.
¶Again, if one should be deceived about those things which are from the same class, * as if A is with B, but this with C, and C with D, and should apprehend A to be with every B, and again with no C, he will at the same time both know and not apprehend its presence.
Will he then admit nothing else from these things, than that he does not form an opinion on what he knows ?
2 for in some way, he knows that A is with C through t C being a part of B. t i. e. in the first deception.
2. Case of the middles in Bar­ bara and Cela­ rent, not being subaltern.
§ The major of Barbara. || Major of Celarent. ¶
The minor of both.
B, just as the particular is known in the t uni­ versal, so that what he somehow knows, he ad­ mits he does not conceive at all, which is impos­ sible.
In what, however, we mentioned before,t if the middle is not of the same class, it is impos­ sible to conceive both propositions, according to each of the media,3 as if A were with every B,§ but with no C,|| and both these with every D.¶
For it happens that the major proposition assumes a contrary, either simply or partially,4 for if with every thing with which B is present a person thinks A is present, but knows that B is with D, he also will know that A is with D.
Hence, if, again, he thinks that A is with nothing with which C is, he will not think that A is with any thing with which B is, but that he who thinks that it is with every thing with which B is, should again think that it is not with something with which B is, is either simply or partially contrary.
Thus however it is impossible to think, still nothing prevents (our * i. e. B and C. assuming) one proposition according to each (mid­ dle),6 * or both according to one, as that A is with every B, and B with D, and again, A with no C.
For a de­ ception of this kind resembles that by which we are deceived about particulars, as if A is with every B, but B with every C, A will be with every C.6
If then a man knows that A is with every thing with which B is, he knows also that it is with C ;
still nothing prevents his being ignorant of the ex­ istence of C, as if A were two right angles, B a triangle, and C a perceptible triangle.*
For a man may think that C does not exist, knowing that every triangle * Example (1. has two (equal to) right angles, hence he will know and be ignorant of the same thing at once ;
for to know that every triangle has angles equal to two right, is not a simple thing,f but in one respect arises from possessing universal science, in another, par­ ticular science.
Thus therefore he knows by uni­ versal science, that C has angles equal to two right 3.

t i. e. it is " an. ceps ambi­ guum."
Waitz. angles, but by particular science he does not know it, so that he will not hold contraries.
In like manner is the reasoning in the Meno,t that discipline is reminiscence, for it never happens that we have a pre-existent know­ ledge of particulars, but together with induction, § receive the science of particulars as it were by t Meno, (Plat.) p. 81. Ritter, vol. ii. p. 293. § Cf. Eth. vi. 4. recognition ;
since some things we immediately know, as (that there are angles) equal to two right angles, if we know that (what we see) is a triangle, and in like manner as to other things.
By universal knowledge then we observe par­ ticulars,1 but we do not know them by an (innate) 4. Our observ­ ation of parti- fulan, derived from our know­ ledge of uni­ versals, a pecu­ liarity noticed.
(Met. book vi. 9.) Locke's Ess. vi. 4, v. 5, and vi. 2. peculiar knowledge, hence we may be deceived about them, yet not after a contrary manner, but while possessing the universal, yet are deceived in the particular.
It is the same also as to what we have spoken of, for the deception about the middle is not contrary to science about syllogism, nor the opinion as to each of the middles.
Still nothing prevents one who knows that A is with the whole of B, and this again with C, thinking that A is not with C, as he who knows that every mule is barren, and that this (animal) is a mule, may think that this is pregnant;
for he does not know that A is with C 5.
A deception from knowing one prop. and being ignorant of the other.
from not at the same time surveying each.
Hence it is evident that if he knows one (of the proposi­ tions), but is ignorant of the other, he will be de­ ceived as to how the universal subsists with refer­ ence to the particular sciences.
For we know nothing of those things which fall under the senses as existent apart from sense,1 not even if we happen to have perceived it before, un­ less in so far as we possess universal and peculiar knowledge, 6. Scientific knowledge is predicated triply.
and not in that we energize.
For to know is pre­ dicated triply, either as to the universal or to the peculiar (knowledge), or as to energizing, so that to be deceived is likewise in as many ways.
Nothing therefore prevents a man both knowing and being de* * i. e. so as not to hold a self­ ceived about the same thing, but not in a con­ trary manner,* and this happens also to him, who knows each proposition, yet has not considered before ;

(Vide Met. 8.)Notwithstanding, whoever thinks that the very being of good is the very being of evil, will ap­ prehend that there is the same essence of good and of evil;

Since then he thinks that B and C are the same, he will also think that C is B;
and again, in a similar manner, that B is A, wherefore that C is A.†
For just as if it were true that of what C is predi­ t Example (2.) cated B is, and of what B is, A is ;
it was also true that A is predicated of C;
so too in the case of the verb " to opine."
In like manner, as regards the verb "to be," for C and B being the same, and again, B and A, C also is the same as A.
Likewise, as regards to opine, is then this necessary,4 if any one should grant the first?
but perhaps that is false, that any one should think that the essence of good is the essence of evil, unless accidentally,6 for we may opine this in many ways, but we must consider it better.
71. If the terms connected by a certain middle are converted, the middle must be con­ verted with both.*
The major.t
The minor.
WHEN the extremes are converted, the middle must necessarily be converted with both.
For if A is present with C through B, if it is converted, and C is with whatever A is, B also is converted with A,. and with whatever A is present, B also is through the middle C, and C is converted with B t through the middle A.
The same will occur with negatives, as if B is with C,l but A is not with B,2 neither will A be with C, if then B is converted with A, C also will be converted with A.
For let B not be with A,3 neither then will C be4 with A, since B was with every C, and if C is converted with B, (the latter is also converted 2. with A;
for of whatever B is predicated, C also is, and if C is converted with A, B also is con­ verted with A, for with whatever B is present, C also is,5 but 3.
The mode of converting a negative syllo­ gism, begins from the con­ clusion, as in Barbara.
C is not present with what A is.
This also alone begins from the conclusion, (but the others not similarly,) as in the case of an affirmative syllo­ gism, Again, if A and B are converted, and C and D likewise;
but A or C must necessarily be present with every individual;
B and D also will so subsist, as that one of them will be present with every individual.
For since B is present with whatever A is, and D with what­ eyer C is, but A or C with every individual, and not both at the same time, it is evident that B or D is with every indi­ vidual, and not both of them at the same time;
for two syllo­ ‡ Omitted by Waltz.
2. gisms are conjoined.‡
Again, if A or B is with every individual and C or D, but they are not present at the same time, if A and C are converted B also and D are converted, since if B is not present with a certain thing with which D is, it is evident that A is present with it.
But if A is, C also will be, for they are converted, so that C and D will be present at the same time, but this is impossible ;
1 as if what is unbegotten is incorruptible, and what is incorruptible unbegotten, it is necessary that what is be­ gotten should be corruptible, and the corruptible begotten.
But when A is present with the whole of B and C, and is predicated of nothing else, and B also is with every C, it is necessary that A and B should be converted, as since A is predicated of B C alone, but B itself is predicated both of it­ self and of C, it is evident that of those things of which A is predicated, of all these B will also be predicated, except of A itself.
Again, when A and B are with the whole of C, and C is converted with B, it is necessary that A should be with every B, for since A is with every C, but C with B in conse­ quence of reciprocity, A will also be with every B.
But when of two opposites A is preferable to B, and D to C likewise, if A C are more eligible than B D, A is preferable to D, in like manner A should 4.

be followed and B avoided, since they are opposites, and C (is to be similarly avoided) and D (to be pursued), for these are opposed.
If then A is similarly eligible with D, B also is simi­ larly to be avoided with C, each (opposite) to each, in like man­ ner, what is to be avoided to what is to be pursued.
Hence both fare similar) A C with B D, but because (the one are) more (eli­ gible than the other they) cannot be similarly (eligible), for (else) B D would be similarly (eligible) (with A C).
If however D is preferable to A, B also is less to be avoided than C, for the less is opposed to the less, and the greater good and the less evil are prefer­ able to the less good and the greater evil, where-

fore the whole B D is preferable to A C.
Now however this is not the case, hence A is preferable to D, consequently C is less to be avoided than B.
If then every lover accord­ ing to love chooses A, that is to be in such a condition as to be gratified, and C not to be gratified, rather than be gratified, which is D, and yet not be in a condition to be gratified, which is B, it is evident that A, i. e. to be in a condition to be gratified, is preferable to being gratified.

To be loved then is preferable according to love to intercourse, wherefore love is rather the cause of affection than of intercourse, but if it is especially 6.
The desire of the end, the incentive to the pursuit.
(Eth. b. i. c. 7.) * Waitz con­ cludes the chapter here.
(the cause) of this, this also is the end.
Where­ fore intercourse either, in short, is not or is for the sake of affection, since the other desires and arts are thus produced.*
How therefore terms sub­ sist as to conversion, also in their being more eli­ gible or more to be avoided, has been shown.
1.
Not only di­ alectic and apo­ deictic syllo­ gisms, but also rhetorical, and every species of demonstration, are through the above-named figures.
WE must now show that not only dialectic and demonstrative syllogisms are produced through the above-named figures, but that rhetorical are also, and in short, every kind of demonstration and by every method.
For we believe all things either through syllogism or from induction.
Induction, then, and the inductive syllogism is to prove one extreme in the middle through the other,3 as if B is the middle of A C, and we show through C that A is with B, for thus we make inductions.
Thus let A be long- lived, B void of bile, C every thing long-lived, as man, horse, mule;
A then- is present with the whole of C, for every thing void of bile is long- lived, but B† also, or that which is void of bile, is present with every C, if then C is converted with B,t and does not exceed the middle, it is necessary that A should be with B.
For it has been before shown,1 that when any two things are present with the same thing, and the extreme is convertible with one of them, that the other 2.

predicate will also be present with that which is converted.
We must however consider C as composed of all singulars, for induction is produced through § all.
A syllogism of this kind however is of the first, and immediate proposition ;
for of those which have a middle, the syllogism is through the mid­ dle, but of those where there is not (a middle) it is by induction.
2
In some way also induction is opposed to syllogism, for the latter demonstrates the extreme ∥ of the third through the middle, but the former the extreme of the middle through the third.¶
To nature therefore the syllogism pro­ § Example (1.)

31.
παράειγμα, or example, is proving the major of the middle by a term resem­ bling the minor.
EXAMPLE is when the extreme is shown2 to be present with the middle through something similar to the third,3 but it is necessary to know that the middle is with the third, and the first with what is similar.
4
For example, let A be bad, B to (make war) upon neighbours, C the Athenians against the Thebans, D the 2. a Example.
Thebans against the Phocians.
If then we wish to show that it is bad to war against the Thebans, we must assume that it is bad to war against neighbours, but the demonstration of this is from similars, as that (the war) by the Thebans against the Phocians (was bad).
Since then war against neighbours is bad, but that against the Thebans is against neighbours, it is evidently bad to war against the Thebans, so that it is evident that B is with C, and with D, (since both are to war against neighbours,) and that A is with D, (for the war against the Phocians was not advantageous to the Thebans,) but that A is with B will be.

In the same manner also if the demon­ stration of the middle as to the extreme should be through many similars, wherefore it is evident that example is neither as part to a whole, nor as whole to a part, but as part to part, when both are under the same thing,2 but one is known.
It (example) also differs from induction, because the latter shows from all individuals that the extreme a 3.

ABDUCTION is when it is evident the first is pre­ sent with the middle,6 but it is not evident that the middle is with the last, though it is similarly credible, or more so, than the conclusion;
more-
1. ’Απαγωγὴ a syllogism with a major prem. certain, and the minor more credible than the con­ clusion.
over if the media of the last and of the middle be few, for it by all means happens that we shall be nearer to knowledge.
For instance, let A be what may be taught, B science, C justice ;
that science then may be taught is clear, but not whether justice is science.
If 2. Moreover when the minor is proved by the interposition of few middle terms.
* Example (1.) therefore B C is equally or more credible than A C,1 it is abduction, for we are nearer know­ ledge because of our assuming A C, not possess­ ing science before..
Or again, if the media of B C should be few, for thus we are nearer knowledge, as 2 if D should be to be squared, E a rectilinear figure, and F a circle, Vide Waitz in An. Pr. c. 24. t Example (2.) then if, of E F there is only one middle, for a circle to become equal to a rectilinear figure, through lunulse, will be a thing near to know­ ledge. †
But when neither B C is more ciedible than A C, nor the media fewer, I do not call this abduction nor when B C is immediate, for such a thing is knowledge.
OBJECTION is a proposition contrary to a propo­ sition, it differs however from a proposition be- cause objection may be partial, but proposition cannot be so at all, or not in universal syllo­ gisms.
Objection indeed is advanced in two ways, differs from a proposition in that it may.
be either καθόλου or πὶ μέρος. two figures, * i. e. affirm­ atives and negatives.

and by two figures ;
in two ways, because every objection is either universal or particular, and by because they are used opposite to the proposition, and opposites * are concluded in the first and third figure alone.
When then a person requires it to be admitted that any thing is present with every individual, we object either that it is with none, or that it is not with a certain one, and of these, the being present with none, (is shown) by the first figure,† but that it is not with a certain one by the last.t
For instance, let A be "there is one science, and B contraries;
" when therefore a person advances that there is one science of contraries, it is objected either that there is not the same science of opposites, altogether, § Example (1.) || Felapton. ¶ Example (2.) but contraries are opposites, so that there is the first figure ;
§ or that there is not one science of the known and of the unknown, and this is the third figure,|| for of C, that is, of the known, and of the unknown, it is true that they are contraries, but that there is one science of them is false.¶
Again, in like manner in a negative proposition, for if any one asserts that there is not one science of contraries, we say either that there is the same science of all opposites, or that there is of certain contraries, as of the salubrious, and of the noxious ;
* Barbara.
t Darapti. t Example (3.) 3. Rule for the καθολου ἐνστασις.
that there is therefore (one science) of all things is by the first figure,* but that there is of certain by the third.t
In short, in all (disputations) it is necessary that he who universally objects should apply a contradiction of the propositions to the universal,‡ as if some one should assert that there is not the same science of all contraries, (the ob­ jector) should say, that there is one of opposites.
For thus 4.
And for that it is necessary that there should be the first figure, since the middle becomes an universal to that (which was proposed) at first, but he who objects in part (must contradict that which is universal,§ ἐν μερει.
Vide note.
§ Subject of which the proposition is stated, as that there is not the same science of the known, and the unknown, for the contraries are universal with reference, to these..
The third figure is also produced, for what is par­ ticularly assumed is the middle, for instance, the known and the unknown;
as from what we may infer a contrary syllogistically, from the same we en­ deavour to urge objections.
Wherefore we adduce then (objections) from these figures only,† for in these alone opposite syllogisms are constructed, since we cannot conclude affirmatively through the middle figure.
1
Moreover, even if it were (pos­ sible), yet the (objection), in the middle figure would require more (extensive discussion), as if any one should not admit A to be present with B, * Contraries attributed to the known and unknown, as universal to particular.
5. Objection adduced in the first and third figures alone.
t Hence if the prop. is nega­ tive, an objec­ tion to it cannot be proper in the 2nd figure since the objection ought to affirm.
because C is not consequent to it, (B).
For this is manifest through other propositions, the objection however must not be diverted to other things, but should forthwith have the other proposition apparent,3 wherefore also from this figure alone there is not a sign.
4
We must consider also other objections, as those adduced from the contrary, from the similar, and from what is according to opinion,5 also whether it is possible to assume a particular objection from the first, or a negative from the middle figure.

2. A sign as­ sumed triply, according to the number of figures.
* Example (1.) t Example (2.) (a paralogism.) middle is to have milk.
Let A, be to be preg­ nant, B to have milk, C a woman.-
But that wise men are worthy, for Pittacus is a worthy man, is through the last figure, let A be worthy, B wise men, C Pittacus.
It is true then A and B are predicated of C, except that they do not as­ sert the one because they know it, but the other they assume.†
But that a woman is pregnant because she is pale, would be through the middle figure, for since paleness is a consequence of pregnancy, and also attends this woman, they fancy it proved that she is pregnant.
Let ‡ Example (3.) 3. If one prop. be enunciated, there is only a sign.
A be paleness, to be pregnant B, a woman C.t
If then one proposition should be enunciated, there is only a sign, but if the other also be assumed, there is a syllogism, as for instance that Pittacus is liberal, for the ambitious are liberal, and Pittacus is ambitious, or again, that the wise are good, for Pittacus is good and also wise.
Thus therefore syllogisms are produced, 4. Syllogism, if it be true, is in­ controvertible in the 1st fig., but not so in the last or 2nd fig.
except indeed that the one in the first figure is in­ controvertible if it be true, (for it is universal,) but that through the last is controvertible though the conclusion should be true, because the syllo­ gism is not universal nor to the purpose, for if Pittacus is worthy, it is not necessary that on this account other wise men also should be worthy.
But that which is by the middle figure is always and altogether con­ § i. e. when both premises affirm.
trovertible, for there is never a syllogism, when the terms thus subsist, § for it is not necessary, if she who is pregnant be pale, and this woman be pale, that this woman should be pregnant;
what is true therefore will be in all the figures,* but they have the above-named differences.
Either therefore the sign must be thus divided, but of these the middle must be assumed as the proof positive, (for the proof positive they say is that which produces knowledge, but the middle is especially a thing of this2 kind,) or we must call those from the3 extremes, signs, but what is from * Bekker and Waitz σημει̃οις- Taylor, Buhle, and Averrois, σχημσιν.

We may however form a judgment of the disposition by the body, if a person grants that whatever pas­ sions are natural, change at once the body and the soul,4 since perhaps one who has learned music has changed his soul in some respect, but this passion is not of those which are natural to us, 6.
By the ex­ ample of phy­ siognomy Aris­ totle shows that signs es­ pecially proba­ ble belong to the 1st figure.
but such as angers and desires, which belong to natural emo­ tions.
If therefore this should be granted, and one thing should be a sign of one (passion), and we are able to lay hold of the peculiar passion and sign of each genus, we shall be able 7.
The first physiognomic hypothesis is that natural passionchanges at one time the body and soul.
The 2nd, that there is one sign of one pas­ sion.
The 3rd, that the proper passion of each species of ani­ mal may be known.
to conjecture from nature.
For if a peculiar pas­ sion is inherent in a certain individual genus, as fortitude in lions, it is necessary also that there should be a certain sign, for it is supposed that they (the body and soul) sympathize with each other, and let this be the having great extremi­ ties, which also is contingent to other, not whole, general
For the sign is thus peculiar, because the passion is a peculiarity of the whole genus, and is not the peculiarity of it alone,2 as we are accustomed to say.
The same (sign) then will also be inherent in another genus, and man will be brave, and some other animal, it will then possess that sign,3 for there was one (sign) of one (passion).
If then these things are so, and we can collect such signs in those animals, which have one peculiar passion alone, but each (passion) has its (own) sign, since it is necessary that it should have one, we may be able to conjecture the nature from the bodily frame.
But if the whole genus have two peculiarities, as a lion has fortitude and liberality, how shall we know which of those signs that are peculiarly consequent is the sign, if either (passion) ?
Shall we say that we may know this, if both are inherent in some­ thing else, but not wholly,4 and in what each is not inherent wholly, when they have the one, they have not the other ;
for if a (lion) is brave, but not generous, but has this * from two signs, it is evident that in a lion also this is the sign of fortitude.
But to form a judgment of the natural disposition by the bodily frame, is, for this reason, in the first figure, be­ cause the middle reciprocates with the major term, but exceeds the third, and does not recipro­ * i. e. great extremities.

cate with it;
as for instance, let fortitude be A, great ex­ tremities B, and C a lion.
Wherefore B is present with every individual with which C is, but with others - also, and A is with every individual of that with which B is present, and with no more, but is converted, for if it were not, there would not be one sign of one (passion).
t1. All dianœ­ tic discipline is produced from previous knowledge, possessed in a two-fold re­ spect.
(Cf. Mag. Moral. lib. i. 18, and Eth. Eude. lib. v. c. 1,2, 3.)* Induction.
ALL doctrine, and all intellectual discipline,1 arise from pre-existent knowledge.
Now this is evi­ dent, if we survey them all, for both mathematical sciences are obtained in this manner, and also each of the other arts.
It is the same also with arguments, as well those which result through syllogisms, as those which are formed through induction, for both teach through things pre­ viously known, the one assuming as if from those who understood them,2 the other- demonstrat­ ing the universal by that which is evident as to the singular.
Likewise also do rhetoricians persuade, for they do so either through examples, which is induction, or through enthy­ t Vide Prior Anal.
b. it. c. ?7. mems, which is syllogism.†3
It is necessary how­ ever to possess previous knowledge in a twofold respect;
for with some things we must pre-sup­ pose that they are, but with others we must understand what that is which is spoken of;
and with others both must be known, as for instance, (we must pre-assume,) that of every thing it is true to affirm or deny that it is, but of a triangle, that it signifies so and so, and of the monad (we must know) both, viz.
what it signifies and that it is, for each of these is not manifest to us in a similar manner.
1
It is possible how ever to know from knowing some things previously,2 and re­ ceiving the knowledge of others at the same time, as of things which are contained under universals, and of which a man possesses knowledge.
3
For he knew before that every tri­ angle has angles equal to two right angles, but that this which is in a semi-circle is a triangle, he knew by induction at the same time.
For of some things knowledge is acquired after this manner, nor is the extreme known through the middle, as such things as are singulars, and are not predicated of any subject.
Perhaps however we must confess that we possess knowledge after a certain manner before induction or the as­ sumption of a syllogism, but in another manner not.
4
For what a man is ignorant about its existence at all, how could he know at all that it has two right angles ?
But it is evident that he thus knows because he knows the universal, but singly he does not know it.
Still if this be not admitted, the doubt which is mentioned in the Meno* will occur, either he will learn nothing, or those things which he knows,5 2. What we know univers­ ally and gener­ ally we may not know sin­ gly, although not in the same manner.
* Meno, Plato- nis Opera, Bek­ ker's ed. torn. iv. p. 32. for he must not say, as some endeavour to solve the doubt, " Do you know that every duad is an even number or not?" for since if some one says that he does, they would bring forward a certain duad which he did not think existed, as therefore not even;
and they solve the ambiguity, not by saying that he knew every duad to be even, but that he was ignorant as to what they know is a duad.
Nevertheless they know that of which they possess and have received the demonstration, but they have received it not of every thing which they know to be a triangle or a number, but of every number and triangle singly, for no pro­ position is assumed of such a kind as the number which you know, or the rectilinear figure which you know, but univers­ ally.
Still there is nothing (I think) to prevent a man who learns, in a certain respect knowing and in a certain respect being ignorant,1 for it is absurd, not that he should in some way know what he learns, but that he should thus know it, as he does when he learns it, and in the same manner.*
Soph. Elenc. xi. 1. Metap. lib. v.1. Scientific knowledge is possessed, when we know the necessary connexion be­ tween a thing and its cause.
Definition of Demonstration.
(Vide Ethics, vi. 3, 4.)WE think that we know each thing singly, (and not in a sophistical manner,* according to acci­ dent,) when we think that we know the cause on account of which a thing is, that it is the cause of that thing, and that the latter cannot subsist otherwise ;
wherefore it is evident that knowledge is a thing of this kind, for both those who do not, and those who do know, fancy, the former, that they in this manner possess knowledge, but those who know, possess it in reality, so that it is im­ possible that a thing of which there is know­ ledge simply should subsist in any other way.
1
Whether therefore there is any other mode of knowing we shall tell hereafter, but we say also that we obtain knowledge through demonstration, but I call demonstration a scien­ tific * syllogism, and I mean by scientific that ac­ cording to which, from our possessing it, we know.
If then to know is what we have laid down, it is necessary that demonstrative science should be from things true, first, immediate, more known * Syllog.

Now syllogism will subsist even without these, but demonstration will not, since it will not produce knowledge.
It is necessary then that they should 1.

1
More­ over they are prior and more known in two ways, for what is prior in nature, is not the same as that which is prior in regard to us, nor what is more known (simply) the same as what is more known to us.
Now I call things prior and more known to us, those which are nearer to sense, and things prior and more known simply, those which are * i. e. from sense.
more remote from sense;
and those things are most remote* which are especially universal,2 and those nearest which are singular, and these are mutually opposed.
That again is from things first, which is 5.

diate to which there is no other prior.
Now a proposition is one part of enunciation, one of one,4 dialectic indeed, which similarly assumes either (part of contradiction), but demonstrative which definitely (assumes) that one (part) is true.
Enunciation is either part t Vide ch. 10. Categories. of contradiction, and contradiction is an opposi­ tion † which has no medium in respect to itself.
But that part of contradiction (which declares) something, of somewhat, is affirmation, and that (which signi­ fies) something from somewhat is negation.*
Of an immediate syllogistic principle, I call that the thesis, which it is not possible to demonstrate, nor is it necessary that he should possess it, who in­ tends to learn any thing;
but what he who intends to learn any thing must necessarily possess, that I call an axiom,1 for there are certain things of * Ch. 6, on In­ terpretation.
4. Definition of thesis, consi­ dered by Pa­ cius and Waits as synonymous with πτίoσις.
5. Of axiom.
this kind, and in denominating these, we are accustomed generally to use this name.
But of thesis, that which re­ ceives either part of contradiction, as for instance, I mean that a certain thing is, or that it is not, is hypo­ thesis, but that which is without this, is definition.
For definition is a thesis, since the arithmetician 6.
Of hypothe­ sis.
lays down unity to be that which is indivisible, according to quantity, yet it is not hypothesis, since what unity is, and that unity is, are not the same thing.
Notwithstanding, since we must believe in and know a thing from possessing such a syllogism as we call demonstration, and this is, because these are so, of which syllogism consists-it is necessary not only to have a previous knowledge of the first, or all, or some things, but that they should be more known, for that on account of which any thing exists, always exists itself in a greater degree ;
for example, that on account of which we love is itself more beloved.
Hence if we know and believe on account of things first, we also know and believe those first things in a greater degree, because through them (we know and believe) things posterior.
A man however cannot believe more than what he knows, those things which he does not know, nor with respect to which he is better disposed than if he knew.

This however will happen, unless some one should previously know of those who give credence through demonstration, since it is more necessary to believe either in 7.

all or in certain first principles, than in the conclu­ sion.
It is not only however requisite that he who is to possess knowledge through demonstration, should know in a greater degree first principles, and believe rather in them than in the thing de­ monstrated, but also that nothing else should be more credible or more known to him than the opposites of the principles, from which a syllogism of contra-deception may consist, since it behoves him who possesses knowledge singly to be unchangeable.
21. Refutation of those who deny the exist­ ence of science.
To some, because it is necessary that first things should be known, science does not appear to exist, but to others to exist indeed, yet (they think) there are demonstrations of all things, neither of which opinions is true or necessary.
For those who suppose that knowledge does not subsist at all, these thick that we are to proceed to infinity as if we may not know things subse­ quent by things prior, of which there are no first, reasoning rightly, since it is impossible to penetrate infinites.
1
And if (they say) we are to stop, and there are principles, these are unknown, since there is no demonstration of them, which alone they say is to know scientifically;
but if it is not possible to know first things, neither can we know either simply or properly things which result from these, but by hypothesis, if these exist.
Others however assent with re­ spect to knowledge, for (they assert) that it is only through demonstration, but that nothing pre­ vents there being a demonstration of all things, 2. Also of those who declare all things capable of demonstra­ tion.
for demonstration may be effected in a circle, and (things be proved) from each other.
We on the contrary assert, that neither is all science demonstrative, but that the science of things immediate is indemonstrable.
And this is evidently necessary, for if it is requisite to know things prior, and from which demonstration subsists, but some time or other there is a stand made at things immediate, these must of necessity be indemonstrable.
This therefore we thus assert, and we say that there is not only science,.
but also a certain principle of science, by which we know terms.
2
But that it is impossible to demon­ strate in a circle simply is evident, since demon­ *

3. We cannot demonstrate in a circle things which do not reciprocate.
stration must consist of things prior and more known, as it is impossible that the same should be prior and posterior to the same, unless in a different way, as for instance, some things with reference to us, but others * Vide Whate­ ly, b. iv. ch. 1, also Metap. lib. ii. t i. e. of the on, see ch. IS.
simply in the manner in which induction makes known.*
If however this be so, to know simply will not be well defined, but it is two-fold,1 or the other demonstration is not simply so which is pro­ duced from things more known to us.†
Still there happens to those who assert there is demonstra­ tion in a circle, not only what has now been declared, but that they say nothing else than this is if it is, and in this manner we may easily demonstrate all things.
Nevertheless it is evi­ dent that this occurs, when three terms are laid down, for to assert that demonstration recurs through many or through few terms, or whether through few or through two, makes no 4.

difference.
For when A existing, B necessarily is, and from this last C, if A exists C will exist, if then, when A is, it is necessary that B should be, but this existing, A exists, (for this were to demonstrate in a circle,) let A be laid down in the place of C.
To say therefore that because B is A is, is equivalent to saying that C is, and this is to say that A existing C is, but C is the same as A, so that it happens that they who assert there is demonstration in a circle, say nothing else than that A is because A is, and thus we may easily demonstrate all things.
Neither however is this possible, except in those things which follow each other t Anal.

as properties:
from one thing however being laid down, it has been proved ‡ that there will never necessarily result something else, (I mean by one thing, neither one term, nor one thesis being laid down,) but from two first and least theses, it is possible (to infer necessarily something else), since we may syllogize.
If then A is consequent to B and to C, and these to each other, and to A, thus indeed it is possible to demonstrate all those things which are required from each other in the first figure, as we have shown in the books on Syllogism.*
It has also been shown t that in the other figures there is either not a syllogism,t or not one concerning the subjects assumed ;
1 but it is by no means possible to demonstrate in a circle * Anal.

those which do not reciprocate.
Hence, since there are but few such in demonstrations, it is evidently vain and impossi­ ble to say, that there is demonstration of things from each other, and that on this account universal demonstration is possible.
SINCE it is impossible that a thing, of which there is simply science, should have a various subsist­ ence, it will be also necessary that what we know 1.
Definition of demonstration.
should pertain to demonstrative science, and demonstrative science is that which we possess from possessing demon­ stration, hence a syllogism is a demonstration from neces­ sary (propositions).
We must comprehend then of what, and what kind (of propositions), demonstrations consist;
but first let us define what we mean by " of every," and “per se," and “universal."
I call that “of every, which is not in a cer­ tain thing, and in another certain thing is not, nor which is at one time, and not at another;
as if animal is predicated of every man, if it is truly 2.
Of predica­ tion " de om­ ni." TO Kara παντὸς.
said that this is a man, it is true also that he is an animal, and if now the one is true, so also is the other;
and in like manner, if a point is in every line.
Here is a proof, for when we are questioned as it were of every, we thus object, either if a thing is not present with a certain individual, or if it is not sometimes.
But I call those “per se which are inherent in (the definition of) what a thing 3. Of " τὸ καθ’ αὑτὸ,” ' per se.” * i. e. from line and point.
is,1 as line is in triangle, and point in line, (for the essence of them is from these,* and they are in the definition explaining what it is:
)2 also those things which are inherent in their attributes in the definition declaring what a thing is,3 as the straight and the curved are inherent in a line, and the odd and even in t As 3, 5, 7, &c. t As 9, i. e. a, 3, 3, &c. I i. e. a square number.
Taylor.
4. Of accidents.
συμβεβηκότα. (Cf. Phys. lib. ii , et Metap. lib. v.) number, and the primaryt and composite,t the equilateral § and the oblong :
4 and they are inhe­ rent in all these, in the definition declaring what a thing is, there indeed line, but here number.
In a similar manner, in other things, I say that such are per se inherent in each, but what are in neither way inherent (I call) accidents, as the being musical, or white in an animal.
Moreover, that which is not predicated of any other subject, as that which walks being something else, is that which walks, and is white, but essence and whatever things signify this particular thing, not being any thing else, are that which they are.
Now those which are not predicated of a subject, I call “per se," but those which are so predicated, I call accidents.
Again, after another manner, that which on account of itself is present with each thing is " per se," but that which is not on account of itself is an accident ;
5 thus it is an accident if while any body was walking it should lighten, for it did not lighten on account of his walking, but we say that it accidentally happened.
If, however, a thing is present on account of itself, it is per se, as if any one having his throat cut should die, and through the wound, because he will die in consequence of his throat being cut, but it did not accident­ ally happen that he whose throat was cut died.
Those therefore which are predicated in things which are simply objects of science per se, so as to be inherent in the things predicated,* or which are themselves inherent in subjects,† are on ac­ count of themselves, and from necessity, for it 5. " Per se," recapitulation.
* 1st mode.
t 2nd mode.
does not happen that they are not inherent either simply or as opposites, as the straight and the curved in a line, and the even or odd in number.
For a contrary is either privation or contradiction in the same genus, as that is even which is not odd in numbers, so far 6.
What is a contrary.
as it follows :
1 hence if it is requisite to affirm or deny, it is also necessary that those which are per se should be inherent.
Let then the expressions " of every " and " per se" be thus defined:
I call that universal, however, which is both predicated " of every " and " per se," and so far as the thing is.
2
Now it is evident that whatever are universal are inherent in things 7.
TO αὐτό, " quatenus ip­ sum," and TO καθολου, ex­ plained.
necessarily, but the expressions " per se," " and so far as it is," are the same;
as a point and straightness are per se pre­ sent in a line, for they are in it, in as far as it is a line, and two right angles in a triangle, so far as it is a triangle, for a triangle is per se equal to two right angles.
But universal is then present, when it is demonstrated of any casual and pri­ mary thing, as to possess two right angles is not universally inherent in figure, yet it is possible to demonstrate of a figure that it has two right angles, but not of any casual figure, nor does a demonstrator use any casual figure, for a square is in­ deed a figure, yet it has not angles equal to two right.
But any isosceles has angles equal to two right, yet not primarily, for triangle is prior.
Whatever therefore is casually first demonstrated to possess two right angles, or any thing else, in this first is the universal inherent, and the demonstration per se of this is universal, but of other things after a certain manner not per se, neither is it universally present in an isosceles, but extends farther.
WE ought not to be ignorant that frequently error arises, and that what is demonstrated is not primarily universal, in so far as the primarily universal appears to be demonstrated 1.
Sources of error in effect­ ing universal demonstration.
Example.
Now we are deceived by this mistake, when either nothing higher can be assumed, except the singular or singulars, or when something else can be assumed, but it wants a name in things differing in species, or when it happens to be as a whole in a part, of which the demonstration is made, for demonstration will happen to particulars, and will be of every individual, yet nevertheless it will not be the demonstration of this first universal.
Still I say the demonstration of this first, so far as it is this, when it is of the first universal.
If then any one should show that right lines do not meet, it may appear to be ( a proper) demonstration of this, because it is in all right lines, yet this is not so, since this does not arise from the lines being thus equal, but so far as they are in some way or other equal.
Also if a triangle should be no other than isosceles, so far as isosceles it may appear to be inherent:
alternate proportion also, so far as regards numbers and lines and solids and times (as was once shown separately) it is possi­ ble at least to be demonstrated of all by one demonstration, but inasmuch as all these, numbers, length, time, are not one deno­ minated thing, and differ from each other in species, they were assumed separately.
But now the demonstration is universal, for it is not in so far as they are lines or numbers, that it is inherent, but in so far as this thing which they suppose to be universally inherent.
For this reason neither if one should demonstrate each several triangle by one or another demon­ stration, that each has two right angles, equilateral, the scalene, and the isosceles separately, would he yet know that the triangle (itself) has angles equal to two right, except in a sophistical manner,* nor triangle universally, though there should be no other triangle besides * Vide supra.
these.
For he does not know it so far as it is triangle, nor does he know every triangle, except according to number, but not every, according to species, even if there be no one that he does not know.
1
When then does he not know uni­ versally, and when knows he simply?
It is clear that if there is the same essence of a triangle, and of an equilateral either of each or of all, he knows, †2 but if there is not the same, but different, and it is inherent so far as it is triangle, he does not know.
3
Whether t i. e. univers­ ally.
however is it inherent, so far as it is triangle, or so far as it is isosceles ?
And when, according to this, is it primary ?
And of what is the demonstration universally ?
It is evident that it then is, when, other things being taken away, it is in­ herent in the primary, thus two right angles will be inherent in a brazen isosceles triangle, when the being brazen and the being isosceles are taken away, but not if the figure or bound­ ary is taken away, nor if the primary are.
But what pri- mary ?
if indeed triangle (is taken away);
according to this it is inherent in others, and of this universally is the demon­ stration.
IF then demonstrative science is from necessary principles, (for what is scientifically known cannot subsist otherwise,) and those which are per se in­ herent are necessarily so in things, (for some are inherent in the definition of what a thing is, but others are they in the very nature of which the subjects are inherent, of which they are so predicated, that one of opposites is necessarily present,) it is evident that the demonstrative * i. e. of propo­ sitions per see syllogism will consist of certain things of this kind,* for every thing is either thus inherent, or according to accident, but accidents are not ne­ cessary.
Either therefore we must say this, or that demonstration is a necessary thing, if we lay down this principle, and that if de­ monstration is given that a thing cannot subsist otherwise, t i. e. the de­ monstrative.
wherefore the † syllogism must be from necessary (matter).
For it is possible without demonstra­ tion to syllogize from what are true, but we can­ not do so from things necessary, except by demonstration, for 2.
Proof of this.
this is now (the essence) of demonstration.
An indication also that demonstration is from things necessary is, that we thus object to those who think they de­ monstrate that (the conclusion) is not necessary, whether we think that the matter may altogether be otherwise possible, or 1.
Reply to objection.
on account of the argument.
Hence too the folly of those appears, who think they assume princi­ pIes rightly, if the proposition be probable and true, as the Sophists (assume) that to know is to possess knowledge.
2
For it is not the probable or improbable, which is the principle, but that which is primary of the genus about which the demonstration is made, nor is every thing true a- propriate.
But that it is necessary that the syl­ logism should consist of necessary things appears also from these;
for if he who cannot assign a reason why a thing is,.
when there is a demon­ stration, does not possess knowledge,† let A ‡ be 2nd proof. * The major.

The minor necessarily predicated of C, but B the medium through which it is demonstrated not of necessity, (in this case) he does not know the cause.
For this is not on account of the medium, for the latter may not exist, yet the conclusion is necessary.
Besides, if some one does not know, though he now possesses a reason, and is safe, the thing also be- 3. ing preserved, he not having forgotten it, neither did he be fore know it.
But the medium may perish if it is not neces­ sary, so that he, being safe, will have a reason, § the thing being preserved, and yet not know it, wherefore neither did he know it before.

if the medium is not destroyed, yet may possibly perish, that which happens will be possible and contingent, it is impossi­ ble however that one so circumstanced should know.
2When therefore the conclusion is from neces­ sity, there is nothing to prevent the medium through which the demonstration was made from being not necessary, since it is possible to syllogize the necessary even from things not necessary, just as we may the true from things not true.
Still 3. If the con­ clusion be ne­ cessary,the pre­ mises need not be so, but when the latter are so the conclusion must be neces­ sary.
when the medium is from necessity the conclusion is also from necessity, as the true (results) from the true always:
for let A be of necessity predicated of B, and this of C, then it is necessary that A should be with C.
But when the conclu­ sion is not necessary, neither possibly can the medium be ne­ cessary :
for let A be present with C, not of necessity, but let it be with B, and this with C of necessity;
A then will also be of necessity present with C, yet it was not supposed so.'
Since therefore what one knows demonstratively must be in­ herent of necessity, we must evidently obtain the demonstra­ tion through a necessary medium also, for otherwise, he will neither know why a thing exists, nor that it is necessary for it to exist, but he will either imagine not knowing, if he assumes what is not necessary as if it were necessary,3 or in like manner he will not imagine if he knows that * Cf. ch. 2. it is through media, and why it is through the immediate.
*3Of accidents however which are not per se after the man­ ner in which things per se have been defined, there is no do- monstrative science, since
It is not possible to de­ monstrate the conclusion of necessity, because accident may possibly not be present, for I speak of accident of this kind.'
Still some one may of.

perhaps doubt why we must make such investigations about these things, if it is not necessary that the conclusion should be, for it makes no difference if any one interrogating casual things * 2 should afterwards give the conclusion:
nevertheless we must interrogate not as if (the conclusion) were necessary on account of things interrogated, but because it is necessary for him * τὰ τυχόντα.
(Cf. Rhetoric, b. i. c. 5, and 10;
Phy.lib. ii.) who asserts these should assert this, and that he should speak truly if the things are truly inherent.
Since, however, whatever are inherent per se are necessarily inherent in every genus, and so far as each is, it is clear that scientific demonstra­ tions are of things " per se" inherent, and consist of such as these.
For accidents are not neces­ sary t wherefore it is not necessary to know the 5.

b. ii. c. 24. know through cause, wherefore the middle must " per se " be inherent in the third, and the first in the middle.
IT is not therefore possible to demonstrate pass­ ing from one genus to another, as, for instance, 1. Three things in demonstra­ tion, viz.
a do- monstrated conclusion, ax foms, and the subject genus.
* The attribute concluded of the subject. ( to demonstrate) a geometrical (problem) by arithmetic, for there are three things in demon­ strations, one the demonstrated conclusion, and this is that which is per se inherent in a certain genus.*
Another are axioms, but axioms are they from which demonstration is made, the third is the subject genus, whose properties and essential t Cf. Aquinas Opusc. 48, c. 11. t Vide ch. 11. accidents demonstration makes manifest. †
Now it is possible that the things from which demon­ stration consists may be the same,‡ but with those whose genus is different, as arithmetic and geo­ metry, we cannot adapt an arithmetical demonstration to the accidents of magnitudes, except magnitudes are numbers, and § Vide ch. 9. how this is possible to some shall be told here­ after.
§ But arithmetical demonstration always has the genus about which the demonstration (is conversant), and others in like manner, so that it is either simply neces­ sary that there should be the same genus, or in a certain re­ Spect,1 if demonstration is about to be transferred;
but that 2.
That the ex­ tremes and media must be of the same genus.
it is otherwise impossible is evident, for the ex­ tremes and the middles must necessarily be of the same genus, since if they are not per se, they will be accidents.
On this account we cannot by geometry demonstrate that there is one science of contra­ ries, nor that two cubes make one cube,2 neither can any science (demonstrate) what belongs to any science, but such as are so related to each other as to be the one under the other, for instance, optics to geometry, and harmonics to arithmetic.
Nor if any thing is inherent in lines not so far as they are lines, nor as they are from proper principles, as if a straight line is the most beautiful of lines, or if it is contrary to circumference, for these things are inherent not by reason of their proper genus, but in so far as they have something common.
IT is also evident that if the propositions of which a syllogism consists are universal, the conclusion of such a demonstration.
and in short of the demonstration of itself, must necessarily be perpetual.
There is not then either demon­ stration, nor in short science of corruptible na­ tures, but so as by accident, because there is not universal belonging to it, but sometimes, and after a certain manner.
But when there is such, it is necessary that one proposition should not be uni­ versal, and that it should be corruptible, cor- 1.
That there is no demon­ stration nor de­ finition " per se " of mutable natures, be­ cause of the universal being non-existent.
ruptible indeed, because the conclusion will be so if the pro­ position is so, and not universal, because one of those things of which it is predicated will be, and another will not be, 1 hence it is not possible to conclude universally, but that it is now.
It is the same in the case of definitions, since definition is either the principle of demonstration, or demonstration.
differing in the position (of the terms), or a certain conclusion of demonstration.
The demonstrations and sciences however of things frequently occurrent, as of the eclipse of the moon, evidently always exist, so far as they are such, but so far as they are not always, they are particular,2 and as in an eclipse, so also is it in other things.
SINCE however it is evident that we cannot de­ monstrate each thing except from its own prin­ 1.
That true demonstration only results from principles appropriate to the subject of demonstration:
the terms must either be homo­ geneous, or from two ge­ nera, of which one is contain­ ed in the other.
ciples, if what is to be demonstrated is inherent in a subject so far as the subject is that (which it is), to have a scientific knowledge of that thing is not this, if it should be demonstrated from true, indemonstrable, and immediate (propositions ).
1
For we may so demonstrate possibly, as Bryso did, the quadrature of the circle, since such rea­ sonings prove through something common, that which is inherent in another thing, hence these arguments are adapted to other things not of the same genus.
2
Wherefore that thing would not be scientifically known, as far as it is such, but from accident, for otherwise the demonstration would not be adapted also to another genus.
We know however each thing not accidentally when we know it according to that, after which it is inherent from * Cf. Eth.b. vi. ch. 3. t The possession of three angles equal to two right.
t Of triangle.
§ πάθος, or property, like ὶδίον here.
|| i. e. with the extremes, sub­ ject, and pro­ perty.
principles which are those of that thing, so far as it is that thing ;
3* as that a thing has angles equal to two right angles, in which the thing spoken off is essentially inherent from the prin­ ciples of this thing.
t
Hence if that§ is essen­ tially inherent in what it is inherent, it is neces­ sary that the middle should be in the same affinity,|| but if not, yet it will be as harmonics are proved through an arithmetical principle.
4
Such things however are demonstrated after a similar manner, yet they differ, 1 for that they are, is part of another science,* (for the subject genus is another,†) but why they are, is a province of a superior science, of which they are the essential qualities.
Hence * Inferior sci­ ence.
t i. e. differs from the sub­ ject of superior science.
from these things also it is apparent that we cannot demon­ strate each thing simply, but from its proper principles, and the principles of these ‡ have something common.
If then this is evident, it is also clear that it is impossible to demonstrate the proper principles of each thing, for they will be the principles of all things, and the science of them the mistress of all (sciences):

So that if he knows more, he knows also most, and if that be science, it is also more, and most of all such.
Demonstration however is not suitable to another genus, except as we have said, geometrical to me­ chanical or optical, and arithmetical to harmonical demon­ strations.
Nevertheless it is difficult to know whether a man possesses knowledge or not, since it is hard to ascertain if we know from the principles of each thing or not, which indeed constitutes know-

We think however that we know, if we have got a syllogism from certain primary truths, but it is not so, since it is necessary that they § should be of a kindred nature with the primary.
§ i. e. the con­ clusions with principles.
1. Definition of principles, (ἀρχαὶ,) their existence to be assumed.
Ex­ ample.t Vide ch. 2.
I CALL those principles in each genus, the exist­ ence of which it is impossible to demonstrate.
What then first things,† and such as result from these signify, is assumed, but as to principles, we must assume that they are, but demonstrate the rest, as what unity is, or what the straight and a triangle are ;
it is necessary however to assume that unity and magnitude exist, but to demonstrate the other things.
12.
What are peculiartoeach science, and what common.
Of those which are employed in demonstrative sciences, some are peculiar to each science, but others are common, and common according to analogy, since each is useful, so far as it is in the genus under science.
The peculiar indeed are such as, that a line is a thing of this kind, and that the straight is, but the common are, as that if equals be taken from equals the re­ mainders are equal.
Now each of these is sufficient, so far as it is in the genus, for (a geometrician) will effect the same, though he should not assume of all, but in magnitudes alone, and the arithmetician in respect of numbers2 (alone).
Proper principles, again, are those which are assumed to be, and about which science considers whatever are inherent per se, as arithmetic assumes unities, and geometry points and lines, for they assume that these are, t They assume that they are, and what they are.
and that they are this particular thing.t
But the essential properties of these, what each signifies, they assume, as arithmetic, what the odd is, or the even, or a square, or a cube;
and geometry, what is not proportionate, or what is to be broken, or to in­ cline ;
but that they are, they demonstrate through things common, * and from those which have been demonstrated.†
So also astronomy, for all de­ monstrative science is conversant with three things, those which are laid down as existing, and these are the genus,‡ (the essential properties of which the science considers,) and common things called axioms, from which as primaries they demonstrate;
and thirdly, the affections, § the signification of each of which the demon­ strator assumes.
1
There is nothing however to prevent certain sciencesoverlooking some of these, * i. e. princi- Pies.

as if the genus is not supposed to be, if it be manifest2 that it exists, (for it is not similarly manifest that number is, as that the cold and hot are,) and if (the science) does not assume what the affections signify, if they are evident, as neither does it assume what things common signify, (as what it is) to take away equals from equals, because it is known;
nevertheless these things are naturally three, viz.
that about which demon­ stration is employed, the things demonstrated, and the prin­ ciples from which they are.
Neither however hypothesis nor postulate is that which it is necessary should exist per se, and be necessarily seen,|| for demonstration does not belong to external speech, but to what is in the soul,3 since neither does syllogism.
For it is always possible to object to external discourse, 4. Of the dif­ ference be­ tween ἀξιώμα, ὐπόθεσις, and αἲτημα.
H Vide Mansel, p. 38, App. Waitz in loco but not always to internal.
Whatever things then, being de.
monstrable, a man assumes without demonstration, these, if he assumes what appear probable to the learner, he supposes, and this is not an hypothesis simply, but with reference to the learner alone;
but if, there being no inherent opinion, or when a contrary is inherent, the demonstrator assumes, he requires the same thing to be granted to him.
And in this hypothesis and postulate differ, for postulate is any thing sub-contrary to the opinion of the learner, which though demonstrable a man assumes, and uses without demonstration.
Definitions then are not hypotheses, (for they are not asserted to be or not to be,) but hypothe­ ses are in propositions.
Now it is only necessary that definitions should be understood, but this is not hypothe­ sis, except some one should say that the verb to hear is hypo­ thesis.
But they are hypotheses, from the existence of which, in that they are, the conclusion is produced.
Neither does the geometrician suppose falsities, as some say, who assert, that it is not right to use a false (principle), but that the geometrician does so, when he calls a line a foot long when it is not so, or the line which he describes a straight line when it is not straight.
The geometrician indeed concludes nothing from the lines being so and so, as he has said, but concludes those, which are manifested through these (symbols).
More­ over postulate and every hypothesis are either as a whole or as in a part, but definitions are neither of these.

the existence of demonstration, 1 but it is necessary truly to predicate one thing of the many, for there will not be the uni­ versal unless this be so, and if there be not an universal, there will not be a medium, so that neither will there be a demonstration.
It is essential then that there should be one and the same thing, which is not equivocal in respect of many :

The cause however is, that the first is not only predicated of the middle, but also of something else, in consequence of its being common to many, so that neither if the middle be that thing itself, or not that thing, does it make any difference in respect to the conclu­ sion.

‡IF syllogistic interrogation is the same as a pro­ position of contradiction,1 but there are proposi­ tions in each science, from which the syllogism which belongs to each consists, there will be a certain scientific interrogation, from which the syllogism,* which is appropriate to each science, is drawn.

These t also must be discussed from geometrical principles and conclu­ sions,‡ but the discussion of principles is not to be carried on by the geometrician so far as he is such;
likewise with other sciences.
Neither is every one who possesses science to be interrogated with every question, nor is every question about t

each to be answered, but those which are defined about the science.
It is evident then that he does well, who disputes with a geometrician thus, so far as he is such, if he demon­ strate any thing from these principles, but if not, he will not do well.
Again, it is clear that neither does he confute the geometrician except by accident, so that there cannot be a discussion of geometry by those who are ignorant of geometry, since the bad reasoner will escape detection, and it is the same with other sciences.

In mathematics however there is not in like manner a paralogism, because the middle is always two-fold,3 for (one thing) is predicated of every individual of this, and this again of another every, but the predicate is not called universal ;

What pertain however to mathematics, are rather con­ verted, because they take nothing accidental, (and in this they differ from dialectical subjects,) but definitions.
5. Mathemati­ cal demonstra­ tions rarely prove the same, by many media.
Yet they are increased, not through media, but through additional assumption, as A of B, this of C, this again of D, and so on to infinity.

A two-fold difference if the syllogism beNow there is a difference between knowing that a thing is, and why it is, first in the same science, and in this in two ways, the one, if the syllogism is not formed through things immediate, (since the primary cause is not assumed, but the science of the why has respect to the first cause,) but the other if it is through things immediate not through things imme­ diate :
next, if it be, but not through cause, in the same science.
indeed, yet not through the cause, but through that which is more known of the things, which reciprocated Now nothing prevents that which is not a cause being sometimes more known amongst things which are mutually predicated, so that demonstration shall accrue through this, as that the planets are near, because they do not twinkle.
Let C be the planets, B not to twinkle, A to be near, B therefore is truly predii cated of C, since the planets do not twinkle, A also of B, for what does not twinkle is near, but this * may be assumed by induction or by sensed It is neces­ * i. e. the two propositions.
* Example (I.) of the ὄrt.
sary then that A should be present with C, so that it is demonstrated that the planets are near..
This syllogism then is not of the " why," but oi the "that" (a thing is), for the planets are not near because they do not twinkle, but they do not twinkle because they are near.
It happens indeed that the one may be proved through the other, and the demonstration will be of the " why," as let C be the planets, B to be near, A not to twinkle, B then is t Example (2.) of the διότι.
present with C, so that A not to twinkle will be with C.t
It is also a syllogism of the " why," for the first cause was assumed.
Again, as they show the moon to be spherical through increments (of light), for if what is thus increased be spherical, and the moon is in­ creased, it is evident that the moon is spherical, thus then a t i. e. the form­ er middle be­ comes the ma­ jor, and the former major becomes the middle.
§ Example (3.) 2. Where the media do not reciprocate the ὄτι is demon­ strated, also where the mid­ dle is external­ ly placed.
syllogism of the "that" is produced, but if the middle is placed contrarily,‡ there is a syllogism of the " why," for it is not spherical on account of the increments, but from being spherical she receives such increments:
let the moon be C, spherical B, increase A.§
Where again the media do not reciprocate,1 and what is not the cause is more known, the "that" is indeed demonstrated, but not the " why ;
" further, where the middle is placed externally,2 for in these the demonstration is of the " that," and not of the "why," as the cause is not assigned.
For example, why does not a wall breathe ?
because it is not an animal, for if this was the cause of its not breathing, it would be necessary that animal should be the cause of its breathing, since if negation is the cause of a thing not being, affirmation is the cause of its being, thus if the disproportion of hot and cold is the cause of not being well, the proportion of these is the cause of be­ ing well.
Likewise if affirmation is the cause of being, nega­ tion is the cause of not being, but in things which have been thus explained, what has been stated does not occur, for not every animal respires.
1
A syllogism of such a cause is never­ theless produced in the middle figure, for example, let A be animal, B to respire, C a wall, A then is present with every B, (for whatever respires is animal,) but with no C, so that neither is B present with any C, wherefore a wall does not respire.*
Such causes however resemble things spoken hyperbolically,2 and this is, when we turn * Example (4.) aside to speak of the middle, which is more widely extended, as for instance, that saying of Anacharsis, that amongst the Scythians there are no pipers, since neither are there any vines.
3
As to the same science then, and the position of the media, these are the differences between a syllogism of, that a thing is, and of why it is, but in another respect the why differs from the that, because each is beheld in a different science.
Now such are those things which so subsist with re­ ference to each other, as that the one is under the 3.

and harmony is both mathematical and of.

For here to know that a thing is, is the province of those who ex­ ercise the sense, but to know why it is, belongs to mathematicians, since these possess the demon­ strations of causes, and often are ignorant of the that, as they who contemplating universals, fre­ quently are ignorant of singulars from want of observation.

Mathemati­ cal demonstra-OF the figures, the first is especially adapted to science, for both the mathematical sciences carry out their demonstrations by this, as arithmetic, geometry, optics, and nearly, so to speak, whatso­ ever sciences investigate the " why," since either entirely or for the most part, and in most sciences, the syllogism of the why is through this figure.
Wherefore also, on this account, it will be espe­ cially adapted to science, for it is the highest pro­ perty of knowledge to contemplate the " why ;

but the what a thing is belongs to universals, for man is not a biped animal in a certain respect.

shown - if both also are in a certain whole, but that it is possible that B may not be in the whole in which A is, or again A in which B is, is evi­ dent from those co-ordinations t which do not in­ terchange.
1
For if none of those, which are in the class A C D, is predicated of any of those in B E F, but A is in the whole of H, which is co-arranged with it, it is ‡ Example (1.)
2. § This prop., B is not A, is in­ demonstrable.
evident that B will not be in H, for otherwise the co-ordinates would intermingle.
tLikewise also if B is in a certain whole, but if neither is in any whole, and A is not present with B, it is necessary that it should not be present individually, §for if there shall be a certain mid­ dle, one of them must necessarily be in a certain whole, for there will be a syllogism either in the first, or in the middle figure.
If then it is in the first, B will be in a certain whole, (for it is necessary that the proposition in regard to this || i. e. A or B. IT Both prop.

should be affirmative, but if in the middle figure either of them || may be (in the whole), for the negative being joined to both,¶ there is a syllo­ gism,* but there will not be when both the pro­ positions are negative.
It is manifestly possible then, that one thing may not be individually present with another, also when, and how this may happen, we have shown.t Cf. ch. 12 ;
also Eth. b. iUi. ch. 1.THE ignorance t which is denominated not ac­ cording to negation, but according to disposition.

for it hap-

pens either when one simply apprehends the being present, or not being present, or when he obtains this opinion through syllogism:
of simple opinion, then, the deception is simple, but of that which is through syllogism, it is manifold.
For let A not be present with any B individually, if then A is concluded to be present with B, assuming C as the middle, a person will be deceived through syllogism.
Hence it is possible that both propositions may be false, but it is also possible that only one may be so, for if neither A is present with any C, nor C with any B, but each proposition is taken contrary, both will be false.
But it may be that C so subsists with reference to A and B, as neither to be under A nor universally (present) with B, for it is impossible that B should be in a certain whole, since it was said that A is not primarily present with it;
but A need not be universally present with all beings, so that both propositions are false.
2. Examples of affirmative de­ ception.
Nevertheless, we may assume one proposition as true, not either of them casually, but the proposition A C, for the pro­ position C B will be always false, because B is in none;
but A C may be (true), for instance, if A is present individually, both with C and B, for when the same thing is primarily pre­ dicated of many things, neither will be predicated of neither ;
it makes no difference however if it (A) be not individually present with it (C).
The deception then of being present, is by these and in this way only, (for there was not a syllo­ gism of being present in another figure,*) but the deception of not being present with, is in the first and middle figure.
t
Let us first then declare in how many ways it occurs in the first, and under what propositional circumstances.
It may then happen when both propositions are false, e. g. if A is present individually with C and B, for if A 3.

But (deception) is possible, when one proposition is false, and either of them casually;
for it is possible that A C may be true, but C B false;
A C true, because A is not present with all beings, but C B false.
because it is impossible that C should be with B, with * Because A is with some C, vis. with B contained un­ der C. t Vide An. Prior i. ch. 2—4. t A. § c. E i. e. partially.

nothing of which A is present;
for otherwise the proposition A C will be no longer true,­ at the same time, if both are true, the conclusion also will be true.†
But it is also possible that C B may be true, when the other proposition is false, as if B is in C and in A, for one must ne­ cessarily be under the other,§ so that if A should be assumed present with no C, the proposition will be false. ||
It is clear then, that when one proposition is false, and also when both are, the syllogism will be false.
¶In the middle figure, however, it is not possible that both propositions should be wholly false, for when A is present with every B, it will be impossible to assume *

any thing,.
which is present with every individual of the one, but with no individual of the other ;
t but we must so assume the propositions that the (middle) may be present with one (extreme), and not be present with the other, if indeed there is to be a syllogism. ‡
If then, when they are thus assumed, they are false, it is clear that, when taken contrarily, they will subsist vice versa, but this is impossible.
1
Still there is nothing to prevent each being partly false, as if C is with A, and with a certain B;
for if it should be assumed present with every A, but with no B, both propositions in­ deed would be false, yet not wholly, but partially.
The same § So that the neg. prop. is major. || Because B is species of A. will occur when the negative is placed vice versa.
§ But it is possible that one proposition, and either of.
them, may be false, for what is present with every A, will be also with B,ll if then C is as­ sumed present with the whole of A, but not pre­ sent with the whole of B, C A will be true, but the proposi­ tion C B false.
Again, what is present with no B, will not be present with every A;
for if with A, it would also be with B, but it was not present;
if then C should be assumed pre­ sent with the whole of A, but with no B, the proposition C B will be true, but the other false.*
The same will happen if the negative is transposed, † for what is in no A, will neither be in any B ;
if then C is assumed not present with the whole of A, * Either wholly or partially, t If the nega­ tive becomes the major.
but present with the whole of B, the proposition A C will be true, but the other false.‡

with no A;
for it is necessary, if it is with every B, that it should be also with a certain A;
if then C is assumed pre­ sent with every B, but with no A, the proposition C B will be indeed true, but C A false.
§ Hence, it is evident that when both propositions are false, f Either wholly or partially.
and when one only is so, there will be a syllogism deceptive in individuals.
1IN those which are not individually present,|| or which are not present, when a syllogism of the false is produced through an appropriate medium, both propositions cannot be false, but only the major.
But I mean by an appropriate medium, that through which there is a syllogism of contra­ diction.¶
For let A be with B through the me­ dium of C, since then we must take C B as af­ firmative, if there is to be a syllogism, it is clear that this will be always true, for it is not con­ verted.*
A C, on the other hand, will be false, for when this is converted, a contrary syllogism 1. Syllogism of the false pro­ duced in medi­ ates, when the major is false. || But by a medium.

arises.2
So also if the middle is assumed from another affinity, as for instance, if D is in the whole of A, and is predicated of every B, for the proposition D B must necessarily remain,3 but the other proposition must be converted,4 so that the one ( the minor) will be always true, but the other (the major) always false.
Deception also of this kind is almost the same I.
Case of both propositions being false.
as that which is through an appropriate medium, but if the syllogism should not be through an ap­ propriate medium,1 when indeed the middle is under A, but is present with no B, it is necessary that both propositions should be false.
For the propositions must be assumed contrary to the way in which they subsist, if a syl­ logism is to be formed,2 for when they are thus assumed both are false, as if A is with the whole of D, but D present with no B, for when these are converted, there will be a syllogism, and both propositions will be false.
When however the me­ dium is not under A, for instance, D, A D will be true, but * Vide An. Prior, b. i. ch. 2—4. 3. Both prop. cannot be wholly false in the middle figure, when deception is produced.
t Vide pre­ ceding chapter.
D B false, for A D is true, because D was not in A, but D B false, because if it were true the con­ clusion also would be true,* but it was false.
Through the middle figure however, when de­ ception is produced, it is impossible that both propositions should be wholly false, (for when B is under A, it is possible for nothing to be pre­ sent with the whole of the one, but with nothing of the other, as has been observed before, †) but one proposition may be false whichever may hap­ pen.
For if C is with A and with B, if it be assumed pre­ sent with A, but not present with B, the proposition A C will be true, but the other false;
again, if C be assumed present with B, but with no A, the proposition C B will be true, but the other false.
4. Affirmative deception.

that both should be false, for C B must necessarily remain, § if there is to be a syllogism,|| as was also observed before.
Wherefore C A will be always false, for it is this which is converted.¶
Likewise also, if the middle be taken from another class, as was ob­ served in negative deception, for the proposition D B must of necessity remain, but A D be converted, and the decep­ tion is the same as the former.
But when it is not through an appropriate medium, if D be under A, this.
indeed will be true, but the other † false, for A may possibly be present with many things which * The major.

If however D is not under A, this t will evidently be always false, (for it is as­ sumed affirmative for D B may be as well true as ‡ The major.
false, since nothing prevents
A being present with no D, but D with every B, as animal with (no) science, but science with (all) music.
Again, (nothing prevents)
A from being present with no D, and D with no B:
it is clear then that when the medium is not under A, both propositions, and either of them, as it may happen, may be false.
In how many ways then, and through what, syllogistic de­ ceptions are possible, both in things immediate, and in those which are demonstrated, has been shown.
IT is clear, also, that if any sense be deficient, a certain science must be also deficient, which we cannot possess, since we learn either by induction or by demonstration.
Now demonstration is from universals, but induction from particulars, it is impossible however to investigate universals, ex­ cept through induction, since things which are said to be from abstraction, will be known through induction;
2 if any one desires to make it ap-
1. Universals from which de­ monstration proceeds, de­ pend upon in­ duction, the latter upon sense.

Rhet. b. i. ch. 2, and b. ii. ch. 23.
parent that some things are present with each genus, although they are not separable, so far as each is such a thing.
Never­ theless, it is impossible for those who have not sense to make an induction, for sense is conversant with singulars, as the science of them cannot be received, since neither (can it be obtained) from universals without induction, nor through in­ duction without sense.
EVERY syllogism consists of three terms, and one indeed is able to demonstrate that A is with C from its being present with B, and this last with C, but the other is negative, having one proposition (to the effect) that one certain thing is in another, but the other proposition (to the effect) that it is not with it.
Now it is clear, that the same are principles, and what are called hypotheses, since it is necessary to demon­ strate by thus assuming these, 1 e. g. that A is present with C through B, and again, that A is with B through another me-
1. By those who syllogize κατὰ δόξαν it is to be consider­ dium, and that B is with C in like manner.
By those then who syllogize according to opinion only, and dialectically, this alone it is clear must be considered, viz.
whether the syllogism is produced from propositions as probable as possible, so that if there is in reality a medium between A and B, but it does not appear, he who syllogizes through ed whether the syllogisms arise from pro­ positions espe­ cially probable.
this, will have syllogized dialectically.
But as to truth, it be­ hoves us to make our observations from things inherent:
1 it happens thus.
Since there is that, which is itself predicated of something else, not according to accident,.
but I mean by according to accident, as we say some­ * Cf. ch. 6. times, that that white thing is a man, not similarly saying, that a man is a white thing, for man not being any thing else is white, but it is a white thing, because it happens to a man to be white:

between.
Again, also let E be present in like manner with F, and this with B, is it then necessary that this should stop, or is it possible to proceed to infinity?
3
Once more, if nothing is predicated of A per se, but A is primarily present with H, nothing prior intervening, and H with G, and this with B, is it necessary also that this should stop, or can this likewise go on to infinity?
4
Now this so much differs from the former, that the one is, whether it is possible by beginning from a thing of that kind,t which is present with nothing else, but something else present with it, to proceed upward to infinity;
but the other is, beginning from that 2.

and again, t So Waitz and Bekker;

with something else prior to this, as whether (the medium is) H, which is present with every G;
for in these also, either those are infinite with which first they are t present, or the progression stops.
The same thing however does not occur in things which are convertible, since in those which are mutually predicated of each other, there is nothing of which first or last a thing is predi­ cate;
for in this respect all things subsist similarly with respect to all, whether those are infinite, which are predi­ §

cate of the same, or whether both § subjects of doubt are infinite, except that the conversion can­ not be similarly made;
but the one is as accident, but the other as predication.
3THAT media cannot be infinite, if the predica­ tions, both downward and upward, stop, is evi­ dent :
I call indeed the predication upward, which tends to the more universal, but the downward that which proceeds to the particular.
For if 1.

ries, there are infinite attributes before we arrive at A.
Hence, if these things are impossible,!
it is also impos­ sible that there should be infinite media between A and F ;
for it does not signify if a man should say that some things of A B F‡ so mutually ad­ here, as that there is nothing intermediate, but that others cannot be assumed.

With regard to the other t however it is clear, that if it is not present with something else prior, for instance, with D, it will be requisite that this (D) should be present with every B.§

But the third mode was if A indeed is present with every B, but C is not present, C will not be present with every A ;
4 again, this will be demonstrated either through the above-mentioned modes,* or in a similar manner, † in those modes the progression stops, ‡ but if thus, it will again be assumed that B is present with E, with every individual of which C is not pre­ sent.

That is, a ne­ gative prop.
Nevertheless, it appears plain, that if it should not be de­ monstrated in one way, but in all, at one time from the first figure, at another from the second or the third, that thus also the progression will stop, for the ways are finite,­ but it is necessary that finite things being finitely assumed should be all of them finite.,
That in negation then the progression stops, if it does so in affirmation, is clear, t but that it must stop in them ‡ is thus manifest to those who consider logically.
1IN things predicated therefore as to what a thing is, this is clear, for if it is possible to define, or if the very nature of a thing may be known, but infinites cannot be passed through, it is necessary that those things should be finite which are pre­ dicated with respect to what a thing is.
We 1. Of predica­ tions, as to what a thing is, there cannot be infinity—a difference of predication pointed out.
must however speak universally thus:
a white thing we may truly say walks, also that that great thing is wood;
more­ over, that the wood is great, and that the man walks, yet there is a difference between speaking in this way and in that.
For when I say that that white thing is wood, then 1 say that what happens to be white is wood, but what is white is not, as it were, a subject to wood, since neither being white, nor what is a certain white thing, became wood, so that it is not (wood) except from accident.
But when I say that the wood is *

white, I do not say that something else is white, but it happens to that- to be wood, (as when I say that a musician is white, for then I mean that the man is white, to whom it happens to be a musician, but wood is the subject which became (white), not being any thing else than what is wood, or a certain piece of wood.
If † As the wood is white. ‡
As that which is white is wood.
Cf. Met. lib. v. Phy. lib. ii.
indeed it is necessary to assign names, let speak­ ing in this way † be to predicate, but in that way t be either by no means to predicate, or to predicate indeed, not simply, but according to accident.
That which is predicated is as white, but that of which it is predicated as wood;
now let it be sup­ posed that the predicate is always spoken of what it is predi­ cated of simply, and not according to accident, for thus demon­ strations demonstrate.
Therefore when one thing is predi­ cated of one, it will be predicated either in respect of what a thing is, or that it is a quality, or a quantity, or a relative, or an agent, or a patient, or that it is some where, or at some time.
2.
True predi­ cations either define what the subject is, or are accidents.
Moreover, those which signify substance, sig­ nify that the thing of which they are predicated, is that which it is, or something belonging to it, but whatever do not signify substance, but are predicated of another subject, which is neither the thing itself, nor something belonging to it, are accidents, as white is pre­ dicated of man, since man is neither white, nor any thing which belongs to white, but is perhaps animal, for man is that which is a certain animal.
Such as do not signify sub­ stance it is necessary should be predicated of a certain sub­ ject, and not be something white, which is white, not being any thing else.
For, farewell to ideas, for they are mere § Cf. ch. 11. prattlings,§ and if they exist, are nothing to the subject, since demonstrations are not about such things.
1Again, if this is not a quality of this, and that of this, neither a quality of a quality, it is impos- 2.
sible that they should be thus mutually predicated of each other, still they may possibly be truly said, but cannot truly be mutually predicated.
For will they be predicated as sub­ stance, as being either the genus or the difference of what is predicated ?
It has been shown that these will not be infinite, neither in a descending nor in an ascending progression, as for instance, man is a- biped, this an animal, this something else ;
neither can animal be predicated of man, this of Callias, this of something else,.
in respect to what a thing is.
For we may define the whole of this to be substance, but we cannot penetrate infinites by perception, † wherefore neither are there infinites upwards or downwards, for we cannot define that * i. e. in an in­ finite series.
Cf. Phys. lib. iii. t
Hence they are incapable of definition.
of which infinites are predicated.
They will not indeed be mutually predicated of each other as genera, for genus would be a part itself, neither will quality nor any of the other cate­ gories be (mutually) predicated, except by accident, for all these are accidents, and are predicated of sub­ stances.
But neither will there be infinites in ascending series,t for of each thing, that is predi­ cated, which signifies either a certain quality, or a certain quantity, or something of this kind, or those which are in the substance, but these are finite, and the genera of the categories are finite, 3. In either case there can­ not be an infi­ nite series shown from the nature of cate­ gory. ‡
There will not be infinite accidents.
since (a category) is either quality, or quantity, or relation, or action, or passion, or where, or when.
One thing is however supposed to be predicated of one,§ but those not to be mutually predicated which do not signify what a thing is, since all these are accidents, but some are per se, others after a different manner, § i. e. proposi­ tions are not multiplied by theconjunction of attributes.
and we say all these are predicated of a certain subject, but that accident is not a certain subject, for we do not as­ sume any thing of this kind to be, which not being any thing, else, is said to be what it is said to be, but we say that it is predicated of something else, and certain other things of another thing.
1
Neither then can one thing be predicated of one (infinitely) upwards, nor downwards, for those of which accidents are predicated, are such as are contained in the sub­ * A last sub­ ject, e. g. D. t i. e. immedi­ ately. ‡ As C. § As B. || A first predi­ cate, as A. ¶ Prior to B. * So that there is nothing prior to A.

Both these indeed and accidents are ascending, and both are not infinite, wherefore it is neces­ sary that there should be something - of which primarily t something t is predicated, and some­ thing else § of this, also that this should stop, and that there should be something || which is neither predicated of another prior thing,¶ nor another prior thing of it.
-This then is said to be one mode of demon­ stration, but there is another besides, if there is a demonstration of those of which certain things are previously predicated, but of what there is demonstration, it is not possible to be better affected towards them than to know them, nor can we know without demon­ t

Still if this † becomes known through these,t but these we do not know, nor are better affected towards them than if we knew them, neither shall we obtain scientific knowledge of that which becomes known through these.
If then it is pos­ sible to know any thing simply through demonstration, and § Cf. Prior An. ii. ch. 18. 5. If there is an infinity of predication, demonstration cannot exist.
not from certain things, nor from hypothesis, §it is necessary that the intermediate predications should stop ;
for if they do not stop, but there is always something above what is assumed, there will be a demonstration of all things, so that if we cannot pass through infinites, we shall not know by demonstration those things of which there is de­ monstration.
If then we are not better affected towards them than if we knew them, it will be impossible to know any thing by demonstration simply, but by hy­ pothesis.
1Logically then from these things a person may believe about what has been said, but analyti­ cally2 it is more concisely manifest thus, that there cannot be infinite predicates in demonstra­ tive sciences, the subject of the present treatise, either in an ascending or descending series.

5. The same proved analyti­ cally from the nature of those things which are predicated καθ'αὺτά.
demonstration is of such things as are essentially present with things, essentially in two ways, both such as are in them in respect of what a thing is, and those in which the things themselves are inherent in respect of what a thing is, thus the odd in number which indeed is inherent in number, but number itself is inherent in the definition of it,† again also, multitude or the divisible is inherent in the definition of number.
Still neither of t i. e. of the odd.
these can be infinites, nor as the odd is predicated of number, for again there will be something else in the odd,‡ in which § being inherent, || (the odd) would be inherent, and if this be so, number will be first inherent in those things which are inherent in it.
If then such infinites cannot be inherent in the one,¶ neither will there be infinites in ascend­ ing series.
Still it is necessary that all should be inherent in the first,.
for example, in number, and number in them,† so that they will recipro­ cate, but not be more widely extensive.
Neither are those infinite which are inherent in the defi­ nition of a thing,f for if they were, we could not define, so that if all predicates are predicated per t e. g. inequal­ ity.

Case where no common ground of in­ herency sub­ sists.¶
As C of D.* Some term in common predicated of C and D.FROM what has been shown it appears plain that if one and the same thing is inherent in two, for instance, A in C and in D, when one is not pre­ dicated of the other,¶ either not at all or not uni­ versally, then it is not always inherent according to something common..
Thus to the isosceles and to the scalene triangle, the possession of an­ gles equal to two right, is inherent according to something common, † for it is inherent so far as each is a certain figure,‡ and not so far as it is something else.§
This however is not always the case, for let B be that according to which A is inherent in C D, then it is evident1 that B is also inherent in C, and in D, according to something else com­ mon,* and that also† according to something else, ‡ so that between two terms, § infinite terms may be inserted, but this is impossible.||

it is moreover requisite that the terms should be in the same genus, and from the same individuals, since that which is common will be of those which are essentially inherent, for it is im­ possible to transfer things which are demonstrated from one genus to another.
¶But it is also manifest that when A is with B, if there is a certain middle, we may show that B is with A, and the elements of this * are these and whatever are media, for immediate propositions, either all of them, or those which are universal, are elements.

In syllogisms then, which de­ monstrate the being inherent, nothing falls beyond (the middle), but in negatives here,|| nothing falls external of that which ought to be inherent,5' as if A is not present with B through C.

gative, it is questioned which is preferable, likewise also about what is called direct demonstration, and that which leads to the impossible.
Let us first then consider the uni­ versal and the particular, and having explained this, speak of what is called direct demonstration, and that to the impossible.
Perhaps then to some considering the matter in this way, the particular may appear the better, for if that demonstration is preferable, by which we obtain better knowledge, for this is the excel-
2. Reasons why particular demonstration may appear eligible.
lence of demonstration, but we know each thing better when we know it per se, than when through something else, (as we know Coriscus is a musician, when we know that Coriscus is a musician rather than when we know that a man is a musi­ cian, and likewise in other things,) but the universal demon­ strates because a thing is something else, not because it is that which it is, as that an isosceles triangle (has two right angles), not because it is isosceles, but because it is a triangle,) but the particular demonstrates because a thing is what it is, if then the demonstration per se is preferable, and the particular is such rather than the universal, particular demonstration would be the better.
Besides, if the universal is nothing else than 2. particulars, but demonstration produces opinion that this thing is something according to which it demonstrates, and that a certain nature of this kind is in things which subsist, (as of triangle besides particular (tri­ angles), and of figure besides particular (figures), and of num­ ber besides particular (numbers), but the demonstration about being is better than that about non-being, and that through which there is no deception than that through which there is, but universal demonstration is of this sort, (since men pro­ ceeding demonstrate as about the analogous, 1 as that a thing which is of such a kind as to be neither line nor number, nor solid nor superficies, but something besides these, is analo­ gous,) if then this is more universal, but is less conversant with being than particular, and produces false opinion, uni­ versal will be inferior to particular demonstration.
First then may we not remark that one of these arguments.
does not apply more to universal than to particular demonstration ?
For if the possession of angles equal to two right angles is inherent, not in respect of isosceles, but of triangle, whoever knows that it is isosceles knows less essentially2 than he who knows that it is triangle.
In short, if not so far as it is triangle, he then shows it, there will + Supply-in­ herent, or is de­ monstrated so far as it is tri­ angle.

not be demonstration, but if it is,7 whoever knows a thing so far as it is what it is, knows that thing more.
3
If then triangle is of wider extension (than isosceles), and there is the same definition,t and triangle is not equivocal, and the possession of two angles equal to two right angles is inhe­ rent in every triangle, triangle will have such angles, not so far as it is isosceles, but the isosceles will have them, so far as it is triangle.
Hence he who knows the uni- versal, knows more in regard to the being inherent than he who knows particularly, hence too the universal is better than the particular demonstration.
Moreover if there is one certain definition, and no equivocation, the universal will not subsist less, but rather more than certain par- 2.
ticulars, inasmuch as in the former there are things incorrupt­ ible, but particulars are more corruptible.
1 Besides, there is no necessity that we should apprehend this (universal) to be something besides these (particulars), because it shows one thing, no more than in others which do not signify substance, but quality, or relation, or action, but if a person thinks thus, it is the hearer, and not demonstration, which is to blamedAgain, if demonstration is a syllogism, showing the cause and the why, the universal indeed is rather causal, for that with which any thing is essentially present, is itself a cause to itself,* but the universal is the first,† therefore the universal is cause.
Wherefore the (universal) demonstra­ tion is better, since it rather partakes of the cause and the why, besides up to this we investigate the 3.
Universal alone is cogni­ zant of cause.
* Therefore more causal.

why, and we think that then we know it, when this is be­ coming, or is, not because something else (is), for thus there is the end and the last boundary.
For example, on what ac­ count did he come ?
that he might receive money, but this that he might pay his debts, this that he might not act unjustly, and thus proceeding, when it is no longer on account of some­ thing else, nor for the sake of another thing, then we say that he came, and that it is, and that it becomes on account of this as the end, and that then we especially know why he came.
If then the same occurs, as to all causes and inquiries into the why, but as to things which are so causes as that for the sake * (Aliquid sit out fiat.) Buhle. of which,.
we thus especially know, in other things also we then chiefly know, when this no longer subsists because another thing does.!
When therefore we know that the external angles are equal to four right angles, because it is isosceles, the inquiry yet remains, why because isosceles, because it is a triangle, and this be­ cause it is a rectilinear figure.
But if it is this no longer on account of something else, then we pre-eminently know, then 4.
It is true " non per aliud," but " per se." also universally, wherefore the universal is better.
Again, by how much more things are according to the particular, do they fall into infinites, but the universal tends to the simple and the finite, so far indeed as they are infinite, they are not subjects of science, but so far as they are finite they may be known, wherefore so far as they are universal, are they more objects 5.
Universal tend to the aim­ ple and finite, hence are more scientific.

of scientific knowledge, than so far as they are particular.
Universals however are more demon­ strable, and of things more demonstrable
Is there pre-eminent demonstration, for relatives are at one and the same time more,t whence the uni­ versal is better, since it is demonstration pre- eminently.
Besides, that demonstration is prefer­ able, according to which this and something else are known, to that, by which this alone is known, now he who has the uni­ versal knows also the particular, but the latter does not know the universal, wherefore even thus the universal will be more 6.
They come closer in de­ monstration to the principle.
eligible.
Again, as follows:
it is possible rather to demonstrate the universal, because a person demonstrates through a medium which is nearer to the principle, but what is immediate is the nearest and this is the principle;
if then that demonstration which is from the principle is more accurate than that which is not from the principle, the demonstration which is in a greater degree from the principle, is more accurate than that which is from it in a less degree.
Now the more universal is of this kind, wherefore the universal will be the better, as if it were required to demonstrate A of D, and the media should be B C, but B the higher, wherefore the demonstration through this is more universal.
Some of the above arguments are logical, it is chiefly clear however that the universal is more excellent, because when of two propositions we have that which is the prior,* we also in a certain degree know and possess in capacity that which is posterior;
thus if a man knows that every tri­ angle has angles equal to two right, he also in a certain respect knows in capacity that an isosceles 7.
The uni­ versal is above all superior, in that it compre­ hends the par­ ticular, and is more intel­ lectual.
*
The uni­ versal proposi­ tion.
triangle has angles equal to two right, even if he does not know that the isosceles is a triangle,t but he who has this proposition by no means knows the uni­ versal, neither in capacity nor in energy.
The universal proposition also is intuitively intelligible, but the particular ends in sensed.
1‡ t The particu­ lar proposition.
t An. Post. ii. ch. 19.THAT universal is better than particular demon­ stration, let so much be alleged, but that the af­ firmative is preferable to the negative, will be evident from this.
Let that demonstration be better, cæteris paribus,§ which consists of fewer postulates, or hypotheses, or propositions.
For if they2 are similarly known, quicker knowledge will be obtained through these, which is more eligible.
The reason however of this proposition, that that which consists of fewer is better, uni- 1.
That the de­ monstration which is through fewer postulates, etc., is, “ cæteris pa­ ribus," the bet­ ter-proved by example, and applied to af­ firmatives.
§ As it may be from unknown principles.
versally is this;
for if the media are similarly known, but things prior are more known, let the demonstration be through the media of B C D, that A is present with E, but through F G, that A is present with E.3
That A is present with D, and that A is present with E subsists similarly,|| but that A is with D, is prior and more known than that A is with E, for that If is demonstrated || Each is the conclusion.

and that is more credible through which (a thing is demonstrated).
Also the de­ monstration which is through fewer things is therefore better, † i. e. both af­ firmatives and negatives.

both t then are demonstrated through three terms, and two propositions, but the one assumes that something is,‡ and the other, that something is and is not,1 hence through a greater number of things (the demonstration is made so that it is the worse.

The nega­ tive requires the affirmative, but the latter does not need the former.

Moreover since it has been shown impossible for a syllogism to be produced with both propo­ sitions negative.
§but that one must of necessity be such (negative), and the other that a thing is present with, (that is affirmative,) we must in ad­ dition to this assume this,ll for it is necessary that affirmative (propositions) when the demonstration is increased,¶ should become more, but it is im­ possible that the negatives should be more than one in every syllogism.
For let A be present with nothing of those with which B is, but B be present with every C, if indeed, again, it should be necessary to increase both propo­ * To prove them by pro­ syllogisms.

2
Of A B then let the middle be D, but of B C let the mid­ dle be E, E then is evidently affirmative, † but D is affirmative indeed of B, yet is placed negatively as regards A, since it is necessary that D should be present with every B, but A with no D;

AD.‡
The same mode also subsists in other syllogisms, for the middle of affirmative terms is always affirmative in re­ spect of both (extremes), § but in the case of a negative (syllogism), the middle must be neces­ sarily negative in respect to one of the two,|| so there is one proposition of this kind,¶ but the others are affirmative.
If then that is more known and credible through which a thing is demon­ strated, but the negative is shown through the affirmative, and the latter not through the former, this, since it is prior, more known, and more credible, will be better.
Again, since the principle of syllogism is an universal imme­ diate proposition, but the universal proposition in an ostensive (demonstration) is affirmative, but in a negative is negative, and since the affirmative is prior to, and more known than, the negative, for negation is known through affirmation, and af formation is prior, just as being is prior to not be­ ing, therefore the principle of affirmative is better than that of negative demonstration, but that which uses better principles is better.
Moreover it partakes more of the nature of principle,.
since without affirmative there is no negative demonstration.
1 3. Affirmative comes nearer than negative to the nature of a principle.
* ἀρχοειδεσ­ τερα.SINCE affirmative is better than negative de­ monstration, it is evidently also better than that which leads to the impossible,† it is necessary however to know what the difference between them is.
Let A then be present with no B, but let B be with every C, wherefore it is necessary 1.
The differ­ ence proved by example, be­ tween direct demonstration and that which leads " ad ab­ surdum." t Vide infra. that A should be with no C, (the terms) then being thus as­ sumed, the negative proposition proving that A is not present with C will be ostensive.
The demonstration however to the impossible is as follows :
if it is required to show that A is not present with B it must be assumed present,t also that B is with C so that it will happen that A is with C.
Let this however be known and ac­ t

if then B is acknowledged present with C, it is im- possible that A should be with B.
The terms then indeed *

but it makes a difference which negative proposition is more known, viz.

Naturally, however, that A is not pre­ sent with B is prior to A is not present with C, for those things are prior to the conclusion, from which the conclusion (is collected), and that A is not with C is the conclusion, but that A is not with B is that from which the conclusion is de­ rived.
For neither if a certain thing happens to be subverted, is this the conclusion, but those (the premises) from which (the conclusion is derived).

If then that demonstration which is from things more known and prior be superior, but both are credi­ ble from something not existing, yet the one from the prior, the other from what is posterior, nega­ tive demonstration will in short be better, than that to the impossible, so that as affirmative de­ monstration is better than this,ll it is also evidently better than that leading to the impossible.
1.
That one sci­ ence is more subtle and ac­ curate than another.
ONE science is more accurate than, and prior to, another, both the science that a thing is, and the same why it is, but not separately that it is, than the science of why it is, also that which is not of a subject2 than that which is of a subject, for instance, arith- metic then harmonic science, and that which consists of fewer things than that which is from addition, as arithmetic than geometry.
I mean by " from addition," as unity is a sub­ stance without position, but a point is substance with posi­ tion,1 this is from addition.
ONE science is that which is of one genus of those things which are composed of first (principles), and are the parts or affections of these per se;
2 but a science is different from another, whose principles are neither from the same things, nor one from the other.

Thus, let A be to be changed, D to be moved, B to be delighted, and again G to be tranquillized.
It is true then to predicate D of B and A of D, for whoever is delighted is moved, and what is moved is changed:
again, it is true to predicate A of G, and G of B, for every one who is delighted is tranquillized, and he who is tran­ quillized is changed.
Wherefore there is a syllogism through different media,2 and not from the same class, yet not so that ‡ D and G. § B. || Through how many media.
neither is predicated of neither medium, since it is necessary that both:
should be present with something § which is the same.
We must also consider in how many ways || there may be a syl­ logism of the same thing through the other figures.
1.
This class does not come under the pro­ per subjects of demonstration.
THERE is no science through demonstration of that which is fortuitous, since the fortuitous is neither as necessary nor as for the most part, but that which is produced besides these, and demon­ stration is of one of these, For every syllogism is through premises, either necessary, or through those which are for the most part (true), and if indeed the propositions are necessary, the conclusion also is necessary;
but if for the most part (true), the conclusion also is of the same character.
Hence if the fortuitous is neither as for the most part nor necessary, there cannot be demonstration of it.
If Vide Ethics, b. vi. ch. 2 and 3.NEITHER is it possible to have scientific know­ ledge through sensation, for although there is sensible perception of such a thing as this, ana not of this particular thing,.
yet it is necessary to have a sensible perception of this particular thing, and some where and now.

ble sensibly to perceive the universal and in all things, for it is not this particular thing, nor now, otherwise it would not be universal, since we call the universal that which is always and every where.
Since then demonstrations are universal, but these cannot be perceived by sense, it is plain that neither can scientific be possessed through sense.
In fact, it is clear, that even if we could perceive by sense that a triangle has angles equal to two right, we should require demonstration, and not, as some say, know this scientifically, for it is necessary sensibly to perceive the singular, but science is from the knowledge of the universal.†
Where­ fore also if we were above the moon, and saw the t Cf. Meta. lib. i. ch. 1. earth opposite, we should not know the cause of an eclipse (of the moon).
For we should perceive that it is eclipsed, but in short should not perceive why, since there would not be a sensible perception of the universal.
Nevertheless, from observing this frequently to happen, by investigation of the universal, we should obtain demonstration, for the universal is manifest from many singulars, but is valuable, because it discloses the cause, wherefore the universal (knowledge) about such things, of which there is another cause, is more honour­ able than the senses and apprehension :
about first principles however there is another reason.

It is clearly then impossible to possess scien­ tific knowledge of any thing demonstrable by sensible perception, unless some one should affirm that sensible perception is this, to possess science through demonstration.
There are indeed certain problems which are referred to the deficiency of our sensible perception,1 for some if we should see them we should not investigate, not as knowing from seeing, but as possessing the universal from seeing.

t1. The impos­ sibility of prin­ ciples of all syllogisms be­ ing identical, proved.
THAT there should be the same principles of all syllogisms is impossible, first (this will be seen) by those who consider logically.
For some syl­ logisms are true, others false, since it is possible to conclude the true from the false, yet this but rarely happens, for instance, if A is truly predicated of C, but the middle B is false, for neither is A present with B nor B with ‡ Example (1.)
C ‡ If however the media of these propositions are assumed, they will be false, because every false conclusion is from false principles, but the true from true principles, and the false and the true are different.
Next, neither are the false (deduced) from the same (princi­ ples) with themselves, for they are false and contrary to each omnis ratiocinatio, alia ratio est:
hæc enim mente ipsâ intuemur et quasi amplectimur.
other, and cannot be simultaneous, for instance, it is impossible that justice should be injustice or timidity, that man should be a horse or an ox, or that the equal should be greater or less.
From these positions indeed (we may prove it) thus,* since neither are there the same principles of all the true (conclusions), for the principles of many are different in genus, and are not suitable, * i. e. that there are not the same prin­ ciplea of all things.
as units do not suit points, for the former have not position, but the latter have it.
At least it is necessary to adapt (either) to media or from above or below, or to have some terms within but others without.

Again, principles are not much fewer than conclusions, for the propositions are principles, but the propositions subsist when a term is either assumed or introduced.
Moreover, conclusions are infinite, but terms finite;
besides, some principles are from necessity, but others contingent.
To those therefore who thus consider, it will be impossible that there should be the same finite principles when the conclusions are infinite, but 2.

in­ tellect the prin­ ciple of science.
THE object of scientific knowledge and science (itself) differs from the object of opinion, and from opinion, because science is universal, and subsists through things necessary, and what is necessary cannot subsist otherwise than it does:
some things however are true, and subsist, yet may possibly subsist otherwise.
It is evident then that science is not conversant with these, (for else things which are capable of subsisting other­ ¶ See Ethics, b. vi. ch. 2 and 3, Brown's Notes, Bohn's edit.

How then is it possible t to opine and know the same thing, and why will opinion not be sci­ ence, if a person admits that every thing which he knows he may opine ?
for both he who knows and he who opines will follow through media till they come to things immediate, so that if the former knows, he also who opines knows.
For as it is possible to opine that a thing is, so likewise why it is, and this is the medium.
Or t if he so conceives things which cannot subsist otherwise, as if he had the definitions through which the demonstrations are framed, he will not opine, but So Waitz, αωλνεĩν.

know;
but if that they are true, yet that these are not pre­ sent with them essentially, and according to form, he will opine and not know truly both the that and the why, if in­ deed he should opine through things immediate;
but if not through the immediate, he will only opine that they are.
Still opinion and science are not altogether conversant with the same thing, but as both the true and the false opinion are in a manner about the same thing, thus also science and opinion are conversant with the same.
1
For as some say that true and false opinion are of the same;
absurd consequences * Cf. Met. b. iii. ch. 5. follow both in other respects, and also that he who opines falsely does not opined *
Now since the same thing is stated in several ways, in one way there may be, and in another there cannot be (a true and false opinion of the same).
For to opine truly that the diameter of a square is commensurate with its side, is ab­ surd, but because the diameter about which there are (con­ trary) opinions is the same thing, thus also they are of the same thing, but the essence of each according to the definition is not the same.
3
In like manner also knowledge and opinion are conversant with the same thing, for the former is so con­ versant with animal as that it is impossible animal should not exist, but the latter so as that it may possibly not exist, as if the one should be conversant with that which is man essen­ tially, but the other with man indeed, yet not with what is t But accident­ ally.

man essentially;
† tor it is the same thing, that is, man, but not the same as to the manner.
From these then it is clearly impossible to opine and know the same thing at the same time, for otherwise at one and the same time a man might have a notion that the same thing could and could not subsist otherwise, which is impossible.
In different (men) indeed each (of these) may be possible about the same thing, as we have said,.
but in the same (man) it is im­ possible even thus, since he would have a notion at the same time, for instance, that man is essen­ * Vide Aldrich in verb. “ opi­ nio."

For the rest, how it is necessary to distinguish between dis­ course and intellect, and science and art, and prudence and wisdom, belongs rather partly to the physical, and partly to the ethical theory.

SAGACITY is a certain happy extempore conjec­ ture of the middle term, as if a man perceiving that the moon always has that part lustrous which is towards the sun, should straightway understand why this occurs, viz.

Instances.
THE subjects of investigation are equal in num­ ber to the things which we scientifically know;
but we investigate four things;
that a thing is, why it is, if it is, what it is.
For when we in­ quire whether it is this, or that, having reference to a number (as whether the sun is eclipsed or not) we investigate the that, and a sign of this is that when we have found that it is eclipsed we desist from our in­ quiries, and if we knew from the first that it is eclipsed, we do not inquire whether it is so.
But when we know the that, we investigate the why, for instance, when we know that * i. e directing our attention to many things.

Taylor and Bulile add the opening sentence of the next chapter.
there is an eclipse, and there is an earthquake, we inquire why there is an eclipse, and an earth­ quake.
These things indeed we investigate thus,.
but some after another manner,† for instance, if there is, or is not, a centaur or a God.
I say if there is or is not, simply, 1 and not if it is white or not.
When however we know that a thing is, we inquire what it is, for instance, what God, or what man is.
‡1. The former four investiga­ tions may be reduced to two,THE things then which we investigate, and which having discovered we know, are such and so many, but when we inquire the that or if a thing is simply, then we inquire whether there is a medium of it or not, but when knowing, either that it is, or if it is, either in part or simply,1 we concerning the middle term, if there be one, and what it is.
again investigate why it is, or what it is, then we inquire what the middle is.
But I mean by the that if it is in a part and simply, in a part indeed (as) is the moon eclipsed or increased ?
for in such things we inquire if a thing is or is not;
but simply (as) if there is a moon or not, or if night is or not.*
In all these inquiries it occurs that we investigate either if there is a middle or what the middle is, for the cause is the middle, and this is investigated in all things.
Is there then an eclipse ?
is there a certain cause or not ?
after this, when we know that there is, we inquire what this is.

that, but simply substance, or not simply, but something of those which subsist per se, or accidentally, is the middle.
I mean by what is simply (substance) the subject, as the moon, or the earth, or the sun, or a triangle, but by a certain thing, (as) an eclipse, equality, inequality † it it is in the middle or not.‡
For in all these it is evident that what a thing is and why it is are the same;

That the inquiry is of the middle those things prove whose middle falls within the cognizance of the senses, since we inquire when we have not a sensible perception, as of an eclipse, whether it is or not.
But if we were above the moon we should not inquire neither if, nor why, but it would be immediately evident, as from sensible perception we should also obtain knowledge of the universal;
3. We do not investigate the middle, if the thing itself, and its cause, fall within the cognizance of our senses.
(Vide Waits, note, p. 381.) for sense (would show us) that the earth is now opposed, Cf. Metap.

principles, † also what a definition is, and of what subjects doubting first about these.
But let the commencement of the future (doubts) be that which is most appropriate to the following discussion, since 1.
We cannot know by defi­ nition every subject capable of demonstra­ tion.
perhaps a man might doubt whether it is possible to know the same thing, and according to the same by definition and demonstration, or whether it is impossible ?
For definition seems to be of what a thing is, but every thing which signifies) what a thing is, is universal and affirmative, but some syllo­ gisms are negative, others not universal;
for instance, all those in the second figure are negative, but those in the third not universal.
Next, neither is there definition of all affirmatives in the first figure, as that every triangle has angles equal to two right angles;
the reason of this is, because to know scientifically that which is demonstrable, is to possess de­ monstration, so that if there is demonstration in regard to things of this kind, there can evidently not be also definition of them, for a person might know by definition without de­ monstration, since nothing prevents the possession of it at one and the same time.
A sufficient evidence of this is also derived from induction, for we have never known by de­ finition, any of those which are inherent per se nor which are accidents ;
besides, if definition be a certain indication of sub­ stance, it is evident that such things are not substances.
Clearly then, there is not definition of every thing of which there is also demonstration, but what, is there then demonstration of every thing of which there is definition or not ?
there is one reason and the same also of this..
For of one thing, so far as it is one, there is one science, so 2.
Nor by de­ monstration all those which are capable of de­ finition.
* Proposed above.
that if to know that which is demonstrable be to possess demonstration, an impossibility would happen, for he who possesses definition would know scientifically without de­ monstration.
Besides, the principles of demonstration are definitions, of which it has been shown before, there will not be demonstrations, † since either principles will be demonstrable, and principles of principles, and this would proceed to infinity, or the first (principles) will be indemonstrable definitions.
t See Part i. ch. 3 and 22.
Yet if there are not of every thing and the same, may there not be definition and demonstra­ tion of a certain thing and the same ?
or is it im­ possible ?
since there is not demonstration of what 3.
In fact, no­ thing capable of definition admits de­ monstration.
there is definition, ror definition is of what a thing is, and of substance, but all demonstrations appear to suppose and assume what a thing is, as mathematics, what is unity and what an odd number, and the rest in like manner.
More­ over every demonstration shows something of somewhat, as that it is, or that it is not, but in definition one thing is not predicated of another, as neither animal of biped, nor this of animal, nor figure of superficies, for su­ perficies is not figure, nor figure superficies.
Again, it is one thing to show what a thing is, but an­ other to show that it is, definition then shows what a thing is, but demonstration that this thing, either 4.
One part of a definition is not predicated of another.
Vide Hill's Logic, and Whately on " Definition.” is or is not of this.
Of a different thing indeed there is a dif­ ferent demonstration, unless it should be as a certain part of the whole.
I say this because the isosceles has been shown (to have angles equal) to two right, if every triangle has been shown (to * The isosceles being a species of triangle, is to it as a part to a whole.

have them), tor that is a part, but this a whole:
* these however, that a thing is, and what it is, do not thus subsist in reference to each other, since the one is not a part of the other.
Evidently then there is neither entirely demon­ stration of what there is definition, nor entirely de­ finition of what there is demonstration;
hence in short it is impossible to have both t of the same thing, so that it is also evident that definition and demonstration will neither be the same, nor the one contained in the other, otherwise their sub­ jects1 would subsist similarly.
t1. In order to collect by a syl­ logism what a thing is, the middle term ought to ex­ press the defi­ nition.
LET then so far these things be matters of doubt, but as to what a thing is whether is there, or is there not, a syllogism and a demonstration of it, as the present discussion supposed ?
for a syllogism shows something in respect of somewhat through a medium, but the (definition) what a thing is, is both peculiar and is predicated in respect of what it is.

§ A B C.
Now it is necessary that these should reciprocate :
∥ for if A is the property of C, it is evidently alsc that of B, and that of C, so that all § reciprocate with each other.
Nevertheless, if A is present with every B in respect of what it is, and uni­ versally B is predicated of every C in respect of what it is, it is also necessary that A should be predicated of C in the ques­ tion what it is.
Still if some one should assume without this reduplication,2 it will not be necessary that A should be predi­ cated of C in the question what a thing is, though A should ¶
In the major. * In the minor.
t A and B. be predicated of B ¶ in the same question, but not of those of which B is predicated in this question..
Now both these † will signify what a thing (C) is, wherefore B will also be the definition of C, hence if both signify what a thing is, and what the very nature of it is, there will be the very nature of a thing prior in the middle term.
Universally also, if it is possible to show what man is, let C be man, but A what he is, whether biped animal, or any thing else ;
in order then that a conclusion should be drawn, A must necessarily be predicated of every B, and of this there will be another middle definition, so that this also will be a definition of a man, wherefore a person assumes what he ought to show, for B also is the definition of a man.
We must however consider it in two proposi­ tions, and in first and immediate (principles), for 2.
A twofold consideration.
what is stated becomes thus especially evident:
they there­ fore who show what the soul is, or what man or any thing else is, by conversion, beg the question,' as if a man should assume the soul to be that which is the cause to itself of life,.
and that this is number moving itself he must necessarily so assume as a postulate that the soul is number moving itself, as that it is the same thing.
For it does not follow if A is con­ * The minor.

For the very nature of animal is predicated of the very nature of man, since it is true that whatever exists as man, exists as animal, just as every man is animal,) yet not so, as for both to be one thing.‡

Therefore there has been no demonstration, for he has made a "peti­ tie principii.1.

NEVERTHELESS, neither does the method through divisions infer a conclusion, as we observed in the analysis about figures,- since it is never necessary that when these things exist, † that t should exist, as neither does he demonstrate who forms an in­ duction.
For the conclusion ought not to inquire nor to exist from being granted, but it necessarily is, when they § exist, although the respondent does not acknowledge it.

It signifies nothing however, whether he does this in respect of many 2.

things or few, since it is the same thing;
to those therefore who thus proceed, and in what is capa­ ble of syllogistic conclusion, this use is unsyllo­ gistic.
For what prevents the whole of this || being true of man, yet without enunciating what a thing is, or the very nature of it ?
Again, what prevents something being added to, or taken away from, or exceeding the essence ?
2Negligence then happens about these things, but we may avoid it by assuming all things (as granted) in respect of what a thing is, and the first being made a postulate by arranging the order in division, omitting nothing.
This however is requisite, for it is necessary that there should be an individual, yet nevertheless there is not a syllogism, but if so it indicates after another manner.
And this is not at all absurd, since neither perhaps does he who makes an induction demonstrate, though at the same time he renders something manifest, but he 4.
By constant division, when a perfect defi­ nition is ar­ rived at, we are said to ar­ rive at the in­ dividual.
who selects definition from division does not state a syllo­ gism.
1
For as in conclusions without media, if a man state that from such things being granted, this particular thing necessarily exists, it is possible to inquire why, thus also is it in definitions by division.
What is man ?
A mortal animal, pedestrian, biped, without wings.
Why?
according to each addition,2 for he will state and show by division as he thinks that every one is either mortal or immortal.
The whole however of such a sentence is not definition,­ wherefore though it should be demonstrated by division, yet the definition does not become a syllogism.3 * For the defi­ nition has to be selected from it, i. e. a mortal animal.
Is it however possible to demonstrate what a thing is according to substance, but from hypo­ thesis assuming that the very nature of a thing in the question what it is, is something of its 1.
It is proved that there is no demonstration of the defini­ tion, neither if one proposition defines the de­ finition itself.

for this is its essence.
Or again, has a person assumed the very nature of a thing in this also ?
for we must neces­ sarily demonstrate through a middle term.
3
Moreover, as in a syllogism, we do not assume what is to have been syllo­ gistically concluded, (for the proposition is either a whole or a part, from which the syllogism consists,) thus neither ought the very nature of a thing to be in a syllogism, but this should be separate from the things which are laid down, and in reply to him who questions whether this has been syllo­ gistically concluded or not, we must answer that it is, for this was the syllogism.
4
And to him who asserts that the very nature of the thing was not concluded, we must reply that it was, for the very nature of the thing was laid down by us, so that it is necessary that without the definition of syllogism, or of the definition itself, something should be syllogistically inferred.
2.
Nor by any other hypothe­ tical syllogism.
Also, if a person should demonstrate from hy­ pothesis, for instance, if to be divisible is the essence of evil;
but of a contrary, the essence is contrary of as many things as possess a contrary;
but good is contrary to evil, and the indivisible to the divisible, then the essence of good is to be indivisible.

and which recipro­ cates.t
To both however there is the same doubt against him who demonstrates by division, and against the syllogism thus formed, why man will be an animal biped pedestrian, 1 but not an ani­ mal and pedestrian,‡ for from the things assumed, there is no necessity that there should be one predicate, but just as the same man may be both a musician and a grammarian.

Moreover, if he should show what a thing is, and that it is, how will he show this in the same sentence ?
for both definition and also demonstration manifest one certain thing, but what man is is one thing, and the es­ sence of man is another.
We next say that it is necessary to show by demonstration every thing, that it is, except it be substance, but to be, is not substance to any thing, for being is not the genus.

For neither do definitions demonstrate that it is possi­ ble for that to be which is asserted, nor that that thing is, of which they say there are definitions, 1 but it is always possible to say why.
¶If then he who defines shows either what a thing is or what the name signifies, except there is, by no means (an explanation) of what a thing is, definition will be a sentence signifying the same thing as a name, but this is absurd.
2
For in the first place there would be a definition of non-essences and of nonentities, since it is possible even for non-entities to have a signification.
Again, all sentences will be definitions, for we might give a name to any sentence, so that we might all discuss in definitions, and the Iliad would be a definition.
Besides, no science would demonstrate that this name signifies this thing, neither there­ fore do definitions manifest this.
From these things therefore it appears that neither definition nor syllogism are the same thing, nor are syllogism and definition of the same thing, moreover that definition neither demon­ strates nor shows any thing, and that we can know what a thing is neither by definition nor by demonstration.
6. Recapitula­ tion.
It is proved that we can know " quid res sit neither by de­ finition nor by demonstration.

Now since it is the same thing as we have said to know what a thing is, and to know the cause where­ fore * it is, and the reason of this is, that there is a certain cause,t and this is either the same or another, t and if it is another, it is either demon­ strable or indemonstrable;
if then it is another, and is capable of demonstration,1 it is necessary that the cause should be a medium, and should be de­ monstrated in the first figure, for that which is demonstrated is both universal and affirmative.

are predicated in respect of what a thing is, it is necessary that the medium should be what it is, and a property in respect of properties, wherefore of two essential natures of the same thing,* it will demonstrate the one,f but not the other.
‡That this method then is not demonstration, has been shown before, but it is a logical syllogism of what a thing is, still let us show in what method this is possible, discussing it again from the be­ ginning.
For as we investigate why a thing is, when we know that it is, but sometimes those become evident at the same time, but it is not possible to know why it is, prior to knowing that it is, it is clear that in like manner the very nature of a thing, or what it is, cannot be known, with­ out knowing that it is, since it is impossible to know what a thing is, when ignorant if it is.
§ We sometimes indeed know if it is, accidentally, knowing sometimes something belonging to the thing, 1 as thunder we know, because it is a cer­ tain sound of the clouds, and an eclipse, because it is a cer- tain privation of light, and a man, because it is a certain animal, and soul, because it moves itself.
As regards then whatever we know accidentally that they are, it is by no means necessary that we should possess any thing by which to know what they are, for neither do we (really) know that they are, and to inquire what a thing is, when we do not know that it is, is to inquire about nothing.
In those things however of which we know something, it is easy (to inquire) what they are;
hence as we know that a thing is, so also are we disposed to know what it is, now of those things, of whose essential nature we know something, let this be first an example, an eclipse A, the moon C, the opposition of the earth B.* To inquire then whether there is an eclipse * Example (I.) or not, is to inquire whether B is or not, but this does not at all differ from the inquiry if there is a reason of it, and if this is, we say that that also is.
Or we (inquire) of which con­ tradiction there is a reason, whether of possessing, or of not possessing, two right angles, but when we have discovered, we know at the same time, that it is, and why it is, if it is inferred through media ;
† but it it is not so in­ ferred, we know the that, but not the why.

Yet as it is clear that A is with C, (to inquire why it is, is to in­ ‡ Example (2.) vestigate what B is, whether it is the opposition (of the earth), or the turn of the moon, or the extinction of light, but this is the definition of the other extreme, as in those (examples) of A, since an eclipse is the interposition of the earth.

3. Of what a thing is, there is neither a syl­ logism nor de­ monstration, but it is mani­ fested by both.
Cf. ch. 3. We have shown therefore thus, how what a thing is, is assumed, and becomes known, where­ fore there is neither syllogism nor demonstration of what a thing is, still it will become evident through syllogism, and through demonstration;
and hence without demonstration it is neither possible to know what a thing is, of which there is another cause, nor is there demonstration of it, as we have already observed in the doubts.

OF some things indeed there is a certain other cause, but of others there is not, so that it is plain that some of them are immediate, and principles, whose existence and what they are, we must sup­ pose, or make manifest after another manner,2 which indeed the arithmetician does, for he both supposes what unity is, and that it is.
Of those however which have a medium, and of whose essence there is another cause, it is possible, as we have said, to produce a manifestation through demonstration, yet not by demonstrating what they are.
SINCE definition is said to be a sentence (ex­ planatory) of what a thing is, it is evident that one definition will be of what a name signifies, or another nominal sentence, as what a thing signi-
1. Definition either explains the name of a thing;
fies, which is so far as it is a triangle, which when we know that it is, we inquire why it is.
1
Still it is difficult thus to assume things, the existence of which we do not know, and the cause of this difficulty has been explained before, because neither do we know whether it is or is not, except accidentally.
One sentence is indeed in two ways, the one by conjunction, as the Iliad, but the other from signifying one thing of one, not accidentally.
The above-named then is one definition of a definition, but the other definition is a sentence showing why a thing is, so that the former 2.

signifies, but does not demonstrate, but the lattel will evi­ dently be, as it were, a demonstration of what a thing is, dif­ fering from demonstration in the position (of the terms).
For there is a difference between saying, why does it thunder ?
and what is thunder ?
for thus a person will answer, because fire is extinguished in the clouds;
but what is thunder ?
the sound of fire extinguished in the clouds;
hence there is the same sentence spoken in another manner, and in the one way there is a continued demonstration, but in the other there is a de- finition.
Moreover the definition of thunder is, a sound in * Cf. ch. 8. (Vide also Mansel's Logic, page 16, App. note.) the clouds, but this is the conclusion of the de­ monstration of what it is;
now the definition of things immediate is, the indemonstrable thesis of essence.*1 3. Brief sum­ mary-three forms of defini­ tion.
t i. e. in grammatical form, or in the position of the terms.
One definition then is, an indemonstrable sen­ tence (significative) of essence, but another is a syllogism of essence, differing from demonstration in case,† and a third is the conclusion of the de­ monstration of what a thing is.
Wherefore, from what we have said, it is evident how there is, and how there is not, a demonstration of what a thing is, also of what things there is, and of what there is not;
more­ over in how many ways definition is enunciated, and how it demonstrates the essence of a thing, and how it does not;
also of what things there is, and of what there is not, definition ;
yet more, how it subsists with respect to demonstration, and how it may, and how it may not be, of the same thing.
1.
Causes of things are four, which are all expressed bySINCE we think that we scientifically know, when we are cognizant of the cause, but causes are four,2 one indeed as to the essence of a thing,* another that which from certain things ex­ isting, this necessarily exists,f a third that which first moves something,‡ and a fourth on account of which a thing (exists) ;
§ all these are demonstrated through a medium.||
For the one that this existing it is necessary that that should be, is not from one proposition being assumed, but from two at the least, but this is, when they have one medium;
this one therefore being assumed,¶ there is neces­ sarily a conclusion, which is evidently thus:
Why is the angle a right one in a semicircle, or from the existence of what, is it right ? *
Let then A be a right angle, B the half of two right angles, and the middle term.

§ The final. ||

(Vide note.) ¶
The middle.
* Vide Euclid, b. iii. prop. 31. the angle in the semicircle C. Hence B is the cause why A the right angle is inherent in C, i. e. in the angle of a semi­ circle ;
for this angle is equal to A, but C is equal to B, for it is the half of two right angles ;
B then being the half of two right angles, A is inherent in C, and this was for the angle in a semicircle to be a right angle.†
This t however is the same as the explanation of the essence of a thing, § because definition signifies this, but the cause of the essence of a thing has been shown to be the middle. ||
Why was there a Median war with the Athenians ?

cause of waging war with the Athenians ?
Because the latter with the Eretrians attacked Sardis;
this was the first cause of the movement.
Let war then be A, first made the attack B, the Athenians C, B then is present with C, i. e. to have first made the attack is present with the Athenians, but A is also with B, for they make war with the aggressors, A then is present with B, i. e. to wage war is present with the aggressors, but this, B, is present with the Athenians, for they were the aggressors.
Wherefore the middle is the cause here, and that which first moves;
but of those things, whose cause is for the sake of some­ thing, as, why does he walk ?
that he may be well • why is a house b lilt ?
that furniture may be preserved ;
the one is for the sake of health, but the other for the sake of preservation.
Still there is no difference between why is it necessary to walk after supper, and for the sake of what is it necessary ?
but let walking after supper be C, the food not to rise B, to be well A.
Let then walking after supper be the cause why the food does not rise to the mouth of the stomach, and let this be healthy ;
for B, that is, for the food not to rise, appears to be present with walking, C, and with this A, salubrious.
What then is the cause that A, which is that for the sake of * B. t A. t Example (2.) § The premises and conclusion.

which (the final cause), is present with C ? B (is the cause), that is, the food not rising, this * how­ ever is as it were, the definition of it,t for A will be thus explained.1‡
Why is B present with C ?
because to be thus affected is to be well:
we must nevertheless change the sentences, § and thus the several points will be more clear.||
The genera­ tions here¶ indeed, and in causes respecting mo­ tion,* subsist vice versa, for there t it is necessary that the middle t should be first generated, but here § C, which is the last,|| and that for the sake of which is generated the last.¶
2. The same thing may sometimes pos­ sess twocauses.
Possibly indeed the same thing may be for the sake of something, and from necessity;
for instance, why does light pass through a lantern ?
for ne­ cessarily that which consists of smaller particles passes through larger pores, if light is produced by transit, also (it does so) on account of something, that we may not fall.
If then it possibly may be, is it also possible to be generated ?
as if it thunders, fire being extinguished, it is necessary that it should crash and rumble, and, as the Pythagoreans say, for the sake of threatening, that those in Tartarus may be terri­ tied.
Now there are many things of this kind, especially in those which are constituted and con­ sist from nature, for nature produces one thing for the sake of something,* and another from necessity;
t but necessity is two-fold, one accord­ ing to nature and impulse,‡ another with violence, contrary to impulse;
thus a stone is borne from necessity both upward and downward, yet not from the same necessity.
§ In things however which are from reason, || some never subsist from chance, as a house, or a statue, nor from neces­ sity,1 but for the sake of something, whilst others are also from fortune, as health and safety.2¶
Especially in those which are capable of a various

(Cf. Phys. lib. iv.)THE cause of things which are, is the same also as that of things which are generated, which 1.

have been generated, and which will be, for the middle is the cause, except that being is the cause to be, what is generated, to those which are generated, what has been, to those which have been, and what will be to those that will be.
Thus why was there an eclipse ?
because the earth was interposed, but an eclipse is generated, because an interposition of the earth is generated, but there will be, because the earth will be, and there is, because it is interposed.
What is ice ?
Let it be as­ sumed to be congealed water;
let water be C, congealed A, the middle cause B, a perfect defect of heat;
B then is pre­ * Example (1.) sent with C, but with this A, viz. to be congealed,* but ice is generated, when B is generated, it was so, when the latter was so, and it will be, when the latter will be.
2.
Causes and effects properly simultaneous -an inquiry into causes of things not si­ multaneous.
Hence that which is thus a cause, and that of which it is the cause, are generated at one and the same time, when they are generated;
are si­ multaneously when they are;
and in like man­ ner, in respect to the having been, and the will be, generated.
In the case of things which are not simul­ taneous, are there in a continued time, as it seems to us, dif­ ferent causes of different things ?
for instance, is another thing having been generated the cause of this thing having been generated, and another thing which will be, the cause that this will be, and of this being, something which was generated t

t
That because the foundation was laid the house was built.
§ That is, the Interval be­ tween the before ?
the syllogism however is from what was afterwards generated.
†
And the principle of these are those things which have been generated, wherefore the case is the same as to things which are generated.
From the prior indeed there is no (syllogism), as that this thing was afterwards generated, because that thing was generated,‡ it is the same also in regard to the future.
For whether the time be indefinite or definite, § it will not result that because that thing was truly said to have been generated, this which is posterior is truly said to have been generated, since in the interval it will be false to say this,1 when already another thing- has been produced.
The same reasoning also happens to what will be, nor because thatf was produced, will this t be, as the middle must be generated at the same time;
2 of things that have been that which has been, of the future the future, of what are produced that which is produced, of things which are that which is, but of what was generated, and of that which will be, the middle cannot possibly be former and the latter genera­ tion.

produced at one and the same time.
Moreover neither can the interval § be indefinite, nor definite,3 since it will be false to assert it in the interval ;
4 but we must consider what is connected with it, so that after the § Between the past and fu­ ture.
having been generated, to be generated may exist in things.
5
Or is it evident that what is generated is not connected with what was generated ?
for the past does not cohere with what was generated, since they are terms and individuals.
As then neither points are mutually connected, those things which have been produced are not so, for both are indivisible;
nor for the same reason does that which is, cohere with that which has been generated, for that which is generated is divisible, but that which has been is indivisible.
As a line then is to a point, so is that which is to that which was generated, for infinite things which have been, are inherent in that which is;
|| we must however enunciate these matters more clearly in the universal discussions about motion.
¶Concerning then the manner in which, when there is a successive generation, the middle cause subsists, let so much be assumed, for in these also it is necessary that the middle and the first should be immediate, thus A was generated because C ||
As infinite points in a line.
IT Vide Physics, b. vi. 5.
In the cases of past and fu­ lures, some principle or first must be taken.
was so, but C was after, A before.
The principle indeed is C, because it is nearer to the now, which is the principle of time, but C was generated if D was, hence from D having been, it is necessary that A should have been.
The cause how­ ever is C, for from D having been, it is necessary that C should have been generated, but C having been, A must of necessity have been produced before.
When however we thus assume the middle, will (the process) at any time stop at the immediate, or on account of the infinity will a medium always intervene ?
for, as we have stated, what has been ge­ nerated is not connected with what has been ;
nevertheless we * So Waltz.
Mediate, Tay­ lor, Buhle, and Bekker.
must commence at least from the immediate * and from the first now.
1 Likewise with regard to the “ will be," for if it is true to say that D will be, it is necessary that, prior to this, it should be true to say that A will be, the cause however of this is C, for if D will be, prior to it C will be, but if C will be, prior to it A will be.
Likewise also in these the division is infinite, for things which will be, are not mutually coherent, but an im­ mediate principle must also be assumed in these.
It is thus in the case of works, if a house has been built, stones must necessarily have been cut, and formed;
and why this ?
because the foundation must of necessity have been laid, if the house was built, but if the foundation was laid, stones must neces­ sarily have been prepared before.
Again, if there shall be a house, in like manner there will be stones prior to this, still the demonstration is in like manner through a medium, for the foundation will have a prior subsistence.
6.
Things ge­ nerated in a cir­ cle must have a similar de­ monstration.

also Post. An. b. i. ch. 3. § Changed into prem.
Notwithstanding, since we see in things which are, that there is a certain generation in a circle,† this happens when the middle and the extremes fol­ low each other, for in these there is a reciprocation ;
this however was shown in the first treatise,‡ viz. that the conclusions are converted;
§ but the case of being in a circle is thus.
In works it appears after this manner, when the earth has been moist­ ened, vapour is necessarily produced, from the production of this, there is a cloud, from this last, water, and from the presence of this, the earth is necessarily moistened, this however was the (cause) at first, so that it has come round in a circle, for any one of these existing, another is, :
.nd if that is, another, and from this, the first.
There are some things which are generated universally, (for always, and in every thing, they either thus subsist, or are generated,) but others not always, but for the most part;
thus not every vigorous man has a beard, but this is generally the case, now of such things it is necessary that the medium also should be for the most part;
for 7.
Of things which are not universally, but usually, the principles should be non- necessary, but for the most part true.
Cf. Wallis, iii. 23.
if A is universally predicated of B, and this of C universally, it is necessary that A also should be predicated always, and of every C, (for the universal is that which is present with every individual and always,) but it was supposed to be for the most part, wherefore it is necessary that the medium also, B, should be for the most part:
hence of those which are for the most part, the principles are immediate, as many as thus subsist for the most part, or are generated.
WE have before shown how what a thing is, is attributed to definitions, and in what way there is or is not a demonstra­ tion or definition of it, how therefore it is necessary to inves­ tigate 1 things which are predicated in respect to what a thing is, let us now discuss.
Of those then, which are always present with each individual, some have a wider extension, yet are not beyond the genus.-
I mean those have a wider extension, as many as are present with 1.

* Of the sub­ ject.
each individual universally, yet also with another thing, thus there is something which is present with every triad, and also with that which is not a triad, as being is present with a triad, but also to that which is not number.
Nevertheless the odd is present with every triad, and is of wider extension, for it is with five, but it is not beyond the genus, t for the five is number, and nothing out of num­ ber is odd.
Now such things we must take so far t i. e. number.

t
Than the thing to be defined.
until so many are first assumed, each of which * is of wider extension,!
but all of them together are not of greater extent, for it is necessary that this should be the substance of a thing.'
For ex­ ample, number, the odd is present with every triad, the first in both ways, both as not being mea­ sured by number and as not being composed of numbers.
2
Now therefore the triad is this, viz.
the first odd number, and the first in this way, for each of these is present, the one with all odd numbers, but the last also with the dual, yet all of them (together) with ‡ Last book, ch. 4. none (but the triad).
Since however we have shown above,‡ that those things which are predi­ cated in respect of what a thing is are necessary, but universals are necessary, but what are thus assumed of a triangle, or any other thing, are assumed in respect to what a thing is, thus from necessity the triad will be these things.
That his however is its essence appears from this, since it is neces­ sary, unless the very nature of a triad were not this, that this should be a certain genus, either denominated or anonymous.
It will be therefore of wider extension than to be with a triad alone, for let the genus be supposed of that kind as to be more widely extended according to power, if then it is present with nothing else than individual triads, this will be the essence of the triad.
Let this also be supposed, that an ultimate predi­ cation like this of individuals is the essence of each thing, wherefore in like manner, when any thing is thus demon­ strated, it will be the essence of that thing.
3.
Method of dividing the genus.
§ Which can.
Nevertheless it is right when any one is con­ versant with a certain whole,3 to divide the genus into the individuals which are first in species, § for instance, number into triad and dual, then to endeavour thus to assume the definitions of these, not be divided into species.
as of a straight line, of a circlet and of a right angle ;
after­ wards assuming what the genus is, for instance, whether it is quantity or quality, he should investigate the peculiar pas­ sions* through common first (principles.)3
For those which happen to the composites from indi­ viduals will be evident from the definitions,† be­ cause definition and that which is simple4 are * Of the first species.
t
Of the first species.
the principles of all things, and accidents are essentially pre­ sent with simple things alone, but with others according to them.
The divisions indeed by differences5 are useful for our progression in this way, but how indeed they demonstrate we have shown before,t but they would thus be useful only for syllo­ gizing what a thing is, and indeed they may ap­ pear to do nothing, but to assume every thing immediately,§ just as if any one assumed from the beginning without division.
It makes some 4. Differential division useful in the investi­ gation of defi.

difference, however, whether what is predicated be so, prior or posterior, as for instance, whether we call animal, mild biped, or biped, animal mild, for if every thing consists of two,|| and one certain thing is animal mild, and again from this, and the difference, man or || Genus and difference.
any thing else which is one, consists, we must necessarily make a postulate by division.
Besides, thus only is it possible to leave out nothing in the definition, since when the first genus is assumed, if a person takes a certain inferior division,7 every thing will not fall into this;
for instance, not every animal has entire or divided wings, but every animal which is winged, for this is the difference of it,¶ but the first difference of animal is that into which every ¶ i. e. the divi­ sion of it.

Likewise in regard to each of the rest, both of *

those genera.
which are external to animal, and of those which are contained under it, as of bird,t is that into which every bird falls, and of fish that into which every fish falls.
Thus proceeding we may know that nothing is omitted, t but other­ wise we must omit something, and not know it.
It is not at all necessary that he who defines and divides, should know all things that subsist;
though some say it is impossible to know the dif­ ferences of each thing without knowing each ;
but it is impossible to know each thing without differences, for that from which this does not dif­ fer, is the same with this, but that from which it differs is something else than this.
In the first place then this is false, for it is not something else according to every difference, since there are many differences in things which are the same in species, yet not according to substance, nor per see Next, when any one 6.
A division into opposite members, as of animal into rational and irrational.
§ Rational, etc. || From genus to species by differences.
assumes opposites, and difference, and that every thing falls into this or that, and assumes also that the question is in one part of the two, and knows this, it is of no consequence whether he knows or does not those other things of which the dif­ ferences § are predicated.
For it is evident that thus proceeding,|| if he should arrive at those of which there is no longer a difference, he will ob­ tain the definition of the substance;
but that every thing will fall into division, if there should be opposites of which there ¶

Vide Whately, Hill, and Aldrich.
is no medium, is not a postulate, since every thing must necessarily be in one of them, if in­ deed it will be the difference of it.
In order to frame definition by divisions, we must attend to three things, viz. to assume the things predicated in respect of what a thing is;
to arrange these, which shall be first or se­ cond ;
and that these are all.
Now the first of these arises from our being able as syllogistically to collect accident, that it is inherent,* so to con­ struct through genus.t
There will however be a proper arrangement if what is first be assumed, * Vide Topics, book if.
t Topics, book iv.
and this will be if that be taken which is consequent to all, but all not consequent to it;
for there must be something of this kind.
This then being taken, there must now be the same method in the things inferior, since the second will be that which is first of the rest, and the third that which is first of the following, for what is superior being taken away, what­ ever succeeds will be the first of the others;
there is also similar reasoning in the other cases.
Still that all these should be, is clear from assuming what is first in the division, that every animal is either this or that,t but this is inherent;
§ and again the difference of this whole 1 but that of the last 2 there is no longer any differ­ ence, or immediately with the last difference 3 this || does not differ in species from the whole:
4 for it t e. g. rational or irrational.
§ e. g. rational. || Being as­ sumed.
is clear that neither more (than is necessary is added, for every thing has been assumed in reference to what a thing is, nor is any thing deficient, for it would be either genus or difference.
Both the first then is genus, and this assumed together with differ­ ences, but all the differences are contained, for there is no longer any posterior difference.¶
Otherwise the last.
would differ in species, this however has been shown not to differ.
tStill we must investigate, looking to those which are similar and do not differ, first (considering) what that is which is the same in all these, then again in other things which are in the same genus with them, and which are among themselves the same 8.

Yet when in these that is assumed which all have the same, and in others similarly, we must consider in the things assumed whether it is the same, until we arrive at one reason, for this will be the definition of the thing.
Yet if we do not arrive at one, but at two 01 more, it is evident that the question will not be one, but * μεγαλοψυχία. Cf. Eth. Nic. iv. 3 and 4, and Shaks.

Again, in other instances, as in that of Lysander or Socrates.
If then (it is common to these) to behave in the same manner, in prosperity and adversity, taking these two, I consider what indifference with regard to fortune, and what impatience under insult possess in common ;
if they have nothing there will be two species of magnanimity.
10.
The espe­ cially universal most difficult to be defined.
Every definition is nevertheless universal, for the physician does not prescribe what is whole­ some for a certain eye, but defines what is fit for every eye, or for the species.
The singular however is easier to define than the universal, wherefore we must pass from singulars to universals, for equivocations lie more con­ cealed in universals, than in things without a difference.
But as in demonstrations the power of syllogizing must necessarily § Vide logical rules for defini­ tion in Aldrich.
be inherent, so also perspicuity must be in de­ finitions,§ and there will be this, if through things which are singularly enunciated, what is in each genus be separately denned;
as with the similar, not every similar, but that which is in colours and in figures, and the sharp that which is in voice, and so to proceed to what is common, taking care that equivocation does not occur.
But if it is not right to use metaphors in disputation, we must clearly not define by meta­ phors,* nor by those things which are spoken by metaphor, otherwise it will be necessary to use metaphors in disputation.
t * Because of ambiguity.
t Because deft­ nition is some­ times employ­ ed in discus­ sion.
(Cf. Waitz, vol. ii. p. 420.)Now that we may have problems, we must select sections and divisions, and thus select, the com­ mon genus of all being supposed, as for example, if animals were the subjects of consideration, (we must first consider, what kind of things are pre­ t Cf. An. Prior i. 4, and i. 26;

sent with every animal.
When these have been taken, we must again see what kind of things are consequent to every first individual of the rest,2 thus if this is a bird, what things follow every bird, and so always that which is nearest,3 for we shall evidently now be able to say why things are present, which are consequent to those under what is common, as why they are present with man or horsed Let then animal be A, B things consequent to every animal, C D E certain animals, why then B is present with D is evident, for it is present through A:
in a similar manner with the rest, and in others there is always the same reasoning.
§ § Example (1.)* Synonyms.
2. Also of in­ vestigating that which is inherent in the singulars as something common.
Now then we speak according to presented common names,1 * but we must not only consider in these, but also assume if any thing else should be seen to be common, afterwards consider to what things this is consequent, and the quality of the things consequent to this,2 as those consequent to having horns are the possession of a rough muscular lining to the stomach, and the not having teeth in both jaws.
t Viz. to have teeth in one jaw only, etc. ‡
With the spe­ cies of homed animals.
Moreover to what things the possession of horns is consequent, for it will be evident why what has been mentioned t is present with them,t for it will be so in consequence of their possessing horns.
3. Selection κατὰ TO ἀνά- Αογον. § i. e. to as­ sume a com­ mon analogous thing.
There is yet another mode of selection by anal­ ogy,§ since it is impossible to assume one and the same thing, which it is necessary to call sepium, spine, and bone, there are also things consequent to these, as if there were one certain nature of this kind.
31. Problems are identical which have either the same middleSOME problems are the same from having the same medium, for instance, because all things are an antiperistasis,4 but of these some are the same in genus, which have differences from belonging to other things, or from subsisting differently, e. g. why is there an echo, or why is there a reflection, term, or of which the one is subjected to the other.
and why a rainbow ?
for all these are the same problem in genus, (for all are reflection,) but they differ in species.
1
Other problems differ from the medium being contained under another medium, as why does the Nile have a greater flow during the fall of the month?
2 because the fall of the month is more winterly:
but why is the fall more winterly ?
because the moon fails, for thus do these subsist towards each other.
SOME one may perhaps doubt concerning cause and that of which it is the cause, whether when the effect is inherent, the cause also is inherent, as if the leaves fall from a tree, or there is an eclipse, will there also be the cause of the eclipse, or of the fall of the leaves ?
As if the cause of this, is the having broad leaves, but of an eclipse ].
Solution of a difficulty-the middle term should always express the cause of the in­ ference.
(Cf. Aldrich's Log., p. 104, Mansel's ed. and Wallis's Log.) the interposition of the earth, for if this be not so, something else will be the cause of these, and if the cause is present, at the same time the effect will be, thus if the earth be interposed, there is an eclipse, or if a tree have broad leaves, it sheds them.
But if this be so, they would be simultaneous, and de­ monstrated through each other, for let the leaves to fall be A, the having broad leaves B, and a vine C, if then A is present with B, (for whatever has broad leaves sheds them,) but B is present with C, for every vine has broad leaves, A is present with C, and every vine sheds its leaves, but the cause is B, * Example (1.) the middle.-
We may also show that the vine has broad leaves, from its shedding them, for if D be what has broad leaves, E to shed the leaf, F a vine, E then is present with F, (for every vine sheds its leaf,) but D with E, (for every thing which sheds its leaf, has broad leaves, every vine then has broad leaves, the cause is, its t Example (2.) shedding them.†
Nevertheless if they cannot be the cause of each other, (since cause is prior to that of which it is the cause,) the cause of an eclipse indeed is the interposition of the earth, but an eclipse is not the cause of the earth interposing.
If then the demonstration by cause (shows) why a thing is, but that which is not through cause, that it is, one knows1 indeed that the earth is inter­ posed, but why it is, he does not know.
2
Yet that an eclipse is not the cause of the interposition, but this of an eclipse, is plain, since in the definition of an eclipse, the in­ terposition of the earth is inherent, so that evidently that is known through this,3 but not this through that.
42. There is only one cause of one and the same thing, from which it is inferred.
Or may there be many causes of one thing ?
for if the same thing may be predicated of many primary, let A be present with B a first, and with C another first, and these with D E, A then will be present with D E, but the cause why it is with D will be B, and C the cause why it is with E, hence from the existence of the cause there is necessarily the ex- istence of the thing, but when the thing exists, it is not ne.
cessary that every cause should exist, still some cause indeed, yet not every cause.
Or if the problem is always universal, is the cause also a certain whole, and that of which it is the cause universal ?
1 as to shed the leaf is present definitely with a certain whole,* though there should be species of it,2 and with these universally, i. e. either with plants or with such plants.
t
Hence in these, the medium and that of which it is the cause must be equal, and reciprocate, for instance, why do * Or genus.
t e. g. plants with broad leaves.
the trees shed their leaves?
if indeed through the concre­ tion of moisture, whether the tree casts its leaf, there must of necessity be concretion, or whether there is concretion not in any thing indiscriminately, but in a tree, the latter must necessarily shed its leaf.
WHETHER however may there not be possibly the same cause of the same thing 4 in all things,5 but a different one, or is this impossible ?
or shall we say it cannot happen, if it is demonstrated per se and not by a sign or accident?
6 for the middle is the definition of the extreme, but if it is not thus, (shall we say that) it is possible?
8
We may however consider that of which 9 and to which 10 1.
If the same thing is predi­ cated of many, except there is an accidental demonstration, it must be shown from the same cause.
If the conclu­ sion is equivo­ cal, the middle term will be so.
Cf. An. Post. i. 13. it is the cause by accident, still they do not ap­ pear to be problems,1 but if not, the medium will subsist similarly,2 it indeed they are equivocal, the medium will be equivocal, if however as in genus3 the medium will be similar.
For instance, why is there alternate proportion ?
for there is a different cause in lines, and in numbers, and * From the same medium quoad num­ bers.
t Multiplica­ tion.
Vide Eu­ clid, book v. ‡
In figures.
the same medium so far as they are lines, is differ­ ent,* but so far as it has an increase of the same kind,† it is the same, the like also occurs in all things.
There is indeed a different cause in a different subject, why colour is similar to colour, and figure to figure, for the similar in these is equivocal, for here‡ perhaps it is to have the sides analogous, and the angles equal, but in co­ lours it consists in there being one sense (of their perception) or something else of the kind.
Things however analogically the same, will have also the same medium by analogy, and this § i. e. the mid­ dle. || The major extreme.

is so from cause, § and that of which, || and to which ¶ it is the cause following each other;
but by assuming each singly,.
that of which it is the cause is more widely extended, as for the exter­ nal angles to be equal to four, is of wider exten­ sion than triangle or square, but equal t in all, for whatever have external angles equal to four right, will also have the medium similarly.t
The me­ dium however is the definition of the first ex­ treme,4 wherefore all sciences are produced by definition, thus § Magis com­ mune est.
Buhle. to shed the leaf, is at the same time consequent to the vine, and exceeds, § 5 and to the fig tree, and exceeds, yet does not exceed all (plants), but is equal to them.
If then you take the first middle 1 it is the definition of shedding the leaf, for the first will be the middle of one of them, because all are such, next the middle of this * is, that sap is congealed, or something else of the sort, but what is it to shed the leaf?
it is for the sap to be congealed, at the junction of the seed.

The cause of a plant hav­ ing broad leaves.
we may explain the matter thus:
let A be present with every B, and B with every D, but more extensively, B then will be universal to D, I call that universal which does not reciprocate, † but that the first universal, with which each singular does not reciprocate, but all together reciprocate, and are of similar ex­ tension.
B then is the cause why A is present with D, wherefore it is necessary that A should be more widely extended than B, for if not, why will this { be rather the cause than that ?
§
If then A is present with all those of E, all those will be some one thing different from B,|| for if t Cum latius sit.

3. If the same is predicated of things differing in species, it can be demon­ strated by di­ verse middle terms.
t B.. § A. || viz. D. not, how will it be possible to say that A is present with every thing with which E is, but E not with every thing with which A is ?
for why will there not be a certain cause as there is why A is present with all D ?

of the same thing, †but not to the same in spe­ cies, ‡ for instance, the cause why quadrupeds are long-lived, is their not having bile, but why birds live long, their being of a dry complexion, or something else :
if however they do not arrive immediately at an individual, § and there is not one medium only, but many, || the causes also are many.
¶*
As to D. 1.
The middle term ought to be the nearest to the singular to which it is cause.
t As B. IA. $ In D. I Example (I.)WHICH of the media is the cause to singulars,* whether that which belongs to the first universal, or that to the singular ?
Evidently the nearest to the singular to which it is caused
For this is the cause why the first,t under the universal, ‡ is inherent, § C is the cause that B is inherent in D, hence C is the cause why A is inherent in D, but B is the cause why it is in C, yet to this it­ self is the cause.
2||CONCERNING syllogism then and demonstration, what either of them is, and how it is produced, is clear, and at the same ¶ Taylor and Buhle annex time about demonstrative science, for it is the same :
¶ 3 but about principles, how they become known, and what is the habit which recognises them, is manifest hence to those who have pre­ viously doubted it.
That it is then impossible to have scientific Knowledge through demonstration, without a knowledge of first immediate principles, has been elucidated before,1 still some one may doubt the knowledge of immediate principles, both whether it is the same or not the same, * also whether there is a science of each or not, t or a science of one, but a different kind (of science) of another, and whether non-inherent habits are ingenerated,t or when inherent are latent.
2
If then, indeed, we possess them,§ it is absurd, for it happens that it (the principle) escapes those who have a more accurate knowledge than demonstration,3 but if not having them before, we acquire them, how can we know and learn without pre-existent knowledge ?
for this is impossible, as we said also in the case of demonstration.
It is evident then, that they || can neither be possessed, nor ingenerated in the ignorant, and in those who this sentence to the preceding chapter.

cording to accuracy than these.
Now this ap­ pears inherent in all animals, for they have an innate power, which they call sensible percep­ tion,* but sense being inherent in some animals, a permanency of the sensible object is engen­ dered, but in others it is not engendered.!
Those, therefore, wherein the sensible object does not re­ main, either altogether or about those things which do not remain, such have no knowledge with­ out sensible perception, but others when they per­ ceive, retain one certain thing in the soul.
t
Now since there are many of this kind, a certain differ­ ence exists, so that with some, reason is produced from the permanency § of such things,|| but in others it is not.
IT
From sense, therefore, as we say, memory is produced, but from repeated re­ membrance of the same thing, we get experience, for many remembrances in number constitute one experience.
From experience, however, or from every universal being at rest in the soul,.
that one besides the many, which in all of them is one and the same, the principle of art and science arises, if indeed it is conversant with generation, † of art, but if with being, of science.
1
Neither, therefore, are definite habits inherent,‡ nor are they produced from other habits more known, but from sensible perception, as when a flight occurs in battle, if one soldier makes a stand, another stands, and then another, until the fight is restored.
But the soul has such a state of being, as enables it to suffer this,.
what, however, we have before said, but not clearly, let us again explain.
When * So as to re­ tain many suc­ cessive images.
one thing without difference abides, there is (then) first, uni­ versal in the soul,1 (for the singular indeed is perceived by sense, but sense is of the universal, as of man, but not of the man Callias,) again, in these f it stops, till individuals‡ and universals stop,§ 2 as such a kind of animal, until animal,|| and in this IT again (it stops) after a similar manner.-
It is manifest then that primary things become necessarily known to us by induction, for thus sensible perception produces the universal.
But since, of those habits which are about intellect, by which we ascertain truth, some are always true, but others admit the false, as opinion, and reasoning,3 but science, and intellect, are always t In these most spe­ cial species.

§ In the soul || Supply, is permanent in the soul.

* Until some­ thing else is permanent in the soul, as " living." true, and no other kind of knowledge, except intellect, is more accurate than science, but the principles of demon­ strations are more known, and all science is connected with reason, there could not be a science of principles :
but since nothing can be more true than science except intellect, 4. Intelle:
t alone conver­ sant with, and itself the prin­ ciple of science.
All science through de­ monstration knows the ob­ jecta of science.
intellect will belong to principles, and to those who consider from these it is evident also, that as demonstration is not the principle of demonstra­ tion, so neither is science the principle of science.
If then we have no other true genus (of habit) besides science, intellect will be the principle of science :
it will also be the principle (of the know­ ledge) of the principle, but all this subsists similarly with respect to every thing.
