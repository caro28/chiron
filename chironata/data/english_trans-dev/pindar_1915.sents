IN preparing the following prose translation, I have endear­ voured to exhibit such a rendering of the text as I should myself have been glad to have, when preparing for a Uni­ versity Examination.
Any one who is at all acquainted with the difficulty of the author, will readily pardon my having in no case ventured to substitute any phraseology of my own for what I be­ lieved to be the literal meaning.
I have to express the greatest possible obligations to the commentaries of Boeckh and Dissen, but for the assistance of which I should hardly have ventured on my present task.
Many thanks are also due for the aid afforded by Mr. Cookesley's excellent notes, as well as those of Dr. Donald­ son.
I have, I trust, in every instance, acknowledged my obligations.
If I have in any degree succeeded in presenting the student with a not-unworthy representation of Pindar's meaning, the merit is mainly to be attributed to these resources and to the great kindness of three excellent friends, the Rev. J. Lonsdale, M.A., Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford;
the Rev. John G. Sheppard, M.A., 2nd Master of Repton School, and late Fellow of Wadham College ;
and Mr. J. LL Davies, B.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam­ bridge ;
who have given me the benefit of their revision and correction throughout the whole work.
With the few exceptions pointed out as they occur, I have followed the text of Bergk, from whom the Prefaces also are taken.
Dr. Donaldson had set me the example of adopting the Introductions of the Odes from Dissen's Commentary.
SINCE the prose portion of this volume was completed, the publisher has obtained permission from the executors of the late Mr. Abraham Moore to reprint his excellent metrical version, and accordingly has the pleasure of adjoining it.
As this version is distinguished for poetry, scholarship, and taste, and is besides among the rarest and most expensive volumes of our modern literature, the literary public will have reason to be satisfied with its reproduction on such advantageous terms.
YORK STREET, October 31st 1851.THE
Olympic Festival was a Pentaeteris (πενταευηρίς), that in.
according to the ancient mode of reckoning, a space of four years elapsed between each festival, in the same way as there was only a space of two years between a Trieteris.
It was celebrated on the first full moon after the summer sol­ stice.
It lasted, after all the contests had been introduced, five days, fromthe 11th to the 15th days of the month inclusive.
The fourth day of the festival was the 14th of the month, which was the day of the full moon, and which divided the month into two equal parts.
The festival was under the immediate superintendence of the Olympian Zeus, whose temple at Olympia, adorned with the statue of the god made by Phidias, was one of the most splendid works of art in Greece.
There were also temples and altars to other gods.
The festival itself may be divided into two parts-the games or contests (ἀγὼν 'Ολυμπιακός), and the festive rites (ἑορτή);
connected with the sacrifices, with the processions, and with the public banquets in honour of the conquerors.
The contests consisted of various trials of strength and skill, which were increased in number from time to time.
There were in all twenty-four contests, eighteen in which men took part, and six in which boys engaged, though they were never all exhibited at one festival, since some were abolished almost immediately after their institution, and others after they had been in use only a short time.
We subjoin a list of these from Pausanias, with the date of introduction of each, commencing from the Olympiad of Coræbus :
—1st.
The foot-race (δρόμος), which was the only contest during the first 13 Olympiads.
2nd.
The δίαυλος, or foot-race, in which the stadium was traversed twice, first introduced in Olympiad 14.
3rd.
The δόλιχος, a still longer foot-race than the δίαυλος, introduced in Olympiad 15.
4th. Wrestling (πάλη);
and 5th.
The Pentathlum (πένταθλον), which consisted of five exercises, viz.
leaping, the foot-race, the throwing the discus, the throwing the spear, and wrestling;
both introduced in Olympiad 18.
6th. Boxing (πυγμή), introduced in Olympiad 23.
7th. The chariot-race, with four full-grown horses (ἵππων τελείων δρόμος, ἅρμα), introduced in Olympiad 25.
8th. The Pancratium (παγκρά­ ιον), consisting of boxing and wrestling;
and 9th.
The horse-race (ἵππος κέλης), both introduced in Olympiad 33.
10th and 11th.
The foot-race and wrestling for boys, intro­ duced in Olympiad 37.
12th.
The Pentathlum for boys, introduced in Olympiad 38, but immediately afterwards abolished.
13th. Boxing for boys, introduced in Olym piad 41.
14th.
The foot-race, in which men ran with the equipments of heavy-armed soldiers (τω̃νὁπλιτω̃ν δρόμος), introduced in Olympiad 65, on account of its training men for actual service in war.
15th.
The chariot-race -with mules (ἀπήνη), introduced in Olympiad 70;
and 16th.
The horse-race with mares (κάλπη), introduced in Olympiad 71 ;
both of which were abolished in Olympiad 84.

18th and 19th.
The contests of heralds (κήρυκες) and trumpeters (σαλπιγκταί), introduced in Olympiad 96.
20th.
The chariot-race with four foals (πώλων ἅρμασιν), introduced in Olympiad 99.
21st.
The chariot-race with two foals (πώλων συνωρίς), intro­ duced in Olympiad 128.
22nd.
The horse-race with foals (πώλος κέλης), introduced in Olympiad 131.
23rd.
The Pancratium for boys, introduced in Olympiad 145.
24th.
There was also a horse-race (ἵππος κέλης), in which boys rode, but we do not know the time of its introduction.
The judges in the Olympic Games, called Hellanodicæ ('Ελλανοδίκαι), were appointed by the Eleans, who had the regulation of the whole festival.
It appears to have been originally under the superintendence of Pisa, in the neigh­ bourhood of which Olympia was situated;
but after the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, on the return of the Heraclidæ, the Ætolians, who had been of great assist­ ance to the Heraclidæ, settled in Elis, and from this time the Ætolian Eleans obtained the regulation of the festival, and appointed the presiding officers.
The Hellanodicæ were chosen by lot from the whole body of the Eleans.
Their number varied at different periods, but at a later time there were eight Hellanodicæ.
The office, probably, lasted for only one festival.
They had to see that all the laws relating to the games were observed by the competitors and others, to determine the prizes and to give them to the conquerors.
An appeal lay from their decision to the Elean senate.
Under the direction of the Hel­ lanodicæ were a certain number of Alytæ (ἀλύται), with an Alytarches (ἀλυτάρχης) at their head, who formed a kind of police, and carried into execution the commands of the Hellanodicæ.
There were also various other minor officers under the control of the Hellanodicæ.
All free Greeks were allowed to contend in the games, who had complied with the rules prescribed to candidates.
The equestrian contests were necessarily confined to the wealthy;
but the poorest citizens could contend in the athletic games.
This, however, was far from degrading the games in public opinion;
and some of the noblest as well as meanest citizens of the state took part in these contests.
The owners of the chariots and horses were not obliged to contend in pe ;
and the wealthy vied with one another in the number and magnificence of the chariots and horses which they sent to the games.
All persons who were about to contend, had to prove to the Hellanodicæ that they were freemen, and of pure Hel­ lenic blood;
that they had not been branded with atimia, nor guilty of any sacrilegious act.
They further had to prove that they had undergone the preparatory training (πργυμνάσματα) for ten months previously.
All competitors were obliged, thirty days before the festival, to undergo certain exercises in the Gymnasium, at Elis, under the super­ intendence of the Hellanodicæ.
The competitors took their places by lot.
The herald then proclaimed the name and country of each competitor.
When they were all ready to begin the contest, the judges exhorted them to acquit them­ selves nobly, and then gave the signal to commence.
The only prize given to the conqueror was a garland of wild olive (κότιος), cut from a sacred olive-tree, which grew in the sacred grove of Altis, in Olympia.
The victor was originally crowned upon a tripod covered over with bronze, but after­ wards upon a table made of ivory and gold.
Palm branches.
the common tokens of victory on other occasions, were placed in his hands.
The name of the victor, and that of his father and of his country, were then proclaimed by a herald before the representatives of assembled Greece.
The festival ended with processions and sacrifices, and with a public banquet given by the Eleans to the conquerors in the Prytaneium.
The most powerful states considered an Olympic victory, gained by one of their citizens, to confer honour upon the state to whic' he belonged ;
and a conqueroi usually had humanities and privileges conferred upon him by the grati­ tude of his fellow citizens.
On his return home the victor entered the city in a triumphal procession, in which his praises were celebrated, frequently in the loftiest strains of poetry.
The Olympic games were celebrated once in four years.
They lasted for five days, and terminated on the full moon which succeeded the summer solstice.
Contrasted with the particular eras which served for the chronological arrange­ ment of events in distinct provinces of Greece, the epoch supplied by their celebration to all the inhabitants of the Hellenic soil deserves peculiar attention.
While the suc­ cession of Priestesses of Juno at Argos, while the Ephors at Sparta, and the Archons at Athens, furnished to those states respectively the basis of their chronological systems ;
it was not a personage invested with a civil or sacerdotal character, who gave his name, not merely to the single years, but to the quadrennial periods of the whole of Greece;
it was he who was proclaimed victor, not in the chariot race of the Hippodrome, but as having outrun his rivals in the stadium at Olympia.
A reflection on the rapid course of time (the great racer in the stadium of the world) might well be suggested by such a practice;
but it is more remarkable, as illustrating the regard paid, by the unanimous consent of all the states of Greece, to those exercises of physical force, which preserved them so long from the corruptions of luxury and effeminacy, into which, through their growing opulence and familiarity with oriental habits, they would very soon otherwise have fallen.
Olympia was the Palæstra of all Greece.
The simplicity of the prizes, the antiquity of their institution, the sacred ceremonies with which they were conducted ;
the glory which attached not merely to the victor, but to his parents.
his friends, and country;
his canonization in the Greek calendar;
the concourse of rival tribes from every quarter of the Greek continent and peninsula to behold the contests and to applaud the conqueror ;
the lyric songs of poets ;
the garlands showered upon his head by the hands of friends, of strangers, and of Greece herself;
the statue erected to him in the precincts of the consecrated grove, by the side of princes, of heroes, and of gods;
the very rareness of the celebration, and the glories of the season of the year at which it took place, when all the charms of summer were poured upon the earth by day, and the full orb of the moon streamed upon the olive groves, and the broad flood of the Alpheius by night;
these were influences which, while they seemed to raise the individual to an elevation more than human, pro­ duced a far more noble and useful result than this,-that of maintaining in the nation a general respect for a manly and intrepid character, and of supporting that moral dignity and independence, which so long resisted the aggressions of force from without, and were proof against the contagion of weak and licentious principles within.

100—end :
Return to the praise of Hiero ;
prayer for his prosperity.
BEST of all things is water, and gold shines far above all haughty wealth as blazing fire shines in the night;
but if thou wishest to tell of victories, my heart, seek no bright star during the day, in the desert air, more genial than the sun;
nor can we sing of a contest higher in rank than Olympia's, whence the renowned hymn has power over the minds of the wise, so that they sing the Son of Cronos, coming to the blest wealthy dwelling of Hiero—who wields the righteous sceptre in Sicily rich in sheep, plucking the highest of all virtues ;
a and he is adorned also with the flower of music, in such strains as we poets round the hospitable table often sing.
But from the peg take down the Dorian lyre, if at all the glory of Pisa and Pherenicus hath subjected thy mind to the influence of sweetest thoughts, when by the Alpheus he rushed, displaying in the course a body ungoaded, and blended with victory his lord, the Syracusian monarch re­ joicing in the steed.
And for him (the monarch) glory shines in Lydian Pelops' colony abounding in brave men [i. e. in Pisa],—Pelops, whom earth-surrounding Poseidon of mighty strength loved from the time when Clotho raised him from the unsullied urn,b well furnished as to his resplendent shoulder with ivory.
Surely many things are wonderful, and in these sometimes fables, adorned beyond the truth with varied falsehoods, deceive tte report of mortals.c
And tho Grace, that procureth all the sweets for mortals, bestowing authority bath brought about that the incredible should often come to be believed;
but after-days are the best con­ vincers.
Now it is becoming to a man to speak what is good con­ cerning the deities, for so is blame the less.
0 son of Tan­ talus, I will record thy story, not as men of yore have done, how when thy sire invited the gods to that most holy ban­ quet, and to friendly Sipylus, offering a return of feasts to the gods, then that he of the bright trident seized thee, and, tamed in his soul by love, bore thee away on his gold-decked steeds to the palace of Zeus the far-honoured, where in after­ time came Ganymede to the same office.
But when thou hadst vanished, nor did the men, after much search, bring thee to thy mother, forthwith did some one of the envious neighbours say that the gods had cut thee limb by limb intod the strength of water boiling with fire, and on the tables around they distributed among themselves the sodden morsels of thy flesh, and ate.
But to me it is impossible to call any of the blessed ones a glutton;
I stand aloof from such a thought.
Losse often befalls the slander­ ous.
But, yet, if the guardians of Olympus honoured any mortal man, it was this Tantalus;
but he could not bear meekly great prosperity;
but through pride and surfeit drew upon himself immense calamity, which the Father hung over him, a mighty stone for him, which ever eagerly desiring to remove from his head, he is a stranger to happiness.
This helpless constantly-wretched life he has, a fourth affliction with three others, because that having stolen the nectar and ambrosia of the immortals with which they had made him imperishable, he gave it to his comrade boon companions;
but if any one expects to escape the notice of the Deity in doing aught, he errs.
Therefore the immortals sent back his son again to the short-lived race of men.
But when, about the time of blooming youth, down began to shade his chin so as to make it dark, he meditated to obtain in contest the proffered marriage, the renowned Hippodameia, from her Plan sire.
And having approached near the hoary sea alone in the night, he called upon the deep-sounding lord of the goodly trident, and he straightway appeared to him close at hand.
To whom, then, he spake, “If, 0 Poseidon, the pleasing gifts of Cypria at all contribute to thy pleasure, impede the brazen spear of Œnomaus, and me in swiftest chariot speed oil to Elis, and bring me near to victory.
Since having destroyed thirteen hero-suitors he defers the marriage of bia daughter;
but great danger admits not a cowardly man.
But one of those who needs must die, why should he sitting at his ease in obscurity in vain cherish without a name his old age, deprived of all praise ?
But to me this combat shall be submitted, and do thou grant a favourable issue."
Thus he spoke, nor did he apply himself to fruitless prayers ;
and him the god honoured, and gave him a golden car, and steeds unwearied with their wings.
f
And he conquered the might of Œnomaus, and won the maiden consort, and begat six lordly sons dear to the virtues.
But now he is mingled withg splendid offerings of blood, lying by the stream of the Alpheus, holding a much-frequented tomb near the altar thronged by strangers.
But the glory shines afar of the Olympic games in the race-courses of Pelops, where swiftness of feet contends, and the height of strength stout at work ;
and he who wins hath for the remainder of his life delightful calm, as far as his contests for the prize can give it.
hBut the good that ever cometh day by day cometh best to every mortal.
But it is my duty to crown him with an equestrian lay in the Æolian measure , for I feel assured that I shall adoin with my illustrious turns of hymns' no host of all men of the present day more skilled both in the elegancies of life, or more powerful in might.
jThe Deity thy guardian, Hiero, provides for thy pur­ suits, having this care ;
and if he fail not soon, I hope to celebrate a still sweeter tltemek with the swift car, and to come to the sunny Cronius, having found a fitting mode of praise.
Now, for me the muse doth keep a shaft most mighty in strength :
one man is greater than another,1 but in kings the summit rises to the highest point :
m stretch thy views no further.
May it be thy lot for this timen to walk on high, and mine for as long a time to live with conquerors, conspicuous for poetic skill throughout the Greeks in every quarter.

Inscribed to Theron of Agrigentum, conqueror in the chariot-iace :
01. 76, 1. B.C. 476 :
sung probably at a banquet at Agrigentum.1—11 :
Proemium.
Praise of Theron and his family.

The changes and vicissitudes of fortune that befel the race of Cadmus, under which those of Theron's family are tacitly alluded to.

Theron's present and future happiness ;
the happiness of the good in a future state.
83—end :
Conclusion.
Envy is deprecated and the glories of Theron recountes.
YE hymns that rule the lyre, what god, what nero, wnat man shall we celebrate ?
Truly Pisa belongs to Jove, and the Olympic games Heracles founded, from the spoils won in war, and Theron we must celebrate for his victorious four-horse car, just in his reverence towards strangers, a stay of Agragas, flower of noble forefathers, upholding the state.
Forefathers, who, after having suffered many afflictions in their spirit, obtained a sacred home by the river,a and were the eye of Sicily:
a fortunate life, too, attended them, bringing both wealth and grace to crown their inborn virtues.
But 0 Cronian child of Rhea, that presidest over the seat of Olympus and the highest of contests, and the stream of Alpheus, soothed by my strains, propitious, preserve for their sake their paternal soil for the future race.
Of actions once accomplished, whether in justice or against justice, not even Time, father of all things, can render one issue undone;
but with prosperous fortune oblivion may result.
For, conquered by goodly pleasure, inveterate woe expires, when divine Fate sends upwards lofty bliss.
And what I have said agrees witbb the divine daughters of Cadmus, who suffered great sorrows ;
but grievous woe fell before superior good.
There lives among the Olympian gods Semele, the long-haired, who died in the thunder's roar;
but Pallas loves her ever, and Father Zeus much ;
and her ivy­ wreathed son loves her.
They tell, too, that in the sea, amongst the marine daughters of Nereus, imperishable life is appointed to Ino for all time.
Of a surety, to mortals no term of death is clearly fixed, nor when we shall close with enduring goodc a tranquil day, child of the Sun;
but varying at dif­ ferent times do the streams of good fortune and of troubles come about to men.
So Destiny, which sways the ancestral joyous lot of these,d with the heaven-sent bliss brings too some recurring woe at another time ;
from the time when the fated son fell in with Laius, and slew him, and fulfilled the response uttered long ago in Pytho.
And keen-eyed Erinnys, having beheld the crime, destroyed his warlike race with mutual slaughter;
but Thersander was left to Polynices at his fall, honoured in youthful contests and in battles of war, a scion to support the house of the Adrastidæ, whence theye derive the origin of their race.
It is befitting that the son of Ænesidamus should obtain the praises of song and of lyre.
For at Olympia he himself received the gift of honour,f and in Pytho and the Isthmus impartial bestowers of victory g conferred on his co-heir brother wreaths won by the four-horse cars, twelve times running the course.
But success frees from cares him that strives in the contest.
Wealth, when adorned with virtues, conferreth apt occa­ sion of various honours,h suggesting deep and vehement desire for what is praiseworthy, as a bright star, the true light to man :
but if any one be so happy as to possess it,i he knows what will hereafter befall;
that the lawless souls of those who die herej forthwith suffer punishment, and some one beneath the earth pronouncing sentence by dire compul­ sion,k judges the sinful deeds done in this realm of Zeus ;
yet the good, enjoying the light of the sun equally by night and by day, beholdl a life less woe-worn,m not vexing the earth with strength of hands, nor the waters of ocean, by reason of scanty sustenance ;
but with the honoured of the gods, with those, viz.," who ever rejoiced in observance of their oaths,o the good pass a life without a tear;
but they?
endure woe loath­ some to sight.
But as many as have had the steadfastness, tarrying thrice on either side,q to keep their soul altogether from unjust actions, accomplish their way on the path of Zeus to the tower r of Cronus ;
where ocean breezes blow round the island of the blessed, and flowers of gold blaze, some on the ground and some on resplendent trees, and the water feeds others ;
with necklaces of which they intertwine their hands and their heads, according to the just decrees of Rhadaman­ thus.
Rhadamanthus, I say, whom Father Cronus hath as his ready assessor, Cronus, the spouse of Rhea who holds of all the highest throne.
And Peleus, too, and Cadmus, are numbered amongst these;
and there did his mother bring Achilles, after that she had persuaded the heart of Zeus with prayers :
Achilles, who overthrew Hector, the unconquerable immovable pillar of Troy, and gave to death Cycnus and the Æthiopian son of Eos.
There are many swift darts under my elbow, within my quiver.s which have a voice for those with understanding, but to the crowd they need interpreters.
He is gifted with genius who knoweth much by natural talent, but those who have learnt,t boisterous in gabbling, like daws, clamour in fruitless fashion against the divine bird of Zeus.
Keep now the bow on the mark ;
u come, my spirit, whom do we strike at, sending againv shafts of good report from a benevolent spirit ?
At Agragas verily stretching my bow, I will utter an oath-boundw word from a sincere soul, viz., that even for a hundred years that city has brought forth no other hero more beneficent in heart to his friends, or more ungrudging in hand, than Theron.
But envy loves to attack praise, not encountering it fairly,x out from senseless men, which loves to babble and to obscure the noble deeds of the good.?
Since the sand escapes num­ bering, as to our hero, what pleasures he has given to others, who can tell ?zinscribed to the same Theron as the foregoing ode, on account of the same victory:
sung probably at Agrigentum, at the festival of the Theoxenia of the Dioscuri.

The poet prays that his song may be pleasing to the Tyndaridæ.

The olive-wreath- won by Theron leads to a di­ gression on the introduction of the olive into the Peloponnesus, brought by Heracles from the Hyperboreans.
34—end :
The poet returns to the Tyndaridæ, who have granted the victory of Theron to the piety of his family, the Emmenidæ.
I DECLARE that I shall please a the hospitable Tyndaridæ and Helen with beautiful locks, by honouring famed Agragas in having raised aloft the hymn of Olympic victory in honour of Theron ;
the song in honour of unwearied steeds :
so did the muse stand by me propitious, when I had invented a new and sparkling mode, to adapt to the Dorian rhythm, the voice of glorious revelry.
bSince the wreaths placed on his (Theron's) flowing hair, exact of me this divinely-imposed debt, that I should with fitting skill blend for the son of Ænesidamus the lyre with varied tones, and the loud sound of flutes and well-arranged words;
c and Pisa exacts a debt of me to sing,d Pisa, I say, from which celestial strains flow to men, for whomsoever the unerring Æolian judge, the national umpire of Greece, doth cast above his eyelids around his locks the grey-coloured ornament of olive ;
the olive which formerly the son of Am­ phitryon brought from the shady fountains of Ister, fairest memorial of the contests in Olympia ;
having persuaded by words the Hyperborean race, the worshippers of Apollo, he with kindly feelings asked for the thronged e and sacred lawn of Zeus a shady plant, common gift to men and the crown of valour.
For already to him, the altars having been con­ secrated to his sire, the full moon f in her golden car had lighted up opposite to him at evening her full eye ;
and he (Heracles) had instituted the upright decision of mighty games, and the fifth-yearly festival as well, on the hallowed craggy banks of Alpheus.
But the district of Cronian Pelops did not yet grow fair trees in its glens :
bare of these, the sweet spot seemed to him to be subject tog the sharp rays of the sun.
So then his mind was set, so as to make him go to the Istrian land:
there Latona's daughter, that driveth the steed, received him as he came from the ridges and winding dells of Arcadia, at the time when, at the bidding of Eurystheus, necessity im­ posed by Zeus his sire, urged himh to go to bring the hind with horns of gold, which formerly Taygeta, having given in recompense to Orthosian Diana, inscribed as sacred to her.
In pursuit of which, he beheld even that laud behind the breath of cold Boreas.
There fixed, he stood in wonder at the trees.
Of these sweet desire possessed him to plant some around the twelve-times-encircled boundary of the goal.
And now to this festivalj he cometh propitious, with the godlike twin sons of deep-girded Led'a ;
for to them he, when going to Olympus, gave charge to preside over the wondrous strife, both as regards the valour of men, and chariot-driving, that whirls the car along.
k
Me then my soul urges on to say, that to the Emmenidæ and to Theron glory has come, the well-horsed sons of Tyndarus granting it,1 because of all mortals they honour themm with most numerous hospitable boards ;
with pious disposition observing the solemn rites of the blessed ones.
If water excels among the elements, and gold be the most honoured n prize of wealth, then does Theron, arriving at the utmost bound by his virtues, reach by his inborn excellence o the pillars of Heracles:
P what is beyond is inaccessible both to wise and foolish :
I will not pursue it;
I should surely be vain to try.

RECEIVE, 0 daughter of Ocean,a with gracious heart this hymn, the honourb of lofty achievements and of the crowns won at Olympia, and the gift of the victorious car of Psaumis;
who, ennobling thy city Lhe nurse of people, hath honoured the six double altars at the great festivals of the gods with the sacrifice of oxen, and at the five-day contests of games, with chariots of horses and mules and with the steed that runs single:
and on thee has laid a fair glory by his victory, and proclaimed by the herald's voice his father Acron and thy newly-established seat.
And coming from the much-loved dwellings of Œnomaus and Pelops, 0 Pallas, protectress of cities, he sings in praise of thy holy groved and the river Oanis, and the lake hard by, and the sacred channels of the stream, with which Hip­ paris waters the people,e and unitesf quickly a high-grown forest of solid buildings, raising from poverty g this town of citizens to power.
Ever for the sake of the praise of noble deeds do toil and expense contend against a deed enveloped in danger ;
but those who are successful are thought even to be wise by their citizens.
O Saviour Zeus, that dwellest high in the clouds, and inhabitest the Cronian hill, and honourest the wide-flowing Alpheus, and the holy Idæan cave !
I come, thy suppliant, calling upon thee withh pipes that utter a Lydian strain, to entreat of thee to embellish this city with a noble race of men,1 and that a tranquil old age may bring thee, 0 Olympian victor, delighting in the horses of Poseidon, to thy end, with thy sons, 0 Psaumis, standing near thee.j
But if any one cherishesk honest wealth, having enough of possessions,l and add thereto fair fame, let him not covet to become a god.

71-end :
Returns to Agesias and his victories.
Exhortation to AEneas, the leader of the chorus, to show that the ancient reproach against the Bœotians is misapplied, and to sing the praises of Syracuse and Ortygia.
As when we build a a magnificent palace, placing gilded columns under the close vestibule of the mansion, so will we construct the portalb of this ode :
when we commence a work we should make the facing c splendid.
If there be one who has won at Olympia, and minister too at the oracular altar of Zeus in Pisa, and enrolled among the founders of re­ nowned Syracuse, what praise can that man avoid, if he meet with the sweet songs d of unenvying citizens ?
Let the son of Sostratus know that he has his lucky foot in this sandal.
Achievements unaccompanied with danger are honoured, wither when performed among men nor in the hollow ships ;
e but if aught noble be done with toil, many mention it.
0 Agesias, for thee the same praise is ready at hand,f which, in former time, Adrastus in justice openly pronounced upon the seer Amphiaraus, the son of Oecleus, when earth had seized upon g both him and his white steeds.
Then after the dead bodies of seven funeral pyres had been consumed, the son of Talaus spoke, near Thebes, some such speech as this :
" I lament the eye of my army, both a good seer, and good too to fight with the lance."
This too belongs to the Syracusian hero, the lord of the revel.
Though neither con­ tentious nor fond of strife, and having sworn a mighty oath, I will yet clearly testify to this for his sake ;
and the muses with dulcet strain will permit me to do so.
Come, 0 Phintis, yoke for me now the strength of mules, with all speed, that in the illustrious h path of poetry we may make the car to go, and I may arrive even at the origin i of these heroes :
for they,j beyond all others, know to lead this road, since they won the wreaths in Olympia :
therefore to them we should throw open the gates of song.
To Pitana by the ford of the Eurotas must we come to-day betimes- Pitana,k who verily, after intercourse with Poseidon, son of Cronus, is said to have borne a dark-haired child, Evadne.
But she concealed the unborn child, conceived not in wed­ lock, by the folds of her garment ;
l and on the appointed month, sending her attendants, she bade them give the child to take care of to the hero the son of Elatus, who ruled the Arcadians in Phcesana, and had his lot to dwell on the Alpheus :
there reared, she first tasted the sweets of love in Apollo's arms.
But she did not for her full time escape the eye of Æpytus, trying to conceal the seed of the god;
but he departed on his road to Pytho, m repressing in his mind with acute earnestness wrath unutterable;
departed, I say, to inquire of the oracle concerning this intolerable calamity.
Meantime she (Evadne).
laying aside her girdle woven with purple woof, and silver ewer, under dark bushes brought forth a boy instinct with divinity.
To her the deity of the golden locksn sent to assist her gentle Ilithyia and the Fates ;
and from her womb, and from the yearning pang of child- birth, came forth Iamus to light at once :
° him, distracted with grief, she left upon the ground ;
and by the decrees of the deities, two bright-eyed serpents caring for him,P nourished him with the harmless poison of bees.
But the king, when he arrived, driving his car from stony Pytho, inquired of all in his house who might be the child .
that Evadne had borne;
for he asserted that he was born with Phœbus for his sire, and that he would be to the dwellers upon earth a seer superior above all mortals, nor that ever would his race fail.
Thus, indeed, did he declare;
but they then avouched not to have seen or heard him, now five days born.
But he lay hid among the rushes and in impervious brakes, covered thickly, as to his delicate body, with the yellow and empurpled rays of the wall-flower;
wherefore she uttered the propitious word q that he should be for ever called by this undying name.
He, when he had received the fruit of golden-crowned youth, descending by night into the midst of the Alpheus, under the open sky, called upon Poseidon the widoly­ mighty, his ancestor, and the bow-bearing guardian of heaven-founded Delos, asking for himself some officer useful to the people.
8
And the sure paternal voice answered him, and addressed him ;
t "
Arise, my child, come hither, to go u to the land common to all, following my voice.
"Then they came to the steep rock of lofty Cronus :
there the god granted him a double treasure of divination ;
first to hear the voice that knows not falsehood, and next when daring Heracles, noble offspring of the AEacidae, should found for his father the thronged festival and the mightiest law of games, then he (Apollo) commanded him (Iamus) to establish an oraclev on the upper part of the altar of Zeus.
From which time, much renowned through­ out the Greeks is the race of the Iamidæ.
Wealth too followed ;
and honouring worth w they come into a glorious path.x
The deed proves each man what he is :
censure from others who are envious overhangs them, on whom, first driving round the twelfth course, the honoured goddess of victory sheds a goodly shape.
yBut if, of a truth, 0 Agesias, thy maternal grandsires,2 dwelling beneath the mountains of Cyllene, have, with supplicatory sacrifices, many a time, and with many of them, piously gifted Hermes the herald of the gods ;
Hermes, who rules the games and the lot of the prizes, a and favours Arcadia, nurse of heroes, then it is he, 0 son of Sostratus, who, with his heavily-thundering father, ordains success to thee.
I fancy I have upon my tongue a sharp-sounding whet­ stone,b which fancy creeps over me willing amongst sweet- flowing songs.
cMy grandam was the Stymphalian Metopa with its flowery banks,d who bore equestrian Theba, whose pleasant watere I drink,f when I weave a varied hymn for warrior heroes :
urge on now thy choir, 0 Æneas, first to sing aloud of Parthenian Here, and then to knows whether in truth we escape the ancient reproach, "Bœotian swine !”h For thou dost cany my message well, i thou art the interpreter of the fair-haired Muses,j the sweet mixing-cup of loudly-sounding songs.
kBid them too make mention of Syracuse and Ortygia, ruling which with upright sceptre, and with his soul intent on just deeds, Hiero waits on ruddy-footed Demeter and the feast of her daughter borne by snowy steeds and the might of Ætnæan Zeus.
Him do the sweet-speaking lyres and songs acknowledge :
may time as it comes on never overthrow his bliss!
But, with pleasant welcome,l may he receive the festal procession of Agesias, that cometh from the walls of Stymphalus, from home to home,m leaving the mother of fleecy Arcadia.n
Two anchors are useful to have fastened from the swift ship in a stormy night.
May the Deity propitious grant glorious the lot of these,o and of those.?
Sovereign Lord of the Ocean, grant a direct course free from peril to Agesias on his return, 0 thou that art the spouse of Amphitrite with the golden distaff, and glorifyq the sweet bloom of my hymns.

Return to the victories of Diagoras, and prayers for his prosperity.
As when a man, taking from his rich hand a chalice, bub­ bling within with the juice of the vine, presents it to his youthful son-in-law, drinking to his health, passing from one house to another the golden chalice which is the costliest of his possessions, and he honours the glory of the feast and his own relation, and in the midst of his friends he makes him an object of admiration for his happy marriage,a so I too sending to victorious heroes the nectar poured forth, the Muses' gift, sweet fruit of talent, I cheer them,b sending it, I say, to the conquerors at Olympia and at Pytho.
Happy is he whom good report befalls:
one man at one time and one at another does life-infusing gracec kindly regard, along with the lyre and the voiceful instruments of the pipes.
And now, to the sound of both, I have gone tod Rhodes, hymning with Diagoras the ocean Rhodes, daughter of Aphrodite and bride of the Sun, that I may praise, in recompense for his boxing, both the resolute huge hero, who won for himself a crown on Alpheus and Castalia, and his father Demagetus, dear to justice ;
who inhabit, with Argive warriors, the three-citied isle, near the promontory of spacious Asia.
I shall willingly endeavour for them, from their origin even from Tlepolemus, publicly proclaiming it, to raise a common panegyric, viz., for the powerful race of Heracles ;
e for on the father's side they boast to be descended from Zeus, and partly they are Amyntor's offspring on the mother's side, from Astydameia.
But round the minds of men hang errors numberless, and this is impossible to dis­ cover, what now and at the end too is best for a man to gain.
For the settler of this land f in past time, moved with passion, slew in Tiryns, smiting him with the staff of hard olive, Licymnius, the base-born brother of Alemena, who had come from the palace of Midea.
But the passions of the soul lead astray even the wise.
Having come then to the deity, he consulted the oracle :
and on him the golden-haired god, from his incense-breathing shrine enjoined a straight g voyage from the shore of Lerna to the sea-girt district,h where formerly the mighty monarch of the gods bathed the dwellings of men' with snow-flakes of gold, at the time when, by the art of Hephæstus and his brazen-forged axe, atj the summit of her father's head, Athene, springing upwards, shouted with an exceeding great cry :
and Heaven and mother Earth shud­ dered at her.
Then, too, the son of Hyperion, the deity that giveth light to mortals, enjoined on his children dear to observe the soon-approaching duty, that for this goddess they might be the first to establish a splendid altar, and by instituting holy sacrifice, might gladden the mind of the father, and of the maid that thunders with the spear.
Heed to the prudent one,k hath spread amongst men1 courage and joy ;
m and yet does the cloud of oblivion advance bafllingly, and wrests from the mind the straight path of action.
For these went up, and the seed of blazing flame they bore not with them;
but they founded in the citadel of Lindus a sacred lawn, with rites in which no fire was used.
On them Zeus, bringing a yellow cloud, rained much gold, and the goddess of the gleaming eyes herself granted them by their excellently-working hands to surpass those who dwell upon the earth in every art.
Then did the paths bear works re­ sembling what was alive and moving,n and their glory was high ;
and, to one who knows, skill in art without the aid of false tricks is preferable.
oThe ancient legends also of men say, that when Zeus and che immortals were portioning out the earth, not as yet was Rhodes to be seen in the ocean flood, but that the island lay hid in the briny depths :
nor of Helios, who was absent, did any one point out the share ;
P and so they left him without a portion of land, him, the pure god.
And for him, when he (Helios) had reminded him, Zeus was again about to cast the lot ;
but he q allowed him not;
since he said he saw within the hoary sea a land rising from the bottom, full of nourish­ ment for men and kindly for flocks.
And forthwith he bade golden-tired Lachesis uprear her hands to heaven,r and not to utter insincerely the mighty oath of the gods, but with the son of Cronus to grant that it,, when raised to the bright air, should hereafter be a possession to himself ;
and the sum of his words found their accomplishment, turning out.
true.
From the watery sea sprang forth the island, and the genial father of the sharp rays of light is lord thereof, he, the com­ mander of the fire-breathing steeds.
There with Rhodes having intercourse of yore, he begot seven sons, who, in the time of the former race of men, were endowed with subtlest skill;
of these one begot Cameirus and Ialysus, the eldest of his children, and Lindus;
and they ruled separately each his portion of the cities,t having divided into three parts the land of their sire ;
and their seats were called by their names.
There (in Rhodes) a sweet atonement u of bitter calamity is appointed unto Tlepolemus, the prince of the Tirynthians,v as unto a god;
both the steaming sacrifice of sheep led in procession and the decision of the contests;
with the wreaths of which Diagoras has twice crowned himself, and in the renowned Isthmus four times conquering, and in Nemea he won w one victory after another,x and in rugged Athens he won the same.y
And the brazen shield z in Argos acknowledged him, and the works of arta of brass in Arcadia and in Thebes, and the regular Bœotian lists and Pellene.
And in Ægina the lists acknowledged him six times pre­ vailing:
in Megara, too, the pillared recordb tells no other tale.
But, 0 Father Zeus, guardian of the ridges of Atabyrius, honour the law of songc in honour of the victory at Olympia, and the hero that bath obtained the glory of valour with the fist, and grant him reverential esteem both from citizens and from strangers;
since he pursues unswervingly a path opposed to arrogance, well-instructed in what an upright mind, inhe­ rited from virtuous forefathers, has given to him.
Throw not into the shade the common offspringd of Callianax.
Conjoined with the joyous festivals of the Eratidæ the city too hath festal banquets;
e but in one and the same brief space of time the shifting breezes change rapidly.
Inscribed to Alcimedon of Ægina, conqueror in the wrestling-match of boys:

The poet commences the praises of the victor and his brother Timosthenes.
21—52 :
The praise of Ægina for the justice and valour of its inhabi­ tants.
53—end:
The poet returns to the praises of the victor and his trainer, Milesias, and ends with prayers for his prosperity.
O OLYMPIA, mother of the golden-crowned games, queen of truth !
where prophetic men, divining by sacrifices, explore the will of Zeus of the bright lightning, if he hath aught to tell concerning men who desire in their soul to obtain the mighty praise of victory and repose from their toils;
and there is an accomplishment granted to prayers in return for the piety of men.
But, 0 Grove of Pisa, abounding with fair trees, on the Alpheus, receive this festal procession and earing of the wreath :
great truly is his renown whom thy lorious meed befalls;
but of blessings different happen to different men, and there are many ways of success, with the favour of the gods.
But thee, U Timosthenes, and thy brother, destiny assigned to Zeus the tutelary god of thy birth, who made thee indeed renowned in Nemea, and hath now made Alcimedon, thy brother, victorious at Olympia near the hill of Cronus.
And he was fair to behold, and, in deeds not disgracing his form, winning in the wrestling- match, he proclaimed Ægina that plyeth the long oar to be his country.
Ægina, where Themis, guardian deity, assessor of Zeus the god of strangers, is honoured in a manner be­ yond what is done by other men.
For in that which is diversified and which inclines in various ways, to judge with upright mind and fairly is a hard task;
a but some law of the immortals has placed this sea-girt country toob as a divinely-appointed protection to stranger-guests of every clime (and may future time ne'er be weary of so doing !), this country, I say, governed by Dorian race since Æacus.
Æacus, whom the son of Latona and wide-ruling Poseidon, when about to construct a circling bulwark for Ilium, called in as their fellow-workman at the wall, because it was fated that if should outbreathe smoke, in the city-wasting battles, when wars arose.
And silvery snakes,d leaping, three in number, to the wall, as soon as it had just been built, two of them fell down, and there on the spot bewildered resigned their breath ;
but one, with a cry of triumph, sprang in ;
and Apollo, pondering in his mind the prodigy, spake at once before them."
Pergamus, where thy hands, 0 hero, have wrought, is to be taken;
thus does the omen of the son of Cronus, deeply- thundering Zeus, sent by him, speak to me :
not without thy descendants;
but it shall be conquered in the first and fourth generations of thy posterity."
Thus, then, the deity, the noble child of Latona, having clearly spoken, hastened in his car to the Xanthus and the Amazons that love the steed.
and to the Ister.
And the trident-wielder directed his swift car to the ocean Isthmus, transporting back Æacus hither,e on his steeds decked with gold, and to the ridge of Coriuth he drove, to view there the famous festival.
And there is nothing pleasant among mortals which will be equally so to all ;
f but if I have retraced in my song the glory of Milesias won among the beardless youths,?
let not envy aim at me with a rough stone ;
for I will alike tell this victoryh at Nemea, and his after-contest gained in the pan­ cratium of men;
but to instruct is, in truth, easier to him that knoweth;
i and it is senseless not to have learned before for the minds of the unskilled are frivolous.
But that mank can furtherl than others declare those means, viz.
what methodm shall most advance a hero who is about to bear off the much-desired glory from the sacred games.
Now is Alcimedon, whom he trained, a glory to him, having won the thirtieth victory;
n Alcimedon, who, favoured by the deity, and not wanting courage, has on the limbs of four youths,o removed from himself P a most hateful return to his home.
and speech dishonoured and the unnoticed road,q and in his father's father he inspired a vigour able to struggle with old age :
truly, he who hath been successfulr forgets the grave.
But I must, awakening the memory of the past, tell of the victorious glory of the hands of the Blepsiadæ, by whom now the sixth wreath from the leaf­ earing contests is worn.
The dead, too, have their share in he praise paid with customary honours,8 and the dust does at hide the illustrious glory of their kindred.t
And Iphion, having heard the joyous news from Proclamation,u daughter of Hermes, can perchance tell to Callimachus the bright onour at Olympia, which Zeus has granted to their race.
But may he be willing to grant them blessings upon bless­ ings, and avert bitter diseases!
I pray that he may not, on account of their glorious lot, make Nemesis adverse, but, bestowing on them a life free from woe, exalt both them and their city to honour.

Locrian legends.
80-end :
The poet returns to Epharmostus, and celebrates at great length his victories and his athletic might.
THE strain of Archilochus sounding forth at Olympia, the thrice-repeated cry of victory with loud tones, might have sufficed to precede in the triumph Epharmostus and his loved compeers, leading the festal procession near the Cronian hill:
butnow, my spirit, with such shafts as these, a from the far­ darting bows of the Muses, aim atb Zeus, lord of the crimson levin, and the holy promontory of Elis, which once the Lydian hero Pelops won, the fairest dower of Hippodameia:
and send a sweet winged shaft to Delphi :
thou wilt not apply thyself to a fruitless theme,c in making the lyre to vibrate for the deeds of wrestling of a hero from far-famed Opus ;
praising her and her son.
Opus, which Themis and her daughter, all-glorious Eu­ nomia, preserver of states, possess, and shed blooms in the honours of victory, both in Cast alia and near the stream of the Alpheus, whence the best of garlands magnify the far- famed mother of the Locrians with beauteous trees.
But 1, illumining the beloved city with bright songs, swifter than the noble steed and winged bark, will send forth this announce­ ment in every quarter, if with any skill given me by heaven,e I tend the choice garden of the Graces ;
f for they grant all that is delightful Men become brave and skilful by the gift of the gods ;
for how else could Heracles have brandished in his hands his club against the trident, when, standing in defence of Pylos, Poseidon pressed him hard, and there pressed him hard Phœbus also warring with a silver bow ;
nor did Hades hold unmoved the staff, with which he leads the mortal corpses of those that die to their subterranean path.
Cast this theme, my tongue, far from me ;
since to blaspheme the gods is a hateful science, and to be loud-tongued out of proper seasons sounds in harmony withh madness.
Babble not such things:
shun to tell of war and strife among the immortals,i and direct the tongue to Protogeneia's city (Opus), where, by the decree of Zeus, who wields the quivering light­ ning, Pyrrha and Deucalion coming down together from Par­ nassus, founded their mansion first, and without marriage- union produced the stony race of the same stock, and hence they were called Laoi.j
Rouse for themk the tuneful breath1 of poetry, and praise wine for being old, but the flower of song for being new.-
They tell that the might of waters had overwhelmed the dark earth, but that the sea-water at Zeus' behest suddenly received an ebb.
From them were your ancestors, bearers of the brazen shield ;
being in origin pens of women of the race of Iapetus, and, on the father's side, sons of the powerful Cronidæ, native kings ever.
In time past, the Lord of Olympus having carried off the daughter of Opus from the land of the Epeans, in quiet had intercourse with her on the Mænalian hills, and brought her to Locrus, lest the course of time, bringing upon him n a death reft of offspring, should carry him off.
But his spouse bore the mighty seed, and the hero was gladdened on seeing his adopted son, and called him so that he should bear the same name as his maternal grandsire, him I say, a hero beyond de­ scription great, both in beauty of form and in valiant deeds.
And he gave him a city and a people to govern :
and strangers flocked to him both from Argos and from Thebes, the Arcadians too, and the men of Pisa.
But the son of Actor and Ægina, Menœtius, of the new­ comers did he especially honour.
Menœtius, whose son, along with the Atreidæ, having come to the plain of Teuthras, stood with Achilles alone, at that time when, having turned the warlike Greeks to flight, Telephus attacked their sea- beaten sterns, so as to show to thoseo of understanding the fierce spirit of Patroclus, so that they should know it.
Whereforep the offspring of Thetis exhorted him never to be ranged in deadly battle apart from his man-slaying spear.
Would that I were inventive in poetry, and worthy to advance in the Muses' car, and might boldness and great power attend me!
But through his friendship and virtue I have come to aid the cause of?
the Isthmian chaplets of Lam­ promachus, when both upon one day won a contest.
Two other successes happened to Epharmostus afterwards at the gates of Corinth, and others too to him in the vale of Nemea.
At Argos, also, he won the prize of men, and wher- a youth he Mon at Athens.
And in Marathon, when taken out from the boys,r what a contest with the elder men did he endure for the silver vessels !
And having subdued heroes with quick- turning art which never fell, he passed through the ring of spectators, with what applause!
in the prime of life, and fair, and having done the fairest deeds.
On another occasion was he seen, an object of marvel to the Parrhasian crowd, at the time of the solemn assembly of Lycæan Zeus ;
and again, when he bore off, at Pellene, the warm cure of wintry breezes :
8 the tomb, likewise, of Iolaus, is a supporter of his glories, and the sea-washed Eleusis.
t
Whatever comes by nature is best:
yet many among men have sought to gain glory by virtues acquired through in­ struction.
But when performed without the deity, each deed becomes none the worse when passed over in silence.
For there are some paths that lead further than others, nor will one single pursuit lead us all to honour.
Excellences of every kind are difficult of attainment;
but bringing forward u this prize of valour, with confidence sound aloud with clear voice that this hero marvellously is gifted with strength of hand, skilful in limb, with looks that breathe valour, who, victorious, has crowned in the feast the altar of Ajax, son )f Oileus.

probably 01. 74, 1. B.C. 484 :
sung at Olympia.1-6 :
Poetry is needed for the praise of noble deeds.
7—end :
After having spoken generally of the utility of songs of triumph, which give lasting existence to fame, the poet gradually returns to Agesi­ damus, to whom he promises an Epinician hymn.
AT one time is there to men the greatest benefit in a winds :
and at another time is there the greatest benefit from the waters of heaven, daughters of the cloud.
But if with toil one be successful in the contest, sweet-toned hymns arise as the foundation of future renown, and are the faithful pledge for deeds of valour.
And this praise, which none can envy,b is stored up for the victors at Olympia ;
whichc our tongue desires to foster ;
but from the Deity alone does a mand flourish ever with poetic genius.
Know then, 0 son of Archestratus.
Agesidamus, that for thy boxing I will sound loudly forth the ornament of a sweet strain over thy crown of most precious olive,e showing my respect to!
the race of Epizephyrian Locrians.
Thither march on in the revel;
I will vouch, 0 Muses, that when you come to themg you will not come to a race that shunneth strangers, nor destitute in the arts of civilized life, but at the summit of wisdom, and warlike.
For their innate disposition, neither can the tawny fox nor the loudly-roaring lions change.
hInscribed to the same person as the preceding ode, and to commemorate the same victory, but not till many years afterwards;
it appears to be a tardy fulfilment of the promise made in that ode, and was sung in the native country of the victor, probably at a banquet given, on the return of the Olympiad, to commemorate his victory.

The poet now sends the long-promised ode-a debt that he had never forgotten, but which he will now repay with usury 10—24 :
The subject of the ode itself ;
the praises of the Locrians and of Agesidamus.
24—75:
Mythical tale of the foundation of the Olympic games by Heracles.
78—end:
The poet returns to the praises of the victor.
READ to me the name of the son of Archestratus who won at Olympia, that I may know where in my heart he has been written.
For being in his debt a sweet strain, I have for­ gotten it.
0 Muse, and thou too, Truth, child of Zeus, with uplifteda hand repel from me the reproach of lying that sins against my friend.
b
For the future, time of payment having approached from afar,d hath made appear shameful my deep debt.
But, nevertheless, beneficial intereste is able to do away with sharp complaint.
Now let us seef where the flowing wave washes downs the rolling pebble,h and where, so as to do a pleasing favour, we shall pay a common praise.
For strict justice presides in the city of the Zephyrian Locrians, and to them Calliope is dear, and brazen Ares.
And the Cycnean fight alsoi routed even the mighty Heracles, and let Agesidamus, the pugilist, victorious in Olympia, pay gratitude to Ilas, his trainer, as did Patroclus to Achilles.
And a man having whetted the spirit of one born to deeds of virtue, may, with the aid of the Deity, set him on his way to extraordinary glory.
But without labour very few have gained this joy, before all exploits a bright happiness to life.
And this prince of all contests the statutes of Zeus have roused me to sing, this contest, I say, which the might of Heracles founded near the ancient tomb of Pelops, when he slew the noble Cteatus, the son of Poseidon, and he slew Eurytus, that of design he might exact of the unwilling mighty Augeas the hire due for his service ;
for them did Teracles, lying in wait under the glades of Cleonæ, overcome upon the road, because before the haughty sons of Molion, sitting in ambush in the defiles of Elis, had destroyed his Tirynthian force.
And of a truth the monarch of the Epeans, the deceiver of his guest, not long after saw his wealthy state sinking into the deep gulf of destruction, amidst cruel fire and strokes of the sword.
But a contest with your betters it is impossible to get rid of ;
j wherefore lie too did not avoid sudden death, having at the last through his folly run in the way of capture.
The valiant son of Zeus, then, having gathered in Pisa his whole army and all his spoil, measured out the hallowed lawn for his mightiest sire ;
and, when he had made a fence all around, he marked out in an open space the Altis, and he appointed the plain round about as a place for banqueting, and honoured the stream of the Alpheus in conjunction with the twelve kingly gods ;
k and he called the hill Cronus;
for in former times, untitled, whilst Œnomaus reigned, it was covered with much snow.
1
And in this initial festival,m the Fates then stood by near at hand, and Time that alone declareth genuine truth.
And he,n advancing on­ wards, has demonstrated the plain truth, how that, when he had divided them to the twelve gods, he sacrificed the gifts of way, the first-fruits;
and how that nexto he established the quinquennial festival simultaneously with the first Olympian sacrifice, and the games in honour of his victory.
Who then hath obtained the recent p crown, by hands, by feet too, and by the car, with glory having acquired for himself victory in the games, having won it in the contest ?
q
Running the race oil foot, CEonus, Licymnius' son, was best in the straight course of the stadium :
he came from Midea, leading an army ;
viz.,for Heracles:
and Echemus was exalting Tegea in the wrest­ ing ;
and Doryclus carried off the prize of boxing, a dweller In the city Tiryns :
with the four steeds, Serous, son of Halirrhothius, from Mantinea, bore off the prize;
and with the javelin, Phrastor hit the mark.
And in distance with the stone, Eniceus cast beyond all, whirling his hand round, and his military companions raised a mighty uproar.
Mean.
while the lovely light of the blight-visaged moon lighted up the evening;
and the whole sacred precinct echoed with jocund songs after the fashion in which a conqueror is praised.
Following therefore former usage, now too, as an honour named after the ennobling victory, we will sing of the thunder-clap, and of the fiery dart hurled from the hand of Zeus who rouseth the thunder, the gleaming lightning joined to every victory.

But as a child, born from a wife, is dear to the father that bath arrived at the age which is the opposite of youth, and greatly warms his soul with love (since wealth that falls to a foreign master, alien to his blood, is most hateful to one that dieth), so too, 0 Agesidamus, when a man, after per­ forming noble deeds without a song,t shall arrive at the mansion of Hades, he, I say, having breathed a useless breath,u has gained but a brief delight as a reward for all his toil.
But over thee the sweet-sounding lyre and dulcet flute shed grace;
and the Pierides, the daughters of Zeus, foster the glory of great deeds, so as to spread it wide.
But I, zealously lending my aid to the work, have em­ bracedv the far-famed land of the Locrians, bedewing the heroic city with honied praise ;
and I have lauded the lovely son of Archestratus, whom I saw winning by the might of his hand near the Olympian altar, at that time both fair in form and blended with the prime of life ;
w—the prime of life, I say, which, with the aid of the Cyprus-born,x once averted remorseless death from Ganymede.

SAVIOUR FORTUNE, child of Eleutherian Zeus,a guard, I beseech thee, potent Himera.
For by thee, in the ocean are guided swift ships, and on the land rapid wars and assemblies fruitful in counsel;
but the hopes of men are tossed about, often aloft and then again down, as they cut the vain sea of error, and no one yet of mortal men hath found a sure markb from the Deity concerning a future event;
but of what is about to happen the knowledge is blind.
And many a thing has fallen out to men contrary to their judgment, the reverse of delight;
and others, who have met with hostile surges, have in a short space exchanged vast good for evil.
cSurely, too, 0 son of Philanor, thy mighty strength of foot, like that of a dunghill cock,d would, by thy paternal hearth, have withered without renown, had not faction, in which man is set against man, deprived thee of thy Cnossian nati ve land.

PRAISING the house that has thrice won at Olympia, the house kind to fellow-citizens and attentive to stranger guests.
I will make knowna the wealthy Corinth, the vestibule of Isthmian Poseidon, rich in fair youths.
For in her Eunomia (Good order) dwells, and her sisters, the firm pedestalb of cities, Justice and concordant Peace, dispensers of wealth to men, golden daughters of Themis, good at counsel;
but they are eager to drive away Insolence, the bold-mouthed mother of Surfeit.
Fair things have I to say, and straightforward confidence prompts my tongue to speak:
and it is impossible to hide our native genius.
And on you, sons of Aletes, have the Hours, rich in flowers, oft shed the triumphal glory of those who surpassed in the sacred games by their supreme excellence, and often in the hearts of men have they implanted quaint inventions ;
but the glory of everythingc belongs to the inventor.
Whence first appeared the festivities of Bacchus with the dithyramb that gains the bull as prize ?
Who added to the bridles of the steeds the means of guiding them, or who placed the twofold king of the birdsd on the temples of the gods?
And therein,e too, the sweetly-breathing Muse blooms, and there Ares flourishes with the deadly spears of youthful heroes.
O sovereign, wide-ruling Lord of Olympus, Father Zeus, mavst thou bear no grudge to what I sing.f and, guiding this people unharmed, speed right on the genial gale of the fortune of Xenophon, and receive at his hand the law of praise for wreaths won,i which he brings from the plains of Pisa, conqueror in the course of the stadium and in the Pen­ tathlum;
honours which no mortal man before has yet met with ;
and two wreaths of parsley have crowned him conspi­ cuous in the Isthmian games;
nor does Nemea set itself against him.
Of his father Thessalus, too, the glory of victory in swift­ ness remains for ever by the streams of the Alpheus, and at Pytho he bath the honour of the stadium and the diaulum won in a single day, and for him during the same month one day of swiftnessj in rugged Athens placed around his locks three most fair crowns of noble deeds, and the Hellotian crowns seven times he placed around his locks.
And in the sea-girt customs of Poseidon k longer hymnsl befel him with his father Ptoidorus and Terpsias, and Eritimus.
And as to how many victories ye won in Delphi and in the lion's feeding-place,- I contend with many" concerning the mul­ titude of their achievements ;

In everything there is a measure, and to understand this fitting measure is most opportune.
And I, in my private capacity, having embarked in a common cause, and cele­ brating the prudence of those of old and their warlike exploits, waged in heroic valour, will not speak falsely aboutP Corinth;
praising both Sisyphus, as a god, most wise in device, and Medea contracting to herself a marriage in oppo­ sition to her father, saviour to the ship Argo and its rowers.
And again too of yore, clothed with might before the walls of Dardanus, they were thoughtq on either side to bring to a decision the issue of battle ;
these on the one side endeavour­ ing with the loved race of A treus to recover Helen;
those on the other side with all their might endeavouring to hinder it;
and the Danai dreaded Glaucus who had come from Lycia.
To them he boasted, that in the city of Pirene was his father's empire and rich inheritance and palace;
his father, who en­ dured very many woes while endeavouring near the springsr to harness Pegasus, son of the snaky Gorgon, before that the maiden Pallas brought him the bridle with frontlet of gold­ from the dream forthwith followed reality-and she cried, " Dost thou sleep, royal son of Æolus?
Come, take this steed-taming spell, and sacrificing a whites bull, lay it beforet thy Damæan sire."
The maiden of the dark shield seemed to say thus much to him as he slept in the night;
and he leapt upright on his feet, and, seizing the wonder that lay near him,u he gladly sought the prophet of the land, and showed to the son of Cœranus the accomplish­ ment of the whole matter;
how that he, at his bidding,v at the altar of the goddess, reposed during the night, and how that the daughter of Zeus, whose lance is the thunderbolt, herself gave him the gold that subdues the steed's heart.
wThe prophet bade him forthwith obey the bidding of the dream, and when he should sacrifice a bull,x a strong-footed one, to the mighty encircler of the earth, straightway to raise an altar to Hippian Athene.
The power of the gods accom­ plishes the act that is beyond an oath to vouch for, and beyond expectation, as an easy matter.
yIn truth the mighty Bellerophon quickly subdued the winged steed, applying to his cheek the calming charm, and having mounted him, he sportively went through the military exercise in full armour.
With his aid too of yore, levelling his darts at the female archer host of the Amazons.
from the cavernous depths of the coldz empty air, he slew them;
and the Chimæra breathing fire, and the Solymi he slew.
His own fate I will conceal in silence ;
but hima in Olympus the ancient stalls of Zeus receive.
But it is right that I, sending straight the whirling flight.
of my darts of poetry, should not hurl most of my javelins with my two hands beyond the mark.
For, obedient to the gloriously-enthroned Muses, I have willingly come to uphold the glory of the Oligæthidæ for their victories at the Isthmus and those in Nemea.
And in a brief song will I make innu­ merable victories to shine conspicuous, and there shall accom­ pany meh the true, sweet-tongued voice, bound by oath, heard sixty times from both spots, of the fortunate herald.
cTheir exploits in Olympia seem already to have been fittingly sung ere now,d but their future deeds thene will I openly declare:
but now indeed I hope for more, yet the issue rests with the Deity;
but if the tutelar deity of their race will continue,f we will give this over to Zeus and Enyalius g to accomplish ;
as they are the patrons of the Olympian and Isthmian games.
And what on the Parnassian crag, and how many in Argos and in Thebes, and how many those which the altar that rises in Arcadia, lord of Lycæus, shall bear witness to, and Pellene too, and Sicyon, and Megara, and the well­ fenced grave of the Æacidæ, and Eleusis, and brilliant Mara­ thon, and the wealthy cities under the lofty crest of Etna, and Euboea, all these shall bear witness to their victories.
And throughout all Greece thou wilt find by inquiring, moreh than thou canst see at first sight.0 sovereign Zeus, that granteth success in victories, grant them to swim forth from the troubles of life with light feet:
grant them modesty,i and the sweet good-fortune of honours.

PYTHIAN games (Πύθια), one of the four great national festivals of the Greeks.
It was celebrated in the neighbour­ hood of Delphi, anciently called Pytho, in honour of Apollo, Artemis, and Leto.
The place of this solemnity was the Crisscean plain, which for this purpose contained a hippo­ dromus, or race-course, a stadium of 1,000 feet in length.
and a theatre in which the musical contests took place A gymnasium, prytaneum, and other buildings of this kind, probably existed here, as at Olympia, although they are not mentioned.
Once the Pythian games were held at Athens on the advice of Demetrius Poliorcetes, because Ætolians were in possession of the passes around Delphi.
The Pythian games were, according to most legends, insti­ tuted by Apollo himself;
other traditions referred them to the ancient heroes, such as Amphictyon, Adrastus, Diomedes, and others.
They were originally, perhaps, nothing more than a religious panegyris, occasioned by the oracle of Delphi;
and the sacred games are said to have been at first only a musical contest, which consisted in singing a hymn in honour of the Pythian god, with the accompaniment of the cithara.
Some of the poets, however, and mythographers represent even the gods and the early heroes as engaged in gymnastic and equestrian contests at the Pythian games.
But such statements, numerous as they are, can prove no­ thing :
they are anachronisms, in which late writers were fond of indulging.
The description of the Pythian games in which Sophocles, in the Electra, makes Orestes take part, belongs to this class.
The Pythian games must, on account of the celebrity of the Delphic oracle, have become a national festival for all the Greeks at a very early period;
and when Solon fixed pecuniary rewards for those Athenians who were victims in the great national festivals, the Pythian agon was undoubtedly included in the number, though it is not expressly mentioned.
Whether gymnastic contests had been performed at the Pythian games previous to 01.
47, is uncertain.
Böckh supposes that these two kinds of games had been connected at the Pythia from early times, but that after­ wards the gymnastic games were neglected :
but, however this may be, it is certain that about Olympiad 47 they did not exist at Delphi Down to Olympiad 48 the Delphians themselves had been the agonothetæ at the Pythian games;
but in the third year of this Olympiad, when, after the Crissœan war, the A mphictyons took the management under their care, they naturally became the agonothetæ.
Some of the ancients date the institution of the Pythian games from this time, and others say that henceforth they were called Pythian games.
Owing to their being under the management of Amphictyons, they are sometimes called ’Αμφικτυονικὰ ἆθλα.
From Olympiad 48, 3, the Pythiads were occasionally used as an era, and the first celebration under the Amphictyons was the first Pythiad.
Pausanias expressly states that in this year the original musical contest in Κιθαρωδία was ex­ tended by the addition of αὐλω̨ ;
i. e. singing with the accompaniment of the flute, and by that of flute-playing alone.
Strabo, in speaking of these innovations, does not mention the αὐλω̨δία, but states that the contest of cithara- players (κιθαρισταί) was added;
while Pausanias assigns the introduction of this contest to the eighth Pythiad.
One of the musical contests at the Pythian games in which only flute and cithara-players took part, was the so-called νόμος πυθικός ;
which, at least in subsequent times, con­ sisted of five parts ;
viz., ἀνάκρουσις, ἄμπειρα, κατακελευσμὸς, ἲαμβοι καὶ δάκτυλοι, and σύο̡ιγγες.
The whole of this νόμος was a musical description of the fight of Apollo with the dragon, and of his victory over the monster.
A somewhat different account of the parts of this νόμος is given by the scholiast on Pindar, and by Pollux.
Besides these innovations in the musical contests which were made in the first Pythiad, such gymnastic and eques­ trian games as were then customary at Olympia, were either revived at Delphi, or introduced for the first time.
The chariot-race with four horses was not introduced till the second Pythiad.
Some games on the other hand wero adopted, which had not yet been practised at Olympia;
viz., the δολιχός, and the δίαυλος, for boys.
In the first Pythiad the victors received χρήματα as their prize, but in the second a chaplet was established as the reward for the victors.
The scholiasts on Pindar reckon the first Pythiad from this introduction of the chaplet, and their system has been followed by most modern chronologerg, though Pausanias expressly assigns this institution to the second Pythiad.
The αὐλω̨δία, which was introduced in the first Pythiad, was omitted at the second, and ever after, as only elegies and θρη̃νοι had been sung to the flute, which were thought too melancholy for this solemnity.
The τεθρίππος, or chariot-race with four horses, however, was added in the same Pythiad.
In the eighth Pythiad (Olym­ piad 55, 3) the contest in playing the cithara without singing was introduced;
in Pythiad 23, the foot-race in arms was added ;
in Pythiad 48, the chariot-race with two full-grown horses (συνώριδος δρόμος) was performed for the first time;
in Pythiad 53, the chariot-race with four foals was intro­ duced ;
in Pythiad 61, the pancratium for boys :
in Pythiad 53, the horse-race with foals;
and in Pythiad 69, the chariot- race with two foals was introduced.
Various musical con tests were also added in the course of time ;
and contests in tragedy, as well as in other kinds of poetry, and in recitations of historical compositions, are expressly mentioned.
Works of art, as paintings and sculptures, were exhibited to the assembled Greeks, and prizes were awarded to those who had produced the finest works.
The musical and artistic contests were at all times the most prominent feature of the Pythian games, and in this respect they even excelled the Olympic games.
Previous to Olympiad 48, the Pythian games had been an ἐνναετηρίς ;
that is, they had been celebrated at the end of every eighth year;
but in Olympiad 48, 3, they became, like the Olympia, a πενταετηρίς ;
i. e., they were held at the end of every fourth year ;
and a Pythiad, therefore, ever since the time that it was used as an era, comprehended a space of four years, commencing with the third year of every Olympiad.
Others have, in opposition to direct statements, inferred from Thucydides that the Pythian games were held towards the end of the second year of every Olympiad.
As for the season of the Pythian games, they were in all probability held in the spring, and most writers believe that it was held in the month of Bysius, which is supposed to be the same as the Attic Munychion.
Böckh, however, has shown that the games took place in the month of Bucatius, which followed after the month of Bysius, and that this month must be considered the same as the Attic Muny­ chion.
The games lasted for several days, as is expressly mentioned by Sophocles, but we do not know how many
Then ancient writers speak of the day of the Pythian gon, they are probably thinking of the musical agon alone, which was the .'ost important part of the games, and pro­ bably took place on the 7th of Bucatius.
It is quite impos- Bible to conceive that all the numerous games should have taken place on one day.
The concourse of strangers at the season of this panegyris must have been very great, as undoubtedly all the Greeks were allowed to attend.
The states belonging to the Am­ phictyony of Delphi had to send their theori in the month of Bysius, some time before the commencement of the festival itself.
All theori sent by the Greeks to Delphi, on this occasion, were called Πυθαἲσταί, and the theories sent by the Athenians were all particularly brilliant.
As regards sacrifices, processions, and other solemnities, it may be pre­ sumed that they resembled, in a great measure, those of Olympia.
A splendid, though probably in some degree fictitious, description of a theoria of Thessalians may be read in Heliodorus.
As to the order in which the various games were per­ formed, scarcely anything is known, with the exception of some allusions in Pindar, and a few remarks in Plutarch.
The latter says, that the musical contests preceded the gymnastic contests ;
and from Sophocles, it is clear that gymnastic contests preceded the horse and chariot-races.
Every game, moreover, which was performed by men and boys, was always first performed by the latter.
We have stated above, that down to Olympiad 48, the Delphians had the management of the Pythian games;
but of the manner in which they were conducted previous to that time nothing is known.
When they came under 1 he care of the Amphictyons, especial persons were appointed for the purpose of conducting the games, and of acting as judges
They were called ’Επιμεληταί, and answered to the Olympian Hellanodicæ.
Their number is unknown.
In later times it was decreed by the Amphictyons, that king Philip, with the Thessalians and Bœotians, should undertake the management of the games;
but afterwards, and even under tLe Roman emperors, the Amphictyons again appeared in the possession of this privilege.
The ίατηλεμιπἐ had to maintain peace and order, and were assisted by μαστιγοφόροι, who executed any punishment at their command, and thus answered to the Olympian ἀλυταί.
The prize given to the victors in the Pythian games was, from the time of the second Pythiad, a laurel chaplet;
so that they then became an ἀγὼν στεφανίτης, while before they had been ἀγὼν χο̡η­ ματίτης.
In addition to this chaplet, the victor here, as at Olympia, received the symbolic palm-branch, and was allowed to have his own statue erected in the Crissæan plain.
The time when the Pythian games ceased to be solemnized is not certain;
but they probably lasted as long as the Olympic games, i. e. down to the year A.D. 394.
In A.D. 191, a celebration of the Pythia is mentioned by Philostratus;
and in the time of the emperor Julian, they still continued to be held, as is manifest from his own words.
Pythian games of less importance were celebrated in a great many other places, where the worship of Apollo was introduced;
and the games of Delphi are sometimes distinguished from these lesser Pythia by the addition of the words iv Δελφοĩς.
But, as by far the greater number of the lesser Pythia are not mentioned in the extant ancient writers, and are only known from coins or inscriptions, we shall only give a list of the places where they were held:
—Ancyra in Galatia, Aphrodisias in Caria, Antiochia, Carthæ in the island of Ceos, Carthage, Cibyra in Phrygia, Delos, Emisa in Syria, Hierapolis in Phrygia, Magnesia, Megara, Miletus, Neapolis in Italy, Nicai in Bithynia, Nicomedia, Pergamus in Mysia, Perge in Pamphylia, Perinthus on the Propontis, Philippo­ lis in Thrace, Side in Pamphylia, Sicyon, Taba in Caria, Thessalonice in Macedonia, in Thrace, Thyatira, and Tr 1) in Lydia, Tripolis on the Mæander in Caria.

O GOLDEN LYRE, possession by a common right of Apollo and the violet-locked a Muses, which the dancer's step obeys, the beginning of the festive triumph, and whose signals the singers attend to, when, being made to thrill, thou givest forth the preludes of songs that lead the chorus.
Thou quenchest even the pointed thunderbolt of ever-flowing fire:
and on the sceptre of Zeus sleeps the eagle, having on either side dropped his swift wing, the king of birds;
and a black cloud over his beaked head, a cloud the sweet bar of his eyelids, thou hast shed;
and he, slumbering, heaves his un­ dulating back, overpowered by thy vibrations.
b
For even violent Ares, having left behind the hard point of spears, soothes his heart with a trance, and thy weapons wound the minds even of the gods by c the art of Apollo and the deep- zoned Muses.
But as many as Zeus does not love, hearing the sound of the Pierides, are bewildered, d throughout the earth, and the indomitable sea;
and he who lietb in dread Tartarus, the foe of the gods, Typho the hundred-headed, whom formerly the far-famed Cilician cave reared;
now, however, the sea-girt steeps above Cyme and Sicily press upon his shaggy breast, and the pillare of heaven confines him, snowy Ætna, nurse of sharp snow through all the year - Ætna, from whose recesses purest fountains of unapproachable fire belch forth, and her rivers during the daytime, indeed, pour forth a lurid stream of smoke, but in the gloom of night a ruddy flame, rolling forth rocks, bears them to the deep plain of the ocean, with a crash.
But that monster sends forth most dread torrents of fire;
a prodigy wonderful to gaze at, and a marvel to hear from those who pass by, in what wayf he is bound by the dark-leaved heights of Ætna and by its base,?
and the bed, h cutting furrows in it, grides his whole back, as it lies on the ground.
May it be mine, 0 Zeus, may it be mine to please thee, who rulest this mountain, forehead of a fruitful land, whose neigh­ bouring city, named after it,i its illustrious founder has ren­ dered glorious, and in the race-course of the Pythian festival the herald announcing it, proclaimed it in behalf of j Hiero, victorious in the chariot-race.
To seafaring men the first and chief blessing is, when they begin their voyage, that a favourable breeze should come to them for their voyage;
for it is likelyk that even a more favourable end of return may befall them ;
and what I have just said1 induces a belief, that after these so fortunate events it- will hereafter be renowned for crowns and horses, and of great name amidst sweet-sounding n banquets.
O Lycian Phœbus, king of Delos too, who lovest the Cas­ talian fountain of Parnassus, mayst thou be pleased to lay up these prayers of mine in thy mind, and to love the land that abounds with heroes.
o For from the gods all means of accomplishing their attempts are given to human virtues, and from them alone and by their favour men are born wise and puissant in hand and eloquent.
And I, bent on praising that hero, trust not to cast the brazen-pointed javelin beyond the mark as it were, bran­ dishing it in my hand, but having hurled it far,P to surpass my rivals.
For may all future time thus direct to him bliss, and the gift of riches, and afford him orgetfulness of his woes.
Of a truth it will remind him of what battles he has in war sustained with enduring soul, when they found empire and honour at the hands of the gods, such as none of the Greeks culls, the lordly crown of wealth.
Now in truth fol­ lowing the example of Philoctetes, he has gone to the war;
and through necessity a certain one, though haughty-spirited, has fawned upon him that he might be his friend;
and in like manner they say, that godlike heroes came to bear away from Lemnos the archer son of Pœas, afflicted with the ulcer :
him who destroyed the city of Priam, and put an end to the toils of the Danai, treading with enfeebled frame, but so it was willed by the fates.
Just so may the God prosper Hiero for the coming time, granting him success in the attainment of his wishes !0 Muse, obey me, that thou mayst sing near Dinomenes q the reward r of the four-horsed car ;

Grant, I beseech thee, Son of Cronus, that the Phoenician w and the army x of the Tyrsenians, since they have seen the lamentable disgrace of their ships that befell them before Syme, may remain in a peaceful home:
such sufferings they endured, overpowered by the leader of the Syracusans, who, from their swift-sailing galleys cast their youth into the sea, freeing Greece from bitter slavery.
I will raise from Salamis the glory of the Athenians, which is their due, y and in Sparta I shall celebrate the fight at Cithæron, in which the Medes armed with the crooked bow, were worsted;

If thou shalt have spoken a seasonably, bringing the issues of many events together, b less blame from men follows ;
for weary loathing blunts the eager zeal of the hearers, and fame spoken amongst the citizens most of all secretly afflicts the minds of the envious at the good that is seen in others.
But nevertheless, since envy is better than pity, omit not noble deeds.
c
Govern thy people with just helm and forged thy tongue on an anvil, free from falsehood ;
for if even anything trivial falls by chance from thee, it is esteemed as weighty, since it proceeds from thee.
Thou art the dispenser of many things :
there are many witnesses to both truth and false­ hood.
eBut, abiding in thy goodly temper, if at all thou lovest always to hear sweet report, f grow not over-tired in expense;
but, like a helmsman, let out the wind-filled sail of liberality:

The affable and hospitable worth of Crœsus fades not away, bUt hostile fame everywhere covers Phalaris, the burner in the brazen bull, him of pitiless heart;

MIGHTY CITY of Syracuse, sacred field of Ares deeply plunged in war, divine nurse of heroes and mail-clad steeds, a I am come bringing to you from splendid Thebes this strain, the tidings of the earth-shaking four-horse car, in which Hiero victorious-in-the-chariot-race being successful, has encircled Ortygia with crowns that shine afar, seat of fluvial Artemis, not without whose aid he subdued under his gentle hands those colts with broidered reins.
For the maiden de­ lighting in arrows, with both hands,b and Hermes who pre­ sideth over contests, place on them the brilliant adornment, c when hed yokes to the polished seat, and to the other parts of the car obedient to the reins, the strength of horses, invoking the wielder of the trident, the widely mighty god.
To other monarchy have other men e paid the tuneful hymn, the recompense of their worth.
Often, indeed, in mention of Cinyras, the praises of the Cyprians resound, Cinyras, whom Apollo of the golden hair kindly loved, the cherished priest of Aphrodite ;
for kindly-revering gratitude, with intention to requite good deeds, leads them on;
and thee, 0 son of Deinomenes, the Zephyrian Locrian maiden sings before her door, by means of thy power looking around with security, safe from the remediless woes of war.
And they say that Ixion, by the commands of the gods ever whirled round on the winged wheel, thus speaksf to mortals, " that they should requite their benefactor, ap­ proaching him g with benevolent returns and heh has clearly learnt this lesson ;
for with the friendly sons of Cronus having obtained a sweet life, he was not able to bear the huge bliss, when with maddened heart he was enamoured of Here, whom the delightful couch of Zeus has obtained ;
but insolence impelled him to the overweening crime, and soon did the man in suffering the just deserts of his crime, receive especial woe.
Now, too, these two offences are the cause of toil to him in the realms below:
in the first place, because he, the first demigod, brought upon mortals, and that not without cunning, kindred blood, and next, too, because that once in the spacious chambers of heaven, he attempted the spouse of Zeus.
It is right that, according to his own condition, a man should always keep in view the bounds of everything.
i But a lawless union in time past hurled him to great misery, and not unwilling too;
since he lay with a cloud, pursuing as he did a sweet fraud, he, unknowing man !
for in form it resembled the most eminent of the goddesses of heaven, the daughter of Cronus, which the arts of Zeus placed as a snare for him, a beauteous ruin.
And he wrought j for himself the four-spoked bond, his own destruction ;
and having been thrown into inevitable fetters, he took upon himself the message destined for all.

and from them sprung a wondrous brood, like to both their parents, from their dam inheriting the parts below, and the parts above from their sire
The deity accomplishes every end according to his wish— the deity, that overtakes even the winged eagle and outstrips the ocean dolphin, and overthrows one o amongst haughty mortals, and to others grants unfading glory.
But me it behoves to avoid p the violent sting of calumnies;
for I have seen, though far removed, q the railer Archilochus for the most part in great penury, from battening on slan­ derous enmities;
but to grow rich, by the aid of a happy fortune, is the best wisdom.r
But thou manifestly possesse t it,, so as to display it with liberal mind, thou prince, lord of many fair-crowned streets,t and of a numerous host.
But if any one now says that any other throughout Hellas of the men of former time was superior to thee in wealth and in honour, with silly mind he struggles to no purpose.
But singing loudly of thy valour, I will embark on board the fleet crowned with flowers :
u to youth valour in dreadful wars is an ally;
v whence I affirm that thou also hast found that boundless glory of thine, at one time contending amongst the men that urge on the steed, and at another in battles of the infantry;
and thy wisdom in counsel in more advanced years affords me safe ground to praise thee with regard to every matter.

c but Rhadamanthus has prospered, d because he has obtained the fruit of the mind, which none can blame ;

An insuperable evil to both are the secret tales of slander, altogether like the crafty disposi­ tions of foxes;
but what so great gain arises in this to the wily one ?

For, as while the rest of the net is plying the marine toil deep in the sea, I remain unwetted by the brine, like the cork above the net.h
And among the upright it is impossible that the crafty citizen should utter an influential word :
nevertheless, fawning upon all, he in every manner tries every twist.

I partake not of his impudence.
May it be mine to love my friend!
but against an enemy I will, as an enemy, make a secret attack like a wolf, going now this way and now that, in crooked course.
For j every form of government the straightforward-speak­ ing man excels, both in a monarchy, and when the turbulent people, and when the intelligentk guard the state.
But one ought not to contend against the deity, who at one time exalts the fortune of these, at another time again gives great glory to others but not even does this l soothe the mind of the envious ;
but, dragging at too great a line, m they inflict a great wound on their own heart before they obtain all that they devise in their thought.

Advice and moral reflections addressed to Hiero.
I COULD wish that Chiron the son of Phillyra, if it were permitted for me too as well as others openly a to utter this common vow, were alive, Chiron I say the deceased, the widely-ruling offspring of Cronus, son of Uranus, and that the wild centaur ruled in the glens of Pelion, having a mind friendly to mortals ;
being such still, as he was when formerly he bred Asclepius, the gentle artificer of freedom-from-pain.
that strengthens the limbs,b the demigod that wards off all kinds of diseases.
Now, before that the daughter of the equestrian Phlegyas had given birth to him, with the aid of Eleithya, the mother- tending, she, c after having been vanquished by the golden arrows of Artemis in her chamber, descended to the dwelling of Hades by the arts of Apollo.
For the wrath of the sons of Zeus never turns out to be in vain.
For she making no account of it, in the error of her mind accepted other nup­ tials, without the knowledge of her father, having before had intercourse with Phœbus of the unshorn hair, and bearing the divine seed of the god.
Nor was she wont to endure the coming of the nuptial board, nor the joyful shout of the loud-sounding wedding songs, d in such manner as her com­ panion maidens equals-in-years are wont toe soothe the bride with evening serenades ;
but of a truth she was enamoured of the absent, as many have ere now been affected.
For there is among men a most foolish race, who disdaining things of their own land,!
look round for what is remote, pursuing idle visions with fruitless hopes.
The bold fair-robed Coronis g incurred such mighty ruin :
for she slept in the couch of a stranger who came from Arcadia;
nor did she escape the notice of the ever-watching one j for happening to be at the victim-receiving Pytho, Loxias, lord of the temple, perceived the matter in his most direct informant, his mind that knoweth all things ;
he, I say, having persuaded his understanding;
h for he lays not hold of i falsehoods, and neither god nor mortal deceives him by deeds or thoughts.
And then Phœbus, having perceived the foreign embrace and the lawless fraud of Ischys son of Elatus, sent his sister, storming with irresistible rage, to Laceria ;
since the maiden dwelt at the precipices of the Bœbian lake :
and a hostile dæmon k having allured her to evil, subdued her ;
and many of the neighbours hence received destruction, l and perished along with her;
and the fire which leapt from one spark consumed much wood on the mountain.m
But when her relatives placed the maiden on the mound of wood, and the furious blaze of Hephæstus surrounded her, then Apollo spoke :
“ I will endure no further in my soul to destroy n my offspring in a most piteous death, involved in the grievous calamity of his mother."
Thus he spoke, and at the first stop having reached the boy, he snatched him from the corpse, and the blazing pyre clave asundero for him ;
and then he bore and gave him to the Magnesian Centaur, to teach him how to cure manifold diseases for mortals.
Those, therefore, as many as came afflicted with self-caused ulcers, or wounded as to their limbs, either with gleaming brass or by the far-hurled stone, or wasted as to their frame by the sum­ mer's fire or winter's cold, freeing different persons from different pains, he rescued them;
tending some with gentle charms, and others by drinking soothing potions, or binding on all sides round their limbs plasters made from herbs, and others by amputation he raised erect from sickness ;
but even wisdom has been bound by desire of gain, and gold shining in the hand, by a magnificent reward induced even him to restore from death a man already seized by it:
and then Zeus, hurling with his hands a bolt through both, speedily took away the breath of their breasts, and the flash­ ing bolt inflicted death.
We ought to implore with human thoughtsp what is suitable from the deities, having come to know what is near at hand,q of what a destinyr we are.
Strive not, 0 my soul, at immortal life, but use to the atmost the means within thy power.
But if the discreet Chiron still inhabited his cave, and if in any respect my melodious hymns could have put a spell upon his mind, I would in truth have persuaded him even now to furnish to good men a healer of feverish diseases, either some son of Apollo or of his sire ;
and I would have gone in ships cleaving the Ionian Sea to the fountain Arethusa, to my Ætnean host, who bears sway at Syracuse, gentle to his subjects, entertaining no insidious feeling towards good citizens, and a marvellous fatherS to strangers.
For whom, if I had reached the land, bringing two delights, golden health and festal procession, bright glory to the wreaths of the Pythian victories, which Pherenicus, best in the race, formerly won in Cirrha, I assert that, as a light more far- shining than a star of heaven, I should have come to him, after that I had crossed the deep sea.
But I am desirous to address my prayer to the mother of the gods, the revered goddess, whom, along with Pan, the maidens by my porch often celebrate in song by night.
But if, 0 Hiero, thou understandest how to read aright the recondite sense of legendary tales, thou knowest, being instructed by those of old,t that, for one blessing, the immor­ tals distribute two evils together for mortals.
These more numerous evils, however, the foolish are not able to endure becomingly, but the good do so endure them, having turned their bright side out to view.
But the lot of happiness accompanies thee.
For mighty Fate regards with favour a sovereign leader of the people, if it does any man.
But a life without trip or stumble happened neither to Peleus, son of Æacus, nor to the godlike Cadmus, who verily are said to have possessed the highest bliss of mortals, seeing that they heard the Muses with the golden frontlet carolling, on the mountain and in seven-gated Thebes, when the one wedded full-eyed Harmonia, and the other Thetis, the far-famed daughter of wise Nereus.
And the gods feasted with both, and they beheld the kingly sons of Cronus on thrones of gold, and received nuptial gifts ;
and through the favour of Zeus having escaped from former evils, they raised their heart erect.
But afterwards, however, the one,u did his three daughters, by their sharp afflictions, deprive of a portion of his happiness ;
but father Zeus came to the coveted couch of the white-armed Thyone.
But the son of the other,v whom being an only child the immortal Thetis brought forth in Pthia, he, I say having lost his life in war by the bow, called forth, when burnt with the funereal fire, wailing from the Greeks.
But if any one of mortals holdeth in his mind the way of truth,w he ought, for that he has obtained them from the gods, to enjoy the blessings he has ;
but at various times various blasts of the soaring winds prevail;
for the bliss of man goes not far,x when being of exceeding greatness it descends with all its weight.
Moderate shall I be in moderate for­ tune, great in great :
I will always honour in my heart the fortune that attends me, suiting my temper to ity according to my utmost ability.
But if the deity should extend to me sumptuousz wealth, I have hope that I may find lofty glory in future.

263—299 :
Good advice to Arcesilaus, and entreaty that Demophilus may be recalled by him from banishment.
TO-DAY, 0 Muse, thou must take thy station near a hero who is my friend, the king of Cyrene nurse of steeds, that with Arcesilaus, as he advances in triumph, thou mayest swell a the prosperous gale of hymns due to the children of Latona and to Pytho,—
Where of yore the priestess, who sits near the golden eagles of Zeus, Apollo not being absent from his shrine, oracularly pronounced Battus the founder of fruitful Libya;
' how that forthwith having left the holy island (Thera), he should found a city famed for cars on a chalky hill, and that with the seventeenth generation he should bring to pass again the prophetic word of Medea, addressed to Theras, which formerly the fieryb child of Æetes breathed forth from her immortal mouth, queen as she was of the Colchians.
And thus she spoke to the demi-god sailors of Jason the warrior:
“ Hear, 0 children of daring heroes and of gods!
for I declare, that from this sea-beaten earth the daughter of Epaphusc shall some day plant a root of cities,d object of love to men, in the place where Zeus Ammone stands.
And taking in exchange swift steeds for short-finned dolphins and reins for oars,f they shall ply the storm-footed steeds.
For that augury g shall at last bring about that Thera be the mother-city of mighty cities ;
that augury, I say, which late at the mouth of the Tritonian lake, at the hands of a god in the form of a man giving earth in token of hospitality, Euphemus, having descended from the prow, received :
and, auspicious for him, Father Zeus son of Cronus made the thunder roar;
as upon the ship they were hanging the anchor with tooth of brass, the curb of the swift Argo.
For twelve days before, out of Ocean, we bore over the desert ridges of earth the bark, having drawn it up on shore by my advice.
Then the deity, lone-roving, came upon us, having assumed the bright appearance of an august man;
and he commenceth friendly words, as the hospitable first offer refreshment to guests on their arrival;
but we would not avail ourselves of his hospitality, for the cause of a sweet return hindered us from remaining :
and he said that he was Eurypylus, son of the immortal Earth- shaker,h and he knew that we were hastening;
therefore, immediately snatching the sod of earth which was nearest him, he shove to offer it as a gift of hospitality.
Nor did lie!, refuse compliance to him, but the hero having leaped upon the shore and having stretched his hand to the hand of the god, received the heaven-sent clod.
But I hear that it fell overboardi from the sea-washed ship, and was carried away by the brine at evening, driven onward by the moist ocean.
Of a surety often did I urge the labour-lightening attendants to guard it;
but their minds forgot.
And now in this island is shed the imperishable seed of spacious Libya before the appointed time.j
For if Euphemus had, at his home, cast it near the mouth of subterranean Hades, Euphemus, I say, having arrived at sacred Tænarus, he, the royal son of Poseidon ruler of the steed, whom formerly Europa, daughter of Tityus, bore by the banks of Cephisus, had he done so, I say, then Iris blood in the fourth offspring would, along with the Danai, have taken that wide continent.
For then they shall set out from mighty Lacedæmon, and from the Argive gulf, and from Mycenæ.
But now, indeed,k he shall find in the bed of foreign women a chosen seed, which with the favour of the gods having come to this island, shall be parents to a hero, lord of the black-soiled plains;
whom, at some future time, in his gold-adorned temple, Phoebus shall warn with oracles when he has entered the Pythian shrine, that in after time he is to conduct in ships many men to the rich precinct of Zeus Nilus.”
lOf a surety such was the order of Medea's words.m
And motionless, in dumb amazement, did the godlike heroes cower down, hearing the sage counsel.0 blest son of Polymnestus, thee, agreeably to this pre­ diction, the oracle hath ennobled by the spontaneous voice of the Delphic bee ;
n which having three times bid thee hail, proclaimed thee destined king of Cyrene, when thou wast inquiring what help for impeded speech there shall be from the gods.
But now many years after,o Arcesilaus, the eighth porti onp to this progeny, flourishes as in the bloom of roseats sprii.g;
Arcesilaus, I say, to whom Apollo and Pytho have granted glory from the race-course of the neighbouring states.
Him and the all-golden fleece of the ram will I give to the Muses to celebrate;
for the Minyæ having sailed after that fleece, divine honours were won by them.
What commencement of the voyage awaited them ?
q
What peril held them bound with strong rivets of adamant ?
It was fated that Pelias should die by the hands, or by the unflinchingr plots of the high-born sons of Æolus.
And the prediction fell chill upon his wise soul, uttered near the mid-navel of mother earth, clothed with fair woods;
"to stand by all means greatly on his guard against the one­ sandalled man, when, from a lofty abode, he should come to the sunny land of the far-famed Iolcos, a stranger, or being a citizen."
And he, as you might expect, in time came with two javelins, a wondrous hero ;
and a garment of both kinds clothed him ;
both the garment, that is to say, used in the country of the Magnesians, fitting closely to his wondrous limbs, and, on the other hand, he kept off, with a panther's skin thrown round him, shivering rains ;
nor were the shining tresses of his locks shorn and gone, but they floated down his whole back.
Then, forthwith, advancing straight on­ ward, he stood, putting to the proof his undaunted soul, in the market-place, where the multitude thronged.
But him they knew not:
yet, some one from among the reverently-gazing crowd said this amongst other things:
“ Surely, methinks, this is not Apollo, nor, moreover, is it Aphrodite's paramour with bis brazen car, and they say that in bright Naxos the chil­ dren of Iphimedia died, Otus and thou, 0 daring monarch Ephialtes.
And, moreover, the swift-winged dart of Artemis caught Tityus, the dart, I say, rushing forth from her un­ conquered quiver, that one might learn to seek for lawful loves.
"They, indeed, in answer to each other, spoke in such fashion :
and borne by mules and a polished car, with head­ long haste Pelias came hurrying;
and forthwith he was amazed, beholding the readily-recognized sandal solitary around his right foot.
But disguising his fear in his mind, be addressed him :
"
What land, 0 stranger, dost thou boast to be thy country?
And who of earth-born women sent thee forth from her aged womb ?
Declare thy race, polluting it not with most odious falsehoods."
And him boldly with gentle words thus he answered:
“ I say that I bear with me the instruction of Chiron;
for I come from his cave from Chariclo and Philyra, where the pure daughters of the centaur reared me.
And having accomplished twenty years, and having done neither any dishonest action, nor spoken any deceitful word to them, I have come to my home, endeavouring to recover the ancient kingdom of my father, which is now unjustly swayed by another, the kingdom which Zeus formerly granted to the chieftain Æolus and to his children.
For I hear that Pelias unjustly, having obeyed his envioust soul, violently seized it from my parents, its lawful owners;
who, as soon as ever I saw the light, fearing the violence of the overbearing ruler, having instituted mournful wailing in the palace for me, as having died, amidst the wailings of women, sent me secretly in purple swaddling-clothes intrusting their journey to the secrecy ot night,u and gave me to Chiron, son of Cronus, to rear.
But of these matters know this to be the sum.
Now the dwellings of my noblev sires, 0 discreet citizens, declare to me clearly ;
for being the son of Æson and a native, I should not I fancy come to a foreign land of aliens.
Now the divine centaur addressed me by the name of Jason."
Thus he spoke;
him, indeed, as he entered, the eyes of his father recognized, and from his aged eyelids gushed forth tears, since he rejoiced in his soul, beholding his distinguished offspring fairest of men.
And to greet them, both the brothers of Æson came at the report of his arrival;
first at hand, Pheres, having left the fountain Hyperæa, and from Messene came Amythaon :
and quickly came Admetus and Melampus, saluting in friendly fashion their cousin.
And in the fellowship of the feast, Jason, receiving them with mild words, preparing a suitable banquet, prolonged all festivity culling for five continuous days and nights the sacred flower- of enjoy­ ment.
But on the sixth laying before them the whole grave matter, the hero recounted it from the very beginning to his relatives;
and they approved;
and forthwith from the banquet he sprung with them.
And then they came to the palace of Pelias;
and rushing on they took their stand within.
And hearing them, he himself, the offspring of Tyro decked with love-locks, met them;
but Jason, with mild voice, distilling x gentle discourse, laid the foundation of wise words :
—"
Son of Petræan Poseidon, y the minds of mortals are too swift to approve of crafty gain before justice, though they come nevertheless to a hard reckoning:
but thee and me it behoveth, ruling our tempers, to weave happiness for the future.
I speak in truth to one who knows :
one and the same dam was mother to Cretheus and Salmoneus bold in council;
and in the third generation we, in turn, begotten from them, behold the golden light of the sun.
But the Fates turn away in displeasure, if any enmity arises among relations, so as to cast into the shade their reverence for each other.
It becometh not us two with swords formed of brass, nor with javelins, to make partition of the mighty dominion of our forefathers;
for I give up to thee both flocks of sheep and tawny herds of cattle, and all the fields which, after taking them from my parents, thou grazest, increasing thy wealth;
nor does it grieve me that these greatly furnish thy house with store of riches.
But the sovereign sceptre and the throne, on which of yore the son of Cretheus sitting, administered justice aright to his eques­ trian subjects, these;
without causing trouble to us both, do thou release to us, lest some more grievous evil arise from them.
"Thus, then, he spoke:
and gently too did Pelias answer in return:
“
Such as thou suggestest will I be ;
but already the aged part of life encompasses me ;
but thy flower of youth is just swelling up ;
and thou hast ability to set aside the wrath of the gods of the nether world.
For Phrixus bids some, having gone t o the dwe ling-place of Æetes, to rescue z his soul and to bring the thick-fleeced hide of the ram, by which formerly he was saved from the ocean and from the ungodly darts of his stepmother.
These things doth a wondrous dream that came to me declare.
And I inquired of the oracle at Castalia, if aught was to.
be further searched after :
and the deity enjoins upon me to prepare the convoy home for Phrixus by a ship.
a
This toil do thou, nothing loth, accomplish :
and on such conditions, I swear that I will give up to thee the mo­ narchy and the kingly power :
may Zeus, the tutelar deity of the race of both of us, be the mighty witness of the oath !
"Having agreed to this compact, they indeed parted ;
but Jason himself now sent forth heralds to make known in every quarter the intended voyage.
And quickly came three sons unwearied in fight, of Zeus son of Cronus, and of Alcmena with rapid-glancing eyes, and of Leda ;
and two heroes with hair that waved high in air, b the race of the Earth-shaker, showing a sense of shame in their strength, c came from Pylos and from the headland of Tænarus :
whose high fame, and that of Euphemus was con­ summated in this expedition, and thine too, 0 widely-potent Periclymenus.
And, sent from Apollo, a harper, father of songs, came, renowned Orpheus.
And Hermes with wand of gold, sent his two sons to unabating toil, the one Echion, exulting were they in youthful strength,d and Eurytus, the other.
And quickly came on those who dwelt about the roots of Pangæus;
for not unwilling, with cheerful spirit, Boreas, king of winds, more quickly made readye Zetes and Calais, heroes both, with backs that bristled with purple feathers.f
And Here kindled the all-persuading, sweet desire for the ship Argo in the heroes, that no one, being left behind, should remain with his mother, leading a sodden life of ease g but that, even on condition of death, he should seek to find the fairest remedy for his valour, with the rest of his peers.
hBut when the flower of sailors was gone down to Iolcos, Jason, having praised all, numbered them.
And then the soothsayer Mopsus, divining with auguries from birds and sacred lots, with forward soul made the crew embark.
And when above the prow they hung the anchors, the leader having taken in his hands a golden drinking-bowl, standing on the stern, called upon i Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt as a lance, father of the sons of Uranus, and the swift-rushing blasts of the winds and the waves, and nights and ocean paths,j and auspicious days and wished-for destiny of return :
k from the clouds a favourable voice of thunder sounded in answer, and there came brilliant rays of lightning, shooting apart.l
The heroes took breath again, relying on the omens of the Deity, and the seer Mopsus, interpreting the augury, commanded them to ply the oars,m announcing sweet hopes ;
and rowing succeeded n from their swift hands, unwearied.
And, conducted on by the breezes of the south wind, they came to the mouth of the Axine sea :
there they founded a holy, sacred-precinct of Poseidon of the Ocean, and a tawny herd of Thracian bulls was there at hand,o and newly built of stones the hollow of an altar's plane.
And, being thrown into deep danger, they prayed the lord of ships that they might escape the irresistible movement of clashing rocks.
For there were twain endowed with life, and they whirled more rapidly than the array of bellowing winds ;
but now to them that voyage of the demigods brought the close of life.
PAnd thereafter they came to the Phasis;
there they fought with the swarthy Colchians, close by Æetes himself, q And the Cyprus-born goddess, mistress of keenest weapons, then first brought to men the mottled wryneck, tied on the four- spoked wheel, having brought it from Olympus, having bound on the indissoluble round the bird that inspires frantic passion;
and she taught the wise son of Æson words of incan­ tation and charms, in order that he might disarm Medea of compunction towards her parents, and that the longing for Greece might agitate her, while her heart was inflamed with love, with the scourge of desire.
And quickly she showed him the ways of bringing to a close the toils imposed by her sire :
and, mingling them with oil, she compounded antidotes against stubborn pains, and gave them to him, wherewith to anoint himself.
And they plighted their troth to join sweet mutual marriage with each other.
But when Æetes fixed down the adamantine plough in the midst of them, and placed the oxen, which breathed from their yellow jaws flame of blazing fire, and with their brazen hoofs, as they moved their feet alternately, broke the ground-these he alone,?
having brought up, fixed securely to the yoke.
And, draw­ ing out straight furrows, he drove the oxen, and he furrowed upr the back of the loamy soil a fathom's depth,s and thus he spoke :
—"
This work having accomplished for me, let the king, who­ ever he be that commandeth the vessel, bear off the imperish­ able coverlid of the couch, the fleece resplendent with golden wool."
When then he had thus spoken, Jason having cast off his saffron mantle, relying on the god, applied himself to the task ;
and the fire makes him not to waver, thanks to t the injunctions of his hostess skilled in every drug.
Drag­ ging forth the plough, and having bound the necks of the oxen with compulsory bonds,u and smiting their strong-ribbed body with the terrible goad, the forceful hero accomplished the appointed measure of his task :
and Æetes, though in speechless grief, groaned, marvelling at his might;
and to the strong hero his companions stretched forth loving hands, and covered him with garlands of herblets, and greeted him with kind words.
And forthwith the wondrous son of Helios pointed out v the brilliant hide, where the knives of Phrixus stretched it out;
but he hoped that he w would not accomplish for him that further toil, at any rate ;
for it by in a thicket, and it was held by the most furious jaws of a dragon, which in thickness and in length exceeds a ship with fifty oars, which blows of the hammer have perfected.
It is long for me to return on the beaten track ;
for time isx closing in;
and I know a certain short path, and am to many others a guide of art.
yHe slew indeed by his arts the azure-eyed serpent with back of varied hues, 0 Arcesilaus, and stole away, with her own assistance, Medea, her that caused the death of Pelias.
And they approached z to the open floods of Ocean, and to the Red Sea, and to the nation of Lemnian women that slew their husbands;
where too in combats they displayed proof of their limbs for the prize of a robe,a and lay with them.
And then in foreign lands the hours of day or night received the destined seed of the beam of thy happiness ;
b for then the race of Euphemus being planted, arose, always to remain and reaching the dwellings of Lacedæmonian men, in course of time they colonized the island once called Callista.
And thence did the son of Latona bring to pass for you to exalt, by the favour of the gods, the plain of Libya ;
to you, I say, having discovered right-counselling wisdom for governing the divine city of golden-throned Cyrene.
Study to gain the wisdom of Œdipus.c
For if one should,d with keen axe, hew off the branches of a mighty oak, and mar its wondrous form, still, though withered, it gives the means of judging of itself if haply at last it comes to the winter fire ;
or if acting as a support in conjunction with other straight pillars of the master's house,!
it undertakes a mean toil in alien walls, leaving its own place desolate.
Th ,u art the most opportune healer of the state, and Pœan faveurs thy good fortune.
Thou oughtest, therefore, applying a gentle hanu, to dress the wound of the ulcer , for to shake a city is easy even for the viler sort, but to put it back in its places is difficult indeed, unless the deity on a sudden direct the leaders in their course.
For thee a happy destiny in these respects is woven by the Fates;
wherefore boldly under­ take in behalf of favoured Cyrene to lay out all thy zeal.
Amongst other sayings of Homer, this saying too do thou hear and diligently observe :
" a well-advised messenger," he said, "brings most honour to every deed."
And the Muse is promoted to honour by a message rightly spoken.h
Cyrene and the most renowned hall of Battus hath by experience learnt the justice that dwells in the heart of Demophilus.
For he, young among youths, but in counsels old, as if he had experienced a life of a hundred years, deprives calumny of its far-sounding tongue, and has learnt to hate the insolent, not striving against the good, nor delaying the accomplish­ ment of any duty.
For opportunity hath but a brief limit among men.
He hath well understood it;
i and he attends on it as a faithful follower, not as a hireling.
jThey say that this is most grievous, when acquainted with what is best, to be compelled to be without it.
And yet he,k an Atlas, now at any rate struggles with Olympus,l far from his native land and from his possessions.
Yet immortal Zeus released the Titans;
and in time changes m of sails take place after the wind has ceased.n
But he prays, that having seen to its end his deadly disease,o he may some day see his home ;
and near Apollo's fountain,?
attending at the banquet, often give himself up to youthful cheer, and amongst the music- loving citizens bearing his cunningly wrought lyre, that he may enjoy q repose ;
and so neither do wrong to any, and him­ self suffer none from the citizens.
And in sooth he may tell what a fountain of ambrosial strains he found for Arcesilaus,r when lately entertained by me as a guest at Thebes.
Inscribed to the same Arcesilaus as the preceding ode, and on account of the same victory:
01. 78, 3. B.C. 466 :
sung at Cyrene, in the triumphal procession to the temple of Apollo.
The chariot in which the victory was won had been consecrated by the charioteer, Carrhotus, brother-in-law of Arcesilaus, at Delphi.1—10 :
The power of wealth combined with virtue.
11—53 :
The good fortune of Arcesilaus due to the gods and the skill of Carrhotus his charioteer.
53—97 :
Apollo prospers the family of Battus.
97—116:
Conclusion with the praises of Arcesilaus, for whom the poet offers his prayers.
WEALTH is widely potent, when any mortal man obtains ita at the gift of fortune ;
a greatly-prized companion, when conjoined with distinguished virtue.
O Arcesilaus, blessed by the gods, thou, from the first steps of an illustrious life, with glory pursuest after these b by the favour of Castor of the golden car, who, after a wintry storm, sheds a calm over thy happy house.
Of a truth the wise bear better even the power that the gods bestow ;
c but thee, as thou walkest in justice, abun­ dant prosperity encompasseth :
partly because thou art the monarch of mighty cities, the native light of thy genius hath this most majestic honour given in combination with thy wisdom ;
and partly thou art blessed in the present, too, because having already gained glory by thy steeds from the far-famed Pythian games, thou hast received this triumphal procession of heroes, the delight of Apollo.
Wherefore, forget not, when celebrated at Cyrene, roundc the sweet garden of Aphrodite, to set the Deity indeed over aught else, but love Carrhotus most of thy companions ;
d who, not bringing excuse, daughter of after-thought, late in learning wisdom, has come to the mansions of the justly- ruling sons of Battus ;
but received as a guest at the water of Castalia, he, with undamaged reins, has placed around thy locks the prize for being first in the chariot-race in the sacred spot e of twelve swift courses.
For he broke in no way the strength of the harness;
but there is suspended as a votive offering, all the workmanship of skilful artificers, which he brought with him to the hollow plain of the god, after he had passed the Crissæan hill;
wherefore the cypress chapel holds it close by the statue which the bow-bearing Cretans placed in the Parnassian hall ;
f the statue consisting of the trunk of one tree, formed by natural growth.
It behoveth thee, therefore, with willing spirit, to go to meet thy bene­ factor.
And thee, 0 Carrhotus, son of Alexibius, the fair- haired Charites render famous :
and blest art thou, who hast, although after great toil, a memorial of highest praise.
For amongst forty fallen charioteers, having with fearless mind brought off thy chariot whole and entire, thou hast now come from the famous contests to the plain of Libya, and to thy native city.
But no one is, or ever will be, without share of toils ;
and yet the ancient good fortune of Battus attends Arcesilaus, assigning a variety of blessings, being the city's tower, and most brilliant light of protection to strangers.
From him too did the loud-roaring lions fly through fear;
since he brought to them a voice unheard by them before, that came across the sea, and Apollo, leader of the colony, gave the beasts up to dread fear, in order that he might not fail to make his oracles good to the ruler of Cyrene :
Apollo who, too, of grievous diseases bestoweth on men and women reme­ dies, and hath granted also the harp, and imparts the muse unto whomsoever he may please, implanting into the heart love of order averse to war, and who guards the prophetic cave :
wherefore, g he made the valiant sons of Hercules and of Ægimius to inhabit in Lacedæmon and in Argos, and in divine Pylos.
Now they say that my glorious origin is from Sparta, sprung from which source there came to Thera the race of the Ægidæ, my ancestors, not without the interven­ tion of the gods ;
but some fate brought the festival of many victims ;
h whence,i 0 Apollo, wej having received the Carnea, celebrate in thy banquet the well-built city of Cyrene.
k Cyrene, which the Trojan strangers, sons of Antenor, re­ joicing in brazen arms, possess.
For they came with Helen, after that they had seen their country burnt to ashes by war :
and the men whom Aristoteles brought, heartily receive with sacrifices and approach with gifts that knightly race ,lAris­ toteles,m I say, opening out a deep path over the sea with swift ships.n
And he planted groves of the gods larger than he found there, and he laid down the straight-cut, level road, paved with stones, so that it could be trodden by the horses in the processions in honour of Apollo, that wards off diseases from mortals , the road, I say, from the place where he lies buried apart from other sepulchres, at the far end of the forum.
Blest indeed did he dwell among men, but after­ wards he has become a hero honoured by the people.
But apart, before the palaces, the other sacred0 kings have obtained their sepulchre, and they have been besprinkled with the refreshing dew of mighty glories,?
and with the streams of the revel-songs ;
q and they hear beneath the earth their own bliss, and the glory of victory common to them with their descendant Arcesilaus, to whom it justly belongs :
Arcesilaus, I say, whom in this song of the youths it becomes to celebrate Phœbus of the golden lyre,s since.
ne has gained from Pytho the sweet hymn which commemorates the victory he has won, and is a recompense of the expenses he has incurred in the contest:
the prudent praise that hero.
I say what is said by others :
t he cherishesu an under­ standing beyond his years, and in speaking and in boldness he is as the long-winged eagle among birds ;
v and his might of contest w is a bulwark to his subjects ;
and he soars aloft in the studies of the Muses,x even from his mother ;
y and he hath shown himself to be a skilful charioteer:
and all the avenues that there are to honour in his native land, these he has assayed.
And the Deity even now willingly bestows.
on him power;
and for the future henceforth, 0 blessed sons of Cronus, grant that he may have ita in deeds and in coun­ sels, lest the stormy autumnal blast of winds destroy the fruits of time.
b
Assuredly the mighty hand of Zeus steers aright the fortune of those whom he loves.
I pray that he may add this honourc in Olympia besides to the race of Battus.
Inscribed to Xenocrates of Agrigentum, victorious in the chariot-race :
01. 71, 3. B.C. 494 :
the ode is addressed to Thrasybulus, the soil of Xenocrates, who acted as charioteer for his father on the occasion.
1—18 :
Address.
A store of praise is laid up in the vale of Pytho fcr the conqueror and his family.
19—54:
Thrasybulus, the son of Xenocrates, is praised for his filial affection, and is compared to Antilochus, son of Nestor:
he resembles his father and his uncle in wisdom, moderation of spirit, love of the Muses, &c.LISTEN!
for we turn up the glebe either of quick-glancing Aphrodite or of the Charites," proceeding in poeticflight to the eternal centre of the loud-echoing earthy where, celebrating Pythian victory for the blest Emmenidæ, and for Agragas on the river, and especially for Xenocrates, a treasury of song, ready prepared, lies encircled by walls, in the golden glen of Apollo;
which treasury of song, neither shall the fiercely-driving wintry tempest,c that is, the relentless host of the loud-roaring cloud, nor shall the winds hurl to the recesses of the sea, violently up-dashing it with rubbish of every kind :
d but, with countenance in clear light of heaven,e this treasury of song shall announce in reports of men, the glorious victory with the car ton in the Crissæan winding vales, the glory of which is common to thy sire, 0 Thrasybu­ lus, and to thy race.
Thou, in truth, having obtained the victory by setting thy father in the place of honour,f rightly observest the precepts as to those points which g they say that formerly the son of Philyra on the mountains enjoined on the mighty son of Peleus, when parted from his parents;
namely, most especially among the gods, to hold in reverence the son of Cronus, the loud-sounding lord of lightnings and of thunder;
and of this honour h never to deprive the life of thy parents as long as the Fates may destine it to last.
And even formerly the mighty Antilochus bore within, this mind, Antilochus, who perished for his father, enduring the attack of the man-slaying captain of the Ethiopian host, Memnon;
for a steed impeded the chariot of Nestor, wounded by the arrows of Paris;
and hei was hurling his strong spear;
and the agitated soul of the Messenian old man called loudly on his son, nor in truth did he send forth a cry that came to nought, but the godlike man, withstanding the attack of Memnon, purchased by his own death the rescue of his father, and having performed a mighty deed, he was esteemed among the younger men of those of ancient days as first in affection towards parents.
kThese things indeed are gone by;
but of men of the present day Thrasybulus has walked most according to the rule of his father, and following his uncle's steps has shown forth the splendour of victory.
And wisely does he administer wealth, culling youth's flower without injustice and without pride, and cultivating wisdom in the secret haunts of the Pierides;
and to thee, O Earth-shaker, he devotes himself with very willing spirit, from natural disposition for entering into the lists of equestrian contests;
- and the sweetness of his disposition in associating with his guests, surpasses the perforated toil of bees.
nInscrbed to Megacles of Athens (one of the family of the Alcmæonidæ), victor in the chariot-race:
01. 72, 3. B.C. 490.
Praise of Athens, the Athenians, and the Alcmæonidæ, the family of the conqueror.
Envy is deprecated.
THE mighty city of Athens is the fairest prelude upon which to lay a basement of song in honour of the widely-powerful race of the Alemæonidæ for their steeds.
aSince what country, what inhabited home can I name in Greece more renowned in men's hearing ?b
For to all cities does the praise of the citizens of Erechtheus c come, who, 0 Apollo, built in divine Pytho thy wondrous temple.
And five victories at the Isthmus, and one distinguished victory sacred to Jove in Olympia, and two from Cirrha, impel me to sing, 0 Megacles;
victories, I say, gained by thee and thy ancestors.
At thy recent victory I rejoice not a little, but at that I am grieved, that envy repaysd illus­ trious actions.
Yet they say that even thus,e lasting and prosperous good fortune brings various events to men.
fInscribed to Aristomenes of Ægina, victor in the wrestling-match of boys:
the date of the ode is uncertain, according to Dissen and Boeckh, 01. 80, 3. B.C. 458 ;
according to Hermann and Donaldson, 01. 75, 3. B.C. 478, two years after the battle of Salamis, to which, and not to the battle of Cecryphalea, they consider the allusions in the beginning of the ode tc refer :
sung probably in Ægina, during the procession to the temple of Hesychia.
1—20:
Invocation of Hesychia (Peace or Tranquility).
21—60:
Praise of Aristomenes, to whom the poet applies the saying of Amphiaraus concerning his son Almæon, one of the Epigoni, and interweaves the prophecy of Amphiaraus concerning the taking of Thebes.
61—100 :
The various victories of Aristomenes are alluded to:
reflections on the uncertainty of human prosperity, and the shortness of life.
O KINDLY Hesychia,a daughter of Justice, thou that makest cities greatest, and hast of wars and of councils the supreme keys, receive from Aristomenes honour for the Pythian victory.
b
For thou knowest both how to give and receive pleasing gifts at the proper season ;
c but thou, when any one shall have driven into his heartd relentless wrath, roughly opposing the might of foes, castest their insolence into the sea.
Whome Porphyrion did not reflect that he was unduly provoking.
But that gain is the most agreeable, which one bears offf from the dwelling of a willing giver ;
but violence is wont at last to overthrow even the very boastful.
The Cilician hundred-headed Typho did not escape it,g nor even the king of the giants;
but they were subdued by the thunderbolt and the arrows of Apollo, who, in propitious mood has received Aristomenes, the son of Xenarces, arriving from Cirrha, crowned with the Parnassian leaf,h and the Dorian festal song.
And the island of Ægina, strict in public justice, is not estranged from the Graces, touchingi the renowned virtues ot the Æacidæ, but possesses perfect glory from the beginning.
For she is celebrated in song, in that she hath reared heroes highest in many victorious contests and nimble fights, and partly too j she is distinguished for population.
But I lack leisure to consecrate to the lyre, and to the sweet voice, the whole of the long discourse, lest satiety supervening should offend ;
but let that which is now present before us, thy affairk 0 youth, the most lately gained of the honours of Ægina, be accomplished1 speedily, furnished with wings by means of my art.
For in the wrestling-matches going after m thy maternal uncles, thou dost not disgrace either Theognetus, at Olympia, nor in the victory of Cleito­ machus gained-by-stoutness-of-limb at the Isthmus;
but.
exalting the race of the Midylidæ, thou earnest off that praise which formerly Amphiaraus, the son of Oileus, myste­ riously uttered, when he saw n the sons of the heroes at seven- gated Thebes, bravely standing out the battle, what time from Argos came on the second expedition, the Epigoni.
Thus he spoke, while they were fighting :
—"
By nature, the high-born courage descended from their sires is conspicuous in sons.
Clearly do I behold Alcmæon, wielding foremost at the gates of Cadmus a many-coloured dragon on a fiery o shield.
But he that suffered in the former disaster, he, the hero Adrastus, is now held by the announcement p of a more favourable omen ;
but as to domestic matters, he shall fare the reverse of this ;
for he alone of the host of the Danai, having gathered together the bones of his deceased son, shall by the favour of the gods arrive with his army uninjured to the spacious streets of Abas."
q Such words did Amphiaraus utter ;
and with joy will I myself too deck Alcmæon with garlands,r and sprinkle him with melody, because he, my neighbour, and the guardian of my wealth, met me, proceed­ ing to the navel of the earth, famed in story, and applied himself to his family arts of prophecy.
And thou, 0 Far-darter, ruling the glorious all-receiving temple in the dales of Pytho, there didst give the greatest of delights :
and formerly at homes thou didst bring to him the most pleasant gift of victory in the quinquertium, at the fes­ tival of you two, 0 Apollo and Artemis, and, 0 king, with willing mind I pray thee to look down upon the song,t such as I singu concerning each several conqueror.
Near our harmonious revel.v justice indeed takes her stand ;
but still I entreat the increasing care of the gods, 0 Xenarces, for the fortunes of thy house.
For if any man obtain praisesx with but slight toil, to many he seems wise among fools,y and to maintain z his life by prudent devices ;
a but these things lie not in the power of men, but Providence grants them ;
b which at one time exalts one man on high, and then again brings down another, so that he is beneath the level of hisc hands.
And at Megara thou hast the prize of victory, and in the recess of Marathon;
and the games in honour of Juno peculiar to the country d by three victories thou didst win by valiant toil, 0 Aristomenes.
And on four bodies e thou didst rush from above, with hostile intent,f to whom neither was a gladsome return alike as it was to thee decreed at the Pythian games, nor when they had come back to their mother, did the sweet laugh of those around excite their joy;
but in the by-lanes, in fearful suspense about their foes,g they cower, pierced through or tortured by their calamity.
But he who has obtained some lately-won glory during his tender years, excited by the great hope now before him, is borne aloft by the soaring spirit of his courage, having a careh superior to riches.
iIn brief period does the happiness of mortals increase ;
and so too does it fall to the ground, shaken by the sternj decree of the deity.
Creatures of a day!
What are we?
What are we not ?
k
Man is but the dream of a shadow.
But yet when heaven-sent glory comes, brilliant light is present to mortals, and gentle life.
0 Ægina, mother dear of thy race, for a free people do thou preservel this city with Zeus, and with king Æacus, and Peleus, and valiant Telamon, and with Achilles.
Inscribed to Telesicrates (son of Carneades), victorious in the armed foot- race :
01. 75, 3. B.C. 478 :
the ode was written and sung before the victor's return to Cyrene, probably at Thebes.—5 :
Proclamation of the praise of Telesicrates.
5—70 :
From the subject of Cyrene, the native place of the conqueror, the poet digresses to the tale of the marriage of Apollo and the nymph that gave her name to the colony, and the birth of Aristæus.
71—103 :
Praise of the conqueror, and short digression about Iolaus, who is brought forward as an instance of prudent observation of proper opportunity.
103—125 :
Tale of Alexidamus, an ancient Cyrenian, and ancestor of Telesicrates, who won a Libyan maiden of Irasa as wife, by swiftness of foot.
FAIN would I, proclaiming a him, sing with the aid of the deep-waisted Charites Telesicrates, the conqueror at Pytho, bearer of the brazen shield, wealthy hero, glory of Cyrene that drives the steed;
Cyrene,b whom formerly the son of Latona with long-flowing hair bore away from the wind-echoing glens of Pelion, and he brought in his golden chariot the huntress maiden to that place where he appointed her mistress of the land abounding in flocks and rich in fruits, so as to inhabit the third much-loved and blooming root of the con­ tinent.c
And silver-footed Aphrodite received the Delian stranger from his heaven-built chariot, laying hold of it with her aiding hand,d and upon their sweet nuptial couch she shed lovely reserve, uniting the bond of mutual wedlock entered into by the God and the daughter of powerful Hypseus.
Hypseus, who at that time was king of the mighty Lapithæ, by descent the second hero from Oceanus;
whom formerly, in the renowned dales of Pindus, the Naid Creusa daughter of Gaia, rejoicing in the bed of Peneus, brought forth.
Now hee reared his fair-armed daughter Cyrene :
she indeed loved neither the to-and-fro-walking paths of the loom,!
nor the pleasures of festivities with her companions that remained at home, but with brazen darts and with the sword fighting she slaughtered wild beasts;
giving, of a truth, much and tranquil security to her father's herds, and spending g sleep, the partner of the couch, sweet, though but short, falling upon her eyelids towards morning.
hHer formerly did the far-shooting Apollo, with beautiful quiver, find alone struggling without weapons against a mighty lion, and immediately he addressed Chiron with his voice, calling him from his dwelling :
"
Son of Phillyra, having left thy hallowed cave, wonder at the courage and mighty strength of a woman, what a contest she is waging with undaunted head, she a maiden having a heart superior to toil, and her spirit is not agitated with fear.
Who of men be,-at her, and dragged away from what stock,i doth she inhabit the hollows of the shady mountains ?
She enjoysk unbounded might.
Is it lawful to lay my divine hand1 upon her, or must I truly in marriage m pluck the honey-sweet flower of virginity ?
And to him the mighty Centaur, gently smiling with placid brow, forthwith gave in answer his counsel:
" Secret are keys by which wise Persuasion opens the way to sacred loves,n 0 Phoebus, and among both gods and men alike all feel shame at this, viz.
openly to obtain sweet wedlock at first.
And thee too, who canst not lie, soft passion has induced to put this covert question.0
And dost thou inquire the race of the maiden, 0 King, whence she is ?
Thou who knowest the fore-appointed issue of all things, aDd all their paths:
and how many leaves in spring-time the earth sends forth, and how many sands in the sea and in the rivers are tumbled by the waves and by the gusts of the winds, and what is to befall, and whence it will be, all this thou well perceivest :
but if it needs be that I match myself even with the wise,?
I will speak.
A spouse to this maiden hast thou come to this wooded glen, and thou art about across the sea to bear her to the distinguished garden of Zeus,q where thou shalt make her ruler of a state, having collected an island population to the hill surrounded by a plain.
But nowr the queenly Libya, with broad meadows, shall for thy sake receive the glorious nymph in her golden mansions, where she shall immediately give to her a portion of her land, so that it shall jointly belong to her by lawful right;
a portion neither without share of plants rich in fruits, nor unacquainted with wild beasts.
There shall she bring forth a son, whom renowned Hermes, having taken up from his dear mother, shall bear to the fair-throned Hours and to Mother Earth.
And they having placed the babe upon their knees, shall infuse nectar and ambrosia on his lips, and shall make him an immortal Zeus and holy Apollo ;
s 80 that since lie will be the most present t source 0 delight 30 men dear to him, and the tender of sheep, by some he may be called Agreus and Nomius, and by others Aristæus.
”Thus, then, having spoken, he urged Apollo to perfect the sweet accomplishment of marriage.
And swift, when they are in earnest, is the operation of the deities, and short the paths that they take to gain their ends
That day accomplished that matter, and they were united in the gold-adorned chamber of Libya, where sheu sways a city most fair and renowned in contests.
And now in divine
Pytho the son of Carneades has introduced herv to prosperous fortune, wherew having conquered he has proclaimed Cyrene as victor, which gra­ ciously shall receive him, bringing coveted glory from Delphi to his country abounding in fair women.
Mighty acts of prowess are ever famous in story ;
x but in abundant matter to speak a little with elegance is a thing for the wise to listen to, and the right proportion y is the greatest merit in everything alike.
Seven-gated Thebes in former times acknowledged that Iolaus too did not despise it ;
z Iolaus, whom after that he had destroyed Eurystheus with the edge of the sword, they buried beneath under the earth in the tomb of his grandsire, the charioteer Amphitryon, where his paternal grandsire lay, guest of the Sown Race,a having settled in the streets thronged with white steeds of the Cadmeans.
The sage Alcmena having had intercourse with him and with Zeus, brought forth at one birth the victorious strength of twain sons.
Dull must the man be who lends not his mouth tob Heracles, and does not ever make mention of the waters of Dirce, which nurtured him and Iphicles;
in their honour will I sing a triumphal hymn, when I shall have obtained some good perfected according to my prayer.
May the pure light of the loud-voiced Gracesc not fail me!
For at Ægina, I assert, and at the hill of Nisus,d that he has glorified this city thrice, having escaped by his deeds silent embarrassment.e
Wherefore, if any of the citizens is a friend, if any an enemy,f let him not concealg that which hath been nobly achieved in the public cause, disregarding the precept of the old man of the sea, Nereus;
for he bade men to praise, with all their soul, even an enemy when with justice performing noble exploits.
Very often victorious have the maidens beheld thee also in the solemnities recurring-at-fixed-seasons of Pallas, and in silenceh each for herself desired that thou, 0 Telesicrates, were her beloved husband or her son;
and in the Olympic games at Cyrene, and in those in honour of The Earth with deep valleys, and in all the games peculiar to the country have they also seen thee victorious.
But from me, whilst I desire to quench my poetic thirst, some onei exacts a debt, again to awake the song and the ancient glory of his ancestors :
j how for a Libyan woman they went to the city Irasa, as suitors to win the fair-haired renowned daughter of Antæus, whom very many princes of men her relatives sought in marriage, and many also of strangers ;
since her form was admirable;
and of her golden-crowned youth they each desired to pluck the blooming fruit.
But her father endeavouring to procure a more illustrious marriage for his daughter, had heard of Danaus, what swiftest nuptials he formerly in Argos found for his forty-and-eight virgin daughters, before midday overtook them.
For imme­ diately he placed the whole band at once at the boundaryk of the arena, and he bade all, as many as had come as their wooers, to decide by contests of feet which maiden each one of the heroes should possess.
And thus did the Libyan Antæus, joining her in marriage, give a bridegroom to his daughter :
at the line1 of the arena he placed her, having decked her in fair attire, to be the highest prize :
and before them all he said, that he, who first bounding forward should touch her garments with either hand around- should lead her away as his bride.
Then Alexidamus, when he had swiftly run the rapid course, taking the much-prized maiden by the hand with his hand, led through the crowd of the equestrian Pomades.
Many a leaf indeed and crown did they throw upon him ;
and many wings of victoryn had he previously obtained.
Inscribed to Hippocleas (son of Phricias ?) of Pelinnæum in Thessaly, victor in the race of the δίαυλ
ος of boys :
01. 69, 3—B.C. 502, when Pindar was only twenty years old :
sung probably, according to Bergk, by a chorus of the inhabitants of Cranon, on the entry of the triumphal procession into Larissa ;
according to Dissen, at Pelinnæum.1—30 :
The praise and illustrious descent of the conqueror and his family, the Aleuadæ.
Yet complete happiness cannot befall men:
no one can climb heaven, nor reach the Hyperboreans.
31—50 :
Yet Perseus feasted with them, through the favour and guidance of Athene.
51 :
Praises of the conqueror and his friend Thorax (one of the Aleuadæ), at whose request Pindar composed this ode.
HAPPY is Lacedaemon, blessed is Thessaly;
for the race of Heracles best-in-the-fight, descended from one father, reigns over both.
Do I boastfully utter aught out of due season ?
No, but Pytho a and Pelinnæum call aloud upon me, and the sons of Aleuas call aloud upon me, willing me to draw down on Hippocles the renowned voice belonging to the festal procession of men.
For he tries the contests;
and to the assembly of the neighbouring states the Parnasian vale has proclaimed him the first of the youthful racers in the double course.
0 Apollo, sweet is both the end and the commencement of human affairs made, when a deity gives the impulse :
he doubtless by thy counsels has accomplished this ;
and in re­ gard of family excellence, he has trod in the footsteps of his sire, twice Olympian victor in the war-sustaining arms of Ares ;
b and the contest held beneath the rock at Cirrha sur­ rounded by wide meadows, made Phricias victorious in the foot-race.
May fortune attend them, so that even in after days splendid wealth may bloom to them, and having ob­ tained of the things that are held delightful in Greece c no small share, may they not meet with envious reverses from the gods :
may the deity be propitious to them in heart !d
But blessed and to be sung by poets is that man, who by hands or by excellence of feet having gained the victory, has carried off the greatest of prizes by boldness and strength, and while still living shall have seen his youthful son duly obtaining the Pythian crowns.
The brazen floor of heaven indeed is never to be mounted by him, but as many glories as we of mortal race attain to, in these he reaches to the farthest voyaged
But neither by sea, nor travelling by land canst thou discover the wondrous path to the assembly of the Hyper­ boreans ;
with whom Perseus, the leader of the people, once feasted, having entered their mansions, when he came upon them sacrificing famous hecatombs of asses to the deity;
with whose festal banquets and songs of praise Apollo ever is especially delighted, and he laughs beholding the rampant wantonness of the beasts.
f
And in their habitsg the muse is not an alien from this nation ;
but everywhere choral bands of maidens, and the tones of lyres, and the sounds of flutes are agitated,h and with the golden laurel having wreathed their locks they feast joyously.
And neither disease nor de­ structive old age approaches1 the sacred race;
but apart from toils and battles they dwell, incurring not the penalty of rigorous Nemesis.
But breathing forth valour, the son of Danae in times past came, and Athene led him, to the throng of blessed men ;
and before that he visited the Hyperboreans he slew the Gorgon, and came bringing to the islanders j the head variegated with hair of snakes,k a stony death.
But, if the gods perform it, nought ever appears to be incredible for me to wonder at.
Rest thy oar, 0 Muse, and speedily fasten firm in the earth the anchor dropped from the prow, so as to be a bulwark against the sunken rock.
For the flower of hymns of praise, like a bee hovering here and there, directs my song at one time to one, and at another time to another.
lBut I trust, while the Ephyræans pour forth around the Peneus my sweet strain, to render with these my songs Hip­ pocleas even still more conspicuous among his equals in age and his elders on account of the crowns he has won, and to make him the object of care to youthful maidens.
For the love of different objects inwardly excites the minds of differ­ ent men;
but what each eagerly desires to gain, let each if he shall have obtained it, hold fast- his heart's desire, sur­ passing words, which he now possesses;
for what will happen in a year's time is without mark whereby to foreknow it.
I confide in the gentle friendship of Thorax," who eagerly desires my serviceso and has yoked the four-horsed car of the Pierides, loving me who love him in return, leading me who again lead him kindly.?

We shall praise indeed the noble brothers of Thorax,r be- cause they raise aloft the republic of the Thessalians, and promote its advancement ;
for the hereditary-cherished guidance of states is in the hands of the good.

Whom in truth, when his father was murdered, Arsinoe, his nurse, rescued from the cruel hands of Clytemnestra, out of the woeful stratagem, when the pitiless woman, with the bright brass sent, along with the spirit of Agamemnon to the shady bank of the Acheron, Dardanian Cassandra, daughter of Priam.

Moral reflections on the uncertainty of human happiness.
I BEG of thee, 0 lover of splendour, fairest of mortal cities, seat of Persephone, thou, who at the banks of Acragas grazed by sheep, inhabitest the hill covered by fair buildings, 0 Queen, propitiously to receive, with the good-will both of immortals and of men, this crown from glorious Midas, borne off from Pytho ;
and to receive the man himself that conquered Greecea in the art which, in times past, Pallas Athene discovered, weaving into measureb the deadly wail of the bold Gorgons;
which, from the maidens' heads, and from the unapproach­ able heads of the serpents, she heard poured forth in their direful distress, when Perseus slew the third portion of the sisters,c bringing destined ill both to the sea-girt Seriphus and to its inhabitants.
Truly he blinded the wondrous d race of Phorcus, and deadly did he render his marriage gift to Poly­ dectes, and deadly, too, his mother's long slavery, and her compulsory union;
after that he had violently taken off the head of the fair-cheeked Medusa, he, the son of Danae, who, we say, was sprung from self-flowing gold.
But when from these toils she had rescued the beloved hero, the maidene fashioned the many-toned melody of pipes, that, by means of instruments f she might imitate the loud- sounding wail which forced its ways from the rapidh jaws of Euryale.
The goddess invented it, but, having invented it for mortal men to possess, she named it the strain of many heads ;
i glorious remembrancer of games to which the people flock, when it passes through the slender brassy and through the reeds which grow near the city of the Charites, the citu with beautiful places for the dance ;

But if there be any happiness among men, it appears not 1 without toil;
but the Deity will surely, should he so please, accomplish it- even to-day.n
But destiny cannot be avoided ;
but that time will come, which, throwing a man into unex­ pected events,o will, contrary to his notions, give a part of what he looks for, and a part will not give.
NEMEAN Games (νέμεα, νεμει̃α, or νεμαι̃α), one of the four great national festivals of the Greeks.
It was held at Nemea, a place near Cleonæ in Argolis.
The various legends respecting its origin are related in the arguments of the Scholiasts to the Nemea of Pindar, with which may be compared Pausanias and Apollodorus.
All these legends, however, agre< in stating, that the Nemea were originally instituted by the Seven against Thebes, in commemoration of the death of Opheltes, afterwards called Archemorus.
When the Seven arrived at Nemea, and were very thirsty, they met Hypsipyle, who was carrying Opheltes, the child of the priest of Zeus and of Eurydice.
While she showed to the heroes the way to the nearest well, she left the child behind, lying in a meadow, which during her absence was killed by a dragon.
When the Seven on their return saw the accident, they slew the dragon, and instituted funeral games (ἀγὼν ἐπιτάϕιος), to be held every third year (τριετηρικός).
Other legends attribute the institution of the Nemean Games to Heracles, after he had slain the Nemean lion ;
but the more genuine tradition was, that he had either revived the ancient games, or at least introduced the alteration by which they were from this time celebrated in honour of Zeus.
That Zeus was the god in honour of whom the games were afterwards celebrated, is stated by Pindar.
The games wer" at l.rst of a warlike character, and only warriors and their sons were allowed to take part in them ;
subsequently, however, they were thrown open to all the Greeks.
The games took place in a grove between Cleonæ and Phlius.
The various games, according to the enumeration of Apollodorus, were horse-racing, running in armour in the stadium, wrestling, chariot-racing, and discus, boxing, throwing the spear, and shooting with the bow, to which we may add musical contests.
The Scholiasts on Pindar describe the agon very imperfectly as ίππικός and γυμνικός.
The prize given to the victors was at first a chaplet of olive branches, but afterwards a chaplet of green parsley.
When this alteration was introduced, is not certain, though it may be inferred from an expression of Pindar, who calls the parsley (σέλινον) the βοτάνα λεόντος, that the new prize was believed to have been introduced by Heracles.
The presidency at these games, and the management of them, belonged at different times to Cleonæ, (Cormth, and Argos, and from the first of these places they are sometimes called ἀγων Κλεώναιος.
The judges who awarded the prizes were dressed in black robes, and an instance of their justice, when the Argives presided, is recorded by Pausanias.
Respecting the time at which the Nemean Games were held, the Scholiast on Pindar merely states that they were held on the 12th of the month of Panemus, though in another passage he makes a statement which upsets this assertion.
Pausanias speaks of Winter N emea, and manifestly distin­ guishes them from others which were held in summer.
It seems that for a time the celebration of the Nemea was neglected, and that they were revived in Olympiad 53, 2, from which time Eusebius dates the first Nemead.
Hence­ forth it is certain they were for a long time celebrated regularly twice in every Olympiad, viz.
at the commence­ ment of every second Olympic year in the winter, and soon atter the commencement of every fourth Olympic year in the summer About the time of the battle of Marathon it became customary in Argolis to reckon according to Nemeads.
In 208 B.C. Philip of Macedonia was honoured by the Argives with the presidency of the Nemean Games, and Quinctius Flaminius proclaimed at the Nemea the freedom of the Argives.
The Emperor Hadrian restored the horse- racing of boys at the Nemea, which had fallen into disuse ;
but after his time they do not seem to have been much longer celebrated, as they are no longer mentioned by any of the writers of the subsequent period.
I nscribed to Chromius (son of Agesidamus and brother-in-law to Hiero), victorious in the chariot-race at Nemea:
01. 76, 4. B.C. 473, shortly after the founding of the city Ætna :
sung in the island of Ortygia, in the vestibule of the victor's house, probably in the presence of Pindar.
1 —33:
Invocation of Ortygia, praise of Sicily, and of Chromius, for his hospitality, &c. 33—72 :
Digression on the prowess shown by Heracles whilst yet in the cradle, and the prophecy of Tiresias of his future exploits.
(Cf. Müller, Hist. of Greek Lit. p. 224.)HALLOWED resting-place of the Alpheus, Ortygia, scion a of renowned Syracuse, couch b of Artemis, sister of Delos,c from thee the sweet-sounding hymn proceeds to set forth the mighty praise of the storm-footed steeds, for the sake of d Ætnæan Zeus ;
and the car of Chromius and Nemea bid me yoke a melody of praise to their victorious deeds.
And foundations from the gods were laid together with the marvellous worth of that man.e
And in success is the highest summit of absolute glory;
and the Muse loves to rememberf mighty contests.
Scatter now some bright praise for the island which Zeus, the lord of Olympus, gave to Persephone, and confirmed to her by shaking his locks,? that he would supporth prosperous Sicily, fairest spot of the fruitful earth, by the wealthy ex­ cellence of cities.
i
And the son of Cronus granted to her a people fighting on horseback, mindful of brazen-armed war, and often too brought close toi the goldenk leaves of the Olympian olives.
I have touched upon the season ably-offered abundance of many subjects,lhurling no falsehood.m
And I have taken my stand at the doors of the court of an hospitable man, singing his fair praises, where a meet banquet has been adorned for me, and the palace, too, is not without experience of strangers from a foreign soil;
and he has obtained by his kindness good men asfriends against those who slander, so as to oppose water against smoke.
nBut various are the arts o of different men, and it behoves every man walking in the straight path to contend by P his natural abilities.
For strength works with action,q but mind in counsel, so that they to whom it belongs by naturer can foresee the future.
O son of Agesidamus, in thy way of life,, are to be seen the uses t both of these excellences and of those."
I love not to keep great wealth concealed in my house, but to have the enjoy­ ment of my possessions, and to be well spoken of as thence assisting my friends ;
and a man is wise who does so ;
for the fearsv of much-suffering men come impartial.
wBut I zealously cleave to Heracles,x arousing the ancient tale concerning his mightiest deeds of valour ;
y how that, as soon as from the womb of his mother, escaping the pang of her who bore him, the son of Zeus came forth with his twin brother into wondrous light,z how that, I say, he went down into a the saffron-dyed swaddling-band, not having escaped the notice of Here of the golden throne;
but the Queen of the gods, incensed in her spirit, forthwith sent serpents.
They indeed, the gates having been opened,b went to the wide recess of the inmost chamber, eagerly desiring to entwine around the children their swiftly-moving jaws ;
but lie raised against them erect his head, and first essayed the battle, having seized by the throatsthe two serpents with hands from which none could escape, and from them thus strangled, lapse of time extinguished the lives fromtheir enormous limbs.
c
But straightway an intolerable shaft of fear struck the female attendants, as many as happened to be giving succour at the couch of Alcmena ;
for she herself, inasmuch as theyfled infear, having leaped from her couch upon her feet undressed, yetd endeavoured to repel the fury of the monsters.
And quickly the leaders of the Cadmeans, clad in brazen arms, thronging ran in, and Amphitryon came brandishing a sword naked of its scabbard, A mphitryon, smitten by sharp grief
For a woe of his own presses every one alike, but the heart is soon untroubled concerning another's grief.
And he stood affected with grievous and sweet amazement.
For he beheld the uncommon courage and might of his son ;
and the immortals had made the.
tidings of the messengers to be contradictory.
And he summoned the distinguished prophet of highest Zeus, who dwelt near at hand, the true seer Tiresias;
and he explained to him and to all his host what fortunes he, Heracles, should meet with, how many lawless monsters he should slay on the land, and how many in the ocean ;
and many a most hateful man walking in crooked insolence did the prophet assert that he, Heracles, should give to death.
For when, too, the gods in the plain of Phlegra should advance in battle against the giants, by the blows of his shafts, he said, that their splendid hair should be defiled with dust;
but that he verily in peace for all time should obtain for ayee rest, having received the excellent reward of his mighty toils,!
in blissful mansions having received blooming Hebe as his bride, and celebrating his marriage feast, dwelling near Zeus the son of Cronus, should be content with g his august home.
Inscribed to Timodemus, an Athenian, victorious in the Pancratium :
date unknown :
sung at Athens.
1—5 :
As the Homeridæ begin from Zeus, so Timodemus has won his first victory in the grove of Nemean Zeus.
6 —25 :
He will win also in the Isthmian and Pythian games ;
a prediction supported by the numerous triumphs of the natives of Salamis and the Acharnians, with whom the family of Timodemus was connected.
WHENCE the Homeridæ, bards of continuous strains, generally commence the opening of their song from Zeus, so also,, has this man received b the first commencement of victory in the sacred games, in the grove famed in song of Nemean Zeus.
It is still due, if destiny, c guiding him straight in the path that his father trod,d hath given him an ornament to mighty Athens, that the son of Timonous should also cull the fairest prime of the Isthmian games, and should conquer in the Pythian contests.
And it is reasonable that Orion should advance not far from the mountain Pleiads.
eBut Salamis, in sooth, has power to rear a warrior hero.
In Troy, indeed, Hector heard off the force of Ajax ;
and thee, 0 Timodemus, the sturdy-souled might of the pancra­ tium will promote to honour.
And Acharnæ, famed of ancient days, abounds in heroes ;
and as concerns all things in the games,g the Timodemidæ are named before all others as far superior.
Near lofty Parnassus first, they bore off six victories from the contests;
but,h at the hands of Corinthian men as judges of the games, in the winding vales of valiant Pelops, they, before this time, were brought near to i eight crowns ;
and seven they Mon in Nemea;
and at home in Athens, more than can be counted in the contest of Zeus.k Whom,l 0 citizens, celebrate in your songs for Timodemus’ sake at his glorious return, and begin the song with sweet-strained voice.
Inscribed to Aristocleides (son of Aristophanes) of Ægina, victorious in the Pancratium.
The ode was composed long after the victory which it celebrates, and was sent to Ægina and sung at the commemoration of the victory on the return of the Nemean festival, before the conquest of Ægina by the Athenians :
01. 80, 3 or 4. B.C. 458 or 457.1—12 :
Proemium.
Invocation of the Muse.
12—26 :
The praise of Aristocleides, whom the poet declares to have performed deeds worthy of the ancient Myrmidons, and to have reached the pillars of Hercules.
26—64 :
Eulogy of the valiant acts of the Æacidæ, through all the three stages of human life.
65—end :
The poet returns to Aristo­ cleides, and completes the catalogue of his achievements.
0 HONOURED Muse, our mother, I entreat thee, come on the high festival of the Nemean games to the Doric isle Ægina, frequented by many a stranger.
Since by the water of the Asopus, youths who build honied songs of triumph await, eagerly expecting thy voice.
One deed thirsts for one reward, and another for another, and victory in the games most loves the song, the meetest attendant of crowns of victory and deeds of excellence.
Of which melody a bounteous supply afford from my skill.
But commence, 0 Muse, daughter of Zeus, the excellent hymn to the Lord of the cloudy heaven, and I will join it to their lays and to the lyre.
And Zeus will hold this thy labour pleasing, the ornament as it were of the land,a where dwelt of old the Myrmidons, whose anciently-famed assembly oj the games Aristocleides, by thy ordinance,b did not disgrace with the reproach of cowardice, by yielding, in the very mighty host of the Pancratium;
but of wearisome blows a wholesome remedy, viz.
the praise of victory in Nemea certainly with-the-deep-plain, doth he bear off.
cBut since, fair of person and achieving deeds worthy of his form, the son of Aristophanes has reached the highest praises of manhood, yet no further onwards it is easy for him to traverse the impassable sea beyond the pillars of Heracles, which the hero-god placed as illustrious witnesses of his farthest voyaging;
and he subdued enormous monsters in the deep, and he thoroughly searched out the streams of the swamps until he reached the home-conducting goal of his return, d and he defined the earthyMy spirit, to what foreign promontoryf dost thou turn aside my course ?
To Æacus and to his race I bid thee bring thy Muse.
And the bloom of justice, which is to praise the brave, attends this my word;
nor are desires for what is alien preferable for a man to have.g
Seek for subject matter at home and thou hast already a fitting theme for praise, so as to sing something sweet.
In ancient excellence h Peleus rejoiced,i when he had cut his exceeding great spear;
Peleus, who too alone without an army took Iolcos, and won maritime Thetis not without toil.
And widely-potent Telamon, the comrade of Iolaus, overcame Laomedon;
and of yore he followed himk against the might of the Amazons armed with the brazen bow, nor did fear that tameth men quell the vigour of his soul.
But, by innate excellence one mightily prevails;
but he who hath only what he has learnt, he, I say, a man destitute of real worth, being of one spirit at one time and of another at another time, never descends1 with a sure foot, but tries at numberless excellences with a mind that completes nothing.
The yellow-haired Achilles dwelling at first m in the home of Philyra, being a child used to play at mighty deeds, often brandishing with his hands his javelin with short head, and like the winds in swiftness used in combat to work slaughter on the fierce lions, and used to slay wild boars, and bore their breathless bodies n to the Centaur the son of Cronus;
as soon as he was six years old, and so he did through all the after time:
him would Artemis and the bold Athena look with marvel on, as he slew the stags without the aid of dogs and ensnaring nets ;
for he prevailed by swiftness of foot.
But I have to tell this tale told by those of former days;
how that sage Chiron reared Jason within his strong roof, and next Asclepius, whom he taught the soft-handed adminis­ tering of remedies ;
and how that at another time he gave in marriage to Peleus Nereus' daughter with her fair fruits,o and reared for her her mightiest offspring, nourishing his whole soul with all that was befitting • in order that, wafted by the sea-blasts of the winds beneath Troy, he might withstand the spear-clashing war-cry of the Lycians and Phrygians and Dardanians, and engaging his hands in battle with the spear-bearing Ethiopians, that he might fix it in his mind,P that their master Memnon, the bold cousin of Helenus, might no more return back home.
The far-shining glory of the Æacidæ is attached to this quarter ;
q 0 Zeus, thee I address, for they (the Æacidæ) are thy blood, and to thee belongs the Nemean contest, which my hymn has aimed at,r chanting with the voices of youths sweet praises in honour of the land.
And a loud acclaim well befits victorious Aristocleides, who has wedded to glorious report this island and the holy Theorion by his glorious endeavours to obtain victory in the games.
In trial the perfection of those things is cicarly seen, In which a man is superior to others;
and thus is the superiority of Aristocleides seen, as a child among young children, and as a man among men, and a third time among the elders ;
according to the portion of life which we severally hold, (,e the race of mortals.
And length of life brings also four excellences,t and bids us think wisely of the presents From which he is not distant.
vFarewell, my friend!
I send in truth to thee this honey mingled with white milk,w and the mingled foamx hangs round the brim, a draught to be sung with the Æolian breath of flutes, late though it be.
But amongst the winged ones the eagle is swift;
the eagle that suddenly seizes, though chasing after it from afar, his blood-stained prey with his talons;
but croaking daws haunt the lowly regions.
On thee, fair-enthroned Clio favouring, on account of thy vic­ torious courage, from Nemea and from Epidaurus, and from Megara too hath the light of glory shone.
Inscribed to Timasarchus (son of Timocritus) of Ægina, victorious in the wrestling-match of beys ;
probably shortly before 01.
80. B.C. 456;
sung in Egina while the procession was moving through the streets of the city.
Proemium.
1—8 :
The power of song to refresh and solace after the toils of the contest.
9—32 :
Praise of the victories of Timasarchus.
32—69:
The poet recalls himself from this theme, and after con­ descending to notice and castigate those who maligned him and his poetic powers, passes on to the praise of the race of the Æacidæ and their worship in many lands.
69—end:
Praise of the race of the Theandridæ (the conqueror's family);
of Callicles the uncle;
and Euphanes a poet, the grandfather of the conqueror;
and Melesias, his training-master.
THE mirth of the banquet is the best physician for toils that are decided;
but sage lays, daughters of the Muses, soothe him when they reach him.
Nor doth warm water so much refresh-by-moistening the limbs, as praise linked with the lyre.
And words outlive the deeds they celebrate, whatever words, with the aid of the Charites, the tongue may draw out from the deep heart.
May it be allowed me to dedicate this strainb to Zeus son of Cronus, and to Nemea and to the wrestling of Timesar­ chus, as a prelude to my hymn;
and may the fair-towered seat of the Æacidæc receive it, Ægina which is, by its justice that aideth the stranger, a common lightd to all.
But if thy father Timocritus were still warmed by the enlivening sun, oft harping the changeful strain, he would, inclining his mind to this song, have swelled the hymn of victory which sends thee the wreath of garlands both from the Cleonæan contest,e and from brilliant honoured Athens, and won in seven-gated Thebes;
since near the stately tomb of Amphitryon the Cadmæans not unwilling covered him with flowers for Ægina's sake.
For coming as a friend to friends, he passed down the hospitable city to the blissful hall of Heracles,f with whom of yore the mighty Telamon over­ threw Troy and the Meropes and the huge warrior terrific Alcyoneus, yet not before he had destroyed twelve four­ yoked cars with a mass of rock, and twice as many heroes, tamers of the steed, that rode therein.
That man would appear unskilled in the fortune of war,g who does not under­ stand the old proverb;
for it is likely that " he who does must also suffer."
hBut to make a long digression, the law of my song and the hastening hours forbid me;
and by a charm am I drawn away to touch upon the day of the new-moon.
1
Nevertheless, 0 my heart, although the deep ocean brine holds thee up to the waist, resist the treachery and then we shall seem, far superior to our adversaries, to departk in glory;
but sont other man with envious look revolves a vain thought in secret, coming to nought.
But to me whatever excellence ruling destiny has assigned, well I know that coming time shall accomplish it, predestined.
1Weave, my sweet lyre, this strain also forthwith, conjoined with Lydian harmony, beloved by Œnonem and by Cyprus too, where Teucer the son of Telamon rules far from his native soil;
but Ajax sways as a tutelary god his paternal native Salamis ;
and in the Euxine Sea Achilles rules a bright island;
and Thetis rules in Pthia, and Neoptolemus in far-stretching Epirus, where the projecting promontories that give pasture to the cattle gradually slope, beginning from Dodona, to the Ionian Sea.
But Iolcos at the foot of Pelion, did Peleus, having approached it with hostile hand, give reduced to slavery, to the Hæmonians,n having experienced the crafty arts of Hippolyta the spouse of Acastus.
And by means of the cunningly-wrought sword, Acastus the son of Pelias by ambuscade was preparing death for him;
o but Chiron warded off the danger and brought what was destined by Zeus to its accomplishment;
and having quelled all-mighty fire and sharpest claws of daring lions, and the edge of direst teeth, he wedded one of the high-throned Nereids, and beheld the orbed throne, seated on which the kings of heaven and of ocean showed forth to himp the gifts and the power that would endure to his posterity.
Beyond the westward of Gadeiraq we cannot pass :
turn back again to the land of Europa the tackling of the ship ;
for it would be impossible to me to go through the whole tale of the sons of Æacus.
And for the Theandridæ have I come a ready herald of the games that-strengthen-the-limbs at Olympia, and at the Isthmus, and at Nemea too, by agreement.
Where as often as they contend, they return not home without crowns glori­ ous with fruit;
where we hear that thy clan, 0 Timasarchus, ministers tor the lays of victory.
But if in truth thou biddest me also raise for Callicles thy mother's brother a pil­ lar whiter than Parian stone, gold when refined throws out full lustre, and a hymn that tells of valiant deeds makes a man equal in fortune to kings;
therefore let him though dwelling rear Acheron, obtain my loud-sounding tongues at the Isthmian games, where, in the contest of the deep-roaring Wieldor of the trident, he flourished with Corinthian pars­ ley ;
t whom Euphanes, thy aged grandsire, 0 boy, in timse past sang.
But to different persons there are different contemporaries;
u but what each has seen, these deeds each one thinks he him­ self can best tell.
In what manner would one that should praise Melesias twist back the strife, v interweaving his words,w unconquer­ able in his songx for his antagonist to overthrow, gentle- minded towards the good, but a fierce opponent to his adversaries.

No sculptor am I so as to carve statues that will stand stationary and rest firm upon their base, a but upon every vessel of burthen and light bark,b sweet song, proceed forth from Ægina, and announce abroad that Pytheas, the mighty son of Lampo, has borne off the wreath of the Pancratium at Nemea, though not showing on his chin the bloom of summer-hue, tender mother of the.
vine-down, and has honoured the warrior heroes the Æacidæ, sprung up from Cronus and Zeus and from the golden Nereids, and his mother-country, a land friendly to strangers.
Which, formerly standing by the altar of the Hellenian father, the renowned sons of Endais and the might of kingly Phocus prayed might be blessed with brave men and renowned for ships, and stretched forth together their hands to heaven—Phocus, I say, the son of the goddess, whom Psamathea bore on the shore of the ocean.
I fear to tell of a monstrous deed ventured upon not with justice, how in truth they came to leave the glorious island and what fortune drove the valiant heroes from CEnone.
I will pause :
not every truth, though strictly true, is better for showing its face ;
d and silence is often the wisest thing for a man to understand.
But if it be resolved by me to praise their wealth, or their might of hands, or steel-clad war, let some one mark me out long leaps from this point :
e I have a light spring of the knees, and so do the eagles fly beyond the ocean.
And graciously to them too did the most lovely band of the Muses sing on Pelion, and in the midst of them did Apollo, running over the seven-tongued lyre with the golden quill, lead through all the various moods.
f
And they in the first place, commencing the song from Zeus, hymned the revered Thetis and Peleus, and how delicate Hippolyta, daughter of Cretheus, sought to destroy him by craft, having persuaded his friend the king of the Magnesians her consort by cunning plots, and she concocted a false fabricated tale, namely, how that he attempted nuptial intercourse with her in the mar­ riage couch of Acastus :
but the contrary was the truth ;
for often and with all her might guilefully-speaking did she entreat him.
His soul the holds words stung;
and forth­ with he refused the embrace of the bride, fearing the wrath of the host-protecting Sire.
But Zeus, the monarch of the immortals, that raiseth the clouds, perceived the deed from heaven, and promised that soon he would obtain one of the Nereids with spindles of gold as an ocean bride for him, having persuaded Poseidon their kinsman, who from Ægæ oft resorts to the famed Dorian Isthmus, where joyous bands with the noise of the pipe receive him their god, and contend with the hardy strength of limbs.
But the innate gift that each man has, gives decision about all achievements.h
And thou in Ægina, 0 Euthymenes, having fallen into the arms of the goddess Victory, hast obtained hymns of varied strain.
Surely even now too thy uncle praises his kindred sprung from the same ancestors,j O Pytheas, who has followed closely in his steps.
Nemea, favours him and the month of his country,k which Apollo loved;
and those of his own age who came to contest against him did he conquer, both at home1 and at the hill of Nisus with sweet glades.
And I rejoice, because the whole city contends for distinctions.
mKnow that thou hast obtained, with the aidn of Menander, a sweet return of thy toils :
and it is right that from Athens should come the master of athletes.

But if thou hast come to sing Themistius, slack no more in zeal:
utter thy voice, and stretch forth the sails to the yard-arm of the mast-head, and proclaim him as a boxer, and that he has carried off a double prize in the Pancratium at Epidaurus,P and to the vestibule of Æacus brought grassly chaplets of flowers, by the favour of the yellow-haired Charites.

Second part, of the ode.
The poet sets forth the praises of the Bassidæ and of Ægina, making a passing mention also of the Æacidæ.
ONE is the race of men, another is the race of gods, but from one mother we both draw our breath ;
a but a capacityb alto­ gether different separates the races of men and gods;
since the one is nought, whilst the brazen heaven remaineth ever a firm seat for the other.
But still in some respect do we re­ semble the immortals, either in mighty mind or in bodily frame, though we know not to what goal of life either by day or night fate has written for us to run.
And now Alcimidas proves the innate talent of his race,c so that we can see it like as in fruitful fields ;
which alter­ nately at one time give to men the plenteous sustenance of the plains, and then at another time resting, collect their strength.
From the fair contests of Nemea came the youth that contended in the games, who desiring to obtain this fortune granted him by Zeus, hath now appeared no luckless hunter in the wrestling, moving his foot in the footsteps of Praxi­ damas, his kindred grandsire.
For he being a conqueror at Olympia, was the first to crown himself with wreaths of olive from the Alpheus in honour of the Æacidæ, and by winning the crown five times at the Isthmus and thrice at Nemea.
took away the obscurity of Socleides, who was the eldest of I lie sons of Agesimachus.d
Since the three winners of the prizes, who tried the toil, have reached the summit of glory.
But no other family has the boxing-match displayed, under divine favour, as the stewarde of more crowns, in any corner of all Hellas.
I trust, though speaking a bold word, to hit the mark before me, sending forth my shaft as from a bow :
come, 0 muse, direct straight to this family a fair gale of poetry of good report.
For of their heroes that have passed away bards and stories have preserved for them the glorious deeds, and these are not lacking among the Bassidæ :
a race famed in ancient story, freighted with their own praises, are able to afford, through their lordly deeds, matter for much song to those that till the field of the Pierides.
fFor thus too in divine Pytho, having his hands bound with the thong,g did Callias, a descendant of this family, of yore prevail, pleasing the scionsh of Latona who wields the golden spindle, and near Castalia too at evening tide he shonei in the loud chant of the Charites :
the unwearied bridge too of ocean,k in the third-yearly festival of the surrounding states when the bull is slain, honoured Creontidas in the sacred pine grove of Poseidon ;
and the lion's fodderl has often of old decked him victorious beneath the shady primeval moun­ tains of Phlius.
Wide from all sides are the approaches for those skilled in ancient story to adorn with praise this famous isle;
since to them m the Æacidæ gave surpassing fortune by displaying mighty deeds of valour.
Over both land and across the sea afar does their name spread;
even to the Ethiopians, for that Memnon returned not home, did it fly, and a grievous contest Achilles showed them, when having descended from his car he slew the bright son of Eos with the point of his wrathful spear.
And this highway of praise the bards of ancient days dis­ covered, and I too myself follow with all eager zeal :
n but that one of the waves which in succession rolls before the keel of the ship is said most to disturb each sailor's mind.
0
But on willing back carrying a double burdenP have I come as a herald of Alcimidas’ fame, singing this vic­ tory the fifth in addition to twenty won from the games which men call sacred, which too the renowned race of Alcimidas has furnished to be celebrated in song.
Two Olympic crowns indeed by the precinct of Cronium did the random lot deprive thee, 0 youth, of, thee and Polytimidas.
Equal to the dolphin through the brine in swiftness could I tell of Melesias, Milesias the trainer of hands and of strength.

The mythical portion of the ode.
Ulysses has been honoured even more than he deserved by the poetry of Homer :
Ajax and Neoptolemus, though they both met with a grievous death, are now held in everlasting honour and renown.
50—end :
The poet returns to the subject before him;
praises Thearion, the father of Sogenes, speaks in his own defence and his friends, against the censures of the Æginetans, praises Sogenes, and ends by invoking Heracles to protect the family.
ILITHYIA, assessor of the deep-counselling Fates, child of Here of mighty strength, hear, 0 thou that bringest children to the light:
without thee we reach not to thy sister Hebea with fair limbs, neither beholding the light nor the dark night.
b
But we have not breath all alike for similar achieve­ ments, and various destinies restrain each man differently, as he is severally bound by fate.
By thy aid too Sogenes the son of Thearion, distinguished for his prowess, is sung glorious in the contests of the five exercises.
For he dwells in the city of the spear-clashing Æacidæ, the city that loves to hear the song of victory ;
and greatly do they desire to cherish a spirit skilled in contests.
But if any one succeed in the contest, he affords delicious subject of song to the streams of the Muses;
for mighty feats of strength are clouded by great obscurity, if they lack the aid of hymns :
but for noble deeds we know a mirror in this way only,c if, through Mnemosyne with the bright tiara, a man wins the recompense of his toils by the far- famed songs of poetry.
And the wise have learnt when the wind will blow on the third day, and lose not all through desire of gain.d
The wealthy and the poor alike come to death.
But I believe that the fame of Odysseus is become greater than in proportion to what he suffered, through the sweet poet Homer:
since in his fictions and his winged art a something majestic dwells and his skill deceives us, leading the mind astray by fabled lore ;
but the more numerous crowd of men have a blind spirit.
For if it were possible that it could see the truth,e never would the mighty Ajax enraged about the arms have driven the polished sword through his breast-
Ajax whom most mighty in battle except Achilles, the guidance of the straight-blowing Zephyrus conveyed in swift ships to the city of Ilus, that he might bring back his spouse for the yellow-haired Menelaus.
But the wave of death comes alike on all, and it falls on the inglorious and on the glorious.
f
But there ariseth honour for those heroes whose beauteous fame the Deity increases in aid of the memory of the deceased,g who have come to the great navel of wide­ bosomed earth.
But in.
Pythian plains, after that he had sacked the city of Priam, Neoptolemus lies buried ;
the city of Priam where the Danai toiled.
Sailing thence away he missed the isle of Scyros, and wandering from their course he and his companions arrived at Ephyra.
Then in Molossia he reigned a brief while, but his family after him ever bore this regal honour;
and he departed to the godh and bore with him rich gifts of the first-fruits of the spoils brought from Troy;
and therei a man smote him with a knife, as he foll into a quarrel with him about the carcase of the victims, and exceeding grieved were the hospitable Delphians;
but he only paid the debt of fate;
for it was decreed by destiny, that some one of the kingly Æacidæ entombed in that most ancient hallowed lawn, should for all time to come abide near the fair-built shrine of the god, and that he should there dwell, keeping order over the festal processions in honour of the heroes attended with many a sacrifice, so that honoured justice may preside there.
Three words will suffice;
no false witness presides over the contests.
jI have courage to sing this a proper course of song derived from their own family in honour of the brilliant virtues, O Ægina, of thine and Zeus' children ;
k but / will not prolong my praises, for in every work repose from toil is sweet, and even honey and the pleasant flowers of Aphrodite can pall.
In natural powers we all differ according to the manner of life that is allotted to each, one having for his share one species of talent and others another;
but it is impossible that one individual should be so fortunate as to bear off every kind of happiness :
I can mention none to whom Fate has given this height of happiness to last.
But O Thearion, to thee she gives a befitting measure of wealth, and takes
Dot away thy intellect of soul after thou hadst had the courage to undertake noble deeds.
1
I am thy guest-friend:
removing far dark slander, I will praise thee with a truly glorious praise, bringing as it were streams of water to a man I love:
and this reward is suitable to the good.
An Achaean man who dwells above- the sea of Ionia, were he near at hand, would not blame me ;
n I rely on my tie of friendship with them;
and amongst my own compatriots I look round with serene eye, never having overstepped moderation, and having removed far apart from me all that is violent:
and may all future time come joyous to me !
And he that shall have clearly learnt, shall declare whether I go beyond the harmony of my strain, pouring forth a slanderous song.0 thou by race a Euxenid, Sogenes, I swear that I have not, going beyond the boundary, flung forth my swift tongue as it were a brass-barbed javelin, which sometimes lets go free0 from the wrestling-match the neck and strength of the athlete, unmoistened by sweat, before that his body is exposed to the scorching sun.
P
If toil it were, yet the joy succeeds more abundant.
Permit me, in having thus digressed from my subject :
even though somewhat borne beyond my subject I have lifted up my voice, yet I am not niggardly in paying to a conqueror his due praise.

tBut rememberingu Zeus for Nemea's sake,v softly rouse, 0 my soul, the noble strain of song.
It behoveth on this soil w to celebrate the king of the gods with gentle voice;
for they say that he begot Æacus by seed received by his mother the nymph .
Etima, Æacus, I say, the monarch of his own renowned country and thy kindly-disposed guest-friend, O Heracles, and brother.
But if one man in any way receives benefit from another man, we should assert that a neighbour that loveth with faithful mind, is to a neighbour a blessing worth every other ;
and if this too x the Deity would sanction by thy favour, thine, who didst subdue the giants, Sogenes may be able, cherishing a mind obedient to his sire, happily to inhabit the wealthy hallowed street of his ancestors :
since like as in the car yokes in which four steeds are driven, he has his house, on either hand that he goeth, between thy shrines.
yO blessed one,z thee it becometh to persuade both the spouse of Here and the maid with gleaming eyes to give their aid ;
and thou hast power to give aid to mortals oft against insur­ mountable difficulties.
Would that, for them, having joined a life unruffled in youth to a brilliant old age,a thou mayest bring it to a close in happiness, and may their children's children ever hold the honour that they now held and here­ after even more.
But my heart shall never allow that it has carped at Neoptolemus with unseemly words.
To repeat the same thing three or four times over, like one who foolishly repeateth to children "
Corinth belongs to Zeus, is but poverty of intellect.

But delightful it is, when, not missing good fortune in every other matterb one is able to obtain successful love.
And in such way the loves the dispensers of the gifts of the Cypnan goddess attended round the couch of Zeus and Ægina;
and a son was born, king of (Enone, surpassing in might and wisdom.
Him oft did many pray to see ;
for uncalled the flower of heroes that dwelt around were willing of their own accord to obey his behests;
both those who in rugged Athens ruled their people, and the Pelopidæ in Sparta.
A suppliant of Æacus both for the loved city and for the citizens, I touch his holy knees;
bearing a Lydian fillet,c em­ bellished with loud sounds of the flute, Nemean ornament of the two victories in the stadium of Deinis and of his father Meras.
Bliss, surely, that hath been planted for mankind by the favour of Providence, will abide most lastingly:
—Providence that loaded Cinyras too with wealth of yore in sea-girt Cyprus.
I stand on light feet,d and drawing in my breath before I say aught.
For much and in many ways has been told of Cinyras;
but to devise novel inventions e and to sub­ ject them to the test of men's judgment for examination is very perilous;
for the praises you may bestow on others are a treat for the envious to feed on, and envy ever attacks the good, but does not molest the mean.
Even the son of Telamon did it f torture and make to fall upon his sword.
For of a truth one, who though brave of heart is not eloquent, oblivion often falls on in an evil contest;
?
but the greatest reward is held out as a premium to wily falsehood.
For thus with fraudulent suffrages the Greeks unjustly took the side of Odysseus, and Ajax deprived of the golden arms wrestled with death.h
Yet indeed very different were the wounds that they,' when warring,J inflicted with the spear that-defendeth-heroes on the livingk persons of then foes, as well when fighting round the freshly-slain Achilles, as on the deathful days of other toils.
Hateful then we may conclude in former times also was deceitful speech,1 the companion of wily words, meditating guile, ill-report that maketh mischief, which attacks what is illustrious, but upholds the false glory of the obscure men.
May I never have this character, m father Zeus, but may I hold to the guileless paths of life, that after my death I may attach no shameful reputation to my children.
Some men there are who pray for gold, others for land without limit;
but may I, after having so lived, also lay my limbs in the con­ cealment of the earth belovedn by my fellow-citizens, praising what is praisew( rthy, and scattering censure on the sinful.
The glory of mighty deeds increases, as when a tree shoots upfostered by the fresh dews, raised by the wise and just of meno to the liquid sky.
Manifold are the uses of friends :
the aid they give in difficulties ranks the highest:
yet even joy desires to have assurance put before its eyes.
P0 Megas, to bring back thy spirit from the dead is not possible for me :
futile is the end of my empty hopes;
but for thy house and the Chariadæq it is within my power to erect a great column of the Muses in honour of the twice two glorious feet.
rI rejoice in pouring forth a fitting praise upon an exploit performed ;
and by the magic charm of song one hath often caused toil to be free from pain.
Of a truth the laudatory hymn existed long ago, even before the strife arose between Adrastus and the Cadmeans.
I iscribed to Chronius, son of Agesidamus of Ætna ;
victorious in the chariot-race at the Pythian games in Sicyon;
to whom also the first Nemean Ode is inscribed.
The ode was composed some years after the victory which it celebrates, probably in 01. 77, 1. B.C. 472.
It is to be observed that the last three so-called Nemean Odes do not celebrate Nemean victories.
" Some of the epinikia," says Müller (Hist. of the Lit. of Ancient Greece, p. 221), " belong to other games.
For example, the second Pythian is not a Pythian Ode, but probably belongs to games of Iolaus at Thebes.
The ninth Nemean celebrates a victory in the Pythia at Sicyon, not at Delphi.
The tenth Nemean celebrates a victory in the Hecatombæa at Argos.
The eleventh Nemean is not an epinikion, but was sung at the installation of a prytanis at Tenedos.
Probably the Nemean Odes were placed at the end of the collection, after the Isthmian ;
so that a miscellaneous supplement could be appended to them.

The ode concludes in a joyous and festive strain, with a promise of some future encomiastic songs that may be sung at the banquet, after the procession of the victor.
LET us go in joyous procession from Apollo,a 0 ye Muses, from Sicyon, to the newly-founded Ætna, to the joyous house of Chromius, where the wide-opened doors give way to the guests.
Come then, achieve the sweet poetic hymn.
For mounting his car victorious in the race he announces a song in honour of the motherb and her twin children,c the joint watchers over lofty Pytho.
There is a certain saying among men that one should not conceal in the ground in silence a brave deed well accom­ plished ;
for a divine strain of poetry is fitting to mighty praises.d
But come, let us arouse the sounding lyre and the pipe to tell of the very prime of equestrian contests, which Adrastus ordained for Phœbus on the streams of the Asopus;
which I calling to mind, will adorn with renowned honours the hero, who then reigning there, with new fes­ tivals and with contests of the strength of men, and with cars adorned-with-carving, did proclaim and ennoble the stated For he fled from Amphiaraus the-bold-in-thought and from dread sedition, far away from the home of his fathers and from Argos;
and the sons of Talausf were no longer rulers, having been prevailed over by faction.
But a superior man ends a former quarrel.g
And theyh by giving Eriphyle who slew her lord as a wife to the SOIl of Oicleus, like as one gives a faithful pledge of alliance, became the greatest of the yellow-haired Danai.
Thereupon indeed did they of yore lead to the seven-gated Thebes a host of men in the path of unpropitious omens;
nor did the son of Cronus by whirling round his lightning incite them, maddened as they were, to march from their homes, but he bade them abstain from their journey.
So then the crowd pressed on to arrive at manifest destruction, with their brazen coats of armour and with the trappings of their steeds :
and upon the banks of the Ismenus having averted from themselves sweet return,i they fed the pale smoke with their corpses.j
For seven pyres consumed the seven heroes with youthful limbs:
but for Amphiaraus Zeus with his all­ powerful bolt clove the deep-bosomed earth, and hid him with his horses, before that smitten on his back by the spear of Periclymenus he had disgraced his warlike soul ;
k for in heaven-sent panics there flee even the children of the gods.
If it were possible, 0 son of Cronus, I would fain put of!
by my prayers, as long as possible, the manly1 contest for life and death, with the spears of the Carthaginian host,m and 1 entreat thee, 0 Father Zeus, long to grant to the children of the Ætneans the fortune of an orderly state, and to raise n the city to public festivities.
There are in that land, indeed, heroes that love the steed and who have souls superior to wealth.
oI have spoken a praise incredible to the low crowd ;
for the sense of honour that brings glory is secretly corrupted by gain.
Hadst thou served as shield-bearer to Chromius amongst the foot-soldiers and the cavalry, and in the con­ tests of ships, thou couldst have judged of his courage amidst the danger of the sharp fight;
since in war that goddess?
urged his warlike spirit to drive back the pest of Enyalius.
q
But few are able to counsel how with hands and soul to turn the cloud of war that is upon them upon the ranks of the enemies.
Verily for Hector it is said that glory bloomed near the streams of the Scamander ;
and upon the steep­ cliffed banks of the Helorus, where men call the place the ford of the fountain of Ares,r this light of victory looked on the son of Agesidamus in the first years of manhood.
And other deeds will I assert to have been achieved by him, on other days, many a one on the dusty land, and others on the neighbouring sea.
For from toils that are performed in youth and justly done, there ariseth to old age a life of calmness.,
Let Chromius know that he has obtained from the deities mar­ vellous bliss.
For if he should bear off honourable fame combined with many possessions, it is not possible for mortal man to attain still further with his feet to a higher eminence.
The feast for its part loves quiet;
and victory is nurtured with fostering song, ever fresh sprouting;
and near the bowl the voice of the poet is bold.
Let one mingle itt then for me, the bowl the sweet an­ nouncer of the revel, and distribute in silver goblets the mighty son of the vine, the goblets which in times past his mares having won for Chromius, brought, with the justly­ plaited u crowns of the son of Latona, from the holy Sicyon.
O Father Zeus, I pray that with the aid of the Charites I may celebrate this deed of renown of his, and that I may beyond manyv honour the victory with my praises, hurling .as I do my javelin nearest to the Muses' mark.

YE Charites, hymn the praises of the city of Danaus and his fifty bright-throned daughters, Argos, Here's dwelling-place, meet for a divinity !
With numberless praises is it enkin­ dled a by reason of its valiant deeds.
Long to tell are the deeds of Perseus concerning Medusa the Gorgon, and many are the towns which Argos founded in Egypt by the hands of Epaphus :
nor did Hypermnestra wander from the path of duty, restraining her sword solitary of purpose in its sheath.
Diomed too did the Bright-eyed Maid of the golden hair render in olden times an immortal deity;
and near Thebes the earth, cleft asunder by the bolts of Zeus, received the SOIl of Oicleus,b a stormy cloud of war.
In lovely-haired women too does Argos excel :
long ago did Zeus approaching to Alcmena and to Danae prove the truth of this assertion, and for Adrastus' sire- and for Lynceus he united the fruit of the mind with upright justice.
d And Argos nursed the spear of Amphitryon.e
He surpassing in bliss came into the kindred f of Zeus, after that clad in brazen armour he had slain the Teleboæ, and, likened to Amphitryon in form, the king of the immortals entered his hall bearing the dauntless seed of Heracles;
whose spouse in Olympus is Hebe, that walketh with her mother the presiding deity of marriage, fairest of goddesses.
M.y mouth is too small to tell the whole tale ;
to wit, how many are the blessings of which the precinct of Argos has the portion,g and the satietyh of mortals is grievous to incur;
but yet hold not thy hand, but awake the well-strung lyre and take thought of the games.
For the brazen-clad contest summons the people to behold the sacrifice of the oxen in Here's honour and the decision of the games, where Theæus, son of Ulias, conquering, twice won oblivion of the toils which he patiently endured.
He conquered too the Grecian host of yore in Pytho, and at the Isthmus and Nemea, after lie had gone thither with good luck, he won the crown;
and to the Muses be gave somewhat to till,i thrice at the gates of Ocean J having obtained the prize, and thrice on the sacred plains according to the law of Adrastus.
k 0 Father Zeus, what he desires in his soul, his mouth is silent on;
but in thee is the accomplishment and sum of all our doings :
nor, bringing as he does a bold spirit to the strife does he deprecate 1 the glory of victory by reason of a heart that shuns toil.
Known is this m to Theæus and to all who contend for the prime of the highest prizes:
n and that highest institution of Heracles Pisa has received;
yet twice have the tuneful voices of the Athenians, by way of prelude as it were to future vic­ tories, celebrated him in revel at the holy festival;
o and in.
earth burnt in fire the fruit of the olive came to the valiant people of Here in the all-variegated enclosures of jars.
PThere comes next, 0 Theæus, to the wide-known race of thy mother's ancestors the honour of success in the games q by aid of the Charites and the Tyndaridæ conjoined.r
I should claim, were I akin to Thrasyclus and Antias, not to veil the light of my eyes at Argos.
sFor with how many victories has this city of Prætus, nurse of the steed, bloomed, both in the recesses where Corinth stands,t and four times at the hands of men of Cleone!u
And from Sicyon they returned home to Argos re­ warded with silver wine-cups, and from Pellene having clad their backs with the soft woofs.

But the countless brassw it is impossible to compute ;
for to count them would be a task of longer leisure than I have;
and what Cleitor, and Tegea, and the cities of the Achæans placed on high, and the.
Lyceum near the sacred precinct of Zeus set forth for men to win, both in the foot-race and with might of hands.
Since Castor and his brother Polydeuces came as guests to Pamphaes, no marvel that it should be innate in them x to be mighty athletes;
inasmuch as they, guardian-deities of spa­ cious Sparta, preside, in conjunction with Hermes and with Heracles, over the blooming lot of the contests, making men of upright life their special care ;
for faithful of a surety is the race of the gods.
With interchange, in turn one day do they enjoy with their Father Zeus, and one do they spend beneath the depths of the earth in the delL of Therapne, filling up an equal doom :
since, when Castor perished in war, Polydeuces preferred this mode of existence rather than to be himself altogether a god and dwell in heaven.
For himY did Idas, incensed somehow concerning his herd, wound with the point of his brazen spear.
Gazing keenly after them from Taygetus, Lynceus beheld them sitting in ambush in the trunk of an oak.
For his, of all earthly men, was the most piercing eye.
With nimble feet forthwith theyz arrived and quickly wrought a bold deed;
viz., the death of Castor.
And grievous retribution the sons of Aphareus suffered at the hands of Zeus;
for immediately the son of Leda came in hot pursuit, and they over against him took their post hard by their fathers' tomb :
thence snatching a decoration of Death, a polished stone," they hurled it at the breast of Polydeuces ;
but they crushed him not, nor drove3 him back;
but rushing on straightway with spear swift in motion, he drove the brass into the sides of Lynceus.
And Zeus hurled upon Idas his smouldering thunderbolt, and they both were burnt together reft of mourners ;
for a contest with the powerful onesb is hard for men to deal with.
Speedily to his mighty brother the Son of Tyndareus returned back, and him he found not as yet dead, but with short-drawn gasp ruckling forth his breath.
0
Then shedding warm tears with groans he cried loud and clear :
—"
0 Father, son of Cronus, what end then shall there be of my sorrows !
For me also together with him ordain death, O monarch.
Honour is departed from the man that is de­ prived of his friends;
and in distress few are there of mortals faithful enough to go shares in toil"
Thus he spoke, and Zeus before him came and uttered this reply :
—"
Thou art my son;
but him engendered after thee of mor­ :
al seed did her hero husband in approach to thy mother beget.
But come ;
of these things in sooth I yet give thee choice :
if on the one hand thou art willing to escape death and hateful old age, and to inhabit Olympus in company with Athene and with Ares of the spear black with blood, there is to thee indeed a rightful share of this ;
d but if in thy brother's behalf thou contendest, and art minded to share out to him an equal lot of all thou hast, then half thy life thou must breathe beneath the earth, and half in the golden abodes of heaven.
"Thus then when he (Zeus) spoke, no wavering resolution did Polydeuces adopt in his mind.
And Zeus unclosed the eye and then let loose the voice of the brazen-belted Castor.
eInscribed to Anstagoras, son of Arcesilaus, of Tenedos:
sung at the Prytaneum in Tenedos, in commemoration of the inaugural sacrifice upon his entrance into the office of Prvtania1—10:
Proemium.
Invocation of Vesta, the tutelar goddess of the Prytaneum, in behalf of Aristagoras, now entering upon his office.
11—37 :
Praise of the success of Aristagoras in the public games of the surrounding states.
The renown of his ancestors.
37—end ;
The victor is warned against excessive pride and ambitious hopes, that might set him on aspiring to grasp at what is too high for him.
O HESTIA, child of Rhea, who art the tutelary deity of the city-halls, sister of highest Zeus and of Here who shares the tame throne, benignly receive Aristagoras into thy dwelling- place, and benignly' too his companions, near thy brilliant sceptre;
who, honouring thee, preserve Tenedos in safety, often with libations paying reverence to thee before all goddesses, and often with the steam of sacrifice.
And their lyre sounds loudly and their song, and Themis daughter of Zeusa that presides over hospitality is honoured with ever- flowing banquets.
Grant that with glory he may go through his magisterial office of twelve months' length with un­ wounded heart.
b
And for a man I pronounce his father Arcesilaus happy,c and praise his marvellous stature and his innate constancy of mind.
But if any one, possessing wealth, in beauty of form shall surpass others, and prevailing in the games bath displayed his might, let him remember that he dresses limbs that are mortal,d and that last of all he will clothe himself with earth.
Yet by the laudatory voices of his fellow-citizens is it due that he be praised, and that I should celebrate him embellished with sweet-sounding songs.
And sixteen splendid victories gained from the neigh­ bouring states crowned Aristagoras and the fortunate clan of the Peisandridæ in the wrestling-match and in the glorious pancratium.
But the too timide hopes of his parents restrained the might of their son from attempting the contests in Pytho and in Olympia.
For verily by my oath, in my opinion, at Castalia and at the hill of Cronus abounding with fair trees, had he gone thither, he would have returned more honour­ ably than his adversaries that contested the prize against him;
having celebrated with festal pomp the solemnity of Heracles that cometh every fifth year and having bound his locks with bright wreaths.
But of mortals one has empty- minded pride cast out from expected blessings, while another, distrusting over much his own strength, his spirit wanting boldness, dragging him back by the hand, has made him miss blessings that would have been his own.
It were easy, however, to conjecture the ancient Spartan blood of Peisander,f (for he Peisander came hither g from Amyclæ with Orestes, leading with him over the sea a host of the Æolians armed in brass), and to conjecture the blood descended from his maternal ancestor Melanippus mingled with the blood of Peisander at the stream of the Ismenus.
The virtues that our forefathers have bequeathed to us bring back in alternation their strength to the generations of men ;
h and in continuous routine neither do the black corn lands give forth their harvest, nor are the trees wont at every revolution of the year to bear the scented flower equal in richness;
i but in alternation are they wont to bear.
And in this wise does destiny guide the mortal race.
As to what shall befall us from Zeus, no sure presage attends men, whereby they may foreknow the decrees of Pro­ vidence ;
but still we indulge bold designs, and are eagerly bent on many schemes ;
for the limbs of man are bound by insatiate hope,j but the courses of human actions and of future events lie far remote from our forethought.
It behoves us to hunt after the due proportion of gain ;
k but the madness for objects of desire, not to be obtained, is very keen.
ISTHMIAN GAMES (῎Ισθμια), one of the four great national festivals of the Greeks.
This festival derived its name from the Corinthian isthmus, where it was held.
Where the isthmus is narrowest, between the coast of the Saronic gulf and the western foot of the Œnean hills, was the temple of Poseidon, and near it was a theatre and a stadium, of white marble.
The entrance to the temple was adorned with an avenue of statues of the victors in the Isthmian games, and with groves of pine-trees.
These games were said originally to have been instituted by Sisyphus in honour of Melicertes, who was also called Palæmon.
Their original mode of celebration partook, as Plutarch remarks, more of the character of mysteries, than of a great and national assembly, with its various amusements, and was performed at night.
Subsequent to the age of Theseus, the Isthmia were celebrated in honour of Poseidon;
and this innovation is ascribed to Theseus himself, who, accord­ ing to some legends, was a son of Poseidon, and who, in the institution of the new Isthmian solemnities, is said to have imitated Heracles, the founder of the Olympian games.
The celebration of the Isthmia was henceforth con­ ducted by the Corinthians, but Theseus had reserved for his Athenians some honourable distinctions;
those Athenians who attended the Isthmia sailed across the Saronic gulf in a sacred vessel (θεωρις), and an honorary place (προεδρία) as large as the sail of their vessel was assigned to them during the celebration of the games.
In times of war between the two states, a sacred truce was concluded, and the Athenians were invited to attend at the solemnities.
The Eleans did not take part in the games, and various stories were related to account for this singular circumstance.
It is a very probable conjecture of Wachsmuth, that the Isthmia, after the changes ascribed to Theseus, were merely a panegyris of the Ionians of Peloponnesus and those of Attica;
for it should be observed, that Posei­ don was an Ionian deity, whose worship appears originally to have been unknown to the Dorians.
During the reign of the Cypselids at Corinth, the celebration of the Isthmian games was suspended for seventy years:
but after this time they gradually rose to the rank of a national festival of all the Greeks.
In Olympiad 49 they became periodical, and were menceforth celebrated regularly every third year, twice in every Olympiad, that is, in the first and third year of every Olympiad.
The Isthmia held in the first year of an Olympiad fell in the Corinthian month Panemus (the Attic Hecatombæon);
and those which were held in the third year of an Olympiad, fell either in the month of Munychion or Thargelion.
Pliny and Solinus erroneously state that the Isthmia were celebrated every fifth year.
With this regularity the solemnities continued to be held by the Greeks down to a very late period.
In 228 B. c. the Romans were allowed the privilege of taking part in the Isthmia ;
and it was in this solemnity, that, in 196 B.c., Flaminius proclaimed before an innumerable assembly the i tide­ pendence of Greece.
After the fall of Corinth in 146 B.C., the Sicyonians were honoured with the privilege of con­ ducting the Isthmian games;
but when the town of Corinth as rebuilt by Julius Cæsar, the right of conducting the solemnities was restored to the Corinthians, and it seems that they henceforth continued to be celebrated, till Christianity became the state religion of the Roman empire.
The season of the Isthmian solemnities was like that of all the great national festivals, distinguished by general rejoicings and feasting.
The contests and games of the Isthmia were the same as those at Olympia, and embraced all the varieties of athletic performances, such as wrestling, the pancratium, together with horse and chariot-racing.
Musical and poetical per­ formances were likewise carried on, and in the latter women were also allowed to take part, as we must infer from Plutarch;
who, on the authority of Polemo, states, that in the treasury in Sicyon there was a golden book which had been presented to it by Aristomache, the poetess, after she had gained the victory at the Isthmia.
At a late period of the Roman empire, the character of the games at the Isthmia appears greatly altered;
for, in the letter of the Emperor Julian, it is stated that the Corinthians purchased bears and panthers for the purpose of exhibiting their fights at the Isthmia;
and it is not improbable that the custom of intro­ ducing fights of animals on this occasion commenced soon after the time of Cæsar.
The prize of a victor in the Isthmian games consisted at first of a garland of pine-leaves, and after­ wards of a wreath of ivy ;
but in the end the ivy was again superseded by a pine-garland.
Simple as such a reward was, a victor in the games gained the greatest distinction and honour among his countrymen;
and a victory not only rendered the individual who obtained it a subject of admira­ tion, but shed lustre over his family, and the whole town or community to which he belonged.
Hence, Solon established by a law, that eveiy Athenian who gained the victory at the Isthmian games, should receive from the public treasury a reward of one hundred drachmae.
His victory was gene­ rally celebrated in lofty odes, called Epinikia, or triumphal odes, of which we still possess some beautiful specimen among the poems of PindarInscribed to Herodotus, son of Asopodorus, of Thebes, victorious in the chariot-rase at the Isthmian games, perhaps in 01. 80, 3. B.C. 454.
Written and sung at Thebes, probably some short time, according to Dissen's conjecture, before the battles of Tanagra and CEnophyta, B.C. 457 and 456.1—13:
Proemium.
The poet affirms that he has laid aside a Pæan which he was about to compose for the people of Ceos, that he might first finish this hymn in honour of the renown won by his native country.
14—32 :
The Castoreum, or Equestrian strain, in honour of Herodotus'victory in the four-horse car.
32—40 :
The vicissitudes of fortune, exile and subsequent restoration to his country, experienced by Asopodorus, the father of the conqueror.
41—end :
The praises and victories of Herodotus.
THEBE, with shield of gold, my mother, I will hold thy con­ cern superior even to want of leisure.
a Let not rocky Delos, in which I am absorbed, be angry with me !
What is dearer to the virtuous than cherished parents ?
Yield, 0 isle of Apollo ;
of both hymnsb will I, with the favour of the gods, combine the completion, celebrating in chorus both Phœbus with unshorn hair, in wave-washed Ceos along with the men of the ocean, and the sea-fenced ridge of the Isthmus:
since it has granted to the host of Cadmus six crowns from the games, the glory of noble victory to my native country.
That country in which too Alcmena brought forth her dauntless son, before whom of yore the bold hounds of Geryon shook with dread.
,But I composing for Herodotus a reward partly for his four-horse car, and as guiding too the reins with no other hands than his own, am desirous to enrol him either in a Castoreum, or in a hymn such as is sung in honour of Iolaus.
For of all the heroic race they were born the best to guide the car at Lacedæmon and at Thebes, and in the games they tried numerous contests, and with tripods did they adorn their home, and with caldrons and with bowls of gold, enjoy­ ing crowns of victory :
and brilliantly does their excellence shine forth both in the unarmed stadia, and in the armed race-course clattering with the shield ;
and in what fashion, hurling them with their hands, did they throw with their spears, and how did they throw whenever they hurled with the stony quoits !
For the five-fold contest was not yet;
but for each game a separate prize was appointed, with the numerous wreaths of which having ofttimes bound their locks, they were seen near the streams of Dirce and the Eurotas ;
they, the son of Iphicles being of the same people with the race of the Sown-men, and the son of Tyndarus dwelling amongst the Achæans in the lofty-placed seat of Therapne.
Farewell!
and I, for Poseidon, and for the divine Isthmus, and for the shores of Onchestus cherishing a song, will amidst the honours of this man sing of the renowned fortune of his father Asopodorus and the paternal soil of Orchome­ nus, which in chill mishap received him from the immeasur­ able sea, hard pressed with shipwreck;
but now again the good fortune of his race has brought hill into his former honour and glory.
But he that has endured adversity, gains in his mind discretion too.
But if virtue is applied with all its zeal, to those who have attained to its honour both by liberality and industry, it is right to bring a noble praise with no envious mind.
cSince light is the gift for the poet, in return for manifold toils, by singing a. strain of praise, to rear a trophy of glory common to all.
For various rewards proposed for their works are pleasing to various men, both to the shepherd, and to the ploughman, and to the fowler, and to him to whom the sea gives support;
and each one exerts himself to ward off direful hunger from his stomach.
But he who in games, or inBut us it behoves, gratefully requiting turn with a song, loudly to celebrate the earth-shaking son of Uranus, dwelling nearat hand, him that prospers the chariots in the horse-race,d and to invoke thy sons, 0 Amphitryon, and the recess of Minyas,e and Eleusis the far-famed grove of Demeter, and Eubœa in the crooked courses ;
f and thy sacred precinct in Phylace amongst the Achæans, 0 Protesilaus, do I add.
But to enumerate at length all the honours that Hermes, president of the games, has given to the horses of Herodotus, my song having brief measure denies -to me.
Dften too, of a surety, does that which is passed over in si­ lence bring greater pleasure.
Would that he, borne aloft on the splendid pinions of the sweet-voiced Pierides, may yet fill his hand full with branchesg from Pytho, and with chosen leaves of the Olympic games from the banks of the Alpheus, getting honour for seven-gated Thebes !
But if any one storeth up within secret wealth, and laughs with insulting taunt at others who act differently, he does not consider that he will yield his soul to Hades devoid of glory.
Written to celebrate the Isthmian victory in the chariot-race.
and other victories gained by Xenocrates, son of Ænesidamus, and brother to Thero of Agrigentum ;
sent to Thrasybulus, son of Xenocrates, after his father's death, by Nicasippus.
The victory was gained O)1. 76, 1. B.C. 476 ;
but the ode composed not before 01. 77, 1. B.C. 474.1—2 :
Proemium.
The Muse has now to work for hire ;
the poet therefore begs that Thrasybulus, the son of the now deceased con­ queror, will excuse the delay that had occurred in fulfilling his promise to send this ode.
12—34 :
The victories in the chariot-race at the Isthmian, Pythian, and Athenian games won by Xenocrates, and the victory of There (the brother of Xenocrates), at the Olympian games.
35—end:
The virtues of Xenocrates :
the poet ends by begging Thrasybulus not to fail, through fear of envy, to have this ode recited.
THE men of ancient time, 0 Thrasybulus, who ascended into the car of the Muses with-frontlet-of-gold, falling into the company of a the famous lyre, lightly uttered melodious hymns in praise of youths, namely for him whoever being gifted with beauty possessed the summer-bloom of puberty, the sweetest reminder of fair-enthroned Aphrodite.
For the Muse was not at that time as yet a lover of gain nor a hire­ ling, nor were sweet, soft-voiced songs, with silver in their faces,b sold by honey-toned Terpsichore.
But now she (the Muse) bids us observe or attend to the saying of the Argive (Aristodemus) that approacheth very near the paths of truth ;
“ Money, money isc the man," and this he said when deserted both of wealth and of friends.
Since now thou art wise I need add no more, and therefore I pass on and sing the Isthmian victory not unknown to fame, won by the chariot steeds;
the victory which Poseidon having granted to Xenocrates, sent him by the hands of his charioteer a wreath of Dorian parsley to bind around his hair;
Poseidon, I say, honouring the hero victorious in the chariot-race, the light of the Agrigentines.
And at Crisa widely-potent Apollo beheld him with favour and granted him glory there also ;
and being furnished withd the illus­ trious honours of the Erechtheidæ in brilliant Athens, he blamed not the chariot-preserving hand of the hero that drove the steeds, which hand Nicomachus applied at the right moment to all the reins.
Nicomachus whom too the heralds of the seasons,e the Elean announcers of the truce of Zeus the son of Cronus, recognized;
having experienced from him, I ween, some hospitable office, and they saluted him with sweetly-breathing voice as he fell into the lap of golden victory in their own land, which in truth they call the sacred precinct of Olympian Zeus;
where the sons of Ænesidamus were united to immortal honours.
For your house, 0 Thrasybulus, is not unacquainted with charming triumphal revels, nor with songs of honied praise.
For it is no hill, nor is the path steep,!
if any one should bring the honours of the Dwellers on Helicon to the abodes of honoured men.
Hurling the quoit afar, may I fling it as great a length, as Xenocrates has possessed a disposition sweet beyond other men!
g Dignified indeed he was in his intercourse with his fellow-citizens, and one that cultivated the rearing of the steed according to the rule of universal Greece ;
and he wel­ comedh all the feasts of the gods ;
nor did the fair-wind of bounty, breathing around his hospitable table, ever make him lower his sail,!
but he passed in his course to the Phasis in the summer season, and in the winter to the banks of Nile.
j
Let not Thrasybulus therefore, because envious feelingsk hang round the minds of mortals, let him not, I say, conceall the worth of his father, nor these my hymns :
since I have not wrought them to stand idle.
This message, Nicasippus, report, when thou shalt have come to my trusty friend.
Inscribed to Melissus, son of Telesias, of Thebes, victorious in the chariot-race at Nemea, and afterwards in the pancratium at the Isthmian games ;
the latter of which victories is the one here celebrated :
sung at Thebes, at an evening revel, Dissen thinks, of the family of the Cleonymidæ (Cf. v. 61), probably some years after the battle of Platæa (Cf. v. 34, 35), which was fought in B.C. 479.1—6 :
Proemium.
Wealth and success is lasting when conjoined with a modest and temperate spirit.
7—18 :
Melissus has won two victories, one in the pancratium, one in the chariot-race.
The poet commemorates the latter, and the relationship of the conqueror to the wealthy house of the Labdacidæ.
19—60 :
The praises of the Cleonymidæ, the family of the conqueror ;
their vicissitudes of fortune ;
the death of four of their house in the recent battle (probably of Platæa), and their subsequent successes in the public games.
61—end :
The Isthmian victory of Melissus ;
his former victories in the games celebrated at the funeral rites of the sons of Heracles.
IF any man being successful either in glorious games or in abundance of wealth, sets bounds in his soul to wearisome insolence, he is worthy to be mingled with a the praises of the citizens.
O Zeus, from thee mighty excellences attend mortals, and the bliss of the religious flourishes longer, but with froward minds, it dwells not equally, blooming throughout all time.
But as a requital for glorious deeds we ought to sing the good, and we ought to exalt him with kindly praises,b as he celebrates the festal meeting.
Melissus also has the fortune of two prizes so as to turn his heart to sweet gladness, as he has obtained the crowns in the dells of the Isthmus;
and also in the hollow vale of the deep-chested lion he proclaimed Theba,c conquering, as he did, in the horse-race.
And he disgraces not the innate prowess of his lineage.
Ye know, surely, the ancient glory of Cleonymus gained by the car ;
and since by the mother's side they were kindred to the Labdacidæ, they abounded with wealth for the toils of the four-horsed chariots.
But time, as the days go round, produces at one time one change, and at one time another, yet the sons of the gods assuredly alone are invulnerable.
I have, by the grace of the gods, an endless path open to me in every direction, 0 Melissus :
for, at the Isthmia, thou hast furnished me with facilities to follow up your virtues with a hymn:
d those virtues with which the Cleonymidæ ever bloom abundantly, as they pass, with the aid of heaven, through the whole period of man's life.
But variously at various times does the gale of human fortune burst upon and urge on in their career all men.
Theye assuredly are said to have been honoured of yore at Thebes, and to have been the public hosts of the neighbouring states, and free from noisy insolence ;
and whatever poetic testimonies of exceeding glory related concerning deceased or living heroes fly to and fro amongst men, these they have gained in all perfection;
and in the highest acts of manhood displayed by their family they have reached the pillars of Heracles.
Desire not to attain to a further glory!
For they were both trainers of the steed, and they pleased brazen Ares.
But, alas!
in one day a fierce snow-storm of war bereaved the happy household hearth of four heroes;
but now again, after the wintry darkness of the changing months, like the earth it has blossomed with purple roses, by the counsels of the gods.'
Since the Shaker of the earth, who inhabits Onchestus and the ocean bridge before the walls of Corinth, by granting to the family of Melissus this wondrous hymn, raises from its couch the ancient fame of their noble deeds;
for sheg had fallen asleep;
but wakened up again she is resplendent in her whole frame, like Lucifer conspicuous amongst the other stars.
Which fame in the fields of Athens too, having pro­ claimed that their chariot won, and in the Adrastean con­ tests of Sicyon, gave them wreaths of triumphal song similar to these from the poets of that time.
Nor from the common assemblies did they withhold their curved chariot, and they rejoiced to contend with all the assembled Greeks in the expense for the equipment of their steeds.
For to those who make no venture belongs inglorious obscurity.
But ob­ scurity of lot belongs even to those who contend, before that they have arrived at the highest boundary ;
h for fortune gives us both of this and of that;
i and the artifice of inferior men has caught and supplanted the better man.j
Ye know no doubt the murderous strength of Ajax, which in the late night having maimed with his own sword, he causes disgrace to the children of the Greeks, as many as went to Troy.k
But Homer has honoured him among all men, Homer who, by extolling all his merit and greatness, has pointed it out for bards of after times to sing according to the canon of divine epic verse.
For thism travels on, endowed with speech to all eternity.
But if a poet shall have celebrated aught well, then both over the all-fruitful earth and across the ocean doth there proceed the splendour of the noble actions that he sings of, ever inextinguishable.
May we find the Muses propitious so as to light up that torch of hymns for Melissus too, a scion of the stock of Telesias—a wreath deserved of the Pancratium !
For re­ sembling them in courage, he attains in the contest to the spirit of loudly-roaring lions;
but in craft he is a fox, which lying upon its back withstands the swoop of the eagle.
And it is befitting, by trying every stratagem, to render powerless one's foe.
For he has not obtained a stature like Orion's, but is contemptible to view, though mighty in strength for one to contend with.
But yet in like fa hion there came of yore from Cadmean Thebes to the dwelling of Antæus, a hero short in stature, but in soul unconquerable;
he came, I say, to wheat-bearing Libya to wrestle with a foe, in order that he might restrain the man that roofed the temple of Poseidon with the sculls of strangers ;
—he came, I say, the son of Alcmena ;
Who ascended to Olympus, after that he had explored both every land and the surface of the hoary sea with-lofty- cliffs, and had rendered the sea safe to navigation.
And now by the Ægis-bearer doth he dwell, enjoying the fairest bliss, and is honoured by the immortals as a friend, and has Hebe in marriage, being lord of a golden mansion, and son-in-law of Here.
In whose honour, above the Electran gates, we citizens, making ready the banquet and the fresh garlands of the altars, sacrifice victims in honour of the eight deceased brass­ clad warriors, whom Megara, the daughter of Creon, bore to him as sons ;
to whom, at the setting of the sun, the flame ascending on high lasts blazing all night long, lashing heaven with the steaming vapour;
and on the second day succeeds the prize,, of the annual games, the work of strength.
Where, with his head crowned with the pale myrtle,o this man has displayed a double victory, and a third before amongst the youths, having obeyed the exceedingly wise advice of his pilot that directed the helm.
P
And along with Orseas will I celebrate him in the revel, dropping upon him sweet praise.
Inscribed to Phylacidas, son of Lampo, of Ægina, victorious in the pancratium at the Isthmian games :
probably in 01. 75, 3. B.C. 478, two years after the battle of Salamis (Cf. v. 49):
sung at Ægina.1—11 :
Proemium.
Invocation and power of Theia (also called Chryse), the goddess of wealth.
12—19 :
Praise of the three victories won by Phylacidas, and of the one won by his brother Pytheas.
19—53 :
The praises of the achievements in war of Ægina, the mythical deeds of the Æacidæ at Troy, and the lately-won glory of the Æginetan fleet at Salamis.
54—end :
The poet returns to the praises of the victories in the games wo :
by the conqueror's family, and especially by Pytheas.
O THEIA, mother of the sun, worshipped under many titles, through thee it is that men esteem potent gold far beyond all other things;
for ships contending in the ocean and horses in the chariots are through thy favour, 0 queen, admired, in the quick-whirling encounters.
And in the contests of the games he too bath gained much-desired glory, whose locks numerous crowns have wreathed, vic­ torious either by might of hands or by swiftness of feet.
For the strength of man is proved distinguished through the favour of Providence.
But two things in truth alone cherish the most lovely flower of life conjoined with fair-blooming wealth, to wit, if any one, being blessed with success, hear himself well spoken of.a
Seek not to become Zeus :
thou hast everything, if the inheritance of these blessings come to thee :
a mortal lot befitteth mortals.
Now for thee at the Isthmus, a double victory in all its splendour, 0 Phylacidas, is laid up in store;
and at Nemea a victory in the pancratium is laid up as a treasure for you both, for thee, I say, and for Pytheas thy brother.
But without the Æacidæ my heart tastes not the sweets of hymns, but with the Charites I have come, in this my ode, to the sons of Lampon, to this well-ordered state :
and since itb has turned itself to the illustrious path of heaven-prompted deeds, grudge her not, 0 my soul, the befitting praise to mingle with this song.
in return for the toils she has undergone.
For the valiant warriors among her heroes are wont to gain praise, and they are celebrated to endless time both on the lyres and with the many-toned harmonies of the pipe.
The mighty Œneidæ too, held in revered honour through the grace of Zeus in the brilliant sacrifices of the Ætolians, have given a theme to wise men,c and in Thebes the steed- driving Iolaus hath honour, and Perseus in Argos, and the warlike might of Castor and of Polydeuces at the streams of the Eurotas.
But in Œnoned are honoured the stout-hearted tempers of Æacus and his sons;
who too in battle twice sacked the city of the Trojans, following in the train of Heracles, the first time, and afterwards with the Atreidæ.
Proceed, now, I pray thee, from the beginning.
Say, who slew Cycnus, who Hector, and who the fearless captain of the host of the Ethiopians, Memnon, clad in brass ?
Who, pray, smote with his spear the valiant Telephus beside the banks of the Caicus ?
It was they whose mouth proclaims the glorious isle of Ægina as their country.e
And of old has Ægina been built on high, as a tower for lofty virtues to climb :
f full many shafts of praise does my eloquent tongue possess to utter loudly concerning them.
And so now in time of war can Salamis, city of Ajax, testify that she bath been preserved by her sailors in the deathful shower of Zeus during the hail-storm slaughter of countless heroes.
But for all that, steeps boasting in silence:
h
Zeus dispenses various fortune, Zeus, who is lord of all.
But even such glories as thesei love the joyful hymn of victory, bedewed with charm­ ing honey.
Let any one contend with all his toil for prizes in the games, after that he has heard of the race of Cleonicus the ling toil of these heroes has not been obscured, nor, as many as have been their expenses, has that either im­ pairedk the zeal of their expectations.
1I praise Pytheas too, for that with limb-conqueringm arms, he went a straight course forn Phylacidas in the course of blows,o an adversary, in skill expert.
Receive for him a crown, and for him bear the woolly fillet, and send therewith the new winged hymn.
Inscribed to the same person ( Phylacidas of Ægina) as the last ode, in honour of a victory in the pancratium at the Isthmian games.
This ode is prior in time to the foregoing one (but later than Nemea V.), and was composed undoubtedly before the battle of Salamis, and sung at Ægina at a banquet in the house of Lampo, the victor's father.
1—16 :
Proemium.
The poet expresses his hope that he may hereafter be able to compose a third ode, this being the second (and Nemean V. the first), in honour of the sons of Lampo, for a future Olympian victory;
and Lampo's prayers for the attainment of this wish, he begs the Fates to hear and grant.
19—56 :
Mythical portion of the ode.
The glory of the Æacidæ, Peleus, Telamon, and Ajax:
the tale of Heracles' prayer to Zeus, that Telamon might have a valiant and invulnerable son.

The poet returns to the subject of the ode, the praises of the victor, of Pytheas his brother, of Euthy­ menes his uncle, and of Lampo his father, who had so successfully trained his two sons for their contests in the games.
As when at the rich banqueta the second cup is mixed, so we mingle the second cup of the strains of poesy for the race of Lampon that hath been successful in the contest, having first received from thee, O Zeus, in Nemea, the prime of crowns;
now again from the Lord of the Isthmus and from the fifty Nereids, Phylacidas the youngest of his sons being victori­ ous.
And may it be allowed us, offering a third cup to the Olympian Saviour, to honour Ægina with honied songs as with a drink-offering.
For if any one rejoicing in expense and in labour per­ forms noble deeds that the gods build up,b and at the same time Providence brings about for him lovely glory, that man, I say, already casts anchor at the extremest bounds of hap­ piness, honoured as he is of the gods.
The son of Cleonicus prays, that having obtained c such desires, he may receive death and hoary old age ;
and I invoke the lofty-throned Clotho and her sister Fates to follow the noble demandsd of a man that is my friend.
And you, 0 Æacidæ of the golden cars, you I say it is my clearest law to besprinkle with praises, as often as I approach this island.e
But innumerable paths, a hundred feet in width, of noble deeds, have been cut uninterruptedly even beyond the fountains of the Nile, and through the Hyperboreans ;
f nor is there any state so barbarous or so strange in tongue, that hears not of the glory of the hero Peleus, the blessed son- in-law of the gods ;
nor is there one which hears not of the glory of Ajax, the son of Telamon, and of his father;
whom, along with the Tirynthians, as a zealous ally, the son of Alcmena led on board his ships to war that-delighteth-in- the-brazen-arms against Troy, the heroes' toil, on account of the offences of Laomedon.
And heg took Pergamia,h and along with him he slew the nation of the Meropes, and the herdsman Alcyoneus, huge as a mountain, after that he had found him at Phlegræ, nor did Heracles spare with his hands his own deep-twanging bowstring.
But ere all this befel as he summoned the son of Æacus to the expedition, he chanced to find them all feasting.
The warlike son, then, of Amphitryon as he stood there in lion’s skin, did noblest Telamon call upon by name to make com­ mencement with nectarean libations,i and he held up and gave to him the goblet that held the wine, rough with gold.
He then having stretched up to heaven his undonquered hands, uttered such words as these :
—
“If ever, O Father Zeus, thou hast heard my prayer will propitious mind, now, I pray thee, now, with most earnest prayers do I implore of thee a bold son by Eribcea for this hero, so as to perfect the happiness of my friend watched over by the Fates;
and him (the son) strong in body, even as this hide now envelopes me about, belonging to the beast which first of all my toils I slew of yore in Nemea.
And let courage correspond with his stout frame.
”Immediately as he said these words, the deity sent forth to him the sovereign of birds, the mighty eagle ;
and sweet delight thrilled him within.
And he said, speaking like a prophet :
“
There shall be to thee the son that thou askest, O Telamon."
And him, named after the bird that had appeared, he called the very mighty Ajax, marvellous in after times in the warlike toils of men.
Thus then having spoken he forthwith sat down.
But for me it were tedious to re­ count all his valiant deeds.
For I have come, 0 Muse, the dispenser of triumphal hymns for Phylacidas, and for Pytheas, and for Euthymenes.
After the Argive fashion shall it be said somehow in briefest terms.
For three victories in the Pancratium from the Isth­ mus, and others from leafy Nemea, did the illustrious sons and uncle bear off:
and what a copious measure of hymns have they brought to light;
and the tribe of Psalychidæ do they besprinkle with the fairest dew of the Charites, and having exalted the house of Themistius they inhabit this highly-favoured cityJ
And Lampo giving zealous heed to the labours of training for the games greatly approves this saying of Hesiod, and pointing it out to his sons, exhorts them to observe it, bringing as he does a common glory to his city;
and he is loved for his kindness towards his guests, endeavouring to pursue k moderation in thought, and at ainiug tol moderation in deed also.
And his tongue is not at vari­ ance with his thoughts :
thou wouldest say that he is to Athletes what the Naxian brass-sharpening whetstone is amongst other stones.
I will give them the pure water of Dirce to drink,- which the deep-girded daughters of Mne­ mosyne with robe of gold have caused to gush forth near the well-walled gates of Cadmus.
Inscribed to Strepsiades, a Theban, victor in the pancratium, perhaps in 01.
81,1. B.C. 456, six months after the battle of (Enophyta, when the Thebans were defeated, and lost their supremacy over Bœotia :
sung at Thebes.1—19 :
Proemium.
The ancient and mythical glories of Thebes.
20—39 :
Praise of the recent victory of Strepsiades, and of the glorious death of his uncle of the same name.
39—end :
The poet exhorts his fellow-citizens to moderation in time of prosperity, and warns them against striving after what is beyond their reach, and out of their power to effect.
WITH which of thy former native glories, 0 blessed Theba, hast thou most specially delighted thy soul ?
Was it when thou broughtest to light the assessor of timbrilled Demeter, Dionysus of the floating locks?
or was it when, receiving at the mid hour of night the mightiest of the gods snowing with gold, what time, standing within the doors of Amphi­ tryon, he approached his wife with Heraclean seed ?
or was it when thou didst rejoice at the sage counsels of Tiresias ?
or when in Iolaus skilled in the steed ?
or in the seed of the dragon's teeth who are unwearied at the spear ?
or was it when, from the fierce battle, thou didst send back Adrastus bereft of innumerable companions to equestrian Argos ?
or when thou placedst on firm basea the Dorian colony of the Lacedæmonians, and the Ægidæ thy descendants took Amyclæ, through the Pythian oracles ?
But yet the remembrance of ancient glory is wont to sleep in oblivion, and mortals are forgetful of that which does not reach to the highest prime of poetry, yoked to the far-famed streams of verse.
Sing then in honour of Strepsiades too with a sweet- sounding hymn.
For he bears away at the Isthmus the victory of the pancratium;
and in strength he is wondrous, and goodly in shape to behold, and he displays a valour that does not shame his stature.
b
And he has a blaze of glory from the violet-tressed Muses, and to his maternal uncle of the same name he has given a wreath to share—his uncle to whom Ares of the brazen shield brought death, but honour is laid up as a reward for the valiant.
For let him surely know, whoever in this cloud of war repels in behalf of his beloved country the hailstorm of blood, turning the plague against the host of his foes, let him know, I say, that for the race of his citizens he increases their glory to the greatest height, both while he lives, and when he is dead.
And thou, son of Diodotus, emulating the warlike Meleager, and emulating Hector too, and Amphiaraus, hast breathed forth thy blooming age in the crowd of the foremost combatants, where the bravest sustained the strife of war in the extremity of hope.
And I endured an inexpressible grief;
but now the Earth-encompasser has granted me calm after a storm.
T will sing, having bound my locks with wreaths.
And let not the envy of the immortals disquiet the daily pleasure.
in pursuit of which I tranquilly approach old age, and the destined period of life.
For we die alike all of us ;
but our fortune is unequal.
But if a man gazes around after what is distant, he is too weak to attain to the seat of the gods with floor of brass ;
since the winged Pegasus threw his master Bellerophon, who desired to go to the mansions of heaven to the assembly of Zeus;
for the bitterest end awaits the pleasure that is contrary to right.
But to us.
O thou that bloomest with the golden hair, O Loxias, grant at Pytho too a blooming crown at thy contests.
Inscribed to Oleander of Ægina, son of Telesarchus, victorious in the pancratium at the Isthmian and Nemeau games :
written a few monthe after the battle of Platæa, 01. 75, 2,—B.C. 479 :
sung at Ægina.
Boeckh thinks that the ode must have been written shortly after the taking of Thebes by the allied Greeks, and therefore that it comme­ morates a Nemean, and not an Isthmian victory.
1—15 :
Proemium.
The poet, though anxious and fearful of some new disaster after the close, it would seem, of the Persian war, when the Thebans feared the vengeance of the allied Greeks for their late Medizing, yet rouses himself to sing the victories of Oleander.
15—60 :
The mythical portion of the ode, commencing with the mythical con­ nection of Thebes and Ægina.
Pindar passes on to the fame of Æacus as an arbitrator in disputes and quarrels;
to the Æacidæ, distin­ guished for valour and for justice ;
to the tale of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, whose hand was sought by Zeus and Poseidon ;
and to the valiant deeds of Achilles at Troy.
61—end:
The poet returns to the immediate subject of his ode, the victories in the games of Nicocles, the late uncle of the conqueror, and the present victory of Oleander.
FOR Oleander and his youthful prime let some one, 0 ye youths, going to the splendid vestibule of his father Te­ lesarchus, raise the festal song, the glorious recompense of his toils, the reward both of his Isthmian victory, and because that, in Nemea, he gained the victory in the contest.
For whom I too, though grieved in soul, am bidden to invoke the golden Muse.
But since we have been freed from mighty woes, let us neither fall into a lack of crowns, nor do thou, my spirit, cherish thy woes;
but having ceased from unprofitable griefs, let us sportively utter abroad some sweet strain even after our calamity :
since some deity hath turned aside from us the stone of Tantalus that was hung over our head, insufferable toil to Greece.
But the passing away of my fear has put an end to my grievous anxiety, and it is better always to look to what is present.
For deceitful time hanga over men, rolling life's stream along ;
but even these evils3 re capable of a remedy to mortals, if only they have liberty;
ind a man should cherish good hope.
And it is the duty of one that hath been reared in seven- gated Thebes to allot to Ægina before all else the choicest gift of the Charites, because that from their sire were born twin daughters, the youngest of the daughters of Asopus, and they pleased Zeus lord of all.
Who near Dirce of the fair stream gave one to dwell as mistress of the city that loves the car ;
b and having brought thee, 0 Ægina, to the island Œnopia, he lay with thee;
where to his loud-thundering sire thou didst bring forth divine Æacus the most wise of all the dwellers upon earth, who used to bring to an end the strifes even of the gods:
his godlike sons and his warlike sons’ sons excelled by their courage in conducting the din of brazen mournful war, and they were temperate-minded and sage of soul.
This did the assemblies of the blessed ones remember, when Zeus and bright Poseidon strove for the nuptial tie of Thetis, either of them desiring that she should be his fair bride ;
for love possessed them.
But the immortal understandings of the other gods accom­ plished not for them that wedlock, when they heard the voice of the oracles.
For Themis, author of wise counsel, said amongst them all, that it was fated that the ocean goddess should bring forth for himc a lordly son more mighty than his sire, who should wield in his hand another weapon more powerful than the thunderbolt and the irresistible trident, if she were united to Zeus or to the brothers of Zeus.—“
But do you then cease this strife, and let her, having obtained a mortal spouse, behold her son slain in war, like to Ares in might, and in strength of feet like lightning.
It is my advice to give her as the honour of wedlock granted-by-the­ gods to Peleus, son of Æacus, who is by report the most pious of men that the plain of Iolcos contains.
And let the tidings go straightway to the immortal cave of Chiron, nor let the daughter of Nereus twice put into our hands the leaves of contention ;
d but in the evening hours when the moon is at the full let her loosen the lonely zone of her virginity to the hero.
”Thus spoke the goddess addressing the sons of Cronus, and they with their immortal eyebrows nodded assent, and the fruit of her words did not fall away and perish.
For they say that along with them king Peleus had regard for the espousal of Thetis.
And soon did the mouths of the wise point out to the ignorant the youthful valour of Achilles ;
who both stained with blood the vine-clad Mysian plain, sprinkling it with the black blood of Telephus, and bridged a return home for the Atridæ, and redeemed Helen, having cut with his spear the nerves of Troy (which in times past checked him as he marshalled on the plain the work of homicidal battle), both the haughty might of Memnon and Hector and other princes, to whom Achilles, warder of the Æacidæ, disclosing the dwelling of Persephone,c showed forth Ægina and his own descent.
To him, not even when dead, have songs been lacking, but near his funeral pyre and tomb did the Heliconian maidens stand, and over him pour forth the dirge with many a strain.
This then was thought befitting by the immortals, to consign a valiant hero, evei when passed away, to the hymns of the goddesses.
And this course now too is proper ;
f and the car of the Muses hastens on loudly to sing the memorial of the boxer Nicocles.
Honour him, therefore, who in the Isthmian game lilts won the Doric parsley, since surely in times past he too overcame the heroes who dwelt around him, driving them before him with a hand that none could escape.
Him the offspring of his renowned uncles does not disgrace :
let one of his compeers weave a beauteous crown of myrtle for Oleander in honour of his victory in the pancratium ;
since him did the lists of Alcathous, and the youth assembled in Epidaurus, formerly receive when he came in success and triumph.
Him to praise is easy for the good ;
for he did not in concealment wasteh a youth unacquainted with noble deeds.

The Index which I have compiled to the passages of Pindar referred to in J elf's Greek Grammar will prove of great use to the reader.
It is a matter to me of much regret that the whole of the foregoing translation had, already, not only been written, but also printed, before the second edition of Jelf appeared.
Other errata, besides those noticed, have no doubt escaped my eye, for which I beg the reader to accept the excuse of my having had to work in the midst of many other occupations and numerous interruptions.

That more than Nature's self her painted dreams delight.

Great son of Tantalus, thy fate Not as the fablers I relate.

Her Pelops lost, her vanish'd son Soon roused the frantic mother's care;

But soon from ill-digested greatness sprung Presumption and abuse :

A ponderous rock High o'er his head hung threatening (angry Jove So judged him for his crimes above) :
Where day and night he waits, dreading th' expected shock.

The waves

The Genius, thus, whose power upholds
The prosperous destiny of Theron's race, And sends them wealth from heaven, a scene unfolds, In times long past, of vengeance and disgrace- Vengeance from that ill-omen'd hour When son and sire in foul encounter met;
And all, that Pythian threat denounced of yore, In Laïus'* murder mix'd, consistent and complete.
Quick the sharp-eyed Fury flew, And, as the strife she stirr'd, apace Kindred their warlike kindred slew ;
Social bloodshed thinn'd the race.
Poly nicest bit the ground ;
Sole Thersander lived, renowned

Sprung from that old heroic sire, CEnesidamus bids us raise Th' applauding lay, and sweep the lyre Through all its thrilling chords in Theron's praise.
’Midst Olympia's shouting bands

With fourfold team in rapid race
Twelve times he scour'd the circling space :
Before Success the Sorrows fly.
And Wealth more bright with Virtue joined, Brings golden Opportunity, The sparkling star, the sun-beam of mankind ;
Brings to the rich man's restless heart Ambition's splendid cares, t No less he knows
The day fast comes when all men must depart, And pay for present pride in future woes.
The deeds that frantic mortals do In this disorder'd nook of Jove's domain, All meet their meed ;
and there's a Judge below Whose hateful doom inflicts th' inevitable pain.
O'er the Good* soft suns the while Through the mild day, the night serene, Alike with cloudless lustre smile, Tempering all the tranquil scene.
Theirs is leisure;

No ills they know, no tears they shed, But with the glorious Godst below Ages of peace contented share.
Meanwhile the Bad with bitterest woe Eye-startling tasks, and endless tortures wear.
All, whose stedfast virtue thrice Each side the graved unchanged hath stood Still unseduced, unstain'd with vice, They by Jove's mysterious road Pass to Saturn's realm of rest,§ Happy isle that holds the blest;

Or goodly tree profusely pours ;
Whence pluck they many a fragrant band, And braid their locks with never-fading flowers.

Hector he, the pillar of Troy By mightiest arms unmov'd, o’erthrew, And bright Aurora's Æthiop ¶ boy :
He the godlike Cycnus slew­
On my quiver'd arm I bear Many an arrow swift and rare ;
Dealt to the wise delight they bring, To vulgar ears unmeaning ring.
Genius his stores from nature draws ;
In words not wit the learned shine ;
Clamorous in vain, like croaking* daws, They rail against the bird of Jove divine.
Heed not thou their envious tongue, Straight to the mark advance thy bow ;
t Whither, brave spirit, shall thy song
Throw the shaft of glory now ?
Lo it flies, by Justice sent, Full at famous Agrigent ;
While truth inspires me thus to swear, That Time shall waste his hundredth year Ere race or realm a King shall raise, Whose liberal heart, whose loaded hand Shall paragon with Theron's praise, Or strew, like his, its blessings through the land..
Yet e'en his virtues to assail Hath headstrong Envy spurr'd Injustice* forth, Plotting with hostile arm, and slanderous tale, To hide in mischief's shade the lamp of worth.
But, if the numberer toils in vain To count the sands t that heap the wave-worn beach;
The joys, the graces of his bounteous reign
What memory can record ?
What soaring song can reach ?
To please the bright-hair'd Helen, ‡ and the Twins Of Tyndarus, gods of hospitable love, With Agrigent's renown my boast begins ;
While wreaths for Theron from th' Olympian grove, Borne by th' unwearied steeds away, I twine.
For this beside me stood Th' inspiring Muse, and to the Dorian mood Tuned for her glorious choir my new-embellished lay.
Those high-toss'd heads, with glittering* chaplets bound Challenge my spirit to this task divine, The shrill-toned pipe, the varying lyre to sound
In full concordance to the swelling line, Which thus, Ænesidamus, t throws
On thy brave son its mingled praise- Applauding Pisa too demands my lays, Whence many a heav'n-taught hymn for conquering cham­ pions flows:
Champions, whose brows th' Ætolian ‡ seer, That gives th' Herculean mandates old, The Game's unerring arbiter, Bids Victory's graceful prize enfold :
He round their locks the silvery olive § flings;
Whose leaves of yore Amphitryon's || son, To frame Olympia's matchless crown, From freezing regions brought, and Ister's ¶ shadowy springs..
He th' Hyperborean tribes* and chieftains wild, That bend the knee before Apollo's shrine, Peaceful besought;
and with persuasion mild, To form his Sire's capacious grove divine, The conqueror's wreath, the stranger's shade, † Won the fair plant:
for on the plain Jove's altar smoked, and from her golden wain The Moon ‡ with rounded orb, Eve's radiant eye displayed.
Then too, the pure Tribunal to preside
At his Great Games, the proud Quinquennial* Feast 'Stablish'd had he by Alpheus' sacred tide :
Yet not, as now, then waved the Cronian waste With woods umbrageous ;
but on high, When Pelops held his ruder reign, The dazzling sun-beam smote th' unsheltered plain;
'Twas then the tracts he sought, that skirt th' Arctoic sky.
Him there Latona's huntress-child From fair Arcadia's vales received, Deep winding vales and mountains wild ;
t
What time by stern Eurystheus ‡ grieved Necessity, that bound his Sire in heaven, Task'd him in that bleak waste to find The golden-horn'd and sacred hind,§ To chaste Orthosia's shrine by fair Atlantis given.
Bent on the search, beyond where Boreas brew'd
His wintry blast, the wondrous realm he found, Their groves with fond desire admiring view'd,
And thence, his Hippodrome's twelve-circled round To shade, th' adopted plant removed.
Still with the godlike Twins,* of yore Whom Leda's ample zone prolific bore, Oft to that feast he comes, and cheers the toils he loved.
Them, when the Hero mounted to the spheres, To guard his Games, where might for mastery strives With might, and skill the raging chariot steers, He charged :
to them my soul for Theron gives
The glory of the dazzling prize :
Them, lords and lovers of the race, Th' Emmeniant Tribe salutes, their favouring grace With costliest banquets won, and frequent sacrifice.
Such their rewards, whose customs most, Whose hearts the Gods in reverence hold.
As water still is Nature's boast, And all Earth's treasures yield to gold, ‡ Theron hath reached the limitary main, And touch'd with virtues all his own, Th' Herculean pillars* of renown, Wit's, Folly'a farthest bound, where song pursues in vain.
O THOU, that drive'st ‡ in clouds above Th' impetuous thunder, mighty Jove !
Me with my lyre and varying strain
Thy circling Hours § have sent again
Their tuneful witness, to proclaim
The glories of thy matchless Game.
At Virtue's weal the just rejoice, and bless
The tidings of a friend's success.
But thou, Saturnian King, that dost display Through Ætna's range thy partial sway ;
Beneath whose huge* tempestuous cone
The hundred heads of Typhon groan, 0 hear th' advancing choirt prolong, Moved by the Graces, their triumphal song:
'Tis Virtue's lamp, whose living rays, Wide as her rule, for ever blaze ;
Lo where it beams in Psaumis' car‡
That bears th' Olympian braid from far, In haste the blooming glory now To bind on Camarina's brow.
Heaven speed his future vows, as now my lays
With note sincere his virtues praise.
His boast to rear, to rule the panting steed :
All guests his plenteous banquets feed ;
While with pure heart he wooes the hand
Of genial Peace to bless the land.
Ne'er shall untruth these lips profane ;
Trial's the only test, that proves the mailThis from the Lemnian * dames' abuse Redeem'd the son of Clymenus :
At his grey locks their taunts they played ;
But when in brazen arms † array'd
Th' incumber'd race with ease he won,
And calmly claimed th' unquestioned crown, To much abashed Hypsipylè, " Ev'n me “ First of the swift, behold," said he, “ Nor less in strength and prowess :
age's snow “
On youth's fair front will sometimes grow ;
“
But he, that does the deeds of manhood's prime, “ May without blame look old before his time.
”THE flower of all the Olympian boughs, That bind exalted Virtue's brows, Take, Camarina,* with delight;
Take, shining Daughter of the Sea, What the swift mules,† the chariot bright, The conquering Psaumis brings to thee.
Destin'd thy peopled state to raise
He, at the Gods' high Festival, On ‡ six joint hearths his offering lays, While incense fumes and victims fall.
There five bright days, renown to gain, Skill, Bravery, Strength, the strife maintain :
There yoked or mounted, * mule and steed Through all the swift career Contest the panting prize of speed.
Thee Acron's son † proclaiming there, Hath proudly given to everlasting fame
His country's rising towers, his Sire's ennobled name.
Returned from that delightful plain Œnomaüs’ once and Pelops' reign,‡ Minerva's § shrine, whose fostering power Guards his young state, he hallows now, Oänus’ || stream and many a bower
That shades the glittering lake below;
Hallows the banks and solemn clifts, Where Hipparis' || wholesome waters rove, Laving his peopled realm.
He lifts
The pillar'd pile, the marble grove, Whereon his princely chambers rise
In swelling domes, that crown the skies.
Thus his rude tribes, untrain'd, unform'd
He rears to life and light:
For Toil and Wealth by Virtue warm'd Ever with Difficulty fight;
While Enterprise no threatening danger scares, And all-adored Success the palm of Wisdom wears.
O
Thou, that dwell'st in clouds above The Cronian Mount, Preserver* Jove, Whose favour still pursues the wave That wandering Alpheus pours along, Still beams on Ida's t awful cave, To thee thy suppliant rears his song ;
In Lydian strain implores thy grace Long on this rising realm to wait, And send a sound adventurous race To guard and signalize their state.
Thee, too, by victory taught to breed And cherish the Neptunian steed, Thee, Psaumis, grant the indulgent Power A calm old age to bear, And meet unmoved the parting hour, With all thy children standing near.
If Wealth and Worth and Happiness and Fame.
Be thine, among the Gods seek not t' inscribe thy name.
PILLARS of gold our portal to sustain, As for some proud and princely Place, We'll rear :
the founder of the strain With far-refulgent front his opening work should grace.
And if there be, who boasts th' Olympian braid, L Whose priestly* lips prophetic truths diffuse At Jove’s Pissean altar;
one, whose aid Hath helped to t raise illustrious Syracuse ;
Where are the high-wrought hymns, the glowing lays
His country's lavish love shall swell not with his praise 1Know, son of So stratus, that Heaven hath made This sandal for thy foot divine.‡
Virtue, by peril unassay'd, On land or tranquil wave in honour ne'er can shine.
Th’ adventurous deed a thousand hearts record.
To thee the praise, Agesias, all shall yield, On Œcleus’ son Amphiaraüs* pour d By just Adrastus in the fatal field, When in Earth's yawning gulph th' astounded seer Sunk with his snorting steeds, chariot and charioteer.
῎Τwas there, when round th' heroic dead Sev'n Theban pyres were seen to burn, Sorrowing the son of Talaüs* said, " The eye of all my host I mourn :
"
His searching soul the future knew;
" His spear controul'd the raging fray”—
Such is the Syracusian too, The master of my lay.
Nor brawl, nor paradox I love ;
I hate with cavillers to contend;
But this my surest oath I've pledged to prove
And the mellifluous Muse her lasting aid shall lend.
Bring forth thy mules, 0 Phintist and behind
In haste the glittering harness join, With me thy chariot mount and find Along yon spacious road the cradle of his line.
Full well, I ween, th' illustrious track they know, Learnt from the plaudits of th' Olympian throng
That crown'd their necks with glory.
Open throw To their careering speed the gates of song.
To-day we press for Pitana,* and lave Ere night our burning team in cool Eurotas' wave.
Fair Pitana, † by Neptune's amorous prayer Press’d, as they tell, her charms to yield, The violet-tress'd Evadnè‡ bare.
She in her anxious breast the virgin pang concealed Till, past the painful hour, a trusty train Charged with the pledge of her cselestial love To Æpytus § she sent, who ruled the plain, Where Alpheus' waves by famed Phæsana || rove.
There nurtured, with Apollo tasted she The tempting fruit that grows on Love's forbidden tree.
Escaped not long the guardian King
Her altering form, the stolen embrace :
Rage and regret his bosom wring ;
Where, burying still th' unknown disgrace, Forthwith the Delphian Fane he sought.
Meanwhile to shadiest covert lone
Her silver urn the damsel brought;
There loosed her purple zone, And bore the godlike babe unseen Fill'd with the spirit of his Sire ;
Who with his golden locks and graceful mien Tli' assistant Fates* had won, and soothed Eleutho’s† ire.
Forth from her arms with short and grateful throe Came Iämus to light:
her child On th' Earth she left overwhelmed with woe:
Him there two Serpent forms with eyes of azure mild, Mysterious ministers of love divine, Fed with the baneless beverage of the bee :
‡
When now from rocky Pytho’s§ warning shrine
In haste the King return'd, and earnestly From all his questioned household 'gan require Evadnè’s new-born son,—“ For Phœbus is his sire," Destined before all mortals to prevail "
The peerless prophet of mankind;
" Whose race, whose name shall never fail."
Thus represented he :
they with one voice combined
All vow'd their ignorance :
nor sight had seen,
Nor infant sound had heard :
for he five days 'Mong shrubs and pathless briars and rushes green Had lain, the dewy violet's mingled rays || Sprinkling with purple and gold his tender frame • Whence fond Evadnè’s joy proclaimed his deathless name.
*Now when fresh youth its golden flower Full o'er his blooming cheeks had strew'd, Alone at night's tempestuous hour † In Alpheus' midmost stream he stood.
He call'd his grandsire Neptune's name, Wide Ruler of the boisterous deep ;
Call'd on that Archer‡ God whose flame Beams on the Delian steep ;
For patriot fame he pour'd his prayer Beneath the vault of heav'n :
"
My son," Replied his Sire's unerring speech, " repair To yon frequented tract, my Word shall lead thee on.
"Forthwith they stood on Cronium's topmost stone, High as the sun's meridian road ;
§ There paused the God, and on his son
The rich and twofold boon of prophecy || bestow'd :
Gave him to hear the voice that cannot lie ;
Bade him, when Hercules* in after-days, Flower of the great Alcæan progeny, His Sire's frequented Festival should raise And proud Olympian Game, by gift divine On Jove's high altar plant his oracle and shrine.
Thence through all Greece the seed of Iämus Bright Honour followed;
in its train Came potent Wealth;
the virtuous thus To Fame's conspicuous path by action proved attain.
Yet envious hearts there are no worth can warm ;
Which e'en the chariot-crown with rancour fills 'Gainst modest Merit;
o'er whose brightening form Victory her own ingenuous grace distils.
If yet, Agesias, thy maternal race, Whose affluent dwellings rose by old Cyllenè’s † base,Have knelt at Mercury's‡ sacred shrine
The swift-wing'd herald of the skies, With soothing prayers and gifts divine ;
(He guards the games, allots the prize, And loves Arcadia's youth);
'twas he, Aided by thundering Jove's regard, Gave, son of Sostratus, to thee Thy conquest and reward-
A prompting power, methinks, I feel A sharpening whetstone on my tongue ;
*
That stirs my flowing numbers to reveal Our old Arcadian root, and leads the willing song.
'
Twas fair Metope's† love, Stymphalian spouse, To Thebes equestrian Thebè gave ;
In whose sweet fount, for warriors' brows Weaving the various hymn, my tuneful lips I lave.
Rise, Ænĕas,* and enjoin thy swelling choirs To sing Partheniant Juno, then declare, If the stale stigma that belied our Sires, (Bœotian boars,‡ forsooth)!
we still shall bear.
Thou art Truth's harbinger, the Muse's tongue, Her mystic § staff, the cup that pours her potent songBid them remember Syracuse, and sing Of proud Ortygia’s throne, secure In Hiero's rule, her upright king.
With frequent prayer he serves and worshie pure
The rosy-sandal’d Ceres,* and her fair Daughter, whose car the milk-white † steeds impel, And Jove, whose might th' Ætnæan t fires declare.
The lay, the sweet-toned lyre his praises tell ;
Time, mar not his success ! with welcome sweet Agesias’ choral pomp his liberal smile shall greet.
Lo from Arcadia'a parent seat, Her old Stymphalian walls, they come, From fields with flocks o’erspread, to meet Sicilia's swains, from home to home.
O'er the swift prow, when night-storms lour, Two anchors oft 'tis well to cast-
Heav'n on them both its blessings pour, And bid their glories last.
Lord of the main !
direct aright, With toils unvex'd their prosperous way ;
Spouse of the golden-wanded Amphitrite,§ With lovelier hues enrich the flowers that crown my lay.
As one, whose wealthy hands enfold
The sparkling cupt of massy gold Froth'd‡ with the vineyard's purple tide, His Banquet's grace, his Treasure's pride, Presents it to the youthful spouse Pledged in full draught from house to house ;
And thus affection's honours fondly paid, While on the soft connubial hour Encircling friends their blessings pour, Gives to his envied arms the coy consenting maid.
Thus to the Youth, whose conquering brow Th' Olympian wears or Pythian bough, Lord of his hope, inspired I pay The tribute of my liquid lay, The nectar || of the Muse's bowl, Press'd from the clusters of the soul.
Blest they, whose deeds applauding wordls admire !
For them, as each her glance pt. takes.
The life-enlightening Grace* awakes
The various vocal flute, the sweet melodious lyre.
To-day the lyre and flute and song, Roused by Diagoras,t I move, Hymning fair Rhode‡ from Venus sprung, The Sun's own Nymph § and watery love :
With her the giant boxer's praise to sound, The champion's noblest hire, By Alpheus' stream,* Castalia's fountain crown'd;
And Damagete his old and upright Sire, Pride of the beauteous Isle, whose Argive† host By Asia's beaked‡ shore three § Sovereign Cities boast.
Fain would my lay their legends trace, Divine A lcides' powerful race From old Tlepolemus, || and prove Their boasted Sire's descent from Jove, Amyntor's fair Astydamè
The root of their maternal tree.
But o'er men's hearts unnumber'd errors hang ;
Nor can dim Reason's glimmering show The flowery path untrod by woe, Or find the day's delight, that brings no morrow's pang.
*For ev'n the founder chief, t that plann'd
The fortunes of this prosperous land, With olive club by rage impell'd, Alcmena's spurious brother fell'd:
Midst Tiryns' walls by Midea's side
In her own porch Licymnius died.
Alas!
not Wisdom's self has power to quell
The furious passions, when they meet To tear her from her judgment-seat!
Distracted at the deed he sought the Delphian cell.
Apollo waved his golden locks, And warn'd him from his fragrant fane, Forthwith to steer from Lerna's‡ rocks
For the rich realm amidst the main, Where erst with golden shower imperial Jove Bedew'd the wondering town ;
What time his brazen axe* stout Vulcan drove, And Pallas from the Thunderer's rifted crown With outcry loud and long impetuous broke ;
Heaven shuddered, and old Earth t with dread maternal shook.
'
Twas then Hyperion's son‡‡ divine, Lamp of the world, his Rhodian line In haste enjoin'd with duteous eye To watch th' expected prodigy ;
That first of mortal votaries they Their shining altar might display, Jove and the Virgin § of the Thundering Spear
The first with solemn rites to soothe.
Precaution thus the paths of Truth To Virtue's footstep shows, and cheers her rough career.
Yet oft before the wariest eyes Mists of forgetfulness arise, And unexpectedly betray The wandering purpose from its way.
'Twas thus, the seeds* of fire forgot,†
Their high-built shrine the Rhodians sought, With unburnt offerings heap'd;
yet showers of gold Jove pour'd‡ upon them from the cloud;
And Pallas' self their hands endow'd
With more than mortal skill her rarest works to mould.
Spread far and wide their various praise :
In all mysterious crafts they shone, Strew'd o'er their walls, their public ways, The sculptured life, the breathing stone.
§ Twas Genius strengthen'd by the toils of Art.
Yet once, as stories say, When Jove Earth's ample field to part ’Mongst all the gods decreed, the Lord of Day Above the waves saw not the Rhodian steep, By fate still bound within the dungeon of the deep.
Absent on function high the lot Of the bright Sun his peers forgot;
And he the purest of the skies Shared not the rich terrestrial prize.
Warn'd of the wrong, high Jove again
The partial lots proposed, in vain;
" For that mine eye discerns," the Sun replied, " A region gathering from the ground, . “ For man's delight all planted round “With fruits and pastures fair beneath the foaming tide.
"Forthwith commanded he to rise
The golden-vested Lachesis,* With lifted hand† and fatal nod To give the sanction of a god, Join'd with Saturnian Jove, and swear, When time that shoal to heav'n should rear, ts realm his boon should be.
The pledge divine On Truth's unfailing pinion flew ;
Promise to Consummation grew ;
p sprung the beauteous isle and budded from the brine.
His blooming lot the genial Sire, That frames the pointed beams of day, That rules the steeds whose breath is fire, Received.
There oft with Rhode he lay ;
Till seven brave sons with matchless wisdom fraught, Their fruitful raptures crown'd.
The first Iälysus begot,* And Lindus, and Cameirus :
they, their bound Paternal into three partitions thrown, Each chose his several realm, and named it for his ov n.Tlepolemus,t whose high command Once led the brave Tirynthian band, There, as a god, due honours knows, The rich rewards of all his woes, Victims on fuming altars slain, Umpires and Games to grace the plain.
There twice the stout Diagoras was crown'd ;
Four times from Isthmian ‡ lists he bore
The mantling wreath, and many more From Nemea's crowded grove and rough Athene's moundHim Argos with her brazen shield*
Endow'd him fair Arcadia's field ;
† Him The es, and all the heroic games
Which old Bœotia's custom claims ;
Ægina him her champion shows ;
Him six times crown'd Pellenè knows, And Megara's stone, o'erblazon'd with his praise.
0 thou, that rear'st thy temple bleak On Atabyrium's‡ topmost peak, Great Jove, with favour hear our loud triumphal lays.
Raise thou the man, whose arm hath found Renown in famed Olympia's vale;
Bid citizens his deeds resound, Strangers his name with reverence hail.
Just, like his upright sires, unblamed he walks
His unpresumptuous way.
Hide not his race from good Callianax,§ His tribe Eratian tell:
for him to-day The whole state feasts-but in a moment's change
To every point the gusts of public favour range.[
ODE VIII.
OLYMPIA, mother of the Games, Where Worth his golden chaplet claims;
Mistress of Truth ;
* whose fate-exploring Priest From the slain victim t learns, if highest Jove, Whose hand the dazzling thunder throws, Views with regard the dauntless breast, That, fired with Virtue's noblest love, Pants but for Fame and Victory's sweet repose.
Such blazon gracious Heaven allows To prophets' pure and pious vows.
But thou, Pisæan Grove, whose branches wave O'er Alpheus' stream, accept the wreaths I bear, Triumphal strains.
A deathless name
Thy glorious guerdon gives the brave.
Not all the same distinctions share :
Various the paths divine, that lead to fame.
You, valiant youths, kind Destiny sonsign'd To Jove your natal genius :
he thy name, Timosthenes,* proclaim'd in Nemea's Game, While Pisa's wreaths Alcimedon entwined :
Of beauty's manliest mould was he ;
Nor fail'd his act the warrant of his face ;
Crown'd with the Wrestler's victory Ægina's isle t he named his native place :
Where all to Themis‡ bow, that sits above, Saviour at once and judge, by Hospitable Jove,No where so reverenced.
Hard it is
Where interests clash and contests rise To meet th' occasion, yet with judgment pure
The scales of right sustain.
By Heav'n's decree
That sea-girt isle thus proudly stands (Still strengthening Time its weal secure), Like some blest column in the sea, T' invite and guide all strangers from all lands;
§Still ruling with her Dorian line
The realm of Æacus * divine :
Whom fair Latona's son with Neptune pair'd, Toiling round Troy to rear the towering wall, Leagued in hee work :
her fatal hour By that portentous choice declared, That her proud domes in fight should fall, And hostile fires her smouldering fanes devour.
Scarce perfect was the pile, when up the tower
Three azure serpents leapt;
and from the side
Two, as with horror thrill'd, recoil'd and died :
Yelling the third rush'd on with gathered power-
The portent strange Apollo views, And pondering briefly thus :
" Devoted Troy, " Thy help, ill-omen'd Hero, rues ;
"
Thy mortal work her empire shall destroy :
"
Yet not without thy sons ;
† for 'tis decreed "
The first and fourth of thine must mingle in that deed"
Thus Saturn's seed, the thundering Jove “ In vision shows me from above."
That warning given, Xanthus* in haste he reach'd, The mounted Amazons† and Ister's stream Survey'd.
Tow'rds Isthmus by the main
As swift the Trident-bearer stretch'd;
But first he stay'd his golden team, While Æacus regain'd Ægina's plain.
Thence o'er proud Corinth, to inspect Her glorious Feast, § his chariot check'd.
Not all with equal favour all things see :
His beardless rivals conquered should my string Sound for Meilesias,|| Envy's hand Fling not the pointed stone ¶ at me;
For I his Nemean Feats will sing, And rough Pancratian fray with men maintain'd.
With ease from Wisdom's lips instruction flows ;
Which unprepared fools only will dispense ;
For weak's the wit of Inexperience.
Perfect beyond his peers Meilesias knows Th' Athletic discipline and plan, That, when the Game shall rouse him to the fray, Harden and frame the practised man, To bear th' adored and dangerous prize away.
To-day his boast Alcimedon must be, The thirtieth youth his art hath train'd for victory.
He with the smiles of Fortune bright, Nor wanting valour's manliest might, Hath to four hapless youths* victorious doom'd
Th' hateful return, the path obscure, the tale
Of shame ;
and in his grand sire's heart Youth's long-extinguish'd lamp relumed :
When Glory's cheering beams prevail, Old age revives, and death forgets his dart.
Now let the loud-recording lay Awaken Memory to display
What feats, what triumphs in the manual war The Blepsiant tribe achieved—Gain'd from the Games On their proud busts six chaplets bloom.
Their kindred's rite the dead shall share :
Its praise departed Virtue claims :
The trump of Glory echoes in the tomb.
‡From Fame, the child of Hermes,* Iphion Heard ere he died, and shall delighted tell Callimachus th' Olympian Crown that fell By Jove's good gift to his distinguish'd son.
Still may the god his blessings shower
On their fair deeds, and chase disease away ;
Nor Nemesis t send with vengeful power
To thwart the promise of their prosperous day.
Grant them long life, to Fortune's ills unknown, Their country's weal enhance, and crown it with their own.
ARCHILOCHUS’* resounding strain
The victor's ancient lay,t thrice chanted loud, Sufficed along th' Olympian plain By Cronium's mount ‡ to lead th' exulting crowd, The friends by Epharmostus' side
That swell'd the full triumphal tide.§
But from the distant-dealing bow To-day 'tis thine the shaft to throw,.
The Muse's shaft, that mounts above E'en to the purple-bolted Jove And Elis' sacred Promontory;
Whose realm, Œnomaüs’ power o’erthrown, Pelops t the Lydian hero won, Hippodamia's fairest dowry.
Send now thy sweet, thy winged reed, At Pytho's field :
‡ the bard, whose thrilling string Resounds the manly wrestler's deed From glorious Opus,§ stoops not on the wing,|| No vulgar flight pursues, the praise Of Opus and her son to raise :
Where Themis and her child sedate, Eunomia,|| famed, preserve the state.
On Alpheus' banks her glories gleam
And bloom by pure Castalia's stream ;
From whence by minstrels pluck'd the flower?
Of all their blended chaplets grace
The mother of the Locrian race,* Midst her deep woods and waving bowers.
Thus while her favour'd City glows
With the full radiance of my lay, Swifter than generous steed, or bark that throws
Her swelling wings along the watery way, I'll spread the tale through every land, If bless'd by Heav'n this tuneful hand Cultures the Graces' choicest field ;
For they all mortal transports yield, And wit and valour wait on their divine command.
By them inspired Alcides† dared With club terrestrial brave the Trident's might;
What time the Pylian towers to guard Neptune his rage withstood.
The Lord of Light Advanced his silver-sounding bow, And warr'd against th' heroic foe.
Nor e'en in Hades' rueful hand Unbrandish'd hung th' infernal wand, Wherewith men's mortal forms are led To th' hollow city of the dead—‡
Renounce, my lips, the verse profane!
'Tis hateful wit at gods to rail :
Vain-glory's impious ill-timed tale Sounds but of Phrenzy's thoughtless strain.
Babble no more of themes like these, Nor mix with fabled war th' immortal Powers :
Sing rather thou with blameless lays Protogeneia's* ancient towers ;
Where by Jove's best in thunder heard Man's first abode Deucalion rear'd, When from Parnassus' glittering crown t With Pyrrha‡ pair'd the Seer came down.
Behind them rose their unborn sons,
The new-named laity of stones, A homogeneous mortal throng :
For them thy sounding numbers raise, Nor, when old wine* inflames thy praise, Forget the flowers of modern song.
Then, as they tell, a deluge raged
O'er the sunk Earth's opacous plain :
Till Jove's rebuke the wasteful waves assuaged, And pent them in their oozy gulf again.
Sprung from that aged ancestor
Your brazen-buckler'd sires of yore, (Blood, that from old Iäpetus runs And dames † that mix'd with Saturn's sons)
A line of genuine kings their native sceptre bore ;
E'er since th' Olympian* Leader's love Snatch'd Opus’ daughter from th' Epeian plain To dark Mænalia's† conscious grove, And gave her back to Locrus' arms again ;
Lest age, that hastes our mortal doom, Should bear him childless to the tomb.
By that celestial Power compress'd A nobler birth the matron bless'd.
The good old Hero hails beguiled And doats upon th' imputed child ;
And gives him, as his years display Youth's comeliest form and manhood's fire, The name, that graced his mother's sire, To boast, a peopled realm to sway.
Strangers unnumber’d round his throne, Argives, and Thebans, and Arcadians press'd, Pisatians too ;
but Actor's son Menætius most his high regard caress'd, Patroclus' sire :
on Mysia's plain
He with th' Atridæ leagued in vain, When Telephus ‡ the Grecian throng Back on their barks disorder'd flung, Alone with great Achilles stay'd :
Heroes his act with shouts survey'd :
And Thetis' son, his brave compeer Implored him from that glorious day No more to meet the martial fray Apart from his all-conquering spear.0 !
for a spirit* that could bid New words and quickening thoughts to rise, Of skill the Muse's daring car to guide
In all the might of genius through the skies!
Then would I come with glory's bay, While Fame and Friendship fired my lay, To grace the brothers' Isthmian crown, The prize Lampromachust had won, The twin achievement proud of one victorious day.
Where Corinth's portal* parts the main
Two triumphs more brave Epharmostus gain'd ;
Others on Nemea's shelter'd plain :
t
He from th' Athenian youths ‡ the prize obtain'd;
From men th' Argolic shield § he won :
Oh !
what a strife at Marathon, || With beardless foes no longer pair'd, 'Gainst sturdier age the stripling dared !
Himself unfoil'd with dexterous bound He writhed and whirl'd them to the ground.
Graced with the goblet's silver meed
What shouts, what plaudits from the throng Cheer'd, as the champion stalk'd along, His manly port, his manlier deed.
At Jove's Lycæan Feast* the whole Parrhasian host marv’lling his might survey'd ;
Marvell'd Pellenè,† when the Stole, Winters warm antidote, his bulk display'd.
Witness the tomb, where Thebans grace The Games of godlike Iölas;
‡ Witness Eleusis'§ wave-born strand
The toils and triumphs of his hand.
From Nature * all perfections flow :
And though from task'd attention slov Taught excellence will sometimes strain
And struggle to renown;
if Heav'n Has not th' inspiring impulse given, 'Tis silence best rewards the pain.
Life's walks are various :
one concern
The crowded world can ne'er sustain:
To Fames high path the steps of Genius turn.
Thy gift aloud proclaim ;
in daring strain Tell, how of birth propitious sprung Th' Oïlean Gamest robust and young With dexterous arm and dauntless eye
Thy champion braved, and Victory With all his glorious wreaths the shrine of Ajax hung.
WHERE stands Archestratus' triumphant son, Th' Olympic victor, ‡ written on my mind ?
My promise of sweet song for him design'd
Had from my faithless memory flown.
But thou, 0 Muse, from whom no treachery springs, And Truth, fair daughter of high Jove, Lend me your upright efforts to remove
The slur that Slander on mine honour flings.
'Tis true the distant dilatory day Hath brought to shame the debtor and the debt:
With amplest usury he'll discharge it yet, And melt the keen reproach away.
Mark how the strong wave, as it sweeps along, Rolls the wash'd pebble from the shore ;
Mark how th' arrear shall vanish as we pour Friendship's full tribute, our historic song.
For Truth with the Zephyrian Locrians * dwells :
They love th' heroic Muse and martial field.
Cycnust with onset fierce, as story tells, Th' o'erpowering might of Hercules repell'd.
As by Achilles roused Patroclus ‡ stood ;
So to stout Has on th' Olympian sand The boxer's palm Agesidamus owed.
Oft bath the cheering friend, when Nature's hand Has touch'd the warrior's heart with Virtue's flame, Gigantic deeds inspired, and Heav'n confirm'd his fame.
Conquests by toil unearn'd to few belong:
Action's the sovereign good, the light of life.
But me Jove's Hallow'd Rites the athletic strife
And matchless Games in solemn song Bid blazon ;
which the potent Hercules Stablish'd by Pelops' ancient tomb ;
What time the godlike Cteatus* to his doom He sent, though sprung from him that rules the seas,Him with bold Eurytus, the largess due Thus from reluctant Augeas to compel.
Them on their journey in Cleonse'st dell Th' avenging chief from ambush slew.
Just retribution !
his Tirynthian host, ‡ Surprised in Elis' close defiles, Molionè’s o’erweening sons by wiles Had crush'd;
and all his choicest chiefs § were lost.
That guest-beguiling king the wrath of Heaven Soon reach'd.
He saw the sceptre of his sway, To sword and flame his wealth and country given, Saw his Epeian* kingdom pass away, Sunk in Destruction's gulf!
'Tis hard indeed

That justice satisfied, the son of Jove Muster'd his conquering bands and massy spoils On Pisa's plain, the fruits of all their toils.
To his great Sire the sacred Grove He compass'd out;
and in clear space within Paled all the sever'd Altist round ;
For the free banquet smooth'd the circled ground ;
And crown'd Alpheius' banks with many a shrineTo the twelve Sovereign Gods.*
Yon bordering peak The Cronian Mount he call'd, a nameless waste When old Ænomaüs reign'd, by song ungraced, And drench'd with snows its turrets bleak.
To that prime consecration and high rite The Fates t in stern attendance came ;
And Time, whose sole probation can proclaim Truth to be true, that season stay'd his flight.
He i i his course advancing to this hour Bears record where the Hero's altars rose ;
The gifts of war how portion'd he, the flower Of all the spoils he gain'd from all his foes;
How solemnized his great Quinquennial Feast.
Say now, what envied youth the new-wrought crown Earn'd in that first Olympiad, from the crest
Of his foil'd foe plucking his fresh renown ?
Who quell'd his rival in the manual war.
Flew on the bounding foot, or whirl'd the madding car.
Æonus first, Licymnius’ * youthful son,
Who ruled in Midea’s t walls his native force, With speed unmatch'd along the Stadian course
The light pedestrian chaplet won.

Dear, as the smiling infant, which the wife
Almost past hope to its fond father bears Now far declined into the vale of years, And warms with love his waning life.
For who, that with long thrift and honest toil
His patrimonial store bath swell'd, Loathes not in childless age his gains to yield, And leave strange heirs to riot on the spoil ?
So who with name unsung* from Gle ry's fray, Agesidamus, sinks to Death's domain, The slave of thankless care hath breathed in vain.
And flung life's rapturous hour away.
For thee the sweet voice of the warbling lyre, The soft mellifluous flutes diffuse
Their mixt harmonious graces.
Fame pursues Where Jove's Pierian Maids the strain inspire.
By them inflamed have I with earnest praise Th' illustrious Locrians crown'd;

In beauty's flower his manly form excell'd, Where Youth o'er Strength diffused her early charm ;
Such Youth as erst by winning Cypria ‡ led Relentless death repell'd from blooming Ganymede.
SOMETIMES we need the breathing gale, Sometimes the soft celestial rain, Child of the cloud, † to bless the vale ;

To those, that win th' Olympian prize Such lavish eulogies belong ;
And such my willing tongue supplies :
For aye the flowers of genius bloom, when Heav'n inspires the song.
Son of Archestratus, thy proud renown, (Agesidamus hear !) thy olive's golden crown,Won by thy matchless hand shall share
The sweet melodious lay, The Western Locrians* all my care :
There, Muses, join the festal choir, for they Chase not, I ween, the stranger from their shore, Nor live unlearn'd in Glory's lore.
Science and warlike enterprise are theirs :
The Fox, the raging Lion, every creature Unchanged its inborn instinct bears, Leaves not the cast of Nature.
DAUGHTER of Eleutherian Jove, ‡ Protecting Fortune, to thy power I pray To guard imperial Himera :
§ Guided by thee || the winged gallies move Through the wide sea :

Th' approaching day's event, mysterious Heaven Hath not to helpless mortals given ;
And all is blind tow'rds dim futurity.*

Son of Philenor,t thy renown Had shed its faded flower, Thy speed beyond thy native bower, Like the brave cock's ‡ domestic wars, unknown:
Had not, Ergoteles, the civil fray, That friend with friend embroils, Forced thee from Cnossian fields § away;
Now in th' Olympic grove for nobler toils, By Isthmians once, and twice in Pytho crown'd, A worthier hearth thy Fame has found By the warm waves of Himera, Whose Nymphs by thee ennobled hail thy stay.
WHILE to the House thrice in Olyinpia* crown'd, The citizen's indulgent friend, The stranger's host, my praise I send ;
Thee, prosperous Corinth, t for thy race renown'd, Portal of Isthmian Neptune, ‡ shall my strain Forget not.
There the Golden Sisters reign From Themis sprung,* Eunomia pure Safe Justice and congenial Peace, Basis of states;
whose counsels sure With wealth and wisdom bless the world's increase,And Insolence the child of bold-tongued Pride Far from the social haunt repel.
Many a fair tale have I to tell, Which fearless Truth forbids ray song to hide, If aught could hide what Nature's grace bestows.
Sons of the famed Aletes, † round your brows

”Thus in mid night with gleaming Ægis graced, The Virgin hail’d him as he slept :
Roused on his feet at once he leapt
To clutch the glittering wonder, which in haste To Polyide* the neighbouring Seer he brought, And told th' event his foresight sage had taught;
"
How while he dreamt the wondrous dream “
Couch'd on her shrine, the daughter chaste "
Of Jove, whose spear's the lightning’s beam, " Herself the potent gold beside him laid.
"Paused not the Prophet, but with press'd advice Urged him the vision to obey;

Forth sprung the stout Bellerophon, Stretch'd on his mouth the thrilling charm, And made the winged fugitive his own,And leapt in brazen arms array'd
On his proud back and with his fury play'd.

|But while direct the lance of song we send, What boots it from the tuneful string Far from the mark our shafts to fling ?
For to the tribe of Oligæthe ‡ a friend With all the bright-throned Muses, Nemean plain And Isthmian shore I'll visit with my strain.
A word the copious tale shall tell Pledged on mine oath :
the Herald's tongue Hath at those games with cheering swell Full sixty glorious times their triumph rung.
Their past Olympic feats have graced my song;
The future in their joyous day, Hope's promise, shall the Muse display :
But fortunes and events to heaven belong.
Smile but their natal genius from above, The rest to Mars we'll trust, and ruling Jove.
Yet must I name their Pythian boughs, Their wreaths from Thebes,* from Argos brought:
And Jove's Lycæan altar knows
Their countless wonders in Arcadia wrought:
Pellenè too, and Sicyon, And Megara, and illustrious Marathon, Eleusis, and the fenced Grove Of Æacus, and Eubcea's Isle, And all the prosperous states, above Whose walls huge Ætna lifts her towering pile, All Greece their boundless praise proclaim.
Teach them, Great Jove, with meekness graced To tread the dazzling paths of Fame, And Fortune's choicest gifts to taste.
O YE, that by Cephisis' waves* profuse Dwell on the banks with steeds and pastures fair, Illustrious queens of proud Orchomenus, Listen, ye Graces, to my prayer- Ye, whose protecting eyes The Minyans't ancient tribes defend ;
From you life's sweets ‡ and purest ecstasies
On man's delighted race descend.
Genius, and Beauty, and Immortal Fame, Are yours :
without the soft majestic Graces Not e'en the gods in their celestial places
Or feast or dance proclaim.
Raised are their thrones on high Beside the Pythian lord* of day, That bends the golden how ;
where they All pastimes and solemnities above Blissful dispense, and sanctify Th’ eternal honours of Olympian Jove.
August Aglaia, blithe Euphrosynè, Daughters of Heaven's resistless king, And thou, that lovest the liquid lay, Thalia, hear my call, and see The choiring minstrels on their way, By favouring fortune wooed, With festive steps advancing :

Thou hast extinguish’d, † while by thee On Jove’s own sceptre ‡ lull'd the Feather'd King Forgets his awful ministry, And hangs from either flank the drooping wing :
Thou his beaked crest around Hast pour'd the cloud of darkness soft, And o'er his beaming eyeballs bound

While on his broad and shaggy breast Sicilians regions rest, And hoary AEtna, pillar of the sphere, With her bleak snows through all the year Nursed in her angry arms, presses the monster down :
Bursting from whose cavern'd side
The living fountains waste their way Of unapproachable fire ;
whose tide With clouds of smouldering fume bedims the sultry day ;
Reddening at night th' inflamed flood Rolls off the lifted rocks, and down the steep Plunges beneath the bellowing deep.
Meanwhile that Serpent t from his dungeon rude Sends his dread fire-spouts to the air, Vulcanian streams portentous to behold !
Strange e'en the traveller's tongue to hear
Of sights and sounds so dire the tale unfold;
How on Ætna’s burning base Beneath her dark umbrageous head Chain'd and immured the rugged place Gores all his writhing bulk, that rues that restless bed.‡
Grant me, Great Jove, thy smiles to know, Lord of this mountain, whose high front commands
In circuit wide th' abundant lands;
Graced with whose name* the bordering state below Shares its great founder's large renown, By herald's voice at Pytho's listening games Declared ;
while Hiero's chariot-crown, A monarch's meed, th' inspiring note proclaims.
From heaven a fresh propitious gale
With ardent prayer the seaman craves, To wing with speed his parting sail;
While Hope a prosperous course foretells From that good presage o'er the waves :
Thus blest with omen fair
Of earliest fame, while Ætna’s realm excels, The Muse her future glories shall declare;
Her gorgeous feasts, her coursers proud.
Her choirs to chant the victor's lay— O thou, whose radiant sway Delos and Lycia rules;
t whose haunt is still
The mount that pours Castalia's rill;
Accept thy suppliant's prayer;
her streets with heroes crowd.
Good the gods alone dispense, All arts, all worth from them we trace;
And Wit, and Might, and Eloquence Are but the gifts divine of bounteous Nature's grace.
But thou this prince's praise to sing Intent, as some the brazen javelin wield,* Urge not thy song beside the field, But forward far, where rivals ne'er can fling.
Unchanging Fortune's golden shower, With Virtue's goodlier boon, the cloudless mind, Time on his state benignant pour, And calm Oblivion shade the toils behind.

The wars he waged, the fields he won, While patient bravery nerved his breast;
What honours sent from heaven around their temples shone, By Grecian hand ne'er pluck'd before, To crown their wealth a glorious diadem.*
His dauntless mind with pangs extreme, Though rack'd, war's toil, like Philoctetes,† bore :
Princes his aid with flattery sought, And wooed, by Fortune press'd, his saving power.
'Twas thus th' Hellenian heroes brought From Lemnian rocks, in Troy's disastrous hour,Pæan’s brave son, with wasting wound, Though weak and worn, whose fatal bow Razed Priam's Ilion to the ground.

For such was Fate's decree.

On sack'd Amyclæ’s prosperous plain, By whose famed border the Tyndarean host Their milk-white steeds illustrious train ;
Such martial sires the tribes of Ætna boast.
Mighty Jove, to those, that live By fruitful Amelia's* murmuring tide, Subjects and prince, like freedom give, By Truth's unerring rule their faultless course to guide.
Inspired by thee, by practice sage, His son's, his people's steps the sire shall lead

Oh, then, from Himera's banks the glittering bough I'll pluck to plant on Virtue's brow, And bid those echoing shores their foes' disasters tell.
Wouldst thou foil the censurer's sneer, Thy copious theme in narrowest pale Confine ;
nor pall th' impatient ear
That throbs for fresh delights, and loathes the lengthening tale.
With forced applause, with grief profound, The vulgar audience listens to the lays
That swell the prosperous stranger's praise :
Yet since the flatterer Envy's deadliest wound Pains not the brave like Pity's tear, Cling thou to Good ;
thy vessel's martial throng
With the sure helm of Justice steer And on Truth's anvil steel thy guarded tongue ;
Sparks of mischief struck from thee Spread far and wide th' authentic flame :
Thousands observe thy sovereignty;
A thousand listening ears bear witness to thy shame.
If yet Fame's dulcet voice to hear Thou long'st, still crowed to stand at Virtue's post, Oh I shrink not from the worthless cost;
But, like a brave and liberal captain, spare
Thy spreading canvass to the wind.

Whose heavenly friendship used amiss *
To madness fired his impious head :
What time the matchless consort of high Jove He tried, by blind presumptuous love To that wild outrage moved.
Full soon the just return
A strange unpractised pain he bore, Two bold misdeeds condemn'd at once to mourn :
For he, a hero deem'd, with kindred gore
His hands had stain'd, and first by fraud design'd
The foulest murder of his kind;
He to the secret bower unseen, Jove's genial chamber, stole, And tempted there the eternal Queen- 0, could man's wit his wish control, His true dimensions learn it A host of woes Unlicensed Lust's indulgence knows !
Witness this thoughtless dupe, that wooed a shadowy cloud, And made th' enchanting cheat his bride :
Fair, heavenly fair, like Saturn's daughter proud, Look'd the bright form his baseness to deride;
So well Jove's art had wrought the flattering bane.-
Now in his quadri-radiate chain,(Rack self-devised) * inextricably bound
He with stretch'd limbs and doleful cry, Deals his sad precept round.
Meanwhile with love unblest that air-drawn effigy

Truth in all states her fearless front may rear ;
Whether proud kings, or fierce democracies, Or sapient peers the public weal maintain.
Strive not with God ;
thy rage is vain;
He for wise ends the virtuous magnifies, Or deigns the worthless head to raise With glory to the skies.
Still
Envy rests not here :
in faithless scale she weighs
Her weak pretence 'gainst Merit's claim, And in the struggle to be blest Oft guides the wandering poniard's aim, E'en to her own unguarded breast.
'Tis temperate Wisdom's care With light contented heart to beat Life's galling yoke.*
To kick the pointed goad, t And wound the heel, yet keep the load, Is the fool's cure.

Such, as when erst his fostering care
The hero Æsculapius ‡bred ;
Who first taught pain the writhing wretch to spare, Touch'd by whose healing hand the pale diseases fled.

who midst the throe, While Ilithyia † watch'd her matron cries, Pierced with the thrilling dart that flies From stern Lucina's golden bow, Changed by Apollo's power o'ercome Her painful chamber for the tomb.
So fearful 'tis for man to move
The vengeance of the sons of Jove She in her frailty's wanton mood The bright-hair'd God's approach repell'd (Whose love so late her wavering heart subdued) E'en while his heavenly seed her genial bosom swell'd:
She to her sire unknown a prince ‡ adored.
No more the bridal feast § or damsel train

she stay'd not till they pour'd
In melting choir their hymenèal strain, Or to soft airs for maiden meet Warbled their wonted vesper sweet.
Her thoughts on absent raptures rove, The torturing dream of all that love.
Fond mortals thus the gifts refuse
Of tendering Fortune with disdain ;
While Hope some distant trifle views
And hunts the flying prize* in vain.
That fatal fault within her alter'd breast
The fair Coronis nursed :
away she threw Her virgin robes, and madly flew To clasp her loved Arcadian guest :
Unmark'd not of the Seer divine, † Whose victims heap the Pythian shrine
There throned within his temple pale Sage Loxias knew th' unseemly tale, By sure direct communion taught
The glance of his omniscient mind :
Falsehood beguiles not him ;
nor act, nor thought, Nor man, nor potent God his searching sight can blind.
Thus, while on love Eilatian Ischys bent
He view'd, his feign'd pretence and deed unchaste, To Lancereia's towers* in haste
The god his vengeful sister t sent, Where rose by Bcebias' distant flood Th' afflicted maid's forlorn abode, Now by the Power, whose baleful sway Lured her from Virtue's paths to stray, Shamed and destroy'd.

Thus briefly, from the lifeless fair, Whom with one pace he reach'd (the pyre Self-opening to the saving sire), Away the struggling child he bare, And bade the Pelian Centaur sage * Store its young mind with precepts rare Disease and mortal pain to 'suage.
All those, whose sickly temperaments betray'd
The natural sore ;
all whom the griding sword, The whirling rock, had crush'd or gored;
All whom the blistering flames had flay'd;
All through whose limbs keen winter's breath
Had blown the drowsy chill of death ;
(Whate'er the pang their frames endured)
Each of his several bane he cured.
This felt the charm's enchanting sound;
t That drank th' elixir's soothing cup ;
Some with soft hand in sheltering bands he bound, Or plied the searching steel and bade the lame leap up.
Yet Wisdom's self the lust of gain betrays :
Him too Corruption with her rich reward, Her glittering gilded hand, ensnared With impious art the dead to raise.

Roused at the deed indignant Jove Through both at once his lightning drove ;
At whose dread shock and instant blast From both their breasts the spirit pass'd ;
So quick the flaming courier speeds.

And beg the boon our mortal misery needs, By sad experience taught of what frail race we are.
Dare not, my soul, immortal life to crave ;
The practicable good strive thou to gain-
But 0 ! that still yon mountain cave Sage Chiron held, where this mellifluous strain With tuneful charm his heart might move Some healing power to send, from Jove Or Phœbus sprung, with spells endued, To still the pangs that rack the good.
* With him the bounding bark I'd mount, And ride the rough Ionian wave,† By Arethusa's bubbling fount‡
My kind Ætnæan host to save :
Him Syracuse reveres,§ her lenient king, Whose pride ne'er pined at Virtue's just success;
Whose love th' unfriended strangers bless O !could I reach thy realm, and bring Health, golden Health,* with Song to grace The wreath that crown'd thy Pythian race, (Which late from Cirrhat to thy shore The matchless Pherenicus ‡bore),
Then should thy glorious minstrel shine From far with beams of goodlier light, With two such gifts advancing o'er the brine, Than yon celestial star to thy rejoicing sight.
But to the Matron Goddess,* in whose praise
Oft near my portal at the midnight hour With Pan their hymns the damsels pour, For thee my distant voice I'll raise.
If, Hiero, thy discernment knows
The flower on wisdom's word that grows ;
Oft hast thou learnt from sapient age, Guide of thy youth, this precept sage, That " with each boon kind Fate bestows “
Two banes the chastening gods combine," Banes to the fool, but blessings to the wise, Who clear th' incrusting coil, and bid the diamond shineThee Heaven hath prosperd ;
for if Fortune's eye E'er beams on mortal, 'tis the conqueror King :
Yet with unchanged, uncloudy sky Not e'en for Peleust shone th' eternal spring, Nor godlike Cadmus;
† though they heard, To that surpassing bliss preferr'd, The golden-vested Muses fill With songs of joy their echoing hill, Sev'n-portall'd Thebes repeat the strain ;
When this Harmonia's hand endow'd, On that sage Nereus from the main Thetis, his glorious child, bestow'd.
Gods from the spheres came down their feast to grace, Where they their nuptial gifts from Saturn's sons, Ethereal kings on golden thrones, Took, and beheld them face to face.
Thus, for past cares and toils forgot, Their hearts corrected with their lot,* The smiles of favouring Heaven they found;
Sorrow unseen yet hover'd round :
Cadmus, at life's distressful close, His phrensied children's † furies press'd;
Though genial Jove one for his consort chose, And soothed his power divine on fair Thyone's breast.
Peleus, to whom immortal Thetis gave One matchless son, ‡on Phrygia's fatal plain
By shaft obscure untimely slain, Mourn'd with all Greece his early grave.
If there be one, whose wisdom crown'd Th' unerring paths of Truth has found, 'Tis his with heart uplift to Heaven T' improve the gift its grace has given.
The winds that sweep the vaulted sky Shift every hour their changeful way ;
And when on man swelling Prosperity In all its fulness comes, it will not, must not stay.
Humble in want, in greatness I'll be great, Still to my fortune's form I'll shape my will, My wit the follower of my fate.
Should some kind god my lap with affluence fill, To Fame's high peak my hopes aspire :
Sarpedon and the Pylian sire All ages know, to all procJaim'd
In sounding song by Genius framed.*
Her title to the breathing lyre Virtue in charge securely gives ;
But rare the hand.
whose touch can fire
Th' immortal strain,by which she lives.
TO-DAY beside thy friend Arcesilas,
The steed-renown'd Cyrene's‡ bounteous king, Stand, heavenly Muse, his minstrel choir to grace ;
And swell the gale of triumph, as they sing Latona's twins and Pytho's plain ;
Where, while Apollo fill'd the fane,§
His priestess, from her shrine above Between the golden || birds of Jove, Decreed, that on yon fruitful coast Battus* should plant his alien host Embarking from the sacred Isle,t and found
The town for chariots famed on Libya's glittering mound ;
Battus the tenth and seventh ‡ of his line
Thus destined to fulfil th' eventful word, Which erst at Thera from her lips divine
The raging daughter of Æetes pour'd.
'Twas thus to Jason's godlike train § The Colchian queen || address'd her strain:
" Hear, what my labouring soul forebodes, " Ye sons of heroes and of gods ;
"How Epaphus' child* in after-days "
From this wave-wander'd islet shall raise "Within the precincts‡ of the Ammonian king "A root, whence cities proud, and peopled realms shall spring."
They from the Dolphin's puny chase "
Shall turn, the generous steed to train, “And urge for oars the chariot's race " With tempest speed and flowing rein. "
Great parent thus shall Thera§ shine “Of mighty states ;
so doom'd by pledge divine, " When in man's form the social god, " Where cool Tritonis pours her issuing lake,* " His country's symboll'd soil bestow'd ;
"
From the high prow, that sacred gift to take, " Down stepp'd Euphemus ;
and consenting Jove " Clang'd t the loud thunder from above."
'Twas when the parting crew on Argo's side "
Their anchor brazen-fang'd, her steady rein, " Were fastening-(we through deserts waste and wide "
Twelve tedious days preceding from the main "
Our lifted bark laborious bore, " Haul'd by my counsels to the shore-)
"At that portentous hour alone "The God came forth :
his aspect shone " Gracious, as of a reverend man ;
"
And frank and kind his accents ran;
"
As when some generous lord his entering guest "
With cheerful welcome greets, and bids him to the feast:
"
Yet briefly (for th' excuse of sweet return " Press'd us), 'his name Eurypylus,'* he said, "' Sprung from th' immortal Sire whose billowy bourne " '
Shakes the loud shore;
' nor more our haste delay'd, "But without parley from the ground "
Snatch'd the first pledge his friendship found :
"
Forth leapt our hero to the strand, "With hand extended grasp'd his hand, " And gladly from the tendering god "
Accepted the propitious clod ;
"
Which late at eve wash'd from the vessel's side Sunk in the brine, they say, beneath the weltering tide."
Full oft I charged th' attendant band, " Now freed from heavier toil or thought, " To guard it well;
my vain command "
Full soon their heedless hearts forgot.
" Thus on this isle th' immortal seed "
Of Libya's fortune eye its hour is shed;
" For if to Tsenarus'† sacred shade "
Euphemus hence return'd, that mystic boon "
By Hell's terrestrial gates had laid (" Yon godlike prince, steed-mastering Neptune's son, " Whom Tityus'* daughter by Cephisus † shore " Erewliile the famed Europa bore)," Then, when the Greeks went forth, as go they shall, " From Lacedæmon,‡ in the fourth descent, a And Argos and Mycenæ's swarming wall, " His blood had ruled that boundless continent. "
Now must he raise in strange embrace "
With barbarous dames § his chosen race ;
"
That led by Heaven with fortune's smile "
Shall reach this rude sequester'd isle, "And rear a mortal doom'd to reign * " The lord of Libya's cloud-black plain.
Him with abstruse response and hint divine "
Heard from the Pythian domes and gold-encumber'd shrine," Phœbus with fleets and hosts in happier days "
Shall warn the clime to seek, where o'er the land " Saturnian Nile † his fattening moisture lays "
Such was Medea's lore :
th' heroic band Speechless in fix'd amazement stood Thrill'd at the marv'llous truths she show'd.
Blest son of Polymnestus,‡ thee Portray'd in that proud prophecy, Thee with her sweet spontaneous strain The Delphian maid proclaim'd again :
Three times thy state she hail'd, and gave the word
That sent thee crown'd away, Gyrenè's destined lord,Thee to that shrine a suppliant sent With prayers thy faltering speech to cure-
Now prospering in the eighth descent Still on the throne thy sons endure ;
Where in youth's prime Arcesilas Fresh as the spring his purple flower displays.
On him with crowns th' Amphictyons* wait Giv'n by Apollo for his Pythian race :
Him to the Muse I'll consecrate ;
Him and th' all-golden fleece, whose distant place
When erst through many a wave the Minyans t found Glories from heaven their temples crown'd.
But whence that voyage ?
what necessity Bound on their hearts its adamantine chain ?
'Twas Pelias'‡ doom by fraud or force to die By AEolus' renown'd descendants slain.
For e'en his soul with wisdom fill'd
The threatening Oracle had chill'd ;
That, breathed from Delphi's central cave, The wood-crown'd Earth's mysterious nave, § Bade him with all his kingly care
The single-sandall'd wight beware, Come when he should, stranger or citizen, Down from his mountain hold to famed Iolcus' glen.
*All at th' appointed time, with ported spears
In either hand appear'd the dreadful man :
Shaped in Magnesian guise a garb he wears, That round his glorious limbs compacted ran ;
O'er which a pard-skin from the storm Shelter'd his stout unshuddering form.
His mantling locks + unshorn, unbound, In nature's wildness waving round, Down his broad back illustrious shook :
Forward all bent on speed he broke, Till in the forum halting, calm unmoved Amidst th' inquiring crowd his dauntless heart he proved.
Unknown he stood—" Apollo's mien " Is this?" some gazing wonderer cried, " Or his, that wooed ‡ the Cyprian queen, " Whose reins the brazen chariot guide ? "
In flowery Naxos ages since " Otus and Ephialtes,§ daring prince, * Iphitnedia's offspring died :
" Tityus,* gigantic form, Diana slew, " When from her chaste and quiver'd side "
Her huntress-bolt th' unconquer'd virgin drew ;
"
That warn'd from joys forbidden t men might haste "
The practicable bliss to taste.
"Thus they with vague surmise in crowds discoursed Listening and whispering;
when in burnish'd car Pelias with mules all panting thither forced
His urgent speed.
Astounded from afar
The stripling's dexter ancle round
He spied a single sandal ‡ bound ;
Yet with disguised alarm, " Proclaim, " Stranger," said he, " thy country's name ;
"
Tell me what matron born on earth "
From her fair bosom gave thee birth ? "
Let not the loathed lie thy lips disgrace, " But meet my just demand, and frankly tell thy race.
"Him with undaunted Virtue's accents mild Answer'd the youth, " From Chiron's school I come j "
The Centaur's daughters nursed me from a child, " And good Chariclo § made her cave my home.
" Now, when by their kind care sustain'a "
My strength its twentieth year has gain'd, For no foul deed, no phrase unchaste u From that sage intercourse displaced, " My home I visit, to require "
The ancient honours of my sire ;
"
Which erst to ruling Æolus* and his neirs "
Jove in his bounty gave, and now th' Usurper wears."
He by perverse ambition stung "
The traitor Pelias, as 'tis said, " Their sceptre from my parents wrung, " Which they by right with justice sway'd. "
They on my birth's eventful day "
Dreading that lawless ruler, in dismay "
My death pretended, and prepared " Domestic semblance of sepulchral rite ;
"
And female moans and sighs were heard :
"
Me swathed in purple, to the secret night "
Trusting their silent path, in Chiron's care "
They placed, the nurturer of their heir."
Such is my tale-Good people, tell me true­ "
My fathers rode the milk-white steed †-where stand "
Their stately towers ?—'tis Æson's son ye view ;
"
I come no alien to a stranger's land :
"
My godlike host, the centaur Seer, " The name of Jason bade me bear."
Thus spake the youth :
his father's glance Discern'd far off the son's advance, And the big tears of ecstasy Came bubbling from his aged eye, So swell'd his bursting heart with joy to find His lost illustrious boy the comeliest of mankind.
Thither in haste, allured by Jason's fame, His reverend uncles, from the neighbouring bowers By Hypereia's fountain, Pheres* came, Came Alllythaön from Messene's towers.
Admetus and Melampus too To greet their glorious kinsman flew.
With welcome warm and sumptuous feasts- Jason regaled his honour'd guests,
And freely without change or check
Threw loose the reins on Pleasure's neck :
Five days and nights in sympathy of soul Pluck'd they the laughing flowers, that crown the social bowl.
On the-sixth morn his plan proposed, Its cause, importance, means, and bent To all his kin the youth disclosed.
Forthwith they sallied from their tent, In haste for Pelias' mansion bore, And now already stood within the door.
The soft-hair'd Tyro's t artful son Spontaneous rose to meet the martial throng ;
When with mild air and soothing tone, Dropping sweet words that melted from his tongue, Jason the conference raised on Wisdom's base :
" Hear thou, Petræan Neptune's race, ‡" Prone is man's mind from Honour's arduous way "
To verge into the tempting paths of gain, " Rough in th' advance and leading far astray :
"
But thine and mine it must be to restrain "
Our wrath, and weave our future weal. " I speak to ears, that heed and feel.
"One parent's womb, thou knowest, of yore " Cretheus and bold Salmoneus bore ;
"
And we their grandsons thus look on "
The glory of the golden Sun. "
But when affection cools, and hateful ire " Rankles in kinsmen's hearts, the decent Fates retire."
Oh !
'tis not seemly thus with lance and shield "
That thou and I for honours ancestral a Base war should wage.
Take all my spacious field, " My flocks and brindled herds, I cede them all, " Which from my sire thy daring stealth " Forced and yet feeds, thy pamper'd wealth. "
I grudge thee not, and view with ease "
Thy house enhanced with spoils like these.
" But what I challenge for my own, " My sovereign sceptre,* and the throne " Whereon sat Æson, when the law divine "
His horsemen hosts received, these, Pelias, must be mine:
" These without conflict from thy hand, " Lest ill betide thee, yield us back."
Thus urged the prince his just demand ;
And thus e'en Pelias calmly spake :
"
Thy will be mine :
but me the late "
Remains of life's declining hour await;
“Thy youth now wantons in the bloom :
u Thou canst appease the subterranean powers ;
"
The soul of Phrixus* from the tomb Calls me, to bear him from Æetes’ towers “And seize the ponderous ram's refulgent hide, “That saved him from the raging tide,“Saved from th' incestuous stepdame's angrier dart. "
This to mine ear a dream miraculous "
Hath told :
for this have I with anxious heart "
Castalia's counsels ask'd, that urge me thus "
Thither with bark and band to speed­ "
Dare thou for me th' adventurous deed, "
And I will leave thee lord and king :
"
Jove, from whom all our races spring, " Be Jove himself t our binding oath, " Witness, and warrant of our troth."
This compact to the chiefs propounded they With full consent approved, and parting went their way.
His heralds loud now Jason bade proclaim
The perilous enterprise.
Three sons of Jove Unmatch'd in combat at that bidding came, The fruits of Leda's, and Alcmena's, love.*
With these two lofty-crested chiefs From Pylus' towers and Tænarus’ cliffs, Enthusiasts of renown, and held Men of tried heart in valour's field ;
Euphemus this,✝ from Neptune sprung, That Periclymenus the strong.
Illustrious Orpheus ‡ too, the minstrel's sire, Apollo's offspring, came, and smote th' inflaming lyre.
Hermes, that waves the golden wand,* His youthful sons, Echion fair And Erytus, with the vent'rous band Despatch'd, the rough exploit to share.
Down came the youths, that dwelt below Pangæum's wintry base:
t for Boreas now Pleased with such service, king of storms;
Sent forth in haste his wondrous progeny Zetas and Calais, mortal forms, With plume-rough backs and purple wings to fly.
Juno ‡ their hearts with sweet persuasive zeal Inspired to bound on Argo's keel,To court the tempting toil:
that none might long
To waste undanger'd § on his mother's arm Youth without glory;
but his peers among Find e'en in death th' inestimable charm
That cheers the close of Valour.
Now Iölcus reach'd in godlike row Stood the choice crew :
Jason their look Heroic praised, their numbers took. || By auguries* watch'd, by chances caut Mopsust assured of heaven, in haste
The panting band embark'd, and from below The lifted anchor hung upon the dancing prow.
High on the stern a golden goblet rear'd
The chief, and to the sire of all the gods, The lightning-lanced Jove, his prayer preferr'd ;
Invoked the powers, that sway the winds and floods, The sea's wild ways, the nights forlorn, And smiling days, and sweet return.
Heav'n's prompt assent in accents loud
Spake the big thunder from the cloud, And playful pour'd in volleys bright Its fractured beams ‡ of harmless light.
Paused those rude heroes, by that gleam divine
And sound ambiguous awed—Mopsus, that hail'd the sign,Cheer'd to their oars the rallied crew, And with sweet hopes their hearts inspired :
At their stout stroke the galley flew ;
Toss'd from their blades the surge retired.
Soon by the breathing South impelled To Axine's stormy mouth * their course they held;
There to the billowy Neptune rear'd A sacred shrine † and altar marbled o'er, And made their offering from the herd Of Thracian bulls, that pastured on the shore ;
Then, as the danger deepen'd, all adored Of ships and seas the mighty lord;
So their frail bark the justling rocks ‡ might shun, Frightful collision!-
Twain, self-moved, they were, Alive, with wild rotation whirling on Swift as the roaring winds-In mid career TL?
passing demigods before Awe-struck they stopped and raged no more.
Now, Phasis reach'd, in converse sweet The Greeks and dusky Colchians meet:
Æetes * ruled the barbarous land.
Then first the Cyprian queen, whose hand Points the resistless arrow, from above Her mystic Iynxt brought, the maddening Bird of Love,Fast in his quadri-radiate circlet bound, Charm of mankind :
and incantations strange Æson's sage son she taught, and spells profound;
Spells, that Medea's filial faith might change, And for fair Greece her feverish heart I Seduce from that wild beach to part.
Touch'd by Persuasion's gentle goad, ‡ All her sire's arts and toils she show'd :
Soft oils and antidotes § she gave Her Jason's beauteous form to save ;
Till all prepared to Hymen's sweet control
Their mutual loves they pledged and mingled soul with soul.
But when Æetes full in sight His adamantine plough produced
His furious bulls, whose nostrils bright Flames of consuming fire diffused, Battering the ground with brazen tread;
These single-handed to their yokes he led ;
And steadfast drove his furrow'd line Straight through the smoking glebe, severing in twain An acre's breadth* Earth's sturdy spine. "
Let him that ruled your vessel o'er the main "
Do me this deed," the vaunting chieftain cries, " And be th' immortal Felt his prize," His the rich fleece, that glows with flakes of gold."
Off, at that challenge roused, his saffron vest Flung Jason, and in Love's assurance bold Closed on the task :
charmed by his bride's behest Singed not his frame the raging fire, Forward he drags the team and tire ;
Their necks in close constraint he joins,!
Stirs with sharp goad their struggling loins, And with stout arm and manly grace Works out with ease th' appointed space.
In speechless pang, yet muttering at the sight, Aghast Æetes stood and marvell'd at his might.
‡Forth to their gallant chief th' heroic throng Stretch'd their glad hands, crown'd him with chaplets green, And gratulations pour'd from every tongue.-
Now to the secret haunt, where hung unseen
The glittering skin by Phrixus spread, Sol's wondrous son the strangers led ;
Nor ween'd that mortal enterprise Could from that toil triumphant rise.
Deep in a dark defile it lay :
,
A ravening dragon* watch'd the way, In bulk like some huge galley, thick and long, With ir'n compact, and work'd by fifty rowmen strong.
But the time urges, and 'twere long
The vulgar tedious path to tread;
I know the readier route of song ;
And Wisdom follows where I lead.
Arcesilas, by art beguiled
The blue-eyed motley serpent Jason foil'd ;
With stol'n Medea, Pelias' bane, The boisterous Ocean cross'd, and Red-sea flood To shores, where now th' heroic train 'Mong Lemnian wives,† stain'd with their husbands' blood, Vied for the mantle prize in naked grace, And clasp'd them in their warm embrace.
On that famed day or night, by Fate's decree 'Mong tribes barbarian on a distant strand Dawn'd the first beam of thy great destiny.
There first the race that shall for ages stand, Of proud Euphemus* hail'd the day With Spartan dames and customs they Mingling and swarming forth erewhile Peopled Callista's beauteous isle :
t From whence thy sires o'er Libya's waste Honour'd as gods Apollo placed, And gave with counsels just and laws unknown Cyrenè's realms to rule, and grace her golden throne.
Use now the wit of CEdipus profound—‡
If one with sharpened axe and reckless stroke Lops as he lists the sightly branches round
And shames the honours of the spreading oak :
Though fruit thereon no longer glows, Still her proud bulk and strength she shows,
What time in winter's hour of need
The crackling hearth her fragments feed ;
Or stretch'd along § the lengthening row Of stateliest columns rear'd below Some stranger's pressing palace she sustains With firm unfailing trunk, forced from th' unshelter'd plains.
Thou art the leech, the times require, And Pæan * speeds thy skill profound ;
With lenient hand, relenting sire, Soften and heal thy subjects' wound.
The worst, the weakest t from its base A state with ease may shake ;
but to replace Th' accomplish'd pile is power indeed, Unless some guardian spirit in his love Seize the loose helm, the leaders lead.
For thee that grace the favouring Fates have wove.
Oh !
dare then for thy loved Cyrenè's weal Strain all thy strength, use all thy zeal.
A. goodly messenger,‡ as Homer sings (Heed thou the tuneful sage), acceptance gives And estimation to the charge he brings.
So from her virtuous theme the Muse derives Honour and grace.
Th' illustrious house* Of Battus, all thy realm allows Damophilus unmatch'd in truth, Generous and just;
'mong boys a youth, In counsel provident and sage As one that boasts a century's age.
He of its sparkling jest the slanderous tongue Bereaves :
with honest hate he meets th' oppressor's wrong.
Thus with the wise and good no strife hath he, Ardent and urgent of his upright plan j
For well he knows, that Opportunity (Which he observes, not serves) rests not with man A moment's pause.
'Tis bitterest pain To know, yet need, and crave in vain
The sweets that friends and freedom give :
Thus doth this suffering Atlas + strive, From wealth and kin and country driven, Against thy weight, his pressing heaven.
Yet Jove the Titans loosed, and when the gale Vexes the deep no more, we furl the useless sail.
Worn out with lingering ills, his prayer
Is still to greet his native plain, By Cyrè's fount* the feast to share
And yield to youth his soul again.
There rank'd among the minstrel choir To touch with gifted hand the burnish'd lyre, Warbling in peace his harmless lay, Nor offering to his foes nor suffering wrong.
Oh I that his lips bad power to say
What recent fountains of ambrosial song Flowing for great Arcesilas he found, Illustrious guest on Theban ground.
WEALTH is wide-extended power, Whene’er with genuine worth combined Man leads it forth in Fortune's favouring hour And friendships throng behind.
Thee, heav'n-enhanced Arcesilas, These gifts through all thy glorious days From life's first step, by Castor's t grace, Have bless'd ;
who now with Pythian bays Given from his golden car thy brows hath crown'd :
'Twas he the threatening storm allay'd
That shook thy prosperous house and spread
The cheering calm, thai brightens round.
Wisdom still with temperate hand Improves the boon by Heaven bestow’d ;
And thee, that walk'st with Justice through the land, A thousand blessings crowd.
First as thou art the sceptred lord
Of mighty realms, and bear'st combined By Nature for that proud reward, The ruler's eye, the sage's mind :
Next as thy coursers from the Pythian plain Have born the glorious prize away, While Phœbus gives thee to display Th' exulting pomp and choral strain.
O cease not, while the song, that swells thy fame, Sounds through Cyrenè’s echoing towers, Where Venus spreads* her sweetest bowers, God the great cause of all things to proclaim.
First of thy peers be great Carrhotus† styled ;
He brought not to th' applauding plain, Where Battus’‡ just descendants reign, Excuse, repentant Epimethes' child ;
§ But foremost in the chariot-course By pleased Castalia's sacred source Th' accepted stranger pass'd, and round Thy kingly locks his wreath of glory bound.
Twelve times round the measured bourn
With heel unmatch'd, uninjured rein, Flew the swift steeds, nor tire nor trapping torn-
Lo !
where by Delphi's fane
Hangs the fair chariot * (sound and bright
As from the sculptor's hand it wheel’d Beneath the steep Crisæan height t To th' hollow plain and sacred field), Slung from the cypress beam, the God beside ;
Where by the Cretan archers' hands Hewn from one trunk his statue stands, The rich Parnassian temple's pride.
Him with grateful heart we praise, Whose deeds exalt his country's king :
On thee, Alexibiades,‡ their rays
The bright-hair'd Graces fling ;
Blest in the minstrel's mindful strain, Thy rare exploit's leward, to live :
Twice twenty chariots strew'd the plain, Thy wheels ungrazed, thy steeds survive :
Skill hath no place but in the brave man's breast;
Now from the glorious games once more His Libyan plains, his native shore, The youth's triumphant steps have press'd.
Thus labour still, man's painful part, remains.
Yet mark !
the same propitious Power (The stranger's light, the nation's tower)
That beam'd on ancient Battus, still sustains
The throne he stablish'd, and with gifts profuse Blesses his people.
Him, 'tis said, The stately lions* roaring fled :
His alien speech their awe-struck ire subdues.
Phœbus himself, that led the way, Gave their fierce natures to dismay ;
That no rude chance might stay Cyrenè’s lord
In his great course, or thwart th' unerring word.
†Phoebus dire disease's cure
To seers and sapient matrons shows :
He gave the lyre, and on his favourites pure Th' inspiring Muse bestows (The Muse, that wins from ruthless war The soften'd soul to love and peace) :
He rules the shrine oracular ;
Where warn'd by him th' Herculean race‡
Sought with th' Ægimians on Laconian ground, In Pyle and Argos their abode.
The praise, from Sparta's deeds that flow'd, Be mine in partial strain to sound.
Spartans born my favoured sires From .,Egeus sprung to Thera came :
Fate led them to the land,* whose sacred fires
With many a victim flame.
Thence, Phœbus, thy Carneian rites †
To proud Cyrenè’s mount we bore, Still hallowing as the feast invites, Her fair-built fanes and echoing shore.
Thither Antenor's sons,‡ Troy's brave remains, By hostile flames in ruin laid, With Helen's Grecian wanderers fled, And left their sons th’ adopted plains.
There dwelt that race of warlike charioteers, To whose heroic shades the band, That lead by Battus rules the land, Still slays the sacrifice, the altar rears ;
Battus, whose winged galleys through the brine Oped their deep passage.
For the gods
High groves* he raised, their dark abodes :
He the Scyrotan t to Apollo's shrine, Where the full pomp with prancing steed Imploring blessings might proceed, His spacious causeway planned.
The Forum nigh Aloof the vulgar tombs his reliques lie.
Blest his mortal part he bore ;
In death a hero's rites he knows :
Their sacred kings far off, the walls before, In humbler rest repose.
Still in the shades beyond the grave
Our liquid lays their spirits hear, Shedding soft dews and streams that lave
The living flower their virtues bear ;
Lays, that with them Arcesilas record
Their glorious son ;
whose choral train ‡
Now sing for him in sounding strain Phœbus who waves the flaming sword,Him, who sends from Pytho's hills
The graceful song, that far o'erbuys
The cost of conquest, to the prince § that fills
The praises of the wise.
'Tis but the general cale :
in wit, In words, with age his youth may vie ;
Bold as the Sovereign bird, whose might With wings expanded awes the sky.
His strength in contest, like the tower in war :
A child the Muses' haunts he knew, Still on their pinion soars :
and who Shall guide with him the glowing carAll the domestic paths that lead to fame, His enterprising steps have tried;
And well th' approving gods supplied His purposes with power.
Through life .
the same Grant him, in act resolved, in counsel sage, Blest sons of Saturn, long to know ;
Nor let th' autumnal tempest blow To blast the ripe abundance of his age :
Jove, whose high will exalts and moves
The destiny of those he loves, Vouchsafe the sons of Battus to obtain Like wreaths of glory from th' Olympian plain.0 LISTEN, while we till the flowery field, Where soft-eyed Venus and the Graces t reign, Hastening with duteous step our vows to yield Within Earth's murmuring nave ‡ and central fane :
Where for th' Emmenian tribe § renown'd, And watery Agrigent, and great Xenocrates with Pythian conquest crowned, Apollo's proud retreat Enshrines, its golden stores among, The treasure || of our rich triumphal song.
Song, that nor wintry showery nor driving hail, Keen squadrons of the pitiless thunder-cloud, Nor weltering sands shall beat, nor sweeping gale Sink in the caverns of th' all-whelming flood :
But with fair front, that courts the day, Thine and thy sire's* commingled praise, Wherewith the world rings loudly, shall display, And tell in glory's lays How bravely, Thrasybule, ye won In Crisa's echoing valet the chariot-crown.
There, while thine hand thy fathers fame sustained, Well didst thou keep the precept, which of old Far from paternal care Pelides‡ gain'd From Wisdom's lips in Chiron's mountain-hold ;
"
Before all powers to fear and love "
The god that wields the lightning’s fire, " The deep-mouth'd thunder's lord, Saturnian Jove ;
" Next, to thy reverend sire, " Through all his life's appointed day, " With her that gave thee thine, like honours pay.
"Warm’d with such thoughts
Antilochus the brave Single withstood the furious Memnon’s force Back'd by his Æthiop host, and nobly gave Himself to save his sire ;
whose fainting horse Paris * with many a shaft had maim'd,
And check'd his chariot's fierce career :
Whereat his ponderous lance the chieftain aim d Full at the Pylian seer :
Moved at the danger, not appall’d, “Help, help, my son," the weak old warrior call'd.
That voice unheeded fell not to the ground;
Firm stood the godlike youth, and with his own Ransom’d his father's life.
Thenceforth renown'd ’Mong youths of earlier times he shines alone.
All hearts his generous virtues move ;
All tongues th' egregious deed extoll’d,
And crown'd it with the palm of filial love.
Such things were fame of old :
Of all the living, Thrasybule Most shapes his progress by his father's rule,Nor shines not by his glorious uncle’s † side.
Wisely his wealth he uses ;
nurses well Youth's flower, nor shrunk with vice nor flush'd with pride, Gathering fresh wisdom in the Muses' dell.
Thee, founder of the equestrian race, Neptune, that shakest the billowy strand, Thee and thy toils his fond pursuits embrace :
Yet with the social band
In converse mingling, sweet is he As the stored cell-work of the mountain bee.
TAKE, Minstrel, when thy glowing lyre displays Th' equestrian triumphs of Alcmæon’s † race, Great Athens ‡ for thy theme, the proudest base Whereon the structure of thy strain to raise.
What country's native can we name Sprung from what nobler house, th' applause of Greece to claim ?
Through all our streets the talk, the general tale Dwells on Erechtheus’ people ;
§ by whose hands 1/ Rear'd on thy Pythian rocks, Apollo, stands Yon gorgeous temple.
Thither borne I hail From Isthmus five, from Cirrha twain, And one distinguish'd wreath from Jove's Olympian plain,Won by thy matchless ancestry, Illustrious Megacles, and thee.
Thy fresh success with joy we greet;
Yet sorrowing mark, how Envy’s pace Still runs by Virtue in the race, Ill-paid Desert disasters meet, And Fortune's wintry gales destroy The fairest blossoms of our joy.0 PEACE,* by whom all hearts one friendship share, And mightiest empires stand-;
Daughter of Justice, in whose hand Hang the great keys of council and of war :
—
For conquering Aristomenes Accept the Pythian crown we weave :
Thou know'st the season of soft courtesies.
The grace to take or give.
But when th' aggressors wrong thy friends sustain, And foes thy power engage, Then dost thou roughen into rage, And plunge presumptuous insult in the main.
Too late the rash Porphyrion* taught
Thy sharp rebuke, thy vengeance tries ;
Taught, how secure the gain by Justice bought, How dear the plunderer's prize.
Thou in his hour each vaunter hast subdued :
Not Typhon's hundred heads thy watchful power Eluded or repell'd, Nor he that led the giant brood :
Their feud the volleying thunder quell'd, With fierce Apollo's arrowy shower ;
Who now with favouring look receives Xenarces' son from Cirrha's plain, Crown'd with his own Parnassian leaves, The shouting choir and Dorian strain.
Nor lies that beauteous isle, t where Justice sways, Where Virtue's touch divine Still warms the great Æacean line, Far from the Graces thrown.
From earliest days
A proud illustrious name she boasts :
The chiefs her teeming cities yield First in the games, among conflicting hosts
The heroes of the field.
Such are her glories—but the time would fail, Th' exhausted ear would tire, From voice and soft enchanting lyre
Of all her deeds to hear the lengthen'd tale.
But to my task-aloft the song, Due to thy young exploit, shall spring, Plumed by mine heart to bear thy fame along High on her sounding wing.
Thou in the wrestler's field the steps hast traced
Of thy stout uncles :
thou nor Theognete,* With braid Olympian crown'd, Hast with thy Pythian proof disgraced ;
Nor stanch Cleitomachus, renown'd For his huge frame and Isthmian feat.
Thus thy Midylian tribe enhanced, Thy praise Œclides † well display'd, When to sev'n-portall'd Thebes advanced
The warlike sons his strain portray'd :
Twas when from Argos' walls their second train The Seven Descendants led :
"
The soul by nature bold," he said, That warms the generous father, glows again "
In the brave son.
Behold, behold, " At Cadmus' gates Alcmæon wield, " First in the fight, the dragon's motley mould "
That fires his blazon'd shield.
Adrastus too, by past disasters press'd, " Now, with fresh heart upheld "
By happier omen, fronts the field, " For future woes yet mark'd, at home unblest. "
He of the Danaän chiefs alone "
Shall come with whole unvanquish'd powers "
Yet gathering sad the relics of his son,* " To Abas' massy towers."
tThus sage Amphiaraüs taught the throng :
Nor with less rapture round Alcmæon's brows Will I the wreath entwine, Less bathe him with the dews of song :
For he my neighbour is ‡his shrine Guards with its shade my hallow'd house :
As to Earth's central dome I came, His spirit cross'd ray startled way, Touch'd with his sire's prophetic flame, And told the triumphs of the dav.
God of the radiant bow, by Pytho's clifts, Where thy proud rites sustain
The glorious all-frequented fane, Thou on this youth the noblest of thy gifts*
Hast lavish'd :
at thy feast before
The prompt Pentathlet's hasty prize
He snatch'd, thy bounty, on his native shore t Once more with favouring eyesBeam, I beseech thee, on th' harmonious lyre, Which foi the brave this hand A wakens:
:
Justice takes her stand Beside, and guides the sweet triumphal choir.
May Heaven's regard thy prosperous lot, Son of Xenarces, long sustain Though wise the weak account him that hath got Great fame with little pain,‡His life with wisdom arm'd, his counsels just;
'Tis not for man the blessing to command ;
From God all bounties flow :
This man he raises from the dust Aloft;
he lays another low, And metes him with his chastening hand.
Three times thy brow the crown has won:
At home in Juno's Games decreed, AirMegara, and in Marathon, Where might, not chance, achieved the deedHurl'd by thy fierce encounter from above, Four champions press'd the ground —
To them the Pythian judge profound Doomed not the sweet return, nor smile of love From fond maternal grace to meet;
Pierced with their sad mischance, alone, By path forlorn they slink and secret street, The taunting foe to shun.
But he, that hath some recent glory gain'd, On Exultation's wings, Lord of his hope, triumphant springs To heights which Wealth's low cares can ne'er ascend.
Yet ah !
how short the vernal hour Allow'd for mortal bliss to blow !
Fate from the stem soon shakes the fluttering flower, That droops and dies below.
Child of a day, what's man ?
what is he not ?
His life a shadow's dream !
yet when from Jove
The gladdening gleam appears, Then bright and brilliant is his lot, And calms unclouded gild his years-
Still, great Ægina,* join thy love With Jove's ;
thy realm in freedom hold;
And Æacus with sceptred hand, Peleus and Telamon the bold, And great Achilles guard the land!
I PANT the Pythian triumph to resound Of brazen-buckler'dt Telesicrates, Whom all the deep-zoned ‡Graces throng to please, The flower of proud Cyrenè, steed-renown'd.
Her,* once a huntress mountain maid, From Pelion's tempest-bellowing shade, Tress'd with the radiant locks of light Thy son, Latona, lured away, Rapt in his golden chariot bright, To realms where flocks unnumber'd stray.
Where trees with fruits perennial stand :
He made her mistress of the land, And gave the world's third continent to bloom With nature's loveliest works for fair Cyrenè's home.
Forth from his heavenly car her Delian guest t Love's silver-sandall'd Queen, with courteous touch
And soft reception, handed :
she their couch
In modesty's becoming drapery dress'd;
She bade the nuptial rite prepare, Such as became a god to share With powerful Hypseus' matchless maid- Hypseus, whose throne the Lapithæ, Haughty and brave in arms, obey'd :
His race from Ocean boasted he, A hero's offspring, whom of yore
The nymph divine Creiisa bore, Earth's guttering daughter, when to Peneus' love Her watery charms she gave in Pindus' warbled grove.
Heard by her father's hand, a damsel fair
Of comeliest form Cyrenè grew ;
She loved not the dull loom, nor e'er
The task-retracting shuttle threw;
Join'd not the soft domestic train
In tame delights of feast or dance, But with keen sword and brazen lance Rush'd on the ruthless savage of the plain.
So watch'd, her father's flocks securely fed ;
When the first streaks of morning broke, The slumbers from her lids she shook, Nor lost the precious prime on sloth's bewitching bed.
Her once the quiver'd distant-darting God With a fierce lion's rage—unarm'd, alone-
Struggling descried ;
whereat with cheering tone
He roused old Chiron † from his rude abode :
"
Haste from thy sombrous cave," he said, " And marvel at this martial maid :
"
Mark with what strength her spirit strains, " With what fell foe the unequal fight "
Her fair unpractised arm sustains;
" Tires not the toil her virgin might, " Nor freezing fear with danger press'd "
Ruffles her bold unshrinking breast. " Tell me what sire begot the generous child­ "
Sprung from what wondrous womb, among the mountains wild," Holds she her shadowy haunt, tasting of power "
E'en beyond manhood's licence ?
Tell me, Sire, "
Doth aught forbid the hand of chaste desire "
From that sweet plant to pluck the tempting flower ?
Moved at the warm request, with mild Relaxing brow and glistening eyes, The greatly-gifted Centaur smiled, Then thus with counsel pure replies :
"
'Tis soft persuasion's secret key " Unlocks the gates of ecstasy.
" Phcebus, with men, with gods above, " Prevails the same reserve of love, " That with conceal'd approach in virtue's guise "
Ascends without repulse the bed where beauty lies."
But since with thee no falsehood can remain, " Some playful freak thy tongue divine "
Impels this nescient mood to feign :
"
Thou learn from me a mortal's line ! "
Thou, who the ends of nature know'st, " Know'st all her means ;
the leaves that swell "
Earth's vernal bloom with ease canst tell;
"
Number the boundless sands that on the coast "
Of stream or sea the winds or waters beat;
" That with distinct regard canst see "
All things that are, have been, shall be ;
"
If yet the weak must teach, thy wisdom's want I meet."
Thou 'mongst these glades hast sought this maid's embrace;
" Hence shalt thou bear her o'er the swelling brine "
To Jove's delightful garden,* there to shine "
A kingdom's mistress, while the Island race † "
Her state by thee collected round "
People the plain-encompass'd mound.
" Meanwhile to greet th' illustrious maid "
For thee the reverend Libya comes, •' Her fields with spacious pastures spread ;
"
Thrones her within her golden domes, " And portions from her vast domain "
An empire for Cyrenè's reign, " Wanting nor fruit nor flower, the beauteous place "
Profuse, nor beast to rouse the raptures of the chase."
There shall she bear a son, thence far away "
On Herme's pinions wafted from the birth, " To where the bright-throned Hours and teeming Earth "
On their soft laps the illustrious babe shall lay.
" Blest Aristæus;
* they his lip "
Shall teach th' ambrosial food to sip, "
And crown with immortality, " In nectar quaff'd, the gifted boy :
" Guardian of flocks and folds is he, " Thence Nomius named, the herdsman's joy;
" Agreus by swains the chase that love, " And Phœbus and eternal Jove."
Thus Chiron spoke.
The God his words inspire
The nuptial rite to speed, and crown his great desire.
Swift are the movements of celestial minds,
And short the path their wills descry;
That hour the bond of rapture binds ;
In Libya's golden bower they lie.
There the bright walls for games* renown'd Still prospering boast her guardian love :
Conquering the while in Pythons grove
The son of proud Carneades hath bound Her brows with glory's wreath, aloud her name Proclaimed :
—him then in all her streets
With all her beauteous dames she greets, Bearing from Delphi's peak the rapturous prize of fame.
tBoundless is virtue's praise :
yet he that wooes
The wise, with sparing blazon will supply
The abundant theme, while opportunity, That perfects all things, curbs the excursive Muse.
This Ioläus practised well, As oft seven-portull'd Thebes shall tell:
He for one day from death returned, With his choice blade's dispatchful thrust Eurystheus pierced ;
again inurn'd, Slept with his godlike grandsire's dust, The charioteer Amphitryon;
Who, on Cadmëan friendships thrown, Within the adopted walls where Thebans ride
The milk-white warrior horse, illustrious stranger, died.
*Mingling in dalliance high with him and Jove, At one great birth two mighty sonst of yore, Matchless in fight, the sage Alcmena bore.
Cold is the tardy tongue that will not move-
Not burn for Hercules to sing, Nor that beloved Dircëan spring Remember, from whose bubbling stream, With Iphicles, he drank.
For vows,
With many a trophy crown'd, to them The loud triumphal choir I'll rouse.
Ye warbling Graces, on this head Cease not your beams of song to shed, That tells what chaplets from Ægina's shore, And thrice from Nisus' mount Cyrenè's champion bore.
Thus, to renown, from mute obscurity, Struggling he rose.
Let friends proclaim, And rivals too, if such there be, His labours for his country's fame !
Still keep the watery seer's* behest.
That bids our veriest praises flow E'en for the virtues of a foe.
Oft at the great Pentathlian † feast
The fair beheld thee crown'd with victory ;
And each her wish in silence gave
That Telesicrates the brave Were but her darling son, or noble spouse might be;
Crown'd in the Olympic sports, the heroic shows
Of ample-bosom'd earth, and every game Known in Cyrenè,—thy forefather's name Yet claims some brief memorial ere we close (Though almost quench'd our thirst of song), To tell how erst the suitor throng, Lured by the Libyan damsel's fame, Antæus' daughter, beauteous-hair'd, With brave pretence and various claim, To fair Irasa's‡towers repair'd.
Her with vain vows her courteous kin Chiefs of high note had woo'd to win;
Her many a fond aspiring stranger sought, For nature in her form its loveliest work had wrought.
Fain would they pluck the blooming fruit that crown'd
Her golden youth's sweet blossom :
but her sire Ties more august, and loftier hopes inspire.
He from sage lips and time-vouch'd tales had found How erst in Argos, ere the Still Half his diurnal race had run, For eight and forty virgins* each Danäus a youthful spouse embraced ;
Within the Stadium's listed reach
How all the blushing train he placed, While heralds loud to all proclaim
The plan and prizes of the game, Wherein each panting hero might decide, As each in speed excell'd, the fortune of his bride.
Thus for his daughter fair the Libyan sire Fit spousal found.
Her envied place
Fast by the goal, in rich attire, He fix'd, to close and crown the race. "
To him whose passing speed," he said, " Her veil first gains, the prize be due."
Foremost Alexidamus flew,
And by her yielded hand in triumph led Through troops of Nomads t his accomplish'd spouse :
They from their steeds with transport new Fresh leaves and flowers upon him threw, While plumes of conquest past hung graceful round his brows.
BLEST are Sparta's warlike sons !
Blest,
Thessaly, art thou !
Their race
The lords of both your thrones From one great sire, the brave Alcides, trace.
Ill-season'd sounds the boastful tale :
But, hark !
the shouts from Pytho's vale, From Pelinnæum, † and the plain Throng'd with Aleuas' sons, aloud require In great Hippocleas' praise th' applauding lyre To strike the eternal strain.
He with rapture tastes the games ;
Him, at Parnassus' shady base, Th' Amphictyon host ‡proclaims First of the youths that ran the double race.
Men, great Apollo, ne'er employ
The plans or means that end in joy Unquicken'd by the inspiring god :
*
Aided by thee this glorious deed was done;
And one in spirit as in blood the son His father's steps has trod.
For twice the Olympian wreath, Loaded with ponderous arms, the warrior's guiso, Phricias entwined;
again beneath Where Cirrha'st ramparts rise High o'er the turf the crown of speed he gains.
Long may kind Fortune with unaltered power On son and sire, while life remains, Her amplest bounties shower.
Sharing thus no scant supply
Of the best gifts that Greece bestows, May no sad destiny, No god with envious change their transport close I Heaven's love still guard them !
Blest is he, Worthiest to wake the minstrelsy, That warms the record of the wise, Who with stout arm and persevering speed
In fight or race transcends, and for his meed Takes virtue's noblest prize ;
Lives to see for conflict won The Pythian braid by Justice given Wave on his youthful son.
'Tis not for man to climb the brazen heaven :
* They on the farthest fairest beach
The bark of mortal life can reach Through dangers braved their sails display.
But who with venturous course through wave or waste To Hyperborean t haunts and wilds untraced E'er found his wondrous way ?
There Perseus press'd amain, And midst the feast enter'd their strange abode ;
Where hecatombs of asses slain To soothe the radiant god Astounded he beheld.
Their rude solemnities, Their barbarous shouts Apollo's heart delight:
Laughing the rampant brutes he sees Insult the solemn rite.
Still their sights, their customs strange Scare not the Muse ;
while all around
The dancing virgins range, And melting lyres and piercing pipes resound.
With braids of golden bays entwined
Their soft resplendent locks they bind, And feast in bliss the genial hour :
Nor foul disease, nor wasting age, Visit the sacred race ;
nor wars they wage, Nor toil for wealth or power.
*Thus revenge and force they shun
That push by Justice.
Such the spot Which Danae's daring son, Led by Minerva's hand, unrivall'd, sought.
To the blest realm in haste he flew, His arm the monstrous Gorgon slew, Whose hideous head with tresses dire Of grisly serpents to Seriphos' shore, Petrific death, his punctual vengeance bore.t
When gods the deed inspire,Though hard and strange it sound, I listen and believe the amazing tale.
Now stay thine oar;
and to the ground Safe from the threatening gale, And rock that lurks beneath, thy trusty anchor lower, 'Tis thus the choice encomiastic lay, Like the wild bee from flower to flower, Preserves its wandering way.
When by Peneus' echoing shore
The tribe of Ephyré* shall throng
These dulcet notes to pour;
Hippocleas' self shall brighten from the song, rake, while fresh crowns his temples, grace, Amongst his peers the worthiest place, Win e'en the slow respect of age, And warm the virgin breast with soft desire :
For various ties, as love or fame inspire, Our mortal hearts engage.
He that holds his hope's reward, The present bliss by heaven supplied With liveliest care will guard;
For hours to come no wisdom can provide.
Thorax, mine host, my cordial friend, Has lured my lyre its chords to lend
And wake for him this gracious measure.
"Twas he my four Pierian coursers join'd To their bright car, and woo'd my willing mind To make his wish its pleasure.
By trial hearts sincere are touch'd,
And proved like gold upon the Lydian stone ;
*
Then let my praise his brothers share, For virtues all their own.
They the Thessalian law with upright hand sustain :
Thus by paternal rule great cities rise;
'Tis from the good their wealth they gain, Their vigour from the wise.
DAUGHTER of Cadmus,* Semelé,
That dwell'st in heaven the Olympian queens among, And thou that in the chambers of the sea Sleep'st, Ino, with the Nereids haste along, Join'd with the hero-teeming dame that bare Great Hercules, to Melia'st golden shrine, Glittering with tripods rare, -By Loxias‡ honour'd most, his treasury divine :
That seat of truth oracular
He gave his loved Ismenian name to grace;
Thither, ye children of Harmonia fair,§
He calls your native choir and heroine race
Of ancient Themis, || in becoming strain, To sing, when Eve hath her dun sail unfurl'd, And Pytho's sacred plain, And Delphi's warning cell, the centre of the world.
So shall your grateful transports hail Seven-portall'd Thebes, and Cirrha's vale, Where Thrasydæus his proud country named,* Third of his line that won the golden braid
In the rich field of Pyladest proclaim'd, Whose friend Orestes Lacedæmon‡ sway'dHim from the slaughter of his sire
By stealth his nurse Arsinöe snatch'd away, Th' unnatural search to shun and baleful ire Of Clytemnestra, on that fatal day When old Dardanian Priam's captive maid, Beauteous Cassandra, her relentless hand, With Agamemnon's shade, By one fell stroke despatched to Acheron's dismal strand.
Merciless dams !
what pang so keen Stung thy revenge to dare so dread a deed ?
Was't to requite thy injured Iphigene On black Euripus'* shore condemn'd to bleed ?
Or was 't the midnight couch thy soul betrayed, E'en while thou wantonedst in the stranger's arms, With deadlier guilt to shade
The ne'er-forgotten crime that stain'd thy faithless charms ?
Alas !
it dwells on every tongue ;
For ill report delights the throng, And envy on distinction ever waits;
While he that breathes life's humblest destiny Slanders unheeded.
Thus Amyclæ's gates,†
At length return'd, beheld Atrides die :
—Die with him the prophetic maid Saved from the flames and wreck of plunder'd Troy, Which he for Helen's guilt in ashes laid.
Meanwhile to Strophius the sequester'd boy, His ancient host that by the sacred base Of old Parnassus dwelt, unknown withdrew ;
Thence grown to manhood's grace, Arm'd on his mother rose, and foul Ægistheus slew.
Mark how my truant song hath stray'd
From the straight path its outset had design'd, Like traveller vague by crossing track betray'd
Or some sea-labouring vessel, which the wind Has drifted from its course.
Resume thy way,
If thou in truth, my Muse, hast pledged for hire
Thy mercenary lay :
For other strains, I trow, must tremble on thy lyreStrains that for feats in Pytho's Games Phricias* or Thrasydaeus claims, Where glory spreads the beams of gladness round ;
They on the chariot swift, and pressing steed Far-famed of yore, with radiant conquest crown'd, Bore from th' Olympian cirque the palms of speedStripp'd of their arms in Pytho's field, They on the Stadium enter'd j far behind Hosts of Hellenians to their swiftness yield.
Be mine on heaven's great gifts to fix my mind, Restraining still youth's wishes to its power :
For marking that with men in lowly state Enjoyment's happier hour Largest remains, I spurn the pleasures of the great.
My praise the humbler virtues claim ;
+
The rich still rue the envy they excite :
Yet he that by desert advanced to fame Meekly his greatness wears, nor from that height With insolence looks down, at last shall find E'en in death's gates the beams of comfort shine, And leave a name behind, Life's richest, best bequest to grace an honoured line.
Thus Ioläus,* noble son Of Iphicles, distinguish'd shone ;
And Castor and great Pollux jointly swell, Offspring of gods, the Muse's minstrelsy:
To-day by turns Therapne'st dismal cell
They share ;
to-morrow lifts them to the sky.
LOVER of glory, fairest queen
Of cities raised by human skill, That dwell'st beside the margent green
Of flock-frequented Agragas,* High on the temple-crested hill
The fair Proserpine's t chosen place;
Accept with favouring look, the while Mortals and gods propitious smile, The wreath I bring from Pytho's shrine Round Midas' glorious locks to twine :
Midas, in sage Minerva's art Above all Greeks his matchless part Conquering perform'd, with instrumental tone The Gorgons' cries to mock and loud lamenting moan.
‡Such their wild woes and melting whine, When Perseus with his radiant sword 'Reft of the third the sisters trine;
Such, mingling with the deafening sound, Pour'd from the twisting snakes abhorr'd
That yell'd their virgin brows around.
Dooming old Phorcus'* race divine
In darkness and dismay to pine, He to Seriphos' sea-girt shore
Her peoples death triumphant bore :
Erst an unwelcome empty guest At Polydectes' fatal feast, He now avenged with fair Medusa's head His mother's charms enslaved and compulsory bedFor he was Danäe's progeny, Sprung, as they tell, from golden shower Spontaneous dropping from the sky.
Him thus from peril snatch'd, the loud Melodious pipes with various power
The virgin's heavenly hand endow'd ;
That so the mimic instrument, With warbled screams and feign'd lament, Might yield, Euryale, the note Wrung from thy shrill-bewailing throat.
The rare discovery thus by Heaven For mortal recreation given, Her “ many-headed mood "t th' inventress names, The people's signal sweet that warns them to the games.
Through vocal vent its music flows
Of brass with slender reed combined
That near the festive city* grows,
Where with light step the Graces move, Marking the measured dance they wind In cool Cephisus' flowery grove.
Whate'er success mankind achieves, 'Tis toil alone the blessing gives;
And fortune's breath the self-same day Oft blows the short-lived flower away.
'Tis not for man th' appointed doom To shun.
The hour to all shall come
That brings what hope foretastes not, and bestows Boons of unpromised bliss or unsuspected woes.
HALLOW'D goal † of Alpheus' race, Ortygia, flower of noble Syracuse, Diana's natal place.
Sister of Delos,‡ from thy fount the Muse Her sweetly-warbled numbers speeds, With praise to deck the tempest-paced steeds, And please Ætnæan Jove.§ Chromius' car and Nemea's plain
To crown his conquest bid us move
The loud encomiastic strain.
Lo !
the victor's virtues rise
And strike the mansions of the go s above.
In Fortune's region lies Glory's bright summit, where the Muses love Proud games and champions to record.
Now for that isle* which erst th' Olympian lord On Proserpine bestow'd, Strike the lyre :
his azure locks t
He shook, and gave th' assuring nod That, crown'd with fruitful fields‡ and flocks,And gorgeous cities, to the skies Sicilians fattening hills should rise.
The son of Saturn gave beside A race that burns in brazen arms to guide
The war-horse to the field ;
that round its brow Th' Olympian chaplet's golden gleam Hath oft displayed.
The shaft of truth I throw And boundless is my theme.
In the porch of Chromius' hall Honour'd I stand, warbling th' applausive lay, And at his bounteous call Share the rich banquet.
Many a festive day
That board the welcome stranger knows :
His virtues mar the slanders of his foes, And quench like flood the flame.
Various arts mankind delight;
But he that tempts the field of Fame Must march with Nature to the fight.
Strength its might by action shows;
The mind by thought and sure sagacity ;
As heaven each gift bestows.
Son of Agesidamus, both in thee Their blended energies unfold.
Cursed be the useless heap of hoarded gold !
My stores my friend must share :
Bounteous affluence buys renown,
When her full hands with general care
The hopes of labouring virtue crown.
'Tis thus with Chromius, from whose praise I pass to tales of ancient days
For like examples bright, and seize
The youthful feats of matchless Hercules.
How, from his parent's womb the pangs of birth Escaped, Jove's infant offspring lay, And with his twin-born brother struggling forth, Gazed on the dazzling day :
How by Juno not unseen
The saffron swathe his infant members pent;
Whereat th' indignant queen
Of the high gods two furious serpents sent.*
Through the wide gates with many a fold
They to the dark and spacious chamber roll'd,
Their jaws with slaver smear'd, Ravening for their infant prey :
Stirr'd at the sound, his front he rear'd,
And roused him for the maiden fray.
Round their necks in durance sure
With gripe inevitable his hands he clasp'd ;
Till time their sprites impure Press'd from the strangled monsters as he grasp'd :
Mean while with terror petrified Stood the fair train that by Alcmena's side
Their soft attendance gave ;
Frantic from her painful bed, She all unshod, her babes to save From those foul foes, unclothed had fled.
Forthwith the Theban chiefs alarm'd, In brazen arms around them swarm'd j
And first the brave Amphitryon, With brandish'd faulchion from the scabbard drawn, Rush'd breathless in, with pang parental stung :
Thus each his own afflictions tear, While all, with cheek soon cheer'd, and heart unwrung, Their neighbour's sufferings bear.
Fix'd in wonder's stiffening trance, Jov-struck he stood, the dauntless infant's might First bursting on his glance, And all the tale forged by his menials' fright
Thus cancell'd by the powers above.
Forthwith the peerless priest of highest Jove Tiresias'* tents he sought, Truth's unerring prophet, sage :
He to th' assembled warriors taught
The fortunes of that infant's age ;
Told, what monsters of the waste, What foes to justice on the infested tide His mortal stroke should taste ;
What wrong, when hard oppression leagued with pride, His deadliest vengeance should sustain ;
How, when the immortal powers on Phlegra's plain With earth's gigantic crewt War should wage, as wage they must, His sharp impetuous darts should strew Their locks illustrious in the dust.
He told, how thus for pains below
His soul eternal peace should know, Celestial bliss ;
his toils receive
The richest prize rewarding gods can give, To dwell within the mansions of the blest, Seated with Jove in beauty's bloom, While yielding Hebe crown'd his nuptial feast
In heaven's empyreal dome.
As bards, that soar on Homer's wing, With prologue of Jove's sounding praise Begin their rhapsodies to sing ;
So he that swells my lays
The base and prelude of his fame, And prowess in the sacred game, Hath laid within the grove And far-famed cirque of Nemean Jove.
*Yet oft, if right-directing time Dooms him th' Athenian name to grace, And gives him, like his sire, to climb
The steeps of glory's race, With conquering hand Timonöus' son Shall pluck, from Isthmian contests won, The fairest wreaths they yield,- Oft rise victorious from the Pythian field.
For when the mountain Pleiads † glow, Soon shall Orion's baldrick ‡ blaze, And Salamis§ hath power, I trow, A champion chief to raise :
Let Hector tell, how many a tongue In Troy the name of Ajax rung ;
And, Timodeme, thy might Shines courage-proof in the Pancratian fightFrom earliest age Acharnæ’s* dames Have rear'd a race for valour famed :
How oft hath conquest at the games A Timodeme proclaimed !
They from the crowded plain below Parnassus' towering throne of snow Four splendid victories bore ;
They from Corinthian rivals, on the shoreWhere virtuous Pelopst ruled of yore, Eight chaplets wrung;
their temples crown d From Nemea seven, from Athens more Than number's reach can bound, Gain'd in Jove's games ;
whose praise supreme, Join'd with triumphant Timodeme, Ye native choirs display- Begin, begin the sweet melodious lay.
COME, heavenly muse, the mother of my song, To fair Ægina’s Dorian sile,* With many a stranger throng'd, the while Nemea's high games the sacred moon prolong ;
— Come, for behold from far the youthful band, Framing their sweet triumphal air, By old Asopus' banks t to hear Thy dulcet voice impatient stand.
To various meeds man's various toils aspire;
But most the conquering Athlete burns
For the rich lay, that wakes the lyre, And waits on Virtue's steps, weaving the wreath she earns :
Whereof no scant supply, no lingering stream, Daughter of Jove, that rules on high The cloudy muster of the sky, Pour from these lips to match my pregnant theme.
Thus to their tuneful throats and quivering strings
Th' effectual hymn my soul shall give, And bid their nation's glory live :
Whose ancient tribes and godlike kings, Whose Myrmidonian sires* with dastard's part Aristoclides ne'er hath shamed ;
With no faint arm, no recreant heart, The rough Pancratium faced, the sturdiest champion tamed.
But Victory's soothing hand can heal
The blows conflicting heroes feel, And bring from Nemea's blooming plain
The joyful balm of every pain.
If then with manliest beauty graced, And rich in deeds that form to suit, The son of Aristophanes bath placed On glory's loftiest peak his daring foot, There must he pause :
'tis no mean task to brave Beyond th' Herculean rocks t th' unnavigable wave :
Rocks, which the hero-god stupendous piled, His proud memorial, to display The limit of his wondrous way.
He the huge monsters of the billowy wild Subdued ;
the lakes, the tides that flood the sound, His keen spontaneous search explored-
Proved every pass, and fount, and ford, Adventure's goal and Nature's bound :
—
Whither, my spirit, to what alien strand Veer'at thou my course ?
thy wandering lays
The sons of Æacus* demand :
'Tis justice crowns the muse that glows in virtue's praiseNot from the stranger's store, the distant spring, Her amplest cup Encomium fills :
Draw thou from rich Ægina’s rills
The sweet, the glorious theme she bids thee sing.
There Peleus old in feats of bravery shone ;
With ponderous lance himself had fell'd, By no compeer, no host upheld, Alone Iolcus' walls ✝ he won—
Won to his arms the mistress of the wave.‡
Hence too the mighty Telamon, Comrade of Iolas the brave, Troy's perjured king § subdued, and broke his barbarous throne.
With him the realms, where 'gainsb the foe Th' Amazons bend the brazen bow, He vanquish'd.
Fear, that quells mankind, Stay'd not his ardent constant mind.
Such power hath he, whose bosom burns, By Nature touched, with glory's fire ;
While Art's weak child still shifts, as frailty urns
His obscure path ;
by no sublime desire, No steadfast step sustained, his wavering soul Tries every virtue's taste, yet dares not drain the bowLMark now the part divine Achilles play'd !
While Philyra* yet with watchful eye O'erlook'd his home-kept infancy, E'en then men's feats his childish sports he made.
Poising with infant hand the barbed lance, Full oft the lion's wrathful might, Swift as the wind, he match’d in fight;
Oft faced the bristling boar's advance, And at old Chiron's feet exulting laid, Scarce six years born, his panting prey.
Thence on his youth the Delian maid, The stern Minerva, smiled, and cheer'd his wondrous way.
He with no treacherous toils the doe beguiled, With no dull brach her track pursued ;
His dazzling pace, as legends rude Vouch the free tale, her bounding footstep foil'd.
Within that rock-roof d mansion long before Jason the sapient Centaur rear'd, And gentler Æsculapius heard Soft-handed Medicine's healing lore.
He bade bright Thetis in her fruitful arms A hero's mortal form enfold ;
The unrivall'd son that crown'd her charms
With wisdom's wealth he stored, and shaped in virtue's mould ;
That, when to Troy's beleaguer'd plain His bending sail should thwart the main Th' accomplish'd youth might bravely stand War’s onset wild, the gleaming brand, The clashing spear (though Lycian shout, Dardans and Phrygians, swell'd the alarm), And, rushing on the javelin'd Æthiop’s rout, Pour all his heart into his vigorous arm-
That Memnon, their fierce prince, might sail no more, With Helenus* though leagued, to Nile's lamenting shore.
From him th' Æacean race, with brightest ray, To distant climes and ages shine :
—
Jove, are they not thy seed divine ?
Thine the great games, which now, with rapt'rous lay
By youthful warblers breath'd, their country's fame Blazoning, I sing ;
—with victory crown'd Aristoclides swells the sound, And gives their isle's illustrious name, Her Pythian Pontiff proud, and awful shrine, On Memory's pictured roll to live.
Thus high deserts by trial shine j
Thus men by deeds compared their true distinctions give.
Boys among boys by various feats surpass;
Youth copes with youth ;
maturer age Its own appropriate arts engage.
Such are the stages of our mortal race ;
A fourth yet follows—life’s declining day ;
This too its powers, its blessings yields, Whereof no stint bath he, and gilds Calm virtue's close with wisdom's ray.
Farewell, farewell !-to thee, my valiant friend, These milk-drops, mix'd with honey dews, My soft mellifluous lays, I send, Pour'd from the Æolian pipe-the nectar of the Muse .
Too long delay’d—but through the skies Swiftest of fowl the eagle flies;
Lured from afar he sails away, And pounces on his mangled prey;
While with hoarse croak and timorous flight
The inglorious jackdaw* courts the ground.
Meanwhile, on thee, as, from her throne of light, Clio thy prowess hails with victory crown'd, From Epidaurian groves, t and Megara's shore, And Nemea's shouting field, the beams of glory pour.
TOIL that conquering virtue bears Joy's sweet balsam's best allay And song, the Muses’ daughter, cheers With her soft touch and soothing lay.
The bath's warm waves not so reclaim, So rouse the champion's fainting frame, As praises bland his soul inspire, Warbled on truth's delightful lyre :
Her everlasting word survives
The doer and the deed, When graceful genius largely gives From wisdom's deepest fount the living meed.
Now to Saturn's son divine, Timasarch, and Nemea's field, Field of the wrestler's fame, be mine
The encomiastic song to yield ;
Worthy the tower-crown'd citadels Where Æacus’ high lineage dwells ;
*
Where, friend with stranger mix'd, on all
The beams of equal justice fall.
Oh ! if Timocritus thy sire Still view'd th' all-cheering day, How would he strike the various lyre, And wake the string to our triumphal lay !
How the golden wreaths resound, Won from famed Cleonæ’s fray;
* From glorious Athens, and the ground
Where sev’n bright portals front the day For, where Amphitryon's proud remains Inurn’dth' illustrious tomb contains, Cadmæan chiefs, with willing hand, Twined round his brows the glittering band :
Fondly they swell'd Ægina’s fame ;
For, welcome to that wall, By friends received a friend he came,‡ And sat in great Alcides' gorgeous hall.
Telamon* with him repell'd Merop routt and Phrygian band;
With him the warrior-giant quell'd, Alcyoneus,‡ whose wasteful hand Twelve chariots, that with coursers four Each to the field two heroes bore, With a rock's fragment whirl'd around Had dash'd promiscuous to the ground.
Ill hath he read war's woeful page, Ne'er tried ambition's race, Who learns not from this lesson sage
How vauntful victory speeds but to disgrace.
All their glorious deeds to tell Lyric law forbids the string :
—
Time urges, and some potent spell Lures me the new-moon sports to sing.
Quit, roving muse, the tempting tale, And in mid sea reverse thy sail;
Transcendant thus o'er all thy foes.
Its day thy glorious orb shall close ;
While he, that plots thy spotless fame With envious glance to wound, Rolls in the dark the glimmering flame
Of his weak rage, that sinks into the ground.
Me whatever the part, the powers, Sovereign Fate hath doom'd to hold, Full well I know the circling hours Shall prove and perfect and unfold.
Weave then with speed, my dulcet lyre, Thy richest woof, my sours desire, Th' harmonious mood of Lydian measure, Œnone’s* pride and Cyprus' pleasure ;
—
There Teucer rears his distant throne;
Here, midst his father's fields, The mightier son of Telamon His Salaminian sceptre Ajax wields.
Glittering in the Euxine main, Leuce's isle Achilles sways ;
To Thetis bows the Phthian swain ;
Pyrrhus th' Epirote tract obeys, Whose rock-strew'd range and cultured head, With herds and fattening pastures spread, From dark Dodona's waving steep Breaks westward on the Ionian deep.
Iolcus old, whose walls embower’d
By shady Pelion rose, Peleus with hostile hand o'erpower'd, And gave enthrall’d to her Hæmonian foes :
Weak Acastus' wily spouse*
On their realm that vengeance brought-
Such rage a wanton's wrongs could rouse :
Him Pelias' son, with treachery fraught And axe Dædalian, by the way In ambush dark had lurk'd to slay ;
By Chiron saved, eftsoon to prove
The splendid destiny of Jove.
Unscared, the fierce all-conquering fire, The lion's strength he braves, His armed paws, his fangs and ire— Forms that disguised the mistress of the waves.
✝Love at length the Nereid bound ;
Peleus shares her golden throne :
From seas and skies their banquet round
The gods in glittering circle shone, And gave them of their grace divine Treasure and power to bless their line.
'Tis not for man the deeps to sound That rage beyond the Gadian bound :
‡ Turn thou tow'rds Europe's dreadless coast
Thy helm and venturous sail;
The sons of Æacus can boast Deeds which no strain can reach, no time detail.
Herald of th' athletic fray Fought in famed Olympia's vale, In demean grove and Isthmian bay, The brave Theandrian tribe I hail.
There the nerve-strengthening toil they plied, 'Gainst rivals brave their prowess tried, Nor bore not to their native bowers
The wreath that blooms with glory's flowers.
There, foremost of the tuneful choir, To chant the victor's praise
The tribe of Timasarch * aspire.
If yet for Calliclest thou bidd'st me raisePillars of eternal mould, Brighter than the Parian mine, Know that great deeds, like glittering gold Purged in the fire, more brightly shine
In the warm song when genius sings, And makes inferior mortals kings.
Oh !
could his shade, that dwells below Where Acheron's wailing waters flow, These cheering strains delighted hear Sounding the boastful day When at loud Neptune's games he bare From Corinth's choicest chiefs her crown away IHim long since with willing lay Euphanes, thy father's sire, Sung, as the heroes of his day Each minstrel's glowing lips inspire :
For well the gifted hand can write
The vivid records of the sight:
Like his that binds unrivall'd now With wreaths of skill Melesias' brow.*
Unmaster'd in the lists of song
His might each champion throws ;
Mild to the good, but, roused by wrong, Rough and revengeful on his recreant foes.
I AM no sculptor to display Statues of silent stone, that in one place Stand motionless upon their idle base, Unknown.
Speed thou, my dulcet lay,
In every bark and pinnace o'er the deep From loud Ægina’s echoing steep Spreading this tale the world around—
How Lampon's valiant son, Pythias, with wreath Pancratian crown'd, In Nemea's grove the palm of strength has won.
Youth on his lip hath not yet blown
Her earliest bloom of mantling down ;
Yet hath this stripling glorified Warriors and heroes from the golden love Of Nereids sprung, and Æacus, and Jove, And Saturn ;
* blazon'd far and wide His capital, the stranger's throng'd resort;
Whose populous walls and masted port Endaïs’ glorious sons of yore, With kingly Phocus (born Beside th' abrupt resounding shore Of Psamathè divine, in cave forlorn), Founded and bless'd, and gave to ride, With many a prow, the wondering tide.
tSuppliant for this, at Jove's Hellenian shrine‡
They stood, and raised their hands to heaven :
— I tremble to disclose what wrath divine Th' illustrious pair, to exile driven, Forced from the favour'd isle ! *
A deed,
By no just ire, no mastering need, Provoked—hold, hold, my lips, th' unwelcome tale :
Sage truth, that yields not to dismay, Oft shades her blushing cheek in caution's veil :
Oft silence best secures discretion's blameless way,But when brave wealth, or manly might, Or praise of iron war demands my song, Dig me the venturous chasm, profound and long, And my light limbs with easy flight Shall leap the tempting peril.
Eagles fling
O'er the broad sea the daring wing.
Yet e'en for these, in happier day,✝ The muses' beauteous choir Spontaneous moved, their heavenly lay On Pelion's mountain sung :
the sev'n-tongued lyre With golden wand Apollo strook, And all th' eternal numbers woke.
First above all, in loftiest strain, Th' immortal name of Sovereign Jove they sung ;
Majestic Thetis next, of Nereus sprung, And Peleus chaste, whose virtue's stain The false Hippolyta plann’d—adulterous queen ! ‡
She, with feign'd fears and plaints obscene, Her duped uxorious spouse, that fill’d Magnesia's potent throne, T' adopt her treacherous tale beguiled-
Her base invented charge-,, how all alone, " On his own couch, his helpless bride “By force the ruffian prince had tried.
"Twas all the truth reversed-the fraud of lust.
With fervent prayers, avow’d desires, Oft had she press'd him ;
but his stern disgust, His rage the bold proposal fires.
The wrath of hospitable Jove* He fear'd, and spurn'd th' unholy love.
Jove from his cloudy throne, heaven's ruling lord, Mark’d the just youth, and for his bride Gave him the Nereïd queen, his truth's reward, That deep in crystal cave the golden distaff plied.
Neptune with smiles the nuptial meets, Though mortal :
he from Ægæ’s thundering bayt Oft to the Dorian Isthmus speeds away, Where many a band his coming greets With hymns and clarions loud, and cheering cries, While strength contests th' heroic prize, Won as the natal guardian power*
Each champion's lot decrees ;
That erst in proud Œnonè’s bowel Gave to thy might, renown'd Euthymenes.
In victory's heavenly arms embraced, The high-wrought hymns of praise to tasteSprung from the same maternal seed, See thy bold steps the youthful Pytbias trace, Beaming his glory's rays on all his race :
Nemea beheld his daring deed, And the fair month Delphiniant Phœbus loves.
Him, midst Ægina's echoing groves, By Nisus' ‡ vale-cleft mountain dark His ill-starr'd rivals fly :
—
Oh !
how it joys my soul to mark
Each generous state in feats of bravery vie !
Know, 'twas Menander's§ art prepared
Thy fortune's way, thy toil's reward :
Athens alone the master hands can bring Th' aspiring Athlete's skill to frame :
—
Wouldst thou with these the brave Themistius sing ?||
Speak boldly:
shrink not from his name;
E'en to the topmast hoist away
The swelling canvass of thy lay :
Him pugilist–Pancratiast him proclaim;
In Epidaurus twice renown'd
He hears the blended chaplets of his fame Back to th' Æacean shrine, by all the Graces crown'd.
MEN and the Gods above one race compose :
Both from the general parent Earth Derive their old mysterious birth :
But powers unlike their differing nature shows;
-- Man breathes his moment, and is nought;
While, like their brazen heaven's eternal base, Gods live for ever :
yet th' illumined face, Th' illustrious form, th' aspiring thought, Proclaim him kindred of the skies, Though fate conceals from reason's eyes, Whether night frowns, or noontide glows, What course we run;
what goal the race shall ciosoE'en now the brave Alcimedes displays A cognate port, a soul like theirs.
He, like the field, that sometimes bears
From the quick seed, which genial culture layg, Life-fostering fruits, and crops of gold, But when th' alternate season bids abstain, The fallow sleeps refresh'd, and teems again ;
Thus he, 'mong Nemea's chiefs enroll'd, Of his proud race relumes the fire
That slumber'd in his nameless sire :
While Jove his destined progress leads, With fearless foot his grandsire's steps he treads,Finding, like hurter true, the place
Where worth might win the wrestler's crown, By the sure track of old Praxidamas.
The verdant plant, by Alpheus grown, First from the Olympian cirque he bore To bloom on fair Ægina's shore :
Three Nemean braids his locks imbow'd ;
Five Isthmian choirs his triumphs sung;
Till Agesimachus beheld the cloud Disperse, that round his son, the tame Socleides, hung.
Thus these three champions* of one generous line Mounted by virtue's toilsome ways, And reach'd the topmost peaks of praise.
Fortune, by man's best help, Jove's will divine, Prosper'd their house :
to none beside, From all the games which spacious Greece supplies, E'er fell so largely given the boxer's prize.
Great though the task-this hand shall guide
Right home, I trow, with archer's art, To the bright scope its sounding dart.
Breathe thou, my Muse, thy glorious breeze Full on the sails of brave Alcimedes.
Praised are the deeds of those that are no more :
The minstrel's lyre, the rhetor's tongue, Hath told their tale, their chant hath sueg Whereof the Bassian tribe no scanty store Hath bless'd :
full freights*
in happier days
Of rich renown they bought with noble deeds, Harvests of hymns, which from celestial seeds Pierian swains profusely raise.
Thence Callias sprung, a champion proves
By both Latona's twins beloved;
Round his stout wrist the cest Ϯ he wove, And pluck'd the crown from Pytho's sacred grove.
Thence by Castalia's murmuring spring, When eve had closed the martial game, Like her bright star, he burnt amidst the ring Of Graces choir'd to sound his fame.
Him next at Neptune's Isthmian shrine, The bridge that parts his restless brine, ‡ Where slaughter'd bulls triennial fall, Th' Amphictyons honour’d :
round ais head, Where Phlius rears* his dark primeval wall, The rough-maned lion's plant its crisped foliage spread, tWide is the gate, and various are the ways Through which, this glorious isle to grace, The pomp of poesy may pass :
For there unfailing founts of purest praise
The race of Æacus supplies- (Praise, the reward-the heroic virtue's gain) :
Through all the peopled earth, the trackless main, Spread far and wide their glory flies;
It leapt beyond the Libyan shore, When Memnon's might return'd no more;
For no tame sport, no mimic war Was his, when swift Achilles from his carCame threatening down, and with his angry spear, Though sprung from bright Aurora's womb, Despatch'd him to the dusky tomb.
Such are the tales old times were proud to hear :
These are the public paths of song, Through which my course with ardent steps I keep, And though, when dangers crowd the stormy deep, The wave that bursts the shrouds among Most moves the labouring seaman's fear, My back the twofold load shall bear, While thus with willing steps I trace
The past and present triumphs of the race :
For from the sacred games, that gave His godlike sires their just renown, Alcimedes, fit offspring of the brave, Hath earn'd the five-and-twentieth crown.
Two more to Timidas* and thee The lots' precarious destiny In Jove's Olympian grove denied.
Yet let my song Melesias Ϯ name ;
Prompt, as the dolphin on the billowy tide, Your boisterous strength he trains, and guides you to the game.
DAUGHTER of powerful Juno that dost cheer, Throned by the deep-foreboding destinies, The labouring birth, chaste ilithyia,‡ hear :
Without thy aid nor day, nor midnight skies, We view-nor youth in strength's proportions fair Thy sister Hebe's* season reach.
Yet all not one pursuit, one passion share;
Life hath its several yoke for each :
Mark how Thearion's late-born son, Stout Sogenes, through thee begun Virtue's distinguish'd race ;
and loud renown
In circling songs proclaims his fresh Pentathlian crowr.
For ’mongst the sons of Æacus he dwells :
They love the clanging spear, the warlike lay;
They hail the aspiring heart, that pants and swells
For the rough game, that courts the trying fray ;
For whom the willing Muse mellifluous winds
Her warbling stream.
–’Tis darkness all When bravery no recording minstrel finds, ‡ Then valorous deeds reflected fall
On the bright mirror's burnish'd plane, When inspiration's mindful strain Toil's everlasting recompense bestows, And round the embellish'd gift her rich embroidery throws.
The wise, content not with life's present store, To the fair breeze that shall hereafter blow, Like prudent seamen, look.
The rich, the poor, Alike to death's dark tomb must go :
Then how in song their names shall shine Enhanced, let famed Ulysses show;
His woes, I ween;
more brightly glow In sweetest Homer's words and rhapsody divine :
Round whose enchanting tale a sacred charm His winged art hath wound;
while genius deigns Beguile us with bewitching fictions warm, For vulgar eyes truth's radiant image strains :
Could they her beams behold without disguise, Ne'er had the senseless sentence press'd Proud Ajax, for the lost celestial prize, To pierce his own indignant breast;
* Ajax, the fierce Achilles slain, Mightiest of all the boastful train Whose barks the west wind wafted o'er the tide From Phrygian force to wrest the frail all-beauteous bride.
Still, though death's wave without distinction roll
O'er all alike, the nameless and the great, For warriors yet, that reach th' eternal goal, Approved of heaven, conspicuous honours wait.
Thus, when the towers of Troy, so long by Greeks Assail'd, brave Pyrrhus to the skies
In smouldering flames had whirl'd, the grove he seeks, In whose dark shades sequester'd lies
The spacious earth's mysterious nave, And shrines him in a Pythian grave.
Wandering from Ilion's shore his bark had crossed, Far off his native Scyre, Ϯ to Ephyra's distant coast.
ϮThere the Molossian realm awhile he sway'd, And many an age his sons the diadem wore :
Thence to the Delphian god not long delay'd
The first-fruits of his wars he bore-
The wealth of Ilion's wasted pride.
There for the plunder'd sacrifice, While his bold arm the priest defies, Fell‛d by a stranger's axe, great Priam's conqueror* diec.
Sore grieved the Delphian hosts that foul disgrace ;
Yet thus the debt of destiny he paid.
Fate had required that of the Æacian race, Within that ancient grove for ever laid, Fast by the gorgeous fane, a king should rest;
Whose hallow'd shade with vigil pure, When fuming offerings heap'd th' heroic feast, The pompous ritual might secure.
A word his rare desert rewards ;
True to his trust the rites he guards,
And fearless thus shall vouch-with virtue's ray Jove's and Ægina’s sons still light their glorious way.
Here let our praises pause-rest pleases all;
Suspensions due the choicest sweets improve ;
Sweet honey's self the satiate taste will pall;
Pall e'en the flowers of sweet luxurious love.
Nature, that gives us life, and fire, and frame, With different wills inspires the breast ;
Each feels his several impulse, none the same ;
None e'er with every bliss was blest ;
Perfection's lot–that ne'er shall gleam
In history's roll, or fancy's dream.
Yet what kind fate to thee, Thearion, sends, Comes with a gilded grace the wish'd occasion lends.
*Thine is the daring heart that throbs for fame, The mind where wisdom's beams unclouded play.
Doubt not the Muse ;
a stranger's faith I claim ;
No slander lurks in honour's lay :
But, pure and plenteous as the flood
That warbles from the limpid spring, My friend's unquestion'd praise I sing ;
'Tis virtue's earn’d return, the wages of the good.
Not e'en the Achæan chief,Ϯ whose mansion wild O'erhangs the Ionian wave, my strain shall blare e :
Our states in friendship mix;
with aspect mild And clear I greet my countrymen ;
my aim No forced extreme, no violent end pursues (So pass in peace my closing day) :
Challenge my dearest inmates, if my Muse To slander's lust e'er lent her lay.
0 Sogenes, whose generous race Th’ Euxenian tribe shall ne'er disgrace, Beyond truth's mark, I swear, my glowing tongue Flings not thy random praise, the javelin of her song.
Thou with unswelter'd neck, with limbs untired, Didst in thy gripe the wrestler's rage repress, Ere day's meridian flame thy limbs had fired ;
–
Toil, that but raised the raptures of success, Bear with my frenzy, if I rage and rave
When victory bids my pinion soar ;
'Tis the heart's grace ;
I grudge not for the brave To stake my spirit's wealthiest store.
No skill the vulgar chaplets ask ;
Reek not, my Muse, the unworthy task:
Thou, with rich ivory chased, thy golden crown Dost weave with choral flowers from fostering sea-dew blown.
But when thy Nemean hymn the praise of Jove Remembers, with soft hand thy glorious lyre
And touch chastised in modest numbers move.
On that famed isle the sceptred sire
Of all the gods with reverend voice Resound :
for there in happiest hour Ægina’s womb the genial power With Æacus impregn'd, and bade her rocks rejoice.
He thy paternal brother, and thine host, Great Hercules, first raised our country's fame *— Her prince and patron.
Oh !
if man may boast t Man's friendship ;
if, with hearts and hopes the same, A.ssociates dear in sweet fraternity Life's purest joys delighted share, And gods such bliss may taste ;
oh, then, with thee, Whose mastery quell'd the Titans' war, Brave Sogenes by fortune blest, While filial reverence warms his breast, Within these sacred walls, th' august retreat
Of all his affluent sires, will fix his favourite seat:
For as the parting pole on either hand Flanks the quadrigal chariot's gilded yoke, Between thy stately fanes his turrets stand.
Blest youth !
him sooth'd by thee with prospering look Jove and great Juno and the blue-eyed Maid Shall guard :
for, when disasters press, Oft helpless man thy prompt exertions aid.
Vouchsafe, benignant sire, to bless
His youth with power, his age with length
Of years, contentment, health, and strength ;
Vouchsafe the late descendants of his sons
Their father's fame shall share, augmenting as it runs.
But for myself ne'er shall my conscience say, Whate’er unheeded calumny may feign, That Neoptolemus my slanderous lay Deign'd with unjust reproach to stain;
-
But 'twere wit's weakness to disprove
The three-times-thrice refuted lie, To waste on wayward infancy The grandam's endless tale of “Corinth sprung from Jove."*HERALD of love's ambrosial joys, That on the lids of laughing boys
And bright-eyed maids dost sit, enchanting Youth 1 Whose heedless guidance, as the soul Unpractised feels thy wild control, Leads this to rapture, that to ruth :
–
Yet oh !
when opportunity, That warns all fortune's works to move, Gives the kind hour, how sweet to bo The lord of every virtuous love.
Such love, as round the genial bed For Jove and blest Ægina spread, Served the rich gifts voluptuous Venus brought :
Thence sprung the wise, the warlike son, Whose greatness graced CEnone's throne :
Thousands with prayers his presence sought;
Unforced, uncall’d, the pride and flower Of all the states that groan'd around,* Spontaneous to his hallow'd power Trusted their griefs, their welfare bound :
—Heroes and sapient seers, that sway'd The sage Athenians' rocky strand, And Pelops' sons by Spartan chiefs obey'd.
Thus for that favourite isle's heroic band
The reverend knees,! in suppliant guise, Of Æacus I clasp, and with me bring My Lydian wreath, of various minstrelsies, Round Deinis' brows and Megas' bust to fling–
Each for his Nemean race, the son's and father's prize :
Unfading joys to him are given
Whose fortune's seed is sown in heaven.
With hoards of wealth heaven's bounteous grace Loaded the Cyprian Cinyras:
* Breathe here, my Muse, and rest thy nimble feet-
Oft bath that various tale been told :
And perilous 'tis with fictions bold
The test of censure's glance to meet.
The adventurous bard is envy's prey-
Envy, that bravel y mounts the skies, Stoops not the pinion lools to slay, But makes her quarry of the wise.
'Twas envy's hand with frenzy's sword Th' indignant heart of Ajax gored.
Ungrac'd with eloquence, by weaker foes Defeated, valour sometimes flies
The wordy warfare, while the prize To varnish'd falsehood folly throws.
Thus duped the Greeks with lots conceal'd
The false Ulysses glorified;
Robb'd of his casque and golden shield Ajax himself assail'd and died.
Ah !
how unlike in war's rough hour
The blows they dealt, the blood they drew !
From their strain'd arms with what unequal pow'r
Against the conscious foe their javelins flew !
Strove they for great Achilles slam, Or join'd the slaughters of the general tray.
Thus used of old was flattery's hateful bane, Winning with wheedling words her treacherous way—
Artificer of fraud, man's mischief and his stain :
The great she levels, but to raise
The mouldering glory of the base.
O grant me of thy grace divine, Great Jove, such meanness ne'er be mine ;
Teach me through life truth's simple path to find, That my sons blush not for their sire.
Some showers of gold from heaven require, Others for boundless plains have pined ;
Grant me my country's smiles to meet, And let these limbs the grave devour Still probity with praise I'll greet, Still on the knave my vengeance pour.
Virtue exalted by the Muse, As the tall pine refresh'd with dews Lifts to the fostering heaven its branching head, Among the just in glory thrives.
A thousand helps kind friendship gives, Most when the conqueror's fame they spread.
Exulting victory still requires
The gazer's eye, the blazon'd name-
Oh !
Megas, that thy minstrel's fires Could from the shades thy soul reclaim !
Presumptuous wish, whose transient blaze Gleams on the scene but traced and gone!
Yet for thy Chariad tribe his skill can raise Th' eternal pillar of Pierian stone, Where all thy graved exploits may read-
The twofold triumph.
'Tis my boast to build The proud memorial equal to the deed.
Oft hath sweet bard the champion's toil beguiled ;
Long since the encomiast hymn was might's heroic meed ;
Before Adrastus' Theban fray✶
Our grandsires kindled at the lay.
FBOM Sicyon's field, ye powers of song, We'll lead the choiring pomp along To new-built Ætna's † echoing wali Where Chromius' gates unfolded wide Scarce take the stranger's pressing tide
That crowds his hospitable hall.
Strike ye the chords, your sweetest hymn prepare ;
On this triumphal day, Mounting his bright victorious car, To the great Mother and her offspring twain, Guardians of Pytho's towering fane, He consecrates the swelling lay.

Twas held of old, and many a tongue
In every age the truth has sung, That virtuous action to the ground Sinks not in silence long to pine , But 'tis the living song divine That spreads th' unboasted glory round.
Twang now the trembling lyre, the clarion fill, Sound we the chariot's game.
Which erst by old Asopus' rill Adrastus hallow'd* to the God of day, And, as we sing, the grateful lay Shall crown th' heroic founder's name.
A stranger on that throne he sat, And dignified the adopted state With new-form'd feasts and solemn shows, Where strength with strength adventuring strove, And still the circling chariot drove ;
He by faint friends and daring foes, Amphiareus' train, encompass'd round, His Argive realms had fled;
Where now, by plots and plans unsound Expell'd, no more the sons of Taläus reign'd. †
Let fools the vain dispute maintain ;
Peace only springs from wisdom's head.
'Twas thus, his sapient rival's rage
By love's all-softening pow'r to 'suage, Fair Eriphyle's virgin charms, Faith's surest pledge, Adrastus gave ;
Thus leagued, the first of Danaäns brave,* Again they join'd their threatening arms ;
Forth to sev'n-portall'd Thebes their bands they drew, Their-long combined array ;
Though birds ill-omen'd round them flew ;
Though hostile Jove disheartening thunders peal'd, Thwarting the desperate march they held, And warn'd them from the fatal way.
Still pressing on with furious haste Madly the advancing doom they faced ;
The field with brazen helmets burns ;
With brass the snorting war-steeds gleam;
From choked Ismenus' t crimson stream None of that countless host returns.
Sev'n brightening flames each on his several pyre Sev'n youthful champions feed ;
Jove, with his bolt's all-conquering fire, Cleft for Amphiareus earth's yawning womb, And closed in one portentous tomb Champion and chariot, arms and steed­Ere Periclymenus' javelin came With dastard's wound his back to shame, As from that fire, with quivering eye, The prophet warrior turn'd away ;
*
For when heaven sends the strange dismay E'en sons of gods will quail and fly.
O ward, Saturnian Jove, if fate permit, From Ætna's rising towers
The invader's rage, the desperate fight, The chains ev'n now Phœnician threats prepare ;
Grant her the blessings long to share
That law from concord's fountain pours :
Give her, great Jove, the nobler shade, Where glory twines her civic braid;
For she hath sons that love the race, Rule the swift steed;
whose bosoms hold Souls that disdain the lust of gold :
Doubt not such hearts are virtue's place.
Honour, the fount of glory, steals away, By gain's mean arts beguiled-
Squire thou young Chromius to the fray ;
Mark how in bark or band he braves the fight, The perilous spear, the horseman's might;
On rock or rampart, flood or field :
For honour.
like a god, hath dress'd
In adamant his warlike breast, And taught him, when his country calls, To meet unmoved the deadliest foe.
Few are the fiery souls that know, When war's fierce tempest heaviest falls, Back on th' assailant's arms and wavering ranks With hand and heart to turn
The wasteful wreck.
Scamander's banks For Hector's brow thick wreaths of glory bore ;
On deep Helorus' dangerous shore
The rival crowns of Chromius burn :
—There at th' Areian pass,* its mortal name, His country Is boast, Agesidame, Thy son the Punic spear defied, Yet but a youth, and round his head The radiant beams of conquest spread.
Fain would I tell what deeds beside
On land he dared and on the neighbouring brine !
Bright are the champion's days, And calm and prosperous his decline, Whose strenuous youth for just renown has fought.
Know, Chromius, know 'tis heaven that wrought
The rare success thy lot displays.
For when brave wealth and hard-earn'd praise
One gifted head conspire to raise, 'Tis not for mortal step to gain A loftier stand on fortune's hill, A nobler destiny to fill.
Sweet concord suits the social train,
And the green bough which brave desert receives
The lay's soft flowers enhance:
But 'tis the generous bowl that gives Clearness and courage to the minstrel's throat-
The prompting prophet of his note.
Bid the mingling beverage dance,The silver circling goblets shine With the stout offspring of the vine ;
— Goblets, which erst in Chromius' car,* Crown'd with Apollo's glittering bough.
Which justice weaves for glory's brow, The conquering coursers whirl'd from far- From Sicyon's sacred field.
Celestial sire, Grant to thy suppliant's hope
Thy graces to assist his lyre, Chromius above all youths in fame to raise, And fling the javelin of my praise Full at the skilful muse's scope.
ARGOS, the kingly seat Of Danäus and his fifty daughters fair, Juno's august abode, for godhead meet, Sing, heavenly Graces :
Virtue there Glows in a thousand glorious deeds.
Of regions vast and winged steeds,
And how the beauteous Gorgon fell, By Perseus foil'd, 'twere long to tell:
* Shine not on Egypt's shore with gorgeous hand By Epaphus unnumber'd cities rear'd ?†
And who admires not, when the guiltless brand By Hypermnestra sheath'd her slumbering bridegroom spared ?
A bright immortal god Diomede ‡ the beauteous blue-eyed Virgin made.
Touch'd by the Thunderer's arm and radiant rod Earth in her Theban bosom laid The prophet-son of (Ecleus proud,* In war the battle's threatening cloud.
Before all cities Argos claims
The palm for beauty's bright-hair'd dames ;
Jove bear me witness :
-from th' ethereal throne Alcmena's domes he sought and Danaë's tower :
He, in Adrastus' sire and Lynceust shown, Bade upright justice bloom with wisdom's fruitful flower.
He bless'd Amphitryon's conquering sword, His prosperous house with treasures stored ;
And while the distant warrior, brazen-mail'd, The fierce Teleboan‡ hosts assail'd, Couch'd in his form and mortal guise Th' eternal sovereign of the skies Within his courts the genial presence show'd, Mix'd his celestial race with his, And rear'd the undaunted Hercules :
—
Spouse of the rosy blooming bride
That walks by Juno's matron side, Rebe, the fairest form in all the blest abode.
§Words have no warmth to paint
The glorious stores of endless excellence
That gild the shrine of Argos :
praise grows faint, And palls the admirer's satiate sense.
Yet shall the wrestler's deeds inspire
The raptures of the well-strung lyre, To sound through all th' Argolic field
The conflict of the brazen shield By Juno's fuming altar, where the throng Hails young Theiæus, as the dazzling spoil The twice-crown'd son of Ulias bears along.
And quaffs from glory's cup th' oblivion of his toil.
First of the first he shone ’M ongst all the Hellenian host in Pytho's groves;
Isthmian and Nemean crowns his prowess won;
Fortune still follows as he moves.
Thrice at the gates that flank the main,* Thrice on the consecrated plain
Whose weal th' Adrastian laws diffuse, He sow'd the harvest of the Muse.
Paternal Jove !
the wish that fires his breast
His lip reveals not :
but all things in thee End and begin :
by dangers none repress'd, His toil-train'd heart but asks what all the brave would be.
What the Muse hopes thy godhead knows;
Knows he whose soul for glory glows, Who pants to bind him with th' Heraclian wreaths, Which Pisa's noblest rite bequeaths.
Him twice the sweet triumphal song, Breathed from the moving choir, among Panathenaic pomps and festal cries, Proclaim'd.
In clay-burnt shrine inurn'd Th' anointed victor's oil return'd To Juno's towers, whose gathering crowd, With marv'lling looks, and cheerings loud, Gazed on the pictured wall that fenced the liquid prize.
tNor less the rich renown Gain'd in the games thy famed maternal race Pursues;
them Leda's* twins with many a crown, With many a song the Muses grace.
Oh ! were I sprung from Antias' line, Were Thrasyclus my noble kin, With no sunk port, no drooping face, Would I 'mong proudest At-gives pace Prætus’ wide city-whose conquests who shall count ?
Mistress of steeds !
from Corinth's winding shore, From Nemea's grove, by fair Cleonæ's mount, Four times her envied sons the verdant victory bore.
In Sicyon's conflicts won With sparkling wine their silver goblets glow'd :
The wool-wove stole Pellenè's dames had spun, Soft from their trophied shoulders flow'd.
But to review the brazen spoils,
The ponderous arms that paid their toils, 'Twere vain ;
nor shall the attempt abuse
The leisure of the pressing Muse :
Arms that from Tegea, from Clitorium came, From towns that glitter'd on th' Achaean steep, From Jove's Lycæan mount,† and many a game
That proved the vigorous arm, the foot-race, and the leap.
What wonder yet that nature's flame Warm'd them to win the champion's fame !
When Pollux erst with godlike Castor pair'd
The social roof of Pamphäes shared (Whose blood thy sires, Theiæus, boast), And sojourn'd with th' heroic host.
For they, wide regents of the Spartan land, With Hercules and Hermes join'd, The wreaths of conquest blast or bind, And guard with more than mortal trust
The cares and honours of the just.
Our faith, our reverend love, the sons of heaven command.
They, with alternate change, To-day in Jove's celestial mansion dwell-
To-morrow through Therapnæ's vales they range, And shroud them in their earthly celL
Thus, join'd in glory as in woe, The same coeval doom they know;
Strange doom !
which rather than receive Godhead unqualified, and live Imperishable in heaven's eternal sphere, Great Pollux chose, since Castor breathed no more-
Whom haply Idas with his brazen spear Wrangling for worthless herds, stretch'd lifeless on the shore.
*Him 'gainst an oak reclined Lynceus from far Taygetus descried—✶
Lynceus, whose searching ken 'bove all mankind
The clearest, keenest glance supplied.
Bent on surprise, with vengeance bold, They sallied from their mountain hold, (Weak sons of Aphareus !) and with speed Plann'd and despatch'd the deadly deed.
Ill-counsell'd deed-too soon the wrath of Jove To rue—for now behind them close at hand Came Leda's threatening son, whose power to prove Fast by their father's tomb they fix'd their desperate stand.
Thence in their haste a ponderous rock,
The sculptured bust of death, they broke, And with dire impulse and direction true Full at the breast of Pollux threw.
He sunk not, but right onward sprung, By foul assault more fierce, and flung, Through Lynceus' heart transfixed, his brazen lance.
Jove at that instant in his ire Smote Idas with his bolted fire, And squander'd in the desert air The corses of the smouldering pair.
Hard is the strife when men 'gainst heavenly foes advance.
Quick from that blasted ground To Castor's aid th' afflicted brother flies;
Him not yet dead, but shuddering damp he found, With breath scarce heaved and half-closed eyes.
Pierced at the sight, with heart-warm tears, Groaning to heaven his voice he reals :
— " Saturnian sire, what blest release, “ What pause remains for grief like this ? "
Grant me with him to die, merciful king!
" Honour of friends bereft hath lost his stay, " Droops and is gone;
and few be they that bring "
The heart life's toils to share, and cheer us through the " day.
"Such was his noble prayer ;
When face to face before him standing shone Visible Jove, and spake :
—" Hear, warrior, hear, " Thou art mine own authentic son ;
"
Him, with thy beauteous mother pair'd, " Of mortal seed a hero rear'd. "
Mark now the large alternative, " To thy free wish the choice I give :
"
If 'tis thy will from death's cold grasp to fly, " From weak detested age and nature's waste, " With warlike Pallas in the sun-bright sky, " And sable-lanced Mars, eternal youth to taste-"
Such lot supreme 'tis thine to prove :
— "
But if thy zeal, thy godlike love, " Prompts and impels thee for thy brother's sake "
Dividual doom with him to take, " Half thy divine eternity "
In earth's dark womb with him must lie, " Half in the golden domes of heaven's domain."
The father paused-the brother's breast
No doubt perplex'd, no dread repress'd :
His touch the death-chain'd lids unbound, Loosed from his lips the thrilling sound, His brazen helm unclasn'd, and Castor lived again.
VESTA, that hold'st the Prytanæan hall,* From Rhea sprung, sister of highest Jove And Juno that partakes his throne above-
Into thy stately chamber deign to call Sage Aristagoras, thy sceptred hand Beside install'd with all his band.
They to thy glory in thy sight Through Tenedos dispense wisdom and power and light.
Eldest of gods, they, with libations pour'd, With fragrant offerings oft thy rites prolong, And trembling lyres resound and sacred song, While genial Themis her perpetual board Heaps with the feasts of hospitable Jove.
Grant him with heart unwrung to move Unblamed through all the important year, And straight by virtue's star his glorious course to steer.
Let not the cheering numbers pass
His sire, the blest Arcesilas, Th' accomplished form and cognate fortitude :
Yet let fond man, with wealth endued, With charms of shape transcendant graced, Midst the proud games 'mongst all the bold For brave achievement foremost placed, Forget not that his limbs are mortal mould, That earth, man's latest garb, that boasted frame must hold.
With patriot speech, with civic eulogy, Still Aristagoras 'tis meet to praise, And round his brow, with loud mellifluous lays Warbling his deeds, th' embellish'd crown to tie.
His and his country's name by him renown'd, Won from the bordering states around, Sixteen great conquests signalize, The dexterous wrestler's wreath, the tough Pentathlian prize.
Him sickly hope and pale parental fear Held from the perils of the Pythian field, From the rich risks Olympian chaplets yield :
Else (by my judgment's pledge, my oath, I swear) From those stern pastimes his superb return
Had left his vanquish'd foes to mourn
By lone Castalia's murmuring rill, And seek the sheltering oaks that shade the Cronian hull ;
*Else, through the loud quinquennial throng
His pomp triumphal moved along, With purple branches wreathed, the Heraclian feast Had crown'd.
But man's inconstant breast Oft, by presumptuous hope betray'd, Quits for wild dreams the bliss long known ;
Oft manliest might, with youth display'd, Cold cowardice with heartless tongue talks down, Plucks back th' adventurer's arm, and scares him from the crown.
Who would not vouch for one, whose sire can boast The Spartan blood that fired Pisander's vein, What time, with brave Orestes, o'er the main From throng'd Amyclæ to this sea-girt coast
In brazen arms tb' Æolian bands he led ;
* For one, whose line's maternal head, By famed Ismenus' flowery vale, From Melanippus† springs-so born, what chief could faiVirtues, like circling spheres, by periods move-
Pass from the sire away, then blaze again
In the son's son.
The sable-cultured plain Yields not each year the fruits of nature's love :
From the green tree not every season pours
Her gem-like buds, her fragrant flowers :
‡
All things by sweet suspension thrive, And mortal races bloom and wither and revive.
'Tis not for man's weak wit to find
Th intent that moves the omniscient mind :
Yet blindly thus the bark of pride we steer;
The schemes of greatness rashly rear ;
Link'd with audacious hope we mount, To fortune's dizziest peak aspire, Where springs no stream from wisdom's fount.
Seek thou the virtuous mean :
the fierce desire
That lusts for loves forbid, is frenzy's wildest are.
THEBE,✶fair heroine of the golden shield, Thy dear maternal call before all tasks Anxious I meet,—Delos, whose rocky field Claims all my song, grudge not the boon she asks.
A parent's will is duty's choice :
Isle of Apollo, to that call give way:
Soon shall my lyre and willing voice
Your joint requests fulfil, if heaven inspires the lay,-Hymning on Ceos's cliffs and billowy shore, Her seamen choirs among, the God of day With unshorn locks refulgent, and the roar Of Isthmian waves that wash the twofold bay;
From whose loud cirque and labour'd game Six glittering wreaths the sons of Cadmus won, Crowning their glorious country's name
Where great Alcmena rear'd her brave all-conquering son ;
From whose stern port and brandish'd trunk The dogs of Geryon* cower'd and shrunk.
But hear Herodotus demand For his tried speed the chariot-victor's dole, Guiding with no auxiliar hand His four fleet coursers to the goal.
Sing him the song of godlike Iölas,† Or Castor's hymn his skill to grace :
Foremost of charioteers were they To win the wreath that wakes the lay Of Thebes or Sparta's hero race.
They at the games in fierce athletic fight Adventured, and, with many a chaplet crown'd, Tasted sweet victory.
With tripods bright Goblets and cups of gold emblazon'd round
Their mansions flamed, worth's gorgeous meed ;
Unrivall'd worth-along the sounding field Urged they unarm'd their winged speed, Or clad them for the race and shook the clanging shield.
How hurl'd they not the disk's far-bounding stone ?
From their strain'd arms the whizzing javelin flew;
(The tough Pentathlian contests then unknown, Each perfect toil its several guerdon drew) :
Thus oft by famed Eurotas' wave, By Dircè's sparkling fount their glories shone ;
And proudly danced their temples brave With bowers of countless wreaths their strenuous aims had won.
Such Iphicles' illustrious seed, Compatriot with earth's dragon breed ;
* Such Tyndarus' godlike son from high Therapnè's hold o'er-peer'd th' Achæan plain :
t Farewell, proud heroes !
and while I To the loud master of the main, To sacred Isthmus and th' Onchestian shore
The melting strain promiscuous pour, With the son's praise the beauteous lyre Shall chant th' adventures of the sire, The toils of brave Asopodore.
Him, on his fortune's fragments ill sustain'd, Toss'd on the rough surge of a boundless sea, Orchomenus, through direst dangers gain'd, Fostering received.
His boisterous destiny, Now smoothed again to loveliest calm, Gleams with the radiance of his earlier day ;
Experience with reflection's balm Misfortune's wounds hath heal'd and shown him wisdom's way.
*But if success man's noblest powers demand, And cost and labour wait upon renown, Well may the minstrel with no sparing hand, No vulgar praise, the liberal athlete crown.
'Tis but the pastime, not the pain Of Genius his unfailing word to give, That bravery shall not strive in vain, That virtue raised by him in Fame's bright heaven shall livo.
All have their tasks, and each by turns
His favourite compensation earns :
The ploughman rude, the shepherd, all That strike the wild-bird's wing, or fish the deep, Stir but at hunger's craving call, And struggle but to feast and sleep ;
But he that in rough game or mortal fight Bids the foil'd foe record his might, Wins for his work the brave man's crown, The lofty lucre of renown, His nation's pride, the world's delight.
Change we the strain, in loftier mood to sing
The neighbouring temple's god, whose angry mace Rocks the firm continent, Saturnian king, Lord of the steed, the chariot, and the race ;
To sing Amphitryon's sons divine,* Eubœa's isle,t and Minyas' stately towers.
And famed Eleusis,§ by whose shrine Ceres her cirque displays and mute mysterious bowers.
Yet must I name thy tomb, Protesilas,|| In Phylacè by chiefs Achæan plann'd, Thy field and sacred stadium :
but to trace Th' equestrian trophies all, by Hermes' hand Heap'd on Herodotus, the sum Would pass the bounds of my contracted song.
Best eloquence is sometimes dumb, And silence teems with praise, when flattery hath no tonguæRaised on th' illustrious Muse's wing, That soars to heaven his deeds to sing, O may he yet from Pytho's hill, From where rich Alpheus laves the Olympian shrine, His hand with noblest chaplets fill, And for sev'n-portall'd Thebes new honours twine.
But he that with full hand and spirit poor
In secret hoards his ill-got store, And sneers at prostrate virtue's need, Forgets that glory's deathless meed Blooms not for him on Pluto's shore.
'WAS long, good Thrasybule,* the minstrel's use, When in old times our tuneful sires Mounted the chariot of the muse, And struck with ardent hand their glorious lyres, At some brave youth to send amain
The shafts of their melodious strain-
Some youth that just had reach'd the vigoroils hour
When love first learns to long for beauty's blushing flower.
Then was the Muse no drudge;
her artless measures
No hireling lust of gain inspired :
The dance, the feast, the frolic pleasures Terpsichorè's mellifluous numbers fired ;
With fair, untinsell'd front, unsold, Her soft persuasive tale she told.
In these ill days th' Argæan sage's word (Alas, how true !) she gives her votaries to record :
Stripp'd of possessions, friends, and all, " Wealth makes the man," wealth only, was his call.
t
Thou art not dull of spirit;
to the unwise I sing not of the equestrian crown From Isthmian rivals nobly won, Which to Xenocrates great Neptune gave, And sent his Dorian parsley's* prize Around those crisped brows to wave.
Raised by the god, the chariot-victor shone
The lamp of Agrigent;
nor less His power in Crisa's contest t known, Where Phœbus saw and clothed him with success.
Him foremost in th' Athenian race Erechtheus' sons with plaudits grace ;
There with no erring hand, the charioteer His bounding steeds rebuked, and wound their fleet career;
For 'twas Nicomachus, whose well-timed skill, With reins all loose, their fury drove.
Him, once their host,* the seers that fill
The pure libations to Saturnian Jove, Th' Eleian seers, whose voice proclaims
The season of the sacred games, On the soft lap of golden conquest placed, With soothing accents sweet on Pisa's plains embracedPisa, their native land, the grove And spacious temple of Olympian Jove-
With whose brave sports, pride of their princely sire, The sons of great Œnesidame t Mingled the glories of their name :
For not unsounded in the song divine, . Unknown to the triumphal choir, Shines Thrasybule's illustrious line.
No wild impervious course hath he to run, Mounts no acclivity of praise, With whom the maids of Helicon ‡ To Virtue's mansion bear their lasting lays.
0 ! could I hurl as far, as long, The disk, the javelin of my song, As thy sweet sire in goodness all outshone !—
All hearts his modest worth, his gracious converse won.
The Panhellenian rule* his sports obey'd;
His stall with generous steeds he stored;
Low to each listening god he pray'd,
At feast, or shrine, or altar :
at his board Ceased not the fresh convivial gale
To fill the banquet's swelling sail;
His bounty's voyage, as the summer's smile
Or wintry gloom prevail'd, was Phasis or the Nile.
†Ne'er may the son ‡ (for envy's cloud Oft with base hopes the purest heart will shroud) Attempt his sire's great virtues to conceal, Nor bid these lays in silence sleep ;
They are not sculptured blocks that keep
The same dull base-through all the world they flee :
To my kind host, with all thy zeal, This, Nicasippus, bear for me.
THE man, by fortune raised, that holds Unflush'd with pride his blameless course, Though glory's wreath his front enfolds, Or wealth with power hath bless'd his stores, His country's praise to deathless fame shall give.
Yet but from thee th' exalted virtues flow, All-bounteous Jove !
and they that know,
And fear thy laws, rejoice and live ;
While he that walks sin's wandering way, Ends not in bliss the changeful day.
Reward awaits the virtuous deed;
The brave command the grateful lyre ;
For them th' applauding Graces lead, And swell the loud triumphal choir.
Fortune on proud Melissus hath bestow'd
The twofold boon, that glads his manly breast;
— First in the cirque his waving crest With Isthmian wreaths exulting glow'd ;
Now through the Lion's vale* the name Of Thebes his herald's shouts proclaim­Him master of the equestrian race Proclaim;
his deeds no kindred name disgrace :
His grandsire's fame, 'mong charioteers of old, Cleonymus, all tongues have told ;
Told how from Labdacus, with affluence crown'd,* His mothers sires in happier days
The car quadrigal proudly drove.
But Time, as rolling seasons onward move, His altering hand on all things lays :
The sons of gods alone nor chance nor change can woundTHANKS to the gracious gods, around Behold the spacious paths display'd
Which thou, with Isthmian chaplets crown'd, Melissus, by thy deeds hast made ;
Where now thy virtues rare the song shall trace-
Virtues by heaven bestow'd, which nobly thus Have steer'd the brave Cleonymus†
Through life's rough tide with all his race :
But fortune's gale with changeful force Drives every mortal, every course.
They, 'mong the Theban chiefs adored, In honour's seat unenvied sat:
Contiguous worthies throng'd their board ;
No babbling pride debased their state.
Whate'er the flattering annal of the past Breathes for the dead, whate'er the voice of praise
To living worth profusely pays, Twas theirs in copious draughts to taste, And touch with virtues all their own Th' Herculean columns of renown;
—Bounds which no mortal powers can pass.
They train'd the raging courser to the race ;
On them the brazen Mars propitious smiled;
Fatal regard !
the tempest wild
Of roughest war, in one disastrous hour, From their loved hearth and prosperou shome Four kindred warriors swept away.
Now, when the wintry month and darken'd day No longer lowers, again they bloom, Like the fresh vernal vale, with nature's rosiest flower.
Such is heav'n's will;
and he that shakes Earth's bellowing shore, th' Onchestian god,* What time by Corinth's walls he makes Her sea-bridge loud his wild abode, Hath given Melissus' race this blazoning strain :
He from the couch of ages, where she lay In dark oblivion hush'd away, Hath roused their ancient fame again, That now, like Lucifer, displays, Brightest of stars, her rising rays :
She on the throng'd Athenian strand-
She where for Sicyon's glittering games
His chariot-cirque Adrastus plann'd, First at the goal proclaim'd their names, Bidding rude bards their wreaths of song prepare.
Nor at the grand Assemblage,* where the pride
Of all th' Hellenian champions vied, Fear'd they to whirl the circling car :
Their boast the sumptuous steed to try ;
The brave unproved in silence die.
Warriors themselves, till fortune's hand Th' ennobling victory gives, no fame command ;
For e'en the conqueror's wreath is fortune's gift.
Oft hath the feebler rival's shift Filch'd from the best his undisputed crown.
Who knows not Ajax' injured name ?+
How in his wrath, at wane of night, With his own trusty sword and slander'd might, That frantic breast he pierced :
oh !
shame
To all the sons of Greece that sack'd the Phrygian town!
Him yet with noblest eulogy 'Mongst all mankind hath Homer sung, Lifting his virtues to the sky—
Him to remotest ages rung
In loud enduring rhapsodies of praise.
'Tis inspiration's word, the gifted strain That lasts for ever :
o'er the main, Through earth's rich realms and wildest ways, The star of brave achievement gleams
His unextinguishable beams.
Oh !
for a willing Muse, to light Like him the living lamp of song, And blazon the Pancratian fight Won by Melissus from the strong !
Branch of Telesias, like the roaring king
Of the rough woods in heart and strength is be, Yet guileful as the fox might be That stays the impetuous eagle's wing, Couch'd on the ground supine below :
*
All sleights are just that foil the foe.
For he no vast Oärion port Displays, of outward stature mean and short ;
-
In the fierce conflict stanch and terrible.
Such once Alcmena's son, they tell, Of moderate mould though form'd, but prowess-proof, Sallying from Thebes to Libya's shore, Where in huge hold Antaeus t lay, Provoked the giant-wrestler to the fray;
That so that ruffian host no more With skulls of murder'd guests pale Neptune's fane might roofTo heaven's eternal realms he pass'd;
His search explored earth's spacious plain, The strands and promontories vast
That bound the basin of the main :
For the safe bark he clear'd th' infested floods;
Now in his golden dome with highest Jove He quaffs unmingled joys above, Beloved and honour'd by the gods, And wins, to Juno's self-allied, The beauteous Hebè for his bride.
For him, o'er famed Electra's gate,* We Thebans still the feast prepare, And with fresh flow'rets consecrate
The new-built altars blazing there ;
—
Blazing with offerings to the spirits brave
Of his eight sons from blooming Megara born ;
To them, from eve to radiant morn, Through the long night continuous wave The reddening flames, and toss on high Their fuming fragrance to the sky.
The morrow's cheering dawn proclaims
The feats of manly strength and annual games:
Melissus foremost there fresh myrtles bound
In glittering braids his temples round, And gain'd victorious twice the fearful fray :
A third his youthful arm had won, What time the skilful charioteer School'd his rude hand the wavering team to steer—
Share, Orseus, then thy lord s renown, While thus on both we pour the graces of the lay.
O MOTHER of the sun that gilds the day, Bright Theia,* for thy sake fond mortals hold Before all names of wealth the potent gold.
For lo, when in the swift and circling fray
The chariot-harness'd steeds, the galleys brave, Moved by thy quickening power, engage, What wonder waits on land and wave The proud achievements of their rage.
Touch'd by thy spirit, in the athletic war Glory the champion earns, whose manual force, Or footstep foremost in the panting course, Have won thick chaplets for his flowing hair.
But 'tis heavens doom that gives success below.
Two things alone, with wealth combined, Feed life's sweet flower, and thus bestow Joy's purest blessings on mankind ;
—These are fair fortune and recording fame.
Aspire not to be Jove ;
all things are thine.
If these great gifts thy destiny may claim :
To mortal hopes thy mortal means confine.
For thee, Fhylacides, in Neptune's field Two chaplets bloom :
the proud Pancratian dole For thee, with Pytheas* joined, the Nemeans yield.
Apart th' Æacean race, my thirsty soul Tastes not the lay :
but Lampon's sons to sing, To just Ægina's walls my willing lyre I bring.
Oh !
while her chiefs still trace the blameless ways
To where achievement does the eternal will, Grudge not, my Muse, with flowing song to fill The beverage of the brave, her cup of praise.
For when by virtuous deeds warriors became Heroes of old, the sounding lyre Told to all times their envied name, And glory's clarion swell'd the choir :
Thus by Jove's bounteous grace they shone the theme
Of eloquence and song, and worship found And sacrifice :
thus yet with victims crown'd To Œneus'†sons the Ætolian altars gleam Thebes to the brave equestrian Iölas, ‡ Argos the vow to Perseus § pours;
Sparta fair Leda's warlike race By pure Eurotas' stream adores,But famed Œonè|| the stout-hearted powers Of Æacusand his seed :
with flame and sword
They to their base twice razed the Trojan towers, With Hercules, and Helen's injured lord.
Bear now, my Muse, thy chariot from the ground Aloft, and tell me what unrivall'd hand Cycnus and Hector slew, and Memnon, crown'd With brazen arms, before his Æthiop band :
Say who the valiant Telephus defied,* With his own spear transfix'd t by red Caïcus’ tide.
Who but Ægina’s sons, their country's boast ?
Transcendent isle !
Long since the song divine
The tower whereon thy lofty virtues shine Ascended :
much of thy illustrious host
My tongue's unerring shaft hath still to sound-
Witness triumphal Salamis By Ajax' towers encompass'd round ;
Midst war's mad waves and angry skies,By naval strength sustained, by myriads press'd, She braved the deathful hailstorm of the fray:
But steep'd in silence be the vaunting lay—
Jove, lord of all things, as it seems him best, Dispenses good and ill :
yet in sweet song Honours like these delight to live, And conquest's ecstasies prolong
In strains the wise alone can give.
Henceforth let youths from Cleonicus' race
Their labour's lesson learn ;
for not in night Slumber their proud achievements, nor with base Regret grudged they the cost of glory's fight.
Now shall not Pytheas, whose experienced hand First taught the rude Pbylacides to know The champion's art and onset, stroke and stand, Share our free praise ?
Twine round his manly brow
The wool-wrought band and chaplet :
* speed away
To crown the matchless pair thy new, thy winged lay !
As with replenish'd bowl the banquet glows, Again for Lampon's brave athletic linet
We mix the Muses' cup divine :
The first to Jove was pour’d,‡ when round their brows His Nemean braid illustrious hung ;
This to the despot of the seas, And fifty damsels fair from Nereus sprung, For wreaths by youngest born Phylacides From Isthmian rivals torn :
on Pisa's plain Oh !
that 'twere theirs a third to gain, Mine in the Olympian Saviour's name to shed The full mellifluous hymn on blest Ægina’s head.
For he that with bold heart and bounteous hand Makes virtue's heavenly work his life's pursuit, Whose genius bids the golden fruit
Of loveliest glory bloom at his command-
His anchor he, by heav'n advanced, On fortune's farthest shore bath cast.
With such great gifts, such energies enhanced, For reverend age and death’s repose at last
The sapient son of Cleonicus* prays :
With him my fervent vows I raise
To the high throne, where with her sisters twain Eventful Clothot sits, my friend's wise wish to gain.
For you, ye sons of godlike Æacus, Lords of the golden chariot, my fond Muse To yon loved isle returning, thus Your names with wonted eulogy bedews.
Your proud achievements, blazed around From land to land, a thousand tracks have trod- Through Hyperborean wilds, beyond The farthest fount of Nilus' flood.
Is there a barbarous realm so rude of tongue Where Peleus' fame an4' fortunes none hath sung, Th' heroic spouse that won the daughter of a god ?
*Is there where Ajax' deeds are yet unknown, Or Telamon's ?
whom erst his prompt ally, War's brazen-beaming field to try, Roused at the fraud of false Laomedon, Against Troy's wall Alcides led,† A hero's toil, and o'er the main
On the wind's wing his hosts Tirynthian ‡ sped.
With him combined Pergamia's fruitful plain, With him that herdsman dire of mountain mould, Alcyoneus, in Phlegræ's hold He spoil'd ;
he vanquished the Meropian foe ;
§
Nor twang'd his hand in vain the deadly-bounding bow.
'Twas at the crowded feast Alcmena's seed, To join the embarking host by herald named, The son of Æacus proclaim'd.
Him, fierce and frowning in his warrior's weed Of lion's pelt, sage Telamon Bade pour the sparkling nectarous wine, Libation pure to bless th' exploit begun, And to his grasp the cup, with golden shine
And rough embossment rich, auspicious press'd :
Forthwith, with hands to heaven address'd, Aloud the horo pray'd :
" Paternal Jove, " If e'er these lips had power thy sovereign will to move," Grant to my holiest wish, my warmest prayer, " My friend's fond hope, from Eribœa's womb "
In time's due course a valiant heir "
To spring, and perfect his appointed doom !
"
Stubborn and sturdy be his frame, " Like this tough hide that round my shoulder traits, " Stripp'd from the monster's trunk, the same "
This hand first foil'd in Nemea's vales :
" Brave be his heart.
”
—This said, propitious Jove Despatch'd his own great eagle from above :
With joy the plumed king surprised Alcides hails.
Then loud again, as with a prophet's tongue, " 0 Telamon, the child thou ask'st is thine," He cried ;
“ behold yon bird divine­ “ Authentic signal!
fierce and strong "
Like him thy warlike son shall be, And Ajax his emphatic name."*
Thus spake and sat Alcides.
But for me 'Twere long their countless virtues to proclaim— For I, loved Muse, but came my choral lay To crown'd Phylacides to pay, And Pytheas and Euthymenes.† that so In Argive mood concise ‡ my bounded praise might flow.
For three Pancratian chaplets, each his prize, From Isthmian sands the kindred champions bore ;
No less from Nemea's grove they tore.
Then what loud hymns and copious minstrelsies Burst from the lyre !
whose beauteous dews
On all their tribe Psalychian fell, Gemm'd with the brightest sprinklings of the Muse.
They ’mongst Ægina’s heav'n-loved mansions dwell;
Where raised by them thy house, Themistius,* shines;
Where Lampon to his sons enjoins Hesiod's sage rule, in his own practice told, " Still to the task in hand with earnest heart to hold.
"There round his country's brows his crown he flings ;
His bounteous hand the stranger's blessing shares ;
Still to the golden mean he clings ;
The palm of modest worth contented bears.
His tongue still keeps his bosom's pledge ;
And as the Naxian hone t subdues and moulds Hardest of rocks, the falchion's edge, Such place ’mongst athlete chiefs he holds.
For them from Dirce’s fount,‡ the living spring Which golden-vested Memory's daughters bring, I'll pour, where Cadmus' wall its towering port unfolds.
FOR which of all thy sons renown'd of yore, Fortunate Thebes, most swell'd thy patriot pride ?
Was it when full-hair'd Bacchus graced thy shore, That sits enthroned by cymball'd Ceres' side ?✶
Or when the lord of heaven's domain Deign'd from his genial cloud to rain Within thy wondering walls below
The midnight shower of golden snow,What time in proud Amphitryon's porch he stood.
And bade the teeming dame Alcides bear ?
Was’t when the future fate Tiresias show'd ?
Or Iölas † taught the furious steed to fear ?
Or when earth's brood ‡ in arms sprung out ?
Or when Adrastus from the shout Of thy loud host recoil'd amain, His friends all fled, his myriads slain,Back to his Argive steeds and sheltering towers ?
§ Or when thy colonies, with Dorian shoot Ingrafted, raised on Spartan root Their vigorous branches j and the Pythian powers Sent Ægeus’ sons, thy warlike race, Amyclæ’s plunder'd walls to sway?*
But, since departed glory's grace Full fast from mortal memory fades away,Save when kind genius rears the blooming flower, And bathes it with the glistening dews of song—
Haste thou thy sweet triumphal hymn to pour For brave Strepsiades, whose brows along Pancratian wreaths from Isthmus bear;
Fierce his stout port, yet shapely fair,- Fair, yet enhanced with virtue's charms, More lovely than the frame it warms.
Lo while his name and fame his uncle shares,
Their violet locks th' applauding Muses wave- Fall'n in the field of brazen-shielded Mars, † For honour is the guerdon of the brave.
Assured be he, whose generous pow'r,
In the fierce fight's tempestuous hour, Wards from his country's front away
The furious hailstorm of the fray,Hurling retorted vengeance on the foe, - That fame his life shall crown, and largely grade Beyond the grave his honour'd race.
Son of Diodotus, now liest thou low, Rival in war's destructive game Of Meleager, and the dread Amphiareus, and Hector's fame !
In youth's fair prime thy lofty spirit fled'
Twas in the fight’s first rank, where round thee cast
Their desperate stand thy bravest comrades made :
Much hath thy fate perplex'd me !-but 'tis past- Neptune with gracious hand the storm hath laid,* And all is calm again.
I'll fling Braids round the victor's brows and sing.
Quench not, kind heav'n, the minstrel's fire ;
Grudge not the raptures of the lyre !
'Tis but the moment's ecstasy, which I, Well pleased, in peace indulge, till age and death Shall come, as come they must-for all shall die, Though fates unequal close our days beneath.
Man is too brief long aims to reach :
Presumptuous hope, that fain would stretch
To heaven's high throne her daring view, Is but the winged steed that threwBellerophon, what time his frenzied prid.
Aspired to tread th' eternal domes above,1 And sit amongst the peers of Jove.
Such baneful fruits forbidden joys betide.
0 Loxias, whose unclouded brow Beams with the golden locks of day, Grant us thine own great games to know, And bind our temples with thy Pythian bay.
LEAD forth the tuneful pomp, the moving choir, Bid them their rich reward prepare To crown Cleander's youthful war, At the proud porch of Telesarch, his sire, Sounding the loud triumphal strain :
Such meed his Isthmian conquest claims, Such his tried strength in Nemea's games.
For him, though pierced with pain, With public grief though wrung, will I Yet woo the golden Muse to wake Her cheering minstrelsy.*
From huge disasters free, no more Its wreath the champion's front shall lack :
Past ill 'tis folly to deplore ;
0 grieve not at the abortive wrong ;
The toil hath ceased, the fight is won.
Spread far and wide the joyful strain-
For lo !
the ponderous stone Of Tantalus, that o'er us threatening hung, Some god hath heaved aside, and Greece revives again.
Intolerable weight!
till dread dismay
Thus by celestial aid dispell'd,
My soul's o'erwhelming care had quell'd :
But to the business of the present day, Man’s best employ - for time unseen Hangs o'er us with his shadowy thong, Urging life's stealthy steeds along.
Yet well brave hearts, I ween, Wounds deep as ours, with freedom blest, May bear, and for success to come
On hope's assurance rest.
Born in sev'n-portall'd Thebes,† 'tis mine Song's sweetest flowers and freshest bloom For famed Ægina's brows to twine.
She with her heroine sister brave, Fairest and youngest of their line, From old A sopus sprung, and won Jove's amorous grace divine ;
He gave, where Dircè pours her limpid wave, The chariot-echoing walls for beauteous Thebe's throne :
Thee, to th' CEnopian isle * imbower'd he led, Whence Æacus his heavenly birth Derived, of kings revered on earth
The most that issued from the Thunderer's bed.
The powers that hell's tribunal fill, Defined by him, their dooms profound :
+
His godlike sons, in fight renown'd,
Their sons, more godlike still, Surpass'd :
they knew the spear to wield ;
The gathering groan, the rout to spread, And sway the troubled field.
To them was keen discernment given, And temperance chaste by wisdom bred ;
Not unpreferr'd, unmark'd by heaven, What time for Thetis Neptune strove, In the full hall of state divine, 'Gainst Jove, inflamed with rival fire, The beauteous nymph to win.
Yet not, by love though touch'd, all conquering love, Though gods immortal born, urged they that rash desire,Awed by the dread response which Themis ‡ gave, Sage warner to the assembled sky, The thrilling threat of destiny :
"
Gods, should the mistress of the raging wave " To Jove's all-procreant.
arms aspire, "
Or brother's of high Jove, a king “
From that portentous love shall spring , "
More potent than his sire ;
— "
One, whose stout hand a bolt shall throw "
More fearful than the trident's might, " Or thunder's instant blow, " Cease then the fatal suit, while she “ Some mortal love shall best requite ;
"
And slain her son in battle see, " Though strong as war's impetuous god, " Swift as the lightning's radiant wing :
— “ To Peleus, son of Æacus, be ours "
The bridal prize to bring, “ Destined by heaven, to where his calm abode
The pious conqueror holds in rich Iolcus' bowers‘
To Chiron's cave,* within th' eternal hill, " Swift be the blissful tidings borne ;
"
No more this Nereid nymph forlorn "
Our hands with plaints of clamorous love shall fill "
Bid her, when now full-orb'd on high "
Dim evening's front the moon shall grace, “ Clasp'd in the hero's fond embrace " Her virgin bond untie."
Thus to the gods of Saturn's line Heaven's arbitress their sentence sung :
Waved they their brows divine, Th' assenting nod in silence made, Nor left th' eternal fruit that hung
On her wise words unpluck'd to fade.
Jove now the sea-maid's nuptial plann’d :
And song in thrilling numbers taught To youth's unpractised ear the deeds Divine Achilles wrought.
See Telephus beneath his conquering hand On Mysia's vine-clad plain, her gasping monarch, bleeds.
His arm fair Helen for Atrides' sake Released, and o'er the billowy bourn Bridged for the Greeks their wish'd return.
The sinews of Troy's war his javelin brake, Memnon and manliest Hector's might, And many a famous chief beside, Whose rage oft stay'd the slaughter's tide, Oft turn'd the doubtful fight.
To these pale Proserpine's abode, Tower of the sons of Æacus, The great Achilles show'd, Gave to all times Ægina’s name, And crown'd his grandsire's glorious house.
Him ev'n in death the chant of fame Forgot not;
o'er his sacred pyre Th' Aonian maids enraptured hung, And in full choir around his grave
The strain of glory sung.
Thus to the powers that sway the living lyre Rewarding heav'n commits the memory of the brave.
Fired by that spirit, to Nicocles' * tomb, Brave champion, her careering song The Muses' chariot bears along, Sounding his Isthmian conquest, and the bloom Of Dorian parsley round his brows.
Full many a tough ill-omen'd foe His hand's inevitable blow, At games and bordering shows, Stunn'd and subdued.
The stripling's fam , That calls his glorious uncle sire, Dishonours not his name.
Let rival youths with myrtle weed Oleander's glittering locks attire, The stout Pancratian victor's meed.
His might in Epidaurus* shown, Him in th' Alcathoän contest crown'd, Fortune with all her smiles embraced.
The brave his praise shall sound :
For no sequester'd course, no path unknown, Unstrew'd with glory's flowers, his virtuous steps have traced.
THE END.
