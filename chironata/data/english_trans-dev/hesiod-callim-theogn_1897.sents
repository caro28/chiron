" HESIOD and Homer,” writes the father of history, (Herod. ii. 53,) "lived, as I consider, not more than four hundred years before my time."
It has been argued that this state­ ment must be taken as relating only to the author of the Theogony, while to the author of the Works and Days, (see Pausan. ix. 31, § 4,) belongs a date perhaps not less than one hundred and twenty years later.
It is therefore inex­ plicable.
how Herodotus can have spoken of the Hesiod of the Works and Days (on whose non-identity with the author of the Theogony modern writers of weight are agreed with the Bœotians of old) as contemporary with Homer.
But even the Theogony is nowise to be deemed of the same age with the Iliad or Odyssey, whether we consider its more advanced and systematized mythology, (an argument strongly urged by Mr. Grote, in his, History of Greece,) its extended geography, or the general testimony of ancient authors.
Amidst great uncertainty, it is perhaps safe to assign the date of the Theogony to the same period as the Works and Days;
leaving the question open whether the author was the same Hesiod, or some composer of the Hesiodic school, a mode of solving the difficulty which has been suggested by the German commentators.
In what way to reconcile the statement of Herodotus with all that is ascertained with reference to Hesiod's age, it is difficult to determine:
for by his computation Homer and Hesiod must have contemporane­ ously flourished 884 years before Christ:
whereas, as has been observed, the difference of date between the two may be easily detected from an ordinary examination of their poems.
Perhaps it may be assumed that Herodotus is speaking of Homer gener­ ally as representing the beginning, and Hesiod as the close, of a period;
and that in an uncertainty as to the real chronology of the two poets, which the very words of the historian manifest to have been rife, he notes down the proximate date of the former as standing for that of both.
Mr. Grote places the author of the Theogony, as well as of the Works and Days, in the period between 750—700 B. c., and this will square with the computation of Velleius Paterculus, who makes Hesiod one hundred and twenty years later than Homer, as well as with the statements of ancient writers that he flourished about the 11th Olympiad.
From the consideration of Hesiod's age we pass on to one concerning which we have clearer data,-his birthplace and his family.
It is stated by the poet himself (Op. et D. 636—640) that his father migrated across the Ægean from Cumæ in Æolia, so that he, as well as the Mæonian bard, derived their origin from that colony of Hellas which was so prolific in minstrelsy, so rich in the Muses of history, song, and science.
One or two modern writers have attempted, perhaps from a natural wish to connect Hesiod more closely with Homer, to make out that Hesiod was himself born at Cumæ, and emigrated with his father when grown up.
But this theory is upset by the poet's own statement, that his father crossed the sea and settled at Asera, a village of Boeotia, at the foot of Mount Helicon, in pursuit of gain, and that he never trusted him­ self to the waves, except from Aulis in Bceotia across the Euripus to Chalets in Euboea, (Op. et D. 651,) where he won a tripod as the prize of a poetical contest, founded by Am­ phidamas, a king of the island, in order to keep up the me­ mory of his own obsequies.
This tripod Hesiod dedicated to the Muses of Helicon.
This evidence as to the native place of the poet, is further substantiated by the epigram of Chersias of Orchomenus, quoted by Pausanias, (ix. 38, ad fin.,) of which the following lines are a free translation, " Though fertile Ascra gave sweet Hesiod birth, Yet rest his bones beneath the Minyan earth, Equestrian land.
There, Hellas, sleeps thy pride, The wisest bard of bards in wisdom tried;
" as well as by the line of Moschus, (Idyll. iii. 88,) “ Asera, for her own bard wise Hesiod, less express’.
”The general opinion of the ancients further confirms the notion that Ascra was the poet's birth-place:
and we may point to the epithet "Ascræus,” applied to him by Ovid, (Fast. vi. 14,) (Art. Am. ii. 4,) and Virgil, (Eccl. vi. 70,) (Georg. ii. 176.) It is not, however, by any means im­ possible that Hesiod's sire may have retained after his mi­ gration to Greece the rights of citizenship which he held at Cumæ, and these may have descended to his son, as was not un frequent in the Greek colonies.
At Ascra it would seem that Hesiod's father did not enjoy the rights of citizenship in the home of his adoption, as is in­ ferred from a comparison of the expression νάσσατο, (Op. et D. 637,) used generally of emigrants and colonists with the Homeric phrase άτίμητ
ος μετανάστης, which points to the condition of the “metæch,” or "resident alien," defined by Aristotle, Politics III. v. 9, (Congreve,) as ὁ τω̃ν τιμω̃ν μὴ μετέχων, as being that of the father of Hesiod at Ascra.
Yet even thus it would seem that his substance increased, and that he had his share of the wealth most common in the primitive ages, — the flocks and herds, which we find Hesiod feeding at Helicon, (Theog. 23,) and to a moiety of which he seems to have succeeded by inheritance, though, owing to the bribe-purchased award of corrupt judges, his brother Perses won a suit which robbed our poet of his patri­ mony.
But ill-gotten gain took to itself speedy wings.
Hesiod, the defrauded, if we may judge from Op.
et D. 396, was able afterwards to give the thriftless defrauder aid, from means which he had acquired in spite of his losses, although, if we note the force of the preposition in the verb ἐπιδαίω in that line, it is clear that he plainly tells his brother that he will give him no more in future, unless he ceases to idle in the Agora, and will turn to work for his daily bread.
It is to this same Perses that the Works and Days are addressed, and they afford a goodly example of brotherly interest for one who had wronged the poet in the highest degree.
The complaints of Hesiod respecting the injustice of which the kings, or chiefs of the Agora, were in his day guilty, convey a striking picture of the crying abuse and evil, upon which the Homeric poems are not altogether silent.
(Cf. Horn. Il. xvi. 387;
Hesiod, Op. et D. 250—263.)
These things may have tended to strengthen the poet's dis­ like for Ascra, which he expresses pretty freely in ver.
639 640 of his Works and Days, verses probably written at- Orchomenus, to which he is supposed to have migrated, (com­ pare the epigram of Chersias translated above,) and which Velleius Paterculus notices in Lib. i. c. 7, where he says, of him, “ Patriamque et parentes testatus est, sed patriam quιὰ.
multatus ab ea erat, contumeliosissimè.”
Pausanias indeed, in i. 2, § 3, quoted by Goettling, asserts that Hesiod, like Homer, basked not in the sunshine of courtly favour, owing to fortune's spite, or set dislike to high places ;
and that this was the case with Hesiod because he had embraced a rural life, and was averse to roaming (ἀγϱοικία̜ καὶ ὄκνψ πλάνης).
But there is nothing inconsistent with this in the supposition that, born at Ascra, he spent his later years in the more kindly and congenial soil of Orchomenus, and there died and was buried.
This is the sum of what we know of Hesiod's life from, the Hesiodic poems, and from probable testimony;
and even this small sum Goettling would fain diminish by a doubt whether the passages referred to are bonâ fide Hesiod's own, and are not rather later additions, based on oral tradition.
It is not needful that we should adopt this view, unless we pre­ fer to be left without a single grain of admitted fact;
whilst on the other hand it is unnecessary to encumber a notice, like the present, with any inquiry into the narratives of Ephorus, and the logographers, Hellanicus, Damastes, and Pherycides,.
and with them to trace up the generations of Hesiod through a given list of ancestors to Orpheus himself;
or to attempt to prove a cousinship between Hesiod and Homer, by making Hesiod's father, Dius, the brother of Mason, the sire of Homer.
There are other fables, applicable, not so much to Hesiod, as to the school of bards, Pierian or Thracian, as contra­ distinguished from the Ionian or Homeric, to which he gave his name.
Such are his second youth (cf. Goettling, p. xiii. præf.) and his double burial, relating to which there is a story in Pausanias (ix. 38, § 3) which reminds us forcibly of the story in Herodotus (i. 67) about the bones of Orestes.
These and the legend of his having met with a violent death near the Locrian Æneon in the territory of Naupactus, de­ tailed by Plutarch, (Conviv. Sept. Saps. xix.,) point indeed to the hero-worship of Hesiod among the Locrians and Boeo- Hians, though they cannot be looked upon as helps towards a more minute biography.
We will now proceed to an account of the poems, or frag- menta of poems, which have been ascribed to Hesiod, or to his school.
These are of three classes:
1. Historical and genea­ logical;
2. Didactic;
3. Short mythical compositions.
For convenience we shall begin with that which is printed first in the ordinary editions, though, according to Wolf, its date is at least one hundred years later than the Works and Days.
The Hesiodic Theogony, or generation, genealogy, and enumer­ ation of the gods, is a work of great importance as giving to us an ancient and genuine attempt of its author or authors “ to cast," in the words of Mr.. Grote, (i. 16,) " the divine fore- time into a systematic sequencer”
If it be an imperfect at tempt, it is yet more connected and coherent than the passing notices of gods and goddesses which are scattered up and down the Iliad and the Odyssey, whilst in the Homeric Hymns we only get a light thrown upon the several deities individu­ ally ;
so that Hesiod stands out to us as the first systematizer of Greek mythology, though that there were other systems is evident from the discrepancies of his account from that of Homer.
Still, as Mr. Grote observes, it was the Hesiodic Theogony—from which doubting Pagans and open foes of Paganism alike drew their subjects of attack, “ so that it is absolutely necessary to recount in their native simplicity the Hesiodic stories, in order to know what it was that Plato deprecated and Zenophanes denounced " (i. 16).
His Theo­ gony, as it has come down to us, is divisible into three parts:
(1.)
The cosmogony, or origin of the world and all the physi­ cal fabric and powers thereof;
and this part, commencing after an exordium, takes up from the 116th to the 452nd line.
Then follows (2.) the Theogony proper, from 453 to 982;
and afterwards (3.) a Heroogony, or generation of he­ roes by immortal sires from mortal mothers, which begins at 963, and breaks off abruptly at 1021 ;
from which point, or rather from the last two verses of the Theogony, it is sup­ posed that a Hesiodic poem, named the “ Eoai,”) or “ Cata­ logues of Women," a lost poem of the first class on the heroines afore-mentioned, commenced.
A careful comparison of the Theogony of Hesiod with that of Homer, (as we gather it from different passages,) instituted by Mr. Grote, assigns to the former a coarser and less deli­ cate fancy than that of the latter, indicative of a later and more advanced age.
He also points to Crete and Delphi as the probable source whence our poet derived his Theogonic system.
Its main variations from the elder account are, the mention of Uranus as an arch-god prior to Cronus, and the legend of Cronus swallowing his children, which it is not improbable that the poet himself learned at Delphi (cf. Theog. 499, 500).
After his deposition by Zeus, Cronus is placed by Hesiod, not, as by Homer, in Tartarus with the rest of the Titans, but in a sort of Elba in the isles of the Blest (cf. Op. et D. 168).
Zeus is in Homer the eldest, in Hesiod the youngest, of the three sons of Cronus.
Aphrodite, the daughter, according to the Iliad, of Zeus and Dione, is in Hesiod (Theog. 188) born of the sea-foam after the mutilation of Cronus, itself a coarser fiction of Hesiodic origin.
The Cyclops of Hesiod are the sons of Uranus, and forge the thunder­ bolts of Jove, whereas in the Odyssey they are but gigantic shepherds having each one central eye in their foreheads, huge and round.
Hesiod, again, mentions three Centimani, Homer only one, namely, Briareus.
And Hesiod's system is moreover diverse from Homer's in the record of the battles between the gods and the Titans, about which the latter is silent, while the former fully describes them, and so has given us one of the finest passages in the whole Theogony.
Altogether we find that the statement of Herodotus, that Homer and Hesiod made the Theogony of the Greeks, is to some extent correct, inasmuch as Homer gives incidental glimpses of an earlier system than Hesiod's :
while Hesiod has with a masterly hand systematized a generation and genealogy of the gods, not gathered from Homer, nor coinciding with it, but at the same time older than the so-called Orphic The­ ogony.
The origin of these Theogonies was, no doubt, a desire to satisfy natural curiosity respecting the rites and services of various gods and their temples:
and, as Mr. Grote observes, the case of Prometheus outwitting Jove as regards the sacrifices, (Hesiod, Theog. 528—561,) is a very striking specimen of this.
Whatever may have been the additions, whatever the hiatus in the Theogony attributed to Hesiod, it must always be most valuable, as the source from which we gather the earliest systematized genealogy, or key to the worship of each god, such as grew out of their various ser­ vices, rites, and ceremonies,-so that at this day we may with Herodot.
ii. 53 recognise in Homer and Hesiod the main authors of Grecian belief, respecting the names, generations, attributes, and agency, the forms and worship, of the gods.
The story of Pandora, which appears also with some vari­ ations in " the Works and Days," will claim a few words, when, after noticing briefly the fragmentary “ Shield of Her­ cules," we conclude with a sketch of Hesiod's best attested poem, the ̓́Εργα καὶ ἡμέϱαι.
The Shield of Hercules" begins with fifty-six verses, which an anonymous grammarian, quoted by Goettling, as­ signs to the 4th Book of the Eoai, or “ Catalogues of Women," to which allusion has been made above.
Next follows a second part, from 57 to 140, continued after an interval from 317 to 480, and containing the encounter of Hercules and Iolaus with Mars and Cycnus, and the discomfiture and death of the last-mentioned;
whilst the verses from 141 to 317 give us a poetic description of the “ Shield of Hercules," naturally introduced into the details of the combat.
It is a somewhat disjointed specimen of the 3rd class of Hesiod's Poems, and the portion, whence its name is derived, is an evident imitation of Homer's description of the “ Shield of Achilles.
"In the first portion of the poem, we hear of Amphitryon, the grandson of Perseus, having slain his uncle Electryon, in a fit of passion about some cattle ;
and the Taphians and Tele­ boans from Acarnania invading Tiryns, and putting Electry­ on's sons to the sword, so that of his whole family only his daughter Alcmena remained.
Amphitryon was to wed her, but not before he had accomplished her vow, and smitten the Teleboans for the slaughter of her brethren.
Starting from Thebes, whither Alcmena had accompanied him from Tiryns into exile for his uncle's death, he achieved the destruction of the Teleboans by aid of the Cadmeans, and Phecians, and Locrians.
(Scut. Here. 12—82).
On his return to Thebes to claim his bride, Jove had been beforehand with him in the husband's form and likeness, ὅφρα θεοι̃σιν Ανδράσι τ’ ἀλφησ- τη̨̃σιν ἀρη̃ς αλκη̃ϱα φυτεύσαι ;
so that in due time Alcmena bore twin sons, Hercules by Jupiter, and Iphicles by Amphitryon.
The other portions of the poem need no further special notice, save the observation that the description of the “ Shield of Hercules" is far more ornate than that of Homer, and dis­ covers an absence of simplicity indicative of a later date :
and that the poem ends with the spoiling of Cycnus by the heroes, after that his powerful patron Mars with Fear and Terror have retired to Olympus, as well as the goddess Athena, to whose aid Hercules had been indebted.
His burial by Ceyx king of Trachys is mentioned, as is the destruction of his tomb, which was swept away by the river Anaurus, at the in­ stigation of Apollo, whose pilgrims Cycnus had been wont to- plunder on the way with holy offerings to Delphi.
The Works and Days (’'Εϱγα icat ἡμέϱαι) was the only poem of Hesiod which, as has been before stated, the Bœo- tians believed to be genuine.
It is of the didactic, or second class of Hesiodic poems, differing much from the other two, which are extant, in the simplicity and soberness of its tone and subjects.
Its principal element is a collection of pre­ cepts, ethical, political, economical, and specially the last.
It is reasonably inferred that the latter part of the title (καὶ ἡμέϱαι) arose from the circumstance of the last seventy-eight verses being a sort of calendar for the agriculturist.
The first ten lines of the poem bear the impress of another hand:
and it has been generally held that three episodes have been inserted in the original didactic poem;
viz. (I.) The Fable of Prometheus and Pandora (47—105) ;
(2.) The Metallic Ages of the World (109—201);
and (3.) the Description of Winter (504—558).
The rest will be found to be a strictly homely inculcation of maxims to men, as touching their duties, moral, social, and political.
The first of these portions, which we have mentioned as of doubtful genuineness, is remarkable as conveying a somewhat different account of the legend of Prometheus and Pandora.
from that in the Theogony.
For the Theogony omits the part which Epimetheus plays in the Works and Days in accepting Pandora at Jove's hands in opposition to the solemn injunc­ tion of his wiser brother Prometheus (Op. et D. 50—85).
Neither is there in the Theogony any mention of the cask of evils, from which Pandora in the Works and Days is made to lift the lid, and so bring mischiefs and diseases into the world.
With reference to the ages of men, metallically distinguished, it is pointed out by Mr. Grote, in the second chapter of his first volume, that there is in this passage supplied what the Theogony fails to give, a narrative of the origin of mankind;
which exactly suits the sober tone of the poem.
We find the gods establishing (1st,) the Golden Race, (Op. et D. 120, seq.,) who after death became guardian demons, the unseen police of the gods, all over the earth;
(2nd,) the Silver, (140, &c.,) who became the blest of the under world;
(3rd,) the Brazen ;
men of hard ash-wood, with brazen arms, who fought to extermination, and in Hades were nameless and un­ privileged ;
(4th,) the Heroic, better than its immediate (pre­ decessors, and made up of the warriors before Troy and 'Thebes, whose after state is in the Isles of the Blest, under the mild sway of Cronus, where they reap unseen fruits three times in the year;
(5th,) the poet’s own contemporaries, the Iron Race and age, (173, Op. etD.,) of whom he says that they have neither Nemesis nor αἰδως, and that Jove will shortly destroy them.
To account for the insertion of an unmetallic race, (No. 4,) Mr. Grote points out a double vein of sentiment pervading the poet's mind:
—an ethical sentiment, guiding his -fancy as to the past, as well as his appreciation of the present, bridging over the chasm between gods and men by antecedent races, the pure, the less pure, the least pure.
But this ethical vein, he says, a mythical vein intersects.
Hesiod could not leave out the divine race of heroes, nor yet identify the warriors before Thebes and Troy with the golden, silver, or brazen age.
As ancestors of all the chief living men of the poet's age, they claimed a nearness to the present generation, and so he finds an unmetallic niche for them between the ages of brass and iron.
Passing by these, and looking generally at the Works and Days, the great interest of the poem consists in its allu­ sions to himself, his history, and his personal wrongs.
In it we cannot fail to be struck by the low opinion which he forms of women, against whom he rails, as we afterwards find Simonides, Archilochus, Bacchylides, and still later Euripides, railing.
Woman was in that day half drudge, half toy to man, and the Scriptural blessing given in the “help-meet” for man was an idea which a Greek could not thoroughly entertain.
The poem is the first of its class, didactic and not heroic, looking inward and forward, upon personal and practical life, not outward on the deeds of the gods and god-descended men of the past.
Here is its especial interest, while a subordinate interest is excited by the consideration that in it we find the model on which Virgil partly framed his Georgics,—another claim for it to the careful perusal of every scholar.
Fragments of other works of Hesiod, or the Hesiodic school, epic, astronomic, and didactic, are to be found at the end of the edition of Goettling ;
and do not need any enumer­ ation here.
It remains to mention the editions consulted in the pre­ sent translation.
They are principally those of Goettling, Van Lennep, Robinson, Gaisford, (in the Poetæ Minores,) and Vollbehr.
The English poetical version of Elton is appended as the best existing, being infinitely more poetical than the miserable attempt of Cook, whilst it is more faithful and literal than that of Chapman.
The works of Hesiod have long deserved an English prose version, to facilitate the general appreciation of one whom the ancients deemed not unworthy to rank with Homer.
May the present translation pave the way, and lead many future students to the charms of the original.
OF a very different date and style is the poet, whose re­ maining works, chiefly of the Hymnic cast, stand next to those of Hesiod in the following translation.
Callimachus was chief librarian of the celebrated library at Alexandria from B. c. 260 to B. C. 240, the date of his death, so that he was a contemporary of Theocritus as well as of Aratus, (cf. Epigr. xxix.,) and like them enjoyed the esteem and patron­ age of Ptolemy Philadelphia.
His extant poetry can hardly be mentioned with the poems of Hesiod, except to point out the contrast between the earliest framer of a Greek Theogony, and the diligent compiler at a much later date of what had been added in the interval.
The hymns are marked by little else than learning and labour, and do not contain much real poetry, or much of interest to sustain a faith, which was daily becoming weakened by the constant extension of its objects of worship.
Callimachus was, as Strabo tells us,(XVII. iii. p. 497,) a mem­ ber of the powerful house at Cyrene, named, from its founder Battus, the Battiadæ ;
and hence he is by Ovid (lb. 53) call­ ed Battiades simply.
Born probably at Cyrene, he became in due course a pupil of the grammarian Hermocrates, under whom he worked with so much assiduity that he seems him­ self to have enjoyed very great celebrity as a grammarian among the Alexandrine school, though of his works in that branch of learning no remains have unfortunately come down to us.
He flourished in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and ended his days in that of Euergetes, his son and successor.
We learn from Aulus Gellius (xvii. 21) that he lived shortly before the first Punic war, and that his wife was a daughter of Euphrates of Syracuse.
He appears to have had a nephew bearing his own name, (the author, according to Suidas, of an epic poem περὶ νήσων,) of whom Lucian (de conscrib.
Hist.) quoted by Spanheim, p. 154, vol. ii. of Ernesti's edition, seems to make mention.
(Cf. also Epigram xxii.)
If Callimachus was not great in the length or the substance of his works,-the first of which positions we may infer from his own Hymn to Apollo, ver. 106—112, where we find him thrusting off a charge seemingly made against him by his for­ mer pupil Apollonius Rhodius (see Spanheim ad loc.);
while the second is evident from a perusal of his hymns, and from the phrase of Propertius, II.
i. 40, “ Angusto pectore Calli­ machus,”—he is by all accounts free from the charge of want of variety in his subjects.
The names or fragments of forty of his works are known to us, and Suidas records that he was the author of 800 works on grammar, history, mytho­ logy, and general literature, as well as hymns, elegies, epi­ grams, and at least one epic.
His prose works are completely lost.
Six of his hymns remain, or, if we adopt Blomfield's view that the Bath of Pallas is, as its metre indicates, an elegy, five;
these are in the Ionic dialect, in hexameters, and are replete with mythical knowledge.
The Bath of Pal­ las is in elegiac verse, and in the Doric dialect.
This, and a translation, or imitation, by Catullus of another elegy of Callimachus, “ de Coma Berenices," a poem in honour of the Queen of Euergetes, whose hair had been made a constella­ tion by the astronomers, are the only remaining evidence for testing the judgment of Quinctilian, that Callimachus was the most eminent elegiac poet of Greece (i. 58).
He was certainly held in high esteem by the Roman poets Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, See Catull.

The epigrams of Callimachus which have come down to us are seventy-three in number, and of various merit, some of them being among the gems of the Greek Anthology, whilst others are poor and meagre.
Of the former we may direct attention to the 2nd, the 5th, the 17th, and the 21st Epigrams, as especially beautiful.
Very elegant and faithful translations of these appear in the Greek Anthology, published by Mr. Bohn.
Among the lost poems of Callimachus, which are often re­ ferred to by later writers, the most famous seem to have been his Αἴτια, an epic poem, (which Propertius calls “nonni flati somnia Callimachi," III.
26, 32, where the word “ somnia ” is explained by Barth, " Quia Callimachus finxerat, somniasse aliquando se intervenisse Musis, quas postea literis mandavit,") and another epic entitled ‛Εκάλη, the hostess of Theseus when he went forth to slay the Bull of Marathon.
The fragments which remain of this poem have been collected and arranged with much learning by A. F. Naeke, Bonn. 1845;
who shows that this poem, which was spoken of as the only long poem of Callimachus, and supposed to have been written in consequence of his being charged with βραχυλογία, was not after all an extraordinarily lengthy production.
An­ other poem of a satirical character remains to be mentioned,- the Ibis, or Stork, an invective against Apollonius Rhodius, who seems to have provoked it by a bitter epigram.
This poem was imitated by Ovid in his poem of the same name, which still remains.
The editions consulted and used for this translation have been the very complete variorum, edited by Ernesti, Leiden, 1761, based on that of Spanheim, and including his erudite and very valuable commentary, and the edition of Bp. Blom­ field, 1815, which, excising much that is superfluous in Er­ nesti, adds the valuable matter of Ruhnken.
Of the two poetic versions of Callimachus, that of Tytler has been preferred for incorporation with this volume.
Dodd's lias considerable merit;
but, all points considered, Tytler seemed most deserving of reproduction.
THE celebrated gnomic poet, whose remains are the con- eluding subject of translation in this volume, was born in the Grecian, not Sicilian, Megara, (cf. Theogn. 781, &c.,) about 570 years before the Christian era.
He speaks in the passage just referred to of a visit across the sea to Sicily, and it would seem from the Scholiast on Plato, (Leg. i. 630, A. vol. vi. p. 21, Ast,) that the true interpretation of the philosopher's words in that passage is that Hyblæan Megara had conferred honorary citizenship upon the poet, on the occasion of his visit.
It would seem that his life was extended till at least B. c. 490, so that he must have witnessed the commencement of the war with Persia;
and there are allusions to the fear of the Median Invasion in ver. 762 and 773.
Taking his life as having fallen between B. c. 570 and 490, he must have drawn his first breath amidst the tumults of the contending factions, which from an earlier period than 630 B. c., the date of the beginning of the tyranny of Theagenes at Megara, had been rending that state.
The despot Theagenes had ascended to power on the shoulders of the people, after the overthrow of the oligarchy which had held the reins from the period of Megara's emancipation from the yoke of Corinth.
The deposition of Theagenes, B. c. 600, by the exiled nobles, aided by the oligarchical Lacedaemoniam, served but to pave the way after a brief tranquillity for a wilder and more violent insurrection of the commonalty, who carried their hatred to the rich so far that they banished some and confiscated their property;
whilst they intruded into the houses and banquets of others, and even passed a decree “ repudiating " their debts to their aristocratic creditors, and requiring the whole in.
terest, which had been already received, to be repaid to them.
In considering this παλιντοκία, (Plut. Quæst. Græc. 18, p. 295,) as it was termed, we are to remember, however, as Mr. Grote suggests, (iii. 60,) the reprobation with which usury was viewed generally by early Greek and Roman society.
The result of this disorderly democracy was, as might be expected, a return of the nobles, and a re-establishment of their supremacy ;
though for a long space revolutions and counter-revolutions distressed the Megarian state, in the midst of which Theognis was born and lived.
Naturally, therefore, we find amidst the “ disjecta membm poetæ " many allusions to this unsettled state of things, now a strong arts- tocratic appeal (for Theognis was himself one of the nobles) to the leading men of his party ;
at another time an outpouring of despair at the failure of an onslaught of the nobles upon the commons;
and at another the querulous laments of an exile from his father-land;
as well as here and there a concession to expediency for a season, indicated by a sup­ pression of his party feelings.
Again, in other places we find him complaining of the loss of his property by the betrayal of his own friends and companions (262, 349, 512, 600, 828, &c.).
Greatly annoyed by the intermixture of ranks conse­ quent on these revolutions, and the re-distributions of pro­ perty, Theognis is found also complaining generally of the in­ termarriage of good (i. e. noble) men with the daughters of the bad, (i. e. base,) 189—192, &c.;
and specially of a slight to himself on the part of aristocratic parents, who, for in­ terest or lucre, have wedded their daughter to a churl, “ πολ- λόν ἐμου̃ κακίων” (262).
From his picture it would seem that the base-born had been gainers by the revolutions, chang­ ing their goat-skins and country-huts for citizenship and wealth (cf. 349).
Mr. Grote is of opinion that there is no ground for Welcker's statement that the land of the state had been formally re-divided, though the revolution had strength­ ened the “ bad rich,” and depressed the " good and virtuous," with ruinous effects to the fortunes of Theognis.
The political and most of the moral verses are addressed to Cyrnus, son of Polyps!, the word Πολυπαι̑δης being now ge­ nerally allowed to be a patronymic (cf. Muller, Hist. Gr. Lit. c. x. § 14, note).
This person seems to have gained con­ siderable influence in public affairs, and to have been in Theognis's eyes the " coming man" who was to re-estab­ lish order.
This same individual appears, from ver. 805, &c., (Gaisford,) to have been of age and rank enough to be a θεώϱος, or sacred envoy to Delphi;
and the poet ad­ dresses him always as one on whom the hopes of his party are set, though not without gloomy forebodings as to the issue, arising out of the feebleness and irresolution of the other chiefs of that party.
We have bitter lines addressed to him (cf. 845) in a speech of the poet at a meeting of the aristo­ cratic party:
and a description of the march on Megara of the troops of some neighbouring state, in aid of the demo­ cratic party (cf. 549—554).
After this the poet seems to have retired to Euboea, and thence to Thebes.
Many frag­ ments of great beauty touch upon the miseries of exile, not unsoothed, however, as he testifies (1223) to himself and to his friend Cyrnus, by the charms of conjugal affection.
Per­ haps some of the fragments (e. g. 881, &c.) refer to a resi­ dence shortly after in Sicily;
while Sparta, a congenial quarter as far as aristocratic feelings were concerned, is shown in ver. 1067, &c., and at ver. 875, to have given him an asylum, and that too without the restrictions which en­ forced on natives of the soil the laws of Lycurgus.
His return to his country, and his party's triumph, are the sub­ jects of two fragments, placed by the accomplished trans­ lator, whose poetical version is appended to this edition, at the close of his volume:
and are indicative of this event being about the time of the Persian invasion.
Besides Simonides, who was probably not the poet, but president of an aristocratic Megarian club, and Onomacritus, (not the famous Athenian, but a boon companion of the poet,) other friends, probably connected with the same club, are mentioned or addressed by him in various fragments, por­ tions, it is supposed, of special elegies to each.
Welcker has very elaborately re-arranged and restored to their supposed original order the extant fragments, rejecting, first, all verses positively assigned by the ancients to other poets :
secondly, all parodies of existing gnomæ of Theognis.
He, thirdly, collects all passages referring to special persons, places, seasons, and events:
and, fourthly, classes the συμπό- τικα or convivial poetry.
In the fifth class he ranges the ad­ dresses to Polypaides;
erring in this point, because he does not recognise the identity of this patronymic with Cyrnus.
Lastly, he places the παιδικά, many of which are blemishes, as Suidas has observed, on the poet's general poetical character, and are besides of very questionable genuineness.
Of course the arrangement of the fragments by Welcker is to a certain extent arbitrary, as is also the attempt of Mr. Frere in his “Theognis Restitutus" to re-arrange and reduce to system the scattered fragments of our author.
To both we owe a debt of gratitude:
to the former for the deep learn­ ing of his Prolegomena, and the labour bestowed upon the systematizing of the remains of Theognis;
to the latter fbr a most ingenious attempt to frame an autobiography of The­ ognis, at once lively and scholar-like, out of a mass of pass­ ages disconnected.
The chief charm of the poet lies in the light he throws upon the circumstances and crises of the period during which he lived and wrote;
and both Welcker and Mr. Frere have done much to elucidate, much to present in a clever and pro­ bable grouping, the persons, places, and events connected with the state of Megara, between B. c. 570 and 490, as depicted by Theognis.
The editions of Welcker and of Gaisford have been used for this translation, and the order of the verses is that of Gaisford.
The translator is indebted for some useful re­ marks to an able article on Frere's Theognis Restitutus, in the Quarterly Review, No. 144, pp. 452—473, and to an­ other in the Ist volume of the Classical Museum, (263—266,) by Sir G. C. Lewis.
BEGIN we to sing with the Heliconian Muses,.
who keep* safe the spacious and divine mount of Helicon, and also with delicate feet dance about the violet-hued fount and altars of the mighty son of Cronos :
4 and likewise having bathed their soft skins in the Permessus,5 or Hippoerene,6 or sacred Olmius, are wont1 to institute on the top of Helicon choral dunces, beautiful and lovely, and move nimbly with their feet.
Then starting thence, shrouded in thick darkness,2 by night 3 they are wont to wend their way, uttering sounds exceeding sweet, while they celebrate aegis-bearing Jove, and majestic Juno, the Argive goddess, treading-proudly in golden sandals;
and gleaming-eyed Athene, daughter of ægis-bearing Jove ;
Phœbus Apollo ;
Artemis, arrow-queen ;
and earth-encompass­ ing, earth-shaking Poseidon;
august Themis;
Aphrodite shooting-lively-glances;
and Hebe 4 of-the-golden-crown ;
and fair Dione ;
Aurora, and the great Sun, and the resplendent Moon ;
Latona, and Iapetus,5 and wily Cronos;
Earth, mighty Ocean, and dark Night, and the holy race of other ever-living immortals, who erst taught Hesiod a lovely song, 1 as he fed his lambs beneath divine Helicon.
But first of all the god­ desses, the Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, addressed me in a speech such as this:
"
Ye shepherds, dwelling a-field, base subjects for reproach, nought but gluttons,2 we know to sing3 many fictions like to truths, and we know, when we will, to speak what is true.
"Thus said the daughters, ready-in-speech, of mighty Jove, and gave me4 as a staff a branch of very luxuriant olive to— pluck, (a branch) wondrous to behold;
and breathed into me a voice divine, that I might sing of both the future5 and the past.
And they bade me hymn the race of ever-living blessed gods, but first and last6 ever to sing of themselves.
Yet why should these tales be told by me touching the sacred oak,7 or rock ?
Come thou Begin we with the Muses, who, as they sing, delight the great spirit of Jove, their sire, within Olympus, telling of the present, and the future, and the past, according in their voice ;
and from their lips sweet speech flows ceaselessly, whilst the halls of loud-thundering Jove, their sire, are glad2 at the delicate utterance 3 of the goddesses, as it is diffused around:
and the top of snowy Olympus rings, and the mansions of the immortals.
They then uttering di­ vine sounds first celebrate in song the august race of the gods, whom from the beginning Earth and broad Heaven pro­ duced:
the gods who sprang from these, givers of good gifts ;
4 and then next, Jove, sire of gods and men likewise, the goddesses chaunt as they begin, and chaunting him cease from their song, how most excellent he is of the gods, and mightiest in strength.
And next the Olympian Muses,5 daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, gladden Jove's spirit within Olympus, by singing of the race of heroes,6 and mighty giants ;
the Muses I say, whom Mnemosyne, guardian over the corn-lands of Eleuther,7 bare, after union with their sire, the son of Cronus, in Pieria, to be a means of oblivion of ills, and a rest from cares.
For during nine nights did the coun­ sellor Jove associate with her, apart from the other immortals, ascending her holy bed :
but when at length, I ween, it was the year,2 and the seasons had revolved towards the end of the months, and many days had been completed, then she bare nine accordant daughters, whose care is song,3 possessing, as they do, in their bosoms a mind at ease, but a little distance from the highest peak of snowy Olympus, where are their bright spots-for-dancing 4 and fair abodes.
And beside them the Graces and Cupid too have dwellings at festivals,5 and pouring through their lips a lovely voice, they chaunt the attri­ butes,6 and celebrate the wise ways of all the immortals, utter­ ing an exceeding-lovely voice.
And they then7 went to Olympus, exulting in their beau­ tiful voice, in their immortal song, and around them, as they sang, dark earth was re-echoing, and a winsome sound arose from their feet, as they wended to their sire:
But he reigns in Olympus,8 having in his own disposal the thunder and the glowing bolt, since he hath conquered by might his father, Cronus.
And duly to the immortals bath he arranged each office at once, and declared their prerogatives.
Thus, I wot, the Muses tenanting Olympian homes are wont to sing, nine daughters born of mighty Jove, Clio, Euterpe, Thalia, and Melpomene, Terpsichore and Erato;
Polymnia, Urania, and Calliope :
1 and she is eldest of them all.
For she also attends in the company of august kings.
Whomsoever of Jove-reared sovereigns the daughters of great Jove shall have honoured and looked upon at his birth,2 on the tongue of such an one they shed a honeyed dew, and from his lips drop gentle words ;
so then the peoples all look to him, as he decideth questions of laW3 with righteous judg­ ments ;
and he speaketh-counsels unerringly,4 and quickly stays with wisdom a strife however great.
5
For therefore are kings wise,6 in that for their peoples, when misled in the forum, they easily accomplish the reversal of their acts, ex­ horting them with soft words.
And as he goes through the city they propitiate him as a god with gentle awe, and he is conspicuous among them when assembled, as is the sacred gift of the Muses among men.
Since from the Muses and far-shooting Apollo are men of song, and harpers over the earth, but from Jove spring kings :
yet happy he whomso­ ever the Muses shall have loved ;
sweet is the sound that flows from his mouth.
For suppose one, even having grief in his fresh sorrowing spirit, pines away troubled at heart, yet if a minstrel, servant of the Muses, shall have chaunted the glories of men of yore, and the blessed gods, who hold Olym­ pus, quickly does he forget his melancholy, nor does he at all remember his cares ;
l and quickly have the gifts of the gods diverted them.
Hail!
daughters of Jove;
and give the lovely song.
And sing the sacred race of immortals ever-existing, who sprang from Earth and starry Heaven, and murky Night, whom the briny Deep nourished.
Say, too, how at the first the gods and earth were born, and rivers and boundless deep, rushing with swollen stream,3 and shining stars, and the broad Heaven above;
and the gods who were sprung from these, givers of good gifts ;
and say how they divided their wealthy and how they apportioned their honours, and how at the first they oc­ cupied Olympus with-its-many-ravines.
Tell me these things, ye Muses, abiding in Olympian homes from the beginning, and say ye what was the first of them that rose.
In truth then foremost sprang Chaos,5 and next broad- bosomed6 Earth, ever secure seat of all the immortals, who inhabit the peaks of snow-capt Olympus, and dark dim Tar­ tarus in a recess of Earth having-broad-ways, and Love, who is most beautiful among immortal gods, Love that re­ laxes the limbs, 1 and in the breasts of all gods and all men, subdues their reason and prudent counsel.
But from Chaos were born Erebus and black Night ;
and from Night again sprang forth Æther and Day, whom she bare after having conceived, by union with Erebus 2 in love.
And Earth, in sooth, bare first indeed like to herself (in size) starry Heaven, that he might shelter her around on all sides, that so she might be ever a secure seat for the blessed gods:
and she brought forth vast mountains, lovely haunts of deities, the Nymphs who dwell along the woodland hills.
She too bare also the barren Sea, rushing with swollen stream, the Deep, I mean, without delightsome love:
but afterward, having bedded with Heaven, she bare deep-eddying Ocean, Cæus and Crius, Hyperion and Iapetus,4 Then and Rhea, Themis, Mne- mosyne, and Phœbe with golden coronet, and lovely Tethys.
1
And after these was born, youngest, wily Cronus,2 most savage of their children;
and he hated his vigour-giving 3 sire.
Then brought she forth next the Cyclops,4 having an over-bearing spirit, Brontes, and Steropes, and stout-hearted Arges,5 who both gave to Jove his thunder, and forged his lightnings.
Now these, in sooth, were in other respects, it is true, like to gods, but a single eye was fixed in their mid-foreheads.
And they from immortals grew up speaking mortals, and Cyclops was their appropriate name,6 because, I wot, in their foreheads one circular eye was fixed.
Strength, force, and contrivances were in their works.
But again, from Earth and Heaven sprung other three sons, great and mighty, scarce to be mentioned,1 Cottus and Briareus and Gyas, children ex­ ceeding proud.
From the shoulders of these moved actively an hundred hands, not brooking approach, and to each above sturdy limbs there grew fifty heads from their shoulders.
Now monstrous strength is powerful, joined with vast size.
For of as many sons as were born of Earth and Heaven, they were the fiercest,2 and were hated by their sire from the very first:
as soon as any of these was born, he would hide them all,3 and not send them up to the light, in a cave of the earth, and Heaven exulted over the work of mischief, whilst huge Earth inly groaned, straitened as she was;
and she devised a subtle and evil scheme.
For quickly having produced a stock of white iron,4 she forged a large sickle, and gave the word to her children, and said encouragingly, though troubled in her heart:
" Children of me and of a sire madly violent, if ye would obey me, we shall avenge the baneful in­ jury of your father;
for he was the first that devised acts of indignity."
So spake she, but fear seized on them all, I wot, nor did any of them speak ;
till, having gathered courage, great and wily Cronus bespake his dear5 mother thus in reply:
"
Mother, this deed at any rate I will undertake and accom­ plish, since for our sire, in sooth, of-detested-name,1 I care not;
for he was the first that devised acts of indignity.
"Thus spake he, and huge Earth rejoiced much at heart, and hid and planted him in ambush:
in his hand she placed a sickle with jagged teethe and suggested to him all the stra­ tagem.
Then came vast Heaven bringing Night with him, and, eager for love, brooded around Earth, and lay stretched, I wot, on all sides :
but his son from out his ambush grasped at him3 with his left hand, whilst in his right he took the huge sickle, long and jagged-toothed, and hastily mowed off the genitals of his sire, and threw them back to be carried away behind4 him.
In nowise vainly slipped they from his hand ;
for as many gory drops as ran thence, Earth received them all;
and when the years rolled round,5 she gave birth to stern Furies,6 and mighty giants, gleaming in arms, with long spears in hand, and Nymphs whom men call Ashnymphs,7 (Meliæ,) over the boundless earth.
But the genitals, as after first severing them with the steel he had cast them into the heaving sea from the continent,8 so kept drifting long time up and down the deep, and all around kept rising a white foam from the immortal flesh ;
and in it a maiden was nourished;
1 first she drew nigh divine Cythera, and thence came next to wave- washed Cyprus.
Then forth stepped an awful, beauteous god­ dess ;
and beneath her delicate feet the verdure throve around :
2 her gods and men name Aphrodite, the foam-sprung goddess, and fair-wreathed Cytherea—the first because she was nursed in foam, but Cytherea, because she touched at Cythera;
and Cyprus-born, because she was born in wave-dashed Cyprus.
3
And her Eros accompanied and fair Desire followed, when first she was born, and came into the host of the gods.
And from the beginning this honour hath she, and this part hath she obtained by lot among men and immortal gods, the amor­ ous converse of maidens, their smiles and wiles, their sweet delights, their love, and blandishment.
Now those4 sons, their father, mighty Heaven, called by surname Titans, up­ braiding those whom he had himself begotten;
and he was wont to say that, out-stretching their hands5 in infatuation, they had wrought a grave act, but that for it there should be vengeance hereafter.
'
Night bare 2 also hateful Destiny, and black Fate, and Death:
she bare Sleep likewise,3 she bare the tribe of dreams;
these did the goddess, gloomy Night, bear after union with none.
Next again Momus,4 and Care full-of-woes, and the Hespe­ rides,5 whose care are the fair golden apples beyond the famous ocean, and trees yielding fruit;
and she produced the Destinies,6 and ruthlessly punishing Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, who assign to men at their births to have good and evil;
who also pursue transgressions both of men and gods, nor do the goddesses ever cease from dread wrath, be­ fore that, I wot, they have repaid sore vengeance to him, whosoever shall have sinned.
Then bare pernicious Night Nemesis7 also, a woe to mortal men :
and after her she brought forth Fraud, and Wanton-love,8 and mischievous Old Age, and stubborn-hearted Strife.
But odious Strife gave birth to grievous Trouble, and Oblivion, and Famine, and tearful Woes, Contests and Slaughters,1 Fights and Homicides, Contentions, Falsehoods, Words, Disputes, Lawlessness and Ruin,2 intimates one of the other, and the Oath, which most hurts men on the earth, whensoever one has sworn voluntarily a perjured oath.
And Pontus begat trusty and truthful Nereus,3 eldest indeed of his children, but men call him old,4 because he is unerring - as well as mild, neither doth he forget the laws, but knoweth just and gentle purposes.
And next again, by union with Earth, great Thaumas,5 and strong Phorcys, and Ceto6 with fair-cheek, and Eurybia, having in her breast a soul of ada­ mant.
From Nereus and fair-haired Doris, daughter of Ocean, perfect stream, sprung lovely daughters of goddesses7 in the barren sea, Proto, Eucrante, Sao, and Amphitrite;
Eudora, Thetis, Galene, Glance, Cymothoe, Spio, Thoe, and charming Halia;
graceful Melita, and Eulimene, and Agave, Pasithea, Erato and rosy-armed Eunice, Doto and Proto, Pherusa, and Dynamene, Nesæa, and Actæa, and Protomedia, Doris and Panope, and beauteous Galatea, lovely Hippothoe, and rosy- armed Hipponoe, and Cymotboe, who along with Cymatolege, and neat-ankled Amphitrite, calms with ease the waves on the misty sea, and the blasts of violent winds ;
Cymo and Eione, and Halimede with beauteous wreath, and blithe Glau­ conome, and Pontoporia, Liagore, Evagore, Laomedia, Poly- Dome, Autonoe, and Lysianassa, and Evarne, both lovely in shape and in beauty faultless, and Psamathe, graceful in per­ son, and divine Menippe, Neso, Eupompe, Themisto, Pronoe, and Nemertes, who hath the mind of her immortal sire.
1
These were born of blameless Nereus, fifty maidens, versed in blameless labours.
And Thaumas2 wedded Electra, daughter of deep-flowing Ocean:
she bare rapid Iris, and the fair-tressed Harpies,3 Aello and Ocypete, who, I ween, accompany the wind-blasts and birds, with swift wings, for they are wont to fly high above the earthy But to Phorcys next Ceto of-fair-cheek bare the Grææ,2 gray from their birth, whom in truth im­ mortal gods as well as men walking on the ground call Grææ;
namely, Pephredo handsomely-clad, and Enyo of saffron-vest­ ment, and the Gorgons, who dwell beyond famous Ocean,3 in the most remote quarter night-ward, where are the clear- voiced Hesperides,4 Stheno,5 Euryale, and Medusa having- suffered sadly.
The latter was mortal, but they, the other two, were immortal and ageless, and it was with the one (Medusa) that the azure-haired god lay in the soft meadow, and amid the flowers of spring.
From her too when, as the tale is, Perseus6 had cut off the head, up sprang huge Chry­ saor and the steed Pegasus.
To the latter came his name;
because I wot he was born near the springs of Ocean,7 whilst the other had a golden falchion in his hands.
And he indeed, winging his flight away, left Earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the immortals ;
in Jove's house he dwells, bearing to counsellor Jove thunder and lightning.
1 But Chrysaor, by union with Callirhoe, daughter of famous Ocean, begat three- headed Geryon.
Him indeed then mighty Hercules spoiled, amidst his trailing-footed oxen in sea-girt Erythia,2 even on that day when he drove the broad-browed oxen to sacred Tiryns, having crossed the path of Ocean, and having slain beyond famous Ocean Orthus, and the herdsman Eurytion in a dusky stall.
And she3 brought forth another monster, irresistible, nowise like to mortal men, or immortal gods, in a hollow cavern ;
the divine stubborn-hearted Echidna, [half nymph, with dark eyes and fair cheeks;
and half, on the other hand, a serpent huge, and terrible, and vast,] 4 speckled, and flesh-devouring, 'neath caves of sacred Earth.
For there is her cavern, deep under a hollow rock, afar from immortal gods as well as mortal men :
there I ween have the gods assigned to her famous mansions to inhabit.
But she, the destructive Echidna. was confined in Arima5 beneath the earth, a nymph immortal, and all her days insensible to age.
With her they say that Typhaon1 associated in love, a terrible and lawless2 ravisher for the dark-eyed maid.
And she, having conceived, bare fierce-hearted children.
The dog Orthus3 first she bare for Geryon, and next, in the second place, she brought forth the irresistible and ineffable flesh-devourer Cerberus, dog of hell, t with brazen voice4 and with fifty heads, a bold and strong beast.
Thirdly, again she gave birth to the Lernæan Hydra subtle in destruction, whom Juno, white-armed goddess, reared, implacably hating6 the mighty Hercules.
And it Jove's son, Hercules, named of Amphitryon, along with warlike Iolaus,7 and by the counsels of Pallas the despoiler, slaughter­ ed with ruthless sword.
But she (Echidna) bare Chimaera, breathing resistless fire, fierce and huge, fleet-footed as well as strong:
this monster had three heads:
one indeed of a grim-visaged lion, one of a goat, and another of a serpent, a fierce dragon;
in front a lion, a dragon behind, and in the midst a goat;
breathing forth the dread strength of burning fire.
Her Pegasus9 slew and brave Bellerophon.
But she,1 compelled by Orthus, brought forth in sooth the destructive Spinx, a destruction to the Cadmaeans;
and the Nemæan lion, whom I wot Juno, Jove's glorious consort, reared, and settled in the corn-lands of Nemæa, a woe to man­ kind.
There abiding truly used he to devour the tribes of men, whilst he held sway over Tretus2 of Nemæa, and over Apesas:
but him the might of strong Hercules subdued.
And Ceto mingling in love with Phorcys, brought forth, as young­ est-born, a terrible serpent,3 which in hiding-places of dark earth, guards all-golden apples, in wide bounds.
Such then is the brood of Ceto and Phorcys.
But Tethys to Oceanus bare eddying rivers:
Nile and Alpheus, and deep-eddying Eridanus, Strymon, and Maeander and Ister of-fair-stream, Phasis, Rhesus, and Achelous with silvery-tide, Nessus, and Rhodius, Haliacmon and Heptaporus, Granicus, Æsepus, and divine Simois, Peneus, Hermus, and pleasant-flowing Caicus;
and vast Sangarius, Ladon, Parthenius, Evenus, and Ardescus and divine Scamander.
And she bare a sacred race of daughters, who with King Apollo and the rivers all earth over bring up men to manhood,1 and have this prerogative from Jupiter, namely, Pitho, Admete, Ianthe, Electra, Doris and Prymno, and goddess-like Urania, Hippo, and Clymene, Rhodia, and Callirhoe, Zeuxo and Clytia, Idya and Pasithoe, Plexaure, Galaxaure, lovely Dione, Melobosis, and Thoe, and fair Polydora, and Circeis in nature amiable, and bright- eyed Pluto, Perseis, lanira, Acaste, and Xanthe, and winsome Petræa, Menesto, and Europa, Metis, Eurynome, and saffron- robed Telesto, Crenæis, Asia as well as desire-kindling Ca­ lypso, Eudora, Tyche, Amphiro, and Ocyroë, and Styx, who truly is eldest of them all.
2
Now these were born eldest daughters of Oceanus and Tethys ;
there are, however, many others also:
3 for thrice a thousand are the tapering-ankled Ocean-nymphs, who truly spreading far and near, bright children of the gods, haunt everywhere alike earth and the depths of the lake.
4
And again, as many other rivers5 flowing with a ringing noise, sons of Ocean, whom august Tethys bare:
of all of whom 'twere difficult for mortal man to tell the names, but each individual knows them, of as many as dwell around them.
And Thia,1 overcome in the embrace of Hyperion, brought forth the great Sun, and bright Moon, and Morn, that shines for all that- dwell-on-the-earth, and for immortal gods, who occupy broad heaven.
Eurybia2 too, a goddess among goddesses, bare to Crius, after union in love, huge Astræus, and Pallas, and Perses, who was transcendent in all sciences.
And to Astræus Morn brought forth the strong-spirited winds, Argestes,3 Ze­ phyr, swift-speeding Boreas, and Notus, when she, a goddess, had mingled in love with a god.
And after them the goddess of morning produced the star Lucifer, and the brilliant stars wherewith the heaven is crowned.
4And Styx, daughter of Ocean, after union with Pallas, bare within the house Zelus and beauteous-ankled5 Victory;
and she gave birth to Strength and Force, illustrious children, whose mansion is not apart from Jove, nor is there any seat, or any way, where the god does not go before them;
but eve!
sit they beside deep-thundering Jupiter.
For thus counselled Styx, imperishable Ocean-nymph, what time the Olympian Lightener summoned all the immortal gods to broad Olympus, and said that whoso of the gods would fight with him against the Titans, none of them would he rob of his rewards,1 but each should have the honour, to wit, that which he had afore­ time among the immortal gods.
And he said that him, who was unhonoured or ungifted by Cronus, he would stablish in honour, and rewards, according to justice.
Then first I wot came imperishable Styx to Olympus along with her children through the counsels of her sire.
And Jove honoured her, and gave her exceeding gifts.
For her he ordained to be the great Oath-witness2 of the gods, and her children to be dwellers-with-her3 all their days.
And even in such wise as he promised, he performed to them all for ever:
for he hath power and reigns mightily.
And next
Phœbe came to the much-beloved couch of Cœus:
4 then in truth having conceived, a goddess by love of a god, she bare dark-robed Latona,5 ever mild, gentle to mortals and immortal gods, mild from the beginning, most kindly within Olympus.
And she bare renowned Asteria, whom erst Perses led to an ample palace to be called his bride.
1
And she, be­ coming pregnant, brought forth Hecate,2 whom Jove, the son of Cronus, honoured beyond all:
and provided for her splendid gifts, to Mit, to hold a share of earth and of barren sea.
But she has obtained honour also from starry Heaven, and has been honoured chiefly by immortal gods.
For even now when any­ where some one of men upon-the-earth duly propitiates them by doing worthy sacrifice, he calls on Hecate:
and abundant honour very speedily attends him, whose vows the goddess shall receive, that is to say, graciously, yea, and to him she presents wealth, for she has the power.
For as many as were born of Earth and Heaven, and received a share of honour, of all these she has the lot, neither did the son of Cronus force any portion from her, nor did he take away as many honours as she had obtained by lot, among the elder gods, the Titans, but she hath them, as at the first the distribution was from the beginning.
Nor, because she is sole-begotten,3 has the god­ dess obtained less of honour, and her prerogative on earth, and in heaven, and sea, but even still much more, seeing that Jove honours her.
And to whom she wills,4 she is greatly present, and benefits Aim, and he is distinguished, whom she may will, in the forum among the people;
and when men arm for mor­ tal-destroying war, then the goddess draws nigh to whom she will, kindly to proffer victory and to extend renown to them :
and in judgment she sits beside august kings:
and propitiouslyl again, when men contend in the games, there the goddess stands near these also, and helps them.
And when he has conquered by strength and might, a man carries with ease a noble prize,2 and rejoicingly presents glory to his parents.
Propitious is she also to be present with horsemen, whom she will;
and to them who ply the rough silvery main ;
3 and they pray to Hecate and the loud-sound­ ing Earth-shaker.
Easily too the glorious goddess presents an ample spoil, and easily is she wont to withdraw it when it is shown, that is, if she is so disposed in her mind.
And (propitious along with Mercury to increase the flock4 in the folds) the herds of cattle, and the droves, and broad herds of goats, and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she choose in her heart, she makes great from small, and is wont to make less from being many.
Thus, in truth, though being sole-begotten from her mother, she has been honoured with rewards amidst all the immortals.
And the son of Cronus made her the nursing.
mother-of-children, who after her have beheld with their eyes the light of far-seeing Morn.
Thus is sAe from the beginning nursing-mother, and such are her honours.
1 Rhea too, embraced by Cronus, bare renowned children, Vesta, Demeter, and Herè of-the-golden-sandals, and mighty Hades, who inhabits halls beneath the earth, having a ruthless heart;
and loud-resounding Neptune, and counselling Jupiter, father of gods as well as men, by whose thunder also the broad earth quakes.
2
And them indeed did huge Cronus de­ vour,3 namely, every one who came to the mother's knees from her holy womb, with this intent, that none other of the illustrious heaven-born might hold royal honour among the immortals.
For he had heard from Earth and starry
Heaven that it was fated for him, strong though he was, to be subdued by his own child,4 through the counsels of mighty Jove:
wherefore he did not keep a careless watch, but lying in wait for them, kept devouring his own sons;
whilst a grief not-to-be-for­ gotten possessed Rhea.
But when at length she was about to bear Jove, the sire of gods as well as men, then it was that she essayed to supplicate her parents dear, Earth and starry Heaven, to contrive a plan how she might without observation bring forth her son, and take vengeance on the furies of their sire, against his children,5 whom great and wily Cronus de­ voured.
But they duly heard and complied with their dear daughter, and explained to her as much as it had been fated should come to pass concerning king Croons, and his strong-hearted son.
And they sent her to Lyctus,1 to the fertile tract of Crete, when I wot she was about to bear the youngest of her sons, mighty Jove:
whom indeed vast Earth received from her to rear and nurture in broad Crete.
Thereupon indeed came she, bearing him through the swift dark night, to Lyctus first, and took him in her hands2 and hid him in a deep3 cave, 'neath the recesses of the divine earth, in the dense and wooded Ægean mount.
But to the great prince,4 the son of Heaven, former sovereign of the gods, she gave a huge stone, having wrapped it in swathes:
which he then took in his bands, and stowed away into his belly, wretch as he was, nor did he consider in his mind that against him for the future his own invincible and untroubled5 son was left instead of a stone, who was shortly about to subdue him by strength of hand, and to drive him from his honours, and himself to reign among the immortals.
Quickly then, I ween, throve the spirit6 and beauteous limbs of the king, and, as years came round, having been beguiled by the wise counsels of Earth, huge Cronus, wily counsellor, let loose again his offspring, having been conquered by the arts and strength of his son.
And first he disgorged the stone, since he swallowed it last.
1
This stone Jove fixed down upon the earth with-its-broad-ways, in divine Pytho, beneath the clefts of Parnassus, to be a monument thereafter, a marvel to mortal men.
Then he loosed from destructive bonds his father's brethren, the sons of Heaven, whom his sire had bound in his folly.
2
Who showed gratitude to him for his kindnesses, and gave him the thunder, and the smoking bolt, and lightning;
but aforetime huge Earth had bidden them:
trusting on these, he rules over mortals and immortals.
Iapetus, moreover, wedded the damsel Clymene,3 a fair- ankled Oceanid, and ascended into a common bed.
And she bare him Atlas, a stout-hearted son, and brought forth ex­ ceeding-famous Menætius, and artful Prometheus,4 full of various wiles, and Epimetheus of-erring-mind, who was from the first an evil to gain-seeking men:
for he first, I wot, re­ ceived from Jove the clay-formed woman, a virgin.
But the insolent Menætius wide-seeing Jove thrust down to Erebus, having stricken him with flaming lightning, on account of his arrogance, and overweening strength.
But Atlas!
upholds broad Heaven by strong necessity, be. fore the clear-voiced Hesperides, standing on earth's verge, with head and unwearied hands.
For this lot counselling Jove apportioned to him.
And wily-minded Prometheus he bound in indissoluble bonds, with painful chains, having thrust them through the middle of a column.
2
And he urged against him an eagle with-wings-outspread :
but it kept feeding on his immortal liver, whilst it would increase to a like size all- round by night, to what the eagle with-wings-outspread had eaten during the whole day before.
This bird indeed, I wot, Hercules, valiant son of fair-ankled Alcmene, slew, and re­ pelled from the son of Iapetus3 the baneful pest, and released him from his anxieties, not against the wishes of high-reigning Olympian Jove, that so the renown of Thebes-sprung Her­ cules might be yet more than aforetime over the many-feeding earth.
Thus, I ween, he honours his very famous son,4 through veneration for him:
and though incensed, ceased from the wrath which he was before cherishing, because he strove in plans against the almighty son of Cronus.
For when gods and mortal men were contending at Mecone,1 then did be set before him a huge ox, having divided it with ready mind, studying to deceive2 the wisdom of Jove.
For here, on the one hand,3 he deposited the flesh and entrails with rich fat on the hide, having covered it with the belly of the ox;
4 and there, on the other hand, he laid down, having well disposed them with subtle art, the white bones of the ox, covering them with white fat.
Then it was that the sire of gods and men addressed him, " Son of Iapetus, far-famed among all kings, how unfairly, good friend, you have divided the por­ tions."
Thus spake rebukingly Jupiter, skilled in imperish­ able counsels.
And him in his turn wily Prometheus address­ ed, laughing low, but he was not forgetful of subtle art:
" Most glorious Jove, greatest of ever-living gods, choose which of these your inclination within your breast bids you."
He spake, I ween, in subtlety:
but Jove knowing imperish­ able counsels was aware, in soothe and not ignorant of his guile;
and was boding in his heart evils to mortal men, which also were about to find accomplishment.
Then with both hands lifted he up the white fat.
But he was incensed in mind, and wrath came around him in spirit, when he saw the white bones of the ox arranged with guileful art.
And thenceforth the tribes of men on the earth burn to the im­ mortals white bones1 on fragrant altars.
Then cloud-com­ pelling Jove addressed him, greatly displeased:
" Son of Iapetus, skilled in wise plans beyond all, you do not, good sir, I wot, yet forget subtle art."
Thus spake in his wrath Jove knowing imperishable counsels:
from that time forward in truth, ever mindful of the fraud, he did not give the strength of untiring fire to wretched mortal men, who dwell upon the earth.
But the good son of Iapetus cheated him,2 and stole the far- seen splendour of untiring fire in a hollow fennel-stalk;
but it stung high-thundering Jove to his heart's core, and incensed his spirit, when he saw the radiance of fire conspicuous among men.
Forthwith then wrought he evil for men in requital for the fire bestowed.
For from the earth the famous Vulcan, halting in both feet, fashioned3 the image of a modest maiden, through the counsels of the son of Cronus.
And the goddess glancing-eyed Minerva girded and arrayed her in silver-white raiment;
and from her head she held with her bands.
a curiously embroidered veil, a marvel to look upon:
and Pallas Athene placed around her about her head lovely garlands fresh-budding with meadow-flowers, and around her bead she set a golden coronet,5 which renowned Vulcan lame with both feet had made himself, having wrought it carefully by hand, out of compliment to Jove his sire.
On it had been wrought many curious monsters, a marvel to view, as many as in great abundance the continent and the sea maintain.
Many of these he introduced, (and much elegance beamed from it,) of wondrous beauty, like to living animals gifted with sounds.
But when he had wrought a beauteous evil1 instead of good, he led her forth even where were the rest of gods and men, exulting as sAe was in the adornment of the gleaming- eyed daughter-of-a-strong-father:
and wonder seized immortal gods as well as mortal men, when they beheld a deep snare, against which man's arts are vain.
Now from her is the race of tender women.
2
For from her is a pernicious race, and tribes of women, a great source of hurt, dwell along with mor­ tal men,3 helpmates not of consuming poverty, but of surfeit.
And as when in close-roofed hives bees feed drones, sharers in bad works,4 the former through the whole day till sunset are busy day by day, and make white combs, whilst the latter, remaining within in the close-roofed hives, reap the labours of others for their own maws.
Just so to mortal men high-thundering Jove gave women as an evil, helpmates of painful toils:
another evil too did he provide instead of good;
to Mit, whosoever shunning mar­ riage and the ills that women work, declines to marry, and has come to old age pernicious,1 through want of one to tend his latter days;
he lives not, it is true, in lack of subsistence, but, when he is dead, distant kindred divide his possessions:
whilst to whomsoever, on the other hand, the lot of marriage shall have fallen, and he has had a good wife congenial to his heart, to him then for ever ill contends with good2 to be with him:
but whoso finds a baneful breed, lives with an incessant3 care to spirit and heart within his breast, and is an irremedi­ able woe.
Thus it is not possible to deceive or overreach4 the mind of Jove, for neither did Prometheus, guileless son of Iapetus, escape from beneath his severe wrath;
but a great chain, by necessity, constrains him, very knowing though he is.
But when first their sire5 became wroth in spirit against Briareus, Cottus, and Gyes, he bound them with a strong bond, admiring their overweening courage, and also their form and bulk;
and he made them dwell beneath the roomy earth:
then they in sooth in grief dwelling 'neath the earth,1 sate at the verge, on the extremities of vast Earth, very long, afflicted, having a great woe at heart;
but them the son of Cronus, and other immortal gods, whom fair-haired Rhea bare in the embrace of Cronus, by the counsels of Earth brought up again to light:
for she recounted to them at large everything, how that they should along with those (Titans) gain victory and splendid glory.
Long time then they fought, incurring soul-vexing toil, the Titan gods and as many as were born from Cronus, in opposition to each other in stout conflicts;
the one side,2 the glorious Titans from lofty Othrys, and the other, I wot, the gods, givers of good things, whom Rhea the fair-haired had borne to Cronus, in union with him, from Olympus.
They then, I ween, in soul-distressing battle, one party with the other, were fighting continuously more than ten years.
3
Nor was there any riddance or end of severe contention to either party, and the completion4 of the war was extended equally to either.
But when at length Jove set before them5 all things agreeable, to wit, nectar and ambrosia, on which the gods themselves feed, a noble spirit grew in the breasts of all.
And when they had tasted the nectar and delightful ambrosia, then at length the sire of gods and men addressed them:
“Hear me, illustrious children of Earth and Heaven, that I may speak what my spirit within my breast prompts me to speak.
For now a very long space6 are we fighting, each in opposition to other, concerning victory and power, all our days, the Titan gods and as many of us as are sprung from Cronus.
Now do ye show against the Titans in deadly fight both mighty force and hands in­ vincible, in gratitude for our mild loving-kindness, namely, after how many sufferings ye came back again to the light, from afflictive bondage, through our counsels,1 from the murky gloom."
Thus he spake ;
and him again the blameless Cottus addressed in answer:
“Excellent Lord, thou dost not tell things unlearnt by us:
but we too are aware that thy wisdom is excellent, and excellent thine intellect, and that thou hast been to the immortals an averter of terrible destruction.
2
And back again, from harsh bonds, have we come from the murky darkness, through thy thoughtful care, 0 royal son of Cronus, having experienced treatment unhoped-for.2
Wherefore also now with stedfast purpose and prudent counsel we will pro­ tect thy might in dread conflict, fighting with the Titans in stout battles."
Thus spake he:
and the gods, givers of good, applauded, when they had heard his speech:
and their spirit was eager for battle still more than before, and they stirred up unhappy3 strife all of them, female as well as male, on that day, both Titan gods, and as many as had sprung from Cro­ nus, and they whom Jove sent up to light from Erebus, be­ neath the earth, terrible and strong, having overweening force.
From the shoulders of these a hundred hands outsprung to all alike, and to each fifty heads grew from their shoulders over their sturdy limbs.
They then were pitted5 against the Titans in deadly combat, holding huge1 rocks in their sturdy hands.
But the Titans on the other side made strong their squadrons with alacrity, and both parties were showing work of hand and force at the same time, and the boundless sea re­ echoed terribly, and earth resounded loudly, and broad heaven groaned, being shaken, and vast Olympus was convulsed from its base under the violence of the immortals,2 and a severe quaking came to murky Tartarus,3 namely, a hollow sound of countless chase of feet, and of strong battle-strokes:
to such an extent, I ween, did they hurl groan-causing weapons.
And the voice of both parties reached to starry heaven, as they cheered:
for they came together with a great war-cry.
Nor longer, in truth, did Jove restrain his fury, but ther.
forthwith his heart was filled with fierceness, and he begar.
also to exhibit4 all his force:
then, I wot, from heaven ant.
from Olympus together he went forth lightening continually and the bolts close together with thunder and lightning flew1 duly from his sturdy hand, whirling a sacred flash, in fre­ quent1 succession, while all-around life-giving Earth was crashing in conflagration, and the immense forests on all sides crackled loudly with fire.
All land was boiling, and Oceanis streams, and the barren sea:
warm vapour was cir­ cling the earth-born Titans, and the incessant blaze reached the divine dense-atmosphere,2 whilst flashing radiance of thunderbolt and lightning was bereaving their eyes of sight, strong heroes though they were.
Fearful heat likewise pos­ sessed Chaos:
3 and it seemed, to look at, face to face, with the eye, and to hear the sound with the ear, just as if earth and broad heaven from above were threatening to meet:
(for such an exceeding crash would have arisen from earth falling in ruins, and heaven dashing it down from above.)
Such a din there rose when the gods clashed in strife.
The winds too at the same time were stirring up quaking and dust to­ gether, thunder and lightning and smoking bolt, shafts of the mighty Jove;
and they were bearing shout and battle-cry into the midst, one of another, then a terrible noise of dread­ ful strife was roused, strength of prowess was put forth, and the battle was inclined :
but before that time assailing one an­ other, they were fighting4 incessantly in stern conflict.
Now the others, I wot, among the first ranks roused the keen fight, Cottus, Briareus, and Gyes insatiable in war, who truly were hurling from sturdy hands three hundred rocks close upon each other, and they had overshadowed the Titans with mis­ siles, sent them 'neath the broad-wayed earth, and bound them in irksome bonds, (having conquered them with their hands, over-haughty though they were,) as far beneath under earth1 as heaven is from the earth, for equal is the space from earth to murky Tartarus.
For nine nights and days also would a brazen anvil be descending from the heaven, and come on the tenth to the earth:
and nine days as well as nights again would a brazen anvil be descending from the earth, to reach on the tenth to Tartarus.
2
Around it moreover a brazen fence3 has been forged:
and about it Night is poured in three rows around the neck;
but above spring the roots of Earth and barren Sea.
There, under murky darkness, the Titan gods lie hidden4 by the counsels of cloud-compelling Jupiter in a dark, drear place, where oreb the extremities of vast Earth.
These may not go forth, for Neptune has placed above them brazen gates, and a wall goes round them on both sides.
6
There dwell Gyes, and Cottus, and high-spirited Briareus, faithful guards of aegis-bearing Jove.
And there are the sources and boundaries of dusky Earth, of murky Tartarus, of barren Sea, and starry Heaven, all in their order:
boundaries op­ pressive and gloomy, which also even gods abhor, a vast chasm, 1 not even for a whole round of a year would one reach the pavement, after having first been within the gates:
but hurricane to hurricane would bear him onward2 hither and thither, distressing him, and dreadful even to immortal gods is this prodigy, and there the dread abodes of gloomy Night stand shrouded in dark clouds.
In front of these the son of Iapetus stands and holds 3 broad Heaven, with his head and unwearied hands, unmovedly, where Night and Day also drawing nigh are wont to salute each other,4 as they cross the vast brazen threshold.
The one is about to go down within, whilst the other comes forth abroad, nor ever doth the abode constrain both within ;
but constantly one at any rate being outside the dwelling, wanders over the earth, while the other again beingwithin the abode, awaits5 the season of her journey, until it come ;
the one having a far-seeing light for men-on- the-earth, and the other, destructive Night, having Sleep, the brother of Death, in its hands, being shrouded in hazy mist.
6
And there the sons of obscure Night hold their habitation, Sleep and Death, dread gods:
nor ever doth the bright sun look upon them with his rays,7 as he ascends the heaven, or descends from the heaven.
Of whom indeed the one tarries on the earth and the broad surface of the sea, silently and soothingly to men;
but of the other, iron is the heart, and brazen is his ruthless soul within his breast;
and whomsoever of men he may have first caught, he holdeth:
and he is hos­ tile even to immortal gods.
There in the front stand the re­ sounding mansions of the infernal god, of mighty Hades, and awful2 Persephone besides;
and a fierce dog keeps guard in front, a ruthless dog;
and he has an evil trick:
those who enter he fawns upon with his tail and both ears3 alike, yet he suffers them not to go forth back again, but lies in wait and devours whomsoever he may have caught going forth without the gates of strong Hades and dread Persephone.
There too dwells a goddess odious to immortals, dread Styx, eldest daughter of back-flowing" Ocean:
and apart from the gods she inhabits renowned dwellings vaulted by huge rocks;
and round about on all sides they are strengthened to Heaven by silver columns.
And seldom goes the fleet-footed daughter of Than mas, Iris, on a message5 over the broad back of the sea,6 namely, when haply strife and quarrel shall have arisen among the immortals:
and whosoever, I wot, of them that hold Olym­ pian dwellings, utters falsehood, then also Jove7 is wont to send Iris to bring from far in a golden ewer the great oath of the gods, the renowned water, cold as it is, which also runs down from a steep and lofty rock ;
but in abundance beneath the roomy Earth flows a branch of Ocean from the sacred river through black Night;
and a tenth portion has been assigned 1 to it.
In nine portions indeed, rolling around Earth and also the broad back of the Sea with silver whirlpools, he (Ocean) falls into the brine;
but the other one part flows forth from a rock, a great bane to the gods.
Whosoever of im­ mortals that occupy the top of snowy Olympus, shall have offered of this2 as a libation, and sworn over it a false oath, lies breathless until the completion of a year,3 nor ever comes near the repast of nectar and ambrosia, but also lies breath­ less and speechless on a strown couch, and a baneful stupor over-shrouds him.
But when he has fulfilled his malady until the full year, then another after another severer trouble suc­ ceeds for him.
And for nine years he is parted from the ever- living gods;
nor ever does he mix with them in council nor in feasts for nine whole years;
but in the tenth he mingles again in the assemblies4 of the gods immortal, who occupy Olympian dwellings.
Such a grave oath, I wot, have the gods made the imperishable water of Styx, that ancient Ma­ ter, which also runs through a very rugged tract.
There too are the sources and boundaries of dusky Earth, and murky Tartarus, and barren Sea, and starry Heaven, all in order;
boundaries oppressive and gloomy, which also even gods ab­ hor.
And there are gleaming5 gates and a brazen threshold, unshaken and fixed upon far-extending foundations, self- growing ;
and before it, outside of all the gods, beyond gloomy Chaos, the Titans dwell.
But the famed allies6 of loud- crashing Jove inhabit dwellings under the foundations of the Ocean, namely, Cottus and Gyes.
Briareus indeed, for his part, strong as he was, deep-sounding Earth-shaker made his son-in-law, and gave him to wife his daughter Cymopolia.
But when Jove had driven the Titans out from Heaven, huge Earth bare her youngest-born son, Typhoeus,1 by the embrace of Tartarus, through golden Aphrodite.
Whose hands, indeed, are apt for deeds on the score of strength, and untiring the feet of the strong god;
and from his shoulders there were a hundred heads of a serpent, a fierce dragon, play­ ing with dusky2 tongues, and from the eyes in his wondrous heads fire sparkled beneath the brows:
whilst from all his heads fire was gleaming, as he looked keenly.
In all his ter­ rible heads, too, were voices sending forth every kind of sound ineffable.
For one while indeed they would utter sounds, so as for the gods to understand,3 and at another time again the voice of a loud-bellowing bull, untameable in force, and proud in utterance ;
at another time, again, that of a lion possessing a daring spirit;
at another yet again they would sound like to whelps, wondrous to hear;
and at another he would hiss, and the lofty mountains resound.
And, in sooth, then would there have been done a deed past remedy, and he, even he, would have reigned over mortals and immortals, unless, I wot, the sire of gods and men had quickly observed him.
Harshly then he, thundered, and heavily, and terribly the earth re­ echoed around;
and the broad heaven above, and the sea, and streams of ocean, and the abysses of earth.
But beneath his immortal feet1 vast Olympus trembled, as the king uprose, and earth groaned beneath.
And the heat from both2 caught the dark-coloured sea, both of the thunder and lightning, and fire from the monster, the heat arising from the thunder-storms, winds, and burning lightning.
And all earth and heaven and sea were boiling;
and huge billows roared around the shores about and around, beneath the violence of gods;
and unal- layed quaking arose.
Pluto trembled, monarch over the dead beneath ;
and the Titans under Tartarus, standing about Cro­ nus,3 trembled also, on account of the unceasing tumult and dreadful contention.
But Jove, when in truth he had raised high4 his wrath, and had taken his arms, his thunder and lightning, and smoking bolt, leapt up, and smote him from Olympus, and scorched5 all-around all the wondrous heads of the terrible monster.
But when at length he had quelled it, after having smitten it with blows, the monster fell down lamed, and huge Earth groaned.
But the flame from the lightning-blasted monster6 flashed forth in the mountain-hollows, hidden and rugged, when he was stricken, and much was the vast earth burnt and melted by the boundless vapour, like as pewter,7 heated by the art of youths, and by the well-bored melting-pit;
or iron, which is the hardest of metals, subdued in the dells of the mountain by blazing fire, melts in the sacred earth beneath the hands of Vulcan.
So, I wot, was earth melted in the glare of burning fire.
Then, troubled in spirit, he hurled him into wide Tartarus.
Now from Typhoeus1 is the strength of winds moist-blow­ ing, except the south-west, the north, and Argestes, and Ze­ phyr, who also indeed are a race from the gods, a great bless­ ing to mortals.
But the others, being random gusts, breathe over the sea.
And these in truth falling upon the darksome deep, rage with baneful hurricane, a great hurt to mortals;
and now here, now there they blow, and scatter barks, and destroy sailors:
nor is there any succour from ill to men, who encounter them on the ocean.
But these again even o'er the boundless flowery earth spoil the pleasant works of earth- born men, filling them with dust and wearisome uproar.
But when, I wot, the blessed gods had fulfilled their labour, and contended with the Titans perforce on the score of hon­ ours,2 then it was, I say, that they urged far-seeing Jove, by the advice of Earth, to rule and reign over immortals:
and he duly distributed honours amongst them.
And Jupiter, king of the gods, made Metis first his wife;
Metis, most wise of deities as well as mortal men.
But when now at length she was about to give birth to Minerva, gleam- ing-eyed goddess, then it was that having by deceit beguiled her mind with flattering words, he placed her within his own belly by the advice of Earth, and of starry Heaven.
1
For thus they persuaded him, lest other of everliving gods should possess2 sovereign honour in the room of Jove.
For of her it was fated that wise children should be born:
first the glancing-eyed Tritonian maiden, having equal might and prudent counsel with her sire;
and then, I ween, she was going to give-birth-to a son, as king of gods and men, with an overbearing spirit, but that in sooth Jove deposited her first in his own belly, that the goddess might indicate to him both good and bad.
3
Next he wedded bright Themis,4 who bare the Hours, Eunomia, Dice, and blooming Peace, who care for their works for mortal men ;
and the Parcæ,5 to whom counselling Jove gave most honour, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, who also give to men good and evil to possess.
And Eurynome,6 daughter of Ocean, having a very lovely form, bare him the fair-cheeked Graces, Aglaia, and Euphrosyne, and winsome Thalia;
from whose eyelids also as they gazed dropped Love, unnerving limbs, and sweetly too look they under their brows.
But he came to the couch of much- nourishing Demeter, who bare him white-armed Proserpine ;
er whom Pluto ravished from her mother:
and sage Jupiter gave her.
1
And next he was enamoured of beautiful-haired Mnemosyne, of whom were born to him the Muses nine,* with-golden-fillets, to whom festivals, and the delight of song, are wont to be a pleasure.
But Apollo and Artemis, rejoicing-in-arrows, a lovely off­ spring beyond all the heavenly-beings, Latona3 in sooth brought forth, after union in love with aegis-bearing Jove.
And last made he blooming Juno his spouse.
She bare Hebe, and Mars, and Lucina, having been united in love with the king of gods and men.
But by himself, from his head, he produced glancing-eyed Tritonis,4 fierce, strife-stirring, army- leading, unsubdued, and awful, to whom dins, and wars, and battles are a delight.
And Juno,5 without having been united in love, brought forth famous Vulcan, and put out all her strength, and strove with her husband;
Vulcan, distinguished in arts from amongst all the heaven-born.
But from Amphitrite and the loud-roaring Earth-shaker sprang great and widely-powerful Triton, who occupies the depth of the sea, and inhabits golden houses1 beside his dear mother and his royal sire, being a terrible god.
To shield- piercing Mars, however, Cytherea bare Fear and Terror, formidable deities, even they who route dense phalanxes of men in horrid war, with the help of city-spoiler Mars;
2 and Harmonia, whom high-spirited Cadmus made his spouse.
Then to Jove, I wot, Maia,3 daughter of Atlas, bare glori­ ous Hermes, herald of immortals, having ascended his holy couch.
And to him, in sooth, Semele,4 daughter of Cadmus, bare an illustrious son, even jocund Bacchus, after union in love, mortal though sce was, an immortal.
But now both are deities.
And Alcmena, after union in love with cloud-com­ pelling Jove, bare Hercules the strong.
But Vulcan, far-famed, crippled god, took to wife blooming Aglaia, youngest of the Graces.
And Bacchus, of golden hair, took for his blooming bride auburn-tressed Ariadne, daughter of Minos.
And her the son of Cronus made im­ mortal, 5 and unsusceptible of old age for him.
And fair- ankled Alcmena's valiant son, mighty Hercules, having Be- complished grievous toils, made Hebe, daughter of mighty Jove and Juno-with-golden-sandals, his bashful wife in snowy Olympus:
6 happy hero, who having achieved a great work, dwells among the immortals uninjured and ageless eveimore.
To the unwearied Sun the famous Oceanid, Perseis,l bare Circe and king CEetes.
And CEetes, son of man-enlightening Sun, wedded beauteous-cheeked Idyia, daughter of Ocean, perfect river, by the will of the gods.
But she then, subdued in love through golden Aphrodite, brought forth to him fair-ankled Medea.
Now fare ye well, gods dwelling in Olympian mansions ;
2 [Islands and Continents, and briny Sea within ;
] and now Olympian Muses, sweet of speech, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, sing ye the tribe of goddesses, as many as in truth having been united, though immortal, with mortal men, gave birth to children resembling gods.
Ceres, divine among goddesses, after union in delightsome love, bare Plutus to the hero lasius,3 in a thrice-ploughed fal­ low, in the fertile country of Crete, a kind god, who goes over all the earth, and the broad surface of the sea;
and to him that has chanced upon him, and into whose hands he may have come, him, I say, he is wont to make rich, and presents to him much wealth.
And to Cadmus, Harmonia,5 daughter of golden Aphrodite, bare Ino, Semele, and fair-cheeked Agave, and Autonoe, whom Aristæus of-clustering-locks wedded, and Polydorus in tower-circled Thebes.
But Callirhoe, daughter of Ocean, united to brave-hearted Chrysaor in union of all-golden Aphrodite,1 bare a son the strongest of all mortals, Geryon, whom mighty Hercules slew, for the sake of the trailing-footed oxen2 in island Erythea.
And to Tithonus Aurora3 bare Memnon with-brazen-helm, king of the Æthiopians, and the sovereign Hemathion.
But to Cephalus in truth she produced an illustrious son, the brave Phaethon,4 a man like to the gods, whom, I wot, when young, in the tender flower of glorious youth, a lad, conscious but of young fancies, laughter-loving Aphrodite snatched up, and rushed away, and she made him, in her sacred fanes, her nightly temple-keeper, a divine Genius.
And the daughter of (Œtes, Jove-descended king, Jason, 5 son of .:
son, by the counsels of ever-living gods, carried off from (Œtes, after he had fulfilled the grievous toils, which, being many in number, the great and overbearing king, insolent and infatuated Pelias, doer of deeds of violence, imposed upon him.
Which having achieved, after having toiled much, the son of Æson arrived at Iolchos, bearing in his fleet ship a dark-eyed maiden, and her he made his blooming bride.
Yes, and she, having been yoked with Jason, shepherd of his people, bore a son Medeus, whom Chiron, son of Philyra, reared on the mountains;
whilst the purpose of mighty Jove was being fulfilled.
But of the daughters of Nereus, ancient sea-god, Psamathe in truth, di­ vine among goddesses, bare Phocus 1 in the embrace of Æacus, through golden Aphrodite :
and the goddess Thetis, of the sil­ ver feet, yielding to Peleus, gave birth to Achilles the lion- hearted, who-broke-the-ranks-of-men.
Fair-wreathed Cytherea2 too, I wot, blending in delight­ some love with the hero Anchises, bare Æneas on the peaks of many-valleyed, woody Ida.
But Ciroe, daughter of the Sun, born-of-Hyperion, by the love of Ulysses3 of-enduring- heart, gave birth to Agrius and blameless and strong Latinus ;
Telegonus also she bare through golden Aphrodite.
Now these in truth very far in a recess of sacred isles,4 reigned over all the very far-renowned Tyrrhenians.
But Calypso, divine among goddesses, bore to Ulysses Nausithoüs and Nausinous after union in delightful love.
These, though immortal, hav­ ing been united with mortal men, gave birth to children like unto the gods.
And now sing ye the tribe of women, ye sweet-spoken Olympian Muses, daughters of ægis-bearing Jove.OR as Alcmena,1 daughter of Electryon,2 exciter of peo­ ples, left her home and father-land, and came to Thebes in the train of martial Amphitryon.
She, I wot, excelled the race of gentler women3 in beauty and height;
yea, and in mind indeed none did compete with her of those, whom mor­ tal women bare by union with mortal men.
Both from her head4 and from her dark eyelids breathed even such a fra­ grance as from those of golden Aphrodite.
Yet she e'en so was wont to revere at heart her spouse, as never any of gentler women 1 revered:
though in very truth lie had by force subdued and slain her noble father, in wrath about oxen:
he then having left his father-land, came to Thebes, and suppli­ cated2 the shield-bearing Cadmeans.
There dwelt he with his chaste spouse, apart, and without delightsome union, nor might he ascend the couch of fair-ankled Alcmena, before3 that he bad avenged the slaughter of the high-souled brothers of his wife, and consumed with wasting fire the villages of warlike heroes, the Taphians4 and Teleboans.
For so was it ordered him, and the gods were witnesses to it;
whose wrath he dreaded, and hastened with all speed to accomplish a great work, which was Jove's law to him.
With him then, eager for war and battle-din, the horse-spurring Bœotians, breathing over their shields,5 the close-fighting Locrians, and the high-hearted Phocians, followed, and the gallant son of Alcaeus headed them, glorying in his hosts.
But the sire of men and gods was weaving in his mind another counsel, that to gods and inventive6 men he might beget an averter of de­ struction.
So he arose from Olympus, building deceit in the deep of his heart, during-the-night, in eagerness for the em­ brace of the fair-zoned dame;
and soon he arrived at the Typhaonian height :
7 and thence counsellor Jove drew nigh to topmost Phicium.
There sitting be revolved divine works in his mind;
for the self-same night he was united in couch and love with the tapering-ankled daughter of Electryon, and he satisfied, I ween, his longing.
On the same night too, Amphitryon, rouser of peoples, a splendid hero, returned to his home, after having achieved a great deed.
Nor did he hasten to go to his servants, and shepherd hinds,1 that is, be­ fore he had ascended the couch of his spouse:
for such eager­ ness possessed the shepherd of his peoples at heart.
And as when a man is glad2 to have escaped ill arising out of a severe disease, or even out of hard bonds, so then, I wot, Amphitryon, having brought to an end his difficult task, delightedly and gladly came to his own home.
All-night-long3 then he slept beside his modest spouse, delighting himself in the gifts of golden Aphrodite.
So then she, embraced by a god and by a man far the best of men, in seven-gated Thebes bare twin sons, agreeing in nought beyond, brothers though indeed4 they were:
the one inferior, the other again a far better man, both valiant and strong, the mighty Hercules, whom she bare after having been embraced by the cloud-darkener, son of Cronus:
but Iphiclus by Amphitryon, shaker of spears ;
an offspring distinct :
5 the one after union with mortal man, the other with Jupiter, son of Cronus, sovereign of all the gods.
Who also slew Cycnus, 6 great-hearted son of Mars :
for in the grove of the far-darting Apollo, he found him and his sire Mars, insatiate of war, gleaming in arms, as the brightness of burning fire, upstanding in their chariot:
the swift steeds struck the earth, dinting it with their hoofs, and the dust burnt around them, shaken violently beneath wicker1 cars and hoofs of horses.
But well-made chariots and seat-rims kept rattling, as the steeds sped on:
blameless Cycnus rejoiced, in hope that he should slay with the sword Jove's warlike son, and the charioteer, and strip him of his glorious mail.
Yet Phœbus Apollo did not hear his prayers, for he had himself urged the mighty Hercules against him.
Then all the grove and altar of Pagasæan 2 Apollo was flash­ ing with the arms of the fearful god, and with himself:
and from his eyes fire as it were blazed.
Who, being mortal, would have had the courage to rush against him, save Her­ cules and famous lolaus ?
for both great strength was theirs, and their unvanquished hands grew3 from their shoulders on stout limbs.
Who then, I ween, bespake his charioteer, brave Iolaus:
" 0 hero Iolaus,4 far dearest of all mortals, surely some grave sin did Amphitryon sin5 against the blessed immortals, who occupy Olympus, when he left Tiryns,6 well-built city, and came to strongly-fortified Thebes, after having slain Elec­ tryon on the score of the broad-browed herds;
and came to Creon, and long-robed Henioche,7 who, I wot, welcomed him, and provided him all things needful,l as 'twas, right they should to suppliants;
and they honoured him the more from the heart.
So he lived exulting with the beauteous-ankled daughter of Electryon, his spouse:
and full soon when the year came round, we were born, thy sire and I, alike neither in stature nor in thoughts.
His senses Jove took from him, who left his own hornet and his own parents, and went forth, for the purpose of honouring the erring3 Eurystheus, wretched man that he was;
no doubt ofttimes afterward he bewailed over his infatuation, in grief;
but it is not to be recalled.
On me, however, fate enjoined severe labours.
But, my friend, quickly grasp thou now the purple reins of the fleet-footed steeds, and rousing great courage within thy heart, drive4 straight for­ ward the swift chariot, and thy strong fleet-footed steeds;
fearing not a whit the din of mortal-slaying Mars, who now is crying out and raging around the sacred grove of Phœbus Apollo, far-darting king:
in very truth, mighty though he be, he shall have 5 his fill of war.
"And him in turn blameless Iolaus addressed.
" Honoured6 lord, in very truth then the sire of gods and men honours thy head, and so does bull-voiced7 Neptune, who keeps the bat- tlement of Thebes, and protects the city;
just as now they bring this man also strong and mighty into thy hands, that thou mayest carry off excellent glory.
But come !
put on thy warlike arms, that, with all speed, having brought our chariots near, that of Mars, and our own, we may engage, since he will not in truth terrify the undaunted son of Jove, nor the child of Iphiclus, but methinks he will flee from the two de­ scendants 1 of the faultless son of Alcæus, who now are nigh to him,2 desiring to engage in the tumult of battle, matters which to them are far more dear than a feast.
"Thus spake he:
then smiled the mighty Hercules, exulting 3 in his heart, for he had spoken words very congenial to him, and in answer to him he addressed winged words:
" 0 hero Iolaus, Jove-sprung, no more afar is the rough conflict:
as then of yore thou wast warlike, so now too guide4 every way the huge steed, dark-maned Arion,5 and aid me as thou mayest be able."
So having spoken, he placed about his legs greaves of bright mountain-brass, 6 splendid presents of Vulcan:
next donned he a corselet about his breast, beau­ tiful, and of gold, curiously wrought, which Jove's daughter Pallas Minerva had given him, when for the first time he was about to rush furiously upon groanful conflicts.
Then fastened the mighty man around his shoulders a sword, the averter of destruction:
and the hollow quiver athwart his breast he cast over his back:
within it were many chilly arrows, givers of death that-striketh-dumb.
At the points indeed they were- fraught with death and were wet with tears, 1 in the middle polished, and very long:
but at the back end covered with the feathers of a dusky eaglet
Then took he his stout spear, pointed with gleaming brass, and on his strong brows placed his well-wrought, curious helmet of adamant, fitted on his temples, which fenced the head of divine Hercules.
Yea, and in his hand he took an all-variegated shield, nei­ ther could any one have broken it by flinging a javelin, nor have shattered it, a marvel to behold.
For the whole of it was bright all-around with chalk, and white ivory, and elec­ tron, and gleaming with shining gold;
and plates of blue- cast-steel had been drawn across it.
On its centre was the unspeakable terror of a dragon glancing backwards with eyes gleaming with fire:
his mouth too was filled with teeth run­ ning in a white line,5 dread and unapproachable, and above his terrible forehead, dread Strife was hovering, as she raises the battle-rout:
hard-hearted Strife, who, I wot, was taking mind and heart from mortals, whosoever chanced to wage war against the son of Jove.
Of these 6 also their souls go be-
Death the earth, within the shades, but their bones, when the skin has rotted around them, under the parching Dog-star, 1 moulder in the dark earth.
On it had been wrought Driving- forward, and Beating-back, and on it raged Tumult, Fear, and Carnage.
Strife too, and Panic, were darting-to-and-fro on it, and2 on it deathly Fate, holding one mortal lately-wounded, another unwounded, and another dead, was dragging them by the feet through the battle-fray.
And about her shoulders had she a vestment gory with blood of men, while she looked terribly, and bellowed with the gnashing of teeth.
On it like­ wise were heads of terrible serpents, unspeakable, twelve in number, which were wont to scare the races of men upon earth, whosoever chanced to wage war against the son of Jove.
From the teeth of which serpents too there was a gnashing, whensoever the descendant of Amphitryon might be fighting.
These wondrous works 3 then blazed on the shield.
And there appeared4 to the sight as it were spots on the terrible dragons:
azure were they on their backs, and they had been blackened as to their jaws.
And on it were herds of snouted5 boars and of lions, eyeing one another, and chafing, and ready to spring.
Of which also the ranks were advancing in troops, nor in truth did they, either of them, tremble, nay both par­ ties verily were bristling in back.
For already before them was lying a huge lion, and around him two boars deprived6 of their life, and their dark blood was dropping down to the ground;
while they, letting their necks fall on the ground, lay dead beneath the terrible lions.
But they were still the more roused, in rage for fighting, both snouted boars and grim lions.
And on it was wrought the battle of the warrior Lapithæ 1 around Cæneus the king and Dryas, and Pirithous, Hopleus, Exadius, Phalerus, and Prolochus, Mopsus, 2 son of Ampyx of Titaressa, a branch of Mars, and Theseus, son of Ægeus, like unto the immortals:
these were of silver, having golden arms about their bodies.
And the Centaurs3 on the opposite side were gathered together against them, around huge Petræus and Asbolus, diviner-by-birds, Arctus, Urius, dark-haired Mimas, and the two sons of Peucus, Perimedes and Dryalus, in silver likewise, and having in their hands golden pine-trees.
Aye and pressing violently 4 together, even as if they were alive, they were fighting hand to hand with outstretched spears and pines.
On it too stood in gold the fleet-footed steeds of terrible Mars:
and on it likewise destructive Mars himself, the wearer of spoils,5 with lance in hand, cheering his foot­ men,6 empurpled in blood, as if spoiling the living, and stand- ing in his chariot:
and beside him stood Terror and Fear,1 eager to enter the war of men.
On it too was wrought Jove'a daughter, the Trito-born, driver of spoil, like to her, and as it were wishing to array the battle, having a spear in hand, and a golden helmet,2 and an ægis about her shoulders, and she was approaching the dreadful battle.
And on it was a holy choir of immortals;
and in the midst, I ween, the son of Jove and Latona was playing a delightsome strain on golden lyre:
and holy Olympus,3 seat of the gods:
and on it an assembly, but boundless wealth 4 had been wrought encircling it, in a contest of the gods:
whilst the goddesses, the Pierian Muses, were beginning the song, like unto clear songstresses.
Upon it a harbour too, with safe port, of the monstrous sea, had been fashioned circular-wise of refined tin, like to a surging sea:
howbeit many dolphins in the midst of it were dashing here and there in-chase-of-fish, just as though they were swimming:
and two dolphins5 of silver, breathing hardly, were feasting-on the dumb fishes.
6
Beneath these were quivering fishes wrought-in-brass:
but on the banks sat a fisherman7 on-the-look-out:
and he had in his hands a net for fish, resembling as he did one in act to throw.
On it too was fair-haired Danae's son, equestrian Perseus:
neither, I wot, touching the shield with his feet,1 nor yet far from it, a great marvel to tell of:
for he rested nowhere.
For so had the famous crippled-god wrought him with his hands in gold, but about his feet he had winged sandals.
And around his shoulders a hanger of brass with-iron-scab­ bard lay hanging from a thong:
but he was flitting about quick as thought.
2
The whole of his back the head of the Gorgon, terrible monster,3 was covering, and round about it, wrought-in-silver, a knapsack4 was stretching, a marvel to behold, and bright tassels were hanging down wrought-in- gold, and the dreadful helmet of Hades 5 was set around the temples of the king, having a fearful gloom of night.
But like unto one hurrying and shuddering with fear, Perseus, son of Danae, himself was outstretched :
whilst after him the Gorgons, unapproachable and unspeakable, were darting, ea­ ger to seize him:
but as they moved upon the pale adamant,6 the shield seemed clanking with a vast din sharply and shrilly, and on their girdles7 two dragons were hanging, curving their heads.
These two, I wot, were forking their tongues, and, looking savagely, were gnashing their teeth in wrath.
But over the dread Gorgon heads great terror was shaking:
and the men above them were fighting in warlike arms, one party warding off a pest on behalf of their city and their parents, and the other eager to devastate.
Many were lying low;
yet more still were fighting engaged in the conflict:
and the women on the well-built towers were shrieking with a brazen shrill­ ness,2 and were tearing their cheeks, like to living women, works of famous Vulcan.
But men, who were elders, and whom age had overtaken,3 were in crowds without the gates, and were uplifting their hands to the blessed gods, in fear concerning their children :
-these again were engaging in combat, and in their wake the dark Fates,4 gnashing white teeth, of aspect-fierce and terrible, bloody and unapproach­ able, were holding strife for those who fell.
But all, I wot, were eager to quaff dark blood:
and whom­ soever they had happened to find first lying-low or falling fresh-wounded, about him indeed one of them 5 was casting huge talons, and a soul was descending to Hades, into chill Tartarus.
So when they had satisfied their fancy with hu­ man blood, behind them they would cast the corpse, and, go­ ing back again, hurry to the tumult and fray.
Clotho and Lachesis stood beside them:
the somewhat lesser goddess Atropos' was by no means a tall goddess;
but, I ween, she yet was excellent above them all and eldest of them.
All of them 2 then had engaged in a sharp conflict about one man, and fiercely looked they one at the other, wrathful in their glances, and on the body they made their nails and hands alike.
Beside them too stood Gloomy Bad and dread, pale, squalid, cowering through famine, swollen-of-knee:
4 but long nails were upon the tips of her hands.
From her nostrils indeed were flowing mucous discharges, and from her cheeks blood was dripping on the ground:
but she stood grinning intolerably,5 and much dust lay upon her shoulders;
6 and moistened was sAe with tears.
But hard-by was a city of men with-noble-towers :
and seven golden gates fitted in their lintels enclosed it:
whilst its men were taking delight in fes­ tivities and dances:
for some upon a well-wheeled car were leading home a bride to her husband,7 and the marriage-song was bursting forth unbounded;
whilst afar a brilliant gleam from blazing torches was whirling about in the hands of at­ tendant maidens.
Now these, blooming in beauty, were going in advance, and sportive bands-of-dancers followed them.
These from their soft voices8 were breathing a song to the sound of shrill pipes, and echo around them spread in broken utterance:
whilst those to the lyre 1 w ere leading the delight­ some dance.
Then again on another side young men were making merry to the sound of the flute :
these indeed disporting with dance and song, those on the other hand laughing.
But to the flute-player they were proceeding, each of them:
and festivals, choirs, and rejoicings were occupying all the city.
Others again in front of the city had mounted on horseback and were darting along.
And ploughers were cleaving the rich earth, and had their tunics girt neatly.
2
But there was a thick standing-crop.
Some on their part indeed were reap­ ing with sharp sickles the staff-like stalks laden with ears, as it were the present of Ceres.3
Others, I wot, were binding them in straw-ropes, and were laying the threshing-floor;
4 whilst others with vine-sickles in their hands were gathering- the-fruit of the vines ;
others again were carrying to baskets from the vintagers clusters white and dark from tall rows, laden with foliage and silvery tendrils ;
and others again were carrying them in baskets:
near them was a row-of-vines wrought-in-gold, famous works of very-skilful Vulcan,5 wav­ ing with leaves and trellises6 in-silver, [these again indeed sporting each to the minstrel's flute,] weighed down with grapes:
yes, and these indeed had been represented dark.
Some were treading 1 the grapes and others were drawing the juice;
whilst others were contending with the fist, and in wrestling :
2 others were chasing fleet-footed hares, sportsmen, and a brace of sharp-toothed hounds in front, eager to catch the hares, and they eager to escape them:
and beside them horsemen 3 were busy, and for prizes they were engaging in strife and toil:
charioteers standing on well-compacted chari­ ots were letting-loose swift steeds, giving them the reins;
and the close-joined chariots were flying rattling over the ground, and the naves of the wheels added to the din.
They then, I wot, were busied in endless toil, nor had victory ever been achieved for them, but they were engaged in a yet-doubt­ ful contest.
Now to them also was proposed a huge tripod, within the course,4 wrought-of-gold, the famous work of skil­ ful Vulcan.
Around the rim was flowing Ocean, like as it were swelling;
and it was encircling all the curiously-wrought shield.
About it the high-hovering swans were clamouring loud, many of which, I wot, were swimming on the water's surface, while near them fishes were tumbling.
A marvel to look-upon,6 even to loud-thundering Jove, through whose , counsels Vulcan made the vast and sturdy shield, and framed 1 it with his hands.
This was the valiant son of Jove shaking with violence, and vaulting upon his horse-chariot, like unto the lightning-flash 2 of his sire, aegis-bearing Jove, as he lightly took his stand:
but for him his brave chariot­ eer, lolaus, mounting the chariot-board, was guiding the crooked car.
And nigh them came Minerva, glancing-eyed goddess, and in encouragement addressed them in winged words.“
Save you, offspring of Lynceus far-renowned:
now of a truth Jove, ruling among the blest, giveth you might to slay Cycnus, and spoil him of his famous arms.
But I will tell you 4 one other word, 0 far chiefest among the hosts.
Whensoever, I say, you shall have 'reft Cycnus of dear life, there leave him 5 then, and his arms:
but do you by yourself watch Mars, the slayer of mortals, as he approaches, where you shall have seen him with your eyes, unprotected by the curiously-wrought shield, and there wound him with sharp blade, and then retire:
for look you now, it is not fated for you to capture either his steed or his famous arms.
"So spake she, divine among goddesses, and mounted the car6 in haste, bearing in her immortal hands victory and glory.
'Twas then, I wot, Iolaus, Jove-descended, terribly urged on his steeds:
and they by reason of his shouting were bearing hurriedly along the swift chariot, raising-a-dust 1 through the plain;
for the gleaming-eyed goddess Minerva had inspired them with spirit, by having brandished the ægis;
and the earth was groaning around.
They then were advancing together, like unto fire2 or a storm, Cycnus, tamer-of-steeds, and Mars, insatiate in the battle-cry.
Whose steeds indeed then on facing one an­ other, neighed shrilly :
3 and Echo rang brokenly around.
The mighty Hercules addressed him (Cycnus) first.“
0 soft-hearted Cycnus, why now direct ye your swift steeds against us two, men who are experienced in toil and trouble:
nay, drive your well-polished chariot outside, and yield to go4 outside of the path.
Now look you I pass to Trachis, to the court of King Ceyx ;
5 for in power and reverence he hath pre-eminence at Trachis—and you yourself also know it right well, for you are spouse of his dark-eyed daughter Themistonoe.
0 craven, not assuredly will Mars ward off from you the end of death, that is, if we two shall meet in fight.
Already, methinks, even elsewhere, he has made some trial of my lance, when in behalf of sandy Pylos he stood opposed to me, madly desirous for the fight.
Thrice indeed stricken by my spear, he supported himself on the earth, his shield having been pierced,6 the fourth time, pressing with all my might, I smote his thigh, and broke-through his huge shield.
Then truly had he become dishonoured among im­ mortals, if he had left 1 under my hands his gory trophies.
"Thus spake he.
Nor, I ween, was Cycnus, skilled in the spear, minded to restrain his chariot-drawing steeds, in obedi­ ence to the other.
Then truly quickly leapt from their well- compacted chariots to the earth both the son of mighty Jove and the son of King Mars.
But the charioteers drove near2 their steeds with-flowing-manes:
and beneath them, as they rushed on, the broad earth was resounding with feet.
Even as when rocks from the lofty top of a high mountain leap- with-a-bound, and fall one upon another:
and many oaks of lofty foliage, many pines, and poplars with wide-stretching- roots, are crashed3 by them, as they roll down quickly, till they have reached the plain ;
thus fell they one upon another, loudly shouting.
Then all the city of the Myrmidons,4 and renowned Iolchus, and Arne, and Helice, and grassy Anthea, echoed loudly with the voice of both.
They met together with a wondrous battle-cry;
and loudly thundered Jove the counsellor, and down from heaven, I ween, he hurled drops of bloody making that a signal of war to his greatly-daring son.
Like as in the glades of a mountain a boar with-jutting- tusks and fierce to look upon, in his spirit ponders upon fight­ ing with hunting men, ay and twisting himself side-ways whets his white tusk, but foam drops about his jaws as he gnashes1 his teeth, and his eyes are like shining fire ;
2 and he bristles with mane erect on his crest and about his neck;
like such a beast the son of Jove leapt from his horse-chariot.
But when the dusky-winged songster cicala,3 perching on a verdant bough begins to sing of summer for man, the cicala whose meat and drink is the life-giving dew, 4 and both all-day-long, and in-the- morning pours he forth his voice in the fiercest heat, 5 when Si­ rius parches the skin, [then truly the beards spring around the millet, which men sow in summer, when unripe grapes begin to colour, gifts which Bacchus has given to men as matter of joy and grief,] at that season they began to fight, and a great tumult uprose.
LAnd as two lions, for a slain buck, in wrath have rushed one on the other, and fierce roaring and gnashing of teeth at the same time arises between them:
] but they, like vultures with curved-talons and hooked-beaks, screaming loudly, fight on a lofty rock for a mountain-roving goat, or a wild stag, a fat one, which a youth has stricken and slain with a shaft from his bow-string, but himself has wandered else- where, being ignorant of the spot;
whilst they quickly spy it, and hastily engage in a sharp fight about it;
so these heroes rushed, shouting, one on another.
Hereupon of a truth Cycnus, eager to slay the son of al­ mighty Jove, drove his brazen lance against his buckler, but broke not through the metal;
for the gifts of a god pro­ tected 1 him.
But Amphitryon's son, strong Hercules, struck violently with his long spear the neck exposed quickly under­ neath the chin between the helm and shield:
and the murder­ ous ashen-beam cleft away the two nerves ;
2 for the vast strength of the hero had fallen on him.
Then fell he, as when some oak has fallen,3 or some impassable rock, stricken with the smoking lightning of Jove.
So he fell, and around him his curiously-wrought brazen armour rattled.
Him then Jove's enduring-hearted son let alone, and he himself watching the approach of Mars, a pest-to-mortals, and looking fiercely with his eyes, like a lion, having chanced on a beast, which very eagerly tears the skin with strong claws, and with all speed deprives it of sweet life, while with fury, I wot, his dark heart is filled:
and glaring 5 fearfully with his eyes, and lash­ ing sides and shoulders with his tail, he tears the earth with his feet, nor does any one dare, having seen him face to face, approach or contend with him:
such, I ween, stood the son of Amphitryon, insatiate in the battle-cry, in array against Mars, gathering courage in his soul, promptly:
but he drew near him grieving in heart, then rushed both, one on the other, with shouting.
Yea, as when from a tall jutting-rock a crag has tumbled, and rolls with far boundings, it comes then on impetuously, but a tall hill has stood-in-its-way ;
1 where, in truth, it dashes against it.
there the hill detains it:
with just as great a shouting the one namely, chariot-pressing2 destruc­ tive Mars, rushed on with an outcry, but the other quick re­ ceived him.
But Minerva, child of aegis-bearing Jove, stood in the way of Mars with the dark ægis, and scowling at him terribly, addressed to him winged words.“
Hold, Mars, thy strong spirit, and unconquered hands.
For it is not lawful for thee to slay and strip Jove's bold- hearted son, Hercules, of his famous armour.
Nay come.
cease from the battle, and oppose not me.
"So spake she:
yet did she not prevail upon the high-hearted spirit of Mars:
but with a great shout, brandishing weapons like unto flame, he quickly rushed on mighty Hercules, in eagerness to slay him :
3 and, in truth, from wrath on account of his dead son, hurled his brazen spear violently against the broad shield.
Then glancing-eyed Minerva, stretching her­ self from the chariot, turned off the force of his spear.
Keen grief seized Mars:
and having drawn his sharp hanger, he sprang upon stout-hearted Hercules, but the son of Amphi­ tryon, insatiate in terrible war, violently wounded him in his onslaught, when he had exposed his thigh under the curiously wrought shield, and smote strongly through his flesh, having made a thrust with his spear:
so he prostrated him to the ground in the midst.
Then Terror and Fear 1 drave quickly nigh to him his well-wheeled chariot and steeds, and from the spacious earth placed him in his variously-wrought car:
and quickly then they lashed the steeds, and came to vast Olympus.
But Alcmena's son and glorious Iolaus, after spoiling Cyc­ nus of the beautiful arms from his shoulders, returned home:
and speedily then came they with fleet-footed steeds to the city of Trachis.
Glancing-eyed Minerva, however, arrived at vast Olympus, and the halls of her sire.
But Cycnus, on the other hand, Ceyx buried, and a countless people,2 who, near the city of the illustrious king, were dwelling in Anthe, and the city of the Myrmidons, and famed Iaolchos, and Arne, and Helice.3
And a vast host collected, in honour of Ceyx, dear to the blessed gods.
His tomb, however, and monument, the Anaurus4 swept from sight, swelling with wintry rains.
For so Apollo, son of Latona, bade it, because, I ween, he was wont to lie in wait, and spoil whoever happened to lead hecatombs to Delphi.
This poem of Hesiod is a Didactic poem, having for its main ob­ ject the inculcation of agricultural precepts and the management of domestic matters connected with the farmer's vocation.
The latter portion of the work, ήμέϱαι, is a sort of Calendar, while the former, .ἓργα, (by which name alone the whole is sometimes called,) details the whole process of husbandry and country labours.
There are two or three episodes, e. g. the story of Pan­ dora, the ages of the world, and the description of winter, (504— 558,) all of which some have thought the work of later poets.
Virgil has borrowed much of the ground-work of his Georgics from this poem, which, after his manner, he has admirably worked up, and polished with rare skill.
YE Muses1 from Pieria, celebrating in songs, come speak of Jove, and chaunt your2 sire, through whom mortal men are alike famed and fameless, named and nameless, by the will of mighty Jove.
For with ease indeed he maketh strong,3 and with ease bringeth low the strong:
and easily he minish- eth the illustrious, and increaseth the obscure:
easily too doth high-thundering Jove, who dwelleth in mansions highest, straighten the crooked, and blast the proud of heart.
Hear and behold and heed, and direct the judgments righteously, 0 thou !1 Now would I narrate what is true, 0 Perses.
Not, I ween, was there one kind only of Contention,2 but there are two upon the earth:
the one a sensible man would commend, but the other is blameworthy:
and they have spirits minded different ways.
3
For the one fosters evil war and discord, cruel as sIte is:
her at any rate no mortal loves, but of necessity, by the counsels of the immortals, they honour harsh Strife.
The other, however, gloomy Night bare first,4 and her, by far the best, the high-throned son of Cronos, dwell­ ing in the heavens, placed at earth's roots and among men:
'tis sAe also who still rouses a man to work, even though he be inactive.
For any one when idle having looked upon an­ other being rich, he,5 I say, makes haste to plough and to plant, and well to order his house;
for neighbour rivals neigh­ bour, when hastening toward riches;
but this contention is good for mortals.
1 Both potter is jealous of potter, and craftsman of craftsman ;
and poor man has a grudge against poor man, and poet against poet.
But do thou, Perses,2 lay up these things in thy mind, nor let Contention rejoicing-in-ills hinder thy mind from work, whilst it gapes at strifes, and is a listener in the forum.
3
For rare indeed is the time for contentions and suits-in-the-forum to him, whose substance is not yearly stored up within, in season, substance which Earth bears, the gift of Ceres.
4
When thou hast satisfied thyself with these,5 then, and not till then, further contentions and strife concerning the pos­ sessions of others:
but it will never again be allowed you to do thus:
let us however forthwith6 put an end to the dispute by righteous judgments which are the best from Jove.
For already in sooth have we divided the inheritance, and thou didst carry off much more by plunder:
flattering much the bribe-swallowing judges,1 whose will it is to give judgment thus.
Fools !
and they know neither how much half exceeds the whole,2 nor how great advantage is in mallow and as­ phodel.
Now3 the gods keep hidden for men their means of sub­ sistence :
for else easily mightest thou even in one day have wrought, so that thou shouldest have enough for the year, even though being idle:
else straightway wouldst thou lay-by the rudder above the smoker and the labours5 of oxen and of toil-enduring mules would be undone.
But Jove in wrath at his heart concealed it, because wily Prometheus6 had beguiled him.
Therefore, I ween, he devised baneful cares7 for men.
And fire he hid, which indeed the good son of Iapetus stole back for mankind from counsellor Jove in a hollow fennel- stalk, after he had escaped the notice of Jove delighting in the thunderbolt.
Him then cloud-compelling Jove addressed in wrath :
" 0 son of Iapetus, knowing beyond all in counsels, thou exultest in having stolen fire, and deceived my wisdom, a severe woe' to thyself and to men that shall come after.
To them now will I give evil instead of fire, wherewith all may delight themselves at heart, hugging their own evil."
So spake he:
and out-laughed2 the sire of men and gods:
but he bade Vul­ can the illustrious with all speed mix earth with watery and endue it with man's voice and strength, and to liken in coun­ tenance to immortal goddesses the fair, lovely beauty of a maiden:
then he bade Minerva teach her work, to weave the highly wrought web;
and golden Aphrodite to shed around her head grace,4 and painful desire,5 and cares that-waste-the limbs:
but to endue her with a shameless mind6 and tricksy manners he charged the conductor, Argicide Mercury.
So he bade:
but they obeyed Jove, the sovereign son of Cronus:
and forthwith out of the earth the famous crippled- god fashioned one like unto a modest maiden, through the counsels of Jove, the son of Cronus:
and the goddess, gleam­ ing-eyed Minerva, girdled and arrayed her:
and around her skin the goddess Graces and august Persuasion hung golden chains, whilst fair-tressed Hours1 crowned her about with flowers of spring:
and Pallas Minerva adapted every orna­ ment to her person.
But in her breast, I wot, conductor Mercury wrought falsehoods, and wily speeches, and tricksy manners, by the counsels of deep-thundering Jove:
and the herald of the gods placed within her, I ween, a winning voiced and this woman he called Pandora, because all, in­ habiting Olympian mansions, bestowed on her a gift, a mis­ chief to inventive men.
But when he had perfected the dire inextricable snare, father Jove proceeded to send to Epimetheus the famous slayer-of-Argus, swift messenger of the gods, carrying her as a gift:
nor did Epimetheus consider how Prometheus3 had told him never to accept a gift from Olympian Jove, but to send it back, lest haply any ill should arise to mortals.
But he, after receiving it, felt the evil, when now he pos­ sessed it.
Now4 aforetime indeed the races of men were wont to live on the earth apart and free from ills, and without harsh la­ bour, and painful diseases, which have brought death on mor- tali.
[For in wretchedness men presently grow old.]
But5 the woman having with her hands removed the great lid from the vessel, dispersed them:
then contrived she baneful cares for men.
And Hope1 alone there in unbroken abode kept remaining within, beneath the verge of the vessel, nor did it flit forth abroad:
for before that, she had placed-on the lid of the vessel, by the counsels of aegis-bearing, cloud-compeller Jove.
But myriad other ills have roamed forth among men.
For full indeed is earth of woes,2 and full the sea:
and in the day as well as at night diseases unbidden haunt mankind, silently bearing ills3 to men, for counsellor Jove hath taken from them their voice.
Thus not in any way is it possible to escape the will of Jove.4
But if you will, another tale will I briefly-tell you well and skilfully, and do you ponder it in your mind, that from the same origin5 are sprung gods and mortal men.
First-of- all the immortals holding the mansions of Olympus made a golden race of speaking men.
[They indeed were under Cronus,1 what time he ruled in heaven.]
And as gods they were wont to live, with a life void-of-care, apart from, and without labours and trouble:
nor was wretched old age at all impending, but, ever the same in hands and feet, did they de­ light themselves in festivals out of the reach of all ills:
and they died, as if overcome by sleep ;
2 all blessings were theirs ;
of-its-own-will the fruitful field would bear them fruity much and ample:
and they gladly used to reap the labours of their hands in quietness along with many good things, being rich in flocks,4 and dear to the blessed gods.
But after that Earth had covered this generation by the bests of mighty Jove, they indeed are daemons,5 kindly, haunting-earth, guardians of mortal men, who, I ween, watch both the decisions of justice, and harsh deeds, going-to-and-fro everywhere over the earth, having wrapt themselves in mist,1 givers of riches as they are:
and this is a kingly function which they have.
Afterwards again the dwellers in Olympian mansions2 formed a second race of silver, far inferior;
like unto the golden neither in shape nor mind:
but for a hundred years 3 indeed a boy was reared and grew up beside his wise mother,4 in hEr house, being quite childish:
but when one happened to come to age and reached the stature of manhood,5 for but a brief space used they to live, suffering griefs through their imprudences:
for they could not keep off rash insult one from the other, nor were they willing to worship the gods, nor to sacrifice6 at the holy altars of the blessed, as it is right men should in their abodes.
Them indeed afterwards, Jove, son of Cronus, buried7 in his wrath, because they gave not due honours to the blessed gods, who occupy Olympus.
Now when earth had ingulfed this race also, they, beneath the ground, are called blessed mortals, second in rank ;
but still honours attends these also.
And yet a third race of speech-gifted men formed father Jove of brass, not at all like unto the silver, formidable and mighty by reason of their ashen-spears:
1 whose care was the mournful deeds of Mars, and insults:
neither did they at all eat wheaten food only?
but had stout-spirited hearts of ada­ mant;
unapproachable.
Now vast force and hands unvan­ quished grew from their shoulders upon sturdy limbs.
These had brazen3 arms, and likewise brazen houses, and with brass they wrought:
for there was not yet dark iron.
They indeed subdued4 beneath their own hands, entered the squalid abode of chilling Hades, inglorious:
for terrible though they were, black Death seized them, and they quitted the bright sun­ light.
But when earth had covered this race also, again Jove, son of Cronus, wrought yet another, a fourth, on the many- nourishing ground, more just and more worthy, a godlike race of hero-men,5 who are called by the former6 age demi- gods over the boundless earth.
And these baneful war, as well as the dire battle-din, destroyed, a part fighting before seven-gated Thebes, in the Cadmean land, for the flocks1 of Œdipus, and part also in ships beyond the vast depths of the sea, when it had led2 them to Troy for fair-haired Helen's sake.
There indeed the end of death enshrouded them;
but to them Jove, the son of Cronus, their sire, having given life and set­ tlements apart from men, made them to dwell at the confines of earth, afar from the immortals.
Among these Cronus rules.
And they indeed dwell with careless spirit in the Isles of the Blest,3 beside deep-eddying Ocean;
blest heroes, for whom thrice in a year doth the fertile soil bear blooming fruits as-sweet-as-honey.
4
Would that then I had not mingled with the fifth race of men, but had either died before, or been born afterward.
5
For now in truth is the iron6 race, neither will they ever cease7 by day, nor at all by night, from toil and wretchedness, cor­ rupt as they are:
but the gods will give them severe cares:
yet nevertheless even for these shall good be mingled with ills.
But Jove will destroy this race also of men endowed with speech, as soon as, immediately after having been born, they become silvery-templed.
1
Nor will sire be like-minded to sons, nor sons at all to parent, nor guest to host, nor com­ rade to comrade, nor will brother be dear, even as it was aforetime, to brother.
But quickly will they dishonour pa­ rents growing old, and will blame them, I ween, addressing them with harsh words, being impious, and unaware of the vengeance of the gods ;
2 nor to aged parents would these pay back the price of their nurture, using the right of might:
a and one will sack the city of another:
nor will there be any favour to the trusty, nor the just, nor the good, but rather they will honour a man that doeth evil and is overbearing;
4 and justice and shame will not be in their hands, and the bad will injure the better man, speaking in perverse speeches, and will swear a false oath.
But on all wretched mortals envy with-its-tongues-of-malice, exulting-in-ills, will attend with hateful look.
Then also in truth to Olympus from earth with-its-broad-ways shall Shame and Retribution, having abandoned men, depart, 1 when they have clad their fair skin in white raiment, to the tribe of the immortals:
but the bane­ ful griefs shall remain behind, and against evil there shall be no resource.
Now then will I speak a fable to kings, wise even though they are.
Thus the hawk addressed the nightingale of varie­ gated-throat, as he carried her in his talons, when he had caught her, very high in the clouds.
She then.
2 pierced on all sides by his crooked talons, was wailing piteously, whilst he victoriously addressed his speech to her. "
Wretch,3 wherefore criest thou ?
'tis a much stronger that holds thee.
Thou wilt go that way by which I may lead thee, songstress though thou art:
and my supper, if I choose, I shall make, or shall let go.
But4 senseless is he who chooses to contend against them that are stronger, and he is robbed of victory, and suffers griefs in addition to indignities.,,So spake the fleet-flying hawk, broad-pinioned bird.
But do thou, Perses, bear the right, nor help-on wrong :
for wrong is both ill 5 to a poor mortal, nor in truth can a well-to-do man easily bear it, for he is also weighed down by it, having fallen upon the penalties of crime;
6 the better way is fo arrive at what is right in the contrary path;
and justice surmounts injury, when it has reached to the end.
When he has suf­ fered,1 the senseless man learns this.
For along with crooked judgments straight runs the avenger of perjury;
2 and a re- listless course is that of Justice, though she be dragged whi- thersoever bribe-swallowing men may lead her, and with perverse judgments deciderupon the existing rights.
And she follows lamenting city and settlements of peoples, clad in mist,3 bringing ill on men, who shall have driven her out, and dis­ pense not a fair decision.
But5 whoso give fair judgments to strangers and to citizens, and do not overstep aught of justice, for these a city blooms, and her peoples flourish within her:
peace rears her young men through the land, nor ever to them doth wide-seeing Jove ordain6 troublous war:
nor ever doth famine, nor ruin, company with men who judge the right, but in festivals they enjoy the fruit of carefully-tended works.
For them bears Earth much substance:
on the mountains the oak7 at its top indeed yields acorns, and midway bees:
the woolly sheep are weighed down with fleeces;
women bear children like unto their sires:
8 in blessings they flourish still:
nor ever travel they on board ship ;
1 but the fertile field yields its increase.
But they, to whom evil, wrong, and hard deeds are a care, to them wide-seeing Jove, the son of Cronus, des.
tines punishment.
Oft2 hath even a whole city reaped the evil fruit of a bad man, who sins and puts in practice deeds of infatuation.
On them then from heaven the son of Cronus is wont to bring great calamity, famine and pestilence at the same time:
so the peoples waste away.
Neither do the women bear children:
and houses come to nought, by the counsels of Olympian Jove ;
and at other times again the son of Cronus either destroys their wide army, or he lays low their walls,4 or in the deep he punishes their ships.
Now do ye too,5 ye judges, ponder likewise yourselves this vengeance:
for being among men and nigh unto them, the immortals observe as many as with perverse judgments wear- and-waste each other, disregarding the punishment of the:
gods.
For on the many-nurturing earth are thrice ten thou­ sand6 immortals, Jove's watchers over mortal men;
who, I weeD, watch both just judgments and daring acts, clad in misty-darkness, and haunting everywhere over the earth.
And Jove's virgin daughter, Justice, besides, is a watcher, illustrious and venerable, with the gods who occupy Olympus.
Yes, and whenever any one wrongs her by perversely railing at her, forthwith taking her seat1 beside Jove, son of Cronus, her sire, she speaks of the unjust mind of mortals, that so the people may atone for the infatuations of kings,2 who, with pernicious intents, turn her the wrong way by speaking judg­ ments perversely.
Heeding these things, ye judges, swallow- ers-of-the-bribe, make straight your sentiments, and entirely forget crooked judgments.
For himself doth a man work evil, in working evils for another, and the evil counsel is worst to him that hath devised it.
3
Jove's eye, having seen all things, and observed all things, also regards these things, if he so please, nor does it escape him, of what nature, in truth, is this justice,4 which the city encloses within.
Now might in truth neither I myself, nor my son, be just among men, since to be a just man is an evil, if so be that the more unjust man is to have the stronger justice.
But this I hope that Jove, delighting in thunders, will not yet bring about.
5Yet, 0 Perses, do thou ponder these things in thine heart, and heed justice in sooth, and forget violence entirely.
For this law hath the son of Cronus ordained for men,6 for fishes indeed and beasts, and winged fowls to eat each other, since justice is not among them:
but to men hath he given justice, which is far best.
For if a man choose to know and speak out what is just, to him also wide-seeing Jove gives felicity;
but whoso in his testimony, wilfully having sworn a false oath, 1 shall have lied, and by it having marred justice, shall have gone astray incurably, of him then the race is left more ob­ scure for the future.
Of a man, however, of-true-oath, the generation is more excellent thereafter.
2
Now will I speak to thee with good intent, thou exceeding foolish Perses.
Badness,3 look you, you may choose easily in a heap:
level is the path, and right near it dwells.
But before virtue the immortal gods have set exertion :
and long and steep and rugged at the first is the way to it,4 but when one shall have reached the summit, then truly it is easy, dif­ ficult though it be before.
This man, indeed, is far-best,5 who shall have understood everything for himself, after having devised what may be best afterward and unto the end:
and good again is he likewise who shall have complied with one advising him well:
but whoso neither himself hath understanding, nor when he hears another, lays it to heart, he on the other hand is a worth­ less man.
Do thou then, ever mindful of my precept, work- on, Perses, of stock divine,' that so famine may hate, and fair-chapleted Demeter love thee, august as she is, and fill' thy garner with substance.
For famine, look you, is ever the sluggard's companion.
And with him gods and men are indignant, who lives a sluggard's life, like in temper to stingless drones,2 which lazily consume the labour of bees, by devouring it:
but to thee let it be a pleasure3 to set in order seemly works, that so thy garners may be full of seasonable substance.
From works men become both rich-in-flocks and wealthy:
by working too, thou wilt be dearer far to immortals and to mortals.
For greatly do they hate sluggards.
Now work is no disgrace,.
but sloth is a disgrace.
And if thou shouldst work, quickly will the sluggard envy thee growing rich;
for esteem and glory accompany wealth.
4
So to a sensible man,5 such as thou wert, to labour is best, if having turned a witless mind from the possessions of others towards work, thou wouldst study.
thy subsistence, as I recommend thee.
But a false shame possesses a needy man, shame6 which greatly hurts or helps men.
Shame, look you, is beside wretchedness, but confidence beside wealth;
and possessions not gotten-by-plunder, but given-by-the-gods, are far best.
For if any one even with his hands shall have taken great wealth by violence, or if he for his part shall have plundered it by his tongue, even as often happens, as soon as in truth gain hath deceived the minds of men, and shamelessness comes suddenly on shame, then,2 I say, easily do the gods darken his name:
the family of such a man is minished, and but for a brief space doth his wealth accompany him.
And alike he who shall have done evil to suppliant and to guest, and he who mounts the couch of his kinsman, for stealthy union3 with his wife, doing acts unseemly ;
and whoso through the senselessness of any one wrongs orphan children, and whoso reproaches an aged parent on the threshold of wretched age, assailing him with severe words ;
against such an one, I say in truth, Jove himself is wroth,4 and at the last, in requital for wrong deeds, lays on him a bitter penalty.
Then keep thou wholly a witless mind from these deeds.
But after thy power do sacrifice to the immortal gods,5 holily and purely, and burn moreover sleek thighs of victims, and at ther times propitiate them with libations, and incense, both when you go to rest, and when the holy light shall have risen:
that so to thee they may entertain a propitious heart and spirit, that thou mayest buy the land of others, not others thine.
Invite the man that loves thee to a feast,1but let alone thine enemy:
and especially invite him that dwelleth near thee:
for if, mark you, anything strange shall have happened at hornet neighbours are wont to come ungirt, but kinsfolk gird themselves first.
A bad neighbour is as great a misfortune as a good one is a great blessing.
3
Who gains a worthy neigh­ bour, hath truly gained a meed of honour:
neither would an ox perish, if there were not a bad neighbour.
4
Duly measure when thou borrowest from a neighbour, and duly repay, in the very measure, and better still, if thou canst,5 that so when in want thou mayest find that which may be relied on in future.
Gain not base gains:
base gains are equal to losses.
Love him that loves thee;
and be nigh him that attaches himself to thee:
and give to him who may have given:
give not to him that hath not given.
To a giver on the one hand some have given :
but to the withholder none give.
A gift is good:
but plunder6 evil,—a dealer of death.
For whatsoever man shall have given willingly,1 he too would give much.
He exult.;
in his gift, and is pleased in his spirit.
But whoso shall have seized, in compliance with his shamelessness, even though it be but a little, yet that little curdles his heart's blood.
2
For if thou shouldst lay up even a little upon a little, and shouldst do this often, soon would even this become great.
He who brings, in addition to what is in store, this man shall escape dark hunger:
nor does that at least which is laid up in the house distress a man.
Better is it that it should be at home, since that which is without is attended with loss.
3
'Tis good to take from what is at hand, but a woe to the spirit to want of that which is far from you:
which truths I bid thee pon­ der.
At the beginning too of the cask, and at the end, take thy fill, but spare it in the middle:
4 for sparingness is too late at the bottom.
Let the recompence fixed for a friend be suf­ ficient, and, as in sport, with a brother even call in witnesses :
5 for trust, I wot, look you, as well as mistrusts, has ruined men.
Nor let a woman with sweeping train1 beguile tby mind, winningly coaxing, and seeking after thy dwelling:
for who trusts a woman, that man, I wot, trusts knaves.
2
And let there be one only-son to tend his father's house:
3 for so shall wealth increase in the dwelling.
But if old, you may die and leave another son.
For easily to more might Jove provide vast wealth.
For of many greater is the care, and greater the gain.
Now if thy spirit desires wealth in thy mind, thus do, and moreover do work upon work.
When the Pleiads, born-of-Atlas, rise, begin thy harvest;
but thy ploughing, when they set.
4
Now these, look you, are hidden for forty nights and days;
5 and again in revolving years they appear when first the sickle is sharpened.
This truly is the law of fields, as well for them who dwell near the sea, as for those who inhabit wooded valleys, a fertile soil afar from the swelling sea:
1 sow stript, plough stript, and reap stript, if thou shouldst wish to gather the works Ceres, all in their seasons, that so each may grow for thee in flue time, lest in anywise, being in need meanwhile, thou shouldst go begging to other people's houses, and accomplish nothing.
3
As e'en now thou hast come to me ;
but I will not add more to thee, nor measure out4 aught in addition:
work, senseless Perses, the works which the gods have destined for mortal,,;
, lest ever, with children and wife grieving thine heart, thou shouldst seek thy subsistence among neighbours, and they should neglect thee.
For twice indeed or thrice perhaps thou wilt obtain, but if thou trouble them further, thou shalt avail nought, but wilt speak many words in vain :
and use­ less will be thy range of words.
5
I recommend thee then to study both payment of debts, and avoidance of hunger.
First of all get a house, and a woman, and a ploughing ox;
a wo­ man purchased, not wedded,6 who may also tend your cattle, and all fitting implements in your house, lest you should ask of another, and he refuse, and you be in want of it, so the season should pass by, and your labour's fruit be lessened Nor put off till to-morrow or the-day-after;
for not, if he works-sluggishly or puts off, doth a man fill his garner:
but diligence increaseth the fruit of toil.
1
A dilatory man ever wrestles with losses.
2When now the violence of the keen sun abates his sweat- causing heat, as all-powerful Jove rains in-the-autumnal-sea­ son, and the body of man moves itself far more lightly,3 for at this season in truth the star Sirius4 comes in the day-time for a short space above the heads of men born-to-death, but has more share of the night ;
then is the timber least worm- eaten,5 if felled with the axe, and sheds its leaves on the ground, and ceases from budding;
then truly, bearing it in mind, fell a timely work.
6
Hew a mortar7 three feet in diameter, and a pestle three cubits, and an axle-tree seven feet long, for, look you, it is very serviceable thus;
but if you should cleave it eight feet, you might also cut from it a mal­ let.
8
And hew a wheel three spans long for the plough-car­ riage of-ten-palms'-length.
1
Many curved blocks of seasoned wood are at hand;
but bring your plough-tail home, when you shall have found it, after search on mountain or in field,2 of ilex-oak:
for this is stoutest for steers to plough;
when­ soever a servant of Minerva,3 having fastened it to the share- beam, has attached it with nails, and fitted it to the pole.
But make two ploughs,4 toiling at them at home, one with plough-tail of one-piece with the share-beam, the other com­ pacted, for 'tis much better thus, if, look you, you should have broken one, you might place the other upon the oxen:
and poles are soundest5 of bay or elm:
but provide yourself a share-beam of oak, a plough-tail of ilex-oak, and a pair of males, steers nine-years-old, (for the vigour of such is not weak,) having the just mean of age, which are best for working.
Such at least would not strive in the furrow and break the plough, and leave there their labour unfinished.
And along with these let a lusty ploughman of forty years follow, having made a meal on a loaf four-squared, divided into eight morsels,1 who, minding his business, will cut the furrow straight,2 no longer peering round among his fellows, but having his heart in his work;
than such an one none other, being younger, is better to disperse the seed,3 and to avoid after-sowing.
For a younger man gapes like one dis­ traught after his fellows.
Mark, too, when from on high out of the clouds you shall have heard the voice of the crane4 uttering its yearly cry, which both brings the signal for ploughing, and points the season of rainy winter, but gnaws the heart of the man that hath no oxen:
then truly feed the crumpled-horned oxen re­ maining within their stalls:
for it is easy to say the word, " Lend me a yoke of oxen, and a wain but easy is it to re­ fuse, saying, There is work for my oxen.
5
Then thinks the man, rich in his own conceit,6 to build a wain, fool as he is, nor knows he this, “ but there are also a hundred planks to a waggon,” 1 for which it is meet first to take thought, to get them within the house.
But when first the season of ploughing has appeared to mortals, even then rouse thyself, thy servants alike and thy­ self, ploughing during the season of ploughing, whether dry or wet, hasting very early, that so thy corn-lands may be full.
In spring torn up the soil and the ground tilled afresh in summer will not mock thy hopes:
and sow thy fallow-land while yet light.
Fallow-land is a guardian-from-death-and- ruin, and a soother of children.
3
Make vows, too, to in fernal, and chaste Demeter 4 that they may load the ripe holy seed-corn of Demeter, when first beginning thy ploughing, when thou hast taken in hand the goad at the extremity of the plough-tail, and touched the back5 of the oxen dragging the oaken peg of the pole with the leathern strap :
6 and let the servant boy behind, carrying a mattock, cause trouble to birds,.
whilst he covers over the seed.
For good-management is best to mortal men, and bad-management worst.
Thus, if the Olympian god himself afterwards give a prosperous end, will the ears bend to the earth with fulness, and thou wilt drive the cobwebs from the bins,2 and I hope that thou wilt rejoice, taking-for-thyself from substance existing within.
3
And in plenty thou wilt come to the white spring, nor wilt thou gaze on others, but another man will be in want from you.
But if at the point of mid-winter4 you shall have ploughed the divine earth, you will have to sit and reap but little, grasping what meets your hand, being covered with dust as you tie it up, not much to your pleasure;
and you will carry it in a basket, while few will eye you with admiration.
5
Now di­ verse at divers seasons is the purpose of Jove, and hard for mortal men to understand.
But if you shall have ploughed late, this would be your remedy:
When the cuckoo sings first on the oak-foliage, and delights mortals over the boundless earth, then let Jove rain three days, 1 and not cease, neither over-topping your ox's hoof-print nor falling short of it:
* thus would a late-plougher be-equal-with an early one.
But duly observe all things in your mind, nor let either the spring becoming white with blossoms, or the showers returning-at- set-seasons, escape your notice.
But pass-by the seat at the brazier's forge,3 and the warm lodging-house in the winter season, when cold keeps men from toils;
at which time an active man4 would greatly improve his household matters;
lest the hardship of baneful winter along with poverty catch thee, and with lean hand thou press a swollen foot.
5
But many ill designs hath the idler, waiting for a vain hope, and in need of subsistence, spoken in his spirit.
And 'tis no good hope that sustains a needy man, sitting at a lodging-house, and who hath not means-of-life sufficient.
Point out, then, to thy servants,6 when it is still mid-summer, " It will not be summer alway:
make you cabins.
"But the month Lenæon, 1 (evil days, all galling the oxen,) this month avoid, and the hoar frosts, which, when the North- wind blows, are hard upon the earth:
the North-wind, which sweeping through steed-rearing Thrace,2 upon the broad deep, is wont to heave it, and land and forest re-echoes:
3 and falling on them, brings to many-feeding earth many lofty- foliaged oaks, and branching pines in the mountain-dells, so then all the immense forest resounds.
4
The wild-beasts cower, and place their tails beneath their legs, though their skin is covered over with hair:
yet even through these, chilly as it is, the North-wind pierces, even though they are shaggy- breasted.
It goes also through the hide of an ox, nor does that keep it out, ay, and blows through the shin of the long- haired goat;
but flocks of sheep, because their fleeces last a whole year,5 the violence of the North-wind does not at all penetrate;
but it makes the old man bent."
6
And through the soft-skinned maiden it does not pierce, 1 who bides within the house beside her dear mother, as yet inexperienced in the deeds of golden Aphrodite ;
when, having bathed her tender form, and anointed herself with rich oil, she shall rest during the night within the house in the wintry season, when the boneless one (the polypus) gnaws at his own foot, in an abode without fire, and in dismal haunts.
For the Sun doth not show him a feeding-range 4 to assail:
but turns toward the nation and city of tawny men, and more slowly shines on the Panhellenes.
5
Then at length the horned and unhorned tenants of the wood, sorely grinding their teeth, fly up and down the woodland thickets, (and this is the care of all of them in their thoughts,) where seeking a shelter they have thick-covered lairs and rocky caves:
then truly are they like to a man that-goes-on-a-stick,6 whose back is well-nigh broken, and head looks toward the ground:
like such an one they roam, shunning the white snow.
Even then, as I bid you, clothe yourself in a defence for your body, 1 a soft cloak, and a frock reaching to the ground;
and into a scant warp weave an abundant woof:
this cast around you, that your hairs may not shiver, nor bristle raised erect about your body.
2
And about your feet bind suitable sandals of the hide of an ox slaughtered with your mighty having covered them thick within with felt.
Then, when the season of cold has come, stitch together with the sinew of an ox the skins of first-born kids, that so upon your back you may throw a shelter from the rain;
and on the head above keep a well-wrought felt hat, that you may not get your ears drenched.
For bleak both Is the morn, when the North-wind falls upon one,4 and in-the-morning over the earth from the starry heaven a wheat-bringing mist is spread above the till­ age of the rich,5 a mist which also having drawn water for itself from ever-flowing streams, and borne high above the earth by a storm of wind, one while indeed rains toward evening, and at another descends-in-blasts, the Thracian North-wind driving the dense clouds.
6
Anticipating this, return home, when you have finished work, lest ever a-dark cloud from the sky should surround you, and drench your skin, and soak your garments;
rather avoid it:
for this win­ try month 1 is most severe, severe to flocks, 2 and severe to men.
Then to oxen give but half, but let man have a larger share, of the allotted food,3 for long nights are great helpers.
Observing these things to the completion of the year, equalize the allowance nights and days, until again Earth, the mother of all, has put forth her various fruits.
4But when after the winter solstice Jove hath fulfilled sixty days of-winter,5 even then it is that the star Arcturus, having left the sacred stream of Ocean, first rises brightly beaming in-the-twilight.
After him is wont to rise Pandion's daugh­ ter, the swallow with-its-plaint-at-dawn,6 for a light to men, when spring is fresh-beginning.
Anticipating this, prune your vines :
1 for 'tis better thus.
When, moreover, the snail climbs up the plants from-off the ground, shunning the Pleiads, then His no longer the season for hoeing the vines:
but you should sharpen sickles, and rouse your servants.
Fly shady seats and sleep at-morn­ ing-time,2 at harvest-season when the Sun parches the skin.
Then make you haste, gather-and-bring home your corn, rising at the dawn, that you may have substance sufficient.
For the morning obtains by lot a third share of the day's work:
The morn, look you, furthers a man on his road, and furthers hint too in his work;
the morn, I say, which, at its appearing, sets many men on their road, and places the yoke on many oxen.
When the artichoke flowers,3 and the tuneful cicala, perched on a tree, pours forth a shrill song oft-times from under his wings, in the season of toilsome summer, then goats are fat­ test, wine is best, women most wanton, and men weakest,4 since Sirius parches head and knees, and body also is dried- up by reason of heat.
But then at last be thine the rocky shade, and Biblian wine,5 a light-well-baked cake, the milk of goats which-are-now-off-their milk,1 and the flesh of a heifer browsing-the-forest, which has not yet calved,2 and of first- born kids-then sit in the shade, and drink moreover dark- hued wine, (having your soul satisfied with viands, and turning your face to catch the brisk-blowing Zephyr,) 3 and the ever-running and forth-gushing spring, which is untroubled- by-mud.
Pour in three cups of water first, and add the fourth of wine.
4Urge your servants, too, to thrash the holy gift of Demeter, when first Orion's strength5 shall have appeared, in a breezy place, and on a well-rounded thrashing-floor:
and by measure store it well in bins.
But when at length you have laid up all your substance, duly prepared within your house, I re­ commend you to get a houseless hireling,6 and to seek a female servant without children:
for a female-servant with children is troublesome.
And maintain a sharp-toothed dog;
7 stini not his food lest ever a day-slumbering man shall have plundered thy property.
Gather in hay and litter, 1 that your oxen and mules may have fodder for the year.
Afterwards refresh the limbs of your servants, and unyoke your pair of oxen.
But when Orion and Sirius shall have reached mid-heaven, and rosy-fingered Aurora looked on Arcturus,2 then, Perses, cull and carry home all thy grape-clusters.
Then expose them to the Sun3 ten days and ten nights, shade them five days, and on the sixth draw into vats the gifts of joyous Bac­ chus.
But when now the Pleiads, Hyads,4 and strong Orion set, then be thou mindful of ploughing in due season.
And may the year5 be prosperous to thee in thy rustic matters.
But if a longing for dangerous6 voyaging seizes you, when fleeing the impetuous might of Orion, the Pleiads sink into the misty deep,7 then rage the blasts of winds of every de- scription:
then also keep no more your ships on the dark sea, but remember to till your land, as I recommend you.
Haul ashore your ship, and cover-it-thick with stones on all sides, 1 that they may keep off the violence of moist-blowing winds, when you have drawn out the keel-plug, that Jove's rain may not rot it.
Store away in your house all the ship's tackle 2 duly arranged, and furl in good order the sails of your deep- skimming bark, and hang up above the smoke your well- wrought rudder.
And wait you for a passage in due season, until it shall have come:
then drag down to the sea your swift ship, and store in it also a prepared freight, that so you may bring home gain, even as my sire and yours,3 very sense­ less Perses, used to sail in ships, in search for honest sub­ stance :
who of old came hither too, when he had traversed much sea, after having left Cuma in Æolia, in dark ship;
forsaking nor plenty, nor riches and wealth, but evil poverty, which Jove gives to men.
Near Helicon he dwelt in Ascra, a wretched hamlet, bad in winter, oppressive in summer, and never genial.:
But thou, Perses, be thou mindful of all works in-their- seasons, and most of all about navigation.
Commend a small vessel:
1 in a large one stow thy freight.
Greater will be thy cargo, and greater thy gain upon gain, that is to say, if the winds keep off evil blasts.
When thou shalt have turned thy silly mind towards merchandise, and desired to escape debts and unpleasant hunger,2 then will I show thee the courses3 of the loud-roaring sea, though neither at all clever in navigation, nor in ships.
For never yet have I sailed in ship, at least across the broad deep, save to Eubœa from Aulis,4 where formerly the Greeks, having waited through the winter, collected together a vast host from sacred Greece 5 for Troy with-its-beauteous women.
And there I crossed over to the games in honour of warlike Amphidamas6 and to Chalcis :
the numerous prizes duly proclaimed his noble- spirited sons had set up:
there boast I that, as victor in the lay, I carried off an eared tripod.
This I offered to the Muses of Helicon, where 1 first they initiated me in the tuneful song.
Thus much experience only have I had in ships with-many-nails:
but even so I will speak the mind of aegis-bearing Jove:
for the Muses have taught me to sing the divine song.
2
For fifty days after the summer solstice,3 when summer, a season of toil, has come to an end, sailing is seasonable for mortals:
neither then would you founder your ship, nor would the sea destroy the crew, unless, that is, of-set-purpose, earth-shaking Neptune, or Jove, king of immortals, should choose to destroy them:
for with them is the end of good and bad alike.
But at that season the breezes are clear,4 and the deep free-from-danger:
then in security, relying on the winds, drag down to sea your swift ship, and duly stow in it all the cargo:
but hasten with all speed to come back home;
wait not the new wine, and au­ tumn rain,5 the coming winter, and the terrible blasts of the South-wind, which is wont to disturb the sea, when it fol­ lows Jove's abundant rain, in autumn, and renders the deep dangerous.
Another season of sailing, amongst men, is in the spring.
1
When in truth at the first, as large as the crow, advancing, has left her foot-print, just so large leaves will appear to a man on the top of the fig tree's branch, then, I say, the sea may be traversed ;
but this is a spring voyaged I praise it not, for it is not pleasant to my thinking, because snatched in haste:
3 with difficulty could one avoid evil;
yet even this too men do, through foolishness of mind:
for riches are life to wretched mortals.
4
But dreadful it is to die in the waves:
now thee I recommend to consider all these things in thy mind, as I speak them.
Nor do thou stow all thy substance in hollow ships, but leave most behind, and make the lesser share thy cargo.
For shocking it is to meet with loss in the waves of the sea;
and sad, if when thou hast lifted an ex­ cessive weight on thy waggon, thou crush the axle, and the loads be wasted.
Observe moderation.5
In all the fitting- season is best.
-And at mature age bring home a wife to thine house, when thou art neither very far short of thirty years,6 nor hast added very much thereto, for such a marriage, look you, is seasonable.
And let the woman be in her bloom four years, and be married in the fifth.
1
Marry a maiden, too, that you may teach her chaste morals.
Most of all, marry her who lives near you, when you have duly looked round on everything, lest you should marry a cause-of-mocking 2 for your neighbours.
For nothing better does a man gain than the good wife, whilst than the worse, the banquet-seeker, nought else is more dreadful:
though a man be strong, she consumes him without a torch,3 and consigns him to unripe old age.
And be duly regardful of the vengeance of the blest Im­ mortals :
neither make thy friend equal to a brother:
but, if thou shalt have made him so, be not the first to do him wrong;
and lie not, for talking's sake ;
4 though, if he should begin either to speak aught distasteful, 5 or even to do it against you, requite him just twice as much, in thy resentment;
but if again he lead the way to friendship, and be willing to give satisfaction, accept it;
it is a wretched man, be sure, that gets now one, now another for his friend,6 but thy mind let not thy countenance at all convict.
Neither be called the host of many, nor the host of none, nor comrade of the evil, nor re­ viler of the good.
Nor ever have-the-cruelty to reproach a man with wretched, heart-consuming poverty,1 the behest of the ever-living gods.
The best treasure, look you, among men is that of a sparing tongue,2 and the most grace is that of one which moves measuredly.
If you have spoken ill, haply you will yourself hear worse.
Neither be uncourteous in a feast of many guests, arising from a general payment:
3 for the pleasure is then greatest, the expense least.
Nor ever in the morning make libations of dark wine to Jove with hands unwashen,4 nor to the other gods.
For they on their part heed not, and more, they spurn your prayers.
Neither do thou ever cross the limpid wave of ever-flowing rivers5 with thy feet, that is, before thou shalt have prayed, gazing on the fair streams, and having thine hands wash en with the pleasant clear water.
Whoso shall have crossed a river having his hands unwashen through perverseness, with him the gods are wroth, and are wont to give him griefs after­ ward.
And do not at a festive banquet of the gods pare from the finger6 with bright steel the dry from the fresh.
Nor ever place a can above the bowl, when men drink:
1 for a deadly fate is wrought in it.
Nor, when building a house, leave it not-finished-off, lest, mark you, perching on it, the cawing crow should croak.
2
Nor, having taken from cauldrons not-yet-used-for-sacrifice, eat, or wash thyself:
since in these, too, there is a penalty.
Nor let a lad of twelve years sit inactively;
3 for 'tis better not, since it makes a man unmanly:
nor yet a child of twelve months;
for this is all the same.
Nor, being a man, cleanse thy skin in the woman's bath ;
for on this, too, there is a dismal penalty for a time.
Nor, if thou hast chanced upon lighted sacrifices, mock at rites of hid­ den import ;
4 the god, look thou, is wroth at this also.
Nor ever defile the current of rivers flowing seaward, nor foun­ tains, but specially avoid it.
For this is nowise best.
Thus do, and avoid the evil rumour of mortals.
For evil report is light to lift with all ease,1 but painful to bear, and difficult to set aside.
And no rumour wholly dies away, which many peoples shall have spread abroad;
in sooth she, too, is a kind of goddess.
Mind well, too, and teach thy servants fittingly the days 2 appointed of Jove;
to Mit, the 30th day of each month, the best both for inspecting work done, and distributing allotted sustenance, when the peoples observe it, in deciding the right.
3
For these following days are from counselling Jove.4
In the first place, the first, the fourth, and the seventh, is a holy day:
for on this last, Latona gave-birth-to Apollo of-the-golden-sword:
5 the eighth and ninth;
these are two days, I ween, of the month far advancing, for getting ready the works of mortal' , und the eleventh and twelfth, both in truth are good, the one for shearing sheep, the other for reap­ ing laughing corn:
but the twelfth is far better than the eleventh, for on it, look you, the high-hovering spider1 spins his threads in the long summer day, when also the wise ant harvests his heap.
On this day, too, a woman should set up her loom, and put forth her work.
But on the thirteenth of the beginning of the month 2 avoid commencing your sowing :
though to set plants it is best.
The sixteenth, however,3 is very unprofitable to plants, but auspicious for the birth of men, though for a girl it is not propitious, either to be first born, or to be joined in wedlock.
Nor, in truth, is the first sixth day4 suitable for the birth of girls, but a favourable day for cutting kids and flocks of sheep, and for enclosing a fold for sheep.
Fortunate is the day on which a man is born:
but it is fond5 both of uttering rail­ leries, and of falsehoods, and wily words, and stealthy fond discourses.
On the eighth of the month emasculate the boar and loud bellowing bull, and on the twelfth the toil-enduring mules.
But on the longest twentieth day,6 in broad day, generate a wise man, for he will be very cautious of mind.
And lucky for raising sons is the tenth day, and the four­ teenth for girls.
On this, too, tame sheep, and trailing-footed, crumple-horned oxen, and sharp-toothed dog, and patient mules, applying your hand to them.
1
But be cautious in your mind to avoid gnawing the heart with grief on the twenty- fourth and fourth of the month:
it is in truth a very per­ fect day.
1Then on the fourth2 of the month lead home a bride, after having examined the omens, which are best in this matter.
But avoid the fifth days, since they are both mischievous and destructive;
for on the fifth 'tis said that the furies attend upon Orcus born on that day,3 whom strife brought forth, as a woe to the perjured.
On the seventeenth4 watch well, and cast upon the well-rounded thrashing-floor Demeter's holy gift;
and let the wood-cutter cut timbers for chamber- furniture, and many blocks for naval purposes, which are fit for ships.
And on the fourth begin to put together slight vessels.
But the nineteenth is a better day towards evening.
And the first ninth day in a month is wholly harmless5 to mortals;
since lucky indeed is this day for planting and for birth, to man as well as woman;
and never is it a day alto- gether bad.
Now few, again, know that the twenty-ninth1 of the month is best both for broaching a cask, and placing a yoke on the neck of oxen and mules and fleet-footed steeds:
then draw down your swift, many-benched ship to the dark sea;
yet few call it a truthful day.
On the fourth day open your cask:
the fourteenth is a day sacred beyond all others :
and few know that the fourth after the twentieth of the month is best,2 at the break of day :
but toward evening it is worse.
These days indeed are to men-on-the-earth a great benefit.
But the others falling-between 3 are harmless, bringing nothing of moment.
One man praises one day, another another.
But few know them.
Sometimes a day is a step-mother,4 sometimes a mother.
Blest and fortunate is he who knowingly does all these things with reference to these days, unblamed by the immortals, discerning omens, and avoiding transgressions.
AT the libations to Jove,1 what else can be better to cele­ brate, than the god himself, ever mighty, ever king, driver ot the earthborn,2 justice-dealer to the Celestials ?
How, then, shall we celebrate him, as Dictæan, or Lycaean :
much in doubt is my mind;
since his birth-place is disputed.
Thou, Jove, men say, wast born on the mountains of Ida:
3 and thou, Jove, others affirm in Arcadia :
which of the twain, 0 father, have uttered-falsehood.
The Cretans are ever liars:
1 for a tomb to thee, 0 king, the Cretans have constructed.
But thou art not dead.
For thou existest ever.
Thee Rhea bare on the Parrhasian2 height where the mountain is most screened with bushes.
TheRce is the spot sacred, neither doth any-thing-that-moveth-on-the-earth, when in need of Ilithyia, nor any woman, draw nigh to it;
but the Apidanes 3 call it the olden child-bed of Rhea.
There when thy mother had laid thee down from her divine lap, straightway she be­ gan to seek a stream of water, wherein she might bathe the filth from her offspring,4 and lave in it thy skin.
But not yet was vast Ladon flowing, nor Erymanthus, clearest of rivers :
as yet all Arcadia was unwatered, (though it was destined afterwards to be exceeding-well-watered,) since at that time, when Rhea loosed her zone in child-birth,5 of a truth moist loon reared many hollow1 oaks above it, and Melas bare many waggons, and above Carnion,2 moist though it noto is, many serpents had made their lurking-holes, and a man would go a-foot over Crathis, and over pebbly Metope3 thirsting, though the plenteous water was lying 'neath his feet.
Then, I wot, constrained by perplexity, august Rhea said :
" Dear Earth, do thou, too, bear;
for easy are thy throes."
The goddess spake, and having uplifted on high 4 her great arm smote the mountain with a staff.
So it was rent widely asunder at her bidding, and poured forth a vast flood.
Therein having cleansed thy skin,5 0 king, she swathed thee, and gave thee to Neda to carry into a secret-place in Crete, that so thou mightest be reared stealthily:
to Neda most honoured 6 of the Nymphs, who then were her mid-wives, and eldest-born after Styx and Philyra.
7
Nor did the goddess pay back vain thanks:
for she named that flood Neda, which in full force somewhere over-against the very city of the Caucones,1 which is called Leprium, mingles with the sea;
2 and the sons of Lycaon's daughter,3 the she- bear, drink it as the most ancient water.
When the nymph was leaving Thenæ, carrying thee, father Jove, towards Cnossus, (Thenæ was nigh to Cnossus,) then fell thy navel, 0 god:
whence4 afterward the Cydonians call that plain Omphalian.
But thee, 0 Jove, the associates of the Cory­ bantes, the Dictæan Meliae,5 took-to-their-arms:
Adrastea lulled thee in a golden cradle:
6 thou suckedst the full teat of the goat- Amalthea, 7 and moreover atest sweet honey.
For on a sudden sprung up the labours of the Panacrian bee on the mountains of-Ida, which men call Panacra.
But around thee vigorously danced the Curetes1 the war-dance, rattling their arms, that so Cronus might hear with his ears the sound of the shield, and not thee crying.
Nobly didst thou thrive, and nobly wast thou reared, heavenly Jove.
And quickly didst thou grow up, quick came for thee the first growth of beard.
Yet whilst still boyish thou musedst on all things pro­ per-to-mature-age :
2 wherefore even thy brothers, though being elder-born, grudged not heaven to thee to hold as thine allotted home.
Now, ancient poets were not altogether true.
They said the lot divided homes to the sons of Cronus in- three-divisions;
but who, that was not foolish, would draw lots in the case of Olympus and Hades?
For on equal terms 'tis meet to draw lots:
but these differ in the highest degree.
If I must fable, fain would I fable what might convince the ears of my audience.
4
Not lots, but deeds of prowess, and thy Force and Might, which thou placedst near thy seat,5 made thee sovereign of the gods.
And thou madest a bird distin­ guished-far-beyond others, messenger of thy portents,6 which I would thou wouldst manifest propitious to my friends.
Thou chosest, too, the foremost of young men;
not thou the know­ ing in naval-matters, nor the shield-brandishing warrior, no, nor the poet;
but thou didst give up these at the instant to the lesser blessed-gods, 1 different cares for different gods to care for;
whilst for thyself thou chosest-out rulers-of-cities themselves;
beneath whose hand is the tiller-of-the soil, and the skilful-in-arms, the rower, and all things.
For what is not beneath the power of a ruler ?
For example,2 we tell of the smiths of Vulcan, the armed- men of Mars, and the hunters of tunic-clad3 Diana, and of Phœbus them that duly know the courses of song.
But from Jove are kings ;
4 since nothing is more godlike than Jove- sent kings.
Therefore thou determinedst them to be thine allotment, and gayest them cities to guard, 5 but thou thyself sittest in high citadels, overlooking such as govern the people under unjust judgments, and such as rule in the opposite manner.
And amongst them thou hast placed affluence, and abundance of fortune, among all indeed, but not certainly in equal share.
Now one may guess this in our ruler,1 for ex­ ceeding widely hath he distanced the rest.
At even I wot he achieves what he may have devised at dawn ;
2 at even the matters of-chief-moment, and lesser matters at the time when he has conceived them.
But others accomplish some projects in a year, others not in one year:
whilst from others thou hast thyself entirely cut short accomplishment, and frustrated their eager-desire.
3All hail, supreme son of Cronus, giver of good things, giver of security!
Thy works who can celebrate ?
There hath not been, there will not be, one.
Who could celebrate the works of Jove ? 4 Hail, Sire, hail again.
But grant excellence and wealth.
Neither without worth can5 wealth prosper men, nor worth without wealth.
Give, then, both worth and wealth.
'How hath the laurel-shoot of Apollo heaved !6
How the whole of the shrine !
Afar, afar be ye, sinners.
7
Now verily doth Phœbus knock-at the doors with beauteous foot.
See you not ?1 The Delian palm has nodded in a pleasant fashion on a sudden, and the swan sings sweetly on the air.
Now of your own accord 2 fall-back, ye bolts of the doors, and of-your­ selves, ye bars.
For no longer is the god afar-off.
Make ready, ye young men, for the song and the choir.
3
Not to every one doth Apollo manifest himself, but to only the good.
4
Whoso shall have seen him, great is he:
small that man who hath not seen him.
We shall behold thee, 0 Far-darter, and shall be no more of small account.
Nor silent lyre nor noiseless tread 5 should the servants of Phœbus have, when he sojourns among them, if they have a mind to accomplish marriages, and to cut off gray hair, 1 and that their walls should stand firm on ancient foundations.
I honour the boys, since the lyre is no more idle.
Listen, and keep-holy-silence2 at the song in honour of Apollo.
Even the deep keeps-holy-silence,3 when minstrels celebrate on lyre or bow the implements of Lycorean Phœ- bus.
Nor does Thetis, his mother, plaintively4 bewail Achilles, whenever she has heard the 10 Pæan, Io Paean.
And even the tearful rock defers its sorrow, the rock, which remains fixt, a dripping stone, in Phrygia, the marble in the place of a woman, with a mournful utterance.
5 Sing Io !
Io!
it is ill to contend with the gods.
Whoso contends with im­ mortals, would contend with my king, and whoso with my king, would strive even with Apollo.
Apollo will honour the choir, because it sings to his taste;
for he is able, seeing that he sits at Jove's right hand.
6
Nor will the choir sing Apollo for one day only;
for he is celebrated-in-many-hymns.
Who would not easily sing of Apollo ?
Golden are both the garment, and the clasp of Apollo, his lyre, his Lyctian bow,.
and his quiver:
golden, too, his sandals;
for Apollo is rich in gold, and has also many possessions.
One might guess this at Pytho.2 And, indeed, he is ever-beauteous, ever young;
never bath so much as a little down3 come upon the soft cheeks of Phœbus.
But his locks distil odorous oils upon the ground.
Not mere oil do the tresses of Apollo drop down, but healing itself:
4 and in whatsoever city those dews shall have fallen on the ground, all things are wont to become safe.
Great, too, in art is no one so much as Apollo.
He has obtained for his lot the archer,5 he the minstrel;
for to Phoe­ bus bow as well as song is intrusted.
To him, likewise, be­ long divinations and diviners:
and from Phoebus physicians have learned the art-of-delaying death.
6
Phœbus also we call Nomian, even from that time, even from the time when by Amphrysus7 he tended the yoked mares, fired with love for the young Admetus.
Easily would the cattle-pasture be­ come abundant, nor would the bleating she-goats 1 lack younglings, on which, as they pasture, Apollo bath cast his eyes.
Nor would sheep be without milk, or unfruitful, but all would suckle lambs, and the ewe that-bare-one would quickly become a dam-of-twins.
2
And following Phœbus men are wont to measure out cities.
For Phoebus ever de­ lights in founding cities, and Phoebus himself lays their foundations.
3
At four years of age Phoebus laid the first foundations in fair Ortygia, near the circular lake.
The huntress Artemis was wont to bring constantly the heads of Cynthian she-goats,4 but from them Apollo was weaving an altar.
The foundations he laid with horns;
from horns he built the altar itself, and placed under it walls of horn around.
Thus first learned Phoebus to raise foundations.
Phœbus, too, pointed-out to Battus my fertile native-country,5 and to his people entering Libya a crow, propitious to the leader-of- a colony,l was guide, and sware that he would give walls to our sovereigns.
Apollo ever keeps-his-oath-inviolate.
Many, O Apollo, call thee Boedromian,2 many Clarian3 (for every­ where thy name is manifold).
But I style thee Carnean :
4 it is my country's wont to do so.
To thee, 0 Carnean god, Sparta, this was the first settlement;
a second, again, was Thera ;
a third, I wot, the city of Cyrene.
From Sparta the sixth descendant of CEdipus5 led thee to the colonizing of Thera, and from Thera vigorous Battus consigned thee to the country of Asbystis.
6
He built thee a very noble temple;
and in the city instituted a yearly festival, at which many bulls,7 great king, fall on their haunches for the last time.lo!
lo!
Carnean god, much supplicated:
thine altars carry flowers indeed in spring as many and various as the seasons bring, when the Zephyr breathes dew;
and in winter the sweet crocus.
And ever hast thou eternal fire, 1 nor ever do ashes consume yesterday's coal.
Greatly, I wot, joyed Phœbus, when Enyo's belted heroes danced with brown Libyan women,2 when the settled seasons of the Carnean festival arrived for them.
But the Dorians were not yet able to approach the fountain of Cyre,3 but were inhabiting Aziris thick-girt with woods.
These the god himself beheld, and showed them to his bride,4 as he stood on the point of Myrtusa, when the daughter of Hypsæus slew the lion, ravager of the oxen of Eurypylus.
5No other choir saw Apollo more worthy of a god than that, nor to other city gave he so many advantages as tc Cyrene, being mindful of the ancient rape:
no, nor do the Battiadæ them elves honour other god more than Phœbus We hear Io, Io Paean !
for the Delphic people invented this refrain first of all in honour of thee, when thou didst dis­ play the far-range of thy golden bow and arrows.
As thou wentest down to Pytho there encountered thee a monstrous beast, 1 a terrible serpent.
This monster thou killedst, hurl­ ing one swift arrow after another:
while the people shouted in acclamation, " lo !
Io Psean !
let fly thy shaft;
thy mother bare thee a helper 2 from-the-first."
And thus thou art celebrated even from that time.
The envious-tale spake stealthily to Apollo's ears, I love not the minstrel3 who does not sing as much as doth the sea.
The envious speech Apollo both spurned with his foot, and answered thus :
"
Vast is the tide of the Assyrian river, but it draws with it the many defilements of earth, and much refuse with its flood.
4
Yet not from every river do the Melissæ 5 carry water for Ceres, but a small fount from a sacred spring, which rills pure and unpolluted, the choicest of its kind,6 from this they draw Hail, King !
and may Momus go thither, where ruin dwells.
WE celebrate Artemis, for she is not light1 to minstrels to forget, Artemis, to whom the bow and hare-shooting, and the wide choir2 and disporting on the mountains are a care:
com­ mencing, how that when sitting, yet a blooming child, on the knees of her sire, she thus addressed her parent:
" Grant me, kind father, to preserve eternal maidenhood,3 and many- names, that so Phoebus may not vie with me.
4
And give me arrows and bow.
Grant it, sire !
I ask not a quiver of thee, nor a large bow:
the Cyclopes will forthwith forge me arrows, and fashion me a flexible bow:
but I ash both bring­ ing-of-light,5 and to be girt as far as the knee6 with a tunic of-coloured-border, that I may slay wild beasts.
And give me sixty ocean-nymphs1 to-form-my- chorus, all of-the- same-age, all yet unmarriageable maidens.
Give me likewise as attendants twenty Amnisian nymphs,2 who may duly take care of my buskins, and, when I no longer am shooting lynxes and stags, may tend my fleet dogs.
Give me all mountains, and assign to me any city,3 whichsoever thou choosest.
For 'twill be rare, when Artemis shall go down into a city.
On mountains will I dwell;
then only will I mingle in the cities of men, when women harassed by sharp throes call on a helper,4 women whom when I was first born the fates destined me to aid, because my mother, both when bringing me forth, and when bearing me in her womb, suffered no pains,5 but without labours deposited me from her lap."
Thus having spoken, the maiden wished to touch the beard of her sire, and oft1 out-stretched her hands to-no-purpose;
until at last she might touch it.
Then her father assented with a smile, and said, as he fondled her,2 " When goddesses bear me such offspring, little care should I have for the wrath of jealous Juno:
Have, child, whatever you ask of-your-own-choice ;
but other yet greater gifts will your sire bestow.
Thrice ten cities will I present to you, not one fenced-town only ;
thrice ten cities for you, which shall not learn to honour any other god, but thee alone, and shall learn to be named the cities of Artemis.
And I will give thee many cities to measure out in common with other gods, on the continent, and islands:
in all shall be altars and sacred groves of Artemis,4 and thou shalt be guardian over ways and harbours."
Thus spake he, and with his head ratified his speech.
Then went the maiden toward Leucus, a mountain of Crete, tressed with woods;
5 and thence toward ocean:
and many Nymphs chose she for herself, all nine-years-old, all yet unmarriageable damsels.
Right glad was the river Cæratus,1 glad was Tethys, because she was sending her daughters as attendants on the daughter of Latona.
And straightway she proceeded to visit the Cy­ clopes:
whom she found in the island Lipara,2 (Lipara of- later-times, but then its name was Meligunis,) at the anvils of Vulcan standing around the red-hot-mass.
3
Now a great work was being urged forward.
They were forging a horse-trough4 for Neptune.
But the Nymphs feared, when they saw the terrible monsters, like unto the jutting-crags5 of Ossa;
for all of them had beneath their brows an eye with-one-pupil, resembling a shield made- of-four-ox-hides, fearfully glancing6 from under them;
and when they heard the noise of the anvils sounding loudly,7 and the great blast of the bellows, and the heavy groaning of the Cyclopes themselves.
For AEtna was echoing, and Trin­ acria,1 settlement of the Sicani, was echoing, and Italy, her neighbour, whilst Cyrnus was uttering a loud sound in an­ swer, when they lifted above their shoulders2 their hammers, and toiled with great effort,3 striking with-alternate-bursts either brass or iron gleaming from the forge.
Wherefore the Ocean-nymphs had not the courage either to look them in the face,4 or to hear their din, without anxiety.
And no marvel!
for those monsters, even those daughters of the blessed gods, who are no longer very-little, never behold without shudder­ ing.
But when any one of the maidens acts disobediently towards her mother, that mother calls for the Cyclopes, Arges or Steropes, to her child.
Then from the interior of the house comes Mercury,5 besmeared with black ashes.
Straight­ way he scares6 the child, and she sinks into her mother's bosom, placing her hands over her eyes.
Thou, damsel, too, though at an earlier period, when as yet three-years-old, (when Latona came with thee in her arms, at the invitation of Vulcan, that he might present thee natal-gifts,)1 as Brontes placed thee on his brawny knees, graspedst the shaggy hair from his huge chest, and didst tear it out perforce:
so even to this time the middle of his chest is hairless, just as when mange having settled on the hairy scalp2 of a man is wont to consume his hair.
Therefore very boldly didst thou then address them thus:
" Ye Cyclopes, come now, forge me likewise a Cydonian bow, and arrows, and a hollow quiver for my darts, for I too, like as Apollo, am a child of Latona.
And if I with my bow shall have captured a wild beast,3 or some huge wild-animal, that shall the Cyclopes eat.
"Thou saidst.
They fulfilled thy mandate, and quickly, 0 goddess, didst thou arm thyself;
4 and straight go again after the whelps, and come to Pan's Arcadian abode.
5
Now he was cutting-up the flesh of a Maenalian lynx, that his bitches with sucking whelps might eat food.
Then the bearded god gave thee two hounds, pieballed,l and three with-hanging-ears, and one spotted ;
which, I ween, dragging backwards very lions, when they have clutched their necks, are wont to draw them while still alive to their kennel:
seven Spartan-hounds too he gave swifter than the winds,2 which are most fleet in pursuing fawns as well as the hare not-shutting-its eyes, and in mark­ ing the lair of the stag, and where are the haunts of the por­ cupine, and in tracking the footstep of the gazelle.
Departing thence, (and with thee sped thy hounds,) thou didst find at the jutting base3 of the Parrhasian mount bound­ ing does, a rich prize, which ever were wont to pasture on the banks of dark-pebbled Anaurus,4 larger in size than bulls, and gold was gleaming from their antlers.
On a sudden thou wast amazed, and saidst to thine heart, " This would be a first- fruit-of-the-chase worthy of Artemis."
The whole number was five.
And four thou didst capture, by swiftly-running, without the chase of dogs, to bear thy swift car.
The other one, having fled, by Juno's counsels, across the river Celadon,1 that so it might become in after-time a labour to Hercules, the Cerynean hill received.
O virgin Artemis, slayer of Tityus,2 golden are thine arm.-;
and zone, and thou yokedst a chariot of-gold, and on the stags didst throw golden bits.
But whither first began thy car drawn-by-horned-cattle3 to lift thee?
O'er Thracian Haernus, whence comes the hurricane of Boreas, bringing to the cloak- less adverse frost.
And where didst thou cut thy pine- torch ?
From what flame didst thou kindle it ?
On Mysian Olympus ;
4 but thou sheddest into it the breath of unex- tinguished flame, which, I wot, thy sire's lightnings let fall.
And how oft madest thou trial of thy silver bow, 0 goddess ?
First against an elm,5 next at an oak didst thou discharge it ;
then thirdly at a wild-beast.
The fourth time thou didst aim it no more at an oak, but at a city of unrighteous men, who both against themselves, and as touching strangers, were per­ forming many sinful acts.
Wretched are they, on whom thou shalt inflict1 heavy wrath !
Their beasts murrain consumes, and hail their till­ age :
and old men mourn2 over sons, whilst the wives either die stricken in child-bed, or bear children in exile;
nothing of them stands erect on a sound footing.
3
But for those, whom thou shalt have beheld smilingly and propitiously, for them their field brings forth the ear-of-corn,4 well thrives the birth of cattle, well their wealth, neither come they to the tomb, save when they bear some weight-of-many years.
5
Nor doth division, which is wont to mar families even though well-established, wound their race;
but around one hospit- able-board brothers' wives and husbands' sisters1 place their seats.
O
Lady, amongst these may he be, whosoever is a true friend to me, and may I myself be likewise, 0 Queen :
may the song ever be my care, wherein shall be the nuptials of Latona, wherein mention of thee shall be frequent, and Apollo, and the whole of thy labours, thy dogs, thy bows, thy chariots, which lightly bear thee conspicuous as thou art, when thou drivest to the mansion of Jove.
There they re­ ceive, meeting thee in the vestibules, thine arms, Acace­ sian Mercury,2 Apollo the wild beast which thou mayest be bringing:
before that, I mean, strong Hercules came, for now no longer bath Phœbus this duty.
For such a hero the Tirynthian stands unwearied before the doors ex­ pecting, if haply thou shouldest come bringing some rich dainty.
And at him all the gods laugh incessantly, and espe­ cially his mother-in-law herself when from thy chariot he brings a very large bull, or a yet gasping wild boar by his hinder foot,4 and instructs thee much with this shrewd speech:
"
Cast at noxious beasts, that mortals may address thee, like me, as helper.
Leave goats and hares to feed on the mountains;
for what harm can goats and hares do ?
Wild boars spoil the tillage,5 wild boars the young trees;
and wild-bulls are a great evil to men.
Cast 'hine arrows at these also."
So is he wont to speak, and quickly toils he over the huge beast.
For, though changed into a god as to his limbs 'neath the Phrygian oak, 1 he has not ceased from his voracity;
still with him is present that paunch,2 with which of old he encountered Theodamas ploughing.
And for thee the Amnisian nymphs3 rub down the stags loosed from under the yoke, and bring before them much fod­ der, having mown from the mead of Juno the quick-growing trefoil,4 which also Jove's steeds eat;
and they are wont to fill golden troughs5 with water, that so the stags may have a pleasing draught.
But thou comest thyself to thy sire's abode, and the gods all alike invite thee to a seat, but thou sittest beside Apollo.
-Now when the nymphs shall encircle thee with a choir, nigh to the sources of Egyptian Inopus,6 or Pitane,l (for thine, too, is Pitane,) or at Limnæ, or where, O goddess, thou hast come from Scythia to dwell in Alæ Araphenides, for thou hatest the solemn rites of Tauri, then may my heifers not be cleaving for hire, under other plough­ man, a-day's-work of fallow-land.
2
For surely lame, and weary in their necks, they would come to their stall, e'en though they should be Tymphæan,3 nine years old and strong- with-their-horns, such as are far best in cleaving a deep fur­ row ;
since never hath the Sun god passed-by that beauteous choir, but stays his chariot to gaze on it, and so the days are lengthened.
4
But which of isles, I pray, and what mountain pleaseth thee most ?
What harbour, what kind of city ?
And whom of Nymphs lovest thou specially ?
what heroines hast thou taken for companions ?
Say, goddess, thou to us, and I will sing to others.
1
Of isles Doliche,2 of cities Perga pleaseth thee, Taygete of mountains, ay, and the harbours of Euripus.
And far be­ yond others lovedst thou a Gortynian nymph, a slayer-of- stags, Britomartis,3 of-certain-aim:
fired with the love of whom Minos of yore traversed the mountains of Crete.
But the Nymph one while was hiding herself under the thick- foliaged oaks, at another time in the water-meadows ;
4 whilst he for nine months was resorting to steeps and crags, and ceased not the pursuit, until when, now well-nigh caught, she leapt into the sea from topmost jutting-crag, and sprang into the nets of fishermen, which saved her;
whence in-after- time Cydonians call the Nymph, Dictynna,5 and the moun.
tarn from which the Nymph leaped, Dictæan:
and set-up altars to her, and still perform sacrifices.
Now the chaplet on that day1 is either pine or mastich-tree, but myrtle their hands touch not.
For 'twas then that a myrtle-branch en­ tangled itself in the maiden's robes, when she was flying:
whence she was very wroth with the myrtle.
0 sovereign Upis,2 of fair countenance, bearer-of-light, thee, too, the Cre­ tans call by a surname from that Nymph.
But, in truth, thou tookest-for-a-companion Cyrene,3 to whom of old thou gayest of thine own accord two hunting-dogs, with which the damsel, daughter of Hypseus, gained the prize beside the tomb of Pelias.
4
And thou madest the auburn-haired wife of Cephalus, son-of-Deion, thy comrade-in-the chase :
5 yea, and they say thou lovedst fair Anticlea,6 even as thine own eyes, Nymphs, who first bare thy swift bow, and quivers holding.
arrows upon their shoulders;
but their right shoulders were free from burden, and their bosom was ever exposed to view.
And furthermore, thou approvedst altogether Atalanta,' the strong-of-foot, the boar-slaying daughter of lasius, the Ar­ cadian, and taughtest her both hunting-with-dogs and skill in shooting.
With her not the invited hunters of the Caly­ donian boar find fault.
For the tokens of victory entered Arcadia, and still it preserves the teeth of the beast.
2Nor do I suspect that Hylaeus, and senseless Rhæcus,3 even though they hate her, will in Hades find fault with the archer:
for their loins, with the blood of which the Mænalian ridge flowed, will not join-them-in-their-lie.
August goddess, of-many-fanes, of-many-cities, all hail !
Chitone ! 4 colonist of Miletus.
For Neleus took thee for his leader, when with his ships he put-out-to-sea from Athens.
Goddess of Chesium and Imbrasus,1 filling the first-seats:
for thee too Agamemnon dedicated the rudder of his ship in thy temple, a charm against stress-of-weather,2 when thou didst imprison the winds for him, when the Achaean ships were sailing to trouble the cities of the Trojans, in wrath for Rhamnusian Helen's sake.
In truth it was to thee that Prætus founded two temples ;
3 one indeed of thee as girl-protectress, because thou broughtest together for him his daughters roam­ ing over the Azenian mountains ;
the other to thee as mild goddess at Lussi, because thou hadst removed their wild nature from his daughters.
To thee also the Amazons eager- after war, of-old on the sea-shore of Ephesus4 set up an image beneath a beech-tree's trunk;
and Hippo performed a sacred rite to thee ;
and they, 0 sovereign Upis, danced an- armed-dance around, first an armed dance with shields, and next in a ring, when they had made a broad chorus, and shrill pipes sounded a sweet accompaniment, that they might all together beat the ground;
(for not as yet did they bore the bones of fawns,1 a work of Minerva, hurtful to the stag,) yet the sound ran to Sardis, and to the Berecynthian range.
They with their feet kept making a loud tramping sound, whilst their quivers rattled with the movement.
Now around that image truly in-after-time a broad temple has been built:
than which the dawn shall behold nought more divine, or more splendid :
2 easily would it surpass Pytho.
Wherefore, I wot, also in his madness insolent Lygdamis threatened to de­ spoil it, and brought against it an army of mare-milking Cim­ merians,3 like-to-the sea-sands in number;
who, 'tis said, dwell near to the strait itself of the heifer, daughter of Ina- chug.
Ah !
wretched amongst kings,4 how vastly he erred :
for he was not destined to return back again to Scythia, either himself, or any other of the many, whose waggons stood in the plain of Cayster,l for in defence of Ephesus ever thy bows and arrows are prepared.
O Lady Munychia, watching-over-barbours,2 hail, Pheræan goddess.
Let none contemn Artemis:
for neither to Æneus,3 having lightly esteemed her altar, did noble contentions come home.
Nor let any one dare to contend with her in stag- hunting or shooting ;
for not even did the son of Atreus ex­ ult in a slight requital.
Nor let any dare to woo the virgin ;
for neither Otus, nor Oarion 4 gained by the wooing a goodly union.
Nor let any shun her yearly choir.
Not even did Hippo without sorrow refuse to dance around the altar.
Hail, mighty queen, and kindly receive my strain.
AT what time or when, 0 my soul, wilt thou sing of the Holy Delos, Apollo's nurse ?
Verily all the Cyclades, which lie in the sea the holiest of isles, are well-worthy-to-be-sung:
but Delos must bear-off from the Muses the first honours, be­ cause she washed and swathed Phœbus,1 king of minstrelsy, and first celebrated him as a god.
As the Muses hate the bard, who shall not have sung of Pimplea, so Phœbus, whosoever shall have been neglectful of Delos.
Now unto Delos will I give-a-share2 in song, that so Cynthian Apollo may love me, as caring for his dear nurse.
Now she, breezy and barren, as lashed-by-the sea,3 and overrun by divers4 rather than by horses, is set in the deep:
which rolling vastly around her, throws-off-upon her5 the white spray of the Icarian wave;
wherefore also sea-sailing fishermen have made her their abode.
Yet none grudge her 6 being named among the first, when the isles are gathered to Ocean and Titanian Tethys, and ever she is first and leads the way.
But close-in-her-track follows Phoenician Cyrnus,1 not-to-be despised, and Eubœan Macris of the Ellopians, and lovely Sardo, and the isle to which Venus swam first from the waves:
and she preserves it in requital for her landing.
2
With well-fenced towers they are strong-and-safe, but Delos with Apollo.
What is a more firm rampart ?
3
Walls indeed and stones might fall under the violent-blast of Strymonian Boreas, but the god is ever undisturbed.
0 dear Delos, such is the helper who protects thee !
4
Yet since exceeding-many hymns revolve around thee, in what song shall I inweave thee ?
What will be grateful to thee to hear ?
Shall it be, how at-the-first the mighty god striking mountains with three-barbed trident, which the Telchines5 wrought for him, made the isles in-the-seas ?
and from below from the lowest depths removed them all as with a lever, and rolled them into the sea ?
and firmly fixed from their foundations some indeed in the deep, that so they might forget the main-land :
whilst constraint did not press thee, but thou floatedst free in the seas, and thine olden name was Asterie,2 because that, fleeing from an union with Jove, from heaven like a star thou leapedst into a deep trench.
So long as indeed golden La­ tona had not yet frequented thee, so long thou wast still Asterie, and wert not as yet called Delos.
Oft-times sailors coming from Trcezen,3 the city of Xanthus, to Ephyra within the Saronic gulf, beheld thee;
and on going back from Ephyra, they indeed saw thee again no more :
for thou hadst sped to the rapid strait of narrow Euripus,4 flowing with a-booming sound.
And on the same day spurning the flood of the sea of Chalets thou hadst swum even to Sunium, a headland of the Athenians, or Chios, or the bosom5 of the isle Parthenia moistened by the wave, (for it was not yet Samos,) where the nymphs of Mycale, neighbours of Ancæus,1 entertained-thee- hospitably.
But when to Apollo thou affordedst a natal soil, the sea- roaming mariners gave thee this name in requital, because that no longer didst thou float obscure upon the deep, but hadst set the roots of thy feet in the waves of the Ægean Sea.
2
Nor didst thou dread Juno in her wrath, who indeed was wont to be terribly angry at all women-in-childbed, who brought forth sons to Jove:
3 and with Latona specially, be­ cause she alone was about to bear a son to Zeus more dear than Mars.
Wherefore also, I wot, she both kept watch within the heaven, being greatly wroth and beyond-the-power of-words;
and was hindering Latona distressed by her throes,4 for two watchers had been set in watch over her, keeping- jealous-eyes upon the earth.
One, namely impetuous Mars, sitting on a lofty peak of Thracian Hæmus,5 was watching in arms the surface of the main-land, whilst his horses meanwhile were being stalled in the seven-recessed cave of Boreas:
but the other, the daughter of Thaumas, sat as spy of the broad isles, 1 having hastily sped to Mimas.
Then they sate threatening the cities, as many as Latona strove-to-reach, and kept prevent­ ing them from receiving her.
Arcady was shrinking, Parthenius, holy mountain of Auge, was shrinking,2 and shrinking back was the olden Phenæus.
Shrank too all Peloponnese, as much as is bordering on the Isthmus, save Ægialus and Argosy for she had not trodden those paths, since Juno had had Inachus allotted to her.
And in one and the same course Aonia was shrinking:
whilst Dirce and Strophie4 were following, holding the hand of dark-pebbled father Ismenus.
Far behind fol­ lowed Asopus tardy-of-limb, for he had been stricken by light­ ning.
(But the nymph, Native Melia,1 dizzy-with-fear ceased from the choir, and paled her cheek, in anxiety-for the coeval oak, when she saw the foliage of Helicon shaken-violently.
Tell me, my goddesses, Muses, is it very truth that oaks were born at the same time as Nymphs.
Glad are the Nymphs, when rain nourishes the oaks;
and when the oaks no more have leaves, then in turn the Nymphs bewail.)
But with them indeed, though yet in-the-womb, Apollo was fiercely wroth, and spake in his threats against Thebes a word not un­ fulfilled :
"
Thebe, wherefore, wretched as thou art, dost thou inquire thy present fate ?
2
Do not yet, do not force me to prophesy against-my-will.
Not yet is the tripod's seat at Pytho a care to me, nor yet hath died the huge serpent,3 but still that monster with dreadful jaws creeping down from Plistus enwreaths snowy Parnassus with nine coils.
1
Yet nevertheless I will say something more clear, than if it were from the laurel:
fly far:
yet will I overtake thee quickly, to bathe my bow and arrows in blood;
for thou hast had allotted to thee the children of a blasphemous woman.
2
Not thou at least, nor Cithæron, shall be own nurse to me.
Being pure, may I also be dear to the pure-and-holy.
3
So spake he, and Latona, turning back again, retired.
But when the Achaian cities rejected her on her coming, Helice,4 friend of Neptune, and Bura, the ox-stall of Dexame­ nus, son of AEneus, then began she to turn her steps back to Thessaly.
But Anaurus fled, and great Larissa, and the heights of Chiron.5
Peneus too shunned her, as he rolled through Tempe.
0 Juno, in thee then a ruthless heart lay even at that time.
Neither wast thou moved or hadst pity, when stretching out both arms in-vain she spake thus:
" Ye Nymphs of Thessaly, children of the River,1 bid your sire soothe his vast flood;
cling to his beard, and supplicate, that I may bear children of Jove in the waters.
Ptbiotian Peneus, wherefore now viest thou with the winds ?
0 father, thou bestrides!
not surely a horse running-for-a-prize.
2
Are thy feet ever, I pray, thus swift ?
Or in my case are they alone fleet ?
and hast thou caused thyself to fly to day only, on a sudden ?
But he hears not!
0 burden mine, whither do I bear you ?
for my wretched tendons flag.
0 Pelion, bride- chamber of Philyra,3 nay, do thou stay !
stay, for even wild lionesses often in thy mountains have cast-forth-with-labour the savage fruit of their throes."
But even Peneus, I-wot, answered her, as he poured forth tears. " 0 Latona,
Neces­ sity is a mighty goddess,4 for I do not, 0 Lady, reject thy pangs :
I know that other women also in child-bed have been cleansed by me.
But Juno has threatened me immoderately.
5
Behold from far what a watcher keeps a look-out from the topmost part of the mountain, who would with-ease tear me out from the lowest depths.
What plan shall I adopt ?
Is it any pleasure to you that Peneus should perish ?
Let it come !
For thy sake I will endure the day of fate, 1 even though I should be destined to be ruined for ever, having the ebbing channel of my stream dried-up, and be called alone most con­ temptible among rivers.
Lo, here I am !
what more need I say ! do but invoke Ilythyia."2 He spake, and forced-back his vast flood.
But Mars having lifted the uprooted peaks of Pangæum3 was about to hurl them into his tide, and to bury his floods beneath them.
Then from on high he rattled, and struck his shield with the point of his spear.
So it clanged with a warlike sound.
Trembled the mountains of Ossa, the Cranonian plain,4 and the stormy edges of Pindus:
the whole of Thessaly danced with fear, for such a sound wrung from his shield.
And as when all the recesses of Mount Ætna smoking with fire are convulsed as the giant beneath- the-earth, Briareus, moves himself to the other shoulder,5 and the furnaces bellow under Vulcan's fire-tongs, and the works at the same time ;
and terribly resound the fire-wrought ewers, and tripods, falling one upon the other :
even such then was the rattling of the circular shield.
Yet Peneus did not give way again, but was abiding firm even as at the first, and stayed his swift currents, until the daughter of Cæus1 cried, " Save thyself, and farewell!
save thyself !
do not thou for my sake suffer ill, in requital for this compassion:
nay, thou shalt have a return of thy kindness."
She spake, and after she had laboured much before, approach­ ed the isles of-the-sea;
but they did not receive her, when she came towards them, no, not the Echinades having a port convenient2 for ships, nor Corcyra which is most hospitable3 of all the rest;
for Iris from lofty Mimas being wroth with them all, kept driving them far, far away:
while they, whom­ soever Latona chanced to reach, by reason of her clamour were fleeing-in-alarm, all together, up and down the waves.
4
Then came she to ancient Cos,5 the island of Merops, the sacred retreat of the heroine Chalciope.
But this word of her son checked her:
" Nay, mother, do not thou bring me forth here;
neither, in truth, do I blame, nor bear ill-will to, the island ;
for it is both fruitful, and abounding in pasture, if any other isle is.
1
But to it from the Fates some other god is due, of the high race of Saviours :
2 beneath whose diadem shall come both continents not unwilling to be ruled by a Macedonian, and the isles which are set in the sea, even as far as the East, and the quarter whence his swift steeds bear the Sun.
And he shall be wise in the manners and habits of his sire.
3
At some future time, too, at last shall come to us a common struggle, whensoever, having raised up the barbarian sword and Celtic warfare against the Greeks, the giants of-a-later- brood4 shall rush-on from the farthest West, like unto snows, or equal-in-number to stars, when they pasture thickest in the air.
1
Then fortresses and villages of Locrians, the Delphic heights, and plains of Crissa and valleys of the continent, would mourn all-around:
and behold the rich fruits of the neighbour­ ing soil, as it burns;
and no longer only by hearsay, but at length with clear gaze would they behold around the temple the phalanxes of foes:
and at length, close to my tripods, swords and impious belts,2 and hostile shields, which shall cause to the Gauls, a senseless crowd, an evil retreat:
part of which shall be my prize, but part on the Nile, having seen their wearers expiring amidst fire, shall-be-laid-up3 to be the rewards of a king who-hath-toiled-much;
which oracles, 0 Ptolemy, I make clear to thee !
Greatly beyond doubt wilt thou approve the seer, that is yet in the womb, hereafter all thy days 4 but do thou, mother, understand thus.
Conspicuous in the water is one slight island roaming amidst the open- seas, and its feet are never in one place, but it floats on tho water's ebb and flow, like an asphodel-stalk,5 whither south wind, or east, or the sea may bear it.
Thither bear me.
For to that isle you will come, willing to receive you.
"The other isles of the sea, as he spake thus much, began to flee away, but thou, song-loving Asteria, descendedst from Euboea, to visit the round Cyclades, not by any means long before :
for still behind thee clung the sea-weed of Geræstus,1 and thou stayedst in the midst of them;
and, pitying Latona, didst burn all the sea-weed, since thou wert exceeding-vexed at heart2 to see the wretched mother weighed down by her pangs :
"
Juno, do with me what thou wilt:
for I regard not thy threats ;
cross, cross over to me, 0 Latona !"
Thou spakest:
and she ineffably ceased from her vexatious wan­ dering,3 and sat beside the stream of Inopus, which the earth then sends forth at its greatest depth, when Nile descends from Ethiopian steep with swollen flood ;
4 then loosed she her girdle, and leaned back with her shoulders against the trunk of a palm-tree,5 worn as she was by grievous distress, and damp sweats were flowing over her skin.
Then spake she, in her weakness, " Why, child, do you bear down your mother ?
this, dear one, is thine island floating on the sea.
Be born, my child, be born,6 and gently come forth from the womb.
"But thou, hard-hearted wife of Jove, wast not likely, 1 ween, long to be without hearing of this:
such a messengei was she that ran to thee, and said, while yet she panted, and her speech was mingled with fear :
" 0 honoured Juno, far foremost of goddesses, thine am I, all things are thine :
and thou sittest own queen of Olympus,l and we fear none other female rule ;
-thou, sovereign, shalt know the causer of thy wrath.
Latona, know you, looseth her girdle in an island, all the rest utterly rejected and would not receive her, but Asterie bath by name invited her as she approached ;
Asterie, base refuse of the deep.
2
Thou, even thou, knowest her.
But, dear mistress, for thou hast power, help,3 awful goddess, thy serv­ ants, who tread the earth's surface at thy bidding."
So spake she, and then sate beneath the golden throne, like a hound of Artemis, which, what time it shall cease from the swift chase, sits, hunting dog as sIte is, beside her steps, and her ears4 are all-erect, ever ready to catch the cheer of the goddess.
Such-like did Iris, daughter of Thaumas, sit beneath the throne.
Now she never forgets her station there, not even when sleep shall rest his wing in-forgetfulness,5 but having bent her head a little toward the projection of the great throne, sleeps there slant-wise.
Never does she unloose her cincture, nor her fleet hunting-shoes, 1 for fear that her mistress should speak some sudden mandate.
Then Juno, being grievously wrathful, thus addressed her :
"
Thus then, ye disgraces to Jove, ye would be wooed by stealth,2 and bear children secretly, and that not where wretched female-serv­ ants-at-the-mill 3 labour in hard child-birth, but where sea- calves breed amid the barren rocks.
But with Asterie for this error I am no-wise wroth ;
nor is there reason wherefore I should treat her harshly, as it were right, (for very wrongly hath she accorded the favour to Latona,)4 but I honour her in a wonderful degree, for that she has not pressed my bed, and has preferred Ocean to Jove."
So spake she, and swans, 5 tuneful minstrels of the god, having left Mæonian Pactolus 6 circled seven times around Delos, and chaunted over Latona in childbirth, birds of the Muses as they are, most tuneful of winged fowl.
Hence afterward the boy fitted to the lyre just so many strings1 as the times the swans had chaunted over her throes.
Not yet an eighth time did they sing, for he leapt forth;
and then to far distance the Nymphs of Delos, stock of an ancient river, sang the holy song of Ilithyia, and forthwith æther's brazen vault gave back the thrilling chaunt.
2 Nor was Juno wroth, for Jove had removed her wrath.
Gold­ en then became all thy foundations, Delos, and of-gold flowed thy circular lake all-its-days;
3 with golden foliage bloomed likewise the olive shoot, and the deep-rolling Inopus was over­ flowing with gold.
Then thou tookest the boy, thyself, from the golden soil, placedst him in thy bosom,4 and spakest thus:
" 0 mighty earth, with-many-an-altar, many-a-city,5 thou that bearest much, ye fertile lands, and ye isles, that dwell around, I am myself barren as ye see me, yet from me shall Apollo be called Delian, nor shall any other land be so much beloved by other god ;
not Cerchnis1 by Poseidon, lord of Lechæum, nor the mountain of Cyllene by Hermes, nor Crete by Jove, as I by Apollo ;
2 neither shall I be any more roaming.
"So spakest thou.
He drew the sweet teat.
Thence, nurse of Apollo, art thou called from that day forth even holiest of isles, nor doth Enyo, nor Hades, nor the steeds of Mars tread thee ;
3 but ever every year to thee are sent tithes and first- fruits,4 and all cities, which have placed their settlements eastward,5 and westward, and toward the south, lead up choirs to thee;
and they who have their dwellings beyond the northern shore, a very ancient stocky
Who however first of all offer to thee wheat straw, and holy sheaves of ears of corn, which the Pelasgi from Dodona receive far-earliest, as they come out from a far land, the Pelasgi sleeping-on-the-earth,1 servants of the vase that is never silent.
Next come they to the holy city, and mountains of the Melian land ;
2 and thence they sail across to the fruitful Lelantian soil of the Abantes :
nor is the passage any longer far from Eubœa :
since thine harbours are neighbouring.
These to thee from the yellow Arimaspians, Upis, and Loxo, and Ecaerge3 of-happy-days, daughters of Boreas, were the first to bring, with the males, who at that time were best among the youths :
neither did these last come back home :
but they were made blessed, and never are they without the meed of glory.
For in truth the Delian women, when the tuneful nuptial-song scares the wonted-haunts4 of maidens, to the virgins offer as first-fruits their coeval locks, whilst the youths bring as their first-fruit the first harvest of their downy chin.
Thee, fragrant Asterie, the islands circle around and about, and as it were encompass thee with a choir, while thou art neither silent nor without-vocal-sounds ;
1 but Hesper with- his-crisp-locks ever looks down on thee celebrated-by-song.
Some sing-to-the-dancing the hymn of the Lycian old man, which Olen, the seer, brought thee from Xanthus ;
2 whilst others, maidens, in-the-choral-dance, beat with their foot the firm earth.
Then truly also is the sacred image far-high re­ nowned of ancient Cypris weighed down with garlands, whom Theseus of old set up,3 when he was sailing from Crete, along with the youths, who, when they had escaped the savage bel­ lowing of Pasiphae's brute son, and the intricate seat of the winding labyrinth,4 danced a cyclic measure around thine altar, 0 revered goddess, whilst the harping roused the dance;
and Theseus led the choir.
Thence the sons of Cecrops send to Phoebus the ever-living rites of the sacred-ship,5 the tackle of that vessel.
O
Asterie of many altars, many suppliants, what sailor, trading in the Ægean, passeth thee by in his fleet ship ?
No gales so strong breathe on his bark, 1 no urgency speeds his sailing with utmost haste, to prevent him:
but quick-they furl the sails, and do not go back again before that they have whirled round thine altar lacerated with stripes,2 and have bitten the holy trunk of the olive, with their hands tied behind them ;
which the Delian nymph invented as sports and food- for-laughter to the young Apollo.
0 hearth of isles,3 of-happy- home, hail to thyself:
and hail Apollo too, and she whom Latona bare.
As the basket1 descends, ye women, join in acclamation :
all hail, Demeter, that-feedest-many, of many-measures.
2
The basket as it descends (close the door of your lips, ye profane) gaze upon, neither from the house-roof, nor from an eminence, neither boy, nor woman, nor she who has suffered her hair to flow unbound,3 neither when fasting we spit from parched mouths.
Hesperus is wont to behold it when he comes forth from the clouds, Hesperus, who alone persuaded Demeter to drink, when she was following after the undiscovered track of her ravished child.
Lady goddess, how did thy feet sus­ tain to bear thee both to the west, and even to the black (Africans), and to where are the golden apples.
Thou didst not drink, no, nor eat nor wash thyself during that time.
Thrice didst thou cross in truth silver-eddying Achelous,5 and as many times pass-over each of the ever-flowing rivers, and thrice didst thou run to Henna, the navel of a most beau­ teous isle,1 and thrice didst thou seat thyself on the ground beside the spring Callichorus, athirst and without drinking ;
and thou didst not eat nor wash thyself.
Nay, let us not speak of these things, which brought tears to Ceres :
better, how she gave to cities pleasing laws ;
2 better, how she was the first to cut off wheat straw and handfuls of ears,3 and in­ troduced oxen to tread out the corn, when Triptolemus was being taught a good art.
4 Better, to see how (that so every one may escape transgressions) she made the son of Triopas pitiable by hunger.
5
Not yet were the Pelasgians inhabiting the Cnidian land, but as yet sacred Dotium;
but to thyself had raised a beautiful enclosure, thickly-grown with trees;
scarce would an arrow have penetrated it.
In it was the pine, in it tall elms, and pear-trees also, and beautiful sweet-apples, whilst the water, like as amber, was bursting forth from springs,1 and the goddess was as fond of the spot as Eleusis, and as Triopus,2 and Enna.
But when their propitious deity was wroth with the Triopidæ, then worse counsel took hold of Erysichthon.
He hastened forth with twenty servants, all in their prime, all giant-men, (they would be sufficient to lift a whole city,)3 having armed them in both respects with hat­ chets and axes.
So they rushed without-shame into the grove of Ceres.
Now there was a poplar, a large tree, reaching to heaven,4 and under it the Nymphs were-wont-to-disport-themselves in the noontide ;
which stricken first, sounded an evil melody for the rest.
Demeter became-aware that her sacred grove is in trouble, and said in her anger, " Who is hewing down my beautiful trees ?
"Forthwith she likened herself to Nicippe,5 whom the state had appointed as her public priestess, and she grasped in her hand the fillets, and poppies, and kept her key on her shoulders.
Then said she, soothing the bad and shameless man, " My son, who fellest the trees which are consecrated 1 to gods, stay, my son, child much-loved by thy parents, forbear:
and turn away thy servants, lest anywise our Lady Demeter be wroth with thee, Demeter, whose holy precinct thou art pillaging.
"At her then looking-askance more fiercely than a lioness with-savage-brood (whose eye men say is of all most terrible) eyes a man on the Tmarian2 mountains, he said, " Give way, lest I fasten this great axe in thy flesh.
These trees thou shalt behold my well-roofed house,3 wherein I shall ever and anon hold pleasant banquets to my heart's content" with my companions.
So spake the youth, and Nemesis recorded the wicked speech.
4
Demeter was wrath in an unspeakable degree ;
and she became the goddess.
Her steps indeed trod the ground, but her head touched Olympus.
1
Then were they half-dead I wot, when they had seen the awful goddess, and on a sudden rushed away, having left the axe among the oaks.
The rest she let alone, (for by constraint they followed beneath their lord's hand,) but she replied to the king that-vexed-her, " So, so build thy hall, thou dog, thou dog,2 wherein thou mayest hold banquets :
for frequent festivals shalt thou have here­ after."
Thus much she spake, and proceeded to work evil fer Erysichthon.
Forthwith upon him she sent a grievous fierce hunger, burning3 and violent;
and he began to be famished by a severe disease.
Wretched man that he was, as much as he happened to eat, for so much more again did a craving seize him.
Twenty were wont to make ready his banquet, twelve to pour out wine :
for so many acts incense Dionysus as in- cense Demeter likewise.
1
For along with Demeter Dionysus had been enraged.
Neither to clubs nor to social banquets could his parents send him for shame, but every pretext was devised to excuse hint.
The Ormenidæ had come to invite him to the games in-honour-of Itonian Minerva :
2 his mother then said that he could not come. "
He is not within, for yesterday he has gone to Cranon, to demand back a debt3 of a hundred oxen."
Polyxo, Actorion's mother, came, for she was making ready her son's nuptials, inviting both Triopas and his son.
But with grieving heart the woman answered, as-she-shed- tears, " Triopas will come at your bidding, but a boar hath smitten Erysichthon in the sweet glades of Pindus,4 and he is lying ill now for nine days."
Wretched mother, fond of thy son, what falsehood then didst thou not utter !
Was any one preparing feasts?
5 Erysichthon was abroad.
Was one marrying a wife ? "
A quoit has struck Erysichthon, or- he has fallen from his chariot, or he is numbering the flocks on Othrys."
But within-the-inner-chambers, then for-whole- days-long the feaster was devouring ten-thousand viands of every kind, 1 but his insatiate stomach was-in-commotion while he kept eating more continually:
and all the meats kept flowing down idly thankless, as it were into the deep of the sea.
Even as snow on Mimas, as a wax-doll in the sun,2 and yet more than these he was wasting, until on the nerves of the wretched man fibres and bones alone were left.
3
Weep­ ing was his mother, deeply wailing were his two sisters, and the nurse by whom he was suckled,4 and the ten handmaids oftentimes.
Yea, and often would Triopas himself lay hands on his hoary hair, thus calling on Neptune, who did not heed him ;
" 0 falsely named father, behold this the third from thee, that is, if I indeed am son of thee and Æolian Canace ;
5 and from me is born this wretched offspring.
"
For would that mine hands had duly buried him stricken by Apollo :
6 but now baneful famine is seated in his eyes.
Either remove thou from him his sore disorder, or thyself take and maintain him:
for my tables have fallen-short.
Reft are my folds, and my stalls now void of beasts:
and at length my cooks have declined the task.
Nay more, they have un yoked the mules from the great wains, and he ate the heifer which his mother was feeding for Vesta, 1 and the prize- gaining steed and war-horse, and the cat, which lesser animals dread.
2
As long as matters rested in the house of Triopas, so long the household apartments, I wot, alone were aware of the mis­ fortune.
But when his teeth were beginning to consume- arid-exhaust the plenteously-supplied house,3 then it was that the king's son sate in the cross-roads, begging for morsels, and cast-away refuse of feasts.
0 Demeter, may he be no friend to me who is hated by you, neither may he be under- a-common-roof :
4 evil-neighbours are hateful to me.
Sing, ye virgins, and, ye mothers, join the acclaim:
all-hail, Deme­ ter, many-nurturing, of-many-measures.
And as the four white-maned steeds carry the basket,1 so shall the great god­ dess, wide-ruling, come bringing to us fair spring,2 fair sum­ mer, winter, and autumn, and shall keep them for us to another year.
And as without sandals,3 and without fillets, we tread the city, so shall we have our feet, and our heads, all-unharmed.
As the basket-bearers4 carry baskets full of gold, so we shall possess gold in abundance.
'Tis meet that the uninitiated women should attend these mysteries as far as the Prytaneum of the city:
5 whosoever are under sixty years, as far as the goddess's temple;
but those who are weighed down by age, and she who stretches out hands to Ilithyia,6 and whoso is in pain, 'tis enough that they follow as far as their knees are able:
and to them Ceres will give everything in full-abundance, and that they may come to her temple.
Hail goddess, and preserve this city in harmony, and in prosperity ;
1 and bring all things home ripe from the fields.
Feed our cattle:
support our fruit-trees:
bring forth the ear, produce the harvest:
nurse also peace, that he who has sowed, that same may reap.
2
Be propitious at my bidding, 0 thou thrice-prayed for, widely-ruling among goddesses.
As many of you as pour-water-for-the-bath of Pallas,4 come forth, maidens all, come forth.
Already have I heard the sacred steeds neighing;
and the goddess moves-on ready- equipped:
:
1 haste then, hasten, ye auburn-haired Pelasgian maids.
Never has Minerva bathed her divine arms before that she has dispersed the dust from the flanks of her coursers:
not even, I say, when she came carrying all her armour be­ spattered with gore from the impious giants.
2
But, far before all else, she loosed from the chariot her horses' necks, and pathed in the springs of Ocean3 the drops of sweat:
and from their bit-champing 4 mouths cleansed all the foam that had clotted there.0 come forth, Achæan nymphs, and bring not unguents, nor caskets;
(I hear the sound of the wheels under the axles:
5) bring not unguents, ye bath-preparers, nor caskets for Pallas, for Minerva loves not mixed ointments, no, nor mirror.
Her eye is ever beautiful:
not even when the Phrygian was de- ciding the strife at Ida 1 did the Great Goddess gaze either into the prepared-brass, or the transparent eddies of Simois :
2 neither did Juno:
but Venus, having taken up a radiant brass-mirror, ofttimes twice altered-the-position of the same lock:
while Pallas having driven-over one hundred and twenty double courses, like the Lacedæmonian stars beside the Euro­ tas,3 skilfully took and bruised smooth ointments, products of her own tree.
Ye maidens, but the blushes rushed-up, with hue such as the morning rose or pomegranate's kernel has.
4
Wherefore now also bring ye only the strong oil, in which Castor, in which also Hercules, anoints himself.
Bring out too her comb all-of-gold, that she may comb her hair when she has anointed her sleek curl.
Come forth, Minerva :
a welcome troop is present to thee, the maidens, daughters of the great Acestoridæ.
5 0 Athena, there is carried also Diomed's shield, 1 since this is the elder custom of the Argives, which Eumedes, a priest acceptable to thee, instituted:
who of yore, when he had learned that the people was making ready death decreed against him, fled away with thy sacred image, and went and dwelt in the Mount Creon :
the Mount Creon,2 and placed thee, 0 goddess, on the broken rocks, of which the name is now Pallatides.
Come forth, Athena, city-sacking, golden-helmed,3 delighting in the noise of steeds and shields.
To-day, ye water-carriers, dip not your vessels, to-day Argos drinks from springs, and not from the rivers.
To-day, ye handmaids, bring your urns either to Physadea,4 or to Amymone, daughter of Danaus ;
for truly, having mingled his waters with gold and lowers, Inachus will come from the mountains rich-in pasture,5 bring­ ing for Athena her beauteous bath.
But thou, 0 Pelasgian, beware lest even against thy will thou behold the queen.
Whoso shall have seen Pallas, the city's-guardian, naked, this Argos shall behold him now for the last time.
10 Lady Minerva, come thou forth:
and meanwhile I will utter something to these maidens.
Yet the speech is not mine, but that of others.
2
Ye daughters, in Thebes of old, Athena loved one Nymph exceeding-well, yea and beyond the rest, the mother of Tiresias,3 and never was she without her, but both when she was driving her steeds toward the ancient Thespieans, or toward Coronea, where was her in­ cense-perfumed grove, and where her altars lay on the river Curalius,4 or toward Coroner, or to Haliartus, crossing over the cultivated lands of the Bœotians;
ofttimes the goddess made her to mount her own chariot.
Neither were the sweet converse of the Nymphs, nor the choral dances pleasant to her,5 where Chariclo did not lead them.
Yet still even her many tears were awaiting, though she was the favourite com­ panion to Athena.
For once-on-a-time, having unloosed the clasps of their robes, they twain were bathing in fair-flowing Heliconian Hippocrene :
6 and noon-tide calm was holding the mountain.
They both were bathing, and 'twas the hour of noon;
and much stillness was pervading that spot.
But Tiresias still alone with his dogs, with his chin just now darkening, 1 was roaming up and down the holy spot:
and thirsting unspeakably 2 he came to a stream of the fountain, wretched youth that he was, and without wishing it beheld what was not lawful for him to see.
Then wroth though she was nevertheless Athena addressed him, " What deity, 0 son of Everus, hath led thee, that shalt never more bear hence thine eye-sight on an evil journey?"
She spake, and night fell-upon the eyes of the youth.
3
Speechless he stood, for sorrows glued his knees, and helplessness withheld his voice.
But the Nymph shrieked out, " What, awful goddess, hast thou done to my son ?
Are ye goddesses 4 friends such as this ?
Thou hast taken away the eyesight of my son.
0 accursed child, thou sawest the bosom and limbs of Athena;
but never again wilt thou behold the sun;
ah, wretched me !
0 mountain, 0 Helicon no more to-be-approached by me.
Surely thou hast gained a great triumph instead of a small :
1
Thou hast lost a few antelopes and roes, thou hast gotten the eyes of my boy."
She spake :
and having clasped her dear son round with both arms the mother, deeply weeping, set-up the fate of plaintive njghtingales.
2
Then the goddess pitied her companion, and Athena addressed these words to her.
" 0 noble woman, reverse again all things as many as you have spoken through anger:
for not I indeed made thy son blind :
3 for 'tis not pleasant to Athena to steal the eyes of boys ;
but thus the laws of Cronus decree,-That whoso shall have beheld any of the immortals, when the divinity himself shall not choose, this same should behold with a heavy penalty.
4 0 noble lady, this act cannot be again recalled, since thus the threads of the fates approved,5 when first you had given birth to him:
now then endure, 0 son of Everus, the debt 1 which is owed to thee.
How many burnt-offerings will the daughter ot Cadmus burn hereafter, and how many Aristæus, praying to behold their only son, the youthful Actaeon, blind, and no­ thing more !
2 He, too, shall be companion-in-the-chase of mighty Artemis :
yet not his running nor his far-dartings in common with her among the mountains shall save him then.
When, though not wishing it,3 he shall have beheld the grace­ ful bath of the goddess:
but then the very hounds shall ban­ quet on their former lord.
And his mother shall gather the bones of her son,4 going through all.
the glades.
She will say that thou hast been most fortunate and of happy-days, since thou, 0 my companion, hast received thy son blind only from the mountains:
wherefore do not wail at all:
for this man many other privileges await at my hands for thy sake.
5
For I will make him a prophet to-be-sung-of by posterity, in a degree of-a-truth far exceeding the rest.
And he shall un­ derstand birds,6 which is favourable and which fly in vain, and of what sort the flight is unfavourable.
Many oracles shall he utter to the Boeotians, many to Cadmus, and in after time to the mighty descendants-of-Labdacus.
1
I will give him, too, a great staff,2 which shall guide his feet serviceably, and I will give him a far-distant end of his life.
He alone, after death, shall go to and fro among the shades, being wise-and- prudent, held in honour by the great Pluto."
3
Thus having said, she bowed to confirm her words;
and that is ratified, to which Pallas has bowed assent:
since to Athena alone of his daughters has Jove granted this, to en­ joy all her sire's attributes.
4
Ye attendants of the bath, no mother bare the goddess, but Jove's head;
and that is con­ firmed to which Jove's head shall have assented :
5 in like man­ ner that to which his daughter shall have done so.
Now as­ suredly comes Athena.6
But do ye, 0 maidens, as many as care for Argos, welcome the goddess, both with good omens, and with prayers, and with acclamations.
Hail, goddess, and care for Inachian Argos.
Hail also when thou art about to drive forth, and again drive thy steeds to the city, and guard- safely all the inheritance 7 of Danaus.
A STRANG ER1 from Atarneus inquired thus of Pittacus the Mitylenæan, the son of Hyrrhadius. “
Aged sire,2 a double union invites me :
the one bride in truth is my match both in wealth and birth ;
but the other is my superior :
which is best ?
Come now, counsel me,3 which am I to lead to Hymen ? ”
So said he:
but the other, having lifted his staff, an old man's instrument, spake thus:
“ Lo, these will tell thee the whole word (for the boys I wot, engaged with tops swift under the influence of strokes, were spinning them in the broad cross-road).
4 Go," said he, “ in the track of these."
He then presented himself near:
the boys were saying, " Spin the one that is suited to you.
”5 Hearing these words, the stranger forbore to win the greater family, and took heed to the omen of the boys.
As he then led home to his house 7 the lowly bride, so do thou, 0 Dion, marry the one that is suited to you.
1ONE told of your fate, Heraclitus,2 and brought me to tears;

But there still live thy strains,4 on which Hades, spoiler of all,5 shall not lay his hand.

A MUSSEL-SHELL was I of yore, 0 Zephyritis,2 but thou, Venus, possesses!
me now, a first present of Selenæa, the nautilus 3 who was wont to sail on the seas, spreading a sail, if there were winds, from mine own forecables ;
4 but if there were a calm, bright goddess,5 ably rowing with my feet:
my name corresponds with the act.
6
But I was cast up on the shores of Iulis,7 that so I might become thy precious toy, Arsinoe ;
8 and that not any longer for me in her nests as aforetime, (for I am lifeless,) should the egg of the rain-loving Halcyon be hatched.

OF-A-SHORT nature, 0 Dionysus, is the speech for the poet when successful:
1 the longest word2 he says is " I'm victor."
But should any one ask him, on whom thou shalt not have breathed propitiously, “ What luck ? ” 3 he says, " the result was hard."
Be such words his, who meditates injustice;
4 but be mine, 0 king, that lucky brevity.

OF old I was a priestess of Demeter, and again of the Ca­ biri,3 0 man, and afterwards of Dindymene4 I became the old priestess, (who now am dust,) in-authority over many young women.
5
And to me two male children were born, and in their arms I closed-mine-eyes6 in-happy-old-age.7
Go on thy way rejoicing.
THAT which still breathes, is but half my life ;
2 but the other half I know not whether Eros or Orcus bath snatched - away ;
but gone-it-is.
I wonder if it bath gone again to one of the youths ?
And yet I often bade them not, saying, Re­ ceive3 not the fugitive, young ones.
Is it not even gone to Cephisus,4 for I know that that death-deserving and passion­ ately-loving maiden attaches-herself somewhere there.
IF indeed, 0 Archinus, I have wilfully gone a-rioting, blame me ten-thousand times :
but if I am come against-my-will, consider my hastiness.
5
Strong-drink and love compelled me,6 of which, one of them kept dragging me, the other would not let me keep a sober mind.
But when I had conic, I marked not who or whose, but I kissed the neck :
1 if this is a wrong deed, I am a wrong-doer.
THE stranger was wounded without our knowledge :
thou sawest how sad a breath he drew through his breast.
Lo, he was drinking the third time,2 and the roses shedding their leaves were poured all on the ground from the man's chaplet.
3
Doubtless he has been seriously inflamed ;
no, by the gods, I do not guess without reason,4 but being a thief, I have learnt the traces of a thief.
5THERE is, yes by Pan, something hidden, there is, by Bac­ chus, some fire beneath these ashes.
6
I have no confidence :
prythee embrace me not.
Ofttimes a river, though it be silent, eats imperceptibly through the wall.
7
Wherefore now too I fear, Menexenus, lest this stealthy-gilder,8 insinuating himself, should throw me into love.
WHEN I beheld the beautiful Archestratus, I said that he was not beautiful, no, by Hermes, for he did not seem exceedingly so.
I spake, Nemesis2 seized me, and straightway I lay in the flames:
Jove was wholly directing his lightnings against me.
3
Shall I propitiate the boy, or the goddess ?
Nay, the boy is more precious to me than the goddess.
Good bye to Nemesis.
THOU wilt be caught, roving Menecrates,4 said I on the twentieth of July, and of August-on the-what ?-the tenth day the ox came of-his-own-will under the plough.
5 Bravo, bravo, my Mercury !
I do not find-fault along-of the twenty days.
6WHILST Polyphemus found his incantation good, so long7 the Cyclops neglected his sheep, and counted them not.
The Muses, Philippus, waste love away.
Surely wisdom is a medicine healing all.
1
This good, methinks, even famine has, and only this, in addition to its ills.
It cuts off the disorder of love.
Yes, and I have even both in abundance against love.
This, boy, little boy, clips thy wings.
Not even the least crumb 2 do I fear thee ;
for both the charms against the severe wound are at my home.
OFTEN truly in the choruses of the tribe Acamantis the Dionysiac hours shouted loud on account of the ivy-bearing dithyrambs, and with chaplets and choicest roses overshadow­ ed the sleek locks of skilful poets, who dedicated this tripod as their witness of Bacchic prizes ;
those men Antigenes in­ structed.
But well did Ariston, the Argive, nurse a sweet voice, pouring into simple Doric pipes a tuneful breath:
of whose honey-voiced choir Struthon's son, Hipponicus, was leader, borne in the chariots of the Graces.
Who gave him famous name and splendid victory among men, by-the-power- of the Muses, goddesses with violet wreaths.
THIS salt-cellar, from which eating plain salt,5 he had escaped great storms of debt, Eudemus dedicated to the Sa­ mothracian gods, saying that he had this set up here accord­ ing to his vow, ye peoples, because he had been saved from the brine.
FOR quickness-in-learning, Simus, son of Miccus, prayed, presenting me to the Muses.
And they, like Glaucus,l gave a great gift instead of a small.
But I am set over against this double letter of the Samian,2 gaping, I the tragic Bac­ chus, as hearer of boys.
3
While they say, Holy is the lock, telling me my daily dream.
TELL, stranger, that I, Pamphilus,4 am set up 5 as a wit­ ness, truly comic, of the victory of Agoranax the Rhodian, and not burnt by love.
1
But half of me is seen like to a dried fig and the lanterns of Isis.2
Miccus used to take care of Phrygian Æschra, a good nurse4 even in her lifetime with all comforts, and, when she was dead, set up her statue, for posterity to see, how the old woman receives-in-full 5 the thanks for her breasts.
THE Graces are four.
For in addition to those famous three one more has been fashioned at some recent period, and is still moist with unguents.
Blessed in all things is very- enviable Berenice, without whom not even the Graces them­ selves are Graces.
THE beautifully7 swarthy Theocritus, if indeed he hates me, you would hate four times as much:
if he loves me, you would love him.
Yea !
by fair-tressed Ganymede, 0 hea­ venly Jove, thou too wast once in love.
8
I will not speak more at length.
COME even again, Ilithyia, at the invocation of Lycænis, 1 helping her thus in childbirth with easy-deliverance from throes.
So shall it be to thee now, 0 queen, for a girl:
but for a boy, hereafter thy fragrant temple will hold somewhat else.
THOU knowest2 that thou hast, O Æsculapius, the debt which Aceson vowed3 and owed for his wife Demodice.
But should it escape thee, and thou demand payment, the tablet declares that she will preserve her chastity..
CALLISTIUM, daughter of Critias, dedicated me, a lamp rich with twenty lamp-nozzles, to the god of Canopus,4 having vowed me for his son Apellis.
But looking upon my lights you will say, " Hesperus, how hast thou fallen.
"EVENETUS, who set me-up, says (for I know nought of it) that I am suspended 5 in requital for his private victory, a brazen cock to the Tyndaridæ.
I trust the son of distinguish­ ed6 Philoxenides.
IN the temple of Inachian Isis,7 Æschylis, daughter of Thales, placed me up, by the promise of her mother Irene.
WHAT stranger art thou, shipwrecked mariner ?
Leonti­ chus found me here a corse on the shores, and buried me in this tomb, whilst he wept for his own fateful life:
for not even doth he spend a quiet1 life, but traverses the seas, like divers.
BLEST was Argive2 Orestes, because, though mad in other respects, he was not afflicted with the madness of men mad- with-love.
3
Nor did he make the trial of the Phocian,4 which tests his friend, but exhibited even one drama alone.
Sure quickly would he have lost even his friend, had he done this:
and I no longer have many Pyladæ.
ALL ye, who journey past the sepulchre of Cimon of Elis,5 know that ye pass the son of Hippæus.
ALAS, alas !1 for thou too art thus, Menecrates !
Thou wast Dot for long.
What bath made an end of thee, 0 beat of hosts.
Why surely what2 killed the Centaur :
which came to me as my fated slumber, but the wretched wine forms the pretext.
THE race of Neptune and of Jove trained their youth in contests of sturdy wrestling.
3
And their contest is proposed not for a brazen ewer, but who shall carry away life or death.
The fall was that of Antaeus :
but 'tis fitting that Jove's son, Hercules, should conquer.
Wrestling is peculiar to Argives, not Libyans.
THOU there, that seekest to burn even fire itself,4 that de- sirest to light up by night thy beautiful lamp, come hither and kindle a flame from my soul.
For within me burning,5 it sends forth a vast blaze.
BRAVEST of beasts am I,1 of mortals he, whom I now guard, as I stand on this stone tomb.
But unless Leon had had the heart, I wot, as he had the name of lion, I would not have set my feet on this tomb.
THE three-years-old Astyanax while sporting round about a well, a mute image of a form drew in to itself.
3
And from the water the mother snatched her drenched boy, examining whether he had any portion of life.
But the infant did not defile the Nymphs, for, hushed on the lap of his mother, he sleeps his deep sleep.
WORN out with age and poverty, and no man outstretching a contribution for misfortune, I have come into my tomb by degrees with my trembling limbs.
With difficulty have I found the goal of a troublous life.
And in my case the custom of the dead hath been changed.
For I did not die first, and then was buried;
but was buried, and then died.
5THE old woman Nico crowned the sepulchre of the maiden Melite.
0 Orcus, hast thou decided this aright ?
WHEREFORE, 0 Venus, unable-to-endure battle-dins, hast thou had Mars assigned to thee ?
Who was the coiner-of-the falsehood ?
Foolishly did he fasten-on-thee hateful arms ?
For to thee loves are delightful, and the joys of the couch,1 and the women-maddening sounds of castanets.
But to divine Tritonis 2 leave these bloody spears :
and go thou to beautiful- tressed Hymen.
Wild beasts of Cynthus,3 be of good-courage.
For the bow and arrows of Cretan Echemmas are laid up in Ortygia with Artemis, the arrows wherewith he desolates the vast moun­ tain :
but now he has ceased, ye she-goats, since the goddess has effected a truce with kiln.
So mayest thou sleep, Conopium, as thou makest me to serenade at this cold vestibule.
So mayest thou sleep, most wicked one, as thou puttest thy lover to sleep :
and thou hast chanced upon pity not even in a dreamt Neighbours pity :
but thou not even in a dream:
but thy gray hair will soon remind thee of all these things.
BID me not hail, bad heart, but pass on.
Thy-not-laughing is equal joy to me.
O KING, son of Latona, child of Jove, never shall I forget thee, beginning nor ending.'
But ever first and last and in the middle will I sing thee.
Hear thou me, and grant me blessings.
King Phœbus, when the goddess, august Latona, having grasped with her hands the taper palm,3 bare thee most beau­ teous of immortals at the circular lake,4 boundless Delos was all filled with ambrosial odour, and5 the vast earth smiled, whilst the deep wide-waters of the gray brine rejoiced.
6
Beast-slaying Artemis, daughter of Jove, whose statue Agamemnon set up,7 when in swift-ships he was sailing to Troy, hear me at-my-prayer, and avert from me evil fates.
Little to thee, 0 goddess, this, but much to me.
1Muses and Graces, daughters of Jove,2 who of old went to the nuptials of Cadmus, and sang a noble strain:
" what is beautiful, is dear, and that which is not beautiful, is not dear."
3
Through immortal mouths this word bath come.
Cyrnus,4 let a seal be set on these words of mine, as I pur­ sue wisdom, but it will never escape notice, if it be stolen.
5
Nor will any one take-in-exchange worse, when the good is present:
but thus shall every one say, these are the poems of Theognis,6 the Megarean, and one celebrated among all men:
yet not yet am I able to please all the citizens.
No wonder, son of Polypas, for not even doth Jove please all, either when he rains, or when he holds up.
7
But to thee with kind inten.
tion I will give advice, Cyrnus, even such as I myself learned, when yet a boy, from the good.
1
Be wise, and do not on condition of shameful or unjust acts draw to thyself honours, nor distinctions, nor wealth.
These things know thus :
and consort not with bad men, but ever cleave to the good :
with them eat and drink, sit with them, and please them, of whom there is a large force.
For from the good thou shalt learn good,2 but with the bad if-thou shouldst mix, thou wilt lose even the mind thou hast.
Learn this, associate with the good, and sometime thou wilt say, that I give good advice to my friends.
Cyrnus,3 this city is pregnant:
but I fear that it will bring- forth a man to be a chastiser of our evil violence.
For the citi­ zens here on their part are as yet sober-minded:
but the leaders, have turned themselves so as to fall into much worthlessness.
No city yet, Cyrnus, have good men ruined ;
4 but when it pleases the bad to be insolent, and they corrupt the commons, and give judgments in favour of the unjust,5 for the sake of private gains and power, expect that that city will not long be kept tranquil,6 even though now it is settled in much calm, when these gains shall have become dear to the igno­ ble men, coming along with public hurt.
For from these is sedition, and civil bloodshed of men, and to a state such as this a monarch would never be pleasing.
Cyrnus, this state is still a state indeed:
1 but its people truly are other, who aforetime knew nor rights nor laws, but were wont to wear-out goat-skins about their sides, and to inhabit this city, like stags, without the walls.
2
And now, son of Polypas, they are noble:
but they who were bettermost of yore, now are of-low-degree:
who can endure to look on3 these things ?
They deceive also one another, laughing one at the other, conscious of the sentiments neither of bad nor good.
Son of Polypas, get none of these citizens as a friend, with thine whole heart,4 for the sake of any advantage:
but seem indeed to be friend to all in tongue, yet associate with none of them in any serious matter at all.
For you will learn the minds of wretched men, that in their deeds there is no reliance.
5
But they have loved tricks, and deceits, and crafts in suchwise, as men no longer in-a-sound-condition.
6
Never, Cyrnus, trustingly consult with a mean man, when you may wish to accomplish a serious matter:
but go to a man-of-worth, and take advice, after you have made great efforts, and accomplished, Cyrnus, a long journey afoot.
Not even to all friends communicate wholly 1 a matter:
few, look you, of many have a trusty mind.
Rely on but few men when you take in hand great deeds, lest ever, Cyrnus, you find incurable sorrow.
A faithful man is worthy to-be-prized-equally with gold and silvery 0 Cyrnus, in vexatious doubt.
Few men, son of Poly pas, will you find, as comrades, proving themselves faith­ ful in difficult circumstances, who would have the courage, possessing a like-minded spirit, to share alike good fortunes and bad.
3
And of these you will not find, by seeking even among all men, such a number in all as one ship would not carry :
4 upon whose tongue as well as eyes a-sense-of-shame is set, nor does gain lead them to a base dealing.
Do not caress me in words, and keep your mind and heart elsewhere, 1 if you love me and if there dwells in you a faith­ ful mind.
Either love me, cherishing a sincere mind, or dis­ own and hate me, having raised a quarrel openly.
2
But he who, with one tongue, has yet his mind at variance, this man, Cyrnus, is a formidable comrade, better as a too than when a friend.
If a man shall praise you for so long as he sees you,3 but, when removed elsewhere, launches forth an evil tongue,4 such a comrade, look you, is not by any means a very good friend, who would say what is most acceptable with his tongue, but thinks differently.
But be such an one my friend, who, knowing his comrade, even if he be troublesome in disposi­ tion,5 bears him as a brother.
Do you, I pray, my friend, ponder these things in your mind, and at some time hereafter you will remember me.
Let no man persuade thee, Cyrnus, to love a bad man.
6
For what benefit is that man, if he be a friend ?
Neither would he rescue you from severe trouble and loss, nor when he has what is good, would he be willing to share this.
'Tis the vainest thanks to one that does good to them- of-low-degree,1 all one with sowing the wide-waters of the gray brine.
2
Since neither if you sow the waters-wide, would you reap a thick crop, nor benefiting the mean, would you be requited in turn with benefit.
For the mean have an in­ satiate mind :
if you shall have erred in one thing, spilt is the love arising from all the ancient kindnesses.
3
But the noble in the highest degree receive and enjoy benefits, and retain memory of good deeds, and gratitude in aftertime.
4
Never make the mean man friend and comrade,6 but ever fly from him as a bad harbour.
Many, look you, are com­ panions in drinking and eating,6 but fewer in a serious mat­ ter.
And nought is harder to discern than a friend of-base- olloy,7 0 Cyrnus, or of more value than caution.
The loss of alloyed gold or silver is to-be-borne,1 and it is easy for a shrewd man to detect:
but if the mind of a friend within his breast is untrue without-your-knowledge, and he has a treach­ erous heart within him, this is the falsest thing that God hath made for loan, this the most distressing of all to discern.
For you cannot know man's mind nor woman's,2 before you have proved it, like as of a beast-of-burden.
Nor could you guess it, as if at any time you had gone to a ware exposed for sale,3 for oftentimes appearances4 deceive the judgment.
Pray, son-of-Polypas, to be foremost neither in dignity nor wealth :
5 but only let there be luck to a man.
Nought among men is better than a father and mother, to whom holy justice is a care.
6
No one, Cyrnus, is himself the cause of loss and gain :
but of both these the gods are givers.
Nor doth any man toil, knowing within his heart as touch- log the issue, whether 'tis well or ill.
1
For oftentimes think­ ing that he will bring about evil, he is wont to bring about good, ay, and thinking to cause good, he causes ill.
Neither to any man do as many things as he may wish arrive :
for the bounds of stern impossibility hinder them.
But we men entertain vain thoughts, knowing nothing.
2
The gods accom­ plish all things after their own mind.
None ever, son of Polypas, having deceived a guest or a suppliant among mortals, has escaped the eye of the im­ mortals.
3
Choose also rather to live religiously with small means,4 than to be rich, having gotten riches unjustly.
In justice is all virtue collectively, yea, and every man, Cyrnus, if just, is good.
Wealth indeed fortune gives even to a man wholly bad,5 but excellence attends few men, 0 Cyrnus.
Insolence,1 0 Cyrnus, the god is wont to present as the first evil to the man, whom he is about to hold in no esteem.
Ful­ ness, look you, breeds insolence,2 whensoever wealth attends a mean man, and one whose mind is not sound.
Do not ever, having become enraged at a man, 0 Cyrnus, throw-in-his-teeth3 heart-breaking poverty, or base want-of- means.
For Jove, look you, inclines the scale now to one, and now to another, so that one while they should be rich, and at another time have nothing.
4
Never speak in public, Cyrnus, big words;
for no man knows what a night and day bring about for a man.
5
Many, I wot, enjoy a mean mind, but a noble fortune :
to whom that which seems ill turns out good.
There are, too, who toil with both good counsel and ill luck, but accom­ plishment does not follow their works.
6No man is either wealthy or poor, mean or noble, without the help of the gods.
7
One man has one ill, another another ;
but in strict truth, no one of men whom the sun looks upon is blest.
1
But whom the gods honour, even he who finds fault, commends, though there is no regard for a man,Pray to the gods, whose is great might ;
nought happens to man without the gods, either good things or bad.
3
Poverty most of all things breaks down a noble man,4 more even, 0 Cyrnus, than hoary age and hot-ague.
And it in truth he ought to flee, and to cast it even into the deep, deep sea,5 and down steep rocks.
For every man subdued by poverty can neither say nor do anything, but his tongue is bound.
One ought then, Cyrnus, to seek alike over earth and the broad back of the sea for a riddance from hard poverty.
6
To die, dear Cyrnus, is better for a poor man than to live worn down by hard poverty.
7
We seek for well-bred rams, asses, and horses,8 Cyrnus, and every one wishes that those from a noble breed should cover.
1
But a well-born man cares not to marry a mean woman, a mean man's daughter, if he give her much wealth.
No woman refuses to be wife of a mean man if he be rich, but prefers that he be wealthy2 instead of noble.
'Tis wealth they value;
noble man weds mean man's daughter, and mean man the daughter of the noble.
Wealth is wont to mix the breed.
Then marvel not, son of Polypas, that the race of citizens is obscured,3 for noble is mixed with base.
The man-of-rank weds the woman-without-fame, he him­ self, look you, leads her home, though he knows that she is base-born, because he is induced by her riches ;
for stern necessity urges him on,4 which also makes a man's mind wretched.
But to whatsoever man riches shall have come from Jove,5 and by just means, and with clean hands, they remain ever stedfastly.
Though if a man unjustly shall acquire beyond what-is-proper with covetous spirit, or by an oath, having taken beyond what is just, at the moment he seems to bear off some gain, but in the end again there is ill, for the mind of the gods is wont to be superior.
6
But these things deceive the mind of men ;
for not at the very time of the acts do the immortals take vengeance on errors.;
But one man in his own person is wont to pay a bitter debt, another attaches ruin hereafter to his own chil­ dren.
1
And another justice does not catch ;
for unscrupulous death was beforehand sitting on his eyelids,2 bringing fate.
To an exile, believe me, none is a friend and faithful com­ rade,3 and this is more vexatious than banishment itself.
Verily, to drink much wine is bad,4 but if a man drink it prudently, 'tis not bad but good.
Cyrnus, direct a various habit towards all your friends,5 mingling with your own the temper which each has.
Get thee the temper of the polypus,6 with-tangled-twisting-arms, which on any rock to which he has attached himself appears such as it is to look upon.
Now follow this way, now be­ come different in complexion ;
the wisdom of versatility is something of a rapid kind.
7
Be not too indignant when citizens are in a state of disturbance, 0 Cyrnus ;
but go on the middle path, as I do.
Whoso, look you, thinks that his neighbour knows nothing, but that he himself alone possesses intricate counsels, he, I wot, is senseless, reft of sound mind:
1 for we all are Be- quainted equally with crafty counsels.
But one chooses not to follow filthy lucre, whilst to another faithless wile-weav- ings are more agreeable.
2Now no limit of wealth has been made-clear to men,3 for they who of us now have most substance, strive after twice as much.
Who could satisfy all?
Riches verily to mortals become folly.
.
And from it up-starts ruin, which when Jove shall send upon them worn-and-weary, one at one time and another at another possesses.
Though he be citadel and tower to an empty-minded populace,5 Cyrnus, the noble man gets little share of praise.
Nor longer, I wot, becomes it us, as men in a state of safety, to destroy, as it were, the walls of a city about to be taken.
6
To thee indeed I have given wings, wherewith thou wilt fly1 over boundless deep, and all earth, easily borne-aloft;
and thou wilt be present at all banquets and feasts, resting in the mouths of many;
2 thee too with sweet-voiced pipes young men gracefully lovely shall sing well and tunefully ;
and whensoe'er thou comest to the much-lamenting homes of Hades, beneath earth's murky vaults, never more, even though dead, shalt thou lose thy renown, nor,3 I ween, escape notice, having ever imperishable fame among men, 0 Cyrnus, whilst thou tarriest in the land of Greece, or up and down the isles, crossing over the fishy barren deep, and not seated on the backs of horses ;
but the tasteful gifts of violet-wreathed5 Muses will convey thee, for with all, to whom, even among posterity, minstrelsy is a care, thou wilt be likewise, as long as there shall be earth and sun.
I, however, meet with small reverence from thee, but with words thou deceivest me, as a little child.
1
That which is most just is most noble ;
health most preferable ;
but the gaining the object of one's love is the most pleasant thing.
2I am as it were a well-bred racing mare,3 but I carry a very mean man :
and this to me is most vexatious.
Often ere now have I been ready to burst the bridle and flee, hav­ ing thrust from me my mean charioteer.
Wine is not drunk by me,4 since with a tender maiden, an­ other man, far meaner than I, has the upper hand.
Cold water to my sorrow her dear parents drink with her, so that she at the same time fetches water and bears me groaningly.
Then having clasped the damsel round, I kissed her neck, and she spoke tenderly with her lips.
Known, look you, is poverty, even though it be strange, for it neither comes to the market nor the law-suits.
For everywhere it has the lesser share, and everywhere 'tis mock­ ed :
1 everywhere also, wheresoever it may be, it is equally hostile.
Equally, in truth, to mortal men the gods have given the other things,2 to wit, wretched old age and youth.
But 'tis the worst of all the evils among men, and more unlucky than death and all diseases, after that you have reared children, and afforded them all things suitable, and laid up money for them, having experienced much trouble, if they hate their father,3 and pray that he may perish, and abhor him as if he were a beggar coming to them.
It is likely that a mean man would ill respect the rules of justice, since he stands-in-awe-of no divine-vengeance here­ after.
4
For a worthless mortal may take up many impracti­ cable things at the moment, and deem that he arranges all well.
Relying on none of the citizens, advance one step,5 trusting neither oath nor covenant, not even if a man, wishing to give pledges, chooses 1 to give Jove, the supreme king of im­ mortals, as his surety.
For verily in a city so malignantly- blaming as this, nothing pleases, and according as any one does, so they are called far the more senseless.
2
But now the ills of the well-born are good things to the mean of men, and be­ come a law to the devious.
For a sense-of-shame hath perished :
impudence and insolence, having mastered justice, possess the whole earth.
Neither does a lion always feast on flesh :
but him, strong though he be, yet nevertheless perplexity seizes.
3
To a babbling man silence is the hardest burden, but an unlearned man, if he speak, is so to all in whose presence he may be.
All hate him :
yet the mixing up of such a man in a banquet is necessary.
Nor does he wish to be a friend, when ill has chanced to a man,4 even though he may have been born of one and the same womb.
Be bitter and sweet, harsh and kind,5 to hired servants and slaves and neighbours near- your-doors.
It is not meet often-to-change6 a good life, but to keep peace:
and to alter the ill life, until you have brought it right.
The mean are not wholly mean from the womb, but through having cemented a friendship with mean men.
1
And they have learned worthless works, and slanderous words, and in­ solence, supposing that all was true which those men said.
Among companions-at-a-meal,2 be a prudent man ;
and deem that all escapes his notice, as if absent.
Know how to endure jokes, and be brave out-of-doors, understanding what temper each has.
Among the mad indeed I am exceeding mad ;
3 but among the just I am of all men most just.
Many mean men are rich, look you ;
and noble men are poor, yet with these we will not exchange their wealth for our excellence:
:
4 for the latter is ever secure, but riches now one and now another of men possesses.
Cyrnus, a noble man bath a judgment always firm, and is bold when set amidst blessings and amidst ills.
But if the god shall present to a mean man substance and wealth, in-his- folly be is unable to contain his meanness.
6
Do not ever on a slight pretext ruin a man7 that is a friend, trusting, Cyrnus, to a harsh slander.
If a man in every instance should be wrath at the faults of his friends, never would men be in-concord or in-friendship one with the other.
For faults follow-after mortal men,1 Cyrnus :
but the gods choose not to endure them.
Even the slow man with-good-counsel hath caught the swift man in the pursuit, Cyrnus, with the aid of the straight­ forward justice of the immortal gods.
2
Quietly, as I do, pursue the middle way with thy feet,3 nor give to one party the property of the other, 0 Cyrnus.
Never, Cyrnus, kindly-treat an exile on the ground of hope,4 for not even, if he has returned home, does he become any more the same.
Make-too-much haste in nothing, the mean is best of all:
5 and thus, Cyrnus, thou shalt have excellence, which too it is hard to get.
May
Jove grant me both requital of my friends, who love me,6 and that I may be more powerful than my foes.
And so should I have the character of being a god among men, if the fate of death should overtake me, when I had recompensed them.
But, 0 Jove, accomplish me, thou Olympian god, a seasonable prayer, grant me to experience in return for ills some good also.
But oh might I die, 1 unless I find some cessation from evil cares, and if thou givest but sorrows in return for sorrows.
For thus is my lot;
and there does not appear to me a means of vengeance on the men who perforce have plundered and possess my property;
but like a dog2 I have crossed a mountain-torrent, having shaken off every­ thing in the rain-swollen stream.
Whose black blood may it be mine to drink :
3 and oh might the good Genius aid me, who would accomplish these things to my mind.
O worthless poverty, why tarriest thou, failing to go 4 to an­ other man ?
and why, prithee, dost love me, not desiring it ?
Nay, go, and visit another house, nor along with us be ever sharing this wretched life.
Be of good courage, Cyrnus, in ills, for amid blessings too thou wast wont to rejoice,5 when the lot fell to thee to have a share of these too.
And even as thou hast received ill out of blessings, even so also, praying to the gods, try to emerge again.
Neither display it too much :
1 for when exhibit­ ing any ill, 0 Cyrnus, you have but few carers for your ca­ lamity.
The heart of a man, look you, 0 Cyrnus, having suffered great loss, is weakened ;
2 but when he takes vengeance, after­ wards it is increased.
Beguile your enemy with good words:
3 but when he shall have come into your power, take vengeance on him, having admitted of no excuse.
Restrain thy mind,4 and let mildness ever attend thy tongue :
the heart, look you, of mean men is more sharp than is meet.
I cannot understand the mind of the citizens, 5 which they entertain :
for neither if I do them good, nor ill, do I please them:
and many blame me, alike the base-born and the well- born :
but none of the unwise can imitate me.
Do not, goading me perforce,6 and against my will, drive me under the waggon's yoke, drawing me, Cyrnus, too much into friendship.
Kind Jove, I marvel at thee, for thou rulest over all,1 having honour thyself and vast power.
Well knowest thou the mind of men, and the spirit of each ;
and thy might, 0 king, is highest of all.
How is it then, 0 son of Saturn, that thy purpose has-the-heart to hold men that are sinners, and the just man, in the same portion,2 both if thy mind shall have been turned towards moderation, and if towards the inso­ lence of men yielding to unjust deeds ?
Neither is anything defined by the deity for mortals, nor the way in which walk­ ing a man may please the immortals.
But nevertheless they hold wealth harmless ;
while they who keep their mind aloof from worthless deeds, still are-wont-to-find the mother of poverty, want-of-means,4 though they love what is just;
want-of-means, which leads on the spirit of men to error, hurting their minds within their bosoms by strong necessity.
So a man has-the-courage, though he wishes it not, to bear many disgraces,5 yielding to want, which truly teaches many lessons, to wit, falsehoods, deceits, and mischievous strifes, to a man even against his will :
6 and they seem to him no evil, for it also breeds vexatious lack-of-means.
But in poverty both the mean man, and he who is far better-born are seen,1 whensoever, I mean, want takes-hold-on-them.
For the spirit of the former indulges in unjust thoughts, no, nor even is a right sentiment ever inherent in his breast:
but the mind of the latter on-the -contrary follows neither bad nor goodfortunes:
it is right however that the bettermost man should have the courage to meet both the one and the other.
2
Respect your friends,3 and flee oaths that-ruin-men:
but avoid, and give-heed-to, the wrath of immortals.
Make too much haste in nothing :
in all the works of man the-fitting-season 4 is best:
often a man, seeking gain, is hastening towards rank-and-honours, whom fortune readily draws astray into a great sin, and is wont to make him deem without difficulty that what is really evil, that is good;
but that what is good-and-useful, that is bad.
5
Most dear though thou art, thou hast erred ;
and I, look you, am nowise to blame, but thou thyself hast chanced on sentiments not good.
No treasure wilt thou lay up for thy children better than a sense-of-shame, which also, Cyrnus, attends good men.
Of no man, whom judgment and whom power attends,6 0 Cyrnus, seem thou to be a worse companion.
But when I drink, I am not about to become so drunk,.
nor does wine lead me on, so far as to speak a harsh word respect­ ing you.
None like me can I find, when I seek a trusty associate,2 in whom there is no guile.
But when I have come to the touch-stone I am rubbed beside baser metal, as gold beside lead, and a mind of superiority 3 is in me.
Many things pass me by, even though I am conscious of them:
but of necessity I am silent,4 knowing our power.
To many men well-fitting doors are not set on their tongue,5 and many things are a care to them, which should be uncared for.
For oft that which is bad is better, if stored-up within, and good, having come abroad, is better than what is bad.
6
Of all things indeed to men on-the earth, not to be born,7 and not to see the rays of the piercing sun, is best:
but that when born he should, as soon as possible, cross the gates of Hades, and lie low, having heaped together for himself much earthyTo beget and nurture a child is easier than to implant right feelings :
2 this at all events no one has yet contrived, in mak­ ing the senseless sensible, and the mean noble ;
but if a god had granted this, I wot, to the sons of Æsculapius,3 to cure meanness, and the infatuated minds of men, many and great wages would they earn.
And if mind were capable-of-being created and implanted in man, 4 never would worthless son have been born of worthy father, but he would have been heedful of prudent discourses.
5
But by teaching you will never make the mean man noble.
He is a fool, who has my mind indeed in safe-keeping, but pays no attention6 to his own proper mind.
No one, look you, is in all things blest, but the nobler man has the heart 1to endure what is evil, and still is not known- to-all.
But the baser man neither in woe nor weal knows how to remain in possession of spirit:
the gifts of the gods come variously to mortals;
yet it is right to have the courage to hold the gifts of the immortals,2 such as they give.
If you choose to drench me, undefiled water shall flow ever clear from the top of my head:
and you shall find me in all deeds like-as refined gold,2 ruddy to look-on, when rubbed by touch-stone;
the colour of which from above the dark rust doth not touch, nor mould, but it has its brilliancy4 always pure.0 man, hadst thou obtained a share of j udgment, even as thou hast of folly, and hadst thou been sensible as thou art senseless, to many of these citizens thou wouldst appear an- object-of-envy, just as now thou art nothing-worth.
5A young woman, look you, is not an expedient thing for an old man :
6 for she, like a light boat, does not heed the rudder, nor do anchors hold her:
but, having burst her fasten­ ings, oft in the nights she hath another harbour.
Never set thy mind at least on things impracticable,1 nor long for wealth, of which there is no accomplishment.
Easily, look you, the gods have given wealth, neither any- thing mean, nor noble:
but there is glory attendant on a dif­ ficult work.
Practise yourself about virtue:
and let what is just be dear to you, nor let gain, when it is base, get the upper hand of you.
3
Force no one of these against his will to remain with us, 4 nor bid any, if he wishes it not, go out of doors.
Nor rouse in-his-sleep, Simonides, whomsoever of us, drunken with wine, soft sleep shall have seized.
5
Neither bid him that is watchful, sleep against his will, for every-thing-done-by- compulsion is vexatious.
6
And to him that chooses to drink let one stand near and pour-out-wine:
not every night does it happen to us to live delicately.
Now I, for I have due measure7 of sweet wine, will go home, and be mindful of care-relaxing sleep;
and I will show that wine is most pleas­ ant for a man to drink, for neither am I a whit sober, nor yet am I very drunk.
Now whoso exceeds the due measure of drinking, that man is no longer master of his tongue or mind:
but he speaks scandalous words,2 which, to the sober, seem disgraceful, and nothing is he ashamed to do, whenso­ ever he may be drunk.
Though be were sensible before, then he is a fool:
do you, then, knowing these things, not drink wine in excess;
but either, before you are intoxicated, rise and go, 3 lest your stomach constrain you, like a worthless hireling for-the-day;
or be present, and do not drink:
but you, though knowing these things, are ever babbling this fool­ ish word, " pour-in :
" therefore, look you, you are drunk.
For one cup is taken " to friendship;
" another is pledged:
4 this you offer as a libation to the gods:
the fourth you hold in your hand.
And you know not how to say nay ;
5 now, look you, that man will be invincible, who, though he drink many cups, shall say nothing silly.
But do ye discourse well, tarry­ ing beside the bowl, long keeping-off contentions one from the other;
speaking fairly and evenly alike to one and with all, and thus a banquet becomes not unpleasant.
Wine belongs to the senseless man as well as the sensible.
When, however, it is drunk above measure, it is wont to render the mind light.
1
In fire, indeed, skilful men try gold and silvery but wine is wont to show the mind of a man, even though he be ex­ ceeding sensible;
wine which when drinking he is wont to praise beyond measure, so as to disgrace one being even wise aforetime.
My head, Onomacritus, is heavy-with-wine,3 and wine does violence to me, but I am no longer master of my senses;
nay, the chamber whirls-round.
Come, let me rise and try whe­ ther perchance the wine bath my feet too,4 and my mind with­ in my breast.
I fear lest, in my drunkenness, I should do anything foolish, and incur a great disgrace.
Much wine drunk is bad:
5 but if a man drink it with- judgment, 'tis not bad but good.
So thou hast come, Clearistus, after having accomplished a passage across the deep sea,6 hither, wretched man, a beggar to a beggar.
Under the ship's sides, truly, we will place benches, Clearistus,1 such as we have, and as the gods give us:
and we will supply the best of what we have:
but should any one come, being a friend of thine, say to him, " Sit-at- meat, an' thou lovest me."
I will neither set apart aught of my substance, nor, for the sake of entertaining thee, will we bring aught more from other quarters.
Then should any inquire my means of subsistence,2 thus tell him, that I live with diffi­ culty as regards living well, but very well for one living with difficulty:
so as not to fail even one guest of my father's, though I am not able to afford feasts to more men.
Not to no purpose, Plutus, do mortals honour thee most, for of-a-truth thou bearest distress with ease.
3
For verily it is fitting for the bettermost to have wealth indeed, but pover­ ty is proper for a mean man to bear.
Alas me for youth and wretched old age, the latter coming on, and the former departing.
I have betrayed neither any friend nor trusty comrade, nor is there aught servile in my spirit.
Ever is my heart cheered,4 whensoever I shall have heard the delightsome sound of vocal flutes.
And I rejoice in drink­ ing well, and in listing to a flute-player;
I delight, too, in carrying the gay lyre in my hands.
Never is a slave's head erect, but always crooked, and has the neck askance.
5
For neither from the squill do roses or hyacinths spring, no, nor ever from a bond-woman a free- spirited childNo man, dear Cyrnus, forges fetters for himself unless the gods beguile my judgment.
I fear, 0 son of Polypas, lest insolence, even the insolence which destroyed the savage Centaurs, should ruin this stated'
Tis right that I, 0 Cyrnus, should adjudicate this cause by rule and square,3 and deal fair play to both sides, namely, to oracular birds, and to burnt sacrifices, that so I may not in­ cur the foul disgrace of error.
Never do violence to any one through wickedness :
for to the just man nought is better than good-conduct.
4A voiceless messenger stirs up, 0 Cyrnus, war-of-many tears, 5 seen clearly as it is from a conspicuous mountain-peak.
Nay,then, place bridles on your swift-footed steeds, for methinks that they will encounter hostile men :
nor long the way which they will traverse between us and the foe, unless the gods de­ ceive my judgment.
It behoves a man lying in severe griefs to take heart, 1 and to ask deliverance from them at the hands of the immortal gods.
Consider :
the danger, look you, stands on a razor's edge:
2 at one moment you shall have much:
at another far fewer possessions:
so that you neither become exceeding rich in possessions, no, nor thrust yourself into much want-of-means.
Be it mine to have somewhat myself but to bestow the most of the riches of foes on my friends to enjoy.
Now 'tis meet that one should be invited to a banquet, and sit beside a worthy man, versed in all wisdom, so as to un­ derstand him 4 whensoever he shall utter aught-of-wisdom, that so you may be instructed, and go home to your house with this gain.
Delighting myself in youth I sport-and-sing:
5 for, when I have lost my life, I shall lie long beneath the earth, like a voiceless stone;
and shall quit the delightful light of the sun, and, though I be a man-of-worth, yet shall see nothing any more.
Opinion, indeed, is a great evil to men,6 but experience a very excellent thing:
many of the bettermost men have an opinion unproved-by-experience.
Do good, and good shall be done by you :
1 but wherefore send you another messenger ?
the tidings of a benefit is easy.
My friends abandon me, yes, because I avoid my enemy, as pilot avoids the low-rocks2 in-the-sea.
'
Tis easier to make a mean man out of a bettermost man, 3 than a noble man of a base:
teach me not:
I am not of an age to learn.
I hate a mean man :
and I veil myself when I approach him,4 having the volatile spirit of a little bird.
I hate also a roaming woman,5 and a wanton man, who desires to plough the furrow of another.
But the things which have gone by, it is impossible should become undone:
6 the future, however, be that a care to our caution.
Danger, I wot, is attendant on all works, neither knoweth any one,7 when a matter begins, where he is likely to land.
But the man who endeavours to be popular, without fore­ thought, 8 is wont to fall into great and severe ruin.
Him how- ever who doeth well it is the deity that invests with every­ thing, with lucky chances, and riddance from folly.
It is right to endure what the gods give to men, and to bear easily the lot of both classes.
Neither when distressed with ills be vexed at heart, nor be delighted on a sudden with good fortune, before you have seen the extreme end.
1Good Sir, let us be companions one to another at a dis­ tance.
2
There is satiety of everything save wealth.
Long then let us be even friends;
but do thou associate with other men also, who better know thy mind.
You have not escaped-my-notice as you walked along the road, on which even aforetime you used to driver stealing my friendship.
Away with you, hateful to gods, and faithless to men, you who had in your bosom a chilly spotted snake.
Such-like deeds, such insolence, ruined the Magnesians also,4 as now possesses this sacred city.
Fulness hath ere now destroyed far more men,5 look you, than famine, to wit, as many as were desirous of having more than their share.
At the beginning a lie gets small thanks,6 but at last base lucre, in truth, and ill arise, both of them :
nor is there any- thing noble to any man, whom a lie attends, even though it be the first that has gone forth from his mouth.
It is not hard to blame one's neighbour, no, nor to praise him:
these things are a care to mean men.
And mean men do not choose to be silent, prating mischief1 rather, but the noble know how to preserve moderation in all things.
No one of the present race of men doth the sun look down upon, being entirely good and moderate.
Not to any great extent are all things accomplished to men'a liking, for immortals2 are far-superior to mortals.
I am much tost-about in difficulties, being vexed at heart:
for we have not outrun extreme poverty.
Every one honours a -rich man, but dishonours a poor:
3 and in all men there is the same mind.
All-kinds-of-baseness exist among men, and all-kinds-of excellence, and devices for livelihood.
'
Tis hard for a sensible man to speak much among the senseless, and so it is always to be silent:
for this is impos­ sible.
In truth, 'tis disgraceful for a drunken man to be amongst sober men :
4 and disgraceful if a sober man remains among the drunken.
Man's-estate and youth lighten a man's mind,1 and stir up the spirits of many to error.
Whoso hath not a mind that is master of his inclinations, lie, I wot, Cyrnus, lies ever in follies, and in great errors.
Consult twice and thrice on whatever shall have come into your mind,2 for a hasty man, look you, is hurried-to- ruin.
Judgment and sense-of-shame attend men that are good, who now are really few among the many.
Hope and hazard are alike among men:
:
3 for both these are severe deities.
Often beyond both expectation and hope 4 it is given men to discover the works of men, but success is not wont to fol low their counsels.
A single individual, look you, troubles neither one-well- affected, nor his foe,5 unless he meet with a serious matter.
Many are friends and comrades over the bowl,6 but fewer in a serious matter.
Few companions would you find faithful protectors, when you are placed in great perplexity of spirit.
Now at length a sense-of-shame hath perished among man­ kind,1 but shamelessness roams over the earth.
Thou luckless poverty, why, seated on my shoulders,2 dost thou disgrace my body and mind ?
Nay, thou teachest me against my will perforce many disgraceful arts, though I know from men good and noble lessons.
May I be fortunate, and dear to the immortal gods,3 0 Cyrnus ;
then am I eager for no other excellence.
Along with thee, Cyrnus, when thou hast suffered misfor­ tune, we are all distrest:
but of-a-truth grief for another lasts but-for-a-day.
In hard fortunes be not at all excessively disgusted at heart, neither rejoice in prosperity:
for 'tis a noble man's course to bear all things.
Nor is it right to swear this, “that this thing shall never be,"4 for the gods also, in whose hands is the issue, are wroth.
Yet still one ought to do somewhat :
5 both good hath arisen from ill, and ill from good;
ay, and the poor man very quickly becomes rich, while he who has possessed very much on a sudden is wont to lose everything, in fact, in a single night.
And sensible man errs, and glory oft attends a sense.
less man :
honour too even a mean man is wont to obtain.
If I had wealth, Simonides, even such as I was acquainted with,1 I should not be vexed at associating with the noble.
But now they (riches) pass-me-by, though I knew them,2 and I am mute through poverty, though still knowing better than many.
Wherefore we are borne-on now, having pulled down our white sails,3 from the Melian Sea, through murky gloom :
but they do not choose to bale the ship, and the sea sur­ mounts both the vessel's sides, whereby with great difficulty any one saves himself:
yet the sailors are slumbering,4 and have made the pilot, good though he was, cease from his work, the pilot who used to watch over it understandingly.
By force they plunder property, order is upset, and no longer is there an equal distribution in common :
but the porters bear-rule, and the mean are above the noble.
I fear lest haply the waves should ingulf the ship.
5
Let thus much have been wrapt in riddles darkly,1 for the men-of-worth ;
but a man, if he be wise, would be cognizant also of the evil.
Many dunces have riches, but others seek what is noble,2 though harassed by severe poverty:
but impossibility-of- working lies-beside both :
the one class want-of-riches im­ pedes, of-intellect the other.
3
'
Tis impossible for mortals to strive against immortals,4 or to deal out justice.
To none is this permitted.
It is not right to cherish5 what should not be cherished, nor to do what it were better to leave unaccomplished.
With satisfaction mayest thou duly perform thy voyage through the great sea,6 and may Neptune bring thee home, a joy to thy friends.
Many men, look you, being senseless, has fulness ruined, for 'tis hard to understand moderation, when good things are present.
In truth, 0 my spirit, I cannot afford thee all things fit­ ting.
7
Bear up :
for not by any means thou alone art fond of what is beautiful.
When I am flourishing,1 friends are many ;
but should any calamity have chanced upon me, few retain a faithful spirit.
For to the multitude of men there is this virtue only, namely, to be rich :
but of the rest, I wot, there is no use.
2
Not even though you should have the sense of Rhadaman­ thus himself and be more knowing than Sisyphus, son of Æolus;
(even he who by his cunning came-up-again from Hades, after having persuaded Proserpine by wily words, Proserpine, who gives oblivion to mortals, and misleads their mind:
4 and never hath any other devised this, I ween, whom­ soever in truth the black mist of death has enshrouded, and he has come to the chilly place of the dead, and crossed the dark portals 5 which confine the souls of the dead, even though they refuse:
yet, verily, even thence came back the hero Sisy­ phus to the light of the sun through his own exceeding- shrewdness ;
) nor if you could make falsehoods like to truths,6 having the skilful tongue of the god-like Nestor, and were t swifter of foot than the fleet Harpies, and the sons of Boreas, whose feet go swiftly.
Nay, then, 'tis right that all should lay up this maxim, that wealth has the most power among all.
Equally rich, look you, are he to whom there is much silver and gold, and plains of wheat-producing earth, horses and mules;
and he to whom that which is needful is ready, so that he may enjoy himself in pleasures of stomach, sides, and feet;
1 and boys and women:
for when the fitting season of these shall have arrived, and at-the-same-time their youthful prime is suitable, these are wealth to mortals:
for no one goes to Hades with all his immense wealth.
2
Neither by paying ransom can he escape death, or heavy diseases, or wretched old age coming upon him.
O Father Jove, would that it might please the gods, that their insolence should delight sinners;
3 and that this might be agreeable to their mind, namely, that whoso ruthlessly works daring deeds in his heart, nowise standing-in-awe-of the gods, that he, I say, thereafter should atone for his evil deeds;
and that the father's infatuation should not in after- time be a woe to the children.
But that children, who, being born of an unjust sire, know and do justice, reverencing thy wrath, 0 son of Cronus, and from the very first loving the right amongst the citizens, should not pay the penalty for any transgression of their sires.
May these things be agreeable to the blessed gods:
but now he that commits wicked deeds escapes, and another presently suffers the punishment.
Then how, 0 king of immortals, is it just, that whoso is aloof from unrighteous deeds, holding no transgression, nor sinful oath, but being righteous, should suffer what is not just ?
What other mortal, too, I pray, when he looks at this man, would afterwards stand-in-awe-of the gods, and entertaining what feeling ?
When an unrighteous, infatuated man,1 having avoid­ ed the wrath neither of any man nor of the immortals in any­ wise, doeth wrongs, and is glutted with wealth ;
whereas the righteous are wasted, being worn out by severe poverty.
Having learned this, dear comrade, get riches justly, keep­ ing a prudent spirit, afar from blind-folly, and ever remem­ bering these my words ;
2 then at the last you will commend me, giving heed to a wise speech.
May Jove, dwelling in heaven, hold on high3 his right hand ever over this city for its health and safety, as well as the other immortal blessed gods;
but may Apollo nerve my tongue and mind:
and on the other hand let the holy melody sound with lyre,4 and also flute ;
but let us, having made full drink-offerings to the gods, drink and speak pleasantly one with the other, in no wise fearing the war of the Medes.
So be it!
and, better still, be it ours,1 enjoying a cheerful spirit, aloof from cares to pass our days cheerily, and delight our­ selves, and to drive far away2 ill fates, wretched age, and the end of death.
'Tis meet that the Muses' servant and messenger,3 if he know aught special of wisdom, should not begrudge it:
but should seek after some things, point out some, and invent others ;
alone knowing for what purpose he should use them.
O sovereign Phœbus, thou thyself fencedst the citadel4 in favour to Alcathous, son of Pelops;
do thou then ward off from this city the insolent army of Medes,5 that so thy peo­ ple, in cheerfulness, as spring comes on, may send thee splen­ did hecatombs, delighting themselves with lyre, and lovely festival, with choirs of paeans, and shoutings around thine altar.
For of a truth I fear, when I look on the folly and people-destroying seditions6 of the Greeks.
Yet do thou, Phœbus, propitiously guard this our city.
For I have gone aforetime both to the Sicilian land, and I have gone to Eu boea's vine-clad plain,1 and to Sparta, splendid city of reed- nursing Eurotas, and all did with alacrity entreat-me-kindly when I came.
But no pleasure in them came over my spirit;
so much, I wot, is nought else dearer than our father-land.
2
Never may other fresher care present itself to me, in place of charming wisdom;
3 but may I ever, possessing this, de­ light myself with lyre, with dance, and song;
and with these blessings may I have a noble mind.
Harming by baneful deeds neither any stranger nor any of your townsmen, but, being just, delight your own mind:
and of the unfeeling citizens some will speak ill of you, others better.
The noble one man blames much:
another praises:
4 but of the mean there is no record:
but of men unblamed is none upon the earth;
and 'tis best for him, of whom there is no care to the greater number.
No one of men will either be, or hath been, born, who will go down to Hades pleasing to all.
For not even he who reigns over mortals and immortals, Jove, son of Cronus, can please all mortals.
It behoves, indeed, a man that goeth-to-consult-the oracle, Cyrnus,1 to keep more straightly than compasses, line, or rule ;
such a man, I mean, as he to whom the god at Pytho, having given answer to the priestess, shall have indicated a prophecy from his rich sanctuary;
for neither though you add aught would you discover any remedy, nor if you have diminished aught, would you escape the punishment of offence, on the part of the gods.
I have experienced a thing nowise inferior to an unseemly death, but of all other things most vexatious, 0 Cyrnus.
My friends have cast me off:
so I, having drawn near to mine enemies, am about to see also what mind they have.
An ox, stamping on my tongue with sturdy foot,3 restrains me from chattering, though I am versed in it, 0 Cyrnus.
But still it is impossible to escape from what is fated to suffer ;
and what I am fated to suffer I nowise fear to endure.
Into a vast unspeakable evil4 are we come, wherein above all, O Cyrnus, the fate of death may seize us both together.
But they who dishonour their parents, when growing old, for these, Cyrnus, there is no place of esteem..
Neither aid any tyrant in the hopes that 'tis matter of gain.
2 nor slay him, when you have entered into covenants sworn before the gods.
How bath our spirit had the heart to sing to the flute- player ?3 but from the forum is seen the limit of the land, which maintains with her fruits men wearing at feasts and on auburn locks purple garlands.
Nay, come now, Scythian, shave thy hair, and cease from revelling, and lament the fragrant country lost.
By faith have I lost wealth, and by unbelief preserved it:
4 but the counsel of both is difficult.
All this my property is with the crows and in ruin ;
nor is any of the immortal bless­ ed gods to blame in my judgment:
but man's violence, and much gain, and wrong have thrust me out of many good things into poverty.
There are two fates truly of drinking to wretched mortals, 1 limb-relaxing thirst, and baneful drunkenness.
Now between these I shall abide, nor will you persuade me either not to drink at all, or to be excessively drunken.
Wine, indeed, in other respects is agreeable to me, but in one 'tis disagreeable, to tit, when, having made me drunk, it leads me against a foe.
But when one, being properly above,2 shall have been lowered, then 'tis meet he should go home, having ceased from drinking.
To upset a man well established is easy ;
but to set right that which is ill settled, is difficult.
Spurn the empty-spirited rabble,3 strike them with sharp goad, and place around them a galling yoke.
For no more will you find a populace so fond of despots, among all men, as many as the sun looks down upon.
May Olympian
Jove destroy the man who chooses to de­ ceive his comrade, prating smoothly4 to him.
I knew indeed even before, but much better now, that the mean have no gra­ titude.
Oft hath this city through the baseness of its rulers, like a ship wandering out of its course, driven past the land.
But if any of my friends sees me in any trouble, turning his head away, he does not even choose to look on me:
yet if any good comes to me from any quarter, such as often 5 hap­ pen to a man, I find many greetings and friendships.
My friends forsake me, and will not give me aught,1 when men appear:
but I of-my-own-accord go out at-eve, and come-in again at dawn, when the voice of wakening cocks is heard.
2
To many useless men the god gives good wealthy which being nothing, is better neither to itself nor its friends.
But the great glory of martial excellence4 will never perish, for a warrior saves both country and city.
Then may the broad brazen vault-of-heaven fall on me from above, that terror of men of olden-time, if I shall not help them indeed who love me :
but be to my foes a vexation and great source-of-loss.
Wine, I in part commend thee, partly blame:
neither can I wholly either ever hate or love thee.
Good art thou, and bad.
Nay, who would blame thee ?
or who praise thee, if he has due measure of wisdom ?
Drink wine, which to me from the top of Taygetus6 vines have borne, which the old man, beloved by the gods, Theoti­ mus, planted in the mountain glades, introducing cold water from the grove-of-plane-trees.
1
Drinking of which, thou wilt dispel2 harsh cares, and when thou hast well drunk, wilt be far the lighter.
May peace and wealth possess the state, that I may revels with others, for I love not baneful war.
Neither do thou too much lend an ear, when the herald shouts loud and far :
4 for we are not fighting for our father-land.
Yet 'tis disgraceful, when present and mounted on fleet-footed steeds, not to look upon tearful war.
Alas me, for our cowardice!
Cerinthus is undone,5 and the goodly vineyard of Lelantum is stript.
The noble flee :
the mean administer the state:
would Jove might destroy the Cypselizing race !
6Nought better than judgment bath a man in himself, I wot, or more vexatious, Cyrnus, than lack-of-judgment.
Cyrnus, he not in all respects wroth with mortal men, knowing that you have a mind, like as each man has, in your breast, and deeds also.
To mortals, whether the just man, or the unjust, great loss may ensue.
Of each man one act is worse, another better:
but no man is himself wise in all respects.
Whoso watches expenditure,2 hunting after riches, has the most distinguished excellence in the sight of men-of-under­ standing.
For if it were possible to ascertain the end of life,3 to Mit, how much time having accomplished, a man were fated to go to Hades, it would be reasonable that he, who awaited his destiny the longer time, should most spare the substance which he had.
But now 'tis not so:
a circumstance which really rouses great vexation in me, and I an heart-worn, and have my mind in doubt.
So I stand in a cross-road,4 and there are two roads in front for me:
I consider on which of these I am to proceed first:
either being at no expense I waste my life in wretchedness;
or, accomplishing but few works, I live pleas­ antly.
For I, too, have seen a man who was careful, and never would allow his stomach food fit for a free man,5 rich though he was:
yet ere he had finished he descended within Pluto's mansion, and the chance-comer from among men re­ ceived his wealth;
so that he toiled in vain6 and did not give as a man could wish.
Another have I seen, who in­ dulging his appetites squandered his wealth, and said, " I de- light my soul, and then retire:
"' but he begs of all his friends, wheresoever he may have seen one.
Thus, Damocles.
'tis best of all to regulate your expenditure according to your means, and to pay attention to this;
for neither will you then toil first, and give another a share in the fruit of your toil;
nor will you finish your servitude a beggar;
no, nor, should old age come, will all your wealth flee-away:
for in such a class as this 'tis best to have riches:
since if you are rich, you will have many friends ;
2 but should you be poor, then few:
and then no longer is the same man equally good.
'
Tis best to spare:
since not even does any one wail for the dead, unless he sees wealth left behind.
Few among men doth worth and beauty attend:
3 happy he who hath obtained both of these:
all honour him :
the young alike, and his equals-in-age, and his elders give place to him.
I cannot sing tunefully with my voice,4 like a nightingale, for the last night I went to a revel.
Nor do I set up the piper as an excuse;
but a comrade, no wise lacking sense, fails me.
Close to the piper will I sing, standing here on the right, and praying to the immortal gods.
I will walk by rule on the straight path, swerving to neither side:
for 'tis meet I should entertain all right views.
I will distinguish my bright native-city, neither having brought myself under the power of the commonalty,l nor complying with unjust men.
Though having overtaken with my feet, as a lion trusting in his strength,2 a fawn from a stag, yet have I not drunk its blood :
and though I have mounted lofty walls, I have not sacked the city;
though I have yoked my steeds, I have not set foot in my chariot.
I have accomplished and yet not accomplished, succeeded and yet not succeeded, done yet not done, achieved yet not achieved.
There are two evils to him that doth good to the mean man:
he will both be stript3 of his own many possessions, and get no thanks.
If, after having experienced some great good from me, you are not thankful, may you come again a beggar to my house.
While I was drinking alone of the dark-water spring,.
methought the water was of a sweet and limpid nature ;
but now hath it been polluted;
water is mixt with water:
I will drink then of other fountain or river.
Never praise before that you shall have clearly known as to a man, the temper, disposition,5 bent, which he is of.
Many, look you, having a base and wily nature, hide it, having put on themselves a spirit to-last-the-day, but of each of all these time discloses the character:
for I too, I wot, have gone far wide of my judgment, and have been before-hand in praising you, ere I bad thoroughly learned your character:
but now at length, as a ship, I stand far apart.
'
But what excellence is it to drink and carry off the prize- of-wine?
2 oft verily even the worthless man surpasses the worthy.
There is no one of mortals, who, when once earth shall cover him,3 and he shall have descended to Erebus and the abode of Proserpine, delights therein, because he neither hears lyre nor piper, nor lifts to his lips the gifts of Bacchus.
Seeing these things, I shall feel well at heart, so long as un- tremblingly I carry light limbs and head.
4
Be no man friend to me in tongue, but in deed too:
5 and let him be active both with hands and means.
Neither let him delight my spirit with words over cups, but show by acts if he can do aught good.
Let us then stake our dear spirits on festivals, while yet they can bear the delightsome works of enjoyment.
For quickly as thought passes brilliant youth,' neither is the speed of coursers fleeter, even those which impetuously bear a spear- brandishing warrior to the struggle of men, whilst they exult in the wheat-bearing plain.
Drink when men drink:
2 but when thou shalt have been at-all disgusted in spirit, let no man know that thou art troubled.
One while, look you, you will grieve at suffering, and at another, doing, you are able to rejoice, and at different times you are a different man.
Would it was allowed, Academus, that thou shouldst chant a lovely hymn,3 and that a slave in the fair flower of youth might be the prize proposed to thee and me contending on the score of skill-then shouldst thou know how much better are mules than asses.
But when the sun4 indeed just now cheers on his solid- hoofed steeds in æther, holding the middle of the day, then cease we from dinner, to go whither inclination leads every one, gratifying the appetite with all manner of good things;
and let a comely Lacedæmonian5 maiden with slender hands quickly bring out water, and carry in the garlands.
But excellence, this is the noblest prize among men,1 and the most fair for a wise man to bear off;
and this is a common blessing to every city and people, he who with-broad-stride stands fast amid the first ranks.
Now I will counsel men for their-common-good,2 that every one enjoying the bright bloom of youth may also entertain sound thoughts in his heart, to enjoy the good, each of his own possessions:
for twice to grow-young is not given by the gods, neither is there to mortal men an escape from death:
3 but baneful and destructive old age overpowers them, and touches the tops of their heads.
How blest and fortunate and lucky he,4 who hath descended to Hades' dark mansion, without having experienced troubles, before that he has made his enemies cower, and overcome them even perforce, and ascertained what spirit his friends have.
Straightway perspiration without measure flows down my skin,5 and I am fluttered when I look at the prime of my equals-in-age, delightsome alike and beautiful;
for it ought to be of longer duration, but, like a dream, precious youth is a short-lived thing:
and presently over-head hangs unhappy and unsightly old age.
Never will I place my neck under the galling yoke of my enemies, not even though Tmolus1 is above my head.
To the meaner sort their minds are more empty through baseness :
but the doings of the noble are always more direct.
The practice of mischief, look you, among men is easy:
but the method2 of good, Cyrnus, is difficult.
Take courage, mine heart, in troubles, e'en though you have suffered things unendurable:
a the heart of the baser sort, look you, is ever too hasty.
Neither do you, at any rate, aggravating your chagrin at works that-have-been-un­ accomplished,4 bear hate, nor be indignant:
neither vex your friends.
Nor delight your enemies:
for the destined awards of the gods not easily could mortal man escape, either if he de­ scended to the bottom of the dark lake, or when murky Tar­ tarus holds him.
To beguile a noble man, look you, is most difficult, as it bath long been decided, Cyrnus, in my judgment.
I knew it indeed even before, but much better now ;
that the mean have no gratitude.
Senseless and fools are the men who drink not wine when the dog-star rises.
5
Come hither, with the aid of the piper let us laugh and drink beside one that weeps, whilst we de­ light in his griefs.
Let us sleep:
and the watching over the city shall be the warder's care, the watch over our lovely reckless fatherland.
Yes, by Jove, if any of these sleeps even wrapped-up, he will listen to our revelling eagerly.
Now let us drink and enjoy ourselves, speaking fairly :
and what shall be hereafter, that is the gods' concern.
1To you now, as to a dear child, I myself will give sound advice;
and do you ponder these things in your heart and mind.
2
Never do any evil hastily, but deliberate in the deep of your heart, and with your better mind.
For of them that contend, 'tis the heart and the mind that contend;
but coUP sel leads to a good and sound mind.
But this account we will let-pass.
3
Do thou however pipe to me and both of us will be mindful of the Muses.
For they have given these delightful gifts to-hold, to thee, and me, and in truth to the dwellers-all-around.
Timagoras, 'tis hard for one-seeing-from-far, to understand the temper of many,1 even though he be wise.
For some have meanness disguised by riches;
and others rank by ruin­ ous poverty.
But in youth 'tis best to sleep beside an equal-in-age, satis­ fying the desire of works of-love:
'tis better too to sing with a piper accompanying you, when you go a revelling:
than this nought, look you, else is more delightsome to men and women.
What to me are riches and dignity?
Delight along with good cheer surpasses everything.
Senseless and childish are the men, who mourn for the dead, and not the flower of manhood, when it perishes.
Prithee, delight thyself, dear heart:
4 soon will there be some other men, and I in death shall be black earth.
Cyrnus, direct a various temper-of-mind towards all your friends, mingling such a character as each is of.
One while follow this character ;
at another be diverse in your nature :
a better thing, look you, is wisdom than great excellence.
Of a thing unaccomplished 'tis most hard to know the end,1 how the god will accomplish this.
For gloom is spread over it, and previous to that which is about to be, the bounds of human helplessness are not to-be-understood.
No one of mine enemies will I blame, if he be noble ;
2 no, nor will I commend a friend, if he be a mean man.
Thus it behoves the well-born man, I wot, directing his thoughts to it, to keep them ever stedfast until the end to a friend.
You needs must bear worthily many unpleasant things,3 since you know not how to do that which is not pleas­ ant to yourself.
Castor and Pollux, ye who dwell in divine Lacedæmon 4 on the Eurotas, beautifully-flowing stream, if ever I should de­ vise evil for a friend, may I myself find it:
but should he de­ vise aught against me, may he find twice as much.
My mind is distressed respecting your friendship:
5 for I can neither love nor hate you:
knowing as I do that 'tis hard to hate, after one has been a friend to a man;
and hard to love a man without his concurrence.
Look therefore now to another;
to me at least there was no constraint to do this:
namely, the kindnesses, for which aforetime you were grateful to me.
Now even on wings am I uplifted, like a bird from a vast marsh, having escaped from a base man, and having dragged away my neck
But you, when you have lost my friendship, will afterwards be sensible of my prudence, no matter who it was that counselled you concerning me, and bade you go away and abandon my friendship.
Insolence bath ruined both the Magnesians, and Colophon, and Smyrna:
2 Cyrnus, it will certainly ruin us likewise.
But having been put to the test, and being rubbed beside lead, as being refined gold, you will be fair to all.
Ah wretched me !
for now have I become a laughing-stock to foes, and to my friends a trouble, having suffered sadly.
O Cyrnus, they who were noble aforetime, are now on the other hand mean :
and those who were base before, are now noble:
who can endure to look upon3 these things, to wit, the noble more dishonoured, and the baser sort obtaining honour?
whilst the well-born man espouses a wife from a mean man's house.
So deceiving each other they exult one over the other, cherishing remembrance neither of good nor bad.
Possessing riches, you have reproached me with poverty:
4 but something I have, and something more I shall make, after having paid my vows to the gods.
O wealth, of all gods fairest and most delightsome, with thy aid, e'en though mean, I become a noble man.
May I have youth's prime, and may Latona's son,5 Phoebus Apollo, love me, and Jove, sovereign of immortals ;
that so I may live my life aloof from all ills, delighting my spirit with youth and riches.
Remind me not of ills :
I have suffered, look you, such treatment as.
Ulysses ;
1 who went to the vast mansion of Hades, and came up again from it;
Ulysses, who, prudent as in truth he was, also slew with pitiless steel the suitors of Penelope, his wedded spouse :
sce who had long awaited him, while she remained abiding beside his dear son, until he set foot in the land, and trod the terror-causing inmost corners.
2
If I but drink, I care not tor spirit-wasting poverty,3 nor hostile men, who speak ill of me.
But I lament for delight­ some youth, which is failing me:
and I bewail troublesome old-age coming-upon-me.
Cyrnus, for present friends we will stay the beginning of ill:
4 and let us seek remedies for the growing wound.
Hope alone remains a kind goddess among mortals,5 the rest have abandoned us, and gone to Olympus.
Gone is Faith, a mighty goddess:
gone from men Temper­ ance :
the Graces too, my friend, have quitted earth, and just oaths are no more to be relied on among men, neither does any-one reverence the immortal gods.
1
But the race of holy men hath waned, nor are they any longer sensible of ordinances, no, nor holy lives.
Yet so long as a man lives, and beholds the light of the sun, acting-piously as regards the gods, let him wait on Hope.
And let him pray to the gods, burning also splendid thighs of victims,2 and to Hope let him sacrifice first and last.
And let him ever muse on the per­ verted language of unjust men, who, nowise reverencing the immortal gods, are ever setting their thoughts on the pos­ sessions of others, having attached shameful marks to evil deeds.
Never let go your present friend, and seek out another,3 complying with the words or meaner men.
Be it mine to be rich, aloof from evil cares, and to live harmlessly, meeting-with no ill.
I neither long nor pray to be rich:
4 but be it mine to live on my little store, and find no hurt.
Wealth and wisdom are a matter most irresistible ever;
for neither could you over-fill the desire with wealth:
5 and in like manner the wisest man doth not shun wisdom, but longs after it:
yet cannot satisfy his desire therewith.
No treasure is it better to lay-up-for your children ;
6 yet give it, Cyrnus, to noble men when they crave it.
For no man is in all respects all-blessed :
1 but the noble man has re­ solution to keep his misfortune, albeit not manifest to all, whilst the meaner person knows not how to keep his spirit even alike, in prosperity or in adversity.
But on mortals fall various behests of the immortals ;
to endure then the gifts of the immortals, such as they give men to have, it is meet.
In prudent men, eyes, tongue, and ears, and man's intelli­ gence are-by-nature in the midst of their breasts.
2
Company with the noble :
but never follow the base, when­ soever you are finishing a journey or your framed
Of the noble noble is the answer, noble the works :
but of the baser sort the winds carry away the worthless words.
From evil- company come ills :
and well wilt thou too understand this, since thou hast erred against the mighty immortals.
The gods, 0 Cyrnus, give judgment as the best boon to mortals :
4 judgment hath the issues of every man.
0 happy he that truly hath it in his mind.
Verily it is far superior to dangerous insolence and wretched satiety.
But satiety is an evil to mortals:
than which two nought is more evil;
for all mischief, Cyrnus, is from these.
Would that, 0 Cyrnus, thou mightest be clear from suffering and doing disgraceful deeds ;
then wouldst thou have greatest experience in virtue.
Cyrnus, reverence and fear the gods ;
1 for this prevents man either from doing or saying unholy things.
To lay-low a tyrant that grindeth-down-his-people, even as you will,2 is no call for wrath on the part of the gods.
Good sense and good speech, these things are-by-nature in but few men,3 who are masters of both these.
No one by paying ransom can escape death4 or severe misfortune, unless fate impose an issue.
Neither can mortal man, though he wish it, by gifts escape anxieties, to wit, when the god sends griefs.
I desire not to lie in regal couch when dead;
5 but be mine some good thing whilst I am yet alive.
Prickles, I ween, to a dead man are a like couch to embroidered carpets ;
the wood is either hard or soft:
it matters not.
Neither swear by the gods a perjured oath, for it is not en­ durable to hide from the immortals a debt that is due.
I hear, son of Poly pas, the voice of the shrill-crying crane,6 even her, who to mortals comes as harbinger of the season for ploughing ;
and it smote my dark heart7 that others possess my flourishing fields, neither do my mules drag the bent-yoke of the plough, on account of that ever-to-be-remembered voyage.
I will not go, neither shall a tyrant be lamented by me,1 nor go beneath the earth with wailing over his tomb.
No, nor would he, if I were dead, either be grieved, or let fall warm tears adown his eyes.
I neither forbid you, nor invite you, to revel:
you will be troublesome, when present, and friendly, whensoever you are absent.
2
I am Æthon by family:
but, forced from my fatherland,3 I dwell in Thebes, a well-fortified city.
Mock me not rudely, Argyris, nor abuse my dear parents:
for upon you presses the day of servitude;
but for me, woman, there are many other ills indeed, for I am an exile from my country ;
yet dis­ tressing slavery hangs not over me, nor do men export us for sale,4 and even for us indeed there is a fair city, situate in oblivion's plain.
Never let us sit down and laugh beside them that mourn,' O Cyrnus, delighting ourselves in our own advantages.
To deceive an enemy, indeed, and ill-affected man, is hard, Cyrnus :
but for a friend to deceive a friend is easy.
NOUGHT, Cyrnus, is more unjust than anger, which hurts its possessor, by meanly indulging passion.
Nothing, Cyrnus, is more sweet than a good wife:
2 I am a witness, and be thou so to me of my truthfulness.
Speech is wont to bring many false-steps to mortal men, when the judgment, Cyrnus, is disturbed.
The cares of men have had allotted to them,3 and possess, various wings, being divided for the sake of spirit and sub­ sistence.
Be young, dear heart:
soon will there be some other men;
and I, having died, shall be dark earth.
But growing old, he is distinguished among the citizens,4 nor does any wish to hurt him, in point of respect or justice.
On no one, Cyrnus, do the rays of the sun that-giveth- light-to-men look down, over whom blame doth not hang.
But I am not able to ascertain what mind the citizens enter­ tain, for neither when I do good nor ill do I satisfy them.
For heretofore hath a marine corpse invited me home,1 though dead, yet speaking with living voice.
The Proem is a rhapsody in honour of the Muses.
It opens with a descrip­ tion of their solemn dances on Helicon, and of the hymns which they sing during their nightly visitation of Earth.
The poet then relates their ap­ pearance to himself, and his consequent inspiration;
describes their em­ ployments in Heaven, their birth and dignity;
their influence on kings, minstrels, and bards;
and finishes with invoking their assistance, and proposing his subject.
The COSMOGONY, or Origin of Nature, then com­ mences, and blends into the THEOGONY, or Generation of the Gods, which is continued through the whole poem, and concludes with the race of demigods, or those born from the loves of goddesses and mortals.
The following legendary fables are interwoven episodically with the main sub­ ject:
I. The Conspiracy of Earth and Cronus, or Saturn, against Uranus or Heaven.
II.
The Concealment of the Infant Jupiter.
III.
The Im­ piety and Punishment of Prometheus.
IV.
The Creation of Pandora, or Woman.
V. The War of the Gods and Titans.
VI.
The Combat of Jupiter and Typhœus.
BEGIN we from the Muses, 0 my song !
Whose mansion is the mountain vast and holy Of Helicon ;
where aye with delicate feet Fast by Jove's altar and purpureal fount
They tread the measur'd round:
their tender limbs Lav'd in Permessian waters, or the stream Of blest Olmίus, or pure Hippocrene, On the high top of Helicon they wont To lead the mazy measure, breathing grace, Enkindling love, and glance their quivering feet.
Thence break they forth tumultuous, and enwrapt Wide with dim air, through silence of the night Shape their ethereal way, and send abroad A voice, in stilly darkness beautiful.
Jove ægis-arm'd they praise, in choral hymns
Of adoration;
and of Argos nam'd Majestic Juno, gliding on her way With golden-sandal'd feet;
and her whose eyes Glitter with azure light, Minerva born From Jove;
Apollo, sire of prophecy, And Dian, joyous in the sounding shaft;
Earth-shaker Neptune, earth-enclasping god;
And Themis, name adorable in heaven;
And Venus, lovely with her tremulous lids;
And Hebe, who with golden fillet binds Her brow ;
and fair Dione, and the Morn, And the great Sun, and the resplendent Moon ;
Latona, and Iäpetus, and him Of mazy counsel, Saturn ;
and the Earth, And the vast Ocean, and the sable Night;
And all the holy race of deities Existing ever.
They to Hesiod erst Have taught their stately song ;
the whilst his flocks
He fed beneath all-sacred Helicon.
Thus first those goddesses their heavenly speech Address'd, th' Olympian Muses born from Jove :
" Night-watching shepherds!
beings of reproach!
Ye grosser natures, hear!
we know to speak Full many a fiction false, yet seeming-true, Or utter at our will the things of truth.
"So said they-daughters of the mighty Jove All-eloquent-and gave unto my hand Wondrous!
a verdant rod ;
a laurel-branch
Of bloom unwithering;
and a voice imbreath'd Divine;
that I might utter forth in song
The future and the past:
and bade me sing
The blessed race existing evermore, And first and last resound the Muses' praise.
But why this wandering tale, as it were told
In oaken shade, or shelter of the rock ?
Come, from the Muses let the song proceed, Who the great spirit of their father Jove Delight in heaven;
and with symphonious voice
Of soft agreement, in their hymns proclaim The present, and the future, and the past.
Flows inexhaustible from every tongue
That sweetest voice:
the Thunderer's palaces Laugh in their melody, while from the lips
Of those fair goddesses the honeyed sounds Are scatter'd far and wide.
Olympus rings
From every snow-topt summit, and resound
The mansions of celestials.
They a voice Immortal uttering, first in song proclaim
The race of venerable Gods, who rose From the beginning, whom the spacious Heaven And Earth produced;
and all the deities From them successive sprung, dispensing good.
Next also Jove, the sire of gods and men, They praise ;
or when they lift the solemn song, Or when surcease:
how excellent he is Above all gods, and in his might supreme.
Now to the race of Men, and hardy brood Of Giants, flows the strain;
and thus in heaven Th' Olympian Muses charm the mind of Jove.
Them erst Mnemosyne, whose empire sways Eleuther's fertile soil, conceived in shades Pierian, with their sire Saturnius there Blending embrace of love:
they to all ills Oblivion yield, to every troubled thought Rest:
thrice three nights did all-consulting Jove Melt in her arms, apart from eyes profane
Of all immortals, to the sacred couch Ascending:
but when now roll'd round the year, And moons had wan'd and seasons due revolv'd
And days were numbered, she the virgins nine Gave at a birth ;
in unison of soul Attempered soft, whose care is only song ;
In whose free bosom dwells th' unsorrowing mind.
They saw the light of heaven no distant space From where Olympus his extremest top Rears in eternal snow.
There on the mount
They dwell in mansions beautified, and shine
In the smooth pomp of dance :
and them beside
The sister Graces hold abode;
and Love Himself is nigh, participant in feast.
So through their parted lips a lovely voice
The Muses breathe ;
they sing the laws that bind
The universal heaven ;
the manners pure
Of deathless gods, and lovely is their voice.
Anon they toward th' Olympian summits bend
Their steps, exulting in the charm of voice, And songs of immortality :
remote
The dusky earth remurmurs musical
The echo of their hymnings ;
and beneath
Their many-rustling feet a pleasant sound Ariseth, as tumultuous pass they on To greet their awful sire.
He reigns in heaven,
The glowing bolt and lightning in his grasp, Since by ascendant strength cast down from high Saturn his father fell:
hence Jove to all Disposes all things ;
to th' eternal gods Ordering their honours.
Thus the Olympian maids Are wont to sing, the daughters nine of Jove :
Clio, Thalia, and Melpomene, Urania, Erăto, Terpsichore, Polymnia and Euterpe, and the last Calliope:
—she, proudly eminent O'er every Muse, with kings majestical Associate walks.
Whom of the monarch race, The foster-sons of Jove, the Muses will To honour ;
on whose infant head, when first Ushered to light, they placid look from high With smiling aspect;
on his tongue they shed A gentle dew, and words as honey sweet Drop from his lips.
On him the people's eyes Wait awful, who in righteousness discerns
The ways of judgment;
who in wisdom speaks Infallible, and straight the contest calms When mightiest.
Lo! in this are monarchs wise;
That from the seat of justice to the wrong'd
They turn the tide of things, retrieving ills With mild accost of soothing eloquence.
Him, when he walks the city-ways, all hail With gentlest awe, and as he were a god Propitiate:
him th' assembled council view Conspicuous in the midst.
Lo! such to man The Muse's gift all-sacred.
From the Muse And Phœbus, archer-god, arise on earth Minstrels and men of song ;
but kings arise From Jove himself.
Unutterably blest 140 He whom the Muses love.
A melting voice Flows ever from his lip:
and is there one
Whose aching heart some sudden anguish wrings ?
But lo !
the bard, the Muse's minister, Awakes the strain:
he sings the mighty deeds
Of men of yore:
the praise of blessed gods
In heaven :
and straight, though stricken to the soul, He shall forget, nor aught of all his griefs Remember:
so the blessing of the Muse Hath instantaneous turned his woes away.
Daughters of Jove, all-hail!
but 0 inspire
The lovely song !
the sacred race proclaim
Of ever-living gods ;
who sprang from Earth, From the starr'd Heaven, and from the gloomy Night, And whom the salt Deep nourish'd into life.
Declare how first the gods and earth became ;
The rivers, and th' immeasurable sea High-raging in its foam :
the glittering stars, The wide-impending heaven ;
and who from these Of deities arose, dispensing good :
Say how their treasures, how their honours each Allotted shared :
how first they held abode
On many-cav'd Olympus :
-this declare, Ye Muses !
dwellers of the heavenly mount From the beginning ;
say, who first arose ?
First Chaos was :
next ample-bosom'd Earth, The seat eternal and immoveable Of deathless gods, who still th' Olympian heights Snow-topt inhabit.
Third, in hollow depth
Of the vast ground, expanded wide above The gloomy Tartarus.
Love then arose, Most beauteous of immortals :
he at once
Of every god and every mortal man Unnerves the limbs ;
dissolves the wiser breast
By reason teel'd, and quells the very soul.
From Chaos, Erebus and sable Night .... From Night arose the Sunshine and the Day ;
Whom she with dark embrace of Erebus Commingling bore.
Her first-born Earth produced
Of like immensity, the starry Heaven :
That he might sheltering compass her around
On every side, and be for evermore
To the blest gods a mansion unremov'd.
Next the high hills arose, the pleasant haunts
Of goddess-nymphs, who dwell among the glens Of mountains.
With no aid of tender love Gave she to birth the sterile Sea, high swoll'n
In raging foam ;
and, Heaven-embraced, anon She teem'd with Ocean, rolling in deep whirls His vast abyss of waters.
Croeus then, Cæus, Hyperion, and Iäpetus, Themis, and Thea rose ;
Mnemosyne, And Rhea ;
Phœbe diadem'd with gold, And love-inspiring Tethys :
and of these, Youngest in birth, the wily Saturn came, The sternest of her sons ;
and he abhorr'd
The sire that gave him life.
Then brought she forth The Cyclops haughty of spirit:
Steropes, Brontes, and Arges of impetuous soul;
Who gave to Jove his thunder, and who forged The lightning flame.
Resembling gods they were, Save that a single ball of sight was fix'd
In their mid-forehead :
hence the Cyclops' name :
For that one circular eye was broad infixed
In the mid-forehead :
—strength was theirs, and force, And craft of curious toil.
Then other sons
Were born of Earth and Heaven :
three mighty sons
And valiant;
dreadful but to name ;
a race Aspiring ;
Cottus, Gyges, Brίareus.
A hundred arms from forth their shoulders burst, Mocking approach;
and fifty heads upsprang
O'er limbs of sinewy mould :
their giant forms Tower'd huge, in bold immeasurable strength.
Of all the children sprung from Earth and Heaven, The fiercest these ;
but all their sire abhorred From the beginning :
all his race he seized
As each was born, and hid in cave profound, Nor e'er released to day ;
and in his work Malign exulted Heaven.
Then inly groaned
The vast Earth, grief-opprest, and straight devised Ill stratagem of fraud :
and thus intent, When now she had produced a whiter kind Of tempered iron, cunning-wrought she forg'd A sickle huge, and to her children spake:
Daring she spake, yet at her heart aggriev'd :
— "
My sons !
alas, ye children of a sire
Most impious, now obey a mother's voice ;
So shall we well avenge the fell despite
Of him, your father, who the first devised Deeds of injustice.
"While she said, on all Fear seized ;
nor utterance found they, till with soul Embolden'd, wily Saturn huge addressed His awful mother."
Mother, be the deed
My own :
thus pledged, I will most sure achieve
This feat;
nor heed I him, our sire, of name Detested;
for that he the first devis'd Deeds of injustice.
"Thus he said :
and Earth Was gladden'd at her heart.
She planted him In ambush dark and secret:
to his grasp
The rough-tooth'd sickle gave, and tutor'd him In every wile.
Vast Heaven came down from high,
And with him brought the gloominess of night
On all beneath :
with ardour of embrace Hovering o'er Earth, in his immensity He lay diffused around.
The wily son From secret ambush then his weaker hand Put forth :
his right the sickle grasp'd, with teeth Horrent, and huge, and long :
and from his sire
He swift the source of generative life Cut sheer :
then cast behind him far away
The bloody ruin.
But not so in vain Escap'd it from his hold :
the gory drops Earth, as they gush'd, received.
When years roll'd round
Thence teem'd she with the fierce Eumenides, And giants huge in stature, all in mail Radiant, and wielding long-protended spears :
And Nymphs, wide worshipped o'er the boundless earth By Dryad name.
So severing with keen steel
The sacred spoils, he from the continent Amidst the many surges of the sea Hurl'd them.
Full long they drifted o'er the deeps;
Till now swift-circling a white foam arose From that immortal substance, and a nymph Was nourished in the midst.
The wafting waves First bore her to Cythera the divine:
To wave-encircled Cyprus came she then, And forth emerg'd, a goddess, in the charms Of awful beauty.
Where her delicate feet Had prest the sands, green herbage flowering sprang.
Her Aphrodite gods and mortals name, The foam-born goddess :
and her name is known As Cytherea with the blooming wreath, For that she touched Cythera's flowery coast;
And Cypris, for that on the Cyprian shore She rose, amid the multitude of waves.
Love tracked her steps, and beautiful Desire Pursued;
while soon as born she bent her way Toward heaven's assembled gods;
her honours these From the beginning ;
whether gods or men
Her presence bless, to her the portion fell
Of virgin whisperings, and alluring smiles, And smooth deceits, and gentle ecstasy, And dalliance, and the blandishments of love.
Now the great Heaven, rebuking in his wrath
The sons whom he had form'd, the Titan name Stamped on his offspring, who vindictive wrought A heinous act audacious :
after-time Should bring the vengeance ;
they should rue the deed.
Abhorred Fate, and dark Necessity, And Death, were born from Night;
by none embrac'd
These gloomy Night brought self-conceiving forth :
And Sleep ;
and all the hovering host of Dreams.
Again she teem'd with Momus ;
Care full-fraught With many griefs :
and next th' Hesperian maids, Whose charge oversees the fruits of bloomy gold Beyond the sounding ocean, the fair trees Of golden fruitage.
Then the Destinies Arose;
and Fates in vengeance pitiless ;
Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos, Who at the birth of men dispense the lot Of good and evil.
They of men and gods
The crimes pursue ;
nor ever pause from wrath Tremendous, till destructive on the head
Of him that sins the retribution fall.
Then teemed pernicious Night with Nemesis, The scourge of mortal men ;
again she bore Fraud, and lascivious Love;
slow-wasting Age, And still-persisting Strife.
From hateful Strife Came sore affliction, and oblivion drear;
Famine, and weeping sorrows ;
combats, wars, And slaughters, and all homicides;
and brawls, And bickerings, and deluding lies :
with them Came lawlessness and galling injury, Inseparable mates;
and the dread oath- A mighty bane to him of earth-born men
Who wilful swears, and perjur'd is forsworn.
The Sea with Earth embracing, Nereus rose, Eldest of all his race ;
pure from deceit
And true;
with filial veneration nam'd Ancient of years :
for mild and blameless he ;
Remembering still the right;
still merciful
As just in counsels.
Then rose Thaumas huge, Phorcys the strong, and Ceto fair of cheek, And last Eurybia, of an iron soul.
From Nereus and the fair-hair'd Doris, nymph
Of ocean's perfect stream, the lovely race Of goddess Nereids rose to light, whose haunt Is midst the waters of the sterile main.
Eucrate, Proto, Thetis, Amphitrite, Love-breathing Thalia, Sao, and Eudora, And Spio, skimming with light feet the wave ;
Galene, Glauce, and Cymothoe;
Agave, and the graceful Melita ;
Rose-arm'd Eunice, and Eulimene;
Pasithea, Doto, E'rato, Pherusa, Nesæa, Cranto, and Dynamene ;
Protomedia, Doris, and Actæa ;
And Panope, and Galatæa fair ;
Hippothο̈e winning soft;
Hipponöe The roseate-arm'd ;
Cymodoce who calms
The stormy billows of the darkened main, And blasts of mighty winds ;
her aids the Nymph Cymatolege, while along the deep With beauteous ankles Amphitrite glides :
Cymo, Εϊοne, Liagore, And, grac'd with blooming sea-wreath, Halimed:
Pontoporίa, and Polynome ;
Evagore, and blythe Glauconome ;
Laomedia, and Evarne sweet Of nature, as unblemished in her charms;
Lysianassa and Autonome, And Psamathe of all-engaging form;
Menippe the divine ;
and Pronoe, And Neso, and Eupompe, and Themistho ;
And last Nemertes, with prophetic soul Blest of her sire immortal.
These are they From blameless Nereus born, the fifty nymphs
In labours vers'd of blameless ministry.
Electra, nymph of the deep-flowing main, Embraced with Thaumas :
rapid Iris thence Rose, and Aello, and Ocypetes, The sister harpies, fair with streaming locks :
On fleetest wings upborne, they chase aloft
The hovering birds and wandering winds, and soar Into the heaven.
From Ceto fair of cheek, And Phorcys, came the Graiæ :
(gray they were E'en from the natal hour, and hence their name Is known among the deities on high And man's earth-wandering race.)
Pephredo clad
In flowing vesture, and her sister nymph, The eaffron-rob'd Eny'o.
Then were born The Gorgons ;
who beyond the sounding main Inhabit, on th' extremest verge of earth, Where night enwraps the pole, and where the maids Hesperian warble forth their thrilling strains.
Stheno, Euryale, Medusa last, Deep-suffering;
for that mortal is her date :
The two immortal, and in bloom unchanged.
Yet her alone the blue-hair'd god of waves Enfolded, on the tender meadow-grass And bedded flowers of spring:
and when from her Perseus the head dissever'd, then upsprang Chrysaor huge, and Pegasus the steed, So nam'd, near ocean's fountains born;
but he, Chrysaor, in his hands a falchion held Of beamy gold :
rapt on the winged horse
He left beneath him Earth, mother of flocks, And soar'd to heaven's immortals :
and there dwells
In palaces of Jove, and to the god Deep-counsell'd, bears the bolt and arrowy flame.
Chrysaor with Calliröe blending love, Nymph of sonorous ocean, sprang to birth Three-headed Geryon :
him did Hercules Slay spoiling, 'midst his oxen pliant-hoofd, On Erythia girdled by the wave :
What time those oxen ample-brow'd he drove To sacred Tyrinth, the broad ocean-way Once past;
and Orthus, the grim herd-dog, stretch'd Lifeless ;
and in their murky den beyond
The billows of the long-resounding deep, The keeper of those herds, Eurytion, slain.
Another monster Ceto bore anon
In the deep-hollow'd cavern of a rock, Stupendous, nor in shape resembling aught Of human nor of heavenly;
the divine Echidna, the untameable of soul:
Above, a nymph with beauty-blooming cheeks
And eyes of jetty lustre ;
but below, A speckled serpent horrible and huge, Bloody-devouring, monstrous, hid in caves Of sacred earth.
There in the uttermost depth
Her cavern is, within a vaulted rock;
Alike from mortals and immortals deep Remote :
the gods have there her place assigned
In mansions known to fame.
So pent beneath
The rocks of Arima, Echidna dwelt Hideous ;
a nymph immortal, and in youth Unchanged for evermore.
But legends tell
That with the jet-eyed nymph the whirlwind fierce, His terrible embrace, Typhaon, join'd :
She, fill'd with love, a progeny conceived Of strain undaunted.
Geryon's dog of herds, Orthus, the first arose :
the second birth, Unutterable, was the dog of hell, Voracious, brazen-voiced, and bold and strong, The fifty-headed Cerberus:
and third Upsprang the Hydra, pest of Lerna's lake ;
Whom Juno, white-arm'd goddess, fostering train'd
With deep resentment fill'd, insatiable, 'Gainst Hercules ;
but he, the son of Jove, Named of Amphytrion, in the dragon's gore Bath'd his unpitying steel, by warlike aid Of Iolaus, and the counsels high Of Pallas the Despoiler.
Last came forth Chimaera, breathing deluges of flame Unconquerable ;
a monster grim and huge, And swift and strong, and crested with three heads-
A lion's tawny semblance one;
and one As of a goat;
a mighty snake's the third.
In front the lion threatened ;
and behind
The serpent;
and the goat was in the midst, Exhaling fierce the strength of burning flame :
On the wing'd horse her brave Bellerophon Slew.
She, compell'd by Orthus, gave to birth Depopulating Sphynx, of Cadmus' race
The fell destruction ;
and the lion bore Nam'd of Nemaea :
him to fierceness rear'd Jove's glorious consort;
and his lair assign'd Among Nemæa's hills, the pest of men.
There lurking in his haunts he long insnar'd
The roving tribes of man, and held stern sway O'er cavern'd Tretum, o'er the mountain heights Of Apesantus, and Nemæa's wilds ;
Till strong Alcides quell'd his gasping strength.
Again, embraced by Phorcys, brought she forth Her youngest-born, the dreadful snake, that couch'd
In the dark earth's abyss, a wide domain, Holds o'er the golden apples wakeful guard.
To Ocean Tethys brought the rivers forth
In whirlpool waters roll'd :
Eridanus Deep-eddied, and Alpheus, and the Nile ;
Fair-flowing Ister, Strymon, and Meander, Phasis and Rhesus ;
Achelous bright * With silver-circled tides ;
Heptaporus, And Nessus ;
Haliacmon and Rhodius ;
Granίcus, Ladon, Simois the divine, Peneus, Hermus, and Sangarius vast;
Æsepus, and the smooth Caician stream ;
Ardescus, and Parthenius, and Evenus;
And last divine Scamander.
Bore she then A sacred race of Nymphs.
O'er spacious earth
They with the rivers and the king of day Claim the shorn locks of youth.
This portion hold From Jove, Admete, Pitho, and Ianthe, Electra, Doris, Prymno, Cly'mene;
Urania, heavenly fair;
Calliröe;
Rhodίa, Hippo, and Pasithöe;
Plexaure, Clytie, and Melobosis;
Idya, Thöe, Xeuxo, Galaxaure;
And amiable Dione, and Circeis Of nature soft, and Polydora fair;
Ploto the nymph of bright-dilated eye;
Perseis, Ianira, and Acaste ;
Xanthe, the sweet Petroea, saffron-rob'd Telestho;
Metis and Eurynome;
And Crisie, and Menestho, and Europa;
Asia, Calypso, love-enkindling nymph ;
And A'mphiro, and Tyche, and Eudora:
Ocyröe, and Styx:
but she the rest Transcends in excellence.
To Ocean these Were born, and Tethys, Nymphs of elder birth;
But more untold remain.
Three thousand nymphs
Of oceanic line, in beauty tread With ample step, and far and wide dispersed Haunt the green earth and azure depth of lakes, A blooming race of glorious goddesses.
As many rivers also, yet untold, Rushing with hollow-dashing sound, were born To awful Tethys:
but their every name
Is not for mortal man to memorate, Arduous;
yet known to all the dwellers round.
Now Thia, yielding to Hyperion's love, Bore the great Sun, and the resplendent Moon;
And Morn, that wide effuses rosy light To all earth-wandering men, and deathless gods
Whose mansion is yon ample firmament.
Eurybia, noble midst the goddess race, With Crius blending love, produced the god Pallas, Astraeus huge, and Perses, him Transcending all in many-scienc'd lore.
The Morn to huge Astræus bore the Winds Of spirit untam'd;
East, West, and South, and North Swift-rushing on his way, the goddess bore Embracing with a god.
Last, Lucifer,
The dawn-appearing star;
and all the host
That crown with glittering light the vault of heaven.
Styx, ocean-nymph, with Pallas blending love Bore Victory, whose feet are beautiful
In palaces;
aspiring Zeal, and Strength, And Force ;
illustrious children:
nor apart From Jove their mansion is:
for never throne
Is set in heaven, for never passes forth The Godhead on his way, but they are seen Behind his glory.
Where the Thunderer sits, There stablish they their seat:
so wisely wrought
The ocean-nymph, incόrruptible Styx :
What time the Lightning-sender call'd from heay'n, And summon'd to th' Olympian mountain vast All Deities immortal;
thus he spake:
" Hear, all ye gods!
Whoe'er in aid of Jove Shall give the Titans battle, he shall need No heavenly gift;
and all of honour held Erst midst immortals, be his portion still:
And he that murmur'd under Saturn's reign, Ungifted and unhonour'd, shall arise, As justice claims, to honours and rewards.
"Lo !
then, incorruptible Styx the first, Sway'd by the careful counsels of her sire, Stood on Olympus;
and her sons beside ;
There grac'd with honour, and with goodly gifts.
Her Jove ordain'd the great tremendous oath
Of deities;
her sons for evermore Indwellers in the heavens.
Alike to all, E'en as he pledged that sacred word, the god Performed:
so reigns he, strong in power and might.
Now Phœbe sought the love-delighting couch Of Casus ;
and embracing with a god Conceived the goddess;
and to her is born Latona, rob'd with azure ;
ever mild;
To mortals placid and immortal gods;
Mild from her birth, and gladsome o'er the rest
In heaven.
Anon she fam'd Asteria bore, Whom Perses, to his ample palace erst Leading, proclaimed his bride.
She fruitful teem'd With Hecat6, whom the Saturnian king O'er all hath honoured, and with glorious gifts Endowed:
allotting her divided sway O'er earth, and o'er the main untillable.
Nor less her honour in the starry skies Chief rev'renc'd by immortals ;
and whoe'er
Of earth-born men with custom'd sacrifice Propitiates Heaven, he then the name invokes Of Hecaté;
abundant honour straight Shall follow on his path, if to that prayer Gracious the goddess leans, and opulence Attend his footsteps;
for the power is hers.
O'er all the gods who born from earth and heaven Received their share of glory, she supreme Allotted empire holds:
nor aught from her Of all those honours midst the elder gods Titanic held, bath Jove in violence Revoke nor snatched away;
but as it stood
In the beginning, so her portioned power Endures.
She,.
sole-begotten, higher meed
Of glory hath obtained;
far ampler sway O'er heaven, and earth, and main:
for her doth Jove Delight to honour.
Lo !
to whom she wills
Her presence is vouchsafed, and instant aid Magnific:
whom she views with gracious eyes, He mid the forum o'er the people shines Conspicuous.
When the mailed men arise
To deadly battle, comes the goddess prompt
To whom she wills ;
bids rapid victory Await them, and extends the wreath of fame.
She sits upon the sacred judgment-seat Of venerable monarchs.
She is found Propitious, when in solemn games the youth Contending strive:
there is the goddess nigh With succour:
he whose hardiment and strength Victorious prove, with ease the graceful palm Achieving, joyous o'er his parents' age Sheds a bright gleam of glory.
She is known
To them propitious, who the fiery steed Rein in the course;
and them who labouring cleave Through the blue watery vast th' untractable way.
They call upon the name of Hecaté With vows;
and his, loud-sounding god of waves, Earth-shaker Neptune:
easily at will The glorious goddess yields the woodland prey Abundant;
easily, while scarce they start
On the mocked vision, snatches them in flight.
She too with Hermes is propitious found To herd and fold;
and bids increase the droves Innumerable of goats and fleecy flocks, And swells their numbers, or their numbers thins.
The sole-begotten of her mother's love, She thus is honoured with all goodly gifts Amongst immortals.
Her did Jove appoint
The nursing-mother bland of infant youth ;
Of all who thenceforth to the morn's broad light Should raise the tender lid-this from the first
Her soothing office, and her honours these.
Embraced by Saturn, Rhea gave to light A glorious race.
She Vests, Ceres, bore, And Juno golden-sandal'd;
and of heart Ruthless, the mighty Pluto, him who dwells
In subterraneous palaces profound ;
Earth-shaker Neptune;
and consulting Jove, The sire of gods and men, whose thunder-peal Rocks the wide earth in elemental war.
But them, as issuing from the sacred womb
They touch'd the mother's knees, did Saturn huge Devour, revolving in his troubled thought Lest other of celestials midst the gods Usurp the kingly sway:
for to his ear
The tidings came, from Earth and Heaven star-crown'd, That it was doom'd by Fate, strong though he were, To his own son he should bow down his strength:
— Jove's wisdom this fulfill'd.
No blind design
He therefore cherish'd, and in.
crooked craft Devoured his children.
But when now was nigh
The birth of Jove, the sire of gods and men, Rhea both Heaven and Earth, her parents lov'd, Besought, that they might counsel and advise
How secretly the babe may spring to light;
And how the father's furies 'gainst his race, In subtlety devour'd, may meet revenge.
They to their daughter listen'd, and complied;
Proclaiming what the Destinies had doom'd
Of kingly Saturn and his dauntless son:
And her they sent to Lyctus, to the clime Of fruitful Crete.
And when her hour was come, The birth of Jove her youngest-born, then Earth Took to herself the mighty babe, to rear With nurturing softness in the spacious isle Of Crete.
So came she then, transporting him Swift through the darksome night, to Lyctus first;
And thence, upbearing in her arms, conceal'd Beneath the sacred ground, in sunless cave, Where shagg'd with densest woods th' Egean mount Impends.
But to th' imperial son of Heaven, Whilom the king of gods, a stone she gave Inwrapt in infant swathes;
and this with grasp Eager he snatch'd, and in his ravening breast Convey'd away:
unhappy!
nor once thought
That for the stone his child behind remained Invincible, secure ;
who soon, with hands
Of strength overcoming him, should cast him forth From glory, and himself th' immortals rule.
Swift throve the monarch-infant, and his limbs Teem'd with heroic vigour:
and with lapse
Of years, by Earth's all-subtle prudence foil'd, Huge Saturn, vers'd in mazy wiles, released His offspring, by the might and arts of Jove Vanquished.
He first the stone, the last devoured, Disgorg'd:
—this Jove in Pythos all-divine
On earth's broad surface fix'd, in the deep cleft Of high Parnassus, to succeeding times A monument, and miracle to man.
The brethren of his father too he loosed From their oppressive bonds;
the sons of Heaven, Whom Heaven, their sire, had in his phrensy bound.
They the good deed in grateful memory bore;
And gave the thunder, and the burning bolt, And lightning, which vast Earth had heretofore Hid in her central caves:
in these confides The God, and reigns o'er deities and men.
With Cly'mene, the beauteous-ankled nymph
Of ocean, shared Iäpetus the bed Of bridal love.
She bore to him a son Dauntless of heart, strong Atlas ;
the renowned Menœtius;
and Prometheus vers'd in arts
Of various cunning:
Epimetheus last, Of erring soul, who from the first drew down Sore evil on th' inventive race of man ;
For he the first from Jove unwary took
The clay-formed maid.
Flagitious in offence, Menœtius, by the smouldering lightning struck
Of wide-beholding Jove, to Erebus Fell headlong, through immeasurable pride Of impious guilt.
But Atlas the broad heaven
By strong necessity upholds:
his hands
And head he rears erect, against the clime
Where aye th' Hesperian Maids clear-warbling sing, On earth's far verge-the heavenly Counsellor This lot assigned him :
/and Prometheus versed
In various wiles he bound with fettering chains Indissoluble, chains of galling weight, Midway a column.
Down he sent from high
The broad-wing'd Eagle:
she his liver gorg'd Immortal;
for it sprang with life, and grew In the night-season, and the waste repaired Of what by day the bird of spreading wing Devoured.
But fair Alcmena's valiant son
The torturer slew, and from Prometheus drove
The cruel plague, and freed him from his pangs.
Nor yet high-reigning Jove withstood ;
that thence To Hercules of Thebes might glory arise Far ampler, o'er the many-nurturing earth.
Him honouring, from his former wrath did Jove Now rest;
the wrath which heretofore he felt, For that Prometheus 'gainst the wisdom strove Of Jupiter th' omnipotent.
When erst
The gods with mortals at Mecona held Contention, a huge ox with ready thought Dividing then, he set before the god His wisdom to beguile:
for here the flesh And entrails in the hide depositing With unctuous fat, the belly of the ox He covering close overlaid;
and there the bones With cunning skill adjusting he disposed, And in white fat enveloped.
Then the sire
Of gods and men :
"Son of Iäpetus !
O'er all of kingly race in arts renowned, O friend !
how partial are thy portioned shares!"
Thus of imperishable counsel spake
The god, and in his accent was reproach.
Him answered then Prometheus, deeply vers'd
In crooked subtlety, with laugh supprest, Nor of his arts forgetful:
" Glorious Jove !
Mightiest of ever-living gods!
of these Choose to thyself.
e'en as thy thought persuades.
"Musing deceit he spake ;
nor did not Jove, Of counsel incorruptible, the fraud Know and perceive;
and in his inmost thought Much evil he foredoomed to mortal man Which time should bring to pass.
With both his hands
He the white fat uprais'd from earth, and wrath Possessed him:
yea, his very soul was wroth, When laid with cunning artifice he saw The whitening bones.
Thenceforth the tribes of earth
The whitening bones consume, when climbs the smoke Wreathed from their fragrant altars.
Then again Cloud-gatherer Jove with indignation spake:
" Son of Iapetus !
o'er all deep versed
In counsels, dost thou then remember yet Thy arts delusive?
"So to wrath incens'd Spake he of wisdom incorruptible:
And still the fraud remembering, from that hour The strength of unexhausted fire denied To all the dwellers upon earth.
But him Benevolent Prometheus did beguile:
The far-seen splendour in a hollow reed
He stole, of inexhaustible flame.
But then Resentment stung the Thunderer's inmost soul;
And his heart chafd in anger, when he saw The fire far-gleaming in the midst of men.
Straight for the flame bestowed devis'd he ill To man.
And now the crippled artist-god, Illustrious, moulded from the yielding clay A bashful virgin's image, as advis'd Saturnian Jove.
Then Pallas azure-eyed Bound with the zone her bosom, and with robe
Of silvery whiteness deck'd her folded limbs ;
With her own hands a variegated veil Placed on her head, all-marvellous to sight;
Twined with her tresses a delicious wreath
Of mingled verdure and fresh-blooming flowers;
And clasp'd her brows with diadem of gold :
-
This Vulcan with his glorious hands had fram'd Elaborate, pleasing to the sire of gods.
Full many works of curious craft, to sight Wondrous, he grav'd thereon;
full many beasts
Of earth, and fishes of the rolling main;
Of these innumerable he there had wrought-
And elegance of art there shone profuse, And admirable—e'en as though they mov'd
In very life, and uttered animal sounds.
But now when this fair mischief, seeming-good, His hand had perfected, he led her forth Exulting in her grac'd attire, the gift Of Pallas, in the midst of gods and men.
On men and gods in that same moment seized
The ravishment of wonder, when they saw The deep deceit, th' inextricable snare.
For lo !
from her descend the tender sex Of Woman-a pernicious kind:
on earth
They dwell, destructive to the race of men :
With Luxury they, not life-consuming Want, Fitly consorted.
And as drones within
The close-roofd hive, cooperative in works Slothful and base, are nurtured by the bees,- These all the day till sinks the ruddy sun Haste on the wing, ' their murm'ring labours ply,'
And still cement the white and waxen comb ;
Those lurk within the sheltering hive close-roofd, And gather in their greedy maw the spoils Of others' labour,-such are womankind;
They whom the Thunderer sent, a bane to man, Ill helpmates of intolerable toils.
More evil yet he gave, in semblance veil'd
Of good:
for whoso, from the nuptial tie Averse, and vexing cares of woman-state, Wills not to wed, but destitute of her The cherisher of age, consumed by years Declines alone ;
he though perchance he live With plenty blest, yet in the death-hour leaves
His wealth dispersed to strangers from his blood.
Or he whose lot is marriage, and whose bride
Of modest fame, congenial to his heart, 810 Shall find that evil clashing with the good Contends perpetual.
But the man who gains
Her of injurious kind, lives bearing deep A wound within;
in heart and soul a grief Endless, and irremediable despair.
Therefore it is not given thee to deceive
The god, nor yet elude th' omniscient mind.
For not Prometheus, void of blame to man, Could 'scape the burden of oppressive wrath ;
And vain his various wisdom ;
vain to free From pangs, or burst th' inextricable chain.
When first their sire 'gainst Cottus, Briareus, And Gyges, felt his moody anger chafe Within him,—sore amaz'd with that their strength Immeasurable, their aspect fierce, and bulk Gigantic,-with a chain of iron force He bound them down, and fix'd their dwelling-place Beneath the spacious ground :
beneath the ground
They dwelt, in pain and durance :
in th' abyss
There sitting, where earth's utmost boundaries end.
Full long opprest with mighty grief of heart
They brooded o'er their woes :
but them did Jove Saturnian, and those other deathless gods
Whom fair-hair'd Rhea bore to Saturn's love, By counsel wise of Earth, lead forth again To light.
For she successive all things told :
How with the giant brethren they should win
The glory bright of conquest.
Long they fought With toil soul-harrowing;
they the deities Titanic and Saturnian;
each to each Oppos'd, in valour of promiscuous war.
From Othrys' lofty summit warr'd the host
Of glorious Titans ;
from Olympus they The band of gift-dispensing deities
Whom fair-hair'd Rhea bore to Saturn's love.
So wag'd they war soul-harrowing :
each with each
Ten years and more the furious battle join'd Unintermitted :
nor to either host Was issue of stern strife, nor end :
alike Did either stretch the limit of the war.
But now when Jove had set before his powers
All things befitting ;
the repast of gods,
The nectar and ambrosia, in each breast Kindled th' heroic spirit:
and now all
The nectar and ambrosia sweet had shar d, When spake the father of the gods and men :
"
Hear, ye illustrious race of Earth and Heaven, What now the soul within me prompts.
Full long Day after day in battle have we stood Opposed, Titanic and Saturnian gods, For conquest and for empire:
still do ye, In deadly combat with the Titans joined.
Strength mighty and unconquerable hands Display:
remembering our benignant love
And tender mercies which ye proved, again From restless agony of bondage ris'n, So will'd our counsel, and from gloom to day.
"He spake;
when answer'd Cottus the renown'd:
" 0 Jove august !
not darkly hast thou said :
Nor know we not how excellent thou art
In wisdom ;
from a curse most horrible Rescuing immortals :
0 imperial son Of Saturn !
by thy counsels have we ris'n Again, from bitter bondage and the depth
Of darkness, all unhoping of relief :
Then with persisting spirit and device
Of prudent warfare, shall we still assert
Thy empire midst the rage of arms, and still In hardy conflict brave the Titan foe.
"He ceas'd.
The gift-dispensing gods around Heard, and in praise assented :
nor till then So burn'd each breast with ardour to destroy.
All on that day rous'd infinite the war, Female and male :
the Titan deities, The gods from Saturn sprung, and those whom Jove From subterraneous gloom released to light :
Terrible, strong, of force enormous ;
burst A hundred arms from all their shoulders huge ;
From all their shoulders fifty heads upsprang
O'er limbs of sinewy mould.
They then array'd Against the Titans in fell combat stood, And in their nervous grasp wielded aloft Precipitous rocks.
On th' other side alert The Titan phalanx clos'd :
then hands of strength Join'd prowess, and displayed the works of war.
Tremendous then th' immeasurable sea Roar'd;
earth resounded:
the wide heaven throughout Groan'd shattering :
from its base Olympus vast Reel'd to the violence of gods :
the shock
Of deep concussion rock'd the dark abyss Remote of Tartarus :
the shrilling din Of hollow tramplings, and strong battle-strokes, And measureless uproar of wild pursuit.
So they reciprocal their weapons hurl'd Groan-scattering;
and the shout of either host Burst in exhorting ardour to the stars
Of heaven;
with mighty war-cries either host Encountering clos'd.
Nor longer then did Jove Curb his full power;
but instant in his soul
There grew dilated strength, and it was fill'd
With his omnipotence.
At once he loosed His whole of might, and put forth all the god.
The vaulted sky, the mount Olympian, Hashed With his continual presence ;
for he passed Incessant forth, and scattered fires on fires.
Hurl'd from his hardy grasp the lightnings flew Reiterated swift;
the whirling flash Cast sacred splendour, and the thunderbolt Fell:
roar'd around the nurture-yielding earth
In conflagration, far on every side Th' immensity of forests crackling blaz'd :
Yea, the broad earth burn'd red, the streams that mix With ocean, and the deserts of the sea.
Round and around the Titan brood of Earth Roll'd the hot vapour on its fiery surge ;
The liquid heat air's pure expanse divine Suffus'd :
the radiance keen of quivering flame
That shot from writhen lightnings, each dim orb, Strong though they were, intolerable smote, And scorched their blasted vision.
Through the void Of Erebus, the preternatural glare Spread, mingling fire with darkness.
But to see With human eye, and hear with ear of man, Had been, as if midway the spacious heaven, Hurtling with earth, shock'd—e'en as nether earth Crashed from the centre, and the wreck of heaven Fell ruining from high.
So vast the din, When, gods encountering gods, the clang of arms Commingled, and the tumult roar'd from heaven.
Shrill rush'd the hollow winds, and rous'd throughout A shaking, and a gathering dark of dust, The crush of thunders and the glare of flames, The fiery darts of Jove:
full in the midst
Of either host they swept the roaring sound Of tempest, and the shouting:
mingled rose The din of dreadful battle.
There stern strength Put forth the proof of prowess, till the fight Declin'd :
but first in opposite array Full long they stood, and bore the brunt of war.
Amid the foremost towering in the van
The war-unsated Gyges, Briareus, And Cottus, bitterest conflict wag'd:
for they Successive thrice a hundred rocks in air Hurl'd from their sinewy grasp:
with missile storm The Titan host overshadowing, them they drove All-haughty as they were, with hands of strength Overcoming them, beneath th' expanse of earth, And bound with galling chains ;
so far beneath
This earth, as earth is distant from the sky :
So deep the space to darksome Tartarus.
A brazen anvil rushing from the sky Through thrice three days would toss in airy whirl, Nor touch this earth till the tenth sun arose:
Or down earth's chasm precipitate revolve, Nor till the tenth sun rose attain the verge Of Tartarus.
A fence of massive brass
Is forg'd around:
around the pass is roll'd A night of triple darkness;
and above Impend the roots of earth and barren sea.
There the Titanic gods in murkiest gloom Lie hidden, such the cloud-assembler's will;
There in a place of darkness, where vast earth Has end:
from thence no egress open lies:
Neptune's huge hand with brazen gates the mouth Has clos'd;
a wall environs every side.
There Gyges, Coitus, high-soul'd Briareus Dwell vigilant, the faithful sentinels Of aegis-bearer Jove.
Successive there
The dusky earth, and darksome Tartarus, The sterile ocean, and the star-bright heaven, Arise and end, their source and boundary.
A drear and ghastly wilderness, abhorred E'en by the gods ;
a vast vacuity:
Might none the space of one slow-circling year Touch the firm soil, that portal entered once, But him the whirl of vexing hurricanes Toss to and fro.
E'en by immortals loath'd
This prodigy of horror.
There of Night Obscure the dismal dwellings rise, with mists
Of darkness overspread.
Full in the front Atlas upholding heaven his forehead rears
And indefatigable hands.
There Night And Day near passing, mutual greeting still Exchange, alternate as they glide athwart
The brazen threshold vast.
This enters, that Forth issues;
nor the two can one abode
At once constrain.
This passes forth, and roams
The round of earth ;
that in the mansion waits, Till the due season of her travel come.
Lo !
from the one the far-discerning light Beams upon earthly dwellers;
but a cloud
Of pitchy blackness veils the other round, Pernicious Night, aye-leading in her hand Sleep, Death's half-brother;
sons of gloomy Night, There hold they habitation, Death and Sleep, Dread deities;
nor them the shining Sun E'er with his beam contemplates, when he climbs
The cope of heaven, nor when from heaven descends.
Of these the one glides o'er the gentle space
Of earth and broad expanse of ocean waves, Placid to man :
the other has a heart
Of iron;
in his breast a brazen soul Is bosom'd, ruthless:
whom of men he grasps Stern he retains, e'en to immortal gods A foe.
The hollow-sounding palaces
Of subterraneous gods there in the front Ascend, of mighty Pluto and his queen Awful Persephone.
A grisly dog, Implacable, holds watch before the gates;
Of guile malicious.
Them who enter there, With tail and bended ears he fawning soothes;
But suffers not that they with backward step Repass:
whoe'er would issue from the gates Of Pluto strong and stern Persephone, For them with marking eye he lurks;
on them Springs from his couch, and pitiless devours.
There, odious to immortals, dreadful Styx Inhabits, refluent Ocean's eldest-born :
She from the gods apart for ever dwells
In mansions known to fame, with arching roofs O'erhung, of loftiest rock, and all around The silver columns lean upon the skies.
Swift-footed Iris, nymph of Thaumas born, Takes with no frequent embassy her way O'er the broad main's expanse, when haply strife Be risen, and midst the gods dissension sown.
And if there be among th' Olympian race Who falsehood utters, Jove sends Iris down, To bear from far, in ewer of gold, the wave Renown'd;
that from the summit of a rock Steep, lofty, cold distils.
Beneath wide Earth Abundant from the sacred parent-flood, Through shades of blackest night, the Stygian branch Of Ocean flows:
a tenth of all the streams
To the dread oath allotted.
In nine streams Round and around earth and the ocean broad With silver whirlpools mazy-roll'd, at length
It falls into the main:
one stream alone Glides from the rock, a mighty bane to gods.
Who of immortals that inhabit still Olympus topt with snow, libation pours
And is forsworn, he one whole year entire Lies reft of breath, nor yet approaches once
The nectar'd and ambrosial sweet repast:
But still reclines on the spread festive couch Mute, breathless;
and a mortal lethargy O erwhelms him:
but, his malady absolved With the great round of the revolving year, More ills on ills afflictive seize :
nine years
From ever-living deities remote
His lot is cast:
in council nor in feast
Once joins he, till nine years entire are full:
The tenth again he mingles with the blest
In synod, who th' Olympian mansions hold.
So great an oath the deities of heaven Decreed the waters incorruptible, Ancient, of Styx:
who sweeps with wandering waves A rugged region ;
where of dusky Earth, And darksome Tartarus, and Ocean waste, And the starr'd Heaven, the source and boundary Successive rise and end:
a dreary wild And ghastly, e'en by deities abhorred.
There gates resplendent rise;
the threshold brass;
Immoveable, on deep foundations fix'd, Self-framed:
before it the Titanic gods Abide, without th' assembly of the blest, Beyond the gulf of darkness:
there beneath The ocean-roots, th' auxiliaries renowned Of Jove loud-thundering, Gyges, Cottus, dwell:
But the deep-sounding shaker of the shores, Hailing him son, to Brίareus consigned, Brave as he was, his daughter for a bride, Cymopolia.
Now when Jove from heaven Had cast the Titans forth, huge Earth embraced By Tartarus, through love's all-golden queen, Her youngest-born Typhœus bore ;
whose hands
Of strength are fitted to stupendous deeds, And indefatigable are the feet Of the strong god ;
and from his shoulders rise A hundred snaky heads of dragon growth, Horrible, quivering with their blackening tongues.
In each amazing head from eyes that roll'd Within their sockets fire shone sparkling;
fire Blazed from each head, the whilst he roll'd his glance Glaring around him.
In those fearful heads
Were voices of all sound, miraculous Now uttered they distinguishable tones Meet for the ear of gods ;
now of a bull
The cry, loud-bellowing and untameable
In strength ;
and now the mighty roaring sound
As of a dauntless lion;
now the yell
Of whelps most strange to hear;
and breath'd he now Shrill hissings, that the lofty mountains rang.
Then had a dread event that fatal day Inevitable fallen, and he had rul'd
O'er mortals and immortals ;
but the sire
Of gods and men the peril instant knew, Intuitive, and vehement and strong He thundered:
instantaneous all around Earth reel'd with horrible crash;
the firmament Roar'd of high heaven;
the ocean-streams and seas And uttermost caverns.
While the king in wrath Uprose, beneath his everlasting feet Trembled Olympus;
groaned the stedfast earth.
From either side a burning radiance caught
The darkly rolling ocean, from the flash Of lightnings, and the monster's darted flame, Hot thunderbolts, and blasts of fiery winds.
Glow'd earth, air, sea;
the billows heav'd on high Foamed round the shores, and dash'd on every side Beneath the rush of gods.
Concussion wild And unappeasable uprose:
aghast
The gloomy monarch of th' infernal dead Trembled ;
the sub-tartarean Titans heard E'en where they stood, and Saturn in the midst;
They heard appall'd the unextinguish'd rage
Of tumult, and the din of dreadful war.
Now when the god, the fulness of his might Gathering at once, had grasped his radiant arms, The glowing thunderbolt and bickering flame, He from the summit of th' Olympian mount Leaped at a bound, and smote him :
hiss'd at once
The horrible monster's heads enormous, scorch'd
In one conflagrant blaze.
When thus the god Had quell'd him, thunder-smitten, mangled, prone, He fell;
beneath his weight earth groaning shook.
Flame from the lightning-stricken prodigy Flashed, midst the mountain-hollows, rugged, dark, Where he fell smitten.
Broad earth glowed intense
From that unbounded vapour, and dissolved :
—
As fusile tin by art of youths above
The wide-brimm'd vase up-bubbling foams with heat;
Or iron, hardest of the mine, subdued By burning flame, amid the mountain dells Melts in the sacred caves beneath the hands Of Vulcan,—so earth melted in the glare Of blazing fire.
He down wide Hell's abyss His victim hurl'd in bitterness of soul.
Lo !
from Typhoeus is the strength of the winds Moist-blowing ;
save the south, north, east, and west;
These born from gods, a blessing great to man :
Those, unavailing gusts, o'er the waste sea Breathe barren ;
with sore peril fraught to man, In whirlpool rage fall black upon the deep :
Now here, now there, they rush with stormy gale, Scatter the rolling barks, and whelm in death
The mariner ;
an evil succourless
To men who midst the ocean-ways their blast Encounter.
They again o'er all th' expanse
Of flowery earth the pleasant works of man Despoil, and fill the blacken'd air with cloud Of eddying dust and hollow rustlings drear.
But when the blest of heaven had now fulfilled
Their toils, for meed of glory 'gainst the gods Titanic, striving in their strength, they now, Counselled by Earth, exhort Olympian Jove, Of wide-beholding eyes, to regal sway And empire o'er immortals :
-he to them Due honours portioned with an equal hand.
First as a bride the monarch of the gods Led Metis :
her o'er deities and men Vers'd in all knowledge.
But when now at length
She would have given to birth the blue-eyed maid Minerva, he with treacheries of smooth speech
Her thought beguiling, her within himself Deposited :
so Earth and Heaven star-crown'd
Had counsell'd ;
him they both advising warn'd, Lest, in the place of Jove, another seize
The kingly honour o'er immortal gods.
For so the Fates had destine that from her An offspring should be born, of wisest strain First the Tritonian virgin azure-eyed ;
Of equal might and prudence with her sire :
And then a son, king over gods and men, Had she brought forth, invincible of soul, But Jove before that hour within himself Deposited the goddess ;
evermore So warning him of evil and of good.
Next led he Themis beauteous-bright, who bore Order, and Justice, and the blooming Peace, The Hours by name, who shed a grace o'er all The works of man.
Eurynome, the nymph
Of ocean, grac'd with all-engaging form, Three daughters bore to Jove :
the Graces fair Of cheek, Aglaia, Thalia winning-soft, Euphrosyne ;
their eyelids as they gaze Drop love, unnerving ;
and beneath the shade
Of their arched brows they steal the sidelong glance Of sweetness.
To the couch anon he came
Of many-nurturing Ceres:
Proserpine She bore, the snowy-arm'd ;
her gloomy Dis Snatched from her mother, and all-prudent Jove Consigned the prize.
Next lov'd he fair of locks Mnemosyne;
from her the Muses nine Are born;
their brows with golden fillets wreath'd ;
Whom feasts delight, and rapture sweet of song.
In mingled transport with Egean Jove Latona shaft-rejoicing Dian bore, And Phoebus, loveliest of the race of heaven.
He last the blooming Juno clasp'd as bride:
She Hebe, Mars, Lucina bore;
in love Consenting, with the king of gods and menHe from his head disclosed himself to birth
The blue-eyed maid Tritonian Pallas;
fierce, Rousing the war-field's tumult;
unsubdued;
Leader of armies ;
awful:
whom delight
The shout of battle and the shock of war.
Without th* embrace of love did Juno bear Illustrious Vulcan, o'er celestials grac'd With arts ;
and strove, and struggled with her spouse Emulous.
From the loud-resounding god, Shaker of earth, and Amphitrite, sprang Sea-potent Triton huge :
beneath the main Fast by his mother and his monarch sire
He dwells in golden edifice, a god Of awful might.
Now Venus gave to Mars, Breaker of shields, a dreadful offspring:
Fear, And Consternation ;
they in rout confound Of horrid war the phalanx dense of men, With city-spoiler Mars.
Harmonia last
She bore, whom generous Cadmus clasp'd as bride.
Daughter of Atlas Maia bore to Jove
The glorious Hermes, herald of the gods, The sacred couch ascending.
Semele, Daughter of Cadmus, melting in embrace With Jove, gave jocund Bacchus to the light;
A mortal, an immortal;
now alike Immortal deities.
Alcmena bore Strong Hercules, dissolving in embrace With the cloud-gatherer Jove.
The crippled god In arts illustrious, Vulcan, as his bride The gay Aglaia led, the youngest Grace.
Bacchus of golden hair, his blooming spouse, Daughter of Minos, Ariadne, clasp'd, With yellow tresses;
her Saturnian Jove Immortal made, and fearless of decay.
Fair-limb'd Alcmena's valiant son, achieved His agonizing labours, Hebe led A bashful bride, the daughter of great Jove, And Juno golden-sandal'd, on the top Snow-crested of Olympus.
Blest who thus, A mighty task accomplished, midst the gods Uninjured dwells, and free from withering age For evermore.
Perseis, ocean nymph Illustrious, to th' unwearied Sun produc'd Circe and king Æetes.
By the will
Of heaven, Æetes vaunting for his sire, The world-enlightening Sun, Idya led Cheek-blooming, nymph of ocean's perfect stream:
And through all-golden Venus she to love Subdued, Medea beauteous-ankled bore.
And now farewell, ye heavenly habitants !
Ye islands, and ye continents of earth !
And thou, 0 main ! of briny wave profound!
O sweet of speech, Olympian Muses !
born From aegis-bearer Jove, sing now the tribe
Of goddesses, whoe'er, by mortals clasped In love, have borne a race resembling gods... .
Ceres, divinest goddess, in soft joy Blends with Iäsius brave, in the rich tract Of Crete, whose fallow'd glebe thrice-till'd abounds ;
And Plutus bore, all-bountiful, who roams Earth, and th' expanded surface of the sea;
And him that meets him on his way, whose hands
He grasps, him gifts he with abundant gold, And large felicity.
Harmonia, born Of golden Venus, gave to Cadmus' love Ino and Semele, and fair of cheek Agave, and Autonoë, the bride Of Aristæus with the clustering locks, And Polydorus, born in towery Thebes.
Aurora to Tythonus Memnon bore, The brazen-helm'd, the Æthiopian king, And king Hemathion ;
and to Cephalus Bore she a son illustrious, Phaeton, Gallantly brave, a mortal like to gods.
Whom while a youth, e'en in the tender flower
Of glorious prime, a boy, and vers'd alone
In what a boy may know, love's amorous queen Snatch'd with swift rape away, and in her fane Sacred, appointed as her nightly priest, And genius of her sanctuary, divine.
Jason Æsonides, by heaven's high will, Bore from Æetes, foster-son of Jove, His daughter ;
those afflictive toils achieved, Which Pelias mighty monarch, bold in wrong, Unrighteous, violent of deed, imposed :
And much-enduring reach'd th' Iolchian coast, Wafting in winged bark the jet-eyed maid His blooming spouse.
She yielding thus in love To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore Medeus, whom the son of Philyra, Sage Chiron, midst the mountain-solitudes Train'd up to man:
thus were high Jove's designs *Fulfill'd.
Now Psamathe, the goddess fam'd
Who sprang from ancient Nereus of the sea, Bore Phocus;
through the golden queen of love By Æacus embraced.
To Peleus' arms Resigned, the silver-footed Thetis bore Achilles lion-hearted, cleaving fierce
The ranks of men.
Wreathed Cytherea bore AEneas ;
blending in ecstatic love With brave Anchises, on the verdant top Of Ida, wood-embosom'd, many-val'd.
Now Circe, from the Sun Hyperion-born Descended, with the much-enduring man Ulysses blending love, Latinus brave, Blameless, and Agrius bore:
who left remote Their native seats in Circe's hallowed isles, And o'er the Tyrrhene tribes illustrious reigned.
Calypso noble midst the goddess race Clasp'd wise Ulysses:
and from rapturous love Nausithous and Nausinous gave to day.
Lo, these were they, who yielding to embrace
Of mortal men, themselves immortal, gave A race resembling gods.
O now the tribe
Of gentle women sing!
Olympian maids !
Ye Muses, born from aegis-bearer Jove II.
The arrival of Alcmena at Thebes as the companion of her hurband's.
exile.
The expedition of Amphitryon against the Teloboans.
The artifice of Jupiter, who anticipates his return, and steals the embraces of Alcmena.
The birth of Hercules.
II.
The meeting of Hercules with Cygnus.
The description of his armour, and particularly of THE SHIELD, diversified with sculptured imagery.OR as Alcmena, from Electryon born, The guardian of his people, her lov'd home And natal soil abandoning, to Thebes Came with Amphitryon, with the brave in war.
She all the gentle race of womankind
In height surpassed and beauty:
nor with her Might one in prudence vie, of all who sprang From mortal fair-ones, blending in embrace With mortal men:
both from her tressed head, And from the darkening lashes of her eyes, She breath'd enamouring fragrance, like the breath Of love's all-charming goddess:
fair she was, But not the less her consort with heart-love Rever'd she;
so had never woman lov'd.
Yet he her noble sire by violent strength Had slain, amid those herds the cause of strife, Maddened to sudden rage:
his native soil He left, and thence to the Cadmean state, Shield-bearing tribe, came supplicant:
and there Dwelt with his modest spouse, yet from the joys
Of love estranged :
for might he not the couch Ascend of her the beautiful of feet, Till for the slaughter of her brethren brave His arm had wreak'd revenge, and burn'd with fire
The guilty cities of those warlike men, Taphians and Teloboans.
This the task Assigned;
the gods on high that solemn vow Had witness'd :
-of their anger visitant
In fear he stood, and speeded in all haste T' achieve the mighty feat imposed by Heaven.
Him the Boeotians, gorers of the steed, Who, coveting the war-shout and the shock Of battle, o'er the buckler breathe aloft Their open valour;
him the Locrian race, Close-combating;
and of undaunted soul The Phocians followed:
towering in the van Amphitryon gallant shone, and in his host Gloried.
But other counsel secret wove Within his breast the sire of gods and men—
That both to gods and to th' inventive race
Of man, a great deliverer might arise Sprung from his loins, of plague-repelling fame.
Deep-framing in his inmost soul deceit,
He through the nightly darkness took his way From high Olympus, glowing with the love Of her, the fair-one of the graceful zone.
Swift to the Typhaonian mount he pass'd :
To lofty Phycium thence approach'd;
—sublime
There sitting, the wise counsellor of heaven Revolv'd a work divine.
That self-same night, Of her who stately treads with ample pace
He sought the couch;
and melting in her arms Took there his fill of love.
That self-same night
The host-arousing chief, the mighty deed Performed, in glory to his home returned ;
Nor to the vassals and the shepherd hinds
His footstep bent, before he climb'd the couch
Of his Alcmena:
such inflaming love Seiz'd in the deep recesses of his heart
The chief of thousands.
And as he that scarce Escapes, and yet escapes, from grievous plague
Or the hard-fettering chain, flees free away Joyful,—so struggling through that arduous toil With pain accomplished, wishful, eager, traced The prince his homeward way.
The livelong night He with the modest partner of his bed Embracing lay, and revell'd in delight
The bounteous bliss of love's all-charming queen.
Thus by a god and by the first of men
Alike subdued to love, Alcmena gave Twin-brethren birth, within the seven-fold gates Of Thebes :
yet brethren though they were, unlike Their natures;
this of weaker strain, but that Far more of man, valorous, and stern, and strong.
Him, Hercules, conceived she from th' embrace
Of the cloud-darkener:
to th' Alcaean chief, Shaker of spears, gave Iphiclus:
a race Distinct;
nor wonder:
this of mortal man, That of imperial Jove;
the same that slew The lofty-minded Cygnus, born from Mars.
For in the grove of the far-darting god He found him ;
and insatiable of war His father Mars beside.
Both bright in arms, Bright as the sheen of burning flame, they stood
On their high chariot;
and the horses fleet Trampled the ground with rending hoofs:
around In parted circle smok'd the cloudy dust, Up-dash'd beneath the trampling hoofs, and cars Of complicated frame.
The well-framed cars Rattled aloud;
loud clashed the wheels;
while rapt
In their full speed the horses flew.
Rejoiced
The noble Cygnus;
for the hope was his, Jove's warlike offspring and his charioteer To slay, and strip them of their gorgeous mail.
But to his vows the Prophet-god of day Turned a deaf ear;
for he himself set on Th' assault of Hercules.
Now all the grove, And Phœbus' altar, flash'd with glimmering arms
Of that tremendous god;
himself blaz'd light, And darted radiance from his eyeballs glar'd
As it were flame.
But who of mortal mould
Had e'er endur'd in daring opposite
To rush before him, save but Hercules, And Ioläns, an illustrious name ?
For mighty force was theirs, and hands of strength Outstretch'd in valour unapproachable;
-
He therefore thus bespake his charioteer:
" 0 hero Ioläus!
dearest far
To me, of all the race of mortal men ;
I deem it sure that 'gainst the blest of heaven Amphitryon sinn'd, when to the fair-wall'd Thebcs He came, forsaking Tirynth's well-built walls, Electryon midst the strife of wide-brow'd herds Slain by his hand:
to Creon suppliant came, And her of flowing robe, Henioche;
Who straight embraced, and all of needful aid Lent hospitable, as to suppliant due:
And more for this, e'en from the heart they gave All honour and observance.
So he liv'd Exulting in his beauteous-ankled spouse Alcmena:
when rolled round the rapid year, We, far unlike in stature and in soul, Were born, thy sire and I:
him Jove bereav'd Of wisdom ;
who from his parental home Went forth, and to the fell Eurystheus bore His homage.
Wretch !
for he most sure bewail'd
In after-time that grievous fault, the which Irrevocable is.
On me has Fate Laid heavy labours.
But, 0 friend !
0 now Quick snatch the crimson reins of these my steeds
Rapid of hoof;
the manly courage rouse Within thee:
now with strong unerring grasp
Guide the swift chariot's whirl, and wind the steeds Rapid of hoof:
fear nought the dismal yell
Of mortal-slayer Mars, whilst to and fro He ranges fierce Apollo's hallow'd grove With phrensying shout:
for, be he as he may War-mighty, he of war shall take his fill.
"Then answered Ioläus:
" 0 rever'd !
Doubtless the father of the gods and men
Thy head delights to honour;
and the god Who keeps the wall of Thebes, and guards her towers, Bull-visag'd Neptune:
so be sure they give Unto thy hand this mortal strong and huge.
That from the conflict thou mayst bear away High glory.
But now haste-in warlike mail Dress now thy limbs, that, rapidly as thought Mingling the shock of cars, we may be join'd In battle.
He th' undaunted son of Jove Shall strike not with his terrors, nor yet me Iphiclides:
but swiftly, as I deem, Shall he to flight betake him, from the race Of brave Alcaeus ;
who now pressing nigh Gain on their foes, and languish for the shout Of closing combat;
to their eager ear More grateful than the banquet's revelry.
"He said;
and Hercules smil'd stern his joy Elate of thought:
for he had spoken words Most welcome.
Then with winged accents thus:
" Jove-foster'd hero!
it is e'en at hand,
The battle's rough encounter;
thou, as erst, In martial prudence firm, aright, aleft, With 'vantage of the fray, unerring guide Anon huge, the sable-maned, and me Aid in the doubtful contest as thou mayst.
"Thus having said, his legs he sheath'd in greaves
Of mountain-brass, resplendent-white;
the gift Glorious of Vulcan:
o'er his breast lie drew The corselet, variegated, beautiful, Of shining gold;
this Jove-born Pallas gave.
When first he rush'd to meet the mingling groans
Of battle, then the mighty man athwart
His shoulder slung the sword whose edge repels
Th' approach of mortal harms:
and clasp'd around His bosom, and reclining o'er his back, He cast the hollow quiver;
lurk'd therein Full many arrows;
shuddering horror they Inflicted, and the agony of death Sudden, that chokes the suffocative voice:
The points were barb'd with death, and bitter steep'd
In human tears:
burnish'd the lengthening shafts;
And they were feather'd from the tawny plume
Of eagles.
Now he grasp'd the solid spear Sharpen'd with brass;
and on his brows of strength Placed the forg'd helm, high-wrought in adamant, That cas'd the temples round, and fenc'd the head Divine.
His hands then rais'd THE SHIELD, of disk Diversified;
might none with missile aim Pierce, or th' impenetrable substance rive Shattering.
A wondrous frame;
since all throughout Bright with enamel, and with ivory, And mingled metal;
and with ruddy gold Refulgent, and with azure plates inlaid.
The scaly terror of a dragon coil'd Full in the central field;
unspeakable;
With eyes oblique retorted, that aslant Shot gleaming flame;
his hollow jaw was fill'd Dispersedly with jagged fangs of white, Grim, unapproachable.
And next above
The dragon's forehead fell, stern Strife in air Hung hovering, and array'd the war of men :
Haggard;
whose aspect from all mortals reft All mind and soul, whoe'er in brunt of arms
Should match their strength, and face the son of Jove, Below this earth their spirits to th' abyss Descend;
and through the flesh that wastes away Beneath the parching sun, their whitening bones Start forth, and moulder in the sable dust.
Pursuit was there, and fiercely rallying Flight, Tumult and Terror :
burning Carnage glow'd ;
Wild Discord madden'd there, and frantic Rout Ranged to and fro.
A deathful Destiny
There grasp'd a living man, that bled afresh From recent wound ;
another yet unharm'd Dragged furious ;
and a third already dead Trail'd by the feet amid the throng of war And o'er her shoulders was a garment thrown, Dabbled with human blood;
and in her look Was horror;
and a deep funereal cry Broke from her lips.
There, indescribable, Twelve serpent heads rose dreadful;
and with fear Froze all who drew on earth the breath of life, Whoe'er should match their strength in brunt of arms, And face the son of Jove:
and oft as lie Mov'd to the battle, from their clashing fangs A sound was heard.
Such miracles displayed
The buckler's field, with living blazonry Resplendent:
and those fearful snakes were streak'd
O'er their cœrulean backs with streaks of jet;
And their jaws blacken'd with a jetty dye.
Wild from the forest, herds of boars were there, And lions, mutual glaring;
and in wrath Leap'd on each other;
and by troops they drove
Their onset:
nor yet these nor those recoil'd, Nor quak'd in fear :
of both the backs uprose Bristling with anger:
for a lion huge Lay stretched amidst them, and two boars beside Lifeless ;
the sable blood down-dropping ooz'd Into the ground.
So these with bowed backs
Lay dead beneath the terrible lions :
they, For this the more incensed, both savage boars
And tawny lions, chafing sprang to war.
There, too, the battle of the Lapithæ Was wrought;
the spear-arm'd warriors:
Cæneus king, Hopleus, Phalerus, and Pirithous, And Dryas and Exadius ;
Prolochus, Mopsus of Titaressa, Ampyx' son, A branch of Mars, and Theseus like a god:
Son of Ægéus:
—silver were their limbs, Their armour golden:
and to them opposed The Centaur band stood thronging:
Asbolus, Prophet of birds, Petraeus huge of height, Arctus, and Urius, and of raven locks Mimas:
the two Peucidæ, Dryalus, And Perimedes;
all of silver frame, And grasping golden pine-trees in their hands.
At once they onset made ;
in very life
They rush'd, and hand to hand tumultuous clos'd With pines and clashing spears.
There fleet of hoof
The steeds were standing of stern-visag'd Mars In gold :
and he himself, tearer of spoils, Life-waster, purpled all with dropping blood, As one who slew the living and despoiled, Loud-shouting to the warrior-infantry There vaulted on his chariot:
him beside Stood Fear and Consternation;
high their hearts Panted, all eager for the war of men.
There too Minerva rose, leader of hosts, Resembling Pallas when she would array
The marshall'd battle.
In her grasp her spear, And on her brows a golden helm ;
athwart Her shoulders thrown her ægis;
went she forth In this array to meet the dismal shout Of war.
And there a tuneful choir appeared
Of heaven's immortals:
in the midst, the son Of Jove and of Latona sweetly rang Upon his golden harp;
th' Olympian mount, Dwelling of gods, thrilled back the broken sound.
And there were seen th' assembly of the gods Listening :
encircled with beatitude :
And in sweet contest with Apollo there The virgins of Pieria raised the strain Preluding ;
and they seem'd as though they sang With clear sonorous voice.
And there appeared A sheltering haven from the rage untam'd Of ocean.
It was wrought of tin, refin'd, And rounded by the chisel;
and it seem'd
Like to the dashing wave :
and in the midst
Full many dolphins chas'd the fry, and showed
As though they swam the waters, to and fro Darting tumultuous.
Two of silver scale, Panting above the wave, the fishes mute Gorg'd, that beneath them shook their quivering fins
In brass:
but on the crag a fisher sat Observant;
in his grasp he held a net, Like one that poising rises to the throw.
There was the knight of fair-hair'd Danaë born, Perseus:
nor yet the buckler with his feet Touch'd, nor yet distant hover'd:
strange to think *
For nowhere on the surface of the shield
He rested:
so the crippled artist-god Illustrious, framed him with his hands in gold.
Bound to his feet were sandals wing'd :
a sword
Of brass, with hilt of sable ebony, Hung round him by the shoulders from a thong.
Swift e'en as thought he flew.
The visage grim Of monstrous Gorgon all his back o'erspread ;
And wrought in silver, wondrous to the sight, A veil was drawn around it, whence in gold Hung glittering fringes :
and the dreadful helm Of Pluto clasp'd the temples of the prince, Shedding a night of darkness.
Thus outstretcht
In air, he seem'd like one to trembling flight Betaken.
Close behind, the Gorgons twain, Of nameless terror, unapproachable, Came rushing :
eagerly they stretched their arms
To seize him :
from the pallid adamant Audibly as they rush'd, the clattering shield Clank'd with a sharp shrill sound:
two grisly snakes Hung from their girdles, and with forking tongues Lick'd their inflected jaws :
and violent gnash'd
Their fangs, fell-glaring :
each grim Gorgon head Shook horror.
Next above them warrior men Wag'd battle, grasping weapons in their hands.
Some from their city and their sires repell'd Destruction ;
others hastened to destroy :
And many press'd the plain, but more still held
The combat.
On the strong-constructed towers Stood women, shrieking shrill, and rent their cheeks
In very life, by Vulcan's glorious craft.
The elders hoar with age assembled stood Without the gates, and to the blessed gods
Their hands uplifted, for their fighting sons Fear-stricken.
These again the combat held.
Behind them stood the Fates, of aspect black, Grim, slaughter-breathing, fell, insatiable, With teeth white-gnashing;
and fierce conflict held For those who fell.
Each eager-thirsting sought To quaff the sable blood.
Whom first they snatch'd Prostrate, or staggering with the fresh-made wound, On him they struck their talons huge :
the soul Fled down th' abyss, the horror-freezing gulf Of Tartarus.
They, glutted to the heart With human gore, behind them cast the corse ;
And back with hurrying rage they turned to seek
The throng of battle.
And hard by there stood Clotho and Lachesis ;
and Atropos, Somewhat in years inferior ;
nor was she A mighty goddess, yet those other Fates Exceeding, and of birth the elder far.
And all around one man in cruel strife
Were join'd ;
and on each other turned in wrath
Their glowing eyes ;
and mingling desperate hands
And talons, mutual strove.
And near to them Stood Misery, wan, ghastly, worn with woe ;
Arid and swoln of knees, with hunger's pains Faint-falling :
from her lean hands long the nails Outgrew ;
an ichor from her nostrils flowed ;
Blood from her cheeks distill'd to earth ;
with teeth
All wide disclosed in grinning agony
She stood :
a cloud of dust her shoulders spread, And her eyes ran with tears.
But next arose A well-tower'd city, by seven golden gates Enclosed, that fitted to their lintels hung.
There men in dances and in festive joys Held revelry.
Some on the smooth-wheel'd car A virgin bride conducted :
then burst forth
Aloud the marriage-song ;
and far and wide Long splendours flash'd from many a quivering torch Borne in the hands of slaves.
Gay-blooming girls Preceded, and the dancers foliow'd blithe :
These, with shrill pipe indenting the soft lip, Breath'd melody, while broken echoes thrill'd Around them ;
to the lyre with flying touch
Those led the love-enkindling dance.
A group
Of youths was elsewhere imag'd, to the flute Disporting :
some in dances and in song, In laughter others.
To the minstrel's flute
So pass'd they on ;
and the whole city seem'd
As fill'd with pomps, with dances, and with feasts.
Others again, without the city-walls, Vaulted on steeds, and madden'd for the goal.
Others as husbandmen appeared, and broke With coulter the rich glebe, and gathered up
Their tunics neatly girded.
Next arose A field thick-set with depth of corn ;
where some
With sickle reaped the stalks, their speary heads Bent, as with pods weighed down of swelling grain;
The fruits of Ceres.
Others into bands Gathered, and threw upon the thrashing-floor The sheaves.
And some again hard by were seen Holding the vine-sickle, who clusters cut From the ripe vines, which from the vintagers Others in frails received, or bore away In baskets thus up-pil'd the clustered grapes, Or black, or pearly white, cut from deep ranks
Of spreading vines, whose tendrils curling twin'd
In silver, heavy-foliag'd:
near them rose
The ranks of vines, by Vulcan's curious craft Figured in gold.
The vines leaf-shaking curl'd Round silver props.
They therefore on their way Passed jocund, to one minstrel's flageolet, Burden'd with grapes that blackened in the sun.
Some also trod the wine-press, and some quaff'd
The foaming must.
But in another part
Were men who wrestled, or in gymnic fight Wielded the cæstus.
Elsewhere men of chase
Were taking the fleet hares ;
two keen-tooth'd dogs Bounded beside :
these ardent in pursuit, Those with like ardour doubling on their flight.
Next them were knights, who painful effort made
To win the prize of contest and hard toil.
High o'er the well-compacted chariots hung
The charioteers ;
the rapid horses loos'd
At their full stretch, and shook the floating reins.
Rebounding from the ground with many a shock Flew clattering the firm cars, and creak'd aloud
The naves of the round wheels.
They therefore toil'd Endless ;
nor conquest yet at any time Achieved they, but a doubtful strife maintained.
In the mid-course the prize, a tripod huge, Was placed in open sight, in sculpt of gold :
—
These glorious works had Vulcan artful wrought.
Rounding the uttermost verge the ocean flow'd
As in full swell of waters :
and the shield All-variegated with whole circle bound.
Swans of high-hovering wing there clamoured shrill, Who also skimm'd the breasted surge with plume Innumerous:
near them fishes midst the waves Frolic'd in wanton leaps.
Marvellous the sight E'en to the Thunderer's eyes, by whose dread will Had Vulcan framed the vast and solid shield.
This fitting to his grasp, the valiant son Of Jove with ease now shook, and vaulting rose Into the steed-rapt chariot;
with light bound, Swift as the flash of his Egean sire Up-springing :
and his hardy charioteer Stood o'er the steeds from high, and guided strong
The crooked car.
Now near to them approach'd Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, and addressed These winged words in animating voice:
" Offspring of Lyngeus wide renowned, all-hail !
Now verily the ruler of the blest, E'en Jove, doth give you strength to spoil of life Cygnus your foe, and strip his gorgeous arms.
But I will breathe a word within thy ear
Of counsel, 0 most mighty midst the strong !
Now soon as e'er from Cygnus thou hast reft
The sweets of life, there leave him ;
on that spot, Him and his armour:
but th' approach of Mars, Slayer of mortals, watch with wary eye ;
And where thy glance discerns a part exposed Defenceless of the well-wrought buckler, strike !
With thy sharp point there wound him, and recede:
For know, thor art not fated to despoil
The steeds and glorious armour uf a god.
"Thus having said, the goddess all divine.
Aye-holding in her everlasting hands Conquest and glory, rose into the car Impetuous:
to the war-steeds shouted fierce
The noble Ioläus:
from the shout
They starting rapt the flying car, and hid With dusty cloud the plain :
for she herself,
The goddess azure-eyed, sent into them Wild courage, clanging on her brandish'd shield :
Earth groan'd around.
That moment with like pace E'en as a flame or tempest came they on, Cygnus the tamer of the steed, and Mars Unsated with the roar of war.
And now The coursers midway met, and face to face Neigh'd shrill:
the broken echoes rang around.
Then him the first strong Hercules bespake :
" 0 soft of nature!
why dost thou obstruct
The rapid steeds of men, who toils have proved And hardships ?
Outward turn thy burnished car ;
Pass outward from the track, and yield the way :
For I to Trachys ride, of obstacle Impatient;
to the royal Ceyx :
he O'er Trachys rules in venerable power, As needs not thee be told, who hast to wife His blue-eyed daughter Themisthonöe :
— Soft-one !
for not from thee shall Mars himself Inhibit death, if truly hand to hand
We wage the battle :
and e'en this I say, That elsewhere heretofore himself has proved
My mighty spear;
when, on the sandy beach Of Pylos, ardour irrepressible Of combat seiz'd him, and to me oppos'd
He stood:
but thrice when stricken by my lance Earth propped his fall, and thrice his targe was cleft:
The fourth time urging on my utmost force
His ample shield I shattering riv'd, his thigh Transpierced, and headlong in the dust he fell Beneath my rushing spear :
-so there the weight Fell on him of reproach midst those of heaven, His gory trophies leaving to these hands.
"So said he.
But in no wise to obey Enter'd the thought of Cygnus the spear skill'd ;
Nor rein'd he back the chariot-whirling steeds.
Then truly from their close-compacted cars Instant as thought they leap'd to earth-the son Of kingly Mars, the son of mighty Jove.
Aside, though not remote, the charioteers
The coursers drove of flowing manes.
But then Beneath the trampling sound of rushing feet
The broad earth sounded hollow:
and as rocks
From some high mountain-top precipitate Leap with a bound, and o'er each other whirled Shock in the dizzying fall;
and many an oak
Of lofty branch, pine-tree, and poplar deep
Of root, are crashed beneath them, as their course Rapidly rolls, until they reach the plain-
So met these foes encountering, and so burst
Their mighty clamour.
Echoing loud throughout
The city of the Myrmidons gave back
Their lifted voices ;
and Iolchos fam'd, And Arne, and Anthea herbage-crown'd, And Helice :
thus with amazing shout They joined in battle.
All-consulting Jove
Then greatly thundered:
from the clouds of heaven
He cast forth dews of blood, and signal thus Of onset gave to his high-daring son.
As in the mountain thickets the wild boar, Grim to behold and arm'd with jutting fangs, Now with his hunters meditates in wrath
The conflict, whetting his white tusk oblique;
Foam drops around his champing jaws;
his eyes Show like to glimmering fires, and o'er his neck
And horrent back he raises up erect
The starting bristles ;
-from the chariot, whirled By steeds of war, such leaped the son of Jove.
'T was in that season when, on some green bough High-perch'd, the dusky-wing'd cicada first Shrill chants to man a summer note;
his drink, His balmy food the vegetative dew:
The livelong day from early dawn he pours
His voice, what time the sun's exhaustive heat Fierce dries the frame:
—'Twas in the season when The bristly ears of millet spring with grain
Which they in summer sow;
when the crude grape Faint reddens on the vine, which Bacchus gave, The joy or anguish of the race of men;
— E'en in that season join'd the war, and vast
The battle's tumult rose into the heaven.
As two grim lions for a roebuck slain Wroth in contention rush, and them betwixt
The sound of roaring and of clashing teeth Ariseth;
or as vultures, curv'd of beak, Crooked of talon, on a steepy rock Contest, loud-screaming, if perchance below Some mountain-pastur'd goat or forest-stag Sleek press the plain, whom far the hunter-youth Pierc'd with fleet arrow from the bowstring shrill Dismissed, but elsewhere wander'd of the spot Unknowing;
they with keenest heed the prize Mark, and in swooping rage each other tear With bitterest conflict;
—so vociferous rush'd
The warriors on each other.
Truly then Cygnus, the son of Jove unmatched in strength Aiming to slay, against the buckler struck
His brazen lance-but through the metal plate Broke not:
the present of a god preserved.
On th' other side he of Amphitryon nam'd Strong Hercules, between the helm and shield Drove his long spear, and underneath the chin Through the bare neck smote violent and swift.
The murderous ashen beam at once the nerves Twain of the neck cleft sheer;
for all the man Dropped, and his force went from him :
down he fell Headlong.
As falls a thunder-blasted oak, Or perpendicular rock, riven by the flash Of Jove, in smouldering smoke is hurl'd from high, So fell he;
and his brass-emblazon'd mail Clattered around him.
Him the son of Jove, Stout-hearted, there abandoned where he lay:
But wary watch'd the mortal-slayer god Approach, and view'd him o'er with terrible eyes Stern-lowering.
As a lion who has fall'n Perchance on some stray beast, with griping claws Intent strips down the lacerated hide;
Drains instantaneous the sweet life, and gluts E'en to the fill his gloomy heart with blood;
Green-eyed he glares in fierceness;
with his tail Lashes his shoulders and his swelling sides, And with his feet tears up the ground ;
not one Might dare to look upon him, nor advance Nigh, with design of conflict ;
-such in truth
The war-insatiate Hercules to Mars Stood in array, and gathered in his soul Prompt courage.
But the other near approached, Anguish'd at heart;
and both encountering rush'd With cries of battle.
As when from high ridge
Of some hill-top abrupt, tumbles a crag Precipitous, and sheer a giddy space Bounds in a whirl and rolls impetuous down;
Shrill rings the vehement crash, till some steep cliff Obstructs;
to this the mass is borne along, This wedges it immoveable ;
—e'en so Destroyer Mars, bender of chariots, rush'd Yelling vociferous with a shout:
e'en so As utterance prompt met Hercules the shock, And firm sustained.
But Jove-born Pallas came With darkening shield uplifted, and to Mars Stood interposed;
and, scowling with her eyes Tremendous, thus addressed her winged words:
" Mars !
hold thy furious valour;
stay those hands
In prowess inaccessible;
for know, It is not lawful for thee to divest Slain Hercules of these his glorious arms, Bold-hearted son of Jove:
but come;
rest thou From battle, nor oppose thyself to me.
"She said;
nor yet persuaded aught the soul Of Mars, the mighty of heart.
With a great shout, He, brandishing his weapon like a flame, Sprang rapid upon Hercules, in haste To slay:
and, for his slaughtered son incensed, With violent effort hurl'd his brazen spear 'Gainst the capacious targe.
The blue-eyed maid Stoop'd from the chariot, and the javelin's force Turn'd wide.
Sore torment seiz'd the breast of Mars;
He bar'd his keen-edg'd falchion, and at once Rush'd on the dauntless Hercules:
but he, The war-insatiate, as the god approached, Beneath the well-wrought shield the thigh exposed Wounded with all his strength, and thrusting riv'd
The shield's large disk, and cleft it with his lance, And in the middle-way threw him to earth Prostrate.
But Fear and Consternation swift Urg'd near his well-wheeled chariot:
from the face
Of broad-track'd earth they rais'd him on the car Variously-fram'd;
thence lash'd with scourge the steeds
And bounding up the vast Olympus flew.
Alcmena's mighty son and his compeer, Fam'd Ioläus, now that they had stripped From Cygnus' shoulders in triumphant spoil
The armour elegant, forthwith returned Upon their way direct, and instant reach'd
The towers of Trachys with their fleet-hoofd steeds:
And azure-eyed Minerva sought the vast Olympus, and the mansions of her sire,But Ceyx o'er the corse of Cygnus rais'd A tomb.
Innumerable people grac'd His obsequies:
both they who dwelt hard by The city of th' illustrious king;
and they Of Anthe, of Iolchos wide-renown'd, Of Arne, of the Myrmidonian towers, And Helice.
So gathered there around A numerous people ;
honouring duteous thus Ceyx, beloved of the blessed gods.
But the huge mount and monumental stone Anaurus, foaming high with wintry rains, Swept from the sight away.
Latous this Commanded, for that Cygnus ambush'd spoil'd
In violence the Delphic hecatombs.
The Exordium is a rhapsody in praise of Jupiter.
The poem comprehend!
the general economy of Industry and Morals.
In the first division of the subject the state of the world past and present is described, for the pur­ pose of exemplifying the condition of human nature;
which entails on man the necessity of exertion to procure the goods of life ;
and leaves him no alternative but honest industry or unjust violence;
of which the good and evil consequences are respectively illustrated.
Two STRIFES are said to have been sent into the world, the one promoting Dissension, the other Emulation.
Perses is exhorted to abjure the former and embrace the latter:
and an apposite allusion is made to the circumstance of his litigiously disputing the patrimonial estate, of which through the corrup­ tion of the judges he obtained the larger proportion.
The judges are re­ buked, and cheap contentment is apostrophized as the true secret of hap­ piness.
Such is stated to have been the original sense of mankind before the necessity of labour existed.
The origin of labour is deduced from the resentment of Jupiter against Prometheus;
which resentment led to the creation of PANDORA, or WomAN ;
who is described with her attributes, and is represented as bringing into the world a casket of evils.
The de­ generacy of man is then traced through successive ages.
The three first ages are respectively distinguished as golden, silver, and brazen.
The fourth has no metallic distinction, but is described as the heroic age, and as embracing the æra of the Trojan war.
The fifth is styled the iron age, and, according to the poet, is that in which he lives.
The general corrup­ tion of mankind in this age is detailed, and Modesty and Justice are represented as taking their flight to heaven.
A pointed allusion to the corrupt administration of the laws in his own particular instance is intro­ duced in a fable typical of oppression.
Justice is described as invisibly following those who violate her decrees with avenging power, and as lamenting in their streets the wickedness of a corrupted people.
The temporal blessings of an upright nation are contrasted with -the temporal evils which a wicked nation draws down from an angry Providence.
Holy Daemons are represented as walking the earth, and keeping watch over the actions of men.
Justice is again introduced as carrying her com­ plaints to the feet of Jupiter, and as obtaining that the crimes of rulers be visited on their people.
A pathetic appeal is then made to these rulers, in their judicial capacity, to forsake injustice.
After some further exhorta­ tions to virtue and industry, and a number of unconnected precepts, the poet enters on the GEORGICAL part of his subject;
which contains the prognostics of the seasons of agricultural labour, and rules appertaining to wood-felling, carpentry, ploughing, sowing, reaping, thrashing, vine- dressing, and the vintage.
This division of the subject includes a descrip­ tion of Winter and of a repast in Summer.
The poet then treats of navigation;
and concludes with some desultory precepts of religion, morality, and superstition:
and lastly, with a specification of DAYS ;
which are divided into holy, auspicious and inauspicious, mixed, and in­ termediary, or such as are entitled to no remarkable observance.
COME from Pieria, Muses !
that inspire
The song of praise;
the theme your heavenly Sire;
By his dread best alike are mortals found Obscure, illus rious, fameless, and renown'd:
With equal ease the Ruler of the sky
The humble lifts, and casts the proud from high:
With ease eclipses glory's dazzling ray, With ease on abject darkness pours the day:
And bows the strong in might of their renown Withered to dust, and rears the bowed down:
E'en he, the god whose mansions are above, High-thundering from the clouds, imperial Jove:
Now bend thine eyes from heaven, incline thy ear The ways of judgment guide ;
behold and hear!
While fain to Perses would my voice essay
The lore of truth, and breathe th' instructive lay.
Two Strifes on earth of soul divided rove;
This will the wise condemn, and that approve.
Deadly the one diffuses evil far, Enkindling discord and arousing war:
Men love not this ;
yet heaven-enfore'd maintain The Strife abhorr'd, but still abhorred in vain.
The other sprang of elder birth to light From the dark bosom of parental Night:
The god who dwells in ether, thron'd on high, Sent down this elder offspring from the sky;
And plac'd on nether earth amid mankind
This better Strife, which fires the slothful mind.
The needy idler sees the wealth of toil, Hastes to the plough, and plants himself the soil:
Orders his household ;
and with zealous eyes Views him who speeds to wealth, and toils to rise:
Beneficent this better envy burns;
Thus emulous his wheel the potter turns;
The smith his anvil beats ;
the beggar-throng Industrious ply;
the bards contest in song.
O Perses !
thou within thy secret breast
Repose the maxims by my care imprest;
Nor ever let that evil-joying strife
Have power to wean thee from the toils of life:
The whilst thy prying eyes the forum draws, Thine ears the process, and the din of laws :
Small care be his of wrangling and debate
For whose ungather'd food the garners wait:
Who wants within the summer's plenty stor'd, Earth's kindly fruits, and Ceres' yearly hoard:
With these replenish'd, at the brawling bar For others' wealth go instigate the war:
But this thou mayst no more:
let Justice guide, Best boon of heaven, and future strife decide.
Not so we shar'd the patrimonial land, When greedy pillage fill'd thy grasping hand :
The bribe-devouring judges sooth'd by thee The sentence will'd, and stamp'd the false decree ;
O fools and blind!
to whose misguided soul Unknown how far the half exceeds the whole ;
Unknown the good that healthful mallows yield, And asphodel, the dainties of the field.
The food of man in deep concealment lies, The angry gods have veil'd it from our eyes:
Else had one day bestow'd sufficient cheer, And though inactive fed thee through the year.
Then might thy hand have laid the rudder by, In blackening smoke for ever hung on high;
Then had the labours of the ox been o'er, And the toil-patient mule had toil'd no more.
But Jove our food concealed :
Prometheus' art With fraud illusive had incens'd his heart:
Sore ills to man devis'd the heavenly Sire, And hid the shining element of fire.
Prometheus then, benevolent of soul, In hollow reed the spark recovering stole:
And thus the god beguil'd, whose awful gaze Serene rejoices in the lightning's blaze."
0 son of Japhet with indignant heart Spake the cloud-gatherer, "0 unmatch'd in art I Exultest thou in this the flame retrieved, And dost thou triumph in the god deceived ?
But thou with the posterity of man
Shalt rue the fraud whence mightier ills began:
This fire shall draw perdition on the race, And all enamour'd shall their bane embrace.
"The Sire who rules the earth and sways the pole Had said, and laughter fill'd his secret soul:
He bade the crippled god his best obey, And mould with tempering water plastic clay;
With human nerve and human voice invest
The limbs elastic and the breathing breast;
Fair as the blooming goddesses above, A virgin's likeness with the looks of love.
He bade Minerva teach the skill that sheds A thousand colours in the gliding threads:
He call'd the magic of love's golden queen
To breathe around a witchery of mien ;
And eager passion's never-sated flame, And cares of dress that prey upon the frame;
Bade Hermes last endue with craft refin'd
Of treacherous manners, and a shameless mind.
He gives command, th' inferior powers obey:
The crippled artist moulds the tempered clay:
By Jove's design arose the bashful maid ;
The cestus Pallas clasp'd, the robe array'd:
Ador'd Persuasion and the Graces young Her taper'd limbs with golden jewels hung:
Round her fair brow the lovely-tressed Hours A garland twin'd of spring's purpureal flowers:
The whole attire Minerva's graceful art Dispos'd, adjusted, form'd to every part:
And last the winged herald of the skies, Slayer of Argus, gave delusive lies ;
Insidious manners, honey'd speech instill'd, And warbling accents, as the Thund'rer will'd ;
Then by the feathered messenger of heaven
The name Pandora to the maid was given ;
For all the gods conferred a gifted grace
To crown this mischief of the mortal race.
The Sire commands the winged herald bear
The finish'd nymph, th' inextricable snare:
To Epimetheus was the present brought, Prometheus' warning vanish'd from his thought-
That he disclaim each offering from the skies, And straight restore, lest ill to man arise.
But he received ;
and conscious knew too late Th' insidious gift, and felt the curse of fate.
Whilom on earth the sons of men abode From evil free and labour's galling load;
Free from diseases that with racking rage Precipitate the pale decline of age.
Now swift the days of manhood haste away, And misery's pressure turns the temples gray.
The woman's hands an ample casket bear;
-
She lifts the lid,—she scatters ills in air.
Hope sole remain'd within, nor took her flight, Beneath the casket's verge concealed from sight.
Th' unbroken cell with closing lid the maid Seal'd, and the cloud-assembler's voice obey'd.
Issued the rest in quick dispersion hurl'd,
And woes innumerous roam'd the breathing world:
With ills the land is rife, with ills the sea;
Diseases haunt our frail humanity:
Self-wandering through the noon, the night they glide, Voiceless-a voice the power all-wise denied.
Know then this awful truth ;
It is not given T' elude the wisdom of omniscient Heaven.
Now listen other lore of skilful art And pleasing power, and grave it on thy heart.
When gods alike and mortals rose to birth, A golden race th' immortals form'd on earth
Of many-languag'd men:
they liv'd of old, When Saturn reign'd in heaven-an age of gold.
Like gods they liv'd, with calm untroubled mind, Free from the toil and anguish of our kind.
Nor sad decrepit age approaching nigh
Their limbs mishap'd with swoln deformity.
Strangers to it!, they Nature's banquets prov'd, Rich in earth's fruits, and of the blest belov'd:
They sank to death, as opiate slumber stole Soft o'er the sense, and whelm'd the willing soul.
Theirs was each good:
the grain-exuberant soil Pour'd the full harvest, uncompell'd by toil:
The virtuous many dwelt in common blest, And all unenvying shar'd what all in peace possess'd.
When on this race the verdant earth had lain, By Jove's high will they rose a Genii train :
Earth-wandering daemons they their charge began, The ministers of good and guards of man :
Veil'd with a mantle of aerial night, O'er earth's wide space they wing their hovering flight;
Dispense the fertile treasures of the ground, And bend their all-observant glance around ;
To mark the deed unjust, the just approve, Their kingly office, delegate from Jove.
Then form'd the gods a second race of man, Degenerate far, and silver years began:
Unlike the mortals of a golden kind, Unlike in frame of limbs and mould of mind.
Yet still a hundred years beheld the boy Beneath the mother's roof, her infant joy ;
All tender and unform'd:
but when the flower Of manhood came it wither'd in an hour.
Their frantic follies wrought them pain and woe;
Nor mutual outrage could their hands forego.
Nor fear'd they Heaven;
nor e'er in custom'd rite Bade the dread altars flame with hallow'd light;
Them angry Jove ingulf'd, who dar'd refuse
The gods their glory and their sacred dues:
Yet nam'd the second-blest in earth they lie, And second honours grace their memory.
The Sire of earth and heaven created then A race, the third of many-languag'd men:
Unlike the silver they;
of brazen mould, Strong with the ashen spear, and fiercely bold:
Their thoughts were bent on violence alone, The deeds of battle, and the dying groan :
Bloody their feasts, by wheaten food unblest;
Of adamant was each unyielding breast.
Huge, nerv'd with strength, each hardy giant stands,
And mocks approach with unresisted hands:
Their mansions, implements, and armour shine In brass,-dark iron slept within the mine.
They by each others' hands inglorious fell, In horrid darkness plung'd, the house of hell:
Fierce though they were, their mortal course was run, Death gloomy seiz'd, and snatch'd them from the sun.
Them when th' abyss had covered from the skies, Lo !
the fourth age on nurturing earth arise;
Jove formed the race a better, juster line, A race of heroes and of stamp divine :
Lights of the age that rose before our own, As demi-gods o'er earth's wide regions known.
Yet these dread battle hurried to their end :
Some where the sev'nfold gates of Thebes ascend ;
The Cadmian realm;
where they with fatal might Strove for the flocks of CEdipus in fight:
Some war in navies led to Troy's far shore, O'er the great space of sea their course they bore, For sake of Helen with the beauteous hair, And death for Helen's sake o'erwhelm'd them there.
Them on earth's utmost verge the god assign'd
A life, a seat, distinct from human-kind ;
Beside the deepening whirlpools of the main, In those blest isles where Saturn holds his reign, Apart from heaven's immortals ;
calm they share A rest unsullied by the clouds of care.
And yearly thrice with sweet luxuriance crown'd Springs the ripe harvest from the teeming ground.
Oh would that Nature had denied me birth Midst this fifth race, this iron age of earth;
That long before within the grave I lay, J Or long hereafter could behold the day !
Corrupt the race, with toils and griefs opprest, Nor day nor night can yield a pause of rest:
Still do the gods a weight of care bestow, Though still some good is mingled with the woe.
Jove on this race of many-languag'd man Speeds the swift ruin which but slow began ;
For scarcely spring they to the light of day, Ere age untimely strews their temples gray.
Nor sire with son, with brethren brethren blend, Nor host with guest, nor friend, as erst, with friend:
Reckless of heaven's revenge the sons behold
The hoary parents wax too swiftly old;
And impious point the keen dishonouring tongue, With hard reproofs and bitter mockeries hung:
Nor grateful in declining age repay
The nurturing fondness of their better day.
Now man's right hand is law:
for spoil they wait,
And lay their mutual cities desolate:
Unhonour'd he by whom his oath is fear'd;
Nor are the good beloved, the just rever'd:
With favour grac'd the evil-doer stands, Nor curbs with shame nor equity his hands;
With crooked slanders wounds the virtuous man, And stamps with perjury what hate began.
Lo !
ill-rejoicing Envy, wing'd with lies, Scattering calumnious rumours as she flies, The steps of miserable men pursue, With haggard aspect, blasting to the view.
Till those fair forms in snowy raiment bright
From the broad earth have wing'd their heavenward flight, Call'd to th' eternal synod of the skies, The virgins Modesty and Justice rise:
And leave forsaken man to mourn below The weight of evil, and the cureless woe.
Now unto kings I frame the fabling song, However wisdom unto kings belong.
A stooping hawk with crooked talon smote
The nightingale of variegated note, And snatched among the clouds.
Beneath the stroke
This piteous shrieked and that imperious spoke:
" Wretch !
vain are cries ;
a stronger holds thee now;
Where'er I shape my course a captive thou, Maugre thy song, must company my way;
I rend my banquet or I loose my prey:
Senseless is he that dares with power contend, Defeat, rebuke, despair shall be his end.
"So spake the bird whose wide-spread pinions bear His course impetuous through the yielding air.
But thou, 0 Perses !
heed the moral strain;
To justice cleave, from injury refrain.
For heavy on the poor does injury press,
And e'en the wealthy bend to the distress, And feel the weight of wrong;
be this thy trust;
The better path conducts thee to be just:
Still in the end shall justice wrong subdue;
This fools confess from sore experience true.
With crooked judgments, lo !
the oath's dread god Avenging runs, and tracks them where they trod:
Rough are the ways of justice as the sea, When man perverted wills the false decree;
When to and fro the bribe-devourer draws, As vile corruption sways, the wrested laws.
For them who trembling justice force to fly, For them whose breath decrees iniquity;
Invisible their steps the virgin treads, And mustering evils gather o'er their heads:
She with a veiling cloud her form arrays, And walks in awful grief the city-ways:
Her cry ascends ;
her tear upbraiding falls ;
O'er their stained manners, their devoted walls.
But they who never from the right have stray'd,
Who as the citizen the stranger aid, They and their cities flourish ;
genial Peace Dwells in their borders, and their youth increase:
Nor Jove, whose radiant eyes behold afar, Hangs forth in heaven the signs of grievous war.
Nor scathe nor famine on the righteous prey;
Earth foodful teems, and banquets crown the day:
Rich wave their mountain oaks ;
the topmost tree
The rustling acorn fills, its trunk the murmuring bee.
Burdened with fleece their panting flocks:
the race
Of woman soft reflects the father's face:
Still flourish they, nor tempt with ships the main:
The fruits of earth are pour'd from every plain.
But o'er the wicked race, to whom belong
The thought of evil and the deed of wrong, aturnian Jove, of wide-beholding eyes, Bids the dark signs of retribution rise:
And oft the crimes of one destructive fall, The crimes of one are visited on all.
The god sends down his angry plagues from high, Famine and pestilence ;
in heaps they die.
He smites with barrenness the marriage bed, And generations moulder with the dead.
Again in vengeance of his wrath he falls
On their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls;
Arrests their navies on the watery plain, And whelms their strength with mountains of the main.
Revolve, 0 kings !
within your inmost thought
The retribution by his vengeance wrought:
Invisible the gods are ever nigh, Pass through the midst, and bend th' all-seeing eye:
Who on each other prey, who wrest the right, Aweless of heaven's revenge, are open to their sight.
For thrice ten thousand holy dæmons rove
The nurturing earth, the delegates of Jove :
Hovering they glide to earth's extremes!
bound,
A cloud aerial veils their forms around ;
Guardians of man, their glance alike surveys
The upright judgments and th' unrighteous ways.
A virgin pure is Justice :
from the king
Of heaven her birth ;
a venerable thing
And glorious to the deities on high, Whose mansion is yon everlasting sky.
Driven by despiteful wrong, she takes her seat
In lowly grief at Jove's eternal feet:
There of the soul unjust her plaints ascend, So rue the nations when their kings offend , When, uttering wiles and brooding thoughts of ill, They bend the laws and wrest them to their will.
Beware, 0 monarchs !
ye that gifts devour, Make straight your judgments now in timely hour ;
That crooked equity no more be seen, Eras'd, forgotten, as it ne'er had been !
He wounds himself that aims another's wound, His evil counsels on himself redound.
Jove at his awful pleasure looks from high With all-discerning and all-knowing eye, Nor hidden from its ken what injured right Within the city-walls eludes the light.
Or oh !
if evil wait the righteous deed, If thus the wicked gain the righteous meed, Then may not I nor yet my son remain
In this our generation just in vain !
But sure my hope, not this doth Heaven approve, Not this the work of thunder-darting Jove.
Grave deep, 0 Perses !
what my words declare;
To justice cleave, from violence forbear.
This law the wisdom of the god assigned To human race and to the bestial kind :
To birds of air, and fishes of the wave, And beasts of earth, devouring instinct gave;
In them no justice lives :
he bade be known
This better sense to reasoning man alone.
Who from the seat of judgment shall impart
The truths of knowledge uttered from his heart, On him the god of all-discerning eye Pours down the treasures of felicity.
Who sins against the right, his wilful tongue With perjuries of lying witness hung, Lo !
he is hurt beyond the hope of cure;
Dark is his race, nor shall his name endure.
Who fears his oath shall leave a name to shine With brightening lustre through his latest line.
Insensate Perses !
let the truths I tell,
That spring from knowledge, in thy bosom dwell Lo! wickednesses rife in troops appear;
Smooth is the track of vice, the mansion near:
But virtue dwells on high ;
the gods before
Have placed the dew that drops from every pore ;
And at the first to that sublime abode, Long, steep th' ascent, and rough the rugged road:
But when thy slow steps the rude summit gain, Easy the path and level is the plain.
Far best is he whom conscious wisdom guides, Who first and last the right and fit decides :
He too is good that to the wiser friend
His docile reason can submissive bend :
But worthless he that reason's voice defies, Nor wise himself, nor duteous to the wise.
But thou, 0 Perses !
what my words impart
Let memory bind for ever on thy heart:
0 son of Dios !—labour evermore, That hunger turn abhorrent from thy door;
That Ceres blest, with spiky garland crown'd, Greet thee with love, and bid thy barns abound.
Still on the sluggard hungry want attends,
The scorn of man, the hate of heaven impends;
While he averse from labour drags his days, Yet greedy on the gains of others preys;
E'en as the stingless drones devouring seize With glutted sloth the harvest of the bees.
Love every seemly toil, that so the store
Of foodful seasons heap thy garner's floor.
From labour men returns of wealth behold, Flocks in their fields, and in their coffers gold:
From labour shalt thou with the love be blest
Of men and gods ;
the slothful they detest.
Not toil but sloth shall ignominious be :
Toil, and the slothful man shall envy thee;
Shall view thy growing wealth with alter'd sense, For glory, virtue, walk with opulence.
Thou like a god, since labour still is found
The better part, shalt live belov'd, renown'd :
If, as I counsel, thou thy witless mind, Though weak and empty as the veering wind, From others' coveted possessions turn'd, To thrift, compel, and food by labour earn'd.
Shame, which our aid or injury we find, Shame to the needy clings of every kind;
Shame to low indigence declining tends, Bold zeal to wealth's proud pinnacle ascends.
But shun extorted riches :
—oh far best
The heaven-sent wealth without reproach possest:
Whoe'er shall mines of hoarded gold command
By fraudful tongue or by rapacious hand-
As oft betides, when lucre lights the flame, And shamelessness expels the better shame-
Him shall the god cast down in darkness hurl'd, His name, his offspring, wasted from the world;
From his fond grasp shall fleet the guilty ore, Awhile shall dazzle, and be seen no more.
Alike the man of crime is he contest
Who spurns the suppliant, and who wrongs the guest;
Who impious climbs a brother's marriage bed, By ardour wild of stol'n embraces led ;
Who dares by crafty wickedness abuse
His trust, and robs the orphans of their dues;
Who on the threshold of afflictive age His hoary parent stings with taunting rage ;
—
On him shall Jove in anger look from high, And deep requite the dark iniquity.
But wholly thou from these refrain thy mind, Weak as it is, and wavering as the wind.
With thy best means perform the ritual part, Outwardly pure, and spotless at the heart;
And on thy altar let unblemished thighs
In fragrant savour to th' immortals rise.
Or thou in other sort mayst well dispense Wine-offerings and the smoke of frankincense;
Ere on the nightly couch thy limbs be laid, Or when the stars from sacred sunrise fade.
So shall thy piety accepted move
Their heavenly natures to propitious love:
Ne'er shall thy heritage divided be, But others part their heritage to thee.
Let friends oft bidden to thy feast repair;
Let not a foe the social moment share :
Chief to thy open board the neighbour call;
When, unforeseen, domestic troubles fall, The neighbour runs ungirded ;
kinsmen wait, And, lingering for their raiment, hasten late.
As the good neighbour is our prop and stay, So is the bad a pitfall in our way :
Thus blest or curst, we this or that obtain, The first a blessing, and the last a bane.
How should thine ox by chance untimely die ?
The evil neighbour looks and passes by.
If aught thou borrowest, well the measure weigh ;
The same good measure to thy friend repay :
Or more, if more thou canst, unasked concede ;
So shall he prompt supply thy future need.
Dishonest gains avoid :
dishonest gain Equivalent to loss will prove thy bane.
Who loves thee, love ;
him woo that friendly woos :
Give to the giver ;
but to him refuse
That giveth not :
their gifts the generous earn,
But none bestows where never is return.
Munificence is blest;
by heaven accurst Extortion, of death-dealing plagues the worst.
Who bounteous gives, though large his bounty flow, Shall feel his heart with inward rapture glow :
Th' extortioner of bold unblushing sin, Though small the plunder, feels a thorn within.
If with a little thou a little blend Continual, mighty shall the heap ascend.
Who bids his gathered substance gradual grow, Shall see not livid hunger's face of woe.
No bosom-pang attends the home-laid store, But rife with loss the food without thy door:
'Tis good to take from hoards and pain to need What is far from thee :
-Give the precept heed..
When broached or at the lees, no care be thine
To save the cask ;
but spare the middle-wine.
To him, the friend that serves thee, glad dispense With bounteous hand the hire of recompense.
In every compact be a witness near, Though with thy brother;
for it shall appear
As done in mirth :
mistrust alike we find And fond credulity destroy mankind.
Let no fair woman rob'd in loose array, That speaks the wanton, tempt thy feet astray:
Who soft demands if thy abode be near, And blandly lisps, and murmurs in thine ear:
Thy slippery trust the charmer shall beguile, For, lo!
the thief is ambush'd in her smile.
One only son his father's house may tend,
And e'en with one domestic wealth ascend :
But when thou diest in hoary years declined, Then mayst thou leave a second son behind ;
For many sons from heaven shall wealth obtain,
The care is greater, greater is the gain.
Do thus :
If riches be thy soul's desire, By toils on toils to this thy hope aspire.
When Atlas-born the Pleϊad stars arise Before the sun above the dawning skies, 'Tis time to reap;
and when they sink below The morn-illumin'd west, 'tis time to sow.
Know too, they set immerg'd into the sun
While forty days entire their circle run ;
And with the lapse of the revolving year, When sharpened is the sickle, re-appear.
Law of the fields, and known to every swain
Who turns the labour'd soil beside the main;
Or who, remote from billowy ocean's gales, Tills the rich glebe of inland-winding vales.
Plough naked, swain !
and naked sow the soil,
And naked reap ;
if kindly to thy toil
Thou hope to gather all that Ceres yields,
And view thy crops in season crown thy fields :
Lest thou to strangers' gates penurious rove.
And every needy effort fruitless prove ;
E'en as to me thou cam'st :
but hope no more
The willing bounty, nor the borrowed store.
Insensate Perses !
be the labours thine
Which the good gods to earthly man assign ;
Lest with thy spouse, thy babes, thou vagrant ply, And anguish'd crave those alms which all deny.
Twice may thy plaints benignant favour gain,
And haply thrice may not be pour'd in vain ;
If still persisting plead thy wearying prayer Thy words are nought, thy eloquence is air.
Did exhortation move, thy thought should be From debt releasement, days from hunger free,A dwelling first;
a ploughing steer be thine ;
A purchased girl, unwedded, tend thy kine :
Within let all fit implements abound, Lest, with refused entreaty wandering round Still press thy wants, the season glide away, And thou with scanted labour mourn the day.
Thy task defer not till the morn arise, Or the third sun th' unfinished work surprise ;
The idler never shall his garners fill, Not he that still defers and lingers still:
Lo !
diligence can prosper every toil;
With loss the loiterer strives, and execrates the soil.
When the strong sun abates his keener flame
That bath'd in sultry dew the languid frame ;
When rushes in fresh rains autumnal Jove, And man's unburden'd limbs now lightlier move , For now the star of day with transient light Rolls o'er our heads, and rests in longer night:
When from the worm the forest boles are sound, Trees bud no more, but earthward cast around
Their withering foliage,-then remember well The timely labour, and thy timber fell.
A mortar hew, and its dimensions be Three feet exact, the pestle cubits three, And cleave of seven just feet thy waggon's axle-tree ;
}
Commodious length :
if eight thy axe divide, Th' exceeding foot a mallet yields beside.
Shape many blocks of curved form to round
Thy wheel, and let three spans its orbit bound ;
Whereon slow-rolling thy suspended wain Ten spans in breadth may traverse firm the plain.
If hill or field supply an ilex-bough, Of bending figure like the downward plough, Bear it away ;
this durable remains
While thy strong steers in ridges cleave the plains ;
If with firm nails thy artist join the whole, Affix the share-beam and adapt the pole.
Two ploughs provide on household works intent, This art-compacted, that of native bent:
A prudent forethought;
one may crashing fail, The other instant yok'd shall prompt avail:
Of elm or bay the draught-pole firm endures, The plough-tail holm, the share-beam oak secures.
Two males procure;
two strong unbroken steers :
Be nine the just proportion of their years :
Nor shall they headstrong-struggling spurn the soil, And snap the plough and mar th' unfinished toil.
In forty's prime thy ploughman;
one with bread Of four-squar'd loaf in double portions fed:
He steadily shall cut the furrow true, Nor towards his fellows glance a rambling view, Still on his task intent:
a stripling throws Heedless the seed, and in one furrow strows
The lavish handful twice ;
while wistful stray
His longing thoughts to comrades far away.
Mark yearly when among the clouds on high
Thou hear'st the shrill crane's migratory cry, Of ploughing-time the sign and wintry rains :
Care gnaws his heart who destitute remains
Of the fit yoke ;
for then the season falls
To feed thy horned steers within their stalls.
Though easy were the prayer, " Indulgent friend !
Assist my need ;
a wain and oxen lend :
"
Yet easy might the prompt excuse deny, " My wain and oxen must myself supply."
Rich in his own conceit, he then too late May think to rear the waggon's timbered weight Fool!
nor yet knows the complicated frame A hundred seasoned blocks may fitly claim:
These let thy timely care provide before, And pile beneath thy roof the ready store.
Improve the season:
to the plough apply, Both thou and thine ;
and toil in wet and dry :
Haste to the field with break of glimmering morn,
That so thy grounds may wave with thickening corn.
In spring upturn the glebe ;
and break again With summer tilth the iterated plain, It shall not mock thy hopes :
be last thy toil, When rais'd in ridges light, to sow the fallow'd soil:
The fallow'd soil bids execration fly, And brightens with content the infant's eye.
Jove subterrene, chaste Ceres claim thy vow, When, grasping first the handle of the plough, O'er thy broad oxen's backs thy quickening hand With gentle stroke lets fall the goading wand ;
Whilst yok'd and harness'd by the fastening thong, They slowly drag the draught-pole's length along
So shall the sacred gifts of earth appear, And ripe luxuriance clothe the plenteous ear.
A boy should tread thy steps;
with rake overlay
The buried seed, and scare the birds away:
(Good is the apt economy of things, While evil management its mischief brings.)
Thus, if ethereal Jove thy cares befriend, And crown thy tillage with a prosperous end, Shall the rich ear in fulness of its grain Nod on the stalk and bend it to the plain.
So shalt thou sweep the spider's films away
That round thy hollow bins lie hid from day;
I ween, rejoicing in the foodful stores
At length obtain'd, and laid within thy doors.
For plenteousness shall glad thee through the year, Till the white blossoms of the spring appear:
Nor thou on others' wealth a gazer be, But others owe their borrow'd wealth to thee.
If, ill-advis'd, thou turn the genial plains
His wintry tropic when the sun attains, Thou then mayst reap, and idle sit between;
Mocking thy gripe the meagre stalks are seen:
Whilst little joyful gather'st thou in bands
The corn whose chaffy dust bestrews thy hands:
In one scant basket shall thy harvest lie, And few shall pass thee then with honouring eye.
Now thus, now otherwise is Jove's design, To man inscrutable the ways divine:
But if thou late upturn the furrow'd field, One happy chance remedy may yield.
O'er the wide earth when men the cuckoo hear From spreading oak-leaves first delight their ear
Three days and nights let heaven in ceaseless rains Deep as thy ox's hoof o'erflow the plains ;
So shall an equal crop thy time repair With his who earlier launched the shining share.
Lay to thy heart the counsels thus reveal'd,
That not a sign be e'er from thee conceal'd:
What showery seasons ask be thine to know, And what the infant spring that blossoms into snow.
Pass by the brazier's forge where saunterers meet, Nor loiter in the throng'd piazza's heat:
When in the wintry season rigid cold Invades the limbs, and binds them in its hold;
Lo! then th' industrious man with thriving store Improves his household management the more;
And this do thou :
lest intricate distress
Of winter seize and needy cares oppress;
Lest, famine-smitten, thou at length be seen To gripe thy tumid foot with hand from hunger lean.
Pampering his empty hopes, yet needing food, On ill designs behold the idler brood:
Still in the saunterer's place he sits reclin'd, An evil hope is lurking in his mind, While scant his means of life:
thou wiser haste, Ere the mid-summer's favouring moment waste :
Thy household timely warn, " The summer day Endures not ever;
toil while yet ye may."
Beware the January month;
beware
Those hurtful days, that keenly piercing air Which flays the steers;
while frosts their horrors cast, Congeal the ground and sharpen every blast.
From Thracia's courser-teeming region sweeps
The northern wind, and breathing on the deeps
Heaves wide the troubled surge;
earth echoing roars
From the deep forests and the sea-beat shores.
He from the mountain-top with shattering stroke Rends the broad pine, and many a branching oak Hurls 'thwart the glen :
while sudden from on high, With headlong fury rushing down the sky, The whirlwind stoops to earth, then deepening round Swells the loud storm, and all the boundless woods resound.
The beasts their cowering tails with trembling fold, And shrink and shudder at the gusty cold.
Thick is the hairy coat, the shaggy skin,
But that all-chilling breath shall pierce within.
Not his rough bide can then the ox avail,
The long-hair'd goat defenceless feels the gale ;
Yet vain the north-wind's rushing strength to wound
The flock, with sheltering fleeces fenced around.
The aged man inclines his bowed form, But safe the tender virgin from the storm.
She strange to lovely Venus' mystic joys Beneath the mother's roof her hours employs.
Around her nightly flows the tepid wave, And shining oils in liquid fragrance lave
Her yielding limbs;
thus pillow'd to repose
In her soft chamber, while the tempest blows.
Now gnaws the boneless polypus his feet, Starved midst bleak rocks, his desolate retreat:
For now no more the sun's reflected ray Through waves transparent guides him to his prey.
O'er tawny Afric rolls his bright career, And slowly gilds the Grecian hemisphere.
And now the horned and unhorned kind, Whose lair is in the wood, sore-famish'd grind
Their sounding jaws, and frozen and quaking fly
Where oaks the mountain dells imbranch on high;
They seek to couch in thickets of the glen, Or lurk deep-shelter'd in the rocky den.
Like aged men who propped on crutches tread Tottering, with broken strength and stooping head, So move the beasts of earth ;
and creeping low Shun the white flakes, and dread the drifting snow.
I warn thee, now around thy body cast A thick defence and covering from the blast:
Let the soft cloak its woolly warmth bestow, The under-tunic to thy ankle flow:
On a scant warp a woof abundant weave;
Thus warmly woven the mantling cloak receive:
Nor shall thy limbs beneath its ample fold With bristling hairs start shivering to the cold.
Shoes of a slaughtered ox's lasting hide, Soft-lin'd with socks of wool, thy feet provide:
And kid-skins 'gainst the rigid.
season sew With sinew of the bull, and sheltering throw Athwart thy shoulders when the rains impend;
And let a well-wrought cap thy head defend, And screen thine ears, when drenching showers descend.
Bleak is the morn, when blows the north from high ;
Oft when the dawnlight paints the starry sky, A misty cloud suspended hovers o'er
The spacious earth with fertilizing store, Drained from the living streams:
aloft in air The whirling winds the buoyant vapour bear, Resolved at eve in rain or gusty cold
As by the north the troubled rack is roll'd.
Preventing this, the labour of the day Accomplished, homeward bend thy hastening way ;
Lest the dark cloud with whelming rush deprest Drench thy cold limbs, and soak thy dripping vest.
This winter-month with prudent caution fear;
Severe to flocks, nor less to men severe:
Feed thy keen husbandman with larger bread, With half their provender thy steers be fed ;
Them rest assists:
the night's protracted length Recruits their vigour and supplies their strength.
This rule observe, while still the various earth Gives every fruit and kindly seedling birth:
Still to the toil proportionate the cheer, The day to night, and equalize the year.
When from the wintry tropic of the sun Full sixty days their finished round have run, Lo!
then the sacred deep Arcturus leave First whole-apparent on the verge of eve:
Through the gray dawn the swallow lifts her wing, Morn-plaining bird, the harbinger of spring.
Anticipate the time ;
the care be thine An earlier day to prune the shooting vine.
When the house-bearing snail is slowly found To shun the Pleïad heats that scorch the ground, And climb the plant's tall stem, insist no more To dress the vine, but give the vineyard o'er.
Whet the keen sickle, hasten every swain, From shady bowers, from morning sleep refrain:
Now in the fervour of the harvest-day, When the strong sun dissolves the frame away, Now haste afield ;
now bind the sheafy corn, And earn thy food by rising with the morn.
Lo!
the third portion of thy labour's cares
The early morn anticipating shares:
In early morn the labour swiftly wastes;
In early morn the speeded journey hastes:
The time when many a traveller tracks the plain, And the yok'd oxen bend them to the wain.
When the green artichoke ascending flowers;
When in the sultry season's toilsome hours, Perch'd on a branch beneath his veiling wings, With shrill sweet note Cicada frequent sings;
Then the plump goat a savoury food bestows,
The poignant wine in mellowest flavour flows;
Wanton the blood then bounds in woman's veins, But weak of man the heat-enfeebled reins;
Full on his brain descends the solar flame, Unnerves the languid knees, and all the frame Exhaustive dries away ;
—O then be thine The grotto's arching gloom, the Byblian wine.
Let kneaded milk-cakes, and the milk that flows Defrauded from the kid, thy feast compose:
Let heifers young their tender flesh afford Fed on the forest-browse, and kidlings crown the board.
With dainty food so saturate thy soul, And drink the wine dark-mantling in the bowl:
While in the coolness of the shade reclin'd, Thy face is turn'd to catch the breathing wind, And feel the freshening brook that sparkling glides With living waters and transparent tides.
To fill the goblet from the wave be thine Three parts;
the fourth may flow with brimming wine.
When first Orion's beamy strength is born, Let then thy labourers thrash the sacred corn.
Smooth be the level floor, on breezy ground, Where winnowing gales may sweep in eddies round;
Hoard in thy ample bins the meted grain;
And now, as I advise, thy hireling swain From forth thy house dismiss, when all the store
Of kindly food is laid within thy door;
And to thy service let a female come, But childless, for a child were burdensome.
A sharp-tooth'd dog maintain, nor thrifty spare
To feed his fierceness high with pampering care;
Lest the day-slumbering thief thy nightly door Wakeful besiege, and spoil thy plunder'd store.
For ox and mule the yearly fodder lay, And pile th' abundant straw, the plenteous hay:
This care despatched, refresh the wearied swain With rest, and loose thy oxen from the wain.
When Sirius and Orion the mid-sky Ascend, and on Arcturus looks from high The rosy-finger'd morn, the vintage calls;
Then bear the gathered grapes within thy walls.
Ten days and nights expos'd the clusters lay, Basked in the radiance of each mellowing day:
Let five their circling round successive run, Whilst lie thy grapes o'ershaded from the sun;
The sixth express the harvest of the vine, And teach thy vats to foam with joy-inspiring wine.
But when beneath the skies on morning's brink The Pleiads, Hyads, and Orion sink;
Know then the ploughing and the seed-time near:
-
Thus well-dispos'd shall glide thy rustic year.
But if thy breast with nautical desire
The perilous deep's uncertain gains inspire;
When chas'd by strong Orion down the heaven Sink the seven stars in gloomy ocean driven;
Then varying winds in gustful eddies rave;
Let not a vessel tempt the blackening wave:
But, as I counsel, with contented toil The land essay and exercise the soil.
Hale from the wave thy bark on solid ground,
And stedfast prop with steadying stones around, Firm 'gainst the strength of winds that rushing bear
The showery tempest through the sounding air:
Draw from its keel the peg, lest rotting rain Suck'd -in the hollow of the hold remain.
Beneath thy roof secure the tackling lay, And furl thy vessel's wings that skimm'd the watery way.
The well-fram'd rudder in the smoke suspend, And calm and navigable seas attend, Then launch the rapid bark ;
fit cargo load ;
And freighted rich repass the liquid road.
0 witless Perses !
thus for honest gain,
Thus did our mutual father plough the main.
Erst from Æolian Cuma's distant shore, Hither in sable ship his course he bore:
Through the wide seas his venturous way he took, No rich revenues, prosperous ease forsook:
His wandering course from poverty began, The visitation sent from heaven to man.
In Ascra's wretched hamlet, at the feet Of Helicon, he fix'd his humble seat :
- Ungenial clime;
in wintry cold severe, And summer heat, and joyless through the year.
Each labour, Perses!
let the seasons guide;
But o'er thy navigation chief preside:
Decline a slender bark ;
intrust thy freight
To the strong vessel of a larger rate:
The larger cargo doubles every gain;
Let but the winds their adverse blasts restrain.
If thy rash thought on merchandise be plac'd, Lest debts insnare or woeful hunger waste, Learn now the courses of the roaring sea, Though ships and voyages are strange to me.
Ne'er o'er the sea's broad way my course I bore, Save once from Aulis to th' Eubœan shore:
From Aulis, where the mighty Argive host, The winds awaiting, lingered on the coast;
From sacred Greece assembled to destroy
The guilty walls of beauty-blooming Troy.
I pass'd to Calchis, where around the grave Of king Amphidamas, in battle brave, His valiant sons had solemn games decreed, And heralds loud announced full many a meed
There let me boast, that victor in the lay I bore a tripod ear'd, my prize, away:
This to the maids of Helicon I vow'd, Where first their tuneful inspiration flow'd.
Thus far in ships does my experience rise, Yet bold I speak the wisdom of the skies;
Th' inspiring Muses to my lips have given
The lore of song, and strains that breathe of heaven.
When from the summer tropic fifty days
Have roll'd, when summer's time of toil decays;
Then is the season fair to spread the sail;
Nor then thy ship shall founder in the gale, And seas overwhelm the crew;
unless the power
Who shakes the shores have will'd their mortal hour;
Or heaven's eternal king require their breath, Whose hands the issues hold of life and death, Of evil and of good.
But now the seas Are dangerless, and clear the calmy breeze.
Then trust the winds, and let thy vessel sweep
With all her freight the level of the deep.
But rapidly retrace thy homeward way, Nor wait the vintage-time with rash delay;
Nor autumn rains, that speak the winter nigh;
Nor the south blast, that fearful tosses high The troubled surge;
while ether pours amain Th' autumnal deluge down, and heaves the billowy plain.
There are who launch in spring:
when first the crow Imprinting with light steps the sands below;
As many thinly scattered leaves are seen
To clothe the fig-tree's top with tender green;
The vernal voyage practicable seems, And pervious are the boundless ocean-streams:
-
I praise it not;
for thou with anxious mind Must hasty snatch th' occasion of the wind:
The drear event may baffle all thy care:
-
Yet thus, e'en thus, will human folly dare.
Of wretched mortals, lo!
the soul is gain;
But death is dreadful midst the whelming main.
These counsels lay to heart:
and, warned by me, Trust not thy whole precarious wealth to sea, Tost in the hollow keel:
a portion send;
Thy larger substance let the shore defend.
Fearful the losses of the ocean fall, When on a fragile plank embarked thy all:
So bends beneath its weight th' overburdened wain, And the crushed axle spoils the scattered grain.
The golden mean of conduct should confine
Our every aim-be moderation thine.
When full matureness crowns thy manhood's pride, Lead to thy mansion the consenting bride:
Thrice ten thy sum of years, the nuptial prime;
Nor fall far short, nor far exceed the time.
Four years the ripening virgin should consume, And wed the fifth of her expanded bloom.
A virgin choose, that morals chaste imprest
By thy wise love may stamp her yielding breast:
Some known and neighbouring damsel be thy prize, And wary bend around thy cautious eyes;
Lest by a choice imprudent thou be found
The merry mock of all the dwellers round.
No better lot has providence assigned Than a fair woman with a virtuous mind:
Nor can a worse befall, than when thy fate Allots a worthless, feast-contriving mate;
She with no torch of mere material flame Shall burn to tinder thy care-wasted frame;
Shall send a fire thy vigorous bones within,
And age unripe in bloom of years begin.
Be still observant, lest thine actions move Th' avenging notice of the blest above.
Let none in friendship with a brother vie;
Or should mischance divide the tender tie, Be not the first to point the vengeful sting, Nor speak for falsehood's sake the treacherous thing.
If he the first by word or deed offend, Doubly thy just resentment may descend.
If with conciliating love possest
He come atoning, clasp him to thy breast.
Wretched the man whom faith deceived shall send
In sad incertitude from friend to friend.
Ne'er let thy features with thy thoughts imprest Convict the secrets of thy silent breast.
Each name of opposite opprobrium shun;
The host of many, and the host of none.
Ne'er to the wicked a companion be;
Nor let the good be e'er revil'd by thee.
Ne'er suffer that thy tongue's reproof deny
The prayer of soul-devouring poverty:
It is a thing by sacred wisdom given, The givers are tli' immortal gods of heaven.
Lo!
the best treasure is a frugal tongue ;
The lips of moderate speech with grace are hung:
The evil-speaker shall perpetual fear Return of evil ringing in his ear.
When many guests combine in common fare, Be not morose, nor grudge a liberal share:
When all contributing the feast unite, Great is the pleasure and the cost is light.
When the libation of the morn demands
The sable wine, forbear with unwash'd hands
To lift the cup:
with ear averted Jove Shall spurn thy prayer, and every god above.
When from the funeral feast thy steps return, Let not thy breast with amorous transport burn:
From the glad feast of gods the soft embrace Court unreprov'd, and stamp the infant race.
Whene'er thy feet the river-ford essay, Whose flowing current winds its limpid way, Thy hands amid the pleasant waters lave;
And lowly gazing on the beauteous wave Appease the river-god:
if thou perverse Pass with unsprinkled hands, a heavy curse Shall rest upon thee from th' observant skies, And after-woes retributive arise.
Ne'er when the feast of gods respect demands
Apply the shining iron to thy hands;
Nor at the splendid board in sordid guise Pare from the fresh the dry excrescencies.
Ne'er let thy hand above the chalice rest
The ewer of wine:
the unsuspecting guest May from thy fault his own disaster drink, For evil omens lurk around the brink.
Ne'er in the midst th' unfinished house forego, Lest there perched lonely croak the clamorous crow.
Ne'er in unconsecrated vessels feed Nor lave;
a mischief shall the slight succeed.
Set not an infant, o'er whose head have roll'd
Twelve days, or twelve revolving moons grown old, On seats immoveable:
this ill prevent, Or, lo! his manhood shall be impotent.
Ne'er in the female baths thy limbs immerse:
In its own time the guilt shall bring the curse.
Ne'er let the mystic rites of altars move Deriding scorn;
but dread indignant Jove.
Do thus :
-and still with diligence of mind
The evil rumour shun of humankind.
Easy the burden at the first to bear, And light when lifted as impassive air;
But scarce can human strength the load convey, Or shake th' intolerable weight away.
Swift Rumour hastes, nor ever wholly dies, Through peopled realms on tongues unnumber'd flies;
Not earth's far shores her kindling flight confine, A goddess, and immortal as divine.
A DECENT heed thy slaves enjoin to pay, And well observe each Jove-appointed day.
The thirtieth of the moon inspect with care Each monthly task, and every ration share
To every slave:
and choose the hour that drawl Th' assembled people to the pleaded cause.
(Lo!
these the days appointed from above, By the deep counsels of all-sapient Jove.)
Of each new moon the rolling year around, The first, the fourth, the seventh are prosperous found:
Phœbus, the seventh, from mild Latona born, The golden-sworded god, beheld the morn.
The eighth, nor less the ninth, with favouring skies Speeds of th' increasing month each rustic enterprise:
And on th* eleventh let thy flocks be shorn, And on the twelfth be reap'd thy laughing corn:
Both days are good ;
yet is the twelfth contest More fortunate, with fairer omen blest.
On this the air-suspended spider treads, In the full noon his fine and self-spun threads;
And the wise emmet, tracking dark the plain, Heaps provident the store of gathered grain.
On this let careful woman's nimble hand Throw first the shuttle, and the web expand.
On the thirteenth forbear to sow the grain, But then the plant shall not be set in vain.
The sixteenth profitless to plants is deem'd, Auspicious to the birth of men esteemed;
But to the virgin shall unprosperous prove, Then born to light, or join'd in wedded love.
So to the birth of girls with adverse ray
The sixth appears, an unpropitious day:
But then the swain his wattled fold may weave;
Emasculation then the ram receive, And wanton kid;
and fortunate the morn To every birth, whene'er a man is born.
This day keen railleries loves, deluding lies, And love-tales bland, and whispered secrecies.
The eighth the goat and bellowing steer by rule Emasculate;
the twelfth the patient mule:
The twenty-ninth indulge in noon-day love, Profound in wisdom shall thy offspring prove.
The tenth propitious lends its natal ray To men ;
to gentle maids, the fourteenth day.
Tame the mild sheep on this auspicious morn, And ox of flexile hoof and wreathed horn, And labour-patient mule;
and now command Thy sharp-toothed dog, with smoothly flattering han d.
The fourth and twenty-fourth no grief should prey Within thy breast, for holy either day.
Fourth of the moon lead home thy blooming bride, And be the fittest auguries descried.
Beware the fifth, with horror fraught and woe:
'Tis said the Furies walk their round below, Avenging the dread oath ;
whose awful birth From Discord rose, to scourge the perjured earth.
On the smooth thrashing-floor the seventeenth morn Observant throw the sheaves of sacred corn:
For chamber-furniture the timber hew, And blocks for ships with shaping axe subdue.
The fourth upon the stocks thy vessel lay, Soon with light keel to skim the watery way.
The nineteenth mark among the better days, When past the fervour of the noontide blaze.
Harmless the ninth:
'tis good to plant the earth, And fortunate each male and female birth.
The twenty-ninth to broach the cask is best;
The prudent secret is to few contest.
Then yoke thy steers ;
thy mules in harness bind, And coursers, hoof'd with fleetness of the wind :
Let.
the swift ship with numerous banks of oars
Be launched this day along the sandy shores.
Yet few this day entirely faithful deem ;
Draw on the fourth thy wine's well-flavour'd stream ;
Holy the fourteenth day beyond the rest;
The twenty-fourth o'er all at morning best;
Few know the secret truth :
and worst the day
When past the fervour of the noontide ray.
These are the days of which the careful heed Each human enterprise will favouring speed :
Others there are, which intermediate fall, Mark'd with no auspice, and unomen'd all:
And these will some and those will others praise
But few are versed in mysteries of days.
Now as a stepmother the day we find Severe, and now as is a mother kind.
Oh fortunate the man !
oh blest is he, Who, skill'd in these, fulfils his ministry :
—
He to whose note the auguries are given, No rite transgress'd, and void of blame to heaven.
Inter Callimachl sat erit placuisse libellos, St cecinisse modis, pure poeta, tuis.—PaCPERT.WHILST we to Jove, immortal and divine, Perform the rites, and pour the ruddy wine, Whom shall the Muse with sacred rapture sing But Jove th' almighty and eternal king, Who from high heaven with bursting thunder hurl'd
The sons of earth, and awes th' ethereal world ?
But say, thou first and greatest power above !
Shall I Dictæan or Lycæan Jove Attempt to sing ? ...
Who knows thy mighty line ?
And who can tell, except by power divine, If Ida's hills thy sacred birth may claim, Or far Arcadia boast an equal fame ?
The Cretans, prone to falsehood, vaunt in vain, And impious built thy tomb on Dieted plain ;
For Jove, th' immortal king, shall never die, But reign o'er men and gods above the sky.
In high Parrhasia Rhea bore the god, Where gloomy forests on the mountans nod;
And hence such awful horror guards the grove, Made holy by the glorious birth of Jove, That now no teeming female dares presume
To bear her young amid the hallowed gloom :
Nor beast nor insect shall approach the shade, Nor matron chaste invoke Lucina's aid Within the dark recess, still known to fame, And Rhea's ancient bed th' Arcadians name.
Soon as her womb discharged the mighty load, She sought a spring to bathe the new-born god, But in Parrhasia yet no stream appears, Though fam'd for numerous rills in after-years;
And when the Power ungirt her spacious breast, The dusty fields displayed a barren waste.
Nor yet broad Ladon flow'd, the plains to lave, Nor Erymanthus pour'd his limpid wave;
Wide-branching oaks Iäsus' channel shade, And chariots roll on Mela's sandy bed:
Unnumber'd savage beasts securely throng, Where now deep Carion swiftly glides along;
A thirsty swain amid the wilds might go, Where crystal Gratis and Metopè flow, Nor find a spring ;
but still, with wonder, hear Th' imprisoned water murmuring on his ear.
The venerable goddess, thus distress'd, With awful voice the pregnant earth addressed;
Slight are thy pangs, 0 friendly Power, she said, Bring forth like me to give thy suppliant aid.
She raised her mighty arm as thus she spoke, And with her sceptre struck the solid rock;
Wide at the blow the yawning mountain rent, The floods impetuous issued from the vent, And poured along the ground in swelling streams, Where soon she bath'd Jove's beauteous infant-limbs.
Thy body cleansed, and wrapt in purple bands, She gave the precious pledge to Neda's hands, And much enjoin'd her, with a mother's care, To seek the Cretan cave and hide thee there.
For she was first-born of the beauteous maids
That nurs'd the Thunderer in the gloomy shades, Save Styx and Philyre;
from whence she gained More high rewards than virgin e'er obtained:
For Neda's name the grateful goddess gave
To this most ancient stream, whose rolling wave With force impetuous pours along the plain, And near the walls of Leprium meets the main ;
The sons of Areas hear the waters roar, And drink the sacred flood, and crowd the shore.
Thee, mighty Jove, the nymph to Thenæ bore
And thence to Gnossus on the Cretan shore, But first at Thenæ cur'd thy recent wound :
Cydonians hence Omphalè nam'd the ground.
The nymphs of Dictè with encircling arms Embraced thee blooming in immortal charms ;
The fair Adraste next thy care began, And laid thy godhead in a golden van.
On Ida's hills the goat Amalthea bred, There gave thee suck ;
and mountain-honey fed, From bees that o'er the cliffs appear in swarms, Prepare their waxen domes with hoarse alarms, Collect the sweets of every fragrant flower, And on thy lips distil th' ambrosial shower.
The fierce Curetes circle o'er the ground
In warlike dance, and beat their shields around, That Saturn, for thy cries, might hear alone
The clang of armour on his distant throne.
Away thy infant years thus quickly flew, Thy power appearing as thy stature grew.
And soon thou glow'st with every youthful grace, And soon soft down o'erspreads thy beauteous face ;
Jove, yet a child, the prize of wisdom bears From both his brothers in maturer years:
And both agreed that th' empire of high heaven, Though theirs by birthright, should to Jove be given.
Yet ancient poets idle fictions tell
That lots were cast for heaven, for earth, and hell, Our ears thus flattering with amusive tales;
Wit pleases oftener than fair truth prevails.
None trust blind chance their fortune to decide, Unless for equal prizes lots are tried;
And who prefers the dark infernal bowers
To heaven's gay courts and bright ethereal towers ?
Chance plac'd not Jove in these divine abodes;
Thy power, thy wisdom, made thee king of gods!
Then first thy bird excell'd th' aerial kind, Thy mandates waited and revealed thy mind;
Now through the skies, at thy command he springs, And bears celestial augury on his wings.
All-gracious Power!
protect the friends I love, And send them favouring omens from.
above.Lo!
rob'd in purple, yonder shining bands
Of chosen youths whom Jove himself commands;
Not those who tempt the seas in search of gain, Or join fierce combat on the dusty plain, Invent the dance or raise the tuneful song;
These meaner cares t' inferior gods belong;
But those to whom imperial power is given, Jove's favoured sons, the delegates of heaven, Whom seamen, soldiers, merchants, bards obey, I And wide-extended empires own their sway.
The rough artificer owns Vulcan's power, And hardy soldiers warlike Mars adore;
The man who swift pursues the savage brood, Invokes Diana, huntress of the wood ;
And he, who strikes the lyre's resounding strings
With skilful hand, from bright Apollo springs, But kings from Jove;
except the royal line No rank on earth approaches to divine:
Their sacred power descends from mighty Jove, And he protects them from high heaven above.
Besides from him the power of judges springs,
And governors, the substitutes of kings;
He guards the city, o'er the state presides, Rewards the governor whom virtue guides;
But dire disgrace and ruin keeps in store For partial judges that abuse their power.
Though, mighty Jove !
thy scepter'd sons obtain Abundant wealth, and means of glory gain, Yet all receive not, by thy great decree, A n equal share of splendid pomp from thee;
For warlike Philadelphus reigns alone, And power supreme supports his sacred throne;
Glad evenir g still beholds the vast designs Complete, to which his morning thought inclines, Beholds complete in one revolving sun, What others, in long ages, but begun.
For Jove, in wrath, makes other kings to mourn
Their counsels blasted, and their hopes forlorn.
Hail!
mighty king;
hail!
great Saturniam Jove,
Who sends life, health, and safety from above;
Thy glorious acts transcending human tongue, Nor were, nor shall by mortal bard be sung!
0, from thy bright abodes let blessings flow;
Grant wealth, grant virtue to mankind below:
For we with wealth are not completely blest, And virtue fails when wealth is unpossess'd;
Then grant us both ;
for these united prove
The choicest blessing man receives from Jove.
WHAT force, what sudden impulse, thus can make
The laurel-branch, and all the temple shake!
Depart, ye souls profane;
hence, hence!
0 fly Far from this holy place !
Apollo's nigh;
He knocks with gentle foot;
the Delian palm Submissive bends, and breathes a sweeter balm ;
Soft swans, high hovering, catch th' auspicious sign, Wave their white wings, and pour their notes divine.
Ye bolts, fly back;
ye brazen doors, expand, Leap from your hinges, Phœbus is at hand.
Begin, young men, begin the sacred song, Wake all your lyres, and to the dances throng, Remembering still, the Power is seen by none Except the just and innocent alone;
Prepare your minds, and wash the spots away, That hinder men to view th* all-piercing ray, Lest ye provoke his favouring beams to bend On happier climes, and happier skies ascend:
And lo!
the Power, just opening on the sight, Diffuses bliss, and shines with heavenly light.
Nor should the youthful choir with silent feet, Or harps unstrung, approaching Phœbus meet, If soon they wish to mount the nuptial bed, To deck with sweet perfumes the hoary head, On old foundations lofty walls to build, Or raise new cities in some distant field.
Ye listening crowds, in awful silence hear Apollo's praises, and the song revere;
Even raging seas subside, when poets sing
The bow, the harp of the Lycorean king:
Nor Thetis, wretched mother, dares deplore Her lov'd, her lost Achilles, now no more!
But thrill'd with awe, she checks her grief and pain, When Io Paean sounds along the main.
The weeping rock, once Niobe, suspends Its tears a while, and mute attention lends;
No more she seems a monument of woe, Nor female sighs through Phrygian marble flow.
Sound lo!
lo !
such the dreadful end
Of impious mortals, that with gods contend;
Who dares high heaven's immortal powers engage, Against our king a rebel war would wage, And who rebels against our sovereign's sway Would brave the bright far-shooting god of day.
But rich rewards await the grateful choir
That still to Phoebus tune the living lyre;
From him all honour springs, and high above He sits in power, at the right hand of Jove.
Beyond the day, beyond the night prolong
The sacred theme, to charm the god of song.
Let all resound his praise ;
behold how bright Apollo shines in robes of golden light;
Gold are his quiver, harp, and Lyctian bow, And his fair feet with golden sandals glow.
All-bright in gold appears the Power divine, And boundless wealth adorns his Delphic shrine.
Immortal youth and heavenly beauty crown
His cheeks, unshaded by the softest down, But his fair tresses drop ambrosial dews, Distil soft oils, and healing balm diffuse:
And on what favour'd city these shall fall, Life, health, and safety guard the sacred wall.
To great Apollo various arts belong, The skill of archers and the powers of song;
By him the sure events of lots are given, By him the prophet speaks the will of heaven, And wise physicians, taught by him, delay The stroke of fate, and turn disease away.
But we to Nomius, heavenly shepherd, cry, Since he, for young Admetus, left the sky;
When burning with desire, he deign'd to feed A mortars coursers on Amphrysus' mead.
His herds increased, and overspread the ground, Kids leapt, and sportive lambkins frisked around, Where'er Apollo bent his favouring eyes, The flocks with milk abounded, grew in size, And pregnant ewes, that brought one lamb before, Now dropt a double offspring on the shore.
Ere towns are built, or new foundations laid, We still invoke the great Apollo's aid, And oracles explore;
for with delight He views new cities rising on the sight;
And Phœbus' self the deep foundations lays.
The god, but four years old, in former days, First rais'd a structure on th' Ortygian ground Close by the lake that ever circles round;
When young Diana, skill'd in hunting, laid Unnumber'd goats, on Cynthus' mountain, dead:
The careful goddess brought their heads away, And gave them to the glorious god of day;
He broke the horns, and rais'd with artful toil A wondrous altar from the sylvan spoil, Plac'd rows on rows, in order still disposed, Which he with circling walls of horn enclos'd;
And from this model, just in every part, Apollo taught mankind the builder's art.
Besides Apollo show'd my native place To Battus, and the fam'd Theraean race, A crow propitious sent, that flew before, And led the wanderers to the Libyan shore.
Apollo, marking from unclouded skies, Beheld Cyrenè's lofty towers arise, And faithful swore, that Egypt's king should gain
The new-built city and the fertile plain.
To tuneful Phoebus, sacred god of song, In various nations, various names belong;
Some Boedromius, Clarius some implore, But nam'd Carneiis on my native shore.
Thee, great Carneüs !
Sparta first possessed, Next Thera's isle was with thy presence bless'd;
You crossed the swelling main from Thera's bowers, And then resided in Cyrenè's towers.
The sixth from CEdipus conveyed the god From Lacedæmon o'er the watery road To Thera's isle;
but brought from Thera's strand By blameless Battus to Asbystis' land.
He rais'd a temple to record thy praise, Appointed annual feasts, on solemn days, In fair Cyrene;
sacred hymns resound, And slaughtered bulls lie bleeding on the ground.lo !
Carnean Phoebus !
all must pay
Their vows to thee, and on thine altars lay Green herbs and painted flowers, when genial spring Diffuses sweetness from Favonius' wing;
But when stern winter his dark power displays
With yellow crocus feed the rising blaze:
So flames unceasing deck thy hallow'd shrine, And breathe sweet odours to thy power divine.
With transport Phoebus views the warlike dance, When fierce Bellona's sons in arms advance, And, with brown Libyan virgins, tread the ground, When annual the Carneän feast comes round, Nor yet Alcides' sons had Cyrne seen, Her crystal fountain and extended green, But through Azilis' woods the wanderers strayed, And hid their heads within the dusky shade, When Phoebus standing on the horned hill Beheld the forest and the murmuring rill, And show'd the warriors to his lovely bride, Cyrenè fair attending at his side, Who kill'd the lion on Myrtusa's rocks, That tore the good Eurypylus's flocks.
Apollo saw not from the realms above A city more deserving of his love;
No rising town, no mighty state obtain'd Such gifts from Phoebus as Cyrenè gain'd, In dear remembrance of the ravish'd dame, That crown'd his love, and gave the city's name.
Nor were her sons ungrateful, but bestowed Superior honours on their guardian god.
Now lo !
Io Paean!
rings around
As first from Delphi rose the sacred sound, When Phœbus swift descending deign'd to show His heavenly skill to draw the golden bow.
For when no mortal weapons could repel Enormous Python horrible and fell, From his bright bow incessant arrows flew, And, as he rose, the hissing serpent slew.
Whilst Io !
Io Paean !
numbers cry, Haste launch thy darts, for surely from the sky Thou cam'st the great preserver of mankind, As thy fair mother at thy birth designed.
An equal foe, pale Envy, late drew near, And thus suggested in Apollo's ear ;
I hate the bard who pours not forth his song
In swelling numbers, loud, sublime, and strong ;
No lofty lay should in low murmurs glide, But wild as waves, and sounding as the tide.
Fierce with his foot indignant Phoebus spurn'd Th' invidious monster, and in wrath return'd.
Wide rolls Euphrates' wave, but soil'd with mud, And dust and slime pollute the swelling flood:
For Ceres still the fair Melissæ bring
The purest water from the smallest spring, That softly murmuring creeps along the plain, And falls with gentle cadence to the main.
Propitious Phœbus !
thus thy power extend,
And soon shall Envy to the shades descend.
THOUGH great Apollo claim the poet's lyre, Yet cold neglect may tempt Diana's ire.
Come, virgin-goddess, and inspire my song, To you the chace, the sylvan dance belong, And mountain-sports ;
since first with accents mild, Whilst on his knee the Thunderer held his child, 0 grant me, father, thus the goddess said, To reign a virgin, an unspotted maid.
To me let temples rise and altars smoke, And men by many names my aid invoke;
Proud Phœbus else might with thy daughter vie, And look on Dian with disdainful eye.
To bend the bow and aim the dart be mine, I ask no thunder nor thy bolts divine;
At your desire the Cyclops will bestow My pointed shafts and string my little bow.
Let silver light my virgin steps attend, When to the chace with flying feet I bend, Above the knee be my white garments roll'd
In plaited folds, and fring'd around with gold.
Let Ocean give me sixty little maids
To join the dance amid surrounding shades;
Let twenty more from fair Amnisius come, All nine years old, and yet in infant-bloom, To bear my buskins, and my dogs to feed, When fawns in safety frisk along the mead, Nor yet the spotted lynx is doom'd to bleed.
Be mine the mountains and each rural bower, And give one city for thy daughter's dower;
On mountain-tops shall my bright arrows shine, And with the mortal race I '11 only join, When matrons torn by agonizing throes Invoke Lucina to relieve their woes;
For at my birth the attendant Fates assign'd
This task to me, in mercy to mankind, Since fair Latona gave me to thy love, And felt no pangs when blest by favouring Jove.
She spoke, and stretch'd her hands with infant-art, To stroke his beard, and gain her father's heart;
But oft she rais'd her little arms in vain, At length with smiles he thus reliev'd her pain.
Fair daughter, lov'd beyond th' immortal race, If such as you spring from a stol'n embrace, Let furious Juno burn with jealous ire, Be mine the care to grant your full desire, And greater gifts beside :
from this blest hour Shall thirty towns invoke Diana's power, Full thirty towns, (for such high Jove's decree,) Ungirt by walls, shall pay their vows to thee :
O'er public ways Diana shall preside, And every port where ships in safety ride.
Nor shall these towns alone your power obey, But you with other gods divide the sway
Of distant isles amid the watery main, And cities on the continental plain, Where mighty nations shall adore your name, And groves and altars your protection claim.
The Thunderer spoke, and gave th' almighty nod, That seals his will, and binds th' immortal god.
Meantime the joyful goddess wings her flight To Creta's isle with snowy mountains bright;
Thence from Dictynna's hills and bending wood
She seeks the caverns of the rolling flood, And at her call th* attendant virgins come, All nine years old, and yet in infant bloom.
With joy Cæratus views the smiling choir, And hoary Tethys feels reviving fire, When her bright offspring o'er th' enamel'd green Trip with light footsteps and surround their queen.
But thence to Melegunis' isle in haste (Now Lipara) the sylvan goddess pass'd, Her nymphs attending, and with wondering eyes Saw the brown Cyclops of enormous size, Deep in their darksome dwelling under ground, On Vulcan's mighty anvil turning round A mass of metal hissing from the flame:
The sea-god urges, and for him they frame A wondrous vase, the liquor to contain
That fills his coursers on the stormy main.
With horror chill'd, the timorous virgins eye Stupendous giants rear their heads on high, Like cloud-capt Ossa rising o'er the field;
One eye, that blaz'd like some refulgent shield, From each stern forehead glar'd pernicious fire.
Aghast they gaze, when now the monsters dire
With stubborn strokes shake the resounding shore, And the huge bellows through the caverns roar.
But when from fiercer flames the metal glows,
And the fix'd anvil rings with heavier blows, When ponderous hammers break the tortured mass, Alternate thundering on the burning brass, The nymphs no more endure the dreadful sight, Their ears grow deaf, their dim eyes lose the light;
A deeper groan through labouring Ætna runs, Appals the hearts of old Sicania's sons, Redoubles from Hesperia's coast around, And distant Cyrnus thunders back the sound.
No wonder that Diana's tender maids
Should sink with terror in these gloomy shades;
For when the daughters of th' immortal gods
With infant-clamours fill the blest abodes, Arges or Steropes the mother calls (Two Cyclops grim) from their infernal halls
To seize the froward child;
no Cyclops come, But, loudly threatening, from some inner room Obsequious Hermes swift before her stands, With blackened face, and with extended hands;
The frighted infant, thus composed to rest, Forgets its cries, and sinks upon her breast.
But fair Diana, scarce three summers old, Could with her mother these dread realms behold, When Vulcan, won by her enchanting mien, With welcome gifts received the sylvan queen :
Stern Bronte's knee the little goddess prest, And pluck'd the bristles from his brawny breast, As if dire Alopecia's power had torn The hairs that shall no more his chest adorn.
Now undismayed, as then, the goddess cried, Ye mighty Cyclops, set your tasks aside, And for Jove's daughter forge immortal arms, To fright the savage race with wild alarms;
Sharp arrows to pursue the flying foe, A sounding quiver, and a dreadful bow, Such as Cydonians use;
for know that I Descend, like Phoebus, from the realms on high, And, when some tusky boar resigns his life, Beneath my darts amid the sylvan strife, Th' unwieldy victim shall reward your toil, And hungry Cyclops gorge the grateful spoil.
She spoke;
the tawny workmen swift obey'd, And in one instant arm'd th' immortal maid.
But now the goddess sought, nor sought in vain, Pan, the protector of th' Arcadian plain;
She found the god dividing 'mongst his hounds
The flesh of lynxes from Mænalea's grounds.
Six beauteous dogs, when first she came in view, Swift from the pack the bearded shepherd drew.
One silver spangles round his body bears, Two streaked with white, and three with spotted ears, All fierce in blood;
the weaker prey they slew, And living lions to their kennel drew.
Seven more he gave of Sparta's hardy race, Fleet as the winds, and active in the chace
Of fauns, that climb the mountain's lofty steep, And hares, that never shut their eyes in sleep;
Skill'd through the porcupine's dark haunts to go, And trace the footsteps of the bounding roe.
The nymph accepting leads her hounds with speed
To verdant hills above the Arcadian mead, And on the mountain's airy summit finds (Sight wondrous to behold) five beauteous hinds, That on Anaurus' flowery margin fed (Where mossy pebbles fill'd his ample bed)
In size like bulls, and on their heads divine High horns of beaming gold resplendent shine.
Soon as the vision open'd on her eyes, These, these, she said, shall be Diana's prize, Then, o'er the rocks, pursued the mountain-winds, Outstripp'd the dogs, and seiz'd the flying hinds;
One unobserv'd escap'd, but four remain To draw her chariot through th' ethereal plain.
The fifth, by Juno's wiles, took swift her way Through Celadon's dark flood ;
the glorious prey To Cerynaeus' distant mountains run;
A future prize for great Alcmena's son.
Hail, fair Parthenia, beauteous queen of night, Who hurl'd fierce Tityus from the realms of light;
I see the nymph in golden arms appear.
Mount the swift car, and join th* immortal deer:
A golden zone around her waist she binds,
And reins of gold confine the bounding hinds.
But whether first, 0 sacred virgin, say, Did your bright chariot whirl its airy way ?
To Hæmus' hills, whence BoreRs fiercely blows
On wretched mortals frost and winter snows.
But whence the pine, and whence the kindling flame ?
The pine from Mysia's lofty mountain came;
Jove's thunder roar'd;
red lightning streamed on high To light the torch that blazes through the sky.
Say next, how oft the silver how you drew, And where, bright queen, your vengeful arrows flew.
An elm received the first, an oak the next;
The third a mountain savage deep transfixed ;
More swift the fourth, like rattling thunder springs, And hurls destruction from its dreadful wings
On realms accurst, where justice ne'er was shown To sons of foreign states, or of their own, Deep sunk in crimes !
—How miserable they 'Gainst whom thy vengeance wings its distant way !
Disease devours the flocks, dire hail and rain Destroy the harvest, and lay waste the plain.
The hoary sire, for guilty deeds undone, Shaves his grey locks, and mourns his dying son.
In agonizing pangs, her babe unborn, The matron dies, or from her country torn To some inhospitable clime must fly, And see th' abortive birth untimely die.
Thrice happy nations, where with look benign
Your aspect bends ;
beneath your smiles divine
The fields are with increasing harvests crown'd,
The flocks grow fast, and plenty reigns around, Nor sire, nor infant-son, black death shall crave, Till ripe with age they drop into the grave;
Nor fell suspicion, nor relentless care, Nor peace-destroying discord enter there, But friends and brothers, wives and sisters, join The feast in concord and in love divine.0 !
grant your bard, and the distinguished few, His chosen friends, these happy dimes to view :
So shall Apollo's love, Diana's praise, And fair Latona's nuptials grace my lays;
And when my soul inspiring transport feels, Your arms, your labours, and the fervid wheels
Of your swift car, that flames along the sky To yonder courts of thundering Jove on high.
Your coming Acacesian Hermes waits, And great Apollo stands before the gates, To lift from off the car the sylvan prey, While Hermes joyful bears your arms away.
Nor Phœbus e'er his helping hand denies;
But when Alcides scal'd the lofty skies, This task to him was by the gods decreed, So from his ancient labours scarcely freed, Before th' eternal doors the hero stands, Expects the prey, and waits your dread commands.
In laughing crowds the joyous gods appear, But chief th' imperious step-dame's voice you hear Loud o'er the rest, to see Tirynthius pull Th' unwieldy weight of some enormous bull.
That with his binder foot impatient spurns
The labouring god, as from the car he turns.
The brawny hero, though with toil opprest, Approach'd the nymph, and quaintly thus add rest :
Strike sure the savage beast, and man to thee Will give the name before bestowed on me, The great Deliverer;
let the timid hare And bearded goat to native hills repair, And there securely range.
What ills proceed From hares or goats that on the mountains feed ?
Wild boars and trampling bulls oft render vain
The peasant's toil, and waste the ripening grain;
Aim there your darts, and let the monsters feel
The mortal wound, and the sharp-pointed steel.
He spoke, renew'd his toil, and heav'd away With secret gladness the reluctant prey.
Beneath the Phrygian oak his bones were burn'd,
And his immortal part to heaven returned, Yet still tormented with fierce hunger's rage, As when Theiodamas he durst engage.
Amnisian virgins from the car unbind
The sacred deer, and dress each panting hind;
Ambrosial herbage by their hands is given From meadows sacred to the queen of heaven, Where Jove's immortal coursers feed.
They bring Refreshing water from a heavenly spring
In golden cisterns of ethereal mould, The draught more grateful from a vase of gold.
But you, fair nymph, call'd by the powers above, Ascend the mansions of imperial Jove;
The gods rose graceful, when the virgin queen, With beauteous aspect and with look serene, By Phoebus' side assum'd her silver throne, Next him in power, and next in glory shone.
But when, with sportive limbs, the nymphs are seen
To dance in mazy circles round their queen, Near the cool fountains whence Inopus rose, Broad as the Nile, and like the Nile o'erflows;
Or when to Pitane or Limnæ's meads, Or Alæ's flowery field, the goddess leads
The choir, from Taurus black with human blood, And turns disgustful from the Scythian brood.
That day my heifers to the stall retire, Nor turn the green sward for another's hire;
.
Though nine years old, and in Tymphaea born, Their limbs though sturdy, and though strong of horn To drag the plough, and cleave the mellow soil,- Yet would their necks, o'erlabour'd, bend with toil, When Sol himself leans downward from the sky, Beholds the virgins with enraptur'd eye, Detains his chariot, whence new glories pour, Prolongs the day, and stops the flying hour.
What city, mountain, or what sacred isle, What harbour, boasts your most auspicious smile ?
And of th' attendant nymphs, that sportful rove Along the hills, who most enjoys your love, 0 goddess tell:
If you inspire their praise, Admiring nations will attend my lays.
Your favour Perga, green Doliche boasts, Taygettus' mountains, and Euripus' coasts;
And Britomartis, from Gertynas' grove, Of all the nymphs enjoys distinguished love:
Fair Britomartis (skill'd to wing the dart, And pierce with certain wound the distant hart) Imperial Minos chas'd with wild desire O'er Cretan hills, and made the nymph retire
To some far distant oak's extended shade, Or sheltering grove, or marsh's watery bed.
Nine months the king pursued, with furious haste, O'er rocks abrupt, and precipices vast, Nor once gave back, but when the blooming maid Was just within his power, and none gave aid, His grasp eluding, from the impending steep Headlong she plung'd amid the swelling deep.
But friendly fishers on the main displayed
Their nets wide-stretching to receive the maid, And thus preserved her from a watery death, Worn out with toil, and panting still for breath.
And in succeeding times Cydonians hence Dictynna call'd the nymph;
the mountain, whence She leapt into the sea, bear Dicte's name, Where annual rites record the virgin's fame.
On that blest day, fair nymph, is wove for thee A garland from the pine or mastich tree;
The myrtle-branch untouched, that durst assail
The flying maid, and rent her snowy veil, And hence the man must bear the virgin's frown, Who shall her altars with fresh myrtles crown.
The name Dictynna, too, the Cretans gave (From her who fearless plunged beneath the wave)
To you, fair Upis, from whose sacred brows Resplendent glory with mild lustre flows;
But in your breast the nymph Cyrenè shares
An equal place, and equal favour bears, To whom in days of old your hands convey d Two beauteous hounds, with which the warlike maid Acquired renown before th' Iolcian tomb.
All-bright with locks of gold see Procris come, Majestic matron, Cephalus's spouse, Whom, though no virgin, you, great goddess, choose Companion of the chace, but o'er the rest Mild Anticlea your regard possest:
Fair as the light, and dearer than your eyes, She claims protection by superior ties.
These first bore quivers, these you taught to wing
The sounding arrow from the trembling string, With their right shoulders and white bosoms bare, They lead the chace, and join the sylvan war.
Your praises, too, swift Atalanta charm, lasius' daughter, whose resistless arm O'erthrew the boar;
you showed the nymph with art T' incite the hounds, and aim th' unerring dart.
But Calydonian hunters now no more Dispute the prize, since the fair virgin bore
The glorious trophy to th' Arcadian plain, Where his white teeth record the monster slain.
Nor now shall Rhcecus, nor Hylæus young, With lust inflam'd, or with fell envy stung, Lay hands unhallow'd on the beauteous maid, Or once approach her in th' Elysian shade;
Since their torn entrails on Mænalia tell How by her arm th* incestuous monsters fell.
Hail!
bright Chitone, hail!
auspicious queen, With robes of gold, and with majestic mien !
In many temples, many climes adore Your name, fair guardian of Miletus' shore.
The name Imbrasia, Chesias too is given
To you high thron'd among the powers of heaven, Since happy Nelus and th' Athenian host By your protection reached the fertile coast.
Great Agamemnon's hand a rudder bore, To grace your temple on Boeotia's shore, And gain your love, while adverse winds detain
The impatient Grecians from the roaring main;
Wild with delay on rugged rocks they mourn Rhamnusian Helen, from her country torn,When sudden frenzy seized the madd'ning brains Of Prætus' daughters on th' Achaian plains;
While o'er th' inhospitable hills they roam, You sought the maids, and safe conducted home:
Of this two sacred fanes preserve the fame, One to Coresia from the virgin's name;
To Hemeresia one in Loussa's shades, Mild Hemeresia cur'd the furious maids.
Fierce Amazonian dames to battle bred, Along th' Ephesian plains by Hippo led, With pious hands a golden statue bore
Of you, bright Upis, to the sacred shore, Placed where a beech-tree's ample shade invites
The warlike band to join the holy rites.
Around the tree they clash their maiden shields,
With sounding strokes that echo through the fields ;
Swift o'er the shores in wider circles spring, Join hand in hand to form a mazy ring, And beat, with measured steps, the trembling ground Responsive to the shrill pipe's piercing sound ;
The bones of deer yet uninspired and mute, From which Minerva formed a softer flute.
Discordant notes to lofty Sardis fly, And Berecynthus' distant hills reply ;
Hoarse-rattling quivers o'er their shoulders rung, While from the ground with bounding feet they sprung.
And after-ages saw, with glad surprise, A wondrous fabric round the statue rise, More rich, more beautiful, than Phœbus boasts, With all his glory, on the Delphic coasts:
Nor yet Aurora's morning beams have shone On such a temple, or so fair a throne.
But soon fierce Lygdamis descending down, With impious threats to burn th' Ephesian town, In numbers like the sand an host prepares Of strong Cimmerians, fed with milk of mares :
The bands unblest their sudden march began From frozen plains, where lowing Io ran.
Ah !
wretched monarch, fated now no more
To lead your legions to the northern shore;
Who drove their chariots o'er Cay ester's mead Shall ne'er in Scythian climes their coursers feed :
For bright Diana guards the sacred towers, And on th' approaching foe destruction pours.
Hail !
great Munychia;
for th' Athenian bay And Pheræ's fertile shores confess your sway;
Hail!
bright Pheræa ;
and let none presume
T' offend Diana, lest th' avenging doom Fall heavy on their heads, which Oeneus mourn'd, When, unsuccessful, from the field he turned For vows unpaid.
Like her let none pretend
To dart the javelin or the bow to bend ;
For when Atrides durst her grove profane, No vulgar death removed the fatal stain.
Let none, with eyes of love, the nymph behold, Lest, like fond Otus and Orion bold, They sink beneath her darts;
let none decline
The solemn dance, or slight the power divine:
E'en favoured Hippo feels her vengeful ire.
If from th' unfinished rites she dares retire.
Hail!
virgin queen, accept my humble praise;
And smile propitious on your poet's lays.
On when, my soul, wilt thou resound the praise Of Delos, nurse to Phoebus' infant-days, Or of the Cyclades ?
Most sacred these Of isles that rise amid surrounding seas;
And fame and hymns divine to them belong:
But Delos chief demands the Muse's song.
For there the god who leads the vocal train Was swath'd around ;
and on the Delian plain His infant-limbs were wash'd :
the sacred lay Triumphant rose to hail the god of day.
As who forgets, Pimplea the divine, Is soon forsaken by the tuneful Nine;
Thus on the bard, neglecting Cynthus' shores, Avenging Phoebus all his fury pours :
To Delos then let votive lays belong, is And Cynthian Phœbus will approve my song.
Though beat by billows, and though vex'd with storms,
The sacred isle its deep foundations forms Unshook by winds, uninjured by the deep.
High o'er the waves appears the Cynthian steep ;
And from the flood the sea-mew bends his course
O'er cliffs impervious to the swiftest horse:
Around the rocks th' Icarian surges roar, Collect new foam, and whiten all the shore Beneath the lonely caves, and breezy plain, Where fishers dwelt of old above the main.
No wonder Delos, first in rank, is placed Amid the sister isles on ocean's breast;
For when the sea-gods o'er the liquid plains
Seek these dark cells, where hoary Tethys reigns, Majestic Delos leads beneath the deeps
The watery train;
close following Cyrnus keeps
Her steady course;
Eubœa floats along, And fair Sardinia glides amid the throng.
Last, o'er the main, see flowery Cyprus move, That from the waves received the queen of love;
And in return the nymph, with favouring smile, Blest the bright shores, and guards the sacred isle.
Though towers in these and lofty bulwarks stand, Apollo still defends the Delian land, A stronger fortress, and a surer trust:
Strymonian Boreas levels with the dust
The work of human hands;
but Delos' god Stands unremov'd, and guards his lov'd abode.
Hail!
favour'd isle, where walls nor towers arise, A stronger power defends you from the skies.0 sacred Cynthus, much in song renown'd,
What theme delights ?
what shall the Muse resound
To thee most pleasing ?
Wilt thou bend thine ear
The mighty sea-god's glorious acts to hear ?
With those dread weapons, which the Telchins form, He shook the mountains, like a bursting storm, In times of old ;
from their foundations hurl'd Rocks, hills, and vales amid the watery world :
In rush the seas, and from the land divide
The numerous isles now rising from the tide, And fix'd for ever in the boundless main.
But Delos' isle along the liquid plain Still floated uncontrolled ;
her sacred name Asteria then ;
to her immortal fame, She shot from heaven like a descending star, Amid the roaring deeps and watery war, To shun th' embrace of Jove.
Asteria fair
She still was call'd;
till, bright with golden hair, Distressed Latona sought the shady shore, Hence Delos nam'd, Asteria now no more.
Oft sailors, wandering o'er the briny main From Lycian Xanthus or Trœzene's plain, Stood for the Ephyrian coast, and there descried Asteria floating on Saronia's tide:
But when returning to their native shore, Wide o'er the main the rolling isle no more Appeared in view ;
but held its rapid course, Driven by th' impetuous flood's resistless force, Where black Euripus' gulfs tempestuous roar, And dash the whitening waves on Chalcis' shore, Then, mounting o'er the surging billows, bounds From Sunium's rocks to Chios' flowery grounds, Or softly seeks Parthenia's fruitful soil, Not Samos yet;
and from the virgin isle The Mycalesian nymphs rejoicing pour, And hail thee to the hospitable shore Of kind Ancæus.
But thy sacred earth Supplied a place for great Apollo's birth, Hence thy new name the grateful sailors gave, And Delos call'd along the trackless wave ;
An undistinguished course no more you keep, But fix'd and rooted in the Ægean deep.
Nor didst thou dread imperial Juno's ire, That burst impetuous, like the force of fire, On every goddess, from whose secret love A rising offspring crown'd th' embrace of Jove But chief pursued Latona ;
well she knew That from Latona's bed would rise to view
The brightest power in heaven, and dearer far To thundering Jove than the stern god of war, Amid the skies th' observing goddess sat, And brooded dire revenge, and furious hate Unutterable ;
watch'd the painful hour Of labour, and detained the struggling power:
Then sent two faithful messengers on earth To guard the shores and wait th' approaching birth.
Bright in immortal arms stern Mars appears On Hæmus' hills ;
o'er their proud summits rears
His towering head, and from the mountain's height Wide o'er the continent directs his sight:
Th' immortal steeds meanwhile stood far behind
In seven recesses of the northern wind.
Next Iris fierce descends on Mima's brows,
And o'er the scattered isles observing throws
Her careful eyes ;
with inauspicious threats Denounces vengeance on the pitying states, Where bright Latona turns distress'd with grief;
She bars access, and still denies relief.
Before the dreadful voice Arcadia fled, And high Parthenius bow'd his rocky head (Fair Auge's sacred hill) ;
Phenaeus bends
His aged steps, and close behind attends ;
And all the climes of Pelops' isle that lie Along the northern isthmus swiftly fly, Save Argos and Ægiale :
but there All entrance is denied by Juno's care, To whom the realms of Inachus belong.
Aonia frighted holds her course along
The self-same path ;
and Dirce swift succeeds, And Strophie, watering green Bceotia's meads, Upon whose hands their sire Ismenus hung, As black with mossy stones he roll'd along.
And sore disabled by the lightning's blast, Slow moves Asopus, with inactive haste ;
But native Dryads, pale with sacred awe, Swift from the dance their trembling feet withdraw, A nd shriek and sigh, when oaks coeval bend
Their green heads, and from Helicon descend.
Ye favouring Powers, immortal Muses, say, Do nymphs with oaks exist, with oaks decay ?
The nymphs rejoice, when oaks, refreshed with dew, Put forth their leaves, and spread their arms anew ;
The nymphs lament, when winter, black with storms, Sweeps off the leaves, and the green boughs deforms.
Apollo heard, and from his mother's womb Furious denounced th' unalterable doom On Thebæ's guilty realms, unhappy state !
Why thus provoke thy swift-approaching fate ?
Why tempt the god unwilling, to declare
The woes ungrateful Thebes is doomed to bear ?
For though no priestess on the tripod feels Inspiring power, nor thence our will reveals;
Nor yet, by darts divine, has Python bled, Slow moving on from Plistus' oozy bed, Hideous and huge he rears his shaggy chest, Black with infernal hairs, (tremendous pest!) Ascends Parnassus' hill, and dreadful throws
Nine sable volumes round his hoary brows.
Yet hear thy doom;
more awful the decree
Than e'er the laurel shall pronounce by me:
Fly hence;
but fate pursues :
my burning darts
Shall soon be quench'd in blood of Theban hearts.
Since thou retain'st the guilty race that sprung
From that vile woman with blasphemous tongue ;
Apollo's hallow'd birth shall never crown Cithæron's hill, nor Thebae's impious town.
The god is good, and only will bestow Distinguish'd blessings on good men below.
So spake the power unseen :
Latona mourn'd, And to th' Achaian states again returned.
But these against her tender suit combine, Nor grant admission to the Power divine;
Not ev'n high Helice, whose blooming charms Won mighty Neptune to her tender arms;
Nor humble Bura, rising near the flood, Where great Dexamenus his oxen stood lorty stalls.
Latona turns with sighs
To bleak Thessalia's realms and colder skies.
But there Larissa flies th* approaching god, Anaurus' waves, and all the rocks that nod On Pelion's brows;
nor Peneus dares abide, But rolls through Tempe's vale a swifter tide.
And thou, fierce Juno, still with rage possest, Remain'st unmov'd ;
no pity touched thy breast, When thus the goddess mourn'd with plaintive sighs, With outstretch'd arms, and with heart-rending cries.
Ye daughters of Thessalian floods, entreat Your aged sire, low bending at his feet, To stop the mighty wave;
0 grasp with care
His hoary beard, and urge him to prepare
His water to receive th* immortal son Of thundering Jove.
Ah!
why should Peneus run More swift than wintry winds ?
Thy flight is vain ;
Nor canst thou here a glorious prize obtain, As in th' equestrian strife.
0 father, say,
Have thy swift streams thus ever roll'd away ?
Or does Latona's pangs increase thy speed
To fly from her distress ?
In time of need, Alas!
he hears me not.
Where shall I turn ?
And where, unhappy!
shall thy son be born ?
My strength decays;
to Pelion I '11 repair, The bridal bed of Philyre the fair.
Stay, Pelion, stay.
A goddess asks no more
Than to the lioness you gave before;
Oft on thy cliffs she bears her savage young With dreadful yells, and with fierce anguish stung.
Sad Peneus wept, and answered thus with sighs:
A mightier god, Necessity, denies Thy prayer, 0 Power distressed, else soon should I Relieve thy woes, with thy request comply, And grant the boon to other births I gave, That oft were wash'd in my refreshing wave.
The queen of heaven on Peneus bends her eyes, And utters furious threats amid the skies;
Lo! from yon hill a champion fierce and dread Frowns stem destruction on my wretched head;
And could with ease my sable deeps o'verturn, Subvert my streams, and dry my fruitful urn.
All strife is vain ;
say, will it please thy soul, That Peneus perish, and no longer roll
His swelling streams ?
Th' avenging hour may come ;
But in thy cause I'll brave the dreadful doom;
Though my shrunk waves for ever cease to flow, And I be nam'd the meanest flood below;
Behold, approach, Ilythia's aid invoke.
He stopt his rapid current as he spoke.
But Mars perceived;
from their foundations tore Pangamus' hills, and in his arms upbore
The rocky mountain, an enormous load !
To choke the fountains, and overwhelm the flood.
His voice like thunder sounds;
the spear and shield Together struck, more dreadful murmurs yield:
When trembling Ossa heard, strange horrors fill Cranonia's field, high Pindus' distant hill, And shook Thessalia to her farthest bound.
As Ætna's inmost caverns under-ground Roar horrible with floods of rolling fire, And to the centre shake;
when, fierce with ire, Briareus turns beneath the mountain's height, And from his shoulders heaves th' incumbent weight;
Forge, tripods, tongs, the caldron's mighty round, And all the works of Vulcan, strike the ground With mingled clash:
such and more hoarse alarms Sprung from th' immortal powers' discordant arms.
But Peneus, unappall'd, retires no more, Collects his rolling waters as before, And stands unmov'd;
till thus Latona spoke:
Retire in peace, nor yon fierce gods provoke:
Thou shalt not suffer, though my lot be hard;
Nor thy compassion want its due reward.
Then o'er the main to distant isles she goes.
Struck with new pangs, inextricable woes, But still without success ;
nor aid is found Among the Echinades, for ports renown'd;
Nor dares Corcyra's hospitable coast Receive the power, along the billows tost.
For Iris dreadful stands in open sight, And pours her threats from Mima's lofty height:
Before her wrath the crowding islands fled, And sought the nearest river's friendly bed.
Latona turns to Merops' ancient seat, The Coan isle, Chalciope's retreat;
But Phoebus stops her course, and thus relates, With awful voice, th' irrevocable fates.0 goddess, I nor envy nor disdain
These flowery shores, and yonder fertile plain, But here thou bear'st me not;
Apollo sees A future god appear by Fate's decrees, The mightiest prince of Soter's royal race, To rule this favoured isle, his native place.
To him the willing world shall tribute bring;
Green isles and inland states obey the king, » And bow before him in succeeding times ;
His power extending from yon eastern climes, To distant shores, where Sol descending leads Beneath the western waves his wearied steeds.
From Macedonia comes the man divine, And in the son the father's virtues shine.
The glorious prince shall be my future care, And I the great companion of his war, When o'er the Celtic shores, with wild alarms, Gigantic nations clash barbarian arms.
The last of Titan's sons, a furious throng !
From th' utmost
West shall swiftly pour along, And, rushing dreadful, Grecian plains overflow, Thick as the driving rain or falling snow ;
Or numerous as yon silver lamps of night, That fill their urns with Jove's ethereal light.
From Locrian forts and undefended towns, From Delphic mountains, and Crissæan downs, From all the midland cities far around, Deep groans shall issue;
when along the ground Wide-wasting flames devour the ripening grain, And all the labours of th' adjoining swain.
Nor these shall hear alone the fierce alarms
Of hostile armies, sheath'd in shining arms Around my temple;
but with terror view Th' impetuous Gauls their impious course pursue, With bloody falchions, belts, and bucklers stain My holy tripods, and my cave profane, For which fierce war shall rage, at my command, And wreak my vengeance on th' unhallow'd band.
Of conquer'd armour, half shall deck my shrine, And half, the prize of valour, shall be thine, Illustrious prince !
when midst attacks and fire, On Nilus' banks the vanquished hosts expire.
Thus fate foretells the glory thou shalt gain, 0 Philadelphus !
in thy wondrous reign, For which, immortal King, thou still shalt pay Unceasing honours to the god of day ;
And future ages to the stars shall raise Apollo's name, and Philadelphus' praise, Both yet unborn ;
thy power, 0 mother, join, Fulfil the Fates, and aid my great design.
An isle there is yet unconfin'd and free, With feet unfix'd amid the rolling sea, To mariners well known ;
it wanders wide, Now here, now there, before the driving tide, And yields, and shakes, like pliant Asphodel, As east or western winds the floods impel:
There shall thy labours end.
The sacred earth Will grant relief, and aid my glorious birth.
As Phœbus spoke, th' obedient isles gave way Forsook the shores, and floated o'er the sea, Returning to their seats.
Not long before Th' Asterian isle had left Eubœa's shore, And, at the voice divine, came slowly down, To view the Cyclades of great renown, Encumber'd oft by dank sea-weeds, that sprung From rough Geræstus, and around her hung.
Full in the midst she stood;
beheld with grief Latona's dreadful pangs, and no relief.
At her command a fiery torrent roar'd Around the shores, the crackling weeds devoured, Prepar'd the sacred isle, and clear'd the skies;
While thus imperial Juno she defies.
Discharge thy vengeance on Asteria's head;
Thy frowns I reek not, nor thy threatenings dread ;
Come, goddess, come ;
my favouring shores ascend:
She heard, obey'd, and there her wanderings end.
By deep Inopus (whose dark fountains boil Still most impetuous, when th' o'erflowing Nile From Æthiopia's rocks descends amain, And spreads a sudden deluge o'er the plain)
Soft she reclined, the crowded zone unbound, And dropt her fainting limbs along the ground.
Against a shading palm her shoulders rest;
But racking pangs distend her labouring breast ;
Her body bath'd in sweat, with deepening groans, And painful sobbings, thus she pour'd her moans.
Why, why, my son, dost thou with anguish fill
My tortur'd heart with pangs increasing still ?
For thee, for thee I sought the watery plain ;
For thee this isle received me from the main:
Hast thou no pity for heart-rending throes ?
0 spring to light, and ease thy mother's woes !
"But Iris mounts, all trembling to reveal The fatal news she could no more conceal;
To wrathful Juno told the tale with tears, With broken accents and uneasy fears.
Majestic Juno, spouse of thundering Jove, Great Queen of heaven, and mightiest power above ;
Thy faithful Iris, all the gods are thine, Nor dread the wrath of other hands divine ;
But one presumptuous isle resists thy power, And aids Latona in the dangerous hour.
From her approach the rest abhorrent turned, Nor durst receive her when thy fury burn'd.
But vile Asteria, whom the surges sweep Around the shores, invited from the deep
Thy hated foe.
Her crimes I thus make known ;
But still, blest goddess, be thy favour shown T' obedient powers, that from these fields of air Walk o'er the world, and thy dread mandates bear.
She said, and hasty sunk beneath the throne, That bright with radiant gold resplendent shone:
As at Diana's feet a favourite hound
In silence listens to the distant sound Of passing game ;
and though soft slumbers creep
O'er his keen senses, only seems to sleep, Impatient waits the whispers of her voice, Erects his ears, and starts at every noise, So sat Thaumantia, fill'd with deep regret, Nor left her place beneath the sacred seat;
And ev'n when sleep, on downy pinions, came To shed soft dews o'er all her wearied frame, On Juno's throne her beauteous head reclin'd, And scarcely slumbering wak'd with every wind ;
Nor loosed the winged sandals, nor unbrac'd
The circling zone that bound her tender waist;
Lest some unthought of message, given in haste, Might claim her speed.
But other cares engage Th' imperial Queen, and thus she vents her rage.
Ye secret paramours, that bring disgrace
On faithless Jove !
bear your detested race
For ever thus, on barren rocks reclin'd, More wretched than the worst of humankind;
Or like th' unwieldy whale in watery caves ;
Or spawn your brood amid the whelming waves.
But this contents ;
nor let Asteria dread
My sudden wrath on her offending head;
For these unfertile shores can only show Poor entertainment to my hated foe, Her pangs to soften, and her grief t' assuage.
Asteria's virtue has disarmed my rage;
She sought the seas to shun th' embrace of Jove, Refused my bed, and hence enjoys my love.
Scarce had she spoke when Phœbus' tuneful swans, From rich Pactolus, and Mæonia's plains, Seven times, on snowy pinions, circle round The Delian shores, and skim along the ground:
The vocal birds, the favourites of the Nine, In strains melodious hail the birth divine.
Oft as they carol on resounding wings, To soothe Latona's pangs, as many strings Apollo fitted to the warbling lyre, In after-times;
but ere the sacred choir Of circling swans another concert sung
In melting notes, the power immortal sprung To glorious birth.
The Delian nymphs around Rise from the flood, in strains divine resound Ilythia's praise ;
triumphant songs aspire, And the rejoicing æther seems on fire.
Jove soothed his angry queen;
she dropt her scorn,
And felt the general joy when Sol was born.
Then, happy Delos!
thy foundations changed
To golden columns, in bright order ranged;
On that blest day thy circling lake became
Of liquid gold, and seemed a moving flame:
On golden branches golden olives roll'd, And deep Inopus flow'd in waves of gold.
Then lifting from the shining soil you prest, With arms encircling, to your snowy breast
The new-born god, and thus with pleasure spoke:
On thee, proud earth, unnumbered altars smoke ;
On thee fair cities, mighty states are seen;
Thy shores are fertile, and thy fields are green:
Thy thronging islands countless numbers yield, Whilst I lie waste with all my plains untill'd.
But since Apollo deigns to take my name, The power will bless, and grant me greater fame
Than all the world receives from gods beside :
More than from Neptune the Cenchræan tide;
More than Cyllene's hill, or Cretans plains, From Hermes one, and one from Jove obtains.
By Phoebus lov'd, my station here I '11 keep, And float no more amid the stormy deep.
So saying, she displayed her sacred breast, Which, with his lips, the smiling infant prest, And suck'd ambrosial juice;
from whence the name
Of isle most holy consecrates thy fame, 0 glorious nurse !
and hence thou ne'er shalt feel
The force of stern Belona's vengeful steel;
Nor here shall Pluto spread his dark domain, Nor Mars impetuous thunder o'er thy plain.
But tithes and first-fruits each revolving year, From distant climes shall on thy shores appear, And every state beneath the morning ray, The star of evening, or meridian day, Shall join the mystic dance;
ev'n those renown'd
For length of days shall tread the haHow'd ground From Hyperborean shores ;
by whom are borne
The first ripe ears and sheaves of yellow corn.
And the Pelasgi, from Dodona's shores, Shall first receive the consecrated stores;
The race, that nightly rest along the ground, Attentive to the caldron's mystic sound ;
Consigned by them the grateful off'rings fill The Melian city and the sacred hill:
From whence they pass to fair Lilantia's land, And from Eubcea reach thy neighbouring strand.
But Upis bright, and Hecaërge kind, And Loxo, daughters of the northern wind, With pious hands the first ripe off'rings bore )
To Delos' isle, from th' Arimaspian shore Fair youths attending, that return'd no more, But here were bless d;
and hence each hallow d name Shall ever flourish in immortal fame.
For when the Delian nymphs, a beauteous throng !
With amorous throbbings hear the nuptial song;
The joyful bridegroom hails the blissful morn, Whilst from his face the virgin down is shorn ;
The blushing bride, with equal speed, prepares, And from her head divides the votive hairs;
The first is sacred to the youths divine, The beauteous locks adorn the virgin's shrine.
From thee, fair Delos, sweet perfumes ascend;
Still, at thy feet, encircling islands bend ;
To solemn songs their verdant heads advance, And seem to move, as in the mazy dance;
When evening Hesper darts his rays around
Thy flowery shores, and brightens at the sound;
By chosen youths the lofty lays are sung
That flowed from Lycian Olen's tuneful tongue,.
An ancient seer ;
fair virgins dance around, And shake, with choral feet, the solid ground.
Bright Venus, listening to the hymns divine, The nymphs with garlands deck her ancient shrine, By Theseus rais'd;
when with the sons of Greece From Cretan plains he gained the shores in peace;
Returned in triumph o'er the briny main,.
From fell Pasiphaës monstrous offspring slain ;
For Venus guided through the maze beneath, The winding labyrinth, and the den of death.
Hence, beauteous queen, he led the choir around
Thy sacred altars, to the solemn sound
Of melting lyres ;
and here the Athenians sent, In grateful memory of this fam'd event, The shrouds and tackling to the god of day, That still remain, nor shall with time decay.
And since, Asteria, thy bright shores are crown'd With smoking altars, and with hymns resound, What mariners, when swift-wing'd vessels keep
Their course by thee, along th' Ægean deep, But here shall stop, and furl their swelling sails, Though bent on speed, and borne by driving gales ?
Nor shall return, till, circling o'er the ground, They shape the maze, and the struck altar sound With mystic blows, nor till, at thy command, With arms averted, as the rites demand, They bite the sacred olive.
Thus the god, 0 nymph of Delos, in thy bright abode, Was entertained ;
and thus Apollo spent His infant years in mirth and sweet content.
Hail, fair Asteria!
girt with isles around, Like Vesta stationed, and for peace renowned ;
Hail, Phœbus !
guardian of thy sacred shore ;
And hail the goddess whom Latona bore!
COME forth, come forth, ye virgins, and prepare
The bath for Pallas with assiduous care:
The goddess comes ;
from yon ethereal meads I hear the snorting of her fiery steeds, Come forth, come forth, ye brown Pelasgian maids ;
For bright Minerva never seeks the shades, Nor bathes her limbs in the refreshing flood, Till from her steeds she wash the dust and blood:
Not though th' immortal arms, as once before, Were stain'd with slaughter'd giants' reeking gore.
Nor till, unloosing from the car, she lave
The coursers' panting side in ocean's wave, And cleanse their mouths that gather'd foam distains, When, bounding swift, they shake the flowing reins.
Come forth, ye nymphs ;
no precious ointments bring, (I hear the wheels around her axles ring,) Nor oils, in alabaster smooth, prepare;
Nor oils nor unguents are Minerva's care;
She needs no glass;
her eyes are ever bright, Nor when the Phrygian youth on Ida's height, Misjudg'd the strife, did mighty Pallas gaze On polish'd brass, or Simois' watery maze;
Nor Jove's imperial queen :
but Venus fair Fond seiz'd the charm, and oft replac'd her hair.
Whilst Pallas drove around, and urg'd her steeds, Like Leda's offspring on Eurotas' meads;
Then o'er her limbs she pour'd ambrosial oil, The produce of her garden's fertile soil.
Behold, ye nymphs, the blushing morn arise More bright than roses' or pomegranates' dyes;
Bring forth the sacred oil that Castor us'd, And o'er Alcides manly strength diffus'd :
Bring forth the comb, that shines with yellow gold, To smooth her hairs, and curl each beauteous fold.
Come forth, Minerva;
lo !
thy virgins wait;
Acestor's offspring stand before the gate, And bear Tydicles' shield with holy hands, As once the good Eumedes gave commands, Thy favoured priest;
for when bad men combin'd Against his life, he fled, nor left behind Thy sacred image, which, with pious toil, He plao'd on lofty Creon's rocky soil;
On Creon's pointed cliffs, renown'd in fame, And call'd Palladian from thy sacred name.
Come forth, Minerva;
from whose golden helm Red lightning glances on the unhallow'd realm :
Come forth, Minerva;
pleased with war's alarms, The bounding courser, and the clang of arms.
This day, ye maids, the cleansing water bring, Not from the river, but the crystal spring.
This day, ye maids, at Physadea fill The brazen urn, or Amymone's rill:
For Inachus from yon green mountain pours
His waters, bright with gold, and gay with flowers, To fill the bath.
Pelasgian !
fly from harms, Nor, unpermitted, view Minerva's charms;
Lest, from your blind-struck eyes, she snatch away The towers of Argos, and the golden day.
Come forth, Minerva;
while to nymphs I sing A tale renown'd, and strike the vocal string.
Attend, ye maids.
-A nymph of Thebæ's town, Tiresias' mother, from Minerva won Distinguished love.
The sacred pair were join'd
In friendship sweet, the union of the mind.
And, when the power to Thespis urg'd her ste ds, To Haliartus, o'er Boeotia's meads, Or Coronea, by Curalius' flood, Where, near a breathing grove, her altar stood;
Still in the car the nymph attending rode.
Nor dance, nor social converse pleased the god, Unless her dear Chariclo led the way:
But she, with many tears, must shortly pay For Pallas' love, and woes attend behind.
For when the pair their shining veils unbind
To bathe their limbs in Hippocrene's rills (That softly flow from Heliconian hills)
At mid-day, when no breath was heard around, Nor from the mountain came the stillest sound;
At mid-day bathing, when the sun was bright, And silence reign'd, as at the noon of night;
The first soft down just rising on his face, Tiresias then with hounds approached the place, To quench his thirst in the refreshing streams, And undesign'd beheld their naked limbs:
Ah!
luckless youth;
for thus Minerva spoke, Though soft'ning pity smoothed her angry look.
Euerus' son !
what unpropitious god Has led thy steps to this retired abode ?
Some d emon urg'd thee, this unhappy day;
Doom'd hence no more to bear thy sight away.
She said:
thick darkness instant veil'd his eyes;
Amaz'd he stood, and speechless with surprise:
Black horror chill'd his limbs :
his mother mourn'd
With rage and grief, and furious thus returned:
What hast thou done ?
Is this Minerva's love ?
And this the kindness of the gods above ?
My son's bright eyes thou hast for ever closed, Because he saw thy beauteous limbs exposed.
Since he no more beholds ethereal day, No more my feet on yonder mountain stray;
Since he no more this happy scene shall view, Ye pendant rocks, ye falling rills, adieu !
Ah !
wretched mother ;
more unhappy son !
Revengeful goddess !
What could he have done ?
Thy worthless goats and hinds were once his prize;
For which, unpitying power, you seized his eyes !
She said :
with circling arms embraced her son,
And pour'd her sorrows, helpless and undone, As for her young sad Philomel complains, In mournful notes, and melancholy strains.
At her distress Minerva's eyes o'erflow, And thus she sooth'd her lov'd companion's woe.
Recall these hasty words, 0 nymph divine;
Thy son is blind, but not by my design.
The powers of heaven delight not to destroy, Nor snatch the light from, every beauteous boy:
Charge not, my friend, this dire mischance on me ;
For every man, by Saturn's stern decree, That, unpermitted, views the powers divine, Still makes atonement with an ample fine.
Before his birth, bright nymph, the Parcæ spun
This fatal thread for thy much-favour'd son.
Mourn not, Tiresias, though thy lot be hard, But for the deed receive a great reward.
What hecatombs would fair Cadmeïs burn?
Nor more would wretched Aristæus mourn
In after-times, when young Actaeon dies;
Could he return with only loss of eyes.
For though Diana's favourite in the cliace, And skilled, with her, to hunt a savage race, Yet when the youth, unwilling, tempts her wrath, And undesign' d beholds her in her bath, Nor chace nor sports avail:
she gives the word, And his fierce dogs devour their former lord.
Through lonesome woods the mother then shall rove, Collecting his white bones from every grove, And call thee blest, and not like her undone, That from the hills receives thy sightless son.
Then weep no more, 0 most belov'd of friends ;
A gift more glorious on that son attends, For great Minerva, from this happy hour, His breast irradiates with prophetic power, Illumes his mind, and grants him greater praise, Than e'er shall crown the seers of future days.
For he shall mark the wandering birds that fly To right, to left, along th' ethereal sky, Shall read their motions, as they swiftly spring, Observe the flight of each unprosperous wing, And utter sacred truths, in after-times, To Cadmus, Thebes, and fam'd Bœotia's climes.
A mystic staff shall guide his steps, and he Long life and honoured age obtains from me.
And when he dies, from him alone shall flow Prophetic truths in dismal realms below ;
While, still-inspir'd, he walks among the dead, And Pluto's self reveres the mighty shade.
She spoke, and bow'd her beauteous head, that still Confirms her vows;
for by Jove's awful will, Of all his daughters, goddesses in heaven, This honour only was to Pallas given;
That she, with him, might equal glory gain.
No mother bore her with a mother's pain, But her great father's head ;
and hence the god Still .gives, like him, th' irrevocable nod.
But now Minerva comes, nor comes unseen ;
Prepare, ye virgins, to receive your queen With acclamations, in this blissful hour, With vows and songs receive th' approaching power.
Hail!
guardian goddess, still let Argos claim
Thy kind protection, and adore thy name.
Whether, bright queen, thou lead'st thy fiery steeds From Argos towers along the verdant meads, Or back to yonder walls thy chariot runs, Still, still defend old Danaus' mighty sons.
THE basket swift-descending from the skies, Thus, thus, ye matrons, let your voices rise:
" Hail!
Ceres, hail!
by thee, from fertile ground Swift springs the corn, and plenty flows around."
Ye crowds, ye,t uninstructed, stand aloof, Nor view the pageant from the lofty roof, But on the ground below;
nor matrons fair, Nor youth, nor virgins, with dishevell'd hair, Dares here approach:
nor let the moisture flow From fasting mouths to stain the mystic show.
But radiant Hesper from the starry skies Beholds the sacred basket as it flies:
Bright Hesper only could persuade the power To quench her thirst, in that unhappy hour, When full of grief she roam'd from place to place, Her ravished daughter's latent steps to trace.
How could thy tender feet, 0 goddess, bear
The painful journey to the western sphere ?
How couldst thou tread black Æthiop's burning climes, Or that fair soil, in these distressful times, Where, on the tree, the golden apple beams, Nor eat, nor drink, nor bathe in cooling streams?
Thrice Achelous' flood her steps divide, And every stream that rolls a ceaseless tide.
Three times she pressed the centre of that isle, Where Ennasflowery fields with beauty smile.
Three times, by dark Challichorus, she sat, And called the yawning gulf to mourn her fate:
There, faint with hunger, laid her wearied limbs, Nor eat, nor drank, nor bath'd in cooling streams.
But cease, my Muse, in these unhallowed strains, To sing of Ceres' woes, and Ceres' pains;
Far nobler to resound her sacred laws, That blessed mankind, and gained their loud applause.
Far nobler to declare how first she bound
The sacred sheaves, and cut the corn around, How first the grain beneath the steer she laid, And taught Triptolemus the rural trade.
Far nobler theme (that all his crime may shun) To paint the woes of Triopas' proud son ;
How meagre famine o'er his visage spread, When her fierce vengeance on his vitals fed.
Not yet to Cnidia the Pelasgi came, But rais'd at Dotium to bright Ceres' name A sacred wood, whose branches interwove So thick, an arrow scarce could pierce the grove.
Here pines and elms luxuriant summits rear;
Here shone bright apples, there the verdant pear:
A crystal fountain pour'd his streams around, And fed the trees, and watered all the ground.
With wonder Ceres saw the rising wood, The spreading branches, and the silver flood, Which, more than green Triopium, gained her love, Than fair Eleusis, or bright Enna's grove.
But when, Incensed, his better genius fled From Erysichton, rash designs invade His impious breast:
he rush'd along the plain With twenty strong attendants in his train, Of more than mortal size, and such their power, As could with ease overturn the strongest tower With saws and axes arm'd they madly stood, And forc'd a passage through the sacred flood.
A mighty poplar raised his head on high Far o'er the rest, and seem'd to touch the sky (The nymphs at mid-day sported in the shade).
Here first they struck:
on earth the tree was laid, And told the rest her fate in doleful moans;
Indignant Ceres heard the poplar's groans, And thus with anger spoke:
What impious hand Has cut my trees, and my bright grove profan'd ?
She said, and instant, like Nicippa, rose, Her well-known priestess, whom the city chose;
Her holy hands the crowns and poppy bore ;
And from her shoulder hung the key before.
She came where Erysichton's rage began, And mildly thus addressed the wretched man.
My son, whoe'er thou art that wounds the trees, My son, desist, nor break high heaven's decrees:
By thy dear parent's love, recall thy train, Retire, my son, nor let me plead in vain :
Lest Ceres' wrath come bursting from above, In vengeance for her violated grove.
She said:
but scornful Erysichton burn'd With fiercer rage, and fiercer frowns return'd, Than the gaunt lioness (whose eyes they say Flash keener flames than all the beasts of prey) Casts on some hunter, when, with anguish torn, On Tmarus' hills her savage young are born.
Hence, hence, he cried, lest thy weak body feel
The fatal force of my resistless steel:
Above my dome the lofty trees shall shine, Where my companions the full banquet join, And sport and revel o'er the sparkling wine.
He said.
Fell Nemesis the speech records,
And vengeful Ceres heard th' insulting words;
Her anger burn'd:
her power she straight assum'd,
And all the goddess in full beauty bloom'd:
While to the skies her sacred head arose, She trod the ground, and rush'd amidst her foes.
The giant-woodmen, struck with deadly fear, That instant saw, that instant disappear, And left their axes in the groaning trees :
But unconcern'd their headlong flight she sees;
For these t' obey their lord the fences broke, To whom with dreadful voice the goddess spoke.
Hence, hence, thou dog, and hasten to thy home ;
There shape the trees, and roof the lofty dome :
There shalt thou soon unceasing banquets join, And glut thy soul with feasts and sparkling wine.
Her fatal words inflam'd his impious breast;
He rag'd with hunger like a mountain-beast:
Voracious famine his shrunk entrails tore, Devouring still, and still desiring more.
Unhappy wretch !
full twenty slaves of thine Must serve the feast, and twelve prepare the wine;
Bright Ceres' vengeance and stern Bacchus' rage Consum'd the man who durst their power engage :
For these combine against insulting foes, And fill their hearts with anguish and with woes.
His pious parents still excuses found
To keep their son from banquets given around.
And when th' Ormenides his presence call To Pallas' games, by sacred Iton's wall, Th' impatient mother still their suit denied.
The last revolving day she swift replied, To Cranon's town he went, and there receives An annual tribute of a hundred heaves.
Polyxo comes, the son and sire invites,
To grace her young Actorion's nuptial rites :
But soon the mournful mother thus replies, With tears of sorrow streaming from her eyes :
The royal Triopas will join thy feast ;
But Erysicliton lies with wounds opprest;
Nine days are past, since, with relentless tooth, A boar on Pindus gor'd the unhappy youth.
What fond excuses marked her tender care !
Did one the banquet or the feast prepare ?
My son is gone from home, the mother cries :
Was he invited to the nuptial ties ?
A discus struck him, from his steed he fell, Or numbers his white flocks in Othrys' dale.
Meanwhile the wretch, confin'd within the rooms, In never-ending feasts his time consumes, Which his insatiate maw devoured as fast, As down his throat the nourishment he cast;
But unrecruited still with strength or blood, As if in ocean's gulfs had sunk the food.
As snows from Mima's hills dissolving run, Or waxen puppets melt before the sun, So fast his flesh consumed, his vigour gone, And nervous fibres only clothed the bone.
His mother mourn'd ;
his sisters groans resum'd ;
His nurse and twenty handmaids wept around:
The frantic father rent his hoary hairs, And vainly thus to Neptune pour'd his prayers:
0 power divine, believ'd my sire in vain ;
Since thou reliev'st not thy descendant's pain :
If I from beauteous Canace may claim My sacred birth, or Neptune's greater name;
Behold a dire disease my son destroy:
Oh !
look with pity on the wretched boy.
Far happier fate, had Phoebus' vengeful dart Struck, with resistless force, his youthful heart;
For then my hands had funeral honours paid, And sacred rights to his departed shade.
But haggard famine with pale aspect now Stares in his eyes, and sits upon his brow.
Avert, 0 gracious power, the dire disease, Or feed my wretched son in yonder seas.
No more my hospitable feasts prevail, My folds are empty, and my cattle fail.
My menial train will scarce the food provide;
The mules no more my rushing chariot guide.
A steer his mother fed within the stall, At Vesta's sacred altar doom'd to fall, This he devoured, and next my warlike horse, So oft victorious in the dusty course.
Ev'n puss escaped not, when his fury rose, Herself so dreadful to domestic foes.
Long as his father's house supplied the feast Th' attendants only knew the dreadful waste.
But when pale famine fill'd th' imperial dome, Th' insatiate glutton was expell'd from home, And, though from kings descended, rueful sat In public streets, and begg'd at every gate:
Still at the feast his suppliant hands were spread, And still the wretch on sordid refuse fed.
Immortal Ceres !
for thine impious foe Ne'er let my breast with sacred friendship glow.
Beneath my roof the wretch shall never prove A neighbour's kindness, or a neighbour's love.
Ye maids and matrons, thus with sacred song, Salute the pageant as it comes along.
" Hail!
Ceres, hail!
by thee from fertile ground Swift springs the corn, and plenty flows around."
As four white coursers to thy hallow'd shrine
The sacred basket bear ;
so, power divine, Let Spring and Summer, rob'd in white, appear;
Let fruits in Autumn crown the golden year, That we may still the sprightly juice consume, To soothe our cares in Winter's cheerless gloom.
As we, with feet unshod, with hair unbound, In long procession tread the hallow'd ground;
May thus our lives in safety still be led, 0 shower thy blessings on each favour'd head !
As matrons bear the baskets fill'd with gold, Let boundless wealth in every house be told.
Far as the Prytaneum the power invites
The women uninstructed in the rites;
Then dames of sixty years (a sacred throng) Shall to the temple lead the pomp along.
Let those who for Lucina's aid extend Imploring arms, and those in pain attend Far as their strength permits;
to them shall come Abundant bliss, as if they reach'd the dome.
Hail, sacred power!
preserve this happy town
In peace and safety, concord and renown:
Let rich increase o'erspread the yellow plain ;
Feed flocks and herds, and fill the ripening grain :
Let wreaths of olive still our brows adorn,
And those who ploughed the field shall reap the corn.
Propitious, hear my prayer, 0 Queen supreme, And bless thy poet with immortal fame.
THE sage who view'd the shining heavens on high, Explor'd the glories of th' expanded sky ;
Whence rise the radiant orbs, where still they bend
Their wandering course, and where at length descend, Why dim eclipse obscures the blazing sun, Why stars at certain times to darkness run, How Trivia nightly stole from realms above To taste on Latmos' rocks the sweets of love, Immortal Conon, blest with skill divine, Amid the sacred skies behold.
me shine, Ev'n me, the beauteous hair, that lately shed Refulgent beams from Berenice's head;
The lock she fondly vow'd with lifted arms, Imploring all the powers to save from harms
Her dearer lord, when from his bride he flew, To wreak stern vengeance on th' Assyrian crew;
While yet the monarch bore the pleasing scars
Of softer triumphs and nocturnal wars.0 sacred queen, do virgins still despise
The joys of Venus, and the nuptial ties, When oft in bridal-rooms their sighs and tears Disturb the parent's heart with anxious fears ?
The tears descend from friendly powers above;
The sighs, ye gods !
are only sighs of love.
With tears like these fair Berenice mourned, When, for her virgin-spoils, the monarch burned ;
With sighs like these she gave him all her charms, And bless'd the raptur'd bridegroom in her arms.
But on the widow'd bed you wept alone, And mourned the brother in the husband gone.
What sorrow then my pensive queen opprest, What pangs of absence tore her tender breast!
When, lost in woe, no trace remained behind
Of all her virgin-mirth, and strength of mind.
Hadst thou forgot the deed thy worth achieved, For which thy brows th' imperial crown received ;
The wondrous deed, that plac'd thee far beyond
Thy fair compeers, and made a monarch fond ?
But when for wars he left your tender arms,
What words you spoke, with what endearing charms, Still breathed your soft complaints in mournful sighs, And wip'd, with lifted hands, your streaming eyes.
Didst thou, fair nymph, lament by power divine, Or for an absent lover only pine ?
Then to the gods you vow'd with pious care
A sacred offering, your immortal hair, With blood of slaughtered bulls, would heaven restore
Your lord in triumph to his native shore ;
Should he, returning soon with high renown, Add vanquished Asia to th* Egyptian crown :
And I, fair lock, from orbs of radiance, now Diffuse new light to pay thy former vow.
But hear, 0 Queen, the sacred oath I swear, By thy bright head, and yet remaining hair, doute I join'd unwilling this ethereal sphere ;
)
And well I know what woes the perjur'd feel:
But none can conquer unresisted steel.
Steel hew'd the mightiest mountain to the ground That Sol beholds in his diurnal round, Through Athos' rocky sides a passage tore, When first the Medes arriv'd at Phthia's shore:
Then winds and waves drove their swift ships along, And through the new-made gulf impelled the throng, If these withstood not steel's all-conquering blow, What could thy hairs against so dire a foe ?
0 mighty Jove !
may still thy wrath divine
Pour fierce destruction on their impious line, Who dug with hands accurst the hollow mine;
Who first from earth could shining ore produce, First tempered steel, and taught its various use.
As thy bright locks bewail'd their sister gone, Arsinoë's horseman, Memnon's only son, On fluttering wings descended from on high, To bear the beauteous hairs above the sky;
Then upward bent his flight, and softly plac'd
Thy radiant lock in chaste Arsinoë's breast, Whom we Zephyritis and Venus name;
And on Canopus' shores her altars flame:
Where late the winged messenger came down
At her desire, lest Ariadne's crown Should still unrivall'd glitter in the skies ;
And that thy precious hairs, a richer prize, The spoils devoted to the powers divine, Might from the fields of light as brightly shine.
Yet bath'd in tears I wing'd my rapid flight, Swift from her shrine, to this ethereal height, And, placed amidst the fair celestial signs, Thy lock for ever with new glory shines, Just by the Virgin in the starry sphere, The savage Lion, and the Northern Bear;
Full to the west, with sparkling beams, I lead, And bright Boötes in my course precede.
Who scarcely moves along the ethereal plain, And late and slowly sinks beneath the main.
Though feet of gods surround my throne by night, And in the seas I sleep with morning light, Yet, 0 Rhamnusian maid, propitious hear The words of sacred truth unaw'd by fear, The words of truth I wish not to conceal, But still the dictates of my breast reveal, )
Though these resplendent orbs in wrath should rise, And hurl me headlong from the flaming skies.
Though placed on high, sad absence I deplore, Condemned to join my lovely queen no more, On whose fair head, while yet in virgin-bloom, I drank unmeasured sweets and rich perfume.
But now, ye maids, and every beauteous dame, For whom on nuptial nights the torches flame, Though fondly wedded to some lovely boy, Your virgin-choice, and partner of your joy, Forbear to taste the pleasures of a bride, Nor from the bosoms draw the veil aside, Till oils in alabaster ye prepare, And chastely pour on Berenice's hair:
But I th' impure adulteress still confound, And dash th' ungrateful offering to the ground.
From her no rich libation I demand,
And scorn the gift of each unhallowed hand.
But if the virtuous fair invoke my power, Unbounded bliss shall crown the nuptial hour;
To her shall concord from high heaven descend, And constant love her soft retreats attend.
And when, bright Queen, on solemn feasts your eyes Shall hail Arsinoë radiant in the skies;
When she demands, bright opening on your view, The sacred rights to heavenly Venus due;
If thy lov'd lock appear resplendent there, Let me with her an equal offering share.
But why should these surrounding stars detain
Thy golden hairs in this ethereal plain ?
Oh could I join thy beauteous head once more, The sacred head on which I grew before, hough I should ever lose my light divine, And moist Arcturus next the Virgin shine.
A Y )UTH in haste to Mitylene came, And anxious, thus revealed his amorous flame To Pittacus the wise:
0 sacred Sire, For two fair nymphs I burn with equal fire, One lovely maid in rank and wealth like me, But one superior, and of high degree.
Since both return my love, and each invites
To celebrate with her the nuptial rites, Perplex'd with doubts, for sage advice I come:
Whom shall I wed?
'Tis you must fix my doom.
So spake th' impatient youth;
th' attentive sage Rais'd the support of his declining age, An ancient staff;
and pointing to the ground
Where sportive striplings lash'd their tops around With eager strokes;
Let yonder boys, he cried, Solve the dispute, and your long doubts decide.
The youth drew nigh, and listened with surprise, Whilst from the laughing crowd these words arise, Let equal tops with equal tops contend.
The boys prevailed, and soon the contest end.
The youth departing shunn'd the wealthy dame, And chose th' inferior maid to quench his flame.
Go thou, my friend, obey the sage, and lead
An equal beauty to thy nuptial bed.
I HEAR, 0 friend, the fatal news Of Heraclitus' death.
A sudden tear my cheek bedews,
And sighs suppress my breath.
For I must often call to mind, How from the crowd we run ;
And how, to jesting still inclined, We sported in the sun.
Alas!
he's gone, and part we must, And repartee's no more;
But, though my friend be sunk in dust, His muse shall ever soar.
The dart of death shall never fly To stop her waving wings;
Like Philomel she mounts on high, And still, like her, she sings.
I, TIMON, hated human race;
Ye passengers, begone, Curse as ye will, but leave the place, And let me rest alone.
SAY, Timon, sunk in night, abhorr'st thou now The light above, or gloomy shades below ? "
I hate the shades, since fill'd with human-kind In greater numbers than I left behind."
A SACRED shell, Zephyritis divine, Fair Selenæa offers at thy shrine, And thus thy Nautilus is doubly blessed, Since given by her, and still by thee possessed.
Of late small tackling from my body grew;
Thin sails I spread, when winds propitious blew, But when the seas were calm, to gain the shores I stretched my little feet, like labouring oars, And, from my busy limbs and painted pride, Was call'd a Polyp as I stemm'd the tide;
Till driven by winds, on Coan rocks I shone, And now recline before Arsinoë's throne.
Deprived of life, no more in seas I rest, Or draw young Halcyons from the watery nest;
But be this boon to Clinias' daughter given, A virtuous maid and favourite of high heaven;
The precious boon let Selenæa gain, When she from Smyrna ploughs the foaming main.
A SAMIAN gave me birth, the sacred bard
Whose hospitable feast great Homer shar'd ;
For beauteous Iole my sorrows flow, And royal Eurytus oppressed with woe:
But mightier names my lasting fame shall crown, And Homer give Creophilus renown.
A PIOUS youth approaching where His stepdame's body lay, Officious crowned her statue there With flow'rets fresh and gay ;
Nor thought his father's wife, when dead, Her malice could retain:
The statue thundered on his head And fix'd him to the plain.
Ye foster-sons, avoid his doom, Nor hang a flow'ry wreath Around an envious stepdame's tomb, Lest ye too sink in death.
No wreaths of ivy Theætetus crown, Who chose the certain path to high renown ;
Unskilful judges his great worth despise, And undeserving bards obtain the prize:
Yet envy not, my friend, their short-liv'd fame;
Admiring Greece shall still resound thy name.
THE fewest words are still exprest
By him who gain'd at Bacchus' feast, He says in simple phrase, "I've won." But Phœbus' more unlucky son, Whose prize is gone, whose hopes are crost.
Should any ask how he had lost, On fickle fortune throws the blame, And tells in long harangues his claim:
No judges hence the prize assign ;
Oh may the shortest phrase be mine.
BENEATH this tomb, in sacred sleep, The virtuous Saon lies;
Ye passengers, forbear to weep, A good man never dies.
SAY, dost thou seek Timarchus now, To talk with him in shades below Of truths before unknown to thee, As, Where th' immortal mind must be ?
Go, search the fam'd Elysian plain For ancient Ptolemæus' train, You '11 find him there (his body's dust) Amid th' assemblies of the just.
HERE
Theris lies in endless rest;
A little spot contains the guest, Once victor in th' equestrian strife, And now has reach'd the goal of life.
His body short, his tomb not long, And short, like them, shall be my song.
WHEN you, my friend, to Cyzicus repair, Good Hippacus and Didyme the fair Are found with ease, amid th' extended town, Since both descend from sires of great renown:
Then sadly tell their son's untimely doom, For youthful Critias lies beneath this tomb.
Stranger.
WHERE'S Charidas buried?
I speak without fear.
Monument.
The son of Arimnas lies mouldering here.
Stranger.
0 tell me, good Charidas, what's in thy tomb?
Charidas.
Inquisitive mortal, there's nothing but gloom.
Sir.
Say, wilt thou return?—
Char.
Wicked trifler, begone.
Str. What's Pluto?— Char.
A fable, and we are undone.
If there's pleasure in death, and sure I speak true, Pellæus' fat ox will be happy as you.
WHO knows if any power will give Another day for him to live ?
Lo !
Charmus, late our dearest friend, To-day shall to the grave descend;
And tears, alas !
bring no relief
To soothe his mournful father's grief.
By all the gods, I ne'er had known
Who this Timonoë was, Had not her father's name been shown In monumental brass.
Methymne too, the city's name, EngraveD on her tomb With old Timotheus, gives to fame Her much-lamented doom.
Though time will some relief impart
To soothe a father's woe, Deep sorrow rends her husband's heart, His tears for ever flow.
THE Samian virgins us'd often to play With Crethis the witty, the pleasant, and gay, But now, when they seek her, she cannot be found;
Their sportive companion sleeps here under ground, Discharging the debt which to nature we owe;
For all must descend to the regions below.
HAD never vessel cross'd the main.
Our present grief had been in vain ;
But we for Sopolis must weep, Now plung'd beneath the whelming deep.
The surges toss his breathless frame;
An empty tomb preserves his name.
NOT on the land could Lycus die, Nor in his native Naxos lie, But on the main by tempests tost, His life and ship together lost, When first he left Ægina's shore, And o'er him now the surges roar:
An empty marble only keeps
His name from the devouring deeps.
Obey my words and shun the seas, Ye mariners, in times like these, When to the main the Goat declines, Nor in the sky with Phœbus shines.
NICOTELES lies buried here, Philippus o'er him drops a tear, And mourns his twelfth and only boy, The father's hope, his pride and joy.
THIS morning we beheld with streaming eyes
The flames from Melanippus' body rise;
At eve fair Basile resigned her breath, Disdaining to survive a brother's death ;
With frantic hands she gave the deadly blow That sent her soul to gloomy shades below.
Two mighty ills the wretched sire must mourn, And weep around a son and daughter's urn;
Old Aristippus sunk in grief appears, And old Cyrene melts in briny tears.
WHOE'ER with hallow'd feet approaches near, Behold, Callimachus lies buried here.
I drew my breath from fam'd Cyrene's shore, And the same name my son and father bore.
My warlike sire in arms much glory won,
But brighter trophies grac'd his favoured son ;
Lov'd by the tuneful nine he sweetly sung, And stopt the venom of th' invidious tongue:
For whom the muse beholds with favouring eyes
In early youth, she'll ne'er again despise.
O'ER Cretan hills a virgin chanc'd to stray, And bore the swain Astacides away, To Dicte's wood his instant flight compels, Where under rustling oaks a priest he dwells :
Ye shepherds, cease to sing in Daphne's praise;
To fam'd Astacides your voices raise.
CLEOMBROTUS, high on a rock, Above Ambracia stood, Bade Sol adieu, and, as he spoke, Plung'd headlong in the flood.
From no mischance the leap he took, But sought the realms beneath, Because he read in Plato's book, That souls live after death.
SMALL is my size, and I must grace Eëtion's porch, a little place ;
A hero's likeness I appear, And round my sword a serpent bear.
But since Eëtion views with hate
The prancing steed that caus'd my fate, Resolv'd that we no more should meet, He plac'd me here upon my feet.
FOND Callignotus sighed and swore, 'Tis Violante I adore, The brightest beauty on the plain, And she alone my heart shall gain.
He swore;
but lovers' vows, they say, To heaven could never make their way, Nor penetrate the bless'd abode, Nor reach the ears of any god.
While for another maid he burns, Forsaken Violante mourns
Her blasted hopes, her honour gone;
As Megra's race were once undone.
SHORT was my life, and Micylus my name;
I gained with little wealth a poet's fame, And wisely passed without offence my time, Friend to the good, unconscious of a crime.
If e'er I prais'd the bad, revenge it now, Thou mother earth, and all ye powers below ;
Lie not, 0 goddess, lightly on my breast, Nor let th' infernal furies grant me rest.
THIS book is sure exactly wrote In Hesiod's manner, style, and thought, Of Grecian poets not the least, And here his powers are all exprest.
I fear, my friend, you say too much;
His verse is soft, his genius such That Soli's son will find it hard To emulate so sweet a bard.
Farewell Aratus' empty themes,
His idle thoughts, and heavy dreams.
HATE the bard who strolls along, And sells in streets his borrowed song;
I seldom walk the public way, Where here and there the vulgar stray , Inconstant friends I never court, Nor to the common spring resort;
I still despise the rabble's rage, Nor with the noisy crowd engage.
'Tis fine, 'tis fine, a reader cries:
Indignant Echo thus replies, Though ne'er so good, perhaps divine, Another bard wrote every line.
POUR the wine, and drink it up, But mix no water in the cup;
The sacred cup we fill with joy To thee, Diocles, beauteous boy :
0 more than beauteous, youth divine, Should all refuse to drink the wine, Should all refuse thy charms to see, Then would the boy be left with me.
CLEONICUS, unhappy man, Say whence thy sorrows first began ?
For, by yon blazing orb of light, I ne'er beheld so sad a sight.
Where hast thou been ?
thy flesh is gone,
And nothing left but skin and bone.
My daemon sure, and hapless fate, Redue'd thee to this wretched state;
Eusithea stole thy heart, like mine;
When first you saw the nymph divine, You gaz'd on her with wishful eyes, And hence, I fear, your woes arise.
THE huntsman o'er the hills pursues
The timid hare, and keenly views
The tracks of hinds amid the snow, Nor heeds the wint'ry winds that blow.
But should a stranger mildly say, Accept the game I killed to-day,- The proffer'd gift he quickly scorns, And to th' uncertain chace returns:
Such is my love;
I never prize
An easy fair, but her who flies.
THAT I am poor is known to me, My good Menippus, as to thee;
Then, by our love, insist no more
On what I knew too well before:
Such truths offend a stranger's ear, But to a friend are most severe.
PLACED here by Phileratis' hands,
This image of Diana stands;
Accept the gift, attend her prayer, And still, 0 goddess, guard the fair.,Club.
A STRANGER cut me from a tree A beechen club, a gift to thee, Who stopt the roaring lion's breath, And laid the foaming boar in death.
Here.
Declare his country, and his name.
Club.
Archinus he;
from Crete he came.
Here.
And, for the pious giver's sake, The proffer'd gift I freely take.
APPROACH this tomb with silent feet, The dead Batt jades to greet;
Alive, renown'd for sacred song, And mirth to charm the festive throng,TWICE Erasixen fill'd his cup, And twice he drank the liquor up;
He drank his wine, but much too deep, And clos'd his eyes in endless sleep.
MENMETAS, tir'd with war's alarms, Gave to the gods his shining arms, And said, this quiver and this bow On thee, Serapis, I bestow ;
This empty quiver ;
for my darts
Are all infix'd in hostile hearts.
SILENA, changeful as the sea, Bright Venus, dedicates to thee Her image, and the zone that bound Her swelling breast with beauty crown'd.
ACRISIUS of Pelasgian race To Ceres rais'd this holy place, Where Timodemus pays his vow To her, and Proserpine below:
Triumphant from his naval toil, He gives the tenth of every spoil.
WHOE'ER shall to this tomb draw nigh, Behold, in death, a priestess lie:
I sacred Ceres first implor'd, The great Cabin next ador'd, Grew old on Dindymene's plains, And now my dust alone remains.
Alive, I seldom fail'd to lead
The sprightly dance along the mead;
I bore two sons, I ran my race, And died with joy, in their embrace.
Go, friend ;
prepare for life's decline;
And may thy death be blest as mine.
I BREATHE in sighs;
for half my soul
By love or death was lately stole:
Perhaps the fool, too surely gone, Is now possessed by love alone, And to some beauteous boy draws nigh, From whom I warned him oft to fly.
Retire, my soul, lest thou shouldst prova
The pangs of unsuccessful love;
For well I know thou'It soon return
In anguish, and dismissed with scorn.
IF sober, and inclin'd to sport, To you, my fair one, I resort;
The still-forbidden bliss to prove, Accuse me then, and blame my love.
But if to rashness I incline, Accuse me not, but blame the wine:
When love and wine at once inspire, What mortal can control his fire ?
Of late I came, I know not how, Embraced my fair, and kissed her too;
It might be wrong ;
I feel no shame, And, for the bliss, will bear the blame.
BEHOLD our host by love depriv'd of rest, A secret wound deep-rankling in his breast;
He breathes in sighs, oppressed by power divine, And thrice the thirsty earth has drank the wine.
Lo !
from his neck the rosy garlands fade, And on the ground the withering leaves are spread s
He burns, he burns;
as I too surely know, That oft have felt a lover's pains and woe.
By mighty Pan and Bacchus' greater name, Beneath these embers lurks a spreading flame.
Embrace me not;
though streams in silence fall
They sap the basis of the best built wall:
Embrace me not;
lest this invading fire Should be but love, and fiercer flames inspire.
WHEN Archestrata's charms I first surveyed, By heaven, said he, this is no beauteous maid;
Nor seem'd she fair, when view'd with careless eye ;
But vengeful Nemesis stood listening by, Cut short my speech, and swift within my heart Infixed, like fire from Jove, her fatal dart.
I burn, I burn;
shall I the power appease, Or strive with blandishments the fair to please ?
Could I, my fair, thy blooming charms enjoy, The dart of Nemesis would prove a joy.
JULY the twentieth lately past, This flying fair must yield at last, I fondly said ;
but ere the sun Had half his course in August run, She came all bright in blooming charms, And rush'd spontaneous to my arms, By Hermes led:
0 guardian power, Thy sacred name I still adore, And since that long-expected day No more lament the short delay.
THUS Giant Polyphemus sweetly sung,
While o'er the cliffs his goats untended hung:
The muse to hopeless love is ever kind;
The power of wisdom heals a wounded mind, And meagre famine brings this only good, It calms the pulse, and cools the glowing blood.
Mischievous boy, my thoughts no more shall rove ;
I '11 clip with these the fluttering wings of love, Despise thy power, swift hasten home, and there With wisdom and the muse dispel my care.
LOUD shouts from th' Acamantian choir proclaim, At Bacchus' feast, the joyful victor's name;
For him they weave the Dithyrambic crown, A wreath of roses adds to his renown, And, more to recompense his toil, they shed The sacred unguents o'er the poet's head, Who now victorious gives this lasting sign, This golden tripod to the power divine.
Antigenes instructs the crowds beneath;
But wise Aristo's ever tuneful breath Could sweeter sounds in Doric reeds inspire:
Hipponichus was leader of the choir, Above the rest he shone superior far, The Graces bore him in their airy car, Obey'd the Muses, and the bard renown'd
The Muses with unfading violets crown'd.
ESCAP'D the horrors of a watery grave, To Samothracian gods Eudemus gave His little skiff;
and said, Ye mighty powers, Accept my gift;
the votive gift is yours.
As youthful Sinus gave me to the Nine, He said, Ye Muses, grant me light divine;
And these accepting, like brave Glaucus, soon For the small gift returned a greater boon.
But, with dishevell'd locks, I stand and stare Against the doubtful Samian letter there.
To me the boys address their ardent prayers, And cry, 0 Bacchus, sacred be thy hairs;
But I no more attend these idle themes,
Than if they told me last night's empty dreams.
STRANGER, wouldst thou my story know ?
Behold, I stand a comic show;
And Pamphilus within this place Must Ag'ranax's victory grace:
Although I seem not very fine, Nor is the workmanship divine ;
For half like shrivell'd figs appears, And half to soot resemblance bears.
THUS Micus chose to reimburse Old Phrygian Æschra, once his nurse:
Alive the dame on dainties fed;
He placed an image o'er her dead;
That late posterity may know What kindness we to nurses owe.
FOUR are the Graces now;
and all may see Another added to the former three, Yet wet with unguents, and but lately born ;
Fair Berenice, blooming as the morn, So bright with charms, and such her beauteous face, That, robb'd of her, the Graces lose their grace.
THEOCRITUS looks black, 'tis true;
But then his face is comely too:
If he hate me, your love is such, You hate him just four times as mucn ;
But if he love, you love him then Beyond the love of mortal men.
And such, I swear, 0 mighty Jove, By sacred Ganymede above, The friendship once to him you bore, And such the love;
I speak no more.
LUCINA, grant thy aid again, Nor let Lycænis call in vain;
To thee, propitious power, I bow, And for a daughter thank thee now:
But if, bright Queen, a boy were mine, A greater gift should grace thy shrine.
WHAT for Demodice was ow'd, On Æsculapius is bestow'd ;
Aceson ow'd it for her charms, Since first he revell'd in her arms.
And, says the picture, should he choose
No more t' approach his lovely spouse, The fair would still his praise deserve, Nor from the rules of virtue swerve.
AN ever-living lamp I shine To Canopista, power divine;
With twenty matches I appear, And Crita's daughter placed me here, To pay what for her son she ow'd, What, for Appelles, late she vow'd:
And when my light you first espy, You'd swear the stars had left the sky,EVÆNETUS declared that he, For battles won, devoted me, A brazen cock, within this place To Tyndaris' immortal race.
But Phædrus' son I love and fear, And, as my guardian god, revere.
FAIR Æschylis, from Thale sprung, In Isis' fane an offering hung;
And thus the vow her mother mado, Irene's vow, is fully paid.
WHOE'ER thou art in tempests lost, And driv'n ashore by surges tost, Leontichus laments thy doom, And lays thy body in this tomb;
But mourns his own unhappy state, Expos'd, like thee, to certain fate:
Expos'd to plo ugh the watery plain, Or, like a sea-mew, skim the main.
THE following pages are taken from a work by the Right Hon, John Hookham Frere, entitled THEOGNIS RESTITUTUS, printed at Malta, 1842.
THE verses of Theognis which in a regular arrangement of his Fragments appear entitled to stand as the first of the series, are those which represent him as a prosperous young heir just enter­ ing into life, and looking forward to the enjoyment of pleasure and happiness.
His vows are addressed to Jupiter as the sovereign deity, and to his own immediate patron, Apollo, the founder and protector of Megara.—
We shall see, that at a later period (in an­ ticipation of the Persian invasion) his vows are addressed sepa­ rately to the same two deities.
His amusements and accomplishments at this time, his fond­ ness for the pipe, which he delighted to accompany, and the lyre, are expressed in another fragment.
My heart exults the lively call obeying, 531-4
When the shrill merry pipes are sweetly playing :
With these to chaunt aloud, or to recite, To carol and carouse is my delight:
Or in a stedfast tone, bolder and higher, To temper with a touch the manly lyre.
Other verses, evidently composed in his early years, terminate in professing his fondness for this kind of music.
To revel with the pipe, to chaunt and sing, 1060-4
This likewise is a most delightful thing—Give me but ease and pleasure !
What care I For reputation or for property ?
The eagerness of Theognis in the pursuit of knowledge is strongly marked in a passage which (in whatever period it may have been produced) serves to indicate a feeling, which is always strongest in early youth.
Theognis, after a successful intrigue, determines to extend the range of his gallantries.
My thirst was sated at a secret source, 953-6 I found it clear and limpid;
but its course
Is altered now;
polluted and impure !
I leave it;
and where other springs allure Shall wander forth;
or freely quaff my fill From the loose current of the flowing rill.
We may now proceed to the congenial and equally edifying subject of wine.
Even here Theognis exhibits traces of a peculiar mind, in a tendency to general remark and fixed method.
The following lines are curious, as affording a chronological ap­ proximation.
Onomacritus to whom they are addressed, (but whose name could not easily be brought into an English verse,) w as a favourite of Hipparchus, but afterwards banished by him for a sacrilegious forgery.
Being at the time the Curator of a collec­ tion of oracles in the possession of the sons of Pisistratus, he had been detected in a wilful interpolation.
-If we take the middle of the fourteen years of Hipparchus' reign as the probable date of these lines, they would have been composed by Theognis at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four, which, considering the nature of the subject, seems probable enough.
My brain grows dizzy, whirled and overthrown 503-8 With wine;
my senses are no more my own;
The ceiling and the walls are wheeling round.
But, let me try!—perhaps my limbs are sound:
Let me retire, with my remaining sense, For fear of idle language and offence.
The next fragment is addressed to Simonides;
invited to Athens by Hipparchus, and attached to his service by liberal presents.
Onomacritus and he were probably joint visitors at Megara, or Theognis might have joined their society at Athens.
The lines seem to have been written about the same time, and during the same paroxysm of experimental conviviality, as the preceding.
Theognis, who in his own opinion is not more drunk than a man ought to be, remonstrates with Simonides, who, being president of the meeting and further advanced in liquor, had become overbear­ ing and absurd.
Theognis, as in the former fragment, takes his leave, being apprehensive of exceeding the precise bounds of in­ ebriety which he had prescribed to himself.
Never oblige your company to stay !
467-96 Never detain a man;
nor send away, Nor rouse from his repose, the weary guest, That sinks upon the couch with wine opprest!
These formal rules enforc'd, against the will, Are found offensive-let the bearer fill Just as we please-freely to drink away ;
Such merry meetings come not every day.
For me ;
--since for to-night my stint is finish d, Before my common sense is more diminished;
I shall retire (the rule, I think, is right)
Not absolutely drunk, nor sober quite.
For he that drinks beyond the proper point Puts his own sense and judgment out of joint, Talking outrageous, idle, empty stuff (The mere effect of wine more than enough);
Telling a thousand things, that on the morrow
He recollects with sober shame and sorrow:
At other times, and in his proper nature, An easy, quiet, amiable creature.
Now you, Simonides, mind what I say !
You chatter in your cups and prate away, Like a poor slave, drunk on a holiday.
You never can resolve to leave your liquor, The faster it comes round, you drink the quicker—
There's some excuse-"
The slave has fill'd the cup, A challenge-or a pledge"—you drink it up ! "
'Tis a libation -and you're so devout, You can't refuse it!
—Manly brains and stout Might stand the trial, drinking hard and fast, And keep their sense and judgment to the last.
Farewell!
be merry !
may your hours be spent
Without a quarrel or an argument, In inoffensive, easy merriment;
I Like a good concert, keeping time and measure, Such entertainments give the truest pleasure.
We now proceed to his moral and political verses, which ( as mankind are usually more ashamed of wisdom than of folly, or from prudential reasons more cautious in concealing it) seem to have been suppressed for a time, and to have been communicated to his most intimate friend under an injunction of secrecy.
Kurnus, these lines of mine, let them remain 19-28 Conceal'd and secret-verse of such a strain Betrays its author-all the world would know it ! "
This is Theognis, the Megarian poet, So celebrated and renown'd in Greece !"
Yet some there are, forsooth, I cannot please;
Nor ever could contrive, with all my skill, To gain the common liking and goodwill
Of these my fellow-citizens.—
No wonder!
Not even he, the god that wields the thunder, (The sovereign all-wise, almighty Jove,) Can please them with his government above:
Some call for rainy weather, some for dry, A discontented and discordant cry Fills all the earth, and reaches to the sky.
)In a passage preserved to us by Stobceus, Xenophon, after quoting from the preceding fragment the fourth line of the trans­ lation, proceeds to connect it with the fragment which follows;
explaining it in his own manner. "
These are the verses of Theog­ nis of Megara.»—«
The subject which the poet seems to me to have had in view appears to have been simply a treatise on the good and bad qualities of mankind.
He treats of man in the same manner as a writer would do of any other animal (of horses, for instance);
his exordium seems to me a perfectly proper one;
for he begins with the subject of breed;
considering that neither men nor any other animals are likely to prove good for anything, un­ less they are produced from a good stock.
He illustrates his principle by a reference to those animals in which breed is strictly attended to;
these lines, therefore, are not merely an invective against the mercenary spirit of his countrymen, (as the generality of readers imagine,) they seem to me to be directed against the negligence and ignorance of mankind in the management and economy of their own species.
Such was the judgment of Xeno­ phon upon this passage ;
different, as it should seem, from that of is countrymen and contemporaries.
But we must recollect that the maintenance of a physical and personal superiority was considered as a point of paramount im­ portance by all the aristocracies of Doric race.
The Spartans, the most perfect type of such an aristocracy, reared no infants who appeared likely to prove defective in form ;
and condemned their king Archidamus to a fine, for having married a diminutive wife.
Xenophon himself speaks of it elsewhere as a well-known fact, that the Spartans were eminently superior in strength and comeli­ ness of person.
-As a result of this principle, we can account for what would otherwise appear a very singular circumstance,-that the most eminent of the Olympic champions upon record, Diago- ras and Milo, were both of the most distinguished families in their native Doric states, Rhodes and Crotona.
—Xenophon, therefore, who considered Theognis as belonging to a Doric aristocracy, and who was himself a Dorian in his habits and partialities, interprets him more in a physical than in a moral sense, and considers mis­ alliances as a cause rather than a consequence of the debasement of the higher orders.
With kine and horses, Kurnus!
we proceed 183-96 By reasonable rules, and choose a breed For profit and increase, at any price;
Of a sound stock, without defect or vice.
But, in the daily matches that we make, The price is everything;
for money's sake Men marry;
women are in marriage given:
The churl or ruffian that in wealth has thriven May match his offspring with the proudest race:
Thus everything is mix'd, noble and base !
If then in outward manner, form, and mind, You find us a degraded, motley kind, Wonder no more, my friend!
the cause is plain, And to lament the consequence is vain.
From birth we proceed to education.
Here we find Theognis taking the same side with Pindar and Euripides in a question which seems to have been long agitated in the heathen world,- Whether Virtue and Vice were innate ?
concluding, like them, for the affirmative.
This fragment is separated from the preceding.
Yet, according to the opinions of those times, there was a con­ nexion between them, and the process of thought is continuous.
The existence of the evil had been stated, and the poet proceeds to argue that it is not capable of being remedied by human con­ trivance.
—After which, in two succeeding fragments, we shall see him following the cause into its consequences, as exemplified in the degradation of the higher orders, and the comparative eleva­ tion of their former inferiors.
To rear a child is easy, but to teach 429-38 Morals and manners is beyond our reach;
To make the foolish wise, the wicked good, That science never yet was understood.
The sons of Esculapius, if their art Could remedy a perverse and wicked heart, Might earn enormous wages !
But, in fact, The mind is not compounded and compact
Of precept and example;
human art In human nature has no share or part.
Hatred of vice, the fear of shame and sin, Are things of native growth, not grafted in:
Else wise and worthy parents might correct
In children's hearts each error and defect:
Whereas we see them disappointed still, No scheme nor artifice of human skill Can rectify the passions or the will.
We now come to those fragments which must have occasioned the injunctions of secrecy in fragm.
IX., and which mark the pe­ culiarity of the authors mind.
He distinctly prognosticates an approaching revolution, origin­ ating in the misrule of the party to which he himself naturally belonged;
and of which his friend Kurnus was, if not the actual, the anticipated chief;
for we shall see him driven from his coun­ try at an early age, after having been for some time at the head of the state.
-He warns him of the rising intelligence and spirit of the lower orders;
the feebleness, selfishness, and falsehood of the high­ er ;
and the discontent which their mode of government was ex­ citing.
Our commonwealth preserves its former frame, 53-68 Our common people are no more the same :
They that in skins and hides were rudely dressy
Nor dreamt of law, nor sought to be redressed By rules of right, but in the days of old Flock'd to the town, like cattle to the fold, Are now the brave and wise;
and we, the rest, (Their betters nominally, once the best,) Degenerate, debas'd, timid, and mean !
Who can endure to witness such a scene ?
Their easy courtesies, the ready smile, Prompt to deride, to flatter, and beguile!
Their utter disregard of right or wrong, Of truth or honour!
-Out of such a throng (For any difficulties, any need, For any bold design or manly deed)
Never imagine you can choose a just
Or steady friend, or faithful in his trust.
But change your habits !
let them go their way Be condescending, affable, and gay !
Adopt with every man the style and tone
Most courteous and congenial with his own ;
But in your secret counsels keep aloof From feeble paltry souls ;
that, at the proof
Of danger or distress, are sure to fail;
For whose salvation nothing can avail.
Our state is pregnant;
shortly to produce 89-52 A rude avenger of prolong'd abuse.
The commons hitherto seem sober-minded, But their superiors are corrupt and blinded.
The rule of noble spirits, brave and high, Never endangered peace and harmony.
The supercilious, arrogant pretence
Of feeble minds;
weakness and insolence;
Justice and truth and law wrested aside
By crafty shifts of avarice and pride;
These are our ruin, Kurnus !—never dream (Tranquil and undisturbed as it may seem)
Of future peace or safety to the state;
Bloodshed and strife will follow soon or late.
Never imagine that a ruin'd land Will trust her destiny to your command, To be rcmodell'd by a single hand.
If expanded into its full dimensions, this passage would stand thus:
« The governments by an aristocracy of caste, such as ours, have never been overthrown while they have been directed by men of generous character, and resolute, magnanimous spirits;
the danger does not arise till they are succeeded by a poor-spirited, self­ ish generation, exercising the same arbitrary authority with mean and mercenary views.
"The following examples and warnings are adduced from tradi­ tional fable and later history.
Of the history of those governments we know nothing;
they were known to Theognis, probably by the poems of authors like himself;
one of whom (in a fragment accidentally preserved) speaks of his " fellow-citizens of Colophon as overbearing and oppressive from the time of their first settlement."
But the example of the Magnesians (whatever it may have been) seems to have presented to Theognis the most apposite parallel to the state of Megara;
ac­ cordingly, as an anxious and earnest adviser, regardless of repeti­ tion, he recurs to the conduct and fate of the Magnesian government, with a preface, too, almost in the same words as in fragm.
XIII.
Kurnus, our state is pregnant to produce 603-4
The avenger of oppression and abuse;
The birth (believe me) will not tarry long:
For the same course of outrage and of wrong
Which ruin'd the Magnesian state of old.
That very same we witness and behold.
In this state of things, the line of conduct which the poet pre­ scribed to himself is explained in the following lines.
with learnings nappy guts to celebrate, To civilize and dignify the state:
Not leaguing with the discontented crew, Nor with the proud and arbitrary few.
By an unavoidable consequence of his neutrality, he was (as it appears) blamed and abused on all sides, consoling himself, in the mean time, with the consciousness of his intellectual superiority.
That happy man, my friend, was never seen 367-70 Nor born into the world, whom saucy spleen Forbore to scandalize !
I know not, I, What they would have ;
but whether I comply To join with others in pursuit of ill, Or keep myself aloof,-they blame me still.
Such is my fortune ;
never understood, But censur'd by the wicked or the good.
My consolation still remains the same;
Fools cannot imitate the man they blame.
The following fragment is almost entirely a repetition from frag­ ments IX.
and XVIII.
That happy man, my friend !
that has through life 799-802 Pass'd unobnoxious to reproach or strife .... ....
Never existed yet;
nor ever will!
A task there is, which Jove could not fulfil, Infinite power and wisdom both combined Would not avail to satisfy mankind.
The sensibility to public opinion appears again strongly marked in the following fragment.
The generous and the brave, in common fame, 795-8 From time to time encounter praise or blame;
The vulgar pass unheeded;
none escape Scandal or insult in some form or shape.
Most fortunate are those, alive or dead, Of whom the least is thought, the least is said.
The apparent contradiction which is to be found in this passage exists also in the original.
That his understanding was under­ valued by the practical, busy persons of the time, may be inferred from the following lines.
The worldly minded and the worldly wise, 221-6
In ignorance and arrogance despise All talents and attainments but their own:
Wisdom is theirs, they think, and theirs alone.
But no !
the lessons of deceit and wrong, In point of fact, are neither hard nor long;
And many know them ;
-but a better will Prohibits some from practising their skill:
Some have a taste for good, and some for ill.
Of himself, in the mean time, as a practical politician, he speaks in substance rather disqualifyingly.
Many true counsels in this breast of mine 419-20 Lie buried;
many a just and fair design:
But inefficient, indolent, and weak, I know my nature, and forbear to speak.
The period of comparative happiness and tranquillity was now drawing to a close, and the poet, whose mind had hitherto been only occasionally saddened by the prospect of approaching evils, was doomed to witness a revolution, to be stript of his property, and some time after forced to abandon his native city, in company with his friend, and to commence a long course of exile and poverty.
The elements of a revolution, already in existence, were called into activity by the example of Athens, where the murder of Hip­ parchus had been followed, at the end of three years, by the ex­ pulsion of Hippias, upon which, after the ancient form of Athenian government had been again established for a short time, the weaker faction of the nobility, joining with the people, effected an abolition of the aristocracy of caste:
the very same which was in existence in Megara;
but whose existence was threatened (as has been seen in the preceding fragments) by its own misrule, and by the growing discontent of a more intelligent commonalty.
A re­ volution, therefore, at Megara was unavoidable;
and we shall see that it took place accordingly.
As a preface to the fragments which belong to this turbulent period, the following lines, referring to the assassination of Hip­ parchus, and the splendour of his funeral, may properly find their place.
The question of obedience or resistance to a sovereign de facto, as it was viewed in Greece, by a man of speculative and original mind, upwards of two thousand three hundred years ago, may be considered as a matter of curiosity.
Court not a tyrant's favour, nor combine 821-2
To further his iniquitous design;
But should he still misuse his lawless power, To trample on the people, and devour, Depose or overturn him;
any how I Your oath permits it, and the gods allow.
The two following fragments are also found separate;
but though relating to the same subject of a royal funeral, and appearing to be extracts from the same poem, they have not the same mark of continuity as the two preceding, and are therefore put separately.
I shall not join the funeral train, to go 1203-6
An idle follower in the pomp of woe:
For why-no duty binds me;
nor would he, Their arbitrary chief, have mourn'd for me.
I envy not these sumptuous obsequies, 1191-4
The stately car, the purple canopies;
Much better pleas'd am I, remaining here, With cheaper equipage and better cheer.
A couch of thorns, or an embroider'd bed, Are matters of indifference to the dead.
Two fragments are found (singularly enough) in immediate juxta-position with each other, and with one of the preceding.
The first of the two appears to be descriptive of the character of Hipparchus;
and the second to have been suggested by the sudden catastrophe which befell him.
Easy discourse with steady sense combined, 1185-6 Are rare endowments in a single mind.
No costly sacrifice nor offerings given 1187-90 Can change the purpose of the powers of heaven;
Whatever fate ordains, danger or hurt, Or death predestined, nothing can avert.
In the following fragment, the phrase o εἷς is evidently used in the same sense as its corresponding term, " The single person which was so frequently employed in England during the ten years from 1650 to 1660 to signify an individual exercising the functions of royalty.
The exact order of time and events in the short and confused period between the commencement of the changes which took place at Megara and the emigration or escape of Theognis and his friend, cannot be satisfactorily deduced from the fragments which exist.
It appears, however, that Theognis was at a very early period deprived of the greater part of his property ;
since two events are mentioned subsequent to his ruin and anterior to his flight from Megara.
The first is the arrival of his friend Clearistus, and of his old friend and instructor Simonides;
moreover, two seasons of the year are mentioned,-ploughing and harvest.
That the loss of his property was in some way or other the work of the opposite fac­ tion is clear, from the circumstance of his looking to the triumph of his own friends as the means of recovering it, and avenging himself upon those who had despoiled him of it, as he says, " with violence and outrage;
" but by what process, or under what pretence, this spoliation was effected, it is by no means easy to conjecture.
Kurnus in the mean time had held the first authority in the state ;
for his deposition from the highest office will be found dis­ tinctly alluded to in the verses occasioned by the visit of Simoni­ des above mentioned.
The same verses show that the state of things had become, in consequence, more desperate;
and it ap­ pears from another passage that, under these circumstances, Theognis himself had become the advocate of bold and violent measures, which, up to that time, he had deprecated.
Finally, the flight of the two friends from Megara was deter­ mined by the approach of an auxiliary force, despatched (probably from Corinth) as a reinforcement to their opponents.
These events must have succeeded to each other within a short period of time :
for when the Athenians invaded Eubœa, Theognis was already an exile.
Having now brought together the few fragments which illustrate the political condition of the- community to which he belonged, and the situation and sentiments of the poet himself, during the period anterior to the commencement of civil commotion,—it may be convenient to place under a single point of view other passages referrible to the same time, and illustrative of the character of the Mend to whom these and other poems were addressed;
and to whose person and fortunes (in spite of some occasional intervals of aversion and offence) he appears to have been most sincerely attached.
If popular distrust and hate prevail, 219-20 If saucy mutineers insult and rail, Fret not your eager spirit,-take a line Just, sober, and discreet, the same as mine.
The natural and undisguised arrogance of Kurnus is noted in the following lines, in which the sense of the original has been adhered to, though the expression has been unavoidably amplified.
My friend, the feeling you can not correct 1079-82 Will work at last a ruinous effect, To disappoint your hopes.
You cannot learn
To bear unpleasant things with unconcern ;
Nor work without repugnance or disgust
In tasks that ought to be performed, and must.
In the choice of his associates and adherents, the conduct of Kurnus seems to have been in contradiction with the advice of his friend.
We have seen in fragm.
XII.
that he warns him against placing any reliance on a particular class of persons, whom he there describes.
Admonitions to the same effect are repeated in other instances.
The kind of qualities which Theognis required in a friend may serve to give a notion of the violent character of the times, and of the critical condition of the party to which be belonged.
The two following fragments are nearly to the same effect.
Let no persuasive art tempt you to place 100-12 Your confidence in crafty minds and base;
-
How can it answer ?
Will their help avail
When danger presses, and your foes assail ?
The blessing which the gods in bounty send, Will they consent to share it with a friend ?
No !
—To oestrew the waves with scattered grain, To cultivate the surface of the main, Is not a task more absolutely vain Than cultivating such allies as these,- Fickle and unproductive as the seas.
Such are all baser minds, never at rest, With new demands importunately pressed, A new pretension or a new request;
Till, foil'd with a refusal of the last, They disavow their obligations past.
But brave and gallant hearts are cheaply gain'd, Faithful adherents, easily retained;
Men that will never disavow the debt
Of gratitude, or cancel or forget.
The civil person (he that, to your face 93-100 Professing friendship, in another place Talks in an alter'd tone) is not the man For a determined hearty partisan.
Give me the comrade eager to defend, And, in his absence, vindicate a friend;
Whose strong attachment will abide the brunt
Of bitter altercation, and confront Calumnious outrage with a fierce reproof:
Like brethren bred beneath a father's roof, Friends such as these may serve for your behoof —None others-Mark my words !
and let them be Fix'd as a token in your memory, For after-times, to make you think of me.
That nothing may be omitted, a fourth fragment on the same subject is subjoined.
Never engage with a poltroon or craven, 113-28 Avoid him.
Kurnus, as a treacherous haven.
Those friends and hearty comrades, as you think, (Ready to join you when you feast and drink,) Those easy friends, from difficulty shrink.
IFor a shrewd intellect, the best employ Is to detect a soul of base alloy ;
No task is harder, nor imports so much:
Silver or gold, you prove it by the touch;
You separate the pure, discard the dross, And disregard the labour and the loss ;
But a friend's heart,-base and adulterate, A friendly surface with a core of hate,- Of all the frauds with which the Fates have curst
Our simple easy nature, is the worst:
Beyond the rest, ruinous in effect,— And of all others hardest to detect.
For men's and women's hearts you cannot try Beforehand, like the cattle that you buy.
Nor human wit nor reason, when you treat For such a purchase, can escape deceit;
Fancy betrays us, and assists the cheat.
IIf these fragments were considered separately, we might imagine that Theognis was exciting his friend to some violent measure:
this was not the case;
he is only warning him (as we have already seen in the last lines of fragm.
XII.)
against placing a false confi­ dence in inefficient associates, and encumbering himself with the sort of burdensome and unprofitable dependency described in fragm XXXII.
The Athenian Alcibiades had been considered the hope and future support of the nobility to which he naturally belonged;
till an impatience of the superiority of older men, whose talents and services had placed them at the head of that party, led him to connect himself with the popular faction.
—Kurnus, either not meeting with the same obstacles to ascendency in his own party, or from whatever other reason, seems to have adhered to the cause of the aristocracy of Megara with perfect tenacity;
upholding and partaking in, their worst abuses;
-as may be inferred from the remonstrances of his friend.
Waste not your efforts, struggle not. my friend, 461-2(?)
Idle and old abuses to defend;
Take heed!
the very measures that you press May bring repentance with their own success.
We have seen in fragm.
XIII.
that iniquitous and partial de­ cisions formed one of the main grievances which endangered the public tranquillity;
and the following fragment expresses, though ess distinctly than in the original, that Kurnus himself was a principal in iniquities of this kind.
Kurnus, proceed like me !
Walk not awry !
331-2 Nor trample on the bounds of property !
The commission of some other offence, (an offence against the gods,) probably something in the nature of sacrilege or perjury, is obscurely, as if unwillingly, intimated, and attributed to the bad associates with whom he was engaged."
Bad company breeds mischief;
" Kurnus, you 1171-2 Can prove that ancient proverb to be true
In your own instance:
you yourself were driven To an unrighteous act;
offending Heaven !
Of the prudential and practical defects in Kurnus's character we have seen an instance in fragm.
XXX.;
the following is pro­ bably of a much earlier date;
it seems to be the sort of advice suited to a young man just entering the world, but marks a degree of rashness and irritability in the character to which such admoni­ tions were addressed.
At entertainments show yourself discreet:
309-12 Remember, that amongst the guests you meet
The absent have their friends ;
and may be told
Of rash or idle language which you hold.
Learn to endure a jest-you may display
Your courage elsewhere, in a better way.
The last line of the original is left untranslated;
it has no con­ nexion with the preceding, and seems to mark another chasm, which it would not be easy to supply.
The above have the ap­ pearance of being part of a series of maxims;
but a propensity to anger and intemperate language seems to be indicated in another fragment, apparently of later date than the former, though they are both probably earlier than any of the admonitory ones.
Rash angry words, and spoken out of season, 1221-2 When passion has usurped the throne of reason, Have ruin'd many.
-Passion is unjust,
And, for an idle transitory gust Of gratified revenge, dooms us to pay With long repentance at a later day.
A sort of Coriolanus-like insolence and contempt of the com.
monalty is marked in the following.
Never in anger with the meaner sort
Be mov'd to a contemptuous harsh retort, Deriding their distresses ;
nor despise
In hasty speech their wants and miseries.
Jove holds the balance, and the gods dispense
For all mankind riches and indigence.
Among the defects of Kurnus's character, one, not uncommonly incident to men of genius, but peculiarly unfortunate in a public man, seems to have been a morbid fastidiousness, producing a sort of premature misanthropy;
such, at least, is the inference de­ ductible from the following lines.
Observe, too, that the last lines of fragm.
X. refer to Kurnus's contemptuous estimate of his con­ temporaries.
A mixture of ingredients, good or bad, Such are we all, the best that can be had:
The best are found defective;
and the rest, For common use, are equal to the best.
Suppose it had been otherwise decreed-
How could the business of the world proceed ?
Fairly examined, truly understood, No man is wholly bad nor wholly good, Nor uniformly wise.
In every case, Habit and accident, and time and place, Affect us.
'Tis the nature of the race.
Theognis's admonitions and suggestions, in counteraction of this defect, are not very magnanimous ;
they resemble the concluding lines of fragm.
XI I.Join with the world;
adopt with every man 213-18 His party views, his temper, and his plan;
Strive to avoid offence, study to please, Like the sagacious inmate of the seas, That an accommodating colour brings, Conforming to the rock to which he clings;
With every change of place changing his hue;
The model for a statesman such as you.
The quarrels between Kurnus and his friend must be necessarily classed together;
though probably they range from the time of their first entrance into the world to the date of their expatriation.
That these quarrels took place in more instances than one seems evident from the different position in which Theognis is placed.
In one he intimates that he has been deceived, and his confidence abused;
in another he deprecates unrelenting resentment for a slight offence;
in another he speaks as a person unjustly calumniated;
another I should be inclined to assign to the time when Kurnus was at the head of affairs, and when Theognis's fortunes were ruined;
the others were probably anterior.
Let not a base calumnious pretence, 323-8 Exaggerating a minute offence, Move you to wrong a friend;
if, every time, Faults in a friend were treated as a crime, Here upon earth no friendship could have place.
But we, the creatures of a faulty race Amongst ourselves, offend and are forgiven:
Vengeance is the prerogative of Heaven.
The following must have arisen out of some other ground or difference;
though indirectly expressed, it is evidently intended to bear a personal application.
In the following, a feeling of coldness and distrust is marked on the part of the poet;
he is rejecting some proposal made to him by his friend, as tending to engage and compromise him.
That smith, dear Kurnus, shows but little wit, 539-4C
Who forges fetters his own feet to fit.
Excuse me, Kurnus!
I can not comply
Thus to be yok'd in harness-never try To bind me strictly, with too close a tie.
With respect to the next fragment there can be no doubt;
it is sufficiently decided, and angry enough.
No more with empty phrase and speeches fine 87-92 Seek to delude me, let your heart be mine:
Your friendship or your enmity declare
In a decided form, open and fair:
An enemy disguis'd, a friend in show, -I like him better, Kurnus, as a foe.
The next expresses a consciousness of innocence, and a defi­ ance of unjust calumny.
It is observable, that we find here the same singular association of ideas (water and gold) as in the first lines of Pindar.
Yes!
Drench me with invective!
not a stain 446 -52 From all that angry deluge will remain !
Fair harmless water, dripping from my skin, Will mark no foulness or defect within.
As the pure standard gold of ruddy hue, Prov'd by the touchstone, unalloyed and true ;
Unstained by rust, untarnished to the sight;
Such will you find me;
—solid, pure, and bright.
This image of the trial of gold seems from some reason or other to have been peculiarly familiar to the poet's mind.
It occurs in fragm.
VI. and XXXIV., and will be found again in verses com­ posed during his exile, fragm.
LXXVIII.
See the extraordinary work of Mr. Whiter on the association of ideas, considered as an instrument of criticism, and his application of it to the peculiar turns of transition observable in Shakspeare.
The two next relate apparently to minor differences;
in the first, the poet is out of humour at being in his turn advised and ad­ monished.
Change for the worse is sooner understood, 577-8 And sooner practised, than from bad to good.
Do not advise and school me !
good, my friend!
I'm past the time to learn-I cannot mend.
The next treats of that useless and interminable question, " Whose fault it was ?
"You blame me for an error not my own, 407-8 Dear friend!
the fault was yours, and yours alone.
The two following look more like a decided rupture than any of the foregoing;
they seem both to belong to the same time, and the tone is similar.
My mind is in a strange distracted state ;
1087-98 Love you I cannot !-and I cannot hate!
'Tis hard to change habitual goodwill, Hard to renounce our better thoughts for ill, To love without return is harder still.
Hut mark my resolution and protest!
Those services, for which you once profess'd
A sense of obligation due to me, On my part were gratuitous and free;
No task had I, no duty to fulfil;
No motive, but a kind and friendly will.
Now, like a liberated bird, I fly, That, having snapt the noose, ranges on high, Proud of his flight, and viewing in disdain
The broken fetter and the baffled swain, And his old haunt, the lowly marshy plain !
For you!
the secret interested end
Of him, your new pretended party friend, Whose instigation mov'd you to forego Your friendship, time will shortly show;
Time will unravel all the close design, And mark his merits, as compar'd with mine.
The second of these fragments has been injudiciously subdivided by Mr. Brunck;
but, whether perfect or not, it is evidently one and indivisible, the argument throughout being continuous.
The argument of the second fragment, if coarsely stated, would stand thus, " I have conferred upon you a celebrity similar to that which would have resulted to you from a victory at the Olympic Games.
Moreover, the celebrity which I have thus gratuitously conferred upon you, is much more lasting, more brilliant, and more extensive;
but instead of any suitable return for such a service, you are so destitute of those first blessings, common sense and common justice, that you treat me with neglect;
and when, like everybody else, I have an object which I am anxious to obtain, you disregard my application to you.
I am like one of those horses at the Olympic Games, which has acquired a celebrity for his master;
but, being ill treated, longs to escape.
"You soar aloft, and over land and wave 234-54 Are borne triumphant on the wings I gave (The swift and mighty wings, Music and Verse).
Your name in easy numbers smooth and terse
Is wafted o'er the world ;
and heard among
The banquetings and feasts, chaunted and sung, Heard and admir'd:
the modulated air Of flutes and voices of the young and fair Recite it, and to future times shall tell;
When, clos'd within the dark sepulchral cell, Your form shall moulder, and your empty ghost Wander along the dreary Stygian coast.
Yet shall your memory flourish fresh and young, Recorded and reviv'd on every tongue, In continents and islands, every place That owns the language of the Grecian race.
No purchased prowess of a racing steed, But the triumphant muse, with airy speed, Shall bear it wide and far, o'er land and main, A glorious and unperishable strain ;
A mighty prize, gratuitously won, Fix'd as the earth, immortal as the sun.
But for all this no kindness in return!
No token of attention or concern !
Baffled and scorned, you treat me like a child, From day to day, with empty words beguil'd.
Remember!
common justice, common sense, 255-8 Are the best blessings which the gods dispense:
And each man has his object;
all aspire To something which they covet and desire.
Like a fair courser, conqueror in the race, 257-60 Bound to a charioteer sordid and base, I feel it with disdain ;
and many a day Have long'd to break the curb and burst away.
We now come to the period of the poet's misfortunes, which may have been connected with a sea-voyage;
but which, we are told by him, were to be ascribed to the malice of his enemies, exerted per­ haps, as the following fragments may imply, by undue partiality in the law courts, and the crying grievance of judicial iniquity.
If from any other source we could obtain a knowledge of Theog­ nis's life and history, we might be able to account for some singu­ larities :
one of which (his familiarity with the language of the Assay Office) has been already pointed out, in the note to frag­ ment XLVII.;
but there is another, not a little remarkable, namely, his strong objections and remonstrance against the rule of Provi­ dence, by which the sins of the father were visited upon his de­ scendants !-Can we suppose that he is remonstrating with respect to his own case?
that, as we have seen in fragm.
XII., that judicial iniquity was the most crying grievance of the state, so (as was the case in Rome, after the death of Sylla) it might have been among the first remedied, and in a similar manner, namely, by transfer­ ring the judicature to another order of citizens:
a measure which might give rise to a course of equal partiality in an opposite direc.
tion.
Such a supposition would afford the best explanation of the state of alarm and confusion, short of actual violence, which filled the period antecedent to the poet's emigration.
Can we suppose, that while things were in this state, an old family law-suit (arising out of commercial matters, and unjustly decided in favour of his father or ancestor) had been revived under this new tribunal;
and that the sentence so ruinous to his fortune was at the same time so arbitrary and excessive, as to excite the resentment and eagerness for revenge, which he expresses elsewhere ?
The following lines (fragment LI I.) might seem to relate to some confidential deposit;
which perhaps, in expectation of an un­ favourable judicial decision, he would have set apart as a contin­ gent resource;
but which was either treacherously detained or sur­ rendered to his adversary.
Since writing the above, the following lines, which had not been noticed before, have appeared to bear a meaning referrible to the suppositions above stated.
They certainly have the appearance of a general maxim, assumed for the sake of a particular application, and are such as might well have been written by a person who conceived himself suffering under a retribution for the injustice of his predecessors;
and whose mind was occupied at the same time with the notion of providing some concealed resource, as a security against misfortune.
The association of ideas is so singular, that some such supposition seems necessary to account for it.
The result of his precaution appears as follows.
Bad faith hath ruin'd me;
distrust alone 829-34 Has sav'd a remnant;
all the rest is gone To ruin and the dogs !-
The powers divine, I murmur not against them, nor repine:
-Mere human violence, rapine, and stealth, Have brought me down to poverty, from wealth.
The following is a soliloquy, in which he is endeavouring to bring his mind into a more composed state.1023-30Learn patience, 0 my soul!
though rack'd and torn With deep distress-bear it !-it must be borne I Your unavailing hopes and vain regret, Forget them, or endeavour to forget:
Those womanish repinings, unrepress'd, (Which gratify your foes,) serve to molest Your sympathizing friends-learn to endure !
And bear calamities you cannot cure !
Nor hope to change the laws of destiny
By mortal efforts !-Vainly would you fly
To the remotest margin of the sky, Where ocean meets the firmament;
in vain Would you descend beneath, and dive amain Down to the dreary subterraneous reign.
The following lines, in a more composed and manly strain, seem to belong to the same period.
Entire and perfect happiness is never 1157-64 Vouchsafed to man ;
but nobler minds endeavour To keep their inward sorrows unreveal'd.
With meaner spirits nothing is conceal'd :
Weak, and unable to conform to fortune, With rude rejoicing or complaint importune, They vent their exultation or distress.
Whatever betides us, grief or happiness, The brave and wise will bear with steady mind, Th' allotment unforeseen and undefined
Of good or evil, which the gods bestow, Promiscuously dealt to man below.
What has been said a little while ago, of Theognis's remon­ strances against the rules of Providence, requires to be illustrated;
and the illustration may not improperly be placed here, as it is by no means improbable that the verses might have been composed about this time.
O mighty Jove !
I wish the powers of heaven 729-50 Would change their method !
that a rule were given Henceforward, for the wicked and profane, To check their high presumption, and restrain Their insolences and their cruelties ;
Who mock your ordinances, and despise Justice and right :
- henceforth should every man, In his own instance, justify the plan Of Providence ;
and suffer for his crime During his life;
or at the very time, With punishment inflicted on the spot:
For now, so long retarded or forgot, The retribution ultimately falls Wide of the mark-the vilest criminals Escape uninjured;
and the sad decree Affects their innocent posterity, (As oftentimes it happens,) worthy men Blameless and inoffensive-here again
The case is hard !
where a good citizen, A person of an honourable mind, Religiously devout, faithful and kind, Is doomed to pay the lamentable score Of guilt accumulated long before- Some wicked ancestor's unholy deed.
—I wish that it were otherwise decreed !
For now we witness wealth and power enjoy'd
By wicked doers;
and the good destroyed Quite undeservedly;
doomed to atone, In other times, for actions not their own.
The same notion of a posthumous hereditary retribution over­ taking the descendants of wicked men, appears in another frag­ ment, but without that tone of querulous expostulation which marks the preceding and other fragments.
Lawful and honest gain, the gift of Heaven, 197-208
Is lasting ;
and abides where it is given.
But where a man, by perjury or by wrong, Rises in riches ;
though secure and strong
In common estimation, (though he deem Himself a happy man, and so may seem,) Yet the just sentence on his wicked gains Already stands recorded, and remains For execution.-
Hence we judge amiss;
And the true cause of our mistake is this :
The punishment ordain'd by Heaven's decree Attaches to the sin, but (as we see In many cases) leaves the sinner free.- -Death follows, and is faster in his ra'e, While vengeance travels slowly;
speedy fate Arrests the offender at a shorter date.
The same tone of querulousness which was before noticed, and the same singular style of respectful but confident and familiar expostulation with the Deity, which the reader will have observed in a preceding fragment, is marked in another, which is placed here;
though, in the order of time, it should seem to be contempo­ rary with fragm.
LXXVIII.
and LXXIX.
Blessed, almighty Jove !
with deep amaze, 373-98 I view the world ;
-and marvel at thy ways !
All our devices, every subtle plan, Each secret act, and all the thoughts of man, Your boundless intellect can comprehend !
-On your award our destinies depend.
How can you reconcile it to your sense
Of right and wrong, thus loosely to dispense
Your bounties on the wicked and the good ?
How can your laws be known or understood ?
When we behold a man faithful and just, Humbly devout, true to his word and trust, Dejected and oppress d ;
-whilst the profane, And wicked, and unjust, in glory reign;
Proudly triumphant, flugh'd with power and gain ;
What inference can human reason draw ?
How can we guess the secret of thy law, Or choose the path approv'd by power divine ?
—We take, alas, perforce, the crooked line, And act unwillingly the baser part, Though loving truth and justice at our heart;
For very need, reluctantly compell'd To falsify the principles we held;
With party factions basely to comply;
To flatter, and dissemble, and to lie!
Yet lie- the truly brave-tried by the test
Of sharp misfortune, is approved the best:
While the soul-searching power of indigence Confounds the weak, and banishes pretence.
Fixt in an honourable purpose still, The brave preserve the same unconquer'd will, Indifferent to fortune, good or ill.
We struggle onward, ignorant and blind, For a result unknown and undesign'd, Avoiding seeming ills, misunderstood, Embracing evil as a seeming good ;
In our own plans, unable to detect Their final unavoidable effect.
Tormented with unsatisfied desire,
The fortunate to further aims aspire, Beyond the bounds of mortal happiness;
Restless and wretched in their own success !
We strive like children, and th' almighty plan Controls the froward, weak children of man IWe may now return from his metaphysical and moral specula­ tions, to a view of the poet's personal situation;
described in a few lines of welcome to a friend, connected with him by those relations of hospitality, which were most carefully maintained by the first families of Greece, as a resource against utter destitution in reverses of fortune.
—Clearistus, being ruined or distressed at home, comes by sea to Megara;
probably on a trading voyage;
but reckoning at the same time on the hospitality of the poet as his hereditary ally.
In a frail bark across the seas you come, 511-22 Poor Clearistus, to my poorer home !
Yet shall your needy vessel be supplied With what the gods in clemency provide :
And if a friend be with you, bring him hen, With a fair welcome to my simple cheer.
I am not yet a niggard, nor by stealth Dissemble the poor remnant of my wealth:
Still shall you find a hospitable board, And share in common what my means afford.
Then, should inquirers ask my present state, You may reply,-my ruin has been great:
Yet, with my means reduc'd, a ruin'd man, I live contented on an humbler plan ;
Unable now to welcome every guest;
But greeting gladly and freely, though distress'd, Hereditary friends, of all the best.
A natural incident brings back to his mind the recollection of his misfortunes;
this fragment concludes with the obscure line before-mentioned, relative to a sea-voyage.
W hen all is lost, and my paternal lands
Are till'd for other lords, with other hands:
Since that disastrous wretched voyage brought Riches and lands and everything to nought.
The following is an incident relative to another season of the year.
Theognis s passion for singing to the music of the pipe has been already noticed (fragm. II.);
the scene of this fragment is in the market-place of Megara, and the lines represent the poet's sudden exclamation, at a sight which puts an end to the amuse­ ment in which he was indulging.
The text is apparently muti­ lated, and (to the translator at least) hardly intelligible;
he has endeavoured, however, to restore the original picture from the traces which are still distinguishable.
How could I bear it ?
In the public place S23-3 To chaunt and revel!
when before my face, Seen in the distance, I discern the train Of harvest-triumph;
and the loaded wain And happy labourers with garlands crown'd, Returning from the hereditary ground, No more my own !
My faithful Scythian slave!
Break off this strain of idle mirth ;
and shave
Your flowing locks ;
and breathe another tone
Of sorrow for my fair possessions gone !
Independent of the unbecoming contrast between the levity of his amusements and the serious nature of his misfortunes, the re­ flection could not but occur to the mind of the poet, that he was now arrived at a time of life when the privileges and pretensions of early youth could no longer be pleaded in justification of similar frolics.
Elate with wine, my losses I despise, 1125-8
And rude attacks of railing enemies.
But youth departing, and remembered years
Of early mirth and joy, move me to tears;
While, in the dreary future, I behold The dark approach of age, cheerless and cold.
These lines may be reckoned as among the very last which were written at Megara, before his expatriation.
His feelings upon Simonides' arrival might be supposed to have been aggravated by the comparative change which had taken place in their circum­ stances ;
for at that time, to which we are now arrived, Theognis was ruined, and Simonides (whose attachment to the main chance was proverbial) was probably by this time a rich man;
for he ap­ pears to be giving an entertainment to which Theognis was invited.
It is not unlikely that this visit of Simonides (to Athens pro­ bably in the first place, but, as in former instances, extended to Megara) may be the same which is mentioned as having left a singular mark of meanness upon his character, when, revisiting Athens, after the expulsion of Hippias, he engaged to compose a panegyrical poem in honour of the assassins of his old friend and benefactor Hipparchus.
Arriving at Megara, the same man would undoubtedly pay his court to the faction then in power in that city;
but he could not omit sending an invitation to Theognis.
And what sort of invitation would such a man, under such circum­ stances, have contrived to send?
something, it may be supposed, to this effect-“
The company and conversation to be wholly literary &c. &c., " persons of distinguished talents, all anxious for an oppor­ tunity.” &c. &c., " a person so eminent for his genius and acquire­ ments.”
Now the lines of Theognis are (as we shall see) an answer, distinctly replying to and declining an invitation of this description.
"The sense of his own misfortunes and the dis­ tracted state of public affairs had rendered him unfit for company, and incapable of joining in any literary conversation
The answer to Simonides' “very obliging invitation" is as follows.
Simonides!
If with my learning's store 667-82 I still retained my riches as before, I should not shrink from joining as a guest
In converse with the wisest and the best.
But now, with idle shame opprest and weak, I sit dejected, and forbear to speak:
Feeble, forgetful, melancholy, slow, My former pride of learning I forego, My former knowledge I no longer know.
Such is our state !
in a tempestuous sea, With all the crew raging in mutiny!
No duty follow'd, none to reef a sail, To work the vessel, or to pump or bale ;
All is abandoned, and without a check
The mighty sea comes sweeping ofer the deck.
Our steersman, hitherto so bold and steady, Active and able, is deposed already.
No discipline, no sense of order felt;
The daily messes are unduly dealt.
The goods are plunder'd, those that ought to keep Strict watch are idly skulking or asleep ;
All that is left of order or command, Committed wholly to the basest hand.
In such a case, my friend!
I needs must think,
It were no marvel though the vessel sink.
This riddle to my worthy friends I tell, But a shrewd knave will understand it well.
This long simile of a ship is not original in Theognis;
it was to be found in an ode of Alcæus, an older poet, from whom Horace has copied it.
The last fragment has already anticipated the greater part of what can be learned from the few remaining fragments relative to the revolution ;
-the deposition of Kurnus;
—the low character of his successor;
-and the general confusion and disorder of the com- munit.
No lines can be found of which it can be decidedly said, that they relate to Kurnus's appointment to the highest authority of the state.
The following may have related to some earlier and inferior object of ambition.
Schemes unadvisable and out of reason 401-6 Are best adjourn'd-wait for a proper season!
Time and a fair conjuncture govern all.
Hasty ambition hurries to a fall;
A fall predestined and ordain'd by heaven:
By a judicial blindness madly driven, Mistaking and confounding good and evil, Men lose their senses, as they leave their level.
If the conjecture was right, which assigned the two fragments L. and LI.
to the period of Kurnus's elevation, they would account sufficiently for the non-appearance of any admonitory or political lines directly referring to it.
If again, (as is probable,) a recon­ ciliation took place after his deposition, the next lines may have been intended to obviate the influence of rash or treacherous ad­ visers upon a proud spirit recently mortified by the loss of power.
Stir not a step !
risk nothing !
but believe 283-92
That vows and oaths are snares, meant to deceive!
Jove is no warrant for a promise given, Not Jove himself, nor all the gods in heaven.
Nothing is safe;
no character secure, No conduct, the most innocent and pure:
All are corrupt, the commons and the great, Alike incapable to save the state.
The ruin of the noblest and the best Serves for an idle ballad or a jest.
Shame is abolish'd, and, in high command, Rage, Impudence, and Rapine rule the land.
It should seem that Kurnus was now disposed to follow the advice which his friend had before given him, respecting the choice of followers and adherents;
see fragm.
XXXII., XXXIII., XXXIV.
Theognis thinks such a party could not be formed of assured fidelity, and in sufficient force for the purposes which were in contemplation.
A trusty partisan, faithful and bold, 77-86 Is worth his weight in silver or in gold, For times of trouble.
-But the race is rare;
Steady determin'd men, ready to share Good or ill fortune!
—Such, if such there are, Could you survey the world, and search it round, And bring together all that could be found;
The largest company you could enroll, A single vessel could embark the whole !
-So few there are!
the noble manly minds Faithful and firm, the men that honour binds;
Impregnable to danger and to pain
And low seduction in the shape of gain.
The next fragment serves to mark more distinctly that Kurnus was no longer in office;
it is an ironical exhortation to his successor, the chief of the opposite party;
who, it should seem, was ruling away with a vengeance!
Lash your obedient rabble!
lash and load 845-48
The burden on their backs!
Spurn them and goad !
They '11 bear it all;
by patience and by birth, The most submissive, humble slaves on earth !
Another fragment seems to have been addressed to some person possessed at one time of influence, which he had misemployed ;
and whom the progress of the revolution had reduced to insignificance.
Friend!
if your sense and judgment had been wholly 453-6
Or nearly equal to your pride and folly, You might have seen yourself approved and priz'd, As much precisely as you 're now despis'd.
But the time was come when it was no longer safe to speak so openly,—the time, probably, of the visit of Simonides.
See the con­ cluding note subjoined to the verses addressed to him, fragm.
Scarce can I venture plainly to declare 813-13 Our present state, or what the dangers are.- -Let the worst happen!
I shall bear, I trust, Whatever fate determines-bear we must!
Inextricable difficulties rise, And death and danger are before our eyes.
We now find Theognis no longer averse to the desperate mea­ sures suited to a desperate situation-but still, as before, distrustful of the firmness and fidelity of the majority of the persons upon whom his friend relied.
From many a friend you must withhold your plans, 73-6 No man is safe with many partisans, No secret !- With a party, sure but small, Of bold adherents, trusty men withal, You may succeed:
else ruin must ensue, Inevitable, for your friends and you.
This advice seems to have been followed:
for we now come to a passage of singular interest-the speech of Theognis at a secret meeting of Kurnus's party friends.
The exordium and the.
con­ clusion of this speech are found in separate fragments;
but the character of each is clearly marked.
The exordium addresses Kurnus in the presence of his assembled partisans, on the necessity of efficacious remedies for the maladies of the state.
It is evi­ dently the prelude to a speech addressed to a council of con­ spirators ;
and the conclusion is marked by a conspirator's oath, (a very curious and remarkable one,) by which he binds himself to the assistance of his comrades, and to the execution of utter vengeance upon his enemies.
Some other fragments which are found separate, and which are not likely to have been composed at any other time by a man who had hitherto been averse to all violent and hazardous measures, are arranged in the only order which can be assigned to them.
Kurnus!
since here we meet friends and allies, 1129-80 We must consult in common to devise A speedy remedy with brief debate, To meet the new disorders of the state.
More practice is require and deeper skill, To cure a patient than to make him ill.
The wise, in easy times, will gladly rest;
When things are at the worst, a change is best.
* * * * * * * * *Kurnus! in power and honour, heretofore, 855-8 Your former fortunes you discreetly bore.
Fortune has altered !
bear it calmly still!
Endeavouring, with a firm and steady will, With other changes, our affairs to mend, With a bold effort, and with heaven to friend.
* * * * * * * *If Kurnus (our support) has been displac'd, 232-6 Our main defence dismantled and defac'd;
Must we, like cowards, of all hope forsaken, Lament and howl as if the town were taken ?
Though now reduced, no more a numerous host, 635-40 Courage and sense and honour are our boast.
Danger and hope are over-ruling powers
Of equal influence;
and both are ours.
Where counsel and deliberation fail, Action and strenuous effort may prevail.
******My spirit they shall never bend nor check, 1017-20 Though mountain-heaps were loaded on my neck:
Let feeble, coward souls crouch with affright, The brave are ever firm ;
firm and upright.
* * * * * *
*Then let the brazen fiery vault of heaven 867-70 Crush me with instant ruin, rent and riven, (The fear and horror of a former age,) If from the friends and comrades that engage
In common enterprise I shrink, or spare Myself or any soul!
If I forbear Full vengeance and requital on my foes!
All our antagonists!
all that oppose!
Whether this conspiracy succeeded to the extent of obtaining a temporary superiority within the town, or whether it was baffled by their opponents, or abandoned in despair by the party who projected it, we have no means of forming any conjecture:
in any one of these cases, the incident which appears next in order might equally have taken place.
The march of an armed force from some neighbouring state (whose politics were opposed to those of the party of Kurnus and Theognis) is indicated by a fire signal, and determines them to abandon their country and escape without delay.
A speechless messenger, the beacon's light, 549-56 Announces danger from the mountain's height!
Bridle your horses, and prepare to fly;
The final crisis of our fate is nigh.
A momentary pause, a narrow space, Detains them;
but the foes approach apace !
—We must abide what fortune has decreed, And hope that heaven will help us at our need.
Make your resolve!
at home your means are great;
557-60 Abroad you will retain a poor estate.
Unostentatious, indigent, and scant, Yet live secure, at least from utter want.
Whoever examines the political character of Corinth at this time, and remarks the evident bias of that government in favour of the democratic party at Athens, will feel no hesitation in con­ cluding that they must have been equally disposed to protect a party of similar principles in their own immediate neighbourhood;
and that the armed force above mentioned must have been de­ spatched from Corinth.
This conclusion will be confirmed by the next fragment.
Of the other two powerful neighbouring states, Thebes was of opposite politics, hostile in the extreme to the Athenian revolution, and (as we shall see afterwards) became a place of refuge for the Megarian exiles:
Athens, an Ionian state, would not at that period have presumed to interpose in the inter­ nal disputes of a Doric city;
and least of all at that particular crisis, when, with the whole weight of the Doric confederacy op­ posed to her, under the ascendency of Sparta, and directed by the ability and inveteracy of Cleomenes, she was reduced to the then unheard-of expedient of soliciting assistance from the king of Persia.
Placed in such a precarious situation, it would have been an act of madness on the part of the Athenians to have risked an offensive proceeding, which could have added nothing to their military security;
which would have disgusted Corinth ;
and which at any rate would have prevented the success of those intrigues, by which the Corinthians (themselves nominally and formally members of the confederacy) succeeded in disbanding the combined army.
at a time when it was already advanced into the plain of Eleusis, and on the eve of a battle, likely to have been the most bloodily decided of any that ever occurred in the internal wars of Greece.
Availing themselves of the dissolution of the main army, the Athenians lost no time in advancing against the Thebans and Chalcidians, who, in the meanwhile, had been making inroads upon the points bordering upon their own territory;
encountering them severally in rapid succession, they overthrew the Thebans, and immediately (the historian says on the same day) passing over into Eubœa, attacked and defeated the Chalcidians, seizing upon the territory and expelling the proprietors.
It should seem that Theognis, in escaping from Megara, had taken up his residence in Eubcea, where the politics of the leading party were congenial to his own.
Upon this occasion, then, he was a witness of the calamity which overwhelmed his friends and hos­ pitable partisans.-
The following lines are descriptive of what occurred.
Alas, for our disgrace!
Cerinthus lost!
887-90 The fair Lelantian plain !
a plundering host Invade it-all the brave banished or fled !
Within the town, lewd ruffians in their stead Rule it at random.
-Such is our disgrace !
May Jove confound the Cypselizing race!
The term of the "
Cypselizing race " could not possibly apply to any other people than the Corinthians;
but it may be a question, upon what grounds, and with what particular intention, the term is applied to them in this instance ?
Cypselus was entirely out of date;
and his son Periander, who succeeded him as tyrant of Corinth, had died after a long reign, in the last year of the 48th Olympiad (see Fasti Hellenici).
But Cypselus was the first un- derminer and destroyer of the Dorian aristocracy;
having sup­ planted the oligarchy of the Bacchiadæ, he had continued banish­ ing and destroying without intermission during the whole of his life;
and his son (after the usual interval of milder government in a new reign) had resumed his father's policy, and pushed it to a more severe extreme.
Cypselus was a tyrant and a usurper, but the system of which he was the personification was persevered in after his death.
The principle upon which his usurpation had been founded (a hatred of the hereditary oligarchies) still continued to influence the policy of Corinth, and manifested itself in their support of the democratic revolution of Athens and Megara.
This was the point which Theognis (doubly a sufferer from the effects of this policy) meant to mark;
and if this view of the subject is admissible, his intention in characterizing the Corinthians as a Cypselizing race may be capable of explanation.
Expelled from Eubœa, Theognis seems to have retired to Thebes, a state whose politics were congenial to his own;
fellow-sufferers also, like his friends in Eubcea, from the unexpected vigour of the Athenians, who up to that time, when they became animated (as Herodotus observes) by the new excitement of liberty, had never been accounted very formidable antagonists ;
while the Thebans, considering themselves, as they were, a superior race of men, dis­ tinguished by a peculiar system of tactics and singular personal prowess in the field, upon which the success of their tactical sys­ tem depended, were wholly unable to digest the disgrace of a de­ feat.
It should seem, both from local situation and the temper and spirit of the people, that Thebes must have been the scene of those projects and hopes which Theognis and his friends at one time entertained, of recovering possession of their native city, either by force or stratagem, and executing a severe vengeance upon their opponents.
It so happened, that in the house of a Theban nobleman a fa­ vourite facetious female slave, Argyris by name, was admitted to enliven the party.
The music of the pipes was introduced after dinner;
this was a temptation which Theognis could not resist, and which overset all the σεμνοτης (grave good breeding) befitting his condition as an exiled noble.
He offered to accompany the music, and performed so well as to excite general admiration and applause;
and probably, at the same time, to lower himself to a certain degree in the estimation of the company;
which Argyris perceiving joined in the general expression of admiration,—“ It was very extraordinary—very extraordinary indeed-the gentleman must have had a great deal of practice-he must have practised very young-perhaps his mother might have been a flute-player," to which we may suppose the poet to have answered, " No!
that his acquirements were not so limited;
that, like all other persons of tolerable education in Megara, he had also learned to accom­ pany himself upon the lyre;
" thereupon, the lyre being handed to lim, he sung to it some extempore verses;
acknowledging that passion for accompanying the music of the pipe, which had sub­ jected him to so severe an insinuation;
replying to it at the same time by an assertion of the nobility of his birth, and a severe re­ taliation upon the condition and origin of the person who had of­ fended him.
These lines, originally produced extempore, formed a short poem, of which the lines already given in illustration of his early pursuits (and which are here repeated, in what appears to be their proper place) would have been the conclusion, at least as far as regarded the affront received, and the person who had offered it.
My heart exults, the lively call obeying, 531-4
When the shrill merry pipes are sweetly playing;
With these to chaunt aloud or to recite, To carol and carouse, is my delight:
Or in a stedfast tone, bolder and higher, To temper with a touch the manly lyre.
*****The slavish visage never is erect;
535-8
But looks oblique and language indirect Betray their origin-no lovely rose, Or hyacinth, from the rude bramble grows;
Nor from a slavish and degraded breed Can gentle words or courteous acts proceed.
*****From noble Æthon my descent I trace, 1209-16 Thebes grants me refuge and a resting-place;
Forbear then, Argyris, with empty mirth, Yourself a slave, to scandalize my birth:
Woman !
I tell thee, wandering and forlorn, In exile and distress, much have I borne, Sorrows and wrongs and evils manifold;
But to be purchased as a slave and sold Has never been my fate, and never will:
And I retain a town and country still, Along the banks of the Lethæan river, In a fair land, where I shall live for ever.
For a firm friend, a steady partisan, A faithful and an honourable man, Disdaining every sordid act, and mean, No slave am I, nor slavish have I been.
At no great distance from two of the preceding, a fragment is found, separated into two in Brunck's edition;
but which, though two or more intermediate lines may possibly be wanting, appear connected by the particle δὲ and by the infinitive form of the verb, which runs through both.
These lines belong clearly to the same period as the preceding, when he was hospitably entertained at Thebes, and while he still cherished hopes of a triumphant return to Megara.
Now, if we figure to ourselves the preceding scene, and do not suppose Theognis to be utterly destitute of civility and common sense, we may fairly take it for granted that the extem­ pore effusion, in which he retaliated the offence given by the slave, would not have terminated without some marked expression of respect and deference to the master of the house;
who was wholly guiltless of the offence which had been given him.
In the trans­ lation which follows, the fragment last mentioned is understood and interpreted in this sense.
To seize my lost possessions and bestow 561-6 Among my friends the spoils of many a foe, Such is my trust and hope;
meanwhile I rest Content and cheerful an admitted guest, Conversing with a wise and worthy mind, Profound in learning, and in taste refin'd.
Watching his words and thoughts to bear away Improvement and instruction, day by day.
The hopes and projects of an exile, briefly alluded to in the pre­ ceding fragment, are more distinctly marked in a passage alluding to the story of Ulysses;
he anticipates like him a safe return from hell (in his own case, the hell of banishment) and a similar tri­ umphant reestablishment in his native country;
with an equally full revenge upon his antagonists, and a joyful meeting with his Penelope and his Telemachus, his wife and son ;
whom it should seem that he had left behind.
The same allusion to his state of banishment as a kind of hell will be found in another passage, (composed long after, under the influence of very different views and expectations,) where the example which he takes as a parallel to his own is that of Sisyphus.
Talk not of evils past!
Ulysses bore 1119-24 Severer hardships than my own, and more;
Doom'd to descend to Pluto's dreary reign,- Yet he returned, and viewed his home again, And wreak'd his vengeance on the plundering crew, The factious haughty suitors, whom he slew:
Whilst all the while, with steady faith unfeigned, The prudent, chaste Penelope remained, With her fair son ;
waiting a future hour, For his arrival and return to power.
The above allusion to the good conduct of his wife is confirmed by lines addressed to Kurnus;
who, it should seem, was equally fortunate.
Kurnus, of all good things in human life, 1223-24 Nothing can equal goodness in a wife..
In our own case we prove the proverb true;
You vouch for me, my friend, and I for you.
A mixture of hope and despondency accompanied by a vehement passion for revenge are marked in the following lines.
It must be observed, however, that in the concluding lines a proverb con­ tracted from a simile is expanded into the simile from which it originated, no equivalent proverb being found in the English lan­ guage.
The word χαράδρα in the original may perhaps have been in­ tended to convey a local meaning:
it signified a gully, the bed of a wintry torrent-a ravine of this kind called the Charadra was one of the boundaries of the Megarian territory.
Theognis, therefore, may have meant to allude to the direction in which he had passed the frontier.
May Jove assist me to discharge the debt 337-50 Of kindness to my friends, and grant me yet A further boon-revenge upon my foes!
With these accomplished, I could gladly close My term of life-a fair requital made ;
My friends rewarded, and my wrongs repaid, Gratitude and revenge, before I die, Might make me deern'd almost a deity !
Yet hear, 0 mighty Jove, and grant my prayer, Relieve me from affliction and despair!
O take my life, or grant me some redress, Some foretaste of returning happiness !
Such is my state—I cannot yet descry A chance of vengeance on mine enemy, The rude despoilers of my property.
Whilst I, like to a scar'd and hunted hound, That scarce escaping, trembling and half drown'd, Crosses a gully swelled with wintry rain, Have crept ashore, in feebleness and pain.
Yet my full wish-to drink their very blood-
Some power divine, that watches for my good, May yet accomplish.
-Soon may he fulfil
My righteous hope, my just and hearty will.
The pleasures of hope (the proverbial consolation of a banished man) are the subject of the next fragment.
For human nature Hope remains alone 1131-46 Of all the deities-the rest are flown.
Faith is departed ;
Truth and Honour dead ;
And all the Graces too, my friend, are fled.
The scanty specimens of living worth, Dwindled to nothing, and extinct on earth.
Yet, whilst I live and view the light of heaven, (Since Hope remains, and never has been driven From the distracted world,) the single scope Of my devotion is to worship Hope:
When hecatombs are slain, and altars burn, With all the deities ador'd in turn, Let Hope be present;
and with Hope, my friend, Let every sacrifice commence and end.
Yes !
insolence, injustice, every crime, Rapine and wrong, may prosper for a time;
Yet shall they travel on to swift decay
That tread the crooked path and hollow way.
The fourth line is characteristic;
the victim of a popular revolu­ tion lamenting that democracy had destroyed the Graces ;
like the Commandeur in that admirable Proverbe of Monsr.
Le Clercq's— Les Soupers.
It should seem that the hopes entertained by the poet and the emigrant party to which he belonged, were never realized;
and that (as was naturally to be expected) a spirit of impatience and discontent must have begun to be prevalent amongst them.
The following lines seem to belong to this period, and to be descriptive of the altered temper of his associates in misfortune.
I search among my friends—none can I find, 415-18 No sterling, unadulterated mind;
None that abides the crucible like mine;
Rising above the standard—superfine!
In these lines the sense which is assigned to the word ὑπερτερίη, " above the standard," is assumed from the context:
the lexicons do not give it, nor is it to be expected that lexicographers should find in ancient authors the technical terms of the assay office;
but we have seen already that it was an object familiar to the mind of the poet.
Theognis, it should seem, must have been among the poorest of the party,—having escaped from Megara πάντ' ἀποσεισάμενος, " stript of everything," a circumstance necessarily omitted in the translation of fragm.
LXXVIII., as it would have appeared some­ what absurd if combined with the simile of the dog.
The follow­ ing lines seem to have been occasioned by the illiberality of some of his companions who were less destitute than himself.
An exile has no friends!
no partisan 209-10
Is firm or faithful to the banish'd man;
A disappointment and a punishment, Harder to bear, and worse than banishment!
The reader is here requested to turn back to the fragment marked LVII., beginning " Blessed Almighty Jove;
" (which from the singularity of its tone had been placed in juxtaposition with others of a like character;
) he will probably be of opinion that in chronological order it ought to stand here, as it marks a time when the notion of abandoning his party, and endeavouring to con­ ciliate the victorious faction, (though not admitted or approved,) has distinctly presented itself to his mind.
The next fragment marks his resolution upon this subject as al­ ready taken.
In consequence of the neglect of his associates, he declares his intention of negotiating for himself, and endeavouring to conciliate the faction by which he had been expelled.
The last and worst of ills, save death alone ! 809-12 The worst of human miseries is my own !
-Those friends of mine have cast me off, and I Must seek perforce a last resource, to try To treat and tamper with the enemy.
}The English reader is desired to interpret the words " cast me off" as an expression, indirectly implying a refusal of pecuniary assistance;
the word in the original (προυδώκαν) is used in this sense in another passage of the poet, (not here translated, in which a poor courtesan is describing her own condition, ver. 859.
The same tone of complete despondency, the same complaint of abandonment on the part of his friends, and the consequent neces­ sity of endeavouring to conciliate his enemies, are apparent in the following fragment.
Happy the man, with worldly wealth and ease, 1007-10 Who, dying in good time, departs in peace.
Nor yet reduced to wander as a stranger
In exile and distress and daily danger;
To fawn upon his foes, to risk the trial Of a friend's faith, and suffer a denial!
A short fragment is to be found, of little merit in itself;
but which (as it evidently marks a particular turn in the views and feelings of the poet) cannot, according to the strict rules of criti­ cism, be overlooked, in any attempt to ascertain and arrange the incidents of his life.
The original of this singular and perplexing passage, if expanded into the dimension which is necessary to ren­ der its intention and meaning discernible to an English reader, might stand thus:
No mean or coward heart will I commend 1077-78 In an old comrade or a party friend :
Nor with ungenerous, hasty zeal decry A noble-minded gallant enemy.
The original couplet (for it is a couplet in the original) appears, like others of the detached couplets, which are found in our pre­ sent copies, to have been the exordium of a separate poem;
a poem of which, as of many others, only the initial lines have been pre­ served.
In this poem (as is apparent from the supposed intro­ ductory lines) the poet's intention must have been to pass in re­ view the characters of his own partisans, and also those of his adversaries, with professed impartiality, but with a candid bias in favour of his opponents.
It was clearly not written before his banishment from Megara, nor when, many years after, he had gained permission to return thither;
but it appears to be the preface to an oration made by ow poet to the dominant party at Megara.
It is clear from fragms.
LXXXIII. and LXXXIV. that Theog­ nis must have been in negotiation, or at least attempting to nego­ tiate, with the party in possession of the city,-the party by whom he had been expelled.
With a view, then, to conciliate his adver­ saries, and to prepare the way for his own recall, what method would be most likely to be employed by a man who was in the habit of employing poetry upon all occasions;
who replies in verse to the impertinence of a female slave;
and whom we have seen composing in metre the speech which he delivered at a party meet­ ing, assembled at a critical time, and deliberating upon the adop­ tion of the most dangerous measures ?
There should seem to be little difficulty in supposing that the habitual and natural language of the poet must have been employed upon this occasion;
that verse would have been the vehicle of his first overtures;
and that a poem of affected candour, in which, as he says himself, his friends (the bad ones at least) were not to be praised, and his enemies (the good ones at least) were not to be blamed, must have been the first overture to the treaty which he was endeavouring to open with the victorious party.
The failure of this negotiation will in the mean while serve to account for the tone of utter dejection and despondency which is marked in the next fragment.
Not to be born-never to see the sun— 425-28 No worldly blessing is a greater one !
And the next best is speedily to die, And lapt beneath a load of earth to lie !
We are now approaching to a very different period of the poet's existence-his long residence in Sicily.
That island and the coun­ try of Magna Græcia, as it was called, (the maritime portion of the continental territory of Naples,) stood at that time in the same re­ lation to the older states of Greece as the coasts of Asia Minor had done at an early period:
nearly the same as that of the States of America with respect to the present European world.
The western colonies of the little world of Greece were the common re­ fuge of unemployed talent.
Abounding in wealth to a degree that was become proverbial, and profuse in their encouragement of all the arts by which their customary forms of life could be polished or adorned, they afforded an asylum and the means of employ­ ment and maintenance to talents and ingenuity of every kind.
Among the many persons who sought refuge in this new world, there could have been hardly any one who was determined to such a measure, by circumstances of more complete destitution than those in which Theognis must have found himself.
This resolu­ tion is announced in the following lines;
the last, as it should seem, in which the name of Kurnus occurs.
In the original, there is a point of character and feeling, which is imperfectly represented in the translation.
-In taking leave of his friend, he repeats his name several times.
For noble minds, the worst of miseries, 173-82 Worse than old age or wearisome disease, Is poverty-from poverty to flee, From some tall precipice prone to the sea
It were a fair escape to leap below !
In poverty, dear Kurnus !
we forego Freedom in word and deed-body and mind, Action and thought, are fetter'd and confined.
Let me then fly, dear Kurnus, once again !
Wide as the limits of the land and main, From these entanglements ;
with these in view, Death is the lighter evil of the two.
We now come to the period of his long residence in Sicilv, where the following lines were composed under the pressure of dis­ tress and difficulty;
probably soon after his arrival, and while the impressions of a sea-voyage were uppermost in his mind.
Wearied and sick at heart, in seas of trouble, 619-20 I work against the wind, and strive to double
The dark disastrous cape of poverty.
The following lines seem to have been composed about the same time and under the same circumstances;
it is curious that the habit of generalization should follow him, even when reflecting upon his own situation;
his mind expands itself naturally into a comprehensive observation.
His personal talents and acquirements seem at this time to have been his sole resource;
amongst them, the proficiency which he had attained to as a vocal performer, accompanying the music of the pipe.
In this character we find him assisting at a musical festival, and apologizing for his voice, which is likely, he says, to be affected by having accompanied a party of revellers and serenaders the night before;
moreover the other performer, who ought to have borne a part with him, has failed in his engagement.
But he has no ob­ jection to the piper whom they have provided, and will proceed with his engagement.
"I cannot warble like a nightingale;
933-8
This voice of mine, I fear, is like to fail, With rambling on a revel late at night.
I shall not make a poor excuse, to slight Your piper's art and practice;
but the friend
That ought to bear his part here, and attend, In fact is absent.
I must do my best;
And put my talent fairly to the test.
So, praying to the gods for help and grace, Close to the pipers side I take my place.
In the original there is an ambiguity which could not be repre­ sented in English ;
in one sense implies his skill as a mu­ sician;
in the other it describes his position at the side of the piper.
Exhibitions such as this must have been felt as mortifying by a man of birth, and one who had been originally a person of rank and consequence in his native city;
accordingly, we find feelings such as might be expected from him expressed in the following frag­ ment, written probably about the same time.
O poverty!
how sorely do you press, 649-52 Debasing soul and body with distress:
To such degrading offices you bind A manly form, an elevated mind, Once elegantly fashion'd and refin'd.
!
It is but too natural to suppose, that the attempts of a poor gen­ tleman to obtain a living by the exercise of talents, which had formerly served for his amusement, would be exposed to the cen­ sure of professional performers;
one of them, it should seem, (Aca­ demus by name,) had spoken of him as not being a thorough-bred musician, but a kind of mule between an artist and amateur.
To this taunt he replies in the first of the two following fragments:
the second, though separated in the present text, seems to belong to it, as an easy conciliatory conclusion to the previous reprimand.
For a full proof, betwixt myself and you, Which is the better minstrel of the two.
Then would I show you that a mule surpasses
In his performance all the breed of asses.
* * * * * * *Enough of such discourse ;
now let us try 1051-4 To join our best endeavours, you and I, With voice and music;
since the Muse has bless'd
Us both with her endowments ;
and possessed With the fair science of harmonious sound
The neighbouring people, and the cities round.
The last lines mark his position as a foreign artist;
he is com­ plimenting the natives.
We now find that he was beginning to get together a little money;
and the next fragment will show that he was become very careful of it.
Being now under the necessity of vindicating himself from a charge of meanness and parsimony, his defence is made in the same spirit of generalization which has been already noticed as a peculiar feature of his mind.
Though gifted with a shrewd and subtle ken, 1055-8 Timagoras!
the secret hearts of men (You'll find it) are a point hard to be guess'd;
For poor and shabby souls in riches dress'd, Make a fair show ;
while indigence and care
Give to the noble mind a meaner air.
Theognis might have been enabled to maintain himself at first, and possibly to make a little money, in the way above described;
and perhaps by teaching music and poetry;
but his most import­ ant occupation, (like that of his instructor Simonides,) and that from which the chief source of his gains would have arisen, was the direction of the choral entertainments, which were exhibited in competition by the different tribes, at the expense of the wealth­ iest citizens of each, who were called choregi.
Theognis on one occasion seems to have met with one of these who was insensible to the advantages of some proposed improvement;
and he is led to the conclusion expressed in the following verses-that the rarity of the union of wealth and good taste in the same individual is highly unfavourable to the progress of the fine arts!
Dunces are often rich, while indigence 683-6 Thwarts the designs of elegance and sense.
Nor wealth alone, nor judgment can avail;
In either case art and improvement fail.
Finding himself become an active person, the reflection seems to have occurred to him that he had formerly been equally active in pursuits of a very different kind.
This reflection, according to his usual habit, is generalized in the following lines.
On various errands, various as their hue, A fluttering, eager, ever busy crew.
As his circumstances improved his spirits seem to have risen, and he rejoices in the success of his exertions, though conscious of their derogatory character.
Plutus! of all the gods the first and best, 1113-14 My wrongs with your assistance are redrest;
Now, reinstated in respectability, In spite of all my baseness and humility.
Though now relieved from poverty, he was unable, or did not deem it advisable, to indulge his wishes and fancies, as he had been in the habit of doing formerly.
This change seemed to re­ quire an apology, which he addressed to them, as follows.
My old companions, Fancy and Desire! 695-6 To treat you both, as each of you require, My means are insufficient—never mind !
Ours is the common case of human-kind.
At length he finds himself in a situation in which he is led to consider the question of greater indulgence and a larger expendi­ ture.
This question, after viewing it on both sides, he seems dis­ posed to determine in favour of continued economy.
The perplexity of which Theognis complains is one which in our times would be easily solved by sinking a portion of capital or the whole of it in a life-annuity:
but he was fearful of infringing upon his capital, apprehending that he might live more than long enough to consume the whole.
Could we beforehand ascertain the date
Of our existence, we might fix a rate For our expense, and make it more or less;
But as it is, we must proceed by guess.
The road divides !
which path am I to choose ?
Perplex'd with opposite diverging views.
Say, shall I struggle on, to save and spare, Or lead an easy life and banish care ?
Some have I seen, with competence of wealth, Indifferent to friendship, pleasure, health, Struggling and saving;
till the final call, Death sends his summons, and confiscates all!
Allotting to the thankless, heedless heir
The produce of his economic care IYet others have I seen reckless of pelf;
" I take my pastime, and I please myself,"— Such was the jolly phrase ;
the same gallant Have I beheld an utter mendicant;
In sad dependence, at his latter end, Watching and importuning every friend.
Our wiser course then, Damocles, I deem, Is that which steers aloof from each extreme:
Not to consume my life with care and pain, Economizing for another's gain ;
And, least of all, to risk the future fears
Of indigence in my declining years.
With this reflection, therefore, I incline 927 -8 To lean a little to the saving line:
For something should be left when life is fled To purchase decent duty to the dead;
Those easy tears, the customary debt
Of kindly recollection and regret.
Besides, the saving of superfluous cost
Is a sure profit, never wholly lost;
Not altogether lost, though left behind, Bequeathed in kindness to a friendly mind.
The just approval of the good and wise, Public applauses, friendly courtesies ;
Where all combine a single name to grace With honour and preëeminence of place, Coevals, elders, and the rising race !
This last passage is separated from the preceding in Brunck's edition.
It is possible that some intermediate lines may have been lost, but the train of thought seems to be continuous:
he feels that the estimation which he has acquired in society is such as to supersede any temptation to increase it, by living at an increased expense.
It is difficult to assign a place to the following fragment;
that it was written in exile is evident.
It is placed here rather for the sake of marking the time of the battle of Elorus, than in any confidence that it actually related to it—The tone of carelessness and indifference in which he speaks of going to battle, as upon a mere point of honour, forbids us to assign this fragment to the time of the action between the Chat- cidians and Athenians, in which he must have felt a strong in­ terest.
Peace is my wish, may peace and plenty crown 881-6
This happy land, the people and the town !
May peace remain !
and may we never miss
Good cheer and merry meetings such as this!
Whether at home or here, all wars I hate, All battle I detest and execrate.
Then never hurry forward !
for we fight
Not for ourselves nor for our country's right.
But with the bawling herald, loud and clear, Shouting a noisy summons in my ear, And with my own good horse, for very shame, We must engage and join the bloody game.
The battle of Elorus, in which the Syracusans were totally de­ feated, was followed by the siege of Syracuse;
which appears to have been long protracted, since it afforded time for a singular combination-that of the Corinthians and Corcyreans, habitually enemies, but each of them interested in behalf of the Syracusans as a kindred race.
The joint assistance and interposition of these two states effected the deliverance of the Syracusans, under a com­ promise, by which they surrendered to Gelo the sovereignty of Camarina.
Suidas says that during the siege Theognis wrote a poem to " those who had escaped," meaning, probably, those who, having escaped from the battle, were afterwards the defenders of the besieged town.
The gods have granted mighty stores of pelf 863-6
To many a sluggard, useless to himself
And his own partisans :
but high renown Awaits the warrior who defends the town.
The events above-mentioned seem to have led to Theognis' re­ turn from his long exile.
The state of Corinth was democratic.
The Corinthians had promoted the revolution at Megara and fa­ voured that of Athens;
they were " the Cypselizing race " whom Theognis had execrated as the authors of his misfortunes and dis­ appointments.
The Corinthian deputies and commanders, how­ ever, on their arrival at Syracuse, must have found their old aristo­ cratic victim transformed by circumstances into a very passable democrat, engaged in the defence of the city against a besieging force, commanded by the patron of the exiled aristocracy.
Theog­ nis having no doubt introduced himself to the acquaintance of the Corinthian commander, (an influential person in a state which possessed a great ascendency over Megara,) conscious moreover of a literary reputation which would do honour to his country, and sufficiently provided with certificates of civism, seems to have thought that nothing more was wanting to procure his erasure from the "List of Emigrants:
" his Corinthian friend, however, whose political sagacity seems to have suggested the story of Sisyphus and Proserpine, was unable to extricate him from the " Hell of Banishment" upon the simple consideration of his late political conduct.
Drachmas, it should seem, he had accumu­ lated, and a certain sacrifice of drachmas was necessary to the suc­ cess of the negotiation.
Under these circumstances the following characteristic lines were produced.
The story of Sisyphus and Proserpine appears, at first sight, not only foreign to the main subject and purpose, (an expression of devout gratitude to the god of wealth,) but is moreover unaccount­ ably tedious;
this very tediousness, however, is an artifice of the poet, by which he directs the attention of the reader to a meaning which he could not venture more distinctly to express.
O Plutus !
justly to your gifts and you 523-6 Mankind attribute praise and honour due.
With your assistance we securely face Defeat and disappointment and disgrace.
Thus to reward the virtuous, and to slight Wicked and dirty knaves, is surely right!
For with the world at large no merit tells, 697-718 But Plutus and his bounty,-nothing else!
No !
not the sense of Rhadamanthus old, Nor all the shrewd devices manifold, Which Sisyphus, the keen Corinthian, knew;
That wily chief, that, if old tales are true, Made a most strange escape, so poets tell, By dint of rhetoric, he returned from hell!
For she, (that kind oblivion can dispense, But takes away the judgment and the sense,)
The goddess Proserpine, by strong persuasion, Consented to connive at his evasion:
A thing unheard of and unknown before ;
That, having passed the dark infernal door, And visited those dreary realms below, From that disastrous prison-house of woe, A man by policy should work his way, Emerging into light and upper day!
Sisyphus gained a point which none beside (Of all that ever liv'd or ever died)
Could have achiev'd—yet Sisyphus would fail, Nor would Ulysses with his arts prevail, Nor aged Nestor with his eloquence-
No merit would avail you—no pretence;
Though you possessed the vigour and the speed
Of the swift Harries, or the winged breed Of Boreas, in the proud Olympic game A conqueror;
your native place and name Recorded and announced with loud acclaim;
}
Still would you find the common saying hold, " Fame is a jest;
favour is bought and sold;
No power on earth is like the power of gold."
}Whether the preceding lines were composed at Syracuse, or afterwards in Greece, (Lacedæmon,) where, it should seem, he waited the result of his negotiation, cannot be determined.-
They are placed here as forming a natural sequel to the fragments re­ ferrible to Syracuse, and as an introduction to those which from their internal marks must be assigned to Lacedæmon.
The first of these bear a strong indication of having been composed at the time when the poet had passed the meridian of life.
The " black fear of death which saddens all" is strongly marked in the first lines.
Enjoy your time, my soul!
another race 1067-8 Will shortly fill the world, and take your place;
With their own hopes and fears, sorrow and mirth:
I shall be dust the while, and crumbled earth.
But think not of it!
Drink the racy wine 875-80 Of rich Taygetus, pressed from the vine Which Theotimus, in the sunny glen, (Old Theotimus, lov'd by gods and men,) Planted, and watered from a plenteous source, Teaching the wayward stream a better course.
Drink it, and cheer your heart, and banish care;
A load of wine will lighten our despair.
I should be inclined to think that Theognis must have been connected by the ties of hospitality with some Spartan or Laco­ nian families;
that of Theotimus, for instance, here mentioned, or that Clearistus (before mentioned as so connected with him) may have been a Laconian.
The following lines appear also to have been written in Lacedæ­ mon, and evidently relate to some matter of important trust—pro­ bably to the friendly and confidential agency through which he was enabled to purchase a remission of his exile.
The next lines, though referrible to Lacedæmon, may have been composed there at an earlier period of the poet's life.
Though in both instances the conclusion points to hard drinking, they seem much too juvenile for the author of fragm.
CI I.
The four con­ cluding verses have been subjoined as a natural sequel.
In the original they are separated, and stand as a distinct fragment in Brunck's edition.
Now that in mid-career, checking his course, 991-6
The bright sun pauses in his pride and force,- Let us prepare to dine, and eat and drink
The best of everything that heart can think ;
And let the shapely Spartan damsel fair Bring, with a rounded arm and graceful air, Water to wash, and garlands for our hair.
In spite of all the systems and the rules 1035-6 Invented and observed by sickly fools-
Let us be brave, and resolutely drink, Not minding if the dog-star rise or sink.
The two first lines of the original are hardly intelligible.
It seems probable that two lines may have been lost between the first and the second.
The next fragments bring us back to Megara, and represent Theognis as a returned emigrant, studiously and anxiously patri­ otic and popular, giving an indirect pledge in the first fragment, and a more decided one in the second, of his resolution to abstain from party politics, and to confine himself to the cultivation of poetry and of the sister arts with which it was immediately con­ nected—music and the management of the chorus.
The last lines of the first fragment serve to confirm Mr. Clinton's suggestion, that he was born in the 59th Olympiad;
in which, ac­ cording to some accounts, he is said to have flourished;
—but, as he justly observes, these computations would suppose Theognis to have been near eighty in 490—the time of the battle of Marathon.
The concluding lines certainly give a decided negative to such a suppo­ sition.
The character of mature age (as has been already ob­ served) is marked in a preceding fragment (the last but two).
The same association of ideas is also observable in this, which must have been written a very short time after:
in both of them the pleasures of conviviality are connected with the fear of death (the evil with its remedy);
but in extreme age such remedies are not resorted to;
moreover, old age itself is here spoken of as a distant evil.
May Jove, the almighty, with his own right hand 755-66 Guard and uphold this happy town and land, With all the glorious blessed gods above!
And may the bright Apollo guide and move My voice and fancy, cunningly to carp
In songs accordant to the pipe and harp!
When, after solemn rites of sacrifice, At feasts and banquets, freely we devise Of mirth and pastime ;
banishing afar All fears of Persia and her threatened war;
With joyous airy songs of merry verse, Quaffing and chaunting, " May we ne'er be worse," But better;
if a better thing can be, Than thus to live at ease, cheerful and free ;
While far remote, no fears our thoughts engage, Of death approaching, or disastrous age.
The next fragment is of the same time, as appears not only from the tone and character, but from the same mention of an appre­ hended invasion from Persia.
-It may be considered as a kind of sequel to the preceding;
the invocation to the inferior protecting deity of the town naturally following the prece ling address to the supreme ruler of the world.
This fragment is of considerable im­ portance, as Mr. Brunei, by comparing the lines in which Alca­ thous is mentioned with an inscription discovered at Megara, has shown that Theognis must have been a native of Megara in Greece, and not, as Plato (undoubtedly from a mere supercilious affectation of ignorance) has asserted, a Sicilian.
Moreover, it appears that Sicily is mentioned as one of the foreign countries visited by him during his long absence from his native land.
You, great Apollo, with its walls and towers 771-86 Fenced and adorn'd of old this town of ours!
Such favour in thy sight Alcathous won, Of Pelops old the fair and manly son.
Now, therefore, in thy clemency divine, Protect these very walls, our own and thine!
Guide and assist us, turn aside the boast
Of the destroying haughty Persian host!
So shall thy people each returning spring Slay fatted hecatombs, and gladly bring Fair gifts, with chaunted hymns and lively song, Dances and feasts, and happy shouts among:
Before thy altar, glorifying thee, In peace and health and wealth, cheerful and free.
Yet much I fear the faction and the strife, Throughout our Grecian cities, raging rife;
And their wild councils.
But do thou defend
This town of ours, our founder and our friend!
Wide have I wander'd, far beyond the sea, Even to the distant shores of Sicily, To broad Eubœa's plentiful domain, With the rich vineyards in its planted plain;
And to the sunny wave and winding edge
Of fair Eurotas, with its reedy sedge ;
Where Sparta stands in simple majesty, Among her manly rulers, there was I! Greeted and welcom'd (there and everywhere)
With courteous entertainment, kind and fair;
Yet still my weary spirit would repine, Longing again to view this land of mine.
Henceforward no design nor interest 787-90 Shall ever move me, but the first and best, With learning's happy gift to celebrate, To adorn and dignify my native state.
The song, the dance, music and verse agreeing, Will occupy my life, and fill my being :
Pursuits of elegance and learned skill 791-4 (With good repute and kindness and good will, Among the wiser sort) will pass my time Without an enemy, without a crime;
Harmless and just with every rank of men, Both the free native and the denizen.
The following lines show that his return was embittered by the tmdutiful behaviour of his family, who had grown up in his absence.
The gods in just allotment have assigned 271-8 Youth and old age, the portion of mankind, Alike for all;
impartially we share Youth's early pleasures ;
equally we bear
The latter ills of life, sickness and care.
I One single evil, more severe and rude
Than age or sickness or decrepitude, Is dealt unequally, for him that rears A thankless offspring ;
in his latter years, Ungratefully requited for his pains, A parsimonious life and thrifty gains, With toil and care acquired for their behoof;
And no return !
but insolent reproof;
Such as might scare a beggar from the gate, A wretch unknown, poor and importunate! -
To be revil'd, avoided, hated, curst ;
This is the last of evils, and the worst!
Theognis had left his wife, and at least one son, behind him, when he quitted Megara;
some verses written in the early part of his banishment, serve to show that she was behaving well in his absence.
There are no further notices to be found respecting her -but a family of children, growing up under the tuition and pro­ tection of the ruling party, would probably become connected with them, and would be liable to be extremely disgusted and annoyed at the return of so near a connexion, who, abjuring rank and pre­ tensions of every kind, had subsisted for many years as a mere artist, and who now reappeared with a fixed determination to con­ fine himself scrupulously to those pursuits by which he had before obtained a livelihood;
all the money which he had made in Sicily would not compensate for such a mortification.
The following lines would be wholly out of place in the earlier years of his exile, (at Thebes or Eubcea,) or in the tumultuous times which immediately preceded;
and if we go back to a still earlier period, we find that the system of secrecy and reserve which he then practised (see fragm.
IX.) is that which (in allusion perhaps to his former habit) he now condemns.
The servant of the Muse, gifted and grae'd 767-70 With high preëminence of art and taste, Has an allotted duty to fulfil;
Bound to dispense the treasure of his skill, Without a selfish or invidious view;
Bound to recite and to compose anew.
Not to reserve his talent for himself
In secret, like a miser with his pelf.
THE END.
