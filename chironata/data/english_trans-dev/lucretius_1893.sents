OF the life of Lucretius but little information has reached us.
Ad nos vix tenuis famæ perlabitur aura.
That he was a Roman by birth, is inferred from the pas­ sages in his poem in which he speaks of the Roman world as his country,1 and of the Roman language as his native tongue.
2
As to the time of his birth, it is stated by Eusebius in his Chronicon, that he was born in the second year of the hundred and seventy-first Olympiad, or ninety-five years before Christ.
At this period, Ennius had been dead about seventy years ;
Cicero was in his twelfth year;
twenty-five years were to elapse before the birth of Virgil, and four before that of Julius Caesar.
His style, indeed, would make him seem older, but its antiquated character may be partly affected, in imitation, perhaps, of Ennius, for whom he expresses great veneration.
3
Concerning his family nothing is known.
The name of Lucretius, from the time of Lucretia downwards, occurs fre­ quently in the history of Rome, with the surnames Tricipiti­ nus, Cinna, Ofella, and others, attached to it;
but with whom the poet was connected, or from whom descended, it is impossi­ ble to discover.
There was a Lucretius Vespillo contemporary with him, a senator, mentioned by Cicero and Caesar,5 of whom Lambinus conjectures that he may have been the brother;
suggesting that the one brother, by engaging in public life, might have attained senatorial dignity, while the other, devoting himself to literature and retirement, might have continued in the equestrian or even plebeian rank, in which he was born.
But all this is mere empty conjecture.
Equally groundless is the supposition, started also by Lain­ binus, that in his youth he went to Athens to study, and there, under the instruction of Zeno, who was then at the head of the Epicureans, became imbued with the doctrines of Epi­ curus.
That he attached himself to the tenets of Epicurus is certain, but when or where he studied them is not now to be ascertained.
Dunlop, however, asserts that "Lucretius was sent, with other young Romans of rank, to study at Athens.”
1
Thus it is that errors creep into biography and history;
the learned conjecture, and the less learned affirm.
Lambinus suggests that Lucretius might have gone to Athens, Dunlop states that he did go;
Lambinus says that it is probable, Dunlop says it is fact.
He wrote his poem, or part of it, as appears from a passage near the beginning of the first book,2 at a time when the Roman commonwealth was in a disturbed state;
but whether the disorders to which he alludes were, as is generally supposed, those excited by Catiline, or, as Forbiger suggests, those which were raised by Clodius eight years afterwards, there is no means of deciding.
His poem and his life, if we may trust Eusebius, were ended in the manner following. “
Having been driven to madness by an amatory potion, and having composed several books in the intervals of his insanity, which Cicero afterwards cor­ rected, he died by his own hand in the forty-fourth year of his age."
By whom the potion was administered, is conjec­ tured only from a passage in St. Jerome, who says that a cer­ tain Lucilia killed her husband or her lover, by giving him a philtre which was intended to secure his love, but of which the effect was to render him insane.
3
This Lucilia is supposed to have been the wife or mistress of Lucretius, but by whom the supposition was first made, I am not able to discover.
He is said by Donatus, or whoever wrote the old Life of Virgil, to have died on the day on which Virgil assumed the toga virilis.
That Cicero corrected what he wrote, there is, except from the passage in Eusebius, no indication.
From a passage in Varro,1 it has been concluded that he wrote many more books than have reached us;
for “ Lucre­ tius," says he, "suorum unius et viginti librorum initium fecit hoc:
Ætheris et terræ genitabile quaerere tempus."
But Lambinus has very plausibly conjectured that for Lu­ cretius should be substituted Lucilius, or the name of some other writer unknown to us.
This is the more probable, observes Eichstadt, as Varro was older than Lucretius, and was not accustomed to draw examples and testimonies from younger writers.
From the six books, as they now stand, there is no infer­ ence to be drawn that more were written.
That something more was intended is perhaps true;
for when we consider how the sixth book breaks off, we must either suppose that he designed to write a conclusion to it, or that he meant an­ other book to follow.
He signifies, however,2 that he was drawing to the conclusion of his undertaking;
and, indeed, the doctrines of Epicurus are so fully set forth in the six books, that little more could have been added respecting them.
It is true that there are two or three allusions among the grammarians to passages and verses which are not now found in the six books;
allusions which have led to the belief that there were more books, but which, with other considerations, led Spalding, the editor of Quintilian,3 to the suspicion that there were two editions given by the author himself, and that, though the second was generally followed, the first was not quite forgotten.
Thus the 937th verse of the first book, which is now read, " Contingunt mellis dulci flavoque liquore," is cited by Quintilian, " Aspirant mellis dulci flavoque liquore."
And Servius, on those lines in the Georgics,4 " Non ego cuncta meis amplecti versibus opto;
Non mihi si linguae centum sint oraque centum, Ferrea vox," says, “ The verses are Lucretius's;
but he has ænea vox, not ferrea;
” verses which are not now to be found in Lucretius.
This notion of two editions Eichstadt has noticed at some length in his dissertation, De Lucretii Vitâ et Carmine ;
and Forbiger has written a long essay to show that Lucretius's verses have been much altered.
“ Fateor enim," says For­ biger,1 “ ex quo primùm Lucretii carmen, studiosiùs perlege­ rim operamque meam ei navaverim, plures mihi oblatas esse causas suspicandi, nobis in his sex de rerum natura libris non unius Lucretii, sed duorum scriptorum longè diversorum manum agnoscendam, ideoque hune etiam auctorem iis annu­ merandum esse, quorum scripta a serioribus multis in locis mutata, aucta vel contracta, emendata vel corrupta, denique longè alia ab ea, quam auctor ipsis dederit, formâ induta, ad nostra tempera pervenerint." "
I confess, that since I first read the poem of Lucretius with attention, and bestowed serious labour upon it, many reasons occurred to me for sus­ pecting that, in these six books concerning the nature of things, we have to recognise, not the hand of Lucretius alone, but those of two writers of far different characters;
and that this author is therefore to be numbered with those, whose works have come down to us altered in many places by later writers ;
having been augmented or diminished in bulk, amended or corrupted, and invested with a different form from that which the author himself gave them."
But per­ haps, in the case of Lucretius, the variations which we find in the verses which are cited from him, are to be attributed, not to any regular revision or emendation of his writings, but to the casual mistakes of transcribers, and the lapse of memory in grammarians.
Perhaps also passages, containing verses cited by Servius and others, have been lost.
Lach­ mann, the last editor, finds, or imagines that he finds, defi­ ciencies in several pages.
The Memmius to whom the poem is addressed, was, as Lambinus and others think, Caius Memmius Gemellus, a Roman knight, who is described by Cicero2 as "a learned man, well-read in Greek, but disdainful of Latin literature;
a clever orator, and of an agreeable style;
but shrinking from the labour, not only of speaking, but even of thinking;
and doing injustice to his ability by his want of industry."
He became prætor, and after his prætorship had the province of Bithynia, to which he was accompanied by Catullus the poet.
Being supported by Cæsar, he stood for the consulship, but was unsuccessful, and, after being accused and condemned of bribery, went into exile at Patræ, where he died.
Cicero defended him on his trial, and addressed to him some letters which may be found in the thirteenth book of his Epistles to his friends.
1The general voice of criticism has awarded to Lucretius high praise as a poet.
The earliest notice which we find of his works, is that of Cicero in a letter to his brother Quintus,2 in which he says, as the passage stands in Ernesti, Lucretii poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt;
non multis luminibus ingenii, multæ tamen artis. "
The poetry of Lucretius is such as you say;
having not much splendour of genius, but a great deal of art."
Wakefield would omit the non, but is opposed by Eichstadt and Schutz, and by general opinion.
3
Cicero, how­ ever, if we read his words rightly, seems hardly to do justice to the poet,4 or to hit the general character of his work.
To us, of the present day, he appears to be chiefly distinguished by a rough vigour, and to have been anxious rather to express his thoughts strongly, than to clothe them in elegance or niceties of language.
Not that he disdained poetical beauties, for Virgil and others have found in him many worthy of adop­ tion ;
but vigour and animation seemed to have been his chief aim.
Statius did him more justice, when he spoke of the docti furor arduus Lucret, “ the lofty rage of the learned Lucretius.”
6
Ovid thoroughly understood his merit, and pre­ dicted that his poem was destined to be immortal:
Carmina sublimis tune aunt peritura Lucreti, Exitio terras cum dabit una dies.
7 Cornelius Nepos ranks him in elegance with Catullus;
for speaking of a certain Julius Calidus, who was rescued from proscription by Pomponius Atticus, he calls hint “ the most elegant poet since the death of Catullus and Lucretius."
Quintilian 2 gives him similar praise, saying that he is elegans in suâ materiâ, elegant in his peculiar department, though he thinks him "difficult" for the student.
Aulus Gellius calls him a poet “ excelling ingenio et facundiâ, in genius and force of language;
" Serenus Sammonicus4 styles him the great Lucretius;
" and Velleius Paterculus,5 Vitruvius,6 Seneca, Macrobius,8 and Pliny the younger,9 notice him as ranked among the most eminent poets, though without bestowing on him any specific commendation.
He is recognised in a simi­ lar way by Propertius10 and Tacitus.
11There was therefore little cause for Dunlop to complain of "the slight mention that is made of Lucretius by succeeding Latin authors," and of "the coldness with which he is spoken of by all Roman critics and poets, with the exception of Ovid."
Horace, indeed, who makes abundant mention of Ennius and Lucilius, has, it must be acknowledged, not named Lucretius.
Dunlop, to account for this silence of Horace, and the sup­ posed intended silence of others, suggests that “ the spirit of free-thinking which pervaded his writings, may have rendered it unsuitable or unsafe to extol his poetical talents.
There was a time," he adds, “ when, in this country, it was thought scarcely decorous or becoming to express high admiration of the genius of Rousseau and Voltaire."
With reference to Horace, and his times, there may have been some ground for this supposition.
Cicero, in his De Amicitiâ,12 introduces Lae­ lius saying that " he does not agree with those who have lately begun to assert that souls perish together with their bodies, and that death makes an end of all." " I rather sub­ mit myself," he continues, "to the authority of the ancients, or of our own forefathers, who appointed religious rites for the dead;
rites which they would not have instituted, bad they thought that the dead could not be affected by them, * * * or to the authority of him who was pronounced by the oracle of Apollo the wisest of men ;
and who did not on this, as on most subjects, assert sometimes one thing and sometimes an­ other, but maintained invariably the same opinion, that the souls of men are divine, and that, when they are released from the body, a return to heaven is open to them, and first of all to the best and most worthy.
But," he concludes, as if un­ willing to side too closely with either party, “ should the opinion of those be true, who think that the soul and the body perish together, and that all sense is terminated by their separation, death will then be attended with neither good nor evil.
"The moderns have certainly not been less willing to praise Lucretius than the ancients.
Barthius and Turnebus2 com­ mend the attractive simplicity of his antique Latinity;
Cri­ nitus and Casaubon 3 speak of his style in a similar manner;
and Julius Scaliger4 calls him “a divine man, and incompar­ able poet."
The eulogies bestowed upon him by Lam bin us, Faber, and his other commentators, I omit, as they might be regarded as the offspring of partiality.
Our own countrymen have not been behind others in offer­ ing their tribute of admiration, as exhibited in editions, trans­ lations, remarks, and quotations.
Dr. Warton, in his Essay on Pope,5 calls the Nature of Things "the noblest descriptive poem extant," and has most happily illustrated the poet's vigour of conception and execution:
“ The Persians," says he, “ distinguish the different degrees of the strength of fancy in different poets, by calling them painters or sculptors.
Lu­ cretius, from the force of his images, should be ranked among the latter.
He is, in truth, a sculptor-poet.
His images have a bold relief "
If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system," says Lord Byron,6 "we should have had a far superior poem to any now in existence.
As mere poetry, it is the first of Latin poems."
But the most discriminating and ample praise, that has been given him by any English author, is that of Dryden :
7“ If I am not mistaken," says he, “ the distinguishing cha- meter of Lucretius, I mean of his soul and genius, is a certain kind of noble pride, and positive assertion of his own opinions.
He is every where confident of his own reason, and assuming an absolute command, not only over his vulgar readers, but even his patron Memmius;
for he is always bidding him at­ tend, as if he had the rod over him, and using a magisterial authority, while he instructs him.
* * *
He seems to disdain all manner of replies, and is so confident of his cause, that he is beforehand with his antagonists ;
urging for them whatever he imagined they could say, and leaving them, as he supposes, without an objection for the future.
All this too with so much scorn and indignation, as if he were assured of the tri­ umph before he entered into the lists.
“From this sublime and daring genius of his, it must of necessity come to pass, that his thoughts must be masculine, full of argumentation, and that sufficiently warm.
From the same fiery temper proceeds the loftiness of his expressions, and the perpetual torrent of his verse, when the barrenness of his subject does not too much restrain the quickness of his fancy.
For there is no doubt to be made, but that he could have been every where as poetical as he is in his descriptions, and in the moral part of his philosophy, if he had not aimed more to instruct in his system of nature, than to delight.
"With regard to the subject of his poem, Lucretius is to be contemplated as a natural and moral philosopher.
The physical part of his philosophy, and most, indeed, of the moral part, he took from Epicurus, who, as Cicero1 observes, had previously adopted his physics from Democritus.
Of this, the great principle is, that nothing can proceed from nothing,2 and that, consequently, this world, in which we live, and every other object in the universe, was formed from matter that previously existed.
How this matter came to exist, we need not inquire;
we are to suppose that it existed always.
In its original state it was an infinitude of detached atoms, moving or falling through unlimited space;
for that space is unlimited is by Lucretius elaborately proved.
3
These atoms are infrangible and indestructible;
for matter is not infinitely divisible ;
there must be a point at which di- vision ends.
They are hard and solid, or they would be un­ able to endure agitation and attrition throughout an infinity of ages.
1
They are of different shapes, suited for the forma­ tion of various substances by combination.
2
The number of their forms, however, is limited;
but the number of each form is infinite.
3
The atoms were moving;
but whence had they the begin­ ning of motion ?
From their own gravity;
for all bodies move downwards by their own weight.
4
This is the com­ mencement of absurdity in the system;
for, if space be infi­ nite, one direction in it cannot be called downwards more than another;
as Lucretius himself indeed acknowledges, observing that nil est funditus imum;
5 nor can any reason be assigned why an atom should move from one part of infinite space to another.
This commencement of motion, however, being assumed, it is next to be shown how atoms combined.
Had they all moved, as might have been supposed, in straight lines, as they fell or proceeded through space, there could have been no coalition among them, unless the heavier had overtaken the lighter.
But Lucretius, or Epicurus, had sufficient conception of the motion of bodies in empty space, to understand that light bodies must move through it as speedily as heavy ones, and that, consequently, one atom could not overtake another.,
It was necessary, therefore, to make some of them deviate from the straight or perpendicular line, and it is accordingly as­ sumed that some do deviate from it.
“ This supposition," says Cicero,7 "is mere puerility;
for he introduces the devia­ tion arbitrarily;
he makes some atoms decline from the straight course without cause ;
and to say that any thing takes place without a cause is to a natural philosopher the most disgrace­ ful of all things.
To assert, too, that some decline, and some go straight onwards, is, as it were, to give properties and duties to atoms despotically, determining which is to go in a right line, and which obliquely.
"But when, from partial deviations, some had come in con­ tact with others, they began to form combinations.
They strove, as it were, for a long time ineffectually,8 but at length the larger and heavier atoms coalesced into the denser sub­ stances, as earth and water;
the smaller and lighter, into more subtle matters, as air and fire.
From combinations of such substances arose plants and animals;
as trees and worms still spring from the earth when it is moistened and warmed.
Of the rise of animals in general, and of man especially, the reader will find an ample account, according to the notions of Epi­ curus, in the fifth book.
1
Nature does not abhor a vacuum.
On the contrary, it is necessary that there should be, throughout the whole of mat­ ter, certain portions of empty space, or the movement of par­ ticles would be utterly impeded.
Water, for instance, could not be a liquid, unless there were vacuities among its atoms to allow them to yield to pressure.
2Man consists of a body and a soul.
The body is constituted of coarser, and the soul of finer matter.
Both are produced together, and grow up and decay together;
at death, the con­ nexion between them is dissolved;
the soul takes its departure, to be decomposed, and mingled with other matter;
and the body begins to decay, that it may undergo a similar fate.
The mind is intimately connected with the soul;
so inti­ mately that they must be said to form one substance.
Both are composed of heat, vapour, air, and a certain fourth sub­ stance, which has no name, but which is the most important of the four, as being the origin of motion in the whole man.
That both are wholly corporeal is indisputable, from their power to act on the body:
Tangere enim et tangi, nisi corpus, nulla potest res.3Ideas of objects in the mind are produced by the mysteri­ ous action of images of things on the soul and intellect;
images of a light vapoury substance, which are perpetually passing off from the surface of all bodies whatsoever, and exhibiting the exact resemblance of the objects from which they are de­ tached.
Other images, too, are formed spontaneously in the atmosphere, as we see clouds, at times, form themselves into likenesses of things on the face of the sky.
Of images, ac­ cordingly, the number is infinite, so that, whenever a man wishes to think on any thing, the image of it is generally ready to present itself for his contemplation.
If he cannot recollect what he wishes to think on, he may consider that an image of it is not at hand.
Dreams are excited by images, which, as they pass through the air, penetrating the coverings of the body, come in contact with such atoms of the soul as are at the surface of the body, and thus communicate their impres­ sions to the whole of the soul and mind.
Vision is produced by the same images flying off from the surface of the objects at which we look, and striking on the eye.
Reflection from mirrors, and other smooth surfaces, is produced by the image first striking the reflecting plane, and then being reverberated to the eye.
Voice, like all sounds, is a corporeal substance, because it frequently, as it passes forth, causes abrasion of the throat, and because much speaking ex­ hausts the corporeal frame by detraction of atoms.
1The members and organs of the body were not formed with a design that they might be used;
for there could have been no design in the offspring of fortuitously meeting atoms ;
but, as they have been formed, and we find them capable of being used, we apply them, accordingly, to the uses for which they seem adapted.
The feet were not formed for walking, but, as we find they enable us to walk, we employ them in walking.
2
Of all our knowledge the foundation must rest on the per­ ceptions of our senses.
To our senses we can assuredly trust, for what shall refute them ?
Will any thing distinct from them refute them, or will they refute one another?
That which shall convict them of falsehood must be more trust- worthy than they;
but what can be more trust-worthy ?
What shall convince us that those bodies which appear to the senses square, or hot, or black, are not possessed of those qualities ?
3The motions and combinations of atoms being established, all natural phenomena, as thunder, lightning, rain, earth­ quakes, are easily shown to arise from their changes of place and effects on one another.
4
Even were it not demonstrable that the world was for­ tuitously formed by the coalescence of atoms, it might yet be safely affirmed, from the numerous faults apparent in it, and from the various causes of suffering to animal life which it contains, that it was not made by divine wisdom as an abode for living creatures.!
It sprung into being casually;
and animals, that casually sprung from it, make the best of that abode to which they are confined, and from which there is no release but death.
This world, which we inhabit, is not the only one in the universe.
2
The number of atoms being infinite, it is naturally to be supposed that they must have produced more worlds than one.
It is therefore probable that there are many worlds of many kinds.
And as these worlds have been gener­ ated, we may fairly argue that they also decay.
Men, other animals, and the trees of the forest, are born but to die;
and why should not a world be subject to the same fate as the things which grow in it ?
We see, indeed, the symptoms of decadence in the world which we inhabit;
for the present pro­ ductions of the earth are not of the same vigour as those of its earlier days.
All, then, around us, we may conclude is making progress towards dissolution;
the great globe will continue to sink and grow infirm, until at last, mouldering and disruptured, it scatters its atoms through surrounding space, to contribute to the formation of other worlds like or unlike itself.
Star after star from heaven's bright arch shall rush, Suns sink on suns, and systems systems crush;
Headlong, extinct, to one dark centre fall, And Death, and Night, and Chaos, mingle all.
Till, o'er the wreck, emerging from the storm, Immortal Nature lifts her changeful form, Mounts from her funeral pyre on wings of flame, And soars and shines another and the same.
Darwin.
Such were the general tenets of Lucretius as a natural philosopher;
tenets on which the reader will find him amply enlarging in the following pages.
His doctrines as a moral philosopher may be noticed with greater brevity.
His great boast as a moralist was, that he freed men from the terrors of death, and of suffering after death.
The soul, says he, when it is separated from the body, is dispersed among the matter from which it was collected, and the man ceases to be.
His atoms continue to exist, for they are indestructible, but his own existence, as an individual being, is no more.
He is separated into his parts, and his consciousness that he ever existed as a whole is at an end.
Of what has been, he will have no recollection;
of what shall be, he will have no knowledge.
Why then should he dread to die, when after death no suffering can ensue?
He that is about to die young, may felicitate himself that he shall escape that trouble and affliction of which some falls to the lot of every man;
he that dies at an advanced age, may be satisfied that he has had so long opportunity for those enjoyments of which no man fails to obtain some.
After a certain period life offers nothing new, and why should we seek to prolong it ?
1The greatest enjoyment of life consists in tranquil plea­ sure.
To labour for honour and dignities, which are unsatis­ factory when attained, is mere folly.
Nature has supplied every thing necessary to satisfy our wants, and to enable us to spend our existence in ease, contentment, and pleasure ;
if we only study the best method of making the most of what is set before us.
A wise man can live on a little;
and to live contentedly on a little is to be equal in enjoyment to him who has more than ourselves, and who, however much he may have, can have no solid satisfaction unless he is contented with that which he possesses.
2
The highest degree of wisdom that we can attain, is to be able to look down from the serene elevations of philosophy, on the unreasoning crowds wander­ ing beneath us, seeking for the path of happiness, and vainly hoping to find it in the pursuit of the splendours and distinc­ tions of the world.
3
Whether he really believed in the existence of gods, that is, of beings of a similar but superior nature to ourselves, it is not easy, from the perusal of his works, to decide.
He at times speaks of gods, like Epicurus, as certainly existing,4 and enjoying a state of tranquil felicity, unconcerned about the affairs of the world, and unaffected by human good or human evil.
5
At other times, he seems to consider them as mere creatures of the imagination, to which men have attributed, in the operations of nature, those effects of which they cannot discover the causes.
6The first edition of Lucretius was printed at Brescia, by Fer­ andus, without date, but, as Wakefield and others think, about the year 1470.
It is of all editiones principes the most rare.
The second edition appeared at Verona, printed by Freiden­ perger, in 1486, and the third at Venice, by T. de Ragazoni­ bus, in 1495.
From Venice, too, in 1500, came forth the first edition of Aldus;
and fifteen years afterwards the second, superintended by Naugerius, who did more to make his author intelligible than had been done in the former edition.
In the mean time, however, (1511,) had appeared at Bononia the edition of Baptista Pius, who brought much learning and ability to bear upon his author, and many of whose notes are still worthy of preservation.
The second edition of Aldus is said by Lachmann1 to have been greatly improved from the revised text of Michael Ma­ rullus, which was published from his manuscripts after his death, by Petrus Candidus, whose name the edition bears, at Florence, in 1512;
of which text succeeding editors have overlooked the merits, or have been unwilling to do justice to them.
But all other editions were thrown into the shade by those of Lambinus, of which the first appeared in 1563, the second in 1565, and the third in 1570.
Of all editors and expound­ ers of Lucretius, Lambinus still deserves to stand at the head.
He is accused by Wakefield of inconsulta temeritas, injudici­ ous rashness, in intruding his own conjectures into the text;
and by Eichstadt, of having had too high an opinion of his own judgment and ability;
but though there be some grounds for such accusations, his character as an editor is still of the highest order.
He brought to his work a powerful mind, and, knowing that Lucretius always intended to write sense, he took upon himself to put sense, perhaps at times too arbi­ trarily, into verses which had been left meaningless by tran­ scribers.
And it is surely no dishonour to him to have shown his contempt for such a man as Gifanius, who, in 1565, printed an edition at Antwerp, and whose annotations have little other claim to notice than that of attacking Lambinus with the meanness with which a low mind always attacks a higher.
There were some other editions, but of not much account, between Gifanius's and that of Tanaquil Faber, which was published in 1662, containing notes, brief indeed, but evincing the great learning and acuteness of the editor.
To Faber, in 1695, succeeded Creech.
His text is Lambi­ nus's with scarcely any variation, and though he never fails to expose a mistake of Lambinus when he finds one in his comment­ ary, he is very ready to profit by all Lambinus's instructions.
His interpretation after the manner of the Delphin editions, is of little use, for, wherever there is any difficulty of construction, he invariably abbreviates.
Yet, if we may credit the last editor, Lachmann, “ multa rectiùs interpretatus est quàm scripsit, in philosophiâ explicandA sane diligens, sed linguæ Latinæ imperitissimus."
This is too strong;
but there are in his notes inelegances and inaccuracies.
In 1725 appeared the splendid edition of Havercamp, which is extremely useful, as containing all the notes of Lambinus, Gifanius, Creech, and Faber, with a selection from those of Pius, and with a few, of considerable value, from Abrahamus Preigerus, a friend of Havercamp.
Of Havercamp's own there is comparatively little.
At length, in 1796, came out, with a dedication to Fox, the well-known edition of Wakefield.
Wakefield had discovered, by the inspection of a manuscript or two, that Lambinus had taken, as he thought, unjustifiable liberties with the text of Lucretius, and conceived that he should be enabled to re­ store it to something like its original integrity.
Had he been content to reinstate only those words or phrases which Lambinus or others had unreasonably ejected, he might have done greater service, but he replaced also such readings as any editor would have been blamed for suffering to remain.
I will give one instance.
In Lambinus and Creech the 863rd verse of the third book stands thus:
Interrupta semel quum sit repetentia nostra;
“ repetentia nostra," our memory or recollection.
This is in­ telligible;
but Wakefield finding in manuscripts nostris, re­ placed it as a crux to his reader, who, as soon as he comes to it, is stuck fast.
What, he inquires, is to be understood with nostris?
It is in vain to seek for any thing in what precedes, and he must consult Wakefield's notes to find that, according to Wakefield's notion, rebus must be supplied.
How mich the difficulties in an author may be increased by such changes is easily conceivable;
but he who has only read Lambinus or Creech's edition of Lucretius, can have no conception how much the difficulties in Lucretius have been increased by Wakefield's arbitrary alterations.
Whether Wakefield ever "construed through a brick wall," I do not know;
but that he has raised abundance of brick walls through which others are left to construe, is manifest.
There is in his notes, besides other unnecessary matter, a vast quantity of super­ fluous railing at the inscitia and inverecundia of Lambinus, and the inscitia and stupor of Creech, of which the reader may see an average specimen on vi. 582, and in various other places.
A man worthy to edit Lucretius should have for­ borne to apply the term inscitia to such a predecessor as Lambinus.
In 1801, Wakefield's text was reprinted at Leipsic by Eichstadt, who had previously obtained repute by his edition of Diodorus Siculus.
The first volume, containing the text of the six books, judicious prolegomena, and an excellent in­ dex, is the only one that has appeared.
In 1828 came forth the edition of Forbiger, which, chiefly perhaps from the convenience of its size, has been much used.
His text is Wakefield's, with but very few alterations, and all his explanations of passages are Wakefield's.
His work, says Lachmann, was mercenary;
and it would be doing him great injustice to suppose him capable of seeing any thing by the light of his own intellect.
In 1850, at Berlin, appeared Lachmann's edition, in two thin volumes octavo.
He is a little too fond of transposing verses, and discovering deficiencies in the text, but deserves great commendation for restoring many readings that Wake­ field had ejected.
His notes are not at all explanatory, but are wholly occupied about changes in the text.
With regard to versions of Lucretius, the earliest attempt to render him into English was made by John Evelyn, the author of " Sylva," who, in 1656, published the first book in verse, with a commentary.
His lady designed the frontispiece, and Waller prefixed a copy of verses.
The translation is faithful, but tame.
In 1682 was published the translation by Creech, which, as the first complete version of the poet, was cordially welcomed.
Evelyn furnished some laudatory couplets, saying how much he was pleased that the entire work had fallen to more vigor­ ous hands than his own.
Duke, Tate, and Otway gave also their tribute of verse, and Creech was every where known as the English Lucretius.
But posterity have had time to dis­ covel the faults in his performance.
Many of his lines are vigorous, but many are stiff and awkward ;
and the licences which he has taken with the original are almost beyond be­ lief.
Whoever will look at the commencement of his first book, will find that between the tenth and sixteenth verses he inserts five lines of his own.
Similar interpolations may be found in other places;
and he likewise curtails with equal freedom whenever it suits his purpose.
About the same time Dryden produced some translations, or rather paraphrases, of particular passages, executed with his usual vigour.
In 1743 there appeared, in two volumes octavo, a prose translation, which Good calls Guernier's, but which was the work of an unknown hand.
Guernier, with others, furnished the plates.
The version is but indifferent.
Some parts of it, though printed as prose, run into blank verse.
In 1799 the first book was translated in rhyme by an anonymous author;
and in 1808, also in rhyme, by the Rev. W. Hamilton Drummond.
Both versions have merit, but the greater share of praise belongs to Mr. Drummond.
In 1805 Dr. Good laid before the public his two quarto volumes, containing a version of the whole poem in blank verse, with copious notes.
This translation is in general pleasing and animated, but some parts are rather stiff.
Taken as a whole it is by far the best extant, and is deemed, by my publisher, a desirable addition to the present volume.
In 1813 was published by subscription, in two pompous volumes quarto, the rhymed version of Thomas Busby, Mus. D. He is, to do him justice, tolerably faithful to the sense, but his couplets are far inferior to those of Mr. Drummond's First Book.
His notes are heavy and tedious;
and all his learning second-hand.
The whole book reminds the reader of the com­ mencement of his well-known prologue, which Lord Byron, says Moore, unnecessarily travestied:
When energizing objects men pursue
What are the prodigies they cannot do!
In French, Lucretius has been translated several times.
The earliest version is that of the Abbé de Marolles, in prose, published in 1650, which has not obtained more esteem than his other translations of classical authors.
In 1685 another prose translation was published by the Baron de Coutures, which is paraphrastic, but seems tolerably faithful to the sense.
In 1768 La Grange published a third, which gives the thoughts of the poet with exactness, but wants vigour and animation;
and in 1794 Le Blanc de Guillet brought out a fourth, in verse, which I have not minutely examined, but on which his coun­ trymen set no very high value.
The last, in 1825, was that of Pongerville, in prose, rather a paraphrase than a transla­ lion, and preserving nothing of the sententiousness of Lu­ cretius.
The Italian version of Marchetti, in blank verse, published in London 1717, and since several times reprinted, has always been highly esteemed.
The Germans have three translations;
one by Mayr, 1784, in prose, which Degen, cited by Moss, calls “ pretty accurate another by Meineke, 1795, in hexameter verse, which is ge­ nerally considered faithful to the sense;
and the last by Kne­ bel, 1821, which is also in hexameter verse, and which is the most highly valued of the three.
The Dutch have a prose translation by De Wit, printed in 1701, which Good says that he had seen, "but without being induced to imitate it.”I beg leave to observe, that, in the notes attached to the following translation, I have not taken upon me to refute any of the doctrines of Lucretius or Epicurus.
To have offered formal refutations of them would have occupied more space than could be afforded in the present volume;
and many of them, in these days, require no refutation.
I have there­ fore restricted myself to discharging that which Dryden ad­ monishes me to be the duty of a translator,—to do my author all the right I can, and to translate It;
. to the best advantage.
Those who seek for arguments against his tenets, physical or moral, may find them in Lactantius ;
in Arnobius;
in the Anti-Lucretius of Cardinal Polignac ;
in the Bridgewater Treatises ;
and in abundance of other English books.
The famous refutation by Cardinal Polignac, called Anti- Lucretius, I might have quoted in every page;
and the reader will perhaps wonder that I have not done so.
But I for­ bore to quote him, as I forbore to quote others.
He assailed Lucretius with great determination;
his versification, though deficient in Lucretian ardour, is always respectable, and some­ times elevated;
and he would perhaps be more read, had he not unluckily, as Voltaire observes, when he attacted Lucre­ tius attacked Newton.
Lucretius invokes Venus as the great cause of production, ver. 1—44.
He then dedicates his work to Memmius;
praises Epicurus, whose doctrine he follows;
vindicates his subject from the charge of impiety;
exposes the emptiness of the religious system of his day, and the fictions of the poets;
and introduces, not without allusion to the difficulties to be over­ come, the great arguments of which he proposes to treat, ver. 45—159.
Entering upon his subject, he shows, first, that nothing can proceed from ^ nothing, and that nothing can return to nothing, ver. 160—265.
Secondly, that there are certain minute corpuscles, which, though imperceptible to our senses, are conceivable in our minds, and from which all things origin­ ate, ver. 266—329.
Thirdly, that there is vacuum or empty space, ver. 330—430.
Fourthly, that there is nothing in the universe but body and space, and that all other things which are said TO BE, are only adjuncts or events, properties or accidents of body and space, ver. 431—483.
He then proceeds to demonstrate that the primary corpuscles, or elements of things, are perfectly solid, indivisible, and eternal, ver. 484—635.
He re­ futes those who had held other opinions, as Heraclitus, who said that fire was the origin of things;
and others, who had maintained the same of air, water, and earth, ver. 636—712.
He attacks Empedocles, who said that the universe was compounded of the four elements, and Anaxagoras, who advocated the homœomeria, ver. 713—919.
He then contends that the universe is boundless, that atoms are infinite in number, and that space must he unlimited, ver. 920—1050.
Lastly, he refutes those who think that there is a centre of things, to which heavy bodies tend downwards, and light bodies upwards;
and concludes with a praise of philosophy, which assists mankind to penetrate the mysteries of nature.
O BOUN riFUL Venus,1 mother of the race of Æneas,2 delight of gods and men, who, beneath the gliding constellations of heaven,3 fillest with life4 the ship-bearing sea and the fruit-producing earth;
5 since by thy influence every kind of living creature is conceived, and, springing forth, hails the light of the sun.
Thee, 0 goddess, thee the winds flee ;
be­ fore thee, and thy approach, the clouds of heaven disperse;
for thee the variegated earth2 puts forth3 her fragrant flowers;
on thee the waters of ocean smile, and the calmed heaven beams with effulgent4 light.
For, as soon as the vernal face of day5 is unveiled, and the genial gale of Favonius exerts its power unconfined, the birds of the air first, 0 goddess, testify of thee and thy coming, smitten in heart by thy influ­ ence.
Next, the wild herds bound over the joyous pastures, and swim across the rapid streams.
So all kinds of living creatures, captivated by thy charms and thy allurements, eagerly follow thee whithersoever thou proceedest to lead them.
In fine, throughout seas, and mountains, and whelming rivers,6 and the leafy abodes of birds, and verdant plains, thou, infusing balmy love into the breasts of all, causest them eagerly to propagate their races after their kind.
Since thou alone dost govern7 all things in nature, neither does any thing without thee spring into the ethereal realms of light, nor any thing become gladsome or lovely;
I desire thee to be my associate8 in this my song, which I am essaying to compose on the NATURE OF THINGS,1 for the instruction of my friend Memmius,2 whom thou, 0 goddess, hast willed at all times to excel, graced with every gift.
The more therefore do thou, 0 goddess, bestow on my words an immortal charm.
Cause the fierce pursuits of war meanwhile to cease, being lulled to rest throughout all seas and lands.
For thou alone canst bless mortals with tranquil peace;
since Mars, the lord of arms, who controls the cruel tasks of war, often flings3 himself upon thy lap, vanquished by the eternal wound of love;
4 and thus looking up, his graceful neck5 thrown back, he feasts his eager eyes with love, gazing intently on thee, O goddess, and his breath, as he reclines, hangs on thy lips.
Bending over him, 0 goddess, as he reposes, to embrace him1 with thy sacred person, pour from thy lips sweet con­ verse, entreating unruffled peace, illustrious divinity, for thy Romans.
For neither can we pursue our task2 with tranquil mind, in this untraquil time3 of our country;
nor can the illustrious scion of Memmius, at such a crisis, desert the com­ mon interest.
For what remains,4 lend me, 0 Memmius, thy unprejudiced ears,5 and apply thyself, released from cares, to the investiga­ tion of truth, and leave not, as things despised, my offerings arranged for thee with faithful zeal, before they are under­ stood.
For I shall proceed to discourse to thee of the whole system6 of heaven and the gods, and unfold to thee the first principles of all things,7 from which nature produces, developes, and sustains all, and into which she again resolves them at their dissolution :
8 these, in explaining our subject, we are accustomed to call matter, and the generative bodies of things, and to designate as the seeds of all things, and to term them primary bodies, because from them as primary all things are derived.
[For the whole nature of the gods1 must necessarily, of itself, enjoy immortality in absolute repose, separated, and far removed, from our affairs;
for, exempt from all pain, exempt from perils, all-sufficient in its own resources, and needing nothing from us, it is neither propitiated by ser­ vices from the good, nor affected with anger against the bad.]
When the life of men lay foully grovelling before our eyes, crushed beneath the weight of a Religion,3 who displayed her head from the regions of the sky, lowering over mortals with terrible aspect, a man of Greece4 was the first that dared to raise mortal eyes against her, and first to make a stand against her.
Him neither tales of gods,5 nor thunderbolts, nor heaven itself with its threatening roar, repressed, but roused the more the active energy of his soul, so that he should de sire to be the first to break the close bars of nature's portals.
Accordingly the vivid force of his intellect prevailed, and pro­ ceeded far beyond the flaming battlements1 of the world, and in mind and thought traversed the whole immensity of space;
hence triumphant, he declares to us what can arise into being, and what can not;
in fine, in what way the powers of all things are limited, and a deeply-fixed boundary assigned to each.
By which means Religion, brought down under our feet, is bruised in turn ;
and his victory 2 sets us on a level with heaven.
In treating of these subjects, I fear thou mayest haply think that thou art entering on forbidden elements of phi­ losophy, and commencing a course of crime.
Whereas, on the contrary, that much-extolled Religion3 has too fre­ quently given birth to criminal and impious deeds;
as when at Aulis the chosen leaders of the Greeks, the chief of men, foully stained the altar of the virgin Trivia with the blood of Iphigenia.
When the fillet, clasping her virgin tresses, drop­ ped from each cheek in equal length, and she saw her sire stand sorrowing before the altars, and the attendant priests, close by him,4 concealing th3 knife, and her countrymen shedding tears at the sight of her, she, dumb with fear, dropping on her knees, sank to the earth;
nor could it, at such a time, avail the hapless maiden that she had been the first to bless the king with the name of father.
For, raised by the hands of men, and trembling, she was led to the altar;
not that, the solemn service of sacrifice being performed, she might be accompanied with the loud bridal hymn;
but spotless, though stained, she might, even in her wedding prime, fall a sad victim by her father's immolating hand, that a successful and fortunate voyage might be granted to the fleet.
To such evils could Religion persuade mankind JWilt thou too, overcome by the frightful tales of bards, ever seek to turn away from me ?
Surely not;
for doubt­ less I, even now, could invent for thee many dreams, which might disturb the tenor of thy life, and confound all thy enjoyments with terror.
And with reason too under the present system of belief;
for did men but know that there was a fixed limit to their woes, they would be able, in some measure, to defy the religious fictions and menaces of the poets;
but now, since we must fear eternal pun­ ishment at death, there is no mode, no means, of resisting them.
For men know not what the nature of the soul is;
whether it is engendered with us, or whether, on the con­ trary, it is infused into us at our birth,2 whether it perishes with us, dissolved by death, or whether it haunts the gloomy shades and vast pools of Orcus, or whether, by divine in­ fluence, it infuses itself into other animals, as our Ennuis1 sung, who first brought from pleasant Helicon a crown of never-fading leaf, which should be distinguished in fame throughout the Italian tribes of men ;
though in addition, how­ ever, Ennius, setting it forth in deathless song, declares that there are temples of Acheron, whither neither our souls nor our bodies penetrate, but only phantoms, strangely pale, from amongst whom he relates that the apparition of undying Ho­ mer, rising up before him, began to pour forth briny tears, and to expound in words the nature of things.
Wherefore with reason then, not only an inquiry concerning celestial affairs is to be accurately made by us, (as by what means the courses of the sun and moon are effected, and by what influence all things individually are directed upon the earth,) but especially also we must consider, with scrutinizing examination,1 of what the soul and the nature of the mind consist, and what it is, which, haunting us, sometimes when awake, and sometimes when overcome by disease or buried in sleep, terrifies the mind;
so that we seem to behold and to hear speaking before us, those whose bones, after death is passed, the earth embraces.
Nor does it escape my consideration, that it is difficult to explain in Latin verse the profound discoveries of the Greeks, especially since we must treat of much in novel words, on account of the poverty of our language, and the novelty of the subjects.
But yet thy virtues, and the expected pleasure of thy sweet friendship, prompt me to endure any labour whatsoever, and induce me to out-watch the clear cold nights,2 weighing with what words, with what possible verse,1 I may succeed in displaying to thy mind those clear lights, by which thou mayest be able to gain a thorough in­ sight into these abstruse sub ects.
This terror and darkness of the mind, therefore, it is not the rays of the sun, or the bright shafts of day,2 that must dispel, but reason and the contemplation of nature;
3 of which our first principle shall hence take its commence­ ment, THAT NOTHING IS EVER DIVINELY4 GENERATED FROM NOTHING.
For thus it is that fear restrains all men, because they observe many things effected on the earth and in heaven, of which effects they can by no means see the.
causes, and therefore think that they are wrought by a divine power.
For which reasons, when we shall have clearly seen that NOTHING CAN BE PRODUCED FROM NOTHING,5 we shall then have a more accurate perception of that of which we are in search, and shall understand whence each individual thing is generated, and how all things are done without the agency of the gods.
For if things came forth from nothing,6 every kind of thing might be produced from all things;
nothing would require seed.
In the first place, men might spring from the sea;
the scaly tribe, and birds, might spring from the earth ;
herds, and other cattle, might burst from the sky;
the culti­ vated fields, as well as the deserts, might contain every kind of wild animal, without any settled law of production:
nor would the same fruits be constant to the same trees, but would be changed ;
and all trees might bear all kinds of fruit.
Since, when there should not be generative elements for each pro­ duction, how could a certain parent-producer remain invariable for all individual things ?
But now, because all things are severally produced from certain seeds, each is produced, and comes forth into the regions of light, from that spot in which the matter, and first elements of each, subsist.
And for this cause all things cannot be produced from all, inasmuch as there are distinct and peculiar faculties in certain substances.
Besides, why do we see the rose put forth in spring,' corn in summer heat, and vines under the influence of autumn, if it be not because, when the determinate seeds of things have united together at their proper time, whatever is produced appears while the seasons are favourable, and while the vigorous earth securely brings forth her tender productions into the regions of light.
But if these were generated from nothing, they might arise suddenly at indefinite periods, and at unsuitable seasons of the year, inasmuch as there would be no original elements, which might be restrained from a generative combination at any season, however inconvenient.
Nor, moreover, would there be need of time for the coming together of seed2 for the growth of things, if they could grow out of nothing.
For young men might on a sudden be formed from puny infants, and groves, springing up anexpectedly, might dart forth from the earth ;
of which things it is plain that none happen, since all things grow gradually, as is fitting, from unvarying atoms, and, as they grow, preserve their kind, so that you may understand that all things individually are enlarged and nourished from their own specific matter.
Add to this, that the earth cannot furnish her cheering fruits without certain rains1 in the year;
nor, moreover, can the nature of animals, if kept from food, propagate their kind, and sustain life;
so that you may rather deem that many elements are common to many things, (as we see letters common to many words,) than that any thing can exist with­ out its proper elements.
Still further, why could not nature produce men of such2 a size that they might ford the sea on foot,3 and rend great moun­ tains with their hands, and outlast in existence many ages of human life, if it be not because certain matter has been assigned for producing certain things, from which matter it is fixed what can or cannot arise ?
It must be admitted therefore, that no­ thing can be made from nothing, since things have need of seed, from which all individually being produced, may be brought forth into the gentle air of heaven.
Lastly, since we observe that cultivated places excel4 the uncultivated, and yield to our hands better fruits, we may see that there are in the ground the primitive elements of things, which we, in turning the fertile glebe with the ploughshare, and subjugating the soil of the earth, force into birth.
But were there no such seeds, you might see things severally grow up and become much better of their own accord with­ out our labour.
Add, too,1 that nature resolves each thing into its own constituent elements, and DOES NOT REDUCE ANY THING TO NOTHING.
For if any thing were perishable in all its parts, every thing might then dissolve, being snatched suddenly from be­ fore our eyes;
for there would be no need of force to pro­ duce a separation of its parts, and break their connexion.
Whereas now, since all things individually consist of eternal seed, nature does not suffer the destruction of any thing to be seen, until such power assail them as to sever them with a blow, or penetrate inwardly through the vacant spaces, and dissolve the parts.
Besides, if time utterly destroys2 whatever things it removes through length of age, consuming all their constituent matter, whence does Venus restore to the light of life the race of animals according to their kinds ?
Whence does the varie­ gated earth nourish and develope them, when restored, af­ fording them sustenance according to their kinds ?
Whence do pure fountains, and eternal rivers flowing from afar, supply the sea?
3
Whence does the æther feed the stars?
For infinite time already past, and length of days, ought to have con­ sumed all things which are of mortal consistence:
but if those elements, of which this sum of things consists and is renewed, have existed through that long space, and that past duration of time, they are assuredly endowed with an immortal nature.
Things therefore cannot return to nothing.
Further, the same force1 and cause might destroy all things indiscriminately, unless an eternal matter held them more or less bound by mutual connexion.
For a mere touch, indeed, would be a sufficient cause of destruction, supposing that there were no parts of eternal consistence, but all perishable, the union of which any force might dissolved
But now, because various connexions of elements unite together, and matter is eternal, things continue of unimpaired consistence, until some force of sufficient strength be found to assail them, proportioned to the texture of each.
No thing, therefore, relapses into non- existence, but all things at dissolution return to the first principles of matter.
Lastly, you may say, perhaps, the showers of rain perish,3 when Father Ether has poured them down into the lap of Mother Earth.
But it is not so ;
for hence the smiling fruits arise, and the branches become verdant on the trees ;
the trees themselves increase, and are weighed down with produce.
Hence, moreover, is nourished the race of man, and that of beasts;
hence we see joyous cities abound with youth,4 and the leafy woods resound on every side with newly-fledged birds;
hence the weary cattle, sleek in the rich pastures, re­ pose their bodies, and the white milky liquor flows from their distended udders;
hence the new offspring gambol sportive, with tottering limbs, over the tender grass, their youthful hearts exhilarated with pure milk.
1
Things, therefore, do not utterly perish, which seem to do so, since Nature recruits one thing from another, nor suffers any thing to be produced, unless its production be furthered by the death of another.
Attend, now, further:
2 since I have shown that things can­ not be produced from nothing, and also that, when produced, they cannot return to nothing, yet, lest haply thou shouldst begin to distrust my words, because the primary particles of things cannot be discerned by the eye, hear, in addition, what substances thou thyself must necessarily confess to exist, al­ though impossible to be seen.
In the first place, the force of the wind, when excited, lashes the sea, agitates the tall ships, and scatters the clouds;
at times, sweeping over the earth with an impetuous hurricane, it strews the plains with huge trees, and harasses the moun­ tain-tops with forest-rending blasts ;
so violently does the deep chafe with fierce roar and rage with menacing murmur.
The winds, then, are invisible bodies, which sweep the sea, the land, the clouds of heaven, and, agitating them, carry them along with a sudden tornado.
Not otherwise do they rush forth, and spread destruction, than as when a body of liquid water3 is borne along in an overwhelming stream, which a vast tor* rent from the lofty mountains swells with large rain-floods, dashing together fragments of woods and entire groves ;
nor can the strong bridges sustain the sudden force of the sweep­ ing water, with such overwhelming violence does the river, turbid with copious rain, rush against the opposing mounds;
it scatters ruin with a mighty uproar, and rolls huge rocks under its waters;
it rushes on triumphant wheresoever any thing opposes its waves.
Thus, therefore, must the blasts of the wind also be borne along;
which (when, like a mighty flood, they have bent their force in any direction) drive alt things before them, and overthrow them with repeated as.
saults, and sometimes catch them up in a writhing vortex and rapidly bear them off in a whirling hurricane.
Where­ fore, I repeat, the winds are substances, though invisible, since in their effects, and modes of operation,2 they are found to rival mighty rivers, which are of manifest bodily substance.
Moreover we perceive various odours of objects, and yet never see them approaching our nostrils.
Nor do we behold violent heat, or distinguish cold with our eyes;
nor are we in the habit of viewing sounds;
all which things, however, must of necessity consist of a corporeal nature, since they have the power of striking the senses:
FOR NOTHING, EXCEPT BODILY SUBSTANCE, CAN TOUCH OR BE TOUCHED.
Further, garments, when suspended upon a shore on which waves are broken, grow moist;
the same, when spread out in the sun, become dry;
yet neither has it been observed how the moisture of the water settled in them, nor, on the other hand, how it escaped under the influence of the heat.
The moisture, therefore, is dispersed into minute particles, which our eyes can by no means perceive.
Besides, in the course of many revolutions of the sun, 1 a ring upon the finger is made somewhat thinner by wearing it ;
the fall of the drop from the eaves hollows a stone;
the crooked share of the plough, though made of iron, impercep­ tibly decreases in the fields;
even the stone pavements of the streets we see worn by the feet of the multitude;
and the brazen statues, which stand near the gates, show their right hands made smaller by the touch of people frequently saluting them, and passing by.
These objects, therefore, after they have been worn, we observe to become diminished;
but what particles take their departure on each particular occasion, jealous nature has withheld from us the faculty of seeing.
2Lastly, whatever substances time and nature add little by little to objects, obliging them to increase gradually, those substances no acuteness of vision, however earnestly exerted, can perceive ;
nor, moreover, whatever substances waste away through age and decay ;
nor can you discern what the rocks, which overhang the sea, and are eaten by the corroding salt 3 of the ocean, lose every time that they are washed by the waves.
Nature, therefore, carries on her operations by imperceptible particles.
Nor, however,4 5 are all things held enclosed by corporeal substance ;
for there is a VOID in things;
a truth which it will be useful for you, in reference to many points, to know;
and which will prevent you from wandering in doubt, and from perpetually inquiring about the ENTIRE OF THINGS, and from being distrustful of my words.
Wherefore, I say, there is space INTANGIBLE, EMPTY, and VACANT.
If this were not the case, things could by no means be moved;
for that which is the quality of body, namely, to obstruct and to oppose, would be present at all times, and would be exerted against all bodies;
no­ thing, therefore, would be able to move forward, since nothing would begin to give way.
But now, throughout the sea and land and heights of heaven, we see many things moved before our eyes in various ways and by various means, which, if there were no void, would not so much want their active motion, as being deprived of it, as they would, properly speaking, never by any means have been produced at all ;
1 since matter, crowded together on all sides, would have remained at rest.
and have been unable to act.
Besides, although some things may be regarded as solid, yet you may, for the following reasons, perceive them to be of a porous consistence.
In rocks and caves, the liquid mois­ ture of the waters penetrates their substance, and all parts weep, as it were, with abundant drops ;
food distributes itself through the whole of the body in animals;
the groves in­ crease, and yield their fruits in their season, because nourish­ ment is diffused through the whole of the trees, even from the lowest roots, over all the trunks and branches;
voices pass through the walls, and fly across the closed apartments of houses;
keen frost2 penetrates to the very marrow of our bones;
which kind of effects, unless there were void spaces in bodies, where the several particles might pass, you would never by any means observe to take place.
Lastly, why do we see some things exceed other things in weight, though of no greater shape and bulk?
For, if there is just as much substance in a ball of wool as there is in a ball of lead, it is natural that they should weigh the same, since it is the property of all bodily substance to press every thing downwards;
but the nature of a VOID, on the contrary, continues without weight.
That body, therefore, which is equally large with another, and is evidently lighter, shows plainly that it contains a greater portion of VACUITY.
But the heavier body, on the other hand, indicates that there is in it more material substance, and that it comprises much less empty space.
That, therefore, which we are now, by the aid of searching argument, investigating, that, namely, which we call VOID;
is doubtless mixed among material substances.
In considering these matters, I am obliged to anticipate that objection which some imagine, lest it should seduce you from the truth.
They say, for instance, that water yields to fishes pushing forwards, and opens liquid passages, since the fish leave spaces behind them, into which the yielding waters may make a conflux;
so also that other things may be moved among themselves, and change their place, although all parts of space be full.
But this notion, it is evident, has been wholly conceived from false reasoning.
For in what direc­ tion, I pray, will fish be able to go forward, if the water shall not give them room ?
Or in what direction, moreover, will the water have power to yield, supposing the fish shall have no power to go forward to divide it ?
Either, therefore, we must deny motion to all bodies whatsoever, or we must admit that vacuity is more or less inherent in all material substances, whence every thing that moves derives the first commence­ ment of its motion.
Lastly, if two broad and flat bodies, after having come in­ to collision, suddenly start asunder, it is clear that air must necessarily take possession of all the vacuum which is then formed between the bodies.
And further, although that air may quickly unite to flow into the vacancy, with blasts blowing rapidly from all sides, yet the whole space will not be able to be filled at once;
for the air must of necessity occupy some part first, then another, till in succession all parts be occupied.
But if any person perchance, when the bodies have started asunder, thinks that that separation is thus effected by reason that the air condenses itself, he is in error;
for a vacuum is then formed between the bodies, which was not there before, and the part likewise behind the bodies, which was vacant be­ fore, is filled;
nor can air be condensed in such a way;
nor, even if it could, would it have the power, I think, to draw it­ self into itself,1 and unite its particles together without the aia of a void.
For which reason, although you may long hesitate, alleging many objections, you must nevertheless at last con­ fess that there is vacuum in bodies.
I have the ability, moreover, to collect credit for my doc­ trines, 1 by adducing many additional arguments.
But these small traces which I have indicated will be sufficient for a sa­ gacious mind;
traces by which, indeed, you yourself may dis­ cover others.
For as dogs, when they have once lighted upon certain tracks on the path, very frequently find by their scent the lair of a wild beast that ranges over the mountains, though covered over with leaves;
so you yourself will be able, in such matters as these, to note, of your own sagacity, one principle after another, and to penetrate every dark obscurity, and thence to elicit truth.
But if you shall be slow to assent, 0 Memmius, or if you shall at all shrink back from the subject, I can still certainly give you the following assurance.
My tongue, so agreeable to you, will have the power of pouring forth from my well­ stored breast such copious draughts 2 from mighty sources, that I fear lest slow old age may creep over our limbs, and break down the gates of life within us, before all the abundance of arguments in my verses, concerning any one subject, can have been poured into your ears.
But now, that I may re­ sume my efforts to complete in verse the weaving of the web which I have begun, give me a little more of your attention.
As it is, therefore, all nature of itself has consisted, and consists, of two parts;
"for there are bodily substances, and vacant space, in which these substances are situate, and in which they are moved in different directions.
For the com­ mon perception of all men shows that there is corporeal con­ sistence ;
1 of the existence of which, unless the belief shall be first firmly established, there will be no principle by reference to which we may succeed, by any means whatever, in settling the mind with argument concerning matters not obvious to sense.
To proceed then, if there were no place,2 and no space which we call vacant, bodies could not be situated any where, nor could at all move any whither in different directions ;
a fact which we have shown to you a little before.
Besides, there is nothing 3 which you can say is separate from all bodily substance, and distinct from empty space;
which would, indeed, be as it were a third kind of nature.
For whatsoever shall exist, must in itself be something, either of large bulk, or ever so diminutive, provided it be at all;
when, if it shall be sensible to the touch, however light and delicate, it will increase the number of bodies, and be ranked in the multitude of them;
but if it shall be intangible, inas­ much as it cannot hinder in any part any object proceeding to pass through it, it then, you may be sure, will be the empty space which we call a vacuum.
Moreover, whatsoever shall exist of itself, will either do something, or will be obliged TO SUFFER other things acting upon it, or will simply BE, so that other things may exist and be done in it.
But nothing can DO or SUFFER without being possessed of bodily substance, nor, moreover, afford place for acting and suffering, unless it be empty and vacant space.
No third nature, therefore, distinct in itself, besides vacant space and material substance, can possibly be left undiscovered in the sum of things;
no third kind of being, which can at any time fall under the notice of our senses, or which any one can find out by the exercise of his reason.
For whatsoever other things are said to be,1 you will find them to be either necessary ADJUNCTS of these two things, or accidents of them.
A necessary ADJUNCT is that which can never be separated and disjoined from its body without a dis­ union attended with destruction to that body;
as the weight of a stone, the heat of fire, the fluidity of water;
sensibility to touch in all bodies, insensibility to touch in empty space.
On the other hand, such things as slavery, poverty, riches, liberty, war, concord, and other things, by the coming or going of which the nature of the subject affected remains uninjured, these we are accustomed (as is proper) to call ACCIDENTS.
Time, likewise, is not an existence in itself, but it is merely our understanding that collects from things themselves what HAS BEEN DONE in the past age;
what also is PRESENT ;
what, moreover, MAY FOLLOW afterwards.
And it must be owned that no one has conceived of time existing by itself apart from progressive motion and quiet rest.
Moreover, when writers say that Helen WAS carried off, and that the Trojan people WERE subdued in war, we must take care lest, perchance, those writers induce us to admit that those events, viz.
the abduction of Helen and the subjugation of the Trojans, WERE of themselves;
when time, irrevocably past, has carried away those generations of men, of whom these transactions were the events or accidents.
For what­ ever shall have been done, will properly be called an event or accident, whether occurring to lands, or to legions1 (that is, men) themselves.
Furthermore, if there were not this bodily substance in things, nor this room and space in which all things severally are done, the flame lighted up by the love of Helen's beauty, spreading through the breast of the Phrygian Paris, would never have kindled the famous contests of cruel warfare;
nor would the wooden horse have secretly set fire to the citadel of the Trojans by a nocturnal delivery of Greeks.
So that you may plainly see that all transactions whatsoever do not CONSIST or EXIST of themselves, as body does, nor are spoken of as existing in the same way as a vacuum exists;
but rather that you may justly call them events or accidents of body, or of space in which all transactions are brought to pass.
Bodies, besides, are partly original elements 2 of things, and partly those which are formed of a combination of those ele­ ments.
But those which are elements of things, no force can break;
for they successfully resist all force by solidity of sub­ stance;
although, perhaps, it seems difficult to believe that any thing of so solid a substance can be found in nature;
for the lightning of heaven passes through the walls of houses, as also noise and voices pass;
iron glows, being penetrated by heat, in the fire;
rocks often burst with fervent heat;
the hardness of gold, losing its firmness, is dissolved by heat;
the icy coldness of brass, overcome by flame, melts;
heat, and penetrable cold, enter into the substance of silver, for we have felt both with the hand, when, as we held silver cups after our fashion,1 water was poured into them from above;
so that, as far as these instances go, there seems to be nothing solid in nature.
But because, however, right reason, and the nature of things, compel me to hold a contrary opinion, grant me your attention a while, until I make it plain, in a few verses, that there really exist such bodies as are of a solid and eternal corporeal substance;
which bodies we prove to be seeds and primary particles of things, of which the whole generated universe now consists.
In the first place, since a two-fold nature 2 of two things, a two-fold nature, or rather two natures extremely dissimilar, has been found to exist, namely, matter, and space in which every thing is done, it must necessarily be that each exists by itself for itself, independently of the other, and pure from ad­ mixture;
for wheresoever there is empty space, which we call a vacuum, there there is no matter, and, likewise, wheresoever matter maintains itself, there by no means exists empty space.
Original substances are therefore solid and without vacuity.
Furthermore, since in things which are produced,3 or com- pounded of matter, there is found empty space, solid matter must exist around it;
nor can any thing be proved by just argu­ ment to conceal vacuity, and to contain it within its body, unless you admit that that which contains it is a solid.
But that solid can be nothing but a combination of matter, such as may have the power of keeping a vacuity enclosed.
That matter, therefore, which consists of solid body, may be eternal, while other substances, which are only compounds of this mat­ ter, may be dissolved.
In addition, too,1 if there were no space to be vacant and unoccupied, all space would be solid.
On the other hand, unless there were certain bodies to fill up completely the places which they occupy, all space, which any where exists, would be an empty void.
Body, therefore, is evidently distinct from empty space, though each has its place alternately;
since all space neither exists entirely full, nor, again, entirely empty.
There exist, therefore, certain bodies which can completely fill the places which they occupy, and distinguish empty space from full.
These bodies, which thus completely fill space, can neither be broken2 in pieces by being struck with blows externally, nor, again, can be decomposed by being penetrated internally;
nor can they be made to yield if attempted by any other method;
a principle which we have demonstrated to you a little above;
for neither does it seem possible for any thing to be dashed in pieces without a vacuum, nor to be broken, nor to be divided into two by cutting ;
nor to admit moisture, nor, moreover, subtle cold, nor penetrating fire, by which operations and means all things compounded are dissolved.
And the more any thing contains empty space within it, the more it yields when thoroughly tried by these means.
If, therefore, the primary atoms are solid and without void, they must of neces­ sity be eternal.
Again, unless there had been eternal matter, 1 all things, before this time, would have been utterly reduced to nothing ;
and whatsoever objects we behold would have been reproduced from nothing.
But since I have shown above, that nothing can be produced from nothing, and that that which has been produced cannot be resolved into nothing, the primary elements must be of an imperishable substance, into which primary elements every body may be dissolved, so that matter may be supplied for the reproduction of things.
The pri­ mordial elements, therefore, are of pure solidity;
nor could they otherwise, preserved, as they have been, for ages, re­ pair things, as they have done, through that infinite space of time which has elapsed since the commencement of this material system.
Besides, if nature had set no limit2 to the destruction of things, the particles of matter would, by this time, have been so reduced, by reason of every former age wasting them, that no body compounded of them could, from any certain time, however remote, reach full maturity of existence.
For we see that any thing may be sooner taken to pieces than put together again;
for which reason, that which the infinitely long duration of all past time had broken into parts, disturb­ ing and dissevering it, could never be repaired in time to come.
But now, as is evident, there remains appointed a cer­ tain limit to destruction, since we see every thing recruited, and stated portions of time assigned to every thing according to its kind, in which it may be able to attain full vigour of age.
To this is added,1 that though the primary particles of mat­ ter are perfectly solid, yet that all things, which are formed of them, may be rendered soft and yielding, as air, water, earth, fire (in whatever way they may be produced, and by what­ ever influence they may be directed);
but this happens be­ cause there is vacant space intermingled with the substance of things compounded.
But, on the other hand, if the primordial elements of things were soft, how strong flints and iron could be produced, no explanation could be given, for, by this supposition, nature will be deprived of all possibility of com­ mencing a foundation.
The primordial elements, therefore, are endowed with pure solidity;
by the dense combination of which all compound bodies may be closely compacted, and exhibit powerful strength.
Moreover, if you still persist2 to say that no limit has been appointed to the dissolution of bodies, you will then, however, have to allow that there must remain certain dissoluble bodies in the world, which have not yet been assailed with any trial of their strength.
But since dissoluble bodies are endued only with a fragile nature, it is inconsistent to suppose that they could have lasted through an infinite course of time, if they had been harassed, age after age, with innumerable assaults.
Further, since also a limit3 has been assigned for the growth of things according to their kinds, and for their support of life;
and since it is established by the laws of Nature what each kind can or cannot do;
and since nothing is changed, but all things remain constant to such a degree, that even the birds of different plumage, all in succession, show, existing upon their bodies, spots distinctive of their species;
we must grant that such bodies must have in them1 an immutable ma­ terial substance.
For if the primitive particles of things could be changed, by being successfully wrought upon in any way, it would then also become uncertain what might or might not arise into being;
it would be uncertain, moreover, how far limited power, and a firmly fixed boundary, is set to each kind;
nor, with such a possibility of alteration, would the tribes of animals, according to their kinds, be so constantly able to re­ produce the nature, motions, mode of life, and habits of their progenitors.
Again, since even of such a body as our senses cannot per­ ceive,2 there is yet a certain extreme point, whatever it be, that point certainly exists without parts, and consists of the least possible natural substance ;
nor has it ever existed of it­ self, apart from its body, nor will it hereafter be able so to exist, since it is itself the first and last part 3 of another body ;
after which other and other like parts in succession fill up, in a condensed mass, the substance of the body, which parts, since they cannot consist by themselves, must of necessity adhere to something else, from which they can by no means be detached.
Primordial atoms are therefore of pure solidity, which, composed of the smallest points, closely cohere;
not combined of a union of any other things, but rather endowed with an eternal, simple, and indissoluble existence, from which nature allows nothing to be broken off, or even diminished, reserving these primordial atoms as seeds for her productions.
Moreover, unless there shall be some LEAST,' some point where division ends, the smallest bodies will individually con­ sist of infinite parts, as, in that case, any part of the half of any body1 will always have its own half;
nor will any thing set a limit to this division.
What, therefore, will be the dif­ ference in their nature between the greatest and smallest of bodies ?
2
It will not be possible that there should be any difference;
for though the whole entire sum of things,3 or the Universe, be infinite, yet the smallest things which exist in it will equally consist of infinite parts.
To which position since just reasoning is opposed, and denies that the mind can ad­ mit it, you must be prevailed upon to acknowledge that there are bodies which exist having no parts,4 and consist of the least possible substance;
and since they are so, since they are indivisible and undiminishable, you must also concede that they are solid and eternal.
Further, unless Nature, the producer of things, had been accustomed to force all things to be resolved into minutest parts, the same Nature would now be unable to recruit any thing from those parts;
because those generated bodies which are augmented and repaired by no parts, 1 cannot have and re­ tain unimpaired those affections which generative matter ought to have, namely, various connexions, weights, concussions, combinations, movements, by which things are severally brought to pass.
For which reason, those who think that fire2 is the original principle of things, and that the universe is maintained from fire alone, seem to have greatly erred from true reason.
Of which philosophers Heraclitus, as leader, first comes to the battle ;
a writer celebrated for the obscurity of his language, though rather among the vain and empty, than among the sensible Greeks, who seek for truth.
For fools rather ad­ mire and delight in all things which they see hid under in­ versions and intricacies of words, and consider those assertions to be truths which have power to touch the ear agreeably, and which are disguised with pleasantness of sound.
For how, I ask, could things be so various, if they were produced from fire alone and pure from mixture ?
Since it would be to no purpose that hot fire should be condensed or rarefied, if the parts of fire retained the same nature which the whole of fire still has.
1
For though there might be a fiercer heat in the condensed parts, and a more languid warmth in the separated and dispersed, there is nothing more than this which you can conceive possible to be effected in or by .
such causes;
much less can so vast a variety of things originate from dense and rare fire.
And this also is to be borne in mind, that if they admit vacuity to be mixed with things, fire will then have the capability to be condensed, or left rare­ fied ;
but because they see that, in this admission of vacuity, there are many things adverse to them and their doctrines, and therefore shrink from admitting a pure vacuum to exist among substances, they thus, while they fear difficulties, lose the true path, nor observe that, on the other hand, all vacuity being removed from substances,2 all things would be condensed, and one body would be formed from all, which body could eject nothing from itself, as glowing fire emits light and heat, in such a manner that you may see it does not consist of con­ densed parts.
But if they think that fire may by any means be extinguished in close condensation, and change its natural consistence, and if, indeed, they shall not hesitate to allow that this may take place absolutely,1 then all heat, it is evident, will fall utterly to nothing, and whatever things are re-produced, supposing all to have been producedfromfire, will be made out of no­ thing.
For whatever, being changed, departs from its own limits,2 this change in it is straightway the death or termin­ ation of that which it was before.
Something, therefore, supposing we admit their doctrine, must necessarily remain un­ changed in that fire of theirs, that all things, as you may see, may not utterly fall to nothing,3 and that the multitude of objects in the universe may not have-to-flourish by being reproduced from nothing.
And now, therefore, since there are certain most con­ stant elements, which always retain the same nature, by the departure and accession of which, and by their change of order, things alter their nature, and compound bodies con­ vert themselves into a different consistence, it is easy to under­ stand that these elements of things are not fiery.
For it would be to no purpose that some of these elements should detach themselves and depart from one place, and be as­ signed to another, and that some should have their order changed, if they all still retained the nature of fire, for whatever fire might produce would be in all forms only fire.
But, as I am of opinion, the truth stands thus:
There are certain elementary bodies, whose combinations, movements, order, position, shapes, produce fire, and which, when their order is changed, change their nature as a compound;
nor, as I think, are they in themselves like to fire, or to any other thing, which has the power of emitting particles to our senses, and affecting our touch by its application.
To say, moreover, that all things are fire, and that no real substance exists in the whole number of things but fire, (an assertion which this philosopher makes,) seems to be in the highest degree absurd.
Since he himself, while arguing from his senses, combats against his senses,1and shakes the credit of those perceptions, on which all things that we believe de­ pend, and by the aid of which that which he names fire is known to him.
For he believes that his senses distinguish fire accurately;
other things, which are not at all less clear, he does not believe that they can distinguish;
an inconsistency which seems to me both folly and madness.
For to what shall we refer for information ?
What can be a more certain criterion to us than the senses themselves ?
How, if we cease to trust them, can we distinguish what is true, and what is false ?
Besides, why should any one rather set aside all other things, and desire to admit the substance of fire as the only substance, than deny that fire exists, and still allow existence to all other substances ?
2 For to advance either assertion, seems equal madness.
Wherefore, those who have thought that FIRE is the pri­ mary matter of things, and that the whole universe may originate from fire;
and those who have determined that AIR is the first principle1 for the production of things;
those who have imagined that WATER can itself form things of itself;
and those who have supposed that the EARTH produces all things, and is changed into all substances of things, appear all to have wandered extremely far from the truth.
To these add also those philosophers who couple the ele­ ments of things,2 uniting Air with Fire, and Earth with Wa­ ter ;
and who think that from these four things, namely, from fire, earth, and air, and moisture, all bodies may proceed.
Among the chief of whom is Empedocles3 of Agrigentum, whom, within the triangular coasts of its land, that island produced, around which the Ionian deep flowing with vast windings,4 sprinkles on it salt5 from its blue waves, and the sea, rolling rapidly in a narrow channel, divides with its waves the shores of the lands of Æolia,(i. e. Italy,)6 from the boundaries of it (viz. of Sicily).
Here is the vast Charybdis, and here the murmurs of AEtna threaten, indicating that the mountain is again gathering its wrathful flames, that its vio­ lence may vomit forth afresh the fires bursting from its jaws, and once more hurl to the sky its blazing lightnings ;
which great region, though it seems worthy-of-admiration to the human race on many accounts, and is extolled as deserving­ of-being-visited, being rich in valuable productions, and de­ fended with a mighty force of inhabitants, yet appears to have contained in it nothing more excellent than this man, nor any thing more sacred, and wonderful, and estimable..
The verses, moreover, which proceeded from his divine intel­ ect, proclaim and expound his noble discoveries so eloquently, that he scarcely seems to have been sprung from a human origin.
He, however, and those whom I mentioned above, (men distinguishably below him by many degrees, and far in­ ferior to him,) although, finding out many things excellently and divinely, they gave oracles, as it were, from the inmost- temple of their heart, more sacredly, and with much more true reason, than the Pythia who speaks from the tripod and laurel of Phœbus, yet stumbled2 in attempting to expound the principles of things, and, great as they were, fell there with a heavy downfal.
In the first place they erred, because they settle that motion may take place, though all vacuum be ex­ cluded from matter, and because they admit that there exist soft and subtle bodies, (air, sun, fire, earth, animals, vegetable productions,) and yet mingle no vacuity in their composition.
Secondly, they erred, because they assert that there is no limit at all to the division of material-particles, and that no bound is set to their fracture;
nor do they at all allow that any LEAST exists in bodies, although we see that there is that least, namely, the extreme point of every body, which seems to be least to our senses;
so that you may hence conclude that there exists in bodies a least possible quantity, which you yourself cannot perceive, but which, nevertheless, they have as an extreme.
To this is also added, that they make the elements of things to be soft bodies, which soft bodies we see to be generated, and altogether of a perishable consistence.
But if the elements of things were soft and perishable, the whole universe must fall back to nothing,1 and the abundance of things flourish by being re-produced from nothing.
But how far each of these suppositions is distant from the truth, you have already had proof.
Besides, these four elements are in many ways hostile2 and destructive to one another;
for which reason, on coming to­ gether, they will either be naturally destroyed, or will start away from one another, as we see, when a tempest has arisen, the lightnings, and rains, and winds, not congregating together, but scattering themselves abroad.
Moreover, if all things'are produced from those four bodies,3 and all things are again dissolved into those bodies, how can those four be more justly called the primary elements of things, than, on the other hand, things may be called the pri­ mary elements of them, and a backward computation, as it were, be made?
For, according to this hypothesis, they are produced alternately, and change their appearance, and their whole substance among themselves, perpetually.
But if perchance you imagine that the substances of fire and earth, and ethereal air and the liquid of water, meet together in such a way that by their combination they make no change in their nature, nothing will be produced for you from them, neither animated creature, nor any thing of inanimate sub­ stance, as a tree;
for each element in the conflux of the vary­ ing heap will exhibit only its own nature, and air will be seen to remain mixed together with earth and with some portion of liquid ;
1 but primary elements, for the production of things, must exercise a latent and unapparent influence, lest any element arise above the rest, which may resist their action, and prevent whatsoever is being formed from being able to attain its proper character.
These philosophers, moreover, take a beginning from heaven and its fires, and make fire first to change itself into the air of the sky;
from air they say that water is produced, and that earth is generated from water;
and then they say again that all things return back from earth, first water, afterwards air, then heat;
and that these elements do not cease to interchange, and to pass from heaven to earth, and from earth to the stars of heaven;
which primary elements ought by no means to do.
For it is necessary that there should remain something unchangeable, lest all things should be reduced utterly to nothing.
Since whatsoever, being changed, goes beyond its own limits, this change becomes forthwith the death or ter­ mination of that which it was before.
Wherefore, since these four bodies which we have previously mentioned, pass into changer they must necessarily consist of other elements which cannot be changed in any way, lest all things should return, as you may suppose, utterly to nothing.
But you may rather con- clude that certain bodies exist, endowed with such a nature, that if perchance they have generated fire, the same bodies may, a few particles being taken away and a few being added.
and their order and motion being changed, produce the air of heaven;
and that, in like manner, all other bodies may be changed into other bodies.
But manifest fact, you perhaps observe, evidently shows that all things grow, and are nourished upwards, from the earth into the air of heaven ;
and, unless the season is indul­ gent with favourable weather, unless the groves are shaken with rains and with the moisture of showers,2 and, you will add, unless the sun, for his part, cherishes the productions of nature and affords heat, corn, trees, and animals would not be able to grow.
Doubtless;
and unless solid food and soft liquid were to sustain ourselves, our bodies, for want of them, being quickly exhausted, all life also would waste away from our nerves and bones;
for we are without all question supported and nourished by certain substances, and other and other things are nourished by certain substances;
because, as is evident, many common elements of many things3 are mixed in many bodies in many ways;
therefore various things are sustained by various things.
And it is often of great conse - quence with what other elements, and in what position, these same elements are combined, and what motions they recipro­ cally cause and suffer.
For the same elements constitute the heaven, the sea, the earth, the rivers, the sun;
the same ele­ ments constitute corn, woods, animals.
But they are actuated and made effective by being mixed with other different ele­ ments and in different ways.
Besides, even in my own verses you see every where many elements common to many words;
although you must never­ theless allow that the verses and words differ one from an­ other both in sense and sound;
so much can elements effect, even if their order only be changed !
But those elements which are the principles of things, being more numerous, can attract to themselves more, andform more combinations, from which all the various things in the universe may severally be produced.
And now let us also examine the ‛Ομοιομέρεια of Anax­ agoras,2 as the Greeks call it;
nor does the poverty of our na­ tive tongue, indeed, allow us to name it in our own language.
But it is easy, however, to explain in words the thing itself, which, as the origin of things, he calls ‛Ομοιομέρια.
He thinks, that is to say, that bones are produced from small and minute bones;
so likewise that flesh is generated from small and minute particles of flesh,3 and that blood is formed from many drops of blood meeting together\ he is of opinion, moreover, that gold may consist of crumbs of gold, and that earth may be a concrete of little earths ;
that fire may be from fires, and moisture from moistures.
Other things he ima­ gines and supposes to be produced in a similar way.
Yet he does not allow that there is any where a void in things, or that there is any limit to the division of bodies.
Wherefore in both these respects he seems to me to err equally with those of whom we have before spoken.
Add to this, that he supposes principles which are too frail, if, indeed, they are principles which are made to be endowed with like nature as the things themselves that are produced from them, and equally suffer and decay;
nor does any thing withhold them from destruction.
For what portion of them will endure under violent oppression, so as to escape dissolu­ tion under the very teeth of death ?
Will it be fire, or moisture, or air ?
which of these ?
Or will it be blood, or bone ?
Not one of all those substances, as I conceive;
since every thing uni­ versally will be equally perishable as those things which we see manifestly perish from before our eyes, when overcome by any violence.
But I call to witness the positions which I have before proved, that neither can things be reduced to no­ thing, nor again grow up from nothing.
Moreover, since food augments and nourishes the body, we may understand that veins, and blood, and bones, and nerves, consist of heterogeneous parts.
Or, if these philosophers shall say that all food is of a mixed substance, and contains in itself small elements of nerves and bones, and also veins and par­ ticles of blood, it will follow, that both all solid food, and liquid itself, must be thought to consist of such heterogeneous matters, and to be mixed up of bones, and nerves, and veins, and blood.
Besides, if whatever bodies grow from the earth are previously latent in the earth, earth must consist of all those heterogeneous matters which spring from earth.
Transfer this reasoning to other objects, and you may likewise use the same phraseology:
in wood, for instance, if there is concealed flame, and smoke, and ashes, wood must necessarily consist of the heterogeneous particles of those substances.
Here some slight opportunity is left to this sect of philoso­ phers for eluding the arguments of their adversaries;
an oppor­ tunity of which Anaxagoras avails himself, by alleging that although he thinks all things lie-secretly mixed with all things, yet that that alone appears on the surface of each, of which there are most particles mixed in the composition of each, and placed more as it were in readiness and in front;
which, however, is far removed from just reasoning.
For, if this hypothesis were correct, it might-naturally-be-expected also that corn, when it is broken by the overwhelming force of the mill-stone,1 would exhibit some token of bloody or some­ thing of those substances which are nourished in our bodies;
(that when we rub stone against stone, blood should flow;
) in like manner, also, it would be probable that herbs would send forth drops of a sweet liquid, and of similar taste, such as are the drops of milk, that issue from the udder of the sheep.
And, without doubt, we might also suppose that fre­ quently, when clods of earth are broken, rudiments of the several kinds of herbs, and corn, and leaves of trees would ap­ pear scattered about, and be proved to lie hid in the earth in minute particles ;
moreover that in wood, when it is broken, ashes, and smoke, and small particles of fire would be found to lie concealed.
Of which occurrences, since manifest expe­ rience shows that none take place, we may understand that substances are not so mixed with substances;
but, if Anax­ agoras were right, the common seeds of many things must lie secretly mixed, in many ways, among other things.
But, you will say, it often happens that on the high moun­ tains, the extreme tops of tall trees, when near to one another, are rubbed together, the strong south winds compelling them to act thus, until they shine with a flash of flame bursting forth.
It is so.
And yet the fire is not inherent in the wood, but there are in it many seeds of heat, which, when they have become confluent by friction, produce a conflagration in the woods.
But if positive flame1 were hidden in the woods, the fire could not be concealed for any length of time, but would openly consume the forests, and burn up the groves.
Do you now see, therefore, (what we remarked a little be­ fore,) that it is frequently of great consequence with what other elements and in what position the same elements are combined, and what motions they reciprocally impart and re­ ceive ?
And that the same elements a little altered2 in respect to each other, produce fire from wood, ignes è lignis, just as also the words themselves consist of elements or letters a lit­ tle changed, when we denote wood and fire, ligna atque ignes, by distinct appellations.
Finally, if you think that whatever things you see in the visible world, could not be conceived to have been formed without supposing the primary particles of matter to be en­ dowed with a nature similar to the things formed from them, your original elements of things, by this hypothesis, become mere absurdities, and fall to the ground.
1
For the consequence of such a supposition will be, that you must have primary particles which, as the origin of laughter, are themselves con­ vulsed with tremulous fits of laughter, and others which, as the originals of weeping, bedew their own faces and cheeks with salt tears.
And now give me your attention as to what remains;
learn and hear more fully and plainly.
Nor does it escape my knowledge how obscure these matters are;
but the great hope of praise has struck my heart with her powerful thyrsus, and has at the same time infused into my breast a pleasing love of the Muses, with which inspired I now wander, in vigorous thought, over the trackless regions of the Pierides, trodden before by the foot of no poet.
It delights me to ap­ proach the untasted fountains, and to drink;
and it transports me to pluck the fresh flowers, and to obtain a distinguished chaplet for my head from those groves whence the Muses have hitherto veiled the temples of no one.
In the first place, be­ cause I give instruction concerning mighty subjects, and pro­ ceed to free the mind from the closely-confining shackles of Religion ;
in the next place, because I compose such lucid verses concerning so obscure a subject, touching every thing with the grace of poetry.
Since such ornament also seems not unjustifiable or without reason.
But as physicians, when they attempt to give bitter wormwood to children, first tinge the rim round the cup with the sweet and yellow liquid of honey, that the age of childhood, as yet unsuspicious,1 may find its lips deluded, and may in the mean time drink up the bitter juice of the wormwood, and, though deceived, may not be injured, but rather, recruited by such a process, may ac­ quire strength :
so now I, since this argument seems ge­ nerally too severe andforbidding to those by whom it has not been handled, and since the multitude shrink back from it, was desirous to set forth my chain-of-reasoning to thee, 0 Mem­ miuS, in sweetly-speaking Pierian verse, and, as it were, to tinge it with the honey of the Muses;
if perchance, by such a method, I might detain thy attention upon my strains, until thou lookest through the whole NATURE OF THINGS, and understandest with what shape and beauty it is adorned.
But since I have taught that atoms of matter, entirely solid, pass-to-and-fro perpetually, unwasted through all time ;
come now, and let us unravel whether there be any limit2 to their aggregate, or not;
also, let us look into that which has been found to be vacancy, or the room and space in which things severally are done, and learn whether the whole is entirely limited, or extends unbounded and unfathomably profound.
All that exists, therefore, I affirm,3 is bounded in no di­ rection ;
for, if it were bounded, it must have some extremity;
but it appears that there cannot be an extremity of any thing, unless there be something beyond, which may limit it;
so that there may appear to be some line farther than which4 this faculty of our sense (i. e. Cur vision) cannot extend.
Now, since it must be confessed that there is nothing beyond the WHOLE, the whole has no extremity;
nor does it matter at what part of it you stand,1 with a view to being distant from its boundary;
inasmuch as, whatever place any one occupies, he leaves the WHOLE just as much boundless in every direction.
Besides, if all space which is, be supposed to be bounded, and if any one should go forward as far as possible, even to what he thinks its extreme limits, and should throw, or attempt to throw, a flying dart,2 whether would you have that dart, hurled with vigorous strength, go on in the direction in which it may have been propelled, and fly far forwards, or do you rather prefer to think that something would have power to hinder and stop it ?
For one of the two alternatives you must of necessity admit and adopt;
of which alternatives either cuts off escape from you, and compels you to grant that the WHOLE extends without limit.
Since whether there is any thing to stop the javelin, and to cause that it may not go on in the direction in which it was aimed, and fix itself at the destined termination of its flight, or whether it is borne onwards be­ yond the supposed limit, it evidently did not begin-its-flight from a boundary of the WHOLE.
In this manner I will go on with you, and wheresoever you shall fix the extreme margin of space, I will ask you what then would be the case with the javelin.
The case will be, that a limit can no where exist;
and that room for the flight of the javelin will still extend its flight.
Further, if all the space of the entire WHOLE were shut-in and bounded on all sides by certain limits, the quantity of matter in the universe would before this time have flowed together to the bottom, by reason of its solid weight;
nor could any thing be carried on beneath the canopy of heaven;
nor, indeed, would there be a heaven at all, or light of the sun;
for all matter, from sinking down for an infinite space of time, would be accumulated at the bottom of the WHOLE.
But now, it is evident, no rest is given to the atoms of the primary-elements;
because no part of the universe is com­ pletely and fundamentally lowest, whither the atoms might, as it were, flow together, and where they might fix their seat;
and therefore all things are always carried on in all parts in perpetual motion, and the lowest atoms of matter, or those which we may conceive to be the lowest, stirred up from the infinite of space, are supplied for the generation of things.
Moreover, in things before our eyes, object seems to bound object;
the air sets-a-boundary-to the hills, and the hills to the air;
the land limits the sea, and the sea, on the other hand, limits the entire land;
but, as to the WHOLE, there is nothing beyond it that can bound it.
The nature, therefore, of space, and the extent of the profound whole, is such a vast, which neither famous rivers,1 in their course, can run through, though flowing for an eternal length of time, nor, by passing on, can at all cause that less distance should remain for them to go.
To such a degree, on every side, vast abundance of room lies open for all things, all limit being set aside every where and in every direction.
Besides,
Nature herself prevents the WHOLE OF THINGS from being able to provide bounds for itself, inasmuch as she compels body to be bounded by that which is vacuum, and that which is vacuum to be bounded by body;
that so, by this alternate bounding of one by the other, she may render ALL infinite.
1
Else, moreover, if one or other of these did not bound the other by its simple nature, so that one of them, the vacuum for instance, should extend unlimited, neither the sea, nor the land, nor the bright temples of heaven,2 nor the race of mortals, nor the sacred persons of the gods, could subsist for the small space of an hour.
For the body of matter, driven abroad from its union, would be borne dispersed through the mighty void, or rather, in such a case, never having been united, would never have produced any thing, since, when originally scattered, it could not have been brought together.
For certainly neither the primary elements of things dis­ posed themselves severally in their own order, by their own counsel or sagacious understanding;
nor, assuredly, did they agree among themselves what motions each should produce;
but because, being many, and changed in many ways, they are for an infinite space of time agitated, being acted upon by forces, throughout the WHOLE, they thus, by experiencing movements and combinations of every kind, at length settle into such positions, by which means, (i. e. positions,)1 this SUM of things, being produced, exists.
And this sum of things, when it was once thrown into suitable motions, being also maintained in that state through many long years, causes that the rivers recruit the greedy sea with large floods of water, and that the earth, cherished by the heat of the sun, renews its productions;
also that the race of living creatures flour­ ishes undecayed,2 and that the gliding fires of heaven live.
Which effects atoms could by no means produce, unless an abundant supply of matter could arise from the infinite of space, whence every thing that is produced is accustomed to repair in time the parts lost.
For as the nature of animals, when deprived of food, wastes and decays, losing its substance, so must all things fall away, as soon as matter, turned by any means from its course,3 has failed to supply itself.
Nor can impacts,4 as some may imagine, produced externally on all sides, keep together the entire WHOLE, or whatever of matter has been combined into a whole.
For though some external impacts may strike frequently, and thus may sustain here and there a part, until others succeed, and the requisite number of impacts for securing any particular portion may be completed;
yet at times the bodies producing the impacts are compelled to rebound, and at the same moment to give the pri­ mary-atoms of things space and time for flight, so that they may be carried away free from the aggregate.
It is neces­ sary therefore for such compression by impact, that many atoms should again and again rise up into actionfrom the surrounding parts ;
and besides, in order that the impacts may be given in sufficient numbers, an infinite quantity of matter is requisite on every side.
And in these matters, 0 Memmius, be very far from be lieving that which some say, namely, that all things tend to the centre1 of the WHOLE, and that therefore the nature and substance of the world stand without any percussions or pr es­ sures from without, and that the highest and lowest parts, as we call them, cannot be resolved, or thrown back in any direc­ tion, because all things strive towards the middle;
(if, indeed, you DO believe that any thing, as the earth, according to them, can rest upon itself in the middle;
and that those heavy bodies which are on the lower part of the earth, all tend upwards, or to the centre, and rest upon the earth, although placed in a re­ verse position to ourselves, like the shadows of things which we every day see in the water, with their lower parts uppermost.)
And in like manner they contend that the animals beneath us range about with their feet upwards, nor can fall back from the earth into the lower parts of heaven, more than our bodies can spontaneously fly off into the upper parts of heaven;
that when they see the sun, we behold the stars of night, and that they share the times of heaven, the hours of light and darkness, alternately with us, and pass nights corresponding in time to our days.
But a vain delusion must have devised all these things for foolish men, mistaken in that they have embraced a wrong opinion at the commencement.
For there can be no middle where vacuum and space are infinite;
nor, even if there were a middle, would any thing at all rest there more on that account, than it would stay there for any other far different reason.
Since all mere place, and space which we call empty, must, whether through the centre or through what is not the centre, yield equally a passage to equal weights, in whatsoever direc- tion their motions tend.
Nor is there any place, at which when bodies have arrived, they can make a stand in vacuo, having lost the force of weight;
-nor again, must that which is vacuum, give support beneath any thing, but must proceed to yield that passage through it which its nature requires.
Things, therefore, cannot be held in combination under such a hypothesis, namely, that they are influenced by a tendency to the centre.
This sect of philosophers are in error, moreover, inasmuch as they do not suppose that ALL particles tend to the centre, but only those of earth and water, as the liquid of the sea and the great floods from the mountains, and those which are contained, as it were, in earthy substances;
but set forth, on the other hand, that the subtle air of heaven, and warm fire, are at the same time carried away from the centre, and that, from this cause, the whole sky twinkles around us with stars, and the flame of the sun is fed throughout the blue expanse of heaven, since all the heat, fleeing from the centre, collects in those parts:
(for the generations of men also, they say, are fed from the earth, by food rising from the centre ;
nor could the extremities of the branches of the trees produce leaves, if the earth did not gradually supply sustenance to each from the ground;
) while they add, that the heaven above covers all things round about, lest the walls of the world, being dissolved into their constituent atoms, should suddenly fly,1 like winged flames, through the vast void, and lest other things should follow in like manner ;
lest, moreover, the regions of heaven, containing the thunder, should fall from above, and the earth should hastily withdraw itself from un­ der our feet, and all human beings, dissolving their bodies into their elements, should pass away, in the midst of the mingled ruin of things of earth and heaven, through the deep INANE, so that, in a moment of time, no relic should exist of them, except desert space and blind atoms.
1
For wheresoever you shall suppose atoms to be first absent from their proper place, that part will be the gate of death to all things;
oy that part, the whole crowd of material-elements will rush forth abroad.
These things if you shall understand, led on by my humble effort, (for one proposition will appear plain from another,) dark night will not prevent your progress, or hinder you from seeing clearly into the last depths of nature;
so effectually will truths kindle light for truths.
Having exhorted Memmius to the study of philosophy, vert 1—60, Lucre­ tius proceeds to treat of the properties of atoms, of which the first it motion, which they owe either to their own weight or the impulse of other atoms, ver. 60—87.
Atoms are borne downwards, as being heavy, and when solid atoms come in collision, they must necessarily rebound;
some unite with others;
those that unite closely, form bodies hard and dense;
those that combine more loosely, thin and subtle substances, ver. 88—107.
Some do not coalesce, but wander continually through space, impelling and agitating other atoms, ver. 108—140.
The swiftness of atoms, ver. 141—166.
He attacks those who deny the Epicurean doctrine of atoms, and refuse to admit that this unchangeable order of things is maintained without a divine providence, ver. 167—183.
Atoms in their course down­ wards decline a little from the right line, 184—221.
Were they not to decline, nothing would be produced, and there could be no free agency in animals when produced, vert 222—271.
Atoms are still borne on in the same way in which they have moved from all eternity;
nor is this assertion to be disputed because all things seem at rest, ver. 272—332.
The second remarkable property of atoms is figure;
how greatly they differ in this is shown by the vast variety of things produced from them, ver. 332—425.
Some atoms are rough and jagged, others smooth and round;
some produce bitter and some sweet, some hard and some soft bodies, vert 426—476.
But the figures of atoms are not infinite, though the number of each figure is infinite, ver. 477—580.
Shows that com­ pound bodies contain atoms of different figures, and alludes to the natural history of the earth, and the fabulous history of Cybele, ver. 580—728.
Atoms have not those qualities which we call sensible qualities, as colour, taste, heat, cold, &c., though they generate bodies having those qualities, ver. 729—1021.
The infinite number of atoms, moving through the in­ finite of space, compose infinite worlds, which are sometimes increased by atoms being added, and sometimes diminished and dissolved by the separ­ ation and departure of atoms, ver. 1022—1149;
just as, before our eyes, plants and animals grow up, decline, and perish, ver. 1150—1172.
IT is sweet, when the winds1 disturb the waters on the vast deep, to behold from the land the great distress of another;
not because it is a joyous pleasure that any one should be-made­ to-suffer, but because it is agreeable to see from what evils thou thyself art free.
It is also sweet to contemplate the contending-forces of war, arrayed over the plains, without any share of thy own in the danger.
But nothing is sweeter than to occupy the well-defended serene heights raised by the learning of the wise,2 from whence thou mayest look down upon others, and see them straying in all directions, wander­ ing about to find the best path of life;
contending in intellec­ tual power, vying with each other in nobleness of birth, and striving by excessive labour, night and day, to rise to the highest power, and to obtain the government of affairs.
O wretched minds of men !
0 blind souls!
In what darkness of life, and in how great dangers, is this existence, of whatever duration it is, passed!
May we not see that the nature of every man demands3 nothing more for itself, but that he, from whose body pain is removed and absent, may exercise his mind with a pleasurable feeling, exempt from care and fear ?
We are sensible, therefore, that very few things are neces- sary to the nature of the body;
those things, namely, which are of such a kind that they may keep off pain, and that they may afford, at the same time, many pleasures;
nor does na­ ture herself ever require1 higher gratification.
If there are not, in the houses of men, golden images of youths, holding in their right hands blazing lamps, in order that light may be supplied for the nocturnal feast;
and if their dwelling nei­ ther gleams with silver nor glitters with gold, nor harps cause the arched and gilded roofs to resound;
2 nevertheless, when they have stretched themselves upon the soft grass, near a stream of water, under the boughs of a high tree, they socially, though with no great wealth, gratify their senses with plea­ sure, especially when the weather smiles upon them, and the seasons of the year sprinkle the green grass with flowers.
Nor do hot fevers sooner depart from the body, if you are tossed on woven figures and blushing purple, than if you are obliged to lie under a plebeian covering.
For which reason, since neither riches, nor nobility, nor the glory of a kingdom, are of any profit as to our body, we must further suppose that they are of no profit to the mind:
3 unless, perchance, when you see your legions4 moving with energy over the surface of the plain, stirring up the images of war, or when you see your fleet sailing-with-animation, and spreading far abroad upon the water, religious-fears, alarmed at these things, flee affrighted from your mind, and the dread of death then leaves your time undisturbed5 and free from care.
But if we see that such suppositions and expectations are ridi­ culous and merely objects of derision, and that in reality the fears and pursuing cares of men dread neither the sound of arms nor cruel weapons, and mingle boldly among kings and rulers of affairs, nor shrink before the brightness gleaming from gold, or the shining splendour of a purple garment, why do you doubt but that to produce these effects is wholly the office of reason,1 especially when all our life labours under the darkness of ignorance ?
For as children tremble 2 and fear every thing in thick darkness, so we, in the light, fear some­ times things which are not more to be feared than those which children dread, and imagine about to happen, in the dark.
This terror of the mind, therefore, it is not the rays of the sun or the bright arrows of day that must dis­ pel, but the contemplation of nature, and the exercise of reason.
Attend now, therefore, and I will explain to thee by what motions 3 the generative bodies of matter produce various things, and resolve them when produced;
and by what force they are thus compelled to act, and what activity has been com­ municated to them for passing through the mighty void of space.
Do thou remember to give thyself wholly to my words.
For, assuredly, matter does not constantly cohere as being closely condensed in itself, since we see every object dimin­ ished, and perceive that all things flow away, as it were, through length of time, and that age withdraws them from our eyes;
while, nevertheless, the sum of all seems to remain un­ decayed.
And this happens for this reason, that the particles of matter which depart from each object, lessen the object from which they depart, and endow with increase the object or objects to which they have transferred themselves;
and oblige the former to decay, but the latter, on the contrary, to flourish.
Nor do they continue always in the place to which they have gone;
and thus the sum of things is perpetually renewed, and the races of mortal men subsist by change and transference from one to the other.
Some nations increase, others are di­ minished, and, in a short space of time, the tribes of living creatures are changed by successive generations, and, like the racers, deliver the torch 1 of life from hand to hand.
If you think that the elemental-atoms of things can remain at rest, and can, by remaining at rest, generate fresh motions of things, you stray with a wide deviation from true reason.
For, since the primary-particles of all things wander through the void of space, they must necessarily be all carried forwards by their own gravity, or, as it may chance, by the force of another body;
for when, being often moved, they, meeting, have struck against one another, it happens that they suddenly start asunder in different directions;
since neither is it to be wondered at that bodies should do so, which are of the ut­ most hardness, and of solid weight;
nor, it is to be observed, does any thing behind oppose their motion.
2
And that you may the more clearly understand that all the atoms of matter are tossed about and kept in motion, remember that in the sum of the whole, or in the entire universe, there is no lowest place;
nor has it any point where the primary atoms may make a stand ;
since space is without bound and limit, and shows ofitself, by many indications, that it extends around in­ finite in every direction.
And this has been proved by indis­ putable argument.
1Which immensity of space being admitted, there was evi­ dently allowed no rest to the primary atoms passing through the void profound;
but rather, driven by perpetual and con­ stant motion, part, when struck by other atoms, rebound to a great distance, and part also, when struck, rebounding only to short distances, are caught and intertwined, as it were, by the stroke of the particles that come in contact with them.
And whatsoever particles being brought together in a more close congeries, rebound only to small distances, as being involved by their own entangling shapes, these form the strong sub­ stance of rock, and the rigid consistence of iron, and a few other things of their kind, and of similar hardness.
Other particles again, which wander through the vast void of space, fly, when struck, far off, and rebound away to great distances;
these supply to us the thin air and radiant light of the sun.
And many atoms besides wander through the great void, which are rejected by combinations of bodies, and have no where been able, admitted into union, to associate their motions with other atoms.
Of which circumstance, as I conceive,2 an example and image is, from time to time, moving and present before our eyes.
For, behold, whensoever the beams of the sun pour themselves through a chink into the dark parts of houses, you will see, in the light of the rays, many minute particles throughout the open space, mingled together in many ways, and, as it were, in perpetual conflict, exhibiting battles and fights, contending in companies, nor allowing any pause to their strife, being agitated by frequent concussions and se­ parations ;
so that you may conjecture, from this spectacle, what it is for the primary-particles of things to be perpetually tossed about in the great void.
Assuredly a small thing may give an example, and traces leading to the knowledge of great things.
On this account it is more fitting that you should give your attention to these motes which seem to confuse one an­ other in the rays of the sun ;
because such disorders signify that there secretly-exist tendencies to motion also in the principles of matter, though latent and unapparent to our senses.
For you will see there, among those atoms is the sun-beam, many, struck with imperceptible forces, change their course, and turn back, being repelled sometimes this way, and sometimes that, every where, and in all directions.
And doubtless this er­ rant-motion 1 in all these atoms proceeds from the primary elements of matter;
for the first primordial-atoms of things are moved of themselves ;
and then those bodies which are of light texture, and are, as it were, nearest to the na­ ture of the primary elements, being urged by secret im­ pulses of those elements, are put into motion, and these lat­ ter themselves, moreover, agitate others which are somewhat larger.
Thus motion ascends from the first principles, and spreads forth by degrees, so as to be apparent to our senses, and so that those atoms are moved before us, which we can see in the light of the sun;
though it is not clearly evident by what impulses they are thus moved.
And now, 0 Memmius, what activity and swiftness of mo­ tion2 has been given to the original atoms of matter, you may learn from what follows.
In the first place, when Aurora sprinkles the earth with new light, and the various birds, flit­ ting through the pathless groves, fill every part, amid the soft air, with their liquid notes;
how suddenly, at such a time, the rising sun, overspreading all things, is wont to clothe them with his rays, we observe to be visible and manifest to all.
But that heat, and clear light, which the sun sends forth, do not pass through mere empty space;
on which account, it is compelled to go more slowly, because it has thus to force a passage through the flood of air;
nor do the particles of heat pass every one singly, but connected and combined together;
for which reason they are, at the same time, both retarded by one another, and externally obstructed, so as to be obliged to proceed less rapidly.
But the primordial-atoms, which are of pure solidity,1 when they pass through empty spaced and nothing external retards them;
and when, moreover, they themselves, being one and uncompounded in all their parts, are to that one place borne onwards, by their own tendency,3 to which they have begun to proceed, must be thought, it is evident, to excel in swiftness, and to be carried forwards much more rapidly than the light of the sun, and to run through a much greater region of space 4 in the same time as the beams of the sun traverse the heaven.
For neither have they to delay, being retarded by deliberation how they shall proceed, nor have they to pursue the neighbouring atoms one after the other, that they may learn by what method every thing is to be done.
But some ignorant persons, in opposition to these opinions, think that the nature of matter cannot, without the will and providence of the gods, be ordered so suitably to human plans and conveniences, as to change the seasons of the year, and to produce the fruits of the earth, and to effect also other things in which the directress of life, divine Pleasure, prompts mor­ tals, and herself leads them, to engage;
so that they may pro­ pagate their kind through the allurement of gratification, lest the race of men should perish.
For whose sake, when they imagine that the gods settled all things, they seem in all respects to have departed far from just reasoning.
For though I were ignorant what the primary-elements of things were, yet this I could venture to assert from a contemplation of the nature of heaven itself, and to demonstrate from many other things, that the world was by no means made for us by divine power ;
although these opinions incur reprehension among the generality of mankind.
Which matters, 0 Memmius, I will make clear to you hereafter;
we will now explain what remains to be said concerning the motions of atoms.
This is now the place, as I think, in discussing these sub­ jects, to make plain to you, that no corporeal substance can, of its own proper force, be borne and advance upwards ;
lest the particles of flame should deceive you in this matter.
For though they are produced upwards, and take increase upwards, yet also the smiling corn, and groves, have their growth up­ wards ;
though all weights, as far as is in them, are borne down­ wards.
Nor, when fire springs up to the roofs of houses, and consumes the beams and rafters with a swift flame, is it to be thought that it does so without a compelling force;
as is the case, for example, when blood, sent forth from our body, spouts out, springing up on high, and sprinkling abroad a purple stream.
Do you not see, also, with how strong a force the liquid substance of water repels beams and logs of wood ?
Do you not observe how, the more we have, on any occasion, urged them straight downwards, and have powerfully pressed them down with great force and with difficulty, so the more eagerly the water casts them back and sends them upwards, so that they rise up and leap forth with a larger portion of their substance?
1
And yet we do not doubt, I suppose, that these bodies, as far as is in them, are all borne downwards through empty space.
Thus, accordingly, flames must also have the power to rise, when driven up, through the air of heaven, al­ though their own weights, as far as is in them, strive to draw them downwards.
Do you not, moreover, see that meteors in the night, flying through the height of heaven, draw long tracks of flame in whatever directions nature has given them a passage ?
Do you not see shooting stars fall to the earth ?
The sun, also, from the highest point of the sky, spreads abroad his heat on all sides, and covers the fields with his light ?
The heat of the sun, therefore, also tends downwards to the earth.
And you observe likewise the lightnings fly through the oblique showers;
the fires, bursting from the clouds, rush sometimes in one way, sometimes in another;
and the body of flame falls very frequently to the earthy
In reference to these subjects, also, we wish you to under­ stand this;
that the particles-of-matter, when they are borne downwards straight through the void of space, do for the most part, by their own weights, at some time, though at no fixed and determinate time, and at some points, though at no fixed and determinate points, turn aside2 from the right line, but only so far as you can call the least possible deviation.
But unless the atoms were accustomed to decline from the right line, they would all fall straight down, through the void profound, like drops of rain through the air;
nor would there have been any contact produced, or any collision generated among the primary-elements;
and thus nature would never have produced any thing.
But if, perchance, any one believes that the heavier bodies, as being borne, more swiftly, straight through the void of space, might fall from above on the lighter ones, and thus produce concussions, which might give rise to generative movements, he deviates and departs far from just reasoning.
For whatsoever bodies fall downwards through the water and the air, they, of necessity, must quicken their motions accord­ ing to their weights, inasmuch as the dense consistence of water, and the subtle substance of the air, cannot equally re­ tard every body, but yield sooner to the heavier bodies, being overcome by them.
But, on the contrary, a pure vacuum can afford no resistance to any thing, in any place, or at any time, but must constantly allow it the free passage which its nature requires.
For which reason all bodies, when put into motion, must be equally borne onwards, though not of equal weights, through the unresisting void.
The heavier atoms will, there­ fore, never be able to fall from above on the lighter, nor, of themselves, produce concussions which may vary the motions by which nature performs her operations.
For which cause, it must again and again be acknowledged that atoms decline a little from the straight course, though it need not he admitted that they decline more than the least possible space;
lest we should seem to imagine oblique motions, and truth should refute that supposition.
For this we see to be obvious and manifest, that heavy bodies, as far as depends on themselves, cannot, when they fall from above, advance obliquely ;
a fact which you may yourself see.
But who is there that can see1 that atoms do not at all turn them­ selves aside, even in the least, from the straight direction of their course ?
Further, if all motion is connected and dependent, and a new movement perpetually arises from a former one in a cer­ tain order, and, if the primary-elements do not produce any commencement of motion by deviating from the straight line to break the laws of fate, so that cause may not follow cause in infinite succession, whence comes this freedom of will to all animals in the world ?
2 whence, I say, is this liberty of action wrested from the fates, by means of which we go whereso­ ever inclination leads each of us?
whence is it that we ourselves turn aside and alter our motions, not at any fixed time, nor in any fixed part of space, but just as our mind has prompted us.
For doubtless, in such matters, his own will gives a com­ mencement of action to every man;
and hence motions are diffused through the limbs.
Do you not see also, that when the barriers on the race-course are set open at a certain in­ stant, yet the eager strength of the horses cannot spring for­ ward so suddenly as the inclination itself desires ?
For the whole mass of matter throughout the whole body, excited in all the members, must be collected,l and roused simul­ taneously into action, that it may second the desire of the mind in connexion with it ;
so that you may see that the commencement of motion is produced from the heart, and that the tendency to act proceeds in the first place from the in­ clination of the mind, and is thence spread onwards through the whole body and its members.
Nor is this similar to the case in which we go forwards, when impelled by a blow, from the great strength and violent compulsion of another person, for then it is evident that the whole matter of the entire body moves, and is hurried on­ wards, against our consent, until the will, acting throughout the members, has reined it back.
Do you now see, therefore, that although external force drives along many men, (that is, often drives men along,) and compels them frequently to go forwards against their will, and to be hurried away headlong, yet that there is something in our breast which can struggle against and oppose it;
according to the direction of which, also, the aggregate of matter within us is at times obliged to be guided throughout our several limbs and members, and.
when driven forward, is curbed, and sinks down into rest?
Wherefore you must necessarily confess that the same is the case in the seeds of matter, and that there is some other cause for motion besides strokes and weight, from which this power is innate in them, since we see that nothing can be produced from nothing.
For weight forbids that all effects should be produced by strokes, and as if by external force;
but the cir­ cumstance that our mind itself is not influenced merely by in­ ternal necessity in performing every action, and is not, as if under subjection, compelled only to bear and suffer, this cir- eumstance the slight declination of the primordial-atoms causes, though it takes place neither in any determinate part of space, nor at any determinate time.
Nor was the general body of matter ever more condensed together, or, on the other hand, distributed in parts at greater intervals, than it is at present.
For to that body neither does any increase ever take place, nor is any diminution made from it through decay.
For which reason, in whatever motion the atoms of primordial seeds are now, in the same motion they were in past time, and hereafter will always be moved in a similar manner;
and whatever things have been wont to be produced, will still be produced under like circumstances, and will exist, and grow, and acquire strength, as far as has been granted to each by the laws of nature;
nor can any influence change the sum of things.
For neither is there any part of space to which any kind of matter can fly off from the WHOLE, nor, again, is there any part from which any new force, hav­ ing arisen there, can burst in upon the WHOLE, and thus change the entire order of things and alter its movements.
In these matters, it is not at all to be regarded as wonder­ ful, why, when all the primordial-elements of things are in motion, yet the WHOLE of things seems to stand in perfect rest, except whatever individual thing exhibits motion in its own body.
2
For the entire nature of original-principles lies far removed from our senses, and beneath them;
for which cause, when you cannot see the thing itself, its motions must also hide themselves from your eyes;
especially when even many things that we can see, nevertheless often conceal their motions from us, as being separated from us by a great dis­ tance.
For frequently, upon a hill, we may observe a flock of woolly sheep spread about, cropping the rich pasture, where­ soever the grass, gemmed with fresh dew, calls and invites each;
while the full-fed lambs sport and frisk about with de­ light:
all which objects, from a distance, appear to us con­ fused, and only a whiteness, as it were, seems to rest upon the.
green hill.
Also, when vast legions fill aU the parts of a plain, stirring up the image of war, the gleam of arms then:
raises itself to the sky, and all the land around glitters with brass, while a sound is excited by the force, beneath the feet of the men, and the neighbouring hills, struck with the noise, re-echo the shouts of the troops to the stars of heaven;
and the cavalry, at the same time, swiftly-wheel about, and suddenly charge across the plains in the centre, shaking them with their violent onset;
all these are distinct objects, and yet there is a certain spot on the high hills, whence, if you look down, they seem to rest on the ground as one body, and only a con­ tinuous brightness to settle over the field.
Attend now, 0 Memmius,1 and learn, in the next place, of, what nature the primordial-elements of things are, and how very different they are in their forms;
how they are varied by manifold shapes.
Not that a few only are endowed with;
ike form, for those alike are innumerable, but because, through­ out the whole, 2 all are not similar to all, but are varied with great differences.
Nor is this wonderful;
for since the abund­ ance of them is such, that, as I have shown, there is neither­ any limit nor sum of them, they must not, and cannot, assured­ ly, be all universally endowed with a like figure and like shape to all others.
3
Besides, consider the human race, and the mute swarms of fishes swimming in the sea, and the abundant herds of cattle and wild beasts, and the various birds, which frequent the:
pleasant places about the waters, upon the banks of rivers, fountains, and lakes, and which, flitting through the trees, traverse the pathless groves;
of which select any one you please, in the several kinds, for contemplation, and you will still find that they differ from one another in their forms.
Nor, indeed, could the progeny, by any other means, know its mother, or the mother her progeny;
whereas we see that in tenor animals, not less than men, are known to each other.
For, on many occasions, a calf, sacrificed at the frankin­ cense-burning altars, falls before the beauteous temples of the gods, pouring forth a warm stream of blood from its breast;
but the mother, meanwhile, deprived of her young, wandering through the green forests, leaves traces imprinted on the ground with her cloven feet, surveying all places with her eyes, if any where she may discern her lost offspring, and then, standing still, fills the leafy grove with her complaints;
she also frequently goes back to look at the stall, penetrated with regret for her calf;
nor are the tender willows, or the grass fresh with dew, or any streams, gliding level with the top of their banks, able to soothe her feelings, and drive away her sudden affliction ;
nor can any other forms of calves, over the fertile pastures, divert her attention or lighten her of her care;
so perseveringly does she require some shape that is familiar and known to her.
Moreover, the tender kids, with their tremulous voices, know, as they plainly indicate, their horned dams, and sheep distinguish the bleating of the butting lamb;
and thus, as nature requires, each hastens invariably to its own milky udder.
1
Lastly, contemplate any sorts of corn,2 and still you will not find the whole of each in its own kind, or all the grains of each, to have such a mutual resemblance, but that some difference will run between their forms.
And in like manner we see the various sorts of shells paint the lap of the earth, where the sea, with gentle waves, strews the bibulous sand on the winding shored Again and again, therefore, I repeat, the primordial atoms of things, since they exist in their own nature, and are not fashioned to a certain shape by the hand of one artificer, must likewise circulate through the universe in certain shapes dissimilar one from another.
It is very easy for us, then, by the clear guidance of rea.
son, to explain why the flame of lightning passes through the air with much more penetration than our fire, which arises from fuel of the earth.
For you may justly argue that the celestial fire of lightning, as being more subtle, consists of smaller atoms, and therefore flies through diminutive passages, which this fire of ours, taking its rise from wood, and pro­ duced by torches, cannot enter.
Besides, light passes through horn, but water is repelled by it.
Why?
unless that the atoms of light are less than those of which the genial liquid of water consists.
Wine, also, we observe to flow as quickly as possible through a strainer, but thick oil, on the contrary, moves through it slowly;
because, as it appears, the latter either consists of larger atoms, or of such as are more hooked and involved with one another.
And thus it happens, that the individual atoms, not being so quickly detached from their coherence with each other, cannot so easily pass through the individual pores of any body.
To this is added, that the liquids of honey and milk are moved about in the mouth with a pleasant sensation to the tongue;
but, on the contrary, the bitter substance of worm­ wood, and acrid centaury,2 torment the palate with a disa­ greeable taste;
so that you may easily infer that those things which can affect the senses with pleasure, consist of smooth and round particles;
but that, on the other hand, whatever things seem bitter and rough, are held united together of par.
icles more hooked;
and that, on this account, they are ac­ customed, as it were, to tear a way to our feelings, and to wound the skin of our body at their entrance.
Furthermore, all things which are pleasing to the senses, and all which are to the touch unpleasant, are opposed to each other, being formed of atoms of a different shape;
that you may not, perchance, imagine that the sharp stridor of the creaking saw consists of elements equally smooth with the melodious notes of music, which musicians form upon the strings, awaked, as it were, by their swiftly-moving fingers;
and that you may not suppose that atoms of like form pene­ trate the nostrils of men, when they burn offensively-smelling carcasses, and when the stage is freshly sprinkled with Cilician saffron,1 and the altar, near at hand, exhales Panchæan odours.
Nor conceive that pleasing colours, which can feast the eye with delight, and those which are, as it were, pungent to the sight, and compel us to shed tears, or which seem ugly and hideous with a repulsive look, consist of like seminal-atoms.
For every object, whatever it be, that soothes the sense ot the beholders, is not produced without some smoothness in its elements, but, on the contrary, whatever is of a disagreeable and rough consistence, has not been formed without something offensive in its material-principles.
There are some atoms, also, which are neither justly thought to be smooth, nor altogether hooked with bent points, but rather to be furnished with small angles slightly jutting out, and which have the power rather to titillate the sense than to wound it;
of which kind of atoms consist pickle1 and the taste of elecampane.
Moreover that warm fire and cold frost penetrate the feel­ ings of the body differently, as being composed of atoms pointed in different ways, the touch of each is a sufficient indication.
For the touch, the touch, (0 sacred deities of heaven !) is a sense of the body;
and is affected either when something external insinuates itself through the pores, or when something which is generated in the body, hurts or delights it in issuing forth, as in the genial exercises of Venus;
or when the seeds, from striking against each other, raise a tumult in the body itself, and, by mutual agitation, confound the sense;
as if, for example, you yourself should strike any part of your own body, and make trial of this sensation.
For which reason forms of substance, which can excite various feelings, must necessarily be far different in their elementary-principles.
Further, those bodies that seem to us hard and dense, must necessarily consist of particles more locked with one another, and be held closely compacted,' as it were, by branching atoms.
Among which kind of bodies, adamantine rocks, naturally- adapted to despise blows, stand pre-eminently in the first rank:
as well as stout flints, and the strength of hard iron, and brazen hinges, which, as they support the weight of their gates, make a loud grating sound.
2
Those bodies, indeed, which are liquid and of a fluid sub* stance, must consist, more than harder bodies, of smooth and round atoms;
(for a draught of poppy-juice3 is even as yield­ ing, and as much of a liquid, as a draught of water;
) since their several collections-of-particles are not held together rigidly among themselves, and their progress along a descent is voluble and easy.
All things, moreover, which you see scatter themselves in a short space of time, as smoke, clouds, and flames, must neces­ sarily, if they do not wholly consist of smooth and round par­ ticles, yet not be bound together with complex ones;
so that, being as they are, they may have a pungent effect upon the body,1 and penetrate rocks, but cannot cohere together;
a power which we all see to be granted to thorns.
You may easily understand, therefore, that they do not consist of hooked and complicated, but of acute atoms.
But that you should observe the same bodies, which are fluid, to be bitter, as is the liquid of the sea, is by no means to be wondered at by any one.
For that which is fluid, con­ sists of smooth and round particles;
and with these smooth and round particles are mixed pungent particles causing pain.
Nor yet is it necessary that these atoms should hold themselves together by being hooked;
for you may be certain that though the particles are rough, they are yet globose, so that they may flow among those of the fluid, though at the same time they may hurt the sense.
And that you may the more cer­ tainly believe that rough are mixed with smooth particles, of both of which, for instance, the mass of the waters of the ocean consists, there is, I may mention, a method of separating them and considering them apart.
The same water of the sea, for example, becomes sweet,2 when it is often filtered through the earth, so that it may flow, as you may sometimes see, into a trench, and thus lose its saltness.
For it leaves above, or near the surface of the earth, the particles of bitter salt, which are rough and jagged;
so that they more easily inhere in the earth.
Which point since I have now demonstrated, I shall proceed to join with it another proposition, which, depending on this, derives its creditfrom it;
that the primary-atoms of things vary in figure, but only with a limited number of shapes.
1
If this were not so, some seminal-principles would, moreover, necessa­ rily he of an immense bulk of body.
For this is evident, be­ cause within the same individual minute-frame of any one seminal-principle, the figures or arrangements of its parts cannot vary much among themselves.
Since, suppose that the primary-principles consist of a certain definite number of very small parts;
say three, or increase them, if you please, by a few more;
assuredly when, after arranging all those parts, and altering the place of the highest and lowest parts of that one body, anti changing the right for the left, you shall have tried in every way what representation of forms each arrange­ ment of the whole of that body offers, if perchance you shall wish still further to vary its forms, you will have to add other parts;
and from thence will follow, in like manner, that a third arrangement will require still more, if you shall wish by a third arrangement still to vary its forms.
An increase of bulk, therefore, follows upon the variation of shapes;
for which reason you cannot believe that seminal-principles differ from one another by an infinite variety of shapes;
lest, by such a supposition, you should make some to be of immense bulk;
which I have already shown that it is not possible to prove.
And if such were the case, if the figures of atoms were in.
finite, barbaric garments, and shining Melibœan purple,2 tinged with the dye of shell-fish from Thessaly, as well as the golden brood of peacocks, painted with smiling beauty, would-lose­ their-estimation in your eyes, being thrown-into-the-shade by the new beauty of fresh objects;
the perfume of myrrh and the taste of honey would be despised;
and the melodies of swans, and the tunes of Phœbus, varied on the chords of the lyre, would, in like manner, be silenced, as being outdone by something new;
for, in every class of things, some new thing might arise more excellent than others which are now thought the bestOr all things might also fall back into a worse state, as we have said that they might possibly rise to a better.
For, in a retrograde order, one thing might arise, time after time, more disagreeable than others preceding it, to the nostrils, ears, and eyes, and taste of the palate.
Since this, however, is not so, but a certain limit set to things in both directions, as to what is bad and what is good, confines the whole, you must of necessity admit that the particles of matter also vary from one another only by shapes that are finite in number.
Lastly, a distance, so to speak, has been defined from the heat of summer1 to the freezing cold of winter, and has been measured back from cold to heat in like manner.
For the whole year is, or consists of, heat and cold ;
2 and the moderate warmths of spring and autumn lie between both the other two seasons, filling up the whole in succession.
The seasons of spring and autumn, therefore, as made and appointed, are kept-distinct by a limited portion to each ;
since they are marked on each side by two points, and shut in on the one hand by heats, and on the other side by rigid frosts.
Since I have now proved this, I shall proceed to join with it another observation, which, depending on this, derives its credit from it;
that the primordial-atoms of things, which are formed of a like figure one to the other, are infinite in number ;
for since the diversity of their forms is finite, it ne­ cessarily follows that those which are alike are infinite;
or it would appear that the sum of matter must be finite;
which I have proved to be impossible.
Since I have shown this, I will now (give me your atten* tion) demonstrate in a few sweetly-sounding verses, that the atoms of matter support the WHOLE OF THINGS, from all eter­ nity,1 by a succession2 of movements on every side.
For though you see in any particular region certain ani­ mals to be more rare than others, and observe Nature, in those less rare, to be more productive,3 yet in another region and dis­ trict, and in distant lands, it is possible that there may be many animals of that kind, and that the deficiency of their numbers in one place may be compensated in another;
just as we see, in the race of quadrupeds, to be especially the case with the snake-handed elephants, with many thousands of which India is defended as with an ivory rampart, so that it cannot be at all penetrated;
so great is the multitude of those beasts in that country, but of which we see very few specimens among us.
But yet, that I may, if you wish, grant this also,4 let there be, in your imagination, any single creature you please, existing alone with its own natural body, and to which there may be no creature similar in the whole round of the earth;
yet, un­ less the quantity of the seeds of matter, from which that crea­ lure may be formed and generated, shall be infinite in number, it will neither be possible for it to be produced, nor moreover, if it could be produced, to grow up and be nourished.
For let your eyes conceive (i. e. imagine that you see) the generative atoms of any single thing, being limited in num­ ber, tossed about through the whole of space ;
whence, I ask, where, by what force, and by what means, will they, meeting together, unite, amid so vast an ocean of matter, and so mighty a, confusion of dissimilar particles ?
They have, as I think, no method of combining themselves.
But, as when great and numerous shipwrecks have arisen, the vast sea is wont to scat­ ter abroad floating benches, hollow fragments1 of vessels, sail­ yards, prows, masts, and oars ;
so that the ornaments of sterns 2 may be seen swimming on all the coasts of the earth, and may give admonition to mortals, to resolve to avoid the treachery, and violence, and deceit of the faithless sea;
nor, on any oc­ casion, to be too credulous, when the insidious flattery of the calm deep smiles;
so if you, in this case, shall once settle for yourself that certain primordial atoms are finite in number, you must then allow that the different agitations of matter will necessarily toss them about, scattered, as they will be, for ever;
so that they can at no time, being driven together, unite in combination, or, if they should unite, remain in combination, or swell with increase ;
both of which effects manifest proof shows to occur before our eyes, namely, that things are produced, and that, when produced, they have the power to increase.
It is therefore evident, that, in every class of beings, the primordial- elements of things, from which all are supplied, are infinite in number.
Nor, therefore, inasmuch as original-elements are infinite, can the movements of things, which are destructive to vital existence, always prevail, or bury its safety for ever;
though neither, on the other hand, can motions productive of gener­ ation and increase, always preserve things which have been formed.
Thus a war of principles, grown up from the infi­ nite space of the past, is carried on with equal strife;
the vital principles of things prevail sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, and are prevailed over in their turn.
The wail which infants raise, when they come forth to view the regions of light, is mixed with funeral lamentations ;
nor has any night followed a day, or any morning followed a night, which has not heard groans, the attendants of death and gloomy obsequies, mixed with the weak cries of infants coming into the world.
In considering these points, it is- proper for you, also, to have it impressed, as with a seal, upon your mind, and to keep it faithfully intrusted to your memory, that there is nothing, among all objects of which the nature is apparent before us, which consists only of one kind of elements;
nor any thing, which does not consist of mixed seminal-principles.
And whatever possesses in itself more numerous powers and ener­ gies than other things, thus demonstrates that it contains more numerous kinds of primary-particles and various configura­ tions of them.
In the first place, the earth has in itself primary atoms, from which springs, rolling forth cool waters, incessantly recruit the immense sea;
it has also in itself atoms from which fires arise.
For in many places, the soil of the earth, when set on fire, burns;
and the violence of Ætna rages with mighty flames.
Moreover, the earth contains atoms from which it can raise up rich corn and cheerful groves for the tribes of men ;
and from which also it can afford waving leaves and abundant pasturage for the brood of wild beasts ranging over the mountains.
For which reasons the earth alone is called the great mother of the gods, and mother of beasts, and parent of the human race.
The old and learned poets of the decks sung that she, in her seat on her chariot, drives two lions yoked together;
sig­ nifying that the vast earth hangs in the open space of the air, and that one earth cannot stand upon another earth.
They added the lions, because any offspring, however wild, ought to be softened, when influenced by the good offices of parents.
And they surrounded the top of her head with a mural crown, because the earth, fortified in lofty places, sustains cities ;
dis­ tinguished with which decoration the image of the divine mother is borne, spreading terror, through the wide world.
Her various nations, according to the ancient practice of their worship, call the Idæan mother, and assign her bands of Phrygians as attendants, because they say that from those parts corn first began to be produced, and thence was diffused over the globe of the earth.
They assign to her also the Galli;
because they wish to intimate that those, who have violated the sacred-respect due to their mother, and have been found ungrateful to their fathers, are to be thought unworthy to bring living offspring into the realms of light.
Distended drums, and hollow cymbal resound in their hands around the goddess;
and their horns threaten with a hoarse noise, while the hollow pipe excites their minds with Phrygian notes.
And they carry weapons outstretched before them, as signs of violent rage, which may alarm with terror the undutiful minds and impious hearts of the crowd, struck with the power of the goddess.
As soon, therefore, as, riding through great cities, she, being dumb, bestows a silent blessing on mortals, they strew the whole course of the road with brass and silver, enriching her with munificent contributions ;
while they diffuse a shower of roses, overshadowing the mother and her troop of attend­ ants.
Here the armed band, whom the Greeks call by the name of Phrygian Curetes, dance round vigorously with ropes,1 and leap about to their tune, streaming with blood.
Shaking the terrible crests on their heads as they nod, they represent the Dictæan Curetes, who are formerly said, in Crete, to have concealed that famous infant-cry of Jupiter, when the armed youths, in a swift dance around the child, struck, in tune, their brazen shields with their brazen spears, lest Saturn, having got possession of him, should devour him, and cause an eternal wound in the heart of his mother.
Either for this reason, therefore, armed men accompany the great mother;
or else because the priests thus signify that the goddess ad­ monishes men to be willing to defend the land of their country with arms and valour, and to prepare themselves to be a pro­ tection and honour to their parents.
These pageants, though celebrated as being fitly and excel­ lently contrived, are yet far removed from sound reason.
For the whole race of the gods must necessarily, of itself, enjoy its immortal existence in the most profound tranquillity, far removed and separated from our affairs;
since, being free from all pain, exempt from all dangers, powerful itself in its own resources, and wanting nothing of us, it is neither propitiated by services from the good, nor affected with anger against the bad.
The earth, indeed, is at all times void of sense, but, because it contains the primary elements of many things, it brings forth many productions, in many ways, into the light of the sun.
If any one, then, shall resolve to call the sea Neptune, and corn Ceres, and chooses rather to abuse the name of Bac­ chus, than to utter the proper appellation of wine;
let us concede that such a one may pronounce the orb of the earth to be the mother of the gods, provided that it still be allowed to remain its real self.
But to return, then, to the infinite variety of atoms, the woolly sheep,1 we often see, cropping the grass from the same plain, and the warlike brood of horses, and the horned herds, living under the same part of the canopy of heaven, and quenching their thirst from the same stream of water, grow up of dissimilar species, retaining the parent nature;
and all follow habits according to their kinds;
so various is the nature of the matter in each kind of herb;
so great is the variety of particles in each river.
Hence, moreover, though, the same parts, bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, viscera, and nerves, make up any one you please of all animals, still these, being very different in themselves, are formed of pri­ mary-particles of an entirely different figure.
Further, whatever bodies, being set on fire, burn, show that there are cherished in their mass, if nothing else, those various seminal-atoms, from which they are enabled to throw forth fire and cast up light, and also to put sparks in motion, and scatter abroad embers.
Surveying other things with like reasoning, you will ac­ cordingly find that they conceal in their consistence the seeds of many things, and contain various conformations of atoms.
Again, you observe many objects to which both colour and taste have been assigned, together with smell;
especially most of the gifts which you offer to the gods, when you feel your mind affected, in a debasing manner,2 with religion.
These things must therefore consist of various conformations of atoms;
for scent penetrates where juices which excite the taste do not make a way to the corporeal organs;
also juices by their particular method, and flavour by its particular method, win their way to the senses;
so that you may know that they arise from different conformations of atoms.
Dis­ similar forms of particles, therefore, combine in one mass, and things consist of mixed seminal-principles.
Besides, even in my own verses you see every where many elements common to many words;
though you must neverthe­ less necessarily acknowledge that the verses and words con­ sist part of some elements and part of others, differing among themselves ;
not because only a few common letters run through the words, or because no two words, out of all, are alike in having any letter in common ;
2 but because, taking the words throughout, all the letters are not common to all.
So likewise in other matters, many common elements, as they are the pri­ mary-principles of many things, may yet exist in dissimilar combinations among themselves;
so that the human race, and the fruits of the earth, and the rich groves, may justly be considered to consist each of distinct original-particles.
Nor yet is it to be thought that all particles can be com­ bined in all ways;
for, if this were the case, you would every where see monsters arise;
you would behold shapes produced half-man half-beast, and sometimes tall boughs of trees grow out of an animated body ;
you would observe many members of terrestrial animals united to those of marine animals, and nature breeding, throughout the all-producing earth, Chimæ­ ras breathing flame from horrid mouths.
Of which irregu­ larities it is evident that none occur, since we see that all things, being produced from certain seeds, by an unerring generative nature, can, as they grow up, preserve their kind pure and unmixed.
And it is plain that this must necessarily be the case ac­ cording to strict method and laws.
For, from the several sorts of food that are eaten, the particles, suitable to each animal, pass internally into its limbs and other parts, and, being there combined, produce motions fitted to that animal.
But, on the other hand, we see that nature throws back upon the earth those particles which are unsuitable to the animal;
and many, existing in imperceptible substances, escape out of the body, being wrought upon by the impulses and agitations of other particles;
which effluent particles could neither be combined in any part, nor consent, and be animated, to par­ ticipate in the vital movements.
But lest you should think that animals only are bound by these laws, a certain order and regularity, let me observe, keeps all things distinct.
For as, throughout the whole of nature, things dissimilar from one another are individually produced, so it is necessary that each should consist of a differ­ ent form of elements.
Not that only a few elements are endowed with like forms, but because all, throughout all bodies, are not similar to all.
Since, moreover, seminal particles differ, their intervals, passages, connexions, weights, impulses, collisions, motions, must necessarily differ;
variations which not only keep dis­ tinct the bodies of animals, but give peculiarity to the land and the whole sea, and cause the heaven to differ in nature from the earth.
And now attendfurther,1 and receive into your mind my pre­ cepts which I, with pleasing toil, have collected together.
Do not, by any chance, imagine that those things which you see be fore your eyes of a white colour consist, because they are white, of white elemental-atoms;
or that those which are black, arc produced from black seminal-particles;
nor suppose that any objects, which are tinged with any other colour whatsoever, wear that colour because their material elements are tinctured with a hue similar to it.
For there is no colour at all in the ele­ mentary-atoms of matter, either similar to that of the bodies in which they exist, or dissimilar.
Into the nature of which ele­ mentary atoms, if you think that the mind cannot penetrate, so as to form an idea of them, because they are without colour, you wander far away from the truth.
Since, when those who have been born blind, and who have never seen the light of the sun, yet distinguish substances by the touch, which to them have seemed unmarked by colours from their earliest youth, we may understand also that substances actually un­ tinctured with colour, may be brought under the comprehen­ sion of our intellect.
Moreover whatever objects we ourselves touch in thick darkness, we do not perceive to be tinged with any colour at all.
Since I prove it to be possible that atoms may be colourless, I will now show that it certainly is so.
For every colour is, or may be, changed into all colours whatsoever;
but this is a transmutation which primordial elements must by no means undergo ;
since it is necessary that there should remain some­ thing unchangeable, lest all things should be reduced utterly to nothing.
For whatsoever being changed,1 goes beyond its own limits, this change forthwith becomes the death or termin­ ation of that which it was before.
Be cautious, therefore, not to tinge the seeds of things with colours, lest all things for your gratification2 should be reduced to nothing.
Besides, if no kind of colour has been assigned to primary- particles, and if they are endowed with various forms, by which they generate and vary all kinds of colours ;
and since, more­ over, it is of great consequence with what atoms, and in what configuration, seminal-particles are severally combined, and what impacts they mutually give and receive;
you may at once, with the greatest ease, render a reason why those objects which were a while ago of a black colour, may sud­ denly become of a marble whiteness;
as when the sea, after violent winds have stirred up its waters, is changed in hue, and boils up into waves white as the whiteness of marble
For you may readily say of any object which we generally observe to be black, that, when its material-atoms have been disturbed, and the order of the particles changed, and some taken away and others added, it forthwith becomes possible that it may seem of a glowing whiteness.
1
But if the waters of the sea consisted of cærulean atoms, they could by no means become white;
for, in whatever way you may disorder and commingle those atoms which are cærulean, they can never pass into the colour of marble.
But if the atoms which make up the simple and pure colour of the sea, were tinged with va­ rious and diverse colours;
as frequently we see, from different forms and dissimilar figures, is formed a perfect square, con­ sisting of only one figure ;
it would follow, that, as in the square we see the other different figures exist, so in the water of the sea, or in any other simple and pure colour, we should see those wholly different and distinct colours, from which the uniform colour of the sea proceeds.
Further, the different figures which make up the square, by no means hinder or prevent the whole outline2 of the com­ pound figure from being or appearing square;
but the various colours of any substances which make up any compound sub­ stance, impede and prohibit that whole compound substance from possibly being of one uniform hue.
Then, moreover, the reason which prompts and induces us sometimes to impute colours to primary-particles, namely, that coloured substances are compounded of them, passes for no­ thing ;
because white substances, as the foam of the sea for instance, are not necessarily produced from other white sub­ stances;
nor substances which are black, from other black sub­ stances;
but from substances of various colours;
and because, moreover, white substances will more readily arise, and be produced, from primary-particles of no colour than from pri­ mary-particles of a black colour, or from particles of any other colour whatsoever that is adverse and opposed to white.
Further, since there can be no colours without light, and the primary-particles of things do not come forth into the light,3 you may hence feel certain that they are vested with no colours at all.
For what sort of colour will there possible exist in thick darkness, when colour is a thing which is changed in and by mere light, because it appears different, as it is struck by direct or oblique light ?
As the plumage of doves which is situate round the back of the head, and encir­ cles the neck, appears of a different colour as it is seen differ­ ently in the sun.
For in one position it is affected so as to be red with the huC of the bright carbuncle;
at another time, in a certain aspect,1 it is so changed that it seems to mix the colour of green emeralds with blue.
The tail of the peacock, also, when it is covered with a flood of light, changes its co­ lours, as it is presented in different ways, in like manner.
And since all these colours are produced by a certain effect of the light, it must be considered that colour cannot be produced at all, without that light.
Since, too, the pupil of the eye2 receives upon itself one kind of impulse when it is said to perceive a white colour, and another again, when it perceives black and other colours;
and since it is of no moment, as to the feeling, with what colour those things, which you touch, are distinguished, but rather of what shape they are formed, you may conclude that primary-particles have no need of colours, but have only to affect the touch differently through the different forms in which they are combined.
Besides, since there is no certain kind of colours peculiar3 to certain shapes, and sin.e all shapes of seminal-atoms may exist with any colour whatsoever, why, if we suppose that seminal- atoms, which are of manifold shapes, have colour, are not those creatures which consist of those seminal-atoms, sprinkled over accordingly with all sorts of colours, each in its several kind, whatsoever it may be ?
For, under this supposition, it might be expected that crows, as they fly, would often shed forth a white colour from white feathers, and that swans, if spring­ ing perchance from black atoms, would be born black, or, if from atoms of any other colour, might be of any other hue whatsoever, uniform or varied.
Moreover, the more any body is divided into small parts, the more you can see its colour by degrees die away and be­ come extinct, as happens when gold is broken into small frag­ ments.
So purple and scarlet, (by far the brightest of colours,) when they have been divided thread by thread, are utterly deprived of lustre.
So that you may from this infer, that the small parts of bodies throw off all colour, before they are re­ duced to their ultimate-atoms.
Further, since you grant that all bodies do not emit sound or smell, it consequently happens that you do not attribute to all bodies sounds or smells.
So, since we cannot see all bodies with our eyes, we may conceive that certain bodies exist, which we do not see, as much destitute of colour as others are free from smell, and void of sound;
and that an intelligent mind can form a notion of these colourless bodies, no less than of others which are destitute of other qualities and distinctions.
But that you may not perchance imagine that primary atoms remain void of colour only, they are also, you may understand, altogether destitute of heat and cold ;
1 and are understood to be barren of sound, and dry of all moisture;
nor do they send out any odour of their own from their substance.
Thus when you proceed to compound a sweet ointment of amaracus, and myrrh, and the flower of nard, which breathes nectar to the nostrils, it is, in the first place, proper to seek, as far as is convenient, and as far as you may be able to find, the sub­ stance of inodorous olive oil, which emits no scent to the nostrils, that it may, as little as possible, by the infection of any strong smell of its own, corrupt the odours mixed and digested in its body as a vehicle for them.
Finally, therefore, it must be granted that the primary-atoms of things communicate no odour or sound of their own, to the things to be produced from them, since they can emit from them­ selves none of these qualities;
nor, in like manner, do they emit any savour at all, or cold or heat.
Other qualities, moreover,2 which are such that they are themselves, and in the bodies with which they are connected, perishable, as pliancy from soft­ ness, brittleness from decay, hollowness from tenuity of sub­ stance, must all, of necessity, be separated from primary-ele­ ments, if we wish to lay an everlasting foundation for things, on which their entire security may rest, that the whole universe may not be resolved into nothing.
And now let me observe that those creatures, whatsoever they are that we perceive to have sense, you must necessarily acknowledge to consist wholly of senseless atoms.
3
Nor do manifest appearances,4 which are readily observed, refute this position, or in the least oppose it, but rather themselves lead us by the hand, as it were, and compel us to believe that ani­ mals, though possessed of sense, are generated, as I say, from atoms without sense.
For you may observe living worms proceed from foul dung, when the earth, moistened with immoderate showers, has contracted a kind of putrescence;
and you may see all other things besides change themselves, similarly, into other things.
The rivers turn themselves into leaves of trees;
and the rich pastures into cattle;
the cattle change their substance into that of our bodies;
and from our bodies the strength of wild beasts, and the frames of birds, are often augmented.
Nature, therefore, changes all kinds of food into living bodies, and hence produces all senses of animals in a method not very far different from that by which she resolves dry wood into flames, and turns all combustible bodies into fire.
Do you now understand, therefore, that it is of great im­ portance in what order the primordial elements of things are severally placed, and with what other elements being mingled, they give and receive impulses ?
Besides, what is it that acts upon your mind, what moves you, and induces you to express a different opinion, preventing you from believing that what is possessed of sense is produced from atoms without sense ?
It is, evidently, this:
that stones, and wood, and earthy however mixed together, are neverthe­ less unable to produce vital sense.
On these subjects, then, it will be proper for you to remem­ ber this principle,2 that I do not say that what has sense, or that senses themselves, are of course3 produced from all atoms in general, whatsoever generate things;
but that it is of great im­ portance, in the first place, of what size those atoms are which are to produce a being of sense, and with what shape they are distinguished;
and, in the next place, what they are in their movements, arrangements, and positions ;
of which par­ ticulars, we, from our imperfect perceptions, see nothing take place in wood and clods ;
and yet these, when they are as it were rendered putrescent by rain, produce worms, and for this reason, because the atoms of matter, being driven from their former arrangements by some new impulse, are combined in such a manner as makes it indispensable for animals to be produced.
Besides, when philosophers determine that a being which has sense can be produced only from atoms endowed with sense, they forthwith, accustomed to adopt opinions from others, make those atoms soft;
for all sense is connected with viscera, nerves, veins, and whatever soft substances we see exist and grow in a mortal body.
But let it be supposed, for a moment, that these atoms, of which animals consist, may, though sensible and soft, remain eternal.
They must then, however, either have sense as parts of animals,1 or be thought similar to whole animals.
But it cannot be that as parts they have sense of themselves, for every part and member, if separated from the body, breaks off con­ nexion with the other senses of the other members ;
2 nor can the hand, when dissevered from us, nor any part of the body whatsoever, retain alone the sense of the whole body.
It re­ mains, therefore, that they must resemble whole animals, so that they may be animated with vital sense throughout.
But how, then, will it be possible for them to be called the elements of things, and avoid the paths to death, when they are of an animal nature, and, existing themselves in perishable animals, are one and the same with them?
Yet if we allow that primordial atoms, though imperishable, may nevertheless be endowed with sense, they will necessarily in that case produce nothing but a crewd and multitude of animals;
just as men, cattle, and wild beasts, would be un­ able to produce by combination severally among themselves, any thing but men, cattle, and wild beasts.
How then could things inanimate, as trees and metals, be produced?
It is only on this supposition, accordingly,1 (viz. that they can ge- MeTate nothing but sentient beings,) that we should be obliged, as far as we see, to allow primordial-atoms to be sentient.
But if, perhaps, you say that the primordial-atoms, being, as you think, sentient, lay aside, in combination, their own proper sense, and take another, what need was there, in that case, that that should be assigned to them, which is afterwards taken away?
And besides, to recur to an illustration to which we had recourse before, inasmuch as we see eggs of animals changed into birds, and worms spring forth when a kind of putrescence, from immoderate rains, has affected the ground, we know that animals having senses may be produced from objects without senses.
But if any one, perchance, shall say that sentient-beings may certainly2 arise from senseless atoms, but that this must be effected by some CHANGE which takes place in those atoms, as from some new BIRTH, before the sentient being which they con­ stitute is brought forth into existence, it will be sufficient to explain and prove to him, that no BIRTH ever takes place, un­ less from some combination previously formed, and that no CHANGE is effected without a combination of primordial -atoms ;
for no senses of any animal body can exist before the substanco itself of the animal is formed;
and this is evident, inasmuch as senseless matter is kept dispersed throughout the air, rivers, earth, and things produced from the earth;
nor, though it may have united,1 has it so united as to engender in itself those con­ cordant vital motions, by which the all-observing senses of ani­ mals being generated, direct and preserve every living creature.
Besides, a blow inflicted, if heavier2 than nature can endure, strikes down any animal at once, and has the effect of con­ founding all sense of the body and of the mind;
for the posi­ tions and connexions of the atoms are dissolved, and the vital motions are utterly impeded;
until at last the matter of the body, suffering concussion in every member, unlooses from the body the vital ties of the soul, and drives it forth, scat­ tered abroad, through every outlet.
For what more can we suppose that an inflicted blow can do, than shake to pieces and dissolve the several elements that were previously united ?
It also happens, that when a blow is inflicted with less vio­ lence, the remains of vital motion often prevail;
prevail, 1 say, over the effects of it, and calm the violent disorders occa­ sioned by the stroke, and recall every thing again into its proper channel;
and thus dispel, as it were, the movement of death, when asserting-its-power in the body, and revive the senses when almost lost and overcome.
For under what in­ fluence, if not under this revival of the sentient motions, can bodies return to life, the mind being re-established,3 even from the very threshold of dissolution, rather than depart and pass away to the bourne to which they had almost accomplished their course ?
Furthermore, since pain happens when the principles of matter in any living body, disturbed by any force throughout the viscera or the limbs, are agitated in their situations with­ in, and driven from their proper places;
and since an agree­ able pleasure succeeds when they return into their places ;
it is but right to infer, that primordial-atoms can be affected with no pain, and enjoy no pleasure, of themselves;
for they, being primary bodies, do not consist of those combinations of primary-bodies, the motions of which suffer pain, or receive enjoyment of gentle pleasure, from alteration.
Primordial atoms, therefore, must not be considered as endowed with any sense whatever.
Besides, if, in order that animals may severally have sense, sense is also to be attributed to their primary-elements, then, forsooth, the elements of which the human race is peculiarly constituted, both laugh, shaking their sides1 with tremulous cachinnation, and sprinkle their faces and cheeks with distil­ ling tears;
they, moreover, can tell much of the mixture of bodies, and inquire, besides, what are their own elements.
For, as they resemble entire men, compounded of elements, they themselves must also be compounded of other elements;
and these others must be composed of others again, so that, reckoning thus, you would never make a stop, but go on to in­ finity.
For I shall pursue the argument, and demand that whatever you shall admit to speak, and laugh, and under­ stand, must consist of other elements exercising the same powers.
But if we plainly see such reasoning to be absurd and insane;
and if a being can laugh that is compounded of elements which do not laugh, and can understand, and render a reason in intelligible words, though he be not com­ pounded of intelligent and eloquent seminal-principles, why may not all those creatures which we observe to be sentient around us, be compounded of seminal-atoms wholly destitute of sense?
Finally, we are all sprung from celestial seed;
the father of all is the same ÆTHER, from which, when the bountiful earth has received the liquid drops of moisture, she, being impregnated, produces the rich crops and the joyous groves, and the race of men;
produces all the tribes of beasts;
since she supplies them food, by means of which they all support their bodies, and lead a pleasant life, and propagate offspring ;
on which account she has justly obtained the name of Mother.
That, also, which first arose from the earth, returns back into the earth;
and that which was sent down from the regions of the sky, the regions of the sky again receive when carried back to them;
nor does death so put an end to things as to destroy the atoms of matter, but only disunites their combinations, and produces new unions of particles, and is the cause that all things so change their forms, and vary their colours, and receive perception, and in a moment of time yield it up again.
So that you may understand it to be of the greatest import­ ance with what elements, and in what position and connexion, the same primordial-atoms of things are combined, and what impulses they mutually give and receive;
(nor suppose that the primary particles of things cannot remain eternal, because we see them fluctuate upon the surface of things, and some­ times apparently born and suddenly perish;
) as even in these very verses of mine it is of great consequence with what letters, and in what order, other letters are severally placed;
for the same letters, variously selected and combined, signify heaven, sea, earth, rivers, sun ;
the same signify corn, groves, animals;
if the words are not all, yet by far the greater part are, alike, 1 at least so far as to have some letter or letters in common;
but the subjects which they express are distinguished by the different arrangements of the letters to form the words.
So likewise even in things themselves, when the intervals, passages, connexions, weights, impulses, collisions, move­ ments, order, position, and configurations of the atoms of matter are interchanged, the things which are formed from them must also be changed.
Give your attention now, closely, 1 to the conclusions of just reasoning, from what we have previously stated.
For a new doctrine presses earnestly to approach your ear, and a new scene of things to display itself.
But neither is any thing so easy, or credible, as that it may not seem rather difficult of be­ lief at first;
nor, likewise, is there any thing so great, or any thing so admirable at first, at which all men alike do not by degrees less and less wonder.
In the first place, consider the bright and pure colour of the sky, and that which the stars, wandering in all directions, contain in themselves, and the resplendency, from brilliancy of light, of the moon and the sun;
all which objects, if they were now first apparent to mortal eyes ;
if they were, I say, now first presented to them unexpectedly and suddenly, what could be mentioned, which would be more wonderful than these phenomena, or which the nations of the world could less presume, beforehand, to believe would exist ?
Nothing, as I conceive;
so wonderful to men would this scene of things have been, for the sake of which no man, you may observe, now deigns to look up to the bright regions of the sky, every one being listless from satiety of viewing it.
Wherefore for­ bear, through being alarmed at mere novelty, to reject any argument or opinion from your mind, but rather weigh it with severe judgment, and, if it seem to you to be just, yield your assent to it;
or, if it be false, gird up your loins to op­ pose it.
For, since the sum of space, abroad beyond these walls of our world, is, as I have proved, infinite, my mind proceeds to make inquiry what there exists farther onwards, in those parts into which the mind perpetually longs to look, and into which the free effort of thought itself earnestly- desires to penetrate.
The first point which I advance is, that in every direction around us, and on all sides, above and below, there is no limit through the whole of space, as I myself have demonstrated, and as truth itself spontaneously proclaims, and the nature of the profound itself makes clear as light.
But by no means can it be thought probable, when infinite space lies open in every quarter, and when seminal-atoms, of incomputable number and unfathomable sum, driven about by everlasting motion, fly through the void in infinite ways, that this one globe of the earth, and this one heaven, have been alone pro­ duced ;
and that those innumerable particles of matter do nothing beyond our sphere;
especially when this world was made by merely natural-causes, and the atoms of things jost­ ling about 1 of their own accord in infinite modes, often brought together confusedly, ineffectually, and to no purpose, at length successfully coalesced;
-at least such of them as, thrown to­ gether suddenly, became in succession2 the beginnings of great things, of the earth, the sea, the heaven, and the race of ani­ mals.
For which reason, it is irresistibly incumbent on you to admit, that there are other combinations of matter in other places, such as is this world, which the ether holds in its vast embrace.
Further, when abundance of matter is ready, and space is at hand, and when no object or cause hinders or delays, things must necessarily be generated 3 and brought into being.
And now, if there is such a vast multitude of seminal-atoms as the whole age of all living creatures would not suffice to number, and if there remains the same force and nature, that can throw together the atoms of things into every part in the same manner as they have been thrown together into this, you must necessarily suppose that there are other orbs of earth in other regions of space, and various races of men and gener­ ations of beasts.
To this is to be added, that in the WHOLE of our world there is no one thing which is produced single, and grows up alone and by itself, but that every thing is of some class, and that there are many individuals in the same kind.
Thus, among animals especially, you will, by your own observation, 4see this to be the case as to the brood of wild beasts that range over the mountains;
you will find the same as to the race of men, male and female ;
1the same, moreover, as to the mute swarms of fishes, and all the kinds of birds.
Wherefore it is to be admitted, that, in like manner, the heaven, and the earth, and the sun, the moon, the sea, and other things which exist, are not single, but rather of infinite number;
since these follow the same general law 2 as other things that arise and decay;
the limit of existence, deeply and unalterably fixed, awaits these parts of nature as well as others, and they consist as much of a natural body, generated but to die, as the whole race of animals which abound, in their several kinds, in this state of things.
Which points if, being well understood, you keep in mind, and reason from them, the system of nature immediately ap­ pears, as a free agent, released from tyrant masters, to do every thing itself of itself spontaneously, without the help of the gods.
For (0 ye sacred bosoms of the deities, that pass in tranquil peace a calm and most serene existence !) who is able to rule the whole of this immense universe?
Who can hold in his hand, with power to guide them, the strong reins of this vast combination of things ?
What god can, at the same time, turn round all the heavens, and warm all the earth with ethereal fires ?
Or what god can be, at the same moment, present in all places, to produce darkness with clouds, and shake the calm regions of heaven with thunder, and then to hurl bolts, and overturn, as often happens, his own temples;
or afterwards, retiring to the desert and uninhabited parts of the earth, to rage there, exercising that weapon with which he often misses the guilty, and kills the innocent and undeserving ?
And after the time when the world was produced, and the natal day of the sea, and the rise of the earth and the sun, atoms were added from without;
seeds, which the vast WHOLE, by agitation, contributed, were conjoined;
whence the sea and the earth had the means of increase, and whence the mansion of the sky amplified its vastness, and raised its lofty vaults far above the earth, and the air rose higher and higher.
For to every body in nature, from all regions of space, are con­ tributed, by the agitation of particles, its own proper atoms, and they betake themselves severally to their own kinds of mat­ ter;
the particles oj moisture pass to water;
the earth is in­ creased with atoms of earth;
and the fiery-principles produce fire, and the aerial air;
until, as such operations proceeded, nature, the perfectress and parent of the world, brought all things to the utmost limit of growth;
as happens when that which is received into the vital passages, is no more in quan­ tity than that which flows away and passes off.
In these cir­ cumstances, the age and growth of all beings 1 must be at a stand;
here nature, by her own influence, restrains further increase.
For whatsoever creatures you see enlarge themselves to a full and lively bulk, and climb, by degrees, the steps to a mature age, receive into themselves more atoms than they emit;
whilst the nourishment is readily distributed through the veins, and whilst their bodies are not so widely dilated 2 as to expel many, that is, a disproportionate number of particles, and to cause the waste to be greater than the food on which their life sustains itself.
For certainly we must admit that many atoms flow off and pass away from bodies;
but, till they have reached the highest point of growth, more ought to accrue to them.
From that point, age reduces by degrees their mature force and strength, and melts away and sinks down to its decline.
Since the larger any creature is, at the time when its increase is stopped, and the greater is its extent of surface, the more atoms it disperses,3 and emits from itself, in all directions around;
nor is the whole of its food readily distributed through its veins;
nor is there sufficient nourish­ ment generatedfrom the food, in proportion to the effluvia which the body discharges,4 whence as much support as is necessary can arise and be supplied to it,1 and whence nature can recruit what is requisite.
Bodies, therefore, naturally decay, as they are wasted by their substance passing off, and as all things yield to external attacks ;
for food at last fails to support ad­ vanced age;
and hostile atoms, striking externally, cease not to exhaust every creature, and subdue it with assaults.
So likewise the walls of the great world, being assailed around, shall suffer decay, and fall into mouldering ruins.
For, if things are kept in vigour, it is nourishment that must recruit them all by renewal;
and it is nourishment that must support, nourishment that must sustain all.
But it is in vain to expect that this frame of the world will last for ever ;
for neither do its veins, so to speak, submit to receive what is suf­ ficient for its maintenance, nor does nature minister as much aliment as is needed.
And thus, even now, the age of the world is debilitated, and the earth, which produced all races of creatures, and gave forth, at a birth, vast forms of wild animals, now, being ex­ hausted, scarcely rears a small and degenerate offspring.
The earth, I say, which produced all creatures;
for it was not, as I conceive, a golden chain from above 2 that let down the tribes of mortals from heaven into the fields;
nor did the sea, or the waves that beat the rocks, produce them;
but the same earth, which now nourishes them from her own substance, generated them at first.
Moreover the earth herself, of her own accord, first pro­ duced for mortals rich crops and joyous vineyards;
she her­ self supplied sweet herbs over the abundant pastures, which now scarcely reach-a-fall-growth,3 though assisted and aug- mented by our toil.
We both wear out our oxen and exhaust the strength of our husbandmen, being scarcely supplied with fruits from our slowly-yielding fields.
To such a degree do the productions of the earth decline, and increase only with human labour.
And in these days the sturdy ploughman, shaking his head, sighs that his great toil has too often fallen out in vain;
and, when he compares the present times to the times past, frequently praises the good-fortune of his fore­ father.
The planter of the degenerate vine, also, sad and fatigued, accuses the progress of time, and wearies heaven with prayers for better seasons;
and often remarks how the an­ cient race of men, full of piety, spent their lives happilyl within narrow limits, when the portion of land, cultivated formerly by each individual, was much less than at present;
nor does his untaught mind understand that all things, exhausted by a long course of time, gradually waste away and pass to their grave.
Having, in the first two books, treated of the nature and qualities of atoms, Lucretius proceeds, in the four following books, to speak of what is formed from those atoms.
He occupies the third book with a description of the na­ ture of the mind and the soul, commencing (ver. 1—13) with a eulogy on Epicurus, who taught that the world was formed, not by any divine power, but from a fortuitous concourse of atoms, and who succeeded, beyond any other philosopher, in relieving the minds of men from the fear of the gods, of death, and of torments after death, ver. 14—40.
Many who pretend to be free from this fear, are still disquieted with it;
and it is often the source of crimes, ver. 41—93.
He then shows that the mind and soul are a part of man, not less than the hand or foot, and not a mere harmony of the parts of the body, as some philosophers taught, ver. 94—106.
Reasons on the separate affections of the body and mind, on sleep, on corporeal mutila­ tions, and on.
the cessation of breathing, ver. 107—137.
Uses the terms mind and soul indiscriminately, yet shows that the mind (animus)is the chief part, residing in the middle of the breast, the soul (anima) being diffused throughout the body, and under the direction of the mind, ver. 138—161.
That this mind, and soul, are corporeal, acting on the body by material impact, and consisting of minute atoms, imperceptible to the senses, ver. 161—231.
That the substance of the soul and mind is not simple, but composed of four subtle consistences, heat, air, aura, and a fourth, to which no name is given, ver. 232—323.
That the soul and body cannot be separated without destruction to both;
and that the sentient power is not confined to the soul, ver. 324—370.
He then refutes the opinion of Democritus, who thought that the soul and body had corre­ spondent parts, ver. 371—396.
Shows that the preservation of life depends more on the mind than on the soul, ver. 397—417.
Afterwards he demon­ strates, by twenty strict arguments, and six additional observations, that the soul perishes with the body, ridiculing, by the way, the Pythagorean transmigration, ver. 418—841.
Hence heobserves, that, as death is the end of man, nothing is to be feared after it;
that it cannot be in itself an evil, because the dead can regret nothing that they have left;
and that prolongation of life is not to be desired, as it would furnish nothing but what has been already enjoyed, ver. 842—988. Says that all the Tarta­ rean sufferings which are dreaded after death, are witnessed and endured in life, ver. 989—1036.
Consoles mankind, by observing that the best men have died as well as the worst, and exhorts them to contemplate death with reason and calmness, ver. 1037—1088.
Concludes with a few more moral reflections to the same purpose, ver. 1089—1107.
O thou, who, from so great darkness, wast first able to raise so effulgent a light, shedding-a-lustre-on the blessings of life, thee, 0 glory of the Greek nation, I follow, and now place the steps of my feet formed upon thy impressed traces, 1 yet not becauseI am so eager to rival, as because, from the love which Ifeel for thee, I desire to imitate thee.
For why should the swallow contend with swans ?
Or what, that is all similar, can kids, with trembling limbs, and the strong vigour of the horse, perform in the race?
Thou, 0 father, art the dis­ coverer of truths ;
2 thou supplies!
to us paternal precepts, and from thy writings, 0 illustrious teacher, as bees gather 3 from all blossoms in the flowery glades, so we feed upon thy golden words;
golden, I say, and most worthy of perpetual existence.
For as soon as thy system of philosophy began to proclaim aloud the NATURE OF THINGS, as it arose in thy divine intel­ lect, 4the terrors of the mind disperse;
the walls of the world open ;
I see things conducted throughout the mighty void of space;
the calm divinity of the gods 5 appears, and their tran­ quil abodes, which neither winds disturb, nor clouds sprinkle with showers, nor snow falling white, congealed with sharp frost, inconveniences ;
6 but the pure air is always cloudless, and smiles with widely effulgent light.
7
To them, moreover, nature supplies all things, nor does any cause, at any time, diminish the tranquillity of their minds.
But the regions of Acheron) on the other hand, are no where apparent;
nor does the dark earth hinder but th at all things, whatever are done beneath our feet throughout the void, may be seen and con­ templated.
Under the influence of these wonders disclosed there, a certain divine pleasure and dread penetrates me;
amazed that nature, thus manifestly displayed by thy power, has been in all parts revealed to us.
And since I have shown 1 of what kind the primordial atoms of all things are, and how, differing in their various forms, and actuated by motion from all eternity, they fly through the void of space of their own accord ;
2 and since I have also de­ monstrated by what means all individual things may be pro­ duced from them ;
the nature of the MIND and of the SOUL now seems, next to these subjects, proper to be illustrated in my verses;
and there must be driven utterly from our minds 3 that fear of Acheron, which disturbs human life from its very foundation, suffusing all things with the blackness of death, nor allows any pleasure to be pure and uncontaminated.
For as to what men often say, that diseases, and a life of infamy, are more to be feared than Tartarus, the successor of death;
and that they know the consistence of the soul to be of the nature of blood, or even of breath, (if their inclination happen to lead them to such an opinion,) and have no need at all of our reasoning and instruction;
you may perceive, for the reasons that follow, 4 that all these observations are thrown out more for the sake of praise and vain-glory, than because the belief itself is settled in their minds;
for the very same boasters, exiled from their country, and driven far from the sight of men, disgraced with foul guilt, and afflicted with all calamities, yet still continue to live;
and whithersoever, notwithstanding, the unhappy men have come, they offer sa­ crifices to the dead, as if their souls were still in existence, and immolate black cattle, and send oblations to the Dii Manes, and, in their calamitous circumstances, apply their minds much more zealously to religion than before.
For which rea­ son, it is more satisfactory to contemplate a person, in order to judge of his character, in doubtful dangers, and to learn what he is in adverse circumstances;
since words of truth are then at last elicited from the bottom of the heart, and the mask is taken away, while the reality of the manremains.
Furthermore, avarice, and the blind desire of honours, which drive men to transgress the bounds of right, and some­ times, as the accomplices and ministers of crimes, to strive night and day, with excessive labour, to rise to the height of power;
these passions, I say, which are the wounds and plagues of life, are nourished for the most part by the dread of death.
For, in general, infamous contempt, and sharp po­ verty, seem removed from a pleasing and secure state of life, and seem to dwell, as it were, before the very gates of de­ struction.
From which cause, while men, not submitting to die to avoid those evils, but restrained by a false terror of death and its consequences, wish that they may escape far, and re­ move themselves to a distance, from disgrace and want, they increase their property with civil bloodshed, and greedily double their riches, heaping slaughter on slaughter;
they cruelly re­ joice at the sad end of a brother, and hate and dread the tables1 of their relations.
From the same terror,2 in like manner, envy often wastes men away;
they grieve that he who walks before them in shining honour, should be powerful, should be looked upon with respect;
they complain that they themselves are tossed about in obscurity and dishonour.
3
Some pine to death for the sake of statues and a name, and often to such a degree from the fear of death, does the hatred of life, and of seeing the light, affect men, that with a despairing mind, they com­ mit self-murder;
4 forgetting that this fear is the source of all cares;
1 that this violates modesty, that this bursts the bonds of friendship ;
this, in fine, prompts mortals to overthrow piety and virtue.
For men have often betrayed their country, and their dear parents, while seeking to avoid the regions of Acheron.
Since as children tremble,2 and fear every thing in thick darkness, so we, in the light, fear sometimes things which are not more to be feared than those which children dread, and imagine about to happen, in the dark.
This terror of the mind, therefore, it is not the rays of the sun, or the bright arrows of day, that must dispel, but the contemplation of nature, and the exercise of reason.
First, then, I say, that the mind, 3 which we often call the intellect, in which is placed the conduct and government of life, is not less an integral part of man himself than the hand, and foot, and eyes, are portions of the whole animal.
Although, indeed, a great number of philosophers have * * * * * thought that the sense of the mind is not placed in any cer­ tain part, but is a kind of vital habit or resulting power of the body, (called by the Greeks a harmony,) 1 which causes us to live endowed with a mental sense, though the mind is situate in no particular part of us.
As, frequently, when good health is said to be a sensation of the body, and yet this health is itself no portion of the person that enjoys health;
so those philosophers place the sense of the mind in no particular part of the person.
In which hypothesis they seem to wander far astray.
For frequently the body, which is openly seen, is diseased and dejected, while we nevertheless feel pleasure2 in the other part, which is hid within us;
and on the other hand again, it often happens that the reverse is the case, when he who is wretched in mind is well in his whole body;
just in the same way as if, when the foot of a sick man is pained, his head, in the mean time, happen to be in no pain at all.
Besides, when the limbs are resigned to gentle sleep, and the body, heavy with slumber, lies stretched without sense, there is yet something else within us, which, at that very time, is agitated in diverse ways, and admits into itself all the affec­ tions of joy, and all the empty solicitudes of the heart.
And now, also, that you may befurther convinced that the soul is actually one among our members,3 and is not wont to hold or occupy the body as a harmony,4 it happens in the first place, you may observe, that, even when much 0f the body is taken away, the life nevertheless often remains in the mem­ bers that are left;
1 and, again, the same life, when a few atoms of the heat of the body have dispersed, and air has been sent forth through the mouth, immediately quits the veins, and relinquishes possession of the bones:
so that you may conclude from hence, that all particles of the body have not equal parts and powers, but that those which are the constituent-atoms of air and quickening heat,2 exercise more influence than others that life may dwell and be retained in the members.
The vital heat, therefore, and air, which desert our limbs when dying, are existent in the body itself, and form a part of it.
For which reason, since the nature of the mind and the soul is thus found to exist as a part of man, give back to these philosophers their name of harmony, whether brought down by musicians from lofty Helicon, or whether they themselves took it from any other quarter, 3 and transferred it to that object, which then wanted a distinctive appellation.
What­ soever is the case, let them have it to themselves;
listen thou to the rest of my arguments.
I now affirm that the mind and soul.
are held united with one another, and form of themselves one nature or substance;
but that that which is as it were the head, and which rules in the whole body, is the reason, the thinking or intellectual part which we call mind and understanding;
and this remains seated in the middle portion of the breast.
For here dread and terror throb;
around these parts joys soothe;
here therefore is the understanding and mind.
The other part of the soul, or vital power, distributed through the whole body, obeys, and is moved according to the will and impulse of the mind.
And this rational or intellectual part thinks of itself alone, and rejoices for itself, at times when nothing of the kind moves either the rest of the soul or the body.
And as when the head or the eye, when pain affects it, is troubled in us, and as part of us, but we are not afflicted throughout the whole body, so the mind is some­ times grieved itself alone, and is sometimes excited with joy, when the other part of the soul, diffused through the limbs and joints, is stimulated by no new sensation.
But when the mind is more than ordinarily shaken by violent terror, we see the whole soul, throughout the several members, sympathize with it, and perspirations and paleness, in consequence, arise over the whole body, and the tongue rendered powerless and the voice die away;
while, we find the eyes darkened, the ears ringing, and the limbs sinking underneath.
Furthermore, we often see men faint altogether from terror of mind;
so that any one may easily understand from this, that with the mind is united the soul, which, when it has been acted upon by the power of the mind, then influences and affects the body.
This same course of reasoning teaches us that the nature or substance of the mind and soul is corporeal ;
1 for when this nature or substance is seen to impel the limbs, to rouse the body from sleep, and to change the countenance, and to guide and turn about the whole man ;
—of which effects we see that none can be produced without touch, and that touch, moreover, cannot take place without body ;
-must we not ad­ mit that the mind and soul are of a corporeal nature ?
Besides, you see that the mind suffers with the body, 1 and sympathizes for us with the body.
Thus, if the violent force of a dart, driven into the body, the bones and nerves being di­ vided, does not hurt the life itself, yet there follows a languor, and a kind of agreeable inclination-to-sink to the ground,2 and when we are on the ground, a perturbation3 and giddiness which is produced in the mind, and sometimes, as it were, an irresolute desire to rise.
It therefore necessarily follows that the nature of the mind is corporeal, since it is made to suffer by corporeal weapons and violence.
I shall now proceed to give you a demonstration, in plain words, of what substance this mind is, and of what it consists.
In the first place, I say that it is extremely subtle, 4 and is formed of very minute atoms.
And you may, if you please, give me your attention, in order that you may understand clearly that this is so, from the following arguments.
5
No­ thing is seen to be done in so swift a way,6 as if the mind pro- poses it to be done, and itself undertakes it.
The mind, therefore, impels itself more speedily than any thing, among all those of which the nature is manifestly seen before our eyes.
But that which is so exceedingly active, must consist of atoms exquisitely round and exquisitely minute;
that they may be moved, when acted on, by a slight impulse.
For water is moved, and flows, with so trifling a force as we see act upon it, inasmuch -as it is composed of voluble and small particles.
But the substance of honey, on the other hand, is more dense, and its fluid sluggish, and its movement more tardy ;
1 for its whole mass of material-particles clings more closely together;
because, as is evident, it consists of atoms neither so smooth, nor so small and round.
For a gentle and light breeze can make a tall heap of poppy-seed waste away, from the top to the bottom, before your eyes;
but, on the con­ trary, can have no such effect upon a heap of stones and darts;
particles, therefore, according as they are most diminutive2 and most smooth, have also the greatest facility of motion.
But, on the other hand, whatever particles are found of a greater weight, and rougher surface, are so much the more fixed and difficult to move.
Since, therefore, the nature of the mind has been found pre- eminently active, it must of necessity consist of particles ex­ ceedingly diminutive, and smooth, and round.
Which point, being thus known to you, my excellent friend, will be found useful, and be of advantage, in many of your future in­ quiries.
This fact also indicates the nature of the soul, and shows of how subtle a texture it consists, and in how small a space it would contain itself, if it could be condensed;
because, when the tranquil repose of death has taken possession of a man, and the substance of the mind and the soul has departed, you can there perceive nothing detracted as to appearance, nothing as to weight, from the whole body.
Death leaves all things entire, 1 except vital sense and quickening heat.
2It must therefore necessarily be the case, that the whole soul consists of extremely small seminal-atoms, connected and diffused throughout the veins, the viscera, and the nerves;
inasmuch as, when the whole of it has departed from the whole of the body, the extreme outline of the members still shows itself unaltered, nor is an atom of weight withdrawn ;
3 just as is the case when the aroma of wine has flown off, or when the sweet odour of ointment has passed away into the air, or when the flavour has departed from any savoury sub­ stance 4 for still the substance itself does not, on that account, appear diminished to the eye, nor does any thing seem to have been deducted from the weight;
evidently because many and minute atoms compose the flavour and odour throughout the whole constitution of bodies.
Wherefore again and again I say, you may feel assured that the nature or substance of the mind and soul is produced from exquisitely small seminal-atoms, since, when it escapes from the body, it carries away no weight with it.
Nor yet is this nature or substance to be regarded by us as simple and uncompounded.
For a certain subtle aura,5 mixed with heat, leaves dying persons;
the heat, moreover, carries ,air with it;
nor is there any heat with which air is not also mixed;
since, as its substance is rare, many atoms of air must necessarily be borne with it.
The substance of the mind is now therefore found to be triple.
Nor yet are all these constituent parts, aura, heat, and air, sufficient to produce mental sense or power;
since the mind admits none of these to be able to generate sensible motions, such as revolve any thoughts in the mind.
A certain fourth nature, or suhstance,1 must therefore necessarily be added to these;
this is wholly without a name;
it is a sub­ stance, however, than which nothing exists more active or more subtle, nor is any thing more essentially composed of small and smooth elementary particles;
and it is this substance which first distributes sensible motions through the members.
For, being formed of small atoms, it is itself first excited;
then the heat, and the secret power of the aura, receive motion from it;
next the air, and afterwards all parts, are quick­ ened ;
the blood is agitated, and all the viscera partake-in-the- sensation ;
and (whether it be pleasure, or whether it be the contrary feeling) it is communicated to the bones and marrow last of all.
Nor can pain easily penetrate, or any violent evil spread, so far as this, without all parts being perturbed:
so that, in such a case, room is wanting for life, and the particles of the soul fly off through all the passages of the body.
But on the surface of the body, as it were, a limit is generally put to sensible motions;
and from this cause we have the power to retain life within us.
And now, though I would fain give a full exposition, in what manner these principles are mixed one with another, and.
how, being arranged, they possess vigour, the poverty of my native tongue restrains me against my will;
but notwith­ standing, as far as I shall be able to treat of these subjects summarily, I will touch upon them.
For the primordial-atoms, by the motion of the elements among themselves, so actively-intermingle in the substance of the soul, that no one can be separated from the rest, nor can their power become divided by any interval, but, being many, they are, as it were, the power of a single body.
As, in the herd of animals, whichsoever you would inspect, 1 there is a certain odour, and heat, and taste;
and still from all these is composed one mass and combination of body.
So heat, and air, and the secret power of aura, and that other active force, (which communicates the beginning of motion from itself to the other three, whence a sensible movement first arises through the viscera,2) being mixed, produce one nature or sub­ stance.
For this fourth principle lies entirely hid, and re­ mains in secret, within;
nor is any thing more deeply seated within our body;
and it is itself, moreover, the soul of the whole soul.
As the force of the mind, and the power of the soul, mixed up with our limbs and entire body, remains latent, because it is composed of small and few atoms, so this name­ less force, compounded of small particles, lies concealed, and is besides, as it were, the very soul of the whole soul, and rules throughout the whole body.
In like manner, it must be the case that the aura, and air, and heat, mixed throughout the limbs, possess-their-vigour one with another;
and that one may possibly subside at times, or become prominent, more than the rest;
but so that they may still seem to be one prin­ ciple compounded of them all;
and that the heat and aura by themselves, or the power of air by itself, may not, being se­ parated from the whole, destroy and dissipate the sense.
There is also that heat in the mind, which it assumes in anger, when it burns, and ardour gleams vividly from the eyes.
There is also much cold aura, the attendant of fear, with which it produces shivering throughout the various mem­ bers, and agitates the limbs.
There is also that state of the air when at rest, which happens in concurrence with a tranquil breast and serene countenance.
But in those animals, whose fierce hearts, and angry feelings, easily burn in wrath, there is more heat;
in which class especially is the violent fury of lions, which, raging, often burst, as it were, their hearts with roaring, nor can contain within their breasts their torrents of ire.
But the cold temperament of deer has more of the aura in it, and sooner excites a chill influence through the viscera, which cause a tremulous motion to arise in the limbs.
But the nature of the ox subsists more on calm air, nor does the smoky torch of wrath, applied to him,1 ever irritate him to fury like that of the lion, suffusing him with a shade of thick darkness ;
2 nor is he torpid, transfixed with the cold darts of aura;
but is situate between the two natures, those of deer and fiercer lions.
Thus is the race of men.
Each has a certain temperament;
and though instruction may in a manner render some in­ dividuals polished, it still leaves the first traces of the nature of every mind;
nor is it to be thought that vices can be so plucked out by the root, but that one man will run more readily than another into violent anger;
a second will be af­ fected somewhat sooner than another by fear;
while a third will regard certain things more indulgently than is right.
And in many other respects the various natures, and yielding man­ ners of men, must necessarily differ;
of which differences I cannot now explain the secret causes, nor find so many names for figures as there are diversities of shape in the atoms from which this variety in things arises.
But, with reference to these subjects, I think myself compe­ tent to affirm this ;
that so small are the traces left of the natural principles, which reason cannot remove3 by her dictates, that nothing hinders men from leading a life worthy of the gods.
This mental nature, therefore, 1 or compound intellectual substance, is contained in every body, and is itself the guardian of the body, and the cause of its safety;
for the two, the body and soul, cohere, as it were, by common roots, with one another, nor seem capable of being torn asunder without destruction to both.
For as it is impossible to separate the perfume from balls of frankincense, without the nature of it, at the same time, being destroyed, so it is impossible to ex­ tract the nature or substance of the mind and soul from the whole body, without all parts being dissolved;
with such closely interwoven elements, from their first origin, are they endowed with common life;
nor does the power of the body or mind seem capable of having-perception apart, each for it­ self, without the vigour of the other;
but the sentient-power lighted up through our viscera is conjointly-produced by their common motions one with the other.
2Besides, the body is never produced,3 nor ever grows, by itself;
nor is it observed to retain-its-existence after death, or the departure of the soul from it.
For it is net as when the liquid-substance of water frequently throws off heat, which has been communicated to it, nor is on that account dispersed itself ;
-not so, I say, can the limbs, when deserted by the soul, bear the separation of the soul from them, but, thus divided from it, altogether perish and rot.
For the mutual inter-con­ nexions of the soul and the corporeal frame, from the very be­ ginning of life, even in the body and secret womb of the mother, so acquire the vital movements together, that a separation cannot take place without destruction and damage to each ;
so that you may see that, since their means of preservation are united, the nature and substance of them must also be united.
For what remains to be considered, if any one denies that the body has sense, and believes that the soul, mixed with the entire body, takes wholly upon itself that motion which we call sense;
he contends against manifest and certain facts.
For who will ever explain what it is for the body to have sense, if it be not that which experience itself has manifestly shown and taught us ?
But the soul being set free from the body, the body is void of sense in all parts:
for it loses that which was not peculiar to itself in any period of its life;
and it besides loses many things as the soul is-being-expelled by age.
1
To affirm, moreover, that the eyes2 themselves can see no object, but that the mind merely looks through them as through open doors, is difficult;
when the sense of these eyes leads to a contrary opinion;
for the sense of the eyes draws the mbid,3 and attracts it from within, to the sights or pupils themselves.
While, let it especially be considered, we are often unable to look at bright objects, because our eyes are prevented by their effulgence ;
which is not the case with regard to mere doors;
for mere open doors, where we look through, do not feel any inconvenience.
Besides, if our eyes are only instead of doors the mind, when the eyes are taken out, and the door-posts themselves, so to speak, removed, seems bound to see even more clearly than before.
On these points, you can by no means assume as true1 that which the divine opinibn of the philosopher Democritus.
lays down;
namely, that the several atoms of the body and mind, applied and corresponding each to each, vary and connect the members.
1
For not only are the atoms of the soul much more diminutive than those of which our body and viscera consist, but are also inferior in number, and are distributed thinly, with spaces between them, throughout the limbs;
se that you may safely warrant that the primary particles of the soul occupy, and are distributed at those intervals only, at which corporeal atoms cast upon us, and striking against us may, if of sufficient gravity, be able to excite sensible motions through the body, the concussions being communicated from the surface to the internal parts.
For neither at times do we perceive the adhesion of dust on the body, nor feel powdered chalk, shaken over the limbs, settle on them;
nor do we feel a mist at night, nor the subtle threads of the spider's web meeting us, when we are entangled in them as we go along;
nor do we notice the old vesture of the same spider fall upon our head, nor feathers of birds, or the flying down of thistles, which, from extreme lightness, generally fall with difficulty.
and strike but gently the object on which they fall;
nor do we observe the progress of every creeping animal, nor every first step of the feet, which gnats and other such insects place upon our body;
so many particles in us must be moved, before the primordial-atoms of the soul, mixed throughout the limbs in our bodies, can feel-the-sensation, and, impelling one another, (at how great intervals!) can, in succession, strike together, meet, and rebound.
And the mind is more efficient in holding the bars of life,3 and more prevalent to preserve vitality;
than the power of the soul.
For without the understanding and mind no part of the soul can have-its-residence in the body even for a small portion of time;
but when the mind takes its departure, the soul readily follows as its companion, and leaves the chilled limbs in the cold of death.
But he to whom understanding and mind have remained, continues in life, although he be mutilated, with his limbs even cut off on all sides.
The trunk.
though portions of the soul be taken away around it, and it be separated from the limbs, still lives, and inhales the vital air;
­ deprived, if not altogether, yet in a great measure, of the soul, it still delays and continues in life.
So when the eye is la­ cerated round about, if the pupil has remained uninjured, the vivid faculty of seeing survives;
but this is only provided you do not injure the entire ball of the eye, but merely cut round the pupil, and leave that alone whole;
for such injury cannot be committed without destruction of the eyes;
but, if the very smallest part of the middle of the ball is perforated, though the bright orb be otherwise unharmed, the sight is at once lost, and darkness follows.
With such a connexion the soul and the mind are constantly united.
And now attend.
That thou mayest understand 1 that living creatures have minds, and subtle souls, BORN and PERISHABLE, I will proceed to arrange verses worthy of thy life and vir­ tues, 2 verses collected during a long time, and prepared with sweet labour.
And thou, my friend, take care to include both of them under one name, whichsoever of the two I may use;
and, for example, when I proceed to speak of the soul, teaching that it is mortal, suppose that I also speak of the mind;
inasmuch as they are one by mutual combination, and their substance is united.
In the first place, since I have shown1 that the soul, being subtle, consists of minute particles, and is composed of much smaller atoms than the clear fluid of water, or mist, or smoke;
(for it far surpasses those bodies in susceptibility-of-motion, and is more readily impelled when acted upon from a slight cause;
inasmuch as both the mind and soul are moved by the mere images of smoke and mist;
2 as when, lulled in sleep, we see high altars exhale with vapour, and carry up smoke;
since doubtless these phantasms are produced in us ;
) 3 now, therefore, 1 say, since, when vessels are broken to pieces.
you see water flow about, and any other liquid run away;
and since, also, mist and smoke disperse into the air;
you must conclude that the soul is likewise scattered abroad, and is dissipated much sooner than mist and smoke, and more easily resolved into its original elements, when it has once been withdrawn from the body of a man, and has taken its depar­ ture.
For how can you believe that this soul can be held together by any combination of air, when the body itself (which is, as it were, its vessel) cannot contain it, if it be convulsed by any violence, or rendered thin and weak by blood being taken from the veins ?
How can that air which is more rare than our body confine it ?
Besides, we observe that the mind is produced' together with the body, and grows up along with it, and waxes old at the same time with it.
For as children wander and totter about with a weak and tender body, so the subtle sense of the mind follows and corresponds to the weakness of their frame.
Then, when their age has grown up in robust vigour, their understanding is also greater, and their strength of mind more enlarged.
Afterwards, when the body is shaken by the prevailing power of time, and, the strength being depressed, the limbs have sunk into infirmity, the understanding then halts, the tongue and the mind lose their sense, all parts fail and fade away at once.
It is therefore natural that the whole substance of the soul should be dissolved, as smoke, into the sublime air of heaven ;
since we see that it is produced toge­ ther with the body, and grows up together with it, and both, as I have shown, overcome by age, decay in concert.
To this is added,2 that as we observe the body itself to- be-subject-to violent diseases and severe pain, so we see the mind to be susceptible of sharp cares, and grief, and fear.
For which cause it is reasonable that it should also be a par­ taker of death.
Moreover the mind, in diseases of the body, often wanders distracted ;
for it loses its faculties, and utters senseless words;
and sometimes, by a heavy lethargy, is borne down into a deep and eternal sleep, the eyes and the nodding-head sink­ ing ;
1 hence it neither hears the voice, nor can distinguish the countenances, of those who stand around recalling it to life, bedewing their faces and cheeks with tears.
Wherefore you must necessarily admit that the mind is also dissolved, since the contagion of disease penetrates into it.
For pain and disease are each the fabricator of death;
a truth.
which we have been taught by the destruction of many millions in past times.
Further, when the violent power of wine has penetrated the heart of men, and its heat, being distributed, has spread into the veins, a heaviness of the limbs follows, the legs of the tottering person are impeded, the tongue grows torpid, the mind is, as it were, drowned;
the eyes swim ;
noise, hiccups,3 and quarrels arise, and other things of this kind, whatever are consequent on intoxication.
Why do these effects happen, unless because the vehement force of the wine has exerted­ its-customary-power to disturb the soul as it is diffused through the body itself?
But whatsoever things can be thus disturbed and obstructed in their operations, show, that if a cause somewhat stronger shall spread within them, the conse­ quence will be that they must perish, deprived of all future existence.
Moreover, frequently, overcome by the force of disease,4 a person suddenly falls down before our eyes, as if struck by the blow of a thunder-bolt, and foams at the mouth, groans, and trembles in his joints, loses his senses, stretches his nerves to rigidity, is distorted, pants with irregular breathing, and wearies his limbs with tossing about;
evidently because the violence of the malady, dispersed throughout the body, and acting upon the soul, perturbs it, as the waves, on the foaming salt ocean, boil with the strong fury of the winds.
Groans are then forced but, because the limbs are seized with pain, and especially because the particles of the voice are drawn forth, and carried, collected in a body, out of the mouth, the may by which they have, as it were, been accustomed to pass, and where the course of the road is paved for them.
1
Loss of understand­ ing takes place, because the united power of the mind and soul is disturbed, and, as I have shown, is divided and rent asunder, distracted by that same distemper.
Afterwards, when the cause of the disease has given way, and the violent humour of the disordered body has retired into its, hiding-place, then, as if staggering, the person first rises, and, by degrees, returns to all his senses, and re-possesses the right state of his soul.
When these substances, therefore, the mind and the soul, are shaken with such powerful diseases in the body itself, and suffer, distracted in such miserable ways, why do you conceive that the same mind and soul can support an existence with­ out a body, in the open air, and amidst strong winds ?
And since we see that the mind may be healed,2 like a sick body, and wrought upon by means of medicine, this also sig­ nifies that the mind exists only as a mortal substance.
For whoever attempts, and commences, to change the mind, or to alter any other nature or substance 3 whatsoever, it is requi­ site either that he add new parts, or transpose the parts in a new order, or take away at least some small portion from the whole.
But any substance, which is immortal, neither allows its parts to be transposed, nor to-be-increased-by-addition, nor permits an atom to pass away from them.
For whatever, being changed, goes beyond1 its own limits, this change is forthwith the death or termination of that which it was before.
The mind, therefore, whether it be diseased, or whether it be wrought upon by medicine, exhibits, as I have demonstrated, mortal symptoms:
so far is the force of true reason seen to oppose false 2 reasoning, and to cut off escape from him who shrinks from its conclusions, and to overthrow what is wrong by a double refutation.
Furthermore, we often see a man decay by degrees,3 and lose his vital power in one limb after another.
On the feet we observe the toes and nails first grow livid;
then the feet themselves and the legs mortify;
afterwards, throughout the other limbs, we perceive the traces of cold death thence pro­ ceed step by step.
4
And since the substance of the soul is thus divided, and does not continue, always and at the same time, entire and unimpaired, it must be deemed mortal.
But if perchance you think that the soul can itself contract itself internally throughout the limbs, and condense its parts into one place, and thus withdraw feeling from all the members successively, yet, in such a case, that place in which so great a mass of soul is collected, ought to seem in possession of greater feeling.
But since this place of such increased feel­ ing is no where apparent, the soul, as we said before, is evidently, being separated-into-parts, scattered abroad, and therefore perishes.
Moreover, if we even consent to grant that which is false, and to allow that the soul may be thus concentrated in the bodies of those who leave light and life by dying part after part, you must still confess that the soul is mortal;
for neither is it of any importance whether it perishes, being scattered throughout the air, or loses its sense when drawn together from being dispersed in its several parts, 1 when animation steals away from the whole man more and more on all sides, and less and less of life is every where left.
And as the mind is one single part 2 of a man, and remains fixed in a certain place, as the ears and eyes are, and the other organs of sense, whatsoever govern life;
and as the hand, and the eye or nose, when detached from us, cannot, separately of themselves, have sensation or even existence, for, when cut off, they are in a short time wasted with putrefaction;
so the mind cannot, of itself, exist without the body and the man himself, which body seems to be, as it were, its vessel, or whatsoever else you would imagine to be more closely united with it, since it adheres to the body by connexion.
Further, the animated powers of the body and mind3 are vigorous, and enjoy life, only when joined with one another;
for neither can the nature or substance of the mind, without the body, alone, and of itself, produce vital motions;
nor again, can the body, deprived of the soul, continue its state of existence, and use its faculties.
Just, for example, 1 as the eye itself, torn from its roots, can discern no object apart from the whole body, so the mind or soul seems to have no power in itself;
evidently because when mingled throughout the veins and viscera, throughout the nerves and bones, they are held-in-close-confinement by the whole body, and their primary-particles, not being free, cannot fly asunder to great distances;
consequently, being thus confined, they move with sensitive motions, with which, after death, when cast forth beyond the body into the air of heaven, they cannot move;
for this very reason, that they are not held-confined in a si­ milar manner.
For surely the air forms body and soul,2 if the soul shall be able to keep itself together in the air, and to contain itself for exerting those motions, which it before exercised amidst the nerves, and in the body itself.
On which account, 1 say again and again, you must necessarily admit that when the whole enclosure of the body is dissolved, and the vital breath cast forth, the sentient-existence of the mind and the soul is dissolved;
since there is common cause and like fate to both.
Besides, when the body cannot bear the dissociation3 of the soul, without putrifying with offensive odour, why do you doubt but that the essence of the soul, rising from the depths and innermost part of the body, has passed forth, and has been diffused abroad like smoke ?
and that for this reason the body, decaying with so great a dissolution, has utterly fallen away, because the foundations 1 have been removed from their place, and the spirits pass out through the limbs, and through all the windings of the passages and ducts that are in the body ?
So that you may understand from many considerations, that the nature or substance of the soul, being disparted, has gone out through the members of the body, and that it was disse­ vered within the body itself, before, gliding outwards, it flowed forth into the air of heaven.
Moreover, whilst the soul dwells within the bounds2 of life, it yet frequently, when it has received a shock from some cause, seems to pass away, and presents the appearance that the mind is let loose from the whole body;
and the counte­ nance then seems to become inanimate as at the last hour, and all the relaxed members to fail the languid frame.
Such is the case, when it is said that the mind has been damaged,3 or the vital power has suffered-syncope;
while all is trepidation, and all are anxious to recover the last link of life.
For then all the mind, and power of the soul, are shaken;
and these, it is evident, sink with the body itself;
so that a cause of some­ what greater force may bring them to dissolution.
Why then do you doubt, but that, at the hour of death, the soul driven forth at length, weak and helpless, out of the body, and being in the open air, with its covering removed, can not only not endure throughout all time, but cannot even main­ tain-its-existence for the smallest space whatsoever ?
Nor does any one, when dying, appear to feel 1 his soul go forth entire from his whole body, or come up first to his throat, and to his jaws above it;
but he finds that part of it which is placed in any certain portion of the body, fail and decay in that part;
as he is conscious of the other senses losing-their-power each in its own quarter ;
but if our soul were immortal, it would not so much complain that it suffers dissolution when dying, but would rather rejoice to pass forth abroad, and to leave its covering, as a snake delights to cast its skin, or an old stag its too long antlers.
Again, why are the understanding and faculty2 of the mind never produced in the head, or the feet, or the hands, but re­ main-fixed, in all men alike, in their peculiar seats and defi­ nite quarters, if it be not that certain spots are assigned to each part to be born in, and where each, whatever it be, may preserve-its-existence when born;
and if it be not that such is the case with respect to the whole of the various members, so that there may no where arise an improper arrangement of the parts ?
So invariably, in the operations of nature, does one thing follow another;
nor is fire wont to be produced from rivers, or cold to be generated in fire.
Besides, if the nature of the soul is immortal, and can have-a-sentient-existence,3 when separated from our body, we must consider it, as I suppose, to be endowed with the five senses;
nor in any other way can we represent to our­ selves the infernal souls as wandering on the banks of the Acheron.
Accordingly painters, and the past generations of writers, have introduced in their compositions souls thus en­ dowed with senses.
But neither can the eyes, nor the nos­ trils, nor the hand itself, preserve-existence apart from the soul;
nor can the tongue;
nor can the ears perceive hearing, or even remain-in-being, apart from the soul.
How then can souls be possessed of the five senses, when all the organs of those senses have perished ?
And since we see that the vital sense spreads through the whole body, 1 and that the whole is animated, if, on a sud­ den, any violence shall cut through the body in the middle, so as to sever the two parts asunder, the substance of the soul, also, without doubt, being disunited and divided together with the body, will be dispersed and scattered abroad.
But that which is divided, and separates into any parts, evidently shows that it has not an ever-during nature.
People relate that chariots armed with scythes, warm with promiscuous slaughter, often cut off limbs with such sudden­ ness, that the part which, being severed, has fallen from the body, is seen to quiver on the ground, when, notwithstanding, the mind and spirit of the man, from the quickness of the wound, cannot feel any pain.
And because at the same time, the mind, in the ardour of battle, is given up to action, it pursues fighting and slaughter with the remainder of the body;
nor is one man aware, frequently, in the midst of the horses, that the wheels and amputating scythes have carried away his left hand, which is lost together with its defence, nor is another conscious, while he climbs the wall and presses forward, that his right hand has dropped off.
A third next attempts to rise after having lost his leg, while his dying foot, close by him, moves its toes on the ground.
And the head of a fourth, severed from the warm and living trunk, keeps, while lying on the ground, its look of life and its eyes open, until it has yielded up all remains of the soul within it.
Moreover, if, when the tongue of a serpent vibrates against you, and his tail and long body threaten you, you may feel inclined to cut both tail and body into several parts with your sword, you will see all the parts separately, cut through with the recent wound, writhe about, and sprinkle the earth with blood;
and you will observe the fore part, turning backward, seeking itself, that is, the hinder part of the body, with its mouth, so that, pierced with the burning anguish of the wound, it may seize it with its teeth.
Shall we then say that there are entire souls in all those several parts ?
But from that position it will follow that one living creature had several souls in its single body.
And since this is absurd, we must admit, therefore, that that has been divided which was one with the body;
wherefore both must be thought to be mortal;
since both are equally divided into several portions.
Besides, if the nature of the soul exists imperishable, and is infused into men at their birth, why are we unable to re­ member the period-of-existence previously spent by us, nor retain any traces of past transactions ?
For if the power of the mind is so exceedingly changed, that all remembrance of past things has departed from.
it, that change, as I think, is not far removed from death itself
For which reason you must of necessity acknowledge, that whatever soul previously existed has perished, and that that which exists for the pre­ sent has been produced for the present.
Again, if, after the body is completely formed,2 the vital power of the soul is wont to be introduced into us at the very time when we are born and when we cross the threshold of life, it would not be in accordance with this, that it should seem, as it now seems, to have grown up in the blood itself together with the body, and with its several members;
but it would rather be natural that it should live alone, as in a cage, by itself and for itself;
though in such a manner, that the whole body, by its influence, should abound with sense and vitality.
For which reason, I say again and again, we must neither think that souls are without beginning, nor that they are exempt from the law of death.
For neither must we deem that souls, if infused into us from without, could have been so completely united with our bodies;
(which complete union, on the con­ trary, manifest experience proves to take place;
for the soul is so combined with the body throughout the veins, viscera, nerves, and bones, that even the very teeth have a share of feeling;
as their aching proves, and the acute-pain from cold water, and the cranching of a hard pebble1 suddenly among our food;
) nor, when they are so completely united, does it seem possible for them to come out entire, and to extricate themselves unharmed from all the nerves, and bones, and joints.
But if still, perchance, you think that a soul, infused from without,2 is wont to expand itself through our limbs, yet to admittthis, is only to admit that every man's soul, being spread out with the body, will so much the more certainly perish with it.
For that which is diffused throughout the body, is dissolved with it, and therefore perishes.
Being distributed, then, through all the passages of the body,-as food, when it is distributed through all the members and limbs, is dissolved, and takes of itself another nature, 1_SO the soul and the mind, although, under this supposition, they go whole into the body at first, yet are dissolved, like digested food, in diffusing them­ selves through it, while the particles are distributed, as if through tubes, into all the limbs ;
the particles, I say, of which is formed this substance of the mind, which now rules in our body, and which has been generated, like the new nature of food, from that which lost its consistence when it was spread throughout the limbs.
For which reasons, the nature or substance of the soul seems neither to have been without a natal day, nor to be exempt from death.
Again, whether do any atoms of the soul remain2 in a dead body, or not ?
For if any remain and exist in the body, it will not be possible for the soul to be justly accounted immortal;
since when she took her departure, sce was diminished of some lost particles.
But if, when removed, she fled with all her parts so entire, that she left no atoms of her substance in the body, whence do dead carcasses, when the viscera become pu­ trid, send forth worms ?
And whence does such an abund­ ance of living creatures, void of bones and blood, swarm over the swollen limbs ?
But if, perchance, you think that perfectly-formed souls may be insinuated into those worms from without, and if you suppose that they may pass each into its own body, and yet omit to consider for what cause many thousands of souls should congregate in the place from which one soul has withdrawn, this point, however, which you leave out of consideration, is of such a nature, that it seems especially worthy to be sought into and brought under examination.
It is proper not only to reflect, I say, whether souls hunt for particular atoms of worms, and build for themselves carcasses in which they may dwell, or whether they infuse themselves into bodies already made;
but also to consider that there is no reason to be given 1 why they should make bodies, or why they should labour at all;
for, while they are without a body, they fly about undis­ turbed by diseases, and cold, and hunger;
since it is the body that rather labours under these maladies, (as well as from death,) and the soul suffers all evils from contact with it.
But, nevertheless, let it be as advantageous as you please for these souls to make a body which they may enter, there seems, however, to be no means by which they may make it.
It is fair, therefore, to conclude that souls do not make for them­ selves bodies and limbs.
Nor yet is there a possibility, as it appears, that they can be infused into bodies perfectly-formed;
for neither under that supposition can they be exactly fitted together;
nor will their mutual-motions be carried on with sympathy.
Furthermore, why does violent rage2 attend upon the sullen breed of lions, and craft upon that of foxes;
and why is flight communicated to stags from their sires, and why does hereditary fear add speed to their limbs ?
And as to other qualities of this sort, why do they all generate, in the body and temper­ ament, from the earliest period of life, if it be not because a certain disposition of mind grows up together with each body from its own seed and stock ?
But if the soul were immortal, and were accustomed, as the Pythagoreans think, to change bodies, surely animals would gradually alter, and grow of mixed dispositions;
the dog of Hyrcanian breed would often flee from the assault of the horned stag;
the hawk, flying through the air of heaven, would tremble at the approach of the dove;
men would lose their understanding, and the savage tribes of wild beasts become reasonable.
For that which some assert, namely, that an immortal soul is altered by a change of body, is advanced upon false reason­ ing ;
as that which is altered, loses its consistence, and there­ fore perishes;
since the parts are transposed, and depart from their original arrangement;
wherefore the parts of the soul, under this hypothesis, must also be subject to dissolution throughout the limbs;
so that finally they may all perish to­ gether with the body.
But if they shall say that the souls of men always migrate into human bodies, I shall nevertheless ask, why a soul, from being wise in a wise body, should possibly become foolish in the body of a fool;
why no child is found discreet, or inform­ ed with a soul of mature understanding, and why no foal of a mare is as skilful in his paces as the horse of full vigour ?
why, I say, is this, if it be not because a certain temper of mind grows up with each body from its own seed and stock ?
These philosophers, forsooth, will take refuge in the assertion, 1 that the mind becomes tender in a tender body ;
but if this be the case, you must admit that the soul is mortal, since, being so exceedingly changed in its new body, it loses its former vitality and powers.
Or in what way will the vigour of a soul,2 strengthened in concert with each particular body, be able to reach with it the desired flower of mature age, unless it shall be joined to it in its first origin ?
Or with what motive does the soul go forth from limbs that are grown old ?
Does it fear to remain imprisoned in a decaying-carcass, lest it should decay with it?
Or is it afraid lest its tenement, shaken with a long course of life, should fall and overwhelm it?
But to that which is immortal, there are no such dangers.
Moreover, to imagine that souls stand ready 1 at the amor­ ous intercourses, or parturitions, of beasts, to enter into the young, seems exceedingly ridiculous.
It appears too absurd to suppose that immortal beings, in infinite numbers, should wait for mortal bodies, and contend emulously among them­ selves which shall be first and foremost to enter ;
-unless per­ chance you suppose that agreements have been made among the souls, that the first which shall have come flying to the body, shall have first ingress, and that they may thus have no contest in strength with one another.
Again, neither can a tree exist in the sky,2 nor clouds in the deep sea;
nor can fish live in the fields;
nor blood be in wood, nor liquid in stones.
It is fixed and arranged where every thing may grow and subsist;
thus the nature or sub­ stance of the mind cannot spring up alone without the body, or exist apart from the nerves and the blood.
Whereas if this could happen, the power of the mind might at times rather arise in the head or the shoulders, or the bottom of the heels, and might rather accustom itself to grow in any place, than to re­ main in the same man and in the same receptacle.
3
But since it seems fixed and appointed also in our own body, where the soul and the mind may subsist and grow up by themselves, it is so much the more to be denied that they can endure and be produced out of the entire body.
For which reason, when the body has perished, you must necessarily admit that the soul, which is diffused throughout the body, has perished with it.
Besides, to join the mortal to the immortal, 1 and to suppose that they can sympathize together, and perform mutual opera­ tions, is to think absurdly;
for what can be conceived more at variance with reason, or more inconsistent and irreconcila­ ble in itself, than that that which is mortal, joined to that which is imperishable and eternal, should submit to endure violent storms and troubles in combination with it ?
Further, whatsoever bodies remain eternal, must either, as being of a solid consistence, repel blows, and suffer nothing to penetrate them, that can disunite their compact parts within ;
(such as are the primary-particles of matter, the nature of which we have shown above;
) or they must be able to en­ dure throughout all time, because they are free from blows, or unsusceptible of them ;
(as is a vacuum, which remains in­ tangible, and suffers nothing from a stroke;
) or they must be indestructible for this reason, that there is no sufficiency of space round about, into which their constituent substances may, as it were, separate and be dissolved ;
(as the entire universe is eternal, inasmuch as there is neither any space without it into which its parts may disperse;
nor are there any bodies which may fall upon it, and break it to pieces by a violent concussion:
) but, as I have shown, neither is the nature of the soul of a solid consistence, since with all compound bodies vacuum is mixed;
nor is it like a vacuum itself;
nor, again, are bodies wanting, which, rising fortuitously from the infi­ nite of things, may overturn this frame of the mind with a violent tempest, or bring upon it some other kind of disaster and danger;
nor, moreover, is vastness and profundity of space wanting, into which the substance of the soul may be dispersed, or may otherwise perish and be overwhelmed by any other kind of force.
The gate of death, therefore, is not shut against the mind and soul.
But if perchance the soul, in the opinion of any, is to be accounted immortal the more on this account,3 that it is kept fortified by things preservative of life;
or because objects adverse to its safety do not all approach it;
or because those that do approach, being by some means diverted, retreat be­ fore we can perceive what injury they inflict;
the notion of those who think thus is evidently far removed from just rea­ soning.
For besides that it sickens from diseases of the body, there often happens something to trouble it concerning fu­ ture events, and keep it disquieted in fear, and harass it with cares;
while remorse for faults, from past acts wickedly and foolishly committed, torments and distresses it.
Join to these afflictions the insanity peculiar to the mind, and the oblivion of all things;
and add, besides, that it is often sunk into the black waves of lethargy.
Death, therefore, is nothing, nor at all concerns us, since the nature or substance of the soul is to be accounted mortal.
And as, in past time, we felt no anxiety, when the Cartha­ ginians gathered on all sides to fight with ourforefathers, and when all things under the lofty air of heaven, shaken with the dismaying tumult of war, trembled with dread ;
and men were uncertain to the sway of which power every thing human, by land and by sea, was to fall;
so, when we shall cease to be, when there shall be a separation of the body and soul of which we are conjointly composed, it is certain that to us, who shall not then exist, nothing will by any possibility happen, or ex­ cite our feeling, not even if the earth shall be mingled with the sea, and the sea with the heaven.
And even if the substance of the mind, and the powers of the soul, after they have been separated from our body, still retain-their-faculties, it is nothing to us, who subsist only as being conjointly constituted by an arrangement and union of body and soul together.
Nor, if time should collect our ma­ terial-atoms after death, and restore them again as they are now placed, and the light of life should be given back to us, would it yet at all concern us that this were done, when the recollection of our existence has once been interrupted.
And it is now of no importance to us, in regard to ourselves, what we were before ;
1 nor does any solicitude affect us in reference to those whom a new age shall produce from our matter, should it again be brought together as it is at present.
For when you consider the whole past space of infinite time, and reflect how various are the motions of matter, you may easily believe that our atoms have often been placed in the same order as that in which they now are.
Yet we cannot revive that time in our memory ;
for a pause of life has been thrown between, and all the motions of our atoms2 have wandered hither and thither, far-away from sentient-movements.
For he, among men now living, to whom misery and pain3 are to happen after his death, must himself exist again, in his own identity, at that very time on which the evil which he is to suffer may have power to fall;
but since death, which inter­ rupts all consciousness, and prevents all memory of the past, precludes the possibility of this ;
and since the circumstance of having previously existed, prohibits him who lived before, and with whom these calamities which we suffer might be asso­ dated, from existing a second time, (with any recollection of his other life,) as the same combination of atoms of which we now consist, we may be assured that in death there is nothing to be dreaded by us;
that he who does not exist, cannot be­ come miserable;
and that it makes not the least difference to a man, when immortal death has ended his mortal life, that he was ever born at all.
Whenever, therefore, you see a man express concern that it should be his lot after death either to putrify on the ground when his body is laid aside, or to be destroyed by flames, or by the jaws of wild beasts, you may know that his mind is not in a healthy state, and that some secret disquietude as to his fate is concealed in his breast, although he may himself deny that he believes any consciousness will remain to him after death.
For, as I think, he does not make good what he professes, nor speaks from conviction, from which he pretends to speak ;
1 nor withdraws and removes himself, in thought, wholly out of life, but, foolish as he is, makes something of himself still to survive.
For when any one of such a character represents to himself, while alive, that birds and beasts will tear his body at death, he is seized with commiseration for himself;
for neither does he at all distinguish himself dead from himself living, nor sufficiently withdraw himself from his exposed carcass;
but supposes it to be still himself, and standing by it, in imagination, communicates to it a portion of his own feeling.
Hence he is concerned that he was born mortal, nor reflects that in real death there will remain of him no other self, which, surviving, may mourn for him that he has perished, and, standing upright, may lament that he, lying down, is torn in pieces or burnt to ashes.
For if it is an evil at death, to be ill-treated by the jaws and teeth of wild beasts, I do not see how it can be otherwise than unpleasant for a man, being laid on a funeral-pyre, to burn in hot flames, or, placed in honey, to be suffocated,2 or to grow stiff with cold, when he is lying on the highest flat of a gelid rock, or to be pressed down and overwhelmed with the weight of su­ perincumbent earth."
For now," men say, " your pleasant home shall no more receive you, nor your excellent wife;
nor shall your dear children run to snatch kisses, and touch your breast with secret delight.
You will no more be able to be in flourishing circumstances, and to be a protection to your friends.
Un­ happily, one adverse day has taken from you, unfortunate man, all the numerous blessings of life."
In such remarks they do not add this, " Nor now, moreover, does any regret for those things remain with you."
1
Which truth if men would well consider in their thoughts, and adhere to it in their words, they would relieve themselves from much anxiety and fear of mind. "
You, for your part," says a mourner over a corpse, " laid to sleep in your bed, will so remain as you are for what­ ever time is to come, released from all distressing griefs;
but we, standing near you, shall inconsolably lament you reduced to ashes on the awful pyre;
and no lapse of time shall remove our unfading sorrow from our hearts."
Of him, however, who makes such lamentations, we may ask this question, "If the matter of death is reduced to sleep and rest, what can there be so bitter in it, that any one should pine in eternal grief for the decease of a friend ?
"This also is often a practice among men, that when they have sat down to a feast, and hold their cups in their hands, and overshadow their faces with chaplets, they say seriously and from their hearts, " This enjoyment is but short to us little men;
soon it will have passed;
nor will it ever here­ after be possible to recall it."
As if at their death this evil were to be dreaded above all, that parching thirst should scorch and burn up the wretches, or an insatiable longing for some other thing should settle on them.
Yet how different will be the fact!
Since not even when the mind and body are merely at rest together in sleep, will any one feel concern for himself and his life;
for, for our parts, our sleep might thus be eternal;
nor does any care for ourselves affect us;
and yet, at that sea­ son, the atoms, throughout our limbs, withdraw to no great distance from sensible motions, 2 and the man who is suddenly­ roused from sleep quickly recollects himself.
Death, then, we must consider to be of far less concern to us, if less can be than that which we see to be nothing.
For a greater separation of the atoms of matter takes place in death, nor does any man awake when once the cold pause of life has overtaken him.
Furthermore, if UNIVERSAL NATURE should suddenly utter a voice, and thus herself upbraid any one of us:
"What mighty cause have you, 0 mortal, thus excessively to in­ dulge in bitter grief?
Why do you groan and weep, at the thought of death ?
For if your past and former life has been an object of gratification to you, and all your blessings have not, as if poured into a leaky vessel, flowed away and been lost without pleasure, why do you not, 0 unreasonable man, retire like a guest satisfied with life, and take your undisturbed rest with resignation ?
But if those things, of which you have had the use, have been wasted and lost, and life is offensive to you, why do you seek to incur further trouble,2 which may all again pass away and end in dissatisfaction ?
Why do you not rather put an end to life and anxiety?
For there is nothing further, which I can contrive and discover to please you ;
every thing is always the same.
If your body is not yet withered with years, and your limbs are not worn out and grown feeble, yet all things remain the same, even if you should go on to out­ last all ages in living ;
and still more would you see them the same, if you should never come to die."
What do we answer to this, but that Nature brings a just charge against uUS, and sets forth in her words a true allegation ?
But would she not more justly reproach and upbraid, in se­ vere accents, him who, being miserable unreasonably, deplores death ? "
Away with thy tears, wretch," she might well say, "and forbear thy complaints."
But if he who is older, and more advanced in years, complain, sce may retort thus:
" After having been possessed of all the most valuable things of life, thou pinest and wastest away with age.
But, because thou.
always desirest what is absent, and despisest present ad- vantages, life has passed from thee imperfect and unsatisfactory.
and death has stood by thy head unawares, and before tnou canst depart content and satisfied with thy circumstances.
Now, however, resign all things unsuitable to thy age, and yield at once, with submissive feelings, to that which is stronger than thum;
1 for it is necessary."
And justly, as I think, would she address him;
justly would she upbraid and re­ proach him;
for that which is old, driven out by that which is new, always retires, and it is indispensable to repair one thing out of another;
nor is any man consigned to the gulf of Erebus, or black Tartarus, but allowed to retire peaceably to a dream less sleep.
The matter, of which thou art made, is wanted by nature that succeeding generations may grow up from it;
all which, however, when they have passed their appointed term of life, will follow thee:
and so have other generations, before these, fallen into destruction;
and other generations, not less certainly than thyself, will fall.
Thus shall one thing never cease to rise from another;
and thus is life given to none in possession, but to all only for use.
Consider, also, how utterly unimportant to us was the past antiquity of infinite time, that elapsed before we were born.
This, then, nature exhibits to us as a specimen of the time which will be again after our death.
For what does there appear terrible in it ?
Does any thing seem gloomy ?
Is not all more free from trouble than any sleep ?
And of the souls likewise, whatever are said to be in the profundity of Acheron, all the sufferings happen to ourselves, not in death, but in life.
Tantalus, torpid with vain terror, does not (as it is reported) fear the huge rock impending over him in the air;
but such terror rather dwells with us in life;
a groundless fear of the gods oppresses mortals, and they dread that fall which fortune may assign to each.
Nor do vultures penetrate into Tityus, lying in Hades;
nor, however they might search2 in his huge breast, would they be able to find, through infinite time, any thing to devour, of however vast an extent of body he may be, even though it be such as may cover, with its limbs outspread, not merely nine acres, but the orb of the whole earth ;
nor yet would he be able to endure eternal pain, or to supply food incessantly from his own body;
but HE is a Tityus among us, whom, lying under the influence of love, the vultures of passion tear, and anxious disquietude devours;
or whom cares, with any other unbecoming-feeling, lacerate.
A
Sisyphus, likewise, is before our eyes in life, who sets his heart 1 to solicit from the people the fasces and sharp axes, and always retires repulsed and disappointed.
For to seek power, which is empty, nor is ever granted, and constantly to endure hard labour in the pursuit of it, this is to push with effort the stone up the hill, which yet is rolled down again from the summit, and impetuously seeks the level of the open plain.
To feed perpetually, moreover, an ungrateful nature, and to fill it with good things, and never to satisfy it;
a kindness which the seasons of the year do to us, as they come round in their course, and bring their fruits and various charms;
whilst we, notwithstanding, are never satisfied with the bless­ ings of life;
this is, I think, that which they relate of the damsels in the flower of their youth, that they pour water into a punctured vessel, which, however, can by no means be filled.
But also Cerberus and the Furies are mentioned, and pri­ vation of light, and Tartarus, casting forth fires from its jaws, objects which are no where, nor indeed can be;
but there is, in life, an eminent dread of punishment for enormous crimes;
there is the prison, the reward of guilt, and the terrible preci­ pitation, of those who are condemned, from the rock;
there are stripes, executioners, the wooden-horse,2 pitch, hot iron, fire-brands;
and though these may be absent, yet the mind, conscious of evil deeds, feeling dread in anticipation, applies to itself stings, and tortures itself with scourges, nor sees, in the mean time, what end there can be of its sufferings, nor what can be the limit of its punishment, and fears rather lest these same tortures should become heavier at death.
Hence, in fine, the life of fools becomes, as it were, an existence in Tartarus.
This reflection, likewise, you may at times address to your­ self.
" Even the good Ancus," as Ennius expresses it, " has de­ serted the light with his eyes,”1 who was much better in many things than thou, worthless man Besides, many other kings, and rulers of affairs, who swayed mighty nations, have yielded up the ghost.
And what am I better than they ?
He, even, himself, who formerly paved a road over the vast sea, and afforded a way to his legions to pass through the deep, and taught them to walk on foot through salt gulfs, and despised the murmurs of the ocean, trampling on it with his cavalry;
even he, I say, the light of life being withdrawn from him, poured forth his soul from his dying body.
Scipio, the thunderbolt of war, the dread of Carthage, gave his bones to the earth, just as if he had been the meanest slave.
Add to these, the inventors of the sciences and the graces;
add the associates of the muses;
over whom the unrivalled Homer having obtained the supremacy, has been laid to rest in the same sleep with others.
When mature old age, too, gave Democritus warning that the mindful motions2 of his intellect were languishing, he him­ self, of his own accord, offered his head to death.
Epicurus himself, having run through his light of life,3 is dead;
Epicurus, who excelled the human race in genius, and threw all into the shade, as the ethereal sun, when rising, obscures the stars.
Wilt thou, then, hesitate, and grudge to die, in whom, even while living and seeing, life is almost dead?
Thou, who wastest the greater part of existence in sleep, and snorest waking, nor ceasest to see dreams, and bearest a mind dis­ turbed with empty terror;
nor canst thou, frequently, dis­ cover what evil affects thee, when, stupified and wretched, thou art oppressed with numerous cares on all sides, and, fluctuating with uncertain thought, wanderest in error?
If men could feel, as they seem to feel, that there is an oppression on their minds, which wearies them with its weight, and could also perceive from what causes it arises, and whence so great a mass, as it were, of evil exists in their breasts, they would not live in the manner in which we generally see them living;
for we observe them uncertain what they would have, and always inquiringly something new;
and changing their place, as if by the change they could lay aside a load.
He, who has grown weary of remaining at home, often goes forth from his vast mansion, and suddenly returns, inas­ much as he perceives that he is nothing bettered by being abroad.
He runs precipitately, hurrying on his horses, to his villa, as if he were eager to carry succour to an edifice on fire;
but, as soon as he has touched the threshold of the building, he yawns, or falls heavily to sleep, and seeks for­ getfulness of himself or even with equal haste goes back and revisits the city.
In this way each man flees from himself;
but himself as it always happens, whom he cannot escape, and whom he still hates, adheres to him in spite of his efforts;
and for this rea­ son, that the sick man does not know the cause of his disease, which if every one could understand, he would, in the first place, having laid aside all other pursuits, study to learn the NATURE OF THINGS;
since in such inquiries the state of eter­ nity, not of one hour merely, is concerned;
a state in which the whole age of mortals, whatever remains after death, must continue.
Besides, why does so pernicious and so strong desire of ex­ istence compel us to remain anxious in uncertain perils ?
A certain bound of life is fixed to mortals;
nor can death be avoided, or can we exempt ourselves from undergoing it.
Moreover, we are continually engaged and fixed in the same occupations;
nor, by the prolongation of life, is any new pleasure discovered.
Yet that which we desire, seems, while it is distant in the future, to excel all other objects;
but afterwards, when it has fallen to our lot, we covet some­ thing else;
and thus a uniform thirst of life occupies us, long­ ino, earnestly for that which is to come;
while what fate the last period may bring us, or what chances may throw in our way, or what death awaits us, still remains in uncertainty.
Nor, by protracting life, do we deduct a single moment from the duration of death;
we cannot diminish aught1 from its reign, or cause that we may be for a less period sunk in non-existence.
How many generations soever, therefore, we may pass in life, nevertheless that same eternal death will still await us.
Nor will he be less long out of being,2 who ter­ minated his life under this day's sun, than he who died many months and years ago.
After an exordium, (ver. 1—25,) in which Lucretius speaks of his subject, and his mode of recommending it, he proceeds to treat of the images of Epi­ curus, by which the senses are excited, ver. 26—45.
He shows that images, of exquisite subtlety, are emitted from the surfaces of objects, which are for the most part unseen, but which are observed when reflected from a mirror, or any smooth surface, ver. 46—108.
Besides these images de­ tached from bodies, there are others spontaneously generated in the air, ver. 109—216.
He demonstrates that vision is produced by the impact of images on the eyes, ver. 217—239.
He then solves various questions re­ lating to images in mirrors, and to light and shade, ver. 240—379.
He shows that the senses may be trusted, though some would question their evidence;
and that false opinions arise from false reasoning about the testimony of the senses, ver. 380—469.
Pursues the subject more fully, refuting the Academics, ver. 470—523.
Proceeding to the other senses, he asserts that voice and sounds are of a corporeal substance, and dis­ courses on the nature and formation of the voice, ver. 524—565.
Speaks of the diffusion, reverberation, and penetration of sounds, ver. 566—617.
Treats of taste and odour, and their diversities, ver. 618—724.
Shows that imagination and thought are produced by means of images, which penetrate the body through the senses, ver. 725—759.
Explains the na­ ture of dreams, and why a man thinks of that on which he wishes to think, ver. 760—808.
Shows how we are often deceived by images, ver. 809—823.
Proceeds to prove that the organs of the body were produced before the use of them was discovered;
that they were not designed for use, but that it was found out, after they were formed, that they could be used, ver. 824—878.
That motion in animals arose from the motions of images, ver. 879—908.

I RANGE over the trackless regions1 of the Muses, trodden before by the foot of no poet.
It delights me to approach the untasted fountains, and to drink;
and it transports me to pluck the fresh flowers, and to obtain a distinguished chaplet for my head from those groves whence the Muses have hitherto veiled the temples of no one.
In the first place, because I give instruction concerning mighty things, and proceed to free the mind from the closely-confining shackles of religion;
in the next place, because I compose such lucid verses concern­ ing so obscure a subject, affecting every thing with the grace of poetry.
Since such ornament, also, seems not unjustifiable or without reason.
But as physicians, when they attempt to give bitter wormwood to children, first tinge the rim round the cup with the sweet and yellow liquid of honey, that the age of childhood, as yet unsuspicious, may find the lips de­ luded, and may in the mean time drink of the bitter juice of the wormwood, and, though deceived, may not be injured, but rather, recruited by such a process, may recover strength :
so now I, since this argument seems, in general, too severe and forbidding to those by whom it has not been handled, and since the multitude shrink back from it, was desirous to set forth my chain-of-reasoning to thee, 0 Memmius, in sweetly- speaking Pierian verse, and, as it were, to tinge it with the honey of the Muses;
if perchance, by such a method, I might detain thy attention upon my strains, until thou gainest a knowledge of the whole NATURE OF THINGS, and perceives!
the utility of that knowledge.
But since I have demonstrated2 of what nature the primor- dial-atoms of all things are, and with how different figures distinguished they fly spontaneously1 through space, actuated by motion from all eternity, and in what manner all things may severally be produced from them;
and since I have shown what is the nature of the soul, and from what substances it derives its vigour in-its-connexion with the body, and in what way, being separated from it, it returns to its original elements, I shall now begin to treat of another subject, which is of the greatest concern to these inquiries, namely, that there exist those shapes which we call IMAGES OF THINGS ;
shapes which, being separated, like membranes, from the surface of the bodies of objects, flit hither and thither through the air;
and which same shapes, not only occurring to us when awake, startle our minds, but also alarm us in sleep, when we often seem to behold strange forms and spectres of the dead, that frequently, when we are torpid in slumber, rouse us with horror:
I say that these are images thrown off the bodies oj objects, that we may not, by any possibility, suppose that souls escape from Acheron, or that shades of the dead hover about among the living, or that any portion of us can be left after death, when, after the body, and substance of the soul, have been disunited, they have suffered dissolution into their re­ spective elements.
I affirm, then, that thin shapes and figures of objects are detached from those objects;
from the surface, I mean, of their bodies;
shapes which are to be designated, as it were, their pellicle or bark, because each image bears the likeness and form of that object, whatsoever it be, from whose surface it is detached and seems to wander2 through the air.
This fact any one, with however dull an intellect, may un­ derstand from what follows.
In the first place, since many bodies, among objects manifest before our eyes, send off, when disunited, various particles from their substance, partly diffused and subtle, as wood discharges smoke and fire heat, and partly more close and condensed, as whenever grasshoppers in sum­ mer lay aside their thin coats, and when calves, at their birth, cast the membrane from the surface of their bodies, and, like­ wise, when the slippery snake puts off his garment among the thorns, (for we frequently see the briers gifted with their spoils):
since these things, I say, take place, a thin image may naturally be detached 2 from bodies;
that is to say, from the extreme surface of bodies.
For why those substances which are more dense, should more readily fall away and recede from bodies, than these shapes which are light and subtle, it is quite impossible to tell;
especially when there are number­ less minute particles on the surface of objects, which may be thrown off in the order in which they have lain, and keep the outline of their figure;
and this so much the more easily, as, being comparatively few, and placed on the outmost super­ ficies, they are less liable to be obstructed.
For, assuredly, we not only see many particles discharge themselves, and become detached, as we said before, from the middle and inward parts of bodies,3 but we observe also colour itself frequently fly off from their surfaces;
and this effect yellow, red, and purple curtains4 publicly exhibit, when, stretched across the vast theatres, displayed over the poles and beams, they fluctuate with a tremulous motion;
for they then tinge the assembly on the benches, and the whole face of the scene beneath, the persons of senators, matrons, and gods, and vary them with their own colour;
and the more the walls of the theatre are shut in around, so much the more all these objects within, suffused with the hue of the curtains, (the light of day being affected with it,) smile and look goy.
When the curtains, therefore, send off colour from their surface, all other objects may naturally send off subtle images;
for it is from the superficies that both emit.
There are therefore, we must believe, certain outlines of figures, which, formed of a subtle texture, fly abroad, and which nevertheless cannot, at the time that they are separated from bodies, be individually discerned by the eye.
Besides, if all odour, smoke, vapour, and other similar sub­ stances, fly off from bodies in a scattered manner, it is because, while rising from within, they are, as they issue forth, broken by winding passages;
nor are there any direct openings of the orifices, by which they strive, as they spring up, to fly out.
1
But, on the other hand, when a thin coat of colour from the surface is thrown off, there is nothing that can scat­ ter it, since, being placed on the very superficies, it lies in readiness to fall off unbroken.
Moreover, whatever images appear to us in mirrors, in the water, and in any bright object, their substance, since they are distinguished by a form similar to their objects, must ne­ cessarily consist2 in forms thrown off from those objects.
For why those grosser consistences, as smoke and vapour, which many bodies obviously send forth from their substance, should more readily detach themselves, and recede from objects, than those which are thin and subtle, there is no possibility of tell­ ing.
There are, therefore, we may believe, thin images of the forms of bodies, and unlike those of a grosser nature, which, though no one can see them severally thrown off, yet, being thrown off, and repelled by successive and frequent reflec­ tions3 from the flat surface of mirrors, strike the eye, and pro- duce sight.
Nor can shapes of bodies be imagined, by any other means, to be so accurately preserved, as that forms cor­ responding to each should be represented to us.
Give me now your attention further, and learn of how subtle a nature or substance an image consists.
You may imagine this subtlety, in the first place, inasmuch as the pri­ mordial-atoms of things are so far below our senses, and so ex­ ceedingly less than those smallest objects which our eyes first begin to be unable to distinguish..
But that I may make plain to you how exquisitely diminutive the primary-particles of all bodies are, listen to what I shall state in these few ob­ servations.
First, there are some animals so exceedingly minute, that the third part of them can by no possibility be seen.
2
Of what size can any internal part of these creatures be imagined to be ?
What is the globule of their heart, or of their eye ?
What are their members and joints ?
How extremely dimi­ nutive must they be!
What, moreover, is the size of the several atoms of which their vital-principle, and the sub­ stance of their soul, must necessarily consist ?
Do you not conceive how subtle and minute they must be ?
Contemplate, besides, whatever bodies exhale from their substance a powerful odour, as panacea, bitter wormwood, strong-smelling southern wood, and pungent centaury, any one of which if you shall happen to shake gently, and imagine how small must be the atoms that affect your nostrils, you may then the better understand that numerous images of bodies, composed of still smaller atoms, may flit about in various ways, without force or weight, and without impression on the senses.
1
[Of which bodies how fine a part the image is, there is no one can express, or give the due estimation of it in words.]
But lest perchance you should think, that those images of objects alone wander abroad, which fly off from the objects themselves, there are others, also, which are produced spon­ taneously, and are combined of themselves in this sky which is called the air;
those images, namely, which, fashioned in various shapes, are borne along on high, and, being soft in their contexture, never cease to change their figure, and to metamorphose themselves into the outlines of forms of every sort.
This we sometimes see the clouds do, when we observe them thicken on high, and dim the serene face of the firma­ ment, yet soothing the air, as it were, with their motion ;
2 as, frequently, the faces of giants seem to fly over the heaven, and to spread their shadows far and wide;
sometimes huge mountains, and rocks apparently torn from those mountains, seem now to go before the sun, now to follow close behind him;
then some monster seems to drag forward, and to ob­ trude, other stormy clouds.
Understand, now, with how easy and expeditious a process these images are formed, and perpetually flow off, and pass away from objects.
For there is always on the surface of bodies something redundant, which they may throw off;
and this redundancy, or outside form, when it comes in contact with certain objects, as, for example, a thin garment,3 passes through it;
but, when it strikes against rough rocks, or the substance of wood, is at once broken into fragments, so that it can present no image.
But when objects which are bright and dense have stood in its way, as, above all, a looking-glass, neither of these effects happens;
for neither can images pass through it like a garment, nor be divided into parts before the smooth surface has succeeded in securing its entireness.
1
From this cause it happens that images abound among us;
and, however suddenly, at any time whatsoever, you may place a mirror opposite an object, the image of it appears;
so that you may conclude that filmy textures of objects, and subtle shapes, are perpetually flying off from the superficies of every body.
Many images are therefore carried off in a short space, so that the production of these forms must naturally be thought rapid.
2
And as the sun must send forth many rays in a short time, that all places may be constantly full of light, so, by a like process, many different images of bodies must necessarily be carried off from those bodies in a moment of time in all direc­ tions round about;
since, whatsoever way we turn the mirror to the figures of objects, the objects are represented in it of a correspondent form and colour.
Besides, at times when the state of the sky has just before been clear as possible, it becomes, with extreme suddenness, so frightfully overclouded on all sides, that you might think that all the darkness had left Acheron, and filled the immense vault of heaven ;
so formidably, when such a gloomy night of clouds has arisen, does the face of black terror hang over the earth from above.
Of which clouds, thin as they are, how thin a portion their image must be, as viewed in a reflecting surface, there is no man that can express, or give in words such an estimation as would be conceivable.
And now attend further, and with how swift a motion images are borne along, and what activity is given to them as they swim across the air, so that, to whatever part they move, each with its several tendency, a short time only is spent in a long distance, I will proceed to explain, though rather, if pos­ sible, in agreeably-sounding verses than in many;
1 as the short melody of the swan is better than the croak of cranes swept­ afar among the ethereal clouds driven by the south-wind.
In the first place, we have constant means of observing how swift in their motion those bodies which are light, and which consist of minute particles, are.
Of which kind is the sun's light, and his heat;
for this reason, that they are com­ posed of minute primary-atoms, which are, as it were, struck out, and make no difficulty to pass through the interval of air, driven on by a succeeding stroke;
for the place of light passing on is instantly supplied by other light, and brightness is, as it were, propelled by successive brightness.
2
Wherefore images must, in like manner, be able to pass through an inex­ pressible space in a moment of time;
in the first place, because there is always some slight impulse3 at a distance behind them, which may carry them forward and urge them on;
and se­ condly, because they are sent forth formed with so subtle a texture, that they can easily penetrate any substances what­ soever, and, as it were, flow through the intervening-body of air.
Besides, if those atoms of bodies which are sent forth from within,4 and from the central portion of them, as the light and heat of the sun, are seen, gliding over the whole space of the air, to diffuse themselves abroad in a moment of time, and to fly through sea and land, and to flood the heaven which is above, where they are borne along with such rapid lightness, what shall we say of those particles, then, which lie ready on the outmost surface of bodies ?
Do you not conceive how much quicker and farther they ought to go, when they are once thrown off, and when nothing delays their progress ?
And do you not feel certain that they should fly over a much greater distance of space in the same time in which the light of the sun traverses the heaven ?
This also seems to be an eminently fitting example to show with how swift a motion the images of things are borne along, namely, that as soon as a bright-surface of water is placed in the open air, when the clear heaven is shining with stars, the radiant constellations of the sky immediately correspond in the water.
Do you now understand, then, in what a moment of time this image descends from the regions of the air to the regions of the earth ?
From which cause, however wonderful,1 you must necessarily admit, again and again, the existence of bodies which strike the eyes and excite our vision, and flow with a perpetual issue from certain substances;
as cold from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the waves of the sea, which is the consumer of walls round the shore;
nor do various voices cease to fly through the air ;
2 moreover the moisture, so to speak, of a salt taste, comes often into the mouth, when we are walking near the sea;
and, again, when we look at diluted wormwood being mixed, a bitterness af­ fects our palate.
So evidently a certain substance is borne rapidly away from all bodies, and is dispersed in all directions ground ;
nor is there any delay or interruption allowed to the efflux;
since we perpetually perceive it with our senses, and may see all objects at all times, and smell them, and hear them sound.
Further, since any figure felt with the hands in the dark is known to be the same which is seen by day and in clear light, it necessarily follows that touch and sight are excited by a like cause.
If, therefore, we handle a square object, and that object affects us as a square in the dark, what object, in the light, will be able to answer to the shape of it, except its quadrangular image ?
For which reason the faculty of dis­ cerning forms is found to depend upon images, and it seems that no object can be distinguished by the eye without them.
Now those images of objects, of which I am speaking, are carried in every direction, and are thrown off so as to be dis­ tributed on all sides;
but, because we can see only with our eyes, it therefore-happens, that whatsoever way we turn our sight, all objects on that quarter strike on it with their shape and colour.
And the image causes us to see, and gives-us­ means to distinguish, how far each object is distant from us.
For when it is sent forth from the object, it immediately strikes and drives forward that portion of air, which is situated be­ tween itself and our eyes;
and the whole of that air thus glides through our eyes,1 and, as it were, brushes the pupils gently, and so passes on.
Hence it comes to pass that we see how far distant each object is ;
and the more air is driven before the image, and the longer the stream of it that brushes through our eyes, the farther each object seems to be removed from us.
These effects, you may be sure, are produced with an ex- quisitely rapid process, so that we see what the object is, and, at the same time, how far it is distant.
In these matters it is by no means to be accounted wonderful, why, when those images which strike the eyes cannot be severally discerned, the objects themselves, from which they proceed, are perceived.
For, in like manner, when the wind strikes upon us by degrees, and when sharp cold spreads over us, we are not wont to perceive each first and successive par­ ticle of that wind and cold, but rather the whole together;
and we then perceive, as it were, blows inflicted upon our body, as if some substance were striking us, and producing in our frame a sense of its force which is without us.
Besides, when we strike a stone with our finger, we touch the very ex­ treme superficies of the stone, and the outside colour;
and yet.
we do not feel that colour with our touch, but rather perceive the hardness of the stone deeply seated within its substance.
And now learn in addition to this, why.
the image of an object in a mirror is seen beyond the mirror;
for certainly it seems extremely remote from us.
The case is the same as with those objects which are plainly seen out of doors, when a door, standing open, affords an unobstructed prospect through it, and allows many objects out of the house to be contem­ plated.
For this view, also, as well as that in the mirror, takes place, if I may so express it, with a double and twofold tide of air.
For first is perceived the air on this side of the door-posts;
then follow the door-posts themselves on the right hand and on the left;
next the external light strikes the eyes, and the second portion of air, and all those objects which are clearly seen abroad.
So, when the image from the glass has first thrown itself forward, and whilst it is coming to .our sight, it strikes and drives forward the air which is situate between itself and the eyes, and causes us to per­ ceive all this air before we see the mirror;
but when we have looked on the mirror itself,1 the image which is thrown off from us, reaches it, and, being reflected, returns to oui eyes, and so, propelling another portion of air before it, rolls it on, and causes us to perceive this air before we see itself;
and on that account seems to be distant, and to be so much removed from or behind the mirror.
For which reason, again and again I say, it is by no means right for those who study these matters, to wonder at the effects which attribute vision from the surface of mirrors to the influence of two portions of air;
since the appearance is produced by means of both.
Now that which is in reality the right side of our bodies, is made to appear on the left side in mirrors, for this reason, that when the image, which proceeds from our person, strikes upon the plane of the mirror, it is not reflected without a change, but, being turned back, it is so struck out of its former state, as would be the case with a mask of plaster, if, before it were dry, any one should dash its face against a pillar or a beam;
when, if it should preserve, at that instant, its true figure as in front, or as when its front was presented to you, and should exhibit itself, or its exact features, driven back through the hinder part of the head, it will happen that the eye which before was the right, is now become the left, and that which was on the left, correspondently, is made the right.
It is contrived, also, that an image may be transmitted from mirror to mirror;
so that five, and even six images, have been often produced.
For whatsoever object in a house shall be hid, as lying back in the interior part of it, it will yet be pos­ sible that every such object, however removed out of sight by crooked turnings and recesses, may, (being drawn out, by means of several glasses, through the winding passages,) be seen to be in the building.
So exactly is an image reflected from glass to glass ;
and, when it has been presented to us on­ the-left-hand, it happens afterwards that it is produced on-the­ right;
and thence it returns again, and changes to the same position as before.
Moreover, whatever small sides or plates there are of glasses, formed with a round flexure similar to that of our own side, they, on that account, reflect to us images in the right posi­ tion;
1 either because the image is transferred from glass to glass, and thence, being twice reflected, flies forward to us ;
or, again, because the image, when it comes forth, is turned about, inasmuch as the curved shape of the glass causes it to wheel itself round to us.
Further, you would suppose that our images in a mirror advance together with us, and place their foot with ours, and imitate our gesture;
which appearance happens from this cause, that from whatever part of the mirror you recede, the images, after that moment, cannot be reflected from that part, since nature obliges all images to be reflected from mirrors, (as well as to fly off from objects,) according to the corresponding ges­ tures of the person whom they represent.
2
Bright objects, also, the eyes avoid, and shrink from behold­ ing.
The sun even blinds you, if you persist to direct your eyes against it;
inasmuch as the power of it is great;
and images from it are borne down impetuously from on high through the clear air, and strike the eyes forcibly, disturbing and causing pain in their sockets.
1
Moreover, whatever splen­ dour is strong, often burns the eyes, because it contains many seeds of fire, which produce pain in the organs-of-sight by penetrating into them.
Besides, whatever objects jaundiced persons2 look upon, be­ come in their sight yellow like themselves;
because many atoms of yellow colour flow off from their bodies, meeting and tinging the images of objects;
and many of the same atoms are moreover mixed in their eyes, which, by their contagion, paint all things with lurid hues.
But when we are in the dark, we see, from the darkness, objects that are in the light, because when the black air of the darkness, being nearer to us, has entered the open eyes first, and taken possession of them, the bright white air immediately follows, which, as it were, clears them, and dispels the black shades of the other air;
for this lucid air is by many degrees more active, and far more subtle and powerful:
which, as soon as it has filled with light, and laid open, the passages of the eyes, which the dark air had previously stopped, plain images of objects immediately follow and strike upon the eyes, so that we see those objects which are situated in the light.
This, on the other hand, we cannot do, when we look from the light to­ wards objects in the dark, because the thicker air of darkness follows behind the light air;
which thicker air fills the pores, and stops up the passages of sight, so that the images of any things whatsoever, being involved in it, cannot be moved forward into the eyes.
3
And when we behold the square towers of a city a long way off, it happens, on account of the distance, that they often scem round, because every angle, being afar off, is seen as ob­ tuse, or rather is not seen at all;
the impulse of its image dies away, and the force of it does not reach to our eyes ;
since, while the images of it are borne through a large body of air, the air, by frequent percussions upon them, obliges that force to become-ineffective.
Hence it comes to pass, that when every angle has escaped our vision at the same time, the constructed stones are seen as if fashioned to a round;
1 not, however, like round objects which are immediately before us, and which are exactly circular, but they appear, as it were, nearly, after a shadowy fashion, resembling them.
Our shadow likewise seems to us to move in the sun, and to follow our footsteps, and to imitate our gesture;
(if you can fancy air, devoid of light, to go forwards, following the move­ ments and gesture of men ;
for that which we are accustomed to call shadow can be nothing else but air deprived of light;
) evi­ dently because the ground, in certain spots successively, is excluded from the radiance, wherever we, as we go, obstruct it;
and that part of it, which we have left, is again covered with light.
From this cause it happens, that what was the shadow of our body, seems to be still the same, and to have followed exactly-opposite us.
For fresh illuminations of rays are perpetually pouring themselves forth ;
and the first dis­ appear as quickly as wool vanishes, if applied to a flamed
By this means the ground is both easily deprived of light, and again covered with it, and discharges from itself the black shadows.
Nor yet in this case do we allow that the eyes are at all de­ ceived ;
for it is their business only to observe in whatever place there may be light or shade;
but whether the light is the same or not, and whether the same shadow, which was here, passes thither, or rather, as we said before, a new one is constantly produced,-this the judgment of the mind only must determine;
for the eyes cannot know the nature of things;
and therefore you must not impute to the eyes that which may be the fault of the understanding.
A ship, in which we sail, is carried forward, when it seems to stand still;
and that which remains stationary, is imagined to go by us;
and the hills and plains, past which we row our vessel, or fly with sails, seem to flee away astern.
All the stars seem to be at rest, as being fixed to the vaults of the sky;
and yet all are in perpetual motion;
for when, after rising, they have traversed the heaven with their shining orbs, they return to their distant places-of-setting.
And the sun and the moon, in like manner, seem to remain stationary;
bodies which observation itself shows to be carried forwards.
And mountains rising up, at a distance, from the middle of the sea, between which a free passage for ships is open, yet appear without separation, so that one vast island seems to be formed from the two united.
It likewise happens that to children, after ceasing to whirl themselves about, the rooms seem to turn, and the pillars to run round, so that they can hardly believe that the whole building is not threatening to fall upon them.
And when nature begins to raise on high the beams of the sun, red with tremulous fires, and to exalt them above the hills, the hills over which the sun then appears to be, himself apparently touching them close, (glowing with his own beams,) are scarcely distant from us two thousand flights of an arrow, often even scarcely five hundred casts of a dart;
yet between them and the sun, which seems in contact with them, lie broad expanses of sea, stretched out under vast regions of sky;
and many thousand miles of land also intervene, which various nations of men, and tribes of wild beasts, occupy and overrun.
And, to mention another ocular delusion, a puddle of water, not deeper than a finger, which settles among the stones in the paved streets, affords, apparently, a prospect downwards under the earth, to a depth as great1 as the height to which the lofty arch of heaven extends above the earth;
so that you seem to look down upon the clouds and to see a heaven be- tectA, and to behold, by a surprising effect, the celestial bodies buried in the sky under ground.
Moreover, when a spirited courser sticks fast with us in the middle of a river, and we look down into the swiftly-flowing water of the stream, a force seems to be carrying the body of the horse, though standing still, in a contrary direction to the current, and to drive it rapidly up the river;
and, whitherso­ ever we turn our eyes, all objects appear to us to be carried along, and to flow, in a similar manner.
A portico, too, although it be of equal dimensions through­ out, and standing supported with equal columns from-end-to­ end, yet, when it is viewed from the extremity through its whole length, contracts gradually, as it were, to the apex of a tapering cone, joining the roof to the floor, and all the right­ hand parts to the left, until it has narrowed-itself to the in­ distinct point of the cone.
To sailors at sea it occurs that the sun, having risen from the waves, seems also to set, and bury its light, in the waves;
as, in their situation, they behold nothing else but water and sky;
a remark which I make, that you may not lightly sup­ pose that the senses are altogether deceived.
But to those ignorant of the sea,2 ships in the harbour often appear to strive, disabled in their equipments, against the broken waves;
for though whatever part of the oars is raised above the water of the sea, is straight, and the part of the helm above the water is straight, the parts which go down, and are sunk in the water, seem all, as if broken, to be turned and in­ verted, sloping upwards, and, thus bent back, to float almost up to the surface of the water.
And when the winds, in the night time, carry light vapours athwart the sky, the bright constellations seem then to glide against the clouds, and to pass along on high in a far different direction than that in which they are really borne.
3
But if by chance the hand, applied to one eye, presses it underneath, it happens, by some impression on the sense, tha all things, at which we look, seem to become double as we gaze on them;
two lights in the lamps appear blossoming with flames;
the twin furnit ure seems to be doubled throughout the house;
and the faces of the people seem double, and their persons double.
Moreover, when sleep has bound our limbs in agreeable re­ pose, and the whole body lies in profound rest;
yet, at that very time, our limbs appear to be awake and to move them­ selves, and we imagine that, in the thick darkness of night, we see the sun, and the light of day;
and, though in a con­ fined place, we seem to change our position with respect to the heaven, the sea, rivers, and mountains, and to cross over plains on foot, and to hear sounds, though the unbroken silence of night reigns around us, and to utter words, though our tongues remain still.
Other things of this class, exciting our wonder, we see in great numbers;
all which seek, as it were, to destroy the credit of our senses:
but they strive in vain ;
since the greatest part of these appearances deceive us only because of the fancies which we allow to bear upon them;
so that those things which have not been seen by our senses, are to us as if seen.
For nothing is more difficult than to separate certain from doubtful things;
things which the mind, when their fallaciousness is discovered, straightway rejects from itself.
1
Moreover, if any one believes that nothing is known,2 he himself, also, knows not whether that can be known from which he, forming a judgment, confesses that he knows nothing.
Against him, therefore, I shall forbear to urge argument, who, of his own will, has placed himself with his face towards his footsteps.
3
And although I should even grant that he knows this, I should still put to him the following question:
when he has seen no truth in things previously, how he knows what it is to know and not to know, in contradistinction to one another ?
What cause, I shall ask him, produced his know­ ledge of truth and falsehood, and what power has proved to Aim that what is doubtful differs from what is certain ?
The knowledge of truth, you will find, is derived from the senses as-its-origin,1 and you will own that the senses cannot be refuted.
For that which, of its own power,2 can refute false notions by real facts, must be found of greater credit than to be liable to confutation.
What, then, must be esteemed of greater credit than the senses ?
Shall reasoning, arising from erring sense,3—reasoning, I say, which has arisen wholly from the senses, and which can depend on nothing else,—be of suffi­ cient force to refute those senses?
For unless these, our tenses, are true and trust-worthy, all reasoning consequently becomes false and unfounded ?
But what, that is external to the senses, shall confute the senses, or will they disagree among themselves, and refute one another?
Will the ears be able to refute the eyes ?
Or will the touch refute the ears ?
Or will the taste of the mouth, moreover, refute the touch ?
Will the nostrils confute the other senses, or will the eyes contradict them?
It is, as I think, not so;
for to each sense is separately assigned its own faculty;
each has its own power;
and it is therefore necessary that what is soft, and what is cold, and what is hot, should seem so;
and it is necessary, also, that we should perceive distinctly the various colours of things, and whatever things are connected with colours.
The taste of the mouth, likewise, has its own power separately;
scents are pro­ duced independently, and sounds independently of the other senses;
and it necessarily follows, therefore, that some senses cannot confute others.
Nor again, will they, as a body, con­ fute themselves;
for equal trust must at all times be placed in every one of them.
That, therefore, which, at any time whatsoever, has seemed true to them, is true.
And if reasoning shall be unable to unfold the cause why those objects which, when close at hand, were square, have appeared round at a distance, yet it is better for a man, being partially deficient in reasoning, to give explanations of each figure erroneously, than by any means to let slip1 from his bands things that are manifest, and to destroy the first prin­ ciples of belief, and tear up all the foundations on which life and safety rest.
For not only would all reasoning fall to the ground, but life itself would at once come-to-nothing, unless you venture to trust your senses, and to avoid precipices,2 and other things of this sort which are to be shunned, and to pur­ sue those things which are of a contrary character.
That, therefore, is all an empty body of words, you may be sure,3 which is arrayed and drawn up against the senses.
Lastly, as, in a building, if the rule is wrongly applied at first, if the square, being erroneously placed, deviates from the proper position, and if the level is in the least inexact in any spot, all parts-of-the-edifice are necessarily rendered faulty and distorted, and become ill-shaped, sloping, hanging forwards or backwards, and inconsistent with one another ;
so that some seem inclined to fall, and some actually do fall, being all made unsound by false measures at the commencement.
Thus, ac­ cordingly, whatever reasoning on things has sprung from fal.
lacious senses, must of necessity be erroneous and deceitful.
If the senses be false, all arguments from them must be false.
We have already spoken of sight;
and now no difficult argument is left for us, to show how the other senses discern each its own object.
In the first place, every sound and voice is heard, when, being infused into the ears, they have struck with their sub­ stance on the sense.
For we must admit that voice and sound are corporeal, since they can make impression on the senses.
On this account the voice often abrades the throat, and its loud sound, as it passes forth, makes the wind-pipe rougher.
For when the atoms of the voice (a larger body of them than usual having risen together) have proceeded to go forth from the mouth, the passage of the mouth, from the pores being filled up, is rendered hoarse, and the voice injures the road by which it issues into the air.
It is by no means to be doubted, therefore, that voices and words consist of corporeal particles, as having power to cause corporeal injury.
Nor does it escape your knowledge, also, how much sub­ stance perpetual speaking, protracted from the rising splen­ dour of Aurora to the shade of black night, detracts from the body, and how much it wears away from the very nerves and strength of men, especially if it is uttered with extreme loud­ ness.
The voice, therefore, must necessarily be corporeal, since he who speaks much, loses, from its effect, a portion of his corporeal-substance.
Nor do the particles of sound penetrate the ear under a like form, when the crooked barbarian trumpet bellows hea­ vily with a deep murmur, and calls up a hoarse dead-sound;
and when swans, in the pangs of death, raise, with a mourn­ ful voice, a liquid dirge from the vales of Helicon.
These words and sounds, therefore, (when, being formed within, we expel them from our body, and send then forth straight by the mouth,) the active tongue, skilful-in-forming words, articulates ;
and the shape into which the lips are put, partly assists to fashion them.
But asperity of the voice is caused by asperity of its particles, and its smoothness is also produced by their smoothness.
For this reason, when the distance is not great to the spot whence each word, having started forth, arrives at our ears, it happens, of necessity, that the words themselves are also plainly heard, and distinguished in-every-note;
for the voice keeps its formation, and maintains its figure.
But if a greater space than is convenient is interposed, the words, passing through a large body of air, are necessarily confused, and the voice, while it flies through the aerial-interval, is disordered.
It accordingly happens that you hear a sound, but cannot distinguish what is the meaning of the words;
1 so confused and obstructed does the voice come to you.
Besides, one word, uttered from the mouth of a crier in the midst of the people, often penetrates the ears of all.
One voice, therefore, suddenly divides into many voices, since it distributes itself to each individual ear, stamping on it, as it were, the form and clear sound of the words.
But that part of the several voices which does not fall on the ears them­ selves, is lost, being carried past them, and diffused through the air.
Some portion of it too, struck against solid objects, and rebounding like a stone,2 returns a sound, and sometimes mocks you with the semblance of a word.
Which things when you consider, my goodfriend, you may be able to render an account to yourself and others, how rocks, in solitary places, regularly return similar forms of words to those which we utter, when we seek our companions wandering among the shady hills, and call them, as they are scattered abroad, with a loud voice.
I have noticed places repeat six or seven words, when you uttered only one;
for the moun­ tains, reverberating the words spoken, repeated them so that they were re-echoed 3 without change.
Such places the neighbouring people pretend that Satyrs and Nymphs inhabit;
and say that there are Fauns in them, by whose noise, and sportive play, re-echoing through the night, they universally affirm that the dead silence is broken, and that sounds of chords and sweet plaintive-notes are heard, which the pipe, struck with the fingers of those playing, pours forth around.
They relate, also, that the race of husbandmen hear far and wide, when, frequently, Pan, shaking the piny garland of his half-savage head, runs over the open reeds with his curved lip, ceasing not to repeat1 his sylvan song.
Other wonders and prodigies of this kind they relate, lest, perhaps, they should be thought to dwell in lonely places, deserted even by the gods;
for this reason they talk of such marvels in their discourse, or, perchance, are prompted by some other cause, as all men are too eager for ears that will listen to wonderful stories.
2
Furthermore, it is not surprising, how, through places where the eyes cannot discern plain objects, through these very places voices pass, and excite the ears.
We often, too, wit­ ness a dialogue held between two persons in different apart­ ments, with the doors closed.
The cause is evidently this, that the voice can pass unbroken through winding pores of bodies, though images refuse to pass through them;
for the latter are broken to pieces, unless they go through straight passages, such as those of glass, through which every image flies.
Besides, the voice is distributed in all directions, inasmuch as some voices are produced from others;
for this happens where one voice has split itself into many, as a spark of fire, when it has started forth, is often wont to disperse itself into its own separate fires.
Places, accordingly, which have been all shut up behind and around the speaker, are filled with voices, and shaken with sound.
But as for images, they all, when once they have been thrown off, pass only by straight open­ ings, for which reason no one can see objects beyond walls, though he may hear voices from beyond them.
And yet this very voice, also, while it goes through the obstructed passages, is dulled, and we seem to hear a sound rather than distinct words.
That faculty, by which3 we perceive taste, the organs being the tongue and the palate, requires for itaelf somewhat more argument and more explanation.
In the first place, we perceive savour in the mouth, when we express it from food by mastication;
as when any one, for example, proceeds to press and dry with his hand a sponge full of water.
What we express, is then distributed through all the ducts of the palate, and the tortuous pores of the soft tongue.
1
By this means, when the atoms of the juice flowing out are smooth, they touch the sense agreeably, and affect all parts, around the humid exuding regions of the tongue, with plea­ sure.
But, on the other hand, as atoms are severally more endowed with roughness, so much the more, issuing forth in a body,2 they sting and lacerate the sense.
Moreover, pleasure experienced from the taste of food is limited by the extent of the palate;
as, when the juice has descended downwards through the throat, there is no enjoy­ ment while it is all being distributed through the members;
nor is it of any consequence with what food the body is nourished, so that you be but able to disperse what you take, when digested, through the organs, and preserve the humec­ tant3 tenor and action of the stomach.
I will now explain, (in order that we may understand this point,) how it is that different food is allotted to different ani­ mals, or why that which is sour and bitter to some, may yet seem to others extremely sweet.
And so great is the differ­ ence and variety in these matters, that that which to some is food, to others is rank poison.
Thus it happens that a ser­ pent, which is touched with human saliva,4 perishes, and even commits suicide by biting himself.
Besides, hellebore is strong poison to us, but increases the fat of goats and quails.
That you may understand by what means this happens, it becomes you in the first place to call to mind what we have often said before, that in bodies are contained many seminal- atoms, mingled in many ways.
Moreover, as all living crea­ tures, which take food, are dissimilar externally, and as the extreme outline of their limbs restricts them variously accord­ ing to their kinds, so they likewise consist of different seminal- particles, and vary in the figure of their elements.
Further, when the seminal-particles differ, their intervals and passages, which we call pores, in all the limbs, and in the mouth, and the palate itself, must likewise differ.
Some of these pores, therefore, must be greater, and some less;
some animals must have triangular pores, some square;
many pores must be round, and some polygonal, varied in several ways.
For as the na­ ture of the shapes of the semnal-particles, and their motions, require, the figures of the pores must differ accordingly, and the intervals among the atoms must vary just as the combina­ tion of the atoms demands.
On this account, when that which is sweet to some animals is bitter to others, exquisitely-smooth atoms must enter gently and easily into the pores of the palate of that animal to whom it is sweet;
but, on the contrary, rough and jagged particles, as is evident, pierce the mouths of those animals to whom the same substance is bitter.
From these facts it is now easy to understand every parti­ cular connected with this subject.
For when in any person fever has arisen from the superabundance of the bile, or any violence of disease has been excited by any other means, his whole body is at once disturbed, and all the positions of the atoms in him are changed;
it happens that particles which before suited his sense of taste, are now unsuitable to it, and others, which, when they have penetrated the pores, produce a bitte sensation, are more adapted to it.
For even in sweet bodies, as in the flavour and substance of honey, both rough and smooth particles are mixed;
a fact which we have de­ monstrated to you frequently before.
1And now give me your attention further;
for I shall show in what manner the approach of odour affects the nostrils.
First, there must necessarily exist many substances, from which a varied effluence of odours streams forth and evolves itself;
for that odours do both flow off, and are sent forth and dispersed abroad, we must naturally suppose.
But certain odours, on account of the different shapes of their particles, are more suited to some animals than to others:
and thus bees are attracted by the smell of honey in the air, however far distant, and vultures by the smell of carcasses;
also the keen- scent of dogs, preceding their steps, leads them1 whithersoever the cloven hoof of the stag has directed its course;
and the white goose, the preserver of the citadel of the Romans, per­ ceives from afar the smell of a man.
Thus different scent assigned to different animals, leads each to its own food, and causes it to recoil from destructive poison ;
and by this means the tribes of beasts are preserved.
Of this very odour, then, which excites the nostrils, it hap­ pens that one kind is carried farther than another;
but yet none of them is carried so far as sound, or as the voice;
—I forbear to say as those airy substances which strike the eyes, and excite vision.
For odour, wandering about, passes but slowly, and, being dispersed through the yielding air, soon gradually dies away;
2 chiefly because it is with difficulty evolved out of any substance from its interior.
For that odours flow and come forth from the interior of substances, this consideration sufficiently indicates, that all bodies when broken, bruised, or split into fragments in the fire, seem to cast a stronger scent than when whole.
It is, besides, easy to see that odour is composed of larger atoms than sound ;
since it does not penetrate through stone walls, through which the voice and sounds constantly pass.
For which reason you will see that it is not so easy to ascertain in what quarter a body that casts a scent is placed, as to find out one that emits a sound.
For the force and impulse of an odour, by moving slowly through the air, soon becomes chill and powerless;
nor do the atoms, the heralds of substances, come warm to the sense.
From this cause dogs are often at fault, and have to seek for traces of the scent.
Nor does this occur, indeed, in respect to odours only, and in the case of tastes;
but the appearances and colours of things, likewise, do not so agree with the senses of all men alike, but that some are more acrid and repulsive to the sight than others.
Even fierce lions cannot endure to stand against, and to look upon, a cock, which, as his flapping wings startle the night,1 is accustomed to call Aurora with his loud voice ;
lions, I say, will not endure him, so suddenly do they bethink them of flight;
the cause evidently being, that there are in the bodies of cocks certain particles, which, when sent forth into the eyes of lions, pierce the pupils, and cause sharp pain, so that the beasts, however fierce, cannot hold out against them, although these same particles cannot at all hurt our eyes;
either because they do not penetrate, or because, if they do penetrate, a free outlet from the eye is permitted to them, so that they cannot in any respect hurt the organs of sight by remaining in them.
And now give me your attention, and learn what substances affect the mind;
and understand, in a few words, whence those things which come into the mind proceed.
In the first place, I assert this, that numbers of subtle images of things wander about in many ways in all directions;
images which, when they meet, are easily united together in the air, as the spider's web, and a leaf of gold.
For these images are far finer in their texture than those which affect the eyes and excite vision;
since these penetrate through the small pores of the body, and excite the subtle substance of the mind within, and arouse the sense.
Thus it is that we see Centaurs, and the members of Scyllæ, and the Cerberean mouths of dogs, and the apparitions of those whose bones, after death has been passed, the earth con­ tains.
Since spectra of all kinds are every where carried about, which are partly such as are formed spontaneously in the air, partly, whatever fly off from various objects;
and partly, those which images, formed of figures of these two kinds, compose.
1
Foi assuredly the image of a Centaur is not formed from a living Centaur, since there has been no such figure in life;
but when the images of a horse and a man have come together by chance, they easily and quickly cohere, (as we said before,) because of their subtle nature and filmy texture.
Other images of this sort are produced in the same manner;
and since these, from their extreme lightness, are, as I have shown above, swiftly carried about, any one thin image of them all easily stimulates our mind with a single impression;
for the mind is itself subtle and eminently excitable.
That these things take place, as I state, you may easily learn from hence;
that inasmuch as this impression on the mind2 is similar to that on the bodily senses, it necessarily follows that that which we see with the mind, and that which we see with the eye, are effected by similar means.
As I have shown, accordingly, that I perceive lions, for example,3 by means of images of lions, which excite the eyes ;
we may un­ derstand that the mind is moved by images of lions in like manner, and by other images of other things,4 which it sees and discerns equally and not less than the eyes ;
only we must observe that it sees more subtle images.
Nor for any other reason does this sense of the mind be­ come awake when sleep has spread itself over the limbs, than because these same images excite our minds, which affect our senses when we are corporeally awake;
to such a degree that we seem plainly to behold him, of whom, his life having been yielded up, death and the earth have already taken pos­ session.
This Nature of necessity brings to pass;
and from this cause, that all the senses of the body, being obstructed and bound up by sleep, are at rest throughout the several mem­ bers, and are unable to refute any false appearance by real facts.
Besides, the memory lies inactive and torpid in sleep ;
and shows no disbelief in appearances, or intimates that he, whom the mind imagines that it sees alive, has long ago par­ taken of death and forgetfulness.
As to what remains for consideration, it is not surprising that images should move, and agitate their arms, and other members, with regularity;
for it happens that many an image seems to do this in our sleep.
This is to be explained in the fol­ lowing way;
that when the first image passes off, and a second is afterwards produced in another position, the former then seems to have changed its gesture.
This, doubtless, we must conceive to be done by a very rapid process;
so great is the -activity of images, and so great the number of things from which they proceed;
and so great too is the abundance of atoms, that it may suffice for that which is to be perceived by the senses, at any time whatsoever.
And many other ques­ tions are raised on these matters, and many points must be made clear by us, if we wish to explain these subjects dis­ tinctly.
In the first place, it is inquired why the mind immediately thinks of that very thing of which any one has desired to think.
1
Do images watch our pleasure, and, as soon as we wish, does an image present itself to us ?
If it is our desire to think of the sea, of the earth, or of the heaven, of assem­ blies of men, of a procession, of banquets, of battles, does nature create and prepare images of all these things at our word ?
Especially when the minds of different men in the same country and place, think of things entirely different ?
What shall we say, moreover, when we perceive images in our sleep advance before us in order, and move their pliant limbs;
when, as we observe them, they wave with ease their bending arms alternately, and repeat gesture after gesture with the foot corresponding to the look?
Are images, forsooth, inspired with the art of dancing, and do they, skilled in ges- ticulation, wander about, in order that they may make sport for us in the night time ?
Or will this rather be the truth, that we perceive that variety of motions in one and the same por­ tion of time;
as in that time in which one word is uttered,1 many smaller portions of time, (which reason discovers to be in it,) are contained?
From this cause it happens, that at any time whatsoever, any images are ready at hand, pre­ pared for all places;
so great is their activity, and so great the abundance of objects from which they proceed.
By this means, when the first image passes away, and a second is afterwards produced in another position, the first then seems to have changed its gesture.
And because images are subtle, the mind cannot acutely discern any but those which it earnestly endeavours to discern;
all, therefore, which exist besides these, pass away unnoticed, unless the mind has thus prepared itself and endeavoured to distinguish them.
The mind, accordingly, does prepare itself and expects that that will occur which is consequent2 on that which has preceded;
so that it observes each particular oc­ currence.
Thus, therefore, the effect is produced.
Do you not see, also, that the eyes, when they have begun to look at things which are small, exert and prepare them­ selves;
and that we could not, without this exertion, clearly di scern them ?
And even in respect, also, to objects easily dis­ tinguishable, you may observe, that if you do not apply your mind to remark any one of them, it is just the same as if it were all the time removed and far distant from you?
How is it therefore surprising, if the mind loses sight of all other images, except those concerning matters to which it is itself directed?
Besides, we form opinions of great things from small indications, and thus lead ourselves into the delusion of deceit.
It happens, also, that sometimes a second image is not pre­ sented of the same kind as the first, but that that which was before a woman under our hands, seems to be before us changed into a man;
or that one face, and one age follows after another;
but at this, sleep and oblivion prevent us from wondering.
In these matters, remember that it is necessary diligently to shun this fault,1 and to avoid it cautiously, as a most griev­ ous error;
the fault, namely, of supposing that all the parts of animals were formed with a view to the uses to which they have been adapted;
lest you should suppose that the bright luminaries of the eyes were produced that we may be able to see with them;
and that the pillars of the legs and thighs, built upon the feet, were united for this purpose, that we might take long steps on the road;
and, moreover, that the fore-arms fitted to the stout upper arms, and the hands ministering on either side, were given us that we might perform those offices which would be necessary for the support of life.
Other suppositions of this sort-whatever explanations men give-are all preposterous, reasoning being thus perverted.
For nothing was produced in the body to the end that we might use it;
but that which has been produced, being found serviceable for certain ends, begets use.
Neither was the fa­ culty of seeing in existence before the light of the eyes was made, nor that of speaking with words before the tongue was formed;
but rather the origin of the tongue long preceded speech, and the ears were made long before any sound was heard;
and, in fine, all members, as I think, existed before there was any use of them discovered.
They could not, there­ fore, have been produced for the sake of being used.
But, on the contrary, to engage in battle with the hand, and to tear the limbs, and to pollute the body with gore, was prac­ tised long before bright darts were hurled;
and nature com­ pelled us to avoid a wound, before the left hand, by the help of art, presented the defence of a shield.
And, certainly, to commit the wearied body to rest is of much more antiquity than the soft cushions of the couch;
and to quench the thirst was practised before cups were invented.
Such things as these, then, which were found out from expe­ rience and the objects of life, may be believed to have been in­ vented for the purpose of using them;
those things, however, which were all first produced independently, gave a knowledge of their utility afterwards.
Of which kind, especially, we see that the senses and members of the body are.
Wherefore again and again 1 say, it is impossible for you to believe1 that they could have been produced for the sake of use.
This, also, is not to be wondered at, that the very nature of the body of every animal requires food.
For I have shown that many atoms pass off and recede from substances in many ways;
but the most numerous must pass off from animals ;
because they are exercised by motion, and many particles are carried forth, urged from the interior of the body, by perspir­ ation ;
many, also, are exhaled through the mouth, when they pant from weariness.
By these means, therefore, the body wastes, and all its nature is undermined;
a state on which pain is attendant.
On this account food is taken, that it may support the limbs, and, being given at intervals, may recruit the strength, and repress the eager desire of eating through­ out the organs and veins.
Liquid also descends into all parts of the body, whatsoever require liquid;
and the moisture, coming into the frame, dis­ sipates the many collected atoms of heat, which cause a burn­ ing in our stomach, and extinguishes them like fire, so that arid heat may no longer dry up Cur limbs.
Thus, therefore, you see, panting thirst is expelled from our bodies;
thus the pining desire offfood is satisfied.
I will now state how it comes to pass that we can advance our steps when we please, and how it is given us to move our limbs out–of–the–direct–line;
1 and what cause is wont to push forward this great weight of our body.
Do thou, my friend, attentively-receive my instructions.
I affirm, then, that IMAGES OF GOING first approach to the mind, and impinge on the mind, as we observed before re­ specting images in general.
Thence arises will, for no man begins to do any thing, before his mind has discerned what it will do.
And according to what it discerns, is the image of his action.
2
When, therefore, the mind so stirs itself, that it desires to proceed and move forward, it immedi­ ately acts on the substance of the soul, which is distributed in the whole body, and through the limbs and joints;
and this is easily done, since the substance of the soul is held united with the mind.
That substance of the soul forthwith acts upon the body;
and thus, by degrees, the whole mass of the man is protruded and moved forwards.
The body at that time, moreover, opens its pores, and the air, which is always easily excited to motion, enters, as it na­ turally must indeed, through the open spaces, and penetrates the passages abundantly, and is thus dispersed through every minute portion of the body;
thus, therefore, the body, by two several powers,1 is made to move along as a ship with sails and wind.
Nor yet is it wonderful, in these matters, that atoms so small can wield so great a body, and turn about all our weight.
For the wind, though but light and of thin substance, drives forward a large ship with vast power;
and one hand rules the vessel, with whatever speed it may be going;
while one helm turns it in any direction.
And a machine, by the help of wheels and pulleys, lifts many bodies of great weight, and raises them on high with but a slight force.
And now I shall explain by what means sleep spreads rest through our limbs, and dispels the cares of the mind from our breast;
but I shall do this rather in agreeably-sounding than in numerous verses, as the short melody of the swan2 is better than the croak of cranes, dispersed among the clouds of hea­ ven, driven by the south wind.
Do you only, 0 Memmius, devote to me your attentive ears and discerning mind, that you may not deny what I say to be possible, and depart from me with a breast repelling true precepts, when you yourself are in fault, and yet cannot perceive that such is the case.
In the first place, sleep occurs when the substance of the soul has been disturbed throughout the several members, and has partly seceded from the body, (as being driven forth abroad,) and has partly, as being more concentrated, retreated into the interior of the body;
for then, at length, when the frame is in this state, the limbs are relaxed and lose their power.
Since there is no doubt but that this our vital sense exists in us by means of the soul, which sense when sleep hinders from be­ ing exerted, we must then suppose that our soul is disturbed, and expelled from the body;
but not wholly, for if it were all withdrawn, the body would lie steeped in the eternal cold of death, as, in that case, no part of the soul would remain latent in the members, (concealed as fire lies hidden under thick ashes,) whence the sense might be suddenly rekindled through­ out the limbs, and flame, as it were, rise from secret heat.
But by what means this change from wakefulness to sleep is produced, and how the soul may be disturbed, and the body languish, I will explain.
Do you, my friend, take care that I may not pour out my words to the winds.
In the first place, it necessarily happens that the body since it is touched by the breezes of the air to which it is ex­ posed, must be externally assailed and harassed by the frequent impulse of that air;
and, for this reason, almost all animated bodies are covered with hide, or even with shells, or with hard skin, or bark.
This same air, likewise, impinges on the in­ terior part of the body of animals, when, as they breathe, it is drawn in and respired.
For which reason, when the body is affected from both causes,1 and when assaults penetrate through the small pores of our frame to its primary parts and first elements, a labefactation, as it were, takes place by de­ grees throughout our members;
for the positions of the ele­ ments of the body and mind are disturbed, so that part of the soul is drawn forth from them, and part retires hidden into the interior;
part also, dispersed throughout the limbs, cannot remain united together, nor perform its ordinary motions mu­ tually with other parts;
for nature obstructs the communica­ tions and passages, and therefore, the motions of the atoms being changed, sense wholly fails.
2
And since there remains nothing that can, as it were, prop up the limbs, the body becomes weak, and all its members languish;
the arms and the eye-lids fall, and the hams often subside with a sinking lassitude,3 and relax their strength.
Sleep, too, follows upon taking food, because food, while it is being distributed through all the veins, produces the same effects which the air produces ;
and that sleep is far the most heavy which you take when full or weary;
because most of the atoms of the frame are then disturbed, being shaken with much effort.
By the same means, a deeper concussion in the substance of the soul takes place, as well as a larger ejection of it without, and it becomes more divided in itself and dis­ tracted within.
And in general, as 3ach of us, having pursued any study, is devoted to it in his thoughts, or in whatever occupation we have been much engaged previously,-and the mind has been more exerted in that pursuit,—we seem, for the most part, to go through the same employments in sleep.
Lawyers seem to plead causes and to make laws;
generals to fight and en­ gage in battles;
sailors to wage settled war with the winds:
and myself to pursue this work, and investigate perpetually the nature of things, and to explain it, when discovered, in the language of my country.
Thus other studies and arts seem generally, in sleep, to occupy the minds of men with delusions.
And whatsoever per­ sons have given continual attention to games and spectacles for many days in succession, we generally see that, in those persons, when they have ceased to observe those objects with their bodily senses, there are yet passages remaining open in the mind, where the same images of the same objects may enter.
For very many days, therefore, those same images are presented before their eyes, so that they seem, even when awake, to see figures dancing, and moving their pliant limbs, and to listen with their ears to the liquid music and speaking chords of the lyre;
and, likewise, to perceive the same assem­ bly, and to contemplate, at the same time, the various decora­ tions of the scene shining before them.
Of so great influence is study and inclination, and so much difference does it make in what pursuits, not only men, but indeed all animals, have been accustomed to be engaged.
For you will see stout horses, when their limbs shall be stretched in sleep, yet perpetually perspiring and panting, and apparently exerting their utmost strength for the palm of victory, or often starting in their sleep as if the barriers were just set open.
And the dogs of huntsmen, when stretched in gentle repose, often throw out their legs on a sudden, and hurriedly utter cries, and frequently draw in the air with their nostrils, as if they were pursuing the newly-discovered traces of wild-beasts;
and oftentimes, after they are awakened, they follow in ima­ gination the empty images of stags, as if they saw them turned to flight, until, their delusions being dispelled, they return to their senses.
And the fawning breed of dogs that are accus­ tomed to the house, begin at times to rouse themselves and start up from the ground, just as if they saw strange faces and looks.
And the more fierce any breeds are, the more must the same breeds show fierceness in their sleep.
But various birds, likewise, take flight, and suddenly disturb with their wings the groves of the gods during the night, if, in their quiet sleep, hawks have appeared, pursuing and flying after them, to offer battle and threaten hostilities.
Moreover the minds of men, whatever great things they effect with vast efforts in the day, frequently perform and carry on the same things also during their sleep.
Kings storm cities,1 we taken prisoners, join battle, raise a cry as if they were being stabbed on the spot.
Many struggle-desper­ ately, and utter groans as if in pain, and fill all parts around with loud shrieks, as if they were torn by the bite of a panther or savage lion.
Many in sleep speak of important matters;
and men have very often made in dreams a revelation of their own guilt.
Many, apparently, die;
many show terror through their whole frame, like persons who are casting them­ selves to the ground from high mountains, and, as if deprived of their senses, (so disturbed are they by the agitation of their body,) scarcely, after sleep, recover themselves.
A thirsty man, also, in his dream, often sits near a river or pleasant fountain, and almost swallows up the whole stream with his mouth.
Boys, too, bound fast in sleep, fancy that, being near a tank or broken vessel, they are raising up their garment, and pour forth the bottled liquid 2 of the whole body, when the Babylonian coverlets, of magnificent splendour, are saturated.
Or when, at length,3 the full ripe hour is reach'd
Of vigorous manhood, and the genial stores Crowd through the members, ceaseless then, at night, Forms of the fair, of look and hue divine, Rush on the spirit, and the ducts of love So stimulate, where throngs the new-born tide, That, as the tender toil were all achieved, Full flows the stream, and drowns the snowy vest.
For, as we erst have sung, the seeds of life First spring when manhood first the frame confirms.
And as on various functions various powers
Alone can act propulsive, human seeds
By nought but human beauty can be rous'd.
These, when once gender'd from their cells minute
O'er every limb, o'er every organ spread, Crowd in full concourse towards the nervous fount
By nature rear'd appropriate;
whence abrupt Excite they oft, as forms of beauty rise, The scenes at hand, the regions ruled by love.
Then springs the tender tumour, the warm wish Full o'er the foe, the luscious wound who deals, With dexterous aim to pour the high-wrought charge, And full contending in the genial fight.
So falls the victim on the part assailed:
With the red blood the glistening bruise so swells;
And o'er th' assassin flows the tide he draws.
So he who feels the shaft of love propell'd
From the dear form that charms him, towards the spot Aims, whence the wound proceeds;
supreme he pants
To join the congest, and from frame to frame
Pour the rich humour;
for the fierce desire, Now felt, assures how vast the bliss to come.
This, this is Venus:
this he deems true love;
Hence flow the drops delicious that the heart Erode hereafter, and its train of cares.
For, though the form adored be absent, still Her phantoms haunt the lover, and his ear Rings with her name, whatever the path pursued.
Yet fly such phantoms, from the food of love Abstain, libidinous;
to worthier themes Turn, turn thy spirit;
let the race at large
Thy liberal heart divide, nor lavish, gross, O'er one fond object thy exhausted strength, Gend'ring long cares, and certain grief at last.
For love's deep ulcer fed, grows deeper still, Rank, and more pois'nous;
and each coming day Augments the madness, if the wretch, perchance, Heal not old wounds by those of newer date, From fair to fair wide-wand'ring, or his mind Turn from such subjects to pursuits unlike.
Nor are the joys of love from those shut out Who brutal lust avoid;
the pure of heart Far surer pleasures, and of nobler kind, Reap, than the wretch of lewd and low desires, Who, in the moment of enjoyment's self, Still fluctuates with a thousand fears subdued ;
O'er the fair wanton, dubious, long who hangs, What charm his eyes, his hands shall first devour:
Till fixt, at length, with furious force the spot Painful he presses, through his luscious lips Drives his keen teeth, and every kiss indents ;
Striving in vain for joys unmix'd, and urg'd
By latent stimulus the part to wound, Where'er its seat, that frenzies thus his soul.
But Venus softly smooths the wrongs endur'd, And mutual pleasures check the lover's rage.
Then hopes he, too, in the same form to quench
The maddening fires where first the flame arose.
Vain hope, by every fact disproved;
for this,
The more the soul possesses, still the more Craves she with keenest ardour.
Foods and drinks
As through the frame they pass, by toil worn out, Fill many a huge interstice;
obvious whence Dies the dread sense of hunger and of thirst;
But human beauty, and the rosy cheek, With nought the panting lover can endow But fruitless hopes, but images unsound, Scattered by every wind.
As, oft, the man, Parch'd up with thirst, amid his dreams to drink Strives,1 but in vain, since nought around him flows
But void, unreal semblances of floods;
So with her votaries sports the power of love, False phantoms sole presenting, nor can sight, Where'er it rove, be sated with the gaze, Nor can the lover's lawless fingers tear Aught from his idol, o'er her as he hangs, And the full power of every charm explores.
E'en when, in youth's prime flower, his panting frame Enclasps her frame that pants, when all his soul Expects the coming bliss, and Venus waits
To sow the fertile field, though then amain In amorous fold he press her, lip to lip Join, and drink deep the dulcet breath she heaves, 'Tis useless all;
for still his utmost rage Can nought subtract;
nor through the fair one force
His total frame, commingled with herself.
Yet oft thus strives he, or thus seems to strive;
So strong the toils that bind him;
so complete Melt all his members in the sea of love.
And though, when now the full-collected shock Pours from the nerves, some transient pause ensue, Yet short its period ;
the fond fever soon,
The frenzy quick returns, and the mad wretch Still pants to press that which he pressed before;
Nor aught of antidote exists, so deep Pines he, perplext, beneath the latent ill.
Then, too, his form consumes, the toils of love Waste all his vigour, and his days roll on In vilest bondage.
Amply though endowed,
His wealth decays, his debts with speed augment, The post of duty never fills he more, And all his sick'ning reputation dies.
Meanwhile rich unguents from his mistress laugh, Laugh from her feet soft Sicyon's shoes superb;
1
The green-ray'd emerald o'er her, dropt in gold, Gleams large and numerous;
and the sea-blue silk, Deep-worn, enclasps her, with the moisture drunk Of love illicit.
What his sires amassed Now flaunts in ribands, in tiaras flames Full o'er her front, and now to robes converts Of Chian loose, or Alidonian mould;
2 While feasts and festivals of boundless pomp, And costliest viands, garlands, odours, wines, And scattered roses ceaseless are rcnew'd.
But fruitless every art;
some bitter still Wells forth perpetual from his fount of bliss, And poisons every flow'ret.
Keen remorse Goads him, perchance, for dissipated time, And months on months destroyed ;
or from the fair Haply some phrase of doubtful import darts, That, like a living coal, his heart corrodes;
Or oft her eyes wide wander, as he deems, And seek some happier rival, while the smile
Of smothered love half-dimples o'er her cheeks.
Such are the ills that on amours attend Most blest and prosperous;
but on those adverse Throng myriads daily, obvious and more keen.
Hence, by the muse forewarned, with studious heed Shun thou the toils that wait;
for easier far Those toils to shun, than, when thy foot once slides, To break th' entangling meshes and be free.
Yet though insnar'd, and in the silly net Led captive, thou may'st still, if firm of mind, And by these numbers sway'd, thy foot release.
First the defects, then, of the form ador'd, Of mind, of body, let thy memory ne'er One hour forget;
for these full oft mankind See not, by passion blinded;
while, revers'd, Charms they bestow which never were the fair's.
Hence frequent view we those, each grace denied, The coarse, the crooked, held in high esteem.
And lovers laugh o'er lovers, and exhort Offerings to Venus since so vilely sway'd, While yet themselves are sway'd more vilely still.
To such the black assume a lovely brown;
The rank and filthy, negligence and ease;
The red-eyed is a Pallas;
the firm-limb'd, All bone, a bounding roe;
the pigmy dwarf, A sprightly grace, all energy and wit;
The huge and bulky, dignified and grand$
The stammerer lisps;
the silent is sedate;
The pert virago, spirit all and fire;
The hectic, fine and delicate of frame;
The victim worn with pulmonary cough, On life's last verge, a maid of matchless waist;
The broad, big-bosom'd, Ceres full displayed, As from the bed of Bacchus ;
the flat-nos'd
Of monkey shape, a Satyr from the woods;
And the broad-lipp'd, a Nymph for kisses form'd.
But countless such conceits, and to narrate Idle;
yet grant the frame ador'd possessed
Of face divine, that all the power of love Plays o'er each limb symphonious, others still Exist of equal beauty;
still ourselves Once liv'd without her;
and full well we know She, too, each art essays the baser need, And so with scents bedaubs her that her maids Far fly oppressed, and vent their smothered laugh.
Then, too, the wretched lover oft abroad Bars she, who at her gate loud weeping stands, Kissing the walls that clasp her;
with perfumes Bathing the splendid portals, and around Scattering rich wreaths and odoriferous flowers.
Yet when at length admitted, the first breath
So deep offends him, he some motive seeks Instant to quit her ;
his long-labour'd speech
Of suffering drops, and owns himself a fool, That for one moment he could deem her crown'd With charms the race of mortals ne'er can boast.
This know full well the Paphian nymphs, and, deep Behind the scenes of action, each defect Strive they to hide from him they fain would sway.
But vain th' attempt;
for oft the mind will guess
The latent blemish, and the laugh unfold.
Whence those of soul ingenuous frankly own, Frequent, those faults which none can all escape.
Yet not for ever do the softer sex Feign joys they feel not, as with close embrace, Breast join'd to breast, their paramours they clasp, And print their humid kisses on their lips.
Oft from their hearts engage they, urg'd amain
By mutual hopes to run the race of love.
Thus nature prompts;
by mutual hopes alone, By bliss assur'd, birds, beasts, and grazing herds, The task essay;
nor would the female else E'er bear the burden of the vigorous male, By mutual joys propell'd.
Hast thou not seen,
Hence tempted, how in mutual bonds they strive Work'd oft to madness ?
how the race canine Stain with their vagrant loves the public streets, Diversely dragging, and the chain obscene Tugging to loose, while yet each effort fails ?
Toils they would ne'er essay if unassur'd
Of mutual bliss, and cheated to the yoke.
Whence o'er and o'er the bliss must mutual prove.
If when the male his genial energy Imparts, the female deep her breath retract Transported most, the race produced will, then, From female store prove female ;
if reversed, From store paternal, male.
But when the form Blends both its parents' features, it ascends From equal powers of each;
the impulse warm Rousing alike, through each conflicting frame, The seeds of latent life in scale so nice
That neither conquers, nor to conquest yields.
Oft view we, too, the living lines portrayed Of ancestors remote;
for various seeds, Commingled various, through the parent frame Lurk, which from race to race preserve entire
The form, the features of the anterior stock.
Diversely such the power creative blends;
Whence oft the voice revives, the hair, the hue, The full complexion of the race deceased;
For these as sure from seeds defin'd ascend
As e'en the face, the body, or the limbs.
Then, too, though male the fetus, female stores
Aid the production;
while, if female formed, The tide paternal mixes in the make;
For both must join, or nought can e'er ensue.
But obvious this, that when the semblance more Inclines to either, the prevailing sex Chief lent the seeds of life, and rear'd complete
The virgin embryo, or incipient man.
Nor ever interfere the gods above
In scenes like these, the genial soil lock up, Or curse with barren love the man unblest, No lovely race who Ioasts to hail him sire,- As deem the many, who, in sadness drown'd, Oft offer victims, and, with fragrant gums, Kindle the blazing altar, wearying heav'n Vainly, tc fill the void reluctant womb.
For blank 3teri lity from seeds ascends
Too gross, or too attenuate;
if the last, Ne'er to the regions that generic spread Cleave they, rejected instant as propell'd.
But if too gross the genial atoms, dull Move they, and spiritless, or never urg'd With force sufficient, or of power devoid
The puny ducts to pierce, or, pierced, to blend Harmonious with the vital fluid found.
For Jove harmonious, whence increase alone Can pring, oft differs largely;
easier far Some filling some, and others easier fill'd
And gravid made by others;
whence, at times, Those, many a Hymen who have erst essay'd Vainly, at length th' appropriate stores acquire, And feel the lovely load their wombs enrich.
While he, perchance, whose prior banns forbade
All the fond hope of offspring, happier now A mate has found of more concordant powers, And boasts a race to prop his crumbling age.
So much imports it that the seeds of life
With seeds should mix symphonious, that the gross Condense the rare, the rare the gross dilute, And man with woman duly paired unite.
Much, too, concerns it what the foods employed;
For some augment the genial stores, and some Dissolve their crasis, and all power destroy.
Nor small the moment in what mode is dealt
The bland delight.
The sage who views minute Herds, and the savage tribes by nature led, Holds that the virtuous matron chief conceives, When, with subsiding chest, and loins erect, Her dulcet charms she offers, fittest then The luscious tide t' absorb;
for nought avail Exerted motions, the perpetual heave Of frame high-strain'd.
and ever-labouring lungs
These, rather, urg'd beneath the tender fray, All fruit prohibit;
since the genial share
Oft turn they from the furrow as it holds Its course direct, and break th' impinging shock.
And hence the wanton mistress acts like these Frequent indulges, to preclude increase, And more transport the lawless form she clasps:
Arts the chaste matron never needs essay.
Nor from the darts of Ven us, nor the smile
Of gods above, is she of homelier make Frequent beloved ;
the praise is all her own.
By her own deeds, by cleanliness most chaste, And sweet consenting manners, the delight Lives she of him who blends his lot with hers.
Such virtues must prevail, and day o'er day Perfect their power;
for, though of gentlest kind, Yet urg'd perpetual, such the sternest heart Must gradual soften, and at length subdue.

Or who has such power over words, that he can compose eulogies proportionate to the merits of him, who has left to us such blessings obtained and acquired by his own intellect ?
No one, as I think, formed of a mortal body, will ever be able.
For if we ought to speak as the known dignity of the subjects which he expounded requires, he was a god, a god, I say, 0 illustrious Memmius, who first discovered that discipline of life1 which is now called WISDOM;
and who, by the science of philosophy, placed human existence, from amid so great waves of trouble, and so great darkness of the mind, in so tranquil a condition and so clear a light.
For compare with his investigations the ancient discoveries of others which are called divine;
as Ceres is said to have pointed out corn to mortals, and Bacchus the liquid of wine produced from the grape;
though life, nevertheless, might have continued without these gifts, as it is reported that some nations even now live without them;
but men could not have lived well and happily without a pure and undisturbed breast.
For which reason he, from whom the sweet consolations of existence, now spread abroad through mighty nations, calm the minds of men, seems to us the more justly to be accounted a god.
But if you shall imagine that the deeds of Hercules excel his, you will be carried far away from sound reasoning.
For what harm would those vast jaws of the Nemaean lion, and the bristly Arcadian boar, do to us at present ?
Or what injury could the bull of Crete, and the Hydra, the pest of Lerna, de­ fended with poisoned snakes, inflict on us at this time?
Or how could the triple-breasted strength of the three-fold Geryon hurt, us ?
And how could the horses of Diomede, breathing fire from their nostrils, dwelling near Thrace, and the Bisto­ nian regions, and Ismarus;
or how could the Arcadian birds, formidable with their hooked talons, inhabiting the lake Stym­ phalus, have so much annoyed us that we should think much of their destruction ?
Or how, I pray, would the fierce ser­ pent, with his stern looks and huge body, that watched, as he encircled the stem of a tree, the shining golden apples of the Hesperides, have interfered with our comfort, when he lived­ near the shore of the ocean, and the rough waters of the sea, whither neither any countryman of ours goes, nor any barba­ rian dares to approach?
How, I ask, would other monsters of this kind, which have been killed, hurt us, if they had not been conquered, and were now alive ?
Not at all, as I am of opinion;
for thus, even now, the earth is abundantly overrun1 with wild beasts, and filled with alarming terror throughout the groves, and vast mountains, and deep woods;
but these are places which we for the most part have power to avoid.
But unless the mind is purified, what contests and dangers must we incur in spite of our utmost efforts!
How many bitter cares, arising from lust, tear the man distracted by them, and how many consequent terrors!
Or what ills do pride, uncleanness, wantonness, produce!
How great calamities do they cause!
And what evils do luxury and sloth generate!
Will it not be fit, then, that we should deem this man, who subdued all these evils, and expelled them from the mind, not with arms, but with words, worthy to be ranked in the num­ ber of the gods ?
Especially when he was accustomed to give precepts, both numerous and divinely expressed, concerning the immortal gods themselves, and to set forth in his instruc­ tions the whole nature of things.
This is he on whose track I have entered, whilst I pursue his system of philosophy, and show, in these expositions, how necessarily all things individually continue-their-existence ac­ cording to that law by which they were produced, and how impotent they are to break the strong conditions of time and destiny.
2
In which class of things produced and limited in ex- istence, the substance of the mind, above all, has been found to be;
and has been demonstrated to be formed of a generated consistence at first, and to be unable to endure uninjured through vast eternity.
But I have also made it plain, that when we seem to behold him, in our sleep, whom life has left, mere images are accustomed to deceive the mind.
For what remains, the course of my subject has now brought me to the point at which I have to demonstrate that the world1 consists of dissoluble matter, and that it had also a beginning;
and to show by what means the combination of matter established the earth, the heaven, the sea, the stars, the sun, and the globe of the moon ;
and what living creatures sprung from the earth, and what, though believed to have ex­ isted, have at no period been produced.
2
I have also to tell how the human race, with various speech, began to hold in­ tercommunication3 by means of names of things;
and by what process that oppressive fear of the gods entered the breasts of men;
a fear which maintains throughout the world sacred temples, lakes, groves, altars, and images of the divinities.
I shall besides explain by what force ruling nature guides the courses of the sun and the paths of the moon, lest, perchance, we should think that these bodies pursue eternal revolutions unrestrained and of themselves, in order to promote the growth of fruits and living creatures;
and lest we should sup- pose that they are guided by any plan of the gods.
For if those who have fairly understood that the gods pass a life free from care, nevertheless wonder, meanwhile, how things can severally be carried on, especially in those matters which are seen in the ethereal regions over our heads, they are carried back again to their old notions of religion, and set over them­ selves cruel tyrants, whom they unhappily believe able to do all things ;
being themselves ignorant what can, and what can­ not, be done, and by what means limited power, and a deeply fixed boundary, are assigned to every thing.
To proceed, then, and to delay you no longer with pro­ mises, contemplate, in the first place, the sea, and the earth, and the heaven ;
the triple nature of which, dear Memmius, (three bodies, three forms so dissimilar, three substances of such a different consistence,) one day will consign to destruc­ tion ;
and the mass and fabric of the world, sustained through so many years, shall sink into total dissolution.
1
Nor does it escape my consideration, how new and wonder­ ful a subject it is for your reflection, that there will be an end to the heaven and the earth ;
and how difficult it is for me to convince you of this with arguments;
as it generally happens, indeed, when you offer to the ear a subject hitherto strange to it, and yet cannot submit it to the sight of the eye, or put it into the hand;
the avenues through which the nearest main road2 of belief leads into the human breast and the regions of the mind.
But yet I will express my thoughts;
fact itself, perhaps, will bring credit to my words, and you will see, per- chance, all things violently shaken, in a brief space of time, with rising convulsions of the earth;
which time may Fortune, with commanding power, avert far from us;
and may reason, rather than reality, convince us that all things, overcome by the influence of time, may sink with a direfully-sounding trash into destruction.
On this subject, before I begin to utter oracles, (expressed with more sincerity, and with much more true reason, than those of the Pythian priestess, who speaks from the tripod and laurel of Apollo,) I will set forth to you many consolations in learned and philosophic arguments, lest, perchance, being re­ strained by religion, you should suppose that the earth, the sun, the heaven, the stars, and the moon, being endowed with a divine nature, must pursue their courses eternally;
and lest you should conceive, in consequence, that it is just for all those, (after the manner of the giants,) to suffer punishment for their monstrous wickedness, who, by their reasoning, would shake the walls of the world, and seek to quench the radiant sun in the heavens;
animadverting, in mortal speech, on bodies which are called immortal, but which, in reality, are so far distant from divine power, and are so unworthy to appear in the number of gods, that they may rather be thought adapted to give us a notion of that which is altogether re­ moved from vital motion and sense.
For it is not possible that the nature and rationality of in­ tellect should be thought capable of existing in all kinds of bodies whatsoever.
As a tree cannot exist in the sky,1 nor clouds in the salt sea;
nor can fish live in the fields, nor blood be in wood, nor liquid in stones;
so it is fixed and appointed where every thing may grow and subsist.
Thus the nature of the mind cannot spring up alone without the body, or exist apart from the nerves and the blood.
Whereas if this could happen, the faculty of the human soul might rather arise in the head, or shoulders, or in the bottom of the heels, and might rather indeed be accustomed to grow in any place, than to remain in the same man and the same receptacle of the man.
But since it seems certain and fixed even in our own body, in what part the soul and the mind may subsist and grow up by themselves, it is so much the rather to be denied that they can exist out of the entire body, and without an animal form, whether in the soft clods of earth, or in the fire of the sun, or in the water, or in the lofty regions of the air.
The heaven­ ly bodies, therefore, since they cannot be animated with life, are not endowed with a divine sense.
It is not possible, moreover, that you should believe there are sacred seats of the gods in any quarters of our world.
For the nature and substance of the gods, being subtle and far removed from our senses, is scarcely apprehended by the power of our mind.
And since it has hitherto escaped the touch and impact of our hands, it can assuredly touch nothing that is tangible by us ;
for nothing can touch another body, if it is not possible for itself to be touched.
For which reason the abodes of the gods, also, must be dissimilar to our abodes, as being subtle, and correspondent to their own nature.
1
These points I shall hereafter prove to you with abundance of argument.
To say, moreover, that the gods designed to arrange all this noble fabric of the world for the sake of men, and therefore that we ought to extol it as an honourable achievement of the deities, and to believe that it will certainly be eternal and imperishable;
and to affirm that it is unlawful ever to disturb from its seat, by any force of argument, that which was established for the human race by ancient contrivance and for perpetual duration, or to shake and displace, though only in words, the sum of things from their basis ;
2 and to feign and add other conceits of this sort, dear Memmius, is to be guilty of the utmost folly;
for what profit can our gratitude afford to those who are immortal and blessed in themselves, that they should labour to effect any thing for our sake ?
Or what new incitement could induce those, who were before tranquil, to desire, so long afterwards, to change their former mode of life?
3
For it would seem that he only, whom old things offend, ought to delight in things that are new;
but in him to whom no trouble has happened in past time, when he spent life happily, what could excite the desire of novelty ?
1
Or, forsooth, the life of the gods was oppressed with gloom and sorrow, until the genial birth of terrestrial things shone forth ?
Or, again, what evil would it have been to us never to have been born ?
For whoever is born must certainly wish to re­ main in life, as long as any alluring pleasure shall engage him;
but to him who never tasted the love of life, nor was ever in the number of living beings?
what affliction is it not to have been born ?
Moreover, whence was a model or idea for making things, and whence was the notion of men themselves, implanted in the gods at first, that they should know, and conceive in their mind, what they should seek to do ?
Or by what means was the power of primary-particles known, and what they could effect by their change of order and place, if Nature herself did not give the first specimens of production ?
For the primordial atoms of things were driven in so many ways by so many impulses, through an infinite duration of time, and were accustomed so to be borne and carried forward by their own weight, and to meet in all modes, and to try all endeavours, as if to ascertain what their combinations might generate, that it is not surprising if they fell at last into such positions, and acquired such motions, as those by which this universe of things, through perpetual renovation is now car­ ried on.
But if I were even ignorant what the primary-elements of things are, yet this I could venture to assert, from the scheme of the heaven itself, and to support it from many other rea­ sons, that the system of things was by no means prepared for us by divine power, so great is the faultmess with which it stands affected.
In the first place, of all that space which the rapid circum­ volution of the heaven covers, mountains and woods, the abodes of wild beasts, have occupied a vast portion ;
1 rocks, and great marshes, and the sea, which widely separates the coasts of countries, cover another vast portion.
Moreover, burning heat, and the constant descent of frost, deprive mor­ tals of almost two-thirds of what is left.
And as to the land which yet remains, nature would still, by her own operation, cover it with thorns, if human strength did not prevent;
which, for the sake of a living, is accustomed to groan under the stout mattock, and to cut the earth with ploughs urged through it.
For unless we, turning up the fertile clods with the plough­ share, and forcing the soil, excite it to send forth its pro­ ductions, they would be unable of themselves to rise into the liquid air.
And yet at times, when all things, procured with so great labour, are green and flourish over the earth, either the sun in the heavens burns them up with violent heat, or sudden showers and cold frosts destroy them, or blasts of winds, with violent hurricanes, tear them to pieces.
Besides, why does nature cherish and increase, by land and by sea, a terrible brood of wild beasts and monsters, hostile to the human race ?
Why do the seasons of the year bring dis­ eases ?
Why does untimely death wander abroad ?
Moreover, an infant, as soon as nature, with great efforts, has sent it forth from the womb of its mother into the regions of light, lies, like a sailor cast out from the waves, in want of every kind of vital support;
and fills the parts around with mournful wailings, as is natural for one by whom so much evil in life remains to be undergone.
But the various sorts of cattle, herds, and wild beasts, grow up with ease;
they have no need of rattles or other toys;
nor is the fond and broken voice of the nurse1 necessary to be used to one of them.
Nor do they require different dresses according to the season of the year;
nor, besides, have they any need of arms, or high walls, with which they may defend their property, since the earth herself, and Nature, the artificer of things, produce all supplies for all in abundance.
Above all, since the body of the earth, and the water, and the light breezes of the winds, and the warm heat, of which this Sum of Things seems to be constituted, consist wholly of generated and dissoluble substance, the whole frame of the world must be considered to be of a similar nature.
2
For of whatever creatures, in mortal shapes, we see the parts and members to be of a generated consistence, we observe, in general, these same creatures to be themselves both generated and mortal.
For which-reason, when I see the four elements, the vast members and divisions of the world, wasted and re­ produced, I may conclude that there was also a time when the heaven and earth had a beginning, and that there will be a time for their destruction.
On these points, do not imagine, my Memmius, that I have assumed any thing too hastily, in supposing earth and fire to be perishable;
in not doubting that water and air waste away;
and in saying that the same elements are again pro­ duced and augmented.
In the first place, some part of the earth, parched with the constant heat of the sun, and tram­ pled with the perpetual action of feet, exhales mists and fly­ ing clouds of dust, which strong winds disperse through the whole air;
part also of the clods is washed off by showers,3 while rivers, as they strike against their banks, wear them away.
Besides, whatever body increases another, is, on its own part, diminished;
and since the earth, which is the parent of all things, seems, without doubt, to be the common sepulchre of all things;
the earth, therefore, you may be as­ sured, is wasted, and is recruited and grows again.
Further, there is no need of words to show that the sea, rivers, and fountains abound with new liquid, and that waters flow incessantly into the ocean;
for the vast deflux of streams from all sides declares it;
but we must observe, above all things, that a certain portion of the water is carried off, and that it happens at last that there is no superabundance1 of water;
for first that part is removed which the strong winds, sweeping the ocean, and the ethereal sun, dispelling it with his rays, subtract from its surface;
and next that part which is distributed through all the earth underneath.
For the salt is strained off in its passage through the ground, and the sub­ stance of the water flows back, and all meets, here and there, at the sources of rivers;
whence it flows, in a fresh stream, over the earth, wherever a passage, once cut, has borne along the waters in their liquid course.
2
I shall now, therefore, observe concerning the air, that it is changed,3 every hour, in innumerable ways.
For whatever is perpetually passing off from bodies, is all carried into the vast ocean of air;
and unless it were to restore particles back to those bodies, and to recruit them as their substance passes away, all things would by this time have been dissolved and converted into air.
It accordingly does not cease to be per- petually generated from bodies, and perpetually to return back to bodies;
since it is agreed that all things are in con­ stant flux.
The ethereal sun, too, the great fountain of liquid light, floods the heaven perpetually with new brightness, and in­ stantly supplies with a new ray the place of the ray that has passed off.
For whatever brightness it first sends forth, is, wherever it falls, lost to it.
This you may collect from hence, that as soon as clouds have begun to come over the sun, and, as it were, to break through the rays of light, all the lower part of these rays is immediately lost, and the earth, wherever the clouds pass, is overshadowed;
so that you may understand that things constantly require a fresh supply of light, and that every first emission of radiance is dispersed;
nor could objects otherwise be seen in the sunshine, unless the fountain of light itself furnished a perpetual supply.
Even your nocturnal torches, which are things of earth, your hanging lamps, and tapers, brilliant with waving flames, and showing themselves fat with abundance of smoke, are im­ pelled,1 in a similar manner, by the agency of heat, to emit new radiance;
they incessantly discharge their tremulous rays;
2 they never cease;
nor does the light, as if broken off, leave the place dark.
So swiftly is the destruction of that flame hastened from all its rays, through the rapid origination and emission of new particles.
Thus, too, we must suppose that the sun, and moon, and stars throw off their light through successive generations of beams,3 and perpetually lose what­ ever rays are first to pass from them;
so that you must not by any means suppose that these bodies maintain imperishable vigour.
Do you not see, moreover, that even stones are overcome by time ?
Do you not observe that lofty towers fall, and that rocks decay ?
Do you not notice that the temples and images of the gods, overcome with age, open in fissures;
and that the sacred deities themselves cannot extend the limits of fate, or struggle against the laws of nature ?
Besides, do we not see that the monuments of heroes fail ?
You might even believe that they desire for themselves a time to grow old.
1
Do we not observe that flints crumble from the lofty mountains, and cannot endure and withstand the powerful force of even a finite age ?
For if they were bodies which, through infinite ages, had sustained all the assaults of time, and continued exempt from dissolution, they would not now sud­ denly be broken away and fall to pieces.
Further, contemplate this heaven around and above us, which contains all the earth in its embrace;
it produces, as some say, all things from itself, and receives all things, when dissolved, into itself.
But it was a generated body, and con­ sists wholly of perishable substance.
For whatever increases and nourishes other things from itself, must by that means be diminished, and must be recruited by receiving2 into itself fresh substances.
In addition, if there was no origin of the heavens and earth from generation, and if they existed from all eternity, how is it that other poets, before the time of the Theban war, and the destruction of Troy, have not also sung of other exploits of the inhabitants of earth ?
How have the actions of so many men thus from time to time fallen into oblivion?
How is it that they no where survive in remembrance, and are no where stamped on everlasting monuments of fame ?
But, as I am of opinion, the whole of the world is of com­ paratively modern date, and recent in its origin;
and had its beginning but a short time ago.
From which cause, also, some arts are but now being refined, and are even at present on the increase;
many improvements are in this age added to ships;
musicians have but recently produced melodious sounds.
This nature and system of the world, too, of which I write, has been but lately discovered ;
and I myself, among the first discover­ ers, have been found the first poet that could express it in the language of my country.
But if, perchance, you suppose that all these arts2 formerly existed the same as at present, but that generations of men have perished by burning fire, or that cities have fallen by some great catastrophe of the world, or that violent rivers, through continual rains, have inundated the earth, and overwhelmed cities, you must so much the more, being convinced by these facts?
admit that there will probably be also a destruction of the earth and the heaven.
For, since things were affected and shaken by so great disorders, and so great dangers, if a more serious cause had then pressed upon them, they might univers­ ally have suffered destruction and mighty ruin.
Nor do we, who now live, appear to be mortal one like another, by any other inference than that we sicken with diseases similarly4 to those whom nature has removed from life.
Further, whatsoever bodies remain eternal,5 must either, as being of a solid consistence, repel assaults, and suffer nothing to penetrate them that can disunite their compact parts within ;
(such as are the primary-particles of matter, the na­ ture of which we have already shown;
) or they must be able to endure throughout all time, because they are exempt from assaults, or unsusceptible of them;
(as is a vacuum, which re­ mains intangible, and suffers nothing from impact;
) or they must be indestructible for this reason, that there is no suffici­ ency of space round about, into which substances may, as it were, separate and be dissolved (as the entire universe is eternal, inasmuch as there is neither any space without it, into which its parts may disperse;
nor are there any bodies which may fall upon it, and break it to pieces by violent con­ cussion).
But, as I have demonstrated, neither is the nature of this world of a solid consistence, since in all compound bodies vacuity is mixed ;
nor is it like vacuity itself;
nor, again, are bodies wanting, which, rising fortuitously from the infinite of space, may overthrow the sum of things with a violent tempest, or bring upon it some other kind, whatever it may be, of disaster and danger;
nor, moreover, is vastness and profundity of space wanting, into which the walls of the world may be scattered, or, assaulted by some other kind of force, may be dissolved.
The gate of death, therefore, is not closed to the heaven, or to the sun, or to the earth, or to the deep waters of the sea, but stands open, and looks back for them, with a mighty and huge abyss.
For which reason, since these existing things are dissoluble, you must necessarily allow that they are generated of indisso­ luble elements;
for bodies which are of mortal consistence, could not have been able, from all eternity, to contemn till now the strong assaults of infinite time.
Furthermore, since the great divisions of the world1 are per­ petually contending, and are stirred up in implacable warfare against each other, do you not see that some end to their long contest may be assigned ?
And this end may take place, either when the sun, and heat in general, having drunk up all the moisture, shall have become supreme;
a consummation, in­ deed, which they endeavour to effect, but cannot yet accom­ pUsh their designs;
so much do rivers supply, and so con­ stantly do the waters threaten, even of their own power, to deluge all things from the deep gulf of the ocean ;
(but their threats are vain ;
for winds, sweeping the floods, and the ethe­ real sun, dispelling them with his rays, diminish their bulk, and seem to trust that they can dry up all things before the waters can attain the completion of their design;
) maintain­ ing so great a war, they persist to strive with one another for their great objects, and to contend, as it seems, with equal efforts;
though, as is reported, fire was once superior on the earth, and water once reigned triumphant over the plains.
For fire prevailed, and burnt and consumed many parts, when the erring and impetuous fury of the sun's horses hur­ ried Phaethon through the whole heaven and over the entire earth.
But the omnipotent Father, incensed with fierce rage, hurled Phaethon from his chariot to the earth by the sudden stroke of a thunderbolt;
and the Sun, meeting him as he fell, caught up the eternal lamp of the world, brought back his scattered horses, and yoked them trembling to the car;
and, guiding them in their own path, restored and re-organ­ ized all things.
This, you must be aware, is the story which the poets of the Greeks sung, but which is too far removed from truth and reason.
For fire may have the superiority, when more atoms than usual of igneous matter have collected from the infinite of space;
but afterwards its strength, being by some means repressed, necessarily subsides;
else all things, burned up by a scorching atmosphere, would utterly perish.
Once, too, as tradition tells, water having-risen-in-a-body,1 began to have the mastery;
at which period it overwhelmed numbers of mankind with its waves;
but subsequently, when its strength, (which had risen from the infinite profound,) was in some way turned aside and repelled, the rains came to a stand, and the rivers diminished their violence.
But I shall now proceed to relate, in due course, how the combination of matter2 established the heaven and the earth, the depths of the sea, and the revolutions of the sun and moonFor assuredly neither the primary elements of things dis.
posed themselves severally in their own order by wisdom or counsel arising from a sagacious understanding;
nor, certainly, did they agree among themselves what motions each should produce;
but because the primordial atoms of the world, being many, were agitated by concussions, in many ways, through an infinite space of time, and were accustomed to be carried forward by their own weights, and to combine in all modes, and to try all efforts, as if to ascertain whichsoever of them, meeting together, might give birth to some offspring, it from this cause happens that, being spread abroad during a vast period of duration, and attempting all kinds of combinations and movements, those at length came together, which, having suddenly coalesced, became at first, and become now, from time to time, the commencements of great productions,1 the origin of the earth, the sea, and the heaven, and of every kind of living creatures.
Here, at that time, could be seen neither the chariot of the sun, flying on high with its abundant light, nor the stars of the great firmament, nor the sea, nor the heaven, nor the earth, nor the air;
nor could any thing be discerned similar to our present objects, but only a certain crude agitation of matter, and a congeries swelling up together.
Afterwards the parts began to separate ;
and similar things began to be united with similar, and to evolve the world, and display its parts, and arrange its different members, which were generated from all kinds of primordial atoms;
whose intervals, courses, (-,-on­ nexions, weights, impulses, combinations, and motions, Dis­ cord, exciting war amongst them, (from the disagreement of their forms and the variety of their shapes,) had disturbed;
on which account they could not remain all so united, or pro­ duce such suitable motions among themselves, as should lead to the objects which they were to effect;
that is, to divide the high heaven from the earth, and to cause that the sea and other water should spread abroad separately, and that the stars of heaven should shine by themselves pure and distinct.
For, in the first place, the several atoms of earth, because they were heavy, and involved one with another, met all to­ gether in the middle, and took, as it were, the lowest place;
1 which atoms, the more closely they cohered, the more effectu­ ally they excluded from themselves those particles which were to form the sea, the stars, the sun and the moon, and the walls of this great world.
For all these latter parts of nature con­ sist of more smooth and round particles, and of atoms much more diminutive, than the earth;
and, accordingly, the fiery ether, bursting forth from the several parts, through the small pores of the earth, first raised itself on high, and, being light, carried with it much fire;
by a process similar to what we often witness, when, in the morning, the golden rays of the beaming sun first blush over the grass gemmed with dew, and when the stagnant lakes, and ever-flowing rivers, exhale a mist, and earth itself sometimes appears to smoke;
all which vapours, when they are united in the height above us, cover the heaven in an apparently condensed body.
So, too, at that time, the light and expanded ether, diffused around in a united mass, collected itself;
and thus, being widely extended in every direction, enclosed all other things in its vast embrace.
2To this formation of the ether succeeded the rise of the sun and moon, and of those bodies whose orbs revolve in the air between both;
bodies which neither the earth nor the vast ether attracted to itself, because they were neither so heavy as to sink down to the earth, nor so light as to glide in the highest regions;
and yet they so exist between both, that they revolve as active bodies,3 and are a part of the entire world.
As, in our own bodies, some members may remain at rest.
whilst others are still in motion.
These substances, therefore, being withdrawn, the earth, where the vast blue region of the sea now spreads, suddenly sunk down, and hollowed out depths by means of the salt flood;
and in proportion as, day after day, the surrounding tide of air, and the warm rays of the sun, urged the earth (lying exposed even to its extreme bounds) with frequent im­ pulses, so that, being thus acted upon, it might collect in con­ densation towards its own centre, so much the more the salt fluid, pressed out from its body, increased with its flood the sea and the liquid plains;
and so much more the numerous particles of heat and air, escaping forth from other substances, flew upwards, and formed, afar from the earth, the lofty and shining temples of the sky.
The plains sunk down, and the slopes of the high mountains increased;
for such inequality was inevitable;
as the rocks could neither subside, nor could all parts of the ground settle to the same level.
Thus, then, the heavy-mass of the earth, with condensed bulk, stood firm;
and all the heavy grossness of the world, as it were, collected to the bottom, and sunk down like dregs into the deep.
Then the sea, the air, and the fiery ether itself, which were of liquid consistence, were all left pure;
and of these bodies some were lighter than others, and the ether, being of the greatest subtlety and levity, floats above the breezes of the air, nor allows its clear substance to mingle with the matters that disturb the aerial regions;
it leaves all these lower parts to be swept with violent whirlwinds;
it leaves them to be disturbed with tumultuous storms;
whilst itself, gliding with settled impulse, bears along its own fires.
For that the ether may revolve thus steadily, and with uniform tenor, the flood in the Euxine shows,1 which moves with a settled flux, pre­ serving one unvaried direction in its course.
Let us now state what is the cause of the motion of the stars.
In the first place, if the great orb of heaven whirls round, we must admit that air presses and urges the sky on either side, and confines it externally, and encloses it in each direction ;
then that another body of air flows over our heads, and tends in the same direction in which the bright stars of the eternal world roll;
1 and that there is still other air beneath our feet,2 which carries along the heaven in the opposite direc­ tion, as we see running streams turn wheels and buckets.
It is likewise possible that the whole heaven may remain stationary, though the bright constellations are nevertheless borne along;
whether because active tides of ether are con­ fined within the sky, and, seeking an outlet, whirl themselves round, and roll with them the stars through the vast regions of heaven ;
or whether air, flowing from some quarter with­ out, wheels and impels the stars;
or whether they of them­ selves can move forward, whither the sustenance of each attracts3 and invites them, while pursuing their course, and re­ cruiting their igneous substances every where throughout the heavens.
For which of these causes prevails in this world, it is difficult to lay down as certain ;
but I demonstrate only what is possible, and may be effected, throughout the universe, in various worlds, formed in various ways,4 and seek to assign several causes for the motions of the stars;
which causes may.
operate, in different parts, through the whole of things;
but of which one must necessarily be this very cause, that produces motion in our stars;
though to decide which of them it is, is, by no means the part of a man proceeding, like myself, cau­ tiously, and step by step.
And that the earth may rest in the middle1 part of the world, it is necessary that its weight should gradually, as it were, become evanescent and imperceptible,2 and that it should have another substance beneath it, united with it from its earliest age, and closely connected with the aerial parts of the world, in which it was produced and continues to live.
The earth is, therefore, no burden to the air, nor at all depresses it;
just as his limbs are no burden to a man ;
and just as the head is no burden to the neck;
nor do we feel the whole weight of the body press upon the feet.
But whatever weights fall upon us, and are laid upon us, externally, hurt or annoy us, although they are often far less than those which are within us;
of so great importance it is to understand what one thing can effect by union with another.
The earth, accordingly, was not brought into this world suddenly, as a foreign body, and cast, from some other quarter, upon air that was strange to it, but was produced together with the rest of the world, and as a regular part of it, at its first origin;
just as our members are seen to be formed with us.
Besides, the earth, when shaken with violent thunder, imme­ diately shakes all things which are above it with its motion ;
an effect which it could by no means produce, unless it were combined with the aerial parts of the world, and with the heaven ;
for they cohere by common connexions one with the other, conjoined, and coalescing in union, from the earliest period.
Do you not observe, also, how exquisitely subtle a sub­ stance of the soul sustains the body, which is of great weight, simply because it is so closely united and combined with it ?
What power, too, but that of the soul, which governs the limbs, can raise the body with a vigorous leap from the ground ?
Do you now understand how much force a subtle sub­ stance may have, when it is united with a heavy body, as the air is joined with the earth, and the power of the soul with ourselves ?
Nor can the circumference of the sun be much greater, or its fire less,' than it appears to our senses.
For from what­ ever distances fires can throw their rays, and cast a warm heat upon our bodies, the ejection of the heat from those dis­ tances detracts nothing from the bulk of the igneous matter, and the fire is not at all more contracted to the view.
Since, therefore, the heat of the sun, and its effused light, reach to our senses, and the parts about us shine with its rays, the form and outline of the sun must, on this account, appear as it really is, so that you can add nothing more to it, or make it less.
And the moon, whether, as she glides through the sky, she illu­ minates its regions with a borrowed light, or whether she sends forth radiance from her own body ;
whichsoever is the case, she is, as sAe pursues her course, of no larger a dimension 2 than she appears to our eyes as we observe her.
For all objects which, being far remote from us, we view through a large body of air, look confused in their appearance, before their out­ line seems at all diminished.
For which reason the moon, since it presents a clear shape and defined outline, (as it does whenever its outmost edges1 are observed,) must hence appear to us in the sky just as large as it is.
2
Further, whatsoever stars in the heavens you view from hence, can, assuredly, be only very little less, or only very little larger,3 than they appear;
since of whatsoever fires we see on the earth, even whilst the motion of their light is plain, and their glow is clearly perceived, the outline seems at times to vary in one way or other, contracting or expanding, according as it is more or less distant.
It is not, moreover, a matter of wonder, how so small a body as the sun can emit so large a quantity of light, as to cover with its flood the seas, the whole earth, and the heavens, and to pervade all things with its quickening heat.
Since it is possible that one fountain of the light of the whole world, opened from hence, may flow forth abundantly, and scatter its radiance abroad;
4 because the atoms of heat, we may suppose, so meet together here from all parts of the world, and their assemblage forms such a flood, that all this heat may flow from one source.
For do you not observe, too, how small a spring of water sometimes irrigates the meadows far and wide, and flows exuberantly over the fields ?
It is also possible that heat may pervade the air with a strong glow from no very great fire in the sun, if, perchance, the air be so tempered and disposed as to be excited to warmth, though affected with but gentle fervour;
as we sometimes see fire, from one spark, spread in all directions among corn-fields and straw.
And, perhaps, the sun, shining on high with its rosy light, contains about it much heat in secret stores-of-fire, which, though it be distinguished by no brightness, yet, retaining a glow, increases the force of the rays to such a degree as we experience.
Nor does the law of the sun's motion appear plain and evi.
dent, nor is it demonstrable how he passes from his summer regions to.
the wintry part of his course in Capricorn, and how, coming back from thence, he turns to the solstitial points;
nor do toe understand how the moon seems to traverse that space in each month, in passing through which the sun occupies the period of a year;
a plain reason, I say, has not been assigned for these phenomena.
For, in the first place, that appears possible which the ven­ erable opinion of the philosopher Democritus asserts;
that the nearer each of the heavenly bodies is to the earth, the less swiftly can they be carried round by the revolution of the heaven;
since the rapid and strong force of the upper sky decreases and loses its power beneath;
and that, accord­ ingly, the sun, with the lower constellations following it,1 is gradually left behind, because it is much beneath the fiery signs ;
2 also that the moon, from this same cause, falls back so much the more, for the more distant its course, being lower, is from the heaven, and approaches to the earth, the less can it exert its swiftness with the signs.
Since the more gentle is the speed with which the moon, being lower than the sun, is borne along, the more easily all the signs around overtake it, and are carried past it.
Hence it happens, that the moon seems to return more quickly to each sign, because the signs return towards it.
It is possible, also, that two currents of air, at a certain season, may blow in turns3 from opposite quarters of the world;
of which currents one may be that which drives the sun from the summer signs into the winter part of his course, and into freezing cold;
and the other may be that which sends him back from the freezing shades of cold into the warm regions and glowing constellations.
And, in like manner, we may suppose that the moon, and the stars, which revolve for long years in vast orbits, may move by means of two currents of air in opposite directions.
Do you not notice, also, that clouds, by means of opposite winds, go in different ways, the lower contrary to the upper ?
And why, therefore, may not these heavenly bodies be borne through the vast circuits of the sky by currents opposed to each other ?
But the reason why night1 covers the earth with its great darkness, is either because the light grows weak when the sun, after his long course, has reached the extremity of the heaven, and has sent forth his fires languidly, as being exhausted with the journey,2 and wasted by passing through a long tract of air;
or because the same force, which carried the solar orb above the earth, compels it to turn its course beneath the earth.
Matuta, also, the goddess of the morning, leads forth the rosy Aurora, and spreads abroad the light, at a certain hour, either because the same sun, which was under the earth, returning again, aspires to the heaven, proceeding to enlighten it with his rays;
or because, at that particular time, bodies of fire congregate, and many atoms of heat are accustomed to meet in confluence, which cause a new light of the sun to be per­ petually produced.
Thus it is said, that from the lofty hills of Ida3 the rays of the sun, when his light rises in the east, are seen dispersed, and that they afterwards collect, as it were, into one body, and form a complete orb.
Nor ought it, in such phenomena, to be a subject of won­ der, that these atoms of fire can thus flow together, and re­ new the splendour of the sun, at a certain time.
For we observe many other things which take place at a certain time in all departments
Of nature;
the groves flourish at a certain time, and at a certain time drop their verdure.
At a certain time, also, age directs the teeth to be shed;
and causes the immature youth to bloom with soft down, and to let the flexible beard, too, descend from his cheeks.
Lightnings, moreover, snow, rain, cloudy weather, and winds, take place at seasons of the year by no means uncertain.
For since the first com­ mencement of causes thus arose, and the affairs of the world thus proceeded, as at present, from their earliest origin, every event is a consequence in the unvarying course of things.
That the days also increase while the nights grow shorter, and that the days are diminished in length when the nights become augmented, may possibly happen, either because the same sun, revolving below and above the earth, divides the regions of the air with unequal curves, and distinguishes the orb of heaven into dissimilar parts, while, whatever it has taken from one part of it, it adds, as it revolves, just so much to the opposite part, until it has come to that sign in the heavens where the node of the year1 makes the darkness of night equal to the light of day:
(for the heaven has two sepa­ rate points, at equal distances, where the courses of the north wind and the south meet ;
2 owing to the position of the whole circle of the zodiac, in which the revolving sun consumes the pe­ riod of the year, illumining the earth and the sky with oblique light,-as the system of those declares who have observed that whole region of the heaven which is distinguished by the array of the twelve signs:
) or, because the air is denser in certain parts, the tremulous rays of light are therefore retarded, and cannot easily penetrate it and emerge to the dawn ;
for which reason the nights in the winter delay long, until the bright herald of day 3 returns:
or, again, because, at alternate seasons of the year, the atoms of flame, which cause the sun to rise4 in a particular part of the heavens at a particular time, are ac­ customed to congregate slower or faster.
As for the moon, sAe may shine because she is struck with the rays of the sun, and may turn towards us every day a larger portion of light in her aspect, as she recedes farther from the sun's orb, until, being opposite to him, she has shone forth with fullest splendour, and, rising on high in the east, has beheld his setting in the west;
thence, also, retiring back­ wards, she may, as it were, hide her light gradually, as she approaches from the opposite side, along the circle of the zodiac, nearer to the sun's radiance;
as those philosophers suppose, who make the moon to be in shape like a ball, and to pursue her path of revolution beneath the sun;
land hence it happens that they seem to say what is true.]
1There is also a hypothesis by which the moon may revolve and present various phases of brightness, with her own light.
For it is possible that there may be another body, which moves and advances2 together with her, and which in every way ob­ structs and hinders her light, but nevertheless cannot be seen, as it passes along in total darkness.
And the moon may possibly revolve upon her axis, like a ball3 tinged with shining light only on one side, and may, by turning her orb, present to us her various phases.
Thus, pro­ gressively, she turns that part which is illuminated, so as to behold us with full aspect and open eye ;
4 then, by degrees, she turns away and removes from us the brilliant side of her orb ;
5 as, indeed, the Babylonish doctrine of the Chaldæans taught, which, refuting the method of the Greek astrologers, labours to support this hypothesis in opposition to it;
just as if that, for which each contends, might not be true, or as if there were any reason why you should choose to embrace one opinion less than the other.
Further, when you see so many things produced in a cer­ tain order, it is difficult to demonstrate by reason, and to evince by argument, why a new moon may not be generated every day, with a certain succession of phases and figures, and each moon, as it diurnally arises, diurnally decay, and another be reproduced in its place and station.
For the Spring and Venus begin their course, and the wing­ ed zephyr, the harbinger of spring, walks before, near whose footsteps maternal Flora, preparing the way, covers the whole path with richest flowers and perfumes;
next follows scorch­ ing Summer, and dusty Ceres closely attendant on her, and the Etesian breezes of the northern winds then succeeds Autumn, together with whom advances Bacchus;
then follow other weather and other winds, the loud-resounding south-east and the south fraught with thunder;
at length cold brings on snows, and spreads abroad benumbing chillness, and Winter comes after, and frost chattering with his teeth.
Since, there­ fore, so many things may occur at a certain time, it is the less surprising if the moon is at a certain time produced, and at a certain time decays.
As for the eclipses of the sun, and occupations of the moon,2 you must suppose that they may arise from various causes.
For, (as you perhaps ask,) why should the moon only be thought able to shut out the world from light, and to oppose her high head to it on the side of the earthy (obtending her dark orb to the sun's glowing rays, and not some other body, 1 which may always revolve devoid of light, be considered able to produce such an effect at the same time ?
And why, also, may not the sun, at a certain time, send forth his radiance languidly, and again renew his splendour, when, in his passage through the air, he has passed by certain places which, we may suppose, are hurtful to his beams, and which cause his fires to be suppressed and extinguished ?
And why should the earth have power,2 in its turn, to de­ prive the moon of light, and, passing itself above, to keep the sun shut out from her, (while she passes monthly through the dense coniform shadow,) and why should not some other body be able, at that time, to pass beneath the moon, or to glide over the orb of the sun, which body may intercept from her his effulgent rays and spreading light?
And still, if the moon shines herself by her own brightness, why may she not grow dim in a certain part of the world, while she passes through regions noxious to her light ?
For what remains, since I have shown how every thing may occur in the blue sky of our vast world, in order that we might understand what power and causes might produce the varied course of the sun and the wanderings of the moon, and by what means they are accustomed to have their light ob­ structed and eclipsed,3 and to spread sudden darkness over the earth, (when they shut their eyes, as it were, for a time, and then, having opened them again, cover every fair region with shining light,) I now return to the early age of the world, and the tender fields of earth, to consider what kind of productions they first ventured,1 with their new power of generation, to raise into the regions of light, and to commit to uncertain winds.
In the beginning, then, the earth spread over the hills the growth of herbs, and the beauty of verdure, and the flowery fields, throughout all regions, shone with a green hue;
and then was given, to the various kinds of trees, full power of shooting upwards through the air.
2
For as feathers, and hairs, and bristles, are first produced over the limbs of quadrupeds and the bodies of the winged tribes, so the new earth then first put forth herbs and trees;
and afterwards generated the numerous races of animals,8 which arose in various forms and by various modes.
For animals, that were to live on the earth, could assuredly neither have fallen from the sky,4 nor have come forth from the salt depths of the sea.
It remains, there­ fore, to believe that the earth must justly have obtained the name of MOTHER, since from the earth all living creatures were born.
And even now many animals spring forth from the earth, which are generated by means of moisture and the quickening heat of the sun.
It is accordingly less wonderful, if, at that time, creatures more numerous and of larger size arose, and came to maturity while the earth and the air were yet fresh and vigorous.
First of all, the race of winged animals, and variegated birds, left their eggs, being excluded in the season of spring;
as grasshoppers, in these days, spontaneously leave their thin coats 5 in the summer, proceeding to seek sustenance and life.
Next, be assured, the earth produced, for the first time, the tribes of men and beasts;
for much heat and moisture abound- ed through the plains, and hence, where any suitable region offered itself, a hind of wombs sprung up.1 adhering to the earth by fibres.
These, when the age of the infants within them, at the season of maturity, had opened, (escaping from their moist-enclosure, and seeking for air,) nature, in those places, prepared the pores of the earth, and forced it to pour from its open veins a liquid like milk ;
just as every woman at present, when she has brought forth, is stored with sweet milk, because all the strength of the food is directed to the breasts.
Thus the earth afforded nourishment to the infants ;
the warmth rendered a garment unnecessary;
and the grass supplied a couch abounding with luxuriant and tender down.
But the early age of the world gave forth neither severe cold nor extraordinary heat, nor winds of impetuous violence.
For all these alike increase and acquire strength by time.
For which cause, I say again and again, the earth has justly acquired, and justly retains, the name of MOTHER, since she herself brought forth the race of men, and produced, at this certain time, almost every kind of animal which exults over the vast mountains, and the birds of the air, at the same period, with all their varied forms.
But because she must necessarily have some termination to bearing, she ceased, like a woman, exhausted by length of time.
For lapse of time changes the nature of the whole world, and one condition after another must succeed to all things, nor does any being con­ tinue always like itself.
All is unsettled;
nature alters and impels every thing to change.
For one thing decays, and, grown weak through age, languishes ;
another, again, grows up, and bursts forth from contempt.
2
Thus age changes the nature of the whole world, and one condition after another falls upon the earth;
so that what she could once bear she can bear no longer ;
while she can bear what she did not bear of old.
The earth, also, in that age, made efforts to produce va­ rious monsters, that sprung up with wonderful faces and limbs;
the hermaphrodite, between both sexes, and not either, but removed from both;
others wanting feet, and others des­ titute of hands;
some also were found dumb for want of a mouth, and some blind without even a face;
and others again were shackled by the cohesion of their limbs over their whole bodies, so that they could neither do any thing, nor go in any direction;
could neither avoid harm, nor take what was ne­ cessary to preserve life.
Other prodigies and portents of this kind she generated ;
but to no purpose;
for nature abhorred and prevented their increase;
nor could they reach the desired maturity of age, or find nutriment, or be united in the pleasures of love.
For we see that many circumstances must concur with other cir­ cumstances, in order that living creatures may be able to pro­ duce their kinds by propagation.
First it is necessary that there be food;
then that there be genial semen throughout the organs, which may flow when the limbs are relaxed in union;
and likewise, for the female to be united with the male, they must both have correspondent members, by which each may combine in mutual delight with the other.
Many kinds of animal life, too, must then have perished, not having been able to continue their species by propagation.
For whatever creatures you see breathing the vital air, assuredly either craft, or courage, or at least activity, has preserved and defended their race from the commencement of its existence.
And there are many which, from their usefulness to mankind, remain, as it were, intrusted to us, and committed to our guardianship.
In the first place, courage has protected the fierce brood of lions, and the savage races of other wild animals;
and craft has secured the fox, as swiftness has saved the stag.
But the light-slumbering breed of dogs, with their faithful affections, and all the various species of horses,1 and the woolly flocks, too, and horned cattle, all these, my dear Memmius, are com­ mitted to the protection of man.
For they have anxiously avoided wild beasts, and have sought peace;
and plenty of subsistence has been provided for them without labour of theirs, which subsistence we secure to them as a reward in return for their service.
But of those to whom nature has given no such qualities, that they should either be able to live of themselves, or to afford us any service, why should we suffer the races to be maintained and protected by our sup­ port ?
Indeed all these, rendered helpless by their own fatal bonds, were exposed as a prey and a prize to other animals, until nature brought their whole species to destruction.
But Centaurs, and such creatures, there neither were, nor ever can be;
for there can never exist an animal formed of a double nature and of two bodies;
an animal made up of such heterogeneous members that the power in the opposite por­ tions of the frame cannot possibly be equal.
This you may learn, with however dull an understanding,1 from the follow­ ing observations.
First, the horse, when three years of his age have passed, is flourishing in full vigour;
the boy, at this time of life, is by no means so, but will even often seek in his sleep the milky teats of his mother's breast.
Afterwards, when, in old age, his lusty vigour and stout limbs are failing the horse, (growing tor­ pid as life is departing,) behold, at that very period, the young manis age being in its flower, youth prevails in him,2 and clothes his cheeks with soft down;
so that you cannot pos­ sibly imagine that Centaurs can be composed or consist of a man and the servile seed of a horse ;
3 or that there can be Scyllæ, of half-marine bodies, cinctured with fierce dogs;
or other monsters of this sort, whose parts we observe to be incompatible with each other;
parts which neither grow up together in their bodies, nor acquire vigour together, nor lose their strength4 together in old age;
and which are neither excited by the same objects of affection, nor agree with the same tempers, nor find that the same kinds of food are nu­ tritious to their bodies.
5
For you may observe that bearded goats often grow fat on hemlock, which to men is rank poison.
Since, too, the flame of fire is accustomed to scorch and burn up the tawny bodies of lions, as well as every kind of creature on earth that consists of flesh and blood, how was it possible that a Chimæra, one animal compounded of three bodies, the fore part a lion, the hinder a dragon, the middle a goat,1 could blow abroad at its mouth a fierce flame out of its body?
For which reason, he who supposes that such animals might have been produced, even when the earth was new and the air fresh, (leaning for argument only on this empty term of newness,) may babble, with equal reason, many other hypo­ theses of a like nature.
He may say that rivers of gold then flowed every where over the earth, and that the groves were accustomed to blossom with jewels;
or that men were formed with such power and bulk of limbs, that they could ex­ tend their steps over the deep seas, and turn the whole heaven around them with their hands.
For though, at the time when the earth first produced animal life, there were in­ numerable seeds of things in the ground, this is yet no proof that creatures could have been generated of mixed natures, and that heterogeneous members of animals could have been blended together.
Since the various kinds of herbs, and fruits, and rich groves, which even now spring-up-exuberantly from the earth, can nevertheless not be produced with a union of different kinds.
But they can readily be produced, if each proceeds in its own order, and all preserve their distinctions according to the fixed law of nature.
And that early race of men upon the earth was much more hardy;
as it was natural that they should be, for the hard earth herself bore them.
They were internally sustained with bones both larger and more solid, and furnished with strong nerves throughout their bodies;
nor were they a race that could easily be injured by heat or cold, or by change of food, or by any corporeal malady.
And during many lustres of the sun, revolving through the heaven, they prolonged their lives after the roving manner of wild beasts.
No one was either a driver of the crooked plough, or knew how to turn up the fields with the spade, or to plant young seedlings in the earth, or to cut, with pruning- hooks, the old boughs from the lofty trees.
That supply which the sun and rain had afforded, or which the earth had yielded of its own accord, sufficiently gratified their desires.
They refreshed themselves, for the most part, among the acorn-laden oaks.
The earth, too, then furnished abundance of whortle- berries,1 even larger than at present, which you now see ripen in winter, and become of a purple colour.
And many rude kinds of nourishment besides, ample for hapless mortals, the florid freshness of the world in those days produced.
The rivers and fountains then invited them to quench their thirst, as the echoing fall of waters from the high hills now calls, far and wide, the thirsty tribes of wild beasts.
After­ wards they occupied the sylvan temples of the nymphs, well known to the wanderers;
from which the goddesses sent forth flowing rills of watery to lave with a copious flood the humid rocks, trickling over the green moss, and to swell and burst forth, with a portion of their streams, over the level plain.
Nor as yet did they understand how to improve their con­ dition by the aid of fire, or to use skins, and to clothe their bodies with the spoils of wild beasts.
But they dwelt in groves, and hollow mountains, and woods;
and, when com­ pelled to flee from the violence of the wind and rain, sheltered their rude limbs amid the thickets.
Nor could they have regard to any common interest, or understand how to observe any customs or laws among them­ selves.
Whatever prize fortune had thrown in the way of any one, on that he seized;
each knowing only to profit by his own instinct, and to live for himself.
And Venus united the persons of lovers in the woods;
for either mutual desire reconciled each female to the intercourse, or the impetuous force and vehement lust of the man over­ came her;
or acorns and whortle-berries, or choice crabs,1 were the purchase of her favours.
And, relying on the extraordinary vigour of their hands and feet, they pursued the sylvan tribes of wild beasts with missile stones and ponderous clubs;
and many they overcame, while a few escaped them in their dens;
and, when surprised by night, they threw their savage limbs, like bristly boars, unprotected on the earth, covering themselves over with leaves and branches.
Nor did they, trembling and wandering in the shades of night, seek to recall the day2 and the sun with loud cries throughout the fields, but, silent and buried in sleep, they waited till Phœbus, with his roseate beams, should again spread light over the heavens.
For since they had always been accustomed, from their infancy, to see darkness and light produced at alternate seasons, it was impossible that they should ever wonder at the change, or feel apprehension lest, the beams of the sun being withdrawn for ever, eternal night should keep possession of the earth.
But what rather gave them trouble, was, that the tribes of wild beasts often disturbed the rest of hapless sleepers;
while, driven from their cell at the approach of a foaming boar or stout lion, they fled from their rocky shelter, and yielded up with trembling, at the dead of night, their couches of leaves to the savage intruders.
Nor yet did the race of men, in those days, leave with la­ mentations the sweet light of life in much greater numbers than at present.
For though more frequently at that period, one individual of their number, being caught by wild beasts, and consumed by their teeth, afforded them living food, and filled, meanwhile, the groves, and mountains, and forests, with his shrieks, as he felt his bowels buried in a living tomb;
1 while those whom flight had saved, with their bodies torn, and pressing their trembling hands over their grievous wounds, called on death with horrid cries, until, destitute of relief, and ignorant what their hurts required, cruel tortures2 deprived them of life.
Yet, in those times, one day did not consign to destruction many thousands of men under military banners;
nor did the boisterous floods of the sea dash ships and men upon rocks.
But the ocean, though often rising and swelling, raged in vain and to no purpose,3 and laid aside its empty threats without effect;
nor could the deceitful allurement of its calm water entice, with its smiling waves, any one into danger;
for the daring art of navigation was then un­ known.
Want of food then consigned languishing bodies to death;
now, on the contrary, abundance of luxuries causes destruction.
The men of those times often poured out poison for themselves unawares;
now persons of their own accord give it craftily to others.
Afterwards, when they procured huts, and skins, and fire, and the woman, united to the man, came to dwell in the same place with him;
and when the pure and pleasing con­ nexions of undivided love were known, and they saw a pro­ geny sprung from themselves;
then first the human race began to be softened and civilized.
For fire now rendered their shivering bodies less able to endure the cold under the canopy of heaven;
and love diminished their strength;
and children with their blandishments easily subdued the ferocious tempers of their parents.
Then, also, neighbours, feeling a mutual friendship, began to form agreements not to hurt or injure one another;
and they commended, with sounds and gestures, their children, and the female sex, to each other's protection;
while they signified, with imperfect speech, that it is right for every one to have compassion on the weak.
Such concord, however, could not be established universally;
but the better and greater part kept their faith inviolate, or the human race would then have been wholly destroyed, and the species could not have continued its generations to the present period.
But nature prompted men to utter the various sounds of the tongue, and convenience drew from them the names of things, almost in the same manner as inability to use the tongue seems to excite children to gesture, when it causes them to point with the finger at objects which are present before them.
For every creature is sensible that it can use its own faculty.
Even before horns are produced on the forehead of a calf, it butts and pushes fiercely with it when enraged;
and the young of panthers, and whelps of lions, contend with their talons, and feet, and teeth, when their teeth and talons are yet scarcely grown.
We see, moreover, that the whole race of birds trust to their wings, and seek a fluttering support from their pinions.
To suppose, therefore, that any one man then assigned names to things, and that men thence learned their first words, is to think absurdly;
for why should this one man be able to dis­ tinguish all things with names, and to utter the varied accents of the voice, and others not be deemed able to do this at the same time ?
Besides, if others had not also used words among themselves, whence was the knowledge of them ingrafted in him ?
Whence was power first given to him, that he should under­ stand, and discern in his mind, what expediency would wish to effect ?
One, likewise, would not be able to compel many, and oblige them, by force, to submit to learn his names of things ;
nor could he by any means teach, or persuade men unfitted to listen, what was necessary to be done ;
for neither would they at all bear with patience, or long suffer him to din­ into their ears, to no purpose, the strange and unintelligible sounds of his voice.
Lastly, what is there so wonderful in this matter, if the human race, whose voice and tongue were in full vigour, dis­ tinguished various objects by sounds, according to their various feelings ;
when dumb cattle, and even the tribes of wild beasts, are wont to utter different and distinct cries when terror or pain affects their hearts, and when joy prevails in them ?
For this you may observe by manifest instances.
When the large flabby jaws of the Molossian dogs begin to growl, as they are irritated, exposing their hard teeth, their violent fury I threatens with a far different sound from that which they utter when they merely bark, and fill all the neigh­ bourhood with yelping.
And when they begin to lick their whelps tenderly with their tongue, or when they fondle them with their paws, and, snapping at them, affect gently to swallow them up with teeth suspended over them, they soothe them with a sort of whining, using their voice far otherwise than when they howl, deserted in lonely buildings, or when, with crouching body, they slink whimpering from beneath a blow.
Again, does not the voice of the horse seem also to differ, when, as a vigorous steed in the flower of his age, and pierced with the goads of winged love, he rages-wildly among the mares;
and when he utters a snorting for war from his ex­ panded nostrils, and thus, with his limbs trembling, neighs in quite other tones ?
1Further, the winged tribes, and various birds, hawks, and eagles,2 and gulls, which, amid the waves of the sea, seek their food and living in the salt water, utter far other cries at other times, than when they contend for sustenance and fight about prey.
Occasionally, also, the long-lived generations of crows, and the flocks of ravens, change their hoarse notes with the weather, when they are said sometimes to call for rain and showers, and sometimes to cry for gales of wind.
If various feelings, therefore, impel the inferior animals, though they are destitute of speech, to utter various sounds, how much more consonant is it to reason, that men, even in those early days, should have been able to distinguish different objects by different names !
And lest, perchance, in reference to these subjects, you should meditate with yourself as to the following point, and be anxious to know the origin offire, I will inform you that light­ ning first brought flame down upon the earth for mortals, and that from thence all the fire in the world!
is spread abroad.
For we even now see many substances, struck with fire from heaven, ignite, when the ethereal region has sent down it3 flames.
Though it is not to be forgotten, indeed, that when a branching tree,2 struck by the winds, is shaken and agitated, moving to and fro, and pressing against the boughs of another tree, fire, excited by the violent friction, is elicited;
so that sometimes, while the branches and stems are rubbed together, a fervid glow of flame bursts forth;
of which causes, accord­ ingly, either might have supplied fire to mankind.
The sun next instructed them to dress their food, and soften it with the heat of flame;
for they saw many things, through­ out the fields, mollified by the force of his beams and subdued by his warmth.
Hence those who excelled in sense, and had power of understanding, taught the others, every day more and more, to change their rude diet,3 and former mode of life, for new practices and improvements by means of fire.
At length the leaders began to build cities, and to found fortresses, as a protection and refuge for themselves.
They also divided the cattle and the fields, and allotted them accord­ ing to the beauty, and strength, and understanding of each in­ dividual;
for beauty was then much esteemed, and strength had great influence.
Afterwards wealth was introduced, and gold brought to light, which easily robbed the strong and beautiful of their honour;
for men, however strong, or en­ dowed with however beautiful a person, generally follow the party of the richer.
But to man, whoever governs his life according to true rea­ son, it is great wealth to live on a little with a contented mind;
for of a little there is no want.
Yet men wished themselves to be honoured and powerful, that their fortune might rest on a steady foundation, and that themselves, being strong, might pass an undisturbed life.
But this they desired in vain;
for, as they strove to reach the hignest honours, they rendered the course of their steps full of trouble.
And still, though they attain their object, envy, like a thunderbolt, hurls them at times from their pre-eminence, and sinks them with scorn as into the gloom of Tartarus;
so that it is far better to obey in quiet, than to seek to hold states under our sway, and to manage kingdoms.
Let men, therefore, if they will, sweat out their life's blood,1 wearying themselves to no purpose, and struggling along the narrow road of ambition;
(for the highest objects, and whatever are more exposed on eminences,2 are generally sooner scorched with envy as well as with lightning;
) since they gather knowledge only from the mouths of others, and pursue things rather from what they hear than from their own judgments.
Nor does this folly prevail more now, or will it prevail more hereafter, than it has already prevailed in past time.
Kings, therefore,3 being deposed and slain, the ancient ma­ jesty of their thrones, and their proud sceptres, lay overthrown in the dust;
and the illustrious ornament of the royal head, stained with blood beneath the feet of the rabble, mourned the loss of its supreme honour;
for that which has been too much feared before, is eagerly trodden down.
Power, accordingly, returned to the lowest dregs and rabble of mankind, whilst each sought dominion and eminence for himself.
But at length the Miser part taught them to establish a government, and made lawsfor them, that they might consent to observe order;
for mankind, weary of passing their lives in a state of violence, were worn out with contentions ;
on which account they fell more submissively under the power of laws and strict ordinances.
For because every one, in his resent­ ment, prepared to take revenge for himself more severely than is now allowed by equitable laws, men, for this reason.
be­ came disgusted with living in strife.
Since, from this source, the fear of punishment poisons the enjoyments of life;
for violence and injury involve every one, and generally recoil upon the head of him from whom they arose ;
nor is it possible for any one to live a quiet and peaceable life, who violates by his actions the common bonds of peace.
For though his guilt escape, for a time, the knowledge of both gods and men, yet he cannot feel sure that it will always be hidden;
since many, speaking frequently in dreams, or being delirious in sickness, are said to have revealed their secrets, and to have published to the world long-concealed crimes.
In the next place, what cause spread abroad, throughout the wide nations of the earth, the notion of the existence and power of the gods, and filled cities with altars, and led solemn sacred rites to be instituted;
(which sacred rites now flourish and are performed on all important occasions and in all distinguished places;
) whence also terror pervades mortals;
a terror which raises new temples of the deities throughout the whole globe of the earth, and impels men to celebrate their worship on feast days;
it is not so difficult, as it may seem, to explain.
1
For, in those early times of which we speak, the tribes of mortals beheld in their minds, even when awake, glorious images as of gods,2 and saw them, in their sleep, still more dis­ tinctly, and of a wondrous magnitude of figure.
To these, therefore, they attributed vitality, because they seemed to move their limbs, and to utter majestic words, suitable to their dis­ tinguished appearance and mighty strength.
And they as­ signed to them an immortal existence, because their appear­ ances came-in-constant-succession, and their form remained the same;
although they might certainly have deemed them immortal on another account?
as they would consider that beings, endowed with such apparent strength, could not easily be subdued by any destructive force.
And they thought them pre-eminent in happiness, because the fear of death could thus trouble none of them, and because, at the same time, they saw them, in their dreams, do many and wonderful actions, and ex­ perience, as it seemed, no difficulty in the performance of them.
Besides, they observed the revolutions of the heavens, and the various seasons of the year, go round in a certain order, and yet could not understand by what causes these effects were produced.
They had, then, this resource for themselves, to ascribe all things to gods, and to make all things be guided by their will.
And the seats and abodes1 of these gods they placed in the sky, because through the sky the night and the moon are seen to revolve;
the moon, I say, the day, and the night, and the august constellations2 of night, and the nocturnal luminaries of the heavens, and the flying meteors, as well as the clouds, the sun, rain, snow, winds, lightnings, hail, and the vehement noises and loud threatening murmurs of the thunder.
O unhappy race of men as they attributed such acts, be­ sides ascribing bitter wrath, to the gods!
What lamentations did they then prepare for themselves, and what sufferings for us!
what fears have they entailed upon our posterity!
Nor is it any piety for a man to be seen, with his head veiled, turning towards a stone, and drawing near to every altar;
or to fall prostrate on the ground, and to stretch out his hands before the shrines of the gods;
or to sprinkle the altars with copious blood of four-footed beasts, and to add vows to vows;
but it is rather piety to be able to contemplate all things with a serene mind.
For when we look up to the celestial regions of the vast world above, and contemplate the firmament studded with glittering stars, and reflect upon the revolutions of the sun and moon, the apprehension lest there should, perchance, be an almighty power of the gods above us, which guides the stars in their various motions, begins then to raise its head, as if awaking, within our breast;
an apprehension which, perhaps, before lay dormant under the weight of other cares.
Since poverty of reason, and ignor­ ance of natural causes, disquiet the mind, while it doubts whether there was any birth or commencement of the world, or whether there is any limit of time, until which the walls of the world,1 and the silent movements of the heavenly bodies, can endure this incessant labour;
or whether the heavens, di­ vinely endowed with an imperishable nature, can, as they roll along time’s eternal course, defy the mighty power of endless age.
Besides, whose heart does not shrink at the terrors of the gods ?
Whose limbs do not shudder with dread, when the scorched earth trembles with the awful stroke of lightning, and when the roars of thunder pervade the vast heaven ?
Do not people and nations tremble ?
And do not proud monarchs, penetrated with fear of the deities, recoil in every nerve, lest, for some foul deed, or arrogant word, the dread time of pay­ ing penalty be come ?
When, likewise, the mighty force of a tempestuous wind, raging over the sea, sweeps athwart the deep the commander of a fleet with all his powerful legions and elephants,2 does he not solicit peace of the gods with vows, and timidly im­ plore them with prayers, for a lull of the winds and a pros­ perous gale ?
But, alas !
he implores them to no purpose;
for, frequently, seized by a violent hurricane, he is neverthe­ less borne away to the shoals of death.
Thus some unseen power, apparently, bears upon human things, and seems to trample down proud fasces and cruel axes, and make them merely a sport for itself.
Further, when the whole earth totters under our feet, and cities, shaken to their base, fall or threaten to fall, what wonder is it, that the nations of the world despise and humble them­ selves, and admit the vast influence of the gods over the world, and their stupendous power to govern all things ?
Moreover, brass, and gold,3 and iron were discovered, as well as heavy silver, and the substance of lead,1 at a time when fire had consumed mighty forests upon the high mountains, either from lightning having been hurled upon them, or because men, warring among themselves in the woods, had set fire to them for a terror to their enemies;
or else because, moved by the goodness of the soil, they wished to lay open fertile fields, and to render the country fit for pasturage;
or because they sought to kill the wild beasts, and to enrich themselves with their spoils.
For to catch the game by means of pitfalls and fire, became a practice before men surrounded the forest with nets, or roused the animals with dogs.
However this may be, or from whatever cause the rage of the fire, with frightful noise, had consumed the woods from their deepest roots, and had melted the earth with heat, there flowed from the boiling veins, uniting in the hollow places of the soil, a stream of silver and gold, as well as of brass and lead ;
which, when they afterwards saw it congealed, and shining with a bright colour on the ground, they took up, being attracted by its glittering and smooth lustre;
and they observed that the masses were formed of the same shape as the figure of the receptacle of each had been.
It then occur­ red to them, that these metals, being melted with heat, might settle into any form or figure of things, and might also be fashioned, by beating out, into the sharpest and finest points of instruments, so that they might make tools for themselves, and be able both to cut down the woods, and hew timber, and smooth and polish boards, as well as to pierce, excavate, and bore.
These instruments they at first attempted to make of silver and gold, no less than of the strong substance of hard brass;
but in vain;
for the consistence of those metals yielded and gave way, and both were alike unable to bear severe usage Accordingly brass was then more in esteem, and gold was neglected on account of its uselessness, as taking only a dull edge and blunt point;
now brass is despised, and gold has succeeded to the highest honours.
For thus revolving time changes the seasons of things;
that which was once in estimation, becomes of no repute at all;
while another thing succeeds, and bursts forth from contempt;
1 something which is daily more and more sought, and which, when found, flour­ ishes among mankind with special praise and wonderful honour.
It is now easy for thee to understand of thyself, my Mem­ mius, how the nature and use of iron were discovered.
The first weapons of mankind were the hands, nails, and teeth ;
also stones, and branches of trees, the fragments of the woods;
then flame and fire were used, as soon as they were known;
and lastly was discovered the strength of iron and brass.
But the use of brass was known earlier than that of iron;
inasmuch as its substance is more easy to work, and its abundance greater.
2
With brass they turned up the soil of the earth ;
and with brass they excited the tumults of war, and inflicted deep wounds, and took away the cattle and lands of their neighbours;
for every thing unarmed and defenceless easily surrendered to those that were armed.
Then gradu­ ally came forth the sword of steel, and the form of the brazen pruning-hook was turned into contempt.
With iron they began to cleave the ground, and the contests of doubtful war­ fare were made equal.
And it appears that man mounted armed upon the back of a horse, and guided it with reins, and exerted his right hand to fight, before he tried the hazards of war in a two-horsed chariot.
It also doubtless occurred earlier to yoke two horses than four, or than to mount in full armour on chariots equipped with scythes.
In process of time the Carthaginians taught fierce elephants,3 with towers on their backs, and with snake- like proboscis, to endure the wounds of war, and to throw vast martial battalions into confusion.
Thus sad discord produced one invention after another, to spread terror in battle among the tribes of men, and added daily increase to the horrors of contention.
They tried bulls, also, in the business of war, and endea­ voured to impel fierce boars against the enemy.
The Parthi­ ans, too, sent strong lions before them, with armed keepers and daring guides, to govern them and hold them in chains.
But such attempts were in vain ;
for the savage beasts, heated with tumultuous slaughter, and shaking their terrible manes on every side, disordered all troops without distinction.
Nor could the riders soothe the spirits of their horses, which were alarmed at the roaring of the lions, and turn them with the reins against the enemy.
The lions, in their rage, threw themselves with leaps among the soldiers in every part;
they flew at the faces of those who came against them, and seized on others from behind unawares, and, clasping them round about, threw them to the earth sinking under wounds, clinging to them with their strong teeth and hooked talons.
The bulls tossed their own people, and trampled them under foot;
they gored with their horns the sides of the horses, and their bellies underneath, and tore up the earth with alarming fury.
But the boars killed their own friends with strong tusks, staining, in their rage, the broken darts with their blood, and spread promiscuous destruction among cavalry and infantry.
For though the horses, leaping aside, shunned the fierce attacks of their teeth, or, rearing up, pawed the air with their feet, yet they struggled to no purpose;
since you might have seen them sink down hamstrung, and cover the earth with a heavy fall.
Whatever beasts they thought suffi­ ciently tame at home, they saw, in the heat of action, mad­ dened with wounds, cries, flight, terror, and tumult.
Nor could they recall any portion of them to order;
for all the different kinds of beasts scattered themselves abroad;
as ele­ phants even now, when imperfectly inured to weapons, flee hither and thither, after having inflicted much cruel damage on their masters.
Thus, and with these views, it is possible that they might act.
But I am scarcely inclined to think that they could not originally foresee, and consider in their minds, how general and calamitous an evil such warfare would prove to succeeding times.
But they were willing to adopt1 this practice, not so much with the hope of conquering, as to cause annoyance to the enemy;
and men who distrusted their numbers, and were without efficient arms, naturally grew desperate, and were ready to perish themselves, if they might but destroy their op­ ponents.
The garment of skins, fastened together, existed before the woven dress ;
the woven succeeded the discovery of iron;
for by iron weaving is performed.
Nor, indeed, of any other mate­ rial can instruments of such smoothness as treadles, spindles, shuttles, and rattling yarn-beams, be produced.
And nature obliged men to work in wool before women;
for all the male sex far excel in art, and are much more inge­ nious than the female.
This state of things continued until the sturdy husbandmen made it a reproach to the workers in wool;
making them consent to resign it to the hands of women, and themselves to endure hard labour together with the tillers of the ground, and strengthen their limbs and hands with severe toil.
But of sowing and planting,2 and of grafting, nature, the great producer of all things, was herself the first example and origin.
For berries and acorns that fell from the trees, ex­ hibited, in the proper season, a crop of seedlings underneath ;
from observing which they also ventured to intrust slips to the boughs, and to plant young stocks throughout the fields.
They then tried different methods of tilling the kindly soil, and saw wild fruits become improved in their lands by being cherished and indulgently cultivated.
And they com­ pelled the woods to withdraw daily farther up the mountains, and to give room below for tillage;
so that they might have meadows, lakes, rivulets, corn-fields, and rich vineyards throughout the hills and plains, and that a green tract of olives, marking the ground, might run between other trees, stretching far over the heights, and valleys, and plains;
as you now see all gardens distinguished with varied beauty, which, intersected with rows of dulcet apples, men lay out and adorn, and which they keep planted around with other fruit trees.
But to imitate with the mouth the liquid voices of birds1 was practised long before men could play melodious tunes, and delight the ear with music.
The whistling of the zephyr through the empty reeds first taught the rustics to blow through hollow stalks.
Then by degrees they learned the sweet plaintive notes, which the pipe, pressed by the fingers of the players, pours forth;
the pipe, which is now found through all the pathless groves, and woods, and glades, through the solitary haunts, and divine resting-places,2 of the shepherds.
Thus time by degrees suggests every discovery, and skill evolves it into the regions of light and fame.
These melodies softened the hearts of those swains, and de­ lighted them when they were satisfied with food;
for then every thing affords pleasure.
Oftentimes, therefore, stretched upon the soft grass, near a rivulet of water, under the boughs of a high tree, they socially, though with no great wealth, gratified their senses with pleasure, especially when the weather smiled upon them, and the seasons of the year painted the green herbage with flowers.
Then jests, and pleasant talk, and agreeable laughter, were wont to be enjoyed;
for then the rustic muse had full vigour and influence.
Then sportive gaiety prompted them to deck their heads and shoulders with garlands of flowers and leaves, and to stand forth in irregular dances, moving their limbs stiffly, and to stamp on mother earth with heavy foot;
whence arose smiles and jocund laughter, because all these exhibitions had then greater effect, as being new and wonderful.
Hence to produce various modulations of voice, and to weave tunes, and to run over the reeds with compressed lips, were compensations for want of sleep, as they watched during the night.
From whom, also the men of the present day, wakeful in nocturnal orgies, have received and maintain the same practices,1 and have learned to preserve regularity of numbers ;
and yet they do not, even now, enjoy their amusement with greater delight than that which the sylvan sons of earth then experienced.
For that gratification which is present, if we have pre. viously known nothing more agreeable, delights us pre-emi­ nently, and seems to be superior to every thing else;
but any thing better, which is discovered afterwards, blunts and alters our feelings as to all we enjoyed before.
Thus dislike of acorns came upon mankind;
thus those ancient beds, formed of grass and leaves, were abandoned.
Skins, too, and the savage dress, fell into contempt;
a dress of which I can imagine the discovery to have excited such envy,2 that he who first wore it, possibly died from a treacherous-combination against him;
and that his garment, being torn, with much bloodshed, among those who slew him, was at last spoiled, and rendered incapable of being used.
In those days skins, in these gold and purple, disturb the life of men with cares, and harass it with war.
In which re­ gard, as I think, blame has fallen far more justly on us than on them.
For cold tormented the uncovered children of earth, when they were without skins ;
but to be destitute of a purple garment, adorned with gold and cumbrous figures, causes no in­ convenience to us, provided that we have, instead of it, a com­ mon dress that may defend us against the weather.
The human race, accordingly, labour perpetually in vain and to no purpose, and consume their life in empty cares;
evidently because they do not know what is the proper limit to acquisi­ tion, and how far real pleasure extends:
and this ignorance has gradually carried them into a sea of evils, and thorough­ ly aroused the mighty tumults of war.
But the wakeful and untiring sun and moon, that illumine with their light the vast revolving region of the heaven, taught mankind that the seasons of the year proceed, and that every thing is carried on, by a certain Jaw and in a certain order.
They afterwards passed their lives defended with strong fortresses, and the earth, divided and marked out, was culti­ vated and peopled.
The sea was next covered with ships for the sake of per­ fumes.
1 Men had auxiliaries and allies, with settled treaties.
The poets now began to hand down great deeds in their poems;
letters had only a short time before been discovered.
Hence our age cannot trace what previously occurred, except so far as reason gives indications.
Ships, and the culture of land, walls of cities, laws, arms, roads, garments, and other things of this kind ;
all the bless­ ings and all the delights of life;
poems, pictures, and artfully­ wrought statues, improving use,2 and the experience of the active mind, proceeding step by step, taught all mankind gradually to adopt.
Thus time by degrees suggests every discovery, and skill evolves it into the regions of light and celebrity.
Thus, in the various arts, we see that different inventions proceed from different minds, until they reach the highest point of excel­ lence.
LUCRETIUS commences with a panegyric on Athens, as the inventress and promoter of useful and elegant arts, and especially as the birth-place of Epicurus, whom he again extols, ver. 1—42.
He then proceeds to treat of meteoric appearances in the heavens, and, lest men should be terrified at thunder, as proceeding from Jupiter, asserts that it arises entirely from natural causes, ver. 43—95.
It is produced by the collision, or disruption, or corrasion of clouds, ver. 96—120;
or from other causes, ver. 121— 159.
Lightning, he says, is fire forced out of clouds, either by their collision, or by the force of winds, ver. 160—218.
Of the nature and origin of the thunderbolt, ver. 219—322.
Of its swiftness, and that of lightning, and why storms are more prevalent at the equinoxes, ver. 323—378.

Of the origin and cause of diseases, ver. 1089—1136;
with a full description of the plague that depopulated Athens during the Peloponnesian war ver. 1137—1285.IN early days, Athens, of illustrious name, first communi­ cated to suffering mortals the method of producing corn ;
Athens, also, first improved life, and established laws;
Athens, moreover, first afforded sweet consolations of existence, when she gave birth to that pre-eminent MAN, endowed with such mighty genius, who once poured forth instruction on all sub­ jects from his truth-speaking mouth;
and whose fame, spread abroad of old on account of his discoveries, is raised, since his death, even to the skies.
For when he observed that almost all things, which neces­ sity requires for subsistence, and by which mankind may render life free from care, are already prepared for them by nature, yet saw that men may abound in wealth, may be crowned with honour and applause, and may have pride in the good fame of their children, but that, notwithstanding, there may be griefs in the heart of each at home, and each may disquiet life with unhappy querulousness of mind, he understood, at once, the cause which compels them to lament with such troublesome complaints;
he perceived that the vessel itself was in fault, and that all good things which were collected and brought into it from abroad, were spoiled by its imperfection within;
he was convinced of this, partly because he saw that it was unsound and perforated, so that it could never by any means be filled;
and partly because he found that it contami­ nated with an offensive taste, as it were, all things that it had received within it.
He therefore purged the minds of men with the words of truth, and set bounds to desire and fear;
he explained what is the chief good at which we all aim, and showed the way, in a narrow track, by which we may in a straight course arrive at it.
And he taught what evil pre­ vails every where in human affairs, which flows and arises variously, either from casual accident, or from necessity, ac­ cording as nature has appointed;
and he showed from what portals each ought to be met,2 and proved that mankind re- volve in their breasts, for the most part unnecessarily, the sorrowful tumults of care.
For as children tremble,1 and fear every thing in thick darkness, so we, in the light, fear sometimes things which are not more to be feared than those which children dread, and imagine about to happen, in the dark.
This terror of the mind, therefore, it is not the rays of the sun, or the bright arrows of day, that must dispel, but the contemplation of nature and the exercise of reason.
For which cause, I shall more carefully proceed to complete, with some further observations, the undertaking which I have in hand.
And since I have shown that the regions of the world are mortal, and that the heaven consists of substance generated and perishable, and that whatever things are produced, and must necessarily be produced, within it, are for the most part necessarily dissolved ;
attend now to what further remains to be said;
since his friends once more exhort the charioteer to ascend his stately chariot,2 testifying-by-their-applause, that all things which before were adverse to his course, are now altered through their gentle favour.
But the phœnomena which men observe3 to occur in the earth and the heavens, when, as often happens, they are per­ plexed with fearful thoughts, overawe their minds with a dread of the gods, and humble and depress them to the earth;
for ignorance of natural causes obliges them to refer all things to the power of the divinities, and to resign the dominion of the world to them;
because of these effects they can by no means see the origin, and accordingly suppose that they are produced by divine influence.
For if those who have fairly understood that the gods pass a life free from care, neverthe­ less wonder, meanwhile, how things can severally be carried on, especially in those matters which are seen in the ethereal regions above our heads, they are carried back again to their old notions of religion, and set over themselves cruel tyrants whom they unhappily believe able to do all things ;
being themselves ignorant what can and what cannot be done;
and ' by what means limited power, and a deeply fixed boundary, is assigned to every thing.
On which account, through their own blind reasoning, they are led away more and more into error.
Such fancies unless you expel from your mind, and put far from you unworthy thoughts of the gods,1 and cease to har­ hour notions inconsistent with their tranquillity, the sacred power of the divinities will often, as being offended by you,2 obstruct your peace ;
3 not that the supreme majesty of the dei­ ties can really be violated, so that it should seek, through anger, to inflict severe punishment;
but because you yourself, when you might be calm in tranquil peace, will suppose that the gods cherish vast floods of wrath against you;
nor will you ap­ proach the temples of the deities with a heart at ease, nor be able to admit into your mind, with placid serenity of contem­ plation, those images which are borne from the sacred persons of the gods,1 as indications of their divine beauty, into the breasts of mankind.
Hence you may conceive what sort of life would follow such a belief.
And although many observations have been made by me, to the end that true wisdom may repel such a life far from us, many more still remain to be added, and to be recommended by smooth verse;
and the nature of things above US,2 and of the heaven, is to be understood.
Tempests, and bright lightnings, are to be sung;
their nature is to be told, and from what cause they pursue their course;
lest, having foolishly divided the heaven into parts,3 you should be anxious as to the quarter from which the flying flame may come, or to what region it may betake itself;
and tremble to think how it penetrates through walled enclosures, and how, having exercised its power, it extricates itself from them.
Of which phænomena the multitude can by no means see the causes, and think that they are accomplished by supernatural power.
Thou, 0 skilful muse Calliope, solace of men, and pleasure of gods, mark out my path for me, as I run to the white goal at the end of the course,4 that, under thy guidance, I may at­ tain a crown with distinguished applause.
In the first place, the blue skies are convulsed with thun- der, because the clouds in the air, as they fly along on high, when winds are opposed to each other, meet together in collision.
For in a clear part of the sky no noise takes place.
But the more densely the clouds are collected, in any quarter whatso­ ever, with so much louder a noise does the thunder frequently proceed from that quarter.
The clouds, too, it is to be observed, can neither be of so dense a substance as stones and wood are;
nor again, of so subtle a consistence as flying mists and smoke are.
For, in the one case, they would either fall, being brought down by their own dead weight, or, in the other, they would, like smoke, be unable to keep together, or to retain within them the cold snows and showers of hail.
Clouds also produce a sound,1 by certain motions, athwart the regions of the open sky, as canvass, stretched over the large theatres, makes a noise when it is tossed about among the posts and beams.
Sometimes a cloud is ruffled and torn in pieces by boisterous winds, and then imitates the rattling noise of paper;
for that kind of crackling you may also ob­ serve in thunder.
Or it sounds as when the winds shake with their blasts a hanging garment, or flying sheets of parch­ ment, and rattle them in the air.
It sometimes happens, moreover, that clouds cannot so much come into collision front to front, as meet side to side, rubbing their masses slowly against one another, with various movements;
whence that dry kind of sound, which you may sometimes observe, strikes upon the ear, and which is pro­ tracted for some time, until the clouds have escaped from the confined space.
Thus too, not unfrequently, all things around, convulsed with violent thunder, seem to tremble, and the mighty walls of the capacious world appear at once to have started and burst asunder;
and this happens when a collected body of strong wind has suddenly involved itself within a cloud, and, being shut up there, forces the cloud, (as the whirling air stretches it more and more in all directions,) to become hollow, but with a thick crust round the cavity.
Afterwards, when the strong force and spirit of the wind within has fermented, it at length, being emitted from confinement, gives a crack, with a frightfully-crashing sound.
Nor is this surprising, when a small bladder, filled with air, often produces, if sud­ denly burst, a loud sound of a similar kind.
There is also another reason why the winds, when they blow among the clouds, may produce a sound;
for we often see branched and rough clouds carried about in the air in various directions.
So that such a noise may arise in the clouds as when the north-west gales blow through a thick wood, and the leaves make a rustling and the boughs crackle.
It happens, likewise, at times, that the vehement force of a strong blast tears a cloud asunder, cleaving it through with a straight-forward assault.
For what the wind may effect in the sky, manifest experience demonstrates on the earth, where, though it is less violent, it often overthrows and tears up lofty woods from their lowest roots.
There are also waves in the clouds, which, breaking hea­ vily, make a murmuring noise;
such as is likewise excited in deep rivers, and in the vast sea, when it is broken and rages with the tide.
It occurs, moreover, that when the burning violence of lightning passes from one cloud into another, the second cloud, if it receives the fire into a large body of moisture, imme­ diately extinguishes it with a loud noise;
as hot iron, taken from a glowing furnace, hisses when we plunge it into the cold water standing near.
Further, if a cloud, which is more dry than ordinary, re­ ceives the lightning, it is at once set on fire, and scorched up with a loud sound;
such as is heard if a flame, on any occa­ sion, spreads over hills covered with laurel, burning it up with great fury, and impelled by a storm of wind.
Nor does any substance burn with a more startling sound, as the flame crackles among its boughs, than the Delphic laurel of Phœbus.
In addition, we may observe that a great crashing of ice, and fall of hail, among the vast clouds in the sky, frequently produce a loud sound.
For masses of cloud, closely con­ densed, and mixed with hail, are, when the wind compresses them, shattered and broken to pieces.
It lightens, also, when the clouds, by their collision, have struck out numerous atoms of fire;
just as if a stone strikes another stone, or a piece of iron;
for then, in like manner, a light bursts forth, and scatters abroad bright sparks of fire.
But it always happens that we hear the sound of the thun­ der some time after we perceive it lighten,1 because objects, which affect the hearing, always come more slowly to the ears, than those, which affect the sight, arrive at the eye.
This you may easily understand from the following instance.
If you observe a man at a distance cutting down the trunk of a tree with an axe, you will see the stroke itself before the noise of the stroke makes any sound in the air.
So, too, we see the lightning before we hear the thunder, which, however, is emitted at the same time with the flash, and produced from the same collision of the clouds.
Clouds, likewise, sometimes tinge the parts around with swiftly-diffused light, and the storm gleams with tremulous ardour, from the following cause:
when wind has penetrated a cloud, and, rolling about within it, has made the cloud (as I showed above) become hollow in the middle, and condensed round about, it acquires heat by its own activity, as you see all bodies glow when made warm by motion;
and a ball of lead, from being whirled2 through a long space, even melts.
This hot wind, accordingly, when it has burst a dark cloud, suddenly scatters atoms of heat, which are, as it were, driven out by its violence, and which cause the vibrating gleams of the lightning.
Then follows the noise, which affects the ear more slowly than the beams which come to our eyes3 strike them.
This, you will understand, takes place when the clouds are condensed, and when they are piled, at the same time, high above one another, with extraordinary effect.
1
And do not be misled by the circumstance, that we, from below, see more plainly how broad the clouds are, than how high they are built up.
For observe their appearance, when the winds will carry these clouds, resembling great mountains, along through the air;
or when you shall see, on the sides of high hills, some clouds piled upon others, and those placed in the upper region, while the winds are buried in repose, press­ ing down those in the lower;
and you will then be able to comprehend their vastness of bulk, and observe the caverns within them, which are formed as it were of hanging rocks;
and when the winds, at the rising of a tempest, have filled them, the winds themselves, being thus confined within the clouds, complain with a loud murmuring, and utter threats like wild beasts in dens.
Sometimes they send their roarings in one direction, and sometimes in another, through the clouds, and, seeking an outlet, turn themselves about, and roll to­ gether atoms of fire from the cloudy-masses;
and thus they collect many igneous particles, and whirl about the flames within as in hollow furnaces, until, the cloud having burst, they dart forth with a flash.
From this cause, also, it happens, that that gleaming golden colour of liquid fire flies down upon the earth;
inasmuch as the clouds themselves must of necessity contain many atoms of fire ;
as, when they are without any moisture, their colour is generally fiery and shining.
For they must receive many igneous particles from the light of the sun, so that they na­ turally look red, and send forth fire.
When, therefore, the wind, driving them along, has thrust, compressed, and con­ densed them into one place, they pour forth the atoms offire, which are squeezed out, and which cause the colour of flame to shine through the sky.
It likewise lightens when the clouds in heaven are rare­ fied.
For when the wind gently divides and attenuates them as they pass, those atoms, which cause the lightning, must fall even in spite of them;
and then it lightens without any great terror, or sounds, or commotion.
Of what nature, moreover,1 the lightning consists, its strokes, and the signs and marks which are burnt into objects by its fire, and which exhale a strong scent of sulphur, sufficiently indicate.
For these are tokens of fire, and not of wind or rain.
Besides, lightnings often set on fire the roofs of houses, and revel with a swift flame throughout houses themselves.
For nature has formed this attenuated fire, you may be sure,2 of the most minute particles of flame, and with the subtlest mo­ tions and atoms, so that nothing whatever can resist it.
Pow­ erful lightning, indeed, passes through the walls of houses like sounds and voices;
it passes through stones and brass, and melts brass and gold in a moment.
It causes wine, also, to flow out suddenly from vessels which still remain entire;
because, as is evident, its heat, at its contact, easily relaxes and expands all the earthen-substance of the vessel ;
3 so that, penetrating into the liquid itself, it actively separates and dis­ pels the atoms of the wine;
agitating it with its flashing heat to a degree which the warmth of the sun seems unable to pro­ duce in an age;
so much more active and forcible is this in­ fluence oflightning.
How these lightnings are generated, and become possessed of such force, that they can split towers with a stroke, overturn houses, tear away beams and planks, demolish and scatter abroad the monuments of heroes, deprive men of life, destroy whole herds of cattle at once;
and with what power they can effect all other things of this kind, I will now proceed to ex­ plain, nor will I delay you longer with promises.
1
It must be admitted that lightnings are produced from clouds that are dense, and piled high in the air;
for none are ever emitted from a clear sky, or from clouds that are but thinly collected.
For doubtless manifest observation shows this to be the case;
because, at the time when thunder is heard, the clouds are condensed from all sides through the whole atmo­ sphere, so that we might suppose all the darkness to have left Acheron, and to have filled the immense vault of heaven;
so formidably, when the dire gloom of storms has collected, and when the tempest begins to forge its thunderbolts, does the face of black terror impend over the earth from above.
Over the sea, too, very frequently, a black stormy cloud, like a flood of pitch flowing down from heaven, so terribly descends upon the waters, and rolls onward in such thick darkness, and draws with it a black tempest so pregnant with thunder and hurricanes, (being charged, too, to the utmost with fire and wind,) that even men upon land shudder and seek shelter in their houses.
Thus, therefore, we must believe that tempestuous-clouds rise high above our heads;
for neither could clouds overwhelm the earth with such thick darkness, (the sun being wholly obscured,) unless they were built up, numbers upon numbers, to a great height;
nor could they, when descending in rain, deluge the earth with such vast showers, as to make the rivers overflow, and the plains a sheet of water, unless the atmosphere contained clouds ranged high over one another.
In the air, therefore, at the time of storms, all parts of the clouds are replete with wind and fire;
and thus thunders and lightnings are produced.
For I have shown above that the hollow clouds must contain many atoms of heat;
and they must also of necessity receive many from the rays and warmth of the sun.
Thus, when the same wind, which has collected the clouds by chance into any one place, has elicited from them many atoms of heat, and with that heat has mingled itself, the vortex of ''ind, compressed within the cloud, whirls itself about in it, and sharpens the lightning, as in a hot furnace, within its depths.
For this wind is heated in two ways;
it both grows warm by its own motion, and by the contact of fire.
Then, when the substance of the wind has grown hot of itself, or the strong influence of fire has excited it, the lightning, being ripe as it were, bursts suddenly through the cloud, and the fiery gleam is roused and driven forth,1 illumining all places with vibrating light;
close upon which follows the awful crash2 of thunder, so that the regions of heaven above seem suddenly to be disruptured, and to totter.
Tremor then violently pervades the earth, and murmurs run along the lofty skies;
for almost all the stormy air then trembles with the shock, and loud noises are sent forth;
after which concus­ sion follows heavy and abundant rain, so that the whole sky seems to be turned into showers, and thus, falling precipitately, to excite the waters to a new deluge.
3
So mighty a sound issues forth from the displosion of a cloud, and from a tempest of wind, when the lightning flies abroad with its burning impetus.
Sometimes, too,4 the vehement force of the wind falls upon a dense cloud externally, striking on its summit just ripe for explosion;
5 and, when it has burst through it, there flies out instantly the fiery vortex6 which we, in our native language, call lightning.
And this is not confined to one point only, but extends to other parts, wheresoever the force of the wind has diffused itself.
It happens at times, also, that a furious wind, though issu­ ing forth without fire, yet ignites as it goes, in a long space, and protracted flight;
losing, too, in its course, some of those larger atoms which cannot penetrate through the air equally with the smaller;
and collecting from the air itself, as it flies through it, some of those minute particles which, when mixed, generate fire;
almost in the same manner as a ball of lead very frequently grows hot in its course, when, throwing off many atoms of cold, it conceives heat in the atmosphere.
It occurs, moreover, that the force of a mere stroke excites fire in a cloud, when a cold blast of wind, darting forth with­ out any fire at all, has struck upon it;
because as is evident, when the wind has dashed against the cloud with a violent impetus, atoms of heat may flow both from the wind itself, and also from that cloudy substance which then receives its impact;
just as fire flies out when we strike a stone with iron;
nor, because the substance of iron is cold, do those par­ ticles of igneous brightness the less, on that account, flow together at the stroke.
Thus any substance, likewise, must naturally be kindled by lightning, if it be adapted and dis­ posed to take fire.
Nor can the substance of the wind be easily supposed to be altogether cold, considering its rapid flight from the parts whence it was so forcibly discharged from above;
1 for though it be not kindled by heat in its descent before it arrives in these lower regions, it yet comes to them tepid and mixed with warmth.
But the activity and impulse of the lightning are so great as you observe them to be, and the thunderbolts in general fly with so swift a descent, because the force of the wind, when roused, first collects itself fully within the clouds, and makes a great struggle to issue forth.
Then, when the cloud can no longer restrain the increased-violence of its efforts, its fury bursts out, and flies, accordingly, with wonderful impe­ tus, like darts which are hurled from powerful engines.
Add to this, that it consists of small and smooth particles;
nor is it easy for any body to withstand so subtle a substance;
for it winds and penetrates through the most minute pas­ sages.
It is not, therefore, checked or delayed1 by many obstacles, and it accordingly flies and spreads with the most active swiftness.
Consider, further, that all bodies universally tend down­ wards by nature;
and that, when an impulse is added, the swiftness is doubled, and the force aggravated;
so that what­ ever obstacles oppose its power, it but the sooner and more vigorously scatters them with a stroke, and pursues its own course.
Besides, that which comes to the earth with a long flight, must acquire speed;
which continually increases2 by progres­ sion, and augments its vehement impetus, and gives force to its stroke.
For its velocity causes whatever atoms there are in the body, to be borne forward,3 as it were, straight to one point, combining them all, as they roll on, in that single direction.
Perhaps the lightning, too, may, in its passage through the sky, attract to itself certain particles from the air, which may increase the violence of its strokes.
And it passes through substances that remain uninjured, and penetrates many objects that continue unaltered, because the liquid fire finds a passage into them by the pores.
And many bodies it rends asunder, when the atoms of the lightning strike against the atoms of their substances, where they are held in close contexture.
It moreover easily dissolves brass, and melts gold in a mo­ ment, because its substance consists of infinitely small parti­ cles, and of atoms that are smooth, which easily penetrate bodies, and, when they have penetrated, suddenly dissolve all connexions, and loosen all bonds.
The vault of heaven,1 studded with glittering stars, are the whole earth round about, are shaken with thunder in autumn, and when the flowery season of spring displays it­ self, more than at other times.
For in winter heat is deficient;
and in summer the winds fail, and the clouds are not of so dense a consistence.
But when the seasons of the year are between the two, all the various causes of thunder then con­ cur.
For the intermediate-portion of the year2 blends the cold and the heat, both of which are necessary to produce thunder for us;
so that, for the generation of it, there may be a discord in things, and that the atmosphere, raging with heat and wind, may be agitated with a vast tumult.
For the be­ ginning of summer, and the end of winter, is the season of spring;
from which cause the two dissimilar natures, heat and cold, must at that time jar with one another, and produce a commotion as they mingle.
And the termination of summer comes on, meeting the commencement of winter;
at a time which is called the season of autumn;
and then, too, violent colds contend with violent heats.
These seasons may, there­ fore, be styled the WAR-TIMES OF THE YEAR.3
Nor is it wonderful if, at these conjunctures, much thunder-and-light­ ning takes place, and if tumultuous tempests are excited in the sky, since there arises disturbance from doubtful strife on either hand;
beat contending on the one side, and winds, mingled with rain, on the other.
This is the way to learn the true nature of igneous light ning, and to understand by what power it produces every effect;
not to seek for indications of the hidden mind of the gods, by turning over, with futile research, the verses of Etruria,l superstitiously observing whence the fleeting fire has come, or to which quarter it has turned itself;
how it has penetrated through walled apartments, and how, having exer­ cised its power, it has extricated itself from them;
or what injury the stroke of a bolt from heaven can inflict.
But if Jupiter, and the other gods, shake the shining re­ gions of heaven with terrific thunder, and hurl the lightning whithersoever each has thought fit, why do they not take special care that those, who are guilty of reckless and detest­ able wickedness,2 may, being struck, inhale the flames of light­ ning into their pierced breasts, as a bitter warning to mortals?
And why rather is he, who is conscious to himself of no one disgraceful act, involved and overwhelmed, innocent as he is, with flames, and carried off suddenly with a whirlwind and fire from heaven ?
Why, also, if the gods hurl thunderbolts at men, do they ever seek solitary places, and labour in vain?
Or do they then exercise their arms, and strengthen their elbows?
3
And why, it may be asked, do they suffer the weapon of father Ju­ piter to be blunted against the earth ?
Or why does he him­ self suffer it, and not save it for his enemies ?
Furthermore, why does Jupiter never hurl his bolts over the earth, and scatter abroad thunder, from a clear sky?
Does he wait till storms threaten, and, when the clouds have spread over the heaven, come down into their vortex,1 that he may hence aim the strokes of his weapon from a nearer point?
For what reason, moreover, does he hurl his bolts into the sea?
Of what does he accuse the waves, and the watery flood, and the liquid plains ?
Besides, if he wishes us to guard against the blow of the thunder-bolt, why does he hesitate to contrive means that we may see it when it is hurled ?
But if he desires to overwhelm us with his lightning unawares, why does he thunder in the quarter from which he aims, so that we may avoid it ?
Why does he first excite darkness, and noises, and murmurings in the air?
And how can you believe that he hurls his bolts in various directions at the same time ?2
Or would you venture to say it never occurs that many strokes take effect at the same time ?
But it has often occurred, and must often occur, that as, in a storm, rains and showers fall on many places at once, so many thunder-strokes are discharged on the earth at the same mo­ ment.
Moreover, why does he shatter the sacred temples3 of the other gods, and his own stately abodes, with his destructive lightning ?
And why does he break in pieces the well-wrought statues of the divinities, and rob his own images of honour by violent disfigurement ?
And why does he generally aim at high places ?
at which it is evident that he does aim, inasmuch as we see most traces of his fire, and see them more distinctly, upon the loftiest mountains.
Furthermore, it is easy to understand from these observa­ tions, how those phænomena, which the Greeks from their na­ ture have called Πρηστη̃ρες,4 sent down from above, descend into the sea.
For it sometimes happens that they drop, like a column let down, from the sky into the ocean ;
around which column the waters boil, being excited by violent blasts of wind;
and whatever vessels are then caught in that vortex, are tossed about, and incur the greatest danger.
This occurs, when (as is at times the case) the impetuous force of the wind is not able to burst a cloud of which it has taken possession, but bears it down, so that it becomes, by degrees, like a pillar reaching from the heaven into the sea;
as if something were thrust down from above with a hand, and the force of an arm, and stretched into the waters.
Hence, when the fury of the wind has burst the cloud, it rushes forth into the sea, and ex­ cites an extraordinary agitation among the waves.
For the blast descends as a rolling whirlwind, and brings down with it the cloud, which is of a yielding substance, and not easy to be disruptured;
and when it has once thrust the heavy body of the cloud into the water of the ocean, it suddenly plunges itself wholly into the waves, and disturbs all the sea with a mighty noise, forcing it to boil with agitation.
It happens also, at times, that a vortex of wind1 involves itself in clouds, gathering up cloudy atoms from the air, and imitates as it were a PRESTER sent down from heaven.
When this vortex has descended to the earth, and has burst, it vomits forth, and tempests abroad,2 the impetuous fury of a whirl­ wind.
But such a vortex, because it is formed but seldom, and because the hills must obstruct its progress on the land, appears more commonly in the wide prospect and open atmo­ sphere over the sea.
Clouds are formed, when many atoms of a rough and hooked nature, flying in the higher region of the heaven above us, have suddenly come together and combined;
atoms which, though attached only in a slight degree, may yet be held united in a body.
These first cause small clouds to gather;
those small clouds then unite1 and are combined with one another, and, as they join, swell and are carried along by the winds with such violence, that at length a raging tempest arises.
2
It occurs, too, that the nearer to any part of the sky the elevated summits of hills are, so much the more constantly do they smoke, as it were, with the thick mist of a yellow cloud ;
3 because, when the clouds first gather, and before the eye can discern their thin substance, the winds, carrying them off, col­ lect them on the highest tops of the hills.
Here at last it happens, that, when a larger collection is formed, one dense and solid cloud seems both to show itself and to rise at the same time from the summit of the hills into the clear sky.
For the nature of the ground itself, and our own perceptions as we climb high mountains, demonstrate that breezy emi­ nences 4 are open to the ascent of exhalations.
Besides, that nature raises many atoms of vapour from the whole surface of the ocean, garments suspended upon the shore testify ;
inasmuch as they contract and retain moisture.
5
To augment the clouds, therefore, many atoms seem likely to arise from the motion of the salt water;
for the nature and action of all waters is similar.
Moreover, we observe mists and vapours arise from all rivers, and from the earth itself also, which, exhaled from it like a breath, are in the same manner carried upwards, and cover the sky with obscurity, and, uniting together by de­ grees, form clouds high in the air.
For the influence1 of the starry heaven above, too, keeps down the vapours, and, con­ densing them, weaves the blue sky over, as it were, with clouds.
It is possible, likewise, that to this assemblage of clouds2 may come seminal-atoms from without the heaven, which may assist to form mists and flying storms.
For I have shown that the number of primordial-atoms is countless, and that the extent of the depth of space is infinite;
3 and I have demon­ strated, too, with how great celerity seminal-particles fly, and how instantaneously they have power to pass through an in­ expressible distanced
It is not, therefore, wonderful if storms and darkness, diffused from above,5 cover, in a short time, such vast mountains, as well as the whole sea and land;
since on every side, exits and entrances are allowed to the elemen­ tal atoms, through all the passages of the air, and, as it were, through all the breathing-places of the vast universe around.
Attend now, and I will explain how rain6 collects in the clouds above, and how the showers are precipitated and de- scend upon the earth.
In the first place I shall observer that many atoms of moisture arise, together with the clouds them­ selves,2 from all things on the earth, and that both these sub­ stances, the clouds and the water which is contained in the clouds, increase together, in the same manner as our body grows together with the blood that is in it, and as sweat and other moisture, which are diffused throughout the limbs, are augmented together with them.
The clouds, too, when the wind drives them over the wide sea, frequently attract much mois­ ture from the salt water, like fleeces of wool suspended in the air.
In like manner moisture is raised from all rivers into the clouds;
where, when numerous particles of water have in many ways collected, and have been augmented from every quarter, the swollen clouds strive for two reasons to discharge themselves;
for the force of the wind presses them ;
and the mass of clouds itself, when a greater body than ordinary has united, urges and weighs them down from above, and makes the rain flow forth upon the earth.
Moreover, when the clouds are rarefied by the wind, or when they are dissolved by the influence of the sun's heat from above, they forthwith discharge rain;
their moisture distilling as wax,3 thoroughly melted, drops over a strong fire.
But violent rain takes place, when the clouds are vehe­ mently urged by both forces;
being densely heaped upon one another, and pressed by the impetuosity of the wind.
And rains are accustomed to last long, and to continue for a considerable period, when many particles of moisture flow together,4 and when there are clouds on clouds5 heaped one over another, pouring down water from above, and from every part around;
and when the whole earth, fuming with va­ pour, sends back moisture into the air.
Then, when the sun, in the midst of a dark storm, and when the rain descends opposite to him, has shone upon the shower with his rays, the hues of the rainbow appear upon the black clouds.
Other matters, which gather above us, and are produced above uUS, and all bodies (all I say, without exception)1 which collect in the clouds, as snow, wind, hail, and cold frost, as well as the strong power of ice, the great hardener of the waters, and the restraint which every where delays the eager rivers;
all these, though numerous, it is yet very easy to un­ derstand, and to comprehend how they are produced, and from what cause they arise, when you have thoroughly learned what virtues and qualities belong to the atoms which constitute their substance.
Give me now your attention further, and learn what is the cause of earthquakes.
2
And first, suppose the earth to be below, as it is above, filled in every part with airy caverns, and containing also, in its bosom, many lakes and many pools, as well as stones and fissured rocks;
while you must likewise suppose that it rolls along forcibly, beneath the surface of the soil, many hidden rivers, floods, and submerged rocks;
for nature herself requires that the earth be similar to itself throughout.
These points, then, being laid down and admitted, the earth quakes on the surface, when it is shaken by great falls of sub­ stances beneath, as when age brings down vast caverns;
for then whole mountains sink, and, from the violent shock, trem­ bUngs spread far and wide in a moment;
an effect which we may naturally imagine;
since whole houses totter by the side of a road, when shaken with waggons, though of no great weight;
nor are edifices less agitated3 when the stout drivers of chariots hurry dong the street the iron rounds of the wheels.
It happens, also, that when a large mass of earth1 rolls down, from the effects of time, into a wide and deep pool of water, the water is agitated, and the earth, too, trembles with the concussion of the flood;
as a vessel of liquid cannot stand still upon the ground, unless the liquid, after being shaken, has ceased to sway with a rocking motion within it.
Moreover, when wind, collected in the hollow places under the earth, bears strongly from one quarter, and, struggling with vast power, crowds into the deep caverns, the earth, to­ wards the part where the force of the blast directs itself, inclines and gives way;
and then the buildings which are erected upon the earth's surface,2 sloping and being driven from the perpendicular, lean in the same direction, and so much the more as they respectively rise higher into the air;
while the beams, being stretched, stand out, as ready to start from their places.
And do men hesitate to believe that a time of ruin and destruction awaits the whole fabric of the world, when they see so vast a mass of the earth give way ?
Whereas, even now, unless the winds were to remit their fury, no power could save all things,3 or could hinder them from going to destruction;
but, because they relax and struggle by turns, and, as if collecting their force, return to the charge, and then retreat as if repulsed;
the earth, on this account, oftener threatens ruin than actually suffers it;
1 for it inclines and starts back, as it were, only for a time, and then, making an effort with its whole weight, recovers its station.
2
From this cause, accordingly, all our houses tremble and reel;
the highest more than the middling, the middling more than the lowest, the lowest scarcely at all.
3
There is also this cause of great quaking of the earth to be mentioned.
When wind, and any vast quantity of air, collected either without or within the earth, has suddenly thrown itself into hollow places under the ground, it there rages, at first,4 with violent fury, among the vast caverns, and rolls and urges itself along;
but at length, when its force is roused and ex cited, it bursts forth abroad, and, cleaving the deep soil, forms a huge yawning chasm;
as happened in Syrian Sidon,5 and was seen at Ægium in the Peloponnesus;
1 which cities, such an eruption of air, and an earthquake produced at the same time, overthrew and destroyed.
Many other cities, also, by reason of violent earthquakes, have sunk down to the ground ;
and many cities, with their inhabitants, have been over­ whelmed in the sea.
But if the force of the air, and violent fury of the wind, do not burst through the soil, they yet spread, like shuddering blasts, through the numerous open­ ings under ground, and thus cause a tremour on the surface;
as cold, when it penetrates into our limbs, shakes them, and compels them to tremble and quiver against our will.
Men, therefore, in cities, are appalled, on such occasions, with dou­ ble terror;
for they dread the buildings above them;
and are afraid, at the same time, lest the earth should suddenly break up3 the depths below, and lest, being disruptured and dis­ ordered, it should open wide its jaws, and prepare to fill them with its own ruins.
Though men, therefore, think that the heavens and the earth will be imperishable, and are intrusted to eternal safety,4 yet, at times, the present influence of danger causes in some degree the sensation of fear;
a fear lest the earth, suddenly withdrawn from beneath their feet, should sink down into a gulf;
and lest the SUM OF THINGS, utterly overthrown, should follow it, and only a confused wreck of the world remain.
I must now proceed to give a reason why the sea knows no augmentation.
1
In the first place, men wonder that nature does not necessarily enlarge the ocean, into which there is so great a conflux of waters, and into which the-rivers run from all quarters.
But add to the rivers, if you please, the wan­ dering showers and flying storms, which scatter and discharge themselves over all the sea and the earth;
add, if you please, the sources of the rivers;
yet all these, compared with the vastness of the sea, are but as one drop of water fcr the aug­ mentation of the whole.
It is no wonder, therefore, that the mighty ocean is not increased.
Besides, the sun, by the influence of his heat, draws a large portion away from it.
For we observe how the sun dries, with his burning rays, garments that are drenched with mois­ ture.
But the ocean, we see, is large, and widely extended beneath his beams;
and although, therefore, the sun may ex­ hale but a small portion of moisture from each spot on the seal it will yet deduct a large quantity from its waters through­ out so great an extent of surface.
Moreover the winds,-the winds, I say, which sweep the ocean,-may carry off a considerable portion of its liquid;
for we often see the roads, after being drenched with rain, dried in a single night, and a crust of mud, which before was soft, hardened and congealed upon them.
The clouds, too, I have before shown, take up a large quan­ tity of moisture, which is attracted by them from the vast surface of the ocean;
and which they sprinkle, in various parts, over the whole round of the earth, at times when rain falls on the ground, and when he winds drive the clouds athwart the sky.
Lastly, since the earth is of a porous consistence, and is in contact with the sea, encompassing the shores of the deep on all sides, the water, as it flows from the earth into the sea, must likewise pass, reciprocally, from the salt sea into the earth;
for the salt is strained off, and the pure substance of the water flows back into the ground, and collects all together at the sources of rivers;
from whence it returns, in fresh streams, over the earth, wherever a passage, once cut, has conveyed the flood in its liquid course.
1
I shall now explain what is the cause that fires at times burst forth, with such tempestuous fury, from the jaws of Mount Ætna.
2
For it was not from any divine origin of calamity,3 that a storm of fire, rising and raging over the fields of the Sicilians, attracted to itself the attention of the neighbouring nations, when, observing all the regions of heaven covered with smoke, and gleaming with flames, they felt their breasts filled with awful anxiety, dreading what new catastrophe nature might design to produce.
In contemplating such subjects as these, you must stretch your view widely and deeply, and look far abroad in all di­ rections, that you may remind yourself that the SUM OF THINGS is vast, and reflect how very small, how infinitely small a part of the whole universe, is this one heaven;
not even so con­ siderable a part as one man is of the whole earth.
This point if you fully consider, and fully understand, when it is fairly presented to your mind, you may forbear to wonder at many things which now excite your admiration.
For, in respect to our own bodies, which of us is surprised if any of his neighbours has contracted a fever, that spreads through his frame with a burning heat, or has felt any other painful disease in his limbs ?
Since the foot often swells on a sudden;
a sharp pang frequently seizes the teeth, or darts through the eyes;
erysipelas arises, and, creeping through the frame, burns whatever part it has attacked, and spreads itself over the limbs.
Nor is it strange that such maladies should occur;
for there are atoms ready to produce many effects;
and this earth and air contain seeds enough of noxious dis­ ease, from which an abundance of infinite disorder may have its growth.
Thus, too, we must suppose that, as to our own bodies, so to the whole heaven and earth, are plentifully sup­ plied all kinds of atoms from the immensity of matter, by the effects of which the earth, being suddenly moved, may quake with agitation, while a rapid hurricane may rush over sea and land, the fire of Ætna may swell forth, and the heaven be in a blaze;
for even this happens, even the celestial regions glow with heat.
Thus, too, storms of rain arise with a greater combination-of-force, when particles of moisture have in like manner chanced to unite themselves.
“But the raging fire of Ætna,” you will say, " is extraordi­ narily great."
Doubtless, I answer;
and a river, which has been seen by any person, appears extraordinarily great to him who has never before seen a greater;
and a man or a tree possibly appears large to the eyes of some animals;
and every one imagines every thing of every sort, which is the greatest that he has seen, to be extremely large;
although all things that he beholds, together with the heaven and the earth and the ocean, are as nothing in comparison with the ENTIRE SUM OF THE ENTIRE WHOLE.
1
I will now, however, explain by what causes the fire ot AEtna, when suddenly excited, bursts forth from its vast fur­ naces.
In the first place, the fabric of the mountain is hollow underneath, supported, for the most part, by arches of flint- stone.
In all the caverns, moreover, is wind and air, for air, when it is moved by any agitating impulse, becomes wind.
When this air, then, has grown hot, and has heated all the rocks and earth round about, as far as it reaches, and elicited from them fire raging with violent flames, it mounts up, and thus expels the blaze straight from the jaws of the mountain, high into the air, and spreads it far abroad, and scatters the embers to a great distance, and rolls forth smoke heavy with thick darkness, while it darts out, at the same time, rocks of a wonderful weight.
You cannot, therefore, doubt, but that it is the violent force of air which produces these effects.
Besides, the sea, for a considerable distance, alternately breaks its waves, and again retracts its tide, at the base of that mountain.
From this sea caverns extend under ground as far as the ascending jaws of the mountain;
by these caverns you must admit (for fact absolutely compels you) that blasts of wind enter1 and penetrate from the open sea, and thus exalt the flame, and cast up rocks, and raise clouds of sand.
For on the summit of the mountain are craters, as the Greek call them, but which we call jaws and mouths.
There are some phaenomena, too, for which it is not suf­ ficient to assign merely one cause, but it is requisite to enumerate many:
of which, however, one only can be the true cause.
As if, for example, you should see the dead body of a man lying on the ground at a distance, you naturally run over all the probable causes of his death,2 that the one cause of it may be sure to be mentioned.
For neither, perhaps, can you prove that he died by the sword, nor of the effects of cold, nor by disease, nor by poison;
but we know that it is something ot this destructive nature that has happened to him.
This same observation we may make in respect to many other things.
The Nile, the river of all Egypt,1 is the only one of all streams in the world that swells towards summer, and inun­ dates the fields.
This river waters Egypt, from time to time, during the middle of the hot season;
and this happens, possi­ bly,2 because the north winds, which are said to be Etesian winds,3 prevail at that time in the summer over against the mouth of the river, and, blowing up the stream, retard it;
and thus, forcing the flood up the channel, fill it, and compel the waters to stagnate.
For without doubt these breezes, which come from the cold stars of the north pole, advance against the stream.
The river flows from the warm countries, taking its rise from the extreme south, and from the regions of noon- day,1 amidst the races of mankind blackened with scorching heat.
2
It is possible, also, that a great collection of sand3 (at times when the sea, excited by the wind, drives the sand within the bed of the river) may cause obstruction4 at the mouth of the stream to the waters coming towards it.
By this means it may happen that the outlet of the river may be less free, and that the current of the water, likewise, may be rendered less impetuous.
It is also possible, perhaps, that rain may fall more abund­ antly near its source, at the very time when the Etesian winds from the north drive all the clouds into those parts.
For when the clouds, impelled towards the regions of the south,5 have collected there in a body, they are at last pressed and driven against the lofty mountains, and compelled by the force of the wind to discharge their waters.
Perhaps, too, it may have its increase entirely from the high hills of the Ethiopians, at the time when the sun, shining on all parts of them, forces the white snow, with his dissolving rays, to descend in aflood upon the plains.
Give me now your attention, and I will show with what nature and qualities the regions and lakes, which are called Avernian,1 are distinguished.
In the first place, as to the circumstance that they are named Avernian, that name has been given them from their peculiar property, inasmuch as they are destructive to all kinds of birds;
and because, when any of the feathered tribe have, in their flight, come over against those parts,2 forgetful of their steerage, they relax the sails of their pinions, and, sinking down with powerless neck, fall headlong on the ground, if, perchance, the nature of the parts beneath allow them to fall thus, or into the water, if a lake of Avernus happen to be stretched under them.
Such a spot is near Cumæ, where the hills smoke from being charged with vivid sulphur, and abounding with hot springs.
There is also a place within the walls of Athens, on the very summit of the hill, close by the temple of bountiful Tritonian Pallas, to which the hoarse crows never direct their flight;
not even when the altars smoke with offerings.
So carefully do they avoid, not the violent wrath of Pallas on account of watchfulness,3 as the poets of the Greeks have sung, but the fumes of the sulphur;
for the nature of the place produces this effect of itself.
There is also reported to be a place in Syria, plainly to be seen,4 to which as soon as four-footed animals have directed their steps, the very nature of it causes them to fall heavily on the earth, as if they were suddenly made a sacrifice to the infernal deities.
But all these things are effected by the operation of nature;
and the origin of them, and from what causes they arise, is apparent.
So that the gate of Tartarus must not be thought to be situate in these regions, nor, moreover,1 must we imagine that the infernal deities can possibly draw souls down from hence into the coasts of Acheron, as swift stags,2 with the breath of their nostrils, are often supposed to draw the crawl­ ing tribes of serpents from their hiding-places.
But observe, I pray you, how far all this is at variance with just reasoning;
for I now proceed to give you a full explanation concerning this very subject.
In the first place, I assert this, (which I have also fre quently asserted before,3) that there are in the earth all kinds of forms of the atoms of things ;
of which there are many that are wholesome for food, and many that may bring on disease and hasten death.
We have also previously shown4 that for different animals, with regard to the sustenance of life, some substances are better adapted than others, on account of their dissimilar natures, and opposite constitution one to the other, and the primary figures of their seminal-particles.
Many noxious atoms pass through the ears;
many that are offensive and harsh to the sense penetrate through the nostrils;
nor are there few only which are to be avoided by the touch, or shunned by the sight, or which are bitter to the taste.
You may notice, too, how many things are of a violently pernicious influence on mankind, both disagreeable and deadly.
To certain trees, we may first observe, has been assigned a poisonous shade so that they often cause pains in the head, if any one lies stretched on the grass beneath them.
There is likewise on the high mountains of Helicon a tree,1 which has been known to kill a man by the malignant odour of its blossom.
All these destructive substances, you will un­ derstand, spring from the ground, because the earth contains many seeds of many things mingled in many ways, and dis­ tributes them separately to different productions.
And when a night taper, just extinguished,2 strikes a per­ son's nostrils with a pungent odour, it takes away his senses, so that he falls down on the very spot;
as when that disease takes effect3 which is accustomed to stretch men at full length.
And a woman, overcome with the strong scent of castor, if she has smelt it at the time at which she discharges her menses, falls backward, and her elegant work drops from her tender hands.
And many other things relax the organs, causing them to languish throughout the body, and disturb the soul in its seat within.
Besides, if, with a stomach too full, you even stay long in a warm bath, or are drenched in a laver of tepid watery how easily may it often happen that you may fall down fainting in the middle of it!
And how easily does the oppressive vapour and scent of charcoal find an entrance into the brain, unless we have first taken a draught of water!
1
But when it has penetrated2 through all the well-warmed apartments of a house, the odour of wine then falls like a deadly blow upon the nerves.
Do you not observe also that sulphur is produced in the earth itself, and that bitumen, with its offensive smell, forms concretions in it?
When, moreover, men seek for veins of silver and gold, searching the hidden depths of the earth with iron instruments, how strong an odour does the mine exhale from beneath!
Or have you not learned how much poison is in the earth for gold mines to exhale?
2
What sort of looks and com­ plexions do they produce in the men who work in them ?
Do you not remark, or hear from others, in how short a time they are wont to waste away, and how length of life is neces­ sarily withheld from those whom superior power confines in such an employment ?
The earth, evidently, steams forth all these vapours, and breathes them out into the regions of the air, which are open and ready to receive them.
So, likewise, the regions of Avernus must send up from beneath a vapour destructive to birds;
a vapour which ascends from the earth into the air, in such abundance as to poison the body of the atmosphere to a certain extent.
So that, as soon as a bird has been borne thither on its wings, it is there stopped, being so violently affected by the invisible poison, that it drops down over against the spot where the exhalation raises itself.
And when the bird has fallen there,3 this same force of the exhalation takes away the remains of life from all its members.
For at first it only excites, as it were, a certain giddiness in the birds, but afterwards, when they have fallen from on high on the very sources of the poison, it comes to pass that they must there yield up even their life, because a vast quantity of the poisonous-exhalation surrounds them.
It happens also, at times, that this vapour and exhalation of Avernus disperses the air which intervenes between the birds and the earth, so that that portion of the atmosphere is left, from this cause, almost empty.
And when the birds, in their flight, have come over against this part, the effort of their wings immediately halts and grows ineffectual, and every struggle of their pinions, on either side, is unsupported.
Thus, when they are unable to flap their wings, or to rest upon them, nature, you will understand, compels them to de­ scend to the earth by their own weight, and accordingly, sink­ ing down through the part which is almost a vacuum, they disperse abroad their lives through every pore of the body.
Water in wells,' moreover, grows cooler in summer, and for this reason, that the earth is then rarified by the heat, and emits rapidly into the air any atoms of warmth which it may happen to contain.
The more, accordingly, the earth is ex­ hausted of its heat, the cooler, also, does the water become which is concealed under-ground.
And on the contrary, too, when the earth is contracted, and condensed, and congealed, as it were, with cold, it happens that, as it contracts, it dis­ charges into the wells whatever heat it contains.
Near the temple of Jupiter Ammon, there is said to be a fountain which is cold in the day and warm in the night.
At the peculiarity of this fountain men greatly wonder, and imagine that the earth is heated, in its turn,3 by the power of the sun from beneath, during the time when night has covered the earth with its awful darkness;
a supposition which is too much opposed to just reasoning.
For since the sun, striking on the uncovered body of water at noon-day, when the rays from above are possessed of such violent heat, cannot make it warm even on the surface, how can this same sun act upon the water, and infuse into it his quickening heat, from beneath the earth, which is of so dense and solid a consist­ ence?
Especially when he can scarcely make his warmth, by means of his glowing rays, penetrate through the walls of houses.
What, then, is the cause ?
It is evidently this:
that certain ground, less dense than the rest of the ground, encircles this fountain;
and that there are many atoms of heat near the body of water.
Hence, when night covers the earth with its dewy shade, the ground underneath immediately becomes cold and contracts.
By this process it happens that the soil, as if it were compressed with the hand, discharges into the fountain whatever atoms of heat it contains, which make the water warm to the touch, 1 as well as the steam of it.
After­ wards, when the sun, with his morning rays, has relaxed and rarefied the earth, (as his active heat mingles with it,) the atoms -of heat return again into their former places, and all the warmth of the water passes into the ground.
From this cause the fountain becomes cold in the day-time.
Besides, the water is acted upon by the rays of the sun as the day comes on,2 and is rarefied by the tremulous heat of his beams.
It accordingly happens, that whatever particles of heat it contains, it disperses;
as water often dispels the cold which it contains, and dissolves its ice, and relaxes its fetters.
There is also a cold spring at Dodona,3 over which when tow is placed, it frequently, catching fire at once, throws out flame;
and in like manner a torch, lighted at its waters, casts a radiance, wherever it swims or is impelled by the winds over the surface;
the cause evidently being, that there are in the water many atoms of heat;
and particles of warmth must also arise from the earth itself over all the bottom of the fountain, and be exharod and pass forth, at the same time, into the air;
yet these particles must not be so vivid as that the spring can be rendered hot by them.
Besides, some powerful influence excites those atoms of heat, when dispersed abroad, to burst suddenly upwards through the water, and to combine on the surface;
as, in the sea around Arados,l there is a spring of fresh water which bubbles up through it, and puts aside the salt waves around it.
And in many other places the sea affords a seasonable relief to thirsty mariners, inasmuch as it casts up fresh water among the salt.
Thus, too, those atoms of heat may burst up through that foun­ tain of which we have spoken, and diffuse themselves abroad among the tow;
which atoms, when they combine together, or adhere to the substance of the tow or torch, easily take fire at once;
because tow and torches contain likewise many particles of heat, which may unite with those in the water to produce flame.
Do you not observe, also, that when you hold the wick of a lamp?
recently extinguished, to a night taper, it takes fire before it touches the flame ?
And have you not noticed a torch catch fire in like manner?
Many 'other substances, too, affected by the mere heat, begin to burn at a distance from a fire, before its flame closely involves them.
3
Such, therefore, we must conceive to be the case with respect to that fountain.
In the next place, I shall proceed to show by what law of nature it happens that the stone, which the Greeks call a magneto from the name of the region that produced it, (for it was first found in the country of the Magnetes,) has the power to attract iron.
At this stone men look with astonishment, for it often ex­ hibits a chain of little rings suspended from it.
Since you may at times see five or more, hanging in a straight line, oscillate in a gentle breeze, whilst one depends from another, attached to it underneath;
and whilst they feel from each other the influence and attraction of the stone;
so thoroughly does its force pervade the whole succession of rings.
In matters of this kind, you must establish many points be­ fore you can state the principle of the thing itself;
and I must, accordingly, approach the subject by a long circuit of introductory remarks;
on which account I entreat your atten­ tive ear andfavourable regard.
In the first place, from all bodies,l whatsoever we behold, there must necessarily flow, and be emitted and dispersed, certain substances which strike the eye and excite vision;
odours, too, are perpetually flying off from some bodies;
as cold is also diffused from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the billows of the ocean, which consumes walls near the shore;
nor do various voices cease to flit through the air;
moreover the moisture, so to speak, of a salt taste comes often into the mouth when we are walking near the sea;
and when we look at diluted wormwood being mixed, a bitterness affects Cur palate.
So evident is it that a certain substance is carried off perpetually from all bodies, and is dis­ persed in all parts round about;
nor is there any delay or rest allowed to the efflux ;
since we constantly perceive it with our senses, and may see all objects at all times, and smell them, and hear them sound.
Here I shall observe again2 that which is set forth in the first part of my poem, namely, of how porous a consistence bodies are.
For though to understand this is of importance to many subjects, it is especially necessary to establish, with regard to the very matter immediately under our notice (concerning which I am proceeding to speak,) that there is nothing in the whole of things before us I but body intermingled with vacuity.
It is apparent, first of all, that in caverns2 the overhanging rocks exude moisture, and distil running drops.
From the whole of our own bodies, also, perspiration trickles;
our beard springs forth from them, and hairs arise over all our limbs and members;
the food which we take is distributed through all our veins, and swells and nourishes the extreme parts of the body, and even the very nails;
we feel cold, too, and vivid heat, penetrate through brass;
we feel them like­ wise pass through gold and silver, when we are holding full cups.
3
Moreover voices fly through the stone walls of houses;
odours, and cold, pervade them;
as well as the heat of fire, which has power to penetrate even the substance of iron, as is felt where the corslet confines the circuit of the neck.
4
The infection of disease likewise penetrates walls, as it enters into houses from without.
Philosophers too, with reason, send far back again5 into the depths of heaven and earth, the tempest which has burst forth from the earth and the heaven ;
since they rightly consider that there is no combination of matter, ethereal or terrestrial, which is not of a consistence far-from-impenetrable to other atoms.
1
To this is to be added, that all atoms, which are discharged from bodies, are not possessed of the same power to affect the senses, nor are they all alike adapted to all substances.
The sun, we may first observe, extracts the moisture from the earth, and renders it dry;
while it melts ice, and forces the snows, piled on the high mountains, to dissolve in the heat of its rays.
Wax, too, placed in the warmth of the sun, be­ comes liquid.
Fire, moreover, melts brass, and dissolves gold, but contracts and draws together the hides and flesh of animals.
Water, also, hardens iron when fresh from the fire, but softens hides and flesh when hardened with heat.
The wild olive tree, than which there is nothing that grows more bitter to the taste of man, delights the bearded goats as if it were flavoured with nectar and ambrosia.
Swine, be­ sides, shrink from ointment of amaracus,2 and dread every kind of perfume ;
for that which seems, at times, to restore us, as it were, to life, is to bristly boars strong poison.
But mud, on the contrary, which is to us most repulsive filth, seems clean and attractive to swine, so that they roll themselves over and over in it without being tired.
There is this, likewise, which remains to be noticed, and which seems necessary to be stated before I proceed to speak of the exact subject before us.
Since in various bodies are situated many pores, these pores must be distinguished by na­ tures differing from one another, and have respectively their own forms and shapes.
3
For there are various senses in ani­ mals, of which each perceives for itself its own peculiar object;
since we observe that by one sense sounds penetrate into us, by another taste from the juices of food, by another the smell of perfume.
Besides, one thing seems to pass through stone, another through wood, another through gold.
One substance seems to penetrate silver, and another glass ;
for through the latter images seem to pass, and through the former heat.
One thing, too, seems to penetrate through the same passages quicker than another.
This difference, you may be certain, the nature of the passages obliges to exist;
since it evidently varies (as we showed a little above) according to the different consistence and texture of bodies.
For which reason, since all these points are established and laid down, and every thing prepared and made ready for us, the principle of the magnet will hence, moreover,1 be easily shown, and the whole cause, which attracts the substance of the iron, will be made manifest.
In the first place, many atoms, or effluvia, must necessarily fly off from the stone, which, by their impact, disperse the air that is situate betwixt the stone and the iron.
When this space is emptied, and a large void is made between them, atoms of the iron, immediately darting forward, rush in a body into the vacuum ;
and the whole ring of necessity follows, and passes onward with its whole body.
For no substance coheres and combines more closely,-having its primary-elements in­ timately involved,-than the cold and rough consistence of stout iron.
2
It is therefore the less wonderful, if (as is stated) certain of its atoms,3 starting forth in a body from the iron itself cannot rush into the void without the whole ring following;
which it does, and continues to move until it has reached the stone itself, and has become fixed to it by secret attachment.
The same process takes place on all sides;
and wherever an empty space is formed, whether at the side qf the iron or above it, the nearest atoms tend immediately into the void.
For they are impelled by impacts from other surround­ ing atoms;
nor can they, of themselves, rise upwards, or pass away from the magnet, into the air.
To this is to be added another reason why this motion of the atoms may still more certainly take place;
namely, that as soon as the air before the ring has become thinner, and the space between it and the magnet more vacant and open, it immediately happens that the air which is situate at the back of the ring, carries it forward, as it were, and impels it from behind.
For the air surrounding all bodies continually strikes upon them;
but the air that surrounds the iron drives it for­ ward at such times as it approaches the magnet, because the space on one side is empty, and receives it into itself.
And this air too, of which I am speaking, subtilly conveying itself, through the numerous pores of the iron, into its small recesses, thrusts and pushes it forward.
This substance of the iron, accordingly, is helped forward by this assistance and impulse, as ships and their sails are driven onwards by the wind.
All bodies, moreover, must contain air in their substance, since their consistence is more or less porous, and air sur­ rounds and is in contact with every thing.
This air, then, which is concealed within the iron, is continually agitated with a restless motion, and thus, doubtless, strikes upon the ring, and moves it, as you may conceive, internally;
and the whole air, within and without, tends in the same direction in which it has once started, and where it has found a vacuum to assist its efforts.
It happens, too, at times, that the substance of the iron re­ cedes I from this stone, as if accustomed to start back from it, and to follow it, by turns.
Thus have I seen iron rings of Samothrace,1 as well as filings of iron, lying in brazen basins, thrown into agitation, and start up, when the magnet was applied anderneath;
so that it seems desirous to flee away from the load-stone, when the brass is interposed;
for it is by the intervention of the brass that so great an aversion is produced;
since, as is evi­ dent, when the effluvia of the brass have pre-occupied and filled up the open pores of the iron, the effluvia of the stone follow, and find all parts of the iron full;
and have no way to pass through, as they would have had before.
They are therefore obliged to strike against the substance of the iron, and to drive it upward, with their own stream;
by which means the magnet repels from itself, and drives away through the brass, that metal, which, without the interference of the brass, it most frequently attracts.
But do not wonder, in the consideration of these subjects, that the effluvia from this stone cannot also repel other sub­ stances.
For some substances remain unmoved as being sus­ tained by their own weight;
of which sort is gold;
and others cannot be repulsed, because they are of a porous consistence, so that the effluvia pass through them unobstructed ;
of which kind wood appears to be.
The substance of iron, however, is placed between these two, so that, when it has admitted certain atoms of the brass, it is then possible for the stream of particles from the magnet to impel it.
Nor are these mutual affinities of the magnet and iron so unlike the affections of all other substances, but that many instances of the kind occur to me;
instances of bodies which I could mention as remarkably adapted to each other.
In the first place, you see stones cemented only with lime.
Wood is joined together with glue, prepared from certain parts of oxen ;
and with such strength, that the veins of boards will open in cracks,2 sooner than the seams of ox-glue will relax their fastenings.
The juice of the vine is willing to mingle with spring water, while heavy pitch, and light olive oil, refuse to unite with it.
The purple colour of the murex so blends in one body with wool, that it can never be extracted from it;
not even if you should strive to restore the wool to its whiteness with all the waves of the sea;
not even if the whole ocean, with all its floods, should be disposed to cleanse it.
Moreover, one substance only couples gold with gold;
1 and brass is united with brass only by pewter.
2How many other facts of this nature is it possible to pro­ duce !
But to what purpose would it be ?
Neither are such long digressions necessary for you, nor does it become me to bestow so much labour on this one subject;
but it is proper for me to comprise many matters in brief space and in few words.
To conclude, then, respecting the magnet.
Between those bodies, whose textures so mutually correspond,3 that the cavi ties of this answer to the prominences of that, and the cavities of that to the prominences of this, the best union is evidently formed.
4
It is possible, also, we may observe, that some bodies may be held united as if with rings and hooks ;
5 a mode of union which seems to take place, rather than any other, be­ tween the loadstone and iron.
I shall now explain what is the nature and origin of dis­ eases,1 and how a morbid infection of the air, suddenly arising, may spread deadly destruction among the race of mankind and the tribes of inferior animals.
In the first place, I have already shown2 that there are in many substances atoms which tend to preserve our life;
and, on the other hand, many must ne­ cessarily fly abroad which are productive of disease and death;
and when these have by chance combined, and disordered the air, the air, when in this state, consequently becomes unwhole­ some.
And all this prevalence and pestilentialness of diseases arise either from without the earth, (as clouds and mists gather in the heaven above us,) or spring, as frequently happens, from the earth itself, when, drenched with immoderate and un­ timely rains, and acted upon by fierce rays of the sun, it has contracted a kind of putrescence.
Do you not observe, also, how those who visit any place far from their country and their home, are affected by the change in the air and water ?
And this happens, because the substances in those elements greatly differ.
For how much must we suppose that the air of the Britons varies from that which is in Egypt, where the north pole of the world fails to show itself?
3
Or how much must we imagine that that which hangs over Pontus differs from that which stretches over Cadiz, and towards the races of men blackened by the parching heat of the sun?
4
These four kinds of air, which we observe to proceed from the four winds and four several quarters of the heaven, we know to be different one from another ;
and the complexion and looks of the men, also, appear to differ widely ;
and peculiar diseases seem to affect each individual nation.
There is the disease called leprosy,1 which has its rise on the river Nile, in the middle of Egypt, and in no other country.
In Attica the feet2 are affected with the gout;
and in the country of Achaia the eyes are afflicted with soreness.
Hence various regions are unfavourable to various parts and mem­ bers ;
and this effect the difference of the air produces.
When that air, therefore, which to us is strong poison, puts it­ self in motion, and an unwholesome atmosphere begins to spread, it creeps along, by degrees, like a mist or cloud, and disorders the whole heaven, wherever it advances, and compels it to alter its nature.
It happens, accordingly, that when this cor­ rupt air has at length joined our air, it infects it, and renders it like itself, and unsuitable for us.
This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other food of men and cattle.
Or even, as may be the case, the in­ fection remains suspended in the air itself;
3 and when, as we breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must neces­ sarily absorb those seeds of disease into our body.
By a similar process a pestilence often spreads among oxen;
and contagion among dull sheep.
Nor does it make any differ- ence, whether we go into climates that are unfavourable to us, and change the atmosphere around us ourselves, or whether nature, of her own accord, brings upon us corrupt air, or any other affection which we are not accustomed to experience, and which, at its first approach, may infect us with disease.
Such a cause of disease, and such deadly vapour in the atmosphere, formerly rendered the fields poisonous throughout the territories of Attica;
1 it both dispeopled the roads, and exhausted the city of its inhabitants.
For, having its rise in remote parts, proceeding from the coasts of Egypt, and having passed through a long tract of air, and over the liquid plains of the sea, it at length descended on the people of Pandion, and all were then consigned by troops to disease and death.
They first found the head burning with heat,3 and the eyes red with an extraordinary brilliancy shed over them.
The jaws, also, which looked black within, exuded blood;
ana the passage of the voice was clogged and obstructed1 with ulcers.
The tongue, the interpreter of the mind, was covered with drops of gore, and was enfeebled by the disease, slow in its motion, and rough to the touch.
Then, when the pestilential influence, descending through the jaws, had filled the chest and gathered in the suffering stomach2 of the patients, all the defences of life at once gave way.
The breath sent forth a fetid odour from the mouth, such as putrid carcasses, cast out upon the earth, emit.
The powers of the whole mind, and the whole body, grew languid, as if on the very threshold of death.
On these intolerable suffer­ ings was perpetually attendant an anxious distress of mind, and complaints mingled with meanings.
A retching,3 too frequently occurring both by night and by day, convulsed the nerves from time to time, and, contracting the limbs, rendered the sufferers powerless, exhausting those who were already wearied out with pain.
Yet you could not perceive the surface of the body of any one externally1 inflamed with any extraordinary degree of heat, but rather offering a sensation of gentle warmth to the hand.
At the same time, however, all the body looked red with ulcers, as it were, burning in it;
2 as it appears when the ery­ sipelas spreads over the limbs.
But the internal part of the patient was glowing with heat, that penetrated even into the bones;
a fire raged in the stomach, as in a furnace ;
so that you could have rendered no garment, however light and thin, of use to the person of any one ;
they constantly exposed their limbs, burning with the disease, to the wind and the cold;
and some threw themselves into cool rivers, precipitating their bodies naked into the waters.
Many, approaching the brink with open mouths, hurled themselves headlong down1 into the water in wells;
for a parching thirst, raging insatiably, and driving-them-to-plunge their bodies into the flood, made vast showers seem only as small drops.
Nor was there any intermission of the malady;
the bodies of men lay exhausted;
medicine spoke in low tones with a secret dread ;
2 so incessantly did the patients roll their eyes, which remained wide open, burning with disease, and un­ visited by sleep.
Many other signs of death at the same time showed themselves;
the mind was distracted with anguish and dread;
the brow was gloomy;
the look wild and fierce;
the ears disturbed and filled with noises;
the breathing was either fast, or thick, or drawn but seldom;
there was a moist dew of perspiration shining upon the neck;
the saliva was thin, scanty, and tinged with the colour of saffron;
it was also salt, and expelled with difficulty from the hoarse throat by coughing.
In the hand, the nerves contracted;
and the whole arm shook.
From the feet a coldness rose quickly, yet gradually,3 over the body;
the nostrils, towards the closing hour of life, were compressed;
the point of the nose was sharp;
the eyes were hollow ;
the temples sunk ;
the skin cold and hard;
a distortion overspreading the mouth;
the forehead tense and prominent;
and, not long after these appearances, the limbs lay stretched in rigid death;
and for the most part, when the eighth light of the sun shone, or, at farthest, at his ninth rising, they yielded up their life.
Of which sufferers, if any one for a time escaped death, (as was possible, either by reason of the foul ulcers breaking, or by means of a black discharge from the intestines,) yet con- sumption and destruction awaited him at last;
or, as was often the case, an excessive flux of corrupt blood, attended with violent pains in the head, issued from the obstructed nostrils;
and, by this outlet, the whole strength and substance of the loan passed away.
He, moreover, who had escaped this violent flux of foul blood, was not certain wholly to recover;
for still the disease was ready-to-pass into his nerves and joints, and into the very genial organs of the body.
And of those who suffered thus, some, fearing the gates of death, continued to live, though deprived by the steel of the virile part;
and some, though without hands and feet, and though they lost their eyes, yet persisted-to-remain in life;
so strong a dread of death had taken possession of them.
Upon some, too, came forgetfulness1 of all things, so that they knew not even themselves.
And though numerous corpses, heaped upon corpses, lay extended over the ground, yet the tribes of birds, and of wild beasts, either ran off to a distance, to avoid the repulsive stench, or, after having tasted the flesh, sickened with instant death.
But, indeed, during those days, scarcely any bird appeared in the sky;
nor did the destructive tribes of savage beasts leave the woods during the nights.
Most of them suffered from the disease, and died;
the faithful spirit of the dog,2 espe- cially, stretched along all the streets, unwillingly relinquished life;
the force of the disease, however, wrested the vital power from his limbs.
Funerals, unattended and solitary, were eagerly hurried over.
1 Nor was there any certain mode of cure common and efficientfor all.
For that which had secured to one the privi­ lege of breathing the vital air,2 and of beholding the regions of the sky, was mere poison to others, and hastened their death.
But that which, in these circumstances, was pre-eminently deplorable and wretched, was, that when any one found him­ self seized with the pestilence, he lay down, as if he were con­ demned3 to death, sunk in spirit, and with a despairing hearty thinking only of death, and gave up the ghost on the same spot on which he fell.
At no time, however, did the contagion of the insatiable disease cease to spread itself from one man to another, as a murrain is disseminated among woolly sheep and horned cattle.
And this circumstance, even above all others, heaped death upon death.
For on those, who shrunk from visiting their sickfriends, fatal neglect soon took vengeance, (as having been too fond of life and too apprehensive of death,) causing them to perish by a squalid and miserable end, deserted by their rela­ tives, and destitute of relief.
But those who had been ready to give assistance, fell into the malady from infection, and by reason of the duty which shame, and the moving entreaties of the sufferers, mingled with sounds of reproach,1 compelled them to undergo.
The most excellent characters, accordingly, incurred this kind of death most frequently.
Those, moreover, who strove to bury the multitude of their dead, one after another,2 returned home overcome with weep­ ing and mourning.
Hence men were stretched on their beds in great numbers, through sorrow and despondency;
nor could any one be found, whom, in such a time of calamity, neither disease, nor death, nor mourningfor the loss offriends, had af­ fected.
Besides, as the pestilence now spread, every shepherd and herdsman, as well as every stout driver of the crooked plough, languished under the infection;
their bodies lay cooped up within their narrow huts, consigned to death from the effects of want and disease.
You might have seen the dead corpses of parents stretched on their dead children, and sometimes, again, children expiring on the bodies of their mothers and fathers.
And this affliction was brought, in no small portion, into the city from the country;
affliction which a sick and in­ fected multitude of rustics, flocking together from all parts, introduced.
They crowded all places of reception and of shelter;
for which reason, as they were thus crammed toge­ titer, death the more easily strewed them in heaps by the force of contagion.
Many bodies, from the effects of thirst, lay stretched at the public conduits,3 prostrate and extended along the road, their breath having been stopped by too great indulgence in the deliciousness of the water.
And every where, along the open and public roads,4 you might have seen powerless limbs, with halt-dead bodies of men, horrible with squalor, covered with rags, and perishing for want of dressing;
there was skin only on the bones,1 which was itself now almost sunk away, by rea­ son of disease of the viscera, and overspreading filth.
All the sacred temples of the gods, moreover, death had now crowded with carcasses;
all the shrines of the divini­ ties, in every part, stood filled with corpses;
for these were places which the attendants of the temples had thronged with strangers.
Nor, indeed, was the worship of the gods, or their divinities, much regarded;
for present suffering overcame religious considerations.
Nor was the custom of sepulture,2 with which that pious people had always been accustomed to bury,1 observed longer in the city.
For the whole people, in perturbation, ran hither and thither ;
2 and each in his sorrow buried his friend accord­ ing to his means.
Dire poverty, too, with sudden impulse, prompted men to many impious deeds;
for they placed their relatives, with loud outcries, on the funeral piles raised for others,3 and ap­ plied torches to them;
often even quarrelling, with great bloodshed, rather than the bodies should be left unconsumed.
Thus abruptly ends the description of the plague, and the poem of Lucretius.
Much of the account of the pestilence, as is observed above, is taken from Thucydides.
I have not thought it necessary to trans­ cribe in the notes the passages of Thucydides which Lucretius imi­ tates ;
the English reader may refer to the whole description in Mr. Dale's Thucydides;
and the scholar has ample references in Lam­ binus and Creech.
Procopius has given a full account of the plague which began to spread through the world, and devastated the city of Constantinople, in the reign of Justinian ;
an account in which Gibbon says that he " has emulated the skill and diligence of Thucydides in his descrip­ tion of the plague at Athens."
It is observable that he represents it, like that of Athens, as taking its rise from Egypt. " Ethiopia and Egypt," says Gibbon, (ch. xliii. sub fin.,) "have been stigmatized, in every age, as the great source and seminary of the plague.
In a damp, hot, stagnating air, this African fever is generated from the putrefaction of animal substances, and especially from the swarms of locusts, not less destructive to mankind in their death than in their lives.
"The assertion of Macrobius, (Sat. vi. 2,) that Virgil took the prin­ cipal colouring and features of his description of a pestilence an.ong cattle (Georg. iii. 478—566) from Lucretius's picture of the Athenian plague, rests on very slight foundation.
Virgil may have been in­ duced to write his description in emulation of that of Lucretius;
but very little that is actually copied will be found in it.
In Ovid's description of the same Athenian pestilence, (Metam. vii. 523—613,) the attentive reader will find far more marks of imitation.
Silius Italicus (xiv. 580—617) also, like his great predecessors, gives a description of the plague which attacked the Roman army at the siege of Syracuse.
Many of his points are taken from Lu­ cretius, as in the following passage:
Helpless the victims sunk;
the tongue was parched;
Cold perspiration o'er the trembling frame Flowed copious;
while the tumid throat forbade
The food's half-forced descent;
a vehement cough Shook the vexed lungs;
and from the arid mouth Fumed fiery breath, that ceaseless thirst proclaimed.
The eyes, that scarce th' oppressive light could bear, Sunk in deep ghastly hollows by the side
Of the sharp nose;
foul bile, commixed with blood, Forth gushes from the stomach;
the weak limbs, Fleshless and wasted, shrink to skin and bone.
The general features of pestilential destruction are also carefully detailed by Seneca in his Œdipus, Act i.Thomson has a passage on the effects of pestilence, Summer, ver. 1026, seq.
Boccacio, in his description of the plague at Florence, seems to have had Thucydides in view.
If the reader wish to see more accounts of pestilence, in imagin­ ative writers, he may consult Defoe's History of the Plague - Wilson's City of the Plague:

by gods and men beloved, Benignant VENUS!
thou, the sail-clad main
And fruitful earth, as round the seasons roll, With life who swellest, for by thee all live, And, living, hail the cheerful light of day :
—
Thee, goddess, at thy glad approach, the winds.
The tempests fly :
dedalian Earth to thee Pours forth her sweetest flow'rets:
Ocean laughs, And the blue heavens in cloudless splendour decked.
For, when the Spring first opes her frolic eye, And genial zephyrs long locked up respire, Thee, goddess, then, th' aerial birds confess, To rapture stung through every shivering plume:
Thee, the wild herds ;
hence, o'er the joyous glebe Bounding at large;
or, with undaunted chest, Stemming the torrent tides.
Through all that lives
So, by thy charms, thy blandishments overpowered, Springs the warm wish thy footsteps to pursue:
Till through the seas, the mountains, and the floods, The verdant meads, and woodlands filled with song Spurred by desire each palpitating tribe Hastes, at thy shrine, to plant, the future race.
Since, then, with universal sway thou rul'st, And thou alone;
nor aught without thee springs, Aught gay or lovely;
thee I woo to guide Aright my flowing song, that aims to paint To MEMMIUS' view the ESSENCES OF THINGS:
MEMMIUS, my friend, by thee, from earliest youth, O goddess ! led, and trained to every grace.
Then, 0, vouchsafe thy favour, power divine!
And with immortal eloquence inspire.
Quell, too, the fury of the hostile world, And lull to peace, that all the strain may hear.
For peace is thine:
on thy soft bosom he, The warlike field who sways, almighty MARS, Struck by triumphant Love's eternal wound, Reclines full frequent:
with uplifted gaze
On thee he feeds his longing, lingering eyes, And all his soul hangs quivering from thy lips.
O! while thine arms in fond embraces clasp
His panting members, sovereign of the heart!
Ope thy bland voice, and intercede for ROME.
For, while th' unsheathed sword is brandished, vain
And all unequal is the poet's song ;
And vain th' attempt to claim his patron's ear.
Son of the MEMMII!
thou, benignant, too, Freed from all cares, with vacant ear attend ;
Nor turn, contemptuous, ere the truths I sing, For thee first harmonized, are full perceived.
Lo! to thy view I spread the rise of things;
Unfold th' immortals, and their blest abodes :
How Nature all creates, sustains, matures, And how, at length, dissolves;
what forms the muss, Termed by the learned, Matter, Seeds of Things, And generative Atoms, or, at times, Atoms primordial, as hence all proceeds.
Far, far from mortals, and their vain concerns,
In peace perpetual dwell th' immortal gods:
Each self-dependent, and from human wants Estranged for ever.
There, nor pain pervades, Nor danger threatens;
every passion sleeps;
Vice no revenge, no rapture virtue prompts.
Not thus mankind.
Them long the tyrant power Of SUPERSTITION swayed, uplifting proud Her head to heaven, and with horrific limbs Brooding o'er earth;
till he, the man of Greece, Auspicious rose, who first the combat dared, And broke in twain the monster's iron rod.
No thunder him, no fell revenge pursued
Of heaven incensed, or deities in arms.
Urged rather, hence, with more determined soul, To burst through Nature's portals, from the crew!
With jealous caution closed;
the flaming walls
Of heaven to scale, and dart his dauntless eye, Till the vast whole beneath him stood displayed.
Hence taught he us, triumphant, what might spring, And what forbear:
what powers inherent lurk, And where their bounds and issues.
And, hence, we- Triumphant too, o'er SUPERSTITION rise, Contemn her terrors, and unfold the heavens.
Nor deem the truths PHILOSOPHY reveals Corrupt the mind, or prompt to impious deeds.
No:
SUPERSTITION may, and nought so soon, But Wisdom never.
SUPERSTITION 'twas Urged the fell GRECIAN chiefs, with virgin blood, To stain the virgin altar.
Barbarous deed !
And fatal to their laurels !
AULIS saw, For there DIANA reigns, th' unholy rite.
Around she looked ;
the pride of GRECIAN maids,
The lovely IPHIGENIA, round she looked,- Her lavish tresses, spurning still the bond Of sacred fillet, flaunting o'er her cheeks,- And sought, in vain, protection.
She surveyed Near her, her sad, sad sire;
th' officious priests Repentant half, and hiding their keen steel, And crowds of gazers weeping as they viewed.
Dumb with alarm, with supplicating knee, And lifted eye, she sought compassion still;
Fruitless and unavailing:
vain her youth, Her innocence, and beauty ;
vain the boast Of regal birth ;
and vain that first herself Lisped the dear name of Father, eldest born.
Forced from her suppliant posture, straight she viewed
The altar full prepared :
not there to blend Connubial vows, and light the bridal torch ;
But, at the moment when mature in charms, While Hymen called aloud, to fall, e'en then, A father's victim, and the price to pay Of GRECIAN navies, favoured thus with gales.-
Such are the crimes that SUPERSTITION prompts !
And dost thou still resist us ?
trusting still
The fearful tale by priests and poets told ?— I, too, could feign such fables;
and combine
As true to fact.
and of as potent spell, To freeze thy blood, and harrow every nerve.—
Nor wrong th' attempt.
Were mortal man assured Eternal death would close this life of woe, And nought remain of curse beyond the grave, E'en then religion half its force would lose ;
Vice no alarm, and virtue feel no hope.
But, whilst the converse frights him, man will dread Eternal pain, and flee from impious deeds.
Yet doubtful is the doctrine, and unknown Whether, co-eval with th' external frame, The soul first lives, when lives the body first, Or boasts a date anterior:
whether doomed To common ruin, and one common grave, Or through the gloomy shades, the lakes, the caves, Of EREBUS to wander:
or, perchance, As ENNIUS taught, immortal bard, whose brows Unfading laurels bound, and still whose verse All Rome recites, entranced -perchance condemned
The various tribes of brutes, with ray divine, To animate and quicken:
though the bard, In deathless melody, has elsewhere sung Of ACHERUSIAN temples, where, nor soul Nor body dwells, but images of men, Mysterious shaped;
in wondrous measure wan.
Here HOMER'S spectre roamed, of endless fame Possest:
his briny tears the bard surveyed, And drank the dulcet precepts from his lips.
Such are the various creeds of men.
And hence
The philosophic sage is called t' explain, Not the mere phases of the heavens alone, The sun's bright path, the moon's perpetual change.
And powers of earth productive, but to point, In terms appropriate, the dissevering lines 'Twixt mind and brutal life;
and prove precise Whence spring those shadowy forms, which, e'en in hours Wakeful and calm.
but chief when dreams molest, Or dire disease, we see, or think we see, Though the dank grave have long their bones inhumed.
Yet not unknown to me how hard the task Such deep obscurities of GREECE t' unfold In LATIN numbers;
to combine new terms, And strive with all our poverty of tongue.-
But such thy virtue, and the friendship pure
My bosom bears, that arduous task I dare;
And yield the sleepless night, in hope to cull Some happy phrase, some well-selected verse, Meet for the subject;
to dispel each shade, And bid the mystic doctrine hail the day.
For shades there are, and terrors of the soul, The day can ne'er disperse, though blazing strong With all the sun's bright javelins.
These alone To Nature yield, and Reason;
and, combined, This is the precept they for ever teach, That NOUGHT FROM NOUGHT BY POWER DIVINE HAS RISEN.
But the blind fear, the superstition vain Of mortals uninformed, when spring, perchance, In heaven above, or earth's sublunar scene, Events to them impervious, instant deem Some power supernal present, and employed.-
Admit this truth, that NOUGHT FROM NOTHING SPRINGS, And all is clear.
Developed, then, we trace, Through Nature's boundless realm, the rise of things.
Their modes, and powers innate;
nor need from heaven
Some god's descent to rule each rising fact.
Could things from nought proceed, then whence the use
Of generative atoms, binding strong Kinds to their kinds perpetual ?
Man himself
Might spring from ocean ;
from promiscuous earth
The finny race, or feathery tribes of heaven:
Prone down the skies the bellowing herds might bound, Or frisk from cloud to cloud:
while flocks, and beasts Fierce and most savage, undefined in birth, The field or forest might alike display.
Each tree, inconstant to our hopes, would bend With foreign fruit:
and all things all things yield.
Whence but from elemental seeds that act With truth, and power precise, can causes spring Powerful and true themselves ?
But grant such seeds,
And all, as now, through Nature's wide domain, In time predicted, and predicted place, Must meet the day concordant;
must assume
The form innately stampt, and prove alone Why all from all things never can proceed.
Whence does the balmy rose possess the spring ?
The yellow grain the summer ?
or, the vine
With purple clusters, cheer th' autumnal hours ?
Whence, true to time, if such primordial seeds
Act not harmonious, can aught here surveyed, Aught in its season, rear its tender form, And the glad earth protrude it to the day ?
But, if from nought things rise, then each alike, In every spot, at every varying month, Must spring discordant;
void of primal seeds
To check all union till th' allotted hour.
Nor space for growth would then be needful:
all Springing from nought, and still from nought supplied.
The puny babe would start abrupt to man;
And trees umbrageous, crowned with fruit mature, Burst, instant, from the greensward.
But such facts Each day opposes;
and, opposing, proves
That all things gradual swell from seeds defined, Of race and rank observant, and intent T' evince th' appropriate matter whence they thrive..
But matter thus appropriate, or e'en space For growth mature, form not the whole required.
The timely shower from heaven must add benign Its influence too, ere yet the teeming earth Emit her joyous produce;
or, the ranks
Of man and reptile, thence alone sustained, May spring to life, and propagate their kinds.
Say rather, then, in much that meets the view, That various powers combine, concordant all, Common and elemental, as in words Such elemental letters,-than contend, That void of genial atoms, aught exists.
Why formed not Nature man with ample powers
To fathom, with his feet, th' unbottomed main ?
To root up mountains with his mighty hands ?
Or live o'er lapsing ages victor still ?
Why, but because primordial matter, fixt And limited in act, to all is dealt
Of things created, whence their forms expand.
And hence again we learn, and prove express, Nought springs from nought, and that, from seeds precise, Whatever is formed must meet th' ethereal day.
Mark how the cultured soil the soil excels Uncultured, richer in autumnal fruits.
Here, too, the latent principle of things, Freed by the plough, the fertile glebe that turns
And subjugates the sod, exert their power, And swell the harvest:
else, spontaneous, all Would still ascend by labour unimproved.
And as from nought the genial seeds of things Can never rise, so Nature that dissolves
Their varying forms, to nought can ne'er reduce.
Were things destructible throughout, then all Abrupt would perish, passing from the sight;
Nor foreign force be wanting to disjoin Their vital parts, or break th' essential bond.
But since, from seeds eternal all things rise, Till force like this prevail, with sudden stroke Crushing the living substance, or within Deep entering each interstice, to dissolve All active, Nature no destruction views.
Were time the total to destroy of all
By age decayed,-say whence could VENUS' self
The ranks renew of animated life ?
Or, if renewed, whence earth's dedalian power Draw the meet foods to nurture, and mature ?
Whence springs and rivers, with perpetual course, The deep supply ?
or, ether feed the stars ?
Whatever could perish, ever-during time, And rolling ages, must have long destroyed.
But if, through rolling ages, and the lapse
Of ever-during time, still firm at base, Material things have stood, then must that base Exist immortal, and the fates defy.
Thus, too, the same efficient force applied Alike must all things rupture, if, within, No substance dwelled eternal to maintain In close, and closer, links their varying bonds.
E'en the least touch,-for every cause alike Must break their textures, equal in effect, If no imperishable power opposed,- E'en touch were then irrevocable death.
But since, with varying strength, the seeds within Adhere, of form precise, and prove express
Their origin eternal,-free from ill, And undivided must those forms endure, Till some superior force the compact cleave.
Thus things to nought dissolve not;
but, subdued, Alone return to elemental seeds.
When, on the bosom of maternal EARTH, His showers redundant genial ETHER pours, The dulcet drops seem lost:
but harvests rise, Jocund and lovely;
and, with foliage fresh, Smiles every tree, and bends beneath its fruit.
Hence man and beast are nourished ;
hence overflow
Our joyous streets with crowds of frolic youth;
And with fresh songs th' umbrageous groves resound.
Hence the herds fatten, and repose at ease, O'er the gay meadows, their unwieldy forms;
While from each full-distended udder drops
The candid milk spontaneous;
and hence, too, With tottering footsteps, o'er the tender grass, Gambol their wanton young, each little heart Quivering beneath the genuine nectar quaffed.
So nought can perish, that the sight surveys, With utter death;
but Nature still renews Each from the other, nor can form afresh One substance, till another be destroyed.
But come, my friend, and, since the muse has sung
Things cannot spring from, or return to nought, Lest thou should'st urge, still sceptic, that no eye
Their generative atoms e'er has traced ;
Mark in what scenes thyself must own, perforce, Still atoms dwell, though viewless still to sense.
And, first, th' excited wind torments the deep ;
Wrecks the tough bark, and tears the shivering clouds:
Now, with wide whirlwind, prostrating alike O'er the waste champaign, trees, and bending blade;
And now, perchance, with forest-rending force, Rocking the mighty mountains on their base.
So vast its fury !
—But that fury flows Alone from viewless atoms, that, combined, Thus form the fierce tornado, raging wild O'er heaven, and earth, and ocean's dread domain.
As when a river, down its verdant banks Soft-gliding, sudden from the mountains round Swells with the rushing rain-the placid stream All limit loses, and, with furious force, In its resistless tide, bears down, at once, Shrubs, shattered trees, and bridges, weak alike Before the tumbling torrent:
such its power !—
Loud roars the raging flood, and triumphs still, O'er rocks, and mounds, and all that else contends.
So roars th' enraged wind:
so, like a flood, Where'er it aims, before its mighty tide, Sweeps all created things :
or round, and round, In its vast vortex curls their tortured forms.-
Though viewless, then, the matter thus that acts, Still there is matter:
and, to Reason's ken, Conspicuous as the visual texture traced
In the wild wave that emulates its strength.
Next, what keen eye e'er followed, in their course, The light-winged ODOURS ?
or developed clear
The mystic forms of cold, or heat intense ?
Or sound through ether fleeting ?-yet, though far From human sight removed, by all confessed Alike material;
since alike the sense
They touch impulsive;
and since nought can touch
But matter;
or, in turn, be touched itself.
Thus, too, the garment that along the shore, Lashed by the main, imbibes the briny dew, Dries in the sunbeam :
but, alike unseen, Falls the moist ether, or again flies off Entire, abhorrent of the red-eyed noon.
So fine the attenuated spray that floats
In the pure breeze ;
so fugitive to sight.
A thousand proofs spring up.
The ring that decks
The fair one's finger, by revolving years, Wastes imperceptibly.
The dropping shower Scoops the rough rock.
The plough's attempered share Decays:
and the thick pressure of the crowd, Incessant passing, wears the stone-paved street.
E'en the gigantic forms of solid brass, Placed at our portals, from the frequent touch
Of devotees and strangers, now display The right hand lessened of its proper bulk.-
All lose, we view, by friction, their extent;
But, in what time, what particles they lose, This envious Nature from our view conceals.
Thus, too, both Time and Nature give to things A gradual growth:
but never yet the sight
That gradual growth explored ;
nor marked their fall, Still gradual too, by age, or sure decay:
Nor traced what portions of incumbent rock, Loaded with brine, the caustic wave dissolves.-
So fine the particles that form the world.
Yet not corporeal is the whole produced By Nature.
In created things exists, Search where thou wilt, an INCORPOREAL VOID.
This mark, and half philosophy is thine.
Doubtful no longer shalt thou wander:
taught Th' entire of things, and by our verse convinced.
And know this VOID is SPACE UNTOUCHED and PURE.
Were SPACE like this vouchsafed not, nought could move:
Corporeal forms would still resist, and strive With forms corporeal, nor consent to yield;
While the great progress of creation ceased.
But what more clear in earth or heaven sublime, Or the vast ocean, than, in various modes, That various matter moves ?
which, but for SPACE, 'Twere vain t' expect:
and vainer yet to look For procreative power, educing still Kinds from their kinds through all revolving time.
True, things are solid deemed:
but know that those Deemed so the most are rare and unconjoined.
From rocks, and caves, translucent lymph distils, And, from the tough bark, drops the healing balm.
The genial meal, with mystic power, pervades Each avenue of life;
and the grove swells, And yields its various fruit, sustained alone From the pure food propelled through root and branch.
Sound pierces marble;
through reclusest walls
The bosom-tale transmits:
and the keen frost E'en to the marrow winds its sinuous way.-
Destroy all vacuum, then, close every pore, And, if thou canst, for such events account.
Say, why of equal bulk, in equal scale, Are things oft found unequal in their poise ?
O'er the light wool the grosser lead prevails
With giant force.
But were th' amount alike
Of matter each contained, alike the weight Would prove perpetual:
for, from matter sole, Flows weight, and moment, ever prone to earth:
While vacant space nor weight nor moment knows.
Where things surpoise, then, though of equal bulk, There MATTER most resides:
but where ascends
The beam sublime, the rising substance holds A smaller share, and larger leaves the VOID.
Hence draws the sage his creed:
in all produced Finds vacuum still, and calls that vacuum SPACE.
But some there are such doctrines who deny:
And urge in proof, deceptive, that we wave Not through imagined pores admits the race With glittering scales-but yields at once, and opes
The liquid path ;
and occupies, in turn, The space behind the aureat fish deserts.
Thus, too, that all things act:
the spot possessed Exchanging sole, while each continues full.
Believe them not.
If nought of space the wave Give to its gilded tenants, how, resolve, Feel they the power t' advance ?
and if t' advance
They know not, how can, next, the wave thus yield ?—
Or matter ne'er can move, then, or within Some VOID must mix through all its varying forms, Whence springs alone the power of motion first.
When force mechanic severs, and, abrupt, Drives two broad bodies distant, quick between Flows the light air, and fills the vacuum formed.
But ne'er so rapid can the light air flow
As to forbid all void;
since, step by step, It still must rush till the whole space be closed.
Nor credit those who urge such bodies sole Can part because the liquid air, compress'd
To closer texture, gives the needed space.
Such feeble reas'ners, in opposing VOID, A double VOID confess:
for, first, perforce, A void they own, where void was none before, Betwixt the substance severed;
and bring next A proof surmountless that the air itself Thronged with a prior void:
else how, to bounds
Of closer texture, could it e'er contract ?
A thousand facts crowd round me:
to the same Converging all.
But ample these, I ween, Though but the footsteps of the mighty whole, To fix thy faith, and guide thee to the rest.
For as the hound, when once the tainted dew His nostrils taste, pursues the vagrant fox O'er hills, and dales, and drags him from his lair;
So may'st thou trace from fact associate fact, Through every maze, through every doubtful shade, Till Truth's bright form, at length, thy labours crown.
Nor tardy be the toil, for much remains.
So oft, 0 MEMMIUS !
from the sacred fount
By wisdom fed, so largely have I drank,
And such the dulcet doctrines yet untold, That age may first unman us, and break down
The purple gates of life, ere the bold muse Exhaust the boundless subject.
Haste we, then, Each pulse is precious, haste we to proceed.
Know, then, th' ENTIRE OF NATURE sole consists Of SPACE and BODY:
this the substance moved, And that the area of its motive power.
That there is BODY, every sense we boast Demonstrates strong:
and, if we trust not sense.
Source of all science, then the mind itself, Perplexed and hopeless, must still wander on In reasoning lost, to every doubt a prey.
And were not SPACE, were vacuum not allow'd, In nought could bodies, then, their powers display Of various action:
each compressing each To motion fatal, as already sung.
Nor is there aught such vacant SPACE besides, And MATTER close-embodied, can be traced A substance forming discrepant from each.
Search where thou wilt, whatever occurs to view, Of bulk minute, or large, though e'en its form Change with the hour, if tangible it prove, This stamps it MATTER, and forbids all doubt.
But if intangible, throughout if still To matter pervious, act where'er it may, 'Tis then void SPACE, and can be nought besides.
All things, moreo'er, a substance must evince Acting, or suffering act;
or, form the sphere In which to act or suffer.
But to act, Or suffer action, must be MATTER'S sole ;
While SPACE alone that needed sphere admits.
Nought, then, 'twixt SPACE and MATTER can subsist Of INTERMEDIATE SUBSTANCE:
nought be traced By keenest efforts of th' external sense, Or by the meditating mind deduced.
All else we meet with or conceive but these Are mere CONJUNCTIONS, or EVENTS attached.
And know the learned by CONJUNCTIONS name
Those powers in each perpetual that inhere, And ne'er can part till VOID or MATTER cease.
Thus heat to fire, fluidity to streams, Weight to the rock, to all of MATTER touch, And want of touch to SPACE.
While Discord, Peace, Oppression, Freedom, Poverty, and Wealth,
And aught that else, of matter, and of space Lives independent, though engendered hence, Are termed, and justly, by the wise EVENTS.
E'en TIME, that measures all things, of itself Exists not;
from the mind alone produced, As, link by link, contemplating minute, Things present, past, or future:
for, of TIME, From these disjoined, in motion, or at rest Tranquil and still, what mortal can conceive?
Thus spring EVENTS to birth.
The rape renowned Of beauteous HELEN, or the fall of TROY, Though deemed existences, yet of themselves Existed never:
on material things, On place and persons acting, or coerced, Alone dependent.
These revolving years
Have long th* irrevocable doom assigned:
And rape and conquest, as EVENTS that claimed From these existence, now exist no more.
-Had ne'er been formed the matter, or the space, Whose power conjunctive gave those scenes to be;
No fire had e'er, from lovely HELEN'S eyes, Glanced through the bosom of the TROJAN youth, And kindled the fierce flames of storied war:
No giant horse the fell ACHAIAN throngs Poured forth at night, subverting PRIAM'S realm.
Mark, then, how different FACTS exist and blend From VOID or MATTER;
and how justly termed
Of place and body the derived EVENTS.
Know, too, that bodies, in their frame consist, Part, of primordial atoms uncombined, And part combined and blending :
these alone Pervious and rare;
while those so solid formed No force create can sever, or dissolve.
Nor deem such solids doubtful:
though so deemed By sages oft, who plausibly object
That sound, that thunder, that the voice itself Breaks through domestic walls:
that rigid steel Admits the blaze, and whitens :
vitreous rocks
Melt in the fierce volcano:
gold and brass Forego their icy hardness, and alike Yield in the fiery conflict, and dissolve:
That e'en the silver chalice, fill'd with lymph Fervid or cold, unlocks its secret pores, And warms, at once, or chills th' embracing hand.
Hence deem they matter pervious all, and void Of solid substance.
But attend, benign, And, since right reason, and the frame of things Demand the verse, the muse shall briefly prove
The seeds, the principles of matter all Both solid, and eternal, whence alone Springs the stupendous fabric of the world.
Of SPACE, of MATTER, as already sung, Th' ENTIRE of things consists, by nature formed Distinct and adverse;
and existing pure Each uncontrolled of each.
Where matter dwells
Void space can ne'er be found, nor matter found, Search where thou wilt, where space resides and reigns.
As space is vacant then, material seeds
Must solid prove, perforce, and free from void.
Thus, too, as vacuum dwells in all produced, Some solid substance must that vacuum bound:
Nor aught of vacuum can created things
Be proved to enclose, if solids not exist, Whose power alone can such enclosures form.
But solids must be matter;
the prime seeds
Of all surveyed, harmonious in their act, And undecayed when all decays around.
Were there no space, th' ENTIRE OF THINGS would prove One boundless solid :
and were nought conceived
Of viewless seeds, close filling, void of space, Each spot possest, all then were vacuum blank.
Thus each from each, from matter space exists Distinct and clear:
since never all is void, Nor ever full;
but this from that preserved By countless atoms acting though unseen.
These, as already sung, no powers can pierce:
O'er blows external, 9'er each vain attempt
Of penetrative solvents, or aught else Philosophy reveals, triumphant still.
For nought can break, of vacuum all devoid, Or melt, or moulder, or within admit Vapour, or cold, or power of pungent heat, By which dissolves this fabric of the world.
'Tis vacuum lays the base:
as this exists, Augments, or lessens, things alone decay.
What then is solid, and from vacuum free, Must undecayed, and still eternal live.
Were matter not eternal, ages since All had returned to nothing whence it sprang, And from that nothing all again revived.
But since from nothing nought can ever rise, As proved above, nor aught to nothing shrink, Seeds there must be of ever-during date, To which, perpetual, things dissolve, or whence Flows the fresh pabulum that all repairs.
But seeds thus simple must be solid too;
Else unpreserved through countless ages past, And useless to recruit th' exhausted world.
Else friction, too, had injured:
each by each Through myriad years abraded, and reduced, Till nought conceptible had lived to rear, Each in its time, the progenies of earth:
For all is wasted easier than renewed.
And hence, had all been thus disturbed, dissolved, And frittered through the long anterior lapse
Of countless ages, future time in vain Would strive the ruined fragments to repair.
But what more obvious than that bounds exist
To matter decompounding, primal seeds
To forms defined coercing;
since again All springs to birth, harmonious, kinds from kinds, True to their times, and perfect in their powers ?
Yet, though the principles of matter thus Prove firm and solid, its component forms, As air, earth, vapour, or translucent stream, May still be soft and pliant, as combined, E'en from their birth, with less, or larger void.
But had those principles themselves been reared Pliant and soft, then whence the sturdy steel, The close-compacted flint, or aught besides, Of equal texture, traced through Nature's realm ?
Thus simple solids must be still contest;
And all be soft, or rigid, as of these In more or less concentrate mode composed.
To all has Nature given a bound precise Of being and perfection ;
and promulged, To every varying rank, her varying laws;
Urging to this, from that restraining firm.
Nought suffers change:
the feathery tribes of heaven Bear, on their glossy plumes, through every class, The same fixt hues that first those classes stamped.
Hence matter too, through all its primal steels, Is proved immutable:
for if, o'ercome By aught of foreign force, those seeds could change, All would be doubtful;
nor the mind conceive
What might exist, or what might never live:
Nor why, decide, such variance in their powers, And final terms of life, or instinct strong, Through every age, still urging every race To each pursuit, each action of their sires.
Know, too, each seed, each substance is composed
Of points extreme no sense can e'er detect:
Points that, perforce, minutest of themselves, To parts can ne'er divide:
nor self-educed, Nor, but as formed, existing, else destroyed.
Parts such can hold not:
each the first, pure part, Itself, of other substance:
which, when joined Alone by kindred parts, in order due, Forms, from such junction, the prime seeds of things.
But e'en such parts, though by the mind as parts Conceived, disjoined can ne'er exist;
and thence Adhere by firm, indissoluble bond.
Thus seeds are simple solids, formed compact
Of points extreme, that never can recede :
Not lab'ring jointly to produce some end, But potent from simplicity alone, And hence eternal:
equally unprone To waste or sever;
and by nature kept To feed the suffering fabric of the world.
Di i no such points exist, extreme and least, Each smallest atom would be, then, combined Of parts all infinite;
for every part Parts still would boast, dividing without end.
And, say, what difference could there, then, subsist 'Twixt large and small ? for though th' ENTIRE OF things Should infinite be deemed, each smallest speck Still parts as infinite would hold embraced.
But since at this the reasoning mind revolts, Then must it own, overpowered, that points exist Least by their nature, and of parts devoid:
And solid, hence, and of eternal date.
Hence seeds arise, the last, least parts conceived
Of actual being:
the extremest points To which creative Nature all resolves.
Which, if not least, if still of parts possest, Could ne'er, with close exactitude, renew The universal frame:
all, all would rise Of weight diverse, and ever varying form, Casual in tie, in motion undefined.
Yet should we grant that matter, without end, For ever wastes;
e'en then, from earliest time, Some matter must have triumphed undecayed, Cohering still:
but what can thus cohere, What brave the unnumbered repercussions felt Through ages now evolved, can ne'er decay:
Alike the future conquering as the past.
Hence those who deem the fabric of the world Educed from FIRE, itself the source of all, Far wander from the truth.
Thus deemed the sage, Chief of his sect, and fearless in the fight, Famed HERACLITUS ;
by the learn'd esteemed
Of doubtful phrase, mysterious;
but revered By crowds of GRECIANS, flimsy, and untaught.
For such th' obscure applaud;
delighted most With systems dark, and most believing true
The silver sounds that charm th' enchanted ear.
But whence, I ask, if all from FIRE proceed Unmixed and simple, spring created things
So various in their natures ?
Urge not here
That fire condenses now, and now expands;
For if the same, divided or entire, Its parts condensed a heat can only prove More fierce;
and less when rarefied, and thin.
Still all is FIRE.
Nor canst thou e'er conceive From fire that aught can spring but fire itself.
Much less, in fire made dense alone, or rare, Trace the vast variance of created things.
Dense, too, and rare a vacuum must imply, As urged already;
yet full well convinced
What straits surround them if a void exist, Such sages doubt, but, doubting, still deny:
Fearful of danger, yet averse from truth.
Such, too, reflect not that from things create, Should void withdraw, the whole at once were den.e,
One solid substance all, and unempowered Aught from itself t' eject, as light, and smoke Flies from the purple flame;
evincing clear Its parts unsolid, and commixt with void.
But should it still, perchance, be urged, that fires Perish by junction, and their substance change, Then must that changing substance waste to nought;
And thus from nought th' ENTIRE of nature spring.
For what once changes, by the change alone Subverts immediate its anterior life.
But still, victorious, something must exist, Or all to nought would perish;
and, in turn, From nought regerminate to growth mature.
Yet though, most certain, things there are exist
That never change, the seeds of all surveyed, Whose presence, absence, or arrangement new That ALL new-models, certain 'tis, alike, Those seeds can ne'er be FIRE.
For what avails Such absence, presence, or arrangement new Of igneous matter, if the whole throughout Alike be igneous ?
Change howe'er it may, Through every variance all must still be flame.—
Ask'st thou whence fire proceeds then ?
As I deem, From certain seeds to certain motions urged, Or forms, or combinations;
which, when changed, Change too their nature ;
and, though yielding fire, Not fire resembling, or aught else perceived By human sense, or tangible to touch.
To hold, moreover, as HERACLITUS held, That all is fire, and nought besides exists Through Nature's boundless fabric, is to rave.
T' oppose the mental sense, erroneous oft, To sense external, whence all knowledge flows, And whence himself first traced that flame exists.
To sense he trusts, when sense discloses fire, And yet distrusts in things disclosed as clear.
Can there, in man, be conduct more absurd ! —
Where shall we turn us ?
Where, if thus we fly Those senses chief that sever true from false ?
—Why, rather, too, should all that else exists
Be thus denied, and fire alone maintained, Than fire denied, and all maintained besides ?
Tenets alike preposterous and wild.
Hence those, in FIRE, who trace the rise of things,
And nought but FIRE;
or those for AIR who strive
As source of all;
or those the dimpling STREAM Who fondly fancy;
or the ponderous EARTH, For each has armed its champions in its turn, Alike wide wander from unerring truth.
Nor wanders less the sage who AIR with FIRE Would fain commix, or limpid STREAM with EARTH;
Or those the whole who join, FIRE, ETHER, EARTH, And pregnant SHOWERS, and thence the world deduce.
Thus sung EMPEDOCLES, in honest fame First of his sect;
whom AGRIGENTUM bore In cloud-capt SICILY.
Its sinuous shores Th' IONIAN main, with hoarse, unwearied wave, Surrounds, and sprinkles with its briny dew:
And, fromthe fair ÆOLIAN fields, divides With narrow frith that spurns the impetuous surge.
Here vast CHARYBDIS raves:
here ÆTNA rears
His infant thunders, his dread jaws unlocks, And heaven and earth with fiery ruin threats.
Here many a wonder, many a scene sublime, As on he journeys, checks the traveller's steps ;
And shows, at once, a land in harvests rich, And rich in sages of illustrious fame.
But nought so wonderous, so illustrious nought, So fair, so pure, so lovely, can it boast, EMPEDOCLES, as thou !
whose song divine, By all rehearsed, so clears each mystic lore, That scarce mankind believed thee born of man.
Yet e'en EMPEDOCLES, and those above, Already sung, of far inferior fame, Though doctrines frequent from their bosoms flowed Like inspiration, sager and more true Than e'er the PYTHIAN maid, with laurels crowned, Spoke from the tripod at APOLLO'S shrine;
E'en these mistook the principles of things, And greatly wandered in attempt so great.
And, first, they deemed that motion might exist From VOID exempt:
that things might still be rare, Still soften, as earth, ether, fire, or fruits, Or e'en the ranks of animated life, Though VOID commixed not with their varying frames.
Then, too, they held no final term ordained To comminuting atoms:
which, through time, Still crumbled on, and never could be least.
Though from such points as sense itself surveys, Extreme and least, conjecture we may form
Of points extreme, impalpable to sight, Least in themselves, that never can divide.
With them, moreover, the seeds of things were formed Soft, and unsolid:
but whatever is soft, Whatever unsolid, as at first they spring From other substance, must perforce decay.
So all to nought would perish, and again From nought regerminate to growth mature:
Doctrines the muse already has disproved.
Such seeds, too, must be foes;
created each
To each adverse ;
and hence can never meet
But sure perdition waits:
or, chance, they part, Disperst abrupt, as, in contending storms, Wind, rain, and thunder scatter, and are lost.
But, from such four-fold foes, could all things spring, And, sprung, to such dissolve-why rather term Those jarring powers the primal seeds of things, Than things of them ?
since, in alternate course, Each flows from each:
th' alternate form is seized, Th' alternate nature, through perennial time.
Yet could'st thou deem such powers adverse might blend, And earth with fire, with ether lymph commix, And still retain their natures unimpaired;
Whilst thus retained, no living form could rise Traced through creation, animate, or void, As springs the verdant shrub, of reasoning soul.
For each its nature, through the varying mass, Would still evince, and earth with air commix, In ceaseless strife,-and fire with crystal lymph.
But primal seeds, whene'er the form of things Mutual they gender, must, perforce, assume
An unobtrusive nature, close concealed, Lest aught superior rise, of power adverse, And thus th' harmonious union be destroyed.
Such sages, too, from heaven, and heaven's bright fires Maintain that all proceeds:
that fire drawn hence Converts to ether, ether into showers, And showers benign to earth:
and hence again, That all from earth returns:
first liquid dew, Then air, and heat conclusive;
changing thus, In ceaseless revolution, changing thus From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven sublime:
A change primordial seeds could ne'er sustain.
So something still must, void of change, exist;
Or all would perish, all to nought return ;
For what once changes, by the change alone Subverts immediate its anterior life.
Since, then, as sung above, these all commute Each into each, some seeds must still be owned
That ne'er can change, or all to nought would waste.
Hold rather, then, such seeds exist, endowed With powers so curious that, as now combined, If fire they form, combine them but anew, Add, or deduct, give motion, or subtract, And all is air;
and changing thus, and changed, That things from things perpetual take their rise.
Nor urge, still sceptic, that each hour displays
All life protruded from the genial EARTH:
Fed by the balmy AIR;
by heaven's own FIRE Matured ;
and saved from pestilence and death Alone by SHOWERS benignant:
and that hence Man, beast, and herbs alike exist, and thrive.
The fact we own :
we own from solid food,
And crystal streams, man draws his daily breath, Of nerve, of bone, of being else deprived:
But, owning, add, the compounds meet for man, For brute, for herbage, differ in their kinds, By different tastes discerned:
and differ thus, And only thus, as formed from various seeds, To all things common, but in various modes Combined, and fitted to each rising want.
Nor small of import are the modes diverse
In which those seeds approach, recede, or blend:
Since heaven, and earth, and suns, and seas immense, Herbs, instinct, reason, all are hence derived:
The mode but changed, the matter still the same.
Thus, though the lines, these doctrines that recite, Flow from the same fixt elemental types, Yet line from line, in sense, in sound compared, Egregious differs.
Re-arranged alone, Such the vast power by graphic types possest !
Start not when told, then, that the seeds of things Boast powers superior, and can all create.
From such mistakes, detected and exposed, Now turn we:
and in order next survey
Those docrines first the GRECIAN schools imbibed From sapient ANAXAGORAS, by them Termed HOMŒOMERY ;
a phrase ourselves, In tongue deficient, never can translate.
But these its institutes:
that bone from bones, Minute, and embryon, nerve from nerves arise, And blood from blood, by countless drops increased.
Gold, too, from golden atoms, earths concrete From earths extreme;
from fiery matters fire, And lymph from limpid dew.
And thus throughout From primal kinds that kinds perpetual spring.
Yet VOID he granted not in aught create, Nor POINTS EXTREME that never can divide.
In both erroneous, and with those deceived Classed in our numbers, and opposed above.
Too feeble, too, the rudiments he chose, If rudiments they be, that hold, at once, The powers of things, and form the things themselves.
All toil alike, and perish void of aid:
For, when the hour of dissolution draws, Say, which can baffle the dread fangs of death ?
Can ether, lymph, or fire ?
can nerve, or bones ?
In each the strife were vain:
since all produced, Surveyed, or viewless, impotent alike, Must yield to fate, and perish unredeemed.
But things produced to nought can never fall, Or fallen, regerminate, as proved above.
Food rears the body, and its growth sustains:
But well we know its tendons, nerves, and blood, Hence all matured, are foreign and unlike.
If, then, each food be compound, if commixt With miniatures of all, of blood and nerve, Of bone and veins;
each food compact, or moist, Of parts unlike must then itself consist;
Of bone, of blood, of tendon, vein, and nerve.
Thus all things spring from earth:
but if in earth
All lurk enveloped, earth of forms consists Strange, and discordant, panting for the day.
Change still the picture, and the same still flows:
In timbers, thus, if smoke, flame, ashes blend, Then, too, those timbers hostile parts comprise.
But, here, the ready answer, framed of yore, By him, the founder of the system, springs:
That, though in all things all things lurk commixt, What most prevails, what boasts the largest share, Lies superficial, and is noticed chief.
Fruitless remark, unsolid, and untrue.
For still, at times, when crushed to dust minute Beneath the pond'rous mill-stone's mighty orb
The crumbling corn with human blood must weep, Or aught besides of fluid found in man, And stain with hues obscene:
and still, at times, Each herb unfold the balmy milk so sweet, That swells the fleecy flock, or odorous kine.
The furrowed glebe, the labouring plough beneath, Must, too, develope, in its secret womb, Plants, fruits, and foliage, oft dispersed, and hid :
And, to the woodman, the cleft stock disclose With ashes smoke, and smoke commixt with fire.
These, facts deny:
in things things ne'er exist;
But seeds of things, in various modes arranged, Various themselves:
whence rises all surveyed.
But should'st thou urge that oft beneath the storm, When rubbed by many a repercussion rude, Branch against branch, the forest's topmost height Has blazed from tree to tree;
the fact we grant:
Not, with each trunk, that native fires combine:
But that perpetual friction quick collects
Their seeds dispersed;
hence gathering ten-fold force, And flame engendering.
For could fire itself A part constituent of the forest form, No hour could hide the mischief;
every tree Would blaze, and burn till boundless ruin reigned.
See, then, as earlier sung, how much imports Th' arrangement, motion, magnitude, and form Of primal seeds combined:
and how the same, Transposed but little, fuel quick convert To flame, bright blazing up the swarthy flue:
As FLUE and FUEL, terms of different sound, Of different sense, their letters but transposed, Each into each converts with magic speed.
But should'st thou urge that all things still may flow From primal seeds, and yet those seeds possess
The form, the nature of the things themselves;
The scheme falls self-destroyed.-
For then, must seeds
Hold powers adverse;
and laugh, and shake their sides, While tears of anguish down their cheeks distil.
Come, now, and mark perspicuous what remains.
Obscure the subject:
but the thirst of fame Burns all my bosom;
and through every nerve Darts the proud love of letters, and the muse.
I feel th' inspiring power;
and roam resolved Through paths PIERIAN never trod before.
Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new;
Sweet the new flowers that bloom:
but sweeter still
Those flowers to pluck, and weave a roseate wreath, The muses yet to mortals ne'er have deigned.
With joy the subject I pursue ;
and free
The captived mind from Superstition's yoke.
With joy th' obscure illume;
in liquid verse, Graceful, and clear, depicting all surveyed:
By reason guided.
For as oft, benign,
The sapient nurse, when anxious to enforce
On the pale boy, the wormwood's bitter draught, With luscious honey tints the goblet's edge, Deceiving thus, while yet unused to guile.
His unsuspecting lip ;
till deep he drinks,
And gathers vigour from the venial cheat:
So I, since dull the subject, and the world Abashed recoils, would fain, in honeyed phrase, Tuned by the muses, to thine ear recite Its vast concerns;
if haply I may hope To fix thine audience, while the flowing verse Unfolds the nature, and the forms of things.
Taught then, already that material seeds
Are solid, and o'er time triumphant live, Attend, benignant, while we next decide Their number, or if infinite;
and tell, Since VOID throughout exists, assigning space For place and motion, if th' ENTIRE of things Be bounded, or unfathomed, and immense.
Th' ENTIRE of things, then, bounds can never know:
Else parts possest of farthest and extreme.
But parts can only be extreme, beyond
Where other substance springs, those parts extreme Binding, though sense the limit ne'er can trace.
If, then, some other substance rise, the first Forms not th' ENTIRE of things.
Whatever it be That other substance still must part compose.
Vain too is distance:
the vast whole alike
To all extends, embracing, and embraced.
Yet grant th' ENTIRE of things of bound possest.
Say, to what point shall yon keen archer, placed E'en on its utmost verge, his dart direct ?
Shall aught obstruct it, or the path be clear?
Take which thou wilt:
some substance choose, possest
Of power t' impede, and check its rapid race:
Or let it fly unconquered, nor restraint E'en once encounter:
thou must still confess Th' ENTIRE of nature nought of limit knows.
Throughout the dart I'11 chase;
and when, at length, Th' acceded bound is gained, I'll still demand
What yet obstructs it;
still new proofs adduce
That the vast whole is boundless;
and that flight Still beyond flight for ever might be urged.
Were, too, th' ENTIRE of nature thus confined, Thus circumscribed precise, from its own weight Long since, all matter to the extremest depth Had sunk supine:
nor aught the skies beneath, Nor skies themselves, with countless stars adorned And sun's unsuffering splendour, had remained.
Down, down th' accumulated mass had fallen From earliest time, devoid of power to rise.
But nought of rest supine material seeds
Evince through nature;
since no depth exists Extreme, and fathomable where those seeds
Might fix collected in inert repose.
All, all is action:
the vast whole alike Moves in each part;
and, from material seeds, Draws, undiminished, its eternal food.
Things, to the sense, are circumscribed by things.
Air bounds the hills, and hills the liquid air:
Earth ocean, ocean earth:
but the vast whole
What fancied scene can bound ?
O'er its broad realm, Immeasured, and immeasurably spread, From age to age resplendent lightnings urge, In vain their flight perpetual;
distant, still, And ever distant from the verge of things.
Is So vast the space on opening space that swells, Through every part so infinite alike.
Ask thy own reason.
It will prove at once Th' ENTIRE of nature never can have bounds.
VOID must perforce bound MATTER, MATTER VOID ;
Thus mutual, one illimitable whole Forming for ever.
For were each of each >
Free and unshackled, uncombined, and pure
In their own essence, not one short-lived hour Could earth, or ocean, the refulgent fane
Of heaven sublime, or mortal forms, or those The gods themselves inhabit, then subsist.
Freed from all order, disarranged, and rude, Through boundless vacuum the drear mass of things
Would quick be borne :
or, rather, nought had risen
From the crude chaos, joyless, and inert.
For never, doubtless, from result of thought, Or mutual compact, could primordial seeds First harmonize, or move with powers precise.
But ever changing, ever changed, and vext, From earliest time, through ever-during space, With ceaseless repercussion, every mode Of motion, magnitude, and shape essayed;
At length th' unwieldy mass the form assumed Of things created.
Persevering, thus,
Through many an age, unnumbered springs the deep Feed with perpetual tides:
by the warm sun Sustained, and cherished, earth renews her fruits, And man, and beast survive;
and ether glows With living lights innum'rous:
scenes throughout 'Twere vain t' expect, from all eternal time, Had no primordial seeds, in stores immense, Been ever nigh to renovate the world.
For as, of food deprived, the languid frame
Of man must perish, so th* ENTIRE OF THINGS Must instant cease, should once primordial seeds
Their aid withhold, or deviate in their course.
Nor deem from mutual impulse, things with things Can sole their forms preserve;
th* eternal seeds May, hence, be oft restrained, and e'en perchance, Their flight delayed, till, from th' exhaustless store, Fresh seeds arrive the fainting frame to feed:
But from concussion, frequent, they rebound, Dissolve all tie, and leave to transient rest
The common matter whence each substance springs.
Hence must incalculable seeds exist Ceaseless in act;
and the vast whole derive Alone from boundless matter impulse due.
But fly, 0 MEMMIUS, fly the sect deceived, Who teach that things, with gravitation firm, To the vast centre of th' ENTIRE, alike, Unerring press:
the world who fain would prove Void of external impulse, may subsist, And nought its post desert, profound, or high, Since of such gravitating power possest.
For canst thou deem that aught may thus sustain, And poise itself?
that aught of solid weight, Placed at earth's utmost depth, could upwards strive Reversed;
and to the surface-( in the stream As spreads the downwards shadow)—still adhere ?
For thus such sages hold:
thus man, and beast Subsist, they teach, inverted, earth beneath:
From their firm station, down their deeper skies
As unexposed to fall, as towards the heavens Ourselves to mount sublime:
by them the sun, When night to us unfolds his stars, surveyed;
And equal measuring, in alternate course, With us, their months, their darkness, and their day.
Such are the specious fancies error feigns, In idle hour, to minds perverse and vain.
Where all is infinite, what spot precise Can e'er be central ?
or were centre owned,
Why towards such spot should matter rather tend, Than elsewhere more remote, and deeper still ?
For vacant space, through every part alike, Central or not, must yield to things compact, And pond'rous, as their varying weight compels;
Nor through the boundless VOID one point exists
Where things may rest, as if of weight deprived.
No power it boasts t' uphold ;
but still recedes, - As Nature prompts, and opes the needed path.
Hence, by the love alone of centre struck, Th' harmonious frame of things could ne'er be formed.
Moreo'er such sages urge not that the whole Strives towards the centre equal;
but terrene Alone, and fluid matters;
the deep main, The mountain cataract, and the forms produced From earth Dedalian:
while the breezy air, And the light flame, far from such centre stray, Through ether trembling, and, with lambent fire, Feeding, through time, the sun's refulgent blaze;
As feeds maternal earth the myriad forms
Of herbs, and trees, and animated life, From her own bosom nurtured, and sustained.
Thus, too, they teach that heaven, with bound sublime, Encircles all things, lest the world's wide walls, And all enveloped, volatile as flame, Burst every bond, and dissipate, and die:
Lest heaven in thunders perish, and below The baseless earth forsake us, downward urged:
And loose, and lifeless, man's dissev'ring frame, Mixt with the rushing wreck of earth, and skies, Waste through all space profound;
till nought remain, Nought, in a moment, of all now surveyed, But one blank VOID, one mass of seeds inert.
For once to act, when primal atoms fail, Fail where they may, the doors of death are ope, And the vast whole unbounded ruin whelms.
These subjects if, with trivial toil, thou scan, Each, each illuming, midnight shall no more
Thy path obstruct;
but Nature's utmost depths Shine as the day :
so things irradiate things.
How sweet to stand, when tempests tear the main, On the firm cliff, and mark the seaman's toil!
Not that another's danger soothes the soul, But from such toil how sweet to feel secure!
How sweet, at distance from the strife, to view Contending hosts, and hear the clash of war!
But sweeter far on Wisdom's height serene, Upheld by Truth, to fix our firm abode;
To watch the giddy crowd that, deep below, For ever wander in pursuit of bliss;
To mark the strife for honours, and renown, For wit and wealth, insatiate, ceaseless urged, Day after day, with labour unrestrained.
O wretched mortals !-race perverse and blind!
Through what dread dark, what perilous pursuits, Pass ye this round of being !-know ye not
Of all ye toil for Nature nothing asks, But for the body freedom from disease, And sweet, unanxious quiet, for the mind ?
And little claims the body to be sound:
But little serves to strew the paths we tread With joys beyond e'en Nature's utmost wish.
What though the dome be wanting, whose proud walls A thousand lamps irradiate, propt sublime
By frolic forms of youths in massy gold, Flinging their splendours o'er the midnight feast:
Though gold and silver blaze not o'er the board, Nor music echo round the gaudy roof?
Yet listless laid the velvet grass along Near gliding streams, by shadowy trees o'er-arched, Such pomps we need not;
such still less when spring Leads forth her laughing train, and the warm year Paints the green meads with reseat flowers profuse.
On down reclined, or wrapped in purple robe, The thirsty fever burns with heat as fierce
As when its victim on a pallet pants.
Since, then, nor wealth, nor splendour, nor the boast
Of birth illustrious, nor e'en regal state Avails the body, so the free-born mind Their aid as little asks.
Unless, perchance,
The warlike host thou deem, for thee arrayed In martial pomp, and o'er the fiery field Panting for glory ;
and the gorgeous fleet, For thee unmoored, and ardent,-can dispel Each superstitious terror;
from the breast Root out the dread of death, and lull to peace
The cares, the tumults that distract thy soul.
But if all this be idle, if the CARES, The TERRORS still that haunt and harass man, Dread not the din of arms—o'er kings and chiefs Press unabashed, unawed by glittering pomp, The purple robe unheeding—canst thou doubt Man pants for these from poverty of mind, Wandering in darkness, and through life misled?
For as the boy, when midnight veils the skies, Trembles, and starts at all things, so, full oft, E'en in the noon men start at forms as void Of real danger as the phantoms false
By darkness conj ured, and the school-boy's dread.
A terror this the radiant darts of day Can ne'er disperse:
to truth's pure light alone, And wisdom yielding, intellectual suns.
Come, then, and mark how seeds primordial form Created things, and how, when formed, dissolve :
Their force, their action, whence, and power to move, Pass, and repass, through all th' immense of space:
Benign attend, while thus the muse explains.
Doubtless no substance boasts a bond within Indissoluble, since each gradual wastes, And, in the lapse of time, flies off entire, By age o'erpowered.
Yet the great mass of things Still meets the view uninjured, from the stores Sustained of primal atoms.
These, as oft
Their punctual flight they take, each form decrease, And, as they join, augment:
hence things attain Their growth mature, and thence their sure decay.
Thus, void of rest, the changeful world renews, And man on man lives mutual;
nations thus Flourish, or fade;
a few brief years roll round, And sire to son, through every reasoning rank, Yields, like a racer o'er the busy course, His lamp of life, and instant disappears.
Who deems primordial atoms e'er can rest, And, resting, urge through matter motion still, Far wanders from the truth.
Primordial seeds,
Through space unfathomed as their flight they wing, From their own gravitating power must pass, Or blows extrinsic;
each o'er each, alike, Casual prevails:
for oft the mass of seeds
That prone descends, with seeds repugnant meet
In contest tough, and distant far rebound.
Nor wondrous this, of firmest texture formed, And nought t' obstruct the retro-cursive flight.
And though thou trace the seeds unequal heaped
Of primal matter, still, reflect, th' entire Knows nought of bottom, nought of spot profound
Where they may rest collected:
space throughout Boundless exists, as, in our earlier verse, Decisive proved, on every side immense.
Since, then, primordial seeds through space profound Repose can never know:
but rather, urged To ceaseless motions, varying and adverse, By the rude conflict part far off rebound, And part with speed unite, the severing blow Surmounted soon.
Hence those, through trivial space Briefly repelled, the vigorous bond scarce broke, With quick reunion intertwining strong, Form the rude base of flints, and rigid steel, And matters firm alike:
while those beyond, Far wandering through the void, of feebler link Mutual possest, the liquid air create, And the pure light the sun perpetual pours.
Nor these the whole compose.
For seeds there are
That through the boundless void for ever stray, Of social bond abhorrent, and in turn Refused all compact in the frame of things:
Not unresembling, if aright I deem.
Those motes minute that, when th' obtrusive sun Peeps through some crevice in the shuttered shade, The day-dark hall illuming, float amain In his bright beam, and wage eternal war.
There may'st thou view them, now in crowds combine, Now part discordant, o'er the restless scene Urging the pigmy battle;
and may'st hence Learn what vast contests oft mid primal seeds, Ceaseless, prevail, through boundless space propelled.
Thus things minute instruct us, and unfold
The laws, at times, of things momentous most.
Such motes, moreover, and let the sage remark Impress thy judgment, agitated thus In the pure sun-beam, from the strife alone Prove, in their primal seeds, some motion lurks Unseen, and secret, whence the pigmy mass Draws motion first.
For oft the curious eye Sees the light goss, by viewless force subdued, Turn from the path selected, backwards urged, Now here, now there, through every point propelled.
Such the perplexing power of primal seeds.
From seeds all motion springs;
by impulse hence Through molecules minute of seeds conjoined, Nearest in power, protruded, though unseen.
Hence urged again, in turn, through things create
Of ampler form, till soon the sense itself
The congregated action marks distinct.
As in the lucid beam's light woof we trace Still motion visual, though unseen its source.
Nor small the motive power of primal seeds.
This, MEMMIUS, should'st thou doubt, we thus confirm :
When first Aurora, o'er the dewy earth, Spreads her soft light, and through the pathless grove A thousand songsters ope their liquid throats, All ether charming—sudden we survey Th' effusive sun, as with a garment, deck With his own radiance all created things;
Instant in speed, unbounded in his blaze.
But the bright fluid, the pure stream he throws, Flows not without resistance;
many a wave, Through space profound, ethereal checks its flight;
And many a self-engendered power perverse, Reared from its complex frame:
perpetual hence Lags the light fluid, doomed to double strife.
But primal atoms, firm and solid sole From pure simplicity, when through void space Free and unchecked their easy course they wing, One in themselves, at once their goal attain.
Hence than the rapid light more rapid still Rush they, in equal hour through ampler space Urged, than the beams that gild the glowing vault.
No pause for council need they, no delay, Nor deep research to sever right from wrong, Or prove what path their duty bids pursue.
Yet some there are, untaught, who dare contend Primordial matter ne'er without the gods
Thus, in nice symmetry, to please mankind, Could form th' alternate seasons, rear the fruits
That gladden life, or urge those gentler joys, Gay PLEASURE, guide and goddess of the world, Prompts in the panting breast, lest every tribe Should fail on earth, the rites of Venus spurned.
These from the gods, as sovereign cause of all, Such sophists trace, wide wandering from the truth.
For, though the rise of things I ne'er could prove, Yet dare I, from the heaven's defective frame, And many a scene alike perverse, affirm No power divine this mass material reared With ills so pregnant.
This, in order due, The muse shall full demonstrate:
turn we now To what of motion yet remains unsung.
And here, 0 Memmius!
mark this precept well;
That nought corporeal, of itself, can e'er Ascend sublime through regions urged above.
Nor let th' aspiring flame, with specious boast, Heedless deceive thee.
True, with upward flight, E'en from the first, its spreading spires unfold ;
And fruits and plants their growth still upwards urge.
Yet as the weight by all possest, below Drives all things, deem not thou, when the bright blaze Flames through th' affrighted house, the crackling roof Tumbling precipitate, then deem not thou It mounts spontaneous but from foreign force.
Thus, from the wounded vein, the vital blood Ascends, and pours its purple strength sublime:
And springs not thus the ponderous trunk immersed
In the clear stream, rejected by the wave ?
Though deep we plunge it, with redoubled force Still back it bounds, and, o'er th' elastic tide, Rears half its solid bulk.
Yet doubt we not, Spite of such facts, that all things, uncontrolled, Through space tend downward.
From control alone
The lambent flame thus mounts, towards heaven impelled, Else prone from native weight.
Falls not, at night, The mimic star, the meteor trailing long Its line of fire, whene'er, amid the gloom, Th' elastic ether opes the needed path ?
The mid-day sun flings down his rays direct
And sows the fields with light:
and the dread flash, When thunder rends the skies, though wide it dart, Now here, now there, amid the rushing rain, Its forky fires-spends its chief strength on earth.
This, too, regard intent;
that primal seeds,
When down direct their potent path they urge, In time uncertain, and uncertain space, Oft from the right decline-yet so minute Veer they, no fancy less can e'er conceive.
Without this devious curve primordial seeds
Would drop successive, like the crystal shower, Void of all contest, all re-active blow, 4 Whence Nature sole her.
world of wonders works.
If, then, there be, who deem the seeds of things More ponderous, as their rectilinear course Speeds through the void, the lighter soon may reach, And thus the repercussive war commence,— Far err they from the truth.
For though, when urged Through the pure air, or clear translucent wave, Doubtless, all ponderous forms more swift descend;
This, from the variance of resistance sole, Flows, by such fluids formed 'gainst things unlike, The grosser quick overpowering.
But pure space, In every part, in every hour the same, Throughout resists not, the demanded path Yielding submissive.
Hence, in equal time, Through the blank void, unequal weights descend
Of every fancied variance:
and hence, too, The grosser ne'er the lighter urged below Can gain, triumphant;
or the contest rouse Whence spring new motions, and all nature lives.
Hence doubly flows it why the seeds of things
Should from the right decline;
yet, in degree, The least conceptibly, lest we should deem
The line oblique which Nature ne'er assumes.
For nought more obvious, as the sight confirms, Than that all weights, their downward course, at will Steering, obliquely never can descend ;
But what keen sight of man can prove precise
That the swift cadence ne'er declines at all ?
Had all one motion uniform, the new Th' anterior skilful copying, if throughout Primordial seeds declined not, rousing hence Fresh springs of action, potent to subvert
The bonds of fate, and break the rigid chain
Of cause on cause, eternal,—whence, resolve, Flows through the world this freedom of the mind ?
This power to act, though fate the deed forbid, Urged by the will alone ?
The free-born mind Acts, or forbears, spontaneous;
its own time, Its place, alike uncertain:
these the will, Doubtless, alone determines, and, at once, Flies the fleet motion through th' assenting frame.
Dost thou not see, as down the barrier drops
That J eins the racer, instant though he dart, Not half so instant darts he as his soul Ambitious covets ?
Deep through all his frame
Th' elastic nerves must first the wish convey Ere yet the consentaneous flight succeed.
Hence, obvious, springs all motion from the heart, Roused by the mind's resolve, and instant urged Through every nerve, through every quivering limb.
A force far different this than e'er prevails
When aught without coerces.
Passive, then, Bends all the frame th' extrinsic power beneath, Borne down reluctant;
till th' awakening will Unchains each member, and resumes her right.
For oft, though foreign force, with tyrant sway, Rule us, resistless, headlong hurrying down-
Say-lurks no adverse something in the breast Proud to withstand ?
full oft, at whose control, Swift flows the nervous tide from limb to limb, Bursting each bond-and, oft, as swift retires ?
Hence firm maintain we primal seeds some cause
Must feel of rising motion unbestowed
By weight, or blow reactive, whence alone Upsprings this secret power by man possest:
Nought forming nought, as reason proves precise.
For weight forbids the credence that alone
Things by reaction move;
yet, lest the mind- Bend to a stern necessity within, And, like a slave, determine but by force,- Though urged by weight, in time, in place unfixt, Each primal atom trivial still declines.
Nor interstitial more, nor more compact, Was e'er this frame of matter;
nor augment Primaeval seeds, nor e'er admit decay.
Hence every movement in anterior time
That e'er subsisted, still subsists the same, And will through endless ages:
all begot, Begotten must be, punctual to their kinds, Exist, increase, and perish;
following firm The laws by Nature framed;
nor aught of power, Act where it may, can change th' entire of things.
For nought expands of spot where primal seeds
From the vast whole may fly ;
or e'er afresh, Armed with new powers, re-enter, adverse thus To Nature's plans, disorganizing all.
Nor this stupendous, that, though primal seeds Move on incessant, and, through different forms, Rouse different actions, the vast whole to sense Rests undisturbed.
For far beyond all ken, Lies the prime base impalpable of things.
As this eludes all vision, so, alike, Its motion too elude.
E'en oft the sight
No motion marks where still the moving scene Springs obvious, by the distance sole concealed.—
The fleecy flocks, o'er yonder hill that browse
From glebe to glebe, where'er, impearled with dew, The jocund clover calls them, and the lambs
That round them gambol, saturate with milk, Proving their frontlets in the mimic fray- Press, at this distance, on the sight confused, One white mass forming o'er the verdant steep.
Thus, too, when warlike squadrons crowd the field, Horrent in arms, with horses scarce restrained, Shaking the solid glebe, while the bright pomp Flames through the skies, and gilds the glowing earth, While groans the ground beneath their mighty tread, And hills and heavens re-echo to their shouts-
Viewed from afar, the splendid scene that spreads Seems void of motion, to the fields affixt.
Come now, my friend, and, next, perspicuous mark
What countless shapes primordial seeds assume, How vast their variance :
for, though myriads swarm
Of equal figures, oft unlike they meet.
Nor wondrous this, since, such th' abundance formed, No bounds can chain, no numbers e'er compute.
Hence, not unfrequent, each from each, through space, Must meet diverse, unkindred in their frames.
Thus Nature varies ;
man, and brutal beast, And herbage gay, and silver fishes mute, And all the tribes of heaven, o'er many a sea, Through many a grove that wing, or urge their song Near many a bank of fountain, lake or rill, Search where thou wilt, each differs in his kind, In form, in figure differs.
Hence alone, Knows the fond mother her appropriate young, Th' appropriate young their mother, 'mid the brutes, As clear discerned as man's sublimer race.
Thus oft before the sacred shrine, perfumed With breathing frankincense, th' affrighted calf Pours o'er the altar, from his breast profound, The purple flood of life.
But wandering wild
O'er the green sward, the dam, bereft of hope, Beats with her cloven hoof th' indented dale, Each spot exploring, if, perchance, she still May trace her idol;
through th' umbrageous grove, With well-known voice, she moans ;
and oft re-seeks, Urged by a mother's love, the accustomed stall.
Nor shade for her, nor dew-distended glebe, Nor stream soft gliding down its banks abrupt, Yields aught of solace;
nor the carking care Averts, that preys within;
nor the gay young
Of others soothe her o'er the joyous green :
So deep she longs, so lingers for her own.
Thus equal known, thus longed for, seek, in turn, The tender heifer, tremulous of voice, And the gay bleating lamb, their horned dams, Lured by the milky fount that nurtures life.
The corn, moreo'er, the yellow harvest yields, Matures not all alike;
—e'en the same kind In size oft varying to the curious eye.
Thus vary, too, th' enamelled shells, that paint
The bending shore;
whose thirsty sands drink deep
The main's soft waves, redundant rolled along.
Hence doubly flows it why the seeds of things, Compact by nature, by mechanic art Shaped not to one fixt model, each from each Should differ oft in figure through the void.
Illumined thus, the mind with ease decides
Why heaven's electric flash a subtler power Boasts, than the flame by torches fed below:
That formed than this of atoms finer far, Triumphant piercing many a pore minute
By the dull taper's blaze essayed in vain.
Light, the clear glass pervades, while lymph recoils
Whence springs the difference, but that subtler seeds
Rear the bright sun-beam than the fountain form ?
Free through the strainer flows the sparkling wine, While the slow oil hangs heavy :
in its course Checked, or by atoms of a grosser frame, Or more perplexed, and tangled ;
each from each Hence severing tardy, and, with toil extreme, Transuding separate through th' attenuate lawn.
Thus vary tastes:
and while the dulcet draught
Of milk or honey charms the enchanted lip, The wormwood straight convulses, by the tongue Abhorred, and writhing every sapid nerve.
Hence may'st thou learn those seeds that rouse, combined, A joyous flavour, round exist, and smooth;
While those that form the bitter, and austere, Are hook'd, or jagged, and their path propel Alone by wounding, hostile to the sense.
Thus all things live ;
from primal atoms reared
Of shape diverse, as deep within they ope Some secret source of pleasure or of pain.
So deem not thou the saw's discordant scream, Horrid, and harsh, flows from the same smooth seeds
That wake the strain mellifluous, when the fair, With flying fingers, sweeps th' accordant lyre.
Nor deem those atoms like, from putrid scenes
That spring malignant, and the essential sweets Breathed from CILICIAN saffron, or the blaze
Of fragrant altars fed from orient groves.
Nor canst thou form from the same source those hues,
On which the vision feeds with fond delight, And those abhorred, and hideous, or the germs Pungent and keen, that rouse the sight to tears.
'Twere vain t' attempt:
for all the soul that wakes To various pleasure, boasts a base rotund;
While pain but springs from atoms hook'd and harsh.
Yet seeds there are between ;
not smooth complete, Nor deeply jagged, but with angles shaped Just peeping o'er the surface.
These the nerves Pain not, but titillate;
a sense perceived
When sweets with bitters, sours with sweets combine, As oft in sauces, catered to the taste From the pale inula, or grape's soft grounds.
But fires and frosts spring different;
from a base Unlike indented, though indented each.
This if thou doubt, the TOUCH shall quick decide.
For TOUCH, 0 TOUCH !
ye powers of heaven supreme!
TOUCH forms the genuine sense whence chief we trace
Whatever without insinuates, or within Springs up innate, injurious in th* escape, Or, like the genidi tide by Venus roused, Pregnant with pleasure;
or, perchance, the frame Affecting inly, as th' essential seeds Collect tumultuous, urged to civil strife.
A feeling, this, full oft educed amain
Whene'er the uplifted palm, from sport or ire, Lets fall its vengeance o'er the reddening cheek.
Hence, from effects so various, various too Must be the forms to primal seeds assigned..
There are, moreover, that hard exist, and dense;
From atoms, these, more crook'd and clinging spring, Like tangled branches intertwined throughout.
Such, mid the foremost, shines the diamond's blaze, Fearless of insult, such the valid flint, The steel's enduring vigour, and the brass Discordant creaking from the public gates.
While those, reversed, a fluent power that boast Swell into birth from seeds rotund, and smooth, Unlinked th' essential globules, and with ease Poured headlong down, dissevering as they fall.
Those, too, that quick fly off, as clouds or smoke, Or lambent flame, if not from seeds educed Rotund, and polished, doubtless, in their make Nought know perplext, or hook'd, since armed with power To pierce the Parian marble, nor to view Cohering equal, like th* embracing brier:
Not jagged, but pointed, hence, the base they own.
Nor wondrous this;
that things of fluent frame
As the broad ocean, oft should strike the sense With taste unlovely;
for, though round and smooth
The genial atoms whence all fluids flow, Still, seeds discordant oft will intermix, Rough, though globose, and by the tongue abhorred, Though fitted still the fluent mass to form.
This to confirm, to prove with polished seeds Seeds harsh full oft combine, whence springs alone
The main's disflavour—from the briny wave The nauseous mass subtract, and all is sweet.
Thus Nature acts :
through many a thirsty sand
The surge she filters, freshening in its course, Till freed, at length, from every acrid power, Tangled, and fixt behind, the dulcet lymph Resprings to view, a calm and lucid pool.
This proved, what follows, as a truth derived, But that the forms of seeds, though varying much, Ne'er vary endless;
not unfrequent, else, Full many a seed must boast a bulk immense:
For many a differing figure ne'er can lurk
In things minute.
Deem, then, primordial seeds
Three fancied parts comprise, or grant e'en more, Invert their order, .let the right be left, Depress the loftiest, the profound exalt,- Soon will the pigmy mass exhaust complete Its tiny change of figures:
would'st thou, then, Augment the variance, thou must add, perforce, New primal matter, hence augmented sole.
Thus from fresh forms increase of size must flow Perpetual;
nor the seeds of things in shape Can differ endless, or e'en once evince A bulk immense, as erst the Muse has proved.
Already else the purple woof superb Of MELIBŒA, robbing for its dye The SYRIAN coasts,-already, dropt with gold, The peacock's laughing plumage else had sunk By gaudier hues overpowered.
The balmy myrrh, The luscious honey never more had urged A boast unrivalled;
e'en the swan's soft dirge Had ceased, and PHŒBUS dropt his liquid lyre:
All things o'er all prevailing undefined.
Thus those by sense abhorred, as these beloved, To more abhorred would yield;
each still o'er each, In sight or sound, in taste or smell diverse More hateful reared, more hideous, and obscene.
But since such powers exist not, since a bound
Is stampt on all things, we must own, convinced, That primal seeds in shape are bounded too,From frost to fire, from fire to winter's frost, All, all has limits:
heat and cold intense Th' extremes creating;
while progressive warmth Fills up, between, the modulated scale.
Thus each degree, though varying, varies not For ever, by extremes adverse confined, Combustion here, and there the polar ice.
But mark this truth, a truth connected close, That all primordial seeds, of shape alike, Alike are endless;
for though few the forms
Those seeds admit, yet finite were themselves Th' ENTIRE of things, a doctrine erst disproved, Were finite too, by bounds surmountless chained.
Come, then, while thus, in short, but sweetest verse, We prove them infinite;
prove hence alone
The world's vast fabric lives, cemented strong
By blows re-active unremitted urged.
Few are the forms the casual sight surveys
Of brutes exotic ;
and, with us, but small
Their unprolific power:
yet foreign climes, And realms far distant, view each class complete, Boundless in number.
Thus, though seldom here
Heaves the huge elephant his ponderous limbs, Prince of the savage tribes ;
yet myriads guard, As with an ivory mound, all INDIA'S sons;
A mound no power can pierce.
Such the vast stores
That Nature boasts in orders deemed most rare.
Yet could Creation's utmost scope produce A form unparalleled by all that breathes, Alone and individual,-were the base Not infinite whence first the monster sprang, How sprang he then at all ?
nor birth were his,
Nor e'en, though born, the power to nurture life.
But grant the primal atoms whence alone Such individual springs, were finite found, How, when, and where, by what concerted plan, What power innate, could e'er those atoms meet, Through ocean, scattered of ungenial seeds ?
These time could never join.
As when the main, Worked into fury, many a mighty ship Wrecks ruthless, and towards every coast impels Masts, yards, and streamers, cordage, sails, and helms, And planks disparted, teaching as they float
What dangers lurk unseen;
what snares to lure Unthinking mortals;
—and forewarning loud To fly the smooth temptation, nor e'en once Trust the false waves, though decked in loudest laugh:
So, should'st thou make the primal seeds of aught Once finite, instant the tumultuous war Of adverse atoms, through the boundless void Drives them far distant-never more to meet, Or met, cohere, or e'en, cohering, grow;
Facts without which Creation's self would fail, As all must thus proceed, augment, mature.
And hence the primal seeds of all that live Must, too, be boundless, whence each want is fed.
Nor can the mortal motions that wear out
The varied forms of things, with utter doom, Prevail for ever:
nor e'en those, reversed, Of genial power, that quicken into life, Can, through perpetual time, that life sustain.
Thus war eternal, midst the seeds of things, With equal triumph reigns;
now here, now there, The vital powers overcoming, and overcome.
The sigh funereal mingles with the bleat
Of babes just bursting to the light of heaven ;
Nor night o'er day, nor morn o'er night prevails, But marks the discord—INFANCY'S shrill cry Mixt with sick moans, the apparitors of DEATH.
This too, attentive, treasure in thy mind:
That nought the sight surveys, the soul conceives, Flows from one class of primal seeds alone.
Whatever exists is compound;
and the more
The latent powers, the energies it boasts, The more complex its nature;
reared to life From seeds more various, and of various shape.
First EARTH herself th' essential atoms holds
Of streams and fountains, whence the main renews;
Holds in herself the secret seeds of fires, Oft the brown heath wide-parching, unperceived, And oft, like Ætna, blazing to the day:
And holds each embryon, whence, to glad mankind, Springs the gay corn, the blossomed fruit-tree springs, Or whence the brutal tribes that roam at large Draw their green banquets, and possess their shades.
Hence mighty MOTHER OF TH' IMMORTAL GODS, Of brutes, and men, is EARTH full frequent feigned.
Her the sage bards of GREECE, in ancient song, Paint drawn by lions in a car sublime:
Hence, teaching how, in ether poised, she hangs, Unpropt by aught beneath;
the savage beasts
They yoked and reined, to demonstrate how sure
The wildest young a mother's cares may tame;
And, with a mural crown her brows they bound, Since with her towers she guards man's civic rights.
Thus deckt, tremendous, round from realm to realm, Still moves the solemn pomp, by all adored.
Her many a state, from holiest legends, call Parent of IDA;
and with PHRYGIAN nymphs Surround, her fair attendants ;
PHRYGIAN termed, Since these the climes where first, as fame reports, The field was cultured, and the harvest rose.
Her priests are eunuchs—emblem this devised To teach that sons rebellious to their sires, Or those the sacred fame that dare traduce
Of her who bore them, never shall themselves, Worthless and vile, by gods and men abhorred, Boast aught of babe to glad their longing sight.
With vigorous band the clamorous drum they rouse
And wake the sounding cymbal:
the hoarse horn Pours forth its threatening music, and the pipe With PHRYGIAN airs distracts the maddening mind, While arms of blood the fierce enthusiasts wield
To fright th* unrighteous crowds, and bend profound
Their impious souls before the power divine.
Thus moves the pompous idol through the streets, Scattering mute blessings, while the throngs devout Strew, in return, their silver and their brass, Loading the paths with presents, and o'ershade
The heavenly form, and all th' attending train With dulcet sprays of roses, pluckt profuse.
A band select before them, by the GREEKS CURETES called, from PHRYGIAN parents sprung, Sport with fantastic chains, the measured dance Weaving infuriate, charmed with human blood, And madly shaking their tremendous crests.
These picture, haply, the DICTÆAN train, Alike CURETES termed, as fame reports, Who drowned the infant cries of JOVE in CRETE, When round the boy divine, in arms they danced, Boys still themselves, and beat to measured sounds
Their clashing shields, lest SATURN the shrill shriek Should trace, and RHÆA shed eternal tears.
Thus these the matron-goddess now precede:
Or else, perchance, they paint how every breast
Should burn with patriot fire, and every arm Prove the firm guardian of a parent's years.
All these, though pageants well-devised, and bold, Will wander still from philosophic fact.
For, far from mortals, and their vain concerns,
In peace perpetual dwell th' immortal gods:
Each self-dependent, and from human wants Estranged for ever.
There no pain pervades, Nor dangers threaten ;
every passion sleeps, Vice no revenge, and virtue draws no boon.
Meantime the earth sensation never knows;
But, blest with the rude principles of things, In various mode hence various forms she rears.
Call, if thou choose it, the resounding deep NEPTUNE, and CERES term the golden grain;
Be BACCHUS wine, its vulgar source forgot, And e'en this mass of senseless earth define Parent of gods;
no harm ensues,—but mark, 'Tis fiction all, by vital facts disproved.
Thus varies earth in product;
and, alike
In primal seeds, thus varies all she bears.
The steed, the steer, the fleecy flock that range Beneath the same pure sky, from the same fount
Their thirst that quench, and o'er the flowery lawn Crop the same herbage, differ still, through time, In form generic;
each parental stamp Retaining close, from sire to sire propelled.
Such the vast variance of primordial seeds;
Through every herb, through every fountain such.
Each form, moreover, of animated life Compounded, flows from muscle, bone, and nerve, Vein, heat, and moisture ;
yet e'en these comprise Full many an atom, each, of shape unlike.
Thus fire itself is complex ;
for if nought Deep blend besides, the germs, at least, combine Of heat, smoke, ashes, and translucent light:
And reasoning thus, thy vigorous mind may deem Still powers beyond lurk deeper, though unknown.
Of the same substance, as the fragrant gums Burnt o'er the altar to th' offended gods, Emits both taste and odour, hence from seeds Educed, of various figures ;
odours oft Piercing the nerves that tastes essay in vain, And tastes where odours fail:
facts that evince
Their forms diverse;
and prove that seeds unlike Rear the mixt mass diffused through all that lives.
-Mark but these fluent numbers ;
many a type
To many a term is common ;
but the terms,
The numbers culled, as differing these from those, From different types evolve:
not so diverse
That the same type recurs not through the whole, Or that, recurring, it recurs alone From types too bounded ;
but from types alike Free to each term, yet ever new combined, Flows the vast change, th' harmonious system flows.
Thus, through the world, the primal seeds of all, To all things common, re-arranged diverse, In myriad forms shoot forth ;
and herbs, and men, And trees umbrageous own the same fixt source.
Yet not in endless modes combine the seeds
Of things at random ;
many a monster else
Would start tremendous, the fair frame of man Sprout forth half formed, and trunks of trees have souls.
Shapes then would swarm half earthly, half marine, And Nature's all-prolific womb propel, With breath of fire, Chimæras;
things the sight Meets never, since from seeds, and powers precise, All spring to life, and thus preserve their kinds.
Then all must spring, since all, from every food, To every tribe adapted, straight digests;
And, blending with each limb, the train renews
Of acts appropriate ;
while th' ungenial mass Meets earth unchanged;
or if, perchance, absorbed, Flies off impalpable through pores extreme, Void of all union, and for life unfit.
Nor deem each animated tribe alone Such laws avows-all nature feels their force.
For since the difference 'twixt created things
Is total, their primordial seeds in form M ust differ too:
not that they ne'er commix
Of equal shape, but e'en when mixt that still, From re-arrangement, the result is changed.
Nor only in their forms thus vary seeds Primordial;
but, alike, in weight, and power, In concourse, motion, intervening space, And close connexion ;
changes that define, Not men and brutes alone, but bound secure From ocean earth, and earth from heaven sublime.
But haste we, many a truth lies yet unsung Culled from my own loved labours.
Deem not thou,
When aught of substance black or white the view Solicits obvious,-deem not, in the germs
Of embryon matter, black or white inheres, Or aught besides of tint, where aught occurs, Rousing the vision ;
since the seeds of things Live void of colours actual or conceived.
This should'st thou doubt, contending nought exists
Through the wide world but must evince some hue, The doubt flows groundless.
He, whose sightless orb Ne'er drank the day enlightened, still perceives Whate'er exists, though tints elude his ken.
Hence not essential colours to the form
Of things created:
frequent e'en ourselves, Mid the deep shade of night, by touch alone Prove what surrounds us, every hue extinct.
All hues, moreo'er, to all by turns convert;
A change primordial seeds can ne'er sustain;
Since something still through nature must exist
All change defying, lest th' ENTIRE surveyed Fall into nought;
for that which once admits Mutation dies, its pristine powers destroyed.-
Tinge, then, with caution, the prime seeds of things, Lest, hence, thou ope the doors of death to all.
But though material atoms thus live void
Of hue;
still many a differing form is theirs, Whence hues they gender, and their variance stamp.
Much, then, import th' arrangement, and the powers, The kinds, connexions of primordial seeds, Positions, impulse, and effects impelled;
Since, hence, with ease the mind may, instant, trace Why what is black this moment, should, the next, Pour o'er the view with alabaster dye.
Thus, when loud tempests tear the tortured main, The dashing surge is robed in dazzling white, This may'st thou fathom hence, and prove precise
Why, oft though black, from combinations new Of its primordial atoms, added these, And those withdrawn, oft, too, the deep should wear A vest contrasted, whitening to the day.
But were its primal atoms tinged themselves Black, or but blue, concussion ne'er could change
The fixt result;
nor turn the black or blue
To the pure polish of the marble bust.
Nor urge from seeds of varying tints, perchance, Springs, when combined, the main's resplendent face ;
As in the cube mechanic many a shape Diverse unites to rear its frame complete.
For as the keen sight in the cube surveys
Those varying figures, so the splendid deep, Or aught of equal lustre, would evince
The varying tinctures whence that lustre flows.
The differing forms, moreover, the cube contains Mar not its unity, but differing hues A blended tinge create, by each diverged.
A cause like this, too, all effect destroys ;
Since white or black springs not from seeds so dyed, But seeds commixt of various dyes possest.
Though, doubtless, white flows rather from the want
Of each existent tincture, than from seeds With black, in part, imbued, or aught besides Of equal contrast, and as firm a foe.
And, since all colours live but in the light, Were hues essential to the seeds of things
These, too, would die in darkness :
for, resolve
What hues exist beneath the midnight gloom ?
Hues born of sun-beams, changing but their s!
adcs
As, playful, changes the refracted ray?
Thus the gay pigeon, as his plumes he waves, Drinks in new tinctures from the noon-tide blaze:
Now glows the ruby, and now, tinged with blue, Sports the green emerald o'er his glossy neck.
Thus, too, the peacock, as direct, or bent Falls the full beam, wears each prismatic dye.
Since, then, th' impinging light each hue creates, So, without light, each, instant, must expire.
And as the stimulus the sight that strikes Varies, from things that varying dyes educe, Black, white, or aught besides, and nought imports, Change how it may, th' existing hue, but sole
The different figures whence those hues are reared:
Hence useless colours to the seeds of things, From varying forms by varying frictions roused.
Since, too, no seeds defined with tints are stained Defined alike, and every shape concurs
In all that springs, whatever the hue evinced, Whence flows it, then, that every class alike Reflects not every tincture ?-whence that crows
Robe not in white from seeds that white create ?
Or that the downy swan, in black arrayed, Or hues as hideous, ne'er the sight appals ?
As things, moreover, to parts minute divide, Th' anterior tincture fades.
Thus fades away, To dust impalpable reduced, the dye Of gold refulgent:
thus the TYRIAN woof, Frittered to threads, its purple pride foregoes;
Hence proving clear that hues from things concrete Evanish total ere to seeds dissolved.
From many a substance sound, or odour fine, Flies never;
nor the race of man bestows Odours, or sounds on all things.
Judge then, hence,
That, since not all things the keen sight discerns, Full many a substance, too, as void exists
Of varying hues, as these of scent, or sound:
Things, than which nought the mind more clear perceives, Whate'er the powers possest of, or denied.
Nor deem primordial seeds devoid alone Of hues prismatic.
Heat, and cold severe, Moisture, and sound, these, too, they never know;
Nor aught of fluent odours, to the sense Hateful or sweet.
Thus when, to please the fair, Some rich perfume the skilful artist plans, Drawn from the fragrant nard, the dulcet powers
Of marjoram, and myrrh, with studious heed From the pure olive first a juice he seeks
Void of all scent, for nature such prepares, Lest, with th' effluvia thus selected choice, Aught else combine, and mar th' harmonious whole.
Thus void of scent primordial seeds must spring, Thus void of sound;
and hence nor scent, nor sound, Can give to things created:
for themselves Nought can transmit but what themselves possess.
And hence, moreover, the powers of heat, or cold, Vapour, or taste, these never can bestow, Nor aught alike destructive, aught surveyed, Viscous, unfirm, or fragile;
aught educed From bodies soft, putrescent, or relaxed;
These thou must sever from primordial seeds
If things created on a base be built Immortal, whence the world's vast fabric lives, And nought to nought can waste with utter death.
This full premised, now, MEMMIUS, mark what flows;
That all the sentient forms the sight surveys, Whatever their powers, from senseless atoms spring.
This every fact of every day, if scanned, Far from resisting, proves a truth most firm;
That sentient things, things void of sense create.
Thus into life th' insensate dunghill rears
The race of worms, when once the mingling shower Wakes the warm ferment through the putrid mass, Thus all things change to all things ;
foliage, fruits, And the gay glebe to flocks, and herds convert;
And flocks, and herds to man ;
and man, in turn, Feeds the foul strength of birds, and barbarous beasts.
From every food, thus Nature s chemic power Builds up the forms of life ;
in every class
Thus wakes the senses every class avows ;
As through the winter-stack full oft she spreads
The rushing blaze, and turns the whole to fire.-
Seest thou not hence, then, of what vast concern
The modes in which primordial seeds combine, Act, or re-act, give motion, or accept ?
This creed what hinders ?
what perverts thy mind,
And locks thy senses from a truth so plain
That sentient things from things insensate flow ?
What but that stocks, and stones, and earth's dull clod, Boast no sensation though alike educed ?—
Yet mark, attentive, the sage muse ne'er yet Has urged that all things doubtless must alike Spring forth percipient, and with sense endued:
But that of vast concern, as hence alone, Sensation ceaseless flows—the modes diverse
Of motion, order, form, with which, through time, Primordial atoms blend:
-modes the dull clod Knows not, its frame unorganized and rude.
Though the dull clod, or sapless root as dull, When the moist shower the putrid strife has roused, Themselves the vermin race in crowds create:
Changed, then, their nature, from arrangements new, And full empowered perceptive life to rear.
Those, too, who hold that sentient forms throughout Spring but from sentient seeds, those seeds must deem Soft and unsolid, since unsolid all, And soft each region, where sensation reigns, Th' interior bowels, and the flesh without;
And hence such seeds must doubtless waste to nought.
Yet grant their dates eternal:
such must then The total sense possess of things they rear, Or sense of separate parts :
but parts alone Have no perception, nor alone can live.
Each leans on each ;
the loose dismembered hand Drops powerless;
nor can aught itself sustain, From the full form, the total sense that flows.
What then remains but that each seed exists
An animal complete, endowed throughout With vital functions ?
but resolve, how then Prove they the immortal principles of things ?
Whence draw the power, possest by nought that breather, To live through time, and brave the attacks of fate?
But grant e'en this:
their combination still
No forms could rear, but those of sentient life;
Nor men, nor herds, nor savage beasts produce Aught but themselves;
the sense generic shown Varying as varies the generic frame.
Nor urge that sentient seeds, at times, perchance, Lose all sensation, and insensate live;
Why with an attribute so soon destroyed Robe them at all then ?
Rather, mark how soon
The insensate yolk incipient life betrays, And springs a vital chick:
mark, as the muse Has earlier sung, how from the warm ferment
Of earths putrescent, by the clouds bedewed, The vermin nations rise, with soul replete, Thus spreading sense where sense was none before.
Nor deem sensation senseless seeds create Sole from some change anterior, long educed Ere into birth the sentient being springs.
What more fallacious ?
since nor birth complete
Nor aught of change can Nature's self create
But from the sympathy of primal seeds:
Nor, till the frame percipient be combined, Can e'er perception flow ;
since wide through space, In earth, in air, in streams, and lambent fire, Are spread the rude materials, unarranged, And void of social bond, whence first exists Each vital motion, whence each guardian sense Springs, and the complicated frame protects.
When too, abrupt, falls some tremendous blow, Throughout the system suffers, every sense
Of soul and body discomposed alike.
Then fails the arrangement of primordial seeds, Each vital action fails ;
and, shook severe
Through every limb, the principles of life Dissolve each fond connexion, quit their post, And through th' external pores
By off at large.
For what but this can force extreme effect ?
The dread solution, and the death of all.
But oft, when less the violence displayed, The vital motions left may triumph still, And quell the mighty tumult, end recall, From the rude grasp of fate, each active power Marshalled anew, and every sense relume.
For else, why rather should those powers retreat Back from destruction with recruited strength, Than still proceed, and burst the bars of life ?
As pain, too, springs when, midst th' interior frame, Or limbs extreme, by sudden force convulsed Each vital atom shakes through all its course, But yields to pleasure when the shock subsides,- Since primal seeds can ne'er such shock sustain,- No pain they know, nor e'er the fruit can pluck
Of dear delight;
hence nought of sense is theirs.
But if, that things sensation may possess, Their seeds primordial must possess the same,- Say, from what seeds, then, springs the race of man ?
From those, forsooth, incited quick to laugh, Those down whose cheeks perpetual tears distil, And those deep-versed in causes and effects, Discussing grave the seeds that rear themselves.
For grant this system, and whate'er exists
Must spring from seeds minuter, endless urged, And draw, progressive, every power displayed Of thought, or laughter, from the parent stock.
This if thou smile at, and contend that things
With power endowed of laughter, speech, and thought Still rise from seeds that no such powers avow, Why not concede, then, sentient things alike May flow from seeds of total sense devoid ?
All spring from heaven, ethereal, all that live:
The sire of all is ETHER:
he, full oft, In dulcet drops descends of genial rain And the bland EARTH impregnates.
Timely, then, Rises the glossy blade, the joyous leaf Shoots forth, and man and beast, in countless tribes, Fed from the various banquet of the fields, Live their gay hours, and propagate their kinds.
Maternal, hence, is EARTH most justly named.
Thus all things rise, thus all again return:
Earth takes what earth bestowed;
and back to heaven Remount the ethereal dews from heaven that felL
Yet death destroys not the prime seeds of things,
But scatters only ;
atoms hence commix With stranger atoms, every form commutes, And every tint;
perception springs amain, And, instantaneous, wastes again to nought.
Of such vast moment are the modes diverse
In which primordial seeds their posts arrange, Act, and re-act, give motion, and accept:
For deem not seeds thus floating most minute Through the vast whole, now obvious to the view, Now quick disperst, can ne'er eternal live.
Such then the moment, as already urged, With which the types, these numbers that compose, Change their positions, and retreat, or blend.
Thus the same letters, or with variance small, Heaven, earth, and water, seas, and suns express, Fruits, plants, and mortals ;
common are the types, The terms but change from combinations new.
Thus change material things:
their primal seeds
In site, connexion, interval of space, Position, motion, weight, attractive power, In these as varying, varies the result.
Now bend thy mind to truths profounder still:
For stranger doctrines must assault thine ear, And a new scene of wonders yet unfold.
Whate'er is new, though obvious and defined, Gains not an easy credence ;
but when once Flies the fresh novelty, th' unsteady soul Yields its full faith to facts mysterious most.
The vault of heaven cerulean, spangled thick With stars, and with th'effulsive lustre cheered Of sun and moon refulgent-were at once
This scene celestial o'er the race of man To burst abrupt-how would the nations start!
What wonders, then, be traced !
with what vast toil Would e'en the sage the prospect preconceive!
Yet now, full sated with the scene sublime, Man scarce lifts up his listless eyes to heaven.
Cease, then, alarmed by aught profound, or strange, Right reason to reject;
weigh well the proofs Each scheme advances;
if by truth upheld Embrace the doctrine ;
but, if false, abjure.
Urged thus, by truth,-beyond the world's wide walls
Since space spreads boundless, the redundant mind, Free in its flights, pants, ardent, to discern
What fills those realms where sight can never soar.
And first, th' ENTIRE OF THINGS, above, below, Search where thou wilt on every side alike Spreads unconfined:
this, as already taught, Right reason proves, and many a clamorous fact.
Then deem not thou, since thus perpetual space Flows infinite, and infinite the seeds
That, from exhaustless founts, in endless modes
Fly through the void, by endless motions urged, Deem not this visual system of the heavens Alone exists, unparalleled by aught, And that all matter elsewhere sleeps supine.
Since too of its own nature the vast mass Sprang forth spontaneous, rousing every power
To every mode of motion, rashly oft, Oft vain and fruitless, till, at length, it formed Th' unchanging rudiments of things sublime, And heaven, and earth, and main, and mortals rose:
-
Hence doubly flows it, other systems still, Like ours, must deck the vast ethereal void, Enfolded in its avaricious grasp.
Ample, moreover, the matter thus required, The place at hand, the cause efficient full, Whence new creations may for ever spring.
Since, then, so boundless the great mass of seeds
That endless ages ne'er could cast th' amount,- Since the same power presides, the nature still
That reared this visual system, and alike
Those seeds can mould to systems such as ours-
The fact flows doubtless, mid the void immense, That other worlds in other parts must rise, Peopled with reasoning, and with brutal tribes.
Add, too, that nought, through universal space, Springs single, the sole progeny produced, The sole sustained;
still countless every class, Those, chief, percipient:
the wild mountain herds, The race of man consociate, the mute fish With Quivering fin, and all th* aerial tribes.
Hence, too, nor heaven, nor earth, nor sun, nor moon.
Nor the broad main, nor aught besides, alone Can live, but each unlimited in kind.
Each the same substance, the same seeds of death, Bears in its frame, that stamp the ranks diverse More obvious, gendered by connubial love.
These truths avowed, all Nature shines at once, Free in her acts, no tyrant to control, Self-potent, and uninfluenced by the gods.
For, 0 ye powers divine!
whose tranquil lives
Flow free from care, with ceaseless sunshine blest,- Who the vast whole could guide, midst all your ranks ?
Who grasp the reins that curb th' ENTIRE OF THINGS ?
Turn the broad heavens, and pour, through countless worlds, Th' ethereal fire that feeds their vital throngs ?
Felt every moment, felt in every place.
Who form the louring clouds ?
the lightning dart,
And roll the clamorous thunder, oft in twain Rending the concave ?-or, full deep retired, Who point, in secret, the mysterious shaft That, while the guilty triumphs, prostrates stern
The fairest forms of innocence and worth ?
Long after the wide world had risen, the sun Shot his young beams, and earth and sea rejoiced
In infant being-still primordial seeds, From the vast compass of th' ENTIRE, conjoined;
Conjoined from every part;
hence earth and main Increased;
hence the broad mansions of the heavens Spread wider;
and th' ethereal dome was filled With new-born air;
for all, harmonious, blend Kinds with their kinds, and thence those kinds augment.
Earth from the seeds of earth, from fiery, fire, Air from aerial, from the dewy, dew:
Till all-prolific Nature rears at length To full perfection the vast frame of things,
And the gorged system can no more absorb
Than what flies casual from th' external pores.
Then boasts the whole completion;
Nature, then, Restrains all progress, every power matured.
For all with gradual growth that swells, and thus Climbs, by degrees, the scale of life adult, Far less emits than what its frame receives.
Wide through the system flows the genial food Towards every part disperst:
yet not so wide
That much transudes external, and the day
Thus loses larger than the day digests.
For still, though much evanish, ampler still
The nutriment that spreads, till the full form Gains, by degrees, its point of perfect power.-
Then back, by gradual march, its strength declines, Its fond perfection, and, from day to day, Melts all its vigour.-
This the ceaseless course
Of things created.
But those chief, with speed, Waste into nought that boast a bulk immense;
Since wider, here, the surface whence, each hour, Flies off the light effluvium, nor with ease Winds the fresh food through all the mighty mass, By ceaseless strife exhausted, and a store Asking far ampler than the store received.
Thus all must perish, unsupplied within, And, from without, by blows tumultuous urged;
Blows that, resistless, from whatever adjoins, Ply their full vigour till the victim yields.
Thus shall the world's wide walls hereafter sink
In boundless ruins:
thus, though yet sustained By food appropriate, and preserved entire.
For not for ever will her powers digest
The due recruit, nor Nature's hand supply.
-E'en now her glory fades, and the faint earth, That erst upreared such giant forms of life
In every class profuse,-scarce now protrudes, With utmost toil, a scant and puny race.
For deem not thou some golden chain from heaven Each tribe conducted down to realms below;
Nor from the boisterous billows of the main
That mortals sprung:
Earth from herself produced
The various ranks that still herself sustains.
Then, too, spontaneous, from the soil she reared
Those luscious fruits, those vines that gladden life;
And crowned with pasture, and with glossy corn, Those fields where man now toils almost in Vain:
Where faints the steer, the ploughman faints fatigued, And the keen share so wastes, mechanic art Can scarce supply th' exhaustion:
—such the call For labour now, so foods forbear to rise.
Thus musing, the rude husbandman shakes oft
His weary head ;
his thriftless pains bewails, Thriftless too sure:
and, while his wandering thought Weighs, with the present, the fair times elapsed, Envies the lot the men of yore enjoyed.
Then, luckless planter of degenerate vines!
His day he curses, then all heaven he tires, Muttering that earlier times, though virtuous more, Should, thus, have more been favoured,-thus have reared An ampler harvest e'en from narrower farms,- Heedless that all things by degrees must fail, Worn out by age, and doomed to certain death.
O GLORY of the Greeks !
who first didst chase
The mind's dread darkness with celestial day, The worth illustrating of human life-
Thee, glad, I follow-with firm foot resolved To tread the path imprinted by thy steps;
Not urged by competition, but, alone, Studious thy toils to copy;
for, in powers, How can the swallow with the swan contend ?
Or the young kid, all tremulous of limb, Strive with the strength, the fleetness of the horse;
Thou, sire of science!
with paternal truths
Thy sons enrichest:
from thy peerless page, Illustrious chief!
as from the flowery field
Th' industrious bee culls honey, we alike Cull many a golden precept-golden each-
And each most worthy everlasting life.
For as the doctrines of thy godlike mind Prove into birth how nature first uprose, All terrors vanish;
the blue walls of heaven Fly instant-and the boundless void throughout Teems with created things.
Then too we trace
The powers immortal, and their blest abodes;
Scenes where the winds rage never-unobscured By clouds, or snow white drifting,-and o'erspread With laughing ether, and perennial day.
There nature fills each want, nor aught up-springs
To mar th' eternal harmony of soul.-
Yet nought exists of hell's infernal reign:
Nor hides the solid earth the scenes from sight Spread through the void beneath.
-On these vast themes
As deep I ponder, a sublime delight, A sacred horror sways me—Nature thus By thy keen skill through all her depths unveiled.
Since, then, we erst have sung the make minute
Of primal seeds ;
how, in spontaneous course Re-active urged, their various figures fly, And, hence, how all things into life ascend, Next let our daring verse the frame unfold
Of soul, and reasoning mind ;
-and chase, far chase
Those fears of future torment that distract Man's total being;
with the gloom of death Tinge all things;
nor e'en suffer once the tide
Of present joy to flow serene and pure.
For though, full oft, men boast they far prefer Death to disease, or infamy of name, is Assert they know the soul but springs from blood, Or, if the humour urge them, is but air, And hence, that useless all the lore we bring:
-
Oft flows the boast from love of praise alone.
For when of home debarred, from every haunt
Of man cut off, with conscious guilt overpowered, Midst every ill such boasters still survive:
Still fell new victims, and th' infernal powers Implore with black oblations;
through their breast Religion thus with ten-fold force propelled.
Through doubtful dangers, hence, through straits Severa Pursue the race of man;
then sole ascends Truth from the lowliest bosom, then alone Flies all profession, and the fact unfolds.
E'en restless avarice, and love of fame, So oft to deeds unrighteous that seduce, And spread the growing guilt from man to maiL
By ceaseless toil urged on, and night and day, Striving the crowd t' o'ertop—these pests of life Draw half their vigour from the dread of death.
For infamy, contempt, and want severe, These chief embitter mortals;
these, they deem, Death's foremost train ;
and, studious these to shun, Far off they fly, still wand'ring from the right, Urged on by fear, and kindle civil broils, And murder heap on murder, doubling thus, Ceaseless, their stores insatiate:
raptured high When breathes a brother his last, languid groan ;
And with mistrust, through every nerve alarmed, Joining the feast some jovial kinsman forms.
From the same source, the same deep dread of death.
Springs ENVY poisoning all things:
mortals, hence, Lament to power that this, to glory that, Crowned with the people's plaudits should ascend, While all unnoticed, mid the crowd obscure Themselves still jostle;
pining every hour, For names, for statues;
and, full oft, so strong From dread of death, hate they the light of heaven, That, sick at heart, through their own breast they plunge
The fatal steel:
heedless that this alone, This pungent dread, engenders all their cares, Nips the keen sense of shame-turns friends to foes, And bursts the bonds that harmonize the heart.
For, goaded hence, hell ever in his sight, Man oft betrays his country;
and, for gold, Yields up the reverend form that gave him birth.
For as the boy, when midnight veils the skies, Trembles and starts at all things-so, full oft, E'en in the noon, men start at forms as void Of real danger as the phantoms false
By darkness conjured, and the schoolboy's dread.
A terror this the radiant darts of day Can ne'er disperse.
To truth's pure light alone, And wisdom yielding, intellectual suns.
First, then, the mind, the spirit named at times, That which controls, which measures sentient life, Forms of this mortal make a part as clear
As the keen eye, the finger, or the foot.
Here cleave we firm, though many a sage contends
The mental sense no part specific frames, But springs the vital product of the whole.
This the GREEK schools term HARMONY-A sense
Of living power while still th' essential soul No point appropriates-as corporeal health Flows not from sections, but the form entire.
Thus, deem they, springs the mind;
a tenet fraught, If right we judge, with error most absurd.
For oft th' external frame disease sustains, While all escapes within:
and thus, reversed, The mind oft sickens while the body thrives:
As, when the gout the tortured foot.
inflames,
The distant head still boasts its wonted ease.
When, too, sweet sleep o'er all the wearied limbs Spreads his soft mantle, and locks every sense, Still something stirs within us—something urged, E'en then, to various motions, and alive To joy's glad impulse, or fictitious fears.
Yet more;
to prove the soul a part exists Constituent of the body-to subvert
This fancied HARMONy-mark oft how life Mid the dread loss of many a limb endures;
While instant as the vital heat but ebbs,
The vital breath flies off—pulsation stops, And heart and limb all lifeless lie alike.
Hence may'st thou judge that not in every part Dwells the same portion of percipient power, Nor health from each flows equal;
but that those Chief nurture life, and check its flight abrupt, Reared from aerial seeds, or fluent heat.
As these exist, then, heat and vital air, Health through the members sickens or abounds.
This proved precise-that soul, that mind exists
Part of the body-let such sages still
Hold the term HARMONY—deduced, perchance, From the sweet chords of Helicon;
let such Still something mean, whatever that something be, No name of theirs expresses:
thou, meanwhile, Quitting such contests, mark what yet remains.
The soul, the mind, then, one same substance forms Minutely blended;
but, in vulgar phrase, That call we mind, or spirit, which pervades, As chief, the heart’s deep avenues, and rules The total frame.
Here grief, and terror spring, Here pleasure plays ;
and here we hence conceive Dwells mind, or spirit;
while the remnant soul, Through every limb diffused, the mind's dread nod Obeys, and yields submissive to its will.
Of its own powers, mind reasons and exults, While soul, like flesh, can never rouse alone.
As oft the head, or eye, some anguish keen Sustains, while yet the general frame escapes, So, in itself, the mind, full oft, endures Rapture or pain, while yet the soul at large, Spread through the members, nought of change perceives.
But when the mind some shock severe subdues,
The total soul then sympathizes:
then, Should deadly horror sway o'er all the frame Spreads the cold sweat, the livid paleness spreads, Clouds dim the sight, the palsied tongue is mute, Tingles the ear, and every limb dissolves.
Oft, too, from mental terror faints the frame:
Whence may'st thou mark how close the bond that knits
The soul and spirit;
this exciting that, And that, when roused, deep-rousing every nerve.
Hence prove we, too, that both alike exist Corporeal:
—hence, since every member yields With quick submission to the joint behest:
Since bursts from sleep the body, since the face Obsequious varies, and the total man Feels the full sway profound;
for nought can act
Where touch subsists not, nor can touch subsist Void of corporeal base :
-can we, then, doubt
That soul, that spirit must corporeal spring ?
In all, moreover, of ease or anguish keen
The body feels, the assenting mind partakes.
Thus, when some deadly dart through many a nerve, Mid many a bone, tremendous, winds its way Quick faints the spirit :
-a fond wish to die Now sways, and now the native love of life.
Material, hence, the mental frame must live, Since by material arms so soon assailed.
Now list attentive, while we next unfold Its make mysterious, and to sight educe.
First, then, we firm maintain the mind results
From seeds of matter, most minute and smooth.
This hence we prove, that nought so swiftly speeds
As what the mind determines and completes ;
The mind, whose keen rapidity o’erpowers
All that the sight marks instantaneous most.
But what thus rapid moves, from seeds must spring
Most exquisitely subtile, and rotund, Roused into action by minutest force.
Thus moves the fluent stream, urged on with ease, Since reared from atoms polished, and exile, While the tough honey, of compactor frame, More tardy flows, and ampler force demands.
For more tenacious here the total mass, From heavier seeds engendered, tenuous less, And less globose.
Thus zephyrs gentlest breath Wide scatters, oft, the seeds the poppy rears, Heaped in the sun-beam,—while the grosser mass
Of congregated stones, or missile darts Feels no impression.
Hence material things
Move brisk or sluggish, as from atoms reared Light and globose, or denser, and more rough.
Since then the mind, in every act, we trace Most voluble, from seeds of subtlest size, Rotund and light, its mystic make must spring:
A fact, 0 friend to truth!
thou oft shalt find
Of utmost moment in what yet remains.
Hence learn we, too, of what attenuate frame
The mind consists ;
and to what trivial space
Must shrink its texture if compacted close-
That, when in death the wearied body sleeps, And soul and spirit wander from their post, E'en then the sight no diminution marks
In weight or figure;
death usurping sole
The warm-breathed vapour, and the vital senae.
From seeds minutest, hence, the soul entire Must flow,—through all the frame profusely poured;
And, e'en when fled, still leaving every limb Its wonted weight, its figure most precise.
So, from the juice of BACCHUS, when flies off Its flower ethereal, from the light perfume
When mounts the essential spirit, or from man Th' excreted lymph exhales-the curious eye Nought marks diminished,-the same weight survives, Th' same fixt bulk, since from minutest seeds Springs the light scent, the ethereal spirit springs.
Hence doubly flows it why the mind's pure frame Must, too, be reared from seeds of subtlest size,- Hence, as its flight to visual change creates, But bulk alike, and substance still endure.
Yet not unmixt its nature :
the light gas Breathed from the dying, in its texture blends Heat, air, and vapour, ever each with each Compacted ;
vapour, in its ample pores, Absorbing heat, and heat ethereal air.
Triple the substance, hence, the soul that builds ;
Yet e'en the whole perception ne'er can form:
For nought in each subsists of power t' excite
Those sensile motions whence perception flows.
Hence some fourth substance, doubtless, must we deem, Conjoint existing ;
which, though void of name, Springs from minutest atoms, lightest most
And most attenuate;
deep-endowed with power Of fleetest speed, and hence, that first begets
Those sensile movements that the frame pervade.
This first begets, as formed from subtlest seeds, Next heat the incipient action, vapour next Partakes, and air posterior, till the soul Rouses throughout:
then flows the blood, then feels Each vital organ,-till, through every bone, E'en to its central marrow, winds, in turn, The sinuous rapture, or the sense of pain.
Yet pain, thus deep within, can never pierce
With keen corrosion, but the total man Shakes from his basis-life no more subsists, And the light soul through every pore flies off.
Hence less profound descends, in general ills, Th' excited action, and man still survives.
And here, in phrase appropriate, would we prove
In what firm bonds, what various modes, the make Of each with each commixes, but the dearth Of terms select restrains us;
yet attend
While thus our utmost efforts we essay.
Each primal substance, then, with each coheres
In every act so firm that nought conceived Can sever;
nought can central space admit;
But as the powers they live of one joint frame.
As the fresh victim blends in every limb Heat, taste, and odour, while the total builds
But one compacted mass, so here, alike, But one same nature flows from heat and air, And mystic vapour, and the power unnamed
That rears the incipient stimulus, and first Darts sentient motion through the quivering frame.
Far from all vision this profoundly lurks, Through the whole system's utmost depth diffused, And lives as soul of e'en the soul itself.
As with each limb the general spirit blends, Though ne'er discerned, so subtle and so few Its primal seeds-so, through the spirit, spreads
This form ineffable, this mystic power, Soul of the soul, and lord of mortal man.
Thus, too, commixt must vapour, heat, and air, Live through each limb united;
and, though oft Each rise o'er each triumphant, still uprear One frame harmonious, lest the power of air, Of heat, or vapour, each from each disjoined, Mar all sensation, and fly off dissolved.
Heat springs superior in the mind enraged, When burns the total system, and the eye Darts forth its lurid lightnings:
vapour chill
The ascendance gains when fear the frame pervades, And ruthless HORROR, shivering every limb;
While the pure air, of tranquillizing power, Smooths all the visage, and the soul serenes.
Heat sways, as urged already, in the form With acrid breast, that rouses soon to ire , Chief in the rampant lion, whose proud heart Bursts with impetuous roaring, nor can bound Th* infuriate tide that ceaseless raves within.
For ampler vapour mark the timid deer:
Quick spreads its chilling dew through every limb
In many a tremor quivering ;
while the ox Proves, through his placid life, a temper formed From air supreme.
Him ne'er the torch of ire Maddens abrupt in clouds and smoke involved, Nor shuddering fear transfixes;
but, remote, 'Twixt both he stands, and lifts his honest front, The trembling deer, the lion gaunt and grim.
Thus varies man:
though education trim Add its bland polish, frequent still we trace
The first deep print of nature on the soul, Nor aught can all-erase it:
ever, whence, This yields to sudden rage, to terror that, While oft a third beyond all right betrays A heart of mercy.
Thus, in various modes, The moral temper, and symphonious life Must differ;
thus from many a cause occult
The sage can ne'er resolve, nor human speech Find phrase t' explain ;
so boundless, so complex, The primal sources whence the variance flows!
Yet this the muse may dictate that so few The native traces wisdom ne'er can rase, Man still may emulate the gods in bliss.
Thus through each limb th' impressive spirit spreads, Lord of the body, the prime fount of health, Thus with each limb in league so close combines Nought void of death can sever them in twain.
As the clear frankincense its fond perfume Can ne'er desert till both together die, So, from the flesh, the spirit and the soul Part not till each one common fate dissolve.
So live they mutual, so, from earliest birth, In intertwined existence, that apart, Nor this nor that perception can possess, The joint result of each, by effort joint First kindled, and through all the frame diffused.
This frame, moreo'er, alone can never spring, Can never thrive, the dread attack of death Can never conquer.
For, with aim sublime, Though the light vapour from the tepid lymph
Fly off profuse, while yet the lymph itself Exists uninjured-the deserted limbs Not harmless, thus, can bear the soul's escape, Doomed to one ruin, and one common grave.
So, from their first crude birth, the vital acts
Of soul and body each solicits each With fond contagion, from the earliest hour The new-formed fetus quickens in the womb, No power can sever them devoid of death.-
Since life but flows, then, from the two combined, Combined alone their natures must subsist.
Hence those who hold the body never feels,
But sole the spirit through the body poured, Each vital fact oppose:
for how, resolve, Could man e'er deem the body crowned with sense
But from such facts instructed and confirmed ?
True-body feels not when the spirit flies, For sense from each springs mutual, and, in death, Not sense alone is lost, but much besides.
To deem the eyes, then, of themselves survey Nought in existence, while th' interior mind Looks at all nature through them as alone Through loop-holes, is to trifle—sight itself
The creed absurd opposing every hour.
For oft the eye-ball dares not meet the day, The flood of light overpowering:
but were eyes
The mind's mere loop-holes, toil were never theirs.
Then too, each portal the reflected beam Must more obstruct than usher ;
-and, removed, Th' exulting mind must drink a double day.
Nor be the sacred doctrine here advanced Urged by DEMOCRITUS, that soul extends Atom for atom, through the total frame, With grosser body:
for as less of size
The soul's primordial seeds than those that rear Th' organic structure, so in number too Yield they,-less freely through the limbs diffused.
Hence may'st thou rather deem the soul'is pure seeds Placed at such intervals as just suffice
To rouse alone when needful, through the frame, Percipient motions.
For full oft the dust Blown by the breeze, or fine fugacious chalk, Lights on the limbs unheeded:
so, at eve, The dews we feel not, nor the silky threads
By dexterous spider spun from spray to spray
That twine around us,—nor the tattered web From some old roof that on the hair descends, Nor the soft down of feathers, nor the gOBS Sportive and light, that scarcely falls at last.
Nor live we conscious, frequent, of the tread Of animalcules, or the secret path, O'er all our frame, the busy gnat pursues.
For many a primal seed, that rears at large Each member, must be stimulated first, Ere the keen atoms of the soul, hence roused, Engender sense, through every severing space Blending, rebounding, and reblending still.
But 'tis the mind guards chief the gates of life, And than the soul with ampler vigour sways.
For, without mind or spirit, soul itself
In no one portion through the man can live E'en for a moment:
as companion fond With speed it follows, dissipated wide, And leaves the limbs beneath the ice of death:
While he whose mind, whose spirit safe subsists, Still holds existence, though th' exterior form Throughout be mangled;
e'en though much of soul, Though every limb be lost, he still survives Deep in the remnant trunk;
the vital air Still breathes, and lingers out his joyless hours.
Thus, though the visual orb be wounded, still, If safe the central pupil, sight remains:
Where'er descends the blow, should this alone Elude its vengeance, ruin ne'er ensues.
But, if of this the least existent point Once suffer, though the total else escape, Light fails immediate, and dread darkness reigns.
Such the connexion 'twixt the soul and mind.
Now mark profound:
to teach thee how this soul, This subtle spirit, with th' external frame Begot, alike must perish,-next the muse Shall pour forth numbers thine illustrious birth Well worthy, and with sweetest labour culled.
This chief observe, that either phrase assumes
Here a like import;
and that when we urge
The soul is mortal, this the mind includes:
Such their joint bond, their close connexion such.
First, having proved, then, this attenuate power From subtlest atoms reared, minuter far Than those of water, smoke, or buoyant mist, Since much in speed it conquers, and, by force Far less, is roused to action-for full oft E'en the faint phantasms of such forms alone
The soul excites, as when, in deep repose, The fragrant altar smokes, and vapours rich Rise to the view-a sense, no doubt, induced From the light phantasms of substantial forms Floating around us—this already proved, Judge next, since lymph when bursts th' enclosing vase, Flows at each fracture, since fugacious smoke, Since vapours vanish into viewless air, Judge how the soul must dissipate amain, How sooner perish, and its primal seeds Speedier dissolve, when once the flesh they quit.
For since this flesh, the vase the soul that bounds, Bounds it no more when bruised by foreign force, Or of its life-blood robbed,-how canst thou deem Th' unsolid ether, or that aught more rare
Than flesh itself, the soul can e'er confine ?
The mind, moreover, as every hour confirms, Springs with the body, with the body grows, And yields alike to- years.
The tottering babe, Weakly of limb, betrays a mind as weak:
But, as his strength matures, his vigorous soul Ripens in reason, till in equal hour, As age overcomes, and every organ fails, Fail too his mental powers:
then raves the tongue, The judgment raves, the total man declines, And, in a moment, all alike expires.
Hence the whole nature of this reasoning frame
Must all dissolve, as smoke in ambient air, Hence since, as urged above, all springs alike, All ripens gradual, and together droops.
As, too, the body feels full oft the force
Of bitter pains, and many a huge disease-
So strives the mind with grief, and cruel care, Hence proved partaker of one common fate.
In many an ill, moreover, the flesh sustains, The judgment suffers:
the distracted wretch Now raving wild, and sinking, now profound In stupid slumber;
his fixt eyeballs stare, His head hangs heavy, sound no more is heard, Nor the fond visage noticed e'en of those, Who yet, yet calling back to life, bedew With many a tear his mouth and cheeks suffused.
Hence must the mind too, with the body cease, Since by diseases thus alike transfixt:
For grief, for sickness, equal, the dread work Of death accomplish, as each hour confirms.
Why, too, when once the pungent power of wine Flies through the system, and the blood inflames, Why torpid grows each organ ?
reels each limb ?
Falters the tongue ?
rebels the maddening mind ?
Why swim the eyes ?
and hiccough, noise and strife, And each oonsociate ill their force combine ?
Why but that deep the frantic bowl disturbs, Ev'n in the body, the secluded mind ?
But what can once be thus disturbed-what once Impeded-should the hostile power augment, Must perish, doubtless, void of future days.
Oft, too, some wretch, before our startled sight, Struck, as with lightning, by some keen disease, Drops sudden :
-by the dread attack overpowered, He foams, he groans, he trembles, and he faints;
Now rigid, now convulsed, his labouring lungs Heave quick, and quivers each exhausted limb.
Spread through the frame, so deep the dire disease Perturbs his spirit;
as the briny main Foams through each wave beneath the tempest's ire.
He groans, since every member smarts with pain, .And from his inmost breast, with wontless toil, Confused, and harsh, articulation springs.
He raves, since soul and spirit are alike Disturbed throughout, and severed each from each, As urged above, distracted by the bane.
But when, at length, the morbid cause declines, And the fermenting humours from the heart Flow back-with staggering foot the man first treads, Led gradual on to intellect and strength.
Since, then, the soul such various ills endures, E'en in this solid frame,-such various modes Feels of severe distraction—canst thou deem, In the wide air unsheltered and forlorn, Mid boisterous winds, it ever could exist ?
And as the mind, like body, when diseased Heals oft, and owns the genial power of drugs, Hence springs a proof that mind is mortal too.
For he the secret soul, or aught besides, Who fain would change, must lessen or augment Its primal atoms, or combine anew:
But things immortal ne'er can be transposed, Ne'er take addition, or encounter loss.
For what once changes, by the change alone Subverts immediate its anterior life.
Sickening, or healed, then, by balsamic herbs, The seeds of death alike the soul betrays.
So triumph facts o'er all the sophistis art Precluding answer, doubly silenced here.
Of man, moreover, by slow degrees, we mark, Limb after limb consume:
first the pale toes, The nails grow livid;
in succession next
The feet, and legs;
till gradual, o'er the frame, Creeps the chill track of death.
-Since, then, the soul
Thus suffers, nor one moment can resist Sound, and entire, its make must mortal prove.
But should'st thou deem, when thus assailed, it shrinks Back through each member, to one point condensed-
Then must that point, towards which the soul retreats, Throng with increased sensation:
but as this Time ne'er evinces, it must still disperse Like tattered shreds by every wind destroyed.
Yet grant the converse, and the soul allow
In those concentrates, gradual who decline ;
— Say what imports it whether wide it waste From limb to limb, or perish from one point ?
Still more and more sensation fails, and life Less and still less its dwindled power sustains.
Since, too, the mind forms part of man, and dwells
In one fixt spot, as dwells the eye or ear, Or aught besides of sense that governs life ;
And since, moreover, the sight, the hand, the nose, Once severed from us, feel not, nor exist, Dissolving instant-so the mind alike Lives not alone without th' exterior frame, Which like a vessel holds it, or aught else, If aught there be, of bond compactor still.
So to the body cleaves th' adhesive mind.
The vital power, moreover, of each subsists Alone conjoint, for mutual is their life.
Nor without body can the soul fulfil Its destined functions, nor the body live Of soul devoid, participant of sense.
As the bare eye, when rooted from its orb, Sees nought around it, spirit thus and soul Nought can accomplish singly;
—hence diffused Through every vessel, organ, bone, and nerve, Of all that breathes.
Nor part their primal seeds
With long interstice, fatal to the power
Of resilition;
rather so confined, As sensile motions fits them best t' excite:
Such as, at death, when mixt with vacant air, 'Twere vain to expect, of all restraint devoid.
For air itself must body first become Compact and vital, ere the secret soul Its pores can tenant, or those motions urge, Urged, during life, through all the sentient frame.
Hence doubly flows it why the soul and mind, One in themselves, of body when disrobed, And scattered boundless, instant should dissolve.
Since, too, the body the departed soul Endures not, but with putrid smell decays, Canst thou, then, doubt the soul, when thus effused, Like smoke flies total, every seed disperst?
And that th' external frame thus sinks defiled
In putrid death, since from their wonted posts Urged off, through every passage, every pore, Press the percipient seeds, from every limb, From every membrane o'er the system spread ?
And seest thou not, from many a fact hence proved, That through the total body lives the soul, And e'en in body severs, seed from seed, Ere thence expelled, and scattered into air ?
E'en during life the fractured soul seems oft From force abrupt half-hurried from her home;
Each vital function failing, and the face, As though in death, all pallid, changed, and wan.
Such the deep swoon evinces, when within Sinks the faint spirit, and each prostrate power Pants for its final doom.
Such then the force
That mind and body oft alike unnerves
That, but the least augmented, death ensues.
Can, then, the soul, thus impotent of frame, When once disrobed, abandoned, and exposed, Through the wide air, to every boisterous breeze, Can it then triumph, dost thou firmly deem, Not o'er all time, but e'en one moment live?
Nor do the dying e'er the soul perceive Rush out entire, when exiled from the heart, The bronchial tube first filling, then the throat, And mouth successive;
but at once it fails
In its own region, as each sense alike Fails in its destined theatre of power.
Were, too, its date immortal, man no more, At his last hour, would mourn the severing blow:
Charmed to throw off his vesture, like the snake, Or, like the stag his antlers, and be free.
Why, too, are wisdom and the mind restrained To one sole organ, while the feet, the hands, These never gender ?
why but that each spot Exists for some fixt function-nor can e'er Pervert its destined view ?
while, through the whole, Nice order reigns by nought preposterous marred.
So flows the tide of things, nor water fire, Through time, creates, nor fire the sparry frost.
Were, too, the soul immortal, and possest
Of ancient powers when severed from the flesh, Then with new organs must it, or we err, Be instant re-endowed;
for thus alone Th' infernal shades can tread the shores of hell.
Thus painters feign them, and the bards renowned
Of ancient times—thoughtless that eyes, and nose, And hands, and mouth, to the divided soul Can ne'er pertain, nor e'en the sense of sound.
And since the total system soul pervades, And vital action-when some blow severe Midway divides it, part from part, abrupt, Then must the soul alike be cleft in twain, Driven with the mangled body.
But what thus Admits partition, and to foreign force Yields e'en but once, immortal ne'er can be.
Oft, arm'd with scythes, the warlike car, we read, Hot with repeated slaughters, so abrupt Severs a limb, that o'er the field it lies With life long quivering, while the hero still Fights on, of pain unconscious:
his high soul Absorbed so total, he nor heeds the loss
Of his broad shield, or shield-supporting hand, Whirled in the strife of coursers, and of cars.
From this the sword-arm drops, while still the rock
He climbs impetuous;
that, perchance, to earth Felled, on one leg yet vainly strives to rise;
While, at his side, his amputated foot Its trembling toes still moves.
Thus, too, the head, Whene'er dissevered from the vital trunk, Still keeps its look of life, with open eye Still stares, till all the gradual soul expire.
So should thy blade some serpent's length of tail Divide, quick-brandishing its furious tongue, The severed parts writhe, agonized, and broad Scatter the purple fluid ;
while himself Looks round revengeful, and, from pain severe, Gnashes the segments of his mangled frame.
Shall we then say that each divided part
A perfect soul contains ?
then with such souls
The total form, ere injured, must have thronged.
Hence severs, then, the soul, though close combined, Anterior, with the body;
and hence, too, Both must alike be mortal, since alike To parts divisible with equal ease.
Grant, too, the soul immortal, and infused, At earliest birth, within us—whence, resolve, This full oblivion of all past events, All former life ?-for if the soul so change, That nought remains of memory in its make, A change so total differs scarce from death.
Thus, what before existed, must have ceased, And on its ruins sprung what now exists.
If the light soul, moreover, then only join
The full-formed body, when that body first Springs into birth, and treads the porch of life, Ne'er can it then, as though diffused at large, E'en with the vital blood, through all the frame, Grow with each growing member:
but confined, As in a den, in solitude must dwell, From the first hour exciting equal sense.
Hence doubly flows it, souls can ne'er exist
Of birth devoid, nor free from final fate.
Nor could they, as each daily fact confirms, If from without infused, the total frame Fit with such nice precision :
for so close
Blend they with every organ, bone, and nerve, That e'en th' enamelled tooth sensation shares;
As oft its ache evinces, or the approach Of ice abrupt;
or when, beneath its gripe, Grate some harsh pebble mid the subject food.
Nor thus connected could they e'er retreat Safe, and uninjured through the sinuous paths
Of organs, membranes, vessels, bones, and nerves.
But, from without, th' insinuating soul, If still thou deem through all this frame diffused, Then, since diffused, much surer must it fail;
For what thus flows diffusive, must dissolve, And perish, doubtless, forced through every pore.
As vanish foods, through every mazy gland, Through every limb when urged, to different forms Converting gradual, so the mind, the soul Howe'er entire, when first the flesh it meets Dissolves by junction ;
for through every sluice, Through every organ intricate and fine, Must percolate its atoms, severed hence, And decomposed,-and hence the base alone Of that which after sways th' external frame.
Thus must the soul a natal day possess, And final grave, an origin and end.
Fly, too, at death, the soul's pure'seeds entire, Or with the body are there still that rest ?
If aught remain, then idly must thou deem
The soul immortal, since diminished thus, And shorn of substance;
but if all escape, If not an atom loiter-whence, I ask, Rears the putrescent carcass, in its womb, The race of worms ?
or sport o'er every limb
The boneless, bloodless crowds of things unnamed ?
If from without thou deem their souls they draw, To each a soul entire, unheeding here
What throngs must flock where dwelt but one before, Pause yet one moment ere thou thus resolve:
Such souls must, then, the vermin seeds themselves
Have wise-selected, and their fabrics reared, Or into bodies entered ready formed.
But nor can reason, if themselves have raised
The wretched buildings, for the toil account, Nor tell why thus for hunger, and disease, And shivering cold they thirst, or aught besides
Of ill the body to the soul supplies.
Yet grant them anxious for such vile abodes, Still must the structure far exceed their powers, Hence reared not by themselves.
Nor from without Could they insinuate into bodies formed;
Since nor adapted to their sinuous pores, Nor framed for intercourse, and mutual act.
Whence springs the fury that pervades throughout
The ruthless breed of lions ?
whence the craft
The fox evinces, or the stag's wild fear, From sire to son through every race propelled ?
Whence these and equal passions traced at large, From life's first dawn, generic, through each class ?
Whence but that some fixt power of mind descends.
E'en with the lineal seed, through all begot, Evolving gradual with the gradual growth ?
For were the soul immortal, changing oft
To different bodies, different tempers, then, Must mark each order;
the HYRCANIAN dog Oft, then, must dread the high-horned stag's approach;
Hawks fly from doves, e'en man himself turn brute, And the brute tribes, preposterous, rule the world.
Nor heed the sophistry which here contends
That souls oft change the body's change to meet:
For that which changes must dissolve, and die, Severed its parts, its order all destroyed.
Hence souls must, too, dissolve through every limb, And with the body share one common fate.
But should'st thou urge that human souls their flight
To human forms restrain-then, since once wise, To folly why relapse ?
why spring not boys Replete with wisdom ?
nor displays the colt
The skilful paces of the steed mature ?
Why but that some fixt power of mind descends E'en with the lineal seed through all begot, Evolving gradual with the gradual growth ?
Nor think the soul, too, weakens in a weak
And puny system, since most surely then Doomed to destruction ;
by the change sustained Shorn of its vigour, and interior sense.
Why, if endeared not by one common birth, Thus should it pant in equal hour to reach Perfection with the body ?
or, reversed, Why long for freedom when the frame decays ?
Fears, then, the soul confinement after death
Mid the foul members ?
or the dangerous fall
Of its own tottering mansion ?
But, reflect, What lives immortal, danger ne'er can know.
What, too, so idle, as that souls should throng Round each vile intercourse, or beast that bears:
Immortal souls !
contesting who shall first Enter the feeble fetus;
if, perchance, This not decides them, and all strife precludes, That who first gains it, claims a prior right.
Trees not in ether, not in ocean clouds, Nor in the fields can fishes e'er exist;
Nor blood in planks, nor vital juice in stones;
But all springs definite in scenes defined.
So in the bosom lives, and there alone, Mixt with its blood, and nerves, the secret mind:
There only lives,-for could it roam at all, Then rather should we through the body's self, The heel, or shoulder, or where else it chose, Oft trace it wandering, than forlorn abroad.
Since e'en in body, then, the soul and mind Are fixt thus definite—we amply prove
That out of body these can ne'er exist:
That when the flesh its certain doom sustains, The soul must, too, through every limb dissolve.
To deem, moreover, that mortal can combine With aught immortal,-can together live Concordant, and in mutual duties blend, Is full delirium.
Can there be conceived Aught more unmeet, incongruous, or absurd, Than with a mortal that a frame should mix Immortal, doomed to all its weight of woe ?
What lives immortal, too, must so exist, Or from its own solidity, empowered Each blow to conquer, undivided still, As primal atoms, long anterior sung;
Or since, like vacuum, of all friction void, Free from all touch, by impulse unimpaired;
Or from the want of circling space, in which The severing atoms may dissolve and fall;
Such want the boundless whole of nature proves, And hence eternal-for no place beyond Spreads, where its seeds could waste;
nor, from without, Can foreign force e'er enter to destroy.
But nor, as urged above, exists the mind All solid, since in all things void combines, Nor yet all vacuum ;
nor, from the profound, Are wanting powers adverse that, into act Once roused tempestuous, the whole mind derange, Or sever total ;
-nor deficient space Spread widely round, through which, in countless modes, The mental frame may crumble, and dissolve;
Hence not precluded from the gates of death.
But should'st thou still the soul immortal deem, Since guarded deep from many a mortal wound, Safe from full many an insult that assails
The health exterior, and since many a blow, Aimed at its powers, discomfited recoils Ere scarce ourselves the dread approach perceive, Still far thou wanderest;
for the common woes Excluding that from body draw their birth, Yet pines she anxious for to-morrow's fate, Yet shakes with dread, with carking care consumes, Or smarts from conscience of committed crimes.
Add, too, that madness is her own-that oft All memory fails, and o'er each torpid power, Creeps the dull pool of lethargy profound.
Hence, death is nought, and justly claims our scorn, Since with the body thus the soul decays.
And as we now, through long anterior time, Look back indifferent on the PUNIC hosts
That threatened ROME, when, with the din of war, All shook tremendous heaven's high cope beneath, And doubtful hung the scale which power should rule Earth, main, and mortals, with unrivalled sway;
So when we cease, and soul and body once
Meet their joint doom whose union formed our lives, No ill shall then molest us,—nought alarm Our scattered senses, and dissevered frame, Though earth with main, or main commix with skies.
E'en could the soul, the spirit still survive
The wreck corporeal, and perception boast, To us what boots it, who exist alone
The joint result of soul and body mixt ?
To us what boots it, should some future time Collect our atoms, the dismantled frame Restore entire, and e'en with life relume, When once the memory of ourselves is fled ?
We heed not now what erst, in time elapsed, We have been, nor with anxious heart explore
What from our dust hereafter may arise:
For if thou weigh th' eternal tract of time Evolved already, and the countless modes
In which all matter moves, thou canst not doubt
That oft its atoms have the form assumed
We bear ourselves this moment-though the mind Recalls not now those scenes of being past;
For many a pause the discontinuous chain
Of life has severed, and full many a mode
Of motion sprung to every sense adverse.
He to whom pain hereafter is decreed Must then exist whene'er that pain arrives.
But as the man, whose atoms erst have lived, Lives now unconscious of ills then sustained, By death since decomposed, and every power Of sense and memory scattered-hence we prove Death holds no sting t' alarm us;
that the man To be who ceases, ceases from all woe ;
Nor aught imports it that he e'er was born, When death immortal claims his mortal life.
Should'st thou, then, mark some fool indignant burn
At this alone, that, when existence fails, His corse may moulder, or in flames consume, Or sate, perchance, the jaws of savage beasts-
Believe him not :
-some secret dread still lurks
Of future pain, though e'en his lips deny
That sense or thought can after death exist.
Thus, if I err not, he conceals his creed, Believes not life all-ceases, but that still Some future self his present will survive.
For he who, living, shudders at the thought
That birds or beasts his frame may soon devour, That frame divides not, but his self confounds
With his own future corse, whose dread decay
This self, he deems, must witness and partake.
Hence heaves his heart indignant at the doom
Of mortal man:
heedless that, after death, No other self shall then himself bemoan, Nor feel the tooth that tears his mangled limbs.
If, too, the tiger's tusk, the vulture's beak, Be deemed an ill—what lighter ill results
From the red fury of the funeral pyre ?
The fulsome tide of honey, o'er the frame Poured, cold and stiffening in the marble tomb ?
Or the sunk grave, by earth's vast pressure crushed ?"
But thy dear home shall never greet thee more!
No more the best of wives!—thy babes beloved, Whose haste half-met thee, emulous to snatch
The dulcet kiss that roused thy secret soul, Again shall never hasten !-nor thine arm, With deed heroic, guard thy country's weal!- O mournful, mournful fate!" thy friends exclaim, " One envious hour of these invalued joys Robs thee for ever!"
—But they add not here, " It robs thee, too, of all desire of joy” A truth, once uttered, that the mind would free From every dread, and trouble. " Thou art safe!
The sleep of death protects thee !
and secures From all th' unnumbered woes of mortal life!
While we, alas !
the sacred urn around
That holds thine ashes, shall insatiate weep, Nor time destroy th' eternal grief we feel!"
What then has death, if death be mere repose, And quiet only in a peaceful grave, What has it thus to mar this life of man ?
Yet mar it does.
E'en o'er the festive board,
The glass while grasping, and with garlands crowned, The thoughtless maniacs oft indignant roar, " How short the joys of wine !—e'en while we drink Life ceases, and to-morrow ne'er returns!"
As if, in death, the worst such wretches feared Were thirst unquenched, parching every nerve, Or deemed their passions would pursue them still.
Not anxious, thus, mankind the world resign
At evening hour when soul and body rest;
Nor would they though that rest were ne'er to end:
Nor thus the day's desire pursues their dreams;
Though then the seeds of sense not wander far From sensile movements, scarcely, oft, allayed, And quick resumed when starts the soul at morn.
Of much less moment, then, should death be held Than sleep, if aught can less than that which ne'er Moment excites whatever;
for the crowd
Of sensile seeds are wider here disperst;
Nor wakes he e'er to action, and the day, Whose frame once feels the chilling pause of life.
Were then THE NATURE OF CREATED THINGS To rise abrupt, and thus repining man Address—" 0 mortal!
whence these useless fears ?
This weak, superfluous sorrow ?
why th' approach Dread'st thou of death?
For if the time elapsed Have smiled propitious, and not all its gifts, As though adventured in a leaky vase, Been idly wasted, profitless, and vain-
Why quitt'st thou not, thou fool!
the feast of life Filled,-and with mind all panting for repose ?
But if thyself have squandered every boon, And of the past grown weary-why demand More days to kill, more blessings to pervert, Nor rather headlong hasten to thine end ?
For nothing further can my powers devise
To please thee ;
-things for ever things succeed Unchanged,—and would do, though revolving years Should spare thy vigour, and thy brittle frame Live o'er all time:
e'en amplier would'st thou then Mark how unvaried all creation moves."- Were NATURE thus t' address us, could we fail
To feel the justice of her keen rebuke ?
So true the picture, the advice so sage !
But to the wretch who moans th' approach of death With grief unmeasured, louder might she raise Her voice severe—“ Vile coward !
dry thine eyes-
Hence with thy snivelling sorrows, and depart!"
Should he, moreover, have past man's mid-day hour­ "
What!
thou lament ?
already who hast reaped
An ample harvest ?
by desiring thus
The past once more, the present thou abhorr'st, And life flies on imperfect, unenjoyed, And death untimely meets thee, ere thy soul, Cloyed with the banquet, is prepared to rise.
Leave, then, to others bliss thy years should shun ;
Come, cheerful leave it, since still leave thou must."
Justly I deem might NATURE thus reprove:
For, through creation, old to young resigns, And this from that matures;
nor aught descends
To the dread gulfs, the fancied shades of hell.
The mass material must survive entire To feed succeeding ages, which, in turn, Like thee shall flourish, and like thee shall die;
Nor more the present ruins than the past.
Thus things from things ascend;
and life exists
To none a freehold, but a use to all.
Reflect, moreover, how less than nought to us Weighs the long portion of eternal time Fled ere our birth:
so, too, the future weighs
When death dissolves us.
What of horror, then, Dwells there in death ?
what gloomy, what austere ?
Can there be elsewhere slumber half so sound?
The tales of hell exist not in the grave, But here, and curse us living.
TANTALUS, With broad, rough rock impending o'er his head, And crazed with terror, there is never seen:
But terror dwells with mortals—fate they fear, And fortune, and a host of fancied gods.
Nor TITYUS there exists, the prey of birds.
Nor, though he did, could these the victim's breast Consume for ever ;
e'en though his wide bulk, Not thrice three acres merely might extend, But cover the vast globe;
nor could he bear Eternal pain, nor yield perpetual food.
But he is TITYUS, and by vultures torn, Whose anxious breast the rage of love devours;
Or aught of passion equal in its force.
Here, too, is Sisyphus—the man who pants For public honours, and the giddy crowd Caresses ever, ever but in vain.
For thus to toil for power, itself at- best A bubble, and that bubble ne'er to boast, Yet still toil on-is doubtless to roll back, Up the high hill, the huge, stern, struggling stone;
That which, the steep peak once urged up, rebounds Rapid, resistless, over all the plain.
Then, too, to feed th' ungrateful mind, and fill With every good, while still it craves for more, (As feed mankind the seasons in their turn, With fruits, ana endless beauties, while themselves Still riot on, and never have enough,) This, or I err, the fable well unfolds, Feigned of the damsels doomed, in flower of youth, To fill for ever the still leaking urn.
The FURIES, CERBERUS, and HELL itself
Of light devoid, and belching from its jaws Tremendous fires, live not, nor can they live:
But well they paint the dread of justice here
For crimes atrocious, the reward of guilt, The scourge, the wheel, the block, the dungeon deep, The base-born hangman, the TARPEIAN cliff ;
Which, though the villain 'scape, his conscious soul Still fears perpetual, torturing all his days, And still foreboding heavier pangs at death.
Hence earth itself to fools becomes a hell.
Thus ponder oft, retired:
ANcus the good, E'en he has closed his eyes on mortal things;
A man, thou coward !
worthier far than thou !
Thousands, moreover, like him of crowns possest, Have fall'n like him, and all their pomp resigned.
E'en he who wandered o'er the mighty main, Led on his legions, and first oped the way To tread on foot th' unfathomed gulfs below, He who thus braved the billows, and the storms, Has closed his eye-lids, and his soul resigned.
—SCIPIO, the war's dread thunderbolt, the scourge Of ransacked TYRE, sleeps, like the slave, inhumed.
Add, too, the founders of the graceful arts, And schools erudite ;
-add th' immortal bards;
Add HOMER'S self the muses' realm who rules;
These all, like meaner mortals, rest in peace.
—When hoary hairs DEMOCRITUS forewarned
His mental powers were hastening to decay, Quick he uprose, and midway met his fate.
-E'en he is fallen, his lamp of life extinct, Th' illustrious EPICURUS, whose vast mind Triumphant rose o'er all men, and excelled, As, in the heavens, the sun excels the stars.
And dost thou murmur, and indignant die, Whose life, while living, scarcely death exceeds ?
Thou !
who in sleep devourest half thy days ?
And, e'en awake, who snorest, dreaming still, And torturing all thy mind with vain alarms ?
Thou !
who lamentest, oft, unknowing why, Urged on, with fear intoxicated deep, And in a maze of mental errors lost ?
Did men but think, and oft to think they seem, That from themselves their heaviest sorrows rise, And knew they too whence thus themselves create
These bosom sufferings-seldom should we see Life spent as now each passing hour portrays.
All pant perpetual for they know not what, Nor learn by searching-changing their abodes, As though the change would leave their load behind.
This, from mere listlessness, his mansion flies;
Straight he returns ;
—’tis listless all abroad.
That to his villa posts, with rapid wheels, As though the building were in flames, and called His instant aid.
-No sooner treads his foot
The sounding hall, than, on the sofa thrown, He yawns disgusted-or indulges sleep, And seeks oblivion ;
or, perchance, he starts, And towards the town drives back with equal speed.
Thus each his self would fly, that self which still Haunts every step, and every pain creates, Heedless of what torments him:
which if clear
The wanderer traced, his restless soul, at once
The world forsaking, and the world's vain boasts, Would scan THE NATURE OF CREATED THINGS.
For little weighs the passing hour of time
When with eternity compared, that state Which, after death, to mortals yet remains.
Through what vast woes this wild desire of life Drives us, afraid !
what dangers, and what toils!
Yet death still hastens, nor can mortal man, With all his efforts, turn th' unerring shaft.
Life, through its circuit too, is still the same, Nor can it boast one source of new delight.
The bliss we covet seems, at distant view, To all superior;
but, when once possest, It cloys, we spurn it, and another call.
Yet the same thirst of life corrodes us still, Though doubtful of to-morrow, and the fate To-morrow brings—our blessing, or our curse.
E'en could we life elongate, we should ne'er Subtract one moment from the reign of death, Nor the deep slumber of the grave curtail.
O'er ages could we triumph-death alike Remains eternal-nor of shorter date To him who yesterday the light forsook, Than him who died full many a year before.
PIERIAN paths I tread untrod before.
Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new, Sweet the new flowers that bloom ;
but sweeter still
Those flowers to pluck, and weave a roseate wreath
The muses yet to mortals ne'er have deigned.
With joy the subject I pursue, and free
The captive mind from Superstition's yoke:
With joy th* obscure illume;
in liquid verse, Graceful and clear, depicting all surveyed :
By reason guided.
For as oft, benign,
The sapient nurse, when anxious to enforce
On the pale boy the wormwood's bitter draught, With luscious honey tints the goblet's edge, Deceiving thus, while yet unused to guile, His unsuspecting lip, till deep he drinks, And gathers vigour from the venial cheat;
-
So I, since dull the subject, and the world Abashed recoils;
would fain, in honeyed phrase, Tuned by the muses, to thine ear recite Its vast concerns;
if haply I may hope To fix thine audience, whilp the flowing verse Unfolds the nature, and the use of things.
Since, then, our earlier strain the fact has proved
Of seeds primordial;
how, in various forms, Oft differing each from each, at will they roam, Urged on by ceaseless motion,-proved the mode Whence all existing, thence exists alone:
Since, too, the mind's deep nature we have traced, Whence first it springs, with body how unites, And how, when severed, to primordial seeds Again it lapses ;
-haste we next t' unfold Those forms minute, a theme connected close, Termed by the learned IMAGES OF THINGS :
Forms that, like pellicles, when once thrown off Clear from the Surface of whatever exists, Float unrestrained through ether.
Fearful these
Oft through the day, when obvious to the sense, But chief at midnight, when in dreams we view Dire shapes and apparitions, from the light Shut out for ever, and each languid limb With horror gaunt convulsing in its sleep.
For deem not thou the soul can e'er escape From hell profound;
that spectres of the dead Can haunt the living;
or that aught we feel
One hour survives when once the stroke of fate Severs the mind from body, and remands Each to th' appropriate atoms whence they sprang.
Hence hold we firm that effigies of things, Fine, filmy floscules from the surface fly, Like peels, or membranes, of whatever exists;
The form precise, how wide soe'er diffused, Maintaining still the parent body boasts.
This e'en the dull may learn;
since sight itself Marks the light film from many a substance urged, Oft loosely floating, as the fume impure From crackling faggots, or the brighter blaze Of red, resplendent furnace;
oft compact, And firm of texture as the silken veil Thrown from the grasshopper, when summer wanes, By many a month worn out;
or that the calf Casts on his birth-day;
or the spotted robe Rent from the snake, that trembles on the brier, The brier full oft with spoils like these bedeckt.
Since these exist, then, floscules rarer still May, too, be exiled from the face of things:
For why the grosser, palpable to sight.
Should rather thus exfoliate, than the flake
Of finer texture that all sight eludes, The mind discerns not;
for such viewless flakes Live, doubtless, o'er each surface loose diffused, Ranged ever equal, and with ampler ease Dispelled, since gendered of a lighter frame, And in the front of objects fixt supreme.
For sight not merely bodies marks minute Thrown from th' interior, or the base profound, As proved already, but, like rainbow hues, Poured from the surface.
This the crowd surveys
Oft in the theatre, whose curtains broad, Bedecked with crimson, yellow, or the tint Of steel cerulean, from their fluted heights Wave tremulous;
and, o'er the scene beneath, Each marble statue, and the rising rows
Of rank and beauty, fling their tint superb.
While as the walls, with ampler shade repel
The garish noon-beam, every object round as Laughs with a deeper dye, and wears profuse A lovelier lustre, ravished from the day.
As then the trembling drapery ejects Hues from its surface, superficial too From every substance effigies minute Must stream perpetual, each alike discharged.
And hence from all things vestiges there are Of subtlest texture hovering through the void, All sight evading when but simply poured.
Each essence, vapour, fume, or aught alike Attenuate, hence alone flows void of form, That, gendered deep within, through tortuous paths Loose, and disjoined, it struggles to the day ;
While the light quintessence of utmost hues Streams unobstructed as supremely placed.
The main, moreover, the mirror, or aught else
Of polished front, each object full reflects With perfect semblance.
Whence this semblance fair But from supernal images expelled ?
These, as more gross, we mark ;
yet why the gross
Should rather thus exfoliate than the flake
Of subtler texture reason ne'er can prove.
Hence effigies there are from all things poured
Of nice resemblance, and the fairest web;
Which, though, when single, from the sight concealed, When close reflected in perpetual stream From the clear mirror, obvious meet the view.
Nor can the sophist other cause adduce
Whence springs the picture so correctly just.
Come, now, and mark with what attenuate frame Such pictures live.
This the prime seeds of things
So fugitive to sense, so less than aught
The keenest sight can pierce, perchance may prove, How subtle these, then, thus the muse explains.
First, there are insects so minute, the view Not half their puny members can discern.
What here are organs ?
what intestines here ?
The globule what that forms their heart or eye ?
Their tiny limbs ?
their tendons ?
but o'er all
What the nice atoms whence the soul proceeds?
Each part so subtile, so minute the whole.
Next, each wild herb that from its branches pours Ungrateful odours, southernwood severe, The rueful wormwood, centaury, or that Famed for all cures, termed all-heal by the crowd, These, by the lightest finger brushed, emit Myriads of effigies in various modes Void of all strength, wide hovering unperceived.
Such who can calculate ?
what powers of mind Scan their light textures, or their woof unfold?
Yet deem not thou such images alone From things themselves emane;
spontaneous, too, Spring they in heaven above, combining strange, Borne through th' aerial realms in modes diverse, Their forms for ever shifting, till at length Nought lives on earth the phantoms never ape.
Hence clouds concrete, th' aerial vault serene Shadowing with moisture, grateful as it moves:
Hence, shapes gigantic spread, protruding broad Their interposing features;
mountains hence, And mountain-rocks, torn from their base abrupt, Seem oft to hover, blotting now the sun With front opposed, now deep diffused behind, Gendering fresh clouds, a monster each to view.
Mark, now, how swift such phantoms form-how swift Exhale from all things, and, when formed, dissolve.
A steam there is that from the face of things Pours forth perpetual.
This, when urged amain
On porous textures, as the clothes we wear, Pierces entire:
when bold with wood, or stone
It dares conflict, the subtile membrane breaks, Nor aught returns of semblance;
but when flung On dense and splendid objects (foremost such Shines the pure mirror) nought of these ensues:
For then nor pierces the light lymph, nor quick Breaks ere the mirror give the semblance sound.
Hence springs the vision, every object hence, Opposed to splendours, pours perpetual forth Its mimic likeness ;
and, perpetual too, Hence the pure effluence that the likeness yields Must fleetly rush, reiterated urged.
As from the sun each moment many a ray Must flow that things with lustre may be filled, from each object many an image light Streams without end ;
for, turn howe'er thou please
The splendid plate, still the same semblance springs, Punctual in form, appropriate in its dyes.
Oft, too, the lucid front of heaven serene Blackens abrupt;
in subtlest vapours veiled So blackens, fancy may conceive all hell Had with his direst shades the welkin stormed, Shivering with horror every human nerve.
But what such vapours to the films of things ?
These who can calculate ?
what powers of mind Scan their light textures, or their woof unfold ?
Thus proved attenuate, mark, benignant, next, Their keen rapidity:
with what vast speed Fleet they through ether, with elastic wing Conquering dull time, urged various to their goals.
This shall the muse in melodies evince
More sweet than prolix;
as the swan's lone dirge Flows forth superior to the clamorous croak
Of countless cranes, by every wind disperst.
Know, then, th' attenuate substance must move quick ;
But few th' exceptions.
Hence the rapid race
Of light, and lustre from th' effusive sun, Since these, too, spring from atoms most minute, With ease protruded, by posterior force Urged on ;
for light for ever light succeeds, And floods of splendour floods of splendour drive.
Hence, from like cause, the semblances of things Through countless space must instantaneous rush ;
For equal powers propellant press behind, And the same texture rears them that pervades Forms most compact, and fills th' aerial void.
If, too, those particles of things that lurk Deep in th' interior, oft sublimely bound, And quit the surface, as the sun's pure light, And lustre fair, if instant these we view Rush through all space, o'er earth and main diffuse, And heaven's high arch, by utmost lightness winged;
Say, what the speed of atoms placed supreme, Poured from the front of things, by nought delayed ?
Seest thou not these, in the same point of time, With swifter flight through ampler bounds must dart
Than the blue radiance that through ether streams ?
To proofs thus cogent of the rapid race
Of insubstantial semblances, adjoin
This fact decisive;
that, when once at night, th the spangled concave, gleams the vase Filled from the bubbling brook, the curious eye Marks in the lymph, responsive, every star That strews with silver all the radiant pole.
Seest thou not hence, then, in what point of time
Th' ethereal image darts from heaven to earth ?
Hence doubly flows it such stupendous forms
Must crowd th' horizon, and the sight compel, Of things defined born ceaseless.
From the sun
Thus heat exhales, cold, dewy damp from streams,
And the rough spray from ocean, with fierce fang Gnawing the mound that dares resist its waves.
Thus sounds, too, hover in the breezy air;
And, when the beach we traverse, oft the tongue Smarts with the briny vapour:
or if chance, By dexterous leech, fell wormwood near be bruised, We taste th' essential bitter, and abhor.
Thus some light effluence streams from all create, Streams forth for ever, void of dull repose, Towards every point diffused:
for man perceives, Where'er his station, sight alike exists, The sense of fluent odours, and of sounds.
And as, moreover, th' essaying hand decides
Oft in the dark an object as precise
As the keen eye at mid-day,—hence we deem Touch and the sight by equal causes swayed.
Thus, if a cube we handle, and, at night, Its shape assure us, what but the mere shape Proves the same substance is a cube by day ?—
Hence shapes, hence images alone create
All we survey, of vision the sole cause:
And hence from every object forms like these Towards every point must radiate ;
since the eye, Source of all sight, where'er its orb inclines, Sees all that moves, in shape and hue precise:
And since such semblances alone decide
How distant dwells each substance we discern.
These sole decide ;
for every film exhaled Drives on immediate the recumbent air Placed 'twixt the visual orb and object viewed.
Then fleets its total column, o'er the ball Rushing amain, till all its gradual length Strikes on the sentient pupil, and retires.
Hence how far distant judge we things exist;
And as an ampler air, and larger tide
Of friction goad the vision, cautious, thus, Deem more remote th' objective substance lies.
While such the speed evinced, at once we tell
The thing surveyed, its distance and its kind.
Nor wondrous this, that, though, when singly urged, Each separate image viewless strikes the sight, The parent form springs obvious.
When severe Blows the fresh breeze, each particle of wind, Of bitter cold the sense can ne'er discern, But the full body rather:
then the frame Shrinks as though blows from some exterior foe Were plied perpetual, every nerve availed.
When, too, the finger o'er the polished spar Lets fall its weight, it touches then alone
The crystal hues, and surface;
yet nor hues Nor surface feels it, but the hardness sole Its total body boasts, compact and firm.
Now next unfold we whence the semblance seen
In the clear mirror, far beyond recedes, Or so pretends, deceptive.
Sleights like these
We trace for ever when th' attentive eye Peeps in some hall, beyond th' unfolded doors, And through their vista marks the scene without.
In both a twin, a double tide of air Strikes on the vision.
In the mansion thus First floats th' interior ether, bounded close
By the broad portals opening right and left, Then light external, and another air Assail the pupil, and the real scene
At last developes.
Thus the semblance too, The mirror's self projects, as towards the sight 1
It yet, yet tends, the midway air protrudes Placed 'twixt the visual orb and object viewed;
Whence first th' aerial tide assaults us ere Conspicuous springs the mirror;
which surveyed, Next instant flows the semblance from ourselves Ceaseless exhaled, and from the splendid plate Reflected punctual, visiting in turn
The sentient eye-ball, and in turn its tide Of air first forcing o'er the goaded view;
Thus doubly distant, and the glass beyond Painting the mimic image we discern.
Hence not the meanest marvel can attach
To forms reflected from the fulgent plain Through two-fold airs, by the twin tide resolved.
The part, too, of the semblance that to us
The right creates, seems, in the mirror, left:
Hence Springs the vision, that when once the film Strikes on the level radiance, it rebounds Unaltered never, by th' elastic blow In every trait reversed:
as when we dash, 'Gainst some broad beam, the new-made mask of clay Soft yet, and pliant, if with front direct
It bear the blow, the hollow frame inverts:
Each feature then transposes, the right eye Claims the left side, the left the right usurps.
From mirror, too, to mirror may we spread
The playful image, till its like, with ease, Be thrice, or ampler doubled ;
and till nought Lurk so retired, so deep behind, so hid In tortuous angles, but that many a plate, Rightly disposed, may yet through every maze Drag forth the latent landscape, and at large E'en in the mansion's central depths display.
So glides from glass to glass the semblance true
By each transposed in order, right and left Changing alternate, and again restored.
Mirrors there are, moreover, of shape rotund With flexile sides like mortals, that present To right or left each object free from change.
Thus solve the problem that the convex plate, Like a twin mirror, twice the scene reflects Ere yet it touch the vision;
or, perchance, Th* approaching image turns completely round, A turn the flexile splendour proves precise.
-Then the light image, too, with us affects
To move responsive, every gesture caught.
Hence the deception, that whatever the part
Of the pure plate relinquished, thence no more Flies the fleet semblance ;
fate's eternal laws Deciding ceaseless that the film propelled Must bear each variance of the parent form.
Such are the sleights of mirrors.
Mark we next,
How hates the eye-ball every gaudy glare ;
How darkens in the sun when poured direct;
Such his vast power.
Yet here that power alike Flows from a stream of effigies through heaven Impetuous flung, the tender pupil oft Wounding severely ;
and, at times, so fierce Rushes the radiant tide, the total orb Burns with the fiery particles contained.
The jaundiced thus, not unaccordant, see All clad in yellow, many a yellow seed Forced from their frames, the semblances of things Accosting frequent;
and the lurid eye, Deep, too, imbued with its contagious hue, Painting each image that its disc assails.
Things in the light, though in the dark ourselves, We mark conspicuous;
for as the black air Adjoining, first usurps th' expanded eye, Quick flows th' illumined tide, from every shade Purging the pupil, formed of finer seeds, More potent far, more voluble in act.
Hence as at once the visual orb it clears, Till then obstructed, and with lustre fills, Each floating image, in the light exhaled, Next rushes, and its stimulus applies.
But when, reversed, from day to dark we look, We see not, for the stream of shadowy air That last arrives, of grosser texture wrought, Fills every avenue, each optic nerve Clogs, and the semblances of things arrests.
View yon square turrets, too, that guard our state From hills remote, and each appears rotund.
Hence solve the vision;
that, at distance seen, All angles soften;
first surveyed obtuse, Then fading total;
the dilated orb Attaining never, or devoid of force:
For the light image, through the fluttering air As swift it glides, abrades at every point.
Hence, as each angle flies the prying sight, Cylindric seems the structure, distant far From the true circle, but cylindric still.
The shade, moreo'er, moves with us in the sun, Attends our steps, and every gesture apes;
Moves, or so seems, if terms like these apply To aught like shadow, the mere void alone Of light, and lustre.
Such the phase evinced,
Thou thus resolve it;
that, whene'er we walk Beneath the solar blaze aslant propelled, Our interposing limbs perforce must hide
The heavenly ray from spots illumined else, And still illumed the moment we forsake:
Hence must the shadow with the moving frame Seem, too, to move most punctual;
for the streams
Of new-born radiance that for ever flow Die instant, as the filaments of wool
In fiercest flames, by streams succeeded still:
Whence quick of light may every spot be robbed, And quick relumed, the negro shade expelled.
Yet deem not thou from this, or aught besides,
The vision e'er can err:
its office sole Tells where is shine or shadow, while the rest, Whether the shining current live the same, Or change perpetual;
whether the dark shade Wait on each step progressive, or the dogm Just urged be truth,-all this the mind alone Weighs, and determines;
for th' exterior sight Scans not the powers of things;
so blame not thou Th' unerring vision for the mind's defects.
Th' advancing bark seems to the crew at rest;
At rest, advancing;
and the hills and vales, Near which we voyage, seem compelled astern.
Thus seem the stars, though reason proves their flight, Fixt to th' ethereal vault, o'er whose broad bounds
Their lucid course they steer, and rise and set Alternate ;
thus the sun and moon alike Move not to sight, though moving without end.
The mountain rocks, whose severed sides admit
Whole fleets between, look in the distant deep
But one continuous chain, one solid isle.
So to the wanton boy, whom many a twirl Makes dizzy, pillars, pictures, walls alike Roll rapid round, and menace with their fall.
When first the rosy dawn, with trembling fires, Peeps o'er the mountains, mountains where the sun Rests all his rising radiance,-the bright pomp Seems scarce two thousand bow-shots from ourselves;
Oft might five hundred reach it:
yet between
These rich-wrought mountains and the solar disc Spreads many an ocean, many a heaven unknown, Of span immense, and many a mighty realm Peopled with nations, and the brutal tribes.
So in the puny pools inch-high that fill, When showers descend, the hollows in our streets, A prospect opens, earth as deep below As bends o'er earth th' ethereal vault sublime:
Where may'st thou trace the flitting clouds, the heavens, And heavenly orbs in wondrous guise displayed.
Thus, too, when mounted on the mettled steed, Full in the stream then plunge,-if midway o'er Thou rest-the stationary steed seems still With the broad torrent struggling, up the tide Urging his dauntless chest, while all around With equal motion looks alike overpowered.
The pillared portico, whose aisle throughout
In breadth ne'er varies, propt through all its course With equal columns, from its entrance viewed Seems lessening gradual, side approaching side, And ceiling floor, till at its utmost bound All, like the cone, ends in a point acute.
To those at sea the restless sun ascends, And sets in ocean, quenching there his fires;
For nought but skies and ocean meet their view:
So blame not thou that thus the sight reports.
E'en while in port the bark, to those unskilled, Oft seems distrest, and with disabled arms Against the tide contending:
for though straight Looks the tough length of oar the brine above, And straight the helm superior, all below Seems broke abrupt, refracted by the wave, Inversed, and boating near the rory brim.
-When through the welkin the wild winds at night Drive the light clouds, the starry gems of heaven Seem forced athwart them, in perplext career Urged rapid on, wide wandering from their paths.
If but one eye-ball lightly thou compress Below, with casual finger, all around Looks instant double;
every taper flames With double lights, with double garniture
The mansion labours, and each friend assumes, Preposterous sight!
two faces, and two forms.
So, too, when sleep his opiate wand has stretched And lulled each limb in soft and sound repose, Still watchful seem we, every member still Feels in full motion:
wrapt in midnight gloom
The cheerful day still smiles:
though close pent up, O'er main, and mountains, hills and heavens we roam, Tread with firm foot the champaign ;
grave debates
Hear mid the noiseless solitude that reigns, And e'en while silent loudly make reply.
These, and a thousand visions, strange alike, Assault our senses, and would fain deceive.
But vain th' attempt:
since, though full oft we err, 'Tis mind misguides us with results unsound, That deeming seen which ne'er the sight surveys..
For nought more arduous than to sever forms True, from ideal by the mind begot.
Who holds that nought is known, denies he knows E'en this, thus owning that he nothing knows.
With such I ne'er could reason, who, with face Retorted, treads the ground just trod before.
Yet grant e'en this he knows;
since nought exists
Of truth in things, whence learns he what to know, Or what not know ?
what things can give him first
The notion crude of what is false, or true ?
What prove aught doubtful, or of doubt devoid ?
Search, and this earliest notion thou wilt find
Of truth and falsehood from the senses drawn, Nor aught can e'er refute them:
for what once, By truths opposed, their falsehood can detect, Must claim a trust far ampler than themselves.
Yet what than these an ampler trust can claim ?
Can reason, born forsooth of erring sense, Impeach those senses whence along it springs ?
And which, if false, itself can ne'er be true.
Can sight correct the ears ?
can ears the touch ?
Or touch the tongue's fine flavour ?
or, o'er all, Can smell triumphant rise ?
absurd the thought.
For every sense a separate function boasts, A power prescribed;
and hence or soft or hard, Or hot or cold, to its appropriate sense Alone appeals.
The gaudy train of hues, With their light shades, appropriate thus alike Perceive we;
tastes appropriate powers possess;
Appropriate, sounds and odours:
and hence, too, One sense another ne'er can contravene, Nor e'en correct itself;
since, every hour, In every act each claims an equal faith:
So what the senses notice must be true.-
E'en though the mind no real cause could urge
Why what is square when present, when remote Cylindric seems, 'twere dangerous less t' adopt A cause unsound, than rashly yield at once All that we grasp of truth and surety most, Rend all reliance, and root up, forlorn, The first, firm principles of life and health.
For not alone fails reason, life itself Ends instant, if the senses thou disturb;
And dare some dangerous precipice, or aught Against warned equal, spurning what is safe.
Hence all against the senses urged is vain, Mere idle rant, and hollow pomp of words.
As, in a building, if the first lines err, If aught impede the plummet, or the rule From its just angles deviate but a hair, The total edifice must rise untrue, Recumbent, curved, o’erhanging, void of grace, Tumbling, or tumbled from this first defect, So must all reason prove unsound, deduced From things created, if the senses err.
Thus perfect SIGHT, unfold we next, a task Not arduous, how each other sense perceives.
SOUND, and the VOICE, then, first are felt when deep Pierce their light corpuscles the mazy ear, And rouse impulsive;
for corporeal, too, Are sound and voice, since each the sense impels.
Thus voice full oft abrades the palate;
sound, Forth issuing from the lungs, th' aerial tube Roughens:
for when the vocal atoms press With throng unusual through the bronchial straits, Th' elastic stream their tender tunics goads, And the whole passage smarts with pain severe.
Hence, doubtless, voice and words sonorous spring From seeds corporeal, armed with power to wound.
Nor here forget how much the speaker wastes, How faints enervate, shorn of vital force, Who from the dawn harangues till night's black shade;
How doubly wastes if loud th' oration urged.
Corporeal, hence, the voice must prove, since he Who long debates, corporeal loss sustains.
Roughness, moreover, of voice, from atoms rough, From smooth its suavity perpetual flows:
Nor of like figure wind they through the ear
When roars the deep-toned trumpet, or the horn With hoarse, harsh gamut strains its serpent throat;
And when the swan, amid the pangs of death, Pours o'er PARNASSUS his last, liquid dirge.
The vocal tide thus reared, when from the lungs Sublime we press it through the bronchial duct, The tongue dædalian, and vivacious lips Mould it to words, articulated nice.
And when not far th' irruptive voice is thrown
It strikes emphatic, and is heard distinct, Unchanged, uninjured every primal seed.
But when at distance urged, the severing air Must break each sentence, and the wandering voice Through the long medium all connexion lose.
And thus, though sounds attract us, we collect Nought they should teach, so blended and destroyed.
When, mid the gaping throng, the crier loud Bawls out his mandate, each its purport hears.
Hence, too, the voice to vocicles minute Severs abrupt, since every ear alike Drinks in each tone with equal clearness felt;
While what its nerve ne'er reaches, wide diffused, Wastes through all ether;
or, if aught, perchance.
Strike some compact enclosure, it rebounds
In faithless speech, mere semblances of words.
Whence may'st thou solve, ingenuous !
to the world
The rise of echoes, formed in desert scenes, Mid rocks, and mountains, mocking every sound, When late we wander through their solemn glooms, And, with loud voice, some lost companion call.
And oft re-echoes echo till the peal Ring seven times round:
so rock to rock repels
The mimic shout, re-iterated close.
Here haunt the goat-foot satyrs, and the nymphs, As rustics tell, and fauns whose frolic dance
And midnight revels oft, they say, are heard Bicaking the noiseless silence;
while soft strains Melodious issue, and the vocal band Strike to their madrigals the plaintive lyre.
Such, feign they, sees the shepherd, obvious oft, Led on by PAN, with pine-leaf garland crowned, And seven-mouthed reed his labouring lip beneath, Waking the woodland MUSE with ceaseless song.
These, and a thousand legends wilder still Recount they;
haply lest their desert homes Seem of the gods abandoned, boastful hence
Of sights prodigious;
or by cause, perchance, More trivial urged, for ne'er was tale so wild Feigned, but the crowd would drink with greedy ears.
Nor strange, moreover, conceive it that the voice Full many a scene should pierce, the nerve of sound Rousing, where sight's keen gaze can never reach.
For voice unhurt through flexile tubes can wind;
But the light image never;
since the pore
When not direct, as that of lucid glass
Which all transmits, abrades it and destroys.
-Voice through the total scene, too, spreads alike;
Since, when once formed, to vocicles minute
It breaks innumerous, as sparks at night To countless sparklings;
hence the scene throughout O'erflows with sound, through every winding felt.
Yet visual images, when once propelled, Rush but in lines direct;
whence none can see Things pent above, though voice th' enclosure pierce.
Yet voice itself, thus piercing, faints obtuse, Heard indistinct, and rather sound than sense.
To TASTES proceed we:
whence the tongue's nice powers Spring, and the curious palate, full t' unfold.
-First tastes the tongue, then, when the sturdy teeth Wring from the food its juices ;
as though sponge, Pregnant with water, by th' embracing hand Were squeezed to dryness.
O'er the pores perplext
Of tongue and palate next th' excreted lymph Rushes amain;
and, when from atoms reared Smooth and rotund, the masticating sense Through its moist temple swells with dear delight:
But when the rough assail it, it recoils
And shrinks abhorrent, wounded in the strife.
Last, flows the trickling pleasure, or the pain, Back towards the tonsils where the gorge first opes ;
There flows and ceases, nothing felt beyond
Of joy or suffering through the frame diffused.
For nought imports it what the food employed, If but the stomach into genial tides Concoct it sole, and pour through every limb.
Oft find we, too, that various frames demand
As various viands;
and that what to some Seems harsh and hateful, some perpetual deem Delicious most;
while e'en so vast, at times, The strange discordance, that what poisons this To that proves healthful, and prolongates life.
Thus dies the snake that human spittle tastes, Worked into madness, self-destroyed ;
and thus Wild hellebore, that goats and quails matures, By man once swallowed stamps his instant fate.
These facts to solve, thy mind must first retrace A doctrine earlier urged, that all things hold Deep in their texture seeds unlike of form, And that each sentient class by food sustained, Since large the variance of its outer make, And stamp generic, must from nutrient seeds
Of form unlike be reared, and powers diverse.
But if its seeds thus differ, different too Must prove in shape the fine absorbent pores
Whence draws the frame its nurture, o'er the tongue Spread bibulous, the palate, and the limbs;
Now large, now small, triangular, rotund, Squares, polygons, in every changeful mode.
For to the varying seed the varying duct With nicest adaptation must respond.
And, hence, when foods of bitter taste to some Prove sweet to others, where the flavour charms, The smoothest seeds alone the palate drinks, Through all its pores inebriate;
while, reversed, Where aught offends, those jagged more and rough Pierce the nice tubes, and tear their tender mouths.
Thus all alike springs obvious.
When the frame, From bile o'erflowing, or some cause as fierce, Sickens with fever, every organ shakes With tumult dire, through all its texture changed.
Hence atoms erst apportioned, now no more Apportioned prove;
while those far readier fit That rouse the sense to hatred and disgust:
For both in all things lurk, as urged above, E'en in the sweets Hyblæan honey boasts.
But come, for ODOURS call us, and the powers
That sway th' obsequious nostrils.
Odours fine, Wave after wave, flow forth in ceaseless tide From many a substance, many a living tribe Attracting different, as diversely reared.
Hence bees, through distant ether, wind the scent
Of honeyed flowrets!
vultures, foul of maw, Track the vile carcass ;
the vivacious hound Hunts o'er the hills the cloven-footed foe ;
And the white goose, preserver of our state, The haunts explores of mortals.
Odours hence From odours differing, every brutal tribe Its food selects, from baneful poison flies, And through all time maintains its rank entire.
Thus varying scents the varying nostrils wound, To different distance urged;
yet none so far As voice or sounds, not here those films to name
That strike the pupil, and solicit sight.
For scents roam tardy, in uncertain path, And die with ease beneath the breath of heaven, Since from the depth of things with labour flung.
For that thus deep they rise thou thus may'st prove:
That all when frittered, into dust reduced, Or probed by fire, an ampler essence yield.
Then spring they, too, from particles more gross, Since void of power the firm flint wall to pierce, Pierced oft by sounds, by voices.
Doubtful hence
Feel we full frequent, though in scents immersed, From what point flows the perfume;
for the stream Chills as it loiters, and with languid force jxcites the dubious nostrils;
and hence, too, Oft the fleet pack wide wanders mid the chase.
Nor tastes alone, nor odours different strike
The different tribes percipient;
the light hues, The semblances of things, diversely, too, Pungent, or bland, the conscious sight assault.
The lion, thus, the cock's indignant eye Flies, nor can e'er encounter, loud of wing, Who drives the shadows, and the lazy dawn Wakes with shrill clarion iterated oft.
For seeds there are that in the warlike cock
Of power peculiar lurk, which when once urged Against the lion's sight, with wound severe
Tear the keen pupil;
whence the tortured beast Dares not the shock;
while yet the human eye Escapes uninjured, since the puny darts Pierce not, or, piercing, through the yielding pores Find a free entrance, and as free retire.
Now mark while briefly, next, the muse displays
What forms the mind excite, and through the soul Rush viewless.
First be this imprinted deep,
That light, innumerous semblances of things, Towards every point, in modes innumerous press, Combining soon through ether when they meet, As the wove woof of spiders, or the threads Fine-wrought of filmy gold.
For slenderer far Of these the texture than aught e'er that strikes Conspicuous on the pupil, since with ease Pierce they the porous body, reach, recluse, Th' attenuate mind, and stimulate the sense.
Hence Centaurs see we, Scyllas, and the face Of dogs Cerberean, or the spectres pale
Of those whose bones the tomb has long embraced.
For countless effigies of countless kinds Float vagrant round us, self-engendered, now In air sublime, now flung from all that lives, And now combined in many a monster form:
For the wild semblance of a Centaur yet Ne'er flowed from Centaurs living, nature such Creating never;
but when once in air A man's light image with a horse's meets, Quick they cohere, as just maintained, since reared Of subtlest texture, and the phantom springs.
Thus spring, too, kindred phantoms, by their make All volatile, and, with percussion joint, Rousing the mind, soon roused, since reared itself
Of subtlest texture, and vivacious most.
Thus all with ease developes.
As the mind Sees but the features sight surveyed before, Each into act some equal cause must prompt.-
Since the fierce lion, as the muse has taught, Sight, then, surveys from semblances alone, Nought but mere semblances the mind can rouse;
Hence seen the same, or but attenuate more.
Thus only, when the limbs dissolve in sleep, The wakeful spirit of the mind descries Trains of unreal objects, moved throughout
By the same images the day displays ;
So moved that those oft obvious seem to spring
Whom long the grave has folded in its grasp:
A creed e'en urged by nature, since, profound, Through the still frame then slumbers every sense, Void of all power to mark the true from false;
Nor rouses the dull memory to clear
The fancied scene, or prove the forms we see Erewhile fell victims to oblivious fate.
-Nor wondrous deem it that such forms should move, Or wave their hands, as dreams full oft disclose, Or trip their frolic feet to numerous time.
For the light image stays not, but flows on In streams successive;
hence when this to that Yields of diverse arrangement, from the change, Rapid as thought, the first seems moving sole.
So vast their powers of action ;
such the stores
Of things create, the countless phantoms such Flung through each moment's least capacious point.
Yet many a question themes like these excite, Deep thought demanding ere illumined clear.
Whence springs it that the mind, with instant haste, Thinks on whatever the wayward will resolves ?
If heaven the heart, if earth, or main, possess, Pomps, spectacles, or senates, feasts, or fights, Does NATURE then her images create Prompt to the moment ?
whence that mortals placed
In the same country, in the self-same spot, On different themes employ the thoughtful mind?
Whence, too, those graceful attitudes, in turn, The changeful phantoms oft in dreams disclose ?
The flexile arm that, through the measured dance, To arm voluptuous answers ?
and the foot
To foot symphonious, exquisitely true ?
Taste, then, the phantoms science?
are they taught
Thus loose to wanton mid the night's dead hours ?
Or flows it not much rather that each space
Of time minutest, e'en while the fleet lip Sounds but a syllable, of parts consists Minuter still, within whose rapid reign Rush they in swarms, towards every point propelled ?
So vast their powers of action ;
such the stores
Of things create.
And hence when this to that Yields of diverse arrangement, from the change
The first alone seems moving to the sight.
Then, too, so fine their texture, that the mind, Save when profound it pries, their separate forms Can ne'er distinguish;
hence, unnoticed, waste
Those the dull mind prepares not to survey.
For thus prepares it ceaseless, and expects
The coming vision, hence surveyed alone.
E'en seest thou not the pupil, when it first Kens some fine object, all its orb contracts, And strains ere yet the figure full disclose ?
Thus, too, in scenes more obvious, if thy soul Thou bend not to the vision, it remains
As though from thee far distant and disjoined.
What wonder each light image, then, should die Viewless, the mind ne'er rouses to survey.
Then things minute, too, large full oft we deem Wide wandering from the fact, and self-deceived.
And oft a form the present phantom wears
Unlike th' anterior, woman now, and now The bolder sex, or shaped with different age, And features fresh, while still oblivion deep, And languid rest restrain us from surprise.
Yet fly abhorrent, here, with vigour fly
Their creed who hold that every organ sprang
To use self-destined:
that the pupil rose Conscious of vision;
that the legs, the thighs
On the firm foot upreared their columns, versed Previous in paces ;
that the flexile arm Hence nerved with strength its muscles;
and the hands Hung on each side, the messengers of life.
This, and whatever such sophists else affirm, Is futile all, preposterous, and wild.
For nought so knows its office as to act
When first produced, but all produced alone Learns it progressive.
The nice power to see Lived not before the eye-ball;
to debate With graceful speech before the tongue was formed, The tongue long first created ;
nor to hear Ere rose the sense of sound;
nor aught besides
Of organ could anticipate its use.
Hence urged by use, no organ ever sprang.
Wars, we admit, with all their ills, began, And savage blows were dealt, and tides of blood Flowed forth obscene, ere yet the lucid spear Was hurled indignant;
and to fly its force Preceded long the left hand's sturdy shield.
Thus, too, repose the weary members claimed, Long ere the down displayed its soft expanse;
And the parched lip was slaked ere goblets rose.
Doubtless such instruments from use foreseen
Were gradual framed, as life and nature called, But nought besides;
for all created else First sprang, and then their proper use explored, The senses chief, and active limbs of man.—
Hence far the creed reject, then, that affirms
These e'er produced from office pre-conceived.
Nor is it wondrous that each form that breathes Should, from its nature, need diurnal food :
Since, as we erst have taught, in many a mode Full many an atom flies from all create;
From ranks percipient most, by toil fatigued.
For ceaseless vapour here the skin bedews, Flung forth profound, and quick the labouring lungs Part with their vital spirit;
hence the frame Sinks all exhausted ;
faintness preys profuse
O'er every power, and ruin stares around.
So foods are claimed the languid limbs to brace, To fill with strength recruited, and appease
The craving hunger that subdues the soul.
So, too, the goblet spreads its liquid stores
Where'er those stores are sought, with grateful draught Quenching the fiery stomach, and absorbed Through all the members, freshening as it flows.
Hence dies the raging hunger ;
and the thirst, Panting no more, is drowned in fluent bliss.
Now next unfold we, thou the doctrine mark, How the firm foot advances at our will ?
Whence draw the lips their motion ?
and within
What this strange power the body's bulk that drives ?
—First, then, we hold-a precept urged before-
That the light images that rove around Beset, and strike the mind ;
hence springs the will Determined instant;
for no mortal aught Can e'er commence but what th' interior mind Wills, and decides;
and what the mind thus wills
Th' assailing image governs by its form.
So when the mind, thus roused, resolves to walk, Quick through the total soul, the soul diffused O'er all the system, the commotion felt
It spreads percussive, spreads with instant ease, Since close the bond between them;
and, in turn.
Urged by the soul, the body final moves, Feels the propulsion, and its power obeys.
Then, too, the frame expands, and the light air All volatile, through every path, and pore, Each aperture minutest, ampler flows ;
And hence from two-fold force, as sails the bark With wind and canvass, man majestic moves.
Nor strange conceive it that such trivial powers
Should turn the body, and its bulk direct.
For the pure gale, of subtlest atoms reared, With force immense the mightiest ship propels;
While one light hand, one slender helm, with ease Guides its vast burden o'er the bending main.
And, armed with wheels, and pulleys, the firm crane Lifts loads at will, the groaning ground that crush.
Now by what means soft SLEEP bedews the limbs, And from the mind drives every carking care, This next the muse in melodies shall sing More sweet than prolix;
as the swan's lone dirge Flows forth superior to the clamorous croak
Of countless cranes, by every wind disperst.
Hear thou attentive, and with mind acute, Lest aught appear incongruous, and thy breast Recoil abhorrent from the truths we teach, Foe to the creed from ignorance alone.
Sleep, then, occurs when fades through every limb
The soul's sensorial power, part by fatigue Wasted through ether, and concentred part Deep in each vital organ ;
till, at length, Lax grow the members, listless, and dissolved.
For power sensorial doubtless from the soul Derives;
and hence, when sleep the senses locks, Th' enfeebled soul itself to reason seems Worn out, and all ejected into air.
Yet not entire:
for then this mortal make Must sink subdued in death's eternal ice, No latent atom left, as sparks that lurk
In smothered embers, whence its powers afresh Might blaze, triumphant, with recovered flame.
Yet by what means this wondrous change results, Whence fails the soul, and all the body droops, Now mark, nor let the dictates waste in air.
Know then all ether, that around us flows, Beats on the body, open to its force, With ceaseless repercussion.
Nature hence,
To check its fury, oft the tender frame With skin surrounds, hair, bark, or painted shells.
Nor ceases here th' assault;
the breeze inhaled Winds, too, through all the system, and each duct Lashes amain with every fleeting breath.
Since with a two-fold foe, then, Nature, thus, Through all her depths, through all her pores minute, Strives ceaseless, ruin by degrees must threat:
For each primordial seed is deep deranged Of mind and body:
while th' enfeebled soul, By transudation shorn, concentrates part
In the deep vitals, and in part still roams Through all the limbs distracted seed from seed Severed, to join all powerless, or resume
Their wonted action ;
hence each varying sense, The fount sensorial failing, must itself Fail too abrupt, the total body droop, The limbs grow languid, listless hang the hands, Totter the knees, and the faint eye-lids fall.
Thus food, alike, when through the frame it pours
Its stream salubrious, since the toiling air It mocks in action, slumber too excites.
And heavier far his sleep whom diet full, Or long fatigue overpowers, for ampler, then, Th' intestine labour, and the soul flies off Ampler external;
while the remnant shrinks Profounder part, and part through every limb Strays more distracted, of all bond devoid.
Thus slumber issues ;
and whatever the thoughts
That chief subdue us, the concerns that claim
Our ceaseless care, or what the mind explores With patient pause, in dreams we still pursue.
The lawyer, thus, o'er briefs and statutes pores;
New wars the soldier wages;
with the winds Strives the vain mariner ;
while we the laws
Of nature scan perpetual, and how best, When traced, to paint them in our native tongue.
So various lores beside, and arts diverse Haunt, oft, in sleep the cheated mind of man.
He who from eve to eve, assiduous, long Has marked the public stage, though now no more
It strikes his senses, through his porous frame Still the light images admits that float Countless around him.
Hence, for many a day, E'en while awake, the scene before his eyes Seems still renewed ;
the light-deckt dancers move
Their modulated limbs, the living lyre
He hears entranced, from every fluent string Speaking impassioned;
he the throng surveys, And all the pageantry the drama boasts..
Of such vast import are the plans pursued, The thoughts indulged, the customs deep impressed Of man not merely, but of brutes as well.
For the nerved steed, as o'er the glebe he lies, Oft sweats, and pants laborious in his sleep, As though amain contending for the palm.
So, too, the hound, amid his soft repose, Oft starts abrupt, and howls, and snuffs the breeze With ceaseless nostrils, as though full at hand He tracked the antlered trembler.
And, at times, E'en while awake, with vigour he pursues Vain semblances of deer as though themselves Started before him, till the phantoms void Vanish at length, and truth regain her sway.
E'en the soft lap-dog his inglorious sleep Breaks not unfrequent, rousing all erect, Urged by the semblance of some face unknown.
And as of harsher seeds the trains are formed
Of floating phantoms, with augmented force Strike they the mind.
Hence birds, with flight abrupt, Oft to the centre of the sacred groves
At midnight hurry, in their dreams disturbed By hideous sight of hawks, on outstretched wing, Prowling aloft all active for the pounce.
Then what vast toils engage men when asleep!
How pants the mind beneath superb exploits !
Kings strive with kings in combat;
or at large Contend, surrender, pour the cries of death;
While some fight on, though wounded, loading still All heaven with groans, as though to atoms torn
By some huge lion, or remorseless pard.
Some, too, aloud their machinations tell, And thus in sleep full oft themselves accuse.
Some on their death-bed seem;
and some to leap
Headlong from precipices ;
by the fright Awoke, of reason so bereft, the mind Scarce with the day resumes its wonted reign.
While, oft, the dreamer, all athirst, overhangs Some joyous stream, and drinks the total tide.
So boys asleep, too, deeming near at hand
The public sewer, or close appropriate vase, Oft lift their skirts the native brine t' eject, And stain with saffron all the purple bed.
* * * * * * *WHO, from his burning breast, a strain may strike Meet for the boundless majesty of things ?
Things now developed ?
who, in words alone, May pour forth praises worthy his desert
Whose matchless mind such wonders first disclosed ?
No mortal, doubtless.
For, of things explored, Such the majestic dignity, the sage Must, so to speak, have been a god indeed:
A god, illustrious MEMMIUS !
he who first
The rules of life devised, now termed by all, Sole, solid WISDOM ;
he whose happy art From such wild waves, such shades of ten-fold night Leads us to truth, tranquillity, and day.
What are to him the gods of earlier times ?
CERES, who taught the fruits of earth to rear, As fame reports ? or BACCHUS, first who stole
The vine's purpureal spirit ?
foods mankind Without may flourish, and, through many a clime, This moment know not;
but of virtue void, And purity of heart, man ill can thrive.
Hence ampler far his claim to rites divine
Whose dulcet solaces whole nations feel, Soothing the wounded spirit as they flow.
Should'st thou with him e'en HERCULES compare, Famed for exploits, from reasonfar thou err'st.
For what were now to us, with all their threats, NEMÆA’S lion, or th' ARCADIAN boar ?
The bull of CRETE, or hydra-headed snake
That reared, o'er LERNA'S banks, his dreadful fangs ?
Or what to us the triple-breasted strength Of three-faced GERYON, or the horses wild Of DIOMED, o'er ISMARA, and THRACE, And all BISTONIA, snorting ceaseless fire ?
What woes could these now menace ?
or the birds
With huge, uncleanly talons that defiled
The climes of ARCADY ?
or, feller still, ThR enormous dragon that, with eye severe, Clung round the tree of vegetable gold, And in HESPERIA kept the glittering fruit ?
How now could such affect us ?
fixt remote
O'er boundless beas, beyond th' ATLANTIC shores.
Where nevei mortal else, refined or rude, Dared urge his desperate sail ?
E'en though alive, Unconquered still, from monsters such as these
What need we dread ?
Nought, doubtless, or I err.
For savage monsters crowd the world e'en now, Fearful and gaunt;
and hills, and groves remote, And pathless woods re-echo to their roar;
Scenes, still, our feet with ease may ever shun.
But, with the mind unpurged, what tumults dire, What dangers inly rage!
what hosts of cares, From various lusts, convulse the total manI
What terrors throng !
what dread destruction flows
From pomp, pride, passion, indolence, and vice!
He, then, that these o'erpowers, and from the breast Drives, not by arms, but precepts sage and pure-
Say-ought not this man with the gods to rank ?
Since of themselves, too, and in strain divine, Much to the race of mortals he disclosed, And oped the nature of created things.
His steps I follow;
and, by him illumed, Unlock the laws whence first the world uprose;
Laws that still guide it, and to utmost time Will guide resistless;
whence the human soul Was stampt corporeal, impotent to live Age after age triumphant o'er decay, Proving that nought but phantoms cheat the mind, When oft in sleep we deem the dead appear.
What then, in order, waits us but to sing How Nature's perishable system sprang, As sure of fate as erst of natal hour;
How, from the mass material, heaven and earth, Sun, moon, and stars, harmonious swelled to life ;
What animated tribes, from age to age, Have peopled space, and what have never lived:
Whence man, in various tongues, the power possessed
Of naming all surveyed;
whence the deep fear, Felt through the soul, of potentates divine, Urging the nations to the culture dread Of lakes, groves, altars, images, and fanes.
Ours, too, the task to show how Nature bends, With power presiding, the reluctant sun And moon through all their courses;
lest thou deem
These of themselves, 'twixt heaven and earth, fulfil Their ceaseless rounds;
renewing, as they roll, Fruits, and the sentient tribes;
or hold the gods Guide the vast frame, unwearied, and unseen.
For he who j ustly deems th' immortals live Safe, and at ease, yet fluctuates in his mind How things are swayed, how chiefly those discerned
In heaven sublime,-to superstition back Lapses, and rears a tyrant host, and, then, Conceives, dull reasoner !
they can all things do;
While yet himself nor knows what may be done
Nor what may never;
nature powers defined Stamping on all, and bounds that none can pass.
First, to delay no more then, we maintain
That earth, air, ocean, these stupendous scenes, These triple bodies so diversely reared, These, MEMMIUS!
these one common day shall doom
To utter ruin;
when, for ages propt, The world’s vast system shall itself dissolve.
Nor hid from me how new the creed we teach, How wondrous to the mind, that heaven and earth Should perish ever;
or how hard the task
By words alone such tenets to confirm.
For thus thou e'er wilt find it when thy tongue
Opes some fresh subject sight has ne'er surveyed, Nor touch developed, the main roads belief Treads to the breast, and temple of the mind. < Yet will I strive;
facts, haply, shall themselves
Aid me, and thou the world's vast fabric own
By dread convulsions shortly must be shook.
May fortune's smile this hour from us avert!
And truth, not feeling, the tremendous roar Teach, with which all to ruin then shall rush !
Yet on this theme before the muse unlock
Her mystic treasures, sager and more true
Than e'er the PYTHIAN maid, with laurels crowned, Spoke from the tripod at APOLLO'S shrine,- Some salutary precepts would I add, Lest, chained by superstition, thou should'st deem Heaven, earth, and ocean, sun, moon, stars exist Gods in their frame, and of eternal date, And fear for those the vengeance that pursued
The race gigantic, who, with lettered lore, Shake the world's walls, the radiant eye of heaven Quench, and th' immortals sketch in mortal terms.
For these, so far from arrogating, proud, Celestial honours, and the rank of gods, Full proof exhibit, rather, how devoid Of vital action matter may exist, And that not every compound frame alike Boasts the high powers of intellect and mind.
Trees not in ether, not in ocean clouds, Nor in the fields can fishes e'er exist;
Nor blood in planks, nor vital juice in stones;
But all springs definite in scenes defined..
So in the bosom lives, and there alone, Mixt with its blood and nerves, the secret mind.
There only lives;
for, could it roam at all, Then rather should we through the body's self, The heel or shoulder, or where else it chose, Oft trace it wandering than forlorn abroad.
Since, e'en in body then, the soul and mind Are fixt thus definite, we amply prove
That out of body, and a reasoning frame, In putrid glebes of earth, or solar fire, In air, or water, sense can never dwell.
And hence these ne'er divinity can boast, Since e'en devoid of animated life.
Nor deem the sacred mansion of the gods
O'er aught extend of this material frame:
For their immortal nature, far removed From human sense, from matter gross and dull Scarce by the mind's pure spirit can be traced.
Hence, as no touch of matter these can reach, Their finer textures never can impress Material objects for whate'er exists Intangible, itself can never touch.
And, thus, th' immortal regions must from ours
Wide vary, congruous to their purer frames:
As soon the muse in ampler verse shall prove.
T’ assert moreover the gods for mortal man Reared this vast fabric, and that duty, hence, Bids us extol the workmanship divine, Deem it.
immortal, and of deathless date,
And that most impious is it to arraign Aught thus constructed by the gods themselves From earliest time, for man's perpetual use ;
Most impious, though in words alone, to shake
The world's firm basis,-such conceits to feign, To talk thus idly, MEMMIUS, is to rave.
For what vast gain can e'er th' immortal powers, Blest in themselves, from human praise derive
To rouse them in our favour ?
what new hope, Such ages after of unsullied peace, Could tempt them once to linger for a change ?
New scenes to welcome, joyless proves the past;
But where no ill can rise, where every hour, Age after age, propitious still must glide, How can the breast here burn for what is new ?
Dragged they their lives in darkness, then, and woe Till sprang th' illumined world ?
or, if ne'er born,
What cause could man have marshalled for complaint ?
Born, it behoves him, doubtless, to remain
In life while life one blessing can afford;
But what of vital joy ne'er tasted, ne'er Ranked with the living, how can such object, And with what reason, that it ne'er was formed?
Whence could the gods the model, too, deduce
Of things create, the portraiture of man ?
Or in their minds how first the notion spring ?
Whence, too, the powers of atoms could they learn, Changing their act as in position changed, If nature ne'er the visual world had reared ?
Atoms, innumerous, that in countless modes, From time eternal have been so convulsed By repercussions, by intrinsic weight So urged and altered, and, in every form Combined, evincing still some action new, In every mass some effort to create, That nought stupendous seems it they, at length, Should gain those stations, those connexions gain, Whence sprang th' Entire of all things, and subsists.
E'en though the rise of things I ne'er could prove, Yet dare I, from the heaven's defective frame, And many a scene alike perverse, affirm No power divine this mass material reared With ills so gross, so palpable to sight.
First, all beneath th' ethereal cope's wide whirl
What hills rapacious rise !
what woods beset
With tribes ferocious !
what uncultured rocks !
How stretch the stagnant lakes, of life devoid,
And the vast main that severs shore from shore!
Then torrid heat, too, and perpetual frost Shut from mankind near half the solid earth.
While what of glebe remains, from power innate
So throngs with briers, human art can scarce
The growth restrain;
by love of life led on O'er the tough spade, or delving plough to groan :
For if the share we thrust not through the soil, Subjecting earth, and rearing for ourselves
The stores demanded, birth were never theirs.
Yet e'en, at times, when, sought by long fatigue, With flowers and foliage laughs the total scene, Th' ethereal sun with rage untempered burns, Or showers abrupt destroy, or biting frosts, Or the wild winds with winnow too severe.
And why, moreover, in ocean, or on earth, Does nature nourish, and the tribes augment
Of savage brutes and monsters ?
why renew Diseases with the seasons ?
and with deaths Green and untimely thin the race of man ?
Then the poor babe, too, like a sea-man wrecked Thrown from the waves, lies naked o'er the ground, Weakly and void of every vital aid, When nature first, amid his mother's pangs, Casts the young burden on the realms of light;
And leaves to pine full sore, as well he may, That e'er the suffering lot of life were his.
While herds, meantime, and beasts of various name, Flourish at ease;
no rattles they require, No broken lullaby of dandling nurse, Nor varying dress adapted to the day:
Nor arms they need, nor garners to protect Their hoarded treasures, earth and nature boon To each acceding every latent wish.
And since earth, ocean, heat's redundant stream, And the light spirits of the gentle airs, Whence chief the world is reared, of frames consist Create and mortal, mortal and create Must, too, the total world itself be deemed.
For where we see the separate parts of things
Of figures formed, now rising, now destroyed, There see we, too, the mass those parts compose Must have alike an origin and end.
So, where we view the world's chief members rise, And waste alternate, heaven and earth we hold Erst was created and must soon decay.
Nor here, 0 MEMMIUS !
unconfirmed by proof Deem we maintain that earth, or ether pure, Moisture or heat, are perishable all;
Reviving still, and urged to growth mature.
For much of earth perpetual suns to dust Burn most impalpable;
and much the tread
Of ceaseless traffic into clouds compels, Blown by the winds o'er all the void of heaven.
While part, if glebe, the rushing rains dissolve, Or restless tides, if formed of bank abrupt..
Whatever, moreover, some other substance feeds Itself must waste proportioned ;
whence, since earth
The common parent lives, and grave of all, She, too, alike must dwindle and augment.
Then that the fountains, floods, and boundless main Swell with new waters from perpetual springs, Words need not prove;
the lavish streams that flow Still undiminished, turn where'er we may, This, of themselves, demonstrate ;
while above Mounts all excess attenuate as it forms.
For part the bickering winds brush ceaseless, part
The sun exhales ethereal, and through earth Part still retreats, and, percolated pure, Fresh bubbles distant at some fountain-head:
Whence winds again the dulcet tide through paths Its liquid feet have printed oft before.
To air now turn we, varying every hour
In every mode:
for all that pours profuse From things perpetual, the vast ocean joins
Of air sublime;
which if to things again Paid not, thus balancing the loss sustained, All into air would dissipate and die.
Hence, born from things, to things air still returns Ceaseless, as prove their fluctuating forms.
Then, too, th' ethereal sun, exhaustless fount
Of liquid light, all heaven with flame bedews, And pours o'er lustre lustre ever new.
For, fall where'er it may, th' impinging beam Dies in the contest instant.
This full clear See we, whene'er by interposing clouds,
The solar disc is blotted, and its rays Fractured abrupt;
for the bright stream below Then fades, and all the sickening scene is shade.
Hence may'st thou learn that things for ever claim New radiance, and that every wave propelled Wastes instantaneous-while alone survives Perpetual shine from rays perpetual poured.
So from our earthly lights, too, trimmed at eve, The pendant lamp, the taper, or the torch Flaring bituminous through clouds of smoke, Stream new-born lustres from their several fires With brandish ceaseless, ceaseless or the scene Would instant frown with discontinuous blaze.
So rapid rush they !
such the headlong speed
With which the present triumphs o'er the past.
So sun, moon, stars alike are deemed t' eject, Birth after birth, still fresh-engendered rays, Glittering through time with light that never lives.
E'en seest thou not how stones themselves decay ?
How turrets totter, and the rigid rock Crumbles in time to dust ?
how yield, at length, Fanes, altars, images by age worn out ?
Nor can the gods resist th' impending fate, Or war with nature.
Moulder not, moreover, The marble tombs of heroes ?
as though each Sought, like the form it clasps, an early end.
And rush not oft huge crags, from mountain heights Hurled headlong, powerless to resist the rage
Of finite time ?
for had they nourished firm From time eternal, they had flourished still.
View this vast concave that above, around, Folds all creation in its mighty grasp;
This whence, as some tell, all first rose, and where All shall at last return-this too exists Create and mortal;
for whatever augments Aught else, and nurtures, must itself decrease, Repaired alone by matters re-absorbed.
Yet grant this heaven, this earth the heaven surrounds, Time ne'er produced, eternal of themselves-
Whence ere the THEBAN war, and fate of TROY, Have earlier bards no earlier actions sung ?
Whence fell each chief unhonoured ?
and his deeds
Shut from the tablet of immortal fame ?
But, or I err, the world's vast scope exists New from its nature, and of recent birth:
For many a liberal art now first unfolds,
And much is still progressive;
genius much, E'en at this hour, to navigation adds;
Nor minstrels long have struck the dulcet lyre:
While the vast science of the RISE OF THINGS Throughout is novel;
and, among the first, I first aID numbered who the lore devised, And taught its dictates in our native tongue.
Yet should'st thou deem that all things erst ensued
As now, but that the race of men unknown, With all their records, conflagrations dire Swept from the world, or earthquakes deep ingulfed, Or floods, rapacious from perpetual rains, Drowned, and their towns and citadels dissolved:
Then flows it doubly thou must own, convinced, That heaven and earth hereafter may decay.
For since such woes, such dangers can assail Created things, when once the cause augments Perdition boundless must perforce ensue.
Nor by aught else can we ourselves decide Mortal, but that with maladies we droop 1 Like those whom NATURE ceaseless calls from life.
What lives immortal, too, must so exist
Or from its own solidity, empowered Each blow to conquer, undivided still
As primal atoms, long anterior sung;
Or since, like vacuum, of all friction void, Free from all touch, by impulse unimpaired;
Or from the want of circling space in which
The severing atoms may dissolve and fall:
Such want the boundless whole of nature proves, And hence eternal, for no place beyond Spreads where its seeds could waste;
nor from without Can foreign force e'er enter to destroy.
But nor, as urged above, exists the world All solid, since in all things void combines, Nor yet all vacuum ;
nor, from the profound, Are wanting powers adverse that, into act Once roused tempestuous, may the world derange, Or sever total;
nor deficient space Spread widely round, through which, in countless modes, The frame mundane may crumble and dissolve;
Hence not precluded from the gates of death
Is heaven, or earth, or sun, or main immense, Gates in full view, unfolded wide to each.
Hence too, since mortal, each alike exists
Of frame created;
for no mortal make Could, from eternal time, the rage have borne
Of countless ages urgent to devour.
And since, moreover, the world's vast members strive
In ruthless war, contending each with each, Seest thou not clear some final shock must soon Decide the contest ?
that the fiery sun Perchance may conquer, and each flood drink up Till nought survive ;
as oft disposed he seems;
Yet idly.
For so vast the stores supplied From springs perpetual, such the boundless main, A daily deluge threats us;
yet alike Threats us in vain ;
for much the winnowing winds
Skim from the surface, and th' ethereal sun Such draughts exhales insatiate, that the world With drought than deluge rather must expire:
So strive they equal, so with powers alike Pant for the lists.
And hence, as fame reports, Flame triumphed once, and once the boisterous waves Leaped o'er their boundaries, and the world ingulfed.
Flame triumphed, and the total orb was fire
When the wild fury of the solar steeds
Whirled through the heavens, and o'er th' astounded earth Ill-fated PHAETON, whom, deep-incensed, Almighty JOVE hurled headlong from the skies, While PHŒBUS caught th' eternal lamp, restrained Abrupt the trembling coursers, reined afresh, And into peace re-organized the world.
So feign the bards of GREECE, devoid alike Of truth and reason.
Yet the power of fire Doubtless might triumph, should the fiery seeds Collect too largely from th' abyss of things:
When or some fiercer force their rage must quell, Or the red siroc burn the world to dust.
Thus, too, th' insurgent waters once o’erpowered, As fables tell, and deluged many a state;
Till, in its turn, the congregated waves
By cause more potent conquered, heaven restrained Its ceaseless torrents, and the floods decreased.
But from this boundless mass of matter first
How heaven, and earth, and ocean, sun, and moon, Rose in nice order, now the muse shall tell.
For never, doubtless, from result of thought, Or mutual compact, could primordial seeds First harmonize, or move with powers precise.
But countless crowds in countless manners urged, From time eternal, by intrinsic weight, And ceaseless repercussion, to combine
In all the possibilities of forms, Of actions, and connexions, and exert In every change some effort to create-
Reared the rude frame at length, abruptly reared, Which, when once gendered, must the basis prove
Of things sublime ;
and whence eventual rose Heaven, earth, and ocean, and the tribes of sense.
Yet now nor sun on fiery wheel was seen Riding sublime, nor stars adorned the pole, Nor neaven, nor earth, nor air, nor ocean lived, Nor aught of prospect mortal sight surveys;
But one vast chaos boisterous, and confused.
Yet order hence began;
the mingled mass Unveiled its various powers ;
congenial parts Parts joined congenial;
and the rising world Gradual evolved:
its mighty members each From each divided, and matured complete From seeds appropriate;
whose wild discord erst, Reared by their strange diversities of form, With ruthless war so broke their proper paths, Their motions, intervals, conjunctions, weights, And repercussions, nought of genial act Till now could follow, nor the seeds themselves, E'en though conjoined, in mutual bond cohere.
Thus air, secreted, rose o'er labouring earth;
Secreted, ocean flowed;
and the pure fire, Secreted too, towards ether sprang sublime.
But first the seeds terrene, since ponderous most, And most perplext, in close embraces clung, And towards the centre conglobating sunk.
And, as the bond grew firmer, ampler forth Pressed they the fluent essences that reared Sun, moon, and stars, and main, and heaven's high walls.
For these of atoms lighter far consist, Subtler, and more rotund than those of earth.
Whence, from the pores terrene, with foremost haste Rushed the bright ether, towering high, and swift Streams of pure fire attracting as it flowed.
Not differing wide from what full oft we view
When, at the dawn, the golden-tressed sun Flames o'er the meadows rich with rory gems, And from the mountains, lakes, and teeming glebes, Draws many a vapour;
which, when once aloft
By the chill air condensed, to clouds concretes, And with its filmy drapery veils the heavens.
So the light ether, as from every point Fluent it rose, concreted, and a bound Gradual assumed, and, thus assuming, grasped In its vast compass all th' evolving world.
Then mounted, next, the base of sun, and moon, 'Twixt earth and ether, in the midway air, Rolling their orbs;
for into neither these Could blend harmonious, since too light with earth To sink deprest, while yet too ponderous far To fly with ether towards the realms extreme:
So 'twixt the two they hovered;
vital there Moving for ever, parts of the vast whole;
As move for ever in the frame of man Some active organs, while some oft repose.
These from the mass discharged, much next of eartu Subsided sudden, and the gulf disclosed
Where ocean rolls his blue and briny tide.
And as th' ethereal gas, and solar blaze Flowed more profuse, and lashed, with ceaseless rage, The porous surface, firmer thus condensed Towards its own centre, the corrosive lymph Ampler transuded;
and with livelier streams Filled the wide hollow of the liquid plains:
And ampler, too, th' attenuate textures rushed Of air, and fire, and, borne on swifter wing, High reared the radiant temples of the sky.
Low sunk the vales, the mountains still sublime Stood, for no power their rocky base could shake, Nor equal settled e'en the softer soils.
So all was formed :
the ponderous bulk of earth Concentred close, and to the lowliest base Fell, the foul faeces of th' unfolding world:
While ocean, air, and ether filled with fire, Sprang from the remnant atoms more refined.
Yet these, too, differed;
for, though liquid all, And light, yet ether far the rest surpassed, Most light, most liquid, and in heaven sublime Hence loftiest towered it, never mingling once With the rude tumults of the lowlier air:
For whirlwinds this, and wayward tempests, oft, Shatter abrupt, while ether glides through time
In one smooth course, and bears its fires along ;
As flows th' undevious EUXINE, and preserves One ceaseless tenor, limpid and serene.
How move the stars, now next the muse shall sing.
And first, if heaven's vast orb we deem revolve Round the fixt earth, some subtle gas, perchance, Bounds it on all sides, and with two-fold stream, Whirls round its poles;
the current urged above Steering the course the gliding planets point, Themselves hence soon propelled;
while that below Flows adverse, and the nether sphere drives on, As drives the tide the mill's unwearied wheel.
Yet, if unmoved the heavenly orb we deem, Its fires may still revolve:
some restless seeds
Of all-elastic ether, close pent up, Panting for ease, may agitate their balls, And round the sky's refulgent concave whirl.
Or air absorbed extrinsic may, alike, With restless rage compel them;
or themselves Each choose his various path as food invites, Their lucid lamps recruiting through the heavens.
But of these causes which in this world rules 'Tis hard t' affirm ;
whence rather here we teach What through th' ENTIRE OF NATURE may subsist Mid various worlds to various models framed, And strive t' unfold whate'er may haply bend, In different systems, different stars, than aught Assign precise for either.
One alone Of those now numbered, one sole cause propels
The stars of earth, but which that cause the sage
Yet dares not name, who treads with cautious foot.
But, that this mass terrene might hold unmoved
The world's mid regions, its excess of weight, From its own centre downwards, gradual ceased;
And all below a different power assumed From earliest birth, a nature more attuned To the pure air on which it safe reposed.
Hence earth to air no burden proves, nor deep Grinds it with pressure;
as the limbs no load Feel to the body, to the neck no weight Th' incumbent head, nor e'en the total form Minutest labour to the feet below:
While yet each foreign substance, though but light, Grieves oft severely instant as imposed;
So vast th' importance things their like should join.
For from a distance earth was never brought, And into air at once abruptly hurled;
But both sprang equal when the world first rose, Each part of each as limb with limb combines.
When, too, with thunder shake the realms above Earth feels the dread concussion, and rebounds;
Effect which ne'er could flow did nought of tie Bind it to ether, and the world of air:
For each to each, as with commingled roots, Cleave from their birth, congenial, and conjoined.
Seest thou not, ceaseless, how th' attenuate soul Bears up the ponderous body, since alike Conjoined, congenial;
when the total frame Leaps up abrupt, whence flows the salient force
But from the soul the members that commands ?
Seest thou not hence, then, what the subtlest power May compass when with ponderous frames conjunct, As earth with air, or with the body mind ?
Nor less, nor larger much the solar wheel Measures than meets the view:
far be the space
Of utmost length through which aught igneous throws Its liquid heat, its lustre o'er the limbs, While these yet reach us it can ne'er so far Lie that the distance should curtail its size.
Since, then, the sun flings down his fires, profuse, His light on all things, he must still exist Nor less, nor larger than the vision views.
Thus too the moon, shine she with borrowed blaze, Or pour essential splendour from herself, Moves with the magnitude the sight surveys.
For all discerned through tracts of air remote Grows first confused and indistinct of form Ere yet its size diminish;
but the moon, Since traced precise through e'en her utmost orb, Must prove the sphere the sight descries sublime.
Th' ethereal stars, moreo'er—since lights terrene Receding gradual, while they yet maintain
Their lambent fires, their radiance unimpaired, Scarce obvious dwindle,-must themselves alike
In size scarce vary from the form they show.
Nor deem it strange that so minute a sun Should pour forth flame sufficient heaven to fill, And earth, and ocean, and whatever exists Tinge with its glittering dew;
for, from abroad
The myriad seeds of fire dispersed at large Through all things, here as to their fountain flow, And hence well forth o'er all th' exulting world
In boundless flood:
seest thou how small a spring Feeds with its liquid treasures meads, full oft, Of amplest breadth, and all their glebe overflows ?
Or the small globe of solar flame, perchance, Th' effusive air may fire, than aught besides Ignited easier by th' impinging ray;
As oft some casual spark the field inflames
Of full-ripe corn, or stubble crisp and sear.
Or haply stores, impalpable to sight, Of latent heat the rosy lamp surround, Whence amply draws it its eternal blaze.
Nor trace we clear by what unvarying law, When summer fades, the sun his downward path Bends towards the wintry goat, and thence, in turn, Reclimbs the heavens, and, from the red crab, pours
The sultry solstice;
or, why seems the moon O'er the same space to voyage every month The toiling sun claims twelve t' achieve complete.
These nought unfolds decisive;
for the dogm Of sage DEMOCRITUS we, first, may deem Haply efficient, that the radiant signs, As nearer earth affixed, less rapid far Roll in the heaven's vast whirlpool, heaven below Gradual its race relaxing;
whence the sun And solar satellites must more and more Be backwards left, deserted, since full deep Lie they beneath the blue ethereal fires:
While the bright moon lies deeper still, and hence Still powerless more, as nearer earth's low bounds, To match the speed the loftier signs display.
As tardier moves she in her proner path
Than moves the sun, as swifter o'er her rolls
The wondrous vortex of sublimest heaven.
Whence seems she speedier through each sign t' advance, While o'er herself each sign but fleeter flies.
Or different airs, perchance, at times defined, Rush o'er the converse hemispheres of earth;
This the moon driving from the summer fires Down towards the wintry arc, and realms of ice;
And that, alternate, raising her again From frost's drear solstice to the sultry signs.
Thus moves the sun too, haply, and the stars Alternate thus, by converse airs propelled, Roll their vast rounds, and fill the mighty year.
Seest thou not oft, from different winds, the clouds
Above borne different from the clouds below ?
Why then, alike, may different streams of air Bend not the stars, the planets through their paths ?
Then night, at length, the world with darkness shrouds, Or since the sun, at heaven's remotest verge, Tired with his toil, his remnant lamp blows out, Curtailed already by the race achieved Through long concussive air;
or the same power Still drives his restless axle earth beneath, That, through the day, propelled his orb sublime.
Then the young MORNING, too, at hour precise Leads through th' ethereal realms the rosy dawn, New light diffusing;
either since the sun, Th' inferior earth encompassed, now once more Tries his fresh strength, and with projected rays Anticipates his orb;
or that the seeds
Of embryo-fires.
in full divan convened
At punctual periods in the purple east, Gradual condense, and rear the solar blaze.
For thus, we learn, from IDA'S top surveyed, Seem they, the flames diffused conglobing firm Till springs, at length,the radiant orb complete.
Nor strange conceive it that the seeds of fire
Should thus assemble, and, at hour precise, Renew the solar splendour:
facts like these All nature wide displays;
at hour precise Blossoms the shrub, at hour precise its bloom Loses deciduous;
fixt, determined time Throws from the boy his infant teeth, arrays
In downy puberty, and, o'er his cheeks, Flings the first feathers of th' unripened beard.
Clouds, thunders, tempests, rains, and gelid snows, At punctual seasons all alike recur.
For as the train of causes first uprose, And the young world its earliest features found, Things follow things in order most exact.
And day elongates, and the night contracts, And night augments, and day curtails its course, Since the same sun, earth under and above Revolving, ether with unequal curve Cleaves, and to parts of magnitude unlike Severs the globe;
alternate this o'er that Prevailing gradual till the nodes he reach
Where night and day assimilate their reigns.
For, in the central realms 'twixt north and south, His utmost wanderings, midway, heaven divides:
So traverse winds the star-enamelled path Through which his mazy steps the seasons lead, With ray oblique illuming earth and sky.
For thus they hold the heavenly orb who mark Throughout arranged with constellations fair.
Or, earth beneath, the atmosphere, perchance, Hangs,in fixt places, heavier;
whence the seeds
Of congregating fires, with toil immense, Wade through, and later weave the trembling dawn:
And whence, through winter, long the tedious night Drawls, ere the day-star rears his radiant front.
Or, haply, the young fires that frame the sun More swift or tardy towards the purple east Alternate rush, as round the seasons roll.
The moon may shine by solar lustres struck, Her argent front augmenting every day As from the sun she wanders, till, at length.'
Now full opposed, her total disc is light, And, rising east, she marks his westward fall:
Then step by step retracting, earth beneath, Her full-blown lamp, as towards the sun she curves, Through all the remnant of the radiant signs;
As deems the sage who holds her form globose, And that below the solar orb her path Punctual she winds ;
and sound the doctrine seems.
Yet may the moon with lustre all her own Shine, every phase unfolding, if,in front, Some other orb attend her, through her course Gliding complete, in every mode convolved, While viewless still to sight since reared opaque.
Or she may still, if spherical of form, Each change disclose, though luminous but half:
For, as she self-revolves,her gradual lamp Must grow till all her bright side beams complete;
Then, rolling still, as gradual must she close
Her lucid eye, till all opposed is shade;
As teach CHALDEAN magi, striving strong
The schools of GREECE t’o'erpower, as though the creeds Waged endless war, or this than that adduced Proofs more conclusive to th' unbiassed mind.
Why too may not each rising moon be new ?
Its time, form, place, by nicest order swayed, And, springing daily, daily too decay, Still reproduced for ever ?
this to solve Both words and reasoning arduous find alike, Since things throughout in order flow precise.
SPRING comes, and VENUS, and, with foot advanced, The light-winged ZEPHYR, harbinger beloved, Maternal FLORA strewing, ere she treads, O'er every footstep blooms of choicest hue, And the glad ETHER loading with perfumes.
Then HEAT succeeds, the parched ETESIAN breeze, And dust-discoloured CERES ;
AUTUMN, then, Follows, and tipsy BACCHUS arm in arm, And STORMS and TEMPESTS;
EURUS roars amain;
And the red SOUTH brews thunders:
till, at length, COLD shuts the scene, and WINTER'S train prevails, SNOWS, hoary SLEET, and FROST with chattering teeth.
Whence scarce stupendous seems it that the moon Should punctual rise, and, rising, punctual die, Since things at large, so punctual, things succeed.
Thus, too, to various causes may'st thou charge
The sun's eclipse, or shade of lunar light.
For why should rather, 'twixt the sun and earth, The moon rush rampant, and with shadowy orb, Shut from mankind the radiant fount of day, Than aught besides that haply may subsist Rolling sublime, but ever void of light ?
Why may not, too, in time and place prescribed, The sun himself grow languid, his bright beam Powerless to pour, till now the spot he pass
That thus obstructs his glory and renews ?
And why, moreover, should earth alone arrest Light from the labouring moon, and, riding high, Blindfold the solar disc, the lunar sphere, Still loftier, gliding through her shadowy cone, While nought of body else, 'twixt moon and sun Rushing, can quench the ray profusely dealt ?
So, if the moon herself be lustrous, why May ne'er that lustre languish till the bound Joyous she pass that poisons all her lamp ?
Thus having traced the causes obvious most
That sway the sapphire heavens;
whence the bright sun, The moon fulfil their courses, and the shade
How reared that oft their radiant front enwraps, Hiding abrupt, as though their eyes now winked, And now re-opened, o'er the face of things Shedding afresh clear floods of lucid white;
Once more return we to the world's pure prime, Her fields yet liquid, and the tribes survey First she put forth, and trusted to the winds.
And first the race she reared of verdant herbs, Glistening o'er every hill;
the fields at large Shone with the verdant tincture, and the trees
Felt the deep impulse, and with outstretched arms Broke from their bonds rejoicing.
As the down Shoots from the winged nations, or from beasts Bristles or hair, so poured the new-born earth Plants, fruits, and herbage.
Then, in order next, Raised she the sentient tribes, in various modes, By various powers distinguished:
for nor heaven Down dropped them, nor from ocean's briny waves Sprang they, terrestrial sole;
whence, justly, EARTH Claims the dear name of mother, since alone Flowed from herself whatever the sight surveys.
E'en now oft rears she many a sentient tribe, By showers and sun-shine ushered into day.
Whence less stupendous tribes should then have risen More, and of ampler make, herself new-formed, In fiower of youth, and ETHER all mature.
Of these birds first, of wing and plume diverse, Broke their light shells in spring-time:
as in spring Still breaks the grasshopper his curious web, And seeks, spontaneous, foods and vital air.
Then rushed the ranks of mortals;
for the soil, Exuberant then, with warmth and moisture teemed.
So, o'er each scene appropriate, myriad wombs Shot, and expanded, to the genial sward By fibres fixt;
and as, in ripened hour, Their liquid orbs the daring fetus broke
Of breath impatient, nature here transformed Th' assenting earth, and taught her opening veins
With juice to flow lacteal;
as the fair Now with sweet milk o'erflows, whose raptured breast First hails the stranger-babe, since all absorbed Of nurture, to the genial tide converts.
Earth fed the nursling, the warm ether clothed, And the soft downy grass his couch composed.
For the fresh world, as yet, no chills severe, No parching heats, nor boisterous whirlwinds knew;
These, like all else, by time alone matured.
Hence the dear name of mother, o'er and o'er, Earth claims most justly, since the race of man Long bore she of herself, each brutal tribe Wild-wandering o'er the mountains, and the birds Gay-winged, that cleave, diverse, the liquid air.
Yet drew, at length, the moment when herself Could bear no longer;
like her daughters since, By age divested of parturient power.
For age the total world transforms, from state To state for ever passing ;
nought remains
Long its own like;
all migrates sight surveys, Varying each hour, from change to change propelled.
This grows and ripens, and with age corrupts;
That, from its ruins, springs, and perfects life.
So time transmutes the total world's vast frame, From state to state urged on, now void of powers Erst known, and boasting those unknown before.
Hence, doubtless, earth prodigious forms at first Gendered, of face and members most grotesque ;
Monsters half-no an, half-woman, not from each Distant, yet neither total;
shapes unsound, Footless, and handless, void of mouth or eye, Or from misj unction, maimed, of limb with limb:
To act all impotent, or flee from harm, Or nurture take their loathsome days t' extend.
These sprang at first, and things alike uncouth;
Yet vainly;
for abhorrent NATURE quick Checked their vile growth;
so life's consummate flower Ne'er reached they, foods appropriate never cropped, Nor tasted joys venereal.
For with cause Cause ceaseless must combine, or nought can rise
Of race generic;
genial foods must spring
And genial organs, from the total frame
The vital seeds concocted to collect;
And male must blend with female, and the bliss Educed prove mutual, ere effect can flow.
Hence, doubtless, many a tribe has sunk supprest, Powerless its kind to gender.
For whatever Feeds on the living ether, craft or speed, Or courage stern, from age to age preserves
In ranks uninjured:
while full many a class Man guards himself, incited by their use.
In strength ferocious thus the lion trusts, In guile the fox, the stag in peerless flight;
While the light-slumbering dog, of heart sincere, The bounding courser, herds, and fleecy flocks, These, MEMMIUS, these protection claim from man.
For these the baser broods fly anxious, fond Of quiet soft, and meals themselves ne'er bought;
Boons we bestow from certainty of gain.
But those such powers that boast not, void of means Formed, for defence, nor tribute to mankind Repaying ever-why should human aid to such be lent, redeeming them from death ?
These, from their native bondage, must perforce Fall to the feller sports, and victims rude, Till the whole order cease, from earth extinct.
Yet CENTAURS lived not:
nor could shapes like these Live ever, from two different natures reared, Discordant limbs, and powers by powers reversed.
E'en this the dullest thus with ease may learn.
The steed, o'er whom the year has thrice revolved, Grows firm and vigorous;
but the babe a babe Still proves, and haply still explores, asleep, The dulcet breast whose stores were late his own.
When, too, the steed's strong fibres faint with age, And every member feels the coming fate, Youth o'er the boy his fairest flower expands, And the soft down sprouts earliest from his chin.
Deem not that man, then, and the servile horse, Seeds mixt with seeds, can CENTAURS e'er create ;
Or, false alike, that SCYLLAS e'er exist, Half-maid, half-mastiff;
or aught else of shape Engendered equal, dissonant of limb, Whose flowery strength at different age matures, And fades as different;
whose connubial fires Burn not the same;
whose total tempers jar, And from discordant foods who nurture life :
For hemlock, oft, rank poison to mankind, Fattens the bearded goat with foul repast.too, since flame the lion's tawny skin
As fiercely burns as aught of brute besides, Whence, when three natures into one combine, The front a lion forming, the vile rump A dragon, and the midst a goat grotesque, Hence termed CHIMERA, can the breathing lungs Pour streams of fire innocuous from the mouth ?
Hence those who hold, when heaven and earth were new.
Urged by that newness as their total proof, Such monsters rose, and shapes alike absurd, On equal ground might feign the world's first floods
Were liquid gold, her earliest blossoms pearls, And the first men such massy limbs displayed That seas might rush beneath each ample stride, And their vast fingers twirl the heaven's high orb.
But though, commixt, then various seeds of things Thronged through the teeming soil, it flows not hence
That tribes unlike sprang forth with blended limbs.
Still from the soil herbs, fruits, and trees diverse
Shoot in profusion ;
but each separate class Ne'er blends preposterous.
Things throughout proceed
In firm, undevious order, and maintain.
To nature true, their fixt generic stamp.
Yet man's first sons, as o'er the fields they trod, Reared from the hardy earth, were hardier far;
Strong built with ampler bones, with muscles nerved Broad and substantial;
to the power of heat, Of cold, of varying viands, and disease, Each hour superior;
the wild lives of beasts Leading, while many a lustre o'er them rolled.
Nor crooked plough-share knew they, nor to drive, Deep through the soil, the rich-returning spade;
Norhow the tender seedling to re-plant, Nor from the fruit-tree prune the withered branch.
What showers bestowed, what earth spontaneous bore, And suns matured, their craving breasts appeased.
But acorn-meals chief culled they from the shade
Of forest-oaks;
and, in their wintry months, The wild wood-whortle with its purple fruit Fed them, then larger and more amply poured.
And many a boon besides, now long extinct, The fresh-formed earth her hapless offspring dealt.
Then floods, and fountains, too, their thirst to slake, Called them, as now the cataract abrupt Calls, when athirst, the desert's savage tribes.
And, through the night still wandering, they the caves Thronged of the wood-nymphs, whence the babbling well Gushed oft profuse, and down its pebbly sides, Its pebbly sides with verdant moss o’erspread, Oozed slow, or sought, redundant sought, the plains.
Nor knew they yet the crackling blaze t' excite, Or clothe their limbs with furs, or savage hides.
But groves concealed them, woods, and hollow hills;
And, when rude rains, or bitter blasts o'erpowered, Low bushy shrubs their squalid members wrapped.
Nor public weal they boasted, nor the bonds Sacred of laws, and order;
what loose chance Offered, each seized instinctive;
for himself, His life, his limbs, instructed sole to care.
Wild in the forests they fulfilled their loves, Or urged by mutual raptures, or the male, Stung by fierce lust the female form subdued, Or bought her favours by the tempting bait Of acorns, crabs, or berries blushing deep.
And in their keen rapidity of hand
And foot confiding, oft the savage train With missile stones they hunted, or the force
Of clubs enormous ;
many a tribe they felled, Yet some in caves shunned, cautious;
where, at night, Thronged they, like bristly swine;
their naked limbs With herbs and leaves entwining.
Nought of fear Urged them to quit the darkness, and recall, With clamorous cries, the sunshine and the day:
But sound they sunk in deep, oblivious sleep, Till o'er the mountains blushed the roseate dawn.
For, from their birth, with ceaseless sight they traced Night and the noon alternate, nor e'en once Sprang the dread thought that such alternate night Would ere long reign eternal, and the noon O'er their closed eye-balls never glitter more.
This ne'er distressed them, but the fear alone Some ruthless monster might their dreams molest, The foamy boar, or lion, from their caves Drive them aghast beneath the midnight shade, And seize their leaf-wrought couches for themselves.
Yet then scarce more of mortal race than now Left the sweet lustre of the liquid day.
Some, doubtless, oft the prowling monsters gaunt Grasped in their jaws, abrupt;
whence, through the groves, The woods, the mountains, they vociferous groaned, Destined thus living to a living tomb.
And some, by flight though saved from present fate, Covering their fetid ulcers with their hands, Prone o'er the ground death-still, with horrid voice, Called, till vile worms devoured them, void of aid, And all unskilled their deadly pangs t' appease.
But thousands, then, the pomps of war beneath, Fell not at once;
nor ocean's boisterous waves Wrecked, o'er rough rocks, whole fleets and countless crews Nor ocean then, though oft to frenzy wrought, Could aught indulge but ineffectual ire:
Nor, lulled to calms, could e'er his traitor face Lead, o'er the laughing waves, mistrustful man, Untaught the dangerous science of the seas.
Then want consumed their languid members, now Full-gorged excess devours us:
they themselves Fed, heedless, oft with poisons:
otter still Men now for others mix the fatal cup.
Yet when, at length, rude huts they first devised, And fires, and garments;
and, in union sweet, Man wedded woman, the pure joys indulged Of chaste connubial love, and children rose, The rough barbarians softened.
The warm hearth
Their frames so melted they no more could bear, As erst, th' uncovered skies;
the nuptial bed Broke their wild vigour, and the fond caress
Of prattling children from the bosom chased
Their stern ferocious manners.
Neighbours now Joined in the bonds of friendship,and resolved
The softer sex to cherish, and their babes;
And owned by gestures, signs, and sounds uncouth, 'Twas just the weaklier to protect from harm.
Yet all such bonds obeyed not;
but the good, The larger part their faith still uncorrupt Kept, or the race of man had long expired, Nor sire to son transferred the life received.
Then nature, next, the tongue's innumerous tones Urged them to try ;
and sage convenience soon
To things applied them:
as the embryo speech
Of infants first the aid of gesture claims, And pointing finger to define its sense.
For all their proper powers perceive, and feel
The use intended.
The young calf, whose horns
Ne'er yet have sprouted, with his naked front Butts when enraged:
the lion-whelp or pard With claws and teeth contends, ere teeth or claws Scarce spring conspicuous:
while the pinioned tribes Trust to their wings, and, from th' expanded down Draw, when first fledged, a tremulous defence.
But to maintain that one devised alone Terms for all nature, and th' incipient tongue Taught to the gazers round him, is to rave.
For how should he this latent power possess
Of naming all things, and inventing speech, If never mortal felt the same besides ?
And, if none else had e'er adopted sounds, Whence sprang the knowledge of their use ?
or how Could this first linguist to the crowds around Teach what he meaned ?
his sole unaided arm Could ne'er overpower them, and compel to learn
The vocal science, nor could aught avail
Of eloquence or wisdom :
nor with ease
Would the vain babbler have been long allowed To pour his noisy jargon o'er their ears.
But why so wondrous seems it that mankind, With voice and tongue endowed, to notice things
That voice should vary with the things themserves,
When the mute herds, and beasts ferocious, urged By grief, or fear, or soft, emollient joy, Press from their lungs sounds various and unlike ?
This every hour displays.
When half-enraged
The rude MOLOSSIAN mastiff, her keen teeth Baring tremendous, with far different tone Threats, than when roused to madness more extreme, Or when she barks, and fills the world with roar.
Thus when her fearless whelps, too, she with tongue Lambent caresses, and with antic paw, And tooth restrained, pretending still to bite, Gambols, soft yelping tones of tender love-
Far differ then those accents from the din Urged clamorous through the mansion when alone, Or the shrill howl her trembling bosom heaves
When, with slunk form, she waits th' impending blow.
Neighs not the steed, too, different, when at large, Mid the young mares, in life's luxuriant prime, Pierced by the goads of pinioned love, he raves,- And when his full-blown nostrils snort for war, And every quivering limb the tumult hails ?
So, too, the feathery tribes of wing diverse, Osprey, or hawk, or cliff-delighted gull Gathering its vital nurture from the deep, Far different sounds at different times protrude
Than when they strive, in hostile guise, for prey.
E'en with the seasons some, as fame reports, Change their hoarse accents, as the social rook, And time-triumphant raven, when for showers, Or limpid rills they croak ;
or, sultry, pant, Beneath the dog-star, for the freshening breeze.
Since then such various feelings can compel Kinds the most mute such various sounds to eject, How just ensues it that the race of man Should things diverse by countless tones denote ?
If through such subjects thou would'st farther pry, Know, then, that fire from thunder earliest sprang, Each flame hence gendered.
For full many a scene Worked into blaze, th* ethereal flash beneath, ills See we the moment the dread shock is dealt.
Oft see we, too, when, waving in the winds, Trees war with trees, the repercussion fierce 'Twixt branch and branch, stupendous, heat evolve, Heat oft by flame succeeded;
whence, perchance, From both mankind their primal fires deduced.
But from the sun first learned they to prepare
The cultured meal hot-hissing o'er the hearth.
For all the plains produced the genial sun
They saw subjecting, by perpetual warmth Matured, and sweetened:
whence the wiser part First dared the change, and taught their wondering peers
The powers of coction, and the crackling blaze.
Those, too, elected rulers, now began Towns to project, and raise the massy fort, Heedful of distant dangers.
Into shares
Their herds and lands they severed;
and on those Chief famed for beauty, eloquence, or strength, Allotted ampler portions:
for the form Much then availed, and much the potent arm.
But wealth ere long was fashioned, gold uprose, And half the power of strength,and beauty fled.
And still the brave, the beauteous still, too oft, Alike to riches bow the servile knee.
Yet truest riches, would mankind their breasts Bend to the precept, in a little lie, With mind well-poised;
here want can never come.
But men will grasp at fame, will pant for power, As here though fortune fixed her firmest foot, And, these once gained, all else were peace and joy.
Fools thus to reason !
for the total path '
Whoe'er attempts finds thronged with toils and pain;
And ENVY oft, like lightning, many a wretch E'en on its summit fixt, and free from fear, Abrupt hurls headlong into gulfs profound.
Whence safer seems it far in low estate Peaceful to serve, than reign, and rule mankind.
But, vainly wearied, let them their life-blood Sweat out, thus labouring up the tortuous steep, O'er which, like lightning,ENVY brews her storms, Fond of high stations-since to tales they trust Told them by others, while each sense possest Belies the daring fiction;
men not more
Thus act, nor will do, than they erst have done.
But kings, and tyrants fell, their thrones reversed, Their sceptres shivered, and the sparkling crown
That decked their temples, to the dust condemned, Weeping its fate beneath the people's tread, Soon roused to trample what too much they fear.
So to the rabble sunk, and ranks most vile, The power supreme ;
in one gross scramble all Striving for office, and superior sway.
Yet order hence re-issued:
some, at length, New magistracies planned, new laws devised, And all concurred t' obey them :
for the strife 'Twixt man and man exhausted all their strength ;
Hence easier led, spontaneous, to the yoke Of equal rule and justice.
Passion oft Roused them, they saw, to vengeance too severe, Broils heaped o'er broils the most ferocious tired, And ceaseless fear marred all the bliss of life.
For force and rapine in their craftiest nets
Oft their own sons entangle, and the plague Ten-fold recoils;
nor can the wretch with ease Live blest and tranquil whose atrocious soul Bursts the dear bonds of peace and social love.
For, though from men, from gods, his guilt he hide, Detection fears he still;
since oft in dreams, In deep deliriums oft, th' unshackled tongue Tells crimes aloud for ever else concealed.
Next learn what cause, through many a mighty realm,
The system first of gods, and altars reared;
Whence the dread rites with solemn pomp pursued
When aught momentous man presumes t' attempt;
The sacred horror, whence, that, through the world, Builds temples, statues, feasts and fasts ordains.
This to resolve the muse not arduous deems.
For the first mortals effigies of gods
Oft traced awake, when mused the mind profound, Yet, mid their dreams, still otter, and in shape More vast and wondrous;
these of sense possest Quick they conceived, since moved they every limb, And spoke majestic with enormous voice Worthy their matchless make.
Immortal life Next they bestowed, since with unvarying face, Unvarying form, the phantoms ever rose (As rise they must);
and o'er such massy strength No power, they deemed, could triumph.
Blest supreme
Then, too, they held them, since the dread of death Such ne'er could haunt, and deeds stupendous oft Seemed they, in dreams, with utmost ease t' achieve.
Each various phase, moreover, the heavens disclose, Each various season, punctual to its hour
They marked incessant;
and, the cause unknown, These to the gods, with subterfuge most prompt, Nodding omnific, idly they referred.
And in the heavens their blest abodes they placed, Their awful temples, since both sun and moon Here radiant reign;
sun, moon, and day, and night, And night's dread fires, and meteors wandering wild, And swift-plumed lightnings,showers, and crystal dews, Clouds, snows, winds, thunders, hail, and countless storms, Through ether threatening with tremendous roar.0 hapless mortals !
that could first ascribe Such facts, such furies to th' immortal gods.
What myriad groans then reared ye for yourselves!
What wounds for us!
what tears for men unborn!
No :
-it can ne'er be piety to turn
To stocks and stones with deep-veiled visage;
light O'er every altar incense ;
o'er the dust Fall prostrate, and, with outstretched arms, invoke Through every temple every god that reigns, Soothe them with blood, and lavish vows on vows.
This rather thou term piety, to mark With calm, untrembling soul each scene ordained.
For when we, doubtful, heaven's high arch survey, The firm, fixt ether, star-embossed, and pause O'er the sun's path, and pale, meandering moon, Then superstitious cares, erewhile represt By cares more potent, lift their hydra-head. " What!
from the gods, then, flows this power immense
That sways, thus various, the bright host of stars ?
(For dubious reason still the mind perturbs :
) "
This wondrous world how formed they ?
to what end Doomed ?
through what period can its labouring walls
Bear the vast toil, the motions now sustained?
Or have th' immortals framed it free from death, In firm, undevious course empowered to glide O’er the broad ravage of eternal time ?
"Then, too, what breast recoils not with the dread Of gods like these ?
who, with unshuddering limbs, Can view them dart o'er earth their forky flash, And roll their deep-toned thunder ?
shrink not then Whole lands, whole nations ?
o'er his shivering throne Starts not the tyrant, through each tendon starts, Mad with the sense of perfidies and blood, And in the storm contemplating his due ?
—Then faints not, too, the warlike chief who guides
His fleet o'er ocean, when around him roars
The maniac whirlwind ?
falls he not profound Mid his vast elephants, and victor hosts, And tempts the gods with vows, and prays, aghast, For winds appeased, and soft succeeding gales ?
Yet vainly:
for the wild tornado oft Hurls him all headlong to the gates of hell.
So, from his awful shades some POWER UNSEEN O'ei throws all human greatness!
treads to dust Rods, ensigns, crowns-the proudest pomps of state, And laughs at all the mockery of man !
When, too, the total earth beneath us quakes, And tottering towns loud tumble, or so threat, What wonder men their littleness should feel, And to thegods all power and might ascribe, Whence rule they, ceaseless, this stupendous world ?
This clear discussed, learn next that silver, gold, Lead, hardier copper, iron, first were traced
When, o'er the hills, some conflagration dire Burned from its basis the deep-rooted grove ;
By lightnings haply kindled, or the craft
Of hosts contending o'er the woodland scenes, A double fear thus striking through their foes:
Or by the shepherd's wish his bounds t' enlarge O'er tracts of specious promise;
or, perchance, Wild beasts to slaughter, and their spoils possess ;
For such, with fire, and guileful pit, mankind First caught, ere hounds were marshalled to the chace, Or round the copse the mazy net-work drawn.
-Whatever the cause, when now the unctuous flame
Had from their utmost roots, with hideous crash, Felled the tall trees, and, with its torrid heat, The soil deep-reddened, rills of liquid gold, Lead, silver, copper, through its fervid pores Glided amain, and every hollow filled.
These when, condensed, long after men surveyed Glistening in earth, attracted by the glare, The splendid mass they dug ;
and marked, surprised, Each formed alike, and, to the channeled bed Where late it lay, adapted most precise.
Then instant deemed they, liquefied by flame, The power were theirs each various shape t' assume, Drawn dexterous out, of point or edge acute;
The power unrivalled theirs each tool to frame
Art needs to fell the forest, and its trees Mould into planks or beams;
to cleave, or smooth, Pierce, hollow, scoop, whatever the plan conceived.
Nor strove they less such instruments t' obtain From gold, or silver, than stern copper's strength.
Yet vainly :
for their softer texture failed, Powerless to bear the sturdy toil required.
Whence copper chief they courted, while all gold Neglected lay, too blunt and dull for use.
Now triumphs gold, while copper sinks despised.
So rolling years the seasons change of things :
What once was valued loses all its worth, And what was worthlessrises in its stead, Swells into notice daily, every hour Blooms with new praise, and captive leads the world.
And hence how first the vigorous iron charmed, Thyself, 0 MEmmius, may'st with ease deduce.
Man's earliest arms were fingers, teeth, and nails, And stones, and fragments from the branching woods.
Then fires and flames they joined, detected soon;
Then copper next;
and last, as latest traced, The tyrant iron, than the copper vein Less freely found, and sturdier to subdue.
Hence first with copper ploughed they;
in the waves Mixed of wild warfare, dealt its deadly wounds, And ransacked fields, and cattle;
for th' unarmed Soon yielded all things to the armed foe.
But, by degrees, the blade of iron gleamed, Triumphant rising o'er the copper tool.
With iron sole the genial soil they clove, And with its fury tried the doubtful fray.
First, too, on horse-back strove the martial chief, The reins his left hand guiding, and his right Ruling the battle:
then appeared he next Drawn by twin steeds in warlike car sublime, Both hands in action, by the driver sped.
Then twins to twins he joined, and to the car Fixed the curved scythe.
And next the TYRIAN tribes Taught the huge elephant, with fortress loins
And lithe proboscis, to delight in wounds, And break the hostile squadrons.
Step by step
So DISCORD poured her plagues accurst o'er man, And heightened daily all the woes of war.
Some too, as story tells, wild bulls and boars Trained to the strife, and taught to face the foe.
While the rude PARTHIANS marshalled, mid their ranks, Troops of fierce lions, by their keepers led, To chain or loose them as the combat called.
Yet vain th' attempt;
for, maddened by the blood Promiscuous spilt, o'er friends and foes alike Rushed they voracious, shaking their dread crests;
Nor could the horseman his affrighted steed Calm, or goad on the battle to renew.
Wide sprang the forest-tyrants, all in front Instant overpowering ;
and, full oft, behind Tumbling abrupt, the backward crowds, aghast, Fixed they to earth, vain-grappling,—by their paws And teeth terrific torn alike to death.
Then, too, the boars, high tossed tli' infuriate bulls, Or crushed them with their hoofs ;
or through the steeds
Drove deep their gory horns, appalled and faint, Or 'gainst the ground their frantic foreheads dashed.
While the mad boars against their owners aimed
Their tusks remorseless, tinging with their blood Th' unbroken darts, (the broken they themselves Tinged with their own blood, trailing o'er the ground,) In one joint tumult slaughtering man and horse.
And though the steed strove oft by sudden start, Sidelong, to fly the fang, or pranced erect Beating th' unsolid air, 'twas idle all, Since, rent through many a tendon, down he sunk, Shaking the champaign.
Thus the beasts they deemed
At home tamed amply, mid the battle's rage, Its wounds, its shrieks, its terrors, and its toils, Frantic once more surveyed they, void of rule.
All, rampant, raved alike, as frequent now Raves the young elephant to arms unused, Trampling his keepers with tremendous crush.
Thus men, perchance, have fought;
or, rather, thus
Their fights have planned in secret, pausing deep
O'er the dread ills such schemes were sure t' unfold.
Whence, if such wars have raged, 'tis safer far, Amid the various worlds through space that throng, To leave their seat uncertain, than towards earth Specific point, or aught of world besides.
Yet must they, doubtless, have been waged from hope Far less of conquest than revenge, each host Unarmed, unmarshalled, and of death assured.
The rude-stitched hide preceded the wove vest, Planned after iron, and with iron wrought:
For without this the loom had ne'er been framed, Its shuttles, treadles, sley, and creaking beam.
Yet men first used the distaff, and the wheel, Ere learned the female race ;
since males throughout Prove prompter far, more dexterous, and expert;
Till the rough swain, at length,such labours mocked
As sole the woman’s province, sterner toils
The man's rude strength demanding, hardier arts His form to harden, nerved with double force.
But Nature's self th' untutored race first taught
To sow, to graft;
for acorns ripe they saw, And purple berries, shattered from the trees, Soon yield a lineage like the trees themselves.
Whence learned they, curious, through the stem mature
To thrust the tender slip, and o'er the soil Plant the fresh shoots that first disordered sprang.
Then, too, new cultures tried they, and, with joy, Marked the boon earth, by ceaseless care caressed, Each barbarous fruitage sweeten and subdue.
So loftier still and loftier up the hills
Drove they the woodlands daily, broadening thus
The cultured foreground, that the sight might trace Meads, corn-fields, rivers, lakes, and vineyards gay, O'er hills and mountains thrown;
while through the dales, The downs, the slopes, ran lavish and distinct
The purple realm of olives;
as with hues Distinct, though various still the landscape swells
Where blooms the dulcet apple, mid the tufts
Of trees diverse that blend their joyous shades.
And from the liquid warblings of the birds Learned they their first rude notes, ere music yet To the rapt ear had tuned the measured verse;
And ZEPHYR, whispering through the hollow reeds, Taught the first swains the hollow reeds to sound:
Whence woke they soon those tender-trembling tonea
Which the sweet pipe, when by the fingers prest, Pours o'er the hills, the vales, and woodlands wild, Haunts of lone shepherds, and the rural gods.
So growing time points, ceaseless, something new.
And human skill evolves it into day.
Thus soothed they every care, with music, thus, Closed every meal, for rests the bosom then.
And oft they threw them on the velvet grass, Near gliding streams, by shadowy trees o’er-arched, And void of costly wealth found still the means To gladden life.
But chief when genial Spring Led forth her laughing train, and the young year Painted the meads with roseate flowers profuse-
Then mirth, and wit, and wiles, and frolic, chief, Flowed from the heart;
,for then the rustic muse Warmest inspired them :
then lascivious sport Taught round their heads, their shoulders, taught to twine Foliage, and flowers, and garlands richly dight;
To loose, innumerous time their limbs to move, And beat, with sturdy foot, maternal earth;
While many a smile, and many a laughter loud, Told all was new, and wondrous much esteemed.
Thus wakeful lived they, cheating of its rest
The drowsy midnight;
with the jocund dance Mixing gay converse, madrigals, and strains Run o'er the reeds with broad recumbent lip:
As, wakeful still, our revellers through night Lead on their defter dance to time precise;
Yet cull not costlier sweets, with all their art, Than the rude offspring earth in woodlands bore.
Thus what first strikes us, while ourselves as yet Know nought superior, every charm combines, But when aught else of ampler boast succeeds
We slight the former, every wish transferred.
Thus acorns soon disgusted ;
the coarse couch
Of herbs and leaves was banished, and the hides
Of savage beasts deemed barbarous, and uncouth.
Yet the vast envy such these first inspired
Their earliest wearer by the faithless crowd Fell, and the garb, ferocious fought for still, Rent into tatters, perished void of use.
Then man for skins contended:
purple now And gold for ever plunge him into war;
Far slenderer pretext!
for, such skins without,
Thenaked throngs had dreaded every blast:
But us no ills can menace, though deprived
Of purple woof brocaded stiff with gold, While humbler vests still proffer their defence.
Yet vainly, vainly toil earth's restless tribes, With fruitless cares corroding every hour;
Untaught the lust of wishing where to bound, And where true pleasure ceases;
rendering time One joyless main, where sail they, void of helm, Courting for ever tumults, storms, and strife.
But, through the heavens, the wakeful sun and moon Driving, meanwhile, their radiant cars sublime, Taught first to mortals how the seasons rolled, And things rose punctual ruled by punctual laws.
Now many a fort they reared, and into shares
Severed the cultured earth ;
the daring bark
O'er ocean now its light-winged canvass spread, And state with state in social compact joined:
While rising bards, the types of sound just traced, Stamped each exploit, and told to times unborn.
Whence nought of earlier date, as facts precise, Know we, alone by reason led to guess.
Thus navigation, agriculture, arms, Laws, buildings, high-ways, drapery, all esteemed Useful to life, or to the bosom dear, Song, painting, sculpture-their perpetual need, And long experience fashioned and refined.
growing time points ceaseless something new, And human skill evolves it into day:
And art, harmonious, ever aiding art, All reach, at length, perfection's topmost point.
ATHENS, of peerless name, to savage man First taught the blessings of the cultured field, His life re-modelled, and with laws secured.
She, too, the soul's sweet solaces first oped
When erst the sage she reared, whose boundless breast Swelled with all science, and whose lips promulged ;
Raised, such th' applause his heavenly dictates drew, Raised after death, in glory to the skies.
For when he saw with what vast ease mankind Food, health, enjoyment, length of days obtained, How wealth full oft o’verflowed them with its tide, How honours thronged on honours, and a race With every virtue gifted, round them rose, While still their hearts beat anxious, and their minds Raged with complaints, vexations, and alarms,- Then deemed the sage the mental vase itself Unsound throughout;
despoiling, hence, the power Of all that entered, useful or beloved;
Fractured, perchance, or porous, and each boon Wasting profuse the moment it arrived;
Or, from innate corruption, all received Poisoning perpetual through its total frame.
With truth-instilling precepts, hence, the soul Purged he, the bounds of wishing and of fear Pointed precise, and showed to mortal man
The good supreme his heart would fain possess.
He oped its essence, he the path disclosed, Narrow, but straight, that leads us where it dwells.
He, too, evinced what ills on life must wait;
What casual spring, from nature what uprise, At random roaming, or by fate compelled, And how such ills the soul may best resist;
Nor sink, as frequent sinks the world, ingulfed In boundless tides of turbulence and care.
For as the boy, when midnight veils the skies, Trembles and starts at all things, so full oft E'en in the noon men start at things as void
Of real danger as the phantoms false
By darkness conjured and the school-boy's dread.
A terror this the radiant darts of day Can ne'er disperse, to TRUTHS pure light alone And WISDOM yielding, intellectual suns.
Whence, with more haste, our subject we resume.
Since this vast globe, then, mortal we have proved Begot, and mortal ether, and that all Reared punctual from their atoms must dissolve, Mark what remains, attentive;
since once more
The master of the gale invites to mount
The daring bark majestic, and each storm Soothes with his fostering favour as we sail.
This mark attentive:
for whatever in heaven,
In earth man sees mysterious, shakes his mind, With sacred awe overwhelms him, and his soul Bows to the dust;
the cause of things concealed Once from his vision, instant to the gods
All empire he transfers, all rule supreme, And doubtful whence they spring, with headlong haste Calls them the workmanship of powers divine.
For he who, justly, deems th* immortals live Safe, and at ease, yet fluctuates in his mind How things are swayed;
how, chiefly, those discerned In heaven sublime,-to superstition back Lapses, and rears a tyrant host, and then Conceives, dull reasoner, they can all things do, While yet himself nor knows what may be done, Nor what may never, nature powers defined Stamping on all, and bounds that none can pass:
Hence wide, and wider errs he as he walks.
These notions if thou chase not, driving far Thoughts of the gods unworthy, and adverse
To the pure peace they covet, thou wilt oft Foretaste the heavenly vengeance that thou dread'st.
Not that the majesty of powers like these Rage e'er can violate, or dire revenge Rouse into action ;
but that thou thyself
Hence thy own ease wilt shipwreck with the storms
Of passions fierce and foul;
nor e'er approach With hallowed heart the temples they possess, Nor, deeply musing, mark with soul serene
The sacred semblances their forms emit, Traced by the spirit, thus of gods assured.
Judge, then, thyself what life must hence ensue.
Such life the wisdom we propound rejects:
Whence, though already much the muse has sung, Much still remains that claims her noblest powers ;
Much of the heavens, and scenes that roll sublime, Of storms, and thunders—what their dread effect, And how produced:
lest, mid the rending skies, Fear-struck, thou ask whence flows this winged fire?
Where speeds its fury ?
by what means empowered
To pierce through walls, and then triumphant die?
And, doubtful whence it springs, with headlong haste Deem it the workmanship of hands divine.
Muse, most expert!
beloved of gods and men, CALLIOPE !0, aid me as I tread Now the last limits of the path prescribed, That the bright crown with plaudits I may claim.
First the blue cope of heaven with thunder shakes
When, borne through ether, clouds with clouds contend
By winds adversely driven ;
for nought of sound Strikes us where pure the concave;
but where thick Clouds heaped o'er clouds, there, measured by their mass, The deep-toned peal with broadening bellow rears.
Then less compact their texture than the frame
Of wood or stone, while less diffused by far Than the loose web of mists,or light-winged smoke.
For else, like those, plumb downward must they rush With flight abrupt, or swift as these dissolve, Powerless to buoy the measured hail or snow.
Then, too, resound they through the sapphire vault, As oft resound the flickering curtains drawn O'er the thronged theatre from beam to beam.
And oft to fragments frittered by the blast, Like crackling scrolls they rattle through the skies:
Whence peals the thunder, as the fluttering sheet Of parchment crisp, or canvass broad unfurled, Lashed by the tempest, and to tatters torn.
And frequent the fierce clouds with front direct
Fight not, but jostle side-long, with the strife
Their total tracts abrading;
whence the harsh, The long-drawn murmur that the soul appals Ere yet the full-mouthed clangour burst its bounds.
Then things with thunder oft, perchance, may quake, And heaven's high walls be shattered through their cope, When air elastic, by capacious clouds Absorbed redundant, once ferments abrupt, Broadening their central hollows as it spreads, And close their sides condensing, till, at length, Rends the pent power its prison, and aloft Roars o'er the world the repercussive shock.
Nor wondrous this, since, filled with vapour, e'en
The bursting bladder loud alike resounds.
Oft, too, perchance, the bickering blast itself, Borne 'gainst the clouds direct, the crash creates:
For ragged oft in various shapes they fly, Ramous and wavy, hence sonorous too;
As when the north-east whistles through the groves
The leaves all rustle, and the branches crack:
Or, haply else, the horizontal gust, Urged on abrupt, may rend the cloud in twain.
For what its force here oft on earth we learn,
On earth where gentler, but where still its rage Roots up the forest headlong from its base.
Worked into billows, too, the clouds, at times, Conflicting murmur as the torrent tide Of streams or ocean by the tempest tost.
Oft springs the roar, too, when from cloud to cloud Darts the blue lightning sudden:
these, if filled With limpid vapour, instant the fierce flash Quench with vast clamour, as the red-hot steel Fresh from the forge wide hisses when the smith Deep drowns its fury in the gelid pool.
But if the cloud be sear, with blaze abrupt Flames it sonorous;
as, when blown by storms, Fires the loose brand the laurel-crested hills, Decrepitating loud, for louder nought In conflagration crackles than the tree Sacred to PHCEBUS on the DELPHIC mount.
While not unfrequent may the din resound From ice or hail-clouds, by the whizzing wind Lashed till they fracture, and, with clattering crash, Falls the dread avalanche, down dashed amain.
But the blue lightningsprings from seeds of fire With seeds conflicting mid the war of clouds.
As when the flint with flint, or steel, contends, Swift flows the flash, and sparkles all around.
Then earlier see we, too, the rushing blaze
Than hear the roar, since far the fluent films
Of sight move speedier than of laggard sound.
As, when the woodman fells some branch remote, It drops conspicuous ere the bounding blow Strike on the ear—so the keen lightning far Anticipates the thunder, though alike Reared from one cause, from one concussion reared.
Or haply hence the winged lustre springs
Trembling amid the tempest;
that when air, Pent in the hollow of a cloud, ferments, That hollow broadening, as already sung, And close its sides condensing, the pent air Heats from its motion ;
as, from motion, heats All sight surveys;
worked oft to flame, and oR Melted, as melt the missile balls, at times, Of lead shot rapid.
Heated thus, at length, Th' expanded air bursts sudden from its tomb, Scattering long trails of corruscating fire.
Then rolls the dread explosion, after heard, Since sound than light far tardier meets the sense.
Yet scenes like these in clouds alone exist
Of utmost depth, whirled mass o'er mass immense.
Nor such conceive exist not, but that sole Breadth they possess, of substance ever void.
For mark what clouds of mountain-bulk the winds
Drive thwart the welkin when the tempests rave;
Or climb the giddy cliff, and, e'en in calms, View what vast loads, accumulated deep, Roll, tire o'er tire, through ether;
and thou, then, Must own their magnitudes, and well may'st deem
What caves stupendous through such hanging rocks Spread;
what wild winds possess them, through the storm Roaring amid their bondage, as, at night, Roar through their dens, the savage beasts of prey.
How strive they stern, now here, now there convolved, Through every point, for freedom, and the seeds
Of latent fire elicit as they roll Till the full flame concentrate, and the blaze Shoot o'er the heavens as now the big cloud bursts.
Hence, too, perchance, the golden-tressed stream
Of liquid fire through ether oft may play:
That the pure texture of the cloud itself
Holds many an igneous atom whence, when dry, Springs the bright flame, the splendid hues evinced.
For from the sun such seeds the clouds must drink, Poured down perpetual, or their rainbow skirts
No lustre e'er could redden.
These when once
To narrower spheres the lashing winds compress, Forth from their pores the radiant atoms start, And wave the serpent-brandish through the skies.
Thus springs the flash, too, when the filmy clouds Abrade beneath the whirlwind:
for, so thin Wears oft their web by friction, the red seeds Drop, unconfined, wide-glittering.
But the blaze
Then noiseless spreads, innocuous, and serene.
What next ensues, the substance what that forms
The bolt, at times, the mystic meteor shoots, This its own stroke betrays, its caustic scathe, And the foul scent of sulphur steaming round ;
Marks not of wind, or shower, but fire alone:
While, oft, the volant mischief we behold Domes, towers, and temples kindling into flame.
This igneous shaft, then, Nature rears, recluse, From subtlest fires, from atoms most minute, Vivacious most, that nought can e'er resist.
For e'en through walls it pierces, as the power
Of voice or sound, through rocks and solid brass;
The solid brass hence, instant, turned to stream.
While oft the vase it empties of its wine, Yet leaves uninjured;
loosening all around, And wide each pore relaxing, that within May wind its heat mysterious, and to seeds Primal, resolve and scatter all contained.
Effect the solar lustre in an age Could ne'er accomplish-so superior this In force severe, and keen vivacious flight.
Next whence these fires are gendered, and the power Peerless they boast e'en ramparts to subvert, Whole towns to tumble, and their splintered beams
Whirl through the heavens,—the hero's tomb dispart, Shattered to dust, and prostrate o'er the ground Sheep, and the shepherd, breathless all alike-
Whence these, and equal wonders they achieve Haste we to solve, nor longer urge delay.
From dense, dark clouds reared mass o'er mass sublime, Spring, then, these missile fires :
for when the cope Smiles all serene, or but o'ershadowed light, Such ne'er we mark ;
since daily ether first Blackens throughout, beneath the clustering crowd
So blackeis fancy might conceive all hell Had, with his direst shades, the welkin stormed, Shivering with horror every human nerve, Ere yet the tempest forge his glittering bolts.
Oft, too, o'er ocean, like a flood of pitch, Some negro cloud prone rushes from the skies, Dire leader of the darkness, followed close By hurricanes and thunders, and itself With fire surcharged, and fierce fermenting air, Driving appalled each mortal to his home.
Whence high through ether must the tempest reach, Piled cloud o'er cloud, the sun obstructing deep, Or ne'er such ten-fold darkness could be reared, Nor rush those headlong torrents that o'erpower Oft every stream, and drown the cultured plains.
These all with fires, with furious airs are filled, Whence spring the flash, and repercussive roar.
For, as we erst have sung, full many a seed Igneous, the hollow-bosomed clouds contain, And many alike absorb they from the sun.
These, when th' aerial tide, expanding still, Has from the cloud's condensing frame exprest, And with their fury its own rage combined, Then springs the fiery vortex, and within Forges profound, and points its deadly darts.
Doubly enkindled, by the boisterous air Rapid convolved, and touch of fiery seeds:
Then springs, and raves, and ripens, till, at length, Grown full mature the shackling cloud it cleaves, And down abrupt, with vibratory flash Diffused o'er all things, flings the missile fate.
Roars next the deep-toned clangour, as though heaven Through all its walls were shattered;
earth below Shakes with the mighty shock, from cloud to cloud Redoubling still through all th' infuriate vault:
While, loosened by the conflict, prone descends Th' accumulated torrent, broad and deep, As though all ether into floods were turned, And a new deluge menaced man and beast.
Such the vast uproar when the red-hot storm Bursts forth abrupt, and hurls is fiery bolts.
Oft, too, th’ external whirlwind, as it flies, Against the cloud strikes sudden, that within Holds the ripe tempest, and its form divides.
And, hence released, the fiery vortex quick, The vivid bolt, descends, now here, now there, In varying path, apportioned to its strength.
And oft the gas projected, though at first Void of combustion, in its course inflames, Rapid and long ;
forsaking, as it flies, Its grosser atoms impotent of speed, And, from th' abraded air, those more minute Collecting, prompt th' incipient blaze to rouse.
As when,swift-winged, the ball of missile lead Heats, by degrees its gross unkindling parts Losing, and fires by atoms gained from air.
Nor seldom may the stroke itself excite
The dread combustion, as with fury flies, Void of all flash, the fulminating bolt.
For, from itself, the shock may seeds alike Igneous elicit, and the substance struck,- Instant combined;
as, when with steel we ply
The sparry flint, the spark immediate springs, Nor lingers sluggish from the steel's cold touch.
So by the bolt each substance struck must flame, Inflammable if gendered ;
nor, though cold Its elemental air, can hence delay Once rise, since urged so rapid in its flight;
Flight that, if powerless of itself to fire, Alone, must warm the mischief in its fall.
So speeds th' aerial shaft, its wing so fleet, So fierce its fell encounter;
mid the clouds
So wide its infant forces it collects, And strives, impatient of restraint, t' escape!
Till, grown mature, the full-distended cloud Bursts instantaneous, and, with matchless might, Rushes the rampant meteor, as the storm Of rocks and darts, from giant-engines hurled.
Then too most light, most subtle are its seeds:
Whence nought can e'er resist it, and, with ease, Winds it, unchecked, through pores minutest traced, Void of delay, and peerless in its speed.
All, too, of weight possessed, below must tend E'en from their nature:
but when once to weight Its power propulsion adds, the substance urged
In force, in fleetness doubled must descend, Direct in travel, and more potent far Borne towards the spot that feels its final brunt.
Where long the flight, moreover, the substance winged Augments in haste, and swift, and swifter still Flows ever on, and sturdier strikes its blow:
For seed with seed condenses as they rush, Pressed to one central focus, till, at length, Falls with full force th' agglomerated shock:
Joined too, perchance, by atoms drawn from air Whose ceaseless lash gave pinions to its speed.
Then many a frame the missile bolt pervades,
And leaves unhurt, its pores the liquid fire Transpiercing unresisted;
while, reversed, Full many a frame it shatters, since the seeds Igneous with those th' objective mark that rear, And stamp it solid, in close conflict meet.
Thus brass with ease, thus, instantaneous, gold Melt its light seeds, its principles minute Deep-winding sinuous, and, when wound, at once Bursting each bond, and solving the stern mass.
But chief in autumn, and when spring expands
Her flowery carpet, earth with thunder shakes,
And heaven's high arch with trembling stars inlaid.
For few the fires that warm the wintry months,
And soft the gales of summer, nor so dense Throng then the gathering clouds ;
but, 'twixt the two When roll the zodiac-lustres, every cause Concentrates close the clamorous storm demands ;
The frith of time then reached that heat and cold Blends, whose joint power alone the flash creates, The reign of discord, and the rage of air Tumultuous torn 'twixt winds and rival fires.
For heat's first rise and cold's ulterior verge
Rear the young spring;
whence things with things diverse
Must meet, and, meeting, into wrath ferment:
While cold's first chills, and heat's last lingering beams, Mutual convolved, create th' autumnal times, Still summer striving with stern winter's rage.
Whence spring, whence autumn claim alike the term Of WARRIOR-SEASONS, thus to fight attached.
Nor wondrous, then, that thunders here should rise, And storms defile the concave, by the war Doubtful, disturbed, of whirlwind, rain, and fire.
Hence may'st thou clear the thunder's essence trace, And its vast force develope;
from thy hands Hurling the TUSCAN legends that pretend Vainly each purpose of the gods t' unfold, And thus decide whence flows this winged fire;
Where speeds its fury;
by what means empowered To pierce through walls, and then, triumphant, die;
Or what portends its brandish when displayed.
For if from JOVE, or JOVE'S associates, flow The roar tremendous, shattering heaven's high arch ;
If these, at will, the flaming bolt direct,- Why 'scapes the guilty from its vengeful stroke, Nor falls, transpierced, a monument to man ?
Or, rather, why, beneath the fiery storm, Sinks he unconscious of committed crime, Void of all blame, yet victim to its ire ?
Why seek the gods, too, solitary scenes
And labour fruitless ?
need they, then, essay
Their wontless arms, and nerve them for the fight ?
Why thus their sire's tremendous wrath exhaust
O'er the bare ground ?
or why himself permit, Nor, for his foes, the fiery bolt restrain ?
Why waves the god, moreover, the serpent-flash, Why rolls the thunder ne'er in cloudless skies ?
When throng the gathering clouds, adown the storm Descends he first, that, from a nearer point, With surer aim, his javelin he may dart ?
Yet why attack the ocean ?
o'er the waves Waste his wild ire, the floods, and liquid fields?
If, too, he mean mankind the bolt should miss, Why form its structure viewless to the sight ?
While, if he hope to strike us unprepared, Why flash, conspicuous, and invite escape ?
Why first fill heaven with groans and darkness dire ?
—Then, canst thou deem him competent at once Through various points to thunder ?
or the fact Dar’st thou deny that many a fatal bolt Falls at the same dread moment ?
while the year, Ceaseless, such fact renews, and proves precise
That as the shower at once o'er many a scene Rushes amain, so darts th' ethereal shaft.
And why, moreo'er, the temples of the gods, Why his own altars, with the fiery storm Fells he, promiscuous ?
into atoms why Rends their best statues;
and, with frantic aim, E'en from himself his image-honours wrest ?
Or o'er the hills why hurls he chief his ire, The rocks abrupt, and mountains most sublime ?
Hence, with much ease, the meteor may we trace Termed, from its essence, PRESTER by the GREEKS, That oft from heaven wide hovers o'er the deep.
Like a vast column, gradual from the skies, Prone o'er the waves, descends it;
the vext tide Boiling amain beneath its mighty whirl, And with destruction sure the stoutest ship Threatening that dares the boisterous scene approach.
Thus solve th' appearance;
that the maniac wind, In cloud tempestuous pent, when unempowered To burst its bondage, oft the cloud itself Stretches cylindric, like a spiral tube From heaven forced gradual downwards to the deep;
As though some viewless hand, its frame transpierced, With outspread palm had thrust it from above.
This, when, at length, the captived tempest rends, Forth flows it, fiery, o'er the main, and high Boils from its base th' exaggerated tide.
For, as the cone descends, from every point A dread tornado lashes it without, In gyre perpetual, through its total fall:
Till, ocean gained, the congregated storm Gives its full fury to th' uplifted waves, Tortured, and torn, loud howling midst the fray.
Oft, too, the whirlwind from the clouds around Fritters some fragments, and itself involves Deep in a cloudy pellicle, and close Mimics the prester, lengthening slow from heaven;
Till, earth attained, th' involving web abrupt Bursts,and the whirlwind vomits and the storm.
Yet, as on earth the mountains' pointed tops Break oft the texture, tubes like these, at land Far rarer form than o'er the marble main.
The rise of clouds next calls us.
When in heaven Meet various bodies subtile and sublimed, Of jagged figure, instant they cohere;
Not strong the junction, but cohesive still.
Thus spring the lighter clouds;
and these conjoined, Comprest, condensed, and congregated close, Urged by the winds, to boundless bulk augment, Till broad o'er ether frowns the finished storm.
Chief o'er the mountain-tops, as nearest heaven, In tide perpetual smoke the yellow steams
That clouds engender, here conspicuous first.
For, undiscerned at birth, the winnowing wind Here in huge masses, palpable to view, Dense, and redundant, drives them, whence aloft Mount they embodied from the humid height.
For fact itself demonstrates, as we climb
The tall, steep cliff, that breezy scenes like these Ope the best path for vapours to the skies.
Then from the seas that nature much selects
Prove the light garments fluttering o'er the strand
That catch the rising moisture;
doubtless whence Much, too, the clouds from ocean's restless brine Draw ceaseless forth, their airy base to build:
For, as the blood, so fluids all transpire.
Thus from each river, e'en from earth itself, We trace th' ascending moisture, and the mist, Like vital breath, borne upwards:
which, when once Firmly condensed, and congregated close, Veil all the heavens with clouds, and darkness deep;
While tides of rushing ether closer still Drive the light woof, and weave a thicker shade.
Then, too, perchance, the primal seeds of things, Borne from without, the mingled mass may join, And swell the cloudy drapery.
These how wide Diffused through space, how countless their amount, With what vast speed, what instantaneous flight O'erpower they every distance, we erewhile At large developed.
Nought of wonder, then, That storms, and blackness, gendered e'en above, Should oft abrupt o'er mountains, plains, and seas
Of amplest breadth, their dreary mantle stretch ;
Since through all ether's nice, innumerous pores, O'er the wide world like spiracles bespread, The thronging atoms enter and retire.
Come, now, and next, how rain in clouds sublime Forms, and o'er earth in genial showers descends, Attentive, learn.
And, first, the muse shall show That seeds at once of clouds and water rise From all created, whence alike augment Water and cloud, and all that cloud contains, As with its frame augments the vital blood, Or aught besides of moisture through the limbs.
Then, too, the cloudy floscules, as they fly O'er the broad main, the briny dew imbibe, As pendant fleeces from the new-shorn flock.
While from each stream, alike, their spongy webs Drink the light moisture ;
which, when once comprest, Atom with atom, in innumerous modes, Innumerous masses, the redundant clouds, Prest by the winds, strive doubly to discharge:
For, while such pressure bursts them, their own weight, Cloud thronged o'er cloud, compels the falling shower.
Then, too, abraded by the winnowing winds,
Or by the sun relaxed, the cloudy film Pours down its moisture, as the strainer thick
Of woof redoubled, near the solvent fire, Drops o'er the vase its juices clear-refined.
But fierce the torrent falls when fierce at once Clouds press o'er clouds, and winds with winds contend.
And much the rain persists, and long its stay, When countless crowd th' irriguous seeds above, Profuse the louring vapours, and the clouds Roll multitudinous, of bound devoid, And all the smoking earth the wet rehales.
And when the sun, amid the rushing shower, Gleams from a point all adverse to the storm, The crystal moisture, as it falls, his rays Ceaseless reflects, and rears the gaudy bow.
Thus all, through heaven, that forms or floats sublime, Or in the clouds concretes, wind, hail, and snows, And hoary pearl, and frost's stupendous power, Stern hardener of the waters, the restraint
That chains the rivers panting to be free, These all the mind may hence, with ease, unfold;
Their rise develope, why created solve, Taught by the seeds that form their various frames.
Next learn the cause why earth's firm frame, at times, Quakes wide around.
And, first, conceive her shaped Below as upwards ;
filled with roaring winds, Fissures, and caverns, crags, and pools profound, And fractured rocks, through all her bosom spread:
While, mid her hollows, boundless rivers roll, Wave after wave, and hide their secret heads :
For fact itself proves earth throughout the same.
These truths premised, earth trembles, then, profound, Shook into ruins, when the rage of time, Deep down the caves immensely scooped below, Tumbles th' incumbent hills ;
abrupt they fall With vast concussion, while, from scene to scene, Winds the dread tremour, propagated quick:
And well may wind ;
since e'en the sluggish wain, Though filled but half, as o'er the street it rolls, Shakes every mansion;
since, alike disturbed, Quake they when, near, the light aerial car Drawn by fleet coursers whirls its rattling wheels.
Earth trembles, too, when, undermined by age, Wide into lakes of boundless breadth beneath Th' incumbent glebe sinks sudden, her vast shell
By the deep dash far staggered, as the bowl Reels, filled with fluid, when its fluid rocks.
And when the winds, that oft her hollows crowd, Rush all collected, with fermenting force, Towards one vext quarter,-where the fight prevails Earth nods o'erpowered;
each building reared above Totters throughout, while those of loftier height Dread instant ruin, their connecting beams Disjointed, torn, and tumbling from their posts.
And shrink mankind, then, from the creed that soon Some ruthless conflict the wide world itself
Shall crush with wreck unbounded-while they see Earth shook so largely through her inmost mass ?
E’en now, should ne'er such winds their rage relax, Their boisterous ferment, nought of power opposed Could stem th' assault, and instant fate must flow.
But as, by turns, these labour, and forbear, Now firm advance, and now, exhausted, fly, Earth ofter far is menaced than destroyed.
For, from her centre thrown, she straight returns.
Confirms her balance, and her course resumes;
While, mid the shock, each building reels;
the high Most, less the low, the lowliest least of all.
Hence, too, the mighty tremour:
that when wind, Or air elastic, into tumult worked, Upreared within, or entering from above, Still towards one point of earth's vast caverns pours, Whirled in wild vortex, its enormous force
At length bursts sudden—and the solid soil Fractures amain, with broad tremendous yawn.
Such SYRIAN SIDON saw, and ÆGIUMsuch, Pride of MOREAN plains.
What earthquakes dire, What towns overthrown has this disruption sole
Of frantic air engendered !
what vast walls
Have tumbled from their base !
what peopled ports
Deep down the main in common ruin sunk !
E'en should th' elastic vapour the stern soil Cleave not abrupt, yet, issuing through its pores, Earth trembles still, with quivering horror shook, As shakes the frame, through every limb convulsed, When cold severe assaults us unprepared.
A twofold terror, then, mankind appals ;
Above, the buildings menace, and, below, The shuddering ground threats instant into depths Boundless to sink, or ope its giant jaws And, in a moment, swallow all that lives.
E'en those who hold that heaven and earth exist Each incorrupt, and of eternal date, Touched by the present danger, then betray Strong latent dread lest earth forsake their feet, Down plunging headlong to th' abyss below;
Lest nature fail, and, o'er the total world, Void of all bounds promiscuous ruin rush.
Next why the main overflows not let us solve.
And, first, man wondrous deems it the hoarse fall
Of mountain cataracts, the ceaseless press
Of streams innumerous from innumerous points, Year after year, its limits never swell.
Yet add to these whate'er from heaven descends
In showers and tempests, scattered wide alike O'er earth and ocean, every fountain add, And still the vast accumulated mass, Weighed with the deep, would scarce a drop exceed.
Whence nought stupendous that it ne'er augments.
Next, daily, much the solar heat exhales.
For as the sun o'er humid garments pours
His beams profuse, with instant haste they dry.
But broad and spacious spreads the liquid main ;
Whence, from each spot though small the lymph absorbed, Yet large th' amount its total surface yields.
Then, too, the flickering winds with ceaseless wing Winnow an ample portion.
Such their power Oft, in a night, the swampiest paths they cleanse, Brush off the wet, and harden all the mire.
And earlier have we taught that every cloud Imbibes, luxurious, the redundant dew Raised from the face of ocean ;
and o'er earth, Lashed by the breeze, in copious showers distils.
And as this mass terrene of frame consists Porous throughout, and with a thousand coasts Girds all the deep-since to the deep it sends, In part, its fluids, doubtless so, alike, Part still retreats, and, percolated pure, Fresh bubbles distant at some fountain-head.
Whence winds again the dulcet tide through paths
Its liquid feet have printed oft before.
Now next explain we whence, from ÆTNA’S jaws, Bursts the bright storm of wild projectile fire ;
Storm that, once kindled o'er SICILIANS plains, Raves with no common ruin, as around From many a realm the general eye it draws, And strikes the general heart with dread severe, Wondering, beneath the dingy-flaring cope, What new adventure Nature means t' achieve.
Such facts t' unfold thy mind must deep, and wide.
And long expatiate o'er their separate parts;
Recall the doctrine that th' ENTIRE OF THINGS Throughout is boundless;
and how small, reflect, One system sole when with th' ENTIRE compared With systems thronging;
systems so complex
That each to all weighs less than man to earth.
A creed once rooted that will raise thee oft O'er vulgar wonders, and each fact evolve.
Who strange conceives it that this mortal frame
Should rage, at times, with fever, or aught else
Of keen disease through all the body spread ?
That gout the foot should madden ?
ache severe
Torture the teeth, or wound the visual orb ?
Or that the hallowed erysipelas
O'er every limb should trail his serpent fires ?
Here nought lurks wondrous:
for from various seeds
Spring they, contest, in various modes combined;
While heaven and earth alone such seeds adverse Amply supply to rear the tyrant ill.—
Deem, then, alike, that heaven and earth themselves Draw from the boundless whole the stores evinced
When, with wild horror, quakes the world abrupt;
O'er earth and main when rushing whirlwinds sweep, Or heaven inflames with fires from AETNA thrown.
For heaven thus blazes from the seeds of fire Countless collected, as the ponderous storm Falls in full shower when aqueous atoms throng.“
But far too vast the sparkling deluge poured!"
And vast alike to him the stream must flow, In earlier life who ne'er so vast has seen:
And vast each tree, each sentient tribe, and all Till now ne'er witnessed;
while each sight so vast, While heaven, earth, main, united ne'er augment
The boundless compass of th' unbounded whole.
Explain we, then, from ÆTNA’S forge immense
How flows the fiery deluge when enraged.
And, first, the mighty mount is scooped throughout.
High arched with sparry columns:
winds and airs
Fill all its caves, for agitated air To wind converts, resistless in its might.
This, when once heated, and its torrid breath Has heated, too, the mingled mass around Of rocks, and earths sulphureous, and a flood Of frantic flame engendered—bursts abrupt, And, through the mountain's monster-jaws, ejects Towards every point its embers, and its blaze;
Belches whole atmospheres of smoke, and high Hurls from its base huge crags of weight immense.
To air incensed such wonders, all, resolve.
Then to the main, too, spreads th' enormous hill Its roots profound, the rough, rebellowing surge Baffling at each encounter:
for thus far Doubtless extend its glimmering halls, and hence Draws it, at times, fresh stores of maddening wind;
An ampler storm hence brewing, and its flames, Its rocks, its sands projecting wider still:
While, at its top, the whirlwind craters throng, By us termed aptly its voracious jaws.
Thus many a cause we bring;
for many a cause
Oft it behoves us, though but one subsist.
As when, at distance, some dead corse thou view'st Stretched o'er the ground, full many a cause thy mind Must state whence fell it ere it state the true.
For whether poison triumph or disease, Cold, or the sword, it ne'er can prove remote;
Though of such deaths thou learn, from those informed, One here prevail.
-Thus judge of things at large.
The NILE now calls us, pride of EGYPT'S plains:
Sole stream on earth its boundaries that o'erflows Punctual, and scatters plenty.
When the year Now glows with perfect summer, leaps its tide Broad o'er the champaign, for the north-wind now, Th' ETESIAN breeze, against its mouth direct Blows with perpetual winnow ;
every surge Hence loiters slow, the total current swells, And wave o'er wave its loftiest bank surmounts.
For that the fixt monsoon that now prevails Flows from the cold stars of the northern pole None e'er can doubt;
while rolls the Nile adverse Full from the south, from realms of torrid heat, Haunts of the ETHlOP-tribes;
yet far beyond First bubbling, distant, o'er the burning line.
Then ocean, haply, by th' undevious breeze Blown up its channel, heaves with every wave Heaps of high sands, and dams its wonted course.
Whence narrower, too, its exit to the main, And with less force the tardy stream descends.
Or, towards its fountain, ampler rains, perchance Fall, as th' ETESIAN fans, now wide unfurled, Ply the big clouds perpetual from the north Far o'er the red equator;
where, condensed, Ponderous, and low, against the hills they strike, And shed their treasures o'er the rising flood.
Or, from the ETHIOP-mountains, the bright sun Now full matured, with deep dissolving ray May melt th' agglomerate snows, and down the plains Drive them, augmenting, hence, th' incipient stream.
But come, th' AVERNI beckon;
and the muse
Their nature, next, their depths, their lakes shall pierce.
And first, their name from power adverse to birds
Draw they:
for when the feathery people once Touch but their confines, instant they forget
Their pinioned oars, their plumy sails relax, And down, plumb down, profuse, with fluent neck Plunge they to earth, if earth their bottom form, Or into pools, if pool the mystic depth.
Such the dread gulf at CUMÆ, belching high Fumes of hot sulphur o'er the mountains round.
Such, too, at ATHENS, deep within her walls, Steams from the tower, MINERVA'S temple near ;
Where never raven, e'en when victims smoke O'er the red altar, shows his jetty plumes.
Yet not restrained, as GRECIAN poets sing, By wrath of PALLAS o'er the tell-tale spy Profusely lavished, but the place alone.
Such place in SYRIA, too, as fame reports, The traveller traces, o'er whose dire domains
The brute that treads drops instant, as though felled In prompt oblation to th' infernal powers.
These all subsist from Nature's general laws, And whence their source their earliest rise unfolds
Lest we should judge them the first gates of hell, And through such portals deem th' infernal gods
Draw the pale spirit to the shades below;
As, with their breath, the foot-winged deer, 'tis said, Draw from the furze the spotted race of snakes;
A creed how false our numbers now shall prove.
First we maintain, then, and have earlier oft Maintained the same, that Nature's primal seeds
In shape wide vary, whence the frame of things Much holds nutritious, baneful much, and big With certain fate;
while different foods, to kinds Different themselves, an ampler nurture yield, As reared with bond, with texture reared unlike.
This have we erst decided.
Sounds abhorred
Wound the vext ear;
the shuddering nostrils drink
Oft atoms harsh and hateful to their smell;
Nor fewer far the bodies touch rejects;
Hostile to sight, or grievous to the taste.
Then, too, how frequent things with power adverse, Noxious to life, e'en man himself oppress.
Thus there are trees whose shade malignant strikes With instant head-ache all, in idle hour, Who loosely throw them on the grass beneath.
While some, o'er HELICON, a blossom bear Of scent so deadly, few the smell survive.
These spring from earth ;
for earth within her holds Innumerous seeds of things innumerous, joined In countless modes, and yields them as they blend.
The midnight taper, as its dying snuff Pours o'er the nostrils, stupifies with sleep Deep as, the brain, when apoplexy numbs.
So stupid swoons the maid, too, who in hour Of full, overflowing nature, castor gross Scents, floating round;
and from her graceful hands Drops, loosely drops the polished work she plies.
But endless are the substances that, thus, Melt all the members, and the soul subvert.
If long thou loiter in the public bath, Or bathe at home overloaded with repast, Wilt thou not faint, unsinewed by the warmth ?
Dies not each sense beneath the charcoal-fame
If from the brook we drink not ere they fail ?
While the foul gas, that from fermenting must Springs, like a blow deep stuns us with its force.
Then breeds not earth, imbedded in herself, Bitumens, sulphurs, ever steaming forth
In dews malignant ?
from the mines profound
Of gold, or silver, rise not such o'er those
Who delve, unblest, amid their rigid veins ?
What ills hence issue !
o'er the miner's limbs
What ghastly hues !
what horrors o'er his face!
Hast thou not heard how soon existence fails, How languid life, mid wretches thus condemned ?-
These vapours all earth genders in herself, And breathes through many an opening to the day.
Thus breathe th' AVERNI through their openings dire Fumes reared from earth, and fatal found to birds, Tainting far round the heavenly breeze that blows.
Here, as the plumy people first approach, The fluent bane arrests them, and below Deep plunges headlong down th' envenomed gulf, Where their last pulse soon fails through every limb.
A wontless thrill, a giddiness of brain First feel they, falling, till, profounder sunk, Life flows amain, since more condensed th' assault.
Then, too, perchance th' AVERNI may, at times, With deadly blast the total air dissolve, Full nigh to vacuum, 'twixt the flutterer spread And earth beneath;
whence, once the spot attained, Vain prove his wings, each utmost effort vain To prop the parent body :
robbed abrupt
Of buoyant ether, powerless, and forlorn, Down, like a weight, he tumbles through the void, And from each pore his airy soul exhales.
In wells profound the gurgling lymph that springs, Springs chilliest in the summer :
-for all earth Expands beneath the sun-beams, and emits
The seeds of fire far prompter to the day:
Whence more her surface burns with heat evolved, And colder flows the fountain deep-concealed.
While, mid the wintry frosts, her frame contracts, Condenses closer, and, condensing, strains the fiery atoms into caves and wells.
A fount, 'tis rumoured, near the temple purls Of JOVE AMMONIAN, tepid through the night, And cold at noon-day:
and th' astounded sage Stares at the fact, and deems the punctual sun Strikes through the world's vast centre, as the shades
Of midnight shroud us, and with ray reverse Maddens the well-spring:
—creed absurd and false.
For if, full blazing o'er the naked tide, Poured from above in fierce meridian might, No heat he gender-how can his deep orb Flame through earth's solid substance, and the lymph Lash into fervour ?
how-since e'en at noon Scarce can his rage the cottage wall transpierce ?
Dost thou the cause demand, then ?
clearly hence.
That round the fountain earth more spongy spreads
And seeds of fire throng ampler;
whence, when night Pours o'er the world his dew-distilling shades, The chilled, contracting soil here strains abrupt, As though comprest by fingers, towards the fount Such seeds profusely, and the bubbling wave Proves to the touch, the taste more tepid proves.
But when, reversed, the sun with new-born beam Earth rarefies, and quickens, back profound
Fly the young fire-seeds to their native haunts, The fount forsaking;
whence the sparkling tide Tastes in the day more frigid than at night.
Then, too, the crystal fluid, by the sun Thrilled, deep dilates beneath his trembling ray, And yields its embryo fires ;
as, when congealed, Yields it alike its frost beneath the blaze, Melts all its ice, and every bondage bursts.
A fount there is, too, which, though cold itself, With instant flare the casual flax inflames Thrown o'er its surface;
and the buoyant torch Kindles alike immediate, o'er its pool Steering the course th' ethereal breeze propels.
Nor wondrous this;
for countless seeds of heat Throng through the water, raised from earth profound, And thence, in turn, projected into air Yet ne'er so active as the wave to warm.
Some latent energy the seeds, moreover, Thus scattered, forces to the water's brim Sudden, and there concentrates;
as, at times, Springs the fresh fount amid th* unbounded main, And drives the brine broad circling as it flows.
Nor thus unfrequent to the thirsty crew Does bounteous nature ope the dulcet draught, High-spouting freshness through the world of salt.
So through the well-spring that the flax inflames Burst forth the lurking fire-seeds to the day, Commingling with its fibres;
which achieved, Or with the torch once blended, all is blaze;
Themselves alike high-charged with latent fire.
When, just extinct, the taper we apply
To one full blazing, seest thou not how soon, E'en ere it touch, th' extinguished snuff relumes ?
Relumes not thus the torch, too ?
and alike Full many a substance, useless to recount, At distance kindled ere the flame arrive ?
acts the fountain, such the cause concealed.
And next explain we by what curious law
The stone termed MAGNET by the GREEKS, attracts Th' obsequious iron;
magnet termed since first Mid the MAGNETES men its power descried.
Vast is the wonder, mid th' admiring crowd, This stone excites;
for oft a pendant chain Forms it of rings unlinked and loosely joined.
And frequent see they, sporting in the breeze, Such rings quintupled, in succession long, The lowlier cleaving to the sphere above, And this to that, proclaiming, as it hangs, Its deep-felt conscience of the magnet's power.
Such the resistless energy it boasts.
In facts like these full many a truth profound First must we prove, ere yet their power thou trace, And many a maze unravel ;
-thou with heed List, then, for now thy closest ear we claim.
And, first, from all things bodies most minute Flow forth for ever, scattered, and diffused, Wounding the pupil, and compelling sight.
From forms defined spring odours ;
from the sun
Thus heat exhales ;
cold, dewy damp from streams,
And the rough spray from ocean, with fierce fang Gnawing the mound that dares resist its waves.
Thus sounds, too, flutter through the breezy air;
And when the beach we traverse, oft the tongue Smarts with the briny vapour;
or, at hand, If the bruised wormwood yield its acrid juice, We taste th' essential bitter and abhor.
Thus some light effluence streams from all create, Streams forth for ever, void of dull repose, Towards every point diffused;
for man perceives, Where'er his station ;
sight alike exists, The sense of fluent odours, and of sounds.
This thus premised, recall we next to mind
How rare the frame of all things, as erewhile Conspicuous proved we in our earliest strain.
A theme, though ever useful, useful most Found, when compelled, as now, to re-affirm That nought exists but matter mixt with void.
For, first, the roofs of rocky caverns sweat With dews, and crystals;
and the frame of man Throws through each pore the perspirable lymph.
Beard through the visage permeates, through each limb
Peeps the young down, and every meal imbibed Flows through the veins profuse, and feeds, augments, And quickens all things e'en to th' utmost nails.
Cold the tense brass, and heat alike transpierce:
So pierce they gold, and silver, as the vase Proves, filled with fluids by the fingers clasped.
Through the stone wall voice winds its sinuous way, And frosts, and odours, and the power of heat:
Heat that pervades e'en steel, and through the helm Rushes, where rests it round the fretted neck.
So rushes, too, contagion from without Deep through each quivering organ.
The red storm
In heaven engendered pierces earth profound ;
Or, if in earth it ripen, heaven above Shakes with the shock through all its shattering walls.
For nought combines through nature void of pores.
Then not unvarying in exterior shape
All atoms flow from all things;
nor alike
On all things act they, with effect unchanged.
The beam that barns and dries the moistened earth, Fluxes the frost, o'er mountains piled sublime Rolls, in loose tide, the macerated snows, And with its effluence melts th' adhesive wax.
Fire fuses gold and copper, but contracts
The flesh of beeves and shrivels their tough hides.
Red from the flame, steel hardens in the pool, But hides and flesh relax.
The bearded goat
On the wild olive most luxurious feasts, Deems it all nectar, all ambrosia deems, While nought so hateful to the mouth of man.
Swine fly perfumes, sweet marjoram is death, Scents that, with us, the spirit oft revive.
While the gross slough, mere filth among ourselves, To them proves cleanliness;
and deep within Plunge they, all joyous mid its miry waves.
This, too, the muse should notice ere we yet Full on the magnet enter;
that, as things
Oft various classes hold of pores within, Each class from each must differ, and a breadth, A shape possess, appropriate to itself.
For many a sense each vital tribe endows, Various, empowered as various parts t' achieve And mark its proper objects as they rise.
Thus sounds by one assail us, this conveys Taste from each juice, and streams of odour that.
So the firm stone some substances transpierce, Some wood, some gold, some silver, crystal some, Heat those pervading, the light image this.
And thus through all things different objects rush With ease far different;
nature to their forms, Their powers diverse, as long anterior proved, Th' appropriate duct adapting most exact.
These axioms thus premised, then, and maintained, All else flows obvious, and the total cause Unfolds spontaneous that the steel compels.
First, from the magnet countless atoms stream
In tide perpetual, chasing the mid air Twixt the stern iron placed, and stone itself.
This space once emptied, and a total void Formed broad between, abrupt the seeds of steel, Thrown forth alike, usurp it, close conjoined, Dragging the ring resistless as they rush.
For nought exists with primal seeds more harled, More clinched, more tangled in commutual bonds
Than the cold steel, all horror to the touch.
Whence wondrous less the doctrine thus announced, That from the steel those atoms ne'er can part, Urged through the vacuum, but the ring succeeds:
Abrupt succeeds it, gains the stone abrupt, And fixt and firm in mystic league coheres.
So flies it, too, towards every point alike, Borne upwards, or transverse, where'er the void Spreads round the magnet, following, in its course, The seeds that nearest touch the vacant sphere, Themselves hence foremost prest from strife within, And powerless, else, through ether e'er t' ascend.
Hence, too, the ring draws pinions in its flight:
That as, at once, secedes th' anterior air, And forms the void, th' elastic tide behind Drives it, perpetual plying at its back.
For air encircles all things ;
but alone Can act coercive, and the steel protrude, When first the momentary void exists, Opes its pure passage, and admits it free.
Then potent acts it;
through the total ring, Through every pore, its puny atoms darts, Chasing the steel as winds the bark impel.
Then air, moreover, whatever exists, within Holds, doubtless ;
since of tenuous frame composed, And by surrounding air for ever lashed.
Whence air through iron roves, too, deep-concealed, Ceaseless in action, and the docile ring Plies with internal tempest, doubly hence Borne towards the void where centres all its aim;
Armed with new speed, new succour for the flight.
Oft from the magnet, too, the steel recedes, Repelled by turns, and re-attracted close.
And oft in brazen vessels may we mark Ringlets of SAMOTHRACE, or fragments fine Struck from the valid iron, bounding high When close below the magnet points its powers.
So vast th' aversion, e'en the brass beneath, Feel they at times ;
the discord such induced.
Thou thus resolve the problem :
that the brass
First throws, as nearest, its attenuate breath, And fills the pores of iron ;
which when, next, The stream magnetic reaches, it in vain Toils to transpierce, each avenue possest.
Checked in its course, with wave perpetual, hence, The rings, the raspings beats it, and above Far off repulses, else embracing strong.
Nor strange conceive it the magnetic stream Nought drives besides:
for powers there are resist, Like the firm gold, confiding in their weight;
While some a frame so loose present and rare
The rushing vapour permeates, void of touch.
Such frame all timbers offer.
But the steel Springs 'twixt the two:
and hence, when through its pores Clogged with the brass effluvium, the full flood Flung from the magnet dashes it sublime.
Nor are such unions through created things Discerned unfrequent, nor severe the task
To point affinities of equal strength.
Lime only stones connects ;
the strong steer-glue Joins planks so firm, a bond so valid rears, The closest-textured table through its veins Will easier sever than the glue desist.
The vine's pure juice in close alliance dares League with the fountain;
while the ponderous pitch
The light-winged oil refuses.
With the fleece
The purple murex so minutely blends
Nought e'er can part them:
no-though e'en thou toil Day after day with all great NEPTUNE'S waves:
No-his whole sea the stain would ne'er wash out.
One cement sole with gold concentrates gold, And nought but pewter brass with brass unites.
Such facts how numerous !
but why more recite ?
To thee 'twere labour useless, and perplext;
And. to the muse unjust;
for much remains, Much, though but few the numbers we design.
Where things once fit with textures reared reverse, Rare and o'ercharged, and this to that, and that Responds to this, alternate, they combine With firmest junction:
but combine they, too, Oft as though hooks and ringlets formed the bond:
And thus, perchance, the magnet meets the steel.
Now whence diseases rise, the morbid power
What, that, once gendered, spreads its baneful blast O'er man's pale offspring, and the brutal throngs, Next will we sing.
Already hast thou heard
That seeds exist, from many a substance flung, To life salubrious, yet, too oft, reversed, Noxious, and big with death.
When spring the last Through heaven full flocking, all the vital air Sickens immediate, through its texture changed.
And thus full flock they, their pestiferous power Fanning around them, from intrinsic birth
In heaven itself begot as mists or clouds;
Or breathed from earth, when once her soddened soil Ferments corrupted, plied by ceaseless rains Untimely poured, and hot succeeding suns.
Seest thou not, oft, the restless crowds that rove Far from their homes, their countries, tried severe
With the new stream they drink, the heaven inhale ?
From the dread change such sickness sole results.
How wide must BRITAIN differ in her clime From EGYPT'S tribes, o'er whom the northern pole Gleams never!
orient PONTUS, how, from those Far westward, scattered o'er the GADIAN isles, Or the swart ETHIOP, blackening in his blaze!
And since the world's vast quarters, each from each, As various heavens and atmospheres divide, So man himself in tincture, face, and form Alike must vary, and disease sustained.
High up the NILE, mid EGYPT'S central plains, Springs the dread leprosy, and there alone.
Gout clogs the feet in ATTICA;
the sight Fails in ACHAIA :
different regions, thus, With different organs wage eternal war, As urged by atmospheres of frame unlike.
But when the heaven, of poisonous power to us First moves remote, its hostile effluence creeps Slow, like a mist or vapour ;
all around Transforming as it passes, till, at length, Reached our own region, it the total scene Taints, and assimilates, and loads with death.
Abrupt then falls the new, pestiferous bane, Broad o'er the fountains, or the food invades Of man, or beast, the pasture or the grain.
Or, haply, still along the breezy air It floats commingled;
whence, with every breath, Drink we alike the poison through our veins.
And hence the murrain that assaults, at times, The lusty herd, the blight that thins our flecks.
Nor aught imports it whether, urged by gain,
We change the covering of the skies, and seek Ourselves the noxious climate, or its breeze Meet us spontaneous;
or aught else assail Of nature new, and strange to every sense.
A plague like this, a tempest big with fate, Once ravaged ATHENS, and her sad domains ;
Unpeopled all her city, and her paths Swept with destruction.
For amid the realms Begot of EGYPT, many a mighty tract
Of ether traversed, many a flood o'erpast, At length, here fixed it;
o'er the hapless realm Of CECROPS hovering, and th' astonished race Dooming by thousands to disease and death.
The head first flamed with inward heat;
the eyes Reddened with fire suffused;
the purple jaws Sweated with bloody ichor;
ulcers foul Crept o’e the vocal path, obstructing close;
And the prompt tongue, expounder of the mind, Overflowed with gore, enfeebled in its post, Hoarse in its accent, harsh beneath the touch.
And when the morbid effluence through the throat Had reached the lungs, and filled the faltering heart, Then all the powers of life were loosened;
forth Crept the spent breath most fetid from the mouth, As steams the putrid carcass:
every power Failed through the soul-the body-and alike Lay they liquescent at the gates of death.
While with these dread, insufferable ills A restless anguish joined, companion close, And sighs commixt with groans;
and hiccough deep, And keen convulsive twitchings ceaseless urged, Day after day, o'er every tortured limb, The wearied wretch still wearying with assault.
Yet ne'er too hot the system could'st thou mark Outwards, but rather tepid to the touch :
Tinged still with purple-dye, and brandished o'er With trails of caustic ulcers, like the blaze Of erysipelas.
But all within Burned to the bone;
the bosom heaved with flames Fierce as a furnace, nor would once endure
The lightest vest thrown loosely o'er the limbs.
All to the winds, and many to the waves, Careless, resigned them ;
in the gelid stream Plunging their fiery bodies, to be cooled :
While some, wide-gasping, into wells profound Rushed all abrupt;
and such the red-hot thirst Unquenchable that parched them, amplest showers Seemed but as dew-drops to th' unsated tongue.
Nor e'er relaxed the sickness ;
the racked frame Lay all-exhausted, and, in silence dread, Appalled, and doubtful, mused the HEALING ART.
For the broad eye-balls, burning with disease, Rolled in full stare, for ever void of sleep, And told the pressing danger;
nor alone Told it, for many a kindred symptom thronged.
The mind's pure spirit, all despondent, raved;
The brow severe;
the visage fierce and wild;
The ears distracted, filled with ceaseless sounds;
Frequent the breath;
or ponderous oft, and rare;
The neck with pearls bedewed of glistening sweat;
Scanty the spittle, thin, of saffron dye, Salt, with hoarse cough scarce laboured from the throat.
The limbs each trembled;
every tendon twitched Spread o'er the hands;
and from the feet extreme
O'er all the frame a gradual coldness crept.
Then, towards the last, the nostrils close collapsed;
The nose acute;
eyes hollow;
temples scooped;
Frigid the skin, retracted;
o'er the mouth A ghastly grin ;
the shrivelled forehead tense;
The limbs outstretched, for instant death prepared;
Till with the eighth descending sun, for few Reached his ninth lustre, life for ever ceased.
And though, at times, th' infected death escaped From sanious organs, or the lapse profuse
Of black-tinged feces, fate pursued them still.
Hectic and void of strength, consumption pale Preyed on their vitals;
or, with head-ache keen, Oft from the nostrils tides of blood corrupt Poured unrestrained, and wasted them to shades.
And, e'en o'er these triumphant, frequent still Fixed the morbific matter on the limbs, Or seized the genial organs;
and to some
The grave so hideous, they consented life E'en with th' excision of their sexual powers Dearly to ransom:
some their being bought
By loss of feet or hands;
and some escaped Void of all vision;
such their dread of death.
And in oblivion some so deep were drowned Themselves they knew not, nor their lives elapsed.
And though, unburied, corse o'er corse the streets
Oft thronged promiscuous, still the plumy tribes, The forest monsters, either far aloof Kept, the foul stench repulsing, or if once Dared they the plunder, instant fate pursued.
Nor feathery flocks at noon, nor beasts at night Their native woods deserted;
with the pest Remote they languished, and full frequent died.
But chief the dog his generous strength resigned, Tainting the highways, while the ruthless bane Through every limb his sickening spirit drove.
With eager strife th' enormous grave was snatched, By friends untended:
nor was aught of cure Discerned specific ;
for what here recalled To day's bright regions the vanescent soul, And gave the living ether to the lips, Proved poison there, and ten-fold stamped the fate.
But this the direst horror, that when once Man felt th' infection, as though full forewarned
Of sure destruction, melancholy deep Preyed o'er his heart, his total courage failed, Death sole he looked for, and his doom was death.
Thus seized the dread, unmitigated pest Man after man, and day succeeding day, With taint voracious:
like the herds they fell
Of bellowing beeves, or flocks of timorous sheep:
On funeral funeral hence for ever piled.
E'en he who fled th' afflicted, urged by love
Of life too fond, and trembling for his fate, Repented soon severely, and himself Sunk in his guilty solitude, devoid Of friends, of succour, hopeless, and forlorn.
While those who nursed them, to the pious task Roused by their prayers, with piteous moans commixt, Fell irretrievable:
the best, by far, The worthiest, thus most frequent met their doom.
From ceaseless sepulchres, where each with each Vied in the duteous labour, they returned Faint, sad, and weeping;
and from grief alone Oft to their beds resistless were they driven.
Nor lived the mortal then, who ne'er was tried With death, with sickness, or severest woe.
Then the rude herdsman, shepherd, and the man
Of sturdiest strength, who drove the plough afield, Languished remote;
and in their wretched cots Sunk, the sad victims of disease and want:
O'er breathless sires their breathless offspring lay, Or sires and mothers o'er the race they bore.
Nor small the misery through the city oft
That poured from distant hamlets;
for in throngs Full flocked the sickening peasants for relief From every point diseased ;
and every space, And every building crowded;
heightening hence
The rage of death, the hillocks of the dead.
Some, parched with thirst, beneath th' eternal spout Dropped of the public conduits ;
in the stream Wallowing unwearied, and its dulcet draught Deep-drinking till they bursted.
Staggering, some Threw o'er the highways, an:
!
the streets they trod,
Their languid limbs;
already half extinct, Horrid with fetor, stiff with blotches foul, With rags obscene scarce covered;
o'er the bones Skin only, nought but skin;
and drowned alike Within and outwards, with putrescent grume.
At length the temples of the gods themselves, Changed into charnels, and their sacred shrines Thronged with the dead:
for superstition now, The power of altars, half their sway had lost, Whelmed in the pressure of the present woe.
Nor longer now the costly rites prevailed
Of ancient burial, erst punctilious kept:
For all roved restless, with distracted mind, From scene to scene ;
and worn with grief and toil Gave to their friends th' interment chance allowed.
And direst exigence impelled them oft, Headlong, to deeds most impious;
for the pyres Funereal seized they, reared not by themselves, And with loud dirge, and wailing wild, o'er these Placed their own dead;
amid th' unhallowed blaze With blood contending, rather than resign
The tomb thus gained, or quit th' enkindling corse.
