born at Aquinum, an inconsiderable town of the Volsci, about the year of Christ 38.2", "1": "He was either the son, or the foster-son, of a wealthy freedman, who gave him a liberal education.", "2": "From the period of his birth, till he had attained the age of forty, nothing more is known of him than that he continued to perfect himself in the study of eloquence, by declaiming, according to the practice of those days ;", "3": "yet more for his own amusement, than from any intention to prepare himself either for the schools or the courts of law.", "4": "About this time he seems to have discovered his true bent, and be­ taken himself to poetry.", "5": "Domitian was now at the head of the government, and showed symptoms of reviving that system of favouritism which had nearly ruined the empire under Claudius, by his unbounded partiality for a young pantomime dancer of the name of Paris.", "6": "Against this minion, Juvenal seems to have directed the first shafts of that satire which was destined to make the most powerful vices tremble, and shake .", "7": "the masters of the world on their thrones.", "8": "He composed a few lines1 on the influence of Paris, with considerable success, which encouraged him to cultivate this kind of poetry :", "9": "he had the prudence, however, not to trust himself to an auditory, in a reign which swarmed with informers ;", "10": "and his compositions were, therefore, secretly handed about amongst his friends.", "11": "1", "12": "By degrees he grew bolder;", "13": "and, having made many large additions to his first sketch, or perhaps re-cast it, produced what is now called his Seventh Satire, which he recited to a numerous assemblage.", "14": "The consequences were such as he had probably anticipated:", "15": "Paris, informed of the part which he bore in it, was seriously offended, and complained to the emperor, who, as the old account has it, sent the author, by an easy kind of punishment, into Egypt with a military com­ mand.", "16": "To remove such a man from his court must undoubt­ edly have been desirable to Domitian ;", "17": "and, as he was spoken of with kindness in the same Satire, which is entirely free from political allusions, the \" facetiousness \" of the punishment (though Domitian's was not a facetious reign) renders the fact not altogether improbable.", "18": "Yet, when we consider that these reflections on Paris could scarcely have been published before LXXXIV., and that the favourite was disgraced and put to death almost immediately after, we shall be inclined to doubt whether his banishment actually took place;", "19": "or, if it did, whether it was of any long duration.", "20": "That Juvenal was in Egypt is certain ;", "21": "but he might have gone there from motives of personal safety, or, as Salmasius has it, of curiosity.", "22": "How­ ever this may be, it does not appear that he was ever long absent from Rome, where a thousand internal marks clearly show that all his Satires were written.", "23": "But whatever punish­ ment might have followed the complaint of Paris, 1 it had no other effect on our author, than that of increasing his hatred of tyranny, and turning his indignation upon the emperor himself, whose hypocrisy, cruelty, and licentiousness, became, from that period, the object of his keenest reprobation.", "24": "He profited, indeed, so far by his danger or his punishment, as to recite no more in public;", "25": "but he continued to write during the remainder of Domitian's reign, in which he finished, as I conceive, his second, third,1 fifth, sixth,2 apd perhaps thir- teenth1 Satires ;", "26": "the eighth2 I have always looked upon as his first.", "27": "In xcv., when Juvenal was in his 54th year, Domitian ban­ ished the philosophers from Rome, and soon after from Italy, with many circumstances of cruelty;", "28": "an action, for which, I am sorry to observe, he is covertly praised by Quintilian.", "29": "Though Juvenal, strictly speaking, did not come under the description of a philosopher, yet, like the hare in the fable, he might not unreasonably entertain some apprehensions for his safety, and, with many other persons eminent for learning and virtue, judge it prudent to withdraw from the city.", "30": "To this period I have always inclined to fix his journey to Egypt.", "31": "Two years afterwards the world was happily relieved from the tyranny of Domitian;", "32": "and Nerva, who succeeded him, recalled the exiles.", "33": "From this time there remains little doubt of Juvenal's being at Rome, where he continued his studies in tranquillity.", "34": "His first Satire after the death of Domitian, seems to have been what is now called the fourth.", "35": "About this time, too, he probably thought of revising and publishing those which he had already written ;", "36": "and composed or completed that intro­ ductory piece,' which now stands at the head of his works.", "37": "As the order is every where broken in upon, it is utterly im­ possible to arrange them chronologically;", "38": "but I am inclined to think that the eleventh Satire closed his poetical career.", "39": "All else is conjecture;", "40": "but in this he speaks of himself as an old man, \" Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula solem and indeed he had now passed his grand climacteric.", "41": "This is all that can be collected of the life of Juvenal;", "42": "and how much of this is built upon uncertainties !", "43": "I hope, how­ ever, that it bears the stamp of probability;", "44": "which is all I contend for;", "45": "and which, indeed, if I do not deceive myself, is somewhat more than can be affirmed of what has been hitherto delivered on the subject.", "46": "Little is known of Juvenal's circumstances;", "47": "but, happily, that little is authentic, as it comes from himself.", "48": "He had a competence.", "49": "The dignity of poetry is never disgraced in him, as it is in some of his contemporaries, by fretful complaints of poverty, or clamorous whinings for meat and clothes :", "50": "-the little patrimony which his foster-father left him, he never diminished, and probably never increased.", "51": "It seems to have equalled all his wants, and, as far as appears, all his wishes.", "52": "Once only he regrets the narrowness of his fortune ;", "53": "but the occasion does him honour ;", "54": "it is solely because he cannot afford a more costly sacrifice to express his pious gratitude for the preservation of his friend:", "55": "yet \" two lambs and a youthful steer \" bespeak the affluence of a philosopher;", "56": "which is not belied by the entertainment provided for his friend Persicus, in that beautiful Satire which is here called the last of his works.", "57": "Further it is useless to seek :", "58": "from pride or modesty, he has left no other notices of himself;", "59": "or they have perished.", "60": "Horace and Persius, his immediate predecessors, are never weary of speaking of themselves.", "61": "The life of the former might be written, from his own materials, with all the mi­ nuteness of a contemporary history:", "62": "and the latter, who attained to little more than a third of Juvenal's age, has left nothing to be desired on the only topics which could interest posterity,-his parent, his preceptor, and his course of studies.", "63": "IT will now be expected from me, perhaps, to say something on the nature and design of Satire ;", "64": "but in truth this has so frequently been done, that it seems, at present, to have as little of novelty as of utility to recommend it.", "65": "Dryden, who had diligently studied the French critics, drew up from their remarks, assisted by a cursory perusal of what Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, and Scaliger had written on the subject, an account of the rise and progress of dramatic and satiric poetry amongst the Romans ;", "66": "which he prefixed to his translation of Juvenal.", "67": "What Dryden knew, he told in a manner that renders every attempt to recount it after him equally hopeless and vain ;", "68": "but his acquaintance with works of literature was not very extensive, while his reliance on his own powers sometimes betrayed him into inaccuracies, to which the influence of his name gives a dangerous importance.\"", "69": "The comparison of Horace with Juvenal and Persius,\" which makes a principal part of his Essay, is not formed with much niceness of discrimination, or accuracy of judgment.", "70": "To speak my mind, I do not think that he clearly perceived or fully understood the characters of the first two :", "71": "-of Persius indeed he had an intimate knowledge ;", "72": "for, though he certain­ ly deemed too humbly of his poetry, he yet speaks of his beau­ ties and defects in a manner which evinces a more than com­ mon acquaintance with both.", "73": "What Dryden left imperfect has been filled up in a great measure by Dusaulx, in the preliminary discourse to his trans­ lation of Juvenal, and by Ruperti, in his critical Essay \" De diversa Satirarum Lucil.", "74": "Herat.", "75": "Pers. et Juvenalis indole.", "76": "\"With the assistance of the former of these I shall endeavour to give a more extended view of the characteristic excellencies and defects of the rival Satirists than has yet appeared in our language;", "77": "little solicitous for the praise of originality, if I may be allowed to aspire to that of candour and truth.", "78": "Pre­ viously to this, however, it will be necessary to say something on the supposed origin of Satire:", "79": "and, as this is a very beaten subject, I shall discuss it as briefly as possible.", "80": "It is probable that the first metrical compositions of the Ro­ mans, like those of every other people, were pious effusions for favours received or expected from the gods :", "81": "of these, the earliest, according to Varro, were the hymns to Mars, which, though used by the Salii in the Augustan age, were no longer intelligible.,", "82": "To these succeeded the Fescennine verses, which were sung, or rather recited, after the vintage and harvest, and appear to have been little more than rude praises of the tutelar'divinities of the country, intermixed with clownish jeers and sarcasms, extemporally poured out by the rustics in some kind of measure, and indifferently directed at the audi­ ence, or at one another.", "83": "These, by degrees, assumed the form of a dialogue;", "84": "of which, as nature is every where the same, and the progress of refinement but little varied, some resem­ blance may perhaps be found in the grosser eclogues of Theo­ critus.", "85": "Thus improved, (if the word may be allowed of such bar­ barous amusements,) they formed, for near three centuries, the delight of that nation :", "86": "popular favour, however, had a dan­ gerous effect on the performers, whose licentiousness dege­ nerated at length into such wild invective, that it was found necessary to restrain it by a positive law:", "87": "\" Si qui populo occentassit, carmenve condisit, quod infamiam faxit ftagitium­ ve alteri, fuste ferito.\"", "88": "From this time we hear no further complaints of the Fescennine verses, which continued to charm the Romans ;", "89": "until, about a century afterwards, and during the ravages of a dreadful pestilence, the senate, as the histo­ rians say, in order to propitiate the gods, called a troop of players from Tuscany, to assist at the celebration of their ancient festivals.", "90": "This was a wise and a salutary measure :", "91": "the plague had spread dejection through the city, which was thus rendered more obnoxious to its fury ;", "92": "and it therefore be­ came necessary, by novel and extraordinary amusements, to divert the attention of the people from the melancholy objects around them.", "93": "As the Romans were unacquainted with the language of Tuscany, the players, Livy tells us, omitted the modulation and the words, and confined themselves solely to gestures, which were accompanied by the flute.", "94": "This imperfect exhi­ bition, however, was so superior to their own, that the Romans eagerly strove to attain the art;", "95": "and, as soon as they could imitate what they admired, graced their rustic measures with music and dancing.", "96": "By degrees they dropped the Fescennine verses for something of a more regular kind, which now took the name of SATIRE.", "97": "1", "98": "These Satires (for as yet they had but little claim to the title of dramas) continued, without much alteration, to the year 514, when Livius Andronicus, a Greek by birth, and a freed­ man of L. Salinator, who was undoubtedly acquainted with the old comedy of his country, produced a regular play.", "99": "That it pleased cannot be doubted, for it surpassed the Satires, even in their improved state ;", "100": "and, indeed, banished them for some time from the scene.", "101": "They had, however, taken too strong a hold of the affections of the people to be easily forgotten, and it was therefore found necessary to reproduce and join them to the plays of Andronicus, (the superiority of which could not be contested,) under the name of Exodia or After-pieces.", "102": "These partook, in a certain degree, of the general amelioration of the stage ;", "103": "something like a story was now introduced into them, which, though frequently indecent and always extrava­ gant, created a greater degree of interest than the reciprocation of gross humour and scurrility in unconnected dialogues.", "104": "Whether any of the old people still regretted this sophisti­ cation of their early amusements, it is not easy to say ;", "105": "but Ennius, who came to Rome about twenty years after this period, and who was more than half a Grecian, conceived that he should perform an acceptable service by reviving the ancient Satires.", "106": "1", "107": "He did not pretend to restore them to the stage, for which indeed the new pieces were infinitely better calcu­ lated, but endeavoured to adapt them to the closet, by refining their grossness and softening their asperity.", "108": "Success justified the attempt.", "109": "Satire, thus freed from action, and formed into a poem, became a favourite pursuit, and was cultivated by several writers of eminence.", "110": "In imitation of his model, Ennius confined himself to no particular species of verse, nor indeed of language, for he mingled Greek expressions with his Latin at pleasure.", "111": "It is solely with a reference to this new attempt that Horace and Quintilian are to be understood, when they claim for the Romans the invention 2 of this kind of poetry ;", "112": "and certainly they had opportunities of judging which we have not, for little of Ennius, and nothing of the old Satire, remains.", "113": "It is not necessary to pursue the history of Satire further in this place, or to speak of another species of it, the Varro­ nian, or, as Varro himself called it, the Menippean, which branched out from the former, and was a medley of prose and verse:", "114": "it will be a more pleasing, as well as a more useful employ, to enter a little into what Dryden, I know not for what reason, calls the most difficult part of his undertaking­ \" a comparative view of the Satirists not certainly with the design of depressing one at the expense of another, (for though I have translated Juvenal, I have no quarrel with Horace and Persius,) but for the purpose of pointing out the characteristic excellencies and defects of them all.", "115": "To do this the more effectually, it will be previously necessary to take a cursory view of the times in which their respective works were pro­ duced.", "116": "LUCILIUS, to whom Horace, forgetting what he had said in another place, attributes the invention of Satire, flourished in the interval between the siege of Carthage and the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutons, by Marius.", "117": "He lived therefore in an age in which the struggle between the old and new manners, though daily becoming more equal, or rather inclining to the worse side, was still far from being decided.", "118": "The freedom of speaking and writing was yet unchecked by fear, or by any law more precise than that which, as has been already men­ tioned, was introduced to restrain the coarse ebullitions of rustic malignity.", "119": "Add to this, that Lucilius was of a most respectable family, (he was great-uncle to Pompey,) and lived in habits of intimacy with the chiefs of the republic, with Laelius, Scipio, and others, who were well able to protect him from the Lupi and Mutii of the day, had they attempted, which they probably did not, to silence or molest him.", "120": "Hence that boldness of satirizing the vicious by name, which startled Horace, and on which Juvenal and Persius delight to felici­ tate him.", "121": "Too little remains of Lucilius, to enable us to judge of his manner:", "122": "his style seems, however, to bear fewer marks of delicacy than of strength, and his strictures appear harsh and violent.", "123": "With all this, he must have been an extraordinary man ;", "124": "since Horace, who is evidently hurt by his reputation, can say nothing worse of his compositions than that they are careless and hasty, and that if he had lived at a more refined period, he would have partaken of the general amelioration.", "125": "I do not remember to have heard it observed, but I suspect that there was something of political spleen in the excessive popu­ larity of Lucilius under Augustus, and something of courtly complacency in the attempt of Horace to counteract it.", "126": "Au­ gustus enlarged the law of the twelve tables respecting libels ;", "127": "and the people, who found themselves thus abridged of the liberty of satirizing the great by name, might not improbably seek to avenge themselves, by an overstrained attachment to the works of a man who, living, as they would insinuate, in better times, practised without fear, what he enjoyed without restraint.", "128": "The space between Horace and his predecessor, was a dreadful interval \" filled up with horror all, and big with death.\"", "129":

though there is quite enough remaining to warrant us in unhesitatingly ascribing the authorship to Juvenal, there is too little left to enable us to form even a probable conjecture as to the date of

Juvenal, as usually given, is a mere myth, to which one cannot even apply, as in many legendary biographies, the epithet of poetical.", "638": "THIS Satire seems, from several incidental circumstances, to have been produced subsequently to most of them;", "639": "and was probably drawn up after the author had determined to collect and publish his works, as a kind of Introduction.",

"652": "in these, especially the first, foreigners have a manifest superiority over the natives, and con­ sequently engross all favour-that the poor are universally exposed to scorn and insult-that the general habits of extravagance render it diffi­ cult for them to subsist-that the want of a well-regulated police subjects them to numberless miseries and inconveniences, aggravated by the crowded state of the capital, from all which a country life is happily free on the tranquillity and security of which he dilates with great beauty.", "653": "In this Satire Juvenal indulges his honest spleen against Crispinus, already noticed, and Domitian, the constant object of his scorn and ab­ horrence.", "654": "The introduction of the tyrant is excellent;", "655": "the mock solem­ nity with which the anecdote of the Turbot is introduced, the procession of the affrighted counsellors to the palace, and the ridiculous debate which terminates in as ridiculous a decision, show a masterly hand.",

takes occasion to give a spirit­ ed detail of the insults and mortifications to which the poor were subjected by the rich, at those entertainments to which, on account of the political connexion subsisting between patrons and clients, it was sometimes thought necessary to invite them.", "658": "The whole of this Satire, not only the longest, but the most complete of the author's works, is directed against the female sex.", "659": "It may be dis­ tributed under the following heads :", "660": "—Lust variously modified, imperious­ ness of disposition, fickleness, gallantry, attachment to improper pursuits, litigiousness, drunkenness, unnatural passions, fondness for singers, dancers, &c.;", "661": "gossiping, cruelty, ill manners;", "662": "outrageous pretensions to criticism,

different head with such satirical, humorous, and senti­ mental remarks as naturally flow from the subject.", "670": "Juvenal demonstrates, in this Satire, that distinction is merely per­ sonal ;", "671": "that though we may derive rank and titles from our ancestors, yet if we degenerate from the virtues by which they obtained them, we cannot be considered truly noble.", "672": "This is the main object of the Satire;", "673": "which, however, branches out into many collateral topics-the profligacy of the young nobility ;", "674": "the miserable state of the provinces, which they plundered and harassed without mercy;", "675": "the contrast between the state of debasement to which the descendants of the best families had sunk, and the opposite virtues to be found in persons of the lowest station and humblest descent.", "676": "The Satire consists of a dialogue between the poet and one Nævolus, a dependent of some wealthy debauchee, who, after making him subser­ vient to his unnatural passions, in return starved, insulted, hated, and discarded him.", "677": "The whole object seems to be, to inculcate the grand moral lesson, that, under any circumstances, a life of sin is a life of slavery.", "678": "The subject of this inimitable Satire is the vanity of human wishes.", "679": "From the principal events of the lives of the most illustrious characters of all ages, the poet shows how little happiness is promoted by the attain­ ment of what our indistinct and limited views represent as the greatest of earthly blessings.", "680": "Of these he instances wealth, power, eloquence, military glory, longevity, and personal accomplishments;", "681": "all of which, he shows, have proved dangerous or destructive to their respective pos­ sessors.", "682": "Hence he argues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations of Heaven ;", "683": "and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he points out with great force and beauty the objects for which a rational being may presume to approach the Almighty.", "684": "Under the form of an invitation to his friend Persicus, Juvenal takes occasion to enunciate many admirable maxims for the due regulation of life.", "685": "After ridiculing the miserable state to which a profligate patrician had reduced himself by his extravagance, he introduces the picture of his own domestic economy, which he follows by a pleasing view of the sim­ plicity of ancient manners, artfully contrasted with the extravagance and luxury of the current times.", "686": "After describing with great beauty the en­ tertainment he proposes to give his friend, he concludes with an earnest recommendation to him to enjoy the present with content, and await the future with calmness and moderation.", "687": "Catullus, a valued friend of the poet, had narrowly escaped shipwreck.", "688": "In a letter of rejoicing to their common friend, Corvinus, Juvenal de­ scribes the danger that his friend had incurred, and his own hearty and disinterested delight at his preservation, contrasting his own sacrifices of thanksgiving at the event, with those offered by the designing legacy- hunters, by which the rich and childless were attempted to be insnared.", "689": "Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidential per­ son, who, when he came to re-demand it, forswore the deposit.", "690": "The in­ dig'nation and fury expressed by Calvinus at this breach of trust, reached the ears of his friend Juvenal, who endeavours to soothe and comfort him under his loss.", "691": "The different topics of consolation follow one another naturally and forcibly, and the horrors of a troubled conscience were per­ haps never depicted with such impressive solemnity as in this Satire.", "692": "The whole of this Satire is directed to the one great end of self-im­ provement.", "693": "By showing the dreadful facility with which children copy the vices of their parents, the poet points out the necessity as well as the sacred duty of giving them examples of domestic purity and virtue.", "694": "After briefly enumerating the several vices, gluttony, cruelty, debauchery, &c., which youth imperceptibly imbibe from their seniors, he enters more at large into that of avarice;", "695": "of which he shows the fatal and inevitable consequences.", "696": "Nothing can surpass the exquisiteness of this division of the Satire, in which he traces the progress of that passion in the youthful mind from the paltry tricks of saving a broken meal to the daring violation of every principle, human and divine.", "697": "Having placed the absurdity as well as the danger of immoderate desires in every point of view, he con­ cludes with a solemn admonition to rest satisfied with those comforts and conveniences which nature and wisdom require, and which a decent competence is easily calculated to supply.", "698": "After enumerating with great humour the animal and vegetable gods of the Egyptians, the author directs his powerful ridicule at their sottish and ferocious bigotry;", "699": "of which he gives an atrocious and loathsome example.", "700": "The conclusion of the Satire, which is a just and beautiful description of the origin of civil society, (infinitely superior to any thing that Lucretius or Horace has delivered on the subject,) founded not on natural instinct, but on principles of mutual benevolence implanted by God in the breast of man, and of man alone, does honour to the genius, good sense, and enlightened morality of the author.", "701": "Under a pretence of pointing out to his friend Gallus the advantages of a military life, Juvenal attacks with considerable spirit the exclusive privileges which the army had acquired or usurped, to the manifest injury of the civil part of the community.", "702": "MUST I always be a hearer only ?", "703": "Shall I never retaliate,1 though plagued so often with the Theseid of Codrus,2 hoarse with reciting it?", "704": "Shall one man, then,

vom himmlischen Feuer des Blitzes behaupten sich ließe, Daß es, von fein'rer Natur, aus kleinern Figuren bestehe, Deßhalb auch durch Oeffnungen dringe, durch welche das Feuer Nimmer zu dringen vermag, das aus Holz und Fackeln entstehet.", "740": "Dann auch dringet das Licht durch Horn, doch weiset das letztre Wasser zurück.", "741": "Weßhalb? weil kleiner die Körper des Lichtstoffs Sind, als die Stoffs aus denen das lautere Wasser bestehet.", "742": "Schnell auch fließet der Wein durch's Seihegefäß, wie wir sehen, Während dagegen das Oel nur langsam sickert in Tropfen, Sei's vielleicht, weil größer die Stoffe von diesem an sich schon, Oder auch fester zusammengehakt und enger verschränkt sind.", "743": "Und so kommt's, daß die einzelnen Theilchen des Stoffes so schnell nicht, Auseinander gezogen, sich loszutrennen vermögen, Um durch jedes der Löcher des Seihegefäßes zu stießen.", "744": "Weiter kommt noch hinzu, daß der Saft von Milch und von Honig Süß sich im Mund auslöst und Ergötzen der Zunge bereitet, Während dagegen das strenge Centaurium, wie auch der bittre Wermuth durch den Geschmack zur Fratze verziehen das Antlitz:", "745": "So, daß leicht du begreifst, es besteh' aus glatten und runden Urstofftheilchen, was lieblich die Sinne vermag zu berühren;", "746": "Dem entgegengesetzt, was als streng und bitter sich kund gibt, Das sei enger verbunden durch hakenförmige Körper:", "747": "Darum pflegt auch dieses die Gänge der Sinne zu reizen Und, in den Körper gelangt, mit Gewalt hindurch sich zu reißen.", "748": "Endlich noch, Alles, was wohl, was übel bekommet den Sinnen, Ist mit sich selbst uneins durch widersprechende Formen.", "749": "Sei nicht etwa des Wahns, es bestehe der knarrenden Säge Widrigtönend Geräusch aus Stoffen, die eben so glatt sind, Wie das melodische Lied, das der Meister der Töne den Saiten Mit dem belebenden Finger entlockt und gestaltet zum Kunstwerk.", "750": "Stoffe von völlig vershciedener Form, das glaube mir, dringen Ein in die Nase des Menschen von faulenden, gährenden Aesern, Ms wo frisch auf der Bühne cilicischer Crocus verduftet Und der Altar aufdampft pamphäische Opfergerüche.", "751": "Gleichfalls glaube du nicht, es bestehn aus ähnlichen Stoffen Jene gefälligen Farben, an denen das Auge sich weidet, Wie durchstechende, die ihm gewaltsam Thränen entlocken, Oder die trüb und schmutzig und häßlich erscheinen dem Blicke;", "752": "Denn kein Ding, das schmeichelt dem Aug' und den Sinnen behaget, Ist ja von Uranfang ohn' einige Glätte geschaffen, Während im Gegentheil, was rauh und I^den Sinnen) beschwerlich, In der Materie schon als der Feinheit mangelnd sich kund gibt.", "753": "Aber es gibt auch stoffliche Körper, die weder für glatt man Kann ansehen mit Recht, noch für krumm mit gebogenen Spitzen;", "754": "Vielmehr zeigen sich Eckchen daran, die ein Weniges vorstehn, Mehr für den Kitzel der Sinne gemacht, als Schmerz zu bereiten:", "755": "Hierher rechnen wir Alantsast und die Sahne des Weines.Endlich noch zeigt das Gefühl uns an, daß brennendes Feuer Und der gefrorene Reif, auf verschiedene Weise gezahnet, Jenes in anderer Art, als dieses, die Sinne verletze.Denn das Gefühl, das Gefühl, beim heiligen Namen der Götter!", "756": "Ist Empfindung des Körpers:", "757": "es sei, daß äußre Berührung Eindringt, oder uns Etwas verletzt, das im Innern erzeugt wird, Oder ein süßer Erguß uns ergötzt in den Werken der Liebe, Oder auch, wenn sich die Stoffe begegnen, ein Streit in dem Körper Selbst entsteht und, erregt, sie den Sinn in einander verwirren:", "758": "Wie dich, wenn zufällig an einem der Theile des Körpers Du mit der Hand dich schlägst, die Erfahrung darüber belehret.", "759": "Folget daraus, daß die Stoffe von sehr abweichender Form sind, Die so verschiedene Gefühle zu Tage zu fördern vermögen.", "760": "Endlich auch muß nothwendig, was hart und dicht uns erscheinet, Alles zumal durch fester zusammengehakete, gleichsam Aestig vershcränkte Stoffe sich eng mit einander verknüpfen.", "761": "In der Gattung behauptet der Demant unter den andern Allen den vordersten Rang, nicht scheut er gewaltsame Schläge.", "762": "Ferner das Kieselgeschlecht und die trotzende Härte des Eisens, Wie auch das Erz, das tönt beim Anprall gegen Verschlösse.", "763": "Doch muß mehr aus glatten und rundlichen Stoffen erzeugt sein, Was, von feuchter Natur, aus flüssigen Körpern bestehet.", "764": "Läuft doch der Same des Mohns so leicht fast hin wie das Wasser, Weil die gerundeten Theilchen, von Nichts aneinander gehalten, Vorwärts laufen und leicht hinziehn in sich neigender Fläche.", "765": "Alles sodann, was in einem Moment sich zerstreuen du siehest, Als da Nebel und Flammen und Rauch sind;", "766": "wenn auch die Stoffe Nicht durchgängig aus Glattem und Rundem zusammengesetzt sind, Dürfen sie doch in einander verschränkt nicht sein, noch verwickelt:", "767": "Könnten sie sonst durchdringen den Stein und zerstechen den Kör­ per, Während das Eine sich nicht an das Andre hänget, wie solches Wir an den Kletten erblicken?", "768": "so daß gar leichtlich dir klar wird, Daß sie aus spitzigen Stoffen bestehn und nicht aus verschränkten.Daß auch Dinge du siehst, die bitter, doch flüssiger Art sind, Gleichwie die Nässe des Meers, darf nicht dich im Mindesten wun­ dern;", "769": "Denn was flüssig, entsteht aus glatten und rundlichen Stoffen;", "770": "Doch mit den glatten und runden gemischt sind schmerzliche Theilchen:", "771": "Gleichwohl ist nicht nöthig, daß selbe zusammengehakt sind;", "772": "Kugelig müssen sie sein, wenn gleich entbehrend der Glätte, Daß beim Vorwärtsrollen zugleich sie die Sinne verletzen.", "773": "Deutlicher noch zu beweisen, daß Rauhes und Glattes gemischt sei In den Stoffen, woraus Neptunus' Körper bestehet, Darf man ja nur sie scheiden und jeglichen einzeln betrachten, Ebendasselbige Naß, oftmals durchsickernd den Boden, Wird in der Grube, nach welcher es abfließt, süß und gemildert:", "774": "Setzt es ja doch an der oberen Fläche das widrige Salz ab, Das, weil rauh von Natur, auch leicht an dm Boden sich anhängtDa nun dieß ich gezeigt, reiht Folgendes passend daran sich, Das gleichfalls den Beweis aus jenem entlehnet:", "775": "daß nämlich Alle Figuren des Stoffs in bestimmtem Maße nur wechseln.", "776": "Wenn das wirklich sich nicht so verhielte, so wären gewisse Körper des Stoffs nothwendig von nicht zu bemessendem Umfang;", "777": "Aber dieweil ihr Körper zugleich auch wiederum klein ist, Können sie ihre Figur doch nicht so bedeutend verändern.", "778": "Setze den Fall, es besteh' aus den winzigsten Theilen der erste Körper, und laß ihn um drei, auch mehrere noch, sich vergrößern;", "779": "Nimm dann sämmtliche Theile defselbigen Körpers und weise Dem, was oben, zu unterst, was rechts, zur Linken den Platz an:", "780": "Hast du auf jegliche Weise versucht nun, was für Figuren", "781": "Aus den Versetzungen allen des einen Körpers sich bilden, Und willst diese Figuren du stets noch weiter verändern, Mußt fortwährend du Theile von anderer Art noch hinzuthun.", "782": "Und so wäre das Werk der Versetzung immer dasselbe, Wenn auf's Reue dir stets die Figuren beliebte zu ändern.", "783": "Hieraus folget:", "784": "so oft auf's Neue sich bildet die Masse, Daß sie vergrößern sich muß;", "785": "drum sei nicht länger des Wahnes, Daß die Figuren des Stoffs unbegränzt von einander entfernt stehn, Denn da müßte man manche von ganz ungeheuerer Größe Sich vorstellen, wofür, wie schon ich gezeigt, der Beweis fehlt.Nunmehr lägen dir schon die barbarischen Feiergewande Meliböischer Purpur, getaucht in thessalischer Schnecken Blut, die mit lachendem Reize der Pfauen bemaleten, goldnen Schleier der Frauen, besiegt von neueren Farben der Dinge.", "786": "Unwerth würden die Düfte der Myrrhe, die Süße des Honigs;", "787": "Schwanengesang, die phöböischen Lieder, dem Klänge der Saiten Künstlich gesellt, auch diese verstummten aus ähnlichem Grunde, Denn ein Neueres stets, ein Besseres, käme zum Vorschein.Ebenso könnt' auch Alles zurück sich wenden zu schlimmern Theilen, gerad wie zu bessern, wovon wir eben gesprochen, Könnt' Etwas für das Auge, das Ohr, den Geruch, den Geschmacks­ sinn Widriger, als vorher, durch neue Berändrungen werden.", "788": "Aber da dieß nicht ist, vielmehr haarscharf für die Dinge Beidseits Gränzen bestehen, das Ganze zusammenzuhalten,

beiderlei Seite mit doppelter Schneide gezeichnet, V Hier mit Flammen und dort mit starrendem Froste besetzet.Laß mich mit dem Lehrsatze den folgenden auch noch verbinden, Der den Beweis von jenem

wenigen, lieblich i Klingenden Versen mich dir darthun, daß die Körper des Stoffes Seit undenklichen Zeiten erhalten die sämmtlichen Dinge, Weil ununterbrochen im Fortschuß sie sich befinden.Seltener

die Dinge, die wir bei nächtlichem Dunkel berühren, Nehmen wir wahr, obgleich nicht Farbe daran wir erkennen.Daß dieß so sich verhalte, beweis' ich jetzo mit Gründen.", "857": "Jegliche Farbe verwandelt sich leichtlich in jegliche Farbe;", "858": "Dieses jedoch kann nie bei den Urelementen der Fall sein, Sondern es muß stets Etwas bestehn, das nie sich verändert, Daß nicht Alles zu Nichts

Stoffe der Dinge zu tünchen, Daß nicht Alles zuletzt in's Nichts umkehre von Grund aus.Mangelt den Urelementen nun gleich auch ihrer Natur nach Farbe, so zeigen sie doch sich in mannigfaltigen Formen, Wechselnde Farben daraus von verschiedenen Arten zu schaffen.", "861": "Dann auch ist von Bedeutung die Mischung und Lage der Stoffe, Wie sie sich unter einander und wieder zu andern verhalten, Welche Bewegung sie sich mittheilen und wieder empfangen, So daß leichtlich daraus der Beweis herleiten sich lässet, Weßhalb das, was schwarz von Farbe noch eben gewesen, Sich urplötzlich in Weiße des Marmors könne verändern, Wie, von des Sturmes Gewalt in die Höhe getrieben, die Meerfluth Sich umwandelt in Wogen von Heller und glänzender Weiße.", "862": "Alsdann könnte man sagen, daß das, was öfter wir schwarz sehn, Wenn es die Stoffe durchmischt und anders gestaltet die Ordnung, Also, daß sich die einen verminderten, anderen Zuwachs Würde zu Theil, sich sofort als weiß und glänzend

einfarbig zu zeigen vermöchte.Ein noch weiterer Grund, der etwa verleiten uns könnte, Zuzuerkennen die Farbe den uranfänglichen Stoffen, Hebet sich auf, da weder aus weißen entstehet das Weiße, Noch aus schwarzen was Schwärze man nennt, vielmehr aus verschiednen, Liegt viel näher da doch ftie Vermuthung^ uns, daß das Weiße Aus Farblosem entsteh', als sich aus Schwarzem erzeuge, Oder aus jeglicher Farbe, mit der fortwährend es streitet.Ferner, da ohne das Licht nicht können bestehen die Farben, Noch an das Licht vortreten die uranfänglichen Stoffe, Folget daraus, daß diese der Tünche der Farben ermangeln.", "870": "Wie doch einte sich Farbe mit lichtentbehrendem Dunkel, Sie, die selber im Licht sich verändert und so oder anders, Ob senkrecht, ob schräge der Strahl sie getroffen,

Schweife des Pfouen die vollere Sonne Spiegelt, verändert auch dieser auf ähnliche Weise die Farben.", "875": "Da nun dieß von des Lichts selbsteigenem Wurfe bewirkt wird, Ist es auch klar, daß ohne das Licht nie möglich es wäre.", "876": "Ferner noch:", "877": "da die Pupille von anderen Stößen gereizt wird, Wann sie das Weiße, von andern hinwiederum, wann sie das Schwarze Fühlet, und so stets

nimmer der Farbe die Stoffe bedürfen, Sondern verschiedener Formen, vershciedne Gefühle zu äußern.", "880": "Wäre bestimmten Figuren sodann nicht eigen gewisser Farbe Natur, und könnte daher auch jegliche Bildung Uranfänglicher Stoffe mit jeglicher Farbe bestehen:", "881": "Wie doch kommt'S, daß Dinge, die doch aus solchen bestehen, Nicht auf ähnliche Weis' in jeglicher Farbe sich zeigen?",

kehren.Endlich, indem du gestehst, nicht gehe von jeglichem Körper Ton aus oder Geruch, so ergibt aus diesem zugleich sich, Daß Ton oder Geruch nicht jeglichem Körper du zutheilst.", "888": "Also begreift sich's auch, daß, weil nicht Alles erkennbar Unseren Augen sich zeigt, doch Körper es gibt, die der Farbe Gleichergestalt ermangeln, wie andre des Tons und Geruches;", "889": "Und es erkennt nicht minder der forschende Geist sie, denn jene, Die bei anderen Dingen auch anderer Zeichen entbehren.", "890": "Aber, damit nicht etwa du meinst, nur einzig die Farbe Mangle den Urstoff-Körpern:",

erreichet der Tod beim Streben nach Säulen und Nachruhm;", "1085": "Oft ergreifet sogar aus Furcht vor dem Tode die Menschen Abscheu siänger^ zu leben, das Licht jnoch fernerZ zu schauen, Daß sie selber den Tod mit traurigem Herzen sich anthun, Uneingedenk, ihr Kummer entquelle der nämlichen Furcht blos, Diese verletze die Scham, sie breche die Bande der Freundschaft, Und zerstöre zumal das Bewußtsein heiliger Pflichten.", "1086": "Gaben doch oft schon Menschen ihr Vaterland und geliebte Eltern dahin, um nur zu entgehen des Acheron Abgrund.", "1087": "Denn, wie Kinder im Finstern vor Allem sich fürchten und zittern, Also fürchten auch wir manchmal beim Lichte des Tages Uns vor Dingen, die mehr nicht fürchten man sollte, denn das, was Kinder im Finstern erschreckt, weil schon Einbildung sie ängstet.", "1088": "Dieses Erbangen des Geists, dieß Dunkel, es muß sich zerstreuen, Nicht vor den Strahlen der Sonne, den leuchtenden Pfeilen des Tages, Lediglich vor der Natur Anschaun und vor der Erkenntniß.", "1089": "Allerst sag' ich:", "1090": "der Geist, den öfter Verstand wir auch nennen, Er, der den Rath sür's Leben ertheilt und das Steuer regieret, Sei vom Menschen ein Theil, wie Hand und Fuß und die Augen Eben auch Theile nur sind vom ganzen belebeten Wesen.Wohl war unter den Weisen ein ziemliches Häufchen der Ansicht, Daß an besondere Theile der Geist nicht seie gebunden, Sondern er sei vielmehr die lebendige Stimmung des Körpers, Harmonie von den Griechen genannt, die Leben und Fühlen In uns erzeugt, da der Geist nicht wohn' in den einzelnen Theilen.", "1091": "Und wie man oftmals sagt, es befinde gesund sich der Körper, Während ja doch an keinem der Theile für sich er gesund ist:", "1092": "Ebenso geben dem Geist sie den Sitz in keinem der Theile.", "1093": "Hier nun scheinen sie mir vom Wahren sich weit zu verirren.", "1094": "Oftmals zeiget sich ja Krankheit am sichtbaren Körper, Während wir anderen Theils im Innern heiter und froh sind:", "1095": "Wiederum ist es der Fall, daß anderer Seits sich am Geiste Elend fühlt, wer dem Körper nach durchaus heiter und wohl ist:", "1096": "Nicht auf andere Weis', als, während den Kranken der Fuß schmerzt, Sich gleichzeitig das Haupt frei findet von aller Beshcwerde.", "1097": "Weiter auch noch, wenn die Glieder erquickendem Schlummer sich widmen, Hingegossen und ohne Gefühl dalieget der Körper, Ist doch ein Andres in uns, das zur nämlichen Zeit auf vershcleime Art umher wird getrieben und jegliche freudige Regung In sich empfängt, wie auch ungegründete Sorgen des Herzens.Daß du nun auch einsehest, es wohne die Seel' in den Gliedern, Und nicht sei's Harmonie, die pflege den Körper zu halten:", "1098": "Sage vorerst:", "1099": "wie kommt's, daß bei häufigem Körperverluste Doch gar oft noch Leben in unseren Gliedern zurückbleibt?", "1100": "Wiederum aber, sobald nur wenige Stoffe von Wärme Fort sind und aus dem Munde die Luft hinaus ist gehauchet, Geht aus den Adern es plötzlich hinweg und verlässet die Knochen.", "1101": "Hieraus magst du erkennen, es haben nicht sämmtliche Stoffe Gleich Antheil, und stützen auch nicht gleichmäßig das Wohlsein, Sondern es sei'n vorzüglich die Stoffe des Hauchs und der Wärme, Die da sorgen, daß Leben in unseren Gliedern verweile.", "1102": "Demnach ist es die Wärm' und der Lebenshauch in dem Körper, Was im Momente des Tods aus unseren Gliedern davonweicht.", "1103": "Hast nunmehr du gefunden, das Wesen des Geists und der Seele Sei gleichsam vom Menschen ein Theil, so verzieh? auf den Namen Harmonie:", "1104": "von des Helicon Höhn, den melodischen, ward er Niedergebracht, vielleicht auch sonstwo geholt und der Sache Beigelegt, die noch immer des eigenen Namens entbehrte.", "1105": "Laß es bewenden, es sei, wie's will, und das Weitre vernimm nun.Jetzo behaupt' ich, die Seel' und der Geist sei'n untereinander Innig verbunden und machen zusammen nur eine Natur aus;", "1106": "Aber das Haupt gleichsam ist die Denkkrast, welche den ganzen Körper beherrscht, ist das, was Geist und Verstand wir benennen, Und fest hat sie den Sitz in der Mitte der Brust sich gegründet.", "1107": "Hier tobt Schrecken und Furcht, und an eben dem Ort und zunächst ihm Streichelt die Lust uns sanft:", "1108": "drum wohnet der Geist, der Verstand, hier.", "1109": "Diesem gehorcht, was sonst noch zur Seele gehört und im ganzen Körper zerstreut sich befindet, bewegt nach dem Winke des Geists sich;", "1110": "Dieser allein hat Rath in sich selbst, hat eigene Freuden, Ohne daß irgend ein Ding je Seel' und Körper beeinflußt.", "1111": "Und gleichwie wir, wenn Haupt und Auge geschädiget werden, Schmerz empfinden, und doch nicht Qual ausstehen am ganzen Leib:", "1112": "so leidet der Geist auch selbst bisweilen, genießet Ebenso Freuden, dieweil, was weiter zur Seele gehöret, Nicht im mindesten Grad in Gelenken und Gliedern erregt wird.", "1113": "Wird hingegen der Geist durch heftigen Schrecken erschüttert, Sehn wir die Seele zugleich auch leiden durch sämmtliche Glieder, Sehen, wie Schweiß ausbricht, wie Blässe sich über den ganzen Körper verbreitet, die Zunge versagt und die Stimme dahinstirbt, Dunkel das Aug' umziehet, das Knie einsinket, das Ohr saust.Ferner auch sehn wir öfter, von Schrecken des Geistes ergriffen, Menschen zur Erd' hinstürzen, woraus leicht Jeder den Schluß zieht, Seel' und Geist sei'n innig verbunden, und jene, vom Geiste Mächtig getroffene, stößt auf den Körper und wirft ihn darnieder.Eben der Grund zeigt auch, daß das Wesen des Geists und der Seele Körperlich sei;", "1114": "wie käm' es denn sonst, daß die Glieder sie vorwärts Treiben wir sähen, den Körper vom Schlaf ausraffen, die Züge Aeudern und ganz nach Willen den Menschen regieren und lenken?", "1115": "Läßt doch ohne Berührung sich Nichts von alle dem denken, Noch die Berührung ohne den Körper.", "1116": "Bekennt man nun noch nicht, Körperlich seie das Leben des Geistes sowohl, als der Seele?", "1117": "Außerdem nimmst du noch wahr, daß Geist und Körper gemeinsam Wirken, der Geist gleichfalls die Empfindungen theilt mit dem Körper.", "1118": "Dringet ein starrender Pfeil in's Innere so, daß er Knochen Trennt und Nerven und doch nicht ernstlich das Leben bedrohet, Ist doch Ermattung die Folg' und sanftes Verlangen zu fallen, Und nach dem Fall stellt sich aufwallender Taumel des Geists ein, Manchmal schwankender Will', empor sich wieder zu richten.", "1119": "Körperlich muß demnach nothwendig das Wesen des Geists sein, Weil, wenn der Körper des Pfeils ihn traf, er Qualen empfindet.Was für ein Körper der Geist indeß und wie er geformt sei, Davon soll mein Gedicht im Folgenden liesern den Nachweis.Erstlich behaupt' ich, er sei gar fein und nur aus den kleinsten Stoffen zusammengesetzt.", "1120": "Daß dieß sich also verhalte, Machst du dir klar, sobald du das Folgende reiflich erwägest.", "1121": "Schnelleres scheint in der That sich Nichts vorstellen zu lassen, Als wozu sich der Geist entschließt, was selbst er beginnet.", "1122": "Schneller somit ist der Geist, als Alles, was sonst noch erregt wird, Dessen Natur wir deutlich mit unseren Augen erkennen.", "1123": "Nun kann aber doch das, was so rastlos stets sich beweget, Lediglich nur aus runden und winzigen Stoffen bestehen, Deren Bewegung schon erfolgt beim leisesten Antrieb.", "1124": "Also bewegt sich das Wasser und wallt beim mindesten Stoße, Weil es aus leicht hinrollenden, winzigen Stoffen bestehet, Während dagegen der Honig von ungleich dicht'rer Natur ist, Träger im Fluß sich zeigt und mühsamer in der Bewegung, Denn weit fester ja hängt aneinander die sämmtliche Masse:", "1125": "Ganz natürlich, dieweil sie aus Stoffen bestehet, die minder Glatt sind, minder subtil an Gestalt und minder gerundet.", "1126": "Ebenso kann Mohnkörner ein leicht sich erhebendes Lüftchen Wegwehn, bis vom Höchsten herunter der Haufe zerrinnet;", "1127": "Aber es setzt Nichts durch, wo Stein' und Garben gestapelt Liegen, woraus sich ergibt, daß Körper, je winziger selbe Und je glatter sie sind, um so leichter bewegen sich lassen, Während im Gegentheil Jedwedes, das schwer in's Gewicht fällt, Und als rauh sich erweist, um so fester dem Boden sich anschmiegt.Nun, da bezüglich des Geistes Natur wir haben gesunden, Wie so beweglich sie ist, so muß nothwendig derselbe Aus ganz winzigen, glatten, gerundeten Stoffen bestehen.", "1128": "Dieses erkundet zu haben, o Trefflicher, wird dir in vielen Dingen von Vortheil sein und ganz willkommen dir heißen.Weiter bethätiget auch noch dieses des Geistes Natur dir, Wie so dünn sein Gewebe, wie winzig der Platz, den er einnimmt, Wäre, wofern er in Eines zusammenballen sich ließe.", "1129": "Nämlich, sobald mit dem Tode der Mensch zur sicheren Ruhe Eingegangen, und Geist und Seele von ihm sich getrennet, Deutet dir dennoch Nichts auf Abgang hin an des ganzen Körpers Gestalt und Gewicht:", "1130": "der Tod läßt Alles bestehen, Einzig der Hauch, der das Leben bedingt, entweicht und die Wärme.Also besteht durchgängig die Seel' aus winzigen Samen, Ist in die Adern verwoben, in's Eingeweid' und die Nerven;", "1131": "Sintemal, wenn auch völlig entwichen sie ist aus dem ganzen Körper, ja doch noch immer des Gliedbau's äußerer Umfang Ganz unbemängelt erscheint und Nichts abgeht am Gewichte.", "1132": "Ebenso ist's, wenn die Blum' entschwindet der Gabe des Bacchus, Oder die lieblichen Düfte der Salb' entfliehn in die Lüfte, Oder der Saft entweicht aus sonst noch anderen Körpern:", "1133": "Nimmer erscheint deßwegen dem Auge die Sach' an sich selber, Als ob gemindert sie wär' und Gewichtabmangel erlitte.", "1134": "Das ist leicht zu verstehn, da die Vielzahl winziger Samen Saft und Geruch in der Dinge gesummtem Körper hervorbringt.", "1135": "Hieraus folgt der unläugbare Satz:", "1136": "es bestehe des Geistes Und der Seele Natur aus den allerwinzigsten Samen, Weil, auch wenn sie entfliehn, sie Nichts am Gewichte vermindern.", "1137": "Doch ist diese Natur als einfach nicht zu betrachten;", "1138": "Denn von den Sterbenden geht ein schwacher, mit Wärme vermischter Hauch aus, aber die Wärme verzieht alsbald in die Lust sich:", "1139": "Keinerlei Wärme besteht, die nicht vermischet mit Lust ist.", "1140": "Dünn ist bekanntlich der Wärme Natur, deßwegen auch müssen Viel'", "1141": "Urstoffe der Luft sich zwischen derselben bewegen.", "1142": "Dreifach haben des Geistes Natur nunmehr wir erfunden, Doch ist dieses noch nicht hinreichend, Gefühl zu erzeugen, Weil die Vernunt fnicht faßt, wie Etwas von diesem Empfindung Zeugenden Trieb zu erschaffen vermag, der Gedanken hervorwälzt.", "1143": "Drum ist nöthig, hiezu zu fügen noch eine gewisse Vierte Natur;", "1144": "indeß entbehrt die jegliches Namens:", "1145": "Nichts so Bewegliches ist, auch nichts so Zartes vorhanden, Nichts, das aus Ursprungsstoffen, so glatt und so winzig, bestünde, Als dieß, welches der Grund der Empfindung ist in den Gliedern.", "1146": "Dieses erregt sich zuerst, da seine Figuren so klein sind;", "1147": "Wärm' und verborgener Hauch empfangen nur weiteren Anstoß, Ferner die Lust, worauf dann Alles geräth in Bewegung.", "1148": "Nun wird erschüttert das Blut, Empfindung dringt in das ganze Innere, theilet zuletzt den Knochen sich mit und dem Marke, Ob's ein süßes Gefühl nun sei, ob schmerzendes Brennen.", "1149": "Uebrigens kann kein Schmerz so leichtweg dringen bis hieher, Auch nicht sonstige Qual, ohn' Alles zu bringen in Ausruhr, So daß selber der Ort dem Leben entgeht und der Seele Theile davon sich machen durch alle Kanäle des Körpers.", "1150": "Aber gemeiniglich hört gleichsam am äußeren Körper Schon die Erschütterung auf:", "1151": "dieß ist's, was das Leben uns rettet.Wie nun diese gemischt mit einander bestehn und mit welchen Eigenschaften begabt, das macht' ich gern dir verständlich, Aber es hindert daran mich die Armuth unserer Sprache:", "1152": "Laß indessen mich kurz, so weit ich's vermag, es berühren.Es durchlaufen somit sich die uranfänglichen Stoffe Mit solch regsamem Trieb, daß keiner sich lässet herausziehn, Eben so wenig die Kraft durch Zwischenraum

diesen zusammen Nur ein einziger Körper, woran Nichts mangelt, sich bildet:", "1155": "Schafft auch Mischung von Wärm' und Lust und verborgenem Hauche Eine Natur, wozu noch jene bewegliche Kraft kommt, Die aus sich selber den andern ertheilt den Beginn der Bewegung, Welcher zuerst im Innern der Trieb entstammt des Gefühles.", "1156": "Denn ganz heimlich versteckt ist die Grundkrast, und es gibt Nichts, Das sich tiefer verborgen in unserem Körper verbindet, Das wir füglich als Seele der ganzen Seele bezeichnen.", "1157": "Gleichwie in unsern Gliedern und allenthalben im Körper Kräfte des Geists und Vermögen der Seele gemischet versteckt sind, Weil sie ja nur aus kleinen und wenigen Stoffen bestehen:", "1158": "So ist in dir die Kraft, die des Namens entbehrt und aus kleinen Stoffen bestehet, versteckt, ist gleichsam die Seele der ganzen Seel' und besitzt vollständig die Herrschaft über den Körper.", "1159": "In ganz ähnlicher Art muß Hauch und Luft auch und Wärme, Unter einander gemischt in den Gliedern, thätig sich zeigen, Eines dem anderen mehr nachstehn, dann wieder sich vorthun, Daß ein einziges Ganzes aus ihnen sich scheine zu bilden, Und nicht jedes besonders, die Wärme, getrennt von der Lust, und Die vom Hauche, vernichte den Sinn, durch Sonderung löse.Wärme befindet sich auch im Geist, wann Zorn ihn erfasset, Wann er in Hitze geräth und Glut aussprüht aus den Augen, Während der frostige Hauch allmeist der Begleiter der Furcht ist, Welche den Körper erschüttert und Schauer erregt in den Gliedern.", "1160": "So auch liegt's in der ruhigen Luft selbsteigenem Wesen, Daß sie den Frieden erzeugt in der Brust und heiteres Aussehn.", "1161": "Aber die Wärm' ist mehr bei denen vorhanden, die heftig Sind genaturt, und deren Gemüth leicht reizbar zum Zorn ist.",

nicht.", "1164": "Aber der kältere Hauch herrscht vor im Sinne des Hirsches, Und erreget in ihm weit schneller die frostigen Lüfte, Durch die Zittern und Beben in sämmtlichen Gliedern entstehet.",

verborgenen Gründe Dir entwickeln, und nicht ausfinden die Menge von Namen Jener Figuren des Stoffs, die diese Verschiedenheit wirken.Das nur glaub' ich hierin mit Bestimmtheit sagen zu können, Daß die von der Natur uns stets anhaftenden Spuren, Die die Vernunft nicht könnte beseitigen, äußerst gering find, Daß Nichts hindert, ein Leben, der Himmlischen würdig, zu führen.", "1176": "Diese Natur

erregten gemeinsamen Antrieb Wird zusammengehauchet der Sinn, entzündet im Innern.Ferner vermag auch der Körper allein niemals sich zu bilden, Oder zu wachsen, noch auch nach dem Tode sich fort zu erhalten.", "1183": "Denn nicht also, wie öfter das Wasser die Wärme verlieret, Die es besitzt, und doch deßhalb nicht selber verzehrt wird, Sondern in seinem Bestand sich erhält:", "1184": "nicht

gewöhnt sich des Körpers und Geistes Wechselberührung so zum wirkenden Leben zusammen, Schon im Leibe der Mutter und noch im Schooße verborgen, Daß Unheil und Ruin nothwendig erfolgt bei der Trennung.", "1187": "Lerne daraus, da gemeinsam das Wohlsein beider bedingt ist, Daß auch ihre Natur nur, wenn sie verbunden, bestehn kann.Uebrigens, wer da behauptet, es gehe dem Körper Gefühl ab, Und daß einzig die Seele, die ganz mit dem Körper gemischt ist, Jener Bewegungen Trägerin sei, die Gefühl wir benennen:", "1188": "Dieser begibt sich in Kampf mit der offenkundigen Wahrheit.", "1189": "Denn wer kann, was des Körpers Gefühl sei, anders beweisen, Als aus der Sache, die selbst uns vorliegt und uns belehret?", "1190": "Doch, wenn entwichen die Seel', ist ganz auch der Körper gefühllos, Denn er verliert, was zu keinerlei Zeit sein eigen gewesen, Vieles verliert er dazu, wann jene vom Alter verjagt wird.", "1191": "Wenn man noch weiter behauptet, es sehen die Augen ein Ding nicht, Sondern es schaue die Seel', als wie durch offene Thüren, Durch sie, läßt dieß schwer sich verstehn, da dagegen ihr Sinn spricht;", "1192": "Denn der ziehet die Bilder heran und drängt sie zum Blick hin:", "1193": "Deßhalb können wir oft hellglänzende Dinge nicht sehen, Weil vom Lichte sgerade^ die Augen uns werden geblendet.", "1194": "Nicht so ist's mit den Thüren:", "1195": "die Thüren, durch welche wir blicken, Werden, indem man sie öffnet, in keinerlei Weise belästigt.", "1196": "Uebrigens, will für Thüren man unsere Augen erklären, Müßte bei fehlenden Augen die Seele, da selber die Pfosten Nicht mehr hinderlich sind, weit mehrere Dinge noch sehen.Keineswegs auch mögest du das zu eigen dir machen, Was die geheiligte Lehre des Manns Democritus ausstellt:", "1197": "Daß die vereinzelten Stoffe des Körpers und Geistes, ein jedes Reben das andre gethan, durch Wechsel die Glieder verbinden.", "1198": "Nämlich die Stoffe des Geists sind um viel winziger noch, als Jene, woraus unser Körper besteht und die inneren Theile;", "1199": "Auch an der Zahl stehn diesen sie nach und sind in den Gliedern Sparsam vertheilt, daß lediglich das sich ließe bestimmen:", "1200": "Daß, wie viele von Theilchen des seelischen Stoffs wir bedürfen, Um sinnzeugende Regung hervor im Körper zu rufen, Eben so viele derselben die ZwishcenrSume besetzen.", "1201": "Denn, wenn Staub bisweilen sich hängt an den Körper, so fühlen Dieses wir nicht, noch auch, wenn Kreide sich setzt auf die Glieder;", "1202": "Weder den Nebel bei Nacht, noch die zarten Gespinnste der Spinne, Welche

Geschmeiß, das über den Körper uns hinläuft.", "1206": "Demnach muß gar Vieles in uns erst rege gemacht sein, Bis die mit unsern Gliedern gemischeten Stoffe der Seele Gleichfalls werden erregt und zur Empfindung gelangen;", "1207": "Bis sie, gestoßen aus mächtigen Räumen, zusammen zu laufen, Sich zu verbinden und wiederum abzuspringen vermögen.", "1208": "Inniger hält auch der Geist die Lebensbande zusammen, Und übt mehr, als die Seele, die Herrschaft über das Leben.", "1209": "Kann doch ohne die Kräfte des Geists kein Theilchen der Seele Nur aus die kürzeste Dauer von Zeit in den Gliedern verweilen, Sondern es folgt als Begleiter ihm rasch, entschwebt in die Lüfte Und läßt, starr vom Froste des Todes, die Glieder zurücke.", "1210": "Aber im Leben verbleibt, wem geistige Kraft noch zurückblieb, Seien verstümmelt ihm auch, ja völlig zerfleischet die Glieder:", "1211": "Selbst als Rumpf, dem die Glieder man abriß, lebet er ohne Seele noch fort und athmet ätherische Hauche des Lebens.", "1212": "Wenn er nicht ganz und gar, obgleich zum beträchtlichen Theile, Seellos ist, dann weilet er noch im Leben und hängt dran;", "1213": "Wie, wenn das Auge zerfleischt, unversehret

verbindungslos sie gelassen, Denn dieß würde nicht ohne Verderben für beide geschehen.", "1215": "Doch, ist ein winziger Theil nur inmitten des Auges zerfressen, Dann geht plötzlich zu Grunde das Licht und es folget das Dunkel, Mag im Uebrigen auch unversehrt und glänzend der Kreis sein.", "1216": "Durch solch Band sind Geist und Seel' auch ständig verbunden.Auf nun, daß du erkennest, es werden zugleich mit den Körpern Geist und Seele geschaffen und sterben auch wieder mit diesen, Will ich, was süßes Bemühn seit lange gesucht und gefunden, Im dein würdigen Lied forthin auseinander dir setzen.", "1217": "Fass' indessen die Namen von beiden in einen zusammen, Daß du, so\"oft ich mich etwa des Namens „Seele\" bediene, Diese für sterblich erklärend, das Nämliche glaubst von dem Geiste, Da sie beide nur Eins und unter sich innig verknüpft sind.So denn hab' ich zum Ersten gezeigt, es bestehe dieß zarte Wesen aus winzigen Körpern und aus weit kleineren Stoffen, Als klarfließendes Wasser und Rauch und Nebel;", "1218": "denn weitaus Stehet es diesen voran an Beweglichkeit, und, erreget Selbst von der leisesten Triebkraft nur, wird schon es beweget ^Schon von den bloßen Gebilden des Rauchs und des Nebels beweget).", "1219": "Gleichfalls, wenn wir, in Schlummer versenkt, von erhabnen Altären Sehen den Dampf aufsteigen und Rauch sich von ihnen erheben, Wo kein Zweifel besteht, daß dieß durch Bilder erzeugt wird.", "1220": "Wenn du somit wahrnimmst, daß allenthalben das Wasser Rinnt aus lecken Gesäßen, das Naß entweicht, in die Lüste Rauch und Nebel zerfliegen, so glaube mir, daß auf dieselbe Weise die Seele verdunste, ja, noch weit schneller vergehe, Rascher sich auch auslös' in die uranfänglichen Stoffe, Wenn aus den Gliedern des Menschen einmal sie hinweg sich ge­ zogen.", "1221": "Denn, wofern sie der Körper, der gleichsam doch ihr Gefäß ist, Nimmer zusammenzuhalten vermag, wenn irgend ein Unfall, Oder den Adern entzogenes Blut ihn geschwächt und zerstört hat:", "1222": "Wie doch wäre die Luft sie zusammenzuhalten im Stande, Die, weil lockrer, hiezu weit weniger taugt, als der Körper?Weiter bemerken wir noch, daß die Seele zugleich mit dem Körper Werde gezeugt, aufwahcse zugleich mit demselben und alt're;", "1223": "Denn, wie das Kind, so lange noch schwach sein Körper und zart ist, Unstät schwankt, so zeiget auch schwach bei ihm noch der Geist sich:", "1224": "Sind nun aber die Kräfte gestärkt durch reiferes Alter, Nimmt auch die Ueberlegung damit und die geistige Kraft zu.", "1225": "Ist von den Stürmen der Zeit in der Folge der Körper zerrüttet, Fallen die Glieder zusammen bei stumpf gewordenen Kräften:", "1226": "Dann auch erlahmet der Geist, es verirrt sich Zung' und Gedanke, Alles zumal nimmt ab und versagt gleichzeitig die Dienste.", "1227": "Dem vollkommen gemäß löst ebenso auch sich der Seele Ganze Natur, wie der Rauch sich hoch in die Lüfte zertheilet, Da wir zugleich mit dem Körper erzeugt sie sehen und wachsen Und, wie bereits ich gelehrt, vom Alter ermüdet zerfallen.", "1228": "Hiezu kommt dann weiter, daß, wie wir schreckliche Krankheit Ausstehn sehen den Körper und Schmerzen erdulden und Mühsal, Gleichergestalt an der Seel' auch Furcht wahrnehmen und Trauer, Draus sich ergibt, daß der Tod auch sie muß treffen, wie jenen.Ja, bei krankendem Körper verliert nicht selten der Geist auch Seinen gehörigen Stand, wird blöd und redet im Irrsinn;", "1229": "Manchmal sinket er auch durch Schlafsucht tief in den Schlummer Und in den ewigen Schlaf, bei isnkenden Augen und Antlitz:", "1230": "Nimmer vernimmt er Stimmen, erkennt auch nimmer die Züge Derer, die, noch einmal in's Leben zurück ihn zu rufen, Ringsum stehen, Gesicht und Wangen mit Thränen benetzend.", "1231": "Deßhalb mußt du gestehen, es sei auflösbar der Geist auch, Sintemal auch sich in ihn eindrängt ansteckende Krankheit:", "1232": "Beide ja sind, Krankheit wie Schmerz, Urheber des Todes, Wie der Verlust so Vieler uns längst hierüber belehrt hat.", "1233": "Endlich nun noch:", "1234": "hat des Weines Gewalt durchdrungen die Herzen Und in den Adern sofort die vertheilete Glut sich verbreitet, Dann folgt Schwere der Glieder, der Gang wird schwankend, die Zunge Weigert die Dienste, die Seel' ist selber betrunken, die Augen Werden getrübt, es erhebt sich Geschrei und Geschluchz' und Gezänke, Und was sonst noch von solchen Erscheinungen Alles sich einstellt.", "1235": "Was ist's Andres, als daß die gewaltige Stärke des Weines Selbst im Körper die Seel' in Verwirrung pfleget zu bringen?", "1236": "Alles jedoch, was sich läßt in Verwirrung bringen und hindern, Zeigt, wenn ein Anlaß noch, der kräftiger wirket, hinzutritt, Daß es zu Grund gehn kann und fernerer Dauer beraubt sein.", "1237": "Plötzlich sogar stürzt Einer, ergriffen von heftiger Krankheit, Nieder vor unseren Augen, als hätte der Blitz ihn getroffen, Schaum tritt über die Lippen, er stöhnt, ihm zittern die Glieder, Sinnlos liegt er, die Nerven gedehnt, fühlt Qualen, gebrochen Athmet er nur und ermüdet ^zuletzt) die geschüttelten Glieder.", "1238": "Gleichwie nun die umher in den Gliedern wüthende Krankheit Störend wirkt auf den Geist, so kochen die schäumenden Wogen Auch auf der salzigen Fluth, von Sturmesgewalten getrieben.", "1239": "Seufzer entPressen sosort sich der Brust, weil Schmerz in den Gliedern Fest sich gesetzt,

da die Kraft des Geists und der Seele In Verwirrung geräth und, wie ich gezeigt, durch dasselbe Gift auseinander gerissen und jede besonders zerstreut wird.", "1241": "Ist nun der Krankheit Grund entfernt, und kehret der scharfe Saft des verdorbenen Körpers zurück zu seinen Gesässen, Dann erhebt, wie im Taumel, der Kranke zuerst sich, und mälig Nimmt die Besinnungskraft er zurück und mit dieser die Seele.", "1242": "Die nun, welche du so durch Krankheit schon in dem Körper Auf elendige Weise zerrissen, geworfen, geplagt siehst;", "1243": "Die könn' ohne den Körper, vermeinst du, frei in den Lüsten, Zu den gewaltigen Stürmen gesellt, sich lebend erhalten?Sehn wir die Seele nun auch, gleichwie den erkranketen Körper, Durch der Arznei Wirkung die Gesundheit wieder erlangen, Zeigt auch dieses uns an, daß sterblich der Seele Natur sei.", "1244": "Theile ja hätte hinzuzufügen, die Lage zu wechseln, Oder, es sei auch Weniges nur, vom Ganzen zu nehmen, Wer den Versuch anstellet, der Seele Natur zu verändern, Oder das Wesen von sonst was Andrem zu werden bemüht ist.", "1245": "Doch läßt weder die Theile versetzen, noch Etwas hinzuthun Ein Unsterbliches, duldet auch nicht den geringesten Abfluß:", "1246": "Denn was Aendrung erleidet, die eigenen Grenzen verlasset, Findet den Tod urplötzlich in dem, was zuvor es gewesen.Also die Seel', — ob krank, ob durch Heilmittel genesend — Zeichen der Sterblichkeit gibt, wie ich gezeiget, sie von sich:", "1247": "So sehr scheint denn wirklich betrügrischen Schlüssen die Wahrheit Sich entgegenzustellen, den Ausweg ihnen zu

Auge.", "1614": "Diese, von denen ich rede, die Bilder der Dinge, verbreiten Ringsum sich und werfen sich hin nach jeglicher Seite;", "1615": "Aber dieweil wir allein mit den Augen zu sehen im Stand sind, Kommt's, daß von da nur, wohin das Gesicht wir wenden, die Dinge Alle zumal nach Gestalt und Färb' auf selbiges treffen.", "1616": "Ebenso wirket das Bild, daß den Abstand jegliches Dings wir Sehen und solches »iach diesem^ zu unterscheiden vermögen.", "1617": "Nämlich, sobald entsendet das Bild wird, stößet und treibt es Sämmtliche zwischen ihm selbst und den Augen befindliche Lust fort;", "1618": "Die nun gleitet hinan zu den Sehwerkzeugen, bestreichelt Gleichsam zuerst die Pupillen und dringt so bis in das Innre.", "1619": "Also geschieht's, daß von jeglichem Ding wir sehen den Abstand;", "1620": "Und je größer die Masse der fortgetriebenen Luft ist, Und in je längerem Strom sie unsere Augen bestreichelt, Um so weiter entfernt erscheint auch jegliches Ding uns.", "1621": "Freilich geschieht das Alles mit solch unglaublicher Schnelle, Daß mit dem Wesen des Dings wir zugleich die Entfernung bemerken.", "1622": "Hiebei haben wir uns im Mindesten nicht zu verwundern, Daß die Bilder, die uns in die Augen treffen, obgleich man Einzeln sie nicht kann sehn, doch sichtbar machen die Dinge.", "1623": "So, wenn in Stößen der Wind einherbraust, schneidende Kälte Herströmt, fühlen wir nicht jedwedes der Theilchen des Windes, Oder des Frosts, vielmehr die Gesammtwirkung;", "1624": "sie erscheint uns, Als ob unserem Körper ein anderer Körper von außen Streiche versetzt' und ihm mittheilte die eigne Empfindung.", "1625": "Dann auch, wenn an den Stein mit dem Finger wir stoßen, be­ rühren Blos sein Aeußerstes wir und die oberste Farbe;", "1626": "wir fühlen Beim Anrühren sie nicht, wir fühlen dagegen die Härte, Die durchweg in dem Stein, im Innern desselben enthalten.Auf, und vernimm nunmehr, weßhalb im Spiegel wir jenseits Sehen das Bild, denn tiefer erscheint? in denselben gerücket:", "1627": "Etwa wie Gegenstände, die draußen wir deutlich erblicken, Wenn die geöffnete Thüre die Durchsicht frei unS gewähret Und aus dem Innern des Hauses so mancherlei draußen uns sehn läßt.", "1628": "Denn es geschiehet das Sehn auch hier durch doppelte Luftschicht:", "1629": "Einmal ist es die Lust, die diesseits lieget der Pfosten;", "1630": "Dann die nach rechts und links sich öffnenden Flügel der Thüre;", "1631": "Drauf wird das Licht von außen die Augen bestreichen und andre Lust und die Gegenstände, die draußen wir deutlich erblicken.", "1632": "So, wenn zuerst vom Spiegel sich losgeworfen das Bild hat, Stößt und treibet es, bis es zu unseren Augen gelanget, Die sich zwischen ihm selbst und den Augen befindende Luft fort Und macht, daß wir noch eher die Lust, als den Spiegel empfinden.", "1633": "Aber nachdem wir den Spiegel nun selbst auch haben empfunden, Kommt das von uns entsendete Bild alsbald auch in diesen Wieder, und kehret geworfen zurück zu unseren Augen;", "1634": "Und dieß treibt eine andere Luft und wälzet sie vor sich, Macht, daß diese noch eher, als selber das Bild, wir erblicken, Weßhalb dieses im Spiegel so weit entfernt uns ershceinen Darum haben sich die im Mindesten nicht zu verwundern, Die auf gedoppelte Schichten der Lust rückführen des Spiegels Wirkung, dieweil durch beide der Schichten die Sache geschiehet.Daß die Theile, die rechts sich an unserem Körper befinden, Go im Spiegel erscheinen, als lägen sie links, das erklärt sich Daraus, daß, wenn das Bild anprallt an der Glätte des Spiegels, Nicht unverändert von hier es zurückkommt, sondern gerades Wegs rückwärts wird gestoßen;", "1635": "sowie, wenn Einer ein thönern Bildstück, eh' es gehörig getrocknet ist, würs' an den Pseiler, Oder den Balken, dasselbe, wofern es gerad' in der Bildung Nur sich erhielt und zurück auf die andere Seite sich drückte, Das, was den Augen zuvor zur Rechten ershcienen, zur Linken Jetzt uns zeiget' und rechts durch selbige Wendung das Linke.Ebenso kommt's, daß ein Bild, von Spiegel zu Spiegel geworfen, So sich zeigt, als wären es fünf, sechs nämliche Bilder;", "1636": "Daß sich Alles, was irgend im Innern des Hauses versteckt ist, Wär' es auch noch so schief und völlig entrückt dem Gesichts- kreis, Durch die gekrümmeten Gänge heraus läßt leiten vermittelst Mehrerer Spiegel, und in den Gemächern bei sich erblicken:", "1637": "So sehr leuchtet das Bild von Spiegel zu Spiegel herüber.", "1638": "Ist nun die Linke gegeben, so wird aus dieser die Rechte, Die kehrt abermal um und wendet sich wieder zur erstern.Ja, diejenigen Spiegel, die Seitenflächen besitzen, Ausgestattet mit ähnlicher Beugung unseres Körpers, Senden uns rechts deßwegen zurück die Bilder:", "1639": "entweder, Weil von Spiegel zu Spiegel hinübergeworfen das Bild wird, Und so doppelt geprägt uns zufliegt;", "1640": "oder auch darum, Weil sich während des Kommens das Bild umwendet, indem des Spiegels gebogne Figur dasselbe nach uns sich zu drehn lehrt.", "1641": "Ferner noch kommt dir's vor, als wandelten mit uns in gleichem Schritte die Bilder einher und machten die gleichen Geberden.", "1642": "Das ist der Grund, weil von der Seite des Spiegels, von welcher Du rücktrittst, nicht plötzlich zurück auch kehren die Bilder;", "1643": "Denn die Natur zwingt Alles, zurück sich vom Andern zu ziehn und Rückwärts wieder zu springen in eben derselbigen Beugung.Glänzenden Dingen entzieht sich das Aug' und wendet den Blick ab;", "1644": "Blendet die Sonne doch selbst, wenn unverwandt man hinein- schaut, Drum, weil ihre Gewalt gar groß ist und aus der Höhe Mächtig die Bilder herab durch den Luftraum werden getrieben, Die dann treffen das Aug' und dessen Gewebe zerrütten.", "1645": "Auch ein schärferer Glanz entzündet zuweilen die Augen, Deßhalb, weil gar viele der feurigen Stoff' er befitzet, Welche, sobald in's Auge sie dringen, ihm Schmerzen erregen.", "1646": "Alles erscheint als gelb, worauf Gelbsüchtige schauen, Weil viel gelblicher Stoff abfließt aus dem Körper des Kranken Und auf die Bilder der Dinge sich setzt, auch finden in seinen Augen sich sonst noch vielerlei Mischungen, welche den Dingen Sich ansetzen und selbe mit häßlicher Bleiche bemalen.Aus dem Finsteren aber erblicken wir das, was im Licht steht, Deßhalb, weil, wenn näher zum Auge gedrungen die schwarze Finstere Luft und fest sich in seiner Oeffnung gesetzt hat, Hinter ihr augenblicklich die glänzende, leuchtende Luft folgt, Welche das Aug' ausputzt und zerstreuet die dunkelen Schatten Jener Luft;", "1647": "denn in vielen Beziehungen reger ist diese, Vielfach seiner beschaffen und mehr an Kräften vermögend.", "1648": "Hat nun diese die Wege der Augen erfüllet mit Lichte, Offen gelegt die Gänge, wo vorher wohnte die schwarze:", "1649": "Sogleich folgen dann auch, entledigt der Hülle, die Bilder, Die im Lichte sich finden, und reizen uns, daß wir sie sehen.", "1650": "Andererseits geht's nicht, aus dem Licht in's Dunkel zu schauen, Darum, weil erst später die dickere, finstere Luft folgt, Die nun alle die Oeffnungen füllt und den Augen den Zugang Absperrt, daß die Gebilde der Dinge, die von ihr bedeckt sind, Sich aus keinerlei Weis' in Bewegung zu setzen vermögen.Daß, wenn von weitem der Stadt viereckige Thürme wir sehen, Rund uns dieselben erscheinen, hat darin seine Begründung, Weil, aus der Ferne betrachtet, ein jeglicher Winkel sich stumpf zeigt, Vielmehr gänzlich vershcwindet, der Abstoß nimmer vorhanden Und deßwegen auch nimmer erreichbar unserem Blick ist;", "1651": "Weil die Masse von Lust, durch welche die Bilder sich treiben, Durch fortwährende Stöße sie nöthiget stumpfer zu werden.", "1652": "Da dem Gesichtssinn nun sich jeglicher Winkel entziehet, Kommt's, daß der steinerne Bau uns ershceint, als wär' er ge­ rundet :", "1653": "Nicht so, freilich, wie Dinge, die nah und in Wirklichkeit rund sind, Sondern nur ähnlich geformt und in unvollkommenem Abriß.So scheint uns in der Sonne der Schatten sich auch zu bewegen, Unseren Tritten zu folgen, uns nach in Geberden zu ahmen;", "1654": "Wenn du anders von einer des Lichtes beraubeten Luft magst Glauben, sie geh' und begleite des Menschen Geberd' und Bewegung;", "1655": "Denn nichts Andres, als eine des Lichtes beraubete Luft, kann Jene Erscheinung sein, die Schatten zu nennen wir pflegen.", "1656": "Dieß wird aber bewirkt, wenn wir, fortschreitend im Gehen, Fern von bestimmeten Stellen des Bodens halten der Sonne Licht;", "1657": "doch füllt urplötzlich sich wiederum, was wir verließen.", "1658": "Also geschieht's, daß immer der vorige Schatten des Körpers Nachzufolgen uns scheint, und auch von der nämlichen Seite;", "1659": "Denn es ergießet sich stets das erneuete Licht von den Strahlen, Während das erste verlischt, als zöge man Wolle durch Feuer.", "1660": "Leicht wird folglich des Lichtes dcr Boden bekundet, und leicht auch Wieder gefüllt und waschet sich rein von den dunkelen Schatten.", "1661": "Nie auch geben wir zu, daß hier sich täuschen die Augen;", "1662": "Denn, wo überall Licht, wo Schatten sich finde, zu sehen Ist ihr Geschäft;", "1663": "doch, ob es das nämliche Licht, ob derselbe Schatten, der hier war, sei, und jetzo vorübergezogen, Oder es vielmehr so, wie oben gesagt sich verhalte:", "1664": "Das zu entscheiden ist schließlich die Sache verständigen Urtheils, Denn kein Aug' ist im Stande, der Dinge Natur zu erforschen:", "1665": "Deßhalb dichte du nimmer dem Auge die Fehler des Geists an.Wann im Schiffe wir fahren, so scheint dieß stille zu stehen, Jenes dagegen, das ruht auf der Rinde, vorüber zu gleiten;", "1666": "Hügel und Au'n auch scheinen zum Hinterverdeck zu entfliehen, Wann mit gebläheten Segeln vorbei an denselben wir steuern.Scheinen ja auch, wie fest an's Himmelsgewölbe geheftet, Still die Gestirne zu stehn, und sind doch in steter Bewegung;", "1667": "Nämlich sie steigen herauf und sinken hinunter im Fernen, Wenn durchmefsen den Himmel sie haben mit leuchtendem Körper.", "1668": "Gleichergestalt scheint Sonn' und Mond an der Stelle zu bleiben, Während die Sache doch selbst anzeigt, daß sich beide bewegen.Weit von einander im Meer aufragende Felsen, daß Flotten Zwischen denselben hindurch ungehindert zu segeln vermöchten, Scheinen von Weitem vereint, ein einziges größeres Eiland.Säulen und Hausflur scheinen dem Knaben, nachdem er sich selber Lange genug hat gedreht und nun aufhört, sich im Kreise Fort und fort noch zu drehn, daß kaum er vermag zu begreifen, Wie nicht auf ihn herab sich stürze das ganze Gebäude.Wenn mit zitterndem Licht die Natur früh Morgens die rothe Fackel beginnt zu erheben und über die Berge zu tragen, Dann sind öfter die Berg', auf denen die Sonne zu stehen Und sie mit feuriger Glut unmittelbar scheint zu berühren, Kaum entfernet von uns zweitausend Schüsse des Bogens, Manchmal kaum fünfhundert sogar von Würfen des Speeres.", "1669": "Zwischen der Sonn' und den Bergen jedoch ist mächtig gedehnter Meerraum, untergebreitet den weiten ätherischen Küsten;", "1670": "Auch viel Tausend der Länder befinden sich zwischen denselben, Von gar mancherlei Völkern bewohnt und Geschlechtern der Thiere.", "1671": "Aber gesammeltes Wasser, das kaum in der Höhe des Fingers Stehn bleibt zwischen Gestein auf Straßen umher und auf Wegen, Bietet uns solchen gewaltigen Anblick unter der Erde, Als von der Erde der Schlund Hochauf gähnt gegen den Himmel;", "1672": "So daß Wolken und Himmel du unter der Erde zu sehen Glaubst, und Körper, versteckt in des Himmels Wunderershceinung.Wenn uns das muthige Roß stehn bleibt in der Mitte des Stromes, Und wir schauen hinab in die reißenden Wellen, so scheinet Strom-aufwärts uns getrieben der Körper des stehenden Thiers durch Irgend 'ne Kraft und jach sich diesem entgegen zu drängen;", "1673": "Und wo wir immer den Blick hinwerfen, da scheinet uns Alles Fort sich zu treiben und auf ganz ähnliche Weise zu fluthen.", "1674": "Endlich der Säulengang, ob schnurgrad auch er sich hinzieht, Immer der nämliche bleibt, gleichmäßig auf Säulen gestützet, Ziehet sich, wenn ganz außen am Ende du stehst und das Ganze Ueberschaust, allmälig in kegelspitzige Form zu, Eint mit dem Boden das Dach, und Alles, was rechts, mit dem Linken, Bis in die dunkele Spitze des Kegels endlich er ausläuft.So auch scheint Seefahrern die Sonn' aus den Wogen zu steigen, Unterzugehn in den Wogen und dort ihr Licht zu verbergen, Sintemal sie nichts weiter erblicken, als Wasser und Himmel:", "1675": "Glaube daher nicht leichtlich, es liege die Schuld an den Sinnen.Meerunkundigen aber erscheinen im Hafen die Schiffe Lahm an der Hinteren Wand, entgegen den Fluthen zu treiben, Denn der Theil von den Rudern, der vorsteht über die Salzfluth, Zeigt sich gerad', und gerade des Schiffs vorragendes Steuer;", "1676": "Aber was unter die Fluthen versenkt ist, scheinet gebrochen, Wieder zurück sich zu beugen und hin nach oben zu wenden Und in der Beugung fast aus der Oberfläche zu schwimmen.", "1677": "Wenn zur nächtlichen Zeit am Himmel zerstreutes Gewölke Führen die Winde dahin, dann scheinen die glänzenden Sterne Gegen dieselben zu gleiten, in ihrem erhabenen Lause Auf ganz andere Bahn, als sonst sie gemacht, sich zu wenden.", "1678": "Wenn es geschieht, daß die Hand an's Auge man bringt und dasselbe Aufwärts drückt, macht dieses die Wirkung, daß wir vermeinen, Alles, wohin sich wenden die Blicke, gedoppelt zu sehen:", "1679": "Doppelt den Leuchter mit hoch ihr Licht ausstrahlenden Kerzen;", "1680": "Doppelt den rings umher im Gebäude befindlichen Hausrath;", "1681": "Doppelt der Menschen Gesicht und doppelt gestaltet die Leiber.Hat mit erquickendem Schlummer der Schlaf uns die Glieder ge­ banden, Daß vollständig der Körper in tiefeste Ruhe versenkt liegt, Scheint es uns doch, als wachten annoch und wären noch regsam Unsere Glieder;", "1682": "wir glauben im nächtlichen Dunkel die Sonne, Mit ihr die Helle des Tages zu schaun;", "1683": "am geschlossenen Orte Glauben vorüberzuziehu wir am Himmel, am Meer und an Strömen Und an Gebirgen, und Fluren mit unserem Fuß zu durchwandern;", "1684": "Töne sogar zu vernehmen, wenn ringsum nächtliche Stille Waltet und Ernst;", "1685": "ja, Reden zu führen, indem wir doch schweigen.Uebrigens sehen wir noch viel Wunderershceinungen der Art, Welche den Sinnen zu traun uns abzuhalten versuchen, Aber umsonst;", "1686": "denn es ist in den häufigsten Fällen die eigne Irrige Meinung, die selbst in die Sache wir tragen, und die dann Sehen uns läßt, was nie uns wurde gezeigt von den Sinnen;", "1687": "Und doch gibt's nichts Schöneres, als augenscheinliche Dinge Von den Zweifeln zu trennen, die selber der Geist noch hinzuthut.Endlich, wenn Einer vermeint, daß Nichts man wisse, so weiß er Selber ja dieß auch nicht, ob Nichts in Allem man wisse.", "1688": "Gerne verzieh? ich darauf, mit Solchem herum mich zu streiten, Welcher den Kopf hinwendet nach eben verlassenen Spuren.", "1689": "Doch, im Fall ich ihm auch zugäbe, daß dieses er wisse, Möcht' ich fragen:", "1690": "von wannen, da vorher nie er die Wahrheit Sah, der Begriff vom Wissen und vom Nichtwissen ihm zukam?", "1691": "Wie er die Kenntniß sich vom Wahren und Falschen erworben, Und er den Zweifel von dem, was gewiß in den Dingen ist, scheide?", "1692": "sAlsdann würde man finden, zuerst aus den Sinnen entstanden Sei die Erkenntniß des Wahren, und erstere nicht widerlegbar;", "1693": "Denn weit größeren Glauben verdient doch immerhin, was aus Eigner Natur mit dem Wahren das Falsche vermag zu besiegen.", "1694": "Wem muß größeren Glauben man schenken sonnt, als den Sinnen?", "1695": "Läßt aus der Sinne Betrug sich ein Schluß ziehn gegen dieselben, Da sich ein jeglicher Grund herleitet allein aus den Sinnen?", "1696": "Weil ja, wenn diese betrügen, zugleich auch alle Vernunft trügt.", "1697": "Wäre das Ohr im Stande, dem Auge Verweise zu geben?", "1698": "Oder dem Ohr das Gefühl, und des Mundes Geschmack dem Gefühle?", "1699": "Oder bestritte die Nase, was gegenerweisen die Augen?", "1700": "Nicht so — dünket mich — iM, denn seine besondere Kraft ist Jedem ertheilt, sein eignes Vermögen auch jedem, und darum Muß, was weich, was kalt, was heiß, nothwendig den Sinnen Auch so scheinen, sie müßen der Dinge verschiedene Farben, Und was noch mit den Farben verbunden, besonders empfinden.", "1701": "So hat des Mundes Geschmack sein eignes Vermögen, sein eignes So der Geruch, das Gehör sein eigenes, was uns beweisen Daß kein Sinn je den andern zu widerlegen vermöge.", "1702": "Ja, es vermöcht' auch selbst nicht einer den andern zu tadeln, Weil stets jedem von ihnen derselbige Glaube gebühret, Folglich auch das, was zu jeglicher Zeit sie bethätigen, wahr ist.", "1703": "Und wenn gleich die Vernunft nicht kann darlegen die Gründe, Weßhalb, was in der Näh' ein Viereck war, in der Ferne Rund sich zeige, so ist's doch besser, bei mangelnder Kenntniß Irrig den Grund von den beiden Figuren zu geben, als dach wir Ließen den Händen entwischen, was klar uns lieget vor Augen, Anzutasten den obersten Glauben und alle die Stützen Niederzuwerfen, worauf doch Leben beruhet und Wohlfahrt.", "1704": "Nicht blos alle Vernunft stürzt plötzlich zusammen, es stürzt auch Selber das Leben, wo nicht du den Sinnen zu trauen den Muth hast, Fährlichen Gegenden nicht, noch anderen Dingen von der Art Suchst zu entfliehen, und dem, was entgegen dir tritt, dich be­ quemest.", "1705": "Alles ist deßhalb auch nicht weiter, als eiteler Wortschwall, Was man als Rüstzeug wählt, tun gegen die Sinne zu streiten,Endlich, wie bei'm Bauwesen geschieht, wenn falsch nur die erste Linie läuft, von der richtigen Flucht abweichet das Richtmaß Und um ein Winziges nur aus die Seite sich neiget das Bleiloth, Daß voll Fehler und schief dastehet das ganze Gebäude, Hängend nach vorn oder hinten, gedrückt, Abstoßend und häßlich, So daß Manche? in Bälde den Einsturz droht und auch wirtlich Stürzt, da gleich im Beginne die richtige Regel verfehlt war:", "1706": "Ebenso muß die Vernunft nothwendig als falsch und betrüglich Dir sich erweisen, sobald von betrÄglichen Sinnen sie ausgeht.", "1707": "Wie von den übrigen Sinnen nun jeder von dem, was ihn angeht.", "1708": "Habe Gefühl, daS ermitteln wir auf nicht schwierigem Wege.Erstlich, den Schall und die Stimme vernehmen wir, wenn zu dem Ohre Dringen die Stoffe derselben und schlagen an dessen Organe:", "1709": "Drum auch muß man bekennen, daß beide, der Schall und die Stimme, Körperlich seien, dieweil sie die Sinne vermögen zu rühren.", "1710": "Deßhalb reizt auch öfter die Stimme den Schlund, und das laute, Weithin tönende Schrei'n macht rauh und heiser die Kehle.", "1711": "Denn, wenn die Stoffe des Lautes, gedrängt in größere Hausen, Sich anschicken, den Weg durch?", "1712": "Enge nach außen zu nehmen, Wird, wenn die Pforte des Mundes gefüllt ist, rauh auch der Ausgang, Und es verletzet die Stimme den Pfad, durch den sie hinausgeht.", "1713": "Nicht ist zu zweifeln daher, es bestehen die Stimmen und Worte Aus Urstoffen von Körpern;", "1714": "sie können ja so nur verletzen.Auch entgeht eS dir nicht, wie sehr für den Körper ermüdend, Wie abspannend für Nerven und jeglicher Kraft uns beraubend Sei fortwährendes Reden, vom frühesten Strahle des Morgens Ununterbrochen geführt, bis Nacht und Dunkel hereinbricht, Sonderlich, wenn eS, verbunden mit lautem Geschrei, sich ergießet.", "1715": "Körperlich muß deßhalb nothwendig der Stimme Natur sein, Weil durch häufiges Sprechen ein Theil vom Körper daraufgeht.", "1716": "Auch nicht ähnlich an Form durchdringen die Stoffe die Ohren, Wenn tief brüllet die Tuba mit niedergehaltnem Geschmetter, Und daS gebogene Horn rückhallet von dumpfem Gebrumme z Oder der Schwan, vom Tode geängstet, in Helieons Thälern Mit wehklagender Stimm' anhebt sein schmelzendes Sterblied.Alle die Töne somit, die tief ans dem Körper wir pressen Und auf geradestem Weg zum Mund aussenden, sie werden Kunstreich durch die Bewegung der Zunge zu Worten gegliedert, Auch durch die eigene Bildung der Lippen gebeugt und gesormet.", "1717": "Aber der rauhere Ton entsteht aus rauherem Urstoff, Wie gleichfalls auch der glatte von glätteren Stoffen erzeugt wird.Ist nun der Zwischenraum nicht groß, aus welchem die Stimme Herkommt, müssen wir auch nothwendig die einzelnen Worte Scharf und deutlich vernehmen und unterscheiden nach Gliedrung, Denn es erhält sich die Bildung des Worts, es erhält die Figur sich.", "1718": "Wenn hingegen das Wort herkommt aus weiterem Abstand, Mischt dasselbe sich auch nothwendig mit größerem Lustraum, Und es verwirrt sich der Laut, indem aus der Lust er daherfliegt.", "1719": "Daher kommt's, daß den Schall zwar hören du kannst, doch mit nichten Untershceiden, was seie der einzelnen Worte Bedeutung:", "1720": "Also verwirrt sich der Laut und wird undeutlich im Kommen.Ferner, ein einziges Wort, vom Mund entsendet des Herolds, Tönt ost Jedem in's Ohr vom ganzen versammelten Volke, Denn es zertheilt sich plötzlich in viele die einzige Stimme, Flieget nach hier und nach dort, da jeglichem Ohr sie besonders Sich mittheilet, bezeichnend den Klang und die Bildung der Worte.Doch der Theil von den Lauten, der nicht zu den Ohren gelangt, wird Wirkungslos vorübergesührt und verfliegt in die Lüfte.", "1721": "Wieder ein Theil auch wirst sich an dichtere Körper und prallet Schallend zurück und täuscht manchmal mit dem Bilde des Wortes.Weil du nun das einsiehst, mein Trefflichster, kannst du getrost auch Rechenschaft dir selber und Anderen geben, worin wohl Suchen man müsse den Grund, daß an einsamen Orten die Felsen Ordnungsmäßig erwidern die nämlichen Formen der Worte, Wenn wir Freund' aussuchen, die zwischen beschatteten Bergen Schweifen umher, und mit lautem Geschrei die Zerstreueten rufen.", "1722": "Sechsfach, siebensach hab' ich das Echo vernommen von Worten, Die man nur einmal rief:", "1723": "so warf ein Hügel dem andern Widerhallend sie zu, um wieder zurück sie zu bringen.", "1724": "Derlei Gegenden malen die Grenznachbarn, als von Nymphen Und bocksfüßigen Satyrn bewohnet, sich aus, und von Faunen:", "1725": "Diese, behaupten sie, treiben des Nachts umher sich und stören Durch ihr Gelärm und loses Geschäcker die schweigende Ruhe;", "1726": "Klänge der Saiten vernehme man dann und die schmelzende Klage, Welche die Flöt' ausgießt, vom Finger des Sängers geschlagen;", "1727": "Weit und breit auch horchen die Landesbebauer, sobald Pan Schüttelt sein halbwild Haupt, umgeben mit fichtenem Walle, Und mit gebogener Hippe durchläuft die geöffneten Halme, Daß die Schalmei nicht ruhet, den Hirtengesang zu entlocken.", "1728": "Mehreres redet man noch von derlei Wundergeshcichten.", "1729": "Daß nicht auch von den Göttern sogar man die einsamen Orte Wähne geflohn, stafsirt man sie aus mit allerlei Wundern, Oder von anderem Grunde geleitet noch:", "1730": "ist doch das ganze Menschengeschlecht gar gierig, das Ohr nach Geschichtchen zu spitzen.", "1731": "Uebrigens darf es dir nicht ausfallen, daß selber durch solche Orte, durch welche das Aug' nicht durchzublicken im Stand ist, Stimmen zu uns Herdringen und wirken auf unsere Ohren:", "1732": "e Hören wir doch ein Gespräch auch ost durch vershclossene Thüren.", "1733": "Nämlich die Stimme vermag durch der Dinge gewundene Gänge Ohne Gefährde zu gehn, doch weigern sich dessen die Bilder;", "1734": "Denn sie zerreißen, sobald ihr Durchgang nimmer gerad ist, Wie durch Poren des Glases, wo ganz durchstreichet das Bildniß.Weiter:", "1735": "nach jeglicher Seite vermag sich der Schall zu ver­ theilen, Weil aus dem einen der andre entsteht;", "1736": "doch, ist er zersprungen Einmal, streut er in viele sich aus, wie der Funke des Feuers Ost in mehrere Funken sich pflegt zu zerstreun und zu theilen:", "1737": "Demnach füllet mit Tönen sich jeglicher Ort, und ob Alles Noch so versteckt auch sei, doch wird vom Schall es gewecket.", "1738": "Aber die Bilder zumal, sind einmal gesandt sie, verfolgen Gradaus immer die Richtung, daher Niemand auch im Stand ist, Ueber Verhacke zu schaun, doch Töne vernimmt er von auswärts.", "1739": "Selber die Stimme sogar, indem sie verschlossene Wege e Durchläuft, stumpfet sich ab und dringet verworren zum Ohre, Daß zwar wohl wir den Schall, doch minder die Worte vernehmen.", "1740": "Wie wir den Saft empfinden vermittelst der Zung' und des Gaumens, Das hat tieferen Grund, es erheischt auch größere Mühe.Erstlich, wir fühlen im Munde den Saft, wenn die Speise durch Kauen Wir ausdrücken, gerad, wie wenn mit der Hand man das Wasser Aus dem geschwängerten Schwamm ausdrückt, den trocknen man möchte.", "1741": "Was man heraus nun gedrückt, das wird durch des Gaumens Kanäle Gänzlich verführet, sowie durch die Röhren der lockeren.", "1742": "Zunge.", "1743": "Wenn von glatter Natur nun die Stoffe des flüssigen Safts sind, Ist die Berührung mild und es füllen mit mildem Geschmack sich Ringsum alle die feuchten, die schweißigen Kammern der Zunge;", "1744": "Aber, je rauher sie sind und in größerer Menge verbunden, Stechen sie nur um so mehr und reizen in uns den ^Geschmakcs-Minn.", "1745": "Aber bis dahin nur empfinden die Lust wir vom Saft, wo Endet der Gaum;", "1746": "doch wenn er hinab sich zum Schlunde gesenkt hat, Ist das Vergnügen vorbei, er vertheilt sich umher in den Gliedern.", "1747": "Wenig auch liegt daran, wodurch sich der Körper ernähre, Wenn das Genossene nur du richtig verdauet in alle Glieder vertheilst und genügender Saft im Magen verbleibet.", "1748": "Nunmehr zeig' ich, warum ein Thier die Speis' und ein andres Andre genießt, und warum, was widrig dem einen und herb ist, Wiederum süß und lieblich das andere könne bedünken.So groß ist hierin die Verschiedenheit und der Abstand, Daß, was Speise dem einen, dem andern verderbliches Gift wird.", "1749": "Richtig ist das, daß Schlangen, berührt vom Speichel des Men­ schen, Sterben, indem sie sich selber zernagen und also vernichten.", "1750": "Ebenso ist Nießwurz für uns ein Gift das den Tod bringt, Während dagegen den Ziegen und Wachteln das Fett sie vermehret.Daß, wie dieses sich Alles verhalte, du mögest erkennen, Mußt du zuerst dich erinnern an das, was oben ich sagte:", "1751": "Daß aus mancherlei Weise der Stoff in den Dingen gemischt sei;", "1752": "Ferner, daß jegliches Thier, das Nahrung genießt, wie von außen Jedes vershcieden vom andern nach Umriß ist und nach Gattung, Und, wie von außen beschränkt bei jedem die Glieder sich zeigen, Ebenso auch nach Stoff und Figur abweiche von andern.", "1753": "Sind nun verschieden die Stoffe, so sind auch die Räume dazwischen, Wie auch die Gänge, die Poren zu nennen wir pflegen, verschieden Rings in den Gliedern umher, im Mund und selber im Gaumen;", "1754": "Einige kleiner somit und andere größer;", "1755": "die einen Müssen die Form darstellen des Dreiecks, andre des Vierecks;", "1756": "Viele davon sind rund, viel' haben auch mancherlei Winkel.", "1757": "Denn so, wie es der Stoffe Figur und Bewegung erfordert, Müssen die Poren sich auch in ihren Figuren verändern Und sich die Gänge verändern, beschränkt durch eignes Gewebe.", "1758": "So wird denn, was lieblich dem Einen ist, bitter dem Andern:", "1759": "Wer's als lieblich empfindet, den müssen die glattesten Stoffe Sanft nur rühren und so eingehn in des Gaumens Kanäle;", "1760": "Während dagegen bei dem, der herb im Innern dasselbe Ding empfindet, es rauh' und hakig hinein in den Schlund dringt.Nun ist's leicht, aus diesem das Uebrige auch zu erkennen.", "1761": "Wer, wenn in ihm sich die Galle gehaust, vom Fieber befallen, Oder aus anderem Grund von Krankheit heftig erregt wird, Dem wird gänzlich zerrüttet der Körper, und sämmtliche Stoffe Werden verrückt bei ihm aus der ordnungsmäßigen Lage.", "1762": "Daher kommt es denn auch, daß Körper, die sonst sich dem Sinne Wohl anpaßten, sich jetzt nicht mehr anpassen, dagegen Andre genehmer ihm sind, die Empfindung wecken des Herben.", "1763": "Beiderlei Körper nun sind im Geschmacke des Honigs vereinigt, Was ich dir mehrfach schon im Obigen habe gezeiget.Auf, ich behandle nun das, wie, wenn der Geruch sich der Rase Nähert, auf diese er wirkt.", "1764": "Für's Erste, so gibt es der Dinge Viele, woraus sich der Strom von vershciednen Gerüchen hervor-wälzt;", "1765": "Nicht ist an Ausfluß, Trieb und Verbreitung derselben zu zweifeln.", "1766": "Aber sie eignen sich

Geier das Aas;", "1769": "auch sucht, wo des Wildes gespaltne Klaue die Fährt' hinlenkte, mit Gier der entlassene Hund sie Auf, und von weither wittert, wenn Menschen sich nahn, den Geruch schon Sie, der Romulischen Burg Errett'rin, die schimmernde Weißgans.", "1770": "So führt also die Wittrung ein Jedes zu der ihm bestimmten Nahrung, und zwingt es, zurück vor widrigem Gifte zu scheuen:", "1771": "Und das ist es, wodurch sich erhalten der Thiere Geschlechter.", "1772": "Dieser Geruch nun selbst, der, die Nase berührend, sie reizet, — Sei's, daß der eine sich weiter, der andre beschränkter ver­ breite — Wird so weit in die Ferne doch nun und nimmer getragen, Wie beim Schall und der Stimme geschieht;", "1773": "ich geschweige der Bilder, Die aus die Schürfe des Augs einwirken und reizen die Sehkraft:", "1774": "Langsam kommt er herbei, irrt um und verlieret sich mälig Vorher schon, und wird in die leichteren Lüste zerstreuet, Da aus dem Innern zuerst nur mühsam er sich entwickelt.", "1775": "Denn, daß von innen heraus der Geruch entströme den Dingen, Liefert uns das den Beweis, daß alles Zerbrochene stärker Riecht, auch alles Zerriebne und alles vom Feuer Versengte.", "1776": "Ferner ist gar kein Zweifel, aus größeren Stoffen geschaffen Sei der Geruch, als der Schall, da steinerne Mauern der erstre Nicht durchdringt, durch welche doch Schall und Stimme sich schwingen.", "1777": "Schwieriger muß es daher bei riechenden Dingen ershceinen, Aufzufinden den Ort, an welchem dieselben versteckt sind.", "1778": "Während er nämlich verweilt, erstarret der Trieb in den Lüften Und eilt nicht mehr warm zu dem Sinn und kündet die Sach' an:", "1779": "Drum auch irren so häufig die Hunde vergeblich der Spur nach.Doch nicht lediglich bei dem Geruch und bei dem Geschmack ist Dieses der Fall;", "1780": "auch sind die Gestalten und Farben der Dinge Alle zumal nicht gleich annehmlich jeglichem Sinne, So, daß einer davon nicht mehr, als der andre, gereizt wird.", "1781": "Wie sonst könnten dem Hahn, der die Nacht mit schlagenden Flügeln Scheucht und mit lautem Krähen die Morgenröthe herbeiruft, Richt entgegen sich stellen die grimmigen Löwen und ihn nicht Anschaun?", "1782": "denken sie doch ihm möglichst schnell zu entfliehen.", "1783": "Nämlich, es sind im Körper des Hahns Stofftheile vorhanden Solcher Natur, daß, wenn in's Auge deS Löwen sie treffen, In die Pupillen sie ihm sich bohren und heftige Schmerzen Zuziehn, daß er den Blick nicht aushält, er, der so wild ist;", "1784": "Während dieselben für uns doch gar nichts Störendes haben, Sei's nun, daß sie durchaus nicht durchzudringen vermögen, Oder doch, drängen sie durch, frei steht aus den Augen der Ausgang, Daß im Verweilen sie nicht im Mindesten diese verlegen.Aus nun!", "1785": "WaS das Gemüth uns erreg' und wie das, was von außen Kommt, zu dem Geiste gelange, vernimm mit Wenigem jetzo.Erstlich behaupt' ich das, daß mancherlei Bilder der Dinge Schwärmen auf allerlei Weise, nach jeglicher Seite getrieben, Zarte, die leicht in der Lust sich zusammenzufügen vermögen, Wenn sie sich treffen, wie Spinnengeweb' und Blättchen des Goldes;", "1786": "Sintemal ungleich seiner sie sind und von dünnrem Gewebe, Als die, welche das Aug' im Sehn saßt und dann gereizt wird:", "1787": "Denn sie dringen hinein in die winzigsten Poren des Körpers, Wecken den zarten Geist im Innern und reizen den Sinn uns.", "1788": "So denn sehen wir auch Centauren und Glieder der Scyllen, Schlünde des höllischen Hunds, wir sehen Gestalten von Solchen, Deren Gebein, da sie längst todt sind, umfasset die Erde;", "1789": "Weil ja zerstreut umstiegen Gebilde von allerlei Arten, Welche sich theils in der Lust durch freies Gebahren erzeugen, Theils von Dingen verschiedener Art entweichen und fliehen Und, aus deren Figuren zusammengesetzet, sich bilden.", "1790": "Sicherlich stammt doch nicht aus dem Leben das Bild deS Centauren, Weil in der Dinge Natur niemals ein solches Geschöpf war;", "1791": "Sondern, wenn zufällig die Bilder des Rosses und Menschen Treffen zusammen, so hängen sie schnell, wie ich oben bemerkte, Wegen der zarten Natur und dem seinen Geweb an einander.Mehreres noch der Art entsteht auf die nämliche Weise, Was, da mit rashcer Bewegung und äußerst leicht es dahinschlüpft, Uns — wie ich früher gezeigt — durch einen vereinzelten Anstoß Als ein zartes Gebilde die Seele vermag zu erregen:", "1792": "Denn die selber ist zart und zum Erstaunen beweglich.Daß dieß wirklich so sei, ist daraus leicht zu erkennen:", "1793": "Weil das, was mit dem Geist und den Augen wir sehen, einander Aehnlich ist, so muß es auf Ähnliche Weis' auch entstehen.", "1794": "Run denn, da ich gelehrt, daß etwa Gebilde der Löwen Das mich lassen erblicken, wodurch mein Auge gereizt wird, Läßt sich ersehn, daß ähnlich der Geist von Gebilden der Löwen Und von dem Uebrigen allen erregt wird, das er gerad so Sieht, wie die Augen es sehn, wenn schon weit feiner und zarter.Aus nicht anderem Grund bleibt, wann sich der Körper in i Schlummer Hingießt, wacheick der Geist, als weil fortwährend dieselben Bilder noch reizen den Geist, die, während wir wachten, unS reizten:", "1795": "So sehr, daß wahrhaftig Denselben zu sehen wir glauben, Dessen der Tod schon längst sich bemächtiget hat und die Erde.", "1796": "Hiezu zwingt die Natur, weil alle Gefühle des Körpers, Die nun

Um zu erkennen den Trug, als sähe der Geist noch im Leben Einen, der lang vorher hinschied und hinab in das Grab stieg.Uebrigens wundre dich nicht, daß Bilder sich scheinen zu regen, Regelgemäß auch

sich denken, die ganz abweichen von diesen?Was ist's ferner noch, wenn im Schlaf wir die Bilder einher­ gehn Sehn im geregelten Zug und biegsam regen die Glieder, Und nicht weniger biegsam die Arm' in einander verschränken, Auch zugleich mit den Augen der Beugung folgen des Fußes?", "1806": "Triefen dann etwa die Bilder von Kunst und schwärmen, belehrt schon, Nächtlicher Weil' umher, um ihr Scherzfpis da zu betreiben?", "1807": "Oder ist mehr Wahrheit darin:", "1808": "weil dieses Kur gleichen Zeit wir zusammenempfinden, daß auch, wie im einzelnen Wortlaut, Mehrere Zeiten im Punkte versteckt find, die der Verstand forscht?", "1809": "Daher kommt's, daß zu jeglicher Zeit und an jeglichem Orte Bilder von jeglicher Art vor Augen uns stehn und bereit sind;", "1810": "So groß ist der

Dingen, Wenn du den Geist nicht richtest darauf, wahrnehmen, daß solche Weit entfernt, nach der Zeit, wie auch nach dem Raume, von uns find.", "1817": "Weßhalb wolltest du nun dich wundern, daß für die Seele All die Bilder, auf die sie sich nicht anstrenget, zu Grund gehn?", "1818": "Dann auch vermuthen wir oft bei kleinen Ershceinungen Großes, Und wir verwickeln uns selbst in die Schlingen des Trugs und der Täuschung.So auch geschieht's manchmal, daß dem Bild ein andres von andrer Gattung sich unterschiebt;", "1819": "daß das, was eher ein Weib war, Unter den Händen zum Mann sich scheinet verwandelt zu haben, Auch aus dem einen ein andres Gesicht und Alter hervorgeht:", "1820": "Daß wir uns deß nicht wundern, dafür sorgt Schlaf und Vergessen.Suche jedoch bei all den Dingen dem schädlichen Irrthum Möglichst dich zu entziehn und sorglichst davor dich zu wahren, Daß du nicht wähnst, es seien die glänzenden Lichter der Augen Dazu geschaffen, damit hinsehen wir können, und daß nur Deßhalb Schenkel und Beine, gestützt auf die Füße, sich könnten Biegen, um stattliche Schritte zu machen, und auch so die Arme Lediglich deßhalb sei'n mit den kräftigen Schultern verbunden, Auch beidseits zur Bedienung die Hände denselben gegeben, Daß, was das Leben erheischt, wir damit zu verrichten vermögen.", "1821": "Alles das Uebrige noch, was auf derlei Art man erkläret, Ist unrichtig

war da vor entstandenem Lichte der Augen, Noch auch der Sprach' Anwendung vor anerschassener Zunge;", "1824": "Vielmehr ist ja der Zung' Ursprung weit älter, als alles Sprechen, und lang vorher schon waren die Ohren erschaffen, Ehe man Töne vernahm;", "1825": "kurzum, auch sämmtliche Glieder Sind schon vor dem Gebrauch — so wenigstens dünkt mich — gewesen:", "1826": "Demnach konnten sie nicht zum Zweck des Gebrauches erwahcsen.Gegen einander jedoch Faustkämpfe bestehen, die Glieder Sich zerfleischen und gräßlich den Körper mit Blut sich besudeln, War schon lange, bevor hinflogen die schimmernden Pfeile;", "1827": "Und vor Wunden sich hüten, das lehrte zuvor die Natur schon, Ehe der Linken den Schild, durch ihn sich zu decken, die Kunst gab.", "1828": "Auch den ermüdeten Leib

des Lebens erfunden, Magst du, als lediglich nur zum Gebrauche vorhanden betrachten;", "1830": "Anders verhält es jedoch sich mit allen den andern, die, vorher Schon entstanden für sich, den Begriff erst gaben von Nutzen, Wie vor allen wir das bei den Sinnen erblicken und Gliedern.", "1831": "Fern muß also von uns, fern bleiben die irrige Meinung, Als ob wegen des Nutzens allein sie wären erschaffen.Auch nicht darfst du dich wundern ob jegliches Thieres Naturtrieb, Nahrung, wie sein Körper sie eben erheischt, sich zu suchen.", "1832": "Daß auf mancherlei Art von den Körpern Theilchen

Schweiß aus dem Innern gepresset, Vieles auch wird aus dem Munde gehaucht durch Keuchen und Athmen.", "1835": "Hiedurch magert der Körper nun ab und die ganze Natur wird Ueber den Haufen geworfen:", "1836": "die Folg' ist quälender Hunger.", "1837": "Drum ist Speise vonnöthen, damit durch selbe die Glieder Werden gestützt, aus's Neue die Kräfte belebt und der Eßlust Gnüge gethan, die in allen Gefäßen des Leibes sich kund gibt.", "1838": "Ebenso sondert das Flüssige sich in jeglichen Theil ab, Welcher das Flüssige braucht, und zerstreuet die vielen verdickten Säfte, die Glut erregen in unserem Magen, und diese Löscht der genossene Trank wie ^wirkliches) Feuer, damit nicht Ganz ausdörre die Glieder die Alles vertrocknende Hitze.", "1839": "So wird also der lechzende Durst aus unserem Körper Weggeshcwemmet, und so die Begierde nach Speise befriedigt.", "1840": "Nunmehr sag' ich dir noch, wie's komme, daß Schritte nach vor­ wärts Richten wir können nach Willen, gelenksam regen die

Geist die Bilder des GehnS und stoßen ihn an, wie oben bemerkt ward.", "1844": "Draus entstehet der Wille, denn Niemand macht sich an eine Sache, bevor nicht eher der Geist schon sah, was er wolle:", "1845": "Was nun eher er sieht, ist das Bild desselbigen Dinges.", "1846": "Ist im Geiste nun rege der Wille zu gehn und zu schreiten, Stößt urplötzlich er die durch alle Theile des Körpers Und durch sämmtliche Glieder zerstreuete seelische Kraft an:", "1847": "Dieses bewirket er leicht, da beide so nahe verwandt find.", "1848": "Weiter nun stößet die Seel' auf den Körper, und solchergestalt wird Mälig die ganze Masse bewegt und gestoßen nach vonvärts.Außerdem kommt auch das noch vor, daß der Körper sich ausdehnt, Wenn die beständig bewegliche Luft, die Allem sich mittheilt, Reichlich hinein in die Poren sich macht, in die Oeffnungen dringet Und somit sich vermischt mit den winzigsten Theilchen des Körpers.", "1849": "Also geschieht es in doppelter Weis' und aus doppeltem Grunde, Daß, wie das Schiff durch Wind und Segel, der Körper sich fortträgt.", "1850": "Niemals kann es jedoch hiebei als befremdend ershceinen, Daß solch winzigen Stoffen die Kraft inwohnt, den so großen Körper zu drehn und die ganze gewaltige Last zu bewegen.", "1851": "Treibet ja doch auch der Wind, der selber so dünn von Bestand ist, Vor sich mit starkem Bebahren ein mächtiges Schiff, das von einer Einzigen Hand nur, so rasch es dahin auch fegte, regiert wird;", "1852": "Auch ein Steuer nur lenkt es, wohin ihm immer beliebet;", "1853": "Und durch Winden und Hebel bewegen Maschinen die schwersten Lasten und heben empor sie mit gar nicht großem Bemühen.", "1854": "Nunmehr, wie mit Ruhe der Schlummer die Glieder bethaue, Und wie derselbe die Brust von den Sorgen des Geistes erlöse, Will ich in nicht zahlreichen, doch lieblichen Versen verlautbarn.", "1855": "Schwanengesang, der kurz nur dauert, ist besser, als jenes Kranichgekrächz, das schmettert in luftige Wolken des Auster.", "1856": "Schenke du nur aufmerksam Gehör und geschärseten Sinn mir, Daß nicht später du läugnest, was schon ich als möglich erwiesen, Nicht mit entgegenstrebender Brust vom Wahren dich Wendest Und durch eigene Schuld dich selber beraubest der Einsicht.Erstlich, der Schlaf entsteht, indem in den Gliedern die Kraft der Seele sich trennt, die theils sich zurück Ms ihnen gezogen, Theils sich zusammengedrängt und mehr in's Innre gesenkt hat:", "1857": "Dann erst lösen die Glieder sich aus und zerfließen erschlaffet.", "1858": "Denn es besteht kein Zweifel, daß durch Mitwirkung der Seele Wir Empfindung besitzen;", "1859": "da diese der Schlaf nun behindert, Ist zu vermuthen, es werde das Wesen der Seele verstöret Und nach außen gejagt:", "1860": "doch nicht vollständig;", "1861": "es läge Sonst ja der Leib umgössen mit ewigem Froste des Todes, Weil kein Theil von der Seele sodann in den Gliedern verborgen Bliebe zurück, wie unter der Asche das Feuer versteckt ist, Plötzlich daraus das Gefühl hervorzublasen im Körper Und aus der heimlichen Glut auflodern zu lassen die Flamme.Aber, aus was dieß neue Gefühl sich erwecket, wodurh cdie Seele gestört kann werden, erschlafft hinsinken der Körper, Will ich dir jetzt darthun:", "1862": "laß nicht mein Wort in den Wind gehn.Erstlich, dieweil allseits von außen der Körper berührt wird Von der umgebenden Lust, so wird nothwendig derselbe Angegriffen von ihr und erhält vielfältige Stöße:", "1863": "Drum siehst alle Geschöpfe du theils mit Bälgen versehen, Theils mit Schalen bedeckt und mit schwartigen Häuten und Hüllen.", "1864": "Ebenso schlägt die Luft bei den athmenden Thieren die innern Theile, so oft sie hinein sie saugen und wieder verhauchen.", "1865": "Das nun wirkt mit Gewalt auf den Körper von außen und innen;", "1866": "Und da weitere Stöße die winzigsten Theile desselben Noch durchdringen, bis hin zu den uranfänglichen Stoffen, Kommt's, daß die Kraft allmälig in unseren Gliedern erstirbet.", "1867": "Denn es erfolgt in der Lage des Urstoffs, wie bei dem Körper, Störung auch bei der Seele, so daß ein Theil von der letztern Wird nach außen getrieben, ein andrer im Innern sich birget;", "1868": "Wieder ein andrer, umher in den Gliedern zerstreuet, vermag nicht Sich zu verbinden und wechselnd die Regsamkeit zu bewirken, Denn die Natur umzäunt Zugäng' und innre Gemeinschaft, Und es entweicht das Gefühl tief bei der veränderten Regung.", "1869": "Da es nun Nichts mehr gibt, das die Glieder zu stützen vermöchte, Wird entkräftet der Körper und sämmtliche Glieder erschlaffen, Abwärts sinken die Arme, die Augenlider, und oft auch Werden die Bande der Kniee gelockert, die Kräfte gelöset.Schlaf folgt auch auf das Essen, dieweil ganz gleich auch die Speise Wirkt, wie die Luft:", "1870": "auch sie durchdringet das ganze Geäder.", "1871": "Immer der schwereste Schlaf tritt ein, wenn satt wir und müd sind;", "1872": "Denn dann werden zerstoßen mit angestrengtester Arbeit Und in einander gerüttelt die weitaus mehresten Stoffe.", "1873": "Ebendaher auch kommt's, daß einige Theile der Seele Tiefer in's Innre sich ziehn, mehr andere strömen nach außen, Hier mehr innere Theilung sich zeigt, dort größre Zerstreuung.", "1874": "Welchem Berufe man Nun mit besonderem Eifer sich widmet, Oder auf welchem Gebiet wir zuvor am längsten verweilten, Und der Verstand auf solchem den Fleiß am

im heimischen Liede.So nun scheinen auch andre Beschäftigungen und Künste Während des Schlafes den Geist in der Täuschung stets zu erhalten.", "1879": "Und so sehen wir denn bei Manchem, der mehrere Tage Hinter einander mit Fleiße das Schauspiel hatte besuchet, Wenn auch die Dinge bereits aufhörten die Sinne zu reizen, Daß im Geiste doch stets noch offen ihm bleiben die Wege, Durch die eben die Bilder dahin zu gelangen vermögen.", "1880": "Und so schweben sie noch ihm mehrere Tage vor Augen, Daß er sogar im Wkchen'die Tanzenden glaubet zu sehen, Wie die geschmeidigen Glieder sie regen;", "1881": "zur Zitherbegleitung Jenes so schmelzende Lied und die sprechenden Töne der SMdn Glaubt mit dem Ohr zu vernehmen, den nämlichen Kreis der Wer­ sainMüng Und noch alle die Reize des ^bunten

lautes Gebell auf, Zieht auch häufig die Luft mit der Nas' ein, als ob des Wildes Spuren bereits er hätte, gefunden und hielte sie fest schon.", "1885": "Wacht er dabei nun auf, so verfolgt er öfter des Hirsches Trügendes Bild, als säh' auf der Flucht er solches begriffen, Bis nach zerstreueter Täuschung er wieder zurück zu sich selbst kommt.", "1886": "Aber die schmeichelnde Zucht der hausgewöhneten Hündlein Schüttelt den Schlaf von sich und rafft vom Boden den Leib auf, Als ob fremde Gestalten sie sühn und fremde Gesichter.", "1887": "Und je rauher die Stoffe, woraus ein Jedes bestehet, Um so schrecklicher müssen im Schlaf dieselben erscheinen.", "1888": "Aber die Vögel, die bunten, entfliehn und setzen zur Nachtzeit Plötzlich mit Flügelschlage die Haine der Götter in Unruh, Wenn sanft schlummernd sie glauben den Habicht zu sehn, der, nach Kämpfen Und nach Beute begierig, im schwebenden Flug sie verfolget.Was nun der menschliche Geist mit großer Bewegung hervorbringt, Thut er auch und vollbringt er mit großer Bewegung im Schlafe.", "1889": "Könige liefern sich Schlachten, erobern und werden gefangen, Oder erheben Geschrei, als würden sie eben erdrosselt.", "1890": "Mancher auch kämpft und stöhnt, als fühlt' er swirkliche^ Schmerzen;", "1891": "Oder, als ob vom Zahne des Panthers, des grimmigen Leun er Wäre getroffen, erfüllt er Alles mit lautem Geschreie.", "1892": "Viele sodann auch reden im Schlaf von wichtigen Dingen Und verrathen dadurch gar oft ihr eignes Beginnen.", "1893": "Da glaubt Einer zum Tod sich geführt;", "1894": "ein Andrer, als würd' er Hoch vom Gebirge gestürzt in den Abgrund, bebet am ganzen Körper und kommt vom Schlaf, als wäre der Geist ihm gefesselt, Kaum zu sich selber zurück, und Glut durchschüttert i den

Decken.", "1897": "Wenn nun die Hitze der Jugend zuerst bei ihnen sich einschleicht, Und mit den Tagen der Reife der Sam' in den Gliedern sich bildet, Treten von außen Gebilde von allerlei Körpern zusammen, Die ein holdes Gesicht ankünden und herrliche Reize.", "1898": "Nunmehr schwellen die Theile vom Ueberflusse des Samens, Daß, als wäre bereits schon Alles vorüber, sie reichlich Oftmals

"Ist auch fern, was du liebst, so sind doch die Bilder davon dir Immer vor Augen, es schallt in's Ohr dir der liebliche Name.Aber der Anstand fordert, die Bilder zu fliehen, der Liebe Jegliche Nahrung zu nehmen, den Sinn auf Andres zu richten Und den gesammelten Reiz auf allerlei Körper zu werfen, Nicht für den einen zurück ihn zu halten, in den man verliebt ist, Um hiedurch sich vor Sorgen und sicherem Schmerz zu bewahren.", "1911": "Denn das Geschwür wächst an und veraltert, indem es genährt wird;", "1912": "Täglich erhöht sich die Wuth, wird schwerer der Kummer, wo­ fern du Nicht die

heimlich der Stachel ihn noch, selbst das zu verletzen, Was es auch sei, das die Wuth von solchen Begierden emportreibt.", "1917": "Doch beim Liebesgenuß hebt Venus selber die Straf' auf;", "1918": "Schmeichelnd gesellet die Lust sich dazu und bezähmet die Bisse:", "1919": "Denn der Körper, durch welchen das heiße Verlangen erweckt ward, Ist's, an welchem die Flamm' auch löschen zu können man

hin und her in der Lust jagt.Auch bisweilen geschieht's, daß Wolken, die sich begegnen, Nicht mit der Stirn sich stoßen, nur seitwärts streifen sich können, Durch entgegengesetzte Bewegung reibend die Körper.", "2634": "Daher das trockne Geräusch, es reinigt die Ohren und ziehet Lang?", "2635": "sich hin, bis entkommen sie sind den beschränkten Bezirken.", "2636": "Deßhalb auch scheint oft, von gewaltigem Donner erschüttert, Alles zu beben und, rasch auseinander gerissen, die mächt'gen Mauern des vielumfassenden Weltbau's bersten zu wollen, Wenn mit gesammelter Kraft urplötzlich ein starker Orkan sich In das Gewölk eindreht und, verschlossen in diesem, von allher Mit umreißendem Wirbel die Wolke je mehr und je mehr zwingt, Daß mit dichtem Rande gehöhlt dieselbe sich einschließt.", "2637": "Nachher, wenn die Gewalt und der heftige Trieb sich erregt hat, Bricht losschmetternd sie aus mit Schrecken erregendem Krachen.", "2638": "Wundre dich nicht!", "2639": "da selbst ein mit Lust angefülletes Bläschen Oft solch mächtigen Knall, wenn schnell eS zerplatzet, verursacht.Noch ist ein Grund, weßhalb, wenn durch das Gewölke die Winde Blasen, Geräusch entsteht;", "2640": "denn oftmals sehen wir Wolken, Völlig verschieden an Form und rauh und zackig, dahinziehn.", "2641": "Lassen doch auch, wann Caurus Gehölz durchbrauset und Waldung, Lautes Geräusch und Gekrache die Zweig' und Aeste vernehmen.Auch bisweilen geschieht's, daß des mächtigen Windes erregte Kraft, wenn gerad' er auf selbige stößt, durchschneidet die Wolke:", "2642": "Denn was der Wind dort sobenZ vermag, liegt offen zu Tage, Da er ja schon hier suntenZ, wo doch weit linder die Kraft ist, Hochaufragende Bäum' ausreißt mit den tiefesten Wurzeln", "2643": ".Auch durchströmen die Wolken sich selbst und erregen Geräusche, Wenn mit Gewalt an einander sie schlagen;", "2644": "wie das auch in tiefen Flüssen geschieht und im Meer bei stark anschlagender Brandung.Das auch geschieht, wenn der feurige Blitz aus Wolk' in die Wolke Fährt, daß letztre, sobald, mit Nässe gefüllt, sie das Feuer Aufnahm, plötzlich darauf mit lautem Geräusch es ertödtet:", "2645": "Gleichwie glühendes Eisen, aus heißer Esse gezogen, Aufzischt, wenn wir es schnell eintauchen in kaltes Gewässer.Doch, wenn trockner die Wolk', in die einfähret der Blitzstrahl, Brennt sie mit lautem Geräusch, indem sie sich plötzlich entzündet:", "2646": "Wie auf Bergen, besetzt mit Lorbeer», lodert die Flamme, Angefacht von dem Wirbel des Winds, und brausend sich forttreibt;", "2647": "Denn kein anderes Ding, wie Phöbus' delphischer Lorbeer, Wird mit so schrecklichem Prasseln verzehrt von der knisternden Flamme.Endlich verbreiten auch oft Eisstück' und Trümmer des Hagels Lautes Gebraus hoch oben im räumigen Wolkengebiete;", "2648": "Denn vom Winde zusammengestopft und in's Enge getrieben, Werden die Berge, die Schnee und Hagel gehäuset, zerrissen.Ebenso blitzt's, wenn gesammeltes Feuer in Meng' aus den Wolken", "2649": "Durch den Zusammenstoß sich herausschlügt, wie wenn den einen Stein an den anderen Stein und an Eisen man schlüget, denn hier auch Springt dann Feuer heraus und ringsum sprühen die Funken.", "2650": "Aber dm Donner vernehmen wir alsdann erst mit den Ohren, Wann schon glänzen den Blitz wir gesehn, weil stets zum Gehöre Später das Hörbare kommt, als das, was reizet die Sehkraft.", "2651": "Dieses erkennet man auch daraus:", "2652": "wenn aus der Entfernung Mit zweischneidigem Beile den Baum umhauen du siehest, Nimmst du den Streich vorher schon wahr, eh' noch in den Lüsten Solcher erschallt;", "2653": "so sehen wir auch schon eher den Blitzstrahl, Als wir den Donner vernehmen, obschon gleichzeitig sie beide Und aus dem nämlichen Grund, wenn Wolken sich stoßen,

Eingewirbelt, so höhlt und verdickt er sie, wie ich gelehrt schon, Wird durch den Umtrieb selber erhitzt:", "2655": "so siehst du denn Alles Durch die Bewegung in Hitze gerathen;", "2656": "es schmelzen ja selber Bleierne Kugeln im Flug, durch weitere Räume getrieben.", "2657": "Hat der erhitzet« Wind nun die finstere Wolke zerrissen, Streut er die Samen der Glut, die gleichsam Gewalt ihm erpreßte, Plötzlich hinaus, und so entstehen die zuckenden Flammen.", "2658": "Alsdann solget der Schall, der nicht so geschwind dem Gehöre Sich mittheilet, als Das, was gelangt zu unserm Gesichtskreis.", "2659": "Doch ist dieß nur der Fall bei dichtem Gewölk, wenn zugleich es Hoch auf einander gethürmt sich erhebet mit mächtigem Antrieb.Laß dich auch das nicht täuschen, daß unten wir mehr nach der Breite Sehen die Wolken sich dehnen, als wie in der Höh' sie sich ausbaun;", "2660": "Richte den Blick nur hin, wann Wolken, Gebirgen vergleichbar, Werden getragen vom Wind, querhin durch die Lüste gewälzet;", "2661": "Oder in mächtigen Hausen um ragende Berge gelagert Wolk' aus Wolke du siehst, wie so schwer auf die unteren drücken Die in der oberen Lage, wenn rings auch schlafen die Winde.", "2662": "Dann erst wirst du dir klar vorstellen die Größe der Massen, Gleichsam Höhlen erblicken, aus überhangenden Felsen Ausgeführt :", "2663": "wann die sich bei nahenden Wettern mit Winden Haben gefüllt, dann zürnen, von Wolken umschlossen, die letztern Brüllend dahin und drohn, wie in Käfigen Thiere der Wildniß, Schicken ihr dumpfes Gebrüll bald hier bald dort durch die Wolken, Schweifen, den Weg aussuchend, umher und wälzen des Feuers Samen dahin aus den Wolken und drängen gehäuft sie zusammen, Drehn im Innern die Flammen in ihren gehöhleten Oefen, Bis nun die Wolke zerreißt und der glänzende Blitz ihr entführet.Auch aus dem Grund stürzt der bewegliche, goldene Lichtstrahl Jenes gereinigten Feuers vielleicht zur Erde sich nieder, Weil ja der feurigen Samen so viel nothwendig die Wolken Mit sich führen:", "2664": "denn, wichen von ihnen die feuchten Bestände Völlig, so zeigen sie meist sich wie Feuer gesärbet und glänzend:", "2665": "Theilen ja doch nothwendig die Strahlen der Sonne denselben Reichlich sich mit, daß stark sie erröthen und Feuer ergießen.", "2666": "Hat nun der Wind das Gewölk zusammengedränget in Eines Und mit Gewalt es an Orte gezwängt, so presse:", "2667": "er jene Samen heraus, die farbig, wie feurige Flammen, sich spiegeln.Ebenso blitzt's bisweilen, wenn dünn nur am Himmel Gewölk steht:", "2668": "Denn, wenn leicht nur der Wind dasselbe zertheilet im Lause Und auseinander es treibt, so müssen die Samen, woraus sich Bildet der Blitz, aus ihm, selbst unfreiwillig, entfallen:", "2669": "Aber geräuschlos zuckt und ohne zu schrecken der Strahl dann.Uebrigens, wie von Natur nun wirklich beschaffen der Blitz sei, Deutlich erkläret sich das aus den brandigen Mälern des Feuers, Die schwerdrückenden Dampf voll Schwefelgeruches verHauchen:", "2670": "Das sind Zeichen des Feur's, nicht Zeichen des Winds, noch des Regens.Oft entzündet der Blitz auch ragende Gipfel der Häuser, Und übt selber im Innern Gewalt mit reißender Flamme.", "2671": "Dieß feinstoffige Feuer erschuf die Natur aus den ersten Feurigen Stoffen und kleinen, sich immer bewegenden Körpern, Denen sich durchaus Nichts entgegenzusetzen im Stand ist;", "2672": "Denn der gewaltige Blitz dringt selbst durch Mauern und Wände, Wie das Geschrei und der Schall, er dringt durch Felsen und Erzwerk, Macht, daß im Augenblicke das Gold und jedes Metall schmilzt.", "2673": "Auch daß plötzlich der Wein aus ganz unversehrtem Gefäß flieht Wirket er, weil gar leicht er die sämmtlichen Seiten desselben Lockert und dünner sie macht, indem mit Glut

Sonne Nickt vollbringet, bewirket der zuckende, glühende Blitzstrahl:", "2675": "Um so beweglicher ist, um so wirksamer seine Gewaltkraft.Nunmehr, wie sich erzeuget der Blitz und von wannen ihm solche Kraft kommt, daß mit dem Schlag er Thürme vermag zu zer­ spalten, Wohnungen niederzuschmettern, hinweg das Gebälke zu reißen, Auch Denkmale, zur Ehre von Männern errichtet, zu stürzen, Menschen dem Tode zu weih^und Vieh zu Boden zu werfen, Und was des Blitzes Gewalt sonst Alles zu wirken im Stand ist, Leg' ich dir dar, dich nicht mit Versprechungen langer verweilend.Daß sich auch nur aus dichten und hoch auf einander gethürmten Wolken erzeuge der Blitz, ist leicht zu begreifen;", "2676": "denn niemals Fährt er aus heiterem Himmel herab und aus lockrem Gewölke;", "2677": "Schwindet doch jeglicher Zweifel hieran schon vor der Erscheinung, Daß dann rings in der Luft von allwärts her sich die Wolken Drängen zusammen, daß gänzlich die Nacht entwichen dem Orcus Scheinet zu sein und zu füllen die räumigen Höhlen des Himmels:", "2678": "Solch ein Grauen erregend Gesicht von zusammengedrängtem Wettergewölk hängt oben herab im scheuslichen Dunkel, Wann sich der Sturm anschicket, die zuckenden Strahlen zu schleu­ dern.Uebrigens stürzt gar oft auf dem Meer ein schwarzes Gewölle, Das wie ein Pechstrom nieder vom Himmel sich senket, so heftig Sich in die Wogen und zieht noch weit in der dunkelen Nacht hin, Schleppt, mit Blitzen und Stürmen geschwängert, am meisten jedoch mit Feuer und Winden erfüllet, den finstern Wetterorkan nach, Daß auf dem Land auch Alles erbebt und sich sehnet nach Obdach.", "2679": "Hieraus nehme man ab, daß hoch uns über dem Haupte Stehn die Gewitter:", "2680": "sie würden ja sonst mit Finsterniß niemals Also die Erde bedecken, wofern nicht Wolken,

ich ja doch schon oben gelehrt, daß feurige Samen Viel die gehöhleten Wolken enthalten und deren auch viele Müssen empfangen in sich von der Glut und den Strahlen der Sonne.", "2684": "Hat nun der nämliche Wind, der an irgend einen der Orte Vorher zusammen sie zwang, viel Samen des Feuers erpresset, Und zugleich sich vermischt mit dem selbigen Feuer, so dreht er, Eingefangen darin, im Wirbel die Tiefe der Wolken, Schmiedet sodann im Innern den Blitz in der glühenden Esse.Denn auf doppelte Weis' entzündet er sich:", "2685": "er erglühet Durch selbsteigne Bewegung und durch Ansteckung des Feuers.", "2686": "Hat nun stärker der Wind sich erhitzt, und ward von dem Feuer Heftiger er entfacht, so reißt er, gleichsam gereift jetzt, Flugs auseinander die Wolk' und fährt mit glühendem Strahl hin, Welcher nun weit umher mit Glänze die Gegend beleuchtet.", "2687": "Ihm nach folgt der gewaltige Schlag, daß plötzlich gesprenget Scheinet das Himmelsgewölb', und hochab niederzustürzen.",

"Solches Gelärm entsteht, wenn berstet die Wolke, der Windsturm Tobet aus ihr und der Blitz mit brennendem Strahle hinausfährt.", "2691": "Auch ist der Fall, daß ein heftiger Wind, von außen erreget, Trifft auf die schwangere Wolke, die schon von Blitzen gereift ist;", "2692": "Wann nun de r sie zerreißt, entlädt urplötzlich sich jener Feurige Strudel aus ihr, den Wetterleuchten wir nennen.", "2693": "Dieses geschieht auch von anderen Seiten, nach denen der Blitz fährt.Das auch ereignet sich oft, daß ein Windstoß, wenn er auch ohne Feuer entstürzt, im Raum auf längerem Weg sich entzündet:", "2694": "Wenn er vielleicht im Lauf absetzet die gröberen Körper, Die nicht eben so schleunig die Luft zu durchdringen vermögen, Andre dagegen, die selbst er der Luft entreibet, davonführt, Winzige, welche, vermischet mit ihm, im Flug sich entzünden:", "2695": "Auf nicht sehr abweichende Art, wie die bleierne Kugel Oft sich erhitzet im Lauf, indem sie die starrenden Theile Aus sich entfernt und Feuer dafür aufnimmt in den Lüsten.Auch wird selbst durch des Stoßes Gewalt oft Feuer erwecket, Wann, ob feuerlos auch und kalt, stark schlüget der Wind an;", "2696": "Denn wenn mit heftigem Streiche heran er prallt, so vermögen Aus ihm selber die Stoffe des Feuers zusammenzufließen, Wie auch zugleich aus dem von dem Schlage getroffenen Körper:", "2697": "So entfließt denn auch Feuer den Steinen, an die man mit Eisen Schlägt, und ob kalt von Natur auch selber das Eisen ist, treffen Doch beim Schlage die Samen des feurigen Funkens zusammen.", "2698": "Ebenso muß vom Blitz auch Alles in Flammen gerathen, Was zugänglich denselben sich immer erweist und entzündbar.", "2699": "Aber so durchaus kalt läßt doch unmöglich der Wind sich Denken, der mit solch großer Gewalt von oben herabfährt, Daß er nicht vorher schon, wenn auch nicht erst er im Laufe Sich entzündet, erwärmt ankäm' und gemischet mit Glutstoff.", "2700": "Aber des Blitzes bewegliche Kraft und gewaltiger Schlag, auch Daß in so eiligem Flug er herab sich stürzet zur Erde, Kommt daher, weil all die erregete Kraft, die zuvor schon War in den Wolken vereint, nun strebt zu gewaltigem Ausbruch.", "2701": "Drauf, wenn nimmer die Wolke genüget dem wachsenden Andrang, Drückt mit Gewalt er sich los und fliegt mit erstaunlichem Fortschuß, Wie hinflieget die Last, aus schwerem Geschütze geschleudert.Füge noch bei, daß der Blitz aus glatten und winzigen Stoffen, Denen so leicht sich Nichts kann widersetzen, bestehet:", "2702": "Deßhalb fähret er auch und dringt durch die engesten Gänge.", "2703": "Und so läßt er sich auch, wie viel er auch Hinderndes finde, Nicht aufhalten:", "2704": "er stürzet dahin im eiligsten Fluge.Ferner, ein jedes Gewicht strebt abwärts seiner Natur nach;", "2705": "Wenn zu demselben sich dann noch gesellet ein äußerer Anstoß, Wird die Geschwindigkeit noch verzwiesacht, stärker der Trieb noch, So daß hest'ger und schneller es Alles zerschlägt, was im Laufe Sich in den Weg ihm stellt und es hindert, die Bahn zu verfolgen.", "2706": "Endlich, was weither schon mit heftigem Triebe herankommt, Legt sich Geschwindigkeit zu, die beständig wächset im Fortgang, Stets auch die Kräfte vermehrt und die Stärke des Schlages vergrößert;", "2707": "Denn es bewirkt, daß die Samen zumal, woraus es bestehet, Gleichsam nach einem Ziele geradhin werden getrieben, Alle zusammen sich drängen und wirbeln im nämlichen Laufe.", "2708": "Möglich ist auch, daß der Blitz aus der Luft noch verschiedene Dinge Anzieht, die durch den Trieb noch die eigne Geschwindigkeit steigern.", "2709": "Sonder Gefährd' und Schaden auch trifft und durchdringet er viele Dinge, dieweil sein flüssiges Feuer die Poren hindurchschlüpst.", "2710": "Viele zerschmettert er auch, wenn selber die Stoffe des Blitzes Treffen auf Stoffe, wodurch das Gewebe der Dinge sich festhielt.", "2711": "Leicht macht ferner das Erz er schmelzen und setzet das Gold auch Plötzlich in Fluß, dieweil sein Wesen aus winzigen, glatten Urelementen besteht, die gar subtiler Natur sind;", "2712": "Mühsam dringen sie ein, und im Nu, sobald sie darin sind, Lösen sie alle Verknotungen aus und lockern die Bande.Meist in der Herbstzeit wird das mit glänzenden Sternen geschmückte Himmlische Haus und der Erdkreis rings svom Donners erschüttert, Ebenso, wann sich die Zeit ausschließet des blühenden Lenzes;", "2713": "Denn, da im Winter an Feuer es fehlt, im Sommer an Winden, Zeigen die Wolken sich da als von nicht so dichtem Bestände, Wenn nun die Himmelszeit in der Mitt' ist zwischen den beiden, Treffen die mancherlei Gründe, den Blitz zu erzeugen, zusammen.", "2714": "Denn es vermischet des Jahrs Scheidlinie Kälte mit Hitze, Deren der einen wie andern es braucht zum Schmieden des Blitzes, Daß Zwietracht

ist die Zeit, der gewöhnlich den Namen des Herbstes man beilegt, Und auf's Neue bekämpfen sich Sommer und eisiger Winter;", "2718": "Deßhalb kann man des Jahrs kriegführende Zeiten sie nennen.", "2719": "Auch ist's nicht zum Verwundern, daß bei dem Wechsel so häufig Blitz sich erzeugt und finstre Gewitter am Himmel heraufziehn, Weil ja von jeglicher Seite der Krieg, unentschieden noch, hertobt, Hier mit Flammen und dorten mit Wind, der mit Regen gemischt ist.Das nun heißt man das Wesen des Feuer enthaltenden Blitzes Klar durchschauen und, wie und wodurch er wirke, begreifen;", "2720": "Daß Tyrrhenergesänge wir zwecklos nimmer entrollen, Um die unserem Sinne verborgene göttliche Deutung Draus zu erschaun:", "2721": "wo der Blitz herflog und wohin er sich wandte, Wie es geschah, daß solcher durch rings umschlossene Räume Eindrang und, sich als Herr zu bethätigen, wieder emporsuhr, Oder was sonst noch der Strahl vom Himmel zu schaden vermöge.Ist's, daß Jupiter selbst und andere Götter des Himmels Leuchtende Tempel erschüttern mit Schrecken erregendem Donner Und ausschleudern das Feuer, wohin Jedwedem beliebet:", "2722": "Weßhalb machen sie nicht, daß der, der ohne Bedenken Jedes Verbrechen begeht, aushauche die flammenden Blitze Aus durchbohreter Brust, zum schreckenden Zeichen den Menschen?", "2723": "Weßhalb muß vielmehr, wer sich keinerlei Schande bewußt ist, Immer in Unschuld lebte, verstrickt sich wälzen in Flammen, Plötzlich erfaßt vom Wirbel des feurigen, himmlischen Blitzstrahls?", "2724": "Weßhalb schleudern umsonst sie den Blitz an verödete Plätze?", "2725": "Lediglich nur, um die Arme zu üben, die Schultern zu stärken?", "2726": "Lassen den donnernden Keil mit Selbstzustimmung des Vaters Sich aus der Erd' abstumpfen, anstatt für den Feind ihn zu sparen?", "2727": "Endlich, warum wirft nie aus heiterem Himmel den Blitzstrahl Jupiter nieder zur Erd' und schüttet des Donners Gebrüll aus?", "2728": "Steiget er wohl erst dann, wann die Wolken sich untergezogen, In das Gewoge hinab, um näher dem Ziele zu rücken?", "2729": "Weßhalb schleudert in's Meer er den Blitz?", "2730": "Was thaten die Wellen, Was ihm die flüssige Masse zu Leid und die schwimmenden Felder?Ist's sein Wille jedoch, daß dem zuckenden Strahl wir entgehen, Weßhalb zögert er, ihn noch im Lauf uns sehen zu lassen?", "2731": "Will ungeahnet dagegen er uns mit dem Feuer zerschmettern:", "2732": "Weßhalb donnert von dort er, da hier wir hüten uns könnten?", "2733": "Weßhalb regt er zuvor Nacht auf und Gebraus und Gemurmel?Und dann, kannst du begreifen, wie stets er an mehreren Orten Blitzet zugleich?", "2734": "Läßt die Thatsache sich etwa verläugnen, Daß zu der nämlichen Zeit verschiedene Schläge geschehen?", "2735": "Gar oft aber geschieht's und muß nothwendig geschehen, Daß, wie zur nämlichen Zeit an mehreren Orten es regnet, So auch zur nämlichen Zeit an mehreren Orten der Blitz fällt.Endlich, warum zerschmettert er heilige Tempel der Götter, Selbst ja den eigenen, herrlichen Sitz mit dem feindlichen Blitzstrahl?", "2736": "Bricht kunstreiche Gebilde der Götter entzwei und beraubet Sein selbsteigenes Bild durch arge Verletzung der Ehre?", "2737": "Weßhalb zielet er meist nach erhabenen Orten?", "2738": "Erblickt man Irgendwo so viel Spuren des Feuers, als auf den Gebirgshöhn?Uebrigens läßt aus diesen Erscheinungen leicht sich erklären, Wie sich, was nach der Sache den „Prester\" nannten die Gräser, Bildet und wie in das Meer von oben herab er sich senket.", "2739": "Denn bisweilen geschieht's, daß solche vom Himmel in's Meer sich Lassen herab, in Gestalt einer hängenden Saule, daß ringsum Kochet der Sand, von den stark herbrausenden Stürmen erreget;", "2740": "Und ist ergriffen ein Schiff von diesem gewaltigen Aufruhr, Wird es geschleudert umher und geräth in die höchste Bedrängniß.", "2741": "Dieses geschieht, wenn des Windes Gewalt die ergriffene Wolke Manchmal nicht zu durchbrechen im Stand ist, sondern herab sie Drückt,

Wolke zerrissen, so stürzet der Wind mit Gewalt sich Ueber das Meer und erregt in den Fluthen ein seltsames Kochen.", "2744": "Nämlich er fährt abwärts, im Wirbel sich drehend, und nimmt dann Mit sich hinunter die Wolke mit ihrem gedehneten Körper.", "2745": "Hat er hinab zur Fläche des Meeres die schwangre gedrückt nun, Stürzt urplötzlich er sich in die Wogen hinein und erreget Rings mit gewaltigem Brausen das Meer und zwingt es zu kochen.", "2746": "Auch kann's wohl sich ereignen, daß solch ein wirbelnder Windstoß Sich in die Wolken verwickelt, indem er wolkige Stoffe Rafft aus der Luft, und hinab vom Himmel sich neigt, wie der Prester.", "2747": "Ist nunmehr er zur Erde gelangt, und löst sich die Wolke, Stößt er gewaltige Wirbel hervor und stürmet sie von sich.", "2748": "Seltener aber geschieht auf dem Festland solches, wo Berge Sich in den Weg ihm stellen;", "2749": "es zeigt sich diese Erscheinung Oefter aus offener See, wo weiter der Himmel sich aufthut.Wolken entstehn alsdann, wann rauhere Körper in Menge, Die am oberen Raum Umschweifen des Himmels, zusammen Plötzlich sich thun und, wenn auch nur in loser Verbindung Einer verhängt in den andern, zusammengedrückt sich erhalten.", "2750": "Anfangs bilden sie nur zu kleineren Wolken sich aus, dann Fassen sie sich an einander und werden zu dichteren Haufen, Wachsen durch ihre Verbindung und werden gejagt von den Winden So lang, bis das Gewitter, das grausige, endlich erregt ist.Das auch geschieht, daß, je höher die Gipfel der Berge zum Himmel Ragen empor, sie um so viel mehr fortwährend auch rauchen, Dicht in die finstere Nacht blaßgelben Gewölkes gehüllet.", "2751": "Dieses erkläret sich so, weil, wenn sich die Wolken gebildet, Eh' noch das Auge vermag ihr dünnes Gewebe zu sehen, Zur höchstragenden Spitze des Bergs sie der tragende Wind drängt.", "2752": "Und so kommt es denn auch, daß, in größeren Haufen vereint, sie Dicht und gedrängt sich zeigen, zugleich vom Gipfel des BergeS Selber empor zu dem höheren Lustkreis scheinen zu steigen;", "2753": "Denn, daß der Wind vorzüglich die Höhn trifft, lehret die Sache Selbst, wie auch das Gefühl bei hoher Gebirge Besteigung.", "2754": "Uebrigens, daß die Natur empor von der Fläche des Meeres Körperchen treibet in Menge, bezeugen an's Ufer gehängte Kleidungsstücke, die ziehn an sich die verdunstete Feuchte.", "2755": "So kann diese denn auch aussteigen in größerer Masse", "2756": "Aus dem Gewoge der salzigen Fluth, zur Mehrung der Wolken, Weil in jeder Beziehung das Wesen der Feuchte sich gleich ist.Ferner bemerken wir oft, wie Nebel und dunstige Wärme Steigen zumal aus den Flüssen empor, ja selbst von der Erde, Die, wie ein Hauch aus denselben gepreßt, in die Höhe sich heben, Finstere Nacht am Himmel umher ausgießen und, wenn sie Sich allmälig vereinet, die oberen Wolken verstärken.", "2757": "Ebenso druckt von oben der Trieb des gestirneten Aethers, Und gleichsam sie verdichtend, verwebt er sein Blau in die Wolken.Möglich auch, daß mit diesem sich Körper von außen verbinden, Welche die Wolken erzeugen und schaffen die fliegenden Dünste.", "2758": "Denn, daß in nicht zu berechnender Zahl, in unendlicher Summe Dort in der Tiefe sie sind, das hab' ich gelehrt und gezeiget, Wie so beweglich die Körper sich zeigen im Flug, wie behende Durch unermeßliche Räume dahin sie pflegen zu schießen.",

und in Lage gebracht und in Ordnung, Wird von dem Uebrigen leicht auch der Grund entdecken sich lassen, Welcherlei Kraft die sei, die das mächtige Eisen heranzieht.Erstlich:", "2946": "eS müssen dem Stein viel Samen entweder entfließen, Oder ein Hauch, deß Schläge die Luft wegtreiben und trennen, Welche sich zwischen dem Stein und dem Eisen die Stätte gewählt hat.", "2947": "Ist der Raum nun

Rande deS Ringes Dünner geworden, der Raum entledigt und völlig geleert ist, Sogleich sämmtliche Luft, die hinter dem Ring sich befindet, Vorwärts treibt, als wäre vom Rücken hervor sie gestoßen.",

an, Den sie nun ganz natürlich von innen erregt und in gleicher Richtung treibet, wohin fie selber einmal sich gestürzt hat, Nämlich zum ledigen Raum, zu welchem ihr Streben sich wendet.Das auch geschieht, daß das Eisen nach seiner Natur sich von diesem Stein abwendet, ihn flieht und darauf ihm wiederum nachfolgt.Sah ich doch hüpfen sogar samothracische Ringe von Eisen, Eiserne Spähn' aufkochen und wallen in ehernen Schalen, Wann der magnetische Stein denselbigen untergelegt ward.", "2961": "So sehr scheint vor dem Stein das erregete Eisen zu fliehen Durch Zwietracht, die das Erz,

gemischt, so geschieht es, Daß des magnetischen Steins Strömung dasselbe zurückstößt.All die Dinge jedoch stehn nicht so fern von einander, Daß nicht viele dergleichen annoch anführen ich könnte, Die
