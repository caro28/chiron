decision to their instincts and habits as not to be talked over and impartial ?", "415": "Or is it a general charge against human in­ firmity that, having different opinions on the most necessary and important things, we seek in horses and dogs and birds how to marry and beget and rear children, as though we had no means of making our own nature known, and appeal to the habits and instincts of the brute creation, and call them in to bear witness against the many deviations from nature in onr lives, which from the first are confused and disorderly.", "416": "For among the brutes nature remains ever the same, pure and simple, but in men, owing to reason and habit, like oil in the hands of the perfumers, being mixed up with many added opinions, it becomes various and loses its original simplicity.", "417": "And let us not wonder that the brutes follow nature more closely than human beings, for in that respect even they are outstripped by inanimate things, which, being dowered neither with imagi­ nation nor any appetite or inclination contrary to nature, ever continue in the one path which nature has prescribed for them, as if they were tied and bound.", "418": "But in brutes the gentleness of mood inspired by reason, the subtlety, the love of freedom, are not qualities found in excess, but they have unreasonable appetites and desires, and act in a roundabout way

fashions of life, has left no plain or evident trace of nature.", "420": "1§ II.", "421": "Consider in their marriages how much the animals follow nature.", "422": "For they do not wait for any legislation about bachelor or late-married, like the citizens of Lycurgus and Solon, nor do they fear penalties for childlessness, nor are they anxious for the jus trium Uberorum,2 like many of the Romans, who only marry and have children for the privileges it bestows, not to have heirs, but to be qualified for succeeding themselves to inheritances.", "423": "Then, again, the male animal does not go with the female at all times;", "424": "for its aim is not pleasure but procreation:", "425": "so in the season of spring, the most appropriate time for such pairings,1 the female being submissive and tender attracts the male by her beautiful condition of body, coming as she does from the dew and fresh pastures, and when pregnant modestly retires and takes thought for the birth and safety of her offspring.", "426": "We cannot adequately describe all this, but every animal exhibits for its young affection and forethought and endurance and unselfishness.", "427": "We call the bee wise, and celebrate its \" making the yellow honey,\"2 flattering it for its tickling sweetness;", "428": "but we neglect the wisdom and in­ genuity of other creatures, both as regards the birth and

basket, and after deftly and closely weaving it together, subjects it to the action of the sea waves, that its surface may be rendered waterproof by this plash and cement, and it is hard for even iron or stone to break it.", "430": "And what is more wonderful still, so symmetrically is the entrance of the nest adjusted to the kingfisher's shape and size, that no beast either greater or smaller can enter it, they even say that it does not admit the sea, or even the very smallest things.", "431": "And cats, when they breed, very often let their kittens go out and feed, and take them back into their entrails again.", "432": "3", "433": "And the bear, a most savage and ugly beast, gives birth to its young without shape or joints, and with its tongue as with an instrument moulds its features, so that it seems to give form as well as life to its progeny.", "434": "And the lion in Homer, “ whom the hunters meet in the wood with its whelps, exulting in its strength, which so frowns that it hides its eyes,”4 does it not intend to bargain with the hunters for its whelps ?", "435": "For universally the love of animals for their offspring makes timid ones bold, and lazy ones energetic, and greedy ones unselfish.", "436": "And so the bird in Homer, feeding its young \" with its beak, with whatever it has captured, even though it goes ill with itself,”1 nourishes its young at the cost of its own hunger, and when the food is near its maw abstains from it, and holds it tightly in its mouth, that it may not gulp it down unawares.", "437": "\"And so a bitch be­ striding her tender pups,

their safety, themselves fly so near the sportsmen as to be almost caught, and then wheel round, and again fly back and make the sportsmen hope to catch them, till at last, having thus provided for the safety of their young, they lead the sports­ men on a long way.", "439": "As to hens, we see every day how they watch over their chicks, dropping their wings over some, and letting others climb on

stand their ground and fight valiantly.", "441": "Are we to suppose then that nature has only implanted these instincts in fowls and dogs and bears, anxious only about their offspring, to put us mortals out of countenance and to give us a bad name ?", "442": "considering these examples for us to follow, while disgrace justly attaches to our inhumanity, for mankind only is accused of having no disinterested affection, and of not knowing how to love except in regard to advantage.", "443": "For that line is greatly admired in the theatres, \" Man loves man only for reward,\" and is the view of Epicurus, who thinks that the father so loves his son, the mother her child, children their parents.", "444": "Whereas, if the brutes could understand conversation, and if anyone were to introduce horses and cows and dogs and birds into a common theatre,3 and were to change the sentiment into \" neither do dogs love their pups, nor horses their foals, nor birds their young, out of interest, but gratuitously and by nature,\" it would be recognized by the affections of all of them to be a true sentiment.", "445": "Why it would be disgraceful, great God, that birth and travail and procreation should be gratis and mere nature among the beasts, while among mankind they should be merely mercenary transactions!§ in.", "446": "But such a statement is not true or worthy of credit.", "447": "For as nature, in wild growths, such as wild vines, wild figs, or wild olives, makes the fruit imperfect and inferior to the fruit of cultivated trees, so has she given to the brutes an imperfect affection for their kind, one neither marked by justice nor going beyond commodity :", "448": "whereas to man, a logical and social animal, she has taught justice and law, and honour to the gods, and building of cities, and philanthropy, and has contributed the noble and goodly and fruitful seeds of all these in love to one's offspring, thereby following the very first elements that are found in the construction of the body.", "449": "For nature is everywhere perfect and artistic and complete, and, to borrow the ex­ pression of Erasistratus, has nothing tawdry about her:", "450": "but one

their languor and thinness of spirit floats about on the surface and oppresses them, has a safety-valve provided by nature in the menses, which relieve and cleanse the rest of the body, and fit the womb for conception in due season.", "453": "But after conception nature stops the menses, and arrests the flow of the blood, using it as aliment for the babe in the womb, until the time arrives for its birth, and it requires a different kind of food.", "454": "At this stage the blood is most ingeniously changed into a supply of milk, not diffused all over the body, but externally in the breasts,

all bounds, and, like some late-born and ill-begotten bastard brat, seeks to expel its legitimate brother the older love, the love of women.", "587": "For indeed, friend, it is only yesterday or the day before, since the strippings and exposures of the youths in the gymnasiums, that this boy-love crept in, and gently insinuated itself and got a footing, and at last in a little time got fully-fledged in the wrestling-schools, and has now got fairly unbearable, and insults and tramples on conjugal love, that love that gives immortality to our mortal race, when our nature has been extinguished by death, kindling it again by new births.", "588": "And this boy-love denies that pleasure is its aim :", "589": "for it is ashamed and afraid to confess the truth :", "590": "but it

Baccho was accustomed regularly to pass by her house on his way to the wrestling-school.", "664": "And as he passed by on this occasion with two or three of his companions, anointed for the exercise, Ismenodora met him at the door and just touched his cloak, and her friends rushed out all together and prettily seized the pretty fellow as he was in his cloak and jersey,2 and hurried him into the house and at once locked the doors.", "665": "And the women inside at once divested him of his cloak and put on him a bridal robe;", "666": "and the servants ran about the town and put olive wreaths and laurel garlands at the doors of Baccho's house as well as Ismenodora's, and a flute-girl went up and down the street playing and singing the wedding-song.", "667": "And some of the inhabitants of Thespiæand the strangers laughed, others were indignant and tried to make the superintendents of the gymnasium move in the matter, for they have great power in Thespiæ over the youths, and pay great attention to their actions.", "668": "And now there was no more talk about the sports, but everyone left the theatre for the neighbour­ hood of Ismenodora's house, and there stood in groups talking and disputing about what had happened.§", "669": "XI.", "670": "Now when Pisias' friend had come up like an aide­ de-camp in war, \" bloody with spurring, fiery red with haste,\" to report this news that Ismenodora had seized Baccho, my father said that Zeuxippus smiled, and being a great lover of Euripides repeated the line, \" Lady, though rich, thou hast thy sex's feelings.\"", "671": "But Pisias jumped up and cried out, \"Ye gods, what will be the end of license like this which will overthrow our town ?", "672": "Already we are fast tending to lawlessness through our independence.", "673": "And yet it is perhaps ridicu- Ions to be indignant about law and justice, when nature itself is trampled upon by being thus subjected to women ?", "674": "Saw even Lemnos ever the like of this ?", "675": "1 Let us go,\" he continued, \" let us go and hand over to the women the gymnasium and council-hall, if the townsmen have lost all their nerve.\"", "676": "Pisias then left the company, and Protogenes went with him, partly sympathizing with his indignation, but still endeavouring to cool him.", "677": "And Anthemion said, \" 'Twas a bold deed and certainly does savour somewhat of Lemnos—I own it now we are alone-this Ismenodora must be most violently in love.\"", "678": "Hereupon Soclarus said, with a sly smile, \" You don't think then that this rape and de­ tention was an excuse and stratagem on the part of a wily young man to escape from the clutches of his lovers, and fly of his own volition to the arms of a rich and handsome widow ? \" \"", "679": "Pray don't say so, Soclarus,\" said Anthemion, \" pray don't entertain any such suspicions of Baccho, for even if he were not by nature most simple and naive, he would not have concealed the matter from me to whom he divulges all his secrets, especially as he knows that I have always been very anxious he should marry Ismenodora.", "680": "But as Heraclitus says truly, It is more difficult to control love than anger;", "681": "for whatever love has a fancy to, it will buy even at the cost of life, money, and reputation.", "682": "Who lives a more quiet life in our town than Ismenodora ?", "683": "When did ever any ugly rumour attach itself to her ?", "684": "When did ever any breath of suspicion sully her house ?", "685": "Some divine inspiration, beyond human calculation, seems now to have possessed her.\"§ XII.", "686": "Then Pemptides laughed and said, \" Of course you know that there is a certain disease of the body called the sacred diseased", "687": "It is no wonder, therefore, if some call the greatest and most insane passion of the soul sacred and divine.", "688": "However, as in Egypt I once saw two neighbours disputing when a serpent passed by them on the road, both calling it a good omen, but each claiming the blessing as his alone ;", "689": "so seeing lately that some of you drag Love to the men's apartments, while others confine it to the women's side of the house, while all of you regard it as a divine and superlative blessing, I do not wonder, since it is a passion that has such power and honour, that those who ought to banish it from every quarter and clip its wings do them­ selves add to its influence and power.", "690": "And hitherto I held my peace, for I saw that the discussion turned rather on private than public interests, but now that we have got rid of Pisias, I would gladly hear from you to what they had an eye who first called Love a god.\"§ XIII.", "691": "Just as Pemptides had left off, and our father was about to answer his question, another messenger came from the town, sent by Ismenodora to summon Anthemion, for the tumult had increased, and there was a difference of opinion between the superintendents of the gymnasium, one thinking they ought to demand the liberation of Baccho, the other thinking they ought not to interfere.", "692": "Anthemion got up at once and went off.", "693": "And our father, addressing Pemp­ tides especially, said, \" You seem to me, my dear Pemptides, to be handling a great and bold matter, or rather to be discussing things that ought not to be discussed, in asking for a reason in each case for our opinion about the gods.", "694": "Our ancient and hereditary faith is sufficient, a better argument than which we cannot either utter or find, ' Not e'en if wisdom in our brains resides ;", "695": "'1 but if this common foundation and basis of all piety be dis­ turbed, and its stability and time-honoured ideas be un­ settled, it becomes undermined and is suspected by every­ body.", "696": "You have heard, of course, what hot water Euri­ pides got into, when he wrote at the beginning of his ' Melanippe,' ' Zeus, whosoe'er he is, I do not know Except by hearsay,'2 but if he changed the opening line, he had confidence, it seems, that his play would go down with the public un­ commonly well,' so he altered it into 'Zeus the divine, as he is truly called.' 2", "697": "And what difference is there between calling in question the received opinion about Zeus or Athene, and that about Love ?", "698": "For it is not now for the first time that Love asks for an altar and sacrifices, nor is he a strange god intro­ duced by foreign superstition, as some Attis or Adonis, far­ tively smuggled in by hermaphrodites and women, and secretly receiving honours not his own, to avoid an indict­ ment among the gods for coming among them under false pretences.", "699": "And when, my friend, you hear the words of Empedocles, ' Friendship is there too, of same length and breadth, But with the mind's eye only can you see it, Till with the sight your very soul is thralled,' you must suppose that they refer to Love.", "700": "For this god is in­ visible, but to be extolled by -as as one of the very oldest gods.", "701": "And if you demand proofs about everyone of the gods, laying a profane band on every temple, and bringing a learned doubt to every altar, you will scrutinize and pry into every­ thing.", "702": "But we need not go far to find Love's pedigree.", "703": "'", "704": "See you how great a goddess Aphrodite is ?", "705": "She 'tis that gave us and engendered Love, Whereof come all that on the earth do live.'3", "706": "And so Empedocles calls Aphrodite Life-giving,4 and Sophocles calls her Fruitful, both very appropriate epithets.", "707": "And though the wonderful act of generation belongs to Aphrodite only, and Love is only present in it as a subor­ dinate, yet if he be absent the whole affair becomes unde­ sirable, and low, and tame.", "708": "For a loveless coition brings only satiety, as the satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and has nothing noble resulting from it, whereas by Love Aphrodite removes the cloying element in pleasure, and produces harmonious friendship.", "709": "And so Parmenides de­ clares Love to be the oldest of the creations of Aphrodite, writing in his Cosmogony, 'Of all the gods first Love she did contrive.'", "710": "But Hesiod, more naturally in my opinion, makes Love the most ancient of all, so that all things derive their existence from him.", "711": "1", "712": "If we then deprive Love of his an­ cient honours, those of Aphrodite will be lost also.", "713": "For we cannot argue that, while some revile Love, all spare Aphro­ dite, for on the same stage we hear of Love, 'Love is an idle thing and for the idle :", "714": "'2 and again of Aphrodite, 'Cypris, my boys, is not her only name, For many names has she.", "715": "She is a hell, A power remorseless, nay a raging madness.\"", "716": "3", "717": "Just as in the case of the other gods there is hardly one that has not been reviled, or escaped the scurrility of ig­ norance.", "718": "Look, for example, at Ares, who may be con­ sidered as it were the counterpart of Love, what honours he has received from men, and again what abuse, as 'Ares is blind, ye women, has no eyes, And with his pig's snout roots up all good things,'4.", "719": "And Homer calls him 'blood-stained' and 'fickle.'5", "720": "And Chrysippus brings a grievous charge against him, in defining his name to mean destroyer,6 thereby giving a handle to those who think that Ares is only the fighting, wrangling, and quarrelsome instinct among mankind.", "721": "Others again will tell us that Aphrodite is simply desire, and Hermes eloquence, and the Muses the arts and sciences, and Athene wisdom.", "722": "You see what an abyss of impiety opens up before us, if we describe each of the gods, as only a passion, a power, or a virtue !", "723": "\"§ XIV. \" I see it,\" said Pemptides, \" and it is impious either to make the gods passions, or to do just the con- trait, and make the passions gods.\" \" What then ? \" said my father, \" do you consider", "724": "Ares a god, or only a human passion ? \"", "725": "And Pemptides, answering that he looked on Ares as god of the passionate and manly element in man­ kind, \" What,\" cried my father, \" shall the passionate and warlike and antagonistic instincts in man have a god, but the affectionate and social and clubable have none ?", "726": "Shall Ares, under his names of Enyalius and Stratius, pre­ side over arms and war and sieges and sacks of cities, and shall there be no god to witness and preside over, to direct and guide, conjugal affection, that friendship of closest union and communion ?", "727": "Why even those who hunt gazelles and hares and deer have a silvan deity who harks and halloos them on, for to Aristæus1 they pay their vows when in pitfalls and snares they trap wolves and bears, ' For Aristæus first set traps for animals.'", "728": "And Hercules invoked another god, when he was about to shoot at the bird, as the line of Æschylus shows, ' Hunter Apollo, make my bolt go straight!' 2", "729": "And shall no god or good genius assist and prosper the man who hunts in the best chase of all, the chase of friend­ ship ?", "730": "For I cannot for my part, my dear Daphnæus, consider man a less beautiful or important plant than the oak, or sacred olive, or the vine which Homer glorifies,3 seeing that man too has his growth and glorious prime alike of soul and body.\"§ xv.", "731": "Then said Daphnæus, \" In the name of the gods, who thinks differently ? \" \"", "732": "All those certainly must,\" answered my father, \" who think that the gods care only about ploughing and planting and sowing.", "733": "Have they not Nymphs attending upon them, called Dryads, ' whose age is coeval with the trees they live in :", "734": "and Dionysus the mirth-giving does he not increase the yield of the trees, the sacred splendour of Autumn,' as Pindar says ? 4", "735": "And if they care about all this, is there no god or genius who is interested in the nurture and growth of boys and youths in all their glorious flower ?", "736": "is there no one that cares that the growing man may be upright and virtuous, and that the nobility of his nature may not be warped and corrupted, either through want of a guardian or by the depravity of those he associates with?", "737": "Is it not monstrous and thankless to say so, seeing that we enjoy the divine bounty, which is dealt out to us richly, and never abandons us in our straits?", "738": "And yet some of these same straits have more necessity than beauty.", "739": "For example, our birth, in spite of the unpleasant circumstances attending it, is witnessed by the divine Ilithyia and Artemis :", "740": "and it would be better not to be born at all than to become bad through want of a good guardian and guide.", "741": "Moreover in sickness the god who is over that province does not desert us, nor even in death :", "742": "for even then there is a conductor and guide for the de­ parted, to lay them to sleep, and convey their souls to Hades,1 as the poet says, ' Night bore me not to be lord of the lyre, Nor to be seer, or healer of diseases, But to conduct the souls of the departed.'", "743": "And yet these duties involve much unpleasantness, whereas we cannot mention a holier work, nor any struggle or con­ test more fitting for a god to attend and play the umpire in, than the guidance of the young and beautiful in the prose­ cution of their love-affairs.", "744": "For there is here nothing of an unpleasant nature, no compulsion of any kind, but persua­ sion and grace, truly making toil sweet and labour delight­ ful, lead the way to virtue and friendship, and do not arrive at that desired goal without the deity, for they have as their leader and lord no other god than Love, the com­ panion of the Muses and Graces and Aphrodite.", "745": "For Love 4 sowing in the heart of man the sweet harvest of desire,' to borrow the language of Melanippides, mixes the sweetest and most beautiful things together.", "746": "But per­ haps you are of a different opinion, Zeuxippus.\"§ xvi. \" Not I, by Zeus,\" replied Zeuxippus. \"", "747": "To have a different opinion would be ridiculous.\" \" Then,\" con­ tinued my father, \" is it not also ridiculous, if there are four kinds of friendship, for so the ancients distinguished, the natural first, the second that to one's kindred, the third that to one's companions, the fourth the friendship of love, and each of the.", "748": "first three have a god as patron, either a god of friendship, or a god of hospitality, or a god of the family, or a god of the race,1 whereas the friendship of love only, as something altogether unholy, is left without any patron god, and that, too, when it needs most of all atten­ tive direction ? \"", "749": "\"It is,\" said Zeuxippus, \" highly ridicu­ lous.\"", "750": "My father continued, \" The language of Plato is very suggestive here, to make a slight digression.", "751": "One kind of madness (he says) is conveyed to the soul from the body through certain bad temperaments or mixtures, or through the prevalence of some noxious spirit, and is harsh, difficult to cure, and baneful.", "752": "Another kind of madness is not un­ inspired or from within, but an afflatus from without, a deviation from sober reason, originated and set in motion by some higher power, the ordinary characteristic of which is called enthusiasm.", "753": "For, as one full of breath is called ἔμπνοος, and as one full of sense is called so the name enthusiasm is given to the commotion of the soul caused by some Divine agency.", "754": "2", "755": "Thus there is the pro­ phetic enthusiasm which proceeds from Apollo, and the Bacchic enthusiasm which comes from Dionysus, to which Sophocles alludes where he says, ' Dance with the Corybantes;", "756": "' for the rites of Cybele and Pan have great affinities to the orgies of Bacchus.", "757": "And the third madness proceeds from the Muses, and possesses an impressionable and pure soul, and stirs up the poetry and music in a man.", "758": "As to the martial and warlike madness, it is well known from what god it proceeds, namely, Ares, 'kindling tear­ ful war, that puts an end to the dance and the song, and exciting civic strife.'3", "759": "There remains, Daphnæus, one more kind of madness in man, neither obscure nor tranquil, as to which I should like to ask Pemptides here, -' What god it is that shakes the fruitful thyrsus ?'", "760": "I refer to that love-fury for modest boys and chaste women, which is far the keenest and fiercest passion of all.", "761": "For have you not observed how the soldier, when he lays aside his arms, ceases from his warlike fury, as the poet says, ' Then from him Right gladly did his squires remove the armoury and sits down a peaceful spectator of others ?", "762": "2", "763": "The Bacchic and Cory ban tic dances one can also modulate and quell, by changing the metre from the trochaic and the measure from the Phrygian.", "764": "Similarly, too, the Pythian priestess, when she descends from her tripod, possesses her soul in peace.", "765": "Whereas the love-fury, when once it has really seized on a man and inflamed him, can be laid by no Muse, no charm or incantation, no change of place ;", "766": "but present they burn, absent they desire, by day they follow their loves about, by night they serenade them, sober call for them, and drunken sing about them.", "767": "And he who said that poetic fancies, owing to their vividness, were dreams of people awake, would have more truly spoken so of the fancies of lovers, who, as if their loves were present, converse with them, greet them, chide them.", "768": "For sight seems to paint all other fancies on a wet ground, so soon do they fade and recede from the memory, but the images of lovers, painted by the fancy as it were on encaustic tiles, leave impressions on the memory, that move, and live, and speak, and are permanent for all time.", "769": "The Roman Cato, indeed, said that the soul of the lover resided in the soul of the loved one, and I should extend the remark to the appearance, the character, the life, and the actions, conducted by which he travels a long journey in a short time, as the Cynics say they have found a short cut and, as it were, forced march to virtue, for there is also a short cut to friendship and love when the god is propitious.", "770": "To sum up, the enthusiasm of lovers is not a thing uninspired, and the god that guides and governs it is none other than the god whose festival we are now keeping, and to whom we are now sacrificing.", "771": "Nevertheless, as we judge of a god mainly from his power and usefulness (as among human advantages we reckon and call these two the most divine, dominion and virtue), it is high time to consider, before we proceed any further, whether Love yields to any of the gods in power.", "772": "Certainly, as Sophocles says, ' Wonderful is the power which the Cyprian Queen exerts so as always to win the victory:", "773": "'1 great also is the might of Ares;", "774": "and in some sort we see the power of all the other gods divided among these two;", "775": "for Aphrodite has most intimate con­ nection with the beautiful, and Ares is in our souls from the first to combat against the sordid, to borrow the idea of Plato.", "776": "Let us consider, then, to begin with, that the venereal delight can be purchased for six obols, and that no one ever yet put himself into any trouble or danger about it, unless he was in love.", "777": "And not to mention here such famous courtesans as Phryne or Lais, Gnathænium,' kind­ ling her lamp at evening time,' on the look-out for lovers and inviting them, is often passed by;", "778": "'yet, if some sud­ den whiff arise ' of mighty love and desire, it makes this very delight seem equal to the fabled wealth of Tantalus and his domains.", "779": "So feeble and cloying is the venereal indulgence, if Love inspires it not.", "780": "And you will see this more plainly still from the following consideration.", "781": "Many have allowed others to share in their venereal enjoyments, prostituting not only their mistresses but their wives, like that Roman Galba, who used to ask Mæcenas to dinner, and when he saw from his nods and winks that he had a mind to do with his wife, turned his head gently aside as if asleep;", "782": "but when one of his slaves came up to the table and stole some wine, his eyes were wide open enough, and he said, ' Villain, don't you know that I am asleep only for Maecenas ?

that city, Phayllus thought if he prostituted his wife, who was very handsome, to the King, he would get from him some important office or place.", "786": "And Nicos­ tratus getting wind of this, and walking about the doors of Phayllus' house with some of his servants on the qui vive, Phayllus made his wife put on men's boots, and a military cloak, and a Macedonian broad-brimmed bat, and so smug­ gled her into the King, without being detected, as one of the King's young men.", "787": "But, of all the multitude of lovers, did you ever hear of one that prostituted his boy-love even for the honours of Zeus ?", "788": "I think not.", "789": "Why, though no one will generally either speak or act against tyrants, many will who find them their rivals and are jealous about their handsome minions.", "790": "You must have heard how Aristogiton of Athens, and Antileon of Metapontum, and Melanippus of Agrigentum, rose not against tyrants, although they saw how badly they managed affairs, and what drunken tricks they played, yet, when they attempted the chastity of their boy-loves, they retaliated on them, jeoparding their lives, as if they were defending the inviola­ bility of temples and sanctuaries.", "791": "It is also recorded that Alexander wrote to Theodorus, the brother of Proteas, ' Send me your singing-girl, unless you love her yourself, and I will give you ten talents;",

excels in warlike feats, and is by no means idle, as Euripides called him,1 nor a carpet-knight, nor 'sleeping on a maiden's soft cheeks.'2", "796": "For a man inspired by Love needs not Ares to help him when he goes out as a warrior against the enemy, but at the bidding of his own god is ' ready' for his friend ' to go through fire and water and whirlwinds.'", "797": "And in Sophocles' play,3 when the sons of Niobe are being shot at and dying, one of them calls out for no helper or assister but his lover.", "798": "And you know of course how it was that Cleomachus the Pharsalian fell in battle ? \" \" We cer- tainly don't,\" said Pemptides and those near him, \" but we should very much like to.\"", "799": "\" Well,\" said my father, \" the tale's worth hearing.", "800": "When the war between the Eretrians and Chalcidians was at its height, Cleomachus had come to aid the latter with a Thessalian force;", "801": "and the Chalcidian infantry seemed strong enough, but they had great diffi­ culty in repelling the enemy's cavalry.", "802": "So they begged that high-souled hero Cleomachus to charge the Eretrian cavalry first.", "803": "And he asked his boy-love, who was by, if he would be a spectator of the fight, and he saying he would, and affectionately kissing him and putting his helmet on his head, Cleomachus with a proud joy put himself at the head of the bravest of the Thessalians, and charged the enemy's cavalry with such impetuosity that he threw them into disorder and routed them;", "804": "and the Eretrian infantry also fleeing in consequence, the Chalcidians won a splendid victory.", "805": "However, Cleomachus got killed, and they show his tomb in the market-place at Chalets, over which a huge pillar stands to this day, and whereas before that the people of Chalcis had censured boy-loves, from that time forward they preferred that kind of love to the normal love.", "806": "Aristotle gives a slightly different account, namely, that this Cleomachus came not from Thessaly, but from Chalcis in Thrace, to the help of the Chalcidians in Eubcea;", "807": "and that that was the origin of the song in vogue among the Chalcidians, 'Ye boys, who come of noble sires and beauteous are in face, Grudge not to give to valiant men the joy of your embrace :", "808": "For Love that does the limbs relax combined with bravery", "809": "In the Chalcidian cities has fame that ne'er shall die.'", "810": "But according to the account of the poet Dionysius, in his ' Causes,'1 the name of the lover was Anton, and that of the boy-love was PhiHstus.", "811": "And among you Thebans, Pemp­ tides, is it not usual for the lover to give his boy-love a com­ plete suit of armour when he is enrolled among the men ?", "812": "And did not the erotic Pammenes change the disposition of the heavy-armed infantry, censuring Homer as knowing nothing about love, because he drew up the Achaeans in order of battle in tribes and clans, and did not put lover and love together, that so ' Spear should be next to spear, helmet to helmet,'1 seeing that Love is the only invincible general.", "813": "2", "814": "For men in battle will leave in the lurch clansmen and friends, aye,

formidable and a source of terror to the enemy, Eucnamus of Amphissa, who first stood up against him and smote him, received hero honours from the Phocians for his exploit.", "820": "And as to all the loves of Hercules, it would take up too much time to enumerate them, but those who think that Iolaus was one of them do up to this day worship and honour him, and make their loves swear fidelity at his tomb.", "821": "Hercules is also said, having understood the art of healing, to have preserved the life of Alcestis, when she was given up by the doctors, to gratify Admetus, who passionately loved his wife, and was Hercules' minion.", "822": "They say also in legend that Apollo was enamoured of Admetus, ' And was his hired slave for one long year.'", "823": "It was a happy thought our remembering Alcestis, for though women have not much of Ares in them, yet when possessed by Love they are bold even to the death, beyond what one would expect from their nature.", "824": "For if we may credit legendary lore, the stories about Alcestis, and Protesilaus, and Eurydice the wife of Orpheus, show that the only one of the gods that Hades pays attention to is Love ;", "825": "although

lore speaks well, and by a certain wonderful good fortune lights upon the truth, in saying that lovers have a return from Hades to the light of day, but it knows not by what way or how, having as it were got benighted on the road which Plato first discovered by philosophy.", "829": "There are, indeed, some slender and obscure particles of truth scattered about in the mythology of the Egyptians, but they require a clever man to hunt them out, a man capable of getting great results from small data.", "830": "Wherefore let that matter pass.", "831": "And now next to the mighty power of Love let us consider its good will and favour to mankind, I do not mean as to whether it bestows many gifts on its votaries­ that is palpable to all-but whether they derive any fur­ ther advantage from it.",

Love also makes peevish and gloomy persons kind and agreeable to those they live with ;", "838": "for as ‛when the fire blazes the house looks brighter,'2 so man, it seems, becomes more cheerful through the beat of love.", "839": "But most people are affected rather curiously;", "840": "if they see by night a light in a house, they look on it with admiration and wonder ;", "841": "but if they see a little, mean, and ignoble soul suddenly filled with noble-mindedness, freedom, dignity, grace, and liberality, they do not feel constrained to say with Telemachus,' Surely, some god is there within.’3", "842": "And is it not wonderful, Daphnæus,” continued my father,' \" in the name of the Graces, that the lover who cares about hardly anything, either his companions and friends, or even the laws and magistrates and kings, who fears nothing, admires nothing, courts nothing, but can even endure to gaze on ‛the forked lightnjng,’5 yet directly he looks on his love he crouches like a cock with drooping feathers,' and his boldness is broken and his pride is cowed.", "843": "And among the Muses it would not be amiss to mention Sappho ;", "844": "for as the Romans say Cacus the son of Hephæstus vomited out of his mouth fire and flames, so she really speaks words that burn like fire, and in her songs shows the warmth of her heart, as Philoxenus puts it, 4 by euphonious songs assuag­ ing the pains of love.'", "845": "And if you have not in your love for Lysandra forgot all your old love-songs, do repeat to us, Daphnæus, the lines in which beautiful Sappho says that 4 when her love appeared her voice failed and her body burned, and she was seized with paleness and trembling and vertigo.' \"", "846": "And when Daphnæus had repeated the lines, my father resumed, “In the name of Zeus, is not this plainly a divine seizure P Is not this a wonderful com­ motion of soul ?", "847": "Why, the Pythian priestess on the tripod is not moved so much as this !", "848": "Who of those inspired by Cybele are made beside themselves to this extent by the flute and the kettledrum ?", "849": "Moreover, while many see the same body and the same beauty, only the lover is taken by it.", "850": "Why is this the case?", "851": "We get no light on it from Menander's words, ‘Love is opportunity;", "852": "and he that is smitten is the only one wounded.'", "853": "But the god is the cause of it, striking one and letting another go scot-free.", "854": "But I will not pass over now, 4 since it has come into my mouth,' as Æschylus says, what perhaps would have been better spoken before, for it is a very important point.", "855": "Perhaps, my friend, of all other things which we do not perceive through the senses, some got believed through legend, some through the law, some through reason ;", "856": "whereas we owe our conception of the gods altogether to the poets and legislators and philosophers:", "857": "all alike teach­ ing the existence of gods, but greatly differing as to their number and order, nature and power.", "858": "For the gods of the philosophers ‘know nothing of disease or old age or pain, and have not to cross the resounding Acheron;", "859": "' nor do the philosophers accept as gods Strifes, or Prayers, which are found in poetry;", "860": "1 nor will they admit Terror and Fear as gods or as the sons of Ares.", "861": "And on many points also they are at variance with the legislators, as Xenophanes bade the Egyptians, if they regarded Osiris as mortal, not to honour him as a god ;", "862": "but if they thought him a god not to mourn for him.", "863": "And, again, the poets and legislators will not listen to, nor can they understand, the philosophers who make gods of ideas and numbers and units and spirits.", "864": "And their views generally are very different.", "865": "As there were formerly three parties at Athens, the Parali, the Epacrii, and the Pediei, all at variance with one another, yet all agreed to vote for Solon, and chose him with one accord as their mediator and ruler and lawgiver, as he seemed indis­ putably to hold the first place in merit;", "866": "so the three parties that entertain different views about the gods are all unani­ mous on one point, for poets legislators and philosophers all alike register Love as one of the gods, loudly singing his praises with one voice,' as Alcæus says the people of Mitylene chose Pittacus as their monarch.", "867": "But our king and ruler and governor, Love, is brought down crowned from Helicon to the Academy by Hesiod and Plato and Solon, and in royal apparel rides in a chariot drawn by friendship and intimacy (not such as Euripides speaks of in the line, 'he has been bound in fetters not of brass,’1 shamefully throwing round him cold and heavy necessity), and soars aloft to the most beautiful and divine things, about which others have spoken better than I can.\"§ xix.", "868": "When my father had spoken thus much, Soclarus began, \" Do you see that a second time you have committed the same fault, not cancelling your debts as you ought to do -for I must speak my mind-but evading them on purpose, and not delivering to us your promised ideas on a sacred subject ?", "869": "For as some little time back you only just touched on Plato and the Egyptians as if unwilling to enter on the subject more fully, so now you are doing again.", "870": "However, as to what has been 1 eloquently told '2 by Plato, or rather by the Muses through Plato's mouth, do not tell us that, my good friend, even if we ask for it;", "871": "but as to your hint that the Egyptian legend about Love corre­ sponded with Plato's views, you need not discuss it fully and minutely, we shall be satisfied if we hear a little of such mighty matters.\"", "872": "And as the rest of the company made the same request, my father said, “The Egyptians, (like the Greeks) recognize two Loves, the Pandemian and the Celestial, to which they add the Sun, they also highly venerate Aphrodite.", "873": "We also see much similarity between Love and the Sun, for neither is a fire, as some think, but a sweet and productive radiance and warmth, the Sun bringing to the body nourishment and light and growth, and Love doing the same to the soul.", "874": "And as the heat of the Sun is more powerful when it emerges from clouds and after mist, so Love is sweeter and hotter after a jealous tiff with the loved one,1 and moreover, as some think the Sun is kindled and extinguished, so also do people conceive of Love as mortal and uncertain.", "875": "Moreover, just as without training the body cannot easily bear the heat of the Sun, so neither can the untrained soul easily bear the yoke of Love, but both are equally out of tune and suffer, for which they blame the deity and not their own weakness.", "876": "But in this respect they seem to differ, in that the Sun exhibits to the eye things beautiful and ugly alike, whereas Love throws its light only on beautiful things, and persuades lovers to concentrate their attention on these, and to neglect all other things.", "877": "As to those that call Aphrodite the Moon, they, too, find some points in common between them;", "878": "for the Moon is divine and heavenly and a sort of halfway­ house between mortal and immortal, but inactive in itself and dark without the presence of the Sun, as is the case with Aphrodite in the absence of Love.", "879": "So we may say that Aphrodite resembles the Moon, and Love the Sun, more than any other deities, yet are not Love and the Sun altogether the same, for just as body and soul are not the same, but something different, so is it with the Sun and Love, the former can be seen, the latter only felt.", "880": "And if it should not seem too harsh a saying, one might argue that the Sun acts entirely opposite to Love, for it turns the mind away from the world of fancy to the world of reality, beguiling us by its grace and splendid appearance, and persuading us to seek for truth and everything else in and round it and nowhere else.", "881": "For as Euripides says, ‘Too passionately do we love the Sun, Because it always shines upon the earth, From inexperience of another life,’1 or rather from forgetfulness of those things which Love brings to our remembrance.", "882": "For as when we are woke by a great and bright light, everything that the soul has seen in dreams is vanished and fled, so the Sun is wont to banish the remembrance of past changes and chances, and to be­ witch the intelligence, pleasure and admiration causing this forgetfulness.", "883": "And though reality is really there, yet the soul cleaves to dreams and is dazzled by what is most beautiful and divine.", "884": "‘For round the soul are poured sweet yet deceiving dreams,' so th it the soul thinks every­ thing here good and valuable, unless it obtain divine and chaste Love as its physician and preserver.", "885": "For Love brings the soul through the body to truth and the region of truth, where pure and guileless beauty is to be found, kindly befriending its votaries like an initiator at the mysteries.", "886": "And it associates with the soul only through the body.", "887": "And as geometricians, in the case of boys who can­ not yet be initiated into the perception of incorporeal and impassive substance, convey their ideas through the medium of spheres, cubes, and dodecahedrons, so celestial Love has contrived beautiful mirrors of beautiful things, and ex­ hibits them to us glittering in the shapes colours and appearances of youths in all their flower, and calmly stirs the memory which is inflamed first by these.", "888": "Consequently some, through the stupidity of their friends and intimates, who have endeavoured by force and against reason to ex­ tinguish the flame, have got no advantage from it, but filled themselves with smoke and confusion, or have rushed into secret and lawless pleasures and ingloriously wasted their prime.", "889": "But as many as by sober reason and modesty have abated the extravagance of the passion, and left in the soul only a bright glow-not exciting a tornado of pas­ sion, but a wonderful and productive diffusion, as in a growing plant, opening the pores of complaisance and friendliness—these in no long time cease to regard the per­ sonal charms of those they love, and study their inward characters, and gaze at one another with unveiled eyes, and associate with one another in words and actions, if they find in their minds any fragment or image of the beautiful;", "890": "and if not they bid them farewell and turn to others, like bees that only go to those flowers from which they can get honey.", "891": "But wherever they find any trace or emanation or pleasing resemblance of the divine, in an ecstasy of pleasure and delight they indulge their memory, and revive to whatever is truly lovely and felicitous and admired by everybody.\"§ xx.", "892": "“The poets indeed seem for the most part to have written and sung about Love in a playful and merry manner, but have sometimes spoken seriously about him, whether out of their own mind, or the god helping them to truth.", "893": "Among these are the lines about his birth, ‘Well-sandalled Iris bare the most powerful of the gods to golden-haired Zephyr.’1", "894": "But perhaps the learned have persuaded you that these lines are only a fanciful illustration of the variety and beauty of love.\" \" Certainly,\" said Daphnæus, “what else could they mean ? \" \" Hear me,\" said my father, \" for the heavenly phenomenon compels us so to speak.", "895": "The rainbow2 is, I suppose, a reflection caused by the sun's rays falling on a moist cloud, making us think the appearance is in the cloud.", "896": "Similarly erotic fancy in the case of noble souls causes a reflection of the memory, from things which here appear and are called beautiful, to what is really divine and lovely and felicitous and wonder­ ful.", "897": "But most lovers pursuing and groping after the semblance of beauty in boys and women, as in mirrors,3 can derive nothing more certain than pleasure mixed with pain.", "898": "And this seems the love-delirium of Ixion, who instead of the joy he desired embraced only a cloud, as children who desire to take the rainbow into their hands, clutching at whatever they see.", "899": "But different is the be- haviour of the noble and chaste lover:", "900": "for he reflects on the divine beauty that can only be felt, while he uses the beauty of the visible body only as an organ of the memory, though he embraces it and loves it, and associating with it is still more inflamed in mind.", "901": "And so neither in the body do they sit ever gazing at and desiring this light, nor after death do they return to this world again, and skulk and loiter about the doors and bedchambers of newly-married people, disagreeable ghosts of pleasure-loving and sensual men and women, who do not rightly deserve the name of lovers.", "902": "For the true lover, when he has got into the other world and associated with beauties as much as is lawful, has wings and is initiated and passes his time above in the presence of his Deity, dancing and waiting upon him, until he goes back to the meadows of the Moon and Aphrodite, and sleeping there commences a new existence.", "903": "But this is a subject too high for the present occasion.", "904": "However, it is with Love as with the other gods, to borrow the words of Euripides, ' he rejoices in being honoured by mankind,’1 and vice versa, for be is most propitious to those that receive him properly, but visits his displeasure on those that affront him.", "905": "For neither does Zeus as god of Hospi­ tality punish and avenge any outrages on strangers or sup­ pliants, nor as god of the family fulfil the curses of parents, as quickly as Love hearkens to lovers unfairly treated, being the chastiser of boorish and haughty persons.", "906": "Why need I mention the story of Euxynthetus and Leucomantis, the latter of whom is called The Peeping Girl to this day in Cyprus ?", "907": "But perhaps you have not heard of the punishment of the Cretan Gorge, a somewhat similar case to that of Leucomantis, except that she was turned into stone as she peeped out of window to see her lover carried out to burial.", "908": "For this Gorge had a lover called Asander, a proper young man and of a good family, but reduced in fortune, though he thought himself worthy to mate with anybody.", "909": "So he wooed Gorge, being a relation of hers, and though he bad many rivals, as she was much run after for her wealth belike, yet he had won the esteem of all the guardians and relations of the young girl.", "910": "2 * * * *§ xxi. * * *", "911": "Now the origins and causes of Love are not peculiar to either sex, but common to both.", "912": "For those attractions that make men amorous may as well proceed from women as from boys.", "913": "1", "914": "And as to those beautiful and holy reminiscences and invitations to the divine and genuine and Olympian beauty, by which the soul soars aloft, what hinders but that they may come either from boys or lads, maidens or grown women, whenever a chaste and orderly nature and beauteous prime are associated together (just as a neat shoe exhibits the shapeliness of the foot, to borrow the illustration of Aristo), whenever connoisseurs of beauty descry in beautiful forms and pure bodies clear traces of an upright and unenervated soul.", "915": "2", "916": "For if3 the man of pleasure, who was asked whether \" he was most given to the love of women or boys,\" and answered, \" I care not which so beauty be but there,\" is considered to have given an appropriate answer as to his erotic desires, shall the noble lover of beauty neglect beauty and nobility of nature, and make love only with an eye to the sexual parts ?", "917": "Why, the lover of horses will take just as much pleasure in the good points of Podargus, as in those of Æthe, Agamemnon's mare,4 and the sportsman rejoices not only in dogs, but also rears Cretan and Spartan bitches,5 and shall the lover of the beautiful and of humanity be unfair and deal unequally with either sex, and think that the difference between the loves of boys and women is only their different dress?", "918": "And yet they say that beauty is a flower of virtue5 and it is ridiculous to assert that the female sex never blossoms nor make a goodly show of virtue, for as AEschylus truly says, ‘I never can mistake the burning eye Of the young woman that has once known man.’8", "919": "Shall the indications then of a forward wanton and corrupt character be found in the faces of women, and shall there be no gleam of chastity and modesty in their appearance?", "920": "Nay, there are many such, and shall they not move and provoke love ?", "921": "To doubt it would be neither sensible nor in accordance with the facts, for generally speaking, as has been pointed out, all these attractions are the same in both sexes ...", "922": "But, Daphnæus, let us combat those views which Zeuxippus lately advanced, making Love to be only irregular desire carrying the soul away to licentiousness, not that this was so much his own view as what he had often beard from morose men who knew nothing of love :", "923": "some of whom marry unfortunate women for their dowries, and force on them economy and illiberal saving, and quarrel with them every day of their lives:", "924": "while others, more desirous of children than wives, when they have made those women they come across mothers, bid farewell to mar­ riage, or regard it not at all, and neither care to love nor be loved.", "925": "Now the fact that the word for conjugal lovo differs only by one letter from the word for endurance, the one being στέργειν the other στέγειν, seems to empha­ size the conjugal kindness mixed by time and intimacy with necessity.", "926": "But that marriage which Love has inspired will in the first place, as in Plato's Republic, know nothing of Meum and Tuum, for the proverb, 4 whatever belongs to a friend is common property,’1 is especially true of married persons who, though disunited in body, are perforce one in soul, neither wishing to be two, nor thinking themselves so.", "927": "In the second place there will be mutual respect, which is a vital necessity in marriage.", "928": "For as to that external respect which has in it more of compulsion than choice, being forced by the law and shame and fear, “Those needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,” 2 that will always exist in wedlock.", "929": "But in Love there is such self-control and decorum and constancy, that if the god but once enter the soul of a licentious man, he makes him give up all his amours, abates his pride, and breaks down his haughtiness and dissoluteness, putting in their place modesty and silence and tranquillity and decorum, and makes him constant to one.", "930": "You have heard of course of the famous courtesan Lais,1 how she set all Greece on fire with her charms, or rather was contended for by two seas,2 and how, when she fell in love with Hippolochus the Thessalian, ‘she left Acro-Corinthus washed by the green sea,’3 and deserted all her other lovers, that great army, and went off to Thessaly and lived faithful to Hippo­ lochus.", "931": "But the women there, envious and jealous of her for her surpassing beauty, dragged her into the temple of Aphrodite, and there stoned her to death, for which reason probably it is called to this day the temple of Aphrodite the Murderess.'", "932": "We have also heard of servant girls who have refused the embraces of their masters, and of private individuals who have scorned an amour with queens, when Love has had dominion in their hearts.", "933": "For as in Rome, when a dictator is proclaimed, all other magistrates lay down their offices, so those over whom Love is lord are free henceforward from all other lords and masters, and pass the rest of their lives dedicate to the god and slaves in his temple.", "934": "For a noble woman united by Love to her lawful husband would prefer the embraces of bears and dragons to those of any other man.\"§ XXII.", "935": "\"Although there are plenty of examples of this virtue of constancy, yet to you, that are the festive votaries of the god,5 it will not be amiss to relate the story of the Galatian Gamma.", "936": "She was a woman of most remarkable beauty, and the wife of the tetrarch Sinatus, whom Sinorix, one of the most influential men in Galatia, and desperately in love with Gamma, murdered, as he could neither get her by force or persuasion in the lifetime of her husband.", "937": "And Gamma found a refuge and comfort in her grief in discharging the functions of hereditary priestess to Artemis, and most of her time she spent in her temple, and, though many kings and potentates wooed her, she refused them all.", "938": "But when Sinorix boldly proposed marriage to her, she declined not his offer, nor blamed him for what he had done, as though she thought he had only murdered Sinatus out of excessive love for her, and not in sheer villany.", "939": "He came, therefore, with confidence, and asked her hand, and she met him and greeted him and led him to the altar of the goddess, and pledged him in a cup of poisoned mead, drinking half of it herself and giving him the rest.", "940": "And when she saw that he had drunk it up, she shouted aloud for joy, and calling upon the name of her dead husband, said, ' Till this day, dearest husband, I have lived, deprived of you, a life of sorrow:", "941": "but now take me to yourself with joy, for I have avenged you on the worst of men, as glad to share death with him as life with you.'", "942": "Then Sinorix was removed out of the temple on a litter, and soon after gave up the ghost, and Camma lived the rest of that day and following night, and is said to have died with a good courage and even with gaiety.", "943": "\"1§ XXIII.", "944": "\"As many similar examples might be adduced, both among ourselves and foreigners, who can feel any patience with those that reproach Aphrodite with hinder­ ing friendship when she associates herself with Love as a partner?", "945": "Whereas any reflecting person would call the love of boys wanton and gross lasciviousness, and say with the poet:", "946": "' This is an outrage, not an act of love.'", "947": "All willing pathics, therefore, we consider the vilest of man­ kind, and credit them with neither fidelity, nor modesty, nor friendship, for as Sophocles says:", "948": "‘Those who shall lose such friends may well be glad, And those who have such pray that they may lose them.", "949": "’2But as for those who, not being by nature vicious, have been seduced or forced, they are apt all their life to despise and hate their seducers, and when an opportunity has presented itself to take fierce vengeance.", "950": "As Crateus, who murdered Archelaus, and Pytholaus, who murdered Alexander of Pherme.", "951": "And Periander, the tyrant of the Ambraciotes, having asked a most insulting question of his minion, was murdered by him, so exasperated was he.", "952": "But with women and wives all this is the beginning of friendship, and as it were an initiation into the sacred mysteries.", "953": "And pleasure plays a very small part in this, but the esteem and favour and mutual love and constancy that result from it, proves that the Delphians did not talk nonsense in giving the name of Arma1 to Aphrodite, nor Homer in giving the name of friendship2 to sexual love, and testifies to the fact that Solon was a most experienced legislator in conjugal matters, seeing that he ordered husbands not less than thrice a month to associate with their wives, not for pleasure, but as states at certain intervals renew their treaties with one another, so he wished that by such friendliness marriage should, as it were, be renewed after any intervening tiffs and differences.", "954": "But you will tell me there is much folly and even madness in the love of women.", "955": "Is there not more extravagance in the love of boys ?", "956": "‘Seeing my many rivals I grow faint.", "957": "The lad is beardless, smooth and soft and handsome, O that I might in his embraces die, And have the fact recorded on my tomb.'", "958": "Such extravagant language as this is madness not love.", "959": "And it is absurd to detract from woman's various ex­ cellence.", "960": "Look at their self-restraint and intelligence, their fidelity and uprightness, and that bravery courage and magnanimity so conspicuous in many!", "961": "And to say that they have a natural aptitude for all other virtues, but are deficient as regards friendship alone, is monstrous.", "962": "For they are fond of their children and husbands, and generally speaking the natural affection in them is not only, like a fruitful soil, capable of friendship, but is also accompanied by persuasion and other graces.", "963": "And as poetry gives to words a kind of relish by melody and metre and rhythm, making instruction thereby more in­ teresting, but what is injurious more insidious, so nature, investing woman with beautiful appearance and attractive voice and bewitching figure, does much for a licentious woman in making her wiles more formidable, but makes a modest one more apt thereby to win the goodwill and friendship of her husband.", "964": "And as Plato advised Xeno­ crates, a great and noble man in all other respects, but too austere in his temperament, to sacrifice to the Graces, so one might recommend a good and modest woman to sacrifice to Love, that her husband might be a mild and agreeable partner, and not run after any other woman, so as to be compelled to say like the fellow in the comedy, ' What a wretch I am to ill-treat such a woman!'", "965": "For to love in marriage is far better than to be loved, for it prevents many, Day all, of those offences which spoil and mar marriage.", "966": "§ xxiv.", "967": "As to the passionate affection in the early days of marriage,1 my dear Zeuxippus, do not fear that it will leave any sore or irritation, though it is not wonderful that there should be some friction at the commencement of union with a virtuous woman, just as at the grafting of trees, as there is also pain at the beginning of conception, for there can be no complete union without some suffering.", "968": "Learning puts boys out somewhat when they first go to school, as philosophy does young men at a later day, but the ill effects are not lasting, either in their cases or in the case of lovers.", "969": "As in the fusion of two liquors, love does indeed at first cause a simmering and commotion, but eventually cools down and settles and becomes tranquil.", "970": "For the union of lovers is indeed a complete union, whereas the union of those that live together without love resembles only the friction and concussion of Epicurus' atoms in collision and recoil, forming no such union as Love makes, when he presides over the conjugal state.", "971": "For nothing else produces so much pleasure, or such lasting advantages, or such beautiful remarkable and desirable friendship, ' As when husband and wife live in one house, Two souls beating as one.’2", "972": "And the law gives its countenance, and nature shows that even the gods themselves require love for the production of everything.", "973": "Thus the poets tell as that ‘the earth loves a shower, and heaven loves the earth,' and the natural philosophers tell us that the sun is in love with the moon, and that they are husband and wife, and that the earth is the mother of man and beast and the producer of all plants.", "974": "Would not the world itself then of necessity come to an end, if the great god Love and the desires implanted by the god should leave matter, and matter should cease to yearn for and pursue its lead ?", "975": "But not to seem to wander too far away and altogether to trifle, you know that many censure boy-loves for their instability, and jeeringly say that that intimacy like an egg is destroyed by a hair,1 for that boy-lovers like Nomads, spending the summer in a blooming and flowery country, at once decamp then as from an enemy's territory.", "976": "And still more vulgarly Bion the Sophist called the sprouting beards of beautiful boys Harmodiuses and Aristogitons,2 inasmuch as lovers were delivered by them from a pleasant tyranny.", "977": "But this charge cannot justly be brought against genuine lovers, and it was prettily said by Euripides, as he embraced and kissed handsome Agatho whose beard was just sprout­ ing, that the Autumn of beautiful youths was lovely as well as the Spring.", "978": "And I maintain that the love of beautiful and chaste wives flourishes not only in old age amid grey hairs and wrinkles, but even in the grave and monument.", "979": "And while there are few such long unions in the case of boy-loves, one might enumerate ten thousand such instances of the love of women, who have kept their fidelity to the end of their lives.", "980": "One such case I will relate, which happened in my time in the reign of the Emperor Vespasian.", "981": "§ xxv. Julius, who stirred up a revolt in Galatia, among several other confederates had one Sabinus, a young man of good family, and for wealth and renown the most con­ spicuous of all the men in those parts.", "982": "But having attempted what was too much for them they were foiled, and expect­ ing to pay the penalty, some committed suicide, others fled and were captured.", "983": "Now Sabinus himself could easily have got out of the way and made his escape to the barbarians, but he had married a most excellent wife, whose name in that part of the world was Empone, but in Greek would be Herois, and he could neither leave her behind nor take her with him.", "984": "As he had in the country some underground caves, known only to two of his freedmen, where he used to stow away things, he dismissed all the rest of his slaves, as if he intended to poison himself, and taking with him these two trusty freedmen he descended with them into those underground caves, and sent one of them, Martialis, to tell his wife that he had poisoned himself, and that his body was burnt in the flames of his country-house, for he wanted his wife's genuine sorrow to lend credit to the report of his death.", "985": "And so it happened.", "986": "For she, throwing herself on to the ground, groaned and wailed for three days and nights, and took no food.", "987": "And Sabinus, being informed of this, and fearing that she would die of grief, told Martialis to inform her secretly that he was alive and well and in hiding, and to beg her not to relax her show of grief, but to keep up the farce.", "988": "And she did so with the genius of a professional actress, but yearning to see her husband she visited him by night, and returned without being noticed, and for six or seven months she lived with him this underground life.", "989": "And she disguised him by changing his dress, and cutting off his beard, and re-arranging his hair, so that he should not be known, and took him to Rome, having some hopes of obtaining his pardon.", "990": "But being unsuccessful in this she returned to her own country, and spent most of her time with her husband underground, but from time to time visited the town, and showed herself to some ladies who were her friends and relations.", "991": "But what is most astonishing of all is that, though she bathed with them, she concealed her pregnancy from them.", "992": "For the dye which women use to make their hair a golden auburn, has a tendency to produce corpulence and flesh and a full habit, and she rubbed this abundantly over all parts of her body, and so concealed her pregnancy.", "993": "And she bare the pangs of travail by herself, as a lioness bears her whelps, having hid herself in the cave with her husband, and there she gave birth to two boys, one of whom died in Egypt, the other, whose name was Sabinus, was among us only the other day at Delphi.", "994": "Vespasian eventually put her to death, but paid the penalty for it, his whole progeny in a short time being wiped off the face of the earthy", "995": "For during the whole of his reign he did no more savage act, nor could gods or demons have turned away their eyes from a crueller sight.", "996": "And yet her courage and bold language abated the pity of the spectators, though it exasperated Vespasian, for, despairing of her safety, she bade them go and tell the

these arising in the minds of women, for if they are not well informed by good pre­ cepts, and share in the teaching that men get, they generate among themselves many foolish and absurd ideas and states of mind.", "1224": "But do you, Eurydice, study to make yourself acquainted with the sayings of wise and good women, and ever have on your tongue those sentiments which as a girl you learnt with us, that so you may make your husband's heart glad, and be admired by all other women, being in yourself so wonderfully and splendidly adorned.", "1225": "For one cannot take or put on, except at great expense, the jewels of this or that rich woman, or the silk dresses of this or that foreign woman, but the virtues that adorned Theano,l and Cleobuline, and Gorge the wife of Leonidas, and Timoclea the sister of Theagenes, and the ancient Claudia,2 and Cornelia the sister of Scipio,3 and all other such noble and famous women, these one may array oneself in without money and without price, and so adorned lead a happy and famous life.", "1226": "For if Sappho plumed her­ self so much on the beauty of her lyrical poetry as to write to a certain rich woman, \" You shall lie down in your tomb, nor shall there be any remembrance of you, for you have no part in the roses of Pieria,\" how shall you not have a greater right to plume yourself on having a part not in the roses but in the fruits which the Muses bring, and which they freely bestow on those that admire learning and philo­ sophy ?", "1227": "4§ I.

grief too excessive, it would trouble me even more than the event itself.", "1235": "And yet I have not a heart hard as heart of oak or flintstone, as you yourself know very well, who have shared with me in the bringing up of so many children, as they have all been educated at home by ourselves.", "1236": "And this one I know was more especially beloved by you, as she was the first daughter after four sons, when you longed for a daughter, and so I gave her your name.", "1237": "1", "1238": "And as you are very fond of children your grief must have a peculiar bitterness when you call to mind her pure and simple gaiety, which was without a tincture of passion or querulousness.", "1239": "For she had from nature a wonderful contentedness of mind and meekness, and her affectionateness and winning ways not only pleased one but also afforded a means of observing her kindliness of heart, for she used to bid her nurse2 give the teat not only to other children but even to her favourite playthings, and so invited them as it were to her table in kindliness of heart, and gave them a share of her good things, and pro­ vided the best entertainment for those that pleased her.§", "1240": "III.", "1241": "But I see no reason, my dear wife, why these and similar traits in her character, that gave us delight in her life- time, should now, when recalled to the memory, grieve and trouble us.", "1242": "Though, on the other hand, I fear that if we cease to grieve we may also cease to remember her, like Clymene, who says in the Play 1— “ I hate the supple bow of cornel-wood, And would put down athletics,\" because she ever avoided and trembled at anything that re­ minded her of her son, for it brought grief with it, and it is natural to avoid everything that gives us pain.", "1243": "But as she gave us the greatest pleasure in embracing her and even in seeing and hearing her, so ought her memory living and dwelling with us to give us more, aye, many times more, joy than grief, since those arguments that we have often used to others ought to be profitable to us in the present conjuncture, nor should we sit down and rail against fortune, opposing to those joys many more griefs.", "1244": "§ iv.", "1245": "Those who were present at the funeral tell me with evident surprise that you put on no mourning, and that you bedizened up neither yourself nor your maids with the trappings of woe, and that there was no ostentatious ex­ penditure of money at the funeral, but that everything was done orderly and silently in the presence of our relations.", "1246": "I am not myself surprised that yon, who never made a dis­ play either at the theatre or on any other public occasion, and thought extravagance useless even in the case of pleasure, should have been frugal in your grief.", "1247": "For not only ought the chaste woman to remain uncorrupt in Bacchanalian revels,2 but she ought to consider her self- control not a whit less necessary in the surges of sorrow and emotion of grief, contending not (as most people think) against natural affection, but against the extravagant wishes of the soul.", "1248": "For we are indulgent to natural affection in the regret, and honour, and memory that it pays to the dead :", "1249": "but the insatiable desire for a passionate display of funeral grief, coming to the climax in coronachs and beatings of the breast, is not less unseemly than intemperance in pleasure and is unreasonably1 forgiven only because pain and grief instead of delight are elements in the unseemly exhibition.", "1250": "For what is more unreasonable than to curtail excessive laughter or any other demonstration of joy, and to allow a free vent to copious lamentation and wailing that come from the same source ?", "1251": "And how unreasonable is it, as some husbands do, to quarrel with their wives about perfume and purple robes, while they allow them to shear their heads in mourning, and to dress in black, and to sit in idle grief, and to lie down in weariness !", "1252": "And what is worst of all, how unreasonable is it for husbands to inter­ fere if their wives chastise the domestics and maids im­ moderately or without sufficient cause, yet allow them to ill-treat themselves cruelly in cases and conjunctures that require repose and kindness !.§ v.", "1253": "But between us, my dear wife, there never was any occasion for such a contest, nor do I think there ever will be.", "1254": "For as to your economy in dress and simple way of living, there is no philosopher with whom you are acquainted whom you did not amaze,

fortitude, as when you lost your eldest son, and again when our handsome Chæron died.", "1256": "For when I was informed of his death, I well remember some guests from the sea were coming home with me

happened, but that the news was untrue.", "1257": "So well had you ordered everything in the house, at a time when there would have been great excuse for disorder.", "1258": "And yet you had suckled

when their children are brought to them clean and tidy, take them into their hands as playthings, and when they die burst out into idle and unthankful grief, not so much out of affection-for affec­ tion is thoughtful and noble-but a great yearning for vain glory1 mixed with a little natural affection makes their grief fierce and vehement and hard to appease.", "1262": "And this does not seem to have escaped Æsop’s notice, for he says that when Zeus assigned their honours to various gods, Grief also claimed his.", "1263": "And Zeus granted his wish, with this limitation that only those who chose and wished need pay him honour.", "1264": "2", "1265": "It is thus with grief at the outset, everyone welcomes it at first, but after it has got by process of time settled, and become an inmate

wearing mourning or shearing the hair, or by any similar outward sign of sorrow.", "1267": "For these things occurring daily and being importunate make the mind little, and narrow, and unsocial, and harsh, and timid, so that, being besieged and taken in hand by grief, it can no longer laugh, and shuns daylight, and avoids society.", "1268": "This evil will be followed by neglect of the body, and dislike to anointing and the bath and the other usual modes of life :", "1269": "whereas the very opposite ought to be the case, for the mind ill at ease especially requires that the body should be in a sound and healthy condition.", "1270": "For much of grief is blunted and relaxed when the body is permeated by calm, like the sea in fine weather.", "1271": "But if the body get into a dry and parched condition from a low diet, and gives no proper nutriment to the soul, but only feeds it with sorrow and grief, as it were with bitter and injurious ex­ halations, it cannot easily recover its tone however people may wish it should.", "1272": "Such is the state of the soul that has been so ill-treated.", "1273": "§ vii.", "1274": "Moreover, I should not hesitate to assert3 that the most formidable peril in connection with this is \" the visits of bad women,” 1 and their chatter, and joint lamentation, all which things fan the fire of sorrow and aggravate it, and suffer it not to be extinguished either by others or by itself.", "1275": "I am not ignorant what a time of it you had lately, when you went to the aid of Theon's sister, and fought against the women who came on a visit of condolence and rushed up with lamentation and wailing, adding fuel as it were to her fire of grief in their simplicity.", "1276": "For when people see their friends' houses on fire they put it out as quickly and energetically as they can, but when their souls are on fire they themselves bring fuel.", "1277": "And if anybody has anything the matter with his eyes they will not let him put his hands to them, however much he wish, nor do they themselves touch the inflamed part;", "1278": "but a person in grief sits down and gives himself up to every chance comer, like a river [that all make use of], to stir up and aggravate the sore, so that from a little tickling and discomfort it grows into a great and terrible disease.", "1279": "However, as to all this I know you will be on your guard.", "1280": "§ vin.", "1281": "Try also often to carry yourself back in memory to that time when, this little girl not having been then born, we bad nothing to charge Fortune with, and to com­ pare that time and this together, as if our circumstances had gone back to what they were then.", "1282": "Otherwise, my dear wife, we shall seem discontented at the birth of our little daughter, if we consider our position before her birth as more perfect.", "1283": "But we ought not to erase from our memory the two years of her life, but to consider them as I a time of pleasure giving us gratification and enjoyment, and not to deem the shortness of the blessing as a great evil, nor to be unthankful for what was given us, because Fortune did not give us a longer tenure as we wished.", "1284": "For ever to be careful what we say about the gods, and to be cheerful and not rail against Fortune, brings a sweet and goodly profit;", "1285": "and he who in such conjunctures as ours mostly tries to remember his blessings, and turns and diverts his mind from the dark and disturbing things in life to the bright and radiant, either altogether extinguishes his grief or makes it small and dim from a comparison with his comforts.", "1286": "For as perfume gives pleasure to the nose, and is a remedy against disagreeable smells, so the remembrance of past happiness in present trouble gives all the relief they require to those who do not shut out of their memory the blessings of the past, or always and everywhere rail against Fortune.", "1287": "And this certainly ought not to be our case, that we should slander all our past life because, like a book, it has one erasure in it, when all the other pages have been bright and clean.", "1288": "§ ix.", "1289": "You have often heard that happiness consists in right calculations resulting in a healthy state of mind, and that the changes which Fortune brings about need not up­ set it, and introduce confusion into our life.", "1290": "But if we too must, like most people, be governed by external events, and make an inventory of the dealings of Fortune, and constitute other people the judges of our felicity, do not now regard the tears and lamentations of those who visit you, which by a faulty custom are lavished on everybody, but consider rather how happy you are still esteemed by them for your family, your house, and life.", "1291": "For it would be monstrous, if others would gladly prefer your destiny to theirs, even taking into account our present sorrow, that you should rail against and be impatient at our present lot, and in consequence of our bitter grief not reflect how much comfort is still left to us.", "1292": "But like those who quote im­ perfect verses of Homer1 and neglect the finest passages of his writings, to enumerate and complain of the trials of life, while you pay no attention to its blessings, is to resemble those stingy misers, who heap up riches and make no use of them when they have them, but lament and are impatient if they are lost.", "1293": "And if you grieve over her dying unmarried and childless, you can comfort yourself with the thought that you have had both those advantages.", "1294": "For they should not be reckoned as great blessings in the case of those who do not enjoy them, and small blessings in the case of those who do.", "1295": "And that she has gone to a place where she is out of pain ought not to pain us, for what evil can we mourn for on her account if her pains are over ?", "1296": "For even the loss of important things does not grieve us when we have no need of them.", "1297": "But it was only little things that your Timoxena was deprived of, little things only she knew, and in little things only did she rejoice ;", "1298": "and how can one be said to be deprived of things of which one had no conception, nor experience, nor even desire for ?§ x.", "1299": "As to what you hear from some people, who get many to credit their notion, that the dead suffer no evil or pain, I know that you are prevented from believing that by the tradition of our fathers and by the mystic symbols of the mysteries of Dionysus, for we are both initiated.", "1300": "Consider then that the soul, being incorruptible, is in the same con­ dition after death as birds that have been caught.", "1301": "For if it has been a long time in the body, and during this mortal life has become tame by many affairs and long habit, it swoops down again and a second time enters the body, and does not cease to be involved in the changes and chances of this life that result from birth.", "1302": "For do not suppose that old age is abused and ill-spoken of only for its wrinkles and white hair and weakness of body, but this is the worst feature about it, that it makes the soul feeble in its re­ membrance of things in the other world, and strong in its attachment to things in this world, and bends and presses it, if it retain the form which it had in the body from its experience.", "1303": "But that soul, which does indeed enter the body, but remains only a short time in it, being liberated from it by the higher powers, rears as it were at a damp and soft turning post in the race of life, and hastens on to its destined goal.", "1304": "For just as if anyone put out a fire, and light it again at once, it is soon rekindled, and burns up again quickly, but if it has been out a long time, to light it again will be a far more difficult and irksome task, so the soul that has sojourned only a short time in this dark and mortal life, quickly recovers the light and blaze of its former bright life, whereas for those who have not had the good fortune very early, to use the language of the poet, \" to pass the gates of Hades,”1 nothing remains but a great passion for the things of this life, and a softening of the soul through contact with the body, and a melting away of it as if by the agency of drugs.1§ xi.", "1305": "And the truth of this is rendered more apparent in our hereditary and time-honoured customs and laws.", "1306": "For when infants die no libations are poured out for them, nor are any other rites performed for them, such as are always performed for adults.", "1307": "For they have no share in the earth or in things of the earth, nor do parents haunt their tombs or monuments, or sit by their bodies when they are laid out.", "1308": "For the laws do not allow us to mourn for such, seeing that it is an impious thing to do so in the case of persons who have departed into a better and more divine place and sphere.", "1309": "I know that doubts are entertained about this, but since to doubt is harder for them than to believe, let us do externally as the laws enjoin, and in­ ternally let us be more holy and pure and chaste.", "1310": "2§ I.", "1311": "As to virtue we deliberate and dispute whether good sense, and justice, and rectitude can be taught:", "1312": "and then we are not surprised

magisterial office.", "1325": "On one occasion, when a boy was eating rather greedily, Diogenes gave the lad's tutor a blow with his fist, ascribing the fault not to the boy, who had not learnt how to eat properly, but to the tutor who had not taught him.", "1326": "And can one not properly handle a dish or a cup, unless one has learnt from a boy, as Aristophanes bids us, \" not to giggle, nor eat

affabilities, and versatilities, and filled philo­ sophy, which did not at all require it, with many strange names.§ III.", "1389": "Now all these agree in supposing virtue to be a disposition and faculty of the governing part of the soul set in motion by reason, or rather to be reason itself con­ formable and firm and immutable.", "1390": "They think further that the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is not by any natural difference distinct from the reasoning part, but that that same part of the soul, which they call intel­ lect and the leading principle of action, being altogether diverted and changed by the passions, and by the alterations which habit or disposition have brought about, becomes either vice or virtue, without having in itself any unreason­ ing element, but that it is called unreasoning when, by the strong and overpowering force of appetite, it launches out into excesses contrary to the direction of reason.", "1391": "For passion, according to them, is only vicious and intemperate reason, getting its strength and power from bad and faulty judgement.", "1392": "But all of those philosophers seem to have been ignorant that we are all in reality two-fold and com­ posite, though they did not recognize it, and only saw the more evident mixture of soul and body.", "1393": "And yet that there is in the soul itself something composite and two-fold and dissimilar (the unreasoning part of it, as if another body, being by necessity and nature mixed up with and united to reason), seems not to have escaped the notice even of Pythagoras, as we infer from his zeal for music, which be introduced to calm and soothe the soul, as knowing that it was not altogether amenable to precept and instruction, or redeemable from vice only by reason, but that it needed some other persuasion and moulding and softening influence to co-operate with reason, unless it were to be altogether intractable and refractory to philosophy.", "1394": "And Plato saw very plainly and confidently and decidedly that the soul of this universe is not simple or uncomposite or uniform, but is made up of forces that work uniformly and differently, in the one case it is ever marshalled in the same order and moves about in one fixed orbit, in the other case it is divided into motions and orbits contrary to each other and changing about, and thus generates differences in things.", "1395": "So, too, the soul of man, being a part or portion of the soul of the universe, and compounded upon similar principles and proportions, is not simple or entirely uniform, but has one part intelligent and reasoning, which is intended by nature to rule and dominate in man, and another part un­ reasoning, and subject to passion and caprice, and dis­ orderly, and in need of direction.", "1396": "And this last again is divided into two parts, one of which, being most closely connected with the body, is called desire, and the other, sometimes taking part with the body, sometimes with reason, lending its influence against the body, is called anger.", "1397": "And the difference between reason and sense on the one hand, and anger and desire on the other, is shown by their antipathy to one another, so that they are often at variance with one another as to what is best.", "1398": "1", "1399": "These were at first2 the views of Aristotle, as is clear from his writings, though afterwards he joined anger to desire, as if anger were nothing but a desire and passion for revenge.", "1400": "How­ ever, he always considered the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul as distinct from the reasoning, not that it is altogether unreasoning as the perceptive, or nutritive, or vegetative portions of the soul, for these are always deaf and disobedient to reason, and in a certain sense are off­ shoots from the flesh, and altogether attached to the body;", "1401": "but the emotional, though it is destitute of any reason of its own, yet is naturally inclined to listen to reason and sense, and turn and submit and mould itself accordingly, unless it be entirely corrupted by brute pleasure and a life of indulgence.", "1402": "§ IV.", "1403": "As for those who wonder that what is unreasoning should obey reason, they do not seem to me to recognize the power of reason, how great it is, and how far-reaching its dominion is-a power not gained by harsh and repelling methods, but by attractive ones, as mild persuasion which always accomplishes more than compulsion or violence.", "1404": "For even the spirit and nerves and bones, and other parts of the body, though devoid of reason, yet at any instigation of reason, when she shakes as it were the reins, are all on the alert and compliant and obedient, the feet to run, and the hands to throw or lift, at her bidding.", "1405": "Right excel­ lently has the poet set forth in the following lines the sympathy and accordance between the unreasoning and reason :", "1406": "­ “", "1407": "Thus were her beauteous cheeks diffused with tears, Weeping her husband really present then.", "1408": "But though Odysseus pitied her in heart, His eyes like horn or steel impassive stood Within their lids, and craft his tears repressed.”", "1409": "1", "1410": "So completely under the control of judgement did he keep his spirit and blood and tears.", "1411": "The same is shown by the subsidence of our passions, which are laid to rest in the presence of handsome women or boys, whom reason and the law forbid us to touch ;", "1412": "a case which most frequently happens to lovers, when they hear that they have unwit­ tingly fallen in love with a sister or daughter.", "1413": "For at once passion is laid at the voice of reason, and the body exhibits its members as subservient to decorum.", "1414": "And fre­ quently in the case of dainty food, people very much attracted by it, if they find out at the time or learn after­ wards that they have eaten what is unclean or unlawful, not only suffer distress and grief in their imagination, but even their very body is upset by the notion, and violent retchings and vomitings follow.", "1415": "1", "1416": "I fear I should seem to be introducing merely novel and enticing arguments, if I 1 were to enumerate stringed instruments and lyres, and harps and flutes, and other harmonious musical instruments, which, although inanimate, yet speak to man's passions, rejoicing with him, and mourning with him, and chiming in with him, and rioting with him,—in a word, falling in with the vein and emotions and characters of those that play on them.", "1417": "And they say that Zeno on one occasion, going into the theatre when Amœbeus 2 was playing on the harp, said to the pupils, \" Let us go and learn what music can be produced by guts and nerves and wood and bones, when they preserve proportion and time and order.\"", "1418": "But passing these things over, I would gladly learn from them, if, when they see dogs and horses and birds domes­ ticated, and by habit and training uttering sounds that can be understood, and making obedient movements and gestures, and acting quietly and usefully to us, and when they notice that Achilles in Homer cheers on horses as well as men to the fight,3 they still wonder and doubt, whether the passionate and emotional and painful and pleasurable elements in us are by nature obedient to the voice of reason, and influenced and affected by it, seeing that those elements are not apart from us or detached from us, or formed from outside, or hammered into us by force, but are innate in us, and ever associate with us, and are nourished within us, and abound in us through habit.", "1419": "Accordingly moral character is well called by the Greeks ἡ̃θος, for it is, to speak generally, a quality of the unrea­ soning element in man, and is called ἡ̃θος because the un­ reasoning element moulded by reason receives this quality and difference by habit, which is called ἔθος.4", "1420": "Not that reason wishes to expel passion altogether (that is neither possible, nor advisable), but only to keep it within bounds and order, and to engender the moral virtues, which are not apathetic, but hold the due proportion and mean in regard to passion.", "1421": "And this she does by reducing the power of passion to a good habit.", "1422": "For there are said to be three things existing in the soul, power, passion, and habit.", "1423": "Power is the principle or matter of passion, as power to be angry, ashamed, or confident:", "1424": "and passion is the actual setting in motion of that power, being itself anger, con­ fidence, or shame;", "1425": "and habit is the strong formation of power in the unreasoning element engendered by use, being vice if the passions are badly tutored by reason, virtue if they are well tutored.", "1426": "§ v.", "1427": "But since they do not regard every virtue as a mean, nor call it moral, we must discuss this difference by approaching the matter more from first principles.", "1428": "Some things in the world exist absolutely, as the earth, the sky, the stars, and the sea;", "1429": "others have relation to us, as good and evil, as what is desirable or to be avoided, as pleasant and painful:", "1430": "and since reason has an eye to both of these classes, when it considers the former it is scientific and contempt dive, when it considers the latter it is deliberative and practical.", "1431": "And prudence is the virtue in the latter case, as knowledge in the former.", "1432": "And there is this diffe­ rence between prudence and knowledge, prudence consists in applying the contemplative to the practical and emotional so as to make reason paramount.", "1433": "On which account it often needs the help of fortune;", "1434": "whereas knowledge needs neither the help of fortune nor deliberation to gain its ends:", "1435": "for it considers only things which are always the same.", "1436": "And as the geometrician does not deliberate about the triangle, as to whether its interior angles are together equal to two right angles, for he knows it as a fact-and deliberation only takes place in the case of things which differ at different times, not in the case of things which are certain and unchangeable—so the contemplative mind having its scope in first principles, and things that are fixed, and that ever have one nature which does not admit of change, has no need for deliberation.", "1437": "But prudence, which has to enter into matters full of obscurity and confusion, frequently has to take its chance, and to deliberate about things which are uncertain, and, in carrying the deliberation into practice, has to co- operate with the unreasoning element, which comes to its help, and is involved in its decisions, for they need an impetus.", "1438": "Now this impetus is given to passion by the moral character, an impetus requiring reason to regulate it, that it may render moderate and not excessive help, and at the seasonable time.", "1439": "For the emotional and unreasoning elements are subject to motions sometimes too quick and vehement, at other times too remiss and slow.", "1440": "And so everything we do may be a success from one point of view, but a failure from many points of view ;", "1441": "as to hit the mark one thing only is requisite, but one may miss it in various ways, as one may shoot beyond or too short.", "1442": "This then is the function of practical reason following nature, to prevent our passions going either too far or too short.", "1443": "For where from weakness and want of strength, or from fear and hesitation, the impetus gives in and abandons what is good, there reason is by to stir it up and rekindle it;", "1444": "and where on the other hand it goes ahead too fast and in disorder, there it represses and checks its zeal.", "1445": "And thus setting bounds to the emotional motions, it engenders in the un­ reasoning part of the soul moral virtues, which are the mean between excess and deficiency.", "1446": "Not that we can say that all virtue exists in the mean, but knowledge and prudence being in no need of the unreasoning element, and being situated in the pure and unemotional part of the soul, is a complete perfection and power of reason, whereby we get the most divine and happy fruit of understanding.", "1447": "But that virtue which is necessary because of the body, and needs the help of the passions as an instrument towards the practical, not destroying or doing away with but ordering and regulating the unreasoning part of the soul, is per­ fection as regards its power and quality, but in quantity is is a mean correcting both excess and deficiency.", "1448": "§ vi.", "1449": "But since the word mean has a variety of meanings -for there is one kind of mean compounded of two simple extremes, as grey is the mean between white and black;", "1450": "and there is another kind of mean, where that which con­ tains and is contained is the mean between the containing and contained, as eight is the mean between twelve and four;", "1451": "and there is a third kind of mean which has part in neither extreme, as the indifferent is the mean between good and bad,-virtue cannot be a mean in any of these ways.", "1452": "For neither is it a mixture of vices, nor containing that which is defective is it contained by that which is excessive, nor is it again altogether free from emotional storms of passion, wherein are excess and deficiency.", "1453": "But it is, and is commonly so called, a mean like that in music and harmony.", "1454": "For as in music there is a middle note between the highest and lowest in the scale, which being perfectly in tune avoids the sharpness of the one and the flatness of the other;", "1455": "so virtue, being a motion and power in the unreasoning part of the soul, takes away the remiss­ ness and strain, aud generally speaking the excess and defect of the appetite, by reducing each of the passions to a state of mean and rectitude.", "1456": "For example, they tell us that bravery is the mean between cowardice and foolhardi­ ness, whereof the former is a defect, the latter an excess of anger :", "1457": "and that liberality is the mean between stinginess and prodigality :", "1458": "and that meekness is the mean between insensibility and savageness :", "1459": "and so of temperance and justice, that the latter, being concerned with contracts, is to assign neither too much nor too little to litigants, and that the former ever reduces the passions to the proper mean between apathy (or insensibility) and gross intemperance.", "1460": "This last illustration serves excellently to show us the radical difference between the unreasoning and reasoning parts of the soul, and to prove to us that passion and reason are wide as the poles asunder.", "1461": "For the difference would not be discernible between temperance and conti­ nence, nor between intemperance and incontinence, in pleasure and desires, if the appetite and judgement were in the same portion of the soul.", "1462": "Now temperance is a state, wherein reason holds the reins, and manages the passions as a quiet and well-broken-in animal, finding them obedient and submissive to the reins and masters over their desires.", "1463": "Continence on the other hand is not driven by reason without some trouble, not being docile but jibbing and kicking, like an animal compelled by bit and bridle and whip and backing, being in itself full of struggles and com­ motion.", "1464": "Plato explains this by his simile of the chariot- horses of the soul, the worse one of which ever kicking against the other and disturbing the charioteer, he is obliged ever to hold them in with all his might, and to tighten the reins, lest, to borrow the language of Simonides, \" he should drop from his hands the purple reins.\"", "1465": "And so they do not consider continence to be an absolute virtue, but something less than a virtue;", "1466": "for no mean arises from the concord of the worse with the better, nor is the excess of the passion curtailed, nor does the appetite obey or act in unison with reason, but it both gives and suffers trouble, and is constrained by force, and is as it were an enemy in a town given up to faction. \"", "1467": "The town is full of incense, and at once Resounds with triumph-songs and bitter wailing.\"", "1468": "1 Such is the state of soul of the continent person owing to his conflicting condition.", "1469": "On the same grounds they con­ sider incontinence to be something less than vice, but intemperance to be a complete vice.", "1470": "For it, having both its appetite and and reason depraved, is by the one carried away to desire disgraceful things,2 by the other, through bad judgement consenting to desire, loses even the percep­ tion of wrongdoing.", "1471": "But incontinence keeps its judgement sound through reason, but is carried away against its judge­ ment by passion which is too strong for reason, whence it differs from intemperance.", "1472": "For in the one case reason is mastered by passion, in the other it does not even make a fight against it, in the one case it opposes its desires even when it follows them, in the other it is their advocate and even leader, in the one case it gladly participates in what is wrong, in the other sorrowfully, in the one case it willingly rushes into what is disgraceful, in the other it abandons the honourable unwillingly.", "1473": "And as there is a difference in their deeds, so no less manifest is the difference in their language.", "1474": "For these are the expressions of the intemperate. \"", "1475": "What grace or pleasure in life is there without golden Aphrodite ?", "1476": "May I die, when I care no longer for these things !”", "1477": "And another says, \" To eat, to drink, to enjoy the gifts of Aphrodite is everything, for all other things I look upon as supplementary,\" as if from the bottom of his soul he gave himself up to pleasures, and was completely subverted by them.", "1478": "And not less so he who said, \" Let me be ruined, it is best for me,\" had his judgement diseased through his passion.", "1479": "But the sayings of incontinence are quite different, as \"", "1480": "My nature forces me against ray judgement,”1 and \" Alas!", "1481": "it is poor mortals' plague and bane, To know the good, yet not the good pursue.\"", "1482": "2 And again­", "1483": "“My anger draws me on, has no control, 'Tis but a sandy hook against a tempest.\"", "1484": "Here he compares not badly to a sandy hook, a sorry kind of anchor, the soul that is unsettled and has no steady reason, but surrenders judgment through flabbiness and feebleness.", "1485": "And not unlike this image are the lines, “ As some ship moored and fastened to the shore, If the wind blows, the cables cannot hold it.\"", "1486": "By cables he means the judgement which resists what is disgraceful, though sometimes it gives way under a tre­ mendous storm of passion.", "1487": "For indeed it is with full sail that the intemperate man is borne on to pleasure by his desires, and surrenders himself to them, and even plays the part of pilot to the vessel ;", "1488": "whereas the incontinent Yuan is dragged sidelong into the disgraceful, and is its vic­ tim, as it were, while he desires eagerly to resist and over­ come his passion, as Timon bantered Anaxarchus :", "1489": "\"", "1490": "The recklessness and frantic energy of Anaxarchus to rush any­ where seemed like a dog's courage, but he being aware of it was miserable, so people said, but his voluptuous nature ever plunged him into excesses again, nature which even most sophists are afraid of.\"", "1491": "For neither is the wise man continent but temperate, nor the fool incontinent but intem­ perate ;", "1492": "for the one delights in what is good, and the other is not vexed at what is bad.", "1493": "Incontinence, therefore, is a mark of a sophistical soul, endued with reason which can­ not abide by what it knows to be right.§ VII.", "1494": "Such, then, are the differences between inconti­ nence and intemperance, and continence and temperance have their counterpart and analogous differences;", "1495": "for re­ morse and trouble and annoyance are companions of con­ tinence, whereas in the soul of the temperate person there is everywhere such equability and calm and soundness, by which the unreasoning is adjusted and harmonized to reason, being adorned with obedience and wonderful mild­ ness, that looking at it you would say with the poet, \"", "1496": "At once the wind was laid, and a wondrous calm ensued, for the god alloyed the fury of the waves,”1 reason having ex­ tinguished the vehement and furious and frantic motions of the desires, and making those which nature necessarily requires sympathetic and obedient and friendly and co­ operative in carrying purposes out in action, so that they do not outrun or come short of reason, or behave disorderly and disobediently, but that every appetite is tractable, \" as sucking foal runs by the side of its dam.”", "1497": "2", "1498": "And this con­ firms the saying of Xenocrates about true philosophers, that they alone do willingly what all others do unwillingly at the compulsion of the Jaw, as dogs are turned away from their pleasures by a blow, or cats by a noise, looking at nothing but their danger.", "1499": "It is clear then that there is in the soul a perception of such a generic and specific difference in relation to the desires, as of something fight­ ing against and opposing them.", "1500": "But some say that there is no radical distinction difference or variance between reason and passion, but that there is a shifting of one and the same reason from one to the other, which escapes our notice owing to the sharpness and quickness of the change, so that we do not see at a glance that desire and repent­ ance, anger and fear, giving way to what is disgraceful through passion, and recovery from the same, are the same natural property of the soul.", "1501": "For desire and fear and anger and the like they consider only depraved opinions and judgements, not in one portion of the soul only but in all its leading principles, inclinations and yieldings, and assents and impulses, and generally speaking in its energies soon changed, like the sallies of children, whose fury and excessive violence is unstable by reason of their weakness.", "1502": "But these views are, in the first place, contrary to evidence and observation;", "1503": "for no one observes in himself a change from passion to judgement, and from judgement back to passion ;", "1504": "nor does anyone cease from loving when he reflects that it would be well to break the affair off and strive with all his might against it;", "1505": "nor again, does he put on one side reflection and judgement, when he gives way and is over­ come by desire.", "1506": "Moreover, when he resists passion by reason, he does not escape passion altogether;", "1507": "nor again, when he is mastered by passion does he fail to discern his fault through reason :", "1508": "so that neither by passion does he abolish reason, nor does he by reason get rid of passion, but is tossed about to and fro alternately between passion and reason.", "1509": "And those who suppose that the leading principle in the soul is at one time desire, and at another time reason in opposition to desire, are not unlike people who would make the hunter and the animal he hunts one and the same person, but alternately changing from hunter to animal, from animal to hunter.", "1510": "As their eyesight is plainly defi­ cient, so these are faulty in regard to their perceptions, seeing that they must perceive in themselves not a change of one and the same thing, but a difference and struggle between two opposing elements. \"", "1511": "What then,\" say they, “ does not the deliberative element in a man often hold different views, and is it not swayed to different opinions as to expediency, and yet it is one and the same thing ?\"", "1512": "Certainly, I reply;", "1513": "but the case is not similar.", "1514": "For the rational part of the soul does not fight against itself, but though it has only one faculty, it makes use of different reasonings;", "1515": "or rather the reasoning is one, but employs itself in different subjects as on different matter.", "1516": "And so there is neither pain in reasonings without passion, nor are men compelled, as it were, to choose something contrary to their judgement, unless indeed some passion, as in a balance, secretly predominates in the scale.", "1517": "For this often happens, reason not opposing reason, but ambition, or contention, or favour, or jealousy, or fear opposing reason, that we do but think there is a difference between two reasons, as in the line, \" They were ashamed to refuse, and feared to accept,”1 or, \" To die in battle is dreadful but glorious;", "1518": "but not to die, though cowardly, is more pleasant.\"", "1519": "Moreover, in judge­ ments about contracts passions come in and cause the greatest delay;", "1520": "and in the councils of kings those who speak to ingratiate themselves do not favour either of the two cases, but give themselves up to passion without re­ gard to what is expedient;", "1521": "and so those that rule in aris­ tocracies do not allow orators to be pathetic in their plead­ ings.", "1522": "For reasoning without passion has a direct tendency to justice, while if passion is infused, a contest and diffe­ rence is excited between pleasure and pain on the one hand, and judgement and justice on the other.", "1523": "For otherwise how is it that in philosophical speculations people are with little pain frequently induced by others to change their opinions, and even Aristotle himself and Democritus and Chrysippus have rejected without trouble or pain, and even with pleasure, some of the opinions which they for­ merly advocated ?", "1524": "For no passion stands in the way in the theoretic and scientific part of the soul, and the un­ reasoning element is quiet and gives no trouble therein.", "1525": "And so reason gladly inclines to the truth, when it is evident, and abandons error;", "1526": "for in it, and not in passion, lies a willingness to listen to conviction and to change one's opinions on conviction.", "1527": "But the deliberations and judgements and arbitrations of most people as to matters of fact being mixed up with passion, give reason no easy or pleasant access, as she is held fast and incommoded by the unreasonable, which assails her through pleasure, or fear, or pain, or desire.", "1528": "And the decision in these cases lies with sense which has dealings with both passion and reason, for if one gets the better of the other the other is not destroyed, but only dragged along by force in spite of its resistance.", "1529": "For he who is dissatisfied with himself for falling in love calls in reason to his aid to overcome his passion, for both reason and passion are in his soul, and he perceives they are contrary one to the other, and violently represses the inflammatory one of the two.", "1530": "On the other hand, in deliberations and speculations without passion (such as the contemplative part of the soul is most con. versant with), if they are evenly balanced no decision takes place, but the matter is left in doubt, which is a sort of stationary position of the mind in conflicting arguments.", "1531": "But should there be any inclination to one of the two sides, the most powerful opinion carries the day, yet without giv­ ing pain or creating hostility.", "1532": "And, generally speaking, when reason seems opposed to reason, there is no percep­ tion of two distinct things, but only of one under different phases, whereas when the unreasoning has a controversy with reason, since there can be no victory or defeat with­ out pain, forthwith they tear the soul in two,1 and make the difference between them apparent.§ VIlI.", "1533": "And not only from their contest, but quite as much from their agreement, can we see that the source of the passions is something quite distinct from that of reason.", "1534": "For since2 one may love either a good and excellent child or a bad and vicious one, and be unreasonably angry with one's children or parents, yet in behalf of them show a just anger against enemies or tyrants ;", "1535": "as in the one case there is the perception of a difference and struggle between pas­ sion and reason, so in the other there is a perception of persuasion and agreement inclining, as it were, the scale, and giving their help.", "1536": "Moreover a good man marrying a wife according to the laws is minded to associate and live with her justly and soberly, but as time goes on, his intercourse with her having engendered a strong passion for her, he perceives that his love and affection are increased by reason.", "1537": "Just so, again, young fellows falling in with kindly teachers at first submit themselves to them out of necessity and emulation for learning, but end by loving them, and instead of being their pupils and scholars become and get the titleof their lovers.", "1538": "The same is the case in cities in respect to good magistrates, and neighbours, and connections by marriage;", "1539": "for beginning at first to associate with one another from necessity and propriety, they afterwards go on to love almost insensibly, reason drawing over and persuading the emotional element.", "1540": "And he who said­ \"", "1541": "There are two kinds of shame, the one not bad, The other a sad burden to a family,”1 is it not clear that he felt this emotion in himself often contrary to reason and detrimental by hesitation and delay to opportunities and actions ?§ ix.", "1542": "In a certain sense yielding to the force of these arguments, they call shame modesty, pleasure joy, and timidity caution;", "1543": "nor would anyone blame them for this euphemism, if they only gave those specious names to the emotions that are consistent with reason, while they gave other kinds of names to those emotions that resist and do violence to reason.", "1544": "But whenever, though convicted by their tears and tremblings and changes of colour, they avoid the terms pain and fear, and speak of bitings and states of excitement, and gloss over the passions by calling them inclinations, they seem to contrive evasions and flights from facts by names sophistical, and not philosophical.", "1545": "And yet again they seem to use words rightly when they call those joys and wishes and cautions not apathies but good conditions of the mind.", "1546": "For it is a happy disposition of the soul when reason does not annihilate passion, but orders and arranges it in the case of temperate persons.", "1547": "But what is the condition of worthless and incontinent persons, who, when they judge they ought to love their father and mother better than some boy or girl they are enamoured of, yet cannot, and yet at once love their mistress or flat­ terer, when they judge they ought to hate them ?", "1548": "For if passion and judgement were the same thing, love and hate would immediately follow the judging it right to love and hate, whereas the contrary happens, passion following some judgements, but declining to follow others.", "1549": "Wherefore they acknowledge, the facts compelling them to do so, that every judgement is not passion, but only that judgement that is provocative of violent and excessive impulse:", "1550": "ad- mitting that judgement and passion in us are something different, as what moves is different from what is moved.", "1551": "Even Chrysippus himself, by his defining in many places endurance and continence to be habits that follow the lead of reason, proves that he is compelled by the facts to admit, that that element in us which follows absolutely is some­ thing different from that which follows when persuaded, but resists when not persuaded.", "1552": "§ x. Now as to those who make all sins and offences equal, it is not now the occasion to discuss if in other respects they deviate from truth:", "1553": "but as regards the pas­ sions 1 they seem to go clean contrary to reason and evi­ dence.", "1554": "For according to them every passion is a sin, and everyone who grieves, or fears, or desires, commits sin.", "1555": "But in good truth it is evident that there are great diffe­ rences between passions, according as one is more or less affected by them.", "1556": "For who would say that the craven fear of Dolon 2 was not something very

death of Socrates was identical with the grief of Alexander at the death of Clitus, when he attempted to lay violent hands on himself ?", "1558": "For grief is beyond measure intensified by falling

perity and admiration, one should hear that he had been put to the torture, as Parmenio heard about Philotas.", "1561": "And who would say that the anger of Magas against Philemon was equal to that of Nicocreon against Anaxarchus ?", "1562": "Both Magas and Nicocreon had been insulted, but whereas Nicocreon brayed Anaxarchus to death with iron pestles and made mincemeat of him, Magas contented himself with bidding the executioner lay his naked sword on Philemon's neck, and then let him go.'", "1563": "And so Plato called anger the nerves of the mind, since it can be both intensified by bitterness, and slackened by mildness.", "1564": "To evade these and similar arguments, they deny that intensity and excess of passion are according to judgement, wherein is the pro­ pensity to fault, but maintain that they are bites and con­ tractions and diffusings capable of increase or diminution through the unreasoning element.", "1565": "And yet it is evident that there are differences as regards judgements;", "1566": "for some judge poverty to be no evil, while others judge it to be a great evil, and others again the very greatest evil, insomuch that they even throw themselves headlong down rocks and into the sea on account of it.", "1567": "Again as to death, some think it an evil only in depriving us of good things, whereas others think it so in regard to eternal punishments and awful torments in the world below.", "1568": "Health again is valued by some as natural and advantageous, while to others it seems the greatest blessing of life, in comparison with which they reckon little either of wealth or children or \" royal power that makes one equal to the gods,\" and at last come to think even virtue useless and unprofitable, if health be absent.", "1569": "Thus it is clear that even with regard to judge­ ments themselves some err more, some less.", "1570": "But I shall bring no further proof of this now, but this one may assume therefrom, that they themselves concede that the unreason­ ing element is something different from judgement, in that they allow that by it passion becomes greater and more violent, and while they quarrel about the name and word they give up the thing itself to those who maintain that the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is distinct from the reasoning and judging element.", "1571": "And in his treatise on Anomaly,1 Chrysippus, after telling us that anger is blind, and frequently does not let one see what is obvious, frequently also obscures what we do get a sight of, goes on to say, \" The encroachment of the passions blots out reason, and makes things look different to what they should look, violently forcing people on unreasonable acts.\"", "1572": "And he quotes as witness Menander, who says, \" Alas !", "1573": "poor me, wherever were my brains in my body at the time when I chose that line of conduct, and not this ? \"", "1574": "And Chrysippus proceeds, \" Though every living creature en­ dowed with reason is naturally inclined to use reason and to be governed by it on every occasion, yet often do we reject it, being borne away by a more violent impulse;", "1575": "\" thus admitting what results from the difference between passion and reason.", "1576": "For otherwise it is ridiculous, as Plato says, to argue that a man is sometimes better than himself, sometimes worse, sometimes master of himself, sometimes not master of himself.", "1577": "§ xi.", "1578": "For how is it possible that the same person can be both better and worse than himself, both master of himself and not master, unless everyone is in some way twofold, having in himself both a better and worse self ?", "1579": "For so he that makes the baser element subject to the better has self- control and is a superior man, whereas he who allows the nobler element of the soul to follow and be subservient to the incorrigible and unreasoning element, is inferior to what he might be, and is called incontinent, and is in an unnatural condition.", "1580": "For by nature it appertains to reason, which is divine, to rule and govern the unreasoning ele­ ment, which has its origin from the body, which it also naturally resembles and participates in its passions, being placed in it and mixed up with it, as is proved by the im­ pulses to bodily delights, which are always fierce or languid according to the changes of the body.", "1581": "And so it is that young men are keen and vehement in their desires, being red hot and raging from their fulness of blood and animal heat, whereas with old men the liver, which is the seat of desire, is dried up and weak and feeble, and reason has more power with them than passion which decays with the body.", "1582": "This principle also no doubt characterizes the nature of animals as regards the sexual appetite.", "1583": "For it is not of course from any fitness or unfitness of opinions, that some animals are so bold and resolute in the presence of danger, while others are helpless and full of fear and trembling;", "1584": "but this difference of emotion is produced by the workings of the blood and spirit and body, the emotional part growing out of the flesh, as from a root, and carrying along with it its quality and temperament.", "1585": "And that the body of man sympathizes with and is affected by the emotional impulses is proved by pallors, and blushings, and tremblings, and palpitations of the heart, as on the other hand by an all­ pervading joy in the hope and expectation of pleasures.", "1586": "But whenever the mind is by itself and unmoved by pas­ sion, the body is in repose and at rest, having no partici­ pation or share in the working of the intellect, unless it involve the emotional, or the unreasoning element call it in.", "1587": "So that it is clear that there are two distinct parts of the soul differing from one another in their faculties.", "1588": "§ XII.", "1589": "And generally speaking of all existing things, as they themselves admit and is clear, some are governed by nature, some by habit, some by an unreasoning soul, some by a soul that has reason and intelligence.", "1590": "Man too par­ ticipates in all this, and is subject to all those differences here mentioned, for he is affected by habit, and nourished by nature, and uses reason and intelligence.", "1591": "He has also a share of the unreasoning element, and has the principle of passion innate in him, not as a mere episode in his life but as a necessity, which ought not therefore to be entirely rooted out, but requires care and attention.", "1592": "For the function of reason is no Thracian or Lycurgean one to root up and destroy all the good elements in passion indis­ criminately with the bad, but, as some genial and mild god, to prune what is wild, and to correct disproportion, and after that to train and cultivate the useful part.", "1593": "For as those who are afraid to get drunk do not pour on the ground their wine, but mix it with water, so those who are afraid of the disturbing element in passion do not eradicate passion altogether but temper it.", "1594": "Similarly with oxen and horses people try to restrain their mad bounds and restive­ ness, not their movements and powers of work, and so reason makes use of the passions when they have become tame and docile, not by cutting out the sinews or altogether mutilating the serviceable part of the soul.", "1595": "For as Pindar says, “ The horse to the chariot, and the ox to the plough, while he that meditates destruction for the boar must find a staunch hound.”", "1596": "1", "1597": "But much more useful than these are the whole tribe of passions when they wait on reason and run parallel to virtue.", "1598": "Thus moderate anger is useful to courage, and hatred of evil to uprightness, and righteous indignation against those who are fortunate beyond their deserts, when they are inflamed in their souls with folly and insolence and need a check.", "1599": "And no one if they wished could pluck away or sever1 natural affection from friend­ ship, or pity from philanthropy, or sympathy both in joy and grief from genuine good-will.", "1600": "And if those err who wish to banish love because of erotic madness, neither are they right who blame all desire because of love of money, but they act like people who refuse to run because they might stumble, or to throw because they might throw wide of the mark, or object to sing altogether because they might make a false note.", "1601": "For as in sounds music does not create melody by the banishment of sharps and flats, and as in bodies the art of the physician procures health not by the doing away of cold and heat but by their being blended in due proportions and quantities, so is victory won in the soul by the powers and motions of the passions being reduced by reason to moderation and due proportion..", "1602": "For excessive grief or fear or joy in the soul (I speak not of mere joy grief or fear), resembles a body swollen or inflamed.", "1603": "And Homer when he says excellently, “ The brave man's colour never changes, nor Is he much frightened,”1 does not take away all fear but only excessive fear, that bravery may not become recklessness, nor confidence fool­ hardiness.", "1604": "So also in regard to pleasure we must do away with excessive desire, and in regard to vengeance with excessive hatred of evil.", "1605": "For so in the former case one will not be apathetic but temperate, and in the latter one will not be savage or cruel but just.", "1606": "But if the passions were entirely removed, supposing that to be possible, reason would become in many duller and blunter, like the pilot in the absence of a storm.", "1607": "And no doubt it is from having noticed this that legislators try to excite in states ambition and emulation among their townsmen, and stir up and increase their courage and pugnacity against enemies by the sound of trumpets and flutes.", "1608": "For it is not only in poems, as Plato says, that he that is inspired by the Muses, and as it were possessed by them, will laugh to shame the plodding artist, but also in fighting battles passion and en­ thusiasm will be irresistible and invincible, such as Homer makes the gods inspire men with, as in the line, “ Thus speaking he infused great might in Hector, The shepherd of the people.", "1609": "1 and, “ He is not mad like this without the god,\"2 as if the god had added passion to reason as an incitement and spur.", "1610": "And you may see those very persons, whose opinions I am combating, frequently urging on the young by praises, and frequently checking them by rebukes, though pleasure follows the one, pain the other.", "1611": "For rebukes and censure produce repentance and shame, the one bringing grief, the other fear, and these they mostly make use of for purposes of correction.", "1612": "And so Diogenes, when Plato was being praised, said, \" What has he to vaunt of, who has been a philosopher so long, and yet never gave pain to anyone ? \"", "1613": "For one could not say, to use the words of Xenocrates, that the mathematics are such handles to philosophy as are the emotions of young men, such as shame, desire, repentance, pleasure, pain, ambition, whereon reason and the law laying a suitable grip succeed in putting the young man on the right road.", "1614": "So that it was no bad remark of the Lacedæmonian tutor, that he would make the boy entrusted to his charge pleased with what was good and displeased with what was bad,3 for a higher or nobler aim cannot be proposed in the education fit for a freeborn lad.§", "1615": "I. What amount of argument, Sossius Senecio, will make a man know that he is improving in respect to virtue, if his advances in it do not bring about some diminution in folly, but vice, weighing equally with all his good inten­ tions, \" acts like the lead that makes the net go down ?", "1616": "”1 For neither in music nor grammatical knowledge could anyone recognize any improvement, if he remained as unskilful in them as before, and had not lost some of his old ignorance.", "1617": "Nor in the case of anyone ill would medical treatment, if it brought no relief or ease, by the disease somewhat yielding and abating, give any perception of improvement of health, till the opposite condition was corn - pletely brought about by the body recovering its full strength.", "1618": "But just as in these cases there is no improve­ ment unless, by the abatement of what weighs them down till they rise in the opposite scale, they recognize a change, so in the case of those who profess philosophy no improvement or sign of improvement can be supposed, unless the soul lay aside and purge itself of some of its imperfection, and if it continue altogether bad until it become absolutely good and perfect.", "1619": "For indeed a wise man cannot in a moment of time change from absolute badness to perfect goodness, and suddenly abandon for ever all that vice, of which he could not during a long period of time divest himself of any portion.", "1620": "And yet you know, of course, that those who maintain these views fre­ quently give themselves much trouble and bewilderment about the difficulty, that a wise man does not perceive that he has become wise, but is ignorant and doubtful that in a long period of time by little and little, by remov­ ing some things and adding others, there will be a secret and quiet improvement, and as it were passage to virtue.", "1621": "But if the change were so great and sudden that the worst man in the morning could become the best man at night, or should the change so happen that he went to bed vicious and woke up in the morning wise, and, having dismissed from his mind all yesterday's follies and errors, should say, \"False dreams, away, you had no meaning then!\"2 who on earth could be ignorant of so great a change happening to himself, of virtue blazing forth so completely all at once P I myself am of opinion that anyone, like Caeneus,1 who, according, to his prayer, got changed from a woman into a man, would sooner be ignorant of the transformation, than that a man should become at once, from a cowardly and senseless person with no powers of self-control, brave and sensible and perfect master of him­ self, and should in a moment change from a brutish life to a divine without being aware of it.", "1622": "§ II.", "1623": "That was an excellent observation, Measure the stone by the mason's rule, not the rule by the stoned But the Stoics, not applying dogmas to facts but facts to their own preconceived opinions, and forcing things to agree that do not by nature, have filled philosophy with many difficulties, the greatest of which is that all men but the perfect man are equally vicious, which has produced the enigma called progress, one little short of extreme folly, since it makes those who have not at once under its guidance given up all passions and disorders equally un­ fortunate as those who have not got rid of a single vile propensity.", "1624": "However they are their own confuters, for while they lay down in the schools that Aristides was as unjust as Phalaris, and Brasidas as great a craven as Dolon, and Plato actually as senseless as Meletus, in life and its affairs they turn away from and avoid one class as implac­ able, while they make use of the others and trust them in most important matters as most worthy people.§ III.", "1625": "But we who see that in every kind of evil, but especially in a disordered and unsettled state of mind, there are degrees of more and less (so that the progress made differs in different cases, badness abating, as a shadow flees away, under the influence of reason, which calmly illuminates and cleanses the soul), cannot consider it un­ reasonable to think that the change will be perceived, as people who come up out of some ravine can take note of the progress they make upwards.", "1626": "Look at the case from the following point of view first.", "1627": "Just as mariners sailing with full sail over the gaping3 ocean measure the course they have made by the time they have taken and the force of the wind, and compute their progress accordingly, so anyone can compute his progress in philosophy by his con­ tinuous and unceasing course, by his not making many halts on the road, and then again advancing by leaps and bounds, but by his quiet and even and steady march forward guided by reason.", "1628": "For the words of the poet, \"If to a little you keep adding a little, and do so frequently, it will soon be a lot, are not only true of the increase of money, but are universally applicable, and especially to increase in virtue, since reason invokes to her aid the enormous force of habit.", "1629": "On the other hand the inconsistencies and dul­ nesses of some philosophers not only check advance, as it were, on the road, but even break up the journey altogether, since vice always attacks at its leisure and forces back whatever yields to it.", "1630": "2", "1631": "The mathematicians tell us that planets, after completing their course, become stationary;", "1632": "but in philosophy there is no such intermission or stationary position from the cessation of progress, for its nature is ever to be moving and, as it were, to be weighed in the scales, sometimes being overweighted by the good preponderating, sometimes by the bad.", "1633": "If, therefore, imitating the oracle given to the Amphictyones by the god, \" to fight against the people of Cirrha every day and every night,”3 you are con­ scious that night and day you ever maintain a fierce fight against vice, not often relaxing your vigilance, or long off your guard, or receiving as heralds to treat of peace' the pleasures, or idleness, or stress of business, you may reason­ ably go forward to the future courageously and confidently.", "1634": "§ IT.", "1635": "Moreover, if there be any intermissions in philo­ sophy, and yet your later studies are firmer and more con­ tinuous than your former ones, it is no bad indication that your sloth has been expelled by labour and exercise ;", "1636": "for the contrary is a bad sign, when after a short time your lapses from zeal become many and continuous, as if your zeal were dying away.", "1637": "For as in the growth of a reed, which shoots up from the ground finely and beautifully to an even and con- . tinuous height, though at first from its great intervals it is hindered and baffled in its growth, and afterwards through its weakness is discouraged by any breath of air, and though strengthened by many and frequent joints, yet a violent wind gives it commotion and trembling, so those who at first make great launches out into philosophy, and after­ wards find that they are continually hindered and baffled, and cannot perceive that they make any progress, finally get tired of it and cry off.", "1638": "\"", "1639": "But he who is as it were winged,\" 1 is by his simplicity borne along to his end, and by his zeal and energy cuts through impediments to his progress, as merely obstacles on the road.", "1640": "As it is a sign of the growth of violent love, not so much to rejoice in the presence of the loved one, for everyone does that, as to be distressed and grieved at his absence,2 so many feel a liking for philosophy and seem to take a wonderful interest in the study, but if they are diverted by other matters and business their passion evaporates and they take it very easily. \"", "1641": "But whoever is strongly smitten with love for his darling ” 3 will show his mildness and agreeableness in the presence of and joint pursuit of wisdom with the loved one, but if he is drawn away from him and is not in his company you will see him in a stew and ill at ease and peevish whether at work or leisure, and unreasonably for­ getful of his friends, and wholly impelled by his passion for philosophy.", "1642": "For we ought not to rejoice at discourses only when we hear them, as people like perfumes only when they smell them, and not to seek or care about them in their absence, but in the same condition as people who are hungry and thirsty are in if torn away from food and drink, we ought to follow after true proficiency in philosophy, whether marriage, or wealth, or friendship, or military ser­ vice, strike in and produce a separation.", "1643": "For just as more is to be got from philosophy, so much the more does what we fail to obtain trouble us.", "1644": "§ v.", "1645": "Either precisely the same as this or very similar is Hesiod's1 very ancient definition of progress in virtue, namely, that the road is no longer very steep or arduous, but easy and smooth and level, its roughness being toned down by exercise, and casting the bright light of philosophy on doubt and error and regrets, such as trouble those who give themselves to philosophy at the outset, like people who leave a land they know, and do not yet descry the land they are sailing to.", "1646": "For by abandoning the common and familiar, before they know and apprehend what is better, they frequently flounder about in the middle and are fain to return.", "1647": "As they say the Roman Sextius, giving up for philosophy all his honours and offices in Rome, being after­ wards discontented with philosophy from the difficulties he met with in it at first, very nearly threw himself out of window.", "1648": "Similarly they relate of Diogenes of Sinope,2 when he began to be a philosopher, that the Athenians were celebrating a festival, and there were public banquets and shows and mutual festivities, and drinking and re­ velling all night, and he, coiled up in a corner of the market- place intending to sleep, fell into a train of thought likely seriously to turn him from his purpose and shake his resolution, for he reflected that he had adopted without any necessity a toilsome and unusual kind of life, and by his own fault sat there debarred of all the good things.", "1649": "At that moment, however, they say a mouse stole up and be­ gan to munch some of the crumbs of his barley-cake, and he plucked up his courage and said to himself, in a railing and chiding fashion, \"What say you, Diogenes?", "1650": "Do your leavings give this mouse a sumptuous meal, while you, the gentleman, wail and lament because you are not getting drunk yonder and reclining on soft and luxurious couches ? \"", "1651": "Whenever such depressions of mind are not frequent, and the mind when they take place quickly recovers from them, after having put them to flight as it were, and when such annoyance and distraction is easily got rid of, then one may consider one's progress in virtue as a certainty.", "1652": "§ vi.", "1653": "And since not only the things that in themselves shake and turn them in the opposite direction are more powerful in the case of weak philosophers, but also the serious advice of friends, and the playful and jeering objec­ tions of adversaries bend and soften people, and have ere now shaken some out of philosophy altogether, it will be no slight indication of one's progress in virtue if one takes all this very calmly, and is neither disturbed nor aggravated by people who tell us and mention to us that some of our former comrades are flourishing in kings' courts, or have married wives with dowries, or are attended by a crowd of friends when they come down to the forum to solicit some office or advocateship.", "1654": "He that is not moved or affected by all this is already plainly one upon whom philosophy has got a right hold;", "1655": "for it is impossible that we should cease to be envious of what most people admire, unless the admiration of virtue was strongly im­ planted in us.", "1656": "For over-confidence may be generated in some by anger and folly, but to despise what men admire is not possible without a true and steady elevation of mind.", "1657": "And so people in such a condition of mind, comparing it with that of others, pride themselves on it, and say with Solon, \" We would not change virtue for wealth, for while virtue abides,wealth changes hands, and now one man, now another, has it.\"", "1658": "1 And Diogenes compared his shifting about from Corinth to Athens, and again from Thebes to Corinth, to the different residences of the King of Persia, as his spring residence at Susa, his winter residence at Babylon, and his summer residence in Media.", "1659": "And Agesilaus said of the great king, \" How is he better than me, if he is not more upright ? ”", "1660": "And Aristotle, writing to Antipater about Alexander, said, \" that he ought not to think highly of himself because he had many subjects, for anyone who had right notions about the gods was entitled to think quite as highly of himself.,, And Zeno, observing that Theo­ pbrastus was admired for the number of his pupils,2 said, \" His choir is, I admit, larger than mine, but mine is more harmonious.\"§ VII.", "1661": "Whenever then, by thus comparing the advantages of virtue with external things, you get rid of envies and jealousies and those things which fret and depress the minds of many who are novices in philosophy, this also is a great indication of your progress in virtue.", "1662": "Another and no slight indication is a change in the style of your discourses.", "1663": "For generally speaking all novices in philosophy adopt most such as tend to their own glorification;", "1664": "some, like birds, in their levity and ambition soaring to the height and brightness of physical things ;", "1665": "others like young puppies, as Plato1 says, rejoicing in tearing and biting, betake themselves to strifes and questions and sophisms;", "1666": "but most plunging themselves into dialectics immediately store themselves for sophistry ;", "1667": "and some collect sentences3 and histories and go about (as Anacharsis said he saw the Greeks used money for no other purpose but to count it up), merely piling up and comparing them, but making no practical use of them.", "1668": "Applicable here is that saying of Antiphanes, which someone applied to Plato's pupils.", "1669": "Antiphanes said playfully that in a certain city words were frozen directly they were spoken, owing to the great cold, and were thawed again in the summer, so that one could then hear what had been said in the winter.", "1670": "So he said of the words which were spoken by Plato to young men, that most of them only understood them late in life when they were become old men.", "1671": "And this is the condition people are in in respect to all philoso­ phy, until the judgement gets into a sound and healthy state, and begins to adapt itself to those things which can produce character and greatness of mind, and to seek discourses whose footsteps turn inwards rather than outwards, to borrow the language of Æsop.", "1672": "3", "1673": "For as Sophocles said he had first toned down the pompous style of Æschylus, then his harsh and over-artificial method, and had in the third place changed his manner of diction, a most important point and one that is most intimately connected with the character, so those who go in for philosophy, when they have passed from flattering and artificial discourses to such as deal with character and emotion, are beginning to make genuine and modest progress in virtue.", "1674": "§ vInI.", "1675": "Furthermore, take care, in reading the writings of philosophers or hearing their speeches, that you do not attend to words more than things, nor get attracted more by what is difficult and curious than by what is serviceable and solid and useful.", "1676": "And also, in studying poems or history, let nothing escape you of what is said to the point, which is likely either to correct the character or to calm the passions.", "1677": "For as Simonides says the bee hovers among the flowers \" making the yellow honey,”1 while others value and pluck flowers only for their beauty and fragrance, so of all that read poems for pleasure and amusement he alone that finds and gathers what is valuable seems capable of knowledge from his acquaintance with and friendship for what is noble and good.", "1678": "2", "1679": "For those who study Plato and Xenophon only for their style, and cull out only what is pure and Attic, and as it were the dew and the bloom, do they not resemble people who love drugs for their smell and colour, but care not for them as anodynes or purges, and are not aware of those properties ?", "1680": "Whereas those who have more proficiency can derive benefit not from dis­ courses only, but from sights and actions, and cull what is good and useful, as is recorded of Æschylus and other similar kind of men.", "1681": "As to AEschylus, when he was watching a contest in boxing at the Isthmus, and the whole theatre cried out upon one of the boxers being beaten, he nudged with his elbow Ion of Chios, and said, \" Do you observe the power of training ?", "1682": "The beaten man holds his peace, while the spectators cry out.\"", "1683": "And Brasidas having caught hold of a mouse among some figs, being bitten by it let it go, and said to himself, \" Hercules, there is no creature so small or weak that it will not fight for its life !", "1684": "\"", "1685": "And Diogenes, seeing a lad drinking water out of the palm of his hand, threw away the cup which he kept in his wallet.", "1686": "So much does attention and assiduous practice make people perceptive and receptive of what contributes to virtue from any source.", "1687": "And this is the case still more with those who mix discourses with actions, who not only, to use the language of Thucydides,1 it exercise themselves in the presence of danger,\" but also in regard to pleasures and strifes, and judgements, and advocateships, and magis­ trateships make a display of their opinions, or rather form their opinions by their practice.", "1688": "For we can no more think those philosophers who are ever learning and busy and in­ vestigating what they have got from philosophy, and then straightway publish it in the market-place or in the haunt of young men, or at a royal supper-party, any more than we give the name of physicians to those who sell drugs and mixtures.", "1689": "Nay rather such a sophist differs very little at all from the bird described in Homer,2 offering his scholars like it whatever he has got, and as it feeds its callow young from its own mouth, \" though it goes ill with itself,\" so he gets no advantage or food from what he has got for himself.", "1690": "§ ix.", "1691": "We must therefore see to it that our discourse be serviceable to ourselves, and that it may not appear to others to be vain-glorious or ambitious, and we must show that we are as willing to listen as to teach, and especially must we lay aside all disputatiousness and love of strife in controversy, and cease bandying fierce words with one another as if we were contending with one another at boxing, and leave off rejoicing more in smiting and knock­ ing down one another than in learning and teaching.", "1692": "For in such cases moderation and mildness, and to commence arguing without quarrelsomeness and to finish without get­ ting into a rage, and neither to be insolent if you come off best in the argument, nor dejected if you come off worst, is a sufficient sign of progress in virtue.", "1693": "Aristippus was an ex­ cellent example of this, when overcome in argument by the sophistry of a man, who had plenty of assurance, but was generally speaking mad or balf-witted.", "1694": "Observing that he was in great joy and very puffed up at his victory, he said, \"I who have been vanquished in the argument shall have a better nights rest than my victor.\"", "1695": "We can also test ourselves in regard to public speaking, if we are not timid and do not shrink from speaking when a large audience has unexpectedly been got together, nor dejected when we have only a small one to harangue to, and if we do not, when we have to speak to the people or before some magistrate, miss the opportunity through want of proper preparation;", "1696": "for these things are recorded both of Demosthenes and Alci­ biades.", "1697": "As for Alcibiades, though he possessed a most excellent understanding, yet from want of confidence in speaking he often broke down, and in trying to recall a word or thought that slipped his memory had to stop short.", "1698": "1", "1699": "And Homer did not deny that his first line was unmetrical,2 though he had sufficient confidence to follow it up by so many other lines, so great was his genius.", "1700": "Much more then ought those who aim at virtue and what is noble to lose no opportunity of public speaking, paying very little attention to either uproar or applause at their speeches.", "1701": "§ x.", "1702": "And not only ought each to see to his discourses but also to his actions whether he regards utility more than show, and truth more than display.", "1703": "For if a genuine love for youth or maiden seeks no witnesses, but is con­ tent to enjoy its delights privately, far more does it become the philosopher and lover of the beautiful, who is con­ versant with virtue through his actions, to pride himself on his silence, and not to need people to praise or listen to him.", "1704": "As that man who called his maid in the house, and cried out to her, “ See, Dionysia, I am angry no longer,”3 so he that does anything agreeable and polite, and then goes and spreads it about the town, plainly shows that he looks for public applause and has a strong propensity to vain-glory, and as yet has no acquaintance with virtue as a reality but only as a dream, restlessly roving about amid phantoms and shadows, and making a display of whatever he does as painters display a picture.", "1705": "It is therefore a sign of progress in virtue not merely to have given to a friend or done a good turn to an acquaintance without mention­ ing it to other people, but also to have given an honest vote among many unjust ones, and to have withstood the dis­ honourable request of some rich man or of some man in office, and to have been above taking bribes, and, by Zeus, to have been thirsty all night and not to have drunk, or, like Agesilaus,1 to have resisted, though strongly tempted, the kiss of a handsome youth or maiden, and to have kept the fact to oneself and, been silent about it.", "1706": "For one's being satisfied with one's own good opinion2 and not despising it, but rejoicing in it and acquiescing in it as competent to see and decide on what is honourable, proves that reason is rooted and grounded within one, and that, to borrow the language of Democritus, one is accustomed to draw one's delights from oneself.", "1707": "And just as farmers behold with greater pleasure those ears of corn which bend and bow down to the ground, while they look upon those that from their lightness stand straight upright as empty pretenders, so also among those young men who wish to be philosophers those that are most empty and without any solidity show the greatest amount of assurance in their appearance and walk, and a face full of haughtiness and contempt that looks down on everybody, but when they begin to grow full and get some fruit from study they lay aside their proud and vain3 bearing.", "1708": "And just as in vessels that contain water the air is excluded, so with men that are full of solid merit their pride abates, and their estimate of themselves becomes a lower one, and they cease to plume themselves on a long beard and threadbare cloak,4 and transfer their training to the mind, and are most severe and austere to themselves, while they are milder in their intercourse with everybody else;", "1709": "and they do not as before eagerly snatch at the name and reputation of philosopher, nor do they write themselves down as such, but even if he were addressed by that title by anyone else, an ingenuous young man would say, smiling and blushing, \"I am not a god:", "1710": "why do you liken me to the immortals ? \"", "1711": "1 For as AEschylus says, \" I never can mistake the burning eye", "1712": "Of the young woman that has once known man,”2 so to the young man who has tasted of true progress in philo­ sophy the following lines of Sappho are applicable, \"My tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth, and a fire courses all over my lean body,\" and his eye will be gentle and mild, and you would desire to hear him speak.", "1713": "For as those who are initiated come together at first with confusion and noise and jostle one another, but when the mysteries are being performed and exhibited, they give their attention with awe and silence, so also at the commencement of philosophy you will see round its doors much confusion and assurance and prating, some rudely and violently jostling their way to reputation, but be who once enters in, and sees the great light, as when shrines are open to view, assumes another air and is silent and awe-struck, and in humility and decorum follows reason as if she were a god.", "1714": "And the playful remark of Menedemus seems to suit these very well.", "1715": "He said that the majority of those who went to school at Athens became first wise, and then philosophers, after that orators, and as time went on became ordinary kind of people, the more they had to do with learning, so much the more laying aside their pride and high estimate of themselves.§ XI.", "1716": "Of people that need the help of the physician some, if their tooth ache or even finger smart, run at once to the doctor, others if they are feverish send for one and implore his assistance at their own home, others who are melan­ choly or crazy or delirious will not sometimes even see the doctor if he comes to their house, but drive him away, or avoid him, ignorant through their grievous disease that they are diseased at all.", "1717": "Similarly of those who have done what is wrong some are incorrigible, being hostile and in­ dignant and furious at those who reprove and admonish them, while others are meeker and bear and allow reproof.", "1718": "Now, when one has done what is wrong, to offer one­ self for reproof, toexpose the case and reveal one's wrong­ doing, and not to rejoice if it lies hid, or be satisfied if it is not known, but to make confession of it and ask for inter­ ference and admonishment, is no small indication of pro­ gress in virtue.", "1719": "And so Diogenes said that one who wished to do what was right ought to seek either a good friend or red-hot enemy, that either by rebuke or mild entreaty he might flee from vice.", "1720": "But as long as anyone, making a display of dirt or stains on his clothes, or a torn shoe, prides himself to outsiders on his freedom from arrogance, and, by Zeus, thinks himself doing something very smart if be jeers at himself as a dwarf or hunchback, but wraps up and conceals as if they were ulcers the inner vileness of his soul and the deformities of his life, as his envy, his malignity, his littleness, his love of pleasure, and will not let anyone touch or look at them from fear of disgrace, such a one has made little progress in virtue, yea rather none.", "1721": "But he that joins issue with his vices, and shows that he himself is even more pained and grieved about them than anyone else, or, what is next best, is able and willing to listen patiently to the reproof of another and to correct his life accordingly, he seems truly to be disgusted at his depravity and resolute to divest himself of it.", "1722": "We ought certainly to be ashamed of and shun every appear­ ance of vice, but he who is more put about by his vice itself than by the bad reputation that ensues upon it, will not mind either hearing it spoken against or even speaking against it himself if it make him a better man.", "1723": "That was a witty remark of Diogenes to a young man, who when seen in a tavern retired into the kitchen :", "1724": "\"", "1725": "The more,\" said he, \"you retire, the more are you in the tavern.\"", "1726": "1", "1727": "Even so the more a vicious man denies his vice, the more does it insinuate itself and master him :", "1728": "as those people really poor who pretend to be rich get still more poor from their false display.", "1729": "But he who is really making progress in virtue imitates Hippocrates, who confessed publicly and put into black and white that he had made a mistake about the sutures of the skull,1 for he will think it monstrous, if that great man declared his mistake, that others might not fall into the same error, and yet he himself for his own deliverance from vice cannot bear to be shown he is in the wrong, and to confess his stupidity and ignorance.", "1730": "Moreover the sayings of Bion and Pyrrho will test not so much one's progress as a greater and more perfect habit of virtue.", "1731": "Bion maintained that his friends might think they had made progress, when they could listen as patiently to abuse as to such language as the following, \" Stranger, you look not like a bad or foolish person,\" 2 \" Health and joy go with you, may the gods give you happiness!\"", "1732": "8", "1733": "While as to Pyrrho they say, when he was at sea and in peril from a storm, that he pointed out a little pig that was quietly enjoying some grain that had been scattered about, and said to his companions that the man who did not wish to be disturbed by the changes and chances of life should attain a similar composedness of mind through reason and philosophy.", "1734": "§", "1735": "XII.", "1736": "Look also at the opinion of Zeno, who thought that everybody might gauge his progress in- virtue by his dreams, if he saw himself in his dreams pleasing himself with nothing disgraceful, and neither doing nor wishing to do anything dreadful or unjust, but that, as in the clear depths of a calm and tranquil sea, his fancy and passions were plainly shown to be under the control of reason.", "1737": "And this had not escaped the notice of Plato,4 it seems, who had earlier expressed in form and outline the part that fancy and unreason played in sleep in the soul that was by nature tyrannical, \" for it attempts incest,\" he says, \" with its mother, and procures for itself unlawful meats, and gives itself up to the most abandoned desires, such as in daytime the law through shame and fear debars people from.\"", "1738": "As then beasts of burden that have been well-trained do not, even if their driver let go the reins, attempt to turn aside and leave the proper road, but go forward orderly as usual, pursuing their way without stumbling, so those whose un­ reason has become obedient and mild and tempered by reason, will not easily wish, either in dreams or in illnesses, to deal insolently or lawlessly through their desires, but will keep to their usual habits, which acquire their power and force by attention.", "1739": "For if the body can by training make itself and its members so subject to control, that the eyes in sorrow can refrain from tears, and the heart from pal­ pitating in fear, and the passions can be calm in the presence of beautiful youths and maidens, is it not far more likely that the training of the passions and emotions of the soul will allay, tame down, and mould their propensities even in dreams ?", "1740": "A story is told about the philosopher Stilpo,l that he thought he saw in a dream Poseidon angry with him because he had not sacrificed an ox to him, as was usual among the Megarians:", "1741": "2 and that he, not a bit fright­ ened, said, \" What are you talking about, Poseidon ?", "1742": "Do you come here as a peevish boy, because I have not with borrowed money filled the town with the smell of sacrifice, and have only sacrificed to you out of what I had at home on a modest scale ? \"", "1743": "Then he thought that Poseidon smiled at him, and held out his right hand, and said that for his sake he would give the Megarians a large shoal of anchovies.", "1744": "Those, then, that have such pleasant, clear, and painless dreams, and no frightful, or harsh, or malignant, or untoward apparition, may be said to have reflections of their progress in virtue;", "1745": "whereas agitation and panics and ignoble flights, and boyish delights, and lamentations in the case of sad and strange dreams, are like the waves that break on the coast, the soul not having yet got its proper com­ posure, but being still in course of being moulded by opinions and laws, from which it escapes in dreams as far as possible, so that it is once again set free and open to the passions.", "1746": "Do you investigate all these points too, as to whether they are signs of progress in virtue, or of some.", "1747": "habit which has already a settled constancy and strength through reason.", "1748": "§ XIII.", "1749": "Now since entire freedom from the passions is a great and divine thing, and progress in virtue seems, as we say, to consist in a certain remissness and mildness of the passions, we must observe the passions both in them­ selves and in reference to one another to gauge the diffe­ rence :", "1750": "in themselves as to whether desire, and fear, and rage are less strong in us now than formerly, through our quickly extinguishing their violence and heat by reason;", "1751": "and in reference to one another as to whether we are ani­ mated now by modesty more than by fear, and by emulation more than by envy, and by love of glory rather than by love of riches, and generally speaking whether—to use the language of musicians-it is in the Dorian more than in the Lydian measures that we err either by excess or de­ ficiency,1 whether we are plainer in our manner of living or more luxurious, whether we are slower in action or quicker, whether we admire men and their discourses more than we should or despise them.", "1752": "For as it is a good sign in diseases if they turn aside from vital parts of the body, so in the case of people who are making progress in virtue, when vice seems to shift to milder passions, it is a sign it will soon die out.", "1753": "When Phrynis added to the seven chords two chords more, the Ephors asked him which he preferred to let them cut off, the upper or lower ones ;", "1754": "2 so we must cut off both above and below, if we mean to attain to the mean and to due proportion :", "1755": "for progress in virtue first diminishes the excess and sharpness of the passions, ‟ That sharpness for which madmen are so vehement,\" as Sophocles says.§ xiv.", "1756": "I have already said that it is a very great indica­ tion of progress in virtue to transfer our judgement to action, and not to let our words remain merely words, but to make deeds of them.", "1757": "A manifestation of this is in the first place emulation as regards what we praise, and a zeal to do what we admire, and an unwillingness either to do or allow what we censure.", "1758": "To illustrate my meaning by an example, it is probable that all Athenians praised the daring and bravery of Miltiades;", "1759": "but Themistocles alone said that the trophy of Miltiades would not let him sleep, but woke him up of a night, and not only praised and admired him, but manifestly emulated and imitated his glorious actions.", "1760": "Small, therefore, can we think the progress we have made, as long as our admiration for those who have done noble things is barren, and does not of itself incite us to imitate them.", "1761": "For as there is no strong love without jealousy, so there is no ardent and energetic praise of virtue, which does not prick and goad one on, and make one not envious but emulous of what is noble, and desirous to do something similar.", "1762": "For not only at the discourses of a philosopher ought we, as Alcibiades said,1 to be moved in heart and shed tears, but the true proficient in virtue, comparing his own deeds and actions with those of the good and perfect man, and grieved at the same time at the knowledge of his own deficiency, yet rejoicing in hope and desire, and full of impulses that will not let him rest, is, as Simonides says, \" Like sucking foal running by side of dam,\" a being desirous all but to coalesce with the good man.", "1763": "For it is a special sign of true progress in virtue to love and admire the disposition of those whose deeds we emulate, and to resemble them with a good-will that ever assigns due honour and praise to them.", "1764": "But whoever is steeped in contentiousness and envy against his betters, let him know that he may be pricked on by a jealous desire for glory or power, but that he neither honours nor admires virtue.", "1765": "§ xv.", "1766": "Whenever, then, we begin so much to love good men that we deem happy, \"not only,\" as Plato 3 says, \" the temperate man himself, but also the man who hears the words that flow from his wise lips,\" and even admire and are pleased with his figure and walk and look and smile, and desire to adapt ourselves to his model and to stick closely to him, then may we think that we are making genuine progress.", "1767": "Still more will this be the case, if we admire the good not only in prosperity, but like lovers who admire even the lispings and paleness of those in their flowery as the tears and dejection of Panthea in her grief and affliction won the affections of Araspes,2 so we fear neither the exile of Aristides, nor the prison of Anaxagoras, nor the poverty of Socrates, nor the condemnation of Phocion, but think virtue worthy our love even under such trials, and join her, ever chanting that line of Euripides, \" Unto the noble everything is good.\"", "1768": "3", "1769": "For the enthusiasm that can go so far as not to be dis­ couraged at the sure prospect of trouble, but admires and emulates what is good even so, could never be turned away from what is noble by anybody.", "1770": "Such men ever, whether they have some business to transact, or have taken upon them some office, or are in some critical conjuncture, put before their eyes the example of noble men, and consider what Plato would have done on the occasion, what Epaminondas would have said, how Lycurgus or Agesilaus would have dealt;", "1771": "that so, adjusting and re-modelling themselves, as it were, at their mirrors, they may correct any ignoble expression, and repress any ignoble passion.", "1772": "For as those that have learnt the names of the Idæan Dactyli4 make use of them to banish their fear by quietly repeating them over, so the bearing in mind and remembering good men, which soon suggests itself forcibly to those who have made some progress in virtue in all their emotions and difficulties, keeps them upright and not liable to fall.", "1773": "Let this also then be a sign to you of progress in virtue.", "1774": "§ xvi.", "1775": "In addition to this, not to be too much disturbed, nor to blush, nor to try and conceal oneself, or make any change in one's

Alexander, seeing a mes­ senger running up to him full of joy and holding out his right hand, said, \" My good friend, what are you going to tell me?", "1777": "Has Homer come to life again?\"",

same things, and directs and governs his life after one pattern, as becomes the noble lover of consistent friendship and familiarity.", "2030": "Such a person is a friend.", "2031": "But the flatterer having no fixed character of his own,2 and not seeking to lead the life suitable for him, but shaping and modelling himself after another's pattern, is neither simple nor uni­ form, but complex and unstable, assuming different appear­ ances, like water poured from vessel to vessel, ever in a state of flux and accommodating himself entirely to the fashion of those who entertain him.", "2032": "The ape indeed, as it seems, attempting to imitate man, is caught imitating his movements and dancing like him, but the flatterer himself attracts and decoys other men, imitating not all alike, for with one he sings and dances, with another he wrestles and gets covered with the dust of the palæstra, while he follows a third fond of hunting and the chase all but shouting out the words of Phædra, \" How I desire to halloo on the dogs, Chasing the dappled deer,\"1 and yet he has really no interest in the chase, it is the hunter himself he sets the toils and snares for.", "2033": "And if the object of his pursuit is some young scholar and lover of learning, he is all for books then, his beard flows down to his feet,!", "2034": "he's quite a sight with his threadbare cloak, has all the indifference of the Stoic, and speaks of nothing but the rectangles and triangles of Plato.", "2035": "But if any rich and careless fellow fond of drink come in his way, “Then wise Odysseus stript him of his rags,\"* his threadbare cloak is thrown aside, his beard is shorn off like a fruitless crop, he goes in for wine-coolers and tankards, and laughs loudly in the streets, and jeers at philosophers.", "2036": "As they say happened at Syracuse, when Plato went there, and Dionysius was seized with a furious passion for philo­ sophy, and so great was the concourse of geometricians that they raised up quite a cloud of dust in the palace, but when Plato fell out of favour, and Dionysius gave up philosophy, and went back again headlong to wine and women and trifles and debauchery, then all the court was metamorphosed, as if they all had drunk of Circe's cup, for ignorance and oblivion and silliness reigned rampant.", "2037": "I am borne out in what I say by the behaviour of great flatterers and demagogues, the greatest of whom Alcibiades, a jeerer and horse-rearer at Athens, and living a gay and merry life, wore his hair closely shaven at Lacedæmon, and washed in cold water, and attired himself in a threadbare cloak;", "2038": "while in Thrace he fought5 and drank;", "2039": "and at Tissaphernes' court lived delicately and luxuriously and in a pretentious style;", "2040": "and thus curried favour and was popular with everybody by imitating their habits and ways.", "2041": "Such was not the way however in which Epaminondas or Agesilaus acted, for though they associated with very many men and states and different modes of life, they maintained everywhere their usual demeanour, both in dress and diet and language and behaviour.", "2042": "So Plato1 at Syracnse was exactly the same man as in the Academy, the same with Dionysius as with Dion.§ VIII.", "2043": "As to the changes of the flatterer, which resemble those of the polypus,2 a man may most easily detect them by himself pretending to change about frequently, and by censuring the kind of life he used formerly to praise, and anon approving of the words actions and modes of life that he used to be displeased with.", "2044": "He will then see that the .", "2045": "flatterer is never consistent or himself, never loving hating rejoicing grieving at his own initiative, but like a mirror, merely reflecting the image of other people's emotions and manners and feelings.", "2046": "Such a one will say, if you censure one of your friends to him, \"You are slow in finding the fellow out, he never pleased me from the first.\"", "2047": "But if on the other hand you change your language and praise him, he will swear by Zeus that he rejoices at it, and is himself under obligations to the man, and believes in him.", "2048": "And if you talk of the necessity of changing your mode of life, of retiring from public life to a life of privacy and ease, he says, \" We ought long ago to have got rid of uproar3 and envy.\"", "2049": "But if you think of returning again to public life, he chimes in, \" Your sentiments do you honour:", "2050": "retire­ ment from business is pleasant, but inglorious and mean.\"", "2051": "One ought to say at once to such a one, \" ' Stranger, quite different now you look to what you did before.’4", "2052": "I do not need a friend to change his opinions with me and to assent to me in everything, my shadow will do that better, but I need one that will speak the truth and help me with his judgement.\"", "2053": "This is one way of detecting the flatterer.", "2054": "§ ix.", "2055": "We must also observe another difference in the resemblance between the friend and flatterer.", "2056": "The true friend does not imitate you in everything, nor is he too keen to praise, but praises only what is excellent, for as Sophocles says, \"He is not born to share in hate but love,”1 yes, by Zeus, and he is born to share in doing what is right and in loving what is noble, and not to share in wrong-doing or misbehaviour, unless it be that, as a running of the eyes is catching, so through companionship and intimacy be may against his will contract by infection some vice or in habit, as they say Plato's intimates imitated his stoop, Aristotle's his lisp, and king Alexander's his holding his head a little on one side, and rapidity of utterance in con­ versation,2 for people mostly pick up unawares such traits of character.", "2057": "But the flatterer is exactly like the chameleon,3 which takes every colour but white, and so he, though unable to imitate what is worth his while, leaves nothing that is bad unimitated.", "2058": "And just as poor painters unable to make a fine portrait from inefficiency in their craft, bring out the likeness by painting all the wrinkles, moles and scars, so the flatterer imitates his friend's intemperance, superstition, hot temper, sourness to domestics, suspicion of his friends and relations.", "2059": "For he is by nature inclined to what is worst, and thinks that imitation of what is bad is as far as possible removed from censure.", "2060": "For those are suspected who have noble aims in life, and seem to be vexed and dis­ gusted at their friends' faults, for that injured and even ruined Dion with Dionysius, Samins with Philip, and Cleo­ menes with Ptolemy.", "2061": "But he that wishes to be and appear at the same time both agreeable and trustworthy pretends to rejoice more in what is bad, as being through excessive love for his friend not even offended at his vices, but as one with him in feeling and nature in all matters.", "2062": "And so they claim to share in involuntary and chance ailments, and pretend to have the same complaints, in flattery to those who suffer from any, as that their eyesight and sense of hearing are deficient, if their friends are somewhat blind or deaf, as the flatterers of Dionysius, who was rather short- sighted, jostled one another at a dinner party, and knocked the dishes off the table, as if from defect of vision.", "2063": "1", "2064": "And some to make their cases more similar wind themselves in closer, and dive even into family secrets for parallels.", "2065": "For seeing that their friends are unfortunate in marriage, or suspicions about the behaviour of their sons or relations, they do not spare themselves, but make quite a Jeremiad about their own sons, or wife, or kinsfolk, or relations, pro­ claiming loudly their own family secrets.", "2066": "For similarity in situation makes people more sympathetic, and their friends having received as it were hostages by their con­ fessions, entrust them in return with their secrets, and having once made confidants of them, dare not take back their confidence.", "2067": "2", "2068": "I actually know of a man who turned his wife out of doors because his friend had put away his;", "2069": "but as he secretly visited her and sent messages to her, he was detected by his friend's wife noticing his conduct.", "2070": "So little did he know the nature of a flatterer that thought the following lines more applicable to a crab than a flatterer, \" His whole body is belly, his eye is on every­ thing, he is a creature creeping on his teeth,\" for such is a true picture of the parasite, \" friends of the frying-pan, hunting for a dinner,\" to borrow the language of Eupolis.§ x. However let us put off all this to its proper place in the discourse.", "2071": "But let us not fail to notice the wiliness of the flatterer's imitation, in that, even if he imitates any good points in the person he flatters, he always takes care to give him the palm.", "2072": "Whereas among real friends there is no rivalry or jealousy of one another, but they are satisfied and contented alike whether they are equal or one of them is superior.", "2073": "But the flatterer, ever remembering that he is to play second fiddle,1 makes his copy always fall a little short of the original, for he admits that he is everywhere outstripped and left behind, except in vice.", "2074": "For in that alone he claims pre-eminence, for if his friend is peevish, he says he is atrabilious;", "2075": "if his friend is superstitious, he says he is a fanatic ;", "2076": "if his friend is in love, he says he is madly in love;", "2077": "if his friend laughs, he will say, \"You laughed a little unseasonably, but I almost died of laughter.\"", "2078": "But in regard to any good points his action is quite the oppo­ site.", "2079": "He says he can run quickly, but his friend flies;", "2080": "he says he can ride pretty well, but his friend is a Centaur on horseback.", "2081": "He says \" I am not a bad poet, and don't write very bad lines, “‘But your sonorous verse is like Jove'a thunder.'\"", "2082": "Thus he shows at once that his friend's aims in life are good, and that his friend has reached a height he cannot soar to.", "2083": "Such then are the differences in the resemblances between the flatterer and the friend.", "2084": "§ xi.", "2085": "But since, as has been said before, to give plea­ sure is common to both, for the good man delights in his friends as much as the bad man in his flatterers, let us con­ sider the difference between them here too.", "2086": "The difference lies in the different aim of each in giving pleasure.", "2087": "Look at it this way.", "2088": "There is no doubt a sweet smell in per­ fume.", "2089": "So there is also in medicine.", "2090": "But the difference is that while in perfume pleasure and nothing else is de­ signed, in medicine either purging, or warming, or adding flesh to the system, is the primary object, and the sweet smell is only a secondary consideration.", "2091": "Again painters mix gay colours and dyes:", "2092": "there are also some drugs which are gay in appearance and not unpleasing in colour.", "2093": "What then is the difference between these ?", "2094": "Manifestly we dis­ tinguish by the end each aims at.", "2095": "So too the social life of friends employs mirth to add a charm to some good and useful end, and sometimes makes joking and a good table and wine, aye, and even chaff and banter, the seasoning to noble and serious matters, as in the line, \" Much they enjoyed talking to one another,”1 and again, \" Never did ought else Disturb our love or joy in one another.\"", "2096": "2", "2097": "But the flatterer's whole aim and end is to cook up and season his joke or word or action, so as to produce pleasure.", "2098": "And to speak concisely, the flatterer's object is to please in everything he does, whereas the true friend always does what is right, and so often gives pleasure, often pain, not wishing the latter, but not shunning it either, if he deems it best.", "2099": "For as the physician, if it be expedient, infuses saffron or spikenard, aye, or uses some soothing fomenta­ tion or feeds his patient up liberally, and sometimes orders castor, \" Or poley,3 that so strong and foully smells,\" or pounds hellebore and compels him to drink it,-neither in the one case making unpleasantness, nor in the other pleasantness, his end and aim, but in both studying only the interest of his patient,-so the friend sometimes by praise and kindness, extolling him and gladdening his heart, leads him to what is noble, as Agamemnon, \"Teucer, dear head, thou son of Telamon, Go on thus shooting, captain of thy men ;", "2100": "”4 or Diomede, \" How could I e'er forget divine Odysseus ? \"5 But where on the other hand there is need of correction, then he rebukes with biting words and with the freedom worthy of a friend, \" Zeus-cherished Menelaus, art thou mad, And in thy folly tak'st no heed of safety ?", "2101": "\"", "2102": "6 Sometimes also he joins action to word, as Menedemus sobered the profligate and disorderly son of his friend Asclepiades, by shutting him out of his house, and not speaking to him.", "2103": "And Arcesilaus forbade Bato his school, when he wrote a line in one of his plays against Cleanthes, and only got reconciled with him after he repented and made his peace with Cleanthes.", "2104": "For we ought to give our friend pain if it will benefit him, but not to the extent of breaking off our friendship;", "2105": "but just as we make use of some biting medicine, that will save and preserve the life of the patient.", "2106": "And so the friend, like a musician, in bringing about an improvement to what is good and ex­ pedient, sometimes slackens the chords, sometimes tightens them, and is often pleasant, but always useful.", "2107": "But the flatterer, always harping on one note, and accustomed to play his accompaniment only with a view to please and to ingratiate himself, knows not how either to oppose in deed, or give pain in word, but complies only with every wish, ever chiming in with and echoing the senti­ ments of his patron.", "2108": "As then Xenophon says Agesilaus took pleasure in being praised by those who would also censure him,l so ought we to think that to please and gratify us is friendly in the person who can also give us pain and oppose us, but to feel suspicion at an intercourse which is merely for pleasure and gratification, and never pungent, aye and by Zeus to have ready that saying of the Lacedæmonian, who, on hearing king Charillus praised, said, \" How can he be a good man, who is not severe even to the bad ?", "2109": "\"§ XII.", "2110": "They say the gadfly attacks bulls, and the tick dogs, in the ear:", "2111": "so the flatterer besieges with praise the ears of those who are fond of praise, and sticks there and is hard to dislodge.", "2112": "We ought therefore here to make a wide-awake and careful discrimination, whether the praise is bestowed on the action or the man.", "2113": "It is bestowed on the action, if people praise the absent rather than the present, if also those that have the same aims and aspirations praise not only us but all that are similarly disposed, and do not evidently say and do one thing at one time, and the direct contrary at another;", "2114": "and the greatest test is if we are conscious, in the matters for which we get the praise, that we have not regretted them, and are not ashamed at them, and would not rather have said and done differently.", "2115": "For our own inward judgement, testifying the contrary and not admitting the praise, is above passion, and impregnable and proof against the flatterer.", "2116": "But I know not how it is that most people in misfortune cannot bear exhortation, but are captivated more by condolence and sympathy, and when they have done something wrong and acted amiss, he that by censure and blame implants in them the stings of repentance is looked upon by them as hostile and an accuser, while they welcome and regard as friendly and well-dis­ posed to them the person who bestows praise and pane­ gyric on what they have done.", "2117": "Those then that readily praise and join in applauding some word or action on the part of someone whether in jest or earnest, only do temporary harm for the moment, but those who injure the character by their praise, aye, and by their flattery undermine the morals, act like those slaves who do not steal from the bin, but from the seed corn.", "2118": "1", "2119": "For they pervert the disposition, which is the seed of actions, and the character, which is the principle and fountain of life, by attaching to vice names that belong properly only to virtue.", "2120": "For as Thucy­ dides says,2 in times of faction and war people change the accustomed meaning of words as applied to acts at their will and pleasure, for reckless daring is then con­ sidered bravery to one's comrades, and prudent delay specious cowardice, and sober-mindedness the cloak of the coward, and taking everything into account before action a real desire to do nothing.\"", "2121": "So too in the case of flattery we must observe and be on our guard against wastefulness being called liberality, and cowardliness pru­ dence, and madness quick-wittedness, and meanness fru­ gality, and the amorous man called social and affectionate, and the term manly applied to the passionate and vain man, and the term civil applied to the paltry and mean man.", "2122": "As I remember Plato3 says the lover is a flatterer of the beloved one, and calls the snub nose graceful, and the aquiline nose royal, and swarthy people manly, and fair people the children of the gods, and the olive complexion is merely the lover's phrase to gloss over and palliate excessive pallor.", "2123": "And yet the ugly man persuaded he is handsome, or the short man persuaded he is tall, cannot long remain in the error, and receives only slight injury from it, and not irreparable mischief:", "2124": "but praise applied to vices as if they were virtues, so that one is not vexed but delighted with a vicious life, removes all shame from wrong­ doing, and was the ruin of the Sicilians, by calling the savage cruelty of Dionysius and Phalaris detestation of wickedness and uprightness.", "2125": "It was the ruin of Egypt, by styling Ptolemy's effeminacy, and superstition, and bowlings, and beating of drums, religion and service to the gods.", "2126": "1", "2127": "It was nearly the overthrow and destruction of the ancient manners of the Romans, palliating the luxury and intemperance and display of Antony as exhibitions of jollity and kindliness, when his power and fortune were at their zenith.", "2128": "What else invested Ptolemy3 with his pipe and fiddle ?", "2129": "What else brought Nero3 on the tragic stage, and invested him with the mask and buskins ?", "2130": "Was it not the praise of flatterers ?", "2131": "And are not many kings called Apollos if they can just sing a song,4 and Dionysuses if they get drunk, and Herculeses if they can wrestle, and do they not joy in such titles, and are they not dragged into every kind of disgrace by flattery ?§ XIII.", "2132": "Wherefore we must be especially on our guard against the flatterer in regard to praise;", "2133": "as indeed he is very well aware himself, and clever to avoid suspicion.", "2134": "If he light upon some dandy, or rustic in a thick leather garment, he treats him with nothing but jeers and mocks,5 as Struthias insulted Bias, ironically praising him for his stupidity, saying, \"You have drunk more than king Alex- ander,”1 and, it that he was ready to die of laughing at his tale about the Cyprian.”", "2135": "2", "2136": "But when he sees people more refined very much on their guard, and observing both time and place, he does not praise them directly, but draws off a little and wheels round and approaches them noiselessly, as one tries to catch a wild animal.", "2137": "For sometimes he reports to a man the panegyric of other persons upon him, (as orators do, introducing some third person,) saying that he had a very pleasant conversation in the market with some strangers and men of worth, who mentioned how they admired his many good points.", "2138": "On another occasion he concocts and fabricates some false and trifling charges against him, pretending he has heard them from other people, and runs up with a serious face and inquires, where he said or did such and such a thing.", "2139": "And upon his deny­ ing he ever did, he pounces on him at once3 and com­ pliments his man with, \" I thought it strange that you.", "2140": "should have spoken ill of your friends, seeing that you don't even treat your enemies so:", "2141": "and that you should have tried to rob other people, seeing that you are so lavish with your own money.\"", "2142": "A§ xiv.", "2143": "Other flatterers again, just as painters heighten the effect of their pictures by the combination of light and shade, so by censure abuse detraction and ridicule of the opposite virtues secretly praise and foment the actual vices of those they flatter.", "2144": "Thus they censure modesty as merely rustic behaviour in the company of profligates, and greedy people, and villains, and such as have got rich by evil and dishonourable courses;", "2145": "and contentment and uprightness they call having no spirit or energy in action;", "2146": "and when they associate with lazy and idle persons who avoid all public duties, they are not ashamed to call the life of a citizen wearisome meddling in other people's affairs, and the desire to bold office fruitless vain-glory.", "2147": "And some ere now to flatter an orator have depreciated a philosopher, and others won favour with wanton women by traducing those wives who are faithful to their husbands as constitutionally cold and country bred.", "2148": "And by an acme of villainy flatterers do not always spare even themselves.", "2149": "For as wrestlers stoop that they may the easier give their adversaries a fall, so by censuring themselves they glide into praising others.", "2150": "\" I am a cowardly slave,\" says such a one, \" at sea, I shirk labour, I am madly in rage if a word is said against me ;", "2151": "but this man fears nothing, has no vices, is a rare good fellow, patient and easy in all circumstances.”", "2152": "But if a person has an excellent idea of his own good sense, and desires to be austere and self-opinionated, and in his moral rectitude is ever spouting that line of Homer, \" Tydides, neither praise nor blame me much,”1 the artistic flatterer does not attack him as he attacked others, but employs against such a one a new device.", "2153": "For he comes to him about his own private affairs, as if desirous to have the advice of one wiser than himself;", "2154": "he has, he says, more intimate friends, but he is obliged to trouble him ;", "2155": "\"for whither shall we that are deficient in judgement go ? whom shall we trust?\"", "2156": "And having listened to his utterance he departs, saying he has received an oracle not an opinion.", "2157": "And if he notices that somebody lays claim to experience in oratory, he gives him some of his writings, and begs him to read and correct them.", "2158": "So, when king Mithri­ dates took a fancy to play the surgeon, several of his friends offered themselves for operating upon, as for cutting or cauterizing, flattering in deed and not in word, for his being credited by them would seem to prove his skill.2 \" For Providence has many different aspects.\"", "2159": "3 But .", "2160": "we can test this kind of negative praise, that needs more wary caution, by purposely giving strange advice and suggestions, and by adopting absurd corrections.", "2161": "For if he raises no objection but nods assent to everything, and approves of everything, and is always crying out, \" Good!", "2162": "How admirable !", "2163": "\" he is evidently “Asking advice, but seeking something else,\" wishing by praise to puff you up.§ xv.", "2164": "Moreover, as some have defined painting to be silent poetry,1 so is there praise in silent flattery.", "2165": "For as hunters are more likely to catch the objects of their chase unawares, if they do not openly appear to be so engaged, but seem to be walking, or tending their sheep, or looking after the farm, so flatterers obtain most success in their praise, when they do not seem to be praising but to be doing something else.", "2166": "For he who gives up his place or seat to the great man when he comes in, and while making a speech to the people or senate breaks off even in the middle, if he observes any rich man wants to speak, and gives up to him alike speech and platform, shows by his silence even more than he would by any amount of vocife­ ration that he thinks the other the better man, and superior to him in judgement.", "2167": "And consequently you may always see them occupying the best places at theatres and public assembly rooms, not that they think themselves worthy of them, but that they may flatter the rich by giving up their places to them ;", "2168": "and at public meetings they begin speaking first, and then make way as for better men, and most readily take back their own view, if any influential or rich or famous person espouse the contrary view.", "2169": "And so one can see plainly that all such servility and drawing back on their part is a lowering their sails, not to experience or virtue or age, but to wealth and fame.", "2170": "Not so Apelles the famous painter, who, when Megabyzus sat with him, and wished to talk about lines and shades, said to him, \" Do you see my lads yonder grinding colours, they admired just now your purple and gold, but now they are laughing at you for beginning to talk about what you don't under­ stand.\"", "2171": "2 And Solon, when Crœsus asked him about happiness, replied that Tellus, an obscure Athenian, and Bito and Cleobis were happier than he was.", "2172": "3", "2173": "But flatterers proclaim kings and rich men and rulers not only happy and fortunate, but also pre-eminent for wisdom, and art, and every virtue.", "2174": "^§ XVI.", "2175": "Now some cannot bear to hear the assertion of the Stoics1 that the wise man is at once rich, and hand­ some, and noble, and a king;", "2176": "but flatterers declare that the rich man is at once orator and poet, and (if he likes) painter, and flute-player, and swift-footed, and strong, falling down if he wrestles with them, and if contending with him in running letting him win the race, as Crisso of Himera purposely allowed Alexander to outrun him, which vexed the king very much when he heard of it.", "2177": "2", "2178": "And Carneades said that the sons of rich men and kings learnt nothing really well and properly except how to ride, for their master praised and flattered them in their studies, and the person who taught them wrestling always let them throw him, whereas the horse, not knowing or caring whether his rider were a private person or ruler, rich or poor, soon threw him over his head if he could not ride well.", "2179": "Simple therefore and fatuous was that remark of Bion, \" If you could by encomiums make your field to yield well and be fruitful, you could not be thought wrong in tilling it so rather than digging it and labouring in it:", "2180": "nor would it be strange in you to praise human beings if by so doing you could be useful and serviceable to them.\"",

Pelion, but let that alone, so ought the flatterer, tricked out and modelled in the distinctive marks and tokens of the friend, to leave untouched and uncopied only his outspokenness, as the special burden of friendship, \"heavy, huge, strong.”3", "2186": "But since flatterers, to avoid the blame they incur by their buffoonery, and drinking, and gibes, and jokes, sometimes work their ends by

comes on the stage not with a club stout and strong, but with a light and hollow cane, so the outspoken­ ness of the flatterer is to those who experience it mild and soft, and the very reverse of vigorous, and like those cushions for women's heads, which seem able to stand their ground, but in reality yield and give way under their pressure;", "2190": "so this sham outspokenness is puffed up and inflated with an empty and spurious and hollow bombast, that when it contracts and collapses draws in the person who relies on it.", "2191": "For true and friendly outspoken­ ness attacks

"But we will speak of this anon.2", "2193": "But the flatterer first exhibits himself as disagreeable and passionate and unforgiving in his dealings with others.", "2194": "For he is harsh to his servants, and a terrible fellow to attack and ferret out the faults of his kinsmen and friends, and to look up to and respect nobody who is a stranger, but to look down upon them, and is relentless and mischief- making in making people provoked with others, hunting after the reputation of hating vice, as one not likely knowingly to mince matters with the vicious, or ingratiate himself with them either in word or deed.", "2195": "Next he pretends to know nothing of real and great crimes, but he is a terrible fellow to inveigh against trifling and external shortcomings, and to fasten on them with intensity and vehemence, as if he sees any pot or pipkin out of its place, or anyone badly housed, or neglecting his beard or attire, or not adequately attend­ ing to a horse or dog.", "2196": "But contempt of parents, and neg­ lect of children, and bad treatment of wife, and haughtiness to friends, and throwing away money, all this he cares nothing about, but is silent and does not dare to make any allusion to it:", "2197": "just as if the trainer in a gymnasium were to allow the athlete to get drunk and live in debauchery,3 and yet be vexed at the condition of his oil-flask or strigil

beating people to death.", "2202": "1", "2203": "Just as if, when a man has tumours and fistulas, one were to cut his hair and nails with a surgeon's knife, so flatterers use outspokenness only in cases where it gives no pain or distress.", "2204": "§ XVIII.", "2205": "Moreover some of them are cleverer still and make their outspokenness and censure a means of impart­ ing pleasure.", "2206": "As Agis the Argive,2 when Alexander be­ stowed great gifts on a buffoon, cried out in envy and dis­ pleasure, “What a piece of absurdity! \" and on the king turning angrily to him and saying, \" What are you talking about ? \" he replied, \" I admit that I am vexed and put out, when I see that all you descendants of Zeus alike take de­ light in flatterers and jesters, for Hercules had his Cercopes, and Dionysus his Sileni, and with you too I see that such are held in good repute.\"", "2207": "And on one occasion, when the Emperor TLberius entered the senate, one of his flatterers got up and said, that being free men they ought to be out­ spoken, and not suppress or conceal anything that might be important, and having by this exordium engaged every­ body's attention, a dead silence prevailing, and even Tibe­ rius being all attention, he said, \" Listen, Cœsar, to what we all charge you with, although no one ventures to tell you openly of it;", "2208": "you neglect yourself, and are careless about your health, and wear yourself out with anxiety and labour on our behalf, taking no rest either by night or day.\"", "2209": "And on his stringing much more together in the same strain, they say the orator Cassius Severus said, \"This outspokenness will ruin the man.\"§ xix.", "2210": "These are indeed trifling matters :", "2211": "but the follow­ ing are more important and do mischief to foolish people, when flatterers accuse them of the very contrary vices and passions to those to which they are really addicted;", "2212": "as Himerius the flatterer twitted a very rich, very mean, and very covetous Athenian with being a careless spendthrift, and likely one day to want bread as well as his children;", "2213": "or on the other hand if they rail at extravagant spendthrifts for mean­ ness and sordidness, as Titus Petronius railed at Nero;", "2214": "or ex­ hort rulers who make savage and cruel attacks on their sub­ jects to lay aside their excessive clemency, and unseasonable and inexpedient mercy.", "2215": "Similar to these is the person who pretends to be on his guard against and afraid of a silly stupid fellow as if he were clever and cunning;", "2216": "and the one who, if any person fond of detraction, rejoicing in defa­ mation and censure, should be induced on any occasion to praise some man of note, fastens on him and alleges against him that he has an itch for praising people.", "2217": "“", "2218": "You are always extolling people of no merit:", "2219": "for who is this fellow, or what has he said or done out of the common ? \"", "2220": "But it is in regard to the objects of their love that they mostly attack those they flatter, and additionally inflame them.", "2221": "For if they see people at variance with their brothers, or despising their parents, or treating their wives contemp­ tuously, they neither take them to task nor scold them, but fan the flame of their anger still more. \"", "2222": "You don't suffi­ ciently appreciate yourself,\" they say, \"you are yourself the cause of your being put upon in this way, through your constant submissiveness and humility.\"", "2223": "And if there is any tiff or fit of jealousy in regard to some courtesan or adulteress, the flatterer is at hand with remarkable out­ spokenness, adding fuel to flame,1 and taking the lady's part, and accusing her lover of acting in a very unkind harsh and shameful manner to her, “0 ingrate, after all those frequent kisses !\"", "2224": "1 Thus Antony's friends, when he was passionately in love with the Egyptian woman,2 persuaded him that he was loved by her, and twitted him with being cold and haughty to her.", "2225": "\" She,\" they said, \" has left her mighty kingdom and happy mode of life, and is wasting her beauty, taking the field with you like some camp-follower, \" The while your heart is proof 'gainst all her charms,”3 as you neglect her love-lorn as she is.\"", "2226": "But he that is pleased at being reproached with his wrong-doing, and delights in those that censure him, as he never did in those that praised him, is unconscious that he is really perverted also by what seems to be rebuke.", "2227": "For such outspoken­ ness is like the bites of wanton women,4 that while seeming to hurt really tickle and excite pleasure.", "2228": "And just as if people mix pure wine, which is by itself an antidote against hemlock, with it and so offer it, they make the poison quite deadly, being rapidly carried to the heart by the warmth,5 so ill-disposed men, knowing that outspokenness is a great antidote to flattery, make it a means of flattering.", "2229": "And so it was rather a bad answer Bias6 made, to the person who inquired what was the most formidable animal, \" Of wild animals the tyrant, and of tame the flatterer.\"", "2230": "For it would have been truer to observe that tame flatterers are those that are found round the baths and table, but the one that intrudes into the interior of the house and into the women's apartments with his curiosity and calumny and malignity, like the legs and arms of the polypus, is wild and savage and unmanageable.§ xx.", "2231": "Now one kind of caution against his snares is to know and ever remember that, whereas the soul contains true and noble and reasoning elements, as also unreasoning and false and emotional ones, the friend is always a coun­ sellor and adviser to the better instincts of the soul, as the physician improves and maintains health, whereas the flatterer works upon the emotional and unreasoning ones, and tickles and titillates them and seduces them from reason, employing sensuality as his bait.", "2232": "As then there are some kinds of food which neither benefit the blood or spirit, nor brace up the nerves and marrow, but stir the passions, excite the lower nature, and make the flesh un­ sound and rotten, so the language of the flatterer adds nothing to soberness and reason, but encourages some love passion, or stirs up foolish rage, or incites to envy, or produces the empty and burdensome vanity of pride, or joins in bewailing woes, or ever by his calumnies and hints makes malignity and illiberality and suspicion sharp and timid and jealous, and cannot fail to be detected by those that closely observe him.", "2233": "For he is ever anchoring himself upon some passion, and fattening it, and, like a bubo, fastens himself on some unsound and inflamed parts of the soul.", "2234": "Are you angry ?", "2235": "Have your revenge, says he.", "2236": "Do you desire anything ?", "2237": "Get it.", "2238": "Are you afraid ?", "2239": "Let us flee.", "2240": "Do you suspect?", "2241": "Entertain no doubts about it.", "2242": "But if he is difficult to detect in thus playing upon our passions, since they often overthrow reason by their in­ tensity and strength, he will give a handle to find him out in smaller matters, being consistent in them too.", "2243": "For if anyone feels a little uneasy after a surfeit or excess in drink, and so is a little particular about his food and doubts the advisability of taking a bath, a friend will try and check him from excess, and bid him be careful and not indulge, whereas the flatterer will drag him to the bath, bid him serve up some fresh food, and not starve himself and so injure his constitution.", "2244": "And if he see him reluctant about a journey or voyage or some business or other, he will say that there is no hurry, that it's all one whether the business be put off, or somebody else despatched to look after it.", "2245": "And if you have promised to lend or give some money to a friend, but have repented of your offer, and yet feel ashamed not to keep your promise, the flatterer will throw his influence into the worse scale, he will confirm your desire to save your purse, he will destroy your reluctance, and will bid you be careful as having many expenses, and others to think about besides that person.", "2246": "And so, unless we are entirely ignorant of our desires, our shamelessness, and our timidity, the flatterer cannot easily escape our detection.", "2247": "For he is ever the advocate of those passions, and outspoken when we desire to repress them.", "2248": "1", "2249": "But so much for this matter.§ xxi.", "2250": "Now let us pass on to useful and kind services, for in them too the flatterer makes it very difficult and confusing to detect him from the friend, seeming to be zealous and ready on all occasions and never crying off.", "2251": "For, as Euripides says,2 a friend's behaviour is, \" like the utterance of truth, simple,\" and plain and inartificial, while that of the flatterer “is is in itself unsound, and needs wise remedies,\" aye, by Zeus, and many such, and not ordinary ones.", "2252": "As for example in chance meetings the friend often neither speaks nor is spoken to, but merely looks and smiles, and then passes on, showing his inner affection and good­ will only by his countenance, which his friend also re­ ciprocates, but the flatterer runs up, follows, holds out his hand at a distance, and if he is seen and addressed first, frequently protests with oaths, and calls witnesses to prove, that he did not see you.", "2253": "So in business friends neglect many unimportant points, are not too punctilious and officious, and do not thrust themselves upon every service, but the flatterer is persevering and unceasing and in­ defatigable in it, giving nobody else either room or place to help, but putting himself wholly at your disposal, and if you will not find him something to do for you, he is troubled, nay rather altogether dejected and lamenting loudly.", "2254": "3§ XXII.", "2255": "To all sensible people all this is an indication, not of true or sober friendship, but of a meretricious one, that embraces you more warmly than there is any occasion for.", "2256": "Nevertheless let us first look at the difference between the friend and flatterer in their promises.", "2257": "For it has been well said by those who have handled this subject before us, that the friend's promise is, \"If I can do it, and 'tis to be done,\" but the flatterer's is, “Speak out your mind, whatever it is, to me.”1", "2258": "And the comic dramatists put such fellows on the stage, “Nicomachus, pit me against that soldier, See if I beat him not into a jelly, And make his face e'en softer than a sponge.\"", "2259": "2", "2260": "In the next place no friend participates in any matter, unless he has first been asked his advice, and put the matter to the test, and set it on a suitable and expedient basis.", "2261": "But the flatterer, if anyone allows him to examine a matter and give his opinion on it, not only wishes to gratify him by compliance, but also fearing to be looked upon with suspicion as unwilling and reluctant to en­ gage in the business, gives in to and even urges on his friend's desire.", "2262": "For there is hardly any king or rich man who would say, “0 that a beggar I could find, or worse Than beggar, if, with good intent to me, He would lay bare his heart boldly and honestly ;", "2263": "”3 but, like the tragedians, they require a chorus of sympa­ thizing friends, or the applause of a theatre.", "2264": "And so Merope gives the following advice in the tragedy, “Choose you for friends those who will speak their mind, For those bad men that only speak to please See that you bolt and bar out of your house.”", "2265": "4", "2266": "But they act just the contrary, for they turn away with horror from those who speak their mind, and hold different views as to what is expedient, while they welcome those bad and illiberal impostors (that only speak to please them) not only within their houses, but also to their affections and secrets.", "2267": "Now the simpler of these do not think right or claim to advise you in important matters, but only to assist in the carrying out of them :", "2268": "but the more cunning one stands by during the discussion, and knits his brows, and nods assent with his head, but says nothing, but if his friend express an opinion, he then says, \" Hercules, you only just anticipated me, I was about to make that very remark.\"", "2269": "For as the mathematicians tell us that surfaces and lines neither bend nor extend nor move of themselves, being without body and only perceived by the mind, but only bend and extend and change their position with the bodies whose extremities they are:", "2270": "so you will catch the flatterer ever assenting with, and agreeing with, aye, and feeling with, and being angry with, another, so easy of detection in all these points of view is the difference between the friend and the flatterer.", "2271": "Moreover as regards the kind of good service.", "2272": "For the favour done by a friend, as the principal strength of an animal is within, is not for display or ostentation, but frequently as a doctor cures his patient imperceptibly, so a friend benefits by his interven­ tion, or by paying off creditors, or by managing his friend's affairs, even though the person who receives the benefit may not be aware of it.", "2273": "Such was the behaviour of Arcesilaus on various occasions, and when Apelles1 of Chios was ill, knowing his poverty, he took with him twenty drachmae when he visited him, and sitting down beside him he said, \" There is nothing here but those elements of Empedocles, ‘fire and water and earth and balmy expanse of air,' but you don't lie very comfortably,\" and with that he moved his pillow, and privately put the money under it.", "2274": "And when his old housekeeper found it, and wonderingly told Apelles of it, he laughed and said, \" This is some trick of Arcesilaus.\"", "2275": "And the saying is also true in philosophy that children are like their parents.”", "2276": "2", "2277": "For when Cephisocrates had to stand his trial on a bill of indictment, Lacydes (who was an intimate friend of Arce­ silaus) stood by him with several other friends, and when the prosecutor asked for his ring, which was the principal evidence against him, Cephisocrates quietly dropped it on the ground, and Lacydes noticing this put his foot on it and so hid it.", "2278": "And after sentence was pro­ nounced in his favour, Cephisocrates going up to thank the jury, one of them who had seen the artifice told him to thank Lacydes, and related to him all the matter, though Lacydes had not said a word about it to anybody.", "2279": "So also I think the gods do often perform benefits secretly, taking a natural delight in bestowing their favours and bounties.", "2280": "1", "2281": "But the good service of the flatterer has no justice, or genuineness, or simplicity, or liberality about it;", "2282": "but is accompanied with sweat, and running about, and noise, and knitting of the brow, creating an impression and appearance of toilsome and bustling service, like a painting over-curiously wrought in bold colours, and with bent folds wrinkles and angles, to make the closer re­ semblance to life.", "2283": "Moreover he tires one by relating what journeys and anxieties he has had over the matter, how many enemies he has made over it, the thousand bothers and annoyances he has gone through, so that you say, \" The affair was not worth all this trouble.\"", "2284": "For being reminded of any favour done to one is always unpleasant and disagreeable and insufferable:", "2285": "2 but the flatterer not only reminds us of his services afterwards, but even during the very moment of doing them upbraids us with them and is importunate.", "2286": "But the friend, if he is obliged to mention the matter, relates it modestly, and says not a word about himself.", "2287": "And so, when the Lacedæmonians sent corn to the people of Smyrna that needed it, and the people of Smyrna wondered at their kindness, the Lacedæ­ m'onians said, \" It was no great matter, we only voted that we and our beasts of burden should go without our dinner one day, and sent what was so saved to you.”", "2288": "1", "2289": "Not only is it handsome to do a favour in that way, but it is more pleasant to the receivers of it, because they think those who have done them the service have done it at no great loss to themselves.", "2290": "§", "2291": "XXIII.", "2292": "But it is not so much by the importunity of the flatterer in regard to services, nor by his facility in making promises, that one can recognize his nature, as by the honourable or dishonourable kind of service, and by the regard to please or to be of real use.", "2293": "For the friend is not as Gorgias defined him, one who will ask his friend to help him in what is right, while he will himself do many services for his friend that are not right.", "2294": "“For friend should share in good not in bad action.”", "2295": "2", "2296": "He will therefore rather try and turn him away from what is not becoming, and if he cannot persuade him, good is that answer of Phocion to Antipater, \"You cannot have me both as friend and flatterer,”3 that is, as friend and no friend.", "2297": "For one must indeed assist one's friend but not do anything wrong for him, one must advise with him but not plot with him, one must bear witness for him but not join him in fraud, one must certainly share adversity with him but not crime.", "2298": "For since we should not wish even to know of our friends' dishonourable acts, much less should we desire to share their dishonour by acting with them.", "2299": "As then the Lacedæmonians, when conquered in battle by Antipater, on settling the terms of peace, begged that he would lay upon them what burdens he pleased, provided he enjoined nothing dishonourable, so the friend, if any necessity arise involving expense or danger or trouble, is the first to desire to be applied to and share in it with alacrity and without crying off, but if there be anything disgraceful in connection with it he begs to have nothing to do with it.", "2300": "The flatterer on the contrary cries off from toilsome and dangerous employments, and if you put him to the test by ringing him,1 he returns a hollow and spurious sound, and finds some excuse ;", "2301": "whereas use him in disgraceful and low and disreputable service, and trample upon him, he will think no treatment too bad or igno­ minious.", "2302": "Have you observed the ape ?", "2303": "He cannot guard the house like the do,,,, nor bear burdens like the horse, nor plough like the ox, so he has to bear insult and ribaldry, and put up with being made sport of, exhibiting himself as an instrument to produce laughter.", "2304": "So too the flatterer, who can neither advocate your cause, nor give you useful counsel, nor share in your contention with anybody, but shirks all labour and toil, never makes any excuses in underhand transactions, is sure to lend a helping hand in any love affair, is energetic in setting free some harlot, and not careless in clearing off the account of a drinking score, nor remiss in making preparations for banquets, and obse­ quious to concubines, but if ordered to be uncivil to your relations, or to help in turning your wife out of doors, he is relentless and not to be put out of countenance.", "2305": "So that he is not hard to detect here too.", "2306": "For if ordered to do anything you please disreputable or dishonourable, he is ready to take any pains to oblige you.", "2307": "§", "2308": "XXIV.", "2309": "One might detect again how greatly the flatterer differs from the friend by his behaviour to other friends.", "2310": "For the friend is best pleased with loving and being beloved by many, and also always tries to contrive for his friend that he too may be much loved and honoured, for he believes in the proverb \" the goods of friends are common property,\" 2 and thinks it ought to apply to nothing more than to friends;", "2311": "but the false and spurious and counterfeit friend, knowing how much he debases friendship, like debased and spurious coin, is not only by nature envious, but shows his envy even of those who are like himself, striving to outdo them in scurrility and gossip, while he quakes and trembles at any of his betters, not by Zeus \" merely walking on foot by their Lydian chariot,\" but, to use the language of Simonides, \" not even having pure lead by comparison with their refined gold.”", "2312": "1", "2313": "Whenever then, being light and counterfeit and false, he is put to the test at close quarters with a true and solid and cast-iron friend­ ship, he cannot stand the test but is detected at once, and imitates the conduct of the painter that painted some wretched cocks, for he ordered his lad to scare away all live cocks as far from his picture as possible.", "2314": "So he too scares away real friends and will not let them come near if he can help it, but if he cannot prevent that, he openly fawns upon them, and courts them, and admires them as his betters, but privately runs them down and spreads calumnies about them.", "2315": "And when secret detraction has produced a sore feeling,2 if he has not effected his end completely, he re­ members and observes the teaching of Medius, who was the chief of Alexander's flatterers, and a leading sophist in conspiracy against the best men.", "2316": "He bade people conn­ dently sow their calumny broadcast and bite with it, teaching them that even if the person injured should heal his sore, the scar of the calumny would remain.", "2317": "Con­ sumed by these scars, or rather gangrenes and cancers, Alexander put to death Callisthenes, and Parmenio, and Philotas;", "2318": "while he himself submitted to be completely out­ witted by such as Agnon, and Bagoas, and Agesias, and Demetrius, who worshipped him and tricked him up and feigned him to be a barbaric god.", "2319": "So great is the power of flattery, and nowhere greater, as it seems, than among the greatest people.", "2320": "For their thinking and wishing the best about themselves makes them credit the flatterer, and gives him courage.", "2321": "3", "2322": "For lofty heights are difficult of approach and hard to reach for those who endeavour to scale them, but the highmindedness and conceit of a person thrown off his balance by good fortune or good natural parts is easily reached by mean and petty people.", "2323": "§ xxv.", "2324": "And so we advised at the beginning of this dis­ course, and now advise again, to cut off self-love and too high an opinion of ourselves;", "2325": "for that flatters us first, and makes us more impressionable and prepared for external flatterers, But if we hearken to the god, and recognize the immense importance to everyone of that saying, \" Know thyself,”1 and at the same time carefully observe our nature and education and training, with its thousand shortcomings in respect to good, and the large proportion of vice and vanity mixed up with our words and deeds and feelings, we shall not make our­ selves so easy a mark for flatterers.", "2326": "Alexander said that he disbelieved those who called him a god chiefly in regard to sleep and the sexual delight, for in both those things he was more ignoble and emotional than in other respects.", "2327": "2", "2328": "So we, if we observe the blots, blemishes, shortcomings, and imperfections of our private selves, shall perceive clearly that we do not need a friend who shall bestow upon us praise and panegyric, but one that will reprove us, and speak plainly to us, aye, by Zeus, and censure us if we have done amiss.", "2329": "For it is only a few out of many that venture to speak plainly to their friends rather than gratify them, and even among those few you will not easily find any who know how to do so properly, for they think they are outspoken when they abuse and scold.", "2330": "And yet, just as in the case of any other medicine, to employ freedom of speech unseasonably is only to give needless pain and trouble, and in a manner to do so as to produce vexa­ tion the very thing the flatterer does so as to produce pleasure.", "2331": "For it does people harm not only to praise them unseasonably but also to blame them unseasonably, and es­ pecially exposes them to the successful attack of flatterers, for, like water, they abandon the rugged hills for the soft grassy valleys.", "2332": "And so outspokenness ought to be tempered with kindness, and reason ought to be called in to correct its excessive tartness, (as we tone down the too powerful glare of a lamp), that people may not, by being troubled and grieved at continual blame and rebuke, fly for refuge to the shade of the flatterer, and turn aside to him to free themselves from annoyance.", "2333": "For we ought, Philopappus, to banish all vice by virtue, not by the opposite vice, as some hold;", "2334": "by exchanging modesty for impudence, and countrified ways for town ribaldry, and by removing their character as far as possible from cowardice and effemi­ nacy, even if that should make people get very near to auda­ city and foolhardiness.", "2335": "And some even make superstition a plea for atheism, and stupidity a plea for knavery, per­ verting their nature, like a stick bent double, from inability to set it straight.", "2336": "But the basest disowning of flattery is to be disagreeable without any purpose in view, and it shows an altogether inelegant and clumsy unfitness for social intercourse to shun by unpleasing moroseness the suspicion of being mean and servile in friendship ;", "2337": "like the freedman in the comedy who thought railing only enjoying freedom of speech.", "2338": "Seeing then that it is equally disgrace­ ful to become a flatterer through trying only to please, as in avoiding flattery to destroy all friendship and intimacy by excessive freedom of speech, we must avoid both these extremes, and, as in any other case, make our freedom of speech agreeable by its moderation.", "2339": "So the subject itself seems next to demand that I should conclude it by dis­ cussing that point.", "2340": "§ xxvi.", "2341": "As then we see that much trouble arises from excessive freedom of speech, let us first of all detach from it any element of self-love, being carefully on our guard that we may not appear to upbraid on account of any private hurt or injury.", "2342": "For people do not regard a speech on the speaker's own behalf as arising from goodwill, but from anger, and reproach rather than admonition.", "2343": "For freedom in speech is friendly and has weight, but reproach is selfish and little.", "2344": "And so people respect and admire those that speak their mind freely, but accuse back and despise those that reproach them :", "2345": "as Agamemnon would not stand the moderate freedom of speech of Achilles, but submitted to and endured the bitter attack and speech of Odysseus, \" Pernicious chief, would that thou didst command Some sorry host, and not such men as these!", "2346": "” 1 for he was restrained by the carefulness and sobriety of his speech, and also Odysseus had no private motive of anger but only spoke out on behalf of Greece,2 whereas Achilles seemed rather vexed on his own account.", "2347": "And Achilles himself, though not sweet-tempered or mild of mood, but \" a terrible man, and one that would perchance blame an innocent person,” 3 yet silently listened to Patroclus bringing against him many such charges as the following, \" Pitiless one, thy sire never was Knight Peleus, nor thy mother gentle Thetis, But the blue sea and steep and rocky crags", "2348": "Thy parents were, so flinty is thy heart.”", "2349": "4 For as Hyperides the orator bade the Athenians consider not only whether he spoke bitterly, but whether he spoke so from interested motives,5 so the rebuke of a friend void of all private feeling is solemn and grave and what one dare not lightly face.", "2350": "And if anyone shows plainly in his free­ dom of speech, that he altogether passes over and dismisses any offences his friend has done to himself, and only blames him for other shortcomings, and does not spare him but gives him pain for the interests of others, the tone of his outspokenness is invincible, and the sweetness of his manner even intensifies the bitterness and austerity of his rebuke.", "2351": "And so it has well been said, that in anger and differences with our friends we ought more especially to act with a view to their interest or honour.", "2352": "And no less friendly is it, when it appears that we have been passed over and neglected, to boldly put in a word for others that are neglected too, and to remind people of them, as Plato, when he was out of favour with Dionysius, begged for an audience, and Dionysius granted it, thinking that Plato had some personal grievance and was going to enter into it, but Plato opened the conversation as follows, \" If, Dio­ nysins, you knew that some enemy had sailed to Sicily with a view to do you some harm, but found no opportunity, would you allow him to sail back again, and go off scot- free ? \" \"", "2353": "Certainly not, Plato,\" replied Dionysius, \" for we must not only hate and punish the deeds of our enemies, but also their intentions.\"", "2354": "\" If then,\" said Plato, \"anyone has come here for your benefit, and wishes to do you good, and you do not find him an opportunity, is it right to let him go away with neglect and without thanks ? \"", "2355": "And on Dionysius asking, who he meant, he replied, \" I mean AEschines, a man of as good a character as any of Socrates' pupils whatever, and able to improve by his conversation any with whom he might associate:", "2356": "and he is neglected, though he has made a long voyage here to discuss philosophy with you.\"", "2357": "This speech so affected Dionysius, that he at once threw his arms round Plato and embraced him, admiring his benevolence and loftiness of mind, and treated Æschines well and hand­ somely.", "2358": "§", "2359": "XXVII.", "2360": "In the next place, let us clear away as it were and remove all insolence, and jeering, and mocking, and ribaldry, which are the evil seasonings of freedom of speech.", "2361": "For as, when the surgeon performs an operation, a certain neatness and delicacy of touch ought to accompany his use of the knife, but all pantomimic and venturesome and fashionable suppleness and over-finicalness ought to be far away from his hand, so freedom of speech admits of dex­ terity and politeness, provided that a pleasant way of put­ ting it does not destroy the power of the rebuke, for impu­ dence and coarseness and insolence, if added to freedom of speech, entirely mar and ruin the effect.", "2362": "And so the harper plausibly and elegantly silenced Philip, who ven­ tured to dispute with him about proper playing on the harp, by answering him, “ God forbid that you should be so unfortunate, 0 king, as to understand harping better than me.\"", "2363": "But that was not a right answer of Epicharmus, when

these matters.\"", "2956": "And yet we often put questions to people, not so much because we want an answer, as to elicit from them conversation and friendly feeling, and from a wish to fit them for company, as Socrates drew out Theætetus and Charmides.", "2957": "For it is all one to run up and kiss one who wishes to be kissed by another, or to divert to oneself the attention that he was bestowing on another, as to intercept another person'is answers, and to transfer people's ears, and force their attention, and fix them on oneself;", "2958": "when, even if he that was asked declines to give an answer, it will be well to hold oneself in reserve, and only to meet the question modestly when one's turn comes, so framing one's answer as to seem to oblige the person who asked the question, and as if one had been appealed to for an answer by the other.", "2959": "For if people are asked questions and cannot give a satisfactory answer they are with justice excused;", "2960": "but he who without being asked undertakes to answer a question, and antici­ pates another, is disagreeable even if he succeeds, while, if his answer is unsatisfactory, he is ridiculed by all the com­ pany, and his failure is a source of the liveliest satisfaction to them.§ xx.", "2961": "The next thing to practise oneself to in answering the questions put to one,-a point to which the talkative person ought to pay the greatest attention,-is not through inadvertence to give serious answers to people who only challenge you to talk in fun and sport.", "2962": "For some people concoct questions not for real information, but simply for amusement and to pass the time away, and propound them to talkative people, just to have them on.", "2963": "Against this we must be on our guard, and not rush into conversation too hastily, or as if we were obliged for the chance, but we must consider the character of the inquirer and his purpose.", "2964": "When it seems that be really desires information, we should accustom ourselves to pause, and interpose some interval between the question and answer;", "2965": "during which time the questioner can add anything if he chooses, and the other can reflect on his answer, and not be in too great a hurry about it, nor bury it in obscurity, nor, as is frequently the case in too great haste, answer some other question than that which was asked.", "2966": "The Pythian Priestess indeed was accus­ tomed to utter some of her oracles at the very moment before the question was put:", "2967": "for the god whom she serves \"understands the dumb, and hears the mute.”", "2968": "1", "2969": "But he that wishes to give an appropriate answer must carefully consider both the question and the mind of the questioner, lest it be as the proverb expresses it, \" I asked for shovels, they denied me pails.”", "2970": "1 Besides we ought to check this greediness and hunger for words, that it may not seem as if we had a flood on our tongue which was dammed up, but which we were only too glad to discharge2 on a question being put.", "2971": "Socrates indeed so repressed his thirst, that he would not allow himself to drink after exercise in the gymnasium, till he had first drawn from the well one bucket of water and poured it on to the ground, that he might accustom his irrational part to wait upon reason.", "2972": "§ XXI.", "2973": "There are moreover three kinds of answers to questions, the necessary, the polite, and the superfluous.", "2974": "For instance, if anyone asked, \"Is Socrates at home?\" one, as if backward and disinclined to answer, might say, “Not at home;", "2975": "\" or, if he wished to speak with Laconic brevity, might cut off \" at home,\" and simply say \" No ;", "2976": "” as, when Philip wrote to the Lacedæmonians to ask if they would receive him in their city, they sent him back merely a large \"No.\"", "2977": "But another would answer more politely, \" He is not at home, but with the bankers,\" and if he wished to add a little more, \" be expects to see some strangers there.\"", "2978": "But the superfluous prater, if he has read Antimachus of Colophony says, “He is not at home, but with the bankers, waiting for some Ionian strangers, about whom he has had a letter from Alcibiades who is in the neighbourhood of Miletus, staying with Tissapbernes the satrap of the great king, who used long ago to favour the Lacedæmonian party, but now attaches himself to the Athenians for Alcibiades' sake, for Alcibiades desires to return to his country, and so has succeeded in changing the views of Tissaphernes.\"", "2979": "And then he will go over the whole of the Eighth Book of Thucydides, and deluge the man, till before he is aware Miletus is captured, and Alcibiades is in exile the second time.", "2980": "In such a case most of all ought we to curtail talkativeness, by following the track of a question closely, and tracing ont our answer according to the need of the questioner with the same accuracy as we describe a circle.", "2981": "When Carneades was disputing in the gymnasium before the days of his great fame, the superintendent of the gymnasium sent to him a message to bid him modulate his voice (for it was of the loudest), and when he asked him to fix a standard, the superintendent replied not amiss, \" The standard of the person talking with you.\"", "2982": "So the meaning of the ques­ tioner ought to be the standard for the answer.", "2983": "§ XXII.", "2984": "Moreover as Socrates urged his disciples to abstain from such food as tempted them to eat when they were not hungry, and from such drinks as tempted them to drink when they were not thirsty, so the talkative person ought to be afraid most of such subjects of conversation as he most delights in and repeats ad nauseam, and to try and resist their influence.", "2985": "For example, soldiers are fond of descrip­ tions about war, and thus Homer introduces Nestor fre­ quently narrating his prowess and glorious deeds.", "2986": "And generally speaking those who have been successful in the law courts, or beyond their hopes been favourites of kings and princes, are possessed, as it were by some disease, with the itch for frequently recalling and narrating, how they got on and were advanced, what struggles they underwent, how they argued on some famous occasion, how they won the day either as plaintiffs or defendants, what panegyrics were showered upon them.", "2987": "For joy is much more in­ clined to prate than the well-known sleeplessness repre­ sented in comedies, frequently rousing itself, and finding something fresh to relate.", "2988": "And so at any excuse they slip into such narratives.", "2989": "For not only, “Where anyone does itch, there goes his hand,\"1 but also delight has a voice of its own, and leads about the tongue in its train, ever wishing to fortify it with memory.", "2990": "Thus lovers spend most of their time in conversations that revive the memory of their loves ;", "2991": "and if they cannot talk to human beings about them, they talk about them to inanimate objects, as, \" 0 dearest bed,\" and, \" 0 happy lamp, Bacchis deems you a god, And if she thinks so, then you are indeed The greatest of the gods.\"", "2992": "The talkative person therefore is merely as regards words a white line,1 but he that is especially inclined to certain sub­ jects should be especially on his guard against talking about them, and should avoid such topics, since from the pleasure they give him they may entice him to be very prolix and tedious.", "2993": "The same is the case with people in regard to such subjects as they think they are more experienced in and acquainted with than others.", "2994": "For such a one, being self-appreciative and fond of fame, \" spends most of the day in that particular branch of study in which he chances to be proficient.\"", "2995": "2", "2996": "Thus he that is fond of reading will give his time to research;",

in which he was superior to them, but to those in which he was inferior, partly that he might not give them pain through his supe­ riority, partly for his own benefit by learning from them.", "3001": "But the talkative person acts just contrary, for if any sub­ ject is introduced from which he might learn something he did not know, this he rejects and refuses, not being able to earn a good deal by a short silence,3 but be rambles round the subject and babbles out stale and commonplace rhapsodies.", "3002": "As one amongst us, who by chance had read two or three of the books of Ephorus,4 bored everybody, and dispersed every social party, by always narrating the particulars of the battle of Leuctra and its consequences, so that he got nicknamed Epaminondas.§", "3003": "XXIII.", "3004": "Nevertheless this is one of the least of the evils of talkativeness, and we ought even to try and divert it into such channels as these, for prating is less of a nuisance when it is on some literary subject.", "3005": "We ought also to try and get some persons to write on some topic, and so discuss it by themselves.", "3006": "For Antipater the Stoic philosopher,1 not being able or willing it seems to dispute with Carneades, who inveighed vehemently against the Stoic philosophy, writing and filling many books of controversy against him, got the nickname of Noisy-with-the-pen;", "3007":

dogs, bestowing their rage on sticks and stones, are less savage to men.", "3009": "It will also be very advantageous for such to mix with people better and older than themselves, for they will accustom themselves to be silent by standing in awe of their reputation.", "3010": "And withal it will be well, when we are going to say something, and the words are on our lips, to reflect and consider, \" What is this word that is so eager for utterance ?", "3011": "To what is this tongue marching ?", "3012": "What good will come of speaking now, or what harm of silence ? \"", "3013": "For we ought not to drop words as we should a burden that pressed upon us, for the word remains still after it has been spoken just the same ;", "3014": "but men speak either on their own behalf if they want something, or to benefit those that hear them, or, to gratify one another, they season everyday life with speech, as one seasons food with salt.", "3015": "But if words are neither useful to the speaker, nor necessary for the hearer, nor contain any pleasure or charm, why are they spoken ?", "3016": "For words may be idle and useless as well as deeds.", "3017": "And besides all this we must ever remember as most important the dictum of Simonides, that he had often repented he had spoken, but never that he had been silent:", "3018": "while as to the power and strength of practice consider

curse of the tragedian, “ Perish, compiler of thy neighbours' ills ? \"", "3150": "And independently of such a curse, the piling up of other people's misdoings is indecent and useless, and like the

not of lines or poems but of people's lives, render their memory a most inelegant and unlovely register of dark deeds.", "3152": "Just as there are in Rome some people who care nothing for pictures

them in leashes, keeping their sense of smell pure and fresh for the ob­ ject of their chase, that they may the keener dart on their tracks, \" following up the traces of the unfortunate beasts by their scent,\" so we must check and repress the sallies and excursions of the curious man to every object of interest, whether of sight or hearing, and confine him to what is useful.", "3162": "For as

bashful man that he has a nature courteous and civil and affable, and not hard as flint or self-willed.", "3238": "And so the Stoics from the outset verbally distinguished shame and shyness from mo­

hired at great cost murders 2 Menander, and most of the party clap and applaud, I find it by no means hard, or bad manners, to listen silently, and not to be so illiberal as to praise con­ trary to one's convictions.", "3283": "For if in such matters you are not master of yourself, what will you do if your friend reads a poor poem, or parades a speech stupidly and ridicu­ lously written ?3",

use legal forms to get it back.\"", "3332": "For many, at first too bashful to see to security, have afterwards had to go to law, and lost their friend.'§ xi.", "3333": "Plato again, giving Helicon of Cyzicus a letter for Dionysius, praised the bearer as a man of goodness and moderation, but added at the end of the letter, \" I write you this about a man, an animal by nature apt to change.\"", "3334": "But Xenocrates, though a man of austere character, was prevailed upon through his bashfulness to recommend to Polysperchon by letter, one who was no good man as the event showed;", "3335": "for when the Macedonian welcomed him, and inquired if he wanted any money, he asked for a talent, and Polyspercbon gave it him, but wrote to Xeno­ crates advising him for the future to be more careful in the choice of people he recommended.", "3336": "But Xenocrates knew not the fellow's true character;", "3337": "we on the other hand very often when we know that such and such men are bad, yet give them testimonials and money, doing ourselves injury, and not getting any pleasure for it, as people do get in the company of whores and flatterers, but being vexed and disgusted at the importunity that has upset and forced our reason.", "3338": "For the line \" I know that what I'm going to do is bad,”1 is especially applicable to people that importune us, when one is going to perjure oneself, or deliver an unjust verdict, or vote for a measure that is inexpedient, or borrow money for someone who will never pay it back.", "3339": "§ XII.", "3340": "And so repentance follows more closely upon bash­ fulness than upon any emotion, and that Dot afterwards but in the very act.", "3341": "For we are vexed with ourselves when we give, and ashamed when we perjure ourselves, and get ill-fame from our advocacies, and are put to the blush when we cannot fulfil our promises.", "3342": "For frequently, from inability to say No, we promise impossibilities to perse­ vering applicants, as introductions at court, and audiences with princes, from reluctance or want of nerve to say, \" The king does not know us, others have his regard far more.\"", "3343": "But Lysander, when he was out of favour with Agesilaus, though he was thought to have very great influence with him owing to his great reputation, was not ashamed to dismiss suitors, and bid them go and pay their court to others who had more influence with the king.", "3344": "For not to be able to do everything carries no disgrace with it, but to undertake and try and force your way to what you are unable to do, or unqualified by nature for, is in addition to the disgrace incurred a task full of trouble.", "3345": "§ XIII.", "3346": "To take another element into consideration, all seemly and modest requests we ought readily to comply with, not bashfully but heartily, whereas in injurious or unreasonable requests we ought ever to remember the con­ duct of Zeno, who, meeting a young man he knew walking very quietly near a wall, and learning from him that he was trying to get out of the way of a friend who wanted him to perjure himself on his behalf, said to him, \" 0 stupid fellow, what do you tell me ?", "3347": "Is he not afraid or ashamed to press you to what is not right ?", "3348": "And dare not you stand up boldly against him for what is right?\"", "3349": "For he that said \" villainy is no bad weapon against villainy \"1 taught people the bad practice of standing on one's defence against vice by imitating it;", "3350": "but to get rid of those who shame­ lessly and unblushingly importune us by their own effron­ tery, and not to gratify the immodest in their disgrace­ ful desires through false modesty, is the right and proper conduct of sensible people.", "3351": "§ xiv.", "3352": "Moreover it is no great task to resist disreputable and low and worthless fellows who importune you, but some send such off with a laugh or a jest, as Theocritus did, who, when two fellows in the public baths, one a stranger, the other a well-known thief, wanted to borrow his scraper,2 put them both off with a playful answer, \"You, sir, I don't know, and you I know too well.\"", "3353": "And Lysimache,3 the priestess of Athene Polias at Athens, when some muleteers that bore the sacred vessels asked her to give them a drink, answered, \" I hesitate to do so from fear that you would make a practice of it.\"", "3354": "And when a cer­ tain young man, the son of a distinguished officer, but himself effeminate and far from bold, asked Antigonus for promotion, he replied, \" With me, young man, honours are given for personal prowess, not for the prowess of an­ cestors.\"§ XV.", "3355": "But if the person that importunes us be famous or a man of power, for such persons are very hard to move by entreaty or to get rid of when they come to sue for your vote and interest, it will not perhaps be easy or even ne­ cessary to behave as Cato, when quite a young man, did to Catulus.", "3356": "Catulus was in the highest repute at Rome, and at that time held the office of censor, and went to Cato, who then held the office of quæstor, and tried to beg off some­ one whom he had fined, and was urgent and even violent in his petitions, till Cato at last lost all patience, and said, “ To have you, the censor, removed by my officers against your will, Catulus, would not be a seemly thing for you.\"", "3357": "So Callus felt ashamed, and went off in a rage.", "3358": "But see whether the answers of Agesilaus and Themistocles are not more modest and in better form.", "3359": "Agesilaus, when he was asked by his father to pronounce sentence contrary to the law, said, \" Father, I was taught by you even from my earliest years to obey the laws, so now I shall obey you and do nothing contrary to law.\"", "3360": "And Themistocles, when Simonides asked him to do something unjust, replied, it Neither would you be a good poet if your lines violated the laws of metre, nor should I be a good magistrate if I gave decisions contrary to law.\"§ XVI.", "3361": "And yet it is not on account of want of metrical harmony in respect to the lyre, to borrow the words of Plato, that cities quarrel with cities and friends with friends, and do and suffer the worst woes, but on account of deviations1 from law and justice.", "3362": "And yet some, who themselves pay great attention to melody and letters and measures, do not think it wrong for others to neglect what is right in magistracies and judicial sentences and business generally.", "3363": "One must therefore deal with them in the fol­ lowing manner.", "3364": "Does an orator ask a favour of you when you are acting as juryman, or a demagogue when you are sitting in council ?", "3365": "Say you will grant his request if he first utter a solecism, or introduce a barbarism into his speech;", "3366": "he will refuse because of the shame that would attach itself to him;", "3367": "at any rate we see some that will not in a speech let two vowels come together.", "3368": "If again some illustrious and distinguished person importune you to something bad, bid him come into the market-place dancing or making wry faces, and if he refuse you will have an opportunity to speak, and ask him which is more disgraceful, to utter a solecism and make wry faces, or to violate the Jaw and one's oath, and contrary to justice to do more for a bad than for a good man.", "3369": "Nicostratus the Argive, when Archidamus offered him a large sum of money and any Lacedæmonian bride he chose if he would deliver up Cromnum, said Archidamus could not be a descendant of Hercules, for he travelled about and killed evil-doers, whereas Archidamus tried to make evil-doers of the good.", "3370": "In like manner, if a man of good repute tries to force and importune us to something bad, let us tell him that he is acting in an ignoble way, and not as his birth and virtue would warrant.", "3371": "§ XVII.", "3372": "But in the case of people of no repute you must see whether you can persuade the miser by your impor­ tunity to lend you money without a bond, or the proud man to yield you the better place, or the ambitious man to surrender some office to you when he might take it him­ self.", "3373": "For truly it would seem monstrous that, while such remain firm and inflexible and unmoveable in their vicious propensities, we who wish to be, and profess to be, men of honour and justice should be so little masters of ourselves as to abandon and betray virtue.", "3374": "For indeed, if those who importune us do it for glory and power, it is absurd that we should adorn and aggrandize others only to get infamy and a bad name ourselves;", "3375": "like unfair umpires in the public games, or like people voting only to ingratiate themselves, and so bestowing improperly offices and prizes1 and glory on others, while they rob themselves of respect and fair fame.", "3376": "And if we see that the person who impor­ tunes us only does so for money, does it not occur to one that it is monstrous to be prodigal of one's own fame and reputation merely to make somebody else's purse heavier ?", "3377": "Why the idea must occur to most people, they sin with their eyes open ;", "3378": "like people who are urged hard to toss off big bumpers, and grunt and groan and make wry faces, but at last do as they are told.", "3379": "§ XVIII.", "3380": "Such weakness of mind is like a temperament of body equally susceptible to heat and cold ;", "3381": "for if such people are praised by those that importune them they are overcome and yield at once, whereas they are mortally afraid of the blame and suspicions of those whose desires they do not comply with.", "3382": "But we ought to be stout and resolute in either case, neither yielding to bullying nor cajolery.", "3383": "Thucydides indeed tells us, since envy necessarily follows ability, that \" he is well advised who incurs envy in matters of the highest importance.\"", "3384": "2", "3385": "But we, thinking it difficult to escape envy, and seeing that it is altogether impossible not to incur blame or give offence to those we live with, shall be well advised if we prefer the hatred of the perverse to that of those who might justly find fault with us for having iniquitously served their turn.", "3386": "And indeed we ought to be on our guard against praise from those who importune us, which is sure to be altogether in­ sincere, and not to resemble swine, readily allowing anyone that presses to make use of us from our pleasure at itching and tickling, and submitting ourselves to their will.", "3387": "For those that give their ears to flatterers differ not a whit from such as let themselves be tripped up at wrestling, only their overthrow and fall is more disgraceful;", "3388": "some for­ bearing hostility and reproof in the case of bad men, that they may be called merciful and humane and compas­ sionate ;", "3389": "and others on the contrary persuaded to take up unnecessary and dangerous animosities and charges by those who praise them as the only men, the only people that never flatter, and go so far as to entitle them their mouthpieces and voices.", "3390": "Accordingly Bio1 compared such people to jars, that you could easily take by the ears and turn about at your will.", "3391": "Thus it is recorded that the sophist Alexinus in one of his lectures said a good many bad things about Stilpo the Megarian, but when one of those that were present said, \" Why, he was speaking in your praise only the other day,\" he replied, \" I don't doubt it;", "3392": "for he is the best and noblest of men.\"", "3393": "Menedemus on the contrary, having heard that Alexinus2 frequently praised him, replied, \" But I always censure him, for that Yuan is bad who either praises a bad man or is blamed by a good.\"", "3394": "So inflexible and proof was be against such flattery, and master of that advice which Hercules in Antisthenes' gave, when he ordered his sons to be grateful to no one that praised them;", "3395": "which meant nothing else than that they should not be dumbfoundered at it, nor flatter again those who praised them.", "3396": "Very apt, I take it, was the remark of Pindar to one who told him that he praised him everywhere and to all persons, \" I am greatly obliged to you, and will make your account true by my actions.\"§ xix.", "3397": "A useful precept in reference to all passions is especially valuable in the case of the bashful.", "3398": "When they have been overcome by this infirmity, and against their judgement have erred and been confounded, let them fix it in their memories, and, remembering the pain and grief it gave them, let them recall it to their mind and be on their guard for a very long time.", "3399": "For as travellers that have stumbled against a stone, or pilots that have been wrecked off a headland, if they remember these occurrences, not only dread and are on their guard continually on those spots, but also on all similar ones;", "3400": "so those that frequently remember the disgrace and injury that bashfulness brought them, and its sorrow and anguish, will in similar cases be on their guard against their weakness, and will not readily allow themselves to be subjugated by it again.§ I. Sylla.", "3401": "Those painters, Fundanus, seem to me to do well who, before giving the finishing touches to their paintings, lay them by for a time and then revise them ;", "3402": "because by taking their eyes off them for a time they gain by frequent inspection a new insight, and are more apt to detect minute differences, that continuous familiarity would have hidden.", "3403": "Now since a human being cannot so separate himself from himself for a time, and make a break in his continuity, and then approach himself again-and that is perhaps the chief reason why a man is a worse judge of himself than of others-the next best thing will be for a man to inspect his friends after an interval, and likewise offer himself to their scrutiny, not to see whether he has aged quickly, or whether his bodily condition is butter or worse, but to examine his moral character, and see whether time has added any good quality, or removed any bad one.", "3404": "On my return then to Rome after an absence of two years, and having been with you now five months, I am not at all surprised that there has been a great increase and growth in those good points which you formerly had owing to your admirable nature;", "3405": "but when I see how gentle and obedient to reason your former excessive impetuosity and hot temper has become, it cannot but occur to me to quote the line, “ Ye gods, how much more mild is he become! ”1 And this mildness has not wrought in you sloth or weakness, but like cultivation of the soil it has produced a smoothness and depth fit for action, instead of the former impetuosity and vehemence.", "3406": "And so it is clear that your propensity to anger has not been effaced by any declining vigour or through some chance, but has been cured by good precepts.", "3407": "And indeed, for I will tell you the truth, when our friend Eros2 reported this change in you to me, I suspected that owing to goodwill he bare witness not of the actual state of the case, but of what was becoming to all good and virtuous men, although, as you know, he can never be persuaded to depart from his real opinion to in­ gratiate himself with anyone.", "3408": "But now he is acquitted of false witness, and do you, as your journey gives you leisure, narrate to me the mode of cure you employed to make your temper so under control, so natural, gentle and obedient to reason.", "3409": "Fundanus.", "3410": "Most friendly Sylla, take care that you do not in your goodwill and affection to me rest under any misconception of my real condition.", "3411": "For it is possible that Eros, not being able always himself to keep his temper in its place in the obedience that Homer speaks of,- but some­ times carried away by his hatred of what is bad, may think me grown milder than I really am, as in changes of the scale in music the lowest notes become the highest.", "3412": "Sylla.", "3413": "Neither of these is the case, Fundanus, but oblige me by doing as I ask.", "3414": "§ ii.", "3415": "Fundanus.", "3416": "One of the excellent precepts then of Musonius that I remember, Sylla, is this, that those who wish to be well should diet themselves all their life long.", "3417": "For I do not think we must employ reason as a cure, as we do hellebore, by purging it out with the disease, but we must retain it in the soul, to restrain and govern the judge­ ment.", "3418": "For the power of reason is not like physic, but wholesome food, which co-operates with good health in producing a good habit of body in those by whom it is taken.", "3419": "But admonition and reproof, when passion is at its height and swelling, does little or no good, but resem­ bles very closely those strong-smelling substances, that are able to set on their legs again those that have fallen in epileptic fits, but cannot rid them of their disease.", "3420": "For although all other passions, even at the moment of their acme, do in some sort listen to reason and admit it into the soul, yet anger does not, for, as Melanthius says, “ Fell things it does when it the mind unsettles,\" for it absolutely turns reason out of doors, and bolts it out, and, like those persons who burn themselves and houses together, it makes all the interior full of confusion and smoke and noise, so that what would be advantageous can neither be seen nor heard.", "3421": "And so an empty ship in a storm at open sea would sooner admit on board a pilot from without, than a man in a tempest of rage and anger would listen to another's advice, unless his own reason was first prepared to hearken.", "3422": "But as those who expect a siege get together and store up supplies, when they despair of relief from without, so ought we by all means to scour the country far and wide to derive aids against anger from philosophy, and store them up in the soul:", "3423": "for, when the time of need comes, we shall find it no easy task to import them.", "3424": "For either the soul doesn't hear what is said with­ out because of the uproar, if it have not within its own reason (like a boatswain as it were) to receive at once and understand every exhortation;", "3425": "or if it does hear, it despises what is uttered mildly and gently, while it is exasperated by harsh censure.", "3426": "For anger being haughty and self- willed and hard to be worked upon by another, like a fortified tyranny, must have someone born and bred within it1 to overthrow it.", "3427": "§ III.", "3428": "Now long-continued anger, and frequent giving way to it, produces an evil disposition of soul, which people call irascibility, and which ends in passionateness, bitter­ ness, and peevishness, whenever the mind becomes sore and vexed at trifles and querulous at everyday occurrences, like iron thin and beaten out too fine.", "3429": "But when the judgement checks and suppresses at once the rising anger, it not only cures the soul for the moment, but restores its tone and balance for the future.", "3430": "It has happened to myself indeed twice or thrice, when I strongly fought against anger, that I was in the same plight as the Thebans, who after they had once defeated the Lacedæmonians, whom they had hitherto thought invincible, never lost a battle against them again.", "3431": "I then felt confident that reason can win the victory.", "3432": "I saw also that anger is not only appeased by the sprinkling of cold water, as Aristotle attested, but is also extinguished by the action of fear ;", "3433": "aye, and, as Homer tells us, anger has been cured and has melted away in the case of many by some sudden joy.", "3434": "So that I came to the con­ clusion that this passion is not incurable for those who wish to be cured.", "3435": "For it does not arise from great and important causes, but banter and joking, a laugh or a nod, and similar trifles make many angry, as Helen by addressing her niece, \" Electra, maiden now for no short time,\" 2 provoked her to reply, “ Your wisdom blossoms late, since formerly", "3436": "You left your house in shame;", "3437": "\" 3 and Callisthenes incensed Alexander, by saying, when a huge cup was brought to him, “ I will not drink to Alex­ ander till I shall require the help of Æsculapius.”", "3438": "§ iv.", "3439": "As then it is easy to put out a flame kindled in the hair of hares and in wicks and rubbish, but if it once gets hold of things solid and thick, it quickly destroys and consumes them, “ raging amidst the lofty work of the carpenters,\" as Æschylus1 says ;", "3440": "so he that observes anger in its rise, and sees it gradually smoking and bursting forth into fire from some chatter or rubbishy scurrility, need have no great trouble with it, but can frequently smother it merely by silence and contempt.", "3441": "For as a person puts out a fire by bringing no fuel to it, so with respect to anger, he that does not in the beginning fan it, and stir up its rage in himself, keeps it off and destroys it.", "3442": "And so, though Hieronymus has given -as many useful sayings and precepts, I am not pleased with his remark that there is no perception of anger in its birth, but only in its actual developement, so quick is it.", "3443": "For none of the passions when stirred up and set in motion has so palpable a birth and growth as anger.", "3444": "As indeed Homer skilfully shows us, where he represents Achilles as seized at once with grief, when word was brought him of Patroclus' death, in the line, \" Thus spake he, and griefs dark cloud covered him ;", "3445": "” 2 whereas he represents him as waxing angry with Agamem­ non slowly, and as inflamed by his many words, which if either of them3 had abstained from, their quarrel would not have attained such growth and magnitude.", "3446": "And so Socrates, as often as he perceived any anger rising in him against any of his friends, \"setting himself like some ocean promontory to break the violence of the waves,\" would lower his voice, and put on a smiling countenance, and give his eye a gentler expression, by inclining in the other direction and running counter to his passion, thus keeping himself from fall and defeat.", "3447": "§ v.", "3448": "For the first way, my friend, to overcome anger, like the putting down of some tyrant, is not to obey or listen to it when it bids you speak loud, and look fierce, and beat yourself, but to remain quiet, and not to make the passion more intense, as one would a disease, by tossing about and crying out.", "3449": "In love affairs indeed, such things as revellings, and serenadings, and crowning the loved one's door with garlands, may indeed bring some pleasant and elegant relief.", "3450": "\" I went, but asked not who or whose she was, I merely kissed her door-post.", "3451": "If that be A crime, I do plead guilty to the same.”", "3452": "1", "3453": "In the case of mourners also giving up to weeping and wailing takes away with the tears much of the grief.", "3454": "But anger on the contrary is much more fanned by what angry persons do and say.", "3455": "It is best therefore to be calm, or to flee and hide ourselves and go to a haven of quiet, when we feel the fit of temper coming upon us as an epileptic fit, that we fall not, or rather fall not on others, for it is our friends that we fall upon most and most frequently.", "3456": "For we do not love all, nor envy all, nor fear all men ;", "3457": "but nothing is untouched or unassailed by anger;", "3458": "for we are angry with friends and enemies, parents and children, aye, and with the gods, and beasts, and even things inanimate, as was Thamyris, \" Breaking his gold-bound horn, breaking the music", "3459": "Of well-compacted lyrea;", "3460": "”2 and

letters to Mount Athos, \" Divine Athos, whose top reaches heaven, put not in the way of my works stones large and difficult to deal with, or else I will hew thee down, and throw thee into the

"3465": "§ vi.", "3466": "To begin then, whether my process was wrong or right I know not, but I began my cure of anger by noticing its effects in others, as the Lacedæmonians study the nature of drunkenness in the Helots.", "3467": "And in the first place, as Hippocrates tells us that disease is most dangerous in which the face of the patient is most unlike himself, so observing that people beside themselves with anger change their face, colour, walk, and voice, I formed an impression as it were of that aspect of passion, and was very disgusted with myself if ever I should appear so frightful and like one out of his mind to my friends and wife and daughters, not only wild and unlike oneself in appearance, but also with a voice savage and harsh, as I had noticed in some 1 of my acquaintance, who could neither preserve for anger their ordinary behaviour, or demea­ nour, or grace of language, or persuasiveness and gentle­ ness in conversation.", "3468": "Caius Gracchus, indeed, the orator, whose character was harsh and style of oratory impassioned, had a pitch-pipe made for him, such as musicians use to heighten or lower their voices by degrees, and this, when he was making a speech, a slave stood behind him and held, and used to give him a mild and gentle note on it, whereby he lowered his key, and removed from his voice the harsh and passionate element, charming and laying the heat of the orator, “ As shepherds' wax-joined reed sounds musically With sleep provoking strain.\"", "3469": "2", "3470": "For myself if I had some elegant and sprightly companion, I should not be vexed at his showing me a looking-glass in my fits of anger, as they offer one to some after a bath to little useful end.", "3471": "For to behold oneself unnaturally distorted in countenance will condemn anger in no small degree.", "3472": "The poets playfully tell us that Athene when play­ ing on the pipe was rebuked thus by a Satyr, \" That look no way becomes you, take your armour, Lay down your pipes, and do compose your cheeks,\" and though she paid no attention to him, yet afterwards when she saw her face in a river, she felt vexed and threw her pipes away, although art had made melody a compen­ sation for her unsightliness.", "3473": "And Marsyas, it seems, by a sort of mouthpiece forcibly repressed the violence of his breath, and tricked up and hid the contortion of his face, \" Around his shaggy temples put bright gold, And o'er his open mouth thongs tied behind.\"", "3474": "Now anger, that puffs up and distends the face so as to look ugly, utters a voice still more harsh and unpleasant, “ Moving the mind's chords undisturbed before.\"", "3475": "They say that the sea is cleansed when agitated by the winds it throws up tangle and seaweed;", "3476": "but the intem­ perate and bitter and vain words, which the mind throws up when the soul is agitated, defile the speakers of them first of all and fill them with infamy, as always having those thoughts within their bosom and being defiled with them, but only giving vent to them in anger.", "3477": "And so for a word which is, as Plato styles it, \" a very small matter,\" they incur a most heavy punishment, for they get reputed to be enemies, and evil speakers, and malignant in dis­ position.§ VII.", "3478": "Seeing and observing all this, it occurs to me to take it as a matter of fact, and record it for my own general use, that if it is good to keep the tongue soft and smooth in a fever, it is better to keep it so in anger.", "3479": "For if the tongue of people in a fever be unnatural, it is a bad sign, but not the cause of their malady;", "3480": "but the tongue of angry people, being rough and foul, and breaking out into unseemly speeches, produces insults that work irremediable mischief, and argue deep-rooted malevolence within.", "3481": "For wine drunk neat does not exhibit the soul in so ungovern­ able and hateful a condition as temper does:", "3482": "for the outbreaks of the one smack of laughter and fun, while those of the other are compounded with gall:", "3483": "and at a drinking-bout he that is silent is burdensome to the company and tiresome, whereas in anger nothing is more highly thought of than silence, as Sappho advises, \" When anger's busy in the brain Thy idly-barking tongue restrain.,,§ VIlI.", "3484": "And not only does the consideration of all this naturally arise from observing ourselves in the moments of anger, but we cannot help seeing also the other properties of rage, how ignoble it is, how unmanly, how devoid of dignity and greatness of mind !", "3485": "And yet to most people its noise seems vigour, its threatening confidence, and its obstinacy force of character ;", "3486": "some even not wisely entitle its savageness magnanimity, and its implacability firmness, and its morosity hatred of what is bad.", "3487": "For their actions and motions and whole demeanour argue great littleness and meanness, not only when they are fierce with little boys, and peevish with women, and think it right to treat dogs and horses and mules with harshness, as Ctesiphon the pancratiast thought fit to kick back a mule that had kicked him, but even in the butcheries that tyrants commit their littleness of soul is apparent in their savageness, and their suffering in their action, so that they are like the bites of serpents, that, when they are burnt and smart with pain, violently thrust their venom on those that have hurt them.", "3488": "For as a swelling is produced in the flesh by a heavy blow, so in softest souls the inclination to hurt others gets its greater strength from greater weakness.", "3489": "Thus women are more prone to anger than men, and people in than people well, and old men than men in their prime, and the unfortunate than the prosperous ;", "3490": "the miser is most prone to anger with his steward, the glutton with his cook, the jealous man with his wife, the vain man when he is spoken ill of ;", "3491": "and worst of all are those \" men who are too eager in states for office, or to head a faction, a manifest Borrow,\" to borrow Pindar's words.", "3492": "So from the very great pain and suffering of the soul there arises mainly from weakness anger, which is not like the nerves of the soul, as some one defined it, but like its strainings and convul­ sions when it is excessively vehement in its thirst for revenge.", "3493": "§ ix.", "3494": "Such bad examples as these were not pleasant to look at but necessary, but I shall now proceed to describe people who have

man stand this ? ” and, \" Put your heel upon his neck, and dash his head against the ground,\" and other provoking expressions such as these, by which some not well have transferred anger from the woman's side of the house to the man's.", "3496": "For manliness in all other respects seems to resemble justice, and to differ from it only in respect to gentleness, with which it has more affinities.", "3497": "For it sometimes happens to worse men to govern better ones, but to erect a trophy in the soul against anger (which Heraclitus says it is difficult to contend against, for whatever it wishes is bought at the price of the soul), is a proof of power so great and victorious as to be able to apply the judgement as if it were nerves and sinews to the passions.", "3498": "So I always try to collect and peruse the remarks on this subject not only of the philosophers, who foolish1 people say had no gall in their composition, but still more of kings and tyrants.", "3499": "Such was the remark of Antigonus to his soldiers, when they were abusing him near his tent as if he were not listening, so he put his staff out, and said, \" What's to do ?", "3500": "can you not go rather farther off to run me down ?”", "3501": "And when Arcadio the Achæan, who was always railing against Philip, and ad­ vising people to flee “", "3502": "Unto a country where they knew not Philip,\" visited Macedonia afterwards on some chance or other, the king's friends thought he ought to be punished and the matter not looked over;", "3503": "but Philip treated him kindly, snd sent

wonderful praiser of the king, Philip said, “ You see I knew how to cure him better than all of you.\"", "3505": "And at the Olympian games when there was defamation of Philip, and some of his suite said to him, that the Greeks ought to smart for it, because they railed against him when they were treated well by him, he replied, \" What will they do then if they are treated badly by me ?", "3506": "\"", "3507": "Excellent also was the behaviour of Pisistratus to Thrasy­ bulus, and of Porsena to Mucius, and of Magas to Philemon.", "3508": "As to Magas, after he had been publicly jeered at by Philemon in one of his comedies at the theatre in the following words, “ Magas, the king hath written thee a letter, Unhappy Magas, since thou can'st not read,\" after having taken Philemon, who had been cast on shore by a storm at Parætonium, he commanded one of his soldiers only to touch his neck with the naked sword and then to go away quietly, and dismissed him, after sending him a ball and some dice as if he were a silly boy.", "3509": "And Ptolemy on one occasion, flouting a grammarian for his ignorance, asked him who was the father of Peleus, and he answered, \" I will tell you, if you tell me first who was the father of Lagus.\"", "3510": "This was a jeer at the obscure birth of the king, and all his courtiers were indignant at it as an unpardonable liberty;", "3511": "but Ptolemy said, “If it is not kingly to take a flout, neither is it kingly to give one.\"", "3512": "And Alexander was more savage than usual in his behaviour to Callisthenes and Clitus.", "3513": "So

As then a certain person passed the following re­ mark on Philip when he had razed Olynthus to the ground, “ He certainly could not build such another city,\" so we may say to anger, \" You can root up, and destroy, and throw down, but to raise up and save and spare and tolerate is the work of mildness and moderation, the work of a Camillus, a Metellus, an Aristides, a Socrates;", "3518": "but to sting and bite is to resemble the ant and horse-fly.", "3519": "For, indeed, when I consider revenge, I find its angry method to be for the most part ineffectual, since it spends itself in biting the lips and gnashing the teeth, and in vain attacks, and in railings coupled with foolish threats, and eventually resembles children running races, who from feebleness ridiculously tumble down bbfore they reach the goal they are hastening to.", "3520": "So that speech of the Rhodian to a lictor of the Roman prætor who was shouting and talking insolently was not inapt, \" It is no matter to me what

"And so the Lacedæmonians by their pipes turn away the anger of their warriors, and sacrifice to the Muses before commencing battle, that reason may abide with them, and when they have routed a foe do not follow up the victory,3 but relax their rage, which like small daggers they can easily take back.", "3524": "But anger kills myriads before it is glutted with revenge, as happened in the case of Cyrus and Pelopidas the Theban.", "3525": "But Agathocles bore mildly the revilings of those he was besieging, and when one of them cried out, \" Potter, how are you going to get money to pay your mercenaries ? ” be replied laughingly, \" Out of your town if I take it.\"", "3526": "And when some of those on the wall threw his ugliness into the teeth of Antigonus, he said to them, \" 1 thought I

before their masters.", "3528": "I have noticed also that hunters and orators are very unsuccessful when they give way to anger.", "3529": "4", "3530": "And Aristotle tells us that the friends of Satyrus stopped up his ears with wax when he was to plead a cause, that he might not make any confusion in the case through rage at the abuse of his enemies.", "3531": "And does it not frequently happen with ourselves that a slave who has offended escapes punishment, because they abscond in fear of our threats and harsh words?", "3532": "What nurses then say to children, \" Give up crying, and

his boy trying to cut or cleave something with a knife, takes the knife from him and does it himself:", "3534": "and similarly a person, taking revenge out of the hand of passion, does himself safely and usefully and without harm punish the person who deserves punishment, and not himself instead, as anger often does.§ XI.", "3535": "Now though all the passions need such discipline as by exercise shall tame and subdue their unreasoning and disobedient elements, yet there is none which we ought to keep under by such discipline so much as the exhibition of anger to our servants.", "3536": "For neither envy, nor fear, nor rivalry come into play between them and us;", "3537": "but our fre­ quent displays of anger to them, creating many offences and faults, make us to slip as if on slippery ground owing to our autocracy with our servants, which no one resists or prevents.", "3538": "For it is impossible to check irresponsible power so as never to break out under the influence of passion, unless one wields power with much meekness, and refuses to listen to the frequent complaints of one's wife and friends charging one with being too easy and lax with one's servants.", "3539": "And by nothing have I been more exasperated against them, as if they were being ruined for want of correction.", "3540": "At last, though late, I got to see that in the first place it is better to make them worse by forbearance, than by bitterness and anger to distort oneself for the correction of others.", "3541": "In the next place I observed that many for the very reason that they were not corrected were frequently ashamed to be bad, and made pardon rather than punish­ ment the commencement of their reformation, aye, and made better slaves to some merely at their nod silently and cheerfully than to others with all their beatings and brandings, and so I came to the conclusion that reason gets better obeyed than temper, for it is not as the poet said, \"", "3542": "Where there is fear, there too is self-respect,\" but it is just the other way about, for self-respect begets that kind of fear that corrects the behaviour.", "3543": "But perpetual and pitiless beating produces not so much repentance for wrong-doing as contrivances to continue in it without detection.", "3544": "In the third place, ever remembering and re­ fleeting within myself that, just as he that teaches us the use of the bow does not forbid us to shoot but only to miss the mark, so it will not prevent punishment altogether to teach people to do it in season, and with moderation, utility, and decorum, I strive to remove anger most espe­ cially by not forbidding those who are to be corrected to speak in their defence, but by listening to them.", "3545": "For the interval of time gives a pause to passion, and a delay that mitigates it, and so judgement finds out both the fit manner and adequate amount of punishment.", "3546": "Moreover he that is punished has nothing to allege against his cor­ rection, if he is punished not in anger but only after his guilt is brought home to him.", "3547": "And the greatest disgrace will not be incurred, which is when the servant seems to speak more justly than the master.", "3548": "As then Phocion, after the death of Alexander, to stop the Athenians from revolt­ ing and believing the news too soon, said to them, \" Men of Athens, if he is dead to-day, he will certainly also be dead to-morrow and the next day,\" so I think the man who is in a hurry to punish anyone in his rage ought to consider with himself, \" If this person has wronged you to-day, he will also have wronged you to-morrow and the next day;", "3549": "and there will be no harm done if he shall be punished somewhat late ;", "3550": "whereas if he shall be pun­ ished at once, he will always seem to you to have been innocent, as has often happened before now.\"", "3551": "For which of us is so savage as to chastise and scourge a slave because five or ten days before he over-roasted the meat, or upset the table, or was somewhat tardy on some errand ?", "3552": "And yet these are the very things for which we put ourselves out and are harsh and implacable, immediately after they have happened and are recent.", "3553": "For as bodies seem greater in a mist, so do little matters in a rage.", "3554": "We ought therefore to consider such arguments as these at once, and if, when there is no trace of passion left, the matter appear bad to calm and clear reason, then it ought to be taken in hand, and the punishment ought not to be neglected or abandoned, as we leave food when we have lost our appetites.", "3555": "For nothing causes people to punish so much when their anger is fierce, as that when it is appeased they do not punish at all, but forget the matter entirely, and resemble lazy rowers, who lie in harbour when the sea is calm, and then sail out to their peril when the wind gets up.", "3556": "So we, condemning reason for slackness and mildness in punishing, are in a hurry to punish, borne along by passion as by a dangerous gale.", "3557": "He that is hungry takes his food as nature dictates, but he that punishes should have no hunger or thirst for it, nor require anger as a sauce to stimulate him to it, but should punish when he is as far as possible from having any desire for it, and has to compel his reason to it.", "3558": "For we ought not, as Aristotle tells us slaves in his time were scourged in Etruria to the music of the flute, to go head­ long into punishing with a desire and zest for it, and to delight in punishing, and then afterwards to be sorry at it -for the first is savage, and the last womanish-but we should without either sorrow or pleasure chastise at the dictates of reason, giving anger no opportunity to interfere.", "3559": "§ XII.", "3560": "But this perhaps will not appear a cure of anger so much as a putting away and avoiding such faults as men commit in anger.", "3561": "And yet, though the swelling of the spleen is only a symptom of fever, the fever is assuaged by its abating, as Hieronymus tells us.", "3562": "Now when I contem­ plated the origin of anger itself, I observed that, though different persons fell into it for different reasons, yet in nearly all of them was the idea of their being despised and neglected to be found.", "3563": "So we ought to help those who try to get rid of anger, by removing as far as possible from them any action savouring of contempt or contumely, and by looking upon their anger as folly or necessity, or emotion, or mischance, as Sophocles says, \" In those that are unfortunate, 0 king, No mind stays firm, but all their balance lose.”", "3564": "1", "3565": "And so Agamemnon, ascribing to Ate his carrying off Briseis, yet says to Achilles, \" I wish to please you in return, and give Completest satisfaction.”", "3566": "a For suing is not the action of one who shews his contempt, and when he that has done an injury is humble he removes all idea of slighting one.", "3567": "But the angry person must not expect this, but rather take to himself the answer of Diogenes, who, when it was said to him, \" These people laugh at you,\" replied, \" But I am not one to be laughed .at,\" and not think himself despised, but rather despise the person who gave the offence, as acting from weakness, or error, or rashness, or heedlessness, or illiberality, or old age, or youth.", "3568": "Nor must we entertain such notions with regard to our servants and friends.", "3569": "For they do not despise us as void of ability or energy, but owing to our evenness and good-nature, some because we are mild, and others presuming on our affection for them.", "3570": "But as it is we not only fly into rages with wife and slaves and friends, as if we were slighted by them, but we also frequently, from forming the same idea of being slighted, fall foul of innkeepers and sailors and muleteers, and are vexed at dogs that bark and asses that are in our way:", "3571": "like the man who was going to beat an ass-driver, but when he cried out he was an Athenian, he said to the ass, \"You are not an Athenian anyway,\" and beat it with many stripes.§", "3572": "XIII.", "3573": "Moreover those continuous and frequent fits of anger that gather together in the soul by degrees, like a swarm of bees or wasps, are generated within us by selfish­ ness and peevishness, luxury and softness.", "3574": "And so nothing causes us to be mild to our servants and wife and friends so much as easiness and simplicity, and the learning to be content with what we have, and not to require a quantity of superfluities.", "3575": "\"", "3576": "He who likes not his meat if over-roast", "3577": "Or over-boiled, or under-roast or under-boiled, And never praises it however dressed,\" but will not drink unless he have snow to cool his drink, nor eat bread purchased in the market, nor touch food served on cheap or earthenware plates, nor sleep upon any but a feather bed that rises and falls like the sea stirred up from its depths, and with rods and blows hastens his servants at table, so that they run about and cry out and sweat as if they were bringing poultices to sores, be is slave to a weak querulous and discontented mode of life, and, like one who has a continual cough or various ailments, whether he is aware of it or not, he is in an ulcerous and catarrh-like condition as regards his prone­ ness to anger.", "3578": "We must therefore train the body to con­ tentment by plain living, that it may be easily satisfied:", "3579": "for they that require little do not miss much;", "3580": "and it is no great hardship to begin with our food, and take it silently whatever it is, and not by being choleric and peevish to thrust upon ourselves and friends the worst sauce to meat, anger. \"", "3581": "No more unpleasant supper could there be ” 1 than that wherein the servants are beaten, and the wife scolded, because something is burnt or smoked or not salt enough, or because the bread is too cold.", "3582": "Arcesilaus was once entertaining some friends and strangers, and when dinner was served, there was no bread, through the ser­ vants having neglected to buy any.", "3583": "In such a case as this which of us would not have broken the walls with vocife­ ration ?", "3584": "But he only smiled and said, “ How unfit a sage is to give an entertainment! \"", "3585": "And when Socrates once took Euthydemus home with him from the wrestling- school, Xanthippe was in a towering rage, and scolded, and at last upset the table, and Euthydemus rose and went away full of sorrow.", "3586": "But Socrates said to him, \" Did not a hen at your house the other day fly in and act in the very same way ?", "3587": "And we did not put ourselves out about it.\"", "3588": "We ought to receive our friends with gaiety and smiles and welcome, not knitting our brows, or inspiring fear and trembling in the attendants.", "3589": "We ought also to accustom ourselves to the use of any kind of ware at table, and not to stint ourselves to one kind rather than another, as some pick out a particular tankard or horn, as they say Marius did, out of many, and will not drink out of anything else;", "3590": "and some act in the same way with regard to oil-flasks and scrapers,2 being content with only one out of all, and so, if such an article is broken or lost, they are very much put out about it, and punish with severity.", "3591": "He then that is prone to anger should not use rare and dainty things, such as choice cups and seals and precious stones:", "3592": "for if they are lost they put a man beside himself much more than the loss of ordinary and easily got things would do.", "3593": "And so when Nero had got an eight-cor­ nered tent constructed, a wonderful object both for its beauty and costliness, Seneca said to him, \"You have now shown yourself to be poor, for if you should lose this, you will not be able to procure such anotber.\"", "3594": "And indeed it did so happen that the tent was lost by shipwreck, but Nero bore its loss patiently, remembering what Seneca had said.", "3595": "Now this easiness about things generally makes a man also easy and gentle to his servants, and if to them, then it is clear he will be so to his friends also, and to all that serve under him in any capacity.",

blamed, if it is an answer to some charge or calumny, as those words of Pericles, \" And yet you are angry with such a man as me, a man I take it inferior to no one either in knowledge of what should be done, or in ability to point out the same, and a lover of my country to boot, and superior to bribes.\"", "4026": "1 For not only did he avoid all swagger and vainglory and ambi­ tion in talking thus loftily about himself, but he also exhi- bited the spirit and greatness of his virtue, which could abase and crush envy because it could not be abased itself.", "4027": "For people will hardly condemn such men, for they are elevated and cheered and inspired by noble self-laudation such as this, if it have a true basis, as all history testifies.", "4028": "Thus the Thebans, when their generals were charged with not returning home, and laying down their office of Bœotarchs when their time had expired, but instead of that making inroads into Laconia, and helping Messene, hardly acquitted Pelopidas, who was submissive and sup­ pliant, but for Epaminondas,1 who gloried in what he had done, and at last said that he was ready to die, if they would confess that he had ravaged Laconia, and restored Messene, and made Arcadia one state, against the will of the Thebans, they would not pass sentence upon him, but admired his heroism, and with rejoicing and smiles set him free.", "4029": "So too we must not altogether find fault with Sthenelus in Homer saying, \" We boast ourselves far better than our fathers,\"3 when we remember the words of Agamemnon, \" How now ?",

pleased at Cicero's frequently passing encomiums upon himself in the affair of Catiline, yet when Scipio said they ought not to try him (Scipio), since he had given them the power to try anybody, they put on garlands, and accompanied him to the Capitol, and sacrificed with him.", "4036": "For Cicero was not compelled to praise himself, but only did so for glory, whereas the danger in which Scipio stood removed envy from him.", "4037": "§ v.", "4038": "And not only on one's trial and in danger, but also in misfortune, is tall talk and boasting more suitable than in prosperity.", "4039": "For in prosperity people seem to clutch as it were at glory and enjoy it, and so gratify their ambition ;", "4040": "but in adversity, being far from ambition owing to circum­ stances, such self-commendation seems to be a bearing up and fortifying the spirit against fortune, and an avoidance altogether of that desire for pity and condolence, and that humility, which we often find in adversity.", "4041": "As then we esteem those persons vain and without sense who in walking hold themselves very erect and with a stiff neck, yet in boxing or fighting we commend such as bold themselves up and alert, so the man struggling with adversity, who stands up straight against his fate, \" in fighting posture like some boxer,\"1 and instead of being humble and abject becomes through his boasting lofty and dignified, seems to be not offensive and impudent, but great and invincible.", "4042": "This is why, I suppose, Homer has represented Patroclus modest and without reproach in prosperity, yet at the

But since most people very much dislike and object to a man's praising himself, but if he praises some one else are on the contrary often glad and readily bear him out, some are in, the habit of

his power, and the trophies and vic­ tories and towns he had won for Athens, and was leaving as a legacy, he raised himself up a little and blamed them as praising him for things common to many, and some of them the results of fortune rather than merit, while they had passed over the best and greatest of his deeds and one peculiarly his own, that he had never been the cause of any Athenian's wearing mourning.", "4093": "This gives the orator an example, if he be a good man, when praised for his eloquence, to transfer the praise to his life and character, and the general who is admired for his skill and good fortune in war to speak with confidence about his gentle­ ness and uprightness.", "4094": "And again, if any very extravagant praise is uttered, such as many people use in flattery

philanthropy.", "4096": "For even envy is not reluctant to give moderate praise to one that depre­ cates excessive praise, and true panegyric is not lost by people refusing to accept idle and false praise.", "4097": "So those kings who would not be called gods or the sons of gods, but only fond of their brothers or mother, or benefactors,3 or dear to the gods, did not excite the envy of those that honoured them by those titles, that were noble but still such as men might claim.", "4098": "Again, people dislike those writers or speakers who entitle themselves wise, but they wel- come those who content themselves with saying that they are lovers of philosophy, and have made some progress, or use some such moderate language about themselves as that, which does not excite envy.", "4099":

not to injure those who have weak eyes, draw a shade over too much light, so some people make their praise of themselves less glaring and absolute, by pointing out some of their small defects, or

possible comfort to the injured.", "4216": "And so I am often troubled when I consider that remark of Bias, who told, it seems, a bad man that he was not afraid that he would escape punishment, but that he would not live to see it.", "4217": "For how did the Messenians who were killed long before derive any benefit from the punish­ ment of Aristocrates ?", "4218": "For he had been guilty of treason at the battle of The Great Trench, but had reigned over the Arcadians for more than twenty years without being found out, but afterwards was detected and paid the penalty, but they were no longer alive.", "4219": "4", "4220": "Or what consolation was brought to the people of Orchomenus, who lost their sons and friends and relatives in consequence of the treason of Lyciscus, by the disease which settled upon him long after­ wards and spread all over his body ?", "4221": "For he used to go and dip and soak his feet in the river, and uttered imprecations and prayed that they might rot off if he was guilty of treason or crime.", "4222": "Nor was it permitted to the children's children of those that were slain to see at Athens the tear­ ing out of their graves the bodies of those atrocious crimi­ nals that had killed them, and the carrying them beyond their borders.", "4223": "And so it seems strange in Euripides using the following argument to deter people from vice :", "4224": "\"", "4225": "Fear not, for vengeance will not strike at once", "4226": "Your heart, or that of any guilty wretch, But silently and with slow foot it moves,1 And when their time's come will the wicked reach.\"", "4227": "This is no doubt the very reason why the wicked incite and cheer themselves on to commit lawless acts, for crime shows them a fruit visible and ripe at once, but a punish­ ment late, and long subsequent to the enjoyment.\"§ III.", "4228": "When Patrocleas had said thus much, Olympicus interfered, \" There is another consideration, Patrocleas, the great absurdity involved in these delays and longsuffering of the deity.", "4229": "For the slowness of punishment takes away belief in providence, and the wicked, observing that no evil follows each crime except long afterwards, attri­ bute it when it comes to mischance, and look upon it in the light more of accident than punishment, and so receive no benefit from it, being grieved indeed when the misfortune comes, but feeling no remorse for what they have done amiss.", "4230": "For, as in the case of a horse, the whip­ ping or spurring that immediately follows upon a stumble or some other fault is a corrective and brings him to his duty, but pulling and backing him with the bit and shouting at him long afterwards seems to come from some other motive than a desire to teach him, for he is put to pain without being shown his fault;", "4231": "so the vice which each time it stumbles or offends is at once punished and checked by correction is most likely2 to coma to itself and be humble and stand in awe of the deity, as one that beholds men's acts and passions and does not punish behind time;", "4232": "whereas that justice that, according to Euripides, \" steals on silently and with slow foot,\" and falls upon the wicked some time or other, seems to resemble more chance than providence by reason of its uncertainty, delay, and irregularity.", "4233": "So that I do not see what benefit there is in those mills of the gods that are said to grind late,1 since they obscure the punishment, and obliterate the fear, of evil-doing.\"§ iv.", "4234": "When Olympicus had done speaking, and I was musing with myself on the matter, Tim on said, \" Am I to put the finishing touch of difficulty on our subject, or am I to let him first contend earnestly against these views ? \"", "4235": "Then said I, \" Why should we bring up the third wave 2 and drown the argument, if he is not able to refute or evade the charges already brought ?", "4236": "To begin then with the domestic hearth, as the saying is,3 let us imitate that cautious manner of speaking about the deity in vogue among the Academic philosophers, and decline to speak about these things as if we thoroughly understood them.", "4237": "For it is worse in us mortals than for people ignorant of music to discuss music, or for people ignorant of military matters to discuss the art of war, to examine too closely into the nature of the gods and demons, like people with no knowledge of art trying to get at the intention of artists from opinion and fancy and probabilities.", "4238": "For if4 it is no easy matter for anyone not a professional to conjecture why the surgeon performed an operation later rather than sooner, or why he ordered his patient to take a bath to-day rather than yesterday, how is it easy or safe for a mortal to say anything else about the deity than that he knows best the time to cure vice, and applies to each his punishment as the doctor administers a drug, and that a punishment not of the same magnitude, or applied at the same time, in all cases.", "4239": "For that the cure of the soul, which is called justice, is the greatest of all arts is testified by Pindar as well as by ten thousand others, for be calls God, the ruler and lord of all things, the greatest artificer as the creator of justice, whose function it is to determine when, and how, and how far, each bad man is to be punished.", "4240": "And Plato says that Minos, the son of Zeus, was his father's pupil in this art, not thinking it possible that any one could succeed in justice, or understand how to succeed in it, without he had learned or somehow got that science.", "4241": "For the laws which men make are not always merely reasonable, nor is their meaning always apparent, but some injunctions seem quite ridiculous, for example, the Ephors at Lacedæmon make proclamation, directly they take office, that no one is to let his moustache grow, but that all are to obey the laws, that they be not grievous to them.", "4242": "And the Romans lay a light rod on the bodies of those they make freemen, and when they make their wills, they nominate some as their heirs, while to others they sell the property, which seems strange.", "4243": "But strangest of all is that ordinance of Solon, that the citizen who, when his city is in faction, will not side with either party is to lose his civic rights.", "4244": "And generally one might mention many absurdities in laws, if one did not know the mind of the legislator, or understand the reason for each particular piece of legislation.", "4245": "How is it wonderful then, if human affairs are so difficult to comprehend, that it is no easy task to say in connection with the gods, why they punish some offenders early, and others late ?§ v.", "4246": "This is not a pretext for evading the subject, but merely a request for lenient judgement, that our discourse, looking as it were for a haven and place of refuge, may rise to the difficulty with greater confidence basing itself on probability.", "4247": "Consider then first that, according to Plato, god, making himself openly a pattern of all things good, concedes human virtue, which is in some sort a resem­ blance to himself, to those who are able to follow him.", "4248": "For all nature, being in disorder, got the principle of change and became order1 by a resemblance to and participation in the nature and virtue of the deity.", "4249": "The same Plato also tells us that nature put eyesight into us, in order that the soul by beholding and admiring the heavenly bodies might accustom itself to welcome and love harmony and order, and might hate disorderly and roving propensities, and avoid aimless reliance on chance, as the parent of all vice and error.", "4250": "For man can enjoy no greater blessing from god than to attain to virtue by the earnest imitation of the noblest qualities of the divine nature.", "4251": "And so he punishes the wicked leisurely and long after, not being afraid of error or after repentance through punishing too hastily, but to take away from us that eager and brutish thirst for revenge, and to teach us that we are not to reta­ liate on those that have offended us in anger, and when the soul is most inflamed and distorted with passion and almost beside itself for rage, like people satisfying fierce thirst or hunger, but to imitate the mildness and long-suffering of the deity, and to avenge ourselves in an orderly and decent manner, only when we have taken counsel with time long enough to give us the least possible likelihood of after repentance.", "4252": "For it is a smaller evil, as Socrates said, to drink dirty water when excessively thirsty, than, when one's mind is disturbed and full of rage and fury, before it is settled and becomes pure, to glut our revenge on the person of a relation and kinsman.", "4253": "For it is not the punish­ ment that follows as closely as possible upon wrong-doing, as Thucydides said,1 but that which is more remote, that observes decorum.", "4254": "For as Melanthius says of anger, \" Fell things it does when it the mind unsettles,\" 2 so also reason acts with justice and moderation, when it banishes rage and passion.", "4255": "So also people are made milder by the example of other men, as when they hear that Plato, when he held his stick over his slave to correct him, waited some time, as he himself has told us, to compose his anger;", "4256": "and that Archytas, having learned of some wrong or dis­ orderly action on the part of some of his farm labourers, knowing that at the time be was in a very great rage and highly incensed at them, did nothing to them, but merely departed, saying, \" You may thank your stars that I am in a rnge with you.\"", "4257": "If then the remembrance of the words and recorded acts of men abates the fierceness and intensity of our rage, much more likely is it that we (observing that the deity, though without either fear or repentance in any case, yet puts off his punishments and defers them for some time) shall be reserved in our views about such matters, and shall think that mildness and long-suffering which the god exhibits a divine part of virtue, reforming a few by speedy punishment, but benefiting and correcting many by a tardy one.§", "4258": "VI.", "4259": "Let us consider in the second place that punish­ ments inflicted by men for offences regard only retaliation, and, when the offender is punished, stop and go no further;", "4260": "so that they seem to follow offences yelping at them like a dog, and closely pursuing at their heels as it were.", "4261": "But it is likely that the deity would look at the state of any guilty soul that he intended to punish, if haply it might turn and repent, and would give1 time for reformation to all whose vice was not absolute and incurable.", "4262": "For knowing bow great a share of virtue souls come into the world with, deriving it from him, and how strong and lasting is their nobility of nature, and how it breaks out into vice against its natural disposition through the corruption of bad habits and companions, and afterwards in some cases reforms itself, and recovers its proper position, he does not inflict punish­ ment on all persons alike;", "4263": "but the incorrigible he at once removes from life and cuts off, since it is altogether in­ jurious to others, but most of all to a man's own self, to live in perpetual vice, whereas to those who seem to have fallen into wrong-doing, rather from ignorance of what was good than from deliberate choice of what was bad, he gives time to repent.", "4264": "But if they persist in vice he punishes them too, for he has no fear that they will escape him.", "4265": "Consider also how many changes take place in the life and character of men, so that the Greeks give the names τρόπος and ἦθος to the character, the first word meaning change, and the latter the immense force and power of habit.", "4266": "I think also that the ancients called Cecrops half man and half dragon2 not because, as some say, he became from a good king wild and dragon-like, but contrariwise because he was originally perverse and terrible, and afterwards became a mild and humane king.", "4267": "And if this is uncertain, at any rate we know that Gelon and Hiero, both Sicilians, and Pisistratus the son of Hippocrates, though they got their supreme power by bad means, yet used it for virtuous ends, and though they mounted the throne in an irregular way, yet became good and useful princes.", "4268": "For by good legislation and by encouraging agriculture they made the citizens earnest and industrious instead of scoffers and chatterers.", "4269": "As for Gelon, after fighting valiantly and defeating the Carthaginians in a great battle, he would not conclude with them the peace they asked for until they inserted an article promising to cease sacrificing their sons to Cronos.", "4270": "And Lydiades was tyrant in Megalopolis, yet in the very height of his power chang­ ing his ideas and being disgusted with injustice, he re­ stored their old constitution to the citizens,1 and fell glo­ riously, fighting against the enemy in behalf of his country.", "4271": "And if any one had slain prematurely Miltiades the tyrant of the Chersonese, or had prosecuted and got a conviction against Cimon for incest with his sister, or had deprived Athens of Themistocles for his wantonness and revellings and outrages in the market, as in later days Athens lost Alci­ biades, by an indictment, should we not have had to go without the glory of Marathon, and Eurymedon, and beautiful Artemisium, \" where the Athenian youth laid the bright base of liberty ?\"2 For great natures produce nothing little, nor can their energy and activity rust owing to their keen intellect, but they toss to and fro as at sea till they come to a settled and durable character.", "4272": "As then one inexperienced in farming, seeing a spot full of thick bushes and rank growth, full of wild beasts and streams and mud, would not think much of it, while to one who has learnt how to discriminate and discern between different kind of soils all these are various tokens of the richness and goodness of the land, so great natures break out into many strange excesses, which exasperate us at first beyond bear­ ing, so that we think it right to cut off such offenders and stop their career at once, whereas a better judge, seeing the good and noble even in these, waits for age and the season which nature appoints for gathering fruit to bring sense and virtue.", "4273": "§ vii.", "4274": "So much for this point.", "4275": "Do you not think also that some of the Greeks did well to adopt that Egyptian law which orders a pregnant woman condemned to death not to suffer the penalty till after she has given birth ? \" \" Certainly,\" said all the company.", "4276": "I continued, \" Put the case not of a woman pregnant, but of a man who can in process of time bring to light and reveal some secret act or plan, point out some unknown evil, or devise some scheme of safety, or invent something useful and necessary, would it not be better to defer his execution, and wait the result of his meditation ?", "4277": "That is my opinion, at least.\" \" So we all think,\" said Patrocleas.", "4278": "\" Quite right,\" said I. \"", "4279": "For do but consider, had Dionysius had vengeance taken on him at the beginning of his tyranny, none of the Greeks would have dwelt in Sicily, which was laid waste by the Carthaginians.", "4280": "Nor would the Greeks have dwelt in Apollonia, or Anactorium, or the peninsula of the Leuca­ dians, had not Periander's chastisement been postponed for a long time.", "4281": "I think also that Cassander's punishment was deferred that Thebes might be repeopled.", "4282": "And of the mercenaries that plundered this very temple most crossed .", "4283": "over into Sicily with Timoleon, and after they had con­ quered the Carthaginians and put down their authority, perished miserably, miserable wretches that they were.", "4284": "For no doubt the deity makes use of some wicked men, as exe­ cutioners, to punish others, and so I think he crashes as it were most tyrants.", "4285": "For as the gall of the hyena and rennet of the seal, both nasty beasts in all other respects, are useful in certain diseases, so when some need sharp correction, the deity casts upon them the implacable fury of some tyrant, or the savage ferocity of some prince, and does not remove the bane and trouble till their fault be got rid of and purged.", "4286": "Such a potion was Phalaris to the Agrigentines, and Marius to the Romans.", "4287": "And to the people of Sicyon the god distinctly foretold that their city needed a scourge, when they took away from the Cleonæans (as if he was a Sicyonian) the lad Teletias, who was crowned in the Pythian games, and tore him to pieces.", "4288": "As for the Sicyonians, Orthagoras became their tyrant, and subse­ quently Myro and Clisthenes, and these three checked their wanton outbreaks;", "4289": "but the Cleonæans, not getting such a cure, went to ruin.", "4290": "Yon have of course heard Homer's lines, \" ' From a bad father sprang a son far better, Excelling in all

upon, so great was their hatred of him.", "4294": "How is it strange then, since the farmer does not cut down the thorn till he has taken his asparagus, nor do the Libyans burn the twigs till they

the Phocians to have lost ten thousand of the oxen and horses of Iphitus, and for more gold and silver to have gone from Delphi, than that Odysseus and Æsculapius should not have been born, nor those

the fitting manner rather than quickly and on the spur of the moment ?", "4298": "Consider the case of Callippus, who with the very dagger with which be slew Dion, pretending to be his friend, was afterwards slain by his own friends.", "4299": "And when Mitius the Argive was killed in a tumult, a brazen statue in the market-place fell on his murderer and killed him during the public games.", "4300": "And of course, Patrocleas, you know all about Bessus the Pæonian, and about Aristo the Œtæan leader of mercenaries.\"", "4301": "\" Not I, by Zeus,\" said Patrocleas, \"but I should like to

supposing, as has been laid down, that there is a deferring of punish­ ment to the wicked;", "4308": "and, for the rest, I think we ought to listen to Hesiod, who tells us—not like Plato, who asserts that punishment is a condition that follows crime— that it is contemporaneous with it, and grows with it from the same source and root.", "4309": "For Hesiod says, \" Evil advice is worst to the

penalty of his crime in his person bears his cross, so vice fabricates for itself each of its own torments, being the terrible author of its own misery in life, wherein in addition to shame it has frequent fears and fierce passions and endless remorse and anxiety.", "4315": "But some are just like children, who, seeing malefactors in the theatres in golden tunics and purple robes with crowns on and dancing, admire them and marvel at them, thinking them happy, till they see them goaded and lashed and issuing fire from their gaudy but cheap garments.", "4316": "1", "4317": "For most wicked people, though they have great households and conspicuous offices and great power, are yet being secretly punished before they are seen to be murdered or hurled down rocks, which is rather the climax and end of their punishment than the punishment itself.", "4318": "For as Plato tells us that Herodicus the Selymbrian having fallen into consumption, an incurable disease, was the first of mankind to mix exercise with the art of healing, and so prolonged his own life and that of others suffering from the same disease, so those wicked persons who seem to avoid immediate punishment, receive a longer and not slower punishment, not later but extend­ ing over a wider period;", "4319": "for they are not punished in their old age, but rather grow old in perpetual punishment.", "4320": "I speak of course of long time as a human being, for to the gods all the period of man's life is as nothing, and so to them ' now and not thirty years ago' means no more than with us torturing or hanging a malefactor in the evening instead of the morning would mean ;", "4321": "especially as man is shut up in life as in a prison from which there is no egress or escape, and though doubtless during his

the punishment, and ignore all the inter­ mediate sufferings and fears and anxiety and remorse, the destiny of every guilty wretch ?", "4324": "That would be arguing that the fish that has swallowed the hook is not caught, till we see it boiled by the cook or sliced at table.", "4325": "For every wrong-doer is liable to punishment, and soon swallows the pleasantness of his wrong-doing like a bait, while his conscience still vexes and troubles him, \" As through the sea the impetuous tunny darts.\"", "4326": "For the recklessness and audacity of vice is strong and ram­ pant till the crime is committed, but afterwards, when the passion subsides like a storm, it becomes timid and dejected and a prey to fears and superstitions.", "4327": "So that Stesichorus in his account of Clytæmnestra's dream may have repre­ sented the facts and real state of the case, where he says, \" A dragon seemed to appear to her with its lofty head smeared all over with blood, and out of it

dead could be summoned, and by propitiations and sacrifices called up the soul of the maiden, and she appeared to him and told him that this trouble would end when he got to Lacedæmon, and directly he got there he died.\"1§ xi. \"", "4334": "And so, if nothing happens to the soul after death, but that event is the end of all enjoyment or punishment, one would be rather inclined to say that the deity was lax and indulgent in quickly punishing the wicked and depriving them of life.", "4335": "For even if we were to say that the wicked had no other trouble in a long life, yet, when their wrong-doing was proved to bring them no profit or enjoyment, no good or adequate return for their many and great anxieties, the consciousness of that would be quite enough to throw 2 their mind off its balance.", "4336": "So they record of Lysimachus tint he was so overcome by thirst that he surrendered himself and his forces to the Getæ for some drink, but after he had drunk and bethought him

nature.", "4339": "But when a man, either for the love of money, or for political place or power, or carried away by some amorous propen­ sity, does some lawless and dreadful deed, and, after his eager desire is satisfied, sees in process of time that only the base and terrible elements of his crime remain, while nothing useful, or necessary, or advantageous has flowed from it, is it not likely that the idea would often present itself to him that, moved by vain-glory, or for some illiberal and unlovely pleasure, he bad violated the greatest and noblest rights of mankind, and had filled his life with shame and trouble ?", "4340": "For as Simonides used to say play­ fully that he always found his money-chest full but his gratitude-chest empty,3 so the wicked contemplating their own vice soon find out that their gratification is joyless and hopeless,4 and ever attended by fears and griefs and gloomy memories, and suspicions about the future, and dis­ trust about the present.", "4341": "Thus we hear Ino, repenting for what she had done, saying on the stage, \" Dear women, would that I could now inhabit", "4342": "For the first time the house of Athamas, Guiltless

praise his destroying the city of the Branchidæ and putting everybody in it to death because their great-grandfathers betrayed the temple at Miletus.", "4365": "1", "4366": "And Agathocles, the tyrant of Syra­ cuse, laughing and jeering at the Corcyræans for asking him why he wasted their island, replied, “ Because, by Zens, your forefathers welcomed Odysseus.\"", "4367": "And when the people of Ithaca likewise complained of his soldiers carrying off their sheep, he said, \" Your king came to us, and actually put out the shepherd's eye to boot.”", "4368": "2", "4369": "And is it not stranger still in Apollo punishing the present inha­ bitants of Pheneus, by damming up the channel dug to carry off their watery and so flooding the whole of their district, because a thousand years ago, they

begun the practice of wearing mourning and grieving for him.", "4376": "And yet this would be only folly, there would be nothing dreadful or fatal about it, but what should make the anger of the gods

subject presents the same difficulty?\" \" Perhaps,\" said I, \"it is as with those in a raging fever, whether they have few or many clothes on the bed they are equally hot or nearly so, yet to ease them we shall do well to remove some of the clothes ;", "4379": "but let us waive this point, if you don't like the line of argument, though a good deal of what you have said seems myth and fable, and let us recall to our minds the recent festival in honour of Apollo called Theoxenia,1 and the noble share in it which the heralds expressly reserve for the descendants of Pindar, and how grand and pleasant it seemed to you.\"", "4380": "\" Who could help being pleased,\" said he, \" with such a delightful honour, so Greek and breathing the simple spirit of an­ tiquity, had he not, to use

your ancestor Daiphantus,3 and you were the first to give me help and assistance in preserving for the Lycormæ and Satilæi their hereditary privilege of wearing crowns as descendants of Hercules, when I contended that we ought to confirm the honours and favours of the descendants of Hercules more especially because, though he was such a benefactor to the Greeks, he had had himself no adequate favour or return.\"", "4383": "“You remind me,\" be said, \"of a noble effort, and one well worthy of a philosopher.\" \" Dismiss then,\" said I, \"my dear fellow, your vehement accusation against the gods, and do not be so vexed that some of a bad or evil stock are punished by them, or else do not joy in and approve of the honour paid to descent from a good stock.", "4384": "For it is unreasonable, if wo continue to show favour to a virtuous stock, to think punishment wrong in the case of a criminal stock, or that it should not correspond with the adequate reward of merit.", "4385": "And he that is glad to see the descendants of Cimon honoured at Athens, but is displeased and indignant that the descen­ dants of Lachares or Aristo are in exile, is too soft and easy, or rather too fault-finding and peevish with the gods, accusing them if the descendants of a bad and wicked man are fortunate, and accusing them also if the progeny of the bad are wiped off the face of

full of mazes and labyrinths, let us warily and calmly follow the track to what is probable and plausible, for certainty and truth are things very difficult to find even in every-day life.", "4389": "For example, why are the children of those that have died of consumption or dropsy bidden to sit with their feet in water till the dead body is burnt ?", "4390": "For that is thought to prevent the disease transferring itself to them.", "4391": "Again, when a she-goat takes a bit of eringo into her mouth, why do the whole herd stand still, till the goatherd comes up and takes it out of her mouth

"4393": "But we marvel more at intervals of time than place.", "4394": "And yet is it more wonderful that Athens should have been smitten with a plague2 that started in Arabia, and of which Pericles died and Thucydides fell sick, than that, when the Delphians and Sybarites became wicked, vengeance should have fallen on their descendants.", "4395": "8", "4396": "For properties have relations and connections between ends and beginnings, and although the reason of them may not be known by us, they silently perform their errand.\"§ xv. \"", "4397": "Moreover the public punishments of cities by the gods admits of a just defence.", "4398": "For a city is one continuous entity, a sort of creature that never changes from age, or be­ comes different by time, but is ever sympathetic with and conformable to itself, and is answerable for whatever it does or has done for the public weal, as long as the community by its union and federal bonds preserves its unity.", "4399": "For he that would make several, or rather any quantity of, cities out of one by process of time would be like a person who made one human being several, by regarding him now as an old man, now as a young man, now as a stripling.", "4400": "Or rather this kind of reasoning resembles the arguments of Epicharmus, from whom the sophists borrowed the piled­ up method of reasoning,1 for example, he incurred the debt long ago, so he does not owe it now, being a different person, or, be was invited to dinner yesterday, but he comes uninvited to-day, for he is another person.", "4401": "And yet age produces greater changes in any individual than it does commonly in cities.", "4402": "For any one would recognize Athens again if he had not seen it for thirty years, for the present habits and feelings of the people there, their business, amusements, likes and dislikes, are just what they were long ago;", "4403": "whereas a man's friend or acquaintance meeting him after some time would hardly recognize his appear­ ance, for the change of character easily introduced by every thought and deed, feeling and custom, produce a wonderful strangeness and novelty in the same person.", "4404": "And yet a man is reckoned to be the same person from birth to death, and similarly we think it right for a city always remaining the same to be liable to reproach for the ill deeds of its former inhabitants, on the same principle as it enjoys its ancient glory and power ;", "4405": "or shall we, without being aware of it, throw everything into Heraclitus' river, into which he says a person cannot step twice,2 since nature is ever changing and altering everything ?", "4406": "\"§ XVI. “", "4407": "If then a city is one continuous entity, so of course is a race that starts from one beginning, that can trace back intimate union and similarity of faculties, for that which is begot is not, like some production of art, unlike the begetter, for it proceeds from him, and is not merely produced by him, so that it appropriately receives his share, whether that be honour or punishment.", "4408": "And if I should not seem to be trifling, I should say that the bronze statue of Cassander melted down by the Athenians, and the body of Dionysius thrown out of their territory by the Syra­ cusans after his death, were treated more unjustly than punishing their posterity would have been.", "4409": "For there was none of the nature of Cassander in the statue, and the soul of Dionysius had left his dead body before this outrage, whereas Nysæus and Apollocrates,1 Antipater and Philip,2 and similarly other sons of wicked parents had innate in them a good deal of their fathers, and that no listless or inactive element, but one by which they lived and were nourished, and by which their ideas were controlled.", "4410": "Nor is it at all strange or absurd that some should have their fathers' characteristics.", "4411": "And to speak generally, as in surgery whatever is useful is also just, and that person would be ridiculous who should say it was unjust to cauterize the thumb when the hip-joints were in pain, and to lance the stomach when the liver was inflamed, or when oxen were tender in their hoofs to anoint the tips of their horns, so he that looks for any other justice in punish­ ment than curing vice, and is dissatisfied if surgery is em.", "4412": "ployed to one part to benefit another, as surgeons open a, vein to relieve ophthalmia, can see nothing beyond the evi­ dence of the senses, and does not remember that even a schoolmaster by correcting one lad admonishes others,

through the body, come certain dispositions, and vices or improvement of character.", "4414": "For just as it is likely in the case of the body that the same feelings and changes will take place, so the soul, being worked upon by fancies, naturally becomes better or worse according as it has more confidence or fear.\"§ XVII.", "4415": "While I was thus speaking, Olympicus interposed, and said, \" You seem in your argument to assume the im­ portant assumption of the permanence of the soul.\"", "4416": "I replied, \" Yon too concede it, or rather did concede it.", "4417": "For that the deity deals with everyone according to his merit has been the assumption of our argument from the begin­ ning.\"", "4418": "Then said he, \" Do you think that it follows, because the gods notice our actions and deal with us accordingly, that souls are either altogether imperishable, or for some time survive dissolution ?\"", "4419": "Then said I, \" Not exactly so, my good sir, but is the deity so little and so attached to trifles, if we have nothing divine in our­ selves, nothing resembling him, nothing lasting or sure, but that we all do fade as a leaf, as Homer 1 says, and die after a brief life, as to take the trouble--like women that tend and cultivate their gardens of Adonis 2 in pots-to create souls to flourish in a delicate body having no stability only for a day, and then to be annihilated at once3 by any occasion ?", "4420": "And if you please, leaving the other gods out of the question, consider the case of our god here.", "4421": "4", "4422": "Does it seem likely to you that, if he knew that the souls of the dead perish immediately, and glide out of their bodies like mist or smoke, he would enjoin many propitiatory offer­ ings for the departed and honours for the dead, merely cheating and beguiling those that believed in him ?", "4423": "For my own part, I shall never abandon my belief in the per­ manence of the soul, unless some second Hercules IS shall come and take away the tripod of the Pythian Priestess, and abolish and destroy the oracle.", "4424": "For as long as many such oracles are still given, as was said to be given to Corax of Naxos formerly, it is impious to declare that the soul dies.\"", "4425": "Then said Patrocleas, \" What oracle do you refer too ?", "4426": "Who was this Corax ?", "4427": "To me both the occur­ rence and name are quite strange.\" \" That cannot be,\" said I, \" but I am to blame for using the surname instead of the name.", "4428": "For he that killed Archilochus in battle was called Calondes, it seems, but his surname was Corax.", "4429": "He was first rejected by the Pythian Priestess, as having slain a man sacred to the Muses, but after using many entreaties and prayers, and urging pleas in defence of his act, he was ordered to go to the dwelling of Tettix, and appease the soul of Archilochus.", "4430": "Now this place was Tænarum, for there they say Tettix the Cretan had gone with a fleet and founded a city, and dwelt near the place where departed souls were conjured up.", "4431": "Similarly also, when the Spartans were bidden by the oracle to appease the soul of Pausanias, the necromancers were summoned from Italy, and, after they had offered sacrifice, they got the ghost out of the temple.\"§ XVIII.", "4432": "\"It is one and the same argument,\" I continued, “ that confirms the providence of the deity and the perma­ nence of the soul of man, so that you cannot leave one if you take away the other.", "4433": "And if the soul survives after death, it makes the probability stronger that rewards or punishments will be assigned to it.", "4434": "For during life the soul struggles, like an athlete, and when the struggle is over, then it gets its deserts.", "4435": "But what rewards or punishments the soul gets when by itself in the unseen world for the deeds done in the body has nothing to do with us that are alive, and is perhaps not credited by us, and certainly unknown to us;", "4436": "whereas those punishments that come on descen­ dants and on the race are evident to all that are alive, and deter and keep back many from wickedness.", "4437": "For there is no more disgraceful or bitter punishment than to see our chil­ dren in misfortune through our faults, and if the soul of an impious or lawless man could see after death, not his statues or honours taken from him, but his children or friends or race in great adversity owing to him, and pay­ ing the penalty for his misdeeds, no one would ever persuade him, could he come to life again, to be unjust and licen­ tious, even for the honours of Zeus.", "4438": "I could tell you a story on this head, which I recently heard, but I hesitate to do so, lest you should regard it only as a myth;", "4439": "I

wicked for their fathers' crimes is more ridiculous than a doctor administering a potion to a son or grandson for a fathers or grandfather's disease.", "4444": "But the cases, though in some respects similar and like, are in others dissimilar.", "4445": "For to cure one person of a disease does not cure another, nor is one any better, when suffering from ophthalmia or fever, by seeing another anointed or poulticed.", "4446": "But the punishments of evil-doors are exhibited to everybody for this reason, that it is the function of justice, when it is carried out as reason dictates, to check some by the punish­ ment of others.", "4447": "So that Dion did -not see in what respect his comparison touched our subject.", "4448": "For sometimes, when a man falls into a grievous but not incurable malady, which afterwards by intemperance and negligence ruins his consti­ tution and kills him, is not his son, who is not supposed to be suffering from the same malady but only to have a predis­ position for it, enjoined to a careful manner of living by his medical man, or friend, or intelligent trainer in gymnastics, or honest guardian, and recommended to abstain from fish and pastry, wine and women, and to take medicine fre­ quently, and to go in for training in the gymnasiums, and so to dissipate and get rid of the small seeds of what might be a serious malady, if he allowed it to come to a head ?", "4449": "Do we not indeed give advice of this kind to the children of diseased fathers or mothers, bidding them take care and be cautious and not to neglect themselves, but at once to arrest the first germ of the malady, nipping it in the bud while removable, and before it has got a firm footing in the con­ stitution ? ” “ Certainly we do,\" said all the company. \"", "4450": "We are not then,\" I continued, \" acting in a strange or ridiculous but in a necessary and useful way, in arranging their exercise and food and physic for the sons of epileptic or atrabilious or gouty people, not when they are ill, but to pre­ vent their becoming so.", "4451": "For the offspring of a poor consti­ tution does not require punishment, but it does require medical treatment and care, and if any one stigmatizes this, because it curtails pleasure and involves some self-denial and pain, as a punishment inflicted by cowardice and timidity, we care not for his opinion.", "4452": "Can it be right to tend and care for the body that has an hereditary predisposition to some malady, and are we to neglect the growth and spread in the young character of hereditary taint of vice, and to dally with it, and wait till it be plainly mixed up with the feelings, and, to use the language of Pindar, “ produce malignant fruit in the heart ?", "4453": "\"§ xx.", "4454": "Or is the deity in this respect no wiser than Hesiod, who exhorts and advises, \" not to beget children on our return from a sad funeral, but after a banquet with the gods,\" 1 as though not vice or virtue only, but sorrow or joy and all other propensities, came from generation, to which the poet bids us come gay and agreeable and sprightly.", "4455": "But it is not Hesiod's function, or the work of human wisdom, but it belongs to the deity, to discern and accurately distinguish similarities and differences of character, before they become obvious by resulting in crime through the influence of the passions.", "4456": "For the young of bears and wolves and apes manifest from their birth the nature innate in them in all its naked simplicity;", "4457": "whereas man­ kind, under the influence of customs and opinions and laws, frequently conceal their bad qualities and imitate what is good, so as altogether to obliterate and escape from the innate taint of vice, or to be undetected for a long time, throwing the veil of craft round their real nature, so that we are scarce conscious of their villainy till we feel the blow or smart of some unjust action, so that we are in fact only aware that there is such a thing as injustice when men act unjustly, or as vice when men act viciously, or as cowardice when men run away, just as if one were to sup­ pose that scorpions had a sting only when they stung us, or that vipers were venomous only when they bit us, which would be a very silly idea.", "4458": "For every bad man is not bad only when he breaks out into crime, but he has the seeds of vice in his nature, and is only vicious in act when he has opportunity and means, as opportunity makes the thief steal,2 and the tyrant violate the laws.", "4459": "But the deity is not ignorant of the nature and disposition of every man, inasmuch as by his very nature he can read the soul better than the body, and does not wait to punish violence in the act, or shamelessness in the tongue, or lasciviousness in the members.", "4460": "For he does not retaliate upon the wrong-doer as having been ill-treated by him, nor is he angry with the robber as having been plundered by him, nor does he hate the adulterer as having himself suffered from his licentious­ ness, but it is to cure him that be often punishes the adul­ terous or avaricious or unjust man in embryo, before he has had time to work out all his villainy, as we try to stop epileptic fits before they come on.§ xxi.", "4461": "Just now we were dissatisfied that the wicked were punished late and tardily, whereas at present we find fault with the deity for correcting the character and disposition of some before they commit crime, from our ignoring that the future deed may be worse and more dreadful than the past, and the hidden intention than the overt act;", "4462": "for we are not able fully to understand the reasons why it is better to leave some alone in their ill deeds, and to arrest others in the intention ;", "4463": "just as no doubt medicine is not appropriate in the case of some patients, which would be beneficial to others not ill, but yet perhaps in a more dangerous condition still.", "4464": "And so the gods do not visit all the offences of parents on their children, but if a good man is the son of a bad one, as the son of a sickly parent is sometimes of a good constitution, he is exempt from the punishment of his race, as not being a partici­ pator in its viciousness.", "4465": "But if a young man imitates his vicious race it is only right that he should inherit the punishment of their ill deeds, as he would their debts.", "4466": "For Antigonus was not punished for Demetrius, nor, of the old heroes,1 Phyleus for Augeas, or Nestor for Neleus, for though their sires were bad they were good, but those whose nature liked and approved the vices of their ances­ tors, these justice punished, taking vengeance on their simi­ larity in viciousness.", "4467": "For as the warts and moles and freckles of parents often skip a generation, and reappear in the grandsons and granddaughters, and as a Greek woman, that had a black baby and so was accused of adultery, found out that she was the great granddaughter of an Ethiopian,1 and as the son of Pytho the Nisibian who recently died, and who was said to trace his descent to the Sparti, had the birthmark on his body of the print of a spear the token of his race, which though long dormant had come up again as out of the deep, so frequently earlier generations conceal and suppress the mental idiosyncrasies and passions of their race, which afterwards nature causes to break out in other members of the family, and so dis­ plays the family bent either to vice or virtue.\"§ XXII.", "4468": "When I had said thus much I was silent, but Olympicus smiled and said, \" We do not praise you, lest we should seem to forget your promised story, as though what you had advanced was adequate proof enough, but we will give our opinion when we have heard it.\"", "4469": "Then I began as follows.", "4470": "\"", "4471": "Thespesius of Soli, an intimate friend of that Protogenes3 who lived in this city with us for some time, had been very profligate during the early part of his life, and had quickly run through his property, and for some time owing to his straits had given himself up to bad practices, when repenting of his old ways, and following the pursuit of riches, he resembled those profligate husbands that pay no attention to their wives while they live with them, but get rid of them, and then, after they have married other men, do all they can wickedly to seduce them.", "4472": "Ab­ staining then from nothing dishonourable that could bring either enjoyment or gain, in no long time he got together no great amount of property, but a very great reputation for villainy.", "4473": "But what most damaged his character was the answer he received from the oracle of Amphilochus.", "4474": "4", "4475": "For he sent it seems a messenger to consult the god whether he would live the rest of his life better, and the answer was be would do better after his death.", "4476": "And indeed this hap­ pened in a sense not long after.", "4477": "For he fell headlong down from a great height, and though he bad received no wound nor even a blow, the fall did for him, but

hardly credit it.", "4480": "For the Cilicians say that they know nobody who was in those days more fairdealing in business, or more devout to the deity, or more disagreeable to his enemies, or more faithful to his friends;", "4481": "insomuch that all who had any dealings with him desired to hear the reason of this change, not thinking that so great a reformation of character could have proceeded from chance, and their idea was correct, as his narrative to Protogenes and others of his great friends showed.", "4482": "For he told them that, when his soul left the body, the change he first underwent was as if he were a pilot thrown violently into the sea out of a ship.", "4483": "Then raising himself up a little, he thought he recovered the power of breathing again altogether, and looked round him in every direction, as if one eye of the soul was open.", "4484": "But he saw none of the things he had ever seen before, but stars enormous in size and at immense distance from one another, sending forth a wonderful and intense brightness of colour, so that the soul was borne along and moved about every­ where quickly and easily, like a ship in fair weather.", "4485": "But omitting most of the sights he saw, he said that the souls of the dead mounted into the air, which yielded to them and formed fiery bubbles, and then, when each bubble quietly broke, they assumed human forms, light in weight but with different kinds of motion, for some leapt about with wonder­ ful ability and darted straight upwards, while others like spindles flitted round all together in a circle, some in an upward direction, some in a downward, with mixed and confused motion, hardly stopping at all, or only after a very long time.", "4486": "As to most of these he was ignorant who they were, but he saw two or three that he knew, and tried to approach them and talk with them, but they would not listen to him, and did not seem to be in their right minds, but out of their senses and distraught, avoiding every sight and touch, and at first turned round and round alone, but afterwards meeting many other souls whirling round ard in the same condition as themselves, they moved about pro­ miscuously with no particular object in view, and uttered inarticulate sounds, like yells, mixed with wailing and terror.", "4487": "Other souls in the upper part of the air seemed joyful, and frequently approached one another in a friendly way, and avoided those troubled souls, and seemed to mark their displeasure by keeping themselves to themselves, and their joy and delight by extension and expansion.", "4488": "At last he said he saw the soul of a relation, that he thought he knew but was not quite sure, as he died when he was a boy, which came up to him and said to him, \" Welcome, Thespesius.\"", "4489": "And he wondering, and saying that his name was not Thespesius but Aridæus, the soul replied, \" That was your old name, but henceforth it will be Thespesius.", "4490": "For assuredly you are not dead, but by the will of the gods are come here with your intellect, for the rest of your soul you have left in the body like an anchor ;", "4491": "and as a proof of what I say both now and hereafter notice that the souls of the dead have no shadow and do not move their eyelids.\"", "4492": "Thespesius, on hearing these words, pulled himself some­ what more together again, and began to use his reason, and looking more closely he noticed that an indistinct and shadow-like line was suspended over him, while the others shone all round and were transparent, but were not all alike;", "4493": "for some were like the full-moon at its brightest, throwing out one smooth even and continuous colour, others had spots or light marks here and there, while others were quite variegated and strange to the sight, with black spots like snakes, while others again had dim scratches.", "4494": "Then the kinsman of Thespesius (for there is nothing to prevent our calling the souls by the name of the persons), pointed out everything, and told him that Adrastea, the daughter of Necessity and Zeus, was placed in the highest position to punish all crimes, and no criminal was either so great or so small as to be able to escape her either by fraud or violence.", "4495": "But, as there were three kinds of punishment, each had its own officer and administering functionary. \"", "4496": "For speedy Vengeance undertakes the punish­ ment of those that are to be corrected at once in the body and through their bodies, and she mildly passes by many offences that only need expiation;", "4497": "but if the cure of vice demands further pains, then the deity hands over such criminals after death to Justice, and those whom Justice rejects as altogether incurable, Erinnys (the third and fiercest of Adrastea's officers), pursues as they are fleeing and wandering about in various directions, and with pitiless severity utterly undoes them all, and thrusts them down to a place not to be seen or spoken about.", "4498": "And, of all these punishments, that which is administered in this life by Vengeance is most like those in use among the barbarians.", "4499": "For as among the Persians they pluck off and scourge the garments and tiaras of those that are to be punished, while the offenders weep and beg them to cease, so most punish­ ments by fine or bodily chastisement have no sharp touch, nor do they reach vice itself, but are only for show and sentiment.", "4500": "And whoever goes from this world to that incorrigible and impure, Justice takes him aside, naked as he is in soul, and unable to veil or hide or conceal his villainy, but descried all round and in all points by every­ body, and shows him first to his good parents, if such they were, to let them see what a wretch he is and how unworthy of his ancestors ;", "4501": "but if they were wicked too, seeing them punished and himself being seen by them, he is chastised for a long time till he is purged of each of his bad propen­ sities by sufferings and pains, which as much exceed in magnitude and intensity all sufferings in the flesh, as what is real is more vivid than a dream.", "4502": "But the scars and marks of the stripes for each bad propensity are more visible in some than in others.", "4503": "Observe also, he continued, the dif­ ferent and various colours of the souls.", "4504": "That dark dirty­ brown colour is the pigment of illiberality and covetous­ ness, and the blood-red the sign of cruelty and savageness, and where the blue is there sensuality and love of pleasure are not easily eradicated, and that violet and livid colour marks malice and envy, like the dark liquid ejected by the cuttle fish.", "4505": "For as during life vice produces these colours by the soul being acted upon by passions and reacting upon the body, so here it is the end of purification and correc­ tion when they are toned down, and the soul becomes alto­ gether bright and one colour.", "4506": "But as long as these colours remain, there are relapses of the passions accompanied by palpitation and throbbing of the heart, in some faint and soon suppressed, in others more violent and lasting.", "4507": "And some of these souls by being again and again corrected recover their proper disposition and condition, while others again by their violent ignorance and excessive love of plea­ sure 1 are carried into the bodies of animals;", "4508": "for one by weakness of reasoning power, and slowness of contempla­ tion, is impelled by the practical element in him to gene­ ration, while another, lacking an instrument to satisfy his licentiousness, desires to gratify his passions immediately, and to get that gratification through the medium of the body;", "4509": "for here there is no real fruition, but only an imper­ fect shadow and dream of incomplete pleasure.", "4510": "\"After he had said this, Thespesius' kinsman hurried him at great speed through immense space, as it seemed to him, though be travelled as easily and straight as if he were carried on the wings of the sun's rays.", "4511": "At last he got to an extensive and bottomless abyss, where his strength left him, as he found was the case with the other souls there:", "4512": "for keeping together and making swoops, like birds, they flitted all round the abyss, but did not venture to pass over it.", "4513": "To internal view it resembled the caverns of Bacchus, being beautiful throughout2 with trees and green foliage and flowers of all kinds, and it breathed a soft and gentle air, laden with scents marvellously pleasant, and producing the effect that wine does on those who are topers ;", "4514": "for the souls were elevated by its fragrance, and gay and blithe with one another:", "4515": "and the whole spot was full of mirth and laughter, and such songs as emanate from gaiety and enjoyment.", "4516": "And Thespesius' kinsman told him that this was the way Dionysus went up to heaven by, and by which he afterwards took up Semele, and it was called the place of Oblivion.", "4517": "But he would not let Thespesius stay there, much as he wished, but forcibly dragged him away, instructing and telling him that the intellect was melted and moistened by pleasure, and that the irrational and corporeal element being watered and made flesh stirs up the memory of the body, from which comes a yearning and strong de­ sire for generation, so called from being an inclination to the earthy when the soul is weighed down with moisture.", "4518": "Next Thespesius travelled as far in another direction, and seemed to see a great crater into which several rivers emptied themselves, one whiter than the foam of the sea or snow, another like the purple of the rainbow, and others of various hues whose brightness was apparent at some distance, but when he got nearer the air became thinner and the colours grew dim, and the crater lost all its gay colours but white.", "4519": "And he saw three genii sitting together in a triangular position, mixing the rivers together in certain proportions.", "4520": "Then the guide of Thespesius' soul told him, that Orpheus got as far as here, when he came in quest of the soul of his wife,1 and from not exactly remembering what he had seen spread a false report among mankind, that the oracle at Delphi was common to A polio and Night, though Apollo had no communion with Night:", "4521": "but this, pursued the guide, is an oracle common to Night and the Moon, that utters forth its oracular knowledge in no particular part of the world, nor has it any particular seat, but wanders about everywhere in men's dreams and visions.", "4522": "Hence, as you see, dreams receive and disseminate a mixture2 of simple truth with deceit and error.", "4523": "But the oracle of Apollo you do not know, nor can you see it, for the earthiness of the soul does not suffer it to soar upwards, but keeps it down in depen­ dence on the body.", "4524": "And taking him nea rer his guide tried to show him the light from the tripod, which, as he said, shone as far as Parnassus through the bosom of Themis, but though he desired to see it he could not for its brightness, but as he passed by he heard the shrill voice of a woman speaking in verse several things, among others, bethought, telling the time of his death.", "4525": "That, said the genius, was the voice of the Sibyl, who sang about the future as she was being borne about in the Orb of the moon.", "4526": "Though desirous then to hear more, he was conveyed into another direction by the violent motion of the moon, as if he had been in the eddies of a whirlpool, so that he heard very little more, only a prophecy about Mt. Vesuvius and that Dicæirchia3 would be destroyed by fire, and a short piece about the Emperor then reigning that though he was good he would lose his empire through sickness.", "4527": "\"After this Thespesius and his guide turned to see those that were undergoing punishment.", "4528": "And at first they saw only distressing and pitiable sights, but after that, Thespe­ sius, little expecting it, found himself among his friends and acquaintances and kinsfolk who were being punished, and undergoing dreadful sufferings and hideous and bitter tortures, and who wept and wailed to him.", "4529": "And at last he descried his father coming up out of a certain gulf covered with marks and scars, stretching out his hands, and not allowed to keep silence, but compelled by those that presided over his torture to confess that he had been an accursed wretch and poisoned some strangers that had gold, and during his lifetime had escaped the detection of everybody;", "4530": "but had been found out here, and his guilt brought home to him, for which he had already suffered much, and was being dragged on to suffer more.", "4531": "So great was his consternation and fear that he did not dare to intercede or beg for his father's release, but wishing to turn and flee he could no longer see his gentle and kind guide, but he was thrust forward by some persons horrible to look at, as if some dire necessity compelled him to go through with the business, and saw that the shades of those that had been notorious criminals and punished in their life-time were not so severely tortured here or like the others, but had an incomplete2 though toilsome punish­ ment for their irrational passions.", "4532": "3", "4533": "Whereas those who under the mask and show of virtue had lived all their lives in undetected vice were forced by their torturers with labour and pain to turn their souls inside out, unnaturally wriggling and writhing about, like the sea-scolopendras who, when they have swallowed the hook, turn themselves inside out;", "4534": "but some of them their torturers flayed and crimped so as to show their various inward vices which were only skinned over, which were deep in their soul the principal part of man.", "4535": "And he said he saw other souls, like snakes two or three or even more twined together, devouring one another in malignity and malevolence for what they had suffered or done in life.", "4536": "He said also that there were several lakes running parallel, one of boiling gold, another most cold of lead, another hard of iron, and several demons were standing by, like smiths, who lowered down and drew up by turns with instruments the souls of those whose criminality lay in insatiable cupidity.", "4537": "For when they were red-hot and transparent through their bath in the lake of gold, the demons thrust them into the lake of lead and dipped them in that;", "4538": "and when they got congealed in it and hard as hail, they dipped them into the lake of iron, and there they became wonderfully black, and broken and crushed by the hardness of the iron, and changed their appearance, and after that they were dipped again in the lake of gold, after suffering, he said, dreadful agony in all these changes of torment.", "4539": "But he said those souls suffered most piteously of all that, when they seemed to have escaped justice, were arrested again, and these were those whose crimes had been visited on their children or descendants.", "4540": "For whenever one of these latter happened to come up, he fell into a rage and cried out, and showed the marks of what he had suffered, and upbraided and pur­ sued the soul of the parent, that wished to fly and hide himself but could not.", "4541": "For quickly did the ministers of torture pursue them, and hurry them back again to Jus.", "4542": "tice,1 wailing all the while on account of their fore-know­ ledge of what their punishment would be.", "4543": "And to some of them he said many of their posterity clung at once, and just like bees or bats stuck to them, and squeaked and gib­ bered 2 in their rage at the memory of what they had suf­ fered owing to them.", "4544": "Last of all he saw the souls of those that were to come into the world a second time, forcibly moulded and transformed into various kinds of animals by artificers appointed for the very purpose with instruments and blows, who broke off all the limbs of some, and only wrenched off some of others, and polished others down or annihilated them altogether, to fit them for other habits and modes of life.", "4545": "Among them he saw the soul of Nero tortured in other ways, and pierced with red-hot nails.", "4546": "And the artificers having taken it in hand and converted it into the semblance of a Pindaric viper, which gets its way to life by gnawing through its mothers womb, a great light, he said, suddenly shone, and a voice came out of the light, ordering them to change it into something milder, so they devised of it the animal that croaks about lakes and marshes, for he had been punished sufficiently for his crimes, and now deserved some favour at the hands of the gods, for he had freed Greece, the noblest nation of his sub­ jects and the best-beloved of the gods.", "4547": "1", "4548": "So much did Thespesius behold, but as he intended to return a horrible dread came upon him.", "4549": "For a woman, marvellous in appearance and size, took hold of him and said to him, \" Come here that you may the better remember everything you have seen.\"", "4550": "And she was about to strike him with a red-hot iron pin, such as the encaustic painters use,2 when another woman prevented her ;", "4551": "and be was suddenly sucked up, as through3 a pipe, by a strong and violent wind, and lit upon his own body, and woke up and found that he was close to his tomb.", "4552": "§ i. Plato in his Laws' does not permit neighbours to use one another's water, unless they have first dug for themselves as far as the clay, and reached ground that is unsuitable for a well.", "4553": "For clay, having a rich and com­ pact nature, absorbs the water it receives, and does not let it pass through.", "4554": "But he allows people that cannot make a well of their own to use their neighbour's water, for the law ought to relieve necessity.", "4555": "Ought there not also to be a law about money, that people should not borrow of others, nor go to other people's sources of income, until they have first examined their own resources at home, and col­ lected, as by drops, what is necessary for their use ?", "4556": "But nowadays from luxury and effeminacy and lavish expendi­ ture people do not use their own resources, though they have them, but borrow from others at great interest with­ out necessity.", "4557": "And what proves this very clearly is the fact that people do not lend money to the needy, but only to those who, wanting an immediate supply, bring a wit­ ness and adequate security for their credit, so that they can be in no actual necessity of borrowing.", "4558": "1§ II.",

goods out at pawn cannot be saved even by Zeus the Protector of Property :", "4565": "they are ashamed to sell, they are not ashamed to pay interest on their goods when out at pawn.", "4566": "And yet the famous Peri­ cles made the ornament of Athene, which weighed forty talents of fine gold, removable at will, for “so,” he said, \"we can use the gold in war, and at some other time restore as costly a one.\"", "4567": "So should we too in our necessities, as in a siege, not receive a garrison imposed on us by a hostile money-lender, nor allow our goods to go into slavery ;", "4568": "but

Median war that the god had given them wooden walls,2 and they left the region and city, their goods and houses, and took refuge in their ships for liberty, so the god gives us a wooden table, and

all round, and ruin and choke cities.", "4592": "They say that hares at once give birth and suckle and conceive again, but the debts of these knaves and barbarians give birth before they conceive ;",

fellow-worker.", "4883": "Thus Thucydides the Athenian wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians in Thrace near the forest of Scapte, Xenophon wrote at Scillus in Elis, Philistus in Epirus, Timæus of Taurome­ nium at Athens, Androtion of Athens at Megara, and Bacchylides the poet in Peloponnesus.", "4884": "All these and many more, though exiled from their country, did not despair or give themselves up to dejection, but so happy was their disposition that they considered exile a resource given them by fortune, whereby they obtained universal fame after their

banished one, or Aristophon the accuser rather than Timotheus who got driven by him from his country.", "4891": "§ xvi.", "4892": "But since a good many are moved by the lines of Euripides, who seems
